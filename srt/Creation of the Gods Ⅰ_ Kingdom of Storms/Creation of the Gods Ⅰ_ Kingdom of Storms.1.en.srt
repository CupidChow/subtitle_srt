1
00:01:18,625 --> 00:01:19,958
ADAPTED FROM
THE INVESTITURE OF THE GODS

2
00:01:20,041 --> 00:01:21,166
AND KING ZHOU'S ATTACK
OF THE SHANG

3
00:01:36,375 --> 00:01:39,750
<i>At the beginning of time,
the world was shapeless.</i>

4
00:01:41,166 --> 00:01:42,916
<i>Separating the sky and earth,</i>

5
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,500
<i>Pangu turned his body into the sun,
the moon, the mountains, and the rivers.</i>

6
00:01:46,583 --> 00:01:49,041
<i>The world was thus created.</i>

7
00:01:51,083 --> 00:01:53,000
<i>Nuwa made figurines out of clay,</i>

8
00:01:53,083 --> 00:01:55,791
<i>imparting her own spirit to give them life</i>

9
00:01:56,291 --> 00:01:58,291
<i>and humans were thus created.</i>

10
00:02:01,583 --> 00:02:04,708
<i>Before she died,
Nuwa left behind a sacred artifact</i>

11
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:07,583
<i>called Fengshen Bang</i>

12
00:02:08,583 --> 00:02:11,291
<i>and appointed
the Immortals of Kunlun to guard it.</i>

13
00:02:11,375 --> 00:02:14,041
<i>It had the power to save the world</i>

14
00:02:14,125 --> 00:02:18,250
<i>and could only be opened
by the King of All Realms.</i>

15
00:02:20,791 --> 00:02:22,875
<i>As the generations came and went,</i>

16
00:02:22,958 --> 00:02:25,125
<i>Cheng Tang established the Shang dynasty.</i>

17
00:02:25,625 --> 00:02:28,291
<i>The Four Dukes of the East,
West, South, and North</i>

18
00:02:28,375 --> 00:02:30,500
<i>together with the 800 lords under them</i>

19
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:34,458
<i>acknowledged the Shang monarch
as the King of All Realms.</i>

20
00:02:35,416 --> 00:02:36,833
<i>But there came a time,</i>

21
00:02:36,916 --> 00:02:39,625
<i>five hundred years
into the reign of the Shang,</i>

22
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:43,916
<i>when Su Hu, Lord of Jizhou,
refused to submit his tribute</i>

23
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:47,458
<i>and rebelled against the Shang‘s King Yi.</i>

24
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:51,666
<i>After a long and bitter siege,</i>

25
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:55,750
<i>King Yi sent his second son,
Yin Shou, into battle.</i>

26
00:02:56,833 --> 00:03:03,416
<i>Yin Shou led a special force
trained by his own hand.</i>

27
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:14,750
JIZHOU

28
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:25,666
YIN

29
00:04:28,791 --> 00:04:30,916
<i>I'm Ji Fa, son of Ji Chang,
Duke of the West.</i>

30
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,625
JI FA, SON OF THE DUKE OF THE WEST

31
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:35,791
<i>Riding by my side
is my best friend, Yin Jiao.</i>

32
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:37,541
YIN JIAO, SON OF YIN SHOU

33
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:41,833
<i>His father is our commander and hero.</i>

34
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:46,541
<i>I hope to become just like him one day.</i>

35
00:04:49,291 --> 00:04:52,166
YIN SHOU,
SECOND SON OF THE KING OF SHANG

36
00:04:57,875 --> 00:05:00,500
SU QUANXIAO, SECOND SON OF SU HU

37
00:05:06,916 --> 00:05:07,791
State your name.

38
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:10,666
Su Quanxiao, son of Su Hu, Lord of Jizhou.

39
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:13,333
Louder, so they can hear you.

40
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:22,666
Su Quanxiao, son of Su Hu, Lord of Jizhou!

41
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:23,583
State your rank.

42
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:26,625
Centurion of the Shang Hostage Brigade,

43
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:28,458
North Battalion.

44
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:29,958
Tell us why you're a hostage.

45
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:34,291
The 800 lords of the East,
West, South, and North are required

46
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:36,291
to send one of their sons

47
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:37,916
to be hostages of the Shang court.

48
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,250
If any lord plots against the king,

49
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:42,583
his hostage son is to be executed first

50
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:45,083
and followed by his entire family!

51
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:46,958
Your father, Su Hu,

52
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:48,416
has led Jizhou in rebellion.

53
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:53,625
Go talk some sense into him.

54
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:10,541
Father!

55
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:13,125
Please surrender!

56
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,916
I've been away for eight years.

57
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,083
I've grown up.

58
00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:17,750
My father doesn't recognize me!

59
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:21,166
That man doesn't deserve
to be your father.

60
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:27,958
You're my son.

61
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:34,083
And now, you have to be my bravest son.

62
00:07:46,541 --> 00:07:48,000
Farewell,

63
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,750
Father.

64
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:17,666
JI

65
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,083
ZHENG LUN, VICE-LORD
SU HU, LORD OF JIZHOU

66
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:20,416
Just now,

67
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,333
right before your eyes,

68
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:25,875
one of your brothers died!

69
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:28,541
One of my sons died!

70
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:31,666
Who killed him?

71
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,583
- The traitor Su Hu!
- The traitor Su Hu!

72
00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:35,416
Who was it that killed him?

73
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,583
- The traitor Su Hu!
- The traitor Su Hu!

74
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:39,708
Who was it that killed him?

75
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:41,708
- The traitor Su Hu!
- The traitor Su Hu!

76
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:45,083
- The traitor Su Hu!
- The traitor Su Hu!

77
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:46,291
Fire!

78
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:36,458
Warriors of Shang,

79
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:38,583
annihilate Jizhou!

80
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:40,583
- Annihilate Jizhou!
- Annihilate Jizhou!

81
00:09:40,666 --> 00:09:43,125
- Annihilate Jizhou!
- Annihilate Jizhou!

82
00:09:46,416 --> 00:09:49,375
Attack!

83
00:09:49,916 --> 00:09:51,458
Ji Fa, come on!

84
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:55,416
Watch out!

85
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,833
Attack!

86
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:01,250
Fire!

87
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,541
Attack!

88
00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:24,333
Into the breach!

89
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,416
- Attack!
- Attack!

90
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:49,750
Make way!

91
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:37,125
Ji Fa!

92
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:40,291
Ji Fa!

93
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:49,750
Yin Jiao,

94
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:51,291
you retreated in fear.

95
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:53,625
- You're a disappointment.
- Forgive me, Father!

96
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:56,208
Commander, it wasn't us!

97
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:59,125
The horses bolted when they saw the fire.

98
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:02,458
Father!

99
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:08,666
The horses see

100
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,250
what we allow them to see!

101
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,666
Faster!

102
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:27,041
Attack!

103
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:34,083
- Attack!
- Attack!

104
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:38,708
- Attack!
- Attack!

105
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:40,375
Attack!

106
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:42,666
- Attack!
- Attack!

107
00:13:01,708 --> 00:13:02,875
<i>After the city was taken,</i>

108
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:05,833
<i>we chased the Su family
all the way to Xuanyuan Tomb.</i>

109
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:06,833
XUANYUAN TOMB

110
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:08,291
<i>We were determined</i>

111
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:10,125
<i>to chop off Su Hu's head</i>

112
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:12,000
<i>to avenge Su Quanxiao.</i>

113
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:16,750
Quanzhong.

114
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:17,750
SU QUANZHONG, ELDEST SON OF SU HU

115
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:20,333
Quanzhong.

116
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:24,333
Never forget.

117
00:14:24,416 --> 00:14:25,708
The Su family of Jizhou

118
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:27,625
will never submit to the King of Shang!

119
00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:11,208
Father.

120
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:25,875
Run!

121
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:26,041
Watch out.

122
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:59,458
It's a woman.

123
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:03,500
Who is she?

124
00:17:04,416 --> 00:17:05,875
Su Hu's daughter,

125
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:07,458
Su Daji.

126
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,708
The daughter of a traitor

127
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:13,208
must be put to death.

128
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:15,583
Ji Fa,

129
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:17,958
kill her.

130
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:18,875
What?

131
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:20,708
Kill a woman?

132
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,083
I can't.

133
00:17:25,208 --> 00:17:26,083
Jiang Wenhuan,

134
00:17:26,791 --> 00:17:27,916
you do it.

135
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,208
E Shun, you do it.

136
00:17:29,958 --> 00:17:31,083
Why don't you do it?

137
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:41,458
My hairpin.

138
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:49,833
- Ji Fa.
- Ji Fa.

139
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:11,125
It would be a waste

140
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:13,375
to kill such a woman.

141
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:15,875
Let's give her to the commander.

142
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:17,750
You losers.

143
00:18:18,583 --> 00:18:19,500
I'll do it.

144
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:20,875
- Yin Jiao.
- Yin Jiao.

145
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:29,333
Commander.

146
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:31,791
- Commander.
- Commander.

147
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:49,125
Here! A toast to us!

148
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:51,250
Warriors of the Shang dynasty!

149
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:52,750
- Come on.
- Come on.

150
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:54,416
- Cheers.
- Drink up.

151
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,583
I want to make a toast

152
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:58,041
to our brother,

153
00:18:58,583 --> 00:18:59,791
Su Quanxiao.

154
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:02,125
- To our brother.
- To our brother.

155
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:04,375
The son of the traitor Su Hu

156
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:07,083
doesn't deserve to be our brother.

157
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:09,458
He isn't his father.

158
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:11,875
His father may have been a traitor,

159
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:13,583
but Su Quanxiao did nothing wrong.

160
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:15,666
- That's right.
- Like father, like son.

161
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:18,625
Your father, Ji Chang, Duke of the West,

162
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:20,666
knows nothing but plowing the fields.

163
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,708
Even in that armor, Ji Fa,

164
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:24,875
you're still just a farmer from Xiqi,

165
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:27,583
reeking of manure!

166
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,416
Manure!

167
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,208
- Let's drink.
- Come on!

168
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:33,458
Your father,
Chong Houhu, Duke of the North,

169
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:37,708
knows nothing but hunting animals.

170
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:40,208
Even in that armor,

171
00:19:40,791 --> 00:19:42,000
you're still

172
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:43,666
just a hunter,

173
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:44,916
reeking of what?

174
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,291
- What?
- What does he reek of?

175
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:48,708
Beasts.

176
00:20:56,458 --> 00:20:58,166
I know what you want.

177
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:16,875
You want

178
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:24,458
to be the king of the whole world.

179
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:39,541
Do you know what happens
to the daughters of traitors?

180
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:45,750
At dawn, you'll be offered
as a sacrifice to our banner.

181
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:50,708
I'm different from the others.

182
00:21:52,583 --> 00:21:53,833
I can help you.

183
00:22:26,333 --> 00:22:30,500
ZHAOGE

184
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:32,833
<i>After being a hostage
in Zhaoge for eight years,</i>

185
00:22:33,583 --> 00:22:34,458
<i>on this day,</i>

186
00:22:34,958 --> 00:22:37,500
<i>I finally return as a hero</i>

187
00:22:38,166 --> 00:22:40,958
<i>to the welcoming cheers
of the entire city.</i>

188
00:23:03,916 --> 00:23:07,041
SHANG

189
00:23:27,583 --> 00:23:30,708
I, Yin Shou,
bow to His Majesty and His Highness.

190
00:23:30,791 --> 00:23:32,166
YIN QI, ELDEST SON OF KING YI,
KING YI OF SHANG

191
00:23:39,708 --> 00:23:40,916
To you, Father,

192
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,250
I present Su Hu's head.

193
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:54,625
And to you, my brother,

194
00:23:54,708 --> 00:23:56,000
the battle flag of Jizhou.

195
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:04,875
Su Hu,

196
00:24:05,625 --> 00:24:06,750
you once declared

197
00:24:07,333 --> 00:24:08,916
that you would never bow to me.

198
00:24:09,583 --> 00:24:10,875
And yet, here you are--

199
00:24:10,958 --> 00:24:12,416
At the victory banquet tomorrow,

200
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,333
we'll use his skull as a goblet

201
00:24:14,416 --> 00:24:16,375
and drink from it until daybreak!

202
00:24:17,375 --> 00:24:21,458
- King of Shang, King of All Realms!
- King of Shang, King of All Realms!

203
00:24:21,541 --> 00:24:25,291
- King of Shang, King of All Realms!
- King of Shang, King of All Realms!

204
00:24:25,791 --> 00:24:28,375
The Hostage Brigade, returning in victory,

205
00:24:28,458 --> 00:24:32,166
will perform a war dance for His Majesty.

206
00:24:37,083 --> 00:24:38,041
Attack!

207
00:24:44,125 --> 00:24:46,500
Long live Your Majesty.

208
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:03,541
My son.

209
00:25:04,208 --> 00:25:07,583
My dearest son dances for me.

210
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:11,000
Excellent.

211
00:25:53,833 --> 00:25:54,833
Encircle him.

212
00:25:56,916 --> 00:25:58,041
Shields!

213
00:26:40,083 --> 00:26:40,916
Your Highness.

214
00:26:47,541 --> 00:26:48,625
He's dead.

215
00:26:49,833 --> 00:26:51,000
Ji Fa,

216
00:26:51,666 --> 00:26:53,541
you killed a prince of Shang.

217
00:26:54,125 --> 00:26:55,916
Your entire family will be executed.

218
00:26:56,541 --> 00:26:57,500
Ji Fa.

219
00:26:59,125 --> 00:27:01,625
Killing a prince is a serious crime

220
00:27:01,708 --> 00:27:03,916
and the penalty is death.

221
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,125
What a horrific crime.

222
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:06,916
Well…

223
00:27:12,125 --> 00:27:13,041
Father.

224
00:27:34,916 --> 00:27:36,666
My brother, Yin Qi,

225
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:38,500
killed our father, the king.

226
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:43,333
Ji Fa.

227
00:27:48,791 --> 00:27:51,125
What you did wasn't only justified,

228
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:55,166
but also a service to our kingdom.

229
00:28:33,041 --> 00:28:35,041
<i>If Yin Jiao hadn't spoken for me</i>

230
00:28:35,125 --> 00:28:36,958
<i>and the commander hadn't shown mercy,</i>

231
00:28:37,041 --> 00:28:39,333
<i>my whole family would have been executed.</i>

232
00:28:40,208 --> 00:28:42,125
<i>However, now that the king is dead,</i>

233
00:28:42,208 --> 00:28:44,958
<i>what will become of the Shang dynasty?</i>

234
00:29:07,125 --> 00:29:10,666
<i>So this is why the Supreme One
summoned the 12 of us here</i>

235
00:29:11,375 --> 00:29:13,000
<i>to Yuxu Palace.</i>

236
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:15,166
<i>The mortal world is in misery.</i>

237
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:17,666
<i>Is this the future of all humanity?</i>

238
00:29:19,125 --> 00:29:20,833
<i>Is this the Great Curse, Supreme One?</i>

239
00:29:21,541 --> 00:29:23,583
<i>What have the mortals done
to deserve this?</i>

240
00:29:24,208 --> 00:29:25,958
<i>When wars are raging</i>

241
00:29:26,041 --> 00:29:27,416
<i>and demons become rampant,</i>

242
00:29:27,958 --> 00:29:30,083
<i>the Great Curse is sure to befall all.</i>

243
00:29:30,166 --> 00:29:31,208
THE SUPREME ONE

244
00:29:31,291 --> 00:29:32,458
<i>In the beginning,</i>

245
00:29:32,541 --> 00:29:34,416
<i>when Pangu broke through the chaos,</i>

246
00:29:35,041 --> 00:29:36,666
<i>the pure qi rose to form the sky</i>

247
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:38,791
<i>and the impure qi
descended to form the earth.</i>

248
00:29:38,875 --> 00:29:40,541
<i>The sky and earth were thus created</i>

249
00:29:40,625 --> 00:29:42,208
<i>and life flourished.</i>

250
00:29:43,166 --> 00:29:44,916
<i>The Great Curse will cause everything</i>

251
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,666
<i>to be reversed.</i>

252
00:29:47,333 --> 00:29:49,708
<i>The world is falling back into chaos</i>

253
00:29:49,791 --> 00:29:51,416
<i>and all life will be extinguished.</i>

254
00:29:52,291 --> 00:29:55,208
<i>Although the mortals probably deserve it,</i>

255
00:29:55,291 --> 00:29:58,583
<i>we can't just sit here and do nothing.</i>

256
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:01,500
<i>Lady Nuwa left Fengshen Bang</i>

257
00:30:01,583 --> 00:30:03,250
<i>under our guard here in Kunlun</i>

258
00:30:03,333 --> 00:30:06,291
<i>precisely because she foresaw this day.</i>

259
00:30:06,875 --> 00:30:10,416
<i>It's time for Fengshen Bang
to be delivered unto the world.</i>

260
00:30:11,166 --> 00:30:13,583
<i>As soon as Fengshen Bang is placed</i>

261
00:30:13,666 --> 00:30:15,541
<i>into the hands of the King of All Realms</i>

262
00:30:15,625 --> 00:30:17,583
<i>and he unseals it
and invests the new gods,</i>

263
00:30:17,666 --> 00:30:19,625
<i>the Great Curse will be lifted</i>

264
00:30:19,708 --> 00:30:21,541
<i>and humanity will be saved.</i>

265
00:30:21,625 --> 00:30:23,833
<i>I'm sure you're aware
of the price one must pay</i>

266
00:30:23,916 --> 00:30:26,333
<i>to be the bearer of Fengshen Bang.</i>

267
00:30:27,041 --> 00:30:29,000
<i>Supreme One, allow me.</i>

268
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:31,083
<i>It should be me this time.</i>

269
00:30:31,625 --> 00:30:33,083
<i>I'll do it.</i>

270
00:30:33,166 --> 00:30:34,750
<i>I should be the one.</i>

271
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:35,750
DAOHANG TIANZUN

272
00:30:35,833 --> 00:30:37,916
<i>There's no room for error.</i>

273
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,333
<i>We must let the Supreme One decide</i>

274
00:30:40,416 --> 00:30:42,250
<i>who the bearer shall be.</i>

275
00:30:53,333 --> 00:30:56,458
JIANG ZIYA

276
00:31:14,833 --> 00:31:17,750
NEZHA AND YANG JIAN

277
00:31:17,833 --> 00:31:21,166
MOUNT KUNLUN

278
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:22,458
Humanity is in dire peril.

279
00:31:22,541 --> 00:31:24,875
I'll deliver Fengshen Bang to them.

280
00:31:25,833 --> 00:31:26,750
<i>Ziya,</i>

281
00:31:27,458 --> 00:31:28,625
<i>you must be aware</i>

282
00:31:29,333 --> 00:31:32,166
<i>that when an immortal
touches Fengshen Bang,</i>

283
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:33,958
<i>they will lose all their powers,</i>

284
00:31:34,041 --> 00:31:35,416
<i>become mortal again,</i>

285
00:31:35,958 --> 00:31:38,583
<i>and therefore never return to Kunlun.</i>

286
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,166
All the more reason I should be the one.

287
00:31:43,958 --> 00:31:45,083
<i>And why is that?</i>

288
00:31:46,583 --> 00:31:47,625
<i>Do tell.</i>

289
00:31:48,416 --> 00:31:51,166
All of you have been practicing
for more than 1,000 years

290
00:31:51,666 --> 00:31:53,208
to achieve your current powers.

291
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:56,041
That mustn't be squandered.

292
00:31:56,125 --> 00:31:58,125
I've only been practicing for 40 years.

293
00:31:58,208 --> 00:31:59,416
It's no great tragedy

294
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,250
to lose the powers I have.

295
00:32:01,333 --> 00:32:03,000
And before I took up practicing,

296
00:32:03,083 --> 00:32:04,250
I was a merchant.

297
00:32:04,333 --> 00:32:07,541
I traveled quite often
and had a lot of worldly experiences.

298
00:32:09,083 --> 00:32:12,333
I humbly volunteer to take on this task.

299
00:32:12,916 --> 00:32:15,541
<i>Ziya, you haven't been with us for long</i>

300
00:32:15,625 --> 00:32:17,208
<i>and you're not yet able</i>

301
00:32:17,291 --> 00:32:19,250
<i>to see visions of the future,</i>

302
00:32:19,333 --> 00:32:21,666
<i>which is why I didn't summon you today.</i>

303
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:24,750
<i>And yet, your intrusion,
driven by your sympathy</i>

304
00:32:24,833 --> 00:32:26,166
<i>for the mortals,</i>

305
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:28,750
<i>disrupted our vision of the Great Curse.</i>

306
00:32:29,958 --> 00:32:33,791
<i>Could this be your destiny?</i>

307
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:52,083
DRAGON-BEARD TIGER

308
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:11,291
<i>Jiang Ziya,</i>

309
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,708
<i>are you truly ready to give up</i>

310
00:33:13,791 --> 00:33:16,416
<i>forty years of immortality and power</i>

311
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,500
<i>and go back to being a mortal?</i>

312
00:34:06,916 --> 00:34:13,708
The Great Black Bird

313
00:34:14,416 --> 00:34:21,125
gave birth to the Shang people.

314
00:34:22,708 --> 00:34:24,291
Ancestors, hear me!

315
00:34:24,833 --> 00:34:28,583
I, Yin Shou, never desired to be king,

316
00:34:28,666 --> 00:34:31,916
but the kingdom must have a ruler.

317
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,208
And I,
being my father's only living child,

318
00:34:35,291 --> 00:34:37,166
have no choice but to ascend the throne

319
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:39,708
and sustain the Shang dynasty.

320
00:34:39,791 --> 00:34:42,000
I now implore my uncle,
High Priest Bi Gan,

321
00:34:42,083 --> 00:34:43,916
to see into our kingdom's future.

322
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,541
BI GAN, KING YIN SHOU'S UNCLE

323
00:35:26,166 --> 00:35:27,083
QUEEN JIANG

324
00:35:51,916 --> 00:35:53,250
The dynasty is doomed.

325
00:35:53,333 --> 00:35:54,208
The dynasty is doomed.

326
00:35:54,291 --> 00:35:55,916
The dynasty is doomed.

327
00:35:58,958 --> 00:36:00,541
The dynasty is doomed.

328
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:07,500
The dynasty is doomed.

329
00:36:16,416 --> 00:36:18,041
Uncle, what are you saying?

330
00:36:18,125 --> 00:36:20,458
The gods foretold our doom

331
00:36:20,541 --> 00:36:23,458
by shattering our divination.

332
00:36:23,541 --> 00:36:25,625
What have we done
to deserve a curse like that?

333
00:36:25,708 --> 00:36:27,583
A member of our royal family

334
00:36:27,666 --> 00:36:30,625
killed his own father and king.

335
00:36:30,708 --> 00:36:34,458
No greater sin could have been committed.

336
00:36:34,541 --> 00:36:38,041
The gods have been enraged.

337
00:36:38,666 --> 00:36:40,250
We, descendants of Cheng Tang,

338
00:36:40,333 --> 00:36:43,083
are no longer fit
to be the King of All Realms.

339
00:36:43,958 --> 00:36:46,291
I'll sacrifice 100 human lives

340
00:36:46,375 --> 00:36:47,500
to quell their rage.

341
00:36:48,166 --> 00:36:49,375
It's useless.

342
00:36:49,458 --> 00:36:50,666
One thousand lives then.

343
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:54,458
Even 10,000 lives won't help.

344
00:36:54,541 --> 00:36:56,041
Back in the beginning,

345
00:36:56,125 --> 00:36:59,958
when our ancestor Cheng Tang
united the land,

346
00:37:00,458 --> 00:37:02,250
so many lives were taken

347
00:37:02,333 --> 00:37:03,833
that a Great Curse fell.

348
00:37:04,416 --> 00:37:08,000
A great drought of seven years

349
00:37:08,083 --> 00:37:10,583
left the land completely barren.

350
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:16,250
By building
and mounting a sacrificial pyre

351
00:37:16,333 --> 00:37:17,583
and immolating himself,

352
00:37:17,666 --> 00:37:20,166
Cheng Tang finally moved the gods

353
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:22,250
and lifted the curse.

354
00:37:22,333 --> 00:37:26,666
Are you suggesting I should do the same?

355
00:37:27,208 --> 00:37:28,958
How dare you, Granduncle!

356
00:37:35,958 --> 00:37:37,625
Father just ascended the throne

357
00:37:37,708 --> 00:37:39,750
and you want him to sacrifice himself.

358
00:37:39,833 --> 00:37:42,750
The very idea is treason.

359
00:37:42,833 --> 00:37:44,208
You fool!

360
00:37:44,291 --> 00:37:46,375
The Great Curse is just beginning.

361
00:37:46,458 --> 00:37:48,125
Before long,

362
00:37:48,208 --> 00:37:50,375
our people will be in misery.

363
00:37:50,458 --> 00:37:52,291
Our ancestors will be without offerings.

364
00:37:52,375 --> 00:37:53,375
When that time comes,

365
00:37:53,458 --> 00:37:56,416
the entire Shang dynasty will be no more!

366
00:37:58,916 --> 00:38:00,375
Father, pass the throne to me.

367
00:38:00,458 --> 00:38:02,541
I'll sacrifice myself in your place.

368
00:38:08,583 --> 00:38:09,791
What is a king

369
00:38:11,166 --> 00:38:14,333
if not the bearer of all earthly sins?

370
00:38:17,041 --> 00:38:19,875
I'll follow
our ancestor Cheng Tang's example

371
00:38:20,875 --> 00:38:23,333
and build a sacrificial pyre in Zhaoge.

372
00:38:24,791 --> 00:38:26,083
On the day it's completed,

373
00:38:26,666 --> 00:38:29,333
I'll burn myself as a sacrifice

374
00:38:29,416 --> 00:38:31,541
to save the kingdom!

375
00:38:34,583 --> 00:38:38,208
Blessed is the kingdom!

376
00:38:38,291 --> 00:38:40,583
Kneel!

377
00:38:41,625 --> 00:38:43,833
- Blessed is the kingdom!
- Blessed is the kingdom!

378
00:38:43,916 --> 00:38:46,166
- Blessed is the kingdom!
- Blessed is the kingdom!

379
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:48,208
Blessed is the kingdom!

380
00:38:48,291 --> 00:38:51,083
Kowtow!

381
00:39:05,875 --> 00:39:08,083
I waited outside Deer Terrace for an hour,

382
00:39:08,166 --> 00:39:09,333
but His Majesty

383
00:39:10,333 --> 00:39:11,500
refused to see me.

384
00:39:17,041 --> 00:39:18,500
I'll go fetch Father.

385
00:39:20,166 --> 00:39:22,041
You spoke out of turn today.

386
00:39:24,291 --> 00:39:26,041
You've aroused your father's mistrust.

387
00:39:26,625 --> 00:39:28,375
I asked him to pass the throne to me

388
00:39:29,125 --> 00:39:30,750
so that I could die in his place.

389
00:39:31,458 --> 00:39:32,833
Surely he must know that.

390
00:39:35,833 --> 00:39:37,375
You don't know your father.

391
00:39:39,125 --> 00:39:40,000
Mother,

392
00:39:41,875 --> 00:39:42,916
you worry too much.

393
00:39:44,208 --> 00:39:45,958
I'll bring Father here

394
00:39:46,041 --> 00:39:47,791
so that our family can be together.

395
00:41:04,666 --> 00:41:05,875
- Ji Fa.
- Yin Jiao.

396
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:08,458
There's a fox demon! Follow me!

397
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:12,958
DEER TERRACE

398
00:41:20,291 --> 00:41:21,875
Are you sure it went this way?

399
00:41:25,958 --> 00:41:26,791
There!

400
00:41:26,875 --> 00:41:28,083
In the Celestial Chamber!

401
00:41:39,083 --> 00:41:40,375
His Majesty is resting.

402
00:41:40,458 --> 00:41:42,208
No one is allowed to enter.

403
00:41:43,416 --> 00:41:44,750
My father is in danger.

404
00:41:44,833 --> 00:41:46,250
I don't have time for this.

405
00:42:18,208 --> 00:42:19,458
Who's there?

406
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,166
Father,

407
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:23,083
it's me.

408
00:42:23,666 --> 00:42:25,833
Barging in with a sword at this hour.

409
00:42:26,875 --> 00:42:28,666
Can't you wait

410
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:30,416
to sit on my throne?

411
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:31,541
I would never.

412
00:42:31,625 --> 00:42:33,250
I was chasing a fox…

413
00:42:34,208 --> 00:42:35,500
demon.

414
00:42:36,041 --> 00:42:38,708
We barged in here out of concern
for Your Majesty's safety.

415
00:42:38,791 --> 00:42:39,791
Please forgive us.

416
00:42:39,875 --> 00:42:41,041
What fox demon?

417
00:42:42,041 --> 00:42:43,208
What is she doing here?

418
00:42:44,375 --> 00:42:45,541
Get out!

419
00:42:46,125 --> 00:42:47,125
At once, Your Majesty.

420
00:42:55,541 --> 00:42:58,041
I should have killed Su Daji
when I first saw her!

421
00:42:58,958 --> 00:43:01,416
His Majesty is sacrificing himself
to save the world.

422
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:02,500
He's a hero.

423
00:43:06,583 --> 00:43:08,125
Don't upset him again.

424
00:43:12,166 --> 00:43:13,708
If it were your father,

425
00:43:14,333 --> 00:43:15,791
what would you do?

426
00:43:23,958 --> 00:43:25,416
<i>I've been away for eight years.</i>

427
00:43:26,666 --> 00:43:27,708
<i>My own father</i>

428
00:43:29,208 --> 00:43:31,250
<i>probably wouldn't
even recognize me anymore.</i>

429
00:43:44,583 --> 00:43:48,208
JI CHANG, DUKE OF THE WEST

430
00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:56,125
I'm afraid we will have
a bad harvest this year.

431
00:43:59,125 --> 00:44:01,458
With the Great Curse upon Zhaoge,

432
00:44:02,041 --> 00:44:06,083
even Xiqi is affected.

433
00:44:07,125 --> 00:44:08,958
Thanks to your precautions, Father,

434
00:44:09,041 --> 00:44:10,333
we have enough food stored

435
00:44:11,041 --> 00:44:12,791
for the next three years.

436
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:15,291
What about after that?

437
00:44:27,208 --> 00:44:28,583
In the span of one night,

438
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:30,833
the king and the eldest prince
were both killed.

439
00:44:31,458 --> 00:44:32,625
It's really strange.

440
00:44:33,708 --> 00:44:36,208
The new king should be so hasty
to ascend the throne

441
00:44:36,708 --> 00:44:40,000
and then immediately
summon the Four Dukes.

442
00:44:40,083 --> 00:44:41,416
I suspect dark intentions.

443
00:44:42,333 --> 00:44:45,041
This trip to Zhaoge
could be most treacherous.

444
00:44:45,833 --> 00:44:47,375
Please reconsider, Father.

445
00:44:48,125 --> 00:44:48,958
My lord.

446
00:44:50,416 --> 00:44:54,000
If I disobey the king, war will ensue

447
00:44:54,583 --> 00:44:58,291
and the entire kingdom will pay the price.

448
00:45:01,458 --> 00:45:04,291
Although the throne has changed hands,

449
00:45:05,333 --> 00:45:08,541
my duties remain the same.

450
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,541
I can take this chance to visit Ji Fa.

451
00:45:17,458 --> 00:45:18,875
It has been eight years.

452
00:45:19,791 --> 00:45:22,083
He must be as tall as you now.

453
00:45:24,458 --> 00:45:25,875
Maybe even taller.

454
00:45:32,833 --> 00:45:33,916
When I'm gone,

455
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,958
you're the guardian of Xiqi

456
00:45:36,875 --> 00:45:38,666
and you must keep it safe.

457
00:45:38,750 --> 00:45:40,416
No matter what happens,

458
00:45:41,750 --> 00:45:44,208
don't leave Xiqi.

459
00:45:47,666 --> 00:45:49,083
Safe return, Father.

460
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:18,625
Line up.

461
00:46:18,708 --> 00:46:19,750
Let them through.

462
00:46:20,458 --> 00:46:21,500
Stop pushing.

463
00:46:22,375 --> 00:46:23,708
Stop them.

464
00:46:23,791 --> 00:46:24,666
Stop pushing.

465
00:46:25,916 --> 00:46:27,916
Stay back, all of you!

466
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:28,833
Your pass.

467
00:46:28,916 --> 00:46:30,000
No pass, no entry.

468
00:46:30,750 --> 00:46:32,166
Do we need a pass?

469
00:46:32,916 --> 00:46:33,958
What a nuisance.

470
00:46:34,041 --> 00:46:36,583
Master Ziya,
I'll fly you in on my Fire Wheels.

471
00:46:36,666 --> 00:46:39,333
My Five Elements Teleportation is faster.

472
00:46:40,041 --> 00:46:41,166
When we set out,

473
00:46:41,250 --> 00:46:42,416
the Supreme One told us

474
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:44,583
to refrain from using our powers.

475
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:48,958
But the mortal world has its own tricks.

476
00:46:50,666 --> 00:46:51,791
Watch this.

477
00:46:55,958 --> 00:46:58,250
Good day, sir.

478
00:46:59,083 --> 00:47:00,000
Who are you?

479
00:47:01,666 --> 00:47:03,500
We are immortals

480
00:47:03,583 --> 00:47:06,125
who have come all the way from Kunlun.

481
00:47:06,208 --> 00:47:08,791
So we have no pass.

482
00:47:09,375 --> 00:47:10,541
No pass?

483
00:47:13,166 --> 00:47:14,791
But we have this.

484
00:47:20,375 --> 00:47:21,333
Take it.

485
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:25,875
What is this?

486
00:47:27,666 --> 00:47:28,875
An elixir.

487
00:47:29,958 --> 00:47:31,041
What does it do?

488
00:47:31,125 --> 00:47:32,125
What does it do?

489
00:47:32,708 --> 00:47:35,375
This elixir contains pure qi,

490
00:47:35,458 --> 00:47:37,125
the essence of water,

491
00:47:37,208 --> 00:47:38,916
the blessing of benevolent gods,

492
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:44,166
and the best of sky, earth, and man.

493
00:47:44,250 --> 00:47:45,125
One whiff.

494
00:47:45,208 --> 00:47:46,708
And you'll feel refreshed.

495
00:47:46,791 --> 00:47:49,000
- One taste.
- And all discomfort is gone.

496
00:47:49,083 --> 00:47:50,083
- One--
- Enough.

497
00:47:51,666 --> 00:47:55,000
Such an amazing elixir can't be bought

498
00:47:55,083 --> 00:47:57,541
no matter how much you're ready to offer.

499
00:47:58,125 --> 00:47:59,541
Consider it our gift to you,

500
00:47:59,625 --> 00:48:00,625
our new friend.

501
00:48:03,708 --> 00:48:06,416
Master Ziya, your mortal trick worked.

502
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:07,833
Come along.

503
00:48:07,916 --> 00:48:10,125
- I'll take good care of you.
- You're too kind.

504
00:48:10,208 --> 00:48:12,375
I'll drive you into the city myself.

505
00:48:14,125 --> 00:48:16,208
Must His Majesty
sacrifice himself on the pyre

506
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:20,291
to dispel the Great Curse?

507
00:48:28,291 --> 00:48:29,333
Perhaps…

508
00:48:31,416 --> 00:48:32,791
only the gods know the answer.

509
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:41,000
We're here.

510
00:48:41,083 --> 00:48:42,166
Get off.

511
00:48:42,250 --> 00:48:43,500
Keep up.

512
00:48:43,583 --> 00:48:44,791
Hurry.

513
00:48:44,875 --> 00:48:45,833
Quickly.

514
00:49:09,250 --> 00:49:10,083
Master Ziya.

515
00:49:18,583 --> 00:49:25,583
SACRIFICIAL PYRE

516
00:49:53,416 --> 00:49:55,625
Hurry up.

517
00:49:56,416 --> 00:49:58,750
- Master Ziya, what's going on?
- Pull with all your strength.

518
00:50:00,416 --> 00:50:01,500
Hurry.

519
00:50:01,583 --> 00:50:02,750
Don't…

520
00:50:03,625 --> 00:50:05,041
It looks like

521
00:50:05,625 --> 00:50:06,625
we've been sold.

522
00:50:06,708 --> 00:50:07,625
Sold?

523
00:50:07,708 --> 00:50:10,875
I thought you knew your way around here.

524
00:50:12,750 --> 00:50:14,375
I haven't been back in 40 years.

525
00:50:14,458 --> 00:50:17,250
It wasn't like this before.

526
00:50:17,333 --> 00:50:18,541
Bring them over.

527
00:50:18,625 --> 00:50:19,750
Go. Hurry up.

528
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:23,500
Sir, we have something for His Majesty.

529
00:50:23,583 --> 00:50:24,875
Cut the crap.

530
00:50:46,791 --> 00:50:48,041
That's about enough.

531
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:57,958
This is bad.

532
00:51:05,333 --> 00:51:07,000
Quick, step back.

533
00:51:14,666 --> 00:51:15,958
Look.

534
00:51:17,958 --> 00:51:19,333
Thunderbolts.

535
00:51:21,666 --> 00:51:22,958
Go and save those people!

536
00:51:23,041 --> 00:51:24,166
- Can we use our powers?
- Can we use our powers?

537
00:51:24,250 --> 00:51:25,541
Of course.

538
00:51:25,625 --> 00:51:27,291
Finally!

539
00:52:12,166 --> 00:52:13,916
So the gods really do exist.

540
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,541
There's hope for His Majesty.

541
00:52:19,708 --> 00:52:22,208
<i>The alchemist Shen Gongbao</i>

542
00:52:22,291 --> 00:52:23,541
from Golden Turtle Island

543
00:52:23,625 --> 00:52:26,458
is here to demonstrate
his powers for His Majesty.

544
00:52:46,875 --> 00:52:48,250
The honor is mine.

545
00:52:54,416 --> 00:52:55,875
How fascinating.

546
00:52:55,958 --> 00:52:57,208
What sorcery is this?

547
00:52:57,291 --> 00:52:58,500
Your Majesty,

548
00:52:58,583 --> 00:53:01,541
with this spell,
I can survive a beheading.

549
00:53:02,041 --> 00:53:03,833
How about burning?

550
00:53:05,666 --> 00:53:08,291
If one is able to live without his head,

551
00:53:08,375 --> 00:53:11,541
a little fire is nothing to worry about.

552
00:53:12,083 --> 00:53:13,041
Perfect.

553
00:53:13,125 --> 00:53:15,166
How long does it take to master it?

554
00:53:15,250 --> 00:53:19,541
It took me 1,000 years.

555
00:53:19,625 --> 00:53:22,541
With Your Majesty's extraordinary talents,

556
00:53:23,125 --> 00:53:26,125
500 years should be enough.

557
00:53:27,333 --> 00:53:28,416
500 years?

558
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:29,541
That's right.

559
00:53:31,083 --> 00:53:31,958
How ludicrous!

560
00:53:32,041 --> 00:53:32,875
That hurts.

561
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:37,875
No! Don't!

562
00:53:40,375 --> 00:53:41,500
Here.

563
00:53:41,583 --> 00:53:42,750
Over here.

564
00:53:43,458 --> 00:53:44,375
Hurry up.

565
00:53:45,791 --> 00:53:48,791
Jiang Ziya, a Taoist master from Kunlun,

566
00:53:48,875 --> 00:53:51,125
has something to present to His Majesty.

567
00:53:59,791 --> 00:54:01,041
What is it?

568
00:54:01,125 --> 00:54:02,666
What I have here

569
00:54:03,291 --> 00:54:05,625
is Fengshen Bang.

570
00:54:08,916 --> 00:54:10,375
What does it do?

571
00:54:11,083 --> 00:54:13,666
A great turmoil is on the horizon.

572
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:16,708
I was sent by my master, the Supreme One,

573
00:54:16,791 --> 00:54:18,833
to bring Fengshen Bang

574
00:54:18,916 --> 00:54:21,666
to the King of All Realms.

575
00:54:22,541 --> 00:54:26,333
"The King of All Realms
invests the new gods."

576
00:54:26,916 --> 00:54:30,416
Once unsealed,
it will dispel the Great Curse

577
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:33,625
and all of humanity will be saved.

578
00:54:35,333 --> 00:54:37,333
Can such a small scroll

579
00:54:37,416 --> 00:54:38,958
really remove the Great Curse?

580
00:54:39,041 --> 00:54:41,333
More than that!

581
00:54:49,166 --> 00:54:53,333
Fengshen Bang is a sacred artifact
left behind by Lady Nuwa.

582
00:54:53,833 --> 00:54:58,166
It absorbs the qi of the dead,

583
00:54:58,750 --> 00:55:02,583
or what we may call “souls."

584
00:55:03,166 --> 00:55:06,458
Once Your Majesty unseals Fengshen Bang,

585
00:55:06,541 --> 00:55:10,125
all this energy will be yours

586
00:55:10,208 --> 00:55:13,458
to command.

587
00:55:14,041 --> 00:55:15,083
That means,

588
00:55:15,625 --> 00:55:16,916
the more people that die,

589
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:19,625
the more powerful Fengshen Bang becomes.

590
00:55:19,708 --> 00:55:21,791
Your Majesty is insightful.

591
00:55:22,375 --> 00:55:25,333
So the Great Curse
may in fact be a blessing.

592
00:55:25,416 --> 00:55:27,458
Your Majesty is all-knowing.

593
00:55:28,583 --> 00:55:30,041
This sorcerer is a demon.

594
00:55:30,125 --> 00:55:31,083
Well,

595
00:55:31,166 --> 00:55:32,833
reward them generously.

596
00:55:32,916 --> 00:55:34,083
Hang on.

597
00:55:34,958 --> 00:55:37,083
The authenticity

598
00:55:39,125 --> 00:55:41,416
of this Fengshen Bang

599
00:55:43,916 --> 00:55:46,666
has yet to be proven.

600
00:55:46,750 --> 00:55:48,250
How do we do that?

601
00:55:48,750 --> 00:55:52,208
I could do it

602
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,583
if I had a newly deceased human.

603
00:56:06,875 --> 00:56:09,458
Soul Revelation!

604
00:56:43,666 --> 00:56:47,583
Your Majesty is most decisive,

605
00:56:48,166 --> 00:56:50,875
but there is something else you must know.

606
00:56:51,416 --> 00:56:55,375
A pattern of steps is needed
to unseal Fengshen Bang.

607
00:56:55,958 --> 00:56:57,750
Let me show you.

608
00:56:57,833 --> 00:56:58,958
Watch carefully.

609
00:57:18,125 --> 00:57:19,375
What is this?

610
00:57:26,666 --> 00:57:28,500
Could it be

611
00:57:29,458 --> 00:57:32,583
Steps of the Cosmos?

612
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,958
Not so fast, Taoist friend.

613
00:57:36,041 --> 00:57:37,375
Run.

614
00:57:37,458 --> 00:57:38,583
Stop them.

615
00:57:47,875 --> 00:57:49,083
Don't kill anyone.

616
00:57:49,166 --> 00:57:50,000
Got it.

617
00:58:17,916 --> 00:58:18,958
Easy.

618
00:58:32,166 --> 00:58:33,166
Master Ziya.

619
00:58:47,958 --> 00:58:48,958
Yin Jiao, Ji Fa.

620
00:58:49,041 --> 00:58:50,583
Get Fengshen Bang.

621
00:58:54,750 --> 00:58:55,958
Come on.

622
00:58:56,458 --> 00:58:57,791
Get out of the way.

623
00:58:59,708 --> 00:59:00,833
Go after him.

624
00:59:28,958 --> 00:59:29,916
Water Teleportation.

625
00:59:56,458 --> 00:59:58,000
Ji Fa, you go that way.

626
01:00:30,625 --> 01:00:32,958
It's dangerous. Stop chasing me.

627
01:00:35,583 --> 01:00:36,458
Stop fleeing.

628
01:00:37,208 --> 01:00:38,333
It's a dead end.

629
01:00:38,416 --> 01:00:39,666
If you come closer,

630
01:00:39,750 --> 01:00:41,000
I'll jump.

631
01:00:41,083 --> 01:00:42,791
You've come all the way.

632
01:00:42,875 --> 01:00:44,166
Why change your mind now?

633
01:00:44,250 --> 01:00:46,166
Just pretend I was never here.

634
01:00:46,250 --> 01:00:48,125
That solves everything, doesn't it?

635
01:00:48,208 --> 01:00:49,708
Go back.

636
01:00:50,291 --> 01:00:52,583
Fengshen Bang belongs
to the King of All Realms

637
01:00:52,666 --> 01:00:53,916
and that king is my father.

638
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,625
What right do you have to keep it?

639
01:00:55,708 --> 01:00:57,500
I was going to give it to him,

640
01:00:57,583 --> 01:00:59,375
but I can't now.

641
01:00:59,458 --> 01:01:00,500
You despicable cheater.

642
01:01:04,708 --> 01:01:05,875
Tell me.

643
01:01:05,958 --> 01:01:08,125
What does it mean
to be the King of All Realms?

644
01:01:08,833 --> 01:01:12,000
If he can slaughter an innocent man,

645
01:01:12,083 --> 01:01:15,250
how can he be trusted
with all of humanity?

646
01:01:15,875 --> 01:01:18,458
- My father is willing--
- The Great Curse is coming.

647
01:01:19,916 --> 01:01:22,291
Countless lives will be lost every day.

648
01:01:22,375 --> 01:01:25,625
Yet he called this a blessing.

649
01:01:25,708 --> 01:01:26,833
Tell me.

650
01:01:26,916 --> 01:01:29,375
If you were king, would you do the same?

651
01:01:29,458 --> 01:01:30,291
Shut up.

652
01:01:31,666 --> 01:01:33,750
Return Fengshen Bang to my father!

653
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:10,208
Old man, hand over Fengshen Bang.

654
01:02:11,125 --> 01:02:13,125
Without it, His Majesty will die.

655
01:02:13,958 --> 01:02:15,208
If I give it to him,

656
01:02:16,291 --> 01:02:18,875
I'm afraid the rest of the world
will meet that same fate.

657
01:02:19,708 --> 01:02:20,583
Nonsense.

658
01:02:21,416 --> 01:02:22,791
His Majesty is a hero.

659
01:02:22,875 --> 01:02:25,125
But he takes you all for fools.

660
01:02:27,708 --> 01:02:30,291
He doesn't care about anyone else.

661
01:02:30,875 --> 01:02:32,666
He cares only about himself.

662
01:02:33,458 --> 01:02:34,375
Yin Jiao.

663
01:02:38,291 --> 01:02:39,916
Yin Jiao, he just saved your life.

664
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,041
I don't care.

665
01:02:41,666 --> 01:02:42,958
I need to save my father.

666
01:02:57,541 --> 01:02:58,666
Master Ziya!

667
01:03:03,875 --> 01:03:05,500
Don't hurt him.

668
01:03:17,708 --> 01:03:18,958
Where is my Fengshen Bang?

669
01:03:19,541 --> 01:03:20,541
Release him.

670
01:03:24,291 --> 01:03:25,541
Ji Fa.

671
01:03:25,625 --> 01:03:28,166
- Take it and run.
- Don't do it.

672
01:03:28,250 --> 01:03:30,333
You wouldn't dare.

673
01:03:30,416 --> 01:03:31,791
Don't let go.

674
01:03:31,875 --> 01:03:33,708
Don't do it.

675
01:03:37,458 --> 01:03:38,833
He let go.

676
01:03:38,916 --> 01:03:40,625
Thunderbolts!

677
01:03:46,750 --> 01:03:48,125
He jumped off the cliff.

678
01:04:04,416 --> 01:04:05,541
Yin Jiao.

679
01:04:59,291 --> 01:05:04,291
GOLDEN TURTLE ISLAND

680
01:05:06,375 --> 01:05:07,416
Master.

681
01:05:08,750 --> 01:05:10,791
I have something important
to report to you.

682
01:05:11,291 --> 01:05:12,666
It's Fengshen Bang.

683
01:05:12,750 --> 01:05:15,625
I actually saw Fengshen Bang!

684
01:05:16,208 --> 01:05:19,208
<i>If you saw Fengshen Bang,</i>

685
01:05:19,291 --> 01:05:22,625
<i>why didn't you bring it to me?</i>

686
01:05:22,708 --> 01:05:24,458
Forgive me, Master.

687
01:05:26,416 --> 01:05:28,000
It's not that I didn't try,

688
01:05:28,791 --> 01:05:32,375
but the Kunlun monk had a lot of backup.

689
01:05:33,291 --> 01:05:34,291
I was…

690
01:05:35,500 --> 01:05:37,625
<i>What Kunlun monk?</i>

691
01:05:38,625 --> 01:05:40,625
<i>How dare he bully you?</i>

692
01:05:41,375 --> 01:05:44,000
<i>Master, let's teach them a lesson.</i>

693
01:05:49,083 --> 01:05:50,750
<i>This spell is Soul Instillation.</i>

694
01:05:52,583 --> 01:05:53,958
<i>Master is good to you.</i>

695
01:05:54,958 --> 01:05:56,375
<i>What are you waiting for? Go!</i>

696
01:05:56,958 --> 01:05:59,125
Thank you, Master.

697
01:06:29,125 --> 01:06:29,958
Master Ziya.

698
01:06:31,083 --> 01:06:32,833
You're awake.

699
01:06:32,916 --> 01:06:34,833
Yin Shou is the King of All Realms,

700
01:06:34,916 --> 01:06:36,833
but you won't give Fengshen Bang to him.

701
01:06:37,500 --> 01:06:39,625
What's the point of us staying here?

702
01:06:39,708 --> 01:06:40,541
That's right.

703
01:06:40,625 --> 01:06:43,250
We haven't met anyone nice
since we began on this journey.

704
01:06:43,333 --> 01:06:45,166
You almost lost your life.

705
01:06:46,625 --> 01:06:48,833
Let's take Fengshen Bang back to Kunlun

706
01:06:48,916 --> 01:06:51,000
and leave these mortals
to their own devices.

707
01:06:53,375 --> 01:06:55,208
Yin Jiao is the crown prince.

708
01:06:55,916 --> 01:06:58,333
He's the next King of All Realms.

709
01:07:01,875 --> 01:07:03,833
He's not like his father.

710
01:07:03,916 --> 01:07:05,000
Yin Jiao?

711
01:07:05,083 --> 01:07:06,625
How long will we have to wait

712
01:07:06,708 --> 01:07:08,541
for him to become king?

713
01:07:12,291 --> 01:07:14,125
Who said anything about waiting?

714
01:07:18,625 --> 01:07:21,208
Could it be another demon?

715
01:07:33,583 --> 01:07:34,708
Stop.

716
01:07:52,791 --> 01:07:55,250
Where did this baby come from?

717
01:07:58,166 --> 01:08:00,500
It's so strange. It must be a demon.

718
01:08:02,916 --> 01:08:05,083
My lord, be careful.

719
01:08:32,625 --> 01:08:34,833
You're all alone.

720
01:08:35,416 --> 01:08:37,333
What a pitiful thing.

721
01:08:48,625 --> 01:08:49,500
Sir,

722
01:08:50,958 --> 01:08:53,000
that thing in your arms might be a demon.

723
01:08:54,916 --> 01:08:56,458
We'd better kill it now

724
01:08:58,125 --> 01:08:59,791
before it becomes a threat.

725
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,666
If you can't do it, we will.

726
01:09:05,750 --> 01:09:07,375
It's just a child.

727
01:09:09,583 --> 01:09:11,083
Even if he's a demon,

728
01:09:11,791 --> 01:09:15,291
whether he grows up to be good or evil

729
01:09:15,833 --> 01:09:19,166
depends on how he's raised.

730
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,208
We can't jump to conclusions.

731
01:09:22,291 --> 01:09:24,500
You're absolutely right.

732
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,125
Nezha, Yang Jian, stay your hands.

733
01:09:28,541 --> 01:09:30,375
I'm Jiang Ziya.

734
01:09:30,458 --> 01:09:33,416
We come from Mount Kunlun.

735
01:09:34,916 --> 01:09:37,333
I'm Ji Chang of Xiqi.

736
01:09:39,500 --> 01:09:41,916
Duke of the West. It's an honor.

737
01:09:49,208 --> 01:09:51,000
The child is frail.

738
01:09:51,083 --> 01:09:52,708
To save his life,

739
01:09:53,333 --> 01:09:56,375
I propose we send him to Mount Kunlun

740
01:09:56,458 --> 01:10:00,541
for my master, the Supreme One, to raise.

741
01:10:02,458 --> 01:10:05,333
I've heard a great deal
about the Supreme One.

742
01:10:06,041 --> 01:10:10,583
It would be the child's honor
to be taught by him.

743
01:10:12,375 --> 01:10:15,416
Then you should name the child,

744
01:10:15,958 --> 01:10:17,958
so you'll know him if you meet again.

745
01:10:19,666 --> 01:10:24,583
His birth was accompanied by thunder.

746
01:10:25,583 --> 01:10:28,958
Let's name him Lei Zhenzi.

747
01:10:30,416 --> 01:10:34,333
Yang Jian, Nezha,
take Lei Zhenzi to Kunlun.

748
01:10:34,416 --> 01:10:35,291
Right away.

749
01:10:45,833 --> 01:10:49,250
Strange things keep happening these days.

750
01:10:50,291 --> 01:10:54,416
Is that why you're going to Zhaoge?

751
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:56,416
We have a new king now.

752
01:10:56,500 --> 01:11:00,166
It's customary for the Four Dukes

753
01:11:00,750 --> 01:11:02,958
to pay our respects in person.

754
01:11:03,041 --> 01:11:05,666
So are the other three dukes
also on their way?

755
01:11:05,750 --> 01:11:06,916
Yes.

756
01:11:12,250 --> 01:11:15,583
You asked Ji Chang to summon us

757
01:11:15,666 --> 01:11:17,916
to dethrone Yin Shou

758
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:19,708
and make Yin Jiao the new king.

759
01:11:19,791 --> 01:11:20,958
Exactly.

760
01:11:21,458 --> 01:11:23,083
Yin Shou has promised

761
01:11:23,166 --> 01:11:25,583
to sacrifice himself
to lift the Great Curse.

762
01:11:25,666 --> 01:11:26,666
How foolish.

763
01:11:27,291 --> 01:11:29,208
Do you really believe
he will burn himself?

764
01:11:30,125 --> 01:11:32,000
When the pyre is built,

765
01:11:32,083 --> 01:11:34,083
we will see if he keeps his word.

766
01:11:34,166 --> 01:11:37,083
- How can you--
- There's no time to lose.

767
01:11:37,166 --> 01:11:39,916
The Great Curse has spread to all realms.

768
01:11:40,583 --> 01:11:43,583
There are plagues in the north,

769
01:11:44,625 --> 01:11:47,416
water turning foul in the east,

770
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:51,750
babies stillborn in the south,

771
01:11:52,416 --> 01:11:55,291
and crop failures in the west.

772
01:11:56,166 --> 01:11:59,541
The longer we wait,
the greater the devastation.

773
01:12:00,500 --> 01:12:02,666
This curse was brought on
by the Yin family.

774
01:12:02,750 --> 01:12:04,541
It's their responsibility to end it.

775
01:12:05,166 --> 01:12:07,333
The King of Shang
is the King of All Realms.

776
01:12:07,416 --> 01:12:08,708
The world is his.

777
01:12:08,791 --> 01:12:10,000
This world

778
01:12:10,083 --> 01:12:12,458
isn't the king's world,

779
01:12:12,541 --> 01:12:15,083
but everyone's world.

780
01:12:15,166 --> 01:12:16,583
Fascinating.

781
01:12:18,708 --> 01:12:20,166
Fascinating.

782
01:12:22,250 --> 01:12:26,166
The Duke of the West's divinations
have never been wrong.

783
01:12:27,125 --> 01:12:28,416
So what does it say?

784
01:12:28,500 --> 01:12:32,083
The hexagram indicates deception.

785
01:12:32,666 --> 01:12:36,375
The killing of a king wasn't righteous

786
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:40,375
and a throne fell into undeserving hands.

787
01:12:41,500 --> 01:12:43,291
So it would seem

788
01:12:45,625 --> 01:12:48,500
that the king wasn't killed by Yin Qi,

789
01:12:49,166 --> 01:12:51,958
but someone else.

790
01:12:53,541 --> 01:12:54,958
Who would that be?

791
01:12:55,041 --> 01:12:58,375
Who else but Yin Shou?

792
01:12:58,458 --> 01:13:01,750
It's not right
to jump to such conclusions.

793
01:13:06,166 --> 01:13:08,125
Are you with us or not?

794
01:13:08,208 --> 01:13:09,333
It's treason

795
01:13:12,041 --> 01:13:13,458
with little chance of success.

796
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,458
How about you, Ji Chang?

797
01:13:21,541 --> 01:13:22,875
Don't forget.

798
01:13:24,125 --> 01:13:28,666
Our sons are kept as hostages in Zhaoge.

799
01:13:32,625 --> 01:13:33,916
So be it.

800
01:13:35,583 --> 01:13:36,625
So be it!

801
01:13:37,208 --> 01:13:39,333
I'll return to the south
and rally my troops.

802
01:13:39,416 --> 01:13:42,541
I can do this without you.

803
01:13:44,083 --> 01:13:45,125
Stop!

804
01:13:49,875 --> 01:13:52,958
How dare you plot treason?

805
01:13:53,041 --> 01:13:54,291
He's alone.

806
01:13:54,875 --> 01:13:55,750
Kill him.

807
01:13:56,250 --> 01:13:58,000
No!

808
01:14:00,208 --> 01:14:02,625
It's my son, Ji Fa.

809
01:14:06,125 --> 01:14:08,416
I'm Ji Fa, a guard of the royal court.

810
01:14:09,333 --> 01:14:12,625
I saw Yin Qi kill his father
with my own eyes,

811
01:14:13,416 --> 01:14:15,666
yet you try to smear His Majesty's name

812
01:14:15,750 --> 01:14:17,708
with these false divinations.

813
01:14:18,291 --> 01:14:19,458
Do you see that?

814
01:14:19,541 --> 01:14:21,750
He has been a hostage for so long

815
01:14:21,833 --> 01:14:23,708
that he takes Yin Shou to be his father.

816
01:14:24,541 --> 01:14:26,375
What good is a son like that?

817
01:14:26,958 --> 01:14:27,958
Kill him.

818
01:14:38,833 --> 01:14:40,750
None of you are getting away.

819
01:14:45,666 --> 01:14:47,250
- Ji Fa, we finally found you.
- Men.

820
01:14:47,333 --> 01:14:49,250
We are the royal guards.
Drop your weapons.

821
01:14:49,333 --> 01:14:50,458
Step aside.

822
01:14:58,291 --> 01:15:00,125
They say you can see the future.

823
01:15:00,750 --> 01:15:01,625
Ji Chang,

824
01:15:02,958 --> 01:15:04,458
are you able to see

825
01:15:05,583 --> 01:15:06,666
your own death?

826
01:15:08,333 --> 01:15:10,333
Your Majesty,

827
01:15:11,208 --> 01:15:12,666
a fortune teller

828
01:15:13,166 --> 01:15:17,541
can see the future of everything

829
01:15:18,083 --> 01:15:21,958
except for his own fortunes.

830
01:15:22,041 --> 01:15:23,541
What do you see now?

831
01:15:24,708 --> 01:15:26,500
It shows here

832
01:15:28,083 --> 01:15:29,250
that Your Majesty

833
01:15:30,208 --> 01:15:34,000
will die by the hand
of your own flesh and blood.

834
01:15:43,250 --> 01:15:44,875
Everyone knows

835
01:15:45,708 --> 01:15:47,750
that I intend to sacrifice myself

836
01:15:47,833 --> 01:15:49,583
to save the world.

837
01:15:49,666 --> 01:15:50,708
Ji Chang,

838
01:15:51,791 --> 01:15:53,250
you're nothing but a fake.

839
01:15:54,416 --> 01:15:56,625
Go! Stand before your fathers.

840
01:16:05,875 --> 01:16:07,833
When Yin Qi killed my father,

841
01:16:07,916 --> 01:16:10,166
your sons were all there.

842
01:16:10,250 --> 01:16:11,875
They saw everything that happened.

843
01:16:12,875 --> 01:16:14,500
But the four of you

844
01:16:14,583 --> 01:16:17,041
would believe baseless rumors

845
01:16:17,125 --> 01:16:19,416
over what they saw with their own eyes.

846
01:16:20,458 --> 01:16:21,916
You're not stupid.

847
01:16:22,750 --> 01:16:24,958
You're simply treasonous.

848
01:16:29,500 --> 01:16:32,708
Take a good look at these traitors.

849
01:16:34,500 --> 01:16:36,375
They used to be your fathers.

850
01:16:37,500 --> 01:16:38,458
Now,

851
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,500
they're sinners who betrayed the Shang.

852
01:16:42,125 --> 01:16:43,833
My sister is your wife,

853
01:16:43,916 --> 01:16:45,458
the queen.

854
01:16:45,958 --> 01:16:48,208
The crown prince, Yin Jiao, is my nephew.

855
01:16:48,958 --> 01:16:50,416
Why would I be a traitor?

856
01:16:52,458 --> 01:16:54,083
With the gods as my witnesses,

857
01:16:54,166 --> 01:16:56,208
I never intended to betray you.

858
01:16:56,791 --> 01:16:58,041
Yin Shou!

859
01:17:00,250 --> 01:17:01,833
You killed your father and brother

860
01:17:01,916 --> 01:17:03,375
and brought on the Great Curse.

861
01:17:03,458 --> 01:17:04,333
You…

862
01:17:04,916 --> 01:17:07,333
are the sinner.

863
01:17:11,041 --> 01:17:12,250
Your fathers

864
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,750
kept their favorite sons close to them,

865
01:17:16,875 --> 01:17:18,625
well-fed and well-dressed,

866
01:17:20,291 --> 01:17:21,666
waiting to one day

867
01:17:21,750 --> 01:17:23,291
inherit their thrones.

868
01:17:25,333 --> 01:17:26,958
Whereas you

869
01:17:27,041 --> 01:17:29,583
were abandoned here in distant Zhaoge

870
01:17:30,250 --> 01:17:31,750
to fend for yourselves.

871
01:17:35,333 --> 01:17:36,250
Now,

872
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:39,333
you're all grown up,

873
01:17:40,583 --> 01:17:43,458
trained by my hand
to become Shang warriors.

874
01:17:45,791 --> 01:17:47,333
Your power and courage

875
01:17:47,833 --> 01:17:50,541
have been forged in mortal combat.

876
01:17:52,458 --> 01:17:54,375
No one can tell you what to do.

877
01:17:56,708 --> 01:18:00,250
You are far stronger
than your brothers back home.

878
01:18:00,833 --> 01:18:04,125
You are far more qualified
to succeed your fathers.

879
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:10,625
Now, I give you a chance
to take what is rightfully yours.

880
01:18:12,958 --> 01:18:15,083
Whoever kills his father

881
01:18:18,833 --> 01:18:20,750
can take his place.

882
01:18:27,958 --> 01:18:29,250
Draw your swords!

883
01:18:51,416 --> 01:18:54,416
Have you forgotten how Su Quanxiao died?

884
01:18:58,250 --> 01:19:00,250
<i>Father!</i>

885
01:19:01,208 --> 01:19:03,041
If you don't kill your father,

886
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,541
he will one day kill you.

887
01:19:14,333 --> 01:19:15,541
Father.

888
01:19:37,416 --> 01:19:38,500
Good.

889
01:19:38,583 --> 01:19:39,791
Chong Yingbiao,

890
01:19:39,875 --> 01:19:42,000
you're now Duke of the North.

891
01:19:48,958 --> 01:19:50,083
You fool!

892
01:19:52,833 --> 01:19:54,583
Do it!

893
01:19:58,500 --> 01:19:59,666
No!

894
01:19:59,750 --> 01:20:01,125
No, don't!

895
01:20:02,791 --> 01:20:04,541
My son!

896
01:20:06,583 --> 01:20:07,958
My son!

897
01:20:26,750 --> 01:20:29,708
You must stay alive.

898
01:20:31,625 --> 01:20:32,583
Jiang Wenhuan,

899
01:20:33,375 --> 01:20:35,125
you're now Duke of the East.

900
01:20:36,291 --> 01:20:37,166
Father.

901
01:20:56,916 --> 01:20:59,833
Ji Fa, what are you waiting for?

902
01:21:06,125 --> 01:21:08,166
Do you wish to plead
for your father's life?

903
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:10,916
No.

904
01:21:11,833 --> 01:21:13,166
Ji Chang is a traitor

905
01:21:13,250 --> 01:21:14,875
who deserves to be executed.

906
01:21:14,958 --> 01:21:17,041
The Four Dukes plotted treason

907
01:21:18,125 --> 01:21:19,875
because they were misled by Ji Chang.

908
01:21:20,458 --> 01:21:21,916
Ji Chang is the culprit.

909
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:23,333
He started the conspiracy.

910
01:21:23,416 --> 01:21:24,708
If we kill him,

911
01:21:24,791 --> 01:21:26,791
his sins will be covered up

912
01:21:26,875 --> 01:21:28,375
and no one will know the truth.

913
01:21:32,333 --> 01:21:34,416
He has to apologize in public

914
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,583
to let the people know

915
01:21:38,250 --> 01:21:40,666
that the Four Dukes attempted treason

916
01:21:41,250 --> 01:21:43,541
and it was Your Majesty's decisiveness

917
01:21:43,625 --> 01:21:45,500
that saved the Shang!

918
01:21:52,333 --> 01:21:54,458
You didn't bring Fengshen Bang back.

919
01:21:55,208 --> 01:21:56,333
A failure.

920
01:21:57,166 --> 01:21:59,375
You captured four traitors for the Shang.

921
01:22:00,166 --> 01:22:01,000
A merit.

922
01:22:02,500 --> 01:22:03,416
Guards!

923
01:22:07,166 --> 01:22:09,375
Put Ji Chang in the dungeon.

924
01:22:42,583 --> 01:22:43,500
Father.

925
01:22:47,750 --> 01:22:48,875
Father.

926
01:23:06,166 --> 01:23:07,958
That jade circle

927
01:23:09,916 --> 01:23:14,583
was my gift to you when I sent you here

928
01:23:14,666 --> 01:23:16,833
to be a hostage.

929
01:23:17,541 --> 01:23:20,041
Do you remember what it means?

930
01:23:21,500 --> 01:23:22,583
His Majesty promised me

931
01:23:22,666 --> 01:23:24,208
that if you confessed your crime,

932
01:23:24,291 --> 01:23:25,625
he'd let you return to Xiqi.

933
01:23:26,333 --> 01:23:27,583
The circle

934
01:23:28,916 --> 01:23:31,625
means that one day you will return.

935
01:23:33,916 --> 01:23:35,625
It's planting season soon.

936
01:23:36,458 --> 01:23:40,083
- Xiqi--
- Your false prophecies fomented treason.

937
01:23:41,125 --> 01:23:42,541
Why won't you admit that?

938
01:23:47,458 --> 01:23:48,875
I was wrong.

939
01:23:51,500 --> 01:23:52,833
I shouldn't have

940
01:23:54,166 --> 01:23:55,625
sent you

941
01:23:56,625 --> 01:24:00,125
to live with
such an evil person as Yin Shou.

942
01:24:00,625 --> 01:24:02,333
How can you call him evil?

943
01:24:04,291 --> 01:24:05,791
I saw with my own eyes

944
01:24:05,875 --> 01:24:07,958
how he fought for our kingdom.

945
01:24:08,041 --> 01:24:09,541
I heard with my own ears

946
01:24:09,625 --> 01:24:11,500
how he intends to sacrifice himself

947
01:24:11,583 --> 01:24:13,208
to appease the Great Curse.

948
01:24:14,833 --> 01:24:16,041
As for you,

949
01:24:16,625 --> 01:24:17,875
you were in Xiqi.

950
01:24:18,416 --> 01:24:19,833
You didn't witness any of that,

951
01:24:20,833 --> 01:24:23,250
yet you judge him
based on a handful of sticks.

952
01:24:24,708 --> 01:24:26,291
It's ridiculous.

953
01:24:30,708 --> 01:24:32,250
My son,

954
01:24:33,333 --> 01:24:35,250
what you see

955
01:24:36,375 --> 01:24:41,208
might only be
what Yin Shou wants you to see

956
01:24:42,875 --> 01:24:44,583
and what you believe

957
01:24:45,375 --> 01:24:49,458
might only be
what Yin Shou wants you to believe.

958
01:24:55,125 --> 01:24:56,083
Father.

959
01:25:01,583 --> 01:25:06,208
If you truly believed all that,

960
01:25:07,541 --> 01:25:11,916
you would have killed me
in court yesterday.

961
01:25:17,791 --> 01:25:19,250
I'm your son.

962
01:25:20,416 --> 01:25:21,833
How could I kill you?

963
01:25:28,791 --> 01:25:29,875
Remember.

964
01:25:31,333 --> 01:25:34,500
It doesn't matter whose son you are.

965
01:25:36,250 --> 01:25:37,750
What matters

966
01:25:38,958 --> 01:25:40,916
is who you are.

967
01:26:02,166 --> 01:26:03,666
What a beautiful body.

968
01:26:06,583 --> 01:26:07,791
To kill it

969
01:26:08,791 --> 01:26:10,250
would be a shame, no?

970
01:26:13,291 --> 01:26:14,791
Everything started with you.

971
01:26:15,958 --> 01:26:17,833
Perhaps it should end with you as well.

972
01:26:22,875 --> 01:26:24,000
It seems

973
01:26:25,333 --> 01:26:28,041
that I've awakened a beast.

974
01:26:35,625 --> 01:26:36,750
Keep me around.

975
01:26:39,041 --> 01:26:40,583
I know a way for us

976
01:26:42,500 --> 01:26:47,541
to share immortality.

977
01:26:53,250 --> 01:26:55,166
I ask Your Majesty to execute me.

978
01:26:58,125 --> 01:26:59,458
On what grounds?

979
01:27:00,375 --> 01:27:02,875
The traitor Jiang Huanchu,
Duke of the East,

980
01:27:02,958 --> 01:27:04,541
was executed by Your Majesty.

981
01:27:05,166 --> 01:27:07,500
As his sister,
I deserve the same punishment.

982
01:27:08,833 --> 01:27:10,250
Do you believe he was wronged?

983
01:27:13,333 --> 01:27:15,416
The Four Dukes were loyal men.

984
01:27:16,166 --> 01:27:18,166
By killing them,

985
01:27:18,250 --> 01:27:20,250
you betrayed the trust of your subjects.

986
01:27:20,958 --> 01:27:23,708
Their sons were loving children.

987
01:27:23,791 --> 01:27:25,625
By forcing them to kill their fathers,

988
01:27:25,708 --> 01:27:27,500
you've abandoned all morality.

989
01:27:29,250 --> 01:27:31,666
What you killed was more than four men.

990
01:27:32,791 --> 01:27:34,333
You killed the trust of the world

991
01:27:34,416 --> 01:27:37,250
and the Shang reign of the last 500 years.

992
01:27:38,583 --> 01:27:39,833
As the queen

993
01:27:40,750 --> 01:27:42,083
of this kingdom,

994
01:27:42,833 --> 01:27:45,458
it's my duty to advise the king.

995
01:27:45,541 --> 01:27:47,458
As your wife,

996
01:27:47,541 --> 01:27:50,291
it's my duty to address your sins.

997
01:27:50,958 --> 01:27:53,000
Perhaps my death can serve

998
01:27:53,083 --> 01:27:55,083
to bring you to your senses.

999
01:27:55,166 --> 01:27:57,166
The dead are already gone.

1000
01:27:59,375 --> 01:28:02,125
Why waste your own life?

1001
01:28:08,250 --> 01:28:10,333
A beautiful body such as yours

1002
01:28:11,458 --> 01:28:13,166
isn't easy to come by.

1003
01:28:16,375 --> 01:28:18,291
As the queen,

1004
01:28:20,166 --> 01:28:21,583
you deserve

1005
01:28:22,208 --> 01:28:23,875
to have all the joy in the world.

1006
01:28:33,375 --> 01:28:35,333
Why don't you join us

1007
01:28:36,500 --> 01:28:38,625
in our joy?

1008
01:29:43,333 --> 01:29:45,500
No wonder His Majesty is so fond of you.

1009
01:29:48,583 --> 01:29:49,958
Even I

1010
01:29:51,500 --> 01:29:53,708
can't help feeling drawn to you.

1011
01:30:01,166 --> 01:30:04,208
How strange that a place
as cold and remote as Jizhou

1012
01:30:05,750 --> 01:30:09,500
was able to produce
a stunning beauty like you.

1013
01:30:20,708 --> 01:30:22,291
If I were the king,

1014
01:30:22,375 --> 01:30:25,208
I, too, would fall under your spell.

1015
01:30:28,125 --> 01:30:30,208
Evil temptress,

1016
01:30:30,833 --> 01:30:31,958
begone from this world!

1017
01:31:34,416 --> 01:31:35,458
Demon!

1018
01:32:38,500 --> 01:32:39,375
Father!

1019
01:32:39,458 --> 01:32:42,083
So you do intend to kill me.

1020
01:32:42,166 --> 01:32:43,458
Father.

1021
01:32:46,625 --> 01:32:47,875
She's not human!

1022
01:32:47,958 --> 01:32:49,125
She's a fox demon!

1023
01:32:49,208 --> 01:32:50,375
Protect His Majesty!

1024
01:32:53,708 --> 01:32:55,083
Guards!

1025
01:33:23,833 --> 01:33:24,875
Ji Fa.

1026
01:33:29,333 --> 01:33:30,541
What should I do?

1027
01:33:36,250 --> 01:33:38,291
This leads to outside the Meridian Gate.

1028
01:33:38,375 --> 01:33:40,708
Go to High Priest Bi Gan
and hide for a few days.

1029
01:33:44,875 --> 01:33:45,791
If you let me go,

1030
01:33:46,666 --> 01:33:47,833
what will happen to you?

1031
01:33:49,541 --> 01:33:50,958
Give me Daemon Duke's Sword.

1032
01:34:03,166 --> 01:34:04,000
Ji Fa.

1033
01:34:08,583 --> 01:34:09,541
Chong Yingbiao,

1034
01:34:10,166 --> 01:34:11,125
it's dark in there.

1035
01:34:11,208 --> 01:34:12,500
I'll find a torch for you.

1036
01:34:14,916 --> 01:34:15,833
Bring me

1037
01:34:16,750 --> 01:34:17,666
a torch!

1038
01:34:25,916 --> 01:34:27,458
WANTED
JIANG ZIYA, YANG JIAN, NEZHA

1039
01:34:27,541 --> 01:34:29,333
"The Great Curse is upon us

1040
01:34:29,416 --> 01:34:30,916
and evildoers are everywhere.

1041
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,625
We are in a time of crisis.

1042
01:34:33,708 --> 01:34:35,166
To abate the Great Curse,

1043
01:34:35,250 --> 01:34:36,791
the evildoers must be rooted out.

1044
01:34:36,875 --> 01:34:39,458
This shows His Majesty's
concern for his people.

1045
01:34:39,541 --> 01:34:42,333
The Four Dukes of the East,
West, South, and North

1046
01:34:42,416 --> 01:34:43,958
were ungrateful traitors

1047
01:34:44,041 --> 01:34:45,708
who plotted treason.

1048
01:34:45,791 --> 01:34:47,583
Now that they've failed,

1049
01:34:47,666 --> 01:34:49,333
they are either dead or imprisoned.

1050
01:34:49,416 --> 01:34:50,833
Queen Jiang

1051
01:34:50,916 --> 01:34:52,083
didn't know her place

1052
01:34:52,166 --> 01:34:53,208
and spoke out of turn.

1053
01:34:53,291 --> 01:34:54,625
Ashamed, she drowned herself.

1054
01:34:54,708 --> 01:34:56,541
Kneel before the Duke of The North!

1055
01:34:57,291 --> 01:34:58,666
Crown Prince Yin Jiao,

1056
01:34:58,750 --> 01:35:00,375
utterly lacking in morals,

1057
01:35:00,458 --> 01:35:01,958
crept into the palace at night

1058
01:35:02,041 --> 01:35:03,916
to kill his father and king.

1059
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:05,541
After he failed, he fled

1060
01:35:05,625 --> 01:35:08,333
and is now a wanted man."

1061
01:35:18,875 --> 01:35:21,041
Yin Jiao's Daemon Duke's Sword
is sharp indeed.

1062
01:35:33,208 --> 01:35:34,875
I've had my eyes on you for days now.

1063
01:35:35,708 --> 01:35:37,500
Where are you hiding Yin Jiao?

1064
01:35:39,250 --> 01:35:40,250
At the stable?

1065
01:35:40,791 --> 01:35:42,000
In the barracks?

1066
01:35:43,791 --> 01:35:45,458
Or in a shithole?

1067
01:35:49,250 --> 01:35:50,625
Beast!

1068
01:35:51,500 --> 01:35:52,416
- Hit him.
- Go.

1069
01:35:53,416 --> 01:35:54,833
- Come on. Bring it on
- Kill him!

1070
01:35:55,583 --> 01:35:57,583
- Come on.
- Kill him!

1071
01:35:57,666 --> 01:35:58,750
Kill him!

1072
01:36:00,291 --> 01:36:02,250
- Kill him!
- Harder!

1073
01:36:02,333 --> 01:36:03,333
Kill him!

1074
01:36:05,166 --> 01:36:07,083
- Ji Fa!
- Ji Fa!

1075
01:36:07,708 --> 01:36:10,541
- Get him!
- Get him!

1076
01:36:21,791 --> 01:36:22,666
Yikao.

1077
01:36:27,333 --> 01:36:28,875
All these years alone in Zhaoge,

1078
01:36:28,958 --> 01:36:30,625
I'm sure you've been bullied a lot.

1079
01:36:31,583 --> 01:36:32,541
No way.

1080
01:36:33,041 --> 01:36:34,000
I…

1081
01:36:34,083 --> 01:36:35,541
I do all the bullying.

1082
01:36:35,625 --> 01:36:38,458
You've always been competitive

1083
01:36:38,541 --> 01:36:40,250
and wanted to be a great hero.

1084
01:36:41,041 --> 01:36:43,416
I remember
when the Shang came for hostages

1085
01:36:44,083 --> 01:36:46,250
and Father made us compete in archery

1086
01:36:46,333 --> 01:36:47,750
to see who would go.

1087
01:36:48,333 --> 01:36:49,875
Don't think that I don't know

1088
01:36:49,958 --> 01:36:52,541
that you tampered with my arrow.

1089
01:36:52,625 --> 01:36:55,333
If I hadn't, how could I have beaten you?

1090
01:36:57,250 --> 01:36:58,250
I know

1091
01:36:58,750 --> 01:37:01,208
that you wanted
more than a quiet life in Xiqi.

1092
01:37:01,833 --> 01:37:04,000
You longed to be a warrior in Zhaoge.

1093
01:37:05,291 --> 01:37:07,416
Now that you're a royal guard,

1094
01:37:08,083 --> 01:37:09,666
I'm really happy for you.

1095
01:37:15,500 --> 01:37:16,416
Yikao,

1096
01:37:16,500 --> 01:37:18,791
you're next in line to be Duke of Xiqi.

1097
01:37:18,875 --> 01:37:20,541
You should have stayed there.

1098
01:37:28,250 --> 01:37:30,833
The carriages outside
are loaded with treasure.

1099
01:37:31,416 --> 01:37:32,333
Tell me.

1100
01:37:33,208 --> 01:37:34,541
Is it enough to save Father?

1101
01:37:44,166 --> 01:37:45,958
No amount of treasure will do.

1102
01:37:52,666 --> 01:37:54,416
I've already talked to Father,

1103
01:37:56,416 --> 01:37:58,250
but he won't admit he was wrong.

1104
01:37:59,458 --> 01:38:01,208
That's how Father is.

1105
01:38:03,250 --> 01:38:04,750
He never does anything

1106
01:38:06,666 --> 01:38:07,958
he doesn't believe in.

1107
01:38:10,458 --> 01:38:11,500
Yikao,

1108
01:38:12,875 --> 01:38:13,875
don't worry.

1109
01:38:14,500 --> 01:38:15,458
I'm working on it.

1110
01:38:18,750 --> 01:38:20,041
I'm afraid

1111
01:38:21,625 --> 01:38:23,375
that Father is old and frail.

1112
01:38:24,666 --> 01:38:26,041
He can't wait much longer.

1113
01:38:33,375 --> 01:38:34,583
My Snow Dragon Colts.

1114
01:38:38,166 --> 01:38:39,583
It has been ages.

1115
01:38:40,125 --> 01:38:41,500
They still recognize me.

1116
01:38:44,541 --> 01:38:46,333
You've been away for too long.

1117
01:38:46,416 --> 01:38:48,500
You probably don't know
your way back anymore.

1118
01:38:49,708 --> 01:38:52,708
These two Snow Dragon Colts
were a gift from Father.

1119
01:38:53,458 --> 01:38:55,208
I've trained them over the years.

1120
01:38:56,375 --> 01:38:57,666
They are fast

1121
01:38:58,208 --> 01:38:59,458
and know their way around.

1122
01:40:12,750 --> 01:40:14,541
The treasures you brought

1123
01:40:14,625 --> 01:40:15,958
don't please me.

1124
01:40:17,500 --> 01:40:18,666
However, your presence

1125
01:40:19,250 --> 01:40:20,666
pleases me greatly.

1126
01:40:26,166 --> 01:40:27,250
Tell me.

1127
01:40:28,041 --> 01:40:29,166
What do you want?

1128
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:31,625
Today, I'll grant your every wish.

1129
01:40:52,791 --> 01:40:54,500
My father is too old and weak

1130
01:40:54,583 --> 01:40:56,416
to survive prison.

1131
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:58,500
Would you take pity on him

1132
01:40:58,583 --> 01:40:59,958
and release him?

1133
01:41:00,041 --> 01:41:01,666
Please punish me

1134
01:41:02,333 --> 01:41:03,958
in his place.

1135
01:41:06,416 --> 01:41:08,166
Your father was sentenced to death.

1136
01:41:13,583 --> 01:41:15,291
Then I would die for him.

1137
01:42:10,666 --> 01:42:12,333
Ji Fa, it's me.

1138
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:16,000
Evil monk.

1139
01:42:16,583 --> 01:42:17,750
Every time you show up,

1140
01:42:17,833 --> 01:42:19,208
something bad happens.

1141
01:42:19,916 --> 01:42:21,041
Where is Yin Jiao?

1142
01:42:21,125 --> 01:42:22,083
Take me to see him.

1143
01:42:22,166 --> 01:42:24,000
You won't rest until we're all killed.

1144
01:42:24,083 --> 01:42:25,250
I'm his only hope.

1145
01:42:25,333 --> 01:42:27,125
He can't stay in Zhaoge any longer.

1146
01:42:29,750 --> 01:42:31,458
<i>Last time, you got away,</i>

1147
01:42:31,541 --> 01:42:33,375
but this time, you surrendered yourself.

1148
01:42:33,458 --> 01:42:34,500
Stop talking.

1149
01:42:34,583 --> 01:42:36,041
Come with me.

1150
01:42:37,291 --> 01:42:38,750
Leave Zhaoge.

1151
01:42:38,833 --> 01:42:40,958
Kunlun will protect you.

1152
01:42:41,041 --> 01:42:43,625
You're the future King of All Realms.

1153
01:42:43,708 --> 01:42:46,041
The people's future depends on…

1154
01:42:48,166 --> 01:42:50,291
My father is the King of All Realms.

1155
01:42:50,375 --> 01:42:51,916
He will unseal Fengshen Bang

1156
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:53,375
and save the world!

1157
01:42:54,416 --> 01:42:55,875
I told you, old man.

1158
01:42:56,500 --> 01:42:58,041
He won't listen to you.

1159
01:42:58,125 --> 01:42:59,541
Do you still believe him?

1160
01:42:59,625 --> 01:43:01,708
My Father is bewitched by a fox demon.

1161
01:43:02,666 --> 01:43:04,666
Good and bad fortunes

1162
01:43:05,666 --> 01:43:07,416
don't happen by accident.

1163
01:43:08,666 --> 01:43:10,416
Those with evil intentions

1164
01:43:11,166 --> 01:43:13,250
attract demons.

1165
01:43:14,500 --> 01:43:15,916
Why don't you think about it?

1166
01:43:16,458 --> 01:43:21,958
What if your father
isn't bewitched by a fox demon?

1167
01:43:26,291 --> 01:43:27,875
If we can lure Daji to this place

1168
01:43:27,958 --> 01:43:29,291
and kill the fox demon,

1169
01:43:29,375 --> 01:43:31,708
then we will know the truth.

1170
01:43:39,791 --> 01:43:40,708
<i>It pains me</i>

1171
01:43:41,291 --> 01:43:42,583
to see how you've suffered.

1172
01:43:45,833 --> 01:43:47,791
Are you here to kill me?

1173
01:44:01,791 --> 01:44:03,125
I envy you

1174
01:44:04,041 --> 01:44:05,916
for having two good sons.

1175
01:44:07,125 --> 01:44:08,250
I, on the other hand,

1176
01:44:08,916 --> 01:44:10,416
only have one,

1177
01:44:11,208 --> 01:44:12,708
who wants to kill me.

1178
01:44:14,541 --> 01:44:16,041
We're both fathers.

1179
01:44:17,208 --> 01:44:18,708
Why am I so afflicted?

1180
01:44:20,708 --> 01:44:23,875
However you treat your own father,

1181
01:44:25,041 --> 01:44:29,833
your son will follow that example.

1182
01:44:30,625 --> 01:44:32,041
But you have no idea

1183
01:44:32,583 --> 01:44:34,416
how my father treated me.

1184
01:44:48,875 --> 01:44:50,458
I have great admiration for you.

1185
01:44:51,833 --> 01:44:53,375
What should I do?

1186
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:55,666
I would like to hear your advice.

1187
01:44:58,583 --> 01:45:01,208
If you keep your word

1188
01:45:02,125 --> 01:45:03,833
and sacrifice yourself,

1189
01:45:04,416 --> 01:45:05,958
your sins

1190
01:45:06,875 --> 01:45:08,750
will be absolved

1191
01:45:10,625 --> 01:45:15,333
and you will still be
an honorable descendant of Cheng Tang.

1192
01:45:16,916 --> 01:45:18,458
The thing is,

1193
01:45:19,333 --> 01:45:21,458
can you do it?

1194
01:45:33,583 --> 01:45:36,583
Did Bo Yikao come to Zhaoge?

1195
01:45:38,125 --> 01:45:39,250
Where is he?

1196
01:45:43,958 --> 01:45:45,916
You love your son so much.

1197
01:45:47,041 --> 01:45:50,833
Don't you recognize how he tastes?

1198
01:45:57,666 --> 01:45:59,666
Even beasts don't eat their cubs.

1199
01:46:01,541 --> 01:46:03,416
You're worse than an animal.

1200
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:17,583
Do you want a bite?

1201
01:46:20,916 --> 01:46:22,791
Have a bite.

1202
01:46:24,291 --> 01:46:25,916
Take it!

1203
01:46:28,708 --> 01:46:30,333
Take it!

1204
01:46:31,875 --> 01:46:34,250
You monster!

1205
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:36,708
Kill me!

1206
01:46:37,375 --> 01:46:38,916
Kill me!

1207
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:40,333
I promised Bo Yikao

1208
01:46:40,916 --> 01:46:42,250
that I wouldn't kill you

1209
01:46:42,875 --> 01:46:44,000
and would release you.

1210
01:46:45,416 --> 01:46:47,125
You know what you have to do.

1211
01:46:55,500 --> 01:46:56,583
Remember.

1212
01:46:57,583 --> 01:47:00,375
I still have your other son in my hands.

1213
01:47:50,291 --> 01:47:52,333
I have sinned.

1214
01:47:54,083 --> 01:47:57,083
I made a false divination.

1215
01:47:57,875 --> 01:48:01,125
I plotted treason.

1216
01:48:01,916 --> 01:48:04,833
I instigated a revolt.

1217
01:48:06,458 --> 01:48:08,666
I'm a criminal.

1218
01:48:09,541 --> 01:48:11,958
I'm unforgivable.

1219
01:48:14,125 --> 01:48:16,458
I have sinned!

1220
01:48:17,500 --> 01:48:20,291
I made a false divination!

1221
01:48:20,958 --> 01:48:24,500
I plotted treason!

1222
01:48:25,166 --> 01:48:26,250
I…

1223
01:48:27,666 --> 01:48:31,250
I instigated a revolt!

1224
01:48:34,500 --> 01:48:37,791
I made a false divination.

1225
01:48:38,833 --> 01:48:42,416
I plotted treason.

1226
01:48:44,416 --> 01:48:45,500
I…

1227
01:48:46,833 --> 01:48:48,541
instigated a revolt.

1228
01:48:50,333 --> 01:48:51,791
I'm a criminal.

1229
01:48:58,791 --> 01:49:00,375
I'm a criminal.

1230
01:49:02,666 --> 01:49:03,500
I…

1231
01:49:04,375 --> 01:49:06,208
I made a false divination.

1232
01:49:18,958 --> 01:49:20,875
I, Yin Shou,

1233
01:49:20,958 --> 01:49:23,875
have brought Lady Su to meet our ancestors

1234
01:49:25,041 --> 01:49:27,500
and ask for their blessing.

1235
01:49:36,666 --> 01:49:38,208
Come closer.

1236
01:49:38,916 --> 01:49:42,000
Let the ancestors see you.

1237
01:49:58,250 --> 01:50:01,500
If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes,

1238
01:50:02,166 --> 01:50:04,041
I would never believe

1239
01:50:04,125 --> 01:50:06,291
that such beauty could exist.

1240
01:50:07,500 --> 01:50:08,916
Give me your hand.

1241
01:50:18,166 --> 01:50:19,333
Fox demon,

1242
01:50:19,416 --> 01:50:22,500
I've locked your meridian pathway.

1243
01:50:22,583 --> 01:50:24,541
Prepare to die!

1244
01:50:24,625 --> 01:50:27,125
How can you say she is a fox demon?

1245
01:50:28,166 --> 01:50:29,333
Yin Jiao.

1246
01:50:35,625 --> 01:50:38,875
So this is where you've been hiding.

1247
01:50:44,416 --> 01:50:46,083
I saw with my own eyes

1248
01:50:46,833 --> 01:50:48,833
how the fox demon inhabits Su Daji's body.

1249
01:50:49,708 --> 01:50:51,625
Father, I wounded you by accident

1250
01:50:51,708 --> 01:50:53,791
when I was trying to kill this demon

1251
01:50:54,333 --> 01:50:55,833
and avenge Mother.

1252
01:50:56,500 --> 01:50:58,416
Daji has been with me all this time.

1253
01:50:58,916 --> 01:51:00,916
If she were a fox demon, I would know.

1254
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:01,916
When I kill her,

1255
01:51:02,416 --> 01:51:05,208
her true form will reveal itself.

1256
01:51:06,208 --> 01:51:07,958
What if she isn't a fox demon?

1257
01:51:08,041 --> 01:51:09,541
You will have taken an innocent life.

1258
01:51:13,875 --> 01:51:16,458
As the High Priest,

1259
01:51:17,041 --> 01:51:20,291
I have a magical heart
with seven chambers.

1260
01:51:21,333 --> 01:51:23,125
Upon consuming this heart,

1261
01:51:23,208 --> 01:51:24,333
any demon

1262
01:51:24,916 --> 01:51:28,458
will revert to its original form.

1263
01:51:28,958 --> 01:51:31,916
You would give up your heart for this?

1264
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:34,000
What is my heart

1265
01:51:34,083 --> 01:51:35,791
compared to the royal family

1266
01:51:36,625 --> 01:51:39,583
and our dynasty?

1267
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:49,708
But if Su Daji is indeed a fox demon,

1268
01:51:49,791 --> 01:51:52,208
what will Your Majesty do?

1269
01:51:55,583 --> 01:51:56,708
Name your terms.

1270
01:51:57,791 --> 01:51:59,208
She must be put to death.

1271
01:52:00,500 --> 01:52:02,958
Yin Jiao must be pardoned

1272
01:52:03,541 --> 01:52:05,916
and the Four Dukes
must be declared innocent.

1273
01:52:06,958 --> 01:52:08,958
In the name of our ancestors,

1274
01:52:09,500 --> 01:52:12,791
swear to do all this.

1275
01:52:17,541 --> 01:52:19,916
As the ancestors are my witnesses,

1276
01:52:20,916 --> 01:52:22,166
I swear it.

1277
01:52:23,875 --> 01:52:25,500
Granduncle, you mustn't!

1278
01:52:44,958 --> 01:52:45,875
Swallow it.

1279
01:53:27,041 --> 01:53:29,041
Fox demon, you won't harm His Majesty!

1280
01:53:32,625 --> 01:53:34,083
The fox demon has shown itself.

1281
01:53:34,166 --> 01:53:37,000
Now, Your Majesty, kill it.

1282
01:53:41,041 --> 01:53:43,208
Do it in the name of our ancestors.

1283
01:53:43,291 --> 01:53:44,250
Yin Shou,

1284
01:53:44,333 --> 01:53:46,958
what are you waiting for?

1285
01:53:49,583 --> 01:53:50,541
Our ancestors?

1286
01:53:55,791 --> 01:53:57,083
Where are these ancestors?

1287
01:54:01,125 --> 01:54:03,416
If I call out to them, do they answer?

1288
01:54:05,500 --> 01:54:07,458
You all say the white fox is a demon.

1289
01:54:09,583 --> 01:54:11,416
In fact, she's a charm.

1290
01:54:14,291 --> 01:54:17,250
Only she knows what I truly desire.

1291
01:54:18,791 --> 01:54:19,916
<i>You want</i>

1292
01:54:21,083 --> 01:54:27,333
<i>to be the king of the whole world.</i>

1293
01:54:38,916 --> 01:54:40,083
The Shang dynasty

1294
01:54:40,625 --> 01:54:42,083
is finished.

1295
01:54:45,541 --> 01:54:46,375
High Priest.

1296
01:54:46,458 --> 01:54:47,625
The Shang dynasty

1297
01:54:48,625 --> 01:54:51,333
is truly finished.

1298
01:54:58,166 --> 01:54:59,333
Granduncle!

1299
01:55:01,291 --> 01:55:02,166
The Shang dynasty…

1300
01:55:05,583 --> 01:55:06,500
High Priest.

1301
01:55:06,583 --> 01:55:08,458
Get the High Priest out of here. Quickly.

1302
01:55:25,416 --> 01:55:26,708
Treacherous son,

1303
01:55:28,083 --> 01:55:29,458
what do you find so amusing?

1304
01:55:32,416 --> 01:55:34,833
I thought you were bewitched
by the fox demon.

1305
01:55:36,541 --> 01:55:39,333
That's why I kept hoping that

1306
01:55:39,916 --> 01:55:42,416
you would turn back into the father

1307
01:55:43,083 --> 01:55:45,833
that I respected and looked up to!

1308
01:55:45,916 --> 01:55:48,166
I was such a fool!

1309
01:55:50,333 --> 01:55:52,708
You did this!

1310
01:55:58,041 --> 01:55:59,708
You gave me my life.

1311
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:03,625
Now you can take it back!

1312
01:56:06,458 --> 01:56:07,583
Yin Jiao!

1313
01:56:21,125 --> 01:56:22,083
Guards!

1314
01:56:26,166 --> 01:56:27,125
Take him away.

1315
01:56:27,208 --> 01:56:28,291
- Yes.
- Yes.

1316
01:56:36,583 --> 01:56:38,375
He'll be executed tomorrow.

1317
01:56:47,583 --> 01:56:49,791
Don't think I don't know
what you've been up to.

1318
01:56:49,875 --> 01:56:51,083
I would never.

1319
01:57:04,291 --> 01:57:05,458
Of all the hostages,

1320
01:57:07,250 --> 01:57:08,875
you were my favorite

1321
01:57:10,500 --> 01:57:12,708
because on the day you arrived in Zhaoge,

1322
01:57:13,291 --> 01:57:14,333
you told me

1323
01:57:15,041 --> 01:57:17,125
that you wanted to be a hero.

1324
01:57:19,250 --> 01:57:21,625
We are alike.

1325
01:57:22,625 --> 01:57:23,708
Therefore,

1326
01:57:25,208 --> 01:57:27,125
I'll give you one last chance.

1327
01:57:28,166 --> 01:57:29,708
Go and kill Ji Chang.

1328
01:57:32,833 --> 01:57:33,791
<i>Do that for me</i>

1329
01:57:35,333 --> 01:57:38,375
<i>and you'll become my son and heir,</i>

1330
01:57:39,125 --> 01:57:41,333
<i>the crown prince of Shang.</i>

1331
01:57:42,708 --> 01:57:44,833
<i>Don't disappoint me again.</i>

1332
01:57:52,708 --> 01:57:54,416
I'm a criminal.

1333
01:57:56,125 --> 01:57:59,458
I'm unforgivable.

1334
01:58:02,041 --> 01:58:03,875
I have sinned.

1335
01:58:23,083 --> 01:58:26,208
I thought I would never again
see the light of day,

1336
01:58:27,125 --> 01:58:28,750
<i>but you saved me.</i>

1337
01:58:29,833 --> 01:58:31,250
<i>I practiced for 1,000 years</i>

1338
01:58:32,250 --> 01:58:34,250
<i>to take on a human form</i>

1339
01:58:34,333 --> 01:58:36,291
<i>and partake in the pleasures of life.</i>

1340
01:58:38,791 --> 01:58:42,291
<i>However, King Cheng Tang
sealed me inside Xuanyuan Tomb.</i>

1341
01:58:44,083 --> 01:58:45,458
<i>It has been 500 years.</i>

1342
01:58:47,541 --> 01:58:49,541
<i>Only the blood of his descendants</i>

1343
01:58:49,625 --> 01:58:51,166
<i>could break the seal.</i>

1344
01:58:52,500 --> 01:58:56,000
<i>You brought me back to life.</i>

1345
01:58:59,791 --> 01:59:01,250
<i>In return,</i>

1346
01:59:02,500 --> 01:59:05,083
<i>I used a soul transference spell</i>

1347
01:59:05,166 --> 01:59:07,416
<i>to inhabit Yin Qi's body</i>

1348
01:59:08,208 --> 01:59:10,208
<i>to help you do what you want to do</i>

1349
01:59:11,083 --> 01:59:13,541
<i>and help you take what you want to have.</i>

1350
01:59:17,708 --> 01:59:19,541
I'll make you immortal,

1351
01:59:21,291 --> 01:59:23,083
a king for all eternity.

1352
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:42,125
A subject serves his king

1353
01:59:42,208 --> 01:59:43,791
like the sun and moon in the sky.

1354
01:59:45,166 --> 01:59:47,958
Such is the basis of a nation.

1355
01:59:49,375 --> 01:59:51,583
A son serves his father

1356
01:59:51,666 --> 01:59:53,541
like the gods in the heavens above.

1357
01:59:53,625 --> 01:59:56,291
Such is the foundation of a family.

1358
01:59:57,333 --> 02:00:00,750
That's why there's no greater sin

1359
02:00:00,833 --> 02:00:03,875
than the murder of one's father and king.

1360
02:00:03,958 --> 02:00:05,291
The traitorous son, Yin Jiao,

1361
02:00:05,375 --> 02:00:07,333
disregarding all law and ethics,

1362
02:00:07,416 --> 02:00:09,125
was armed with murderous intent.

1363
02:00:09,208 --> 02:00:11,416
- "…intending to commit injustice
- Ji Chang,

1364
02:00:11,500 --> 02:00:13,041
- and seizing the throne.
- which one of us was fated to die

1365
02:00:13,125 --> 02:00:15,541
- Fortunately, with the protection of…"
- by the hand of his own flesh and blood?

1366
02:00:15,625 --> 02:00:17,666
Yin Shou!

1367
02:00:19,208 --> 02:00:22,541
Dead or alive, I'm coming for you!

1368
02:00:23,041 --> 02:00:24,333
Proceed with the execution.

1369
02:00:27,708 --> 02:00:29,000
Is it for real?

1370
02:00:36,416 --> 02:00:38,875
Nezha and Yang Jian, where are you?

1371
02:00:51,833 --> 02:00:52,666
Men of Xiqi,

1372
02:00:53,500 --> 02:00:54,916
save Yin Jiao!

1373
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:56,458
Attack!

1374
02:01:05,333 --> 02:01:06,166
Stop them!

1375
02:01:11,708 --> 02:01:13,875
You dared to deceive me!

1376
02:01:15,583 --> 02:01:18,250
Release Yin Jiao or I'll kill you.

1377
02:01:20,583 --> 02:01:22,125
You don't have what it takes.

1378
02:01:24,416 --> 02:01:25,458
Execute him!

1379
02:01:34,583 --> 02:01:35,625
Buddy,

1380
02:01:35,708 --> 02:01:37,250
let me send you on your way.

1381
02:02:09,375 --> 02:02:11,166
Do you want to kill me?

1382
02:02:12,375 --> 02:02:13,625
Don't forget.

1383
02:02:14,250 --> 02:02:16,500
I taught you everything you know.

1384
02:02:16,583 --> 02:02:18,250
Save Ji Fa!

1385
02:02:36,333 --> 02:02:38,291
Nezha, Yang Jian. I'm here!

1386
02:02:40,125 --> 02:02:41,333
Master Ziya!

1387
02:02:42,291 --> 02:02:43,916
Come with us!

1388
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:46,583
Don't worry about me.
Take Yin Jiao with you!

1389
02:02:46,666 --> 02:02:48,958
Yin Jiao is in two sections. He's dead!

1390
02:02:49,041 --> 02:02:49,916
Stop wasting time!

1391
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:52,208
Take him to Kunlun immediately!

1392
02:03:10,166 --> 02:03:11,125
Water Teleportation!

1393
02:03:19,041 --> 02:03:20,041
Did they both leave?

1394
02:03:56,833 --> 02:03:58,083
If the gods won't kill you,

1395
02:03:58,625 --> 02:03:59,708
I will.

1396
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:29,666
The king is dead!

1397
02:04:30,541 --> 02:04:34,375
I, Duke of the North, give the orders now!

1398
02:04:55,208 --> 02:04:57,541
Bring me Ji Fa!

1399
02:04:58,041 --> 02:04:59,208
Yes.

1400
02:05:11,875 --> 02:05:13,250
Why are you still in Zhaoge?

1401
02:05:13,333 --> 02:05:14,625
You must have a death wish!

1402
02:05:25,583 --> 02:05:27,916
Soul Instillation.

1403
02:06:04,166 --> 02:06:05,541
Yin Shou is dead!

1404
02:06:05,625 --> 02:06:07,125
I killed him!

1405
02:06:09,333 --> 02:06:12,041
He was the one
responsible for the Great Curse!

1406
02:06:12,541 --> 02:06:14,041
Stop them!

1407
02:06:21,875 --> 02:06:22,708
Jiang Wenhuan,

1408
02:06:23,291 --> 02:06:24,833
if you wish to avenge him,

1409
02:06:26,541 --> 02:06:27,541
do it now.

1410
02:06:55,416 --> 02:06:56,458
Stand down!

1411
02:06:58,708 --> 02:06:59,708
Let them go.

1412
02:07:05,958 --> 02:07:07,083
Let's go!

1413
02:07:17,833 --> 02:07:19,125
Close the gates!

1414
02:07:19,208 --> 02:07:20,416
Prepare for battle!

1415
02:07:26,125 --> 02:07:28,500
SHANG

1416
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:47,041
Someone is coming!

1417
02:07:47,125 --> 02:07:48,083
Stop him!

1418
02:07:48,166 --> 02:07:49,916
MENGJIN FORD,
BORDER OF SHANG AND ZHOU

1419
02:07:53,416 --> 02:07:54,416
Stop him now!

1420
02:08:01,416 --> 02:08:02,250
It's a fugitive.

1421
02:08:23,333 --> 02:08:24,625
Go into the forest!

1422
02:08:26,250 --> 02:08:28,041
Come on! Keep up!

1423
02:08:35,750 --> 02:08:36,833
What is this?

1424
02:09:06,375 --> 02:09:07,375
Release the arrows!

1425
02:09:18,750 --> 02:09:20,791
Ji Fa, go. Save yourself.

1426
02:09:20,875 --> 02:09:22,708
It's me that they're after.

1427
02:09:24,333 --> 02:09:26,000
I need to borrow something from you.

1428
02:09:26,083 --> 02:09:27,000
What?

1429
02:10:54,333 --> 02:10:57,500
Not so fast, Taoist friend.

1430
02:11:06,583 --> 02:11:07,833
Why is it you?

1431
02:12:31,375 --> 02:12:35,000
Jiang Ziya, you won't get away!

1432
02:13:00,375 --> 02:13:01,791
Who are you?

1433
02:13:13,375 --> 02:13:14,958
Lei Zhenzi.

1434
02:13:15,041 --> 02:13:17,500
LEI ZHENZI

1435
02:13:23,125 --> 02:13:24,333
My child,

1436
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:27,708
let's go home.

1437
02:13:34,333 --> 02:13:38,833
XIQI

1438
02:14:12,125 --> 02:14:15,583
<i>These two Snow Dragon Colts
were a gift from Father.</i>

1439
02:14:16,083 --> 02:14:18,083
<i>I've trained them over the years.</i>

1440
02:14:18,791 --> 02:14:20,875
Whenever you want to return,

1441
02:14:20,958 --> 02:14:23,041
just say to them,

1442
02:14:23,125 --> 02:14:24,166
“Go home."

1443
02:14:24,916 --> 02:14:26,583
And they'll take you back to Xiqi.

1444
02:14:36,375 --> 02:14:37,708
The circle.

1445
02:14:42,208 --> 02:14:43,125
Father.

1446
02:14:44,416 --> 02:14:46,125
I promise I'll return home to Xiqi.

1447
02:14:53,875 --> 02:14:54,875
Circle.

1448
02:15:00,666 --> 02:15:02,250
Full circle.

1449
02:15:15,541 --> 02:15:16,416
Go home.

1450
02:15:58,083 --> 02:15:59,416
It's a Snow Dragon Colt.

1451
02:15:59,500 --> 02:16:01,500
The young master is back!

1452
02:16:17,833 --> 02:16:18,833
Father.

1453
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:45,958
Come.

1454
02:16:57,166 --> 02:16:58,416
Full circle.

1455
02:17:07,708 --> 02:17:08,625
Father.

1456
02:17:12,916 --> 02:17:14,083
I'm back.

1457
02:20:39,125 --> 02:20:42,083
ALL ANIMALS INVOLVED
IN THE MAKING OF THIS FILM

1458
02:20:42,166 --> 02:20:44,916
WERE TRAINED
BY PROFESSIONALS

1459
02:20:45,000 --> 02:20:48,875
AND NO ANIMALS WERE HARMED
DURING THE FILMING PROCESS

DEEP IN MOUNT QI

1461
02:24:47,791 --> 02:24:50,541
Wen Zhong, Grand Preceptor of Shang,

1462
02:24:50,625 --> 02:24:55,375
after ten years of battle
near the North Sea,

1463
02:24:56,666 --> 02:25:00,500
has returned in victory!
