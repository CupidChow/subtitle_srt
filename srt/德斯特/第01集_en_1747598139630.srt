1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I appreciate your time and understand that this is an unusual situation.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:15,000
But growing up as I did in Baltimore looking like I do, being who I am, there weren't many handouts, sir.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
If an opportunity came your way, it was because you fought for it.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:28,000
When I hear no or you can't or that's not possible, well, uh, sirs,

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
the first thing I do is look for another way to do it, to get it, to be it.

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Miss Hayes, we understand, but we don't do this.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I've never heard of a graduate requesting placement. That doesn't happen.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
We don't take requests. We're the FBI, not an FM radio station.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Lecture in February, you said that an agent is defined by challenge.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Graduation was coming fast, so I started looking for tough cases and found one in Phoenix.

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I may be overstepping by requesting it, but I also remember you saying that the best agents don't always follow the rules.

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
You say that?

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I might have.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Miss Hayes, you applied to the academy how many times?

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Three times, sir.

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
And do you know why you were finally accepted?

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Because there are times of charm.

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Because Hoover hated the Negro. Yet he wanted more of you in here to help infiltrate the radicals.

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Well, he's dead now, sir.

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Which is our problem. We don't know what to do with you.

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
We tried to assign you to every office, but they all turned you down. No one's clamoring for an agent like you.

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
But...

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
We're down a man in Phoenix, of all places.

24
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Be careful what you wish for.

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:48,000
We assigned you to Phoenix. It won't be because you requested it. It'll be because we have no other options here. That clear?

26
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Yes. Yes, sir.

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
You want the Saxton case, Agent Hayes? It's yours.

28
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Right on.

29
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Right on!

30
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I'm sorry, sir.

31
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Where we going?

32
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Nachos con Dios. The one in Ripley.

33
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Oh, come on now, fucking Ripley.

34
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Order 24 sloppy osseys, give him the cash, get what you came for, haul ass, and be back by four o'clock or he's dead.

35
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Saxton's counting on you.

36
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Fuck.

37
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
No, no, no. Uncle did. He said fuck.

38
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Hey, just because I said it doesn't mean you can.

39
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Your mama would kill me if she heard you use some language like that.

40
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
She won't know.

41
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
You still counting?

42
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Recounting. Look like Mama's telling me.

43
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Uncle Jim, look what I found. A lucky one.

44
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
What, pandas are lucky?

45
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Yeah, pandas are lucky. The luckiest band...

46
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Fuck!

47
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Hey!

48
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Got it.

49
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Welcome to Nachos con Dios.

50
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Yeah, I'll take 24 sloppy osseys.

51
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Do you have the...

52
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Oh.

53
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Okay.

54
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Do you smell that? Are those cinnamon chips?

55
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
No, no.

56
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Uh, excuse me, sir. Are those cinnamon chips?

57
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Sure are, Miss Luna. Fresh baked.

58
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Would you like some?

59
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Ask the man what you should kindness.

60
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
May I please have some of those chips, sir?

61
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Coming right up.

62
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Fucking Jim Ellis.

63
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
So how come you won't tell me what's in that bag?

64
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Those peanuts. Little mysteries make life worth living.

65
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Hey, Uncle Jim?

66
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Yeah, I see him.

67
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
You were warning us to come back, asshole!

68
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Oh, hey there, Gavin!

69
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
You're a dead man, Ellis!

70
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Put your seatbelt on.

71
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Hey, how about you not threaten me? I got my niece in here.

72
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
How about fuck you?

73
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Oh, my God!

74
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Fuck!

75
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
They're still behind us.

76
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Not for long.

77
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
You're a piece of shit!

78
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Hold on!

79
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I'll take care of you!

80
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Yeah!

81
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Whoo!

82
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Nice one, Uncle Jim.

83
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Ha-ha-ha!

84
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
This is for you, little brother.

85
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Wow!

86
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Jim.

87
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
He's dead.

88
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Are you serious?

89
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
No, I'm fucking with you.

90
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Get in here, hurry up.

91
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Asshole.

92
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Package is here, Doctor.

93
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Sternol salt.

94
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Bring it over here, please.

95
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Stitch for the ear.

96
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Over here, please. We gotta go.

97
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
One heifer?

98
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Yes, go ahead.

99
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
What dose?

100
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
30K.

101
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Unzip.

102
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Give me a 4-0.

103
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Pannulating SBC.

104
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Cross clamp.

105
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Low is good.

106
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Low is fine.

107
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Great color.

108
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Ha!

109
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
You got no blood pressure.

110
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Shift that machine up.

111
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I need to check your juice flow on bypass.

112
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I'm taking the clamp off.

113
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Do it compress.

114
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Ah, damn it!

115
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Trink scrub.

116
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
It's a small branch.

117
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I'll clip it.

118
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I need that machine up.

119
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
We have to do everything on gas.

120
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Shit!

121
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Mandually pump now.

122
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Hey, you.

123
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Glove up quick.

124
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Right hand over there.

125
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Machine's coming back up.

126
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Give me two minutes to get full flow.

127
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
See what I'm doing.

128
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Pump his heart like this.

129
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
All right.

130
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Keep doing compressions.

131
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I need to prepare the new heart.

132
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
It's a fucking day.

133
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I'm going to get the new heart.

134
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I'm going to get the new heart.

135
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I'm going to get the new heart.

136
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I'm going to get the new heart.

137
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I'm going to get the new heart.

138
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I'm going to get the new heart.

139
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I'm going to get the new heart.

140
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I'm going to get the new heart.

141
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I'm going to get the new heart.

142
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I'm going to get the new heart.

143
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I'm going to get the new heart.

144
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I'm going to get the new heart.

145
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I'm going to get the new heart.

146
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I'm going to get the new heart.

147
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I'm going to get the new heart.

148
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Any signs of that Spitfire near Zipper Yellow Jacket?

149
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I'm still 10-10 on the side.

150
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Come back.

151
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,800
Take it to her, sweet stuff.

152
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,300
But I'll keep my eye peeled.

153
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:01,300
I'll be right back.

154
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:03,300
This man just wanted me to wake up.

155
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,300
They're here, though. We'll meet him.

156
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:09,300
Hey, sweetie, you good?

157
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,800
Hey, Mommy.

158
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,300
Yeah, I have fun.

159
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,300
We always do.

160
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:16,300
Okay.

161
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:17,300
Thanks, Uncle Jim.

162
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:19,300
See you later, Peanut.

163
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:24,300
You were supposed to be here two hours ago.

164
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,600
Yeah, well, something came up.

165
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,600
This is what I'm talking about.

166
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,600
I can't rely on you.

167
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,600
This is why she can't know.

168
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,600
You heard her call me out,

169
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,600
but she don't know.

170
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,600
Listen, I gotta run.

171
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,600
You need to get responsible, Jim.

172
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,600
I'm trying to take this.

173
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,600
Lay off a couple of longhounds.

174
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,600
It's blood money.

175
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:46,600
Do what we got.

176
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,600
You look good, here.

177
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,900
I'm coming

178
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,900
I'm coming, baby

179
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,900
I'm coming

180
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,900
Come and come, help me

181
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,900
Make your baby understand

182
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,900
I'm born to love you

183
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,900
Don't born to make you hard

184
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:04,900
Like a bitch and get ready

185
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,900
And give yourself a brand new start

186
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,900
I said I'm coming

187
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,900
I'm coming, baby

188
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,900
I'm coming

189
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,900
Help me, baby

190
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,900
I'm getting ready

191
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,200
I'm coming, baby

192
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,200
Agent Fitzsue.

193
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,200
Uh, yes?

194
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,200
I'm Agent Hayes.

195
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,200
You're a...

196
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,200
Black, yes, I'm black.

197
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,200
No, that's not what I was...

198
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,200
I get it all the time.

199
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,200
Oh, yeah, me too.

200
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,200
Not black, obviously.

201
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,200
I'm Navajo.

202
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,200
Well, part Navajo.

203
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,200
But everyone thinks I'm Mexican.

204
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,200
My first name's Awan.

205
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,200
A-W-A-N.

206
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,200
But people think it's A-J-U-A-N.

207
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,200
Like, just another Juan.

208
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,200
Are you always this chatty?

209
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,200
I like to connect verbally.

210
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,200
Let's connect with the field office.

211
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,200
I'm coming.

212
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,200
Oh, good God, look at this.

213
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,200
Dawn of a new era.

214
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,700
Nathan Abbott, squad supervisor.

215
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,700
Nina Hayes, happy to be here.

216
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,200
Nicol Tour, come on.

217
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,200
All right, violent crime squad's in the back.

218
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:19,200
That corner office, that's A.S.A.C. Braddock's office.

219
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,200
He's in D.C. on a policy compad.

220
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,200
He'll be back the end of next week.

221
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,200
This is Jessica Lorraine.

222
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,200
He's our girl Friday.

223
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,200
He's the secretary of pool humming.

224
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,200
Agent Hayes.

225
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,200
Jessica Lorraine, it's good to meet you.

226
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,200
Welcome to the loveliest field office

227
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,200
this side of the Mississippi.

228
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,200
She makes a mean cup of sangha.

229
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,200
Far out, thanks.

230
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,200
All right.

231
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,200
Bank robbery and white collar boys

232
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,200
are over by the window.

233
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:41,200
Public corruption's over there.

234
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,200
You a bit sooner...

235
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,200
It's up.

236
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,200
Mod squad incoming.

237
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,200
The rest of the syndicate team's right up here.

238
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:49,200
This is Agent Chad Grant, senior agent on the team.

239
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,200
Agent Henry Minor, Agent Nina Hayes, fresh out of Quantico.

240
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,200
There she is.

241
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,200
The rookie who thinks she can take down

242
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,200
the Southwest Al Capone.

243
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,200
Black and a woman.

244
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,200
Fantastic.

245
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,200
Oh, well, I'll tell my mama you approve.

246
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,200
On both counts.

247
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,200
These jerks always say

248
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,200
that I'm the youngest-looking agent in the office.

249
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,200
You look 12.

250
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,200
Sorry to blow your fro,

251
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,200
but you should know before you start

252
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,200
that investigation is cursed.

253
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,200
Cursed?

254
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,200
The agent who last worked the case,

255
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,200
Leland Breen, is he around?

256
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,200
Breen's no longer at this office.

257
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,200
All you need to know is that we do have reason to believe

258
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,200
that Saxon is trafficking weapons and drugs,

259
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,200
but all of our raids have come up empty.

260
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,200
Your job is to go for the red tape.

261
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,200
Property records, bank accounts, purchase orders.

262
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,200
The stickier it is,

263
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,200
the stronger our federal case will be.

264
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,200
It's been a year without any progress,

265
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,200
and with the new head honchos in Washington,

266
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,200
we'd like to make some.

267
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,200
Well, we'll see what I can do.

268
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,200
We sure will.

269
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,200
All right.

270
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,200
I got a meeting.

271
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,200
Keep Grant in the loop.

272
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,200
He'll help facilitate whatever you need.

273
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,200
Good to have you.

274
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,200
Incredible.

275
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,200
So I said if you want us to open on Monday,

276
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,200
make sure I don't have a reason to pay him a visit on Sunday,

277
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,200
whiny prick.

278
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,200
Tell him you never had fondue, bread and milk and cheese.

279
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,200
No, I try everything.

280
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,200
Shit is glad.

281
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,200
Every time.

282
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,200
You could dip anything in cheese, man.

283
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,200
And the last time, but me.

284
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,200
I fucking hate cauliflower.

285
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,200
You saved my brother's life today.

286
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,200
Just doing my job.

287
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,200
My boy, my boy is alive,

288
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,200
and everyone at this table had something to do with that.

289
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,200
Genesis.

290
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,200
My baby girl.

291
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,200
Always there when I needed her.

292
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,200
And Jim.

293
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:48,200
Been driving like a batter to hell for me since you were 16.

294
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,200
Magic on wheels.

295
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,200
I thank you all.

296
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,200
To Royce.

297
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,200
To Royce!

298
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,200
You okay?

299
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,200
Man, you look at me.

300
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,200
Yeah, I got my PhD in seeing through your bullshit.

301
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,200
What's up?

302
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,200
Had to go to Ripley today.

303
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,200
Remind me of Joey.

304
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,200
Seeing Royce like that, I don't know.

305
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,200
Messed me up a little bit.

306
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,200
Saxton's son, Royce,

307
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,200
born with a congenital heart condition,

308
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:33,200
works in the family business, seems to be the heir apparent.

309
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:37,200
Saxton's daughter Genesis runs a bar in town, the Azure Lounge.

310
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,200
We'll get a federal grand jury subpoena for its bank records.

311
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:43,200
If you don't mind my asking, won't that tip them off?

312
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,200
Banks can't disclose subpoenas to their clients.

313
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,200
We'll get a peek into Saxton's organization.

314
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,200
I need the files of the agent who had this case before me.

315
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,200
Agent Brady, I've asked records for those.

316
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,200
These just came in from Phoenix PD.

317
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,200
Anything?

318
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,200
Yeah, maybe. Take a look.

319
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,200
Jesus.

320
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,200
What the fuck is this?

321
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,200
It's a conference room. We're conferring.

322
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,200
Agent Hayes brought a lot of files.

323
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,200
We're breaking down Saxton's operation.

324
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,200
Good for you, Kimasabi.

325
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,200
Clean this out. I need the room in an hour.

326
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,200
A car registered to one of Saxton's employees

327
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,200
was involved in a crash today in Ripley, California.

328
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:29,200
Saxton's man got away, but two others were hospitalized.

329
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,200
Ripley, how far is that?

330
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,200
Two and a half hour drive.

331
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,200
Okay, we'll go in the morning. Question the injured men.

332
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,200
Which car was involved?

333
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,200
A 1970 Duster, cherry red.

334
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,200
Duster.

335
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,200
Who's the driver?

336
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,200
Jimmy.

337
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,200
One more thing.

338
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,200
We've got a union issue.

339
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,200
Chess not acting shady.

340
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,200
I want to know who's putting the squeeze on him.

341
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,200
Pick a Billy after your drop-offs tomorrow.

342
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,200
Pay Chess not a visit.

343
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,200
Billy will get the name out of him.

344
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,200
Got it.

345
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,200
How's it pop?

346
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,200
Still married to Charlotte.

347
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,200
Listen, thank you for the day.

348
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,200
You sure?

349
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,200
Yes, go. I won't be here long.

350
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,200
Anything you need before I...

351
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,200
Just the brain files.

352
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,200
Records should get those to us in the morning.

353
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,200
Hey.

354
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:40,200
I'm sorry about those other agents.

355
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,200
Oh, they can go fuck themselves.

356
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,200
I'm good.

357
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,200
And then you're excellent.

358
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,200
I get benched most of the time.

359
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,200
You saw how they treat me, so...

360
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,200
It's nice to be in the game.

361
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,200
I gotta learn to not let those guys get to me.

362
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,200
You can't let that bullshit bring you down.

363
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,200
Ignorance is the enemy of progress.

364
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:10,200
No matter what, don't let those fuckers stop you.

365
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,200
Hayes...

366
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,200
You're pretty intense.

367
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,200
It's because I play to win.

368
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,200
What about you, Awan Bitsui? Do you play to win?

369
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,200
Yeah, I do.

370
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,200
Well, then I'll see you bright and early.

371
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,200
I'll see you bright and early.

372
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,200
Beep, beep!

373
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,200
Martin, get the captain!

374
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,200
Boys, come on in!

375
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,200
Joey! Kimmy!

376
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,200
Oh, shit.

377
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,200
A lot of people have been arrested and charged

378
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:09,200
for breaking into the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee

379
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,200
at the Watergate Hotel.

380
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:36,200
That's why I'm telling you I just want to celebrate, yeah, yeah

381
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,200
Another day of living, yeah

382
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,200
I just want to celebrate

383
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:47,200
I'm in my head, I'm not a man

384
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,200
Every dollar will do away

385
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,200
So I'm shining down on you

386
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,200
Have a good day

387
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,200
I just want to celebrate, yeah, yeah

388
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:01,200
Another day of living, yeah

389
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,200
I just want to celebrate

390
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,200
No matter what, this cocksucker's gonna give me a name,

391
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,200
but if I end up killing him, I'm gonna need your help cleaning up.

392
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,200
So maybe you don't kill him then.

393
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,200
Maybe shut the fuck up then.

394
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,200
No, no, no, no!

395
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,200
Oh, God.

396
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:31,200
Eyewitnesses spotted you handing a duffel bag to a guy in a red duster.

397
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,200
Where did that duffel come from, Todd?

398
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,200
I can't say, ma'am.

399
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:37,200
The man who dropped it off had a clown mask on.

400
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,200
Gave me 20 bucks to hand off the bag.

401
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,200
What about the duster? Do you recognize the driver?

402
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:45,200
No, ma'am. He just gave the phrase the clown told me,

403
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,200
24 sloppy hosiers, so I gave him the duffel and he gave me the cash.

404
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,200
And he got cinnamon chips for the little girl.

405
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,200
What little girl?

406
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:58,200
The one who was with him. He kept teaching her manners.

407
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,200
Manners?

408
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,200
Yeah, please and thank you, that sort of thing.

409
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,200
And did she have a name?

410
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:08,200
Yeah, he called her Luna. They were kind of sweet.

411
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,200
We'll take some cinnamon chips.

412
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:19,200
Did you look inside? The duffel?

413
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:23,200
Yeah, yes, ma'am. I did.

414
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,200
Goddamn it. Another fast one.

415
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,200
Got the name of that union fucker causing trouble.

416
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,200
Come on, Billy, all over the backseat.

417
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,200
We're good to go.

418
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:39,200
Thank you, Billy. Thank you, man.

419
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:44,200
You see that? I just beat the shit out of him and he's thanking me.

420
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,200
That's how good I am.

421
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:57,200
Why is it taking records so long to pull the brain files?

422
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,200
They're usually a lot faster than this.

423
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,200
Oh, so this isn't normal.

424
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,200
A whole day for a few files?

425
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:05,200
Hey, you're supposed to keep me looped in, remember?

426
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,200
What do you got so far in Saxon?

427
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:11,200
It turns out Jim Ellis picked up a human heart.

428
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,200
So we called every hospital equipped to perform a transplant within a 300-mile radius.

429
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,200
New Mexico, Nevada, California, Utah, nothing.

430
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,200
But then Agent Butsui had the brilliant idea.

431
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,200
Not brilliant, it was just a wild hunt.

432
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,200
He said, what if the surgery wasn't done in a hospital?

433
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,200
I knew a guy on the res that used to pull teeth for people who couldn't put...

434
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,200
Get to it.

435
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,200
So then we started calling medical equipment rental houses,

436
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,200
and we found a place that delivered a retractor, vascular clamps,

437
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:37,200
dissection instruments, oxygen, the whole nine to a house in Arcadia.

438
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,200
Saxton's house.

439
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:41,200
Now we got Ellis on transporting an organ across state lines.

440
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,200
Which is real leverage. We're going after him.

441
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,200
Here's the deal. Ellis will never bite.

442
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,200
He grew up in that family.

443
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:51,200
His father served with Saxton in the Second World War.

444
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,200
If you approach him, all you're going to get is him ratting you out.

445
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,200
Not if I can convince him that it is in his...

446
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,200
Ace, R.A. Saks a hard ass.

447
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:01,200
He believes in two things, God and the chain of command.

448
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:06,200
And I got six years of seniority telling you, money trails and body trails.

449
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,200
That's what you should be chasing to build this case.

450
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,200
And stay the fuck away from Ellis.

451
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,200
So now what?

452
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,200
Now we fucking go after Ellis.

453
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,200
Grace.

454
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,200
Hi, Jim.

455
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,200
Hey, Derek.

456
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,200
Linda.

457
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,200
Now that's a blouse.

458
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,200
Thank you.

459
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,200
He's ready for you.

460
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,200
Thank you, babe.

461
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,200
Jimmy.

462
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,200
What's up, boss?

463
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,200
Billy was persuasive with Chestnut.

464
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:03,200
Now we know who the Union man is, look in the lioness' pockets.

465
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,200
Names Bob Temple.

466
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,200
Lives in Tucson with his wife of 16 years.

467
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,200
You need some materials?

468
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,200
Nothing beats blackmail.

469
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,200
I'm your man.

470
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,200
I'm your man.

471
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,200
Hey, sugar, where you been?

472
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,200
Newspaper says Ellis is coming back to Tucson in November.

473
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,200
Oh, yeah?

474
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,200
You gonna take me?

475
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,200
Not so sure Kyle would approve.

476
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,200
You can ask him.

477
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,200
He's in booth three.

478
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,200
You told me to come holler.

479
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,200
I had another job.

480
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,200
I'd rather go see the king.

481
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,200
Tomorrow night there's a Union meeting in Winter Haven.

482
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,200
The job's just like Amarillo.

483
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,200
Hey, he's got a lot of money.

484
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,200
He's got a lot of money.

485
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,200
He's got a lot of money.

486
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,200
He's got a lot of money.

487
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,200
He's got a lot of money.

488
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,200
He's got a lot of money.

489
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,200
Kyle, you know what?

490
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,200
You're gonna smell this.

491
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,200
It smells like Amarillo.

492
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,200
Hey, it's good.

493
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,200
That's all you know out there.

494
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,200
Still haven't gotten those new rims.

495
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,200
Do this for me, I even put them on for you,

496
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,200
every roll and then stop.

497
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,200
Where's the fun in that?

498
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,200
You know I like to get my hands dirty.

499
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,200
Enjoy, ladies.

500
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,200
Yo, Cass.

501
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,200
Hey there, Kyle.

502
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:09,200
You gonna wave it at me?

503
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,200
How long can four patties mills take?

504
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,200
The kitchen's busy.

505
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:18,200
Come in.

506
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,200
Tell her.

507
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,200
I gotta get those fatty meals.

508
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,200
Jimmy!

509
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,200
Missy G. What's up?

510
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,200
I've got a message for Sax.

511
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,200
You tell him if he doesn't show up for some pie soon,

512
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,200
he can kiss my ass.

513
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,200
I'll tell him that we're baiting.

514
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:48,200
I'm not going to eat.

515
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:53,200
I'm not going to break my heart, take my hand.

516
00:25:53,200 --> 00:26:02,200
I'm not going to lie tonight.

517
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:05,200
Do I know you?

518
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,200
You'd remember.

519
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:11,200
So where are we going?

520
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:16,200
Well, that's up to you.

521
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:19,200
I was warned not to come see you.

522
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,200
That'd be a waste of my time.

523
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,200
That you're nothing but a loyal driver without any common sense.

524
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:27,200
Well, sister, I do love my job.

525
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:31,200
More than Luna?

526
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:37,200
Something tells me your loyalty isn't just with Ezra Saxton.

527
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:42,200
Interstate transportation of stolen property is a violation of federal law

528
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:45,200
with a sentence of up to ten years in prison.

529
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,200
I mean, that stolen property is a human organ.

530
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:51,200
Well, it's another five years.

531
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,200
That little girl will be in her twenties before you can take her for another ride

532
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:57,200
to get some cinnamon chips.

533
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:03,200
What do you want?

534
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,200
Informant contract.

535
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:08,200
Sign it, work with me to build a case against Ezra Saxton,

536
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:13,200
and I'll do everything I can to keep you out of prison.

537
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,200
How long you been at this?

538
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:21,200
That badge wall is barely got a crease.

539
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,200
It's my second day.

540
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:26,200
No kidding. Day two.

541
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:30,200
Well, here's a little heads up. You're going to have a shitty day three.

542
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,200
Where are you from? Not around here.

543
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,200
Baltimore.

544
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,200
Hmm.

545
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:40,200
You think you come out here and just wrap the Southwest rednecks around your finger?

546
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:43,200
You got a set of onions, Baltimore, and I like it.

547
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:47,200
I don't like threats, and I ain't no snitch.

548
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:51,200
Now, a chance in hell I'll sign that contract. Not now, not ever.

549
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,200
The door's to your right.

550
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:08,200
You know, I thought you'd want to see that little girl grow up.

551
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:13,200
Guess I was wrong about you.

552
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:18,200
Welcome to Phoenix.

553
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:36,200
Oh, mama, mama, I blew it.

554
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,200
You're being too hard on yourself.

555
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:43,200
I came in too fast, and I was too impatient, and I went for a CI on day two,

556
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,200
after I was warned not to.

557
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,200
They hate me in the office, mama, everybody does.

558
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,200
Okay, not everybody, but enough of them.

559
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:53,200
Baby, come on. The story is not over yet.

560
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,200
I'm never going to take this case so long.

561
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,200
I'm going to be in jail for the rest of my life.

562
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,200
Baby, come on. The story is not over yet.

563
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:04,200
They're going to take this case away from me. I know it.

564
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:07,200
Maybe worse.

565
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,200
No other field office wants me.

566
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:13,200
You always get down like this, then you get a hold of yourself.

567
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:18,200
You think, and then you find that almas. Remember? The almas?

568
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,200
Mmm, the diamond, I know.

569
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:23,200
It's always there, the thing you overlooked.

570
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:27,200
Baby, there's something. I know there is.

571
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:36,200
Mama, there were dog tags.

572
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,200
There it is.

573
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:41,200
They didn't say James Ellis, they said Joseph Ellis.

574
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,200
Well, who's Joseph Ellis?

575
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,200
Hey, pops.

576
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:55,200
AC out again.

577
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,200
You could cook a steak on the goddamn kitchen floor.

578
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,200
It's hotter than hell in there.

579
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,200
Speaking of hell, is she home?

580
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,200
Of course she is. Cut it out.

581
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,200
Fuck. I should have called.

582
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,200
Get the fuck out of my house, cocksucker.

583
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,200
Only need two minutes.

584
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,200
Well, that's three too many.

585
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,200
Good to see you too, Charlotte.

586
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:22,200
Wade, get your demon spawn out of here.

587
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:26,200
Everywhere he goes, trouble is bearing down on his sorry ass.

588
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:30,200
Don't let him mix you up in any more of his bullshit.

589
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,200
I'll handle it.

590
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:45,200
Fucking Liberace, you staying here? Where's all my stuff?

591
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:49,200
Charlotte's redecorating or some shit. I got her goddamn credit card.

592
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,200
What you looking for?

593
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,200
My passport. I left it here.

594
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,200
Passport? Where the hell are you going?

595
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,200
Getting out of town.

596
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,200
What the fuck you talking about, boy?

597
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,200
I got a feto in my ass. She wants me to ride on Saks.

598
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,200
Is she? They got lady dicks now.

599
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,200
Apparently.

600
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,200
Look, just relax, kid. The feds have been after Saks for years.

601
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:11,200
This one's different. She ain't fucking around.

602
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,200
And I ain't gonna be the one to get Saks caught.

603
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:17,200
I'm gonna go south for a while, see if I can ride for Mad Row.

604
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,200
Mad Row, are you fucking crazy?

605
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:23,200
It's the only way. I gotta get out of Dodge for a while.

606
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,200
Hope the feds can't make the case.

607
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,200
Shit cools down, I'll be back.

608
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,200
Fast for everyone.

609
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,200
You told Saks this plan yet?

610
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:35,200
I got a job I promised him I'd do.

611
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,200
And I'm meeting him in his office at midnight.

612
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,200
Tell Saks everything and head for the border.

613
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:43,200
Well, I'm gonna miss you, son.

614
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,200
I'll miss you too, Pops.

615
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,200
Hey, you be careful.

616
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,200
Yeah.

617
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,200
Joseph Ellis. Signed up to serve in Vietnam.

618
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:57,200
Two days later, his brother Jim does too.

619
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:02,200
Look at this. Jim was awarded an Army Commendation Medal for meritorious achievement, but refused it.

620
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,200
Said he was just doing his job.

621
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:07,200
Military records don't have anything on how Joey Ellis died.

622
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,200
It's because they won't.

623
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:11,200
I just got off the phone with Trisha from Phoenix PD.

624
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,200
We were sorority sisters, Delta Gamma baby.

625
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,200
Nice. What did Trisha say?

626
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,200
Joseph Ellis wasn't killed in the war.

627
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,200
He died on North 83rd Street.

628
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:23,200
Apparently he was on a job for Saxton.

629
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:29,200
What you're saying, Jim Ellis's brother worked for Saxton too?

630
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,200
Mm-hmm.

631
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,200
How did he die?

632
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,200
His van blew up.

633
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:39,200
He was working for Saxton and his van exploded.

634
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,200
Reported as an accident.

635
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:44,200
I checked our records. They recovered his body, matched his dental records.

636
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:47,200
Says here the explosion was caught on a security camera.

637
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,200
You're saying there's tape.

638
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,200
Where?

639
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,200
The basement.

640
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,200
The eucassettes are in B6.

641
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,200
Right on. Let's go.

642
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,200
Nice work.

643
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,200
Thank you.

644
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,200
Blanquito!

645
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,200
My wife says hello.

646
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,200
You two make a cute couple.

647
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:19,200
You back again to argue the virtues of Gene Hackman versus Lee Marvin?

648
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,200
Not this time.

649
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,200
Here, because I want a ride from Matt Raul.

650
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:31,200
You stay loyal to Matt Raul and you'll stay alive.

651
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,200
But you piss him off.

652
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:37,200
Matt Raul will fuck you up so hard you'll want to end your life before he does.

653
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,200
I ain't new to this. Just sign me up.

654
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,200
Stand up.

655
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,200
In the show here, por favor.

656
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,200
Well, holy shit.

657
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,200
Best wheel man in the game. Go south.

658
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,200
Matt Raul's gonna be expecting you there by Monday.

659
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:19,200
Seriously, who's responsible for cataloging this stuff?

660
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:21,200
Well, it was Diane.

661
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:23,200
This is why she was fired.

662
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,200
She couldn't organize anything.

663
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:26,200
And she only ate broccoli?

664
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,200
Yeah, that's all she ate. Huge amounts.

665
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:30,200
Nothing is where it says it is.

666
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:32,200
What you looking for?

667
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:40,200
A surveillance video.

668
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:43,200
Of what?

669
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,200
The night Jim Ellis' brother died. If we can find...

670
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:48,200
The hell did I tell you about Ellis?

671
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,200
So now you're ignoring direct orders.

672
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:53,200
Good to know.

673
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:10,200
Hi there. Bob Temple. Room 214.

674
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:14,200
Whiskey, neat. Put it on the room. No tip.

675
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,200
That's her mother.

676
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,200
There's the fairy dust.

677
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,200
Watch me work my magic.

678
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,200
Oh shit!

679
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,200
I am so sorry.

680
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,200
Are you okay?

681
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,200
Yeah, I'm alright.

682
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,200
Oh god.

683
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,200
Accidents happen.

684
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,200
One whiskey, one genti.

685
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,200
Thank you.

686
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,200
Wow, that is a beautiful purse.

687
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,200
Well, aren't you just as sweet as I am?

688
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,200
You match me for a girl.

689
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,200
Oh, thank you.

690
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,200
Cheers.

691
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,200
Cheers.

692
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:22,200
Thank you.

693
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,200
Oh, I love that.

694
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,200
What brings you here?

695
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,200
Oh.

696
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,200
Boss man.

697
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,200
Woo.

698
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,200
Whoa.

699
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,200
You okay?

700
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:46,200
I think it's time to get out of here.

701
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,200
Right here. Let me help you out there, sir.

702
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:54,200
Thank you. Thank you so much.

703
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:56,200
Drinks are strong.

704
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:58,200
Let's get out of here.

705
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,200
You are quite a gentleman now.

706
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,200
I remember you.

707
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,200
Alright, here we go.

708
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,200
They're always so damn heavy.

709
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,200
Let's do it before this shit wears off.

710
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:34,200
Hey, what up for tits?

711
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:36,200
I love tits.

712
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:38,200
I love tits.

713
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,200
He loves tits.

714
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,200
Shut up and take the pictures.

715
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:44,200
Just two.

716
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,200
Okay, please tell him you got it.

717
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:54,200
We're good. Get dressed.

718
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:56,200
What kind of fucked up shit is this?

719
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,200
Cal, you relax.

720
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,200
I'm going to teach you to keep your hands off another man's property.

721
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:02,200
You don't own me, asshole.

722
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:04,200
I'll handle you later, you little fucking slut.

723
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,200
Cal!

724
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:10,200
Stop it!

725
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,200
Fuck off!

726
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,200
Stop it!

727
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,200
Son of a bitch!

728
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,200
I'm going to kill you.

729
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:20,200
I'm going to kill you.

730
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:22,200
I'm going to kill you.

731
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,200
Son of a bitch!

732
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:26,200
Get him, Cal!

733
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,200
It's too long.

734
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:32,200
Take it easy.

735
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:34,200
Get him!

736
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:38,200
Castor's gift.

737
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,200
Who the fuck are you?

738
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,200
Who the fuck are you?

739
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,200
After I talk to Agent Grant, I call the ASAC.

740
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:14,200
I've got an angle on Ellis.

741
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,200
Radix says you being here is more trouble than it's worth

742
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:18,200
and that he never should have approved you coming here.

743
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:22,200
He's having you transferred to Butte, Montana.

744
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:26,200
Butte?

745
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:28,200
He said it's better to do this now, before you unpack.

746
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,200
That is Siberia.

747
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:34,200
Sir, please give me a chance.

748
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:36,200
It's over his.

749
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:38,200
The memo about your reassignment's already gone out to the office.

750
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:48,200
Let's go.

751
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,200
A's.

752
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:06,200
The tape.

753
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:08,200
The tape of the van.

754
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,200
The one you were looking for.

755
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,200
You found it?

756
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:14,200
I remember Diane would sometimes alphabetize by first name.

757
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:16,200
I'm going to go check on her.

758
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:18,200
I'll be right back.

759
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:20,200
Right there.

760
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,200
Do you see that?

761
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,200
Agent Hayes.

762
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:26,200
Hello.

763
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:28,200
This the lady agent?

764
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,200
Yes, this is the lady agent.

765
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:32,200
Who is this?

766
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,200
Don't worry about me.

767
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,200
Worry about Jim Ellis.

768
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:40,200
That asshole's running to Mexico

769
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,200
to ride for some jackass called Mad Raul.

770
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:46,200
He's meeting Saxton at Snowbird at midnight

771
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:48,200
to tell him everything.

772
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:00,200
I don't know.

773
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,200
What?

774
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:04,200
Things at work are just a little

775
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,200
fucked up right now, so

776
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:08,200
took a job down south for a little while.

777
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,200
Involved cash from Mexico, those will be for me.

778
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:16,200
You know you don't need to send us money.

779
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,200
Told you I'm trying to be more responsible.

780
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:22,200
How long?

781
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:24,200
A few months, maybe more.

782
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:28,200
What, you alright?

783
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:30,200
It's going to be hard for Luna.

784
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:32,200
For her?

785
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:34,200
Yes, for Luna.

786
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,200
Give that to Peanut, would you?

787
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:46,200
Took me 50 quarters to get it.

788
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:52,200
Tell her

789
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:54,200
I promise she'll ride with me again soon.

790
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,200
Hold it right there.

791
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:30,200
You ever pull a gun on anybody before Baltimore?

792
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:32,200
Paper outline don't count.

793
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:34,200
I need you to come with me.

794
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:36,200
How did you know I'd be here?

795
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:38,200
Not exactly sure. Some crazy sounding lady

796
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:40,200
called and told me.

797
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:42,200
Oh fucking Charlotte.

798
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:44,200
Come with me.

799
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:50,200
Okay, watch it again.

800
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:04,200
Watch it again.

801
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:06,200
You digging this?

802
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:08,200
Having me watch Joey die over and over again.

803
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:10,200
What?

804
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:12,200
A summary of the police report

805
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:14,200
said that your brother's death

806
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:16,200
was an accident.

807
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:18,200
That there were leaking propane tanks in the van

808
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:20,200
that Joey was smoking.

809
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:22,200
Baltimore, what's your point?

810
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:24,200
My name is Nina. Nina Hayes.

811
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:26,200
My father's name was Virgil.

812
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:28,200
Did I get the whole family a treat?

813
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:30,200
Just my father.

814
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:32,200
He worked for Saxton too.

815
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:36,200
Bullshit.

816
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:38,200
Yeah, in Philly.

817
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:40,200
After the war.

818
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:42,200
Saxton was just getting started then,

819
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:44,200
but he was who he was.

820
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:46,200
My father had a corner store.

821
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:48,200
He ran a numbers racket for Saxton.

822
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:50,200
When people couldn't pay up,

823
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:52,200
Saxton had their heads cracked with a baseball bat.

824
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:54,200
My father couldn't take it anymore.

825
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:56,200
He wanted out.

826
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:58,200
So Saxton had my father killed

827
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:00,200
in the same way

828
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:02,200
he had your brother killed.

829
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:04,200
Hold on. The hell are you talking about?

830
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:08,200
Look.

831
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:14,200
That explosion didn't start inside.

832
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:16,200
It started below.

833
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:20,200
There was a charge placed under that van.

834
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:26,200
That doesn't prove a thing.

835
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:28,200
Your brother's death, it was a hit.

836
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:30,200
And it's not a question of what happened.

837
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:32,200
It's who did it.

838
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:34,200
Saxton killed my brother.

839
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:38,200
In my heart, I know he did.

840
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:42,200
And I think you do too.

841
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:54,200
Oh, look at that one.

842
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:02,200
Oh yeah.

843
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:04,200
If we need to use them, these will keep Temple in line.

844
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:08,200
Saxton, I got to tell you.

845
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:10,200
It's amazing, isn't it?

846
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:12,200
What's that?

847
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:14,200
How much work this shit takes.

848
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:18,200
It'd be easy just to kill him.

849
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:28,200
It's alright. What was that?

850
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:30,200
You got something to tell me?

851
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:32,200
Yeah.

852
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:38,200
Missy G says

853
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:40,200
you don't show up soon for some pie.

854
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:42,200
You can kiss her ass.

855
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:48,200
Don't you think I haven't?

856
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:02,200
I don't know.

857
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:32,200
I'm sorry.

858
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:02,200
Informant contract signed by Jim Ellis.

859
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:06,200
Great job.

860
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:33,060
The

861
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:52,200
Baltimore, I've made some promises to people.

862
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:58,200
If I sign this thing and stick around,

863
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:00,200
it's going to make my life complicated.

864
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:02,200
Dangerous.

865
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:06,200
It's going to do the same to you.

866
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:14,200
In ways you can't possibly understand.

867
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:30,200
I'm not signing this because you threatened me.

868
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:34,200
Or charmed me because I think Sax did it.

869
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:40,200
You signed it to prove it, didn't you?

870
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:44,200
What if he did?

871
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:50,200
I'll kill him myself.

872
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:00,200
I'm not going to let him get away with it.

873
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:04,200
I'm going to kill him.

874
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:08,200
I'm going to kill him.

875
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:12,200
I'm going to kill him.

876
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:16,200
I'm going to kill him.

877
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:20,200
I'm going to kill him.

878
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:24,200
I'm going to kill him.

879
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:26,200
I'm going to kill him.

880
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:30,200
I'm going to kill him.

881
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:34,200
I'm going to kill him.

882
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:38,200
I'm going to kill him.

883
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:42,200
I'm going to kill him.

884
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:46,200
I'm going to kill him.

885
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:50,200
I'm going to kill him.

886
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:52,200
I'm going to kill him.

887
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:56,200
I'm going to kill him.

888
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:00,200
I'm going to kill him.

889
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:04,200
I'm going to kill him.

890
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:08,200
I'm going to kill him.

891
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:12,200
I'm going to kill him.

892
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:16,200
I'm going to kill him.

893
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:18,200
I'm going to kill him.

894
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:22,200
I'm going to kill him.

895
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:26,200
I'm going to kill him.

896
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:30,200
I'm going to kill him.

897
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:34,200
I'm going to kill him.

898
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:38,200
I'm going to kill him.

899
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:42,200
I'm going to kill him.

900
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:44,200
I'm going to kill him.

901
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:48,200
I'm going to kill him.

902
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:52,200
I'm going to kill him.

903
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:56,200
I'm going to kill him.
