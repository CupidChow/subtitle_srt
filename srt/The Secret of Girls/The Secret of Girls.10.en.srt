"The Secret of Girls"
(Episode 10)

2
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,260
Do you think I'm ignorant?

3
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:33,500
What's wrong?

4
00:03:33,501 --> 00:03:34,700
It's fine.

5
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:47,660
Mom.

6
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:50,700
Why don't you reply to my messages?

7
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:52,980
How can I reply to you?

8
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,340
You just come back for money.

9
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:58,420
Right?

10
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:03,653
I called you asking to give me some
money, and you didn't answer me.

11
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,100
So I came back.

12
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:11,059
You doing well at your
job out in the world?

13
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:13,220
Running back home asking for money.

14
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:18,420
But I scrimp and I save every month.

15
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,899
I gave you my whole paycheque.

16
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:22,500
You said you would save it for me,

17
00:04:22,787 --> 00:04:25,507
so I came back to ask you for
money because I had an emergency.

18
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,900
Doesn't your money belong to the family?

19
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:30,500
Look at you.

20
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,099
From childhood to adulthood

21
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:35,100
I provided you with
food, drink and education.

22
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:36,959
What part of the money you give is yours?

23
00:04:37,006 --> 00:04:38,006
Go ahead and tell me.

24
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:40,100
Let me tell you.

25
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:41,580
There is no money left.

26
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:43,460
Even you ask me for it, there's none.

27
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:47,780
Where is there none left?

28
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,659
Your little brother is in a relationship.

29
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:52,179
They plan to get married next year.

30
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:53,700
So we have to buy a house.

31
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:58,620
Your father and I have
taken out all our savings.

32
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:00,700
It's still not enough for the down payment.

33
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:02,539
Adding your little bit of cash,

34
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:04,540
we can barely put an offer in on the house.

35
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,300
What money could we have left?

36
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:11,820
Buying a house?

37
00:05:11,821 --> 00:05:12,860
Yes.

38
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:16,220
Every man has to buy
a house to start a family.

39
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:19,340
Otherwise, where will the
children live in the future?

40
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:22,060
Do you think everyone is the same as you?

41
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:24,340
Tell me.

42
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:26,699
I introduced you to so many people.

43
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:27,819
You didn't even go to meet them.

44
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:28,820
You didn't get married.

45
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:34,100
If you got married earlier and had a dowry,
we wouldn't have been so strapped for cash.

46
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:36,180
And that house we got,

47
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:38,739
we have to pay 4000 yuan
back every month for the loan.

48
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:40,979
You only give back 3,000 yuan.

49
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:42,780
It's not even enough to pay back the loan.

50
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:45,780
How about this,

51
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:49,540
save a little more each month.

52
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,460
Get up to 4,000 yuan.

53
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:56,020
If it's not enough, your father
and I will make up the rest.

54
00:05:57,193 --> 00:05:58,273
It's almost enough.

55
00:05:58,580 --> 00:05:59,580
By the way.

56
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:03,580
This doesn't even include the bride price.

57
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:09,220
What else is there for me to save?

58
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:15,339
Don't eat out a couple times in a month.

59
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:16,939
Buy a couple fewer pieces of clothing.

60
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:18,539
You can easily save 500 yuan.

61
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:19,900
What do you mean you can't save?

62
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:24,860
I was fired.

63
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:27,900
And I'm not going to work.

64
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:31,580
You two handle the mortgage on your own.

65
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:34,020
Don't count on me.

66
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:38,380
How can you talk to me like this?

67
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:40,059
I raised you up.

68
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:41,580
And you talk to me like this?

69
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:42,859
I see you for who you are now.

70
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,420
You are an ungrateful person.

71
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,259
That's your brother.

72
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:47,140
You don't care about him.

73
00:06:47,141 --> 00:06:48,660
I can't!

74
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,340
What do you mean by that?

75
00:06:56,853 --> 00:06:57,853
You.

76
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:00,220
You always say that I am unfilial.

77
00:07:01,595 --> 00:07:02,795
Well what about you?

78
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:03,860
What's wrong with me?

79
00:07:03,885 --> 00:07:05,285
What's wrong with me?

80
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:08,260
Have you ever fulfilled your
responsibilities as a mother?

81
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:12,780
Have you ever cared
about me since I came back?

82
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:16,260
Did you ask me why I need the money?

83
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:19,019
Why do you need the money?

84
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:21,259
You're an adult now, aren't you?

85
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:22,940
You have your own way of thinking.

86
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:25,540
Who knows why you need money?

87
00:07:26,133 --> 00:07:28,773
You gave money to your parents
and then came back to ask for it.

88
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:30,740
You can ask others.

89
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,980
Who else has a daughter like you?

90
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:34,580
Is there anyone like you?

91
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:47,419
Say something.

92
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:49,580
How about 4000 yuan?

93
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,220
I am not filial.

94
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:01,220
I am not worthy of being your daughter.

95
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,100
From now on,

96
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,700
just pretend you never gave birth to me.

97
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:10,060
You.

98
00:08:10,346 --> 00:08:12,626
What are you talking about.

99
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,380
What are you going to do?

100
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:42,580
Hello, doctor.

101
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:43,580
Hello.

102
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,700
Could you please have a look?

103
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:52,860
You can see here.

104
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,420
Just here.

105
00:08:54,421 --> 00:08:57,500
The tumor diameter is longer than 5 cm.

106
00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:58,700
And.

107
00:08:58,701 --> 00:09:02,660
There seems to be lymph node
and organ migration occuring.

108
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,940
What do you mean?

109
00:09:08,182 --> 00:09:09,060
What I mean is...

110
00:09:09,061 --> 00:09:11,740
judging from the indications
and what the CT scan shows,

111
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:15,420
you're already in the late stages of it.

112
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:24,660
Late.

113
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:26,580
Late stage.

114
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:28,740
So...

115
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:30,780
Then...

116
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:35,580
So..

117
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:38,339
How long do you think I will live?

118
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:42,059
Is there any sort of... treatment plan?

119
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:44,499
Surgery or...

120
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,140
hospitalization?

121
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:49,980
Judging from your course of illness.

122
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:52,940
It is impossible to have surgery.

123
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:56,620
But you can choose
chemotherapy or radiotherapy.

124
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,780
If the treatment goes well,

125
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:02,259
you might have an extra few months.

126
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:03,260
That's very likely.

127
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:10,540
And...

128
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:14,780
The fee...

129
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,940
It depends on how long
the treatment goes on for.

130
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:18,980
But.

131
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:21,020
It will still cost hundreds
of thousands yuan.

132
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:26,020
I undertand.

133
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:26,740
Thank you.

134
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:27,900
Don't be worried.

135
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,140
Don't be worried.

136
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:33,780
The last words I said to
my mother before I left were,

137
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:37,100
for her to pretend like she
never had a daughter like me.

138
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,620
Ever since I was old enough to understand,

139
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:47,660
my parents told me that,

140
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,580
girls should be ambitious,

141
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:51,340
they should work hard.

142
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:55,660
Only then will they be respected by others.

143
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,660
Only then will they have a good job.

144
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,180
I have worked hard.

145
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:08,340
Actually, I'm not particularly intelligent.

146
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:11,780
But I've tried my hardest.

147
00:11:12,906 --> 00:11:16,180
I managed to get to Beijing
and attend university there.

148
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:17,820
Graduated.

149
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:18,980
Worked.

150
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:20,980
Isn't that something to be proud of?

151
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,860
When I was in my third year,

152
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:28,500
my little brother got in to university too.

153
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:30,980
He was not good at studying.

154
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:34,300
His tuition was very expensive.

155
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:37,540
My parents couldn't
afford tuition for two people,

156
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,460
so I picked up a part-time job.

157
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:42,900
To earn money, to pay for my own fees.

158
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,540
After I started working,

159
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:51,860
All the money I earned, other
than expenses like food and rent,

160
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:55,340
I gave all the rest to my mother.

161
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:59,900
There's very little ignorance in you.

162
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,540
My classmates gave me a nickname.

163
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:15,236
They called me "Voldemort" [TN: A pun/slang
for women who are devoted to their family]

164
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:16,700
Actually, I never thought

165
00:12:17,293 --> 00:12:19,733
that it was wrong to give the
money I earned to my parents.

166
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:26,540
I don't think it's wrong
for me to have a younger brother either.

167
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,740
They're my kin.

168
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:33,620
They are related to me by blood.

169
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:36,900
The closest people in the world.

170
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:41,540
I try my best to be good to them.

171
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:43,900
It's not wrong.

172
00:12:46,613 --> 00:12:47,053
It's just that...

173
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:48,940
the biggest mistake is...

174
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:54,060
I was not chosen.

175
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,480
It's not that I can't be
good to my brother.

176
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:07,580
Why can't I be the one that was chosen?
