"The Secret of Girls"
(Episode 16)

2
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,320
Tired?

3
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,280
I'm okay now.

4
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,600
Drink some water.

5
00:03:44,146 --> 00:03:45,146
Be careful.

6
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,320
There's still some time before sunrise.

7
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,600
Let's have a rest now.

8
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:56,520
By the way

9
00:03:56,521 --> 00:03:57,640
I bought some food.

10
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,680
Would you like some?

11
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,440
I am not hungry.

12
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,440
I don't want to eat now.

13
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,720
Just a little tired.

14
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,480
Oh, no, it's a bit chilly.

15
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,839
Don't be so nervous.

16
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,120
You'll freeze like that.

17
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,920
Okay.

18
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,760
See over there.

19
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,040
The sun will come up
from there in a minute.

20
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,080
That mountain.

21
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,960
Have you ever come here before?

22
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,680
Who'd you come with?

23
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,160
On my own.

24
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,280
When I just came here.

25
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,840
Back then I was by myself.

26
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,480
When I just came here, I was alone.

27
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,239
I heard that the sunrise is so glorious.

28
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,800
So I came.

29
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,680
Wen Shan.

30
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,960
I have never see the sunrise.

31
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,440
Even the moon at night,

32
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,120
I only really saw it after I met you.

33
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,599
You didn't sleep at night.

34
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,920
You'd go out and watch the moon.

35
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:12,960
So.

36
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,040
Which one do you prefer...

37
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,320
the rising sun?

38
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,800
Or the moon at night?

39
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,160
I don't know.

40
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,640
How about you?

41
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,840
Before this it was the moon.

42
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,440
You had to put a
qualifying time on it, huh.

43
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,640
Yes.

44
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,400
Can I know the reason?

45
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,560
No, I will not tell you.

46
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,400
It's my secret.

47
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,720
So many secrets.

48
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,439
I need a shoulder to lean on

49
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,600
I'm exhausted.

50
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,440
Well, you'd better take a rest.

51
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,680
Once the sun starts coming out,

52
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,760
I will wake you up, okay?

53
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Okay.

54
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,040
Wen Shan.

55
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,080
When we get back,

56
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,520
can you cook noodles for me?

57
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:23,960
I haven't eaten the noodles
you make in a long time.

58
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,440
Didn't you not like them at the start?

59
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,040
No.

60
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,560
I loved it.

61
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,120
Sure, if you like.

62
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,360
I will cook it for you everyday.

63
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,360
For real?

64
00:06:43,586 --> 00:06:44,586
Sure.

65
00:06:44,773 --> 00:06:45,773
It's a deal.

66
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:52,600
Then I'm looking forward to everyday ahead.

67
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,520
Wen Shan.

68
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,480
Is the sun coming out soon?

69
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,360
Yes, soon.

70
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,880
Very soon.

71
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,960
Just wait a minute.

72
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,120
Wen Shan.

73
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:17,840
Wen Shan.

74
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:24,960
Wen Shan.

75
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,320
Xu Jingxi.

76
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,720
Xu Jingxi gave it to me.

77
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,600
And reminded me to give you after she left.

78
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:27,840
So mysterious.

79
00:08:28,273 --> 00:08:30,753
Perhaps you should open it now?

80
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,680
It's okay.

81
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,680
I know what it is.

82
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,000
To my dear Wen Shan.

83
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:42,840
I am sorry.

84
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,440
When you see this letter,

85
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,280
I think I will have left already.

86
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:51,920
Wen Shan.

87
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,160
I feel so fortunate to have met you.

88
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,920
In the last stretch of my life,

89
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,880
I met you.

90
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,600
You must be confused.

91
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,640
Even resentment.

92
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,000
Why didn't I tell you?

93
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,640
I want to say.

94
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,640
I am so appreciative that
I had enough time

95
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,960
to help you open your heart.

96
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,720
Stop, so itchy.

97
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,720
And to embrace the world again.

98
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,480
After I leave, I hope...

99
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:27,720
You can treat others just
like how you treated me.

100
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,280
You don't need to keep
any resentment or resistance.

101
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,440
But if you're scared you can't do it,

102
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,040
it's fine.

103
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,240
I really mean that.

104
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,600
Just be yourself.

105
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,280
Be happy.

106
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,640
Just be happy.

107
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,720
You once said,

108
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,840
you like the moon the most.

109
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,840
Since there's no one else around at night,

110
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,280
The moon belongs only to you.

111
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,280
And yet,

112
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,760
I want to see the sunrise with you.

113
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,000
I want you to see the sun with me.

114
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,320
I hope you can be like the sun.

115
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,000
Be passionate.

116
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,440
Be positive.

117
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,360
I wonder that when you get this letter,

118
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,440
have we seen the sunrise together?

119
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,040
If we did,

120
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,000
it must've been beautiful.

121
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,320
Glorious.

122
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,280
Right?

123
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,920
If we didn't make it,

124
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,840
it's also fine.

125
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,360
I will be your moon.

126
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,040
The moon belongs only to you.

127
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,400
Xu Jingxi.

128
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,800
I need to go to the restroom.

129
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,680
Xu Jingxi.

130
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,960
Can I give you a hug?

131
00:11:50,372 --> 00:11:51,372
When you're with me,

132
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,440
you always can just be yourself.

133
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,040
Do you hear me?

134
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,400
Yes!

135
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,680
Pretty?

136
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,240
Xu Jingxi.

137
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,320
The sun is rising.

138
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,400
It's beautiful.

139
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,640
Do you see it?
