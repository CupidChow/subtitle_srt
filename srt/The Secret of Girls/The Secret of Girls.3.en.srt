"The Secret of Girls"
(Episode 3)

2
00:03:29,056 --> 00:03:30,415
Okay, stop talking.

3
00:03:30,416 --> 00:03:31,416
Do it.

4
00:03:31,576 --> 00:03:32,576
And these.

5
00:03:35,536 --> 00:03:36,576
Won't you help me.

6
00:03:38,216 --> 00:03:39,216
Then I'll do it.

7
00:03:40,336 --> 00:03:40,936
It's okay.

8
00:03:40,936 --> 00:03:41,936
You go on ahead.

9
00:03:53,496 --> 00:03:55,096
A stank face so early in the morning.

10
00:04:10,976 --> 00:04:11,976
It's so messy.

11
00:04:12,736 --> 00:04:13,736
Clean it up.

12
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:23,336
I put it here for you.

13
00:04:23,376 --> 00:04:24,376
OK, thank you.

14
00:04:28,136 --> 00:04:29,136
What?

15
00:04:29,376 --> 00:04:30,936
You've never been in a relationship?

16
00:04:31,096 --> 00:04:32,096
You're crazy.

17
00:04:32,216 --> 00:04:33,216
Use this.

18
00:04:41,616 --> 00:04:43,416
Speak more kindly, why
are you so aggressive?

19
00:05:10,536 --> 00:05:11,776
What should I do now?

20
00:05:11,896 --> 00:05:13,096
Throw these away.

21
00:05:19,456 --> 00:05:20,456
Wow.

22
00:05:20,616 --> 00:05:22,056
This smells really good

23
00:05:22,136 --> 00:05:24,856
I felt it smelled especially good
when I took a shower in the morning.

24
00:05:25,336 --> 00:05:26,896
It smells like some flower,

25
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:29,408
but I can't remember what
kind of flower right now.

26
00:05:29,736 --> 00:05:30,736
Have a sniff.

27
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:32,216
Are you okay?

28
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:33,056
I'm so sorry.

29
00:05:33,136 --> 00:05:34,215
Let me take a look for you.

30
00:05:34,216 --> 00:05:35,296
Don't touch me.

31
00:05:36,616 --> 00:05:37,775
But let me just take a look.

32
00:05:37,776 --> 00:05:38,776
Don't touch me.

33
00:05:39,576 --> 00:05:40,576
I'm so sorry.

34
00:05:42,936 --> 00:05:43,936
White tea.

35
00:06:16,981 --> 00:06:17,981
Who are you?

36
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:18,840
Hello

37
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:19,720
I'm an employee here.

38
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,560
My name is Xu Jingxi.

39
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,440
How can I help you?

40
00:06:21,465 --> 00:06:22,465
Employee?

41
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:24,090
Why have I never seen you before?

42
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,720
Are you a guest or...

43
00:06:26,745 --> 00:06:28,345
I own this inn.

44
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:29,980
Boss lady!

45
00:06:30,005 --> 00:06:31,125
Sorry.

46
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:31,960
It's just "Boss."

47
00:06:31,985 --> 00:06:32,985
Hello, boss.

48
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,120
I just arrived last night.

49
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,080
Who hired you?

50
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:38,105
The sourp...

51
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,160
Wen Shan.

52
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,600
Wen Shan hired me.

53
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,359
Where is Wen Shan?

54
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,520
Why don't I see her?

55
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,879
She's in the lounge.

56
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,239
She accidentally hit her head.

57
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,000
And feel a bit dizzy

58
00:06:47,001 --> 00:06:48,176
I guess she's still having a rest.

59
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,200
Hit her head?

60
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,600
Okay, I'll go see her.

61
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,400
Okay.

62
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,480
Then do your best.

63
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,520
Okay, boss.

64
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,640
Boss, you are so pretty.

65
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,359
I heard you hit your head.

66
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,360
Are you okay?

67
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,640
I'm fine, just an accident.

68
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,440
Oh you,

69
00:07:14,441 --> 00:07:16,600
You get nervous at the smallest things.

70
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,280
The person outside, who is she?

71
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,480
The newly hired staff

72
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,160
I didn't get a chance to tell you.

73
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,040
What kind of person is she?

74
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,960
She doesn't look like a college student.

75
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,160
I don't know.

76
00:07:29,161 --> 00:07:30,519
She came to check in yesterday.

77
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,319
And said she lost her phone and ID card.

78
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,840
I thought let her work
to pay off the room fee.

79
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,440
Wen Shan, have you gotten
stupid from your head injury?

80
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,239
You let her stay without an ID?

81
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,440
You don't even know
who she is and you just took her in.

82
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,280
It's better safe than
sorry when running an inn.

83
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,360
What if she ran away from a marriage?

84
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,120
What if she's an illegal immigrant?

85
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,040
You should never intent to hurt people, but
never drop your guard.

86
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,320
Am I right?

87
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:53,760
One hundred yuan per day.

88
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,400
Meal and accommodation provided.

89
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,400
Isn't that fine?

90
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:56,880
Oh, I see.

91
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,879
I think that girl is quite nimble.

92
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,360
She's pretty, too.

93
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,640
She shouldn't be a bad person.

94
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:07,039
Didn't you say you were
going to hang out with Qiu Bei?

95
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,320
Why are you still in the inn?

96
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,400
This is my inn

97
00:08:10,535 --> 00:08:12,215
I come whenever I want, are you my keeper?

98
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,160
Don't mention Qiu Bei to me, anyway

99
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,640
I get angry when you mention her.

100
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,719
It's not easy to get into the off-season.

101
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,640
There aren't many guests

102
00:08:18,641 --> 00:08:19,719
I told her yesterday.

103
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,416
Let's go out and have
fun for a couple days.

104
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,680
You know what she told me?

105
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,760
She told me she was busy and couldn't leave.

106
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,239
As if my inn wasn't busy.

107
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,360
Why can I leave?

108
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,360
She said I had you to help me.

109
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,919
So what, am I supposed
to pay to take care of you?

110
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,336
You also have to look after her bar.

111
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,560
Her bar would actually
have to close without her.

112
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,880
Then let it close!

113
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,440
There's never enough money.

114
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:38,560
Besides.

115
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,440
How much could that bar of hers even make?

116
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:41,920
Okay.

117
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,080
You're right.

118
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,480
You don't have to be appease me like that.

119
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,120
What's her name?

120
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,160
Xu Jingxi.

121
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,080
Xu Jingxi.

122
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,799
It's still an issue that
she doesn't have her ID.

123
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,200
You'd better investigate it clearly.

124
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,480
She can't do this job forever.

125
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,080
Yes

126
00:08:58,081 --> 00:08:59,239
I'll contact the police station.

127
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,760
She'll go to register in the afternoon.

128
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,840
Okay.

129
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,176
That damn Qiu Bei,
she makes me so angry that my head hurts.

130
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,440
I'll be in the back for a while.

131
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,840
What's for lunch?

132
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,480
Tomato and egg.

133
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:14,880
OK

134
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,120
I'll go.

135
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,560
Be careful, it's hot.

136
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,360
Put it here.

137
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:44,400
Sis Yun.

138
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,240
You guys eat first

139
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:45,960
I'm going out for a while.

140
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,960
Okay.

141
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,439
Go call the newbie to eat.

142
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,440
OK

143
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:51,840
Not ready yet?

144
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:52,880
Ready.

145
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,400
Come on.

146
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,400
Come on quickly.

147
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,519
Xiao Xu.

148
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,520
Xu Jingxi.

149
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,280
OK

150
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,280
Jingxi, come and sit.

151
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,680
Come and try Wen Shan's cooking.

152
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,639
Noodles with gravy

153
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,400
I didn't know Sourpuss
could cook like this.

154
00:10:07,735 --> 00:10:08,655
Sourpuss?

155
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,680
Who?

156
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,920
Wen Shan.

157
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,240
That's actually pretty accurate.

158
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:15,640
Come on, no need for manners here.

159
00:10:15,641 --> 00:10:16,800
Eat and serve yourself.

160
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,880
Thank you, boss.

161
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,200
Don't thank me, I didn't cook.

162
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,360
Xiao Xu.

163
00:10:22,415 --> 00:10:23,576
How many people are there in your family?

164
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,600
Where are you from?

165
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,840
Why are you here?

166
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,079
Many young people come here

167
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,176
either because they are heartbroken
or they are looking for true love.

168
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,080
Why are you here?

169
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,320
I am...

170
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,760
Are you checking her
household registration?

171
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,120
I wasn't asking you.

172
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,399
I was employed.

173
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,439
Now I lost my job

174
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,240
I came out to travel.

175
00:10:39,241 --> 00:10:41,800
But I lost my phone and ID card.

176
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,600
So that's how it is.

177
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,679
Why did you come alone?

178
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,680
Where is your partner?

179
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,360
I've never been in a relationship.

180
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,880
You have never had
someone you like in your life?

181
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,600
Someone I like...

182
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,919
Not really.

183
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,440
Maybe it's just not the right time yet.

184
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,640
Besides, no one likes me.

185
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,360
You are such a pretty
girl, but no guys like you.

186
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,280
It's normal if you say
no guys like Wen Shan.

187
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,320
But if no guys like you,
then they must be blind.

188
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,720
What's wrong with me?

189
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,480
You are so nice.

190
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,759
Incredibly nice.

191
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,919
Especially the noodles you cook.

192
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:19,920
So great.

193
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,200
Boss.

194
00:11:22,201 --> 00:11:24,199
But I didn't expect you to be so real.

195
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,040
And you get along so
well with your employees.

196
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,280
There aren't many people at all.

197
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,000
Why should I make myself high and mighty?

198
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,319
Not like you working in the big city office.

199
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,160
Brown-nosing is a survival skill.

200
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,200
Otherwise you'd burn out every day.

201
00:11:36,455 --> 00:11:38,655
If it isn't the office politics,

202
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,520
then its the boss abusing their power.

203
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,480
What place could be more
comfortable than here?

204
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,096
How did you nail every single detail?

205
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,640
Boss, you've worked before?

206
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
How about you?

207
00:11:48,001 --> 00:11:50,080
Now that you're here, just give your best.

208
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,719
I see you're quite skillful.

209
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,119
If there's anything you don't understand.

210
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,120
Just ask Wen Shan.

211
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:57,080
After your ID card is issued,
you should travel around.

212
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,760
Once you've had fill of fun, you
must go back to work properly.

213
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,520
Us women,

214
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,400
we need to have our own jobs.

215
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,959
Only when you are financially
independent can you not rely on anyone.

216
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,320
Do you understand?

217
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,320
You are right.

218
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,160
I'm a woman too.

219
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,200
You're a woman.

220
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,600
Just not friendly enough, we
can never be close in this lifetime.

221
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,879
Look at me and Xiao Xu.

222
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:20,600
Like old friends from first glance.

223
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,280
We'll be able to talk all night in two days.

224
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,280
Not like you.

225
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,040
It's like you seeing a ghost
when I get close to you.

226
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,200
Are you okay?

227
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,359
Let me take a look for you.

228
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,520
Don't touch me.

229
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,760
Your shoulders are probably rusty.

230
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,560
Try this.

231
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:40,720
Come on.

232
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,640
Add more gravy.

233
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,640
OK

234
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:43,680
Let me try.

235
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,680
Try it.

236
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,080
It's delicious.

237
00:12:49,216 --> 00:12:51,696
No matter how delicious it is,
you can't eat it for a whole month.

238
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,280
If you don't like it, just don't eat it.

239
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,839
Can you cook some food differently?

240
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,120
Ask Qiu Bei to cook for you.

241
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,560
Who is Qiu Bei?
