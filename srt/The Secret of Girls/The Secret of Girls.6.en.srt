"The Secret of Girls"
(Episode 6)

2
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,020
Long Island Iced Tea

3
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:26,740
I'll treat you.

4
00:03:26,741 --> 00:03:28,140
Thank you, boss.

5
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:30,820
You aren't allowed to drink.

6
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,020
Why not?

7
00:03:33,021 --> 00:03:34,100
The boss treated me.

8
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,380
Not anymore.

9
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:36,459
Why I have to listen to you?

10
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:38,020
The boss wants to treat me.

11
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:39,740
No, you are not allowed to drink.

12
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:01,540
Boss, I'll pay for that
drink "whatever" iced tea.

13
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,540
Treating or buying is not a problem.

14
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:11,700
But the core issue here is
why you aren't allowed to drink.

15
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:12,900
Oh, right.

16
00:04:12,901 --> 00:04:14,181
Why won't you allow me to drink?

17
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,500
No reason.

18
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:18,780
Ignore her, boss.

19
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:19,780
That's how she is.

20
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,540
Get me the drink, I'll buy it.

21
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:24,820
If I say I'll treat you,
then I'll treat you.

22
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:25,900
Keep the money.

23
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:27,340
Just call me Qiu Bei.

24
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:28,980
You are so nice.

25
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:30,180
Thank you.

26
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,180
You should learn to be like her.

27
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:50,500
Drink slowly.

28
00:04:51,252 --> 00:04:52,692
I like it if it tastes good.

29
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:59,020
It tastes pretty good.

30
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:07,980
As expected, you sing here every night.

31
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:10,780
Why didn't Xiao Yu tell me?

32
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,780
But to be honest.

33
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:20,860
You really sing very well.

34
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:24,060
You want me to thank you?

35
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:26,420
Of course.

36
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:29,140
I'm a guest now.

37
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:34,219
If I praise your singing,
you have to say thank you to me.

38
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:36,380
This is the most basic courtesy.

39
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:40,180
Let me tell you both.

40
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,820
I was just passing by.

41
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:49,700
Then I was attracted by the singing.

42
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,140
But guess what

43
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:57,060
I walked in and saw this sourpuss.

44
00:05:57,637 --> 00:05:58,770
[♪annoying drunk laughter♪]

45
00:05:58,996 --> 00:06:00,060
Sourpuss?

46
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:04,180
Yes, don't you think
she has a stern face all day long?

47
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:06,860
Just like someone owes her money.

48
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:10,740
But the boss is different.

49
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:14,740
The boss is nice.

50
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:16,540
And pretty.

51
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:19,060
She smiles all day long.

52
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:27,700
She paid me my salary today.

53
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:31,020
She gave me an extra 50 yuan per day.

54
00:06:31,045 --> 00:06:32,125
That's a lot of money.

55
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,540
She even let me take
the day off to go have fun.

56
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:36,420
Sis Yun is so nice.

57
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:39,380
Ling Yun is a good person...?

58
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:42,540
You don't agree.

59
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:44,300
I agree.

60
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,300
Agree to what?

61
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:48,020
She's pretty and nice.

62
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:50,420
Yeah, that's right.

63
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:58,540
I'll return the 100 yuan
I borrowed from you.

64
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:03,740
Hey, this one is torn, so give it to you.

65
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:07,780
Thank you for letting me sleep for a night.

66
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:15,420
Hey, think clearly before you speak.

67
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:18,460
What do you want to think clearly about?

68
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:20,180
You think it's torn?

69
00:07:20,771 --> 00:07:22,451
Then I'll give you a new one.

70
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:25,780
What's going on?

71
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:31,820
Qiu Bei.

72
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:34,460
I'm telling you something from my heart.

73
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:37,419
The drink you mixed for me.

74
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:39,060
No, that "whatever" iced tea.

75
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,860
It's quite tasty.

76
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:46,620
The only problem with it is.

77
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,580
It's hitting me hard.

78
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:56,740
Already drunk?

79
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:58,819
What are you talking about?

80
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:00,020
I can hear you.

81
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:05,059
I told you she couldn't drink.

82
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,100
You insisted she drink.

83
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,020
Well you take care of her.

84
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:20,700
Wen Shan.

85
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:22,580
How can you just watch without caring?

86
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:24,219
Didn't I try to stop her from drinking?

87
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:25,379
You insisted on treating her.

88
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:26,620
Now you are responsible for it.

89
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:29,099
I thought she had no
money, so I treated her

90
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,780
I don't know she couldn't drink it at all.

91
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:32,580
What are you talking about?

92
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:34,060
I can drink!

93
00:08:34,086 --> 00:08:35,499
Another cup of "whatever" iced tea.

94
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,580
Keep drinking.

95
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,100
Don't move.

96
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43,100
Don't move.

97
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:46,540
We're almost there.

98
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:48,140
I'll leave her to you.

99
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:50,620
I'm worried about Ling
Yun being alone at home.

100
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:52,860
If she starves to death
I will say it's your fault.

101
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:54,739
Go ahead and leave it to her.

102
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:55,660
It's okay.

103
00:08:55,661 --> 00:08:56,780
You are disloyal.

104
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:57,940
Bye.

105
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:16,060
Make way! Her highness returns to court.

106
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,979
I didn't take my bag.

107
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,980
What do you even have left in there?

108
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:27,580
That makes sense.

109
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,380
Let's go.

110
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:31,140
Xu Jingxi

111
00:09:31,141 --> 00:09:32,259
I really owed you in my last life.

112
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:33,540
Go faster or I'm going to vomit.

113
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:19,700
I'm not drunk.

114
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:21,180
Oh my God.

115
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:22,380
I'm sorry.

116
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:23,420
Let me help you.

117
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:24,580
Don't touch me.

118
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:27,620
Hold on to me.

119
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:38,580
Why am I...

120
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:41,620
not trying to resist her as much?

121
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:52,300
Stop it, it's so itchy.

122
00:10:58,660 --> 00:10:59,660
Xu Jingxi.

123
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,700
Are you drunk?

124
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:04,260
No.

125
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:09,500
I'm leaving, let me go.

126
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:13,099
Why are you holding onto me?

127
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:15,100
You are holding onto me.

128
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:17,340
Let's go to sleep.

129
00:11:30,108 --> 00:11:31,388
Please don't leave.

130
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,940
Don't leave me alone.

131
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:38,220
They don't even want me anymore.

132
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:34,620
Why are you in my room?

133
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,140
When did you come in?

134
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:38,099
What happened?

135
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,620
Who allowed you to sleep with me?

136
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,060
Say something.

137
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:01,740
Xu Jingxi.

138
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,160
If you drink again.

139
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:07,340
I will kill you with my own to hands.
