"The Secret of Girls"
(Episode 14)

2
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:26,900
Come on.

3
00:03:26,901 --> 00:03:28,059
Let's grab a drink.

4
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:29,580
Let's celebrate that Xu Jingxi's back.

5
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:31,180
Welcome.

6
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:34,860
Don't drink too much.

7
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,100
Jingxi.

8
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:39,139
To tell the truth I've thought
that you would come back.

9
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:41,020
But I didn't expect that
you came back so soon.

10
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:42,820
Why, am I not welcome?

11
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,060
How could you think that?

12
00:03:44,061 --> 00:03:45,300
I'm very happy for your back.

13
00:03:45,853 --> 00:03:48,013
You're happy that
you have someone working for you.

14
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:50,100
I'm not that snobbish.

15
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:52,420
As for me

16
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:54,059
I'm happy when I'm happy.

17
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:56,180
Unlike some people
who say one thing and mean another.

18
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:57,820
In their hearts they're very happy.

19
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:59,076
But they're still so cold on the surface.

20
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,940
Who?

21
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,180
Who says one thing and means another?

22
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:06,300
You.

23
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:07,700
What did I do?

24
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,739
You're good.

25
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:11,740
Very good.

26
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,139
Ignore her.

27
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,180
She's all mixed up.

28
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:15,780
But having said that.

29
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:17,556
Have you done what you needed to do?

30
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:18,940
Pretty much.

31
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:20,300
But Sister Yun

32
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:23,700
I probably won't have time
to work in the Inn this time.

33
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:24,660
Why?

34
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:25,660
You need to leave?

35
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:28,299
I came here for travel last time.

36
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,339
But something unexpected happened

37
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:30,419
and I lost all my things.

38
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:31,340
I didn't finish traveling.

39
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:32,020
So...

40
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:33,059
this time, I've decided that

41
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,820
I'll take a good look around.

42
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,499
I heard that the sunrise
here is very beautiful.

43
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:36,820
That's right.

44
00:04:36,821 --> 00:04:38,339
You should spend a good time here.

45
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:40,140
The natural scenery is so great here.

46
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:42,299
And there's that market.

47
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:42,980
It's very beautiful.

48
00:04:42,981 --> 00:04:44,220
Many young people go there.

49
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:45,340
Wen Shan.

50
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:46,300
Take her to play for few days

51
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:47,300
I give you two days off.

52
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:49,140
No problem.

53
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,540
You can use my car.

54
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:51,500
Go play around more.

55
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,300
Okay.

56
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:54,260
Thank you, Qiu Bei.

57
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:56,179
Why are you only thanking Qiu Bei?

58
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:57,340
I bought her the car.

59
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:58,500
Okay.

60
00:04:58,525 --> 00:05:00,965
The most important is
saying thank you to Sister Yun.

61
00:05:01,355 --> 00:05:02,755
But Sister Yun, please drink less.

62
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:04,179
You drink so quickly.

63
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,420
Don't get too drunk.

64
00:05:05,813 --> 00:05:08,093
Her tolerance to alcohol is wild.

65
00:05:08,188 --> 00:05:09,468
I've never seen her drunk.

66
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,500
Really?

67
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:13,060
Why do I feel that you
always want to get me drunk?

68
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:14,259
Tell me the truth.

69
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:15,940
Does it benefit you if I get drunk?

70
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,139
No

71
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:18,660
I just haven't seen it

72
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,100
I'm curious.

73
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:22,716
But to be honest
Sister Yun really hasn't drank much.

74
00:05:22,955 --> 00:05:24,196
Is her tolerance really that good?

75
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:25,220
No

76
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:26,340
I am so jealous.

77
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:27,499
You should be envious.

78
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,500
Wen Shan.

79
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:29,939
When Xu Jingxi was drunk last time,

80
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:32,140
did she hug your neck
and cry and make a scene?

81
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,219
How can you remember that so clearly?

82
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:37,020
Who got drunk and hugged
you while making a scene...

83
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:38,900
Talk about it!

84
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:41,940
Lame.

85
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:42,300
Come on.

86
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:42,780
Have a drink.

87
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:43,780
Stop making a scene.

88
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,220
Quickly

89
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:46,499
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

90
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,500
Are you trying to avoid drinking?

91
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,020
No

92
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,260
I'll come back soon.

93
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:50,300
Hurry up.

94
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:52,099
Look, you've been called shy.

95
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,100
It's all your fault.

96
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:58,660
When did you come back?

97
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:02,220
Just now.

98
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:09,820
Are you feeling sick?

99
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:11,700
I'm fine

100
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:14,613
I just... woke up so early in the morning.

101
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,320
I'm tired.

102
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:16,700
Everything is OK.

103
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,180
Don't go.

104
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:21,380
Lay down.

105
00:07:21,766 --> 00:07:22,766
I'm fine.

106
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:24,940
We're almost done eating.

107
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:26,540
I'll clean up.

108
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:27,580
Lay down there.

109
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:28,380
Don't worry about it.

110
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:29,380
It's okay.

111
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:30,580
It's not very good.

112
00:07:30,581 --> 00:07:31,980
Let me help you.

113
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,060
You go to have a rest.

114
00:07:37,073 --> 00:07:38,673
Why are you so mean?

115
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:40,620
Come here.

116
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:59,060
Have a good rest.

117
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:15,780
Are you fall asleep?

118
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:19,580
What's wrong?

119
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:28,460
You've found a job, right?

120
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,180
Emmm...

121
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:37,940
I don't want it.

122
00:08:38,853 --> 00:08:40,453
Why?

123
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,500
Have a guess.

124
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:46,420
No, I don't.

125
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,140
It's boring.

126
00:08:53,066 --> 00:08:54,066
Because of me?

127
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:10,340
I'm afraid of that someone can't sleep well

128
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,660
because of my absence.

129
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:16,300
And then they go to work with dark circles
under their eyes the next day,

130
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:18,100
and scare away the customers.

131
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,700
Who? I don't know.

132
00:09:22,387 --> 00:09:23,187
Right.

133
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,540
Who could it be?

134
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:26,540
I don't know, either.

135
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:30,180
Mine is an ailment of the soul.

136
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,900
It can't be changed overnight

137
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:34,820
I've tried my best.

138
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:37,780
You're great.

139
00:09:40,987 --> 00:09:42,267
How long can you stay with me?

140
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:45,980
For a lifetime?

141
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:57,660
Wen Shan.

142
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,620
I don't know how long
that I can stay with you.

143
00:10:06,766 --> 00:10:07,766
But...

144
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:11,300
If I can be next to you,

145
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:14,180
you could sleep well,

146
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,660
and gradually move away from the darkness,

147
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:20,060
I hope I could be with you for a long time.

148
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,300
Wen Shan.

149
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:32,900
I don't have anyone worth caring about.

150
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:39,060
Of course, it seems that
no one cares about me.

151
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,060
But...

152
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:45,460
people go on living,

153
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:48,940
there must be something to care about.

154
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,460
Someone to care about.

155
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:53,820
Only in times of pain and despair.

156
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,260
Can people live a good life,

157
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:58,340
and try their best to live.

158
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,500
Only in this way can life be valuable.

159
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:04,420
Even a little bit of it is good.

160
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:07,140
Now.

161
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:11,780
You are the one that I care about the most.
