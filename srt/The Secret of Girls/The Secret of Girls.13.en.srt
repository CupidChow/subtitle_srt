"The Secret of Girls"
(Episode 13)

2
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:23,100
Instant noodles are also delicious

3
00:04:23,101 --> 00:04:24,260
I like this taste the most.

4
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:30,140
Great.

5
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,500
Hello doctor.

6
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,139
Why did you come alone?

7
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,340
Where are your family members?

8
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:09,980
It doesn't matter.

9
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,060
I'm mentally prepared.

10
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:15,020
According to the
characteristics of your pathology,

11
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:17,980
there are some symptoms
that have appeared before.

12
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:20,659
For example, you fainted and vomitted.

13
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:22,580
These are normal reactions at this stage.

14
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:24,620
But in the future,

15
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,340
these symptoms may become more common.

16
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,620
The frequency between
instances may decrease as well.

17
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:32,173
The worsening will move quickly,

18
00:05:32,792 --> 00:05:33,792
until...

19
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:36,380
I got it.

20
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:37,420
Thank you doctor.

21
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:40,219
Doctor, please give me
some more painkillers.

22
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:41,220
Thank you.

23
00:08:03,026 --> 00:08:04,226
You haven't fallen asleep yet.

24
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:09,140
What are you laughing at?

25
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:10,860
You aren't sleeping, either.

26
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:14,340
I fell asleep.

27
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:16,660
I woke up.

28
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,940
I looked at your message.

29
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:29,740
Have you become an insomniac again?

30
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:39,780
You...

31
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,580
Are you OK?

32
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,740
Yes, I'm fine.

33
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:52,740
Let me tell you.

34
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:56,260
I cleaned up the house
for the past two days.

35
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,100
I also went for an interview.

36
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:01,460
I received a new offer.

37
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:03,860
It's a international company.

38
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:05,460
Maybe in the future,

39
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:07,180
when I start working,

40
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:09,700
I'll be particularly busy.

41
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,340
But I can earn so more much money.

42
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:18,500
Maybe I'll be so busy that
I won't have time to eat.

43
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:20,260
No time to go out for fun.

44
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:24,380
Maybe I'll go abroad.

45
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:35,620
Wen Shan.

46
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:39,940
If I go abroad,

47
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:42,540
I might...

48
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,780
not be able to contact you.

49
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:50,500
There may be a time difference.

50
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:52,180
It's also possible

51
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:54,820
that I won't see you again.

52
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,100
Wen Shan.

53
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:01,660
Take care of yourself.

54
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:05,140
Xu Jingxi.

55
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:10,620
Can you see the moon there?

56
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,140
Yes, I can.

57
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:22,220
Isn't it...

58
00:10:22,493 --> 00:10:23,613
big and round?

59
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:29,460
It's big...

60
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:31,420
bright...

61
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:33,500
and round.

62
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:36,420
So...

63
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:39,580
don't be afraid.

64
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:42,500
Even if you are busy working abroad,

65
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:45,179
or we can't contact each other,

66
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:48,020
you must remember to
look up at the night sky.

67
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:51,620
We can see the same moon.

68
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:56,140
Great.

69
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,540
We can see the same moon.

70
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:09,740
Go to sleep.

71
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:12,660
Good night.

72
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,779
Sister Shan, this is the key
for check-out room in the morning.

73
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:30,339
And I'll take this lady to her room.

74
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:31,180
Give me the key.

75
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:32,180
Sure.

76
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:33,260
The key.

77
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:40,380
This isn't the one.

78
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,740
I'm sorry.

79
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:46,820
Here you are.

80
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:48,820
Take care.

81
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:49,820
Let's go, miss

82
00:11:49,821 --> 00:11:50,940
I'll take you to the room.

83
00:11:55,915 --> 00:11:58,948
"♪With♪ You" "I'm Here"

84
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:02,410
[A wind chime with "hear
the wind" written on it]

85
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:04,620
Hello.

86
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:19,660
I

87
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:22,740
I've lost my cellphone and ID card.

88
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:24,820
Can I check in?

89
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:31,060
I'm so sorry, guest.

90
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:34,540
You can't check in without your ID card.

91
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:39,300
I see.

92
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:44,220
But our workers earn 100 yuan a day.

93
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:45,860
Including food and board.

94
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:47,620
Are you willing?

95
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:55,660
You look thinner.
