"The Secret of Girls"
(Episode 12)

2
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:10,020
So cold.

3
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:18,540
Put it on.

4
00:04:18,541 --> 00:04:19,780
No.

5
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:21,740
It looks so pretty.

6
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,020
Too cold.

7
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:17,260
Put on an apron.

8
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:20,260
Hurry up.

9
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:21,260
Nope.

10
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:33,460
Great.

11
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:06,780
You're done?

12
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:07,500
I'm full.

13
00:06:07,501 --> 00:06:08,980
Take it easy.

14
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:10,860
Clean it up.

15
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:18,740
Hey, Sis Yun.

16
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:27,580
This is so good.

17
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:37,740
Hello.

18
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:41,820
A new concoction.

19
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:42,820
Try it.

20
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:46,660
How is it?

21
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:48,740
It's so strong!

22
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:50,260
How many types did you use?

23
00:06:50,715 --> 00:06:52,475
It doesn't matter what types I use.

24
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,860
You're not sensitive to alcohol.

25
00:06:54,632 --> 00:06:55,032
Qiu Bei.

26
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,100
This is the order for table 6, take a look.

27
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:00,020
Hi, Sis Yun.

28
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,459
Aren't you tired after
taking care of the inn all day?

29
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:03,620
Why do you come here to work?

30
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:05,300
I'm not very tired.

31
00:07:05,475 --> 00:07:06,956
Then, I won't interrupt your conversation.

32
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:08,260
I'll go take care of things.

33
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,380
Hey, what's wrong with you?

34
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:14,819
She is my employee.

35
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:16,420
Why is she working here?

36
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,379
I don't ask her to come here.

37
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:19,740
I don't give her a salary.

38
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:22,180
That makes me even more uncomfortable

39
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:23,980
I still pay her salary.

40
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,580
And she runs to you to work here for free.

41
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:29,460
By the way.

42
00:07:29,461 --> 00:07:31,780
You are the major
shareholder of this bar, right?

43
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:34,460
Working for me for free is
the same as working for you.

44
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,220
That seems to make sense.

45
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,940
So I'm the one who got the advantage.

46
00:07:40,486 --> 00:07:41,486
Yes.

47
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:43,379
She comes here to pick up Wen Shan.

48
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,020
While she's here she helps out with work.

49
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:47,980
But then again...

50
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,740
Ever since Xu Jingxi came,

51
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,740
Wen Shan has become happy.

52
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:53,819
No more sour face.

53
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,060
No more snarky words.

54
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:56,340
To be honest

55
00:07:56,341 --> 00:07:57,860
I'm quite happy for her.

56
00:07:58,420 --> 00:07:59,420
Really?

57
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:00,660
That's great.

58
00:08:01,315 --> 00:08:03,940
But Xu Jingxi said
she'll go back in a few days.

59
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:05,580
To where?

60
00:08:05,619 --> 00:08:06,819
Maybe her hometown.

61
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:08,459
After all, she's lived
in city for a long time.

62
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,380
Unlike us who have settled down here.

63
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:19,660
It's great to be young.

64
00:08:21,755 --> 00:08:22,755
You're young, too.

65
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,140
Qiu Bei.

66
00:08:29,141 --> 00:08:30,620
The guests are starving.

67
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:45,740
Look.

68
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:48,580
Now you don't refuse
physical contact at all.

69
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:52,340
You don't have any reaction
when I hold your hand casually.

70
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,140
Do I need to say thank you?

71
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:56,820
Of course.

72
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,100
Fine, thank you.

73
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:00,260
You are welcome.

74
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:09,300
What's up?

75
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,220
Let's try something else.

76
00:09:13,869 --> 00:09:15,300
Try what?

77
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,620
It seems like hugging is OK.

78
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:53,740
Then my mission is completed.

79
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:56,740
Wen Shan.

80
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:59,380
I'm going to leave.

81
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:05,420
Don't move.

82
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,100
Where are you going?

83
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:11,140
Back home.

84
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,740
I've spent too much time here.

85
00:10:17,526 --> 00:10:18,526
Wen Shan.

86
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:20,700
I hate saying goodbye too.

87
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:24,980
So don't move.

88
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:27,620
Let me hold you a little longer, please.

89
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:35,820
Wen Shan.

90
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,820
I'm so glad to have met you.

91
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:46,660
Me, too.

92
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:50,620
After I'm gone,

93
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:54,260
you have to take care of yourself.

94
00:10:56,499 --> 00:10:57,499
You...

95
00:10:59,546 --> 00:11:00,826
Can you stay here.?

96
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:16,380
Why are you crying like this?

97
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:19,940
No, the weather is too dry.

98
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:22,780
Do you not want to let me go?

99
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:25,900
Just go back.

100
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:26,820
Do you not want to let me go?

101
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:27,820
Go back now.

102
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:36,980
Are you leaving now?

103
00:11:37,005 --> 00:11:38,325
No staying for an extra few days?

104
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:40,059
I can't, something happened at home,

105
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:41,260
I have to go back.

106
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:42,940
OK

107
00:11:42,941 --> 00:11:44,379
Then come next time.

108
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:45,859
You need to come back!

109
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:47,499
I'll miss you.

110
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,180
Go back to work.

111
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:50,900
Bye, be careful.

112
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:59,620
Do you have anything to say to me?

113
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:06,499
Jingxi

114
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,540
I really don't want to let you go.

115
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:13,340
After you're gone, I don't
know when we'll meet again.

116
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:16,259
I got up early to see you off

117
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:17,380
I'm so sleepy.

118
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:18,700
Look at my wrinkles.

119
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:20,436
But it's not as important
as seeing you off.

120
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:22,100
I don't want to leave you either.

121
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:24,780
Thank you for taking care of me.

122
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:26,460
I hope to see you again.

123
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:27,540
It'll definitely happen.

124
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:32,660
You guys.

125
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,940
Don't you want to say anything?

126
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:37,060
I'll go if no.

127
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:42,580
You.

128
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:45,780
While you're being more
proactive in the future,

129
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:48,100
You have to be proactive
with your heart as well.

130
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:07,580
I'm leaving.

131
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:08,980
Take care.

132
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:11,380
Are you not seeing me off?

133
00:13:14,006 --> 00:13:15,246
Do you not want to let me go?

134
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:18,260
Go back.

135
00:13:18,261 --> 00:13:19,379
Do you not want to let me go?

136
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:20,780
Go back
