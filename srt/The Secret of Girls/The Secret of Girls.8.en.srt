"The Secret of Girls"
(Episode 8)

2
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:08,500
Why are you here so late at night?

3
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:12,380
Could it be that my snoring disturbed you?

4
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,460
No.

5
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,179
Ok, you scared me

6
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,619
I thought my snoring was bothering you.

7
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:19,140
You are disturbing me now.

8
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,636
You feel uncomfortable
if you don't say something to me, right?

9
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:22,660
Yes.

10
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,420
I'm always sleepless at night.

11
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:31,740
My mind is in a whirl when I close my eyes.

12
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:36,100
Then I found that watching the moon
can calm me down.

13
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:39,700
Sounds strange.

14
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:45,460
But now after you said.

15
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:48,340
I found that the moon does look pretty.

16
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:51,700
Well, to be honest.

17
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:53,300
Before this

18
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:55,540
I have never looked at
the moon so seriously.

19
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:03,180
I noticed that you are similar to the moon.

20
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:08,180
If you want to praise
my beauty, just say it.

21
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,940
I mean that you are as cold as the moon.

22
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:17,940
Did you see the star next to the moon?

23
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:19,900
The brightest one

24
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:21,660
Venus.

25
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:25,580
If you were the moon

26
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:28,060
I should be the star next to it.

27
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,700
Just like you, a pest that follows.

28
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:35,300
You're killing my vibe.

29
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:40,740
Why did you give your room to them?

30
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:44,020
Did you think they were worth
your pity, just like you at the start,

31
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:45,180
so you helped them...?

32
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:47,500
I didn't think so much.

33
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,860
You need a reason to hurt someone.

34
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:51,916
But you don't need a reason to help someone

35
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:53,300
I helped just because I wanted to.

36
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:56,820
But have you ever thought about
if I didn't let you in?

37
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,859
Where would you go then?

38
00:05:58,860 --> 00:05:59,860
I did think about it.

39
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:02,820
I was thinking about it
when I was in front of your room door.

40
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:04,420
And?

41
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,180
And I realized that of course
you wouldn't, Sister Wen Shan.

42
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,356
You are such a beautiful
and kind person, right?

43
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:12,620
You accepted me once time.

44
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,339
Of course you will take me in for second.

45
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:15,580
Don't give me that.

46
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:20,459
But I made a mistake

47
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:23,460
I didn't expect you to
let me sleep on the floor.

48
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:27,220
Your bed is so big,
why don't you give me half of it?

49
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:29,659
And we've slept together
before, haven't we?

50
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:30,060
I...

51
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:31,700
You what?

52
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:34,260
I don't like physical contact.

53
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:41,180
Got it.

54
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,860
Aren't you going to ask me why?

55
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:49,220
Do you want to tell me?

56
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:50,460
No.

57
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,100
So I won't ask.

58
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,819
Don't you love to ask
"why" a million times?

59
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:56,979
Curious about everything?

60
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:57,980
Always on and on?

61
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:01,980
Everyone has secrets.

62
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:03,460
You have them.

63
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:04,740
Maybe I have them too.

64
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:07,100
If you want to tell me, I'll listen.

65
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,060
If you don't...

66
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:10,660
then I won't ask more.

67
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:13,820
Also.

68
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:16,220
Don't always think that I'm
asking too many questions.

69
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:18,539
I'm just keeping my
curiosity about the world.

70
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:19,740
It's a good thing.

71
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:20,900
Awesome.

72
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:24,700
Thank you.

73
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:27,940
What?

74
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:29,340
Thank you?

75
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:30,220
Did I hear that right?

76
00:07:30,221 --> 00:07:32,180
Sourpuss, you're capable
of saying thank you!

77
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:35,019
I didn't mean thank you...

78
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:37,140
I mean, you should thank me.

79
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,260
Are you crazy? Thank you for what.

80
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:42,099
For not sleeping on the streets.

81
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:44,100
For letting you sleep on the room floor.

82
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:47,100
That seems like you are right.

83
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:51,300
So I really appreciate you,
my beautiful and kind sister Wen Shan.

84
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:54,380
By the way

85
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:57,980
I can go to the police station tomorrow
to pick up my temporary ID card.

86
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:00,380
By then I will have a phone with a SIM card.

87
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:01,380
How about this,

88
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,980
I will be generous this time.

89
00:08:03,275 --> 00:08:04,755
Tomorrow, I'll meet you at the bar.

90
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:05,859
After finishing your shift,

91
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,419
I will treat you to a big meal.

92
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:07,820
How about that?

93
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:08,820
That's nice, right?

94
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:11,420
But...

95
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:13,620
once you get your temporary ID card,

96
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:15,780
when will you head back?

97
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:19,460
Where?

98
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:20,860
Back home.

99
00:08:20,861 --> 00:08:22,100
Or go to work.

100
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:24,500
You have my backup phone.

101
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:26,580
But I've never seen you call your family.

102
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,660
I don't have a family.

103
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:33,460
You really fought with your mom, huh.

104
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:38,420
Yes.

105
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:41,700
I never lied.

106
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:46,380
And I haven't lied to you, either.

107
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:48,860
OK

108
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:50,060
Stay here.

109
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:53,380
What are you saying?

110
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,620
Why does it sound like
you're happy about it?

111
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:58,420
You don't want me to go, right?

112
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,020
You're overthinking.

113
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,620
You just hate to part company with me.

114
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:04,979
If you'd say something
like that you'd die, right?

115
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:05,980
Yes.

116
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,460
So stubborn.

117
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:18,660
So...

118
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:21,220
How long do you plan on sitting
here and watching the moon?

119
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:26,100
Until the moon sets.

120
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:27,900
Then the sun rises.

121
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:33,140
Doesn't that mean I need to
sit here with you for a long time?

122
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,300
You don't have to.

123
00:09:34,301 --> 00:09:35,780
No, I must do it.

124
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:58,740
Hello, boss.

125
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,500
Why are you here today?

126
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:01,900
No Long Island Iced Tea, right?

127
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,259
Of course no, I don't know
how I got home last time.

128
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:05,260
Thank you.

129
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,580
Wen Shan and I carried you back.

130
00:10:09,742 --> 00:10:10,742
You carried me too?

131
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:12,500
How about this,

132
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:15,419
I promised Wen Shan that I would
treat her to dinner after getting off work.

133
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:16,340
Come with us

134
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,780
I want to return the favor.

135
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:22,260
No thanks. Ling Yun is home alone tonight.

136
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:25,020
Okay.

137
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,140
Hi, pretty, let me buy you a drink.

138
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,140
No, thanks.

139
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:29,379
Come on.

140
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:29,980
Take it.

141
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,260
Get off me.

142
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:34,740
Are you crazy?

143
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:36,979
I bought you a drink and wanted to
make a song request. What's with the act?

144
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:37,980
Hey.

145
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:38,780
Excuse me.

146
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:39,220
What happened?

147
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:40,660
I'm the owner.

148
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:42,580
She is just our bar's singer.

149
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:43,620
She doesn't drink.

150
00:10:43,719 --> 00:10:45,019
So what that she's the bar singer?

151
00:10:45,043 --> 00:10:46,883
I bought you a drink, show some respect!

152
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:49,099
How can you earn money without my order?

153
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,220
What are you talking about?

154
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:50,980
I didn't do anything.

155
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:51,980
But you dared to push me.

156
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:53,300
Are you trying to lose your job?

157
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:54,980
How about this then?

158
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:57,339
I'll cover the bill for this table.

159
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:59,220
We came here to have fun.

160
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,140
Don't be unhappy.

161
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:00,780
Right?

162
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,220
I'm unhappy.

163
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:03,300
Look.

164
00:11:03,301 --> 00:11:04,580
She spilled the wine.

165
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:06,459
Then she dare to hit me.

166
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:07,740
You touch me first.

167
00:11:07,772 --> 00:11:08,372
What did you say?

168
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:10,396
Don't think that just because
you're a woman I wont hit you!

169
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:11,300
What are you doing?

170
00:11:11,301 --> 00:11:12,339
You're a man.

171
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:14,300
Are you not ashamed to bully women?

172
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:15,540
Who are you?

173
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:17,219
If you keep going on, I'll beat you up too.

174
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:18,220
You dare!

175
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:20,556
If you keep doing
this, I'll call the police.

176
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:21,860
If you dare start a fight,

177
00:11:21,885 --> 00:11:22,885
I'll...

178
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:25,980
Xu Jingxi！

179
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,260
I didn't touch you!

180
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,300
I didn't touch you.

181
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:30,659
Little girl, don't try to pull a scam.

182
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:32,020
Xu Jingxi.

183
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:36,940
Xu Jingxi.

184
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,100
Xu Jingxi.

185
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:40,860
Xu Jingxi.

186
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,220
Xu Jingxi, wake up.

187
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,020
Where are we going?

188
00:11:55,021 --> 00:11:56,500
Aren't we at the bar?

189
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:57,700
You just fainted.

190
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:58,700
Don't you remember?

191
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,060
I was drunk.

192
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,500
I can't remember.

193
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:10,980
Did you pretend to faint?

194
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:13,260
You found out.

195
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:14,740
Am I a good actress?

196
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:21,699
I was just kidding

197
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,100
I really fainted.

198
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:25,900
Don't be worried

199
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:27,980
I've said that I would treat you to a meal.

200
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:31,260
So I came with an empty stomach.

201
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:33,260
I guess I was hungry.

202
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:34,899
Anyway, think about it.

203
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,580
That man was so fierce just now.

204
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:38,300
I was scared.

205
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:40,620
I was scared and hungry.

206
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:42,740
I fainted when I got excited.

207
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:45,460
If you were scared, why
didn't you hide in the back?

208
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:47,860
But he wanted to hit you.

209
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:49,300
You were scared of him hitting me?

210
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:51,580
I was scared of him touching you.

211
00:12:53,932 --> 00:12:56,492
Can you protect yourself
when you get into trouble in the future?

212
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:57,620
I know.

213
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:00,380
Let's go to the restaurant for a big meal.

214
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:03,580
Okay.

215
00:13:03,767 --> 00:13:04,367
Mr. Driver.

216
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,140
We're not going to the hospital.

217
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,380
So where are we going?

218
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:09,380
You decide.

219
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:11,220
What do you want to eat?

220
00:13:12,035 --> 00:13:12,755
BBQ?

221
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:14,140
Hot pot?

222
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:16,380
Xu Jingxi?

223
00:13:17,067 --> 00:13:18,067
Xu Jingxi?
