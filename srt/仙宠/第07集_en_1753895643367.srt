00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
impairment

2
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:11,140
!!!

3
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,520
My heart is not convinced

4
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:09,120
Even if the whole world ends, I will not give up

5
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:16,520
Passing through the door, I can't help but read the books of fortune

6
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:24,360
Even if the whole world is not convinced, I don't ask where I am going

7
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
The Long Ballad

8
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Episode 16

9
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Li...Li Xiao?

10
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Juanjuan?

11
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
You...Why are you here?

12
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Teacher Li, I'm sorry. I just made your clothes dirty.

13
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Now it's already washed. I'll put it here for you.

14
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
By the way, are my clothes still fit for you?

15
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Everything is fine. Thank you.

16
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Juan...Juanjuan?

17
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
What should we eat for lunch?

18
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I heard that the newly opened Wang's restaurant has really good food.

19
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I heard that too!

20
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
There's crab noodles, rice cakes, fried pork, and roasted chicken.

21
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Juanjuan, let's go to the restaurant today.

22
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Then...

23
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
That restaurant needs to make an appointment one day in advance.

24
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I'm afraid today...

25
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
If you want to eat, I'll go to the restaurant.

26
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I think we can eat today.

27
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Why do you have to go to the restaurant to eat?

28
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I cured the backache of Boss Wang.

29
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
He said that if I wanted to go, there would be a place for me.

30
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'm sorry.

31
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
You even cured Boss Wang's backache?

32
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
It's all arranged by the cat army.

33
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Then what are you waiting for? Let's go now!

34
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
You guys go. I suddenly remembered that I have something to do.

35
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I won't go.

36
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Juanjuan, wait.

37
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Did you guys notice that Juanjuan's attitude towards the little girl is strange recently?

38
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Is it?

39
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Yes.

40
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I always feel that Juanjuan is deliberately hiding from Li Xiang.

41
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
If you say so...

42
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
It's strange.

43
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Could it be that the little girl is upset about what she did?

44
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I told you that this little girl can't be favored for a long time.

45
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I understand.

46
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
The High Immortal Society must be like this because...

47
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Because I'm the one that the High Immortal likes the most!

48
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Don't kiss my ear!

49
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
The High Immortal likes me the most!

50
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Me!

51
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
You go and see if you can get rid of me.

52
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I'm not going to let you go.

53
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Me!

54
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
You guys are stupid. I can't explain it to you.

55
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Shu Juanjuan, what are you thinking about?

56
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
What are you thinking about?

57
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
You...

58
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Why are you here?

59
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I'll pour you some tea.

60
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
No, thanks.

61
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I can do it myself. You go ahead.

62
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Juanjuan, have I done anything that made you unhappy recently?

63
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
No. You're overthinking it.

64
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
You're thinking too much.

65
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
If I'm not, why are you always avoiding me?

66
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I'm not avoiding you. I'm just busy with my business.

67
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
But you're obviously...

68
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Is the Taoist priest in this land for an examination?

69
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Yes, but the Taoist priest isn't here.

70
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
When will the Taoist priest come back?

71
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
My young master has a strange illness and is waiting for his help.

72
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Li Xiao, go and take a look.

73
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
After all, life is short and it's very urgent.

74
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I'll go and take a look.

75
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Young Master Yuan has a strange illness.

76
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
The doctors nearby have asked for help.

77
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
They just can't find out where the needle is.

78
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Our madam is in a bad mood.

79
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
This way, please.

80
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
This is good. I've been waiting for you.

81
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Young Master Yuan has a new life.

82
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
May I ask if the master of your family is Master Ning Kui?

83
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
You know our master?

84
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I've heard about your master.

85
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
He's a hero in the battle of the gods.

86
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
After the death of Master Yuan,

87
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Madam didn't want Master Yuan's descendants to be separated.

88
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Master Yuan was only eight years old.

89
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Fortunately, the King of Nanjing still cares about Master Yuan.

90
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
He didn't care about his old mother.

91
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Master Ning died for the people.

92
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Everyone will remember him.

93
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Are you okay, Li Xiao?

94
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I'm fine.

95
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I'm fine.

96
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
This mortal crow

97
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
will die in the yard again.

98
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
It's so bad.

99
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Do crows often fall into the yard?

100
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Yes, they do.

101
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
If the Yi family is in bad luck,

102
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
even these animals will come to us.

103
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Madam put all her hopes on Young Master Yuan.

104
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
But now, even Young Master Yuan has fallen.

105
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Master Li, we're here.

106
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Madam, I've brought Master Li here.

107
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Master Li, please save Xiao.

108
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Quanzi has been in bed for two months.

109
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
He's been out of energy.

110
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
He's been too tired from studying.

111
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I gave him some tonic.

112
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
He thought he'd be fine after a good rest.

113
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
He's getting weaker and weaker.

114
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
He hasn't even woken up recently.

115
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I don't know if you have records

116
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
of his daily meals.

117
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I'd like to know more.

118
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Yes, please wait.

119
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Wait.

120
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
This painting is quite interesting.

121
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
An'er painted this.

122
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
This child didn't focus on studying,

123
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
but painted these useless things.

124
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Master Li.

125
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Oh.

126
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Is An'er's illness curable?

127
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
It's indeed a bit urgent.

128
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I'll prescribe a prescription.

129
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Okay, please come this way.

130
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Master Li, you have a strange taste.

131
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
This painting is of high quality.

132
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
This is a gift from my late husband,

133
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
a gift for my son.

134
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I heard it's a rare painting.

135
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I don't know much about women.

136
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
But I like An'er.

137
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Master Hua is Prince Nanjing's wife, Hua Feng Yu?

138
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Yes.

139
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
My husband died in the battlefield.

140
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Master Hua took his body back.

141
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I had no choice but to disband Ning's family.

142
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
He was the one who comforted everyone.

143
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I see.

144
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
The prescription is ready.

145
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
May I stay here tonight

146
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
to observe your illness at any time?

147
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I'm so looking forward to it.

148
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Come and prepare a guest room for Master Li.

149
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Li Xiao hasn't come back yet?

150
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Why should we care about him?

151
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
We should eat what we want.

152
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Juanjuan, send a message to him.

153
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Ask him if he will come back for dinner.

154
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
No, thanks.

155
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
He's a big man.

156
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
He can't starve.

157
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
That's right.

158
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Juanjuan,

159
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
although he looks mature,

160
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
he was a little bird a few days ago.

161
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
If he was abducted by some other immortals,

162
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
you'll regret it.

163
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
He didn't even reply to his message.

164
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
What did you say?

165
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
He didn't get abducted.

166
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
He's not that stupid.

167
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I'm afraid he's in trouble in the patient's family.

168
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
What trouble?

169
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I just found out that

170
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
the young master Ning he went to see today

171
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
was the son of the head of the Ning family

172
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
who died in the battle of the Holy Land ten years ago.

173
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I heard that young master Ning's illness is strange.

174
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
The demon god has been active frequently recently.

175
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
The ghost grass is also in the market.

176
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
But don't be involved with the demon god.

177
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Where are you going?

178
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I suddenly remembered that I have something to do.

179
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
You guys eat first.

180
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Don't wait for us.

181
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
We?

182
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
It should be here.

183
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Mianmian is right.

184
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
He's still a little bird.

185
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
It's normal for me to be a little worried

186
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
that he won't come home so late.

187
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
And the demon god has been active frequently recently.

188
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I think

189
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
it's my duty to go out and look around.

190
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I'll take a peek later.

191
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
He's safe and sound.

192
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I'll leave.

193
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Yes, that's it.

194
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Stupid.

195
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Is there really a skeleton in this house?

196
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Disappeared.

197
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Master Li, please have some tea.

198
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Thank you, madam.

199
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Please take care of my son's business.

200
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
You're welcome.

201
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I'll do my best.

202
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Lin Xiang!

203
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Xuanjuan?

204
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Say, how much of your body

205
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
has been broken this month?

206
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Why isn't there any improvement?

207
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Enough, get ready.

208
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Don't be rude in front of the guests.

209
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I'm sorry to let you two laugh at me.

210
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Madam Li, I was careless today.

211
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I didn't send a message to Li's Mansion

212
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
to tell you that Master Li is going to stay here.

213
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Madam Li was worried about finding you.

214
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Why are you pretending to be your wife?

215
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
You rushed in so erratically.

216
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I can't say that you're my master.

217
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I'm afraid someone here is going to hurt me.

218
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
It's getting late.

219
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
You two can stay here.

220
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I've already ordered someone to arrange a room for you.

221
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
A room?

222
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
No, no, no.

223
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
No need.

224
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I don't want to share a room with him.

225
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
It's common for a couple to talk.

226
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
They fight and get together.

227
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Mr. Li is a man of great affection.

228
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Mrs. Li, you should trust him more.

229
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Thank you for your concern.

230
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I didn't do well enough.

231
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
This way, please.

232
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
It was an emergency.

233
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
So...

234
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I know.

235
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
You don't need to explain.

236
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Have some snacks.

237
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
No, thanks.

238
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I remember you don't like walnuts.

239
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I'll get them for you.

240
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I don't want walnuts.

241
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I'll get them for you, okay?

242
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Is this okay?

243
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Why are you here?

244
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
It's...

245
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
It's Mianmian who asked me to find you to eat.

246
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
You're the same.

247
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
You need to tell me if you don't want to go home.

248
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I'm worried about you.

249
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
A letter?

250
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
What letter?

251
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I forgot you're a little brat who knows nothing.

252
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I felt a little hot just now.

253
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
It's because of the letter.

254
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Here, take it.

255
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
You can keep it like this.

256
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I'm sorry, Li Xiao.

257
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I shouldn't have obsessed you before.

258
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Then why did you형 you abduct me?

259
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
than sent you into this?

260
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
You're like an old friend of mine.

261
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
What's wrong?

262
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
It's strange.

263
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Your appearance and voice are not like him.

264
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
But when I see you, I will think of him.

265
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
So I don't know how to face you.

266
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Is it the young master that Xiaosi has been looking for?

267
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
It's been so many years.

268
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Have you ever thought that he might have...

269
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
No.

270
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I won't give up.

271
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
By the way, what disease does young master Ning have?

272
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
It's not a disease.

273
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
It's poison.

274
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Poison?

275
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
It's penetrating through the skin.

276
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
This poison is very delicate and secretive.

277
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Young master Ning's right hand is slightly red, but his left hand is not.

278
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,000
It means that the poison penetrates through the body at a very slow speed from the right hand.

279
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
So the poison should be hidden in the items he often uses.

280
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
The poison is slowly destroying young master Ning's foundation.

281
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:16,000
But because the poison is weak and very rare, it will not be noticed.

282
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Who is so vicious?

283
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
It should be someone who is familiar with young master Ning.

284
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
How do you know?

285
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I know young master Ning's hobby and daily habits.

286
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
That's why I have the opportunity to put such a slow poison.

287
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
And only those who are familiar with each other will be afraid of people finding out.

288
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
There are not many people who come to Ning's mansion.

289
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I believe the real murderer is not difficult to find out.

290
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Can you cure this poison?

291
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Young master Ning has been poisoned for a while.

292
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I'm not sure.

293
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
And...

294
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
What?

295
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I also found some strange things.

296
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Strange things?

297
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I stayed here for this matter.

298
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Let's wait and see.

299
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Tonight, there may be a harvest.

300
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Chinese medicine.

301
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Stop..

302
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:56,100
ans my

303
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Juejue, don't hurt her!

304
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:12,500
You...

305
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Why are you...

306
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Don't hurt Xiao Hui.

307
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
She just wants to save me.

308
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I'm not a king within three days.

309
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Xiao Hui.

310
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Xiao Hui.

311
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Xiao Hui.

312
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Xiao Hui.

313
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Xiao Hui.

314
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Xiao Hui.

315
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Xiao Hui.

316
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Xiao Hui.

317
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Xiao Hui.

318
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Xiao Hui.

319
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Xiao Hui.

320
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Xiao Hui.

321
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Xiao Hui.

322
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Xiao Hui.

323
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Xiao Hui.

324
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Xiao Hui.

325
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Xiao Hui.

326
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Xiao Hui.

327
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Xiao Hui.

328
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Xiao Hui.

329
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Xiao Hui.

330
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Xiao Hui.

331
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Xiao Hui.

332
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Xiao Hui.

333
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Xiao Hui.

334
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Xiao Hui.

335
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Xiao Hui.

336
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Xiao Hui.

337
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Xiao Hui.

338
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Xiao Hui.

339
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Xiao Hui.

340
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Xiao Hui.

341
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Xiao Hui.

342
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Xiao Hui.

343
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Xiao Hui.

344
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Xiao Hui.

345
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Xiao Hui.

346
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Xiao Hui.

347
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Xiao Hui.

348
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Xiao Hui.

349
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Xiao Hui.

350
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Xiao Hui.

351
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Xiao Hui.

352
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Xiao Hui.

353
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Xiao Hui.

354
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Xiao Hui.

355
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Xiao Hui.

356
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Xiao Hui.

357
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Xiao Hui.

358
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Xiao Hui.

359
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Xiao Hui.

360
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Xiao Hui.

361
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Xiao Hui.

362
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Xiao Hui.

363
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Xiao Hui.

364
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Xiao Hui.

365
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Xiao Hui.
