1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I can't live without you

2
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I can't live without you

3
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I can't live without you

4
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I can't live without you

5
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I can't live without you

6
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I can't live without you

7
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I can't live without you

8
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I can't live without you

9
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I can't live without you

10
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I can't live without you

11
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

12
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Episode 16

13
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
That fox is shaking.

14
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Say it.

15
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
You've become a red-skinned woman.

16
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
The scholars are very experienced.

17
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
They asked

18
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Why are you here alone in the middle of the night?

19
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I only heard the woman's voice.

20
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I've always liked the scent of books.

21
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I know you're here alone to study.

22
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I'm here to accompany you.

23
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
The scholars are very happy.

24
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Please enter the house immediately.

25
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
What's next?

26
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Listen to the next part.

27
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
What is it?

28
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
What is it?

29
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Professor

30
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Why does the fox always seduce scholars?

31
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
There are eight in ten plays.

32
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Seduction of scholars is the destiny of foxes.

33
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Must be completed

34
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Is there any benefit to completing destiny?

35
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Yes

36
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Once the destiny is completed

37
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
The fox's cultivation can be very fast.

38
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
What about the hair?

39
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Can you be more straight?

40
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I think the cultivation is here.

41
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Everything is as good as it is.

42
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Wow, do you know where the scholars are?

43
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Here it is.

44
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
This is a good place to study.

45
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I know you're here alone in the middle of the night.

46
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I only heard the woman's voice.

47
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I only heard the woman's voice.

48
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
What is it?

49
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
What?

50
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
You are a good student.

51
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
If you go somewhere

52
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I'm here to accompany you.

53
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I only heard the woman's voice.

54
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I only heard the woman's voice.

55
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,600
and invite me to your room right away.

56
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,560
Why do I need to be happy?

57
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,520
Isn't it all about happiness when I'm a student?

58
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,480
Why is it that I should be happy

59
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,600
when I'm a student?

60
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:08,880
Well...

61
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,320
Why don't you follow the script?

62
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,320
The script?

63
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,560
Are you too hungry

64
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,680
to say it?

65
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,720
I'm not.

66
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,200
Come in first.

67
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,600
It's a little cold.

68
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,600
Have some ginger.

69
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,560
It's late at night.

70
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,000
Why are you here alone?

71
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,440
I like the smell of books and...

72
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,440
Where are your family?

73
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,720
They're all dead.

74
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,920
Where do you live?

75
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,080
Far away, on the mountain.

76
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,080
I live with my master.

77
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,080
When you're done eating,

78
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,320
I'll take you to see my master.

79
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,480
No, I won't.

80
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,560
I sneaked out.

81
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,760
If my master finds out,

82
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,760
he'll punish me for doing this and that again.

83
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,240
Your master is not good to you?

84
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,200
He saw me wandering around alone,

85
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,040
so he insisted on taking me as his disciple.

86
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,600
He kept saying that

87
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,680
the Heavens would give me a big task,

88
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,760
and I would make a big trouble if I didn't work hard.

89
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,000
But he didn't teach me anything.

90
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,800
If he only

91
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,560
works on firewood,

92
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,120
water, cooking and cleaning every day,

93
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,680
what kind of person would teach me?

94
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,560
I like the smell of books and...

95
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,880
I'll take you to see my master tomorrow.

96
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,880
I'll ask him if he can let you stay.

97
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,880
...learn the skills of the study tomorrow.

98
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,880
I'm here to stay...

99
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,880
Why am I here?

100
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,960
Didn't you say you wanted to learn the skills of the study with me?

101
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,280
You've eaten the steamed buns.

102
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,400
It's too late to regret.

103
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,000
You don't take girls in the academy?

104
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,200
When you see my master,

105
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,600
you have to pretend to be a man.

106
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,600
Mr. Shu.

107
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,600
Wei Li has told me that

108
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,000
if you have nowhere to go,

109
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,400
you can stay.

110
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,400
Thank... Thank you, Mr. Shu.

111
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,800
As for the study,

112
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,600
you probably don't have money to pay.

113
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,200
Then you can clean it every day.

114
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,000
What?

115
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,200
I have to work?

116
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,600
This is different from what you said.

117
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,800
It's okay. I'll help you.

118
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,200
All of them?

119
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,400
At last.

120
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,240
and lost your parents,

121
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,000
and you don't remember your last name.

122
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,520
I wonder if you are willing to name me Shu.

123
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,440
Shu?

124
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,120
What does that mean?

125
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,760
It means to expand the book exhibition.

126
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,560
Is it possible to expand the book exhibition?

127
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:08,840
I'm willing to!

128
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:09,960
Good.

129
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,200
From now on,

130
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,280
Shu Juanjuan

131
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,560
is my student at the Book Museum of Mount Yi.

132
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:21,400
It's not easy to learn and practice.

133
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,480
Sir,

134
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,280
why do we have to study?

135
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,240
Study?

136
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,680
To cultivate our families

137
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,760
and rule the country.

138
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,440
Rule the country?

139
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,840
Does that mean

140
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,280
we can be generals after studying?

141
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,920
Maybe we can really

142
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,960
be generals in the future.

143
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,400
Wei Li,

144
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,960
are you not going back this Mid-Autumn Festival?

145
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:54,960
It's a long way home.

146
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:55,800
I'd better not go.

147
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,360
Your family members are really...

148
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,720
It's rare to see you together.

149
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,360
I should have sent you a letter.

150
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,080
They are busy.

151
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:03,800
I can't take care of them.

152
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,720
Take care.

153
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,360
I'll bring you the apples I planted.

154
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,840
You're so funny.

155
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,360
Don't worry.

156
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,520
The medicine will be fine soon.

157
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:26,800
Senior,

158
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,120
are you writing letters

159
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,920
for your family members?

160
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,200
Speaking of which,

161
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,440
I've never seen you

162
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,760
contact your family members.

163
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:36,920
What about you?

164
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,320
It's been a year.

165
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,000
You're not going back to your master?

166
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,640
I haven't finished my studies yet.

167
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:46,920
All right.

168
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,200
Sir.

169
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,800
Mid-Autumn Festival is coming.

170
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,560
I've brought you some mooncakes.

171
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,600
Thank you, sir.

172
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:11,960
Senior,

173
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,600
that was made of lotus seeds.

174
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,640
What is this?

175
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:18,680
It was picked by Burnilin.

176
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,360
Their seeds are reallyadezoid!

177
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,720
They're fresh

178
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,480
and delicious.

179
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,200
Really?

180
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,120
Yes.

181
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,520
Let me taste the mooncakes.

182
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,600
Due to their Good luck,

183
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,040
they'll be put in tables and chairs.

184
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,320
Let me taste one for you, Jue.

185
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,160
Okay.

186
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,920
You third age member,

187
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,240
tall one.

188
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,440
What is Mid-Autumn Festival?

189
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,040
I know.

190
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,280
It's

191
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,480
a good day to celebrate Mid-Autumn Festival.

192
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,440
Mid-Autumn Festival

193
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,280
is the day of reunion.

194
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,720
Then, won't you go back

195
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,960
to reunite with your family?

196
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,760
Family?

197
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,040
Maybe,

198
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:08,840
in their heart,

199
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,080
I'm not a family anymore.

200
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:12,640
Yes.

201
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:15,560
Take it.

202
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:16,800
I'll be back soon.

203
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,440
Little scholar.

204
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:28,960
Good.

205
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:38,560
Qunjue,

206
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:39,960
what are you doing?

207
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,240
Oh, no.

208
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,800
Not this one.

209
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,480
You should see

210
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,880
why you are here

211
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,840
at midnight.

212
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:53,960
Then,

213
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,040
why are you here

214
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,800
at midnight?

215
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,120
I've been enjoying the festival since I was a child.

216
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,600
I'm here alone to celebrate Mid-Autumn Festival.

217
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,960
I'm here to accompany you.

218
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,080
I'm afraid that

219
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,560
you're not a good match for me.

220
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,600
That's easy.

221
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,360
If you marry me,

222
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,080
we'll be a family.

223
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:20,720
You...

224
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:21,640
You...

225
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Where did you learn

226
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,240
this nonsense?

227
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,200
It's said in books.

228
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,880
A couple is a couple.

229
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,120
We're a family.

230
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:37,840
I accept the gift.

231
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,880
It's too late to regret.

232
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,080
Senior.

233
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,600
I heard that

234
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,120
Mid-Autumn Festival is tomorrow.

235
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:48,640
Let's go and have fun.

236
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,080
Senior.

237
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:08,560
Wow...

238
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:11,720
Okay.

239
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,880
Yuping Xihuan 1st Theater

240
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,320
She'll agitated and недcity

241
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,480
and pass out

242
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,120
powiedział

243
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,040
If you don't get along with her

244
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,760
If you get along with her

245
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,600
I will put a stop to her

246
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,240
Ten thousand

247
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:54,960
Ten thousand

248
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,640
Is that a hundred thousand?

249
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:57,920
No

250
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,260
Scholars

251
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,360
Don't pay a lot of attention to her

252
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:00,920
Mother

253
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,240
It's different

254
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,280
You're a woman

255
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:05,560
Moral

256
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,240
Moral

257
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,240
The w一起

258
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,000
Juan Juan!

259
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,600
Behave yourself!

260
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,320
Senior!

261
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,600
Just die!

262
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,000
Juan Juan!

263
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,880
Senior! Senior Wei Li!

264
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,440
Enough, Hu Yao.

265
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,480
If you have anything to say,

266
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,600
just say it.

267
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,320
You...

268
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,480
You...

269
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,480
You...

270
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,280
What... What a powerful demon power!

271
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:57,760
Everyone,

272
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,680
let's capture it together!

273
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,800
sex you!

274
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,800
XuanXuan

275
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,700
Jutsu

276
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,640
It can not be

277
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:31,780
Run

278
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:37,460
Get the upgrade! Jutsu

279
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,800
Jun Jun, stop!

280
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,800
Stop!

281
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,800
Jun Jun!

282
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,800
Senior Wei Li...

283
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,800
Jun Jun...

284
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:04,800
No...

285
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,800
No...

286
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,800
Wei... Wei Li... Senior...

287
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,800
Episode 11

288
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,800
This is...

289
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,800
Feng Shou Ling?

290
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,800
I'm back?

291
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,800
Master!

292
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,800
Where's Senior Wei Li?

293
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,800
The scholar is safe now.

294
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,800
He's back in the academy.

295
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:50,800
Thank you for saving him.

296
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,800
I hurt him, right?

297
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,800
I've never hurt anyone.

298
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,800
Why did they want to catch me?

299
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,800
I just wanted to protect Senior Wei Li.

300
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,800
Why did it turn out like this?

301
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:06,800
I asked you to train me.

302
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,800
I just wanted to protect you.

303
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,800
No, I have to go see him.

304
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,800
You can't control your power yet.

305
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,800
You're going to see him like this?

306
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,800
Aren't you afraid of being re-invaded?

307
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:24,800
Humans and demons have red collars when they're born.

308
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:30,800
Only by training hard can you achieve your goal.

309
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:36,800
I'm sorry for not saying goodbye to Senior Wei Li.

310
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,800
I'll go train with Master.

311
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,800
You probably already know that I'm a fox demon.

312
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,800
You must be shocked.

313
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,800
Master said that I'm too weak

314
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,800
and can't control my power.

315
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,800
I'm sorry.

316
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,800
I wonder if you'll blame me

317
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:00,800
or if you'll be willing to be my friend.

318
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,800
Master said that humans and demons have red collars when they're born.

319
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,800
Only by training hard can you achieve your goal.

320
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,800
I'll definitely work hard to train

321
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,800
so that I can reunite with you again.

322
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,800
The spring flowers on the mountain have bloomed.

323
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,800
They're very pretty.

324
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,800
I wonder if the flowers in the academy are as beautiful as before.

325
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,800
This summer is later than usual.

326
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,800
I wonder if the wind in the academy is as cool as before.

327
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,800
It's the end of the year again.

328
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:39,800
I wonder if anyone will eat moon cakes with you this year.

329
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:46,800
Senior, I've been thinking about you lately.

330
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,800
You taught me how to write, taught me how to recite books,

331
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,800
and even married me your meat.

332
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:57,800
I wonder if you'll think of me too.

333
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,800
I'm sorry.

334
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,800
I'm sorry.

335
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,800
I'm sorry.

336
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,800
Shu Quan Quan!

337
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,800
You heartless little fox!

338
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,800
You even knew to come back?

339
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,800
You...

340
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,800
knew I was a girl?

341
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,800
You clearly are a girl.

342
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,800
How could I not know?

343
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:49,800
Then how did you know I was...

344
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,800
Wei Li was able to cover your tail back then.

345
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,800
It took a lot of effort.

346
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,800
Senior, he knew about it.

347
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:01,800
If that's the case, why did you...

348
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,800
Why didn't he expose you?

349
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,800
Because I wanted to try.

350
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:13,800
If I could use the words of a saint to call the demon and not follow the evil path.

351
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,800
I wonder if I'll succeed.

352
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:23,800
Your teachings will surely be remembered forever.

353
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,800
Wait for me!

354
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,800
I'm not here anymore.

355
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:43,800
After you disappeared, Wei Li couldn't find you anywhere.

356
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,800
He was unable to sleep.

357
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:51,800
Until one day, he told me to leave the academy.

358
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:55,800
No matter where you are, I must find you.

359
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:59,800
Your letter was that he had already left.

360
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:03,800
After that, I didn't have any news of him anymore.

361
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,800
Wei Li came from afar.

362
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,800
I'm so happy!

363
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,800
I'm so happy!

364
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:32,800
Li Xiao...

365
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,800
I'm so happy!

366
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,800
I'm so happy!

367
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,800
I'm so happy!

368
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,800
I'm so happy!

369
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,800
I'm so happy!

370
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,800
I'm so happy!

371
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,800
I'm so happy!

372
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,800
I'm so happy!

373
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,800
I'm so happy!

374
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,800
I'm so happy!

375
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,800
I'm so happy!

376
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,800
I'm so happy!

377
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,800
I'm so happy!

378
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,800
I'm so happy!

379
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,800
I'm so happy!

380
