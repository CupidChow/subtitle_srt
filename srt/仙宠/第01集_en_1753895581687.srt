I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

32
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,320
D 될espère đo aggregation

33
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,320
I'll drink with Kaikou some other day.

34
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,320
Third Master is driving us away.

35
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:02,320
The bride is already waiting for us.

36
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,320
If he accuses us in front of Mr. Lin,

37
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,320
we'll be worried.

38
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,320
That's right.

39
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,320
Just kidding.

40
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,320
Let's go with the bride.

41
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,320
We won't disturb you.

42
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,320
That's right.

43
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,320
My lady,

44
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:28,320
I'm blessed to marry you.

45
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,320
Don't worry.

46
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,320
I'll be good to you.

47
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:34,320
You won't lie to me?

48
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,320
I swear

49
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,320
I won't lie to you.

50
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,320
If this matter happens,

51
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,320
I'll be killed.

52
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,320
Why do you take it seriously?

53
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,320
I believe you.

54
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:49,320
But I don't want you to be killed.

55
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,320
I'm not the one who's lying.

56
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,320
I'm just a woman.

57
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,320
But, Third Master,

58
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,320
why don't you wear

59
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,320
the jade-like handkerchief I embroidered for you?

60
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,320
My lady,

61
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:04,320
when did you give me the jade-like handkerchief?

62
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,320
You said that jade-like handkerchief

63
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,320
was a love token I embroidered myself.

64
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,320
You wanted to wear it every day.

65
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,320
Now you've forgotten it.

66
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,320
My lady, don't joke.

67
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,320
The love token you gave me

68
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,320
is a jade pendant with white coins and silver.

69
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,320
I wear it every day.

70
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:22,320
You don't like the jade-like handkerchief.

71
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,320
Since you don't like it,

72
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,320
why did you lie to me that you like it?

73
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,320
You lied to me that you'd marry me

74
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,320
if you were to marry me.

75
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:35,320
You lied to me that you had no feelings for

76
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:38,320
that lady from the Lin family.

77
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,320
How could you?

78
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,320
You lied to me that I was waiting for you

79
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,320
at the lotus pond.

80
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,320
You said you wanted to take me away.

81
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,320
You're Xiu...

82
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,320
Xiu'er!

83
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,320
You don't recognize me?

84
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,320
Oh, right.

85
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:57,320
How could Xiu'er have such a smooth skin?

86
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:01,320
Xiu'er's face should be like this.

87
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,320
This is the right way.

88
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,320
Look.

89
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:07,320
Now you can recognize Xiu'er.

90
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,320
Don't come over.

91
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,320
Don't worry, San Lang.

92
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,320
Xiu'er is joking with you.

93
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,320
I'm afraid that she didn't lose it.

94
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,320
Isn't she right there?

95
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,320
I'm sorry, San Lang.

96
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,320
I was wrong.

97
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,320
It was my fault.

98
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,320
Please spare my life.

99
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:36,320
San Lang said he'd spend the rest of his life with me.

100
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,320
Xiu'er is here to pick you up.

101
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,320
Take your time.

102
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,320
Don't be so anxious.

103
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,320
Who is it?

104
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:00,320
Get out of my body.

105
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,320
If you behave,

106
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,320
I'll be kind and give you a good beating.

107
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:18,320
She was bullied by me.

108
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,320
She's the one who killed me.

109
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,320
She deserves to die.

110
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,320
Don't play the dirty trick.

111
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,320
You're not the poor Xiu'er.

112
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,320
You're not the unlucky bride.

113
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,320
You're just a girl who likes to take advantage of others' bodies

114
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,320
and play with people's hearts.

115
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:38,320
Am I right, Shen Yao?

116
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,320
You're so far away.

117
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,320
Do you know that now...

118
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:46,320
I'm going to die with this body.

119
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,320
If you take me out,

120
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,320
you'll be buried with this little lady.

121
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,320
Then I'll give it a try.

122
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,320
Hong Ling, roll your hair.

123
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,320
If you don't pull it out, you'll have to dry your mouth.

124
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,320
You're Nanjing's soil.

125
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,320
You're the heaven.

126
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,320
Hong I'm tired.

127
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,320
Lay off your sword.

128
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,320
Bo Yuncheng...

129
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,720
That was just a trick set by the demon.

130
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,520
Xiu'er is dead.

131
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,120
She won't come to you again.

132
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,320
Xiu'er is back.

133
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,920
Xiu'er...

134
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,520
Step aside!

135
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,720
I have a report to make!

136
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,320
Commander!

137
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,920
A female corpse was found in the pond!

138
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,720
Li Jian is here!

139
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,120
Li Jian!

140
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,720
Someone has reported that you killed the woman of the Liang family, Wu Xiu'er!

141
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,120
Come with us!

142
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,120
Take her away!

143
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,120
Yes!

144
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,520
But...

145
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:20,720
Thank you for your mercy, my poor granddaughter.

146
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,520
God has opened his eyes.

147
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,120
That evil woman betrayed me.

148
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:30,120
My poor Xiu'er, you can rest in peace now.

149
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,720
That's it?

150
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,920
Another false accusation is the truth.

151
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:50,120
I only saw that woman of the land...

152
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,320
No, no, no.

153
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,920
The Heaven Dog is the first!

154
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:56,320
The red embroidery is gone in the moonlight!

155
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,320
I was just going to investigate Wu Xiu'er's case.

156
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,120
I didn't expect to catch a demon.

157
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,320
Why would the demon set Li San Lang on fire?

158
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:07,320
Maybe it was when Wu Xiu'er died in the lotus pond.

159
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,320
The demon hid you in the water.

160
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:12,320
I think he found a way to make you happy.

161
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:16,320
Then didn't Li San Lang buy the government's property and cover up his crimes?

162
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:19,320
Why would he still let the government arrest him?

163
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:23,320
Oh, the county magistrate is not smart.

164
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:26,320
I gently reminded him a few words.

165
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,320
Juanjuan, fire!

166
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,320
This time, it will be fine.

167
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,320
It's done!

168
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,320
I've been dreaming of a straight hair.

169
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,320
This damn curly hair!

170
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,320
I don't know why!

171
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,320
What's wrong with curly hair?

172
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,320
You think curly hair looks good.

173
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,320
You're the god of Heaven Dog, but you're a role model for our Fox Clan.

174
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,320
Back then, the God of Heaven and Earth fought hard to kill the gods.

175
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,320
You're a god of martial arts.

176
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,320
Now you're here, you're a god of heaven and earth.

177
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:12,320
Now you're here to protect the world, you're a role model for our Fox Clan.

178
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,320
They say the war in the past ten years has caused the earth to collapse.

179
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:20,320
But the Demon God is such a weak demon.

180
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,320
Why would he make such a big trouble?

181
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:26,320
You've only been a god of the world for a few years.

182
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,320
Of course you don't know.

183
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:33,320
That's because the god of the Demon God got something incredible.

184
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,320
The medicine is here.

185
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:42,320
Cheng'er, you should go to the pharmacy instead of the southern border.

186
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:47,320
This is the new medicine that the god of heaven and earth made for you.

187
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,320
It's the most effective against the damage.

188
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,320
Mianmian, I'm hungry.

189
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,320
Mianmian, water.

190
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,320
Mianmian, my clothes are dirty. Help me wash them.

191
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:02,320
Wash clothes, cook, cook, plant vegetables.

192
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,320
I do all the dirty work.

193
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,320
You're not even Mianmian.

194
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,320
Today, Mianmian will be even more beautiful.

195
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,320
Mianmian.

196
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,320
The midnight palace is indeed a bit short of people.

197
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,320
Cat Lord, how about...

198
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:19,320
Last month, the seventh day, I thought the boss of Tianbao Pavilion was robbing the people.

199
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,320
When I saved people, I damaged the precious antique.

200
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:27,320
The third day of the first month, the snake monster burned the gold of the Wang family's clothing.

201
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,320
And the last day...

202
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,320
Enough, enough, enough.

203
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,320
Isn't it just washing clothes and cooking?

204
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,320
I can do it myself.

205
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,320
If you're really in a hurry to use people,

206
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,320
like us, the immortals,

207
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,320
the moon is low or dead.

208
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,320
You can take it.

209
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,320
You're so smart that you don't even bother to bother yourself.

210
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,320
But there's one thing.

211
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,320
Please know that...

212
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,320
One contribution is not enough to feed a cat.

213
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,320
Bao!

214
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,320
Come in.

215
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,320
Immortal, I heard that there's a bad bird that hurts people near Shangshui Village.

216
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,320
A bad bird?

217
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:05,320
This bad bird is dark and has a red feather on its head.

218
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,320
Let's go.

219
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,320
Let's go and have a look.

220
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,320
Let's go.

221
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,320
Uncle.

222
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,320
Uncle.

223
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,320
I want to ask you something.

224
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,320
Is there anything bad that hurts people here?

225
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,320
I saw that a few people stopped their coffins in the yard.

226
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,320
Did something happen?

227
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,320
What?

228
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,320
Uncle, don't push me.

229
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,320
I didn't mean anything bad.

230
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,320
Uncle.

231
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,320
Uncle.

232
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,320
Uncle.

233
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,320
Uncle.

234
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,320
Uncle.

235
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,320
Uncle.

236
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,320
Uncle.

237
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,320
Uncle.

238
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,320
Uncle.

239
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,320
Uncle.

240
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,320
Uncle.

241
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,320
Uncle.

242
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,320
Uncle.

243
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,320
Uncle.

244
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,320
Uncle.

245
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,320
Uncle.

246
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,320
Uncle.

247
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,320
Uncle.

248
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,320
Uncle.

249
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,320
Uncle.

250
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,320
Uncle.

251
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,320
Uncle.

252
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,320
Uncle.

253
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,320
Uncle.

254
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,320
Uncle.

255
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,320
Uncle.

256
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,320
Uncle.

257
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,320
Uncle.

258
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,320
Uncle.

259
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,320
Uncle.

260
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,320
Uncle.

261
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,320
Uncle.

262
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,320
Uncle.

263
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,320
Uncle.

264
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,320
Uncle.

265
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,320
Uncle.

266
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,320
Uncle.

267
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,320
Uncle.

268
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,320
Uncle.

269
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,320
Uncle.

270
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,320
Uncle.

271
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,320
Uncle.

272
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,320
Uncle.

273
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,320
Uncle.

274
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,320
Uncle.

275
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,320
Uncle.

276
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,320
Uncle.

277
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,320
Uncle.

278
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,320
Uncle.

279
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,320
Uncle.

280
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,320
Uncle.

281
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,320
Uncle.

282
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,320
Uncle.

283
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,320
Uncle.

284
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,320
Uncle.

285
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,320
Uncle.

286
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,320
Uncle.

287
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,320
Uncle.

288
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,320
Uncle.

289
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,320
Uncle.

290
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,320
Uncle.

291
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,320
Uncle.

292
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,320
Uncle.

293
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,320
Uncle.

294
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,320
Uncle.

295
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,720
Master.

296
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,840
What are you doing?

297
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,320
I…

298
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,040
Let me go.

299
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,040
Let me go.

300
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,720
I didn't expect that in this small place,

301
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,720
someone would use the lock-on syndrome.

302
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,720
Why do you want to control these people?

303
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,720
Since you can't explain it clearly,

304
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,720
let them explain it.

305
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,720
You're a mortal, I don't want to hurt you.

306
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,720
No matter what your grudges are,

307
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,720
let them go first.

308
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,720
You...

309
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,720
I'll go look at that old man.

310
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,720
What a great lock-on syndrome.

311
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,320
He's just an ordinary man.

312
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,320
How can he have such speed and strength?

313
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,320
You can't just let go and hit him.

314
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,320
Really?

315
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,320
It's endless.

316
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,320
Don't blame me for using the lock-on syndrome.

317
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,320
This isn't just an ordinary lock-on syndrome.

318
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,320
The person who drew it has high magical power.

319
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,320
It doesn't seem like you can draw it.

320
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,320
What are you doing?

321
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,320
You...

322
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,320
You...

323
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,320
Hey, you...

324
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,320
Stop digging.

325
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,320
He actually broke his bones.

326
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,320
He...

327
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,320
He wants to bury himself alive.

328
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,320
This seal...

329
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,320
It's to stop him.

330
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,320
It's to save him.

331
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,320
You've offended me.

332
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,320
Hey, hey, hey.

333
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,320
You actually played this in my eyes?

334
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,320
You really have some guts.

335
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,320
Black evil bird.

336
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,320
Let's go.

337
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,320
Bo Yu Sword.

338
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,320
Old man.

339
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:17,320
He's still alive.

340
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:21,320
I'm going to kill him.

341
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:24,320
This is too dangerous.

342
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:26,320
I'll go back to the old man.

343
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,320
Where's the old man?

344
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,320
I'll go back to the old man.

345
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,320
I'll go back to the old man.

346
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,320
I'll go back to the old man.

347
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,320
What's going on?

348
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,320
What's going on?

349
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,320
What's going on?

350
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,720
Little ball, you cured this old lady.

351
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,640
What did you do to her?

352
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,880
What is this?

353
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,880
This is the thing that causes a person to have a hoarse voice and a sharp tongue.

354
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,280
It's a person's phlegm.

355
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,680
There was a rumor that black birds hurt people.

356
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,480
You're actually saving people, right?

357
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,280
Who are you?

358
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,480
Miss, did you save me?

359
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:35,880
Madam, do you still remember what happened to you?

360
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:39,480
Did I also have a strange disease?

361
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,680
Yes.

362
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,880
There was a strange disease in the village.

363
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,680
A lot of people died.

364
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,480
What kind of strange disease?

365
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,080
There was a voice that kept saying in my ear,

366
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,880
I, Kuaiwa,

367
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:55,080
and then my hand kept running to the ground.

368
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,080
At first, I used a stick to dig the hole.

369
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:59,280
When the hole was broken, I used a stick.

370
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,280
When the stick was broken, I used my hand.

371
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,280
I knew that I was going to bury myself to death.

372
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,680
I knew that I was going to die.

373
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,680
You knew that you were going to bury yourself to death?

374
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,480
Then what's the matter with this talisman?

375
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,880
Twenty years ago, the world was in chaos.

376
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:19,080
The world was in chaos.

377
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:22,880
My husband saved a Taoist who was about to die.

378
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,280
This talisman was given by that Taoist.

379
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,280
It said that the world was in chaos.

380
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:30,280
This talisman might be able to keep people alive at critical moments.

381
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:33,280
Twenty years ago, during the battle of the gods and the earth...

382
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:36,880
Until a few days ago, someone in the village got sick.

383
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,480
My husband tried to use this talisman on the patient.

384
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:42,480
It really can keep people quiet.

385
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,480
He then used the talisman's design to make a lot of new talismans

386
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,280
for the villagers.

387
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,880
Your husband didn't practice.

388
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:53,480
According to the rules, the talisman he drew should be very effective.

389
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,680
You used your own blood?

390
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:59,880
He was the only one who wasn't infected.

391
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,480
I let him go, but he wasn't happy.

392
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,080
He said that he could save one person after another.

393
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,080
It should be this thing that looks like a seed.

394
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:11,480
It entered your ears and bewitched you to commit suicide.

395
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:14,680
Your husband didn't hear it and was not affected.

396
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,680
That's right.

397
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:19,080
If we can pull out all the monsters in our ears,

398
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:22,080
will the villagers be able to be saved?

399
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,680
Little ball, look at them.

400
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:38,080
Can you pull out the seed?

401
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,280
This talisman can only hold them back for a while.

402
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:48,680
We need to figure out where the monster seed came from and how to solve it.

403
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,680
Since you know how to save people,

404
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:53,480
do you know any other clues?

405
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,080
Let's go.

406
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:02,680
The villagers in the house don't have much time left.

407
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:03,880
I'll go find a way to save them.

408
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:04,880
You guys take care of yourselves.

409
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,680
I'll ask someone to help later.

410
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:09,080
Little ball, let's go.

411
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,280
Okay.

412
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,480
I'm sorry.

413
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,080
I'm sorry.

414
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,080
I'm sorry.

415
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,080
I'm sorry.

416
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:49,080
I'm sorry.

417
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,080
I'm sorry.

418
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,080
I'm sorry.

419
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,080
I'm sorry.

420
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,080
I'm sorry.

421
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,080
I'm sorry.

422
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,080
I'm sorry.

423
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,080
I'm sorry.

424
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:05,080
I'm sorry.

425
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,080
I'm sorry.

426
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,080
I'm sorry.

427
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:11,080
I'm sorry.

428
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,080
I'm sorry.

429
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,080
I'm sorry.

430
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:17,080
I'm sorry.

431
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:19,080
I'm sorry.

432
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,080
I'm sorry.

433
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,080
I'm sorry.

434
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:25,080
I'm sorry.

435
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,080
I'm sorry.

436
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,080
I'm sorry.

437
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,080
I'm sorry.

438
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:33,080
I'm sorry.

439
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:35,080
I'm sorry.

440
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:37,080
I'm sorry.

441
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,080
I'm sorry.

442
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,080
I'm sorry.

443
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:43,080
I'm sorry.

444
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:45,080
I'm sorry.

445
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:47,080
I'm sorry.

446
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:49,080
I'm sorry.

447
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,080
I'm sorry.

448
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:53,080
I'm sorry.

449
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,080
I'm sorry.

450
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:57,080
I'm sorry.

451
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,080
I'm sorry.

452
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,080
I'm sorry.

453
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,080
I'm sorry.
