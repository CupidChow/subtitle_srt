00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

33
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

36
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

37
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

38
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

39
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

40
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

41
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

42
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

43
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

44
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

45
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

46
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

47
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

48
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Run.

49
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Let's stop!

50
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
You won't be able to get away.

51
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
You won't be able to get away.

52
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
You think your crime can still be forgiven?

53
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Don't think of getting rid of me.

54
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Quan Quan.

55
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
No. Don't go.

56
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
You are mine. Mine!

57
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
You are mine.

58
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Luoyi Town.

59
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
This is the place you wanted to bring me.

60
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I remember that Luoyi Town has always been lively.

61
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Is it too late now?

62
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Why is it so quiet?

63
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:56,300
One willow has been هذاographed...

64
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,500
I finally saw one bright spot.

65
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,500
Let's go and check.

66
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,440
You're so timid.

67
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,440
Keep your voice down.

68
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,800
Keep your voice down.

69
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,600
You scared away Ying Chong.

70
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,360
Little brother,

71
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,320
it's not good to play on the road

72
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,080
when you don't go home to sleep at night.

73
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,080
Hold on.

74
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,840
Why are you holding them?

75
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,680
Sister, are you going to stay in the hotel?

76
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,480
No, I'm...

77
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,480
Senior Shen, let me do it.

78
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,440
This is my uncle's inn.

79
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,440
I'm sorry.

80
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,440
I'm sorry.

81
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,440
I'm sorry.

82
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,440
I'm sorry.

83
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,440
I'm sorry.

84
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,440
I'm sorry.

85
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,440
I'm sorry.

86
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,440
I'm sorry.

87
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,440
I'm sorry.

88
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,440
I'm sorry.

89
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,440
I'm sorry.

90
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,440
I'm sorry.

91
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,440
I'm sorry.

92
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,440
I'm sorry.

93
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,200
Their whole family went out to visit their relatives.

94
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,280
They asked me to keep an eye on the inn.

95
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,520
What's your name?

96
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,320
Luo Xiao Tan.

97
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,840
Are there any other guests in the inn?

98
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,560
The inn has been in bad business recently.

99
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,560
There are no guests.

100
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,320
That's why my uncle's family

101
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,840
went out to visit relatives.

102
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,720
Sister,

103
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,800
your room is in the east of the second floor.

104
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,760
It's so late. Are you still going out?

105
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:40,760
I'm going to catch the insects

106
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,960
and find Brother Yu Yan to change the hall.

107
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,360
You can register yourself.

108
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,520
Xiao Mei Qiu,

109
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,240
do you feel strange?

110
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,240
Since I entered Luo Yi Town,

111
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,960
I have a very uncomfortable feeling.

112
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,440
But I can't tell why.

113
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,280
It's like talking to that kid just now.

114
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,160
I always feel something wrong.

115
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,800
If someone wants to do a welcome ceremony for us,

116
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,000
whether it's that kid or something else that happens to him...

117
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,240
it must be this strange seed.

118
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,440
Xiao Mei Qiu,

119
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,320
the demon grass is from thisdam.

120
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,160
So you brought me here.

121
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,560
Sun這樣的風

122
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,480
字這麼氣

123
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:00,920
不得可欲

124
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:01,640
Б conservatives

125
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,360
aren't sane.

126
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,600
ligt to say

127
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,840
that they speak the language

128
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:08,480
One eagle, one tower.

129
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:12,680
One eagle, one tower.

130
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:14,680
Let's go.

131
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:38,060
The

132
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,440
Boss, are you tired?

133
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,320
Take a walk.

134
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:53,640
Okay.

135
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,360
Dinner is ready.

136
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,160
Okay.

137
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,440
Dinner is ready.

138
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,840
What happened?

139
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,800
They left everything behind

140
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,400
and disappeared.

141
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,720
Why didn't Chang'er find anything

142
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,120
when he came here?

143
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,640
Li Xian can't call him either.

144
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,080
What did the immortals of my father

145
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,280
do to make a living?

146
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,400
I didn't notice anything

147
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,440
about such a big thing.

148
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,080
How is it?

149
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,480
Nothing?

150
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
It seems that this matter is not half of it.

151
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,360
It's a good thing that you brought me here

152
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,640
to tie you up.

153
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:30,600
One eagle, one tower.

154
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,400
One, two, three, four, five.

155
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,360
It's strange.

156
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,560
Why are there only these kids left?

157
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,080
I've caught a lot of them.

158
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,400
I think I've caught all of them.

159
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,640
Let's go find Yu'an

160
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,680
to change the candy.

161
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:43,520
Okay.

162
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,160
I was wondering

163
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,440
why these kids looked weird.

164
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,360
It turns out that they were controlled by someone.

165
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,640
Follow them.

166
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,160
Let's go meet

167
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,560
Yu'an.

168
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,600
The closer we get to this place,

169
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,120
the more demons there are.

170
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,360
It seems that we've found the right place.

171
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,880
There are too many things here.

172
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,000
I can't burn them.

173
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,520
If we spread out a lot,

174
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,920
the consequences will be unimaginable.

175
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,400
Although the barrier can temporarily

176
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,360
stop the demons from flying

177
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,400
outside the Lo Yi Formation,

178
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,800
we still have to find another way

179
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,000
to control the parts that have spread out.

180
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,480
I told you last time

181
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,760
that I wouldn't ask for his help.

182
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,080
Forget it.

183
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,720
My back face

184
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,840
is not the same anyway.

185
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:43,960
Okay, Little Plum.

186
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:44,880
Let's go in.

187
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,040
Follow me.

188
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,520
Don't run around.

189
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,520
It's my turn.

190
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,600
It's my turn.

191
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,880
They all have it.

192
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:07,960
Each one of you.

193
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,400
Here.

194
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,640
This is the candy for you.

195
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,760
Thank you, Brother Yu'an.

196
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,680
It's my turn.

197
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,200
Here.

198
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,960
Xiao Tan, you've caught a lot.

199
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,760
Of course.

200
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,400
Here, I'll give you candy.

201
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,680
Okay, next one.

202
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,480
Little Bear, what are you doing?

203
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,040
Jiaqian.

204
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,000
What are you doing there?

205
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,160
Look.

206
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,120
Could it be you're visiting

207
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,200
that Pugong camp under…

208
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,280
It is only a getting familiar

209
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,440
yet disgusting feeling

210
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,920
as soon as I enter Luo Yizhen.

211
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,480
Such ghost grass...

212
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,720
So many various people

213
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,080
disappeared overnight

214
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,200
to make you into a armada

215
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,960
and use them to conspiracy a demon.

216
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:56,940
This lady

217
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,280
looks familiar...

218
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,920
Aren't you from the Sun family?

219
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,520
Are you here to exchange the sugar?

220
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,520
You're still pretending to be dead.

221
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,640
Help!

222
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,560
Demon!

223
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,080
Get out of this body!

224
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,080
I...

225
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:20,200
I don't understand what you're saying!

226
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,000
We're not meant to be together.

227
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,120
Why must you do this to me?

228
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,120
You're so blind!

229
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,120
Tell me!

230
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,640
Where did you get the ghost grass?

231
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,920
How did you know it was useful?

232
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,440
I really don't understand what you're saying!

233
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,400
Let's see how long you can keep your mouth shut!

234
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,360
How dare you, demon!

235
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,240
If you keep being stubborn,

236
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,840
you'll be destroyed!

237
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,640
I...

238
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,040
I'm here...

239
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,560
to die!

240
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,840
He was just controlled by the ghost grass.

241
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,640
The demon isn't with him.

242
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,240
Where is he?

243
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,240
Who is he?

244
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,840
Who is he?

245
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,440
Who is he?

246
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,840
Guess!

247
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,840
Guess!

248
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,840
Guess!

249
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,840
Guess!

250
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,240
Guess!

251
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,440
Guess!

252
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,040
Guess!

253
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,040
Guess!

254
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,040
You're so noisy!

255
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,240
Cai Qing!

256
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,240
Cai Qing!

257
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,840
This...

258
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,040
This is...

259
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,840
Cai Qing!

260
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,040
Cai Qing!

261
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:33,840
Cai Qing!

262
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,040
Give me back Cai Qing!

263
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,640
Cai Qing.

264
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,640
Cai Qing.

265
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,040
Who...

266
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,240
Who is talking?

267
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,240
Who is Cai Qing?

268
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,840
Why are you still so cold?

269
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,040
Bring a jar of pickled cabbage

270
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,640
and bring it to that fellow.

271
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,840
W-Were you talking to me?

272
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,440
Cai Qing came to deliver the handmaiden today!

273
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,040
The handmaiden?

274
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,040
What?

275
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,440
He's wearing new shoes!

276
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,840
Are you here to return to your lover?

277
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,640
This is...

278
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,440
The doll!

279
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,840
Why did this dog sneak in again?

280
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,440
You must watch over him.

281
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,440
Don't frighten Madam.

282
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,440
You are...

283
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,640
Watch out!

284
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,640
How dare you hit Young Master?

285
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,640
How can you shoot arrows here?

286
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:32,640
Zhao Jian, this girl is talking about me.

287
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,640
Hey, bitch.

288
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,640
Our Young Master is shooting arrows in his own yard.

289
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,640
How can you be bothered?

290
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,640
Even if it's shot at you,

291
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,640
you still can't see it.

292
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,640
You're so rude.

293
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,640
I'll kill you.

294
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,640
After you've finished, our Young Master wants to sneak away.

295
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:49,640
Hurry up and kneel down and kowtow to our Young Master.

296
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:52,640
The day before yesterday, I begged my father to take me hunting.

297
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,640
He was busy with work.

298
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:56,640
Luckily, I asked Young Master to take this dog to practice.

299
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,640
It's dangerous.

300
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,640
Young Master, he's dead.

301
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,640
I...

302
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,640
I just wanted to shoot that dog.

303
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,640
Who would have thought that he would come to me?

304
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,640
What should I do?

305
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,640
Young Master.

306
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,640
Zhao Jian, help me.

307
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,640
Young Master.

308
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:22,640
Young Master.

309
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,640
It's not painful.

310
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,640
Is Wei'er crying?

311
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,640
What's wrong with Wei'er?

312
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:30,640
It's Cai Qing.

313
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,640
Dr. Jiang.

314
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,640
Maybe we can still save him.

315
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,640
Why are you still standing there?

316
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,640
Hurry up and save him.

317
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,640
Be quiet.

318
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,640
Lock all the doors.

319
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:41,640
No one is allowed to enter.

320
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,640
Father, save me.

321
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,640
Father, I didn't mean to do that.

322
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,640
You bastard.

323
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,640
Look at what you did to Young Master.

324
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,640
Master, I was wrong.

325
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,640
It's all my fault.

326
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,640
Please forgive me.

327
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:01,640
You said his name is Cai Qing?

328
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,640
Yes.

329
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,640
He is the daughter of Sun Xiu Niang.

330
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:07,640
He is also the husband of Yu'an.

331
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,640
Yu'an?

332
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,640
You, come here.

333
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,640
Master.

334
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,640
Master.

335
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:22,640
But Master, he hasn't been suffocated yet.

336
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:26,640
Can this wound still be saved?

337
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,640
You, what are you talking about?

338
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,640
Hurry up and save him.

339
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,640
Today, Young Master is not at home at all.

340
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,640
Do you understand?

341
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,640
Hurry up and save him.

342
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,640
Hurry up.

343
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,640
It hurts.

344
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,640
Is there anyone to save me?

345
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,640
Mother.

346
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,640
Yu'an.

347
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,640
Steward Zhao.

348
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,640
You carried so many things.

349
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:00,640
Where are you going?

350
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:04,640
Yu'an.

351
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,640
It's the fish sauce.

352
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,640
Madam ordered a batch of seedlings.

353
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,640
I'll send them to the flower shop.

354
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,640
How can I trouble Steward Zhao to send them personally?

355
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,640
No need.

356
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,640
I'll get them.

357
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,640
Let me find them.

358
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,640
Hurry up. Master is looking for you.

359
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,640
Hurry up and go with me.

360
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,640
I'm here.

361
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,640
Master is looking for me?

362
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,640
Yu'an, please help me.

363
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:24,640
Since Master is looking for you, then go quickly.

364
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,640
Okay. Then I'll trouble Steward Zhao.

365
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,640
It's easy to say.

366
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,640
Yu'an.

367
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,640
Yu'an, don't go.

368
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,640
Don't leave me.

369
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,640
Yu'an.

370
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,640
Don't blame me.

371
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,640
I don't want to either.

372
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,640
This is Master's idea.

373
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,640
Please close your eyes.

374
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,640
It's Young Master who killed you.

375
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,640
It's Master who betrayed you.

376
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,640
I...

377
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,640
I have no choice.

378
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,640
Don't hate me.

379
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,640
If you have any hatred, then hate them.

380
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,640
Do you hate me?

381
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,640
Who?

382
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,640
Who is talking?

383
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,640
I help you to take revenge.

384
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,640
How is it?

385
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,640
Who are you?

386
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,640
Don't worry.

387
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,640
No one can escape from the person who harmed you.

388
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,640
No.

389
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,640
No.

390
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,640
Juanjuan.

391
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,640
Juanjuan.

392
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,640
Wake up.

393
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,640
Wake up.

394
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,640
Wake up.

395
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,640
Young Master,

396
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,640
fly again.

397
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,640
Go.

398
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,640
Go.
