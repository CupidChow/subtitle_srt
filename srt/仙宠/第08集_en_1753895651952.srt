1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I can't live without you

2
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I can't live without you

3
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I can't live without you

4
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I can't live without you

5
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I can't live without you

6
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I can't live without you

7
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I can't live without you

8
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I can't live without you

9
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I can't live without you

10
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I can't live without you

11
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I can't live without you

12
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
The King's Avatar

13
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Episode 12

14
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
My name is Ning An.

15
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
The meaning is to rest in peace.

16
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,800
But I never got that peace in my life.

17
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,440
When I was a kid,

18
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,320
I also looked up to my father's back.

19
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,640
I hoped to become a hero like him in the future.

20
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,960
But when my father couldn't come back,

21
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,480
I knew that

22
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,200
I couldn't bear the pain of losing my son.

23
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,360
I promised my mother

24
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,000
to give up the position of heir to the family

25
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,280
and focus on studying.

26
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,120
I hope one day,

27
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,840
I could change the fate of my family.

28
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,360
This is my choice.

29
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,360
I don't regret it.

30
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,240
Since then,

31
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,200
I've been studying hard every day.

32
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,760
My world is only this little world.

33
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:41,920
Gradually, I got used to

34
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,720
my mother's overprotection and expectations.

35
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,120
I got used to being like a plant.

36
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,520
I thought it was all natural.

37
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,200
Until...

38
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,960
At last year's Strange Festival,

39
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,280
who could compose an ahora-ìœ„e,

40
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:05,040
whose calligraphy Keynote turned off its light.

41
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,360
Hey girly, you're too heavy.

42
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,660
Eat it instead.

43
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:50,420
Tsukorda, this

44
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:51,680
are the best.

45
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,320
This fire is so annoying

46
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,240
It's hard for An'er to read

47
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,320
Hush

48
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,920
An'er, what's that sound?

49
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,360
Nothing

50
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,680
I want to get up and close the window

51
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,920
I hit the chair

52
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,760
Be careful

53
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,920
I know

54
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,520
Can I come out now?

55
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,120
You

56
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,680
Who are you?

57
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,240
You drew me

58
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,760
But you don't know who I am?

59
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,960
Why don't you

60
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,480
Give me a name?

61
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:22,840
Aya

62
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:24,960
Xiao Hong

63
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,800
You came out of the painting

64
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,000
Then

65
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,840
Xiaohui

66
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,680
This is okay

67
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,960
I agree

68
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,920
Okay, Xiaohui

69
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,040
What's the matter with you?

70
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,920
The fish lantern you drew is so ugly

71
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,000
I want a lantern

72
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,720
You draw me a new one

73
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,200
But I haven't seen a lantern

74
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,000
I don't know what the lantern looks like

75
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,000
Today is a coincidence

76
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,240
You haven't seen the lantern

77
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,440
Why don't you go and have a look?

78
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,480
It's so late

79
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,880
Mother will be worried

80
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,040
It's okay

81
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,280
I'll protect you

82
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,480
Xiaohui

83
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,760
Don't worry

84
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,360
Even if you let go

85
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,160
I will find you

86
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,880
What are you waiting for?

87
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,040
I saw something fun

88
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,040
Come on

89
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,040
What's this?

90
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,600
It's a lantern

91
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,600
It's a lantern

92
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,600
It's a lantern

93
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,600
It's a lantern

94
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,600
By the way

95
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,280
What does the lantern look like?

96
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,280
It's a mole

97
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,600
I thought

98
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,280
I had forgotten what the heat of the heart was

99
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,080
But that night

100
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,160
Xiaohui's smile

101
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,160
It's like the most brilliant lantern

102
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,760
Lighted up the corner of my heart

103
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,200
Just like the damitia

104
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:44,400
mÃºsica

105
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:48,760
I thought that I can accompany him like this forever,

106
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,160
but,

107
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:55,200
I'm afraid I've been too tired to study lately.

108
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,840
I'll be fine soon.

109
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,680
An'er,

110
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,800
take a rest.

111
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,800
You've lost a lot of weight these days.

112
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,200
You can't have any problems

113
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,640
with your exam next year.

114
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,040
Yes, Mother.

115
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,440
I'm sorry,

116
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,440
I'm sorry.

117
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,440
I'm sorry.

118
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,440
I'm sorry.

119
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,440
I'm sorry.

120
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,440
I'm sorry.

121
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,440
I'm sorry.

122
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,440
I'm sorry.

123
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,440
I'm sorry.

124
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,440
I'm sorry.

125
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,440
I'm sorry.

126
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,440
I'm sorry.

127
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,440
I'm sorry.

128
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,440
I'm sorry.

129
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,440
I'm sorry.

130
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,440
Xiao Hui.

131
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,440
You're back at last.

132
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,440
It doesn't matter.

133
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,440
I'm here for a walk.

134
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,440
I'm afraid that no one is here.

135
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,440
So I feel a little tired.

136
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,440
It's a small injury.

137
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,440
It will be fine soon.

138
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,440
Does it taste good?

139
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,440
What is this?

140
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,440
This is the latest candy

141
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,440
I brought you from the market.

142
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,720
It tastes weird.

143
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,920
I brought it for you.

144
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,080
How dare you say it's not delicious?

145
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,240
I can tell that

146
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,880
Xiao Hui is talking nonsense.

147
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,040
But I have no right to question her.

148
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,000
Ming An.

149
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,660
Ming An.

150
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,880
Wake up!

151
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,160
Ming An.

152
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,240
Xiao Hui.

153
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,840
You're awake.

154
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,120
Did you drop my holy grass?

155
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,000
Holy grass?

156
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:43,200
I...

157
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,040
It's nothing.

158
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,920
What are you doing here?

159
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,640
We're here to findiers.

160
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,640
How did you get hurt like this?

161
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,040
Does it hurt?

162
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,040
It's okay.

163
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,440
Don't look for the medicine anymore.

164
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,640
It's too dangerous.

165
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,640
If something happens to me,

166
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,440
what's the point of me living?

167
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,440
Don't worry.

168
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,440
I'm good at it.

169
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,240
I'll find a way to save you.

170
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,240
I'm weak every day.

171
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,240
The time to wake up is getting shorter.

172
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,440
Xiao Hui tried her best to find the medicine.

173
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,040
The journey is more and more dangerous.

174
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,440
But I can't stop her.

175
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:30,840
I can only watch her become like this.

176
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,040
You didn't bump into Xiao Hui by accident, right?

177
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:45,040
How did you know she existed?

178
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,640
When I treated you in the daytime,

179
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,240
I noticed the painting on the wall.

180
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,440
The little boat in the painting was lit up.

181
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,640
But I didn't see anyone.

182
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,640
I always felt something was missing.

183
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,840
Plus,

184
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:57,440
I smelled the scent of jade sea spirit juice on you.

185
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,040
Jade sea spirit juice?

186
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,240
I heard that

187
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,440
it was a fairy herb that was guarded by ancient beasts.

188
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,640
Ordinary people can't get it.

189
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,240
I asked Madam Ning.

190
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,440
She never asked for this medicine for you.

191
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,840
I learned that

192
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,240
someone was treating you in secret.

193
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,240
I didn't expect it to be such a little ghost.

194
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,640
You must have suffered a lot.

195
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,040
Childe Ning,

196
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,040
that ink is indeed a spirit ink.

197
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,840
You painted with this ink.

198
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,640
But the painting was painted by chance.

199
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,840
It was mixed with your blood and turned into a clear painting.

200
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,240
That's why you have Xiao Hui now.

201
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,440
You mean...

202
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,840
It was you who caused me to be like this.

203
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,240
You demon!

204
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:46,840
Madam.

205
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,840
Leave my son alone!

206
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,840
Madam, it wasn't her.

207
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,040
She caused me to be like this.

208
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:50,440
Madam.

209
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,240
You can't do this to me.

210
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,240
You are bewitched by this demon.

211
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,440
If it wasn't her,

212
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,640
you wouldn't be so weak.

213
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,840
Madam,

214
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,040
I haven't finished yet.

215
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,240
Don't worry.

216
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,240
Although this little painting

217
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,440
was painted with Childe Ning's blood,

218
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,440
it's not just to provide the blood

219
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,440
to make Childe Ning sick.

220
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,640
It's just to make people tired.

221
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,640
Then why would my son...

222
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,640
Ling Lang was poisoned.

223
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,840
Poisoned?

224
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,040
How could it be poisoned?

225
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,440
Who is trying to harm my son?

226
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,040
Poisoners are very cautious.

227
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,840
They only use one item that Ling Lang often uses.

228
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:26,440
It's to ensure that he only uses a small amount of poison every time.

229
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,840
When the poison slowly accumulates to the five organs and six organs,

230
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,640
Ling Lang will die immediately.

231
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,440
And he can do anything without knowing it.

232
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,040
Useful item?

233
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,240
What item?

234
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,840
I'm the one who's been keeping an eye on him.

235
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,840
And our mother and I have been

236
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,640
very close to each other.

237
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,440
Don't mention taking revenge on him.

238
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,640
The poison is in this inkstone.

239
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,040
Impossible.

240
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,840
This is from Sect Leader Hua.

241
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,440
Sect Leader Hua...

242
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,640
Hua Feng Yu...

243
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,040
Why did he...

244
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,840
Could it be...

245
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,040
As far as I know,

246
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,240
at the beginning of the battle,

247
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,040
the position of South King Jing was still unknown.

248
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,240
Sect Leader Ning and Sect Leader Hua were both candidates.

249
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:10,640
But Sect Leader Ning died in the battlefield.

250
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,840
After the battle,

251
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:15,840
Sect Leader Hua relied on Zhuo Yue's battle skills to help South King Jing.

252
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,640
I thought that because he was my father's brother,

253
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,240
he would sincerely take care of us.

254
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:26,040
I even heard him say that he would rather be a sect member.

255
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,840
I helped him become South King Jing and clear the obstacles.

256
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,240
He actually...

257
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,240
He actually wanted to kill me.

258
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:36,040
Then, was Father's death also...

259
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:38,840
Mother, you're saying that Father's death

260
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,640
is also possible because of him?

261
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,240
What's wrong with you?

262
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,840
Let me see.

263
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,640
How is my son?

264
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,240
It's too late.

265
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,040
My medicine needs three days to completely detoxify.

266
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,240
But in Childe Ning's current state,

267
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,640
I'm afraid that he can't even hold out a single incense.

268
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,240
My son.

269
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,640
My son, it's Mother who has caused you to die.

270
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:18,840
It's Mother who has caused you to die.

271
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,440
My son.

272
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,640
My son.

273
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,040
You...

274
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,040
My son.

275
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,840
My son.

276
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,440
My son.

277
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,440
My son.

278
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,440
My son.

279
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,840
How many times have I been pushing the Bo Yun Sword to the battlefield?

280
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:17,440
A little demon like you is just a fatal blow.

281
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,040
Xiaohui.

282
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,440
Xiaohui.

283
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,640
Xiaohui.

284
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,840
Ning'an's blood is boiling.

285
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:50,840
Xiaohui only knows that this blood belongs to Ning'an.

286
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:53,240
That's why she can hold out for these three days.

287
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,040
Idiot.

288
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:59,240
Idiot, idiot! You idiot!

289
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:03,640
You think that by dying for him, he'll be happy?

290
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:06,640
He will never forget you in this lifetime!

291
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:11,640
How can you let him live in the prison every day?

292
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,640
Qianjun, you...

293
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:40,640
I've left half of his primordial spirit for you.

294
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,040
Even so,

295
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:47,840
it's not normal for you to give him a complete primordial spirit.

296
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:50,040
Are you going to find him?

297
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,240
You decide for yourself.

298
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:56,040
Xiaohui, one day,

299
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:00,040
we will meet again.

300
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,840
GG.

301
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,480
My body is really weak.

302
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,360
I'll be out of breath in a while.

303
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,520
It's better to be young and strong.

304
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,000
My Lord.

305
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:51,920
My Lord.

306
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,440
Ning An was saved by Li Xiao.

307
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,960
Tianquan is also there.

308
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,920
He's lucky.

309
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,160
Then this time,

310
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,840
we can use the plan of Ning family

311
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:02,960
to make soup.

312
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:06,360
We have a lot of clues about Hua Feng Yu.

313
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,080
There's no difference.

314
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,120
But Li Xiao

315
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:12,880
is in trouble for doing bad things three times.

316
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:15,160
Since it's his fault this time,

317
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,680
let him make up for it next time.

318
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,480
I understand.

319
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,840
It's too chaotic.

320
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,760
It's hurtful to keep the primordial spirit.

321
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,880
Your primordial spirit was damaged.

322
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,920
And only that half-weak primordial spirit

323
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,600
wants to exchange with Xiao Hui.

324
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:48,800
It's not easy.

325
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,800
You don't understand.

326
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,960
Xiao Hui thought that if he died,

327
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,800
Ning An would be safe.

328
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,840
But if he died,

329
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,800
Ning An's heart would be dead.

330
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,640
If he died first,

331
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,200
Ning An's heart would be broken.

332
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,760
Ning An's heart would be dead.

333
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,640
How can the one who died first

334
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,400
be alive?

335
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,800
Only if we give him hope,

336
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,240
even half-weak primordial spirit,

337
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,440
he can have the courage to live on.

338
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,560
General.

339
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,320
Actually, I...

340
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,240
When we left, Ning An told me

341
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,360
he wanted to re-establish his father's importance

342
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,640
and go to the mountain to learn art.

343
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,200
He wanted to reopen Ning's family one day

344
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,000
and find out the truth about his father's death.

345
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,880
He believed that he could exchange with Xiao Hui.

346
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,440
No matter how many years it takes.

347
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,080
Madam Ning agreed?

348
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,080
As long as she makes up her mind,

349
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,400
there's always a way to convince her mother.

350
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,080
Speaking of the death of the head of Ning family,

351
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,880
when I entered Ning's family,

352
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,320
I saw a similar flying flag

353
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,800
being shot by a demon.

354
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,720
I think the whole thing

355
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,200
is not that simple.

356
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,280
When I entered Ning's family,

357
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,760
I also felt the murderous aura.

358
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,880
But the demon is hard to find.

359
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,800
For the time being, we can't find any solid evidence

360
00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,840
that is related to the demon.

361
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,160
The ghost grass has been removed.

362
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,720
I hope we don't get into any bigger trouble.

363
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,000
Juan Juan.

364
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,400
You're right.

365
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,720
She shouldn't have been selfish.

366
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,320
She just didn't know how to face it.

367
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,400
She left you in pain alone.

368
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:33,800
Senior.

369
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,640
She hasn't fulfilled her promise to you.

370
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,720
She should trust you more.

371
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,160
Senior.

372
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,200
I'll take good care of your shoulder.

373
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,160
No matter what you become,

374
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,360
she should come to you.

375
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:52,640
Right?

376
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:03,880
Senior.

377
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,400
Do you know?

378
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,800
Today, an innocent life was almost buried

379
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,320
under the sword.

380
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,280
Luckily, I left half of her soul.

381
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,240
Don't talk about me.

382
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,480
I was also shocked.

383
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,320
Who knew she would suddenly rush over

384
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,360
and hold the sword?

385
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,040
Alright.

386
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,360
I'll protect you

387
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,760
from the sword you left me.

388
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,240
Today,

389
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,840
it's all thanks to Li Xiao.

390
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,440
He took her down from the sword in time.

391
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,160
Otherwise, even if I had to risk my life,

392
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,520
I wouldn't have been able to keep her soul.

393
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,840
Luckily, she wasn't hurt.

394
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,720
Senior Wei Li.

395
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,200
Cherubar constellation Mist jump

396
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,320
Po Yunchian

397
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,960
has recognized Li Xiao.

398
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,640
At night,

399
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,880
the young lady will be alone here.

400
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,720
I wish to spend the rest of my life with you

401
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:23,320
I will only sigh for a moment as time goes by

402
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:26,320
I cry as I look at you

403
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,320
I am still thinking of you

404
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:34,320
This is the first time I look back on the past
