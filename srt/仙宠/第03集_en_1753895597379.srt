1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,040
Usually in tea,

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:23,260
when

3
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:24,100
Cai Qing.

4
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:24,980
Cai Qing.

5
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:26,700
How could this happen?

6
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:28,260
Cai Qing.

7
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:42,700
Cai... Cai Qing.

8
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:44,700
Cai Qing, is that you?

9
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,500
You brought me here.

10
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,140
Do you want me to help you?

11
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:49,340
I'm here.

12
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:50,340
I'm here.

13
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:51,340
I'm here.

14
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:52,340
I'm here.

15
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:54,380
Do you want me to avenge you?

16
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:55,380
Tell me.

17
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:57,380
Who caused you to be like this?

18
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:58,380
This...

19
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:22,540
You actually escaped here.

20
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:24,020
Good.

21
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:26,980
Yu An killed Cai Qing and buried him in the flower room.

22
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:28,740
Search the government.

23
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:29,740
Yes.

24
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:36,100
So you killed Cai Qing.

25
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:38,940
What are you waiting for?

26
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:39,940
Go.

27
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:52,940
This is fun.

28
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:54,900
Who? Who is it?

29
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,100
I'm Cai Qing.

30
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:57,140
Impossible.

31
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:58,140
Who are you?

32
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,140
Don't pretend to be a ghost here.

33
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:04,140
Wake up.

34
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:08,540
Wait.

35
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:10,340
Stop.

36
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:12,340
Wait.

37
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:15,340
Cai Qing, I was wrong.

38
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:17,340
Yes, I was wrong.

39
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,340
Please let me go.

40
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,260
Use this...

41
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:27,740
Drink.

42
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,740
Do you want to die?

43
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:42,460
Let me go.

44
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:43,740
My preferred one.

45
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,700
My chosen one.

46
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:56,940
I'm sorry.

47
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:03,900
You're right, Cai Qing.

48
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:07,140
These people deserve it.

49
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,180
Don't even think about

50
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,900
hurting your people.

51
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:13,500
Cai Qing!

52
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:14,900
Cai Qing!

53
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:16,620
Cai Qing!

54
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:17,940
Give me back Cai Qing!

55
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,820
She's a coward,

56
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:29,620
but she's still willful.

57
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:33,420
But I'm not giving up.

58
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:35,300
Even if the whole world ends,

59
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:38,660
I won't stop.

60
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,340
The pass is full of obstacles,

61
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:43,780
but I still can't give up.

62
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:46,420
The old book that I've been reading,

63
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:49,140
even if the whole world ends,

64
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:54,100
I won't ask where I'm going.

65
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:58,100
Love Crossed

66
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:02,060
Episodeека

67
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:24,260
Cai Qing,

68
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:25,260
Cai Qing!

69
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:30,100
The last drop of tears of the person who was attacked by the ghost grass

70
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:33,100
recorded the most harsh memory of this person's life.

71
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:36,100
We, the gods and demons, use the gods and demons as a stone.

72
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:40,100
Every stone is a strong one.

73
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:44,100
The gods and demons can also bring people into the memory of the dead.

74
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:48,100
They can sense the dead and feel the pain of the dead.

75
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:50,100
They can know that their world is in chaos and chaos.

76
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:53,100
They can even be in a state of collapse.

77
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,100
Such a little trick

78
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:58,100
couldn't have touched the famous God of War, Tianquan.

79
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:01,100
It's just that, after a long time,

80
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:04,100
God of War has a good time.

81
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,100
Speaking of which,

82
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:12,100
I can meet Tianquan here.

83
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,100
I can meet Tianquan here.

84
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,100
I can meet Tianquan here.

85
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,100
I can meet Tianquan here.

86
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:20,100
I can meet Tianquan here.

87
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,100
Speaking of which,

88
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:24,100
I can meet Tianquan here.

89
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:27,100
It's an unexpected death.

90
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:29,100
God of War has been in the same place for a long time.

91
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:32,100
He even has the same fate as our God of War.

92
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:36,100
This sentence has been out for ten years.

93
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:40,100
If God of War knows that I can be the first God of War,

94
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,100
will he be excited?

95
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,100
Be quiet.

96
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:54,100
You must have been in the dream of the God of War.

97
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,100
You're a little bit blind.

98
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:01,100
But that's it.

99
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:23,100
Episode 16

100
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:39,100
Juanjuan, wake up.

101
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,100
Juanjuan.

102
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,100
Who?

103
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:45,100
Who is calling me?

104
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:48,100
Juanjuan, wake up.

105
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,100
Juanjuan.

106
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:53,100
Juanjuan, wake up.

107
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,100
Impossible.

108
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:04,100
How could this be okay?

109
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:06,100
Even if he's the God of War,

110
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:09,100
he can't stand up after being hit by this blow.

111
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,100
Unless...

112
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,100
Who are you?

113
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:20,100
Juanjuan.

114
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,100
I'm sorry.

115
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:35,100
I made you wait.

116
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:38,100
Leave it to me.

117
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:41,100
It's so fast.

118
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:46,100
You're just a rotten mud in the water.

119
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,100
You're here to die.

120
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,100
God of War,

121
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:55,100
I won't let you get in my way.

122
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,100
It's you.

123
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,100
You destroyed the entire Lo Yi Town.

124
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,100
Don't blame me, God of War.

125
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,100
They're all your own people.

126
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:29,100
You used Cai Qing's grudge to cultivate the ghosts.

127
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:32,100
You buried yourself in the town overnight.

128
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,100
So what?

129
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:39,100
Such a cruel thing should be punished by heaven.

130
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,100
I'm sorry.

131
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,100
This grass is used as an earlobe.

132
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,100
But it's completely mature.

133
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:07,100
These people will turn into my soldiers.

134
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:09,100
Those who live and die,

135
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:12,100
their fear and hatred

136
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:15,100
will become my strength.

137
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,100
You're just a little demon.

138
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:21,100
You want to learn the God of War from the gods?

139
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,100
You're not capable.

140
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,100
You're so cruel.

141
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:38,100
You're not afraid that no one can pick up the earlobe after I die?

142
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,100
So are you going to pick it up

143
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:42,100
or not?

144
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,100
You're so scary.

145
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,100
You're really a God of War.

146
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,100
You can't beat me.

147
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:54,100
If I can't beat you, then run.

148
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:00,100
Little ball.

149
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:02,100
Little ball.

150
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,100
Are you okay, Little ball?

151
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:06,100
Little ball.

152
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,100
Little ball.

153
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,100
Are you okay, Little ball?

154
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,100
It's okay.

155
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:39,100
I've set up a family banquet for you.

156
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:42,100
From now on, you'll be my spiritual protection.

157
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:44,100
Little ball.

158
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:48,100
From today on, you're my god's pet.

159
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:03,100
Everyone is temporarily out of the control of the earlobe.

160
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,100
It seems that the god demon has escaped.

161
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,100
Little black.

162
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,100
How did it become like this?

163
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,100
Cai Qing has left.

164
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,100
I can't even save you.

165
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,100
I'm just a useless thing.

166
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:21,100
He's not the original black anymore.

167
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:24,100
He was shot by the god demon.

168
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:26,100
He's been secretly controlling these children.

169
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:29,100
He's controlling you to help him collect the earlobes.

170
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,100
Control?

171
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:32,100
No, I'm not being controlled.

172
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:35,100
From now on, it's the soul of Cai Qing that made me do this.

173
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,100
I did everything willingly.

174
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:40,100
There's no soul of Cai Qing in this world.

175
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:44,100
It's the sound of the god demon imitating Cai Qing that's seducing you.

176
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,100
Impossible. I don't believe it.

177
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:48,100
Cai Qing is obviously back.

178
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,100
He even said that he wanted them to enter hell.

179
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:54,100
Do you think that all of this is what Cai Qing wanted to see?

180
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:56,100
Of course.

181
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,100
They are all free and worthy.

182
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:01,100
Yuan, I see you as my biological brother.

183
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:04,100
You did well. I think highly of you.

184
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:08,100
If you bully Cai Qing, I won't agree to it.

185
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,100
Master, he killed Cai Qing again.

186
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:15,100
Yuan didn't just bully me, he even killed Cai Qing.

187
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:17,100
Please help us, Master.

188
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:21,100
Yuan, what they said is true.

189
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,100
Cai Qingliang, I didn't.

190
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:25,100
Cai Qing didn't come here.

191
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,100
You're lying.

192
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:29,100
Cai Qing came here to give you the fireworks this morning.

193
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,100
Cai Qing treats you so well.

194
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,100
I'm so tired.

195
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,100
You're so wronged.

196
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:35,100
Tell me the truth.

197
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,100
Where did you hide Cai Qing?

198
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:39,100
I didn't.

199
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,100
They always look so good.

200
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,100
But they're so dirty.

201
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:47,100
Lock him in the woodshed.

202
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,100
I'll explain to him the truth.

203
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,100
Don't let him come out.

204
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:53,100
Zhang Xun, Zhao Yi, Brother Hao, please let me out.

205
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,100
Nanyan will frame me.

206
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,100
Cai Qing must be in trouble.

207
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,100
I have to go out and find him.

208
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,100
Uncle Xu, Uncle Xu, I'm innocent.

209
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:03,100
Yuan has been working in Hua Jin Yun since he was a child.

210
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,100
You know me.

211
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:06,100
I've never been a man.

212
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:09,100
Uncle Xu, please let me out.

213
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:11,100
You're so loyal.

214
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:14,100
When the time comes, no one will pull you.

215
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,100
Yuan.

216
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,100
Poor Cai Qing.

217
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:34,100
Only if you turn into a demon can you fight against the evil.

218
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:48,100
Finally.

219
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,100
You're so slow.

220
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:01,100
I remember someone said

221
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,100
if you ask me for help,

222
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,100
I'll be...

223
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:06,100
What kind of person am I?

224
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:09,100
If I ask you for help, I'll be a dog.

225
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:11,100
You...

226
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:13,100
I'll be a dog.

227
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,100
I'll be a dog.

228
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,100
I'll be a dog.

229
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,100
I'll be a dog.

230
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:21,100
I'll be a dog.

231
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:23,100
I'll be a dog.

232
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,100
I'll be a dog.

233
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,100
You...

234
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,100
Calm down, High Immortal.

235
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:33,100
We'll be right there when the teacher receives the letter.

236
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,100
You are...

237
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,100
Replying to High Immortal,

238
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,100
my name is Pei Yun Jiang.

239
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:42,100
I was sent to the house of Immortal Jin Shun five years ago.

240
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:44,100
It's not easy for a young man

241
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,100
to have such a cruel teacher.

242
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:49,100
Jin Shun may have been a little powerful in the past,

243
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:53,100
but now he's just a lowly, unrighteous, and idle immortal.

244
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,100
Why are you still in his way?

245
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:59,100
It seems that I'm not helping Si Yun here.

246
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,100
I'll take my leave.

247
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:03,100
High Immortal!

248
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:05,100
High Immortal, you must be joking.

249
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,100
You just didn't want to fight for power,

250
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,100
so you went to the temple by yourself.

251
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:12,100
You came to this world to fight for the land

252
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:15,100
because you wanted to stay away from the court.

253
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,100
From this point of view,

254
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:19,100
your temperament with High Immortal is really similar.

255
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:22,100
You are indeed the most harmonious partner in the battle of the gods.

256
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:27,100
I'm not sure what's the matter with High Immortal coming to see High Immortal.

257
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:31,100
The ghost grass has been restored.

258
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:41,100
These ghost grass has completely transformed the body into a divine disease.

259
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,100
We must find the antidote as soon as possible,

260
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:46,100
or the entire city will become a divine disease.

261
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:48,100
The consequences are unimaginable.

262
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:50,100
But there are many types of ghost grass,

263
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:52,100
and the methods are different.

264
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:55,340
I've never heard of this kind of ghost grass called Ear-catching

265
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:57,100
How to find the antidote?

266
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,100
Little Mei Qiao, what's wrong?

267
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:07,100
Where are you taking us?

268
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:13,100
I was just wondering what this is.

269
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,100
Heart-wrenching.

270
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:17,100
Isn't it cute?

271
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:24,100
Where is it cute?

272
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:26,100
Little Mei Qiao, wait for me.

273
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:39,100
I've been here in Cai Qing's wild life.

274
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,100
This is where he buried his bones.

275
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:45,100
So this should be the ear-catching mother pig.

276
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,100
Little Mei Qiao, what are you looking for?

277
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:55,100
What is that?

278
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:07,100
Little Mei Qiao, you're amazing.

279
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,100
What is it?

280
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:15,100
Why did you know about the antidote?

281
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:17,100
It's a spirit bird. It's as talented as a cake.

282
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,100
Why are you so scared?

283
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:21,100
Why are you so scared?

284
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:25,100
Tian Xuan, you should know what it means to know about ghost grass.

285
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:29,100
We tried our best to get the information about ghost grass.

286
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,100
But it's a young bird. How did it know?

287
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:34,100
I'm afraid the demon is not here to confuse you.

288
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:36,100
If it's a demon's accomplice,

289
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:38,100
it wouldn't have tried to save me.

290
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,100
I believe it.

291
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:44,100
And I've already printed it.

292
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:46,100
If something goes wrong, I'll be responsible for it.

293
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,100
You...

294
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:51,100
I've check the testimony.

295
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:56,100
Aren't you scared?

296
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:58,100
So it went back and forth?

297
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:00,100
You've had an excuse, right?

298
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,100
In my heart...

299
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:06,100
I've got a child.

300
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:15,100
I respect your wish.

301
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:20,540
Getting to know yourself is important,

302
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,180
and you should find it rather than E Sak jan.

303
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,720
The vide recess for me hasair dependent,

304
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,780
you get my token to get help.

305
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:28,300
I'll take my leave

306
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:30,300
Shiyi Your councilor

307
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,060
Woah

308
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:40,340
I just made arrange some sugar in the water

309
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:41,580
因 ess s procession

310
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:43,060
to deflect shouldn't stop

311
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:43,940
annoyed

312
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:44,420
л

313
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,500
your newer 좀 too sweet

314
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,500
I'm fine.

315
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,500
It's fine.

316
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:51,500
You send someone to bring some antidote to the Water Village.

317
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:54,500
There are some villagers there who have been hit by the earplugs.

318
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,500
Yes, High Immortal.

319
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,500
It hurts!

320
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,500
Don't worry.

321
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,500
Why should I let them worry?

322
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,500
They deserve it!

323
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,500
There are so many innocent people in the town.

324
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,500
They deserve it too?

325
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,500
They are kind-hearted.

326
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,500
None of them is innocent.

327
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,500
What about Cai Qing's mother?

328
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:36,500
There is always a pillar of grass in the city.

329
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:39,500
Under it is the body of Cai Qing's mother.

330
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,500
No!

331
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,500
Don't say anymore!

332
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,500
I know.

333
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,500
You always know.

334
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:46,500
You just don't dare to think about it.

335
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,500
No!

336
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,500
Don't touch me!

337
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,500
Cai Qing is not worth it!

338
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,500
Cai Qing!

339
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,500
Cai Qing!

340
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,500
Come back!

341
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,500
I'm so worried!

342
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,500
Come back!

343
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:02,500
Another poor person who was used by the deep demon.

344
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:06,500
Only the deep demon knows the trouble of the world.

345
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,500
How can you know?

346
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:11,500
How can you know the heart of the human?

347
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:44,500
I'm so worried.

348
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,500
I'm so worried.

349
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,500
I'm so worried.

350
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,500
I'm so worried.

351
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,500
I'm so worried.

352
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,500
I'm so worried.

353
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,500
I'm so worried.

354
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,500
I'm so worried.

355
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,500
I'm so worried.

356
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,500
I'm so worried.

357
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,500
I'm so worried.

358
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,500
I'm so worried.

359
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,500
I'm so worried.

360
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,500
I'm so worried.

361
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,500
I'm so worried.

362
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,500
I'm so worried.

363
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,500
I'm so worried.

364
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,500
I'm so worried.

365
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,500
I'm so worried.

366
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,500
I'm so worried.

367
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,500
I'm so worried.

368
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,500
I'm so worried.

369
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,500
I'm so worried.

370
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,500
I'm so worried.

371
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,500
I'm so worried.

372
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,500
