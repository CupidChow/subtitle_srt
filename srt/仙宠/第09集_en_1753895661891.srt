1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I can't live without you

2
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I can't live without you

3
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I can't live without you

4
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I can't live without you

5
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I can't live without you

6
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I can't live without you

7
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I can't live without you

8
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I can't live without you

9
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Even if I'm not convinced, I won't ask where I'm going

10
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,000
The King's Avatar

00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Episode 28

12
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
The Deep Mountains

13
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You bastard

14
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
You know how to put the trouble on me

15
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
King of the Rings

16
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I've arranged a good job for you

17
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
A family lost a girl

18
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
If you find her, your merit this year will be complete

19
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Water

20
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Who can recognize this

21
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Water

22
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Water

23
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Water

24
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Water

25
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Hey, kid

26
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Do you know how to go to the Deep Mountains

27
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Water

28
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
What are you doing

29
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I didn't bring a water bag

30
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Don't be angry

31
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I'm just

32
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Hey, look at what you did

33
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
If it weren't for the master's order

34
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I can't do it to the mortal

35
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Water

36
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Water

37
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Hey, kid

38
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Don't go in the water

39
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
The water is dangerous

40
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Hey, stop

41
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Water

42
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Who

43
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Who are you

44
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Dare to harm people here

45
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Brother, I didn't harm anyone

46
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I'm just asking

47
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Still dare to argue

48
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I clearly saw you attacking him

49
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
You

50
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
He attacked me first

51
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
That kid is not right

52
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Don't block me

53
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Open the door

54
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Now

55
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Water

56
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Didn't your master teach you to use the water-shutting dream

57
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Thank you

58
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Follow me

59
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
There

60
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
What's going on

61
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Why can't you pull it

62
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Is there something stuck

63
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
It seems that it has not been stopped

64
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
What's wrong

65
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Go fast

66
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
You

67
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
You said that boy's eyes

68
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
How come flowers come out

69
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Is he still alive

70
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
What kind of flowered monster is breaking

71
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
You...

72
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,080
Do you recognize me?

73
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,440
Are you...

74
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,760
Senior Wei Li?

75
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,800
Senior Wei Li!

76
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,800
It's really you!

77
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,280
You don't recognize me?

78
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,040
I'm Shu Juan Juan!

79
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,320
We studied together in the Yingshan Academy for a year.

80
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,320
You forgot?

81
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,320
I'm a disciple of the Heavenly Palace.

82
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,040
How could I recognize you, a little fox?

83
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:45,880
Well...

84
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:46,880
Think about it.

85
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,800
I heard from Mr. Shu that you were looking for me.

86
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,800
You...

87
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,920
You...

88
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,920
Then...

89
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,800
I won't bother you anymore.

90
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,840
You really left just like that?

91
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:07,840
No...

92
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,440
Did you say that you don't recognize me?

93
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,040
You left just like that?

94
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,680
Shu Juan Juan, you're such a silly fox!

95
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,240
I... I'm not silly.

96
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,280
Then why didn't you recognize me at first sight?

97
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,080
You even asked me if I remembered you.

98
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,280
Shu, please listen to your fox.

99
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,480
Don't ever leave me alone again.

100
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,480
I...

101
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,880
I'm not blaming you for real.

102
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,880
Don't cry.

103
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,240
I thought...

104
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:38,840
I thought you really forgot about me!

105
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Do you know how happy I was to see you?

106
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,440
I was so miserable when you and your wife...

107
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,440
Okay, okay.

108
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,240
...said that to me!

109
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,720
I'm hungry.

110
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,720
I'm so hungry.

111
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,720
I'm so hungry.

112
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,720
I'm so hungry.

113
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,720
I'm so hungry.

114
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,720
I'm so hungry.

115
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,720
I'm so hungry.

116
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,720
I'm so hungry.

117
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,720
I'm so hungry.

118
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,720
I'm so hungry.

119
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,720
I'm so hungry.

120
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,720
I'm so hungry.

121
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,920
Shu,

122
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:11,920
did that red face really come from that child's eyes?

123
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,720
Juan Juan,

124
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,720
when you met that boy,

125
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,720
did you feel anything strange?

126
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,320
He's just a strong drug.

127
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,720
I thought he was really thirsty.

128
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,320
Drinking water?

129
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,720
Could it be...

130
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,120
A few days ago,

131
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,720
a child of about the same age broke into Tianyu Palace.

132
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,720
He had double eyelids and was unconscious.

133
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,720
I could only say that he was from the Sacred Mountain Village.

134
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,720
There was a demon there.

135
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,720
He pulled his eyes out and escaped.

136
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:46,720
He even asked us to go there to save a child called Bao Rong.

137
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,720
When we were going to send him to heal his wounds,

138
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,720
he suddenly went crazy.

139
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,720
He kept thinking about finding water.

140
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,720
Water!

141
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,720
He rushed to the waterfall next to it.

142
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,720
We couldn't catch him.

143
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,720
We also watched his water drown.

144
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:03,720
I saw a red flower in the water.

145
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,720
But the water was too big.

146
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,720
He was rushed away.

147
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,720
I didn't think about it.

148
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,720
I just came to the Sacred Mountain Village to investigate this matter.

149
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,720
Now it seems that these two people must have some connection.

150
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:20,720
We should be almost at the Sacred Mountain Village after passing through this forest.

151
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,720
That boy might also be from there.

152
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,720
I'm also going to the Sacred Mountain Village.

153
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,720
My master asked me to save a girl named Pei Yunzhou.

154
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,720
What is the Sacred Mountain Village?

155
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,720
Why is everyone going to have fun?

156
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:37,720
I've only heard some rumors about the Sacred Mountain Village.

157
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,720
24 years ago,

158
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,720
the old village head, Han Xian, met an immortal.

159
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:44,720
He got the red lotus seed.

160
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,720
This red lotus seed is only produced 12 li per year.

161
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:51,720
Every year, the Han family leaves six li for themselves and their families to use.

162
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,720
Since then, they have not grown old.

163
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,720
The other six li will be sold for a thousand gold.

164
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:01,720
Every year, the Han family will fight for this medicine.

165
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,720
This time, I went to the Sacred Mountain Village.

166
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,720
I was thinking of offering a sick brother a red lotus seed.

167
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,720
Red lotus seed?

168
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,720
Red lotus?

169
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,720
Could it be...

170
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,720
We can't make a conclusion with these.

171
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,720
But there must be something wrong with the Sacred Mountain Village.

172
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,720
Let's rest here tonight.

173
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,720
We'll be there as soon as it's dawn.

174
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,720
I've been in this forest for a day.

175
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,720
The fog never goes away.

176
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,720
There's a strange smell.

177
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,720
I can't find the way to the Sacred Mountain Village.

178
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,720
Don't worry. I'm here.

179
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,720
The fog is getting bigger.

180
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,720
This is a fog barrier.

181
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,720
Even we need to be careful.

182
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,720
I can't help it.

183
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,720
No wonder Zhao Qi had to poke his eyes out to escape.

184
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:58,720
Senior, you've become so good.

185
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,720
How did you get defeated at the Tianyu Palace?

186
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,720
I was looking for you.

187
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,720
Looking for me?

188
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,720
There are many disciples of the Tianyu Palace.

189
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,720
They're everywhere.

190
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,720
I've been dealing with the Demon Spirit the most.

191
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,720
I was thinking that if I got defeated at the Tianyu Palace,

192
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:20,720
I might be able to get your information.

193
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,720
So I asked my master,

194
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,720
the Princess of Tianyu Palace, Xiao Yuan Shan,

195
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,720
to be my disciple.

196
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,720
Senior.

197
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,720
Senior, actually I...

198
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,720
Juan Juan, we're out.

199
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,720
Water.

200
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,720
Water.

201
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,720
Hao Yulin,

202
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,720
keep going that way.

203
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,720
There's water there.

204
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,720
Whether you can escape or not

205
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,720
depends on your luck.

206
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,720
Water.

207
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,720
Water.

208
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,720
I'm going to get water.

209
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,720
I'm going to get water.

210
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,720
I'm going to get water.

211
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,720
I'm going to get water.

212
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,720
This is it!

213
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,720
You two.

214
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,720
How did you get here through the mist?

215
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,720
We are...

216
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,720
May I ask who is this?

217
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,720
It's useless.

218
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,720
I can't even control people.

219
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,720
Yesterday we escaped, and today we escape again.

220
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,720
Do you know that the un avoiding is going to cause a big problem?

221
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,680
It's all my fault.

222
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,120
Why don't you look at me?

223
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,280
This is an ominous place.

224
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,320
Please leave as soon as possible.

225
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,080
Don't think I don't know

226
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,360
what you are up to.

227
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,160
Stop arguing.

228
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,760
Maybe it's not far away.

229
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,800
You are...

230
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:02,880
I'm Shao Weili.

231
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,200
Little girl, Shu Juanjuan.

232
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,480
We are here to beg for red lotus seed.

233
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,000
How did you get through the fog?

234
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:09,840
You go first.

235
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,280
I'll deal with it.

236
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,920
What? How dare you!

237
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,080
Don't be rude in front of the guests.

238
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,120
I'm Han Baoyuan.

239
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,600
I'm not strict with my son.

240
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,640
I'm sorry.

241
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,640
It's you, Young Master.

242
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,560
I've been waiting for you.

243
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,840
You are here at the right time.

244
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,560
The red lotus seed this year

245
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,760
can be picked tomorrow.

246
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,400
Why don't you two

247
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,640
rest in the cold room today?

248
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,400
Thank you.

249
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,480
My father is in charge of receiving it.

250
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,840
He's been sick recently.

251
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:42,880
It's inconvenient for him to see guests.

252
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:44,840
Please take us to

253
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:45,840
Master Han.

254
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,640
Sure.

255
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,000
Young Master.

256
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,320
Why is there no servant

257
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,480
in your manor?

258
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,280
It's a valley in the middle of the land.

259
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,240
It's foggy in the north in summer.

260
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,560
It's inconvenient to go out.

261
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,640
There's no important thing at this time.

262
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,840
So I sent the servants back.

263
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,200
I heard you were looking for someone.

264
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,080
A maid stole money.

265
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,400
I don't know where she went.

266
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,760
I'm looking for her.

267
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,520
Have you seen her?

268
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:16,920
No.

269
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,840
But I met a crazy boy

270
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,440
in the forest ahead.

271
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,320
I don't know if he's from your manor.

272
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,280
How old is he?

273
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,320
Around 11 or 12 years old.

274
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,040
Is he a child?

275
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,520
That child got sick and ran out.

276
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,640
I was worried.

277
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,760
I don't know how he is.

278
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,680
He's completely drowned.

279
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,400
We can't save him.

280
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,720
What a poor boy.

281
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,080
We're not good at keeping him under control.

282
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,080
I'm sorry.

283
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,440
Baorong.

284
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,680
Baorong.

285
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,000
Come and welcome the guests.

286
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,480
Damn girl.

287
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,800
I don't know where she went.

288
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,880
Young Master.

289
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,080
Baorong is...

290
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,920
She's my sister.

291
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,560
She's in charge of taking care of the guests.

292
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,080
I'm going to find her.

293
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,480
You two came from afar.

294
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,000
You can have a rest here.

295
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,040
I'm exhausted.

296
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,240
After hearing what the Young Master said,

297
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,200
what do you think?

298
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,200
I'm tired.

299
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,200
I'm tired.

300
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,200
I'm tired.

301
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,200
I'm tired.

302
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,200
I'm tired.

303
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,520
What do you think?

304
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,800
What else can I think?

305
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,160
Liar.

306
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,200
I don't believe that's some kind of madness.

307
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,520
It seems that he doesn't want us to know

308
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,960
that there's something wrong with the mountain villa.

309
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,440
He even deliberately said that the tent was an ordinary big thing.

310
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,920
And when I said that the child in the woods died,

311
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,320
he was even very happy.

312
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,720
Could it be that he's the culprit?

313
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:04,200
It's too early to make a conclusion now.

314
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:07,680
That Young Master looks like he's twenty or thirty years old.

315
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,680
But he's very talkative.

316
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,280
His son is even more strange.

317
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,200
He dared to talk back to his father like that.

318
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,880
It's like he's scolding his son.

319
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:19,720
The Han family has their own red lotus seed to keep young.

320
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,520
They look young,

321
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,360
but they're old-fashioned.

322
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,000
But they look too bad.

323
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:27,840
By the way,

324
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:30,440
who's the girl we met at the door?

325
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,640
She wants us to leave,

326
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,840
but Young Master Han wants us to stay.

327
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,640
Please come in.

328
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:43,120
Young lady, you're Bao Rong?

329
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,320
Do you know a boy named Zhao Qi?

330
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,920
He's about your age.

331
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,120
Dear guests,

332
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,480
I've prepared some wine.

333
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,280
Please come in.

334
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,840
Young Master Han, you're here.

335
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:03,920
Please come with me.

336
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,320
We finally have food to eat.

337
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,320
Young lady, let's...

338
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,560
Let's...

339
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,560
Where are they?

340
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,160
Come on, please have a seat.

341
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,360
You're welcome.

342
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,600
Young Master,

343
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,240
who's that?

344
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,240
That's my twin sister, Han Bao Rong.

345
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,080
I've mentioned to you before

346
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,320
that she's in charge of the food in the manor.

347
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,360
Senior.

348
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,640
What happened?

349
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,240
To be honest,

350
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,560
a girl came to send you some pastries.

351
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,880
We thought she was Miss Bao Rong.

352
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,880
I think we've got the wrong person.

353
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,520
You must be joking.

354
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,760
You've met everyone in the family.

355
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,360
There's no girl.

356
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,800
That's true.

357
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,520
She's probably so tall.

358
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,640
She's wearing pink.

359
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,640
She's cute.

360
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,240
She's probably a kid from the nearby village.

361
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,440
She came to play.

362
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,520
I remember there's something I haven't done.

363
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,320
Please enjoy.

364
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,520
I'll be right back.

365
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,320
Why would a girl

366
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,440
make her so nervous?

367
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,320
Did she go to find that girl?

368
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,520
It's possible.

369
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,480
Besides,

370
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,960
she said we've met

371
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,640
the old man.

372
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,640
Don't you find it strange?

373
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,160
After we came here,

374
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,920
we've met Han Bao Yuan himself.

375
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,320
Han Bao Yuan's son.

376
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,280
Han Bao Yuan's sister, Han Bao Rong.

377
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,880
And a little sister with an unknown identity.

378
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,280
But there's one person

379
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,680
we've never met before.

380
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,440
Who?

381
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,920
An old man with a bad health

382
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,960
and an inconvenient swordsman.

383
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:57,640
Han Xian.

384
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,800
You're so bold.

385
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,640
You haven't left yet.

386
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,480
Miss Bao Rong.

387
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,280
I know you're capable.

388
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,760
If you can break this barrier,

389
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,120
you'd better leave now.

390
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:10,560
Or else, you'll be late.

391
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,640
Miss Bao Rong.

392
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,840
We came here

393
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:13,920
to save you.

394
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,160
Save me?

395
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,160
Yes.

396
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,760
Zhao Qi asked us to save you.

397
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,440
Zhao Qi.

398
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,240
I'm a cultivator in Tianyu Palace.

399
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,560
Zhao Qi came to Tianyu Palace to ask for help a few days ago.

400
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,840
I came to investigate under the order of my master.

401
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:30,840
I'm sorry.

402
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:31,840
I'm sorry.

403
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,160
Zhao Qi.

404
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,680
He didn't steal the grass.

405
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,400
He asked someone to save me.

406
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,960
I misunderstood him.

407
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,240
Zhao Qi said there's a demon in the mountain villa.

408
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,600
Miss Bao Rong, please

409
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,400
tell the truth.

410
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:48,360
Then, we'll have a chance to change.

411
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,360
Zhao Qi.

412
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,680
Is he okay now?

413
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:54,960
He's been blinded

414
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,080
since he came here.

415
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,640
He'll be in a coma soon.

416
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,760
Really?

417
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,640
That's why he ran out.

418
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:08,520
So what if he ran out?

419
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,640
He still didn't escape.

420
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,800
We met a boy

421
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,480
who was drowning by the river.

422
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,480
He's also from the mountain villa.

423
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,600
He's Wan Zi.

424
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,560
He's a servant of the mountain villa.

425
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:24,400
Why are those children drowning?

426
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,600
What happened here?

427
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,080
What kind of children are they?

428
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,320
You guys go.

429
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,080
I don't need you to go.

430
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:35,720
Everyone in the mountain villa

431
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:38,480
is destined to be buried in mud.

432
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,640
We came to save him.

433
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,440
Why doesn't he

434
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,600
tell the truth?

435
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,760
There are many secrets in the mountain villa.

436
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,320
Anyway, we found Bao Rong.

437
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,800
But where's Pei Yun Zhou?

438
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,080
Could it be that girl?

439
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:56,280
Han Bao Yuan ran out in a hurry.

440
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,360
I wonder if that girl

441
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,400
is in trouble.

442
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,400
Go and check.

443
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,320
Come here.

444
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,240
Zhao Qi.

445
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:13,280
You're silly.

446
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:13,600
Mom.

447
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,640
We will be together

448
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,800
forever soon.

449
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,560
Where did the

450
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,480
hanbao yuan go?

451
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,920
I think I heard something.
