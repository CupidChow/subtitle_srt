1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,480
It's been ten years since I've tasted the taste of being human.

2
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,840
It's better to be human.

3
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
The Legend of Chusen

4
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Episode 16

5
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
The immortal in the Moon Palace

6
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,680
actually got possessed by a ghost.

7
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,160
It's not funny to say it out.

8
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,320
Be gentle.

9
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,800
My ears are the most sensitive part.

10
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,800
The earlobe is really powerful.

11
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,440
I was thinking about how the High Immortal would report on the situation in Luoyi Town.

12
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,840
But there's always a voice in my ear that tells me not to say it.

13
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,280
I really can't say anything.

14
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,680
So, what's the point of keeping you?

15
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,360
Mianmian.

16
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,600
You're not being fair.

17
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,840
I always help you with your work.

18
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,120
What did you help me with?

19
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,320
You're taking off the ground. I'm lifting my legs.

20
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,240
You're frying the food. I'm cooking on time.

21
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,280
The little ball has been sleeping since it came back.

22
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,520
It seems that it was too tired before.

23
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,240
Juanjuan, he knows the ghost grass so well.

24
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,240
What's his background?

25
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,520
Minister Si Shouguan, this way please.

26
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,960
Coming.

27
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,440
I dare to ask you, where did you find this bird?

28
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,440
It's a coincidence.

29
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,120
This bird is the legendary

30
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,760
Spirit Bird, Li Xiao?

31
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,040
Li Xiao?

32
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,600
It sounds so powerful.

33
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,600
Did I find the treasure?

34
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,400
There's a saying in the Talisman and Life Path,

35
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,160
those who change their destiny will be rare in the three realms.

36
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:03,480
Li Xiao is one of them.

37
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,960
He was born after the Heavenly Emperor's request for life,

38
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,440
he's an indispensable Spirit Bird.

39
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:13,400
It's said that Li Xiao's past life was full of blood and hatred,

40
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,840
and he will never forget it.

41
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,480
He only...

42
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,480
He only wants revenge.

43
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,400
Mom.

44
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:25,360
You mean I might have found an enemy?

45
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,480
But that's a legend,

46
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,480
you don't have to take it seriously.

47
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:34,000
Did the legend mention that he knows medicine and herbs?

48
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,600
I've never heard of that.

49
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,640
But Li Xiao is rare indeed.

50
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:43,880
I wonder if you'd like to lend me this Spirit Bird

51
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,640
so that I can observe it carefully.

52
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:49,920
I can definitely find out everything about it.

53
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,600
See him out.

54
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,480
Mr. Sui Shougua,

55
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,880
what are you doing?

56
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,520
If I can remember everything about the Talisman and Life Path,

57
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:03,040
it would be a great achievement.

58
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,960
Young Master!

59
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,800
Are you really here to ask me for money?

60
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,120
Juanjuan.

61
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,800
Hong Mengtian sent someone to send you the love money?

62
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,600
The flower of the Three Thousand Jade Emperors

63
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,400
bloomed before the Buddha of the Vajra.

64
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,280
What does it say?

65
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,720
The flower of the Puroha.

66
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,080
It bloomed in a thousand years,

67
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,280
and bloomed in two thousand years.

68
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,280
It bloomed once in three thousand years.

69
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,800
It blooms only once a night.

70
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,320
It will wither in a day.

71
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,200
Even if it's as long as a immortal,

72
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,320
it might not bloom in a single flower.

73
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,320
Tomorrow, on the Mid-Autumn Festival night,

74
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,320
the flower of the Puroha will bloom.

75
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,320
I see.

76
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,320
I see.

77
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,320
I see.

78
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,320
I see.

79
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,040
It's the flower of the Puroha.

80
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,040
Oh!

81
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,480
So, the Empress is going to hold a small banquet tomorrow?

82
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,480
Yes.

83
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,640
I finally have a chance to wear the most satisfying dress

84
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,840
for Juanjuan.

85
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,840
I must dress you up this time.

86
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,640
I didn't have time to put on the dress I made for you last time.

87
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,640
Oh, what a pity!

88
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,640
This time,

89
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,640
I will definitely make you...

90
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,160
Puroha.

91
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,720
Senior Brother!

92
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,920
There are so many flowers and cakes.

93
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:23,320
We are so lucky.

94
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,120
We should show them.

95
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,720
Maybe we can find someone who is destined to be our lover.

96
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,120
We will see Lord Jingshun today.

97
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,320
What's so good about him?

98
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:36,320
Lord Jingshun is the strongest God of War in the Heaven Realm.

99
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,320
He is so elegant and elegant.

100
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,920
He is like a moon and a star wherever he goes.

101
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,320
He is so attractive.

102
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,520
His two fairies are always showing off.

103
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,320
That's right.

104
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,920
Cheng Tianban, you are so shameless.

105
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,920
It seems that everyone owes him money.

106
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,720
I will find Kunpeng as my wife one day.

107
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,720
I will step on his foot.

108
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,120
Is Little Mermaid still sleeping?

109
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,320
She woke up this morning.

110
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,520
She ate a lot of food.

111
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,120
She should be fine now.

112
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,920
I don't know where she went to play.

113
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,320
After all, she is still a little bird.

114
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,320
I'm leaving.

115
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,520
Take good care of her.

116
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,520
Don't worry.

117
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,920
Wen Ren.

118
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,920
Who are you?

119
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,920
Didn't we meet before?

120
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,920
Don't come inside.

121
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,320
The sleeve is very popular in Kerry today.

122
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,320
Wow.

123
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,520
You look fat.

124
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,520
Mermaid, Chang'er, Mao Jun,

125
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,640
I am back.

126
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,120
Xiao Si!

127
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,400
After the banquet,

128
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,600
the Heavenly Emperor and the Heavenly Empress will come here

129
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,000
to enjoy the view of flowers blooming.

130
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,240
I wonder who it is.

131
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,040
It's so bright and moving.

132
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,240
You saw it too.

133
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,840
I noticed it just now.

134
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,440
I feel that it's a bit familiar.

135
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,840
It's a bit familiar.

136
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,160
I feel that it's a bit familiar.

137
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,360
In a sense, I shouldn't be able to meet

138
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,680
such a beautiful fairy.

139
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,400
You guys are really shallow in your knowledge.

140
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,280
She is the god of the gods

141
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,360
who killed the god of the gods in the battle of the gods.

142
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,640
Tian Quan.

143
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,720
This...

144
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,280
It's actually that god of war.

145
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,880
I really can't tell.

146
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,920
You say that after the war ended,

147
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,640
she was taken over by the Heavenly Emperor

148
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,280
and exiled to the mortal world to be a landlady.

149
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,920
Don't talk about the Heavenly Emperor.

150
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,760
Be careful of getting into trouble.

151
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,040
So it's the famous god of Tian Quan.

152
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,640
I knew it.

153
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,120
This hair roll...

154
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,640
It's really annoying.

155
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,160
Sorry.

156
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,160
Thank you.

157
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,560
You don't have to be angry.

158
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,160
This hair roll is really beautiful.

159
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,720
Immortal.

160
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,720
How is it?

161
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,520
You went out for almost a year this time.

162
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,520
Did you find the whereabouts of Young Master?

163
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,520
I didn't.

164
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,720
I didn't find him.

165
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,720
I didn't find him.

166
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,720
Did you find the whereabouts of Young Master?

167
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,320
I didn't find him.

168
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,520
Could it be that your sense of smell is wrong?

169
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,720
You are a filial son of the god of heaven.

170
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,920
No matter who you are,

171
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:51,520
no one dares to be the first in heaven and earth.

172
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,720
Do you think everyone is as useless as you?

173
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,720
I'm useless.

174
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,520
Young Master saved my life.

175
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,520
I can't even help him with this.

176
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,920
You don't have to blame yourself.

177
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,320
You almost changed the entire Cangshuo land.

178
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,720
It's not your fault that you can't find Young Master.

179
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:13,320
I just think he is the only one in this life.

180
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:16,920
I'm afraid he can't let go of it no matter what.

181
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,120
Today is the Mid-Autumn Festival.

182
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,520
And we have the chance to meet the beautiful flowers.

183
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:34,520
It's a rare opportunity.

184
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,520
We are lucky to have the company of the immortals.

185
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,120
I'm very happy.

186
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:41,520
You all should be happy.

187
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,520
Thank you, Heavenly Emperor.

188
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:48,520
It's been a while since I saw you.

189
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,520
You have done a good job in the battle of the gods and earth.

190
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,520
You should have been promoted to the imperial official.

191
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:56,520
But you had to go to the mortal world to get the decree of the Situ Queen.

192
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:59,520
You said you liked the mortal world the most.

193
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:03,520
After you left, the Red Alliance has become much more calm.

194
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:27,340
I'm used to it. I can't stand the

195
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,520
fun of the immortals.

196
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,320
Yes, Your Majesty.

197
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:42,520
Tianquan, you are too focused on the official affairs.

198
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,520
Why are you alone now?

199
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:47,520
Isn't it a waste of time?

200
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,520
You are right.

201
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:55,520
Tianquan, you are getting old.

202
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,520
Do you have a husband you like?

203
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,520
I will make the decision for you.

204
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,520
I'm still young.

205
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,520
I'm not in a hurry.

206
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,520
I'll help you if you're not in a hurry.

207
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,520
While the immortals are gathering today,

208
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,520
you should choose a good one.

209
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,520
Maybe there is something suitable.

210
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,520
No need, Your Majesty.

211
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,520
Our Heavenly Dog is famous.

212
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,520
The country is beautiful.

213
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,520
Ordinary people can't match it.

214
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:25,520
You should be noble and upright.

215
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,520
You should be both civil and military.

216
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,520
Lord Jingshun,

217
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,520
how could I forget you?

218
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,520
Your Majesty,

219
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,520
look at Lord Jingshun.

220
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,520
He is a perfect match for us.

221
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:45,520
Yes, you are the best friends on the battlefield.

222
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:48,520
I'm sure you can take care of each other in life.

223
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,520
Why don't you...

224
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,520
Lord Jingshun is a great warrior.

225
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,520
He is a brilliant and talented man.

226
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,520
But I...

227
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,520
I'm allergic to fox fur.

228
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,520
Especially...

229
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,520
the fur on your hair.

230
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,520
Lord Jingshun is so humorous.

231
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,520
Although Lord Jingshun is not loyal,

232
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:19,520
I'm loyal to Lord Jingshun.

233
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,520
Oh, my god.

234
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:29,520
This handsome boy has been staying with me for a long time.

235
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:32,520
How do you think of me?

236
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,520
What?

237
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,520
What's going on?

238
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,520
The old cow eats the grass?

239
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,520
It's so late in the garden.

240
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,520
Did he get angry with Lord Jingshun

241
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,520
and get angry on purpose?

242
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,520
I...

243
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,520
What's wrong with this kid?

244
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,520
What happened?

245
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,520
Your Highness,

246
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:04,520
I don't know who is making a fuss about the horse riding.

247
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,520
I'm afraid the people are being rude.

248
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,520
I'll go and solve it.

249
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,520
Your Majesty,

250
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,520
I have something to do in the palace.

251
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,520
I'll go first.

252
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,520
Tianquan,

253
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,520
the conversation is about to start.

254
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,520
You don't have to watch it.

255
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,520
No, no.

256
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,520
He is still so angry.

257
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,520
Let him go.

258
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,520
Immortal, please wait.

259
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,520
Immortal.

260
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,520
It's you.

261
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,520
What's up?

262
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,520
Well, just now...

263
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,520
It was just a joke.

264
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,520
Don't take it seriously.

265
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,520
Yes.

266
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,520
It was a joke.

267
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,520
How dare I say hello to you?

268
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,520
But I swear,

269
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,520
I'll do my best to train.

270
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,520
I won't slack off.

271
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,520
One day...

272
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,520
Good, Yunjiao.

273
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,520
It's good for the young.

274
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,520
Good luck.

275
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,520
Good luck.

276
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:17,520
You are so generous.

277
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:20,520
No wonder she likes you so much.

278
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,520
Your sister?

279
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,520
Yes.

280
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,520
Speaking of which,

281
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,520
I haven't thanked you

282
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,520
for saving my life.

283
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:33,520
Do you remember Yunzhou?

284
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:36,520
Yunzhou?

285
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:41,520
Pei Yunzhou and Pei Yunjiao.

286
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,520
I see.

287
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,520
Yunzhou, how is she?

288
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,520
She was shot by a monster.

289
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,520
She has a cold.

290
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,520
She is a little weak.

291
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,520
But she is content.

292
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:56,520
She wants to invite you to the Yaoguang Mirror.

293
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,520
Okay.

294
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,520
I'll go to see her.

295
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,520
Great.

296
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,520
Yunzhou will be happy.

297
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,520
The flower of the Youtan Hall is about to bloom.

298
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,520
I wonder if Yunjiao is lucky

299
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,520
to have the flowers.

300
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,520
Is it this one?

301
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,520
This one.

302
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,520
My master is going back to the palace.

303
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,520
If you have something to do,

304
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,520
please come back another day.

305
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,520
The Moon Palace will be waiting for you.

306
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,520
Goodbye.

307
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,520
Didn't you say that

308
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:56,280
a huge black

309
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,280
monster came.

310
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,280
Hey.

311
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,280
Look at this.

312
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:14,280
Who are you? Let me go.

313
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,280
It's you.

314
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,280
You came prepared, right?

315
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,280
Let me tell you.

316
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,360
I'll beat you up if I see you again.

317
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,680
Shi Xiangdu, go.

318
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,000
Kele is a fool.

319
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:32,960
I'll go if you don't.

320
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:39,480
One, two, three.

321
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,560
So beautiful.

322
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,560
So beautiful.

323
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,760
Shi Xiangdu, you're so beautiful.

324
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:55,760
It's so beautiful

325
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,760
in this world.

326
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:02,360
Juanjuan, I'll take you home.

327
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:02,960
You?

328
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:07,560
Xiao...

329
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,360
Xiao... Xiao Meiqiu?

330
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,560
How can you...

331
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16,160
He's so handsome.

332
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,160
Come on.

333
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,960
I'm flying.

334
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,960
You're going to fly.

335
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:40,760
Hurry up.

336
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,360
I'm going to pass the test.

337
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,360
I'm flying.

338
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,160
I'm back in the Moon Palace.

339
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,160
Senior, you're back.

340
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:07,560
Be careful.

341
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,560
Senior, where are you going?

342
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,760
Master was looking for you.

343
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,760
Are you back?

344
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,960
Today is the Mid-Autumn Festival.

345
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:19,160
We have to give more food and moon cakes to the temple.

346
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,360
Besides,

347
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:22,960
those who come to my Yaoguangjing today

348
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,160
will be well-prepared

349
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,960
no matter how expensive they are.

350
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:26,760
Yes.

351
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,760
Master, I'm back.

352
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:35,760
You brat, where are you going?

353
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:38,560
Don't you know there are many things to be arranged today?

354
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,160
What's in your hand?

355
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:41,960
Senior.

356
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,560
Senior, I brought you osmanthus wine.

357
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,360
I'm flattered.

358
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,360
I don't dare to be late.

359
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,760
Yunzhou, you're not in good health.

360
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,160
You'd better drink less.

361
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:57,560
Father, I've been drinking osmanthus wine for a year.

362
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,960
It's rare to have a festival in the Mid-Autumn Festival.

363
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,360
Let me drink a little.

364
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,360
You...

365
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,360
I'm sorry.

366
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,360
I'm sorry.

367
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,360
I'm sorry.

368
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,360
I'm sorry.

369
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,360
I'm sorry.

370
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,360
I'm sorry.

371
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,360
I'm sorry.

372
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,360
I'm sorry.
