00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:15,120
It's just...

4
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,600
Thank you, sir.

5
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,520
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

6
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:49,520
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

7
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,520
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:55,520
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,520
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:01,520
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,520
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

12
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:07,520
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

13
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,520
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

14
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:13,520
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

15
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,520
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

16
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:19,520
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

17
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,520
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

18
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,520
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

19
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,520
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

20
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:31,520
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

21
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,520
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

22
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:37,520
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

23
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,520
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

24
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:43,520
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

25
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,520
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

26
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:49,520
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

27
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,520
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

28
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:55,520
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

29
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,520
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

30
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:01,520
I'm afraid that I can't protect you.

31
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,520

The Taoism Grandmaster

00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,520
Episode 16

34
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:20,520
In the shabby temple that is hidden from the eye,

35
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:24,520
that lady lit a candle.

36
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,520
Suddenly, the candle went out.

37
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:31,520
She lit the candle again.

38
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,520
But the candle went out again.

39
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,520
She lit the candle again and again.

40
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,520
The candle went out again and again.

41
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,520
When she finally lit the candle,

42
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,520
she carefully poked into the wall.

43
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,520
It doesn't matter.

44
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:53,520
Who knows that the wall actually...

45
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,520
actually...

46
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,520
What's wrong?

47
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,520
Over there.

48
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:26,520
That's right.

49
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:29,520
Hello, everyone. I'm Li Xiao.

50
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,520
You're a young bird with low magical power.

51
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,520
How could you turn into an adult man?

52
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,520
Did I inject too much spiritual power?

53
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,520
My lovely little girl.

54
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,520
What's so good about a little girl?

55
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,520
Xiao Si!

56
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,520
Master!

57
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,520
Master!

58
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,520
Really?

59
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,520
I didn't get anything this year.

60
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,520
Master, don't be discouraged.

61
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,520
I won't give up.

62
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,520
No matter where I am, I'll find the young bird.

63
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,520
Thank you.

64
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,520
You'll have two more days to rest.

65
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,520
What are you doing?

66
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,520
Just talk. Don't keep going up.

67
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:51,520
You're new here. You're so arrogant.

68
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,520
Hmm.

69
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,520
It's so lively this year.

70
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,520
Oh, right.

71
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,520
Wow!

72
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,520
Wow!

73
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,520
Wow!

74
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,520
Wow!

75
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,520
Xuan Juan, this is...

76
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,520
Lord Dijun made a plum for me.

77
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,520
I'll pick some yutang flowers for him.

78
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,520
Here.

79
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,520
Thank you.

80
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,520
Xuan Juan!

81
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,520
You'd better teach this stupid man a lesson!

82
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,520
He ate the flowers!

83
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,520
It's not that bad.

84
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,520
Please, please, Master.

85
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,520
Please, please, spare me.

86
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,520
My mother...

87
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,520
My mother is still waiting for my medicine at home.

88
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,520
Please, please, Master.

89
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,520
Please, please, Master.

90
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,520
Master.

91
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,520
Master.

92
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,520
Master.

93
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,520
Master.

94
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,520
Master.

95
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,520
Master.

96
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,520
Master.

97
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,520
Master.

98
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,520
Master.

99
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,520
Master.

100
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,520
Master.

101
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,520
Master.

102
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,520
Master.

103
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,520
Master.

104
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,520
Master.

105
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,520
Master.

106
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,520
Master.

107
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,520
Master.

108
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,520
Master.

109
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,520
Master.

110
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,520
Master.

111
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,520
Master.

112
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,520
Master.

113
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,520
Master.

114
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,520
Master.

115
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,520
Master.

116
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,520
Master.

117
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,520
Master.

118
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,520
Master.

119
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,520
Qian, Qian.

120
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,520
ê±¸ê±°ê¸°

121
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,520
Sorry.

122
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,520
Huh?

123
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,520
Qian, Qian.

124
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,520
Huh?

125
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,520
Qian, Qian.

126
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,520
What's wrong?

127
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,520
What happened?

128
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,520
I'll cancel it.

129
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,520
Qian, Qian.

130
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,520
Qian, Qian.

131
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,520
Qian, Qian.

132
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,520
Ah...

133
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,520
Qian, Qian.

134
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,520
Qian, Qian.

135
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,520
Qian, Qian.

136
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,520
Oh, Qian.

137
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,520
Qian, Qian.

138
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,520
Ah!

139
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,520
Qian.

140
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,520
Qian.

141
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,520
Qian.

142
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,520
Ah!

143
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,520
Ah!

144
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,520
Qian, Qian.

145
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,520
Where are we going?

146
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,520
The front is the land that I'm going to inherit.

147
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:56,520
Your master and I are the private land of the southern border.

148
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,520
We're here to learn about the hardships of the common people.

149
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,520
It's also my job.

150
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,520
Oh, right.

151
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,520
What were you doing in the garden last night?

152
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,520
Immortal.

153
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,520
Mao Jun, what's wrong?

154
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,520
These people are...

155
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,520
The war that happened this time was fierce.

156
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,520
The medicine in the city has reached the heaven price.

157
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,520
These patients can't afford the medicine.

158
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,520
They can only come to the temple to pray to the Buddha.

159
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,520
These people are suffering.

160
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,520
You guys eat more medicine and porridge.

161
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,520
Yes.

162
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,520
Mother, hurry and drink a sip.

163
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,520
I'm not going to drink it.

164
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,520
Mother, hurry and drink a sip.

165
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,520
This is the famous immortal fist.

166
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,520
After drinking it, your illness will be cured very quickly.

167
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,520
Ying'er.

168
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,520
What immortal fist?

169
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,520
It's just a normal spring water.

170
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,520
It can't cure any illness.

171
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,520
Nonsense! This is an immortal fist.

172
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,520
Old people always say that.

173
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,520
If this immortal fist is effective,

174
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,520
my mother won't...

175
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,520
Mother, don't listen to him.

176
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,520
I'm just a little bit drunk.

177
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,520
This spring water can't cure your mother.

178
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,520
Li Xiao!

179
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,520
But, if you believe me,

180
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,520
I'm willing to try.

181
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,520
Can you do it?

182
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,520
Don't say anything big.

183
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,520
How about

184
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,520
we give him a chance to try?

185
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,520
Mother, the cake that Sister Shu just sent over

186
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,520
is very hot.

187
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,520
You should take a bite.

188
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,520
You're really something.

189
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,520
You really have a bright future.

190
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,520
I heard that some famous doctors in the city

191
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,520
couldn't come up with a good prescription.

192
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,520
I didn't expect your medicine to be effective so quickly.

193
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,520
Actually,

194
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,520
I should give it a try.

195
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,520
Me?

196
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,520
Thanks to the yutang flower you brought back last night.

197
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,520
Yutang flower is a rare herb that's hard to find.

198
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,520
It can greatly enhance the effectiveness of ordinary herbs.

199
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,520
That's not right.

200
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,520
Didn't the yutang flower

201
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,520
go out overnight?

202
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,520
It's a pity that it went out overnight.

203
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,520
I took care of them before dawn.

204
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,520
I just didn't expect to be able to shoot a movie today.

205
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,520
What?

206
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,520
You said that you haven't been able to

207
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,520
take care of the birds for a few days.

208
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,520
Where did you get so much skill?

209
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,520
What's going on?

210
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,520
Weren't you fine just now?

211
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,520
I don't know.

212
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,520
They suddenly...

213
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,520
Why did they suddenly become so heavy?

214
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,520
The pulse and symptoms are obviously the same.

215
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,520
But why didn't the prescription work?

216
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,520
The symptoms

217
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,520
were obviously eased before.

218
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,520
Why did they suddenly become so heavy?

219
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,520
The medicine's mother and the other ten patients

220
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,520
have been cured.

221
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,520
The prescription should be the right one.

222
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,520
How?

223
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,520
I'm not sure.

224
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,520
I'm not sure.

225
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,520
I'm not sure.

226
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,520
I'm not sure.

227
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,520
I'm not sure.

228
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,520
How?

229
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,520
I must have missed something.

230
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,520
What is it?

231
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,520
Mother, I'm thirsty.

232
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,520
Okay, I'll get you some water.

233
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,520
Yao!

234
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,520
Yao!

235
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:49,080
It seems that the poison is from the

236
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,080
Yao!

237
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,080
Yao!

238
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,080
Yao!

239
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,080
What's wrong with you?

240
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,080
I'm fine now.

241
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,080
Hello.

242
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,080
I'm Yao.

243
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:29,580
I went to the hospital just vegetable matter

244
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:31,300
to get the prescription.

245
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,740
You need to bring me right away!

246
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,740
Thank you.

247
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:38,740
You even went on to give labor difficulties trouble.

248
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,740
Alright.

249
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:42,100
Take it easy, okay?

250
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:44,820
Don't worry.

251
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,040
Hurry!

252
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,240
I'm just worried about Xin Chengzhuang.

253
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,880
You haven't slept for three days.

254
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,280
Go and have a rest.

255
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,000
I'm sorry.

256
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,560
I let you down.

257
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,360
How can I blame you?

258
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,760
Go and have a rest.

259
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,440
Maybe you can figure out a way.

260
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:16,600
What's wrong?

261
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,000
This is it.

262
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,000
I missed it.

263
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,160
This is it.

264
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,240
Lin Xiao.

265
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,760
Lin Xiao, where are you going?

266
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,680
What are you looking for?

267
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,200
I want to verify something.

268
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,520
What is it?

269
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,720
A general dance of raping patients.

270
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,480
It won't be like Yaoer.

271
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:52,000
It's like the water in her body is dried up.

272
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,360
She's very dehydrated.

273
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,920
But she has a lot of water.

274
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,200
I found it.

275
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,600
Yaoer was biting someone just now.

276
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,960
It's not that she's sick and she's in a mess.

277
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:11,400
It's more like she wants to get water from another path.

278
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,800
You mean it's blood?

279
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,040
Did you think of anything?

280
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:17,680
Ghost grass?

281
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:19,480
Yes.

282
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,960
But I can't confirm what kind of ghost grass it is.

283
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:26,160
Until I saw your arm.

284
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,080
The roll is a real fairy's body.

285
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:32,080
How can it react to ordinary mosquitoes and bugs?

286
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,240
I just remembered

287
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,320
there's a very rare ghost grass.

288
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,600
It's called Qianming incense.

289
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,120
Lin Xiao, what are you doing?

290
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,640
You are doing this again?

291
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,000
Lin Xiao, why did you kill her?

292
00:16:50,240 --> 00:17:07,280
You are a snake and it's

293
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,360
Lin Xiao!

294
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,280
I'm alright.

295
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,360
Qianming incense grows between the coat of arms.

296
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:15,520
The poison will spread.

297
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,520
After being poisoned,

298
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,520
within three days,

299
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,160
the person will turn into a living corpse

300
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,160
who has just shed blood.

301
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,480
To cure the poison of the incense,

302
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,680
we need these poisons.

303
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:26,960
As expected,

304
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,000
the incense I just swallowed

305
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,160
mixed with my blood

306
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,600
and brought them all here.

307
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,760
These are all important herbs.

308
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,360
Juanjuan, you must be careful of the fire.

309
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,160
Leave it to me.

310
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,080
Luo Yun Jian!

311
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,000
Come on!

312
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,360
Episode 15

313
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,360
What do you want?

314
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:23,960
Thank you.

315
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,760
This is the poison that was infected by the ghost grass?

316
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,760
It's indeed much bigger than a common mosquito.

317
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,960
Take the poison and let the cicada eat it.

318
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,160
Then take the cicada's poison and put it in the medicine.

319
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,160
Then it can relieve the poison of the incense.

320
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,160
That's great, Li Xiao.

321
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,160
The medicine is awake.

322
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,560
Kid, you're not bad.

323
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,560
You're quite good.

324
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,560
You're not bad either.

325
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:04,760
I asked for you to go to the city to ask for help from the rich families.

326
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:05,760
Actually...

327
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,760
No.

328
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,760
What is it?

329
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,560
I wrote it for you.

330
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,560
No need.

331
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:20,560
I'm sure you'll be interested after reading the first page.

332
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,360
It hurts!

333
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,360
It hurts!

334
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:43,760
It hurts!

335
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:58,760
My Lord.

336
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:07,760
Why are your ghost grass being broken repeatedly?

337
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:09,760
My Lord, please calm down.

338
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,760
I tried my best to save you.

339
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,760
I gathered your broken body

340
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,760
and provided you with a body for the fire.

341
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,760
It's just because you have

342
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:26,760
the only ghost grass in the world.

343
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,760
If I knew that

344
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,760
other people would use ghost grass

345
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,760
besides you,

346
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:37,760
you would have no value.

347
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,760
I know.

348
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:40,760
Do you understand?

349
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,760
Yes, I understand.

350
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:47,760
Tianquan has stopped Luo Yi Town.

351
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,760
I wanted to use this to punish

352
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,760
Huafeng Yu'an for being unreasonable.

353
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,760
But a pharmacist came out

354
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,760
and made the antidote.

355
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,760
The pharmacist is the black bird

356
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,760
that was with Tianquan

357
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,760
when Luo Yi Town was under attack.

358
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:04,760
What?

359
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,760
Keep an eye on him.

360
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:09,760
Find out his true identity.

361
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:10,760
Yes.

362
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,760
Minister Li, you've done a great job.

363
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,760
You not only cured the evil,

364
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:31,760
but also solved the ghost grass.

365
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,760
Now the name of the pharmacist has spread.

366
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,760
Those who go to the land to get the medicine

367
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,760
are Luo Yi's men.

368
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:43,760
If you didn't save me back then,

369
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:49,760
would he be a god now?

370
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:55,760
Juanjuan,

371
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,760
the ghost grass is showing up again.

372
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,760
Are we...

373
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,760
Are we...

374
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,760
Are we...

375
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,760
Are we...

376
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,760
Mr. Li,

377
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,760
come and fly again.
