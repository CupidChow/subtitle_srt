Episode 18

57
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Teacher.

58
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
You have to do it.

59
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Bai Maohu sent it.

60
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Gu Xiaoshan

61
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Gu Xiaoshan.

62
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
This is the second time you use your mother to threaten me.

63
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
There will be a car outside the door.

64
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
You can leave in this car.

65
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I haven't started this show yet.

66
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I will be the one to call the shots.

67
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Don't forget.

68
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
You are a runaway.

69
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
If you dare to touch my mother,

70
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I, a runaway,

71
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
can also make your life happy.

72
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
In Sanyang.

73
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Gu Xiaoshan

74
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
What do you want?

75
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
The anti-Japanese who killed Mr. Cao Wen have been arrested.

76
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Now, the Prime Minister suspects that he has something to do with Mr. Li.

77
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Please finish the case immediately.

78
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Take the interrogation.

79
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Gu Xiaoshan

80
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Didn't the Prime Minister come to me?

81
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Why didn't I hear his voice?

82
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
The Prime Minister received an emergency call.

83
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
He will be back after the interrogation.

84
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Mr. Li.

85
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
The people in this station have already been searched.

86
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
They say you are...

87
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
A Communist.

88
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
You are...

89
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
A communist.

90
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Who is the one in there?

91
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Who is your communist among these people?

92
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Get down!

93
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Get down!

94
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Si Teng is a son of a Chinese.

95
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
But he doesn't reveal his true identity.

96
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
He is destined not to die today.

97
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Don't kill him.

98
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I...

99
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I...

100
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
The storm this time...

101
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Is between us.

102
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
You are a Communist.

103
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
You are...

104
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
A member of the Chinese Communist Party.

105
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
My name is...

106
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
You are...

107
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Li Si.

108
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Li Si.

109
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
We stand together against the Chinese Communist Party.

110
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
This is the battle of our action team.

111
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
The location of the street is in Yingke.

112
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
The Chinese Communist Party is in Yingke.

113
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
The Chinese Communist Party is in Yingke.

114
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
The Chinese Communist Party is in Yingke.

115
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
The Chinese Communist Party is in Yingke.

116
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
The Chinese Communist Party is in Yingke.

117
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
The Chinese Communist Party is in Yingke.

118
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
The Chinese Communist Party is in Yingke.

119
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
The Chinese Communist Party is in Yingke.

120
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
The Chinese Communist Party is in Yingke.

121
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
The Chinese Communist Party is in Yingke.

122
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
The Chinese Communist Party is in Yingke.

123
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
What is he saying?

124
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I...

125
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I'm not a traitor.

126
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I...

127
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I can't hold it any longer.

128
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I can't see what I'm doing now.

129
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I'd rather die than live.

130
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I...

131
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I don't want to die.

132
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
It's ridiculous.

133
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
The location of the street.

134
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Where did you get it?

135
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Eight years ago,

136
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
we were at the end of the street in Yingke.

137
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Then you told me to put my phone away.

138
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Change a place to be free.

139
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
We're going to the back of Chaoshan Group.

140
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Chaoshan system.

141
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Does Xianbi have a clue?

142
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I don't know.

143
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I...

144
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I'm a single-cell contact.

145
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I only have one cell phone.

146
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I don't know anything else.

147
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
What about Gu Chali?

148
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Gu Chali is a traitor.

149
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I told you not to let him follow you.

150
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
He said he might be Japanese.

151
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
He's not an actor around you.

152
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I really don't know.

153
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Which play are you playing?

154
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I can sit down and wait for the general.

155
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Come on.

156
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Prepare the food for him.

157
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Yes.

158
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Send me the food.

159
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Yes.

160
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I'm sorry.

161
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
How did the general know he was Japanese?

162
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:11,000
He killed the leader's son to get the secret code of the Japanese committee.

163
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
That's even more ridiculous.

164
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:21,000
You all know that I never participated in the committee.

165
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,000
How could I know who has the code?

166
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Little Firey,

167
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,000
you need skills to make up a story.

168
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Chief Li,

169
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
we have to be more careful.

170
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
How did you know the code was in Qiao Ben's hand?

171
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I can't ask you.

172
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
But Qiao Ben you told me to kill is the son of Chief Chu.

173
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
He'd rather kill a thousand people than let one go.

174
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Let's just give up.

175
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
We have our own way of life.

176
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Okay?

177
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Qiao Ben,

178
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
the general has another son.

179
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Coming.

180
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Coming.

181
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I'm so sleepy.

182
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
He...

183
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Mr. Wu, what's up?

184
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Is Mr. Liang here? I need to talk to him.

185
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
He's been working all night and just came back.

186
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
What's the emergency? I can help you.

187
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I can't.

188
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I have to talk to him in person.

189
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
What's going on?

190
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Come up, Deputy Sergeant.

191
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Are you sure Ding Yi was taken to Yu Yingge?

192
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Yes, I saw it with my own eyes.

193
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
It seems that the death of Chief Chu's son

194
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
is all on us.

195
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I wanted to throw the thunder out,

196
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
but I didn't expect to light the fire.

197
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
My friends,

198
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I am happy to invite

199
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
from the White House,

200
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
the President of the Japanese government

201
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
of the Pan American Union,

202
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
the Canadian Minister of Defense,

203
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Mr. Liang.

204
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Mr. Liang.

205
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Mr. Liang.

206
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I'm so sorry.

207
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I've disturbed you.

208
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Take a seat.

209
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Our teacher, our teacher...

210
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
If I remember correctly,

211
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
the radio station was listed

212
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
as the top list by the Ministry of Public Broadcasting.

213
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
It's not appropriate

214
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
to listen to him so loudly.

215
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I take you as a friend.

216
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I believe in you.

217
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Mr. Liang,

218
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I don't think so.

219
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
You've been in touch with Chongqing for so long.

220
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Why didn't you tell your brother?

221
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I'm sorry.

222
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Miss Nau Hui.

223
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Can I talk to you?

224
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Is your leg better?

225
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
It seems that we've known each other for a long time.

226
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
It's good that

227
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
we don't have to introduce ourselves.

228
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I'm sorry.

229
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
It's good that

230
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
we don't have to introduce ourselves.

231
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Miss Nau Hui,

232
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I want to ask you to save Zhou Zi.

233
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Since the anti-Japanese war,

234
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
the Tang family in Chongqing

235
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
has grown three hundred times

236
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
than before the anti-Japanese war.

237
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
But a few months ago,

238
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
the Tang Mi Tongkou Committee in Chongqing

239
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
received a batch of donations

240
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
and a batch of imported sugar machines.

241
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Really?

242
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Of course.

243
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
It solved the technical problems

244
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
of all the Tang factories near the Sichuan cabinet.

245
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
But according to the internal news,

246
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
the donor is from Shunde, Guangdong.

247
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
His surname is Ye.

248
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
If the customer remembers correctly,

249
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
is the family of Ye from Shunde, Guangdong

250
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
in your sister-in-law's family?

251
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
That's right.

252
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
But there are many people from Shunde's family.

253
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Do you suspect your sister-in-law?

254
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Brother Liang, you still don't treat me as a brother.

255
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I'm not telling the truth.

256
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Then why would the people from the economy department

257
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
and the committee of finance

258
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
go to sleep in private

259
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
for you to return to Chongqing?

260
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Oh,

261
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I also know one more thing.

262
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Only the military police

263
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
will not let you go until you die.

264
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Because you blew up

265
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
the contact point of Shanghai Station.

266
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I am now a member of the Green House Committee.

267
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Don't mention the past.

268
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
But Brother Liang,

269
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
you have to think about your sister-in-law's family.

270
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
How much did the Ye family spend

271
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
on your position as a member?

272
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
That's a lot of money.

273
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
If you still want to climb up,

274
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
can the Ye family still afford it?

275
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I'm not talking about this.

276
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
But Chongqing's family is very rich.

277
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I'm not talking about this.

278
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
But Chongqing's family is different.

279
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
The front line is in a deadlock.

280
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
The rear end is in a deadlock.

281
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
The Ye family can donate some machines at will.

282
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
That's a lot of money for the rear end.

283
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Some people are forced to accept your love.

284
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Brother Liang,

285
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
for you,

286
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I am the one who is the best.

287
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Brother Liang said

288
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
the war is coming to an end.

289
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
What kind of hero can we be in the past?

290
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Brother Liang,

291
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
you'd better understand.

292
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
America.

293
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
America is ready to fight.

294
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Seven million for implementation.

295
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
This law will in fact design it to...

296
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Brother Liang, you've heard it.

297
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
The rest of the country has entered an emergency.

298
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
You've worked in the US,

299
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
you've opened the eyes,

300
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
so you know the strength of the US.

301
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
But from an energy perspective,

302
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
80% of Japan's oil is imported from the US.

303
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Once the US takes part in the war,

304
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
the next war will be unimaginable.

305
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
At that time, the Wang government

306
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
can't even guarantee local power.

307
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Who will be invited to a small meeting of the House of Representatives?

308
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Who will be invited to a small meeting of the House of Representatives?

309
00:17:40,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Even if they'reley,

310
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
It's the second time.

311
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Zuo Zuo, the young general,

312
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
didn't come for Li Yue Se,

313
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
but for the whole Dongyuan Temple family.

314
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Miss Nai Hui,

315
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
you can't let him continue.

316
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
You are making a fuss in Shanghai

317
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
with the name of the four sons of Dongyuan Temple.

318
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I haven't had time to settle the score with you.

319
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
How dare you

320
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
come to me to save a liar?

321
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Why did he take the name of the four sons of Dongyuan Temple?

322
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Joseph will explain to you.

323
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
But he is definitely not a liar.

324
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
He is doing his best

325
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
to protect the interests of the four Dongyuan Temple.

326
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Without him,

327
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
the new government

328
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
and the Xin'an Courtyard

329
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
would have lost the place of the four Dongyuan Temple.

330
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Ridiculous!

331
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
The four Dongyuan Temple families

332
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
have always been under the control of the Heavenly Emperor.

333
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
We are still in the position

334
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
of being protected by an outsider.

335
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
The Prime Minister is seriously ill and bedridden.

336
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Miss Nai Hui is not involved in politics.

337
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I'm afraid she doesn't understand the current situation.

338
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Now the Eastern Barrier Sect

339
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
is preparing to declare war on the British and American forces.

340
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
The military is investigating

341
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
the collusion with the British and American forces.

342
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
The four Dongyuan Temple families are the first to be involved.

343
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
If Joseph didn't put pressure on the four Dongyuan Temple families,

344
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
the military forces of the present Daguang

345
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
would have been moved to the headquarters of the county military headquarters.

346
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Mrs. Li,

347
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
are you provoking

348
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
the unity of our Imperial Army?

349
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Whether it is or not,

350
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
you will know when you see the interrogation record of that day.

351
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I understand.

352
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
You are here to relieve my brother's worries.

353
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Brother Liang,

354
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
it's not just a worry.

355
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Brother, I'm still thinking about this for you.

356
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
The people of the Dongyuan Temple family have arrived.

357
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
So the big water behind Li Yue Se

358
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
has been re-established.

359
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Even if you climb to the position of the chairman of the committee,

360
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
do you think you can personally

361
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
break a leg of Li Yue Se?

362
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
No.

363
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
You can't.

364
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Only if you destroy Chongqing

365
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
can you take the name of the anti-person re-establishment

366
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
and take revenge on Li Yue Se

367
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
with your own hands.

368
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Speaking of which,

369
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
the assassination of Mr. Zuo

370
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
was really done by you.

371
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Brother Liang,

372
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
it's not our people.

373
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
It's our people.

374
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
You saved people for me.

375
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I

376
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
will call the military

377
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
and the police office

378
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
for you.

379
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I knew it.

380
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I said before...

381
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I said before

382
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
when I reported to Chongqing,

383
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
how come I couldn't get a reply?

384
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
The problem was here.

385
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I was wrong.

386
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I was wrong.

387
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Brother Liang,

388
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
the garden in the house

389
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
can't be swayed anymore.

390
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
There's no time.

391
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Charlie,

392
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Charlie,

393
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Charlie,

394
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Charlie,

395
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Charlie.

396
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Do you know

397
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
that the first time I saw Charlie

398
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
was on the street

399
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
and he was

400
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
on the street

401
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
with a girl

402
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
who looked like him.

403
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
When I saw you,

404
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
I was very interested in you.

405
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
I didn't expect

406
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
that you were so experienced

407
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
in Chongqing.

408
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
The Ministry of Economy,

409
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
the Committee of Finance,

410
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
and the Military and Land Administration

411
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
all got the first-hand information.

412
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
So I want to ask

413
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
who is the big tree behind you?

414
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
What does it have to do with it?

415
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
It does.

416
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
We work together.

417
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
We have a lot of work to do.

418
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
The important thing is that we cooperate.

419
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
No. 154, South Yanglu.

420
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Gu's Mansion.

421
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Gu's Mansion.

422
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Liang, I still have that saying

423
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
that a wise man will always find the right man.

424
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
I'll take a smoke

425
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
and have a drink.

426
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Happy cooperation.

427
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Happy cooperation.

428
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
I understand, Mr. Nagai.

429
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
But the interrogation records

430
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
are confidential documents,

431
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
so the external room is not clear.

432
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
You are Chinese,

433
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
so you can't be the big tree behind me.

434
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
I don't care what you Chinese people do

435
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
in the Li Youxiang case.

436
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
What I want to know is

437
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
what you are going to do

438
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
in the Dongyuan case.

439
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
If there is a problem

440
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
that you really want to know,

441
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
why don't you ask me?

442
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Ask Li Youxiang,

443
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
who has nothing to do with the money.

444
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
What are you going to do?

445
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Mr. Megumi,

446
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
I'm sorry.

447
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
What I asked Li Youxiang

448
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
was because

449
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
we had a report

450
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
about the Dongyuan case.

451
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
But the content was not true,

452
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
so I didn't ask.

453
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
But...

454
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
If there is such a news,

455
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
why don't you ask us?

456
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
You are a close friend of the Emperor,

457
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
so if the Emperor wakes up,

458
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000
and finds out about your health today,

459
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
he will be disappointed.

460
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
I have a report

461
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
that you are the only one

462
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
who is in charge

463
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
of the secret design business

464
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
of the new government.

465
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Is it the order of the Dongyuan case?

466
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
During the reign of the Emperor,

467
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
your father and classmates

468
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
were frequently involved in the Dongyuan case.

469
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
What kind of British

470
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,000
did you meet in the Emperor's family?

471
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Mr. Li,

472
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
I think you know,

473
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
but all the statements

474
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
are recorded here.

475
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
The case is closed for the time being.

476
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
According to the Japanese war law,

477
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
it is a death penalty.

478
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Don't worry.

479
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
I can take responsibility

480
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
for every word I say.

481
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
And I am willing to use

482
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
my own life

483
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
to guarantee the military,

484
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
the loyalty of the Dongyuan family

485
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
to the Great Japanese Empire.

486
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
You can doubt me,

487
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
but you should never doubt the Great Emperor.

488
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
The loyal general is loyal.

489
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
So Joseph can still survive.

490
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
But Miss Nauhui,

491
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
the one who is interrogating him today is Zuo Zoumu.

492
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
I said that if he said something wrong,

493
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Zuo Zoumu will give the Dongyuan family

494
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
a title of a leader and a traitor.

495
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Then,

496
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
it will be too late.

497
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Where did Yu Yueze go?

498
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Yu Yingge.

499
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
You said I told you to kill him?

500
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
You...

501
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Stop pretending.

502
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Just now,

503
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
a whole row of corpses were laid

504
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
under your feet.

505
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
They were all killed by Nauhui and Zuo Zoumu.

506
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Stop defending the organization.

507
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Stop involving the innocent.

508
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Perhaps the next person lying under your feet

509
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
is your wife.

510
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Come back!

511
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Come back!

512
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Lohan!

513
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Don't be ridiculous.

514
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Your name is Lohan.

515
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,000
You graduated from Pujian University's Mathematics Department.

516
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
You followed your senior, Maoren Fong,

517
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,000
and entered the Wampu Army.

518
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
After graduation,

519
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
you became a transfer student.

520
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
In the 29th year of the Republic,

521
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:53,000
you were entrusted with a very important mission

522
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,000
and were sent to Shanghai from the Juche.

523
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Isn't that right?

524
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Your senior

525
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
values you very much.

526
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,000
He gave you a good condition to save you,

527
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
but I refused.

528
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,000
But he gave me a condition too.

529
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
You are?

530
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
You are just a worthless person.

531
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
However,

532
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
your partner is different.

533
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,000
He has been in the new government for a long time,

534
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,000
and has been able to understand our information.

535
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Moreover, he is directly connected

536
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:45,000
with the top secret military secret service of the Juche.

537
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,000
He is quite a high rank.

538
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
I want to know his name.

539
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
If you tell me his name,

540
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
I will save your life.

541
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,000
What did he say?

542
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
He said

543
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,000
even if you kill him a thousand times,

544
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:17,000
his name will never be revealed.

545
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Mr. Lao, you are so cruel.

546
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
You are here

547
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
to fight for the people with your life,

548
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
and to protect your friends.

549
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
But your country

550
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
abandoned you like a piece of trash

551
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,000
to protect itself.

552
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
In your country,

553
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,000
the weight of human life is different.

554
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Ha ha ha ha ha

555
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
I'm getting more and more interested.

556
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Mao Lian Hong,

557
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
who is the one who gives up on you

558
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
and tries to protect you,

559
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
who are you?

560
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Mao Lian Hong,

561
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,000
I don't want to negotiate with you,

562
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
but you should negotiate with me.

563
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
If you tell me his name,

564
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
I will release you.

565
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
You are so cruel.

566
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Okay.

567
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Boss, go ahead.

568
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
You know how difficult it is

569
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
to get rid of the sword, blood, and beans from Caoer Village.

570
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
If today's operation fails,

571
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,000
can you take responsibility?

572
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Go.

573
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Go.

574
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Go.

575
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Yes.

576
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
You are a hero.

577
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
You must have achieved great achievements.

578
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
But fate

579
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,000
didn't give you that chance.

580
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,000
I will give you

581
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
a chance to live.

582
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
For the sake of the sword

583
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
that let you go,

584
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,000
can you really give up your life?

585
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Is that really okay?

586
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
I...

587
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
I am...

588
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Yuan... Yuan Se.

589
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Young Master,

590
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
this man

591
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
has gone mad.

592
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Mr. Li,

593
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,000
he is trying to kill you.

594
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Mr. Li,

595
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
with your own hands,

596
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
kill him.

597
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Kill him.

598
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
I want to, too.

599
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
But I can't see anything

600
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
because I am acting.

601
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
If I kill him,

602
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
I will lose the clue

603
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:25,000
and ruin the plan.

604
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Don't worry about that.

605
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
He is a lucky man.

606
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
After killing many of our men,

607
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
he tried to kill himself,

608
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
but the last bullet was in vain.

609
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
You can't see it,

610
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
so it may not hit him.

611
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
I don't know

612
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
if you are lucky.

613
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
I want to test you.

614
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Yuan Se.

615
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Yuan Se.

616
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Zhang Jiang,

617
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
what's wrong?

618
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Did I kill him?

619
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,000
I could have killed him earlier.

620
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
I could have killed him a little later.

621
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
I can't see anything.

622
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
I can't see anything.

623
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
He is in a coma.

624
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
I can't find anything.

625
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Follow me.

626
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Now,

627
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
it's Mr. Li's turn.

628
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
You and...

629
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Mr. Li.

630
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Mr. Sasaki.

631
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Joseph.

632
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Joseph.

633
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Mr. Li.

634
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Mr. Li.

635
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
I'm glad you are okay.

636
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Send Mr. Li away.

637
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Yes.

638
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
See you.

639
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
He is suspected of killing

640
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:57,000
the Japanese colonel and our commander.

641
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
We can't release him.

642
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Megumi.

643
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Don't talk to me.

644
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
My business

645
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
can't involve the Eastern Yuan clan.

646
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
You are just a little.

647
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Do you think you can question

648
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,000
the Eastern Yuan clan?

649
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Are you

650
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
defending him?

651
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,000
That's an act to turn the military into an enemy.

652
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Lin Xiaojie.

653
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Can you really represent the Eastern Yuan clan?

654
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:51,000
I can represent the Eastern Yuan clan.

655
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,000
But can you represent the military?

656
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
You are just a dog

657
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
that wags its tail at the head of the Eastern court.

658
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Don't look too high.

659
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Take him away.

660
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Yes.

661
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Wait.

662
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Wait.

663
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Shoushou.

664
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Shoushou.

665
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Shoushou.

666
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Shoushou.

667
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,000
The funeral of the sea wolf is ready.

668
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Do you want to go there?

669
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,000
You are the one who killed the Japanese colonel.

670
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:55,000
You are the one who killed the Japanese colonel.

671
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:59,000
You are the one who killed the Japanese colonel.

672
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,000
I won't forget what you said.

673
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
The Eastern Yuan clan will meet

674
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,000
with this sword today.

675
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Go.

676
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Go.

677
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,000
All the people on that boat are arrested.

678
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
After the funeral,

679
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,000
they will be interrogated one by one in front of the other's room.

680
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Yes.

681
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Go.

682
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,000
The Eastern Yuan clan will meet with this sword today.

683
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,000
After the funeral, they will be interrogated one by one in front of the other's room.

684
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Yes.

685
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Go.

686
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Go.

687
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Go.

688
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Go.

689
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Go.

690
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Go.

691
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Go.

692
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Go.

693
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Go.

694
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Go.

695
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Go.

696
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Go.

697
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Go.

698
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Go.

699
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Go.

700
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Go.

701
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Go.

702
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Go.

703
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Go.

704
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Go.

705
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Go.

706
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Go.

707
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Go.

708
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Go.

709
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Okay.

710
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Sorry.

711
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Maybe you have a bad intention.

712
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Which is why you hardened with the lockedjae economic concession slide on maintained by katamon get in

713
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
the next three years,

714
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
or before be flogged.

715
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
You'll not lose the chance.

716
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
You...

717
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
You...

718
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
You...

719
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Don't think too much.

720
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
They're notatan쿥č Chang but they are,

721
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
but they are also are patriclan.

722
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
But they are patriclan,

723
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
so they won't have a chance.

724
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Don't boast.

725
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
That's what people think of us.

726
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Mm-mm.

727
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Young Master,

728
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
I'll help you to do this.

729
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
I'm begging you in Japan.

730
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Take him away.

731
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Tomorrow morning,

732
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,000
I'll arrange for you and Lu Han to leave together.

733
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Okay.

734
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Mm-mm.

735
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Mm-mm.

736
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Mm-mm.

737
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
He is watching

738
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,000
the vast night

739
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Tears are pouring down

740
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,000
a wound that is torn apart

741
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,000
He is watching

742
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,000
the shadow wandering

743
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
The night falls

744
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:25,000
and the dawn is already coming

745
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
The night falls

746
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:33,000
and the dawn is already coming
