Episode 16

4
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,520
Can you be responsible for your decision?

5
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,520
I can be responsible for my decision.

6
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,520
But you,

7
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
can you be responsible for your suspicion?

8
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Let's go.

9
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Chief Chen,

10
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
there's an emergency.

11
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
This place has been locked.

12
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Chief Liang, come here.

13
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Chief Liang.

14
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Sorry to keep you waiting.

15
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Today, thanks to the help of three experts,

16
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
we successfully avoided a disaster.

17
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
According to our analysis,

18
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
we found a bomb in Xinya Hotel.

19
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
We successfully prevented the action of military terrorists.

20
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
The three experts have done a great job.

21
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I will definitely apply for a bonus for the three experts.

22
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Of course, you will be the leader.

23
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Shanghai Station

24
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I have reported the situation in Shanghai Station to Secretary Mao.

25
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
But this Cao Yuanzhong and the chairman's wife are quite distant.

26
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Boss Tai can't touch her.

27
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
But my brother said that

28
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
our actions in the future should be completely independent from Shanghai Station.

29
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
As long as there are actions that expose risks,

30
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
you should not participate.

31
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Everything is at risk.

32
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I don't care if he wants me to.

33
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Why did Xian Biyun follow her?

34
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,620
To save her life, she was dragged into the water by the

35
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:46,000
group of people in the group.

36
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
The students in the country are making a scene.

37
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
She couldn't shoot the film, so she went in with Ding Yi.

38
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Is she really just an actress?

39
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Did you find anything?

40
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
She is a public figure.

41
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Since she was 16, her experience every year has been clear.

42
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
She can't see the problem, but I still can't rest assured.

43
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
She knows too much.

44
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
If there is a problem,

45
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
we will report it in advance.

46
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
You, me, and maybe even your Gu family

47
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
can't escape from it.

48
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
It's okay. I trust her.

49
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
What?

50
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
What is the situation with Li Boyao?

51
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I've checked it thoroughly.

52
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Li Boyao is not only outside the police station,

53
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
but also in Shanghai's special police station.

54
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
She is also paying the salary of the military, the central, the Qing and the Red Gang.

55
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
That's why she is very generous.

56
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Hello.

57
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Good afternoon.

58
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
You've figured it out?

59
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
So you've figured it out?

60
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
What?

61
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
There are so many positions.

62
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I must know a lot of things.

63
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
The more I know, the more I can't keep this person.

64
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I'm sorry.

65
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I'm sorry.

66
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I'm sorry.

67
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I'm sorry.

68
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I'm sorry.

69
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I'm sorry.

70
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I'm sorry.

71
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Go to hell.

72
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Li Ni Boyao has been arrested.

73
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I request to investigate

74
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
the background of the former leader of Chaosheng Group,

75
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Xian Biyun.

76
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
We'll go to Mi Lanying's place in a few minutes.

77
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
That's the most important intelligence agency in Wangwei.

78
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
The people inside are all information agencies

79
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
that Zuo Zoumu and Liang Jinghan personally selected.

80
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
You can't play like before.

81
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Otherwise, what's waiting for us is to be in the top ten.

82
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I still understand this kind of relationship.

83
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Don't worry.

84
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I'm ready.

85
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I'm ready.

86
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
You're just right.

87
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
You're just right.

88
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
They are all the destroyers of the Breakthrough Club.

89
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
And some of them are the Jiaming members of the Jiaming Club.

90
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
But the one they admire the most is still you.

91
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Yes.

92
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
The password of the Breakthrough Club is already the legend of the password world.

93
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I heard that you were so excited to come.

94
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Yes.

95
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Let me introduce you.

96
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Director Shen, Director Yi, and Director Ye

97
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
are both on the first floor.

98
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
The one on the second floor is on the first floor.

99
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Let's go.

100
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Please.

101
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Please.

102
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Secretary Jiang,

103
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
why are Director Shen and Director Yi not here?

104
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Director Shen and Director Yi

105
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
are here to discuss about the password.

106
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
The secret code of the West Pavilion?

107
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Why doesn't Director Li know about this?

108
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Director Liang said that

109
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Director Li should not interfere with the design of the password.

110
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
He shouldn't be involved in this.

111
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Please.

112
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Director Li.

113
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Director Li.

114
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Director Li.

115
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Director Li.

116
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Please.

117
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
This is Director Liang's office.

118
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Because you are the director,

119
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
the office is on the second floor.

120
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
The rest of you are on the first floor.

121
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
In order to not interfere with Director Li's work,

122
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
we have set up your office in the very bottom.

123
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Hello, Director Li.

124
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I am Director Ye's assistant, Yi Aida.

125
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Director Li,

126
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
your office.

127
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
This is your office.

128
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
If you have any questions,

129
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
please feel free to ask.

130
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Thank you, Secretary Jiang.

131
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Stop looking for it.

132
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
How do you know it's not here?

133
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
The information of the Bureau is very important.

134
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
All the documents are here.

135
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
If you have a pair of ears, you will be in danger.

136
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
If you have two ears,

137
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
you won't be in the office of the Bureau.

138
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
You are right.

139
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
It's really good.

140
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
It's very rich.

141
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Yes, yes, yes.

142
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
It's really good.

143
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Thank you.

144
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Look at this big eye.

145
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
It's so beautiful.

146
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
It's so beautiful.

147
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Thank you very much.

148
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I don't want to cheat.

149
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
You are so beautiful.

150
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I don't want to cheat.

151
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Don't be modest.

152
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
You are good at everything.

153
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
You are good at cooking.

154
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
You are good at everything.

155
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
If I were a man,

156
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I would have married him long ago.

157
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I wouldn't have to do this.

158
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Right?

159
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Who says not?

160
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Tell me,

161
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
how can a star like you

162
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
do so many things at home?

163
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
No.

164
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
If a man

165
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
eats dumplings made by the director

166
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
and the vice director's wife,

167
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
he will break the code.

168
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
He is right.

169
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I am an actress.

170
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I need to know more.

171
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I can't do this.

172
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Today,

173
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I have made a lot of dishes.

174
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I made some pork

175
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
and pork chicken dishes.

176
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I don't know

177
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
what you like.

178
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Don't mind it.

179
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
It's okay.

180
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
The steamed dumplings

181
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
are ready.

182
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Mrs. Yu,

183
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I told Dong

184
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
that she is a native of Northeast China.

185
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Next time,

186
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I will treat you to a authentic

187
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
sour and spicy dumpling.

188
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
It's so delicious.

189
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Shandong people love dumplings.

190
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
The interview

191
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
will be held in Henan.

192
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Okay.

193
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
What about Mrs. Liu?

194
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Me?

195
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I like beef and

196
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
lamb.

197
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
You are from the south.

198
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Why do you like the north?

199
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I don't know.

200
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Mr. Liu

201
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
moved to Northeast China.

202
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
We lived in the same place for 8 years.

203
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
We are used to it.

204
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Mrs. Wang

205
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
is a friend of mine.

206
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
We are used to it.

207
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Right, Mrs. Wang?

208
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Yes.

209
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Give me your hand.

210
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
What's wrong?

211
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Why are you so sad?

212
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
We are on the second floor.

213
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
We are sitting on the same floor

214
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
as Liang Jingyuan.

215
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
We are all under his feet.

216
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
It's great.

217
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
In this password research center,

218
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Shen Wanqing is responsible for the encryption.

219
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
This means

220
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
he will receive

221
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
countless intelligence from the special forces.

222
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Yi Xiuyuan is responsible for the decoding.

223
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
This also means

224
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
he will know which information

225
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
the special forces have.

226
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Only we,

227
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Liang Jingyuan, put you in a very obvious position

228
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
and became a deputy director.

229
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
But we are only responsible for the design of the password

230
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
and the training.

231
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
But I think

232
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
it's good

233
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
not to get

234
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
into the core intelligence.

235
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Think about it.

236
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I don't understand anything.

237
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
If I get too much information,

238
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I will be confused.

239
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
It's easy to expose.

240
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
But the purpose of our visit

241
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
is to get into the core intelligence.

242
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
And that Jiang just mentioned

243
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
the meeting they are holding

244
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
about decoding the CIC code.

245
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
The CIC code is very important to us.

246
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
It's the most solid

247
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
treasure in our battlefield.

248
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
The CIC code is the only thing

249
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
that can keep the Third Area.

250
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
It's the lives of

251
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
hundreds of thousands of soldiers

252
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
in the five groups of the Third Area.

253
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
So it can't be broken by the Japanese.

254
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
What we need to know now

255
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
is how much the CIC code

256
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
is decoded by them.

257
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Don't worry. I will take care of it.

258
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I am the vice director now.

259
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I will help you.

260
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
It's too dangerous for you.

261
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
They didn't ask you to the meeting.

262
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
It means Liang Jinyuan

263
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
doesn't trust you at all.

264
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
If you go to the meeting without permission,

265
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
it will only make him suspicious.

266
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I will decode the CIC code

267
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
myself.

268
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I will figure it out.

269
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Thank you.

270
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
You are welcome.

271
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
What should I do?

272
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Black Star Academy.

273
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Although they are students,

274
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
they are also experts in decoding.

275
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
In case they ask you a question

276
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
that you can't answer,

277
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
how about this?

278
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I will move all the things

279
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
about the CIC code here tomorrow.

280
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
You can do it there.

281
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Again?

282
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Using the emergency decoding plan

283
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
today is an important action plan.

284
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Look at this.

285
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Aunt, you asked us to decode it

286
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
and then we will decode it.

287
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
She used the contact information

288
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
that Black Star Academy gave to the organization

289
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
to inform us that we will meet

290
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
at the CIC

291
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
at 3 o'clock tomorrow

292
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
at the CIC exchange.

293
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
The situation is still uncertain.

294
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
The organization believes

295
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
that among the comrades

296
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
who can freely move

297
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
their identities to the CIC

298
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
is the most suitable.

299
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
But...

300
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
But...

301
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
The organization is worried

302
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
that the enemy will also know

303
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
about this emergency decoding plan.

304
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
So,

305
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
the person who will be decoding it

306
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
with you tomorrow is probably

307
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Zhen Baiye.

308
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Of course,

309
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
it is also possible that the enemy

310
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
will know about it.

311
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
The Communist Party

312
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:56,160
is writing a telegram in the

313
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,160
flagpole and conveying codes

314
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,160
while communicating with the novel.

315
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,160
Moreover, this is also a very interesting plan.

316
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
The Chinese knight Wu Qingyuan

317
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
has also planned to

318
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
decode the Japanese.

319
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I will let you know

320
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
if the codes are accurate.

321
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Through my previous contact,

322
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I have already

323
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
locked a large area.

324
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
According to what we know,

325
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Baiye has joined the Man Tie

326
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
24 years ago.

327
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Baiye is currently

328
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
most likely to be

329
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Dong Jinbo,

330
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Liu Gangbai,

331
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Wang Zoukai, Shen Wenqing,

332
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
and the four of them.

333
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
So, tomorrow,

334
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
it will be decided who will appear

335
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
at the securities exchange.

336
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Even if it is not decided,

337
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I will probably know the following direction.

338
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Even if you are

339
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
the one who will be decoding this,

340
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
if you are also humble,

341
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
you may be able to get something.

342
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Thank you for giving me this chance.

343
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Don't worry.

344
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Tomorrow afternoon, I will personally lead the team

345
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
to Yongchang securities

346
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
to open this jade orchid flower for you.

347
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
You must be very careful.

348
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Don't worry.

349
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I won't see anyone tomorrow.

350
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I won't let out the jade orchid.

351
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Thank you.

352
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Hello, Director Liang.

353
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:05,720
Hello, Chief Liang.

354
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,680
Hello, Chief Liang.

355
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,480
Hello.

356
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:19,920
You're back.

357
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:21,400
Close the door.

358
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,480
What's up?

359
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:34,600
Liang.

360
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:35,960
What are you doing?

361
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,760
Are you crazy?

362
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,760
Liang.

363
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,960
Jun Zilan has been raising him for three years.

364
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,440
He's about to bloom.

365
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,320
Is it pretty?

366
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,200
What is this?

367
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:58,840
You'll raise him.

368
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,400
Don't you like Jun Zilan the most?

369
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,520
It doesn't matter what I like.

370
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,280
Who sent you this?

371
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,840
You did?

372
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,800
Then you don't have to throw him away.

373
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,360
You can raise him together.

374
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,200
Come on.

375
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,200
Come on.

376
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,880
Do you remember when we were in England,

377
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:36,120
I was bored and I turned over twenty-four pages.

378
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,480
I saw two words in the dictionary.

379
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,600
Do you remember what it was?

380
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,040
Be a official.

381
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,000
That's right.

382
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,440
Be an official.

383
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,640
Whoever gives you the official title,

384
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,200
you give it to them.

385
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,200
If you want to be a member of the Yue Long Sect,

386
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,680
you have to be loyal.

387
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,120
Do you know what is absolute loyalty?

388
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,960
It's like there's only one thing

389
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,240
on an office desk.

390
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,960
That's the word the officer likes the most.

391
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,200
Why isn't Miss Xian here yet?

392
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,040
I want to go swimming after shooting the gun.

393
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,000
It's rare to see you.

394
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,160
Don't be too anxious.

395
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:30,960
Sorry to keep you waiting.

396
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,400
What's that delicious food?

397
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,000
Dumplings.

398
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,200
Dumplings?

399
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,760
You two didn't eat anything hot today.

400
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,400
I left them for you

401
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,840
because I don't know what you like.

402
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,160
What do we have?

403
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,400
This is pork with cabbage.

404
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:46,960
This is pork with leek.

405
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,160
Leek?

406
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,680
I haven't eaten it yet.

407
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,160
You have to use chopsticks.

408
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:51,680
I'll get it.

409
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,160
Come on.

410
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,080
Don't eat it.

411
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:53,920
I'm going to work.

412
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,080
I have to come back in two days.

413
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:56,880
Come on.

414
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,480
I'm coming.

415
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:02,040
You're so nice.

416
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,040
You're free.

417
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:03,920
Unlike me,

418
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,440
I'm so busy right now.

419
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,320
My mom is worried

420
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,840
that the financial authority of the institute

421
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:09,760
will be handed over to foreigners.

422
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,080
She wants me to be the head of the head office.

423
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,320
My mom thought it was a idle job.

424
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,840
A lot of things

425
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,560
made me have no time to work.

426
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,840
Don't complain.

427
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,720
The head office is full of fat.

428
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,360
You can work at any time.

429
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,000
You can earn money at any time.

430
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,320
Fat?

431
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,520
Where's the fat?

432
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,240
My mom doesn't have that kind of heart.

433
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,120
The first day I went to work,

434
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:36,080
she wrote four big words

435
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,720
on the back of my desk.

436
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,400
Guess what?

437
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:58,180
A double-hulled

438
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:07,200
double bill?

439
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:07,840
That's fake,

440
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,200
isn't it?

441
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,360
Listen to me.

442
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,640
I'm transparent.

443
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,120
My voice apple

444
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,360
and fake are Diesel.

445
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,120
They look the same as the ones

446
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,640
being produced in Hand ilk.

447
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,160
Stupid!

448
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,640
Look at you,

449
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,480
your face is pale.

450
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,560
I elementalized my prejudices.

451
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:28,680
Mingyu.

452
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,600
Just sit back and enjoy,

453
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,600
You're so good at it.

454
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,600
What do you mean?

455
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,600
In the past,

456
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,600
everyone bought flowers and brought them home.

457
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,600
I bought them with my own money.

458
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,600
You spent your own money?

459
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,600
No, I don't want it.

460
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,600
I'm done.

461
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,600
You're so rude.

462
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,600
Take the money.

463
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,600
It's all Miss Xian's fault.

464
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,600
She's looking for a card and a little boy.

465
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,600
I'll return it tomorrow.

466
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,600
I don't want it.

467
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,600
You don't have any income now.

468
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,600
Who says I don't have any?

469
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,600
Shanghai commercial card.

470
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,600
Today's market.

471
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,600
Miss Xian, you play the stock?

472
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,600
Yiyun, you know how to find stocks.

473
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,600
I have a good stock.

474
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,600
South Yang banana.

475
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,600
I have an insider news.

476
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,600
This week, it will double next week.

477
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,600
Who is interested?

478
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,600
Do you want to ask your master?

479
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,600
These two people.

480
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,600
One foot through the other.

481
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,600
I'm interested.

482
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,600
I'll buy it tomorrow.

483
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,600
I tell you.

484
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,600
I just received the news.

485
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:49,600
Not necessarily accurate.

486
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,600
But this is a short-term line.

487
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,600
You have to be quick.

488
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,600
It's best to go in tomorrow.

489
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,600
I'll buy you a pair of hands first.

490
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,600
Just play.

491
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,600
I can spend your money.

492
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,600
I have a small deposit.

493
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,600
Mrs. Liang, hurry up.

494
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,600
Director Liang will be back soon.

495
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,600
Yes, yes, yes.

496
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,600
Play mahjong.

497
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,600
Play mahjong.

498
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,600
How much do we have to play today?

499
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,600
Yiyun, I'll change your mother's way.

500
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,600
I'll get you the money.

501
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:31,600
Is this Xian Biyun really just a staff member?

502
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,600
Did you find anything?

503
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,600
He is a public figure.

504
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,600
Since he was 16 years old,

505
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,600
his experience every year is clear.

506
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,600
Can't see any problems.

507
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,600
But I still can't rest assured.

508
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,600
He knows too much.

509
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,600
Once there is a problem,

510
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,600
did we report it in advance?

511
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,600
No.

512
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,600
I don't know.

513
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,600
I don't know.

514
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,600
I don't know.

515
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,600
You, me,

516
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,600
maybe even your Gu family,

517
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,600
can't get away from it.

518
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:07,600
It's okay. I believe in him.

519
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:29,600
You're here.

520
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,600
Miss Xian.

521
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,600
She said she had something to do outside.

522
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,600
Did you secretly spray my perfume?

523
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:51,600
Secretly.

524
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,600
You speak so badly.

525
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,600
Do I have to be so unobtrusive?

526
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,600
Besides,

527
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,600
a famous cryptologist, Joseph Lin,

528
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,600
doesn't have to be so unobtrusive.

529
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,600
Okay.

530
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:09,600
Fine.

531
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,600
You still owe me.

532
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,600
Eat your meal.

533
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,600
Eat your meal.

534
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,600
Oh, no.

535
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,600
I wasted it.

536
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,600
This is perfume, not perfume.

537
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,600
You didn't spray it.

538
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,600
I know.

539
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,600
I know. I know.

540
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,600
I won't spray it.

541
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,600
You're so weird.

542
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,600
Eat your meal.

543
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,600
What's the name of this perfume?

544
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:11,600
Goulong.

545
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,600
Goulong.

546
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,600
It's a good name.

547
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,600
I wasted it.

548
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:27,600
I'm sorry.

549
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:57,600
Hello, Director Li.

550
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,600
Secretary Jiang.

551
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,600
Why is there such a big earthquake today?

552
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,600
We have a mission today.

553
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,600
Hello, Director Li.

554
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,600
Hello, everyone.

555
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,600
Director Li.

556
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,600
Good morning.

557
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,600
Hello, Director Li.

558
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,600
Hello, everyone.

559
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,600
Wait for me.

560
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,600
Director Li, let me help you.

561
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,600
I'm sorry, Charlie.

562
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,600
I have something to tell you.

563
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,600
Li Huan.

564
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,600
You're so smart.

565
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:25,600
Here's the thing.

566
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:29,600
Yesterday, I heard Mrs. Li say that she was going to the securities exchange to buy a stock.

567
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,600
She didn't want to say yes when she told me yesterday.

568
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:35,600
So I want to ask you to buy me one.

569
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,600
Southern-Yang banana.

570
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:39,600
No problem.

571
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:41,600
Really?

572
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,600
Thank you.

573
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,600
Don't tell my master.

574
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,600
Remember, it's Southern-Yang banana.

575
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,600
Don't worry.

576
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,600
The perfume smells really good.

577
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,600
Charlie, you can do it.

578
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:53,600
Director Li, I'm leaving.

579
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:56,600
Okay.

580
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:03,600
What did she say to you?

581
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,600
She said it's fun.

582
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,600
Don't ask about kids.

583
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,600
Let's go.

584
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,600
You have to pay attention when you teach them.

585
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:23,600
The essence of Li Yuese's code is the encryption algorithm of one time and one time.

586
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:28,600
The core of it is the code that can generate the code that can generate the code.

587
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,600
And the code that can start the code to generate the code.

588
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,600
So it's not a normal code book.

589
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,600
Do you understand?

590
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:48,600
Yesterday, I heard Mrs. Li say that she was going to the securities exchange to buy a stock.

591
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,600
Southern-Yang banana.

592
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,600
Okay, no problem.

593
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,600
Really?

594
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,600
Really.

595
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,600
Thank you.

596
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,600
Oh, don't tell my master.

597
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:59,600
Remember, it's Southern-Yang banana.

598
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,600
Don't worry.

599
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,600
What are you doing?

600
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:13,600
Let me see.

601
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,600
I'm hungry.

602
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:17,600
I'm hungry.

603
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:19,600
Look at you.

604
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,600
Tea and cigarettes.

605
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,600
I have nothing.

606
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:23,600
And look at this.

607
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:26,600
It's time to have afternoon tea.

608
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:30,600
How about this?

609
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:33,600
Go to the old warehouse and buy me some napao cake.

610
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,600
I want to eat sweet.

611
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,600
I'll be more focused after eating sweet.

612
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,600
So I can memorize more.

613
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,600
I'll go back and memorize these.

614
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:23,600
Thank you.

615
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,600
Excuse me.

616
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,600
Okay.

617
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,600
Look at this.

618
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,600
It would be better if I could find more.

619
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:21,600
Miss Xian.

620
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,600
It's interesting.

621
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:51,600
Miss Xian, you're here.

622
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,600
Southern-Yang banana.

623
00:33:58,600 --> 00:33:59,600
Help me to get it.

624
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,600
Okay.

625
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,600
By the way,

626
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,600
did you order the big house upstairs?

627
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,600
I'm really sorry.

628
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,600
We ordered it this morning.

629
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,600
Do you know who ordered it?

630
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:14,600
Well,

631
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,600
I don't know.

632
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,600
I just know that you ordered it.

633
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,600
I'm sorry.

634
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,600
Go.

635
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,600
Stop.

636
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,600
Don't move.

637
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,600
Don't move.

638
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:27,600
Don't move.

639
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:28,600
Stand back.

640
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,600
Stand back.

641
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,600
Don't move.

642
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:31,600
Don't move.

643
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:32,600
Go over there.

644
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,600
Quick.

645
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,600
What happened?

646
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:53,600
Chief of the Special Forces sent me to search for the Communist Party.

647
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,600
Please cooperate.

648
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:56,600
Don't panic.

649
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,600
You threw the flowers away.

650
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,600
Can you run away?

651
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,600
Help!

652
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,600
Oh, come on!

653
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,600
Chief!

654
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:26,600
Chief!

655
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,600
I'm so sorry for your loss!

656
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,600
Isn't this Mrs. Li?

657
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,600
Mrs. Li, you're here too.

658
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,600
Chief Liang!

659
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,600
Chief Liang!

660
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,600
What brings you here, Mrs. Li?

661
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:41,600
I'm here to buy shares.

662
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,600
You're also here to buy shares?

663
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,600
I just wanted to have some fun.

664
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,600
Isn't this a bit of an insider's story?

665
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:49,600
I even bought two hands for your aunt.

666
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,600
Really?

667
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:53,600
How come I didn't know you were here to buy shares for your aunt?

668
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,600
Mrs. Li,

669
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,600
I was just up there.

670
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,600
I saw someone who looked like you.

671
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,600
He was running around.

672
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,600
He was panicking.

673
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,600
I don't think you're here to buy shares.

674
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,600
Are you here to find someone?

675
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,600
Stop screaming!

676
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,600
Mrs. Li,

677
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,600
you haven't told me yet

678
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:33,600
if you're here to buy shares or to find someone.

679
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,600
I've got your dog.

680
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,600
Who do you suspect is here?

681
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,600
Do you suspect me?

682
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:43,600
Mingyu!

683
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:44,600
Mingyu!

684
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:46,600
Mingyu!

685
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,600
Chief Zhou!

686
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,600
How come there's a dog here?

687
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,600
He didn't bite!

688
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,600
Chief Zhou!

689
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,600
What is this?

690
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:03,600
Chief Zhou!

691
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,600
Is this a dog?

692
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,600
It's okay.

693
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,600
Stop talking.

694
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,600
Chief Li.

695
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,600
Chief Liang.

696
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,600
Thank you.

697
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,600
Why are you here?

698
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:32,600
It's because of Chief Shen's lover, Li Huan.

699
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,600
He ran into me at the lab today.

700
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,600
He lied to me.

701
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:39,600
Yesterday, when I was playing mahjong with Biyun,

702
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:42,600
I heard that Biyun was coming here today to buy shares.

703
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,600
He was in love with many people at the time.

704
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,600
He was too shy to ask.

705
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:50,600
So today, I asked Biyun to tell me

706
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,600
and buy him a song.

707
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,600
I think everyone is in good relationship.

708
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:58,600
This little girl is a good person.

709
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,600
So I came.

710
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,600
Right.

711
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:04,600
Right.

712
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:07,600
Chief Liang also came to buy shares?

713
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,600
Yes.

714
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,600
I told you to wait in the lounge.

715
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:18,600
I've been in the lounge for a long time.

716
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:19,600
You didn't come back.

717
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,600
I was worried that something would happen to you.

718
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,600
I was looking for you everywhere.

719
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,600
And I was misunderstood by Chief Liang.

720
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:28,600
He said I was running around in panic.

721
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:32,600
Did you bring any illegal goods to me?

722
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:41,600
Don't run around when you have bad eyes.

723
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,600
Look at Mrs. Li. She's so anxious.

724
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,600
What kind of shares do you want to buy?

725
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:48,600
Blue and red.

726
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,600
Chief Liang is here.

727
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,600
This is the one that Miss Xia asked me to chase.

728
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,600
Are you sure?

729
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:03,600
Yes.

730
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,600
It's all your fault.

731
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:16,600
If it wasn't for you, we would have been home.

732
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:20,600
I'm sorry, Biyun. I was in a hurry.

733
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:23,600
I've got the dog of Chief Liang.

734
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:26,600
Captain Mo is a dog of Renping.

735
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:29,600
He bites and smells everywhere.

736
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:34,600
Chief Liang, I understand that you have a task.

737
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:37,600
But if Biyun was hurt because of this,

738
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:40,600
is it your fault or the dog's?

739
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:41,600
It's a big matter.

740
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:43,600
I'm also carrying out a task.

741
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,600
If this task is not completed,

742
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:48,600
is the responsibility of Chief Li to be responsible

743
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,600
or Mrs. Li to take responsibility?

744
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:54,600
Okay.

745
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,600
I'll help you complete this task today.

746
00:41:58,600 --> 00:41:59,600
Smell it.

747
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,600
Come on. Smell me.

748
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:02,600
Smell it now.

749
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,600
Come on. Smell it.

750
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:05,600
I won't.

751
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:27,600
I'll go.

752
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:39,600
How much longer?

753
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:41,600
I have to go back to the research institute.

754
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,600
I have to work for you.

755
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:49,600
Come on.

756
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:52,600
Send the director of the institute, Mrs. Li, back.

757
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:54,600
Yes. Please.

758
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:56,600
No need.

759
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:59,600
We'll go by ourselves.

760
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:13,600
Everyone,

761
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:16,600
bring them back to me.

762
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:17,600
Yes.

763
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:19,600
Let's go.

764
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:25,600
Let's go.

765
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:58,600
The deep of the sky turns into a maze

766
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:01,600
When the sun rises

767
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:05,600
The first light will dance for me

768
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:08,600
The house is separated from the maze

769
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:12,600
There is no direction and no way out

770
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:15,600
Pain in the eyes

771
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:19,600
The person who is pretending to be serious is not clear

772
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:22,600
Where is the wind going?

773
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:26,600
Who is the lock on the window?

774
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:29,600
The heart is thinking

775
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:33,600
It's either you or me

776
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:36,600
He is watching

777
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:40,600
In the vast night

778
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:43,600
Tears are pouring

779
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:47,600
A bunch of broken wounds

780
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:50,600
He is watching

781
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:54,600
Wandering in the shadow

782
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:57,600
The night falls

783
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:02,600
Looking back at the world

784
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:05,600
The house is separated from the maze

785
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:09,600
There is no direction and no way out

786
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:12,600
Pain in the eyes

787
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:16,600
The person who is pretending to be serious is not clear

788
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:19,600
Where is the wind going?

789
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:22,600
The heart is thinking

790
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:26,600
It's either you or me

791
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:29,600
He is watching

792
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:32,600
The person who is pretending to be serious is not clear

793
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:35,600
Where is the wind going?

794
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:38,600
Who is the lock on the window?

795
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:41,600
The heart is thinking

796
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:44,600
It's either you or me

797
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:47,600
He is watching

798
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:50,600
In the vast night
