00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,860
Jwni

2
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:16,840
Ar Cabinet

3
00:01:46,840 --> 00:02:11,100
ademÃ¡s de many

4
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,100
I can't just break the contract

5
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:15,100
no matter how much you pay, right?

6
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:19,100
Can you be the owner of this theater?

7
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:21,100
Of course! I'm the boss here!

8
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:28,100
May I ask you something?

9
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,100
What size is your troupe?

10
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:32,100
It's not big. About twenty people.

11
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:38,100
In that case, I'll be straight with you.

12
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,100
I'm not a small troupe

13
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,100
that can afford to rent this place.

14
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:46,100
And now the Meixin troupe

15
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:48,100
is a big troupe of fifty or sixty people.

16
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:50,100
They're full of performances.

17
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,100
Well, I'll buy it.

18
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,100
I'm sorry, everyone.

19
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,100
Today's rehearsal is cancelled for now.

20
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:21,100
What's going on?

21
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,100
Why are there so many people

22
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:24,100
who are going to perform tomorrow?

23
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:26,100
What's going on?

24
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:28,100
Look here.

25
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:30,100
What's going on?

26
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:32,100
What's going on?

27
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:34,100
Oh, my God!

28
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,100
The Meixin troupe

29
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,100
is bullying people

30
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:40,100
and they're bullying us!

31
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:42,100
They're bullying us!

32
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:44,100
They're bullying us!

33
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,100
It's the first day of the show!

34
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,100
What's going on?

35
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:50,100
What's going on?

36
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:52,100
Mom, don't panic.

37
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:54,100
They're going to perform

38
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,100
in the Dream of the Tea-Monger.

39
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,100
It's good that we're not hesitating.

40
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:00,100
You stupid!

41
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:02,100
Who cares about the script?

42
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:04,100
The theater is bigger than us.

43
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:06,100
The venue is more luxurious than us.

44
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:08,100
Of course, the audience

45
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,100
is willing to go to their place.

46
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:12,100
You're a coward!

47
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:14,100
You're a stupid!

48
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,100
You bastard!

49
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,100
You're a fool!

50
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,100
You're a fool!

51
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,100
You'll be in trouble later.

52
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,100
Here, here, here.

53
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,100
Get in!

54
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,100
The Meixin troupe finally kicked you out.

55
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,100
No one will play the role for me anymore.

56
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,100
Miss Xian,

57
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,100
we're out of money

58
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:00,100
after the game.

59
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,100
The outside is screaming about the refund.

60
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,100
I don't know if

61
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,100
we can keep the internal and external troubles.

62
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:08,100
Miss Xian,

63
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,100
this is called a game on the attic.

64
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:12,100
It's high.

65
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:26,100
You're here to refund the tickets?

66
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,100
Are there many people who want to refund the tickets?

67
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:30,100
Sir.

68
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,100
Mr. Gu,

69
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,100
you're here to see Miss Xian, right?

70
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:38,100
Yes.

71
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,100
Miss Xian is busy.

72
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,100
What are you doing?

73
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,100
Miss Xian saved my life.

74
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,100
I said

75
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,100
I would repay you.

76
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,100
It's a good thing

77
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,100
that you're here to repay me.

78
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,100
But it's too much

79
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,100
for you.

80
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,100
Miss Xian is right.

81
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:20,100
For the Meixin troupe,

82
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,100
the Meixin troupe

83
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:24,100
is the most famous troupe in the world.

84
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:26,100
It's not a big deal.

85
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,100
Of course,

86
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:30,100
it's up to you

87
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:32,100
whether you want to move or not.

88
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,100
But Gu Mo has already

89
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,100
bought the troupe.

90
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,100
I see.

91
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,100
You want Ding Ying.

92
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:48,100
I told you

93
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:50,100
I wouldn't let her leave with you.

94
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,100
I won't

95
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,100
leave my people

96
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:56,100
with a dangerous person.

97
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,100
I don't want to eat.

98
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,100
I know Miss Xian.

99
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,100
But she used the only

100
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:12,100
yellow card in the troupe

101
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,100
on Gu Mo.

102
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,100
So,

103
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,100
this 10-core yellow card

104
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:20,100
is my thanks to Miss Xian.

105
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,100
What a big hand.

106
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:44,100
The yellow card

107
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,100
is hard to get in the black market.

108
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,100
Mr. Gu,

109
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,100
you are really

110
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,100
a genius.

111
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:56,100
Miss Xian is

112
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,100
a master of the black market.

113
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,100
The low-level person should be rewarded with a permanent right.

114
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,100
I believe this 10-core yellow card

115
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:04,100
is useful

116
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:06,100
for Miss Xian

117
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:08,100
and her friends.

118
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:10,100
It's a good thing.

119
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,100
It's precious.

120
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,100
But I'm the boss of the troupe.

121
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,100
How can I use it?

122
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:20,100
I don't have any friends

123
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,100
who can use it.

124
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:30,100
I just didn't expect

125
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:32,100
that we have such a big

126
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:34,100
amount of money.

127
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:36,100
Miss Xian, you misunderstood me again.

128
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:38,100
The yellow card and the low-level

129
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,100
are just my thanks

130
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:42,100
to you.

131
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,100
Of course,

132
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,100
I want Ding Yi, too.

133
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,100
As long as Miss Xian

134
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:50,100
can give Ding Yi to me,

135
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,100
then Miss Xian

136
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:54,100
and her friends

137
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,100
can ask me for any conditions.

138
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,100
It's a pity

139
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,100
that I'm not the owner of the land.

140
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,100
She's not our master.

141
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:14,100
I can't be her master.

142
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,100
In the end,

143
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:18,100
it's between you and Ding Yi.

144
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,100
You can tell her directly.

145
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,100
Okay.

146
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,100
From today on,

147
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,100
as long as Ding Yi

148
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,100
leaves the door of Miss Xian's troupe,

149
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,100
it will be between

150
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,100
me and her.

151
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,100
Please don't say anything

152
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:40,100
to Miss Xian.

153
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,100
I'm sorry.

154
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,100
Please.

155
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:24,100
Wait.

156
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,100
Is there anything else?

157
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,100
Mr. Hu,

158
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,100
this...

159
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,100
I've sent it.

160
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,100
There's no reason to take it back.

161
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:38,100
Keep it.

162
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,100
Miss Xian.

163
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,100
Miss Xian.

164
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:54,100
Oh, no, Miss Xian.

165
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:56,100
My car just left the city.

166
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,100
Four masked street-dwellers

167
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:00,100
in suits came out.

168
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:02,100
Ding Yi was taken away.

169
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:06,100
Gu Yanshan.

170
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,100
You...

171
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,100
Look at these lights.

172
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:30,100
You're back to your familiar place.

173
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:36,100
Don't come over.

174
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:38,100
Don't come over.

175
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,100
Miss Xian, you're here.

176
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,100
Sit down.

177
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,100
This way, please.

178
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,100
Miss, do you have time?

179
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:18,100
Comrade Xiao,

180
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:20,100
Gu Yanshan took Ding Yi away.

181
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:24,100
If he's in the hands of the Japanese...

182
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:30,100
I'll ask you.

183
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,100
Don't come over.

184
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,100
Turn around.

185
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:38,100
Turn around.

186
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,100
Unwrap the rope.

187
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,100
The other side is the Chaosheng District.

188
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:44,100
The other side is the Chaosheng District.

189
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:48,100
I can't see anything.

190
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,100
This Gu Yanshan

191
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,100
is the deputy commander of the Chongqing Weishu District.

192
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:54,100
Gu Zhengze's son.

193
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:56,100
He just came back from abroad.

194
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,100
He's a military officer in Shanghai.

195
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:02,100
He kidnapped Ding Yi.

196
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:06,100
It's probably to let Ding Yi

197
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:08,100
continue to play the role of Li Yuecun.

198
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,100
It's to let Ding Yi

199
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,100
continue to play the role of Li Yuecun.

200
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:16,100
To decode the secret code

201
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:18,100
of the Japanese

202
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:20,100
who are leading the war in the north of the Sui.

203
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,100
Find the breakthrough.

204
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,100
But for Ding Yi,

205
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:28,100
this action is too dangerous.

206
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,100
I guess you know

207
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,100
what I'm trying to do.

208
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,100
I'll give you one last chance

209
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:36,100
to bargain.

210
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:38,100
Tell me. How much do you want?

211
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:44,100
One?

212
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:46,100
Two?

213
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:54,100
Five little yellow fish.

214
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,100
How about it?

215
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,100
One?

216
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,100
Ding Yi is just an actor.

217
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:02,100
He has no experience

218
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:04,100
in intelligence.

219
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:06,100
He can't let an innocent person

220
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:08,100
get involved in such a dangerous thing.

221
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,100
Gu Yaoshan is too open-minded.

222
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:14,100
I have an idea.

223
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,100
I'll go to Mr. William.

224
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:20,100
How about it?

225
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:24,100
Well,

226
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:26,100
I'll give you another shot.

227
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,100
Ten!

228
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,100
You used to be responsible for intelligence.

229
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:32,100
You did a great job.

230
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,100
Mr. William is going to resign.

231
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:36,100
So,

232
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:38,100
your job is done.

233
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,100
I promised you

234
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:42,100
that I would send you to Yan'an

235
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:44,100
after the job is done.

236
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:48,100
Since the code is so important,

237
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:50,100
I'll keep it.

238
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,100
Well,

239
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,100
I'll report to the organization

240
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,100
about the current situation.

241
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,100
Be patient.

242
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:00,100
Wait for my news.

243
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,100
I'm worried about the military.

244
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:06,100
The people of the north and the south

245
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:08,100
should survive.

246
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,100
No, no, no.

247
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:14,100
I won't do it.

248
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,100
The more money I give, the faster I die.

249
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:18,100
I'm afraid I'll lose my life.

250
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:20,100
I won't do it.

251
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,100
Why did you choose this place?

252
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,100
It seems that he doesn't trust

253
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:26,100
this little girl.

254
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,100
If he gets caught,

255
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:30,100
he won't have a chance to tell us

256
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:32,100
where he is.

257
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,100
You will die.

258
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,100
And many people

259
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,100
don't dare to think about Tian family.

260
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,100
It's useless to talk about details.

261
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:44,100
Even if Director Jiang comes,

262
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,100
I won't do it.

263
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,100
You're a very ambitious young man.

264
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:56,100
Look.

265
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,100
It seems that he's not convinced by you.

266
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:02,100
Teacher,

267
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,100
why are you here?

268
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,100
He?

269
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,100
He's embarrassed.

270
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,100
Teacher!

271
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,100
Let's go upstairs.

272
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:24,100
Leader.

273
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:26,100
Leader, you're finally here.

274
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,100
You have to punish me.

275
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:30,100
He's a criminal.

276
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:32,100
You should let him be.

277
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:34,100
Why are you bothering us?

278
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:36,100
What are you doing?

279
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:38,100
I just saved his life.

280
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,100
I'm grateful to you.

281
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,100
I'll repay you with my life.

282
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:44,100
My life, teacher.

283
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,100
He's good.

284
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:48,100
He's tied me up.

285
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:50,100
He even forced me to die

286
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:52,100
with ten yellow rings.

287
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:54,100
This is revenge.

288
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,100
I'm not that capable.

289
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,100
I...

290
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,100
I was...

291
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,100
I was...

292
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:04,100
I was scared.

293
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:06,100
I didn't mean the Japanese.

294
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:08,100
If I show up in front of the Japanese,

295
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:10,100
what should I do?

296
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:12,100
I wouldn't need anything to do.

297
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:14,100
I wouldn't need a tiger.

298
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,100
I just need two mouths.

299
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:18,100
I would kill them all.

300
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:20,100
That's why

301
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:22,100
I'm useless.

302
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:24,100
I can't do anything.

303
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:26,700
Can you please let me go?

304
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,700
I'm the only one in my family.

305
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,300
My mother is waiting for me in my hometown.

306
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,100
I'll go back to raise her.

307
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,300
Finished?

308
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:55,900
Twenty pieces.

309
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:13,700
Mr.

310
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:15,700
He's an actor.

311
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:17,500
Six hours.

312
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,900
Give me six hours and I'll persuade him.

313
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,100
Six hours?

314
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:26,100
The battlefield is full of wars.

315
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:28,500
How many lives do you want to kill?

316
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,900
You can't even break it in 16 hours.

317
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:34,500
If you can't break it, why don't you let me try?

318
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:40,900
If we can finish the task by finding a little soul on the street,

319
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:44,700
then the party will spend a lot of money to train us,

320
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,100
which is a waste of money.

321
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:48,300
What about now?

322
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,300
Have you broken it?

323
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,300
Is there a way?

324
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:55,900
Okay.

325
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,100
If he can finish the task,

326
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,500
I, Luo Han, will follow your lead.

327
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:01,700
I'll be on guard.

328
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:02,900
I won't complain.

329
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,100
Okay.

330
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,100
I remember what you said.

331
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:17,900
Chief Cao.

332
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,500
Take a deep breath.

333
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,900
Take a deep breath.

334
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,500
The password of the Liyue Club,

335
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:29,900
even if we restore the power station and collect information,

336
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:32,100
you have a few pieces of confidence in a short time.

337
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:33,300
Break it.

338
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,500
I'll do it.

339
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,700
If you can't break it,

340
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:41,100
the battlefield is full of wars.

341
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:44,100
Do you think it will be a problem?

342
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:48,300
That's right.

343
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:51,100
I tell you, you don't know.

344
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,100
The Gu family

345
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:55,300
has been the Wang family in the Hu family.

346
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:58,300
The chairman of the committee had been kind to them.

347
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:02,300
You want him to go to the trouble.

348
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,500
If the task fails,

349
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,300
he will be in charge of us.

350
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:09,100
The chairman won't do anything to Shanghai.

351
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,500
You're a good commander.

352
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:21,100
You're a good commander.

353
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:30,900
You're so young.

354
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:34,500
You'll know when I'm old.

355
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,500
Being a leader is more important than doing something.

356
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,500
You're a good commander.

357
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,300
You'll know when I'm old.

358
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,900
Being a leader is more important than doing something.

359
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:48,300
Being a leader is more important than doing something.

360
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,300
You're a good commander.

361
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,100
You're a good commander.

362
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:53,900
You're a good commander.

363
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,700
You're a good commander.

364
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,500
You're a good commander.

365
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,300
You're a good commander.

366
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,100
You're a good commander.

367
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:02,900
You're a good commander.

368
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,700
You're a good commander.

369
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,700
You're a good commander.

370
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,700
You're a good commander.

371
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:11,300
Mr. Gu, I'm sorry.

372
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,900
This is the end of the show.

373
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:31,100
It's really useless.

374
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:34,300
I'm telling you, it's useless to persuade me.

375
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,500
You've asked me about the set of the N.V.

376
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,300
It's not good for me.

377
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,700
You know,

378
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,700
it's not good for me.

379
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,300
You know,

380
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:46,700
I've been doing this for six days, six months, six years.

381
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:49,700
I've been doing this for six days, six months, six years.

382
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:52,700
I've been doing this for six days, six months, six years.

383
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:55,700
So I think you should waste your time with me.

384
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,900
Send me back.

385
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:00,700
The audience is waiting for me to come on stage.

386
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:05,700
Do you really think you can go back to the stage

387
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:08,100
and be as free and free as before?

388
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,500
I heard you're from the Northeast.

389
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:18,700
You came to Shanghai after the 918 incident.

390
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:24,500
Yes, what's wrong?

391
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:29,100
My mother died in the 918 incident.

392
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,700
That's why she took me out.

393
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:34,900
So if I lost my life here,

394
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,700
I'll be sorry for her.

395
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,900
After the 918 incident,

396
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:42,700
you could escape from the Northeast to Shanghai.

397
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:46,100
But now the Northeast, the North China Sea have fallen.

398
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:48,100
The Chinese have been trapped in the bitter war.

399
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,900
Shanghai has been trapped in the mud.

400
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,300
The concession has become an isolated island.

401
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:56,300
It may not take a few days for the Japanese to enter the concession.

402
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:58,700
Where will you escape to?

403
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,700
Stop, stop, stop.

404
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:02,300
Don't talk to me about this.

405
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:06,100
Do you really think we don't know anything?

406
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,100
Why did we escape the 918?

407
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:11,900
It's because the Northeast gave up the resistance.

408
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:14,500
They used us to defend the country.

409
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:17,100
If it wasn't for our luck,

410
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:19,100
we wouldn't be alive now.

411
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,900
It's the same now.

412
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:25,900
The Japanese came and shot.

413
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,500
Where is Director Jiang?

414
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,900
He ran away.

415
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,300
He went to Chongqing.

416
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,300
What?

417
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:36,100
You want us to shoot him?

418
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,300
I tell you, I can see it.

419
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:41,100
The bigger the official, the faster he runs.

420
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:53,900
You're right.

421
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:58,500
But if everyone thinks so,

422
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:03,100
it's not far from the destruction of the country.

423
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:06,700
Don't be so stingy.

424
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,100
We are the people.

425
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:11,100
It has nothing to do with us.

426
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:19,900
The Eight-Nation Alliance entered Beijing.

427
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,500
The 18,000-men coalition

428
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:27,700
took over the capital of the tens of thousands of soldiers.

429
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:30,100
The authorities,

430
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,300
besides being weak,

431
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:35,700
opened the gate for them.

432
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,300
The Japanese are in Nanjing.

433
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,500
They killed 30,000 of my colleagues.

434
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,300
They have already reached the gate.

435
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:49,700
And you still want to be the leader of the gate.

436
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:52,300
What do you mean?

437
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,500
When did I open the gate?

438
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,100
Don't talk nonsense.

439
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,700
You taught the Japanese for Li Yuese.

440
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,700
You opened the gate for them.

441
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:03,500
You gave the knife to your own colleagues.

442
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,500
You said no.

443
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:09,900
I didn't.

444
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:12,900
I'm just an actor.

445
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:14,900
I'm just a runaway.

446
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,300
What's wrong with my money?

447
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,300
I want to eat, I have to live.

448
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:19,500
Am I wrong?

449
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:20,700
My mother is still at home,

450
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:22,700
waiting for me to go back to the country and raise her.

451
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:24,700
But the Chinese people in the battlefield of the Subei,

452
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:26,300
because you taught Li Yuese the password,

453
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:27,900
and he died of bleeding.

454
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:30,300
So you don't care about him?

455
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:32,900
You are a high-ranking officer.

456
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,900
You are so good.

457
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,500
People like you,

458
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:37,700
you have no worries.

459
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:39,300
Of course you can live.

460
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:40,500
What about us?

461
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:41,700
Can we?

462
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:43,300
If you are like us,

463
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,700
throwing stones in the ground every day,

464
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:47,900
you can't even live in the village.

465
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,700
Why do you think so?

466
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:55,900
You are right.

467
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:00,700
I'm the one you call

468
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,300
a man who cares about others,

469
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,300
who cares about the world.

470
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:11,900
My father is the deputy commander of the Chongqing Department.

471
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:15,300
He can sit with the committee leader

472
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:16,700
in the committee.

473
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:18,500
He can be a good man.

474
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:20,100
He can be a good man.

475
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:21,700
He can be a good man.

476
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,300
He can be a good man.

477
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:25,500
He can sit with the committee leader

478
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:27,300
and drink tea and watch the play.

479
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:28,500
I don't want to listen.

480
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:30,100
I don't want to listen.

481
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:31,500
I don't want to listen.

482
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,100
I don't want to be silenced.

483
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,100
What I want to tell you is

484
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:54,900
we can't choose our origin.

485
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:56,900
But we can decide

486
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:59,700
what we want to do.

487
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:08,500
We have a family tradition.

488
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:12,100
My father taught me since I was a child.

489
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:14,100
Do you want to know what it is?

490
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:20,300
Respect our country.

491
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:23,100
It is our country.

492
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,100
We are the ancestors of the ancestors.

493
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,100
So, Ting Yi,

494
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,900
no matter what kind of trouble you encounter,

495
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:38,300
you have to know that

496
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,700
I, Gu Yaoshan,

497
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:43,100
will stand in your way.

498
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:52,300
Let's see.

499
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:54,300
We'll decide later.

500
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,900
at all time.

501
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,500
Okay, see you.

502
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:43,700
You're right.

503
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:47,900
Yes, I'll take you.

504
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:49,700
Thank you.

505
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:52,100
I'm sorry.

506
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:55,100
Oh, how was it?

507
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:57,100
The results of the investigation have been released.

508
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:01,100
The victim of the US, Charlie Gou,

509
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:04,100
has a British passport and has just entered the country two days ago.

510
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,100
This is the entry record.

511
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:14,100
Hey, is this real?

512
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:17,100
It's not fake.

513
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:23,100
It's different if you have the power to control the border guards and tax officials, but that's not possible.

514
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:28,100
The military police haven't yet found his whereabouts?

515
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,100
Yes.

516
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:32,100
His car was found at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,

517
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:34,100
where he was staying.

518
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:37,100
It's hard to find the British,

519
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:41,100
and now they've sent people to 24-hour surveillance.

520
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:44,100
The British are not in the country.

521
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:46,100
They've been watching him for 24 hours.

522
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:50,100
But the entry record of the US hasn't been confirmed yet.

523
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:59,100
He hasn't come out of his room for two months.

524
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:04,100
Why did he suddenly go to the United Nations?

525
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:07,100
He didn't want me to go.

526
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:09,100
Fine.

527
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:12,100
I'll take the water and drink it.

528
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:13,100
I'll drink it all.

529
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:20,100
I'll drink your wine first.

530
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:23,100
Chief Takeda,

531
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:26,100
the US is not normal here.

532
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:30,100
Especially during these two or three days,

533
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:35,100
the military police can't find his whereabouts.

534
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:38,100
No one can confirm that he bought...

535
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:46,260
a

536
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:49,100
1000-yen rumor about us in around the internet.

537
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:11,000
Me, Mima, I love you very much!

538
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:27,360
The Japanese are fighting each other.

539
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,200
Don't go.

540
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,760
Don't go.

541
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:35,760
My mother is still in the old house waiting for me to go back to Bai Manhu and raise her.

542
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,760
Bai Manhu...

543
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,760
Bai Manhu...

544
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,760
Hold on...

545
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,760
I'm going to the Red Fortress.

546
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,760
I'm going to the Red Fortress.

547
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,760
Come on!

548
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,760
We are just ordinary people.

549
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,760
War has nothing to do with me.

550
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,760
You taught the Japanese about the Red Fortress

551
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,760
because you opened the gates for them!

552
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,760
Bai Manhu is a high-ranking officer.

553
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,760
Gu Yaoshan, open the gates!

554
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,760
Bai Manhu is a high-ranking officer!

555
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,760
No Japanese can go there!

556
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,760
Gu Yaoshan! Open the gates, Gu Yaoshan!

557
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,760
Gu Yaoshan, I'm begging you!

558
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,760
Open the gates! I want to go back to Bai Manhu!

559
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,760
I'm begging you!

560
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,760
Gu Yaoshan!

561
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,760
Open the gates!

562
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,760
What's wrong?

563
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,760
Gu Yaoshan, tell me, what's going on in Bai Manhu?

564
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,760
What's going on?

565
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,760
In the current situation,

566
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,760
Bai Manhu can't survive 72 hours.

567
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,760
They...

568
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,760
By the way,

569
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,760
your father is a commander, isn't he?

570
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,760
Send troops to protect Bai Manhu

571
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,760
and your mother!

572
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,760
I know you can't get away with this.

573
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,760
I'll go back to my mother!

574
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,760
Don't stop me!

575
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,760
I want to save Bai Manhu and your mother, too.

576
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,760
But what can I do?

577
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,760
The Japanese army is in Bai Manhu.

578
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,760
We don't know their plans.

579
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,760
It's a waste of time.

580
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,760
What will you do when you go back alone?

581
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,760
You can't even get in by yourself!

582
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,760
What should I do?

583
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,760
I can't leave my mother alone!

584
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,760
So the most important thing now

585
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,760
is to change the enemy's battle code.

586
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,760
Only then can we understand

587
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,760
the enemy's battle plan

588
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,760
and turn the situation around.

589
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,760
Only then can you save your mother.

590
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,760
But unfortunately,

591
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,760
we only have three days.

592
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,760
Just three days.

593
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,760
So this is the reason why you came to me.

594
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,760
Master,

595
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,760
you haven't eaten anything for a day.

596
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,760
This is your favorite noodles.

597
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,760
You made it yourself.

598
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,760
Master,

599
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,760
if you insist on leaving, I won't stop you.

600
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,760
But before you leave,

601
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,760
eat this noodles.

602
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,760
Or you'll starve.

603
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,760
Try it.

604
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,760
Uncle Gu's noodles are different from others.

605
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,760
Come on.

606
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,760
I'm the one who can't leave this place.

607
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,760
I won't leave without eating noodles.

608
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,760
But you should.

609
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,760
You have to.

610
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,760
I don't want to leave.

611
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,760
You have to.

612
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,760
You have to.

613
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,760
I'll eat.

614
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,760
I'll eat.

615
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,760
I'll eat.

616
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,760
You have to.

617
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,760
I'll eat.

618
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,760
I'll eat.

619
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,760
I'll eat.

620
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:21,760
Before the first five days, Li Yuese taught me the Go game for almost a month.

621
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:24,760
Plus the chess game I used to play with Chang Heren.

622
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,760
That's how I got a tie with Wu Tian.

623
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:28,760
White 80.

624
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:29,760
Tian Yuan.

625
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,760
White 23.

626
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,760
One three cut.

627
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,760
White 10.

628
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:46,760
One three cut.

629
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:48,760
White 11.

630
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:54,760
You're just trying to get away from the game.

631
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,760
Actually, if it was really Wu Tian,

632
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,760
he would have seen it when I was just starting to plan.

633
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:07,760
Yanshan, Yanshan, you've found a good helper.

634
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,760
Okay, you guys continue.

635
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,760
I have a meeting, I'll go first.

636
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,760
You guys talk.

637
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:16,760
Teacher, take care.

638
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:21,760
Musma, also known as Morse code.

639
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:22,760
Excuse me.

640
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,760
Li Yuese taught me all these before.

641
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:29,760
How about we just go straight to the difficult part?

642
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,760
Okay, let's get straight to the topic.

643
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,760
How to pass on the message.

644
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,760
The organization believes that

645
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,760
the code to break Li Yuese's code is good for the war.

646
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:46,760
So, I agree with you to support him from the side.

647
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:49,760
Help Ding Yi to protect his safety.

648
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:51,760
But,

649
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,760
it must not be exposed.

650
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:55,760
Understood.

651
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:03,760
If I want to pass this command to the troops outside Baili,

652
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:06,760
the way we encrypt it is still using the traditional code.

653
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:09,760
So, the encryptor will be corresponding to the code.

654
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,760
Each of the characters in this command

655
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,760
will be encrypted into four Arab numbers.

656
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:19,760
Then, the encryptor will use Musma to pass this command

657
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:23,760
to the encryptor outside Baili through wireless power.

658
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,760
The encryptor will record it on paper.

659
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:30,760
Then, the encryptor will pass the recorded eight encrypted numbers

660
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,760
to the telecom.

661
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:36,760
The telecom will then encrypt the encrypted numbers

662
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:39,760
to translate into Chinese.

663
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:44,760
Finally, the command will be passed to their commander.

664
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,760
So, you mean

665
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:53,760
we just have to pass the encrypted numbers to them?

666
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,760
I also want to pass the encrypted numbers to the enemy.

667
00:39:58,760 --> 00:39:59,760
But, you know,

668
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:03,760
the encrypted numbers are more important than life.

669
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:06,760
So, it's not that we can get them as we want.

670
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,760
But, the encryption method is the same.

671
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,760
So, without the encrypted numbers,

672
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:14,760
we can find the code and the current information

673
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:16,760
and find the code and then decrypt it.

674
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:17,760
So,

675
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:21,760
as long as there are enough samples of the same code,

676
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,760
we can hope to decrypt it.

677
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:25,760
Yes.

678
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:29,760
So, there is no absolute safe code in this world.

679
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:31,760
Unless...

680
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:37,760
Unless the number of the corresponding messages is not fixed.

681
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,760
It seems that you are smarter than I thought.

682
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:45,760
Kondo,

683
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:51,760
you are the best encryption decrypter expert in the U.S.

684
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:56,760
Do you think he is suspicious of the position of the expert?

685
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:01,760
I have been studying his classes for the past two months.

686
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:03,760
But,

687
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:09,760
he has never studied the number of encrypted observations in his classes.

688
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:14,760
He has finished his classes before going to the Empire and then returns to the hotel.

689
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:22,760
But why is the number of encrypted messages fixed?

690
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,760
You have too many questions.

691
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:34,760
So,

692
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:41,760
all the things he has shown us so far

693
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:45,760
are just a small thing.

694
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:47,760
Yes.

695
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:50,760
All of these are definitely hidden.

696
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,760
He has a secret that is hidden from everyone,

697
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:57,760
including the fact that he has a bad eye.

698
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:34,760
I have a secret.

699
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:35,760
I have a secret.

700
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:36,760
I have a secret.

701
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:37,760
I have a secret.

702
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:38,760
I have a secret.

703
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:39,760
I have a secret.

704
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:40,760
I have a secret.

705
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:41,760
I have a secret.

706
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:42,760
I have a secret.

707
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:43,760
I have a secret.

708
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:44,760
I have a secret.

709
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:45,760
I have a secret.

710
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:46,760
I have a secret.

711
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:47,760
I have a secret.

712
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:48,760
I have a secret.

713
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:49,760
I have a secret.

714
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:50,760
I have a secret.

715
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:51,760
I have a secret.

716
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:52,760
I have a secret.

717
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:53,760
I have a secret.

718
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:54,760
I have a secret.

719
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:55,760
I have a secret.

720
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:56,760
I have a secret.

721
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:57,760
I have a secret.

722
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:58,760
I have a secret.

723
00:42:58,760 --> 00:42:59,760
I have a secret.

724
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:00,760
I have a secret.

725
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:01,760
I have a secret.

726
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:02,760
I have a secret.

727
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:03,760
I have a secret.

728
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:04,760
I have a secret.

729
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:05,760
I have a secret.

730
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:06,760

00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:14,760
I have a secret.

739
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:15,760
I have a secret.

740
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:16,760
I have a secret.

741
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:17,760

746
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:22,760
I have a secret.
