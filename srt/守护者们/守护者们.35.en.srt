罗密欧

罗密欧

00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,160
罗密欧

9
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,160
罗密欧

10
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,160
你为什么是罗密欧

11
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,160
美规即使换了一个名字

12
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,160
也依然芬芳

13
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,160
与我有仇的只有你的姓氏

14
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,160
你不信蒙太的故事

15
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,160
依然是你

16
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,160
什么台色宫邸

17
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,160
做作

18
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,160
哎呀

19
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,160
哎呀

20
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,160
哎呀

21
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,160
慢点啊

22
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,160
丁一同志

23
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,160
您的搭档

24
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,160
顾杨山先生

25
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,160
于1973年在台北

26
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,160
荣民总医院病逝

27
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,160
截至今日

28
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,160
三十年保密期已过

29
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,160
临终前

30
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,160
他最后一句嘱咐

31
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,160
就是要把这个

32
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,160
交到您的手上

33
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,160
请

34
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,160
请

35
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,160
请

36
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,160
满飞的夜

37
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,160
风雨

38
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,160
被

39
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,160
归了

40
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,160
风雨

41
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,160
老师

42
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,160
供叠罗汉

43
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,160
和他的上线显必运街头的时候

44
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,160
没有我发现

45
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,160
这次

46
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,160
这次

47
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,160
这次

48
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,160
这次

49
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,160
这次

50
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,160
这次

51
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,160
这次

52
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,160
这次

53
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,160
这次

54
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,160
这次

55
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,160
没有我发现

56
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,160
双手击毙

57
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,160
从楼顶掉下来了

58
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,160
老师

59
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,160
坐下

60
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,160
说什么

61
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,160
怎么回事啊

62
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,160
老师

63
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,160
千算万算没想到这个罗汉

64
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,160
是个供叠啊

65
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,160
昨天晚上我在监听的时候

66
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,160
发现了一部神秘的

67
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,160
电台在发爆

68
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,160
我就问了密店处的同事

69
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,160
这是罗副站长

70
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,160
前几天刚刚申请的新电台

71
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,160
您知道吗

72
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,160
说是要执行什么秘密任务

73
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,160
新的电台

74
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,160
行 看来你也不知道

75
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,160
您说说

76
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,160
放这站里的电台不用 他申请新的电台

77
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,160
发送他自己的私码

78
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,160
这不是通共证是什么呀

79
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,160
他也没想起要出备份

80
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,160
还真备份了

81
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,160
但是是一本假的

82
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,160
我发现他在发报之后

83
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,160
就打给了解药处

84
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,160
强行从他手里把这本密码本

85
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,160
给拿过来 结果

86
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,160
一对照报文 发现一个字都

87
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,160
对照不上

88
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,160
老师

89
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,160
情报工作作家

90
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,160
那是叛国大罪

91
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,160
那我想问问老师是不是

92
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,160
单凭这一点我就能击毙他

93
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,160
这怎么可能呢

94
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,160
他带的那些人呢

95
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,160
都死了

96
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,160
原本我以为就是他们两个案子解脱

97
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,160
结果在我跟他们发生交火

98
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,160
之后他的余党

99
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,160
也冲了出来

100
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,160
这是我的枪子弹

101
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,160
打光了 这是从他手下的

102
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,160
余党那儿搅来的

103
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,160
也打光了

104
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,160
杨山命好

105
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,160
杨山活下来了

106
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,160
都死了

107
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,160
罗副站长是共谍

108
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,160
他手上杀了那么多的共产党

109
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:38,160
倒是你有所不知

110
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,160
虽然他杀了共产党

111
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,160
他也出卖过自己的同党

112
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:46,160
早些年他被左总目

113
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,160
抓去夷英阁关押起来的时候

114
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,160
他就出卖过我

115
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,160
报告 查验过了

116
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,160
女共谍胸口的子弹

117
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,160
确实是顾处长枪里的

118
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,160
是顾处长杀了女共谍

119
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,160
你没看错啊

120
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,160
错不了 罗副站长特意

121
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,160
交代过顾处长枪里的

122
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,160
每一颗子弹都要走特殊

123
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,160
标记 楼里的所有人都死

124
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,160
于这种子弹 包括显毕云

125
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,160
我早就在站里给他的

126
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,160
配单上面画了

127
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,160
标记 即便你

128
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,160
杀了我

129
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,160
顾杨山逃离不了

130
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,160
甘心

131
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,160
等会儿

132
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,160
等会儿 你说什么

133
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,160
我的子弹做了标记

134
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,160
拿给我看看

135
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,160
我们两个

136
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,160
都会死在

137
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,160
顾杨山的枪下

138
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,160
你干什么显毕云

139
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,160
老师

140
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,160
老师

141
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,160
党国还是不信我

142
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,160
杨山

143
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,160
不是党国不信任你

144
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,160
罗副站长是共谍

145
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,160
实在是没有人相信

146
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,160
共产党马上就要

147
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,160
打进城来了

148
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,160
你说这个时候他给我捅了

149
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,160
这么大楼子

150
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,160
真晦气

151
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,160
真晦气

152
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,160
杨山

153
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,160
站里边还有很多

154
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,160
重要的事情需要我去收尾

155
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,160
罗副站长叛党的事

156
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,160
咱们以后再查

157
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,160
出队

158
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,160
杨山 线上处理完以后

159
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,160
马上给我回来

160
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,160
收队

161
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,160
走

162
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,160
他们都走了

163
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,160
密码本呢

164
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,160
我拿到的那本密码本是假的

165
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,160
真的密码本一定还在罗汉那

166
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,160
我一定会找到

167
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,160
好

168
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,160
快去找

169
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,160
走

170
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,160
走

171
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,160
走

172
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,160
走

173
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,160
走

174
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,160
快去找

175
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,160
我马上回去找

176
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,160
找到之后我就发给你

177
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,160
然后你就准备发报

178
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,160
好

179
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,160
我马上回去准备

180
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,160
对不起

181
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,160
对不起

182
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,160
一定要找到密码本

183
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,160
不能让碧云白白牺牲

184
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,160
别死

185
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,160
我已经是死了

186
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,160
是死了这我的人

187
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,160
别是死

188
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,160
你不能死

189
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,160
只剩你一个人了

190
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,160
走

191
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,160
走

192
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,160
走

193
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,160
走

194
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,160
走

195
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,160
怎么证明我存在

196
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,160
来改过我们所有的无奈

197
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,160
在人们无数次承诺里

198
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,160
怎么还有调穿不肯放你

199
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,160
走

200
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,160
他带着幼稚的真理

201
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,160
还炫耀着出手的真意

202
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,160
不 志愿加入中国共产党

203
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,160
不怕困难

204
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,160
不怕牺牲

205
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,160
为共产主义事业

206
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,160
为共产主义事业

207
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,160
为共产主义事业

208
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,160
奋斗道德

209
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,160
奋斗道德

210
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,160
奋斗道德

211
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,160
老师

212
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,160
大师

213
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,160
大师

214
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,160
老师

215
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,160
大师

216
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,160
大师

217
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,160
大师

218
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,160
大师

219
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,160
大师

220
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,160
大师

221
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,160
大师

222
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,160
大师

223
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,160
大师

224
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,160
大师

225
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,160
I've sent the Chinese to the party.

226
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,160
But, Professor,

227
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,160
the plan was set up by

228
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,160
these outstanding people

229
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,160
personally set up by Chief Wang.

230
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,160
If the party wants to attack the mainland,

231
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,160
these people are

232
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,160
very good intelligence professionals.

233
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,160
But,

234
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,160
if you're afraid of being cheated,

235
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,160
these passports

236
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,160
will definitely be given to the Communist Party.

237
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,160
If we don't get the passports,

238
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,160
we can't contact these people.

239
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,160
Then these people will be wiped out.

240
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,160
Professor,

241
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,160
what should we do if the Chinese army comes?

242
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,160
I remember now.

243
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,160
If you have a project

244
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,160
that has been put on the plane in advance,

245
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,160
let's go there and find it.

246
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,160
Go.

247
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,160
Hurry up.

248
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,160
Go.

249
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,160
What did you send?

250
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,160
Professor, the light is broken.

251
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,160
What do you care about the light?

252
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,160
Hurry up.

253
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,160
Hurry up.

254
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,160
Hurry up, everybody.

255
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,160
Hurry up.

256
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,160
Not by me.

257
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,160
Hurry up.

258
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,160
I can't wait anymore.

259
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,160
Hurry up.

260
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,160
Be careful.

261
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,160
This is Tsinghua Lake.

262
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,160
The Chinese planes are all here.

263
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,160
Yes, they are all here.

264
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,160
Go and find them.

265
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,160
They are all gone.

266
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,160
Go.

267
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,160
Hurry up.

268
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,160
What are you looking for, Shan?

269
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,160
The plane is about to take off.

270
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,160
It's too late if we don't go.

271
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,160
The Chinese army is about to come in.

272
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:25,160
I have another car that I didn't bring here.

273
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:28,160
There is a clear picture of the Heavenly Maid's

274
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,160
scattered painting over there.

275
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:32,160
I finally got it from the traitor.

276
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,160
It's worth it.

277
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:36,160
I don't even want the Heavenly Maid.

278
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,160
What are you looking for?

279
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,160
Are you crazy?

280
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,160
Professor,

281
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,160
we are in Taiwan without the password.

282
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,160
How can we explain to Director Mao

283
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,160
that we are in Taiwan?

284
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,160
How can we explain to Director Mao

285
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,160
that we are in Shanghai?

286
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,160
We are in Shanghai.

287
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,160
We are in Shanghai.

288
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,160
How can we explain to Director Mao

289
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,160
that we are in Shanghai?

290
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:56,160
Is it important to explain or is it important to die?

291
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,160
Say it!

292
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,160
There are a lot of enemy troops inside.

293
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,160
There are also American pilots.

294
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,160
Why don't we wait a little longer?

295
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,160
The Chinese army is about to come in.

296
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,160
No, I have to go in.

297
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,160
Report, Director Gu.

298
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,160
I just checked at the airport.

299
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,160
There are two boxes of luggage in the bag.

300
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,160
They are all important documents.

301
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,160
They have flown to Taiwan on the previous flight.

302
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,160
What are you looking for?

303
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,160
Isn't this the God's will?

304
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,160
Liang Shan.

305
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,160
The password is flying over faster than their heart.

306
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:45,160
Go! Go!

307
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,160
Hurry up!

308
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,160
If you don't go, you won't make it in time.

309
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,160
Give me another car.

310
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,160
My God!

311
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,160
Come and get your stuff!

312
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,160
Come and get your stuff!

313
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,160
Come and get your stuff!

314
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,160
Don't look for him.

315
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:39,160
He went to Taiwan on the previous flight.

316
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,160
I have to go to Taiwan.

317
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,160
I'll send you a message.

318
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,160
You let the Japanese come, right?

319
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,160
Gu Liang Shan.

320
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,160
Don't forget.

321
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,160
You have to be a teacher.

322
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,160
You have to go to Beiping to find Meng Xiao.

323
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:06,160
You have to go to the new life in the sun.

324
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,160
Look.

325
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:26,160
This is the mountain of Gu Xiang.

326
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,160
This is the blood of the ancients.

327
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:54,160
Now I have to protect it.

328
00:23:55,160 --> 00:24:00,160
Then Ding Yi, please protect Miss Meng for me.

329
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,160
Protect my homeland.

330
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:12,160
Protect the new life in the sun.

331
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:18,160
Protect the new life in the sun.

332
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,160
Ha kept it safe.

333
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:22,160
Ha kept it warm and issued a letter to businesses.

334
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,160
We are finally released.

335
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:35,160
With family FPS for our brothers,

336
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:37,160
This is a new way to feel safe.

337
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,160
We can only live with elders today.

338
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,160
은

339
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,160
No matter what you become,

340
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,160
I can still hold you back.

341
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,160
Okay.

342
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,160
I will always be by your side.

343
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:16,160
I will always be by your side.

344
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:20,160
We will never meet again.

345
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,160
I will always be by your side.

346
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,160
See you in China.

347
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,160
See you in China.

348
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,160
Rohan?

349
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,160
Okay.

350
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,160
Teacher,

351
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:20,160
with him,

352
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:22,160
the people of Shanghai

353
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:24,160
will be like the Mao's army.

354
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,160
Okay.

355
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,160
Yang,

356
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:36,160
can you tell me

357
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,160
what is your mission in Taiwan?

358
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,160
Tell me.

359
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,160
Actually, I already knew

360
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:56,160
that Xian Ping and Rohan

361
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:58,160
are the same kind of people, right?

362
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:02,160
You wanted to save them, but you didn't dare to go.

363
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,160
Right?

364
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:10,160
Teacher,

365
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,160
if you don't have any evidence,

366
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,160
you can't say that.

367
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,160
This is killing me.

368
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:24,160
Maybe I don't understand much,

369
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,160
but

370
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,160
I think people

371
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,160
still have to be very confident.

372
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:34,160
Rohan has killed so many communists

373
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:36,160
over the years.

374
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:38,160
The communists are crazy.

375
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:40,160
They want to develop them.

376
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,160
But you can't

377
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,160
just think of me.

378
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,160
Chengcheng,

379
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:52,160
don't you see that

380
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,160
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs

381
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:56,160
is always demanding to counterattack?

382
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,160
Without the support of the United States,

383
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,160
the president can't even protect Guangzhou.

384
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:08,160
Or,

385
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,160
we can't see the truth.

386
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:12,160
I'm afraid of Junjie.

387
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,160
When the plane landed,

388
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,160
I ran to the cat's den

389
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,160
to testify to him

390
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,160
that he was a traitor.

391
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,160
If Taiwan can't stand it,

392
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:34,160
you can help me prove

393
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,160
that I have done something good to the Jiefeng.

394
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:38,160
If you have done something good,

395
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,160
what about you?

396
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:46,160
Teacher,

397
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,160
Yangshan has been

398
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,160
studying the secret for years.

399
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,160
If I really have that ability,

400
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,160
then I can tell you

401
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,160
not to wear a high-heeled robe

402
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:58,160
on your head.

403
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:04,160
Yangshan,

404
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:08,160
I knew from the moment you entered school

405
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:10,160
that you were a smart kid.

406
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:20,160
After we arrived in Taiwan,

407
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,160
we started over.

408
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:26,160
We have to help each other.

409
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,160
I'm sorry.

410
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:50,160
What's wrong?

411
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:52,160
I'm cold.

412
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,160
I'm fine.

413
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,160
Sometimes I think,

414
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,160
I really am your family.

415
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:02,160
It's so good.

416
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,160
When the war is over,

417
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:06,160
we can go to the place where the war is over.

418
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:08,160
You can take Miss Mo to the village.

419
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,160
We can leave.

420
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,160
If you have no oil,

421
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:14,160
you can take me to your house.

422
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,160
If I have no face,

423
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:18,160
I can go to your house.

424
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,160
If we have children,

425
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,160
we can take them to the village.

426
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:24,160
If we have a daughter,

427
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,160
we can let them take care of her.

428
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:28,160
Qian Tian,

429
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:30,160
we have a happy day.

430
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,160
Let's remember each other.

431
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:36,160
My heart is thinking,

432
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,160
whether it's you or me.

433
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,160
I'm feeling it.

434
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:42,160
He's watching.

435
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:44,160
Yangshan,

436
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,160
what do you want?

437
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:48,160
The night is so long.

438
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:50,160
The tears are flowing.

439
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:52,160
I want to see the moon.

440
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,160
I want to see the stars.

441
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,160
I want to see the road home.

442
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,160
He's watching.

443
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:00,160
Wandering in the shadow.

444
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:02,160
The night is falling.

445
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:04,160
The night is falling.

446
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:08,160
Looking back, it's already dawn.

447
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,160
Ding Yi,

448
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:24,160
this is the passbook from Gu Yaoshan.

449
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:26,160
The whole organization is in good shape.

450
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,160
You can start to send the report.

451
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,160
...

452
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:56,160
Men, please go to Taiwu at twenty.

453
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:58,160
Find some people with the Zoom,

454
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:01,240
The last batch of

455
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:03,240
anti-corruption actions.

456
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:05,240
The three-democracy will last forever.

457
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:09,240
Didn't you see anyone here?

458
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:11,240
Are you Ruan Qing?

459
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:15,240
Wait.

460
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:21,160
Please collect the dead

461
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,160
who have not arrived as soon as possible.

462
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,160
The code?

463
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,160
Wait.

464
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:27,160
Ruan Qing?

465
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:32,160
Ruan Qing?

466
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,160
Ruan Qing?

467
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:36,160
Ruan Qing?

468
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:38,160
Ruan Qing?

469
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:47,160
Are you Ruan Qing?

470
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:02,160
What's your name?

471
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:07,160
What's your name?

472
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:12,160
The rose changed its name.

473
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:15,160
It still smells.

474
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:18,160
The rose changed its name.

475
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:20,160
It still smells.

476
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:24,160
It still smells.

477
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:28,160
The rose changed its name.

478
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:32,160
It still smells.

479
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:54,160
Long live the People's Republic of Shanghai!

480
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:56,160
Dear people of Shanghai,

481
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:58,160
our people of Shanghai are liberated.

482
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:02,160
The People's Liberation Army has arrived in Nanjing, Shanghai.

483
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:07,160
Long live the People's Liberation Army!

484
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:11,160
Long live the People's Liberation Army!

485
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:17,160

Heng Yue!

496
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,160
Are you sure?

497
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,160
I did!

498
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:28,240
I can talk about14 minutes later!

499
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,400
You have a fragile heart!

501
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:38,620
Are you out of your mind?

502
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:40,920
Don't wash ye standing behind me!

503
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:41,920
Wait for me.

504
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:42,920
Definitely not!

505
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:43,920
My God?

506
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,040
Lee Ya Lo,

507
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:47,700
Please go!

508
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:48,700
You're so dirty!

509
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:51,380
Why are you so dirty?

510
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:52,380
You're so annoying!

511
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:54,420
Okay, get ready for the show.

512
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:56,300
Jian Yi Zhen!

513
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:57,460
Get ready for the show!

514
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:00,580
Why aren't you going?

515
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:02,420
The audience is clapping for you.

516
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:03,540
I'm waiting for you to perform.

517
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:05,060
This rose,

518
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:05,980
is it for me?

519
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:15,380
What's wrong with you, Jian Yi?

520
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:18,260
You're late for the lead role.

521
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:19,300
Next time,

522
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:22,060
let me perform, okay?

523
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:25,380
Ding Yi!

524
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:28,060
Why are you acting again?

525
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,740
But you did pretty well this time.

526
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:34,500
Brother Ding Yi, it's time to perform.

527
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:36,020
What are you waiting for?

528
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:36,740

541
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:07,380
Go, Ding Yi.

542
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:09,380
Aren't you going with me?

543
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:09,980
I'm going.

544
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:10,460
