Episode 18

57
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Old Liang!

58
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Don't be afraid.

59
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Gao Xun.

60
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
It's all my fault.

61
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
It's all my fault.

62
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
It's all my fault, Pipi.

63
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Pipi.

64
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
It's all my fault

65
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
for not being by your side

66
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
and causing you to suffer.

67
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
When we proposed,

68
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I promised to protect you

69
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
and not let you get hurt.

70
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I didn't expect

71
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I would break my promise so soon.

72
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
You proposed?

73
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Did you promise Pipi?

74
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I promised her.

75
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Joseph

76
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
is my fiance.

77
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
That's great!

78
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Biyun, don't be afraid.

79
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Sanyang Li will be your home.

80
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I'll arrange someone to let you live there.

81
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Mrs. Liang

82
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
it's not appropriate.

83
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Mr. Li, you don't know how to care for people.

84
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
All the other ladies

85
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
live in Sanyang Li.

86
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Right?

87
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
She's the wife of the right person.

88
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Biyun, come in.

89
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I made a patas.

90
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Yeah, it's not a problem.

91
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Come on.

92
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Come on, everyone.

93
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Let's raise a toast.

94
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
To Mr. Li.

95
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Cheers!

96
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Come on.

97
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Cheers!

98
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Cheers!

99
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
It's not a problem.

100
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Bravo!

101
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Come on.

102
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Sit down.

103
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
What's going on?

104
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
What do you mean?

105
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
My fiancee is back.

106
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I was about to explain.

107
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
It's a fake.

108
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Don't take it to heart.

109
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
She's acting.

110
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Acting?

111
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
You want to act with her

112
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
and she's acting with you?

113
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I'm acting with her.

114
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Tell me.

115
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
What's her purpose of coming here?

116
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Tell me.

117
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
What's her purpose of coming here?

118
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Protect me.

119
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
We need more people

120
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
and more power

121
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
to protect us.

122
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Why do you make the decision?

123
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Do you know why

124
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Liang Jinyuan brought us here?

125
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Dr. Ning did it for work convenience.

126
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
He did it to control us.

127
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Do you know

128
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
how dangerous our situation is?

129
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Besides, can he help us?

130
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Do you know he's...

131
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Do you know who he is?

132
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Miss Xian.

133
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Okay.

134
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Miss Xian.

135
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Miss Xian is a good actress.

136
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
So next,

137
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
will you let Ding Yi

138
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
act with you?

139
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

140
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Let's put it this way.

141
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Did you promise Ding Yi something?

142
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
That's why he helped you.

143
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
It's his own decision.

144
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Miss Xian.

145
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
You know

146
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
that you don't know

147
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
what Ding Yi thinks of you.

148
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Gu Yanshan.

149
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Is this what you think people think?

150
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Ding Yi is no longer

151
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
what he used to be.

152
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
We can't control

153
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
his thoughts.

154
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Miss Xian.

155
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Ding Yi

156
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
is my brother.

157
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I know he's not what he used to be.

158
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
But I don't allow

159
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Ding Yi

160
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
to be used by anyone.

161
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Miss Xian.

162
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Director Liang.

163
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
That Charlie's job is too hard.

164
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
You don't even help him

165
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
with the luggage of the hostess?

166
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Charlie is Mr. Li's personal assistant.

167
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
It's not mine.

168
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
It's not his job.

169
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I'll help you.

170
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Thank you, Director Liang.

171
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
You're welcome.

172
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I should thank you

173
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
for thanking me.

174
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Ying told me

175
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
that I could go back to Shanghai

176
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
smoothly this time.

177
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Thanks to Miss Xian

178
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
and Mr. Li.

179
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
You're too kind.

180
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Ying is the only one

181
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
who helps me.

182
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I didn't help you.

183
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Don't take it to heart.

184
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I know very well

185
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
who can do

186
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
and who can help.

187
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I should

188
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
leave this kindness

189
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
to Miss Xian

190
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
and Director Li.

191
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Don't worry.

192
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I won't be

193
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
as ignorant

194
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
as Chief Wu Tian.

195
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
He's a shallow person

196
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
and ended up like this.

197
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
That's his job.

198
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I don't understand.

199
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Director Liang.

200
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
We're old acquaintances.

201
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I hope you can take care of Mr. Li

202
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
in the future.

203
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
You said we're old acquaintances.

204
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
It's not appropriate to say that.

205
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
You're a son

206
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
of the Eastland Office.

207
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I have to support him.

208
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Miss Xian,

209
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
if you have a chance,

210
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
help me

211
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
to talk to Director Li.

212
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Director Liang,

213
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
you're too kind to me.

214
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I can't be Mr. Li's boss.

215
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I'm just a

216
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
over-the-top actress

217
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
who can't survive outside.

218
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
So I have to rely on

219
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Mr. Li's care and love

220
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
to be able to make a living.

221
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Miss Xian, you're too modest.

222
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I remember that year,

223
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
you were young

224
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
and you could use your strength

225
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
to send those noisy students

226
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
out of Shanghai.

227
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I've always been

228
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
thinking about it.

229
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Who hasn't done anything stupid

230
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
when they were young?

231
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Didn't Director Liang do it?

232
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I don't think so.

233
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
When I was popular,

234
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
everyone would sell me some instant noodles.

235
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Is it that simple?

236
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
What do you mean?

237
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Biyun.

238
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Biyun.

239
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Jiaxin.

240
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Joseph, are you okay?

241
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I'm here.

242
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Biyun,

243
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
is that you?

244
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
It's me.

245
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I'm here.

246
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Who is this?

247
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Liang Dingyuan.

248
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Sorry to bother you, Director Liang.

249
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
But

250
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
why is Director Liang

251
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
here too?

252
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Why did you come out alone?

253
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I found that

254
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
you weren't home.

255
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I was so worried.

256
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
So

257
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I had to come out to find you.

258
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Director Liang

259
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
helped me bring my luggage.

260
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
We chatted

261
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
at the door.

262
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I have to say

263
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
that you're thoughtful.

264
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Thank you.

265
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
You're welcome.

266
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
But

267
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
don't blame me.

268
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I'm not.

269
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Charlie.

270
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Charlie.

271
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Charlie.

272
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Charlie!

273
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I'm fine.

274
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I'm fine.

275
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Director Liang,

276
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I'm sorry.

277
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Where have you been?

278
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Mr. Li,

279
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I was just

280
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
tidying up Madam's room.

281
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Madam,

282
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I'm sorry.

283
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I'll take care of

284
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
this from now on.

285
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I'll take care of it.

286
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
It's okay.

287
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
From now on,

288
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
you don't have to worry about me.

289
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Take care of Mr. Li.

290
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I'll do my best.

291
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Yes, Mr. Li.

292
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Wei,

293
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
thank you for today.

294
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
It's late.

295
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Go to bed early.

296
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I'm going to bed.

297
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Director Li,

298
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
the road in Sanyang is not good.

299
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Don't let anyone out tonight.

300
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Or you'll fall into my arms again.

301
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Goodbye.

302
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Thank you.

303
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
See you.

304
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Director Liang,

305
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
what did you mean by that?

306
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
You fell into her arms.

307
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I didn't mean it.

308
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I was really stuck.

309
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
She's already

310
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
starting to doubt us.

311
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Do you understand?

312
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
This is the consequence

313
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
of your own decision.

314
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Can you tell me

315
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
what you're going to do in the future?

316
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Talk to me.

317
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I'm your eyes

318
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
in the eyes of others.

319
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I have to stand by you.

320
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Do you understand?

321
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Yes.

322
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Miss Xia,

323
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I'll take you up

324
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
to see your room.

325
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Let's go.

326
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Let's go.

327
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Be careful, Miss Xia.

328
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
This...

329
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
This room.

330
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Here.

331
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I'll put the box

332
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
here.

333
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
By the way, Miss Xia,

334
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
take a look.

335
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
What else do you need?

336
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Tell me.

337
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I'll tell them to do it.

338
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Miss Xia,

339
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
you came to me in such a hurry.

340
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Did you encounter any trouble?

341
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I can help you.

342
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
You were too impulsive just now.

343
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I saw that

344
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
she was always

345
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
pestering you.

346
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I said

347
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I'd help you.

348
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
As a blind man,

349
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
you came out

350
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
alone in the middle of the night.

351
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Don't you suspect her?

352
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
We're obviously

353
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
a married couple.

354
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
So I'm worried

355
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
that you're also

356
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
a man of common sense.

357
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I'm sorry.

358
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I'll be careful next time.

359
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
It's late.

360
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Have an early rest.

361
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Okay.

362
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Then you rest early.

363
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I'll leave first.

364
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Ding Yi.

365
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Miss Xia,

366
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
tomorrow,

367
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
after I enter the San Yang,

368
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I may lose my freedom.

369
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
There's no way

370
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I can get out of here.

371
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I'm afraid

372
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I can't contact you.

373
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
If you need my help

374
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
in a hurry,

375
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I'll think of a way.

376
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Thank you.

377
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
You're welcome.

378
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Good night.

379
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Good night.

380
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Where's the dragon?

381
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I'm sorry.

382
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
You're a good man.

383
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Good night.

384
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
What are you thinking about?

385
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
These people

386
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
always answer

387
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
the same questions.

388
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Everything seems so right.

389
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
You've been with the police for so long.

390
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Did she ever mention

391
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
the proposal to you?

392
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
No.

393
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I only found out today.

394
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Do you believe

395
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
their proposal today?

396
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I think

397
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I do.

398
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Think about it.

399
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Mr. Li is British.

400
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
His family is rich.

401
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
If he gets a job in two years,

402
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
all the foreign companies

403
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
will be closed.

404
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
What if he's blind?

405
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
He's a good man.

406
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
He used to rely on the British

407
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
to get by.

408
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
He had to be afraid of the Japanese.

409
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Hey.

410
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Your Biyun helped us.

411
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
If it weren't for him,

412
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
you wouldn't have been able

413
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
to get back to Shanghai so easily.

414
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
You're right.

415
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
You're right about everything.

416
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
But the simpler things

417
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
are hidden deeper

418
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
in the bones.

419
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
At 9 a.m.

420
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
the military radio station

421
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
will be on the air.

422
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
The password to our interceptor is above.

423
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
In the next few days,

424
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
the radio station will send us

425
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
the secret messages

426
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
of their interceptor.

427
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I will copy them to you.

428
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Of course,

429
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Mr. Li will be busy.

430
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Everyone,

431
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
this is the password

432
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
to our interceptor

433
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
at Shanghai Station.

434
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Although there is only half of it,

435
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I believe

436
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
that with it,

437
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
your work efficiency

438
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
will be greatly improved.

439
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
With this,

440
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
there should be no problem.

441
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Everyone,

442
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
the sooner we get their password,

443
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
the sooner we can get their information.

444
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
So,

445
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
we will have to leave it to you.

446
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
At most, seven days.

447
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Seven days?

448
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Seven days?

449
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Captain Yang,

450
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
seven days?

451
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
That's too short.

452
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Seven days?

453
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
That's too hard for people.

454
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Mr. Li,

455
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
what does the interceptor mean?

456
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
What the Japanese mean is

457
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
that within the specified time,

458
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
there is no way

459
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
to decode this password.

460
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Everyone should be eliminated.

461
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Eliminated?

462
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
What do you mean?

463
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
What the Japanese military department means is

464
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
that if you can't decode within seven days,

465
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
then you don't have to keep it.

466
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
And this elimination

467
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
is to take everyone here

468
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
from the human world.

469
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I can decode within six days.

470
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Five days is enough.

471
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Three days.

472
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
I think three days is enough.

473
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Okay, three days.

474
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
In three days, the mountains will be in full bloom.

475
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
I'll be waiting for your good news.

476
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Goodbye.

477
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Three days.

478
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Miss Xian,

479
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
do you think these people are mad?

480
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I've seen them in a hurry to find a wife.

481
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
I've never seen them in a hurry to find death.

482
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
That Yi Xiu Yuan is not looking for death.

483
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
He's in a hurry to bury you.

484
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Why?

485
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
We didn't know each other before.

486
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
And I didn't offend him.

487
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Think about it.

488
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
If there is a character,

489
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
if it's well-dressed, it can be a double-dealing.

490
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
The original male lead is you.

491
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
I don't know where a blind man came from.

492
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
He said he was from the investment party.

493
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
He's trying to steal your lead.

494
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
What will you do?

495
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
I'll kill him.

496
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
So you mean

497
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
everyone in this cave

498
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
wants to kill me?

499
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
I'll kill you.

500
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Then let's break it.

501
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
What?

502
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Shanghainese are still using this password system.

503
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
If I break it,

504
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
I'm a traitor of the country.

505
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
No, we can't.

506
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
We can't break it.

507
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
If we can't break it,

508
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
we'll just wait here for nothing.

509
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
I'll find a way to contact Luo Han

510
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
and make Shanghainese stop the newspaper.

511
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
When the password is used up,

512
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
we can only break it.

513
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
What are you doing?

514
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Mr. Li is a thief.

515
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
I'm going out to buy him medicine.

516
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
No, Director Liang has ordered

517
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
that from today onward,

518
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
you can only enter and exit the cave.

519
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Director Liang.

520
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Captain Ammu,

521
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Mr. Li is a thief.

522
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
I have to go out and buy him medicine.

523
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Mr. Li's theft can't be delayed.

524
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Captain Ammu,

525
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
if something really happens to Mr. Li,

526
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
we can't take responsibility.

527
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Captain Ammu,

528
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
can you say something?

529
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
You're not saying anything.

530
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
You're just pretending.

531
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Captain Ammu,

532
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
I'm sorry.

533
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
I didn't know you...

534
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Here.

535
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
You can take a break.

536
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
We're all doing things for others, right?

537
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
How about this?

538
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Give me a piece of paper and a pen.

539
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
I'll write down the name of the medicine.

540
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Please take care of Captain Ammu.

541
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Okay.

542
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Please, Captain Ammu.

543
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
What are you doing?

544
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
I'm here to deliver the newspaper.

545
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Search everywhere.

546
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Search everywhere.

547
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
The three-way road is blocked.

548
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
No one is allowed to enter or exit.

549
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Who are you delivering the newspaper to?

550
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
I'm delivering it.

551
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Hurry up and go.

552
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Do you still want to deliver the newspaper?

553
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
You can't!

554
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
What do you mean, Ammu?

555
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Come on.

556
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Ammu,

557
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
you don't have to look at me like that.

558
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
If you look at me like that,

559
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
I'll be sweating.

560
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Chengqing means

561
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Liang Jingyuan is going to

562
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
break our red peach code.

563
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
So he decided to use red peach

564
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
to contain Wang Wei's

565
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
chief of staff.

566
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
My task is to report.

567
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Why are you making it difficult for me?

568
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
I'm not making it difficult for you.

569
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Now we know this mission.

570
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
But Gu Yanshan doesn't know.

571
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
If you keep reporting,

572
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Wang Wei's code expert

573
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
will know the truth.

574
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
I'm not making it difficult for you.

575
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Wang Wei's code expert

576
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
will keep getting our data.

577
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
It's possible to break it at any time.

578
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Before we send out the order,

579
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Gu Yanshan will not

580
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
give us the way to break the red peach radio station.

581
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
With their understanding of Li Yuese's ability,

582
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
they will definitely suspect Li Yuese's position,

583
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
especially Liang Jingyuan.

584
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
He is very suspicious.

585
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
You're just

586
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
sending them to their death.

587
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Chief Cao,

588
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
please,

589
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
please,

590
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
please, give me some time.

591
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
When I contact Gu Yanshan,

592
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
I will report to him.

593
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Luo Zhengyuan,

594
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
you were the one who

595
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
took this action

596
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
out of Shanghai Station

597
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
and was the only one

598
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
who was alone in the end.

599
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Now,

600
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
you are

601
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Gu Yanshan's traffic.

602
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
As for

603
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
how you managed to restore the company,

604
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
that's your own business.

605
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
You cannot affect

606
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
my work in Shanghai Station.

607
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,000
You can't affect my work in Shanghai.

608
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
It's not like you're the one who's getting the credit.

609
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,000
I'm the one who should take the responsibility for the delay.

610
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Chief Cao, are you fighting against the Japanese or being a official?

611
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
What's the difference between the two?

612
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Is there anyone?

613
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Let me show you.

614
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:28,960
Cheating meeting,

615
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:36,960
cheating meeting

616
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,520
Sorry.

617
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:47,300
You.

618
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:50,220
Looking for a country bringish?

619
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:52,420
What're you doing here?

620
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:54,540
No cash?

621
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,420
See?

622
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,500
Wander with my brother-in-law

623
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,260
that I can't go anywhere by myself.

624
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:01,620
Am I a facilitated man?

625
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,280
You go home.

626
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:12,540
Let's go that way.

627
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,900
Go you're soφcking cold.

628
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:19,960
Let go.

629
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:23,160
Put some cold tea down.

630
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,080
I can drink.

631
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:32,980
Jiang Fang.

632
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:36,820
Do you know who I met the other day in Sanyang?

633
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,620
이라

634
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:51,940
Be Assembly

635
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:52,780
What?

636
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:59,700
I'm not in charge of this.

637
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:04,300
You said it.

638
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:08,860
I don't have any words.

639
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:11,700
You can't say that, Jiao.

640
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:13,780
Think about it.

641
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:15,380
They're both your men.

642
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:17,820
I don't have a say in this.

643
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:20,380
I can't help but tell Liang Jingyuan about this.

644
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:22,460
Are they both in charge of this?

645
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:29,900
I told you.

646
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:31,420
You can't just leave me alone.

647
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,340
What else do I have to do?

648
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:37,460
If you have nothing else to do,

649
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:38,420
get out of here.

650
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:44,620
Jiao,

651
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:47,060
you're so smart.

652
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:53,660
Is there anything that I can do to help her?

653
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:55,500
Is there anything?

654
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:16,340
Is there something not right?

655
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:18,740
Of course,úblicion has different reasons.

656
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:19,540
Yes.

657
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:21,540
The wild cat in the neighborhood is in love again.

658
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:25,540
Say hello to Captain An Mu.

659
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:26,540
Take care of it.

660
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:27,540
Okay, Sister Xia.

661
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:31,540
Let him send more people.

662
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:36,540
There's more than one person who can't sleep at night.

663
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:38,540
Okay, Sister Xia.

664
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:45,540
This is the consequence of your own decision.

665
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:48,540
Can you discuss it with me in advance?

666
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:50,540
We are now in the same boat.

667
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:52,540
Good guy went to the room himself.

668
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:54,540
What if you fall down?

669
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:58,540
Besides, Liang Jinyuan said it.

670
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:00,540
Shut the door for three days.

671
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:02,540
He said it, he must have done it.

672
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:05,540
You don't mean to hit the gun.

673
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:09,540
If you didn't see Miss Xia, you could have pushed forward.

674
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:14,540
I was wrong.

675
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:20,540
I'll think of another way.

676
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:27,540
I have an idea.

677
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:42,540
I'm going to leave too.

678
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:44,540
There's one more thing I want to say.

679
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:45,540
I'm going to leave too.

680
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:47,540
I'm going to leave too.

681
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:49,540
There are still 100 more cigarettes.

682
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,540
I'm going to leave too.

683
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:51,540
What about the money?

684
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:52,540
Five points.

685
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:55,540
Liang.

686
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:56,540
Mr. Liang.

687
00:36:58,540 --> 00:36:59,540
Director Liang.

688
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:02,540
Liang.

689
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:03,540
It's so late.

690
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:04,540
Where did you go?

691
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:09,540
Director Li is sick.

692
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:10,540
Let me go and see.

693
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:14,540
I said the scenery in Sanyang is not allowed to enter and exit.

694
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:15,540
Why do you still let him come?

695
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:18,540
I have a business to do.

696
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:20,540
It's not an outsider.

697
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:21,540
What are you afraid of?

698
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:23,540
You, you.

699
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:24,540
Just tell me the truth.

700
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:25,540
Get out of here quickly.

701
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:29,540
Director Liang.

702
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:33,540
Director Li, wait for me.

703
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:45,540
I can't see.

704
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:57,540
Coming.

705
00:37:58,540 --> 00:37:59,540
Director Liang.

706
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:00,540
Director Liang.

707
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:02,540
Director Liang, come in and have a look.

708
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:04,540
Director Liang.

709
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:05,540
Director Liang.

710
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:06,540
Excuse me, madam.

711
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:07,540
Director Liang is here.

712
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:09,540
Come and have a look.

713
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:10,540
Please.

714
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:11,540
Oh my god.

715
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:13,540
You're fine.

716
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:15,540
You...

717
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:17,540
Madam.

718
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:18,540
You're fine.

719
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:19,540
You're really fine.

720
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:25,540
Mr. Li, did you take your medicine?

721
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:26,540
Yes, yes.

722
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:27,540
The medicine is here.

723
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:28,540
Madam, please take a look.

724
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:29,540
It's all in here.

725
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:31,540
Then, take him to the hospital.

726
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:40,540
It hurts.

727
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:43,540
Director Li.

728
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:45,540
Director Li.

729
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:46,540
Director Li.

730
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:48,540
It's my fault.

731
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:50,540
I didn't send you to the hospital.

732
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:52,540
But yesterday,

733
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:53,540
according to the rules,

734
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:55,540
you broke the rule in less than one night.

735
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:57,540
I'm really embarrassed.

736
00:38:58,540 --> 00:38:59,540
I'm embarrassed.

737
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:00,540
Mr. Li.

738
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:01,540
Director Li.

739
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:02,540
Director Liang.

740
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:03,540
Director Liang.

741
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:06,540
Look at him now.

742
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:08,540
If something happens to him,

743
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:09,540
who's in charge?

744
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:12,540
Is it you or Jun Bo?

745
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:14,540
Director Liang.

746
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:18,540
Director Liang.

747
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:20,540
Madam.

748
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:21,540
Madam, I think

749
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:23,540
we shouldn't make it hard for Director Liang.

750
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:26,540
It's not easy for him to recover from the disease.

751
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:28,540
How about I give you a good idea?

752
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:29,540
What do you think?

753
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:31,540
Let's invite Dr. Mengjie here.

754
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:32,540
Wait.

755
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:34,540
Who is Mengjie?

756
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:37,540
Dr. Mengjie is here with Dr. Shwa-Zi

757
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:38,540
and the medical doctor.

758
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:40,540
They've all treated Mr. Li.

759
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:42,540
He's fine now, right?

760
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:43,540
Yes.

761
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:45,540
Let's invite the doctor to check him.

762
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:46,540
He's more stable.

763
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:48,540
Liang.

764
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:54,540
Liang.

765
00:39:57,540 --> 00:39:58,540
Madam.

766
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:01,540
Madam.

767
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:05,540
Madam.

768
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:13,540
Let's invite Dr. Meng here.

769
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:18,540
Mr. Li.

770
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:19,540
Dr. Meng is coming.

771
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:20,540
Please be patient.

772
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:25,540
Mr. Li.

773
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:26,540
Erli.

774
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:29,540
