Screenplay by Zhang Ji-xian

ihrer

34
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:58,440
Director to

35
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:04,440
You said that alcohol can damage the brain.

36
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,440
It's not something that you, a cryptologist, should touch.

37
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,440
Come on, have some noodles.

38
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:28,440
I know that you like lamb skewers the most.

39
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,440
I don't know when you will come back.

40
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,440
I made several dishes. Eat while it's hot.

41
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,440
Actually, I miss this taste.

42
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:52,440
At that time, we could sit together and discuss.

43
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,440
How to deal with Wu Tian?

44
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,440
How to deal with Liang Jingran?

45
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:05,440
It's like the world has no enemies that we can't fight.

46
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:20,440
Jingyu, you should go.

47
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:33,440
I can see that you are not in a good mood.

48
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,440
I'm sorry.

49
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:43,440
I thought that if I wrote this letter personally, at least it wouldn't hurt your life.

50
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,440
It's not easy.

51
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:50,440
But the real purpose of the walking path is to kill the Dongyue Temple family with a quiet hand.

52
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,440
I knew that the content of this letter was not important.

53
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,440
What's important is you.

54
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:06,440
He wants to use you to frame the Dongyue Temple family for colluding with the Yingmei clan.

55
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,440
So he won't let you leave alive.

56
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:17,440
Now the Qingxiang Committee has adopted the password of Xiaowen Tailang.

57
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,440
You have no credit to the Japanese.

58
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,440
I didn't expect that we had a long fight.

59
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,440
In the end, they still calculated it.

60
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:49,440
Why did we end up in this situation?

61
00:04:53,440 --> 00:05:02,440
I've been thinking that if I killed Wu Tian and left Shanghai,

62
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:06,440
would all this happen?

63
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:16,440
You and I can still be brothers.

64
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:42,440
Dingyi, you will always be my brother.

65
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:53,440
Today I have come to this point, I can't choose my birth.

66
00:05:53,440 --> 00:06:05,440
So even if we have walked a long way together before,

67
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,440
we will have to part in the future.

68
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,440
Do you understand?

69
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:29,440
So our friendship can only be behind the fence.

70
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:50,440
Since we have made our choice,

71
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,440
then let's walk on our own.

72
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,440
Let's walk well.

73
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,440
Let's eat.

74
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,440
Eat.

75
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,440
I've never said that.

76
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,440
If I like duck noodle,

77
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,440
I will eat it.

78
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,440
Where are you going?

79
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,440
I'm going to the hospital.

80
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,440
Get out.

81
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,440
I'm going to the hospital to see my wife.

82
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,440
I said get out.

83
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,440
Let me go.

84
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,440
I said I was going to the hospital to see my wife.

85
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,440
You.

86
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,440
What do you mean?

87
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,440
Are you going to kill me?

88
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,440
Don't you know who I am?

89
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,440
How dare you point a gun at me?

90
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,440
Get out.

91
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,440
Get out.

92
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,440
Get out.

93
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,440
Mr. Li.

94
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,440
Mr. Li.

95
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,440
Mr. Li.

96
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,440
What's the matter with you?

97
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,440
What's the matter with you?

98
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,440
Who is it?

99
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,440
I'm here to see you.

100
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,440
Come in.

101
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,440
Joseph.

102
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,440
Why are you here?

103
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,440
I'm here to see you.

104
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,440
What's the matter?

105
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,440
Luo Luo Mo took advantage of the opportunity

106
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,440
of the Japanese military to investigate the English and American forces.

107
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,440
He framed me to secretly steal English and American forces.

108
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,440
He wanted to completely eliminate the entire Dongyuan Temple family through me.

109
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,440
Now I have been suspended from the investigation

110
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,440
and confined in Sanyang.

111
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,440
If I hadn't had a big fight with them this morning,

112
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,440
I wouldn't have had the chance to come out and see you.

113
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,440
I've investigated it clearly.

114
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,440
The patient at the top floor is the chief worker of Dongyuan Temple.

115
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,440
The chief worker has been unconscious.

116
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,440
He's unconscious.

117
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,440
The left side of the coffin can't be held anymore.

118
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,440
There's something more urgent.

119
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,440
The password we designed for the Qingqiao Museum

120
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,440
has been used.

121
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:56,440
Now they've used a password designed by a man called Qiao Ben.

122
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,440
The stop action is about to begin.

123
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,440
And I'm now being suspended from the investigation.

124
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,440
I can't do anything.

125
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,440
And we don't have any time to break this code.

126
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,440
The only way now is to copy the code.

127
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:16,440
Let me follow Qiao Ben and find a way to get the code.

128
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,440
After the investigation for the past few days,

129
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,440
I found that there was only one code designed by the Qingqiao Museum

130
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,440
and the Jiao's radio station.

131
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,440
The code has been written by Qiao Ben.

132
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,440
The others can't be connected.

133
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,440
I can't act inside.

134
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,440
It will expose my identity.

135
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,440
Only you can stop me.

136
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,440
Find a way to get the code.

137
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,440
I'm going to the Qingyao Museum.

138
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,440
Okay.

139
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,440
Excuse me.

140
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,440
Watch out.

141
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,440
Gu Xiaoshan.

142
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:33,440
I've found Qiao Ben's life pattern and whereabouts.

143
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:37,440
We can create an accident on his way to the capital.

144
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:41,440
We can create an accident on his way to the capital.

145
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,440
It's all set.

146
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,440
All set.

147
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,440
The car is ready.

148
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:47,440
Now we only need one more day.

149
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,440
Xiao.

150
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,440
Qiao Ben's photo.

151
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,440
Qiao Ben is a very cunning person.

152
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,440
I can see his true face.

153
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:06,440
But these photos can prove his identity.

154
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:12,440
Comrade Biyun has a very accurate prediction.

155
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,440
In recent times,

156
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,440
Zuo Zuo Mu's private radio station has been frequently reported.

157
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:22,440
We are responsible for the work of comrade who wrote the code.

158
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,440
We finally deciphered most of the information.

159
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,440
Look.

160
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,440
This is what was reported today.

161
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:35,440
Ding Cangfeng, the giver.

162
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,440
What?

163
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:44,440
Zuo Zuo Mu wants to kill the new chief of the Daguang Sect?

164
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:47,440
He is more afraid of the chief than we are.

165
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,440
But if the chief really dies,

166
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:54,440
Ding Yi will lose the protection against Zuo Zuo Mu.

167
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:59,440
So we can't let Zuo Zuo Mu succeed.

168
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,440
How about letting Ding Yi get this telegram?

169
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,440
I don't think so.

170
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:12,440
The fake adoptive father has made him suspect Li Yue Se.

171
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:19,440
But it's hard to convince the four families with a telegram.

172
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,440
Yes.

173
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,440
How about this?

174
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,440
Let Biyun cooperate with this telegram.

175
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,440
Write a good script.

176
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,440
Let's help him to finish the play.

177
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:36,440
Then they can know the real face of Zuo Zuo Mu.

178
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,440
It's working.

179
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,440
Ding Yi is being checked by the quarantine at this time.

180
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,440
It's not a coincidence.

181
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,440
Zuo Zuo Mu should know that if he succeeds,

182
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:04,440
the Daguang will wake up and his good days will end.

183
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:10,440
For Ding Yi, the Daguang will be in danger.

184
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:22,440
I thought the four families of Dongyuan were his protectors.

185
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:26,440
Now it's a big threat.

186
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:31,440
So we have to take this threat down and throw it out.

187
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:41,440
This medicine can make people unconscious in a short time.

188
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,440
It won't have any other effect.

189
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,440
I said you must control the amount of medicine.

190
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,440
Don't worry. I know it.

191
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:55,440
Biyun, our purpose is to make him unable to do surgery

192
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,440
and wake up Daguang.

193
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,440
We can also make a fake image of Dr. Aida Hua's death.

194
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,440
Let Zuo Zuo Mu stop the assassination, right?

195
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,440
Yes.

196
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,440
But there is one thing I don't understand.

197
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:15,440
Why do we have to set fire to the bridge?

198
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,440
The relationship between him and Zuo Zuo Mu is not that close.

199
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:24,440
The position of the secret code member of the Xin Xiang Committee is very important.

200
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,440
Zuo Zuo Mu will choose a very reliable confidant.

201
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,440
Okay, I understand.

202
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,440
You are the adopted daughter of the four great masters of Dongyuan.

203
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:48,440
You are also the only agent of the four families of Dongyuan.

204
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:51,440
She will go to Dr. Aida Hua every night.

205
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:59,440
Tonight, you must let her run around the office of Dr. Aida Hua.

206
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,440
Yes, come in.

207
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:18,440
Sir, this is the inspection report for the top lab ward.

208
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,440
Yes, thank you.

209
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,440
Are you okay?

210
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,440
It's okay.

211
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,440
Take these to the nurses, please.

212
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,440
Okay.

213
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,440
Please.

214
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,440
I'm sorry.

215
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,440
I'm sorry.

216
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,440
I'm sorry.

217
00:18:43,440 --> 00:19:07,120
Ughp delicate

218
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,120
It's raining so heavily. Are you still going?

219
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,120
Hurry up. Hurry up.

220
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,720
Sir, it's raining so heavily.

221
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,720
If you're in a hurry, please come and help me.

222
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,720
Okay. Thank you.

223
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:42,120
This is the only way for Qiao Ben to get to work.

224
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,120
I will dig a water pit on the human path.

225
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:47,120
If he wants to go there, he can only dig a water pit.

226
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:54,120
I've observed it.

227
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,120
The high-pressure wires in the inner part are old and broken.

228
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:58,120
I cut off one end in advance.

229
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,120
I made a fire knot and tied it to the wire.

230
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,120
As long as Qiao Ben digs the water pit,

231
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,120
I cut off the wire.

232
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,120
The wire will naturally fall into the water pit.

233
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,120
This will cause Qiao Ben to accidentally touch the water pit.

234
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,120
The water is boiling.

235
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,120
When the time comes, we will make a rescue plan.

236
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,120
We will send him to the hospital.

237
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,120
We will be able to help him prepare the code.

238
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,120
We will leave all the traces.

239
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,120
Move aside!

240
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,120
Move aside!

241
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,120
What's the situation?

242
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,120
A rainstorm has hit the house.

243
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,120
Hurry!

244
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,120
Doctor.

245
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,120
What happened?

246
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,120
What happened?

247
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,120
Japanese.

248
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,120
Hey!

249
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,120
Japanese, don't send him here!

250
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,120
We don't dare to send a Japanese!

251
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,120
Let's go!

252
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,120
Let's go!

253
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,120
Get in the car! The Japanese are coming!

254
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,120
What's going on?

255
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,120
What happened?

256
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,120
The person who took the gun

257
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,120
was the one who was in the camp.

258
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,120
They are the Communist Party.

259
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,120
What's going on?

260
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,120
What's going on?

261
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,120
What's going on?

262
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,120
Ding Yi has already betrayed us, right?

263
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,120
Why did you hide it from us?

264
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,120
You betrayed us, right?

265
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,120
I didn't!

266
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,120
But I can't tell you.

267
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,120
We are partners! Why can't you tell us?

268
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,120
You know it, don't you?

269
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,120
It's so hard to get out of the camp

270
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,120
without the help of the Japanese.

271
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,120
If the Chinese know that our informants

272
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,120
are being controlled,

273
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,120
they will stop the operation.

274
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,120
But I finally got into the enemy's camp.

275
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,120
I can't give up.

276
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,120
If we fail today,

277
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,120
can you take the responsibility?

278
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,120
I'm sorry, Lu Han.

279
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,120
Since Ding Yi was executed,

280
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,120
I've been looking for a chance

281
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,120
to end our alliance.

282
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,120
I waited for this chance

283
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,120
until the Japanese

284
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,120
investigated Qingying Food Company.

285
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,120
But I didn't expect

286
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,120
they would use such a group

287
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,120
to take the opportunity.

288
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,120
Don't worry.

289
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,120
I will report my problem

290
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,120
to the Chongqing party.

291
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,120
I will take the responsibility.

292
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,120
You just need to give these photos

293
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,120
to Chongqing.

294
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,120
Dr. Edward!

295
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,120
Dr. Edward!

296
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,120
Please move!

297
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,120
Hurry!

298
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,120
Hurry!

299
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,120
Hurry! This way!

300
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,120
Be careful!

301
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,120
Dr. Edward, please!

302
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,120
Please!

303
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,120
Please move!

304
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,120
Move!

305
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,120
Move!

306
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,120
I'm sorry!

307
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,120
Please move!

308
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,120
Please move!

309
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,120
I'm sorry!

310
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,120
I'm sorry!

311
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,120
I'm sorry!

312
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,120
I'm sorry!

313
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,120
Dr. Edward!

314
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,120
Please move!

315
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,120
Is that body

316
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,120
the one you're looking for?

317
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,120
Yes. Please leave it to me.

318
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,120
Oh no!

319
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,120
I'll go get it!

320
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,120
Please!

321
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,120
I'm so sorry!

322
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,120
Please!

323
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,120
Please!

324
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,120
Please!

325
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,120
Please!

326
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,120
Please!

327
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,120
Dr. Edward!

328
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,120
Why are you hurt?

329
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,120
I...

330
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,800
You both stay here.

331
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:48,580
Don't go in yet.

332
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:50,420
No.

333
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:53,880
Okay.

334
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:55,960
Let's go.

335
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:57,520
Listen.

336
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:59,480
Don't disappoint yourself forfeited.

337
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:02,140
If you show your face and say,

338
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:03,900
I'm not good enough for you.

339
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:07,000
I'd die if I don't pay remain death

340
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,500
to get what my mother deserved.

341
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,360
Zeyin is my friend.

342
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:13,500
We can take nice pictures together for reference.

343
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:14,500
I dare not to be reckless.

344
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,500
But this time I didn't get the code book.

345
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:23,500
If I want to steal it from them again,

346
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:26,500
it will be difficult.

347
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,500
It's worse than we thought.

348
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,500
Guo Yangshan's action has already alerted.

349
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:35,500
I secretly sent the book to the organization.

350
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:36,500
The organization verified the book.

351
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:38,500
The book is his picture.

352
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,500
His real name is Zuo Zuo Mu Tai Lang.

353
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,500
He is Zuo Zuo Mu's son.

354
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:06,500
Did you find the man who brought you here?

355
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:07,500
Did you find him?

356
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:08,500
I have recovered.

357
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:11,500
But the man is a fake.

358
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:13,500
If I find him, I will kill him.

359
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:15,500
I hate you.

360
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:18,500
Everyone,

361
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,500
when I was in the prison,

362
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:22,500
I saw Genki

363
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:27,500
taking the man's body.

364
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:32,500
But I have a good relationship with him.

365
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:34,500
What?

366
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:37,500
I...

367
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,500
You bastard!

368
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,500
You bastard!

369
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:43,500
You should not have done that.

370
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:44,500
I didn't do anything.

371
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:46,500
In your body,

372
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:49,500
there is a lot of evil and cruel blood.

373
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:54,500
This army should be completely purified.

374
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,500
I will kill you right now.

375
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:07,500
I will make him look bad.

376
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,500
I will arrest him.

377
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:15,500
I will give him hell.

378
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:34,500
I will kill you right now.

379
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,500
Do you know that

380
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:45,500
Qiao Ben is dead?

381
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:46,500
Who is dead?

382
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:47,500
Qiao Ben.

383
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:48,500
What? Qiao Ben is dead?

384
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:49,500
I knew it.

385
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:51,500
Who did this?

386
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:52,500
How dare he?

387
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,500
He is Zuo Zuo Mu's son.

388
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,500
He is so bold.

389
00:29:58,500 --> 00:29:59,500
Does anyone else know about this?

390
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:01,500
Everyone is talking about it.

391
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,500
Even the son of the young master is still a fool.

392
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:04,500
He doesn't need to die.

393
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,500
This is too much.

394
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,500
Did anyone see your face?

395
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,500
Qiao Ben is Zuo Zuo Mu's son.

396
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:38,500
They will not be so shy.

397
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:39,500
The whole city is going to be sealed.

398
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,500
You should leave now.

399
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:43,500
You can't go any further.

400
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:04,500
You are Zuo Zuo Mu's son.

401
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:07,500
You will find Yu Ying Ge in three days.

402
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:10,500
You should leave now.

403
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,500
It's already like this.

404
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,500
You are still not leaving.

405
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:16,500
Everyone in Sanyang knows that I am a spy.

406
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:19,500
And I haven't been there for a long time.

407
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:22,500
Once Zuo Zuo Mu finds Yu Ying Ge,

408
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,500
he will suspect you.

409
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:26,500
So you have to leave.

410
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,500
But I think

411
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,500
you are the most dangerous person now.

412
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,500
Wu's identity has already been exposed to Luo Han.

413
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,500
So if Luo Han is caught,

414
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:45,500
he might be the scapegoat for his own escape.

415
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:48,500
Of course,

416
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:50,500
if Luo Han runs back to Chongqing,

417
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:53,500
he will definitely report your identity to my superior.

418
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,500
So even if I don't do it to you,

419
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:00,500
my superior will still send someone to kill you.

420
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:03,500
Zui Ding Yi,

421
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:04,500
I let you go

422
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:06,500
for your own good.

423
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,500
You believe so much

424
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:10,500
that Luo Han won't betray you?

425
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:11,500
Of course I believe.

426
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:15,500
Because I am the only one who can see the thorns.

427
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:16,500
Only I am here.

428
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,500
Only the thorns are here.

429
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:21,500
So I can't leave.

430
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,500
So you want me to leave.

431
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:26,500
After I leave,

432
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:28,500
you will tell the Japanese

433
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:31,500
to put everything on my head.

434
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,500
You will say that the person who is with Luo Han is me.

435
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:34,500
But you don't know.

436
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,500
Do you think with our relationship,

437
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:39,500
Zuo Zuo Mu

438
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,500
will believe you without any problem?

439
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:46,500
So last week,

440
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:51,500
the spy letter was already on Zuo Zuo Mu's desk.

441
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:52,500
I don't know.

442
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:56,500
So in the eyes of the Japanese,

443
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:00,500
we have already cut one ear.

444
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:03,500
But I advise you

445
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:07,500
not to think too much about your own fate.

446
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,500
The stage of the five days was already on.

447
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,500
If one day Zuo Zuo Mu's stage also collapsed,

448
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:13,500
do you still have a way out?

449
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,500
Then the skin of the Dongyuan Temple family

450
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:22,500
will be as long as you.

451
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:26,500
You are determined to let me go.

452
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:33,500
If you are in a conflict again during the mission,

453
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:35,500
this time it's bleeding.

454
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:37,500
Then next time

455
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:40,500
it's not as simple as bleeding.

456
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:48,500
Go.

457
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:52,500
Go.

458
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:58,500
As God's will.

459
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,500
The End

460
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,500
Boss, I have made a deal with you.

461
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,500
When we arrive, I will take you two to play.

462
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:49,500
Is it?

463
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:52,500
Japanese.

464
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:02,500
Come on.

465
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:03,500
Come on.

466
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:05,500
Come on.

467
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:07,500
Come on.

468
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:10,500
Get off.

469
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,500
Sir,

470
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:14,500
it's two meters.

471
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:20,500
Come on.

472
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:22,500
Are you okay?

473
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:33,500
Get off.

474
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:35,500
Search.

475
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:36,500
Yes.

476
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:52,500
Come on.

477
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,500
Come on.

478
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:25,500
You bastard.

479
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:30,500
Get off.

480
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:39,500
Where are you?

481
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:41,500
Over there.

482
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:43,500
Stop.

483
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:45,500
Chase.

484
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:47,500
Stop.

485
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:49,500
Stop.

486
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,500
Stop.

487
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:53,500
Stop.

488
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:56,500
Chase.

489
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:58,500
Stop.

490
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:00,500
Stop.

491
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:01,500
Stop.

492
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:22,500
The End

493
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:53,500
The End

494
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:22,500
The End

495
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:23,500
The End

496
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:24,500
The End

497
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:51,500
Japanese.

498
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:52,500
I will kill you.

499
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:54,500
No.

500
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:04,500
Don't.

501
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:05,500
Don't kill me.

502
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:07,500
They...

503
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:08,500
They did nothing.

504
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:10,500
It's me.

505
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:11,500
It's...

506
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:12,500
They did it.

507
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:13,500
I...

508
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:14,500
I...

509
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:16,500
Then

510
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:18,500
they have nothing to do.

511
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:20,500
They have nothing to do.

512
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:25,500
Ready to fight.

513
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:27,500
Ready.

514
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:28,500
Go.

515
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:29,500
Go.

516
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:54,500
Go.

517
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:08,500
Who are you?

518
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:09,500
I told you.

519
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:10,500
This...

520
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:11,500
This guy has been here.

521
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:12,500
Are you sure?

522
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:13,500
Yes.

523
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:14,500
Yes.

524
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:15,500
Sir.

525
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:16,500
This guy seems to be with him.

526
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:17,500
He's with him.

527
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:19,500
See it clearly.

528
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,500
Yes.

529
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:21,500
Let's go.

530
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:24,500
Go.

531
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:31,500
Sir.

532
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:33,500
This is the investigation we confirmed earlier.

533
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:48,500
Every night

534
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:49,500
Do you think

535
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:51,500
that when the show starts here

536
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:54,500
hundreds of people will be killed?

537
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:57,500
Do you think that our investigation

538
00:40:58,500 --> 00:40:59,500
is more difficult than

539
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:02,500
picking up the needle that fell into the sea?

540
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:03,500
This...

541
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:04,500
Is it?

542
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:08,500
Their lives don't matter.

543
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:09,500
What's important is

544
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:14,500
the people who are riding here.

545
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:17,500
The reason you killed Taro

546
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:18,500
is because

547
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:20,500
you wanted to kill him.

548
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:22,500
But

549
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:23,500
only Taro knows that

550
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:25,500
he has the secret code.

551
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:28,500
Only the people from the intelligence department

552
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:29,500
of the new government know.

553
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:30,500
And it's true that

554
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:33,500
the people who are riding here

555
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:34,500
are the people who have been

556
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:35,500
to the UNIS side

557
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:38,500
in the intelligence department of the new government.

558
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:42,500
Your friends

559
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,500
are definitely on this list.

560
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:48,500
Isn't that right?

561
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:48,500
Dish of sauce.

562
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:54,500
Looks good.

563
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:11,500
Delicious.

564
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:18,500
Renqiang, you made this.

565
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:24,500
You made this.

566
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:28,500
It's from White Tiger.

567
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:50,500
Fire is a poisonous thing.

568
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:54,500
It breaks the heat and drags the temperature.

569
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:57,500
Red is through the eyes.

570
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:01,500
It wavers in the weak and helplessness.

571
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:04,500
Flowers touch the morning dew.

572
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:08,500
The fierce body turns into mud.

573
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:11,500
When the day breaks,

574
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:15,500
the first light will shine on me.

575
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:19,500
The big one is lost.

576
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:23,500
No direction, no way out.

577
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:26,500
In the pain of the eyes,

578
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:30,500
the fake play is really hard to say.

579
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:33,500
Where is the wind going?

580
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:36,500
Whose window is shaking?

581
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:38,500
The sound of the doorbell.

582
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:41,500
The heart is thinking,

583
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:43,500
or you or me.

584
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:44,500
The wind is singing.

585
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:47,500
It is watching.

586
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:50,500
The night is long.

587
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:54,500
The tears are floating.

588
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:58,500
The wound is falling.

589
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:01,500
It is watching.

590
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:05,500
The shadow is wandering.

591
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:08,500
The night is falling.

592
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:12,500
Looking back, it is also the night.

593
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:15,500
It is watching.

594
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:19,500
The night is long.

595
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:22,500
The tears are floating.

596
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:27,500
The wound is falling.

597
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:30,500
It is watching.

598
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:34,500
The shadow is wandering.

599
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:37,500
The night is falling.

600
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:41,500
Looking back, it is also the night.

601
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:44,500
The night is falling.

602
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:50,500
Looking back, it is also the night.
