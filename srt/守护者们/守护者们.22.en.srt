Oh, what a show

48
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I hear our hearts rumble

49
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I listen to your jokes

50
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
You

51
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Oh

52
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Oh

00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000

Amada Kune

57
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,040
Very good supplies.

58
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:48,160
What are you doing?

59
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:51,060
I found this at proposer's in London

60
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,640
Boss told me

61
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,800
This pen looked like a broken Dinge

62
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,800
You are better than the dead.

63
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,800
You deserve it.

64
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,800
Good brush.

65
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,800
These two words are his name. I asked someone to paint them.

66
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,800
In other words,

67
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,800
I'll tell you the truth.

68
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,800
It's because Master is not good at it.

69
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,800
He is worried about Zhao Qianhu.

70
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,800
The last three words are not in the script.

71
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,800
There are a few people

72
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,800
who deserve to be worried about Zhao Qianhu.

73
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,800
Repeat it.

74
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,800
Let Shen Wanqing meet at the Chinese Stock Exchange

75
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,800
at the end of the day.

76
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,800
Tell her that you have news about Susu.

77
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,800
Mr. Shen.

78
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,800
I have a question for you.

79
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,800
Mr. Shen.

80
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,800
Mr. Shen.

81
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,800
Mr. Shen.

82
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,800
Director Lin.

83
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,800
I'm looking for Director Shen.

84
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,800
Master is not here.

85
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,800
He didn't come to work.

86
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,800
He left something at home and went back to Sanyang to get it.

87
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,800
Thank you.

88
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,800
Take care.

89
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,800
Wait.

90
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,800
Director Li.

91
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,800
Director Liang.

92
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,800
You just went out.

93
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,800
Where is Charlie? He didn't follow you.

94
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,800
Charlie is sick.

95
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,800
What?

96
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,800
Is there something wrong with Director Liang?

97
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,800
You just came and you're leaving again.

98
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,800
Your work attitude

99
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,800
is not good for others to see.

100
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,800
The first key to the research institute

101
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,800
is to break the secret code.

102
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,800
Even the secret of Director Shen

103
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,800
has been pulled out to help.

104
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,800
Only my research and development

105
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,800
has become a idle child.

106
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,800
So you think there's any use for me to stay here?

107
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,800
Do you go back to the office every day

108
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,800
and sit in the cold plate?

109
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,800
Director Liang.

110
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,800
I'll tell you the truth.

111
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,800
Instead of wasting time here,

112
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,800
I'd rather go back to the office.

113
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,800
I'd rather use it to accompany my wife.

114
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,800
Even if it's a walk, drink coffee,

115
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,800
I think it's a good idea.

116
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,800
Cold plate or incense,

117
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,800
discipline is discipline.

118
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,800
As long as you still have the salary of the new government,

119
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,800
even if you have nails on your plate,

120
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,800
you have to do it well when you work.

121
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,800
Excuse me,

122
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,800
did you say this on behalf of your uncle?

123
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,800
Or did you mean it yourself?

124
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,800
It doesn't matter.

125
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,800
I'm not a good person.

126
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,800
I'm not a good person.

127
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,800
It doesn't matter.

128
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,800
Lamu,

129
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,800
send Director Li back.

130
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,800
I'm going to the office now.

131
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,800
I'll call you later.

132
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,800
Okay.

133
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,800
Bye bye.

134
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,800
Director Li.

135
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,800
I'll get back to work.

136
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,800
I'm going to the office now.

137
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,800
Bye bye.

138
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,800
Bye.

139
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,800
Bye bye.

140
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,800
Bye bye.

141
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,800
Bye bye.

142
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,800
Bye bye.

143
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,800
Bye bye.

144
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,800
Bye bye.

145
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,800
Bye bye.

146
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,800
Bye bye.

147
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,800
Bye bye.

148
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,800
Who sent you here?

149
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,800
You know the person who sent me here?

150
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,800
His name is Gu Fu Hua.

151
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,800
Gu Fu Hua?

152
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,800
He's from the Shanghai War.

153
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,800
He's still a member of the Mei's.

154
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,800
He's a national military officer.

155
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,800
Don't you know him?

156
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,800
But it's a pity, Mr. Shen.

157
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,800
You won't see him again.

158
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,800
Because he's dead.

159
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,800
He died in the hands of the Japanese.

160
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,800
But the steel I gave him

161
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,800
was on your desk.

162
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,800
And on it,

163
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,800
there's a word, worry.

164
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,800
I gave it to him.

165
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,800
So who are you?

166
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,800
Gu Fu Hua.

167
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,800
You are Gu Shixian.

168
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,800
Miss Jian.

169
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,800
I've been waiting for you.

170
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,800
I have something important to tell you.

171
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,800
I have something urgent to deal with.

172
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,800
I heard the Imperial Army is going to Nanyang.

173
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,800
Nanyang's stock is going to fall.

174
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,800
Miss Yi, I have to go back and find someone to cover it up.

175
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,800
If we don't leave the stock, it's too late.

176
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,800
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

177
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,800
So you do know Gu Shu, right?

178
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,800
So you're from the Juntong.

179
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,800
How do you know him?

180
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,800
Why is my steel in your hands?

181
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,800
Who are you?

182
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,800
Mr. Shen, have you broken your personality?

183
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,800
You have to confess everything to me.

184
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,800
Otherwise, you will die.

185
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,800
Mr. Shen, I don't know what kind of people are out there.

186
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,800
Let me go.

187
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,800
Gu Shixian.

188
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,800
Mrs. Li, what can I do for you?

189
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,800
Susu's asthma is cured.

190
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,800
She is safe now.

191
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,800
Don't worry.

192
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,800
You mean Miss Huang from Route 37?

193
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,800
I can't remember her name.

194
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,800
She is younger than me.

195
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,800
Her last name is Shen.

196
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:43,800
Mr. Shen, you have to hurry up and sell the stock.

197
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,800
It's 3.30 p.m.

198
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,800
It's too late to sell it.

199
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:48,800
No way.

200
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,800
I can wait for a few more days.

201
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,800
It's up to you.

202
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,800
I have to go to the right exchange.

203
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,800
I didn't remind you.

204
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,800
You lost the money.

205
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,800
You said I didn't tell you.

206
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,800
Thank you, Mrs. Li.

207
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,800
Miss Yi, you have a big thing to do.

208
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,800
You have to wait for me to come back.

209
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,800
I'll be right back.

210
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,800
What's going on?

211
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,800
Gu Shixian.

212
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,800
Hello.

213
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,800
Gu Shixian.

214
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,800
Gu Shixian.

215
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,800
Mrs. Li.

216
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,800
Mrs. Li.

217
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,800
My apprentice, Li Huan,

218
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,800
gave all his money to the drug dealer.

219
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,800
Do you have reliable information?

220
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,800
That day at the exchange,

221
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,800
you lost a jade orchid.

222
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,800
I have one, too.

223
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,800
An orchid?

224
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,800
Mrs. Li, I don't really understand what you are saying.

225
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:34,580
The opium has a resistant and

226
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,800
Su Su.

227
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,800
Su Su.

228
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,800
Su Su.

229
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,800
Su Su has grown up.

230
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,800
His comrades in the Fulin are taking care of him.

231
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:54,800
Su Su.

232
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:57,800
Su Su.

233
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,800
Su Su.

234
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,800
Su Su.

235
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:05,800
Su Su.

236
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:09,800
He has many parents now.

237
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,800
He has grown up.

238
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:13,800
Su Su.

239
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:36,800
It's my handwriting.

240
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,800
Let me know again.

241
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,800
Hello, comrade Bai Ye.

242
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:47,800
I am the contactor sent by the organization.

243
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:49,800
My name is Ruan Qing.

244
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,800
Finally, I heard someone calling me comrade.

245
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,800
We analyzed that you were in a hurry to meet us.

246
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:18,800
And that Liubei's EIA was watching you.

247
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:22,800
After the death of comrade Lao Hui, we were investigating.

248
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,800
Until we found out the safety.

249
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,800
Can you give me this photo?

250
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:28,800
Let me give it to him.

251
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:34,800
I am satisfied to see Su Su again.

252
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,800
Thank you.

253
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:38,800
Let me get it.

254
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:43,800
Hey.

255
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:18,800
The organization asked me to assist you to continue to complete the secret secret of the replacement of the military.

256
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:20,800
But now Liang Jinyuan has been watching you.

257
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,800
The relationship between the two countries has been changed.

258
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,800
It is not safe to stay in the secret research institute.

259
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:27,800
The organization has arranged an evacuation plan.

260
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,800
We will go back to Yan'an together.

261
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,800
I'm afraid I don't have enough time.

262
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:44,800
Is it your disease?

263
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,800
Comrade Bai Yi, we have arranged a doctor.

264
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:56,800
Failure has spread to the lungs.

265
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:58,800
It is not worth it.

266
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:03,800
I hide it because once the Japanese know my disease.

267
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,800
They will never let me hurt them.

268
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:09,800
I have no chance to continue to implement the plan of the replacement of the military.

269
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:13,800
I didn't expect that I would sacrifice myself for comrade Luo Hui.

270
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,800
The next task is yours.

271
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:25,800
What task?

272
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:28,800
My sister.

273
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,800
Comrade Bai Yi.

274
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,800
I have brought the information of the association.

275
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,800
I have checked their secret.

276
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:41,800
I found that the old general is drunk and trying to attack Huangqiao.

277
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:43,800
He is going to kill our new and dead army.

278
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:51,800
This secret secret is useful to us.

279
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:54,800
I have to go to the military.

280
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:56,800
I have to go to the military.

281
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,800
I have to go to the military.

282
00:23:58,800 --> 00:23:59,800
It is all useful to us.

283
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:10,800
I have already arranged the plan of the operation of the north and south.

284
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:14,800
They want to destroy the new and dead army in the north.

285
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,800
Then they will attack the new and dead army in the south.

286
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:19,800
Miss Qian.

287
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:21,800
What's wrong?

288
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:22,800
There are 15 minutes left.

289
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:26,800
You have to make a decision quickly whether to sell your stock or sell it.

290
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,800
Help me to sell it.

291
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,800
Okay.

292
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:40,800
Hurry up.

293
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:41,800
Hurry up.

294
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:42,800
Hurry up.

295
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:56,800
The new and dead army is in the south of Huangqiao.

296
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:00,800
Only 7,000 people can fight against Han Deqing's 40,000 soldiers.

297
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:07,800
And the north's Eighth Route Army and the new and dead army have 7 days' distance from Huangqiao.

298
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:08,800
And the Japanese are blocking them.

299
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,800
They can't support each other.

300
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:17,800
Although Han Deqing is blocked by the Japanese, I think he will fight them tomorrow night.

301
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:23,800
If the Japanese can't stop the Japanese, we can't stop them.

302
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:24,800
Yes.

303
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:25,800
So we can't delay it for a minute.

304
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:30,800
The reason why I take the risk to try to meet you is because of the emergency.

305
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:36,800
If I can't see you today, the only way I can do is to take the risk and report it to the organization.

306
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:37,800
Contact the organization.

307
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:41,800
This information must be sent back by tomorrow morning.

308
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:43,800
Give me the information.

309
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,800
I will give it to the organization immediately.

310
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,800
I can't confirm your identity before.

311
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,800
I didn't bring the insurance.

312
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,800
Go back to Sanyangling.

313
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:55,800
I will give you the detailed military strategy map.

314
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:56,800
Okay.

315
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:57,800
We will go back to Sanyangling immediately.

316
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,800
I go to the front door.

317
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:03,800
You go to the back door.

318
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,800
Six o'clock.

319
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:07,800
I will arrive at your house on time in the name of Song Shihe.

320
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:08,800
Okay.

321
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:34,800
Go.

322
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:04,800
Go.

323
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:34,800
I'm sorry.

324
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:49,800
I'm sorry.

325
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:09,800
No matter what, i'm here.

326
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,800
You can leave now.

327
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:19,800
Have you only seen a bit of routine?

328
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,800
What should I do now?

329
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:25,800
the word must have swept upon the waves.

330
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:28,800
What?

331
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,800
Go away from here.

332
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:31,800
Go away now.

333
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,420
Quick, get out of the bus!

334
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:38,660
Theycca...

335
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:42,240
They're just in the wake.

336
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:43,500
Back to their beds.

337
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,700
Woo!

338
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:48,300
I don't know.

339
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:51,400
Take the bus.

340
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:53,040
The bus will be a root.

341
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:54,980
He can't sleep.

342
00:28:55,180 --> 00:29:00,620
Otherwise, they're going to send the bad guy outside please.

343
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:02,620
Come on.

344
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:18,620
Mingyue.

345
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:23,620
Mingyue! Mingyue!

346
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:25,620
Mingyue!

347
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:32,620
Mingyue!

348
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:03,620
Mingyue.

349
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:32,620
Mingyue.

350
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:39,620
Don't worry, Li.

351
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:41,620
I'll save your wife.

352
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:57,620
Who fired the gun?

353
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:00,620
The gunner was very quick.

354
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:05,620
I couldn't see his face from that angle.

355
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:09,620
Did you see anyone who had contact with him?

356
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:12,620
He listened to too many people.

357
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:15,620
I lost track of him as soon as I went in.

358
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:20,620
When I saw him again, he was shot.

359
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:26,620
So you're not as smart as I said.

360
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:32,620
Liang Qingyuan, I told you before.

361
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:35,620
There's no need to play this trick.

362
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:37,620
You think Xian Biyun is a spy?

363
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:39,620
Just arrest him.

364
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:42,620
You can't get out of the spy.

365
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:44,620
Your father can't break out of Xi Geng.

366
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:48,620
Then next week, you'll go back to Chongqing together.

367
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:51,620
You know we can't go back to Chongqing.

368
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:55,620
I've already got the list of the killers of the military.

369
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:59,620
I've got all the lives of the Shen family.

370
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:08,620
This is your best chance.

371
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:27,620
I'm sorry.

372
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:57,620
I'm sorry.

373
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:27,620
I'm sorry.

374
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:57,620
I'm sorry.

375
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:03,620
I'm sorry.

376
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:27,620
I'm sorry.

377
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:29,620
I'm sorry.

378
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:55,620
Chief Li.

379
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:58,620
It's so late. You...

380
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:01,620
Chief Li.

381
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:07,620
To be honest, Miss Xian was shot.

382
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:09,620
She's in the hospital. I'm here to help her.

383
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:11,620
Where's the information? Give it to me.

384
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:15,620
Chief Li, I don't understand what you're saying.

385
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:18,620
Your eyes.

386
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:22,620
Comrade Baiye, I know the number of your connection with the organization.

387
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,620
Susu.

388
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:27,620
Susu.

389
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:39,620
Nice play.

390
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:43,620
But the street is never Susu.

391
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:49,620
You're in a hurry.

392
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:51,620
One or two of you come straight to me.

393
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:57,620
Susu.

394
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:12,620
I know why you're here.

395
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:15,620
It's a pity that I don't have time to be with you.

396
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:27,620
No.

397
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:58,620
Susu.

398
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:27,620
Susu.

399
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:58,620
Susu.

400
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:27,620
Susu.

401
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:34,620
Report.

402
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:36,620
Unidentified wire signal received.

403
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:38,620
I'll send it to you immediately.

404
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:40,620
Check it properly.

405
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:42,620
Yes.

406
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:57,620
Susu.

407
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:27,620
Susu.

408
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:48,620
According to the signal, the wireless signal is from the third floor.

409
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:50,620
Keep an eye on it.

410
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:52,620
Yes.

411
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:57,620
Susu.

412
00:39:57,620 --> 00:39:59,620
Susu.

413
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:29,620
Susu.

414
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:42,620
Why are you tied up here?

415
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:48,620
Who is it?

416
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:50,620
Who is it?

417
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:52,620
The third floor is under attack.

418
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:55,620
The whole of Shanghai is looking for the signal.

419
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:58,620
Their car will be locked in this area soon.

420
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:00,620
The signal will be here soon.

421
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:02,620
Let's go.

422
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:27,620
Susu.

423
00:41:56,620 --> 00:41:58,620
Gong Yanshan.

424
00:41:58,620 --> 00:42:00,620
You're a Hong Kong man.

425
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:02,620
A big Hong Kong man.

426
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:05,620
But you're holding a gun and you're a Hong Kong man.

427
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:07,620
I'm telling you.

428
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:09,620
If you kill him today,

429
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:11,620
I'll go to Liang Jinyan and report you.

430
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:13,620
We'll all die.

431
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:15,620
No.

432
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:17,620
No.

433
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:19,620
Can you guarantee that he won't betray us

434
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:21,620
when he's caught by the Japanese?

435
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:23,620
Can you guarantee that?

436
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:25,620
You're an actor.

437
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:27,620
You can act.

438
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:29,620
But you're not a child.

439
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:31,620
I can hide.

440
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:33,620
I can use my own life to hide.

441
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:35,620
But you let me use the lives of the soldiers in front of me.

442
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:37,620
I can't do it. I can't hide.

443
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:39,620
And he just reported it.

444
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:41,620
Their car will be locked here.

445
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:43,620
He can't live then.

446
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:51,620
You're a Hong Kong man.

447
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:54,620
What are you doing?

448
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:56,620
What are you doing?

449
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:54,180
Fire is a single thing,

450
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:58,180
the broken pull is dragging the temperature.

451
00:43:58,180 --> 00:44:01,380
Red is through the eyes,

452
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:05,380
swaying in that fragile battle.

453
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:08,580
Flowers are blooming,

454
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:12,580
the trained body is turned into mud.

455
00:44:12,580 --> 00:44:15,780
When the day breaks,

456
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:19,780
the first light will light up for me.

457
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:23,140
The home is a mystery,

458
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:27,140
there is no direction, no way out.

459
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:30,340
In the pain of the eyes,

460
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:34,340
the fake play is really hard to explain.

461
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:37,540
Where is the wind going?

462
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:41,540
Whose window is shaking?

463
00:44:41,540 --> 00:44:44,740
The heart is thinking,

464
00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:48,340
or you or me are watching.

465
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:52,100
He is watching,

466
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:55,700
the vast night.

467
00:44:55,700 --> 00:44:59,300
The tears are falling,

468
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:02,900
the wound is falling.

469
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:06,500
He is watching,

470
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:10,100
the shadow is wandering.

471
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:12,740
The night is falling,

472
00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:17,300
the night is bright.

473
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:20,660
He is watching,

474
00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:24,660
the vast night.

475
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:28,100
The tears are falling,

476
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:31,700
the wound is falling.

477
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:35,300
He is watching,

478
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:38,900
the shadow is wandering.

479
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:41,460
The night is falling,

480
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:46,100
the night is bright.

481
00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:48,900
The night is falling,

482
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:54,900
the soul is lost.
