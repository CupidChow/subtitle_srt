00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The Long Ballad

2
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Bring her out.

4
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I'll arrange for you and Luo Han to leave in two days.

5
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Okay.

6
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
One more thing.

7
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
My wife is from Guangdong.

8
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
She's not convinced of the water and land here.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I remember after the Hong Kong War,

10
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
the war with the Chen family,

11
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
her position was always vacant.

12
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I understand.

13
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I'll think of a way.

14
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Think of a way?

15
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
That's a good idea.

16
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Young Master,

17
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
you may not know my ability.

18
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I can help you to do this.

19
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I have the list of the new government's special forces.

20
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I believe this list

21
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
can speed up your plan.

22
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
What do you mean?

23
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
You don't believe me?

24
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Bring her out.

25
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I'll take care of the situation.

26
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I'll take care of it.

27
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'll do it for you.

28
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Thank you.

29
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I forgot to tell you something.

30
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
What?

31
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
You have your name on the list of suspects.

32
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I suggest you go with me.

33
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I can't go.

34
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I have something to do.

35
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
What's more important than your life?

36
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
How to kill Zuo Zuo Mu is the most important.

37
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I'll go with you.

38
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I'll go with you.

39
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Hello, I'm Liang Jinyuan.

40
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I have a report for you.

41
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I've got Charygu under my control.

42
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
But he doesn't admit it.

43
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
He insists on facing Rohan.

44
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I think

45
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
we should bring them to the forest

46
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
and ask the young general to make a decision.

47
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Yes.

48
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
We can't help the leader

49
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
to make a decision.

50
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Okay.

51
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Okay.

52
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Okay.

53
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Please call the chief of the county

54
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
and I'll go to the enemy.

55
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Okay.

56
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Thank you.

57
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I'm sorry.

58
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I'm sorry.

59
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I'm sorry.

60
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I'm sorry.

61
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I'm sorry.

62
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I'm sorry.

63
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I'm sorry.

64
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I'm sorry.

65
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I'm sorry.

66
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I'm sorry.

67
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I'm sorry.

68
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I'm sorry.

69
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I'm sorry.

70
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I'm sorry.

71
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I'm sorry.

72
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I'm sorry.

73
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I'm sorry.

74
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I'm sorry.

75
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I'm sorry.

76
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I'm sorry.

77
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
If Rohan is right on her side

78
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
you can't keep her.

79
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
We need to make things right.

80
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
We have to thank her

81
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
to put her and the winter temple on the right track.

82
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
As long as we don't catch her

83
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
No matter what he says to you,

84
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
in the eyes of outsiders,

85
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
these are just a means of fighting for personal interests.

86
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
All the information related to the four families in the park

87
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
must be memorized.

88
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Lin Baihui.

89
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
36 years of the Ming Dynasty.

90
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Si Shuangyuan?

91
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Yes.

92
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
He was born in the period when he was the chief minister of the Ming Dynasty

93
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
and assistant of the Daguang in Taiwan.

94
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
For so many years, he was not named

95
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
because of his mother's identity.

96
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
But he was in charge of the whole Dongyuan Temple family.

97
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
For his sake, the Dongyuan Temple government

98
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
hired Li Yuese's father

99
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
to be his math teacher.

100
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
So he is Li Yuese's father's student.

101
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Then I...

102
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Then does Li Yuese know him?

103
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
You knew each other when you were young.

104
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
What if...

105
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
What if I really meet him one day?

106
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I'll call him Naihui.

107
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
This Miss Naihui

108
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
loves to wear hanbok and comb her hair.

109
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Obviously, she more agrees with her Japanese identity.

110
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
You must remember her Japanese name.

111
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Megumi.

112
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Megumi.

113
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
You remember, don't call her Miss Lin.

114
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
She must not want others to mention her identity.

115
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Calling her Miss Lin is a big mistake.

116
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
You...

117
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
You're defending him?

118
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
That's an act of turning the military into an enemy.

119
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Miss Lin.

120
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
She is very good-tempered and impulsive.

121
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Miss Lin has already made Lin Naihui

122
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
fall in love with her.

123
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Zuo Zuo Mu mentioned her Chinese mother's name on purpose.

124
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
He even questioned whether she could represent the Dongyuan Temple.

125
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
He has already stepped on his thunder.

126
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Then I'll light a fire for them

127
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
and see if this fire can be used.

128
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I'll go and see if I can do it.

129
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Then I'll light a fire for them

130
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
and see if this fire can be used.

131
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Hey, hey, what are you doing?

132
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Thank you.

133
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
What is it?

134
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Is the Buddha's Buddha a holy one?

135
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
No.

136
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I'm sorry.

137
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I'm sorry.

138
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I'm sorry.

139
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I'm sorry.

140
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I'm sorry.

141
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I'm sorry.

142
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I'm sorry.

143
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I'm sorry.

144
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I'm sorry.

145
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I'm sorry.

146
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I'm sorry.

147
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:34,220
Zuo Zuo Mu wants me to bring you to the scene of the

148
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
What can I do?

149
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
What can I do?

150
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Zuo Zuo Mu said

151
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
he would give me a way out.

152
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
The same is the other way around.

153
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Why?

154
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
The other's life is all about life.

155
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
My life is not about life.

156
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
This time, the love failure is my fault.

157
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,000
The party is in a hurry to die.

158
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Just because the father of Gu Yangshan is the father of death,

159
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
he should have killed me.

160
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I'm sorry.

161
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Are you done crying?

162
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
This is what the world is like.

163
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
It's not like that.

164
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Luo Zhanyuan.

165
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
The life of a person is different.

166
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Do you know why you ended up like this today?

167
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
It's because you didn't think clearly.

168
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Whether it's the first day or the day before,

169
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Maqian is the most dangerous.

170
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I'm sorry.

171
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Lao Hua is right.

172
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
A general's life is full of suffering.

173
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Do you want to be a general

174
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
or a pile of suffering?

175
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
It's our own choice.

176
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Hurry.

177
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Young Master.

178
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Young Master.

179
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Hurry.

180
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Hurry.

181
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Hurry.

182
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Hurry.

183
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Hurry.

184
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Are you okay?

185
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Get in the car.

186
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I know the public is in Shanghai.

187
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
But because I have been under close inspection,

188
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I'm worried that if I ask you for help,

189
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
it will bring unnecessary trouble to the Dongyuan Temple family.

190
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
So...

191
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I'm afraid that I can't help you.

192
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I'm afraid that I can't help you.

193
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I'm afraid that I can't help you.

194
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I'm afraid that I can't help you.

195
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Oh, right, Maigumi.

196
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
How is Da Gong's condition?

197
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Now the situation in China is so turbulent.

198
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Why do you have to come to Shanghai for surgery?

199
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Now the international situation is tense.

200
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Dr. Edward is British.

201
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
He is not willing to enter Japan.

202
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
He is afraid of being detained for treason.

203
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
So the two sides can only agree to have surgery in Shanghai.

204
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
But why don't you tell me why you came to Shanghai?

205
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
There are many anti-Japanese in Shanghai.

206
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
We are strictly confidential about this.

207
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
We don't want to cause unnecessary trouble.

208
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Besides, you haven't told me

209
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
why you pretend to be Da Gong's adopted son.

210
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I was invited by Da Gong.

211
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Fu Hua is engaged in password work.

212
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
But you know that as a British,

213
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I came to Shanghai just a few days ago.

214
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I almost lost my life.

215
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Miss Na Hui, don't blame him.

216
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Joseph once designed a set of secret passwords for them.

217
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
But they leaked it to their own people.

218
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
And Joseph came to be the scapegoat.

219
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
If Da Gong didn't have this identity,

220
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I'm afraid I would have...

221
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Na Hui,

222
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
if you were in my position,

223
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
what would you do?

224
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
At least you shouldn't lie.

225
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:36,000
But Da Gong didn't keep his promise.

226
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Does he count as a lie?

227
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
You are so arrogant!

228
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
But this is war.

229
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Every time a war comes,

230
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
morality becomes the first victim.

231
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
When Da Gong took me from the lower tower to the battlefield,

232
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
he didn't give me a single weapon.

233
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
He shouldn't have tied me up.

234
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
When I face the gun again,

235
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I have to be polite.

236
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Sorry.

237
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I just want to live.

238
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:16,000
It seems that the situation in China is much more complicated than I expected.

239
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
That's why I kept Biyun pretending to be injured.

240
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I'm just worried that if something happens to her,

241
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
she will be involved.

242
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I also told her that she could help you in the critical moment.

243
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Is the hospital safe?

244
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
At least under the protection of the Dongyuan Temple family,

245
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Biyun will be safe.

246
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I'm afraid it's not.

247
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
As far as I know,

248
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,000
there are many dead bodies in the hospital.

249
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I'm afraid there are enemies coming in.

250
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Why would they come in?

251
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Are they going to kill Da Gong?

252
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Excuse me.

253
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I'm sorry.

254
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
This clip is too thin for me.

255
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I can't fix it for a while.

256
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I had to use my thumb because I had to use the poison every day.

257
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Did you find out who the dead body was?

258
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Yes.

259
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
But I didn't find it out.

260
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I found out that it was not the dead body.

261
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:52,000
It was the body of Hashimoto Taro, who was serving at the Qing Dynasty Committee.

262
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:59,000
In fact, it was the body of Sasaki Taro, the son of President Sasaki.

263
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Sasaki.

264
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Sasaki.

265
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
What happened?

266
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,000
The doctor who came from the UK from far away from the Dongyuan Temple family

267
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
was poisoned by us.

268
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
You said the hospital was safe.

269
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
How can it be safe?

270
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Poison?

271
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
How is that possible?

272
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
You can't see it.

273
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Of course you don't understand.

274
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Megumi, I advise you to calm down.

275
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I think this must be a secret.

276
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Now all of us want Da Gong to wake up early and come out to host the big show.

277
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:54,000
How can anyone want to poison the main doctor of Da Gong?

278
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Of course it's Sasaki.

279
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:05,000
The night before, I saw someone walking out of Dr. Eideweiser's office.

280
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
The chest is written with Abu's name.

281
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
He has a scar on his hand.

282
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
It's exactly the same as Sasaki's son's body.

283
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
He must be the murderer of Dr. Eideweiser.

284
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
And all of this was ordered by Sasaki.

285
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I remember.

286
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I've seen Sasaki's son.

287
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
He has a scar on his hand.

288
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
It's a moon-shaped scar.

289
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
But...

290
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Say it, Megumi.

291
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
But what?

292
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Sasaki said the scar can be forged.

293
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Of course he would say that.

294
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
But he can't fool me.

295
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Wait.

296
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I suddenly remembered that the cryptography institute received a private telegram.

297
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,000
And this telegram will be released at 1.30 pm every day.

298
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
We just started to develop the puzzle.

299
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Sasaki ordered us to destroy all the information on this telegram.

300
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Megumi.

301
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Is it possible that this telegram is Zuo Zuo Mu's own telegram?

302
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,000
He just wants to use this telegram to command a series of actions against the Eastern Courtyard.

303
00:20:53,000 --> 00:21:19,680
Please read the information inside the

304
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:42,600
I became busy or the

305
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:50,620
the

306
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:52,620
I'm sure you'll be fine.

307
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:54,620
Just hang in there.

308
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:56,620
So in your eyes,

309
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:58,620
they are

310
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:00,620
the Chimei Wangliang.

311
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:06,620
What about me?

312
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:10,620
What about me?

313
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,620
In your eyes,

314
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:16,620
I'm no different from them.

315
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:19,620
What are you talking about?

316
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:21,620
You're my comrade-in-arms.

317
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:23,620
How can you be no different from them?

318
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:38,620
You still don't know

319
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:40,620
anything about me?

320
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:42,620
Liang Qingyuan,

321
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:44,620
did she tell you anything?

322
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:49,620
No.

323
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:52,620
She said

324
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:54,620
she...

325
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:57,620
She told me

326
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:59,620
that the only condition to save you

327
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:02,620
is to be the deputy commander of Hong Kong.

328
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:08,620
You've suffered a lot.

329
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:10,620
You don't have to think about anything.

330
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:12,620
Secretary Wang has arranged a boat for you.

331
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:15,620
We'll leave the waterway before sunset tomorrow.

332
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:19,620
I can't see you off.

333
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:21,620
I have to hurry back.

334
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:23,620
If we wait until the Chimei Wangliang is done,

335
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:25,620
it'll be too late.

336
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:29,620
You can't stay.

337
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:31,620
I was going to

338
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:33,620
expose Ding Yi and the Chimei Wangliang

339
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,620
to her,

340
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:37,620
and then put the blame on them.

341
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:40,620
But in the end,

342
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:42,620
I didn't lie to Chief Zuo.

343
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:44,620
He will

344
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:46,620
question you again.

345
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:49,620
You can't go back.

346
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:50,620
Don't worry.

347
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:52,620
I have my way.

348
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:54,620
There's no way.

349
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:56,620
The Communist Party will kill us.

350
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:02,620
Lu Han,

351
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:04,620
what happened

352
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:06,620
in the Chimei Wangliang?

353
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:08,620
I don't know.

354
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:10,620
Ding Yi

355
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:13,620
shot me.

356
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:15,620
He scared me to death.

357
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:24,620
You said Ding Yi

358
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:27,620
shot you.

359
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:29,620
The Communist Party

360
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:31,620
has always

361
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:33,620
been unacceptable.

362
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:40,620
I'm sorry.

363
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:00,620
Lu Han, I don't know why

364
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:02,620
Ding Yi

365
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:04,620
shot you.

366
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:07,620
But the two sides have different positions.

367
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:10,620
They are different.

368
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:12,620
If Ding Yi is caught today,

369
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:14,620
we will

370
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:16,620
shoot him.

371
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:18,620
Now,

372
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:24,620
will you really shoot Ding Yi?

373
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:28,620
Don't worry.

374
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:30,620
I will definitely shoot him.

375
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:32,620
Liang Xingyuan,

376
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:35,620
are you really going to take Chongqing back?

377
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:41,620
Lu Han,

378
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:43,620
I have my own arrangement.

379
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:45,620
You're a traitor.

380
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:47,620
You betrayed the country.

381
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:49,620
Just because

382
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:51,620
I helped you,

383
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:55,620
you will change

384
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:57,620
the position

385
00:25:57,620 --> 00:25:59,620
of Hong Kong's main battle field.

386
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:04,620
Where is Erhuang?

387
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:08,620
My life...

388
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:10,620
What did I do to my life?

389
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:18,620
Lu Han, what the hell

390
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:20,620
is wrong with you today?

391
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:34,620
I told you to wait for me downstairs.

392
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:38,620
Sorry to bother you.

393
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:40,620
I just want to ask

394
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:42,620
when you can leave.

395
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:46,620
I'm going to take you to see someone now.

396
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:48,620
This person will be responsible for

397
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:50,620
all the things you will do in Chongqing.

398
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:52,620
Liang Xingyuan,

399
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:56,620
what did you do

400
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:58,620
to Chongqing?

401
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:04,620
I will do the same

402
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:06,620
to you.

403
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:08,620
I will take revenge.

404
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:18,620
Stop!

405
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:20,620
Stop!

406
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:24,620
Stop!

407
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:28,620
Stop!

408
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:34,620
Stop!

409
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:00,620
Go to the entrance!

410
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:04,620
Go.

411
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:46,620
If you find evidence that Sasaki killed the Emperor, you will be a accomplice.

412
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:07,620
Sasaki's handwriting is exactly like the one of our mother.

413
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:10,620
He framed us for colluding with the British and American forces.

414
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:13,620
He also framed Dr. Edward for being a spy in the British military.

415
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:15,620
Sasaki, we met him in Shanghai.

416
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:17,620
It was a treason. It's ridiculous.

417
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:20,620
General Sasaki has been a great worker for many years.

418
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:24,620
How could he allow such a thing to happen?

419
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:27,620
The military has long been the world of the Shaozhang Sect.

420
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:29,620
They are just using their hands to bully us.

421
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:30,620
The Eastern Courtyard has no one.

422
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:34,620
The Shaozhang Sect

423
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:36,620
The Shaozhang Sect

424
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:38,620
The Shaozhang Sect

425
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:40,620
The Shaozhang Sect

426
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:42,620
The Shaozhang Sect

427
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:44,620
The Shaozhang Sect

428
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:46,620
The Shaozhang Sect

429
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:48,620
The Shaozhang Sect

430
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,620
The Shaozhang Sect

431
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:52,620
The Shaozhang Sect

432
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:54,620
The Shaozhang Sect

433
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:56,620
The Shaozhang Sect

434
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:58,620
The Shaozhang Sect

435
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:00,620
The Shaozhang Sect

436
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:02,620
The Shaozhang Sect

437
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:05,620
Sasaki, find the place where the war spirit is.

438
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:08,620
And tell everyone to gather.

439
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:10,620
Yes, sir.

440
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:25,620
Call the doctor.

441
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:26,620
Yes, sir.

442
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:29,620
Doctor! Doctor!

443
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:31,620
Doctor!

444
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:01,620
Survival

445
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:03,620
or destruction

446
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:08,620
are both questions.

447
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:28,620
Father, don't worry.

448
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:31,620
Even without Dr. Edward,

449
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:34,620
I will call more doctors from England.

450
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:43,620
Joseph,

451
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:45,620
my uncle wants to see you.

452
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:54,620
I'm so glad

453
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:56,620
you're awake.

454
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:01,620
What are you doing here?

455
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:14,620
What are you doing here?

456
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:31,620
The secret research of the royal government

457
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:33,620
is in his hands.

458
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:37,620
He is

459
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:40,620
not Joseph.

460
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:42,620
At that time,

461
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:44,620
I invited Joseph

462
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:47,620
to the General Office of the Secret Service of the Kanto Army.

463
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:49,620
But

464
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:53,620
he didn't show any interest at all.

465
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:57,620
He showed interest in taking command

466
00:32:57,620 --> 00:33:00,620
of the Kanto Army.

467
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:07,620
You are not Joseph.

468
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:12,620
Who are you?

469
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:20,620
Perhaps you don't remember me.

470
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:22,620
But

471
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:24,620
you should know

472
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:26,620
this photo.

473
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:30,620
This is a photo

474
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:32,620
of him with you.

475
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:54,620
This photo

476
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:57,620
you took at that time,

477
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:59,620
right?

478
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:03,620
Yes.

479
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:05,620
You used the camera

480
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:07,620
for the first time,

481
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:10,620
didn't you?

482
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:12,620
Yes.

483
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:14,620
At that time,

484
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:17,620
I failed to take photos many times

485
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:20,620
and wasted a lot of films.

486
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:22,620
It's all right.

487
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:24,620
You did it nicely.

488
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:54,620
You are Joseph.

489
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:56,620
You can't remember this photo.

490
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:58,620
Who are you?

491
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:01,620
Take them away.

492
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:03,620
Take them away.

493
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:05,620
Take them away.

494
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:07,620
Take them away.

495
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:12,620
Father, are you all right?

496
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:16,620
Doctor, please.

497
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:18,620
Please.

498
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:20,620
Please.

499
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:22,620
Doctor.

500
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:36,620
His pulse is rising.

501
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:39,620
He may have a brain hemorrhage.

502
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:41,620
We will do an emergency treatment.

503
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:44,620
Father.

504
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:47,620
Father.

505
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:53,620
Take care of them.

506
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:55,620
Yes.

507
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:09,620
The stronghold he gave us

508
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:11,620
doesn't look fake.

509
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:16,620
But you have to give me some time

510
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:18,620
to find someone to verify.

511
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:19,620
Since it's Tang Bin Zhuang,

512
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:20,620
it must be fake.

513
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:22,620
I'll bring him in.

514
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:24,620
Come on.

515
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:27,620
You won't leave anyone after the verification.

516
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:28,620
Is that what you mean?

517
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:30,620
Or Chongqing?

518
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:39,620
You can get information

519
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:41,620
and catch the murderer

520
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:43,620
who blew up Shanghai Station.

521
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:45,620
But do you mean me

522
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,620
or the above?

523
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:50,620
I think

524
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:52,620
no matter who it is,

525
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:53,620
the dean won't

526
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:55,620
give up on a person

527
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:57,620
who's a bit of a troublemaker.

528
00:36:57,620 --> 00:36:59,620
Doctor.

529
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:05,620
You've grown up.

530
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:08,620
You're right.

531
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:10,620
Everyone has a special position

532
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:12,620
in the Liangni Academy.

533
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:20,620
I'll be waiting.

534
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:40,620
It's settled.

535
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:42,620
You may go in.

536
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:45,620
Young Master.

537
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:49,620
I know this is the traffic jam in the prairie.

538
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:52,620
I'm doing you a favor.

539
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:53,620
But you can't

540
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:55,620
put me in the pit.

541
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:04,620
Well,

542
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:06,620
if you have any concerns,

543
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:08,620
we'll go back.

544
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:17,620
I'm 100%

545
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:19,620
in your shoes.

546
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:21,620
I chose this road myself.

547
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:23,620
I'm lucky to have you

548
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:25,620
with me.

549
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:27,620
It's my honor.

550
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:47,620
I'm sorry.

551
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:06,620
What else do you want to say?

552
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:08,620
I've told you everything.

553
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:10,620
Maekong Ming.

554
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:12,620
I was born and raised

555
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:14,620
in the Dongyuan Temple.

556
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:16,620
Get off me!

557
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:18,620
Fine.

558
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:20,620
Continue with your show.

559
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:22,620
You haven't had enough.

560
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:32,620
Are you okay?

561
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:37,620
I can see it now.

562
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:40,620
It seems that

563
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:42,620
you're a couple.

564
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:44,620
At least,

565
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:46,620
you didn't lie to me.

566
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:50,620
But you did a good job.

567
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:53,620
You look just like Joseph.

568
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:58,620
It seems that

569
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:00,620
someone came to you with a lot of thought.

570
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:04,620
It's not someone else.

571
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:06,620
I came here myself.

572
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:08,620
Shut up!

573
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:09,620
What are you talking about?

574
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:11,620
My name is Ding Yi.

575
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:13,620
I'm an actor from the Chaozheng Group.

576
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:15,620
Lui Yue Se came to me

577
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:17,800
because he was invited to Shanghai by the

578
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,620
great-grandfather.

579
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:21,620
He was afraid that the Shanghai fans

580
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:23,620
would assassinate him.

581
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:25,620
So he asked me to be his bodyguard.

582
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:35,620
The small is the great.

583
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:37,620
The small is the great.

584
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:39,620
What Joseph will do

585
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:41,620
is not his own business.

586
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:43,620
What about him?

587
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:47,620
I killed him.

588
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:51,620
And then you became him.

589
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:53,620
Why?

590
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:55,620
Because the people of Zuo Zuo Mu

591
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:57,620
killed my sister, Zhu Hong Yu!

592
00:40:57,620 --> 00:40:59,620
But the heavens have spoken.

593
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:01,620
Lui Yue Se found me

594
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:03,620
to be his bodyguard.

595
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:05,620
This is the will of the heavens.

596
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:07,620
So I will avenge my sister.

597
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:11,620
Including Lui Yue Se's wife.

598
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:13,620
As long as it's Zuo Zuo Mu's wife,

599
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:15,620
I won't let anyone hurt me!

600
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:21,620
What about him?

601
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:23,620
He is the head of our group.

602
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:25,620
He is also

603
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:27,620
my husband.

604
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:31,620
That's right. Without this jiaoji flower,

605
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:33,620
you can't pretend to be an Englishman.

606
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:35,620
You can fool so many people.

607
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:37,620
I'm sorry.

608
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:39,620
I'm sorry.

609
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:41,620
I'm sorry.

610
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:49,620
It seems

611
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:51,620
what you said is true.

612
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:03,620
But you used the four families of Dong Yuan

613
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:05,620
to stir up the internal unity of the military.

614
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:07,620
You are still alive.

615
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:09,620
You are the shame of the four families of Dong Yuan.

616
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:11,620
And the shame of the Imperial Army.

617
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:13,620
I won't let this mistake

618
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:15,620
continue!

619
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:17,620
Give it to me.

620
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:19,620
Give it to me.

621
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:25,620
Wait!

622
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:27,620
Give it back to me!

623
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:29,620
I know

624
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:31,620
I should be careful.

625
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:33,620
But I'm not.

626
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:35,620
I'm useful to you.

627
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:39,620
Zuo Zuo Mu, he sent a telegram

628
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:41,620
and wrote a letter to the Imperial Army.

629
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:43,620
He poisoned Dr. Ai Dao Hua.

630
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:45,620
These are all the facts you believed.

631
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:47,620
I don't have the ability to fake him.

632
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:49,620
You only have one gun.

633
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:51,620
I can kill him for you.

634
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:53,620
I can protect the dignity of the four families of Dong Yuan.

635
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:55,620
Ding Yi!

636
00:42:57,620 --> 00:42:59,620
Give a liar a gun.

637
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:01,620
I'm sorry.

638
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:03,620
I'm not that stupid.

639
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:05,620
You must believe me.

640
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:07,620
Zuo Zuo Mu doesn't know I can see him.

641
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:09,620
So, only me,

642
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:11,620
only me,

643
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:13,620
he won't have any defense.

644
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:15,620
Only then can I kill him.

645
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:17,620
I'm begging you.

646
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:19,620
I'm begging you.

647
00:43:19,620 --> 00:43:21,620
I'll avenge my sister.

648
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:23,620
I'll die as I wish.

649
00:43:23,620 --> 00:43:25,620
But I have only one request.

650
00:43:25,620 --> 00:43:27,620
Let go of my lover.

651
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:29,620
Zuo Zuo Mu, you can't come back.

652
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:31,620
Shut up!

653
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:47,620
I didn't want to come back.

654
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:51,620
I've already given you my life.

655
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:53,620
Hurry up and go back.

656
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:55,620
Father!

657
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:57,620
Take care of her!

658
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:28,620
Fire is a poisonous thing.

659
00:44:28,620 --> 00:44:32,620
It's broken and it's dragging the temperature.

660
00:44:33,620 --> 00:44:35,620
Red is through the eyes.

661
00:44:35,620 --> 00:44:39,620
It's swaying in the weak and helplessness.

662
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:42,620
Flowers are rising.

663
00:44:42,620 --> 00:44:46,620
The fierce body is turned into mud.

664
00:44:47,620 --> 00:44:49,620
When the sun rises,

665
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:53,620
the first light will light up my way.

666
00:44:53,620 --> 00:44:56,620
The house is a maze.

667
00:44:56,620 --> 00:45:00,620
There is no direction and no way out.

668
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:03,620
The pain in the eyes.

669
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:07,620
The person who made the fake play is not clear.

670
00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:11,620
Where is the wind going?

671
00:45:11,620 --> 00:45:13,620
Whose window is shaking?

672
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:15,620
The sound of the flute.

673
00:45:15,620 --> 00:45:18,620
The heart is thinking.

674
00:45:18,620 --> 00:45:20,620
It's either you or me.

675
00:45:20,620 --> 00:45:23,620
It's either you or me.

676
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:26,620
It's watching.

677
00:45:26,620 --> 00:45:30,620
The night is long.

678
00:45:30,620 --> 00:45:33,620
Tears are floating.

679
00:45:33,620 --> 00:45:37,620
A drop of injury.

680
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:40,620
It's watching.

681
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:44,620
The shadow is wandering.

682
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:47,620
The color is dark.

683
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:51,620
It's also bright when I look back.

684
00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:55,620
It's watching.

685
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:59,620
The night is long.

686
00:45:59,620 --> 00:46:02,620
Tears are floating.

687
00:46:02,620 --> 00:46:06,620
A drop of injury.

688
00:46:06,620 --> 00:46:09,620
It's watching.

689
00:46:09,620 --> 00:46:13,620
The shadow is wandering.

690
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:16,620
The color is dark.

691
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:20,620
It's also bright when I look back.

692
00:46:20,620 --> 00:46:23,620
The shadow is dark.

693
00:46:23,620 --> 00:46:29,620
It's also bright when I look back.
