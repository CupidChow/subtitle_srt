Mr. Shen, I have something to ask you.

77
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,000
How did you get the code?

78
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
How did you design the code?

79
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I'm afraid only you guys know.

80
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Mr. Da asked me.

81
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Isn't it the original?

82
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I don't know.

83
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
One more thing.

84
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:56,000
How did the British get the information?

85
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
My relationship with the British

86
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
hasn't reached the point where they can tell me the source of the information.

87
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Mr. Shen, you are a famous person in Shanghai.

88
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,000
British, American, Chinese.

89
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Everyone is looking at you.

90
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I'm sure you have a better point than anyone else.

91
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
You came to see me today

92
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
because you have something in mind.

93
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,000
You don't give me information that is not yet clear.

94
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Right?

95
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Please analyze it.

96
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Please analyze it.

97
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:09,000

99
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Mr. Da, if you really want to investigate,

100
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
please enter from here.

101
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I will end it here.

102
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I will read the script.

103
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I will go home and read the script.

104
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Goodbye.

105
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Excuse me.

106
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Biyun, here.

107
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I treat you as a friend. What do you mean?

108
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
You are just acting.

109
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Why are you so angry?

110
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
You help me, Shen Biyun. Who do you think you are?

111
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Shen Biyun, you are now a Japanese support.

112
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
What loss do you have?

113
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Today, a communist group came to your troupe.

114
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Such a big thing.

115
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:10,360
If it weren't for the Wutian

116
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
You know, when I was young,

117
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I participated in the student activities of the Communist Party.

118
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I was so angry that I gave her news every day.

119
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I said she was a traitor who came from the other side.

120
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I have never been wronged like this in my whole life.

121
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Today's situation,

122
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
don't blame me.

123
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I will tell the government to move the bridge

124
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
and build the mountain.

125
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
She promised me

126
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
she would send me back to Shanghai from Suzhou.

127
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Then she came back

128
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
and told me that she couldn't bear it.

129
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
She told me that she had no time.

130
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
She told me that she was blown out of the wind.

131
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
She was blown out of the wind.

132
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
She was shot by Chongqing.

133
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
She was killed.

134
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Biyun, Biyun, Biyun.

135
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
You have known me for so many years, right?

136
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
You are not good at saving people.

137
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Biyun, I was wrong.

138
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Biyun, please help me.

139
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I was wrong.

140
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Biyun.

141
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Enough.

142
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
What's the point of saying this now?

143
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Please help me.

144
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Didn't she say that

145
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
she had no time

146
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
and couldn't come back?

147
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
If someone is gone,

148
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
what?

149
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
She will have the control.

150
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Is that what you mean?

151
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
My Lord.

152
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
My Lord.

153
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
My Lord.

154
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Don't ask anything.

155
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Don't say anything.

156
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Just help me

157
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
send her back to the county.

158
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Okay?

159
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Where is the paper?

160
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Listen to me.

161
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Take it.

162
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Go to Fengjie Road.

163
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
You will find it there.

164
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Okay.

165
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Okay.

166
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Take the paper.

167
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I will go with you.

168
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Don't worry.

169
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Don't worry.

170
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Take care.

171
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
What are you afraid of?

172
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Don't come over.

173
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Are you going to

174
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
hand me over to the county?

175
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Where are we?

176
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Don't come over.

177
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
We are at the dock.

178
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I am going to send you out

179
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
to Hong Kong.

180
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Don't lie to me.

181
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Tell me.

182
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
What did that man do?

183
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
He is our own man.

184
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
You will leave by his boat tonight.

185
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Yes.

186
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
You are all our own people.

187
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
You have no good people.

188
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
You took me to exchange money.

189
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
You took me to exchange money.

190
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
You must take me back

191
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
and hand me over to your teacher.

192
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Then he will take me down

193
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
and finish your

194
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
dirty and despicable act.

195
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Are you afraid of this?

196
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
If I really want to poison you,

197
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
can you still see

198
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
what you just saw?

199
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Look.

200
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
We are at the dock.

201
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Behind that house

202
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
is the boat you are going to take tonight.

203
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I promised you

204
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I would keep my word.

205
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Shhh.

206
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
No.

207
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
You can't go now.

208
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
The people who trust the group

209
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
are never going to know.

210
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I can't just let them go.

211
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
But, senior.

212
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I want to stay and take revenge.

213
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I can't let Hong Yu die in vain.

214
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I want to stay by the Japanese

215
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
and destroy them!

216
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Calm down, calm down. Listen to me, okay?

217
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,200
I know you want to take revenge.

218
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,800
But think about it. What can you do when you go back?

219
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,200
You can't do anything.

220
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,800
And we've already discussed it.

221
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,000
You have to go to Hong Kong.

222
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,800
Go to Hong Kong and meet your mother.

223
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:38,400
Understand?

224
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,400
I'm not going!

225
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,600
I want to take revenge! I want to kill Huang Yiming!

226
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,600
You...

227
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,200
Are you here?

228
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,200
Yes.

229
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,600
Our men are watching us.

230
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,800
Lead the way.

231
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,800
Everyone, catch them alive!

232
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,400
Let's go.

233
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:34,800
Hurry!

234
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,000
Let's go!

235
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,800
Let's go!

236
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Let's go!

237
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,800
Let's go!

238
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,800
Let's go!

239
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,200
Let's go down!

240
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,200
Let's go!

241
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,200
Let's go! You go first!

242
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,400
You go first!

243
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,200
Let's go!

244
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:33,600
No!

245
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,600
Let's go!

246
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,200
Hurry up!

247
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,000
Let's go!

248
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,200
You go first!

249
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:47,800
Are you okay?

250
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,000
Come down!

251
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Hurry!

252
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,400
Run! Someone's coming!

253
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,200
Hurry!

254
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,800
I'll cover you!

255
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,000
Let's go together!

256
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,200
This way! Hurry!

257
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:20,800
Hurry up!

258
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,800
Hurry!

259
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,800
Run!

260
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,800
Hurry!

261
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,800
Get on the boat!

262
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,800
Run!

263
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:26,800
Get on the boat!

264
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,800
Run!

265
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:28,800
That way!

266
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:29,800
Hurry!

267
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,800
I'm not going!

268
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:40,800
I'm not going!

269
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:41,800
Gu Xiaoshan!

270
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:42,800
Get on the boat!

271
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,800
I'm not going!

272
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:45,800
Let me go!

273
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:46,800
Let me go!

274
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:47,800
I'm not going!

275
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:48,800
I'm not going!

276
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:49,800
I'm not going!

277
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,800
Let me go!

278
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:51,800
Get on the boat first!

279
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,800
Gu Xiaoshan!

280
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:03,800
Gu Xiaoshan!

281
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:04,800
Get on the boat!

282
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,800
Gu Xiaoshan!

283
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:06,800
Go!

284
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,800
Get on the boat!

285
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,800
Get on the boat first!

286
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:10,800
Hurry!

287
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,800
Why aren't you leaving?

288
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:14,800
We're going together!

289
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:18,800
Go!

290
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,800
Go!

291
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,800
Go!

292
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:28,800
Gu Xiaoshan!

293
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,800
Get on the boat!

294
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:30,800
Get on the boat!

295
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:31,800
You go first!

296
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,800
There are too many people!

297
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,800
If we go together, we'll die!

298
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,800
I'll go to Hong Kong to find you!

299
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,800
No!

300
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:41,800
Hong Yu died because I wanted to go!

301
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,800
If you don't come up, I won't go!

302
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,800
We'll all die together!

303
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,800
Sir!

304
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:48,800
You go first!

305
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:51,800
Old Li!

306
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,800
Hurry and let him go!

307
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,800
Hurry and take him to the protection house!

308
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,800
If you don't go, I'll shoot!

309
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:57,800
Hurry and go!

310
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,800
Go!

311
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,800
Gu Xiaoshan!

312
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:05,800
Hurry!

313
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,800
Go!

314
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,800
Gu Xiaoshan!

315
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,800
I lied to you about the White Tiger!

316
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,800
There's nothing going on in the White Tiger!

317
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,800
I was looking for a copy of the newspaper!

318
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,800
I was looking for a recording of the broadcast!

319
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,800
I'm a bastard!

320
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,800
Attention!

321
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:29,800
Recently, the Japanese army is attacking the north of the capital of South Korea.

322
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,800
The three Chinese armies are about to invade the White Tiger.

323
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,800
The White Tiger...

324
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:36,800
The White Tiger is attacking!

325
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,800
So the most important thing now

326
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,800
is to change the enemy's battle code.

327
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,800
Only then can we understand the enemy's battle plan

328
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,800
and change the situation.

329
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,800
Only then can you save your mother.

330
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,800
I'm not a good person!

331
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,800
Dieyi!

332
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,800
All of you, stay safe!

333
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,800
I'm sorry!

334
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,800
Go!

335
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,800
Gu Xiaolang!

336
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,800
I'm a bastard!

337
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,800
Everyone, get back!

338
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,800
Don't shoot.

339
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,800
The person you're going to catch has already escaped.

340
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:08,800
Go!

341
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:10,800
Go!

342
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:19,800
Move aside!

343
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:21,800
Move aside!

344
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:31,800
Where is he?

345
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:33,800
Where is he?

346
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:34,800
Where is he?

347
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,800
He ran away.

348
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:48,800
I've been working for nothing!

349
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,800
No need.

350
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:56,800
You'll regret this.

351
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:58,800
You're playing tricks on me?

352
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,800
I really don't want to kill you if you think I'm a bastard!

353
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,800
I'll go and kill you!

354
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,800
Don't shoot.

355
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,800
Don't shoot.

356
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,800
You're a bastard!

357
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:18,800
Stop!

358
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:24,800
Move aside!

359
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:32,800
Move aside!

360
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,800
If you want money, give it to me.

361
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,800
Now, the whole Shanghai Bund

362
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,800
is worth more than me.

363
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:57,800
Come here.

364
00:23:58,800 --> 00:23:59,800
My money.

365
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:02,800
My money.

366
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:32,800
Gu Xiaolang.

367
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,800
What do you want to talk about?

368
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,800
I want to talk business with you.

369
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,800
Go to the military first.

370
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,800
Or your brother-in-law?

371
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:49,800
The Japanese want their good brand.

372
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,800
The password expert, Johnson Lee.

373
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:56,800
I'm sorry.

374
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:57,800
I'm sorry.

375
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:58,800
I'm sorry.

376
00:24:58,800 --> 00:24:59,800
I'm sorry.

377
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:03,800
Look at this bastard.

378
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,800
He's so stubborn.

379
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,800
As long as the Japanese aren't blind,

380
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:10,800
they'll recognize him as a fake.

381
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,800
If I send him to the military,

382
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:15,800
the Japanese will shoot him to death.

383
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:18,800
I'll have to burn him in the fire.

384
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,800
How much did the Japanese pay you?

385
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:25,800
Why are you asking?

386
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,800
How much?

387
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,800
Five pieces of yellow croaker.

388
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,800
I said, Mr. Lee, Mr. Lee.

389
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,800
You're smoking a lot.

390
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:42,800
You're ruining your own mind.

391
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,800
You're smart.

392
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,800
You're smart because of this bastard.

393
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:52,800
You got the military and the Japanese.

394
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:55,800
You're not a good chief.

395
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:56,800
Why do you have to do this?

396
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:59,800
I think you're way worse than me.

397
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:04,800
Mr. Lee, he's not a bastard.

398
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:09,800
He's the one you've been talking about.

399
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:16,800
I told you to use him to make money.

400
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,800
Do you believe me?

401
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:20,800
Double?

402
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,800
Double.

403
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,800
If I can really do double,

404
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:28,800
I'll admit I'm a smart bastard.

405
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,800
You're not going to the military.

406
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,800
It's because you've been missing

407
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:37,800
for a long time.

408
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,800
You can't explain the time.

409
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,800
So I'm afraid the Japanese won't pay you.

410
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,800
Can you stop talking nonsense?

411
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,800
Okay.

412
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,800
Say something useful.

413
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,800
Okay, whatever.

414
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,800
Say whatever you want.

415
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:02,800
Please say okay.

416
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,800
I have an idea for you.

417
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,800
What else can you think of?

418
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:17,800
Are you going to swim again?

419
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,800
Or jump into the water?

420
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:23,800
I'm going to swim all over the sky.

421
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:26,800
What are you talking about?

422
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,800
As long as you can prove that

423
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,800
Li Yue-se was caught by the police

424
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:35,800
these two days,

425
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:38,800
we have no choice but to disappear.

426
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:39,800
Then you and Detective Lee

427
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:42,800
will be back together with the Japanese.

428
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:43,800
Right?

429
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,800
Think about it.

430
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:53,800
Chu Jian-ge.

431
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,800
Good idea.

432
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,800
Detective Lee.

433
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,800
Come in.

434
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,800
Okay.

435
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,800
You have to go.

436
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,800
Deal.

437
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,800
Deal.

438
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,800
Let's go.

439
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,800
Okay.

440
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,800
Hurry up.

441
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,800
Follow me.

442
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,800
Don't waste my time.

443
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,800
Hurry up.

444
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,340
It's really a

445
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:24,800
good idea.

446
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:25,800
Yes.

447
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:28,800
This detective Lee was a big star.

448
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,800
I thought he was a big hit.

449
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,800
I didn't expect him to be so popular.

450
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,800
Listen,

451
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,800
this woman is just a weed.

452
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,800
She has no money to rely on.

453
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,800
She's a big jerk.

454
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,800
What are you talking about?

455
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,800
I'm talking about you.

456
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,800
Wait for me.

457
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,800
I'm not a jerk.

458
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,800
You're the traitors.

459
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,800
You're the police.

460
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:53,800
Wait.

461
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,800
I'm going to kill you.

462
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,800
Police.

463
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,800
Let go.

464
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,800
Let go.

465
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,800
Let go.

466
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,800
I'm sorry, sir.

467
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,800
He's been locked up for too long.

468
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:08,800
He's been stimulated.

469
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:09,800
Stimulated?

470
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,800
He doesn't even look at him.

471
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,800
Who's going to be the one to be stimulated?

472
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,800
Let's go.

473
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,800
I'm sorry.

474
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,800
Get lost.

475
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,800
Get lost.

476
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,800
Yes.

477
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,800
Thank you.

478
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,800
Thank you.

479
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,800
Miss Shen,

480
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,800
you heard it, right?

481
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:37,800
We've released the people you arrested.

482
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,800
What do you think about

483
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,800
the case of the drug lord?

484
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:46,800
Miss Ye and I have been friends for years.

485
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,800
She asked me to help

486
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,800
with the peace of China and Japan.

487
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:53,800
She's been doing everything she could.

488
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:56,800
I don't like fighting.

489
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:59,800
I have no reason to refuse.

490
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,800
Besides,

491
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,800
you've even published a newspaper.

492
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,800
If I refuse,

493
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,800
in the eyes of others,

494
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,800
it would be a joke.

495
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,800
How did the British

496
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,800
kill the people

497
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,800
around Miss Shen?

498
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,800
People need friends.

499
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,800
Chief, you should understand what I mean.

500
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,800
You're a beautiful

501
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,800
and smart woman.

502
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,800
I'm sorry.

503
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,800
Chief Sasaki is back.

504
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,800
Miss Shen wants to see you.

505
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,800
She's back.

506
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,800
She wants you to go.

507
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,800
Oh, right.

508
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,800
My car broke down today.

509
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,800
Since we're friends,

510
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,800
could you give me a ride?

511
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,800
Sure.

512
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,800
Send Miss Shen

513
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,800
to the police station.

514
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,800
Yes, sir.

515
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,800
Chief, please.

516
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,800
Stop.

517
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,800
Stop.

518
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,800
Stop.

519
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,800
Stop.

520
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,800
I'll get off here.

521
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,800
Thank you, Captain Lin.

522
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,800
I'll get off here.

523
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,800
This newspaper

524
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,800
is so unclear.

525
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,800
How could Miss Shen

526
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,800
act as Asia's God of War?

527
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,800
Yes.

528
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,800
I've written the declaration.

529
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,800
I'll report it

530
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,800
when Miss Shen comes back.

531
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,800
They'll have to report it

532
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,800
and apologize.

533
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,800
We can't just let it go.

534
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,800
We can't.

535
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,800
Is Miss Shen really a traitor?

536
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,800
What are you talking about?

537
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,800
Miss Shen has been in the troupe for so long.

538
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,800
Don't you know who she is?

539
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,800
You don't know her.

540
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,800
How could you say that?

541
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,800
What are you waiting for?

542
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,800
Miss Shen,

543
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,800
the Chinese newspaper is so shameless.

544
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,800
They just want to pull you down

545
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,800
with a picture of you.

546
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,800
I've written the declaration.

547
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,800
They say you were cheated.

548
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,800
No need.

549
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,800
I'm willing to do it.

550
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,800
No way.

551
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,800
Miss Shen,

552
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,800
I know you have your reasons.

553
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,800
You told us, right?

554
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,800
We all believe you.

555
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,800
At worst,

556
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,800
we'll just go in there.

557
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,800
Yes.

558
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,800
Let's do it together.

559
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,800
Yes.

560
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,800
Together?

561
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,800
Who will do it with you?

562
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,800
If it weren't for you,

563
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,800
I wouldn't have caused so much trouble.

564
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,800
Be careful from now on.

565
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,800
Don't be like Zhu Hongyu.

566
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,800
Hongyu, she...

567
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,800
I know you have your reasons.

568
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,800
What's wrong with your reasons?

569
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,800
How can you live without them?

570
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:31,120
Tent-O-M helfen hat ounceAT

571
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,800
Without me,

572
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,800
you might be

573
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:40,800
still being shot by the revolvers.

574
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,800
Now that the British people are gone,

575
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,800
why don't you kids come down

576
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,300
and fight the Japanese on Zuye street.

577
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,800
Who are we?

578
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,800
We're actors.

579
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:02,800
The actor's job is acting!

580
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,800
The play is fake.

581
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,800
The money sold is real.

582
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:10,800
What does it have to do with us?

583
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,800
What does it have to do with you?

584
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:18,800
They hit them.

585
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,800
We act our own way!

586
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:25,800
Now the women in the hunting industry are not being treated as real women.

587
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:29,800
Live a good life for me.

588
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:34,800
Don't be a coward.

589
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,800
If the Changsheng Group serves the Japanese,

590
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:52,800
I will starve to death and never eat rice!

591
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,800
Yes, I will not eat either!

592
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:58,800
You are a disgrace to the Changsheng Group!

593
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:02,800
The play is fake.

594
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:07,800
If you want to do it, do it. If you don't, get lost!

595
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,800
I will not spare you a cent.

596
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:15,800
No wonder he had no face to show off with the Japanese chief.

597
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,800
I feel something is wrong.

598
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,800
This is your real face.

599
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:23,800
You blinded all of us and acted with him for so long.

600
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,800
He is a traitor!

601
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,800
Say it again!

602
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,800
Say it again!

603
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,800
You are a traitor!

604
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,800
You are a traitor!

605
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,800
If I dare to do something again,

606
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:57,800
don't blame me for not showing my face.

607
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,800
Get lost!

608
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,800
You are a traitor!

609
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,800
You are a traitor!

610
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,800
Go away!

611
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,800
Go away!

612
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:30,800
Go away!

613
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:35,800
Please!

614
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:41,800
This is our home! Where are we going?

615
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:54,800
Go away!

616
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:24,800
Miss Xian, I know you are in there.

617
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:28,800
I also know that you and the Japanese are not on the same side.

618
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,800
You must have some kind of unanswered question in your mind.

619
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:34,800
Just tell me the truth.

620
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:39,800
Are you and Hongyu a Communist?

621
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:46,800
Whether or not Hongyu is a Communist has nothing to do with me.

622
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,800
Don't ask me such a boring question again.

623
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,800
Long'er, let's go.

624
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,800
Old man,

625
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,800
I am a man of the world.

626
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,800
I have very sharp eyes.

627
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:03,800
So I can see that you have your own plan.

628
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:09,800
I have been working hard in the troupe for so long.

629
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:12,800
I hope to gain your trust.

630
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,800
I hope one day,

631
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,800
I can get your approval

632
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:20,800
and help you with your work.

633
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,800
But one night,

634
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:27,800
Hongyu died and became a Communist.

635
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,800
You also gave up your life.

636
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,800
I am like a fool. I know nothing.

637
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:40,800
Long'er, you must know that the more you know, the more dangerous it is.

638
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,800
Why can I know that?

639
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,800
He...

640
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,800
He is a little bit more powerful than me.

641
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:51,800
Hongyu is not afraid of sacrifice. So is my Long'er.

642
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:54,800
Long'er, let's go. I have made it up for you.

643
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:59,800
I am not going, old man. This is my home. I am not going.

644
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:02,800
I am not going.

645
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,800
This troupe

646
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,800
is the hard work you have done for half of your life.

647
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,800
You and I, we are all gone. The troupe is gone.

648
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:16,800
You are alone, and you are being scolded by your family.

649
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:20,800
You don't want to tell me the truth?

650
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:26,800
You saved my Long'er.

651
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:31,800
Even if you are a Communist, I will not betray you.

652
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:36,800
Just tell me the truth. Just one word.

653
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,800
I will believe it if you tell me the truth.

654
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:42,800
You want to find a Communist to find somewhere else?

655
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,800
A Zhu Hongyu

656
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:50,800
has caused us so much harm.

657
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,800
Get lost!

658
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,800
This...

659
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,800
I never thought that

660
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:14,800
after so much effort,

661
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:18,800
I would not even get an answer.

662
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:25,800
Long'er, what are you doing?

663
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,800
Long'er,

664
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,800
these three heads

665
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:00,800
are the life-saving grace you gave me.

666
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,800
As for the answer,

667
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:08,800
I will find it myself.

668
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,800
Long'er!

669
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:41,800
Fire is a poison.

670
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:45,800
The broken辣 is the temperature.

671
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:48,800
Red is through the eyes.

672
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:52,800
It is swaying in that weak and helplessness.

673
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:55,800
Flowers bloom and fall.

674
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:59,800
The strong body turns into mud.

675
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:02,800
When the sun rises,

676
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:06,800
the first light will dance for me.

677
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:10,800
The house is a maze.

678
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:14,800
There is no direction and no way out.

679
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:17,800
In the pain of the night,

680
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:21,800
the people in the house are not clear.

681
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:24,800
Where is the wind going?

682
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:28,800
Whose window is shaking?

683
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:31,800
The heart is thinking,

684
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:35,800
maybe you, maybe I am feeling.

685
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:42,800
It is looking at the vast night.

686
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:46,800
Tears are flowing.

687
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:49,800
A group of wounded people.

688
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:56,800
It is looking at the shadow.

689
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:59,800
The night falls.

690
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:04,800
Looking back, it is heaven.

691
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:08,800
The house is a maze.

692
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:12,800
There is no direction and no way out.

693
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:15,800
In the pain of the night,

694
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:19,800
the people in the house are not clear.

695
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:22,800
Where is the wind going?

696
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:25,800
Whose window is shaking?

697
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:28,800
The heart is thinking,

698
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:32,800
maybe you, maybe I am feeling.

699
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:35,800
The house is a maze.

700
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:39,800
There is no direction and no way out.

701
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:42,800
In the pain of the night,

702
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:45,800
the people in the house are not clear.

703
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:48,800
Where is the wind going?

704
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:51,800
Whose window is shaking?

705
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:54,800
The heart is thinking,

706
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:58,800
maybe you, maybe I am feeling.

707
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:01,800
It is looking at the vast night.
