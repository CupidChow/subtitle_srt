1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,800
Halo 4

2
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The End

3
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Mr. Shen

4
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Who are you?

5
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Mr. Shen, it's me.

6
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Yaoshan

7
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Mr. Shen, I'm here.

8
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Gu Yaoshan, the chief of the Secret Service, has been in the office for a thousand years.

9
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Why is Gu Yaoshan back?

10
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Where is Chief Wu of the Secret Service?

11
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Chief Wu has fled, so the chief is in a hurry to change the code of the secret service.

12
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
He is just a sicko.

13
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Contact all the staff of the secret service and tell them in person that the original frequency, the code of the secret service and the time of the release are all out.

14
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I will not use a new network plan.

15
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I will never use a code that the Communist Party has acquired.

16
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
But our action team is scattered in the city.

17
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
It will take two or three days to contact all the staff in person.

18
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Then you go quickly.

19
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Yes.

20
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
The chief is not here. You go in and wait.

21
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Yes.

22
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Chief Wu of the Secret Service

23
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Coach Ding

24
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
What are you smelling?

25
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
The password of the password is much more complicated than the usual single-page phone code.

26
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
If it is not the most important secret, they will not easily try such a troublesome encryption method.

27
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:12,080
So the

28
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
When we were in the hospital, he told me that he was still studying the password of the secret service.

29
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Now this code is so fast that it is used by the head.

30
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
It must be his research result.

31
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:39,000
The password of the secret service, you know, there is no way to decode it in a short time.

32
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
So the only way now is to try to contact Gu Yangshan.

33
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
He has been in contact with us for four years.

34
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
He has been trapped in Nanjing for research.

35
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
How do you contact him?

36
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
But I don't believe it.

37
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Without Gu Yangshan's guidance, the secret source of the secret service of the People's Island Security Bureau can find the password of the secret service.

38
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
He must be back.

39
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Director Gu, the commander in chief Luofu said that it is a special situation.

40
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:28,000
If we can't find the right person, the clothes of this Gu Mansion can only be processed by us in the laundry shop outside.

41
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Please understand.

42
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Thank you.

43
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Thank you.

44
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Take care.

45
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Gu Yangshan

46
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Gu Yangshan

47
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Boss, two bowls of lamb skewers.

48
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Okay, sit down first. I'll pour you some tea.

49
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Here is the tea.

50
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Sorry, sorry.

51
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
There is a shop opposite. I'll talk to the boss.

52
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I'll take you to change clothes.

53
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Gu Yangshan

54
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
It's been a long time since he went to the White House.

55
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
This time, he went to your uncle.

56
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Why did you scold him?

57
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
We had a deal that we would meet in Yan'an.

58
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
But when the main force went to the West White Hill,

59
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I didn't see you.

60
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Do you think you should scold him?

61
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Mengjie

62
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Are you okay?

63
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I'm fine.

64
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
When I arrived in Yan'an, the main force was gone.

65
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Then I moved to the White Hill with Zhongyang.

66
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I was hoping to see my friends every day and come back to Shanghai to find you.

67
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,000
People say that the letter that Miss Meng wrote to him is much more than the letter I wrote to her.

68
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Every month, they ask how is the situation in Shanghai?

69
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Is there any news about you?

70
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
If you don't take her to Shanghai,

71
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I'm afraid my wife will be annoyed by her.

72
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
After He Ping, I can go to Beiping.

73
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Then I'll find a yard.

74
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Our two families will have a good time inside.

75
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Are you still playing with the hot water to change clothes?

76
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
That's the game I played in Yuying Pavilion.

77
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
It seems that there is nothing to improve these years.

78
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Then how about we visit the boss and ask the boss of the warehouse to catch up with us?

79
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Are you going to clear up now?

80
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Then no one will come to me.

81
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,000
When I first arrived in Nanjing, Comrade Xiao contacted me and arranged me to join the party.

82
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
But soon I lost contact with the organization.

83
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I have to practice.

84
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I have been trying to contact you for the past four years.

85
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
But I was grounded in Nanjing.

86
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
There is no way.

87
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Until I wait for the Central Plain to use this Liyue color code again,

88
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I found a chance to return to Shanghai.

89
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I have never been willing to maintain the situation.

90
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
So I have been doing one thing these years.

91
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Research Liyue color code.

92
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
How about it?

93
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Can you help me this time?

94
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
It's a big deal.

95
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
After the liberation, I will apply to the superior.

96
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I will give you a special job.

97
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I will teach everyone the principle of this code.

98
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
How do you know I want to teach after the peace?

99
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Because now I have to teach.

100
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Every time they ask me, I think about it.

101
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
It would be nice if Guiyang Mountain was here.

102
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Because he must love this.

103
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Good.

104
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Seriously, do you know where this code is used?

105
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I only know this code is used on a secret operation in Wuhan.

106
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
But all he uses are people outside the station.

107
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Only Cao Yanzhong and himself know the contents of the operation.

108
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
We haven't reached any other situation yet.

109
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
It doesn't matter.

110
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
We have been following his radio station for a long time.

111
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
There is a record of him sending packages in the last two months.

112
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I think with this, we will know what to do soon.

113
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Yes.

114
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
In the phone call just now,

115
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Commander Tang instructed the original plan is

116
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
to make Shanghai the first war's lamp.

117
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
The second war's Stalin's Gle.

118
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
If Shanghai can't hold it,

119
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
it will be taken down,

120
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
destroyed,

121
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
and destroyed.

122
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
The earth, the bomb,

123
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Shanghai.

124
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Our plan is to establish

125
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
the first war's lamp.

126
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
This is the initial arrangement of the earth plan.

127
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
You are all excellent talents chosen by Director Mao.

128
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I have already set up a bomb plan

129
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
at the Shanghai radio station,

130
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
at the dock, at the station, and so on.

131
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
TNT.

132
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
The first batch of explosives has 100,000 kilograms.

133
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,000
TNT is one-fifth of the bomb.

134
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
TNT is one-fifth of the bomb.

135
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
He wants to blow up Shanghai.

136
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
He wants to blow up Shanghai.

137
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
This Luo Han is really crazy.

138
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
He dares to say that

139
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
after he entered the city.

140
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I think everything is arranged.

141
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
That means half of Shanghai's public facilities

142
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
are tied to the bomb.

143
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Now we are confused.

144
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
It's too late to find those explosives.

145
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Besides,

146
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
all Luo Han uses are the former subordinates

147
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
that Mao Renfeng personally deployed.

148
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
They are all old and weak.

149
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
It's not easy to find.

150
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
It's too late to find.

151
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
The first stage of the war with Wu Song

152
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
is about to end.

153
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
The last headquarters are also on the line.

154
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
We don't know the number of their subordinates.

155
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Even if we get the list,

156
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
we can't find them all in such a short time.

157
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
We have to catch them.

158
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I have an idea.

159
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
When we were in Yan'an,

160
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
our instructor told us one thing.

161
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
After the fourth poison,

162
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
the central chief approved the suggestion of Zeng Xisheng.

163
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
He pretended to be a general and reported it.

164
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
He won the war for the southern subordinates.

165
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
It's the right of the Red Army to attack the people.

166
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
You mean we can use Li Yue's code

167
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
to pretend Luo Han to report to him?

168
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Come on.

169
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Liang.

170
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Come on.

171
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Listen.

172
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Why would someone send a telegram

173
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
at this time of the day?

174
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
This is the new radio station

175
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
that Chief Luo just applied for.

176
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
He told me not to use the policy.

177
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
New radio station?

178
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Didn't we give him

179
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
a special action radio station?

180
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I don't know about that.

181
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
He applied for a new radio station on the day you came.

182
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
He also said he would report it himself.

183
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
He doesn't need us to secretly send him a telegram.

184
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Chief Luo is so unruly now.

185
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
What code does he use

186
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
to secretly send a telegram?

187
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Does he use the telegram of the palace

188
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
or his own private code?

189
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Don't misunderstand.

190
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Chief Luo is definitely not that kind of person.

191
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
The codes he used

192
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
were all reported in the key room.

193
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
They were all sent by the flow.

194
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
All right.

195
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I don't have that misunderstanding.

196
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Don't worry.

197
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I've been friends with Chief Luo

198
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
for more than ten years.

199
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
All right. Go back and sleep.

200
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Yes.

201
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Hello.

202
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I'm looking for Ji Yaoyuan.

203
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Don't move.

204
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Chief Luo, why are you here?

205
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I heard that this Luofu War

206
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
has applied for a new radio station.

207
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
And the code of the telegram

208
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
is not in our secret place.

209
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
But in your base.

210
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I heard that

211
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
it's not in our secret place.

212
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
But in your base.

213
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Is that true?

214
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Yes.

215
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Yes.

216
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
All right.

217
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
It's getting out of hand.

218
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
He doesn't use the radio station and the code in the station.

219
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
He actually uses his own private code.

220
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Let me tell you.

221
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
This is a serious crisis.

222
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I suspect that he has a secret connection with the enemy.

223
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Where is your secret code?

224
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Hand it over.

225
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I want to get back the secret place.

226
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Chief Gu.

227
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
My job is to protect the code.

228
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
And then send it to Taiwan for the case.

229
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I don't care about anything else.

230
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
But you.

231
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
You called me out in the middle of the night.

232
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I'm afraid it's a serious crisis.

233
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Right?

234
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Well.

235
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Tomorrow.

236
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
We'll go to the station together.

237
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
And see how you react.

238
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
All right.

239
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
It's a little bit of a rule.

240
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Well.

241
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Tomorrow morning.

242
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I'm at the gate of the station office.

243
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I'll be waiting for you.

244
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Go back.

245
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Have a rest.

246
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I'm leaving, Chief Gu.

247
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Thank you.

248
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Thank you.

249
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Go.

250
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Go.

251
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Hello.

252
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Is this the West Bank?

253
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
The prescription you prescribed for me last time.

254
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I finished it.

255
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
My heart still doesn't feel well.

256
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Or I'll go again tomorrow morning.

257
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
You can check it for me.

258
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Something happened.

259
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Something happened.

260
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Luo Han entered a new frequency and password.

261
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
No way.

262
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
On the original frequency.

263
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
He's still using the Li Yue Se password to send a report.

264
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
His way of sending a report is very special.

265
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
The sound is long and the bass is very fast.

266
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I will never hear wrong.

267
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
The comrades of the Shanghai Bureau have already noticed the new radio station.

268
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
We've sent several reports.

269
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
We all have records.

270
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Now this Li Yue Se password.

271
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
It's very likely that Luo Han.

272
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
To confuse us.

273
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
So he deliberately stayed.

274
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Gu Yangshan said he got Luo Han's new radio station's password.

275
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I'll go find him right away.

276
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
So fast.

277
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Gu Yangshan's intelligence.

278
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
You know.

279
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Every morning at six o'clock.

280
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Luo Han will use the Li Yue Se password to send a report.

281
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
You still stay.

282
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Observe his situation.

283
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I can go by myself.

284
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
When I get the new password.

285
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
We still follow the original plan.

286
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Can't cheat.

287
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Okay.

288
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Then listen to you.

289
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Why?

290
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Why didn't Luo Han send a report today?

291
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Unless.

292
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Unless.

293
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Unless.

294
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Unless.

295
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Unless.

296
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Unless.

297
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Unless.

298
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Unless.

299
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Unless.

300
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Unless.

301
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Unless.

302
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Unless.

303
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Doctor.

304
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
The room you opened last time.

305
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
The number you have dialed.

306
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Hurry up.

307
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Search.

308
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I am Allen.

309
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
I am your uncle.

310
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Isthan's tent.

311
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Hurry up.

312
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
There is sp alma mater.

313
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
What else are you alright?

314
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Did you use your break pads?

315
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
It's alright.

316
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
You have publicity.

317
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Come on, let's go

318
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:27,660
Is that a abandoned factory?

319
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,120
Get in the car!

320
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:37,660
Comrade Biyun

321
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:39,980
What happened?

322
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:41,320
Someone was following me just now

323
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,560
I made a secret pass

324
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,380
Look at that

325
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,580
This is the pass

326
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:46,580
Look at it

327
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,680
How is it?

328
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,920
It's not the same as the code we've detected

329
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:02,420
It's fake

330
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:04,660
Fake?

331
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,900
How could it be fake?

332
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:13,820
This bastard

333
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:15,860
He would rather use a fake one and put it in the antidote

334
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:16,860
And he wants to get me out of here

335
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:40,400
It seems that he is no longer a

336
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,480
They are here

337
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:07,780
Secretary Liu, send someone to follow you

338
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:09,280
Find a high position

339
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:11,320
As long as someone comes out, we will take pictures

340
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:15,320
You, call Commander Cao

341
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,820
Tell him

342
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:18,820
The Communist Party and the mole have been found

343
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:20,820
Tell Commander Cao to bring someone here

344
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:21,820
Yes

345
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,760
Apshan

346
00:25:41,760 --> 00:26:09,240
Oh

347
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:12,760
Okay.

348
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:13,760
Let's go.

349
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14,760
Go.

350
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:15,760
Hurry.

351
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:16,760
We can't go together.

352
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:17,760
What did you say?

353
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:18,760
Luo Han was just suspecting you.

354
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:19,760
As long as he didn't find us on the streets, you wouldn't be exposed.

355
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,760
You go down from here,

356
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:22,760
back to Shanghai Station,

357
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,760
find the real code book.

358
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,760
I'm leaving, Luo Tian.

359
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:25,760
No.

360
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:26,760
You can't go, Luo Tian.

361
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:27,760
Luo Han is already crazy.

362
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:28,760
He won't care if we're really in the streets.

363
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:29,760
As long as he finds us here,

364
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,760
we can't leave.

365
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:31,760
Don't you understand?

366
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,760
Luo Han is crazy.

367
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,760
He wants us all to stay.

368
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:34,760
He's totally crazy.

369
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,760
You can't leave.

370
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,760
Luo Han is crazy.

371
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:37,760
I can't leave.

372
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:38,760
You can't leave.

373
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:39,760
Luo Han is crazy.

374
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:40,760
I can't leave.

375
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:41,760
Do you understand?

376
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:43,840
You're a spy.

377
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:46,400
You're destroying the map and peaceful liberation of Shanghai.

378
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,640
This is your mission.

379
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,920
I will complete my mission.

380
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:51,480
But I have to leave you safely.

381
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,200
If I can't leave you alone,

382
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,040
I won't let anything happen to you.

383
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,240
Ding Yi will kill me.

384
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,200
He will kill me.

385
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,200
Do you understand?

386
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,280
He won't.

387
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,480
He is a mature Communist.

388
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,480
He understands the meaning of the mission.

389
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,480
Shanghai will be liberated soon.

390
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:24,480
The cities of 6 million people can't be destroyed by a bunch of lunatics.

391
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,480
6 million people...

392
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,480
I understand what you're saying.

393
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,480
I will definitely find the real password.

394
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,880
But the premise is that we can't use anyone's sacrifice as a price.

395
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,880
Think about your story, comrade Bai Ye.

396
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,880
How did they complete the mission?

397
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:38,880
You don't know.

398
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
How did they complete the mission?

399
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
I didn't.

400
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
I didn't.

401
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
I remember them.

402
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
That's why I joined the Communist Party.

403
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
I'm a member of the Party.

404
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
I've been through the party oath.

405
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
I won't leave my comrades alone.

406
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Comrade Gu Yangshan.

407
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Since you've been through the oath,

408
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
please write down the party's record.

409
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
I'm your superior.

410
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
I'll obey your order.

411
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Give me the gun.

412
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
I can't make it.

413
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
I'll obey your order.

414
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
I'll definitely...

415
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
I'll obey your order.

416
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
We can leave separately.

417
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
But remember,

418
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
you have to write it down.

419
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Take care.

420
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Take care.

421
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Take care.

422
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,000
Come on.

423
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,000
Come on.

424
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,000
Come on.

425
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,000
Come on.

426
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Come on.

427
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Qin Biyun,

428
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
surrender.

429
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
You have no way out.

430
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
If you surrender now,

431
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
I'll protect you.

432
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
No one will die today.

433
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
I'm different from you.

434
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
I'm not afraid of death.

435
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
If I'm afraid of death,

436
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
I'll run away.

437
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
I'll be here.

438
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Nonsense.

439
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Come on.

440
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Big star,

441
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
do you have a way out?

442
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
You have the gun.

443
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
If you take the gun again,

444
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
you'll have 13 bullets.

445
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
You only have one bullet left.

446
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
You have no bullets to exchange.

447
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Right?

448
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Qin Biyun,

449
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
you're not a computer, are you?

450
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
You're not a good computer.

451
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
You should calculate it.

452
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
You just exchanged the bullet.

453
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Now you have 13 bullets.

454
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
You only have one bullet left.

455
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
If we fight,

456
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
who will win?

457
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
I will.

458
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Luo Han.

459
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Luo Han, I'm here.

460
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,120
Luo Han.

461
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,120
Stop being tough.

462
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,120
You took Gun-Yangshan's gun, right?

463
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,120
Look.

464
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,120
Did you see that?

465
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,120
Do you think you can cover

466
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,120
Gun-Yangshan by doing this?

467
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,120
Let me tell you.

468
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:58,120
I've marked the bullets

469
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:00,120
on his belt long ago.

470
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,120
Even if you kill me,

471
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,120
Gun-Yangshan can't escape.

472
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,120
Now,

473
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:13,120
can your faith save you?

474
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,120
Stand up.

475
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,120
I won't kill you.

476
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:36,120
I've marked the bullets

477
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:38,120
on his belt long ago.

478
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,120
Even if you kill me,

479
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:43,120
Gun-Yangshan can't escape.

480
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,120
Stop.

481
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,120
Put down the gun.

482
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,120
I'm sure you won't die.

483
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,120
Put it down.

484
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,120
I've calculated it.

485
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,120
We two

486
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:34,120
will die under Gun-Yangshan's gun.

487
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,120
What are you doing, Jian Mingyi?

488
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,120
I'm sorry.

489
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,120
I'm sorry.

490
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,120
I'm sorry.

491
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:33,120
You can't get the password

492
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:35,120
of the gun anymore.

493
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,120
I'm sorry.

494
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,120
Bi Yun.

495
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,120
Bi Yun.

496
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:27,120
What did you think

497
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:29,120
about what I said in the letter?

498
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:33,120
I wrote you a letter.

499
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,120
The letter said

500
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:36,120
I wanted to go back

501
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,120
to the troupe

502
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,120
and not to hold a wedding.

503
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:42,120
I've already asked my father

504
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:44,120
to contact Zhao Fu,

505
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:46,120
Aunt Sufen, and Long'er.

506
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,120
Do you

507
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,120
agree?

508
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,120
I received

509
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:53,120
that letter.

510
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:55,120
I wanted to go back

511
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:58,120
but I didn't know how to write it.

512
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,120
I thought about it

513
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,120
and I was delayed.

514
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:04,120
You

515
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:07,120
don't want to?

516
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:17,120
I'm just too happy.

517
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,120
I don't know how to write it.

518
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:33,120
I haven't seen him for so many years.

519
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,120
I miss him.

520
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:38,120
I heard that Long'er has her own troupe.

521
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,120
I should call her Chief Long.

522
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:43,120
Zhao Fu is writing a serial novel.

523
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:46,120
He has raised two rich families.

524
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,120
His article

525
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,120
can't be changed

526
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:51,120
at last.

527
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,120
Aunt Sufen

528
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:56,120
is with Zhao Fu.

529
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:57,120
I don't know

530
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:58,240
if his legs still hurt

531
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:00,240
in the rain

532
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,240
now.

533
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:05,240
He should be in middle school.

534
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,240
He has grown up.

535
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,240
Do you think

536
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,240
they still remember me?

537
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:18,240
They will.

538
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:24,240
Xian Biyun

539
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:26,240
is a woman

540
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,360
who has been through a lot.

541
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,360
She will be

542
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:32,360
a king in her whole life.

543
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,360
Your Majesty.

544
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:45,360
I'll wait for you.

545
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,360
I'll wait for you.

546
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:27,360
Your Majesty.

547
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,360
Your Majesty.

548
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:27,360
Your Majesty.

549
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:59,360
She is waiting

550
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:03,360
wandering in the shadow

551
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:06,360
The night falls

552
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:08,360
and I look back

553
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:10,360
at the bright future

554
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:13,360
The night falls

555
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:15,360
and I look back

556
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:19,360
at the bright future

557
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:29,360
The night falls
