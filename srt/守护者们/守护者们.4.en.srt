1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,300
Till then......

2
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The End

3
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 8

4
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
The reason why the code of Li Yueze is very difficult to decipher

5
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
is that he used a very complex function

6
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
to encrypt information.

7
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Even though the code of the code is the same,

8
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
the codes after encrypting are different.

9
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
So,

10
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
just by listening to the current code of the code,

11
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
it's not enough to decipher the code design rules.

12
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
We call this mode

13
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
the one-time-one-miss.

14
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I know that.

15
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
One-time-one-miss.

16
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
So,

17
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
we have to do it every day.

18
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Yes.

19
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
The one-time-one-miss has a very large amount of computing.

20
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
So, he has to train a lot of code specialists

21
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
to send them to the troops of the code system.

22
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
This is what you are doing for Li Yueze.

23
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
But,

24
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
don't worry.

25
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I have already learned the code of the code he developed.

26
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
And I have also learned the key production function.

27
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I guarantee that

28
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
even without him,

29
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,000
this code system can be operated very efficiently.

30
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Then what do you want me to do?

31
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
When you go to the media class next time,

32
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
tell Wu Tian that you have to say goodbye to him.

33
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Goodbye?

34
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Yes.

35
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Tell Wu Tian that

36
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
the codes you designed for him have been leaked from the British.

37
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Yan'er doesn't want to work for the Japanese anymore.

38
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
And she recommends him to return this code.

39
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
What?

40
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Brother,

41
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
you are talking with your mouth?

42
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
The Japanese are not fools.

43
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I just said a few words,

44
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
and he just said it.

45
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I just said a few words,

46
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
and he just said it.

47
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Don't worry.

48
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
We are not fools either.

49
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I will arrange an operation

50
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
to make the Japanese believe you.

51
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
But,

52
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
if he is

53
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
communicating with the enemy,

54
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
can you say that our code is absolutely safe?

55
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
That is...

56
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
But if he was the enemy's staff,

57
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
why did he suggest us

58
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
to develop a new code system?

59
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
The code can be easily

60
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
exposed by the enemy's operations,

61
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
and can be used in any battlefield in the US.

62
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I want to know

63
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
what happened to him

64
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
over the last few days.

65
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I will secretly search

66
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
his room in the Third Wave Foundation.

67
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I will secretly search his room in the Third Wave Foundation.

68
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I will secretly search his room in the Third Wave Foundation.

69
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Don't leave any evidence.

70
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Also, send someone

71
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
to watch over the Uelian Gonga.

72
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
But what about the Uelian Gonga?

73
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
You can't enter

74
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
the British Embassy

75
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
and investigate it.

76
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
But,

77
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
if I manage to do something,

78
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I may be able to put you in there.

79
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Answer me.

80
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
How do you remember

81
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
the things that Li Yue Se taught you?

82
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Is it difficult?

83
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
What are the steps that Li Yue Se taught you?

84
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
There are no steps.

85
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
He always gives me the right answers

86
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
and tells me the right solutions.

87
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I just memorize them.

88
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
You can memorize them all?

89
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I told you.

90
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I am the best at memorizing.

91
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
What are your memories?

92
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
This is the question

93
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
for the next time you go to the Uelian Gonga.

94
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
How long?

95
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
If you memorize it,

96
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
then a few hours.

97
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Okay.

98
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Memorizing is easy.

99
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
But it's difficult to memorize.

100
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Okay.

101
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Let's start the countdown.

102
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

103
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Ten.

104
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Ten.

105
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Ten.

106
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Ten.

107
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Ten.

108
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Ten.

109
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Ten.

110
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Ten.

111
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Ten.

112
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Ten.

113
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Ten.

114
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Ten.

115
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Eleven.

116
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Twelve.

117
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Ee.

118
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,560
꽃

119
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Think that we are�

120
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I'II tell yourissues

121
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
now.

122
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I really think

123
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,400
The doctor should be here now.

124
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,920
If you are the political expert,

125
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,480
don't write so slowly,

126
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,080
on your desk.

127
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:56,520
You need to Heaven

128
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,000
for the reader.

129
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,680
Don't know cooking means genius again?

130
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,680
You don't need to think about it.

131
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,320
You also...

132
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:08,880
Young Master.

133
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:09,680
Uncle Gu.

134
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,560
Miss Xian from Chaosheng Group is here.

135
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,080
She wants to see you.

136
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,520
See me?

137
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,680
Welcome, Miss Xian.

138
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,560
What do you want?

139
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,560
I wanted to rent this beautiful house.

140
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,560
But I'm too shy to do it.

141
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,560
I'm so unlucky.

142
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,560
You went to repay Miss Xian's kindness last time.

143
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,560
But she didn't accept it.

144
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,560
How did she know I was here?

145
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,560
I guess.

146
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,560
Now in Shanghai,

147
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,560
the ice-clad clothes are like a stone bomb.

148
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,560
You won't take it to your workplace.

149
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,560
And you won't take it home.

150
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,560
So I guess

151
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,560
this is the place

152
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,560
which is safe and quiet.

153
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,560
This is the place.

154
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,560
You're really smart.

155
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,560
You're really smart.

156
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,560
Well,

157
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,440
give me three days.

158
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,440
After three days,

159
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,440
I'll go to the hospital to repay Miss Xian.

160
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,440
The wife of the board of directors of the Ministry of Works

161
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,440
invited me to the wedding party

162
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,440
at 7 p.m.

163
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,440
at the William Hotel.

164
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,440
Does it have anything to do with me?

165
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,440
The Japanese spy

166
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,440
has found Li Yue-se's car

167
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,440
at the William Hotel.

168
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,320
I see.

169
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,320
Thank you for your notice.

170
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,320
Don't worry.

171
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,320
Li Yue-se will be at the wedding today.

172
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,320
But I need to ask Miss Xian

173
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,320
to do something for Mrs. William.

174
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,320
She must be at Li Yue-se's place

175
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,320
for a few days.

176
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,320
I'm here to inform you

177
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,320
that you're a man of your word.

178
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,320
So

179
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,200
what do you want to do?

180
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,200
Take care of Ding Yu.

181
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,200
I'll pick you up

182
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,200
at 6 p.m. tonight.

183
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,200
It doesn't matter how good your memory is.

184
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,200
Do you understand what it means?

185
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,200
You don't understand either.

186
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,080
I just need to memorize it.

187
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,080
It's not enough to memorize it.

188
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,080
The plan has changed.

189
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,080
Li Yue-se's car is in the William Hotel.

190
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,080
So he will send the Japanese to the William Hotel

191
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,080
to attend the wedding of Mrs. William.

192
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,080
The purpose is to see if Li Yue-se is there.

193
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,080
So you must attend the wedding tonight.

194
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,080
Wait a minute.

195
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,080
The wedding?

196
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,080
I can only tell you

197
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,080
that the wedding is more difficult than you can memorize.

198
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,080
Ding Yu,

199
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,960
if you were the one who was taught by Li Yue-se,

200
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,960
you won't copy her tonight.

201
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,960
You will become her.

202
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,960
The wedding will start in advance.

203
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:24,920
Vibe

204
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,920
Can-o-cata

205
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,120
You have to fix it.

206
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,120
All right.

207
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,120
Let's do it.

208
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,120
What are you doing?

209
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,120
Besides,

210
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,120
the facial expression is also a must-have

211
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:39,120
as a British gentleman like Li Yue Se.

212
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,120
That's so charming.

213
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,120
After wearing this high-heeled suit,

214
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,120
Li Yue Se, whom I know,

215
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,120
has become more mysterious.

216
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,120
As long as you want to be Li Yue Se,

217
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,120
you need to have this suit

218
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,120
and your eyes.

219
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,120
What are you doing?

220
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,120
Remember,

221
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,120
wearing a suit

222
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:03,120
is to put the horse in your pants.

223
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,120
And you must not show your shirt

224
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,120
between the horse and the pants.

225
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,120
If a suit is made

226
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,120
to be a high-heeled suit,

227
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,120
the most important feature

228
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:17,120
of this high-heeled suit is the cuff.

229
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,120
Li Yue Se always wanted to join

230
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,120
the World Mathematician Association.

231
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,120
So he asked someone to make a pair of cuff.

232
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,320
I've received an invitation from the association.

233
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,320
So this pair of cuff is real.

234
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,320
Good.

235
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,320
I'm not willing to wear it.

236
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,320
I'll give it to you today.

237
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,320
Take a look.

238
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,320
What's going on?

239
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,320
Li Yue Se is a fake.

240
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,320
I didn't expect you, the Chinese,

241
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,320
to be so vain.

242
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,320
It's not as good as you.

243
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,320
What do you mean by you?

244
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,320
Take it.

245
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,320
All right.

246
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,520
All right.

247
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,520
I'll take it.

248
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:13,520
You're really good at acting.

249
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,520
At home?

250
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,520
Really?

251
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,520
Yes.

252
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,520
All right.

253
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,520
Stop acting.

254
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:29,520
You'd better leave your acting to tonight.

255
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,520
Yes, I'm tired.

256
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,520
I'll do it myself.

257
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,520
You're welcome.

258
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,520
Wait.

259
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:44,520
This is a cuff, not a cuff.

260
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,520
The way of using a cuff

261
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:49,520
is to fold it and then put it on your legs.

262
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,520
Enjoy.

263
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,520
Enjoy.

264
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,520
Wait.

265
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,520
The way of using a cuff

266
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,520
is not your business.

267
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,520
Don't do it yourself.

268
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,520
Sit down.

269
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,520
Angus Royer

270
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,520
There was a woman

271
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,520
who was eating with Li Yue Se.

272
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,520
She was a very good cook.

273
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,720
She was used to eating.

274
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,720
She ate 150 grams of rice every time.

275
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,720
She ate one gram of rice and one gram of rice.

276
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,720
One meal with three grams of beef?

277
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,720
It's too much.

278
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,720
Excuse me.

279
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,720
It's so much blood.

280
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:44,720
It's not cooked, right?

281
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,720
How can I eat raw?

282
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,720
I don't eat it.

283
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,720
I'll get a stomachache after eating it.

284
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,720
I'll eat your beef.

285
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:51,920
I'll eat your...

286
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:55,920
snail?

287
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:02,420
It's a

288
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:04,420
snail.

289
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:06,420
I didn't write this.

290
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:08,420
I want to try.

291
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:18,420
I'll change the place.

292
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,120
I'll change the place.

293
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,120
I'll change the place.

294
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,120
I'll change the place.

295
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:49,820
I don't want to.

296
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:50,820
I'm about to start.

297
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,820
How could I drink so much?

298
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:05,820
Time is up.

299
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:08,820
Finish?

300
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:09,820
Almost.

301
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:11,820
It's so difficult to talk.

302
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:14,820
You put it down.

303
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,820
If you can't accept western food,

304
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:18,820
You'll be away from the ruins after the party.

305
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:20,820
I'll find a quiet place for you to sit down.

306
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:21,820
I'll sit here.

307
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:22,820
The ruins.

308
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:23,820
The self-serve.

309
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:24,820
The self-serve.

310
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:26,820
By the way,

311
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,820
you must pay attention to the language.

312
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,820
There will be a lot of foreigners after the party.

313
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:32,820
You must keep your mouth shut.

314
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:33,820
If you want to express something,

315
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:34,820
I'll do it for you.

316
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:35,820
It's okay.

317
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:36,820
I can express.

318
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:37,820
I can express.

319
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:39,820
You forgot that I'm an actor.

320
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:41,820
I've played all the Shakespeare's plays.

321
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:42,820
I'm a good actor.

322
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:44,820
In addition, the Institute of Science and Technology taught me a few.

323
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:45,820
I can deal with them.

324
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:46,820
It's enough.

325
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:47,820
It's enough.

326
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:50,820
Are you sure you've really played Shakespeare's plays?

327
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,820
And not just seen other people's scripts?

328
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:55,820
You...

329
00:16:58,820 --> 00:16:59,820
Don't worry.

330
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:00,820
I can express anyway.

331
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:02,820
Don't mind him.

332
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:03,820
Let's get down to business.

333
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:06,820
If I don't eat anything,

334
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:08,820
I'll just watch others eat.

335
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:09,820
Mr. Li,

336
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:10,820
you can't see.

337
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:11,820
How's your alcohol tolerance?

338
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:14,820
I'll get you a glass of wine at the party.

339
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:15,820
It'll make you feel awkward.

340
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:19,820
You're embarrassing me.

341
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:21,820
Don't look at my small body.

342
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:23,820
It's like a walking wine cellar.

343
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:25,820
One or two catties of alcohol.

344
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:27,820
Three or four catties doesn't count.

345
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:32,820
But your wine is not strong.

346
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:33,820
It's full of tea.

347
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:35,820
You're lying.

348
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:37,820
It's full of alcohol.

349
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:38,820
You're lying.

350
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:39,820
It's full of alcohol.

351
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:41,820
You're lying.

352
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:42,820
Got it?

353
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:43,820
Let me try.

354
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:48,820
No.

355
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,820
You can't drink like that.

356
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:51,820
You'll get drunk.

357
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:52,820
Let him drink.

358
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:53,820
It's a little sour.

359
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:56,820
Maybe we'll make some money if we drink it.

360
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:58,820
That's what you said.

361
00:17:58,820 --> 00:17:59,820
It's in my heart.

362
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:00,820
Come on.

363
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:02,820
Bro,

364
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:03,820
I'll drink to your words.

365
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:04,820
I'll drink to your words.

366
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:07,820
I'll drink to your words.

367
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:08,820
Let him drink.

368
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:12,820
Okay, okay.

369
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:13,820
I know you're good at drinking.

370
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:15,820
But you can't leave the alcohol for tonight.

371
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:18,820
It's not that.

372
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:19,820
Don't be afraid.

373
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:20,820
I can drink.

374
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,820
Luoyang's friends ask.

375
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:24,820
Let's drink to this.

376
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:25,820
Let's talk.

377
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:27,820
Young master.

378
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:31,820
Miss Xian's father Ding Yi's car is waiting for us.

379
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:34,820
Come on.

380
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:41,820
Come on.

381
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:43,820
Sit.

382
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:47,820
Why don't you watch him?

383
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:51,820
How about we cancel the operation?

384
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:53,820
He's drunk.

385
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:54,820
I think the Japanese don't have to ask.

386
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:55,820
He'll confess everything.

387
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:57,820
It's impossible to cancel it.

388
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:59,820
If he's still like this when we get there,

389
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:00,820
I'll put him in the cell.

390
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:01,820
It's impossible.

391
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:03,820
I can't drink.

392
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:04,820
I can't talk.

393
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:07,820
I can talk when I need to.

394
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:10,820
It's not easy for Mrs. Wei Lian to agree to help.

395
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:11,820
If you fail,

396
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:12,820
you can close the door.

397
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:15,820
It's too hard for you.

398
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:20,820
Are you okay?

399
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:27,820
Ding Yi.

400
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:31,820
It's the East.

401
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:36,820
And Julie...

402
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:40,820
is the Sun.

403
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:45,820
I'm telling you, Julie.

404
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,820
The rose I gave you...

405
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:52,820
is the Sun.

406
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:55,820
I'm telling you, Julie.

407
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:59,820
The rose I gave you...

408
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:02,820
is the Sun.

409
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:04,820
Do you hear me?

410
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:28,820
The Sun

411
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:48,820
Miss Jian.

412
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:49,820
You finally came.

413
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:51,820
Mrs. Wei Lian is waiting for you.

414
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:53,820
Please tell Mrs. Wei Lian

415
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,820
that I'll be there right away.

416
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:09,820
Ding Yi, it's time to wake up.

417
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:11,820
You scared me.

418
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:13,820
Are you feeling better?

419
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:17,820
I feel a little sick, but I'm not very dizzy.

420
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:22,820
How are you?

421
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:24,820
I'm not very dizzy, but I feel a little sick.

422
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:26,820
It's time to go in.

423
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:27,820
I'll go find Mrs. Wei Lian.

424
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:28,820
Take care of her.

425
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:30,820
Don't let anything happen to her.

426
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:32,820
Don't worry. I'll take care of her.

427
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:33,820
Let's go.

428
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:44,820
Wait.

429
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:46,820
Where are your glasses?

430
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:48,820
Did you give them to me?

431
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:50,820
When did you give them to me?

432
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:51,820
When we were drinking.

433
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:54,820
This is not my pair.

434
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:55,820
This is mine.

435
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:56,820
Take it.

436
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:58,820
Let's go.

437
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:21,820
Hello.

438
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:23,820
It's been a long time.

439
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:24,820
You're beautiful again.

440
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:26,820
You're beautiful today too.

441
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:27,820
Thank you.

442
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:33,820
Hello, Miss Xian.

443
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:34,820
It's been a long time.

444
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,820
Mr. Zhang, it's been a long time.

445
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:37,820
Hello.

446
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:38,820
Hello.

447
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:39,820
Miss Xian is beautiful again.

448
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:45,820
You're here again.

449
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:46,820
Ding Yi.

450
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:48,820
Thank you.

451
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:49,820
Hello, Miss Xian.

452
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:53,820
Hello.

453
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:57,820
Nice to meet you.

454
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:58,820
Thank you.

455
00:22:58,820 --> 00:22:59,820
You're very kind.

456
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:03,820
Hello.

457
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:05,820
Miss Xian, you left me so soon.

458
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:07,820
I'm so happy today.

459
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:08,820
Yes.

460
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:20,820
Hi, Cindy.

461
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:21,820
Hi, Ding Yi.

462
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:22,820
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

463
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:23,820
Sorry.

464
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:25,820
Sorry.

465
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:31,820
Madam William, I apologize for not being able to attend the opening of the banquet today.

466
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:32,820
It's okay.

467
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:35,820
Where is Mr. William?

468
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:40,820
Oh, his eye disease has occurred, so he went back to rest.

469
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,820
Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that.

470
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:44,820
Thank you.

471
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:47,820
You're welcome.

472
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:48,820
Can I have a sip of water?

473
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:49,820
I'm a little bit sugar-coated.

474
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:52,820
I'll find a place for you to sit down first, then I'll get you some water.

475
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:11,820
Mr. Li, please sit down.

476
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:12,820
Okay.

477
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:13,820
I'll get you some water.

478
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:14,820
Okay.

479
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:15,820
Thank you.

480
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:16,820
I'll get you some water.

481
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:17,820
Okay.

482
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:23,820
Please cooperate with me.

483
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:46,820
Why is he here?

484
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:48,820
Shouldn't they be here?

485
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:49,820
Otherwise, why are we here?

486
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:51,820
Didn't you see that there were three people here?

487
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:56,820
That girl is Meng Jian.

488
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:59,820
Her father is the deputy chief of the medical department, Meng Bingyi.

489
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:00,820
She has a connection with my father.

490
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:01,820
Meng Jian and I...

491
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:04,820
I understand.

492
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:06,820
But she should be in Chongqing.

493
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:07,820
Why is she here?

494
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:10,820
I don't know.

495
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:11,820
I don't know.

496
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:12,820
I don't know.

497
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:13,820
I don't know.

498
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:14,820
Why are we here?

499
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:21,820
It seems that Meng Bingyi has become a family member.

500
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:24,820
Please cooperate with me.

501
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:26,820
I'm very tired today.

502
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:27,820
I've been with you for a long time.

503
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:28,820
Please cooperate with me.

504
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:31,820
But Meng Jian looks very nervous.

505
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:34,820
Maybe he was invited by Xiao Lin and Jingde.

506
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:37,820
Brother, can we not study others?

507
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:38,820
You study me, okay?

508
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:39,820
I'm almost throwing up.

509
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:40,820
You wait a little longer.

510
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:43,820
When Jingde and Xiao Lin find Li Yuese in the night,

511
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:44,820
our show will be over.

512
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:49,820
Why don't we go over there and say hello to him?

513
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:50,820
It's better than this.

514
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:05,820
Don't look at me.

515
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:07,820
You're a cat.

516
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:11,820
Do you want?

517
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:14,820
No.

518
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:15,820
Thanks.

519
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:16,820
Thanks.

520
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:36,820
Let's go back, Kono.

521
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:37,820
Wait.

522
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:39,820
Go to the bathroom.

523
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:42,820
Go to the bathroom.

524
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:44,820
Look.

525
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:49,820
Shixian.

526
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:51,820
Shixian.

527
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:55,820
Shixian.

528
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:57,820
Shixian.

529
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:00,820
Sorry, sorry.

530
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:01,820
Are you okay?

531
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:03,820
Sorry, sorry.

532
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:04,820
Mr. Li.

533
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:06,820
I knocked down a lady.

534
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:07,820
Go to take care of her.

535
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:08,820
Okay.

536
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:09,820
Are you okay?

537
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:11,820
Let me.

538
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:12,820
Okay.

539
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:13,820
Come on.

540
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:16,820
Shixian.

541
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:17,820
Yes, yes, yes.

542
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:18,820
I'm really sorry.

543
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:19,820
I'm sorry, girl.

544
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:24,820
Mr. Li.

545
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:28,820
You are...

546
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:29,820
Jin Dengfang?

547
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:32,820
You're here too.

548
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:34,820
Come on.

549
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:36,820
Did you twist your ankle?

550
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:37,820
I...

551
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:38,820
Mr. Li.

552
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:39,820
This lady's ankle is twisted.

553
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:41,820
I'll send her out and come back soon.

554
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:42,820
Go.

555
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:44,820
I can do it myself.

556
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:45,820
Okay.

557
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:57,820
This is so romantic.

558
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:05,820
Shixian.

559
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:11,820
The river flows east.

560
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:14,820
The daughter of Luoyang is called Mochou.

561
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:17,820
Mochou is the 13th gate's wife.

562
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:20,820
The 14th is the bridegroom's son, Mochou.

563
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:23,820
The 15th is the father of the Lu family.

564
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:30,820
Shixian.

565
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:36,820
Thank you.

566
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:42,820
Thank you.

567
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:49,820
Hello.

568
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:52,820
Hello.

569
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:54,820
Excuse me.

570
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:02,820
Heng.

571
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:06,580
Ye Yin?

572
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:09,820
Mr. Li,

573
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:13,340
Chief Wu Tian has been looking for you.

574
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:17,540
Are you okay these days?

575
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:27,180
I'm fine.

576
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:31,780
Let's go to the mountain.

577
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:36,780
Do you dare?

578
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:48,120
You're brave enough to bear the

579
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:48,700
...

580
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:55,680

It's time for cities toof

584
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:19,320
Why are you still so beautiful?

585
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,240
I'm not like Mrs. Liang,

586
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,960
who has such a good fortune,

587
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,960
and married a good man.

588
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,200
How are you and Liang?

589
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:35,200
Liang has no words for me.

590
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:38,520
It's just that the bastard, Jun Tong,

591
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,040
took advantage of the bad luck

592
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:42,440
to sing Liang's song to the war in Suzhou,

593
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,280
and gave him a round table.

594
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:46,200
How could this be?

595
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,200
What about Mr. Liang?

596
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,760
Forget it, I won't say it.

597
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,400
You know Liang,

598
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,400
he doesn't like to fight.

599
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,600
It's good that

600
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:05,240
Chairman Wang is doing peacekeeping in Shanghai.

601
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:07,120
He wants to come with Liang.

602
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,320
He can't come,

603
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,320
I'll do something for him.

604
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,800
Yes,

605
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:14,680
who is willing to fight every day to be peaceful?

606
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,720
Yes.

607
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:22,120
I just heard something from Chairman Wei Lian.

608
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:30,320
Maybe Chairman Wang will be interested.

609
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,840
Biyun, come here.

610
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,840
I'll talk to you later.

611
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,680
Are you still here?

612
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,680
I'm in your house.

613
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:29,680
Thank you for your hard work today.

614
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,680
It's okay.

615
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:35,680
There is no big work tonight.

616
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,680
Do you have a towel?

617
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,680
It's right in front of you.

618
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,680
I forgot.

619
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,680
You can't see anything.

620
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,680
Mr. Li,

621
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:03,680
do you like to eat beef?

622
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,680
Don't drink anymore.

623
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,680
I'm not drinking anymore.

624
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,680
Don't mention my mother again.

625
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,680
I hate you.

626
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:21,680
Miss, I'm sorry.

627
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,680
My husband is waiting for me inside.

628
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,680
I have to go.

629
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:30,680
Miss,

630
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,680
is there anything else?

631
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,680
A business card.

632
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,680
This is my workplace.

633
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,680
I'll be here all day.

634
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,680
You can come to me anytime.

635
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,680
Okay.

636
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,680
Miss Bo,

637
00:33:56,680 --> 00:34:00,680
I believe we will meet again.

638
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,680
Goodbye.

639
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:14,680
Where are you going?

640
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:16,680
I'm going to see Mrs. Wenlin.

641
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:20,680
We haven't talked about it yet.

642
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:44,680
I'm sorry.

643
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,680
Mr. Li, are you okay?

644
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,680
Let me go!

645
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:21,680
I can't see anything.

646
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:22,680
You can't see anything either.

647
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:23,680
There is something on the ground.

648
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,680
Why didn't you tell me?

649
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,680
I'm sorry, Mr. Li.

650
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,680
Don't follow me anymore.

651
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:32,680
Get out!

652
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,680
Yes.

653
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:38,680
Your suit.

654
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,680
Wait.

655
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,680
Don't pretend.

656
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,680
You can see.

657
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:58,680
What are you talking about?

658
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:03,680
I hate it when people joke with my eyes.

659
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,680
I hate it when people joke with my eyes.

660
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,680
I hate it when people joke with my eyes.

661
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,680
I hate it when people joke with my eyes.

662
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:12,680
I hate it when people joke with my eyes.

663
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:16,680
I tried to trick you.

664
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:21,680
I put the cake in front of you.

665
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,680
And you...

666
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,680
You put it on the table.

667
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:28,680
You also put it on the cake.

668
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:30,680
But you don't know.

669
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,680
My real problem is...

670
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:36,680
This.

671
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:40,680
I can put my suit on top of your suit.

672
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:46,680
If you are blind, you should take the top one.

673
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:50,680
Or at least start from the top one.

674
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:52,680
But how did you do it?

675
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:00,680
To leave my world earlier,

676
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:04,680
I did it accurately, quickly and accurately.

677
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:08,680
Your own suit.

678
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,680
You don't want me.

679
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:21,680
How did you bring a gun to my party?

680
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,680
Sir, put down your gun, please.

681
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:30,680
Step back! Step back!

682
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:38,680
Mr. Li is a guest of Chief Wu Tian.

683
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:40,680
Your gun is Mr. Li.

684
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:42,680
Is it right?

685
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:43,680
No!

686
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,680
He is our enemy.

687
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:54,680
Charlie!

688
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:57,680
Mr. Li.

689
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:58,680
Don't be angry.

690
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,680
Help me get my suit.

691
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,680
Yes, Mr. Li.

692
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,680
Yes, Mr. Li.

693
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,680
Mr. Jinteng.

694
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:25,680
You killed me because I took my suit.

695
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,680
You are a fool.

696
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:30,680
It's ridiculous.

697
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:34,680
Do you think I can't kill you?

698
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:36,680
Calm down.

699
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,680
I just want to tell you.

700
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:44,680
You can take two suits without using your eyes.

701
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:47,680
I think you can do it.

702
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:50,680
But you can't.

703
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:54,680
Mr. Jinteng, can I borrow your suit?

704
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:58,680
What are you doing?

705
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,680
Give me your suit.

706
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:03,680
I can give you a satisfactory answer.

707
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:11,680
Mr. Li, I got the suit.

708
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:14,680
Everything here is a lie.

709
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:17,680
You can't get the suit.

710
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,680
I got it.

711
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:25,680
Everyone here knows that the fabric and the fabric are the face of the suit.

712
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:32,680
The fabric and the fabric are the face of the suit.

713
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:36,680
The fabric is the same as the suit.

714
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:41,680
The suit is made of the material of the whole horse.

715
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:44,680
But I am made of wool.

716
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:48,680
The suit is made of wool.

717
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:54,680
Shanghai is the best for this weather.

718
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:58,680
So I can recognize my suit.

719
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:02,680
As for you,

720
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:09,680
you don't have a suit.

721
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:12,680
Shut up!

722
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:16,680
Don't lie to me.

723
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:20,680
You took the suit from me.

724
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:23,680
You didn't touch it.

725
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:26,680
You are very careful.

726
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:29,680
I didn't touch it seriously.

727
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:36,680
Because I touched this.

728
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:43,680
I just found out that there is a hole here.

729
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:46,680
I can see it.

730
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:48,680
It's made of cloth.

731
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:51,680
But I can feel it clearly.

732
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:58,680
To become Li Yue Se, you need a suit.

733
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:01,680
You need to understand the reason.

734
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,680
This is a flower pot.

735
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:07,680
The nobles of the Zhou Dynasty used this to decorate themselves.

736
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:11,680
Soldiers would open the first button

737
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,680
and turn the clothes over.

738
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,680
This way of dressing was popular in the folk clothes.

739
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:21,680
It became a suit and kept the button.

740
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:24,680
Shanghai's tailor made this.

741
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:28,680
The tailor on the street is used to making the flower pot.

742
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:31,680
My tailor is more common.

743
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:34,680
He has his own custom.

744
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:38,680
He is the only tailor in the world.

745
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:46,680
So, I took the flower pot.

746
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:48,680
But I'm sorry.

747
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:50,680
I didn't think it through.

748
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:54,680
I didn't think that your suit was made by me.

749
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:57,680
I should have more time to touch it.

750
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:02,680
But there is no flower pot on your suit.

751
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:04,680
I'm sorry.

752
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:09,680
There is no flower pot on the neck of this suit.

753
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:12,680
What a pity.

754
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:24,680
Who is this Japanese?

755
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:27,680
I will let the Japanese come in.

756
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:29,680
Get out.

757
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:31,680
Get out.

758
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:35,680
The lady is here.

759
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:41,680
Li San, I'm very sorry.

760
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:46,680
But Mr. Takeda wants to see you.

761
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:56,680
I'm sorry.

762
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:26,680
I'm sorry.

763
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:56,680
I'm sorry.

00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:26,680
I'm sorry.

765
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:58,680
The End
