1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,600
ов

2
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:38,280
You

3
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:09,000
I did it spicily,it's still my plight to do it.

4
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Thank you.

5
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
We will meet tomorrow at noon.

6
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Goodbye.

7
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,000
General Guan, who is Liang Jingyuan?

8
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
He used to work in the dormitory.

9
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
But he often had contact with Shanghai Station.

10
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I guess he must have defected.

11
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
It seems that Shanghai Station is completely destroyed.

12
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Fortunately, he has never seen me.

13
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
General Guan,

14
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
now your Shanghai Station is destroyed.

15
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
You are the only one left.

16
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
What are you going to do?

17
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I'd better find a way to send you away as soon as possible.

18
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I'll go and see the back.

19
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
There is no one here.

20
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Go away.

21
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I'm not going.

22
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
What did you say?

23
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I said I'm not going.

24
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
This is our Chinese territory.

25
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Why should we let the Japanese run around?

26
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I ran from the northeast to the White Horse Lake.

27
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
And I ran from the White Horse Lake to Shanghai.

28
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Am I not far enough?

29
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
But what happened?

30
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Now the whole street is still full of Japanese.

31
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I disagree.

32
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Are you kidding?

33
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Who said you wanted to go?

34
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Do you want to die?

35
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I'm not kidding.

36
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I'm telling the truth.

37
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
And you said before,

38
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
if everyone ran away,

39
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
we would be not far from the Mongolia.

40
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
And now you are the only one left in Shanghai Station.

41
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
If I don't take the action,

42
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
there is no way to complete it.

43
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
If I run away now,

44
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
then all the efforts you spent on me before,

45
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I would have been in vain.

46
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
The Liyue Department of Security has been replaced.

47
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
And you killed Wu Tian yourself.

48
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
You have done a lot.

49
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I am very grateful to you.

50
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
But we don't know what the situation is in the Liyue Department of Security.

51
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Liang Jingyuan is not only asking you to be the deputy director,

52
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
but also asking you to move into Sanyang.

53
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Do you know what this means?

54
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
What does it mean?

55
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
It means you have to deal with cryptography experts every day.

56
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
You are not a soldier or a spy.

57
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
But Liang Jingyuan is different.

58
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Liang Jingyuan is very suspicious.

59
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
If he finds out that your accent is wrong today,

60
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
he will find out more things that shouldn't exist on Li Yunse tomorrow.

61
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
If you make any mistakes,

62
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
we can't save you.

63
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
You know my learning ability.

64
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
And my performance was not bad before.

65
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
What's wrong with me?

66
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
You can teach me.

67
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I can't.

68
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
You have to go today.

69
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
No.

70
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:33,000
The day of the sacrifice,

71
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I was sadder than you.

72
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I thought about it all night in my room.

73
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
The gods are gone.

74
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
These four words are your family name.

75
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Uncle Gu,

76
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
even your sister,

77
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
can shed blood for these four words.

78
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
But these four words,

79
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
shouldn't we, the poor people,

80
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
take the responsibility?

81
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Mingyu,

82
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
we have been through so much together.

83
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
In my heart,

84
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
you are my brother.

85
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Actually, I have only one purpose for you.

86
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I want to protect you.

87
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
You have said so much just now.

88
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I understand.

89
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
You are no longer the Ding Yi you used to be.

90
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
But if you stay,

91
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
we will face the difficulties of the past.

92
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Have you really thought it through?

93
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
What do you really want to do?

94
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I am an actor.

95
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
This is my favorite role.

96
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
As long as you can help me to make the stage better,

97
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I will definitely be able to play this role well.

98
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Okay.

99
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Okay.

100
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Let's wait and see.

101
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,400
KING FOUNDATION

102
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:45,280
Let's go.

103
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:49,000
Looks pretty good.

104
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Come on!

105
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Mr. Li, the stairs are here.

106
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Mr. Li, turn right.

107
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Stairs.

108
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Right here.

109
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Excuse me.

110
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Excuse me.

111
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Excuse me.

112
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Excuse me.

113
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
It's okay.

114
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Let's not disturb other guests.

115
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Don't worry.

116
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Don't be sorry.

117
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Let's find a place to clean up.

118
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Okay, boss.

119
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Please come to the bathroom.

120
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Please come to the bathroom.

121
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
This way.

122
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Excuse me, boss.

123
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Excuse me.

124
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
This way.

125
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Excuse me.

126
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
This way, boss.

127
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
This way, please.

128
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
The stairs are here.

129
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Wait.

130
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Mr. Li is going to clean up.

131
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
It's not convenient for you to enter.

132
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Just wait at the door.

133
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Mr. Li.

134
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
The door.

135
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Use the chair to open the clothes.

136
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Make some noise.

137
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Are you okay?

138
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
It's okay.

139
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
You can talk.

140
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Wang Wei's men sent people to blow up the flour factory.

141
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Cao Yanzhong and some people were transferred to safety.

142
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
But the brothers outside are dead.

143
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
The one who blew up Shanghai station is Liang Jieyuan.

144
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
We've just seen him in the hospital.

145
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
He used to work in Suzhou station.

146
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
He has been in contact with Shanghai station.

147
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I've already reported to the superior.

148
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
There are strict confidentiality between local stations and local stations.

149
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
They don't listen.

150
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I'm not going to let them know.

151
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
They don't listen.

152
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
The work is just starting.

153
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
The business is not going well.

154
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Luohan, calm down.

155
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
We shouldn't have any hope for the military.

156
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Why are you saying such a taboo again?

157
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
If you leave the military, your Gu family will be over.

158
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Besides, revolution is always a matter of killing the army.

159
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
The military is not as bad as you think.

160
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Okay, let's not talk about this.

161
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
You're leaving Shanghai tonight.

162
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Chongqing is waiting for you to go back to work.

163
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
But you have to take Liang Jieyuan to Chongqing

164
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
for the establishment of the secret research institute.

165
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Since you can't get out of it,

166
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I'll find a way to find Cao Yuezhong as soon as possible.

167
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
To restore Shanghai station.

168
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
To restore the contact with Chongqing.

169
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
No.

170
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
We don't know how much Liang Jieyuan has infiltrated Shanghai station.

171
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
You can't contact the people in the station.

172
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I'm a voice.

173
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I'll be your contact.

174
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I'll help you carry out the establishment of the secret research institute.

175
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Luohan, the establishment of the secret research institute is not your job.

176
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
No matter what, you shouldn't stay.

177
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
To carry out the plan.

178
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Ge Xiaoshan.

179
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
The person I admire the most is my senior brother.

180
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
After coming to Shanghai,

181
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
you are my most admired comrade.

182
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
You carry out the plan.

183
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I'm willing to stay.

184
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Besides, I said before.

185
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
If you and this little bastard

186
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
let Wutian change the password of Li Yuanse.

187
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I, Luohan, will take you to the city.

188
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
It's my turn to fulfill the promise.

189
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Are you done?

190
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
You are the little bastard.

191
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Your whole family is the little bastard.

192
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I'll tell you one last time.

193
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I am an actor.

194
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
You are the arrow action.

195
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I am the protagonist.

196
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I am the sword.

197
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Don't be angry.

198
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I have always been looking at you.

199
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
But I have to admit that I underestimated you.

200
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I am willing to lose.

201
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
From now on,

202
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I will help you two to keep the horse safe.

203
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
You two will never stop.

204
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
For the party,

205
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
no, for the country.

206
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
And the people.

207
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Get on stage.

208
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Get dressed.

209
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
From today on,

210
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Luohan is our contact.

211
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Yuying Pavilion is crowded.

212
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
It's not good to hear.

213
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
We'll meet here in the future.

214
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
After we enter Sanyang Li,

215
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
if Luohan meets any emergency,

216
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
we will send a message to Sanyang Li.

217
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
We will know when we see the message.

218
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
You have to contact us.

219
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
We will find a way to pick up in time.

220
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
The strong and strong, Yuying Pavilion.

221
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
The arrow is in the air.

222
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
The red and red is the silver.

223
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
The silver is made of iron.

224
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,760
letter to the

225
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,760
The

226
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
drops to

227
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Even if you take into service

228
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,420
E'en

229
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:37,480
So

230
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:52,440
new

231
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,840
Can you love me , too?

232
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,340
Chi Hai Dong It's not a 2- pepper soup

233
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:06,140
Vacuum cleaner

234
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:08,460
Appetit

235
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:13,000
Shaved ice

236
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,020
Dian

237
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:17,560
Mr. Stop

238
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:22,100
I sent a friend

239
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:25,520
I knew this before

240
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,480
This is a perfect match

241
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,200
You're so good to her.

242
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,000
Yeah.

243
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:31,840
Here you go.

244
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,680
No.

245
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,000
We're so close.

246
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,800
Why do you have to share mine?

247
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,200
Don't touch it.

248
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,320
Bin Yun.

249
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,520
I'm so embarrassed

250
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,960
to have you give me something.

251
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,240
You should thank me.

252
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,760
Did Liang successfully transfer to Shanghai?

253
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:48,760
You deserve it.

254
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,600
By the way,

255
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,040
what's the position

256
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,040
that your Liang has?

257
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,040
A director.

258
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,040
What director?

259
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,800
Director of the password research institute.

260
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,600
The password research institute?

261
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,640
The Japanese

262
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:07,000
have built a system of information

263
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,160
to support the new government of President Wang

264
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,880
and to establish a password research institute.

265
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,960
They're the ones who make Liang the director.

266
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,200
The Japanese value Liang a lot.

267
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,160
Aunt,

268
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,280
congratulations.

269
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,800
I'll rely on you from now on.

270
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,680
That's good.

271
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,080
You'll be the director in the future.

272
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,640
Let's earn money together.

273
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,440
Miss Jian,

274
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,440
Mr. Li is here.

275
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,840
Miss Jian,

276
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,040
I didn't disturb you, did I?

277
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,000
Mr. Li.

278
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,160
Mr. Li.

279
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,680
It's been a long time.

280
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,520
You finally see me today.

281
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,200
I won't disturb you then, Bin Yun.

282
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,240
I'll buy you some tea.

283
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,240
Okay, let's go.

284
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,840
Charlie,

285
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,760
please send this lady off.

286
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:12,880
Please.

287
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:26,080
Mr. Li.

288
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,320
Why are you here?

289
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,520
Why didn't you wait for Wu to pick you up?

290
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,680
Miss Jian,

291
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,280
I'm here

292
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,720
to tell you something very important.

293
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,880
What is it?

294
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,880
I'm not leaving.

295
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,800
I decided to stay.

296
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,080
Okay.

297
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Mr. Wu,

298
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,680
would you like some tea?

299
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,560
No, thank you.

300
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,680
When I came upstairs,

301
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,800
I overheard

302
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,800
you talking about the password lab.

303
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:20,880
Zuo Zuo Meng

304
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,560
asked me to enter the password lab

305
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,560
and be the deputy director.

306
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,560
I agreed.

307
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,560
So I think

308
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,720
I can help you.

309
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,720
You should know

310
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,720
how dangerous it is for you to stay.

311
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,200
Miss Jian,

312
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,720
I haven't been back for a long time.

313
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,520
When I walked to the backstage,

314
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,400
I saw the whole crew.

315
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,320
I thought

316
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,520
I should wake up.

317
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,600
Now that my father

318
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,600
has been sent to the house,

319
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,280
we can't escape.

320
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,480
If we don't move forward,

321
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,200
someone will do it for me.

322
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,400
Gu and Hongyu were there before.

323
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,280
Who's next?

324
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,680
Gu Yaoshan?

325
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,680
Or you?

326
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,280
Miss Jian,

327
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,680
I don't want to be behind you forever.

328
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,680
In the tree of fate,

329
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,680
we are in the same line.

330
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,680
I've read this line

331
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,680
for several times.

332
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,680
I didn't expect

333
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,680
I could understand it today.

334
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,680
So, Miss Jian,

335
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,680
because of this,

336
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,680
I can't go back to the past.

337
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,680
I should stay.

338
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,680
I don't want you to protect me.

339
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,680
I want to protect you

340
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,680
and even

341
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,680
help you solve the problem.

342
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,680
What can I do?

343
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,680
When you rehearsed

344
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:58,760
and met Orca,

345
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,760
you would feel sad for several days.

346
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:03,760
But today,

347
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,760
you gave it to that woman.

348
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,760
So you must have something to ask her.

349
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:11,760
But now it's okay.

350
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,760
I'm the vice director of the password research institute.

351
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,760
You don't have to ask anyone else anymore.

352
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:19,760
I'm here.

353
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:24,760
Miss Jian,

354
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:27,840
after I enter the forest tomorrow,

355
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:29,840
I may lose my freedom

356
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:31,840
and can't contact you.

357
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:33,840
If you need my help

358
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:35,840
in a hurry,

359
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:39,840
I have an idea.

360
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:55,840
What is it?

361
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:22,840
I'm here.

362
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,760
I'm here.

363
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,760
What did you say?

364
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,760
Oh,

365
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:53,760
Miss Xian said

366
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:54,760
I should listen to you.

367
00:22:58,760 --> 00:22:59,760
She said that?

368
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:04,760
Let's go.

369
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:05,760
Follow me.

370
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:20,760
Hurry up.

371
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:41,760
Give them all a ride.

372
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,760
Hurry up.

373
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,760
Director Li,

374
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:21,760
hello.

375
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,760
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

376
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:25,760
Mr. Li, slow down.

377
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,760
I didn't expect to see you again so soon.

378
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:33,760
Mr. Li,

379
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:34,760
I'll get my luggage.

380
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:39,760
I'm sorry.

381
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:41,760
I'm sorry.

382
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:43,760
I'm sorry.

383
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:45,760
I'm sorry.

384
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:47,760
I'm sorry.

385
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,760
The sound of this lady

386
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,760
sounds familiar.

387
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,760
I'm sorry.

388
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,760
I forgot that Mr. Li's eyes are not good for peace.

389
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:00,760
Last night,

390
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,760
we met at Biyun's Chaosheng troupe.

391
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:04,760
Do you remember?

392
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:07,760
I remember.

393
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,760
She's Miss Xian's friend.

394
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,760
Speaking of Biyun,

395
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,760
Director Li remembered.

396
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,760
It's Director Li.

397
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:18,760
I don't know

398
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,760
how to call you.

399
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:21,760
My name is Ye Ying.

400
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24,760
I'm the director of the General Office of our password research institute.

401
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,760
I'm the wife of Director Liang.

402
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:30,760
I'm Biyun.

403
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,760
We're good friends.

404
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:35,760
How about this?

405
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,760
I'll call you Mr. Li in the future.

406
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:38,760
It'll be more quiet.

407
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,760
I'm sorry.

408
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:43,760
What's wrong?

409
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,760
Call me whatever you want.

410
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:53,760
Mr. Li,

411
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,760
the luggage is ready.

412
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:57,760
Don't stand there.

413
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,760
Let me show you the new house.

414
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,760
Come on.

415
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:11,760
This way, please.

416
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:13,760
Mr. Li,

417
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:15,760
I picked the place

418
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,760
where you live.

419
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:18,760
It's quiet.

420
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:19,760
If you can't find it,

421
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,760
please tell me.

422
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,760
What the hell?

423
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,760
It's really confusing.

424
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,760
Come in.

425
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:37,760
Mr. Li,

426
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:38,760
what's the matter?

427
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:40,760
I'm sorry.

428
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:41,760
Mr. Li,

429
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,760
there's a step ahead.

430
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:50,760
Go down.

431
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,760
Mr. Li,

432
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:03,760
the door is open.

433
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:12,760
Mr. Li,

434
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:13,760
thank you.

435
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:21,760
I'm sorry, Mr. Li.

436
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:22,760
I was in a hurry.

437
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,760
I prepared a little bit of a short story.

438
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:25,760
If you have any complaints,

439
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,760
just tell me.

440
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:32,760
Thank you, Mrs. Liang.

441
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,760
As a warrior,

442
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:36,760
I can understand

443
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:37,760
everything from the beginning.

444
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,760
Anyway,

445
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:40,760
you can stay here.

446
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,760
If you have any discomfort,

447
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:43,760
just let...

448
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:45,760
Charlie.

449
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:46,760
Charlie.

450
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:47,760
Charlie, contact me.

451
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:51,760
Mr. Li,

452
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:53,760
what's the relationship

453
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:54,760
between you and our Biyun?

454
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,760
I don't know what Miss Xian

455
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:01,760
said.

456
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:02,760
She's a woman.

457
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:03,760
How can she say that?

458
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:04,760
I just asked you.

459
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,760
As for me and Miss Xian,

460
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:10,760
how far can we go?

461
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,760
It's entirely up to her attitude.

462
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:15,760
Or else,

463
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,760
Mrs. Liang,

464
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:18,760
can you help me ask her?

465
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:20,760
Don't worry.

466
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:22,760
A man like Mr. Li

467
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,760
who is so talented and talented,

468
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:25,760
I will definitely make a good match.

469
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,760
Think about the other people in our institute.

470
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:30,760
They are all too poor.

471
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:31,760
You are a man.

472
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,760
It's not convenient to see.

473
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:34,760
You have to take care of yourself.

474
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:36,760
I feel sorry for you.

475
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,760
You are a man.

476
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:41,760
It doesn't count.

477
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:43,760
A man

478
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,760
should take care of himself

479
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:45,760
when he comes back to find a woman.

480
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:46,760
Right?

481
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,760
Professor Shen should be here.

482
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:53,760
I'll go and check.

483
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:57,760
Mr. Li, have a seat.

484
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:00,760
Charlie.

485
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,760
Mrs. Liang, take care.

486
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:15,760
Go ahead.

487
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:40,760
Go ahead.

488
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:11,760
This way.

489
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:13,760
This way.

490
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:15,760
That way.

491
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,760
Mr. Shen,

492
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:19,760
nice to meet you.

493
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:20,760
Nice to meet you.

494
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:21,760
This way, please.

495
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:23,760
This way.

496
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:26,760
Make-up.

497
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:29,760
Hurry.

498
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:31,760
Hurry.

499
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,760
There.

500
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:35,760
This way.

501
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:36,760
That's enough.

502
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:37,760
OK.

503
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:39,760
Are you ready?

504
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:41,760
OK.

505
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:42,760
OK.

506
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:43,760
Director, are you ready?

507
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:44,760
Yes, please.

508
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:46,760
OK.

509
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:47,760
Please.

510
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:48,760
Start.

511
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,760
The first round of the 12th round.

512
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:57,760
Action.

513
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:00,760
Mrs. Liang,

514
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,760
take care of yourself.

515
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:05,760
Yes.

516
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:08,760
Take care.

517
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:21,760
Move.

518
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:23,760
Move.

519
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:27,760
Mr. Li.

520
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:28,760
Get out of the way.

521
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:29,760
Mr. Li.

522
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,760
Mr. Li.

523
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:31,760
Hurry.

524
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:32,760
Mr. Li.

525
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,760
Mr. Shen, are you OK?

526
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:35,760
Mr. Shen,

527
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:36,760
bring me the towel.

528
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:37,760
Hurry.

529
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:38,760
Please.

530
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:39,760
Mr. Shen,

531
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:40,760
Mr. Shen,

532
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:41,760
please.

533
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:42,760
The next one is Mr. Shen.

534
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:48,760
This is the best.

535
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:49,760
You are the best.

536
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:50,760
Mr. Shen,

537
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:51,760
this is the best.

538
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:52,760
This is the best.

539
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:53,760
French and Chinese.

540
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,760
French is the best.

541
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:57,760
This is the best.

542
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:58,760
This is the best.

543
00:32:58,760 --> 00:32:59,760
French is the best.

544
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:00,760
This is the best.

545
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:01,760
Mr. Li,

546
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,760
nice to meet you.

547
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:03,760
This way, please.

548
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:07,760
Thank you.

549
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:10,760
Everyone,

550
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:11,760
Mr. Li is here.

551
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,760
Hello, Mr. Li.

552
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:14,760
Hello, Mr. Li.

553
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:16,760
Mr. Li,

554
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:18,760
Mr. Li,

555
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:20,760
nice to meet you.

556
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,760
I am Shen Wanqing.

557
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:23,760
This is Xiao Tu,

558
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:24,760
Li Yu, Li Huan.

559
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:25,760
Hello, Mr. Li.

560
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,760
This is the Chinese version of the novel,

561
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:28,760
Chinese and French.

562
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:30,760
Please help me with the translation.

563
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:33,760
Chinese version of the novel,

564
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:34,760
I am afraid

565
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:36,760
I can't appreciate it.

566
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,760
When you are out of the business,

567
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:41,760
I will read it for you.

568
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:45,760
I am sorry.

569
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:46,760
My mistake.

570
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:47,760
So,

571
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,760
how does Mr. Li work?

572
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,760
Charlie will help me read.

573
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:55,760
Please help me.

574
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,760
I can't see anything.

575
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:00,760
What are you talking about?

576
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:02,760
Mr. Li,

577
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:03,760
please have a seat.

578
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:04,760
Please have a seat.

579
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,760
Mr. Li, please have a seat.

580
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:09,760
Sit down.

581
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:31,760
Where is the old man?

582
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:32,760
I don't understand.

583
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:33,760
I am sorry.

584
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:35,760
Mr. Liang,

585
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,760
I am sorry.

586
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:38,760
I am sorry.

587
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:39,760
I am late again.

588
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,760
I wanted to give you a good welcome,

589
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:44,760
but I was fooled by the lock again.

590
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,760
Sit down.

591
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:47,760
Sit down.

592
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:48,760
Sit down.

593
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:52,760
Well,

594
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:55,760
I have to go.

595
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,760
I have to go.

596
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:57,760
I have to go.

597
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:58,760
I have to go.

598
00:34:58,760 --> 00:34:59,760
I have to go.

599
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:00,760
Well,

600
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:03,760
I just came from the telecom department.

601
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:06,760
Although the Shanghai Station of the military is closed,

602
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,760
their radio station is still very active.

603
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,760
For the next job,

604
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,760
I have two more seats.

605
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:15,760
Come on.

606
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:16,760
Two seats.

607
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:17,760
One for each.

608
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:18,760
One for each.

609
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,760
Okay, Mr. Liang.

610
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,760
You said you wouldn't talk about work today.

611
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:23,760
Look,

612
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,760
I made a mistake again.

613
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:25,760
I'll punish myself.

614
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:26,760
Okay?

615
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:27,760
Okay.

616
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:30,760
Well,

617
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:33,760
this wine is a welcome for you.

618
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,760
I hope you can do a good job

619
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:39,760
in the secret research institute.

620
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:40,760
Thank you, Mr. Liang.

621
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:41,760
Cheers.

622
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,760
Thank you, Mr. Liang.

623
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,760
Thank you, Mr. Liang.

624
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:45,760
Thank you, Mr. Liang.

625
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,760
Your wine is good.

626
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:49,760
You can drink it.

627
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:52,760
Cheers.

628
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:53,760
Cheers.

629
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:01,760
Sit down.

630
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,760
I'll say a few more words.

631
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,760
The most important thing in a company

632
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,760
is to be neat and tidy.

633
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,760
With the cooperation of Mr. Li,

634
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,760
we are really very happy.

635
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:22,760
Mr. Li,

636
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:25,760
let me introduce you

637
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,760
to the core members of our research institute.

638
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:34,760
This is the director of the department of

639
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,760
the Department of Rehabilitation, Director Yi.

640
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,760
Director Yi is one of the key members

641
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,760
of the secret research institute.

642
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,760
He has escaped from the world

643
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,760
and has gained the half of the Chinese

644
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:48,760
secret research world by his own efforts.

645
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:51,760
He is also the treasure of our research institute.

646
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:55,760
This is the director of the department of the department of

647
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,760
the department of Rehabilitation, Director Shen Wanqing.

648
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,760
I don't need to introduce him.

649
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,760
You just met him.

650
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,760
I'm afraid I haven't met him completely.

651
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,760
Director Shen is a famous

652
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:09,760
secret code expert.

653
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,760
This time, the Japanese military

654
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,760
has specially transferred Director Shen

655
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,760
to express their support

656
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,760
to the new government intelligence department.

657
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:20,760
Director Liang is too much.

658
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:21,760
In terms of math,

659
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,760
I can't even reach

660
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,760
Director Li and Director Yi's fur.

661
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:26,760
Okay.

662
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:27,760
You're welcome.

663
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:30,760
Those two.

664
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:31,760
Come on, kids.

665
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,760
Li Yu, Li Huan

666
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:38,760
are Director Shen's students

667
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:39,760
and siblings.

668
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,760
Director Li.

669
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:41,760
Hello, Director Li.

670
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:46,760
Dong Jinbo, Liu Fangbai, Wang Zoukai

671
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,760
are all members of Director Shen's team.

672
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:49,760
Hello, Director Li.

673
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:52,760
Teng Chou, Ma Xiaochuan.

674
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:53,760
Hello, Director Li.

675
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:54,760
Hello, Director Li.

676
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,760
I'm Director Yi's team member.

677
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:59,760
He's also the center of our research institute.

678
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:01,760
Okay.

679
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,760
To welcome Director Li,

680
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:04,760
let's have a toast

681
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:07,760
with our colleague, Qiao Qian Sanyangli.

682
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:12,760
Cheers.

683
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:13,760
Thank you.

684
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:15,760
Director Li.

685
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:26,760
Okay, thank you.

686
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:27,760
Come on, Director Li.

687
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,760
One more, one more.

688
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:41,760
I'm so happy

689
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:44,760
that you got rid of the math problem.

690
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,760
It's our honor.

691
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:47,760
Okay.

692
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:48,760
Come on, come on.

693
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:49,760
You know,

694
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,760
we're looking forward to your work.

695
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:54,760
I have a bottle of wine here.

696
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:55,760
It's from a British friend.

697
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:56,760
I don't understand.

698
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:57,760
Help me open it.

699
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:00,760
I need you to come back more often.

700
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:02,760
No problem, Director Liu.

701
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,760
Shallow Ghost Desto Hanella.

702
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:10,760
Director Liu,

703
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:13,760
this wine is from the French Bordeaux case.

704
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:14,760
It's not very edible.

705
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,760
Louis Gaspard Desto Hanella

706
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:18,760
was established in the early century.

707
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:19,760
And Coase

708
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:22,760
is one of the small people in France.

709
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:23,760
This is also the place

710
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,760
where the wine is stored.

711
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:28,760
French.

712
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:30,760
French.

713
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:45,760
Director Yang,

714
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:46,760
I think

715
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:49,760
it's better to use the old wine

716
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,760
than the wine.

717
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,760
Otherwise, the wine will break in the bottle.

718
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,760
Come on, come on.

719
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:58,760
It seems that the old wine

720
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:00,760
is really not open enough.

721
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:02,760
Director Liu, please forgive me.

722
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:04,760
My parents

723
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:06,760
are the chief editor of the Zilin Xibao

724
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,760
and the Chinese chef of Mr. Mike Lann.

725
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,760
Congratulations, Director Li.

726
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:11,760
Mr. Mike's etiquette

727
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,760
is very particular.

728
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,760
And they have a lot of old wine.

729
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:17,760
I also learned a lot

730
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,760
from Mike Lann at that time.

731
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:21,760
So,

732
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,760
it's because I had the experience

733
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:23,760
when I was a kid

734
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,760
that I could take care of Mr. Li.

735
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,760
I know this Mike Lann.

736
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,760
He is a British entertainment reporter.

737
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:34,760
Director Yang,

738
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:36,760
if I remember correctly,

739
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:39,760
Mr. Mike Lann is an actual reporter.

740
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:42,760
His house is in...

741
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:43,760
In the East Road.

742
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,760
The other side is the three-legged field.

743
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:48,760
I haven't had time

744
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:49,760
to go back

745
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,760
to see Mr. Li these days.

746
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:52,760
I don't know if the changes

747
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:53,760
around there are big or not.

748
00:40:58,760 --> 00:40:59,760
Great job.

749
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:02,760
Director Yang,

750
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,760
this wine is loved by the royal family.

751
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,760
Fortunately, I didn't lose face

752
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,760
in front of you today.

753
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:14,760
Charlie,

754
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:16,760
I didn't expect you to leave Shanghai

755
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:17,760
for so long

756
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:20,760
and remember so many old places.

757
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:23,760
No wonder

758
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,760
you can take Mr. Li

759
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:28,760
from the hands of the first-class team.

760
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:31,760
Director Yang,

761
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:34,760
Mr. Li is a smart man.

762
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:37,760
Director Yang,

763
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:40,760
Charlie is just an assistant.

764
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:42,760
It's not worth

765
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,760
wasting your time on him.

766
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:48,760
Director Li,

767
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,760
Charlie and I

768
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:51,760
are quite close.

769
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,760
I envy you.

770
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:58,760
When can I find

771
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:01,760
such a good assistant?

772
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:11,760
Mr. Li!

773
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,760
It's Miss Xian Biyun.

774
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:15,760
Biyun.

775
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:16,760
Don't be afraid.

776
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:18,760
I'm going to die.

777
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:21,760
What's wrong, Biyun?

778
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:22,760
Chong Tian Feng.

779
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:27,760
Biyun.

780
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:29,760
Don't cry.

781
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:30,760
Charlie.

782
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:34,760
What happened?

783
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:36,760
What happened?

784
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:38,760
What happened?

785
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:39,760
What happened?

786
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:41,760
Mr. Li

787
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:42,760
and his students

788
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:43,760
went to the theater

789
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:44,760
to make trouble

790
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:46,760
for Biyun's daughter-in-law.

791
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:48,760
They called her a traitor.

792
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:49,760
It's ridiculous.

793
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:50,760
How could this happen?

794
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:52,760
Don't.

795
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:56,760
They told me

796
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:58,760
if I was in the film,

797
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:00,760
they would kill me.

798
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:03,760
The troupe was surrounded.

799
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:06,760
I became the center of attention.

800
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:07,760
But my brother

801
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:09,760
hurt him.

802
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,760
How could I be the center of attention?

803
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:18,760
Charlie.

804
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:20,760
It's all my fault.

805
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:23,760
It's all my fault.

806
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:24,760
It's all my fault.

807
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:41,760
Five years earlier

808
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:13,760
When the sun rises, the first light will dance for me

809
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:20,760
Home is lost, no direction, no way out

810
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:27,760
Pain in the eyes, people who pretend to be real don't know

811
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:34,760
Where the wind is going, who's window is shaking, the sound of the doorbell

812
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:41,760
The heart is thinking, or you or I am feeling

813
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:48,760
He is watching, the vast night

814
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:55,760
Tears are flowing, a bunch of broken wounds

815
00:44:55,760 --> 00:45:02,760
He is watching, wandering in the shadow

816
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:09,760
The night falls, looking back, it's already the end of the world

817
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:31,760
Home is lost, no direction, no way out

818
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:39,760
Pain in the eyes, people who pretend to be real don't know

819
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:46,760
Where the wind is going, who's window is shaking, the sound of the doorbell

820
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:53,760
The heart is thinking, or you or I am feeling

821
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:59,760
He is watching, the vast night
