By¿¦ le?

34
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:18,040
Let's introduce ourselves as the Committee of The Nationaloni

35
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:18,700
and the Sang dużrisei

36
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:22,260
to end this discussions

37
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,020
everyone on your pedestal

38
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:27,820
And love song.

39
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:53,960
Can a

40
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,960
I've been keeping my mouth shut for years.

41
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,960
I have nothing to say.

42
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,960
But you don't have to be so reckless.

43
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,960
You know very well what kind of person Liang Juren is.

44
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,960
Working with him is like fighting a fire.

45
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,960
I'll give you a little bit of the sauce.

46
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,960
I'll give you a little bit of the sauce.

47
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:32,960
Liang Juren is really good at playing hard to get.

48
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:37,960
I didn't expect that the Green Scent Committee gave him a position as a member.

49
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:43,960
If you have a wife who is willing to pay for her family's funeral,

50
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:45,960
you'll climb faster than her.

51
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:46,960
You're faster than her.

52
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:53,960
Hello, Director Li.

53
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:55,960
Hello, Director Li.

54
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,960
Director Lin and the committee members are all here.

55
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:00,960
Director Lin.

56
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:02,960
Please don't kill him.

57
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,960
This is the chief of the Green Scent Committee,

58
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:11,960
the chief of the Green Scent Committee,

59
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,960
and the chief of the Green Scent Committee.

60
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:21,960
Director An Jing,

61
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,960
it's a great honor to meet you.

62
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:32,960
Brother,

63
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,960
my name is Kanegane.

64
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,960
I've been working with Taiko for a long time.

65
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,960
He often talked about you when he was a chief of staff.

66
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,960
I didn't expect to meet you here.

67
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,960
Would you like to talk a little?

68
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:05,960
I'll talk about the past with only you and Li.

69
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:08,960
Please.

70
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:12,960
Please.

71
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:31,960
Mr. Komizu,

72
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,960
since there is a translator by the chief of staff,

73
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,960
you don't have to follow me.

74
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:40,960
Okay, Director Li.

75
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:42,960
Thank you.

76
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:04,960
I will help you.

77
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:12,960
Cheers.

78
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:29,960
Let's talk.

79
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,960
Cheers.

80
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:42,960
Cheers.

81
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,960
When did Brother Liang call me out?

82
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:07,960
I saw it just now.

83
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,960
I didn't let you in.

84
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:12,960
What does it mean?

85
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,960
It means you have a different mind.

86
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:19,960
I'm used to it.

87
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:21,960
I'm the chief.

88
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,960
It's strange that Director An Jing

89
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:28,960
suddenly came here.

90
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,960
It seems that Director An Jing is the chief of staff of the Green Scent Committee.

91
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:36,960
In fact,

92
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,960
he is here to investigate the secret and secret secrets

93
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,960
of the people in the space.

94
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,960
Li Yue Se is the spy.

95
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,960
Brother Liang,

96
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,960
you are going to kill Mr. Li.

97
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,960
But as far as I know,

98
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:01,960
An Jing Zhong and Du Yue Si are old friends.

99
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,960
Will he give them a chance?

100
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,960
Don't talk about you.

101
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,960
I said we were friends.

102
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,960
Let me tell you this.

103
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:16,960
Du Yue Si is good friends with An Jing Zhong.

104
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:22,960
But he has always been in the middle of the conflict between the Eastern Yuan Temple and the Eastern Tiao Sect.

105
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:23,960
Moreover,

106
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:26,960
he has been the ambassador of the camp for so many years.

107
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,960
His family business is all in London.

108
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,960
Once he fights with the British and the Americans,

109
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,960
he is the first one to be hurt.

110
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,960
Moreover, he has been in bed for a year.

111
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,960
It's important to wake up.

112
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,960
So,

113
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,960
is the Eastern Yuan Temple family

114
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,960
a life-saving or a death-saving family to Li Yue Se?

115
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,960
What do you think?

116
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,960
Please give me your advice.

117
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,960
This is a letter from the British.

118
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,960
I have written the content for you.

119
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,960
With your identity and your statement,

120
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,960
the British and British people know Li Yue Se and have a secret relationship.

121
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,960
You need to write the letter.

122
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,960
But if I am here to ask you,

123
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,960
I will be the first one to be hurt.

124
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,960
I will be the first one to be hurt.

125
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,960
I will be the first one to be hurt.

126
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,960
I will be the first one to be hurt.

127
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,960
If you sign the letter,

128
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,960
Mr. Li will be dead.

129
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:42,960
I want to ask you.

130
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,960
You always think for him.

131
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,960
But have you ever thought for him?

132
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:46,960
Has he ever thought for you?

133
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,960
If Li Yue Se has always been the head of the secret research institute,

134
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,960
will he keep you under his control?

135
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:52,960
Do you think so?

136
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,960
As long as you sign the letter,

137
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,960
the general will sign it for you on the letter.

138
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:04,960
By then, you will be the secret inspector of the Green House Committee.

139
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,960
The Left Palace is your tree.

140
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,960
Don't say a secret code.

141
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,960
All your talents

142
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,960
will not be seen.

143
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,960
The secret inspector of the Green House Committee

144
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,960
What did An Jing say to you?

145
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,960
What did An Jing say to you?

146
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,960
The Green House Committee has adopted the secret code designed by her.

147
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,960
And the one you designed has been returned by Nanjing.

148
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:36,960
Do you know?

149
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:42,960
She said that you gave the Japanese a very secret code behind my back.

150
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:49,960
It seems that your new protector is very powerful.

151
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,960
But I still want to remind you.

152
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,960
Even if the Green House Committee uses your secret code,

153
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:08,960
we will not give up.

154
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,960
I'd better remind you again.

155
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,960
Don't trust Liang Jing Yuan too much.

156
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:29,960
I understand.

157
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:34,960
I understand.

158
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:39,960
I understand.

159
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:44,960
I understand.

160
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,960
I understand.

161
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:53,960
I understand.

162
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:57,960
I understand.

163
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:01,960
I understand.

164
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,960
The secret inspector of the Green House Committee

165
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:26,960
Now, use numbers 1 to 10 to express your strength.

166
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:28,960
1

167
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:32,960
You don't feel anything at all.

168
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:34,960
10

169
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:37,960
You have a very strong sense.

170
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:39,960
Let's start.

171
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:44,960
How about it?

172
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:48,960
2

173
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:49,960
Or

174
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,960
3

175
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:53,960
I understand.

176
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:55,960
How about this?

177
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:57,960
5

178
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:12,960
How about this?

179
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:16,960
5

180
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:20,960
3

181
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:23,960
Less than 100 meters away.

182
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:28,960
He has to walk for 10 minutes at the travel price.

183
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:30,960
It's been so long.

184
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,960
Why can't he recover?

185
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:39,960
I can feel the wound on Sen-san's spine.

186
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:45,960
But the recovery of the spinal nerve is slower than usual.

187
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:47,960
However,

188
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:56,960
it is a miracle that he got off the bed in her spinal nerve state.

189
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:58,960
However,

190
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:06,960
let's encourage him to strengthen his recovery training.

191
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:09,960
Take your time.

192
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,960
Then, I'm going to go.

193
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:15,960
Goodbye.

194
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:19,960
I'll send them off.

195
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:35,960
Take your time.

196
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:51,960
Is it really that important who is in charge of the top floor?

197
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:52,960
It's only your mother's risk.

198
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:54,960
Don't worry about me.

199
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:55,960
I'll find out the result.

200
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,960
I have a way out.

201
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,960
How's it going on your side?

202
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:08,960
The password plan the organization gave me has been handed over to Nanjing.

203
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:12,960
In a few days, the Qingxiao Committee will formally use our password.

204
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,960
But I still feel a little bit unstable.

205
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,960
It's always good to be cautious.

206
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:20,960
But remember, don't put too much pressure on yourself.

207
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,960
Our top floor is the base of the base.

208
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:29,960
The Chinese and Chinese troops of the Kuomintang have all been drawn into the important scope of this Qingxiao.

209
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:32,960
Only by mastering the password of the Qingxiao Committee's secret power station

210
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,960
can we understand the work of the Uyghur Qingxiao.

211
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,960
In my understanding of Guoyangshan,

212
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,960
he will not give up.

213
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,960
After the war in Banan, the Uyghur was already a general.

214
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,960
For the past half a year, your efforts to fight the Uyghur army

215
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,960
and the civil war between Liang and Guoyangshan have suffered a lot.

216
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,960
But they have also accumulated a lot of experience.

217
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,960
These two people are very rich.

218
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,960
It's not easy to form an alliance.

219
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:09,960
So I guess they will have the next move soon.

220
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:11,960
We can't sit and wait.

221
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,960
We must send someone to kick Guoyangshan out.

222
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,960
The organization sent a secret expert to support me.

223
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,960
When can I come in?

224
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,960
The background investigation of the research institute

225
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,960
is now under the responsibility of the head of the institute.

226
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:26,960
It's very strict.

227
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,960
We have prepared for several months.

228
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,960
The identity and disguise of the expert has just been solved these days.

229
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,960
After you go back, find a chance to request

230
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,960
to send a new secret agent.

231
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,960
He will find a way to get to you.

232
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,960
It's time to say goodbye.

233
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,960
Slow down.

234
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,960
Be careful.

235
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:24,960
Tell Xiao,

236
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,960
the replacement of the key to the reception of the Uyghur People's Committee

237
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,960
has been completed.

238
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,960
The expert we have assigned to him

239
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,960
can enter the secret agent at any time.

240
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:34,960
Okay.

241
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,960
But what should you do?

242
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:40,960
You alone...

243
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:45,960
I will go.

244
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,960
If the information is correct,

245
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,960
the suspect is the first target

246
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,960
of the heart and brain blood vessels.

247
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:15,960
The patient living in the upper floor

248
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,960
has this kind of acupoint to wake him up.

249
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,960
He must be an important figure in the Japanese military.

250
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:23,960
I suspect

251
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,960
it's the Uyghur people.

252
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:27,960
But

253
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,960
the Japanese military's senior

254
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,960
has heart and brain blood vessels.

255
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,960
Not only him.

256
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,960
Why do you suspect him?

257
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,960
The Uyghur people are the Uyghur people.

258
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,960
Now the relationship between Japan and the Uyghur people is so tense.

259
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,960
In this situation,

260
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,960
do you dare to use the Uyghur people?

261
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,960
Besides the Uyghur people

262
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,960
who have been working in the Western-style East Garden for years,

263
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,960
who else will?

264
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,960
But based on the information we received

265
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,960
some time ago,

266
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,960
this job

267
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,960
is still in the hands of the Japanese people.

268
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,960
The Uyghur people

269
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,960
are still in the hands of the Japanese people.

270
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,960
The Uyghur people

271
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,960
are still in the hands of the Japanese people.

272
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,960
Ding Yi mentioned

273
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,960
that they received a private radio

274
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,960
from the secret station.

275
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,960
Do you remember?

276
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,960
Yes.

277
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,960
Ding Yi told us the frequency

278
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,960
and the time of the radio.

279
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,960
It's a good thing.

280
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,960
Actually, this is the private radio of Zuo Zuo Mu.

281
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,960
But

282
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,960
it doesn't matter who lives upstairs.

283
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,960
Zuo Zuo Mu

284
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,960
is the representative of the Shaozhuang Sect

285
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,960
and the representative of the Eastern Garden.

286
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,960
He is the heir of the four families.

287
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,960
After the work of the other party's

288
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,960
is completed,

289
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,960
I believe the secret message of the radio

290
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,960
will tell us

291
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,960
who the patient

292
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,960
who lives on the top floor is.

293
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,960
Who is it?

294
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,960
I have to sign the contract

295
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,960
to be the chief executive?

296
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,960
You can write the contract as a secret agent.

297
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,960
Sign the contract?

298
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,960
That idiot wants to sign it.

299
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,960
What can he do?

300
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,960
Lin, the board of directors has been established.

301
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,960
When will we move there?

302
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,960
I don't know.

303
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,960
You don't know?

304
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,960
You don't know?

305
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,960
The committee of the

306
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,960
Qingjiang Committee is a false name.

307
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,960
Am I reading a newspaper?

308
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,960
I'm reading the future.

309
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,960
The future?

310
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,960
The house has been replaced.

311
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,960
But you are all

312
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,960
as bad as the tofu.

313
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,960
You have to take charge.

314
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,960
You have to take charge.

315
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,960
You are so old.

316
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,960
We have to fight for this.

317
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,960
What do you want?

318
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,960
It's done.

319
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,960
Don't touch me.

320
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,960
Don't cry.

321
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,960
Do I want to be an official?

322
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,960
I'm trying to find

323
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,960
a sense of security for us.

324
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,960
But you know

325
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,960
what's going on now.

326
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,960
We are both

327
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,960
trying to survive in the gap.

328
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,960
People

329
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,960
have their own difficulties.

330
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,960
They get over it

331
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,960
and become more and more cheerful.

332
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,960
What do you want?

333
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,960
The chief executive called me

334
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,960
to send a new secretary to Li Yunsi.

335
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,960
Do you know?

336
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,960
Is this news accurate?

337
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,960
He just called.

338
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,960
That's great.

339
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,960
Don't say it.

340
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,960
You can't tell me about it.

341
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,960
I know.

342
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,960
Secretary Gu.

343
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,960
You have to get

344
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,960
the new secretary in.

345
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,960
And post his

346
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,960
report in our office.

347
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,960
The chief executive

348
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,960
has to be in charge

349
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,960
of the new secretary.

350
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,960
The personnel is never

351
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,960
an official.

352
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,960
It's not just about the official.

353
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,960
I want the head of the department.

354
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,960
I have to show

355
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,960
everyone in our office.

356
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,960
What are you going to do?

357
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,960
Give me a leg.

358
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,960
A leg?

359
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,960
I'll write it in English.

360
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,960
Last month, the foreign affairs

361
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,960
negotiations with the UK and the US were very bad.

362
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,960
So the Japanese have hired

363
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,960
a special person to investigate

364
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,960
the intelligence agency of the new government.

365
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,960
Li Yuese

366
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,960
has a deep connection with the UK and the US.

367
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,960
So once the war begins,

368
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,960
he will be fired.

369
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,960
Ding Yi is a

370
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,960
county man.

371
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,960
He is there to cover you.

372
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,960
Once the cover is broken,

373
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,960
he will be fired.

374
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,960
As long as you are still in the research institute,

375
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,960
you are there.

376
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,960
I am going to use the Japanese

377
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,960
to investigate the intelligence agency of the UK and the US.

378
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,960
I will report to Li Yuese

379
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,960
and the UK and the US

380
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,960
to the state.

381
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,960
Then Ding Yi will be fired.

382
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,960
And I will stay

383
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,960
and carry out the mission.

384
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,960
Liang Jinyuan has been

385
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,960
pulling you down.

386
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,960
He hates Li Yuese.

387
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,960
You can sign

388
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,960
the letter he gave you

389
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,960
and hand it over to him.

390
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,960
I will

391
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,960
but I will write

392
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,960
this letter myself.

393
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,960
I understand what you mean.

394
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,960
You just want to

395
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,960
get hold of the letter

396
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,960
and get Ding Yi out alive.

397
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,960
But who is Liang Jinyuan?

398
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,960
He can't guess it.

399
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,960
To save Ding Yi,

400
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,960
Liang Jinyuan

401
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,960
lost his trust in you.

402
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,960
Hu Yangshan,

403
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,960
I advise you to focus on the big picture.

404
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,960
Don't be emotional.

405
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,960
I will.

406
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,960
An, I understand what you mean.

407
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,960
But you have to know

408
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,960
that Ding Yi is

409
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,960
a big trouble to us.

410
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,960
So if we push him too hard,

411
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,960
it will affect our next action.

412
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,960
So I have my plans.

413
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,960
You just

414
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,960
report to me

415
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,960
as I want.

416
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,960
Mr. Li,

417
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,960
you are going home.

418
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,960
Mr. Gu,

419
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,960
it's you.

420
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,960
Mr. Gu,

421
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,960
congratulations.

422
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,960
Mr. Li,

423
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,960
it's you.

424
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,960
Congratulations.

425
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,960
Mr. Li,

426
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,960
I see.

427
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,960
Mr. Gu,

428
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,960
congratulations.

429
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,960
Congratulations.

430
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,960
Congratulations.

431
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,960
You are so good.

432
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,960
Congratulations.

433
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,960
See you tomorrow.

434
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,960
Congratulations.

435
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,960
Congratulations.

436
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,960
Mr. Gu,

437
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,960
you are transferred to the Green House Committee.

438
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,960
Congratulations.

439
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,960
Congratulations.

440
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,960
You are transferred to the Green House Committee.

441
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,960
You are transferred to my position.

442
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,960
I really underestimated you.

443
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,960
I thought he was just a fake.

444
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,960
I didn't expect

445
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,960
that he really had some power.

446
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,960
But I'm curious about

447
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,960
his future with his wife.

448
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,960
And you,

449
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,960
what did you do?

450
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,960
The new secretary that the Red Cross recruited for you

451
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,960
should be here tomorrow.

452
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,960
I will work with him as soon as possible.

453
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,960
From now on,

454
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,960
we will separate.

455
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,960
I won't change.

456
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,960
You want to replace the Green House Committee?

457
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,960
I won't let you go.

458
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,960
I won't let you go.

459
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,960
Thank you.

460
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,960
Please come with us.

461
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,960
I'm sorry.

462
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,960
Gu Ruoyuan.

463
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,960
Gu Ruoyuan.

464
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,960
Gu Ruoyuan.

465
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,960
This way.

466
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,960
Gu Ruoyuan.

467
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,960
Gu Ruoyuan.

468
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,960
This way.

469
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,960
Please come with us.

470
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,960
Yes.

471
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,960
Mr. Qiao Benpailang,

472
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,960
the team leader of the password development team.

473
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,960
The key password of our committee

474
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,960
is his design.

475
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,960
His design?

476
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,960
Yes.

477
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,960
But as far as I know,

478
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,960
Nanjing

479
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,960
uses Mr. Li Yuese's password.

480
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,960
I don't know

481
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,960
the specific reason.

482
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,960
But we always use the password of Qiao Benpailang.

483
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,960
The password of the team leader.

484
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,960
Your office is here.

485
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,960
The team leader of the team development team

486
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,960
hasn't arrived yet.

487
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,960
I'll introduce him to you when he arrives.

488
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,960
The team development team?

489
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,960
Yes.

490
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,960
Gu Ruoyuan, didn't you just say

491
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,960
you have something to give to Mr. Suo.

492
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,960
No hurry.

493
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,960
Mr. Suo,

494
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,960
this is the daily work plan.

495
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,960
Is Mr. Liang here?

496
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,960
Mr. Liang hasn't arrived yet.

497
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,960
What's the matter?

498
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,960
Nothing.

499
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,960
Please go ahead.

500
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,960
You дыis here.

501
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,960
I told you he didn't.

502
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,960
I told you he doesn't.

503
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,960
You had better be careful.

504
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:30,240
Chen Ren

505
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,240
Wait.

506
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:36,240
Mr. Liang.

507
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,240
Just call me Liang.

508
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,240
I'm going to see Mr. Liang.

509
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,240
There are some things I don't understand.

510
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:45,240
I want to ask Mr. Liang to explain to me.

511
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,240
Say it.

512
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:50,240
Why does the Qingjiang Committee use Qiao Ben's password?

513
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:54,240
And why am I arranged into the Phe Clan?

514
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:57,240
Your promise to me is as disappointing as ever.

515
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,240
I'm sorry.

516
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:03,240
The Phe Clan

517
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:30,240
Zuo Zoumu has handed the letter you wrote to the Anqing Zhong family.

518
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,240
He was very angry after reading it.

519
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,240
Let me tell you.

520
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:36,240
Li Yuese will die this time.

521
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:38,240
As long as he is dead this time,

522
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,240
you will be the director of the password research institute.

523
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:45,240
Why do you care about a mere password specialist?

524
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:48,240
What do you say?

525
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:55,240
I know what you're thinking.

526
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,240
Your letter of resignation

527
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:01,240
is not evidence that Li Yuese has been secretly working for Yingmei.

528
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,240
It's not important.

529
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:06,240
What's important is this letter of resignation.

530
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:10,240
It's Li Yuese's suicide note.

531
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:12,240
Mr. Li.

532
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:14,240
I'm sure you know this.

533
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:18,240
All the statements here are recorded.

534
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:21,240
The general is in the military.

535
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,240
It's a disaster.

536
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,240
According to Japanese military intelligence,

537
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,240
he is dead.

538
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,240
What do you mean?

539
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,240
Do you think Zuo Zoumu has a big circle

540
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:37,240
just to get rid of a blind man?

541
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,240
Of course not.

542
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:45,240
You have a message that you have the right to own the secret code design business of the new government.

543
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,240
Is it the order of the Toen case?

544
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,240
He wants to use Li Yuese

545
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:56,240
to get the hat of the Toen family from the Toen family.

546
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,240
It's a nonsense.

547
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,240
This is all Zixun's doing.

548
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,240
I don't know anything.

549
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,240
Once this is done,

550
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:09,240
no one will ever fight against the Toen family again.

551
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,240
In the last Chuei era,

552
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:18,240
your father and his classmates were frequently involved in the Toen case.

553
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:26,240
What kind of British did you meet in the Toen family?

554
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:30,240
Daguang is the ambassador of the Toen family appointed by His Majesty.

555
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:32,240
He has always been loyal to His Majesty.

556
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:36,240
He has never had any contact with any English-born people other than work.

557
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:40,240
Moreover, he invited people to his home in private.

558
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,240
Mr. Anjing, you can suspect me,

559
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:47,240
but you should never suspect Daguang.

560
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:55,240
Brother, you should be glad

561
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:59,240
that you have this knife to prove your loyalty.

562
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:03,240
You should keep your eyes on the long term.

563
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:15,240
So I want to thank you for your advice

564
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:19,240
and for bringing me out of this political whirlpool.

565
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,240
Dad,

566
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,240
don't forget that we are friends.

567
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,240
Why do you say that?

568
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:31,240
I and Mr. Zuo really admire you.

569
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,240
There are so many talented people like you.

570
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:36,240
Don't let anyone down.

571
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,240
Mr. Li,

572
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,240
while we investigate the case thoroughly,

573
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:28,240
we will stop the work at the secret research institute

574
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:32,240
and wait for the judgment to be made.

《花蜜蜂》

596
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:36,240
火一支毒物 破碎的拉脫這溫度

597
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:43,240
紅透過眼光 搖曳那微弱的一盞烏中

598
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:50,240
花 捧起爪路 俊烈的身距化成泥土

599
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:57,240
能 天邊日出 第一綠光輝替我起舞

600
00:43:57,240 --> 00:44:04,240
家 隔著迷霧 沒有方向也沒有退路

601
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:11,240
在眼下痛哭 假的戲真的人說不清楚

602
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:19,240
風 去往何處 搖晃著誰的窗 低聲的訴

603
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:26,240
心 傻傻坐下 或是你或是我在干擾

604
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:33,240
他在守望 茫茫遠夜上

605
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:40,240
一瞬風光 一軍跌的傷

606
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:47,240
他在守望 陰影裡流浪

607
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:54,240
夜色落幕 回舟也是天涼

608
00:44:54,240 --> 00:45:01,240
他在守望 茫茫遠夜上

609
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:08,240
淚水風光 一軍跌的傷

610
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:16,240
他在守望 陰影裡流浪

611
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:23,240
夜色落幕 回舟也是天涼

612
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:32,240
夜色落幕 回舟也是天涼
