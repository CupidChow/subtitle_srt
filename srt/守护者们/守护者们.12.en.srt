00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The Long Ballad

2
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Episode 10

3
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Old Wu, what do you think?

4
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Bi Yun, the organization believes

5
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
that since the case has been closed,

6
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
they will definitely relax their guard against this place.

7
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
So, this place is safer.

8
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
The organization hopes that we can stay here.

9
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Also, the organization's plan for us

10
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
is fully confirmed.

11
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
And it will continue to increase the number of people.

12
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
But, I personally think

13
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
that I am still a little worried about

14
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
working with Gu Yangshan.

15
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I will take care of it.

16
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Hello, who are you looking for?

17
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Oh, wait a minute.

18
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Gu Yangshan.

19
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Hello.

20
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Hello, I am here.

21
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Charlie.

22
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Let me introduce.

23
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
This is Frank,

24
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
the vice president of the Vanguoshan Group.

25
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
This is Charlie.

26
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I am here to see Mr. Li.

27
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Wow, Miss Shen has told me so much about you.

28
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Pleasure to meet you.

29
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Nice to meet you.

30
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Please have a seat.

31
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I know just your London accent is quite standard.

32
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Have you ever been to London before?

33
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Yeah, I started in London before.

34
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Of course.

35
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
And what did you study there?

36
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Oh, math.

37
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Math, I know.

38
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
It's a really difficult subject.

39
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I know math is never my strong point.

40
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Frank, thank you for coming today.

41
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Okay, no problem.

42
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
So we're done here?

43
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Yeah.

44
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Finished?

45
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Finished.

46
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Finished.

47
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
See you next time.

48
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Bye.

49
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Now there is a more exciting experience.

50
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
After Wu Tian came out of the Navy Club,

51
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
he went to the German doctor, Schwartz.

52
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
He is a famous brain surgeon in Europe.

53
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
As far as I know,

54
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
he is also the only one in Shanghai who has the knowledge

55
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
of the brain-stretching technique.

56
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I think Wu Tian went to see him

57
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
because he got Li Yue Se's medical certificate.

58
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
And then he went to the German doctor

59
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
to be a medical doctor.

60
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Li Yue Se's world-class nerves

61
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
are the cause of the brain pressure.

62
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Miss Xia, if you really

63
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
can find the brain-stretching technique

64
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
from the doctor you talked about,

65
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
we don't have to wait until tomorrow.

66
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
We'll be there soon.

67
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Yes.

68
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Actually, you don't take the consequences

69
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
and use that poison to destroy his brain.

70
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
But you can't make

71
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
the same kind of tumor.

72
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Miss Xia, don't worry.

73
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I won't let anyone

74
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
do this to him.

75
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I don't mean to force you.

76
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I just think

77
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
at the critical moment,

78
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
you and Guiyang Mountain can use it.

79
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Guiyang Mountain

80
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
This is where I work.

81
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I'll be here during the day.

82
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
You can come to me anytime.

83
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Miss Xia,

84
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
maybe I have another way.

85
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Guiyang Mountain

86
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
The case of Miyamoto's case

87
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
is indeed unexpected.

88
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
But Wu Tian exposed

89
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
his relationship with the navy.

90
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Judging from Lin's reaction,

91
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
maybe Mr. Zuo doesn't know about this.

92
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Guiyang Mountain

93
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
The navy is in conflict.

94
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
If we tell this to Mr. Zuo,

95
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
as long as he has doubts,

96
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
we'll have a chance.

97
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Hi, good afternoon.

98
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Hello, do you have an appointment?

99
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Actually, I'm looking for Dr. Mok.

100
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
He's talking to a friend.

101
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
He's coming to pick up the suit.

102
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Okay, sure.

103
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Thank you.

104
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Guiyang Mountain

105
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
The navy has discovered a kind of

106
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
nerve toxin.

107
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
As long as it's around your eyes,

108
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
you'll be able to detect it.

109
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
In less than five minutes,

110
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
you can completely destroy

111
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
its visual nerves.

112
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Lin Jie

113
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
This is for you.

114
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Yan Qing, this is for you.

115
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
The purple cherry blossoms will be

116
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
offered after they are dried.

117
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
But when it's dry,

118
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
it can't be hung directly on the window.

119
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
The sunlight will make it discolored.

120
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
It should be dried completely

121
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
before it can be seen.

122
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Guiyang Mountain

123
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I've been looking for you

124
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
for so long.

125
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I thought you'd forgotten.

126
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Mr. Charlie

127
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Charlie

128
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Thank you.

129
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Yan Qing

130
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
The purple cherry blossoms will be

131
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
offered after they are dried.

132
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
The sunlight will make it discolored.

133
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
It should be dried completely

134
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
before it can be seen.

135
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
It's really you.

136
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Brother Shi Xian.

137
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
It's been a long time.

138
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
You've grown up.

139
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I didn't expect that

140
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
we'd meet again

141
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
after so many years.

142
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Actually, I recognized you

143
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
when we went to the dance party that day.

144
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Why didn't you recognize me?

145
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
It's a long story.

146
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I'll explain it to you another day.

147
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Today?

148
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Let's sit down and talk.

149
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Okay.

150
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Don't bother.

151
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Actually, I came today

152
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
to ask you for a favor.

153
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
My friend

154
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
has a congenital hemorrhage.

155
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
He has a severe headache

156
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
and his vision is weak.

157
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Congenital hemorrhage?

158
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Yes.

159
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Dr. Schwartz is an expert in this.

160
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
If he doesn't mind,

161
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
he can come to the hospital.

162
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I heard that

163
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
the damage to the body

164
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
is great

165
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
after the examination,

166
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
right?

167
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Yes.

168
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
The brain blood vessels

169
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
are not affected

170
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
and the congenital hemorrhage

171
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
is a congenital surgery.

172
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
The doctor requires a very high level of surgery.

173
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
The technology is not mature enough.

174
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
So many patients who

175
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
have been tested for this

176
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
may have permanent

177
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
nervous dysfunction.

178
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
So

179
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
unless the patient is in critical condition

180
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
and needs an operation,

181
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
we don't recommend

182
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
the examination.

183
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
But you got the right person.

184
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Dr. Schwartz is the only person

185
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
who can do this test in Shanghai.

186
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Then

187
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
if my friend

188
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
doesn't want to do this test,

189
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
but someone forces him to do it,

190
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
will you agree?

191
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Forced?

192
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Yes.

193
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Of course not.

194
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
We have to respect

195
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
the will of the patient.

196
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
If his body is not allowed,

197
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
this test cannot be done.

198
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
What if

199
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
someone forces you?

200
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
No.

201
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
This is the professional ethics

202
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
of our doctors.

203
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
But now

204
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
someone forces this friend

205
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
to come to your clinic

206
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
and ask Dr. Schwartz

207
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
to do this test.

208
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Your friend

209
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
is the man

210
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
who was busy

211
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
on the night of the night?

212
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Yes.

213
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
And his medical records

214
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
should have been sent

215
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
to your clinic.

216
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Chief Wu Tian

217
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
sent a medical record

218
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
here.

219
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
His name is

220
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Li...

221
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Li Yue Se.

222
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
It's Mr. Li.

223
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Oh.

224
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
No wonder.

225
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Dr. Schwartz

226
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
felt strange

227
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
at that time.

228
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Why did the patient

229
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
have a successful

230
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
brain blood vessel

231
00:12:46,000 --> 00:13:03,520
and had a

232
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
cancer?

233
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
We will not

234
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
check Mr. Li

235
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
tomorrow.

236
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
If I were the leader,

237
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
of course I would.

238
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
But I can't be

239
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
the leader of Dr. Schwartz.

240
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Dr. Schwartz

241
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
never wants to offend

242
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
the Japanese.

243
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I'm just

244
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
his student.

245
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I'm afraid I can't control him.

246
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Yuyi!

247
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Haoyue!

248
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Shanyue!

249
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Shanyue!

250
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Shanyue!

251
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Shanyue!

252
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Shanyue!

253
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Shanyue!

254
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Shanyue!

255
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Shanyue!

256
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Shanyue!

257
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Give it back to me!

258
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
What are you doing? Are you crazy?

259
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
What can I do? Tell me what can I do now?

260
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
So, now you understand, right?

261
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
The most important thing is to check this.

262
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
You should check this carefully.

263
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
So, Miss Qingmei,

264
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
did she tell you

265
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
what to do

266
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
to keep them from checking my place?

267
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
She did.

268
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Use this.

269
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Shanyue!

270
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Welcome.

271
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
The doctor has arrived.

272
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Good morning.

273
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
The brain blood vessels are in danger.

274
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
We need to do a full examination for the patient.

275
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Please wait patiently.

276
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Mr. Li, I'll go out first.

277
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Okay.

278
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I'll put the blood pressure test on your arm.

279
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I'll test your blood pressure tomorrow.

280
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I'll make sure the doctor doesn't check you.

281
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Doctor,

282
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
am I dying?

283
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
High blood pressure patients

284
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
have a dizzying nausea.

285
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
You're acting as if you've lost too much blood.

286
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I'm sorry.

287
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Hey, Professor,

288
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
it's a common thing here.

289
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
The patient has a problem with the blood talks.

290
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
High blood pressure.

291
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
180.

292
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
That can't be.

293
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Please measure that again.

294
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Yes, sir.

295
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I'm sorry.

296
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I'm sorry.

297
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I'm sorry.

298
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I'm sorry.

299
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I'm sorry.

300
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I'm sorry.

301
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I'm sorry.

302
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I'm sorry.

303
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I'm sorry.

304
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I'm sorry.

305
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I'm sorry.

306
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I'm sorry.

307
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I'm sorry.

308
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I'm sorry.

309
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Hot talk. I hope no one sees.

310
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Mr. Ziaz,

311
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
are you here?

312
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I'm sorry.

313
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I'm sorry.

314
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I'm sorry.

315
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I'm sorry.

316
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I'm sorry.

317
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Ziaz,

318
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
he's too much like a drunkard, huh?

319
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Oh my God!

320
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
In this current situation,

321
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
it takes so much time

322
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
with the patients,

323
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
It's enough for today.

324
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Wait a minute.

325
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
What did the doctor say?

326
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
The patient has high blood pressure

327
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
and does not have the physical conditions to be examined.

328
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
He suggested that the blood pressure be lowered by the drug.

329
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
We will make the judgment later.

330
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
When can we do further examination?

331
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Chief Wu Tian.

332
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Chief Wu Tian.

333
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
This is a premeditated examination.

334
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
It's very risky.

335
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
If you don't do it well, you will die.

336
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I will inform you later.

337
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Dr. Meng.

338
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
You are a very important partner.

339
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
We are very happy about it.

340
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
We need to wait for the right time to do the examination.

341
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
You have to give us a clear solution now.

342
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Chief Wu Tian.

343
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Why do you have to make Dr. Meng suffer?

344
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Mr. Li doesn't need to do the blood pressure examination.

345
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
So today, you asked Dr. Shi and Dr. Meng to come.

346
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Is it for saving him or for harming him?

347
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Here.

348
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Go and get my blood pressure medicine.

349
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
My head is going to explode.

350
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Yes, Mr. Li.

351
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
You have to do it.

352
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Yes.

353
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Are you okay?

354
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I'm okay.

355
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I was so afraid.

356
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I'm sorry, Brother Shiqian.

357
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,440
I've been like this since I was a kid.

358
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,560
I'm too timid.

359
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,400
I know.

360
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,960
But you were brave today.

361
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,520
And you really helped us a lot.

362
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:39,360
Wang Jian, thank you.

363
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,920
If there's anything I can do in the future,

364
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,280
you can tell me.

365
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,800
Time will tell.

366
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:53,760
I'm sorry.

367
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,560
Brother Shixian.

368
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,040
Don't worry.

369
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,440
I'm willing to do anything.

370
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,000
I forgot.

371
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,760
We're not kids anymore.

372
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,360
I'm leaving.

373
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,400
I have to go to the hospital.

374
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,160
By the way,

375
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,400
I have an idea.

376
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,960
There's a drug called Purme.

377
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,040
It will cause a lot of pain

378
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,640
if you inject it too much.

379
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,720
It's similar to eye blindness.

380
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,800
Mr. Li's condition

381
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,240
is enough to deal with an eye doctor.

382
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:52,800
You...

383
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,440
Brother Shixian.

384
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:57,600
Don't worry.

385
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,440
I know.

386
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,520
You can do anything.

387
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,240
I won't tell anyone.

388
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:25,360
I've never used this method before.

389
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,360
So I don't know if it will work.

390
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,920
You have to think about it carefully.

391
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,120
Okay.

392
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,680
I'm leaving.

393
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,520
Wang Jian.

394
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:47,840
Thank you.

395
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,000
Thank you.

396
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:52,640
Bye.

397
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,200
What's the name of this?

398
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,200
Purme.

399
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:20,400
Purme.

400
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:23,520
Pur...

401
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,000
That's all.

402
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,240
Goodbye.

403
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:52,720
Bye.

404
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,720
Brother Shixian.

405
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,440
I know.

406
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,040
You can do anything.

407
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:12,800
Don't worry.

408
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,120
I won't tell anyone.

409
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,280
Can you stop it?

410
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,840
They're so nervous.

411
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,040
You're making fun of them.

412
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,440
Brother.

413
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,920
I'm worried about you.

414
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,760
Miss Meng is really fond of you.

415
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,760
But you're just like a piece of wood.

416
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,280
You just say thank you.

417
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,400
Do you only know how to play the game?

418
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,760
In this game,

419
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,360
I'm thinking about this.

420
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,400
In this game,

421
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,160
Meng is helping us.

422
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,600
But I think we can still win.

423
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,920
We can't be passive anymore.

424
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,840
We have to be passive.

425
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,120
Not proactive.

426
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:18,240
We're here to kill the rest.

427
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,240
I don't want to die.

428
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,540
Kill me.

429
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,520
Bring it on.

430
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,800
Scorns him.

431
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:46,800
This group escaped from the ship that could be seen from above.

432
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,340
Target to the hull.

433
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:14,800
Captain, there's a call from the Rikugun Hospital.

434
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:17,800
It's about a request for you to meet the captain.

435
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:24,800
Captain.

436
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:30,800
That Ryusei-san is talking about unnecessary things,

437
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:35,800
and is saying that he can make smoke in a place without fire.

438
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:39,800
This time, he's going to be the one to explain himself

439
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:42,800
and meet the captain.

440
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,800
It's a very bad thing.

441
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:47,800
I'm the one to do it.

442
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:51,800
Captain, don't waste your precious time.

443
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:58,800
What kind of person is he?

444
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,800
I'd like to meet him once.

445
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:10,800
Captain, I'm sorry.

446
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,800
Sorry to keep you waiting.

447
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:30,800
It's been five days.

448
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:34,800
Mr. Li, I'm your return partner.

449
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:38,800
What makes you want to make a deal with me?

450
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:40,800
You should have told me first.

451
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,800
Why didn't you tell me directly?

452
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:47,800
There are indeed some things that are useless to me.

453
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:51,800
So I want to talk to you.

454
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:57,800
Who is useless to Mr. Udori?

455
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:58,800
Okay.

456
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:04,800
I've made it clear to you that I don't want to do that check.

457
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,800
Because that check hurts my head.

458
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,800
But you forced me to do it.

459
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:11,800
Don't you believe me?

460
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,800
What is this?

461
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,800
There was a big meeting before, I was assassinated on the spot.

462
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,800
The police kidnapped me.

463
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:23,800
With my current physical condition, I can't accept that oil window check.

464
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,800
And you insisted on me doing it.

465
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,800
This is clearly to kill me.

466
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,800
I see.

467
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,800
You don't want to take revenge, do you?

468
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,800
Because I made you lose face when the password was leaked.

469
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:42,800
So you want to take revenge, right?

470
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:51,800
Mr. Li, we are all the young hunters in Dali.

471
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:54,800
How can we care about these girls?

472
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:57,800
If you are talking about this,

473
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:01,800
then there is no need to bother me.

474
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,800
Just tell me directly.

475
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:10,800
Besides, this check may be for your health.

476
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,800
For my health?

477
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,800
I really can't figure it out.

478
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:19,800
You said you were good to me.

479
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:22,800
You can ignore my safety and let me do the oil window check.

480
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,800
You said you were bad to me.

481
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,800
You even don't care about the navy?

482
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:33,800
You borrowed the power of the navy to invite me to the meeting.

483
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:37,800
There is no need to invite Mr. Miyamoto from Japan.

484
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:38,800
I remember correctly, right?

485
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,800
Yes, Mr. Li.

486
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,800
Captain Xiao Lin said that

487
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:45,800
Miyamoto was quarantined on the ship because of the temperature.

488
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,800
It was you who personally transferred the navy.

489
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:48,800
Enough!

490
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:52,800
Mr. Li, don't worry about the navy.

491
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:56,800
I really didn't know that this check was harmful.

492
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,800
I quit now.

493
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,800
If you don't want to do it,

494
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,800
then we don't have to do it.

495
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:06,800
We can wait until the public comes to check it again.

496
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:07,800
It's not worth it.

497
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:08,800
I don't understand what you are saying.

498
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,800
I want to see Captain.

499
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:19,800
Excuse me.

500
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:35,800
Captain.

501
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,800
He has already left.

502
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:46,800
Your Highness.

503
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,800
Excuse me.

504
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:51,800
You are talking nonsense.

505
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:13,800
Why is the bathroom gone?

506
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:19,800
It seems that you can't hide your eyes.

507
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,800
Although the bathroom is not open today,

508
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:25,800
we should be in the same team based on Wu Tian's reaction.

509
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:28,800
It's Wu Tian's personal action to invite the navy to the meeting.

510
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:31,800
The bathroom should be open just now.

511
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,800
So now the time is tight.

512
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:36,800
Let's do what we planned.

513
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,800
Let's go.

514
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,800
This way.

515
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,800
This way.

516
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:32,800
Come on in.

517
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,800
Take your seat.

518
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,800
What's wrong with you today?

519
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,800
Why do you want to check it?

520
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,800
Your Highness.

521
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,800
Captain Lin.

522
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,800
Captain Kobayashi.

523
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:49,800
Chief of the Left, Meng Dazuo promised me that

524
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:53,800
I can visit whenever you are in hospital.

525
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,800
Today is a special day.

526
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,800
Please have a check.

527
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,800
Please.

528
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,800
Please stay safe.

529
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:20,800
It's for everyone's safety.

530
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,800
Please.

531
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,800
Please.

532
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,800
What's wrong with you?

533
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,800
Thank you.

534
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,800
Are you okay?

535
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:08,800
After I came back last night,

536
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:12,800
Wu Tian sent someone to keep an eye on us.

537
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,800
There was no chance for the people who wanted to go to the pharmacy

538
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:30,340
and check the

539
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,800
Japanese

540
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,800
were afraid that I would have a problem with my body.

541
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,800
So they took the eye check

542
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,800
and cooperated with us until tomorrow.

543
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,800
They also gave me a large amount of Purimian.

544
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,800
I didn't eat any of it.

545
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,800
I had it all.

546
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:52,800
Even if we fail tonight,

547
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,800
we are not afraid.

548
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,800
So much Purimian

549
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,800
can definitely handle tomorrow's check.

550
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,800
I'm sure it will be a good thing.

551
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,800
I hope you can't use it.

552
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,800
Miss Xin,

553
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,800
don't look at me like that.

554
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,800
I know I look bad now.

555
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,800
But it's nothing serious.

556
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,800
I'm just a little dumb.

557
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,800
I'm not a good person.

558
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,800
I'm not a good person.

559
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,800
I'm not a good person.

560
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,800
I'm not a good person.

561
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,800
I'm not a good person.

562
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,800
I'm just a little dumb.

563
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,800
I'll be fine in a couple of days.

564
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,800
I won't be like this forever.

565
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,800
I won't be like this forever.

566
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,800
Stop catching.

567
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,800
It's not right to catch a bad person.

568
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,800
I'm sorry.

569
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,800
I'm sorry.

570
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,800
I'm sorry.

571
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,800
I'm sorry.

572
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,800
I'm sorry.

573
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,800
I'm sorry.

574
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,800
I'm sorry.

575
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,800
I'm sorry.

576
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,800
I'm sorry.

577
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,800
I'm sorry.

578
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,800
I'm sorry.

579
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,800
I'm sorry.

580
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,800
I'm sorry.

581
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,800
I'm sorry.

582
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,800
I'm sorry.

583
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:32,800
I'm sorry.

584
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,800
I'm sorry.

585
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,800
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

586
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:57,800
My legs hurt.

587
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:58,800
You're blind.

588
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:01,800
Are you okay?

589
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:02,800
Are you okay?

590
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:03,800
I'm really sorry.

591
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:04,800
Be careful.

592
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:12,800
Why are you here?

593
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,800
Jingyi and Wu Tian are in a mess.

594
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,800
The situation outside is twice as bad as usual.

595
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,800
They need time to get out.

596
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,800
I'm ready.

597
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,800
Just wait a few minutes.

598
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:25,800
I'll be right there.

599
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,800
I'm sorry.

600
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:28,800
This is what Matsumoto recently filmed.

601
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:33,800
They are on average and in contact every day.

602
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,800
If it is not for information exchange,

603
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:39,800
I can't explain why it is necessary to meet frequently like this.

604
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,800
President.

605
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:42,800
Hmm?

606
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:54,800
KLX-83?

607
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,800
This is their British battleship.

608
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,800
They are going to Hong Kong tonight.

609
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,800
I checked it.

610
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:05,800
Apparently, all of these photos and maps are the same.

611
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:10,800
That means Liu Yisuo is seriously running away.

612
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:14,800
He was about to be killed or disappeared.

613
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:20,800
In the end, it was Liu who failed to escape.

614
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:26,800
This Liu Yisuo is really going to run away.

615
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,800
First, he decided to work with the British.

616
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:33,800
He pretended to train our secret agents and lied.

617
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:38,800
Then he passed on our information to the British through Shen Biyun.

618
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:43,800
And now he is trying to escape with the British battleship.

619
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,800
Is it that simple?

620
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:52,800
Okay.

621
00:40:53,800 --> 00:41:05,380
Tonight, we will prepare the

622
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,800
aben.

623
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:41,800
When you put the bag inside the bag,

624
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:44,800
you must loosen the bag.

625
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:48,800
But you must tighten the bag tightly with a string.

626
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:53,800
Tonight, we will deploy our main force outside the hospital.

627
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:57,800
Whether the USR comes out of the waterway or not,

628
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:00,800
we must first target it.

629
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:07,800
And then, we will continue to attack from the hospital to the city.

630
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:12,800
Once the USR moves on the KLX-83,

631
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,800
we will capture it.

632
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:18,800
Wouldn't it be better if he got on the ship and caught up with Frank?

633
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:21,800
Why do we have to wait until the ship leaves?

634
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:23,800
You don't understand.

635
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:28,800
The USR is an important customer to us.

636
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:32,800
Even if he caught up with his British friends,

637
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,800
it's just a small thing.

638
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:40,800
The key is that if he tries and the British ship starts moving,

639
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:43,800
it means that he is running away.

640
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:47,800
But if the ship leaves, there is no way to stop us.

641
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,800
Get on quickly.

642
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,800
Come on.

643
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:08,800
Come on.

644
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,800
Come on.

645
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,800
It's time.

646
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:37,800
The USR is an important customer to us.

647
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:40,800
We must get on the ship and catch up with Frank.

648
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,800
And then, we will get on the ship.

649
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:45,800
Come on.

650
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:47,800
Come on.

651
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:49,800
Come on.

652
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:51,800
Come on.

653
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:53,800
Come on.

654
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:55,800
Come on.

655
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,800
Come on.

656
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:59,800
Come on.

657
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:01,800
Come on.

658
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:03,800
Come on.

659
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:05,800
Come on.

660
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:07,800
Come on.

661
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:09,800
Come on.

662
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:11,800
Come on.

663
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:13,800
Come on.

664
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:15,800
Come on.

665
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:17,800
Come on.

666
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:19,800
Come on.

667
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:21,800
Come on.

668
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:23,800
Come on.

669
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:25,800
Come on.

670
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:27,800
Come on.

671
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:29,800
Come on.

672
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:31,800
Come on.

673
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:33,800
Come on.

674
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:35,800
Come on.

675
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:37,800
Come on.

676
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,800
Come on.

677
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:41,800
Come on.

678
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:43,800
Come on.

679
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:45,800
Come on.

680
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:47,800
Come on.

681
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:49,800
Come on.

682
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:51,800
Come on.

683
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:53,800
Come on.

684
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:55,800
Come on.

685
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:57,800
Come on.

686
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:59,800
Come on.

687
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:01,800
Come on.

688
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:03,800

Come on.

701
