hold on, Please

58
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,160
Take care.

59
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,160
Luo Zhanyuan, you're here.

60
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,880
Congratulations, Luo Zhanyuan.

61
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,920
Boss Dai has personally built the house.

62
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,920
You're about to leave for Chongqing, right?

63
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,920
This telegram is from

64
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,560
the former Shanghai Station's

65
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,560
deputy commander, Cao Yuanzhong.

66
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,560
And the special envoy, Luo Han,

67
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,560
who led the construction operation.

68
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,560
He said that Cao Yuanzhong

69
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,560
was promoted to Shanghai Station's commander

70
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,560
and was promoted to the chief.

71
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,560
You're the chief of this promotion,

72
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,560
Captain Cao.

73
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,560
I'm ashamed.

74
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,560
Thanks to you and Yang Shan

75
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,200
fighting in the front line,

76
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,200
the party's hope is still

77
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,200
on you young people.

78
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,200
I heard that the bureau

79
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,200
will start the Li Yueze plan immediately

80
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,200
and order the construction operation.

81
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,200
Let Gu Yangshan and Ding Yi

82
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,200
set up an independent group.

83
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,200
You will be the one to write the name.

84
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,200
Yes.

85
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,200
My responsibilities

86
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,200
are getting heavier.

87
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,200
But I'm willing

88
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,200
to do anything for the party.

89
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,200
Yang Shan is indeed

90
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,200
very successful

91
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,200
in this operation.

92
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,200
I've already made a deal with the leader.

93
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,200
The Li Yueze plan

94
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,200
must be buried

95
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,200
in the chief of the special envoy

96
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,200
so that Yang Shan

97
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,200
will be responsible for the construction operation.

98
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,200
Don't bother him

99
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,200
with any other things.

100
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,200
Ding Yi is going to take the boat

101
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,200
to Hong Kong tonight.

102
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:20,840
He's leaving?

103
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,840
He's not one of us.

104
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,840
He doesn't need you to approve of him.

105
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:26,840
Besides,

106
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,840
we used his mother

107
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,840
to frame him.

108
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,840
Now that it's over,

109
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,840
he has no reason to stay.

110
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,840
Even if I let him go,

111
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,840
the Japanese won't let him go.

112
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,480
We're worried

113
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,480
whether Ding Yi

114
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,480
is willing to take the construction operation.

115
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,480
Besides us,

116
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,480
who else is involved

117
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,480
in the construction operation?

118
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,480
You're going to investigate the old man?

119
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,480
We've just got

120
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,480
the information about the airspace.

121
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,480
The Communist Party

122
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,480
has almost got the information

123
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,480
about the airspace at the same time.

124
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,120
If we follow this lead

125
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,120
and find out the Communist Party,

126
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,120
can we get through this?

127
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,120
You...

128
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,120
We've been looking for a long time.

129
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,120
The young man looks good.

130
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,120
You want to buy a better one?

131
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,760
I'll ask the jewelry shop

132
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,760
to buy one for you.

133
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,760
Don't be so nosy.

134
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,760
My sister is not that stingy.

135
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,760
Don't be so fancy.

136
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,760
When I was in a panic,

137
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,760
I was sick at the factory.

138
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,760
It was a red jade.

139
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,760
I had a pair of gold earrings.

140
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,760
That's how I was saved.

141
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,760
I left the factory.

142
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,760
As long as I made a lot of money,

143
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,760
my sister would give me

144
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,400
a pair of gold earrings.

145
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,400
So, this bracelet is just the beginning.

146
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,400
When I get to Hong Kong,

147
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,400
I'll make a lot of money.

148
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,400
What's wrong?

149
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,400
Look ahead.

150
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,400
Boss, I didn't find anything.

151
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,400
Take these people back and interrogate them.

152
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,400
Pack all the things

153
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,400
that have words in them.

154
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,400
Send them to the Japanese.

155
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,400
We don't need to take care of the rest.

156
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,400
I understand.

157
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,400
Move aside!

158
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,400
Wait!

159
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,400
Did Chief Wu Tian ask you to come?

160
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,400
Let them go.

161
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,400
I'll go with you to find him.

162
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,040
Chief Wu Tian,

163
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,040
we're the construction workers of the construction office.

164
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,040
We received an report

165
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,040
that there's a person

166
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,040
who's been hiding the opium in the Chaosheng Group.

167
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,040
Who?

168
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,040
Who?

169
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,040
Who?

170
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,040
Who are you?

171
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,040
Who are you?

172
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,040
Detective,

173
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,040
don't worry.

174
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,040
You said there's opium in the Chaosheng Group.

175
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,040
Where's the evidence?

176
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,680
Do you have evidence?

177
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,680
Do you have evidence?

178
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,680
Yes! Of course I have evidence!

179
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,680
What are you looking at?

180
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,680
What are you looking at?

181
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,680
The evidence

182
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,680
of the real red soil

183
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,680
that we just found!

184
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,680
Do we dare to arrest people if we don't have evidence?

185
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,680
I'm telling you,

186
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,320
come on.

187
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,320
It's not good to

188
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,320
sleep in our rental room

189
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,320
or the police station.

190
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,320
If you want to get to know someone,

191
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,320
look for me,

192
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,320
Li Boyou.

193
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,320
Do you...

194
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,320
Do you understand me?

195
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,320
Of course.

196
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,320
Okay.

197
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,320
Sir, enjoy your coffee.

198
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,960
Let's go.

199
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,960
Oh, this is the time.

200
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,960
This is it.

201
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,960
Sir,

202
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,960
we arrested everyone

203
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,960
and sent them to the police station.

204
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,960
We've finished the investigation

205
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,960
and will report it three days later.

206
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,960
That's great.

207
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,600
You're late.

208
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,600
I think

209
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,600
Mr. Miyamoto will be arriving in Shanghai soon.

210
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,600
Yes.

211
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,600
He will arrive this week.

212
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,600
I'll check it out later.

213
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,600
If you call the US later,

214
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,600
tell them I'm not there.

215
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,600
Then, Mr. Miyamoto will be coming to Shanghai

216
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,600
within a week

217
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,240
and will see how your eyes are.

218
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,240
If Mr. Miyamoto is there,

219
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,240
he won't be able to go anywhere.

220
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,240
He will be able to

221
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,240
get the light back

222
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,240
once again.

223
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,240
Where is he?

224
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,240
Right?

225
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,240
Yes.

226
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,240
Then, tell Mr. Miyamoto

227
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,240
I want to see him.

228
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,240
Tell him.

229
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,240
What did he say?

230
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,240
Lin said he's not there for five days.

231
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,240
He just doesn't want to talk to you.

232
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,240
He said Miyamoto

233
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,240
will be there in a week

234
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,240
to treat your eyes.

235
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,240
He just doesn't want to go.

236
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,240
I can't leave even if he does.

237
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,240
Are you kidding me?

238
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,880
You have to leave.

239
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,880
Excuse me, I need to use the phone.

240
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,880
Sorry.

241
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,880
Yes?

242
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,240
You're a fool.

243
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,240
I'll help you find a way.

244
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,240
That Li Boyou is a little uncle in the prairie.

245
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,240
But he's a man of no power.

246
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,240
I'll find a way to get you out of here.

247
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,240
Get in the car.

248
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,240
I'll find a way.

249
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,240
Come again.

250
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,240
The password of Li Yue-se has been deleted.

251
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,240
My task is completed.

252
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,240
I should return to Chongqing immediately.

253
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:37,240
Then I wish you a smooth and smooth battle in Shanghai.

254
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,240
Thank you.

255
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,240
Thank you.

256
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,240
No. 8 warehouse.

257
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,240
We need to delay.

258
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,240
Chief.

259
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,240
Officer Luo.

260
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:07,240
I told you they couldn't leave.

261
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,240
You really want to save me?

262
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,240
I have to save you.

263
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,240
Not only do I have to save you,

264
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,240
but we also have to run in person.

265
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,240
Look over there.

266
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,240
You're not going to make it.

267
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,240
So you're a nine-headed fox.

268
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,240
A white-bone star reincarnation.

269
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:09,240
You came to this yellow-piggy to get your chance.

270
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:12,240
You said that the guy who was in charge of the water

271
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,240
was chasing you behind your ass.

272
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,240
You're a gold digger.

273
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,240
Then you'll be late.

274
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,240
I'm sorry.

275
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,240
I'm sorry.

276
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,240
I'm sorry.

277
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,240
I'm not as cruel as you.

278
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,240
You rush to get a coffin.

279
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,240
After that, you'll be...

280
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,240
How much do we have to suffer?

281
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,240
How can you talk so harshly?

282
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,240
Li Yun.

283
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,240
You're the one to follow.

284
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,240
You're bold.

285
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,240
Follow.

286
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,240
I know you.

287
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:54,240
You don't want a coffin, do you?

288
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,240
What you want...

289
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,240
is gold!

290
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,240
You're my lord!

291
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,240
Waiter!

292
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,240
Miss Mo Xinyi, your...

293
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,240
This is a really lucky...

294
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,240
Have a drink.

295
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,240
Thanks.

296
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,240
How long has it been?

297
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,240
Why hasn't he come yet?

298
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,240
Watch out.

299
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,240
Do you remember what I told you?

300
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,240
I remember.

301
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,240
No matter what your teacher says,

302
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,240
I'll definitely leave.

303
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,240
But you have to remember what you promised me.

304
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,240
If the people in the troupe can't be rescued,

305
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,240
I won't leave.

306
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,240
Okay, I remember.

307
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,240
But I...

308
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,240
I'll be back.

309
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,240
I'm telling you.

310
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,240
You'll do as I tell you.

311
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,240
Don't worry.

312
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,240
As long as I want to leave,

313
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,240
no one can stop me.

314
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,240
When Li Yun was in the troupe,

315
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,240
I didn't go out of the gate.

316
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,240
Their car is here.

317
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,240
Go.

318
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,240
Hey!

319
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,240
What are you doing?

320
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,240
I'm trying to hide.

321
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,240
I'll knock when I'm done.

322
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,240
Wait.

323
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,240
I'll knock.

324
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,240
No.

325
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,240
What now?

326
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,240
I have to listen outside.

327
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,240
What if something happens?

328
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,240
No.

329
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,240
I'll knock.

330
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,240
You're hiding in the closet?

331
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,240
If you're done talking,

332
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:48,240
it'll be awkward for you to walk out of the closet.

333
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,240
I'll go find you.

334
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,240
Would you like a beer?

335
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,240
No, thanks.

336
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,240
I heard that the Westerners

337
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,240
like the Eastern style the most.

338
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,240
You're an old British.

339
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:18,240
You don't have to be so picky.

340
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,240
Yeah.

341
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:22,240
It's a pity that they're so picky.

342
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,240
I've been thinking about it

343
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,240
for nothing.

344
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,240
Bi Yue.

345
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,240
We've been friends for years.

346
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,240
I can't hide something from you.

347
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,240
The Japanese suspect that you're the one

348
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,240
who leaked the password.

349
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,240
They want me to investigate you.

350
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,240
Why don't you ask me a question?

351
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,240
Did you sell the message

352
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,240
to the Communist Party?

353
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,240
The Communist Party?

354
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,240
They can afford it.

355
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,240
If I'm willing,

356
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,240
I'll find a rich owner

357
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,240
in this factory.

358
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,240
The money I earned

359
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,240
overnight

360
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,240
is more than this.

361
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,240
Don't make fun of me.

362
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:30,240
The Japanese are suspicious now.

363
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,240
If I can't find it,

364
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,240
someone else will.

365
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,240
If I can't find it,

366
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,240
the nurse won't interfere.

367
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,240
Li Yun,

368
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:40,240
you'd better tell me the truth.

369
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,240
We've been friends for years.

370
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,240
British, Americans, French,

371
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,240
we've seen a lot of things.

372
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,240
How can they still find us?

373
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,240
I've said everything I should.

374
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,240
If you don't believe me,

375
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,240
at least give me a gun.

376
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,240
You can't be so angry.

377
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,240
They're them, I'm me.

378
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,240
I can always be on your side.

379
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,240
All right.

380
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,240
I know you.

381
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,240
You're rich.

382
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,240
You're not reliable.

383
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,240
If you understand me,

384
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,240
I'll give the Japanese

385
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,240
a piece of my mind.

386
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,240
How do you want to do it?

387
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,240
It seems that

388
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,240
the Japanese are all misunderstanding.

389
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,240
How about I find a chance

390
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,240
to make an appointment with the director of the dance hall?

391
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:40,240
You two can talk about it in person.

392
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,240
All right.

393
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,240
Find a chance.

394
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,240
Miss Ye, this is the money you won.

395
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,240
The new government

396
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,240
wants to establish its own information system.

397
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,240
There's a meeting tomorrow night.

398
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,240
Liang can't go.

399
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,240
Go with me.

400
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,240
So,

401
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,240
compared to being a spy,

402
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,240
you're more suitable for the interview.

403
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,240
That's the new government's intelligence system.

404
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,240
It's bigger than the British.

405
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,240
Why are you letting it go?

406
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:25,240
Take this casino as an example.

407
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,240
It doesn't matter if it's the British,

408
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,240
the French or the Americans.

409
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,240
But once others know

410
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,240
that you're related to the Japanese,

411
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,240
they'll all run away

412
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,240
when they see you.

413
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:58,900
It's like you're covered in the

414
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,240
rain.

415
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,240
People have their own calculations.

416
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:13,240
God has his own.

417
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,240
God can calculate the sky.

418
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,240
Come in.

419
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,240
Please sit down.

420
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:33,240
Where's the doctor?

421
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,240
He's inside.

422
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,240
What's the matter?

423
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,240
Sir,

424
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,240
I'll cut to the chase.

425
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,240
All the people of Chaozhong Group

426
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,240
were arrested by the police.

427
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,240
And according to my knowledge,

428
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,240
the detective in the police station, Li Boyao,

429
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,240
is your uncle, right?

430
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,240
That's a shame.

431
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,240
But don't worry.

432
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,240
I'll tell him

433
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:03,240
to deal with the Japanese.

434
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,240
Don't move.

435
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,240
Thank you, sir.

436
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,240
And thank you to all the people

437
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,240
of Yangshan, Dingyi and Chaozhong Group.

438
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,240
Nothing else?

439
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,240
I didn't expect you to say that so quickly.

440
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,240
I'm sorry.

441
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,240
How do you arrange Dingyi?

442
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,240
Although Li Yueci's password

443
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,240
has been changed,

444
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,240
the Japanese still don't believe us.

445
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,240
So I plan to send Dingyi away as soon as possible.

446
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,240
The sooner the better.

447
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,240
Who said Dingyi was leaving?

448
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,240
Don't look at me.

449
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:43,240
I've already

450
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,240
told Captain Cao about your intention.

451
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,240
Captain Cao, leader Youfang,

452
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,240
Li Yueci's action in Shanghai Station

453
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:51,240
has become famous in the station.

454
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,240
This is called the construction operation.

455
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,240
The construction operation was first established.

456
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,240
The Japanese are going to

457
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,240
establish the special forces headquarters.

458
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,240
Now is the time to use it.

459
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,240
Your operation

460
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,240
is of great significance

461
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:07,240
to Shanghai Station.

462
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,240
If Boss Dai knows that you're doing it without permission,

463
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,240
don't say that I can't help you.

464
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:13,240
Even your father

465
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,240
can't help you if he wants to help you.

466
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:19,240
Yangshan Department of Foreign Affairs

467
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,240
has nothing to do with my father.

468
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,240
You really don't know?

469
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,240
Your father

470
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:27,240
is behind this operation.

471
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,240
The Japanese are trying their best to make it happen.

472
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,240
Boss Dai knows it.

473
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,240
He said that when our operation

474
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,240
is successful,

475
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,240
he will come to the director and ask for our help.

476
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:43,240
When you go to the Gu family,

477
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,240
you can't escape

478
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,240
with those two brides.

479
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:51,240
If the operation fails,

480
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,240
two bullets

481
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,240
won't be able to burn.

482
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,240
Failure is one thing.

483
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,240
Escaping is another.

484
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,240
Yangshan, Yangshan.

485
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,240
You call me a teacher.

486
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,240
I can't look at you wrong.

487
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,240
I can't look at you wrong.

488
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:19,240
Are you really going to fight for your life?

489
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,240
No.

490
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,240
That's good.

491
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,240
Within this week,

492
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:31,240
the Japanese eye doctor came to see Ding Yi.

493
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:33,240
But we really can't continue.

494
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,240
This is what

495
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,240
you were scared of.

496
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,240
I thought it was a small thing.

497
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,240
It's a small thing.

498
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:47,240
How can it be a small thing?

499
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:49,240
Of course it can't be a small thing.

500
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,240
Even if Ding Yi has a strong eye,

501
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,240
can he fool the doctor?

502
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,240
Can he fool those elite electronic devices?

503
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,240
Do you want to sit here?

504
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,240
Come here.

505
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:03,240
Come here.

506
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,240
Come here.

507
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,240
What if

508
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,240
he's really blind?

509
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,240
What do you mean?

510
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,240
When Boss Dai

511
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:19,240
was going to continue this assassination operation,

512
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,240
I kept thinking

513
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,240
he can't keep acting like a blind man.

514
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,240
This is not the same thing.

515
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:27,240
I specifically asked

516
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,240
the American doctor who was treating the chairman's wife.

517
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:31,240
He told me

518
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,240
that the American army had discovered a kind of nerve toxin.

519
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,240
As long as it's around your eyes,

520
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,240
you have to take a needle.

521
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,240
In less than five minutes,

522
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,240
you can completely destroy

523
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,240
his blind nerve.

524
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:47,240
This is what I wanted to see.

525
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,240
Isn't it a coincidence?

526
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:51,240
It's useful.

527
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,240
This is called

528
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:55,240
prepared.

529
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:03,240
What's going on?

530
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,240
Let go of me.

531
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,240
Ding Yi, open the door.

532
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,240
Open the door.

533
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:21,240
Don't shoot. Don't shoot. I'll talk to him.

534
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,240
I'll talk to him.

535
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,240
Ding Yi,

536
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:27,240
come out quickly.

537
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,240
I'm not going out. Gu Xiaoshan,

538
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,240
I'm so mad at you.

539
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:33,240
Hurry up.

540
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,240
Come out quickly.

541
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:37,240
Don't talk to him.

542
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,240
You calm down, okay?

543
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,240
Get out of my way.

544
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:49,240
Where is he?

545
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:51,240
This kid runs too fast.

546
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,240
Gu Xiaoshan,

547
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:55,240
you did it on purpose.

548
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,240
You're crazy.

549
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,240
You're stupid.

550
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:03,240
Didn't I tell you

551
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,240
that Ding Yi is not a member of our military?

552
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:07,240
He died and died.

553
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:09,240
He has no loss to our military.

554
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,240
Now he's dead.

555
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:13,240
No, teacher.

556
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,240
I understand

557
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,240
what you said.

558
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:19,240
But if we blinded

559
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,240
Ding Yi's eyes,

560
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,240
our military will be

561
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,240
destroyed.

562
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,240
You're so cold.

563
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:33,240
What do we do

564
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,240
for the anti-Japanese?

565
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:37,240
We're not fighting for the country.

566
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,240
We're not fighting for the anti-Japanese.

567
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:43,240
So many anti-Japanese

568
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:45,240
are fighting for the country.

569
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,240
They're even losing their lives.

570
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,240
How can we

571
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:51,240
blind them?

572
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,240
He did more

573
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,240
than us

574
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,240
in the hot-blooded war.

575
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,240
So I don't agree

576
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:01,240
to blind him.

577
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:03,240
Gu Xiaoshan, Gu Xiaoshan,

578
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,240
don't forget

579
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:07,240
that

580
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,240
you made him join the army.

581
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:13,240
Teacher, I can't agree more.

582
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:19,240
If we don't blind him,

583
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,240
how can he

584
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,240
be more like you?

585
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,240
Think about it.

586
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:51,240
Go to hell, you bastard.

587
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,240
That bastard

588
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,240
is so good at

589
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:57,240
running on the mountain.

590
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,240
I'd rather die than run on the mountain.

591
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:13,240
Stop the car.

592
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,240
Stop the car.

593
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,240
Stop the car.

594
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,240
Wang!

595
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,240
Wang Yue!

596
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,240
Luo!

597
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,240
Miss Xing.

598
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:25,240
You bastard.

599
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,240
The people from the prison are here.

600
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,240
They've taken all our people.

601
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:31,240
Look, I've been away from Shanghai

602
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:33,240
for so long.

603
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,240
I don't even know

604
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:37,240
what's going on in Shanghai.

605
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,240
Are you free today?

606
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,240
Come with me to the street.

607
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,240
I can't beat you.

608
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:51,240
I can't beat you.

609
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,240
I'll be with you today.

610
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:03,240
I got it.

611
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:05,240
Okay, I'll go first.

612
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:07,240
Miss, don't stay here too long.

613
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:21,240
Hey,

614
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,240
look around.

615
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:25,240
How is it?

616
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:31,240
Hey, Inoue.

617
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:33,240
How is it?

618
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:41,240
Captain!

619
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:43,240
Captain!

620
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:45,240
Captain!

621
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,240
Captain!

622
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,240
Captain!

623
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,240
Where is it?

624
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:01,240
Here.

625
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:03,240
Hurry.

626
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:19,240
Hurry.

627
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,240
The police.

628
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:25,240
The Communist Party.

629
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,240
The Communist Party.

630
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:11,240
The police.

631
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,240
I want to report.

632
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,240
Captain,

633
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:17,240
I'm here.

634
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,240
You ran away?

635
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,240
I ran away.

636
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:37,240
When I was cleaning up over there,

637
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:39,240
I heard gunshots.

638
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:41,240
I ran over

639
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:43,240
and there was no one.

640
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:45,240
Where did you run away?

641
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,240
I don't know.

642
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:49,240
You don't know?

643
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,240
I don't know.

644
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,240
I don't know.

645
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,240
I don't know.

646
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:57,240
You bastard!

647
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:59,240
You bastard!

648
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:01,240
Yes.

649
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:03,240
Search the whole city

650
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,240
from one place.

651
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:07,240
Yes.

652
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:15,240
Yes.

653
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:45,240
Yes.

654
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:15,240
I heard their strict warning.

655
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,240
But Li Yue Se is missing.

656
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,240
The only explanation

657
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:21,240
is that Li Yue Se was scared by the people in the first team.

658
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:23,240
So I was scared.

659
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:25,240
So the Japanese people won't doubt Li Yue Se's identity.

660
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:27,240
They won't kill the people

661
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:29,240
of Chaosheng Group.

662
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:31,240
I heard that Gu Yang Shan

663
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:33,240
was very thoughtful in Chongqing.

664
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:35,240
I thought

665
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:37,240
everyone was giving Commander Gu some respect.

666
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:39,240
Today,

667
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:41,240
I've seen it.

668
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:43,240
I'll go to Chaosheng Group.

669
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:45,240
I'll see if there's any clue.

670
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:47,240
Come.

671
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:49,240
You're Tie La Xin.

672
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:51,240
Are you going to send Ding Yi away?

673
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:55,240
Gu Shu was killed in front of me.

674
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:57,240
And I pretend I don't know him.

675
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,240
I don't want this

676
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:03,240
to happen again on Ding Yi.

677
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,240
I'll go to the other side.

678
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:13,240
You!

679
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:15,240
Come here.

680
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,240
Taikun, this way, please.

681
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:19,240
Let me tell you, brother-in-law.

682
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:21,240
I haven't finished

683
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:23,240
my Japanese job.

684
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:25,240
I don't have time for this.

685
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:27,240
Taikun, this way, please.

686
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:29,240
I'll leave you alone.

687
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:31,240
Kobayashi.

688
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:35,240
You're just in time.

689
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:37,240
I'm interrogating these people.

690
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:39,240
But they all said

691
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:41,240
they didn't know

692
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,240
the female Communist Party's office.

693
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:45,240
So don't be anxious.

694
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:47,240
Give me some time

695
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:49,240
before I can open their mouths.

696
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,240
Let them go first.

697
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:53,240
This is the main point.

698
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:55,240
What?

699
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:57,240
Let them go first.

700
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:59,240
Last night,

701
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:01,240
he disappeared

702
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:03,240
from the meeting room.

703
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:05,240
He's a British citizen.

704
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:07,240
He's not going to leave the country.

705
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:09,240
Find him right away.

706
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:13,240
What?

707
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:15,240
Last night, he was in the Dado Hotel

708
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:17,240
to escape the assassination.

709
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:19,240
He's a British citizen.

710
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:21,240
He won't run away.

711
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:23,240
Find him as soon as possible.

712
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:25,240
Kobayashi.

713
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:27,240
We're doing business.

714
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:29,240
I hope you can help us.

715
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:33,240
You were in a hurry

716
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:35,240
to find the female Communist Party.

717
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:37,240
I was about to do this with you.

718
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:39,240
But you're rushing me

719
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,240
to find this person.

720
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:43,240
I'm not that busy.

721
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:45,240
I'm too busy.

722
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:55,240
I'm sorry.

723
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:03,240
The military police are looking for

724
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,240
the Communist Party.

725
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:07,240
You need to find

726
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:09,240
Li Yue Si as soon as possible.

727
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:13,240
Okay. I know.

728
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:15,240
No problem.

729
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:25,240
Hello?

730
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:27,240
It's me.

731
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:29,240
Biyun.

732
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:31,240
I'm so sorry.

733
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:33,240
I was in the bathroom.

734
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:35,240
It's not convenient.

735
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:39,240
I'll go with you

736
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:41,240
to the dance party tomorrow night.

737
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:43,240
But I have one condition.

738
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:45,240
I want to see

739
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:47,240
Wutian's superior.

740
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:55,240
Okay.

741
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:57,240
I'll go with you.

742
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:59,240
Okay.

743
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:01,240
I'll go with you.

744
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:03,240
Okay.

745
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:23,240
Hello?

746
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:25,240
Oh my god.

747
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:27,240
You hit my hand.

748
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:29,240
You're not even

749
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:31,240
a man.

750
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:33,240
Sorry.

751
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:35,240
Where did you get it?

752
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:39,240
Oh my god.

753
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:41,240
Three big yellow fish.

754
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:43,240
What a big deal.

755
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:45,240
You

756
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:47,240
helped me find someone.

757
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:49,240
This person is Ding Yi.

758
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:51,240
He's an important chess piece for me.

759
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:53,240
But he wants to break the hook.

760
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:56,240
The Japanese have

761
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:58,240
a lot of help in the waterway.

762
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,240
He has a relationship with the Japanese.

763
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,240
I'm afraid he has to go to the wild dock.

764
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:04,240
You

765
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,240
find him for me.

766
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,240
If he doesn't want to come back,

767
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,240
you bring his body back.

768
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,240
Ding Yi?

769
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:19,240
Joseph Li.

770
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:21,240
Ding Yi.

771
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:23,240
Ding Yi.

772
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:25,240
Joseph Li.

773
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:27,240
Please help me check.

774
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:35,240
I'm so tired.

775
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:37,240
You're bullying me.

776
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:39,240
You're not even sleeping.

777
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:43,240
Eat, eat, eat. You only know how to eat.

778
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:45,240
Look at me.

779
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:47,240
What good fruit can they give you?

780
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:49,240
If I don't give you a needle, it's good.

781
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:57,240
Eat everything.

782
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:59,240
You eat the newspaper too.

783
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:13,240
Hong Yue?

784
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:19,240
The Communist Party?

785
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:21,240
Impossible.

786
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:23,240
I know Ding Yi's temper.

787
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:25,240
He won't

788
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:27,240
do this without a reason.

789
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:33,240
What did you do to him?

790
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:39,240
Miss Xia,

791
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:41,240
it's not the time to talk about this.

792
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:43,240
The Japanese have notified the police.

793
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:45,240
Even if they turn Shanghai into a place of rest,

794
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:47,240
we have to find Ding Yi.

795
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:49,240
The only way is to find him before the Japanese.

796
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:51,240
Only I can protect him.

797
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:53,240
If you can protect him,

798
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:55,240
why would he run away?

799
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:59,240
Miss Xia,

800
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:01,240
Ding Yi said before,

801
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:03,240
if something happens to the Communist Party,

802
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:05,240
he won't leave Shanghai.

803
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:07,240
But now Hong Yue is being wanted everywhere.

804
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:09,240
I've been looking for him for a long time.

805
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:11,240
Where will he go?

806
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:13,240
Who will he go?

807
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:15,240
I'm not sure.

808
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:17,240
It's not too late.

809
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:27,240
I just lied to the Japanese.

810
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:29,240
Li Yueze ran away to avoid the Chuxian team.

811
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:31,240
But I don't know how long

812
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:33,240
this lie can last.

813
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:35,240
I contacted a ship that was on the move.

814
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:37,240
If I find Ding Yi,

815
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:39,240
I'll send him to Shanghai immediately.

816
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:41,240
But Miss Xia,

817
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:43,240
if we don't go,

818
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:45,240
we can't guarantee that anything will happen.

819
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:45,240
No direction, no way out

820
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:49,240
Pain in the eyes

821
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:53,240
The person who made the fake sacrifice is not clear

822
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:55,240
Where is the wind going?

823
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:57,240
Whose window is shaking?

824
00:43:57,240 --> 00:43:59,240
The sound of the flute

825
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:03,240
The heart is thinking

826
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:05,240
It's either you or me

827
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:07,240
I'm following

828
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:09,240
He is watching

829
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:11,240
The vast night

830
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:13,240
The tears flow

831
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:15,240
The wound is broken

832
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:17,240
He is watching

833
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:19,240
Wandering in the shadow

834
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:21,240
The night falls

835
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:23,240
Looking back at the world

836
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:41,240
En 800

837
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:53,240
The fake sacrifice is on the way

838
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:57,240
No direction, no way out

839
00:44:57,240 --> 00:45:01,240
Pain in the eyes

840
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:05,240
The person who made the fake sacrifice is not clear

841
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:07,240
Where is the wind going?

842
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:08,240
Where is it?

843
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:10,240
Who's window is shaking?

844
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,240
The sound of the lock

845
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:15,240
The heart is thinking

846
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:17,240
Or you or me

847
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:19,240
I'm feeling it

848
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:21,240
He's watching

849
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:24,240
In the vast night
