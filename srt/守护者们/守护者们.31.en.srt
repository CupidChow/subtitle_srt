1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You

2
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You

3
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,360
Oh

4
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,600
Oh

5
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
The night falls, and the night falls.

6
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
The night falls, and the night falls.

7
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
The night falls, and the night falls.

8
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
The night falls, and the night falls.

9
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Go home.

10
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Go home.

11
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Goodbye.

12
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Goodbye.

13
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Take care.

14
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Go home.

15
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
The Night of the Dragon

16
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Emotions must always be placed in the present moment.

17
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Our positions are already different.

18
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
You're right. I forgot you're an organized person.

19
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
From now on, we'll never cross the river.

20
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Eat more.

21
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Go back to Chongqing and get water.

22
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
The Night of the Dragon

23
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
So, you couldn't stay either.

24
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,000
When the war is won, I'll take care of these color-blind people one by one.

25
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,000
The Night of the Dragon

26
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
We're really fated.

27
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I'm in Room 103.

28
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
You can come find me anytime.

29
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
The Night of the Dragon

30
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
The door's not locked.

31
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Brother Liao.

32
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Where's Mrs. Liang?

33
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Charlie.

34
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Looks like your Commander Cao didn't tell you anything.

35
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
The situation is urgent. We can't rush.

36
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I don't have any French wine to treat you to.

37
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
The Night of the Dragon

38
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I know what you're thinking right now.

39
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I should have died in the hands of Cao Yuan Zhong,

40
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
not here, right?

41
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I'm telling you, I'm not as simple as you think.

42
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I have not only a few pieces of gold,

43
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
but also a lot of grudges.

44
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
But the most important grudge

45
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,000
was my wife's life-changing.

46
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
If it were my wife,

47
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I wouldn't have survived.

48
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I wouldn't have been in pain.

49
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
You wouldn't have been in pain.

50
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Because we're different.

51
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
We're born different.

52
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
We're different.

53
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
The road is long and the road is short.

54
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
It's all my choice.

55
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
But there's one thing you should understand.

56
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Charlie, tell me.

57
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
What should I write in the report after I return to Chongqing?

58
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
What report?

59
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Captain Cao has opened a man-made window for me.

60
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
He's proving that I'm a comrade

61
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
who's involved in the Japanese-US intelligence.

62
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
But your report didn't mention my name.

63
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
So we have to get this done.

64
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I've helped you a lot before.

65
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Why don't you help me out in Chongqing?

66
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
As a brother,

67
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I should help you.

68
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
But Charlie,

69
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
how did you leave Shanghai?

70
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I don't know.

71
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
How far is it?

72
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I don't have the ability to help you.

73
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Oh, my.

74
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
He must have useful information.

75
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
If he doesn't find it, he can't die.

76
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
We're here to ask you a favor.

77
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Since we're a team,

78
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
we should help each other when we go back.

79
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
We can't get a young general out of the operation.

80
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
But maybe we can get a few superiors.

81
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
As far as I know,

82
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
the deputy commander of Hong Kong,

83
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
the commander of the army,

84
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
should be a superior.

85
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Ha ha ha ha.

86
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Ha ha ha ha.

87
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Ha ha ha ha.

88
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Ha ha ha ha.

89
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
We're just the middlemen.

90
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
We look like fools.

91
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
We have no other choice.

92
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
We have a plan.

93
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
You have a plan, don't you?

94
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,500
In the center,

95
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:08,500
we are just pawns that can be used at any time.

96
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,000
You are here,

97
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,000
fighting for the people with your life,

98
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,500
trying to protect your comrades.

99
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,500
But your country,

100
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
in order to protect itself,

101
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,500
abandoned you like a piece of trash.

102
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,500
In your country,

103
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:33,500
the weight of human life is different.

104
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,500
This feeling of not caring about life and death,

105
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
you should know better than me.

106
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I have already won this bet.

107
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I will tell you now,

108
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
a reason that can't move me.

109
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,500
There are many people in Hong Kong

110
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:31,500
who have buried a lot of gold and gold.

111
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,500
I told Cao Yuan Zhong about this,

112
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,500
but I don't know the exact location.

113
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:38,500
Even the hidden things of the plan will be known to Boss Dai.

114
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,500
So no one can move me,

115
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,500
except you.

116
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,500
Brother Liang is really a good man.

117
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,500
Come on.

118
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,500
Erlin,

119
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,500
I hope you don't disappoint me.

120
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:30,500
Boss Dai is waiting for me in Chongqing.

121
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,500
I will not let you go.

122
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,500
Boss Dai will not let you go.

123
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,500
I will pay you back.

124
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,500
Even if I have to pay you back,

125
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,500
I will not let you go.

126
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,500
I will not let you go.

127
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,500
I will not let you go.

128
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,500
Come on.

129
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,500
Do you believe what he said?

130
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,500
What?

131
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,500
Brother,

132
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:40,500
do you believe what he said?

133
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,500
I believe you.

134
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,500
I believe you.

135
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,500
I believe you.

136
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,500
In the following years,

137
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,500
there are countless guardians like Ding Yi

138
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:31,500
who fight on the battlefields of the anti-Japanese war.

139
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,500
They are the ones who spread the news

140
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,500
and broke the foundation of the enemy

141
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,500
during the long-awaited war

142
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,500
in the Dian Tai.

143
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,500
They are the ones who are the ones who are the ones

144
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,500
who are the ones who are the ones

145
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,500
who are the ones

146
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,500
who are the ones

147
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,500
who are the ones

148
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:52,160
who are the ones

149
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,860
who are the ones

150
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:56,860
who are the ones

151
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,820
who are the ones

152
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,820
who are the ones

153
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,820
who are the ones

154
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:05,820
who are the ones

155
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:06,820
who are the ones

156
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:08,820
who are the ones

157
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:10,820
who are the ones

158
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:13,940
who are the ones

159
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:15,940
who are the ones

160
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:20,940
The Chinese people are like a tough warrior.

161
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:25,940
Finally, victory came on this day.

162
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:29,940
After this day, he will be strong.

163
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:33,940
After this day, he will be free.

164
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:39,940
The Chinese people are like a tough warrior.

165
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:43,940
After this day, he will be strong.

166
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:47,940
After this day, he will be free.

167
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:08,940
The Chinese people are like a tough warrior.

168
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:13,940
After this day, he will be strong.

169
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:38,940
The door in Sanyang has been locked.

170
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:41,940
You need to take some stuff to get in.

171
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:43,940
What did you say?

172
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:46,940
Wait a minute.

173
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:48,940
Wait a minute.

174
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:50,940
Come in.

175
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:52,940
Thank you, comrade.

176
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:56,940
Guys, the Chinese people's house is ahead.

177
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:58,940
Let's go in.

178
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:00,940
ʺTiancheng Theaterʺ

179
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,940
will be simple!

180
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:18,940
We can finally say Tha Hamtien has made it to today.

181
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:31,940
Comrade Lao Xiao, hello.

182
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:33,940
Let me introduce myself.

183
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:35,940
My name is Ding Yi.

184
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:38,940
You're not Li Yue Se anymore?

185
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:46,940
This is the report of the work situation

186
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:48,940
between me and Comrade Bi Yun

187
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:50,940
in the Republic of China for 29 years.

188
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,940
There are Comrade Gu Fu Hua, Comrade Zhu Hongyu,

189
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:55,940
and Comrade Shen Danqing in it.

190
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:57,940
Please conduct the interrogation.

191
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:02,940
We will definitely remember

192
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:04,940
the bloodshed and sacrifices.

193
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:06,940
We can't forget them.

194
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,940
Comrade Bi Yun said that

195
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:11,940
the situation was urgent.

196
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:13,940
I was in a big trouble.

197
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:16,940
I didn't have time to take the formal education.

198
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:18,940
Now the mission is over.

199
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:20,940
He wants me to return to Yan'an to study

200
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:22,940
and complete my classes.

201
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:24,940
Comrade Bi Yun said that?

202
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:27,940
Listen to the words and the sound.

203
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:29,940
You seem to have your own thoughts.

204
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,940
It's like this.

205
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:35,940
Bi Yun and I met

206
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:37,940
in the Imperial Sound Group.

207
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:40,940
That's also my only home in Shanghai.

208
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:42,940
So I think,

209
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:44,940
is it possible

210
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:46,940
for us to finish the wedding

211
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:49,940
in the Imperial Sound Group and go to Yan'an?

212
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:52,940
Does Bi Yun agree?

213
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:53,940
Of course she agrees.

214
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:55,940
My wife will listen to me.

215
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:59,940
I didn't mean that.

216
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:01,940
I mean my wife,

217
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:02,940
Comrade Bi Yun,

218
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:04,940
will listen to the organization.

219
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:05,940
As long as the organization agrees,

220
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:07,940
she will not object.

221
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:09,940
Comrade Tian Yi,

222
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:10,940
your wedding,

223
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:11,940
of course,

224
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,940
is decided by you two.

225
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:14,940
If you need anything,

226
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,940
we will fully support you.

227
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,940
Anything else?

228
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:20,940
Comrade Xiao,

229
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:21,940
the details of your materials

230
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:23,940
and my partner Gu Yangshan's situation

231
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:24,940
are explained.

232
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:26,940
Our comrade has contacted him

233
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:27,940
to discuss the situation.

234
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:28,940
In fact,

235
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:30,940
he has already lost his way

236
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:31,940
to the Kuomintang and the military.

237
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:34,940
He was going to go far away from his father,

238
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:36,940
but now the anti-Japanese victory has come.

239
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:39,940
He wants to stay with his father

240
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:41,940
and fight for the peace of the two parties.

241
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,940
Will he join us?

242
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:45,940
Yes.

243
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:47,940
He has been looking for

244
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,940
the right path.

245
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:51,940
But he still lacks a key.

246
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:53,940
Okay, I understand.

247
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:54,940
At the same time,

248
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:56,940
I have an important task

249
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,940
that needs your cooperation.

250
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:04,940
Chairman Mao,

251
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:07,940
didn't you already negotiate with Lao Jiang in Chongqing?

252
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:09,940
Will there be any changes?

253
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:10,940
After the Japanese surrendered,

254
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:13,940
Chongqing seemed to negotiate with us.

255
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:16,940
The North China Sea is also a strategic encirclement

256
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:18,940
for the liberation zone and is also a test attack.

257
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:22,940
They are going to scout our bottom line.

258
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:23,940
This time,

259
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:26,940
we must not make the same mistake again.

260
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:29,940
We must be on guard.

261
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:31,940
The Kuomintang's Sujian operation

262
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:33,940
has been a complete defense.

263
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:36,940
In fact,

264
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:39,940
they are going to use Sujian

265
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:41,940
to calculate our comrades.

266
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:45,940
These doctors were forced to work in the Japanese hospital

267
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:48,940
during the anti-Japanese war.

268
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:51,940
They once helped us.

269
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:53,940
But now,

270
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:56,940
they are all on the list of the Sujian Committee.

271
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:58,940
The organization decided

272
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:00,940
to transfer them to the liberation zone as soon as possible

273
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:03,940
in case of any harm.

274
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:06,940
The organization decided to give this task to you.

275
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:08,940
First, we will take them to the group.

276
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:10,940
When our comrades arrive,

277
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:12,940
we will immediately rescue them.

278
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:18,940
Mengjie.

279
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:23,940
Mengjie.

280
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:54,940
Don't kill me.

281
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:56,940
Don't kill me.

282
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:57,940
I'm not a spy.

283
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:58,940
I'm going to the north of the lake

284
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:01,940
to cover the guerrilla of the Eighth Route Army.

285
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:04,940
Then you should die.

286
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:23,940
I'm sorry.

287
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:35,940
I made this for you.

288
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:37,940
It's a wedding dress.

289
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:39,940
Try it on.

290
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:41,940
If it doesn't fit, I'll change it for you.

291
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:49,940
What?

292
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:51,940
You're wearing too many wedding dresses.

293
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:53,940
You don't look like Zhu Shanzhuang.

294
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:02,940
This afternoon,

295
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:05,940
I will clean up the dormitory.

296
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,940
When the doctors arrive,

297
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:09,940
there will be a place to sleep.

298
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:11,940
But tomorrow,

299
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:13,940
you have to go out and buy a few beds.

300
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:14,940
The four years of not having sun,

301
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:16,940
they will all be gone.

302
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:17,940
You...

303
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:19,940
I know.

304
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:23,940
I'm your superior.

305
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,940
I let you meet Xiao

306
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:29,940
because I hope you can get familiar with the party.

307
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:32,940
I don't want you to be in a hurry after you come back.

308
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:34,940
You don't have to tell me the mission.

309
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:38,940
The list.

310
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:40,940
Here,

311
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:42,940
your superior.

312
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:44,940
If it happens again,

313
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:46,940
I won't forgive you.

314
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:52,940
I'm sorry, Pi.

315
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:54,940
I waited for four years for the wedding.

316
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:56,940
It looks like

317
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:58,940
we still have to wait some time.

318
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:04,940
I'm sorry.

319
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:06,940
I'm sorry.

320
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:09,940
Mengjie?

321
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:25,940
Father,

322
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:27,940
slow down.

323
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:29,940
It's been ten years.

324
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:34,940
The wedding can finally rest in peace.

325
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:45,940
And Uncle Gu.

326
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,940
Uncle Gu's sacrifice

327
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:51,940
is not enough.

328
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:53,940
I'm sorry.

329
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:55,940
I'm sorry.

330
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:00,940
You didn't waste your time.

331
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:11,940
I've already made a decision.

332
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:15,940
Now is a good day.

333
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:18,940
Don't think about the

334
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:20,940
secret code again.

335
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:22,940
The Japanese are gone.

336
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:24,940
No one will be able to use it again.

337
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:27,940
If you have time,

338
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:29,940
you should spend it with me.

339
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:32,940
Spend it with him.

340
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:36,940
Okay.

341
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:38,940
But Yanshan

342
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:40,940
still likes to deal with math.

343
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:42,940
And the Japanese secret code

344
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:44,940
is still valuable.

345
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:46,940
But father,

346
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:48,940
you are in a state of crisis.

347
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:50,940
Now the state affairs are in chaos.

348
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:52,940
You are worried about nothing.

349
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:54,940
There are still many things

350
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:56,940
that I can take you to deal with.

351
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:12,940
We agreed to go to England.

352
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:14,940
Don't hesitate anymore.

353
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:20,940
Father,

354
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:22,940
the war is won.

355
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:24,940
The captain's heart is not dead.

356
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:26,940
We hope you can stay

357
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:28,940
and help us.

358
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:30,940
They can persuade me,

359
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:34,940
but I can't persuade the captain.

360
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:40,940
If I don't give up,

361
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:42,940
I will soon become

362
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:44,940
the sinner of the war.

363
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:48,940
Don't be a sleeper.

364
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:52,940
I will be a sleeper.

365
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:00,940
Turn around.

366
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:04,940
Raise your hands.

367
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:06,940
Raise them.

368
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:16,940
This is too big.

369
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:18,940
It's bigger than my head.

370
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:20,940
I brought it on the wedding day.

371
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:26,940
Sit down.

372
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:50,940
What are you thinking?

373
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:58,940
When we first met,

374
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:04,940
you looked at me like this.

375
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:20,940
You don't have to pretend to be someone else anymore.

376
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:26,940
I finally have a real home.

377
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:50,940
It seems that father also thinks

378
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:52,940
that the negotiations between the two parties

379
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:54,940
in Chongqing are not optimistic.

380
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:00,940
Jiang Wei is used to singing

381
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:02,940
solo opera.

382
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:04,940
You suddenly want him to sing

383
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:06,940
Sanjie Yi.

384
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:08,940
He can't sing it.

385
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:12,940
But my father taught me

386
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:14,940
since I was a child.

387
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:16,940
He thinks that

388
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:18,940
after 14 years of fighting,

389
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:20,940
we are now united,

390
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:22,940
peaceful and unified.

391
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:24,940
It's what the people want.

392
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:26,940
People are determined, father.

393
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:28,940
No matter how powerful Jiang Wei is,

394
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:30,940
he can't beat the people.

395
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:34,940
So now is the critical moment of negotiation.

396
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:36,940
Are you really going to retreat?

397
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:40,940
What's the use of me staying?

398
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:42,940
I can go to Zhang Xueliang's

399
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:44,940
Yanghu City and make a military sword.

400
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:46,940
A military sword?

401
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:48,940
Grab the hands of the Yangwu Yuan party

402
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:50,940
and let him sign the contract?

403
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:56,940
Father,

404
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:58,940
but do you really want to watch

405
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:00,940
them use the name of Su Jian Chu Ni

406
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:02,940
to carry out the same punishment?

407
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:04,940
Now there is a lot of power in Shanghai.

408
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:06,940
Their Su Jian Committee will arrest people and release people.

409
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:08,940
It's not a court trial at all.

410
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:10,940
The whole situation is already good.

411
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:12,940
And they dare to make a sudden move

412
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:14,940
and suddenly make a sudden move.

413
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:16,940
They are openly shooting

414
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:18,940
at the so-called traitors.

415
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:20,940
The gunfire has been going on

416
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:22,940
from start to finish.

417
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:24,940
If you retreat,

418
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:26,940
who else can control them?

419
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:28,940
Is this the result

420
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:30,940
of the revolutionary banner

421
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:32,940
of our Gu family?

422
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:34,940
How dare you!

423
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:36,940
Yangshan,

424
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:38,940
it's been five years

425
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:40,940
since you came back.

426
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:42,940
Tell me,

427
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:44,940
how many points

428
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:46,940
did you achieve

429
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:48,940
by using the three-man idea

430
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:50,940
you saw?

431
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:52,940
I'm not sure.

432
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:54,940
Then did you and I

433
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:56,940
ever follow the rules

434
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:58,940
of the palace and the royal court?

435
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:00,940
I'm not sure.

436
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:02,940
I'm not sure.

437
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:04,940
I'm not sure.

438
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:06,940
If all the parties

439
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:08,940
in the party are all

440
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:10,940
for the country and the people,

441
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:12,940
and all are fair,

442
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:14,940
why is today's China

443
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:16,940
still

444
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:18,940
so difficult

445
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:20,940
and so miserable?

446
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:28,940
Yangshan,

447
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:30,940
when I was young,

448
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:32,940
I was the same.

449
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:34,940
I believed in the will of God.

450
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:38,940
Half of my life has passed.

451
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:40,940
When I look back,

452
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:42,940
I have no success.

453
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:44,940
I also found

454
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:46,940
that I'm old.

455
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:48,940
I can't do anything.

456
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:54,940
I can't

457
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:56,940
do the things of the Su family.

458
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:58,940
Don't be so arrogant.

459
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:00,940
I still dare to

460
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:02,940
call Miss Dambang

461
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:04,940
and send her out of Shanghai.

462
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:06,940
It's an explanation to the people

463
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:08,940
of our Gu family.

464
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:12,940
Father,

465
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:14,940
if it's just an explanation,

466
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:16,940
then the ice crystal

467
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:18,940
doesn't need to be sacrificed.

468
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:20,940
It's okay.

469
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:28,940
Yang Xie Sen,

470
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:30,940
I have to go.

471
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:32,940
Please

472
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:34,940
take care of my father.

473
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:36,940
Thank you.

474
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:40,940
Commander Mu!

475
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:42,940
Commander Mu!

476
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:44,940
Commander Mu!

477
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:48,940
Father!

478
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:02,940
They say that

479
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:04,940
Chief Mao

480
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:06,940
likes that house

481
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:08,940
on the edge of Hongpu.

482
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,940
Meng Mingyu also gave it to his daughter.

483
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:12,940
That's what it says on the deed?

484
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:18,940
What a pity!

485
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:20,940
Such a good daughter.

486
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:22,940
I wanted to keep her

487
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:24,940
for the rest of my life.

488
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:28,940
What does her father think of her?

489
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:30,940
Isn't it hurting her daughter?

490
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:34,940
Let's go back.

491
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:36,940
In a few days,

492
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:38,940
Chief Mao will come to Shanghai Station

493
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:40,940
to guide her work.

494
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:42,940
She can't be alone.

495
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:46,940
This place is very special.

496
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:48,940
Today,

497
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:50,940
we'll let their parents take care of the work.

498
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,940
Tomorrow, we'll investigate the case.

499
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:00,940
The doctors we can find

500
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:02,940
have been sent back to the troupe.

501
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:04,940
When Mengjie arrives, I'll report to the old school.

502
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:06,940
The other doctors are missing.

503
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:08,940
We'll find more time.

504
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:10,940
Let's send them away first.

505
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:12,940
We don't want to wake up too late.

506
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:14,940
Let me go!

507
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:16,940
Where are you taking me?

508
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:20,940
Let me go!

509
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:24,940
Let me go!

510
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:30,940
Let me go!

511
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:38,940
Let me go!

512
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:42,940
Let's go.

513
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:02,940
Father!

514
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:04,940
Father!

515
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:06,940
Father!

516
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:08,940
Father!

517
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:10,940
Father!

518
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:12,940
Father!

519
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:14,940
Father!

520
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:16,940
Father!

521
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:18,940
Father!

522
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:36,020
I'll blow the top part of the disciple's story to make him disappear.

523
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:38,020
I already did that once.

524
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:49,060
Protect our highway in core and

525
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:51,660
This is the general's case.

526
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:54,860
It seems their case's been często paid off yet.

527
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:56,300
Don't worry about it.

528
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:58,300
Japanese military hospital is involved in the earthquake

529
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:02,300
Yes

530
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:04,300
But...

531
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:07,300
Did you testify against the government?

532
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:10,300
I did

533
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:13,300
But I did it for...

534
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:14,300
Enough!

535
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:17,300
Meng Shui, help yourself!

536
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:20,300
Read!

537
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:27,300
Meng Jie, the daughter of the chief of the Ministry of Health of the Wangwei government, Meng Ni Mingyi

538
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:31,300
has been confirmed to be a victim of the Japanese military

539
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:34,300
She was accused of treason and attempted to murder

540
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:36,300
She was found guilty of treason

541
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:38,300
The witness admitted that she was innocent

542
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:40,300
She is under arrest

543
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:44,300
I am not a traitor!

544
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:46,300
I am not a traitor!

545
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:48,300
Your father is a cowardly traitor!

546
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:51,300
If you really are a traitor, why don't you take her?

547
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:00,300
Is my brother Shixian here?

548
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:03,300
I want to see him

549
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:08,300
I am not a traitor!

550
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:10,300
I am not!

551
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:13,300
I want to see Shixian!

552
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:17,300
I am not a traitor!

553
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:20,300
I am not a traitor!

554
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:44,300
At present, our work in the police is a legal reform and punishment of the traitor's regulations, which has been passed in the Republic for 27 years

555
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:46,300
This way, this way

556
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:59,300
At this point, I am here on behalf of the Shanghai Police Committee to guarantee to the public that the work of the National Government is absolutely fair

557
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:15,300
Be careful

558
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:21,300
During the war, if there is a lot of evil,

559
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:23,300
destroying the war,

560
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:31,300
or the most obvious person who is accused of treason by the Japanese military,

561
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:35,300
we welcome the public to actively review the case

562
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:43,300
If there are 14 people who are considered traitors in the documents of the National Government,

563
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:47,300
we will strictly punish them and never let them down

564
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:58,300
We promise that the traitor of the Han State will be punished

565
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:02,300
and the traitor of the Han State will be punished

566
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:07,300
We will punish the traitor

567
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:25,300
We welcome the public and our friends to the capital

568
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:27,300
We welcome the public and our friends to the capital

569
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:34,300
Boss, here is the newspaper

570
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:36,300
Let me see what I can do

571
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:38,300
These traitors, what are they doing?

572
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:39,300
Selling newspapers, selling newspapers

573
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:40,300
Come on, distribute

574
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:41,300
I dare not

575
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:52,300
This is not fresh

576
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:53,300
No, no

577
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:57,300
It's not fresh

578
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:57,300
The people who are suffering under the surface of the sea

579
00:42:57,300 --> 00:43:00,300
are not clear about the truth

580
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:03,300
Where is the wind going?

581
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:05,300
Whose window is shaking?

582
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:07,300
Whose voice is hoarse?

583
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:10,300
The heart is thinking,

584
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:12,300
whether it is you or me,

585
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:14,300
I am feeling

586
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:16,300
He is watching

587
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:20,300
In the vast night

588
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:23,300
The tears are falling

589
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:27,300
The pain of a fallen soldier

590
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:31,300
He is watching

591
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:34,300
Wandering in the shadow

592
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:38,300
The night falls

593
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:40,300
The night is bright

594
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:45,300
He is watching

595
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:49,300
In the vast night

596
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:53,300
The tears are falling

597
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:56,300
The pain of a fallen soldier

598
00:43:58,300 --> 00:44:00,300
He is watching

599
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:03,300
Wandering in the shadow

600
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:07,300
The night falls

601
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:09,300
The night is bright

602
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:14,300
The night falls

603
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:17,300
The night is bright

604
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:23,300
The night is bright

605
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:28,300
The night is bright
