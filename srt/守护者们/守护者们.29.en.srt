Doe

43
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,600
'd

44
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,600
I'm sorry.

45
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:57,600
The patient's brain was damaged by an emergency surgery, but the colon was not saved.

46
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,600
What are you talking about?

47
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:05,600
If Dr. Edward was in a coma, he would have been a little better.

48
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,600
I'm sorry.

49
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,600
I'm sorry.

50
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,600
I'm sorry.

51
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,600
I'm sorry.

52
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,600
I'm sorry.

53
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,600
I'm sorry.

54
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,600
I'm sorry.

55
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,600
I'm sorry.

56
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,600
I'm sorry.

57
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,600
I'm sorry.

58
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,600
I'm sorry.

59
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:21,600
The patient may have been a little better, but I'm sorry.

60
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,600
Get out of my sight!

61
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:37,600
Sasaki, I will definitely kill you!

62
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,600
Sasaki!

63
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,600
Master.

64
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,600
Yes.

65
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,600
How is Master?

66
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,600
Master is still the same.

67
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,600
Have you touched the location?

68
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,600
Yes, the Yuyue Pavilion.

69
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,600
Good.

70
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:16,600
Help me copy the evidence of Liang Jinyuan going to the Yuyue Pavilion in the past half year.

71
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,600
Tomorrow morning, the Secret Service will check it.

72
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,600
So the action will be fast.

73
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,600
Here.

74
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,600
This is Liang Jinyuan's letter.

75
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,600
Be careful not to imitate her handwriting.

76
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,600
I know, Master.

77
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,600
Wait.

78
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,600
Take these.

79
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,600
Take two tickets to Hong Kong.

80
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,600
Take the rest.

81
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,600
Thank you, Master.

82
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,600
Thank you.

83
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,600
Don't you want to take revenge on Zuo Zuo?

84
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,600
I will fulfill your wish now.

85
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,600
I will fulfill your wish now.

86
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,600
What about the other two?

87
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,600
After you fulfill your wish,

88
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,600
I can spare your wife.

89
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:46,600
Can you really believe this Sakishin Shinazin?

90
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,600
Do you know about our plan?

91
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,600
Does he have any other choice?

92
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,600
No.

93
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:58,600
I can't let him go alone.

94
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,600
I want Yasuo to die.

95
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,600
If he comes back,

96
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:06,600
I will break the promise with the Japanese.

97
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,600
This is a dead end.

98
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,600
I swear I will live in peace

99
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,600
from now on.

100
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,600
Master,

101
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:27,600
I can't let him go alone.

102
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,600
I swear I will live in peace.

103
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,600
Thank you.

104
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,600
Everyone,

105
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,600
tonight,

106
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,600
we will face a war.

107
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,600
The victory of this war

108
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,600
is the pride and glory of the Toen clan.

109
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:13,600
Sasaki clan will take these away from you.

110
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,600
Are you angry?

111
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,600
Yes.

112
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,600
Then fight with me.

113
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,600
Yes.

114
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,600
We have been talking about this.

115
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,600
We are in the same line of thought.

116
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,600
Toen clan

117
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,600
Toen clan

118
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,600
Did you solve the problem of Yasuo?

119
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,600
Yasuo has a list of the members of the Toen clan

120
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,600
in the family name list.

121
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,600
We need to confirm the truth.

122
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,600
We will fight after confirming.

123
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,600
Do you still believe in Yuzo?

124
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,600
Of course not.

125
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,600
But to Yuzo,

126
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,600
Liang Jinyuan is his enemy.

127
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,600
This is one.

128
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:46,600
The second is a great achievement.

129
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,600
Yuzo will not give up.

130
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,600
Is there any problem with the radio station?

131
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,600
The radio station is too big.

132
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,600
If we go out,

133
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,600
it will be too far.

134
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,600
I will find something unnecessary.

135
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,600
Wait.

136
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,600
This is the radio station for the assassination.

137
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,600
Where are you taking him?

138
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,600
Do you still want to stay

139
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,600
and execute that evil operation?

140
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,600
Are you going to die, Gu Xiaoshan?

141
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,600
Luohan, I didn't have time to explain to you.

142
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,600
Next, I will fake the evidence

143
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,600
that Liang Jinyuan went to the hospital.

144
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,600
Let Zuo Zumu think he is your accomplice.

145
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,600
Only if Sasaki killed him

146
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,600
and clean up the body.

147
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,600
Then

148
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,600
Then he is the one who took you away

149
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,600
and hurt Jun Tong.

150
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,600
He also killed the real murderer of Zuo Zumu's son.

151
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,600
But no one will suspect me.

152
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,600
I can continue to execute the assassination.

153
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,600
And then?

154
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,600
Then you can stay

155
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,600
and continue to cooperate with Ding Yi and others.

156
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,600
What?

157
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,600
Don't you understand?

158
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,600
The problem now is not with Zuo Zumu.

159
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,600
The password has become a dead end.

160
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,600
Since they dare to steal the password from me publicly,

161
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,600
it is already a disgrace.

162
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,600
They can't stay like you.

163
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,600
Come back to Chongqing with me.

164
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,600
I won't go back to Chongqing.

165
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,600
I won't go anywhere

166
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,600
until the assassination is completed.

167
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,600
No matter what the password is,

168
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,600
I am still in the meeting of the committee of the Qingxiang committee.

169
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,600
I still have a chance.

170
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,600
Then why?

171
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,600
Why did I leave?

172
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,600
I want to ask you this question more than you.

173
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,600
Why did you do this to me?

174
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,600
Lu Huan,

175
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,600
since you came back from Yuwen Pavilion,

176
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,600
you have been talking to me for a long time.

177
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,600
What do you want to express to me?

178
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,600
Okay,

179
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,600
give me some more time.

180
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,600
I will let Ding Yi go out, okay?

181
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,600
But I tell you,

182
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,600
the assassination must continue.

183
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,600
If you insist on staying,

184
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,600
wait for me to report back to Chongqing,

185
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,600
Secretary Mao

186
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,600
will naturally send someone to solve them.

187
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,600
It won't affect your action.

188
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,600
My action?

189
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,600
Is this my action?

190
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,600
Don't be bold.

191
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,600
Let you deal with him

192
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,600
and persuade me to raise me.

193
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,600
The intelligence staff are all in control.

194
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,600
I must report you for the crime of treason.

195
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,600
In case the incident happens,

196
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,600
the vice-commander will hold you back.

197
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,600
I will be the scapegoat.

198
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,600
Gu Yangshan,

199
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,600
I don't want to think

200
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,600
that I don't know why you stayed.

201
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,600
You didn't execute the assassination for the party,

202
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,600
but you wanted to execute the assassination

203
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,600
with the Communist Party.

204
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,600
Say it again.

205
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,600
Sorry.

206
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,600
Sorry.

207
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,600
Let's go.

208
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,600
I don't understand why.

209
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,600
Why did we

210
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,600
start on the same path?

211
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,600
But as we walked,

212
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,600
we were scattered.

213
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,600
It's not scattered.

214
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,600
We never walked on the same path.

215
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,600
I shouldn't have been with you from the beginning.

216
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,600
I should have been with you.

217
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,600
I should have been with you.

218
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,600
I should have been with you.

219
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,600
Because I'm not you.

220
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,600
I can't stand it.

221
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,600
I can't stand it.

222
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,600
Please tell the president of the party

223
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,600
that the meeting is over.

224
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,600
Yes, sir.

225
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,600
Gu Yangshan,

226
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,600
have you brought the food and the carriage?

227
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,600
Yes.

228
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,600
I called the military police headquarters earlier,

229
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,600
but they said they were leaving already.

230
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,600
Hurry up and find them.

231
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,600
I can't wait any longer.

232
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,600
Go.

233
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,600
Hurry up and leave.

234
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,600
Yes, sir.

235
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,600
Did you bring the food and the carriage?

236
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,600
Did you bring the food and the carriage?

237
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,600
It was just right.

238
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,600
Take the food and the carriage

239
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,600
and take Mr. Li to the police station.

240
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,600
Yes, sir.

241
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,600
Go.

242
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,600
Go.

243
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,600
Magmi.

244
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,600
What?

245
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,600
You're going to die.

246
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,600
Major,

247
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,600
the Eastern Courtyard is going to kill you.

248
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,600
We're here.

249
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,600
We're here.

250
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,600
We're here.

251
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,600
We're here.

252
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,600
We're here.

253
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:57,600
You're going to die, Mr. Li.

254
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,600
Li!

255
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,600
Jin Mi.

256
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:26,600
Li!

257
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:27,600
What did you do?

258
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,600
Major,

259
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,600
the Eastern Courtyard's officer has died.

260
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,600
Now, the Eastern Courtyard's family

261
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,600
thinks that you killed him.

262
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,600
So they want me to avenge you.

263
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,600
But I know very well

264
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,600
that it was all the plan of Lin Dai Hui.

265
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,600
He wanted me to die with you,

266
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,600
but I didn't want to die.

267
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,600
I want to make a deal with you.

268
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,600
I killed the officer?

269
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,600
What are you talking about?

270
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,600
You're in the way of the ceremony,

271
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,600
and you surprised your son

272
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,600
and made him go home.

273
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,600
So I have to kill you.

274
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,600
What do you want?

275
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,600
You want to make a deal with me?

276
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,600
Can we talk now?

277
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,600
Stop!

278
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,600
Don't move!

279
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,600
There's an ambush outside.

280
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,600
You'll die if you go out.

281
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,600
Evacuate the school.

282
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,600
Evacuate the school!

283
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,600
Li,

284
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,600
what is the Eastern Courtyard planning?

285
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,600
I want to know that.

286
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,600
Lin Dai Hui wants to kill you

287
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,600
and avenge you.

288
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,600
But he knows that there must be many guards

289
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,600
in the school.

290
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,600
They will attack from outside.

291
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,600
I'm sure that Lin Dai Hui

292
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,600
won't make it.

293
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,600
So,

294
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,600
he used my wife's life

295
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,600
to threaten me

296
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,600
and let me bomb you

297
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,600
with explosives.

298
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,600
Just now,

299
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,600
as soon as he pulled the hidden wire on me,

300
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,600
all the people here

301
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,600
would have died.

302
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,600
If they heard the explosion,

303
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,600
they would all rush in

304
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,600
and destroy the last fire.

305
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,600
Why did you kill me?

306
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,600
Shao Jiang,

307
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,600
you have a private radio.

308
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,600
A few days ago,

309
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,600
I sent a secret message.

310
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,600
The message was

311
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,600
to block the top floor

312
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,600
and turn it into a medical center.

313
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,600
Am I right?

314
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,600
There are many doctors outside.

315
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,600
They can't operate on the workers.

316
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,600
That's why the workers

317
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,600
are not treated.

318
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,600
And Lin Dai Hui

319
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,600
has found your private radio.

320
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,600
So,

321
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,600
about this matter,

322
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,600
Lin Dai Hui is dead.

323
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,600
You did it.

324
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,600
You can't deny it.

325
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,600
The hospital's secret

326
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,600
is still not out.

327
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,600
It has nothing to do with it.

328
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,600
But even your bodyguard

329
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,600
has been arrested by Lin Dai Hui.

330
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,600
If this bodyguard

331
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,600
tells you his name,

332
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,600
do you think

333
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,600
the military

334
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,600
will believe in his death?

335
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,600
Does it have nothing to do with you?

336
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,600
Li,

337
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,600
tell me your condition.

338
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,600
My wife

339
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,600
is now being held in the army hospital

340
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,600
by Lin Dai Hui.

341
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,600
Now,

342
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,600
tell your people

343
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,600
to go and save my wife.

344
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,600
My wife knows where Lin Dai Hui

345
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,600
has kept your bodyguard.

346
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,600
And she can help you

347
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,600
to get all the evidence back.

348
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,600
You are a good man.

349
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,600
But you can't understand

350
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,600
what I'm saying.

351
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,600
You are the only one

352
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,600
who can understand the Toun case.

353
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,600
What are you doing?

354
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,600
This is my city.

355
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,600
From now on,

356
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,600
I, Li Yuan Sang,

357
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,600
will be the head of Dongyuan Temple.

358
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,600
I will be the head of Dongyuan Temple.

359
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,600
Is there any movement?

360
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,600
Nothing has changed.

361
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,600
The Toun case

362
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,600
It's getting interesting.

363
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,600
The world is getting more and more interesting.

364
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,600
BUS.

365
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,600
Soon,

366
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,600
I will rescue my wife

367
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,600
at the hospital's secret base.

368
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,600
But,

369
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,600
I have to tell you

370
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,600
everything you know

371
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,600
here.

372
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,600
I will also

373
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,600
kill my wife

374
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,600
in front of my men.

375
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,600
Contact the hospital.

376
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,600
Yes.

377
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,600
Kida, contact the hospital.

378
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,600
Yes.

379
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,600
Shao Jian,

380
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,600
we don't have time.

381
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,600
Now, Lin Dai Hui

382
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,600
is hiding the people

383
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,600
who are in the Dongyuan Temple's house.

384
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,600
I've been in there for a long time.

385
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,600
Before the explosion,

386
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,600
she will be suspicious.

387
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,600
She will rush in right away.

388
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,600
Then, she will be hurt twice as much as you.

389
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,600
The reason she sent you here

390
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,600
is because

391
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,600
she is not prepared

392
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,600
to fight with her own will.

393
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,600
I will tell you everything

394
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,600
with confidence.

395
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,600
Where is our headquarter?

396
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,600
Where is it?

397
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,600
Where is our headquarter?

398
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,600
My son,

399
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:07,600
Lin Dai Hui said

400
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,600
that he had poison

401
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,600
in the stone of Edouard.

402
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,600
Poison?

403
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,600
Yes.

404
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,600
Now, Lin Dai Hui

405
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,600
is still spreading rumors.

406
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,600
She saw the first night

407
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,600
of Edouard's poisoning.

408
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,600
She wanted a tiger's mouth

409
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,600
to take the people who were injured

410
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,600
to become doctors.

411
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,600
And she gave Edouard

412
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,600
a poison file.

413
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,600
It's a mess.

414
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,600
Taro is a private scholar.

415
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,600
He has never closed a garden.

416
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,600
He is a vicious man.

417
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,600
But with the tiger's mouth

418
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,600
and the scar on his face,

419
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:41,600
and your secret palace,

420
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,600
it's enough

421
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,600
for Lin Dai Hui

422
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,600
to bite you to death

423
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,600
in front of the military.

424
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,600
If Taro was alive,

425
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,600
her lies would have been proved right away.

426
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,600
How stupid are the people of the Tōwan family?

427
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,600
Young Master,

428
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,600
don't you think that

429
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,600
now you think

430
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,600
Taro

431
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,600
was assassinated

432
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,600
by anti-Japanese?

433
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,600
Lin Dai Hui!

434
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,600
Young Master,

435
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,600
the people of the Tōwan family

436
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,600
are outside.

437
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,600
With your power,

438
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,600
you can take advantage of the opportunity

439
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,600
to take her away.

440
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,600
If the military asks,

441
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,600
all the soldiers here

442
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,600
can testify for you.

443
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,600
The Tōwan family is the first to act.

444
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,600
And you,

445
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,600
are just the only one.

446
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,600
Hayashi-san!

447
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,600
I will take you to the museum!

448
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,600
Hayashi-san!

449
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,600
I will take you to the museum!

450
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,600
Hayashi-san!

451
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,600
I will take you to the museum!

452
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,600
Hayashi-san!

453
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,600
Hi, Sisa!

454
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,600
Hi, Sisa!

455
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:07,600
Hi, Sisa!

456
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,600
Anima Shuka?

457
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,600
Yes.

458
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,600
Banana.

459
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,600
I'm sorry.

460
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,600
According to the information we have from the hospital,

461
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,600
the citizens are already searching for our telegraph station.

462
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,600
But the one who is in charge is waiting for us.

463
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:03,600
I think that Megumi Hayashi is reporting to the military with our memories.

464
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,600
Kill the traitor.

465
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:11,600
And tell her that we will bring Shen Biyun here.

466
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:13,600
I have something to ask her.

467
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,600
Yes.

468
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,600
How is it, young master?

469
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,600
I didn't lie to you.

470
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,600
Call Megumi Hayashi here and explain to her.

471
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,600
You want to talk to Lin Nanhui?

472
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,600
But she has a guilty conscience.

473
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,600
She thinks that there is a trap in her heart.

474
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,600
She will not come in at all.

475
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:46,600
If I let her come here,

476
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,600
what should I do?

477
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,600
I will kill her.

478
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,600
Hayashi! Hayashi! Hayashi!

479
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,600
Finally.

480
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,600
Follow me.

481
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,600
Yes!

482
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:27,600
Hurry up!

483
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:39,600
Let's go.

484
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,600
Yes.

485
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:57,600
Megumi,

486
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,600
did you really want to kill me?

487
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:06,600
I reported to the police about the murder of the prince.

488
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:12,600
If you take the trial and tell me everything,

489
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,600
the Tōon case is not over.

490
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,600
I will not let you go.

491
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,600
I will not let you go.

492
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:21,600
I will not let you go.

493
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,600
I will not let you go.

494
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,600
If you tell me everything,

495
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,600
the Tōon case is still under control.

496
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,600
Otherwise,

497
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,600
the military will definitely correct the Tōon case

498
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:37,600
with the charges of internal conflict.

499
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,600
Think carefully.

500
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,600
The Tōon case is still under control.

501
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,600
Otherwise,

502
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,600
the military will definitely correct the Tōon case

503
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,600
with the charges of internal conflict.

504
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:58,600
I saw your son kill Edward-sensei with my own eyes.

505
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,600
Is this also a confession?

506
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,600
That liar is...

507
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:09,600
What about Li Yue-se?

508
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,600
He is a fake.

509
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,600
His name is Ding Yi.

510
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,600
He is a well-known scholar.

511
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:34,920
He killed the real Li Yue-se and became a

512
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,600
fake.

513
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:44,600
He will tell everyone that I am just an actor in my wife's troupe.

514
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,600
He will even insult me and say that I am not a blind man.

515
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,600
Young general, he is already crazy.

516
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,600
He wants to inherit the Tōon family.

517
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,600
He can say anything.

518
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,600
But you should know that

519
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:05,600
I have worked with him for a long time.

520
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,600
If I were not Li Yue-se,

521
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,600
how could I know how to design the code

522
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,600
and solve problems for him?

523
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,600
Do you really think that

524
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:22,600
the real Young General is a fool?

525
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,600
Yes, of course.

526
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,600
All the information systems in Shanghai,

527
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:37,600
China, and China have been turned around by an actor.

528
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,600
What a fool!

529
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,600
Lin Nai-hui!

530
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:49,600
You are not qualified to be the head of the Imperial Army.

531
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:53,600
You are involved in the death of Taro,

532
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,600
who you will hear only one last time.

533
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:57,600
Did you hear that?

534
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,600
Unfortunately, it has nothing to do with me.

535
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:05,600
But your death will be a consequence of my relationship with you.

536
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,600
Go!

537
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,600
Go to hell!

538
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,600
Go to hell!

539
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,600
No!

540
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:27,600
You came first!

541
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,600
Go to hell!

542
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,600
You are a liar!

543
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,600
Go to hell!

544
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:48,600
Go to hell!

545
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,600
Go to hell!

546
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,600
Joseph!

547
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,600
Joseph!

548
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,600
Joseph!

549
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:43,600
Joseph!

550
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,600
Joseph!

551
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,600
I saw the coat they gave you.

552
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,600
I know how to untie it.

553
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,600
Can you still hold on?

554
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,600
Okay.

555
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,600
Okay.

556
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:59,600
I'll go.

557
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:09,600
I'll go.

558
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,600
I'll go.

559
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:09,600
Hold on.

560
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,600
Hold on.

561
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,600
I'll go.

562
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,600
Hey!

563
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:34,600
Hey!

564
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:37,600
Hey!

565
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,600
Please don't come in!

566
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:41,600
The bullets are...

567
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:42,600
The bullets are in the bomb!

568
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:43,600
The bomb...

569
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:44,600
There's a bomb!

570
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:45,600
Please don't come in!

571
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,600
No!

572
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:17,600
No!

573
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,600
Your right hand is the only one that can reach me.

574
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:28,600
I'll walk with you.

575
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:30,600
Take it slow.

576
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:31,600
I'll walk with you.

577
