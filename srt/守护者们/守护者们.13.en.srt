We found a

00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:15,280
Okay.

58
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:38,280
It's the code of such a device,

59
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:44,340
Go!

60
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:45,820
letter

61
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:46,940
Open!

letter

cover

64
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,000
Let's go, catch her!

65
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,140
Charlie, Charlie!

66
00:02:58,820 --> 00:02:59,340
Mr. Lee.

67
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,740
Charlie!

68
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:03,140
this way!

69
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:05,140
You son of a bitch!

70
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:19,140
Don't get her!

71
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:04,300
Get in, hurry up!

72
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,500
The rabbit is making its way out

73
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:35,140
What are you doing?

74
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:47,140
Let's go!

75
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:49,140
Let's go!

76
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:51,140
Let's go!

77
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:53,140
Hurry!

78
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:55,140
Hurry!

79
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:05,140
Let's go!

80
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:23,140
Captain.

81
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:25,140
Did you take the US and Charlie to the ship?

82
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:27,140
Yes, I did.

83
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:31,140
Mino Uwai and the Temurakas are with me.

84
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:35,140
Oh my gosh.

85
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:43,140
KLX 83.

86
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:47,140
You must stop your ship right now.

87
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:49,140
Immediately for our inspection.

88
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:53,140
KLX 83.

89
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:55,140
You must stop your ship right now.

90
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:57,140
Now!

91
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:03,140
Take!

92
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:27,140
Let's go!

93
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:49,140
Sir, can you tell me what is happening?

94
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:51,140
Where are you going?

95
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:57,140
Sir, I think this is the office.

96
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:59,140
Oh my god!

97
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:09,140
I am the captain.

98
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:11,140
What right do you have to stop our merchant ship?

99
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:13,140
Shut up!

100
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:15,140
What's the meaning of this?

101
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:17,140
We are the founders of the Japanese Empire.

102
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:19,140
We are the founders of the Japanese Empire.

103
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:21,140
Shut up!

104
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:23,140
What's the meaning of this?

105
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:25,140
We are the founders of the Japanese Empire.

106
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:27,140
We are the founders of the Japanese Empire.

107
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:29,140
I don't understand what you are saying.

108
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:31,140
I don't understand what you are saying.

109
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:33,140
I don't understand what you are saying.

110
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:35,140
I don't understand what you are saying.

111
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:53,140
I don't have time to explain everything to you.

112
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:55,140
Get out of my way!

113
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:03,140
Sir!

114
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:11,140
Sir!

115
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:21,140
Sir!

116
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:23,140
Sir!

117
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:25,140
What are you doing?

118
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:31,140
Hey, over there!

119
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:37,140
Sir!

120
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:41,140
Hey! Don't shoot!

121
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:43,140
I said don't shoot!

122
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:45,140
Don't shoot!

123
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:47,140
What are you doing?

124
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:49,140
I said don't shoot!

125
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:55,140
I said don't shoot!

126
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:59,140
I told you to stop shooting!

127
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:01,140
I'm sorry!

128
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,140
What are you doing?

129
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:21,140
Sir!

130
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:25,140
The USR is afraid of us being charged with a crime.

131
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:27,140
So we took a risk.

132
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:29,140
After that, we found him.

133
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:31,140
We killed him right there.

134
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:38,140
This is the evidence that the USR was collecting information

135
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:41,140
that we had collected from the investigation.

136
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:49,140
Mr. Ohtien, where did you go?

137
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:53,140
I'm going to kill you.

138
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:17,140
You didn't die?

139
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:19,140
Mr. Ohtien.

140
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:21,140
You really want me to die?

141
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:27,140
What's going on?

142
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:31,140
The road is on fire.

143
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:33,140
The fire is very big.

144
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:35,140
You're not here.

145
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:37,140
So I had to come to you.

146
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:47,140
Sir.

147
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:49,140
I don't know what kind of kid the USR is

148
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:51,140
and why he came here.

149
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:53,140
But those photos are evidence

150
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:55,140
that the USR was working on information.

151
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:57,140
It's a false evidence.

152
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:01,140
I have a photo of you.

153
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:03,140
What photo?

154
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:05,140
The photo of

155
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:07,140
Charlie and Wango

156
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:09,140
in the US.

157
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:11,140
The one with Frank.

158
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:13,140
The Englishman.

159
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:15,140
Miss Qian

160
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:17,140
and the Englishman

161
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:19,140
are always close.

162
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:21,140
I think it's not strange that they're together.

163
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:23,140
But Mr. Ohtien

164
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:25,140
still has doubts

165
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:27,140
about the contents of the photos.

166
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:29,140
You can ask Miss Qian

167
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:31,140
in person.

168
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:33,140
That's good.

169
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:37,140
I'll ask Mr. Shen to come to the USR.

170
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:39,140
I'll ask Miss Qian to come to the USR.

171
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:56,700
The USR's

172
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:03,140
Mr. Li, get away.

173
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:05,140
Mr. Li.

174
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:07,140
You're hurt, right?

175
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:09,140
No.

176
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:11,140
Just go.

177
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:13,140
They told me

178
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:14,140
The moon is on fire.

179
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:15,140
You scared me.

180
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:17,140
It's okay.

181
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:18,140
I'm glad I took the wrong one.

182
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:19,140
I'll be fine.

183
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:21,140
Miss Chen,

184
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:23,140
please explain

185
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:25,140
the contents of these photos.

186
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:41,140
Chief Wutian,

187
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:43,140
you sent someone to stalk me?

188
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:50,140
If it wasn't someone stalking you,

189
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:53,140
we wouldn't have found you

190
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:55,140
in the middle of the night.

191
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:02,140
After the investigation,

192
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:04,140
we found out that

193
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:07,140
you and the vice president of the British crew,

194
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:09,140
Frank, were together.

195
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:11,140
So we suspect that

196
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:14,140
the US gave our secret method

197
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:16,140
to this Frank

198
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:18,140
from the beginning.

199
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:20,140
This is the first time

200
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:23,140
that the intelligence agency has been exposed.

201
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:25,140
It turns out that

202
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:27,140
this Frank has been

203
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,140
the first to be arrested

204
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:32,140
by the US.

205
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:36,140
Frank is my old friend.

206
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:38,140
How can I

207
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:40,140
send information

208
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:42,140
to a friend?

209
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:44,140
But this is impossible.

210
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:47,140
You met five times in a row.

211
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:49,140
And every time

212
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:51,140
you left the US,

213
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:53,140
you went to see him.

214
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:54,140
Excuse me,

215
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:56,140
what kind of friend

216
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:58,140
needs such an ordinary ID?

217
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:02,140
I'll explain it to you privately.

218
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:05,140
But I want to hear it now.

219
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:12,140
Mr. President,

220
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:14,140
can I say something?

221
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:25,140
The reason why I met Frank frequently

222
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:27,140
is because we were going to talk about

223
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:29,140
the issue of the release of Asia's God of War

224
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:30,140
in the public sector.

225
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:32,140
Mr. President hopes that

226
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:34,140
our film has at least

227
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:35,140
80% of the film.

228
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:37,140
And we will keep

229
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:39,140
some of the private part

230
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:40,140
of the film on the fly.

231
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:43,140
The negotiation is very tough.

232
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:45,140
I need to communicate with both parties frequently.

233
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:46,140
So every time I go out

234
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:48,140
from Mr. President's office,

235
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:50,140
I will meet Frank directly.

236
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:01,140
But I'm doing this

237
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:02,140
for the sake of the country.

238
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:06,140
The map you gave to the US,

239
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:09,140
is it also for the film?

240
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:12,140
Map?

241
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:20,140
You think you can make a movie

242
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:22,140
with your family

243
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:24,140
and hide the intelligence

244
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:25,140
in a safe place?

245
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:28,140
We can't find it?

246
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:31,140
No.

247
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:38,140
The map you gave to the US

248
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:41,140
is it also for the film?

249
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,140
It's for the film.

250
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:46,140
How do you know the Englishman's boat?

251
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:48,140
How many boats do you have tonight?

252
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:50,140
How many?

253
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:56,140
You have to report this.

254
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:58,140
This is...

255
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:01,140
What do you mean?

256
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:12,140
I...

257
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:14,140
I'm doing this for Frank.

258
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,140
I handed the safe note to Mr. Li.

259
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:18,140
But why is it the map

260
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:19,140
and not the US?

261
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:20,140
I don't know.

262
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:21,140
Mr. Li!

263
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:23,140
I...

264
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:25,140
I don't know.

265
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:27,140
What map?

266
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:30,140
You don't know?

267
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:32,140
Charlie doesn't know?

268
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:33,140
You just found out,

269
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:34,140
Charlie just found out.

270
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:36,140
Charlie?

271
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:37,140
Oh, right.

272
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:39,140
Where's Charlie?

273
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:41,140
I don't know.

274
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:42,140
Charlie?

275
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:48,140
I'm afraid you don't know.

276
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:52,140
How about I tell you?

277
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,140
Charlie...

278
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:01,140
Charlie!

279
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:03,140
Come in.

280
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:05,140
I told you there's nothing here.

281
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,140
Why did you steal my box?

282
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:13,140
Miss Xian?

283
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:15,140
Why are you here?

284
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,140
Who is he?

285
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,140
He...

286
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:25,140
He's a member of the US.

287
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:26,140
Charlie...

288
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:30,140
Charlie.

289
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:31,140
Mr. Li.

290
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:32,140
Why are you here?

291
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:35,140
Mr. Li, I went to get...

292
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:38,140
After I finished my work,

293
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,140
I went back to the hospital.

294
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:40,140
I found the hospital was on fire.

295
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:41,140
I couldn't find you.

296
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:43,140
I came back to ask if you were at the toilet.

297
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:45,140
I came here quickly.

298
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:46,140
But they didn't let me in.

299
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:48,140
I just made a fuss and broke in.

300
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:49,140
Charlie!

301
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:57,140
What's in your hand?

302
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:59,140
Nothing.

303
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:00,140
Open it.

304
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:01,140
This is Mr. Li's stuff.

305
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:02,140
I can't open it.

306
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:03,140
Charlie!

307
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:04,140
Don't touch it.

308
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:05,140
Give it to me.

309
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:06,140
Give it to me.

310
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:14,140
What's this?

311
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:22,140
I asked Charlie to get these.

312
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:25,140
That map and the signal are for Charlie.

313
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:32,140
But there's no evidence on the map.

314
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:36,140
Map.

315
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:37,140
Map.

316
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:43,140
What are you doing?

317
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:45,140
Hand.

318
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:47,140
Hand.

319
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:48,140
Give it to me.

320
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:54,140
Touch it.

321
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:57,140
Feel it.

322
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:58,140
It's really blood.

323
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:00,140
It's a blind man.

324
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,140
Wine.

325
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:06,140
It's a fake.

326
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:12,140
If you don't believe me,

327
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:14,140
you can ask the blind man to translate it.

328
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:15,140
And let the audience know.

329
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:19,140
Waiter!

330
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:23,140
Check it out.

331
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:31,140
You promised me

332
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:35,140
you wouldn't drink before you recovered.

333
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:39,140
But if it's a fake,

334
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:44,140
why did you make it so mysterious?

335
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:46,140
I don't want to make it so mysterious.

336
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:48,140
It's just a bottle of wine.

337
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:51,140
But Captain Lin refused.

338
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:55,140
Captain Kobayashi asked me to do it.

339
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:57,140
Miss Xian said I was hurt.

340
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:59,140
She said if I drank again,

341
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:00,140
it would be bad for my health.

342
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:01,140
She told me to quit drinking.

343
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:04,140
I was so in love with her

344
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:07,140
that I agreed to her request.

345
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:08,140
But...

346
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:12,140
But I really have a big eye.

347
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:14,140
I just found out

348
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:16,140
there's a British merchant ship from the sky.

349
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:19,140
There's a batch of my favorite whiskey on the ship.

350
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:20,140
But Captain Lin

351
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:23,140
didn't allow me to leave the hospital.

352
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,140
So I had to do it.

353
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:30,140
Sorry, Melle.

354
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:32,140
I...

355
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:33,140
I lied to you.

356
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:37,140
If you want to drink,

357
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:40,140
just tell Chief Wuting.

358
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:42,140
I don't think he'll stop you.

359
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:44,140
He's so bold.

360
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:48,140
How did it go?

361
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:52,140
Captain.

362
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:54,140
He did say

363
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:56,140
not to let Lin Yue-su

364
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:58,140
leave the hospital

365
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:00,140
freely.

366
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:01,140
He told me to do it.

367
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:04,140
So I refused.

368
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:06,140
Excuse me.

369
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:07,140
Come in.

370
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:11,140
Did you find out?

371
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:13,140
He said he'd be drinking tonight.

372
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,140
Yes.

373
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:22,140
He said he'd be drinking tonight.

374
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:26,140
You guys are crazy!

375
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:28,140
Captain.

376
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:30,140
You can't trust them.

377
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:33,140
They made this up.

378
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:36,140
You don't believe us?

379
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:41,140
I found Lin Yue-su.

380
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:44,140
My wife went to the ship.

381
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:47,140
Lin Yue-su went to the ship.

382
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:49,140
Charlie wanted to make

383
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:52,140
Lin Yue-su get out of the ship.

384
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:53,140
But...

385
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:57,140
Lin, Jin-sheng and Mutsu

386
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:59,140
saw it.

387
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:02,140
When we were in the team,

388
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:04,140
Lin Yue-su's car

389
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:07,140
was obviously parked on the dock.

390
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:12,140
Your initial plan

391
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:14,140
was to escape.

392
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:16,140
I decided to make your bed.

393
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:18,140
You're afraid of the ship

394
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:19,140
and the ship.

395
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:21,140
So you made up this lie

396
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:23,140
to deceive us.

397
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:25,140
Chief Wu Tian.

398
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:27,140
Who's going to tell us the truth?

399
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:30,140
You can't even see the car.

400
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,140
You said Mr. Li was shot

401
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:32,140
and fell into the river.

402
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:34,140
Mr. Li was sitting here.

403
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:35,140
You said I jumped into the river

404
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:36,140
to save Mr. Li.

405
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:38,140
I'm wearing this suit today.

406
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:39,140
The suit is still dry.

407
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:41,140
You're lying.

408
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:42,140
Enough!

409
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:44,140
Enough! Enough!

410
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:49,140
What did I do wrong?

411
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:50,140
Chief Wu Tian

412
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:53,140
must have targeted me like this.

413
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:55,140
He even made up

414
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:57,140
such a ridiculous lie.

415
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:59,140
He must have framed me.

416
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:03,140
Why did I design this password

417
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:05,140
for you in my suit?

418
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:08,140
It was to make Lu Jun's password system

419
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:10,140
completely out of the navy.

420
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,140
I listened to him

421
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:14,140
and did everything I could

422
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:15,140
to design this

423
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:17,140
ridiculous code for you.

424
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:19,140
For example,

425
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:20,140
you should have

426
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:21,140
given up your weapons.

427
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:22,140
But now

428
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:25,140
Chief Wu Tian is targeting me everywhere.

429
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:26,140
He even suspected

430
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:28,140
that I leaked the code.

431
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,140
You all know

432
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:30,140
that this code system

433
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:31,140
is designed by me.

434
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:33,140
I don't know the secret key.

435
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:34,140
How can I leak this code

436
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:36,140
completely?

437
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:39,140
If I really leaked this code,

438
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:41,140
why did I remind you

439
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:43,140
about this?

440
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:46,140
Now I'm in the meeting room

441
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:47,140
begging Chief Wu Tian

442
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:49,140
to stop using this code

443
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:50,140
for a while

444
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:51,140
and try to test

445
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:53,140
whether it was leaked

446
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,140
and you

447
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:56,140
didn't agree.

448
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:00,140
Now I finally understand

449
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:02,140
that Chief Wu Tian

450
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:04,140
doesn't want everyone to know

451
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:05,140
that this code has been leaked

452
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:06,140
and continues to get

453
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:08,140
your unwise interests.

454
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:09,140
So I have a reason to suspect

455
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:10,140
that you, Chief Wu Tian,

456
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:13,140
are the one who leaked the code.

457
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:15,140
You're lying!

458
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:19,140
I'm a soldier of the Japanese Empire.

459
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:21,140
I can't leak the code

460
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:22,140
if I fight with the Japanese.

461
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:23,140
Really?

462
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:24,140
But last time,

463
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:25,140
Charlie told me that

464
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:26,140
Miyamoto couldn't land on time

465
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:27,140
because of the temperature.

466
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:29,140
So you, Chief Wu Tian,

467
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:30,140
used your private relationship

468
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:31,140
with the Navy

469
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:32,140
to make a deal.

470
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:33,140
If you are so close

471
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:35,140
with the Navy,

472
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,140
it's hard to guarantee

473
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:37,140
that my code

474
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:38,140
wasn't leaked from you

475
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:40,140
to the Navy.

476
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:42,140
So I'm asking

477
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:43,140
who is the one

478
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:44,140
who is so determined

479
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:46,140
to be the biggest

480
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:47,140
cause of trouble

481
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:49,140
for Chief Wu Tian

482
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:50,140
who is so determined

483
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:51,140
to be the biggest

484
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:52,140
cause of trouble

485
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:57,140
Colonel,

486
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:59,140
I admit that I borrowed

487
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:01,140
the Navy's power.

488
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:03,140
I only borrowed the ship.

489
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:05,140
That's all I have this time.

490
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:06,140
This is a lie.

491
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:09,140
Because you escaped,

492
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:13,140
Kojiro was not there.

493
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:17,140
Whose power

494
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:20,140
did you borrow from the Navy?

495
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:38,140
If you want to get the most

496
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:40,140
profit from this case,

497
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:41,140
you have to be a Takeda.

498
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:43,140
You are like a secret body

499
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:45,140
of the Kumamoto family.

500
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:47,140
But the purpose of

501
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:48,140
your continuous actions

502
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:49,140
is to make a bargain

503
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:50,140
and be officially recognized

504
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:52,140
by the Kumamoto family.

505
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:53,140
Isn't that right?

506
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:01,140
Do you want to protect

507
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:02,140
the dignity of your family

508
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:04,140
with your secret body?

509
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:06,140
Do you think you have the right?

510
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:11,140
Colonel,

511
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:14,140
please listen to me one more time.

512
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:15,140
Please let me see

513
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:17,140
the truth of the matter.

514
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:20,140
Takeda,

515
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:24,140
do you remember what I said before?

516
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:27,140
What is the truth?

517
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:29,140
You can't leave a man

518
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:31,140
who has a secret

519
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:33,140
body.

520
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:43,140
Who is it?

521
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:48,140
Follow me.

522
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:52,140
Colonel,

523
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:53,140
Colonel,

524
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:54,140
Colonel,

525
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:56,140
why don't you believe

526
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:59,140
them and yourself?

527
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:03,140
I won't let them go.

528
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:05,140
I've already found the truth.

529
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:07,140
I'm sorry,

530
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:09,140
Colonel.

531
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:10,140
Colonel,

532
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:12,140
Takeda is not

533
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:15,140
representing the Navy.

534
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:19,140
I will punish him.

535
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:03,140
Takeda

536
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:24,140
Joseph,

537
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:26,140
I'm going to have a checkup in a few days.

538
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:28,140
I can't miss a single bite.

539
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:32,140
Takeda

540
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:43,140
So,

541
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:44,140
as long as we can handle

542
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:45,140
the checkup,

543
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:47,140
we can start

544
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:49,140
to target Wu Tian.

545
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:50,140
First,

546
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:52,140
let's test the left side.

547
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:53,140
Do you know

548
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:55,140
Wu Tian and the Navy?

549
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:59,140
You are not good to me.

550
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:01,140
You even want to

551
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:03,140
ask the Navy

552
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:05,140
to give me a pair of glasses.

553
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:07,140
Why didn't Zuo Zou Mu

554
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:08,140
show up?

555
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:10,140
Zuo Zou Mu didn't show up today,

556
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:11,140
but we should have

557
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:14,140
checked up on Wu Tian.

558
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:15,140
It's Wu Tian's

559
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:16,140
own action to

560
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:17,140
ask the Navy to show up.

561
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:18,140
Zuo Zou Mu should have

562
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:20,140
just applied.

563
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:22,140
Navy or not,

564
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:24,140
they are all Japanese.

565
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:25,140
Is there any problem

566
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:27,140
with Wu Tian asking the Navy?

567
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,140
The Navy and the Navy

568
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:30,140
are in a bad situation.

569
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:31,140
Zuo Zou Mu

570
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:32,140
will not use that record

571
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:34,140
to ask the Navy to show up.

572
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:36,140
Even if they show up,

573
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:38,140
Navy is the first suspect.

574
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:40,140
They won't suspect us.

575
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:52,140
Let's have a good talk.

576
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:54,140
Someone is taking pictures outside.

577
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:57,140
Normal people

578
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:58,140
like to use their eyes

579
00:29:58,140 --> 00:29:59,140
to sense the world.

580
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:00,140
So,

581
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:02,140
what they saw at first sight

582
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:04,140
must be the information on the map.

583
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:07,140
The code is locked up here.

584
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:08,140
If you don't touch it carefully,

585
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:10,140
you won't find it.

586
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:25,140
I'm hungry.

587
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:55,140
I'm hungry.

588
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:25,140
I'm hungry.

589
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:42,140
Li Jianna!

590
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:50,140
I got something for you.

591
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:51,140
Okay.

592
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:55,140
Let's go.

593
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:00,140
I don't know.

594
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:06,140
The winner's prize.

595
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:07,140
I'll drink it first.

596
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:08,140
Charlie.

597
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:13,140
Didn't you agree to write Miss?

598
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:15,140
Didn't you say no?

599
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:16,140
I agreed.

600
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:17,140
It's a donkey.

601
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:19,140
Not Ding Yi.

602
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:44,120
The

603
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:45,140
Oh, no.

604
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:49,140
I thought

605
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:50,140
the public doctor wouldn't come

606
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:51,140
after five days.

607
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:53,140
But I just got the news

608
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:54,140
that Miss Xia is here to cure your eyes.

609
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:03,140
Miss Xia,

610
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:04,140
let's have a talk.

611
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:12,140
I...

612
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:13,140
Let's go.

613
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:23,140
Once Gongwengyu

614
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:24,140
starts the treatment,

615
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:25,140
he'll report it.

616
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:27,140
But now it's too late.

617
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:28,140
Otherwise,

618
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:29,140
we'll try our best

619
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:31,140
to kill him without any proof.

620
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:32,140
No.

621
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:34,140
If we kill him

622
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:35,140
without any proof,

623
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:36,140
we can't tell

624
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:37,140
what kind of damage

625
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,140
Ding Yi's body will cause.

626
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:41,140
We can't use the police at that time.

627
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:43,140
I hope it's not too late.

628
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:45,860
How about this?

629
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:47,540
I'll go find Zuo Zuo.

630
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:49,740
I'll try to talk to him.

631
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:50,940
That won't do.

632
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:52,540
At this point,

633
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:54,540
you'll only let him doubt you if you go to him.

634
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:56,540
Don't rush.

635
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:57,540
Think about it.

636
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:12,140
I'll go find Zuo Zuo.

637
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:27,140
Dr. Miyamoto is waiting for you.

638
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:28,140
This way.

639
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:42,140
Dr. Miyamoto, please come in.

640
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:51,140
I'm here to give you a message.

641
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:52,140
This morning,

642
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:54,140
the Japanese went to see Dr. Shibata.

643
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:56,140
They said they were going to meet Mr. Miyamoto

644
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:58,140
with the Japanese doctor who came from Miyamoto.

645
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:02,140
Fortunately, Dr. Shibata didn't come to the clinic this morning.

646
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:03,140
I said I'd come in his place.

647
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:05,140
I can cover for you.

648
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:06,140
I'll go and check on him.

649
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:07,140
Okay.

650
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:08,140
Thank you.

651
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:09,140
Thank you.

652
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:10,140
I can cover for you.

653
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:12,140
Thank you, Mengjie.

654
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:14,140
I just got the news that

655
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:15,140
Miyamoto is in the hospital.

656
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:17,140
He's going to be treated.

657
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:18,140
We were discussing

658
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:19,140
whether we should use your method

659
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:21,140
to give him polmin.

660
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:23,140
But we don't know the medicine.

661
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:24,140
We don't know how much to give him.

662
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:25,140
It's great that you came.

663
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:31,140
If he decides to take a lot of polmin,

664
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:33,140
he needs to overcome the side effects of

665
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:35,140
fatigue, insomnia and drowsiness.

666
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:37,140
He has to come back within two hours.

667
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:38,140
Don't wash his stomach.

668
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:39,140
Otherwise,

669
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:41,140
his eyes will be permanently damaged

670
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,140
and he'll be in danger of life.

671
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:47,140
He can only see the doctor by himself.

672
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:49,140
He doesn't need to queue up or hang up.

673
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:50,140
Two hours should be enough.

674
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:52,140
It's not that simple.

675
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:54,140
After taking the medicine,

676
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:55,140
he will be easily sleepy

677
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:57,140
and fall into a coma.

678
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:01,140
What if he really falls asleep?

679
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:03,140
What will happen?

680
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:06,140
They will find the drug reaction on him.

681
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:07,140
If he does what he did before,

682
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:10,140
he will be dead.

683
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:18,140
I've finished my food.

684
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:19,140
It's not that difficult.

685
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:28,140
Ding Yi.

686
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:29,140
Ding Yi.

687
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:35,140
What's wrong?

688
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:37,140
Are you still dizzy?

689
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:39,140
Youyou.

690
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:41,140
Youyou.

691
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:49,140
It's still a bit difficult.

692
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:55,140
Are you still dizzy?

693
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:56,140
What are you talking about?

694
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:58,140
Hurry up and smoke.

695
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:00,140
Are you a fool?

696
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:04,140
Let me see.

697
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:06,140
Let me see.

698
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:08,140
What is this?

699
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:14,140
Is there any ice cube?

700
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:15,140
Can we find the ice cube?

701
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:17,140
It's too late. Let's do it again.

702
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:36,140
Captain Lin.

703
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:38,140
Mr. Li has made a mistake.

704
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:51,140
Excuse me.

705
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:52,140
I want to smoke.

706
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:54,140
Yes.

707
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:04,140
What's the situation outside?

708
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:06,140
Captain Sasaki ordered us to

709
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:08,140
always keep a close watch on you.

710
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:10,140
That's how much the Great Japanese Empire

711
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:13,140
values your body.

712
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:15,140
I understand.

713
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:18,140
We will leave the matter of the attack to the head of the party.

714
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:21,140
We will wait for you in the corridor.

715
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:23,140
Yes.

716
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:53,140
Please.

717
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:03,140
Would you like a cup of coffee?

718
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:04,140
Yes.

719
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:06,140
Please prepare a cup of coffee for him.

720
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:19,140
What's the result?

721
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:22,140
Dr. Miyamoto, would you like a cup of coffee?

722
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:24,140
Dr. Miyamoto wants to drink coffee.

723
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:27,140
Coffee?

724
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:37,140
Thank you.

725
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:52,140
The coffee in Shanghai is better than the coffee in Tokyo.

726
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:58,140
Are you sleepy?

727
00:39:58,140 --> 00:39:59,140
Mr. Li, are you sleepy?

728
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:07,140
Maybe it's because recently...

729
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:08,140
Recently?

730
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:10,140
Yes.

731
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:12,140
I'm sleepy.

732
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:14,140
I'm sleepy.

733
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:16,140
I'm sleepy.

734
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:19,140
It's because recently...

735
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:21,140
The work at the US Embassy is too busy.

736
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:24,140
Last night, there was a fire.

737
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:28,140
I'm tired.

738
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:33,140
You should take your time.

739
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:35,140
You should pay more attention to your work.

740
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:37,140
No matter how much you work, you can't break it.

741
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:42,140
Human health is a very important thing.

742
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:49,140
After a few dozen years,

743
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:53,140
Dr. Miyamoto has developed a new method of treatment for these diseases.

744
00:40:55,140 --> 00:41:00,140
Life is not always going well.

745
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:07,140
For example, I was really impressed by the experience of the company's company.

746
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:09,140
From the first day...

747
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:10,140
What about the first day?

748
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:12,140
Would you like a cup of coffee?

749
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,140
What are you doing?

750
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:21,140
One more cup.

751
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:24,140
Dr. Miyamoto said that the coffee in Shanghai is good.

752
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:25,140
He's a little tired.

753
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:27,140
He needs to be checked.

754
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:31,140
One more cup.

755
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:44,140
He stayed like this for three days.

756
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:46,140
What about the third day?

757
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:47,140
How many days are left?

758
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:52,140
Dr. Miyamoto, why don't we start the check-up first?

759
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:54,140
So that Mr. Li can go back to rest early.

760
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:56,140
Oh, right.

761
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:58,140
I forgot about this in the story.

762
00:41:58,140 --> 00:41:59,140
You forgot it.

763
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:15,140
Don't look at me.

764
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:17,140
Look down as much as possible.

765
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:46,140
The pressure of the blood pressure is high.

766
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:56,140
Dr. Miyamoto, this is a patient before the patient.

767
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:57,140
He's about to die.

768
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:16,140
The fire is always alone

769
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:18,140
The broken辣 is dragging the temperature

770
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:20,140
The red head through the eyes

771
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:22,140
Shake that weak one

772
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:24,140
The flower is blown up

773
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:26,140
The body of the army is turned into a maze

774
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:28,140
The flower is blown up

775
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:30,140
The body of the army is turned into a maze

776
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:32,140
The flower is blown up

777
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:34,140
The body of the army is turned into a maze

778
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:36,140
The flower is blown up

779
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:38,140
The body of the army is turned into a maze

780
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:40,140
The flower is blown up

781
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:42,140
The body of the army is turned into a maze

782
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:46,140
The first light will light up the way for me

783
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:50,140
When the day breaks

784
00:43:50,140 --> 00:43:54,140
The house is separated from the maze

785
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:58,140
No direction, no way out

786
00:43:58,140 --> 00:44:00,140
In the pain under the eyes

787
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:04,140
The fake Xi Zhen can't be said clearly

788
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:08,140
Where is the wind going?

789
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:10,140
Who's window is shaking?

790
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:12,140
The lock of the door

791
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:15,140
The heart is thinking

792
00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:19,140
Or you or me

793
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:22,140
He is watching

794
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:26,140
In the vast night

795
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:29,140
Tears are flowing

796
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:33,140
A group of wounded

797
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:36,140
He is watching

798
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:40,140
In the shadow

799
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:43,140
The night falls

800
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:48,140
Looking back at the world

801
00:45:02,140 --> 00:45:05,140
The house is separated from the maze

802
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:09,140
No direction, no way out

803
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:12,140
In the pain under the eyes

804
00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:16,140
The fake Xi Zhen can't be said clearly

805
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:19,140
Where is the wind going?

806
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:23,140
Who's window is shaking?

807
00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:26,140
The heart is thinking

808
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:30,140
Or you or me

809
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:33,140
He is watching

810
00:45:33,140 --> 00:45:36,140
In the vast night
