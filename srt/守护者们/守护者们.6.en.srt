57

He's always been a bad boy.

58
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:03,780
He's been watching our mountain and river.

59
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:07,780
That's why our young master is so hardworking.

60
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:17,780
Uncle Gu, how did he die?

61
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:22,780
Miss Bingqing died in the hands of the gods.

62
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:23,780
This is a suicide.

63
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:31,780
Uncle Gu, aren't you the leader of the shipyard?

64
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:35,780
How do you know so much about their Gu family?

65
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:38,780
I was the agent of Commander Gu.

66
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,780
I was in the North of China for 21 years.

67
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:43,780
I got injured.

68
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:47,780
I haven't fully recovered yet.

69
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,780
Later, Commander Gu pitied me.

70
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:52,780
I was so worried.

71
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:54,780
I was so worried.

72
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:56,780
Later, Commander Gu pitied me.

73
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,780
He had a job in the shipyard.

74
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:05,780
I shouldn't have been involved in your business.

75
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:08,780
I understand.

76
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:10,780
I understand.

77
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:13,780
I'll do everything under the supervision of the government.

78
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:15,780
That's good.

79
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:25,780
What happened?

80
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:44,780
What happened?

81
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:45,780
Why are you here for so long?

82
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:51,780
Uncle Gu, can you send me back to the Longevity Group?

83
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:55,780
Okay.

84
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:12,780
Don't pretend to me.

85
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:17,780
The landlord told me that a handsome young man bought you land.

86
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:21,780
It was just the day before my performance.

87
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:25,780
Tell me, why did you do that?

88
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:32,780
Because I'm not the handsome young man's assistant.

89
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:34,780
You bought it?

90
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:38,780
Where did you get the money from?

91
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:40,780
Look at the price.

92
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,780
It's the same as before.

93
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:45,780
I thought the market was so bad.

94
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:47,780
Let me see.

95
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:48,780
Let me see.

96
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:49,780
Don't be so noisy.

97
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:50,780
Go away.

98
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:51,780
Don't be too noisy.

99
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:55,780
You're just pretending to be old.

100
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:56,780
I'm so rich.

101
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:58,780
I'm afraid I'll steal your money.

102
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:02,780
You even broke your head to hug a man.

103
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:04,780
It's not clean.

104
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:07,780
I think it's your brain that's not clean.

105
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:08,780
You have no shame.

106
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:12,780
You're so mean to scold people.

107
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:14,780
You bitch.

108
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,780
Say it again.

109
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:21,780
I tell you, Xian Biyun.

110
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,780
You think you can drive me away like this.

111
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:27,780
There is more than one theater in Shanghai.

112
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:29,780
I'll make it clear today.

113
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:33,780
Our two people are a good match.

114
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:36,780
Stop.

115
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:37,780
Stop.

116
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:46,780
Remember to tell me where you found the money.

117
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:51,780
I'll send you the bill of the things you dropped.

118
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:53,780
Wait and see.

119
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:08,780
You go in first.

120
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:11,780
I'll wait for you here.

121
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:37,780
You bitch.

122
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:50,780
You bitch.

123
00:06:58,780 --> 00:06:59,780
Why are you back?

124
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:00,780
Did anyone see you outside?

125
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:01,780
No.

126
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:02,780
I should.

127
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:04,780
Why are you back all of a sudden?

128
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:05,780
Why are you back all of a sudden?

129
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:24,780
Wu Tian invited me to go to the

130
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:25,780
I'm not that scared.

131
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:28,780
Come here.

132
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:33,780
Sit.

133
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:34,780
I...

134
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:35,780
Sit anywhere.

135
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:41,780
Take off your glasses.

136
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:47,780
Did Gu Yanshan force you?

137
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:49,780
No, she didn't force me.

138
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:51,780
Okay.

139
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:52,780
Tell me the truth.

140
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:53,780
Tell me the truth.

141
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:55,780
What's your plan?

142
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:58,780
Miss Xin, I really can't tell you.

143
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:00,780
Last time, because of me,

144
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,780
the Japanese who messed up our troupe came.

145
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:05,780
This time, I can't get you involved again.

146
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:06,780
The situation is so tense now.

147
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,780
How can I help you if you don't tell me?

148
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:12,780
It's like this.

149
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:14,780
Gu Yanshan asked me to tell Wu Tian

150
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:16,780
that the password of the theater has been leaked.

151
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:17,780
If Wu Tian doesn't believe it,

152
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:20,780
let me persuade him to send a fake air-conditioning telegram.

153
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:22,780
Gu Yanshan will try to get the corresponding troops

154
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:24,780
to hang up the air-contact alarm.

155
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,780
As long as the alarm goes off,

156
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:29,780
Wu Tian will believe that the password of the theater has been leaked.

157
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:31,780
Then the Japanese can use this password.

158
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:34,780
It's such a risky plan.

159
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:38,780
You're easy to expose in front of Wu Tian.

160
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:41,780
So I want to ask Miss Xin to help me.

161
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:44,780
Let Long'er help me get a life-saving suit.

162
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:47,780
I remember when I first started acting for the theater,

163
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:52,780
there was a time when Wu Tian's class leader wanted to visit him.

164
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:55,780
Left foot, right foot.

165
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:57,780
Right foot, left foot.

166
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:59,780
Isn't that just a piece of cake?

167
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:04,780
Oh, right.

168
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:06,780
When the Japanese come back,

169
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:09,780
I'll give them a cup of tea.

170
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:10,780
Or a cup of tea.

171
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:12,780
I'll give them a cup of tea.

172
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:15,780
Do you want to drink tea or eat some fruit?

173
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:17,780
I can't see anything.

174
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:20,780
You don't have to do anything.

175
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:23,780
You just need to put this photo

176
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:26,780
in the most obvious position in the living room.

177
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:34,780
Oh my god.

178
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:36,780
This is exactly the same as when I was a kid.

179
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:39,780
Who is the person in the photo?

180
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,780
I don't know.

181
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:44,780
And Wu Tian didn't come that day.

182
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:46,780
But I remember very clearly.

183
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:48,780
Mr. Liu told me that

184
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:50,780
as long as this photo is there,

185
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:52,780
the Japanese will not dare to touch it.

186
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:05,780
This is not a joke.

187
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:10,780
Just a Long'er is not enough.

188
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:14,780
Come on.

189
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:28,780
Are you here to find Cao Yuan Zhou?

190
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:30,780
I'm here to find you.

191
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:38,780
Bi Yun.

192
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:40,780
You mean,

193
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:43,780
you want Long'er to take part in this operation tonight?

194
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:45,780
I want to ask Long'er for help.

195
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:48,780
I want to put a photo in the cabinet of the Japanese.

196
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:50,780
I want to say that at the critical moment,

197
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:52,780
we can save our lives.

198
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:55,780
But if we do this,

199
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,780
will it make Long'er too involved?

200
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:01,780
Long'er and Zhao Fu are very active.

201
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:03,780
They should get the chance to exercise

202
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:05,780
like Hong Yu.

203
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:08,780
After this,

204
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:10,780
we can apply to the Party.

205
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:14,780
But

206
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:16,780
these are not the key.

207
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:20,780
We can't contact Cao Yuan Zhou.

208
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,780
We were all fooled by him.

209
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:25,780
He didn't want to take action from the beginning.

210
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:27,780
But I don't have the authority of Shanghai Station.

211
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:29,780
So I can't use the Shanghai Station's radio station.

212
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:31,780
Since you already know,

213
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,780
what are you going to do next?

214
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:36,780
This is the reason I came to you.

215
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:40,780
Lu Han, I know you have a radio station

216
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:42,780
that you can connect with Chongqing Secret.

217
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:44,780
So as long as we use your radio station

218
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:46,780
and the Shanghai Station's password,

219
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:48,780
we can contact the Commander Wu Ying.

220
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:50,780
This will work.

221
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:52,780
You want the fake army to take over the mountain.

222
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:54,780
Once it's exposed, we'll both be dead.

223
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,780
Lu Han, success or failure is up to you.

224
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:00,780
Don't you understand?

225
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:02,780
Why Cao Yuan Zhou is unwilling to cooperate with you

226
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:04,780
is because your plan is too risky

227
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:06,780
and you're not sure.

228
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:10,780
As the leader,

229
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:12,780
we can't just sit around and wait.

230
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:14,780
Then why?

231
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:16,780
What can we rely on?

232
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:18,780
Should we rely on the Japanese to surrender?

233
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,780
The situation is not good now.

234
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:22,780
The soldiers are not good. The people are not good either.

235
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:24,780
You...

236
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:26,780
Why are you so disobedient?

237
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,780
Don't be too idealistic.

238
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:30,780
You can't drag others to the soil with you.

239
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:32,780
You can't drag others to kill the people.

240
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:34,780
You and I know what Jun Tong is up to.

241
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:36,780
Their internal strategy is wrong.

242
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:38,780
It's very inefficient.

243
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:40,780
Gu Yang Shan just came back

244
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:42,780
and is full of blood.

245
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:44,780
He doesn't know what's going on.

246
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:46,780
I'm worried

247
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:48,780
that he can't

248
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:50,780
really send the 405 battalion

249
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:52,780
to send a message.

250
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:54,780
But this is within a short time

251
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:56,780
to let the US military take the initiative

252
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:58,780
to take away the Japanese's password.

253
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:00,780
This is the only chance.

254
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,780
Since Jun Tong has made this decision,

255
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:04,780
they have to act now.

256
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:06,780
So we should help this blind man.

257
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:10,780
Do you know why he doesn't want to cooperate?

258
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:12,780
He's selfish.

259
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:14,780
He's protecting himself for the sake of the people.

260
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:16,780
He's fighting for the country because he's full of blood.

261
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:18,780
He's not cold-blooded and heartless.

262
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:20,780
You can be indifferent,

263
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:22,780
but I have to do something.

264
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:24,780
For the sake of the party, for the sake of the country,

265
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:26,780
I can sacrifice.

266
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:28,780
But I have to sacrifice on the battlefield.

267
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:30,780
I won't die with that little bastard.

268
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:32,780
The front line is the battlefield. The password is also the battlefield.

269
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:34,780
And the little bastard you're talking about

270
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:36,780
is fighting for our mission now.

271
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:38,780
He's fighting for the country.

272
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:42,780
Is Jun Tong going to fight

273
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,780
and be a coward?

274
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:48,780
I went back to him this morning.

275
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:50,780
He cried and told me

276
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:52,780
that he missed his mother.

277
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:56,780
I can't comfort him.

278
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:58,780
I have to be cruel

279
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:00,780
and let him help us change the password.

280
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:02,780
I joined Jun Tong for the sake of the country,

281
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:04,780
for the sake of the people.

282
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:06,780
He is

283
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:08,780
the people.

284
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:10,780
He's the one who's in charge of the front line.

285
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:12,780
Who the hell are we for?

286
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:14,780
Why do you believe this little bastard so much?

287
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:18,780
As a professional agent,

288
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:20,780
it's not necessarily a mission that can be accomplished.

289
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:24,780
Do you really believe this Ding Yi can convince Wu Tian?

290
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:28,780
I don't believe it.

291
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:32,780
I really do believe

292
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:34,780
that he's a big fish in the water.

293
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:38,780
But since I saw him

294
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:40,780
die twice because of our actions,

295
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:42,780
Lu Han,

296
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:44,780
he's in the same position in my heart

297
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:46,780
as you are.

298
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:48,780
He's my comrade in arms.

299
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:50,780
If we don't believe in our comrade in arms,

300
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:54,780
who else can we trust?

301
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:58,780
I don't have time.

302
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:00,780
No matter how hard you try to help me,

303
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:02,780
I have to protect Ding Yi.

304
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:12,780
Wait.

305
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:22,780
There's one last way.

306
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:24,780
What's that?

307
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:26,780
The military is probably unreliable.

308
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:28,780
We might as well apply to the party.

309
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:30,780
If Ding Yi and Gu Yangshan

310
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:32,780
really convince Wu Tian to send a secret message tonight,

311
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:34,780
then the party can contact the base nearby

312
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:36,780
and hang up the air alert

313
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:38,780
and cooperate with their actions.

314
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:40,780
Okay.

315
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:42,780
Do it this way.

316
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:44,780
Be more stable.

317
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,780
How about this?

318
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:50,780
I'll go with you.

319
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:52,780
How about this?

320
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:54,780
We'll split up.

321
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:56,780
You'll inform Xiao.

322
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:58,780
I'll handle this.

323
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:00,780
Okay.

324
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:06,780
From now on,

325
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:08,780
you are the servant of the party.

326
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:14,780
Then use the key that Ding Yi gave you

327
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:16,780
to enter the room 424 Li Yue Se.

328
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:22,780
Okay.

329
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:28,780
According to the plan,

330
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,780
Wu Tian should arrive at 6 o'clock.

331
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:32,780
You know how to get on the road.

332
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:34,780
You know how to get on the road.

333
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:36,780
So, in order to help Luo Er

334
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:38,780
get the photo and get the time,

335
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:40,780
we have to set up a barrier

336
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:42,780
for Wu Tian on the road.

337
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:44,780
Master, what's going on?

338
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:46,780
But with the photo,

339
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:48,780
we can't stop Wu Tian for a long time.

340
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:50,780
We can't stop him.

341
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:52,780
We have to help Luo Er get half an hour.

342
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:54,780
Master, what's going on?

343
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:56,780
Master, what's going on?

344
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:58,780
What are you doing?

345
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:00,780
Master, what's going on?

346
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:02,780
So, you have to act fast.

347
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:04,780
There can't be any accident.

348
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:16,780
Ding Yi, you're a big man.

349
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:20,780
How can you just leave the road?

350
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:22,780
You just tell me what to do.

351
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:24,780
Okay.

352
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:26,780
Okay.

353
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,780
Okay.

354
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:30,780
Okay.

355
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:32,780
Okay.

356
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:34,780
Okay.

357
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:36,780
Okay.

358
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:38,780
Okay.

359
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:40,780
Okay.

360
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:42,780
Okay.

361
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:44,780
Okay.

362
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:46,780
Okay.

363
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:49,780
Send the photos to your hand in the basement of the room.

364
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:51,780
I'll be right there.

365
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:59,780
33th class, do you need anything else?

366
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:07,780
Please bless me, Miss Sun.

367
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:09,780
Little photo.

368
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:18,780
From the beginning.

369
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:20,780
From the beginning.

370
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:22,780
From the beginning.

371
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:48,780
From the beginning.

372
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:14,780
Long'er, if there's a Japanese guard,

373
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:16,780
don't go in there.

374
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,780
They might be searching for you.

375
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:43,780
Mr. Li.

376
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:45,780
Mr. Li.

377
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:49,780
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.

378
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:51,780
I'll fill in the form.

379
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,780
You're finally here.

380
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:57,780
Please go.

381
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:03,780
You can hide the photos in the bathroom first.

382
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:06,780
Then find a chance to pour wine for Ding Yi.

383
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:10,780
Use our special red wine label to tell Ding Yi the specific location.

384
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:18,780
Ding Yi, the specific location of the photos

385
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:21,780
is written on the back of the red wine label.

386
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:37,780
Ni Hao, you...

387
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:47,780
Mr. Li, where's Charlie?

388
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:49,780
He's gone to help me with something.

389
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:55,780
What happened today...

390
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:57,780
I'm sorry.

391
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:01,780
I'm representing the US government to apologize to you.

392
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:06,780
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.

393
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:09,780
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.

394
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:12,780
I'm representing the US government to apologize to you.

395
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:15,780
What else do you want?

396
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:18,780
I'll go and get you some food.

397
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:21,780
This is the restaurant's specialty.

398
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,780
Please have a taste.

399
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:26,780
Wu Tian Sang, you're really thoughtful.

400
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:31,780
To be honest, I've always been proud.

401
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:35,780
I've never dealt with anyone other than the math department.

402
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:38,780
Even if I'm from the math department,

403
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:43,780
I wouldn't care if I didn't have my own skills.

404
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:49,780
But Wu Tian Sang, you're different.

405
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:56,780
You're the first real friend I've ever made

406
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:58,780
since I returned to China.

407
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:01,780
You've not only put in a lot of effort

408
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:04,780
to contact the Japanese doctor to treat my eyes.

409
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:06,780
But more importantly,

410
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:11,780
I've felt a sense of respect for the math department.

411
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:18,780
Thank you.

412
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:22,780
Bring the sake.

413
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:24,780
Yes.

414
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:37,780
Here.

415
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:39,780
Wait.

416
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:42,780
You're a good drinker.

417
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:44,780
This is for you.

418
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:47,780
I...

419
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:50,780
I like this.

420
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:53,780
Wu Tian likes to drink sake.

421
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:57,780
Thank you.

422
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:00,780
Mr. Li likes to drink red wine.

423
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:03,780
Wait!

424
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:10,780
Go away.

425
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:13,780
What a fool.

426
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:21,780
Excuse me.

427
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:32,780
Here.

428
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:45,780
I'll do it myself.

429
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:48,780
You pour it for the guest first.

430
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:02,780
Thank you.

431
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:20,780
Tai-Jun.

432
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:25,780
Tai-Jun, I won't let this fool appear in front of you again.

433
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:27,780
Go back!

434
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:30,780
Excuse me.

435
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:37,780
Mr. Li.

436
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:40,780
The US government has prepared a gift for you.

437
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:42,780
Be careful.

438
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:44,780
Don't be too careful.

439
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:47,780
Wu Tian.

440
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:49,780
There's a Chinese saying.

441
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:52,780
If you're a brother,

442
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:53,780
why...

443
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:55,780
Why should you be so close?

444
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:57,780
Exactly.

445
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:00,780
Wu Tian.

446
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:03,780
Now we're brothers.

447
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,780
Brother.

448
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:07,780
Before we became brothers,

449
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:09,780
we didn't talk about money.

450
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:11,780
We only talked about love.

451
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:13,780
Here.

452
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:15,780
The first drink of today.

453
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:18,780
To our friendship.

454
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:22,780
Okay.

455
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:24,780
Cheers.

456
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:27,780
Cheers.

457
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:36,780
Before we became brothers,

458
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:38,780
we didn't talk about money.

459
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:44,780
Now we're just friends.

460
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:57,780
Hurry up.

461
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:59,780
Hurry up.

462
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:06,780
Let's sit down.

463
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:08,780
Sit down.

464
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:13,780
Thank you for the warning.

465
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:20,780
Have I seen you before?

466
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:28,780
Mr. Li.

467
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:30,780
Please.

468
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:37,780
You're Ding Yi's driver?

469
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:41,780
Li Yue Se.

470
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:43,780
You're Li Yue Se's driver?

471
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:45,780
I'm here to help Ding Yi.

472
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:48,780
He didn't tell me that there were outsiders this time.

473
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:51,780
It seems that there are a lot of people this time.

474
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:53,780
I don't have time to talk.

475
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:55,780
I don't have time to wash my hands.

476
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,780
You can trust me.

477
00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:00,780
Do you want me to help you deliver things?

478
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:03,780
I wrote on the side of the red wine label.

479
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:05,780
The ink of the writing is special.

480
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:07,780
It will only show for three minutes.

481
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:09,780
After three minutes, even if Wu Tian tears off the label,

482
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:11,780
he won't find anything.

483
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:15,780
I gave the medicine to Ding Yi's photo.

484
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:19,780
It was under the painting of the female washroom.

485
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:21,780
Mr. Li.

486
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:23,780
The two beautiful ladies in the photo

487
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:25,780
are my friends from Japan.

488
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:28,780
And the one on your left

489
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:31,780
is the famous actress in Shanghai,

490
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:33,780
Miss Xiao Chunlan.

491
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:37,780
Mr. Li Yue Se

492
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:39,780
is my partner.

493
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:43,780
No.

494
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:45,780
Now he is my brother.

495
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:49,780
It's you.

496
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:51,780
You hit me this afternoon.

497
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:59,780
You know each other?

498
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:00,780
Yes.

499
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:01,780
We met this afternoon.

500
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:03,780
We were in the Chaosheng Group.

501
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:05,780
Right?

502
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:09,780
I'm sorry, Miss.

503
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:11,780
I...

504
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:13,780
I can't see.

505
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:16,780
I'm sorry.

506
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:18,780
Your shirt.

507
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:21,780
What did you do in the Chaosheng Group?

508
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:28,780
I did some private affairs.

509
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:30,780
Private affairs?

510
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:38,780
I didn't expect

511
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:40,780
that Mr. Li had other connections

512
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:43,780
besides the blood donation.

513
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:47,780
I just

514
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:49,780
found someone.

515
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:52,780
So,

516
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:54,780
what did you do

517
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:56,780
to Mr. Li?

518
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:58,780
What can the Chaosheng Group have

519
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:00,780
except that Xian Biyun?

520
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:04,780
Mr. Li.

521
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:07,780
You didn't go to find Xian Biyun, did you?

522
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:11,780
You didn't even let go of a blind man.

523
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:13,780
He's not picky.

524
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:19,780
Mr. Li.

525
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:21,780
Do you know Miss Xian?

526
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:25,780
How did you know each other?

527
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:27,780
Yes, Mr. Li.

528
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:29,780
Tell us.

529
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:36,780
Secret.

530
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:38,780
I hate men who talk

531
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:40,780
and talk half-heartedly.

532
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:42,780
They are so obvious.

533
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:44,780
They are so obvious.

534
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:46,780
You're right.

535
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:48,780
Miss Xian

536
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:51,780
was a famous star in Shanghai.

537
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:53,780
But now...

538
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:57,780
Mr. Li.

539
00:29:57,780 --> 00:30:00,780
I'm so curious about Mr. Wu Tian.

540
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:02,780
Tell us.

541
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:09,780
Miss Xian is a

542
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:12,780
beautiful woman.

543
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:15,780
I've heard

544
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:18,780
that she's a very beautiful woman.

545
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:26,780
That's right.

546
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:29,780
Because she can marry

547
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:31,780
the woman who is the perfume of Ye Ba Li.

548
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:35,780
When I met her,

549
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:38,780
for the first time in my life,

550
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:40,780
I felt sorry

551
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:42,780
for my poor ability.

552
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:46,780
Miss Xian.

553
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:52,780
You're not even

554
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:54,780
as rich as Mr. Ma.

555
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:57,780
You'll be dead

556
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:59,780
if you do it again.

557
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:02,780
Go.

558
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:04,780
Yes.

559
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:11,780
The first time

560
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:13,780
I met Miss Xian

561
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:15,780
was at the door of Chaosheng Group.

562
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:19,780
That night,

563
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:22,780
it was raining.

564
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:25,780
I accidentally

565
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:28,780
slipped.

566
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:33,780
I didn't expect

567
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:35,780
that Mr. Li

568
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:38,780
had such a relationship with Miss Xian.

569
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:40,780
I'm ashamed.

570
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:42,780
So that night,

571
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:45,780
you went to Chaosheng Group

572
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:48,780
to meet Miss Xian, right?

573
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:51,780
That day?

574
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:54,780
I remember.

575
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:59,780
After I broke up with Mr. Wu,

576
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:02,780
I went to the Weiling Museum.

577
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:05,780
I passed by Chaosheng Group on the way.

578
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:09,780
No.

579
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:11,780
Mr. Wu.

580
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:12,780
How did you know?

581
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:14,780
Are you

582
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:17,780
following me?

583
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:30,780
Mr. Li.

584
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:31,780
Yes.

585
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:34,780
Mr. Li.

586
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:37,780
Tonight,

587
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:38,780
I'll give you

588
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:41,780
a big surprise.

589
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:44,780
Thank you.

590
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:45,780
My pleasure, madam.

591
00:32:54,780 --> 00:33:07,140
Zhang Li's

592
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:14,780
Please sit.

593
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:18,780
Is Miss Xian here?

594
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:27,780
Mr. Li.

595
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:29,780
I just told you

596
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:31,780
a big surprise.

597
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:36,780
Mr. Li likes Miss Xian.

598
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:39,780
As a brother,

599
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:41,780
I invited Miss Xian

600
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:42,780
to come here.

601
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:45,780
I wonder if Mr. Li

602
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:48,780
thinks I'm a bad guy.

603
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:50,780
If I say yes,

604
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:53,780
can you

605
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:55,780
invite Miss Xian back?

606
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:03,780
I'm just kidding.

607
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:07,780
I'm kidding.

608
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:14,780
You were behind me just now.

609
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:16,780
What did you talk about?

610
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:19,780
I just heard about your romance.

611
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:23,780
It's just my own romance.

612
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:26,780
My own feelings

613
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:29,780
have nothing to do with Miss Xian.

614
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:35,780
But I'm very kind.

615
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:38,780
I don't know what Miss Xian

616
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:39,780
said to Mr. Li.

617
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:41,780
Your personal feelings

618
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:44,780
have nothing to do with Miss Xian?

619
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:13,780
I saw her fall at the gate of my company.

620
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:15,780
I saved her.

621
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:19,780
And then?

622
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:42,780
I just remember

623
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:45,780
the first thing Miss Xian said was

624
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:48,780
You're blind.

625
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:54,780
It seems

626
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:57,780
this romance

627
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:59,780
is not a good thing.

628
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:01,780
It's just a bad thing.

629
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:03,780
I'm just kidding.

630
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:05,780
I'm just kidding.

631
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:07,780
I'm just kidding.

632
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:09,780
I'm just kidding.

633
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:10,780
This romance

634
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:12,780
is not Mr. Li's.

635
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:16,780
It's yours.

636
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:28,780
Actually, I hate

637
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:30,780
hearing the word

638
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:32,780
blind.

639
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:34,780
But I don't know why.

640
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:37,780
I just felt the kindness

641
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:40,780
and no discrimination.

642
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:42,780
I still remember

643
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:44,780
that night,

644
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:46,780
Miss Xian covered for me

645
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:48,780
and invited me to her car.

646
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:51,780
She even sent me back to the hotel.

647
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:55,780
All the way,

648
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:57,780
Miss Xian

649
00:36:58,780 --> 00:36:59,780
smelled like

650
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:00,780
the night Paris.

651
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:03,780
It made me feel

652
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:05,780
that I was really

653
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:07,780
in Paris.

654
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:12,780
Good.

655
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:13,780
Good.

656
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:14,780
Good.

657
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:16,780
Mr. Li,

658
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:18,780
our second cup

659
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:20,780
is for

660
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,780
your love.

661
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:23,780
Let's go.

662
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:37,780
May I have a drink?

663
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:41,780
I'll have a drink.

664
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:54,780
Mr. Li, you have a good memory.

665
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:57,780
What?

666
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:00,780
I'm not going to dance.

667
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:01,780
I want to drink.

668
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:03,780
You don't want to drink?

669
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:04,780
I'm going to drink.

670
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:05,780
I'm going to drink.

671
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:23,780
I'm going to drink.

672
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:53,780
Excuse me.

673
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:23,780
I'm going to drink.

674
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:24,780
I'm going to drink.

675
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:25,780
I'm going to drink.

676
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:26,780
I'm going to drink.

677
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:27,780
I'm going to drink.

678
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:28,780
I'm going to drink.

679
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:29,780
I'm going to drink.

680
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:30,780
I'm going to drink.

681
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:31,780
I'm going to drink.

682
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:32,780
I'm going to drink.

683
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:33,780
I'm going to drink.

684
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:34,780
I'm going to drink.

685
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:35,780
I'm going to drink.

686
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:36,780
I'm going to drink.

687
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:37,780
I'm going to drink.

688
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:38,780
I'm going to drink.

689
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:39,780
I'm going to drink.

690
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:40,780
I'm going to drink.

691
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:41,780
I'm going to drink.

692
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:42,780
I'm going to drink.

693
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:43,780
I'm going to drink.

694
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:44,780
I'm going to drink.

695
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:45,780
I'm going to drink.

696
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:46,780
I'm going to drink.

697
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:47,780
I'm going to drink.

698
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:48,780
I'm going to drink.

699
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:49,780
I'm going to drink.

700
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:54,780
Gu Yangshan, the 405 will respond and will hang up the air alert on time.

701
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:56,780
But if you and Ding Yi fail,

702
00:39:56,780 --> 00:40:01,780
the consequences of us using the Shanghai Station code to fake the alarm will be hard to bear.

703
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:04,780
We will definitely succeed.

704
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:07,780
I promise you at eight o'clock.

705
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:11,780
I promise you that the air alert will hang up.

706
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:20,780
The air alert will hang up.

707
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:21,780
The air alert will hang up.

708
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:22,780
The air alert will hang up.

709
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:23,780
The air alert will hang up.

710
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:24,780
The air alert will hang up.

711
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:25,780
The air alert will hang up.

712
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:26,780
The air alert will hang up.

713
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:27,780
The air alert will hang up.

714
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:28,780
The air alert will hang up.

715
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:29,780
The air alert will hang up.

716
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:30,780
The air alert will hang up.

717
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:31,780
The air alert will hang up.

718
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:32,780
The air alert will hang up.

719
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:33,780
The air alert will hang up.

720
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:34,780
The air alert will hang up.

721
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:35,780
The air alert will hang up.

722
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:36,780
The air alert will hang up.

723
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:37,780
The air alert will hang up.

724
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:38,780
The air alert will hang up.

725
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:39,780
The air alert will hang up.

726
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:40,780
The air alert will hang up.

727
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:41,780
The air alert will hang up.

728
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:42,780
The air alert will hang up.

729
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:43,780
The air alert will hang up.

730
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:44,780
Miss Xian

731
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:46,780
knows a lot about the culture of Britain.

732
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:47,780
But unfortunately,

733
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:50,780
she hasn't been to Britain yet.

734
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:52,780
So I'm thinking

735
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:53,780
if I can spend the rest of my life

736
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:55,780
with her

737
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:57,780
in London,

738
00:40:57,780 --> 00:40:59,780
it will be a wonderful journey.

739
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:03,780
Mr. Li,

740
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:05,780
you must keep your word.

741
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:07,780
I will.

742
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:08,780
I will.

743
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:09,780
I will.

744
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:10,780
I will.

745
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:11,780
I will.

746
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:12,780
I will.

747
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:13,780
I will.

748
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:14,780
I will.

749
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:15,780
Come on.

750
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:18,780
To thank Mr. Li for his kindness,

751
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:20,780
let's have another drink.

752
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:22,780
Miss Xian,

753
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:24,780
cheers.

754
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:36,780
Boss.

755
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:38,780
Thank you.

756
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:41,780
What's wrong?

757
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:44,780
Captain Sasaki has returned.

758
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:46,780
An emergency meeting is being held.

759
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:48,780
He will be back soon.

760
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:50,780
I see.

761
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:55,780
Mr. Li,

762
00:41:56,780 --> 00:42:00,780
I need to take care of some work.

763
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:05,780
Let's stop for a drink today.

764
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:07,780
I will be there in time.

765
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:09,780
But when I'm there,

766
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:11,780
you can go to the main place.

767
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:13,780
Mr. Wu,

768
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:16,780
you invited me here today.

769
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:19,780
You have to leave now.

770
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:21,780
But my brother's wine

771
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:23,780
is not ready yet.

772
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:29,780
Miss Xian and Miss Chunlan are here.

773
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:31,780
Mr. Li,

774
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:33,780
cheers.

775
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:36,780
Keep her company.

776
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:38,780
Mr. Wu,

777
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:39,780
don't leave in a hurry.

778
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:40,780
Come on.

779
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:41,780
Let's have a drink.

780
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:44,780
Come on.

781
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:46,780
Captain Wu Tian,

782
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:47,780
Captain Lin.

783
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:50,780
Mr. Li,

784
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:52,780
the ship to Hong Kong

785
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:53,780
is ready tomorrow night.

786
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:55,780
Sorry,

787
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:56,780
there are too many people to buy the tickets.

788
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:57,780
I'm late.

789
00:42:57,780 --> 00:42:58,780
It's okay.

790
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:01,780
Mr. Li,

791
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:03,780
you're leaving?
