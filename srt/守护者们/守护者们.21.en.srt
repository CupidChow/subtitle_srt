1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You

2
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,080
Yeah

3
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,000
He studied in the Soviet Union

4
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,640
He has full-time work experience

5
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,880
He understands password

6
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,160
He is also old enough

7
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,760
The most important thing is

8
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,440
He is taking risks

9
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,280
to hide his stomach disease

10
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,120
All these signs are combined together

11
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,920
I suspect he might be Bai Ye

12
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,800
How long will it take for Bai Ye to believe in my trust?

13
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,800
I'm afraid it's too late

14
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,800
Wait two more days

15
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,040
During this period

16
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,240
We deploy first

17
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,600
Withdraw the plan

18
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,880
Be careful of the route

19
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,680
I will notify you as soon as possible

20
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:47,920
Ok

21
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Come in

22
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,800
Come in

23
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,400
Director Yang

24
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,400
You asked me so late

25
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,920
What can I do for you?

26
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:19,840
Sit

27
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,840
Director Yang

28
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,200
Well

29
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,520
I think Dong Jinbo and Liu Fangbai

30
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,960
are very capable

31
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,560
So I want to transfer them

32
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,680
to other places

33
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,040
to carry out a secret mission

34
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,640
Great

35
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,880
They are selected

36
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,320
That's their luck

37
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,920
I have a face of light

38
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,640
You can use them anytime

39
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,640
I will fully support your work

40
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,960
Thank you for your support

41
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:00,640
You two know about this

42
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,720
Don't let the third person know

43
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,120
You know our work experience

44
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,120
I understand

45
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,720
Don't worry

46
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,480
I will keep it a secret

47
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,080
Go back and rest

48
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,160
Ok

49
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,040
Director Yang, you should rest too

50
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,320
Goodbye

51
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,240
Come in

52
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,360
Did you call me?

53
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,560
Go ahead

54
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,080
Go

55
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,000
This is the token

56
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,840
the farmer left to us

57
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:53,640
The secret code of the nuclear power plant may have been broken.

58
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,640
It has shocked Director Dai.

59
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,640
Chongqing's order has reached the third station.

60
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:01,640
From today, all the companies will stop using the secret code of the nuclear power plant.

61
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:04,640
The power plant will be in operation for three days.

62
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:07,640
Shen Wenqing must be sent to the station within three days.
