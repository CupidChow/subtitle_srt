1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,920
Minecraft

2
00:01:30,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Please

3
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Oh

4
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,520
Bow

5
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,240
bury

6
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,820
He knows me better than I know you.

7
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,000
He said

8
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,960
we should leave Tianning Peak.

9
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:38,960
They say

10
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:55,260
there's noory

11
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:58,200
or no degree ofindustry.

12
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,200
I've said what I should have said.

13
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,200
We're investigating the scene.

14
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:11,200
Please wait here until the result is out.

15
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,200
Thank you.

16
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,200
It's okay.

17
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,200
The color of the moon is gone.

18
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,200
I'm sorry.

19
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,200
Oh, right.

20
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,200
When I was in the hospital,

21
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,200
I woke up suddenly.

22
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,200
Nobody expected that

23
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,200
my identity was exposed.

24
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,200
I didn't have a chance to discuss with you.

25
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,200
The only thought at that time was

26
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,200
to save you.

27
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,200
Maybe I was a little impulsive.

28
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,200
Don't be angry with me.

29
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,200
You just called me to shut up in the hospital.

30
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,200
I was a little angry.

31
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,200
But I let you shut up just now.

32
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,200
We're even.

33
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,200
And

34
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:06,200
we were holding the bomb together.

35
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:11,200
When we walked from there to the waterfront,

36
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,200
I said a bunch of bad words.

37
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:21,200
Because I thought I was going to die soon.

38
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,200
I was afraid that I wouldn't make it if I didn't say it.

39
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,200
So I...

40
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,200
You...

41
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,200
You just pretend you didn't hear anything.

42
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,200
I heard it.

43
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,200
Actually, when I was trapped in the hospital,

44
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,200
I was scared, too.

45
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,200
After you left,

46
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,200
I felt the hospital was safe.

47
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,200
I was afraid that

48
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,200
the hospital was quiet.

49
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,200
It was like a dream.

50
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:02,200
I was so angry that I kept listening.

51
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,200
I was hoping

52
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,200
I could hear the hand of the hand again.

53
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,200
Right?

54
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,200
Yes.

55
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,200
It's this voice.

56
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:55,200
I was the last person to hear this voice.

57
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,200
Because every time I heard this voice,

58
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,200
it meant that we had to disguise ourselves

59
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,200
to face danger.

60
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,200
But when I heard this voice

61
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:13,200
disappear further and further away,

62
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:16,200
it was the first time in my life that I was so scared.

63
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,200
I was afraid of losing it.

64
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,200
Ding Yi,

65
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,200
I'm not heartless.

66
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,200
I can feel it.

67
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,200
Actually, I always thought that I...

68
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,200
I'm not afraid of you.

69
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,200
I'm a very timid person.

70
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,200
You are a timid person.

71
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,200
But you are a timid person.

72
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,200
But you did so many great things.

73
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,200
Hurry up and change my password.

74
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,200
In case of writing a secret.

75
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,200
When I was young, I ate shrimp noodles.

76
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,200
I ordered a plate of shrimp.

77
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,200
I ate it.

78
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,200
I ordered a plate of shrimp.

79
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,200
After eating it, I was really full.

80
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,200
I am now the vice director of the password research team.

81
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,200
From now on, you don't have to beg anyone.

82
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,200
I'm here.

83
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,200
Is it just that the noodles are so simple?

84
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,200
What do you mean?

85
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,200
Li Yun.

86
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,200
Jiaxin.

87
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,200
Is it you?

88
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,200
It's me.

89
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,200
Smell it.

90
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,200
Come on.

91
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,200
Smell me.

92
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,200
Smell it now.

93
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,200
Come on.

94
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,200
Smell it.

95
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,200
Don't worry.

96
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,200
This is the first person in this family that I have officially entrusted to me.

97
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,200
I will definitely not let the family down.

98
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,200
Then the person named Zuo Zuo Mu must not be kept.

99
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,200
As long as it's Zuo Zuo Mu,

100
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,200
I won't let anyone get away with it.

101
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,200
Now I'm not leaving.

102
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,200
Please allow me to complete it for him.

103
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,200
I want to be Bai Yan.

104
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,200
Lao Gu, Hong Yu and Bai Yan.

105
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,200
They are not a waste of sacrifice.

106
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,200
I will be like them.

107
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,200
Throw away the heart and the liver.

108
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,200
Roll you to the disaster.

109
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,200
Roll you to the disaster.

110
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,200
Every time I see you, I think,

111
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,200
how could there be such a silly person?

112
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,200
He doesn't understand anything.

113
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,200
He doesn't know anything.

114
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,200
He has a lot of chances to leave,

115
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:10,200
but he has to stay and walk all the way to the dark.

116
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,200
When you left the hospital,

117
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,200
what you said

118
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,200
has proved that you are braver than anyone.

119
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,200
In the fate book,

120
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,200
we are in the same line.

121
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,200
I just wanted to prove

122
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,200
that I was a good man.

123
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,200
Actually, all this time,

124
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,200
I've been thinking about you.

125
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,200
Actually, all this time,

126
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,200
I've been thinking about you.

127
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,200
Just like Luo Ming,

128
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,200
I want to be like Zhu Li Yan.

129
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,200
I just want to be with you forever.

130
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,200
But at that time,

131
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,200
I was afraid that I would be a bad person.

132
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,200
I have seen enough of love.

133
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,200
I have seen enough of revolution.

134
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,200
Then I found that

135
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,200
you and Zhu Li Yan are not the same.

136
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,200
Love for you

137
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,200
may be just a light of life.

138
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,200
Even

139
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,200
it is a sweet talk.

140
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,200
Even without love,

141
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,200
you are still the bravest warrior.

142
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,200
So I have been trying

143
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,200
to be like you.

144
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,200
You did it.

145
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,200
Although we are not qualified to talk about love now,

146
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,200
we all have the right to admire love.

147
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:38,200
I will forever keep this ring.

148
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,200
Isn't it from Li Yue Si?

149
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,200
It is from Ding Yi.

150
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,200
The shape of this ring

151
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,200
is called Mo Bi Wu Si Huan.

152
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,200
It has only one curve

153
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,200
that can be looped.

154
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,200
No matter how many times you loop it,

155
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,200
it will always be the same.

156
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,200
It is the shape of a ring.

157
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,200
It is the shape of a ring.

158
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,200
It is the shape of a ring.

159
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,200
It is the shape of a ring.

160
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,200
No matter which direction we go,

161
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,200
they are all on the same path.

162
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,200
We will meet in the end.

163
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,200
In the book of explosives of ouraran,

164
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,200
each of us stands as the silliest among a group.

165
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,200
They let the longest stay behind each together.

166
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:56,200
Of course.

167
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:02,200
There are 400 million Chinese people

168
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:07,200
who are in the same line of work.

169
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:27,200
The Chinese government has been working

170
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:30,200
to make sure that the Chinese people

171
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:33,200
are not only in the same line of work,

172
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:37,200
but also in the same line of work.

173
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:40,200
The Chinese government has been working

174
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:43,200
to make sure that the Chinese people

175
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:46,200
are not only in the same line of work,

176
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:49,200
but also in the same line of work.

177
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,200
With more people than on the same level.

178
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:54,200
One share of the Chinese government

179
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:57,200
is having maybe less than 200,000 people

180
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:00,200
participating per month.

181
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:03,200
This indicates that once you Abt

182
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:07,200
contact the Chinese Government within the next year

183
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:10,200
China will start a strong movement

184
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:13,200
to fight for the same rights as you.

185
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,200
What on earthSE JOE 입O Ahhhh

186
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,200
之

187
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,020
Good.

188
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:30,320
Is the final conclusion confirmed?

189
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:35,780
Mr. Liang,

190
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:37,780
the accuracy

191
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,280
of your information

192
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,800
is really amazing.

193
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:45,860
Indeed.

194
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:46,860
You're a master.

195
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:50,860
Since it's Tong Mingzhuang,

196
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:52,860
it should be beautiful.

197
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:54,860
Don't make it difficult for Captain Cao.

198
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:00,860
I've given the signal,

199
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:01,860
and checked it.

200
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:03,860
You've been tossing and turning all night.

201
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:04,860
You should tell me

202
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:05,860
it's seven o'clock.

203
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:18,860
Send Mr. Liang aboard.

204
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:19,860
Wait.

205
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:24,860
What does it mean?

206
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:28,860
Mr. Liang,

207
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:32,860
don't blame me for being rude.

208
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:34,860
Blame yourself.

209
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,860
You're a big flour factory.

210
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:37,860
You have dozens of brothers.

211
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:39,860
You can't just leave it like that.

212
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:48,860
As a man,

213
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:50,860
you should leave a way for yourself.

214
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:03,860
If I don't leave a way for myself,

215
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:07,860
will I have the same day as Captain Cao's?

216
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:13,860
Whatever you say.

217
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:14,860
Anyway,

218
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:16,860
I'm just trying to

219
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:20,860
save the country from the danger.

220
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:22,860
Wujian,

221
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:25,860
if you say so,

222
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:27,860
I'll have to talk to you.

223
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:30,860
Captain,

224
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:32,860
what about the famous

225
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:34,860
Three-flowered Girl in your house?

226
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:42,860
I remember after Shanghai Station was bombed,

227
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:43,860
this painting appeared

228
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:45,860
in the house of the chairman of the Zhou family

229
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:47,860
in the north of Nanjing.

230
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:50,860
What a coincidence!

231
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:53,860
The one who sent you to the Zhou family

232
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,860
was Liang's old friend.

233
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:00,860
I've seen this painting.

234
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:02,860
The Three-flowered Girl

235
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:04,860
has a pair of beautiful eyes.

236
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:14,860
You two can leave first.

237
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,860
This painting has been lost for a long time.

238
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:31,860
Mr. Yang has news.

239
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:36,860
Captain Cao,

240
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,860
if I die with you today,

241
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:40,860
yes,

242
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:42,860
I can keep my mouth shut.

243
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:44,860
But I don't know

244
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:46,860
if my family can help you

245
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:49,860
keep this secret.

246
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:07,860
The Sasaki Unmanned Vehicle and the Federation

247
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:09,860
are ready to kill and destroy

248
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:11,860
the Toenji Empire.

249
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:15,860
The actions of the Hayashi Megumi last night

250
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:17,860
are also suspected of being

251
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,860
a part of the Imperial Army's internal control.

252
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:21,860
Currently, the Ministry of Defense

253
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:23,860
has been under military investigation,

254
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:26,860
and China's forces are being attacked.

255
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:30,860
Therefore,

256
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:32,860
the new government's secret operation

257
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:34,860
is not something

258
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:37,860
I can ask you to do.

259
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:42,860
This is the information

260
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:45,860
that Sasaki managed.

261
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:50,860
Please do as quickly as possible

262
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:53,860
to get the work done.

263
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:05,860
Well,

264
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:08,860
this list

265
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:11,860
is one of my ways.

266
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:12,860
The good things I have

267
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:14,860
are not only this.

268
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:17,860
I have a lot of people

269
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:18,860
in Hong Kong's warehouse

270
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:21,860
with a lot of gold and gold.

271
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:23,860
Only I know the location.

272
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:36,860
How dare you throw the warehouse to me?

273
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:39,860
As long as I get to Chongqing safely,

274
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:41,860
we will work together.

275
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,860
This credit is ours.

276
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:53,860
Such a big gift,

277
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:56,860
you just want two tickets?

278
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:58,860
Of course.

279
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:00,860
I need you, Commander Cao,

280
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:02,860
to give me a fake ID

281
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:04,860
to prove that I'm not a confident person.

282
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:08,860
You sent me to the Japanese-made secret organization.

283
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:26,860
Every comrade needs to blow up Shanghai Station

284
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:31,860
to get a core contact point.

285
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:37,860
Mr. Yang, I really want to help you.

286
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:42,860
But your story is not far-fetched.

287
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:45,860
Do you think it's not far-fetched

288
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:48,860
or does someone else think it's not far-fetched?

289
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:00,860
To give a message to comrades

290
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:02,860
is the meaning of the Dai Qu Party.

291
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:06,860
I dare not make a mistake.

292
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:13,860
What kind of explanation do you need?

293
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:29,860
Finally, all the obstacles have been cleared.

294
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:31,860
What's wrong?

295
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:34,860
There's one last thing.

296
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:49,860
Who is it?

297
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:50,860
It's me.

298
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:52,860
I'm here to see you.

299
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:54,860
I'm here to see you.

300
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,860
I'm here to see you.

301
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:58,860
I'm here to see you.

302
00:24:58,860 --> 00:24:59,860
Who is it?

303
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:00,860
It's me.

304
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:05,860
Liang, you're finally back.

305
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:07,860
These people at the door are so weird.

306
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:09,860
I'm so scared.

307
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:10,860
Close the door.

308
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:14,860
Have you got the ticket?

309
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:16,860
Yes.

310
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:18,860
Tomorrow afternoon.

311
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:21,860
Thank you, thank you.

312
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:24,860
Hurry up and pack up.

313
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,860
Take the medicine.

314
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:32,860
I'm ready.

315
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:35,860
I don't know if Chongqing's doctors are good.

316
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:37,860
I'm all prepared.

317
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:40,860
If it doesn't work, I'll sell it to them.

318
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:42,860
I'll use it to make up for it.

319
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:47,860
If only we could go to Hong Kong later.

320
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:49,860
Hong Kong is very close.

321
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:51,860
My family is over there.

322
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:53,860
I don't have to be afraid of anything.

323
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:57,860
People say that Hong Kong

324
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:59,860
is very warm all year round.

325
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:01,860
If you go to Hong Kong,

326
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,860
your leg will be much better.

327
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:06,860
What is it called?

328
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:07,860
The Great Wall of the Empress.

329
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:10,860
All the good things are in the Great Wall of the Empress.

330
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:13,860
Rich people live in Ban Shan.

331
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:15,860
Ban Shan is a place where

332
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:16,860
when the windows are open,

333
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:18,860
you can see Victoria Harbor.

334
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:22,860
It's so happy to think about it.

335
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:28,860
I'm sorry.

336
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:38,860
When I'm stable,

337
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:41,860
I'll be able to see you again.

338
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:44,860
In the past,

339
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:47,860
I used to say, wait, wait,

340
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:49,860
give me a better life.

341
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:52,860
Now I understand.

342
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:55,860
We're together.

343
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:56,860
We're safe and sound.

344
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:58,860
This is the best life.

345
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:00,860
Hong Kong, right?

346
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:19,860
It's been so many years.

347
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:23,860
My son will be here soon.

348
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:27,860
It's okay.

349
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:57,860
Hong Kong, right?

350
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:12,860
Oliang.

351
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:18,860
We've been counting on each other for half a lifetime.

352
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:21,860
This time,

353
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:25,860
you're counting on me too.

354
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:31,860
How did your hands get so dirty?

355
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:40,860
Oliang.

356
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:41,860
Oliang.

357
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:46,860
People

358
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:48,860
have a little fortune.

359
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:50,860
It's not

360
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:52,860
a big deal.

361
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:56,860
It's not a big deal.

362
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:02,860
It's not.

363
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:19,860
It's not.

364
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:51,860
They say there's no right or wrong.

365
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:53,860
Mr. Yang,

366
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:56,860
you're really a big shot.

367
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:03,860
Then what kind of

368
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:05,860
explanation do you need?

369
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:20,860
The person who helped you

370
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:21,860
in the war

371
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:22,860
is

372
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:26,860
Liang Lan.

373
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:36,860
Ye Ni

374
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:39,860
betrayed the people

375
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:43,860
and betrayed the people.

376
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:49,860
The land

377
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:52,860
is not strong enough

378
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:56,860
to fight in the war.

379
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:02,860
The fire army

380
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:05,860
lost ten lives

381
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:06,860
and died.

382
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:09,860
It's unforgivable.

383
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:10,860
Oliang.

384
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:17,860
Oliang's explanation

385
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:20,860
is satisfactory.

386
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:29,860
The situation in the Japanese army

387
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:33,860
is worse than the brothers in Shanghai.

388
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:36,860
Plus,

389
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:39,860
the gold in the warehouse in Hong Kong

390
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:44,860
is three times more than the gold in the warehouse in Shanghai.

391
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:47,860
Mr. Yang,

392
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:49,860
I

393
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:51,860
can give you the gold in the warehouse.

394
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:54,860
Thank you, Chief Cao.

395
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:00,860
I can take my wife's body back to Chongqing.

396
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:01,860
Please.

397
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:06,860
Okay.

398
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:07,860
I'm leaving.

399
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:31,860
I didn't expect

400
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:34,860
so many things

401
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:35,860
to happen in one night.

402
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:40,860
It's a pity

403
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:41,860
that I didn't help you.

404
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:44,860
I was just about to look for you.

405
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:48,860
Now Zuo Zuo is not dead.

406
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:50,860
Liang Jingyuan is missing.

407
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:52,860
I'm afraid

408
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:54,860
you can't find him.

409
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:57,860
I'm afraid

410
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:58,860
Zuo Zuo is not dead.

411
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:00,860
Liang Jingyuan is missing.

412
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:03,860
The Japanese will be

413
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:04,860
the only informant

414
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:06,860
in the new government's intelligence system.

415
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:09,860
It's a pity

416
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:12,860
that we can't share the burden.

417
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:17,860
You have a big hand.

418
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:22,860
Are you in such a hurry to drive me away?

419
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:28,860
I'm going back to Chongqing by boat.

420
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:32,860
Once he reports you and the Communist Party of the People's Republic of China

421
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:33,860
to my superior,

422
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:36,860
Chongqing will take all the cost

423
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:39,860
and kill you both.

424
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:43,860
This is

425
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:45,860
the ticket to Hong Kong.

426
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:46,860
Now Dongyue Temple is closed.

427
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:49,860
I also entered the Qingxiang Memorial Committee.

428
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:52,860
I need Li Yuese.

429
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:54,860
Right? I will say

430
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:56,860
Li Yuese is in a bad mood because of the Chinese flu.

431
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:58,860
So he can't continue his work.

432
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:00,860
When you arrive in Hong Kong,

433
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:02,860
you can decide where to go.

434
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:06,860
You think I've experienced so much.

435
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:08,860
Can life and death

436
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:10,860
threaten us?

437
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:19,860
By the way,

438
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:21,860
about your mother,

439
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:23,860
I'm sorry.

440
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:25,860
It's okay.

441
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:29,860
Teacher,

442
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:31,860
you made this?

443
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:35,860
Your mother made it.

444
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:37,860
Bai Maohu sent it to me.

445
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:43,860
I actually made the other one myself.

446
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:46,860
Your mother is fine in Bai Maohu.

447
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:48,860
My people are just responsible for protecting her.

448
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:50,860
I didn't disturb her.

449
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:52,860
When you arrive in Hong Kong,

450
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:53,860
I will send it to you.

451
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:55,860
Really?

452
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:00,860
You think you threaten my mother

453
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:01,860
over and over again.

454
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:03,860
I'm not that stupid

455
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:06,860
to leave her in Bai Maohu.

456
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:13,860
You're right. I forgot

457
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:15,860
you're a member of the organization.

458
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:19,860
Okay.

459
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:21,860
From now on,

460
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:23,860
we will not drink water.

461
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:25,860
You stay in your code research center.

462
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:34,440
I'll be in the committee of the

463
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:40,860
Here's the noodles.

464
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:43,860
Here's your noodles.

465
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:50,860
It's good.

466
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:53,860
It's good.

467
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:55,860
It's the same taste as two years ago.

468
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:56,860
It hasn't changed at all.

469
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:58,860
Try it.

470
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:21,860
It's really interesting.

471
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:24,860
I remember two years ago,

472
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:28,860
we were sitting in the same position.

473
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:31,860
At that time,

474
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:32,860
you advised me to stay.

475
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:34,860
But today,

476
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:36,860
you're holding me back.

477
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:40,860
But at that time,

478
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:41,860
you were in a rage.

479
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:43,860
But now,

480
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:46,860
you're more angry.

481
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:48,860
Yes.

482
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:50,860
At that time,

483
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:51,860
we were fighting side by side.

484
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:57,860
And that day,

485
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:01,860
I was really sorry to you.

486
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:06,860
You also told me that you were the first to decide

487
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:07,860
the number of people,

488
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:08,860
the time,

489
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:09,860
and the time to eat and drink.

490
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:12,860
You didn't lie to me.

491
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:18,860
Eat more.

492
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:20,860
Go back to Chongqing.

493
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:21,860
The mountains are long and the water is far.

494
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:33,860
Boss,

495
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:34,860
the soup is too salty.

496
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:44,860
Ask me in silence.

497
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:48,860
What's the story of the letter you wrote before?

498
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:49,860
I'm sorry.

499
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:50,860
I told you the truth.

500
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:53,860
You colluded with Liang Jingyuan

501
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:54,860
and tried to frame me.

502
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:57,860
The four people you see now

503
00:37:57,860 --> 00:38:00,860
are all under the command of General An Jing.

504
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:02,860
They will take you back

505
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:03,860
to be examined immediately.

506
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:14,860
Aren't you afraid that I will tell them

507
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:16,860
your identity and the identity of Xian Biyu?

508
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:20,860
I met Charlie in the UK.

509
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:23,860
Charlie insisted on being my assistant.

510
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:25,860
I have no idea who he is

511
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:27,860
and what he has done.

512
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:35,860
Do you think that An Jing is the one who will believe Charlie

513
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:40,860
or the only survivor of the Dongyuan Temple family?

514
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:42,860
Joseph Lee?

515
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:47,860
Don't forget to say that I made you Joseph Lee.

516
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:49,860
I will be there.

517
00:38:58,860 --> 00:38:59,860
Gu,

518
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:01,860
please follow me.

519
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:09,860
I'm just investigating.

520
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:10,860
No problem.

521
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:12,860
I will investigate it carefully.

522
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:17,860
Let's go.

523
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:18,860
Wait a minute.

524
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:36,860
Charlie,

525
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:39,860
explain it to me.

526
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:48,860
Wait, wait, wait.

527
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:49,860
Let's go.

528
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:54,860
Are you crazy?

529
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:57,860
You were right.

530
00:39:57,860 --> 00:39:58,860
It's just an examination.

531
00:39:58,860 --> 00:39:59,860
It's not scary at all.

532
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:01,860
But it's different now.

533
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:03,860
You used your gun

534
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:05,860
to kill four Japanese soldiers.

535
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:06,860
According to the Japanese,

536
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:07,860
you know that

537
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:09,860
they will come to shoot you.

538
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:12,860
They are all under the command of General An Jing.

539
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:13,860
As long as you shoot,

540
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:16,860
the rear army they arranged will come.

541
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:17,860
It only takes two minutes.

542
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:20,860
So now you have two minutes

543
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:21,860
to escape.

544
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:23,860
Arrest me.

545
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:26,860
It's in Hong Kong.

546
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:27,860
I arranged a car for you.

547
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:29,860
The key is in the car.

548
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:31,860
You will send back to Chongqing

549
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:32,860
the thing that you and I are fighting against.

550
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:34,860
You and the Communist Party are separated.

551
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:35,860
Only in this way

552
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:36,860
can you keep

553
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:38,860
the whole family of your family.

554
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:44,860
Is this your plan?

555
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:49,860
You only have one and a half minutes.

556
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:51,860
Think it over.

557
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:52,860
Only if you leave now,

558
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:54,860
you will be the only survivor.

559
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:03,860
Interesting.

560
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:05,860
I used your mother to deceive you.

561
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:06,860
Now you have

562
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:07,860
put my father in it.

563
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:10,860
This is not a plan.

564
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:11,860
This is the fact.

565
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:14,860
And these are

566
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:15,860
what you taught me before.

567
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:17,860
Emotions

568
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:19,860
should always be in the position.

569
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:22,860
Our position

570
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:24,860
is different.

571
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:28,860
Okay.

572
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:32,860
Then we will wait for them quietly.

573
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:48,860
The End

574
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:09,860
Don't come over.

575
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:11,860
If you come over, I will kill him.

576
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:12,860
Don't come over.

577
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:18,860
Don't shoot.

578
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:20,860
Don't hurt him.

579
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:27,860
Take this.

580
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:31,860
Sir, are you okay?

581
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:32,860
Hurry up.

582
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:33,860
Hurry up.

583
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:34,860
Go to the house where the girl is.

584
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:35,860
Yes.

585
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:48,860
Go.

586
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:17,860
Don't shoot.

587
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:47,860
Don't shoot.

588
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:18,860
Don't shoot.

589
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:49,860
She is watching

590
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:53,860
the vast night

591
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:56,860
A beam of light

592
00:44:56,860 --> 00:45:00,860
A wound that has fallen

593
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:04,860
She is watching

594
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:07,860
the shadow of the wandering

595
00:45:07,860 --> 00:45:10,860
The night is dark

596
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:14,860
Looking back, it is also the night

597
00:45:14,860 --> 00:45:17,860
She is watching

598
00:45:17,860 --> 00:45:21,860
the vast night

599
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:24,860
A beam of light

600
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:28,860
A wound that has fallen

601
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:32,860
She is watching

602
00:45:32,860 --> 00:45:35,860
the shadow of the wandering

603
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:38,860
The night is dark

604
00:45:38,860 --> 00:45:42,860
Looking back, it is also the night

605
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:46,860
The night is dark

606
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:52,860
Looking back, it is also the night
