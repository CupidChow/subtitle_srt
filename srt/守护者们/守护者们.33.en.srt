1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:25,700
Welcome to the

2
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:58,700
The company commander said that this air-raid shelter is very hidden.

3
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,700
Even the servants at home don't know the entrance.

4
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:01,700
So don't worry.

5
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,700
Don't kill me. Don't kill me.

6
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,700
I'm not a traitor.

7
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:06,700
Don't kill me.

8
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:07,700
Don't kill me.

9
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:08,700
I'm not a traitor.

10
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:09,700
Don't kill me.

11
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:10,700
I'm not a traitor.

12
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:11,700
I'm a security guard.

13
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:12,700
Don't be afraid.

14
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:14,700
It's okay.

15
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:15,700
I'm really not a traitor.

16
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:18,700
It's okay.

17
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:19,700
Don't be afraid.

18
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:20,700
Don't be afraid.

19
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:26,700
I'm not a traitor.

20
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:27,700
It's okay.

21
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:28,700
Don't be afraid.

22
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,700
I'm really not a traitor.

23
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:34,700
It's okay.

24
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:40,700
Miss Meng,

25
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:42,700
I have a sister named Hongyu.

26
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:46,700
She is half as young as you.

27
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:50,700
But she is very brave.

28
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,700
Do you want to hear her story?

29
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:11,700
I have only done two things in my life.

30
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:14,700
First, I was punished by the law.

31
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:16,700
Second, I was a rebel.

32
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,700
I raised two good children.

33
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,700
They are all good children who are good at acting.

34
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:32,700
Mother,

35
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:36,700
I'm still a good son.

36
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:38,700
It's none of your business.

37
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:43,700
I know what kind of a character Dean Jiang Wei is.

38
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:48,700
From the moment I resigned,

39
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:53,700
I knew that the Gu family would have this kind of a ending.

40
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:13,700
Isn't this the reason why you don't want to leave the mountain?

41
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,700
I don't want to leave the mountain.

42
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,700
It's because of this.

43
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:41,700
Why does it look like Bingqing's handwriting?

44
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:45,700
I know you will recognize his handwriting.

45
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:50,700
Then what's the blood on it?

46
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,700
Isn't it a heart disease that occurred when he was traveling?

47
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:56,700
On March 24, 1925,

48
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:03,700
the General Staff of the North Command ordered the Shanghai Public Security Bureau to send 500 military officers

49
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:07,700
to guard the students of Fudan University at night.

50
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:09,700
They arrested six people.

51
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:11,700
The next day,

52
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:15,700
they arrested one person in charge of the Student Salvation Committee.

53
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:21,700
The military police and students had a conflict.

54
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,700
The city opened fire and the rest of the city was destroyed.

55
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,700
The students were injured.

56
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,700
There were more than 20 people.

57
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,700
One of them was killed.

58
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:33,700
The next day,

59
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,700
the injured were unconscious.

60
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:39,700
This incident

61
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:42,700
was a violation of the Civil Code

62
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,700
just announced by the National Government.

63
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:52,700
I was the one who carried out the entire operation.

64
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:55,700
My husband,

65
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,700
if he hadn't thought of it,

66
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:04,700
he would have been in the Student Salvation Committee.

67
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:10,700
That day,

68
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,700
I was in the wrong every day.

69
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:19,700
I didn't understand

70
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,700
that the soldier who died in the war was the soldier who died in the war.

71
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:30,700
Later,

72
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,700
it was my husband who reminded me

73
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:35,700
that my husband

74
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,700
was the most important person

75
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,700
in the Gu family.

76
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:02,700
From that day on,

77
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,700
I didn't want to resign.

78
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:12,700
But the country was so strong that it could not leave.

79
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:16,700
For the past ten years,

80
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,700
I have been watching the country

81
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,700
fall down day by day.

82
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,700
If the soldier saw the scene today,

83
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:30,700
would he think his sacrifice was worth it?

84
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:36,700
What about me?

85
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:39,700
Did I make a wrong choice

86
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:41,700
from beginning to end

87
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:43,700
over the years?

88
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,700
My faith, my choice,

89
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,700
and my education to you

90
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:51,700
were all wrong.

91
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:05,700
Yang Shan,

92
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:09,700
my path

93
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,700
may have been wrong.

94
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,700
But I have already come to an end.

95
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:17,700
It's time to retreat.

96
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:20,700
But you are different.

97
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:22,700
You just started.

98
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:24,700
How to go on this road,

99
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:27,700
you must think clearly.

100
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:31,700
You have to be careful.

101
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,700
Don't let the Gu family's roots

102
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:38,700
hold you back.

103
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,700
Father, I have thought it through.

104
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:52,700
A generation

105
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,700
has its own path to go.

106
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:58,700
I will not

107
00:08:58,700 --> 00:08:59,700
and can not

108
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,700
walk your old path again.

109
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:06,700
But our Gu family

110
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,700
has never escaped from the State of Chu.

111
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:25,700
Report, Vice Commander.

112
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:26,700
No one was found.

113
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:32,700
Impossible.

114
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,700
We have searched everywhere.

115
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,700
We didn't even find a crack.

116
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:38,700
There is really nothing.

117
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:43,700
We have to search

118
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:45,700
every house in Shanghai.

119
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:48,700
Come one by one.

120
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:49,700
Yes.

121
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:04,700
Captain Luo,

122
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:08,700
have you found him?

123
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:24,700
Although I haven't found him,

124
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,700
I know very well

125
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,700
that you have an old friend.

126
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,700
You have a duty.

127
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,700
I should have done my best to cooperate.

128
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:37,700
I was impulsive.

129
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:39,700
I'm sorry.

130
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:40,700
Please

131
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:42,700
tell Secretary Liu

132
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,700
I'm sorry.

133
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:49,700
Go ahead.

134
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:54,700
Father

135
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:56,700
taught me

136
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:57,700
and taught me.

137
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,700
He said I was too reckless

138
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:01,700
and too impulsive.

139
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,700
I should think twice before doing anything.

140
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,700
I should know how to take advantage of the situation.

141
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:10,700
And most importantly,

142
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:12,700
I should listen to the commander

143
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:14,700
and the commander-in-chief.

144
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:16,700
So

145
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,700
I just want to apologize to you.

146
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:22,700
I'm sorry.

147
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:30,700
Go.

148
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:43,700
Go.

149
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:44,700
Go.

150
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,700
Take care, Captain Luo.

151
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,700
Is Miss Hongyu dead?

152
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,700
I met a few Japanese soldiers.

153
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:31,700
If it weren't for her,

154
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:34,700
Ding Yi might not have stayed.

155
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:37,700
What happened after that

156
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:39,700
might not have happened.

157
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:42,700
Why?

158
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:46,700
What did she do wrong?

159
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,700
What did I do wrong?

160
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:50,700
You didn't do anything wrong.

161
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:55,700
What you did

162
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:57,700
was wrong.

163
00:12:58,700 --> 00:12:59,700
It was this world.

164
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:03,700
Then why did we

165
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:07,700
live so hard

166
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:10,700
in this world?

167
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:15,700
I don't know.

168
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:17,700
I don't know.

169
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,700
It's because of the hard work we've been through

170
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,700
that we have to work hard to change.

171
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,700
To run towards a new end.

172
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,700
Go.

173
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,700
Go.

174
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:51,700
The car to the detention center

175
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:52,700
will arrive in a few hours.

176
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:54,700
This time

177
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,700
is your only chance to leave Shanghai.

178
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,700
You have to hurry up and get in the car.

179
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:08,700
Let's go together.

180
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:21,700
I know

181
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:23,700
you wanted to leave a long time ago.

182
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:25,700
You just checked an invitation.

183
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:28,700
Five years ago,

184
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:29,700
you invited me

185
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:31,700
to join the assassination operation.

186
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:32,700
And today,

187
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:34,700
I'm the one who invited you

188
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:37,700
to join us.

189
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:41,700
We worked together

190
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:43,700
to solve Wu Tian,

191
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:44,700
Zuo Zuo Mu

192
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:45,700
and Liang Jing Yuan.

193
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:48,700
From now on,

194
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:49,700
we should work together

195
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:50,700
with other comrades

196
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,700
to protect the new life under the sun.

197
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:56,700
Do you also

198
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:58,700
have security measures for me?

199
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:02,700
No.

200
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:04,700
In fact, in these years,

201
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:06,700
I often remember

202
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:08,700
the way we fought together

203
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:09,700
back then.

204
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:12,700
Lin Yi, actually,

205
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:15,700
I've been wanting to find you for a long time.

206
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:16,700
I want to follow the same path as you.

207
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:18,700
Because I believe

208
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:20,700
the path you take

209
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:22,700
will become more and more bright

210
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:24,700
and clearer.

211
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:27,700
But

212
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:29,700
my father is old.

213
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:31,700
And these years,

214
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,700
he has been

215
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:35,700
in the dark.

216
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:37,700
If I go to you

217
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:39,700
without any hesitation,

218
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:40,700
my father

219
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:44,700
will be

220
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:46,700
a little bit more beautiful.

221
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:51,700
But now,

222
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:53,700
my father has submitted his resignation.

223
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,700
And he will go abroad tomorrow.

224
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:58,700
Just like what I just told you.

225
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:01,700
I don't care.

226
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:10,700
When did it start to shake?

227
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:15,700
When Lin Zhen escaped from the grassland,

228
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:18,700
and when Uncle Gu found out

229
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:20,700
that it was the Communist Party.

230
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:23,700
And when Dean Jiang Wei

231
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:25,700
started the Manchurian Rebellion.

232
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:27,700
And when Chongqing

233
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:28,700
spared Liang Jingyuan's life

234
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,700
for the sake of profit.

235
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:36,700
So, all these years,

236
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:37,700
you have been

237
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:40,700
the one

238
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:42,700
who has been acting blind.

239
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:49,700
Okay,

240
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:50,700
stop talking nonsense.

241
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:52,700
Come with us.

242
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:53,700
Go to the hospital together.

243
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:55,700
You have to be my partner.

244
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:57,700
Don't forget

245
00:17:58,700 --> 00:17:59,700
that we were in Sanyang

246
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,700
in the same bed.

247
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:02,700
What did I tell you?

248
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:05,700
When the war is over,

249
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,700
we will find a restaurant with a mountain and a river.

250
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:13,700
You can take Miss Mo home.

251
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:15,700
We will be neighbors.

252
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:17,700
If you have no oil,

253
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:19,700
you can go to my house.

254
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:21,700
If you have no face,

255
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:23,700
you can go to your house.

256
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:28,700
When we have children,

257
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:31,700
we will give them money.

258
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:33,700
If they are all girls,

259
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:35,700
we will be okay.

260
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:37,700
We will make them happy.

261
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:40,700
I also look forward to that day.

262
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:42,700
And I believe it will be soon.

263
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,700
But not now.

264
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,700
Now, you have a task to complete.

265
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:50,700
Leave it to me.

266
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:52,700
I will complete the task for you.

267
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:55,700
Tell me your contact information.

268
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:58,700
Then you and Miss Xian

269
00:18:58,700 --> 00:18:59,700
will go to your wedding

270
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:00,700
as the directors.

271
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:02,700
Leave the rest to me.

272
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:07,700
I am more familiar with Shanghai than you.

273
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:09,700
It should be easier

274
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:11,700
to find those doctors.

275
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:14,700
I have also witnessed

276
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:16,700
how Uncle Gu completed the task.

277
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:18,700
I also witnessed

278
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:19,700
how Bai Ye worked.

279
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:21,700
So I know

280
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:23,700
the Communist Party

281
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:24,700
will not give up

282
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:25,700
until the task is completed.

283
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:28,700
But Ding Yi,

284
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:30,700
you are different now.

285
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:32,700
You are not the same as before.

286
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:34,700
You are different now.

287
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:35,700
You are different now.

288
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:37,700
You have a wife.

289
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:38,700
You are getting married.

290
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:40,700
This task

291
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:42,700
is not something you cannot do.

292
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:48,700
There is a radio in my study.

293
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:50,700
I will report to your organization.

294
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,700
I will complete the task for you.

295
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:55,700
Finally, I have waited for this day.

296
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:56,700
I will ask the organization

297
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:58,700
to look forward to your arrival.

298
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,700
Comrade Gu Yanshan.

299
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:05,700
What is going on?

300
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:20,700
What are you doing?

301
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:22,700
Don't move.

302
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:23,700
Stop!

303
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:36,700
What are you doing?

304
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:37,700
Stop!

305
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:38,700
What are you doing?

306
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:49,700
Hurry up!

307
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:52,700
Hurry up!

308
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:02,700
Brother Shixian.

309
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:05,700
See you in the new world.

310
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:09,700
See you in the new world.

311
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:18,700
Let's go.

312
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:26,700
When you arrive in Yan'an,

313
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:27,700
we will take a photo

314
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:28,700
of that river.

315
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:31,700
Okay.

316
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:32,700
Wait for me in Yan'an.

317
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:33,700
I also want to see

318
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:34,700
the new world.

319
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:37,700
Let's go.

320
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:39,700
Okay.

321
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:04,700
Yan'an

322
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:33,700
Gu Yanshan

323
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:41,700
Comrade Gu Yanshan

324
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:49,700
Comrade Lao Xiao

325
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,700
We have been waiting for you for a long time.

326
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:54,700
We finally meet you.

327
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:56,700
There is nothing here.

328
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:58,700
Nothing there.

329
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:00,700
Except that there is nothing.

330
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:01,700
What else do you want to say?

331
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:02,700
I'm sorry.

332
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:03,700
I'm sorry.

333
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:04,700
So many people

334
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,700
and you didn't catch even one person.

335
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:08,700
Will the Communist Party

336
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,700
fly with its wings?

337
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:19,700
Impossible.

338
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:22,700
I know them.

339
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:25,700
Yesterday,

340
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,700
they must have been in the orphanage.

341
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:32,700
Yes.

342
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:37,700
What's wrong with your forehead?

343
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:40,700
This one.

344
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:41,700
Yesterday, we had a hand

345
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:42,700
and happened to meet a fugitive

346
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:43,700
in the police department.

347
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:44,700
It's a misunderstanding.

348
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:03,700
I'm afraid this is not a misunderstanding.

349
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:07,700
Now the Sujian Committee

350
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,700
is introducing the name of the fugitive.

351
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,700
It's actually the underground battle power

352
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,700
of the Communist Party during the Qing and Chu anti-Japanese.

353
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:16,700
Comrade Lao Xiao

354
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:18,700
What else can I do?

355
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:20,700
No trouble.

356
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:22,700
I'm afraid

357
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:24,700
you can't do anything.

358
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:26,700
I'm afraid

359
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:28,700
you can't do anything.

360
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:30,700
I'm afraid

361
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:32,700
you can't do anything.

362
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:35,700
The Luo Committee of the Sujian Committee

363
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:36,700
has been busy for more than half a month.

364
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:39,700
He didn't catch any of our comrades.

365
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:41,700
And

366
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:42,700
he doesn't have many opportunities.

367
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,700
What's the result of the Chongqing negotiation?

368
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:49,700
We've been fighting.

369
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,700
Now the peace is very high.

370
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,700
Chairman Jiang can't stand the pressure.

371
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,700
Now he's starting to compromise.

372
00:24:58,700 --> 00:24:59,700
I think

373
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:02,700
the result came out in these two days.

374
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:06,700
Great.

375
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:09,700
I've been in Chongqing during the anti-Japanese war.

376
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:11,700
The front line won a battle.

377
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:14,700
The people put a handkerchief on the side.

378
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:16,700
And the front line lost a battle.

379
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:20,700
The people hung a white flag on the street.

380
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:23,700
This is the sadness of the people to the country.

381
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,700
After the anti-Japanese war, I've been worried

382
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:30,700
if one day we fight a civil war,

383
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,700
every family has a father and a son.

384
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:35,700
Brother Cao,

385
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:37,700
how do you make them happy?

386
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:39,700
How to carry?

387
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:40,700
And who is the one who put a handkerchief on?

388
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,700
Who is the one who hung a white flag?

389
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:46,700
I think

390
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:49,700
you have an answer.

391
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:53,700
Comrade Lao Xiao,

392
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:55,700
my application for joining the party...

393
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:56,700
Comrade Gu Yanshan,

394
00:25:58,700 --> 00:25:59,700
I officially inform you that

395
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:01,700
your application for joining the party

396
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:05,700
has been approved by the organization.

397
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:07,700
From today,

398
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:11,700
you are an official Communist Party member.

399
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:16,700
Comrade,

400
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:20,700
I've been waiting for this day

401
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:23,700
for too long.

402
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:27,700
Comrade Lao Xiao,

403
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:29,700
when can I

404
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:31,700
go to Yan'an to visit?

405
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:33,700
Comrade Gu Yanshan,

406
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:34,700
the organization has decided

407
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:37,700
to leave Shanghai as soon as possible

408
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:39,700
when your father goes to the UK for treatment.

409
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:40,700
When you go back to the city,

410
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:42,700
our comrades will pick you up.

411
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:44,700
Then you will go straight to Yan'an

412
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:46,700
to receive the training of the organization.

413
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:49,700
There will be more important tasks waiting for you in the future.

414
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:53,700
Okay.

415
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:54,700
Okay.

416
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:55,700
Okay.

417
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:58,700
I understand, Captain Dai.

418
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:00,700
I will arrange it well.

419
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:02,700
Don't worry.

420
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:07,700
Commander,

421
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:08,700
I've checked it.

422
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:10,700
The police department

423
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:11,700
has lost a car.

424
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:16,700
Liu Fujing,

425
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:17,700
the new manager of the police department,

426
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:18,700
is their former department.

427
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:20,700
I'm 100% sure

428
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,700
that he must have released these Communists.

429
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:27,700
Boss Dai has just told me

430
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:30,700
that Chongqing has already made a deal

431
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:33,700
to stop all activities

432
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:35,700
of the Communist Party's underground operation

433
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:36,700
in Shanghai.

434
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:38,700
Don't think too much.

435
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:42,700
What's the situation?

436
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:44,700
No,

437
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:46,700
I don't understand

438
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:49,700
how much grudge you and Yanshan have created.

439
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:52,700
You searched and searched,

440
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:53,700
searched and searched,

441
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:54,700
searched and searched,

442
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:55,700
and smashed you.

443
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:56,700
You didn't find

444
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,700
any Communists in his house.

445
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:01,700
What else do you want?

446
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:03,700
Just search.

447
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:05,700
But his family is obsessed with the sound of the party,

448
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:06,700
taking advantage of the party,

449
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:08,700
but he is always out of line,

450
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:09,700
protecting the Communist Party.

451
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:11,700
Such a country is a burden.

452
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,700
We don't know when we will die.

453
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:18,700
You are really a gold, Captain.

454
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:20,700
Don't say he is not a Communist.

455
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,700
Even if he is a Communist,

456
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,700
how can you catch him?

457
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:25,700
I...

458
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:27,700
How can you catch him in prison

459
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:30,700
and be his friend with General Ye Ting?

460
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:33,700
You let General Ye Ting write another song

461
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:36,700
about why the door is locked

462
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:40,700
and why it is open.

463
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,700
You are promoting the Communist Party

464
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:45,700
and collecting materials.

465
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:54,700
Boss Dai is very easy to deal with.

466
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:58,700
He is the one who was taught by

467
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:03,700
Gu Zhengze and Commander Chen Shaokuan.

468
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:07,700
He said three words

469
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:08,700
after he got the capital.

470
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:11,700
Yang Xi Pi.

471
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:19,700
Boss Dai thought it over.

472
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:23,700
He is just a hot fish.

473
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:24,700
He is not a fish.

474
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,700
He is not a fish.

475
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:29,700
Tomorrow, he will be sent to Nanjing.

476
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:32,700
He will be the deputy director of the Secret Telecommunications Bureau.

477
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:34,700
He will do research

478
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:36,700
and not show himself.

479
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:38,700
Don't worry.

480
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:40,700
I am not worried.

481
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:43,700
He will be the deputy director.

482
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:45,700
He will not be promoted.

483
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,700
And he has colluded with the Bureau

484
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:50,700
and exposed the photos of our committee.

485
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:51,700
Is that all?

486
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:56,700
Boss Dai said

487
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:59,700
that some people in Shanghai

488
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:03,700
have made a lot of money.

489
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:05,700
They must be punished severely.

490
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:09,700
What did he find?

491
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:10,700
What did he find?

492
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:18,700
The Meng family's house

493
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:20,700
was sold to Mao Mian.

494
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:22,700
The procedures were completed.

495
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:24,700
What do you think

496
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,700
should be done?

497
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:29,700
Director Cao.

498
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:32,700
Why is it so difficult

499
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:35,700
to defend the country?

500
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:40,700
I am the only one

501
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:41,700
who knows about the situation

502
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,700
in the Si Tu Meng house.

503
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:44,700
All the directors of the Mao family

504
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:45,700
know about it.

505
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:47,700
I am willing to

506
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:49,700
resign

507
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:53,700
and quit my job.

508
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:01,700
I am a man of my word.

509
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:03,700
I am willing to

510
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:05,700
resign

511
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:07,700
and quit my job.

512
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:11,700
Deputy Director.

513
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:14,700
You don't have to do this.

514
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:18,700
Deputy Director Meng means

515
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:20,700
that we will have a

516
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:21,700
anti-corruption campaign

517
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:22,700
in the Bureau next month.

518
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:24,700
You don't have to participate.

519
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:29,700
Just do what you have to do

520
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:31,700
and give an explanation to the next generation.

521
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:32,700
What about you?

522
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:33,700
What should you do?

523
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:34,700
Deputy Director.

524
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:37,700
Just do as I said.

525
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:42,700
This is my value.

526
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:53,700
Meng.

527
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:54,700
Help me get it

528
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:55,700
to the car nearby.

529
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:56,700
Okay.

530
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:57,700
Help me.

531
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:58,700
It's okay. I can get it.

532
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:10,700
Come on.

533
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:33,700
Ning Shan.

534
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:36,700
Sir.

535
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:37,700
What's up?

536
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:39,700
I am here to congratulate you.

537
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:41,700
Nanjing has just become

538
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:42,700
a secret police station.

539
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:43,700
Director Dai

540
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:44,700
recommended you to be the deputy director.

541
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:49,700
Look.

542
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:51,700
The people are here.

543
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:52,700
Look.

544
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:53,700
Sir.

545
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:54,700
Please help me

546
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:56,700
express my condolences to Director Dai.

547
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:57,700
But you know that

548
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:59,700
my father is not well.

549
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:00,700
I have to accompany him

550
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:02,700
to the UK for treatment.

551
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:05,700
I understand.

552
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:07,700
You are a big boy.

553
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:09,700
Director Dai has been thinking

554
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:11,700
about Commander Gu's health.

555
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:13,700
You can rest assured

556
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:15,700
if you send someone to accompany him.

557
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:17,700
Sir.

558
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,700
I can go with whoever I want.

559
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:21,700
I am relieved

560
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:22,700
if I go.

561
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:25,700
What are you doing?

562
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:26,700
Ning Shan.

563
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:27,700
What are you doing?

564
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:29,700
Sir.

565
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:30,700
Be quiet.

566
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:33,700
Sir.

567
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:35,700
Sir.

568
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:36,700
You are a rare

569
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:37,700
secret talent of our party.

570
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:40,700
You can't leave.

571
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:43,700
The secret code

572
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:44,700
of the research project

573
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:45,700
of the research project

574
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:46,700
is very important

575
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:48,700
to the American experts.

576
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:50,700
How can we let you go

577
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:54,700
if you are such a talent?

578
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:58,700
Ning Shan.

579
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:02,700
Director Gu.

580
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:04,700
Please.

581
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:16,700
A short peace

582
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:18,700
has been fighting for 14 years

583
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:20,700
for 40,000 Chinese people.

584
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:22,700
To break it,

585
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:25,700
we need to make a difference.

586
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:28,700
In June 1946,

587
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:29,700
the KMT publicly

588
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:31,700
broken the Twin Towers Agreement

589
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:33,700
and launched a full-scale war

590
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:35,700
to pursue a peaceful China.

591
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:38,700
With the right leadership

592
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:40,700
of the people,

593
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:42,700
the People's Liberation Army

594
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:44,700
took the red flag

595
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:46,700
across the North of the Yangtze River in just three years.

596
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:50,700
The tiger, the dragon and the tiger

597
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:53,700
all rose up and fell down.

598
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:55,700
On the battlefield

599
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:57,700
the warriors with their heads in the wind

600
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:59,700
finally came

601
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:01,700
the dawn of liberation.

602
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:27,700
Comrade Li Yun,

603
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:30,700
I was about to go to school.

604
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:32,700
I heard that a postman came.

605
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:33,700
I was very happy.

606
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:36,700
But,

607
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:38,700
there was no letter from you.

608
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:41,700
I was reading the pages at night.

609
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:44,700
I don't know if you received the letter.

610
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:47,700
I had to write another one.

611
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:55,700
Since I understood what Guiyang Mountain gave me,

612
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:58,700
the postman was responsible for the password.

613
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:00,700
I think I've become a password expert.

614
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:03,700
The postman was responsible for the password.

615
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:05,700
During the day, I had to teach the training class.

616
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:09,700
In the evening, I had to break the ground code.

617
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:12,700
I felt insomnia.

618
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:15,700
Fortunately, I didn't lose sleep.

619
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:18,700
I'm feeling good.

620
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:20,700
I hope you can rest assured.

621
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:21,700
I heard that

622
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:23,700
the spring will be in the south.

623
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:25,700
I never thought that

624
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:27,700
it would be in the south.

625
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:29,700
I'm still not sure.

626
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:37,700
The place is in the south.

627
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:40,700
I think you are very busy at the East Bureau.

628
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:43,700
I shouldn't have urged you to reply.

629
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:46,700
But, I thought about it.

630
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:48,700
There is one thing

631
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:49,700
that I want to tell you.

632
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:52,700
The main task is to get here from here.

633
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:57,700
The marriage was delayed because of the difference in the color.

634
00:36:58,700 --> 00:36:59,700
I feel sorry for you.

635
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:01,700
Since the war,

636
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:04,700
you and I have been fighting less.

637
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:06,700
Yesterday, the commanding officer said that

638
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:11,700
everyone in the troupe was willing to contact you.

639
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:14,700
Everyone was willing to contact you.

640
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:16,700
We are willing to contact you.

641
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:18,700
On the day of liberation,

642
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:20,700
we will have a new marriage.

643
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:23,700
The old and the new will be the same.

644
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:25,700
What do you think?

645
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:33,700
It's already midnight.

646
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:37,700
The time is running out.

647
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:40,700
I have to make a move.

648
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:41,700
I will make a move.

649
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:45,700
I will remember the past.

650
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:49,700
The love will be short.

651
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:53,700
I will kiss you.

652
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:12,700
Miss Xian,

653
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:14,700
the smile will make you more beautiful.

654
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:16,700
I will push myself a little harder.

655
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:43,700
That mysterious gases in Shanghai 하나네네이었어요.

656
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:53,300
又是这部电台。 I'm playing the radio again.

657
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:55,700
丁玉同志。 Comrade Ding Yi.

658
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:58,300
老徐啊。伯尼同志。 Oh, Xu. Comrade Ding Yi.

659
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:00,500
怎么了?前线出事了? What's wrong? Did something happen to the front line?

660
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:02,100
县组长他们非常好。 They're doing well.

661
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:03,500
最近他们滑动去, In the East China District,

662
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:05,120
在破译工作上遇到了一些困难。 they've been having some problems when they're working on the

663
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,000
破译工作上遇到一些困难。 breaking-in work.

664
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,900
他们正在做解放上海的情报准备工作。 They are preparing to

665
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:09,700
最近他们发现上海有一部新的电台。 work for the flood prevention of Shanghai.

666
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:12,500
Recently, I found out that there is a new radio station in Shanghai.

667
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:15,100
The password and password of the radio station is very strange.

668
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:16,200
It's hard to decipher.

669
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:18,700
I want you to send me these codes.

670
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:20,700
I'll show you.

671
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:32,900
The password of the contract.

672
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:41,700
The password of the contract.

673
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:03,700
Why do you have to use the code of the contract?

674
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:05,700
Just like the previous codes.

675
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:07,900
If you want to design a new one,

676
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:10,500
you have to let the Communist Army decipher it.

677
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:13,100
Can you call that a password?

678
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:15,900
That's just a trick.

679
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:18,700
What trick? You can't even call it a trick.

680
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:20,400
Those people are...

681
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,900
What kind of red tents are they in?

682
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:23,700
They're sitting inside and eating peanuts.

683
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:25,900
They're just kids.

684
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:30,300
And the CCP's people who are trying to decipher it

685
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:32,800
are eavesdropping on our videos every day.

686
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,100
It's like the festival.

687
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:35,500
We're just missing one person.

688
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:38,000
We're just missing one person.

689
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,100
Then it's not necessary to use Li Yue's code again.

690
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:42,900
This is a set of decoded codes.

691
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:44,900
The Jiao Tu plan is so important.

692
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:48,100
How can we use a decoded code?

693
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:50,500
That code is even a high-level code

694
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:53,700
that everyone praises.

695
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:58,300
Since Guiyang Mountain was completely deciphered,

696
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:02,300
Director Mao has been thinking of a chance to use it again.

697
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:06,300
Why would you use it when it's in good condition?

698
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:11,600
Director, Li Yue's code is a secret.

699
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:14,500
I know. If the new decoder doesn't understand,

700
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:16,100
it's easy to make mistakes.

701
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:19,100
Unless Guiyang Mountain comes back.

702
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:30,500
Nanjing Power Station was removed last month.

703
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:34,500
Where did Guiyang Mountain go?

704
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:39,300
Director Mao gave him a ticket to Taiwan

705
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:43,100
because of his father.

706
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:46,700
He refused.

707
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:51,500
He said he wanted to return to Shanghai to work.

708
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:58,500
So? You agreed?

709
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:02,500
He's a Communist, Director Mao!

710
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:07,700
He's been in Nanjing for four years.

711
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:11,300
He's been living in a small house every day.

712
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:15,900
Why do you still think he's a Communist?

713
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:18,900
And about Ding Yi,

714
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:21,300
it's been almost ten years.

715
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:23,300
I almost know what he looks like.

716
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:25,100
It's almost ten years.

717
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:29,300
I don't believe a single word you say!

718
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:32,300
I...

719
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:40,300
I understand, Director Cao.

720
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:42,100
You're working on a new code.

721
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:45,500
It's a waste of time and effort. You don't have the patience.

722
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:49,700
You don't care if the map plan works.

723
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:52,100
What you want is to execute it as soon as possible,

724
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:55,500
and go to Taiwan as soon as possible, right?

725
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:59,300
Deputy Commander Luo, listen to me.

726
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:02,300
I won't tell anyone about this.

727
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:05,700
If you want to leave, leave as soon as possible.

728
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:11,500
The Communist Army has set up a million troops on the Yangtze River.

729
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:14,700
A million troops? What's that?

730
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:16,700
That's a lot of explosives.

731
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:18,300
It can't turn the tide.

732
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:21,700
It can't turn the tide. I won't let them have a good time.

733
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:25,900
The Communist Party loves to be good people.

734
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:28,100
They want the military and political

735
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:30,300
and they want the capital.

736
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:32,500
I just can't stand their

737
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:34,900
stubborn and arrogant attitude.

738
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:36,500
Since they want the capital so much,

739
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:39,700
then let them have a dead city.

740
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:44,300
Come in.

741
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:50,700
Who are you?

742
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:53,900
Teacher, it's me.

743
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:59,900
Chinese TV Series Exclusive YouTube

744
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:31,900
Chinese TV Series Exclusive YouTube

745
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:56,500
The pain in my eyes

746
00:44:56,500 --> 00:45:00,900
The fake play, the real person, I can't tell

747
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:03,700
Where is the wind going?

748
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:08,100
Whose window is shaking?

749
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:10,900
The heart is thinking

750
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:14,500
It's either you or me

751
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:18,100
It's watching

752
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:21,700
In the vast night

753
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:25,300
The tears are falling

754
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:28,900
A drop of the wound

755
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:32,500
It's watching

756
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:36,100
Wandering in the shadow

757
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:38,700
The night falls

758
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:43,300
Looking back, it's also the night

759
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:46,900
It's watching

760
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:50,500
In the vast night

761
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:54,100
The tears are falling

762
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:57,700
A drop of the wound

763
00:45:57,700 --> 00:46:01,300
It's watching

764
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:04,900
Wandering in the shadow

765
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:07,500
The night falls

766
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:12,100
Looking back, it's also the night

767
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:14,700
The night falls

768
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:20,300
Looking back, it's also the night

769
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:24,500
It's watching
