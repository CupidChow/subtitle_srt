00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The Long Ballad

2
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Long'er! Long'er!

4
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Close the door.

5
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Okay.

6
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Where is Long'er?

7
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Let her go.

8
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
You arrange their departure.

9
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
There is no news from the doctor.

10
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
If anything goes wrong,

11
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
we can make a plan.

12
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Okay.

13
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I'll arrange it.

14
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Don't pull it. Don't go.

15
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
It's the cold season.

16
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Where can we go to eat?

17
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Hurry up.

18
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I don't want to go.

19
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Don't let her break it.

20
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I beg you.

21
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I don't want to go.

22
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Where can I go?

23
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
This is my home.

24
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I want to go.

25
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Don't be mad.

26
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I've been looking for you.

27
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
What are you doing?

28
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I don't want to go.

29
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I don't want to go.

30
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I don't want to go.

31
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I don't want to go.

32
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Okay.

33
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Let's go.

34
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Okay.

35
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I don't want to go.

36
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Long'er,

37
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
take this

38
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
and keep it as a souvenir.

39
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Take this

40
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
and keep it as a souvenir.

41
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Long'er.

42
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Long'er.

43
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Mr. Xiao,

44
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I've told you many times.

45
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Don't play on the stairs.

46
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
It's dangerous.

47
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Let's go.

48
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Don't play here next time.

49
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Be good.

50
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Okay.

51
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Let's go.

52
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Let's go.

53
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Let's go.

54
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Enough, brother.

55
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Stop playing.

56
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Let's talk about something.

57
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Give me a shoulder massage.

58
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Luo Miao can't slip on her shoulder.

59
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
What massage?

60
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
If you massage my ears,

61
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I'll break my hand.

62
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
If you don't give me a shoulder massage,

63
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
how can I make Luo Miao?

64
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
You little bastard.

65
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I don't want to play.

66
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Stop playing.

67
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Mr. Xiao,

68
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
someone is giving you flowers again.

69
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Mr. Xiao,

70
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
only your surname is my enemy.

71
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
You are still yourself.

72
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Romeo,

73
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
get rid of your surname.

74
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
My little girl,

75
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
this is not how the script is written.

76
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
You can change my script,

77
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
but this is a different story.

78
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
It's a different story.

79
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
How can you change it?

80
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
It's too difficult.

81
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I'm stuck every time I get to this point.

82
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Mr. Zhao,

83
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
why don't you help me with the lyrics

84
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
when I perform?

85
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Oh my god.

86
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Don't go, Mr. Zhao.

87
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Come on.

88
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Hong Yun.

89
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Mr. Zhao.

90
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Zhuang.

91
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Zhuang.

92
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I heard you didn't come.

93
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
What are you doing?

94
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Are you ready?

95
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Come on, you can do it.

96
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Come on, turn around.

97
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Be careful.

98
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Come on.

99
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Come on.

100
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Come on, turn around.

101
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Turn around.

102
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Turn around.

103
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Miss Xian,

104
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
your smile will make you more beautiful.

105
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Come on.

106
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Long'er,

107
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
you know what I said, right?

108
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Mr. Zhao was angry with me.

109
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
What's the name?

110
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
It's the same as

111
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
changing a rose.

112
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Lucky.

113
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Lucky.

114
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Director,

115
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I'm really sorry to say

116
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:59,100
다리

117
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:12,700
üğ

118
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,680
시

119
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,640
Come on.

120
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,360
Now, look.

121
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,320
This one, he is...

122
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,160
He is...

123
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,360
He's from the kitchen.

124
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,560
He's been on the wanted list of the Japanese county police.

125
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,520
He just died yesterday.

126
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:38,680
So fucking fresh.

127
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,320
It's not even stinking yet.

128
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,920
It's just right for me.

129
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,160
Look.

130
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,840
You can tell the Japanese.

131
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,120
I promise you that within half an hour,

132
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,000
I'll get you into jail.

133
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,640
What the fuck?

134
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,640
What the fuck?

135
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,640
Look at it.

136
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,600
The results of the investigation have been released.

137
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,280
His name is Frank Archer.

138
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,560
He is the Deputy Commander of Wango Shantung.

139
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:36,080
He has been in China for a long time.

140
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:39,240
He is a few British people who can speak Chinese.

141
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:44,400
It's close.

142
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:50,000
I can't see what he's giving Shen Wei Yu.

143
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,280
He's probably the information source for Shen Wei Yu.

144
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,280
We can't let him escape.

145
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,280
Let's go.

146
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,600
Wu, any news?

147
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,800
Li Yi, Gu Yaoshan and Li Boyao

148
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,040
had a gunfight at the dock.

149
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,280
Several officers were killed there.

150
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:25,160
No, I found this at the scene.

151
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,640
I found him, too.

152
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,960
I just need you to decide who you get this for.

153
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,000
You just go and hide here.

154
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,400
I'll sneak in and see who it is.

155
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,720
Go tell your men to come and look for me.

156
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,840
You and your men's gang, come along.

157
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,840
Ah.

158
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,840
Ah.

159
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,840
Ah.

160
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,840
Hey.

161
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,840
Ah.

162
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,840
I know why you are so angry.

163
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,840
I did lie to you about your mother.

164
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:17,840
I'm sorry.

165
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,840
But your mother is fine in Bai Ma Hu now.

166
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,840
Nothing happened.

167
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,840
You can hit me.

168
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,840
As long as you can get rid of this anger today.

169
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,840
You can hit me however you want.

170
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,840
You said it.

171
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:33,840
I said it.

172
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,840
Come on.

173
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,840
Ah.

174
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,840
Are you done?

175
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:03,840
If you are not done.

176
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,840
Take a break.

177
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,840
Let me continue.

178
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,840
I'll hit you.

179
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,840
I'm telling you, Gu Yaoshan.

180
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,840
I will never listen to you again.

181
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,840
Then Ding Yi.

182
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,840
I'm telling you.

183
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:23,840
After this village.

184
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,840
There will be no more.

185
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,840
You are not thinking about it.

186
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,840
I'm telling you.

187
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,840
I will remember this for the rest of my life.

188
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,840
I will think about it once.

189
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:33,840
I will steal it from you.

190
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,840
You don't have to do it.

191
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,840
You can pay me back.

192
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:39,840
Okay.

193
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,840
I won't pay you back.

194
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:41,840
I won't pay you back.

195
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,840
I'm so tired.

196
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:58,840
Forget it.

197
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,840
You are lying.

198
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:07,840
I'm not blind.

199
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,840
Actually, I understand.

200
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:13,840
You did this.

201
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:17,840
For more people.

202
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:22,840
Ding Yi.

203
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,840
Thank you.

204
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:31,840
Your body is broken.

205
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,840
I lied to you.

206
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,840
Come.

207
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,840
Stand up.

208
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:45,840
What are you doing?

209
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:47,840
Stand up.

210
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,840
I told you to take a break.

211
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:53,840
What are you doing?

212
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,840
Why are you holding a gun?

213
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,840
We are not hurt enough.

214
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,840
Since we came back.

215
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,840
We can't leave now.

216
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:01,840
We have to calm down.

217
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:05,840
I... I think you're the right one.

218
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,840
But I don't think I'm the right one.

219
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:09,840
I'm telling you, don't move.

220
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,840
If you move, I'll shoot you.

221
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,840
Wait, wait, listen to me.

222
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,840
I think we should just shoot each other.

223
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,840
Otherwise, I think there could be something else.

224
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:16,840
No.

225
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,840
You're so...

226
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,840
I'm going to kill you.

227
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,840
This idiot.

228
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,840
He's playing for real.

229
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:36,840
I'm reporting.

230
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:40,840
The reason we're looking for is that Mr. Li has already found it.

231
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,840
It shouldn't be a problem.

232
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,840
Oh, my God.

233
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,840
What kind of gun is this?

234
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,840
It's so heavy.

235
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,840
How does it feel to be shot?

236
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,840
You bastard.

237
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,840
You bastard.

238
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:11,840
You're so bad. You gave me the gun now.

239
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,840
I'm going to shoot you, too.

240
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:14,840
You bastard.

241
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:15,840
Have you ever shot?

242
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,840
No.

243
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,840
You haven't?

244
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,840
You haven't shot? You have to change the script.

245
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,840
I'm a close-range sniper.

246
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:28,840
So I'll shoot myself.

247
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,840
Okay, it's about time.

248
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,840
The Japanese should be here.

249
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:43,840
Let's go.

250
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,840
Let's go inside and have a look.

251
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:47,840
You guys stay outside.

252
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,840
Okay.

253
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,840
Not bad.

254
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,840
You two are good at playing.

255
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:06,840
Perfect.

256
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,840
You're right.

257
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,840
You're right.

258
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,840
Wait a minute.

259
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,840
Wait a minute.

260
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,840
See you later.

261
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,840
You bastard.

262
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,840
You guys lie down.

263
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,840
Don't let me get busy for nothing.

264
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,840
Hello.

265
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,840
Let's go.

266
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:03,840
Search inside.

267
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,840
Okay.

268
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,840
Lu.

269
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:23,840
My husband.

270
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,840
My husband.

271
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:33,940
You

272
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:55,680
Hey.

273
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,680
I found him.

274
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,680
No!

275
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,680
Shoot!

276
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,680
Mr. Takeda,

277
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,680
I found the person you wanted.

278
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,680
In order to find Johnson Lee,

279
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,680
I have to kill him.

280
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,680
I found Johnson Lee.

281
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,680
I'm injured.

282
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,680
I even lost so many brothers.

283
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:33,680
I need you to give me a lot of money.

284
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:37,680
I have to give my brothers some money.

285
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,680
Okay?

286
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,680
Charlie is still in the house.

287
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,680
Charlie.

288
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,680
Yes!

289
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,680
There's another one here.

290
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,680
It must be Charlie.

291
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,680
It must be Charlie.

292
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,680
I need to save him.

293
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,680
Go!

294
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,680
Did you check their bodies?

295
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,680
Yes.

296
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,680
Mr. Takeda,

297
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,680
the first-time encounter was too powerful.

298
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,680
But Johnson Lee,

299
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,680
he was too scared to meet him.

300
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,680
He was too scared to meet him.

301
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,680
I'm Charlie.

302
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,680
I'm a good man.

303
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,680
I'm a good man.

304
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,680
I'm a good man.

305
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,680
Did you find him?

306
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,680
I found him.

307
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,680
I found him.

308
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,680
The Chou Jian team beat him to death.

309
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,680
Chief,

310
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,680
I checked,

311
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,680
but the Chou Jian team is in the position.

312
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,680
It seems that this Guancai Pou

313
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,680
is one of the Chou Jian team's bases.

314
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,680
I was not able to

315
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,680
to invite this situation.

316
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,680
I'll give you the money

317
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,680
and give you the money today.

318
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,680
Yes.

319
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,680
Good job.

320
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,680
See you next time.

321
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,680
Bye-bye.

322
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,680
What?

323
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,680
Are you kidding me?

324
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,680
It's fine.

325
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,680
I'll go.

326
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,680
Mr. Lee,

327
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,680
take care.

328
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,680
My name is Ding Yi.

329
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,680
I'm an actor.

330
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,680
I'll give you a role.

331
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,680
What should I do?

332
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,680
That's Wu Tian.

333
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,680
He killed his own people.

334
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,680
You haven't seen him.

335
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,680
Ding Yi!

336
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,680
He's dead!

337
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,680
I've been thinking.

338
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,680
They've been blind.

339
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,680
They're not even alive.

340
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,680
How can you

341
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,680
blind him?

342
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,680
Who are you?

343
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,680
I'm not Li Yue-se.

344
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,680
I'm not...

345
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,680
I'm not Li Yue-se.

346
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,680
I...

347
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,680
I'm not...

348
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,680
I'm not Li Yue-se.

349
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,680
I'm...

350
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,680
You said you're not Li Yue-se.

351
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,680
Then who are you?

352
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,680
I've been thinking.

353
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,680
If next time

354
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,680
I meet Chu Jian-tui again,

355
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,680
I'll say I'm not Li Yue-se.

356
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,680
Then who should I be?

357
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,680
I'm not Li Yue-se.

358
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,680
I'm not Li Yue-se.

359
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,680
Just say you're a member of my troupe.

360
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,680
You're so clumsy.

361
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,680
You're so funny.

362
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,680
Miss Xian...

363
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,680
Miss Xian...

364
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,680
Why are you so careless?

365
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,680
You hurt yourself like this.

366
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,680
Don't worry, Miss Xian.

367
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,680
I'm just acting.

368
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,680
I'm very careful.

369
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,680
I'm not a bad person.

370
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,680
I'm just a good person.

371
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,680
I'm not a bad person.

372
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,680
I'm just a good person.

373
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,680
I'm just a good person.

374
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,680
I'm just a good person.

375
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,680
I'm just a good person.

376
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,680
I'm just a good person.

377
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,680
I'm just a good person.

378
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,680
You're too bold.

379
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,680
Do you know how dangerous the situation is?

380
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,680
Don't think you can just go around

381
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,680
with the relationship of the four great workers.

382
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,680
Wu Tian will confirm the situation

383
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,680
and immediately confirm

384
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,680
whether you mean it or not.

385
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:53,680
This is the second-in-command of the Japanese royal family.

386
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:57,680
He was a representative of the Zhuying embassy in Japan.

387
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,680
He has a very high status.

388
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,680
When he was studying in Europe,

389
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,680
he was a classmate of Li Yue-se's father.

390
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,680
They were very close.

391
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,680
After the four great workers returned to Japan,

392
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,680
he invited Li Yue-se's father and father to Japan many times

393
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,680
to work as his password.

394
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,680
to work as his password.

395
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,680
If that's the case,

396
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,680
is it possible that

397
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,680
they are both

398
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,680
the same father and the same death?

399
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,680
I don't know.

400
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,680
Fortunately, this four great workers

401
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,680
are both the same father and the same death.

402
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,680
But the Japanese people

403
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,680
are used to the same father and the same death.

404
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,680
If he really

405
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,680
recognized Li Yue-se as the same father,

406
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,680
it's not impossible.

407
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,680
It's not.

408
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,680
If it's not

409
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,680
this concern,

410
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,680
you just said

411
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,680
I would call back every five days.

412
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,680
Then I would be exposed.

413
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,680
You are lucky.

414
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,680
The brain was activated

415
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,680
a while ago

416
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,680
before the four great workers in the Eastern Courtyard.

417
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,680
This is not a coincidence.

418
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,680
Then you have to leave Shanghai as soon as possible.

419
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,680
Although you can't confirm

420
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,680
your relationship with the four great workers in the Eastern Courtyard,

421
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,680
the workers will be here soon.

422
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,680
If you don't do this,

423
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,680
you can't hide it at all.

424
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,680
I have figured out a way

425
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,680
to help you get a week's time.

426
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,680
I'm going to the Western Courtyard.

427
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,680
I'll be waiting for you.

428
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,680
I'll be waiting for you.

429
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,680
I'll be waiting for you.

430
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,680
I'll be waiting for you.

431
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,680
I'll be waiting for you.

432
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,680
I'll be waiting for you.

433
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,680
I'll be waiting for you.

434
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,680
I'll be waiting for you.

435
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,680
I'll be waiting for you.

436
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,680
I'll be waiting for you.

437
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,680
I'll be waiting for you.

438
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,680
I'll be waiting for you.

439
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,680
I'll be waiting for you.

440
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,680
I'll be waiting for you.

441
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,680
Hello?

442
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,680
Are you Shanghai Defense Bureau?

443
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,680
Please come to the dock and have a look.

444
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,680
There are a lot of problems here.

445
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,680
It's scary.

446
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,680
Do you care?

447
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,680
Okay, okay. Goodbye.

448
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,680
There's a plague at the dock.

449
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,680
The ship can't stop.

450
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,680
We can only wait outside.

451
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,680
The quarantine check if anyone is infected

452
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,680
takes seven days.

453
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,680
In these seven days,

454
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,680
we'll find a way to send you away.

455
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,680
Seven days?

456
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,680
Enough.

457
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,680
Enough what?

458
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,680
Revenge for Hongyu.

459
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,680
Are you crazy?

460
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,680
Miss Xia, I know Hongyu died for Kan's sake.

461
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,680
So, are you two

462
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,680
Baru?

463
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,680
I know it too.

464
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,680
Your identity

465
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,680
can't be revealed to others.

466
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,680
But it doesn't matter.

467
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,680
I'll join you.

468
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,680
We'll revenge for Hongyu together.

469
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,680
What do you think?

470
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,680
If you just want to revenge,

471
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,680
I'm so sorry for Hongyu's sacrifice.

472
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,680
I'm sorry for Hongyu's sacrifice.

473
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,680
Hongyu saved you.

474
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,680
I'll kill you.

475
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,680
But...

476
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,680
Hongyu is your own man.

477
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,680
You're not my own man.

478
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,680
You never care about me.

479
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,680
You're dead too.

480
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,680
You can't revenge.

481
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,680
My sister died for nothing.

482
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,680
She died for nothing.

483
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,680
I know the same thing.

484
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,680
If I can fight against Japan

485
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,680
with my hand,

486
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,680
I'll be the first to go.

487
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,680
But this meaningless sacrifice

488
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,680
is not for you.

489
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,680
If you think so,

490
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,680
I won't leave you.

491
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,680
One, two, three!

492
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,680
Hongyu

493
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,680
Hongyu

494
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,680
At the meeting yesterday,

495
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,680
the Greek secret code was leaked.

496
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,680
The Navy laughed at it.

497
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,680
The guy from the army

498
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,680
can't be the one to do the job.

499
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,680
Even if we have a little bit of a problem,

500
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,680
we don't have the means to be told off.

501
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,680
As long as we catch the person who leaked the code,

502
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,680
no matter what anyone says,

503
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,680
we have nothing to say back.

504
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,680
I'm not saying that

505
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,680
the producer and the producer are the same.

506
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,680
I've always doubted

507
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,680
that they had a problem.

508
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,680
I think there was a problem

509
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,680
inside the ship.

510
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,680
What do you mean?

511
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,680
If you think it's suspicious,

512
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,680
investigate thoroughly

513
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,680
and get the results as soon as possible.

514
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,680
Once the Duke of Saionji wakes up

515
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,680
and the details of the number of the D.U.S.

516
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,680
are confirmed,

517
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,680
even if he really leaked the code,

518
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,680
we can't do anything about it.

519
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,680
Do you understand?

520
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,680
What's the truth?

521
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,680
We can't leave the person

522
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,680
who leaked the code

523
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,680
inside the ship.

524
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,680
What do you mean?

525
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,680
Mr. Li is blind.

526
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,680
He can't see.

527
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,680
I have to take care of him.

528
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:15,680
Our people are taking care of Mr. Li.

529
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,680
Your people?

530
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:21,680
Can your people be like me?

531
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:23,680
I'm the one who takes care of Mr. Li.

532
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:25,680
Can your people take care of him?

533
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:27,680
I must take care of Mr. Li today.

534
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:33,680
I'm going to complain to the Chief of the Fifth Heaven.

535
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:37,680
Where are you?

536
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:41,680
Mr. Li!

537
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,680
Mr. Li!

538
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:45,680
Mr. Li!

539
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:47,680
You said someone was taking care of him, right?

540
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,680
You said someone was taking care of...

541
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:51,680
Mr. Li!

542
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:53,680
Mr. Li!

543
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:55,680
Let him go!

544
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:57,680
Is it me?

545
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,680
It's you, right?

546
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,680
Great!

547
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,680
You're still alive!

548
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,680
It's great!

549
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,680
I'm here to pray for you.

550
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,680
Great!

551
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,680
I'll help you up.

552
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,680
I thought you were dead.

553
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,680
Mr. Gu!

554
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,680
You can't leave!

555
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,680
You must go back to your ward!

556
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,680
Charlie is my eyes!

557
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,680
Why did you separate us?

558
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,680
Even if he goes to the bathroom,

559
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,680
he has to be in my room!

560
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,680
Arrange him in my ward right now!

561
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,680
Right now!

562
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,680
Right now!

563
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,680
Right now!

564
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,680
***

565
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:40,600
I must send you away before the Japanese come.

566
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,600
Anyway,

567
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,680
within these seven days,

568
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,600
I must kill Wu Tian.

569
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,600
Lin Ye, I want to kill too.

570
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,600
I want to kill all the Japanese.

571
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,720
But in this situation,

572
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,680
we can't go into the mountains and kill them.

573
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:00,600
Then I'll poison myself.

574
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,680
I'll complete the assassination operation for you.

575
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,600
You kill Wu Tian for me.

576
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:06,680
We cooperate.

577
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:07,680
Are you kidding me?

578
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:11,600
The most important thing for you now is to leave here and keep yourself safe.

579
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,600
You have a chance to take revenge when you are safe.

580
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,600
I've helped you so much.

581
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,600
Can't you help me once?

582
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:17,600
No.

583
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,600
If you don't help me, I'll get you out of here.

584
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,600
What did you say?

585
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:29,600
You...

586
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:32,600
Who is it?

587
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,600
Mr. Li, this is the Japanese.

588
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:37,680
Why is Lin here?

589
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,600
I guess he's here to inform you about the check-up.

590
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,600
Captain Lin.

591
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,600
Is that Captain Lin?

592
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:59,600
Lisa.

593
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,600
Gong Meiyu is here too?

594
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:04,600
Did Mr. Miyamoto come?

595
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,600
I've been waiting for you for so long.

596
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:07,600
My eyes.

597
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,600
My eyes are saved.

598
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,600
Now my eyes will be saved.

599
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:15,600
Lisa, there's a mistake.

600
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,600
You're looking for the wrong person.

601
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:22,600
Where is Gong Meiyu?

602
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,600
Where is Mr. Miyamoto?

603
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:25,600
He hasn't arrived yet.

604
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:27,600
He hasn't arrived yet.

605
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,600
He hasn't arrived yet?

606
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:32,600
But Captain Lin said that Gong Meiyu will arrive today.

607
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:33,600
He said he would arrive tomorrow.

608
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:38,600
Mr. Miyamoto's ship is still unable to enter the harbor.

609
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,600
Why?

610
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:42,600
Lisa.

611
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,600
We just received the information from the Kyoto office.

612
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:46,600
We just received the information from the Kyoto office.

613
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:47,600
We are very sorry.

614
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:48,600
We are very sorry to inform you.

615
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:52,600
The harbor is suspected of the occurrence of the Trin influenza.

616
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:56,600
We have to wait on the ship until we can confirm the safety.

617
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,600
The temperature?

618
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,600
How long will it take to arrive?

619
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:08,600
It will take seven days.

620
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:10,600
Seven days?

621
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:13,600
Are you talking nonsense?

622
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,600
You told me that Gong Meiyu was busy.

623
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,600
That's fine.

624
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,600
But he's already arrived.

625
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,600
Why didn't you let him come to see me?

626
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,600
Tell me.

627
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,600
Do you have any other conditions?

628
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,600
Mr. Li, calm down.

629
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,600
We're not trying to deceive you.

630
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:31,600
It's not that we don't trust you.

631
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,600
In fact, there is a disease in the harbor.

632
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:39,600
So I don't think anyone is intentionally hindering the activities of the Imperial Army.

633
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:42,600
We suspect that someone is deliberately blocking the return of the troops.

634
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,600
Chief Takeda is already heading for the chief.

635
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,600
The navy is also investigating.

636
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,600
It's also a matter of time before the results come out.

637
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,600
Chief Wuding has already rushed to deal with it.

638
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:52,600
The navy is also...

639
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:03,600
Anyway, we have to wait for now.

640
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,600
Anyway, Mr. Jin Di, please wait patiently.

641
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:09,600
Tomorrow, I will definitely bring Mr. Miyamoto.

642
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:12,600
Tomorrow, we will definitely invite Dr. Miyamoto back.

643
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,600
Tomorrow?

644
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,600
Then, I'll take my leave.

645
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:19,600
It's not too late.

646
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,600
Why did it suddenly turn into tomorrow?

647
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,600
It's impossible.

648
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,600
Impossible?

649
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:39,600
I'm talking to you.

650
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:45,600
The Japanese Army and the navy have always been divided by their strategic atmosphere.

651
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:48,600
But Wuding is a mere chief of the military.

652
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,600
How can he move the navy?

653
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:52,600
What do you mean?

654
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:54,600
Xiaolin just made a promise.

655
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,600
He said that he would be back tomorrow.

656
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:59,600
Xiaolin just made a promise.

657
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:01,600
He said that Wuding had moved the navy.

658
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:04,600
When he was translating, he suddenly responded.

659
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:05,600
He stopped.

660
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,600
He doesn't want us to know.

661
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,600
We don't have time to worry about this now.

662
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,600
You have to tell Miss Xian quickly.

663
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:15,600
The eyes are being checked until tomorrow.

664
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,600
We have to find a way to deal with it.

665
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,600
I can't reveal it now.

666
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,600
I understand.

667
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:29,600
I sent someone to the shipyard in the port.

668
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:32,600
I can't guarantee it until tomorrow.

669
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:37,600
Even if it's late, I'll be sure to report it on the day after tomorrow.

670
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,600
Brother, thank you very much.

671
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:46,600
Look, I told you not to do that outside.

672
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:49,600
I'm sorry, Colonel Kumamoto.

673
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:52,600
I'm sorry.

674
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:03,600
Write it down.

675
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:13,600
This is the new record you requested.

676
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:18,600
It's a copy of the English copy.

677
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,600
It's dangerous.

678
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:24,600
Don't tell anyone about this.

679
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:29,600
I'm sorry for the trouble I caused you.

680
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:34,600
If you have time, don't come to me.

681
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:40,600
Don't you dare to force me to do this.

682
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:43,600
Yes.

683
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:52,600
I'm sorry.
