00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:24,080
In

00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:31,080
Summer's Flames

3
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:41,580
Season 3 grave notch

4
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:44,580
In the year 1940

5
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:47,540
the Anti-Japanese War took place at the cross-country stage.

6
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:50,780
Air-bombs were Ichğit clients on the open field.

7
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:54,020
There was always light and 귀여lling on theakap knittingバー Lat棋 Line.

8
00:01:54,080 --> 00:02:00,080
Here, the point and the horizontal of the horse has become a knife and a gun.

9
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:06,080
And for the code system of these horses, it has become a shield and a wall.

10
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:11,080
The latter uses the infinite wave to attack the enemy in the air.

11
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:14,080
The enemy's wall is getting heavier and higher.

12
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:19,080
Our breakers are getting closer and closer.

13
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:28,080
Court of Judicial Review

14
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:44,080
Five lures

15
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:52,080
Then our net is created.

16
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:58,080
The algorithm we are introducing here can be seen as a symmetric algorithm.

17
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:04,080
The principle is to use seed secretion and secretion-generated function to generate secretion flow.

18
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,080
Using the rules of one-time pad to encrypt.

19
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:19,080
Excuse me, can I ask you to repeat that word?

20
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:24,080
I've been studying the environment for many years. I don't think I can get in.

21
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,080
Blackbird.

22
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,080
Blackbird.

23
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,080
One-time pad.

24
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:54,080
I can understand the method of one-time pad.

25
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,080
Is that so?

26
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,080
Yes, Mr. Li Yuecao.

27
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:05,080
The Golden Wolf of the Art of Gold has the same blood-sucking experience as you.

28
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:12,080
It's just that it's not a great honor to play the Niujing School of the Blackbird.

29
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,080
Niujing School of the Blackbird.

30
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:25,080
But why is the secretion of secretion-generated function fixed on these numbers?

31
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,080
You have too many questions.

32
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,080
Think about it again.

33
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,080
I can't think of anything.

34
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,080
Please explain.

35
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,080
Oh my god.

36
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,080
I'm giving you a lesson.

37
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,080
It's just wasting my time.

38
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,080
Your time is up.

39
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,080
Unfortunately, that's all for today's lesson.

40
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:11,080
I hope you can do more homework next time.

41
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,080
Mr. Li.

42
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,080
Mr. Li.

43
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,080
Wait a minute.

44
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,080
What?

45
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,080
What else is going on with the Wutian Section?

46
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,080
You forgot something.

47
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:02,080
Mr. Li, this is the double revenge.

48
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,080
I hope you can't get away with it.

49
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,080
I hope you can stop Mr. Li.

50
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,080
Please take it.

51
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,080
Today's Wutian Section is really different.

52
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:23,080
According to your approach, I will take people to the main gate to take a deep breath.

53
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:29,080
Next time when we have a lesson, I hope you can respect my time and math.

54
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,080
Let's go.

55
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:39,080
Mr. Li didn't reveal the whole secret of the design.

56
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:44,080
But why did you trust him so much?

57
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,080
Mr. Li, please.

58
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:59,080
I'm going to use the method he gave us to strengthen the code.

59
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:07,080
We were able to get through the Chinese army's investigation in a way that strengthened the code he provided us.

60
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,080
Mr. Li, please.

61
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,080
Thanks.

62
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:30,080
The Chinese army will be destroyed in a few days.

63
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:42,080
Even if we get through that, we will still be able to get the money.

64
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:59,080
I'm going to use the method he gave us to strengthen the code.

65
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,080
I can't see it.

66
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:22,080
I can't see it.

67
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,080
Here.

68
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,080
Mr. Yuse, this is the reward for today.

69
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,080
Mr. Yuse, see you next class.

70
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,080
Wait.

71
00:09:54,080 --> 00:10:01,080
The material I gave you this time has been specially saved.

72
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:06,080
If you publish a book today, someone will definitely raise questions.

73
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,080
And you can't answer.

74
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:12,080
I'm sure the Japanese will think you are not satisfied with the revenge.

75
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:15,080
So I must have given you more money.

76
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,080
You are deliberately.

77
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,080
Do you know that I almost missed today?

78
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,080
Fortunately, I reacted quickly.

79
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:23,080
Otherwise, our business would have been ruined.

80
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,080
How much did they give you?

81
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,080
A double.

82
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:33,080
You are so useless.

83
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:43,080
If it weren't for making some money, I wouldn't have given you a lot of money.

84
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,080
I'll give you more.

85
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,080
I'll give you more.

86
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:50,080
Since the Japanese are willing to pay you double the revenge,

87
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:59,080
this will prove that the enemy is now helpless against my code system.

88
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,080
But this is unreasonable.

89
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:07,080
How could his reaction be so slow?

90
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,080
Who?

91
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,080
It's just a game.

92
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,080
It has nothing to do with you.

93
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,080
You are so annoying.

94
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,080
I'm sorry.

95
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,080
Let's have an apple today.

96
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,080
Let's go.

97
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,080
Excuse me.

98
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,080
At nine o'clock last night,

99
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:29,080
the traitor was killed by the Japanese in the Meizhen Road Hotel in Hubei Road, Sima Road.

100
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,080
Excuse me.

101
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,080
At nine o'clock last night,

102
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:37,080
the traitor was killed by the Japanese in the Meizhen Road Hotel in Hubei Road, Sima Road.

103
00:12:44,080 --> 00:13:11,080
Mr. Li, I just thought about it for a while.

104
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,080
I don't think the company's distribution is very reasonable.

105
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,080
Let me tell you.

106
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:19,080
Before, we used to get one bill for each.

107
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,080
But today, they ordered two.

108
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,080
Should I get two?

109
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,080
I'll give you.

110
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:40,080
Why didn't anyone open the door?

111
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,080
I fell asleep.

112
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,080
It's okay.

113
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,080
It's too hard to work.

114
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:52,080
Then I'll leave you alone.

115
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,080
Mr. Li.

116
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,080
Mr. Li.

117
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,080
Mr. Li.

118
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,080
Mr. Li.

119
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:17,080
When did you get a blood pressure?

120
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:21,080
Your footsteps are not as fast as before.

121
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,080
I don't think so.

122
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:46,080
Is it necessary to treat an invisible person like this?

123
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:53,080
I don't want to be disturbed by outsiders in our future meeting.

124
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,080
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

125
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,080
Guiyang Mountain.

126
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,080
Old friend.

127
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,080
Long time no see.

128
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:27,060
You designed the new password of the

129
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:28,080
mech, right?

130
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,080
Why do you think it's me?

131
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:33,080
The new password is using the six-password.

132
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:36,080
People who master this kind of computing method are no longer in the world.

133
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,080
And when you go to college,

134
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:41,080
the direction of your research is the one-off computing.

135
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:44,080
My intelligence tells me that the new password of the mech

136
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,080
was designed by a genius mathematician.

137
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,080
I guessed it was you at that time.

138
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,080
That's right.

139
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,080
You really didn't let me down.

140
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,080
How about it?

141
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,080
Can't you figure it out?

142
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,080
Which step is it?

143
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,080
Tell me.

144
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,080
Let me hear it.

145
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:09,080
Do you know how many people die under your password every day

146
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:11,080
in the front line of Subei?

147
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:15,080
You just tell me which step you've reached now.

148
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:23,080
So you think the life of a person is more important than the math, right?

149
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:27,080
The problem of math, you should have told the math.

150
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:32,080
Not to come here and take some irrelevant lives to kidnap me.

151
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,080
You owe me all this.

152
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,080
This is the battlefield between you and me.

153
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,080
I just want to see you be invincible and face defeat.

154
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:45,080
I want to count all the lives of Song'er on your head.

155
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,080
Okay, let's finish the story.

156
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,080
Back to the military, there are a hundred ways.

157
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,080
Then you tell me.

158
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:00,080
Kunyangshan, you've changed.

159
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,080
Don't forget that you are a mathematician.

160
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:08,080
Now you actually have to use the military's method to deal with me.

161
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,080
Come on, old classmate.

162
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:17,080
Let's be polite and walk out.

163
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,080
Okay.

164
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,080
Mr. Li.

165
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,080
Li.

166
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,080
Why are you doing this?

167
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,080
I'm sure you've been through it.

168
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:51,080
Before, it was one card for one card.

169
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:53,080
But today, they gave two cards.

170
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:55,080
Should I just draw two cards?

171
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,080
I'll give you.

172
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,080
Brother, I'm just a passerby.

173
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,080
But now you're in the game.

174
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,080
Come on, stand up.

175
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,080
Stand up and talk.

176
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,080
No, I'm comfortable on my knees.

177
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,080
Interesting.

178
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,080
Who are you?

179
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,080
I'm not Lue Se.

180
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,080
Of course I know you're not Lue Se.

181
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,080
I'm asking you.

182
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,080
Who are you?

183
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,080
My name is Ding Yi.

184
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,080
I'm an actor.

185
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,080
Actor?

186
00:19:36,080 --> 00:20:00,900
Brother, are you from the

187
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,080
Chinese Academy of Medicine?

188
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,080
I'm from the Chinese Academy of Medicine.

189
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,080
I didn't get the antidote in six hours.

190
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,080
You're dead.

191
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:11,080
I'm paralyzed in the middle of the book.

192
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,080
I'm dying.

193
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,080
Brother.

194
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,080
Brother.

195
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,080
Don't kneel down.

196
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,080
No, I'm too weak.

197
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,080
Brother, aren't you from the police?

198
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,080
Isn't the police not good people?

199
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,080
Yes, they are.

200
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:29,080
But I don't know if you're a good person.

201
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:33,080
You're a good person because you helped me.

202
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,080
Brother.

203
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,080
We don't have two med Für quarter.

204
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,080
Come with me later.

205
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,080
об��

206
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,080
Here you go.

207
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,080
Okay.

208
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,080
Where are you taking me?

209
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,080
Why are they here?

210
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,080
Wu Tian told me in the afternoon

211
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,080
that he was taking Jin Tang to my father's funeral.

212
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:21,080
I didn't expect him to be here so soon.

213
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,080
Just do your job.

214
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,080
It's like a movie today.

215
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,080
It's too exciting.

216
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,080
I'm getting a headache.

217
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,080
Keep working on it.

218
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,080
Please.

219
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,080
Don't talk.

220
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,080
Otherwise, we'll all die.

221
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,080
Mr. Yi.

222
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,080
It's Wu Tian?

223
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:49,080
This is Yao Jin.

224
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,080
Wu Tian.

225
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,080
Why are you here?

226
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,080
I told you just now

227
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,080
that I was taking Jin Tang

228
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,080
to your father's funeral.

229
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,080
You forgot?

230
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,080
I'm sorry.

231
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:03,080
I was wrong about what happened in the classroom.

232
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:05,080
I'm really sorry.

233
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,080
Young people can understand.

234
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,080
But you have to remember

235
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:17,080
to keep the things you don't understand in mind.

236
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,080
Otherwise,

237
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:21,080
no one will know how stupid you are.

238
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,080
You're going out?

239
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,080
What?

240
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,080
Wu Tian.

241
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:38,080
Are you going to report my whereabouts?

242
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,080
Mr. Yi.

243
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:44,080
I'm just worried that you're not at ease.

244
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,080
Where are you going?

245
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:47,080
I'll send someone to send you.

246
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,080
No need.

247
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,080
There's a car outside.

248
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,080
Wait.

249
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,080
I'll take you to the hospital.

250
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,080
Where are you going?

251
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,080
What are you doing there?

252
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,080
Help me carry it.

253
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,080
Yes.

254
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,080
Charlie.

255
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,080
How can you let someone

256
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,080
help us take the luggage?

257
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,080
Don't you know your place?

258
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,080
Don't you have hands?

259
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,080
I'm sorry, Wu Tian.

260
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,080
I'm sorry to make you laugh.

261
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:30,080
My assistant just came back from England.

262
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,080
Maybe he hasn't arrived yet.

263
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:36,080
So his head is a little dizzy.

264
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,080
Sorry, sir.

265
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,080
Hello.

266
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:45,080
I'm Charlie.

267
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,080
Nice to meet you.

268
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,080
I'm back.

269
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:53,080
You're back.

270
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:57,080
You're great.

271
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,080
What are you doing here?

272
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,080
We're not in a hurry.

273
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:06,080
Mr. Yi.

274
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,080
Brother, slow down.

275
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,080
You can't see anything in the green.

276
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,080
Have you forgotten?

277
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,080
I'm sorry.

278
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,080
The blue car on the right.

279
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,080
Brother, I can help you here.

280
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,080
It's already good.

281
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,080
Give me the antidote.

282
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:25,080
I'll find a place where there's no one.

283
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,080
Don't worry about me.

284
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,080
I can do it.

285
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:29,080
No, get in the car.

286
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,080
I'm your boss.

287
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,080
This is the record of the number of people

288
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,080
who have been killed in the last two days.

289
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,080
This is the record of the number of people

290
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,080
who have been killed in the last two days.

291
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:51,080
Check if that girl is really there.

292
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:55,080
Brother, you're so kind.

293
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:57,080
You should come to our troupe as an actor.

294
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,080
How about this?

295
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,080
Give me the antidote first.

296
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,080
I have to act when I get back.

297
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,080
I have a lot of time every day.

298
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,080
I'm sorry.

299
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:25,080
I'm sorry.

300
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,080
Brother, what are you doing?

301
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,080
Can't you just stay with me?

302
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:47,080
Isn't that Lin?

303
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:49,080
She's been following us.

304
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,080
You should be more serious.

305
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,080
What's wrong?

306
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,080
What's wrong?

307
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,080
What's wrong?

308
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:45,080
What's going on?

309
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:47,080
Help me.

310
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,080
Help me get them out of here.

311
00:26:49,080 --> 00:27:12,080
I'll give you the money for the

312
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,080
money.

313
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,080
Hurry up.

314
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,080
What is this place?

315
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:35,080
It's the prop warehouse of the Chaozhong Group.

316
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:37,080
There's a live performance ahead.

317
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,080
Don't worry, no one will come.

318
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:41,080
Don't worry.

319
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,080
Hurry up, everyone.

320
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,080
The first scene is about to end.

321
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,080
You guys go over there and move the props.

322
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,080
Hurry up.

323
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,080
Hurry up.

324
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,080
Wait, wait, wait.

325
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:14,080
It's impossible to go over that wall with that trunk.

326
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:21,080
Damn it.

327
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,080
You're acting every day.

328
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:27,080
How can you make such a mistake?

329
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,080
Someone will come later.

330
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:31,080
It's a sudden situation.

331
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:33,080
Hurry up and find it.

332
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:35,080
Go over there and take a look.

333
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:43,080
Hurry up.

334
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:50,080
Hurry up.

335
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,080
Miss, we found it.

336
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,080
It must be the mud ball.

337
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,080
You put it here.

338
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,080
Kondo.

339
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:22,080
Shida.

340
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,080
Here too.

341
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,080
Don't act on your own.

342
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,080
It might be inside.

343
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,080
This is the public area.

344
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,080
We can't act on our own.

345
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,080
Let's wait for Chief Takeda.

346
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,080
Yes.

347
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,080
Taka.

348
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,080
Kan-

349
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,080
Shota.

350
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,080
Don't leave anything behind.

351
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,080
It might be inside.

352
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,080
This is the public area.

353
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,080
We can't act on our own.

354
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,080
Let's wait for Chief Takeda.

355
00:29:48,080 --> 00:30:02,680
Wife?

356
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:05,680
Brother, look what I said.

357
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:12,680
I said, they just come in and take the knife.

358
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:15,680
They won't find us.

359
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:22,680
Open it.

360
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,680
I...

361
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,680
Open it.

362
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,680
Huh?

363
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,680
Yue Ze.

364
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:46,680
To cut a long story short, I'm not here to cause you trouble.

365
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:49,680
I'm here to send you an invitation.

366
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:54,680
I hope you can come to us without any evidence.

367
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:58,680
I don't know where I've offended you.

368
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,680
But now, the country is in danger.

369
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:03,680
It's not up to them.

370
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:06,680
You, come with me.

371
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:10,680
You can tell us what you want.

372
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,680
Right.

373
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,680
Look, brother.

374
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,680
How long have you been here?

375
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:19,680
I told you to open whatever you want.

376
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,680
You mean, you can do whatever you want.

377
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,680
Brother.

378
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,680
I don't want anything.

379
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:29,680
All I want in my life

380
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:33,680
is to defeat you.

381
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,940
You are a

382
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:41,680
stubborn child.

383
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,680
The second year of coming to the cattle army,

384
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:47,680
you broke my hard-earned money

385
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,680
and built a encrypted model.

386
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,680
The International Mathematic Association also

387
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,680
took back the invitation to me.

388
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,680
You were so famous

389
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:00,680
but I was defeated.

390
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:07,680
I fell into the mud from the clouds.

391
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:13,680
Later, I built a dark basement

392
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,680
to defeat you.

393
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:16,680
I didn't have a day or night.

394
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:20,680
I just wanted to create a way to defeat you.

395
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:24,680
But unfortunately, I fell into the mud.

396
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:28,680
He crushed my body.

397
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:32,680
Now, I still remember that day.

398
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,680
When I was on the table,

399
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,680
writing the last number,

400
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,680
I became a ugly blind man

401
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:42,680
in the eyes of others.

402
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:45,680
Although I can't see anything now,

403
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:48,680
my eyes will be red.

404
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,680
If you get the invitation

405
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,680
from them,

406
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:59,680
you will be as ugly as a ghost.

407
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,680
I'm sorry.

408
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,680
I really don't know what you said.

409
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,680
But if it's because of this,

410
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,680
I apologize to you.

411
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,680
Look.

412
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,680
Look.

413
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,680
This is the place you don't want to cry.

414
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:24,680
But I risked my life to go there.

415
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:28,680
So I only want to be your enemy in this life.

416
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:30,680
I don't care who I serve.

417
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,680
I'll die if I can't.

418
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:33,680
But even if I die,

419
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,680
I want to be your dream forever.

420
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,680
I want you to never break my code.

421
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,680
In this life,

422
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:41,680
open your eyes and close your eyes.

423
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:44,680
It's all because of this code.

424
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,680
The ghost of death.

425
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,680
Do you want to know the secret?

426
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:57,680
Then we'll solve it in the hell.

427
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:10,680
You can't die.

428
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:12,680
If you die,

429
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:13,680
I'll be a traitor.

430
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:15,680
I'll kill you.

431
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,680
Take off your dirty hands.

432
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:37,640
You smelly

433
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:40,640
It's you again.

434
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:47,640
You are...

435
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:51,640
Brother, let go.

436
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:53,640
Brother, don't shoot.

437
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:54,640
This is our boss.

438
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:55,640
He is also an actor.

439
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:56,640
A big star.

440
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,640
You must know about the county police.

441
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,640
Don't shoot.

442
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:02,640
Think about it.

443
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,640
I took a private job.

444
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,640
We are rehearsing.

445
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:07,640
Rehearsal.

446
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:09,640
This is fake.

447
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:10,640
It's a prop.

448
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,640
It's not real.

449
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,640
It seems that the country is small.

450
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:17,640
You are the main character.

451
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:26,640
What are you doing?

452
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:30,640
You are crazy.

453
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:31,640
What are you doing?

454
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:32,640
Miss Shen, you go over there.

455
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:37,640
You go over there.

456
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:07,640
Don't shoot.

457
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:08,640
Don't shoot.

458
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:14,640
You can't die.

459
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,640
You can't die.

460
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:19,640
What did you say?

461
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:21,640
I...

462
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:27,640
I will teach you how to be a traitor.

463
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:33,640
I'll teach you how to be a traitor.

464
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:37,640
Traitor.

465
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:09,640
Boss, this way.

466
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:24,640
Miss Shen.

467
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:25,640
Miss Shen.

468
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:38,640
Ding Yi.

469
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:40,640
Ding Yi.

470
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:41,640
What are you doing?

471
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:43,640
Miss Shen, they...

472
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:47,640
Miss Shen.

473
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:49,640
There are a group of people outside.

474
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:51,640
It seems to be Japanese.

475
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:53,640
They have entered the theater.

476
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,640
How is the situation on the stage?

477
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,640
The first stage is almost over.

478
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:03,640
Then they...

479
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:05,640
This...

480
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:07,640
This...

481
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:13,640
Although I don't know who you are,

482
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,640
I will never let you

483
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,640
ruin my group's stage.

484
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:41,640
The End

485
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:48,640
Hurry up.

486
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:49,640
Change the stage.

487
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:50,640
Hurry up.

488
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:51,640
Hurry up.

489
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:53,640
Hurry up.

490
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:54,640
Don't be hasty.

491
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:57,640
Be careful.

492
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:00,640
Everyone.

493
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:02,640
This is the backstage.

494
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,640
You can't enter.

495
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:05,640
What are you doing?

496
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:09,640
I told you, you can't enter.

497
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,640
Miss Shen Bing.

498
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:17,640
My name is Wu Tian.

499
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:21,640
I work for the Republic of Dali.

500
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,640
I just heard about your name

501
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,640
when I came to Shanghai.

502
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:33,640
Mr. Wu Tian.

503
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:35,640
You're wrong.

504
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,640
Please go to the front stage.

505
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:39,640
Your presence here

506
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:40,640
will affect our work.

507
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:45,640
Why do you think I'm here to watch the play?

508
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:49,640
I'm here to find someone.

509
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:51,640
Find someone?

510
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,640
I just called the board of directors

511
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:57,640
of the Ministry of Public Affairs.

512
00:39:58,640 --> 00:39:59,640
This is the public building.

513
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:01,640
There are many people he knows.

514
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:05,640
How about I ask him for you?

515
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:08,640
It's okay.

516
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:12,640
Shen Bing can't be the director of the Ministry of Public Affairs.

517
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:14,640
I'll find him.

518
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:16,640
I'll find him.

519
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:20,640
Slow down.

520
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:21,640
Slow down.

521
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:27,640
Come on.

522
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:28,640
Make way.

523
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,640
Be careful, Mr. Wu Tian.

524
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:32,640
Be careful.

525
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:37,640
Be careful.

526
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:01,640
Mr. Wu Tian.

527
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:03,640
The play is about to start.

528
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:04,640
Let's go.

529
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:08,640
Miss Shen.

530
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,640
Aren't you going to the play today?

531
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:13,640
I have to accompany you.

532
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:19,640
Please.

533
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,640
Please investigate the site.

534
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:29,640
Okay.

535
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:30,640
Let's go.

536
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:31,640
Yes.

537
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:32,640
Mr. Wu.

538
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:33,640
Mr. Wu.

539
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:34,640
The play is about to start.

540
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:35,640
Go away.

541
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:38,640
Go away.

542
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:48,640
Where are you going?

543
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,640
We are going to the stage.

544
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,640
There is a strange person.

545
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:57,640
Search twice.

546
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:58,640
Yes.

547
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:02,640
Okay.

548
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:03,640
It's okay.

549
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:05,640
Hold on.

550
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:08,640
Okay.

551
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:17,640
Be careful.

552
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:37,640
Mr. Wu Tian.

553
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:38,640
This way, please.

554
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:42,640
Please sit.

555
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,640
They are all my old friends from the Ministry of Public Affairs.
