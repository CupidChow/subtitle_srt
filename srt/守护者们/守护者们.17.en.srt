The Long Ballad

00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Episode 18

4
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Dr. Mo, be careful.

5
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Give me the medicine.

6
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
How is Mr. Li?

7
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Mr. Li is not optimistic.

8
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
He has taken all the medicine.

9
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
But he still has a headache.

10
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Please help him.

11
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Okay.

12
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
This way, please.

13
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Please.

14
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Coming.

15
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Dr. Mo.

16
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
A Yin,

17
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
we'd better not go up.

18
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Let Charlie help Dr. Mo.

19
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
You're so sharp.

20
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Don't disturb them.

21
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Turn right.

22
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Let's take a break.

23
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Okay.

24
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Don't worry.

25
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
The doctor is here.

26
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
He left suddenly.

27
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Please check if Mr. Li is okay.

28
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Mr. Li.

29
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
We meet again.

30
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Oh my god.

31
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Oh my god.

32
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Miss Long,

33
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I'm sorry to call you here.

34
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I just want to ask you a favor.

35
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Why are there so many people here?

36
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
What happened?

37
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
So many people here.

38
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
So lively.

39
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
What's the situation of Mr. Liang?

40
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Mr. Li.

41
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
It's late.

42
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Why don't you go back first?

43
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I have something to do here.

44
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Don't worry, Mrs. Liang.

45
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I'll see if there's anything that can help you.

46
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Charlie.

47
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Charlie.

48
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Mr. Li and I were caught by the police.

49
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
It's all because of Mr. Li.

50
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
He's a good man.

51
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Mr. Li often mentioned you as a savior.

52
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Li Boyang and Mr. Li.

53
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I don't think so.

54
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
So you're Mr. Li.

55
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I heard about the past from Joseph.

56
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Thank you for saving Mr. Li.

57
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Mr. Li,

58
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
you're not a good man.

59
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I'm sorry.

60
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
It's rare for Mr. Li to remember.

61
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I thought he forgot me after he was in the wrong.

62
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I know you.

63
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Miss Xian,

64
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
you're a big star.

65
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Charlie.

66
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Madam.

67
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
How is Mr. Zhao?

68
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Madam, don't worry.

69
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
It's good that Dr. Meng came in time

70
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
to stabilize Mr. Li's condition.

71
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I'm afraid everyone is too worried.

72
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
So I went downstairs to tell everyone that he's safe.

73
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
It's okay.

74
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Thank you, thank you.

75
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
It's good that he's okay.

76
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Yu Yan,

77
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
the doctor said he's okay.

78
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Don't worry.

79
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Since Mr. Li is okay,

80
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I'm relieved too.

81
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Then we'll go back first.

82
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Wait a minute, experts.

83
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I brought you some cigarettes today.

84
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Let's have a try.

85
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
This is Marble from London.

86
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
It's a genuine British product.

87
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Since the war,

88
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
the cigarettes in Shanghai are almost sold out.

89
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I've spent a lot of money to get a batch.

90
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Experts,

91
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
have a try.

92
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
It's not easy to get this kind of cigarettes now.

93
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Because you can't buy it with money.

94
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Come on, have a try.

95
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
As the saying goes,

96
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
a man doesn't smoke,

97
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
but he's a white man.

98
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
A woman doesn't smoke,

99
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
but she's a white man.

100
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Right?

101
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Everyone, have a try.

102
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Come on.

103
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Let's share.

104
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
This cigarette smells so good.

105
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
If you think my cigarettes are good,

106
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I'll give you five cigarettes

107
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
for your face.

108
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
You're so kind.

109
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Mr. Li, have a try.

110
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I don't smoke.

111
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
You don't smoke?

112
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
It's okay.

113
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You don't smoke, don't worry.

114
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I have other products.

115
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
There are many kinds.

116
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
There are many kinds.

117
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Like artificial silk,

118
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
cloth,

119
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
sugar,

120
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
silk socks, lipstick,

121
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
perfume, can, chocolate.

122
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
And also...

123
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Fire-fighting chicken.

124
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
There are also snowman, red wine, whiskey.

125
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Everything.

126
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Medicines.

127
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Guns.

128
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
And a high-end high-end product that makes you happy.

129
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
If I can go out,

130
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I want her to have a good time.

131
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Mrs. Yang, you two.

132
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
It's almost done.

133
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Let's set up the place.

134
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Okay.

135
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Okay.

136
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Thank you.

137
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Thank you, Mr. Li.

138
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Wait a minute.

139
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
What's wrong with you?

140
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
You are the one in my sister's room, right?

141
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
You and Huang Yu

142
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
help me do something.

143
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I'm sorry.

144
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Mrs. Yang, do you want to try?

145
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I'm sorry.

146
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
How's it going?

147
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
What do you think?

148
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
You're not going to do it.

149
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
You're not going to do it.

150
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Mr. Li.

151
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
It's getting late.

152
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
You should go.

153
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Did you see that?

154
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Mr. Liang said Yan was good.

155
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Well, I won't bother you.

156
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
To be honest,

157
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Mr. Zhou performed the performance of

158
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
The King of the Golden Chord last night.

159
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
It's beautiful.

160
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Then I'll go.

161
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I wish everybody have a wonderful day.

162
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
See you next time.

163
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Mr. Li.

164
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I'll see you out.

165
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Okay.

166
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Please.

167
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
What's wrong with Mr. Li?

168
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Is he okay?

169
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
He's fine now.

170
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Let's move away

171
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
and let Mr. Li come over.

172
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Okay.

173
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Goodbye.

174
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Mr. Li, turn right.

175
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Okay.

176
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Bye.

177
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Mr. Li, see you.

178
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
See you.

179
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
See you, Mr. Li.

180
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
See you, Mr. Li.

181
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Mr. Li, see you.

182
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Mr. Li.

183
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I'll see you out.

184
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Mr. Li, turn right.

185
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Okay.

186
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Don't laugh.

187
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Is it really that hard?

188
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Hurry up.

189
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Charlie.

190
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Madam.

191
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
What did Dr. Meng say?

192
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Dr. Meng said

193
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
although his condition was temporarily under control,

194
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
he wanted to stay and take care of Yiman.

195
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
He wanted to leave after the condition was completely stable.

196
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Dr. Meng was thoughtful.

197
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I'm relieved to have him.

198
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Yes.

199
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Since Dr. Joseph is fine now,

200
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
let's go back and rest.

201
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
It's too late to disturb you.

202
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I'm sorry.

203
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
You're welcome.

204
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
We're neighbors.

205
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
It's better to stay away from each other.

206
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
If you need anything, just tell me.

207
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I'll thank you on behalf of Dr. Joseph.

208
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Okay.

209
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Thank you, Mr. Liang.

210
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Okay, everyone.

211
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Since Mr. Li is fine now,

212
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
and Dr. Meng is with him,

213
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
you should go back and rest.

214
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
See you.

215
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
See you.

216
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Okay, Yiman.

217
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I'm leaving, too.

218
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Okay.

219
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Mr. Liang.

220
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
What can I do for you?

221
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
If you have any questions,

222
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
please let me know in advance.

223
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
The rule is death,

224
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
and the person is the soul.

225
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Don't worry, Mr. Liang.

226
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
If anything happens to Mr. Li,

227
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I'll be the first to answer.

228
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Okay.

229
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Thank you.

230
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I'll be the first to answer.

231
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Okay, Mr. Liang.

232
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Go home.

233
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Goodbye, Mr. Liang.

234
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Goodbye, Mr. Liang.

235
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Go home.

236
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Close the door.

237
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Thank you.

238
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Thank you.

239
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Why is Xiao Huanglong here?

240
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
He's here to help me spread the news.

241
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Him?

242
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Yes.

243
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Don't forget.

244
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
He knows everything.

245
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
He won't report us, will he?

246
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
No.

247
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
If he reports us,

248
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
he won't get a penny from the Japanese.

249
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
But if he keeps them,

250
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
he's a drug lord.

251
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
The last time,

252
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I didn't have the time to thank you.

253
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I'll make trouble for you tonight.

254
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
You're welcome.

255
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
As long as I can help Brother Shixian,

256
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
you can always find me.

257
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Head.

258
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
One.

259
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Two.

260
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
One.

261
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Head.

262
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Two.

263
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
One.

264
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
One.

265
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
What do you mean?

266
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
The war has decided

267
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
to use the red peach code as bait

268
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
to continue to send the storm and lure the enemy.

269
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
So we can send the first one?

270
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Yes.

271
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Great.

272
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Head.

273
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Meng.

274
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Thank you for today.

275
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
But I have a question.

276
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Brother Shixian.

277
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
You don't have to be so polite to me.

278
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Just tell me what you want to say.

279
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Okay.

280
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I want to see if you can stay here tonight.

281
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
So Liang Jinyuan will think that Li Yue Se is really sick.

282
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
You can leave tomorrow morning.

283
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Is that okay?

284
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Okay.

285
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I have to call home.

286
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Thank you.

287
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
The Red Peach Code

288
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
One is enough.

289
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Three.

290
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Every month, you pay one year.

291
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
You're crazy.

292
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
You have no money.

293
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Get off.

294
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Get off.

295
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
What do you want?

296
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
In 1926,

297
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Chief Dai gave me blood.

298
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Since then,

299
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I have never been in contact with him.

300
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
He is more important than my life.

301
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Money is not important.

302
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Take it.

303
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
We can discuss about money.

304
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Can you afford a pound of gold

305
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
from your shit?

306
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
What the hell is this?

307
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
You want me to sell my life for you?

308
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Take it away.

309
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Take it away.

310
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
As long as you send my message,

311
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I will find a way to get enough money

312
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
to redeem my brother.

313
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Do as you say.

314
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
The Red Peach Code

315
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I found that people in your field

316
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
are good at acting.

317
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I'm so angry.

318
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Tonight, those two firecrackers

319
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
made a big noise.

320
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I was so angry inside.

321
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Charlie's face was changed.

322
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
He looked better than

323
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Jin Ke's self-improvement.

324
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
You guys are so smart.

325
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
If you want to make money,

326
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
you have to make a lot of money.

327
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Why do you have to make revolution?

328
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
What's going on?

329
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
The little bastard who pretended to be Johnson Lee

330
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
made a big noise

331
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
in the whole Sanyang.

332
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
The police even asked a doctor to treat him.

333
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I successfully

334
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
gave the message to Charlie

335
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
in this corner.

336
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Come here.

337
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I want to talk to you.

338
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Tonight, the most unexpected thing

339
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
is that this little bastard

340
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
raised a big star,

341
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Xian Biyun.

342
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Do you know Xian Biyun?

343
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Big star, you are so bad.

344
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Where is this reasonable?

345
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
This is the information

346
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Guyang Mountain gave you.

347
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
How can you take it so easily?

348
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
They are doing business, my friend.

349
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,000
You told me to send the message inside.

350
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Now I'm bringing you the information.

351
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
For the sake of my friend,

352
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I'll count three little yellow fish every month.

353
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
In total, six little yellow fish every month,

354
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
one year less.

355
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
How much time do you have?

356
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I have a lot of time.

357
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I didn't get that much.

358
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
You still have four little yellow fish.

359
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Give me a few more days.

360
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I find you,

361
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
you really don't trust me.

362
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,000
I'll give you one last chance.

363
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Just three days.

364
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Okay.

365
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I promise.

366
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I don't want to cooperate with you.

367
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
I don't want to.

368
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
I don't want to.

369
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I don't want to.

370
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
It was too hard for Dr. Meng last night.

371
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
When Joseph gets better,

372
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
we'll be there to see him.

373
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Yes.

374
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
I'll do my best.

375
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
If you need anything,

376
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
just tell me.

377
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Mr. Li, Miss Xian,

378
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
you don't have to be so polite.

379
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
It's the doctor's duty to cure patients.

380
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
And Mr. Li's condition is not stable.

381
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
He needs to be checked regularly.

382
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
If you need anything,

383
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
you can find me anytime.

384
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Okay.

385
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Charlie,

386
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
this is my family's phone number.

387
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
If the hospital can't find me,

388
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
call this number.

389
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Okay.

390
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
I'll go now.

391
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Thank you, Dr. Meng.

392
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Thank you.

393
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Let's go.

394
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
What are you doing?

395
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
What's the hurry?

396
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Slow down.

397
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Slow down.

398
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
What's the hurry?

399
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Wait a minute.

400
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
What's the hurry?

401
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
What's the hurry?

402
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
What's the hurry?

403
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
What's the hurry?

404
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Okay.

405
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Here you are.

406
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
What's this?

407
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
The red peach code.

408
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
You've already found it out so quickly?

409
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Actually, after I returned to the Shanghai Station,

410
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
I've been communicating with my superior

411
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
with the red peach code.

412
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
I've also participated in the latest nuclear calculations

413
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
of the red peach code.

414
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
These are all the contents I've collected.

415
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
I've sorted them overnight.

416
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
But there's one more part

417
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
that I need to decipher according to the current information.

418
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
I'll give it to you later.

419
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
This is the 10 passwords

420
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Liang Junyuan gave me last time.

421
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
I've also deciphered them.

422
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Tomorrow, you just need to give this book to him.

423
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
But the red peach code,

424
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
you still have to memorize it all

425
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
without any mistakes.

426
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
In case there's an emergency at the site tomorrow.

427
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Then I don't think I have to wait for tomorrow.

428
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
I can memorize it all tonight.

429
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
How about this?

430
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Tonight,

431
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:38,600
we'll put this deciphering

432
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
code on the red peach code.

433
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
It's not real.

434
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Who am I?

435
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Li Yuese.

436
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
What is Li Yuese?

437
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
A genius.

438
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
It's not that he's a genius.

439
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
He's just not real.

440
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
If we really put this result

441
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
on the same day as them,

442
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
how can we show our abilities?

443
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
How can we get married in the future?

444
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
We have to give them a little help

445
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
to show them how good Li Yuese is.

446
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Only then can we be able to die.

447
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
But you have to give me some time

448
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
to decipher the rest of it.

449
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Yuese.

450
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
But you're right.

451
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
If you want to stand out,

452
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
give me nine hours.

453
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
I'll decipher the rest of it.

454
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
You memorize all of it.

455
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
No problem.

456
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
But

457
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
I still have to remind you

458
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
not to be careless.

459
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Do you know why Liang Jingyuan

460
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
would ask three groups of experts to come here?

461
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
He doesn't understand the code at all.

462
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
The reason why he asked three groups of experts

463
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
to come here

464
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
is to verify and verify each other's code.

465
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
If one group of experts

466
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
is lying,

467
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
the other two groups

468
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
will find the problem.

469
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Liang Jingyuan is a cruel person.

470
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
He cares about the code so much.

471
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
So the killing he said

472
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
is not that simple.

473
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
If we make a mistake,

474
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
we will be doomed.

475
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Don't worry.

476
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Since I promised to help you,

477
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
I won't back down.

478
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
I'll be with you next time.

479
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Thank you.

480
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
I'll be with you next time.

481
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Miss Xin.

482
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Thank you for what you did.

483
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
You don't have to thank me.

484
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
But there are some things

485
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
I think it's necessary to make it clear.

486
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
I'm here to protect

487
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Ding Yi's safety.

488
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
I don't want to do

489
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
what I want to do.

490
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
I won't ask

491
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
about your business.

492
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Likewise,

493
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
don't ask

494
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
what I do.

495
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
We won't interfere with each other.

496
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
It's best to do so.

497
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Now we three

498
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
live under the same roof.

499
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
We shouldn't want to see

500
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Ding Yi

501
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
hurt because of you and me.

502
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
I hope that

503
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
no matter what you do in the future,

504
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
you will tell me in advance.

505
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
I want to say hello to you.

506
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
You were so smart

507
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
yesterday.

508
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Will I still do business

509
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
with Mr. Li?

510
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Business and future are important.

511
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
You don't know that.

512
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Did you check the smoke

513
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
yesterday?

514
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Is there a problem?

515
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Yes.

516
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
What problem?

517
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
It's too heavy.

518
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Mr. Yang.

519
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Did you send the person?

520
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Yes.

521
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
I didn't expect that

522
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
he would be so generous.

523
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
It's the house of

524
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
the chief of the health department, Meng Mingyi.

525
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Yes.

526
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Let's go.

527
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
The person is Meng Mingyi.

528
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
He is now a big star

529
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
in the Japanese's company.

530
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Mr. Liang.

531
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Do you want to investigate?

532
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
I'm sorry.

533
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
I'm sorry.

534
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
I'm sorry.

535
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
I'm sorry.

536
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
I'm sorry.

537
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
I'm sorry.

538
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
I'm sorry.

539
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
I'm sorry.

540
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
I'm sorry.

541
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
I'm sorry.

542
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
I'm sorry.

543
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
I'm sorry.

544
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
I'm sorry.

545
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
I'm sorry.

546
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
I'm sorry.

547
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
I'm sorry.

548
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
I'm sorry.

549
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
I'm sorry.

550
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
I'm sorry.

551
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
I'm sorry.

552
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
I'm sorry.

553
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
I'm sorry.

554
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
I'm sorry.

555
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
I'm sorry.

556
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
I'm sorry.

557
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
I'm sorry.

558
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
I'm sorry.

559
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
I'm sorry.

560
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
I'm sorry.

561
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Time to go.

562
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Director,

563
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:45,960
you have to Business

564
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Yes.

565
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Director Li,

566
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
you did a good job.

567
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Good, good, good.

568
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Director Li,

569
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
how is the progress?

570
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
According to the materials provided by Director Liang,

571
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
I have already transferred all the materials

572
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
that could be transferred.

573
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
In addition to the half-page code,

574
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
I think

575
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
I should be able to control

576
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
most of the information of this radio station.

577
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Such a large amount of computing

578
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
have you done?

579
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
It's a shame to say.

580
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
If it wasn't for the re-release of the brain,

581
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
I think

582
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
I should have been able to

583
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
break it all down

584
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
before 9 o'clock this morning.

585
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
It wasted my whole day.

586
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Director Liang.

587
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Hello, Director Liang.

588
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Hello, Director Liang.

589
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Why is Director Li here?

590
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Are you feeling better?

591
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Thank you for your concern, Director Liang.

592
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
I'm here to give you the result of the analysis.

593
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Director Liang, please take a look.

594
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
So fast?

595
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
As a researcher,

596
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
the most important thing

597
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
is to be strict.

598
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Of course,

599
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
I can understand that

600
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
information work must be fought in seconds.

601
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
So, I can only

602
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
give you the result of my analysis

603
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
to show you.

604
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Even if there is half a code,

605
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
it's impossible for you two

606
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
to complete such a large amount of work

607
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
in just two days.

608
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Yes, how is that possible?

609
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Yes, it's impossible.

610
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Director Li just had a headache yesterday.

611
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
He just recovered today.

612
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Director Li, do you want to rest?

613
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
It's okay.

614
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
It seems that you don't believe me.

615
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Today, I will read the secret text

616
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
in front of you

617
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
and read it to you.

618
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
You can pick a few secret texts.

619
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Okay.

620
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Mr. Li,

621
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:36,000
26-5-3-13-13-5-3-3-5-1

622
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
3-1-1-1-4-2-2-3-1-1-2

623
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:44,000
6-8-5-4-3-8-3-3-3-3-6-2-8

624
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:53,000
1861-268-0-1-4-3-8-4-3-6-2-1-3-5-1-2-5-1

625
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Wu Tian colluded with the navy

626
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
to leak Li Yue's password

627
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
and commit suicide for the crime.

628
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
I'm here to help you.

629
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:23,000
1584-2-4-5-2-1-5-1-5-1

630
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Li Yue has appeared.

631
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Kill him as soon as possible.

632
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
It's really broken.

633
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Next group.

634
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:47,000
25-8-3-2-6-5-2-1-1-1-1-1

635
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
The jade seal in Shanghai

636
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,000
belongs to Liang Ni and Jing Yuan.

637
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Kill him.

638
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
It's really broken.

639
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,000
I don't think we need to waste everyone's time

640
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
and keep reading it.

641
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Okay.

642
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
I still don't believe it.

643
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Did you have any contact with the military?

644
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Did you get other reference information in advance?

645
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Xiaodong.

646
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Mr. Dou.

647
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Are you suspecting that our Mr. Li is a mole?

648
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
I don't know.

649
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
I don't know.

650
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
I don't know.

651
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
I don't know.

652
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Is our Mr. Li a mole?

653
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Mr. Li is from the Dongyuan Temple family.

654
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,000
So you are suspecting that the Dongyuan Temple family

655
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
is harming Zhong Ruiqin Mountain

656
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
and destroying the Dado Ya's honor.

657
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Don't be angry, Mr. Li.

658
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Xiaodong is so kind.

659
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
I apologize on behalf of him.

660
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Mr. Shen,

661
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
it's okay.

662
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
But what he said

663
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
is not wrong.

664
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
I have a deep connection

665
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,000
with the military.

666
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Their team

667
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
has been kidnapping me for three days.

668
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Now they want my head every day.

669
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
But there is one thing I am very curious about.

670
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
All of you here are cryptologists.

671
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,000
You all made a contribution to the East Asia peace.

672
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
But why

673
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
they don't want to help you?

674
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Is it because

675
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
your heads

676
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
are not big enough?

677
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Do you have any weight?

678
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Director,

679
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
the military radio tower is breaking again.

680
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
You are right on time.

681
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Director Liang,

682
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
the name I gave you is in your hands now.

683
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
But

684
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
you don't trust me.

685
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
It's okay.

686
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
I will solve the mystery

687
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
of this new fire.

688
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Great.

689
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Well,

690
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Director Yi,

691
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Director Shen,

692
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
you together

693
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
can have a good look.

694
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
There is only two words left.

695
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
You don't have to be so sure.

696
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
The two numbers

697
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
are not in the code book.

698
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
I am afraid you will have to guess it.

699
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
There is only one word left.

700
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
It means

701
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
you can't find it.

702
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
The two numbers

703
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
are not in the code book.

704
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,280
I'm going to guess.

705
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,480
Chen Liguang.

706
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,520
The last two characters should be

707
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:22,760
the name of the place.

708
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,440
It's not that surprising.

709
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,080
The name of the person.

710
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:29,720
The name of the person.

711
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,320
Four characters, the name of the person.

712
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,600
Is there a official

713
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:38,120
who believes in the four characters in the new government?

714
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,480
Professor Li is right.

715
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:41,440
There is indeed no official

716
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,760
who believes in the four characters in the new government.

717
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:45,800
Because

718
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,040
the last three characters

719
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,040
are two characters.

720
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:58,680
Mr. Li.

721
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:00,720
Mr. Li.

722
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:08,960
Chinese characters are very profound.

723
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,480
When they are passed the code,

724
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:12,760
if they are passed the code,

725
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,280
if they are passed the relatively common characters,

726
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:18,600
it is very likely that they will be written in Chinese characters.

727
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:20,840
For example,

728
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,360
a bird is a bird,

729
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,080
a village is a village.

730
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:26,440
A ghost is a ghost,

731
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:29,520
a ghost is a ghost.

732
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,360
But this...

733
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:40,000
It seems to be a ghost.

734
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:43,640
The 80th Zhu Chen Ni Medicine Group.

735
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:51,640
Director Liang.

736
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:54,280
Is this Chen Yaozu

737
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:55,640
still in Shanghai?

738
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:57,040
Director.

739
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:58,520
Director Chen Yaozu is going to Xinya Hotel

740
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:00,360
at eight o'clock to hold a peace speech.

741
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,280
What time is it now?

742
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:05,120
What time is it?

743
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:06,400
Director Liang.

744
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:08,920
This kind of big thing should be reported as soon as possible.

745
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:10,640
Yes.

746
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:15,960
Can you be responsible for the result of your defection?

747
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,040
It seems that Director Liang

748
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,920
still doesn't believe in my ability to defy.

749
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:25,680
I can be responsible for my result of defection.

750
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:26,840
And you,

751
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:30,480
can you be responsible for your suspicion?

752
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:39,880
If it's really a letter,

753
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,960
then the difficult point we were stuck in

754
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:43,200
seems to be solved.

755
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,200
That... That telegram last year.

756
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:47,600
Yes.

757
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:49,480
This gentleman has been talking about

758
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:52,600
a minister of a certain culture and a certain department.

759
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:56,120
This is our military minister,

760
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:57,240
Bao Wenyue.

761
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:06,440
Mu Yueyue.

762
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,320
Director Yi, are you stuck there too?

763
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:10,960
No problem now, right?

764
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:15,280
Director Li is a genius.

765
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:20,480
Director Shen, you're overpraising me.

766
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:22,480
We are learning from each other

767
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:24,080
and identifying with each other.

768
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:25,840
I think Director Liang

769
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:27,360
gathered us here

770
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,120
for the same purpose.

771
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:32,360
Director Liang is a genius.

772
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:37,760
What?

773
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:48,600
jà tury l dans

774
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:55,080
in China

775
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:40,320
Where is the heart?

776
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:42,320
Who's window is shaking?

777
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:44,320
The words on the floor

778
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:47,320
The heart is thinking

779
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:49,320
Or you or me

780
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:54,320
I'm watching

781
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:58,320
In the vast night

782
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:01,320
The tears are falling

783
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:05,320
A pair of hurt

784
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:09,320
I'm watching

785
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:12,320
In the vast night

786
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:15,320
The night falls

787
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:19,320
The night is bright

788
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:23,320
I'm watching

789
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:26,320
In the vast night

790
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:30,320
The tears are falling

791
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:34,320
A pair of hurt

792
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:37,320
I'm watching

793
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:41,320
In the vast night

794
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:44,320
The night falls

795
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:48,320
Looking back, it's already dawn

796
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:51,320
The night falls

797
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:57,320
Looking back, it's already dawn

798
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:09,320
Thanks for watching!
