1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,580
shooters and

2
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:41,260
Mr. Li,

3
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:44,300
the ship tickets to Hong Kong are ready for sale tomorrow.

4
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:46,020
I'm sorry.

5
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:47,380
There are too many people who want to buy the tickets.

6
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:48,100
I'm late.

7
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:49,380
It's okay.

8
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:52,300
Mr. Li,

9
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:54,420
you're leaving?

10
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:56,460
Yes.

11
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,140
Actually,

12
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,020
I'm here to say goodbye to you.

13
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,220
This last glass of wine...

14
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:09,900
Thank you.

15
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:11,900
is our

16
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,300
last glass of wine.

17
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:20,820
Why?

18
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:23,980
Actually,

19
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,060
I don't have to leave.

20
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,220
But what's the point of staying?

21
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:32,980
My password has been leaked.

22
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:33,780
Mr. Li,

23
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:38,860
do you know what you just said?

24
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:43,740
Everyone in Jiangcheng must not leave.

25
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:47,500
Mr. Li,

26
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,380
where did you get the password?

27
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:52,660
The British.

28
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,460
Is it Mr. William?

29
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:58,700
Why did they tell you?

30
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:02,260
William and I have been friends for many years.

31
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:05,740
He didn't like me being?

32
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:07,860
So he told me.

33
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:09,420
Actually, Mr. Wu,

34
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:12,140
I didn't want to say this today.

35
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:13,980
But I think,

36
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,580
as a brother,

37
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:17,420
I have to give you an advice.

38
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:21,420
Change my password as soon as possible.

39
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:22,940
In case of leaking.

40
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,140
How do they know?

41
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,660
There are too many people in the trap.

42
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:33,540
It's not impossible to leak the password.

43
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:38,420
Impossible?

44
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:43,380
We have a very high security level.

45
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,980
The security of the security team

46
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:48,660
has never been solved.

47
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:52,940
If you have leaked the password,

48
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:56,620
I can't help but suspect you.

49
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:58,420
Yes!

50
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:00,660
Wu Tian,

51
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:03,260
you are insulting me.

52
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:06,700
This password is my life-long wish.

53
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,420
Why would I leak it?

54
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:09,620
It's my honor.

55
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,460
It's your trap.

56
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,820
You broke my heart.

57
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:18,340
For your sake,

58
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:22,820
I have to ask you and Zai Jiang

59
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:26,300
to talk to the trap.

60
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:28,180
Yes!

61
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:29,420
Yes, sir!

62
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:32,260
Take him away!

63
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:33,500
Take him away!

64
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:34,180
Wait!

65
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:52,620
Woo

66
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:55,900
We lost the alcohol tip.

67
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,460
Thank you.

68
00:04:58,740 --> 00:04:59,340
Here,

69
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:02,220
as a thanks to your hard work.

70
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,700
I swear in the name of my adoptive father,

71
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:10,860
I never did anything wrong

72
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:13,380
to betray the Empire of Japan.

73
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:20,220
The Eastern Plains is under the Great Wall.

74
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:24,420
The Eastern Plains is under the Great Wall.

75
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:26,860
The Eastern Plains?

76
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,820
That's the side of the Heavenly Emperor.

77
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:34,700
You have such a dangerous background.

78
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,380
You didn't tell me.

79
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:38,660
I didn't tell you.

80
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:41,060
I never heard of it.

81
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:44,100
What does the Eastern Plains have to do with it?

82
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:45,700
Chief Wu Tian.

83
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:49,580
Do you really think that if there is no such relationship,

84
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:51,620
I would come to Shanghai

85
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:52,940
and help you work?

86
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,500
What kind of identity does my adoptive father have?

87
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,500
Do I have to inform you

88
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,020
about my adoptive father?

89
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,820
I will tell you these things.

90
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,100
I will verify it.

91
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:07,420
Verify it?

92
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:10,260
I am here to save the seven princes and mission

93
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:11,820
of the Eastern Plains.

94
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,420
I came here to work for you.

95
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:15,340
Now,

96
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:17,300
you suspect my loyalty.

97
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:19,940
This is not only a humiliation to me,

98
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:22,660
but also a humiliation to my adoptive father.

99
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:24,540
Mr. Li.

100
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:27,060
I don't need you to

101
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,180
insult the Eastern Plains.

102
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:30,260
Okay.

103
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,500
Don't you want to verify it?

104
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:33,980
No problem.

105
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,300
I will give you a chance to verify it.

106
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:36,340
Now,

107
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:37,660
send a message

108
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:38,860
to blow up

109
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:40,380
the Chinese troops around Shanghai.

110
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:41,900
If the enemy's military camp

111
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,300
doesn't react,

112
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,500
we will all be happy.

113
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:47,220
You will not lose anything.

114
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:48,460
On the contrary,

115
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:49,580
if it is confirmed

116
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:51,340
that my password has been leaked,

117
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,220
you still have time to make up for it.

118
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:53,860
Otherwise,

119
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:56,940
all the losses in the future of the Great Japanese Empire

120
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:58,820
will be on your head.

121
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:05,460
át

122
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:16,700
Captain.

123
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:19,980
His greater good is busy in the law firm.

124
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:20,900
Today,

125
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,940
he is going to move out of Eastern Plains.

126
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,580
He has no face to sit back

127
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,580
over the absurdities.

128
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,060
clockwise

129
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:31,460
clockwise

130
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:32,260
clockwise

131
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:32,700
clockwise

132
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:33,100
clockwise

133
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:33,580
clockwise

134
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:50,560
lan tastes.

135
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,160
and blown out your lips,

136
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,440
and then stock it up with words 一

137
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,960
because your house is也,

138
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,560
and people call me the ''Mirror'',

139
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,760
and fool the way you think I am,

140
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,240
with that one chance,

141
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,560
there must be another meaning.

142
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,440
You guys gonna get out of here and get laid,

143
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,600
or we will go to C Doll,

144
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:13,800
to hell?

145
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,080
If the dollar

146
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,560
Here.

147
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,760
You're a good actor.

148
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,760
How can you make the audience believe

149
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,560
that you're acting?

150
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,080
Jiaxi Acupuncture.

151
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,160
You're a student.

152
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,560
Be careful, Chief Wu Tian.

153
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,560
Okay.

154
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,200
Are you okay?

155
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,560
Let's go.

156
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,360
Take her out.

157
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,360
Yes.

158
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:34,960
Let's go.

159
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,760
Our men will be waiting for us under the window.

160
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,560
Jiaxi Acupuncture.

161
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,560
Mother!

162
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,560
Jiaxi Acupuncture.

163
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,560
What happened?

164
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,560
Mr. Li, I'm sorry.

165
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,560
I didn't protect you.

166
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,560
Chief Wu Tian.

167
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,560
What are you doing?

168
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,160
Call an ambulance.

169
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,560
Chief.

170
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,560
It seems like a military operation.

171
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,360
And...

172
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,160
We found this one.

173
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,560
It's a military operation.

174
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,560
It's a military operation.

175
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,560
It's a military operation.

176
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,560
It's a military operation.

177
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,560
It's a military operation.

178
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,560
It's a military operation.

179
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,560
Chief Wu Tian.

180
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,560
There's no evidence.

181
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,560
This service officer

182
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,560
was sent by the military to assassinate Mr. Li.

183
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,560
Mr. Li did his best

184
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,560
to serve the Japanese Empire.

185
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,560
Chief Wu Tian,

186
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,560
don't you believe in Mr. Li?

187
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,560
It's really a small accident.

188
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,560
Call an ambulance.

189
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,560
Chief Wu Tian.

190
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,560
Mr. Li is a friend of the Japanese Empire.

191
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,560
He almost died in the hands of the anti-Japanese.

192
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,560
If anything happens to him today,

193
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,560
who can take the responsibility?

194
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,560
Chief.

195
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,560
What you found here

196
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,560
is my responsibility.

197
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,560
Wait here.

198
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,560
Hey.

199
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,560
Take care of this guy.

200
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,560
Chief.

201
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,560
Tell Chief Aota.

202
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,560
Chief Aota.

203
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,560
I have a favor to ask.

204
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,560
Please.

205
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,560
Chief Aota.

206
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,560
I have a favor to ask.

207
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,560
Please.

208
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,560
Chief Aota.

209
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,560
I have a favor to ask.

210
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,560
Please.

211
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,560
Chief Aota.

212
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,560
I have a favor to ask.

213
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,560
Please.

214
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,560
Chief Aota.

215
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,560
I have a favor to ask.

216
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,560
Please.

217
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,560
Chief Aota.

218
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,560
I have a favor to ask.

219
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,560
Chief Aota.

220
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,560
Yes, this is Bakuda.

221
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:06,560
Chief Takeda has ordered the Air Force No. 1 and No. 3

222
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,560
to take off.

223
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,560
Unfortunately,

224
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:16,560
the People's Army 405 has taken off at 8 o'clock.

225
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,560
I'm sorry.

226
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,560
Thank you.

227
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,560
I've been working for you

228
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,560
for thousands of years

229
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,560
and I've been suspected

230
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,560
by you three times.

231
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,560
Today,

232
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,560
I'm in such a mess.

233
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,560
I'm blind.

234
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,560
Yes.

235
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,560
Mr. Li is right.

236
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:06,560
What we did was wrong.

237
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,560
We have to prove that we suspect everyone.

238
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,560
Mr. Li.

239
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,560
I'll send you to the hospital.

240
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,560
You can go back to work.

241
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,560
Yes.

242
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,560
Yes, this is Kobayashi.

243
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,560
Yes.

244
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,560
Chief.

245
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,560
What?

246
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,560
The air force warning was also issued

247
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,560
from the headquarters of the Communist Party.

248
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,560
Yes.

249
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,560
Get on the ambulance quickly.

250
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,560
Yes.

251
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,560
Mr. Li, there is a step.

252
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,560
I ask you to take care of Lisa.

253
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,560
Yes.

254
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,560
Yes.

255
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,560
Please.

256
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,560
Thank you.

257
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,560
Yes.

258
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,560
Thank you.

259
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,560
Please.

260
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,560
Thank you.

261
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,560
Thank you.

262
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,560
Thank you.

263
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,560
Thank you.

264
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,560
Thank you.

265
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,560
Did you arrange

266
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,560
tonight's event in advance?

267
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,560
Why didn't you tell me in advance?

268
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,560
I'm afraid that Wu Tian won't believe you.

269
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,560
So I arranged this.

270
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,560
If I'm honest,

271
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,560
Wu Tian won't believe you.

272
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,560
We did this

273
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,560
for your own good.

274
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,560
For my own good?

275
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,560
For my own good?

276
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,560
You let Lao Gu die?

277
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,560
You let Lao Gu die?

278
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,560
Kobayashi, you don't believe me.

279
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,560
Why did you let me do this?

280
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,560
Now it's okay.

281
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,560
You don't trust me.

282
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,560
That's why you killed Lao Gu.

283
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,560
Kobayashi, are you still human?

284
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,560
Do you think I would let

285
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,560
Lao Gu die?

286
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,560
You are a soldier.

287
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,560
But he is my family.

288
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,560
I can't stop him from going to the battlefield.

289
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,560
But who would let his family

290
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,560
to send him to death?

291
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,560
No.

292
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,560
This is absolutely not right.

293
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,560
I said, don't persuade me.

294
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,560
Master,

295
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,560
you are not suitable.

296
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,560
I will go.

297
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,560
You go?

298
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,560
Is your leg suitable?

299
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,560
Don't hesitate.

300
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,560
This is the best way.

301
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,560
Don't forget,

302
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,560
I'm not only a soldier,

303
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,560
but also a soldier of the Gu family.

304
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,560
If your identity is exposed,

305
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,560
Ding will die.

306
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,560
He needs you more.

307
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,560
I will go.

308
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,560
Master Gu,

309
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,560
how about this?

310
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,560
After we talk,

311
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,560
I will put you in the window.

312
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,560
Then I will push you down.

313
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,560
Our people will come to pick you up.

314
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,560
When they get to you,

315
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,560
I will send you to your mother's ship.

316
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,560
I will go to the ship.

317
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,560
I will come to you.

318
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,560
Today's plan is

319
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,560
after Uncle Gu's death,

320
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,560
Ding will jump off the second floor.

321
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,560
Those who are in front of him

322
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,560
will send him to the dock

323
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,560
and leave immediately.

324
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,560
We have already discussed this.

325
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,560
But why didn't he do anything?

326
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,560
He promised me.

327
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,560
He promised me.

328
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,560
But Ding, I tell you,

329
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,560
tonight's plan,

330
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,560
we never thought of letting you die.

331
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,560
I promised you,

332
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,560
if there is danger,

333
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,560
I will stand in front of you.

334
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,560
I will never lie to you.

335
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:11,880
ас

336
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:29,540
One, two, three, jump!

337
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:31,540
Come here!

338
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:35,980
Get away...

339
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,560
I'm sorry.

340
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,560
Look at him. Look at him.

341
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,560
Slow down.

342
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:46,560
Come on.

343
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,560
Is Gu

344
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,560
my comrade?

345
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:06,560
Comrade Xiao,

346
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:09,560
Wu Tian is a man of many words.

347
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:14,560
Ding Yi's combat experience is not rich enough.

348
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,560
I'm afraid that

349
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,560
if Ding Yi can't convince Wu Tian,

350
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:23,560
I decided to leave a good hand for him.

351
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:28,560
I need to kill Li Yueze at the banquet.

352
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:32,560
I can make the Japanese believe in Li Yueze's loyalty.

353
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:36,560
Only then will they not doubt Ding Yi's words.

354
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:51,560
I know this is a dead end.

355
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:55,560
But Li Yueze's secret is not out for a day.

356
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:59,560
Thousands of miles of land will be destroyed.

357
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,320
I've been a

358
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:04,560
husband and wife for years

359
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,560
with Gu Zhengze.

360
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:11,560
Now it's a dead end.

361
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,560
If I can make the most of it

362
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,560
when the country is in danger,

363
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:22,560
I will die in Wuhan.

364
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:26,560
Please forgive my late-battle report.

365
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,560
Ding Yi

366
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,560
is a good boy.

367
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,560
Let me

368
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:37,560
see him off again.

369
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,560
My dear comrades,

370
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,560
goodbye.

371
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,560
This is the cherry tree

372
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:08,560
that I brought from Kyoto.

373
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,560
The cherry trees in Japan

374
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:15,560
are very beautiful

375
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,560
and beautiful.

376
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,560
The cherry trees in Japan

377
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,560
are very beautiful

378
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,560
and beautiful.

379
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,560
The cherry trees in Japan

380
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,560
are very beautiful

381
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,560
and beautiful.

382
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,560
But the cherry trees in Japan

383
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,560
are not suitable for China.

384
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,560
I don't think so.

385
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:48,560
But if you grow them properly,

386
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:51,560
the cherry trees in Japan

387
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:55,560
will be able to bloom in China.

388
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,560
Takeda Kenjiro

389
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,560
Takeda Kenjiro

390
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,560
Takeda Kenjiro

391
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,560
came to say goodbye

392
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,560
to Colonel Sasaki.

393
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,560
Takeda Kenjiro

394
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,560
did you do something wrong?

395
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,560
I found the code of Ryuesawa

396
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,560
in my own room.

397
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,560
I will take responsibility

398
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,560
for the failure of the information battle.

399
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,560
I see.

400
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,560
The information battle

401
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,560
was developed by a team

402
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,560
that handled the information

403
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,560
and the information.

404
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,560
But it was all wasted.

405
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,560
I am very sorry.

406
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,560
I was incompetent.

407
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,560
I will take the blame

408
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,560
and make amends.

409
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,560
Takeda Kenjiro

410
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,560
Bushido's spirit looks great,

411
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,560
but

412
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,560
even if you die,

413
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,560
you can't take it back.

414
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,560
It's easy to die.

415
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,560
What you should do

416
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:41,560
is to live and atone for your sins.

417
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,560
I was worried

418
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,560
that Ryuesawa

419
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,560
had a problem with his money.

420
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,560
But he said

421
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,560
he was a good son of the late Emperor.

422
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,560
And he also has a picture

423
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:15,560
of the late Emperor

424
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,560
holding him when he was young.

425
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,560
We can easily question

426
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,560
the reason for his death.

427
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,560
His father

428
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:29,560
was a math teacher

429
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,560
of the late Emperor.

430
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,560
When the Emperor recommended him,

431
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,560
he had already been tested.

432
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:41,560
I wonder if he is a good son.

433
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,560
If you say so,

434
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,560
I will say so.

435
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,560
If you can't do it,

436
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,560
let other people do it.

437
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,560
In China,

438
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,560
there is no emperor

439
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,560
like the Emperor of Japan.

440
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,560
Each person acts on his own.

441
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,560
Each person has his own secrets.

442
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,560
Each person has his own way of thinking.

443
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,560
To get along with them,

444
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,560
you need skills.

445
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:38,560
You have to have the will and the will.

446
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,560
You need to be able to

447
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,560
use your friends in China.

448
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:49,560
So you are asking the Chinese

449
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,560
to find out about the Chinese?

450
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,560
There is a Chinese saying

451
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,560
called the zhó shán guán fú dō.

452
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,560
Zhó shán guán fú dō.

453
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,560
Zhó shán guán fú dō.

454
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:41,560
If you change the password,

455
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,560
you will be safe.

456
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,560
Yes, I am safe.

457
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,560
Have you eaten?

458
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:05,560
I will order some breakfast.

459
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,560
Don't bother.

460
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,560
We don't know the relationship

461
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:15,560
between Dongyuan Temple and Li Yue Se.

462
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:17,560
It won't take long

463
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,560
before they will take the boat.

464
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:20,560
So I arranged

465
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,560
to send you to Hong Kong

466
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,560
by tonight's boat.

467
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:26,560
There are people

468
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,560
who will pick you up at Wanwang Lake.

469
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,560
You will meet in Hong Kong.

470
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,560
That's all?

471
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:42,560
The show is over.

472
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:44,560
Everyone is gone.

473
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:46,560
Why? Are you unhappy?

474
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,560
I am not unhappy.

475
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,560
I am happy.

476
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,560
Maybe there is

477
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:58,560
a bigger stage waiting for me.

478
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,560
Here, this is your passport.

479
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,560
Take it.

480
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:08,560
The money is in the box.

481
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,560
It should be enough for you to relax for a while.

482
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:14,560
I wish you can play your favorite role

483
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,560
on the new stage.

484
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:34,560
What are you doing?

485
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,560
I am going to the stage.

486
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:37,560
I have to say goodbye to everyone.

487
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:44,560
The organization has agreed

488
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:46,560
to let the people of the troupe leave first.

489
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:49,560
I have already told everyone

490
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:51,560
that tomorrow, in the name of the show,

491
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:52,560
they will go to the countryside

492
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,560
to take a break.

493
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,560
They will come back

494
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,560
after the show is over.

495
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,560
Where are you going?

496
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,560
I am going to the troupe

497
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,560
to talk to Miss Xian.

498
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:27,560
We have achieved great success this time.

499
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:29,560
The Japanese and the military

500
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:30,560
must have been watching us.

501
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:32,560
Before we get caught in trouble,

502
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,560
we will leave after the show tonight.

503
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,560
Let's go.

504
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,560
Bi Yu,

505
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,560
I understand your feelings.

506
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:23,560
After all, you created this troupe.

507
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:26,560
You don't want to see it destroyed in your hands.

508
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,560
But,

509
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,560
since we agreed to help Ding Yi,

510
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:31,560
you should have this psychological preparation.

511
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,560
Besides,

512
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,560
as long as we protect these members,

513
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,560
one day,

514
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,560
we will form a new troupe.

515
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,560
The foreigners are here.

516
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,560
The street is getting more and more dangerous.

517
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,560
There is our base near Kunshan.

518
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,560
It should be able to guarantee everyone's safety.

519
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:01,560
You go to Ding Yi

520
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,560
and tell him to leave with the troupe.

521
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,560
Also,

522
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,560
Hong Yu's application for membership

523
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,560
can also improve the popularity.

524
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:10,560
Okay.

525
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,560
Yu Yun!

526
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:14,560
You are...

527
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,560
so popular.

528
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,560
Is Miss Xian Bingbing here?

529
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,560
Who is this woman?

530
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:28,560
Ye Ying.

531
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,560
Ye Ying?

532
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:31,560
I know.

533
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:34,560
She is the wife of Liang Jiyuan, the commander of Suzhou.

534
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,560
Chief,

535
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,560
the Crown Prince...

536
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:40,560
The other day,

537
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,560
the wife of Liang Jiyuan,

538
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,560
the commander of Suzhou,

539
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,560
Ye Ying,

540
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,560
told us that

541
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:51,560
our information was already leaked.

542
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:57,560
Did she tell you anything about that information?

543
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,560
She told us that

544
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,560
the same information was leaked from the British.

545
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,560
I took her to the dance hall

546
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,560
where the chairman of William's company was present

547
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:08,560
and told the Japanese

548
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,560
that the information was leaked.

549
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:14,560
I heard that

550
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:17,560
the information that Li Yunse designed for the Japanese

551
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:21,560
was already leaked to the British.

552
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:23,560
Really?

553
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:24,560
Really?

554
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,560
So I was thinking,

555
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:31,560
if you could tell the Chairman Wang

556
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,560
about this information,

557
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:37,560
maybe your Liang Jiyuan would come back.

558
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:43,560
That's a good idea!

559
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,560
Many years ago, I saved Liang Jiyuan's life.

560
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:47,560
But he didn't know my real identity.

561
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,560
Now that I look at it,

562
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,560
he might be sent to the Special Forces headquarters.

563
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:54,560
Maybe it's a good chance

564
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,560
to get Ye Ying's information.

565
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:03,560
Shen Wei was also close to the British.

566
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:05,560
That night,

567
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:08,560
after the DUSR went to Chaoshan District,

568
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:11,560
everything started to go wrong.

569
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,560
I should have investigated him sooner.

570
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:16,560
But do you think

571
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,560
we should allow the DUSR

572
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:23,560
to investigate her?

573
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:29,560
We should let the people of the department

574
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:31,560
investigate Chaoshan District.

575
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:33,560
Including Shen Wei himself.

576
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:36,560
Wait.

577
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:38,560
Liang Jiyuan

578
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,560
was probably

579
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:43,560
trying to get into the role of the new government.

580
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:48,560
If he can make this clear,

581
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,560
tell Ye Ying

582
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:52,560
that he will give her the right to be satisfied.

583
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:54,560
Yes.

584
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,560
Miss Jiang, the guests are here.

585
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,560
Mr. Xia.

586
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:00,560
Mrs. Liang is here.

587
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,560
You brought so many gifts.

588
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:03,560
It's my duty.

589
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:06,560
You're a big star.

590
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,560
You're still playing the game?

591
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,560
It's not over yet.

592
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:12,560
You're a big family.

593
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:13,560
You don't understand the game?

594
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:14,560
You're a big family.

595
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,560
It's my first time to come to the forum.

596
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:23,560
It's interesting.

597
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:25,560
And you guys

598
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:27,560
are really good.

599
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:29,560
What's so happy about?

600
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:30,560
Come in and talk.

601
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:34,560
Sit.

602
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,560
I'll do it.

603
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:36,560
Thank you.

604
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:37,560
Thank you.

605
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:43,560
Remember the Japanese password?

606
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:48,560
I didn't believe it when I told the Japanese.

607
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,560
I said,

608
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:50,560
our password

609
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,560
is very high-level.

610
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:53,560
It's impossible to leak.

611
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:55,560
You're out of your mind.

612
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,560
But

613
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:01,560
how did you know

614
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:04,560
such a secret from the British?

615
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:07,560
Look at what you said.

616
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,560
It's like our two families are selling drugs.

617
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,560
You have to ask our ancestral secret recipe.

618
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:14,560
Is it appropriate?

619
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:19,560
That's what Mr. Liang said.

620
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:22,560
But we're very regular.

621
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:24,560
The Japanese said

622
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,560
it was from the British.

623
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:27,560
I didn't mention a word about you.

624
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,560
There's another thing today.

625
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:33,560
Look, I've been away from Shanghai for so long.

626
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:35,560
What's the trend in Shanghai now?

627
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:37,560
I don't know.

628
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:38,560
Are you free today?

629
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:39,560
Go for a ride with me.

630
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:42,560
Not today.

631
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,560
Look at my big table.

632
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:46,560
I can't even finish it.

633
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,560
I'm also planning to do it.

634
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:49,560
It's not a day's difference.

635
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:51,560
Okay.

636
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,560
Next time,

637
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:55,560
I'll have a good time with you next time.

638
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:56,560
Next time, no.

639
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,560
I'm going back to Shanghai.

640
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:58,560
You're going back to Shanghai?

641
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:05,560
Congratulations, Liang.

642
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:10,560
The Chinese newspaper is selling the newspaper.

643
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:13,560
The Chinese newspaper is selling the newspaper.

644
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:16,560
The Chinese newspaper is selling the newspaper.

645
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,560
The Chinese newspaper is selling the newspaper.

646
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,560
Please contact me immediately.

647
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,560
The news is on.

648
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:24,560
Yes.

649
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:28,560
The Chaosheng Group.

650
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,560
Yes, there is such a place.

651
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:37,560
Don't worry, Tai Jun.

652
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,560
As long as you have the money,

653
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:40,560
it's easy.

654
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,560
Come together now.

655
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:02,560
Yes.

656
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,560
Get ready to go.

657
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:05,560
Yes.

658
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:12,560
You're the best.

659
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,560
Is there something wrong with these guys?

660
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,560
They're so fast.

661
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:28,560
Hurry up.

662
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:40,560
Hurry up.

663
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:51,560
Brother Huang.

664
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,560
Poor brother Huang.

665
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,560
I won't leave you again.

666
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:59,560
I won't leave you again.

667
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,560
I want you to leave him.

668
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,560
I don't want you to be together.

669
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,560
You're so unfilial.

670
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:07,560
No.

671
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:08,560
Let go of me.

672
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:10,560
Let go of me.

673
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:11,560
No.

674
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:12,560
Get in.

675
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:13,560
Dad.

676
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:18,560
Stop.

677
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,560
Don't move.

678
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:20,560
What's going on?

679
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:21,560
What are you doing?

680
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:22,560
Director, you're acting again.

681
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:24,560
What are you doing?

682
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:26,560
Brother.

683
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:30,560
You're all so naughty.

684
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:31,560
You're so rude.

685
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:32,560
We're rehearsing.

686
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:33,560
Don't make trouble.

687
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:34,560
Kill them.

688
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:35,560
Don't let them die.

689
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:37,560
Someone reported to the police.

690
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:39,560
Someone is hiding in the police station.

691
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:42,560
Search every corner and take them away.

692
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:55,560
Stop.

693
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:58,560
Dad.

694
00:42:58,560 --> 00:42:59,560
Hongyu.

695
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:01,560
What should we do?

696
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:02,560
Dad.

697
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:04,560
Hongyu.

698
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:05,560
Listen to me.

699
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:06,560
The organization has arranged it.

700
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:08,560
You go to Kunshan by train tomorrow morning.

701
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,560
Go to the boss of the miracle pharmacy.

702
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:13,560
Tell him to send someone to pick us up.

703
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:14,560
Dad, what about you?

704
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:15,560
Don't mind us.

705
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:16,560
Let's go.

706
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:17,560
Come on.

707
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:20,560
Be careful.

708
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:21,560
Be careful.

709
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:23,560
Remember, miracle pharmacy.

710
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:26,560
What are you doing?

711
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:27,560
Take them away.

712
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:28,560
Yes.

713
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:29,560
Go.

714
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:30,560
Okay.

715
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,560
Go.

716
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:27,560
The pain in the eyes

717
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:31,560
The one who is pretending to be serious can't say it clearly

718
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:34,560
Where is the wind going

719
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:36,560
Whose window is shaking

720
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:38,560
The sound of the lock

721
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:41,560
The heart is thinking

722
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:45,560
It's either you or me

723
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:48,560
He is watching

724
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:52,560
In the vast night

725
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:55,560
Tears are floating

726
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:59,560
A bunch of broken wounds

727
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:02,560
He is looking

728
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:06,560
Wandering in the shadow

729
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:09,560
The night falls

730
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:14,560
Looking back at the world

731
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:27,560
The one who is pretending to be serious can't say it clearly

732
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:30,560
Where is the wind going

733
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:33,560
Whose window is shaking

734
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:35,560
The sound of the lock

735
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:37,560
The heart is thinking

736
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:42,560
It's either you or me

737
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:44,560
He is looking

738
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:47,560
Wandering in the shadow

739
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:50,560
The night falls

740
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:53,560
The heart is thinking

741
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:57,560
It's either you or me

742
00:45:57,560 --> 00:46:00,560
He is watching

743
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:03,560
In the vast night
