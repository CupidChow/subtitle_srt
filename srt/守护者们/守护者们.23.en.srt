00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,920
Te하면

2
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:19,200
where is the

3
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:35,000
Thewaitings

4
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,440
Theholding

5
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Who is it?

6
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,640
Li...

7
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,280
Director Li!

8
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,520
Director Li!

9
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,160
Your eyes!

10
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,440
I'm the intelligence officer of Shanghai's underground party.

11
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,680
The organization arranged for me to take you away.

12
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
No.

13
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,080
This morning,

14
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,960
comrade Byun didn't dare to meet you.

15
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,000
Because we have to report to the organization first.

16
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,960
Now comrade Byun has been attacked.

17
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,440
It means that your identities have been exposed.

18
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,720
The next target is likely to be you.

19
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,080
So the organization ordered me to meet you immediately

20
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,160
and take you away.

21
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,920
The car that will pick you up will arrive soon.

22
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,200
It's in the old town.

23
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,720
This is your only chance to leave.

24
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,480
Follow me.

25
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Okay.

26
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,160
When you get into your car,

27
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:09,040
I'll send you safely to the intelligence station of Shanghai's underground party.

28
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,360
This is the confidential file I brought from the code research institute.

29
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,920
You must send it to them.

30
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:19,120
Our leader is waiting for you there.

31
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Comrade Byun,

32
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,680
we can't wait any longer.

33
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,560
Let's go!

34
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,640
Wait!

35
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,480
This way.

36
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,600
Hurry up!

37
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,200
This is the way to the country.

38
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,280
The car will arrive soon.

39
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,360
You should leave as soon as you arrive.

40
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,440
Don't worry about me.

41
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,760
Do you have a gun?

42
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,440
Won't you go with me?

43
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,920
We have an important mission.

44
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
The car is here.

45
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,840
Comrade, see you in Yan'an.

46
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:37,960
Yan'an?

47
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,040
Yan...

48
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,120
Don't look back!

49
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
No!

50
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Let's go.

51
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Yan'an.

52
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Yan'an.

53
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:24,960
Gu Xiaoshan.

54
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,040
Don't say anything.

55
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,520
I know what you're doing.

56
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,040
Where do you want to go with us?

57
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,200
I'm excited for you.

58
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,000
I'm sure you want to go with us.

59
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,120
This is an endurance.

60
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,240
Yeah.

61
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,320
This is a training.

62
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,240
We have all got an Prize.

63
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:40,560
You know,

64
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,200
according to my terms of excellence

65
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,920
you can do anything you want.

66
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,440
So I'm quickly cutting it loose.

67
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,840
Yan Yanzhang killed my brother

68
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,400
and gets Tara掉ed too.

69
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,040
This is a lie.

70
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,360
The point is 3 years prior.

71
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,640
It's a dead end.

72
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,760
If we have a chance to see Zuo Zuo Mu,

73
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,600
we can prove to him that Liang Jing Yuan is a man of his word.

74
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,840
Because the bowman is his man.

75
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,040
You're too naive.

76
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,960
Why would Liang Jing Yuan let you see Zuo Zuo Mu?

77
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,640
He won't let you see Zuo Zuo Mu.

78
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,880
My son.

79
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,720
My son.

80
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,280
My son.

81
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,840
Liang Jing Yuan.

82
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,840
You bastard.

83
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,920
Right now.

84
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,960
I'll make a three-line bow.

85
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,040
So, the next battle will be a psychological battle.

86
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,760
Zuo Zuo Mu won't give Liang Jing Yuan much time.

87
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,760
As long as we can prove to him that he's a man of his word,

88
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,080
he won't be able to find any evidence from us.

89
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:59,640
Liang Jing Yuan will have to swallow the last bitter fruit.

90
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:06,760
Give me one night.

91
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,680
I'll give you one night.

92
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,840
I've already taken control of the three-line bow.

93
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,680
I'll apply for a contract with Li Yue Se.

94
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:23,800
You know the result, right?

95
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
You have some nerve, Pshwio.

96
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,080
I don't.

97
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,920
I don't see any evidence from the culprit's family.

98
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,320
Can the suspect prove it to us?

99
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,800
Watch the decision.

100
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,360
I have the memorandum of the last degree.

101
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,120
I read it.

102
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,120
I will do my best to protect you.

103
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:57,120
But if you don't find any communists by the morning,

104
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:02,120
the people of the lab will not be left alone.

105
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,120
You should also be careful.

106
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,120
Since you have such a perfect plan,

107
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,120
you don't need me anymore.

108
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,120
You have made the decision you wanted.

109
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,120
Don't worry.

110
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,120
I didn't kill Shen Wenjing.

111
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,120
I won't betray her.

112
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,120
I will return what I owe you.

113
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,120
I will return what I owe you.

114
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,120
Mr. Shen! Mr. Shen!

115
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,120
Mr. Shen!

116
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,120
Mr. Shen!

117
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,120
Mr. Shen!

118
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,120
Be careful.

119
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,120
Mr. Shen!

120
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,120
Mr. Shen, listen to me.

121
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,120
I've already dealt with you and the radio station.

122
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,120
I told Iida to kill the Japanese with your radio station.

123
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,120
I told her to make her public identity.

124
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,120
But Iida is a member of Liang's team.

125
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,120
She will immediately seal off Sanya.

126
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,120
We will investigate this matter.

127
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,120
As long as we can hold the interrogation and reveal any flaws,

128
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,120
we will have a chance to turn the tables.

129
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,120
We will be able to send her out.

130
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:55,120
Mr. Shen, I'm not Li Yuece.

131
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:59,120
I'm Ding Yi, an actor from Chaosheng.

132
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:04,120
Miss Xian, Xian Biyun, is my introduction.

133
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,120
The Japanese are coming!

134
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,120
Close the door!

135
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,120
Comrade Bai Ye, don't hesitate.

136
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,120
I've already given you all the information I have.

137
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:19,120
Now you must believe me.

138
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:49,120
Come on.

139
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:48,120
Come on, come on.

140
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,120
Director Li.

141
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,120
Director Li.

142
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,120
Mr. Shen, you're here too.

143
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,120
What's going on?

144
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,120
Director Yang.

145
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,120
Interesting.

146
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:15,120
The radio station has found its home.

147
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:19,120
The place where the password was found was a ghost.

148
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,120
How many people will be unable to sleep tonight

149
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:25,120
in the Japanese headquarters of Shanghai?

150
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,120
My head,

151
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,120
and everyone's fate,

152
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,120
will depend on the investigation results tonight.

153
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,120
Come on.

154
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,120
I want to hear your suggestions.

155
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,120
Who is the ghost?

156
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,120
Who has the radio station?

157
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,120
Who is the ghost?

158
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,120
Go and check the radio station.

159
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,120
You're right.

160
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:01,120
The radio station is in Miss Ye's hands.

161
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,120
But she's not.

162
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:07,120
Someone has deceived her trust.

163
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,120
Someone has deceived her trust.

164
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,120
Someone has deceived her trust.

165
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:15,120
She left Sanyang Li with the radio station.

166
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,120
This spy is very cunning.

167
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,120
Director Liang, do you have any evidence

168
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,120
to prove that she's not that spy?

169
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,120
Because I believe her.

170
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,120
It's that simple.

171
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,120
Only you are in Sanyang Li tonight.

172
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:36,120
The radio signal from the car is 6.03 p.m.

173
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:40,120
I want to ask you what you're doing at this time.

174
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,120
Director Liang, are you interrogating her?

175
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,120
I'm just asking.

176
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,120
If you don't cooperate,

177
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,120
you can also treat her as an interrogation.

178
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,120
I'm at home.

179
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,120
I'm reading the work draft today.

180
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:00,120
I'm going to sleep.

181
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:03,120
Li Huan and I are resting at home.

182
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,120
I came back from the hospital.

183
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,120
I'm going to help Biyun pack up.

184
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,120
I'm going to send her to the hospital.

185
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,120
Director Liang, you're coming.

186
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,120
What about you?

187
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,120
Director Liang,

188
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:25,120
I asked Mr. Li for leave this morning.

189
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,120
I caught a cold and asked him to rest at home.

190
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,120
But I'm lying in bed.

191
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:34,120
Mr. Li suddenly came back and said that my wife was shot.

192
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:37,120
I quickly helped Mr. Li pack up.

193
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,120
That's it.

194
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,120
Director Liang, can you hurry up?

195
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:49,120
My wife is still in the hospital.

196
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,120
So you don't have a suspect.

197
00:15:56,120 --> 00:16:00,120
I'll have to wait for you here.

198
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:04,120
I'll report to you at any time.

199
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:07,120
Amu, take Li Yu back.

200
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,120
What do you mean?

201
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,120
Why did you catch me?

202
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,120
What are you doing?

203
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,120
Why did you catch me?

204
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,120
I'm not a ghost.

205
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,120
Come back.

206
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,120
Why did you catch me?

207
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,120
Let go of me.

208
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,120
Director Liang.

209
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,120
Don't worry.

210
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:27,120
There will be opportunities in the future.

211
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,120
Of course.

212
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:33,120
I welcome you to knock on the door of the room.

213
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,120
I'll be there.

214
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,120
I'll be there at any time.

215
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,120
You're so stupid.

216
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:42,120
I'm going to the hospital to see my wife.

217
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,120
Charlie, let's go.

218
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:47,120
If you're in a hurry, I'll send someone to pick up your wife.

219
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,120
Do you think it's okay?

220
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,120
Director Liang.

221
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,120
Director Liang.

222
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:07,120
You know me.

223
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:09,120
Li Huan and I were at home all night.

224
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:12,120
Can you prove it?

225
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,120
I...

226
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,120
I...

227
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:23,120
I didn't leave my desk all night.

228
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,120
Sit.

229
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,120
I'm sorry.

230
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,120
Do you want coffee?

231
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,120
I'm sorry.

232
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,120
Let's start.

233
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,120
What do you mean?

234
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,120
What do you mean?

235
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,120
Go away.

236
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,120
Come on!

237
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,120
Director!

238
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,120
Director!

239
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,400
Don't hit him!

240
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,440
Don't hit him!

241
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,600
Mr. Liang!

242
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,120
Mr. Liang!

243
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,120
Don't hit my brother!

244
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,560
He doesn't know anything!

245
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,400
He's not a spy like you said!

246
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,240
No! Don't hit him!

247
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,040
Brother!

248
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,160
Brother!

249
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,280
Mr. Liang!

250
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,800
He's a kid, Mr. Liang!

251
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,360
Mr. Liang!

252
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,280
I'm not a ghost!

253
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,360
Don't hit him!

254
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,440
Mr. Liang!

255
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,400
Don't hit him!

256
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:18,080
You can't do this, Mr. Liang!

257
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,480
Mr. Liang!

258
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,920
Mr. Liang!

259
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,120
Brother!

260
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,400
You can't do this, Mr. Liang!

261
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,400
Mr. Liang!

262
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,720
Dad!

263
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,680
Dad!

264
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,520
Dad!

265
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,840
Brother!

266
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,240
What happened?

267
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,240
Yuyang!

268
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,520
Yuyang!

269
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,760
Brother!

270
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,080
Yuyang!

271
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,800
Go away!

272
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:36,880
Yuyang!

273
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:37,880
Go away!

274
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,000
Yuyang!

275
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:42,960
Yuyang!

276
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,000
Go away!

277
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,080
Yuyang!

278
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,280
Dad!

279
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,440
Dad!

280
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,480
Dad!

281
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,560
Dad!

282
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,640
Dad!

283
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,720
Dad!

284
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:54,800
Dad!

285
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,040
Liang Xingyuan!

286
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,640
You're a traitor!

287
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,800
I'm going to sue you!

288
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,200
Don't worry, Mr. Liang.

289
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,320
I've cleaned up.

290
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,120
It's your turn.

291
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,760
One hundred percent!

292
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:35,840
Do you know when the afin tierra

293
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:38,160
began to suspect you?

294
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,880
When the two words

295
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,320
were said,

296
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,720
right after we first met.

297
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,720
Mr. Li has been living abroad for so many years,

298
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,720
and he knows the Chinese language of the ancient world.

299
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:52,720
He is from the North.

300
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:59,720
And he was the one who brought Xian Biyun to Sanyang.

301
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,720
Mr. Zhou!

302
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:06,720
Mr. Zhou!

303
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,720
Mr. Zhou!

304
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,720
I know this woman.

305
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,720
She would never marry you for money.

306
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,720
But I'm curious.

307
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,720
What do you like about her?

308
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,720
Are you blind?

309
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,720
You invited me here.

310
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,720
Are you going to listen to our love story?

311
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,720
I can tell you clearly.

312
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,720
My love story is very miserable.

313
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,720
Because my fiancee is still lying on the bed.

314
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,720
She is dying, and you are holding me.

315
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:07,720
Liang Jingyuan, as a son of the great emperor,

316
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,720
you suspect me of being a bowman.

317
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,720
This is a great humiliation to the Dongyue Temple family.

318
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:20,720
I'm telling you, I will never cooperate with you.

319
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,720
I'm going to see the Great Sage now.

320
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:26,720
No problem.

321
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,720
But before you tell me, you can't see the Great Sage.

322
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,720
You are the Great Sage.

323
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,720
What do you want to do?

324
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,720
You said it was the Great Sage's will.

325
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,720
As long as you cooperate, I won't make it difficult for you.

326
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,720
But to be honest,

327
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,720
I especially want to see you cooperate.

328
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:08,720
It's a deal.

329
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,720
Next, I'll tell you my guess.

330
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,720
If there is anything wrong, please correct it.

331
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,720
I'll tell you.

332
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:25,720
The Great Sage received the news that the bowman would be at the exchange.

333
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:30,720
But when I arrived at the exchange, I saw Xian Biyun and you.

334
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:34,720
But it doesn't matter.

335
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:39,720
Whether it was the previous exchange or the subsequent inspection,

336
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,720
it was a part of my secret search for the Great Sage.

337
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:46,720
But I didn't expect that Baiye was so cunning.

338
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,720
He should know that I was looking for him.

339
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,720
So he deliberately hid his secret.

340
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:59,720
But I believe that a Communist Party will not give up another Communist Party.

341
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,720
Although I didn't find Baiye,

342
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,720
it's good to find this street person.

343
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,720
Suoxing.

344
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:16,720
I made Yi Aida look like Baiye.

345
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:21,720
He showed up in front of you several times and took your street.

346
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:27,720
But I didn't expect that there was a blackout in Sanyang tonight.

347
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:32,720
Baiye is really in our secret research institute.

348
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,720
He must be anxious to wait for his street man.

349
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,720
And you are just playing the blind for him, right?

350
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:44,720
Then I want to ask.

351
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,720
The Baiye you just mentioned,

352
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:56,720
when he reported, my fiancee was in the hospital.

353
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,720
And I'm a blind man.

354
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,720
I can't see anything.

355
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,720
How can I cover him?

356
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,720
But you're right.

357
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,720
You can't see.

358
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,720
But he's in the car.

359
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,720
According to you,

360
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:16,720
the son of Dongyuan Temple is a public butterfly.

361
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,720
Is it difficult to say if they are a family?

362
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,720
Yes.

363
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,720
Yiyun is still my fiancee.

364
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:38,720
But they are not a family.

365
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,720
You know, I didn't mean that.

366
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:53,720
I found out that the man who was using the name of Mrs. Li to make a public butterfly was a chicken egg.

367
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,720
Director Li.

368
00:27:58,720 --> 00:27:59,720
Look.

369
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:04,720
Director Li.

370
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,720
I want to ask you about the thing you made.

371
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:23,720
I found something interesting in your house.

372
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,720
I found a picture of you and your fiancee.

373
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:05,720
I found a picture of you and your fiancee.

374
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,720
I found a picture of you and your fiancee.

375
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:13,720
I found a picture of you and your fiancee.

376
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,720
I found a picture of you and your fiancee.

377
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,720
I found a picture of you and your fiancee.

378
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,720
I found a picture of you and your fiancee.

379
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,720
If you are a real couple,

380
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,720
you sleep in the same bed every night.

381
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:36,720
Why is there only one side of the bed with a good heart?

382
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,720
And the other side is as flat as a star and has never slept.

383
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:45,720
Don't tell me you sleep together.

384
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,720
I said.

385
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:58,720
Director Li, please give me a reasonable explanation.

386
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:29,720
What they want is my thing.

387
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:34,720
I will take it from you.

388
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,720
No!

389
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,720
Director Liang is really careful.

390
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:02,720
Biyun and I did not sleep on the same bed.

391
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,720
I'm a Christian.

392
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,720
I can't be punished before the wedding.

393
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:25,720
Christian?

394
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,720
No problem.

395
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,720
Then why did you want to kill him?

396
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:32,720
I wanted to kill him.

397
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:36,720
Then why did you deliberately create the illusion of your cohabitation?

398
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:40,720
The bathroom has the same toiletries as you two.

399
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:47,720
Did Mrs. Li teach you to do this?

400
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,720
At first, I did sleep with Biyun.

401
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:54,720
Men...

402
00:31:54,720 --> 00:32:03,720
I moved to Charlie's room to protect the bottom line from Lu Feifei's moment.

403
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:10,720
As for the traces of my life in Biyun's bathroom, it's normal.

404
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:15,720
Charlie's room has his bathroom, and my towel.

405
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,720
Mr. Li, you're very thoughtful.

406
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:29,720
But it doesn't matter.

407
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:32,720
You still have a long night.

408
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:34,720
Take your time.

409
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,720
The wedding is coming.

410
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:48,720
Mr. Li,

411
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:50,720
I'm sorry.

412
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:52,720
I'm sorry.

413
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:54,720
Mr. Li.

414
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,720
Mr. Li, are you okay?

415
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:04,720
It's my turn.

416
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,720
To tell the truth,

417
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,720
the Lord will bless you.

418
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:23,720
I'm sorry.

419
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:42,720
Mr. Liang,

420
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,720
sit down.

421
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:53,720
Sit down.

422
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,720
You're not feeling well. Have some water.

423
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:03,720
Sit down.

424
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:14,720
I'll be straight with you.

425
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:18,720
How much salary did Mr. Li pay you in a month?

426
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:21,720
Mr. Liang, why do you ask?

427
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:30,720
I just want to know how much money can buy a loyal man like you.

428
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,720
I want to take revenge.

429
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:42,720
Huan.

430
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:44,720
Huan.

431
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:47,720
Your brother is gone.

432
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:51,720
You have to live on.

433
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:53,720
You have to live on.

434
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:01,720
Do you remember what I told you?

435
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,720
Listen to me.

436
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:19,720
Huan.

437
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:35,720
Huan.

438
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:49,720
Huan.

439
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:19,720
You can't keep it.

440
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:25,720
Thank you, Mr. Liang.

441
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,720
You're talking nonsense, aren't you?

442
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,720
I didn't expect to be so unlucky.

443
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:35,720
I want to ask for a knife and a hammer.

444
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:41,720
Sit down.

445
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:43,720
Sit down.

446
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,720
I want to tell you something.

447
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:54,720
I've been a member of the R&D department for a long time.

448
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:56,720
But...

449
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:01,720
We can't just let Mr. Li take the hat of the Communist Party.

450
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:03,720
He can't even see it.

451
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:05,720
How can he send a telegram?

452
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:06,720
What about Xing Biyun?

453
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:09,720
They have a lot of secrets.

454
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,720
If they tell you everything,

455
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:15,720
you'll be involved.

456
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:21,720
If they keep it a secret,

457
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,720
you can't tell me.

458
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:24,720
I'm an outsider.

459
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:31,720
What do you think is strange about some details in your life?

460
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:42,720
Mr. Liang, what do you think is strange?

461
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:44,720
Are you close to each other?

462
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:45,720
Yes.

463
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:46,720
Close?

464
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:47,720
Of course.

465
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:53,720
Before you came, you used to eat, sleep, go to the bathroom.

466
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:54,720
I used to take care of you.

467
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,720
I was always with you.

468
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:59,720
But you came and I became a part of it.

469
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:01,720
Do you quarrel?

470
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:03,720
Yes, we do.

471
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:07,720
A Chinese man and a British man have different thoughts.

472
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:09,720
What time do you get up and when do you go to bed?

473
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,720
It's not sure.

474
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:14,720
Most of the time, I go to bed early.

475
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:18,720
Mr. Li works, so I sleep late.

476
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,720
Mr. Li has a brain disease.

477
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:24,720
Will it affect Mrs. Li's rest?

478
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:32,720
Mr. Liang, I was told that it was after he closed the door.

479
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,720
How can I know?

480
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:35,720
I have to know.

481
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:42,720
I have to know.

482
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,720
Mr. Liang, let me think.

483
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:45,720
Let me think.

484
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:46,720
To be honest, the Lord will bless you.

485
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:51,720
I'll tell you the truth.

486
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:53,720
They didn't live in the same room.

487
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:55,720
How do you know?

488
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,720
Mr. Li believes in this.

489
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:01,720
He is a Christian.

490
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:03,720
He couldn't have slept with Mrs. Li before the wedding.

491
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:05,720
He lived with me.

492
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:07,720
He was a Christian.

493
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:09,720
He was a Christian.

494
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:10,720
He lived with Mrs. Li before the wedding.

495
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,720
He lived with me.

496
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:16,720
But he couldn't tell anyone about this.

497
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:19,720
Everyone thought they loved each other.

498
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:21,720
Why didn't they live in the same room?

499
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,720
Is there a problem with that place?

500
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:24,720
Is he still alive?

501
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:27,720
So he didn't tell anyone.

502
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:33,720
Mr. Liang, I'm willing to do anything to help you.

503
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:35,720
But don't tell anyone that I told you.

504
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:37,720
Otherwise, I can't be a Charlie.

505
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,720
Mr. Liang,

506
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:48,720
I don't know if this is a strange detail.

507
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:41,720
Mr. Li.

508
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:42,720
Charlie.

509
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,720
I'm back.

510
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:48,720
Be careful.

511
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,720
I don't want to make a mess with you.

512
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:13,720
Now the bow is locked between you and Li Yue-se.

513
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:16,720
Tell me.

514
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:19,720
Is it him or you?

515
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:22,720
Mr. Liang.

516
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:25,720
I don't know if you can

517
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:30,720
lock the bandages between me and Li Yue-se.

518
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,720
But I can tell you for sure.

519
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,720
This person must not be me.

520
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:37,720
You know, I'm a coward.

521
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:40,720
And I'm not very smart.

522
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:44,720
My hobbies are small things.

523
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:48,720
I'm very satisfied with my position.

524
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:52,720
I want to do something in our institute.

525
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,720
I have nothing to ask for.

526
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:58,720
The bow is too big.

527
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:00,720
I can't stand it.

528
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:04,720
You were not in the institute when you were on the street.

529
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:08,720
You were in Sanya when you were on the newspaper.

530
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:12,720
Why did you meet so many coincidences?

531
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,720
You were not in the institute today.

532
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:19,720
Don't tell me you went to the temple in the daytime.

533
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:27,720
I did have a secret plan.

534
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:31,720
I did have a secret plan.

535
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:59,720
Through the eyes,

536
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:03,720
the weak one is swaying.

537
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:06,720
Flowers are blooming.

538
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:10,720
The strong body is turning into a map.

539
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:13,720
When the day breaks,

540
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:17,720
the first light will light up my way.

541
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:20,720
The house is lost.

542
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:24,720
There is no direction and no way out.

543
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:28,720
The pain in the eyes,

544
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:32,720
the fake play, the real person, I can't tell.

545
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:35,720
Where is the wind going?

546
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:39,720
Whose window is shaking?

547
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:42,720
The heart is thinking,

548
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:46,720
whether it's you or me.

549
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:49,720
It's watching,

550
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:53,720
the night is long.

551
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:56,720
The tears are falling.

552
00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:00,720
The wound is falling.

553
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:03,720
It's watching,

554
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:07,720
the shadow is wandering.

555
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:10,720
The night is falling.

556
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:14,720
The night is cold.

557
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:17,720
It's watching,

558
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:21,720
the night is long.

559
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:24,720
The tears are falling.

560
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:28,720
The wound is falling.

561
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:31,720
It's watching,

562
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:35,720
the shadow is wandering.

563
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:38,720
The night is falling.

564
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:42,720
The night is cold.

565
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:45,720
The night is falling.

566
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:50,720
The night is cold.

567
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:54,720
