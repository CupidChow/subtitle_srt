00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The Long Ballad

2
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Gu Yangshan.

4
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
He has been working at the SID in Chongqing and the US for the past few years.

5
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
After he returned to Shanghai,

6
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
he did not participate in the real cleaning and cleaning of the property.

7
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
The Gu family is now in a difficult position.

8
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Meng Mingyi is a famous traitor.

9
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I'm afraid the Gu family can't handle this.

10
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
We should wait for the news from the organization.

11
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
There's no time to wait.

12
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
The SID wakes up at noon every day.

13
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
And Miss Meng is on the list of the group's wake-up calls.

14
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Now, except for Gu Yangshan,

15
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,000
we all have no way to get Miss Meng out of the hands of the SID in one day.

16
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Miss Meng saved my life several times.

17
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I can't just watch her die like this.

18
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
But Gu Yangshan was so embarrassed when he left.

19
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Are you sure he will see you?

20
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I believe him.

21
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Gu Yangshan

22
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Gu Yangshan

23
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
How is it going, mom?

24
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Young Master,

25
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
the SID just came to say that they had been to the Meng family.

26
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
But there's no one there.

27
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
He's going to the SID to check

28
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
if Miss Meng has been arrested.

29
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
If you have any news, tell me right away.

30
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
And

31
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
a man with sunglasses is looking for you.

32
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
He said his surname is Ding.

33
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
He heard that Master was sick.

34
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
He asked me to give this to you.

35
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
He left.

36
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
He left.

37
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
He left.

38
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Okay, mom, I got it. You can go ahead.

39
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Gu Yangshan

40
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Where's Chief Cao?

41
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
He just went out.

42
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
How is Commander Gu?

43
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
He's fine.

44
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Chief Dai and Chief Mao Fu

45
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
are very concerned about Commander Gu's health.

46
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
They all said they were going to visit the east gate.

47
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I'm afraid I'll bother Commander Gu.

48
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Tell them to call me as soon as they see you.

49
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
It's not a good thing.

50
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I want to ask you.

51
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
What's going on with this list?

52
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
The country knows its enemies.

53
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
We have to kill them.

54
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Is there a problem?

55
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
No problem.

56
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
If it's really a traitor, he should be killed.

57
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
But Meng Jie is a public official who did this.

58
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Why did he appear on this list?

59
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Gu Yangshan

60
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
You forgot.

61
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
The senior officials have already decided.

62
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Our assassination operation has failed.

63
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
A failed operation is not a public official.

64
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
As the son of Commander Gu

65
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
you've been a great man for so many years.

66
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Why are you still a public official?

67
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Isn't it because you have a great influence

68
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
during your work in Shanghai?

69
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Now Commander Gu has retired.

70
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
You must not investigate his relationship with the traitors.

71
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Besides

72
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
his father died.

73
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
It's of no value to you.

74
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Why do you want to be your own future for him?

75
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
It must be valuable

76
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
to live.

77
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Otherwise

78
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
why did you think everyone

79
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
didn't save me

80
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
and care about Liang Jinyuan?

81
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Where did you get this?

82
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
It looks like a candy bite.

83
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
You dug it out yourself?

84
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
You never listen to me.

85
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
You should ask Commander Cao

86
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
about these books and paintings.

87
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
You know

88
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I'm not interested in these things.

89
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I'm sorry.

90
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Long time no see.

91
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Long time no see.

92
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I meant to see you.

93
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
In front of me.

94
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
You were in this room.

95
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
As soon as you came in

96
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
you wanted to fight me.

97
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Yes.

98
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
But these five years

99
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
you've changed a lot.

100
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
You haven't changed at all

101
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
these five years.

102
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Really?

103
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Here you are.

104
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I'll do it in a few days.

105
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I'll keep the position

106
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
of the groom for you.

107
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Come on.

108
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
You finally got what you wanted.

109
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Congratulations.

110
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
But before the wedding

111
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
you have to save Miss Meng first.

112
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Saving Miss Meng

113
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
is your party's idea, right?

114
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
No.

115
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
It's my wife's idea.

116
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
She said Miss Meng is our benefactor.

117
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
So she has to be there on the wedding day.

118
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
All right.

119
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Don't lie to me.

120
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Your people have been in touch with me these years.

121
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I can tell if you're acting.

122
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Besides, the list of stars of the Sujian Security Council

123
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
will not be public.

124
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
So if no one reports to you

125
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
how can you know the time?

126
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Don't ask me

127
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
who provided me with the information.

128
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Even if you wear a headscarf

129
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
and tie me to the ten yellow fish outside the Meixin Theater,

130
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I won't tell you a word.

131
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
All right.

132
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
But no matter who it is,

133
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
thank him for me.

134
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Actually, I know why you went to the orphanage to find me.

135
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
But the Gu family now

136
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
is not as good as before.

137
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I just went to Shanghai station

138
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
and bumped into a soft nail.

139
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
So it's not as easy as I thought to save Miss Meng.

140
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
But you have a way out, right?

141
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Yes.

142
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
But I need your help.

143
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Of course.

144
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I saw a light-colored bottle of Tang Yue Yao in Mr. Cao's office today.

145
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
It's worth a lot.

146
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,000
And I happened to see this bottle in Meng's house many years ago.

147
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Today it suddenly appeared in Shanghai station.

148
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
It must be Mr. Cao's name for cleaning up the miscarriage.

149
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
He's going to report to the police and take the blame.

150
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I'm sorry.

151
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I'm sorry.

152
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
If there is one, there will be a second and a third.

153
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Mr. Cao.

154
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
But the security of the warehouse of the miscarriage committee

155
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
is managed by the Commander of the Shanghai Command.

156
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Liu Changdong, who is currently working as the commander,

157
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
is my father's old uncle.

158
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I'll let him get the evidence.

159
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
So next, it's up to you.

160
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
What do you need us to do?

161
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Report it.

162
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I know that your party's emergency services are very influential in Shanghai.

163
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Now is the critical moment for the formal two parties to negotiate.

164
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
The Chief of Staff is about to kill Ji Jinghou.

165
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
So once he knows the evidence of the miscarriage committee and Su Jian Committee's joint corruption,

166
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:22,000
he will be able to force the criminal to re-examine.

167
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Do you know what you're talking about?

168
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I know.

169
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
We still have 12 hours.

170
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
The Meteorological Bureau should be on the way to send the photos.

171
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I'll have to trouble you to give the photos to your superior later.

172
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
And ask them to send the photos to the newspaper.

173
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
So, at six in the morning,

174
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I think these photos will spread across the streets of Shanghai.

175
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
If nothing goes wrong, I guess at around ten o'clock,

176
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
someone will call the Chief of Staff in Shanghai.

177
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I've always seen your party's work.

178
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I think you can do it.

179
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
If you let them know you're doing this,

180
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
it's treason.

181
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I'm sorry.

182
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
But the ones who betrayed the three-democracy first

183
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
were them.

184
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I was wrong just now.

185
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
You've changed over the past five years.

186
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
And you've changed a lot.

187
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I don't care about my father's will to leave.

188
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I can finally walk the same path as you.

189
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I've always been on the wrong path.

190
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
If I don't turn around,

191
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I'll die alone in the desert of life.

192
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
No one will shed tears for me.

193
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I'm sorry.

194
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Father!

195
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Father!

196
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Father!

197
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
My daughter.

198
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Father!

199
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Call me Father now!

200
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
When I was helping a Japanese,

201
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
so many of my fellow men

202
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
died in the desert of life.

203
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
They were all killed.

204
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I'm sorry.

205
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Father!

206
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Father!

207
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Father!

208
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I've helped a Chinese.

209
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I've helped a Japanese.

210
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I've helped a Japanese.

211
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Father, you went to ask Brother Shi.

212
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
You went to find Brother Shi.

213
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
He helped me.

214
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I didn't lie to you.

215
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
You helped a Japanese.

216
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I helped a Japanese.

217
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I was in the front line, bleeding.

218
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
You were still with your father.

219
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I was still with my father.

220
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I was still with my father.

221
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I was still with my father.

222
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
You were still with your brother.

223
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
You were still in the house of San Yang.

224
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
You were still in the house of San Yang.

225
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
That's what a Japanese is.

226
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
What am I?

227
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
No!

228
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
No!

229
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
You're mistaken.

230
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I'm really helping them.

231
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I'm helping a man named Li Yue Sen.

232
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I'm helping him to cover up.

233
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
He has a wife named Xian Biyun.

234
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
They are all Japanese.

235
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I didn't lie to you.

236
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I didn't lie to you.

237
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Li Yue Sen and Xian Biyun are communists.

238
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
If that's true,

239
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
you're not only foreign,

240
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
but also a communist.

241
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I didn't.

242
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Girl.

243
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Girl, don't say it.

244
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I'm sorry.

245
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I've caused you trouble.

246
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Dad.

247
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Dad!

248
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Dad!

249
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Dad!

250
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Dad!

251
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Dad!

252
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Dad!

253
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Stop!

254
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Dad!

255
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Dad!

256
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Dad!

257
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Dad!

258
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
What are you doing, Gu Yaoshan?

259
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Dad!

260
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Dad!

261
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Dad!

262
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Dad!

263
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Dad!

264
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
You killed her father

265
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
in front of her.

266
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Do you have any humanity?

267
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Foreign traitors,

268
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
pig dogs,

269
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
do you still want to find a place?

270
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Shoot!

271
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Brother,

272
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
don't move.

273
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Gu Yaoshan,

274
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
do you want to stop the law?

275
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I'm telling you,

276
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Mengjie, I have to take her away today.

277
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Then try it.

278
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Come on.

279
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Shoot.

280
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
You try it too.

281
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Chief Lu.

282
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
We just received

283
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
the special order from the chief.

284
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
He asked us to review these orders

285
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
in public.

286
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
To stop all the cases,

287
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
we immediately stop the execution.

288
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
It's okay.

289
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
These days,

290
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
you are the one who always has to suffer.

291
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I will help you with the preparation

292
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
of the material to be sent to the court.

293
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Get in the car.

294
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,040
I'm going to fight him déadeole Frost Dragon Hurts

295
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:15,920
F bu

296
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,920
No!

297
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,920
No!

298
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,920
Mengjie

299
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,920
Mengjie

300
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,920
Mengjie

301
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,920
Let me go

302
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,920
Let me go

303
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,920
Mengjie

304
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,920
Luo, look at this

305
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,920
Two days ago

306
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,920
We just checked the Meng family's property

307
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,920
Today, these red items

308
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,920
say that we are loyal and honest

309
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,920
And you said that Su Jian

310
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,920
and Wei Yan Gui

311
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,920
beat Zhongliang into traitors

312
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,920
just to take away

313
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,920
their property

314
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,920
Isn't that ridiculous?

315
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,920
I'm going to check this newspaper

316
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,920
What's the use of checking it now?

317
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,920
They have solid evidence

318
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,920
Take a good look at the photos

319
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,920
We wanted to show our faces

320
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,920
but we didn't expect to show our asses

321
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,920
Aren't you ashamed?

322
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,920
We are not going to show our real property

323
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,920
We are going to show our real property

324
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,920
We are not going to show our real property

325
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,920
We are not going to show our real property

326
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,920
How did they get the photos

327
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,920
of the property committee?

328
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,920
Vice-President, we are in Shanghai

329
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,920
When will the mayor of Shanghai

330
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,920
take the responsibility

331
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,920
and give us a beating?

332
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,920
And the Communist Party

333
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,920
doesn't know about it?

334
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,920
I don't understand

335
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,920
How did you find me?

336
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,920
Report

337
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,920
Come in

338
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,920
Deputy Chief

339
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,920
We sent people to follow Meng Ni

340
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,920
and we got the photos

341
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,920
Please have a look

342
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,920
But they are very cautious

343
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,920
Our people

344
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,920
are lost

345
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,920
It's really him

346
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,920
We got it

347
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,920
Yes

348
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,920
I guessed it right

349
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,920
The person who did this

350
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,920
is not only the Communist Party

351
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,920
but also a thief

352
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,920
How is it?

353
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,920
I only got the medicine

354
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,920
after taking the medicine

355
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,920
I just fell asleep

356
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,920
The best psychiatrist

357
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,920
is in Chaosheng Group now

358
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,920
I'll get him back right away

359
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,920
You were just passing by

360
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,920
Luo Han will not be afraid

361
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,920
And I guess

362
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,920
Chaosheng Group is not necessarily safe

363
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,920
How about this

364
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,920
You take Miss Xian and these doctors

365
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,920
to our house

366
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:40,380
No one dare to search the

367
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:42,380
Imperial Museum until now

368
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:44,380
No, these doctors

369
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:46,380
are very sensitive

370
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:48,380
We can't give you any trouble

371
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:50,380
When you helped me

372
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:52,380
I was afraid of trouble

373
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:54,380
It's different

374
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:56,380
We were barefoot

375
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:58,380
But now

376
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:00,380
you are in your home

377
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:02,380
We can't let your family take the risk

378
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:06,380
Right

379
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,840
It's different

380
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:12,840
But now we are on the same path

381
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,840
Tomorrow

382
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,840
I will send my father to London

383
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,840
to see a doctor

384
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,840
By then

385
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:22,840
I won't have any trouble

386
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,840
It's settled

387
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,840
Listen to me

388
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,840
Tonight I will let the Meteorological Bureau cover you

389
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:37,300
Okay

390
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:44,300
Okay

391
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:46,300
Then do as you say

392
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:54,300
Wait for me

393
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:56,300
to send Bi Yun and these doctors

394
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:58,300
back to Shanghai safely

395
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:04,300
Why do you have to come back?

396
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,760
I have to go

397
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,760
This is my task

398
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,760
To send all the doctors

399
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,760
back to Shanghai safely

400
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,760
But now

401
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,760
There are still some people

402
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,760
who can't be found

403
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:35,220
I can't leave

404
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:37,220
Dingyi, you should know

405
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:39,220
You are more dangerous than these people

406
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:41,220
Luo Hai has killed Hu Yan

407
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:43,220
If he finds you

408
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:45,220
He wants to kill you

409
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:47,220
He doesn't need to wait for him to go to the city

410
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:49,220
That's why I need your help

411
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:51,220
Call me when necessary

412
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:58,220
You must do it

413
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:00,220
I must

414
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:05,220
You are just a moth

415
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:07,220
You haven't changed for five years

416
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:11,220
You used to help Miss Xian without my knowledge

417
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:13,220
Now you are helping me without Miss Xian's knowledge

418
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:17,220
Does Miss Xian know?

419
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:21,220
I can't let her know

420
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:23,220
Don't tell her

421
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:25,220
Or she will be angry

422
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:27,220
and will kill herself

423
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:29,220
It's annoying

424
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:31,220
I want to know

425
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,680
How to deal with you after knowing your plan

426
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,680
By the way

427
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,680
Do you remember

428
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,680
When we were in Sanyang

429
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,680
On my birthday

430
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,680
We took a picture together

431
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,680
Yes

432
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,680
Today is such a happy day

433
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,680
Let's take a picture together

434
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,680
To remember

435
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:03,140
Miss Xian

436
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:05,140
Stand in the middle

437
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:07,140
Just leave me a part

438
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:09,140
I will take care of you

439
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:13,140
The Chinese Communist Party is going to be defeated

440
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:15,140
On September 30th

441
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:17,140
The Nationalist Party Han De

442
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:19,140
issued a warrant

443
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:21,140
to arrest all members of the Communist Party

444
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:23,140
and execute them all

445
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:25,600
The Nationalist Party Han De

446
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,600
I have to

447
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,600
close the camera

448
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,600
in advance

449
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,600
Clean up the mess

450
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,600
Don't let them know we are here

451
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,600
We will leave after we finish the cleaning

452
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,600
The New Year's Eve

453
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,600
The New Year's Eve

454
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,600
The New Year's Eve

455
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:25,060
Come on

456
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:33,060
Come on

457
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:55,060
Come on

458
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:13,060
Father

459
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:15,060
London is often rainy

460
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:17,060
I prepared more clothes for you

461
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:19,060
The doctor has contacted the authorities

462
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:21,060
and ordered them to Wang Ma

463
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,520
Don't worry

464
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,520
You really don't want to go

465
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,520
I will go with me

466
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,520
Yangshan has something to do

467
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,520
We haven't done it yet

468
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,520
We will go to London after we finish

469
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:37,980
This is the property of our Gu family

470
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:53,980
The anti-Japanese army used it

471
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:55,980
and now it's back

472
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:57,980
I think you are not even

473
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:59,980
a member of the government

474
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:01,980
You don't need it

475
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:03,980
I will give it to the government with my own hands

476
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:07,980
The New Year's Eve

477
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:12,980
I will invite you to come home

478
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:14,980
for tea tomorrow

479
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:21,980
Father

480
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:23,980
Is this because I saved Miss Meng?

481
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:31,980
Liang Hongzhi's house

482
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:33,980
is for the White Dragon

483
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,440
Chen Gongbo's house is for Dean Song

484
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,440
Luo Hongyi's property

485
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,440
is for Gu Zhutong

486
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,440
Even your Juntongju Shanghai Station

487
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:46,440
is now

488
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,440
an old and desolate property

489
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:54,440
If you want to live on the other's land

490
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:56,440
you have to follow the rules

491
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:58,900
I will come

492
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:04,900
Father

493
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:06,900
You told me since I was a child

494
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:08,900
My grandfather and my uncles

495
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,900
were defeated in the Great Revolution

496
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:12,900
for the sake of China

497
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:14,900
My uncles

498
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:16,900
were defeated in the Northern France

499
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:18,900
for the sake of China

500
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:20,900
and for the sake of unification

501
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:22,900
and for peace

502
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:24,900
for the sake of the anti-Japanese

503
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,360
and for the sake of the anti-Japanese

504
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,360
Our family has been

505
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,360
passionate about the Three Jewels

506
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,360
not for the sake of these rules

507
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,360
Then what are you going to do?

508
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:48,360
Father

509
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,360
I think

510
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:52,360
someone should stand up

511
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:54,360
and create a new rule

512
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,360
I think

513
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,360
I should stand up

514
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,360
It seems that you have been in Shanghai

515
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,360
for a long time

516
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,360
and you have made good friends

517
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:14,360
The Three Jewels

518
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:16,360
are the path I want you to take

519
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:18,360
But now it seems

520
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:20,360
you have your own path

521
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,360
Father

522
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,360
Your friend

523
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,360
He is here

524
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,360
They are very cautious

525
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,360
They have left our eyes

526
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,360
shortly after we got off the car

527
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,360
But from the map

528
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,360
the two stations they got off

529
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,360
are very close

530
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,360
They are very close

531
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:55,820
They are very close

532
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:57,820
I have buried people around

533
00:32:57,820 --> 00:32:59,820
I can wait for them to show up

534
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:22,820
This is

535
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:25,280
Nanyang Road

536
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:27,280
Gu's Mansion

537
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:29,280
Take your people away

538
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:31,280
and follow me to search Gu's Mansion

539
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:33,280
Gu's Mansion?

540
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:35,280
Yes

541
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,280
Inform Deputy Chief Mao

542
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,280
to tell him

543
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,280
I have got new evidence

544
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:43,280
The Communist Party

545
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:45,280
is hiding in Gu's Mansion

546
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:47,280
and ask him to issue a search warrant

547
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:49,280
But

548
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:51,740
There is no evidence

549
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:52,500
The

550
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:54,500
investigation is in his hands

551
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,500
If we can't find him

552
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,500
the consequences

553
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,500
will be my responsibility

554
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,500
Anyway

555
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,500
I can't let Ding Yi and Gu Yanshan go

556
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:17,500
Ok

557
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:19,720
It's settled

558
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:29,720
Miss Xie

559
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:31,720
Please don't talk

560
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:49,720
I have contacted all of them

561
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:51,720
Liu Jinzhi will drive

562
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:52,720
the police car

563
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:54,720
to come here tonight

564
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:56,720
After you finish the meeting

565
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:58,720
no one will stop you

566
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,720
Thank you

567
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,720
Don't say that

568
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,720
I should thank you

569
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,720
Dr. Lin

570
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,720
has finished the interview

571
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,720
with Mengjie

572
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,720
He said he was shocked

573
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,720
and was very emotional

574
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,720
He said he was shocked

575
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:18,940
He said he was shocked

576
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:20,940
and he couldn't say

577
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:22,940
he was separated from his family

578
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:24,940
But

579
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:26,940
we need to confirm it

580
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:28,940
before we know it

581
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:30,940
Well

582
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:32,940
I haven't asked you

583
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:34,940
how Gu Silin is doing

584
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:36,940
before I came

585
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:42,940
Gan'ai

586
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:44,940
told me

587
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:50,980
that my father had a

588
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:52,980
long-standing illness

589
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:54,980
and he refused to go to the hospital

590
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:56,980
I'm sorry

591
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:58,980
My father's life

592
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:00,980
was a revolution

593
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:02,980
but he ended up

594
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:04,980
living a life of

595
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:06,980
exile

596
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:08,980
What about you?

597
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:10,980
What's your plan?

598
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:12,980
I miss you

599
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:15,020
Ding Yi has missed you

600
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:17,020
He knew you were back in Chongqing

601
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:33,760
and was studying the code of the

602
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:36,540
Because he was lucky

603
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:38,540
and you took him

604
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:40,540
to the right path

605
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:42,540
I believe if I was in his position

606
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:44,540
I would have made

607
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:46,540
the same choice

608
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:48,540
It's a pity

609
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:56,540
I fixed the camera

610
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:58,540
Let's go

611
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:02,540
Let's go

612
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:06,540
Sit

613
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:08,540
It's the same as before

614
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:10,540
I have to follow you

615
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:12,540
I want to see

616
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:14,540
who can run away

617
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:16,540
today

618
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:18,540
OK

619
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:20,540
Come

620
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:22,540
Look here

621
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:26,540
Smile

622
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:28,540
One, two, three

623
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:30,540
One, two, three

624
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:32,540
One, two, three

625
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:35,320
One, two, three

626
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:37,320
What the hell?

627
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:39,320
What a bad camera

628
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:41,320
I've been fixing it for a long time

629
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,320
I fixed it

630
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:45,320
How to use it?

631
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:47,320
No, no, no

632
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:49,320
How to use it?

633
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:51,320
I'm telling you

634
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:53,320
I'm collecting the camera

635
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:55,320
not for taking pictures

636
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:57,320
Young Master

637
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:59,320
What's wrong?

638
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:01,320
Something happened

639
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:04,100
They said they were going to search for Gu's

640
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:14,100
What are you doing?

641
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:16,100
Don't move

642
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:18,100
Who are you?

643
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:20,100
Don't move

644
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:24,100
Let's do this

645
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:26,100
You take the guest in and wait

646
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:28,100
I'll deal with it

647
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:30,100
Be careful

648
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,880
You go in too

649
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,880
This is my house

650
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,880
I can't let them in

651
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,880
You go in first

652
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,880
Young Master, you take them in first

653
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,880
Since they are here

654
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,880
They are Gu's guests

655
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,880
Gu family

656
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,880
doesn't have the principle

657
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,880
to push guests out

658
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,880
Let Quan handle the outside

659
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,880
You follow me

660
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,880
Go

661
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,880
Long Han

662
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,880
Why did you bring so many people to my house?

663
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:19,880
Sorry to bother you

664
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:21,880
I have something to do

665
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,880
What?

666
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,880
I suspect you are hiding traitors

667
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,880
Director Mao has been approved by the committee

668
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:30,660
He ordered me to search all Gu's properties

669
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:32,660
Including Gu's Palace

670
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:38,660
You mean our family

671
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:40,660
is hiding traitors?

672
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:44,660
And you have been approved by the committee

673
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:46,660
to search our house

674
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:50,660
What about the approval?

675
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:52,660
What about the search certificate?

676
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:00,660
I know you are the deputy director

677
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:02,660
You have a job

678
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:04,660
It's normal

679
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:06,660
I can let you lock up our house

680
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:08,660
But you can only enter our house

681
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:10,660
If they want to enter

682
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:12,660
You have to think about the consequences

683
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:17,660
I'll decide the consequences

684
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:21,660
Go

685
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:23,660
Yes

686
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:27,660
You are so rude

687
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:30,440
Let me go

688
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:34,440
Sorry

689
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:36,440
I thought I would kill you

690
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:40,440
Who wants to try?

691
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,440
You are traitors

692
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:46,440
after you shoot us

693
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,440
You are traitors

694
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:50,440
You can't search our house

695
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:52,440
Take out your guns

696
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:54,440
I tell you

697
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:56,440
If anyone shoots you

698
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:59,220
You will be hurt

699
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:05,220
Who?

700
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:09,220
Young master

701
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:11,220
Master said

702
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:13,220
Please let me in

703
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Master

704
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Master

705
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Commander Gu

706
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Sorry

707
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Young master

708
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Since you have a job

709
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Let me search

710
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
I have no shame

711
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
I have no one to see

712
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
I will listen to the party's trial

713
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Yes

714
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:04,780
I have no one to see

715
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:06,780
I will listen to the party's trial

716
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:08,780
Yes

717
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,780
Then I'll let you go

718
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:16,780
Go

719
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:18,780
Yes

720
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:22,780
Close all documents

721
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:24,780
Take them back

722
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:26,780
Yes

723
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:34,780
Yangshan

724
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:36,780
We are fine here

725
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:38,780
We are fine here

726
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:40,780
Take me to the yard

727
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:42,780
Take me to the yard

00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:32,360
When you I'm turning blind

772
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:34,920
Looking

773
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:37,960
Nights long trash

774
00:44:38,740 --> 00:44:40,740
White smoke

775
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:45,960
And the wounds flat

776
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:49,040
Looking

777
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:53,000
And the streetlights

778
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,520
coming and falling

779
00:44:55,520 --> 00:45:00,520
Looking back, it's still dawn

780
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:03,520
Lying in the watch

781
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:07,520
In the vast night

782
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:10,520
Tears are floating

783
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:14,520
A wound that has fallen

784
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:18,520
Lying in the watch

785
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:21,520
Wandering in the shadow

786
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:24,520
The night is dark

787
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:28,520
Looking back, it's still dawn

788
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:31,520
Lying in the watch

789
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:37,520
Looking back, it's still dawn
