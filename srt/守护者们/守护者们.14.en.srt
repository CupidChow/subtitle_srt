1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The End

2
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Dr. Miyamoto, this is the patient's medical record.

3
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
The End

4
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I've never seen a patient so high in the blood pressure.

5
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Even if it's a small tumor, it won't be that high.

6
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Dr. Miyamoto, can you tell me which medical record you're talking about?

7
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
From the beginning.

8
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:27,000
No need. If my eyes are not good, you can tell me directly.

9
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,000
No, no, no. Your medical record is special and it's very useful to me.

10
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:41,000
No, no. Mr. Miyamoto, your medical record is very special and it's very useful to me.

11
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
They're all gone.

12
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
The End

13
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I've lost my sight since that day.

14
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:33,000
But after that, I still have no work every day and night.

15
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Looking at it, you're very tired.

16
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:50,000
No, I'm not tired. I still have to design the most advanced password for the Empire of Japan.

17
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
The End

18
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Dr. Miyamoto, how's the result?

19
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
The pressure of the liver is at its limit.

20
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Moreover, the water-based current is strong and is threatening the brain.

21
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
If the specialist's brain doctor doesn't treat me, I won't have enough strength.

22
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
But he's been working in such a harsh environment.

23
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
It's a miracle.

24
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I think he's a good person.

25
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Dr. Miyamoto, but...

26
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:37,000
If you don't work hard after him, the stimulation will be great and you'll work comfortably.

27
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Thank you, Dr. Miyamoto.

28
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
How can he stay awake at such a high rate?

29
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Gu Yaoshan, lift him up.

30
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Hold him, Gu Yaoshan.

31
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Ertuan.

32
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
The End

33
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Miss Xian, clear the poison for you.

34
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I want to go to the museum.

35
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Press it.

36
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Ertuan.

37
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Hold on.

38
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I'll feed you.

39
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Prepare a spoon of air.

40
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Hit him.

41
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Quickly.

42
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
How's it going?

43
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
The water is too strong.

44
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Feed him again.

45
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Hold on.

46
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Okay.

47
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Okay.

48
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
How's it going?

49
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Clear the poison.

50
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Press it a few times.

51
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Hold on.

52
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Ertuan.

53
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Hold on.

54
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Quickly.

55
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
The water is clear. Give it to me again.

56
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Okay.

57
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I'll do it.

58
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Hold on.

59
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Gu Yaoshan.

60
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Gu Yaoshan.

61
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Gu Yaoshan.

62
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Gu Yaoshan.

63
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
What's wrong?

64
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I can't see anything.

65
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Why can't I see anything?

66
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I'm sorry.

67
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
You can't change two people's lives

68
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
with just one eye.

69
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Don't eat it.

70
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
As long as you're by my side

71
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
and take care of me,

72
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I'm fine.

73
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Even if I'm a poor man,

74
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I'll find a way to cure your eyes.

75
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
If it's not good,

76
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
if it's not good,

77
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I'll always stand on your right.

78
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I'll be your eyes.

79
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
It's too slippery.

80
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
No, no, no.

81
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I feel sick when I look at your eyes.

82
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
It's too slippery.

83
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Give me some water.

84
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I'm a little thirsty.

85
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Are you okay?

86
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
You're crying.

87
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Thank you.

88
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
No need to thank me.

89
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I ate the medicine myself.

90
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
No one forced me.

91
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Give me some water.

92
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Here, here.

93
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Here.

94
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Slowly, slowly.

95
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Slowly.

96
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Slowly.

97
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Where's Miss Xian?

98
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
She was with you all night.

99
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Mengjie said that when you were free,

100
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
she said that she had something to do and left.

101
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Look.

102
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
This.

103
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
She said that she found it for you at the dock.

104
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I'll go.

105
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Miss Xian fixed it for you.

106
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I just saw this world.

107
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
It's so nice.

108
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Miss Xian.

109
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
What are you doing here?

110
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I'm recovering well.

111
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
The doctor said that you can be discharged tomorrow.

112
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
After you're discharged,

113
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
go to the Dado Hotel first.

114
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Lao Wu will pick you up there.

115
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
He has a boat ticket to Hong Kong.

116
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
You go first.

117
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I'll go to the Guiyang Mountain Club with your mother.

118
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
If everything goes well,

119
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
you and your mother will be together.

120
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I'll go with you.

121
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I'll go with you.

122
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Your mother will be able to see you in Hong Kong soon.

123
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I know what you're thinking.

124
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
The Japanese military has withdrawn the five days.

125
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Tomorrow,

126
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
he will go back to his country by boat

127
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
to take the military's investigation.

128
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
If he can't explain the leak of the intelligence,

129
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
he will be executed by the military.

130
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
What are you thinking about?

131
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Nothing.

132
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I'm thinking

133
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
about the Japanese military.

134
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I'm thinking

135
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
if I can't see Miss Xian

136
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
after I leave.

137
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
As long as we walk on the same path,

138
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
we will meet again.

139
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I'm thinking

140
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
about the Japanese military.

141
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I'm thinking

142
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
about the Japanese military.

143
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I'm thinking

144
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
about the Japanese military.

145
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I'm thinking

146
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
about the Japanese military.

147
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I'm thinking

148
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
about the Japanese military.

149
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I'm thinking

150
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
about the Japanese military.

151
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I'm thinking

152
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
about the Japanese military.

153
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I'm thinking

154
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
about the Japanese military.

155
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
You're back.

156
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Miss Xian.

157
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Ding Yu,

158
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
you're going to eat something

159
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
that the boss bought for you.

160
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Ding Yu.

161
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Ding Yu.

162
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Where is he?

163
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Mr. Yi.

164
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I was surprised

165
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
to hear your call.

166
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Whiskey.

167
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Thank you.

168
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
How can you be alone?

169
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Where is Charlie?

170
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Such a good wine.

171
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I feel sorry

172
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
to have a sip.

173
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
That's good.

174
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Come in.

175
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Be careful.

176
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
It's okay.

177
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
It's okay.

178
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
This way.

179
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Go inside.

180
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I brought the painting

181
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
that you just saw

182
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
from the main hall.

183
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
This way.

184
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Sit down.

185
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
If you can see it,

186
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
you'll know

187
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
that it's a painting

188
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
of a girl.

189
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
My house is by the sea.

190
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
When you open the door,

191
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
you can smell the sea breeze.

192
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I was thinking

193
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
about going to the store.

194
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I bought a pair of clothes.

195
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I play the test on the beach every day.

196
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I'm old and free.

197
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I admire your courage.

198
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
You've been to the battlefield.

199
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
You've killed so many people.

200
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
You still have the confidence

201
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
to enjoy the sea breeze.

202
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
It's just a job.

203
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Mr. Li,

204
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
today I came here

205
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
to see you.

206
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Is it true?

207
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
There are only two of us here.

208
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Tell me the truth.

209
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
There is a rule in China.

210
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Only after nine times three rounds

211
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
can you speak the truth.

212
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
It's true.

213
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
There are some words

214
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
that need to be spoken

215
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
after drinking.

216
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Cheers.

217
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
It's good.

218
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Cheers.

219
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
One question for a glass of wine.

220
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
You go first.

221
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Okay.

222
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
You're a man of your word.

223
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Did you tell the British about it?

224
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
No.

225
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Then what's the secret?

226
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
No.

227
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
None.

228
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
How did you reveal it?

229
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Actually, the password of the Lv Yue Village

230
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
is not revealed at all.

231
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
It's very limited.

232
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Then you wait a while.

233
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
The password of Lv Yue Village

234
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
is the most advanced password in the world.

235
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Because the military system can't be broken down,

236
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
so we deliberately

237
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
set up a trap for you.

238
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Let you take the initiative

239
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
to change this password.

240
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I thought this thing

241
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
could be over.

242
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I didn't expect

243
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
you to bite me.

244
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I almost

245
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
was caught by you.

246
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Fortunately, I found

247
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
your private relationship with the Navy.

248
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Chief Takeda is already heading to the station.

249
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
The Navy is also investigating.

250
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
It's a matter of time before the results come out.

251
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Chief Wudiang has already rushed to deal with it.

252
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
The Navy is also...

253
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Coincidentally,

254
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Chief Zuo's target is not worth it.

255
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I...

256
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
So we deliberately let you feel

257
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
that I have to take the British merchant ship

258
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
and escape.

259
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
You have to have the power of the Navy.

260
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
In this way,

261
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
in front of Zuo Zuo Mu,

262
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
you will be able to prove that you colluded with the Navy.

263
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Very good.

264
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I like this.

265
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I like

266
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
what you just said.

267
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
In this way,

268
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I will

269
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
always be true to myself.

270
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I believe very quickly

271
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
that they will give up.

272
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
For your sake.

273
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Thank you for not having a chance.

274
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
You are awake.

275
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Come on.

276
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Impossible.

277
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
In this case,

278
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
you drink it.

279
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Thanks to you,

280
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I just learned

281
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
that a large amount of Permian

282
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
will make you feel trapped and exhausted.

283
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Even dead.

284
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I only drank one cup.

285
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
You have too many problems.

286
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
You should have drunk a lot.

287
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
You have defeated me

288
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
with the power of the Navy.

289
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Why did you kill me?

290
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Because I didn't want to defeat you.

291
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
I just want to kill you.

292
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
You think you can kill me

293
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
just by giving me some medicine?

294
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
This is the last blow.

295
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
You...

296
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
You...

297
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
You...

298
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
You have been in China

299
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
for so many years.

300
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
You are a red sword.

301
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
You are the sea breeze.

302
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
I tell you.

303
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
I will kill you.

304
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,000
You will never be able to kill me.

305
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
This is the last blow.

306
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
You...

307
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
You...

308
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
I will kill you.

309
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
I will kill you.

310
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
I will kill you.

311
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Tonight,

312
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
give me a proper punishment.

313
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Otherwise, I will throw you out.

314
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
I have to go to the mountain.

315
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Take her back.

316
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
I have things to do.

317
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Red sword.

318
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
I will kill Wu Tian.

319
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
I know.

320
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
I have received a computer training.

321
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
I have copied Wu Tian's handwriting

322
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
and left a will on the spot.

323
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Then I pulled the plug from the outside

324
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
and pulled it into the lock.

325
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
I faked it into a secret room

326
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
that no one else could access.

327
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
I have to go.

328
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
I have to go.

329
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
I have to go.

330
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
I have to go.

331
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
I have to go.

332
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
I have to go.

333
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
I have to go.

334
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
I have to go.

335
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
What did Miss Xian give me?

336
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
I don't know.

337
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
When Wu Tian and I were talking,

338
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
I kept looking at the box.

339
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
I thought there must be a ghost in there.

340
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
So I took it out.

341
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
I have to go.

342
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
No wonder Wu Tian was so close to you.

343
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
He wanted to use this recorder

344
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
to record every word you said

345
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
as evidence of his return.

346
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
But he didn't expect you, a blind man,

347
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
to be like a killer to him.

348
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
I'm dead!

349
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Tianyi,

350
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,000
you should talk to us today.

351
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Uncle Gu died in their hands.

352
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
I hate his heart.

353
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
I hate him less than you do.

354
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
But maybe I have a better plan.

355
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
I don't need you to risk it alone.

356
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Tianyi.

357
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Tianyi.

358
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:45,000
I thank you on behalf of Uncle Gu.

359
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Actually, I should thank you.

360
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
If you hadn't lied to me,

361
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
I wouldn't have experienced this in my life.

362
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
I wouldn't have seen this miserable thing.

363
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Did Grandpa Liu see the blood on my body?

364
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
I'm sorry.

365
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
It's over.

366
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
It's all over.

367
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
I will report.

368
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:29,000
The death was estimated to have occurred between 3 and 5 p.m. yesterday.

369
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
The wounds on the abdomen were cut from left to right

370
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
and were in the shape of swords.

371
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,000
So, based on various evidence,

372
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,000
I think it was a suicide.

373
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Is this the same thing?

374
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,000
My brothers and I are both in the middle of the army.

375
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
I don't want to be a family member.

376
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
I'm sorry.

377
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,000
I don't want to be a family member.

378
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Takeda was arrested for the crime of committing suicide

379
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:16,000
because he was afraid of the military court's judgment.

380
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Report to the military.

381
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Yes.

382
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,000
The secret research institute vice president.

383
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Yes.

384
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:38,000
I came to tell you the invitation to the military's Li today.

385
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
With the military's instructions,

386
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:45,000
I cooperated with the business of building a complete information system

387
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,000
and then sent the information to the military.

388
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,000
I also sent the information to the military.

389
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:56,000
In order to spread the influence of the Japanese-Chinese war,

390
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:01,000
the secret research institute of the special headquarters was established.

391
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Report to the headquarters.

392
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Mr. Li, you are the best secret research expert in Shanghai.

393
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,000
I look forward to your work in the secret research institute.

394
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:18,000
I don't think I've agreed to this job yet.

395
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
As for the work situation,

396
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:31,000
I will explain it in detail when Director Yang comes to pick you up later.

397
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Mr. Li, please don't forget the expectations of the emperor.

398
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Excuse me.

399
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Director Yang.

400
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
What do you want?

401
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:55,000
I want to know the truth about the secret research institute of the secret research institute.

402
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:03,000
I want to know the truth about the secret research institute of the secret research institute.

403
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Director Yang.

404
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
What should we do now?

405
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
We don't know the result of the secret research institute.

406
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
We don't know the result.

407
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
We must leave.

408
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
We can't stay here tonight.

409
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
I'll find a way to get a new boat.

410
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Pack up and leave.

411
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Director Yang.

412
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Mr. Li.

413
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
I am Liang Jingyuan.

414
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
I am here to pick you up from the hospital.

415
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Mr. Li, I am sorry.

416
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
I was a little late.

417
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Please forgive me.

418
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Go.

419
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Go.

420
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Go.

421
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Go.

422
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Go.

423
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
I did a task.

424
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
I took a piece of the dough.

425
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
It's okay.

426
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Mr. Li was injured this time.

427
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
It's Wu Tian's fault.

428
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
But please rest assured.

429
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
I will be here for you.

430
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,000
I will never let you get into trouble again.

431
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Then I will rely on you in the future.

432
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
You are welcome.

433
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:25,000
But I should thank you.

434
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
If you hadn't exposed Wu Tian and colluded with the navy,

435
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
I wouldn't have been injured so quickly.

436
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
I didn't realize that

437
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,000
you were so weak, but you could kill people.

438
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
I really admire you.

439
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Thank you.

440
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
I really didn't expect that

441
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Wu Tian and I would fight until the end.

442
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
In the end, I let Mr. Liang

443
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
get away with it.

444
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Get away with it?

445
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
I didn't expect Mr. Li

446
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
to know the history of the public security industry

447
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
after living abroad for so many years.

448
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
The old man from the north...

449
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Mr. Liang,

450
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Mr. Li's mother is a northeaster.

451
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,000
So Mr. Li's Chinese is learned from his mother.

452
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Mr. Liang, did you hear

453
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Mr. Li's Northeaster accent?

454
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
No.

455
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
I know you.

456
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Charlie.

457
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Charlie Goode.

458
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Mr. Liang is really thoughtful.

459
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Before he became the chief of Wu Tian,

460
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
he never noticed such details.

461
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
So he went out.

462
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
I came.

463
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Mr. Li, please get in the car.

464
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Wu Tian.

465
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Mr. Liang,

466
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
what happened?

467
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
The Japanese army

468
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
called a large number of code experts

469
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
to establish a new code research institute

470
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
in order to support the Japanese army

471
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
to surrender to the government.

472
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
We have a comrade who is in Weiman

473
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
named Bai Ye.

474
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
He received the secret order from the central government

475
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,000
and has been infiltrated into this code research institute.

476
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
He has been carrying out

477
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
a scheme to steal the sky and change the world.

478
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
He has been in the middle of the night.

479
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
He has been in the middle of the night.

480
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,000
He has been carrying out a scheme to steal the sky and change the world.

481
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
But we just received the news.

482
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Due to the betrayal of the traitors,

483
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
last month,

484
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,000
a underground connection line in the northeast

485
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
was pulled out by Weiman Police Station.

486
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,000
His superior, Lao Hei, was exposed and sacrificed.

487
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Now the organization

488
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
has lost contact with him.

489
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
The situation is very passive.

490
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Do we know his identity information?

491
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
How to restore the connection?

492
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,000
He has been working for us since the time of the special forces.

493
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
His performance is very good.

494
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
In order to protect him,

495
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
the organization has been keeping a single-line connection with him.

496
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,000
No one knows his identity information except Lao Hei.

497
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,000
We have no photos or files.

498
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
We only know one code name,

499
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Bai Ye.

500
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
What does the organization want me to do?

501
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,000
The head of this code research institute is Liang Jingyuan.

502
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,000
You have a good relationship with his wife, Ye Yin.

503
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
After the research,

504
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
the organization thinks that

505
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,000
your identity is the most suitable for them.

506
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
You must understand that

507
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,000
the information of the internal personnel of this code research institute

508
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
will be found as soon as possible.

509
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Comrade Bai Ye.

510
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
I understand.

511
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Once there is progress,

512
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
I will immediately report to the organization.

513
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Please wait.

514
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Mr. Lin.

515
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Mr. Lin.

516
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Mr. Lin.

517
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
I have arranged people to protect you

518
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
in every corner of the restaurant.

519
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
I also left two guards at the door.

520
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
They are all good hands that I have practiced.

521
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Please rest assured.

522
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
It seems that there are two guards.

523
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
I will be safe in the future.

524
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
How to say?

525
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,000
The rent is not our own place.

526
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
When I clean up my place tomorrow,

527
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
I won't have to bother you.

528
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Mr. Liang.

529
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
What do you mean?

530
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Sit down.

531
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,000
I am really worried about your injury this time.

532
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
So I was thinking

533
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
that before the code research institute is established,

534
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
I will protect the code experts

535
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
who are close to the new government together.

536
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
I found a place in Sanyang.

537
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
I will come to pick you up when I have cleaned up tomorrow.

538
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
No need.

539
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
I have already lived here very used to it.

540
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
And just like what Mr. Liang said,

541
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
everyone is yours.

542
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
I said,

543
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
I am safer there.

544
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,000
The pain in the eyes

545
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:07,000
The one who is pretending to be serious can't say it clearly

546
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Where is the wind going?

547
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Whose window is shaking?

548
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,000
The heart is thinking

549
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:21,000
It's either you or me

550
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,000
He is watching

551
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:28,000
In the vast night

552
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,000
The tears are floating

553
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,000
A group of injured

554
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,000
He is looking

555
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Wandering in the shadow

556
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,000
The night falls

557
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Looking back at the world

558
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
The wind is blowing

559
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:08,000
The house is a mystery

560
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:12,000
There is no direction and no way out

561
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,000
The pain in the eyes

562
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:19,000
The one who is pretending to be serious can't say it clearly

563
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Where is the wind going?

564
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:26,000
Whose window is shaking?

565
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,000
The heart is thinking

566
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:33,000
It's either you or me

567
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,000
He is watching

568
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,000
In the vast night
