00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:54,880
京�

2
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,080
I'm going back to the Department of Forensic Medicine.

3
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,080
If you can't take me there,

4
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,080
you can quit.

5
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,080
I won't stop you.

6
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,080
Mr. Li.

7
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,080
What can I do for you?

8
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:05,880
Oh,

9
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,080
Chief Yan.

10
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,080
Charlie went to get the medicine for me.

11
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,080
So,

12
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,080
I can only give you

13
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,080
these tickets.

14
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,080
Oh,

15
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,080
it's such a small thing.

16
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,080
Just call me

17
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,080
and I'll go get it.

18
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,080
I don't want you to go there yourself.

19
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,080
Chief Li,

20
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,080
please leave it to me.

21
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,080
Oh,

22
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,080
thank you.

23
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,880
I'm going to Renji Hospital now.

24
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,880
We're going to have a physical examination tomorrow.

25
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,880
Liang informed me so quickly.

26
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:32,880
I'll go in now.

27
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:33,880
Take care.

28
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,880
Since you can't sit,

29
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,880
why do you force yourself?

30
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,880
With Chief Yi's salary,

31
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,880
it's not a big deal

32
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,880
to have a child.

33
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,880
Labor

34
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,880
shouldn't be just for the salary.

35
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:05,880
People are animals of labor.

36
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,880
The one who separates people from animals

37
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:11,880
should be labor.

38
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:15,880
According to what you said,

39
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:16,880
the ladies and ladies

40
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:17,880
who stay at home every day

41
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,880
are not human.

42
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,880
The wives who give birth at home

43
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,880
are the husband's private property.

44
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,880
And the women who get married for living

45
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:28,880
are like selling their marriage.

46
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,880
That's not the life I want.

47
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,880
Miss Yi,

48
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,880
I really admire independent women.

49
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:38,880
But people

50
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,880
have to deal with their own body.

51
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,880
You just vomited so hard.

52
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,880
Are you not feeling well?

53
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:52,880
I'm fine.

54
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,880
I'm fine.

55
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:20,880
Charlie is back.

56
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,880
Goodbye.

57
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:54,880
Open the door.

58
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,880
Wait a minute.

59
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:56,880
Open the door.

60
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:02,880
Thank you.

61
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,880
Thank you.

62
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:04,880
Chief Shen.

63
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,880
Charlie.

64
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,880
It's already afternoon.

65
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,880
I've slept too much.

66
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:09,880
I've slept too much.

67
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,880
Don't tell Chief Liang.

68
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,880
Charlie.

69
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,880
Mr. Li,

70
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:29,880
why are you here?

71
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,880
I'm here to get the tickets.

72
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,880
I'll handle this kind of thing.

73
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,880
I don't need to do it myself.

74
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,880
Thank you, Miss Yi.

75
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,880
You're welcome.

76
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,880
Thank you.

77
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,880
Please,

78
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,880
come down here.

79
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,880
Thank you.

80
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,320
You can leave it to me.

81
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,720
I don't need to do it myself.

82
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,120
Thank you, Miss Yin.

83
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,120
You're welcome.

84
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,120
Thank you, Miss Yin.

85
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,080
You're so annoying.

86
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,080
You're like a ghost.

87
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,080
You're so boring.

88
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,080
You're still walking.

89
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,080
You're so scary.

90
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,080
I'm telling you, Ding Yi.

91
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,080
No matter what,

92
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,880
I won't let you do it alone.

93
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:34,880
Do you understand?

94
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,080
You don't even have the ability to do it alone.

95
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,280
You're not mature enough.

96
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,280
What action?

97
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,280
What action?

98
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,280
You're not mature enough.

99
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,280
What action?

100
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,680
Look at you.

101
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,680
You're sensitive again.

102
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,680
Right?

103
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:56,680
Parole

104
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,980
Miss Xian wants me to finish my mission.

105
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,980
If you ask me to help you,

106
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:21,980
how can Ihelpt her?

107
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,180
Hmm.

108
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:28,980
Director Shen.

109
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,080
Hey, Charlie.

110
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,080
I read your masterpiece before.

111
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,280
It's a great deal.

112
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,480
So I have a favor to ask.

113
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,880
Can you sign my name?

114
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,880
Oh, no.

115
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,280
But you're lucky.

116
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:52,280
Mr. Li is the real boss.

117
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,480
Ha ha ha.

118
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,780
I'm just a

119
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,280
naughty boy.

120
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,080
Your pen is beautiful.

121
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,080
Where did you buy it?

122
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,080
Sir.

123
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:12,680
Sir.

124
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,280
I've been looking for you.

125
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,680
I've been waiting for you.

126
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,280
Charlie.

127
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,080
I'm sorry.

128
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:17,680
Well,

129
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:18,480
I'll sign it later.

130
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:19,680
I'll sign it later.

131
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,680
I'll sign it later.

132
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,080
Knock, knock, knock.

133
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,280
How's it going?

134
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:28,680
The investigation results of the E.S.S.

135
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,280
have been released.

136
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:31,880
You're right.

137
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,480
The Japanese helped Liang Jingyuan to get the position.

138
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,680
As a trade,

139
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,080
Liang Jingyuan will lead

140
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:37,480
the E.S.S.

141
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,280
to the secret code experts.

142
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,280
Among these experts,

143
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,680
many have received

144
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,880
training from American experts.

145
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,480
They will know some secrets

146
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,880
from the US military

147
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,880
to help the Russian army

148
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,280
to build a secret code system.

149
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,480
The E.S.S. is also suspicious

150
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,080
and the data taken by the E.S.S.

151
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,280
may include

152
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,880
the design of the secret code

153
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,880
of the E.S.S.

154
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,480
If this is true,

155
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,680
their time of analysis will be greatly reduced.

156
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,680
The secret code of the E.S.S. has been

157
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,080
in the air since its inception.

158
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,080
It's the most solid problem

159
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,080
in our secret code town.

160
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,680
So it can't be analyzed by the Japanese.

161
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,680
The most important thing is to know

162
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,480
their analysis progress.

163
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,280
It's best to be able to control it.

164
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,680
But Liang Jingyuan doesn't believe in the E.S.S.

165
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,680
He will not go in.

166
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,680
He will not go in.

167
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,680
I can only wait

168
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:27,680
until Liang Jingyuan

169
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,680
is able to

170
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,680
check the secret code of the E.S.S.

171
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,680
tomorrow.

172
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,680
Thank you, Dad.

173
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,680
Help me investigate someone.

174
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,680
You tell me.

175
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:43,680
Forget it.

176
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,680
Is the food not good?

177
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,680
Too much vinegar?

178
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,680
Is it sour?

179
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,680
Just right.

180
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,680
Just right.

181
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,680
I don't know.

182
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,680
I just don't know.

183
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,680
I just don't know.

184
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,680
I just don't know.

185
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,680
You don't know?

186
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,680
I don't know.

187
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,680
I just don't know.

188
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,680
I don't know.

189
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,680
Just right.

190
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,680
I'm done.

191
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,680
Miss Xian.

192
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,680
There is indeed a problem with the E.S.S.

193
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,680
It's just that

194
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,680
I heard it vomit in the lab.

195
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,680
And it actually

196
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,680
knows how to decode.

197
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,680
How do you know it can decode?

198
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,680
I overheard it.

199
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:57,680
In the office,

200
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,680
Ye Yin

201
00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:59,680
scolded Yaya.

202
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,680
Then he said

203
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,680
that he was best at

204
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,680
decoding.

205
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:05,680
So he wanted to go back to

206
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,680
working in the E.S.S.

207
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,680
So I think

208
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,680
Ye Yida is very likely

209
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,680
the person we are looking for.

210
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,680
Think about it.

211
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,680
He has been to the trade union.

212
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,680
And he has been to the military.

213
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,680
And he has been to the military.

214
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,680
He even decoded the code.

215
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,680
You didn't talk to him

216
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,680
about anything, did you?

217
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:23,680
No, I didn't.

218
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,680
I'm not stupid.

219
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,680
I'm not stupid.

220
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,680
I'm not stupid.

221
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,680
I'm not stupid.

222
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,680
I'm not stupid.

223
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,680
I'm not stupid.

224
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,680
I'm not stupid.

225
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,680
By the way,

226
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,680
there is one more important thing.

227
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,680
Yang Jingyuan's missing

228
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,680
is going to organize

229
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,680
everyone to go to the Renji Hospital

230
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,680
for a check-up tomorrow.

231
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,680
So I think

232
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,680
he has also

233
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,680
got some information.

234
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:55,680
He is just going to investigate

235
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,680
the person who is in danger.

236
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,680
I'm going out.

237
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:01,680
Okay.

238
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,680
Miss Jian.

239
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,680
I...

240
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:19,680
I...

241
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,680
I...

242
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,680
I want to have some tea.

243
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:23,680
You go upstairs first.

244
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,680
I have something to talk to Miss Jian.

245
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,680
Okay, go upstairs.

246
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,680
Okay.

247
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,680
Go.

248
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,680
Get in.

249
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,680
Get in.

250
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,680
Miss Jian.

251
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,680
I need the key to Yi Xiuyuan

252
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,680
and Shen Wanqing's office.

253
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,680
What does this have to do with me?

254
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,680
Ye Yin is the head of the headquarters.

255
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,680
I know he has the key to the lock.

256
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:35,680
What do you want to do?

257
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,680
Miss Jian.

258
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,680
You told Ding Yi to keep an eye on Yi Aida.

259
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,680
I didn't ask what you wanted to do.

260
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:51,680
When do you want it?

261
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:53,680
The later the better.

262
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,680
I must get the key

263
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,680
before the check-up tomorrow.

264
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:57,680
Only once.

265
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:59,680
No one will find out.

266
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,680
You are in a hurry.

267
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,680
Now, Liang Jingyuan has already

268
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:03,680
targeted me.

269
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,680
Any unnecessary action

270
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,680
will cause suspicion.

271
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,680
Miss Jian, don't worry.

272
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,680
I won't leave any clues.

273
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,680
No one will suspect you.

274
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,680
I'm sorry,

275
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:19,680
Young Master Gu.

276
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,680
You should think of another way.

277
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,680
Lin Changying.

278
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:29,680
You know Miss Jian, right?

279
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,680
Chongqing has already known

280
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,680
the news of your engagement with Ding Yi.

281
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,680
I've been investigating

282
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:37,680
the news of your engagement.

283
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,680
But I didn't say anything.

284
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,680
But if Miss Jian doesn't want to cooperate,

285
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,680
I'll reconsider.

286
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,680
You are threatening me.

287
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,680
Miss Jian.

288
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:00,680
I'm begging you.

289
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:03,680
The Purple Star Palace is fighting the war.

290
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,680
I'll explain to you when it's done.

291
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,680
If the leader gives you the key tonight,

292
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,680
I'll leave the rest to you.

293
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,680
As for Lin Changying...

294
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,680
Miss Jian, don't worry.

295
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,680
I'll tell my men

296
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:27,680
that Lin Changying

297
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:29,680
is not a bad person.

298
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:35,680
It's better this way.

299
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,680
Yi Yuan.

300
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,680
Bi Yun.

301
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,680
Have you seen the stock?

302
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,680
South, west, east, west, right, left.

303
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,680
How much is it?

304
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,680
One times.

305
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,680
I can smile even in my dreams.

306
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,680
How can I make money better?

307
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,680
Any good news?

308
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,680
Ask around and tell me.

309
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,680
I'm asking around.

310
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,680
If there's any good news,

311
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,680
I'll tell you right away.

312
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,680
I'll rely on you.

313
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,680
You are my talent.

314
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,680
Look at this.

315
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,680
Does it look like Miss Yi?

316
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,680
Don't mention this to me.

317
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,680
You can't do anything.

318
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,680
You're not in good health.

319
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,680
You don't know what you learned

320
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,680
in the Soviet Union.

321
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,680
You're always talking about

322
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,680
the water and the soup.

323
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,680
You're so stingy.

324
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,680
Mrs. Yang.

325
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,680
It's time.

326
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,680
Wash the medicine.

327
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,680
Okay.

328
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,680
I brought a French imported soy sauce.

329
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,680
The sheep's head beer is ready.

330
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,680
Try it.

331
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,680
Your is the best.

332
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,680
Mrs. Yang, please sit.

333
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,680
Miss Qian,

334
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,680
I listened to your advice

335
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,680
and bought the sheep's head beer.

336
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,680
It's a big profit.

337
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,680
What's the relationship between us?

338
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,680
How can I let you suffer?

339
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,680
I like to hear that.

340
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,680
From now on,

341
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,680
you and your friends come.

342
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,680
I only charge you the cost.

343
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,680
Then I'll accept your kindness.

344
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,680
I...

345
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,680
I'm sorry.

346
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,680
I'm sorry.

347
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,680
I'm sorry.

348
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,680
I bought a new record.

349
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,680
It's very nice.

350
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,680
I'll play it for you.

351
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,680
Mrs. Yang, how is it?

352
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,680
It's great.

353
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,680
It's very good.

354
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,680
The two people who will organize

355
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,680
the research team tomorrow

356
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,680
and all the family members

357
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,680
will go to the Renji Hospital

358
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,680
for a blood test.

359
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,680
I suspect that he has already got the news

360
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:49,980
that Bai Ye has a

361
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:51,980
This letter

362
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:52,980
can make comrade Bai Ye

363
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:53,980
believe in you.

364
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:55,980
He is on his way.

365
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:57,980
We have to find Bai Ye

366
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:59,980
before Liang Jingyuan.

367
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:02,980
I understand.

368
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:13,980
Okay.

369
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:14,980
I'll give this head oil

370
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:16,980
to Mrs. Liang.

371
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:17,980
Use more.

372
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:21,980
Mrs. Liang.

373
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:23,980
Oh, it's good.

374
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:34,980
Mrs. Liang,

375
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:35,980
are you comfortable?

376
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:37,980
I'm brave.

377
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:40,980
I'm so tired.

378
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:41,980
I'm so tired.

379
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:42,980
I'm so tired.

380
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:43,980
I'm so tired.

381
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:44,980
I'm so tired.

382
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:45,980
I'm so tired.

383
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:46,980
I'm so tired.

384
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:49,980
I'm so tired.

385
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:50,980
I'm so tired.

386
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:07,980
It's already 10 o'clock.

387
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:09,980
Why hasn't he come back yet?

388
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:17,980
What were you two doing here?

389
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:20,980
Don't meddle in my business.

390
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:27,980
Who is it?

391
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:29,980
Charlie, it's me.

392
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:38,980
I'm sorry.

393
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:39,980
I'm sorry.

394
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:40,980
I'm sorry.

395
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:41,980
I'm sorry.

396
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:42,980
I'm sorry.

397
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:43,980
I'm sorry.

398
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:44,980
I'm sorry.

399
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:46,980
Mrs. Liang is back.

400
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:47,980
Please come in.

401
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:08,980
Thank you, Miss Xie.

402
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:16,980
Thank you.

403
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:46,980
What else do you want?

404
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:52,980
You two were here just now.

405
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:56,980
What are you talking about?

406
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:01,980
Don't meddle in my business.

407
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:16,980
Okay.

408
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,980
What did you ask Miss Xianxing to do for you?

409
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:39,980
Is it related to your secret code?

410
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:45,980
I'm asking you.

411
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:51,980
What are you two talking about?

412
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:53,980
You're so cute.

413
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:56,980
Then you tell me what you're doing for Miss Xianxing.

414
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:58,980
I'll tell you what I'm doing.

415
00:23:58,980 --> 00:23:59,980
How about it?

416
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:03,980
I won't ask.

417
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:05,980
I didn't enter.

418
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:15,980
Actually,

419
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:18,980
if you and Miss Xianxing

420
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:21,980
could have been so in-depth...

421
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:22,980
No.

422
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:24,980
If you and Miss Xianxing

423
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:28,980
could have been so

424
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:29,980
harmonious,

425
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:31,980
it doesn't matter

426
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:33,980
if I don't know anything.

427
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:45,980
Sometimes I think

428
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:50,980
if we were a real family,

429
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:54,980
it would be great.

430
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:57,980
When the war is over,

431
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:01,980
let's find a place with mountains and rivers.

432
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:05,980
You take Miss Meng here.

433
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:07,980
We'll be neighbors.

434
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:09,980
If you have no oil,

435
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:11,980
you can borrow it from me.

436
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:13,980
If I have no face,

437
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:15,980
I'll go to your house.

438
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:20,980
When we have children,

439
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:23,980
we'll give them a child.

440
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:25,980
If they're all girls,

441
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:27,980
we're not afraid.

442
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:29,980
We'll let them be.

443
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:40,980
Lin Yi.

444
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:42,980
Do you know why

445
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:43,980
I don't tell you everything?

446
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:48,980
Because sometimes

447
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:50,980
you're too simple.

448
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:53,980
I'm working with Miss Xian

449
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:56,980
to do everything.

450
00:25:57,980 --> 00:25:58,980
Because you're in the middle.

451
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:03,980
But we don't know

452
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:07,980
what we'll do next.

453
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:14,980
Su...

454
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:29,980
I can't sleep at noon.

455
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:43,980
Su...

456
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:14,980
Phone ringing

457
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:27,980
This is Charlie speaking.

458
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:31,980
Okay.

459
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:33,980
Thank you, Secretary Jiang.

460
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:35,980
I'll tell Mr. Li.

461
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:38,980
Goodbye.

462
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:44,980
The inspection is cancelled.

463
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:50,980
The inspection is changed.

464
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:57,980
The inspection is changed to Lu Jing Hospital.

465
00:27:58,980 --> 00:27:59,980
Come on.

466
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:00,980
Give it to me.

467
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:03,980
Where are you going?

468
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:06,980
I'll get you the certificate.

469
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:07,980
Don't tell anyone.

470
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:14,980
What's wrong?

471
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:41,980
What are you doing?

472
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:43,980
Get in the car.

473
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:57,980
Director Li.

474
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:58,980
Mrs. Li.

475
00:28:58,980 --> 00:28:59,980
Go to the inspection.

476
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:01,980
Is there anything wrong with Director Shen?

477
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:03,980
Where's Charlie?

478
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:05,980
Charlie went to help me get my things.

479
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:07,980
Director Shen is looking for him.

480
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:08,980
That's it.

481
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:10,980
You know,

482
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:12,980
we were not in the institute the day before.

483
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:13,980
But the Communist Party

484
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:15,980
chose this day to go out.

485
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:17,980
We were all passive.

486
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:19,980
I was caught in a hurry.

487
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:21,980
My car was still there.

488
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:23,980
I wanted to get my car back today.

489
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:25,980
But I arranged an inspection.

490
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:27,980
Look, I don't have a car.

491
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:28,980
How can I go to the inspection?

492
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:31,980
I don't understand what you mean.

493
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:34,980
You want to take my car

494
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:36,980
to the hospital for inspection?

495
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:38,980
But I'm sorry.

496
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:39,980
I...

497
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:41,980
You're smart.

498
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:42,980
You're a genius.

499
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:44,980
I have two apprentices.

500
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:46,980
Li Huan and Ning Yu.

501
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:50,980
Why didn't you

502
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:52,980
ask your two apprentices

503
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:54,980
to get your car back?

504
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:57,980
They're my apprentices.

505
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:59,980
I can't let my apprentices know

506
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:00,980
what I do.

507
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:05,980
I promised Director Liang

508
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:07,980
I would never go there again.

509
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:08,980
It's not good

510
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:10,980
if I go there in two days.

511
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:13,980
It would be great

512
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:15,980
if Li can get my car back

513
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:16,980
by the way.

514
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:18,980
My car is parked

515
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:19,980
at 37 Lv Ban Road,

516
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:22,980
in the hands of Miss Su.

517
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:28,980
I'm sorry, Director Shen.

518
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:29,980
You saw it.

519
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:30,980
My wife is driving today.

520
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:31,980
I can't let my wife

521
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:33,980
do the job for others.

522
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:35,980
Well, Director Li.

523
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:36,980
Director Li.

524
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:37,980
I'm sorry, Director Shen.

525
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:48,980
You're angry

526
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:49,980
for not letting me get my car back?

527
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:50,980
Go.

528
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:05,980
I didn't expect

529
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:06,980
there would be a fight between two apprentices.

530
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:08,980
It's too late

531
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:09,980
to stop this now.

532
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:14,980
When you get to the hospital,

533
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:16,980
I'll keep an eye on Ye Da.

534
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:17,980
Keep an eye on Dong Jingbo,

535
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:18,980
Liu Fangban

536
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:19,980
and Shen Wenjing.

537
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:21,980
Okay.

538
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:51,860
The

539
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:01,980
Mrs. Li.

540
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:02,980
You're all here.

541
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:03,980
Mrs. Li.

542
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:05,980
Mrs. Li,

543
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:06,980
sit here.

544
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:08,980
It's okay.

545
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:09,980
There's a seat inside.

546
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:14,980
Mrs. Li,

547
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:16,980
Miss Yi.

548
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:19,980
Miss Xian.

549
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:20,980
Come and sit.

550
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:23,980
Are you feeling better?

551
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:26,980
I feel better

552
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:27,980
after taking the medicine you gave me.

553
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:29,980
It's good to have the effect.

554
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:31,980
Only women

555
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:32,980
can understand the pain of women.

556
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:34,980
I'll give you the prescription next time.

557
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:36,980
When you come to the appointment,

558
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:37,980
prepare yourself in advance.

559
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:40,980
Miss Xian,

560
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:41,980
you're so kind.

561
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:43,980
Now I know

562
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:44,980
why Director Li

563
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:45,980
cares about you so much.

564
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:47,980
Really?

565
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:49,980
Yes.

566
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:53,980
I once read a book

567
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:55,980
about women's liberation.

568
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:57,980
It said

569
00:33:58,980 --> 00:33:59,980
the only reason men and women

570
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:01,980
should be together

571
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:03,980
is mutual love.

572
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:04,980
This is the real secret.

573
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:06,980
I think I saw

574
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:07,980
marriage

575
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:10,980
in you and Director Li.

576
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:13,980
What's the name of the book?

577
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:15,980
I want to read it too.

578
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:19,980
I'm sorry.

579
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:21,980
I can't remember it.

580
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:26,980
Next.

581
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:28,980
I'll go in first.

582
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:42,980
Qiqi.

583
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:45,980
Wuqi.

584
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:47,980
Wuqi.

585
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:50,980
Xiqi.

586
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:53,980
Wuqi.

587
00:34:58,980 --> 00:34:59,980
Check your lungs first.

588
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:03,980
Do you feel uncomfortable

589
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:04,980
after playing here?

590
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:07,980
Relax.

591
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:08,980
Miss Yi,

592
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:09,980
your stomach

593
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:10,980
may be a little problem.

594
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:12,980
I suggest you do

595
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:13,980
further check-ups.

596
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:22,980
Director Su.

597
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:23,980
Director Su.

598
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:25,980
Director Su.

599
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:26,980
Director Su.

600
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:27,980
Director Su.

601
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:28,980
Director Su.

602
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:29,980
Director Su.

603
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:30,980
Director Su.

604
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:31,980
Director Su.

605
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:32,980
How is it?

606
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:33,980
It's fine.

607
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:34,980
It's just a little bit of a small problem.

608
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:35,980
I'm sorry.

609
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:36,980
I'm sorry.

610
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:37,980
It's just a little bit of a small problem.

611
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:38,980
It's too common in our industry.

612
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:40,980
Who says it's not?

613
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:42,980
I can't afford to eat when I'm busy.

614
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:43,980
I can't even

615
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:44,980
bear the stomachache of the iron.

616
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:46,980
This is not normal.

617
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:47,980
I just came out of the hospital for a check-up.

618
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:48,980
Check it out.

619
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:49,980
I'll tell you the truth.

620
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:51,980
I thought I was in the Japanese hospital.

621
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:52,980
I can definitely see the Japanese.

622
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:53,980
To communicate with them,

623
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:55,980
I specially learned a few Japanese words.

624
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:56,980
Thank you.

625
00:35:57,980 --> 00:35:58,980
As a result,

626
00:35:58,980 --> 00:35:59,980
this Chinese doctor

627
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:00,980
is a little bit of a Chinese.

628
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:02,980
Honey.

629
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:03,980
Goodbye.

630
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:04,980
Director Lin.

631
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:05,980
You're here.

632
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:08,980
There's no rest outside.

633
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:09,980
Why don't I take you in first?

634
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:12,980
Thank you.

635
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:13,980
Come on, this way.

636
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:15,980
Doctor.

637
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:18,980
This is our director.

638
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:20,980
He's not very comfortable with his eyes.

639
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:21,980
There's no rest outside.

640
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:23,980
Why don't you let him come in first?

641
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:24,980
Sure.

642
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:25,980
No need.

643
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:26,980
Rules are rules.

644
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:27,980
I'll wait a minute.

645
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:30,980
Then you sit down and rest for a while.

646
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:31,980
Thank you.

647
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:32,980
Take it easy.

648
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:36,980
Director Lin.

649
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:37,980
I'll leave you to it.

650
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:40,980
This way.

651
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:41,980
Push the button.

652
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:42,980
Okay.

653
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:45,980
Miss Li.

654
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:47,980
You should be careful with your diet.

655
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:50,980
Don't eat food that's too spicy.

656
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:51,980
Okay.

657
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:53,980
It's okay.

658
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:54,980
I'll help you.

659
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:55,980
I'm sorry.

660
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:02,980
Thank you.

661
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:17,980
Thank you, doctor.

662
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:18,980
Okay.

663
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:19,980
Take care of your diet.

664
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:20,980
Okay.

665
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:23,980
Next.

666
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:28,980
Miss Li.

667
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:29,980
I'm going to do the next check-up.

668
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:32,980
Doctor.

669
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:33,980
My stomach is fine, right?

670
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:35,980
It's just a slight stomach cramp.

671
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:37,980
But you have to be careful.

672
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:40,980
If you continue to eat non-reversible foods,

673
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:42,980
it's very likely that the disease will get worse

674
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:43,980
and develop a stomach cancer.

675
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:45,980
It's that serious?

676
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:48,980
Can you please help me look at the medicine for the disease?

677
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:49,980
I'm sorry.

678
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:50,980
We're only responsible for the check-up.

679
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:54,980
Thank you.

680
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:56,980
Thank you.

681
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:57,980
Thank you.

682
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:58,980
Thank you.

683
00:37:58,980 --> 00:37:59,980
Thank you.

684
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:00,980
Thank you.

685
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:02,980
Next.

686
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:05,980
Thank you.

687
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:06,980
Director Shen, you're here.

688
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:07,980
Take care.

689
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:11,980
Director Shen.

690
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:14,980
Director Li.

691
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:15,980
I thought it was me.

692
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:18,980
Shen Wenqing, right?

693
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:20,980
It's you.

694
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:26,980
This way.

695
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:32,980
Be careful.

696
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:38,980
Lift your legs.

697
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:43,980
If you feel uncomfortable, tell me.

698
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:44,980
Okay.

699
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:45,980
Take a deep breath.

700
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:47,980
Breathe.

701
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:50,980
Does it hurt?

702
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:51,980
No.

703
00:38:57,980 --> 00:38:58,980
How about here?

704
00:38:58,980 --> 00:38:59,980
No.

705
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:00,980
How about here?

706
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:01,980
It doesn't hurt.

707
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:03,980
How do you feel here?

708
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:05,980
It doesn't hurt.

709
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:06,980
I'm fine.

710
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:09,980
How about here?

711
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:10,980
It doesn't hurt.

712
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:12,980
Does it hurt here?

713
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:20,980
Director Li.

714
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:23,980
It's not easy for people like you to do cryptography.

715
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:24,980
Look.

716
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:25,980
You fell asleep on the battlefield.

717
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:26,980
It's really too hard.

718
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:30,980
It's done.

719
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:34,980
I can't sleep.

720
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:36,980
I'm sorry.

721
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:42,980
I guess there's no problem.

722
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:44,980
It's all good.

723
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:45,980
Let's go to the next one.

724
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:46,980
Okay.

725
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:48,980
Thank you.

726
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:51,980
Director Li, I'm going out first.

727
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:56,980
Master.

728
00:39:57,980 --> 00:39:58,980
Director Shen, are you okay?

729
00:39:58,980 --> 00:39:59,980
I'm fine.

730
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:00,980
That's good.

731
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:01,980
Take your time.

732
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:02,980
Thank you, Director Shen.

733
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:08,980
Director Shen.

734
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:09,980
Charlie.

735
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:10,980
That's possible.

736
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:13,980
It should be everyone.

737
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:28,980
Well.

738
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:33,980
Correct answers are the most possible choices.

739
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:38,140
That's not true

740
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:40,140
Dong Jinbo and Liu Fangbai?

741
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:41,140
Is that possible?

742
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:47,140
Comrade Baiye has always been very cautious.

743
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:51,140
When he was in the Northeast,

744
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:55,140
he always helped Cai Guoyao through his superior, Lao Hei.

745
00:40:57,140 --> 00:41:00,140
So he didn't want anyone to know he had a guard.

746
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:05,140
According to what you just described,

747
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:09,140
these two people didn't want to hide that they had guards.

748
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:14,140
The other officer, Yi Aida,

749
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:17,140
secretly exchanged his own check-up list.

750
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:21,140
He didn't want anyone to know he had guards.

751
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:26,140
Yes.

752
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:28,140
Last time at the exchange,

753
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:30,140
when Baiye found out there was an ambush,

754
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:33,140
he must have felt that he had attracted Liang Jinyuan's attention.

755
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:35,140
And this time Liang Jinyuan,

756
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:37,140
somehow, organized everyone to check-up.

757
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:38,140
Baiye,

758
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:41,140
it's very likely that Liang Jinyuan also got news that he had guards.

759
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:44,140
So he must have hidden his own check-up list.

760
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:46,140
Right?

761
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:53,140
Yes.

762
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:54,140
Yes.

763
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:04,140
Is there a problem with Shen Wanqing's calculation?

764
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:07,140
He has a lot of problems on his calculation.

765
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:10,140
But each one is wrong.

766
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:11,140
Some are wrong in the formula,

767
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:13,140
some are wrong in the treatment.

768
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:16,140
Isn't this a good thing?

769
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:20,140
A set of codes can be used to block the road,

770
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:22,140
but the road is full of traps.

771
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:26,140
The ability to solve the problem is only written in two or three kinds of calculations.

772
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:28,140
And it's also in the trap.

773
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:29,140
But Shen Wanqing,

774
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:33,140
at least 20 types of problems are on his calculation.

775
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:37,140
But each one is wrong when it reaches the end.

776
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:40,140
It's like he already knows the right answer,

777
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:42,140
but he's deliberately going around the corner,

778
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:44,140
deliberately avoiding the right answer.

779
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:48,140
You mean Shen Wanqing has already...

780
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:49,140
That's right.

781
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:52,140
I guess Shen Wanqing has already solved the seven codes.

782
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:53,140
But he didn't report it.

783
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:55,140
Not only that,

784
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:57,140
he also handed in a different wrong answer every day

785
00:42:57,140 --> 00:43:00,140
to cover up the fact that he had solved it.

786
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:04,140
Okay.

787
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:07,140
I'll send these photos back to Chongqing soon.

788
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:09,140
Okay.

789
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:11,140
These are Shen Wanqing's.

790
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:12,140
Okay.
