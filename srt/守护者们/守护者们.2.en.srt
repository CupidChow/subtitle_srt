1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,040
some weights

2
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:44,500
travel

3
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,600
You are so beautiful.

4
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,000
Have a nice day.

5
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You too.

6
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,400
Hi, Miss Ma.

7
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,000
Hello, Miss Xue.

8
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Please sit.

9
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,000
They are all my old friends from the Ministry of Works.

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I'm sorry.

11
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Maybe one day

12
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
we will go to the British Empire

13
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
to take over the British Embassy

14
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
and take over the Red Cross.

15
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I believe that at that time

16
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Miss Xue will also

17
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
treat me like this.

18
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Wu Tian Sang, you must be joking.

19
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I'm not that great.

20
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
When you sit on the floor,

21
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
you feel like you are in a movie.

22
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
You have to be able to

23
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
recite the lines of the lines

24
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
in order to be able to recite them.

25
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
You are busy with your meals.

26
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Isn't that right?

27
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
The Red Cross

28
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
The Red Cross

29
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Only those who have never been injured

30
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
can laugh at the scars of others.

31
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
What is the light

32
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
that shines in the window?

33
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Where is the candle?

34
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Let me go first.

35
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Tai-Jun, let me go first.

36
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I need to go to the hall.

37
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Get up.

38
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
The beautiful sun.

39
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
The hungry moon.

40
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Continue acting.

41
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Don't be so naughty.

42
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Let me go first.

43
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Close the door.

44
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Close the door.

45
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
She is

46
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
more beautiful

47
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
because of her female disciple.

48
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Tai-Jun, it's too late.

49
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Tai-Jun, I'm begging you.

50
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Don't rush to the stage.

51
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Why is it still not bright?

52
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Help!

53
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
She's talking.

54
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Help!

55
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
She's talking.

56
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Help!

57
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
She's talking.

58
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Who is it?

59
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
The name of the rose is still bright.

60
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I didn't come here.

61
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Mr. Mutian, are you done?

62
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I haven't finished the play yet.

63
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I'll do it again.

64
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Why did you come back to the garden?

65
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Come here.

66
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Come here.

67
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Come back.

68
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
The tree is broken.

69
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
The tree is bleeding.

70
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Look down.

71
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
If you're here,

72
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
they won't let you live.

73
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Go to the cave.

74
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Go to the cave.

75
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Qiu Xi,

76
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
you're messing around with Luo Miao again.

77
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
You're messing around with Luo Miao again.

78
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
You'll see.

79
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
You'll see.

80
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Stop talking nonsense.

81
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I can't be happy for others.

82
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Look at this place.

83
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Stop.

84
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Don't move.

85
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Okay.

86
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
The person I'm looking for is here.

87
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
But even though he's not your sidekick,

88
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
if you run away...

89
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Stop running away.

90
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Right here.

91
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Kill him.

92
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Kill him.

93
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Kill him.

94
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Kill him.

95
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
You can die.

96
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Qiu Xi.

97
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Luo Miao.

98
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Will you let go of the hatred

99
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
and run away with me?

100
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I will.

101
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I will.

102
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Qiu Xi.

103
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Zhu Li.

104
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
We're finally together.

105
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
We're finally together.

106
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Let's dance together.

107
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Let's dance.

108
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Chief,

109
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
we've confirmed that the wedding is coming from behind.

110
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
From behind?

111
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
There's no doubt.

112
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Their car is still behind us.

113
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Hey, Kondo.

114
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Yes?

115
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Where's the car?

116
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Where's the car?

117
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Fu, you go first.

118
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Okay.

119
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Fu.

120
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Fu.

121
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Fu.

122
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
What's going on?

123
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Enough, don't ask so many questions.

124
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Don't ask anymore.

125
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Stand further away.

126
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Come out.

127
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Come out.

128
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,760
I'll wait for information from you at the company office of his ex-girlfriend.

129
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,880
Friends.

130
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,080
Congratulations on a successful performance.

131
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,040
Some guy

132
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,760
attacked you with a gun.

133
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,800
Oops.

134
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,080
What are you doing?

135
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,080
Who made such a big trouble for the troupe?

136
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,480
This...

137
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,200
Brother, you can't die.

138
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,520
If you die, what should I do?

139
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,880
If you die, what should I do?

140
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,880
I'll go.

141
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,200
Take care of the body.

142
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,200
Take care of the body?

143
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,200
Go in the second half of the night.

144
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,200
Don't let anyone see you.

145
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,200
What?

146
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,200
Are you scared?

147
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,200
I'll go to someone else.

148
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,200
No, I'm not scared.

149
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,200
I'll go.

150
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,200
Tie them up.

151
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,200
Throw them into the basement.

152
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,200
Okay.

153
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,200
Okay.

154
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,200
After you take care of these messes,

155
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,600
take your time to check them.

156
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,600
Okay.

157
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,600
Wake up.

158
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,600
I want you to be brave.

159
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I want you to never break my code.

160
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Then we'll be even.

161
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I...

162
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I will...

163
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I will teach you...

164
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
to be a good man.

165
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Okay.

166
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Oh, my God!

167
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
What happened?

168
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
You scared me!

169
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,400
Great!

170
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,400
I'm glad you're awake!

171
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Get up!

172
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Tell me where the antidote is.

173
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
My hands and feet are numb.

174
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,400
I've got poison all over my body.

175
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,400
Give me the antidote!

176
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Who exploded it?

177
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Miss Xian asked them to do it.

178
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
We only have one yellow case left.

179
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
We'll use it all.

180
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
We're so kind to you.

181
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Let's make a deal.

182
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Give me the antidote.

183
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
We're running out of time.

184
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Thank her for me.

185
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Stop it!

186
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Give me the antidote!

187
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I lied to you.

188
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
It's not real.

189
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
It's a cuff.

190
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Poison.

191
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I lied to you.

192
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Yanyi!

193
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Yanyi!

194
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Miss,

195
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
what did Miss Xian say?

196
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
You're in trouble.

197
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
What are you doing?

198
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
She's a lady.

199
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
You should help her.

200
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Help her.

201
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Yes.

202
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Miss,

203
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
did you knock me out?

204
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Are you hungry?

205
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Brother,

206
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
would you like to eat?

207
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
No.

208
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
What time is it?

209
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
It's midnight.

210
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Do you have a phone here?

211
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Yes.

212
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
What's wrong?

213
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I'll give you a phone number.

214
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Call me back.

215
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Tell the person who answered the phone

216
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
to go to the customs

217
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
and make a record of the passport.

218
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I'll take the photo.

219
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Name?

220
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Zharigu.

221
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I have a phone.

222
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
It's in Sister Byun's office.

223
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Yes.

224
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I have to ask her for permission.

225
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Yes.

226
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Miss,

227
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I'll tell you.

228
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
If it's too late,

229
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
your brother Ding Yi won't survive.

230
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
He told the Japanese

231
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
that I'm his assistant.

232
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
And he just came back.

233
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
The Japanese will check it out.

234
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
It's too late if it's too late.

235
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Ding Yi is really a genius

236
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
to recruit the secret branch chief of the customs.

237
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I'll tell them about it.

238
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Okay.

239
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I'll go as soon as it's clear.

240
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
As for Ding Yi...

241
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Sister Byun!

242
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
My little ancestor,

243
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I've told you many times.

244
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
You always remember

245
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
the door to the customs.

246
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Yes.

247
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I remember.

248
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I remember.

249
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I can't remember.

250
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I'm sorry, brother.

251
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
You...

252
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Sister Byun,

253
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I want to make a phone call.

254
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
It's so late.

255
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
It's the basement.

256
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Ding Yi called his friend

257
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
and said that

258
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
the Japanese would check it out

259
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
if he had a passport.

260
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Where else do you want to call?

261
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
He didn't say.

262
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
He just said

263
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
it would be too late if it's too late.

264
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Ring...

265
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Ring...

266
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Ring...

267
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Ring...

268
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Ring...

269
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Cheng Ze is called to march.

270
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I'm sorry, it's my fault.

271
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
What are you laughing at?

272
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
My brother has been working all day.

273
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
It's all because of you.

274
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I've finally discovered that

275
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
you're the god who sent me to smash my head.

276
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I'm happy because you're good at acting.

277
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Look at you now.

278
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
You're a good actor.

279
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
You're a good actor.

280
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Look at you now.

281
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
You're a good actor.

282
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
You're a good actor.

283
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I like to hear that.

284
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I'm a professional actor.

285
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Are you so confident about your acting?

286
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Of course.

287
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Let me tell you this.

288
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
In Shanghai, everyone calls me

289
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Goden-Ru Zhuo Bielin.

290
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I have three treasures.

291
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Ten people have good memory.

292
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
You can just tell me one sentence.

293
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I'll go to the north and south.

294
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
You can just ask me to imitate

295
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
the ten things you can do.

296
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Well,

297
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I won't smash your head.

298
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I'll give you a head.

299
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I'll give you a role.

300
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
The main character.

301
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
How do you feel?

302
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Do you have confidence?

303
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
What do you mean?

304
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I mean

305
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
you keep imitating Lv Yue Se

306
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
and keep acting him.

307
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I won't.

308
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
You said Lv Yue Se is a traitor.

309
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I won't.

310
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I won't.

311
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I won't.

312
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Lv Yue Se is a traitor.

313
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I won't be a traitor.

314
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Look,

315
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
you helped Lv Yue Se to teach the Japanese.

316
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
It's true that you have the agreement of traitors.

317
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
But I'm different.

318
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:03,580
I'm from the

319
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:04,580
I won't.

320
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:06,000
I'll pay you a lot of money.

321
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I won't go.

322
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I'll give you another drink on this basis.

323
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
That won't do.

324
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
So,

325
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
if the Japanese knew

326
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
that the real Lv Yue Se is dead,

327
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
and the fake Lv Yue Se is in Chaosheng Group,

328
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
what would the Japanese do?

329
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Gu!

330
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
You can trick me.

331
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
You can't trick our group.

332
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
He's one of our people.

333
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
No one can force him.

334
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
No one can force him.

335
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Miss Xia,

336
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
if the Japanese knew

337
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
that the person they were looking for

338
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
is dead in your area,

339
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
what would they do?

340
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I'll throw you into Huangpu River right now.

341
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
No one knows what happened here.

342
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Miss Xia, you won't.

343
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Why not?

344
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Be kind.

345
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I don't care who you are.

346
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
If you want to bully me on my territory,

347
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
you have to ask me first.

348
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Miss Xia,

349
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I always thought

350
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
that I was a burden to our group.

351
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I didn't expect you to...

352
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
No,

353
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
No, Miss Xia,

354
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
this person is too dangerous.

355
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I have to leave.

356
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I have to leave.

357
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I have to leave.

358
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I will protect you.

359
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Tell us the details

360
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
of your source of the fire.

361
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
And

362
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
also give us the income of the fire.

363
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Then we will decide

364
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
whether to release you or not.

365
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Leave.

366
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Miss Xia,

367
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I'm leaving now.

368
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I'm leaving now.

369
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I'm leaving now.

370
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Now we can talk about

371
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
who that dead man is.

372
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Don't be excited.

373
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I can tell you,

374
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
but before I tell you,

375
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
you have to tell me

376
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
how the body and the car

377
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
were handled.

378
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Captain Kobayashi,

379
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
the person has come out.

380
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
There must be

381
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
some problems with that grave.

382
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Captain,

383
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
what's the matter?

384
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Nothing.

385
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Don't move.

386
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Don't move.

387
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Excuse me.

388
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
What are you doing here?

389
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
What are you doing here?

390
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
We are

391
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
washing clothes.

392
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Captain,

393
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
our costumes...

394
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
costumes...

395
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
They are our costumes.

396
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Miss Xia is really a good person.

397
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
In the world of chaos,

398
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
you have to be able to protect yourself.

399
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
But actually,

400
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I brought this trouble.

401
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I can call my people to handle it.

402
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
But I don't believe you.

403
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Why should Miss Xia

404
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
kill someone thousands of miles away?

405
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
In the world of chaos,

406
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Miss Xia can do

407
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
the job of

408
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
maintaining order

409
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
and holding guns.

410
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I think

411
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
it's a wise thing.

412
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I think we will have

413
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
many opportunities to cooperate in the future.

414
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
If you want to cooperate,

415
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
tell me first

416
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
who I have to deal with

417
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
and who I have to deal with.

418
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
And

419
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
who are you?

420
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Me too.

421
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
My surname is Gu.

422
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Gu Yaoshan.

423
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
I just came back from the hospital.

424
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
The person who died

425
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
is called Li Yuese.

426
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
He is my classmate.

427
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I thought

428
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
if the conditions were enough for you,

429
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I could get you married.

430
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
But it seems impossible.

431
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
But Li Yuese,

432
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
if you want to continue

433
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
being a traitor to the Japanese,

434
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
then

435
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
let's

436
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
let's do it together.

437
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Traitor?

438
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Brother,

439
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
I...

440
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I have to clarify something.

441
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
I don't know anything.

442
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I just went to the Japanese

443
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
to teach Japanese businessmen.

444
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
I just want to make some money.

445
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
I'm not a traitor.

446
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Be careful, it's hot.

447
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
It's hot.

448
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
It's hot.

449
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Brother Dingyi,

450
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
are you

451
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
okay?

452
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
I'm fine.

453
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
What are you talking about?

454
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
I've never seen you

455
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
so happy.

456
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Can you really

457
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
help me in this situation?

458
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
No.

459
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
It's okay, don't worry.

460
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
You can't do this kind of thing anymore.

461
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
It's dangerous tonight.

462
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
When I was

463
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
in a desperate situation,

464
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
I was hungry and scared.

465
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
I thought

466
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
I could make some more money.

467
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
I tried.

468
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Don't worry.

469
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
I'll listen to you.

470
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
I won't do this kind of thing again.

471
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Luckily, Miss Xian is here.

472
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
I wonder

473
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
how she's doing with that thing.

474
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
No problem.

475
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Miss Xian is a great person.

476
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
She won't cause any trouble.

477
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Wait for her.

478
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
You eat.

479
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Try it.

480
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Eat.

481
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
You eat?

482
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
I won't eat.

483
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Don't eat.

484
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
I won't eat.

485
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Your surname is Gu.

486
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
The leader of Changze Shipyard

487
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
came to find a man named Gu.

488
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
So, in this world,

489
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
we have two conclusions.

490
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
One is that Ding Yi did a good job

491
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
of deceiving the Japanese.

492
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Second, Li Yue Se is very important

493
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
to the Japanese.

494
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
What do you want Ding Yi to do for you?

495
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Miss Xian,

496
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
we haven't cooperated yet.

497
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Since you don't want to be honest,

498
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
then you don't want to be a matchmaker.

499
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Mr. Gu, please go back.

500
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
I understand.

501
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
It seems that Miss Xian

502
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
is really not afraid of offending the Japanese.

503
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Everything that happened

504
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
in our Chaosheng Group tonight,

505
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
if you don't say it,

506
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
the Japanese will be punished.

507
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Miss Xian, please excuse us.

508
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
This is the leader of Gu.

509
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Mr. Gu.

510
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Mr. Gu,

511
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
I've prepared everything you asked.

512
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
I'm here to pick you up.

513
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Okay.

514
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Miss Xian.

515
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Miss Xian.

516
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
I will repay Miss Xian's kindness

517
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
in the future.

518
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
But I also ask Miss Xian

519
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
to consider my proposal.

520
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:41,500
goddess

521
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,200
Come on, take your eggs.

522
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,200
Thank you, sir.

523
00:27:58,800 --> 00:27:59,600
Zhao Fu,

524
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:03,200
what did those Japanese people do yesterday?

525
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,400
They were just a bunch of scoundrels.

526
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:08,000
They messed up a bunch of good plays.

527
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,200
They don't respect the Japanese.

528
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:09,800
Yes.

529
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:10,800
Madam, some dumplings.

530
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,200
What are Miss Xian and her brothers doing?

531
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,600
They seem to be playing the high-level game with Long Er.

532
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,400
Do you want to help them?

533
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,600
No, no, no.

534
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,600
I want to invite you.

535
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,800
I knew you wouldn't do it.

536
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,600
Miss Xian hasn't come yet.

537
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,200
Why are you so anxious?

538
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,000
What are you doing?

539
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,400
You're a child.

540
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,200
You can't have children even if you're hungry.

541
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:38,600
Su Feng,

542
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:39,600
take two cakes

543
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,000
and ask them to make dumplings.

544
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:42,600
Go, go, go.

545
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,400
Go over there.

546
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,400
I'll get you eggs.

547
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:47,800
Liu,

548
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,800
don't forget to fix the vase.

549
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,200
Don't get the red fish stuck.

550
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,000
Biyun,

551
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,800
they're waiting for you to eat.

552
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,400
Why should they wait for me?

553
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,000
They...

554
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:57,600
Let's eat.

555
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,400
Okay.

556
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,800
Let's eat.

557
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,600
Hurry up.

558
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,600
Hurry up.

559
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,200
Let's eat.

560
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,000
Who hasn't eaten?

561
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:04,800
Go over there.

562
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,000
Who hasn't eaten?

563
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,200
Come on.

564
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,000
Song,

565
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,000
stop washing.

566
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:14,600
Let's eat.

567
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:15,600
Okay.

568
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,400
Fried dough sticks.

569
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,400
It's hot.

570
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,200
It's hot.

571
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:19,800
Eat.

572
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,600
I'll do it.

573
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,400
Okay.

574
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:34,800
Miss Xian,

575
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
the Japanese...

576
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,400
Eat and drink.

577
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,000
Is this something you should worry about?

578
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:44,800
Let's eat.

579
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:45,800
You're so annoying.

580
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:46,400
Let's eat.

581
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,400
I can't even stop you from eating.

582
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,200
Let's eat.

583
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,400
Let's eat.

584
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,200
Little girl,

585
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,000
come here.

586
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:51,800
Okay.

587
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Do you want to eat eggs?

588
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:54,800
Yes.

589
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:55,800
Here.

590
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,600
Mom, you didn't sleep with me last night.

591
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,400
I'll sleep with you tonight.

592
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,600
I'll tell you a story.

593
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:05,800
Douzi,

594
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:06,400
Okay.

595
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,000
Come here.

596
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:09,200
Here.

597
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,400
Eat an egg.

598
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,000
Thank you.

599
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,200
Miss Xian,

600
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,400
thank you.

601
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,400
From now on, I'll take care of this life.

602
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,400
It's yours.

603
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,400
You can do whatever you want.

604
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:19,800
Little girl,

605
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,200
do you know

606
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,400
how much trouble you've brought Miss Xian?

607
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:26,800
Just because of you,

608
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,400
more than 20 lives of the group

609
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,800
almost died.

610
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,400
Do you really think those Japanese are businessmen?

611
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,800
They are spies of Japanese secret agencies.

612
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,400
That Wu Tian

613
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,600
is the chief of the secret services of the Japanese secret services.

614
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,600
You know that, right?

615
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
What is a secret agency?

616
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:44,800
You...

617
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,600
It's a Japanese secret agency set up in Shanghai.

618
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,800
Do you know what you mean by doing things for them?

619
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,200
I don't.

620
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:52,600
I...

621
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,200
I was deceived.

622
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,600
I thought

623
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
I was just a substitute

624
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,800
to teach them math.

625
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,200
I really don't know anything.

626
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:01,800
Besides, recently

627
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,200
the group doesn't have my role.

628
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,400
I thought I'd be free

629
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,000
to earn some pocket money.

630
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
It seems that our group owes you.

631
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,400
No, no.

632
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Now the Japanese have targeted our group.

633
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,800
It's dangerous for them to stay.

634
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,600
How about this?

635
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,600
Pack your bags

636
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,800
and leave.

637
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:23,800
Miss Xian,

638
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,200
I know I was wrong.

639
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,200
I really know I was wrong.

640
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,800
Don't drive me away.

641
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:30,200
I don't know anyone except you in Shanghai.

642
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,600
I don't even know where I can go

643
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,000
if I leave the group.

644
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
How about this?

645
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
I'll drive you away.

646
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
I'll drive you away.

647
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
How about this?

648
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
I'll go back to my basement.

649
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
I...

650
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
I promise I'll be there every day.

651
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
And I...

652
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
No need.

653
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Long'er.

654
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Yes.

655
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,000
Miss Xian, are you looking for me?

656
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Take him to the train station.

657
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Take him to the White Horse House.

658
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Go to his mother.

659
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Miss Xian, let me go.

660
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Miss Xian, don't worry.

661
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
I'll definitely help you.

662
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
I'll definitely help you.

663
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Let me go.

664
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Let me go.

665
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Let's go.

666
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Let me go.

667
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Let me go.

668
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Let me go.

669
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Little bastard.

670
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Poor thing.

671
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
He really can't stand this group.

672
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Biyun.

673
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
This...

674
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
This money

675
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
is for Long'er to give Ding Ying's mother.

676
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
If she doesn't leave, it'll be more troublesome.

677
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Besides,

678
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
did you reply to the letter?

679
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Who is the God of the Five Seasons?

680
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,000
The God of the Five Seasons

681
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Young Master.

682
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
The special forces of Chongqing have arrived.

683
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Li Yuese is dead.

684
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
I'm afraid he won't tell anyone.

685
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Li Yuese's password can't be broken.

686
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,000
How can I explain to the soldiers on the battlefield in the north of the Su?

687
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Uncle Gu.

688
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Yes?

689
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
The main hall is back.

690
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Room 424.

691
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
I'll clean it up.

692
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Be careful.

693
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Room 424

694
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Stop.

695
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
You're here.

696
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
What's the battlefield?

697
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
You're the representative of the battlefield.

698
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Let me introduce you.

699
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,000
This is the special forces of Chongqing.

700
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Look.

701
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
There are shells and syringes.

702
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
You should choose here.

703
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
You're too much.

704
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Use this.

705
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
It's refreshing.

706
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
The environment here is bad.

707
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
The passageway is blocked.

708
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Who sent the intelligence here?

709
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
It's me.

710
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
It's good to choose here.

711
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
If the dust reaches a certain concentration,

712
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
it will...

713
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
You just need to check it with a fire.

714
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
This is the last one.

715
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
You can use it before the battle.

716
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:28,000
And then you can destroy all the information here.

717
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Yes.

718
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Director Dai, let me ask you.

719
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:43,000
How many intelligence have you got from the Rejiguan's machine?

720
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Director Luo, you may not know.

721
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,000
This code is Li Yuese's signature to the Japanese.

722
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,280
So using traditional frequency analysis and secret drug co-operation

723
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,920
is of no use at all.

724
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:58,320
Even if you invite all the cryptologists in the world today,

725
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,760
it's impossible to solve it in a short time.

726
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:04,440
Not to mention the cryptologists in Chongqing.

727
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:09,120
So you don't choose to withdraw the debt,

728
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,400
but to fight against fate, right?

729
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:16,240
No, Mr. Lu, you're exaggerating.

730
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,880
How can we fight against fate?

731
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:20,320
We have an idea.

732
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:21,080
Yashin,

733
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
tell Mr. Lu about our persuasion of the Li Yuese case.

734
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:30,120
Li Yuese is the secret agent of Japan.

735
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,360
Li Yuese is not in the cooperative.

736
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,320
He died during the transfer.

737
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,320
Li Yuese is dead.

738
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,280
Dead?

739
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,240
Dead.

740
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:00,520
Yashin, Yashin, I've told you many times.

741
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:02,120
You can't be a hero alone.

742
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,360
You can't be a hero alone.

743
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,200
Look at Mr. Lu...

744
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,760
Am I supposed to be a hero?

745
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:07,840
I've reported to you in advance.

746
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:08,920
Have you sent someone?

747
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,560
If I had more help,

748
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,920
Li Yuese wouldn't have been in the cooperative...

749
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,320
situations.

750
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:21,440
Director Jiang taught us to love the city more than before.

751
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:24,880
Have you loved the city deep and SII have combo'd lawyers?

752
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:42,200
Mr. Lu, you just got here from Shanghai.

753
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:44,200
you didn't understand enough

754
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:47,200
what you said.

755
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:54,200
Although we can't

756
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:56,200
decipher the password of the enemy,

757
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,200
I can

758
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:02,200
change their password.

759
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,200
Let the Japanese

760
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,200
change the most advanced

761
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:10,200
password system in the world.

762
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,200
You're crazy.

763
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,200
I can't do it in a short time.

764
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:20,200
But there is one person

765
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:22,200
who can do it.

766
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,200
Miss Shen!

767
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:26,200
I know I'm wrong!

768
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,200
Don't leave me!

769
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:34,200
Let go!

770
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,200
Stop yelling!

771
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:38,200
If you keep dragging,

772
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,200
I won't be able to talk!

773
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,200
Stop!

774
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:46,200
How dare you kick me!

775
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,200
You're my mother!

776
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:54,200
You can't afford to lose your voice!

777
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,200
You're a grown man!

778
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,200
You're afraid of my toys!

779
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:00,200
You're a monster!

780
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:02,200
Impossible.

781
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:04,200
Why?

782
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,200
Using Wu Tian's trust in Li Yue Se,

783
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,200
Ding Yi convinced Wu Tian

784
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:10,200
to change the password.

785
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,200
He let him change the password.

786
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:14,200
This is the fastest way I can think of.

787
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,200
But he's not Li Yue Se.

788
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:18,200
Li Yue Se is dead.

789
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:20,200
Anyone who knows Li Yue Se

790
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:22,200
can easily decipher this.

791
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:24,200
Mr. Zhou,

792
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:26,200
you don't know Li Yue Se.

793
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:28,200
Li Yue Se was born in England

794
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:30,200
and grew up in England.

795
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,200
He was buried in a book house.

796
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:34,200
So the Chinese he knew before he came back

797
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:36,200
was only me.

798
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:38,200
Li Yue Se has been back for a long time.

799
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:40,200
Has he ever shown himself in public?

800
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:44,200
He has.

801
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:46,200
He knew that he would lose his life

802
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:48,200
if he worked for the Japanese.

803
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:50,200
So he never showed himself in public

804
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,200
in the months he came back.

805
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:54,200
He didn't even agree to clean the hotel.

806
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:56,200
So many people think

807
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:58,200
that Ding Yi is the real Li Yue Se.

808
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,200
Stop!

809
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:02,200
Stop!

810
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,200
I'm sorry.

811
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:06,200
Mr. Zhou, can I say something?

812
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,200
I think

813
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,200
that this plan

814
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:14,200
is not impossible.

815
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:20,200
The key is

816
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,200
that Ding Yi is not our man.

817
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,200
If the plan fails,

818
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:26,200
he's just a dead man.

819
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:28,200
He's not a real man.

820
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,200
He's not a real man.

821
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:32,200
If the plan

822
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,200
succeeds,

823
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,200
it will be

824
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,200
a good opportunity

825
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:40,200
for us to change the situation.

826
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:44,200
It's a good opportunity

827
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:46,200
for us to get rid of the white wolf.

828
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:48,200
It's a good deal.

829
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,200
I wonder

830
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:04,200
what Lawyerespering's plan will be?

831
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,200
What's the plan of our company?

832
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:08,200
What's going to happen?

833
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:10,200
The noodles are coming,

834
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,200
and you tell me about theoodles?

835
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:14,200
We have problems.

836
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:16,200
So I gonna help

837
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,200
someрана entscheiden involved

838
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:20,200
and make coconuts.

839
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:22,200
Thanks, fuss V Jing Why?

840
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:24,200
Different company is definitely different

841
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:26,200
and have different sal strong before

842
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:28,200
begging 10,000원 for 40,000 Basically,

843
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,200
Why is that?

844
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:32,200
Is there any power behind him?

845
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:37,200
I've checked all the actors in his films.

846
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:40,200
Different backgrounds, different rules.

847
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:45,200
But the crew is more clean and clean.

848
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:52,200
Can we go in and search?

849
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:56,200
Master, this is a public place.

850
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:58,200
This is a public place.

851
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:02,200
The security guards and the public security guards are familiar with each other.

852
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,200
There are many foreigners in every show.

853
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:09,200
This is the reason why the women dare not to go far.

854
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:13,200
Perfect!

855
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,200
Okay.

856
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:20,200
If it's not hard, we'll go soft.

857
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,200
She's a woman.

858
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:24,200
More than ten people are waiting for dinner.

859
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,200
There are difficulties without a target.

860
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:31,200
Captain Wang, please bless our show.

861
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:33,200
God bless you.

862
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,200
Miss Jian.

863
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:43,200
Miss Jian, you're back.

864
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:45,200
This is our home-made poster.

865
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,200
Let's go.

866
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:54,200
I have a way to find someone.

867
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:54,200
Home is a mystery

868
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:58,200
No direction, no way out

869
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,200
Pain in the eyes

870
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:05,200
The person who made the fake play is not clear

871
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:08,200
Where is the wind going?

872
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:12,200
Whose window is shaking?

873
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:16,200
The heart is thinking

874
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:19,200
Or you or me

875
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:20,200
The heart is thinking

876
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,200
Or is it going to shout?

877
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:25,200
I don't know

878
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:29,200
Can anyone see it

879
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:33,200
I do not know

880
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:37,200
I see

881
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:44,200
I don't know

882
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:46,200
Who is it?
