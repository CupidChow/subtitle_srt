1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I'm going to be a little bit of a pain in the ass.

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Oh.

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Ah.

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Oh.

30
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I know if I don't come, you can handle it alone.

31
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
What did you smell that dog?

32
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Charlie's, the smell is so slow.

33
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
It's very good.

34
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Then I'll take it every day.

35
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Miss Xing, are you looking for someone?

36
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I want to help you.

37
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Dingyi, thank you for today.

38
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
But I'm sorry, I can't tell you anything else now.

39
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Miss Xing, what are you doing?

40
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Miss Xing, I know you have a reason not to tell me.

41
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
But I also want to tell you that I'm really ready to join you.

42
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
As long as you give me a chance, I will not let you down.

43
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Where are you going?

44
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Where are you going?

45
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Where are you going?

46
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
In Sanli.

47
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
You are here to buy shares with me today.

48
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Of course.

49
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Don't tell Gu Yousheng anything else.

50
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Yi Xiuyuan is now leading people to break the secret code of Xihe.

51
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
What's the situation?

52
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
As far as I know, Yi Xiuyuan was one of the top traders in Chongqing.

53
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
But since American experts established the black market, he was rejected.

54
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
So he was angry and left.

55
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I don't know how Liang Jinyuan dragged him here.

56
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
And he also brought a batch of information from Chongqing.

57
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
And this batch of information is now in the database of the cryptography research institute.

58
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,000
So we have to figure out how much the secret code of Xihe has been deciphered.

59
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I understand.

60
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I want to report back immediately.

61
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Wait for me to reply.

62
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
OK.

63
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I have information here.

64
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
The list of workers armed with violence and violence.

65
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
You said before that there was no problem with this danger.

66
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I am still not sure.

67
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
So I used all the information I had to investigate him.

68
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
On the surface, he is a big star.

69
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
But there is one thing I still think there is a problem.

70
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Lin Changying?

71
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I just investigated this person.

72
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Lin Changying is an actor from the Huaxia Film Company.

73
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
He died when the party organized the workers movement that year.

74
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
All the interrogation materials related to him are visible.

75
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
He is very likely to be a Communist.

76
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
What does he have to do with the Black Death?

77
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
What does he have to do with the Black Death?

78
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
The key is here.

79
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
He is in the same crew.

80
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
How could it be that there is no relationship at all?

81
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Just like the one named Hongyu.

82
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
He is like a Communist in the previous group.

83
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
He is very sensitive about the Black Death.

84
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
If this Black Death is just a female actor without any other identity.

85
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
How could he do all this so well?

86
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I must remind you.

87
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
For the military, the Communist is much more terrible than the Han people.

88
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
OK. I understand.

89
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
But the most important thing now is the Western Revolution.

90
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I have to go buy cake for Ding Yi.

91
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
If Xian Biyun is a Communist.

92
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
You and him are so close.

93
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
By then, your father will not be able to protect you.

94
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
It's harder to escape.

95
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
And the one who will die first is Ding Yi.

96
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
The White Death is very experienced.

97
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I'm afraid he discovered the spy before I did.

98
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
So he gave up Yulan and left in time.

99
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
But this also means that

100
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
the only way he could communicate with the organization was exposed.

101
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
He will not try to contact again.

102
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:29,000
The Anti-Lotting Party Committee informed us about some of Bai Yi's situation.

103
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Except that he used to work for the Northeast Guards.

104
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
He is not the only one who has been in contact with the organization.

105
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
He used to work for the Northeast Guards.

106
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
There is another important information.

107
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
He has severe stomach disease.

108
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Lao Hei once applied to the Party Committee to control the medicine for stomach ulcers.

109
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Then I will find a way to search for the relevant medical records.

110
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Chief Yang, Da Zuo said that he was also interested in the matter of the Chinese Transfusion Office.

111
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
How do you and Ning Ning plan to investigate?

112
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
This is your job.

113
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
You don't have to report it.

114
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Da Zuo only wants to know the result.

115
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
But if we investigate, Dong Xuan Si...

116
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
That's your father.

117
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I'm afraid he will not be able to protect you.

118
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I'm afraid he will not be able to protect you.

119
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I'm afraid he will not be able to protect you.

120
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
That's your father.

121
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Not Da Zuo's father.

122
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Okay, Lao Liang.

123
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Did you catch him?

124
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
You should catch him next time.

125
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
If you hurt yourself, I will be very sad.

126
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
It's okay.

127
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
It's okay.

128
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Do you know who I met at the education center today?

129
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Who?

130
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Director Xian Bi Yuan and Director Li.

131
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I met them at the education center.

132
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I met them at the education center.

133
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I met them at the education center.

134
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I met them at the education center.

135
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I met them at the education center.

136
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Bi Yuan and Director Li.

137
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
You said...

138
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
You happened to appear at the scene of my arrest.

139
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Don't you suspect them?

140
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Did you think too much?

141
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I told Bi Yuan to buy me a ticket.

142
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
You...

143
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
You are too simple.

144
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
You look like a man.

145
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I'm sorry.

146
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
You didn't complete your mission.

147
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Will Director Zuo make it difficult for you?

148
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
It's not difficult for me.

149
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I know what this old man wants.

150
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I found something interesting at the scene of my arrest.

151
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Do you want to hear it?

152
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
What is it?

153
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I found that Bai Ye...

154
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
He is a phoenix who has been broken.

155
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
He has limited value.

156
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
But the street person behind him is very important.

157
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I can put a long line and catch a big fish.

158
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
That fishing line is a long line under the Communist Party Shanghai.

159
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Do you know that?

160
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I don't know.

161
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I have to find it at night.

162
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I have to find this guy.

163
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I remember Beethoven once said...

164
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Beethoven's people must be in an unfavorable situation.

165
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
In the past, they were defeated.

166
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I will find it.

167
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Madam, you are back.

168
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
What's wrong?

169
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
You just came back.

170
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
You are back.

171
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
What did you do this afternoon?

172
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
You just left this afternoon.

173
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
My stomach suddenly hurt.

174
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
So I came back.

175
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I made porridge for myself.

176
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I feel much better.

177
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
You came back alone?

178
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Dingyi, come with me.

179
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
It's not very light.

180
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Come in.

181
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Come in.

182
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Thank you.

183
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Miss Xian, don't be so polite.

184
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I did it willingly.

185
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Sit.

186
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Dingyi, I want to talk to you seriously.

187
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I officially introduced you to my family.

188
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
What?

189
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Are you surprised?

190
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Miss Xian, your family agreed to what you said to me.

191
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Does that mean I have hope to join you?

192
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:06,000
So I want to ask you about the fact that I helped him apply to join the party organization.

193
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Yes.

194
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
The organization agreed to his application.

195
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
But it still needs further testing.

196
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I understand what you mean.

197
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
After all these things,

198
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,000
my family thinks that they want you to be one of us.

199
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
But this is not that simple.

200
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Then what kind of procedures do you need?

201
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
For example, write an application.

202
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I'll write it now.

203
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Sit down.

204
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Dingyi, what is our family to you?

205
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Just like our group,

206
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
a group of people who are in the same boat,

207
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
get along like family.

208
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
They have the warmth of a family.

209
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
They also have the discipline of an iron.

210
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
In my opinion,

211
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
our family is a strong fortress.

212
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Every family is a stone on the fortress.

213
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
We are each other's eyes.

214
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
We are closely connected.

215
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
We live in a solid line of defense together.

216
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Behind this line of defense is the people.

217
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Dingyi, joining our family is not only a promise to ourselves,

218
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
but also a promise to our ancestors and the people.

219
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Are you really ready to be part of this fortress?

220
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I'm ready.

221
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Okay.

222
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Your situation is special.

223
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
You are a member of the fire department.

224
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I can be your host.

225
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I have to report the application to my family.

226
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
This is a serious matter.

227
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
When my family officially approves,

228
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I will prepare a new dress for you.

229
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I will put on a show for you.

230
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I understand.

231
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Miss Xian, can you tell me now

232
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
what you came here for?

233
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,000
We have a family member, Dai Hao Baiye.

234
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
He sneaked into the password research institute.

235
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
But he was exposed to the northeastern merchants.

236
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
His family is now out of contact with him.

237
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I entered the password research institute to find him

238
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
and meet him.

239
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
So you went to the securities exchange today

240
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
to meet him?

241
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Yes.

242
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
But today's action was exposed.

243
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
We didn't expect Liang Jinyuan to have so much information.

244
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Fortunately, the family members have given us new clues.

245
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
We know that comrade Baiye is in danger.

246
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
So I hope you can help me closely observe

247
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
in the password research institute.

248
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Shen Wanqing, Wang Zoukai, Dong Jinbo, and Liu Fangbai

249
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
are in danger.

250
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Don't worry.

251
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
This is the first task my family officially gave me.

252
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I will not let my family down.

253
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Any other questions?

254
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
In the future, if there is no outsider,

255
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
just the two of us,

256
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
can I call you comrade?

257
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I approve.

258
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Comrade Ding Yi.

259
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Who is it?

260
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Secretary Jiang.

261
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
What's the matter?

262
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Director Li has rested.

263
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
What can you tell me?

264
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
The new government's intelligence system

265
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
has been ordered to investigate the spies.

266
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Those who are not in the port this afternoon

267
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
and those who have left Sanyang

268
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
will be investigated.

269
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Please come with me, director Liang.

270
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Okay.

271
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Director Li.

272
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Director Li.

273
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I have told director Liang everything I should have.

274
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
He let me go.

275
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Yes.

276
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Mr. Li.

277
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Be careful, director.

278
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Director Li.

279
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Director Li.

280
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Mr. Li.

281
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Mr. Dong and Mr. Liu are here.

282
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
You two

283
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
are not in the research institute this afternoon.

284
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
It's my bad luck.

285
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
I had a bowl of noodles this afternoon.

286
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I lost my wallet and went to the police station.

287
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Who would have thought that the spies would choose this time?

288
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Who said no?

289
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I went out this afternoon.

290
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Fortunately, my wife called me and said that she was not feeling well.

291
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I went to the hospital to buy her medicine.

292
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Don't push.

293
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I can do it myself.

294
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I can do it myself.

295
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Mr. Li.

296
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Mr. Shen is here.

297
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Director Li.

298
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Mrs. Li.

299
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
You are here too.

300
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Director Shen went out this afternoon.

301
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I was not satisfied.

302
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
I was not satisfied.

303
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Miss Yi.

304
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Miss Yi and director Liang appeared together.

305
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I will come to you when I find out the truth.

306
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Director Liang.

307
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Director Liang.

308
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Director Liang.

309
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
It's almost noon.

310
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I'm sorry.

311
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Those who have been questioned can go back.

312
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I have a notice.

313
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,000
From today, you must go to Sanyangli.

314
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Understood.

315
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Understood.

316
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Director Shen, wait.

317
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Director Li.

318
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Mrs. Li.

319
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Please.

320
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Director Liang.

321
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
This afternoon,

322
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I went out this afternoon.

323
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
I went out this afternoon.

324
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I went out this afternoon.

325
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
You should know it clearly.

326
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
You should know it clearly.

327
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Why waste time?

328
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Why waste time?

329
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Ask again.

330
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I need to organize an official questionnaire report.

331
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I need to organize an official questionnaire report.

332
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I need to organize an official questionnaire report.

333
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Please cooperate with the captain of the arm.

334
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Director Liang, don't worry.

335
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
We will cooperate with the captain of the arm.

336
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Thank you.

337
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Erli.

338
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Come with me.

339
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Director Li.

340
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Erli.

341
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Let's go.

342
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Director Li.

343
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Mrs. Li.

344
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Take care.

345
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Close the door.

346
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Close the door.

347
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Director Liang.

348
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Where did you go this afternoon?

349
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
I was not in the research institute this afternoon.

350
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Mr. Li said he wanted to eat the cake that the captain made.

351
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
I bought it for him.

352
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Do you know where he went when he thought I was not in the research institute this afternoon?

353
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Director Liang, I really don't know.

354
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
I am Mr. Li's assistant.

355
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
He doesn't need to report to me wherever he wants to go, right?

356
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
But I know one thing.

357
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
When I went back to the research institute, he was already gone.

358
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
How is the relationship between Director Li and Li Huan?

359
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
No.

360
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
We don't have much contact.

361
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
That's strange.

362
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Director Li skipped work this afternoon.

363
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
He went to buy shares for him.

364
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Director Liang.

365
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Can you do this for the sake of Mrs. Li?

366
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
They are always playing mahjong together.

367
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,000
And you know Mrs. Li is in Mr. Li's heart.

368
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Okay, you can go back.

369
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
I can go now.

370
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Don't ask.

371
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Goodbye, Director Liang.

372
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
You usually use the dragon perfume.

373
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Mr. Li usually uses the dragon perfume.

374
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,000
I just use it.

375
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Good night.

376
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Good night, Yaosora.

377
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Director Shen, please sit.

378
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Director Li.

379
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Can you slow down?

380
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
It hurts.

381
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
I almost lost my head.

382
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Don't worry. Let me explain.

383
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
When we went to the institute today,

384
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
you were on my right.

385
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Suddenly Li Huan appeared on my left.

386
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
He took me away.

387
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Di Yi.

388
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Just let me go.

389
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
You didn't tell me about what happened today.

390
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
I have no preparation for Liang Jinyuan's interrogation.

391
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Are you really not afraid that I will say something bad to you?

392
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
And cause Liang Jinyuan's suspicion?

393
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
I haven't had time to explain to you.

394
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
I didn't expect them to...

395
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
I'm sorry.

396
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Let me ask you.

397
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:19,000
What is the purpose of the trade center?

398
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Say something!

399
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
I don't know.

400
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
I don't know.

401
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
The child...

402
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
I really don't know.

403
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
I don't know.

404
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Di Yi, you have to understand.

405
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Miss Xian and I have a certain trust.

406
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
You are like a piece of heaven.

407
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Whenever you are close to her,

408
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
this subtle balance will be broken.

409
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,000
We will all fall into the abyss of infinity and fall into the abyss.

410
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,000
So what should we do?

411
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
You have to take care of yourself.

412
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
I understand.

413
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Li Yun.

414
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
I didn't mean to.

415
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
I received a message two days ago

416
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
that the public butterfly is going to the trade center to hand over the head.

417
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
It's a good time to help him.

418
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
You should come.

419
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
I'm sorry.

420
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
I'm sorry.

421
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
I'm sorry.

422
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
I'm sorry.

423
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
It's good to help you and Mr. Lin.

424
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,000
You know that I have 800 new eyes.

425
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,000
I told him that you were going to buy shares for me.

426
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
You can't be unhappy with me because of this.

427
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
The milk is really growing.

428
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
You believe in the milk, right?

429
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
I don't care.

430
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
You have to think of me as soon as possible

431
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
if you want to buy shares for me.

432
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Forget it.

433
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
I bought it for you once

434
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,000
and almost got criticized by the old man as a public butterfly.

435
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
I dare not.

436
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Mrs. Liang,

437
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Miss Ye said she would not come today because she came to the market.

438
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
How can she not come today?

439
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
It's not easy to get a job today.

440
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
She didn't come, but she's in a hurry.

441
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Is Miss Ye okay?

442
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
I can use the painkiller that the old Chinese doctor prescribed.

443
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
It's very useful.

444
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
I'll send it to her.

445
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Why are you hiding?

446
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Mrs. Dong should be free today.

447
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Lin Huan, thank you for coming.

448
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Okay, I'll go and call her.

449
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
I'll wait for you.

450
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Stay away from Ye Aida.

451
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Why?

452
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
I think she's a good person.

453
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
What are you afraid of?

454
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
I tell you,

455
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
this woman has absolutely no problem.

456
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
I'll go.

457
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Last afternoon,

458
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Mr. Liang went to see her alone again.

459
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
That day, the stock exchange was too late.

460
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
What did he do?

461
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Buy stocks.

462
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
He said he didn't care about it at all when he played mahjong last time.

463
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
He didn't want to make more money.

464
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
It's okay to explain this kind of thing.

465
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
What's there to hide?

466
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
You don't know that

467
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
he has a white goose boyfriend.

468
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
He took a lot of money.

469
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
White geese are sensitive to identity.

470
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Can the director agree?

471
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Besides,

472
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,000
it's a good thing for a woman to put on a stock exchange.

473
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Don't be angry.

474
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Don't be angry.

475
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Is it delicious?

476
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
No.

477
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
I'll give you the best one.

478
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Miss Yi,

479
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
is your face okay?

480
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Miss Xian, what can I do for you?

481
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
I heard you came to the hospital.

482
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
You have a stomachache.

483
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
This medicine of mine has a very good effect on the pain.

484
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
I brought it to you on purpose.

485
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Thank you.

486
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Can I come in and have a seat?

487
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Miss Xian.

488
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Miss Xian.

489
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
By the way,

490
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,000
I have a foundation that has a very good coverage.

491
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
I'll send it to you later.

492
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
It's okay to be a little hurt.

493
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
When I worked in the Northeast,

494
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
I often had a cold on my face and hands.

495
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
It's okay.

496
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Miss Yi used to work in the Northeast?

497
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Yes.

498
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
I came to Xinjing after graduation from the Soviet Union.

499
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
I came to Shanghai this time

500
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,000
mainly to reunite with my father.

501
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Thank you.

502
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Miss Yi is also old.

503
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
In this way,

504
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Director Liang shouldn't have done this.

505
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
The day before yesterday, I went to the securities exchange

506
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
to buy stocks for Mrs. Liang.

507
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
She just treated me as a public butterfly.

508
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
How come you also listened to her?

509
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
I'm sorry.

510
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
I talked too much, Miss Yi.

511
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Miss Yi is not feeling well.

512
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
I won't bother you.

513
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
I think it's very close to Miss Yi.

514
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Miss Yi is very thoughtful.

515
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
We must move more in the future.

516
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Okay.

517
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Look.

518
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
It's on the edge.

519
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
This wife

520
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
was saved.

521
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
I'm sorry.

522
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Darling.

523
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Li Yun.

524
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
You dare to go out without a tie.

525
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Aren't you afraid of embarrassing yourself?

526
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Madam, I will be careful next time.

527
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
I will be careful next time.

528
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Is there a possibility to observe Ye?

529
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Okay.

530
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Thank you, Madam.

531
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Don't tire yourself too much at work.

532
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Remember to eat on time.

533
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
And take your medicine on time.

534
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
I will

535
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
obey your order.

536
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Okay.

537
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
There are so many people.

538
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
I'm so sad.

539
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Okay.

540
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Let's go to work.

541
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Be careful.

542
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Drive slowly.

543
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
I'm back.

544
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Sastya.

545
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
You are so happy.

546
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,000
I just came back from the headquarters.

547
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Director Li agreed to my plan to seduce Bai Ye.

548
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
He asked me to come back and investigate.

549
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
What's so happy about that?

550
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Bai Ye.

551
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Once I'm caught,

552
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,000
I will immediately send the head of the headquarters to the executive office.

553
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Then I have to catch him quickly.

554
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
What are you looking for?

555
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Did you forget what I told you?

556
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,000
If we send Changxian to catch Dayu,

557
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Bai Ye will definitely be on the street with him.

558
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
When we catch Bai Ye,

559
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
and this street man,

560
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:25,000
we can also get the Chinese Communist Party behind him.

561
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
At that time,

562
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
it's not impossible to get the head of the executive office

563
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,000
or the military department.

564
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Tell me how to get the answer.

565
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Calm down.

566
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Sit.

567
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
News came from Xinjing.

568
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:52,000
That old man will regularly buy a batch of special medicine for stomach ulcers.

569
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
But he didn't have stomach disease.

570
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
What does this mean?

571
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
It means this medicine is for Bai Ye.

572
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Bai Ye?

573
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
How about this?

574
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
You send some money to the headquarters

575
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
and get a test done in our research institute.

576
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Then we can find out who has stomach disease in our institute.

577
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Then we can get Bai Ye out.

578
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
That simple?

579
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
News came from Xinjing.

580
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
The head of the executive office was not in the institute that day.

581
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
He had stomach disease.

582
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,000
I have so many clues.

583
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
If I can't get Bai Ye out,

584
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,000
then your husband will be a dead man.

585
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Mr. Xing, go and have a look.

586
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Tomorrow morning at 9 o'clock, Renji Hospital will be held.

587
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,000
All members and family members of the institute will be there.

588
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
I'll be right back.

589
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Director Li.

590
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Miss Yi.

591
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Are you feeling unwell?

592
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
I'm fine.

593
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Thank you for your concern.

594
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
What are you doing?

595
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
I'm sorry, Director Li.

596
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Why are you so careless?

597
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Get up.

598
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Come in.

599
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,000
What's wrong with you these days?

600
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
You're not well.

601
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
I'm fine.

602
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
I'm fine.

603
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
I'm fine.

604
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
I'm fine.

605
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
I'm fine.

606
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
I'm fine.

607
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
I'm fine.

608
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
I'm fine.

609
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
You're not well.

610
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
It's Director Liang's fault.

611
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
He hit you because you did something wrong.

612
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
You've got the password.

613
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Don't bring your emotions into work.

614
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Who doesn't want to do it?

615
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
You resign.

616
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Director Li, you misunderstood.

617
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
I did something wrong.

618
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
I don't blame anyone.

619
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
And

620
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
I'm not bad at this job.

621
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
I'm just not good at it.

622
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
I'm really good at code breaking.

623
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Can you talk to Director Liang?

624
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Or let me go back to my father and help him?

625
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
I understand you, Miss Yi.

626
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
But do you understand me?

627
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Now I'm the only one who can confirm it.

628
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
If you still want to do it, do it well.

629
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Don't think about going back to the code breaking.

630
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
If you can't do it, resign.

631
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
I won't stop you.

632
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,000
When the sun rises

633
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:31,000
The first light will light up my path

634
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,000
My home is a maze

635
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:38,000
No direction and no way out

636
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Pain in my eyes

637
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:45,000
The fake play is really hard to explain

638
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Where is the wind going?

639
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Whose bed is shaking?

640
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,000
The heart is thinking

641
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:59,000
It's either you or me

642
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,000
He is watching

643
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:06,000
The night is so long

644
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Tears are falling

645
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:13,000
A bunch of wounds

646
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,000
He is watching

647
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:20,000
The shadow is wandering

648
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,000
The night is falling

649
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:27,000
The night is getting cold

650
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:31,000
He is watching

651
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:35,000
The night is so long

652
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Tears are falling

653
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,000
A bunch of wounds

654
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,000
He is watching

655
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,000
The shadow is wandering

656
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:52,000
The night is falling

657
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:56,000
The night is getting cold

658
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,000
The night is falling

659
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:06,000
The night is getting cold
