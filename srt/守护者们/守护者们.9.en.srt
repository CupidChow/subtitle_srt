Thank you for getting me dressed back.

00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,720
Hana, Ma, Hijiri, so noisy

with the Science Grand Master

9
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,760
What's up, boss?

10
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,760
We're fighting.

11
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,760
Hurry up, hurry up!

12
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,760
50 bucks.

13
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,760
I've seen a 500-dollar man before.

14
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,760
He's got a gun.

15
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:47,760
Hey, you're pretty good at this.

16
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,760
Pay attention, okay?

17
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,760
Okay.

18
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,760
What are you looking at? Go back to work.

19
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,760
Go back to work.

20
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,760
Come on, come on, come on.

21
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,760
Pick it up.

22
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,760
What's up?

23
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,760
I'm going home.

24
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,760
I'm going home.

25
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,760
Come on.

26
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,760
I'll buy you a drink.

27
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,760
Come on.

28
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,760
What's up?

29
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,760
I'm going home.

30
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,760
I'm going home.

31
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,760
I'm going home.

32
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,760
I'm going home.

33
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,760
I'm going home.

34
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,760
I'm going home.

35
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,760
I'm going home.

36
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,760
I'm going home.

37
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,760
I'm going home.

38
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,760
I'm going home.

39
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,760
I'm going home.

40
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,760
I'm going home.

41
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,760
I'm going home.

42
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,760
I'm going home.

43
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,760
I'm going home.

44
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,760
I'm going home.

45
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:53,760
I'm going home.

46
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,760
I'm going home.

47
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,760
I'm going home.

48
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,760
I'm going home.

49
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,760
I'm going home.

50
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,760
I'm going home.

51
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:59,760
I'm going home.

52
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,760
I'm going home.

53
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,760
I'm going home.

54
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,760
I'm going home.

55
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,760
I'm going home.

56
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,760
I'm going home.

57
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,760
Deng Yikang, what's wrong with you and Hongyu?

58
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,760
The wanted list has fallen into a fire.

59
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,760
They say it's the Communist Party.

60
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,760
Aren't they in a group?

61
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,760
They're doing revolution.

62
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,760
Stop it.

63
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,760
I'm not old enough.

64
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,760
It's a long story.

65
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,760
We'll have plenty of time to talk about it.

66
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,760
Now the most important thing is to find Hongyu.

67
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,760
And bring him to you.

68
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,760
You'll get him a train ticket.

69
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,760
We'll send him away.

70
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,760
Now in Shanghai,

71
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,760
the only person I can trust is you.

72
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,760
Whether I can see my mother alive,

73
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,760
it's up to you.

74
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:48,760
Your mother...

75
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,760
Your mother is my mother.

76
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,760
When we escaped from the Northeast,

77
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,760
she took out cotton clothes,

78
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,760
cotton clothes, and sewed them on.

79
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,760
Then I survived.

80
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,760
I still remember

81
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,760
she was always crying by my side.

82
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,760
I had to live well.

83
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,760
So,

84
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,760
we should meet.

85
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,760
Of course.

86
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,760
We're just friends.

87
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,760
Okay.

88
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,760
We'll meet in the Northeast.

89
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,760
Okay.

90
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,760
We've come a long way.

91
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,760
Leave the people in Shanghai to me.

92
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,760
I'll get you some food.

93
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,760
No, Shun'er.

94
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,760
We have food.

95
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,760
We can just eat.

96
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,760
We don't have to do this.

97
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,760
I'll get you some water.

98
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,760
Here.

99
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,760
Brother Ding Yu,

100
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,760
will Hongyu

101
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,760
be killed by the Japanese?

102
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,760
The Japanese are looking for him.

103
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,760
Yes.

104
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,760
They're looking for him.

105
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,760
Shun'er.

106
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,760
Hongyu.

107
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,760
Can you help me?

108
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,760
Shun'er,

109
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,760
do you remember my favorite cake?

110
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,760
I'll get you some milk.

111
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,760
Okay.

112
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,760
I'll get you some milk.

113
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:21,760
Okay.

114
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,760
I'll get you some milk.

115
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,760
Brother Shun,

116
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,760
when will you get on the train?

117
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,760
The police

118
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,760
are at the train station.

119
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,760
Why don't you wait for a while?

120
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,760
I'm a Japanese.

121
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,760
You can't leave.

122
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,760
Brother Shun,

123
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,760
when will you get on the train?

124
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,760
I'm a Japanese.

125
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,760
Don't move.

126
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:01,760
Do you know how many people know that

127
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,760
I can help you with this?

128
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,760
Let me help you.

129
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,760
Okay.

130
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,760
Let's go!

131
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,760
Let's go!

132
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,760
Put in 2 bottles of amazing milk.

133
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,760
The record says

134
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,760
that at least 3 novices

135
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:19,760
from India

136
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,760
will be able to survive

137
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,760
There are only three people in Shunde.

138
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,760
One is a woman.

139
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,760
The other is 80 years old.

140
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,760
The other one has been living in the same room.

141
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,760
You've already seen him.

142
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,760
Then think about it.

143
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,760
Are there any people from the Northeast?

144
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,760
About 20 people.

145
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,760
They arrived in Shanghai 20 years later.

146
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,760
There is one.

147
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,760
Huo Yue.

148
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,760
Huo Yue, wake up.

149
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,760
Huo Yue, wake up.

150
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,760
Huo Yue.

151
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,760
Wake up, Huo Yue.

152
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,760
Huo Yue, why are you here?

153
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,760
I'm here to exchange money with the Japanese.

154
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,760
I'll go get some food for you.

155
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,760
No need, Shun'er.

156
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,760
We have food.

157
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,760
I'll get some water.

158
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,040
Yep.

159
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,240
And birthday.

160
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,240
All right.

161
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,760
See you tomorrow.

162
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,320
I'm drunk.

163
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,840
In all of Shanghai now.

164
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,840
I'm feel pity for you.

165
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,840
漉堅一個。。快走。。

166
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,840
Shun'er, Shun'er is a liar.

167
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,300
Are you a liar?

168
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,360
Zhenya

169
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:47,380
очему-то

170
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:48,220
This is it.

171
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:55,820
See those who see me,

172
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,900
called to themas afraaf's team!

173
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:58,580
Yes.

174
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:03,460
Right,

175
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:05,300
they... they are� SBBs,

176
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:06,160
so they must give money to them.

177
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:09,560
Are the two gladiators Yama?

178
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:18,380
Run!

179
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:22,380
Run!

180
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:25,380
Run!

181
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:39,380
Run!

182
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:45,380

Go!

190
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:27,380
Brother Tianyi, run!

191
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:28,380
I want to go with you!

192
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:39,380
Brother Tianyi, listen to me!

193
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:41,380
I can only live once!

194
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:44,380
Don't turn around!

195
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:10,380
Run!

196
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:21,380
Biyun!

197
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:24,380
I've been waiting for you!

198
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:25,380
You're finally here!

199
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:28,380
A big star is different.

200
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:29,380
You look beautiful in everything.

201
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:31,380
Today,

202
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:32,380
there are many handsome men.

203
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:34,380
I'll introduce you to Ayk.

204
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:37,380
You don't know

205
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:38,380
how difficult it is

206
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:39,380
to make a date with a man.

207
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,380
You're so shy.

208
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:45,380
Here we are.

209
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:49,380
I won't go in with you.

210
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:09,380
Chief Wu Tian.

211
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:11,380
Xiang Xiaoyu,

212
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:12,380
you're here.

213
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:23,380
Where's Dazuo?

214
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,380
It's not easy for you to meet my boss.

215
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:30,380
It's not easy for you to meet me.

216
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:33,380
I'm sorry.

217
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:35,380
I'm sorry.

218
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:36,380
I'm sorry.

219
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:39,380
Give her some boba.

220
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:40,380
That's all right.

221
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:41,380
Yahya!

222
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:44,380
I'll send you there.

223
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:45,380
Dazuo,

224
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:46,380
don't forego it.

225
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:53,380
Dazuo.

226
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:56,380
Mr. M delta terminator

227
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:58,380
belacanato.

228
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:00,380
You are a traitor.

229
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:07,380
Li Yueci is a very good friend of yours.

230
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:12,380
And you have a close relationship with Li Yueci.

231
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:16,380
I think it's hard for me not to doubt you.

232
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:18,380
You are a traitor.

233
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:23,380
Miss Shen, you are a traitor.

234
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:36,380
If it's true, I will doubt you.

235
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:39,380
But the test was conducted that night.

236
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:44,380
The KMT and the Communist Party were both involved in the anti-terrorist operation.

237
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:48,380
This is why I doubt your identity.

238
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:57,380
Tell me, are you a KMT or a Communist Party?

239
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:06,380
Chief Wu Tian, it's a pity that you didn't come to our troupe as a screenwriter.

240
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:23,380
What? Does this mean that you want to restrict my freedom of life?

241
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,380
I want to know.

242
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:33,380
Chief Wu Tian knows that you are a KMT.

243
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:36,380
I can't see Chief Wu Tian.

244
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:40,380
I just want to know if you are ready to cooperate.

245
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:42,380
I know that the weather has changed.

246
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:45,380
It's hard to carry the umbrella.

247
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:52,380
But the hat you gave me is too big.

248
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:55,380
I can't carry it, Chief Wu Tian.

249
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:59,380
I can't carry it.

250
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:01,380
I can't carry it.

251
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,380
I can't carry it.

252
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:05,380
I can't carry it.

253
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:07,380
I can't carry it.

254
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:09,380
Chief Wu Tian.

255
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:15,380
Bring me the tea.

256
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:17,380
Yes.

257
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:21,380
Ju Hongyu.

258
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:24,380
We've caught him.

259
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:27,380
He's been taken away.

260
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:29,380
You look like a female star.

261
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:33,380
But you're actually a KMT.

262
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:36,380
I'm a KMT.

263
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:41,380
But I'm just a playboy who's been playing with his own life.

264
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:47,380
Hongyu is a Communist?

265
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:51,380
Impossible.

266
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:54,380
Hongyu is always the most timid.

267
00:18:56,380 --> 00:19:00,380
I'm afraid that if you don't catch him and make him confess,

268
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:04,380
he'll be too young to be able to keep up with you.

269
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:08,380
Chief Wu Tian.

270
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:11,380
This is too childish.

271
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:14,380
But Ju Hongyu is here.

272
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:19,380
You have a mysterious identity.

273
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:22,380
If you remember this one or two times,

274
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:27,380
I hope you can win the single-hand match.

275
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:30,380
Right?

276
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:33,380
Nonsense.

277
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:36,380
Everyone who comes to the troupe is here to talk business.

278
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:39,380
Where did you get this idea?

279
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:41,380
Miss Shen should be in.

280
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:46,380
Now is the critical time for the meeting.

281
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:50,380
A female star like you who has a strong voice,

282
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:53,380
if you don't have the feeling of lack,

283
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:56,380
we can't do it.

284
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:02,380
This is your last chance.

285
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:06,380
If we take the sword,

286
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:11,380
there will be no chance to turn the tide.

287
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:16,380
Miss Shen, don't say that.

288
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:21,380
Say that you're his last cup.

289
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:29,380
I'm sorry.

290
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:59,380
Hongyu!

291
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:01,380
Hongyu!

292
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:03,380
Hongyu!

293
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:05,380
Say something!

294
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:07,380
Hongyu!

295
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:09,380
Say something!

296
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:30,380
Hongyu!

297
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:32,380
Hongyu!

298
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:38,380
Run!

299
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:41,380
Run!

300
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:43,380
What do you want?

301
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:45,380
Come on!

302
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,080
What?

303
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:20,580
o

304
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:28,340
Ok ...

305
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:40,060
This drug product has already dead but they said somebody got the arguably eta visa when it was was he just

306
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:41,860
apart

307
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:45,860
Highness

308
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:49,080
This angel a

309
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:54,860
Ampoule

310
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:55,860
Now you can.

311
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:57,660
Now you can!

312
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:59,460
Now you can!

313
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:00,860
Come on.

314
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:03,460
I need money!

315
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:04,660
Give it to me.

316
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:09,860
Now you can.

317
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:12,260
I did it.

318
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:14,460
I did it.

319
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:17,460
Forgive me.

320
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:19,860
I did it.

321
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:22,260
I need money first.

322
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,260
First.

323
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:28,860
KLAIRPEL

324
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:56,040
Is it true?

325
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,000
Yeah.

326
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,740
I just want our son alive.

327
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:17,340
As a traitor to the Japanese,

328
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:22,640
let our son stay alive.

329
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:27,860
You want to live well,

330
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:33,860
then you can stab your own sister,

331
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:36,860
and betray your own people.

332
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:42,860
If everyone

333
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:48,860
is a coward like you,

334
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:50,860
then we

335
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:54,860
will be far away

336
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:57,860
from the country.

337
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:22,860
I want you to remember this for the rest of your life.

338
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:29,860
Hongyu was not killed by the Japanese,

339
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:36,860
but by you.

340
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:51,860
I want you to remember this for the rest of your life.

341
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:21,860
The rain is getting stronger.

342
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:26,860
This tea is really good.

343
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:29,860
Can I have another cup?

344
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:38,860
This woman is in pain.

345
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:41,860
She is not able to move.

346
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:44,860
She is not able to move.

347
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:47,860
This woman

348
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:50,860
is in pain.

349
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:01,860
Are you still in the mood for tea?

350
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:03,860
Don't go.

351
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:13,860
Do you want to get a book

352
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:17,860
and get me to commit the crime?

353
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:33,860
I want to go to the police.

354
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:51,860
Hongyu's application for membership

355
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:54,860
can also be promoted.

356
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:03,860
Hongyu's application for membership

357
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:06,860
can also be promoted.

358
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:13,860
I volunteer to join the Communist Party of China.

359
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,860
I will continue to work hard.

360
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:19,860
I will not give up.

361
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:22,860
I will not give up.

362
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:27,860
I will work hard for the Communist Party of China.

363
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:33,860
Miss Xin,

364
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:36,860
why are you so nervous?

365
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:42,860
I am just joking.

366
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:45,860
I am just joking.

367
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:48,860
Do you know what you are doing?

368
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:51,860
Don't you think it's familiar?

369
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:54,860
How would I know?

370
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:57,860
I have never seen it.

371
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:03,860
I am sorry.

372
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:10,860
Hey, bring me the case.

373
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:13,860
Yes.

374
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:30,860
Hongyu! Hongyu!

375
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:33,860
Hongyu, Hongyu

376
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:35,420
Hongyu

377
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:36,540
We should go

378
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:38,900
We should go

379
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,900
Come here

380
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:44,560
I don't know what to do, Hongyu is alone

381
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,980
It's too cold

382
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:48,420
Come back

383
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:49,780
It's too cold

384
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:50,740
Listen to me

385
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:54,180
Listen to me, he's not too cold, he's dead

386
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:56,340
Dead, do you understand? Dead

387
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:01,740
He's dead

388
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,960
Wait

389
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,520
Come back

390
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:33,740
Master Zhao Mu, please spend a day in prison.

391
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:35,740
This is a legend.

392
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:37,740
Good, good, you should go

393
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:38,380
and lie there in the prison.

394
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:43,860
How could you bring up

395
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:45,780
that fourth我覺得ayer,

396
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:47,380
that such a person

397
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:48,460
in the jail

398
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:49,300
never lives on in prison?

399
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:04,580
All right, all right, all right.

400
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:08,000
Do you understand what's going on?

401
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:12,580
Well, yes, I understand.

402
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:16,340
Everybody will report him when he comes back.

403
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,700
What will you report him about?

404
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:22,800
The transport activities he did during his stay in Shanghai.

405
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:26,460
Many many things.

406
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:30,760
The income tax,ño惜 analysis of the fuck-up sheet.

407
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:33,760
is the Communist Party.

408
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:37,760
When we were in the group,

409
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,760
he always made some

410
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,760
outspoken anti-Japanese remarks.

411
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:43,760
Miss Shen,

412
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,760
the whole group

413
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,760
knows you and Xiao Hongyu best.

414
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:48,760
He can tell you

415
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,760
everything he wants.

416
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,760
You must know everything about him.

417
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,760
You can go to hell.

418
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,760
Don't blame me.

419
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,760
Xiao Hongyu

420
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,760
is innocent.

421
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:14,760
Why does Shen Biyun

422
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,760
have to be a guest in the Japanese?

423
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,760
How dare he make me do all the dirty work?

424
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:19,760
Come in.

425
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,760
Pack up the food for the Communist Party

426
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,760
and send it to the house number 64.

427
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:26,760
Yes.

428
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:27,760
Hurry up!

429
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,760
It's not necessary for the whole group

430
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,760
to be blackmailed

431
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,760
because of him.

432
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:47,760
Miss Shen, just admit it.

433
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:52,760
Brother.

434
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,760
Brother.

435
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:00,760
But I'm really not a Communist.

436
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:06,760
You said

437
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,760
you're not a Communist.

438
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,760
Now Chen You,

439
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:12,760
Yu Yasa,

440
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,760
and Mi Ma are all blackmailers.

441
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:15,760
Hou You,

442
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,760
and Zhuhong are also Communist.

443
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,760
I'm so sorry

444
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,760
that you can't escape.

445
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:25,760
What else do you have to say?

446
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:27,760
Yes, learner.

447
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:31,760
We've marriage wydchuss.

448
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:33,760
Excellent.

449
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,760
Now we can talk.

450
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:54,760
そろ Bismi.

451
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:55,760
Fine.

452
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:01,760
You call that bitch out.

453
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:06,760
I dare to confront her face to face.

454
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:09,760
I want to see how this white-eyed man

455
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,760
will spill the dirty water on me.

456
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,760
Hongyu came here to escape.

457
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:29,760
He has no friends in Shanghai.

458
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,760
But now that you mention it,

459
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,760
I remember.

460
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,760
He seems to have a cousin.

461
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,760
I only remember

462
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,760
that he called her cousin

463
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,760
Ruanqing.

464
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:48,760
Have you seen her?

465
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:50,760
No.

466
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:53,760
Zhu Hongyu always goes to see her.

467
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,760
She never comes to the troupe.

468
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,760
We have never seen anyone.

469
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:12,760
It's me.

470
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,760
Have you got the information about that woman, Ruanqing?

471
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:21,760
Yes.

472
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:31,760
What?

473
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,760
I have no further information.

474
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,760
I see.

475
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:56,760
Thank you.

476
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:58,760
Miss Xia, the police are here.

477
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,760
Did you have a good time?

478
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:02,760
Yes.

479
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,760
I had a good time.

480
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:05,760
I have to go.

The Communist Party of China is here.

00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:30,700
The Communist Party of China

528
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:49,700
Mr. Chen, hello.

529
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:55,700
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.

530
00:40:55,700 --> 00:41:00,700
Mr. Chen, my name is Kanegane.

531
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:04,700
I'm Sasaki.

532
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:09,700

00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:25,700
I don't drink alcohol.

535
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:30,700
I'm sorry to tell you that I don't drink alcohol.

536
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:35,700
Takeda is a man of the Party.

537
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:40,700
Please forgive him for not being able to live.

538
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:45,700
Excuse me.

539
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:54,700
I'm sorry.

540
00:41:55,700 --> 00:42:00,700
Mr. Chen, I think you are the representative of the Shanghai women's movement.

541
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:05,700
I hope you will work with us.

542
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:10,700
I have a script written by the Daito-wa Cultural Association.

543
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:14,700

I want you to come to the show.

548
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:49,700
Manye's actresses are known in Manchuria, but I don't know if they will be recognized in Shanghai.

549
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:54,700
I thought about it a lot, and I thought you were the best for the main actress.

550
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:59,700
Of course, the Shanghai women's movement needs a representative.

551
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:44,700
I'm sorry.

552
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:49,700
