1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,360
As the

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:10,720
3000

3
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:17,840
the

4
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:22,880
burg

5
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:28,940
the

6
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:30,940
The Legend of Chusen

7
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:32,940
Episode 16

8
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:51,940
You've been away from the palace all day.

9
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:53,940
Don't tell me you went to the temple in the daytime.

10
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:56,940
I did have

11
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:58,940
a hard time speaking.

12
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:03,940
I had a stroke.

13
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:05,940
I went back

14
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:07,940
and took a few sips.

15
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:08,940
What?

16
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,940
Li Yue Se didn't say that.

17
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:15,940
He said you came back to report.

18
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:16,940
He's a bad person.

19
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,940
If he said that,

20
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:20,940
I wouldn't say he came back to report.

21
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,940
How could he report as a blind man?

22
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:27,940
I'm sorry.

23
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:32,940
I'm sorry.

24
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:34,940
I'm sorry.

25
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:36,940
I'm sorry.

26
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:37,940
I'm sorry.

27
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:39,940
I forgot.

28
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:40,940
I forgot.

29
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:44,940
He has a Charlie.

30
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:46,940
Yes, he has a Charlie.

31
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:49,940
Yes, Charlie.

32
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:52,940
I saw Charlie.

33
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:53,940
It was Charlie who sent the letter.

34
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:55,940
Do you have any evidence?

35
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:56,940
No.

36
00:02:58,940 --> 00:02:59,940
No.

37
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:02,940
No evidence.

38
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:05,940
If there's no evidence,

39
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:06,940
I can't help you.

40
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:08,940
He has no evidence.

41
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:09,940
He can frame me.

42
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:11,940
Evidence.

43
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:12,940
Evidence.

44
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:14,940
Evidence.

45
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:15,940
Evidence.

46
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:17,940
Let me think.

47
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:18,940
Evidence.

48
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:19,940
Evidence.

49
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:21,940
Evidence.

50
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:23,940
Let me think.

51
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:24,940
Evidence.

52
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:26,940
Evidence.

53
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:28,940
Evidence.

54
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:29,940
Evidence.

55
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:33,940
The one who has the evidence is the accomplice.

56
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:36,940
I know.

57
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:37,940
Ye Haida?

58
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:39,940
Ye Haida and her father,

59
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:40,940
Yi Xiuyuan,

60
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:42,940
their father and their father are accomplices.

61
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:43,940
Yi Xiuyuan,

62
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:45,940
he's always in the lock,

63
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:46,940
with a cold face,

64
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:47,940
ignoring everyone,

65
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:48,940
being sneaky.

66
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:51,940
Does he know that Ye Haida is dead?

67
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:52,940
Get him,

68
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:53,940
or he'll run away.

69
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:54,940
I told you before,

70
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:57,940
I'm their father and daughter.

71
00:03:58,940 --> 00:03:59,940
Not them.

72
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:03,940
Dong Qingbo, Liu Fangpei.

73
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:06,940
Although you sent them to execute a secret mission,

74
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:09,940
he might have secretly returned to the Three Kingdoms

75
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:10,940
and sent a message to the accomplice.

76
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:12,940
Liang...

77
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:15,940
Huang.

78
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:17,940
I want to take the punishment.

79
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,940
Shen Wanqing is the accomplice.

80
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:20,940
Huang,

81
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:21,940
what are you talking about?

82
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:22,940
What are you talking about?

83
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:24,940
When the incident happened,

84
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:27,940
my brother helped him to wipe the car.

85
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:28,940
There was blood in the car.

86
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,940
My brother was bewitched by it.

87
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:33,940
He died to cover him.

88
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:36,940
You killed my brother.

89
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:37,940
Huang, what's wrong with you?

90
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:38,940
What's wrong with you?

91
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:40,940
Are you possessed?

92
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:41,940
I'm your master.

93
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:43,940
Chief Liang, don't listen to him.

94
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:46,940
He must be irritated because his brother is dead.

95
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:47,940
Huang.

96
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:48,940
Don't touch me.

97
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:52,940
You're a murderer.

98
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:02,940
He hid something in the bank of the mainland.

99
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:04,940
Li Kuan.

100
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:05,940
He was in the next round.

101
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:09,940
I helped him to hide it.

102
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:13,940
He saw that I was stupid.

103
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:16,940
I was thinking

104
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:19,940
what's so good about a book?

105
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:21,940
So I took a peek.

106
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:24,940
I found a photo of the

107
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:27,940
secret code of the West Pavilion.

108
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:30,940
Chief Liang,

109
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:34,940
I don't know what book I'm reading.

110
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:35,940
I just stole the secret code

111
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:37,940
and some materials.

112
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:38,940
I want to sell them in the dark.

113
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,940
I want to make some money.

114
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,940
Those are all the things of the Kuomintang.

115
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:44,940
They have no loss to the new government.

116
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:47,940
I didn't take any of the things of the new government.

117
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:52,940
Li Kuan, why did you

118
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:54,940
frame me for this?

119
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:56,940
You want to kill me.

120
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:57,940
Chief Chen.

121
00:05:58,940 --> 00:05:59,940
Please.

122
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:00,940
Chief Liang.

123
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:01,940
Sit down.

124
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:07,940
Chief Liang.

125
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:08,940
Don't listen to him.

126
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:09,940
Chief Liang.

127
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:10,940
He...

128
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:12,940
He...

129
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:20,940
Liu'an,

130
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:21,940
go and get it.

131
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:26,940
Mu,

132
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:27,940
go to the Bank of China

133
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:29,940
and get the book he said.

134
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:31,940
The Bank of China only recognizes the chief's face.

135
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:38,940
It's okay.

136
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:39,940
I'll take two people

137
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,940
to take Miss Li with us.

138
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:43,940
Wait.

139
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:48,940
Since you've already broken off your relationship with your master,

140
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:51,940
you don't have to wear his clothes.

141
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:53,940
Give it back to him.

142
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:01,940
Give it back to me!

143
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:03,940
I'll pay you back with my life!

144
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:09,940
Give it back to me!

145
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:14,940
Give it back to me!

146
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:39,940
Chief Liang.

147
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:40,940
He is innocent.

148
00:07:58,940 --> 00:07:59,940
He was lying.

149
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:00,940
He framed me.

150
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:01,940
Chief Liang.

151
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:03,940
Chief Liang.

152
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:05,940
Liang Si Cheng.

153
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:08,940
Liang Si Cheng, I don't have it.

154
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:09,940
I just...

155
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:10,940
Do you want coffee?

156
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:11,940
No.

157
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:13,940
Liang Si Cheng.

158
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:21,940
Who are you selling this to?

159
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:22,940
The Communist Party?

160
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:24,940
I don't want to sell the Communist Party.

161
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:27,940
Even if I sell it to the Communist Party,

162
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,940
you can't say I'm a spy.

163
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:33,940
We can talk about the West Pavilion later.

164
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:48,060
If the Chinese

165
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,940
Liang Si Cheng, please forgive me.

166
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:03,940
Liang Si Cheng!

167
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:05,940
I...

168
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,940
Liang Si Cheng, please forgive me.

169
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:33,940
Liang Si Cheng, please forgive me.

170
00:09:58,940 --> 00:09:59,940
Huang Er.

171
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:00,940
Sir.

172
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:01,940
Thank you, sir.

173
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:03,940
It's chocolate.

174
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:05,940
Is it sweet?

175
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:06,940
It's so sweet.

176
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:08,940
Thank you, sir.

177
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:10,940
Huang Er.

178
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:12,940
Remember what I said.

179
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:15,940
If something happens to you,

180
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:19,940
tell me the thing that you hid in the bank in the mainland.

181
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:20,940
I can save your life.

182
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:25,940
Do you remember what I told you?

183
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:31,940
Listen to me.

184
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:37,940
Put it on.

185
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:02,940
Mr. Shen is right.

186
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:05,940
Li Huan.

187
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:09,940
You must live well.

188
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:26,940
The Imperial Army is looking for me.

189
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:31,940
Let me go.

190
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:44,940
Let me go.

191
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:02,940
Chief Liang!

192
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:03,940
Something's wrong, Chief Liang!

193
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,940
Li Huan ran away!

194
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:07,940
Chief Liang,

195
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:09,940
Li Huan attacked us.

196
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:11,940
He fell into the river in time.

197
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:12,940
Li Huan is a good swimmer.

198
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,940
Our captain took someone else to catch him.

199
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:15,940
Useless!

200
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:18,940
Li Huan ran away?

201
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,940
Chief Liang did a good job.

202
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:27,940
I don't think we need to talk about it anymore.

203
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:31,940
You should know that Li Huan is a spy.

204
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:34,940
What you should do now is to apply to the team,

205
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:53,260
search Li Huan and unseal the three-way

206
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:00,940
Do you think I'm stupid?

207
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:02,940
The spy is among you.

208
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:04,940
I'll get you out of here today.

209
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:05,940
Close the door!

210
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:12,940
Enough, Liang Xingran!

211
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:14,940
What else do you want?

212
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:17,940
The radio station was on the night.

213
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:18,940
You said he wasn't a spy.

214
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:20,940
Because you believed him.

215
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:21,940
Now Li Huan ran away.

216
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:22,940
Explain to me.

217
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:23,940
If they're not the spies,

218
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:25,940
who is the spy?

219
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:27,940
It's you!

220
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:31,940
You're the spy!

221
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:33,940
It's you!

222
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:34,940
I saw you!

223
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:35,940
You're going to get a beating!

224
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:37,940
You're the spy!

225
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:39,940
I saw it!

226
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:40,940
You're the spy!

227
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:46,940
I saw it!

228
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:49,940
You're the spy!

229
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:58,940
Shen Banqing, I have nothing to do with you!

230
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:00,940
Why did you frame me?

231
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:02,940
Professor Su,

232
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:04,940
the radio station is right in the middle of you and me.

233
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:06,940
I'm not the spy.

234
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:07,940
It's you!

235
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:13,940
Can you be responsible for what you say?

236
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:15,940
You framed me first.

237
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:17,940
You framed me first.

238
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:19,940
You framed me first.

239
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:21,940
You framed me first.

240
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:23,940
You framed me first.

241
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:24,940
You framed me first.

242
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:29,940
Even my students in the school

243
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,940
are all against me.

244
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:33,940
And you,

245
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:34,940
you don't know where you're coming from.

246
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:35,940
You're blind!

247
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:45,940
Director Liao, I have a report.

248
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:48,940
I know one thing.

249
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:50,940
I can prove that Shen Banqing is the spy.

250
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:51,940
I'm a spy.

251
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:54,940
I was resting in my bed around 6 o'clock today.

252
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:56,940
The light on the TV flashed.

253
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:57,940
It was only a few minutes.

254
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,940
The radio station in Sanyangli has been in a state of aging.

255
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:02,940
It can't withstand the high power of radio waves.

256
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:05,940
But the one who shared the radio with Mr. Li

257
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,940
was Shen Banqing.

258
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:12,940
So I guess

259
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:14,940
Shen Banqing was sending the radio at that time.

260
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:17,940
You're talking nonsense!

261
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:21,940
What do you mean?

262
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:23,940
Power supply in the Chinese industry is always a problem.

263
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:25,940
It's common for the power to be unstable.

264
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,940
But the time at 6 o'clock

265
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:29,940
is too coincidental.

266
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:31,940
Fine. I'll report it too.

267
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:33,940
Director Liao, you told me before

268
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:35,940
that the spy you were looking for was Shen Banqing.

269
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:37,940
He's the spy!

270
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:38,940
A very serious spy!

271
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:39,940
He's the spy!

272
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:42,940
I heard his cough in the bathroom of the research institute.

273
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:46,940
He must have used some method

274
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:47,940
to get through that body check.

275
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:48,940
That's right, Mr. Li.

276
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:49,940
It's the spy.

277
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:50,940
Director Liao,

278
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:52,940
it's the opium and the liqueur

279
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:54,940
mixed together into a strong painkiller.

280
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:55,940
He must have drunk this

281
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:57,940
to cover his stomachache.

282
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:58,940
Once we went downstairs

283
00:15:58,940 --> 00:15:59,940
and passed by,

284
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:01,940
he had this kind of smell of a stinging nose.

285
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:03,940
It's the smell of opium.

286
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:04,940
It must be him.

287
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:05,940
You're talking nonsense!

288
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:14,940
Mr. Li, wake up.

289
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:21,940
What else do you have to say?

290
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:25,940
I'll fight you!

291
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:34,940
Let go!

292
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:45,940
Mr. Li!

293
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:46,940
Mr. Li!

294
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:50,940
Director Liao, save Mr. Li!

295
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:04,940
Shen Banqing!

296
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,940
Mr. Li, you'll get stabbed to death!

297
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:07,940
Shut up!

298
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:10,940
Get out of my way!

299
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:14,940
I want you to die!

300
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:15,940
Director Liao!

301
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:17,940
Mr. Li...

302
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:28,940
Save me!

303
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:31,940
Save me!

304
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:37,940
Save me!

305
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:46,940
No!

306
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:54,940
Motherfucker!

307
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:15,940
No!

308
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:46,940
No!

309
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:48,940
No!

310
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:50,940
No!

311
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:52,940
No!

312
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:54,940
No!

313
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:56,940
No!

314
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:58,940
No!

315
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:00,940
No!

316
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:02,940
No!

317
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:04,940
No!

318
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:06,940
No!

319
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:08,940
No!

320
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:10,940
No!

321
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:12,940
No!

322
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:14,940
No!

323
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:17,940
Shen Banqing, you bastard!

324
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:40,940
Yang Seon!

325
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:44,940
Stop!

326
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:56,940
Is this the result you gave me?

327
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:00,940
The attack on the North is over.

328
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:02,940
So you just want to do it?

329
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:08,940
You should have arrested him and disbanded the Shanghai Communist Party's underground committee!

330
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:21,940
The information about the man who confirmed the attack on the North is in the document!

331
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:27,940
Mr. Li, I'm sorry to bother you.

332
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:32,940
I heard your wife is in the hospital.

333
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:35,940
I'll take her to the hospital right away.

334
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:36,940
I'm sorry.

335
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:41,940
Mr. Li, go to the hospital.

336
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:07,940
Mr. Li, go to the hospital.

337
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:21,940
Mr. Liang.

338
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:36,940
No!

339
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:07,940
Mr. Li, calm down.

340
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:09,940
What happened?

341
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:24,940
What should I ask?

342
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:27,940
What is Mr. Liang doing?

343
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:32,940
Liang Jingyuan.

344
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:34,940
Liang Jingyuan.

345
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:36,940
You are so greedy.

346
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:39,940
You want to kill me with the bow and arrow?

347
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:42,940
I thought you were just dissatisfied with my work.

348
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:45,940
I didn't expect you to kill me.

349
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:49,940
Mr. Liang.

350
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:51,940
Mr. Liang.

351
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:53,940
Mr. Liang.

352
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:55,940
I'm a member of the Eastern Courtyard.

353
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:57,940
But I'm accused by this man.

354
00:22:58,940 --> 00:22:59,940
I don't know if it's because of his personal meaning.

355
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:03,940
Or someone gave him an order to give him the power.

356
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:04,940
If he has such power,

357
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:08,940
it's a big sin.

358
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:12,940
It's a challenge to the Dongyans.

359
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:16,940
It's a humiliation to the entire Japanese royal family.

360
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:22,940
I'm sorry.

361
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:24,940
I didn't mean it.

362
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:27,940
I was not able to manage the situation.

363
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:30,940
I'm sorry for inviting such a situation

364
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:33,940
and I apologize on behalf of the Japanese army.

365
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:39,940
Liang Jingyuan.

366
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:43,940
At this rate, you will not be the director of the research institute.

367
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:45,940
Mr. Li.

368
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:47,940
You are the head of the research institute.

369
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:52,940
I want to leave the research institute to you.

370
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:55,940
Mr. Li.

371
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:58,940
Mr. Li is the director of the research institute.

372
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:01,940
Mr. Li.

373
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:14,940
Hurry up.

374
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:17,940
Gather all the spy and the leader of the Korean War.

375
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:19,940
Bring them all to the table.

376
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:21,940
The main task is to get them all.

377
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:23,940
Hurry up.

378
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:31,940
Hurry up.

379
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:58,940
Luo Jingyuan.

380
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:01,940
Luo Jingyuan.

381
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:31,940
Luo Jingyuan.

382
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:02,940
Luo Jingyuan.

385
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:31,940
Luo Jingyuan.

386
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:01,940
Mr. Shen.

387
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:03,940
This afternoon, you went out.

388
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:06,940
Mr. Li.

389
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:07,940
Mr. Li, stop asking.

390
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:11,940
Mr. Li.

391
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:13,940
Mr. Li.

392
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:15,940
Mr. Li.

393
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:17,940
Mr. Li.

394
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:19,940
Mr. Li.

395
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:21,940
Mr. Li.

396
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:23,940
Mr. Li.

397
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:25,940
Mr. Li.

398
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:27,940
Mr. Li.

399
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:29,940
Mr. Li.

400
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:31,940
Mr. Li.

401
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:35,940
You are not angry with me?

402
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:37,940
You are angry with me?

403
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:51,940
How do you feel?

404
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:56,940
Does it hurt?

405
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:01,940
It's okay.

406
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:05,940
Are you okay, sir?

407
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:06,940
It's okay.

Google Translate

446
00:31:54,200 --> 00:32:00,440
Google Translate

447
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:02,040
Yes, sir.

448
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:28,100
Accompany yourself to better watch the boat.

449
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:39,440
He used his life to teach me how to work as a communist.

450
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:43,440
I want to know his next mission.

451
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:48,440
Please allow me to complete it for him.

452
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:57,440
I want to be a white wolf.

453
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:04,440
I made him my companion over time.

454
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,940
I will go so he can learn from me.

455
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:09,940
Do I have contacts?

456
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:14,940
Goodbye white wolf.

457
00:33:44,940 --> 00:34:07,940
My sister.

458
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:12,940
Uncle Wu, please forgive me.

459
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:20,940
Actually, my master had expected this day.

460
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:24,940
So he told me how to escape from my brother and me in advance.

461
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:30,940
He asked me to give the mainland bank the evidence that he was a spy to give to Liang Jingyuan.

462
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:32,940
Liang Zuo...

463
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:34,940
Huang Er.

464
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:36,940
I want to be punished.

465
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:39,940
100,000 is a bow.

466
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:43,940
Even if his identity is exposed,

467
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:48,940
you can save me and my brother.

468
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:51,940
At that time,

469
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:55,940
I knew he was determined to die.

470
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:02,940
But I didn't expect that day to come so soon.

471
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:03,940
Huang Er.

472
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:10,940
I can't even see him for the last time.

473
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:14,940
That night,

474
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:18,940
my master told me that the information he wanted to pass on was in his jacket.

475
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:23,940
I knew I had to use the way to betray my master to bring the information out.

476
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:30,940
I thought I had to leave successfully and take out the things from the mainland bank.

477
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:34,940
You and my master can leave the identity of Bai Ye to me.

478
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:43,940
But I didn't expect that the information was still not taken out.

479
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:47,940
My master used such a cruel way.

480
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,940
My master knows you are a good boy.

481
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:53,940
Don't say anything else.

482
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:56,940
Take good care of your brother.

483
00:35:57,940 --> 00:36:00,940
He is a fool.

484
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:06,940
If your master is gone,

485
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:08,940
don't be afraid.

486
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:11,940
Live bravely.

487
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:16,940
Open your eyes.

488
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:23,940
Look at the new world for your master.

489
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:49,940
In fact, my brother and I knew what kind of path my master chose from the moment we started following him.

490
00:36:56,940 --> 00:37:01,940
The victory of the Yellow River War solved the biggest problem.

491
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:09,940
The most advanced and the most determined in the war, the most thorough army of the revolution, the New Fourth Army, were all combined.

492
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:13,940
They could get better cooperation and greater development.

493
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:20,940
They made the base of the anti-Japanese base in the north of the Subei and the base of the anti-Japanese base in the north of the Huabei.

494
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:27,940
They made the base of the anti-Japanese base in the north of the Subei and the base of the anti-Japanese base in the north of the Huabei.

495
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:31,940
They made the first step of the Chinese revolution.

496
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:35,940
They made the first step of the Chinese revolution.

497
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:36,940
I declare.

498
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:51,940
I declare.

499
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:57,940
I volunteer to join the Communist Party of China.

500
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:02,940
I volunteer to join the Communist Party of China.

501
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:08,940
I will stick to the party's rules and regulations.

502
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:14,940
I do not fear difficulties and sacrifices.

503
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:22,940
I will fight until the end for the Communist Party.

504
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:34,940
I'm sorry.

505
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:36,940
I'm sorry.

506
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:38,940
I'm sorry.

507
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:40,940
I'm sorry.

508
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:42,940
I'm sorry.

509
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:44,940
I'm sorry.

510
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:46,940
I'm sorry.

511
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:48,940
I'm sorry.

512
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:50,940
I'm sorry.

513
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:52,940
I'm sorry.

514
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:54,940
I'm sorry.

515
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:56,940
I'm sorry.

516
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:58,940
I'm sorry.

517
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:00,940
I'm sorry.

518
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:03,940
Read the book first.

519
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:05,940
Then read the book.

520
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:09,940
I've already decided.

521
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:11,940
I'll just go with my heart.

522
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:13,940
I'll just go with my heart.

523
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:15,940
You have to go your own way.

524
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:19,940
What is that?

525
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:21,940
We'll find it eventually.

526
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:24,940
Sun Wei Nian.

527
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:26,940
Please remember this.

528
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:29,940
Okay.

529
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:31,940
Can you sign for me?

530
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:01,940
I'm sorry.

531
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:17,940
You really decided to stay at the secret research institute?

532
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:19,940
To replace comrade Bai Ye?

533
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:21,940
To complete the task given to him?

534
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:28,940
I have to support you.

535
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:33,940
The hardest part is to walk from the stage to the stage.

536
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:35,940
Only now do I know.

537
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:41,940
The hardest part is to go to the stage to the stage.

538
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:48,940
My husband, Hong Ye, and Bai Ye.

539
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:51,940
They will never die for nothing.

540
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:54,940
I will be like them.

541
00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:57,940
The heart is like the knee.

542
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:00,940
The fist is like the shoulder.

543
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:06,940
The first step in implementing this plan

544
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:11,940
is to make a clean break with Gu Yao Shan.

545
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:26,940
Gu Yao Shan

546
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:57,940
Gu Yao Shan

547
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:26,940
Gu Yao Shan

548
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:48,940
Shen Wan Qing may be dead,

549
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:50,940
but she has already destroyed the Western Pavilion.

550
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:53,940
The Western Pavilion's password is no longer safe.

551
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:55,940
It must be withdrawn.

552
00:42:56,940 --> 00:43:00,940
The new password will be sent to the third stage in the next two days.

553
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:04,940
Regarding this mission,

554
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:08,940
I am very satisfied with your position.

555
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:10,940
I am a secretary.

556
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:13,940
I personally sent Gu Si Ling back to his home.

557
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:16,940
He is safe now.

558
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:18,940
You can rest assured.

559
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:22,940
I know you have a lot of discontent with the military.

560
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:24,940
But since you came up with this plan,

561
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:26,940
there is no way to turn back.

562
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:29,940
The whole Gu family and Ding Yi's life and death

563
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:31,940
are all recorded in your position.

564
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:33,940
You know that, right?

565
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:54,940
Gu Yao Shan

566
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:24,940
Gu Yao Shan

567
00:44:24,940 --> 00:44:26,940
Gu Yao Shan

568
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:28,940
Gu Yao Shan

569
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:30,940
Gu Yao Shan
