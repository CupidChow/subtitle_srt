1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,880
MIN grandmother

2
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:12,280
Christmas

3
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:28,920
We'll meet again.

4
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,600
Lisa.

5
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:37,440
I have to survive.

6
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:41,040
We would die together.

7
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,040
I'm very sorry.

8
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,040
Hmm.

9
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:48,040
But Mr. Takeda want to see you.

10
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,040
Miss, I apologize for the trouble.

11
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,040
Hmm.

12
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,040
Mr. Li.

13
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,040
Oh.

14
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,040
Can I help you?

15
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:07,040
No, madam. But I appreciate it.

16
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,040
Charlie.

17
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,040
Mr. Li.

18
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,040
Take off your clothes.

19
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,040
Yes.

20
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,040
Get out.

21
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:01,040
Mr. Takeda is waiting for you.

22
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,040
Please.

23
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,040
Ah.

24
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,040
I'm looking for you.

25
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,040
I'm very sorry about the incident.

26
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,040
I was wrong.

27
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,040
I'm sorry, Mr. Li.

28
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,040
I don't want to be a burden to you.

29
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:14,040
I never talk to people who don't respect me.

30
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,040
Only talk about soldiers.

31
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,040
Don't be angry.

32
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,040
What are you doing?

33
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,040
Are you crazy? You scared me.

34
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,040
A horse's eyes can't see things.

35
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,040
Although the sense of smell is not there,

36
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,040
it is more sensitive than others.

37
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:01,040
But it can't avoid sudden attacks.

38
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,040
So your reaction just now

39
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,040
exposed yourself.

40
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,040
Wu Tian never do this to Mr. Li.

41
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,040
He doesn't dare.

42
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,040
He will.

43
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,040
What do you mean?

44
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,040
Since the day Li Ye was killed,

45
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,040
he has been gone for three days.

46
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,040
With Wu Tian's personality,

47
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,040
he will be suspicious.

48
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,040
He will try all kinds of ways.

49
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,040
Mr. Li.

50
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:32,040
I have apologized to him on behalf of Jinzhang.

51
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,040
You still can't forgive him.

52
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,040
You still can't forgive him.

53
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,040
Give me.

54
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,040
Continue to do it.

55
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,040
Excuse me, sir.

56
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:54,040
Those Japanese come up with Mr. Williams' guise.

57
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:56,040
Could you stop them before they leave?

58
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,040
I repeat.

59
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:04,040
I never talk to people who don't respect me.

60
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,040
Wu Tian.

61
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:12,040
If you think your actions are useful to me,

62
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:17,040
will I still sit here?

63
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,040
Will I still sit here?

64
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,040
It's useful.

65
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:36,040
Now you are willing to talk to me.

66
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,040
Right?

67
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:44,040
If Wu Tian can also take the present situation

68
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,040
as a conversation,

69
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:49,040
we really have nothing to talk about.

70
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,040
Thank you, Wu Tian.

71
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,040
I think our cooperation

72
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,040
should really be cut off.

73
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,040
I understand.

74
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,040
This is a public conversation.

75
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,040
Please hand over Mr. Williams' guests.

76
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,040
Mr. Li.

77
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,040
Mr. Li.

78
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,040
Get out of the way.

79
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,040
Don't worry.

80
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,040
Please calm down.

81
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,040
We are friends, okay?

82
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,040
Mr. Li.

83
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,040
Mr. Li.

84
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,040
Mr. Li.

85
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,040
Don't be afraid.

86
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:21,040
I have just finished the competition.

87
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:25,040
I have won three years of the competition.

88
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:30,040
I hope you can reconsider

89
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,040
the cooperation with the Ministry of?

90
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,040
I'm sorry.

91
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:46,040
I scared him because he is not strong enough.

92
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,040
In front of so many people,

93
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,040
I embarrassed him.

94
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:55,040
He should not be alive in the Japanese army.

95
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,040
Mr. Li.

96
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:09,040
My business has been very clear.

97
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,040
Tomorrow night,

98
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:13,040
I will set up a meeting in the big city.

99
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,040
I will hold a meeting with you.

100
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,040
We will start a new cooperation.

101
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:23,040
I hope you will not be worried.

102
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,040
Mr. Li.

103
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,040
Hey.

104
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,040
Let's go.

105
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,040
Yes.

106
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,040
Tomorrow night,

107
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,040
we will go back to the hotel.

108
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,040
Wu Tian said he would set up a meeting.

109
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,040
Get in the car.

110
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,040
What are you looking at?

111
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,040
So ugly.

112
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,040
Kill him.

113
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,040
You are so timid.

114
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,040
Don't scare me.

115
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,040
I'm not.

116
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,040
You are so timid.

117
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,040
Don't scare me.

118
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,040
You just said

119
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,040
you have a message for Mr. Wang.

120
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,040
What is it?

121
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,040
Mr. Wu.

122
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,040
Come on.

123
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,040
Be careful.

124
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,040
Mr. Wu.

125
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:24,040
Take him inside first.

126
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,040
I'm sorry.

127
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,040
What's wrong with Miss Xian?

128
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,040
Wu Tian almost shot me in the first mission.

129
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,040
This is your plan.

130
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,040
Miss Xian should know

131
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:24,040
that what happened today was an accident.

132
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:27,040
It's a coincidence that Ding Yi can live today.

133
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,040
Thank you for your help.

134
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,040
But we have something to say.

135
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,040
Those people

136
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,040
who left your super-life group

137
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,040
are the only ones

138
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,040
left between me and Ding Yi.

139
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,040
So you are betting his life.

140
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,040
If this is your plan,

141
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,040
you'd better let him go back to his hometown.

142
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,040
So you never bet

143
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,040
in Miss Xian's work?

144
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,040
Yes.

145
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,040
Miss Xian.

146
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,040
I can only promise you one thing.

147
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,040
If there is another gun

148
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:21,040
I will still be in front of him.

149
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,040
If Miss Xian is fine,

150
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,040
then you can go back.

151
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,040
Go.

152
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,040
Go.

153
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,040
So Ding Yi really

154
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,040
is a drunkard?

155
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,040
Yes, he doesn't want to be a human.

156
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,040
I see.

157
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,040
I won't agree to cancel

158
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,040
the operation of the Dado Hotel tomorrow.

159
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,040
I don't agree either.

160
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,040
Even though Ding Yi is talented,

161
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,040
he never received systematic training.

162
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,040
He will definitely show his flaws

163
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,040
if he stays here for too long.

164
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,040
Besides,

165
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,040
he is just a little fool.

166
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,040
He has no quality

167
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,040
as a intelligence officer.

168
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,040
Today's fact has proved

169
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,040
that our operation

170
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:41,040
is a complete failure.

171
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,040
I think I have explained it

172
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,040
to you two very clearly.

173
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,040
Today's operation

174
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:48,040
was very successful.

175
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:50,040
Not only did it not expose his identity,

176
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,040
but also indirectly let Wutian kill

177
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,040
a Japanese soldier.

178
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,040
Mr. Wei, you have received

179
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,040
professional intelligence training.

180
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,040
Don't you know

181
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,040
that one of the principles of the intelligence system

182
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,040
is not to wait for coincidence and luck?

183
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,040
But I also want to tell you that

184
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,040
today's matter

185
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,040
once again proves

186
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,040
that he has the ability

187
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,040
of a special agent

188
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,040
to respond to the situation.

189
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,040
Yang Shan,

190
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,040
what did you promise me

191
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,040
before the operation started?

192
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,040
He said I promised you

193
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:19,040
to use Wutian's trust in Li Yue Se

194
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,040
and tell him that the password was leaked

195
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,040
and to replace it.

196
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:24,040
This is the most critical step tomorrow.

197
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,040
I didn't mean that.

198
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,040
I mean that

199
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,040
even if the plan fails,

200
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,040
it's just

201
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,040
a group of people who died

202
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,040
and ran away.

203
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,040
It's not a big loss for us.

204
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,040
But what about you now?

205
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,040
There will be no loss now.

206
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,040
The plan will not fail.

207
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,040
People will not die.

208
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,040
And he doesn't know your identity,

209
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,040
doesn't know my identity,

210
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,040
and doesn't know where the strong point is.

211
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,040
Even if he is questioned,

212
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,040
what can he offer?

213
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,040
But I tell you,

214
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,040
you are now acting with him

215
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,040
as an assistant.

216
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,040
He is so drunk today.

217
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,040
What if he has a miscarriage?

218
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,040
He also put yourself in it.

219
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,040
How can I tell your father?

220
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,040
Yang Shan,

221
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,040
Commander Gu is my superior.

222
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,040
He has been kind to me.

223
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:19,040
He has given you to me.

224
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,040
If something happens to you,

225
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,040
I really can't tell your father.

226
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,040
Well, Mr. Yang,

227
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,040
I personally reported to Chongqing.

228
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,040
I will bear all the consequences

229
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,040
of this action alone.

230
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,040
I will not die.

231
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,040
If you still don't believe me,

232
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,040
I will personally tell my father

233
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,040
the situation by dawn.

234
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,040
Don't say that.

235
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:45,040
You are the only heir of the Gu family.

236
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,040
You are the only one.

237
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,040
Your father will not agree

238
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,040
to your risk.

239
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,040
This is what happened

240
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,040
between my father and me.

241
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:56,040
Don't worry, Mr. Yang.

242
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,040
Just make up for it.

243
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,040
Young man, you don't know

244
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,040
that I don't take risks when I do big things.

245
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,040
Young man.

246
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,040
Young man.

247
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,040
Young man.

248
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,040
What's wrong?

249
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,040
Are you afraid that I will run away?

250
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,040
Boss, two more bowls of noodles.

251
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,040
Okay.

252
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,040
I am not afraid.

253
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,040
I am not afraid.

254
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,040
I am not afraid.

255
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,040
I am not afraid.

256
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,040
I am not afraid.

257
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,040
I am not afraid.

258
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,040
I am not afraid.

259
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,040
I have never been so afraid

260
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:11,040
as I was last night.

261
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,040
I am really going to cry.

262
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,040
Do you know what I regret the most last night?

263
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,040
I should have given you

264
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,040
the bowl of noodles I made last night.

265
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,040
Even if I die,

266
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,040
I have to make a bun.

267
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,040
No matter how big the world is,

268
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,040
we will eat it.

269
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,040
The noodles are here.

270
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,040
Try it.

271
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,040
It's better than the big snail you arranged for me.

272
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,040
How did I find that

273
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,040
when I met you,

274
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,040
there was nothing good?

275
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,040
I just wanted to be with you.

276
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,040
I just wanted to be with you.

277
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,040
Come on.

278
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,040
Why are you looking at me like that?

279
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,040
I am not doing this for you.

280
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,040
I am doing this for you.

281
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,040
I am doing this for my mother.

282
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:27,040
I am doing this for my mother.

283
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,040
I am doing this for my mother.

284
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,040
Yes, yes, yes.

285
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,040
Okay, okay, okay.

286
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,040
I am a teacher.

287
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,040
I really can't teach him.

288
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,040
You are a father.

289
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,040
You have to talk to him.

290
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,040
This...

291
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,040
He is here.

292
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,040
I will give him the phone.

293
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,040
Okay, okay, okay.

294
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,040
Come on, your father.

295
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,040
Father.

296
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:53,040
Yuan Zhong has told me about your plan.

297
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,040
How sure do you think you are?

298
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,040
To be honest,

299
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,040
I am not sure.

300
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,040
I am not sure.

301
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:08,040
A soldier's battle

302
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:10,040
can't be decided by luck.

303
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,040
But

304
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,040
do you have a certain confidence

305
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,040
every time you go to the battlefield?

306
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,040
Actually, I have been thinking about it for a long time.

307
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:22,040
This is the only chance to solve the code of the Liyue Village.

308
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,040
If it works,

309
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,040
it can take the position of the battlefield of the north of the Subei.

310
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,040
If it fails,

311
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,040
if it fails,

312
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,040
it may be

313
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,040
the last time I call you.

314
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,040
I heard Yuan Zhong say

315
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,040
that you were injured.

316
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,040
Father,

317
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,040
it's just a small injury.

318
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,040
Are you feeling better?

319
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,040
Much better.

320
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,040
You should take the medicine on time.

321
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,040
You should take the medicine on time.

322
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,040
You will not get old.

323
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,040
Father,

324
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,040
I am not filial.

325
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,040
I have been back for a long time.

326
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,040
I didn't say I would go back to see you.

327
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,040
But since ancient times,

328
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,040
I have been unfilial.

329
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,040
Since I was a child, you have taught us

330
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,040
to be prudent.

331
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:27,040
So if I can do something now,

332
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:34,040
I can exchange the chance of the survival of thousands of people on the battlefield of the north of the Subei,

333
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,040
I believe you can understand me.

334
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:20,040
cause I decided to be a 많at now.

335
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,040
Yes.

336
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:26,040
After the optimized process,

337
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:32,340
you can start relying on

338
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:41,040
red-handed resorting on poor business.

339
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,040
Yes.

340
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,040
When you're done,

341
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,040
go home and have a look.

342
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,040
Okay.

343
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,040
By then, I believe

344
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:56,040
I'll be the only one who can go home.

345
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,040
Okay.

346
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,040
What did Gu Siling say?

347
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,040
What did Gu Siling say?

348
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,040
Chen,

349
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,040
let's listen to your plan.

350
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,040
As I said before,

351
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,040
the 153th Japanese Air Force

352
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,040
is one of the first to use the code of the Japanese Air Force.

353
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,040
Because we can't decipher their confidential information,

354
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:36,040
we don't know what their next attack time

355
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,040
and goal is.

356
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,040
You want Ding Yi to trick Wu Tian

357
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:43,040
but Ding Yi is not a Japanese Air Force.

358
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:46,040
He doesn't even know the basic algorithm of the code system.

359
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,040
He doesn't need to know it at all.

360
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,040
But I need...

361
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,040
Sir,

362
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,040
I need your cooperation.

363
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,040
How can I cooperate?

364
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:14,040
Tonight, I'll ask Ding Yi to persuade Wu Tian

365
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:17,040
to send a secret message to the Japanese Air Force

366
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,040
using the code of the Japanese code system.

367
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,040
The message is to send a message tonight.

368
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,040
In order to keep the information from being leaked,

369
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:26,040
Wu Tian will definitely send the 153th Air Force

370
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,040
that he can only coordinate.

371
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,040
The mission of the 153th Air Force

372
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,040
is to attack the northern part of the country.

373
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,040
The commander of the 153th Air Force

374
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,040
is the commander of the 153rd Air Force

375
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,040
in the northern part of the country.

376
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,040
So as long as the commander of the 153rd Air Force

377
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,040
sends the air alert,

378
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,040
the Japanese will no longer be safe

379
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:48,040
from the code of the Japanese code system.

380
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:15,040
It's already 9.30 a.m.

381
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:20,040
Even if I send an urgent report,

382
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:24,040
I still need to persuade the commander of the Russian military zone.

383
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,040
If this process doesn't work,

384
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,040
I'm afraid there will be...

385
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,040
Absolutely not.

386
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,040
Sir,

387
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,040
the content of this operation

388
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,040
cannot be leaked at all.

389
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,040
What did you say?

390
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,040
11 communication points in Shanghai Station

391
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,040
were cut off.

392
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,040
We don't even know

393
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,040
how the information was leaked.

394
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,040
So,

395
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,040
this operation

396
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:49,040
must be sealed off.

397
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,040
Nonsense.

398
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,040
Sir,

399
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,040
as far as I know,

400
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,040
the commander of the Russian military zone,

401
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,040
Li Mingyang,

402
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,040
is your old friend, right?

403
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:05,040
The 405th Battalion is his branch.

404
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,040
So as long as you are willing,

405
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:09,040
you don't need to report to Chongqing.

406
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:17,040
You little rascal.

407
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,040
You can't even calculate the number.

408
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,040
I'll give you the number.

409
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,040
Sir,

410
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,040
this is just a phone call for you.

411
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:30,040
But for the people of the northern part of the Sui,

412
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,040
it's a life or death situation.

413
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,040
Sir,

414
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:41,040
do you think he's messing around?

415
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,040
It's worth a try.

416
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,040
What?

417
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,040
It's worth a try.

418
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,040
Worth?

419
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:49,040
I also agree that the executor of this plan

420
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:51,040
cannot be out of our test.

421
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,040
Sir,

422
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,040
have you forgotten what you said before?

423
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,040
That's right.

424
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:59,040
I still think it's a joke.

425
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,040
But

426
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,040
this is a chance

427
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,040
to fight the debt.

428
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,040
This plan has been completed.

429
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,040
The credit is in the debt.

430
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,040
I, Luo Han, will do whatever I can.

431
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:12,040
I'll really support you, Gu Yanshan.

432
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,040
What do you want?

433
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:24,040
I was just testing your determination.

434
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,040
All right, no problem.

435
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:30,040
I'll go to the commander-in-chief of the Li family.

436
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,040
I'll go there myself.

437
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,040
Then,

438
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,040
I'll do my best to support the people.

439
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,040
Thank you, sir.

440
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,040
Go, go, go.

441
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:28,040
Is this your house?

442
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,040
Yes.

443
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,040
Help me hold it.

444
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,040
Yiyan.

445
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,040
Yiyan.

446
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,040
Yiyan,

447
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:10,040
are you back when the flowers bloom?

448
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:31,040
Go.

449
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,040
Commander-in-chief,

450
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,040
it's getting late.

451
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,040
Are you leaving?

452
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,040
It's still early.

453
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,040
I can't afford to be late.

454
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:07,040
Taizhou is a long way from here.

455
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:09,040
It takes a long time to drive the fastest.

456
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,040
Commander-in-chief,

457
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,040
I'm sorry.

458
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,040
I'm sorry.

459
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,040
I'm sorry.

460
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:33,040
Or you don't plan to go from the beginning to the end?

461
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,040
What are you doing?

462
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:56,040
You scared me when you knocked on the door.

463
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,040
It's time to get up.

464
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,040
I was waiting for you downstairs.

465
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,040
Okay, okay.

466
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,040
Give me five more minutes.

467
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,040
No rules.

468
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:13,040
I'm watching the play.

469
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,040
Brother,

470
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,040
are you back when the flowers bloom?

471
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,040
Master,

472
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:50,040
I've memorized all the contents of the book.

473
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:52,040
I'll take it as you went to check it.

474
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,040
Thank you, Uncle Wu.

475
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,040
Did you contact the base?

476
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,040
I just called him three or four times.

477
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,040
No one answered.

478
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:04,040
Maybe he's not back yet.

479
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,040
No one answered?

480
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:14,040
I'm satisfied with Commander Li.

481
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,040
For my sake,

482
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:19,040
the army really hung up on the air raid alert

483
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,040
and even retreated.

484
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,040
But the Japanese plane

485
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,040
didn't move at all.

486
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,040
If it's a crime,

487
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:31,040
is it my fault or his?

488
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,040
Since you don't want to go, why did you say yes?

489
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:42,040
He's just a young master

490
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,040
that the Gu family adores.

491
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,040
He's naive.

492
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,040
If I turn him down,

493
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,040
he'll be

494
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,040
a dead man.

495
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,040
He'll sue me for his father.

496
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,040
Why would I do that?

497
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,040
If he wants to act,

498
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,040
I can pay him.

499
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,040
If he wants to die,

500
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:12,040
I can't afford to pay him.

501
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,040
Come in.

502
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,040
Sir, the car is ready.

503
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,040
Okay, I'll go.

504
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:24,040
If he asks,

505
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:27,040
you can tell him I've been back.

506
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:29,040
The car is almost here.

507
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,040
I'll persuade Wu Tian

508
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,040
to use Li Yue's code

509
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:39,040
to send a message

510
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,040
to the Japanese air raid troops

511
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:42,040
to prepare for the air raid.

512
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,040
Mr. Ba,

513
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,040
you'll have the nearest four or five battalions

514
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,040
hang up the air raid alert

515
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,040
to confuse Wu Tian.

516
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,040
He'll think Li Yue's code

517
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,040
has been leaked.

518
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,040
If Wu Tian asks you

519
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,040
how Li Yue's code was leaked,

520
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,040
what would you say?

521
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,040
I'll say

522
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:03,040
Mr. William told me.

523
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,040
My efforts were wasted.

524
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:08,040
So I want to go back to England

525
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,040
as soon as possible.

526
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:13,040
Wait.

527
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,040
What if Wu Tian

528
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:18,040
goes to the Japanese air raid troops

529
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:20,040
to find William's team?

530
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,040
They'll all be left behind.

531
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,040
No.

532
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,040
William has resigned

533
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:26,040
because he's not feeling well.

534
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:28,040
He'll be back to England soon.

535
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,040
You'll attend his party

536
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,040
to say goodbye.

537
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,040
Callers

538
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,040
Hello?

539
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,040
Hello?

540
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,040
Are you back?

541
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,040
OK.

542
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,040
I see.

543
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,040
What happened?

544
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,040
Don't be nervous.

545
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,040
The car broke down on the road.

546
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,040
We didn't get in touch.

547
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,040
Didn't get in touch?

548
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,040
No.

549
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:33,040
How did he know the car broke down on the road?

550
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,040
Gu... Gu Yanshan.

551
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:38,040
We only have two hours left

552
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:40,040
before we meet in the drug store.

553
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:43,040
What if we can't get the air alert at eight o'clock?

554
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,040
What should we do?

555
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:46,040
You won't have to wait for me to get the air alert.

556
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,040
What should we do?

557
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,040
Are you going to cancel the operation?

558
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,040
Nonsense.

559
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:58,040
You and Gu Yanshan go to the hotel first.

560
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:00,040
I'll go to the station first.

561
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:03,040
Why are you going to the station?

562
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,040
It's not the time yet.

563
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,040
Why are you going to the station?

564
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,040
You haven't been there yet.

565
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:08,040
I've been drinking for five days.

566
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,040
Don't worry.

567
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:13,040
I have a way to hang up the air alert.

568
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,040
Okay?

569
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:15,040
What's your idea?

570
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,040
Tell me.

571
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,040
Gu Yanshan.

572
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:22,040
Are you going to act on the spot?

573
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,040
This is not your style.

574
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,040
I have a way.

575
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:28,040
You should tell me if you have a way.

576
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,040
Is it hard to do?

577
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:32,040
I'm the one who's going to die now.

578
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,040
Even your teacher ran away.

579
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:36,040
If you can't hang up the air alert,

580
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,040
you'll shoot me first in five days.

581
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,040
I tell you.

582
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:42,040
I'm not from the drug team.

583
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,040
I'm a military officer.

584
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,040
But I can't tell you too much because of the situation.

585
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,040
But please believe me.

586
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,040
I can handle this.

587
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:57,040
I don't believe it.

588
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:59,040
I knew you weren't that simple.

589
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:01,040
But Ding Ying, remember.

590
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:03,040
No matter what happens today,

591
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,040
you won't be in danger of life.

592
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,040
If we can change the password of the drug team in five days,

593
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,040
we'll be successful.

594
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,040
You won't have any problems.

595
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,040
If it doesn't work,

596
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,040
if it doesn't work,

597
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:16,040
if the 405 Battalion doesn't hang up the air alert,

598
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:18,040
it can only prove that you're wrong.

599
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,040
Right?

600
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:23,040
But five days need to continue to use the code of the drug team to pass the information.

601
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,040
So they won't touch you at all.

602
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,040
That's five days.

603
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:33,040
He's crazy.

604
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,040
Even his own people killed you.

605
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:35,040
You've seen it before.

606
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,040
Then I, Gu Yaoshan, also tell you.

607
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:40,040
No matter what happens,

608
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:42,040
I'll be in front of you.

609
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,040
I'll be waiting for you.

610
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:50,040
Okay, let's split up.

611
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:51,040
You go to the restaurant first.

612
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,040
I'll go to the station.

613
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:53,040
I promise you before eight o'clock.

614
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,040
I'll hang up the air alert.

615
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:57,040
Split up?

616
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:00,040
What if something happens?

617
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,040
You'll break my money.

618
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:03,040
I'll be there in time to get the problem out of my head.

619
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,040
Before that,

620
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:07,040
you just have to hold on for five days and eat with him.

621
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:09,040
But when I show up,

622
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,040
you'll get in touch with him again.

623
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,040
You're really crazy.

624
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,040
I'm really crazy.

625
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:33,040
But if there were more crazy people like me,

626
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:35,040
Qin Licheng would have been kicked out long ago.

627
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,040
I'm sorry.

628
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:53,040
Uncle Gu.

629
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:56,040
Can he do it?

630
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:00,040
He said he could.

631
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:05,040
Gu,

632
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:08,040
do you think your young master is a good person?

633
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:10,040
You believe he can do anything.

634
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:16,040
Do you want to meet my lady?

635
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,040
It's not appropriate.

636
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,040
I said, Gu,

637
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:25,040
you really have to change your habit.

638
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,040
Why don't you knock on anyone's door?

639
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:29,040
It's rude.

640
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:31,040
What if your lady

641
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:33,040
is taking a bath in the house?

642
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:39,040
This is...

643
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:41,040
Our lady.

644
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:41,040
When the sun rises,

645
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:45,040
the first light will dance for me.

646
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:48,040
The house is lost,

647
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:52,040
there is no direction or a way out.

648
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:55,040
The pain in the eyes,

649
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,040
the fake heart,

650
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:59,040
the real person can't say it clearly.

651
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:02,040
Where is the wind going?

652
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:04,040
Whose window is shaking?

653
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:06,040
The sound of the bell.

654
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:09,040
The heart is thinking,

655
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:13,040
maybe you or I am feeling sad.

656
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:16,040
He is watching,

657
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:20,040
the night is long,

658
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:23,040
the tears are flowing,

659
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:27,040
the wound is already broken.

660
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:30,040
He is watching,

661
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:34,040
the shadow is wandering,

662
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:37,040
the night is long,

663
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:42,040
the world is already shaking.

664
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:00,040
The house is lost,

665
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:03,040
there is no direction or a way out.

666
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:07,040
The pain in the eyes,

667
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:08,040
the fake heart,

668
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:11,040
the real person can't say it clearly.

669
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:14,040
Where is the wind going?

670
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:16,040
Whose window is shaking?

671
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:18,040
The sound of the bell.

672
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:21,040
The heart is thinking,

673
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:25,040
maybe you or I am feeling sad.

674
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:28,040
He is watching,

675
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:31,040
the night is long,
