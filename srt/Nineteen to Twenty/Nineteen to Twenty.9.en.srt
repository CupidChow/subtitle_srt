00:00:57,098 --> 00:00:58,933
I heard Jung-yun talking about you.

14
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:00,852
What? When?

15
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:03,146
He was like,

16
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,523
"I like Ji-woo."

17
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:10,195
Someone was like, "Hey, you keep staring at Ji-woo."

18
00:01:10,278 --> 00:01:12,655
And he said, "My eyes are drawn to her."

19
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:16,326
Oh, my God! Why doesn't he say those things to me?

20
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:21,289
When I ask him directly how he feels, he just goes quiet,

21
00:01:21,372 --> 00:01:23,291
and I'm like, "What the heck?!"

22
00:01:25,126 --> 00:01:27,128
Ugh, I really like him.

23
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:30,715
Jung-yun is so funny.

24
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:34,010
Doesn't he look adorable when he smiles?

25
00:01:34,093 --> 00:01:35,345
I mean…

26
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:38,306
He's very handsome to begin with.

27
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:44,020
But he's got this smile sometimes. It's so faint, it's adorable.

28
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:46,815
As if he's trying to hold it back.

29
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:49,734
Oh! This is driving me nuts! Why is he so cute?

30
00:01:50,318 --> 00:01:52,362
-[laughs] -Oh, wow!

31
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:54,114
Ji-woo's pouring her heart out.

32
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:57,408
-I didn't realize she liked him that much. -She really likes him.

33
00:01:57,492 --> 00:01:59,119
She fell head over heels for Jung-yun.

34
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:03,581
-Why is he so weird about it? -Look, she's blushing.

35
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:06,126
Why can't he tell me that he likes me?

36
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:09,337
It's not that I don't know, I just wanna hear him say it.

37
00:02:12,715 --> 00:02:14,259
You're so cute.

38
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:18,138
[Pyeong-seok] Ji-min, what about you?

39
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:20,849
-Yes, Ji-min, who do you like most? -Who is it?

40
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:22,308
-I… -Just be honest.

41
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:24,144
I'm not sure.

42
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:25,937
[Pyeong-seok] Hm…

43
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,522
Do you not wanna say?

44
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:30,150
If it's between two girls, you can tell us who.

45
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:32,986
-[Ji-min] Ye-rin and Ji-woo. -Ye-rin and Ji-woo?

46
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:34,696
I keep going back and forth.

47
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:38,700
So, Ji-min and Se-yeon like the same two girls.

48
00:02:38,783 --> 00:02:40,827
Yep. They like the same girls.

49
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:43,329
And Jung-yun also likes Ji-woo. So the three of them…

50
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:45,206
-That's right. -…are tangled up.

51
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:49,127
I like Ji-woo, but I'm starting to like Ye-rin, too.

52
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:53,756
Especially after our date. I can't decide between the two.

53
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:56,384
-How was it? -[Ji-min] It was great.

54
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:57,677
Oh, was it?

55
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,222
Did it feel like hanging out with a friend or more?

56
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:02,557
[Ji-min] More than a friend.

57
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:08,438
There was something between us, like a connection.

58
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:11,816
And I was honest with her. I said, "I like both you and Ji-woo."

59
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:21,284
-Was it like that for you? -Me? Like what?

60
00:03:22,076 --> 00:03:23,328
Did you talk that openly?

61
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:25,079
-With Hee-ji? -Yeah.

62
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:27,206
-Yeah, we talked. -[Jung-yun] About what?

63
00:03:28,082 --> 00:03:29,125
About who she likes.

64
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:31,961
And did she say you?

65
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,546
-She said… -What did she say?

66
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:36,424
"…There is no one but you." [chuckles]

67
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:39,010
So everyone's saying who they like.

68
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:42,180
Out loud.

69
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:44,432
-[all laughing] -Everyone's saying who they like.

70
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:46,100
Everyone but you. Just say it.

71
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:49,520
-[Se-woon] Poor Jung-yun. -It was handed to him on a silver platter.

72
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:53,524
I hope he finally realized, "Oh, I need to say it, too."

73
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:56,110
-Just say it. -[Ji-eun] He's so guarded.

74
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:59,072
-She really opened up just now. -How do you feel?

75
00:03:59,155 --> 00:04:00,615
[Ji-woo] I said how I felt.

76
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:02,575
What do you wanna know?

77
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:06,829
-You wanna go out with Pyeong-seok, right? -[Ye-rin] Yeah.

78
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:08,456
Yeah, it's obvious.

79
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:12,293
I want to… get to know him better.

80
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:15,964
How did it go with Ji-min?

81
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,926
We went out as friends, but by the end…

82
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:26,808
He said he was starting to think of me as more than just a friend.

83
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:29,435
That's nice.

84
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:31,646
[Hee-ji] He's good at expressing himself.

85
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:34,065
-Yes, he is. -[Ji-woo] I can't believe he said that.

86
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:37,944
He said he feels differently when it's just the two of us,

87
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:42,156
compared to when we we're in a group, which took him by surprise.

88
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,202
I mean, I used to see him as a friend.

89
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,997
-[Ji-woo] Used to? -Now he's more that that.

90
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:54,294
Maybe because it's hard to resist when a boy is so nice and attentive.

91
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:58,965
-But I have no idea what's gonna happen. -[Ji-woo] Nobody knows.

-Wanna take a picture? -Yeah. I've always wanted to.

-Same. I've never taken one. -[gasps]

122
00:06:28,012 --> 00:06:30,306
Look! They lit up the castle just for us.

130
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:58,084
-I kinda suck at it. -How can you suck at it?

131
00:06:58,167 --> 00:06:59,836
I'm just bad at taking pictures.

132
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,672
-I'll show you how. -I need direction.

133

-Ten seconds? Three? -Ten seconds.

134
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:07,552
-Yeah. Three is too short. -Nine…

135
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:10,638
-What should I do? -Okay, okay. Try to look cool.

-Stand right here. -Okay.

-Closer. -Eye contact?

-[chuckling] -[camera shutter clicks]

143
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:27,697
Aren't you supposed to make eye contact?

144
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:30,992
-I'm sorry. -Let's see.

-[Sang-won] We look cool. -So cool.

150
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:45,798
-I haven't been on a carousel in so long. -[Seo-hyeon] Same.

151
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,050
Like, five years. Maybe ten.

152
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:50,803
-[Seo-hyeon] Ten years? -I was ten years old.

153
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:53,556

-Wow! -[Su-hyun] Yes, it's magical.

159
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:10,615
This reminds me of Stairway to Heaven.

160
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:12,783
-The merry-go-round scene. -Yeah.

161
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:14,994

00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:43,147
Oh, you look great!

175
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:45,525
[chuckles] I look silly.

176
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,529
[both laughing]

177
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:55,243
This one's nice, look.

178
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:57,828
You look good, but I don't. Let's ignore that one.

179
00:08:58,454 --> 00:09:00,331
-How about this one? -It's a nice one.

180
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:01,457
-I like it. -Me, too.

181
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:04,126
[operator] Safety check complete. Ready for takeoff.

182
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,169
THE SPANISH PIRATE SHIP

183
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:08,506
-[Sang-won] There's no one else. -This is insane.

184
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:09,674
[Sang-won exclaims]

185
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,844
Don't panic. Don't panic.

186
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:16,180
-Put your arms up! -[squeals]

187
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:19,976
-Put your arms up. -Don't panic! Don't panic!

188
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:21,269
Wait, one more time?

189
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:23,187
Put your arms up!

190
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:25,648
[both exclaiming]

191
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:29,193
You can relax now.

192
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:32,113
They're the first ones to hold hands.

193
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:36,617
-They're basically dating. -[Kyuhyun] I don't know.

194
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:39,370
-[Ji-eun] Oh, they're dating. -[Su-hyun] What?

195
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:42,164
[Kyuhyun sighs]

196
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:43,833
He crossed his arms.

197
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:46,502
-[all laughing] -[Se-woon] He disagrees.

198
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:48,963
Want me to protect you?

199
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,466
-I'm so scared. -Shall I?

200
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:55,136
-Yes, please. -Okay. Watch out.

201
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:57,972
-Here we go! -[screaming]

202
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:08,316
-Compared to my last time-- -It's so scary!

203
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,442
You were scared?

204
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:13,988
[Seo-hyeon] Don't panic. Don't panic.

205
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:15,948
[Sang-won] This is awesome!

206
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:18,200
[exclaiming]

207
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:22,663
-[Seo-hyeon] What's happening? -Here we go!

208
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:23,998
[Seo-hyeon] Please, no!

209
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:26,167
-[screaming] -[exclaiming]

210
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:30,546
[screaming continues]

211
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:36,052
[both laughing]

212
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:38,304
Another one?

213
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:40,348
-[Seo-hyeon] I can't. -It's coming!

214
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:42,808
[Seo-hyeon yelling]

215
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:47,021
-[screaming] -[laughing]

216
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:51,150
-[Sang-won whooping] -[screaming]

217
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:56,072
[laughing]

218
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:00,743
That was so fun.

219
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:03,829
[operator, in Korean] Thank you for riding.

220
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:06,540
-[in English] Oh, wow. Wow. -Here.

221
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:08,376
Can you stand?

222
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:11,337
Oh, my legs are shaking.

223
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,838
[Sang-won] Be careful.

224
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:14,632
You're good?

225
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:17,510
-You okay? -[both chuckle]

226
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:21,847
[Sang-won] Should we sit down… for a little bit?

227
00:11:22,681 --> 00:11:25,518
-[Seo-hyeon] Yes, I'm starving. -This looks delicious.

228
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:28,020
-[Sang-won] Bon appétit. -Bon appétit.

229
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:39,115
-Do you like it? -[exclaims]

230
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:40,991
It's so good.

231
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:43,536
So good.

232
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:45,913
Did you have fun?

233
00:11:46,705 --> 00:11:48,624
-I had a great time. -You did?

234
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:53,337
I'm gonna dream about all of this.

235
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:55,923
Yeah. This is the stuff of dreams.

236
00:11:56,006 --> 00:11:57,633
When the castle lit up…

237
00:11:57,716 --> 00:11:59,427
-Right? -That was incredible.

238
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:01,345
[Seo-hyeon] I loved it.

239
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:03,681
[coughs]

240
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:04,640
[cough echoing]

241
00:12:04,723 --> 00:12:06,475
-[chuckles] -[Sang-won] What?

242
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:09,520
We're at Lotte World Adventure

243
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:12,565
-and we can hear our voices echo. -[laughs]

244
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:16,444
-I love having the place to ourselves. -Mmm.

245
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:20,614
-And being here with you. -Mmm.

246
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:23,993
-[chuckles] -What?

247
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:26,620
Why did you make a face?

248
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:28,289
-What? -You're like…

249
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:29,999
No, no. I just…

250
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:33,377
I had something on my cheek.

251
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:34,879
[chuckles]

252
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:36,630
It's a funny reaction, though.

253
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:40,301
SANG-WON

254
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:44,180
I was on a date in the magical place and with someone that I really like.

255
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:46,474
There was no one else there.

256
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:49,852
It was literally a dream date.

257
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:50,811
SEO-HYEON

258
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:55,065
Normally, you have to wait for hours to get on the French Revolution ride,

259
00:12:55,941 --> 00:13:00,237
but we just walked up to it and got on.

260
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:01,864
It was like a dream.

261
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:05,576
Lotte World Adventure all to ourselves,

262
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:08,579
that's a perfect dream date for me.

263
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:11,415
[Seo-hyeon] I had fun.

264
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:13,959
So who will you pick for your dream date?

265
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:15,461
[both chuckle]

266
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:17,087
Come on.

267
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:19,840
-Just kidding. Kidding. -My dream date…

268
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:23,010
[Sang-won] I don't mind.

269
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:26,138
This is so nice.

270
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:29,683
I wonder what the next dream date is.

271
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:32,770
It will be up there when we get back.

272
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:36,315
-Though nothing can beat this. -Yeah.

273
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:38,400
-It was the best. -I agree.

274
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:40,778
So fun.

275
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:42,863
[winces]

276
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:45,533
-[Ji-eun] Uh-oh. -I don't really see any spark.

277
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:48,536
I knew there was something fishy.

278
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:51,705
You guys were saying, "Oh, they're holding hands. So cute."

279
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:52,665
Right.

280
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:55,334
But if you really look at how it happened,

281
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:57,419
Seo-hyeon just went like this.

282
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:59,630
He's the one who put his hand on hers.

283
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:01,340
That's true.

284
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,300
He made the move.

285
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:06,804
And notice how he kept saying how much he loved being with her,

286
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:08,222
how happy that made him.

287
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:11,016
-But Seo-hyeon… -[Su-hyun] She was just enjoying the park.

288
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,935
-She just came along for the ride. -Exactly.

289
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:14,979
-Literally. -I think so.

290
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:17,523
-[Kyuhyun] You think so, too? -Yeah, it's obvious.

291
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:19,650
She must have felt uncomfortable.

292
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:22,778
Sang-won kept asking questions, if she was happy,

293
00:14:22,861 --> 00:14:25,906
if she liked being there, who she'll pick for her dream date.

294
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,366
It's funny how that works.

295
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:30,411
Some girls think the guys are being too coy.

296
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:32,788
-That's true. -And others think they're too direct.

297
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:35,374
-Right. -You must pick up on the subtle cues.

298
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:36,750
[Su-hyun] Wow.

299
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:38,252
They'll learn over time.

300
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:40,838
-They're still young. -[Ji-eun] It comes with experience.

301
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:44,592
[Ye-rin] Hey, guys! Hurry, it's almost midnight.

302
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:46,635
[Jung-yun] 11:59.

303
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:50,139
-And we need someone's agreement. -Yeah.

304
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:53,434
[Jung-yun] A girl has to agree first.

305
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:56,604
[indistinct chatter]

306
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:00,566
[chuckles]

307
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:03,861
-What? -Nothing.

308
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,656
Oh, look!

309
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,866
It's out.

310
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:12,870
[Ye-rin] Wait!

311
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:15,706

314
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:31,722
-Wow! -What?

315
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:33,307
-Omakase! -I want the omakase.

316
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:35,184
-That's the one I'd pick. -[Se-woon] Wow.

317
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:37,394
-Yes! Definitely that one! -[Ji-eun] Omakase!

318
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:38,729
[Se-woon] Or a movie theater.

319
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:41,774
Wait! Wait! If you go to see a movie at certain times…

320
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:43,859
-You're alone! -Early in the morning.

321
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:46,612
-You can have the theater for yourself. -[Kyuhyun] Totally!

322
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:48,614
-[Ji-eun] Omakase! -Omakase is more unique.

323
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:49,531
So yummy!

324
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:51,659
[Se-woon] Ye-rin wants to write her name.

325
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:54,828
[Ye-rin] Hey! Wait!

326
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,498
Hey! Wait!

327
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:00,000
Ugh, wait.

328
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:07,299
-Hm. -[Ji-min sighs]

329
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:12,304
That's not the one anyway.

330
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:15,432
[Jung-yun] Omakase?

331
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:20,604
FULL RENTAL OF A MOVIE THEATER JEONG SEO-YEONG

332
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:23,649
-Who is Seo-yeong going with? -[Jung-yun] Yeah.

333
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:25,192
Sang-won.

334
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:27,361
SEO-YEONG

335
00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:29,613
I've been wanting to hang out with Sang-won.

336
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:33,033
So, this afternoon, I decided to ask him out.

337
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:35,911
EARLIER TODAY

338
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,663
-So… -Yeah?

339
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:40,582
I want to go on my dream date with you.

340
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:43,210
-I'd like that. Yeah, I'd like that. -Really?

341
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:46,171
-As long as we don't eat any raw fish. -[laughs]

342
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:49,466
-Really? -Yeah, it doesn't agree with me.

343
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:52,761
-Sang-won's in demand. -Busy man.

344
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:54,596
He's running all over.

345
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,683
-Out tonight, out tomorrow. -[Ye-rin] Lotte World, movie theater…

346
00:16:57,766 --> 00:16:59,810
[Se-yeon] He gets to do all the fun stuff.

347
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:04,815
Yeah, but I'm so full right now. I can't imagine eating omakase.

348
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:06,775
Come on, Jung-yun.

349
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,902
Where are you priorities?

350
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:11,739
-[Jung-yun] I'm so full. -[Ye-rin] But, omakase.

351
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:13,449
And with Hanwoo beef.

352
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:15,325
[Jung-yun] I can't think of food right now.

353
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:18,245
[Hee-ji] I bet they'll serve beef sashimi and beef tartare.

354
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:23,125
-It's a bit of a letdown, right? -[Ye-rin] Who wants it?

355
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:25,627
Total let down.

356
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,465
Someone might lose their date.

357
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:36,638
PYEONG-SEOK

358
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,390
I considered the omakase dinner.

359
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:44,146
But when I heard what Hee-ji said, when she called it a letdown,

360
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:46,356
I wasn't gonna write my name up there.

361
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:49,443
If it wasn't for her reaction,

362
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:51,403
I would have probably done it.

363
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:53,363
YE-RIN

364
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:56,658
I was waiting for something that would feel like a perfect date.

365
00:17:57,826 --> 00:18:01,997
Omakase is not what I had in mind, so I had no problem passing on it.

366
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:05,209
-She's never ever tried it. -None of them have.

367
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:07,002
One day they'll regret it.

368
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:11,381
I don't think they wanna go on a date that's all about food.

369
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:13,383
To them it's not as exciting as Lotte World.

370
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:14,343
[Ji-eun] Right.

371
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,722
[Hee-ji] Why do you look so exhausted?

372
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:21,934
-I'm still adjusting -You're crying right now, right?

373
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:25,062
-You just shed a tear. -[all laughing]

374
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:30,484
Ji-min's crying on the outside and I'm crying on the inside.

375
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:31,860
-That's mine. -Oh, sorry.

376
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:34,279
-[Se-yeon] You can drink it. -[Ji-woo] Oh, okay.

377
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:39,326
-I want some coffeene. -"Coffin?"

378
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:41,620
-I heard "coffin," too. -[Ji-woo] "Coffin?"

379
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:43,747
[Ye-rin] Here, just take off the lid and drink.

380
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:47,501
-Would you like one? -No, no. Sorry.

381
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:49,461
No, no. You can drink mine.

382
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:53,924
-Caffeine? We can share it. -No, it's yours.

383
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:56,343
-Why don't we go and talk? -[Jung-yun] It's caffeine.

384
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:57,845
[Hee-ji] It's getting late.

385
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:02,766
[Se-yeon] Let's talk here.

386
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,231
[Se-yeon] Actually, this place isn't great.

387
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:11,733
-Wanna go the the Truth Room? -Where is it?

388
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:14,570
-[Se-yeon] Downstairs. -All right. Let's go.

389
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:18,198
-[sighs] I'm tired. -[Seo-yeong] Go to bed then.

390
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:21,160
I can't sleep right now.

391
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:22,828
Let me hold this for you.

392
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:32,337
I was trying not to think about it, but I couldn't help myself.

393
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:33,255
JUNG-YUN

394
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:37,176
I knew that if I didn't tell her how I felt,

395
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,304
I risk losing her to someone else who will.

396
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:45,809
Where do you wanna go?

397
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:48,729
-What do you wanna do? -[Ji-woo] Eat some nice food.

398
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:53,108
Let's do some research and find some nice food.

399
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:56,445
Mmm. Sounds good.

400
00:19:57,654 --> 00:19:59,072
So, how was your date today?

401
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:02,993
The sushi was delicious, but to be honest,

402
00:20:03,076 --> 00:20:05,162
I wanted to know how Jung-yun felt.

403
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:07,748
I mean, he knows I feel.

404
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:11,460
And he saw me talk to Ji-min a while back

405
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:13,253
and so I guess…

406
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:16,882
I wanted him to feel a bit jealous,

407
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:20,052
but it didn't work.

408
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:21,845
He still hasn't said it.

409
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:26,808
If someone likes me, I expect them to tell me.

410
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:29,478
But nobody's doing that right now.

411
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:32,689
They say that they're interested in me,

412
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:36,735
but I don't really see it in their actions.

413
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:38,862
So I'm a little confused.

414
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:44,993
Right now, who's the guy who you like the most?

415
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:48,038
-It's Jung-yun, of course. -Right.

416
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:50,916
I'm still interested in you and Ji-min,

417
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:54,878
but Jung-yun's the only one I have feelings for.

418
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:58,340
I mean, you and I haven't really hung out.

419
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:02,511
-Fact. -[chuckles]

420
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:05,639
This is the Truth Room, so I'm telling the truth.

421
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:07,557
[Se-yeon] Yeah.

422
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:10,185
When you said you liked me, I was wondering,

423
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:11,311
"Did he just say it

424
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:13,272
-because he was drunk?" -Right.

425
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:15,524
[Ji-woo] And I still don't know the answer.

426
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:17,776
[Se-yeon sighs]

427
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:21,154
Are you interested in me?

428
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:23,282
Do you actually like me?

429
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:28,704
When I said that yesterday,

430
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:31,957
-it wasn't because I was drunk. -Mmm.

431
00:21:32,874 --> 00:21:34,209
I was telling you

432
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:36,837
how I really felt deep in my heart.

433
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:40,090
I told you yesterday, too,

434
00:21:40,173 --> 00:21:42,134
but I think you're so cool.

435
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:46,054
If I were you, I would have given up, but you didn't.

436
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:48,307
And that's very attractive.

437
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:52,352
Right, but…

438
00:21:56,523 --> 00:21:58,525
I didn't think it'd be so emotionally taxing.

439
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:00,610
[sighs]

440
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:04,740
Stop worrying so much.

441
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:07,492
Go on dates with different girls.

442
00:22:09,911 --> 00:22:11,163
Enjoy yourself.

443
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:15,542
-So, you're telling me to just have fun? -Yeah.

444
00:22:16,918 --> 00:22:18,420
I was gonna do that anyway.

445
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:20,213
Then why the emotional struggle?

446
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:22,007
-You said-- -I'm not struggling.

447
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:23,925
-I'm not struggling. -I don't get it.

448
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:26,178
You and Pyeong-seok were out on the terrace.

449
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:28,930
You chatted out there for the longest time.

450
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:31,099
Can in hand, like in a beer commercial.

451
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:34,019
You came back without a word, showered, worked out,

452
00:22:34,102 --> 00:22:36,605
ate, and then went to talk with Pyeong-Seok again.

453
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:39,232
-What are you doing? -Ouch, that stings.

454
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:40,650
Why are you even here?

455
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:45,238
If there's a reason you're struggling, then you should address it.

456
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:48,158
If not, just try to have fun, for Pete's sake.

457
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:50,702
But I've been observing you.

458
00:22:51,411 --> 00:22:52,871
-[groans] -I've never seen you smile

459
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:54,998
except for when we were holding hands.

460
00:22:56,124 --> 00:22:57,042
Just kidding.

461
00:22:57,959 --> 00:22:59,795
[all laugh]

462
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:05,467
-Ji-Woo was born for this. -[Ji-eun] She's a firecracker.

463
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:06,468
Just kidding.

464
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:10,013
-Talk to the back of my head. -[giggles]

465
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:10,931
Please, no.

466
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:13,225
Let's not do that.

467
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:14,142
[sighs]

468
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:19,314
[Se-yeon] I'm curious. How did you feel when we held hands again?

469
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:22,275
My heart skipped a beat.

470
00:23:25,403 --> 00:23:30,075
Remember during dance class, when we wouldn't let go of one another?

471
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:34,329
I felt something then.

472
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:40,544
But I kind of repressed that feeling. I thought I'd better forget it,

473
00:23:40,627 --> 00:23:42,796
because I didn't think we had much in common.

474
00:23:42,879 --> 00:23:43,713
Mmm.

475
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:47,884
It's not like you seemed particularly interested.

476
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:53,974
I just told myself that it was probably nothing.

477
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:04,359
Since we're telling the truth,

478
00:24:05,735 --> 00:24:08,697
when I saw the other four girls on day one…

479
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:13,410
-None of them were really my type. -Mm.

480
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:16,788
But then this transfer student showed up.

481
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:21,960
This tiny girl entered the classroom wearing a backpack bigger than her.

482
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:24,379
[students cheering, applauding]

483
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:28,049
I sat there staring, and I thought to myself…

484
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:30,093
"Oh."

485
00:24:31,052 --> 00:24:32,179
"She's the one."

486
00:24:32,262 --> 00:24:34,181
-Really? -That's how I felt.

487
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:36,808
[Ji-woo] Hm.

488
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:39,644
You were staring at me the whole time.

489
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:42,564
-[Se-yeon] Yeah. -Every time I looked at you.

490
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:43,857
DURING THE BEAUTY CLASS

491
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,650
Just write what you can see.

492
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:47,402
If you can only see one, write that.

493
00:24:47,485 --> 00:24:50,614
MIRROR

494
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:04,502
Ooh.

495
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:07,756
He just winked in the mirror.

496
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:12,177
-[Ji-woo] I saw you wink. -Somehow,

497
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:14,804
you looked even prettier in the mirror.

498
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:15,805
Really?

499
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:22,145
-This is kind of perfect. -[Se-yeon] Are you hot?

500
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:23,897
-[Ji-woo] No, it's perfect. -Sure?

501
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:25,899
-Everything's perfect. -[Se-yeon] Great.

502
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:28,860
I'll take some logs out of the fire, though.

503
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:31,404
-[chuckles] Sure, do that. -Take some out.

504
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:35,784
Honestly, I thought you'd wink back.

505
00:25:36,576 --> 00:25:37,661
I'm a good winker.

506
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:40,664
Right?

507
00:25:40,747 --> 00:25:42,791
-[Se-woon] What? -[Kyuhyun] What?

508
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:44,167
Did she just wink?

509
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:45,877
[Ji-eun] Oh, yeah, she did.

510
00:25:46,544 --> 00:25:47,671
I'm a good winker.

511
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:50,757
Right?

512
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:54,094
-[chuckles] -[Ji-woo] I'm good, right?

513
00:25:54,177 --> 00:25:55,804
You're better than me.

514
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:59,391
Some people's faces scrunch up when they wink, but not mine.

515
00:25:59,474 --> 00:26:01,601
I can wink without moving my face.

516
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:04,145
My face stays the same.

517
00:26:06,606 --> 00:26:07,440
[sighs]

518
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:09,484
It's hot.

519
00:26:09,567 --> 00:26:10,777
It's cold!

520
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,821
-Is it? -Go get some air.

521
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:15,573
-Wow. -Just go outside.

522
00:26:21,037 --> 00:26:22,747
I'm having a hard time focusing.

523
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:24,291
I think you're a little drunk.

524
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:27,335
-Are you drunk? -I'm getting drunk on you.

525
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:34,801
JI-WOO

526
00:26:34,884 --> 00:26:37,721
I had hoped Jung-yun would tell me how he felt about me,

527
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:41,057
and I gave him plenty of opportunities to do it.

528
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:43,310
But he never did.

529
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:47,522
Meanwhile, Se-yeon asked if we could talk,

530
00:26:47,605 --> 00:26:49,232
he took the initiative.

531
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:52,110
And he said things I wanted to hear.

532
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:55,322
And I really liked that.

533
00:26:56,948 --> 00:26:59,534
I didn't think about Jung-yun the entire time.

534
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:01,619
SE-YEON

535
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:03,538
During our second conversation,

536
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:06,207
I feel like

537
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:09,419
we finally got to express our mutual attraction for each other.

538
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:13,173
[Se-yeon] Aren't you tired?

539
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:17,260
-I feel like it's 8:00 a.m. -[Se-yeon] Really?

540
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:20,847
Well, then we can stay here another 12 hours, right?

541
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:23,141
-Or 16? -[Ji-woo chuckles] Twenty-four.

542
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:25,977
[all laughing]

543
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:28,897
So, Miss Ji-woo is very direct.

544
00:27:29,939 --> 00:27:31,733
-"Miss Ji-woo"? -Sorry.

545
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:34,736
-Why the "miss"? -I guess she seems more mature than me.

546
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:36,863
[laughs] She probably is.

547
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:38,907
Ji-woo's so direct.

548
00:27:39,949 --> 00:27:43,078
It's like she's holding Se-yeon's heart and pumping it.

549
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:44,412
[all laugh]

550
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:47,374
[Se-woon] That sounds accurate.

551
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:49,125
[Kyuhyun exclaims]

552
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:52,629
Anyway, Se-yeon opened up to her.

553
00:27:52,712 --> 00:27:54,422
He told her how he felt.

554
00:27:55,131 --> 00:27:58,259
-So now, Jung-yun should be worried. -[Su-hyun] True.

555
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:00,804
She wants Jung-yun to tell her how he feels,

556
00:28:00,887 --> 00:28:02,514
but Se-yeon beat him to it.

557
00:28:02,597 --> 00:28:05,100
-[Kyuhyun] Right. -She's attracted to Se-yeon.

558
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:07,060
But she still likes Jung-yun more.

559
00:28:07,143 --> 00:28:08,269
[Kyuhyun] Yeah.

560
00:28:10,271 --> 00:28:12,732
-I'll skip my morning workout. -Sit here.

561
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:15,902
I'm exhausted. These hills are steep.

562
00:28:16,444 --> 00:28:18,321
-[Hee-ji sighs] -What? What is it?

563
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:20,448
-How do you feel? -How do I feel?

564
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:23,201
Right now, I like Ji-woo.

565
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:26,621
But… Ugh.

566
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:29,958
I'm so confused. I don't know anymore.

567
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:32,627
Why? There must be a reason.

568
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:34,963
I really don't know what to do.

569
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:37,048
-[Hee-ji] Hm. -Do you know that feeling?

570
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:41,594
You need to express your emotions. Be honest.

571
00:28:42,345 --> 00:28:43,805
It's too hard.

572
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:45,557
-You have to. -I do?

573
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,975
-Yes -Really?

574
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:50,895
-Really? -So far, Ji-woo,

575
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:52,897
from what I can tell,

576
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:55,525
Ji-woo is the one who likes you the most.

577
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:58,027
Yeah, I got that.

578
00:28:58,111 --> 00:29:00,488
So if you don't want another guy to steal her,

579
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:02,532
you'll need to make a move.

580
00:29:02,615 --> 00:29:05,577
If you keep this up, who knows what will happen.

581
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:07,787
Nothing good.

582
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:09,205
[both chuckle]

583
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:12,542
If you have something you wanna say, say it.

584
00:29:13,501 --> 00:29:15,754
Tell her how you feel about her.

585
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:16,963
Tell her.

586
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:20,800
I'm frustrated with you.

587
00:29:21,968 --> 00:29:24,554
-I'm frustrated with myself. -Then act.

588
00:29:24,637 --> 00:29:27,766
Please. Please, please.

589
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:29,142
I'm frustrated, too.

590
00:29:30,977 --> 00:29:32,937
Hee-ji, thank you.

591
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:35,315
Jung-yun's so hard to read.

592
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:38,485
-He needs to say how he feels. -He's never tried before.

593
00:29:38,568 --> 00:29:40,320
-He has to try, though. -Try.

594
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:44,949
-[Hee-ji] Wow, the stars are so nice. -[Pyeong-seok] Sparkle, sparkle.

595
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:47,494
[Hee-ji] According to the others,

596
00:29:47,994 --> 00:29:50,580
whenever I talk about you, I start smiling.

597
00:29:50,663 --> 00:29:52,707
I get a big grin on my face.

598
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:53,958
Yeah.

599
00:29:55,376 --> 00:29:56,586
You make me smile.

600
00:29:57,545 --> 00:29:59,255
-[laughs] -[Pyeong-seok] Wow.

601
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:04,344
-So cute! -[Su-hyun] So cute!

602
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:06,763
Those two are adorable.

603
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:08,848
I love watching them.

604
00:30:09,849 --> 00:30:11,851
-[laughs] -[Pyeong-seok] Wow.

605
00:30:13,436 --> 00:30:15,897
-I guess you can't hide it. -[Hee-ji] My dimples.

606
00:30:17,857 --> 00:30:19,526
[Pyeong-seok] They don't lie.

607
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:23,238
[Hee-ji clears throat]

608
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,740
[Hee-ji] What's on your mind?

609
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:28,785
Ye-rin.

610
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:32,872
-She asked me out. -[Hee-ji] On a date?

611
00:30:34,123 --> 00:30:35,667
[Pyeong-seok] Out of nowhere.

612
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:39,337
She said she was interested.

613
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,382
I didn't say anything.

614
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:45,468
I don't know where she's going with this.

615
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:46,427
[Hee-ji winces]

616
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:50,014
Darn it. No one else is allowed to know how cute you are.

617
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:53,601
[Pyeong-seok] I mean, going out together is one thing.

618
00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:56,855
But she asked me out on a dream date.

619
00:30:57,814 --> 00:30:59,524
[Hee-ji sighs] She…

620
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:02,986
She asked you out on a dream date?

621
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:05,321
[Pyeong-seok] I thought you two talked.

622
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:07,782
We did, earlier today.

623
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:12,120
-Her asking you on a dream date-- -[Pyeong-seok] Right.

624
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:14,247
-It's… -[Pyeong-seok sighs]

625
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:16,165
I mean, it's a bit…

626
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:18,459
[huffs]

627
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:22,046
[both laughing]

628
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:24,424
[Hee-ji groans]

629
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:26,718
I didn't see that one coming.

630
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:28,678
[Pyeong-seok] Me neither.

631
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,933
[both chuckling]

632
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:35,935
[Hee-ji sighs]

633
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:38,563
[Hee-ji] Have fun, I guess.

634
00:31:41,941 --> 00:31:44,986
Pyeong-seok is going on a date with Ye-rin tomorrow. So then…

635
00:31:46,112 --> 00:31:47,822
I'm not too worried about Pyeong-seok

636
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:49,115
-and Hee-ji. -[Ji-eun] No?

637
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:51,159
But you never know.

638
00:31:51,951 --> 00:31:54,162
[Ji-eun] Right. Ye-rin's very attractive.

639
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:56,748
Look at Ye-rin and Ji-min. Anything can happen.

640
00:31:57,665 --> 00:31:59,584
What if Ye-rin ties her hair up again?

641
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:00,501
[laughs]

642
00:32:02,211 --> 00:32:03,713
Oh, the hair in a bun.

643
00:32:03,796 --> 00:32:06,132
But wasn't Ye-rin more attracted to Ji-min?

644
00:32:06,215 --> 00:32:08,718
-I'm not sure anymore. -You never know.

645
00:32:08,801 --> 00:32:11,471
-[Ji-eun] Right. -Especially if she ties her hair up.

646
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:15,475
DAY THREE AS 20-YEAR-OLDS

647
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:29,197
[yawns]

648
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:14,701
[Seo-hyeon] Seo-yeong, what happened yesterday?

649
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:16,202
Why did you write your name?

650
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:18,204
[Seo-yeong] For the movie theater?

651
00:33:18,287 --> 00:33:22,250
[Seo-hyeon] Did you do it super-fast or was everyone else a little slow?

652
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:25,586
[Seo-yeong] I was sitting up front, so I just jumped up.

653
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:27,505
Wow.

654
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:36,597
-[Seo-hyeon] I want the orange mango. -[Seo-yeong] It's probably gone.

655
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:38,766
-Where's my orange mango? -Where is it?

656
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:41,728
-You've gotta be kidding. -Capri Sun?

657
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:43,187
[Seo-yeong] Saw someone drink it.

658
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:44,230
-Who? -[Ji-woo] Not me.

659
00:33:44,814 --> 00:33:47,025
-Who? -Jung-yun, I think.

660
00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:48,818
-Who? -Jung-yun.

661
00:33:48,901 --> 00:33:49,944
Jung-yun?

662
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,864
I have no patience today.

663
00:33:54,949 --> 00:33:56,743
I'll show him who's the boss.

664
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:58,995
[Sang-won laughs]

665
00:33:59,078 --> 00:34:00,204
Poor Jung-yun.

666
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:03,166
Jung-yun, what are you drinking?

667
00:34:03,249 --> 00:34:06,252
-Capri Sun. Is it yours? -Yeah. She was about to have it.

668
00:34:06,836 --> 00:34:09,255
-[Jung-yun] It's yours? -Have you lost your mind?

669
00:34:09,338 --> 00:34:10,381
Is it yours?

670
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:11,632
Enjoying it?

671
00:34:12,091 --> 00:34:13,176
[laughs]

672
00:34:13,968 --> 00:34:14,802
Yes.

673
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:21,059
-That's great. -Delicious.

674
00:34:21,976 --> 00:34:24,937
[Seo-hyeon] I'm glad. As long as you're enjoying it.

675
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:27,940
[chuckles] Look at those two.

676
00:34:28,775 --> 00:34:29,984
Frick and Frack.

677
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:31,277
Besties.

678
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:36,657
-[Seo-hyeon] Mozzarella. -[Ye-rin] Mozzarella?

679
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:42,663
-Oh, Seo-hyeon. -[Ji-woo] Seo-yeong.

680
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:44,540
[Hee-ji] Whoa.

681
00:34:46,292 --> 00:34:48,711
Not tonight. You're not going out.

682
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:51,631
-[Seo-yeong] Should I stay with you? -[Seo-hyeon] Why the dress?

683
00:34:51,714 --> 00:34:54,634
[Hee-ji] You look great. I'd totally fall in love with you.

684
00:34:54,717 --> 00:34:56,761
[Seo-yeong] Why aren't you wearing blue?

685
00:34:56,844 --> 00:34:58,638
-This is it. -[Seo-yeong] Really?

686
00:34:58,721 --> 00:34:59,555
My outfit.

687
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:04,393
Seo-yeong, you look so chic.

688
00:35:05,686 --> 00:35:06,604
Seriously.

689
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:08,981
SANG-WON

690
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:11,275
I don't know if Seo-hyeon was kidding or not,

691
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:14,445
but she went, "Seo-yeong, you look so chic."

692
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:17,198
That got me worried.

693
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:21,828
I started wondering if Seo-hyeon was actually okay with me going out.

694
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:26,541
I didn't know how she felt, so I had to talk to her.

695
00:35:29,585 --> 00:35:32,255
[Sang-won] Seo-hyeon, hold on. Truth Room?

696
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:34,173
[Seo-hyeon] Why? Am I in trouble?

697
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:36,759
[gasps] I've never been here before.

698
00:35:38,052 --> 00:35:39,512
-[chuckles] -[Seo-hyeon] What?

699
00:35:39,595 --> 00:35:41,055
It's just funny.

700
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:43,141
How do you feel?

701
00:35:43,891 --> 00:35:45,017
I feel…

702
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:48,396
-Well… -[Sang-won] Well…

703
00:35:49,063 --> 00:35:52,233
I guess for the first time, I feel

704
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:55,194
-conflicted. -Conflicted?

705
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:56,654
But you can go.

706
00:35:58,573 --> 00:35:59,740
Have fun.

707
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:02,451
I didn't wear blue on purpose, by the way.

708
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:05,121
Oh, that's why you were talking about clothes.

709
00:36:05,204 --> 00:36:08,082
I have a blue sweater, but I didn't want us to match.

710
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:10,376
Really?

711
00:36:13,087 --> 00:36:15,423
Seo-yeong is very pretty.

712
00:36:17,216 --> 00:36:18,301
You're prettier.

713
00:36:18,384 --> 00:36:19,385
[sighs]

714
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:22,972
[Sang-won] What?

715
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:25,433
[chuckles]

716
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:29,395
I'm not used to hearing these kinds of things.

717
00:36:29,478 --> 00:36:32,106
-[Sang-won] Like what? Nice things? -That's right.

718
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:34,358
-[Sang-won] Why? -I'm not used to it.

719
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:36,819
Haven't I already told you a lot of nice things?

720
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:41,115
But I've never met anyone like you before.

721
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:42,283
Am I too direct?

722
00:36:43,117 --> 00:36:45,203
-Definitely. -Are you uncomfortable?

723
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:48,289
Not uncomfortable, no. It's just…

724
00:36:49,165 --> 00:36:50,333
different.

725
00:36:50,416 --> 00:36:52,001
Well, then I'll keep doing it.

726
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:57,465
Fine, but at least give me some breaks in between.

727
00:36:58,090 --> 00:37:00,051
-To digest? -[Seo-hyeon] Yes.

728
00:37:00,134 --> 00:37:01,802
I need time to digest.

729
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:03,179
[Sang-won] You need time.

730
00:37:03,846 --> 00:37:07,767
Totally. I can't hear too many nice things at one time.

731
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:12,104
Sang-won was pretty reserved at school,

732
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:14,232
but now that we're all in the house,

733
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:17,109
he's been expressing his feelings a lot more.

734
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:20,446
And honestly, I'm grateful. I like it a lot.

735
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:24,283
But I'm also struggling with it,

736
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:27,995
'cause I don't know how to react

737
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:30,456
when he says those really nice things to me.

738
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:33,626
What am I supposed to do with that?

739
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:35,544
Wow.

740
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:38,798
She doesn't know how to react.

741
00:37:38,881 --> 00:37:41,217
-Makes her feel uncomfortable. -[Su-hyun] Yeah.

742
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,927
They're at different speeds.

743
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:46,013
Sang-won is running at 100.

744
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:47,848
-But Seo-hyeon is… -Not there.

745
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:49,809
…at like 50 something.

746
00:37:49,892 --> 00:37:52,937
She tries to catch up to him, but when it gets too intense

747
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:54,438
she slows down.

748
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:57,733
Plus Seo-hyeon is interested in some of the other guys.

749
00:37:57,817 --> 00:37:59,652
-That's true. -[Kyuhyun] Yeah.

750
00:37:59,735 --> 00:38:02,280
But when those guys see them together, they think,

751
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:04,949
"Oh, Sang-won and Seo-hyeon are a couple."

752
00:38:05,032 --> 00:38:07,285
That's why none of the guys have made a move.

753
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:08,244
[Ji-eun] Very true.

754
00:38:08,327 --> 00:38:11,247
Maybe that's why Seo-hyeon feels uncomfortable

755
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:14,375
-with Sang-won's display of affection. -I can see that.

756
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:17,128
Well, then she should just ask him directly,

757
00:38:17,211 --> 00:38:18,587
"Stop doing this."

758
00:38:18,671 --> 00:38:20,548
And she should ask another guy out.

759
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:25,428
-But I don't think she will. -Seo-hyeon's not that kind of person.

760
00:38:25,511 --> 00:38:27,179
-Think so? -[Se-woon] It's pretty hard.

761
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:28,097
[Su-hyun] It is.

762
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:30,016
Things are going great with Sang-won.

763
00:38:30,099 --> 00:38:33,144
She might ruin the relationship if she asks someone else out.

764
00:38:33,227 --> 00:38:34,186
Right.

765
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:35,396
It is hard.

766
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:42,236
I'll do the dishes.

767
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:48,784
Finish up.

768
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:06,719
-I'll rinse. -I'm fine. There's not a lot.

769
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:10,264
-All right. -[Hee-ji] All right.

770
00:39:21,317 --> 00:39:22,401
Careful.

771
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:25,988
I might die of boredom.

772
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:28,366
[Pyeong-seok] Hm.

773
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:35,623
Okay.

774
00:39:39,835 --> 00:39:42,171
Welcome back. Next, we'll do our lips.

775
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:44,006
My lips, ladies.

776
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:47,593
[indistinct chatter]

777
00:40:08,197 --> 00:40:10,616
-[Ye-rin] Hey, Pyeong-seok. -[Pyeong-seok] Yeah?

778
00:40:10,699 --> 00:40:12,743
-How does it look? -I like it.

779
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:14,412
-[Ye-rin] Yes or no? -Go for it.

780
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:17,623
-[Ye-rin] Should I wear it? -[Pyeong-seok] Yes.

781
00:40:17,706 --> 00:40:19,250
[Ye-rin] Okay.

782
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:21,043
-Headband or not? -[Ji-woo] Headband.

783
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:23,045
-You think so? -[Ji-woo] It looks great.

784
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:25,131
-Let's go? -[Ye-rin] Okay.

785
00:40:26,298 --> 00:40:27,591
[Pyeong-seok] We're off.

786
00:40:29,176 --> 00:40:30,010
Have fun.

787
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:33,722
[Ye-rin] I feel great. See you later, alligator.

788
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:35,433
[Pyeong-seok] You won't be cold?

789
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:38,602
[Ye-rin] A jacket would be a pain.

790
00:40:39,228 --> 00:40:41,147
-Ji-min's mad. -[Kyuhyun] He's mad.

791
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:42,898
-He's jealous. -That's cute.

792
00:40:42,982 --> 00:40:44,733
-[Ji-eun] He's jealous easily. -Wow.

793
00:40:44,817 --> 00:40:48,028
Ji-min's feelings toward Ye-rin have grown a lot in just one day.

794
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:48,946
Amazing.

795
00:40:49,029 --> 00:40:50,197
YE-RIN &amp; PYEONG-SEOK'S DATE

796
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:52,533
-[Pyeong-seok] Is it far? -[Ye-rin] The manga cafe?

797
00:40:54,326 --> 00:40:56,454
-When's the last time you went to one? -Me?

798
00:40:57,872 --> 00:40:59,874
-Ninth grade. -Same!

799
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:02,042
-Oh, really? -That was my last time, too.

800
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:04,044
-Who did you go with? -I went with friends.

801
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:05,337
What about you?

802
00:41:05,921 --> 00:41:07,548
With friends.

803
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:09,341
-Your girlfriend? -Just friends.

804
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:11,343
-Really? -Really.

805
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:15,389
I wonder what Se-yeon's doing.

806
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:18,100
-He went to work out. -He's got a date today.

807
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:19,727
Right.

808
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:24,273
-He's got a dinner date with Hee-ji. -And I'm out with you.

809
00:41:25,024 --> 00:41:25,900
[chuckles softly]

810
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:33,365
Yeah, they've been having a lot of private chats, those two.

811
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:34,366
Who?

812
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:36,869
-Se-yeon and Ji-woo. -Right.

813
00:41:39,288 --> 00:41:40,956
They talked a lot yesterday.

814
00:41:42,082 --> 00:41:42,917
[Ye-rin] Hmm.

815
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:45,961
I wonder what they talked about.

816
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:47,129
[chuckles softly]

817
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:51,842
The more secretive they are, the more curious I get.

818
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:58,265
And same when you talk with Hee-ji. Why am I like that?

819
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:01,018
-I'm usually not that nosy. -[chuckles] Really?

820
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:09,527
My accent's pretty thick.

821
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:11,695
-Yeah. -It sounds a little harsh, right?

822
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:14,782
Well, a bit, but I like it.

823
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:15,699
Really?

824
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:17,326
Do the Seoul accent.

825
00:42:17,409 --> 00:42:18,702
The Seoul accent?

826
00:42:19,495 --> 00:42:20,871
-Yeah. -I'm bad at it.

827
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:21,997
Repeat after me.

828
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:24,583
"Where are we going today?"

829
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:27,127
Yeah, the Seoul accent sounds less harsh.

830
00:42:28,504 --> 00:42:31,382
"Where are we going today?" [chuckles]

831
00:42:32,591 --> 00:42:35,261
-We're going to a manga cafe. -A manga cafe.

832
00:42:35,344 --> 00:42:37,304
[in Seoul accent] "A manga cafe."

833
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:39,014
[in normal voice] I can't say it right.

834
00:42:39,098 --> 00:42:41,183
"We're going to a manga cafe."

835
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:44,770
[in Seoul accent] "We're going to a minga cafe."

836
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:48,148
Mainga cafe. Ménga cafe.

837
00:42:48,232 --> 00:42:49,650
-[laughs] -[sighs]

838
00:42:51,527 --> 00:42:53,404
[in normal voice] I can't do the Seoul accent.

839
00:42:57,491 --> 00:43:00,327
COMIC BOOK CAFE

840
00:43:05,541 --> 00:43:07,251
[Ye-rin] Look at that cat!

841
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:11,338
[Pyeong-seok] Wow, look at that.

842
00:43:12,047 --> 00:43:13,757
It's huge.

843
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:17,261
-Don't make eye contact. -[chuckles]

844
00:43:19,847 --> 00:43:21,640
I can't look at it, I'm scared.

845
00:43:21,724 --> 00:43:23,726
-[Ye-rin laughing] -[shuddering]

846
00:43:24,351 --> 00:43:26,895
Ah, Pyeong-seok is so cute.

847
00:43:26,979 --> 00:43:27,855
Aw!

848
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:29,857
I get why Hee-ji likes him.

849
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:31,650
-I wish she could see this. -Adorable.

850
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:35,237
-[Pyeong-seok] Should we each pick a book? -[Ye-rin] Come here.

851
00:43:36,905 --> 00:43:39,992
[Pyeong-seok] I heard that you guys exchanged books before I arrived.

852
00:43:40,534 --> 00:43:43,787
So, I suggested that we each pick one and give it to the other person.

853
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:48,083
I fell asleep during that movie.

854
00:43:48,834 --> 00:43:50,336
It's like a romance novel.

855
00:43:51,503 --> 00:43:53,297
[Ye-rin] What's wrong with romance?

856
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:55,382
-[Pyeong-seok] Ready? -[Ye-rin] Ready?

857
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:58,385
All right, let's exchange. One, two, three.

858
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:00,554
Here you are.

859
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:04,350
YOUR NAME.

860
00:44:04,933 --> 00:44:06,060
She picked Your Name.

861
00:44:06,143 --> 00:44:07,311
PYEONG-SEOK

862
00:44:07,394 --> 00:44:08,687
Maybe she likes my name.

863
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:12,650
[laughing]

864
00:44:12,733 --> 00:44:15,569
Q. WHAT BOOK DID YOU PICK FOR YE-RIN?

865
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:18,906
I wanted a book that Ye-rin could relate to.

866
00:44:21,867 --> 00:44:24,620
I picked that one because the girl on the cover looked like her.

867
00:44:27,748 --> 00:44:28,999
[both chuckling]

868
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:30,459
HIRING A FIANCÉ

869
00:44:30,542 --> 00:44:31,585
[Ye-rin] "Fiancé."

870
00:44:32,836 --> 00:44:33,796
Let's see.

871
00:44:44,264 --> 00:44:47,601
-[Pyeong-seok] I'm hungry. -[Ye-rin] Let's get some food.

872
00:44:50,312 --> 00:44:51,480
Oh, smells good.

873
00:44:51,563 --> 00:44:52,439
Looks good, too.

874
00:44:53,232 --> 00:44:54,358
Nice.

875
00:45:03,492 --> 00:45:04,326
Try it.

876
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:06,954
-All right. Bon appétit. -Bon appétit.

877
00:45:12,709 --> 00:45:14,795
Mm.

878
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:21,468
Is it good?

879
00:45:22,302 --> 00:45:23,262
You like to eat?

880
00:45:25,097 --> 00:45:26,849
What did you and Hee-ji talk about?

881
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:30,519
Did you talk about your first impressions?

882
00:45:31,645 --> 00:45:33,313
Yeah, things like that.

883
00:45:34,148 --> 00:45:36,066
What was your first impression of me?

884
00:45:36,817 --> 00:45:38,152
Were you intrigued?

885
00:45:39,445 --> 00:45:41,196
You looked like a celebrity.

886
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:42,156
Really?

887
00:45:43,198 --> 00:45:44,366
Yeah, you're tall.

888
00:45:45,617 --> 00:45:46,702
And you look cool.

889
00:45:47,494 --> 00:45:48,704
Mm.

890
00:45:49,371 --> 00:45:50,956
I wish you had told me earlier.

891
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,086
What about the guys?

892
00:45:58,088 --> 00:45:59,423
Se-yeon. [chuckles]

893
00:46:00,966 --> 00:46:01,967
He's fascinating.

894
00:46:02,676 --> 00:46:04,219
[Ye-rin] He looks like a doll.

895
00:46:05,345 --> 00:46:07,764
If you were a girl, would you date Se-yeon?

896
00:46:08,932 --> 00:46:09,766
Hm.

897
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:11,768
If I were a girl…

898
00:46:14,021 --> 00:46:14,855
I'd date me.

899
00:46:15,731 --> 00:46:17,024
[Pyeong-seok sighs]

900
00:46:20,194 --> 00:46:21,403
So, who do you like?

901
00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:22,905
Me?

902
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:24,990
Who do you like the most?

903
00:46:26,533 --> 00:46:29,828
I like Hee-ji the most.

904
00:46:31,872 --> 00:46:32,998
Anyone else?

905
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:34,500
No.

906
00:46:34,583 --> 00:46:36,210
No one else?

907
00:46:36,293 --> 00:46:38,086
[all] Whoa!

908
00:46:40,547 --> 00:46:42,049
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

909
00:46:43,592 --> 00:46:44,426
Attaboy.

910
00:46:45,302 --> 00:46:46,762
Pyeong-seok is so chill.

911
00:46:47,429 --> 00:46:49,431
-No. -No one else?

912
00:46:52,809 --> 00:46:54,144
Is this alcohol?

913
00:46:56,146 --> 00:46:57,272
[Pyeong-seok] By the way,

914
00:46:58,106 --> 00:46:59,608
when the girls are together,

915
00:47:00,108 --> 00:47:01,902
do they talk about the guys?

916
00:47:03,237 --> 00:47:04,112
We do.

917
00:47:06,073 --> 00:47:08,116
Pretty girls are all we talk about.

918
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:09,952
Really? Do you talk about Hee-ji?

919
00:47:11,036 --> 00:47:11,954
Of course.

920
00:47:14,623 --> 00:47:16,124
Do you talk about anyone else?

921
00:47:18,585 --> 00:47:20,128
I talk about you, too.

922
00:47:21,046 --> 00:47:22,798
In a good way or a bad way?

923
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:25,133
Just the facts.

924
00:47:25,926 --> 00:47:26,969
"She asked me out."

925
00:47:28,595 --> 00:47:30,722
I told them I was really surprised.

926
00:47:31,848 --> 00:47:34,142
And the guys just said, "Have fun!"

927
00:47:34,726 --> 00:47:36,395
-What about Se-yeon? -Se-yeon?

928
00:47:38,313 --> 00:47:39,314
I told Se-yeon…

929
00:47:41,858 --> 00:47:43,277
about the dream date.

930
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:44,528
Why'd you do that?

931
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:49,157
You never know.

932
00:47:49,866 --> 00:47:50,993
Things can change.

933
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:56,248
-And? -And?

934
00:47:57,332 --> 00:47:58,667
Who is he gonna ask out?

935
00:48:00,002 --> 00:48:01,461
He's still not sure.

936
00:48:02,379 --> 00:48:04,673
Me or… Or Ji-woo or…

937
00:48:05,507 --> 00:48:06,425
I don't know.

938
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:09,386
Oh.

939
00:48:14,016 --> 00:48:14,850
[chuckles]

940
00:48:15,851 --> 00:48:18,687
-What? -You seem preoccupied.

941
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:24,318
If Se-yeon uses his dream date on Ji-woo…

942
00:48:28,447 --> 00:48:30,115
I won't take it well.

943
00:48:30,824 --> 00:48:31,742
It'll hurt.

944
00:48:33,910 --> 00:48:34,745
Hm…

945
00:48:37,623 --> 00:48:39,458
During my date with Ye-rin,

946
00:48:39,541 --> 00:48:41,710
I could tell she had a lot on her mind.

947
00:48:41,793 --> 00:48:44,504
It was like she was somewhere else.

948
00:48:46,214 --> 00:48:49,551
So I realized she was thinking about Se-yeon.

949
00:48:52,012 --> 00:48:53,972
Are you picking Hee-ji for your dream date?

950
00:48:55,390 --> 00:48:56,308
I think so.

951
00:48:58,685 --> 00:48:59,519
[chuckles]

952
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:03,523
We were always together in school.

953
00:49:04,232 --> 00:49:05,150
We were partners.

954
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:08,236
We never switched.

955
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:09,821
My only partner was Jung-yun.

956
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:12,240
-It's too bad. -Yeah, it's a shame.

957
00:49:13,241 --> 00:49:14,701
There won't be a next time.

958
00:49:15,952 --> 00:49:16,870
That's sad.

959
00:49:24,419 --> 00:49:25,671
[Se-yeon] Where is everyone?

960
00:49:25,754 --> 00:49:27,464
[Jung-yun] I don't know. Check downstairs.

961
00:49:27,547 --> 00:49:31,468
-[Se-yeon] Uh, I'm cold. I'm cold. -[Jung-yun] Oh, I'm cold. I'm cold.

962
00:49:32,177 --> 00:49:35,097
-How was your work out? -Great. I feel much better.

963
00:49:36,348 --> 00:49:38,850
[Se-yeon] You're already having late-night snacks?

964
00:49:39,351 --> 00:49:41,395
-[Hee-ji] Boneless. -Should I eat now…

965
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:43,188
Nah.

966
00:49:43,855 --> 00:49:45,107
[Hee-ji] Why not?

967
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:47,150
I'm meeting in an hour and a half.

968
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:50,362
-[Hee-ji] How come? Oh… -Dinner date.

969
00:49:52,864 --> 00:49:54,449
I need to shower.

970
00:49:54,533 --> 00:49:55,992
You can shower first.

971
00:49:56,702 --> 00:49:57,744
[Se-yeon] Thanks.

972
00:50:04,376 --> 00:50:05,669
-Oh! -[Jung-yun sighs]

973
00:50:09,423 --> 00:50:10,340
[Ji-woo] Here.

974
00:50:11,049 --> 00:50:12,092
I found one more.

975
00:50:12,718 --> 00:50:15,053
He needs to talk to her before she goes out.

976
00:50:15,137 --> 00:50:17,097
Yeah. I hope he does.

977
00:50:19,975 --> 00:50:21,101
[Ji-woo] All right.

978
00:50:30,652 --> 00:50:32,821
[clicks tongue] I'm out.

979
00:50:32,904 --> 00:50:34,906
-He has to talk to her. -Ask her.

980
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:36,575
-Do it now. -Ask her.

981
00:50:37,284 --> 00:50:38,201
I'm out.

982
00:50:41,121 --> 00:50:42,247
Bye.

983
00:50:45,459 --> 00:50:46,626
-See ya. -[Ji-woo] Bye.

984
00:50:48,712 --> 00:50:49,921
I'll take this upstairs.

985
00:51:02,517 --> 00:51:03,602
[all groaning]

986
00:51:03,685 --> 00:51:04,561
Come on.

987
00:51:06,271 --> 00:51:07,564
Just go talk to her.

988
00:51:09,149 --> 00:51:11,109
He needs to go and tell her.

989
00:51:11,943 --> 00:51:14,738
-Just spit it out. -Yes, she wants to hear it.

990
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:28,668
I had plenty of opportunities to talk to Ji-woo before she went out.

991
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:30,378
JUNG-YUN

992
00:51:30,462 --> 00:51:32,297
But I didn't on purpose.

993
00:51:33,465 --> 00:51:34,716
I thought…

994
00:51:37,010 --> 00:51:38,553
If I go talk to her,

995
00:51:39,638 --> 00:51:42,224
it's going to be obvious that I care about her.

996
00:51:44,810 --> 00:51:46,853
-It should be obvious! -It should be!

997
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:49,731
-Jung-yun, you should make it obvious. -Why don't you?!

998
00:51:51,566 --> 00:51:53,235
He doesn't get it, does he?

999
00:51:53,735 --> 00:51:56,404
You're supposed to make it obvious.

1000
00:51:56,488 --> 00:51:59,908
He should make it obvious before she goes on her date.

1001
00:52:13,046 --> 00:52:15,382
He's putting on cologne, too?

1002
00:52:16,508 --> 00:52:18,552
Feels like today is a really big day.

1003
00:52:18,635 --> 00:52:19,803
Yeah, big day.

1004
00:52:21,012 --> 00:52:24,224
Up to now, Se-yeon has always made his bed.

1005
00:52:24,808 --> 00:52:26,893
-But today it's messy. -[Ji-eun] Not today.

1006
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:28,979
Which makes me think he's anxious.

1007
00:52:29,479 --> 00:52:31,565
-[Su-hyun] I agree. -This will be interesting.

1008
00:52:31,648 --> 00:52:33,149
JI-WOO &amp; SE-YEON'S DATE

1009
00:52:33,233 --> 00:52:35,318
-Hello. -Good evening. Good evening.

1010
00:52:37,946 --> 00:52:39,239
[Ji-woo] Are you hungry?

1011
00:52:40,156 --> 00:52:42,409
[Se-yeon] Yeah. I can't wait to eat.

1012
00:52:44,536 --> 00:52:46,746
-Good workout? -Yeah.

1013
00:52:48,039 --> 00:52:49,040
First, I ran.

1014
00:52:51,042 --> 00:52:53,336
-Is there a gym? -Near the house, yeah.

1015
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:56,298
They have these bands.

1016
00:52:57,507 --> 00:52:58,633
What kind of bands?

1017
00:52:59,426 --> 00:53:01,386
They're called resistance bands.

1018
00:53:01,469 --> 00:53:03,805
[chuckles] I've seen them.

1019
00:53:03,889 --> 00:53:05,390
You use them like this, right?

1020
00:53:06,308 --> 00:53:07,517
That's what you did?

1021
00:53:08,184 --> 00:53:09,644
I did a bunch of things.

1022
00:53:10,562 --> 00:53:12,147
You were there for a long time.

1023
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:14,190
Really? I thought I was pretty fast.

1024
00:53:14,774 --> 00:53:16,818
-Not fast enough. -Were you waiting?

1025
00:53:17,402 --> 00:53:18,278
Really?

1026
00:53:19,070 --> 00:53:20,864
Of course. We have dinner plans.

1027
00:53:23,366 --> 00:53:25,452
What did you eat with Jung-yun yesterday?

1028
00:53:26,328 --> 00:53:28,079
Yesterday? We had Japanese.

1029
00:53:29,456 --> 00:53:30,457
Izakaya style?

1030
00:53:31,291 --> 00:53:33,043
Yeah, we had Nagasaki champon,

1031
00:53:33,627 --> 00:53:34,628
sushi,

1032
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:37,005
and beef stir-fry.

1033
00:53:38,214 --> 00:53:39,215
That's it.

1034
00:53:40,425 --> 00:53:42,719
-Oh, are we here? -[Se-yeon] We've arrived.

1035
00:53:43,428 --> 00:53:44,554
[Ji-woo] It's so close.

1036
00:53:51,519 --> 00:53:53,146
-[Se-yeon] This is it. -Let's go.

1037
00:53:54,064 --> 00:53:54,898
Thank you.

1038
00:54:02,113 --> 00:54:03,490
What else did you do today?

1039
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:05,909
Not much, really.

1040
00:54:05,992 --> 00:54:07,285
Time flew by fast.

1041
00:54:07,869 --> 00:54:08,703
Right.

1042
00:54:08,787 --> 00:54:11,081
That's the one thing about the house.

1043
00:54:11,164 --> 00:54:13,041
The real fun starts in the evening.

1044
00:54:13,124 --> 00:54:14,709
Yeah, everyone comes alive at night.

1045
00:54:14,793 --> 00:54:17,128
-That's the time. -We're out right now.

1046
00:54:18,046 --> 00:54:19,965
Let the good times roll. [chuckles]

1047
00:54:22,884 --> 00:54:24,386
Why are you smiling?

1048
00:54:24,469 --> 00:54:26,429
Huh? Oh, nothing.

1049
00:54:27,222 --> 00:54:28,640
It's a little funny, that's all.

1050
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:31,059
[Ji-woo chuckles]

1051
00:54:31,851 --> 00:54:32,769
You smiled.

1052
00:54:33,269 --> 00:54:34,521
Why did you smile?

1053
00:54:34,604 --> 00:54:36,648
Probably the same reason as you.

1054
00:54:37,941 --> 00:54:38,858
I guess.

1055
00:54:48,952 --> 00:54:51,830
-[waiter] Here's your pasta. -[Se-yeon] In the center, please.

1056
00:54:52,872 --> 00:54:54,833
-[Ji-woo] Looks so good. -[Se-yeon] Let's eat.

1057
00:54:54,916 --> 00:54:55,750
[Ji-woo] Amazing.

1058
00:54:57,669 --> 00:54:59,129
-Shall I? -I'll do it.

1059
00:55:01,381 --> 00:55:02,799
There's scallops, too.

1060
00:55:02,882 --> 00:55:04,926
It said scallops and shrimp.

1061
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:06,928
-Here. We could just… -Thanks.

1062
00:55:07,012 --> 00:55:09,222
-Eat from the plate? -Yeah, let's do that.

1063
00:55:16,771 --> 00:55:19,357
-They're good, right? -The scallops are so good.

1064
00:55:20,567 --> 00:55:21,776
-So good. -So good.

1065
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:25,280
[Se-yeon] Do you mind if I cut it?

1066
00:55:26,865 --> 00:55:27,699
Say "aah."

1067
00:55:30,076 --> 00:55:30,910
Mm.

1068
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:34,247
-I like this one even more. -Right?

1069
00:55:34,956 --> 00:55:36,833
Se-yeon is pretty straightforward.

1070
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:40,086
Now that he's made up his mind, he's more direct.

1071
00:55:41,379 --> 00:55:42,297
Mm.

1072
00:55:48,553 --> 00:55:50,555
-What are you doing? -I see you.

1073
00:55:51,222 --> 00:55:52,182
Se-yeon.

1074
00:55:52,974 --> 00:55:53,975
You're in the glass.

1075
00:55:57,937 --> 00:55:58,855
[chuckles]

1076
00:56:00,607 --> 00:56:02,192
-Mm. -Do you see me?

1077
00:56:02,275 --> 00:56:03,109
Yeah.

1078
00:56:07,155 --> 00:56:08,156
[Ji-woo] It's good.

1079
00:56:08,239 --> 00:56:09,699
Yeah, it's peppermint tea.

1080
00:56:12,285 --> 00:56:13,328
It smells good, too.

1081
00:56:16,456 --> 00:56:19,084
Feels different, being here, out of the house.

1082
00:56:19,167 --> 00:56:22,212
Yeah, the others got on my case,

1083
00:56:22,921 --> 00:56:25,340
asking me what took us so long yesterday.

1084
00:56:25,423 --> 00:56:26,549
-The girls? -Yeah.

1085
00:56:27,133 --> 00:56:29,052
Apparently we talked for two hours.

1086
00:56:30,637 --> 00:56:31,638
What did you say?

1087
00:56:31,721 --> 00:56:34,474
I told them we talked about meaningless stuff.

1088
00:56:34,557 --> 00:56:37,268
I didn't want to share the details of our conversation.

1089
00:56:37,352 --> 00:56:38,311
"Meaningless stuff"?

1090
00:56:38,394 --> 00:56:40,522
-Meaningless? -No, that's just what I told them.

1091
00:56:40,605 --> 00:56:42,607
I wasn't gonna say we winked at each other.

1092
00:56:43,358 --> 00:56:44,192
Why not?

1093
00:56:47,112 --> 00:56:48,655
Fine. I'll tell them next time.

1094
00:56:48,738 --> 00:56:50,698
No, no. Let's keep it a secret.

1095
00:56:51,407 --> 00:56:52,742
-Okay. Yes. -[Se-yeon] Yeah.

1096
00:56:53,451 --> 00:56:56,037
-[Ji-woo] Keep it our secret. -Keep it a secret.

1097
00:56:56,121 --> 00:56:57,038
Yeah, our secret.

1098
00:56:58,164 --> 00:57:00,458
How do you approach dating?

1099
00:57:01,042 --> 00:57:02,252
[inhales deeply]

1100
00:57:03,837 --> 00:57:06,339
I take my time to get to know the other person.

1101
00:57:07,215 --> 00:57:09,050
So I'm pretty cautious.

1102
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:12,220
I keep my cards close to my chest.

1103
00:57:12,303 --> 00:57:13,721
[inhales sharply]

1104
00:57:14,556 --> 00:57:16,683
It's hard for me to say how I feel.

1105
00:57:18,726 --> 00:57:20,145
But with you, I did.

1106
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:21,896
Now you know, right?

1107
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:23,773
[chuckling] Yes. Now I know.

1108
00:57:23,857 --> 00:57:27,026
But, early on, I had no idea.

1109
00:57:31,865 --> 00:57:33,992
I need time to really know the person, too.

1110
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:36,995
Once it took me more than six months.

1111
00:57:37,078 --> 00:57:38,663
Oh, wow.

1112
00:57:38,746 --> 00:57:42,542
It usually takes me a couple months before opening up.

1113
00:57:43,376 --> 00:57:45,295
What are you like when you're dating?

1114
00:57:46,212 --> 00:57:47,380
Me?

1115
00:57:48,381 --> 00:57:50,884
I become cuter.

1116
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:56,139
-You become cuter? -Yeah. It's not intentional.

1117
00:57:56,222 --> 00:57:57,348
Oh.

1118
00:57:57,432 --> 00:57:58,850
It just happens.

1119
00:57:59,934 --> 00:58:00,935
Even cuter?

1120
00:58:01,019 --> 00:58:02,729
[Ji-woo] Is it that surprising?

1121
00:58:02,812 --> 00:58:05,398
-[Se-yeon] Not at all. -Did you think I get mean?

1122
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:08,693
I didn't think you could get any cuter. How did the guys react?

1123
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:10,195
They love it.

1124
00:58:11,237 --> 00:58:12,739
They love it, huh?

1125
00:58:13,656 --> 00:58:15,492
All right. Okay.

1126
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:18,828
I was wondering if you have a type.

1127
00:58:20,205 --> 00:58:21,831
I'd say someone who's upbeat.

1128
00:58:23,291 --> 00:58:26,544
Someone who's easy to talk to and who has a sense of humor.

1129
00:58:32,091 --> 00:58:34,636
The more I talked to Ji-woo and got to know her,

1130
00:58:36,888 --> 00:58:39,516
the more she was turning into my ideal girl.

1131
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:41,851
That's really cool.

1132
00:58:53,947 --> 00:58:54,781
Oh…

1133
00:58:59,619 --> 00:59:00,745
I almost winked.

1134
00:59:00,828 --> 00:59:01,663
Me too.

1135
00:59:02,497 --> 00:59:05,416
It wasn't intentional. I just did it.

1136
00:59:08,127 --> 00:59:08,962
JI-WOO

1137
00:59:09,045 --> 00:59:11,172
I had a good time with Jung-yun,

1138
00:59:12,382 --> 00:59:14,884
but I was left pretty disappointed.

1139
00:59:14,968 --> 00:59:18,721
My date with Se-yeon was a lot more satisfying and fun.

1140
00:59:19,347 --> 00:59:20,932
It felt like the perfect date.

1141
00:59:22,308 --> 00:59:23,351
Aw.

1142
00:59:24,310 --> 00:59:26,521
Se-yeon definitely likes Ji-woo.

1143
00:59:26,604 --> 00:59:29,357
-[Kyuhyun] Yeah. -He gets a little shy around her.

1144
00:59:31,109 --> 00:59:32,986
I know he's growing more fond of her,

1145
00:59:33,069 --> 00:59:35,905
but I'm not sure how Ji-woo feels.

1146
00:59:35,989 --> 00:59:37,156
Here's what I think.

1147
00:59:38,533 --> 00:59:41,035
Ji-woo's not sure she wants to be in a relationship

1148
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:44,330
where she likes the guy more or the guy likes her more.

1149
00:59:44,414 --> 00:59:45,331
Good point.

1150
00:59:46,249 --> 00:59:48,293
I'd say she wants to like the guy more.

1151
00:59:49,210 --> 00:59:51,754
-It's hard to tell. -[Ji-eun] We shall see.

1152
00:59:58,595 --> 00:59:59,429
That's cute.

1153
01:00:00,305 --> 01:00:02,348
-Really? You think I'm cute? -Yeah.

1154
01:00:02,432 --> 01:00:03,266
[chuckles]

1155
01:00:04,809 --> 01:00:06,394
Your nostrils just flared.

1156
01:00:06,477 --> 01:00:07,729
[chuckles] My nostrils?

1157
01:00:08,438 --> 01:00:09,981
[both] Hm.

1158
01:00:17,822 --> 01:00:18,781
[laughs]

1159
01:00:19,699 --> 01:00:21,326
Did my nostrils flare again?

1160
01:00:29,167 --> 01:00:30,460
We talked a lot today.

1161
01:00:31,586 --> 01:00:32,587
Didn't we?

1162
01:00:33,796 --> 01:00:34,964
Wasn't it nice?

1163
01:00:35,715 --> 01:00:37,008
Yeah, it was really nice.

1164
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:38,843
Really nice.

1165
01:00:40,136 --> 01:00:42,680
You're easy to talk to.

1166
01:00:42,764 --> 01:00:45,558
Isn't it one of the qualities you look for in a girl?

1167
01:00:45,642 --> 01:00:47,560
-Huh? -Easy to talk to.

1168
01:00:47,644 --> 01:00:48,645
Oh.

1169
01:00:49,395 --> 01:00:50,480
You're right.

1170
01:00:51,064 --> 01:00:52,357
You're more than my type.

1171
01:00:53,733 --> 01:00:55,026
You're my ideal girl.

1172
01:00:55,109 --> 01:00:55,943
Really?

1173
01:00:56,444 --> 01:00:57,737
And you look pretty, too.

1174
01:00:58,237 --> 01:00:59,989
Oh. [softly] Wow.

1175
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:08,498
Wanna watch something?

1176
01:01:23,137 --> 01:01:24,013
ONE HOUR LATER

1177
01:01:24,097 --> 01:01:25,223
[Ji-woo] Can you talk?

1178
01:01:28,476 --> 01:01:29,727
[Ji-woo groans]

1179
01:01:30,853 --> 01:01:32,355
-Take me back home. -What?

1180
01:01:32,438 --> 01:01:34,440
-I don't feel good. -Why?

1181
01:01:34,524 --> 01:01:37,694
I feel like they're just playing with me.

1182
01:01:40,905 --> 01:01:43,324
-They're just playing. -[Hee-ji] What do you mean?

1183
01:01:44,158 --> 01:01:45,368
-Hmm? -[sniffles]

1184
01:01:46,828 --> 01:01:50,832
I mean, he shouldn't have made me think that he liked me.

1185
01:01:52,208 --> 01:01:53,543
It's messed up.

1186
01:01:54,752 --> 01:01:58,339
We came here to have fun, how dare he play with my emotions?

1187
01:01:59,382 --> 01:02:00,967
They're all toying with me.

1188
01:02:04,262 --> 01:02:06,264
[closing theme music playing]
