[Hee-ji] I can't wait. I smell tempura.

[waiter] Hi, what can I get you?

00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:41,434
-Hello. -Hi.

29
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,770
Two servings of the…

30
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:45,563
-Sukiyaki. -Sukiyaki Kansai-style.

31
00:01:46,397 --> 00:01:49,442
And highball. Two glasses.

32
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:51,277
-[waiter] Two highballs? -Yes.

33
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:53,905

34
00:01:54,572 --> 00:01:55,532
Here.

35
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:58,451
Great. Thank you.

36
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:00,328
-I'll put in your order. -Great.

37
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:03,581
-It's so cute. -She stored her ID in her phone.

38
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:04,833
[Kyuhyun] Wow.

39
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:06,709
-Adorable. -She won't lose it.

40
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:08,711
-I should do that too. -[Se-woon] Yeah.

41
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:11,673
-[waiter] Two highballs. -[Hee-ji] That's us.

-[waiter] Enjoy. -[Hee-ji] Wow.

44
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:20,890
This is nice.

45
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:24,978
-[Pyeong-seok] Wow! -[Hee-ji] Smells good.

46
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,730
I think we need to stir it.

47

[Hee-ji] My first highball.

48
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:34,487

Cheers.

51
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,506
-Mm. -Oh, it's good.

52
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:57,218
It's perfect. I love it.

53
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:00,179
The taste of adulthood.

54
00:03:02,223 --> 00:03:03,641
[Hee-ji] We're adults.

55
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:04,726
PYEONG-SEOK

56
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:08,313
It was my first time ordering cocktails and eating that kind of food.

57
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:11,065
It was a lot first times

58
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:14,986
and I got to experience them with Hee-ji.

59
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:16,362
HEE-JI

60
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:17,989
It felt a bit weird

61
00:03:18,072 --> 00:03:21,034
because a guy who used to be my school partner…

62
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:22,076
Cheers.

63
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,288
…was now sitting across from me as my date.

64
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:31,377
But once I got over the weirdness, I had a really nice time.

65
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:35,298
Mm, I love cabbage.

66
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:37,508
I'll put in a lot then.

67
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:39,093
[chuckles]

68
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:43,431
-Cabbage. -[Hee-ji] I love it. I do.

69
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:47,143
-Enjoy. -Bon appétit.

70
00:03:51,272 --> 00:03:52,273
Mm.

71
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:57,445
[Pyeong-seok] Mm.

72
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:01,574
This is so good.

73
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:06,496
It's sweet. Delicious.

74
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:10,291
-Good food makes me happy. -[Hee-ji] Yeah.

75
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:18,758
This konjac reminds me of Busan.

76
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:21,344
Ah, Busan?

77
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:23,513
What places have you visited?

78
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:26,474
-I've seen most of South Korea. -[Hee-ji] Really?

79
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:28,768
Yeah. But I've never been abroad.

80
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:29,894
Hm.

81
00:04:30,728 --> 00:04:33,147
What's your favorite place in South Korea?

82
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:35,066
Seoul.

83
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:36,276
[both chuckle]

84
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,696
[Pyeong-seok laughs] What?

85
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:45,493
-I wasn't raised in a big city. -Hm.

86
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:47,787
I'm a country boy.

87
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:51,082
That's cute.

88
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:54,669
-Seoul? -It's so pretty at night.

89
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:57,046
-And when you're biking… -Biking?

90
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,548
…it's ever prettier.

91
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:02,427
I like biking, too.

92
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:06,222
-What kind of bike? -A road bike.

93
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:08,391
Really?

94
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:10,727
Hm.

95
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:13,396
Let's bike together sometime.

96
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:14,981
[both chuckle]

97
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:17,442
I can show you around,

98
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:20,361
take you to some big city places.

99
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:22,488
[chuckling]

100
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:26,117
I used to ride a fixie.

101
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,703
Hm. I remember those.

102
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:29,954
[chuckles]

103
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:32,999
From way back when?

104
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:38,296
I got in trouble for riding one without brakes once.

105
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:39,922
That's hilarious.

106
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:44,093
-And what about sports? -Me?

107
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:46,137
Uh…

108
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:48,848
I'm at the Hapkido gym a lot.

109
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:52,185
-Me too growing up. [chuckles] -Really?

110
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:57,440
[Hee-ji chuckles]

111
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:01,027
This is fun.

112
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:05,782
Mm, the egg tastes so good.

113
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,785
You can also dip gyukatsu in there.

114
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:11,913
-Have you tried? -Huh?

115
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:13,998
-Gyukatsu. -[high-pitched] "Gyukatsu"?

116
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:15,583
[giggles]

117
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:18,503
"Gyuka"? Gyukatsu?

118
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:19,629
[all laughing]

119
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:21,589
-Why is he saying it like that? -"Gyukatsu?"

120
00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:23,007
[Su-hyun] Like Pikachu?

121
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:27,303
-"Gyuka"? Gyukatsu? -[both chuckle]

122
00:06:27,386 --> 00:06:29,347
[in normal voice] What's gyukatsu?

123
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:35,812
-"Gyu"? -We'll try it next time.

124
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:41,442
You're gonna dream about gyukatsu. [laughs]

125
00:06:43,861 --> 00:06:45,154
[chuckling]

126
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:51,369
-[mimicking] "Gyuka?" -[Ji-eun] "Gyukatsu."

127
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:53,704
Oh, my God. Pyeong-seok's gonna become a meme.

128
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:55,706
-Yeah. -A meme.

129
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:58,167
Hee-ji and Pyeong-seok are already on a dream date.

130
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:00,461
-That's true. -They set the bar high.

131
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:02,630
They have great chemistry.

132
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:05,174
Yes, and they have things in common, like biking.

133
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:07,426
They're a good match.

134
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:09,887
[Jung-yun] Do you want some beer?

135
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:11,639
[Se-yeon] Yeah. Let's have some beers.

136
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:13,808
To us.

137
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:14,934
-To us. -To us.

138
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:16,394
[all laughing]

139
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:23,484
I'm getting wasted tonight.

140
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:26,612
-Wasted? -Nice. I might want real talk.

141
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:29,824
Just saying.

142
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:34,245
-I need to drink more for real talk. -[Ye-rin] Well, then drink.

143
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:37,707
-To our twenties. -[all] Cheers!

144
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:40,751
Drink up.

145
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:44,505
Ah.

146
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:50,386
-Cheers. -[Se-yeon] Cheers.

147
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:00,188
[Jung-yun] I don't understand why people drink.

148
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:01,981
[Jung-yun] I'll drink to that.

149
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:06,527
I need to eat more to sober up.

150
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:09,489
All right. Now…

151
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:13,075
let's finish our drinks.

152
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:16,078
-Then go outside? -[Se-yeon] Yes.

153
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:19,582
Should the four of us hang out together?

154
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:24,128
Or should we split into pairs to have some one-on-one time?

155
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:26,255
-I don't care. -Me neither.

156
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:28,925
Let's pair up.

157
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,176
-Then mix it up? -Yeah.

158
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:33,804
-They make their own rules now. -That's cool.

159
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:36,724
-Se-yeon is like the ring leader. -[Su-hyun] He's good.

160
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,601
I'm happy for them.

161
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:42,480
[Se-yeon] You guys wanna go outside now?

162
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:43,898
[Jung-yun] Let's go.

163
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,070
-This time… -Can you spin me?

164
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:51,447
-Hm? -Like a merry-go-round.

165
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,407
-Spin you around? -Yes. [chuckles]

166
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:56,452
-You're drunk. -[laughs]

167
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:03,834
So, we went to school for a week and we've been here for a day.

168
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:06,837
How do feel in general?

169
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:10,925
I feel…

170
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:15,721
Back at school, I was like, "Whatever. Everything will be fine."

171
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:18,641
I mean, you know, it's just school.

172
00:09:19,475 --> 00:09:23,854
But now that I'm in the house with dream dates and total freedom,

173
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:27,733
it feels like progress, but it's overwhelming.

174
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:28,734
[Se-yeon] Hm.

175
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:32,446
I'm wondering what should I do.

176
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:34,073
Am I being true to myself?

177
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:39,745
I have a lot on my mind, too.

178
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:46,252
-At school we had the no-dating rule. -Right.

179
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:48,379
So my goal was pretty simple.

180
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:52,300
I just had to make new friends.

181
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:58,014
What I didn't expect was that I developed strong feelings for someone.

182
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:03,269
Are you saying that you fell for someone?

183
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:06,397
Back at school…

184
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:11,819
you made my heart skip a beat or two.

185
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:13,863
[chuckles]

186
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:17,825
I realized something just now.

187
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:20,911
I used to have zero interest in dating.

188
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:22,622
Dating? What for?

189
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:27,043
And I've never been in a relationship.

190
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:30,171
I didn't expect to fall for anyone, really.

191
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:31,380
[Se-yeon] Hm.

192
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,469
And yet I kinda fell for you.

193
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:40,598
We had that thing at the library.

194
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:45,686
That was really special.

195
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:50,399
Yeah, you've been my number-one guy ever since the library.

196
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:02,620
We spent a lot of time together at school.

197
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:03,579
[Ye-rin] Mm.

198
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:09,126
I didn't wanna spend time with anyone else.

199
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:13,506
You were the only one.

200
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:16,300
[Ji-eun gasps]

201
00:11:17,676 --> 00:11:18,677
[sighs]

202
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:20,971
"You were," past tense.

203
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:23,432
-[Se-woon] You were the only one. -[Kyuhyun] You were.

204
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,061
You were the only one.

205
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:30,689
-I was? -You were the only one.

206
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:34,985
But a lot of things have changed since school.

207
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:38,489
I wanna spend time with other people in the house,

208
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:40,199
do things with them.

209
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:43,536
Otherwise I'll feel like I'm missing out.

210
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:45,996
Yeah, if I only focus on you,

211
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,290
I'm afraid I'll miss out on other people.

212
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:53,921
So I have a lot of things to figure out.

213
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:57,508
It's all very confusing.

214
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:00,636
I've got some thinking to do.

215
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:09,437
The last thing I want is for you to feel pressured.

216
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,604
Mm.

217
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:15,901
I tried to tell you on the Ferris wheel, but we ran out of time.

218
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:20,072
We still have a lot to learn about each other.

219
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,451
No need to rush into a decision.

220
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:28,414
Even if you go on a date with someone else,

221
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:30,291
I can take it.

222
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:33,335
I won't be sad, honestly.

223
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:43,429
That's how I feel right now and I wanna be honest about how I feel.

224
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:47,141
Me, too. I wanna be honest about how I feel,

225
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:49,143
like, who I'm attracted to,

226
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:52,146
who's on my mind.

227
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:56,400
[Se-yeon] It's so hard.

228
00:12:57,693 --> 00:12:58,944
[Ye-rin] Being honest is.

229
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:05,159
What a great conversation.

230
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:08,245
Wow. That talk was really mature for their age.

231
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:10,206
Ye-rin is so thoughtful.

232
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:13,417
-Just like we were unsure, so was she. -[Se-woon] Yeah.

233
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:17,213
She can't tell if Se-yeon's feelings for her have changed.

234
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:20,132
She just totally opened up about falling for him,

235
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:22,426
but when he said he wanted to keep exploring,

236
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,845
-she was, like, no pressure. -Yeah.

237
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:27,973
-She handled it like a grown up. -[Se-woon] That's true.

238
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:30,476
But is she gonna be okay?

239
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:33,729
I was wondering that, too. No, I don't think she'll be okay.

240
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:35,147
-Right. -How could she be?

241
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:38,275
-After all, he was her first crush. -[Kyuhyun] Right.

242
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:40,194
She knows how attentive he can be.

243
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:44,990
If he acts like that with another girl, I don't think she'll say, "I can take it."

244
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:49,703
On the other hand, he can't stay with her out of guilt.

245
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:51,914
-Right. -That's the worst.

246
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:54,291
I'm glad they got to clear the air.

247
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:58,170
That was a perfect time to have a perfect talk.

248
00:13:58,254 --> 00:13:59,129
[Kyuhyun] Yeah.

249
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:01,590
[Jung-yun] I like it here.

250
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:02,883
-[Ji-woo] You do? -Yeah.

251
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:05,719
[Ji-woo] Any questions for me?

252
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:09,890
What's gonna happen at midnight?

253
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:11,642
Nobody knows.

254
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:13,227
True.

255
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:16,772
What's your ideal girl like?

256
00:14:16,855 --> 00:14:18,232
Me? I don't know.

257
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:19,400
-You don't? -No.

258
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:22,444
-You must at least have a type. -[Jung-yun] No.

259
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:26,740
[Ji-woo] Any questions for me?

260
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:30,286
[chuckles]

261
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:35,708
[Ji-woo chuckles]

262
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:39,962
Is there someone else you'd like to go on a date with?

263
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:41,171
-No. -Really?

264
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:43,299
There's no one else.

265
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,510
What if I had someone else?

266
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,763
Would you still go out with me?

267
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:52,516
Would I?

268
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:55,352
It's a secret.

269
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,897
[chuckles]

270
00:15:09,116 --> 00:15:12,244
I'll tell you later. I'll tell you later.

271
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:14,872
[chuckles]

272
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:20,419
How about a date?

273
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:22,630
You and me?

274
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:27,968
-Okay. -Okay.

275
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:34,934
-What do you want to do tomorrow? -Tomorrow?

276
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,478
I just wanna be with you.

277
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:47,196
Wow! Ji-woo said yes.

278
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,239
Yes. She knows what she wants.

279
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:52,076
-[sighs] Game over. -[Ji-eun] She made up her mind.

280
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:55,996
-They kept looking at one another. -Yeah.

281
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,791
Once they locked eyes, that's how they communicated.

282
00:15:58,874 --> 00:15:59,833
[Kyuhyun] Wow.

283
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:01,168
SEO-YEONG &amp; JI-MIN'S DATE

284
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:03,879
-[Ji-min] I'm excited. -[Seo-yeong] I'm excited, too.

285
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:08,050
It's our first time at a restaurant.

286
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:09,468
That's true.

287
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:11,971
I'm super hungry.

288
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:14,807
You barely ate yesterday.

289
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:17,559
Actually, I only eat once a day, so…

290
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:29,446
-I hope the food's good. -Me too.

291
00:16:35,452 --> 00:16:37,955
-Do you like the house? Hm. -The house?

292
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:41,083
-It's more fun than I expected. -[Seo-yeong] Really?

293
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:44,795
Which do you prefer? The house or the school?

294
00:16:44,878 --> 00:16:47,464
Honestly, I liked PE at school,

295
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:50,259
but, otherwise, I prefer the house.

296
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:52,136
The party was so much fun.

297
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:56,557
-What about you? -Same, the House.

298
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,143
-The house? -Yeah. It's more…

299
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:05,107
There's a lot more things we can do. Like going on dates.

300
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:08,277
-Yeah, it's nice. -Yeah.

301
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:16,577
-Ji-min's not interested at all. -He's not looking at her.

302
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,579
[Ji-eun] He's just there for the food.

303
00:17:18,662 --> 00:17:21,498
-They act like an old couple. -Ooh, harsh, but true.

304
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:23,542
[exhales]

305
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:27,546
[waiter] Here you are.

306
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:29,423
[Ji-min] Thank you.

307
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:31,508
-Wow! -[Seo-yeong] Wow.

308
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:32,468
[Ji-min] Let's eat.

309
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:34,261
-[Seo-yeong] Bon appétit. -Yeah.

310
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:41,185
[waiter] And here's your wine.

311
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:46,482
Enjoy.

312
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:55,699
Mm.

313
00:17:58,035 --> 00:17:59,161
Mm.

314
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,585
What time do you wanna go back?

315
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:09,755
You don't know?

316
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:12,674
I wanna go to bed right away, then get up at midnight.

317
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:15,511
Mm. That's your plan?

318
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:17,137
Be up for the reveal?

319
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:19,765
That and I want to hang out with the others.

320
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:25,104
I don't want to miss out. I don't like missing out.

321
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:27,731
Yeah. I can tell.

322
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:40,327
It was painful.

323
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:42,579
SEO-YEONG

324
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:46,542
He really made no effort to talk to me.

325
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:49,503
It was like pulling teeth.

326
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:51,964
It's pretty clear now

327
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:54,299
that this is how far it will go with Ji-min.

328
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:57,678
I realize he just wants to be friends.

329
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:04,101
Why even go on a date if you're going to behave that way?

330
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:07,771
-And Seo-yeong was trying so hard. -[Su-hyun] Yeah.

331
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:10,357
Meanwhile, Ji-min is not even bothering.

332
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,526
So it's totally one-sided.

333
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:14,486
-Hm. -[Ji-eun and Su-hyun] Yeah.

334
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:17,239
He's passive-aggressive and making her feel bad.

335
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:18,448
[Su-hyun] That's right.

336
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:22,369
Since he agreed to the date, he shouldn't look like

337
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:23,996
he doesn't wanna be there.

338
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:26,331
-It's like he's trying to avoid her. -I agree.

339
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:27,958
-It's disappointing. -It is.

340
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:29,793
Yeah, avoiding is not the way to go.

341
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:32,337
But Seo-yeong did great under the circumstances.

342
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:34,214
-She said her truth. -She did.

343
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:35,591
She did.

344
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:36,925
SANG-WON &amp; SEO-HYEON'S DATE

345
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:38,260
[Seo-hyeon] I can't wait.

346
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:41,555
-Thank you. -Thank you.

347
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:43,640
[Sang-won] Look at that.

348
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:45,851
[Seo-hyeon] Yukhoe is the real deal.

349
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,649
-[Sang-won] Wow. -So good.

350
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:56,069
-Amazing, huh? -Try the sushi.

351
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:57,988
Do you like sushi?

352
00:19:58,071 --> 00:19:59,489
Hm.

353
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:10,751
-Wanna toast? -I do. With only one hand.

354
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:21,970
-Oh, no. -Bitter?

355
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:23,388
It's gross.

356
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:26,350
Here, have some food.

357
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:30,103
Mm, that's good.

358
00:20:30,812 --> 00:20:33,941
Do you like movies? What do you like?

359
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:36,026
-I like to cross-stitch. -Cross-stitch?

360
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:37,444
Yeah, with beads.

361
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:39,446
-I can do it all night. -It's funny.

362
00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:41,698
I went to buy something on New Year's Eve,

363
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:44,034
and they were selling beaded cross-stitch.

364
00:20:44,117 --> 00:20:45,911
And I had no idea what it was.

365
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,789
I was like, "What's that?"

366
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:51,625
They had so many varieties, including, like, stickers.

367
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:54,628
-You should try it someday. -Will you show me?

368
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:55,921
Absolutely.

369
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:59,383
-May I ask you a question? -Sure.

370
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:01,927
-Your ideal guy? -[Seo-hyeon] Ideal guy…

371
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:04,972
I don't really have a specific type.

372
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:09,309
But I do have a thing for nice eyes.

373
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:10,519
Nice eyes?

374
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:12,396
That's subjective.

375
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:13,522
-Huh? -That's subjective.

376
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:17,025
-I guess it is. -[Sang-won] A guy with nice eyes.

377
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:18,819
-Yeah. -And personality wise?

378
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:20,237
Personality wise…

379
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:22,572
Hm.

380
00:21:25,575 --> 00:21:28,203
Someone who melts my heart. [chuckles]

381
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:30,580
-That's subjective, too. -Totally.

382
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:32,124
[laughs] Even more so.

383
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:33,834
Here's the thing.

384
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:35,877
I don't have a type,

385
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:39,047
but there are people I'm naturally drawn to.

386
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:41,383
I can't explain why.

387
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:44,219
[Sang-won] That's complicated.

388
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:47,472
Honestly, I don't always know how I really feel.

389
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:49,474
It's hard.

390
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:54,438
-Introspection is hard. -Yeah, exactly.

391
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:57,691
-What about you? -I don't have a type either.

392
00:21:57,774 --> 00:21:58,859
Hm?

393
00:21:58,942 --> 00:22:00,736
I guess when I'm attracted to a girl,

394
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:03,238
then she becomes my type, my ideal type.

395
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:07,034
Ooh.

396
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:11,371
What are you looking forward to in college?

397
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:13,332
-[Seo-hyeon] Me? -Mm-hmm.

398
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:15,584
-The festivals. -[Sang-won] The festivals?

399
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:18,587
Yeah, festivals are fun.

400
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,797
-So I should be excited? -[Sang-won] Oh, yeah.

401
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:24,009
As a freshman, you can ask any senior to buy you a meal.

402
00:22:25,093 --> 00:22:28,221
You just walk up to a senior and ask?

403
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:30,474
We have this tradition called a "meal deal."

404
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:32,267
We go two for two.

405
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:36,521
The senior buys the meal for two

406
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:39,274
and the freshman pays for coffee and cab fare.

407
00:22:39,357 --> 00:22:41,234
Hm, that's cool.

408
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:43,320
You ask, "Wanna grab something to eat?"

409
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:45,781
And during the meal you get to know one another.

410
00:22:46,823 --> 00:22:50,160
When I started college, I really hated the social life.

411
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:53,246
-I was looking for meaningful connections. -Mm.

412
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:56,583
But a lot of students didn't take friendship that seriously.

413
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:59,461
They were kind of flaky and superficial.

414
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:01,880
-Mm-hmm. -That was a bummer.

415
00:23:03,131 --> 00:23:05,550
Sang-won is about to be a sophomore in college.

416
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:06,635
SEO-HYEON

417
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:09,679
But… he's so mature.

418
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:11,765
He might as well be a senior.

419
00:23:12,682 --> 00:23:15,310
I've really enjoyed spending time with him.

420
00:23:16,311 --> 00:23:20,148
So much so that I might be confusing a nice friendship

421
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:22,317
with an actual crush.

422
00:23:22,984 --> 00:23:25,278
I can't tell the difference right now.

423
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:27,989
I think the only way I'll know how I really feel

424
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:30,659
is if I go on more dates with him.

425
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:33,370
Right now, the lines are a little blurred.

426
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:36,790
-[all exclaim] -[Kyuhyun] Wow.

427
00:23:36,873 --> 00:23:38,917
-I'd be confused too. -Wow.

428
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,755
She says she can't tell the difference… between friendship and an actual crush.

429
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:46,424
If she spends even more time with Sang-won,

430
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:49,553
-how will she get to know anyone else? -[Su-hyun] That's true.

431
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:53,265
-She might have a change of heart. -[Ji-eun] Yeah, after that day.

432
00:23:53,348 --> 00:23:54,891
I can't keep track with those two.

433
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:58,228
-Like she said, the lines are blurred. -[Kyuhyun] Yeah. [sighs]

434
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:01,523
[Seo-yeong] Let's go inside.

435
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:09,156
-Are you tired? You're home early. -Back so soon?

436
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:11,074
-We ate fast. -Let's hang out.

437
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:13,160
-Oh, everyone is downstairs. -What?

438
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:14,536
-Oh, yeah. -Is there food?

439
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:16,288
[Ji-woo] Yeah, we were about to eat.

440
00:24:16,371 --> 00:24:17,998
-That's awesome. -[Jung-yun] So?

441
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:23,461
-You said you weren't sure. -I said it was a secret.

442
00:24:24,087 --> 00:24:25,338
This… I'm so lost.

443
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:27,048
-It's a secret. -[sighs] I don't know.

444
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:30,010
Oh.

445
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:36,391
[both chuckling]

446
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:45,317
-[Ji-min] Where are the others? -[Jung-yun] Chatting somewhere.

447
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:53,450
[speaking indistinctly]

448
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:58,455
-[Ji-woo] Whose is this? -Mine.

449
00:25:00,123 --> 00:25:03,168
-[Ji-min] You asked as you put it on. -[Seo-yeong] Mm.

450
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:05,962
Try these two together.

451
00:25:09,507 --> 00:25:12,135
-This yukhoe is really good. -[Ji-woo] Isn't it?

452
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:15,222
Weren't you two the last ones to leave?

453
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:16,181
[chuckles softly]

454
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:19,309
-[Ji-min] Yeah. -But we came back first.

455
00:25:19,392 --> 00:25:21,645
-You guys must have had fun? -[Ji-woo] Mm.

456
00:25:21,728 --> 00:25:23,772
Yeah. Where's Se-yeon?

457
00:25:24,731 --> 00:25:25,732
With Ye-rin.

458
00:25:25,815 --> 00:25:28,318
-It's been a while. -They're talking.

459
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:34,032
Pretty good.

460
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:39,204
[Ji-min] At that moment,

461
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:41,122
I was a little upset.

462
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:43,917
They got closer while I was away.

463
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:47,045
I could tell when I got back.

464
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:50,090
That didn't feel good.

465
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:54,219
[Hee-ji] I'm full. I can't stop though.

466
00:25:59,849 --> 00:26:01,810
Are you keen on anybody?

467
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,646
Keen?

468
00:26:06,147 --> 00:26:07,691
-[chuckles] -Other than me.

469
00:26:07,774 --> 00:26:10,193
[both laugh]

470
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:12,737
-No, I'm not. -No?

471
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:13,822
Not yet anyway.

472
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:17,575
[chuckling] I won't be able to sleep tonight.

473
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:20,161
[both laugh]

474
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:22,289
Oh, it's hot.

475
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:27,794
My cheeks are hot from laughing too hard.

476
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:32,173
My face turns red when I laugh.

477
00:26:34,634 --> 00:26:36,678
-And it hurts here? -Yeah.

478
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:38,847
I get so red it's embarrassing.

479
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:42,058
When I laugh, I get dimples.

480
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:43,768
Those are dimples? Mm.

481
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:47,731
The one on my left cheek is so pronounced.

482
00:26:47,814 --> 00:26:49,649
It looks like a jujube.

483
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:53,778
See for yourself.

484
00:26:58,825 --> 00:27:00,618
-My dad has those. -[laughing]

485
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:02,203
Your dad has the same ones?

486
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:03,496
-[chuckling] Yeah. -Mm.

487
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,915
I wanted his dimples so bad,

488
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:08,251
-I used to poke myself with a chopstick. -Mm.

489
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:09,919
Then my mom would yell at me.

490
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:11,254
[chuckles softly]

491
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:17,177
They're cute though. Dimples are cute.

492
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,432
Come to think of it, all the girls have dimples.

493
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:24,225
I only noticed yours.

494
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:26,686
-[all gasping] -Wow!

495
00:27:27,937 --> 00:27:29,356
Wow, Pyeong-seok.

496
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:32,192
-When he's with Hee-ji-- -He gets to show his real self.

497
00:27:32,275 --> 00:27:35,695
Wow. He's so good at expressing his feelings for someone.

498
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:37,572
They make my head spin.

499
00:27:38,406 --> 00:27:39,616
I only noticed yours.

500
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:42,786
They're pretty noticeable.

501
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,747
[chuckles softly]

502
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:50,627
-I-- -Your eyelashes, they're so long.

503
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:56,966
Seriously. They're that long.

504
00:27:58,259 --> 00:28:00,220
All the guys have long eyelashes.

505
00:28:01,304 --> 00:28:02,972
I only noticed yours.

506
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:05,850
They're so long. [chuckles softly]

507
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:08,061
What is going on?

508
00:28:08,144 --> 00:28:11,147
-[all chuckling] -What's the deal with you two?

509
00:28:12,899 --> 00:28:14,317
Right next to your eye

510
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:16,236
-where you have two moles. -I know.

511
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:20,115
-I wanna draw a mouth under them. -[both chuckle]

512
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:24,577
It's like you have four eyes and they're all staring at me.

513
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:26,371
I used to hate these.

514
00:28:26,454 --> 00:28:27,747
-[Hee-ji] Really? -Yeah.

515
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:29,124
I think they're cute.

516
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:32,627
I used to cover them…

517
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:34,796
[chuckles] …with colored pencils.

518
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:37,298
You colored over them?

519
00:28:39,717 --> 00:28:41,344
When I think about it now…

520
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:46,141
Oh, that's wild. You're funny. When did we get so comfortable?

521
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:48,893
-We are very comfortable, yeah. -Ah.

522
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:53,440
In the beginning, I couldn't even talk to you.

523
00:28:53,523 --> 00:28:56,359
I'd just say, "Uh, okay."

524
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:58,319
"Uh… okay."

525
00:28:58,403 --> 00:28:59,738
You were like this.

526
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:03,575
-That bad? -[both chuckle]

527
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:06,453
You were shy.

528
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:08,455
Super shy.

529
00:29:10,957 --> 00:29:14,627
-I prefer smiling to talking. -[chuckles softly]

530
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:16,671
Maybe it's because of…

531
00:29:17,213 --> 00:29:19,007
my accent.

532
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:20,258
[Hee-ji] Your accent?

533
00:29:20,341 --> 00:29:22,218
Your accent is cute, honestly.

534
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:26,431
I don't know that many people with an accent.

535
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:30,018
First time meeting someone from Daegu?

536
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:32,687
-Yeah. First time. -[Pyeong-seok chuckles softly]

537
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:36,274
This thing is staring at me.

538
00:29:36,357 --> 00:29:39,235
[chuckling softly] It looks like you.

539
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:44,532
If it were you, I'd take it and put it in my pocket.

540
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:46,951
[chuckling] I bet it would fit.

541
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:51,456
-Take it. -I will.

542
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:52,874
Put it in your pocket.

543
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:57,796
-Carry it around with you. -Seriously, I wanna do it.

544
00:30:01,591 --> 00:30:04,177
-I need to become cooler. -Mm? [chuckles]

545
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,804
I need to be cooler.

546
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:07,347
A guy can't be just cute.

547
00:30:08,097 --> 00:30:10,350
Oh, this is bad.

548
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:14,479
I wanna show you I can be a cool dude.

549
00:30:14,562 --> 00:30:15,605
I can't wait.

550
00:30:16,272 --> 00:30:17,273
[sighs]

551
00:30:18,274 --> 00:30:19,484
[Hee-ji] I can't wait.

552
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:23,238
-[exclaiming] Oh! -She wants to put him in her pocket.

553
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:25,824
-Game over. -She must find him really cute.

554
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:28,618
-[Kyuhyun] Sure. -He is cute. He's cute and cool.

555
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:31,746
Why can't they start dating now?

556
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:35,416
I agree. I don't think they're interested in anyone else.

557
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,710
[Su-hyun and Ji-eun] They're not.

558
00:30:39,295 --> 00:30:41,798
-[Ye-rin] I asked to talk to him. -[Jung-yun] Yeah?

559
00:30:41,881 --> 00:30:44,092
-[Ye-rin] It was a little weird. -I bet.

560
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:47,011
-What did you talk about? -With Se-yeon?

561
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:48,096
Mm…

562
00:30:48,763 --> 00:30:50,723
We talked about who we're attracted to.

563
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:53,351
Oh… Did you tell him he's your favorite?

564
00:30:54,477 --> 00:30:55,895
-Se-yeon? -Yeah.

565
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:57,939
-I did. -You told him?

566
00:30:58,022 --> 00:31:01,192
I said he'd been my number-one guy…

567
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,611
ever since the library.

568
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:07,574
But we both worry about limiting ourselves.

569
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:12,036
If we're always with each other then that's it.

570
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:15,206
There's no room for anyone else.

571
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:17,917
It's not like we're in a relationship already.

572
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:20,044
-Yeah, you're not. -There's no love.

573
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:24,048
I just find our time together stimulating, that's all.

574
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:25,925
-Right. -It's not love.

575
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:28,970
I get it.

576
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:34,475
But I'm open to things changing obviously.

577
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:38,980
I'd like to get to know everyone. I just want to have fun.

578
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:41,566
-[Jung-yun] Of course. -It's not like I'm flirting.

579
00:31:41,649 --> 00:31:44,485
It's more like, "Hey, let's hang out together."

580
00:31:45,987 --> 00:31:48,031
That's the right attitude. For now.

581
00:31:48,531 --> 00:31:51,492
-That way I won't have any regrets. -[Jung-yun] Very true.

582
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:53,202
You're still going out tomorrow?

583
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:56,789
Yeah, but I don't know who with. I need to figure it out.

584
00:31:59,542 --> 00:32:01,377
-Hey, wanna talk? -What?

585
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:03,129
-Wanna join us? -[Ji-min] Sure.

586
00:32:03,212 --> 00:32:05,214
-What were you talking about? -[Jung-yun] Us?

587
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:07,967
-About… a bunch of things. -[Jung-yun] Who we're attracted to.

588
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:10,595
Yeah, who we're attracted to.

589
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:14,349
-What about you? -Me?

590
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:16,893
Yeah, I don't know where you're at.

591
00:32:16,976 --> 00:32:20,355
Right now, my goal is simple. Mm…

592
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:23,399
I just wanna drink and party.

593
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:26,611
[Se-woon] Oh, man. Can't say it in front of Jung-yun.

594
00:32:26,694 --> 00:32:28,363
Of course, of course.

595
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:29,781
-He can't say it. -Duh.

596
00:32:29,864 --> 00:32:32,325
I just wanna drink and party.

597
00:32:32,408 --> 00:32:33,868
Mm…

598
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:36,371
I wanna have fun.

599
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:40,917
-You might find someone that way. -No, wait. This is sad.

600
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,087
It's making me sad. I'm not even sure why.

601
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:47,215
Oh, Ji-min, why is this so sad?

602
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:49,550
Can't Ji-min just tell Jung-yun?

603
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:51,511
"I like Ji-woo"?

604
00:32:52,011 --> 00:32:53,930
-Yeah. -I don't think so.

605
00:32:54,013 --> 00:32:55,598
-It's tricky. -It is.

606
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:58,226
Ji-min needs to be straightforward

607
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:01,479
-and express his true feelings. -[Su-hyun] Mm-hmm.

608
00:33:01,562 --> 00:33:03,898
Right now he's not saying anything about anyone.

609
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:04,816
[Su-hyun] Right.

610
00:33:04,899 --> 00:33:07,443
-I bet Ji-woo doesn't even know… -Ji-woo doesn't know.

611
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:09,696
-…that Ji-min likes her. -[Ji-eun] She doesn't know.

612
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:12,407
Now…

613
00:33:13,199 --> 00:33:14,283
Hey, girl.

614
00:33:14,367 --> 00:33:15,785
-Have a seat. -Yeah.

615
00:33:16,619 --> 00:33:17,578
Sure.

616
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:19,288
-Uh… -[Ji-min] What's wrong?

617
00:33:19,372 --> 00:33:20,373
Nothing.

618
00:33:20,456 --> 00:33:22,709
-[Ji-min] Why so serious? -I… I just…

619
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:25,545
I'm not sure what's going on.

620
00:33:25,628 --> 00:33:27,964
It's like she's with him, he's with her.

621
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:31,300
Why can't we let things evolve?

622
00:33:33,594 --> 00:33:36,514
As long as we're in this house, I wanna stay open.

623
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:41,060
I'll date everyone and get to really know them.

624
00:33:41,936 --> 00:33:43,062
We're all complex.

625
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:44,897
-That's true. -[Seo-yeong] We are.

626
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:46,983
-Proud of me? -[Ji-min] Yeah.

627
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:48,443
You're proud?

628
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:50,778
Here's your pat on the back.

629
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:54,157
-I was proud of you. -[Ye-rin] Air pat on the back?

630
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,783
-[chuckles] -Exactly.

631
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:58,286
So you all know who my crush is?

632
00:33:58,369 --> 00:34:00,079
-[Ye-rin] You mean Ji-woo? -Yes.

633
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:03,082
-Of course, everyone knows. -Well, yeah. It's so obvious.

634
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:05,918
Guess it is.

635
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:08,504
You're always staring at her.

636
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:10,506
Can't help myself.

637
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:13,760
-[chuckles] -[Jung-yun] Should I be more coy?

638
00:34:13,843 --> 00:34:16,471
-No, no. Say how you feel. -[Jung-yun] Okay.

639
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:18,848
-[Ye-rin] You can say it. -[Jung-yun] It's hard.

640
00:34:21,809 --> 00:34:25,938
I have a question. What if you leave this house without dating any one?

641
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:29,525
I think about that too sometimes.

642
00:34:30,526 --> 00:34:33,029
-[Seo-yeong] Mm. -[Ye-rin] Now I'm having fun on my own.

643
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:36,908
But maybe when I leave, I'll be like, "I'm leaving this house alone."

644
00:34:36,991 --> 00:34:40,787
"Does any… Does any candidate want to couple up with Choi Ye-rin?"

645
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:42,288
-"One, two…" -[both] "Three!"

646
00:34:42,371 --> 00:34:45,208
"Nobody! Sorry. You're eliminated."

647
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:46,209
"Goodbye."

648
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:49,837
Oh wow, Ji-min, you're so funny.

649
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:51,089
Ji-min is funny.

650
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:54,258
-Wanna have dinner with me tomorrow? -Dinner?

651
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:55,510
-[Ye-rin] Yeah. -You and me?

652
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:58,513
-[Ye-rin] Dinner. What do you like? -Gukbap, of course.

653
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:01,182
-Gukbap? -[Ji-min] I'm kidding.

654
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:04,393
-I can see us eating Gukbap. -Yeah?

655
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:08,022
[Ye-rin] That'd be hilarious.

656
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:10,775
These two are going to become close friends.

657
00:35:10,858 --> 00:35:12,735
Mm. Well, you never know.

658
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:14,320
-True. -[Se-woon] You can't.

659
00:35:14,403 --> 00:35:15,988
Especially at that age.

660
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:18,366
[Sang-won] Oh, we ate the entire thing.

661
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:20,451
-[Seo-hyeon chuckling] Yeah. -Let's go.

662
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:23,121
Oh, wait a second. Here.

663
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:26,290
-You're good. -Thank you.

664
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:30,837
-I'm full. -Me too.

665
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:33,256
I could fall asleep right here.

666
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:36,384
-Oh, that was fun. -Yeah.

667
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:38,427
-Was it? -The food was great.

668
00:35:38,511 --> 00:35:41,430
-But was it fun? -[chuckling] Yes, I had a lot of fun.

669
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:42,557
I swear.

670
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,724
It was fun.

671
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:45,810
So, the most important thing on a date…

672
00:35:45,893 --> 00:35:47,478
-Stop! [giggles] -…is good food?

673
00:35:48,229 --> 00:35:50,565
-Good food, good date? -[both laugh]

674
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:54,527
No, no, no. I really enjoyed our conversation.

675
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:00,783
I've got something for you.

676
00:36:02,076 --> 00:36:03,077
A gift.

677
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:05,621
-What? -Huh?

678
00:36:05,705 --> 00:36:07,165
Should I be excited?

679
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:10,918
[chuckles nervously] I dropped a hint earlier today.

680
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:12,044
You did?

681
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:14,630
I'll give it later.

682
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:19,051
-[Seo-hyeon] I'm so… -[Sang-won] Where are the others?

683
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:21,470
-[Seo-hyeon] I don't see them. -Probably downstairs.

684
00:36:21,554 --> 00:36:22,680
[Seo-hyeon] Oh.

685
00:36:22,763 --> 00:36:25,516
Or are we the first ones back? I don't like that.

686
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:28,394
Me neither. Should we go back out?

687
00:36:28,477 --> 00:36:30,479
Should we leave? Look up.

688
00:36:31,772 --> 00:36:33,649
-Mind looking up? -Sure.

689
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:37,153
-Over there. You see those three stars? -Mm-hmm.

690
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:40,448
Those are the three stars of Orion's belt.

691
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:43,618
-[Seo-hyeon] Those three stars? -[Sang-won] Yeah.

692
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:45,661
-[Seo-hyeon] Oh, okay. -Orion's belt.

693
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:47,622
-Wow, they're so bright. -Yeah.

694
00:36:48,497 --> 00:36:50,791
Cold? Let's go inside.

695
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,919
[Seo-hyeon] Yes, please.

696
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:55,463
You know, you're pretty cool.

697
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:57,340
-[Sang-won] I'm pretty cool? -Yeah.

698
00:36:57,423 --> 00:36:59,133
-[Sang-won] Thank you. -Whoa.

699
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:02,261
-[Sang-won] Daddy's home! -[both laugh]

700
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:04,889
-What if no one's here? -[Sang-won] Maybe they're still out.

701
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:07,683
-Yeah? -Mm-hmm.

702
00:37:08,517 --> 00:37:10,603
-What about in here? -That can work.

703
00:37:10,686 --> 00:37:12,647
[gasping] I haven't been in here yet!

704
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:14,815
-Let's talk here. -First time for you too?

705
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:15,733
[Se-yeon] Yeah.

706
00:37:18,027 --> 00:37:18,945
This is huge.

707
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:20,696
[laughing]

708
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,865
-I'm so excited. -[Kyuhyun] Me too.

709
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:27,203
What did you two talk about?

710
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:29,080
A lot of things.

711
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:32,333
-That's why it took so long. -Mm.

712
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:34,126
Uh…

713
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:36,712
This might take a while.

714
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:38,339
-Is that okay? -[Ji-woo] It's okay.

715
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:40,049
-I… -Mm-hmm.

716
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:43,261
Who do you think

717
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:45,638
I like the most right now?

718
00:37:46,472 --> 00:37:48,683
-Ye-rin. -How do you feel about that?

719
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:53,020
Well, Ye-rin and I are friends and I know how she feels about you.

720
00:37:53,729 --> 00:37:55,898
-[Se-yeon] Right. -So, mm…

721
00:37:55,982 --> 00:38:00,236
I think that you two would be a good pair. Mm.

722
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:03,447
[Se-yeon] Hm.

723
00:38:04,865 --> 00:38:08,286
Ye-rin and I… We hung out a lot before you arrived.

724
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:12,248
We spent a lot of time, just the two of us.

725
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:17,461
And I've come to realize how amazing she is.

726
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:18,796
But…

727
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:22,341
I'm not sure how I feel right now.

728
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:23,634
[Ji-woo] You're not?

729
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:27,263
You must have at least a preference?

730
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:33,644
You.

731
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:35,313
[all gasping]

732
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:36,772
[Ji-eun] Oh, my God!

733
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:39,317
[laughing] Oh! oh!

734
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:41,569
-[gasps] -[Ji-eun] Wow!

735
00:38:42,069 --> 00:38:43,237
[Kyuhyun] It's insane.

736
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:48,367
You.

737
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:49,994
Hm?

738
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:53,164
[chuckles nervously] Well…

739
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:56,751
When I first saw you, I thought…

740
00:38:57,543 --> 00:38:59,462
she's gonna be a hard nut to crack.

741
00:39:00,379 --> 00:39:02,089
Because you seemed so shy.

742
00:39:03,132 --> 00:39:04,884
I didn't know how to approach you.

743
00:39:05,551 --> 00:39:09,347
But then at the table tennis club, it was just the two of us.

744
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:12,641
And I guess we were both feeling awkward

745
00:39:12,725 --> 00:39:14,518
so we started goofing around.

746
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:17,438
-[Ji-woo] It was so awkward. -[Se-yeon] It was at first.

747
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:20,691
But then, being around you,

748
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:23,152
-I… -We had fun.

749
00:39:23,235 --> 00:39:25,112
Yeah, we had fun. A lot of fun.

750
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:28,115
So I was hooked.

751
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:33,829
Then we ended up partners in dance class.

752
00:39:33,913 --> 00:39:35,414
-We danced together. -That was great.

753
00:39:37,249 --> 00:39:39,293
Maybe I'm the only one who felt it,

754
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:42,421
but when we were holding hands…

755
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:48,386
uh… It was like we couldn't let go.

756
00:39:50,846 --> 00:39:52,515
We were supposed to switch.

757
00:39:54,975 --> 00:39:57,812
But it felt like neither of us wanted to.

758
00:39:58,646 --> 00:39:59,814
Maybe I'm imagining it.

759
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:03,943
I know I didn't want to let go.

760
00:40:05,027 --> 00:40:06,404
[giggling] Really?

761
00:40:07,738 --> 00:40:08,864
I was enjoying it.

762
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:12,118
I was enjoying it too much to let your hand go.

763
00:40:14,036 --> 00:40:16,789
But maybe my feelings for you are not reciprocated,

764
00:40:16,872 --> 00:40:19,291
-and if that's the case, I'm sorry. -No, I…

765
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:21,627
It was… very romantic.

766
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:27,925
-You thought so? -[Ji-woo] Yeah.

767
00:40:28,008 --> 00:40:29,468
It's started…

768
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:33,556
-I felt it too. You could have let go. -[Se-yeon] Right.

769
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:37,435
But we kept holding on. Mm.

770
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:47,111
If it weren't for that dance class,

771
00:40:48,195 --> 00:40:50,781
maybe we would have never had a real talk like this.

772
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:53,617
Yeah, that was our chance.

773
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:58,205
That did it for me. That and the table tennis.

774
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:03,461
I didn't know you felt this way.

775
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:09,008
-I thought you just saw me as a friend. -Hm.

776
00:41:09,091 --> 00:41:12,636
When we were talking during lunch, I felt something.

777
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:15,806
I wasn't sure what it was.

778
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:17,766
Now I know I wasn't crazy.

779
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:21,479
May I ask about you and Jung-yun?

780
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:24,607
How do you feel about him?

781
00:41:26,525 --> 00:41:28,444
-Jung-yun and I-- -[Se-yeon] Yeah.

782
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:40,498
They're taking forever.

783
00:41:45,669 --> 00:41:46,837
[chuckling] Nervous?

784
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:58,641
-At first, Jung-yun, seemed pretty cold. -[Se-yeon] Yeah.

785
00:41:59,725 --> 00:42:01,685
But when we got to Wolmido

786
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:05,773
we ended up next to one another and we got to talk.

787
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:08,275
So he was the first one I connected with.

788
00:42:09,235 --> 00:42:12,154
But then we kept walking,

789
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:16,033
and I lost both of you at the Ferris wheel.

790
00:42:16,116 --> 00:42:18,536
So I wasn't sure who would pick me.

791
00:42:19,495 --> 00:42:23,374
Sure enough, nobody did. Then Ye-rin picked you.

792
00:42:24,416 --> 00:42:26,293
So I ended up with Jung-yun.

793
00:42:27,253 --> 00:42:31,006
In the car, I realized he had feelings for me.

794
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:32,967
You didn't even know

795
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:35,511
-there were new students, right? -I didn't know.

796
00:42:35,594 --> 00:42:38,305
-Well how did you feel when I got here? -I was a bit excited.

797
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:40,432
-What? -I was excited about getting new students.

798
00:42:40,516 --> 00:42:41,850
-[Ji-woo] Really? -Yeah.

799
00:42:42,768 --> 00:42:44,061
That's good enough.

800
00:42:46,146 --> 00:42:49,066
I got really close to Jung-yun on the Ferris wheel.

801
00:42:49,149 --> 00:42:53,070
That ride broke the ice. After that I got comfortable around him.

802
00:42:56,490 --> 00:42:58,075
Yeah. I noticed that yesterday.

803
00:42:59,368 --> 00:43:01,328
When I saw you and Jung-yun together,

804
00:43:02,162 --> 00:43:04,915
-the two of you were talking and flirting. -Mm.

805
00:43:06,041 --> 00:43:07,042
I was

806
00:43:08,544 --> 00:43:09,545
pretty upset.

807
00:43:12,214 --> 00:43:14,049
Yeah, it didn't sit well with me.

808
00:43:15,634 --> 00:43:18,220
I wouldn't feel that way if I didn't care about you,

809
00:43:18,304 --> 00:43:20,180
if I didn't have feelings for you.

810
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:25,728
Maybe you like Jung-yun because he expressed his feelings for you.

811
00:43:27,062 --> 00:43:28,188
He did it first.

812
00:43:29,565 --> 00:43:32,610
Might be too late, but I wanted you to know…

813
00:43:33,485 --> 00:43:34,737
-[Ji-woo] Mm-hmm. -…that

814
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:38,991
I also… have feelings for you.

815
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:42,453
That I like you.

816
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:44,788
Mm.

817
00:43:46,165 --> 00:43:49,168
I had no idea. It was such a shock.

818
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:53,797
-[Se-yeon] A good one? -Oh, yes. It's good. Let's go on a date.

819
00:43:58,969 --> 00:44:00,721
How about the day after tomorrow?

820
00:44:01,764 --> 00:44:04,725
-Day after tomorrow? -Tomorrow I'm with Jung-yun.

821
00:44:04,808 --> 00:44:07,061
[both laughing]

822
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:09,980
So how about it?

823
00:44:12,441 --> 00:44:14,485
Let's go on a date the day after tomorrow.

824
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:22,451
Why did you have to arrive after everyone else and rock my world like that?

825
00:44:23,952 --> 00:44:25,746
I am grateful, though.

826
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:29,291
You were really cool just now.

827
00:44:29,875 --> 00:44:31,669
I just told you how I really felt.

828
00:44:32,836 --> 00:44:33,837
[Ji-woo] Yeah.

829
00:44:34,963 --> 00:44:37,091
[Se-yeon] We've been talking a long time.

830
00:44:38,175 --> 00:44:40,928
[chuckles softly] I like what's happening right now.

831
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:44,181
It's like at the dance class.

832
00:44:45,265 --> 00:44:47,601
-Should we let go? -[Ji-woo] Probably.

833
00:44:48,727 --> 00:44:51,647
-Should we let go now? All right. -[Ji-woo] Yeah. Let's go.

834
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:58,112
-[all gasp] -[Kyuhyun] Huh?

835
00:44:58,195 --> 00:45:00,572
What's going on? Are they dating?

836
00:45:00,656 --> 00:45:03,409
-[Se-woon exclaims] -I can't believe what I just saw.

837
00:45:03,492 --> 00:45:05,619
Se-yeon was so honest about his feelings.

838
00:45:05,702 --> 00:45:06,745
Honesty is cool.

839
00:45:06,829 --> 00:45:09,206
[Su-hyun] Oh, how are you so cool, Se-yeon?

840
00:45:09,289 --> 00:45:11,750
I thought Ji-woo's feelings were set in stone.

841
00:45:11,834 --> 00:45:13,836
More like set in sand.

842
00:45:13,919 --> 00:45:15,838
-Exactly. More like in sand. -It was just sand.

843
00:45:15,921 --> 00:45:17,256
It was just sand. Wow.

844
00:45:17,339 --> 00:45:21,427
From the start, Ji-woo said that she was interested in both Se-yeon and Jung-yun.

845
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:23,846
Even though she thought Se-yeon didn't care.

846
00:45:23,929 --> 00:45:25,013
[Se-woon] Yeah.

847
00:45:25,097 --> 00:45:27,015
She is very happy right now,

848
00:45:27,099 --> 00:45:29,685
but I bet she's also pretty confused.

849
00:45:29,768 --> 00:45:32,771
It's the first time that we've seen her flustered.

850
00:45:32,855 --> 00:45:36,316
In a way, Ji-woo made the first move when she started talking to Jung-yun.

851
00:45:37,818 --> 00:45:40,320
But Se-yeon waited, he asked her out

852
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:42,448
when she least expected it.

853
00:45:42,531 --> 00:45:45,200
Ji-woo has probably warmed up to Se-yeon

854
00:45:45,284 --> 00:45:47,327
now that he's declared his affection.

855
00:45:48,036 --> 00:45:50,581
How could she not after he poured his heart out?

856
00:45:51,457 --> 00:45:53,250
Wow. Things are moving fast.

857
00:45:54,543 --> 00:45:56,879
[Hee-ji and Pyeong-seok giggling]

858
00:45:56,962 --> 00:45:59,590
[Hee-ji] I wonder what the others are up to.

859
00:45:59,673 --> 00:46:00,591
Drinking.

860
00:46:01,717 --> 00:46:04,344
Yeah, I bet they're drinking.

861
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:05,262
Probably.

862
00:46:06,388 --> 00:46:07,848
I had a lot of fun.

863
00:46:10,893 --> 00:46:11,977
Fist bump?

864
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:14,938
[chuckles]

865
00:46:16,106 --> 00:46:18,484
I don't think I know how to make a proper fist.

866
00:46:19,234 --> 00:46:20,068
[giggles]

867
00:46:22,529 --> 00:46:24,156
Yeah, that's not how you do it.

868
00:46:25,824 --> 00:46:27,993
-Squeeze. -Like this?

869
00:46:28,076 --> 00:46:29,286
Make a fist.

870
00:46:31,705 --> 00:46:33,373
-Relax here. -Okay.

871
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:36,210
-Curl your hand. Yeah, like this. -Curl it.

872
00:46:37,461 --> 00:46:38,962
-Like this? -Do it like this.

873
00:46:39,505 --> 00:46:40,506
Like this.

874
00:46:42,841 --> 00:46:44,426
-Like this. -Like this.

875
00:46:45,802 --> 00:46:47,638
Remember to relax this part.

876
00:46:47,721 --> 00:46:49,515
Mm.

877
00:46:50,807 --> 00:46:53,393
-I used to do it like this. -Most people do.

878
00:46:54,102 --> 00:46:55,270
Oh!

879
00:46:55,354 --> 00:46:56,772
-Like this. -This is so cool.

880
00:46:56,855 --> 00:46:58,899
It should look like a straight line.

881
00:46:58,982 --> 00:47:01,777
-Like this? -Yeah, that way you don't hurt your hand.

882
00:47:05,906 --> 00:47:07,449
[both chuckle]

883
00:47:11,912 --> 00:47:12,746
Like this.

884
00:47:13,956 --> 00:47:15,249
Now I know.

885
00:47:17,918 --> 00:47:21,129
[indistinct chatter, laughter]

886
00:47:24,049 --> 00:47:26,593
[Sang-won] You're back! What were you guys up to?

887
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:34,309
[indistinct chatter]

888
00:47:37,604 --> 00:47:39,523
[indistinct conversation continues]

889
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:46,947
I was sitting there wondering why they were taking so long.

890
00:47:47,906 --> 00:47:50,784
I was kind of… at a loss.

891
00:47:51,785 --> 00:47:54,162
Look who's waiting for the outcome.

892
00:47:54,246 --> 00:47:55,914
Ye-rin, Ji-min and Jung-yun.

893
00:47:55,998 --> 00:47:58,417
-They're all involved. -They are.

894
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:00,836
[chuckling] And the guys share a room.

895
00:48:00,919 --> 00:48:01,837
Oh!

896
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,922
[Ji-eun] I've never seen Jung-yun like that.

897
00:48:04,006 --> 00:48:06,091
-How's that gonna work? -[Su-hyun] This is bad.

898
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,552
Earl grey, right?

899
00:48:09,678 --> 00:48:10,804
Earl grey.

900
00:48:10,887 --> 00:48:12,556
-Earl grey highball… -Wanna go outside?

901
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:14,725
-…then Suntory whiskey. -Let's go, buddy.

902
00:48:14,808 --> 00:48:17,561
-Then… -Won't you get cold?

903
00:48:17,644 --> 00:48:19,354
Nah, let me know if you do.

904
00:48:23,108 --> 00:48:24,818
[inhales deeply and exhales]

905
00:48:27,404 --> 00:48:28,363
[sighs]

906
00:48:30,324 --> 00:48:32,826
I didn't expect things to turn out this way.

907
00:48:32,909 --> 00:48:33,827
What way?

908
00:48:36,163 --> 00:48:38,290
When we talked about our first impressions

909
00:48:39,291 --> 00:48:40,709
you were like,

910
00:48:40,792 --> 00:48:42,711
"I just want to get to know everyone."

911
00:48:42,794 --> 00:48:45,422
-That was before Ji-woo arrived. -That's right.

912
00:48:46,006 --> 00:48:49,009
And when she did, you were obviously smitten.

913
00:48:49,092 --> 00:48:51,219
Yeah. I can tell you liked her.

914
00:48:52,846 --> 00:48:53,930
Anyways…

915
00:48:55,515 --> 00:48:57,768
I know you like Ji-woo a lot.

916
00:48:59,186 --> 00:49:02,105
Yet, I can't just give up on her.

917
00:49:02,189 --> 00:49:04,274
-No, you shouldn't. -I can't.

918
00:49:05,984 --> 00:49:06,943
I thought I…

919
00:49:07,736 --> 00:49:10,864
I thought I should tell her how I feel, regardless of how you feel.

920
00:49:10,947 --> 00:49:13,200
Right. Those are two separate things.

921
00:49:16,411 --> 00:49:17,537
[sighs]

922
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:20,791
That said…

923
00:49:23,085 --> 00:49:26,046
I don't want our friendship to suffer because of Ji-woo.

924
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:28,632
-Me neither. -We don't know what will happen.

925
00:49:29,841 --> 00:49:30,967
Don't worry about it.

926
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:33,053
-[Se-yeon] I'll try. -Just be honest.

927
00:49:34,137 --> 00:49:36,807
Yeah, that's why I'm telling you how I feel right now.

928
00:49:38,392 --> 00:49:40,894
I guess I needed some liquid courage.

929
00:49:48,276 --> 00:49:49,319
I'm so thirsty.

930
00:49:50,946 --> 00:49:52,072
[exhales]

931
00:49:54,449 --> 00:49:55,492
This is so…

932
00:49:56,702 --> 00:49:58,995
[Se-yeon] After my talk with Jung-yun,

933
00:49:59,079 --> 00:50:00,789
I felt a lot, lot better.

934
00:50:00,872 --> 00:50:01,748
SE-YEON

935
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:05,168
Jung-yun was very understanding about the whole thing.

936
00:50:05,877 --> 00:50:07,045
As I expected.

937
00:50:08,463 --> 00:50:10,006
Still, I was relieved.

938
00:50:11,758 --> 00:50:14,428
That's when I realized how Se-yeon really felt.

939
00:50:14,511 --> 00:50:15,762
JUNG-YUN

940
00:50:16,722 --> 00:50:18,223
That was very cool of him,

941
00:50:19,182 --> 00:50:20,642
opening up to me like he did.

942
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:24,938
But I have no intention of letting him win.

943
00:50:28,692 --> 00:50:29,860
Do you have a sec?

944
00:50:29,943 --> 00:50:30,777
Sure.

945
00:50:33,697 --> 00:50:34,990
Any idea what it is?

946
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:37,784
-No, I've been wondering. -Oh, yeah?

947
00:50:38,785 --> 00:50:40,245
It made me think of you.

948
00:50:40,328 --> 00:50:41,663
DIAMOND PAINTING

949
00:50:42,414 --> 00:50:44,583
-Oh! -Like, it had your name on it.

950
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:46,168
Whoa.

951
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:48,503
I forgot mine.

952
00:50:48,587 --> 00:50:49,463
That's your gift.

953
00:50:54,092 --> 00:50:55,302
I'm really touched.

954
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:01,475
-Let me know if you wanna do it together. -I do!

955
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:02,559
Great.

956
00:51:02,642 --> 00:51:03,727
Maybe tomorrow then?

957
00:51:04,644 --> 00:51:05,520
Awesome!

958
00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:08,148
-Thank you. -[Sang-won] Did I nail it?

959
00:51:08,231 --> 00:51:09,608
-Oh, yeah. -[Sang-won] Cool.

960
00:51:09,691 --> 00:51:11,651
[Seo-hyeon] I missed my cross stitch.

961
00:51:12,235 --> 00:51:14,196
[Ji-woo] Easy, easy. No Easy.

962
00:51:14,279 --> 00:51:16,239
-[Hee-ji] How did it go? -[Ji-woo] Good.

963
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:17,783
-[Hee-ji] Se-yeon? -Se-yeon.

964
00:51:17,866 --> 00:51:19,951
-Didn't see that coming. -Me neither.

965
00:51:20,035 --> 00:51:21,203
It was unexpected.

966
00:51:21,286 --> 00:51:23,914
-I wonder what he told you. -Oh, he surprised me.

967
00:51:23,997 --> 00:51:26,750
-Where do you want to sit? -I never imagined-- Here's fine.

968
00:51:29,586 --> 00:51:32,297
[Ji-woo] I really had zero idea.

969
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:34,174
He asked to talk to you?

970
00:51:34,257 --> 00:51:37,219
Yeah, it was just the four of us left, so.

971
00:51:37,302 --> 00:51:39,179
We decided to pair up and talk.

972
00:51:40,388 --> 00:51:41,640
Can we sit?

973
00:51:42,307 --> 00:51:43,225
[Seo-hyeon] Sure.

974
00:51:45,143 --> 00:51:47,646
-[Se-yeon] What time is it? -[Pyeong-seok] 11:59.

975
00:51:47,729 --> 00:51:49,147
[Se-yeon] One minute left.

976
00:51:49,231 --> 00:51:50,106
[all gasp]

977
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:52,651
-[Ji-woo] Wow, it's out! -[Sang-won] The dream dates.

978
00:51:53,527 --> 00:51:56,655
[Hee-ji] "Every day at midnight, dream dates will be revealed."

979
00:51:56,738 --> 00:51:58,824
[Sang-won] "Only one dream date ticket per person."

980
00:51:58,907 --> 00:52:01,451
You need to save it if you can only use it once.

981
00:52:01,535 --> 00:52:03,662
Saving it may not be the best strategy.

982
00:52:03,745 --> 00:52:05,997
Wow. I wonder what the dream dates are?

983
00:52:07,499 --> 00:52:10,418
-I'm really curious too. -Best dream date…

984
00:52:11,253 --> 00:52:13,338
-Theme park? -That could be it.

985
00:52:13,421 --> 00:52:15,006
-Skating. -Oh, skating.

986
00:52:15,632 --> 00:52:17,133
Maybe a little getaway trip?

987
00:52:17,217 --> 00:52:18,802
-What? -[Seo-hyeon] A trip?

988
00:52:18,885 --> 00:52:21,805
[Se-yeon] Yeah, like overnight. I think it's possible.

989
00:52:21,888 --> 00:52:23,014
I want to go camping.

990
00:52:23,098 --> 00:52:25,851
-[Ye-rin] Camping would be nice. -I like camping.

991
00:52:25,934 --> 00:52:27,269
[Ji-woo] That's awesome.

992
00:52:27,352 --> 00:52:29,771
As a good daughter, I can't do an overnight date.

993
00:52:29,855 --> 00:52:33,400
If it's first come, first serve, can't I just go and write my name down?

994
00:52:33,483 --> 00:52:34,985
No, someone has to agree first.

995
00:52:35,777 --> 00:52:38,405
-[Se-yeon] You have to reach an agreement. -Oh, okay.

996
00:52:38,488 --> 00:52:39,823
[Ji-woo] What time is it?

997
00:52:39,906 --> 00:52:41,157
[Jung-yun] Almost midnight.

998
00:52:41,241 --> 00:52:43,034
-[Seo-hyeon] Midnight. -[Sang-won] Oh!

999
00:52:45,078 --> 00:52:46,204
-[gasps] -[beeps]

1000
00:52:46,288 --> 00:52:48,081
[all exclaiming]

1001
00:52:48,164 --> 00:52:50,292
[all cheering]

1002
00:52:52,961 --> 00:52:54,796
-What? What? -What?

1003
00:52:55,422 --> 00:52:56,423
It's that amazing?

1004
00:52:56,506 --> 00:52:58,258
-What is it? -[Ji-eun] What is it?

1005
00:52:59,175 --> 00:53:00,176
[Jung-yun exclaims]

1006
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:02,596
[all exclaiming, cheering]

1007
00:53:03,096 --> 00:53:05,932
DREAM DATES: FULL RENTAL OF LOTTE WORLD ADVENTURE, STARGAZING

1008
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:07,934
STARGAZING

1009
00:53:08,018 --> 00:53:13,148
FULL RENTAL OF LOTTE WORLD ADVENTURE

1010
00:53:13,732 --> 00:53:16,234
-Wow! Look. -[Se-woon] The whole place.

1011
00:53:16,902 --> 00:53:18,862
-All to yourself. -[Su-hyun] All to yourself.

1012
00:53:18,945 --> 00:53:20,906
-I've never done that. -[Ji-eun] None of us have.

1013
00:53:20,989 --> 00:53:23,408
-I want to do it too. -I'll probably never get to do it.

1014
00:53:23,491 --> 00:53:25,869
-[Se-woon] That's so cool. -I wish I could do that.

1015
00:53:25,952 --> 00:53:28,538
-Wow, it really is a dream date. -[Ji-eun] I want one, too.

1016
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:32,167
-[Seo-hyeon] Yes! -Me! Me, me, me, me!

1017
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:33,877
[Seo-hyeon] Lotte World Adventure!

1018
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:35,712
Definitely Lotte World Adventure.

1019
00:53:36,379 --> 00:53:37,797
[Ji-woo exclaiming]

1020
00:53:37,881 --> 00:53:39,007
[laughing]

1021
00:53:39,633 --> 00:53:40,884
-Ji-woo… -This is amazing.

1022
00:53:40,967 --> 00:53:43,011
-Lotte World Adventure. -[Sang-won] So cool.

1023
00:53:43,678 --> 00:53:47,432
A bunch of us predicted that the date would be at a theme park,

1024
00:53:48,683 --> 00:53:52,145
but none of us imagined having the place to ourselves.

1025
00:53:53,396 --> 00:53:56,024
That's a once in a lifetime opportunity.

1026
00:53:56,816 --> 00:53:58,318
At first, I thought I misread.

1027
00:53:58,401 --> 00:53:59,277
SE-YEON

1028
00:53:59,986 --> 00:54:02,238
Wow, this really is a dream date.

1029
00:54:02,322 --> 00:54:03,198
SANG-WON

1030
00:54:03,281 --> 00:54:06,701
I was like, "Lotte World Adventure? Just the two of us?"

1031
00:54:07,535 --> 00:54:09,162
I really, really wanna go.

1032
00:54:09,746 --> 00:54:11,206
Should we use our tickets?

1033
00:54:11,289 --> 00:54:12,916
-Wanna go? -[Seo-hyeon] For real?

1034
00:54:12,999 --> 00:54:15,001
-[Ji-woo] This is awesome. -It's okay with you?

1035
00:54:15,627 --> 00:54:18,296
-[Ye-rin] Who's going with me? -First come, first served.

1036
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:20,256
-[Ye-rin] Wait! -Write it! Write it!

1037
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:21,883
[Jung-yun] What are you doing?

1038
00:54:23,343 --> 00:54:25,637
Wow, this is no fun. I'm going home.

1039
00:54:26,554 --> 00:54:28,223
Why don't you go stargazing?

1040
00:54:28,807 --> 00:54:30,183
Want me to erase it?

1041
00:54:30,266 --> 00:54:31,184
[Ji-woo] Yes.

1042
00:54:31,851 --> 00:54:33,561
Please erase it.

1043
00:54:34,104 --> 00:54:35,480
Did you reach an agreement?

1044
00:54:35,563 --> 00:54:36,439
We did.

1045
00:54:36,523 --> 00:54:38,441
-Yeah, we did. -[Sang-won] Half a second.

1046
00:54:38,525 --> 00:54:40,443
-We were super-fast. -[Se-yeon] Well, then…

1047
00:54:40,527 --> 00:54:42,612
Does that look like Sang-won or Jung-yun?

1048
00:54:42,696 --> 00:54:44,155
[Sang-won] It looks like Jung-won.

1049
00:54:44,239 --> 00:54:45,865
[Seo-hyeon] More like Sang-yun.

1050
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:47,242
Whose name do you see?

1051
00:54:47,325 --> 00:54:51,162
[Sang-won] Jung Sang-won-yun. Jung Sang-won-yun.

1052
00:54:51,246 --> 00:54:52,497
What a nightmare.

1053
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:57,293
I'll never get the chance to have Lotte World to myself.

1054
00:54:57,377 --> 00:54:58,294
JUNG-YUN

1055
00:54:58,378 --> 00:54:59,629
It would be a dream date.

1056
00:55:00,755 --> 00:55:03,258
And obviously, I wanted to bring Ji-woo with me.

1057
00:55:04,884 --> 00:55:06,469
That's why I was so passionate.

1058
00:55:07,429 --> 00:55:09,264
Ugh, he beat me to it.

1059
00:55:10,557 --> 00:55:11,599
[exhales]

1060
00:55:16,646 --> 00:55:18,189
I guess I'll write my name on it.

1061
00:55:19,024 --> 00:55:21,985
If anyone else is interested, we could shoot for it.

1062
00:55:22,068 --> 00:55:24,195
-Should we? -If you want to.

1063
00:55:24,279 --> 00:55:26,281
[Sang-won] You need a partner to agree first.

1064
00:55:26,364 --> 00:55:27,574
I'll do it.

1065
00:55:28,491 --> 00:55:30,994
You need to find a date first and get her to agree.

1066
00:55:31,077 --> 00:55:33,163
-Yeah, find a date. -He found one!

1067
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:35,373
-We're going on a date! -I want to go!

1068
00:55:35,457 --> 00:55:37,292
Find yourself a date then, Jung-yun.

1069
00:55:37,375 --> 00:55:40,128
-Us singles are going together. -Let's cheer for it.

1070
00:55:41,087 --> 00:55:43,423
Hey, Seo-hyeon, come here, rock-paper-scissors.

1071
00:55:44,049 --> 00:55:44,924
What?

1072
00:55:46,801 --> 00:55:48,261
This isn't your average date.

1073
00:55:49,387 --> 00:55:51,514
This is the only dream date I really want.

1074
00:55:52,432 --> 00:55:54,059
No more dream dates after this?

1075
00:55:54,142 --> 00:55:55,852
For you, yes, but not for me.

1076
00:55:55,935 --> 00:55:57,645
-You'll be done? -Yeah.

1077
00:55:57,729 --> 00:56:00,023
-Who wants to challenge us? -Me?

1078
00:56:00,106 --> 00:56:02,692
-He'll do it. -Me, too. I wanna go.

1079
00:56:05,236 --> 00:56:08,448
Hey, Jung-yun, if you wanna go, get yourself a date.

1080
00:56:08,531 --> 00:56:09,949
I need a date.

1081
00:56:10,033 --> 00:56:11,493
Wanna go?

1082
00:56:12,494 --> 00:56:13,328
Always.

1083
00:56:14,746 --> 00:56:18,166
I wanna be selfish and just go, but you're weakening my resolve.

1084
00:56:18,249 --> 00:56:20,043
Don't be selfish. It's bad.

1085
00:56:20,126 --> 00:56:22,545
-I'll leave it up to you guys. -[laughter]

1086
00:56:22,629 --> 00:56:26,091
Sang-won and Seo-hyeon, you should make a choice right now.

1087
00:56:26,925 --> 00:56:28,676
You don't want people to get impatient.

1088
00:56:30,762 --> 00:56:32,305
-Se-yeon is being pushy. -Oh, Se-yeon.

1089
00:56:32,388 --> 00:56:34,182
He's doing it on purpose. He's sneaky.

1090
00:56:34,265 --> 00:56:36,559
He doesn't want Jung-yun and Ji-woo to go.

1091
00:56:36,643 --> 00:56:40,772
-If you guys wanna go, then go, if not… -[Sang-won] But we can't shoot for it.

1092
00:56:40,855 --> 00:56:43,566
-It's true. -Let's do it first come, first served.

1093
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:46,486
-He's doing it. Come on. -Life is about making decisions.

1094
00:56:46,569 --> 00:56:48,696
[Seo-hyeon] Life's on a first come, first serve basis.

1095
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:49,989
Let us know how it goes.

1096
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:52,909
-[Hee-ji] I'm so jealous. -[Sang-won] No one for stargazing?

1097
00:56:52,992 --> 00:56:56,329
If no one chooses it, someone will lose their ticket.

1098
00:56:57,038 --> 00:56:58,540
I'm curious about stargazing.

1099
00:56:59,290 --> 00:57:01,501
-Are you going? -Are you going?

1100
00:57:01,584 --> 00:57:04,170
What if someone's name is up there when we wake up?

1101
00:57:05,713 --> 00:57:07,006
Let's call it a night.

1102
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:09,467
Yeah, let's talk for a bit more than call it a night.

1103
00:57:10,802 --> 00:57:14,180
-[Ji-min] Time to wrap up. -[Jung-yun] I'll take care of the dishes.

1104
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:18,101
-I really wanted to go to Lotte. -[Sang-won] You were a bit too late.

1105
00:57:18,184 --> 00:57:21,062
-More like five steps too late. -You needed an agreement.

1106
00:57:21,146 --> 00:57:22,772
You agreed to it.

1107
00:57:22,856 --> 00:57:24,899
My answer is always yes.

1108
00:57:24,983 --> 00:57:26,901
Always yes for Lotte World.

1109
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:29,904
Are you happy we won?

1110
00:57:29,988 --> 00:57:32,157
-Huh? -Are you excited for Lotte World?

1111
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:35,076
I am, but I feel bad for the others.

1112
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:36,786
Yeah, me too.

1113
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:40,415
-I feel a little bad. -But now I feel guilty.

1114
00:57:40,957 --> 00:57:42,459
-[Seo-hyeon] Totally. -Yeah.

1115
00:57:42,542 --> 00:57:44,002
Why do you feel guilty?

1116
00:57:44,085 --> 00:57:45,128
Because…

1117
00:57:45,211 --> 00:57:48,089
Just ride Atlantis three times and tell us how it was.

1118
00:57:48,173 --> 00:57:49,757
-Tell us about it. -[Seo-hyeon] Okay.

1119
00:57:49,841 --> 00:57:52,427
-I'm fine as long as I get a full report. -[Seo-hyeon] Okay.

1120
00:57:52,510 --> 00:57:55,972
Hey, why are you doing the dishes? Jung-yun and I can do it.

1121
00:57:56,055 --> 00:57:58,558
He's right. You guys didn't even eat. Move. Move.

1122
00:57:58,641 --> 00:58:00,477
It's fine. The two of us can do it.

1123
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:02,812
You're just offering because you feel guilty.

1124
00:58:02,896 --> 00:58:05,064
[indistinct chatter]

1125
00:58:06,608 --> 00:58:08,943
[Ji-woo] That sounds like a dream date.

1126
00:58:15,617 --> 00:58:16,951
[sighs] What should I do?

1127
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:19,329
[sighs]

1128
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:23,333
[indistinct chatter]

1129
00:58:25,210 --> 00:58:26,836
I don't know what to do.

1130
00:58:27,504 --> 00:58:28,880
Stop overthinking it.

1131
00:58:28,963 --> 00:58:30,256
Just stop.

1132
00:58:31,883 --> 00:58:33,468
I'm unsure about everything.

1133
00:58:34,177 --> 00:58:36,554
Unsure about Se-yeon. Unsure about myself.

1134
00:58:38,097 --> 00:58:39,974
What did you talk about with Se-yeon?

1135
00:58:40,058 --> 00:58:41,184
With Se-yeon?

1136
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:43,269
Uh…

1137
00:58:44,229 --> 00:58:45,230
You can tell us.

1138
00:58:48,024 --> 00:58:51,027
We talked about something unexpected.

1139
00:58:51,110 --> 00:58:52,028
What's that?

1140
00:58:53,404 --> 00:58:54,364
Se-yeon…

1141
00:58:58,284 --> 00:58:59,160
said…

1142
00:58:59,661 --> 00:59:01,788
there's someone else he's interested in.

1143
00:59:02,789 --> 00:59:06,584
He wants to go on dates with both you and me.

1144
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:08,378
That's what he said.

1145
00:59:09,045 --> 00:59:10,755
He's starting to like me more

1146
00:59:11,297 --> 00:59:13,383
and wants to get to know me better.

1147
00:59:19,389 --> 00:59:21,849
[sighs] Why am I so sad all of a sudden?

1148
00:59:21,933 --> 00:59:23,268
Don't be.

1149
00:59:24,477 --> 00:59:25,853
Don't be sad.

1150
00:59:25,937 --> 00:59:28,439
I have no idea how I feel or what to think.

1151
00:59:28,523 --> 00:59:30,692
I've never been so confused in my life.

1152
00:59:32,694 --> 00:59:34,404
Stop worrying so much.

1153
00:59:35,154 --> 00:59:36,948
Just do what you wanna do.

1154
00:59:44,539 --> 00:59:46,374
-She's right. -[Ji-eun] She is.

1155
00:59:47,375 --> 00:59:48,293
Right.

1156
00:59:49,794 --> 00:59:52,338
I thought that Ye-rin was dealing pretty well.

1157
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:54,382
-She's sad, but she wasn't. -No.

1158
00:59:54,966 --> 00:59:58,094
I don't think you can ever get used to that feeling

1159
00:59:58,177 --> 01:00:00,805
when you realize the person who you're attracted to

1160
01:00:00,888 --> 01:00:03,141
is attracted to somebody else.

1161
01:00:03,224 --> 01:00:06,060
-It doesn't matter how old you are. -[Ji-eun] It doesn't.

1162
01:00:06,144 --> 01:00:06,978
It's always tough.

1163
01:00:07,061 --> 01:00:09,105
-[Ji-eun] It sucks. -It's heartbreaking.

1164
01:00:09,188 --> 01:00:11,024
Yeah, your heart breaks.

1165
01:00:11,107 --> 01:00:12,191
There's a void.

1166
01:00:13,151 --> 01:00:15,361
Ye-rin is going through her first heartbreak.

1167
01:00:15,445 --> 01:00:16,321
Yes.

1168
01:00:16,404 --> 01:00:18,114
She's starting to know what love is.

1169
01:00:18,948 --> 01:00:20,408
It's okay to be sad.

1170
01:00:22,785 --> 01:00:27,332
DAY TWO AS 20-YEAR-OLDS

1171
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:30,501
[Hee-ji] You look like Santa Claus.

1172
01:00:31,336 --> 01:00:32,420
[Ji-woo] Mrs. Claus.

1173
01:00:32,962 --> 01:00:35,173
Mrs. Claus. I should go dressed like this.

1174
01:00:36,215 --> 01:00:38,635
I wonder if anyone picked stargazing.

1175
01:00:38,718 --> 01:00:40,470
I mean, stargazing sounds fun,

1176
01:00:40,553 --> 01:00:42,388
but compared to Lotte World Adventure,

1177
01:00:42,472 --> 01:00:43,806
-it's a bit boring. -Yeah.

1178
01:00:44,849 --> 01:00:46,059
It's not as exciting.

1179
01:00:47,101 --> 01:00:48,853
So nobody's going stargazing?

1180
01:00:48,936 --> 01:00:50,271
There's no name.

1181
01:00:50,355 --> 01:00:51,773
We needed to choose by 9:00.

1182
01:00:51,856 --> 01:00:54,567
-It's past 9:00. I think so. -It's past 9:00 already?

1183
01:00:55,193 --> 01:00:56,152
What time is it?

1184
01:00:56,653 --> 01:00:58,154
So one dream date is lost?

1185
01:01:00,239 --> 01:01:03,618
-[Ye-rin] It's lost? -[Seo-yeong] One dream date is lost.

1186
01:01:04,535 --> 01:01:07,121
LOTTE WORLD ADVENTURE OH SANG-WON

1187
01:01:07,205 --> 01:01:09,707
STARGAZING

1188
01:01:10,458 --> 01:01:11,668
[men panting]

1189
01:01:22,804 --> 01:01:25,556
-[both grunting] -[Jung-yun] I'll die!

1190
01:01:29,227 --> 01:01:30,520
How are you still going?

1191
01:01:31,562 --> 01:01:33,147
[Pyeong-seok] I'm from Daegu.

1192
01:01:35,108 --> 01:01:37,860
[Se-yeon] Let's try to make it back in under 30 seconds.

1193
01:01:39,737 --> 01:01:41,489
[men grunting]

1194
01:01:48,329 --> 01:01:50,456
[Sang-won chuckling]

1195
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:51,582
[Jung-yun] Attaboy.

1196
01:01:55,169 --> 01:01:56,754
[Pyeong-seok] Just a few more.

1197
01:01:58,297 --> 01:02:00,216
More. More.

1198
01:02:00,883 --> 01:02:02,760
[grunting]

1199
01:02:06,222 --> 01:02:08,182
-Done. -[Jung-yun] So early in the morning.

1200
01:02:08,266 --> 01:02:09,809
[Pyeong-seok] Ah, feels good.

1201
01:02:11,853 --> 01:02:13,396
[Jung-yun] That was a great workout.

1202
01:02:13,479 --> 01:02:14,355
Good job.

1203
01:02:15,982 --> 01:02:18,943
-The sky is so clear today. -[Ji-woo] The weather is nice.

1204
01:02:19,026 --> 01:02:21,612
Perfect weather for Lotte World Adventure.

1205
01:02:21,696 --> 01:02:23,448
Oh, yeah, it's today, right?

1206
01:02:24,031 --> 01:02:25,408
Can you make us a video?

1207
01:02:25,491 --> 01:02:27,118
What time are you going?

1208
01:02:27,201 --> 01:02:28,494
We're leaving at 8:00.

1209
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:30,037
That's late.

1210
01:02:31,456 --> 01:02:33,291
By the way, did you get to tell Ye-rin?

1211
01:02:33,916 --> 01:02:35,918
I told her yesterday in front of the fire.

1212
01:02:36,002 --> 01:02:37,587
[Hee-ji] Yeah, she did.

1213
01:02:38,087 --> 01:02:40,965
-It was a weird vibe when I came home. -Really?

1214
01:02:41,048 --> 01:02:44,385
I couldn't really read Ye-rin's expression.

1215
01:02:46,387 --> 01:02:49,724
It's not like I feel uncomfortable around Ye-rin or anything.

1216
01:02:51,309 --> 01:02:54,729
But I had just found out how Se-yeon felt.

1217
01:02:54,812 --> 01:02:57,064
-So, I was in a bit of shock. -[Hee-ji] That was nuts.

1218
01:02:58,316 --> 01:03:01,152
You know, out of all the guys,

1219
01:03:01,235 --> 01:03:04,071
I feel like you're the only one I can talk to about my problems.

1220
01:03:04,155 --> 01:03:05,698
So you're not attracted to me?

1221
01:03:05,782 --> 01:03:07,658
Stop. Come on.

1222
01:03:07,742 --> 01:03:10,036
Why do you think I gave you the book?

1223
01:03:10,745 --> 01:03:12,246
Fine. I'm a good listener.

1224
01:03:13,956 --> 01:03:16,042
What did the guys talk about?

1225
01:03:16,125 --> 01:03:18,002
Does Se-yeon ever talk about me?

1226
01:03:19,712 --> 01:03:22,465
-That's what I want to know. -[Sang-won] Well, Se-yeon…

1227
01:03:23,090 --> 01:03:25,968
I didn't hear from Se-yeon but from someone else.

1228
01:03:26,761 --> 01:03:29,388
Well, I heard Se-yeon has feelings for some girls

1229
01:03:29,472 --> 01:03:31,057
and you're one of them.

1230
01:03:32,934 --> 01:03:35,102
[Ye-rin] I have a lot of affection for Se-yeon.

1231
01:03:35,978 --> 01:03:38,564
If I'm honest, I'd say he's the one I like the most.

1232
01:03:40,441 --> 01:03:42,860
But I haven't had much time with Pyeong-seok.

1233
01:03:42,944 --> 01:03:43,861
[Sang-won] Right.

1234
01:03:45,363 --> 01:03:46,948
And I would really like to.

1235
01:03:49,826 --> 01:03:54,413
So, I don't know if I should use my dream date on Se-yeon or on Pyeong-seok.

1236
01:03:54,497 --> 01:03:57,917
If I use it on Pyeong-seok, I might lose Se-yeon.

1237
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,752
[Sang-won] I understand.

1238
01:03:59,836 --> 01:04:03,214
I mean choosing someone to go out with on your dream date,

1239
01:04:03,297 --> 01:04:04,757
it's a big deal.

1240
01:04:05,383 --> 01:04:08,761
I want to go out with Se-yeon and I want to go out with Pyeong-seok.

1241
01:04:08,845 --> 01:04:10,596
I wanna go out with both of them.

1242
01:04:11,973 --> 01:04:12,890
And…

1243
01:04:16,352 --> 01:04:20,106
I'm afraid that if I ask one of them, I'll immediately lose the other one.

1244
01:04:20,189 --> 01:04:21,023
I can tell.

1245
01:04:21,607 --> 01:04:24,944
So you're saying that if you ask one of them out on a date,

1246
01:04:25,027 --> 01:04:26,863
the other one won't ask you out?

1247
01:04:26,946 --> 01:04:28,447
-[Ye-rin] Yeah. -It's possible.

1248
01:04:28,531 --> 01:04:31,158
If Se-yeon picked another girl for his dream date,

1249
01:04:31,242 --> 01:04:33,411
then I probably wouldn't ask him out.

1250
01:04:33,494 --> 01:04:34,412
Still.

1251
01:04:34,495 --> 01:04:37,039
Even if I said I could, I don't think I could.

1252
01:04:37,874 --> 01:04:39,292
I can relate to that.

1253
01:04:39,375 --> 01:04:41,836
I wanted Seo-hyeon to ask me out on a dream date.

1254
01:04:42,503 --> 01:04:45,548
And I would have been upset if she asked someone else.

1255
01:04:45,631 --> 01:04:46,799
Yeah, for sure.

1256
01:04:46,883 --> 01:04:48,134
Anyway--

1257
01:04:48,217 --> 01:04:50,511
But you get to go with the person you're into.

1258
01:04:50,595 --> 01:04:52,680
[Sang-won] Yeah. That's true.

1259
01:04:53,347 --> 01:04:54,432
I always thought

1260
01:04:54,515 --> 01:04:56,934
I didn't care what other people think of me…

1261
01:04:57,018 --> 01:04:58,769
-You're-- -…but I actually do.

1262
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:04,317
You don't have to hold back expressing your feelings though.

1263
01:05:04,817 --> 01:05:05,693
It's not healthy.

1264
01:05:06,694 --> 01:05:07,695
-Really. -Right.

1265
01:05:13,534 --> 01:05:15,494
If you don't express your emotions,

1266
01:05:15,578 --> 01:05:17,830
you can't expect people to guess how you feel.

1267
01:05:20,082 --> 01:05:22,126
You should just follow your heart.

1268
01:05:24,170 --> 01:05:26,881
Right. Oh, I don't know. [sighs]

1269
01:05:30,384 --> 01:05:31,636
YE-RIN

1270
01:05:31,719 --> 01:05:35,765
Honestly, after talking with Sang-won, I felt even more uncertain.

1271
01:05:36,432 --> 01:05:38,184
I don't know where I stand with Se-yeon

1272
01:05:38,267 --> 01:05:40,645
and I don't know how to approach Pyeong-seok.

1273
01:05:40,728 --> 01:05:41,729
[sighs]

1274
01:05:43,272 --> 01:05:45,232
[Ji-woo] Let's have some strawberries.

1275
01:05:45,316 --> 01:05:47,568
[Seo-yeong] Let's have some strawberries.

1276
01:05:47,652 --> 01:05:49,695
Wow, Ji-min. Nice colors.

1277
01:05:50,905 --> 01:05:52,740
-Nice colors. -Matching outfits.

1278
01:05:52,823 --> 01:05:55,034
-We're wearing matching outfits. -Oh, really?

1279
01:05:55,117 --> 01:05:56,327
We matched.

1280
01:05:57,620 --> 01:05:59,664
[Ji-woo gasps] That looks so good.

1281
01:05:59,747 --> 01:06:01,290
[Sang-won] Bon appétit.

1282
01:06:02,917 --> 01:06:04,502
[Ye-rin] Wow. It's sweet.

1283
01:06:06,003 --> 01:06:08,172
Ji-min, you passed out yesterday, huh?

1284
01:06:08,255 --> 01:06:09,131
[Ji-min] Mm-hmm.

1285
01:06:11,217 --> 01:06:12,385
Yeah, I was tired.

1286
01:06:13,010 --> 01:06:14,762
I went to my room to watch TV.

1287
01:06:14,845 --> 01:06:15,888
All alone?

1288
01:06:18,391 --> 01:06:20,184
I don't know why I find that sad.

1289
01:06:20,267 --> 01:06:22,895
-What? -What Ji-min said.

1290
01:06:22,979 --> 01:06:24,146
It makes me sad.

1291
01:06:26,023 --> 01:06:27,817
I'm too sensitive. [chuckles]

1292
01:06:28,401 --> 01:06:31,195
-Wait, did the two of you talk? -Mm-hmm.

1293
01:06:31,278 --> 01:06:33,614
You did? Huh? When?

1294
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:35,199
What do you mean?

1295
01:06:35,282 --> 01:06:36,617
You were there.

1296
01:06:38,327 --> 01:06:40,579
I'd like to talk to you today, please.

1297
01:06:41,247 --> 01:06:42,707
-Okay. -Hm?

1298
01:06:43,874 --> 01:06:45,584
[all mimicking Seo-yeong] Hm?

1299
01:06:45,668 --> 01:06:46,669
[Ji-min] Nothing.

1300
01:06:47,253 --> 01:06:49,255
[all continue mimicking] Hm.

1301
01:06:49,338 --> 01:06:52,425
It's nothing. It's nothing.

1302
01:06:58,055 --> 01:06:59,223
[Ji-min] How about in here?

1303
01:06:59,306 --> 01:07:00,766
[Ji-woo] Sure. I've never been.

1304
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:02,351
I was here with Ye-rin.

1305
01:07:02,435 --> 01:07:05,229
-Really? What did you talk about? -I can't tell you.

1306
01:07:05,312 --> 01:07:08,482
-Oh, sorry. Okay. -All right, let's talk.

1307
01:07:09,817 --> 01:07:10,776
[Ji-woo] Okay.

1308
01:07:11,944 --> 01:07:14,196
I want to go on a dream date with you.

1309
01:07:14,947 --> 01:07:16,991
Would you say yes if I asked you out?

1310
01:07:17,074 --> 01:07:19,076
[closing theme music playing]
