-Let's go, let's go, let's go. -Let's go.

15
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,652
Wow, reserving an entire theater? I'm excited.

16
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:11,279
Yeah, I'm excited.

17
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:14,908
Where, where… Oh, there it is.

18
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:17,619
-Oh. -[Seo-yeong] Wow.

19
00:01:17,702 --> 00:01:19,454
-So cool. -[Sang-won] Pretty fancy.

20
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:21,664
Yo.

21
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:25,001
-Yo. -[chuckles] It's pretty fancy.

Oh, wow. [chuckles softly]

00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:33,510
-This is so nice. -Oh!

26
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:37,013
-This is super nice. Hey, popcorn! -Wow, that looks good.

27
00:01:37,096 --> 00:01:38,515
Caramel popcorn is the best.

28
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:42,143
What kind of movies do you like? Oh! It's starting.

29
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:54,489
Here, put your name and your birthday down and…

30
00:01:54,572 --> 00:01:55,865
The pager number.

31
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:59,077
You get a free movie if you put your pager number down.

32
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:03,206
Is that… Is that how she's getting his number? [laughs]

33
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:06,626
So, they can talk while watching because they're the only ones there.

34
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:08,169
That's nice.

35
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:10,797
-It's like watching at home. -[Se-woon] Exactly.

36
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,966
[man] Your voice… it's pretty.

37
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:15,385
-Oh. -[exclaims]

38
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:18,096
Oh, that's way too sweet.

Hey.

00:02:33,736 --> 00:02:35,697
[both] Oh!

43
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:40,451
[Seo-yeong] Are they both trying to get the girl right now?

44
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:42,495
[Sang-won] I think I've seen this before.

45
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:44,747
Not this movie, but I've seen this scene before.

46
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:46,416
You know, with our group.

00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:48,334

00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:55,174
First of all, it was so cool that we had the whole theater to ourselves.

50
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:57,719
It was as nice as I expected it to be.

51
00:02:57,802 --> 00:02:58,678
SANG-WON

52
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:00,346
During the movie, we were free to talk about

53
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,223
what we were feeling or thinking.

54
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:05,518
I think it made the movie a lot more fun.

55
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:11,858
-[Seo-yeong] This place has a nice vibe. -[Sang-won] Yeah. It's super pretty.

56
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:14,027
[Seo-yeong] Why is this place so pretty?

57
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:17,530
-How do you feel about our date today? -It was so much fun.

58
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:18,907
Yeah, I feel the same.

59
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,533
-We click pretty well. -Yes, ma'am.

60
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:22,702
We clicked better than I thought we would.

61
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:23,620
[Seo-yeong] Yeah.

62
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:25,705
Honestly,

63
00:03:25,788 --> 00:03:29,500
if you're okay with it, I want to go on another date with you sometime.

64
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:32,462
-Ma'am, it'd be my honor always. -Okay, all right, sir.

65
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:34,380
Seo-yeong is being super bold.

66
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:37,216
She's being bold. She's being super bold.

67
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:41,512
Honestly, I've been dying to ask you so many things.

68
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:45,892
Ask me everything that you've been wanting to ask.

69
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:48,937
I've been curious about who you like, and in what order?

70
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,481
Oh. Rank the girls I like?

71
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:55,652
To be honest, I've only been certain about my number one.

72
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:57,195
But I'm not sure about the rest.

73
00:03:57,278 --> 00:03:59,489
You probably know who's number one.

74
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:02,158
-Seo-hyeon? Yeah. -You probably know. Other than her?

75
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,785
Well, yeah.

76
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:05,578
-What about you? -Me?

77
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:08,164
For me, if you had to guess,

78
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,333
-what would you say? -I mean, actually,

79
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:13,044
-honestly, I was surprised. -Be completely honest.

80
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:16,547
When you asked me out on a date yesterday, that came out of nowhere.

81
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:20,176
-Oh. Out of nowhere? -The thing is, until now,

82
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,595
I've never got the feeling that you were trying

83
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:24,806
-to get to know me better. -I suddenly--

84
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:27,475
-Right, right, right. -Yeah, so…

85
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:33,898
If I'm being honest, here's what I've been thinking.

86
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:36,776
I thought about this after listening to the other girls.

87
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:39,070
I realized, "Oh, Sang-won is the one

88
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:42,198
who I felt the most comfortable with during my stay here."

89
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,200
I came to understand that.

90
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:46,077
Compared to the others,

91
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:50,415
I haven't had to force myself to come up with…

92
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:54,002
I haven't had to think, "What should I say?"

93
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:56,212
-So that's why? -Yeah, yeah.

94
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,463
So, that's why.

95
00:04:57,547 --> 00:05:00,425
I wanted to get to know you better and get closer to you.

96
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:03,386
But I haven't been able to talk to you.

97
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:07,098
Because it seemed like you were closer to someone else.

98
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:09,976
-So I kind of gathered up my courage. -Mm-hmm.

99
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:15,648
You know, I'm pretty honest, aren't I?

100
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:18,985
I feel like I'm seeing a lot of things in a new light today.

101
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:20,695
About you, I mean.

102
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:22,989
-In a good way. -In a good way?

103
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:24,824
That's good.

104
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,827
[Sang-won] Tomato pickle. Never had that before.

105
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:30,705
-I like tomatoes. -I love tomatoes, too.

106
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:36,461
Mm!

107
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:39,422
Mm. I didn't know a tomato could taste like this.

108
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:42,467
This is so good. Best thing I've eaten on a date so far.

109
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,510
I mean, I've only been on one date.

110
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:46,387
-But that's the best. -The best?

111
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:50,641
That's good. That means it's number one. Not bad. I'm glad.

112
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:53,895
-Yeah, you're number one. -[chuckles softly]

113
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,564
Well, sir, how does that feel?

114
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:58,316
-[laughing] -It's an honor, ma'am.

115
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,234
It's an honor, yeah.

116
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:02,487
[Seo-yeong] You are so funny.

117
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:06,032
-Ah, that's good. -Yeah, for real.

118
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:09,118
I can't really say that I had fun because, uh…

119
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:11,746
I kept feeling a bit uncomfortable.

120
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:15,458
The things is, Seo-yeong pretty much knows I have feelings for someone else.

121
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:18,669
I don't want to go on dates with her if I'm feeling that way.

122
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:21,172
So, I want to talk with her more,

123
00:06:21,255 --> 00:06:23,841
but I don't want to go on any more dates yet.

124
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:24,759
-Oh! -Oh!

125
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:26,344
-[Kyuhyun] Right. -[Ji-eun] Really?

126
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:29,305
When Sang-won was talking about the kind of person he dislikes,

127
00:06:29,388 --> 00:06:32,391
he mentioned something about a person who makes things confusing.

128
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:36,771
-I think Sang-won felt uncomfortable. -[Ji-eun] I think that's it.

129
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:38,648
Oh, I think Seo-yeong might be--

130
00:06:39,398 --> 00:06:42,860
She might be too late. Relationships have already been formed.

131
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:46,948
But you never know. So many things happened in just one day.

132
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:48,991
-Right. You never know. -You never know.

133
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:51,244
-I don't trust anything now. -[Ji-eun laughs]

134
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:55,957
[Hee-ji chuckling]

135
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,459
-[Seo-hyeon] Wow. Oh, man. -Wow. This is so nice.

136
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:00,545
Hold on. I'm kind of in shock.

137
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:02,964
-Huh? Are you cold? -No, I'm in shock.

138
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,174
It's so pretty.

139
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:07,009
[sighs]

140
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,428
[Seo-hyeon] Wow, this is beautiful.

141
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:12,765
-[Hee-ji] Isn't this super comfortable? -[Seo-hyeon] Totally.

142
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,519
I'm worried about something though.

143
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:20,314
Today Sang-won and I went in the Room of Truth.

144
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:22,191
-[Hee-ji] Oh, yeah? -And--

145
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:23,693
-[Hee-ji] Did you talk? -Mm.

146
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:27,196
-"You're the only one…" -"For me"?

147
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,740
-[chuckles] -"For me." He kind of said it like that.

148
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:30,825
[Hee-ji] Seriously?

149
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:34,036
Wow, he's so good with his words and expressing his emotions.

150
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,913
So I just feel super dizzy.

151
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:40,042
I mean, I've kind of been like, "Let's get to know everybody."

152
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:44,046
But I can see that Sang-won has been feeling this way for me

153
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,715
from the very beginning.

154
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:49,886
You know, in my opinion,

155
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:53,055
it's super obvious that Sang-won likes you.

156
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:57,393
But it feels like you've gotten too comfortable.

157
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:58,895
I'm worried about that, too.

158
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:02,523
Being comfortable with somebody versus liking them, that's so…

159
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:06,360
I think I'll know how I feel after going on some dates with other people.

160
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:09,780
I want to know the difference between the way I feel about Sang-won

161
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:12,783
and how I feel when I'm on a date with other guys.

162
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:16,370
[sighs]

163
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:17,872
This is so hard.

164
00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:23,419
I wish people would stop worrying about everything

165
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:24,879
and just be happy.

166
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:27,507
-They all have worries. -Everyone's worried about something.

167
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:30,384
-Everybody has so many problems. -Everybody has so many worries.

168
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:33,262
-I don't have any, though. -Yeah.

169
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,223
Oh, you guys are just so cute.

170
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:37,016
-What do you mean? -I mean it.

171
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:41,062
Now that the no-dating rule is gone, it's like you guys are actually dating.

172
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:43,731
I think you guys will go on a dream date together,

173
00:08:43,814 --> 00:08:46,442
then not go on a dream date with anybody else.

174
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:50,821
What about you? What about you? Your dream date?

175
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:53,699
My dream date? I think I'll ask Jung-yun.

176
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:55,826
-Huh? -[Se-woon] Jung-yun?

177
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:58,120
-Oh! This is unexpected. -[Su-hyun] Jung-yun?

178
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:00,748
Oh. I mean, Jung-yun is so entertaining.

179
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:02,667
Isn't it fun to tease him?

180
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:04,377
Right?

181
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:09,840
It's kind of fun when I'm with Jung-yun.

182
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:12,343
I feel more comfortable too.

183
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:15,137
I felt that way yesterday and today, too.

184
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:18,391
I kind of feel like I have a bond with Jung-yun.

185
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:20,601
When I want something, I just--

186
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:24,605
So I want to go on a dream date with Jung-yun.

187
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:27,149
Ah, Jung-yun is suddenly so popular.

188
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:28,693
Funny guys are so popular.

189
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:31,529
Seo-hyeon seemed comfortable when she was with Jung-yun.

190
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:33,364
And she seemed a lot more playful.

191
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:36,534
Totally different than when she was with Sang-won.

192
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:38,286
It's confusing when a guy is funny.

193
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:39,996
You wonder if that's why you like him or…

194
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:42,039
[Seo-hyeon] We need to ask before midnight.

195
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:44,041
Right. Should I ask him now?

196
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:45,626
[chuckles]

197
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:48,462
-Hey, hold on! -[both laughing]

198
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:53,801
[Seo-hyeon] He's sleeping.

199
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:55,803
He's sleeping like a baby.

200
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:57,638
[Hee-ji] Is he alone?

201
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:00,975
[Seo-hyeon sighs]

202
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:03,936
[Seo-hyeon] Ugh, I need to ask him right now.

203
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,315
[Hee-ji] Go ahead. I'll be in the room.

204
00:10:15,906 --> 00:10:16,991
[knocking softly]

205
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:19,869
[knocking continues]

206
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:22,330
Hey!

207
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:24,790
Jung-yun.

208
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:28,252
[laughing]

209
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:41,140
[Ye-rin] Huh? Where is everybody?

210
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:50,566
Oh.

211
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:51,567
Fell asleep?

212
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:56,280
-What about Seo-hyeon? -Seo-hyeon just woke up.

213
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:03,871
Seo-hyeon said she wants to tell you something.

214
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:06,040
-Me? -She said she tried to wake you up.

215
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:07,875
-[Hee-ji clears throat] -Oh.

216
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:10,419
She went to wake you up, but she couldn't tell you

217
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:11,962
because you were sound asleep.

218
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:13,422
You're doing great, Hee-ji.

219
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:16,425
-Hee-ji's helping her friends a lot. -[Ji-eun] I wanna be her friend.

220
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:17,968
[sighs]

221
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:20,388
[knock at door]

222
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:22,556
-[Jung-yun] Are you in there? -Hello?

223
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,017
[Jung-yun] Did you try to wake me up earlier?

224
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:26,185
Why?

225
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:28,479
-Doing anything tomorrow? -No.

226
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:30,898
-Not doing anything? -I don't have any plans.

227
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:32,191
[softly] You don't?

228
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:35,528
Do you want to go on a dream date or a casual date with me tomorrow?

229
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:36,445
[softly] What?

230
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,989
Do you want to go on a dream date or a casual date?

231
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:40,783
-With you? -What do you think?

232
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:43,077
-I don't have any plans. -You don't?

233
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,870
-Want to go? Okay. -Sure.

234
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:46,914
Let me put on some makeup.

235
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:48,290
Did you just wake up?

236
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:50,459
I woke up a while ago. Like, 20 minutes.

237
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:52,545
[in normal voice] Well, I just woke up.

238
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:55,214
-Oh, is that why you came over? -Yeah.

239
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:57,758
I mean, I knocked and I kept calling your name.

240
00:11:57,842 --> 00:11:59,802
Like, "Jung-yun."

241
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:02,263
I was like this. I was totally out of it.

242
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:03,722
You just kept sleeping.

243
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:05,433
-Who told you? -Hee-ji.

244
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:09,687
Okay.

245
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:17,862
Wow.

246
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:19,029
It's Hee-ji.

247
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:20,656
[sighs]

248
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:25,035
-Nice shot, Hee-ji. Nice shot, Hee-ji. -She's a good friend.

249
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:27,538
She's been saying it since she was at the school.

250
00:12:27,621 --> 00:12:28,456
[Se-woon] Right.

251
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:31,876
She said "I want to talk with everybody and get to know them."

252
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:35,629
She's moved on from Sang-won and starting something with Jung-yun.

253
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:39,175
-I have a good feeling about these. -[Ji-eun] Me, too.

254
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:40,801
This is how things get messy.

255
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:43,345
-Get messy! -[Ji-eun] It's getting interesting.

256
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:45,181
Super messy like tangled earphones!

257
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:47,516
-[Pyeong-seok] Were you bored? -[Hee-ji] Yeah.

258
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:52,062
I was really, really bored.

259
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:54,648
-Where did you go? -Uh, a manga cafe.

260
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:55,941
-A manga cafe? -Yeah.

261
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:59,069
-We didn't do anything. -You didn't do anything?

262
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:01,489
Yeah. We just sat there super seriously.

263
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:05,451
Oh, I really want to go on a dream date.

264
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:07,328
They'll give us something big soon.

265
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:09,121
-[laughing] -I feel like it's time.

266
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:11,832
Maybe the Lotte World one was too big.

267
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:14,502
-I totally agree with you though. -Right?

268
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:20,883
[soft music playing]

269
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:25,596
[Hee-ji] You look really good with your hair slicked back.

270
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:28,474
[Hee-ji chuckles softly]

271
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,976
You can look me in the eyes now.

272
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:33,395
[Pyeong-seok chuckles softly]

273
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:45,574
Wow. I really want to draw something here.

274
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:49,161
Do you want to draw something? Let's go.

275
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:51,080
[Hee-ji laughing]

276
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:53,791
[Hee-ji] This will be fun. [laughing]

277
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:57,461
Where do you want to sit? You want to sit here?

278
00:13:57,545 --> 00:14:00,422
-[chuckles] -Wow, this room is huge.

279
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:03,133
Oh, I guess it's because five people sleep in here.

280
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:08,097
[both chuckling]

281
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:10,516
[chuckles] Let's go.

282
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:12,601
[upbeat music playing]

283
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,778
[Hee-ji laughing]

284
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,248
[phone camera clicking]

285
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:37,293
Wow, your eyelashes are so long.

286
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:40,588
-[laughing] -One second.

287
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:44,633
[both laughing]

288
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:51,223
[Ji-woo] Oh, did they all go--

289
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:54,268
-Where is everybody? In the basement? -[Se-yeon shivers]

290
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:56,770
[Ji-woo] Oh!

291
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:58,731
You must be cold.

292
00:14:58,814 --> 00:15:00,608
[Ye-rin] I'm going to the bathroom.

293
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:03,611
[Se-yeon] …your clothes, you're wearing only half of it.

294
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:05,321
-Huh? They're back. -Who's back?

295
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:07,489
The people who went on a date.

296
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:09,867
-Is it Sang-won? -No, no. Se-yeon and Ji-woo.

297
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:11,201
I'm not going outside.

298
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:20,336
[Ye-rin] Where the heck is he?

299
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:25,799
Where did he go? Where is he?

300
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:27,927
Where is he?

301
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:29,970
-What? -Come here.

302
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:35,809
Uh, is my outfit too dark?

303
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:38,020
No, it looks good.

304
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:39,521
Thanks.

305
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,274
Sit down.

306
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:44,985
Yup.

307
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:49,531
[Ye-rin chuckles]

308
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,743
-It's too dirty. -Mm-mmm.

309
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,040
How was the date?

310
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:03,212
The date? Oh, I mean, we didn't do much other than eating dinner.

311
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:06,423
It was nice to eat good food.

312
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:08,634
Be honest.

313
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:11,220
It was nice to eat good food.

314
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:16,141
Well, when are we going on our date?

315
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:19,103
Do you want to go?

316
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:21,271
Do you want to go?

317
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:24,274
Let's go. We can talk a lot.

318
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:28,278
We can go and eat some good food.

319
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:30,781
I guess that'd be nice.

320
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:34,702
I'm super conflicted. I don't know who to bring on my dream date.

321
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:38,747
I'm curious about you. But honestly, I have no idea what you're thinking.

322
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:42,543
I just want to know who you're gonna take on your dream date.

323
00:16:42,626 --> 00:16:43,544
Yeah.

324
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:46,338
I kind of want to be careful with my dream date.

325
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:49,842
A dream date is special, of course. But I think what's more important

326
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:53,470
is that you go on the date with somebody who you want to go with.

327
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:57,141
So I just want to be a bit more… careful.

328
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:59,393
-You… -Yeah, what?

329
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:00,769
[scoffs]

330
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:03,439
You've changed. You've changed so much.

331
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:04,940
What? [chuckles]

332
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:08,360
[all exclaiming]

333
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:09,820
[Ji-eun] That's cute.

334
00:17:10,654 --> 00:17:11,780
[Se-yeon] What?

335
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,198
[chuckles]

336
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:16,577
[sighs]

337
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:17,995
I…

338
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:19,705
Oh, you've changed.

339
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:20,789
I'm so hurt.

340
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,626
[Se-yeon sighs]

341
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:27,504
Look, we're talking… You're not even looking at my eyes.

342
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:28,922
I can't look at you now.

343
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:31,216
I can't look at you when you're like this.

344
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,134
[Ye-rin] Ugh.

345
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:35,054
You keep pushing me away.

346
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:36,513
Okay, so…

347
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:38,348
[sighs]

348
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:42,644
[sighs]

349
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:46,023
I didn't want to worry about you getting to know other girls.

350
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:46,940
[Se-yeon] Mm.

351
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:49,026
I can't help but worry about it, though.

352
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:51,028
-I'm worried about it. -Mm.

353
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:55,699
Are you not worried about me? Do you not feel jealous?

354
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:58,744
After I said all that stuff to you,

355
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:02,664
I've been wanting to be careful more than anything else.

356
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:07,044
Honestly… I could get to know other people.

357
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:10,297
[sighs] But I…

358
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:13,592
I'm just being careful, that's all. Really.

359
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:20,432
I just wanted to talk things out with Se-yeon as soon as possible.

360
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:21,350
YE-RIN

361
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:25,020
But Se-yeon gave me very unclear answers.

362
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:26,980
They were ambiguous.

363
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,609
He was being so cold, it felt like

364
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:33,237
we were drifting apart.

365
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:37,324
[all laughing]

366
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:39,660
[Seo-hyeon] Why are you so good at this?

367
00:18:40,577 --> 00:18:42,538
[Sang-won panting]

368
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:46,375
-Hey. -[Sang-won] Hey.

369
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,377
You're back so late.

370
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,670
[laughs softly]

371
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:57,052
How many movies did you watch? Six? You're so late.

372
00:18:57,845 --> 00:18:58,971
That's funny.

373
00:18:59,054 --> 00:19:00,055
[all laughing]

374
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:01,140
Not bad.

375
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:03,058
-What? -Your reaction.

376
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:05,144
[Seo-hyeon chuckling] What?

377
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:07,896
[Sang-won] What're you doing tomorrow? You have plans?

378
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:10,524
-Probably. -You do?

379
00:19:10,607 --> 00:19:11,608
[Seo-hyeon] Mm.

380
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:15,696
-[sighs] All right. You're a busy girl. -[Seo-hyeon] Why?

381
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:19,950
I need to have plans. I've been at home all day. I stayed home today.

382
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:22,452
I mean, I was gonna ask you to stay home with me.

383
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:25,247
Who are you going out with tomorrow? Who?

384
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:26,540
I don't know.

385
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,543
[chuckles softly]

386
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:30,627
[sighs]

387
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:34,464
Well, I want

388
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:37,593
to talk with more people…

389
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:40,596
-That way I can-- -But…

390
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:43,473
I can make up my mind.

391
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:45,767
Even after all that, I hope that you pick me.

392
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:46,685
Right.

393
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:48,770
That way, it'll be easier to…

394
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:51,565
-Wait, what? What did you say? -Did you not hear me?

395
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:52,608
I heard you, but…

396
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:55,194
I… I don't know how you feel right now,

397
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:57,487
but even after you talk with the other guys,

398
00:19:57,571 --> 00:19:59,114
I just…

399
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,824
I just hope that you'll pick me.

400
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:04,953
[chuckling] What?

401
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:07,539
SEO-HYEON

402
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:11,460
Um, if I'm being honest after he said that, um…

403
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:14,588
What he said made me feel a bit pressured.

404
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:20,761
I haven't had the chance to spend any time with other guys,

405
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:24,014
and I've never gone on a date with any of them.

406
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:26,600
That was the situation I was in,

407
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:29,478
and then I was caught off guard when Sang-won said,

408
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:32,481
"I hope you'll choose me in the end."

409
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:36,026
-Oh, my God. -[Se-woon] What's happening?

410
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:38,111
Why did she get jealous then?

411
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:39,947
-I don't think she got too jealous. -Yeah.

412
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,949
She was acting jealous to be polite.

413
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:43,617
-Really, is that a thing? -Yeah.

414
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,744
-[Ji-eun] Just to be polite? Oh. -Oh.

415
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:48,288
Yeah, this could be pretty confusing for Sang-won.

416
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:51,667
Yeah, I think he's oblivious about the situation.

417
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,835
-[Kyuhyun] He doesn't know. -Exactly.

418
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,463
I'll sit over there.

419
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:58,048
Yes.

420
00:20:58,131 --> 00:21:00,008
[Pyeong-seok] I'm going for it today.

421
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:03,428
[Sang-won] Ah! Whoo!

422
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:04,346
Okay.

423
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:07,599
[Sang-won laughing] You guys.

424
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:09,268
I'll be watching, okay?

425
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:12,437
Hey, you… Hey, you need to grab it with your right hand today.

426
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:15,399
Look at how they're waiting to write their names quickly.

427
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:16,900
I guess I can't do it today.

428
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:18,819
-Sit down. -Sit down.

429
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:24,241
[Sang-won] Esteemed colleagues, I'll just be watching and having fun.

430
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:26,410
[Ji-min] This is about getting good seats first.

431
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:29,746
Got to pick the right seats.

432
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:32,374
-Come 20 minutes early. -[Jung-yun] You're all dead.

433
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:34,918
-[Pyeong-seok] Yeah, right. -[Ji-min] Then…

434
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:36,044
What are you doing?

435
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:38,505
Should we hide the pen?

436
00:21:38,588 --> 00:21:40,841
[Seo-hyeon] Yeah. We can win this.

437
00:21:40,924 --> 00:21:43,552
-We can beat Ji-min. -How are we supposed to win?

438
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:45,804
-I'll throw you on the floor. -Hey!

439
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:47,597
Hey, you!

440
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:49,057
-What? -What are you doing?

441
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:51,768
Your right pocket. Are you doodling?

442
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:53,145
-What? -The pen used to be there.

443
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:54,730
-And now it's gone. -It's gone?

444
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:56,648
No, it's my lip balm. My lip balm.

445
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:58,483
[Ji-min] He just erased everything.

446
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:00,235
[all laughing]

447
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,571
-That's cheating. Seriously? -That's not nice.

448
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:05,032
-[Pyeong-seok] Well, oh, uh… -[Jung-yun] We got you.

449
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:08,327
-[Seo-hyeon] You hiding it in your sock? -[Jung-yun] Your sock?

450
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:10,370
-I can see it. -[Ji-min] Behind his ear.

451
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:11,872
He put it behind his ear.

452
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:14,166
[all exclaiming] Oh!

453
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:15,459
[Sang-won] Jung-yun!

454
00:22:16,376 --> 00:22:18,378
-What time is it? -[Seo-yeong] 55.

455
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:19,963
-[Jung-yun] 50. -[Seo-yeong] 56.

456
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:23,717
-Let's not act like children. -[Seo-hyeon] Let's not. We're all adults.

457
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,094
[Se-yeon] I've never seen Jung-yun up front before.

458
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:29,014
[Sang-won] What Pyeong-seok is doing now is so funny.

459
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:30,057
Let's be gentlemen.

460
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,808
You should duel like gentlemen.

461
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:34,686
Hey, do you want to write letters to each other today?

462
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:35,645
Wanna write letters?

463
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:39,066
[all] Whoa!

464
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:40,192
Wanna write letters?

465
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:42,235
DREAM DATES: TRIP TO BUSAN, TRIP TO GYEONGJU

466
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:45,447
TRIP TO BUSAN

467
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:49,659
TRIP TO GYEONGJU

468
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:52,454
-Wow, that's awesome. -Come on, let's go, let's go.

469
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:54,706
-They need to go. They need to go. -Go, go!

470
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:57,125
-It'll be an all-day trip. -[Se-woon] They've got to go.

471
00:22:57,209 --> 00:23:00,170
Considering the distance, it has to be an all-day trip.

472
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:02,672
[all exclaim] Whoa!

473
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:05,467
-[Hee-ji] Hey! No, sit down. -[Sang-won] Sit down.

474
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:07,344
-[Seo-hyeon] Why? -[Hee-ji] Sit.

475
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:09,179
-I'm the MC. Sit. -[Jung-yun] Since when?

476
00:23:09,262 --> 00:23:10,639
[Se-yeon] Wow, he's the MC now.

477
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:12,516
-[Pyeong-seok] Sit down. -[gasps]

478
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:15,811
[Sang-won] Would you be leaving early? Oh, it must be a day trip.

479
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:18,480
-Okay, the Gyeongju trip. -[Ji-woo] That's awesome.

480
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:21,399
-Stop trying to be sneaky. -Raise your hand for the Gyeongju trip.

481
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:25,320
Hey, so the Gyeongju trip, huh? The Gyeongju trip?

482
00:23:25,403 --> 00:23:26,279
Nobody?
[all laughing]

483
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,533
-What is he doing? -[Pyeong-seok] Nobody?

484
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:31,701
What about Busan?

485
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:34,246
-[Jung-yun] Why are you writing your name? -Busan?

486
00:23:35,705 --> 00:23:37,958
Hey, hey. Let's just reconvene in 30 minutes.

487
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:40,794
-[Hee-ji] Let's meet in 30 minutes. -Some people might not have…

488
00:23:40,877 --> 00:23:43,380
Hey, some people might not have agreed to go yet.

489
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:45,882
-[Pyeong-seok] Then… -Wow, this is pretty tough.

490
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:48,677
-It's gonna take five… -[Sang-won] Takes four to five hours.

491
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,471
-Aren't you interested? -[Se-yeon] Huh? I'm going to…

492
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:54,307
-[Sang-won] What're you gonna do? -I'll stay here.

493
00:23:57,644 --> 00:23:59,896
[Jung-yun] I… I just want to do them all.

494
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,940
[Sang-won] It's a day trip. A day trip.

495
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:06,069
[Se-yeon] They might put you on a helicopter.

496
00:24:06,153 --> 00:24:07,779
-A plane? -[Seo-hyeon] True.

497
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:09,739
[Ji-woo] Seriously?

498
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:13,076
Oh, where's the pen? Who has the pen?

499
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:17,789
Sit down.

500
00:24:18,456 --> 00:24:21,418
-What feels best? -[Jung-yun] To me? I like them both.

501
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:23,461
[Seo-hyeon] The one that I most--

502
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:26,089
-[Jung-yun] Are we going on a dream date? -Mm.

503
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:28,967
-[Jung-yun] The others… -Where do you wanna go?

504
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:31,303
-[Pyeong-seok] Hm? -Where did you want to go?

505
00:24:31,386 --> 00:24:32,220
Are we going?

506
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:34,097
I'm not sure.

507
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:36,850
-The others are so happy, though. -Yeah.

508
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:39,686
[Pyeong-seok inhales sharply]

509
00:24:40,937 --> 00:24:42,355
Let them go.

510
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,357
Let them go.

511
00:24:49,362 --> 00:24:51,364
[Seo-hyeon] I'm fine with either one.

512
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:55,118
-[Jung-yun] Doesn't Busan sound nice? -[Sang-won] In a car for four hours?

513
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:57,704
-[Jung-yun] It'll take all day? -[Seo-hyeon] Yeah.

514
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:02,083
How are we getting there? First, let's watch our competitors.

515
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:04,294
Don't think anybody's reached an agreement.

516
00:25:04,377 --> 00:25:05,337
Oh, really?

517
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:06,713
[clears throat]

518
00:25:06,796 --> 00:25:08,715
[indistinct chatter]

519
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:22,229
Oh, he's hesitating because Ji-woo's watching.

520
00:25:22,312 --> 00:25:25,315
Oh, if Jung-yun goes on that date right now, though…

521
00:25:25,398 --> 00:25:28,401
Wow, I bet Ji-woo is feeling a brand new emotion right now.

522
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:31,029
Ji-woo wanted Jung-yun to make it clear.

523
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:35,784
It won't be good if he goes on that date right now.

524
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:38,286
-Where are we going? -[Sang-won] That sounds fun.

525
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:39,204
[Se-yeon] Got it?

526
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:42,332
-[Jung-yun] Are you gonna use your ticket? -[Seo-hyeon] Yeah.

527
00:25:42,415 --> 00:25:44,542
-You can come with me. -[Jung-yun] Go with you?

528
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:46,753
-[Seo-hyeon] You don't want to? -I can go with you?

529
00:25:46,836 --> 00:25:49,339
-[Seo-hyeon] You use your ticket later. -Mm.

530
00:26:04,604 --> 00:26:06,439
They're both tough on the schedule.

531
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:08,316
Hurry up and write your name down.

532
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,111
Write your name down if you're going. We should go to bed soon.

533
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:17,909
This is a dream date, so…

534
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:26,626
-You're sad, aren't you? -Yeah.

535
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:29,754
-I really… -That made you tear up?

536
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:32,841
Yeah, I was a little… surprised.

537
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:38,471
Why is this place making me feel so…

538
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:40,473
[sobbing]

539
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:45,603
I was so shocked too.

540
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:50,775
-[Ye-rin] No, that's not it. -I… I need to…

541
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:56,031
[Ye-rin] I mean, I'm not crying because of love.

542
00:26:56,823 --> 00:26:58,950
I've just been having a hard time recently.

543
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:02,454
You know what I mean? I don't know how anybody feels anymore.

544
00:27:02,537 --> 00:27:04,414
-[Ji-eun gasps] -Oh, no.

545
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:08,209
[Ji-eun] Oh, no.

546
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:10,170
[Ye-rin, voice breaking] I mean, why…

547
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:14,007
[Ji-woo] You know what really hurt my feelings, though?

548
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:17,594
-[sniffling] No, what? -When I…

549
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:22,015
When I said I wanted to go on a date, he didn't.

550
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:27,270
Oh, I'm about to cry. He's never been very proactive with me.

551
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:29,564
But he was sitting up front today, right?

552
00:27:29,647 --> 00:27:30,899
So I thought…

553
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:31,900
[Ye-rin sniffs]

554
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:34,569
…he was sitting there for me. [chuckles]

555
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:38,948
I couldn't believe my eyes.

556
00:27:40,283 --> 00:27:41,951
Them talking about where to go.

557
00:27:47,123 --> 00:27:49,084
[footsteps approaching]

558
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:52,504
-Where is everybody? -Talking amongst themselves?

559
00:27:52,587 --> 00:27:54,172
Ye-rin and Ji-woo went there.

560
00:27:54,255 --> 00:27:56,174
Are… Are they talking right now?

561
00:27:56,257 --> 00:27:57,842
[laughs] I have no idea.

562
00:27:57,926 --> 00:27:59,594
-[Jung-yun] Why? -I don't even know.

563
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:04,349
Oh, this is so hard. I'd have to skip my graduation to go.

564
00:28:04,432 --> 00:28:05,642
-Oh, that's true. -Yeah.

565
00:28:05,725 --> 00:28:08,019
-[Sang-won] Ji-woo's is tomorrow. -What are you doing?

566
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:09,896
-A secret meeting. -[Seo-hyeon] Strategy.

567
00:28:09,979 --> 00:28:12,065
-Supposed to be secretive. -Like a strategy.

568
00:28:12,148 --> 00:28:13,817
Strategy? Are you going together?

569
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,735
-[Seo-hyeon] Mm. -Huh? What?

570
00:28:16,444 --> 00:28:18,029
-[all laughing] -What?

571
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:19,864
What, what, what, what?

572
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:23,159
-[Se-yeon] You guys are going together? -[Seo-hyeon] Mm.

573
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:26,121
[all] What? What? What?

574
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:28,373
-What? Why? -It's just--

575
00:28:28,456 --> 00:28:29,582
-You're going? -What?

576
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:32,335
[laughing] What should I even say? This is so funny.

577
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:34,421
-What? -[Seo-hyeon] Why?

578
00:28:34,504 --> 00:28:37,006
What? What? What?

579
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:38,967
There must be a reason. I mean--

580
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:40,427
There must be a reason.

581
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:42,554
[Seo-hyeon] It's the same. It's because…

582
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:49,310
You know, I feel so hurt.

583
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:50,812
[men laughing]

584
00:28:52,647 --> 00:28:54,899
Oh, why is he being so frustrating?

585
00:28:55,525 --> 00:28:57,026
I mean, why? Why?

586
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:59,320
Hey, we have to skip our graduation.

587
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:01,072
My graduation? It's on the 6th.

588
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:03,074
-So I'm not going. -Are you going?

589
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:04,909
[Ji-min] So I'm really conflicted.

590
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:06,536
What's wrong?

591
00:29:07,787 --> 00:29:09,038
You look like a sad duck.

592
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:11,958
You must be really upset about something.

593
00:29:12,625 --> 00:29:13,460
[sighs]

594
00:29:13,543 --> 00:29:14,919
My graduation…

595
00:29:16,504 --> 00:29:17,422
Graduation…

596
00:29:17,505 --> 00:29:19,007
So you can't go, Ji-min,

597
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:22,343
-whether it's Busan or Gyeongju? -[Ji-min] Me?

598
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:25,847
It's 50/50 for me. Should I go to my graduation or not?

599
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:27,056
[chuckles]

600
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:29,934
[Ji-min] If I get the Busan trip, I won't go to my graduation.

601
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:33,062
Where should I sit? I'm just going to stay here.

602
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:34,898
[Ji-min] Want to go upstairs?

603
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:38,902
[Ji-min exhales] So I've given this a lot of thought.

604
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:41,654
I really thought about it a lot.

605
00:29:41,738 --> 00:29:44,324
Ji-woo and I had a serious conversation, right?

606
00:29:44,407 --> 00:29:45,492
When I asked Ji-woo,

607
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:47,786
"If I asked you out on a date, would you go?"

608
00:29:48,828 --> 00:29:50,330
Ji-woo said she would go.

609
00:29:50,413 --> 00:29:53,124
So I kept thinking about it.

610
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:56,961
But, uh, I wanna go with you.

611
00:29:58,922 --> 00:30:00,340
[Ye-rin] With me? [chuckles]

612
00:30:00,423 --> 00:30:01,716
-[gasps] -[Ji-eun] Oh!

613
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,092
Oh!

614
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:04,344
-[gasps] -[Su-hyun] Just go.

615
00:30:04,427 --> 00:30:05,428
Yeah, go, go.

616
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:07,972
But, uh, I wanna go with you.

617
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:10,558
-[Ye-rin] With me? [chuckles] -Yeah.

618
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:13,853
If I asked you out on a date, would you go with me?

619
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:17,065
-Oh, of course. -You'd go?

620
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:20,068
Honestly, I like you the most right now.

621
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:21,986
[Ye-rin cries]

622
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:23,238
[in Korean] Yeah, so…

623
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:27,242
-[in English] Why are you crying? -I'm crying.

624
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:31,246
Don't cry.

625
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:33,873
I'm going with you.

626
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:36,334
[Ye-rin] I swear I saw some tissues around here.

627
00:30:48,638 --> 00:30:50,348
[sobbing]

628
00:30:51,724 --> 00:30:53,476
Why are you crying? Here, sit down.

629
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:55,520
Are you okay?

630
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:57,272
Why are you crying?

631
00:30:58,022 --> 00:30:59,232
I don't know.

632
00:30:59,315 --> 00:31:01,317
-[Ji-min] Hm? -[sniffles] I don't know.

633
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:02,694
[sobs]

634
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:07,740
Cry all you want. You can cry.

635
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:11,744
Cry all you want. We can talk when you feel calmer.

636
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:17,709
-That's the importance of timing. -Well, that's the importance of timing.

637
00:31:22,088 --> 00:31:23,131
[Ye-rin sniffles]

638
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:24,549
[women laughing]

639
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:27,427
-[Ye-rin cries] -Don't cry.

640
00:31:30,096 --> 00:31:31,681
Upstairs, upstairs.

641
00:31:32,765 --> 00:31:33,850
Don't come up.

642
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:35,768
-Are you talking up there? -Go back down.

643
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:37,103
-Right there? -Don't come up.

644
00:31:37,186 --> 00:31:38,062
[Seo-hyeon] Really?

645
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:39,397
Good job. Good job.

646
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,232
[Se-woon and Su-hyun] Wow, Ji-min.

647
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:43,735
-This is a highlight. A highlight. -"Don't come up."

648
00:31:43,818 --> 00:31:44,944
-So cool. -"Don't come up!"

649
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:47,614
-[all] Don't come up! -[all laughing]

650
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:52,952
Are you okay with going to Gyeongju?

651
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:54,370
You okay with Gyeongju?

652
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:56,706
-I'm fine with Gyeongju. -[Ji-min] That's okay.

653
00:31:56,789 --> 00:31:59,792
Could… you tell me why you cried?

654
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:01,461
-Why I cried? -[Ji-min] Mm.

655
00:32:02,503 --> 00:32:06,257
I guess I've been feeling all sorts of different emotions after coming here.

656
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:10,053
I felt emotions that I never really felt before.

657
00:32:10,136 --> 00:32:12,889
You know what I mean, right? You need to think about it.

658
00:32:14,849 --> 00:32:17,685
-It's like-- -So you suddenly felt less tense?

659
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:20,438
I did feel less tense.

660
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:24,817
Yeah. I felt bad, but also thankful.

661
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:28,112
-What do you feel bad about? -Acting like this.

662
00:32:29,822 --> 00:32:31,324
[sniffles]

663
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:34,243
Did you think that I would ask Ji-woo out?

664
00:32:36,829 --> 00:32:41,459
Uh, I thought you might, because…

665
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:44,879
Honestly, when we were on our date,

666
00:32:45,838 --> 00:32:47,256
we felt more like friends.

667
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:52,387
I didn't really think that your feelings would change in such a short time.

668
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:55,264
That it'd be so easy for you to…

669
00:32:58,017 --> 00:32:59,602
-Mm. -I like you more.

670
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:04,399
But you've never been on a date with Ji-woo.

671
00:33:05,066 --> 00:33:06,484
Are you okay with not going?

672
00:33:07,443 --> 00:33:09,070
It's okay if I don't go.

673
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:11,823
Going with you is more fun.

674
00:33:14,033 --> 00:33:16,703
That's why I'm asking you out.

675
00:33:17,453 --> 00:33:19,914
If you use your dream date on me, though,

676
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:23,626
I can't use mine on you. You know that, right?

677
00:33:24,377 --> 00:33:25,378
That's okay.

678
00:33:26,629 --> 00:33:30,133
I trust that you won't suddenly change your mind after your dream date.

679
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:37,348
You're so cool. Ji-min. You're so cool.

680
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:39,559
I totally trust you.

681
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:43,855
YE-RIN

682
00:33:43,938 --> 00:33:46,357
I felt so guilty and thankful at the same time.

683
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:49,027
At that point,

684
00:33:50,153 --> 00:33:52,780
I was thinking about Pyeong-seok and Se-yeon more.

685
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:58,911
So I wasn't completely sure how I felt towards Ji-min.

686
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:04,959
But in that situation, I ended up being able to

687
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:08,588
to sort out my true feelings and I started liking Ji-min a lot more.

688
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:11,883
-Timing is so important in love. -Perfect timing.

689
00:34:11,966 --> 00:34:14,635
-[Se-woon] Totally. -You know, Ji-min fell hard for Ye-rin

690
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:17,722
-after going on that date with her. -Totally, totally.

691
00:34:17,805 --> 00:34:20,058
I think Ji-min made up his mind.

692
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:22,685
-In the beginning, it was Seo-yeong. -[Kyuhyun] Right.

693
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:24,479
Then it was Ji-woo.

694
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:27,607
And now, it's Ye-rin. Maybe I shouldn't list them.

695
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:29,317
-You can't list them. -I shouldn't.

696
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,360
Ji-min is going through all the girls.

697
00:34:31,444 --> 00:34:33,154
He's talking with different people.

698
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:35,907
-He's being super bold. -Yeah, Ji-min is the boldest one.

699
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:39,660
Ji-min felt really comforted by Ye-rin, too.

700
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:43,164
When Ji-min had a hard time, Ye-rin came to him.

701
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:45,500
-He felt comforted by her. -She asked him out.

702
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:48,669
And this time, Ye-rin was having a rough time.

703
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:50,797
Ji-min comforted her.

704
00:34:51,547 --> 00:34:52,924
I hope things work out for them.

705
00:34:53,007 --> 00:34:55,843
They can comfort each other. They can support each other.

706
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:59,222
[Jung-yun] Could you do everything in one day?

707
00:34:59,305 --> 00:35:00,306
[chuckles] One day.

708
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:03,017
I don't think so.

709
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:05,853
If we leave at 6:00, we'll get there at 11:00.

710
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:08,940
-After we get on the thing and get ready-- -Arrive at 11:00.

711
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:10,775
Have dinner there--

712
00:35:10,858 --> 00:35:12,735
You'll be out almost 24 hours, all day.

713
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:15,780
-When you get back, it's basically-- -Around 4:00 in the morning.

714
00:35:15,863 --> 00:35:19,367
Maybe early morning. Is it okay if we can't get up the next day?

715
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:22,370
[Seo-hyeon sighs] I'm really bad at waking up.

716
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:27,291
-Same here, I'm not too confident. -I really don't think that I can get up.

717
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:30,753
-For me, even getting up at 9:00 is tough. -[Jung-yun] Oh, same.

718
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:33,673
-Today I-- -Wait, let's talk somewhere more private.

719
00:35:33,756 --> 00:35:35,550
-[Jung-yun] Private? -[Seo-hyeon laughs]

720
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:37,760
Ugh, this feels way too public.

721
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:41,180
-[Sang-won] Oh, I feel guilty. -This is fun.

722
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:43,516
All right.

723
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:46,477
[Jung-yun clears throat]

724
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:48,104
[Seo-hyeon] All right.

725
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:52,692
-Can you do it or not? -[Jung-yun] Huh?

726
00:35:52,775 --> 00:35:54,861
-Going. -[Jung-yun] I can do it if I want to.

727
00:35:55,611 --> 00:35:57,530
-But you? -[Seo-hyeon] I can't do it.

728
00:35:57,613 --> 00:36:00,533
You can't? If you can't do it, then we can't go.

729
00:36:00,616 --> 00:36:01,659
[Seo-hyeon] Well…

730
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:04,287
We still have to go out tomorrow.

731
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:06,747
Let's go on a casual date. Yeah.

732
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:09,500
-[Jung-yun] That's more relaxing. -[Seo-hyeon] Right?

733
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:11,961
-It might actually be more fun. -[Jung-yun] Right.

734
00:36:13,045 --> 00:36:14,005
[Sang-won sighs]

735
00:36:14,088 --> 00:36:16,257
-[Seo-yeong] How do you feel? -I'm thinking,

736
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:19,177
but it's not like I can do anything about it.

737
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:23,598
I mean, I can't just tell her not to go.

738
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:24,849
-Right. -[grunts softly]

739
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:28,853
You look like you feel really upset, that's all.

740
00:36:28,936 --> 00:36:31,439
Oh, of course I feel upset. So…

741
00:36:32,106 --> 00:36:35,401
Here's the thing. I've been asking Seo-hyeon to go out, right?

742
00:36:35,484 --> 00:36:37,737
But Seo-hyeon has never asked me out.

743
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:40,740
But this time? This time Seo-hyeon asked him out first.

744
00:36:40,823 --> 00:36:42,617
So I do feel hurt.

745
00:36:44,493 --> 00:36:47,496
Well, it makes sense. She needs to use her dream date ticket.

746
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:49,624
It makes perfect sense. [sighs]

747
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:53,002
Yeah, can't do much about it.

748
00:36:53,085 --> 00:36:55,379
[indistinct chatter]

749
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:01,802
One second.

750
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,472
-Where are you going? -One second.

751
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:12,438
[voice breaking] Jung-yun seemed super interested in the dream date.

752
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:16,776
He was sitting up front, too.

753
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:20,071
Jung-yun said all that stuff to me.

754
00:37:20,154 --> 00:37:23,074
So, I was sure he'd take me on the dream date, but then…

755
00:37:24,116 --> 00:37:25,743
But he's going with Seo-hyeon.

756
00:37:25,826 --> 00:37:26,702
[sobs quietly]

757
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:33,626
He's never done that with me. [sniffles]

758
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:50,643
The two of them talked today.

759
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:53,521
-So, Seo-hyeon-- Yeah. -Seo-hyeon?

760
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:56,232
Seo-hyeon asked Jung-yun to talk.

761
00:37:56,315 --> 00:37:57,900
I think Seo-hyeon asked him.

762
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:02,238
She asked him out on a dream date first, so…

763
00:38:05,741 --> 00:38:07,910
[sighs]

764
00:38:15,334 --> 00:38:17,253
Oh, did Se-yeon see it?

765
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:19,588
Oh, Se-yeon must be feeling so conflicted.

766
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:22,842
[sighs]

767
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:34,145
[Se-yeon] What? What's wrong?

768
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:37,606
[Se-yeon sighs]

769
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:39,567
[Ji-woo] I don't wanna go anymore.

770
00:38:41,193 --> 00:38:42,820
[Se-yeon] Why are you crying?

771
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:48,159
[sighs in exasperation]

772
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:52,079
SE-YEON

773
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:54,582
When I saw Ji-woo crying right there,

774
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:57,376
I was so startled.

775
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:00,880
We had a nice date, right before, and then

776
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:06,135
to see her, um… crying like that,

777
00:39:07,136 --> 00:39:08,596
because of what Jung-yun did,

778
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:14,810
I thought, "So, Jung-yun and Ji-woo had something serious going on."

779
00:39:24,278 --> 00:39:26,405
-What? What, what? -[Jung-yun] Huh?

780
00:39:27,114 --> 00:39:29,909
-Can we talk? -[Ji-woo] No, huh? Okay.

781
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:35,081
-So, I was planning on talking to you. -Yeah, go ahead.

782
00:39:35,164 --> 00:39:38,334
You said you're going out with Ji-min tomorrow, right?

783
00:39:39,001 --> 00:39:40,961
-[Ji-woo] I don't know. -You don't know?

784
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:42,338
So…

785
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:45,508
-I don't care. -Oh, it's not about that.

786
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:48,636
-That's why I agreed to go. -You can go. Yeah.

787
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:51,222
Well, since I didn't have any plans for tomorrow…

788
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:55,601
-[Ji-woo] Go. You can go. -And… Huh?

789
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:58,229
-Okay, so-- -Yeah.

790
00:39:58,312 --> 00:40:00,856
It's totally fine. Of course you should go.

791
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,566
You should go if it's Busan.

792
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:04,610
-I'm not going. -Go if it's Gyeongju.

793
00:40:04,693 --> 00:40:05,528
We won't go…

794
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:08,322
You should go on a casual date, at least.

795
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:11,075
-I know you're bored. -[chuckles] "I know you're bored."

796
00:40:12,034 --> 00:40:12,868
Sit.

797
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:16,247
-Sit. -Okay.

798
00:40:18,874 --> 00:40:20,376
It's not what you think.

799
00:40:20,459 --> 00:40:23,254
I'm fine. Why are you telling me this, though?

800
00:40:24,171 --> 00:40:26,173
-Can't I tell you about it? -[Ji-woo] No.

801
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:28,300
-I can't? -[Ji-woo] Yeah.

802
00:40:28,384 --> 00:40:31,762
Because… I'm kind of upset.

803
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:37,309
Oh, I'm gonna cry. You're gonna make me cry.

804
00:40:37,393 --> 00:40:40,062
-Wait! Hold on, come here. -Ugh, so annoying!

805
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:41,605
Where are you going?

806
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:43,607
I don't want… Just give me a second.

807
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:45,693
-You don't wanna talk? -No.

808
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:47,736
-Oh, come on. -I'm not gonna talk.

809
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:48,654
Oh!

810
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:52,491
Ugh, where is she going?

811
00:40:53,826 --> 00:40:56,412
-[indistinct conversation] -[Ji-woo groans]

812
00:41:03,419 --> 00:41:06,422
[Ji-woo sniffles]

813
00:41:06,505 --> 00:41:07,381
[door locks]

814
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:09,175
[Ji-woo sniffles]

815
00:41:14,096 --> 00:41:15,222
[chuckles]

816
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:21,187
[in Korean] Everything's messed up.

817
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:24,857
[Pyeong-seok, in English] I think both will get taken, right?

818
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:27,610
[Hee-ji] Seo-hyeon and Jung-yun.

819
00:41:27,693 --> 00:41:30,821
I wonder… I wonder what Jung-yun is thinking.

820
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:36,535
Let's do that.

821
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:39,997
I'm gonna go and comfort Ji-woo.

822
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,624
[Pyeong-seok clears throat]

823
00:41:48,464 --> 00:41:50,090
[Hee-ji groans softly]

824
00:41:50,716 --> 00:41:52,176
-Take me back home. -What?

825
00:41:52,259 --> 00:41:54,428
-I don't feel good. -Why?

826
00:41:55,262 --> 00:41:58,307
I feel like they're just playing with me.

827
00:42:00,809 --> 00:42:03,312
-They're just playing. -[Hee-ji] What do you mean?

828
00:42:04,104 --> 00:42:05,481
-Hm? -[Ji-woo sniffles]

829
00:42:07,274 --> 00:42:11,278
I mean, he shouldn't have made me think that he liked me.

830
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:12,196
[chuckles]

831
00:42:12,738 --> 00:42:13,906
It's messed up.

832
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:18,494
I came here to have fun. How dare he play with my emotions?

833
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:22,039
They're all toying with me. [sniffles]

834
00:42:22,122 --> 00:42:22,957
[chuckles]

835
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:27,545
[Hee-ji sighs]

836
00:42:29,338 --> 00:42:30,172
Yeah.

837
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:33,467
If I were him,

838
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:38,597
I totally would have said, "Let's go together."

839
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:41,809
Jung-yun came to me and kind of tried to explain himself.

840
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:44,520
[Hee-ji] What? What? What did he say?

841
00:42:44,603 --> 00:42:47,940
I don't know. He said they agreed to go, so they were going,

842
00:42:48,023 --> 00:42:49,650
but they're not going anymore.

843
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:54,029
They were going to go on a casual date, but they're not going on a dream date.

844
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:58,659
Why would he tell me that? That's not why I feel so hurt.

845
00:43:05,791 --> 00:43:07,001
What am I doing?

846
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:08,335
[both laugh]

847
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:11,005
Why am I doing… What am I doing here?

848
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:15,134
All my makeup has gone now. I think I'll just go to bed.

849
00:43:15,217 --> 00:43:17,511
[both giggling]

850
00:43:23,183 --> 00:43:24,560
-Are you guys gonna go? -No.

851
00:43:24,643 --> 00:43:25,519
[Ji-woo] Not yet?

852
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:26,770
We're not going.

853
00:43:27,646 --> 00:43:31,483
-I think Ye-rin is going with Ji-min. -Yeah, that was mutual.

854
00:43:31,567 --> 00:43:33,277
[sighs] So…

855
00:43:34,528 --> 00:43:36,905
You know, I don't understand Jung-yun.

856
00:43:38,198 --> 00:43:40,409
I don't even wanna expect anything from him,

857
00:43:40,492 --> 00:43:41,702
from this point on.

858
00:43:43,704 --> 00:43:46,040
That's all it took for her to change her mind?

859
00:43:46,123 --> 00:43:49,126
That's probably not it. She's just emotional right now.

860
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:51,754
[Kyuhyun] Okay, now, Ji-woo… Uh…

861
00:43:51,837 --> 00:43:54,006
Have you ever seen somebody who cries

862
00:43:54,089 --> 00:43:55,716
-so cutely? -No, never.

863
00:43:55,799 --> 00:43:57,426
That's good. Perfect impression.

864
00:43:57,509 --> 00:43:59,053
She was crying just like that.

865
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:02,598
Oh, and Hee-ji comforted her a lot, too.

866
00:44:02,681 --> 00:44:05,225
-This is what I think… -He's not acting interested.

867
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:07,978
…she really wanted Jung-yun to act that way with her.

868
00:44:08,729 --> 00:44:11,398
-But he did that for another girl. -[Ji-eun] Exactly.

869
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:13,692
-That's why she's so hurt. -[Se-woon] Right.

870
00:44:13,776 --> 00:44:16,570
Honestly, I bet she's never felt this jealous before.

871
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:19,281
Because she's there. She's feeling so jealous.

872
00:44:19,365 --> 00:44:22,951
I don't think she can accept the fact that she's being jealous.

873
00:44:23,035 --> 00:44:25,704
That's why she's still a bit clumsy expressing herself.

874
00:44:25,788 --> 00:44:28,207
-[Kyuhyun] Her first time being jealous. -First time.

875
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:29,833
-[Su-hyun] Wow, yeah. -This is crazy.

876
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:31,335
There's a storm brewing.

877
00:44:31,418 --> 00:44:33,879
Wow, I didn't expect this whirlwind of emotions.

878
00:44:33,962 --> 00:44:36,590
If we're reacting like this, imagine their feelings.

879
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:38,300
[Sang-won] Why was Ye-rin crying?

880
00:44:38,384 --> 00:44:39,426
[Pyeong-seok] She was?

881
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:41,178
[Sang-won] Her eyes were red.

882
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:44,473
I think she cried because she was so relieved.

883
00:44:44,556 --> 00:44:47,059
She started crying after I asked her out.

884
00:44:47,142 --> 00:44:49,561
So, Ye-rin and I are going on a date.

885
00:44:49,645 --> 00:44:51,897
-[Pyeong-seok] Tomorrow? -[Ji-min] I'm going.

886
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:53,857
I'm giving up my graduation.

887
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:56,860
-[Jung-yun] What? -[Ji-min] I wanna go all in.

888
00:44:56,944 --> 00:44:59,196
[Ji-min] I wanna go all in for Ye-rin.

889
00:44:59,279 --> 00:45:02,616
-[Jung-yun] You're not going? -[Ji-min] I'm not going with Ji-woo.

890
00:45:08,705 --> 00:45:10,457
[Jung-yun] This is the worst.

891
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:12,084
[Ji-min] What happened?

892
00:45:12,167 --> 00:45:15,295
I seriously have no idea. Why did you and Seo-hyeon…

893
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:18,549
I don't have any plans tomorrow, so I was, like, "Sure."

894
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:20,300
That's what I said.

895
00:45:21,427 --> 00:45:22,594
That's what happened.

896
00:45:23,303 --> 00:45:25,180
Ji-woo also graduates tomorrow, too.

897
00:45:25,264 --> 00:45:27,141
It's not tomorrow. It was on the 6th.

898
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:28,142
-Oh, really? -Yeah.

899
00:45:28,225 --> 00:45:30,602
I think Ji-woo should be free tomorrow.

900
00:45:30,686 --> 00:45:33,564
I had no idea. I seriously had no idea.

901
00:45:33,647 --> 00:45:36,150
Oh, well, uh… Yeah, right. I mean…

902
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:39,278
[Se-yeon] Oh! Honestly, when I think about all of this…

903
00:45:39,361 --> 00:45:41,905
-My head-- -[Sang-won] You should be selfish now.

904
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:44,366
You should be following your heart right now.

905
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:47,870
[Sang-won] Why be considerate of other people? You should be selfish.

906
00:45:47,953 --> 00:45:51,081
Honestly, Ye-rin and I were talking,

907
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:54,460
one to two minutes before the thing was revealed.

908
00:45:55,294 --> 00:45:56,962
-[Sang-won] I saw. -[Se-yeon] Ugh.

909
00:45:57,045 --> 00:45:58,088
What did you say?

910
00:45:59,631 --> 00:46:02,342
Ye-rin also… [sighs]

911
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:04,928
I don't know if I should say, since Ji-min's here.

912
00:46:05,012 --> 00:46:07,764
-I don't mind. Just be honest. -Ye-rin told me

913
00:46:08,557 --> 00:46:10,684
that she feels hurt, too.

914
00:46:11,727 --> 00:46:15,189
But I didn't say a lot to her, because I don't know how I feel yet.

915
00:46:15,898 --> 00:46:17,858
So I kind of gave ambiguous answers.

916
00:46:18,734 --> 00:46:21,069
Well, look, she's going with Ji-min now.

917
00:46:21,862 --> 00:46:24,615
JI-MIN

918
00:46:24,698 --> 00:46:26,033
I was just confused.

919
00:46:27,826 --> 00:46:28,827
I was confused.

920
00:46:32,372 --> 00:46:34,583
[Pyeong-seok] This is, "We need to talk."

921
00:46:34,666 --> 00:46:36,585
[Sang-won] Who do you need to talk to?

922
00:46:36,668 --> 00:46:38,795
Uh, I went on a date with Ye-rin, right?

923
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:42,299
She asked me to go on a dream date with her.

924
00:46:42,382 --> 00:46:45,260
[Jung-yun] Did you say yes? You said that? You said yes?

925
00:46:45,344 --> 00:46:47,846
I said she should think about it some more.

926
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:50,390
That shouldn't be a rash decision.

927
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:02,611
[exhales heavily]

928
00:47:14,289 --> 00:47:16,750
[breathes deeply]

929
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:25,425
How do you feel now?

930
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:27,511
[sighs]

931
00:47:29,346 --> 00:47:32,391
I kind of wanted to know why she apologized to me.

932
00:47:33,225 --> 00:47:35,644
-Ye-rin apologized to me. -Ye-rin?

933
00:47:35,727 --> 00:47:36,562
-Yeah. -Okay.

934
00:47:36,645 --> 00:47:39,481
She apologized and cried when I asked her to go with me.

935
00:47:39,565 --> 00:47:42,025
-I think I know why she apologized. -Why?

936
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:44,528
Uh, she talked to you, too.

937
00:47:44,611 --> 00:47:47,573
And she asked Pyeong-seok out on a dream date, too.

938
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:52,411
When I heard that she did all that stuff, I felt betrayed.

939
00:47:52,494 --> 00:47:53,328
Hm.

940
00:47:54,871 --> 00:47:59,710
I made my feelings clear to her. But after talking to you guys, I…

941
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:04,506
[chuckles]

942
00:48:06,842 --> 00:48:07,801
-[Se-woon] Oh. -Wow.

943
00:48:07,884 --> 00:48:10,470
-It's driving me crazy. -[Ji-eun] It's like a TV show.

944
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:13,307
-[Su-hyun] This isn't good. -Ji-min is the sad duck now.

945
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:16,476
-[Ji-eun laughs] -He said that he felt betrayed.

946
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:20,647
Uh, what do you think? Since you're in the same position?

947
00:48:21,273 --> 00:48:23,108
-Same position? -[Su-hyun] As a guy.

948
00:48:23,191 --> 00:48:25,360
I'm not really in the same position.

949
00:48:25,444 --> 00:48:27,821
-[Su-hyun] Would you feel betrayed? -I think…

950
00:48:27,904 --> 00:48:29,948
-[Kyuhyun] No. -I might feel betrayed.

951
00:48:30,032 --> 00:48:31,783
-[Kyuhyun] Really? -[Se-woon] He went there

952
00:48:31,867 --> 00:48:33,952
thinking that he was going to go all in.

953
00:48:34,953 --> 00:48:37,497
But he found out Ye-rin had asked those other guys

954
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:38,582
out on a dream date.

955
00:48:38,665 --> 00:48:41,585
It's been 30 minutes since he said he wanted to go all in.

956
00:48:42,377 --> 00:48:44,129
Basically, they're going at…

957
00:48:44,212 --> 00:48:47,591
I think Ji-min is going faster. They're going at two different speeds.

958
00:48:47,674 --> 00:48:50,344
It's like Pandora's box. You don't need to know.

959
00:48:50,427 --> 00:48:51,762
It's better if you don't.

960
00:48:51,845 --> 00:48:53,639
But he didn't hear it from Ye-rin.

961
00:48:54,598 --> 00:48:57,059
Uh, he heard about it through his friends.

962
00:48:57,893 --> 00:49:00,062
[Kyuhyun] I hope things don't go wrong.

963
00:49:00,145 --> 00:49:02,731
They'd understand each other if they went on a date.

964
00:49:02,814 --> 00:49:04,858
In his heart, Ye-rin is his number one.

965
00:49:04,941 --> 00:49:06,652
[sighs] I feel so bad for them.

966
00:49:06,735 --> 00:49:09,112
Why is all of this happening over a dream date?

967
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:11,990
[indistinct chatter]

968
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:16,244
[Ji-min] Oh, man. Oh, man.

969
00:49:17,037 --> 00:49:17,871
[sighs]

970
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:22,334
[sighs]

971
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:28,674
Okay. I've made up my mind.

972
00:49:28,757 --> 00:49:30,509
[Se-yeon] Oh, you have?

973
00:49:30,592 --> 00:49:31,802
I'm gonna

974
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:34,012
use her date ticket.

975
00:49:35,681 --> 00:49:37,140
I'm not gonna use mine.

976
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:39,267
[Se-yeon] Use Ye-rin's date ticket?

977
00:49:39,351 --> 00:49:42,813
-Oh? What? -[Su-hyun] Oh, he's gonna use

978
00:49:42,896 --> 00:49:44,231
-Ye-rin's date ticket. -What?

979
00:49:44,314 --> 00:49:45,148
[laughing]

980
00:49:45,232 --> 00:49:47,192
-Could you rewind that? -What the heck?

981
00:49:47,275 --> 00:49:49,695
-What did he say? -I just doubted my own ears.

982
00:49:49,778 --> 00:49:51,446
I just doubted my eyes and ears.

983
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:54,658
-[Se-woon] I didn't hear that right. -[Ji-eun] Rewind the clip.

984
00:49:54,741 --> 00:49:56,201
I'm gonna

985
00:49:57,327 --> 00:49:58,495
use her date ticket.

986
00:49:59,996 --> 00:50:01,373
I'm not gonna use mine.

987
00:50:01,456 --> 00:50:02,916
He won't use his.

988
00:50:02,999 --> 00:50:04,626
-Her's. -Her date ticket.

989
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:06,920
[Ji-eun] "I'm going to use her date ticket."

990
00:50:07,003 --> 00:50:09,798
-Don't do that! -So he's gonna make Ye-rin use her…

991
00:50:09,881 --> 00:50:12,342
Ye-rin wanted to use her ticket on other guys.

992
00:50:12,426 --> 00:50:13,927
"I'll make her use it on me."

993
00:50:14,010 --> 00:50:16,096
So she can't go with anybody else?

994
00:50:16,179 --> 00:50:18,598
Ji-min went all in, and he was open with his feelings.

995
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:21,768
I think he wants Ye-rin to express her feelings, too.

996
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:23,520
-Just as much as he did. -Right.

997
00:50:24,062 --> 00:50:27,315
[Se-yeon] Oh. Ugh. Hey, hey. Why do I feel so frustrated?

998
00:50:27,399 --> 00:50:29,025
[Jung-yun] You wanna go with Ji-woo?

999
00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:31,445
-Yeah, but she-- -Then tell her you don't wanna go.

1000
00:50:31,528 --> 00:50:34,197
Because she's always had something, so I…

1001
00:50:34,281 --> 00:50:36,658
-Say you don't wanna go. -She keeps having dates.

1002
00:50:36,742 --> 00:50:38,577
And I can't be like, "Don't go out."

1003
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:40,036
-[Ji-min] Yeah. -[sighs]

1004
00:50:40,746 --> 00:50:41,788
Seriously.

1005
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:44,332
[Jung-yun] Ugh, this is painful. It's painful.

1006
00:50:44,416 --> 00:50:47,169
[Ji-min sighs] What's going on?

1007
00:50:53,925 --> 00:50:55,635
-Where's Se-yeon? -[Jung-yun] I think

1008
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:57,929
-he went outside for a minute. -Outside?

1009
00:50:58,013 --> 00:50:59,306
And where's Ji-woo?

1010
00:50:59,389 --> 00:51:01,516
-[Jung-yun] Can't find her. -[Ye-rin] You upset?

1011
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:04,895
Ye-rin. Let's go upstairs.

1012
00:51:05,437 --> 00:51:07,522
-Is she in her room? -[Ye-rin] I don't know.

1013
00:51:13,153 --> 00:51:15,739
Uh, I have a question.

1014
00:51:15,822 --> 00:51:18,533
Did you ask Pyeong-seok out on a dream date?

1015
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:21,161
Yeah, yesterday.

1016
00:51:22,621 --> 00:51:24,915
Did you ask Se-yeon if he felt jealous?

1017
00:51:27,375 --> 00:51:28,376
Se-yeon?

1018
00:51:31,254 --> 00:51:33,256
Yeah, I did. Earlier.

1019
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:37,177
I'm not going to use my date ticket.

1020
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:38,261
Why?

1021
00:51:39,054 --> 00:51:40,263
I'm really disappointed.

1022
00:51:40,347 --> 00:51:41,515
[sighs]

1023
00:51:42,682 --> 00:51:45,060
[Ji-min] If we're going, we're using your ticket.

1024
00:51:48,522 --> 00:51:50,857
Actually, when I told you that I felt bad.

1025
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:53,109
-Yeah, I know. -That's what it was.

1026
00:51:53,193 --> 00:51:54,736
I figured that out right away.

1027
00:51:58,281 --> 00:51:59,866
But I'll go on the date…

1028
00:52:02,202 --> 00:52:04,120
if you use your ticket.

1029
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:09,459
[Ji-min sighs]

1030
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:15,131
Wow, just ten minutes ago, they were sitting there,

1031
00:52:15,215 --> 00:52:17,467
-and they were so happy. -It was like a movie.

1032
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:20,720
Wait.

1033
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:25,851
I said that to Pyeong-seok before I went on a date with you.

1034
00:52:25,934 --> 00:52:27,310
When did you say that?

1035
00:52:27,394 --> 00:52:29,980
I told Pyeong-seok that before I went on a date with you.

1036
00:52:30,063 --> 00:52:32,065
You asked him out on a dream date?

1037
00:52:32,774 --> 00:52:34,317
I said that because

1038
00:52:35,235 --> 00:52:36,862
I was feeling really conflicted,

1039
00:52:36,945 --> 00:52:40,949
so I was like, "Let's stop taking everything so seriously."

1040
00:52:41,032 --> 00:52:42,659
"Even with the dream date,

1041
00:52:42,742 --> 00:52:45,787
it wouldn't be so bad to go with somebody I want to get to know better,

1042
00:52:45,871 --> 00:52:48,206
instead of the person I actually like."

1043
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:51,459
"Let's just go on all the dates." That's how I was thinking about it.

1044
00:52:51,543 --> 00:52:54,129
That's being inconsiderate to the other person.

1045
00:52:54,212 --> 00:52:57,465
Honestly, though, I didn't want to be considerate.

1046
00:52:59,092 --> 00:53:00,677
I don't want to be.

1047
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:03,221
I think I've been considerate enough.

1048
00:53:03,847 --> 00:53:05,557
That's why it's been tough for me.

1049
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:07,267
So I'm not going to do it.

1050
00:53:09,227 --> 00:53:11,563
[Ji-min] I've been thinking a lot about this.

1051
00:53:11,646 --> 00:53:14,816
When I heard that stuff, I kind of got angry at you.

1052
00:53:16,318 --> 00:53:17,736
I got angry at Se-yeon, too.

1053
00:53:22,616 --> 00:53:25,952
I just felt like you came to me after going through everybody else.

1054
00:53:27,746 --> 00:53:30,916
Try putting yourself in my shoes. I bet you'd feel the same way.

1055
00:53:33,209 --> 00:53:35,712
Well, when you approached me first…

1056
00:53:36,671 --> 00:53:40,342
I thought you would probably start liking Ji-woo more than me.

1057
00:53:42,594 --> 00:53:44,012
But I thought,

1058
00:53:44,763 --> 00:53:48,558
"Maybe I can rely on Ji-min a bit" after you told me all that stuff.

1059
00:53:50,352 --> 00:53:54,397
If I'm being honest, that really helped me come to terms with my feelings.

1060
00:53:54,481 --> 00:53:58,193
I also don't want to be with someone who's not sure about me, though.

1061
00:53:58,276 --> 00:54:02,113
And honestly, I don't like people who keep making me worry about them.

1062
00:54:02,197 --> 00:54:03,990
That's why I was mad at Se-yeon.

1063
00:54:04,783 --> 00:54:09,120
But now, you've heard about Pyeong-seok and Se-yeon…

1064
00:54:12,082 --> 00:54:14,209
I don't know. You're being like…

1065
00:54:14,292 --> 00:54:16,169
I don't know what to do here.

1066
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:20,006
I get what you're trying to say.

1067
00:54:20,966 --> 00:54:23,301
I think there's less of a misunderstanding now.

1068
00:54:24,302 --> 00:54:26,388
But if I use my date ticket on you,

1069
00:54:26,471 --> 00:54:28,723
I honestly don't know who you'll use yours on.

1070
00:54:28,807 --> 00:54:31,267
That's why I'm saying that we should use your date ticket.

1071
00:54:31,351 --> 00:54:35,689
The thing is, I'm super confused about my own feelings right now.

1072
00:54:35,772 --> 00:54:39,776
And I don't know why I need to worry about all this stuff while I'm here.

1073
00:54:52,998 --> 00:54:54,416
Well, there's no other way.

1074
00:55:00,005 --> 00:55:02,298
Where are you going? Where are you going?

1075
00:55:02,382 --> 00:55:03,216
Come here.

1076
00:55:04,092 --> 00:55:07,220
Come on. Come here.

1077
00:55:07,303 --> 00:55:08,763
-Hey. -[Ji-min] Seriously.

1078
00:55:08,847 --> 00:55:10,473
[Ye-rin] Oh, don't be like that.

1079
00:55:10,557 --> 00:55:11,766
We're using your ticket.

1080
00:55:13,643 --> 00:55:14,561
[Ye-rin] Don't go.

1081
00:55:14,644 --> 00:55:18,148
I'll go if we use your ticket, but I'm not going if we don't use yours.

1082
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:23,445
Why are you so conflicted about this?

1083
00:55:23,528 --> 00:55:26,823
I'm just conflicted about everything.

1084
00:55:27,449 --> 00:55:29,784
I can't do anything anymore.

1085
00:55:30,910 --> 00:55:33,121
I don't want to make any decisions.

1086
00:55:50,263 --> 00:55:52,182
I don't like you anymore.

1087
00:55:56,227 --> 00:55:57,896
[all exclaiming]

1088
00:55:58,813 --> 00:56:00,356
-Why? -That was so sudden.

1089
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:02,358
-Wow. -[Su-hyun sighs]

1090
00:56:02,442 --> 00:56:03,693
Oh, no.

1091
00:56:03,777 --> 00:56:05,612
-What's going to happen? -[Kyuhyun] It's bad.

1092
00:56:05,695 --> 00:56:07,822
-I really don't know. -It's messed up.

1093
00:56:08,406 --> 00:56:11,659
But Ye-rin was still thinking about it until the end.

1094
00:56:12,952 --> 00:56:16,039
She could have said, "Oh, okay. I'll use my ticket on you."

1095
00:56:16,122 --> 00:56:17,707
So I'm thinking,

1096
00:56:17,791 --> 00:56:22,420
"Why was she so conflicted?"

1097
00:56:22,504 --> 00:56:24,255
I kind of get why she did it, though.

1098
00:56:24,339 --> 00:56:27,634
Ye-rin started liking Ji-min and became more stable

1099
00:56:27,717 --> 00:56:31,554
because he was like, "I definitely like you."

1100
00:56:31,638 --> 00:56:33,139
But now, it's a bit different.

1101
00:56:33,223 --> 00:56:35,517
Now, he's like, "You need to show me that you like me."

1102
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:38,186
-That's a little… -That's kind of… Oh, I get it now.

1103
00:56:38,269 --> 00:56:40,355
She feels like, "Huh? I'm not there yet."

1104
00:56:40,438 --> 00:56:43,900
"I just felt more stable because of how confident you were."

1105
00:56:43,983 --> 00:56:47,028
-I think Ji-min is a very fiery guy. -[Ji-eun] He's fiery.

1106
00:56:47,112 --> 00:56:48,905
He's like a raging flame.

1107
00:56:48,988 --> 00:56:50,949
Ji-min is definitely pretty emotional.

1108
00:56:51,032 --> 00:56:52,450
Right. He's a bit emotional.

1109
00:56:52,534 --> 00:56:54,619
Still, Ye-rin is still holding onto him.

1110
00:56:54,702 --> 00:56:57,747
-[Ji-eun] She's still holding onto him. -[Su-hyun] Right.

1111
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:01,000
Uh…

1112
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:02,085
Have a glass.

1113
00:57:02,961 --> 00:57:03,962
Have a glass.

1114
00:57:04,879 --> 00:57:07,132
They're all thinking about so much.

1115
00:57:08,508 --> 00:57:10,343
I'm not thinking about much, though.

1116
00:57:11,553 --> 00:57:14,556
Maybe it's because I'm only looking in one direction.

1117
00:57:14,639 --> 00:57:16,599
[Hee-ji laughs]

1118
00:57:20,353 --> 00:57:22,063
-Oh… -[Seo-yeong laughs]

1119
00:57:22,147 --> 00:57:23,857
-Did you guys see that? -Seo-yeong.

1120
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:24,774
"Oh, oh."

1121
00:57:24,858 --> 00:57:26,109
[Hee-ji laughs]

1122
00:57:26,776 --> 00:57:29,529
-You two having a private conversation? -No, it's okay.

1123
00:57:29,612 --> 00:57:31,030
Really? It's scary in there.

1124
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:34,117
-Life is just like that, though. -[Seo-yeong] Oh, yeah?

1125
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:35,535
It's not easy.

1126
00:57:35,618 --> 00:57:37,704
So, you know all about life huh, sir?

1127
00:57:39,038 --> 00:57:41,332
Could you guys do something for me?

1128
00:57:41,416 --> 00:57:42,250
[Hee-ji] Sure.

1129
00:57:42,333 --> 00:57:46,421
Please, please stay a happy couple, you two.

1130
00:57:46,504 --> 00:57:48,173
-[Hee-ji chuckles] -Please, okay?

1131
00:57:48,256 --> 00:57:49,632
[Hee-ji] He is happy.

1132
00:57:49,716 --> 00:57:51,843
Look at that smile. He's smiling.

1133
00:57:51,926 --> 00:57:53,845
[laughing]

1134
00:57:55,889 --> 00:57:56,973
[Seo-yeong] So sweet.

1135
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:01,644
Wow, you guys are sweeter than this strawberry milk.

1136
00:58:02,937 --> 00:58:04,647
You guys are so sweet.

1137
00:58:05,523 --> 00:58:06,357
Good times.

1138
00:58:07,275 --> 00:58:08,610
So, why--

1139
00:58:08,693 --> 00:58:10,361
-How Jung-yun was acting… -Yeah?

1140
00:58:10,445 --> 00:58:12,864
…was the only thing that hurt my feelings.

1141
00:58:13,531 --> 00:58:15,158
Yeah? Why?

1142
00:58:15,241 --> 00:58:16,493
-Jung-yun's… -Because…

1143
00:58:17,327 --> 00:58:20,622
I've always said that I want Jung-yun to be more proactive.

1144
00:58:20,705 --> 00:58:22,665
I was hurt because of how Jung-yun acted.

1145
00:58:22,749 --> 00:58:24,626
It wasn't because of you, not at all.

1146
00:58:24,709 --> 00:58:25,543
Yeah.

1147
00:58:25,627 --> 00:58:28,046
Oh, I thought-- Oh!

1148
00:58:28,129 --> 00:58:30,048
I thought it was because of me.

1149
00:58:30,131 --> 00:58:31,174
-I was so-- -Yeah?

1150
00:58:31,841 --> 00:58:33,134
[Se-yeon] Can I come in?

1151
00:58:33,218 --> 00:58:34,511
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1152
00:58:34,594 --> 00:58:36,304
Want me to leave? Should I leave?

1153
00:58:36,387 --> 00:58:38,097
No, I'm asking if I can come in.

1154
00:58:38,181 --> 00:58:39,516
-Are you two alone? -What?

1155
00:58:41,017 --> 00:58:42,018
Why? Why?

1156
00:58:47,815 --> 00:58:49,651
What did you just talk about?

1157
00:58:49,734 --> 00:58:50,944
I want to hear it, too.

1158
00:58:51,027 --> 00:58:54,364
I want to tell you this first, though. I just told you this too.

1159
00:58:54,447 --> 00:58:56,491
I liked the date that I went on with you.

1160
00:58:57,575 --> 00:58:58,576
Hm.

1161
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:01,955
What am I doing here?

1162
00:59:02,038 --> 00:59:04,123
No, you can stay here and talk.

1163
00:59:05,166 --> 00:59:07,835
I guess it was helpful. With my feelings.

1164
00:59:07,919 --> 00:59:09,254
So, I…

1165
00:59:10,672 --> 00:59:11,631
I…

1166
00:59:13,967 --> 00:59:16,344
I know you still have feelings for Jung-yun.

1167
00:59:16,427 --> 00:59:18,012
-I know that. -I told you about it.

1168
00:59:18,096 --> 00:59:20,640
I know that, and I understand. I understand.

1169
00:59:20,723 --> 00:59:23,893
But when you came back from having a great date with me,

1170
00:59:24,978 --> 00:59:28,523
then suddenly started crying because of how Jung-yun was acting…

1171
00:59:28,606 --> 00:59:30,441
-[Ji-woo] I'm sorry. -I felt really--

1172
00:59:30,525 --> 00:59:32,402
-[Seo-hyeon] We talked about that. -Yeah.

1173
00:59:32,485 --> 00:59:34,195
-She feels bad. -It put me in a weird spot.

1174
00:59:34,279 --> 00:59:36,781
I just stepped outside because I had a headache.

1175
00:59:36,864 --> 00:59:38,575
I was on the terrace, and all of a sudden--

1176
00:59:38,658 --> 00:59:40,535
-Our eyes met. -[Se-yeon] You know.

1177
00:59:40,618 --> 00:59:42,829
I was feeling like crap, too!

1178
00:59:42,912 --> 00:59:44,205
[Ji-woo] I'm sorry.

1179
00:59:44,289 --> 00:59:45,623
[Seo-hyeon] I understand.

1180
00:59:46,457 --> 00:59:47,709
[Jung-yun sighs]

1181
00:59:54,048 --> 00:59:56,634
-Hey, where's Ji-woo? -[Seo-yeong] She's right there.

1182
00:59:56,718 --> 00:59:58,386
Go and ask her if you guys can talk.

1183
00:59:58,469 --> 00:59:59,971
Is she downstairs with Seo-hyeon?

1184
01:00:00,763 --> 01:00:02,140
-[Seo-yeong] Se-yeon? -Seo-hyeon.

1185
01:00:02,223 --> 01:00:05,226
-[Seo-yeong] Seo-hyeon is with her. -Are they talking now?

1186
01:00:05,935 --> 01:00:06,769
[sighs]

1187
01:00:12,650 --> 01:00:15,528
Then let's just keep things simple.

1188
01:00:15,612 --> 01:00:17,280
I'm over-thinking.

1189
01:00:17,363 --> 01:00:20,658
-[Seo-hyeon] I also want to stop thinking. -Need to regroup in six minutes.

1190
01:00:20,742 --> 01:00:21,659
[Seo-hyeon sighs]

1191
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:25,330
-[Seo-hyeon] Why can't we just have fun? -I… I…

1192
01:00:25,413 --> 01:00:26,289
Uh…

1193
01:00:27,498 --> 01:00:30,168
Oh, wait. You might be making a hasty decision.

1194
01:00:30,251 --> 01:00:31,753
Think carefully.

1195
01:00:31,836 --> 01:00:33,171
You might regret it later.

1196
01:00:33,755 --> 01:00:35,006
Regret what?

1197
01:00:35,089 --> 01:00:36,924
Did I jump to conclusions again?

1198
01:00:37,008 --> 01:00:38,801
-[Se-yeon] No, you're right. -Am I? Exactly.

1199
01:00:38,885 --> 01:00:40,303
Anywhere?

1200
01:00:40,386 --> 01:00:41,804
Oh, Busan or Gyeongju?

1201
01:00:42,722 --> 01:00:44,849
Whenever there's an empty spot? Okay.

1202
01:00:44,932 --> 01:00:47,101
I don't think we should go out tomorrow.

1203
01:00:47,185 --> 01:00:48,227
Why?

1204
01:00:48,311 --> 01:00:50,521
Things are so messy right now.

1205
01:00:50,605 --> 01:00:51,856
What do you mean "messy"?

1206
01:00:51,939 --> 01:00:56,194
I don't think I'd be able to go out and have fun.

1207
01:00:56,277 --> 01:00:57,570
Don't you think so?

1208
01:00:57,654 --> 01:00:58,488
[Se-yeon sighs]

1209
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:03,534
I'm just thinking about so many things right now.

1210
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:06,621
In a way, I felt more relaxed yesterday.

1211
01:01:06,704 --> 01:01:10,041
Before, I knew that I definitely liked Jung-yun more than you,

1212
01:01:10,750 --> 01:01:13,419
but things are starting to get confusing today.

1213
01:01:14,962 --> 01:01:16,839
[Seo-hyeon] Half and half.

1214
01:01:16,923 --> 01:01:20,468
-Half and half, like coffee? -Yeah, it's like half and half for coffee.

1215
01:01:20,551 --> 01:01:23,054
-It's half and half now? -That's why it's complicated.

1216
01:01:23,137 --> 01:01:25,640
I'll be thinking about you if I go with Jung-yun,

1217
01:01:25,723 --> 01:01:27,975
and I'll think about Jung-yun if I'm with you.

1218
01:01:30,228 --> 01:01:32,980
I don't think I'll be able to have fun.

1219
01:01:34,273 --> 01:01:37,276
-Do what feels comfortable. -[Seo-hyeon] Do what feels good.

1220
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:39,737
Promise me that we'll go on the next date, then.

1221
01:01:44,575 --> 01:01:46,411
Wow, that's so surprising.

1222
01:01:46,494 --> 01:01:48,913
-People these days-- -She's so honest, isn't she?

1223
01:01:48,996 --> 01:01:52,834
People these days say stuff like "I like you, but I like him too."

1224
01:01:52,917 --> 01:01:56,003
Right now, she doesn't know if she likes this guy or that guy.

1225
01:01:56,087 --> 01:01:58,005
But she's confused right now,

1226
01:01:58,089 --> 01:02:00,883
so she's like, "I'm starting to like you a bit more, Se-yeon."

1227
01:02:00,967 --> 01:02:02,927
I think she likes Jung-yun, though.

1228
01:02:03,010 --> 01:02:05,471
-[Kyuhyun] It's Jung-yun. -It's totally Jung-yun.

1229
01:02:05,555 --> 01:02:08,224
She likes Jung-yun a lot, but somebody else is doing the things

1230
01:02:08,307 --> 01:02:10,268
that she wants from him, so she's conflicted.

1231
01:02:10,351 --> 01:02:11,728
That's what she's falling for.

1232
01:02:11,811 --> 01:02:13,354
Why she said half and half.

1233
01:02:13,438 --> 01:02:14,647
But I think it's 80/20.

1234
01:02:15,565 --> 01:02:17,316
It's funny that I'm using a ratio.

1235
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:18,985
It's not half and half.

1236
01:02:19,068 --> 01:02:21,738
She said half and half because he was there.

1237
01:02:21,821 --> 01:02:23,156
Exactly.

1238
01:02:23,239 --> 01:02:27,034
She said "it's half-and-half" on a whim because she felt so disappointed.

1239
01:02:32,039 --> 01:02:33,082
[sighs]

1240
01:02:43,968 --> 01:02:45,470
[in Korean] We're all waiting…

1241
01:02:48,014 --> 01:02:49,932
It was 20%, but now it's 50.

1242
01:02:50,016 --> 01:02:52,477
[in English] Guys, the others are all waiting.

1243
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:53,853
[Se-yeon] Oh, I'm sorry.

1244
01:02:54,896 --> 01:02:55,897
Oh!

1245
01:02:59,275 --> 01:03:03,154
[Sang-won] Well, now that we've talked, we need to go on our dates.

1246
01:03:03,237 --> 01:03:05,114
Raise your hand for the Busan trip.

1247
01:03:05,198 --> 01:03:06,783
[Se-yeon sighs in exasperation]

1248
01:03:16,709 --> 01:03:17,710
[sighs]

1249
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:21,005
[Ye-rin] Does anybody want to go?

1250
01:03:21,088 --> 01:03:23,216
[Seo-yeong] Do any of you guys want to go?

1251
01:03:24,008 --> 01:03:25,426
What about Gyeongju?

1252
01:03:25,510 --> 01:03:27,470
[Seo-yeong] Nobody for Gyeongju?

1253
01:03:31,724 --> 01:03:34,393
Does nobody wanna go, or have you not talked enough?

1254
01:03:34,477 --> 01:03:38,022
Raise your hand if you're like, "I don't have anything, I have nothing."

1255
01:03:38,105 --> 01:03:41,234
You're not even thinking about going on the trip.

1256
01:03:43,528 --> 01:03:44,737
I'm not planning on it.

1257
01:03:45,696 --> 01:03:46,572
[Se-yeon] Really?

1258
01:03:46,656 --> 01:03:49,367
[Sang-won] People who didn't raise their hands don't know yet.

1259
01:03:49,450 --> 01:03:50,618
We need to talk more.

1260
01:03:50,701 --> 01:03:53,329
Go and talk with the person you want to.

1261
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:57,792
If we need to talk, then we should.

1262
01:03:57,875 --> 01:04:00,127
We need to do what it takes. So…

1263
01:04:00,211 --> 01:04:02,755
So, let's do first come, first serve from now on.

1264
01:04:02,839 --> 01:04:05,716
We're not rushing up there. So, first come, first serve.

1265
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:08,469
All of you, grab the person you need to talk to.

1266
01:04:08,553 --> 01:04:10,596
-The person you need now. -Good idea.

1267
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:12,265
That's what we should do.

1268
01:04:20,815 --> 01:04:21,816
Ji-woo.

1269
01:04:22,483 --> 01:04:23,484
Ji-woo.

1270
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:26,153
Ji-woo. Can we talk?

1271
01:04:26,988 --> 01:04:28,281
Oh, my hair roller.

1272
01:04:32,535 --> 01:04:33,870
Where do you want to go?

1273
01:04:33,953 --> 01:04:35,454
Where you want to go.

1274
01:04:52,263 --> 01:04:53,264
[Jung-yun] Hm.

1275
01:04:57,184 --> 01:04:58,019
[Ji-woo] Hm.

1276
01:05:00,354 --> 01:05:01,856
What are you thinking now?

1277
01:05:02,648 --> 01:05:04,066
-Me? -Hm.

1278
01:05:04,150 --> 01:05:06,694
I'm thinking about a lot right now.

1279
01:05:08,362 --> 01:05:09,280
It's a bit…

1280
01:05:10,531 --> 01:05:13,075
[sighs] Can I just tell you what I really think?

1281
01:05:13,159 --> 01:05:14,869
Yeah, that's why we're here.

1282
01:05:15,828 --> 01:05:20,041
You used to be the only one that I had feelings for,

1283
01:05:20,124 --> 01:05:24,337
and I liked you so much more than anybody else.

1284
01:05:25,212 --> 01:05:30,384
And even when Ji-min and Se-yeon said they had feelings for me,

1285
01:05:31,218 --> 01:05:34,263
I was most excited about going on a date with you,

1286
01:05:34,347 --> 01:05:39,226
and I wanted to talk to you the most,

1287
01:05:39,310 --> 01:05:42,480
but you didn't say anything to me.

1288
01:05:42,563 --> 01:05:45,107
[crying] Hold on. Do we have any tissues?

1289
01:05:45,191 --> 01:05:46,525
Do we have any tissues?

1290
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:48,903
[Jung-yun sighs]

1291
01:05:54,867 --> 01:05:56,911
Hm… [in Korean] I get it now.

1292
01:05:59,372 --> 01:06:00,331
[Ji-woo chuckles]

1293
01:06:05,127 --> 01:06:07,171
You didn't say anything to me.

1294
01:06:07,254 --> 01:06:08,881
You know that too, right?

1295
01:06:10,132 --> 01:06:11,884
Let me be honest too.

1296
01:06:13,094 --> 01:06:14,095
Seo-hyeon…

1297
01:06:15,179 --> 01:06:18,599
asked me to go on a date tomorrow.

1298
01:06:19,809 --> 01:06:22,353
So I have lot to think about right now, too.

1299
01:06:22,436 --> 01:06:28,109
You said you had your graduation, and you said you'd go out with Ji-min.

1300
01:06:29,443 --> 01:06:32,029
So I, uh, didn't want to

1301
01:06:32,113 --> 01:06:34,073
-just stay at home all the time. -Right.

1302
01:06:34,156 --> 01:06:37,284
So, when she asked me to go out with her, "Okay, sure."

1303
01:06:37,368 --> 01:06:39,662
I thought, "Yeah, let's just go on a date."

1304
01:06:39,745 --> 01:06:42,790
-I wasn't super serious about it. -Hm. Hm.

1305
01:06:43,541 --> 01:06:44,542
Besides…

1306
01:06:45,835 --> 01:06:48,462
I didn't have anything going on with Seo-hyeon.

1307
01:06:48,546 --> 01:06:50,840
You know, being attracted to her.

1308
01:06:50,923 --> 01:06:53,759
I think that's why I didn't think much about it.

1309
01:06:57,388 --> 01:06:58,389
So, yeah.

1310
01:07:03,352 --> 01:07:09,191
You know, I've been wanting you to be more engaged.

1311
01:07:09,275 --> 01:07:12,611
The way you were acting before the dream date announcement today

1312
01:07:12,695 --> 01:07:15,448
was the most proactive you've ever been.

1313
01:07:15,531 --> 01:07:17,616
You were sitting up front and everything.

1314
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:20,661
Because you were doing that, I was like, "Huh, what's this?"

1315
01:07:20,745 --> 01:07:22,997
But you didn't do it because of me.

1316
01:07:23,581 --> 01:07:24,957
I felt hurt because…

1317
01:07:25,541 --> 01:07:27,209
[chuckles]

1318
01:07:27,293 --> 01:07:30,337
…I saw something that I've been wanting to see…

1319
01:07:33,215 --> 01:07:34,216
for so long.

1320
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:38,721
For the first time today, but it wasn't for me.

1321
01:07:38,804 --> 01:07:40,389
That was the most hurtful part.

1322
01:07:44,685 --> 01:07:46,729
I like you the most, but…

1323
01:07:50,107 --> 01:07:51,108
you…

1324
01:08:02,286 --> 01:08:04,580
You never know if I don't say anything, right?

1325
01:08:04,663 --> 01:08:06,082
Of course you don't know.

1326
01:08:06,832 --> 01:08:10,920
Whenever I want to say something to you,

1327
01:08:11,754 --> 01:08:15,466
I have to think over it, like, five times before I say anything.

1328
01:08:17,635 --> 01:08:20,763
I think that's why I didn't get to tell you things…

1329
01:08:22,264 --> 01:08:23,224
[Ji-woo] Hm?

1330
01:08:23,307 --> 01:08:25,726
-…that you've been wanting to hear. -Hm.

1331
01:08:33,317 --> 01:08:39,907
What I'm saying is, you're the only person here who made…

1332
01:08:42,284 --> 01:08:43,285
my heart

1333
01:08:44,537 --> 01:08:45,538
flutter.

1334
01:08:46,664 --> 01:08:48,499
I wanted to say that yesterday, too.

1335
01:08:48,582 --> 01:08:50,417
Why didn't you say it?

1336
01:08:51,794 --> 01:08:55,131
I felt something that I didn't feel with anybody else.

1337
01:08:56,549 --> 01:08:57,883
Until the end.

1338
01:08:57,967 --> 01:09:00,678
Why are you telling me this now?

1339
01:09:01,178 --> 01:09:03,472
[sighs] This is driving me crazy.

1340
01:09:05,558 --> 01:09:06,976
Uh, you're the only one.

1341
01:09:07,059 --> 01:09:08,686
You've always been the only one.

1342
01:09:08,769 --> 01:09:11,438
That's why I was really happy on the day you arrived.

1343
01:09:16,235 --> 01:09:18,654
I wish you'd told me all of that stuff yesterday.

1344
01:09:22,116 --> 01:09:24,410
I've never felt that way before.

1345
01:09:26,245 --> 01:09:27,246
[Ji-woo sniffles]

1346
01:09:27,329 --> 01:09:31,542
I've never fallen for someone so quickly.

1347
01:09:32,168 --> 01:09:33,002
[sniffles] Hm.

1348
01:09:33,085 --> 01:09:38,382
So I really thought hard about how things will go.

1349
01:09:38,465 --> 01:09:39,717
[Ji-woo] Hm.

1350
01:09:41,260 --> 01:09:44,013
But you… I know I'm a little late.

1351
01:09:44,930 --> 01:09:47,600
People change easily, okay?

1352
01:09:48,475 --> 01:09:50,603
You never know when they'll change their mind.

1353
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:52,813
So, I've changed my mind,

1354
01:09:53,689 --> 01:09:54,815
Jung-yun.

1355
01:09:57,443 --> 01:09:59,445
[closing theme music playing]
