-[Ji-min] How about in here? -Sure. I've never been…

14
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:01,144
-I was here with Ye-rin. -Really?

15
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:02,645
What did you talk about?

16
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:04,522
-I can't tell you. -Oh, sorry.

17
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:07,942
-[chuckling] -Finally, Ji-min.

18
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:11,071
-And so the battle begins. -[Se-woon] Isn't that Se-yeon's bed?

19
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:15,325
I kinda… I don't really know a lot about you.

20
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:20,080
Because when you transferred to the school, we weren't really close.

21
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:22,624
-That's right. -We've gotten a little closer now, right?

22
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:25,710
-We became closer after cooking together. -Yeah.

23
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:28,129
I have a lot of fun when I'm with you

24
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:30,757
because, uh, the conversation really flows.

25
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,758
Mm.

26
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:33,301
It's fun to be with you.

27
00:01:33,384 --> 00:01:35,762
-And you're pretty, too. -What should we--

28
00:01:35,845 --> 00:01:38,473
Yeah, so… You are so pretty.

29
00:01:38,556 --> 00:01:40,308
-[exclaims] -[Ji-eun] What's this?

30
00:01:40,391 --> 00:01:42,560
-[Se-woon] That was sudden. -So straightforward.

31
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:45,146
-Ji-woo must be feeling conflicted. -He's going so fast.

32
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,482
When you arrived, I thought you were really pretty.

33
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:49,734
-What was my first impression? -You were so pretty…

34
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:51,778
-Really? -That was the first impression.

35
00:01:51,861 --> 00:01:54,614
So I kind of fell for you. Yeah, that's what happened.

36
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:57,617
-Yeah. -Oh, wow. Oh, my God.

37
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,202
[Ji-min] I kinda fell for you.

38
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:01,663
Ever since then, uh, I've had feelings for you.

39
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:05,583
So I wanted to get to know you better, but Jung-yun beat me to it.

40
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:07,085
-I've just been watching. -Really?

41
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:09,671
-Yeah. I'm fine with it. -I seriously had no idea.

42
00:02:09,754 --> 00:02:11,673
-I admire that. -You do?

43
00:02:11,756 --> 00:02:14,134
If you hadn't told me, I would've never known.

44
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:16,386
Honestly, I'm super shy.

45
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:18,847
This is my first time doing something like this.

46
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:21,224
-That's crazy. -Crazy, right?

47
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:24,185
I thought it would be best to make this clear to you

48
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:26,563
and I'd like to go on dates to get to know you better.

49
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:29,816
-Of course, I'd love that. -So now that you know how I feel,

50
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:32,235
-I wanna hang out more with you. -Yeah, sure.

51
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:34,195
I seriously had no idea.

52
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:37,365
Really? We've never had a serious conversation before.

53
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:39,742
-We didn't have time-- -That's why you had no idea.

54
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:42,245
I want to go on a dream date with you.

55
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:44,372
-Sure. -Would you say yes if I asked you out?

56
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:46,541
-Of course. -Then I'll just go.

So funny.

When you just move your legs, I'll just contract space.

61
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:57,343
-I'll write "Lee Ji-min" on there. -Okay.

62
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,512
-Let's go on a date. -Let's go.

63
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:01,514
Think of what you wanna do, what you wanna eat.

64
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:03,558
Okay. When should we go?

65
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:07,478
I'm going with Se-yeon tomorrow. Any time after that is fine.

66
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:09,397
I'm free starting from the day after.

67
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,692
-It's a shame you had a date tomorrow. -[Ji-woo laughs]

68
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:16,446
Also, from now on, I'm gonna try to get closer to you.

69
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:19,824
-So please make room for me, okay? -Sure.

70
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:23,661
Whoa, cool. I never imagined this would happen.

71
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:26,414
-This is interesting. -[Kyuhyun] Wow.

72
00:03:26,497 --> 00:03:28,708
Ji-min had those feelings ever since the school.

73
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:31,878
-Now, all of a sudden… -Seriously, I didn't see this coming.

74
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:34,088
I thought he'd do it while he's drunk.

75
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:36,591
So he confessed his feelings for Ji-woo.

76
00:03:36,674 --> 00:03:38,468
I wonder how Ji-woo's taking all of this.

77
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:41,763
-She's just surprised. -"I'm shocked. I didn't see this coming."

78
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:43,765
-"Thank you." -"Thanks." That was about it.

79
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:46,517
-She seemed more excited with Se-yeon. -Definitely.

80
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:47,685
-That's right. -Right?

81
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:50,230
She liked it and she was excited.

82
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:52,857
-Ah, even we felt that, too. -[Se-woon] Right.

83
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:54,275
But this time it wasn't really…

84
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:57,487
-Maybe it's because it's daytime. -That's what I kept thinking.

85
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,530
Is it because she hasn't been drinking?

86
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:04,577
[Se-yeon hesitates] I mean, ugh, I… It's a pretty long story.

87
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:09,457
For me, Ye-rin used to be the one that I liked the most.

88
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,251
But now that I'm staying here,

89
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,462
I keep seeing Ji-woo and Jung-yun together.

90
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:17,423
-It doesn't make me feel very good. -Ah…

91
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:19,676
[Se-yeon] I can't stop thinking about them.

92
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,177
I was like, "This won't work."

93
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:24,138
I really need to have an honest conversation about this.

94
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:27,433
Ye-rin told me not to worry, but, you know.

95
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:31,729
-Being honest can be better sometimes. -Yeah, I was being really honest.

96
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:34,983
Ji-woo and I had a long conversation, too.

97
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:39,362
We talked for a while and we told each other how we feel.

98
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:42,407
But then even after I shared my honest feelings,

99
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:44,909
I still can't organize my thoughts.

100
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:48,162
-I don't know how I really feel. -Right.

101
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:51,040
[Se-yeon] Things are so hard right now, it's so difficult.

102
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:53,126
[slurping]

103
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:02,593
-Didn't you guys eat ramen yesterday too? -[Pyeong-seok] Mm.

104
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:04,721
You guys ate the yukgaejang, didn't you?

105
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:09,517
-Those are the two guys that Ye-rin wants. -Oh, true.

106
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,602
-That's true. -Pyeong-seok and Se-yeon.

107
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:12,937
Want a bowl?

108
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:15,148
[Ye-rin] A bowl?

109
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:18,318
You'll let me have some?

110
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:21,738
Oh, you want some of mine? Oh, you… You can have it, then.

111
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:23,990
Thanks

112
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:28,911
[Se-yeon] Hey, I want to drink all of a sudden.

113
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:38,838
-Get up if you're done eating. -Hm?

114
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:42,425
-I thought you were getting up? -No, no. Do you want me to get up?

115
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:44,719
-Then I'm just gonna stay here. -Sure.

116
00:05:44,802 --> 00:05:46,345
-What? Should I leave? -No, no.

117
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,269
Do either of you guys want some?

118
00:05:53,352 --> 00:05:54,562
It's super good.

119
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:59,025
-Why is it so hot in here? -[Pyeong-seok] I'll step outside.

120
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:00,818
-It's so hot. -It's hot.

121
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:02,904
After Se-yeon and I talked,

122
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:06,240
we agreed not to let this situation make us uncomfortable.

123
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:09,619
But we started to feel uncomfortable around each other.

124
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:11,996
After that day,

125
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:18,836
I got the feeling that Se-yeon was trying to distance himself from me.

126
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:23,841
I felt kinda hurt, and I was like, "What should I do about this situation?"

127
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,389
Wanna go downstairs?

128
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:33,392
-Are the others in the basement? -Let's go to the basement.

129
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:36,395
-They're all gaming. -What game? Oh, let's play, too.

130
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,898
-We should go. -[Ji-min and Ji-woo] Aren't you coming?

131
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:40,691
Go ahead. I'll come after I eat this.

132
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:44,153
-[Ji-min] Okay. -[Ji-woo] Let me wash my hands.

133
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:48,366
Are we going to, uh, on a date tomorrow?

134
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:50,785
-[Se-yeon] Hm? -Are we going on a date?

135
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:52,829
Have you thought of place you wanna go to?

136
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:53,996
So soon?

137
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,499
-You told me to decide yesterday. -I know.

138
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:58,334
Or if not, you can think about it.

139
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:03,089
Are we going? Uh, or am I…

140
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:13,558
Uh, let's talk later. Later.

141
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:27,780
SE-YEON

142
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:31,742
I guess I should say that I was surprised and a little stumped.

143
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,328
If I'm being honest,

144
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:38,916
when Ye-rin, Ji-woo, and I are near one another,

145
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:41,627
I find myself feeling uncomfortable.

146
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:50,136
[Ji-woo] So make the candles…

147
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:52,597
What time did you wanna leave again?

148
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:54,265
Or we could…

149
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:05,485
Oh, Ji-woo. [sighs]

150
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:09,447
[chuckles]

151
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:10,990
What? What? What?

152
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:13,576
What I'm looking at right now.

153
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:19,290
-It's interesting. Very entertaining. -I'm curious about what you think of this.

154
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:21,083
Yesterday, I…

155
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:24,295
Yeah, I heard you talked with Ji-woo.

156
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:25,671
[chuckles]

157
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:29,383
Oh, I had to gather up a lot of courage yesterday.

158
00:08:30,134 --> 00:08:31,385
Mm.

159
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:34,722
[Hee-ji] This is so entertaining.

160
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:38,184
It kind of feels like I'm watching a TV show.

161
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:40,520
-What about you? What about you? -Hm?

162
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:42,813
-What about you? -What? What about me?

163
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:45,441
What about me?

164
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:48,778
You say that like you don't have anything going on.

165
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:50,571
What about me? What about me?

166
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:54,033
After I started living at the House,

167
00:08:54,116 --> 00:08:57,495
it became more and more fun to talk with Pyeong-seok.

168
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:02,750
That's how I became more certain about my feelings toward him.

169
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:05,461
It keeps getting more fun.

170
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:07,964
I wonder about Hee-Ji and Pyeong-seok.

171
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:10,466
I feel like something will happen with Pyeong-seok.

172
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,301
[Su-hyun] I feel the same way.

173
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:15,972
-[Sang-won] Bowling, oh. -[Pyeong-seok] Wow, bowling.

174
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:19,267
You want to go bowling?

175
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:23,062
-[Sang-won] How many points can you get? -[Pyeong-seok] I can get 200 points.

176
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:24,814
[Sang-won] Really? You're super good.

177
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:28,651
When I was really good, I could only get 150.

178
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:30,945
Look, I need to show Pyeong-seok something.

179
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:32,405
-[Sang-won] Okay. -Come here.

180
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:34,615
-Oh. -I have something to show you.

181
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:35,992
It got in my shoes.

182
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,711
[Ye-rin] Where should I do this?

183
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:48,713
[Pyeong-seok] What is it?

184
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:53,426
Follow me, I have something to show you.

185
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:54,802
Why is it so messy?

186
00:09:58,598 --> 00:09:59,557
[Pyeong-seok sighs]

187
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,683
[door closes]

188
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:02,893
[Ye-rin] Look at this.

189
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:04,061
What is it?

190
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:09,317
Did you really think I had something to show you? I don't.

191
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:14,655
Hey. Oh, I thought you were gonna leave.

192
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:16,616
What?

193
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,704
-What are you doing tomorrow? -Tomorrow?

194
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:23,080
I'm not doing anything.

195
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:25,958
Let's go.

196
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:29,295
-For dinner. -Should we? For dinner?

197
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:32,757
But today, uh…

198
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:38,054
They're announcing new dream dates today.

199
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:40,556
If the dream date is something that I want,

200
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,933
then I'm going to bring you.

201
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:47,229
-What do you think? -Okay.

202
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:51,067
Okay? Then I'm going to run up there when I see something that I want.

203
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,110
I'll take it I just got your consent.

204
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:55,154
-Okay. -Okay.

205
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:57,948
If the dream date isn't that nice,

206
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:01,410
then we'll just have dinner tomorrow.

207
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:04,288
But if the dream date is something that you want

208
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:06,707
and you want to go with somebody,

209
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:09,085
then just go, get her consent and just do it.

210
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:10,044
Okay.

211
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:13,172
Just go for it if the dream date is something that you want.

212
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:15,091
-Okay? -Mm.

213
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:18,344
-The end. -[in Korean] All right.

214
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:20,179
[in English] That was easy, right?

215
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:22,306
[Pyeong-seok] Noona, you're so cool.

216
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:26,560
-You too, Oppa. -[both laugh]

217
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:28,312
PYEONG-SEOK

218
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:29,980
I really didn't see it coming.

219
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:34,068
If it was just a casual date, it wouldn't have felt that serious.

220
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:38,072
She asked me out on the dream date, too, so I'm a bit…

221
00:11:39,573 --> 00:11:41,742
It gave me a lot to think about.

222
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:43,327
YE-RIN

223
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:46,122
If I use my dream date on Se-yeon,

224
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:48,749
he'll use his on some other girl.

225
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:52,253
I don't really want to watch that happen.

226
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:56,006
Besides, I also want to get to know Pyeong-seok better.

227
00:11:56,090 --> 00:12:00,469
So I asked Pyeong-seok on the dream date because I wanted to figure things out.

228
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:06,016
All right, so Ye-rin is going for Pyeong-seok instead of Se-yeon.

229
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,977
She didn't use up her own date.

230
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:11,313
She just said, "Choose between me and Ji-woo

231
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:13,941
and ask one of us out on a dream date."

232
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:18,070
Then she asked Pyeong-seok out. That's pretty smart.

233
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:20,739
There's no guarantee that Se-yeon will use his date on Ye-rin.

234
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:23,951
True, there's no guarantee. She may still think about it.

235
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:25,995
She kind of cornered herself.

236
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:28,831
She drove herself all the way to the Maginot Line.

237
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:31,208
And now she's at that line, putting up a fight.

238
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:33,294
What do you think Pyeong-seok will do?

239
00:12:33,377 --> 00:12:34,920
Will he be swayed or not?

240
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:36,464
I think he might change his mind.

241
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:38,883
This is the first time he's going through this.

242
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:42,178
Yeah. I guess it's like a third party intervening?

243
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:44,180
-How should I put this? -[Ji-eun] Yeah.

244
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:48,142
He's never had a third party intervene like this since the show started.

245
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:49,143
[Su-hyun] Right.

246
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:51,479
This may be his first time in his life.

247
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:54,023
Rather than changing his mind because of Ye-rin,

248
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:56,817
the situation itself might make him change his mind.

249
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:57,735
[Se-woon] Hm.

250
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:01,113
-[Ji-woo] Wanna try this? -[Seo-hyeon] Sure. Looks scary.

251
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:03,407
-Anyone have questions? -Quick, I'm scared.

252
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:05,284
Oh, I'm nervous. I'm scared.

253
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:09,079
Say, "I'm one of the top three prettiest girls here."

254
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:12,625
No, no. I'm really not.

255
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:14,668
It'd be hilarious if it said you're lying.

256
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:16,003
No! I'm scared.

257
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:17,087
I'm really not.

258
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:18,339
-[buzzes] -[screams]

259
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:19,465
LIE

260
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:22,176
-[screaming] -[all laughing]

261
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:24,220
[Sang-won] That was a good one, right?

262
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:26,055
-Come on. -That was a good question.

263
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:28,557
-Okay, all right. -[Jung-yun] What the heck?

264
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:31,727
-Wow! Wow, Ji-woo. -[Jung-yun] Okay, then.

265
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:34,939
It's because I did this in the middle.

266
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:36,065
Hee-ji.

267
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:39,944
I think I'd win an arm wrestling match against Pyeong-seok.

268
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:42,196
-[Sang-won] Win? -He's strong, you brat.

269
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:45,616
-I can't beat him. -[Sang-won] It'll say she's lying.

270
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:48,994
-[buzzes] -You liar.

271
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:49,912
LIE

272
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:50,996
[Sang-won] Pyeong-seok!

273
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:54,041
-[Seo-hyeon] I want them to try it. -[Sang-won] Pyeong-seok!

274
00:13:58,295 --> 00:14:00,965
-[Seo-hyeon] You liars. -[Sang-won] I have a question.

275
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:03,968
"Yesterday's date wasn't any fun."

276
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:07,972
It was fun! It was fun!

277
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:12,601
It was fun! It was fun! It was fun!

278
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:13,978
It was fun! It was fun!

279
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:15,771
-I had so much fun. -[chimes]

280
00:14:15,854 --> 00:14:17,314
TRUTH

281
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:18,566
It was fun.

282
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:20,901
[laughing]

283
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:23,487
[Seo-hyeon] Oh!

284
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:26,198
[Sang-won] Oh, it makes sense. You were nervous.

285
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:28,868
Oh, that was hard, seriously.

286
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:30,953
-This is the last one. -I'll ask something.

287
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:33,914
"I wanna go on my next date with someone other than Sang-won."

288
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:36,834
-Hey, it's not like that. -[Sang-won] Okay, sure.

289
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:38,085
I don't… I don't, uh…

290
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:40,170
I don't… I don't… I don't…

291
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:41,922
That stings. Oh, I don't.

292
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:43,465
-[buzzes] -[all laughing]

293
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:44,550
LIE

294
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:46,552
[all laughing]

295
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:48,304
Why are you freaking out too?

296
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:50,639
[Jung-yun] I thought I was looking at a ghost.

297
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:53,017
Oh, wait. Hey, wait. That's not true.

298
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,561
-[Jung-yun] We'll let you two talk. -That's not true!

299
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:57,897
Let go. It's all good, let go of me.

300
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,274
Seo-hyeon probably doesn't wanna be stuck with me.

301
00:15:00,357 --> 00:15:03,694
Hey, Seo-hyeon. If you're staying here, you can check on the order.

302
00:15:03,777 --> 00:15:07,364
-Come get us when it's here. -This keeps saying everything's a lie.

303
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:09,366
So you know who you want for your next date.

304
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:10,951
-Hold on. -I don't know.

305
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:12,995
[Ji-woo] Sang-won, you need to stay in there.

306
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:14,872
[all laughing]

307
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:15,915
I'm a woman.

308
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:18,042
I'm a woman!

309
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:19,376
I'm a woman.

310
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,294
TRUTH

311
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:21,962
Let's throw this thing out.

312
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:24,798
-[all laughing] -"Let's throw this thing out."

313
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:28,469
-That machine is super accurate. -That machine is super credible.

314
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:41,857
-Can you exit through it? -You can go out there.

315
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:45,194
You've gone out there before. You don't remember?

316
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:47,988
-Don't you remember yesterday? -I remember everything.

317
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:50,240
-Don't you remember? -I remember everything.

318
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:53,369
-I got annoyed because you didn't answer. -So you remember.

319
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:56,080
Is there someone else you'd like to go on date with?

320
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:58,832
-No. -Would you still go out with me?

321
00:15:58,916 --> 00:15:59,917
Would I?

322
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:02,836
[both chuckle]

323
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:08,884
-We should talk about yesterday. -Yesterday?

324
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,719
Se-yeon's feelings?

325
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:13,639
-I heard it, too. -You heard it?

326
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:15,474
I went outside to have a beer.

327
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:17,601
Oh, you must not have noticed.

328
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:19,061
[chuckles]

329
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:21,230
[Ji-woo] I was a bit surprised.

330
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:27,111
-Why? How did you feel when you heard it? -Me?

331
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:28,946
Oh, that can happen.

332
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:32,032
"Oh, that can happen"? That's it?

333
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:36,453
Is that all you talked about?

334
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:40,708
I just kept listening and being surprised. I really had no idea.

335
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,212
Who are you going on your dream date with?

336
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:49,049
-Made plans with someone? -My dream date?

337
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:52,136
Ji-min asked me to go. He did ask me.

338
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:54,096
Ji-min?

339
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:58,434
-What? Ji-min? -[Kyuhyun] What?

340
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:01,395
-[all laughing] -Look, he's surprised.

341
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:03,397
Ji-min?

342
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:06,567
[Ji-woo] I had no idea Ji-min would do that.

343
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:10,195
I was surprised. I really had no idea.

344
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:12,865
So you're busy.

345
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:16,118
So what if I'm busy?

346
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:18,537
If you're busy…

347
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:23,167
I don't know.

348
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:27,588
-[Jung-yun exhales] -[Ji-woo sighs]

349
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:31,717
[inhales] Okay. Have fun on your date.

350
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:34,219
[sighing] Oh, seriously.

351
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:37,014
[Jung-yun sighs]

352
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:44,396
You always… You're such an idiot.

353
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,106
-Me? -Yeah.

354
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:51,570
[sighs]

355
00:17:57,659 --> 00:18:00,704
Jung-yun should have asked her to not go.

356
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:03,248
I think she wanted something like, "I'm jealous."

357
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:04,833
"Don't go. Let's go together."

358
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,293
When Jung-yun said that, though,

359
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:08,087
he wasn't actually telling her to have fun.

360
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:09,880
-True. -She probably didn't know.

361
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:11,465
His heart is breaking.

362
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:13,258
Ji-woo definitely likes Jung-yun the most.

363
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:14,676
[Su-hyun] Seems like it.

364
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,638
That's why I love it so much. "You're such an idiot."

365
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:19,681
That's such a nice expression.

366
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,433
"You're such an idiot."

367
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:25,270
[Se-woon] "You're an idiot." You need to turn your head as you say it.

368
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:27,981
"You idiot. You have no idea how I feel."

369
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:29,149
[Ye-rin] Let's go.

370
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:35,906
YE-RIN &amp; JI-MIN'S DATE

371
00:18:35,989 --> 00:18:37,574
-Huh? -[Su-hyun] Huh?

372
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:39,451
The date. They're going out for a meal.

373
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:40,786
Oh, right, right, right.

374
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,913
[Ye-rin] Seatbelt.

375
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:49,336
Bowling, bowling. Bowling is so hard.

376
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:52,005
Let's make it look awesome.

377
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:53,549
-Look awesome? -Yeah, awesome.

378
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,801
[mimics whooshing, chuckles]

379
00:18:57,052 --> 00:18:59,221
Make people say, "Wow, Ye-rin is so cool."

380
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:00,556
Did you just fall for me?

381
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:03,517
-[both chuckle] -"Ye-rin, I just fell for you!"

382
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:07,437
You'll fall for my bowling.

383
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:11,316
-[Ye-rin] Bowling, bowling. -[Ji-min] I'm so excited to go bowling.

384
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,488
What do you like about Ji-woo? I don't really know about girls,

385
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:18,490
-because I'm also a girl. -First of all,

386
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:20,909
Ji-woo has a really innocent look.

387
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:23,078
-Yeah. -She kinda looks like a cat, too.

388
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:26,790
But we talk back and forth like Tiki-Taka soccer.

389
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:28,834
So it's fun to talk with her.

390
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:32,421
Yeah. She's charming.

391
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:34,047
Oh…

392
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:38,802
I think it's really important to know why you like somebody.

393
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,639
-Why do you like him? -I don't know.

394
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:44,933
Because he's hot? [chuckles]

395
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:48,979
Hey, do you think I'd fall for someone because they're hot?

396
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:51,732
-No. It's not about looks for me. -No, he is handsome.

397
00:19:51,815 --> 00:19:54,401
-Se-yeon? -Yeah. It's normal to fall for people

398
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:55,903
who are handsome and pretty.

399
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:57,404
You can't really help it.

400
00:19:57,487 --> 00:20:00,824
You can't expect people to just look at what's on the inside.

401
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:04,494
Yeah, so you don't need to be like that. Just be honest.

402
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:09,333
[Ye-rin] It's kind of like…

403
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:13,378
I don't need to feel this way. There's no need for me to feel bad.

404
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:17,132
But I feel bad because the person who was my number one is second now.

405
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:20,886
But I don't think that I should be feeling that kind of emotion here.

406
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:22,763
That's true. After all, this place…

407
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:24,598
-Is a battlefield. -…a battle.

408
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:27,142
-Well, you never know. -Choi.

409
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,519
-Lee. -Lee.

410
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:31,939
-Choi… Cross. [laughs] -Cross.

411
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:35,442
One more time, but better? You do it.

412
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:36,652
-Lee. -Choi.

413
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,487
-Cross. -Cross.

414
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:44,701
-Hey, I want to eat. -[laughs] Hey, go and get some alcohol.

415
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:48,121
BOWLING ALLEY

416
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:50,040
[people applauding]

417
00:20:50,123 --> 00:20:53,085
[Ji-min] Wow, I haven't been to a bowling alley in forever.

418
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:55,295
-All right, you can go first. -Okay.

419
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:57,005
Show me what you got.

420
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:58,215
Should I do it?

421
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:04,263
You got this. Strike, strike!

422
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:10,102
[in Korean] Come on.

423
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:13,021
-[in English] I'm really bad at bowling! -Wow, you're so good.

424
00:21:13,897 --> 00:21:15,774
Ugh, one second, let me just…

425
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:23,949
One, hey. [laughs]

426
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:26,952
[Ye-rin] Show me how it's done.

427
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:30,539
[Ji-min] Oh! Hey, that was too…

428
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:33,625
-[laughs] -I haven't done this in so long.

429
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:34,584
It's okay.

430
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:36,795
-I'm shocked at how bad I am. -I might beat you.

431
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:38,380
-[both laugh] -I'm actually so bad.

432
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:39,464
No way.

433
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:42,342
-I might beat you. -Okay, I guess you can.

434
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:44,052
-Watch closely. -You got this.

435
00:21:45,178 --> 00:21:46,263
But why…

436
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:48,307
Oh!

437
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:50,892
Hey!

438
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:54,354
This is what you call talent.

439
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:56,732
Why are you so good? You're good.

440
00:21:58,900 --> 00:21:59,985
Show me.

441
00:22:03,196 --> 00:22:04,239
Wow!

442
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:05,574
-You really showed me. -Nice!

443
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:07,284
-Oh, my God. -I showed them.

444
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:11,913
-Wow! You're so cool, Oppa. -Strike, strike.

445
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:18,086
Oh! Huh? Really?

446
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:20,172
Ye-rin? Seriously?

447
00:22:21,214 --> 00:22:22,924
-Damn! -I knew it.

448
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:25,260
-[both laugh] -That went wrong.

449
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:27,512
Oh, nice!

450
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:31,683
-Wow! Wow! -That was good.

451
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:33,894
They've been getting along so far, right?

452
00:22:33,977 --> 00:22:36,188
-Good friends vibe so far. -A friend vibe.

453
00:22:36,271 --> 00:22:38,065
Se-woon, you don't look like you agree.

454
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:40,150
-[all laugh] -He has his arms crossed.

455
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:42,736
-That means… -I don't think it meant anything really.

456
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:44,654
-[all laugh] -[Ji-eun] Right?

457
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:48,116
If I'm being honest, they just went bowling for the first time.

458
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,327
I mean, they're playing a sport right now.

459
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:52,829
So I think it'll be hard to know what they're feeling.

460
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:55,040
-They need to talk. -I'm excited to see them eat.

461
00:22:55,123 --> 00:22:56,374
There might be something--

462
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:59,669
You can never be sure about anything. This show is scary.

463
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:03,757
Something unexpected might happen after leaving them alone for one minute.

464
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:04,841
[laughs]

465
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:07,052
It's important to spend time together.

466
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:11,389
JUNG-YUN &amp; JI-WOO'S DATE

467
00:23:14,392 --> 00:23:16,561
-What's with that face? -Huh?

468
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:17,938
What's with the face?

469
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,565
-I'm thinking. -About what?

470
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,027
-Nothing. -Oh.

471
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:25,987
What are you thinking about?

472
00:23:26,988 --> 00:23:28,490
-I'll tell you later. -Oh…

473
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:34,121
I want to know.

474
00:23:35,997 --> 00:23:37,916
I have another question.

475
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:40,585
-What? -Who did you like the most

476
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:43,588
before I arrived?

477
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:45,507
I didn't have anybody at that point.

478
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:48,218
I mean, it's not that I didn't have anybody,

479
00:23:48,301 --> 00:23:50,762
but they were all just, you know…

480
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:52,222
They were all just friends?

481
00:23:52,889 --> 00:23:53,807
Hm.

482
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:57,602
-So I'm the first one that you liked? -What do you mean? Hm.

483
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:03,108
[softly] That's crazy.

484
00:24:03,191 --> 00:24:05,777
[in normal voice] I thought you had zero interest in me.

485
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:07,988
-Really? -You never even looked at me once.

486
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:09,573
I couldn't look at you.

487
00:24:09,656 --> 00:24:12,409
-Why? Why? -What? I couldn't just stare at you.

488
00:24:12,492 --> 00:24:15,078
Mm. [chuckles softly]

489
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:18,331
Back then I didn't think that anybody was interested in me.

490
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:19,541
But now…

491
00:24:21,918 --> 00:24:23,837
I had no idea.

492
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:25,797
[inhales sharply]

493
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:31,344
-[Ji-woo] Did you know? -Know what?

494
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:33,889
-That they liked me. -No, I didn't know.

495
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:36,224
Yeah, me neither. I seriously didn't know.

496
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:39,394
So you heard it for the first time yesterday?

497
00:24:40,228 --> 00:24:43,023
And your answer was, "That can happen"?

498
00:24:43,106 --> 00:24:44,274
That can happen.

499
00:24:44,357 --> 00:24:46,109
I mean, that can happen.

500
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:47,736
[Ji-woo] That can happen.

501
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:50,280
It is…

502
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:54,284
[clicks tongue]

503
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:57,621
[Jung-yun tapping car door]

504
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,498
[sighs]

505
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,466
So how did you feel when the others talked to you?

506
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:14,137
Well, I was super surprised.

507
00:25:15,138 --> 00:25:18,141
And I thought it was kind of cool.

508
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:24,272
Everybody was kind of saying that you and I are meant to be.

509
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:25,315
They all said that.

510
00:25:26,566 --> 00:25:28,735
Se-yeon and Ji-min felt that way too.

511
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:31,446
If I were them,

512
00:25:31,529 --> 00:25:34,199
I would have quietly given up.

513
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:40,247
So I was kind of impressed that they took the courage to say that.

514
00:25:52,425 --> 00:25:55,512
-[Ji-eun] Show some courage, Jung-yun. -This is gonna drive him crazy.

515
00:25:55,595 --> 00:25:57,889
[Ji-eun] You need to show some courage.

516
00:25:57,973 --> 00:25:59,266
Hold her hand!

517
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:00,642
Oh, oh! That scared me.

518
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:03,812
-Sorry, I got excited. -I thought you said "fold" her hands.

519
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:07,315
CANDLE STUDIO

520
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:09,150
-[woman] Hello. -[Ji-woo] Hello.

521
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:10,694
[woman] Welcome.

522
00:26:10,777 --> 00:26:12,821
-Would you like an apron? -[Ji-woo] Yeah.

523
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:22,205
-Can you tie? -I'll do it for you.

524
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:27,836
-All done. Okay. -[Jung-yun] All done? I'll do yours.

525
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:30,839
[Ji-woo] Mm.

526
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:37,470
Got it, got it, got it.

527
00:26:37,554 --> 00:26:40,348
So have you ever made a candle before?

528
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:41,808
-This is my first time. -No.

529
00:26:41,891 --> 00:26:43,476
[woman] It's your first time?

530
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,729
Here are some fragrances.

531
00:26:45,812 --> 00:26:48,148
You can open them like this and smell them.

532
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:50,608
Open it up like this.

533
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:53,987
You can each pick out a fragrance.

534
00:26:54,904 --> 00:26:56,865
Oh, I like fragrances.

535
00:26:59,534 --> 00:27:03,455
-[woman] Remove the cap. -Oh, thanks. I couldn't smell anything.

536
00:27:03,538 --> 00:27:04,497
Oh!

537
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:08,168
Oh, if it's too strong, just remove the small cap on the top.

538
00:27:08,251 --> 00:27:09,627
Why did you do it like…

539
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:12,005
Hey, I didn't know. [chuckles]

540
00:27:12,088 --> 00:27:14,549
-Mm. I like this one. -[woman] That's it.

541
00:27:14,632 --> 00:27:16,009
Here. Smell this.

542
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:21,181
-What do you think? -Oh.

543
00:27:21,264 --> 00:27:23,058
-Should I set it aside? -I like it.

544
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:24,517
-Like it? -Vanilla.

545
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:29,105
I like this one.

546
00:27:31,691 --> 00:27:32,942
-Do this one. -This one?

547
00:27:33,026 --> 00:27:34,569
All right.

548
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:37,113
Put it in.

549
00:27:37,864 --> 00:27:39,157
Eleven-- Whoa!

550
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:42,118
I got it just right. [chuckles nervously]

551
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:48,792
-But this one looks kind of special. -I'll use one of those.

552
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:51,669
-[chuckles] You immediately-- -I need to cut it, right?

553
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:53,505
Oh, this one's cute.

554
00:27:53,588 --> 00:27:54,714
It's cute.

555
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:58,051
You should make yours look like mine.

556
00:27:58,134 --> 00:27:59,803
Here, use the blue one.

557
00:27:59,886 --> 00:28:02,097
Whoa, it's cute. [gasps]

558
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:05,642
-[Jung-yun] It's crazy. It's amazing. -[Ji-woo] Amazing. Amazing.

559
00:28:05,725 --> 00:28:09,354
-I'll add some of this. -[in Korean] Okay. Oh.

560
00:28:17,737 --> 00:28:18,738
[chuckles]

561
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:25,328
-[Jung-yun, in English] This is it. -This is it.

562
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:26,287
[Jung-yun] Wow.

563
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:28,081
-Smells great. -[chuckles softly]

564
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:30,959
Wow! This looks so cute.

565
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:34,170
-[Jung-yun chuckles] -[Ji-woo] Cheers! You did a great job!

566
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:41,761
[Se-yeon] In the afternoon,

567
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:44,556
I went to the table tennis club and practiced on my own.

568
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:48,184
I was feeling very conflicted.

569
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:52,147
I was having a lot of mixed emotions.

570
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:56,651
[grunting]

571
00:28:58,361 --> 00:29:00,530
I really wanted to play table tennis

572
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:04,909
because I don't get any stray thoughts when I'm playing.

573
00:29:08,204 --> 00:29:11,082
-[Jung-yun] What should we order? Sushi? -[Ji-woo] Sushi.

574
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:12,417
Can you tell me?

575
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,502
-Can you tell me? -Tell you what?

576
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:16,045
What you said you'd tell me earlier.

577
00:29:16,129 --> 00:29:18,173
-What's with that face? -Huh?

578
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:20,008
What's with the face?

579
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:21,968
-I'm thinking. -About what?

580
00:29:24,053 --> 00:29:25,180
Nothing.

581
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,977
Right, uh, but, maybe later.

582
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:38,777
-[waiter] Here's your beer. -[Jung-yun] Thank you.

583
00:29:42,572 --> 00:29:44,157
[Ji-woo] Thank you.

584
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,241
[waiter] Enjoy.

585
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:49,287
[Jung-yun] Thank you.

586
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:51,790
-This looks so good. -Soy sauce.

587
00:29:53,082 --> 00:29:54,709
I've never tried this before.

588
00:30:03,718 --> 00:30:04,552
[chuckles]

589
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:07,806
-It's good. -It's good.

590
00:30:08,556 --> 00:30:10,225
I'm so hungry. Let's eat.

591
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,520
I'm gonna eat some sushi.

592
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:16,231
[Jung-yun] Bon appétit.

593
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:17,482
[Ji-woo] Bon appétit.

594
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:20,693
[gasps]

595
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:29,536
-Is it good? It's good. -It's good.

596
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:36,668
-I'm curious. -About what?

597
00:30:36,751 --> 00:30:38,962
The thing that you said you'd tell me.

598
00:30:40,421 --> 00:30:41,381
[clears throat]

599
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:49,973
-[clicks tongue] -[sighs]

600
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:52,183
[sighs]

601
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:56,521
Are we talking through our breathing right now?

602
00:30:56,604 --> 00:30:58,940
[breathing heavily]

603
00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:08,116
I just have a lot on my mind, that's all.

604
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:09,701
I swear.

605
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:14,330
Q. WHAT WERE YOU GOING TO SAY?

606
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:16,833
I wasn't really planning on telling her anything.

607
00:31:17,792 --> 00:31:21,296
I was gonna say something like, "Let's go on another date some time."

608
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,591
But it was kind of hard to say that right to her face.

609
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:27,135
JI-WOO

610
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:29,637
Jung-yun doesn't usually say what he feels.

611
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:32,181
So it was frustrating.

612
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:33,683
It's frustrating.

613
00:31:33,766 --> 00:31:36,269
Yeah, the other guys are being so straightforward.

614
00:31:36,352 --> 00:31:38,605
He must have a lot to think about, though.

615
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:43,234
Do you know where you're going tomorrow?

616
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:45,153
We're gonna talk about it later.

617
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:47,155
You must be busy.

618
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:49,282
You keep saying I'm busy.

619
00:31:51,951 --> 00:31:53,119
Do you like being busy?

620
00:31:53,202 --> 00:31:54,329
Mm-mmm.

621
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:55,455
You don't like it?

622
00:31:56,706 --> 00:31:58,625
No, it's because…

623
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:01,294
I was so surprised.

624
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:04,422
And you feel conflicted when you're surprised.

625
00:32:04,505 --> 00:32:05,340
Conflicted?

626
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:07,759
-I don't like being conflicted. -You feel conflicted?

627
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:09,802
That could happen.

628
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:14,891
You really don't say much.

629
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:17,268
I can't figure you out.

630
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:20,229
It's hard to find somebody like me,

631
00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:23,191
somebody who you can read, even though I don't talk a lot.

632
00:32:23,816 --> 00:32:25,526
I can't read you unless you say something.

633
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:28,363
Don't you feel you know what I mean even if I don't tell you?

634
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:30,198
I can only know if you explain it to me.

635
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:32,951
-People should follow their hearts. -You think so?

636
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:35,161
Just look at Se-yeon and Ji-min.

637
00:32:35,244 --> 00:32:36,829
They're following their hearts.

638
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:42,085
I… I think I could learn from them.

639
00:32:46,255 --> 00:32:47,715
Follow my heart.

640
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:55,348
-This is good. -So when you heard that stuff,

641
00:32:55,431 --> 00:32:57,308
did you have a change of heart?

642
00:32:58,768 --> 00:33:00,186
Nothing changed.

643
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:02,188
I talked to Ji-min about this too.

644
00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:06,317
You're my… number one.

645
00:33:07,443 --> 00:33:09,112
Nothing's changed.

646
00:33:09,195 --> 00:33:11,155
But I have a wider point of view now.

647
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:13,366
Before Se-yeon and Ji-min talked to me,

648
00:33:13,449 --> 00:33:15,493
you were the only one that I was thinking about.

649
00:33:15,576 --> 00:33:19,122
But after Se-yeon talked to me, I thought about Se-yeon, too.

650
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:22,250
And after Ji-min talked to me, I thought about Ji-min too.

651
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:23,710
That's it for now.

652
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:29,674
Let's order one more.

653
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:31,509
-You want one more? -Are you okay?

654
00:33:31,592 --> 00:33:33,928
-You think you can drink one more? -Hm.

655
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:36,889
[sighs] Uh, do they have a stronger one?

656
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:37,932
[laughs]

657
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:41,644
You said you want to try a highball, right?

658
00:33:41,728 --> 00:33:43,062
Hee-ji said it's good.

659
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:45,440
-Okay. -I trust Hee-ji's taste buds.

660
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:47,859
[Jung-yun] Could we have two Suntory highballs?

661
00:33:47,942 --> 00:33:49,610
[waiter] Two Suntory highballs.

662
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:51,112
I'll get that right away.

663
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:54,407
Excuse me. I have two Suntory highballs for you guys.

664
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:57,326
-[Jung-yun] Thank you. -[Ji-woo] Thank you.

665
00:33:57,952 --> 00:33:58,953
[waiter] Enjoy.

666
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:03,124
Here. Cheers. Cheers.

667
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:05,418
-Cheers. -Cheers.

668
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:13,634
What do you think you'll do on your date tomorrow?

669
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:15,720
-Tomorrow? -What do you think it'll be like?

670
00:34:15,803 --> 00:34:16,721
[Ji-woo exhales]

671
00:34:16,804 --> 00:34:19,182
Well, I never really talked to Se-yeon.

672
00:34:19,265 --> 00:34:20,600
Yesterday…

673
00:34:20,683 --> 00:34:23,144
-Yesterday was the only time we talked. -Mm.

674
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:25,146
So I guess we'll talk.

675
00:34:25,688 --> 00:34:26,939
We'll eat, too.

676
00:34:28,524 --> 00:34:30,526
Don't have too much fun, okay?

677
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,030
How much fun should I have then?

678
00:34:34,113 --> 00:34:35,823
-Just a bit. -Just a bit?

679
00:34:38,951 --> 00:34:40,369
-Still, he finally said it. -Wow.

680
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:41,913
He told her about how he feels.

681
00:34:41,996 --> 00:34:42,872
He kinda said it.

682
00:34:42,955 --> 00:34:44,749
Ugh, I'm not too satisfied with it.

683
00:34:44,832 --> 00:34:46,334
Aw, Ji-woo smiled, though.

684
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:48,169
He still expressed himself.

685
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:49,295
That's good enough.

686
00:34:49,378 --> 00:34:52,507
You won't be drunk when you come back tomorrow, right?

687
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:55,134
What are you going to do if that happens?

688
00:34:55,218 --> 00:34:57,428
You're not coming back at 11:00 or anything, right?

689
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:58,721
[chuckles softly]

690
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:02,934
Hey, are you jealous?

691
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:05,770
[chuckles softly]

692
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:10,775
You're thinking so much because you're jealous, right?

693
00:35:10,858 --> 00:35:11,734
[gasps]

694
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:13,945
-Let's go. -She finally asked him directly.

695
00:35:14,028 --> 00:35:16,072
-Don't you dare say no. -[Su-hyun] Answer.

696
00:35:16,155 --> 00:35:18,616
-Say you're jealous. -[Su-hyun] Just say something.

697
00:35:18,699 --> 00:35:21,494
You're thinking so much because you're jealous, right?

698
00:35:21,577 --> 00:35:23,204
Is this making you anxious?

699
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,666
Maybe you're not-- You're just not quite there yet.

700
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:30,002
[slurping]

701
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:32,130
[sighs] I'm full now.

702
00:35:33,047 --> 00:35:34,173
-Oh. -Ah.

703
00:35:36,342 --> 00:35:38,010
[groans in frustration]

704
00:35:38,094 --> 00:35:40,638
-He has to tell her. -[Ji-eun] He needs to say it.

705
00:35:40,721 --> 00:35:43,516
You need to say something, no matter if you're friends or lovers.

706
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:51,524
You're thinking again.

707
00:35:52,108 --> 00:35:54,902
What if I go out on a day you're staying home, though?

708
00:35:56,195 --> 00:35:57,321
I think that's okay.

709
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:01,450
I mean, I'm going on dates with others too.

710
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:04,328
Besides, any one of us can go on a date if we want to.

711
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:07,415
So if you want to go on a date,

712
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:09,750
or if you're curious about somebody else,

713
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:11,085
you can go.

714
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:14,297
I mean, it's kind of funny that I'm giving you permission,

715
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:15,506
but I'm fine with it.

716
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:17,550
But you need to talk to me about it.

717
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:20,136
Either before or after you go.

718
00:36:20,219 --> 00:36:21,888
If you don't do that,

719
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:24,724
-I'll be mad. -[both giggling]

720
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:31,939
I was very straightforward just now, right?

721
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:33,357
-Yeah. -Yeah?

722
00:36:36,986 --> 00:36:39,322
[sighs] You're so frustrating.

723
00:36:39,405 --> 00:36:43,075
No, you're not frustrating at all. That's the way you work.

724
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:44,493
I respect that.

725
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:48,247
But you need to take responsibility for being so frustrating.

726
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:49,165
All right?

727
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:52,001
I'm saying stop doing it.

728
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:55,963
[Ji-woo chuckles]

729
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:02,929
Yeah, she's trying to scare him. She told him to take responsibility.

730
00:37:03,012 --> 00:37:05,806
"If you keep being so frustrating, I might go for somebody else."

731
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:07,225
"Take responsibility."

732
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:09,060
-But Ji-woo-- -Oh, I'm crying.

733
00:37:09,143 --> 00:37:11,437
Ji-woo is such a patient person.

734
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,689
Wow, Ji-woo is so charming and confident.

735
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:15,942
I guess that's what makes her so attractive.

736
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:18,152
Jung-yun is like, "I don't want you to go out

737
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:19,862
and I'll feel jealous if you do."

738
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:22,031
"I don't want you to go."

739
00:37:22,114 --> 00:37:23,991
That's what he wants to say.

740
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:26,160
He doesn't know what will happen if he says that.

741
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:28,120
He doesn't know how she'll take it.

742
00:37:28,204 --> 00:37:30,831
He's not confident enough, so keeps beating around the bush.

743
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:31,999
He's just young.

744
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:35,044
-Because he's inexperienced. -[Ji-eun] He doesn't wanna intervene.

745
00:37:35,127 --> 00:37:36,128
-Right. -[Su-hyun] Right.

746
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:38,214
He doesn't have a lot of experience,

747
00:37:38,297 --> 00:37:40,383
-so I think he's scared. -[groans] This is bad.

748
00:37:40,466 --> 00:37:43,052
It feels like Ji-woo is raising Jung-yun like a kid.

749
00:37:43,135 --> 00:37:43,970
[Ji-eun] Right.

750
00:37:44,053 --> 00:37:47,682
I might be getting ahead of myself, but if things don't work out between them,

751
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:51,269
I think these behaviors will pile up and lead to some kind of change.

752
00:37:52,728 --> 00:37:54,522
[Hee-ji] When is Se-yeon coming back?

753
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:56,607
[Pyeong-seok] Probably around 7:00 or 8:00.

754
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:58,150
What should we eat?

755
00:37:58,234 --> 00:38:00,319
Are we ordering something or making something?

756
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:02,947
[Pyeong-seok] Okay. I'm your chef for today.

757
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:04,407
[laughs]

758
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:05,658
Rest. Rest.

759
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:08,619
Oh, sit, sit. Come on, sit.

760
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:10,496
I'm the chef for today.

761
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:13,582
What's on the menu today, chef?

762
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:16,210
Uh, I'm having trouble tying my apron.

763
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:17,628
Oh, I'll tie it for you.

764
00:38:19,422 --> 00:38:20,715
[all] Whoa! Wow!

765
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:22,633
She was so far away from him.

766
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:25,511
-She ran over to him. -She ran to him right away.

767
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:30,141
-[Hee-ji] Yes, yes. -[Pyeong-seok] Okay.

768
00:38:31,517 --> 00:38:33,185
Here. Perfect. Okay.

769
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:34,770
Mm-hmm.

770
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,076
Hm.

771
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:54,206
[Seo-yeong] He's going to make something.

772
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:56,208
Making ramen counts as cooking, okay?

773
00:38:56,292 --> 00:38:58,127
I don't think ramen's a proper dish.

774
00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:00,087
Bibimmyeon. It's a real dish.

775
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:01,797
-Yeah. -Bibimmyeon is a real dish.

776
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:04,467
-It's an art form. You feel me? -[Pyeong-seok] Hm.

777
00:39:06,927 --> 00:39:08,721
[Hee-ji] Ooh.

778
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:11,515
[chokes]

779
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:13,267
Mm… [chuckles]

780
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:16,145
[Sang-won] Is Pyeong-seok pulling out his flat pork belly?

781
00:39:16,228 --> 00:39:19,148
-[Pyeong-seok] Don't be too surprised. -[Hee-ji] Chef Kim.

782
00:39:19,231 --> 00:39:21,108
[indistinct conversation]

783
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:31,160
[all gasping, exclaiming]

784
00:39:31,243 --> 00:39:32,620
This is great!

785
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:35,956
-Things are so peaceful over here. -Don't let anything else happen.

786
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,333
[Ji-eun] This is so relaxing.

787
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:39,335
[Ye-rin] Hey… Do you want some wine?

788
00:39:39,418 --> 00:39:41,629
-[Ji-min] Huh? Sure. Sure. -[Ye-rin] Fruity?

789
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:43,381
[Ji-min] We're ready to order.

790
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:45,216
[waiter] I'll be your waiter today.

791
00:39:47,343 --> 00:39:48,803
[chuckles]

792
00:39:52,139 --> 00:39:53,849
Do you have any questions for me?

793
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:57,186
-You and Ji-woo. -Ji-woo?

794
00:39:57,269 --> 00:40:00,940
I can kind of tell that you're interested in her.

795
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:03,651
I can see that.

796
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,362
It doesn't matter anymore.

797
00:40:06,445 --> 00:40:08,489
So you don't care if everybody knows?

798
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:12,910
Oh, but I mean… it's not…

799
00:40:12,993 --> 00:40:14,370
It's not set in stone.

800
00:40:14,453 --> 00:40:15,704
-I don't know yet. -Yeah.

801
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:17,706
-People can always change. -It's true.

802
00:40:18,332 --> 00:40:20,126
I might start liking you more.

803
00:40:20,209 --> 00:40:21,836
Liking me more?

804
00:40:22,461 --> 00:40:25,047
-You want to try it? -It's definitely a possibility.

805
00:40:25,131 --> 00:40:28,509
-Oh, what the-- That is so sudden! -What?

806
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:30,386
-Yeah, go ahead and try it. -Oh, Ji-min.

807
00:40:30,469 --> 00:40:31,762
Su-hyun was right.

808
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:33,931
Things can totally change in just one minute.

809
00:40:35,474 --> 00:40:36,434
[Ye-rin] Hold on.

810
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:39,687
This is so refreshing.

811
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:42,690
This is so refreshing hearing you say something like that.

812
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:49,655
Uh, you talked to Pyeong-seok a while ago.

813
00:40:49,738 --> 00:40:52,074
-I was wondering what you talked about. -Right.

814
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:54,076
-With Pyeong-seok? -Yeah, tell me.

815
00:40:55,953 --> 00:40:58,038
Pyeong-seok's a transfer student, too.

816
00:40:58,164 --> 00:41:02,001
If I'm being honest, I didn't feel anything for Pyeong-seok at first.

817
00:41:02,084 --> 00:41:04,920
It was just like, "Oh, it's the transfer student."

818
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:06,755
But after we moved to the house,

819
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:11,802
when I started thinking, "I wanna get to know Pyeong-seok better."

820
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:15,514
So I approached him first and said, "What are you doing tomorrow?"

821
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:17,725
"Let's grab dinner together," and things worked out.

822
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:19,643
So you're going on a date tomorrow?

823
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:22,521
-[Ye-rin] It's just a casual date. -Crap.

824
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:24,064
Bam.

825
00:41:25,024 --> 00:41:26,650
When I first met you, I thought,

826
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:30,279
"Oh, she's probably the last person that I'll become friends with."

827
00:41:30,863 --> 00:41:34,366
"And I might not become friends with her

828
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:36,785
even after I graduate from school."

829
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:38,037
Why?

830
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,455
You seemed cold.

831
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:42,041
Yeah, you seemed so cold.

832
00:41:42,124 --> 00:41:44,585
And that's what I thought, but now, of course,

833
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:46,545
of course I think you're pretty.

834
00:41:46,629 --> 00:41:49,048
-And you're a bit cold. -Oh, Ji-min, it's too late.

835
00:41:49,131 --> 00:41:50,466
No, it's not too late.

836
00:41:50,549 --> 00:41:52,885
I thought you were pretty, but with a cold vibe.

837
00:41:52,968 --> 00:41:53,928
That's what I thought.

838
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:56,222
And now that I've gotten closer with you…

839
00:41:57,556 --> 00:41:59,433
If I'm being honest, I, uh…

840
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:01,894
If I'm being honest, out of all the people here,

841
00:42:01,977 --> 00:42:03,896
I have the most fun when I'm with you.

842
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:06,148
Me too.

843
00:42:06,232 --> 00:42:08,817
Now that we're better friends, you're so funny

844
00:42:08,901 --> 00:42:12,363
and you have great reactions and you're super kind.

845
00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:15,991
[both chuckle]

846
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:19,203
You really are. Even right now, I think it's kind of crazy.

847
00:42:20,496 --> 00:42:23,791
On the first day, I had no idea that I'd become so close with you.

848
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:26,752
Yeah, I actually thought that too.

849
00:42:26,835 --> 00:42:29,046
I didn't think I'd be friends with you.

850
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:31,757
But on the second or third day,

851
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:35,219
I realized, "Oh, we have similar senses of humor."

852
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:38,639
Uh, it was like, "I could be friends with him."

853
00:42:38,722 --> 00:42:40,641
Or "I'm going to be friends with him."

854
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:43,269
As for your first impression,

855
00:42:43,352 --> 00:42:44,728
when I opened the door,

856
00:42:44,812 --> 00:42:47,690
you were the first one there, you were right there.

857
00:42:47,773 --> 00:42:51,902
When I walked in, your eyes were kind of super intense.

858
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:54,905
So when I walked into the classroom for the first time,

859
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:57,283
your face was the only thing that I could see.

860
00:42:57,366 --> 00:42:59,702
"Huh? Oh, he's handsome."

861
00:42:59,785 --> 00:43:01,203
[Ji-min] Really?

862
00:43:04,206 --> 00:43:07,209
FIRST DAY AT SCHOOL 19

863
00:43:07,293 --> 00:43:09,128
-[Sang-won] Hello. -[Jung-yun] Hello.

864
00:43:09,712 --> 00:43:11,338
[in Korean] Hello. [chuckles]

865
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:13,465
Hello. [chuckles]

866
00:43:13,549 --> 00:43:16,468
[in English] When I opened the door and went inside,

867
00:43:16,552 --> 00:43:21,849
I immediately made eye contact with a guy named Lee Ji-min.

868
00:43:22,641 --> 00:43:24,852
"Wow, he's hot."

869
00:43:26,562 --> 00:43:28,564
I want to be friends with Ye-rin.

870
00:43:29,231 --> 00:43:32,735
When I first saw her, she seemed very cold.

871
00:43:33,819 --> 00:43:36,113
So, I want to try to be friends with her.

872
00:43:36,196 --> 00:43:37,281
At first it was like,

873
00:43:37,364 --> 00:43:39,867
"We should be friends and we have the same sense of humor."

874
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:43,495
And right now it's like, "Wow, this is awesome."

875
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:46,123
Best friends, right?

876
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:53,714
-Oh, they're not just friends. -They're not just friends.

877
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:56,550
-There's that subtle… -[Ji-eun] There's something between them.

878
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:59,136
-There's tension between them. -It's very subtle, though.

879
00:43:59,219 --> 00:44:02,431
Right now, they're both saying, "We're friends. We're friends."

880
00:44:02,514 --> 00:44:05,142
-But they're definitely not just friends. -Yeah, they're not.

881
00:44:05,225 --> 00:44:07,645
-It's making me a bit excited. -Definitely not.

882
00:44:08,437 --> 00:44:10,314
[waiter] Let me pour this for you.

883
00:44:10,397 --> 00:44:13,025
[Ye-rin] Oh, wow. Look at the glass.

884
00:44:13,108 --> 00:44:14,360
[Ji-min] Whoa.

885
00:44:14,443 --> 00:44:15,486
[waiter] Enjoy.

886
00:44:15,569 --> 00:44:17,154
-[Ye-rin] Thank you. -Thank you.

887
00:44:17,237 --> 00:44:20,783
-Wow. This place has great atmosphere. -Yeah.

888
00:44:20,866 --> 00:44:22,993
I really like cozy places.

889
00:44:23,077 --> 00:44:25,663
The atmosphere's so nice. There's this too.

890
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:29,166
What about me? I'm here too.

891
00:44:29,249 --> 00:44:31,877
You're the best part about this place.

892
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:34,046
[giggling]

893
00:44:34,797 --> 00:44:36,757
Wow, Ji-min.

894
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:38,634
Ji-min, wow.

895
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:41,762
How do you feel about this date with me today?

896
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:43,555
Best decision you've ever made, right?

897
00:44:43,639 --> 00:44:44,598
Of course.

898
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:46,517
I have no regrets.

899
00:44:47,142 --> 00:44:48,394
Hm. Me neither.

900
00:44:48,477 --> 00:44:51,271
I was planning on hanging out with you as friends,

901
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:53,148
but I think I like you a lot more than that.

902
00:44:53,232 --> 00:44:55,234
-[Ye-rin] Really? -Mm-hmm. [chuckles]

903
00:44:56,402 --> 00:44:57,486
[chuckles]

904
00:44:59,446 --> 00:45:00,656
[Ji-min clears throat]

905
00:45:01,573 --> 00:45:02,950
[continues chuckling]

906
00:45:07,413 --> 00:45:10,749
-Oh! Why is he… Why is he acting so shy? -[Se-woon] Oh, he just…

907
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:13,961
I told you. That's what this show's all about.

908
00:45:15,045 --> 00:45:18,006
You're the first person I've been on a date with as an adult.

909
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:20,217
So you're my first date.

910
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:25,389
[waiter] And here are your meals.

911
00:45:25,472 --> 00:45:28,016
-Thank you. -[waiter] This is the seasoned brisket…

912
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:30,185
-[Ji-min] Looks delicious. -…egg salad.

913
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:32,729
Tastes even better when you mix it with the cold pasta.

914
00:45:32,813 --> 00:45:33,939
[Ye-rin] Oh, okay.

915
00:45:34,022 --> 00:45:35,858
-[waiter] Enjoy. -[both] Thank you.

916
00:45:35,941 --> 00:45:37,109
Brisket.

917
00:45:37,192 --> 00:45:40,028
-Oh, hold on. I need to tie my hair back. -Wine, nice.

918
00:45:40,112 --> 00:45:41,113
Wine.

919
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:46,410
I need to tie my hair back when I'm eating.

920
00:45:52,291 --> 00:45:54,293
[slow romantic music playing]

921
00:46:01,508 --> 00:46:02,926
[Ye-rin] Does it look good?

922
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:04,344
Ugh, it doesn't.

923
00:46:09,308 --> 00:46:10,476
Take your time.

924
00:46:12,144 --> 00:46:13,479
Is it good?

925
00:46:13,562 --> 00:46:14,563
Does it look good?

926
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:17,232
-You look pretty. -[Ye-rin] Let's go.

927
00:46:17,316 --> 00:46:18,942
Wow, he just fell for her.

928
00:46:19,026 --> 00:46:22,362
[Su-hyun] There should be subtitles like, "Can't take his eyes off of her."

929
00:46:22,446 --> 00:46:25,282
We don't know what'll happen with these two, either.

930
00:46:25,365 --> 00:46:28,285
-Let's eat. Bon appétit. -Let's eat.

931
00:46:32,956 --> 00:46:36,668
-Cheers. -Which way should I drink it?

932
00:46:37,252 --> 00:46:38,253
I don't know.

933
00:46:46,094 --> 00:46:46,929
[Ji-min] Hm.

934
00:46:48,347 --> 00:46:49,181
Mm.

935
00:46:51,975 --> 00:46:52,976
Hm.

936
00:46:53,810 --> 00:46:57,064
Out of everything I've tried so far, this one is the least bitter.

937
00:46:57,147 --> 00:46:59,608
-I'm gonna eat this. -Oh, this one's good.

938
00:47:03,237 --> 00:47:04,071
Hm.

939
00:47:05,155 --> 00:47:06,281
[chuckles]

940
00:47:09,284 --> 00:47:11,036
-Hm. -[Ji-min] Hm.

941
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:13,288
[chuckles]

942
00:47:15,624 --> 00:47:17,543
[Ji-min] The pasta is so good.

943
00:47:17,626 --> 00:47:19,086
[chuckles]

944
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:20,837
Hm.

945
00:47:28,845 --> 00:47:29,763
[Ye-rin] Wow.

946
00:47:34,893 --> 00:47:36,603
[Ji-min] The wine isn't my type.

947
00:47:39,648 --> 00:47:40,774
Help me, brisket.

948
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:43,318
Help me.

949
00:47:43,402 --> 00:47:46,697
Being an adult is hard. Drinking is hard.

950
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:48,740
-It's good, though. -Already?

951
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:54,830
Hey, excuse me.

952
00:47:54,913 --> 00:47:56,623
Are you drunk?

953
00:47:56,707 --> 00:47:58,000
The top…

954
00:47:58,083 --> 00:48:01,169
Huh? I'm not drunk. I just didn't know it was closed.

955
00:48:03,255 --> 00:48:04,881
Oh, why am I so stupid?

956
00:48:05,757 --> 00:48:08,385
[quirky music playing]

957
00:48:12,764 --> 00:48:14,308
[exclaims softly]

958
00:48:14,391 --> 00:48:15,392
Whoa, whoa.

959
00:48:20,147 --> 00:48:21,690
Say that I…

960
00:48:25,819 --> 00:48:27,487
go on a dream date…

961
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:30,282
That I ask you out on that date.

962
00:48:31,074 --> 00:48:34,161
Do you think it would feel different

963
00:48:34,953 --> 00:48:37,122
from when we decided to go out yesterday?

964
00:48:37,205 --> 00:48:40,000
-It would be totally different. -Really?

965
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:42,628
Honestly, spending time with you right now,

966
00:48:43,629 --> 00:48:45,339
it feels different already.

967
00:48:45,922 --> 00:48:48,759
Yesterday, we both just wanted to go to Lotte World Adventure,

968
00:48:48,842 --> 00:48:51,011
but we were both feeling uncertain.

969
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:55,057
Still, I felt so thankful when you sent me a signal back there.

970
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:58,727
Because you were willing to use your ticket.

971
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:04,691
So I think I'll be even happier to go with you this time.

972
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:07,944
It's no pressure, though. You can go with Ji-woo if you want.

973
00:49:11,948 --> 00:49:15,243
When are you planning on using up your dream date?

974
00:49:15,994 --> 00:49:17,120
[Ye-rin] Hm…

975
00:49:17,704 --> 00:49:19,581
I haven't really thought about that.

976
00:49:22,501 --> 00:49:24,961
But if I'm like, "Oh, I want to do that one."

977
00:49:25,045 --> 00:49:27,547
I think I'll go on that date no matter what.

978
00:49:27,631 --> 00:49:30,217
Well, it's up to you,

979
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:34,513
but if you asked me out, I would be totally open to saying yes.

980
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:39,267
If I ask you out, though,

981
00:49:39,935 --> 00:49:42,521
we won't be able to go on another one again.

982
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:46,316
-True. -Then you could choose Ji-woo.

983
00:49:47,567 --> 00:49:48,735
Oh, no, oh, no.

984
00:49:50,112 --> 00:49:51,613
So, you're being jealous, too.

985
00:49:53,031 --> 00:49:53,907
I like it.

986
00:49:53,990 --> 00:49:55,659
You get jealous too, right?

987
00:49:56,284 --> 00:49:57,786
Super jealous.

988
00:49:59,705 --> 00:50:00,539
[Ye-rin] Hm…

989
00:50:07,379 --> 00:50:09,089
I think I like you even more now.

990
00:50:10,257 --> 00:50:11,091
Me?

991
00:50:13,719 --> 00:50:15,887
[both laughing]

992
00:50:17,389 --> 00:50:20,892
Uh, are you starting to like me more in real-time?

993
00:50:20,976 --> 00:50:21,810
Yeah.

994
00:50:22,602 --> 00:50:24,688
Me? You, too?

995
00:50:26,565 --> 00:50:28,024
That's good.

996
00:50:28,108 --> 00:50:32,237
The more I think about how we get along… I mean, we just get along.

997
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:35,657
When things are fun, we can have fun together.

998
00:50:35,741 --> 00:50:37,868
And we can be serious together. It's nice.

999
00:50:40,579 --> 00:50:42,831
I'm worried about Ji-woo all of a sudden.

1000
00:50:42,914 --> 00:50:43,999
[chuckles]

1001
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,001
[Ji-min] So you…

1002
00:50:47,085 --> 00:50:49,504
You're starting to like me more, right?

1003
00:50:51,047 --> 00:50:53,842
I hope that you'll start liking me more than Se-yeon.

1004
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:56,136
I want to turn the tables.

1005
00:50:57,095 --> 00:50:58,013
It's possible.

1006
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:00,056
Ooh.

1007
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:03,602
-Ji-min will have a change of heart. -He'll have a change of heart.

1008
00:51:03,685 --> 00:51:06,480
-Things are tiring right now. -He feels more stable now.

1009
00:51:06,563 --> 00:51:09,399
He's experienced the happiness that comes from stability.

1010
00:51:10,108 --> 00:51:12,235
So, I've been curious.

1011
00:51:12,861 --> 00:51:16,281
I wanted to know if I feel this way about you because we're friends,

1012
00:51:16,364 --> 00:51:18,450
or because I'm attracted to you as a guy.

1013
00:51:19,576 --> 00:51:21,161
Well, it was a surprise.

1014
00:51:21,244 --> 00:51:23,997
You looked so pretty when you were tying up your hair.

1015
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:25,624
[both chuckle]

1016
00:51:26,625 --> 00:51:29,795
[chuckles] Can I untie it, then put it back up?

1017
00:51:35,175 --> 00:51:36,176
[Ye-rin] Mm-mmm.

1018
00:51:43,141 --> 00:51:43,975
Hm.

1019
00:51:44,810 --> 00:51:48,980
-Oh… You finished it? -Wanna pour the rest of it right now?

1020
00:51:49,064 --> 00:51:51,525
-Yeah, give me some. -Let's split the rest of it.

1021
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:55,737
[Ye-rin exclaims softly]

1022
00:51:55,821 --> 00:51:57,739
[in Korean] It's full. [laughs]

1023
00:52:00,992 --> 00:52:01,827
[exclaims]

1024
00:52:02,536 --> 00:52:03,662
[Ye-rin, in English] Oh, no.

1025
00:52:03,745 --> 00:52:06,706
-This is bad. -We'll be drunk going back to the house.

1026
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:07,624
Perfect.

1027
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:15,006
[quirky music playing]

1028
00:52:17,843 --> 00:52:18,677
Oh.

1029
00:52:21,054 --> 00:52:22,848
I can't focus my eyes.

1030
00:52:23,723 --> 00:52:25,016
Focus, focus.

1031
00:52:26,268 --> 00:52:28,103
It feels nice to be drunk, though.

1032
00:52:28,854 --> 00:52:30,939
Give me… Give me your cup.

1033
00:52:31,022 --> 00:52:32,190
Barley, barley.

1034
00:52:32,274 --> 00:52:34,651
I can't focus my eyes either. Oh, wow.

1035
00:52:34,734 --> 00:52:37,195
Hey, your aim is way off right now.

1036
00:52:37,279 --> 00:52:38,530
That's good, that's good.

1037
00:52:44,619 --> 00:52:46,288
-[Ye-rin laughs] -Oh.

1038
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:48,790
I feel a bit more sober now.

1039
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:51,668
The others will be surprised

1040
00:52:51,751 --> 00:52:54,880
when we get back to the house because we're both drunk.

1041
00:52:54,963 --> 00:52:56,256
-Let's go. -Want to go?

1042
00:52:56,339 --> 00:52:57,757
-Okay. -Let's go back.

1043
00:52:57,841 --> 00:52:59,634
[Kyuhyun] Oh, I think we were too…

1044
00:52:59,718 --> 00:53:01,511
Things were going the way we wanted.

1045
00:53:01,595 --> 00:53:04,472
-We were getting too deep into it. -That was fun.

1046
00:53:04,556 --> 00:53:07,183
I think Ji-min's feelings will change significantly.

1047
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:10,020
Originally, today was like,

1048
00:53:10,103 --> 00:53:12,397
-"Hey, let's hang out!" -"Just friends."

1049
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:14,816
-Putting her hair up-- -Yeah, that was no joke.

1050
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:16,484
[Ji-eun] Do guys like that stuff?

1051
00:53:16,568 --> 00:53:18,862
-I mean, we die, seriously. -Really?

1052
00:53:18,945 --> 00:53:20,113
-Really? -[Se-woon] Really?

1053
00:53:20,196 --> 00:53:22,532
Honestly, I'm not really sure about that.

1054
00:53:22,616 --> 00:53:24,659
But if they're already attracted to each other,

1055
00:53:24,743 --> 00:53:26,077
-then it's more-- -You die?

1056
00:53:26,161 --> 00:53:30,874
Personally, if a woman ties her hair in front of me, I just stare at her.

1057
00:53:30,957 --> 00:53:33,043
-[Ji-eun] You die? -[Su-hyun] So, like Ji-min?

1058
00:53:33,126 --> 00:53:34,836
-Not that bad. -[Se-woon] Ji-min is really…

1059
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:37,797
Like Su-hyun said, these things can happen in a heartbeat.

1060
00:53:37,881 --> 00:53:39,466
-[Su-hyun] Of course. -So quick.

1061
00:53:39,549 --> 00:53:41,384
Ji-min and Ye-rin are straightforward,

1062
00:53:41,468 --> 00:53:42,969
-so they both… -True.

1063
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:44,054
They get along.

1064
00:53:44,137 --> 00:53:46,264
They didn't try hide the way they feel.

1065
00:53:46,348 --> 00:53:48,934
-Yeah. I like this couple. -I loved watching them.

1066
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:51,561
[Ji-min] Watch out.

1067
00:53:52,354 --> 00:53:54,773
-[Pyeong-seok, in Korean] Well… -[Ji-min] Huh?

1068
00:53:55,273 --> 00:53:59,194
-[Pyeong-seok, in English] Back so soon? -I think we've been out for three hours.

1069
00:53:59,277 --> 00:54:00,445
Somebody's back.

1070
00:54:01,112 --> 00:54:02,072
[Seo-hyeon] Who?

1071
00:54:02,155 --> 00:54:03,365
Is it Ji-min and Ye-rin?

1072
00:54:03,448 --> 00:54:05,784
[Seo-hyeon] Why is Ye-rin wearing shorts in this weather?

1073
00:54:05,867 --> 00:54:08,828
-[Pyeong-seok] Did you guys drink? -[Ji-min] We drank a lot.

1074
00:54:08,912 --> 00:54:12,082
-Hey, you look pretty drunk. -[Ji-min] I need to lie down for a bit.

1075
00:54:12,165 --> 00:54:14,292
-[Se-yeon] What, what? -[Hee-ji] What?

1076
00:54:14,376 --> 00:54:15,961
Is Ye-rin drunk?

1077
00:54:16,044 --> 00:54:17,671
Hey, Hee-ji, go and help her.

1078
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:21,549
Hey, you okay?

1079
00:54:21,633 --> 00:54:22,717
[Seo-yeong] Ye-rin.

1080
00:54:23,468 --> 00:54:24,427
Hey.

1081
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:26,471
-You can't stand up straight. -I drank most of it.

1082
00:54:26,554 --> 00:54:28,640
-What's up with you? -She doesn't smell like alcohol.

1083
00:54:28,723 --> 00:54:30,517
-I can snap-- -[Hee-ji] Be quiet.

1084
00:54:31,226 --> 00:54:33,353
[Ji-min] Where should I go? Please tell me.

1085
00:54:33,436 --> 00:54:35,438
-I got him. -I'll be on the second floor.

1086
00:54:35,522 --> 00:54:38,817
Change into something comfortable, splash water on your face, and rest.

1087
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:40,068
[Ji-min] Yeah. Okay.

1088
00:54:40,652 --> 00:54:42,112
How much did you drink?

1089
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:46,199
EXCESSIVE ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION IS HARMFUL

1090
00:54:46,282 --> 00:54:47,867
IF YOU'RE CAUGHT DRINKING TOO MUCH, YOU'LL LOSE YOUR DREAM DATE

1091
00:54:47,951 --> 00:54:50,662
Come here, come here, come here, come here.

1092
00:54:52,205 --> 00:54:53,039
I say yes.

1093
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:54,749
[Sang-won] I say yes. I agree.

1094
00:54:55,917 --> 00:54:57,085
Who wrote…

1095
00:54:58,253 --> 00:54:59,254
[Se-yeon] Popped up.

1096
00:54:59,337 --> 00:55:01,840
-[Pyeong-seok] Popped up. -[Sang-won] It just appeared.

1097
00:55:01,923 --> 00:55:05,885
"If you're caught drinking too much, you'll lose your dream date ticket."

1098
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:09,222
Does it count as drinking too much if two people share one bottle?

1099
00:55:09,305 --> 00:55:12,475
-I guess, it's telling-- -If you drink more than you can handle…

1100
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:14,728
Stop before you get drunk? Hm.

1101
00:55:24,029 --> 00:55:25,739
Shouldn't you go to bed?

1102
00:55:28,783 --> 00:55:31,327
-Ye-rin, eat half a plate. -That looks good.

1103
00:55:31,411 --> 00:55:32,662
Ye-rin, eat half a plate.

1104
00:55:32,746 --> 00:55:35,248
Hey, hey. Don't even let her get close to alcohol.

1105
00:55:35,331 --> 00:55:37,500
[glass clinking]

1106
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:39,961
Thank you.

1107
00:55:42,297 --> 00:55:45,717
Don't you think she'll sober up faster if she eats some food, though?

1108
00:55:47,093 --> 00:55:50,138
Well, you've got to stay alert when you're not home.

1109
00:55:51,556 --> 00:55:53,808
I swear I only drank one and a half glasses.

1110
00:55:53,892 --> 00:55:56,269
[Sang-won] That can be a lot of alcohol for you.

1111
00:55:56,352 --> 00:55:58,938
-It's different for everybody. -[Pyeong-seok] Right.

1112
00:56:00,774 --> 00:56:02,650
Want more? You're eating so well.

1113
00:56:03,234 --> 00:56:06,780
Here. Give them to me. You can eat mine, too. Eat it all.

1114
00:56:13,203 --> 00:56:15,955
Only drink half a glass when you drink wine, okay?

1115
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:18,416
Not even a full glass. Half a glass, okay?

1116
00:56:23,129 --> 00:56:24,756
Do you want to shower, Ye-rin?

1117
00:56:27,383 --> 00:56:29,385
[clears throat] I'm going to shower.

1118
00:56:30,261 --> 00:56:32,013
Don't fall asleep in the shower.

1119
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:33,723
[Seo-hyeon] Let's go.

1120
00:56:33,807 --> 00:56:35,767
SANG-WON &amp; SEO-HYEON'S DREAM DATE

1121
00:56:35,850 --> 00:56:38,311
-Wow, I'm so excited. -[Sang-won] Yeah.

1122
00:56:38,394 --> 00:56:40,021
Oh, Lotte World Adventure?

1123
00:56:40,105 --> 00:56:42,148
-They're going? -Wow, I'm so jealous.

1124
00:56:42,232 --> 00:56:43,983
It must be so pretty at night, too.

1125
00:56:44,067 --> 00:56:46,528
Yeah, and they'll be the only ones there.

1126
00:56:47,487 --> 00:56:50,031
[Seo-hyeon] Wow, I can't believe it.

1127
00:56:50,115 --> 00:56:51,324
I can't believe it.

1128
00:56:51,407 --> 00:56:53,701
I signed up for it the second I saw it.

1129
00:56:54,702 --> 00:56:57,539
This means you'll ask someone else out on a dream date.

1130
00:56:57,622 --> 00:56:58,498
[Seo-hyeon] Hey.

1131
00:56:59,207 --> 00:57:00,750
-What… -We can talk in the car.

1132
00:57:04,796 --> 00:57:06,131
-Hello. -[driver] Welcome.

1133
00:57:06,214 --> 00:57:07,215
[Sang-won] Hello.

1134
00:57:09,342 --> 00:57:11,302
-I'm so excited. -[Seo-hyeon] Me too.

1135
00:57:11,386 --> 00:57:12,846
-[Sang-won] You excited? -Yes.

1136
00:57:12,929 --> 00:57:14,764
-[Sang-won] Great. -This will be fun.

1137
00:57:16,057 --> 00:57:17,433
How do I look today?

1138
00:57:17,517 --> 00:57:21,062
You're wearing black, white, and denim.

1139
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:25,316
-Do you like it? -You're stylin'. I love your outfit.

1140
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:28,778
-Other than fashion, how about me? -Of course I like you too.

1141
00:57:29,696 --> 00:57:32,157
-Wow, I can't believe it. -What?

1142
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:33,908
You just…

1143
00:57:34,617 --> 00:57:35,452
Okay.

1144
00:57:35,535 --> 00:57:38,538
-I'll have to be on high alert. -What?

1145
00:57:38,621 --> 00:57:40,457
I'll be on high alert.

1146
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:43,042
-What do you want to do when we get there? -Me?

1147
00:57:44,169 --> 00:57:46,546
Uh, I want to take a picture there.

1148
00:57:46,629 --> 00:57:48,715
The place where everyone takes a picture?

1149
00:57:48,798 --> 00:57:50,842
-The carousel or the castle? -The castle.

1150
00:57:50,925 --> 00:57:54,012
-There's always a huge line there. -The line is so--

1151
00:57:54,095 --> 00:57:55,847
I've never managed to take a picture there.

1152
00:57:55,930 --> 00:57:58,933
Just the two of us at Lotte World Adventure? Wow.

1153
00:58:03,396 --> 00:58:05,356
-Do you need any help? -Oh, no, no.

1154
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:08,401
Uh, could you clean up a bit over there? There, over there.

1155
00:58:09,068 --> 00:58:11,404
What? Oh, do you want to do it with him?

1156
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:13,490
[laughs] I'll do it.

1157
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:17,118
Wash your hands and go. Wash your hands and go.

1158
00:58:19,370 --> 00:58:21,664
-I'm actually going to shower. -Go and shower.

1159
00:58:23,416 --> 00:58:24,709
Wow, chef.

1160
00:58:27,003 --> 00:58:28,171
Chef, are you tired?

1161
00:58:29,631 --> 00:58:32,133
-You look like you're dead tired. -Just a bit.

1162
00:58:32,217 --> 00:58:33,593
Your ears are still red.

1163
00:58:34,302 --> 00:58:36,471
Why are my ears so red?

1164
00:58:36,554 --> 00:58:38,473
Yeah, why are your ears always red?

1165
00:58:39,224 --> 00:58:40,725
Hm, I don't know.

1166
00:58:40,808 --> 00:58:42,185
[Hee-ji chuckles]

1167
00:58:45,063 --> 00:58:48,525
I really enjoyed the food today. I didn't eat a lot, but I'm full.

1168
00:58:48,608 --> 00:58:49,901
Oh, right.

1169
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:52,695
You're a great cook.

1170
00:58:54,614 --> 00:58:56,199
Do you cook for yourself often?

1171
00:58:57,158 --> 00:58:59,494
-Sometimes. -Sometimes?

1172
00:58:59,577 --> 00:59:00,578
Sometimes.

1173
00:59:01,412 --> 00:59:04,415
I also like to follow recipes and stuff.

1174
00:59:06,084 --> 00:59:07,752
It doesn't really roll up.

1175
00:59:07,835 --> 00:59:10,004
-[laughs] -Wow, look at your muscles.

1176
00:59:10,713 --> 00:59:11,714
[Hee-ji chuckles]

1177
00:59:12,382 --> 00:59:15,176
[all exclaiming]

1178
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:17,637
-Pyeong-seok. -Wow, Pyeong-seok.

1179
00:59:18,596 --> 00:59:21,349
-Pyeong-seok! -This isn't anything special, why--

1180
00:59:21,432 --> 00:59:23,560
[Su-hyun] Those things can be really romantic.

1181
00:59:23,643 --> 00:59:27,981
[Hee-ji laughing]

1182
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:30,441
[Hee-ji] Here.

1183
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:33,570
Yeah, it's really hard to roll them up.

1184
00:59:35,321 --> 00:59:36,322
Thank you.

1185
00:59:39,367 --> 00:59:40,618
Scrub, scrub.

1186
00:59:44,289 --> 00:59:45,290
Final check.

1187
00:59:46,791 --> 00:59:48,626
Oh! They're so cute…

1188
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:50,962
Why are they acting like newlyweds here?

1189
00:59:51,045 --> 00:59:52,547
This is driving me crazy.

1190
00:59:52,630 --> 00:59:53,881
Right? This is crazy.

1191
00:59:53,965 --> 00:59:55,300
[Su-hyun] They're so cute.

1192
01:00:00,513 --> 01:00:01,514
[yawns]

1193
01:00:11,858 --> 01:00:14,777
[upbeat music playing]

1194
01:00:24,203 --> 01:00:25,330
[Ji-min] Um…

1195
01:00:26,122 --> 01:00:29,000
-I'm… -We're going bowling. Bowling.

1196
01:00:29,083 --> 01:00:30,209
We're going bowling.

1197
01:00:30,293 --> 01:00:31,711
It'll be super fun.

1198
01:00:42,764 --> 01:00:45,391
Oh, wow, he's looking at the pictures from today.

1199
01:00:45,475 --> 01:00:46,309
Oh, that's cute.

1200
01:00:46,392 --> 01:00:49,479
-Looking at the pictures from the date. -[Se-woon] Like they're dating.

1201
01:00:49,562 --> 01:00:50,772
That's so…

1202
01:00:50,855 --> 01:00:52,774
Oh, he's so innocent.

1203
01:00:57,987 --> 01:00:59,238
[Seo-yeong] How was it?

1204
01:01:01,032 --> 01:01:03,660
-[Ji-woo] Is this everyone? -[Jung-yun] What are you doing?

1205
01:01:03,743 --> 01:01:05,203
[Ji-woo] I'm going to change.

1206
01:01:08,373 --> 01:01:11,709
-You're finally awake. -[Ye-rin] You're gonna shower, right?

1207
01:01:11,793 --> 01:01:13,878
-[Hee-ji] Were you sleeping? -No, I've been awake.

1208
01:01:13,961 --> 01:01:16,172
I noticed that thing changed!

1209
01:01:16,255 --> 01:01:17,965
-It's different. -They came like this.

1210
01:01:18,049 --> 01:01:19,300
-Come here. -What's different?

1211
01:01:19,384 --> 01:01:22,220
About drinking too much. They changed it because of us.

1212
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:25,348
If you drink too much, you'll lose your dream date ticket.

1213
01:01:25,431 --> 01:01:26,641
That appeared because of us.

1214
01:01:26,724 --> 01:01:28,351
[Jung-yun] Don't drink too much, okay?

1215
01:01:28,434 --> 01:01:30,853
[Ji-min] Yeah. I was staggering when I came in.

1216
01:01:30,937 --> 01:01:33,147
-[Ye-rin] Oh, my. -Do you remember it?

1217
01:01:33,231 --> 01:01:35,149
-What? Coming back? -Remember? Yeah.

1218
01:01:35,233 --> 01:01:38,695
-I remember. Yeah. -You sure you didn't forget everything?

1219
01:01:38,778 --> 01:01:42,573
-Yeah, I didn't forget. I remember. -You went through a factory reset.

1220
01:01:42,657 --> 01:01:45,326
You know, my heart was beating so fast after drinking.

1221
01:01:45,410 --> 01:01:47,912
-You know what I'm talking about, right? -I had no idea.

1222
01:01:47,995 --> 01:01:49,414
I could hear it.

1223
01:01:49,497 --> 01:01:51,332
It was like… [mimics heart pounding]

1224
01:01:51,416 --> 01:01:54,627
-[Ji-min] Can't drink more than that. -I was about to shower, it was all red.

1225
01:01:54,711 --> 01:01:56,003
I was so surprised.

1226
01:01:56,587 --> 01:01:58,631
I was looking through my pictures.

1227
01:01:58,715 --> 01:02:00,925
-So I was looking through my pictures. -Yeah.

1228
01:02:01,008 --> 01:02:02,844
Did I send you all of the pictures?

1229
01:02:02,927 --> 01:02:04,762
-[Ji-min] You didn't. -I sent this one.

1230
01:02:04,846 --> 01:02:07,598
-[Ji-min] That's the only one you sent. -What the heck?

1231
01:02:07,682 --> 01:02:10,518
-Why do you look good in that one? Why? -This one?

1232
01:02:10,601 --> 01:02:12,854
It's the goldfish one. It's the goldfish meme.

1233
01:02:15,773 --> 01:02:17,400
Oh, I need to stop eating.

1234
01:02:18,359 --> 01:02:20,737
I'll leave this place looking like mochi bread.

1235
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:22,321
-Mochi bread. -[Ye-rin laughs]

1236
01:02:22,405 --> 01:02:24,323
-It's dangerous. -[Ji-min] Mochi bread.

1237
01:02:25,366 --> 01:02:26,743
Yeah. That's cute.

1238
01:02:26,826 --> 01:02:28,995
Mochi bread. That's just adorable.

1239
01:02:34,709 --> 01:02:36,127
Want to go upstairs?

1240
01:02:37,086 --> 01:02:39,005
Oh, second floor? Anywhere?

1241
01:02:44,218 --> 01:02:45,052
[sighs]

1242
01:02:46,304 --> 01:02:49,098
-She glanced at him. -She glanced as he was leaving.

1243
01:02:49,182 --> 01:02:50,600
Oh, Ye-rin definitely--

1244
01:02:50,683 --> 01:02:53,311
Yeah. I think she's still thinking about Se-yeon.

1245
01:02:55,438 --> 01:02:57,940
I don't even know how to describe how I feel today.

1246
01:02:59,108 --> 01:03:00,193
[Se-yeon sighs]

1247
01:03:00,276 --> 01:03:03,321
What this… What kind of emotion is this?

1248
01:03:03,404 --> 01:03:04,405
[Se-yeon exhales]

1249
01:03:04,989 --> 01:03:08,075
I just never felt this emotion in the past 19 years.

1250
01:03:08,159 --> 01:03:10,203
19 years. Oh, it's 20 years now.

1251
01:03:12,914 --> 01:03:14,999
I don't know how I feel right now.

1252
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:17,543
I just feel like I'm a bit on edge.

1253
01:03:17,627 --> 01:03:19,629
[sighs] That must be complicated.

1254
01:03:19,712 --> 01:03:21,547
-It's so complicated. -So complicated.

1255
01:03:22,256 --> 01:03:24,967
Honestly, it's for the best.

1256
01:03:25,718 --> 01:03:29,138
I'm glad that I went to Ye-rin and talked about this.

1257
01:03:29,222 --> 01:03:30,306
[Pyeong-seok] Yeah.

1258
01:03:30,890 --> 01:03:33,810
If I dragged things out, not talking to her about it,

1259
01:03:34,519 --> 01:03:36,854
Ye-rin would have kept feeling that way toward me.

1260
01:03:36,938 --> 01:03:38,272
I can see something's different

1261
01:03:38,356 --> 01:03:40,566
-with the two of them. -[Se-yeon] Yeah.

1262
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:41,567
But now…

1263
01:03:43,027 --> 01:03:45,571
I just feel so confused and conflicted.

1264
01:03:46,656 --> 01:03:50,660
I'm still feeling this way even after telling her exactly how I feel.

1265
01:03:50,743 --> 01:03:53,079
I don't know if I did the right thing yesterday.

1266
01:03:54,789 --> 01:03:56,791
Wow, I don't know.

1267
01:03:59,544 --> 01:04:00,378
[sighs]

1268
01:04:02,213 --> 01:04:03,214
[sighs]

1269
01:04:03,297 --> 01:04:05,925
-When you were talking with Hee-ji… -Hm.

1270
01:04:06,008 --> 01:04:08,928
-I went upstairs with Ye-rin to talk. -Really?

1271
01:04:10,805 --> 01:04:13,808
She asked me out on a date for tomorrow.

1272
01:04:13,891 --> 01:04:15,184
She asked you?

1273
01:04:15,268 --> 01:04:16,978
-Ye-rin did? -Yeah.

1274
01:04:17,061 --> 01:04:20,064
-Seriously? -She wants to be friends with everybody.

1275
01:04:20,147 --> 01:04:21,399
Wow, really?

1276
01:04:22,567 --> 01:04:23,401
[sighs]

1277
01:04:25,069 --> 01:04:29,699
So, I thought that Ye-rin just wanted to go on a regular date with me.

1278
01:04:29,782 --> 01:04:32,326
-Was it a dream date? Seriously? -Yeah.

1279
01:04:33,703 --> 01:04:36,747
-Wow, really? -I didn't see that coming. Really.

1280
01:04:36,831 --> 01:04:38,666
She asked you out on a dream date?

1281
01:04:39,542 --> 01:04:41,544
"Wow, what's going on? I…"

1282
01:04:42,837 --> 01:04:44,046
A dream date.

1283
01:04:44,130 --> 01:04:47,425
[Se-yeon clicks tongue]

1284
01:04:47,508 --> 01:04:50,177
[sighs] What are you going to do about the dream date?

1285
01:04:51,596 --> 01:04:53,681
For the one dream date that we get,

1286
01:04:53,764 --> 01:04:58,060
I really want to have some degree of certainty when I go on that date,

1287
01:04:58,144 --> 01:04:59,937
even if I can't be completely sure.

1288
01:05:00,021 --> 01:05:02,648
It's really meaningful, and you can only use it once.

1289
01:05:04,233 --> 01:05:05,234
Hm.

1290
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:07,194
[Se-yeon sighs]

1291
01:05:12,575 --> 01:05:16,579
Regardless of that, uh, up until now,

1292
01:05:16,662 --> 01:05:18,039
Se-yeon was kind of

1293
01:05:18,122 --> 01:05:20,124
trying to distance himself from Ye-rin.

1294
01:05:20,207 --> 01:05:21,250
[Su-hyun] Now he's--

1295
01:05:21,334 --> 01:05:23,794
But now that Ye-rin has become close to Ji-min…

1296
01:05:23,878 --> 01:05:24,837
[Ji-eun] Right.

1297
01:05:24,921 --> 01:05:26,339
…he feels a little…

1298
01:05:26,422 --> 01:05:29,592
-[Ji-eun] He's not happy with it. -[Kyuhyun] He has mixed feelings.

1299
01:05:29,675 --> 01:05:32,678
Don't you think that Ye-rin still likes Se-yeon a little bit?

1300
01:05:32,762 --> 01:05:35,640
Still, I want Ye-rin to get more love.

1301
01:05:35,723 --> 01:05:36,724
[Ji-eun] Right.

1302
01:05:36,807 --> 01:05:40,019
So I want her to get over her feelings for Se-yeon quickly,

1303
01:05:40,102 --> 01:05:43,189
-and just be with Ji-min. -[Ji-eun] Right.

1304
01:05:49,487 --> 01:05:51,280
Seo-yeong, you okay?

1305
01:05:51,364 --> 01:05:52,365
Oh, Hee-ji?

1306
01:05:52,448 --> 01:05:55,076
Oh, I'm not feeling so great right now.

1307
01:05:55,159 --> 01:05:57,995
Well, we can talk for a bit.

1308
01:05:59,372 --> 01:06:01,123
How are things for you?

1309
01:06:02,291 --> 01:06:04,961
How would you rank the guys that you like right now?

1310
01:06:05,044 --> 01:06:07,380
I only have one at the top.

1311
01:06:07,463 --> 01:06:09,006
-[whispers] Pyeong-seok? -Hm.

1312
01:06:11,050 --> 01:06:12,468
I'm curious, though.

1313
01:06:12,551 --> 01:06:15,429
-What exactly do you like… -[chuckles]

1314
01:06:15,513 --> 01:06:17,264
…about Pyeong-seok?

1315
01:06:18,182 --> 01:06:19,642
Uh, he's cute.

1316
01:06:19,725 --> 01:06:20,893
He's cute.

1317
01:06:21,894 --> 01:06:24,522
He just has such a pretty smile.

1318
01:06:24,605 --> 01:06:27,149
And he's a little shy,

1319
01:06:27,233 --> 01:06:30,152
so it makes me super curious about him.

1320
01:06:30,236 --> 01:06:34,365
-So I want to get to know him better. -Because you don't know a lot about him.

1321
01:06:34,448 --> 01:06:36,534
I wanted to know what he was thinking, and--

1322
01:06:36,617 --> 01:06:39,453
I was just curious. I was most curious about him.

1323
01:06:39,537 --> 01:06:41,706
[whispering] Oh, so he made you curious?

1324
01:06:41,789 --> 01:06:44,250
-[whispering] He made me curious. -I see.

1325
01:06:44,333 --> 01:06:48,087
[in normal voice] And how was Pyeong-seok when you first started hanging out?

1326
01:06:48,170 --> 01:06:52,258
I asked questions. I asked questions like I was rubbing. [chuckles]

1327
01:06:52,341 --> 01:06:53,467
And he got shy.

1328
01:06:53,551 --> 01:06:56,345
But he interacted pretty well too, I guess.

1329
01:06:56,429 --> 01:06:58,514
At least he didn't ignore me or anything.

1330
01:06:58,597 --> 01:06:59,890
Hm.

1331
01:07:00,474 --> 01:07:02,101
What about you, Seo-yeong?

1332
01:07:03,352 --> 01:07:06,772
I… At first, I liked Ji-min.

1333
01:07:07,356 --> 01:07:11,277
But after talking with him, I realized, "Oh, he's just a friend."

1334
01:07:11,861 --> 01:07:12,778
Hm.

1335
01:07:13,404 --> 01:07:16,282
But there's somebody new that I want to get to know better.

1336
01:07:16,365 --> 01:07:18,409
-Who? -Sang-won.

1337
01:07:18,492 --> 01:07:19,368
Sang-won?

1338
01:07:19,452 --> 01:07:21,328
-Sang-won? -[Su-hyun] Sang-won?

1339
01:07:21,412 --> 01:07:24,040
Hm, I can see why.

1340
01:07:24,123 --> 01:07:28,544
-Sang-won is so nice when he talks. -Yeah, he's really nice when he talks.

1341
01:07:28,627 --> 01:07:31,839
He seems a lot more mature than the other guys.

1342
01:07:32,465 --> 01:07:35,801
Maybe because he went out into the world earlier.

1343
01:07:38,345 --> 01:07:42,725
I mean, it's not like we have to be attracted to somebody.

1344
01:07:43,225 --> 01:07:45,686
You should just try to have fun here.

1345
01:07:45,770 --> 01:07:48,773
Yeah. I want to know Sang-won better.

1346
01:07:51,358 --> 01:07:53,944
-[Se-yeon] Oh! -[Ji-min] It's time for a deep talk.

1347
01:07:54,028 --> 01:07:56,739
[upbeat whimsical music playing]

1348
01:08:04,497 --> 01:08:05,831
Yeah, it's time.

1349
01:08:05,915 --> 01:08:08,417
[laughing] Wow.

1350
01:08:08,501 --> 01:08:10,252
This is so fun to watch.

1351
01:08:10,336 --> 01:08:12,588
[Se-yeon] Right? For you…

1352
01:08:13,422 --> 01:08:14,924
What a headache.

1353
01:08:19,678 --> 01:08:22,264
I… need to go use the restroom.

1354
01:08:22,348 --> 01:08:23,390
The restroom.

1355
01:08:25,351 --> 01:08:26,185
Hm…

1356
01:08:26,852 --> 01:08:29,105
-What are you doing tomorrow? -Tomorrow?

1357
01:08:29,688 --> 01:08:31,982
I don't know. I don't have any plans yet.

1358
01:08:33,692 --> 01:08:35,236
What are you doing tomorrow?

1359
01:08:35,319 --> 01:08:37,738
-I think I'm going on a date. -With Ji-woo?

1360
01:08:38,405 --> 01:08:39,990
Yeah, he said that a while ago.

1361
01:08:44,703 --> 01:08:48,207
-[Ji-min] What are you doing tomorrow? -Me? I don't know yet.

1362
01:08:49,208 --> 01:08:52,002
You should try going on dates with the other girls.

1363
01:08:56,006 --> 01:08:58,551
[sighs] I'm actually going crazy right now though.

1364
01:08:59,260 --> 01:09:00,136
Are you tired?

1365
01:09:00,219 --> 01:09:03,222
Aside from being tired, things are so complicated.

1366
01:09:07,643 --> 01:09:10,271
-What? -[Ji-woo] Things are so complicated.

1367
01:09:10,354 --> 01:09:11,772
[Hee-ji] Come on up.

1368
01:09:11,856 --> 01:09:14,608
I see that we're going to talk about Jung-yun again.

1369
01:09:14,692 --> 01:09:16,777
[laughs]

1370
01:09:17,695 --> 01:09:20,823
-I have a question for you, Ji-woo. -[Ji-woo] Hm?

1371
01:09:20,906 --> 01:09:24,410
Jung-yun and Se-yeon both made their move at the same time.

1372
01:09:25,703 --> 01:09:27,454
-[Ji-woo] Honestly, I-- -Do you like him?

1373
01:09:27,538 --> 01:09:28,706
Se-yeon?

1374
01:09:28,789 --> 01:09:33,085
I don't know. When he said that, he seemed so charming.

1375
01:09:33,169 --> 01:09:35,629
I liked it, and I still like him.

1376
01:09:36,422 --> 01:09:38,299
But I don't really know for sure.

1377
01:09:38,382 --> 01:09:40,342
Even though he…

1378
01:09:40,426 --> 01:09:42,761
Even though he told me his honest feelings,

1379
01:09:43,762 --> 01:09:45,639
it just doesn't seem that way.

1380
01:09:45,723 --> 01:09:49,268
-[Hee-ji] Hm… He doesn't-- -He doesn't express those emotions.

1381
01:09:50,936 --> 01:09:55,649
So I keep thinking, "Does he actually like me?"

1382
01:09:56,233 --> 01:09:59,069
What's even more complicated for me is,

1383
01:09:59,153 --> 01:10:02,281
meanwhile, Jung-yun keeps hiding…

1384
01:10:02,907 --> 01:10:04,658
his true feelings from me.

1385
01:10:05,492 --> 01:10:08,787
I mean, it's super obvious that he's jealous, I guess.

1386
01:10:10,331 --> 01:10:12,249
He just keeps sighing.

1387
01:10:12,833 --> 01:10:14,168
So I ask him.

1388
01:10:15,711 --> 01:10:17,421
But he just won't talk.

1389
01:10:18,214 --> 01:10:21,008
I really want to hear how he feels like, I really…

1390
01:10:21,091 --> 01:10:23,010
That's natural.

1391
01:10:23,093 --> 01:10:25,763
"Ugh, does he actually like me? What is he thinking?"

1392
01:10:25,846 --> 01:10:27,473
-"How does he feel?" -Yeah.

1393
01:10:27,556 --> 01:10:31,727
Also, with Jung-yun, I like Jung-yun so much more

1394
01:10:31,810 --> 01:10:34,730
than Se-yeon or Ji-min right now.

1395
01:10:34,813 --> 01:10:38,817
So, if Jung-yun expresses his feelings even a little bit,

1396
01:10:39,443 --> 01:10:43,989
I think Jung-yun will keep being my number one.

1397
01:10:45,115 --> 01:10:47,243
But whenever I ask him about how he feels,

1398
01:10:47,326 --> 01:10:50,621
he avoids answering my questions, saying that he's embarrassed.

1399
01:10:52,498 --> 01:10:54,917
I heard Jung-yun talking about you.

1400
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:56,835
What? When?

1401
01:10:56,919 --> 01:10:59,129
He was like…

1402
01:11:01,298 --> 01:11:03,300
