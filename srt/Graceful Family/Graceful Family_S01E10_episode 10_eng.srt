6
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:22,120
 No matter who saw them, they didn't look like a couple who returned from their honeymoon. 

7
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:40,990
 Why aren't you washing up? 

8
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:43,840
 Oh, some work came up. 

9
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:49,420
 Are you... avoiding me? 

10
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:54,320
 You slept  throughout the honeymoon saying you were tired.  

11
00:01:57,070 --> 00:02:01,440
 Wan Joon, aren't we a married... 

12
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:20,360
 Also, I've been wondering about this earlier. 

13
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:23,760
 What's with that bed?  

14
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:28,890
 I have a habit of reading til late. I don't want to disturb you. 

15
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:32,050
 If someone is next to me, I can't sleep either. 

16
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:35,860
 Do you perhaps... have another woman? 

17
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:41,830
 Of course, that's possible. 

18
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:46,650
 But you should've have ended it before our marriage. 

19
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:14,390
 Although the wife waited desperately for the husband after that day, 

20
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:19,620
 the husband went even deeper into his own cave. 

21
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:23,700
 From the start, they couldn't be a married couple. 

22
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:29,730
 Graceful Family 
 Episode 10 

23
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:34,300
Didn't it bother your conscience while doing a background check? It didn't torment you?

24
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:37,580
If that's not it, you didn't tell me because you were perfectly fine about it?

25
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:40,970
If I had been in your position,

26
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:44,630
I would have acted a little differently.

27
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:47,080
I know, so listen to what I have to say.

28
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,360
We were almost there!

29
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:54,750
You ruined it all.

30
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:02,230
Ha Yeong Seo was starting to crack after losing her composure.

31
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:05,860
She was starting to crumble, unable to package it with hypocrisy!

32
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:07,460
But...

33
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:22,600
are we really on the same side?

34
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:32,190
Hey, Mo Seok Hui!

35
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:45,240
Mo Seok Hue, let's be honest with each other.

36
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:50,180
You made Ha Yeong Seo the suspect,

37
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:54,430
and now the most important thing for you is to get revenge on who killed your mom.

38
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:57,950
Let's say that's true, but what's wrong with that?

39
00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:00,870
You know how I lived after my mom was killed.

40
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:06,140
But my mom's killer is living too good of a life, shamelessly.

41
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:09,500
I'm going to make her so scared and anxious that,

42
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,900
she'd have a hard time breathing.

43
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,320
What's so wrong with that?

44
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,290
She is only a suspect.

45
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:17,590
There is no definite proof she is the murderer.

46
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:20,760
What's important is that we gather all the circumstantial evidence on the case

47
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,640
and file for a retrial.

48
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:27,110
Then not only the issue with my mom, but we can resolve on finding the real culprit, too.

49
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,220
To me revenge is first,

50
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:37,260
and your goal is to reveal that the incident was manipulated and get your mom out as soon as possible.

51
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:40,560
Right, it looks like our directions are different.

52
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,320
No, they're not different.

53
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,460
No, I think that they are different.

54
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:49,050
You don't care what's important to me. Whether my plan falls through or not.

55
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:50,250
That's not true.

56
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:54,460
Isn't it maybe that you don't want to find the real culprit?

57
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:58,150
Because all you need is an alibi to get your mom out.

58
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:32,830
 Why are you alone? 

59
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:41,880
 I, the person running beside you, do I not look like a person but an animal? 

60
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:06,510
- Is there a situation that I am not aware of?
 - There isn't.

61
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:09,970
Until yesterday she was leaping out of her skin saying she wanted to take over the household.

62
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:14,190
- She wants to suddenly leave the house? 
 - You know how impulsive she is.

63
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:17,710
If I were to assume, I think she

64
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:20,970
heard from somewhere that she's not compatible with this household. (superstition)

65
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:26,250
It'll be good, too, for the mother and son to live together.

66
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,970
That's true.

67
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:34,440
Wherever they go, let them live without any discomfort.

68
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,790
Please prepare well for them.

69
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:39,020
Do not worry.

70
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:02,940
You must be disappointed. Your Choi Na Ri tactic was pretty good.

71
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:07,200
Yes, it is far more refined than doing a digging up people's personal histories.

72
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:12,780
Do you still go to clubs often with Lawyer Heo?

73
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:15,910
He dances better than he looks, so I like him.

74
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,910
He wasn't able to do his job well concerning Choi Na Ri...

75
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:26,800
It makes me wonder if it wasn't because of his friendship with you...

76
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:11,420
I see Choi Na Ri is a proper femme fatale.

77
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:13,840
Chairman should never find out.

78
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,690
In the end, she gets eliminated like this.

79
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:19,430
Prepare her and Mo Seo Jin's green card as soon as possible.

80
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:21,500
Find a city for them to live where there aren't any Koreans.

81
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,330
Okay.

82
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:28,400
- Lawyer Heo's father must be very disappointed.
 - Yes.

83
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:31,400
It's a bit tough when you can't even deal with a basic task.

84
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,210
I apologize.

85
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:37,570
Team Leader Kwon, it looks like you'll have to teach him a lot.

86
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:42,270
- I understand. 
 - I have a lot to learn.

87
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:49,290
I'm not quick tempered but lack patience.

88
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:52,450
Managing your mental state is also an important part of your job.

89
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:54,520
The problem was not my mental state but my lack of ability.

90
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,510
From now on, I won't let things like this happen.

91
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:08,480
 He wasn't able to do his job well concerning Choi Na Ri... 

92
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,430
 It makes me wonder if it wasn't because of  

93
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:13,840
 his friendship with you... 

94
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:18,040
 I know, so listen to what I have to say. 

95
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:20,490
 We were almost there! 

96
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,600
 You ruined it all.  

97
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:01,280
 It's a style I like. 

98
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:04,920
 I wanted to have you try it on once. 

99
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:22,420
 It'd be nice to wear it when you go see your mother. It'll make your face lighter.  

100
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:31,470
 It's good to have a lot of ties. Let's wear some new styles, huh? 

101
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:40,200
Good bye!

102
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:48,570
Son, what brings you by at this hour?

103
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:50,490
I wanted to eat your food so I came by on purpose.

104
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:54,010
Oh, you didn't even eat lunch yet?

105
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:55,770
Wait a bit.

106
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:04,470
Why are you going around not even eating?

107
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:11,780
Father...

108
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:17,770
when you lost your family, how did you feel?

109
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:21,830
What are you saying out of the blue?

110
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:26,820
You know about the "Leader's Agony", right?

111
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:32,050
When they cut open the monkey's stomach that lost its young, the intestines were all cut.

112
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:36,960
It's like that.

113
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:41,150
I... lost my biological father when I was an infant,

114
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:44,250
so I didn't even have a chance to feel that kind of pain.

115
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:50,050
So whenever I thought about my mom in prison, I thought that was the biggest pain.

116
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:54,710
But at least you have hope that she can be released from jail.

117
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:59,060
There's no way to bring back someone who's passed away.

118
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,870
 You know how I lived after my mom was killed. 

119
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:08,170
 But the one who killed her is living so well, shamelessly. 

120
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:14,010
 I'm going to make her so scared and anxious and suffocated so that she trembles in fear. 

121
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:18,170
- Mr. Heo Yoon Do? 
 - Yes.

122
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:21,700
    

123
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,240
Seriously.

124
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:39,230
 It's not me throwing around money. 

125
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:42,720
 This is just... my heart. 

126
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:22,200
I'm sure he got it.

127
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:32,070
Miss, there's a delivery for you.

128
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:34,840
Delivery?

129
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:44,440
 One Team Mo Seok Hui. 

130
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:48,810
 In order to really be on the same team, we need to know each other better, no? 

131
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:50,980
 So I'm sending you my daily life. 

132
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:55,350
 By the way, this is not me being cheesy, it's my heart. 

133
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:06,080
 I used to wash everything from my hair to my toes with just one soap. 

134
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,700
 Since it's fast and comfortable. 

135
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:10,820
 But I started using shampoo these days. 

136
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:14,540
 Why you ask? Because you might tell me off saying I smell weird. 

137
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:17,240
 How is this scent? Is it okay? 

138
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:30,960
 It's a snack I like the most. When you eat sweet red bean jelly, it puts you in a good mood, 

139
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:34,140
 and the sausage I ate when I worked part-time gave me energy. 

140
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:36,600
 Try it once./i&gt; 

141
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:47,290
 When everyone ate cereal, I put this inexpensive snack in milk and ate it instead.  

142
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:51,270
 There's a sweet taste that's different from high-end cereals. 

143
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:57,230
 Since you have auto-brewery syndrome, try it in milk when you feel like drinking. 

144
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:03,750
 When you dislike someone, chew this!  

145
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:17,280
 This is a secret, but reading the law books always put me to sleep. 

146
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,340
 I don't use it as a sleeping pill anymore, 

147
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:24,780
 but it could work for you, too, so try using it when you can't fall asleep. 

148
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:32,180
 Truce? OK!   

149
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:36,600
Okay.

150
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:57,530
 Shampoo isn't to my taste, but it's not bad.  

151
00:17:57,530 --> 00:17:59,940
 And the sausage tastes good, too. 

152
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,610
Oh.

153
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:17,500
Channel Islands. A seaside community where many wealthy older white couples live. What do you think?

154
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:21,360
It's close to LA, too, so it's also easy to apply for.

155
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,690
It's not bad.

156
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:28,080
  Madame Ha Yeong Seo  

157
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:30,190
Yes, Madame.

158
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:33,560
 Director Han, connect me to video call. 

159
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:36,830
Just a second. Connect her.

160
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:44,280
 You're discussing about where to send Choi Na Ri, right? 

161
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:47,580
 I think that Laos... 

162
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:49,750
 Laos would be good. 

163
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:52,030
 A country where meditation and silence is beautiful. 

164
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:55,820
 Wouldn't it be best place to self-reflect and spend time doing some self-examination? 

165
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:59,130
 On top of that, the cost of living is cheap, so she can save money. 

166
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:00,690
 How nice is it? 

167
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:04,520
- Education for Seo Jin is a bit... 
  - What are you talking about? 

168
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:07,350
 For kids, being with their mom is heaven for them. 

169
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:10,090
 To some, it might be a country of rest, 

170
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:14,620
 but to that wench who was always chasing after good-time, it's perfect. 

171
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:19,320
 It's not a reward vacation, so shouldn't she deal with at least that much inconveniences? 

172
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,180
 Director Han, 

173
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:25,330
 this is not a request. Got it? 

174
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:34,470
We'll have to change Choi Na Ri's final destination to Laos.

175
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:38,470
- Lawyer Heo, you are in charge of seeing Choi Na Ri and Mo Seo Jin off. 
 - Got it.

176
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:42,700
What do we do, now that the ace up Miss Mo Seok Hui's sleeve has disappeared?

177
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,830
Do you still meet up often with Miss these days?

178
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:48,990
Yes, well, we go to the club often together to get rid of stress.

179
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:50,970
That's nice.

180
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:56,280
But Lawyer Heo, you are keeping business and personal lives separate well, right?

181
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,700
Yes. Of course.

182
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:44,370
When you get there, Southeast Asia branch's employees will help you out.

183
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:46,900
Will you be okay to live in Laos?

184
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:50,040
Rather than being beaten to death here by your father,

185
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:53,980
it's better to die of heat in Laos.

186
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,960
Noona, I like Laos.

187
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,620
I'm gonna play with mom every day instead of going to the academy.

188
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:05,750
Yes, spend as much time as possible with your mom.

189
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:09,500
Yay! Let's go to Laos!

190
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:15,430
Do you know something?

191
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:19,500
A badger, while killing and eating a poisonous snake

192
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:23,700
ends up fainting because of the poison.

193
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:27,740
But when it wakes up after passing out for a few hours,

194
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:31,370
it finishes eating up that poisonous snake.

195
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:33,660
Isn't it amazing?

196
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:41,740
I... am going to be that badger from now on.

197
00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:44,420
Who knows?

198
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:49,190
I might become the best actress in Laos, too.

199
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:54,700
Seo Jin...

200
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:56,860
Mo Seo Jin.

201
00:21:56,860 --> 00:22:00,070
Should we fill up on tons of Korean food before we leave?

202
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:02,360
Wow! I'd love to! I want meat!

203
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:04,660
Me too.

204
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:08,940
Lawyer Heo, do you know a good place for meat?

205
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:10,670
Of course.

206
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:22,270
   Closed Today    
 It looks delicious.

207
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,450
Here.

208
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:29,180
I lived as your fan all my life while longing.

209
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:32,460
A day like this does come, indeed.

210
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:35,690
This fullness of my heart,

211
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:39,090
the heavens would know. Eat a lot

212
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:40,470
and cheer up!

213
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:42,520
Thank you.

214
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:44,020
Fine, fine.

215
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:46,630
- Please have some, too. 
 - No, I'm-- 
 - Open up.

216
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,430
Son, thank you so much.

217
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:59,930
Even if I died tomorrow, I won't be sad. You're the best.

218
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:03,000
Father... please pull yourself together.

219
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,920
I got it.

220
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,900
- Do I look okay? 
 - Yeah.

221
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:13,710
Can we ask for a photo?

222
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:21,730
Just one, okay?

223
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:25,460
Sorry, but he would like a picture...

224
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:26,860
Oh, okay.

225
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:28,730
Thank you.

226
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:34,720
Look here. One, two, three.

227
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:39,370
- Thank you. 
 - Sure.

228
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,470
What about the two of you take a picture, too?

229
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:44,670
It's fine.

230
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:47,210
Come on! Let's take one!

231
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:50,480
- No. 
 - Come on!

232
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:55,340
What's wrong with your expressions? Like you're born in '88.

233
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:57,730
Like this!

234
00:23:57,730 --> 00:24:01,770
Put your hand up like this.

235
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:03,410
That's it. Now...

236
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:07,060
One, two, three.

237
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:12,110
- You got it? 
 - Yeah.

238
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:29,190
Is Baek Soo Jin TOP's next target?

239
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:35,050
Over what issue will she get kicked out after being stripped down bare?

240
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:38,310
I assured her that she could get a lot as settlement.

241
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:41,430
I'm losing face completely.

242
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:44,100
You're giving me a loaded question, right?

243
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:47,040
I'm not. Is that how it comes across?

244
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,510
Yeah.

245
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:53,200
I can't interfere with your job at TOP.

246
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,600
Don't get bothered too much.

247
00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:02,890
What is it?

248
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:08,670
- Baek Soo Jin is having an affair with a chef. 
 - What?

249
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:11,020
TOP planned out her affair.

250
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:13,980
And that's a video of TOP's meeting.

251
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:17,730
You might not have a use for it right away,

252
00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:21,600
but find some other way to help her.

253
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:26,090
You make me feel really ashamed.

254
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:28,580
You don't need be so touched.

255
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:32,860
Since keeping a record of TOP's every move is also one of my missions.

256
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:35,940
You're the real spy it seems like.

257
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:37,740
I'm desperate, that's why.

258
00:25:40,810 --> 00:25:43,460
Of course, you probably feel no different.

259
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,940
Vice President is entering.

260
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:22,730
Congratulations on being promoted to Vice President.

261
00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:25,680
Director Han, you worked hard.

262
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:30,540
She's the one who did all the work for his promotion.

263
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:35,170
I hope you will keep going  up and up while putting your trust in Director Han.

264
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,000
Today's first item.

265
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,200
Let's hear your additional opinions of investing in MC Technology.

266
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:13,380
Yum! C'est bon! ( It's great!) 

267
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:16,150
Today's vegetables are especially fresh!

268
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:18,530
Have a lot.

269
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:24,370
Seo Jin and his mom disappeared, but I guess you all feel relieved, don't you?

270
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:27,990
Our household isn't fit for just anyone.

271
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:30,300
In a household that values manners and moderation,

272
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:34,400
Seo Jin's mom seems to have had a hard time adjusting.

273
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:39,400
Letting the mother and son live comfortably is also our duty.

274
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:44,000
So, that's why you sent someone who is heat-sensitive to Laos?

275
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,110
Because it's your duty?

276
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,490
She wanted it.

277
00:27:51,490 --> 00:27:55,380
Saying she wanted to raise Seo-Jin in an eco-friendly way.

278
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,790
How was the meeting?

279
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:04,660
There were a few bat-like board members who got on my nerves.

280
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:08,020
I'm making up a list to see if I should take care of them. I'll submit a report.

281
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:10,830
If the water is too clear, fish can't live.

282
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:12,840
If you get rid of all the bats, bad times will come.

283
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:16,210
It's more important to think about how to utilize the bats!

284
00:28:16,210 --> 00:28:18,090
I understand.

285
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:23,870
That's right. Don't you know that in China, bats are a symbol of happiness.

286
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:27,120
That's why on furniture and clothes, there's a lot of bat patterns.

287
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,560
On top of that, it's a symbol of long life.

288
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,700
Like father says, get rid of prejudice.

289
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:36,560
Prejudice is actually a relic of an old generation.

290
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,580
Don't you think, Father?

291
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:41,870
- Are you done with the movie yet? 
 - Pardon?

292
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:47,940
No. The shoot is over, but I still have post-production work left to do.

293
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:51,730
- Are you going to finish it this time? 
 - Of course.

294
00:28:56,690 --> 00:29:01,390
It's nice to have just our family dining together.

295
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:06,300
I guess Seo Jin... isn't father's son?

296
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,150
I'm sorry!

297
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,420
It's okay.

298
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:22,290
- I'll get going first. 
 - You should finish eating.

299
00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:23,820
You can change after.

300
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:26,300
No. I'm done.

301
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:32,440
In any case, he's so meticulous.

302
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,540
C'est bon!

303
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:48,880
Is this a rest stop?

304
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:58,310
I'm letting it slide since it's you.

305
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,750
- I heard you saw Seo Jin off.
 - Yeah.

306
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:08,940
- By chance, did you hear everything about me from Lawyer Heo? 
 - Yeah.

307
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:13,090
So, what are you going to do?

308
00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:15,560
- You think I'll tell on you? 
 - Come on.

309
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:20,780
That's not your style!

310
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:26,360
Anyway, my 30% has turned into bubbles.

311
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:31,710
But why do our parents only bet on Wan Joon instead of me, the eldest?

312
00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:34,510
Hey, who would you bet on if it was up to you?

313
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:37,380
- I would bet on you. 
 - Really? 
 - Yeah.

314
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,100
Why?

315
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:45,170
Do you remember? 15 years ago.

316
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:48,740
The day my mom was murdered...

317
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:52,510
I came to this house.

318
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:55,350
 Hey, give me that blanket. 

319
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:57,000
 Hand it over. 

320
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,730
 So annoying! 

321
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:04,620
 Seok Hui, that blanket was at the murder site!  

322
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:08,260
 You can't bring in unlucky things into this household, so hurry up and hand it over. 

323
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:11,890
 I don't want to. It's my mom's blanket. 

324
00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:13,410
 This wench, so stubborn. 

325
00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:18,640
 Hey, I... can't stand anything that's filthy. 

326
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:21,870
 Won't you give it to me? I'll take it from you then. 

327
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:25,100
 Give me. Give it.  

328
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:28,920
 - I don't want to! 
 - Give it to me! 

329
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:31,030
 - I said I don't want to! 
 - Give it!  

330
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:33,800
 What are you doing to a kid? 

331
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:58,600
 At that time, you were the only one. 

332
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:02,550
You giving me a hug that day...

333
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:07,860
I wouldn't ever compare you to Mo Wan Joon.

334
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:16,570
I don't think there's anything you can't do that he's doing.

335
00:32:25,530 --> 00:32:29,160
This kid has more beautiful emotions than she looks.

336
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:35,170
I'm going.

337
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,950
Choi Na Ri and Seo Jin arrived in Laos well.

338
00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:56,520
Thanks to Team Leader Kwon, Choi Na Ri issue was easily resolved.

339
00:32:56,520 --> 00:33:01,160
Well, thanks to that, it's a relief that Madame Ha Yeong Seo's stress has been reduced.

340
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:04,480
Team Leader Kwon, why should you be worrying about Madame's stress levels?

341
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,440
Don't go overboard!

342
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:11,620
Also, since when did TOP self-praise over something like this?

343
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:15,410
We're loyal to MC Group, not the family.

344
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:19,630
There's no exceptions to that prerequisite for any member of the family. Got it?!

345
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:25,510
- What about Baek Soo Jin? 
 - Yes.

346
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:27,510
It's going well according to plan.

347
00:33:32,170 --> 00:33:36,530
We could say they've gone as far as they can seeing this, no?

348
00:33:36,530 --> 00:33:37,930
We can say that.

349
00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:40,170
If she becomes a married woman who's liable,

350
00:33:40,170 --> 00:33:43,680
we have complete advantage during the settlement negotiation.

351
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:47,620
How much is going into her family right now?

352
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:51,130
This is the detailed information on their card spending and the overseas education cost for her younger sibling.

353
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:55,430
If you think about it in terms of a set amount of money being given year after year for decades,

354
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:58,530
it would be beneficial to cut her out while we have something on her.

355
00:33:58,530 --> 00:34:02,060
In the end, the calculator decides our fate, I guess.

356
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:04,730
It's the conclusion to the loveless couple.

357
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:06,900
Her family is not an easy mark.

358
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:09,510
Don't be lax just because we found grounds for liability.

359
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:13,220
Figure out even their relatives' tendencies and prepare for a possible lawsuit, too.

360
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:17,730
They've already consulted their lawyer, and we took care of it.

361
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:19,670
I'm glad you're quick.

362
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:23,540
But, what's the Achilles heel of the guy she's seeing?

363
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:26,170
It's a bit of a fatal mistake.

364
00:34:26,170 --> 00:34:28,810
 The Gangnam restaurant you own, 

365
00:34:28,810 --> 00:34:32,320
 - there were a lot of customers. 
 - Yes.  

366
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,800
 Chef Kim, you came out of ALMA, right? 

367
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:38,230
That's a difficult school to get accepted to.

368
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:42,270
You were working as an assistant in Saudi Arabia after you graduated.

369
00:34:42,270 --> 00:34:44,550
Your resume didn't match up, so we looked at the list of graduates and--

370
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:46,030
Wait!

371
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:53,520
I mean, why are you doing this to me?

372
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:57,300
Korean people really dislike those that lie about their education.

373
00:34:58,130 --> 00:35:00,170
Why did you do that?

374
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:28,330
Fine! There's no need to waste our resources by prolonging something that will be over anyway.

375
00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:29,780
Let's strike as soon as possible!

376
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:31,580
We understand.

377
00:35:40,690 --> 00:35:43,510
This is Miss Mo Seok Hui.

378
00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:45,930
Hello.

379
00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:49,890
She's Young Gallery's curator as well as its manager.

380
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:51,480
I see.

381
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:56,410
In your eyes, Curator,

382
00:35:56,410 --> 00:35:59,840
how is the art gallery management skills of Manager Ha Yeong Seo?

383
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:02,010
It's perfect.

384
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:13,680
You don't waste even a second. What brings you here all of a sudden?

385
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:16,280
No matter how busy I am, I have to deliver a present.

386
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:18,110
Present?

387
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:20,800
- Then by chance... 
 - Yes.

388
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:24,880
We got a call from US asking us to do an exhibition of YS' work.

389
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:28,450
Of really? That's so great!

390
00:36:28,450 --> 00:36:31,360
All this time, working timidly as YS,

391
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,270
it was hard on you emotionally, right?

392
00:36:33,270 --> 00:36:35,900
It's been 15 years since Artist Ahn passed away.

393
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:38,920
Let's reveal your identity proudly.

394
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,650
We have enough paintings, right?

395
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:43,090
Artist Ahn was a perfectionist,

396
00:36:43,090 --> 00:36:46,530
so most of the art work wasn't presented even after they were completed.

397
00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:49,520
Don't worry. No one will recognize them.

398
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:52,540
I got it. I'll trust you!

399
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:54,120
Of course.

400
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:57,130
But... I just met her.

401
00:36:57,130 --> 00:37:00,020
Is Mo Seok Hui that Artist Ahn's daughter?

402
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:02,120
That's right.

403
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:05,570
I don't go to the gallery a lot since she arrived from the States.

404
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:07,450
On purpose.

405
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:10,920
It's good to be careful.

406
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:44,840
You'll definitely give a commission and sponsorship for the gallery, right?

407
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:47,080
Of course.

408
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:50,140
Little Madame is entering.

409
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:55,090
- Are you going out? 
 - Yes, Mother-in-law.

410
00:37:55,090 --> 00:37:59,630
I have a concert to attend after the cooking lesson, so I'll be a little late.

411
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:03,290
Really? Have a nice time.

412
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:13,110
Your daughter-in-law is very elegant.

413
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:17,210
She's from a noble family, so, of course, she's on another level.

414
00:38:29,690 --> 00:38:31,910
Director Han wants to see you.

415
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:33,460
Me?

416
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:36,550
Why? I have an appointment.

417
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:39,680
It would be best to postpone it.

418
00:38:55,530 --> 00:38:56,980
Sit down.

419
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:14,150
What is it?

420
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:16,720
Do you like Vivaldi?

421
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:19,020
Yes. Well...

422
00:39:20,350 --> 00:39:23,120
That person had an affair with his student in his later years

423
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:26,630
and has a funny history of running away to Austria.

424
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:31,160
But the cello pieces all sound alike, so I'm not crazy about them.

425
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:33,540
He likes reproducing his own work, I guess.

426
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:37,980
It's a specific thing about Baroque music as well.

427
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:40,370
But what's the reason you wanted to see me?

428
00:39:40,370 --> 00:39:43,620
Your husband became the de facto successor.

429
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:46,450
What will you do about divorce?

430
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:51,200
I'm planning on getting a divorce.

431
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:58,620
How much do you want?

432
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:03,260
I should get... about 10% of his asset.

433
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:05,780
Are you serious?

434
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:07,400
It's over 100 billion won.

435
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:11,220
Don't you think I have a right to it?

436
00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:15,190
So that's what you're thinking...

437
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:18,890
I told you my thoughts, so I'll get going.

438
00:40:18,890 --> 00:40:21,230
I have an appointment.

439
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:25,230
Where will you go when you get a divorce?

440
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:29,130
Not sure.

441
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:43,290
Check the Chairman and Vice-President Mo Wan Joon's schedule for today.

442
00:40:43,290 --> 00:40:45,300
Yes.

443
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:48,620
Find Baek Soo Jin and make sure she comes home by 7:00.

444
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:49,700
Yes.

445
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:52,280
Have you looked into Baek Soo Jin's relatives?

446
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:55,400
Having analyzed all the close acquaintances in law as well as those who work for the school, defense is absolutely possible.

447
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:58,790
Also, you don't have to worry since we've again made the lawyers for the family immobile.

448
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:01,540
Good. Print out Baek Soo Jin's Divorce Agreement.

449
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:03,000
Yes.

450
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:07,010
- Make sure Madame Ha Yeong Seo comes home on time, too. 
 - Yes.

451
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:11,660
Let's finish off this loveless couple today.

452
00:41:15,850 --> 00:41:18,620
Chairman is on his way home, and Vice-President Mo is having a meeting

453
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:22,170
with Arab investors but will be home by 7:00.

454
00:41:22,170 --> 00:41:26,030
Madame just arrived home and has no other appointment.

455
00:41:26,030 --> 00:41:28,700
Madame Baek Soo Jin has been contacted as well.

456
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:32,380
The Divorce Agreement.

457
00:41:33,450 --> 00:41:36,070
- Let's print out another version as well. 
 - Pardon?

458
00:41:36,070 --> 00:41:37,810
Oh, yes.

459
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:47,690
You...

460
00:41:48,190 --> 00:41:50,650
as MC Group's obedient spouse,

461
00:41:50,650 --> 00:41:53,010
you weren't able to carry out your duties.

462
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:57,320
You asked for 10% of Wan Joon's asset as settlement?

463
00:41:57,320 --> 00:42:00,790
We gave millions to your family since you got married!

464
00:42:00,790 --> 00:42:05,240
This is not a problem of money but trust.

465
00:42:05,850 --> 00:42:09,380
Fa- father, mother, I don't understand what you're saying.

466
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:14,970
I hear that the Italian meal you proudly made every weekend is the result of your affair.

467
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:31,260
We have testimony from the person involved in the affair as well.

468
00:42:47,850 --> 00:42:50,150
It's shame to the family name.

469
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:55,930
So the refinement you speak of is going to hotel rooms with another man?

470
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:03,860
Since the day we got married until now,

471
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,150
we have...

472
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:08,750
not been a married couple.

473
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:15,430
The duty of an obedient wife?

474
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:18,630
What about the duty of the husband?

475
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:22,810
Do you think I didn't have a child bearing the Mo family name because I didn't want to?

476
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:28,230
Mo Wan Joon.

477
00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:32,160
You are not qualified to be a husband.

478
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:34,750
It's been sixth year of marriage,

479
00:43:35,690 --> 00:43:38,160
but we have never even had a wedding night.

480
00:43:44,370 --> 00:43:48,980
In front of elders, what are these ill-manners?

481
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:52,030
How lacking you must have been.

482
00:43:54,390 --> 00:43:57,280
Shame to the family name?

483
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:02,690
Your family is so great that the house is filled with children with different mothers I see!

484
00:44:02,690 --> 00:44:04,190
Divorce?

485
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:06,320
I am going to do it.

486
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:08,600
You're the brazen type who would

487
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:11,270
just chew gum after killing someone.

488
00:44:11,270 --> 00:44:14,020
Who said you could get a divorce as you wish?!

489
00:44:15,370 --> 00:44:17,630
I did, of course.

490
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:23,560
You have two options.

491
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:32,600
First, sign the agreement quietly and leave the house.

492
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:35,440
But there won't be any alimony.

493
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:40,440
Second, you'll live your whole life without a divorce but you can't go out.

494
00:44:41,530 --> 00:44:44,000
Choose one.

495
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:55,430
You people are really...

496
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,450
too much...

497
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:05,220
When the husband didn't fulfill his duty,

498
00:45:05,770 --> 00:45:09,160
asking only sister-in-law to take the responsibility

499
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:10,730
is a bit shameless, don't you think?

500
00:45:10,730 --> 00:45:14,110
But not everyone has an affair because of it.

501
00:45:15,910 --> 00:45:18,720
Isn't having affairs the tradition of this family?

502
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:22,400
Grandfather, father, brothers...

503
00:45:23,370 --> 00:45:25,140
Stepmother...

504
00:45:25,730 --> 00:45:27,930
Can you be confident about not having had an affair?

505
00:45:27,930 --> 00:45:29,970
What are you talking about right now?

506
00:45:29,970 --> 00:45:33,490
It's not a place for you to butt in! Get out immediately.

507
00:45:33,490 --> 00:45:37,530
Whether they just lived together as a formality, they lived together for six years.

508
00:45:37,530 --> 00:45:40,800
But this is the best you can do to treat a human being?

509
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:44,590
At least, you're the husband.

510
00:45:44,590 --> 00:45:47,790
Feel betrayed? I'm sure you do.

511
00:45:47,790 --> 00:45:52,690
But feeling betrayed is only possible when you have given something to the other person.

512
00:45:53,390 --> 00:45:56,000
What have you given her?

513
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,790
Do you even had the right to feel betrayed?

514
00:45:58,790 --> 00:46:03,010
If you have no sense of shame, the least you should have are manners.

515
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:06,780
If my sister-in-law gets insulted, it's the same as if you were insulted as well.

516
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:09,560
That's empathic ability!

517
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:13,530
Even if you lived six years with a cockroach, wouldn't you develop some emotion?

518
00:46:13,530 --> 00:46:18,100
Whether that's love and hatred, sympathy, whether you love or not!

519
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:22,990
But you were only capable of this much?

520
00:46:22,990 --> 00:46:24,360
I mean...

521
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:27,270
are you even a human being?

522
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:44,660
Seok Hui...

523
00:46:45,750 --> 00:46:48,900
it's because your mental state is that way

524
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:52,860
that you're living penniless in this house like a parasite!

525
00:46:57,690 --> 00:46:59,430
Mo Wan Joon.

526
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:06,500
But at least I'm a human being.

527
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:09,000
But you?

528
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,260
Your blood is blue, isn't it?

529
00:47:27,260 --> 00:47:29,770
You have a fighter tendency.

530
00:47:29,770 --> 00:47:32,040
I'm sure the sister-in-law was touched.

531
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:36,860
But Miss, what can you do for her?

532
00:47:36,860 --> 00:47:40,880
Comforting her with only words is nothing.

533
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:43,280
I thought that even if our values were different

534
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:45,980
you would be at least special.

535
00:47:47,350 --> 00:47:50,370
But you're really unattractive.

536
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:54,640
You were just a stiff gestapo.

537
00:48:03,770 --> 00:48:06,160
Wan Joon's wife

538
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:08,670
doesn't deserve a choice.

539
00:48:09,610 --> 00:48:12,070
Throw her out right away.

540
00:48:12,070 --> 00:48:13,770
I understand.

541
00:48:36,050 --> 00:48:39,020
It's not the money that's the issue.

542
00:48:39,550 --> 00:48:41,470
This household...

543
00:48:41,470 --> 00:48:43,760
I'm so sick of it.

544
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:46,310
What are you thinking about doing now?

545
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:49,300
I have to leave.

546
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:52,580
I don't want to explain everything pathetically either.

547
00:48:52,580 --> 00:48:54,910
It won't even get through to them anyway.

548
00:48:54,910 --> 00:48:57,490
Dirty mud fight...

549
00:48:58,190 --> 00:49:00,260
I don't want to do it.

550
00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:03,130
Are you going to leave without a penny?

551
00:49:03,130 --> 00:49:07,010
It'll be uncomfortable and you'll become poor.

552
00:49:08,010 --> 00:49:10,290
Who cares if I'm poor?

553
00:49:10,290 --> 00:49:15,150
I want to live happy and free even for a moment.

554
00:49:15,150 --> 00:49:16,620
That man...

555
00:49:17,270 --> 00:49:19,060
do you love him?

556
00:49:21,740 --> 00:49:23,640
I think I laughed

557
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:27,390
for the first time in six years because of him.

558
00:49:27,850 --> 00:49:30,670
I am someone who can laugh, too...

559
00:49:31,470 --> 00:49:34,090
I realized for the first time.

560
00:49:36,270 --> 00:49:38,940
But I have to end it.

561
00:49:39,570 --> 00:49:42,180
I was too unaware of this family.

562
00:49:42,810 --> 00:49:44,400
By the way,

563
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:48,250
asking for 10% of your brother's asset... it's money I know,

564
00:49:48,250 --> 00:49:52,910
but it's because I wanted to at least be comforted for my miserable married life.

565
00:49:55,950 --> 00:50:03,690
But in this house, no matter what it is, it's impossible.

566
00:50:08,070 --> 00:50:10,280
Thank you.

567
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:20,350
I  won't accept your thanks because I couldn't give you any real help.

568
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:24,980
But, do you still want to believe in love?

569
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:28,090
I believe in love itself.

570
00:50:28,090 --> 00:50:32,650
But first I intend to believe in myself.

571
00:50:33,930 --> 00:50:37,880
Don't you believe in love?

572
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:43,520
Love and stuff like that which blinds you and makes you lose your mind.

573
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:45,220
It is  emotion which I don't need.

574
00:50:45,220 --> 00:50:52,100
Nevertheless, I hope for you  someday that you will love.

575
00:51:07,170 --> 00:51:08,840
It's a necklace.

576
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:11,180
I'm asking for a favor.

577
00:51:12,130 --> 00:51:15,280
Please take care of this.

578
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:19,090
And don't ever cut off contact with me.

579
00:51:19,090 --> 00:51:23,200
If I call, please answer.

580
00:51:23,950 --> 00:51:26,350
I promise.

581
00:51:26,350 --> 00:51:33,480
Thanks to you, I have one good memory of this household.

582
00:51:39,250 --> 00:51:44,730
Did you ever date a man before going out with Oppa Wan Joon?

583
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:47,860
About that ... why ...?

584
00:51:47,860 --> 00:51:53,330
I'm sorry to upset you.  You look different.

585
00:51:55,940 --> 00:51:57,480
You saw correctly.

586
00:51:57,480 --> 00:52:02,150
Wan Joon was my first man.

587
00:52:02,150 --> 00:52:06,760
Then, maybe, are you still physically a virgin?

588
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:14,890
Does Oppa have a woman?

589
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:31,590
Once, I thought he disliked woman.   I had my doubts about him.

590
00:52:31,590 --> 00:52:37,630
So I had him secretly  followed  and I found there was a woman.

591
00:52:37,630 --> 00:52:39,550
Is that so?

592
00:52:52,470 --> 00:52:54,390
It's delicious.

593
00:53:03,490 --> 00:53:07,370
But are you and my Yoon Do dating each other recently?

594
00:53:07,370 --> 00:53:09,030
Why does you keep popping in and out?

595
00:53:09,030 --> 00:53:13,050
Is that meant to be funny?  Please try something newer.

596
00:53:13,050 --> 00:53:16,120
I still tend to tell dad jokes.

597
00:53:18,380 --> 00:53:20,560
But did something happen to you?

598
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:23,830
Why is your expression like a mother-in-law who wasn't fed her dinner?

599
00:53:23,830 --> 00:53:27,050
There's nothing going on.

600
00:53:27,050 --> 00:53:32,110
Money is something.   It's really not a joke that money is scarier than people.

601
00:53:32,110 --> 00:53:32,910
I'll say.

602
00:53:32,910 --> 00:53:34,890
Why?  What is it?

603
00:53:34,890 --> 00:53:40,080
There are men who hire someone to seduce their wives so they won't have to pay alimony.

604
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:43,780
What, my gosh.

605
00:53:43,780 --> 00:53:45,600
Then when they go to hell,

606
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:50,300
they should chew and eat money three times a day.

607
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:54,390
It would be great if they are loaded because their stomachs will be stuffed.

608
00:53:55,390 --> 00:53:58,380
Dad, why are you getting so riled up?

609
00:53:58,380 --> 00:54:00,930
Do you think I don't know? All because of money our Na RI

610
00:54:00,930 --> 00:54:05,690
couldn't do acting and got kicked out of the country.

611
00:54:07,030 --> 00:54:13,050
Anyhow, we don't even know how Na Ri is doing.

612
00:54:13,050 --> 00:54:17,560
How can she live in a strange and unfamiliar country?

613
00:54:18,430 --> 00:54:23,590
Has she been bitten by a snake or are  there  swarms off mosquitoes?

614
00:54:23,590 --> 00:54:25,960
My heart is torn up.

615
00:54:26,810 --> 00:54:31,380
What is money? People are more important than money.

616
00:54:31,380 --> 00:54:34,450
Money is not more important than people.

617
00:54:52,380 --> 00:54:59,390
I was bored and miserable all the time I lived with you.

618
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:07,430
Although you might not think so, there's no need to pity me.

619
00:55:07,430 --> 00:55:10,450
I'm happy now.

620
00:55:10,450 --> 00:55:13,290
You made a wise decision.

621
00:55:13,290 --> 00:55:16,450
Out of the people here,, you were the only one who didn't fit in.

622
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:21,170
I can't wish a good life to you.

623
00:55:21,170 --> 00:55:25,750
Anyway, you can't do this in this terrible house.

624
00:55:27,470 --> 00:55:31,180
For the last time may I ask one question?

625
00:55:31,180 --> 00:55:37,130
Was I really that unattractive as a woman?

626
00:55:37,130 --> 00:55:40,810
Or ... was there some other reason?

627
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:45,730
Now that I am beyond your control,

628
00:55:45,730 --> 00:55:48,650
is that idle curiosity?

629
00:55:51,230 --> 00:55:59,050
Anyway, I didn't stay in this house just for the money.

630
00:55:59,050 --> 00:56:01,310
You know that as well.

631
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:52,630
In the end Sister-in-law is leaving.

632
00:56:52,630 --> 00:56:57,500
Your masterpiece Wan Joon finally has a flaw as a divorcé.

633
00:56:57,500 --> 00:57:01,520
So, does that make you feel good?

634
00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:06,290
Here's what the French writer Voltaire said.

635
00:57:06,290 --> 00:57:11,900
The Holy Roman Empire was neither holy, nor Roman,

636
00:57:11,900 --> 00:57:15,310
nor even an empire.

637
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:25,190
Are you now trying to tell me that Wan Joon is not a masterpiece?

638
00:57:25,190 --> 00:57:28,330
Even a masterpiece is cursed ...

639
00:57:28,330 --> 00:57:32,840
Well, I want to say something to that effect.

640
00:57:37,420 --> 00:57:42,440
Mom, how much do you know about him?

641
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:51,890
I don't think how well you know him is proportional to how well you love him.

642
00:57:51,890 --> 00:57:54,020
What does that mean?

643
00:57:54,790 --> 00:58:01,580
Maybe no matter what he is  doing, I am wondering if there might be something else he really wants to do.

644
00:58:01,580 --> 00:58:07,150
So, are you going to make a pass for the company now?

645
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:13,390
If you give free rein to an unreasonable greed, I won't let it slide.

646
00:59:15,390 --> 00:59:17,330
Get in.

647
00:59:23,990 --> 00:59:25,980
I didn't need a ride.

648
00:59:25,980 --> 00:59:28,340
I can't let you leave like this.

649
00:59:28,340 --> 00:59:29,330
What?

650
00:59:29,330 --> 00:59:31,850
I know you're  dignified and a loner.

651
00:59:31,850 --> 00:59:35,180
But that dignity won't feed you.

652
00:59:35,180 --> 00:59:39,410
More importantly, that dignity is only useful with people who recognize it.

653
00:59:39,410 --> 00:59:43,270
What on earth does that mean?

654
00:59:43,270 --> 00:59:48,530
It's justice to treat cheap people cheaply.

655
01:00:03,860 --> 01:00:06,620
Madame Baek Soo Jin came.

656
01:00:11,990 --> 01:00:16,600
As this is the last time, please give me a cup of tea.

657
01:00:26,190 --> 01:00:31,930
The leader of TOP is Director Han, a woman. If you include Gyeong Ah and Ju Yeong,

658
01:00:31,930 --> 01:00:34,430
half of the employees here are female.

659
01:00:34,430 --> 01:00:39,660
TOP is not an organization which discriminates against woman.

660
01:00:39,660 --> 01:00:42,100
Are you going to your parents' home in Yongin?

661
01:00:42,100 --> 01:00:47,090
No.   I still haven't decided where I'm going.

662
01:00:47,090 --> 01:00:53,840
My parents have lived their lives as upright civil servants so they have made no provision for their retirement.

663
01:00:53,840 --> 01:01:00,370
My younger sister too will have to return to Korea now if TOP cuts off her support.

664
01:01:00,370 --> 01:01:02,300
It's a shame.

665
01:01:02,300 --> 01:01:06,080
Unlike me, she has ability.

666
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:09,530
Help her graduate.

667
01:01:09,530 --> 01:01:12,590
We finished talking about alimony.

668
01:01:21,160 --> 01:01:23,510
You know I'm in my sixth year of marriage, don't you?

669
01:01:23,510 --> 01:01:28,430
This is the result of a gynecologist's physical exam and ultrasound.

670
01:01:28,430 --> 01:01:29,880
But you were seeing the chef.

671
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:33,880
I did. I admit I had an affair.

672
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:38,590
Well, even if I loved him, I did have an extramarital romance.

673
01:01:39,430 --> 01:01:45,430
Well, being raised by a strait-laced father full of Confucian ideals,

674
01:01:45,430 --> 01:01:47,620
I also didn't know it could be used as a card like this.

675
01:01:47,620 --> 01:01:51,700
I had an extramarital affair, but I couldn't sleep with him.

676
01:01:52,420 --> 01:01:55,620
No, I  didn't. 

677
01:01:55,620 --> 01:02:01,370
If you  are a virgin who has been married for six years, who should bear the responsibility?

678
01:02:01,370 --> 01:02:07,600
No matter how wonderful TOP is, your specialized skills can not extend to a married couple's bed.

679
01:02:08,820 --> 01:02:14,110
In our country, not having sex has not been accepted as a direct cause for divorce.

680
01:02:14,110 --> 01:02:16,580
I can't say.   That's what you are saying.

681
01:02:16,580 --> 01:02:20,080
Could you take a look at the next document.

682
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:25,590
 Text messages to  Wan Joon join her in counseling sessions 

683
01:02:25,590 --> 01:02:29,630
Throughout my marriage, in order to solve the issue of having a sexless marriage,

684
01:02:29,630 --> 01:02:33,170
that is the evidence of texts I sent to my husband to come to counseling.

685
01:02:33,170 --> 01:02:39,050
He never came once  but I  participated fully.

686
01:02:41,150 --> 01:02:45,410
It's going to be a dirty fight if we end up going to the court.

687
01:02:46,870 --> 01:02:49,560
I was afraid,

688
01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:53,270
but now I don't care anymore.

689
01:02:53,270 --> 01:02:56,860
Then, what you want is money?

690
01:02:56,860 --> 01:03:00,660
Parents' retirement budget, my sibling's study abroad expenses,

691
01:03:00,660 --> 01:03:02,990
and a place for me to stay

692
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:07,360
I need them all.

693
01:03:25,620 --> 01:03:30,960
- I thought you guys don't have sex. You are sexless right? 
 - Yes.

694
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:33,060
Since when?

695
01:03:33,060 --> 01:03:37,440
1 year after the marriage..? I think.

696
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:39,780
 No matter how wonderful TOP is, 

697
01:03:39,780 --> 01:03:43,730
 Its specialized skills cannot extend to a couple's bed. 

698
01:03:46,570 --> 01:03:52,410
 I've been married for 6 years but we never spent a night together. 

699
01:03:59,560 --> 01:04:03,630
 News Patch   
Park Tae Ho and Heo Yoon Do,

700
01:04:10,390 --> 01:04:13,330
Chief! Chief!

701
01:04:13,330 --> 01:04:16,540
Hold on hold on, let me get this through first.

702
01:04:16,540 --> 01:04:18,990
I can make it work that way.

703
01:04:18,990 --> 01:04:22,530
What is it? Did you sleep? I don't have time to sleep, what's up?

704
01:04:22,530 --> 01:04:25,110
Park Tae Ho is the son of Im Soon. Here's the family relationship certificate.

705
01:04:25,110 --> 01:04:26,070
How did you get this?

706
01:04:26,070 --> 01:04:29,290
Detective Park's daughter. When I was going to write an interview,

707
01:04:29,290 --> 01:04:32,500
You gave me the movie director's number the other day.  And that's how it got stuck.

708
01:04:32,500 --> 01:04:35,740
You're a crazily beautiful woman. You've become a master.

709
01:04:35,740 --> 01:04:37,780
It's great right?

710
01:04:37,780 --> 01:04:39,200
What to do next?

711
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:42,030
What to do? Gotta confirm with my eyes.

712
01:04:51,290 --> 01:04:53,690
 News Patch Editor Kim Boo Gi 

713
01:04:55,630 --> 01:04:57,060
Hello,

714
01:04:57,060 --> 01:04:59,000
 Park Tae Ho? 

715
01:05:08,390 --> 01:05:10,670
Wrong number.

716
01:05:11,570 --> 01:05:13,660
It's not him.

717
01:05:22,280 --> 01:05:24,000
- What did he say? 
 - It's right.  It's him.

718
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,530
When he heard the name Park Tae Ho, it was like he froze.

719
01:05:26,530 --> 01:05:28,190
My instinct is never wrong.

720
01:05:28,190 --> 01:05:29,820
I don't think it was right before.

721
01:05:29,820 --> 01:05:31,770
When I was doing great. I'm done!

722
01:05:31,770 --> 01:05:32,930
Fine, go ahead.

723
01:05:32,930 --> 01:05:36,350
It's 100% guaranteed there's something between Park Tae Ho and Heo Yoon Do.

724
01:05:36,350 --> 01:05:38,470
My instinct was right.

725
01:05:39,250 --> 01:05:41,150
- wow! 
 Gwang Mi!

726
01:05:54,970 --> 01:05:58,350
 Park Tae Ho? Park Tae Ho? 

727
01:06:17,720 --> 01:06:20,440
How should I cook?

728
01:06:21,260 --> 01:06:23,850
Cooked? Raw?

729
01:06:23,850 --> 01:06:26,320
Or ripen it, huh?

730
01:06:27,550 --> 01:06:29,410
Yes.

731
01:06:38,620 --> 01:06:41,350
Oh yeah, Gwang Mi.

732
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:03,360
Right I'm Tae Ho. Top performing student Oh Gwang Mi?

733
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:08,490
Oh, my keen insight!

734
01:07:08,490 --> 01:07:10,620
Nice to meet you, friend.

735
01:07:11,580 --> 01:07:15,780
My mom is in jail, she got framed as a murderer.

736
01:07:15,780 --> 01:07:21,430
Not only you, all my middle school friends think of me as a son of the murderer.

737
01:07:21,430 --> 01:07:26,890
The truth is not that, but I didn't want to explain so I pretended I'm not him.

738
01:07:36,070 --> 01:07:41,930
I am going to the court for review about the case from 15 years ago.

739
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:47,380
Of course, if TOP knows, everything's going up in smoke.

740
01:07:47,380 --> 01:07:50,140
Aren't you afraid of me who knows all about you?

741
01:07:50,140 --> 01:07:53,010
I don't fully trust News Patch.

742
01:07:53,010 --> 01:07:58,100
Even though you used to write articles raising suspicions about murders in the past,

743
01:07:58,100 --> 01:08:00,870
however, you've held hands with TOP.

744
01:08:03,350 --> 01:08:08,550
And in addition, unlike TOP, I have no carrots to tempt you.

745
01:08:08,550 --> 01:08:11,140
If you say you're not afraid of TOP, I'd be lying.

746
01:08:11,140 --> 01:08:13,870
Is it possible to resurrect a case from the past?

747
01:08:13,870 --> 01:08:18,750
If it's impossible, why are you still unable to abandon the case?

748
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:24,500
Obsession?  Stubbornness? Or ambition as a reporter?

749
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:28,890
I will place just one more reason on top of that.

750
01:08:30,690 --> 01:08:32,630
Sense of righteousness.

751
01:08:35,700 --> 01:08:38,430
I had it once but I lost it.

752
01:08:39,460 --> 01:08:43,850
I must get it back.

753
01:09:13,320 --> 01:09:16,860
I have faith.  I'm going.

754
01:09:24,900 --> 01:09:31,000
Wow, is that truly fat Park Tae Ho from middle school? He's so cool.

755
01:09:31,030 --> 01:09:33,530
Lawyer Heo looks ready to blow something up.

756
01:09:33,530 --> 01:09:36,950
He's a real man.  He looks like me.

757
01:09:36,950 --> 01:09:39,790
- How so?  
 - Every which way.

758
01:09:42,320 --> 01:09:47,930
So? Do you think Reporter Kim Boo Gi will join us in dredging  up a 15 years old murder case?

759
01:09:47,930 --> 01:09:51,500
Yes.  It won't be bad for us/

760
01:09:51,500 --> 01:09:55,800
There's no downside to have credible media at a crucial moment.

761
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:59,150
Based on the assumption he won't betray you.

762
01:10:00,230 --> 01:10:04,020
Anyway, it's hit or miss when my identity is not unknown any more.

763
01:10:04,020 --> 01:10:10,280
Furthermore, when you consider Reporter Kim hasn't abandoned the case for 15 years, he's credible.

764
01:10:10,280 --> 01:10:12,200
That's true.

765
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:26,450
- Who's this? 
  - The  woman Mo Wan Joon used to see.

766
01:10:27,500 --> 01:10:29,630
Just because one says there's a woman out there,

767
01:10:29,630 --> 01:10:34,770
do you understand there was never any sex  throughout the marriage?

768
01:10:34,770 --> 01:10:38,970
I can't say.  I have no experience in that area.

769
01:10:38,970 --> 01:10:41,910
I met an employee at the detective agency my sister-in-law Bae Seok Jin used.

770
01:10:41,910 --> 01:10:43,870
- Really? 
 - Yeah.

771
01:10:43,870 --> 01:10:47,930
Anyway, it wouldn't be bad for our work if we learn more about my family.

772
01:10:47,930 --> 01:10:49,300
That is true.

773
01:10:49,300 --> 01:10:54,080
The employee there said that when he was trailing her for more than six months,  there was a pattern to her behavior.

774
01:10:54,080 --> 01:10:57,910
- What kind? 
-Once or twice a week she goes shopping.

775
01:10:57,910 --> 01:11:01,790
And without fail that night she takes a shopping bag to an apartment.

776
01:11:01,790 --> 01:11:04,730
It's the same pattern every time.

777
01:11:04,730 --> 01:11:07,990
I don't know about it well, but do all couples who have affairs act like that?

778
01:11:07,990 --> 01:11:11,090
I'm no expert either, but something strikes me as odd.

779
01:11:11,090 --> 01:11:15,720
So on the day the woman goes shopping, I told him to contact me.

780
01:11:15,720 --> 01:11:16,690
Wh-what are going to do?

781
01:11:16,690 --> 01:11:20,030
Go straight onward! It's my style!

782
01:11:20,990 --> 01:11:26,350
To Ha Yeong Soo, Mo Wan Jin is not a son but almost a religion.

783
01:11:26,350 --> 01:11:32,620
If we can identify Mo Wan Joon's weakness, we can use it as a card to move Ha Yeong Seo.

784
01:11:33,340 --> 01:11:38,640
What Choi Na Ri failed at... maybe Mo Wan Joon will make up for it.

785
01:11:40,700 --> 01:11:43,400
You are really gifted.

786
01:11:47,020 --> 01:11:49,350
Wow.

787
01:11:49,350 --> 01:11:51,870
He said she went shopping today.

788
01:11:54,230 --> 01:11:56,890
I'm going to be a bit busy today.

789
01:12:11,410 --> 01:12:13,600
Cocky bitch.

790
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:19,550
She said a principle was more important than money and in the end she catches me off guard on her way out.

791
01:12:24,450 --> 01:12:30,370
I'm sick of her duplicity.

792
01:12:30,370 --> 01:12:34,150
Isn't there anyone who isn't duplicitous?

793
01:12:35,440 --> 01:12:38,460
Well, that is true.

794
01:12:39,460 --> 01:12:43,320
Baek Soo Jin is attractive to anyone looking at her.

795
01:12:43,320 --> 01:12:46,290
Why did you disappoint her so badly?

796
01:12:46,290 --> 01:12:49,690
Do you like that style, Director?

797
01:12:49,690 --> 01:12:51,230
I wouldn't think so...

798
01:12:51,230 --> 01:12:55,290
Baek Soo Jin and you have different opinions.

799
01:13:00,140 --> 01:13:02,690
Did you lie to me?

800
01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:07,620
- What lie? 
 - Don't you remember?

801
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:19,480
Baek Soo Jin produced a physical evidence of a medical certificate

802
01:13:19,480 --> 01:13:22,560
proving she is a virgin.

803
01:13:25,390 --> 01:13:31,230
As best as I can remember, you said you had sexual relations with her in the first year of marriage.

804
01:13:31,230 --> 01:13:33,200
I did say that.

805
01:13:36,190 --> 01:13:39,170
How long are you going to interrogate me like this, Director Han?

806
01:13:39,170 --> 01:13:42,630
I don't intend to offend you. You know that.

807
01:13:42,630 --> 01:13:46,350
I must know everything about the leader of MC Group.

808
01:13:46,350 --> 01:13:49,860
Even if you have or don't have a mole on your butt.

809
01:13:53,050 --> 01:13:57,030
So, tell me what you want to know.

810
01:13:57,030 --> 01:14:01,740
Do you perhaps prefer men?

811
01:14:08,050 --> 01:14:12,030
You know better than anyone that I have a woman.

812
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:41,540
You are a transgender, aren't you?

813
01:14:43,530 --> 01:14:50,610


814
01:14:50,610 --> 01:14:53,360

815

 Graceful Family Preview 

819
01:15:16,760 --> 01:15:20,090
 I'm telling you to bring over all of
Ha Yeong Seo's works right now! 

820
01:15:20,090 --> 01:15:22,110
 Mo Seok Hui just now at the art gallery 

821
01:15:22,110 --> 01:15:22,870
 Mo Seok Hui did that? 

822
01:15:22,870 --> 01:15:26,910
 You even wanted my mom's art, too, so how does it feel having stolen all of it? 

823
01:15:26,910 --> 01:15:28,830
 You want to become the chairman of MC Group? 

824
01:15:28,830 --> 01:15:31,850
 I think I would be trustworthy with a partner like you. 

825
01:15:31,850 --> 01:15:33,450
 What's important is winning. 

826
01:15:33,450 --> 01:15:34,490
 is it facing it head on? 

827
01:15:34,490 --> 01:15:37,420
 I'm curious as to what Director Han's mission this time is. 

828
01:15:37,420 --> 01:15:38,700
 Isn't this Mo Wan Joon? 

829
01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:41,550
 Why did Mo Wan Joon go see my mom that day? 

830
01:15:41,550 --> 01:15:44,820
 By chance, did you ever meet up with my mom in private? 

831
01:15:44,820 --> 01:15:48,990
