 Graceful Family 

6
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:33,980
 (Episode 11) 
 What?  Pay settlement money?

7
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,780
You're in college, yet, you go around getting into fights in clubs?!

8
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:43,000
There will be no settlement money.

9
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:46,300
- Accept the legal consequences. 
 - What?

10
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:51,520
Father... father...

11
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,510
It wasn't that I deliberately was violent.

12
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:58,610
I learned there are times in the world when a punch speaks louder than a word.

13
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:01,700
I'll make sure never to make that mistake again.

14
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:04,340
Don't carelessly make a promise you can't keep.

15
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:09,860
Your mere existence is harmful!  Harmful!

16
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:13,150
Actually, every human's existence harms the earth.

17
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:14,630
What?

18
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:20,700


19
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:24,170
By the way, where are you having your birthday party, Wan Joon?

20
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:27,740
I was thinking about having it on Ibiza in Spain,

21
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:31,120
but for ordinary friends it might be a bit expensive,  so

22
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,040
shall I just have it a a hotel?

23
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,050
Let's charter a plane.

24
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:37,630
Take all the friends you want.

25
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:42,620
Yes.  All of them is best.  That's how a party should be held.

26
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:48,080
In this era, money is power.

27
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:51,970
There is nothing you can't do if you have that power.

28
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:56,210
How much could it possibly be? What problem is there?

29
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:58,880
Yes. I understand.

30
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:04,850
Ibiza is it.

31
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:08,650
It's just an island covered with clover.

32
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:10,640
Have a great time.

33
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:24,390
 The temptation to do anything if you become the master of MC Group. 

34
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:28,850
 From then, ambition began to wiggle in his heart. 

35
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:40,700
 Oh, Tae Ha. Are you gonna go? 

36
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:43,220
 Who's coming? Of course, I'm going! 

37
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:47,220
 If you're back from the States, you have to go!  

38
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:04,370
 Even after Wan Soo was born, your father tried to break up with me. 

39
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:08,910
 However, he changed after I gave birth to you. 

40
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,700
 He recognized in an instant how brilliant and unique our Wan Joon is. 

41
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:21,350
 There's no child of a chaebol family who's perfect in all areas, 

42
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:24,200
 whether it's sports or school, like how you are. 

43
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:28,420
 You know that, thanks to you, when I go to chaebol wives get-togethers, 

44
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:31,300
 I go around holding my head high, right? 

45
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:37,000
 Thanks, Wan Joon. 

46
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,410
 You are MC's future. 

47
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:43,930
 You know you have to bear a heavy burden, too, right? 

48
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:59,900
 Would the situation been different if he had confessed his secret then? 

49
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:03,100
    

50
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,660
 Are you sure Housekeeper named Im Soon is the murderer? 

51
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:08,760
 I am sure. 

52
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:14,600
 Members of my family being interrogated as suspects... 

53
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:17,690
 it won't happen, of course, right? 

54
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:19,850
 Of course. 

55
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:23,610
 Although there was evidence left on the front door CCTV ... 

56
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,670
 I got rid of them. 

57
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,370
 What would you like to do with the deceased's belongings? 

58
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:51,450
 If you don't say anything in particular, we'll dispose of them how we see fit. 

59
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:54,940
 No. We are still the bereaved. 

60
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:57,670
 I'll take care of her belongings. 

61
00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:00,130
 Don't be concerned about them. 

62
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:02,720
 Yes.  I understand. 

63
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:17,650
 The more someone grows up receiving the family's expectations and aspirations, 

64
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:21,940
 the scarier and harder it becomes to disclose personal secrets. 

65
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:40,130
 Is this the newspaper?  

66
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,800
 I have a tip. 

67
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,910
 About the housekeeper of a villa murder incident, /i&gt; 

68
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:55,300
 someone got rid of the CCTV footage of all the visitors on that day. 

69
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,570
 But ... 

70
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:07,360
  whatever the secret, there is no way that it can exist as a secret forever. 

71
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:21,970
 Graceful Family 

72
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,900
You're a transgender, right?

73
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,500
- Did you tell Father? 
 - No.

74
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:54,390
- Why not? 
 - This news about you would be terrorizing to the Chairman.

75
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:56,430
Could you bear it?

76
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,580
Who else knows besides the two of us?

77
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,260
That's a relief.

78
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:13,540
We are burying this issue from this moment.

79
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:15,670
You may not go to the apartment anymore.

80
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:20,870
Instead, I'll arrange for a private space for you which is not visible even to a satellite.

81
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:25,340
I can't sympathize with you, and it's even further from my own preference.

82
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:28,490
Only that I acknowledge it.

83
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:33,540
Since it's for the sake of MC.

84
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,600
It's a relief we're the same when it comes to how we feel toward MC.

85
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,890
I'll see you at tomorrow's board meeting.

86
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,000
- What is this?
 - I wonder. What could this be?

87
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,880
Didn't you know he was a married man?

88
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:18,430
Ah, that ... It's not like that.

89
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:20,260
Then, what is it?

90
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:38,180
Mo Wan Joon.... is a transgender.

91
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:41,010
I heard that he came to the apartment no matter what on the day she went shopping.

92
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:43,160
So she was just shopping for him.

93
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:48,050
So the woman at the apartment was being used to fake an illicit affair.

94
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:54,790
What will happen when Mo Wan Joon is revealed to be transgender?

95
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:58,880
It will cause turmoil with the conservative directors and shareholders at the heart of it...

96
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,720
and Director Han and TOP will probably become overwhelmed with damage control.

97
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:08,800
There is just one thing I'm curious about ... Ha Yeong Seo's reaction.

98
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:17,910
   

99
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:29,790
Chief?  What are you doing not going home?

100
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:41,360
What is it?  Did something happen?

101
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,700
Gwang Mi. It's time to say goodbye.

102
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:49,400
What? Are you retiring? What's the matter all of a sudden?

103
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:52,970
Obsession, insanity, pride, bluffing, conscience,

104
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:57,200
justice, stubbornness, regret, and pathos—

105
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,870
this contains the complex history of one human being.

106
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:04,880
What are you going to do if you quit being a reporter? What am I supposed to do?

107
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,250
I have to say goodbye to this history and start a new era.

108
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:11,950
Chief, are you really going to be this disloyal?

109
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:28,070
It's an honor to welcome the new era with you.

110
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:30,200
Thanks, Gwang Mi.

111
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,000
- What's this? 
  - I told you.

112
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:40,350
That this contains one human being's tiring and difficult history.

113
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,800
Huh?

114
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:52,520
The fact that Mo Wan Joon is a transgender is shocking, but I'm a little frustrated.

115
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,300
About what?

116
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:58,780
Although it's nice to know an unknown fact about your family,

117
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:01,330
that's not our goal.

118
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:04,030
Time keeps passing,

119
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:10,100
but we haven't found any single fact or evidence which is even close to the essence of the case.

120
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:17,230
I know when you think about your mom, it's frustrating.

121
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:22,470
But we both started this knowing that it was going to be a tough fight.

122
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:25,390
I know, but even so.

123
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:30,060
Stop.  If you say one more thing that sounds weak, I'll kill you.

124
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:38,460
Lawyer Heo, you aren't alone anymore.

125
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:42,710
You said Reporter Kim Boo Gi said he would help and the same for Detective Oh/

126
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:46,610
Also, me, who's running at your side,

127
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:49,110
am I a beast?

128
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:58,790
It's Reporter Kim.  Isn't that spooky?

129
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:05,350
Yes, Reporter Kim. Right now?

130
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:15,130
Uh... what's this?

131
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,970
A man who wants to embody justice.

132
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:20,880
The girl Crush who's out looking for the truth.

133
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:25,350
The magical key that will change the two people's dream into reality.

134
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:31,810
It's the CCTV footage of the people who visited the villa on the day of the murder 15 years ago.

135
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,430
- Gwang Mi. 
 - Yes.

136
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:23,290
I mean... how did you get this?

137
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:27,080
15 years ago, a call comes into the newspaper.

138
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:31,540
Someone got rid of the CCTV footage from the housekeeper murder incident.

139
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:34,450
I was suspicious already since there wasn't a motive for the murder.

140
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:39,320
The tip-off call ignites a fire in my reporter spirit.

141
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,270
And then?

142
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:45,190
I did a follow-up, but the private security company CCTV was already gone.

143
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:49,610
But where there's illegal activity, there's always a rat.

144
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:53,510
With my unyielding feet, sweat, and with the spirit of a reporter,

145
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:57,050
right before the CCTV footage was handed over to the prosecution,

146
00:14:57,050 --> 00:15:01,110
I found the person who stole the copy, and for the sake of justice and truth,

147
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:06,060
I obtained this after handing over an unimaginable amount of money.

148
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:10,370
Based on this, I wrote an article against the wishes of the editor,

149
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:14,210
but that article was deleted, and even my house was destroyed.

150
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:16,200
In the end, I lost my job

151
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:21,280
and I reached the lowest point in my life which I don't even want to remember.

152
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:24,560
Now, it has met its new owner

153
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,760
so will this finally see the light of the world?

154
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,750
We will have to make that happen.

155
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,510
Never...

156
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:35,410
never repeat my mistake.

157
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:38,810
You know this is that dangerous, right?

158
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:40,620
Of course.

159
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,280
That day, the whole family was at our house.

160
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:50,970
Director Han, too. Now, if we can just find out when the murder occurred,

161
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:54,250
the visitor who came by right before that will be the prime suspect.

162
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:57,560
Right. So we have to see the investigation report.

163
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:02,410
But that report, do we have it or not?

164
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:06,060
In the end, this is where we keep getting stuck.

165
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:09,460
If you're the lawyer in charge, can't you access the case?

166
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:12,730
Before I met my mom, I wasn't her son on paper.

167
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:17,020
And I wasn't her lawyer either, so I couldn't access it officially.

168
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:20,850
Then you can now confidently be her lawyer.

169
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:25,330
No. I can't apply that easily since TOP might find out about my true identity.

170
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:29,080
Also, she keeps refusing the appointment of a lawyer.

171
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,670
It means Director Han's threat is still working.

172
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:35,340
The people whom we presume lead the cover-up, Mo Cheol Hui, Han Je Gook, Joo Hyeong Il...

173
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:38,420
I'm sure one of the three has it in their possession.

174
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:41,760
It's 100% impossible to get to them.

175
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:46,290
Then... is there no possibility that someone else might have it?

176
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:51,440
Oh, the one who read the incident report from front to back completely is...

177
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,780
-The judge?
-Bingo!

178
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:58,400
Judge Lee Dong Joon officially participated in my mom's case. I already looked for him.

179
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:02,170
 This court, in the name of strict law and justice, 

180
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:06,000
 under Article 250 of the Criminal Law, to defendant Im Soon,   

181
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,400
 sentences life imprisonment without parole. 

182
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:13,210
But... when I looked for him, I couldn't find out where he was at all.

183
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:17,500
Like the investigation report, it appears as though he doesn't exist.

184
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,250
But if he's alive somewhere?

185
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:21,060
We have to grasp at straws.

186
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:24,170
Historically, the number of people who fell into water and grasped at straws and lived

187
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:27,160
was seven. Whether you believe it or not.

188
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:32,410
Starting now, let's look for Judge Lee once again and make sure to find him.

189
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:35,000
Make sure.

190
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:59,090
Mom...

191
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:02,870
I finally took a step now ...

192
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:08,680
Good bye!

193
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:15,960
Yoon Do, what are you doing out here?

194
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,870
Did something happen again?

195
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:26,340
Right... suffering for 15 years...

196
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:28,700
it wasn't all for naught.

197
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:33,400
Really... a day like this comes after all.

198
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:38,640
Honestly, it was really difficult for me.

199
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:44,730
Whether I could clear her name, could I really do that?

200
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:48,870
A few times a day even, I fell into despair and got disappointed...

201
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:51,670
and lost my courage.

202
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:55,000
But...

203
00:18:58,050 --> 00:19:01,150
because you stayed by my side,

204
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:06,700
because you reassured me, I could always gain strength.

205
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:12,030
Of course, you're my son after all.

206
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:17,890
Who else but my son can do something so difficult?

207
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:23,730
Father, thank you so much.

208
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:33,270
I’m proud of you, my son..

209
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:35,380
My son...

210
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:39,740
There’s isn’t anything you can’t do in this world.

211
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:42,400
Be strong.

212
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:05,790
  I can’t sympathize, and even more, it's distasteful to me. 

213
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:08,850
 I will just acknowledge it.   

214
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:11,660
 Because it”s for MC’s sake.  

215
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:25,400
What is it?

216
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:29,010
 Some woman barged into the apartment. 

217
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:34,900
Don't call me until I contact you.

218
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:52,390
As someone so meticulous, why were you so lax about the woman you’ve been hiding?

219
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:56,640
Are you just letting it be known since you wanted to give away the fact that you’ve been having an affair?

220
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:22,870
Mo Wan Joon... you’re now one of the suspects.

221
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:42,870
Why did Mo Wan Joon visit mom that day?

222
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:47,250
If mom knew about his secret ...

223
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:12,840
After acting like you're the hippest and coolest and with the greatest sense of justice,

224
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:17,060
in the end, you’re just Mo Seok Hui who goes digging around others’ private lives...

225
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:19,060
Interesting.

226
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,800
Why are you so interested in my private life?

227
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,120
I wonder. What could it be?

228
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:30,000
Why? Do you want to become the successor to MC Group?

229
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:33,480
I wonder.

230
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:40,530
I don’t care how you identify yourself sexually.

231
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:43,370
And I don’t think it’s important .

232
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:47,750
But, does the family know?

233
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:53,000
Father is very conservative, so it’s expected.

234
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:58,060
But for the stepmom who thinks the world of her second son, I think it’ll be a little different.

235
00:22:58,490 --> 00:23:01,520
- So?
-I'm just curious.

236
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:07,480
Whether the stepmom knows, too, or anyone else does.

237
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,700
I reject any interest in my personal life.

238
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:14,700
You're not just anyone, you're the future heir of MC Group,

239
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,850
You can’t really say it’s your personal life.

240
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:19,540
I guess you’re expecting some huge catastrophe

241
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:21,970
But unfortunately nothing will change.

242
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:27,300
Really? I guess you’re getting coached by the best strategist.

243
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:28,720
But in the end you’re just a puppet.

244
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:33,470
You’re the one who had high expectations thinking that you found my biggest flaw,

245
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:34,650
But too bad.

246
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:40,160
If Father finds out, could you really become the successor?

247
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,640
The important thing is...

248
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,140
winning.

249
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:59,560
You didn’t shop very well. Their line is not that great this year.

250
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,860
Get rid of this yourself.

251
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:05,180
By any chance,

252
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:08,930
have you met with my mom secretly?

253
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:17,680
Me, why?

254
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:20,340
If not, never mind.

255
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:22,750
Sleep tight.

256
00:24:56,170 --> 00:24:57,630
Hey, Seok Hui!

257
00:24:57,630 --> 00:25:01,120
- Seriously... Why don't you knock?
 - Oh, knock, knock, knock.

258
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,600
Wan Joon’s facial expression was totally rotten.

259
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,590
His face doesn't usually look good.

260
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:17,300
What's this?

261
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:20,960
It's Wang Joon's. What do you think?

262
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:34,830
Thak kid!  ... It's a bit surprising.

263
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:38,970
But, I don't care about people's personal matters,

264
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:43,090
Anyway, we should never violate civil and personal privacy rights.

265
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:45,400
I'm a humanist.

266
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,820
- Oppa.
- Yes?

267
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:57,100
What do you think about my mom?

268
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:04,430
She was a cool artist.

269
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:07,210
But all of a sudden, why do you ask?

270
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:10,270
Seok Hui, you miss your mom, right?

271
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:12,080
Just because.

272
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:16,550
Get some rest.

273
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:21,460
Right. Hold on.

274
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:32,490
What is it?

275
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:34,410
A gift.

276
00:26:57,060 --> 00:27:00,300
You want us to move forward on Wan Joon's succession?

277
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:02,020
Yes.

278
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:05,760
You're the one who said you would adjust the timing.

279
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:09,800
The external economic situation is not positive. Let's complete the succession quickly and

280
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:14,750
under Chairman Mo Wan Joon I think it is good that we will have a powerful drive.

281
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:18,630
If that's how you see it, then...

282
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:22,050
Then, I'll carry it out that way.

283
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:25,380
Eat something before you leave.

284
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,420
I'm okay.

285
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,930
Some people.   You never give in to me.

286
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,900
Even if it's a long time since I saw you, you never have a gap where you yield.

287
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:49,210
Let's eat.

288
00:27:57,290 --> 00:27:59,180
 Who  is it? 

289
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:12,130
The picture of Director Han sitting at the breakfast table isn't bad.

290
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:14,320
It's refreshing,

291
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:19,620
It's like a family, but not a family. Shall we say the aesthetics of a boundary?

292
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:22,320
Yes. The atmosphere is nice,

293
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:25,940
Director Han, we often listen to each other at breakfast.

294
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:31,520
This time there is a scenario here.

295
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:35,200
The story is really interesting.

296
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:41,130
But it's much more similar to the movie "The Danish Girl."

297
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:47,060
You all know it, right?  The story of transgender painters Lili Elbe and Gerda Wegener.

298
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:57,530
I do. That movie was good.

299
00:28:57,530 --> 00:29:02,780
Now even in the Korean market,  aren't transgender and gay stories are doing well as subjects?

300
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:07,570
Yes.  We too must change our thinking about sexual minorities.

301
00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:10,270
Do you think they could be easily changed?

302
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:15,910
It's a subject that gets good feedback, then there's a possibility.

303
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:22,520
You seem brimming with confidence over everything, Director Han.

304
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:29,370
Actually, for my graduation project I made a short film about a lesbian painter.

305
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:34,980
But the subject was so unconventional for the time, it didn't draw much attention.

306
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:39,090
I was so ahead of the times.

307
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:45,090
He who laughs last, laughs longest. ( In German )

308
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:50,520
What?  You speak German well?

309
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:53,830
You couldn't even tell the difference between  Spanish and German.

310
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:57,100
Huh?  Was I like that?

311
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:59,410
Shut up!

312
00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:06,000
To start the morning talking about gay people or whatever is disrespectful.

313
00:30:29,170 --> 00:30:30,660
When did you know?

314
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:34,850
Is that important? I think Dad can't even imagine it yet.

315
00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:37,070
So you're going to tell him?

316
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:41,580
It's not your style to be obsessive over someone's  lifestyle.

317
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:46,130
A pre-emptive strike to shut me up...

318
00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:51,520
Well, I am weak toward minorities and underdogs.

319
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:54,030
I guess it worked.

320
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:02,960
But I wonder what your mission is.

321
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:06,710
To get rid of the transgender?

322
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:11,830
You erase everything dirty from MC  Group.

323
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:18,650
Work hard.

324
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:31,490
- You want me to cancel the exhibition of pictures in America? 
 - Yes.

325
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:36,050
- But why? 
 - Miss Seok Hui is smart.

326
00:31:36,050 --> 00:31:39,070
She's not going to the US again, does that matter?

327
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:42,190
Please cancel it before something bigger happens.

328
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:46,980
Do not interfere with my creative activities.

329
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:50,740
I'm sure I prevented it from the start.

330
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:52,470
I make the decisions about my business.

331
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:56,540
Know that this is not a request.

332
00:32:06,290 --> 00:32:08,630
Loser.

333
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:20,450
Miss Seok Hui and Wan Soo both seem to know.

334
00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:24,750
Seok Hui must have visited the apartment yesterday.

335
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:30,280
Because both of them are alike, it was a natural sequence  that Hyung would know.

336
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:34,390
First , erase all the files stored on your PC.

337
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:41,170
Check the activities of Miss Seok Hui and Young Master Won Soo yesterday.

338
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:52,810
Have you been well?

339
00:32:52,810 --> 00:32:54,820
Yeah.

340
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:58,990
Mom, today I want to ask you a question.

341
00:32:58,990 --> 00:33:00,960
What is it?

342
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:10,860
Do you remember this person?

343
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:14,220
That is the chairman.

344
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:17,740
This person was the Madame who lived in the main house.

345
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:21,880
Did you see these people before?

346
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:44,930
Lawyer Han Je Gook called you that day to return to the house as soon as possible

347
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:51,990
While you were with me that day, all of these people went to Mo Seok Hui's mother's house.

348
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:53,800
Is that so?

349
00:34:04,650 --> 00:34:06,360
Mom.

350
00:34:07,690 --> 00:34:11,860
When you get out of here, what do you want to do the most?

351
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:18,550
I want to cook a meal for my Tae Ho.

352
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,880
No.

353
00:34:23,410 --> 00:34:26,620
When you get out, I must cook for you.

354
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:28,930
I'm a good cook.

355
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:34,060
You laughed.

356
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:45,600
Tae Ho,  I am fine so will you always take care of yourself?

357
00:34:49,610 --> 00:34:54,200
Don't worry about me. Hang in there, Mom.

358
00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:04,320
Last night Young Master's car was at home.

359
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:07,890
He stopped at a cafe on his way to go to write on his script and didn't go anywhere special.

360
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:10,320
MIss Seok Hui visited the apartment.

361
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:14,250
Check whether  Vice-Chairmam' Mo Wan Joon's PC has been hacked.

362
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:18,300
After that observe the miss and young master as to who they meet and what they do.

363
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:19,600
I will.

364
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:24,300
- Also, summon Young Master Wan Soo to my office. 
 -Yes.

365
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:35,890
When did you learn that the vice-chairman is transgender?

366
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:43,480
But, what is important about that?

367
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:56,460
Director Han. I'm a bit concerned about my father's biases.

368
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:59,900
It's better that he doesn't know the awkward truth.

369
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:03,930
Well, it's true that truth can't satisfy everyone.

370
00:36:03,930 --> 00:36:09,510
A 10% share.  You would have to protect it, wouldn't you?

371
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:16,490
I guess so.

372
00:36:16,490 --> 00:36:22,720
Just how many movies could I make with a 10% share?

373
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:25,720
That's a lot of money.

374
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:31,860
If that should also disappear, I think I would be extremely unhappy.

375
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:37,940
You being clearly aware of what situation you're in is beneficial to all of us.

376
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:26,170
 On the same day, Mom  and Wan Joon were at the same place. 

377
00:37:26,170 --> 00:37:29,490
 What if Mom and Wan Joon met that day? 

378
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:37,470
  Why did he come to meet Mom on the day of the incident? 

379
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:50,000
 2004 Gender Exhibit 

380
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:54,860
 Meet the First Gender Writer Exhibition Planner in Korea. 

381
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:01,360
Curator Oh Eun Joo...

382
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:10,800
 Curator Oh Eun Joo 

383
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:17,120
  Oh Eun Joo 

384
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:37,060
What is it?

385
00:38:41,330 --> 00:38:44,090
Isn't this person Mo Wan Joon?

386
00:38:44,090 --> 00:38:47,290
Mom and Wan Joon were at the same place on the same day.

387
00:38:47,290 --> 00:38:50,250
So the two of them met?

388
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:53,420
I don't know yet if the picture was taken accidentally or if they met.

389
00:38:57,010 --> 00:39:00,170
This is the curator who organized the gender exhibit then.

390
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:03,900
Let's go.

391
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:13,060
What about the judge?

392
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:16,470
Oh.  Not yet.

393
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:20,020
I'm going to find him. I must.

394
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:25,430
I must find him personally and find out on what basis

395
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:27,810
he sentenced Mom to life imprisonment.

396
00:39:27,810 --> 00:39:31,310
Let's go.  I'll make a call first.

397
00:39:31,310 --> 00:39:35,790
Don't you know I'm a multi-tasker?  I already phoned on the way here.

398
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:38,850
Yes. Mutli-

399
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:49,680
Goodness.  It's Sunbae Ahn Jae Rim.

400
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:55,530
Are you somehow related to Sunbae

401
00:39:55,530 --> 00:39:58,080
I'm her daughter.

402
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:00,390
I was her junior in art.

403
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:03,410
Oh, I see.

404
00:40:03,410 --> 00:40:10,020
When she suddenly died, it was a big shock.

405
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:12,230
But, what brings you here?

406
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:16,120
You were the first person ot ogranize a gender exhibit in our country.

407
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:17,950
True.

408
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:22,640
But, I think this picture was taken then.

409
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:25,750
Do you remember this person?

410
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:33,210
Oh.  I took this picture of Sunbae then.  I remember.

411
00:40:33,210 --> 00:40:39,400
But after I took the picture, I think Sunbae acted like she knew the guy in back.

412
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:42,100
- Was there anything else? 
 - You know.

413
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:46,290
Even now, it's hard to confidently come out, and then one couldn't even speak.

414
00:40:46,290 --> 00:40:50,770
This person, I recall made a rapid escape.

415
00:40:50,770 --> 00:40:55,830
You really have a good memory.

416
00:40:55,830 --> 00:41:00,160
At the time I ... Sunbae's influence was very broad.

417
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:05,330
There are all the transgender acquaintances.  I even remember joking.

418
00:41:05,330 --> 00:41:08,110
It was such a special day that

419
00:41:08,110 --> 00:41:10,880
although Sunbae was sick at home

420
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:15,010
after I begged and begged her  against her will she came to the exhibition.

421
00:41:29,350 --> 00:41:31,150
Hey there!

422
00:41:35,770 --> 00:41:40,300
Did you say you are Seok Hui? Wait a minute.

423
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:49,540
Does only the president take care of your mother's paintings?

424
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:54,140
Sunbae's work was really good.  Wasn't it a shame?

425
00:41:54,140 --> 00:42:00,030
Actually, there was recently a rumor that pictures similar to her style have appeared,

426
00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:02,420
so I was thinking about Sunbae out of the blue.

427
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:04,910
Was it because I was going to meet you like this?

428
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:11,990
If you ever think of doing an exhibition of your mother's paintings, please contact me anytime.

429
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:28,340
Your mother already knew Wan Joon was transgender 15 years ago.

430
00:42:31,830 --> 00:42:33,830
What are you thinking so hard about?

431
00:42:33,830 --> 00:42:37,210
Huh?  It's nothing.

432
00:42:37,210 --> 00:42:43,460
Mo Wan Joon.  He must have been very worried that your mother had caught his secret.

433
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:46,520
And two days after the exhibition my mother was killed.

434
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:52,130
Perhaps out of fear of her revealing his secret, he went to visit her.

435
00:42:52,130 --> 00:42:57,370
Two days after the exhibition. The day of the murder.

436
00:42:57,370 --> 00:43:02,400
For me he is the prime suspect.

437
00:43:24,470 --> 00:43:27,370
Go home safely.  I'll contact you.

438
00:43:27,370 --> 00:43:29,080
Go ahead.

439
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:41,010
 Actually, there was recently a rumor that pictures similar to her style have appeared. 

440
00:43:41,010 --> 00:43:43,500
 I was thinking about Sunbae out of the blue. 

441
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:46,120
 Is it because I was going to meet you like this? 

442
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:57,320
Is the Director out?

443
00:43:57,320 --> 00:44:01,740
She didn't come in today.  What brings you here?

444
00:44:03,230 --> 00:44:05,090
Oh. Miss.

445
00:44:05,090 --> 00:44:07,800
Go back to work.  I'll look at the pictures.

446
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:09,520
Yes.

447
00:44:48,310 --> 00:44:52,370
 Y. S. 

448
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:07,990
What is it?

449
00:46:07,990 --> 00:46:10,760
Mo Seo Hui is in the art gallery,

450
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:14,120
You two, go!

451
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:17,110
Now she is in the gallery and make a scene.

452
00:46:17,110 --> 00:46:20,340
Wow, she's full of surprises.

453
00:46:24,270 --> 00:46:27,400
What? Mo Seok Hui did what?

454
00:46:28,530 --> 00:46:32,380
Take my paintings hung in the lobby immediately to the storage.

455
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:35,160
Ok.

456
00:46:44,550 --> 00:46:51,190
Bring it to me. Right now bring all of Ha Yeong Seo's pieces.

457
00:46:51,190 --> 00:46:56,090
Miss, without the approval from the Director, I can't move around the pieces.

458
00:46:56,090 --> 00:47:00,830
Is that so? Then I'll have to get them by myself.

459
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:06,530
What's going on? Why are you doing this?

460
00:47:06,530 --> 00:47:09,920
Miss, this is a public area of the gallery.  You can't do this.

461
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:13,780
It makes sense to scam in the public area?

462
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:17,570
Let's get out of here for now.

463
00:47:17,570 --> 00:47:20,020
No, I don't want to.

464
00:47:20,020 --> 00:47:23,370
I don't know what's going on but this place belongs to Ha Yeong Seo.

465
00:47:23,370 --> 00:47:25,870
Don't get worked up.

466
00:47:27,550 --> 00:47:31,710
Let's get out of here please. Listen to me.

467
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:46,120
What's going on?

468
00:47:49,470 --> 00:47:52,620
Do you know what that painting means?

469
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:18,450
 What is the title of this art? 

470
00:48:18,450 --> 00:48:22,670
 I haven't  decided yet. 

471
00:48:22,670 --> 00:48:24,820
 Why? Do you like it? 

472
00:48:24,820 --> 00:48:26,350
 Totally. 

473
00:48:26,350 --> 00:48:29,030
 When completed, I want it in my room. 

474
00:48:29,030 --> 00:48:33,320
 Should we? Anything my daughter wants. 

475
00:48:34,370 --> 00:48:38,290
 Mom,  you must be so happy that you are such a talented artist. 

476
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:42,560
 You are pretty and smart with good scores. 

477
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:45,050
 - Really? 
 - Of course. 

478
00:48:45,050 --> 00:48:48,850
 You can't ace everything. 

479
00:48:50,130 --> 00:48:54,420
 Right, I'm pretty and smart. 

480
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:11,750
I see.

481
00:49:12,910 --> 00:49:20,350
She stole other's art pieces and pretend to be an artist. She would have been too scared to do a press release.

482
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:24,400
She even wanted my mom's artwork.

483
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:29,240
Now there is another reason why Ha Yeong Seo wanted to kill my mom.

484
00:49:29,990 --> 00:49:34,220
Ha Yeong Seo, Mo Wan Joon...

485
00:49:34,220 --> 00:49:38,390
both had a sufficient reason to kill my mom.

486
00:49:51,330 --> 00:49:57,820
 You're clearly aware of what situation you're in is beneficial to all of us. 

487
00:50:04,140 --> 00:50:05,500
Drinking again?

488
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:10,310
I don't want to see you drinking at home.

489
00:50:11,630 --> 00:50:12,940
Do you even want to see me in the house?

490
00:50:12,940 --> 00:50:15,060
What?

491
00:50:17,030 --> 00:50:20,800
And you, do you think the company is your playground?

492
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:24,120
Stop going in and out.

493
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:27,200
You just concentration on making a decent movie.

494
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:31,830
Well, not like you'd do that right anyway.

495
00:50:31,830 --> 00:50:35,590
How great would it be if you are like Wan Joon even by just half.

496
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:39,520
So lacking...

497
00:51:01,270 --> 00:51:04,810
I didn't know you are good at stealing.

498
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:09,670
Wait, your major is stealing.

499
00:51:09,670 --> 00:51:10,810
Get away.

500
00:51:10,810 --> 00:51:15,370
You took the other wife's life, and other's art pieces.

501
00:51:15,370 --> 00:51:18,370
How is it to have all by stealing?

502
00:51:18,370 --> 00:51:20,530
I wonder.

503
00:51:37,620 --> 00:51:40,520
Happy birthday!

504
00:51:43,860 --> 00:51:45,940
Happy birthday,  Mother.

505
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:52,040
Madame,  people all over have sent  gifts and birthday messages.

506
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:54,530
Yes? Shall I take a look?

507
00:51:54,530 --> 00:51:58,200
First of all, let me read the congratulatory  messages.

508
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:00,410
Happy birthday,

509
00:52:00,410 --> 00:52:04,270
please take good care of Korea's art and culture in the future too.

510
00:52:04,270 --> 00:52:08,940
A message and present sent by the head of Korea National Gallery of  Art..

511
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:15,520
I wish your graceful beauty lasts forever.

512
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:20,710
It's a message from the Minister of Land's wife.

513
00:52:31,910 --> 00:52:35,600
Why? What is it?

514
00:53:32,990 --> 00:53:35,280
What is this?

515
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:38,140
Honey, are you all right?

516
00:54:45,350 --> 00:54:52,290
What is all of this?

517
00:54:52,290 --> 00:54:54,520
Answer me.

518
00:54:58,210 --> 00:55:01,970
Explain!!! You son-of-a bitch!

519
00:55:20,210 --> 00:55:22,170
Father.

520
00:55:24,490 --> 00:55:26,850
What kind of son was I to you, Dad?

521
00:55:26,850 --> 00:55:28,250
What?

522
00:55:28,250 --> 00:55:34,570
I had to ride a horse if that's what you wanted.

523
00:55:34,570 --> 00:55:39,790
Yes, Father, I don't like riding a horse.

524
00:55:39,790 --> 00:55:45,930
If you want, I had to swim like a swimmer.

525
00:55:47,770 --> 00:55:50,520
But I am afraid of water.

526
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:56,770
It's all because you wanted, I kept my top academic score at school. Why?

527
00:55:59,330 --> 00:56:02,430
Because it made you happy.

528
00:56:02,430 --> 00:56:05,850
I liked that it made you happy.

529
00:56:05,850 --> 00:56:12,930
But Father, even once, have you ever asked me what I want?

530
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:22,230
What I want now,

531
00:56:22,230 --> 00:56:25,660
what I want to be.

532
00:56:25,660 --> 00:56:29,090
Not even once, have you ever asked?

533
00:56:35,510 --> 00:56:40,720
Yes. I, Mo Wan Joon, am a transgender.

534
00:56:43,230 --> 00:56:49,870
Around 14 years old? How do you think it was for me when I first realized who I am?

535
00:56:50,950 --> 00:56:53,150
I was afraid.

536
00:56:53,150 --> 00:56:56,670
The fear and worry if you find out, you would kill me.

537
00:56:56,670 --> 00:57:00,860
So I had to be more perfect and be a good son.

538
00:57:00,860 --> 00:57:06,340
I was afraid to die. ... Because I was scared,  in order to live, I clenched by teeth and endured.

539
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:10,840
Actually, I am still afraid.

540
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:15,910
Father, are you going to kick me out of the house?

541
00:57:15,910 --> 00:57:22,200
If I leave the house, may I live freely?

542
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:26,680
Please let go of the Wan Joon of the past.

543
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:28,690
Please abandon me of that time.

544
00:57:32,210 --> 00:57:37,090
Couldn't you just acknowledge the current  Mo Wan Joon?

545
00:57:37,860 --> 00:57:40,390
Get out immediately.

546
00:57:47,330 --> 00:57:49,810
I said to get out.

547
00:57:56,820 --> 00:57:59,710
Wan Joon.  Wan Joon.

548
00:57:59,710 --> 00:58:01,740
Wan Joon!

549
00:58:29,150 --> 00:58:31,340
Who was it?  Who did this?

550
00:58:33,550 --> 00:58:35,850
Who the hell did this?

551
00:58:37,630 --> 00:58:43,630
Did whoever did this think this would destroy Wan Joon?

552
00:58:43,630 --> 00:58:45,780
Not a chance.

553
00:58:45,780 --> 00:58:51,290
No matter what anyone says, I am proud of my son Wan Joon.

554
00:58:54,460 --> 00:58:58,160
I won't allow anyone to even touch him with a fingertip.

555
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:00,350
Do you understand?

556
00:59:11,670 --> 00:59:16,870
What is the great power of love Mother has for Wan Jun?

557
00:59:16,870 --> 00:59:22,790
It's amazing.  Motherhood is so amazing.

558
00:59:58,530 --> 01:00:01,550
You were five years old.

559
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:06,760
You like it when I put my lipstick on you.

560
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:10,780
I just thought you were a very curious child.

561
01:00:10,780 --> 01:00:16,400
But then, it continued even after ...

562
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:21,080
When you entered elementary school, you started to hide

563
01:00:21,080 --> 01:00:25,160
my clothing and shoes under your bed.

564
01:00:26,220 --> 01:00:29,240
My heart sunk.

565
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:32,650
Unlike other kids, you were different.

566
01:00:33,820 --> 01:00:36,470
I was also terrified.

567
01:00:37,250 --> 01:00:42,090
I avoided it because I didn't want to admit

568
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:49,500
that you, my future and my everything, were different.

569
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:55,120
Please,  please,  I hope you aren't.

570
01:00:56,840 --> 01:00:58,520
But ...

571
01:01:00,310 --> 01:01:03,200
ultimately this moment arrived.

572
01:01:06,580 --> 01:01:10,800
However, nothing is different.

573
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:16,880
I will protect you using any means.

574
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:20,580
Even if your father comes to hate you,

575
01:01:20,580 --> 01:01:25,620
I will make you the chairman of the MC empire.

576
01:01:25,620 --> 01:01:30,430
In the end you will become chairman of MC Group.

577
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:37,830
For me you will always be my proud son.

578
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:46,810
Don't let your spirit weaken.

579
01:01:46,810 --> 01:01:51,550
Power covers ten evils.

580
01:01:55,100 --> 01:01:59,400
Even if I should die,

581
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:04,200
I an going to protect you.

582
01:02:57,320 --> 01:02:59,890
Director Han has arrived.

583
01:03:14,730 --> 01:03:16,710
Chairman.

584
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:21,350
Is it true?

585
01:03:21,350 --> 01:03:23,060
Yes.

586
01:03:26,780 --> 01:03:29,930
Although I'm sure it's shocking,

587
01:03:29,930 --> 01:03:34,930
it's not grounds for disqualifying him as the manager.

588
01:03:34,930 --> 01:03:39,850
In order to prevent external disclosure, TOP will bury it.

589
01:03:39,850 --> 01:03:44,300
Don't say anything today.

590
01:03:44,300 --> 01:03:46,680
Leave.

591
01:04:04,660 --> 01:04:08,250
So far you eat every time as though you haven't eaten at all.

592
01:04:08,250 --> 01:04:12,420
Father, I don't think there are any detectives without stomach problems.

593
01:04:12,420 --> 01:04:15,520
Besides, I've been doing two jobs lately.

594
01:04:16,300 --> 01:04:21,050
I've heard.  You have helped Yoon Do a lot.

595
01:04:21,050 --> 01:04:25,060
What help?  I'm his Hyung so it's a given.

596
01:04:25,060 --> 01:04:32,030
Actually, Yoon Do has no close relatives or have a sunbae who has his back.

597
01:04:32,030 --> 01:04:36,830
He has no one.  All he has is a father.

598
01:04:37,700 --> 01:04:41,900
- But look at me. 
 - What's wrong with how you are?

599
01:04:41,960 --> 01:04:46,590
Anyway, I thank you for supporting him.

600
01:04:46,600 --> 01:04:52,600
Sincerely.  Don't change your loyalty. You're going to be blessed.

601
01:04:52,700 --> 01:04:57,600
But why do I always live like this? Good luck must dislike me only.

602
01:04:57,700 --> 01:05:00,800
Why? What's the matter with you?

603
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:03,700
- I'm here. 
 - Son,  have you eaten?

604
01:05:03,730 --> 01:05:06,190
I ate.  Hyung, you came.

605
01:05:06,190 --> 01:05:09,390
- Did you find out? 
 - Of course.

606
01:05:22,150 --> 01:05:25,790
Because I'm going to help all that I can, I had some background checks done.

607
01:05:25,790 --> 01:05:28,760
- Director Han is really something. 
 - Why?

608
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:30,850
She owns no real estate.  She has no known assets.

609
01:05:30,850 --> 01:05:33,920
As you can see, she rents where she lives.

610
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:36,760
If you believe the documents, she's worse off than me.

611
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:41,390
Then, you couldn't locate where Director Han hid the case material?

612
01:05:41,390 --> 01:05:43,470
So it seems.

613
01:05:43,500 --> 01:05:48,600
I ran so hard but came up with nothing.  I'm sorry. What could I do?

614
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:52,000
What are you sorry for? To the contrary, I'm grateful.

615
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:56,250
- What about Judge Lee Dong Joon? 
 - Hey, that guy is even more flabbergasting.

616
01:05:56,250 --> 01:05:58,930
No one could figure out where he was after retirement.

617
01:05:58,930 --> 01:06:03,120
Just in case, I checked to see if he died, but he didn't.

618
01:06:03,120 --> 01:06:08,040
But, where does he live? Where is he?  I can't confirm anything.

619
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:12,930
Jeez.  I haven't found anything.  I can't face you.

620
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:15,970
Don't say that.

621
01:06:15,970 --> 01:06:19,430
Because Hyungnim is here, I feel so reassured.

622
01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:24,400
- Even so I will keep investigating when  I can. 
 - Please do so.

623
01:06:24,450 --> 01:06:26,240
I will.

624
01:06:47,950 --> 01:06:50,600
But are you going somewhere? Are you off to work?

625
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:54,400
- Is there any reason I can't? 
 - Of course not.

626
01:06:54,440 --> 01:06:58,030
Yes.  I like seeing you standing tall.

627
01:06:58,030 --> 01:07:02,760
Mo Wan Joon is stronger that I thought.

628
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:08,310
Even if Father won't accept me, you are not the second best alternative.

629
01:07:08,310 --> 01:07:12,150
Don't waste your energy doing useless things.

630
01:07:14,860 --> 01:07:17,600
I support you.

631
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:22,770
Your brother is a movie director.  Do I seem narrow-minded?

632
01:07:22,770 --> 01:07:25,530
Kid.  You're too sensitive.

633
01:07:42,090 --> 01:07:44,850
Are you going to face it head on?

634
01:07:44,850 --> 01:07:46,770
There's no reason I can't do it.

635
01:07:46,770 --> 01:07:49,900
It doesn't change anything.

636
01:07:49,900 --> 01:07:52,910
Did you reach an agreement with Father?

637
01:07:52,910 --> 01:07:58,400
No. You didn't reach an agreement with the Chairman either, but you came to work.

638
01:07:59,750 --> 01:08:03,690
There's nothing in the world you cannot resolve.

639
01:08:03,690 --> 01:08:08,080
Last time you had a meeting with a European client on renewable energy exports.

640
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:08,920
Yes.

641
01:08:08,920 --> 01:08:12,380
I think a contract will be signed on condition that I am in charge.

642
01:08:12,380 --> 01:08:16,790
Really? I didn't expect that ...

643
01:08:16,790 --> 01:08:22,420
The client is gay. So we were able to relate better.

644
01:08:22,420 --> 01:08:28,560
It's such a profitable industry, I'm sure the major investors will be happy to learn about this.

645
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:30,780
That's good.

646
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:37,440
- Vice President. 
 - Yes?

647
01:08:37,440 --> 01:08:41,410
How about we try to enter the pink money market in this opportune moment?

648
01:08:41,410 --> 01:08:44,020
Pink money?

649
01:08:44,020 --> 01:08:49,120
If board members and shareholders can make a profit, they will throw themselves into anything, even the fires of hell.

650
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:52,100
Even if your private life comes out of the closet,

651
01:08:52,100 --> 01:08:56,370
as long as you can make money for them, their beliefs don't matter.

652
01:08:57,180 --> 01:09:01,840
I'll have a report prepared on the pink money business combined with identity issues.

653
01:09:02,860 --> 01:09:05,020
Let's start.

654
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:20,450
We have a leader with a special preference.

655
01:09:21,790 --> 01:09:24,060
That's a bit shocking.

656
01:09:24,060 --> 01:09:26,810
Is it really true?

657
01:09:26,810 --> 01:09:31,390
Can you accept it, Director?  Honestly, it's not easy for me.

658
01:09:31,390 --> 01:09:34,200
I feel the same as Team Leader Yoon.

659
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:37,400
- Lawyer Heo? 
 - Me too.

660
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:41,870
It's not an easy issue.  It could only get harder for you, Director.

661
01:09:41,870 --> 01:09:44,210
The harder an issue, the more interesting it is.

662
01:09:44,210 --> 01:09:48,680
On top of that it will be rewarding because we can help the Vice President more.

663
01:09:48,680 --> 01:09:51,850
For when the news of our leader's Achilles' heel breaks out,

664
01:09:51,850 --> 01:09:55,710
bring alternatives to what remedial action may have to be taken.

665
01:10:01,730 --> 01:10:04,580
TOP where the passion always brims over.

666
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:09,770
It's hot! It's hot! Nice to see you all.

667
01:10:09,770 --> 01:10:13,490
In any case, Director Han is fond of me these days?

668
01:10:13,490 --> 01:10:16,120
- Let's go up. 
 - Yes.

669
01:10:22,930 --> 01:10:27,120
I think at least he has a great sense of fashion.

670
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:30,510
What do you think?

671
01:10:45,720 --> 01:10:50,960
My father is even more stubborn than you thought.

672
01:10:53,060 --> 01:10:59,880
Anyway, if you keep taking care of Wan Joon,  I'm worried you are going to be very overworked.

673
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:03,750
The truth is just looking at the faces of the directors

674
01:11:03,750 --> 01:11:06,000
is stressful, and that's only the beginning.

675
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:07,800
What about  public opinion too?

676
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:14,520
They are very proficient at ripping, tearing, biting, chewing, and grinding into fine powder.

677
01:11:15,380 --> 01:11:17,590
So?

678
01:11:17,590 --> 01:11:22,780
Are you saying you will release photos of Vice-President Mo's cross dressing image to the public.

679
01:11:22,780 --> 01:11:28,590
Director Han. it's not your style to engage in groundless speculation.

680
01:11:29,480 --> 01:11:32,360
I'm really upset.

681
01:11:33,160 --> 01:11:36,260
Do you want to be the MC Group chairman?

682
01:11:39,420 --> 01:11:46,930
If I had a partner of your caliber, I don't think there would be anything for me to lose.

683
01:11:52,860 --> 01:11:58,440
Don't you have any risk, Young Master Wan Soo?

684
01:11:59,430 --> 01:12:01,260
Me?

685
01:12:02,750 --> 01:12:10,820
Someone like me, other than the fact that I drink too much,  I think I'm pretty problem-free.

686
01:12:14,050 --> 01:12:16,470
Maybe you don't agree.

687
01:12:18,050 --> 01:12:21,070
What's the title of your movie this time?

688
01:12:22,100 --> 01:12:24,760
Why?   Are you going to invest?

689
01:12:24,760 --> 01:12:29,020
If it's a good project, well, I can invest at any time.

690
01:12:29,020 --> 01:12:30,980
Really?

691
01:12:30,980 --> 01:12:37,400
The title is "What Happened in the Rainy Garden".  What do you think?

692
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:41,080
It seems interesting. Send me the script.

693
01:12:42,150 --> 01:12:44,860
I am thankful to you.

694
01:12:44,860 --> 01:12:49,280
Good luck with your task force. Well, I'll leave now.

695
01:13:01,990 --> 01:13:07,180
Oh, is that so?  Then let's meet this evening.

696
01:13:07,180 --> 01:13:08,970
Yes.

697
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:15,900
Who's this?

698
01:13:21,100 --> 01:13:23,490
Our Lawyer Heo.  Have you been very busy?

699
01:13:23,490 --> 01:13:25,400
Not at all.

700
01:13:27,480 --> 01:13:31,020
You must have had an emergency meeting today. What was the reaction?

701
01:13:31,020 --> 01:13:34,030
What reaction?

702
01:13:35,340 --> 01:13:40,200
Lawyer Heo, you're really good at saying something phony.

703
01:13:41,210 --> 01:13:47,570
Well, it's an organization's logic that even a good opinion is ignored if it differs from what they believe.

704
01:13:47,570 --> 01:13:53,380
However, our Lawyer Heo is a man who can always say "No."

705
01:13:54,760 --> 01:13:58,360
That's why I like you.

706
01:13:58,360 --> 01:14:00,350
Thank you.

707
01:14:10,190 --> 01:14:13,980
Judge Lee's wife had a history of having a rare aortic arch disease.

708
01:14:13,980 --> 01:14:18,020
She had surgery at MC Hospital the year of the murder.

709
01:14:18,020 --> 01:14:20,260
Did he join hands with MC because of his wife's surgery.

710
01:14:20,260 --> 01:14:24,030
Of course, but in the analysis of his bank deposits, there's no evidence. It's just my belief.

711
01:14:24,030 --> 01:14:26,740
After the surgery, the judge moved to Baltimore.

712
01:14:26,740 --> 01:14:30,830
But the judge and his family disappeared like ghosts to they can't be found.

713
01:14:30,830 --> 01:14:32,430
MC probably took them to the US.

714
01:14:32,430 --> 01:14:34,010
Where did they take them?

715
01:14:34,010 --> 01:14:38,800
If their destination was the airport in Baltimore, wouldn't she have gone to John Hopkins Hospital?

716
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:41,260
The world's best medical team is there.

717
01:14:41,260 --> 01:14:45,490
They might not ever return to Korea so we can't sit on our hands and just wait blindly.

718
01:14:45,490 --> 01:14:49,760
We should go and investigate. Even if we visit one house after another, we might not find anything.

719
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:52,920
Chief, are you saying you want to go to the US?

720
01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:54,380
Kid, are you kidding?

721
01:14:54,380 --> 01:14:58,360
I've been ... wanting to go to the US many times, but that's not the reason this time.

722
01:14:58,360 --> 01:15:02,260
It there is even a small change of finding something, you should go.

723
01:15:02,260 --> 01:15:06,770
Yes.  America.  Let's go.

724
01:15:08,680 --> 01:15:10,870
Let's go.

725
01:15:21,350 --> 01:15:24,700
Don't you see a possibility?

726
01:15:26,500 --> 01:15:32,100
Until now, we hung on well. In the future, we will continue to do so.

727
01:15:32,130 --> 01:15:36,640
I wish you could go to the US to find Judge Lee.

728
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:39,290
It's a shame you can't go because of TOP.

729
01:15:39,290 --> 01:15:44,530
Reporter Kim, who kept the CCTV footage for 15 years

730
01:15:44,530 --> 01:15:49,670
probably cares about this case as much as we do.

731
01:15:49,670 --> 01:15:53,440
Even if not America, whichever country he might have to go dig around,

732
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:56,930
Reporter Kim will surely find the judge.

733
01:16:04,520 --> 01:16:07,660
Good bye.   Thank you.

734
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:13,980
Welcome.

735
01:16:27,710 --> 01:16:30,300
 Dad 

736
01:16:32,660 --> 01:16:35,790
Yeah Dad.  Did something happen?

737
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:40,200
What?

738
01:16:54,920 --> 01:17:00,640
 Closed for the Day. 

739
01:17:20,030 --> 01:17:26,950

 Graceful Family Preview 

745
01:17:54,440 --> 01:17:56,120
I found the report.

746
01:17:56,120 --> 01:17:59,410
Director Han, Joo Young Il, we have to find proof they have a special relationship.

747
01:17:59,410 --> 01:18:01,810
Oh, Director, I heard Judge Lee arrived in Korea.

748
01:18:01,810 --> 01:18:04,240
They want to put Judge Lee on the witness stand?

749
01:18:04,240 --> 01:18:06,230
I hear he goes in and out of TOP.

750
01:18:06,230 --> 01:18:09,010
Please be Wan Soo's right hand.

751
01:18:09,010 --> 01:18:12,600
 Park Tae Ho. Heo Yoon Do, was Park Tae Ho? 

752
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:17,970
15 years ago, you got paid by MC and sent an innocent person to jail.

753
01:18:17,970 --> 01:18:19,580
 What I want is simple... 

754
01:18:19,580 --> 01:18:22,770
Let's lock up Director Han.
