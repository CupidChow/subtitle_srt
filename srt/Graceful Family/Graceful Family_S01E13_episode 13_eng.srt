 Graceful Family 

6
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:37,390
 I can’t even remember the last time we had a conversation. 

7
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:43,550
 I’m thinking about going to Italy for my project. 

8
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:46,970
 Do as you please. 

9
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:50,380
 You seem to be pushing yourself very hard these days 

10
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:53,820
 How about coming with me as a vacation? 

11
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:57,960
 You know I don’t have time for leisure. 

12
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:10,380
 Director, someone is here to see you. 

13
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:39,600
 Wan Joon, Wan Soo, this is your father's house. 

14
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:43,340
 It’s so huge! 

15
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:03,000
 To a childless couple, one day, a new family appeared like an army of occupation. 

16
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,200
 It was the moment the tumultuous first act of MC Group's family began. 

17
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:17,420
 Arriving thoughtlessly without telling me anything, what are you trying to do? 

18
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:22,880
 Look here, Nurse Ha.  You're mistaken. 

19
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:27,260
 This doesn't justify your affair. 

20
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:31,900
 Our Wan Su and Wan Joon  are children without a father listed in the family register. 

21
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:36,460
  Wan Soo is starting elementary school now. 

22
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:43,320
 Do you want the sons of the Mo family branded as illegitimate children for their entire lives? 

23
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:52,900
 Acknowledge it! That you have ended the Mo family lineage. 

24
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:11,710
 The instinct of a father who cannot turned away from his lineage. 

25
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:17,410
 Through the loss of the wife who was stabbed in her most sensitive place. 

26
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:22,860
 The woman who seamlessly became the mistress of the MC family. 

27
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:26,510
 You said you're Housekeeper Jeong? 

28
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:28,040
 Yes. 

29
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:31,470
 Now the madame you used to serve is gone. 

30
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:35,500
 Starting now, I am the madame of this household. 

31
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,410
 You have to line yourself up well. 

32
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:42,910
 Starting today, it's a given you will be loyal to me. 

33
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,900
 Report to me the movements of Ahn Jae Rim and father-in-law in detail to me. 

34
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:58,130
 Unless you want to be fired this instant. 

35
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:05,670
 I will. 

36
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:08,920
 Leave. 

37
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:23,990
 The ambition  of the woman who transformed herself from the Chairman's nurse to lady of the house 

38
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:28,160
 did not end with her just becoming the madame. 

39
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:37,430
 Mom, try it. Try it, Mom. 

40
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:40,270
 Young Master. 

41
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:44,000
 Try some! 

42
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:06,960
 The ambition blazed up to control MC Group through the perfect son. 

43
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:18,800
 Graceful Family

48
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,980
We've deposited 5 million won in Lawyer Heo's account by hacking his phone.

49
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:48,300
We downloaded everything from his desktop, laptop, and phone and added destruction of evidence as an additional charge.

50
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:54,700
Okay.  But looking at your expressions, I think everyone has a lot to say.

51
00:05:54,700 --> 00:06:00,600
You favored Lawyer Heo... I was curious about the reason.

52
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,320
I also feel the same.

53
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:06,320
From the beginning, I've felt something leery about  Lawyer Heo.

54
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:11,530
No exceptions are made for anyone who is an impediment to our MC Group.  That is our rule.

55
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:16,290
But right now, Lawyer Heo's personal background threatens our organization.

56
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:25,030
Fifteen years ago Miss Mo Seok Hui's mother was murdered.

57
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:29,150
I had to resolve it because the case involved the MC family.

58
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:33,300
Back then, it was the way to save MC Group.

59
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:39,760
The reason why MC Group has to be alive and well?  It's the reason for our existence!

60
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,960
Have I ever dared to use TOP for my own personal gain?

61
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,500
No.

62
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,590
I think that's a sufficient answer.

63
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:56,400
Miss Seok Hui is coming in.

64
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,530
I think Director Han should brief me as to why Lawyer Heo is absent.

65
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:11,930
Of course.   You deserve to find out.

66
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,020
Everyone, please leave.

67
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:30,210
 TOP MC Group Security Agent 

68
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:36,540
Lawyer Heo was arrested.  Under what pretext?

69
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:38,940
It's embezzlement of government funds.

70
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:43,430
Make Lawyer Heo give up trying to get a retrial.

71
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:51,300
Miss.  Irrespective of what you might say, you are an MC group's person.

72
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:54,930
While your mother's death is a pity, it's already the past.

73
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:59,280
Obstructting  MC Group's future over that incident isn't something you should be doing.

74
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:03,370
I know it is the past for MC, but for me, it is still currently in progress.

75
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:08,200
Even if it obstructs MC's future, it is my task which I must do.

76
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,980
That business could re-open wounds.

77
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:15,990
Why?  Because the culprit of the murder case is a member of the MC family?

78
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,580
I guess you have something that makes you suspect your family?

79
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:24,760
Whatever.

80
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:27,970
It's a fact that your mother and you being involved

81
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:30,950
damages MC Group.

82
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:34,710
But why do I keep hearing that to mean

83
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:39,590
that you and MC covered up the murder case?

84
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:45,370
Lawyer Heo is a good lawyer.

85
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:48,500
However, with his hands and feet bound, he is useless.

86
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,580
Do you think you can get a a lawyer who will tackle a retrial?

87
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:54,180
Even if a brave lawyer steps forward ...

88
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:57,860
You know it won't be possible to see it to the end.

89
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:59,590
So what?

90
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:05,610
I'll repeat once more. Lawyer Heo should quit trying to get a retrial.

91
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:12,500
- If he quits? 
 - If he quits, he can return to his normal life.

92
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:19,680
That'a  a very sweet temptation.

93
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:24,850
But do you know what  the signature characteristic of your modus operandi is?

94
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:29,670
You corner someone into the worst case scenario and tell them to get back at least the minimum.

95
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:35,300
At first glance it seems sweet, but it's actually ruthless.

96
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:50,410
Lawyer Heo's prison life will be extremely difficult and dangeroous.

97
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:56,500
- You might hurt him? 
 - Prison is not a place to stay for a long time.

98
00:09:56,500 --> 00:10:02,100
Everything won't go the way you want. No matter how competent you are.

99
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:06,700
Even if the plan changes, the results don't. In my case.

100
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,720
Will it be?

101
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,880
Miss, this is no time for a leisurely debate.

102
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:17,040
You have to rescue Lawyer Heo, and you have a lot on your plate.

103
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:21,920
Let me give you a tip.  Your hands and feet have been cut off now.

104
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,710
You'll need to take care of that first.

105
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,820
Remember only that TOP is always ... more than you could imagine.

106
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:06,760
What did you say?  Traffic department?

107
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:10,570
But Chief, why Traffic all of sudden?

108
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:13,480
It's like getting struck by lightening in the middle of the night! How can you do this?

109
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,130
I don't know either.  It's an order from a higher up.

110
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:17,160
- A higher up?  Who?

111
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:20,970
I don't know! I told you I really don't know!

112
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:22,720
Chief ...

113
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:30,930
  Wife  

114
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:38,000
Yes, Dear.  What?  Search and seizure?

115
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,320
Chief, your junior's visuals are not a joke.

116
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,790
When that kid was young, he was a thug.

117
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:47,790
Really?  But how did a thug turn over a new leaf as a farmer?

118
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:50,050
Whatever you may take me for, I've changed a lot of people.

119
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:51,570
Really?

120
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:01,360
Chief... what's all this?

121
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,800
What do you mean? TOP is fighting back.

122
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:14,490
Good bye.  Good bye.

123
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:20,220
It's closed for today.

124
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:22,380
This is a search and seizure warrant for the home of Attorney Heo Yoon Do

125
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:24,430
who was arrested for embezzlement of government funds.

126
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:26,590
Hurry up and start!

127
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:33,230
What is this bullshit?

128
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:38,700
My son embezzled government funds? You guys are crazy, crazy.

129
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:42,620
If my son embezzled, I am the grim reaper!

130
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:46,000
Are you spewing words or farts?! Stop it right now!

131
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,960
What the heck are you people doing!

132
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,170
What are you doing?

133
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:54,330
Two of you search the kitchen!

134
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:56,210
Yes, sir.

135
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:58,730
Search well.

136
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:01,280
What shock is this all of a sudden?

137
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:05,960
The heavens and the earth and everyone in the world knows what kind of son my son is

138
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:09,920
and you're telling me that he embezzled government funds.

139
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:14,360
You bastards are dying to be punished by the heavens!

140
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,700
What kind of shock is this?

141
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:22,640
Yoon Do! Bring me my son, you thieves!

142
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:25,920
I'm telling you to bring me my son!

143
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,580
Yoon Do!

144
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:37,340
You bastards!

145
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:53,410
Are the prosecutors allowed to act this way?

146
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:58,230
PCs, laptops, and even my camera! They even took my camera!

147
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:01,830
No, this must have been TOP's doing.

148
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:04,020
What are we going to do now?

149
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:07,720
Seok Hui, my home is a mess because of the search and seizure right now, too.

150
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:12,490
My wife and children were in shock, so I've sent them away to her family's house.

151
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:15,090
And after that I was assigned to the Traffic Department out of the blue.

152
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:19,410
TOP has sent us a warning that they are going to bind our hands and feet.

153
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:21,560
What can we do in this condition?

154
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:25,980
We began all of this with good intentions but if they are going to mess with our families,

155
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:29,160
truthfully I'm a little scared.

156
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:33,170
That Director Han is a truly terrifying woman.

157
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:38,040
Even if the earth is destroyed, she's the type of woman who would survive it, even if that meant moving to another planet.

158
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:41,790
Does this make sense in the 21st century?

159
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:44,750
This is ridiculous...

160
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,350
All because of our issues...

161
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,070
I'm so sad and apologetic to you all.

162
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:55,430
Don't be apologetic, it's not your fault.

163
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,310
News Patch is probably going to have to close its doors.

164
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:02,030
I might lose my job.

165
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:08,090
 Remember only that TOP is always ... more than you could imagine. 

166
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,640
We are not open.

167
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:39,050
Are you Heo Jang Soo?

168
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,830
Who are you?

169
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:46,520
I'm Han Je Gook.

170
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:51,290
Han Je Gook?

171
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:59,280
I'm going to get straight to the point.

172
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:03,900
Make Lawyer Heo give up the retrial.

173
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:10,820
If your son gives up on the retrial, I will get him released.

174
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:17,790
Did you lock my son up?

175
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:24,820
You shouldn't lock up an innocent person and then threaten them.

176
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:32,040
You seem like an educated and sophisticated person,

177
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:35,120
why are you doing this kind of thing?

178
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,790
Lawyer Heo put in so much work to become a lawyer.

179
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:42,620
If he becomes disbarred and gets a criminal record,

180
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:46,430
it will be a big scar on your heart forever.

181
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:53,660
You can change your son's mind, can't you?

182
00:16:56,130 --> 00:17:01,610
If he gives up on the retrial, everything can go back to the way it was.

183
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:10,280
Your decision can save your son.

184
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:16,410
Father?

185
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:24,380
Did you also send my Yoon Do's mother to prison?

186
00:17:27,090 --> 00:17:29,580
I don't want to.

187
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:35,840
Since he was a little boy, my Yoon Do's world has been collapsing

188
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:39,630
because his mother has been falsely imprisoned for 15 years.

189
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:44,550
He's saying that he's going to finally fix that now.

190
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:47,400
How can I as his father stop him?

191
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:52,790
I may not have any power or support

192
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:56,610
and I may not have anything,

193
00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:59,630
but I'm not going to live like that.

194
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:02,600
No matter how ugly this world is,

195
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:08,040
my innocent Yoon Do won't be going to prison.

196
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:13,730
You only believe that he's innocent but you have no proof.

197
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:22,450
There are some people in this world who are always fated to lose.

198
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,420
Wait a minute!

199
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:57,440
You're right! I've always lost throughout my life!

200
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:04,050
Do you fabricate crimes and frame innocent people

201
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:06,640
because you always win in life?

202
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,540
Who do you think you are? Who do you think you are

203
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:14,060
that you can treat my innocent son like a criminal and look down on him?

204
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:16,530
Who do you think you are!

205
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:23,710
There's no way your son will return home.

206
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:28,240
If you have lots of money and education, you live like that?

207
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:34,710
I'm fine even though I'm uneducated and poor! Do you know why?

208
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:41,140
It's because I'm not going to live filthily like you guys.

209
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:34,150
Miss Seok Hui...

210
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:38,700
I'm really afraid.

211
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:44,420
What do I do if I really cannot see my Yoon Do anymore?

212
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:54,340
You don't think that my Yoon Do will blame me, do you?

213
00:20:57,530 --> 00:21:00,920
My son is falsely imprisoned.

214
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:05,010
It wouldn't have been enough to beg the person who said she would get release him

215
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:08,000
but I poured water on her.

216
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,160
What am I going to do if Yoon Do really goes to prison?

217
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:19,330
I'm afraid of being a father who ruins his innocent son's life.

218
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:24,400
What if Yoon Do...

219
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:27,000
What if

220
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:31,860
he hates me?

221
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:37,560
Father, you didn't raise Lawyer Heo that way.

222
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:40,870
He will be proud of you instead.

223
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:48,180
What am I going to do if my Yoon Do really goes to prison?

224
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:52,560
No. That will never happen!

225
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:55,070
I will definitely...

226
00:21:56,100 --> 00:22:01,600
I will definitely make sure that he gets out.

227
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:05,390
Miss Seok Hui,

228
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:10,820
Please... please save him.

229
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:17,610
At least, since you were born as a rich chaebol,

230
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:21,130
you can get him released.

231
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:24,130
Please save him,

232
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:28,560
I will make sure to pay you back.

233
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:32,730
Please save him.

234
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:45,640
I will definitely get Lawyer Heo out.

235
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:09,390
I knew we would see each other again someday.

236
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,320
This is somewhat more of a dramatic turn of events than I anticipated.

237
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:20,360
We're going to be together for a long time so we might as well take it easy.

238
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:23,670
What kind of coffee do you want?

239
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:31,040
- American style. 
 - American?

240
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:45,690
Who's this? What's the amazing Mo Seok Hui doing here?

241
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:47,440
Where's Lawyer Heo?

242
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,680
Are you two playing hide and seek?

243
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:55,480
Mo Seok Hui and her lawyer are taking turns going in and out as suspects.

244
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:59,000
I know. It's not like the Prosecutor's office is some kind of playground.

245
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,540
You keep inviting innocent people in turn.

246
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:06,150
I can't tell if you're bored or stupid.

247
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:08,000
I'd better see Lawyer Heo.

248
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:13,560
I should let you see him since we don't have an ordinary relationship.

249
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,510
Your upgraded manner is good.

250
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:39,420
Are you okay?

251
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,020
I'm okay.

252
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:44,400
I didn't even think about the chance you'd get arrested.

253
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:49,420
It's all due to my negligence. I should have expected at least this much.

254
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:54,410
It's my mistake for thinking that I knew Director Han and TOP well. I was too complacent.

255
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:58,960
If you expected it? Then you would have been arrested knowing it was going to happen.

256
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,710
This is not anyone's negligence.

257
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:08,910
I'm sorry that I caused everything to end up this way.

258
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:13,500
We don't even have the time to blame ourselves right now.

259
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:16,460
Now, it's an all-out war for them and for us.

260
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:22,430
You're right. They hacked my phone and laptop to deposit this money. There's no way to get out of that.

261
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:28,520
The only evidence is that I have no motive to embezzle, but that's difficult to prove.

262
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:31,450
- I'll start by hiring a lawyer. 
 - It won't be easy.

263
00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:34,450
There's no lawyer who will want to catch Director Han's eye.

264
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:38,360
For now, I'll try the best to defend myself with a public defender.

265
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:43,880
Director Han says she'll go easy on you if you give up on the retrial.

266
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,740
It's Director Han's philosophy that you can't show mercy to traitors.

267
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:51,790
From Director Han's perspective I'm a traitor.

268
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:54,950
The moment I make a deal with her, I'm going to prison.

269
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:57,220
That's Director Han's way.

270
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,970
In any case, they need to make a decision within 48 hours

271
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:07,050
of whether they are going to let me go or keep me in custody.

272
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:10,280
We have only one option.

273
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:12,850
The arrest warrant must have come from Joo Hyeong Il,

274
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:16,170
so the discharge can only come from him.

275
00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:18,530
Joo Hyeong Il...

276
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:23,520
Right now, he's the only alternative.

277
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:27,010
I'll have to try.

278
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:38,390
When I was in jail, my fate was in your hands.

279
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:42,920
Is my fate now in your hands?

280
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:53,280
I think my father is probably very worried. Can you help him?

281
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:57,450
Your father is a much stronger person

282
00:26:57,450 --> 00:27:01,180
than you know. And he's a cool person.

283
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:05,330
Something hasn't happened to my father, has it?

284
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,690
There's nothing.

285
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:19,710
 Seok Hui, please save him. 

286
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:22,980
 You can get him out, can't you? 

287
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:26,770
 I'll make sure to pay you back. 

288
00:27:27,370 --> 00:27:31,440
 Please save him. 

289
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:43,340
I'm definitely getting you out.

290
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:48,230
I feel supported since I have you by my side.

291
00:27:58,050 --> 00:28:00,600

Seeing as how I've found your regular spot, I'm almost a reporter, too.

308
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:21,690
Reporter Kim,

309
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:28,440
Lawyer Heo asked me to confirm with you what the two of you talked about while joining forces.

310
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:36,530
 It's an impossible task. Why haven't you given it up till now? 

311
00:29:36,530 --> 00:29:38,760
 Curiosity? Obsession? 

312
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:42,220
 Maybe it's my natural stubbornness or my ambition as a reporter? 

313
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:47,220
 Why don't you add one more thing to that list? 

314
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:50,240
 Justice. 

315
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:55,020
Justice. He told me to add Justice to my list of reasons.

316
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:17,980
 Speed enforcement in progress. 

317
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,070
Lawyer Heo said that the one thing you told him in the past

318
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:53,550
has been a big help to getting him here.

319
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:00,790
 Hyung, you should take also care of this issue and get a promotion. 

320
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:06,020
 Is my promotion important here? Your mother's life and yours are at stake right now. 

321
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:16,000
♫  Chocolate is sweet, it's sweet.  ♫

322
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:22,680
I'm hungry. I'm hungry.

323
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:30,740
Ah, why are my insides still so empty no matter how much I eat?

324
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:34,320
What am I supposed to do?

325
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,920
I have to stop eating bread.

326
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:47,580
You're Lawyer Heo's friend.

327
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:51,390
 That's right, I'm Tae Ho. Honor student, Oh Gwang Mi. 

328
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:53,530
 It's nice to see you friend. 

329
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:58,370
 My mom is in jail after being framed a murderer. 

330
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:08,340
Why don't you fill your empty insides with your friendship with Lawyer Heo?

331
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:22,890
♫   I'm on fire, I'm on fire   ♫

332
00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:27,250
I want to get Lawyer Heo out within 48 hours.

333
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:32,590
I know that not only will that put me in danger but all of you as well.

334
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:41,610
  Voice Memo ' 

335
00:32:41,610 --> 00:32:46,760
 Director Han ordered me to give the Chairman the sauce with the bitter almond 

336
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:50,690
 and send her a text when the dinner was over. 

337
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:55,160
 I had no idea that 

338
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:57,650
 the Chairman would pass away like that, Miss. 

339
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:06,590
- What is that? 
 -  This is circumstantial evidence that Director Han tried to kill my grandfather.

340
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:08,850
 Give me your cell phone. 

341
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:14,340
 Are you going to take the fall for my grandfather's murder? 

342
00:33:15,810 --> 00:33:20,680
  If you don't hand it over, I won't take responsibility for what happens later. 

343
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:36,960
 Also, one more thing. 

344
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:40,020
 The meal is almost over.  

345
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:46,990
I'm of course going to get Lawyer Heo out but I'm also not going to give up on getting Director Han.

346
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:53,840
But I need everyone's help.

347
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:59,570
If we can't get Lawyer Heo out, we won't be able to proceed with the retrial. We need to get him out first.

348
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:02,980
I'll use my vacation days to deal with my Traffic Department transfer for now.

349
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:08,660
The evidence against embezzlement is indisputable since it was done through phone hacking. How can we get him out?

350
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:11,080
Lawyer Heo's arrest is the joint work of both Director Han and Joo Hyeong Il.

351
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:15,350
We need to grab Joo Hyeong Il by the collar and make a deal for him to release Lawyer Heo.

352
00:34:16,450 --> 00:34:19,610
Lawyer Heo said the same thing.

353
00:34:19,610 --> 00:34:24,420
According to the investigative report, there's no CCTV footage in the record. This must be an omission of evidence.

354
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:27,400
An omission of evidence might cause embarrassment but it doesn't prove guilt.

355
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,140
If he insists, there's nothing you can say.

356
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:32,650
That's why prosecutor bastards habitually make omissions.

357
00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:37,180
Then what about if you have proof that there was an intentional omission of existing CCTV footage?

358
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:40,490
That's destruction of evidence with a maximum sentence of 5 years.

359
00:34:40,490 --> 00:34:43,530
Isn't there any way to get that proof?

360
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:49,880
What about if the police handed it over but Chief Prosecutor Joo omitted it?

361
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:53,710
Yoon Do and I searched all over for it but we couldn't find the police records.

362
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:56,520
I thought they must have hidden it because they felt guilty about something.

363
00:34:56,520 --> 00:35:00,600
Dirty people always prepare an escape for them to get away.

364
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:05,350
When TOP had the prosecution by the collar, why wouldn't the police take the bribe?

365
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:07,740
What if we meet the supervising police officer from that time?

366
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:11,420
Oh, Chief, you should know who it is since you investigated it.

367
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:14,410
Park Jin Sook, that xx bastard.

368
00:35:14,410 --> 00:35:15,910
Do you remember even that bastard's name?

369
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:19,790
If you see that bastard's face, you'll see that it's face to remember.

370
00:35:19,790 --> 00:35:22,700
To sum it up, he's a criminal wearing the mask of a detective.

371
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:25,120
Just thinking about him makes me want to vomit.

372
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:30,170
What can we do about it? The other side keeps using their power and strength.

373
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:33,940
We have no choice but to run around whether it's the mud or not.

374
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:37,080
If there's even a 0.1% chance, we need to do anything we can.

375
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,850
I can't make any guarantees.

376
00:35:38,850 --> 00:35:44,290
I don't know if that bastard has anything or even if he has something if he'll hand it over to us.

377
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:49,510
Stop looking at me with hopeful eyes.

378
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:52,390
I haven't seen him in 3 years.

379
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:56,900
Detective Oh, please find out where his jurisdiction is.

380
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:58,260
I will.

381
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:01,110
And I'll find an alternative way to tie Director Han to it.

382
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:04,610
We only have 48 hours. Don't even breathe. ( Don't waste time. )

383
00:36:04,610 --> 00:36:06,300
Okay.

384
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:11,020
What are you guys doing? Let's do it together.

385
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:21,430
- Let's go! 
 - Let's go!

386
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:32,430
 Let's use your family members' psychology. 

387
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:36,540
 Who would benefit the most from Director Han disappearing? 

388
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:48,520
- Yes? Aigoo! 
 - Oppa?

389
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:53,160
Our Seok Hui coming by to this shabby place? Sit down!

390
00:36:58,130 --> 00:37:00,080
Do you have any business with me?

391
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:05,210
Oppa, what do you think of Director Han?

392
00:37:05,210 --> 00:37:07,160
Why are you asking me about Director Han all of a sudden?

393
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:12,250
Oppa, you have plenty of qualitifcation to being the successor.

394
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:16,500
You can just learn any business skill you are lacking going forward

395
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:19,990
and you could just get a smart adviser and be the figure head.

396
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:23,530
I'm not saying that you're lacking.

397
00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:27,300
I'm just saying that you have the handicap of being an artist.

398
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:35,870
Truthfully, isn't this the best time for you to become the successor?

399
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:38,970
Father is pushing for you.

400
00:37:38,970 --> 00:37:40,850
Well... that's true.

401
00:37:40,850 --> 00:37:46,300
For many reasons, I prefer you being the successor over Mo Wan Joon.

402
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:49,040
And you told me that you'd take care of me too.

403
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,440
I'm being genuine about that.

404
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:54,880
Oppa, be the successor.

405
00:37:58,490 --> 00:38:02,090
But the problem is, of course, Director Han.

406
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:06,840
Director Han is the biggest obstacle to you being the successor.

407
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,550
So?

408
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:12,030
I want to send Director Han away.

409
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:18,010
You have grandiose ambitions!

410
00:38:18,010 --> 00:38:20,060
Do you want to join up?

411
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:24,890
So, you're telling me that we should send Director Han far away?

412
00:38:24,890 --> 00:38:28,510
Truthfully, from grandfather to father to us,

413
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:32,030
why should should three generations of our household be under Director Han's control?

414
00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:35,270
This is about our family's pride.

415
00:38:37,070 --> 00:38:43,400
It's not a bad suggestion but there's some risk involved.

416
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:52,170
Well.  If you agree to it, I have my own plan to get rid of Director Han.

417
00:38:52,170 --> 00:38:55,190
If you make your decision, let me know.

418
00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:56,750
Okay.

419
00:38:56,750 --> 00:39:00,110
But I can't wait for too long.

420
00:39:00,110 --> 00:39:02,760
You know me. I'm impatient.

421
00:39:14,690 --> 00:39:17,610
 I want to send Director Han away. 

422
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:26,790
The shares that Mo Seok Hui got from the Chairman is 31.6%.

423
00:39:26,790 --> 00:39:31,590
Vice President Mo Wan Joon has 31.3% which Chairman gave.

424
00:39:31,590 --> 00:39:33,220
It's just a 0.2% difference.

425
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:38,140
At this rate, isn't it an easy solution of convincing a few board members and making a purchase?

426
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:41,630
In return, it'll get noisy.

427
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:45,470
Then what if we adjust Master Mo Wan Soo's percentage?

428
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:48,780
We take Master Mo Wan Soo's shares?

429
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:55,390
Aigoo! I feel like I come here more often than going to the film company!

430
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:02,860
But I don't see my favorite Lawyer Heo here.

431
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:04,160
He's working outside the office.

432
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,820
Oh, so he's working outside.

433
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:08,370
- Let's go up. 
 - Okay.

434
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:12,430
I saw it already. 10%.

435
00:40:19,290 --> 00:40:24,260
Director Han, I saw some unfortunate statistics that said

436
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:27,740
that most of the useful and meaningful accomplishments in this world

437
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:30,890
are made by people between the ages of 25 and 50.

438
00:40:30,890 --> 00:40:34,080
That's a really unfortunate statistic, isn't it?

439
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:39,510
I'm reaching 40 soon, and I haven't accomplished anything yet.

440
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:41,200
Statistics are just statistics.

441
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,600
Is that so?

442
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:46,240
You are at an age where you still have lots of opportunity to accomplish something.

443
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:49,720
Wow, do you really feel that way?

444
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:51,450
Of course.

445
00:40:52,670 --> 00:40:57,580
Of course, if I have your support it's a possibility.

446
00:40:57,580 --> 00:41:02,120
If everyone does their own work in their own field, then accomplishments will certainly come one day.

447
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:04,570
Vice President Mo Wan Joon in his Vice President role

448
00:41:04,570 --> 00:41:08,110
and you in your film director role.

449
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:18,110
So, you're telling me to shut my mouth and make my movies.

450
00:41:18,110 --> 00:41:23,180
But what should I do? I want to do business.

451
00:41:24,770 --> 00:41:28,090
You've had varied experiences up till now.

452
00:41:28,090 --> 00:41:31,060
You are suited to being a film director.

453
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:33,660
You should make some meaningful accomplishments as a film director

454
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:37,620
before it's too late. You're almost 40 after all.

455
00:41:38,930 --> 00:41:40,690
Isn't that right?

456
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:48,450
But Director Han. Do you think you'll be able to overrule my father's mind?

457
00:41:48,450 --> 00:41:50,780
Chairman is a wise person.

458
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:56,080
In the end, whatever judgement or decision he makes will be for the good of MC group.

459
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:02,290
Ah, our Director Han is really stubborn.

460
00:42:02,290 --> 00:42:04,450
It's not stubbornness but conviction.

461
00:42:04,450 --> 00:42:11,480
Director Han, don't you know that there's always a hidden trap in conviction?

462
00:42:36,790 --> 00:42:39,550
Where are you?

463
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:53,930
Did you agree to join up?

464
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:56,890
But, Seok Hui...

465
00:42:56,890 --> 00:43:02,640
If you want to get rid of Director Han, don't you have to have a faultless plan?

466
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:04,940
I know.

467
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:07,450
Then what's your plan?

468
00:43:07,450 --> 00:43:10,330
I'm working on Chief Prosecutor Joo Hyeong Il.

469
00:43:10,330 --> 00:43:13,230
What? How?

470
00:43:13,230 --> 00:43:16,160
You know that I went on a matchmaking date with Chief Prosecutor Joo's son.

471
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:21,570
I know. You made a mess there and ended up going to jail.

472
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:23,900
- I did. 
 - But?

473
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:27,130
I approached them saying I was thinking about marriage again.

474
00:43:27,870 --> 00:43:30,110
If I become the daughter-in-law of the Chief Prosecutor Joo,

475
00:43:30,110 --> 00:43:34,110
then wouldn't they want a daughter-in-law with a lot of shares?

476
00:43:34,110 --> 00:43:36,080
So?

477
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:39,690
I told them that if they want a rich daughter-in-law then they need to get rid of Director Han.

478
00:43:39,690 --> 00:43:41,660
Wow.

479
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:44,220
- But in return-- 
 - In return?

480
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:47,520
You need to persuade father.

481
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,170
I do?

482
00:43:50,450 --> 00:43:52,600
Why do I need to?

483
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:57,790
We need to know exactly what father's intentions are so there's no further trouble after the revolution.

484
00:43:57,790 --> 00:43:59,790
When father still has lingering attachments to Director Han,

485
00:43:59,790 --> 00:44:02,780
we got rid of her first?

486
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:05,660
What do we do if there's a backlash?

487
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:09,940
Ah, this kid... How can you be this smart?

488
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:13,340
When you're even pretty?

489
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:17,150
My brain cells tend to be pretty active.

490
00:44:18,630 --> 00:44:23,880
Oppa, you have to check father's suspicious nature first.

491
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:27,810
Okay. Don't worry about that.

492
00:44:27,810 --> 00:44:31,950
But... how are you going to send Director Han away?

493
00:44:31,950 --> 00:44:35,650
It's no fun watching when you know.

494
00:44:35,650 --> 00:44:38,480
You're a little... cool.

495
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:40,540
You just found out?

496
00:45:02,910 --> 00:45:06,500
Are you allowed to get on the golf course with that form?

497
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:08,500
I guess they let anyone on the golf course these days.

498
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:12,530
Who do we have here? You're Reporter Kim who chases around celebrities' butt holes, is it not?

499
00:45:12,530 --> 00:45:14,960
Your neck is going to break. How much gold are you wearing?

500
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:17,210
Should I try chasing after a detective's butt hole from now on?

501
00:45:17,210 --> 00:45:20,210
Go easy on him. We're the ones who have a need.

502
00:45:20,210 --> 00:45:22,470
Oh, that's right.

503
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:23,740
Let's have some tea.

504
00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:28,100
Me? I don't do face-to-face with people whose faces are full of errors.

505
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:31,810
Well, leave the police force over corruption then.

506
00:45:37,010 --> 00:45:40,780
I've been serving the people for 30 years.

507
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:44,860
How can you use such a nasty word like corruption?

508
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:47,050
You look young for your age, Sunbae-nim.

509
00:45:47,050 --> 00:45:50,390
It's plain to see what department you work in.

510
00:45:50,390 --> 00:45:54,540
It shows up on your face. If you move over to Gangnam, you don't get old. Like me.

511
00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:57,620
You remember the housekeeper murder incident from 15 years ago, don't you?

512
00:45:57,620 --> 00:46:01,040
I've worked on more than a case or two, you know?

513
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:03,840
But, why are you bringing up the past?

514
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:06,060
There's an internal investigation going on.

515
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:07,670
You're in charge?

516
00:46:07,670 --> 00:46:09,170
Yes.

517
00:46:11,050 --> 00:46:14,850
But... why are you doing an internal investigation of a case that's over with?

518
00:46:14,850 --> 00:46:17,500
We keep getting anonymous letters that we don't have the real culprit.

519
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:19,240
Really?

520
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:23,570
You've been eating well, wearing well, and pooping well all this time while getting kickback.

521
00:46:23,570 --> 00:46:28,580
What to do? Looks like you're going into solitary confinement this time!

522
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:31,050
- What? 
 - Police files were destroyed and gone, too.

523
00:46:31,050 --> 00:46:33,920
That's because the higher ups ordered it.

524
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:39,850
This case is being internally investigated over police files, but the CCTV footage is missing.

525
00:46:39,850 --> 00:46:42,520
CCTV footage is fundamental when it comes to investigations.

526
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:44,630
Where did you put it away?

527
00:46:44,630 --> 00:46:46,610
What are you talking about?

528
00:46:46,610 --> 00:46:48,300
We handed over the CCTV  footage to them!

529
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:50,830
If it's gone, the prosecution must have taken it out!

530
00:46:50,830 --> 00:46:52,830
It's not us. You got the wrong person.

531
00:46:52,830 --> 00:46:55,850
- Do you have proof? 
 - Well, that's--

532
00:46:55,850 --> 00:47:00,860
If you don't have proof, you're going to be put in a very tough spot, Detective Park Jin Soo.

533
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:04,160
People who don't mind injustice but can't stand disadvantage...

534
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:07,010
That's why the detectives who take bribes

535
00:47:07,010 --> 00:47:10,310
always keep an escape route...

536
00:47:12,630 --> 00:47:16,760
Th- that's true, but it's been so long.

537
00:47:17,490 --> 00:47:20,950
But... are you saying that's me?!

538
00:47:20,950 --> 00:47:24,210
Sunbae-nim, it's serious.

539
00:47:24,210 --> 00:47:27,880
Internal investigation incident is going to explode soon.

540
00:47:30,230 --> 00:47:35,060
Wow... this box is a breeding ground for corruption.

541
00:47:35,780 --> 00:47:39,110
It means deals were made over all these cases.

542
00:47:39,110 --> 00:47:43,380
Wow. As a fellow police officer, this is embarrassing.

543
00:47:45,510 --> 00:47:47,250
There's a case from 20 years ago, too.

544
00:47:47,250 --> 00:47:49,710
Oh, then there's a possibility.

545
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:56,450
 Ahn Jae Rim Murder Case 
 Investigation Materials 

546
00:48:00,670 --> 00:48:04,650
Lawyer Heo is lucky...

547
00:48:05,770 --> 00:48:07,560
What is it?

548
00:48:26,890 --> 00:48:29,670
 Eldest Master is entering. 

549
00:48:34,460 --> 00:48:35,690
What is it?

550
00:48:35,690 --> 00:48:39,480
Father, I heard something really interesting today.

551
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:40,680
What about?

552
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:44,830
Director Han seems to be moving up Mo Wan Joon's successorship.

553
00:48:44,830 --> 00:48:45,870
What?

554
00:48:45,870 --> 00:48:50,930
This is coming out of TOP, so the info is probably correct.

555
00:48:52,730 --> 00:48:58,540
Seriously, at this rate, isn't this going to Director Han's head too much?

556
00:48:58,540 --> 00:49:02,690
Well, there's nothing lacking when it comes to her abilities or loyalty.

557
00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:08,540
But Father, if you think about it, she works for MC Group,

558
00:49:08,540 --> 00:49:12,430
not for our family, no?

559
00:49:12,430 --> 00:49:16,360
Director Han won't betray MC Group,

560
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:20,150
but it means she can throw our family away at a moment's notice.

561
00:49:20,150 --> 00:49:24,590
If not, how could she ignore your decision like this?

562
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:28,580
You're the head of MC Group,

563
00:49:28,580 --> 00:49:31,560
so why are you getting dragged around like this?

564
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:33,520
Well, I heard it was no different for Grandfather,

565
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:36,960
but... what is the result of that right now?

566
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:38,710
That's enough.

567
00:49:41,090 --> 00:49:45,830
So... what are you thinking?

568
00:49:45,830 --> 00:49:50,320
You can't throw away a car because the brake is broken...

569
00:49:52,650 --> 00:49:55,190
You have to change the brake.

570
00:49:56,450 --> 00:49:59,270
Before the car gets damaged further.

571
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:07,000
You can leave now.

572
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,420
Yes, okay.

573
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:24,160
Yes?

574
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:29,390
Seok Hui. Seok... Oh!

575
00:50:30,290 --> 00:50:33,960
Father is thinking about his next move.

576
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:35,690
Really?

577
00:50:35,690 --> 00:50:39,780
Asking for my opinion when I'm dissing Director Han means

578
00:50:39,780 --> 00:50:43,770
he's half convinced, no?

579
00:50:43,770 --> 00:50:45,500
Now even if the Chief Prosecutor convinces him

580
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:50,330
the slightest bit, I think Father will agree to it.

581
00:50:50,330 --> 00:50:52,150
I got it.

582
00:51:00,020 --> 00:51:03,400
  Reporter Kim Boo Gi 

583
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:05,080
Yes.

584
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:09,560
Is that so? Understood, I'll go right away.

585
00:51:11,390 --> 00:51:13,550
What kind of call was it?

586
00:51:13,550 --> 00:51:17,340
- A call that's good for us. 
 - Is that so?

587
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:19,970
I have to go out.

588
00:51:19,970 --> 00:51:23,990
Mo Seok Hui... Good luck!

589
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:26,770
Good luck...

590
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:35,690
500 million won of company funds have been transferred to your father Heo Jang Soo's account.

591
00:51:35,690 --> 00:51:39,960
You know that if it's over 500 million, it applies to additional punishment for specific economic offense, right?

592
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:43,340
I'm a lawyer. How would I not know that?

593
00:51:45,750 --> 00:51:48,430
How come you are so full of confidence?

594
00:51:48,430 --> 00:51:53,770
Lawyer Heo, after mingling with MC, your arrogance seems to have shot through the roof.

595
00:51:55,280 --> 00:52:00,000
I'm saying this honestly, but do you remember when miss Mo Seok Hui was imprisoned last time?

596
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,120
I'm quite worried you'll make the same mistake as that time.

597
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:06,450
You should worry about yourself.

598
00:52:06,450 --> 00:52:09,350
It was very brazenly deposited using your own cell phone.

599
00:52:09,350 --> 00:52:13,070
On top of that, your phone is completely dead.

600
00:52:13,070 --> 00:52:15,470
Is that destruction of evidence?

601
00:52:18,030 --> 00:52:21,210
It seems you really only learned the bad things from TOP.

602
00:52:21,210 --> 00:52:26,640
Prosecutor Joo, for embezzlement of funds, you need to prove that it was intentionally an unlawful acquisition.

603
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:31,720
Why would I commit a crime that would so obviously be exposed? I'm not an idiot.

604
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:36,590
Besides, just the right amount of 500 million won was deposited to apply to the additional punishment law.

605
00:52:36,590 --> 00:52:40,960
And as soon as it was deposited, the prosecution came flying in with an arrest warrant.

606
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:45,390
You know about the principle of exclusion of illegally acquired evidence, right?

607
00:52:45,390 --> 00:52:51,580
Therefore my argument is that this is clearly a conspiracy.

608
00:52:55,650 --> 00:52:59,710
Lawyer Heo's fate is in your hands, Miss Seok Hui.

609
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:03,190
My fate too.

610
00:53:03,190 --> 00:53:05,550
News Patch too.

611
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:11,340
I'll be back.

612
00:53:43,350 --> 00:53:46,000
Thank you for making time to respond to my invitation.

613
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:50,500
My brave Miss Mo Seok Hui, I'm saying this because I honestly think of you like a daughter,

614
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:54,680
I'll give you a tip that will help you possess MC Group.

615
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:59,780
A tip you say... I am indeed curious.

616
00:53:59,780 --> 00:54:01,730
Hold hands with Director Han.

617
00:54:01,730 --> 00:54:05,670
Then I as well as director Han, we will all be on your side.

618
00:54:05,670 --> 00:54:08,770
You're saying you won't ever get out of Director Han's shadow, then.

619
00:54:08,770 --> 00:54:11,610
Let's send Lawyer Heo to prison.

620
00:54:11,610 --> 00:54:14,320
Then you can have MC Group.

621
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:17,850
The  arrest  without a warrant of Lawyer Heo Yoon Do yesterday,

622
00:54:17,850 --> 00:54:22,110
this is you and Director Han's joint work, isn't it?

623
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:27,450
( An arrest without a warrant can occur for murder, kidnapping, high risk of flight or destruction of evidence )

624
00:54:27,450 --> 00:54:31,930
 (TOP erased Yoon Do's hard drives so that was "destruction of evidence.") 

625
00:54:37,670 --> 00:54:39,760
 Let's get rid of Heo Yoon Do. 

626
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:42,980
 At this sensitive time, is there really a need to go this far...? 

627
00:54:42,980 --> 00:54:47,460
 This isn't about licking your lips over the position of Prosecutor General, you could be placed under arrest! 

628
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:49,390
 Director Han, please be more careful of what you say! 

629
00:54:49,390 --> 00:54:52,100
 Mo Seok Hui and Heo Yoon Do got a hold of the investigation material . 

630
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:55,530
 and a witness for the murder case of 15 years ago 

631
00:54:56,930 --> 00:55:02,000
 The moment you hesitate, everything you have could go up in smoke. 

632
00:55:07,870 --> 00:55:13,020
I understand. Since director Han's strength is quite strong.

633
00:55:13,020 --> 00:55:16,870
But, until when are you going to be Director Han's puppet?

634
00:55:18,110 --> 00:55:20,570
Don't tell me you'll even hand this down to your son?

635
00:55:20,570 --> 00:55:23,400
- Look here! 
 - Release Heo Yoon Do!

636
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:25,140
That man is a suspect of embezzlement of government funds!

637
00:55:25,140 --> 00:55:28,020
You know well that this is orchestrated by TOP.

638
00:55:32,910 --> 00:55:42,330
Prosecutor Joo, do you know what is the root of crimes like murder, robbery, burglary and corruption?

639
00:55:45,260 --> 00:55:47,030
Love.

640
00:55:47,810 --> 00:55:53,530
Of all crimes committed by mankind, most happened because of love.

641
00:55:55,880 --> 00:55:57,080
So?

642
00:55:57,080 --> 00:56:01,480
Wouldn't it be the case for your father as well?

643
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:06,000
To provide a good home, a good car, good clothes...

644
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:11,090
The heart of a father who wants to do this. It's not beyond my understanding.

645
00:56:12,850 --> 00:56:14,490
Are you done talking?

646
00:56:14,490 --> 00:56:18,290
Lawyer Heo. You're a suspect for embezzlement of government funds.

647
00:56:18,290 --> 00:56:22,680
How dare you talk gibberish and be a disgrace like that?

648
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:24,350
Do you think Korea's prosecutor is a joke?!

649
00:56:24,350 --> 00:56:28,020
The problem is that your father is a prosecutor.

650
00:56:28,020 --> 00:56:32,360
Aren't you embarrassed at doing MC's dirty work for two generations?

651
00:56:40,810 --> 00:56:44,040
This bastard, are you nuts?

652
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:47,640
Are you an incapable prosecutor or were you always a dirty prosecutor?

653
00:57:01,050 --> 00:57:05,220
Director Han, let's arrest her.

654
00:57:11,610 --> 00:57:16,750
 Director Han ordered me to give the Head Chairman a sauce that has bitter almond 

655
00:57:16,750 --> 00:57:20,680
 and text her when dinner's nearly over. 

656
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:27,430
 I didn't know Head Chairman would pass away like that, Miss. 

657
00:57:27,430 --> 00:57:31,530
Director Han is connected to Head Chairman's death?

658
00:57:31,530 --> 00:57:35,490
There's a lot of circumstantial evidence that she was determined to kill him.

659
00:57:35,490 --> 00:57:40,010
It's not easy to prove the charges of instigating murder with that much.

660
00:57:40,010 --> 00:57:42,360
Then how about this?

661
00:57:44,070 --> 00:57:47,290
 Did someone kill Grandfather? 

662
00:57:47,290 --> 00:57:50,150
 - Mo Seok Hui! 
 - Tell me the truth. 

663
00:57:50,150 --> 00:57:51,450
 Then I'll sign it. 

664
00:57:51,450 --> 00:57:52,820
 I handled it. 

665
00:57:52,820 --> 00:57:54,980
 Director Han... 

666
00:57:56,490 --> 00:57:58,920
Do you think this is all I have?

667
00:58:12,430 --> 00:58:18,580
No matter how clumsy a prosecutor is with an investigation, isn't it basic knowledge to obtain the CCTV footage?

668
00:58:19,690 --> 00:58:23,170
If you don't let Lawyer Heo go and arrest Director Han,

669
00:58:23,170 --> 00:58:26,500
the proof that the CCTV evidence was destroyed during the murder case 15 years ago

670
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:30,410
will be uploaded all over social media tomorrow.

671
00:58:32,730 --> 00:58:35,860
Then I'll do a press conference.

672
00:58:35,860 --> 00:58:40,990
You've fallen into an ambush ahead of your Prosecutor General appointment.

673
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:52,360
Look here, Miss Seok Hui, a prosecutor with lack of experience

674
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:57,900
sometimes makes mistakes during an investigation.  It happens often in this profession.

675
00:58:57,900 --> 00:59:03,680
It happens while young, and at that time, there really wasn't a CCTV.

676
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:07,410
I see it was because someone hid it away like this.

677
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:11,110
I'm a busy person.

678
00:59:12,490 --> 00:59:17,490
I only gave you my time since you're precious Miss Seok Hui from MC Group.

679
00:59:17,490 --> 00:59:21,190
You have to do something that suits your age.

680
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:30,680
Maybe... you'll like this one better?

681
00:59:34,380 --> 00:59:40,380
The policeman who was in charge of the initial investigation of the murder incident at the time, do you remember him?

682
00:59:41,410 --> 00:59:46,590
The police said they definitely handed over the CCTV footage to the prosecution.

683
00:59:46,590 --> 00:59:50,550
As soon as it got to the prosecutor's office, it disappeared.

684
01:00:03,890 --> 01:00:08,680
If you add police testimony to the list, it applies as the crime of destruction of evidence, does it not?

685
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:11,570
I hear it's a maximum jail term of 5 years.

686
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:18,000
It looks like you'll be turning down the Prosecutor General position and going to jail.

687
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:29,600
Do you think you can get rid of Director Han that easily?

688
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:33,530
TOP is a master of evidence destruction.

689
01:00:33,530 --> 01:00:39,380
So that's why I'm doing the legwork for you.

690
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:51,830
  To be honest, I'm not Lee Seo Jin's biological father. 

691
01:00:51,830 --> 01:00:56,390
  TOP planned it in order to get rid of Actress Choi Na Ri. 

692
01:00:56,390 --> 01:01:02,520
 Director Han threatened me saying that I have to sacrifice myself for MC Group's sake. 

693
01:01:02,520 --> 01:01:06,230
 Oh, she said to do the press conference in return for shares.  

694
01:01:06,230 --> 01:01:09,390
 I was coerced to do it. I had no choice. 

695
01:01:09,390 --> 01:01:12,130
 This information? Feel free to reveal it. 

696
01:01:12,130 --> 01:01:16,470
 If you need it, I can testify, too. Since it's the truth. 

697
01:01:18,090 --> 01:01:20,740
First, crime of coercion can be established, right?

698
01:01:20,740 --> 01:01:26,130
On top of that, she manipulated search words with false info and ended an actresses' career by inducing reply posts,

699
01:01:26,130 --> 01:01:30,250
so it ends up that it's also a crime of interference with business using computers.

700
01:01:30,250 --> 01:01:34,700
Well, you'd know better since you're the expert.

701
01:01:34,700 --> 01:01:41,020
Chief Prosecutor, I will make sure to block the retrial request.

702
01:01:42,310 --> 01:01:48,310
And if I'm to give you another tip, Father is on very bad terms with Director Han.

703
01:01:48,310 --> 01:01:52,010
They differ on their opinion about the successor issue.

704
01:01:52,010 --> 01:01:57,840
Well, if you agree with Father, wouldn't that lessen you burden a lot?

705
01:01:58,900 --> 01:02:05,470
Prosecutor Ji, you said two tigers can't live on a mountain together.

706
01:02:05,470 --> 01:02:09,360
You shouldn't throw around an adjective like "brave".

707
01:02:09,360 --> 01:02:12,100
I'm a brave tiger after all.

708
01:02:12,100 --> 01:02:16,860
♫  Give it to me. But your best can't hold me back.  ♫

709
01:02:18,760 --> 01:02:24,030
The arrest without a warrant  is valid for only 24 hours more.

710
01:02:24,030 --> 01:02:27,590
Release Lawyer Heo.

711
01:02:27,590 --> 01:02:30,240
If not, I'll get rid of you first.

712
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:35,600
♫  I'm on fire. I'm on fire.  ♫

713
01:02:40,190 --> 01:02:45,520
♫  You are liar. You are liar.  ♫

714
01:02:45,850 --> 01:02:49,440
( Someone arrested without a warrant can only be held for 48 hours. )

715
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:53,110
( If a judge does not approve an arrest warrant in 48 hours, the prosecutor must release the arrestee. )

716
01:03:15,730 --> 01:03:21,320
 If you add police testimony to the list, it applies as the crime of destruction of evidence, does it not? 

717
01:03:21,320 --> 01:03:24,360
 I hear it's a maximum jail term of 5 years. 

718
01:03:25,460 --> 01:03:30,720
 It looks like you'll be turning down the Prosecutor General position and going to jail. 

719
01:03:45,190 --> 01:03:48,620
Yes. It's me.

720
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:05,710
Both you and I are very troubled recently with something which happened in the past.

721
01:04:06,860 --> 01:04:12,600
Director Han will handle the problem.

722
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:20,490
Chairman, I hear you've been at odds recently with her over the successor issue.

723
01:04:20,490 --> 01:04:26,580
Can you trust her with a dangerous bomb in her hands?

724
01:04:30,710 --> 01:04:36,810
Can you offer an alternative?

725
01:04:38,080 --> 01:04:44,150
A master doesn't make any needless moves.

726
01:04:49,310 --> 01:04:53,390
I will bury those murder cases which are bothersome for everyone,

727
01:04:54,070 --> 01:04:58,060
take the position of President of Korea,

728
01:04:58,060 --> 01:05:02,620
and you can now part ways with Director Han.

729
01:05:08,270 --> 01:05:10,770
Director Han ...

730
01:05:13,510 --> 01:05:16,580
is that really possible?

731
01:05:17,670 --> 01:05:19,760
That task ...

732
01:05:21,120 --> 01:05:23,710
is my specialty.

733
01:05:50,600 --> 01:05:56,480
Wan Joon, isn't this music wonderful?

734
01:06:04,210 --> 01:06:09,450
Anyway, your artistic discernment is zero.

735
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:15,000
Artistic ability is an unnecessary qualification for me.

736
01:06:15,020 --> 01:06:21,010
Did you know Wagner's music inspired Steve Jobs to create the iPod?

737
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:27,490
Bill Gates always envied Jobs' artistic discernment.

738
01:06:27,490 --> 01:06:33,360
So?  Ah. You want to run an art business?

739
01:06:34,170 --> 01:06:40,670
After all, it was Steve Jobs' outstanding artistic perception which changed history.

740
01:06:40,670 --> 01:06:44,390
But you are not Jobs.

741
01:06:44,390 --> 01:06:50,430
Isn't discussing art with a third rate movie director's qualification too much?

742
01:06:54,660 --> 01:07:00,560
Would you be as confident without Director Han?

743
01:07:04,470 --> 01:07:09,590
Confidence is expressed by someone's ability.

744
01:07:20,780 --> 01:07:22,590
Sure.

745
01:07:24,070 --> 01:07:26,560
Wait and see.  You'll find out.

746
01:07:32,700 --> 01:07:34,820
Prosecutor Joo.

747
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:43,590
A real prosecutor doesn't arrest people like me but arrests people like Director Han.

748
01:07:48,040 --> 01:07:50,530
Do you want to live like your father?

749
01:07:51,260 --> 01:07:57,360
 Cases stacking up one by one will eventually become your personal history as a prosecutor. 

750
01:07:57,360 --> 01:08:00,850
 Living like this isn't right, don't you think? 

751
01:08:21,560 --> 01:08:23,520
Yes, Father.

752
01:08:39,560 --> 01:08:41,450
Father.

753
01:08:43,780 --> 01:08:46,980
What's going on?

754
01:08:46,980 --> 01:08:50,080
Release Lawyer Heo.

755
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:51,810
What?

756
01:08:54,580 --> 01:08:59,430
Did we really get played by Director Han?

757
01:09:05,550 --> 01:09:10,040
- But, Father, what on earth did you, with Director Han-- 
 - Prosecutor Joo ...

758
01:09:11,270 --> 01:09:16,460
I've always made the best choice at that moment. That applies to right now, too.

759
01:09:16,460 --> 01:09:20,360
You've always told me that a fist is stronger than the fingers.

760
01:09:20,360 --> 01:09:23,250
If we overcome all the difficult tasks together, anything is possible.

761
01:09:23,250 --> 01:09:27,420
What exactly is the situation? Please tell me.

762
01:09:28,260 --> 01:09:34,180
No father in the world can be judged by his child.

763
01:09:34,180 --> 01:09:36,090
Listen carefully.

764
01:10:37,450 --> 01:10:40,250
I said I would get you out, didn't I?

765
01:11:50,450 --> 01:11:53,390
Why hasn't he come?

766
01:11:57,270 --> 01:12:01,460
Son! My goodness, Son. You suffered a lot!

767
01:12:01,500 --> 01:12:05,520
Your face looks gaunt.

768
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:10,030
Kid.  Because of you I couldn't eat.

769
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:15,850
Okay.  Did you eat regularly?

770
01:12:15,850 --> 01:12:19,350
Look at the state of your face. Sit.

771
01:12:19,350 --> 01:12:24,710
I warmed up some tofu.  It's  organic. Wait.

772
01:12:24,710 --> 01:12:27,060
That hurt!

773
01:12:45,870 --> 01:12:49,390
But, what will you do with Attorney Heo?

774
01:12:52,360 --> 01:12:55,280
Now we will have to get him imprisoned.

775
01:12:55,280 --> 01:12:57,070
Yes.

776
01:13:00,850 --> 01:13:04,100
 Chief Prosecutor Joo Hyeong Il 

777
01:13:04,100 --> 01:13:07,950
 The person you have called  is not available.  At the sound of the beep ... 

778
01:13:09,150 --> 01:13:11,740
Miss Seok Hui is coming in.

779
01:13:54,520 --> 01:13:59,180
It was a false accusation. I've been released without being charged.

780
01:14:01,110 --> 01:14:05,580
We're thinking of suing everyone at TOP for making a false accusation.

781
01:14:06,940 --> 01:14:10,240
But it'll be better for Director Han to go as a representative, right?

782
01:14:12,370 --> 01:14:17,730
Crime of false accusation?  Isn't that too trivial?

783
01:14:17,730 --> 01:14:19,690
Is that what you think?

784
01:14:20,540 --> 01:14:26,570
Are you disappointed?  True, we have to consider your greatness.

785
01:14:28,790 --> 01:14:31,680
Han Chae Gook,  you are under arrest

786
01:14:31,680 --> 01:14:35,020
for extortion through fraud and for interference with business through use of a computer.

 Graceful Family Preview 

793
01:15:21,240 --> 01:15:23,650
 I hear there's an arrest warrant for Director Han.  

794
01:15:23,650 --> 01:15:25,140
 You'll have to suffer a bit. 

795
01:15:25,140 --> 01:15:28,490
 We have to make a new TOP from now on, little by little. 

796
01:15:28,490 --> 01:15:31,770
 We're almost there. Getting rid of dirty bastards. 

797
01:15:31,770 --> 01:15:34,990
 15 years ago, there was an incident where Ahn Jae Rim was murdered. 

798
01:15:34,990 --> 01:15:37,600
 The one locked up in jail is my mother. 

799
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:38,980
 It's already in the past. 

800
01:15:38,980 --> 01:15:42,650
 Until the real culprit is caught, this incident will never be over. 

801
01:15:42,650 --> 01:15:44,450
 - Get out! 
 - I don't want to!  

802
01:15:44,450 --> 01:15:48,710
 By chance, is the real culprit among the family members?
