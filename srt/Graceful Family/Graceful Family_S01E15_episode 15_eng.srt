00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,160
 Episode 15 

7
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:35,840
 So where are you going to be studying abroad? 

8
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,120
 I'll make my decision later today. 

9
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:44,010
 Honey, not only Ivy League schools, but also other western private and public prestigious  universities, 

10
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:50,350
 are offering him scholarships. 

11
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:54,400
 Most of the chaebol kids go to schools where the chaebol has donated money. 

12
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:58,250
 Only Wan Joon gets offered scholarships to go there. 

13
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:01,360
 I'm so proud of our son. 

14
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:04,310
 Only Wan Joon could do that. 

15
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,470
 Why attend for a long time? 

16
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:10,530
 You should complete the Ph.D. quickly and start administrative work. 

17
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:13,340
 Actually, I'm planning to complete the Ph.D. in five years. 

18
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:16,440
 How can you! 

19
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:20,510
 Be careful of life in the US. 

20
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:25,510
 It is a country where shootings and kidnappings frequently occur. 

21
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:28,720
 How can you be so mean! 

22
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:34,140
 - Honey, look into getting him a bodyguard. 
 - Yeah. 

23
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:39,180
  Mother, a bodyguard?  I can take care of myself so don't worry. 

24
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:42,690
 No. When you were kidnapped as a child,  

25
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:46,070
  I truly felt I lost the whole world. 

26
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:49,710
 It can never happen a second time. 

27
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:59,030


28
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:04,560
 Mom! Mom! 

29
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:11,070
 Wan Joon! Wan Joon! Wan Joon! 

30
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:14,380
  Why has  Wan Joon ... 

31
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:18,170
 Why has our Wan Joon been kidnapped?  Why? 

32
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:24,030
 Why not kidnap Wan Soo? Why of all children, Wan Joon? 

33
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:27,070
 Calm down.  We'll apprehend the criminal soon. 

34
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:31,630
 My Wan Joon. Oh my god! 

35
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:34,880
 Please find him. 

36
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:38,160
 Please find Wan Joon. 

37
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:46,500
  What life can a child live, whose very existence has been denied at the age of eight? 

38
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:54,560
 Oh, is it my turn? 

39
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,760
 I am Mo Wan Soo. 

40
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:04,110
  I majored in physical education.  I've ridden a horse for a while, but I'm not very good at it. 

41
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:08,220
 Sometimes, with childlike bravado 

42
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:10,960
 Genius 

43
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:31,200
 Sometimes, with a foolhardy attempt to absorb  all the knowledge of the world, 

44
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:02,030
 Good bye!  

45
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,850
 Sometimes with self-torment through self-destructive behavior. 

46
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:33,650
 I knew you could do it. 

47
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:39,660
 Son, I'm so proud of you. 

48
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:44,870
 It was only possible because you are Young Master Mo Wan Soo. 

49
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:54,900
 Hyung, Congratulations.  Acknowledged!  

50
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:28,570
 Was being recognized by people, 

51
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:33,200
 especially Mom, perhaps the only thing he desired? 

52
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:46,140
 Graceful Family 

53
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:53,700
I thought it was very unusual that you disliked and were excessively on guard toward Miss Seok Hui.

54
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:56,760
Isn't it because you are siblings, not father and child?

55
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:59,920
What?  Siblings?

56
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:07,390
This person, really. Director Han, are you insane?

57
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:12,100
- Housekeeper Jeong so testified. 
 - Huh?

58
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:15,070
Miss Seok Hui is the Grand Chairman's daughter.

59
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:22,690
She is not your daughter.

60
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:41,450
  When there is undeniably an eldest son in the family, why are you insisting ... 

61
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:43,380
 What does the generation or the eldest son have do do with it now? 

62
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:46,410
 Seok Hui, you have to study management now and come home. 

63
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:51,020
 Grandpa. I think studying that would be boring 

64
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:52,980
 Seok Hui. 

65
00:06:56,670 --> 00:07:01,900
 As an advancement, I, Mo Wan Pyo,  give all my MC Distribution stock and real estate to my granddaughter. 

66
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:04,970
 If my granddaughter Mo Soek Hui dies or is an accident, 

67
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:09,900
 all my property is to be donated to charity. 

68
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:14,090
 I don't consider you my son. 

69
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:19,380
 Certificate of Genetic Relationship 

70
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:58,390
It wasn't unexpected that Prosecutor Joo would be eyeing Director Han at the funeral hall.

71
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:01,180
His father died because of Director Han's manipulation of the media.

72
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:04,150
Well, he couldn't be feeling very positive.

73
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,490
Anyway, while we await the outcome of the retrial request,

74
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:10,540
we need to focus on collecting evidence of crime against Director Han so we can send her to jail.

75
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:14,390
So, I mean ...

76
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,830
Are you thinking the same thing as me?

77
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,120
I think so.

78
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,600
 Father is in critical condition. 

79
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:40,810
My father is in the emergency room.

80
00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:42,550
What?

81
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:07,870
The chairman is unconscious because of an acute cerebral hemorrhage. (  stroke )

82
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:13,290
As of now, it's not certain that he will regain consciousness.

83
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:15,400
I am sorry.

84
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:25,450
What happened?

85
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:30,600
Obviously, it's because of that reconsideration, or whatever it's called.

86
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,710
Director Han, is that the real reason?

87
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:38,690
There has been a lot of different traumatic events.

88
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:28,290
Why did my father suddenly collapse?

89
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,730
It seems you  know.

90
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:37,390
Father was opposed to Wan Joon.  You were pushing for Wan Joon.

91
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:41,410
The thinking of you two were directly opposed.

92
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:44,290
Did you prevail in the end?

93
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:49,460
That's why I want to know more about why father collapsed.

94
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:53,740
It's obvious. The situation in which your father collapsed ...

95
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:57,610
I feel more sorry about it than you do.

96
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,620
Then ...

97
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:22,260
 How did we end up like this? 

98
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:28,600
 Is this what happened to our relationship because of Mom's death? 

99
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:33,530
 I want to know the truth. 

100
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:40,690
 In the end, you chose to be silent. 

101
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:52,370
 (Housekeeper Jeong) You, if you just shut my mouth, you think it will all be over. 

102
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:56,410
 By doing so, do you think that the Grand Chairman's daughter will be buried? 

103
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:59,820
 Your way is never going to happen. 

104
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:04,400
- Isn't this a major event? 
 - What a shocker!

105
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:06,720
- Do you think Miss Seok Hui also knows? 
 - Not yet.

106
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,430
The axis of the equity relationships may shift.

107
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:13,650
Why would Mo Seok Hui being the daughter of the Grand Chairman cause a shift?

108
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:16,940
First, her rights are the same as Chairman Mo Cheol Hui.

109
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:21,870
However, for her inherited reserve share of as much as 25% of what the Grand Chairman owned,

110
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:27,550
she can claim 25% of the shares held by Vice-Chairman Mo Wan Joon and the other family members.

111
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:30,240
Wouldn't the equity structure change if she succeeds?

112
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,000
There is a high probability that will happen.

113
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:37,920
Didn't I tell you?  You can't even put one dollar into a gambler's hand.

114
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:41,450
Because even one dollar could  carry  a reversal.

115
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:46,050
You must completely prevent Mo Seok Hui from claiming the reserved shares.

116
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:49,840
We assigned a female guard to watch Housekeeper Jeong 24/7.

117
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,970
Well done.

118
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:55,530
Let's proceed now with the inauguration of Vice-Chairman Mo Wan Joon as chairman.

119
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:56,530
We will.

120
00:12:56,530 --> 00:12:59,660
Oh, Director.  We took care of appointing the judge for the retrial.

121
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:02,350
Is that so? You did well.

122
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:09,980
Let's go up.

123
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:19,650
We're proceeding with your inauguration.

124
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:22,570
When?

125
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:26,750
After we finish preparations, it will be a week from now.

126
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:33,580
Shouldn't we wait and see my father's status?

127
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,530
Are you serious?

128
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,900
- Do you know why I want you to be the leader? 
 - Pardon?

129
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:49,190
At first it was because the Chairman wanted that and I had no reason to strenuously object.

130
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:53,690
But when I learned you were a transgender, I became certain.

131
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:58,000
The patience you've endured for a long time despite your own flaw.

132
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,600
The tenacity to hang on from start to finish toward your goal.

133
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,200
You are more than sufficiently qualified to be our leader.

134
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:11,360
I understand.

135
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:16,360
Director Han, you've worked very hard.

136
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:30,830
Shall we now quickly wrap the succession up and hold the inauguration?

137
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:35,350
At times like this, Wan Joon, you need to take center stage.

138
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:41,050
Yes. I've discussed it with Director Han.  We will have the inauguration next week.

139
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:43,920
All right.  Good thinking.

140
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:52,000
Father's life is hanging by a thread and you're talking about being inaugurated in his position.

141
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:59,400
Mother and  Wan Joon, aren't you even half-human?

142
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:06,520
It's less than half-human.  They are an affront to heaven, agreed?

143
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:13,020
Why did Father suddenly collapse?

144
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:16,180
No one seems to be curious.

145
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:18,980
Don't you think maybe it was because of you?

146
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:22,920
It's laughable that the heroine who stirred up trouble about a murder case  or whatever

147
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:25,300
talks about an affront to heaven.

148
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,980
Father is in a sick bed.  If keying numbers in a calculator

149
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:32,720
isn't an affront to heaven, what is?

150
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,890
Father refused to allow you to become his successor.

151
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:38,770
But the time he collapsed is very strange.

152
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:44,090
So what? Are you now saying someone somehow caused it?

153
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:48,400
Instead of  being unreasonable,  do what you need to do.

154
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,260
Be reasonable?

155
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:56,300
If Father were to fall, who would benefit the most? Isn't that reasonable?

156
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:04,220
Grandfather, Father.

157
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:08,800
Everyone dies or collapses during a critical time.

158
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:13,520
Is that our family's custom?

159
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:18,150
That's an incredible coincidence.

160
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:23,340
When coincidences overlap, then it becomes inevitable for us.

161
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:27,870
I don't want to be the heroine of the inevitable.

162
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:32,190
Our family ... it would be too cruel and savage.

163
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:34,440
Nothing good comes from vainly sparring with words.

164
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:39,000
- You must be tired.  Go upstairs and rest. 
 - Yes.

165
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:57,290
Kid.  As I expected, your thoughts are so similar to mine.

166
00:16:57,290 --> 00:17:01,470
Anyway, it's because we are revolutionary comrades.

167
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:06,960
But, Seok Hui. Now, we are both going to be burned at the stake.

168
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:07,920
Why?

169
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:12,320
Always when a revolution fails, everyone dies.

170
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:19,240
But, are you just going to watch Wan Joon's inauguration?

171
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:23,900
Because if I become the successor,  I would support you firmly ... I told you to stick with me.

172
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:27,450
My father is lying sick in bed.  What can I do now?

173
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:32,900
By nature, when times are tougher than they are good, I have a flashy style.

174
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,820
So what I'm saying is,

175
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:41,020
Don't you want to get the shares back you handed over to Father?

176
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:44,720
If we put your and my legal shares together,

177
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,260
we could jointly manage the company.

178
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:54,100
- I'll talk to Lawyer Heo about the reserve shares. 
 - I knew it!

179
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:13,040
 Prosecutor Joo. If you are a real prosecutor, instead of catching people like me, 

180
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:16,030
 you would be catching people like Director Han. 

181
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:20,170
  The problem is  that your father was a prosecutor. 

182
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:24,210
  Aren't you embarrassed by doing MC's dirty work for two generations 

183
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:43,540
With the collapse of Chairman Mo Cheol Hui, even the brake for Director Han's power disappeared.

184
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:46,860
Being the head of a large company is the world's best medicine.  Shouldn't he be getting out of bed?

185
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:50,600
- His condition must be critical. 
 Actually, our condition is worse.

186
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:54,110
Director Han was released. The prosecutor who was leading the investigation committed suicide.

187
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:58,650
The prosecution hasn't given us the original investigation file. Right now we're in the middle of nowhere, aren't we?

188
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:01,580
What's the judge who was assigned the retrial like?

189
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:04,610
Reviewing  the cases of Judge Lee Min Yeong of the Yoondo Central District Court  involving big businesses,

190
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:09,490
he has a history of heavy punishment for creating slush funds and is not bad.

191
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:11,120
Then, can we look forward?

192
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,430
Considering Director Han's influence on the legal profession, we shouldn't draw a hasty conclusion.

193
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:17,650
Anyway, she is always a problem.

194
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:20,580
Can't we get her back into detention?

195
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:24,640
 That's why I was considering including the grand chairman's murder in a  conspiracy, but it's not easy. 

196
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:28,200
- We have the servants' statements. 
 - That's insufficient evidence.

197
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:32,540
It would be good to have the testimony of  Dr. Hwang, the chairman's doctor, but he refused.

198
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:35,560
We need to find a way to get him to help our side.

199
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:39,190
Hyungnim, could you dig something up on Dr. Hwang?

200
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:42,530
Well, if I'm digging, I should dig hard.

201
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:45,060
Even Director Han doesn't think we would stop  now.

202
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:49,050
By hook or crook, we will get Dr. Hwang. Please reach out to him.

203
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:50,370
Okay.  All right.

204
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:55,660
In any case we're in this fight to the end.

205
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:57,370
What are you guys hesitating about?

206
00:19:57,370 --> 00:19:59,130
Of course.

207
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,420
It's Heo Yoon Do.

208
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:14,280
How is your father doing?

209
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:22,310
But are you here alone at the hospital?

210
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:24,740
Everyone is busy.

211
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:30,150
Are you here because you were curious about my father's condition?

212
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:34,000
Because I'm concerned about you.

213
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:44,820
Receiving attention isn't bad.

214
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:53,520
I'm fine.  Don't worry.

215
00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:01,100
- I contacted Prosecutor Joo. 
 - Really?

216
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:06,100
- It's what we wanted. 
 - When will you meet?

217
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:10,200
- Tomorrow. 
 - I see.

218
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:23,780
Cheer up.  You're not alone.

219
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:59,570
It was a shame about your father.

220
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:03,130
Wasn't that the outcome you two wanted?

221
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:06,290
What we wanted was the truth.

222
00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:09,740
Aren't you also sitting here now because you know that?

223
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:15,320
I don't think your father was a good prosecutor.

224
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:22,990
However, I'm not going to criticize  you as a son about the way you feel about your father's death.

225
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:26,490
So, what do you intend to do?

226
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:29,760
Director Han was involved in the charge of embezzlement against Lawyer Heo

227
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:34,360
and the accusation against my father for obstruction of justice. There is evidence to that effect.

228
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,050
Evidence?

229
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:40,130
For the past few days I've been tracking and learned my father's whereabouts.

230
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:44,860
Naturally I knew my father's shameful history.

231
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:46,810
Why do you want to work with us?

232
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:49,310
Anyone can be beaten once.

233
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:53,950
If anyone gets beaten a second time, there is a problem with that person.

234
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,230
Han Je Gook is not an easy opponent.

235
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:02,130
Of course, you both know that well.

236
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:07,930
This is a game which must be won.

237
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:10,180
In a fight with Director Han,

238
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:14,590
I think you two are  a few degrees higher than I am.

239
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:20,080
The more charges we have against her, the more likely we are to arrest her.

240
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,400
That makes sense now.

241
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,780
Indictment is possible  currently on the charges of interference with business by computer and coercion,

242
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:30,760
which you two worked on, but I cannot guarantee she will go to prison.

243
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,390
Of course.

244
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:38,090
Clearly, in the legal field, she is much more powerful than me.

245
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:41,530
So, have you got a better method?

246
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:46,070
Without a doubt, you didn't think I jumped with empty hands when you said we could catch her, do you?

247
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:48,400
Of course.

248
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:53,980
When we gather everything we have, Director Han ... we will go to a gallery of crime. Well.

249
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:59,390
Prosecutor Joo,  I have a favor to ask.

250
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:03,490
Could you intercede and get us access to the file from 15 years ago

251
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:07,000
which the prosecutor sealed?

252
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:19,810
  Murder Case Investigation Report of Ahn Jae Rim  

253
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,640
Dig hard.

254
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:31,610
we are going against Director Han. Prepare with all you got, after that, leave it to me.

255
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,470
Is that the Joo Tae Hyeong I know?

256
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:42,500
He must have been pretty shocked.

257
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:46,590
It's because he is that desperate.

258
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:57,760
The prosecution's investigation data shows a forensic report that we don't have.

259
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:03,150
Right, there's a chance that a police medical examiner was dispatched to the murder scene.

260
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:05,380
But this police medical examiner...

261
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:09,420
said that it's been 3-4 hours since the victim died.

262
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:11,180
What was the time the medical examiner examined the victim?

263
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:17,590
5:10 PM. So the time of death was between 1 or 2 PM.

264
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:20,850
So the time of death being 4 PM was also a fabrication.

265
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:25,600
Based on this, the forensic autopsy also seems to be fabricated.

266
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:29,290
If the time of death was between 1 and 2 PM...

267
00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:32,720
I was with my mother at that time.

268
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:37,370
Lawyer Heo. We finally found an alibi for your mother.

269
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:47,120
If the murder occured between 1 and 2 PM...

270
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:51,190
then Chairman Mo and Han Je Gook will be excluded from the list of suspects since they visited afterwards.

271
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:55,410
So father and Han Je Gook are out of the list of suspects now?

272
00:25:55,410 --> 00:25:59,220
So it's very likely that Han Je Gook came to clean up the scene.

273
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:05,040
Instead, Mo Wan Joon at 11 AM, Ha Yeong Seo at 1:25 PM and Mo Wan Soo at 1:45 PM.

274
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:10,840
The people who arrived closest to the time of the murder are Ha Young Seo and Mo Wan So.

275
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:13,710
This is a picture of the scene, and these are pictures of the evidence.

276
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:17,860
There's wine, a weapon, even the painting...

277
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:21,960
There's no book called "The Back of the Image" in the evidence list.

278
00:26:22,810 --> 00:26:25,160
  I'm back.  

279
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,800
  The Back of the Image  

280
00:26:28,810 --> 00:26:32,000
  There is one more thing missing besides the book.  

281
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,340
Which one?

282
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:35,090
A glass of wine.

283
00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:39,170
I definitely saw a glass of wine on that day at the scene.

284
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:45,790
- It's unnatural to have a bottle of wine with a cork but no glass. 
 - That's right.

285
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:48,680
- You also don't pop a bottle of wine without glasses. 
 - You are right.

286
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:51,970
So the book and the glass of wine are missing. Why?

287
00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:53,760
Maybe they  were hidden on purpose?

288
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:58,720
Because that book and wine glass are crucial clues to the criminal?

289
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:04,830
Mother didn't drink alcohol. If she drank it was something like champagne.

290
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:11,750
Hold on...

291
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:17,710
That wine... Ha Yeong Seo drinks it often.

292
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:21,550
That doesn't mean no one else drank it though.

293
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:25,790
The remaining suspects are Ha Yeong Seo, Mo Wan Joon and Mo Wan Soo.

294
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:30,370
From these three people, who is a common denominator of a book and wine?

295
00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:32,280
Wan Soo Oppa, who likes alcohol and books?

296
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,620
Let's get it first.

297
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:39,500
So does Ha Yeong Seo. She likes wine, has an intellectual vanity and felt inferior to my mom.

298
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:43,160
- Maybe she took the book to show off. 
 - Let's get her too.

299
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:46,910
Homosexuals can make great artifical breasts but...

300
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:50,070
their shoulder blades do not hide the fact that they are men.

301
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:51,970
That is what the book says.

302
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:57,310
Considering his sexual identity, it could also be Mo Wan Joon's book.

303
00:27:57,310 --> 00:28:00,780
As expected, our senior reporter from NewsPatch.

304
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:05,400
After all... we can't rule out any of the three suspects.

305
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:09,270
Ah, my head is splitting.

306
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:14,270
Wait. Maybe the three of them killed her together?

307
00:28:15,410 --> 00:28:16,880
I am sorry.

308
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:21,690
Detective Oh, if you compare today's records with those of the National Forensic Service...

309
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:25,470
I can make sure that the time of death was fabricated.

310
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:29,510
You want me to find that medical examiner for the National Forensic Service?

311
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:32,040
You've got a unique sense, since you're a detective.

312
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:34,810
So in today's gathering we discovered the alibi for Heo's mother

313
00:28:34,810 --> 00:28:36,960
and that the time of death was fabricated and the suspects

314
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:41,040
are narrowed down to three people: Ha Yeong Seo, Mo Wan Joon and Mo Wan Soo.

315
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:45,810
Ah, if the retrial is going through we can call everyone in and investigate.

316
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:48,850
As we expected, succeeding in the retrial request is the key factor.

317
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,300
Well then, we have a place to go first so...

318
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:56,210
- Us? 
 - Where?

319
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:59,790
Ah it's nothing like that.

320
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:01,920
Then what is it?

321
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:04,520
You want a scene like this, right?

322
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:07,040
Oh? When...

323
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:09,400
- Let's go. 
 - Yeah.

324
00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:15,090
They look pretty good together.

325
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:17,040
Right.

326
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,370
Agasshi. Good to see you.

327
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:32,860
The GPS brought me here.

328
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:35,490
It's the same as before.

329
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:37,500
Have you been well?

330
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,910
It's been a while.

331
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:51,180
It's pretty, right? It's a gift from you.

332
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,220
  What about Baek Soo Jin?  

333
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:02,930
  It's moving as expected.  

334
00:30:02,930 --> 00:30:05,120
  Who are you? Let me see your face.  

335
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:09,390
  My friend went to Italy to study music and then changed his major to cooking.  

336
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:12,500
  The common denominator of music seems to have caught the attention of the little lady.  

337
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:13,780
  Good job.  

338
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:17,150
  How far have they gone? Let's see.  

339
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:27,270
I knew it but now that I hear it, I feel better.

340
00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:35,870
Is Wan Joon doing well?

341
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:40,890
Let's sue Han Je Gook for fraud.

342
00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:44,390
It already ended so why bother being noisy...

343
00:30:44,390 --> 00:30:48,350
Eonni .. This is for me.

344
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:49,530
What?

345
00:30:49,530 --> 00:30:52,850
We need your help.

346
00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:17,360
The judgment history is progressive and the reputation is not bad.

347
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:21,590
Considering her husband's support for studying abroad, she is also devoted to her family.

348
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:22,810
What is her Achilles heel? (  weak point  )

349
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:27,880
That her son is a middle school bully, and her husband is unemployed despite holding a doctorate from the US.

350
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:33,270
She gave her devotion to her family but her son is a bully... That's a pity.

351
00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:34,400
So what is the alternative?

352
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:37,930
For the negative method, what about using her bully of a son?

353
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:42,620
The deviance of the high-ranking upper class children is always a hot item.

354
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,630
What are your thoughts, Team Leader Yoon?

355
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:47,660
I think it's a good way to raise her to the Supreme Court

356
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:50,480
because she cares about her reputation and has a strong desire for fame.

357
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,000
A strong desire for fame?

358
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,700
- What is the major of the husband? 
 - It's Korean Studies

359
00:31:55,700 --> 00:32:00,380
- He received his Ph.D. in the US for Korean studies? 
 - Yes.

360
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:04,530
All right.

361
00:32:04,530 --> 00:32:07,960
  Gang's Steakhouse  

362
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:15,510
You seem to like the wine.

363
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:18,820
It's quite sweet.

364
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:24,680
If you had stayed in court, you would have reached the top as a female judge.

365
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:25,750
It's unfortunate.

366
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:29,960
In today's atmosphere, it could have been possible.

367
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:36,990
In the past, I heard that women judges had a lot of difficulties in promotion in many ways.

368
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:41,530
In front of today's standards, the past can only stay humble.

369
00:32:41,530 --> 00:32:43,860
Yes.

370
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:46,560
What are you going to do with the retrial?

371
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,440
The retrial?

372
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:51,260
I am reviewing it.

373
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:54,470
The authority of the judiciary is created by the judiciary.

374
00:32:54,470 --> 00:33:02,250
As soon as the retrial is accepted, the court will probably be caught up in a lot of the squalid past.

375
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:04,430
You're someone who takes personal honor importantly.

376
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:08,400
You don't think the honor of the judiciary is a different thing, do you?

377
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:16,610
Your husband, interestingly, got a degree in Korean Studies in the United States.

378
00:33:16,610 --> 00:33:18,790
It's a unique background.

379
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:23,390
Our MC Group will open a department on Korea at an American university.

380
00:33:23,390 --> 00:33:28,890
Korea is still an outsider in the U.S. compared to China and Japan.

381
00:33:28,890 --> 00:33:33,270
What the country can't do... It's good if a business can interfere and give some support.

382
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:34,710
Why..... to me..?

383
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:36,300
The wife has to pay for it.

384
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:41,270
The husband has to become a professor at an American university to balance the situation.

385
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:51,900
 Seoul Central District Court 

386
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:15,770
It is rejected. It was done as you intended.

387
00:34:15,770 --> 00:34:19,290
The dismissal of the retrial was scheduled.

388
00:34:21,430 --> 00:34:22,490
How about the preparations for the inauguration?

389
00:34:22,490 --> 00:34:26,890
We plan to invite directors, presidents of each affiliate, vice presidents and so on to the inauguration ceremony.

390
00:34:26,890 --> 00:34:29,450
No, include also the subsidiaries' department heads.

391
00:34:29,450 --> 00:34:33,760
We need the image of a Chairman with whom employees can personally communicate.

392
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:34,770
What about the press?

393
00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:36,570
We've already distributed the vice-president's performance-oriented article

394
00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:38,990
and it will go out on a daily basis until the inauguration ceremony.

395
00:34:38,990 --> 00:34:39,890
Will that work?

396
00:34:39,890 --> 00:34:43,720
Then how about inviting reporters to the inauguration?

397
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:45,040
Good.

398
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:48,690
Let's have a press conference 30 minutes before the inauguration.

399
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:52,040
- Get the questions in advance and prepare the answers thoroughly. 
 - I will prepare it.

400
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:58,780
And on the evening of the inauguration, let's invite major political and business leaders to dinner separately.

401
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:02,280
And get my final approval for the list of public figures who will be invited to the banquet.

402
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,310
Yes, understood.

403
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:08,720
Wait, call in Lawyer Heo.

404
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,520
I will.

405
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,410
Okay.

406
00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:20,850
How about Housekeeper Jeong?

407
00:35:20,850 --> 00:35:26,910
  About that ... Housekeeper Jeong must be very annoyed with the security guard glued to her.  

408
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:28,750
  Is that so?  

409
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:33,340
  TOP - A legal team dedicated to the MC Group  

410
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:36,060
  Let's just let her go.  

411
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:37,750
  Excuse me?  

412
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:41,600
  And housekeeper Jeong's house... do not leave a single hair end and tidy it up.  

413
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:45,180
  Especially the trace of Grand Chairman ... everything related to him.  

414
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:47,120
  I understand.  

415
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:03,260
Son ... did something upset you?

416
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,920
It's not unexpected.

417
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:09,060
Think of it as rolling in the mud.

418
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:15,960
Before you get in the mud, you worry about what to do if you get mud on your clothes...

419
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:19,980
But if you're already in, you're not scared one bit even about your clothes being wet.

420
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:30,360
Son, you already got mud on your clothes. What are you afraid of?

421
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:33,630
Father, I'm fine.

422
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:38,480
But will I be able to endure it persistently? It worries me.

423
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:41,040
Endure or not...

424
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,550
Whose son are you?

425
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:54,340
Yes, sit down.

426
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:10,600
- Are you okay? 
 - Yeah, I'm fine.

427
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:13,690
I already know by hearing your voice.

428
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:16,640
You are not okay.

429
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:21,630
We're all expecting it and we're taking the next step.

430
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:26,850
You're right. It doesn't even compare to our expectations.

431
00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:30,610
Still, I was looking forward to it in my heart, it seems.

432
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:36,750
I... didn't eat.

433
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:39,550
Is that so? Should we eat?

434
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:42,480
Yeah. Meat!

435
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:48,080
Father, give us five servings of our meat!

436
00:37:56,170 --> 00:37:59,000
  Team Leader Yoon  

437
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,460
What's wrong?

438
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:02,580
It's Team Leader Yoon.

439
00:38:04,330 --> 00:38:06,430
This is Heo Yoon Doo.

440
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:10,520
Seeing your expression, it seems you were looking forward to something.

441
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:13,350
Are you that naive, Lawyer Heo?

442
00:38:14,610 --> 00:38:16,770
Being naive is not a strength.

443
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:19,950
Did you call me to check how naive I am?

444
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:25,020
You know Usain Bolt right? The Olympics gold medal winning athlete.

445
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,330
His father told him, "If you are going to run, work hard,

446
00:38:28,330 --> 00:38:33,490
But if you lose even after trying hard, just quit."

447
00:38:33,490 --> 00:38:36,600
In my opinion his father is a very wise person.

448
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:40,320
In the end, he got a gold medal though.

449
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:44,620
It's unfortunate, but you don't even have the opportunity to enter the competition.

450
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:47,700
I... am not going to give up.

451
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,860
This isn't a problem you can solve with obstinacy.

452
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:52,110
This is not a question of obstinacy, but of conviction.

453
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:58,090
Lawyer Heo.  The world is run by strict discipline and order.

454
00:38:59,610 --> 00:39:03,430
What rule do you think moves the world?

455
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:10,260
A few very special people change history,

456
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:14,760
and the large capital of a small minority feeds and supports the entire humankind.

457
00:39:15,650 --> 00:39:19,690
Director Han, you are a social class ideologist in a very radical elitism.

458
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:22,290
We live in a capitalist world, you know.

459
00:39:22,290 --> 00:39:25,210
The essence of today's world is inequality.

460
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:30,720
The owners as owners, and the workers in their position of worker, playing their roles is how it should be.

461
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:33,540
So..

462
00:39:35,450 --> 00:39:39,580
You're saying, ordinary people like us should only live receiving what the capitalists deign to throw to us.

463
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:42,580
Saying "Oh, thank you!" no matter what they do.

464
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:46,670
MC has to be steadfast for a great many employees and families to enjoy the benefits.

465
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:48,850
Keeping this system is my job.

466
00:39:48,850 --> 00:39:52,100
Yes well, I acknowledge your belief.

467
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:57,590
But can this belief justify all illegality, corruption and crime?

468
00:39:57,590 --> 00:40:01,010
Of course! Numerous people's survival is at stake.

469
00:40:01,010 --> 00:40:04,060
There's nothing that comes before survival.

470
00:40:04,850 --> 00:40:08,520
Do you know why I can't make Soek Hui a leader?

471
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:11,480
An owner needs to have the dignity and prestige fitting to an owner.

472
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:15,450
But Miss Seok Hui keeps on trying to go down towards the bottom.

473
00:40:15,450 --> 00:40:20,050
Someone who loses sight of their place or what they should do, is disqualified as a leader.

474
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:25,280
You are opposing her because you cannot control her.

475
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:34,630
If the order crumbles, a state of confusion ensues. Not only for MC, it's the same for the world.

476
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:39,680
Then, those many revolutions... How do you explain them?

477
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:44,780
What do you think happened to France who cut the queen's neck? Is it as equal as you think?

478
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:48,020
Yes, well, it's not perfect, but our lives became

479
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:52,000
a lot better than in the past, and will improve more in the future.

480
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:57,290
Standing back up after bumping into a wall, breaking apart or falling down...

481
00:40:57,290 --> 00:40:59,920
This right here is the order of history.

482
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:10,690
This is why I say that you are naive.

483
00:41:10,690 --> 00:41:15,940
As always, we will keep on living in a capitalist world in the future.

484
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:21,450
Capitalism started as a system good for bringing private properties to humankind, but the result today?

485
00:41:21,450 --> 00:41:23,380
The very thing it is built on is inequality.

486
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:28,030
The effort to break this inequality, will also never disappear.

487
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:31,200
The resentment that makes humans human.

488
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:34,810
I'm not giving it up on a retrial.

489
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:41,410
Director Han, if I can't ret rid of you all at once ... Then slowly, little by little,

490
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:45,400
one by one... I will throw my jabs at you.

491
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:48,400
You know, I don't have a strong punch.

492
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:51,290
But I have the strength to throw jabs.

493
00:41:51,290 --> 00:41:55,410
As long as I'm alive, this fight has no reason to stop.

494
00:43:24,550 --> 00:43:26,900
I thought it couldn't be true...

495
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:29,900
But in the end it became like this.

496
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:34,310
Ah really, is there no hope for our society?

497
00:43:34,310 --> 00:43:38,810
Why do people with no power and backing always lose?

498
00:43:38,810 --> 00:43:41,660
I was barely just reinstated, ahhh...

499
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:46,300
At this rate, I never know if I'll be tranferred to traffic.

500
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:51,630
No way... You just got dismissed, she must think this is game over. Would she go all the way?

501
00:43:51,630 --> 00:43:57,480
Comrades. Just for today! Just for today, grant me the opportunity to deviate!

502
00:43:58,220 --> 00:44:02,280
From now on, don't accept any client, and bring us all the alcohol you have here.

503
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:06,330
And bring us all the snacks you have— no, you can make here!

504
00:44:06,330 --> 00:44:09,020
I'll take responsibility for your sales.

505
00:44:10,550 --> 00:44:12,860
Don't go overboard, how will you take care of the aftermath?

506
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:15,990
What is there to life? If it's not about rent it's about the lease deposit.

507
00:44:15,990 --> 00:44:17,340
There's also monthly rent.

508
00:44:17,340 --> 00:44:22,840
There is also a last bastion deep in the mountain. I'm a natural man too, I'll be the protagonist.

509
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:28,590
Didn't we expect this much?

510
00:44:30,170 --> 00:44:33,110
But we do have a reason to drink.

511
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:36,100
- Give me one too. 
 - Over there.

512
00:44:36,150 --> 00:44:38,160
Wait a minute.

513
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:42,590
Hello?

514
00:44:47,970 --> 00:44:50,890
Mo Seok Hui, where are you right now?

515
00:45:11,350 --> 00:45:13,000
Housekeeper Jeong...

516
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,390
Miss.

517
00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:30,500
I guess Seok Hui found out about her identity.

518
00:45:39,030 --> 00:45:41,140
What did you say?

519
00:45:43,610 --> 00:45:46,960
I am... the daughter of Grandfather?

520
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:51,540
I am sorry, Miss... That I am only telling you now.

521
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:57,070
Is this the truth?

522
00:46:02,710 --> 00:46:06,620
My father told be that for a long time

523
00:46:06,620 --> 00:46:10,230
that Grand Chairman didn't have a good relationship with his wife.

524
00:46:10,230 --> 00:46:15,380
In the meantime, he met your birth mother.

525
00:46:18,730 --> 00:46:24,240
Grand Chairman wanted to reveal your identity.

526
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:28,380
But there was the incident of Grand Chairman's wife ending her life,

527
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:33,030
and after that he had a car accident because of Director Han's betrayal.

528
00:46:33,030 --> 00:46:35,790
That's how he lost the chance.

529
00:46:43,590 --> 00:46:50,980
He planned on revealing it proudly when you became the CEO.

530
00:46:52,670 --> 00:46:59,340
But because of his sudden passing... I'm really sorry.

531
00:46:59,340 --> 00:47:06,590
You might be having a hard time to digest this, but this is something you should know.

532
00:47:08,270 --> 00:47:10,720
I am sorry, Miss.

533
00:47:32,590 --> 00:47:34,830
Miss!

534
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:38,780
Then...

535
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:44,230
My mother...

536
00:47:44,230 --> 00:47:47,150
Miss...

537
00:48:00,930 --> 00:48:04,480
 At first I was scared too, 

538
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:07,350
 But I already became fond of her, what can I do. 

539
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:13,710
 Will Director believe you? 

540
00:48:13,710 --> 00:48:19,660
 Thankfully, they are busy on a business trip these days and it's been a while since they've come. 

541
00:48:19,660 --> 00:48:25,470
 I calculated, and it should work if we say I gave birth around next month. 

542
00:48:26,290 --> 00:48:32,270
 Please go back to that house and say that I left. 

543
00:48:32,270 --> 00:48:37,700
 We'll make it look as if I gave birth at the hospital and come back next month. 

544
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:39,880
  I understand.  

545
00:48:45,110 --> 00:48:48,030
  You really like the Chairman's child, don't you? 

546
00:48:48,030 --> 00:48:50,440
  Of course.  

547
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:54,560
 But since the mother passed away, 

548
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:57,230
 she's quite afflicted. 

549
00:48:58,430 --> 00:49:01,350
  She is so pretty.  

550
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:07,240
  I will raise her to be the best child in the world. 

551
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:10,150
  she is like a gift from heaven. 

552
00:49:13,430 --> 00:49:21,550
Grand Chairman  was afraid that you would be shocked, seeing that you were so close to the Madam.

553
00:49:21,550 --> 00:49:24,540
He always worried about that.

554
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:42,170
♫  The night everything fell apart,  ♫

555
00:49:42,170 --> 00:49:45,310
♫  I never go there  ♫

556

560
00:50:07,390 --> 00:50:12,850
♫  Get out of this place  ♫

561
00:50:12,850 --> 00:50:15,640
  Our daughter, what are you upset about?  

562
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:17,960
  The kids are always making fun of me 

563
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:19,620
  because I don't have a father 

564
00:50:19,620 --> 00:50:22,500
  from now on, you will face even more hardships. 

565
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:24,580
  And when that happens, run 

566
00:50:24,580 --> 00:50:28,810
  When you run, the hardships seem to fade and you will feel better. 

567
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:32,100
  - Did you do the same, Mom? 
 - Of course. 

568
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:38,430
 Since you're my daughter, you can also send away your difficulties by running. 

569
00:50:38,430 --> 00:50:43,640
  But Mom, why do we not live with Father? 

570
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:49,420
  Your father is very busy...  

571
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:56,410
  Are you upset that Father is not here?  

572
00:50:56,410 --> 00:50:58,550
  Seok Hui...  

573
00:51:07,050 --> 00:51:09,630
  Our Seok Hee should do whatever she wants to. 

574
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:13,500
  - Really? 
 - Of course.   What would you like to do? 

575
00:51:13,510 --> 00:51:16,330
 My friends went to watch soccer with their dads. 

576
00:51:16,330 --> 00:51:20,010
  Do you want to play soccer with me? 

577
00:51:20,010 --> 00:51:23,600
 You really are Seok Hui, right? 

578
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:26,120
  That's right, I am Seok Hui.  

579
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:29,210
 I don't have any regrets now, even if I die. 

580
00:51:29,210 --> 00:51:34,690

♬   Black Diamond   ♬

587
00:52:10,250 --> 00:52:15,360
♫  Our paradise for just the  two of us  ♫

588
00:52:32,990 --> 00:52:37,010
  You.. shouldn't have been born 

589
00:52:37,010 --> 00:52:39,660
  Is that something to say to your daughter?  

590
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:43,780
 -  I don't have a daughter like you 
  - You're right. 

591
00:52:43,780 --> 00:52:48,250
 Our father-daughter relationship ended 15 years ago when you sent me to the USA. 

592
00:52:48,250 --> 00:52:53,580
  From what I remember, my mom was planning to enter the house before she died. 

593
00:52:53,580 --> 00:52:58,430
  Did you not have any plans to accept us? 

594
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:01,810
  Did you hate Mom to the point of wanting to kill her? 

595
00:53:01,810 --> 00:53:05,670
 Or, did you even love her? 

596
00:53:05,670 --> 00:53:09,370
 Some riddles have several answers. 

597
00:53:34,660 --> 00:53:37,160
Did you know?

598
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,960
That I wasn't your real daughter?

599
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:46,860
My mom deceived you.

600
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:52,850
fooled you. Is that why you hated me, because I wasn't your daughter?

601
00:53:55,720 --> 00:53:57,790
So....

602
00:54:01,970 --> 00:54:09,050
You covered up my mom's death and sent  me ,

603
00:54:10,860 --> 00:54:14,060
at a young age, when I  didn't know anything...

604
00:54:14,060 --> 00:54:17,330
that way to the US?

605
00:54:33,150 --> 00:54:40,280
I am going to find out the truth that no one is telling me about.

606
00:54:59,820 --> 00:55:07,410
The times you spent with your mom... The moments you shared... The love you gave and received...

607
00:55:08,090 --> 00:55:11,130
This is wholly yours, Mo Seok Hui'.

608
00:55:12,290 --> 00:55:17,690
Just because your father changed, doesn't mean your history changes too.

609
00:55:21,430 --> 00:55:24,700
That's why I'm even more thankful for Mom, I think.

610
00:55:37,900 --> 00:55:42,620
At 30 years old, being knocked over because of a birth secret

611
00:55:42,620 --> 00:55:46,200
is so melo, isn't it?

612
00:55:47,490 --> 00:55:53,750
But, if I am Grandfather's daughter, what about my inheritance?

613
00:55:53,750 --> 00:55:59,790
Since you're his direct relative, you legally have the right to receive inheritance, the same as Chairman Mo Cheol Hui.

614
00:55:59,790 --> 00:56:01,590
Is that right?

615
00:56:02,970 --> 00:56:05,550
Then I should go look for my shares.

616
00:56:05,550 --> 00:56:07,500
You'll go look for your shares?

617
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:11,680
Yes, I should do that now.

618
00:56:15,150 --> 00:56:19,160
First of all, as the daughter of the  Gramd Chairman, you put a claim for your legal reserved part as an heir.

619
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:24,320
Then from Chairman Mo's 50% shares, you can take 25%.

620
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:27,660
Plus, from the shares Chaiman Mo donated to his family,

621
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:31,570
you can request half of it, 25% of the 50%.

622
00:56:31,570 --> 00:56:35,370
If it goes like that, can I get more than Mo Wan Joon's shares?

623
00:56:35,370 --> 00:56:39,050
If we check the exact equity structure, we will know right away.

624
00:56:39,050 --> 00:56:41,090
Okay.

625
00:56:41,090 --> 00:56:43,010
If you become the number one shareholder,

626
00:56:43,010 --> 00:56:46,630
there's a way to let go of TOP and send Director Han away.

627
00:56:46,630 --> 00:56:48,650
That was our original  plan.

628
00:56:48,650 --> 00:56:51,580
Anyway, it's worth a try.

629
00:56:55,380 --> 00:56:57,420
Butler Jeong...

630
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:04,690
I'm sorry, Miss,

631
00:57:04,690 --> 00:57:09,800
it seems like Director Han already took the DNA analysis certificate.

632
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:13,500
I realized it later, as I was organizing my things.

633
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:19,050
I had even told you I hid it well...

634
00:57:19,050 --> 00:57:22,230
This is not something you should be sorry for.

635
00:57:26,390 --> 00:57:31,050
That's why she let go easily?

636
00:57:33,910 --> 00:57:38,080
So she means to say that

637
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:39,990
she doesn't care If I am Chairman's daughter or not?

638
00:57:41,890 --> 00:57:44,180
What are you going to do?

639
00:57:44,180 --> 00:57:48,890
Even if I don't have shares, it's a fact that I'm Grandfather's daughter.

640
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:54,840
In a family, we should make our relations clear.

641
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:57,530
To Grandfather...

642
00:57:57,530 --> 00:58:02,640
No, to Father, wouldn't this be good manners?

643
00:58:21,670 --> 00:58:24,260
So, you found out who you were?

644
00:58:24,260 --> 00:58:30,100
Did you think I'd fall down weeping and wailing because my biological father changed?

645
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:39,890
But, Director Han... I think Father had no idea

646
00:58:39,890 --> 00:58:44,610
I was Grand Chairman's daughter...

647
00:58:45,670 --> 00:58:49,020
It seems kind Director Han told him the truth?

648
00:58:49,020 --> 00:58:52,700
It is a fact he should know about.

649
00:58:52,700 --> 00:58:56,200
Of course. You respect facts, Director Han.

650
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:58,760
Although evidently, in front of money even those facts are an exception.

651
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:00,590
It's nice that you're fast at grasping the situation.

652
00:59:00,590 --> 00:59:05,530
Didn't you imagine that Father would be shocked when learning the truth?

653
00:59:06,530 --> 00:59:09,480
Chairman is a strong person.

654
00:59:13,970 --> 00:59:18,520
That's why he fell? Because of a shock.

655
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:21,250
What a strong person.

656
00:59:25,530 --> 00:59:27,820
Anyway, it is shocking.

657
00:59:27,820 --> 00:59:34,290
Every time it's favorable to you, you make someone die or someone else collapse...

658
00:59:34,290 --> 00:59:39,360
It's not times favorable to me, but to MC Group.

659
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:43,130
Anyway, you're quite skillful.

660
00:59:43,930 --> 00:59:47,360
Although we'll have to see until when these skills will work through.

661
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:51,660
Since you have a strong sense of pride, living the way you did until now would be good.

662
00:59:51,660 --> 00:59:53,690
Even if it's for the sake of the family's peace.

663
00:59:53,690 --> 00:59:58,810
No. Peace is only for  those who deserve to enjoy it.

664
00:59:58,810 --> 01:00:02,830
Does the MC family have the right to do so?

665
01:00:04,030 --> 01:00:05,530
So?

666
01:00:05,530 --> 01:00:07,670
I'm also stating the facts.

667
01:00:07,670 --> 01:00:14,400
But, my family should also know the fact that I am grandfather's daughter.

668
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:16,260
Isn't that right?

669
01:00:49,170 --> 01:00:51,910
Here comes Miss Seok Hui.

670
01:01:19,690 --> 01:01:22,660
What are you doing now?

671
01:01:22,660 --> 01:01:26,340
Hasn't Mrs. Han reported to you yet?

672
01:01:26,340 --> 01:01:31,000
I am...the daughter of the grandfather?

673
01:01:32,460 --> 01:01:35,320
You are crazy finally.

674
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:39,730
You've decided to trash our family.

675
01:01:39,730 --> 01:01:44,870
Butler Jeong, what the heck are you doing?

676
01:01:44,870 --> 01:01:48,360
Miss Seok Hui is the daughter of the Grand Chairman.

677
01:01:48,360 --> 01:01:50,270
What?

678
01:02:02,220 --> 01:02:05,980
Butler Jeong, unpack your belongings next to my room on the 2nd floor.

679
01:02:05,980 --> 01:02:08,050
Yes.

680
01:02:17,390 --> 01:02:22,550
Now we need to work on the names. It's a well-built family.

681
01:02:22,550 --> 01:02:26,650
So..should I call you Miss?

682
01:02:26,650 --> 01:02:28,550
Miss?

683
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:33,120
That sounds great, sister-in-law.

684
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:35,280
Sister-in-law?

685
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:46,390
Wait, Seok Hui. What should I call you?

686
01:02:46,390 --> 01:02:47,840
Aunt.

687
01:02:47,840 --> 01:02:50,800
Aunt Seok Hui?

688
01:02:54,260 --> 01:02:58,420
MC family is full of surprises.

689
01:02:58,420 --> 01:03:02,780
Do you know what's the worst curse God has given to humans?

690
01:03:02,780 --> 01:03:07,240
Humans will adjust to any environment.

691
01:03:07,240 --> 01:03:10,030
Even if something is repugnant and awkward for a short while,

692
01:03:10,030 --> 01:03:14,560
we will very naturally get used to it.

693
01:03:21,290 --> 01:03:26,840
Hey, Sister-in-law, isn't the house atmosphere empty?

694
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:33,410
I'm going to call Seo Jin and Seo Jin's mother to make the home sweet home.

695
01:03:35,100 --> 01:03:41,170
If you don't like home sweet home, why don't you move out, Sister-in-law?

696
01:03:41,170 --> 01:03:42,390
Stop!

697
01:03:42,390 --> 01:03:47,790
Nephew. You're so rude to speak informally to your aunt.

698
01:03:47,790 --> 01:03:51,500
You are smart. Get used to it.

699
01:03:51,500 --> 01:03:57,400
Right, what Aunt Seok Hui is saying isn't wrong.

700
01:03:57,400 --> 01:04:02,120
I'm thinking of shooting a film about our family's story.

701
01:04:02,120 --> 01:04:04,540
Isn't it so compelling?

702
01:04:04,540 --> 01:04:07,680
We don't know if we have a younger brother or a younger sister...

703
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:11,760
The person who was a younger sister yesterday is an aunt today.

704
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:15,660
What could change tomorrow?

705
01:04:15,660 --> 01:04:18,090
I don't know.

706
01:04:18,090 --> 01:04:24,170
In the end, the plaintiff and suspect standing in court... Won't that be the finale ?

707
01:04:29,780 --> 01:04:31,050
Whatever..

708
01:04:31,050 --> 01:04:36,650
If you don't like Home Sweet Home Mo Seok Hui style, there's also the solution of going to jail.

709
01:04:36,650 --> 01:04:41,010
Well...You don't have to worry about moving out, then.

710
01:04:49,540 --> 01:04:51,490
It is true.

711
01:04:56,790 --> 01:05:02,260
Director Han, so Grandfather's extramarital child from 30 years ago... that was Seok Hui?

712
01:05:02,260 --> 01:05:03,750
Yes.

713
01:05:06,540 --> 01:05:12,190
Then, isn't Wan Joon's place as a successor also at risk now?

714
01:05:12,190 --> 01:05:16,390
Shut up! Did you come to sit and watch the fire?

715
01:05:17,720 --> 01:05:22,560
That chick Seok Hui... She'll probably jump into the shares battle?

716
01:05:26,950 --> 01:05:31,940
Seems like a surprise rival appeared before Wan Joon's inauguration.

717
01:05:31,940 --> 01:05:36,400
- The alternative? 
 - The situation has not changed in the least.

718
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:37,440
What?

719
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:40,840
Since there is no proof that says she is his daughter.

720
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:43,820
What about Jeong Butler's statement?

721
01:05:43,820 --> 01:05:47,750
Young Master Wan Soo is my son.

722
01:05:47,750 --> 01:05:49,610
What are you going to prove it with?

723
01:05:49,610 --> 01:05:53,720
Without proof, it's only an empty assertion.

724
01:05:55,370 --> 01:05:59,720
So, Director Han, the DNA analysis certificate, you already...

725
01:05:59,720 --> 01:06:01,610
I took care of it.

726
01:06:09,470 --> 01:06:11,780
The inauguration ceremony will proceed as planned.

727
01:06:11,780 --> 01:06:14,130
Yes, that is what should happen.

728
01:06:14,130 --> 01:06:18,360
Director Han, you really work hard.

729
01:06:23,900 --> 01:06:26,590
Then..

730
01:06:33,810 --> 01:06:39,940
Finally, it seems your dream is realized, Mother.

731
01:06:39,940 --> 01:06:41,140
Congratulations.

732
01:06:41,140 --> 01:06:45,380
MC group was originally my son's.

733
01:06:48,110 --> 01:06:50,620
My son's?

734
01:06:52,050 --> 01:06:54,720
Then am I also not you son?

735
01:06:56,280 --> 01:07:00,370
Just because you're a son, doesn't mean you're the same to me.

736
01:07:35,750 --> 01:07:40,270
Then, the era of Mo Wan Joon's MC is starting?

737
01:07:48,630 --> 01:07:50,750
Lawyer Heo..

738
01:08:07,250 --> 01:08:08,050
Ah, you're here.

739
01:08:08,050 --> 01:08:10,560
Why are you so surprised?

740
01:08:13,390 --> 01:08:15,370
My dear Lawyer Heo...

741
01:08:15,370 --> 01:08:20,380
Should we professionally talk about law today?

742
01:08:20,380 --> 01:08:21,910
Talk about law?

743
01:08:21,910 --> 01:08:24,260
Me and Seok Hui...

744
01:08:25,620 --> 01:08:31,350
I mean, Aunt Seok Hui... You know that we're comrades in the revolution, right?

745
01:08:31,350 --> 01:08:34,790
I'm thinking of doing a joint operation together.

746
01:08:34,790 --> 01:08:39,490
The shares that Aunt Seok Hui was deprived of, isn't there a way to get them back?

747
01:08:40,440 --> 01:08:44,060
In that case, we need to start a lawsuit for invalid transfer,

748
01:08:44,060 --> 01:08:48,590
but Miss Mo Seok Hui has to agree and sign... That's a bit difficult.

749
01:08:48,590 --> 01:08:50,560
Is that right?

750
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:55,560
Then, you can claim for her legal portion as Grandfather's heir.

751
01:08:55,560 --> 01:09:01,030
But we don't have a direct proof that she's Grand Chairman's daughter.

752
01:09:05,060 --> 01:09:09,680
Lawyer Heo... You lack a bit of creativity.

753
01:09:09,680 --> 01:09:12,150
Is it because you're too honest?

754
01:09:12,150 --> 01:09:16,480
You know, the coerced transfer from last time... Refer to it!

755
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:21,450
Aunt Seok Hui, she had no choice but to give her shares to Father under coercion.

756
01:09:21,450 --> 01:09:25,350
I can testify to that.

757
01:09:25,350 --> 01:09:29,420
You'll testify that she signed under coercion?

758
01:09:29,420 --> 01:09:31,680
Right.

759
01:09:31,680 --> 01:09:36,980
Isn't that right for all of us?

760
01:09:44,130 --> 01:09:46,310
 MC TOWER 

761
01:09:46,310 --> 01:09:48,360
So?

762
01:09:48,360 --> 01:09:54,340
If Aunt Seok Hee sues for a stake that was forcibly taken away,

763
01:09:54,340 --> 01:09:58,970
it'll get complicated.

764
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:06,450
As you already know, she and I have something special.

765
01:10:06,450 --> 01:10:12,260
I and Aunt Seok Hui, we could also work together to manage the company.

766
01:10:14,820 --> 01:10:16,930
Director Han,

767
01:10:16,930 --> 01:10:24,000
We can give you better results than you expect.

768
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:28,120
It'll be hard to change the heir right this moment,

769
01:10:28,120 --> 01:10:36,100
but there is an alternative, you can give me my 30% back.

770
01:10:39,810 --> 01:10:44,390
You told me to wait for the right moment.

771
01:10:44,390 --> 01:10:48,610
I am ready to wait for however long it takes.

772
01:10:49,350 --> 01:10:54,560
So, for now, 30%, deal?

773
01:10:55,540 --> 01:11:00,420
I told you right? That I like the number 3 quite a lot.

774
01:11:01,290 --> 01:11:04,670
Young Master,

775
01:11:04,670 --> 01:11:11,340
I cannot make you the leader of MC Group

776
01:11:11,340 --> 01:11:14,620
though, I can cover up a murder.

777
01:11:15,610 --> 01:11:17,420
What?

778
01:11:18,940 --> 01:11:23,810
Soek Hui's mom,

779
01:11:24,710 --> 01:11:27,400
you killed her.

780
01:11:45,990 --> 01:11:53,030


781
01:11:53,030 --> 01:11:56,030
♫  Black Diamond  ♫

782
01:11:58,410 --> 01:12:03,880
♫  You and I, to that place  ♫

783
01:12:03,880 --> 01:12:06,650
♫  Black Diamond  ♫

784
01:12:09,370 --> 01:12:14,540
♫  The paradise for just the two of us  ♫

785
01:12:17,740 --> 01:12:19,750
 Graceful family 
 Preview 

786
01:12:19,750 --> 01:12:21,430
Tell us the truth.

787
01:12:21,430 --> 01:12:24,270
However, only Mo Wan Soo doesn't have a motive.

788
01:12:24,270 --> 01:12:26,980
I also would like if you weren't the culprit.

789
01:12:26,980 --> 01:12:29,870
Us two, like other people, we're like family.

790
01:12:29,870 --> 01:12:32,590
I got the evidence, so we should start.

791
01:12:32,590 --> 01:12:34,820
Let's prepare for the inauguration ceremony.

792
01:12:34,820 --> 01:12:36,620
Just a second.

793
01:12:36,620 --> 01:12:38,870
So you were Director Han,

794
01:12:38,870 --> 01:12:40,940
Director Han disappeared? What do you mean by that?

795
01:12:40,940 --> 01:12:47,160
You were the best colleagues. Director Han's era is over.

796
01:12:47,160 --> 01:12:51,300
♫  The shining sunrise  ♫
