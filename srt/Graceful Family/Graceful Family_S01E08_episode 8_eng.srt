00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:56,720
  Miss, Madam said that her head hurts a lot so, she wants you to eat by yourself.  

4
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:07,000
  Ahjumma.  Why does my mom's head always hurt a lot these days?  

5
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,730
  I don't know.  

6
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:14,030
  Ahjumma, let's eat together.  

7
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:18,600
  I don't want to eat alone. Hurry.  

8
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:52,220
 The young girl who is desperate for her mother’s love 

9
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:56,600
  was completely lonely because of a mother who suffered from headaches every day. 

10
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:09,200
 Seok Hui! 

11
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,820
 Mom. 

12
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,980
 Do you want to eat out with mom today? 

13
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:19,690
 Does your head not hurt today? 

14
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:21,800
 No, I'm fine. 

15
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,320
 After a long time, do you wanna go watch a movie? 

16
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,650
 - Really?
 - Of course. 

17
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:43,130
 For some reason, the young girl’s mother’s everyday life was starting to break down little by little. 

18
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:51,990
 Aren’t addictions very common among artists? 

19
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:54,920
 - But madame...
 - Doctor Seol, 

20
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:59,430
 don't you have to get the position of Chief at MC Hospital? 

21
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:05,480
 If she becomes worse, we can move her to the hospital then. 

22
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:12,920
 Disliking someone didn’t end with just one person. 

23
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:30,400
 The girl’s mother became ill, 

24
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:43,430
 and the girl who realized how bitter a grain of rice tastes too young, 

25
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:08,920
 the boy who used to fill the void left by his mother with cheap bread, 

26
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:15,390
 All of these are in pain.

29
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:29,730
- Heo Yoon Do.
 - Yes?

30
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:32,680
Who are you?

31
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,620
What?

32
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:36,330
Are you really Heo Yoon Do?

33
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:40,670
What do you mean by that?

34
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:42,750
Do you really not know what I'm talking about?

35
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,760
Did you do a background check on me?

36
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,900
Though I'm your employee, doing a background check on me is against the law.

37
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:53,230
Look here.

38
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:56,470
Paying you an annual salary in the hundreds of millions of won means you have to

39
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:58,520
completely bear your soul as well as your subconscious to us.

40
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,690
Don't pretend like you didn't know like you were naive.

41
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:04,860
There isn't a member on our team who hasn't aired out their messy family history.

42
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:10,270
Anyways. Explain to me why Heo Yoon Do, whose funeral has already been completed, is standing in front of me.

43
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:11,540
I was adopted.

44
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:13,050
And before you were adopted?

45
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:14,920
Must I tell you all the miserable details?

46
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:18,290
Of course, because I have to know everything about you.

47
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:20,350
I don't remember.

48
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:25,020
All I remember is that one day when I opened my eyes, I was in the house of my current father.

49
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:28,760
And my father who had lost a son decided to take me in as his own.

50
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:33,070
So we became father and son and have been living well till now.

51
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:37,770
I too, am curious about my childhood.

52
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:41,290
Is that enough?

53
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,440
Alright, go out.

54
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:50,510
How Lawyer Heo grew up, what work you did,

55
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:53,900
It isn't a hindrance to working at TOP.

56
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:58,140
I'm so thankful, I'm touched, Director.

57
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:26,310
Good thing I ran into you.

58
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:29,100
My head hurts, so can you suggest a medicine for me to take?

59
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:33,090
- Why would you ask me for it? 
 - Since you were a nurse.

60
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:36,960
I wasn't as competent of a nurse as you might think.

61
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:42,560
I see. So that's why you threw away your profession and came into a wealthy family as the mistress.

62
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:46,280
I know that you don't really like me,

63
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,830
but is there a reason we should be getting heated and

64
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:52,120
fight like this, tooth and nail?

65
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,760
It's not good for your mental state either.

66
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:58,090
How about you get out of the house?

67
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:00,470
You can live independently.

68
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:02,600
To make whom happy?

69
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:06,230
When you see me, don't you naturally lose weight?

70
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:08,890
It's nice since you don't have to go on a diet.

71
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:14,260
I like that I can eat away at someone's 'average' lifespan.

72
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:18,360
Why would I leave the house when there is such a good environment?

73
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:36,700
  The doctor said that the  

74
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:39,800
  Songbuk-dong madam ordered her to do so.  

75
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,230
Ha Yeong Seo...

76
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:46,930
You wanted to kill my mom since a long time ago, right?

77
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:56,920
I'll take the documents that Lawyer Heo brought and go meet Choi Na Ri.

78
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:59,230
- What about the Baek Soo Jin plan? 
  - Yes, it's moving forward.

79
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:01,370
Team leader Yoon, you take care of it.

80
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:03,150
- Lawyer Heo. 
 - Yes?

81
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:06,870
Take charge of preventing the Assembly from amending the Inheritance Act.

82
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:11,430
Will you be able to do it?

83
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,060
Of course. After I review the materials, I'll report to you with a plan.

84
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:19,560
Nice. You, give him access to the main PC.

85
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,830
Yes.

86
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:22,660
Then, work hard.

94
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:41,300
Director Han, I told you to bring the contract by today, didn't I?

95
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:46,380
But what kind of situation is this, not even picking up the phone?

96
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:51,870
You know I'm short tempered... Why are you being like this?!

97
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:53,530
Seriously!

98
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,620
Step out for a moment.

99
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:24,000
Why don't we keep our promises if at all possible, huh?

100
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,280
You brought the contract right?

101
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,460
I don't have it.

102
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:32,370
What are you saying?

103
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:36,170
You received an anti-aging blood transfusion didn't you? Even while knowing that it was illegal,

104
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:40,470
actress Choi Na Ri received blood transfusions from younger people for the purpose of beauty.

105
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:44,950
If that is revealed, what do you think will happen?

106
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:51,520
Well, that's because I wasn't feeling so well. I'm telling you it wasn't for the sake of beauty.

107
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:54,240
Unfortunately, regardless, blood transfusions

108
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,020
are medical treatments that also hasn't been approved by the FDA in the US.

109
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:02,450
Also, why did you drag Seo Jin around? Is he your alibi?

110
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:08,100
Director Han, what's wrong with you?

111
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,790
Given our relationship, I'm disappointed with you.

112
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:16,130
I mean, what is such a big problem with getting some blood transfusions from young people?

113
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:19,480
It's not even like I harmed anyone.

114
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,790
And also, am I the only one who got it?

115
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:24,720
These days, all the celebrities are doing it!

116
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:29,600
A total of 12 times. You received illegal blood transfusion treatments habitually,

117
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:34,370
and you also took a minor to the site of the illegal treatments.

118
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:39,130
Should I release it to the news outlets?

119
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:40,590
Really?

120
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:44,590
Then, do that,

121
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:49,850
but, you know that only the doctors get punished, right?

122
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:52,510
I'm not eligible for punishment.

123
00:11:55,060 --> 00:12:01,360
If you want to bring me down, you'll have to reveal who Seo Jin's father is.

124
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:07,980
Okay sure. Why don't you reveal it and we can all die together. Reveal it!

125
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:15,500
Yesterday, I heard at the filming location something along the lines of

126
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:19,010
a battle is only a battle when I'm the only one experiencing it.

127
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:23,930
If everyone experiences it, it's not even considered a battle.

128
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:30,270
So, you'll continue onward?

129
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:32,380
If you are going to end me,

130
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:38,160
Chairman would also have to reveal everything. Will that be possible?

131
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,520
Whatever it is, you are going to handle it?

132
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:44,060
Whatever situation it may be?

133
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:49,260
Of course. We share a common destiny.

134
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:51,890
It's not me first.

135
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:59,200
I'm busy with filming now. Now, then.

136
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:15,880
How did they know that I had the transfusion?

137
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:21,160
Seriously, that viper. She gives me chills.

138
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:24,420
Did she think I'd be affected by that?

139
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:40,790
Is that a water ghost tactic? (if you're going down, drag everyone down with you) She's coming out stronger than expected.

140
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:45,970
So I'm thinking, why don't we completely get rid of her?

141
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:50,460
What about our risk? It might be fatal to the Chairman or to the group.

142
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:53,250
- Why do you only know one thing, instead of two?
 - Pardon?

143
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:56,410
Why do you think I called you over separately, Team Leader Lee?

144
00:13:57,460 --> 00:14:02,160
Let's carefully just pluck out Choi Na Ri with some tweezers.

145
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:06,280
- It's possible, right? 
 - It has to be.

146
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:09,090
Why don't you take care of this?

147
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:10,490
Yes.

148
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:16,850
Why would they go to to the prison together?

149
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:18,910
Mo Seok Hui was kicked out from the CEO position

150
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:22,200
and now has started to dig into a murder case from 15 years ago.

151
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:25,100
Did you find out about Lawyer Heo?

152
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:29,740
I even went to the pork rib restaurant and put out some traps but haven't had any success.

153
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:32,050
Did I wrongly mistake him as a classmate?

154
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:36,990
And he is with TOP but is working with Seok Hui.

155
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:40,600
Maybe they are dating? So, for the sake of the woman he loves, he will stop at nothing?

156
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:44,820
Sometimes you just cut the flow of thought. You must feel blessed to have so many emotions.

157
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,780
Ah, my head hurts.

158
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:52,390
Anyway, today is Choi Na Ri's movie awards. Do you think she'll get 10 million this time, too?

159
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:56,430
She's possessed as an actress. (amazingly talented) The male lead is good, to, so I'm sure they'll get 10 million.

160
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:59,550
How did Choi Na RI survive without a single scandal?

161
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:03,210
Whether she doesn't have one or is hiding it well is something we don't know about.

162
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:06,890
I guess. I heard her personality is terrible.

163
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:10,700
It'd be awesome if we just got our hands on one scandal.

164
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:13,000
- Why don't you try poking over there? 
 - Where?

165
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,080
TOP's Lee Gyeong Ah. TOP is at the government level. Maybe she'll have some dirt on Choi Na Ri.

166
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,310
You're saying something equivalent to Bill Gates getting a loan. (ridiculous)

167
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:21,670
You know who she is. Do you think she is the type to give out information so easily?

168
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:24,400
Also, I should use her for something bigger this time.

169
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:27,630
Makes sense. She looked rude and so cocky.

170
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:29,690
She does sort of looks that way, right?

171
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:32,160
Hi, you two!

172
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,670
What is this atmosphere?

173
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:38,760
Perhaps, were you guys just talking about me?

174
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:41,380
No, we were talking about Bill Gates' loan.

175
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:43,930
Wondering how large of a loan interest Bill Gates pays.

176
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:49,990
Whatever. I brought a huge scoop. But all of a sudden, I don't feel like handing it over.

177
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,510
Step out for a bit.

178
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:59,960
Ah, I'll go to the award ceremony first.

179
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,160
I thought you said you were not going to the award ceremony.

180
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,970
- I'm going now. 
 - Speed it up.

181
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:07,850
Right. Yes.

182
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:12,460
I'm leaving.

183
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,440
What is it? The huge scoop?

184
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:20,260
Remember I said that I would provide you with three exclusives, last time we made that deal.

185
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:22,860
You have changed a lot. Now you even know to keep a promise.

186
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:26,990
It's no use to us but I thought it'd be a huge deal to you so I brought it.

187
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:33,220
 Article about Choi Na Ri 

188
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,190
Is this true?

189
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:41,050
If your company shuts down because of wrong information, I'd have to buy drinks and food and such. That would be so tiring for me.

190
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:43,470
This is a nuclear bomb.

191
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:47,560
I'm seriously so touched. Lee Gyeong Ah, you seriously are the best. The best.

192
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:50,760
My Gyeong Ah, I don't want you to become dirty.

193
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:57,150
It's not enough that she received illegal blood transfusions

194
00:16:57,150 --> 00:17:01,320
from young people, but she is a mother, too? Who is her man?

195
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,880
The target is Choi Na Ri so don't try to be curious or investigate other things.

196
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,190
But why is TOP getting involved?

197
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:10,180
She's always nagging about her exclusive modeling fee.   It's annoying for me.

198
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:11,820
Is that all?

199
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:17,400
If you become any more curious, I'll really make you close this company down.

200
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:21,020
Let's restrain ourselves, okay?

201
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:24,130
I'm restraining myself a lot, okay?

202
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:27,400
I'll leave.

203
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,620
Thank you, thank you.

204
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,930
Gwang Mi, the award ceremony isn't even important.

205
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:45,570
The boats have finally arrived off the coast at Incheon. And it's a BIG ship, at that.

206
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:48,490
We need to row, we need to row.

207
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:51,980
Are you rowing? Hurry up and row!

208
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,760
  Actress Choi Na Ri, revealed to have a middle school-age son, shock. 

209
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,150
  Actress Choi Na Ri, illegal blood transfusion 

210
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,430
Turn the car around.

211
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:38,120
Team Leader Kwon is on the way here.

212
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:07,130
 Breaking news, we just found out that actress Choi Na Ri 

213
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:10,390
 has been hiding the fact that she has a middle school-aged son. 

214
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:14,030
 Choi Na Ri has told the public that she is single until now. 

215
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:17,180
 and it has been confirmed that she is legally unmarried. 

216
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:20,000
 It is predicted that the scandal will expand 

217
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,510
  if it is confirmed that she had a son out of wedlock. 

218
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:27,690
I got it, I'll call you later.

219
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:34,120
Noona, the cell phone and laptop both don't work. They are both dead. Why is this?

220
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:37,120
The school is also saying that I need to transfer. Did I do something wrong?

221
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,590
Why is this suddenly happening?

222
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:53,690
The Choi Na Ri issue has overshadowed all political issues.

223
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:56,960
It has risen as the most shocking celebrity news in the past 5 years.

224
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,060
If this is the situation, it will be impossible for her to make a comeback right?

225
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:02,790
Once the witch hunt subsides, the direction of questioning will change to who the child's father is.

226
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:07,120
We're in the process of directing that towards the celebrities she had flings with as well as her acquaintances.

227
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,300
You did well.

228
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:12,460
There is already an opinion that the son should be protected since he is a victim.

229
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:14,780
We have blocked all of Seo Jin's friends.

230
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:18,600
Okay. Let's use this opportunity to clean Seo Jin's surroundings as well.

231
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,680
Yes, I understand.

232
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:29,360
Director Han, is this how you're going to take a swing at me?

233
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:33,220
You all go out.

234
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,370
Do you think I'll step back because of this?

235
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:56,520
I'll hold a press conference and will reveal in detail who Seo Jin's father is.

236
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:59,300
I ... am not going down alone.

237
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:02,750
What are we going to do given that such a hot star hasn't figured out her situation?

238
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:05,440
The DNA test showed that he...

239
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,560
isn't Chairman Mo's son.

240
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:11,630
That's because you guys fabricated it!

241
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:16,060
The second you mention the Chairman's name, you'll go to prison for libel.

242
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:18,590
Do you still want to have a press conference?

243
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:33,050
Just die!!!

244
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,930
Director Han...

245
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:50,250
No, Director Han, Ma'am,

246
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:51,770
Please help me.

247
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:53,830
First, I'll waive any inheritance.

248
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:57,910
Please help me remain an actress. Huh?

249
00:21:57,910 --> 00:22:02,500
I'll do anything that you ask.

250
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:05,210
That's why please....

251
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:09,870
Spare me. I can do anything you ask of me.

252
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:13,790
You can do it.

253
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:18,950
Please.  Please save me.

254
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:22,770
It's too late for us to become friends.

255
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:31,250
You spiteful bitch!

256
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:34,580
You think you can tear me down?

257
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:38,060
I.... am Choi Na Ri.

258
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:40,470
Choi Na Ri!!

259
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:19,040
You guys are really eating well..

260
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:22,200
You turn Seo Jin's mom's life into a mess.

261
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:25,070
Aren't you eating too well?

262
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,890
Seo Jin, do you want to go to school overseas?

263
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:31,450
Do I have to go?

264
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:33,850
Wouldn't you feel more comfortable with that?

265
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:37,680
- I don't want to. 
 - Right, Seo Jin,  don't go.

266
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:40,560
You shouldn't send a kid overseas if he doesn't want to.

267
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:44,120
That's not humanity.

268
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,850
You ... do what you want to.

269
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:48,540
Really?

270
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:51,850
He's  a defective product which can't even be returned.

271
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:01,670
If you repair a defective product, you can use it.

272
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:09,630
Who lives in this house doing as he pleases?

273
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:14,230
What do you want to do Sister-in-law, do what you want to.

274
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:18,520
Go when we are sending you, that way everyone will be happy.

275
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:23,080
I don't care if you get married three times or have a hundred kids.

276
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:27,870
But isn't this very cowardly? We are talking about Seo Jin's mom.

277
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:30,460
Fine, so you don't want to take responsibility,

278
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:32,560
Don't you have any compassion?

279
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:35,870
The meat is very well aged.

280
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:39,580
We reduced the amount of salt, but it's pretty good, isn't it?

281
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:44,950
Seo Jin, do you know what they call kids like you?

282
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:52,460
EX-TRA-MA-RI-TAL child.

283
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:01,040
You can resent your mom,

284
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:05,000
but you becoming an extramarital child is not only your mom's fault.

285
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:10,010
Dad is responsible for it just as much.

286
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,170
No, that's not true.

287
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:16,100
For cheating, Dad's responsibility is greater.

288
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:22,370
You shouldn't live cowardly like Dad. Do you understand?

289
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:30,970
Why do you live?

290
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:37,080
Why do you live, father?

291
00:25:37,810 --> 00:25:40,400
For MC Group.

292
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:50,340
Chairman, Director Han is here.

293
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:04,390
Seok Hui, do you know why I live?

294
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:07,740
I.....

295
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:11,620
live for art.

296
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:13,890
Seok Hui, what are you going to be when you grow up that you're like that?

297
00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:16,690
- What are you going to be when you grow older? (informal speech) 
 - What?!

298
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:20,470
Why don't you stop pretending like you're elegant when it doesn't suit you and show your true colors?

299
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:25,700
Mo Seok Hui. Stop it.  No matter how angry you are, what's this to Mom?

300
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:28,540
Please give it a break now, Miss.

301
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:31,610
It would have been better if you were in prison instead.

302
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:37,990
Do you think... that this house is any better than prison?

303
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:05,770
Choi Na Ri situation will be handled by her going through retirement.

304
00:27:05,770 --> 00:27:10,150
In exchange, we have completely prevented any chance of  Seo Jin getting shares.

305
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:15,460
- Chairman? 
 - Let her retire

306
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:19,700
and live quietly.

307
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:24,230
Director Han,

308
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:30,030
what do you live for?

309
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:38,850
Do you think I am too harsh to my family?

310
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:42,480
There is no life which can satisfy everyone.

311
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,780
Take a rest.

312
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:09,490
It's a world where even the President has a second term after a sex scandal broke out.

313
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:11,490
What are you afraid of?

314
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:17,990
It is my job to to keep scandals under control.

315
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:24,700
Director Han is a coward.

316
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:29,700
Hiding a truth is not an ability but cheating.

317
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:34,030
Do you enjoy winning against a helpless woman and a child?

318
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:42,400
But then again, women who are dying to become men are worse.

319
00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:49,780
When Seo Jin's father is revealed,

320
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:54,430
it'd be your duty then to protect Chairman Mo.

321
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:59,760
That is when you should show your abilities.

322
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,670
Han Je Gook.

323
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:16,280
 A Korean actress told a huge lie to everyone. 

324
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:18,310
 It's clearly deception. Deception. 

325
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:23,230
 How can the mother of a middle school student pretend she is single? 

326
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:26,870
Why? Let's watch more.

327
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:29,650
Don't bother. Not like it's happy news.

328
00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:33,900
You must be upset because you were her fan.

329
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:35,430
What do you mean upset?

330
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:39,480
For me, I always felt that she was strange.

331
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,740
In any case, my intuition is never wrong.

332
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:45,800
By the way, what is our Na Ri going to do now?

333
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:48,450
Father, that woman,

334
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:51,400
she's earned enough money to live on for the rest of her life.

335
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:55,700
Is this a time for you to be worrying about Choi Na Ri? Today there was only 200,000 won in sales.

336
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:58,690
Why do you always obsess over money?

337
00:29:58,690 --> 00:30:01,560
These days money is tight for young people.

338
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,780
It's not my fault, it's because I was born into the wrong generation.

339
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:07,670
The way you speak...whenever you open your mouth

340
00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:10,380
it just flows out of your mouth so eloquently, seriously...

341
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:15,080
If I can't speak, what would I live for when nothing I do works out?

342
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:18,130
I'm back.

343
00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:21,190
Oh, son, come here.

344
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:24,180
- Why are you still here? 
 - I waited so I can see you before I go.

345
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:25,830
Why? Do you have something to say to me?

346
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:27,920
Today... all day,

347
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:31,070
your dad couldn't couldn't get a grip because of Choi Na Ri.

348
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:36,210
You must've been sad because of Choi Na Ri today.

349
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:39,830
But, is it true that she has a son that's middle school age?

350
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:42,770
I can't say.  The whole country is talking about it.

351
00:30:42,770 --> 00:30:44,650
Who is the father of the child?

352
00:30:44,650 --> 00:30:46,180
How would I know that?

353
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:50,340
- I heard that big companies are well informed about gossip news. 
 - That isn't so.

354
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:54,200
Even if other people speak ill of her, I can't.

355
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,200
I'm sure she had a situation.

356
00:30:56,200 --> 00:31:00,090
After being so happy to be someone's fan, turning your back on them

357
00:31:00,090 --> 00:31:03,500
when something bad happens, you shouldn't be like that.

358
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,030
That's lack of loyalty.

359
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:07,980
Anyway, you can be sure he's brimming over with compassion.

360
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:11,150
Isn't that my father's weak point and strong point?

361
00:31:11,150 --> 00:31:14,300
Then, why don't you show me some of that compassion?

362
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:17,540
I'm a lot worse off than Choi Na Ri!

363
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:23,180
Mr. Heo, have you been well?

364
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:26,400
- Yes. 
 - Hyungnim, you came?

365
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:30,880
Fifteen years ago in MC Hospital, it turns out there was a doctor named Seol Mi Kyeong.

366
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,700
- Really? 
 - Yes.

367
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:36,530
But some time after the murder case, she quit.

368
00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:39,730
- And when I looked into her after that point, something was weird.
 - What is?

369
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:42,520
She's working as a doctor of Oriental medicine in Yeongdeungpo now.

370
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:45,270
Why is an internal medicine doctor running an Oriental medicine clinic?

371
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:47,120
Exactly.

372
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:50,400
I have no sense of whether it's that person or not.

373
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:56,480
Oh, this is the doctor's background and the address of her clinic.

374
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,370
I'll have to meet her and see.

375
00:31:58,370 --> 00:32:00,850
But, will you really be able to do this?

376
00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:03,230
You haven't been able to find the investigation report yet, right?

377
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:05,520
Not at TOP, it seems like.

378
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,300
I don't know if this will be of help,

379
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:11,800
but meticulous people like Director Han might not keep an important document in digital form.

380
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:16,120
She would know better than anyone that it could be compromised through hacking, copying, and cloning.

381
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:20,830
That's true. Then that means she'd be keeping it in paper format...

382
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:23,580
Anyway, try harder.

383
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:28,230
Hyungnim, you need to solve this case and get promoted, too.

384
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:29,850
Promotion isn't the issue.

385
00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:33,250
It's a matter which concerns you and your mother's life.

386
00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:36,640
Thank you.

387
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:39,390
What is there to be thankful for? I'm going.

388
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:06,250
My head...

389
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:13,790
How is it now? Would I be able to come home now?

390
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:18,800
What? There are even more reporters now?

391
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:22,230
Okay...

392
00:33:28,810 --> 00:33:31,710
  Confirmation of termination of advertising contract 

393
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:33,420
 Notice of termination of appearance contract 

394
00:33:35,370 --> 00:33:38,880
And he used to beg me to appear all the time!

395
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:47,090
So, it means everything is over, right?

396
00:33:49,170 --> 00:33:50,940
Yes.

397
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:03,580
Seo Jin, I'm sorry.

398
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:44,800
- Turn it on. 
  - Yes.

399
00:34:44,850 --> 00:34:46,240
  TOP  

400
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:51,330
 The father of actress Choi Na Ri's son is Chairman Mo Cheol Hee of MC. 

401
00:34:51,330 --> 00:34:55,620
 Ah... it's really a shocking news. 

402
00:34:55,620 --> 00:35:00,630
 Why are you telling us this even though he is your family? 

403
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:03,310
 It's not fair to criticize Choi Na Ra alone. 

404
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:05,890
 Although perhaps she is avoiding it. 

405
00:35:05,890 --> 00:35:09,050
 But why does she have to deal alone with it when two people are responsible?  

406
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:12,940
 A witch hunt isn't right just because she's an actress. 

407
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:15,350
 If what you are saying is true, 

408
00:35:15,350 --> 00:35:19,360
 I predict there will be great social repercussions.  

409
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:23,800
 I'm sure it will also hurt MC Group's image as well as a direct effect on their stock-- 

410
00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:34,970
- Team leader Lee. -
  Yes.

411
00:35:34,970 --> 00:35:37,200
Tell every news outlet.

412
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,570
The moment follow-up report comes out, all of MC Group's ads will be pulled.

413
00:35:40,570 --> 00:35:41,690
I understand.

414
00:35:41,690 --> 00:35:44,580
Keep your eyes on Seok Hui 24/7 from now on.

415
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:46,300
Yes.

416
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:48,250
- Locate the family members  
 - Yes.

417
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:50,670
- Put the mansion staff on an emergency standby. 
 - Yes.

418
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:53,400
Tomorrow morning, we will have a press conference.  Distribute a press release.

419
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:58,300
- A press conference?  
 - Why? Do you expect me to go to battle without bullets?

420
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:08,390
  Director Han is very cowardly.  

421
00:36:09,310 --> 00:36:13,000
  When Seo Jin's father is revealed,  

422
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:17,220
  It'd be your duty then to protect chairman Mo. 

423
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:20,580
  That is when you should show your abilities.  

424
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:22,680
  Han Je Gook.  

425
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:33,110
- Thank you. 
 - Good job.

426
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:34,590
Oh.

427
00:36:38,290 --> 00:36:40,240
What are you doing?

428
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:42,700
- I could ask the same. 
 - Why?

429
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:45,470
Weren't you serious when you told me you wanted to catch the real culprit? 
 - What are you saying?

430
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:48,320
- Weren't we on the same team? 
 -  So what did I do wrong?

431
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,570
You said you were intelligent and had been preparing for 5 years.

432
00:36:50,570 --> 00:36:53,060
And you make it turn out like this?

433
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:55,150
If we were on the same team, you should've consulted with me.

434
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:58,390
If you go around causing trouble, you think TOP would do nothing about it?

435
00:36:58,390 --> 00:37:01,990
When are you going to catch the real culprit, they are going to tide your hands and feet.

436
00:37:01,990 --> 00:37:06,050
Director Han said you should be watched 24/7.

437
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:11,650
Honestly,  I'm not sure what your real goal is.

438
00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:15,270
Weren't you going to take back your share, and finding the murderer was just an excuse?

439
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:16,520
Heo Yoon Do!

440
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:19,240
The Mo Hui Seok who changed housekeeper every week and didn't trust even the lawyer

441
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:22,360
who got her out of detention, the Mo Seok Hui with OCD to damage, where did she go?

442
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:24,910
Sorry for not consulting with you though we are on the same team.

443
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:27,030
You would have disagreed with me even if I sought your advice.

444
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:30,890
But cancel what you just said, because of my share.

445
00:37:30,890 --> 00:37:33,070
It's insulting.

446
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:35,270
Were you always like this?

447
00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:38,470
You said you are a people lawyer, people matter.

448
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:41,470
Do you not see Seo Jin who got hurt?

449
00:37:42,410 --> 00:37:45,990
Goal is important, but don't get me wrong.

450
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:48,520
You pretend to be TOP, but you are not real TOP.

451
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:52,240
Don't be a monster when catching the monster.

452
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,500
Your way is not always right.

453
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:56,860
Don't provoke TOP anymore.

454
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:59,500
Attitude is essential.

455
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,360
I am sorry.

456
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:32,620
You know that it's harder for the person receiving an apology than for the person offering it, right?

457
00:38:37,610 --> 00:38:43,230
Looking at Seo Jin, I saw myself when I was a child.

458
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:50,000
Also, I can forgive a cheater but can't forgive a coward.

459
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,320
No matter who it is.

460
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:59,640
What can I do?  That's my style.

461
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:17,220
No matter how good the appetite, you must control it.

462
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:21,300
Isn't it common sense that eating whatever you want gives you a stomachache?

463
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:25,020
When you had perfectly fine sons,

464
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:28,490
I guess you wanted to create a family basketball team?

465
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,880
Director Han is here.

466
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:48,090
Director Han, do you have an inability to make decisions?

467
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:51,100
You're good at everything else.

468
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:53,940
Why can't you separate that trash Seok Hui?

469
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:56,570
Is it that you won't or you can't?

470
00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:14,980
Tomorrow morning, we are having a press conference.

471
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,400
- A press conference? 
 - Yes.

472
00:40:20,110 --> 00:40:22,810
A press conference you say...

473
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,930
Starting now, we will announce the MC Group

474
00:40:39,930 --> 00:40:43,700
position on the actress Choi Na Ri.

475
00:40:58,510 --> 00:41:02,460
There are many of you here.  Nice to see you.

476
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:05,020
As some of you may know,

477
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:08,760
I'm the oldest son of the MC Group, Mo Wan Soo.

478
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:15,430
Are you wondering why I am here today?

479
00:41:15,430 --> 00:41:20,240
I am the father of Choi Na Ri's child.

480
00:41:25,530 --> 00:41:27,440
I will accept one question at a time.

481
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:30,960
Could you repeat what you just said?

482
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,750
I will repeat what I just said.

483
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:38,710
I am the father of Choi Na Ri's child. 
  MC Group's eldest son Mo Wan Soo admits he's Choi Na Ri's child's father. 

484
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:47,760
Is this Father's doing?

485
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:54,600
In any case,  that woman Director Han is very ingenious.

486
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:57,280
Who is my real father?

487
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:00,730
What do you mean? It's me!

488
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:18,200
And am I really your daughter?

489
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:26,920
 Why did you hide the truth of your relationship when you are single? 

490
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:28,980
My family was against us being in a relationship.

491
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:34,920
But we conceived a child, and during that time, there was a talk going on of a marriage prospect with someone else,

492
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:38,810
so my father accepted him as his son.

493
00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:43,770
Don't you think he's an amazing person, everyone?

494
00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:46,430
Then was your sister Mo Seok Hui mistaken in her interview?

495
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:49,190
Did your family not know either?

496
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:53,640
Well, our family doesn't tend to meddle in each others' personal lives.

497
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:55,960
So she might not have known.

498
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:58,170
Is there any other question?

499
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:04,830
Yes here, the attractive female reporter.

500
00:43:04,830 --> 00:43:07,690
Since when have you and Choi Na Ri been dating?

501
00:43:07,690 --> 00:43:11,480
Yes, she and I ...

502
00:43:25,070 --> 00:43:32,500
I officially... became a father in order to save MC Group.

503
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:34,930
Take a look.

504
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:41,690
Thirty per cent share.

505
00:43:42,930 --> 00:43:45,210
It's not bad.

506
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:51,060
But what can I do with this?

507
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:55,010
You will have a casting mode role at MC Group.

508
00:43:57,150 --> 00:44:03,780
Then, will I also be able to confront Wan Joon punk, too?

509
00:44:05,550 --> 00:44:07,720
Nice.

510
00:44:09,390 --> 00:44:13,350
He's my younger brother but he is a real jerk.

511
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:19,450
By the way, you have to first resolve the problem of the suspension of the movie.

512
00:44:19,450 --> 00:44:21,580
Of course.

513
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:27,060
Director Han is a good judge of people.

514
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:31,480
I really like competent people like you.

515
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:39,800
And the number 30 is very attractive.  Good.

516
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:51,840
It was cleaned up by framing Choi Na Ri as a gold digger

517
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:55,290
and the MC Group and Mo Wan Soo as a warm and responsible chaebol family.

518
00:44:55,290 --> 00:44:56,330
It's a good frame.

519
00:44:56,330 --> 00:44:58,370
Share prices increased by 5 % too.

520
00:44:58,370 --> 00:45:01,610
Choi Na Ri's contracts for commercials, movies and dramas have all been terminated.

521
00:45:01,610 --> 00:45:03,860
She  is presently in seclusion.

522
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:08,890
But then, won't women's groups get involved to protect Choi Na Ri?

523
00:45:10,090 --> 00:45:13,460
Don't you understand the term "selective justice?"

524
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:17,570
You think that the women's groups will get involved in every woman's issue, right? No.

525
00:45:17,570 --> 00:45:23,300
They also only get involved when there's a political advantage. Do you know how much we donate to that group

526
00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:27,110
Now, we have resolved the Choi Na Ri issue. What about Baek Soo Jin?

527
00:45:27,110 --> 00:45:29,880
It's going as planned.

528
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:33,030
Hello.

529
00:45:34,870 --> 00:45:37,130
You were surprised, right?

530
00:45:37,130 --> 00:45:38,280
I mean... Where's Teacher Han?

531
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:41,740
Oh, Chef Han has suddenly been transferred as the personal chef for  international personnel,

532
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:43,870
so I am taking over your class.

533
00:45:43,870 --> 00:45:45,900
I'm Chef Kim Min Ha.

534
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:48,570
I see, yes. Chef Kim.

535
00:45:48,570 --> 00:45:51,360
I saw that you were moving on from the beginner stage of Italian cuisine.

536
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:55,760
Then today, we'll make a seafood stew.

537
00:45:58,910 --> 00:46:01,310
You're very beautiful.

538
00:46:03,650 --> 00:46:06,650
Then, should we start?

539
00:46:06,650 --> 00:46:09,890
Let's cut the onions first.

540
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:27,170
Madam Baek Soo Jin will take a bit longer, but there shouldn't be any problems.

541
00:46:27,170 --> 00:46:28,070
Okay.

542
00:46:28,070 --> 00:46:30,390
What about Madam Heo Yeong Seoh?

543
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:35,430
 MC Tech Equity Structure Adjustment Plan  

544
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:39,270
Really, what are you doing?

545
00:46:39,270 --> 00:46:42,850
Without your cooperation, Director's Mo succession will be difficult.

546
00:46:42,850 --> 00:46:48,140
Master Mo Wan Joon owning MC Group is your life-long wish, isn't it?

547
00:46:48,140 --> 00:46:51,400
You have to make a decision with a broad viewpoint.

548
00:46:55,090 --> 00:46:58,520
Director Han, then let's do this.

549
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:03,470
Put in a clause to readjust my shares within three years of Wan Joon's succession.

550
00:47:03,470 --> 00:47:08,100
And hand me over the museum. Happy?

551
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:09,540
Let's do that then.

552
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:14,330
In any case, please take good care of our Wan Joon.

553
00:47:15,910 --> 00:47:20,660
Now all of Miss Seok Hui's shares was transferred over to the Chairman, so if we transfer all of his shares to

554
00:47:20,660 --> 00:47:23,090
Director Mo, he'll become the major shareholder.

555
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:26,410
Of course, provided that we put a stop to the revision of the inheritance law becoming effective.

556
00:47:26,410 --> 00:47:28,380
Lawyer Heo, are you ready?

557
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:30,170
Yes.

558
00:47:32,210 --> 00:47:36,100
Out of the 15 assemblymen, we only need to influence just four of them.

559
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:37,860
Two from the ruling party and two from the opposition party.

560
00:47:37,860 --> 00:47:38,760
And the method?

561
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:43,000
It's a little difficult since they don't share the same political views and dispositions--

562
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,620
So what's the alternative?

563
00:47:44,620 --> 00:47:48,350
Having looked into the assembly and regional seminars and conferences,

564
00:47:48,350 --> 00:47:50,230
they have two interests.

565
00:47:50,230 --> 00:47:52,300
First, local self-government,

566
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:55,250
and second, pro-American time.

567
00:47:55,250 --> 00:47:59,950
The funny thing is, every time the two members of the opposition party went to the US, they went to clubs.

568
00:47:59,950 --> 00:48:05,730
And the other two as well, they were both educated in the States, so they are pro-American in that sense as well.

569
00:48:05,730 --> 00:48:07,160
I mean, going to clubs aren't illegal though?

570
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:08,690
Of course not,

571
00:48:08,690 --> 00:48:12,580
but it's a different story when they frequent adult clubs.

572
00:48:12,580 --> 00:48:16,080
Using a seminar tour of US' local government systems as bait,

573
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:18,350
we invite four assemblymen to the States?

574
00:48:18,350 --> 00:48:19,580
Bingo.

575
00:48:19,580 --> 00:48:23,170
But the seminar is just a formality.

576
00:48:48,410 --> 00:48:50,520
That's original.

577
00:48:51,270 --> 00:48:53,660
Isn't it boring to end it there?

578
00:48:53,660 --> 00:48:57,430
Of course not. It doesn't end there.

579
00:49:09,090 --> 00:49:11,110
All of you must be very busy.

580
00:49:11,110 --> 00:49:14,750
Thank you for accepting my dinner invitation.

581
00:49:15,590 --> 00:49:22,110
It's an honor for us to be invited by you.

582
00:49:22,110 --> 00:49:25,210
There are many things that the National Assembly has to do,

583
00:49:25,210 --> 00:49:29,000
the war between the two parties are lasting a long time.

584
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,350
It's nothing new for us assemblymen.

585
00:49:31,350 --> 00:49:34,890
Politics is the fruit of the struggle.

586
00:49:34,890 --> 00:49:41,470
At least, in our committee, the two parties come to an agreement pretty well.

587
00:49:44,090 --> 00:49:46,290
Of course you should!

588
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:50,040
You're enemies in front of cameras,

589
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:52,590
but you have a senior and junior relationship away from it, after all.

590
00:49:52,590 --> 00:49:54,260
True.

591
00:49:54,260 --> 00:49:59,040
It's like that everywhere. Of course.

592
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:05,280
I heard that you went to the seminar in the States altogether, too?

593
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:07,280
Oh, yes. Thanks to you...

594
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:11,030
I heard that the evening was fabulous after the seminar ended.

595
00:50:11,030 --> 00:50:13,820
Well, not that much... but...

596
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:43,550
It's very... embarrassing.

597
00:50:43,550 --> 00:50:45,930
Director Han, it is not right to do this.

598
00:50:45,930 --> 00:50:49,690
Our MC Group doesn't want an uncomfortable relationship with all of you.

599
00:50:49,690 --> 00:50:51,900
Please don't misunderstand.

600
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:53,910
Team Leader Kwon?

601
00:51:21,930 --> 00:51:26,220
I don't know your wives' tastes, so we've prepared the most luxurious cars.

602
00:51:26,220 --> 00:51:31,450
Our Director Han has

603
00:51:31,450 --> 00:51:34,390
the best taste in Korea.

604
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:39,870
You probably won't be nominated this time since you've made some misjudgments.

605
00:51:39,870 --> 00:51:42,610
But you're still healthy, so you should keep working.

606
00:51:42,610 --> 00:51:45,590
Instead of the National Assembly, why don't you become a director at a private enterprise?

607
00:51:45,590 --> 00:51:50,890
The pay will be higher than the National Assembly, and you'll get a private chauffeur.

608
00:51:52,930 --> 00:51:58,110
The area you're overseeing is where out factory sits, actually.

609
00:51:58,110 --> 00:52:01,390
The library proposition that you promised remains incomplete.

610
00:52:01,390 --> 00:52:04,350
We'll build you the library.

611
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:07,510
Yes.

612
00:52:07,510 --> 00:52:11,030
If you do so, then...

613
00:52:11,030 --> 00:52:14,420
There will be shameful news tomorrow on state-owned companies.

614
00:52:14,420 --> 00:52:19,950
I hear your son obtained his job illegally. I'll have them take it out.

615
00:52:19,950 --> 00:52:23,580
Thank you, thank you.

616
00:52:23,580 --> 00:52:26,590
Your daughter is a regular at a club in Gangnam.

617
00:52:26,590 --> 00:52:31,800
Wouldn't it be best to keep away from drugs when she's so young?

618
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:37,170
No matter what, raising kids doesn't go the way you plan.

619
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:41,960
The food is getting cold.

620
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:45,190
Now, let's make a toast.

621
00:52:56,880 --> 00:53:00,260
 The revision of inheritance law that was the core of the economic democracy  

622
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:03,260
 was rejected by the Legislation-Judiciary Committee. 

623
00:53:03,260 --> 00:53:09,190
 The Blue House and the civic groups that spurred on the revision are rebuffed -- 

624
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:18,620
Exactly how many billions did you save?

625
00:53:18,620 --> 00:53:25,060
The President has changed, but the rule that controls this country is the same.

626
00:53:26,630 --> 00:53:34,360
As long as the National Assembly is in our hands, it'll always be that way.

627
00:53:40,700 --> 00:53:42,790
You worked hard.

628
00:54:05,230 --> 00:54:10,040
By investing 100 million won, we saved billions in inheritance tax.

629
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:14,000
- Especially, Lawyer Heo's idea was great. 
 - You're too kind.

630
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,430
Lawyer Heo, you worked hard.

631
00:54:19,020 --> 00:54:21,450
You all worked hard.

632
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:26,700
Then, should we start today's meeting?

633
00:54:54,310 --> 00:54:55,850
What is wrong?

634
00:54:55,850 --> 00:54:59,230
Do you still see me as a person?

635
00:54:59,230 --> 00:55:01,920
You told me before.

636
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:05,470
Don't become a monster when catching the monster.

637
00:55:07,090 --> 00:55:13,010
I wonder if I'll become one of TOP members by using their methods.

638
00:55:29,620 --> 00:55:31,630
You are still the same.

639
00:55:32,850 --> 00:55:35,610
Still ugly.

640
00:55:37,770 --> 00:55:39,510
Let's go.

641
00:55:57,850 --> 00:55:59,910
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

642
00:55:59,910 --> 00:56:03,480
I have a patient who needs acupuncture.

643
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:06,620
Tell me comfortably where you are not uncomfortable.

644
00:56:06,620 --> 00:56:10,400
Do you know Ahn Jae Rim?

645
00:56:17,780 --> 00:56:21,150
I can't say.  I don't know that person.

646
00:56:21,150 --> 00:56:27,600
There's a witness who claims you induced a drug addiction in Ahn Jae Rim.

647
00:56:29,790 --> 00:56:32,970
Please go out if you are not getting any treatment.

648
00:56:32,970 --> 00:56:36,510
If not, I will call the police.

649
00:56:58,080 --> 00:57:00,530
It doesn't seem easy.

650
00:57:00,530 --> 00:57:03,300
Why did she change her major to doctor of oriental medicine?

651
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:08,290
She must have lots of places to go to since she graduated from the top college and was at MC hospital.

652
00:57:08,290 --> 00:57:13,150
If she became skeptical about the doctors, don't you think she would have found something new?

653
00:57:13,150 --> 00:57:18,750
Or was she stripped of her certificate so that she can't be a doctor?

654
00:57:18,750 --> 00:57:22,290
Maybe..medical malpractice?

655
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:26,880
In 2003, there was an accident in Seongsoo-dong.

656
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:31,490
With that accident, the person whose lower half of the body is paralyzed requested  insurance money.

657
00:57:31,490 --> 00:57:35,060
The case was a bit weird that we looked into it.

658
00:57:35,060 --> 00:57:36,040
What about it?

659
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:38,690
The doctor prescribed the medication and the patient took it.

660
00:57:38,690 --> 00:57:41,260
The patient blacked out and had a fall.

661
00:57:41,260 --> 00:57:43,860
Who is the doctor in charge?

662
00:57:44,850 --> 00:57:47,030
Seol Mi Gyeong.

663
00:57:48,790 --> 00:57:51,740
The drug the patient took was Zolpidem.

664
00:57:51,740 --> 00:57:56,610
The company said they couldn't pay out the insurance since it was a drug addiction.

665
00:57:56,610 --> 00:57:57,550
Zolpidem?

666
00:57:57,550 --> 00:58:00,310
The medicine the doctor prescribed is Zolpidem?

667
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:04,040
Zolpitem is now considered as a controlled substance by the FDA.

668
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:07,160
You go jail if you take it without a doctor's prescription,

669
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:16,540
 Atolmin 50 mg, Amaryl 2 mg, Zolpiderm 10 mg ... 

670
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:21,350
Yes?

671
00:58:27,690 --> 00:58:30,550
There was a medical accident?

672
00:58:30,550 --> 00:58:35,010
And you gave up all your assets and information to the patient as a settlement payment.

673
00:58:35,010 --> 00:58:40,660
Why did you change your speciality to Chinese medicine after barely maintaining your license that way?

674
00:58:40,660 --> 00:58:44,790
With what money did you open this oriental medical clinic?

675
00:58:46,090 --> 00:58:50,360
It must be related to Ha Yeong Seon right?

676
00:58:58,130 --> 00:59:03,970
It was when the addictiveness of this medicine was not well know.

677
00:59:03,970 --> 00:59:08,300
But I already knew.

678
00:59:08,300 --> 00:59:11,220
Because of  the Sungsoo-dong incident.

679
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:16,040
But Madam ordered using an excessive injection.

680
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:19,620
She wanted your mother to become a drug addict.

681
00:59:19,620 --> 00:59:24,260
At first I refused but she was so persistent.

682
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:29,770
She threatened me saying she would reveal the Sungsoo-dong incident and strip me of my license as well.

683
00:59:29,770 --> 00:59:35,590
After the lady passed away, she worried that the prosecutors would suspect us.

684
00:59:35,590 --> 00:59:38,810
She told me to stop being a doctor.

685
00:59:38,810 --> 00:59:43,220
I've never thought about anything but being a doctor.

686
00:59:43,220 --> 00:59:47,190
In the end, I studied and became an oriental medicine doctor.

687
00:59:47,190 --> 00:59:49,210
So the Madam you're talking about is...

688
00:59:49,210 --> 00:59:52,860
It was Ha Yeong Seo, right?

689
00:59:52,860 --> 00:59:54,280
Yes.

690
00:59:54,280 --> 01:00:01,530
She was a nurse at our hospital, so she knew about Zolpidem well.

691
01:00:03,210 --> 01:00:07,740
I am very sorry.

692
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:25,790
Are you okay?

693
01:00:25,790 --> 01:00:30,360
Yeah. I have to be okay.

694
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:40,410
At last, a strong witness has appeared.

695
01:00:59,890 --> 01:01:02,110
It's pretty...

696
01:01:03,090 --> 01:01:07,230
I used to dislike dried flowers like that.

697
01:01:07,230 --> 01:01:09,250
Same with bouquets.

698
01:01:09,250 --> 01:01:13,500
Wrapping it up after cutting the stems...

699
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:19,360
I used to think it was a mean thing to do to flowers and that it was barbaric.

700
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:25,170
And I wondered if I had to see them dry up and wither like that, too.

701
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:30,480
But... I get it now.

702
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:33,960
Very slowly...

703
01:01:35,590 --> 01:01:38,030
little by little...

704
01:01:39,140 --> 01:01:41,240
bit by bit...

705
01:01:42,130 --> 01:01:46,070
I want to watch  her drying up and dying away.

706
01:01:46,070 --> 01:01:48,080
Mo Seok Hui.

707
01:01:50,250 --> 01:01:52,630
Ha Yeong Seo.

708
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:12,170
A slight smile, smile.

709
01:02:12,170 --> 01:02:15,050
You're doing useless things.

710
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:21,150
Won't you go away?

711
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:25,890
You look like Audrey Hepburn.

712
01:02:43,990 --> 01:02:47,980
Will you finally be finding freedom for yourself?

713
01:02:48,900 --> 01:02:52,930
I told Director Han that I wasn't getting a divorce.

714
01:02:52,930 --> 01:02:54,070
Did you not hear it?

715
01:02:54,070 --> 01:02:56,380
You wanted to get...divorced.

716
01:02:56,380 --> 01:02:57,900
I changed my mind.

717
01:02:57,900 --> 01:02:59,570
What are you up to?

718
01:02:59,570 --> 01:03:02,220
I guess you're up to something?

719
01:03:02,220 --> 01:03:07,050
Well, if you are, then I could, too.

720
01:03:08,040 --> 01:03:12,260
Married couples become similar to each other when living together.

721
01:03:12,260 --> 01:03:15,160
Although we didn't share the same blanket.

722
01:03:16,060 --> 01:03:18,120
Let's go, Honey.

723
01:03:39,270 --> 01:03:41,860
CEO is coming in.

724
01:03:50,090 --> 01:03:52,100
Sit down.

725
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:04,310
What about Seok Hui...

726
01:04:04,310 --> 01:04:07,580
We are here for Wan Joon, so no need.

727
01:04:08,540 --> 01:04:11,160
Please start.

728
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:15,210
More than a yearly income from the business units,

729
01:04:15,210 --> 01:04:18,540
all of you have saved by putting a stop to the inheritance.

730
01:04:18,540 --> 01:04:20,420
Good job.

731
01:04:20,420 --> 01:04:24,820
Moving forward please take good care of Director Mo.

732
01:04:28,260 --> 01:04:30,490
Then let's have a toast.

733
01:04:30,490 --> 01:04:33,720
To TOP's hard work and Director Mo's future,

734
01:04:33,720 --> 01:04:35,900
Cheers! Cheer.

735
01:04:35,900 --> 01:04:39,690
It's too early for the champagne, don't you think?

736
01:04:46,550 --> 01:04:49,450
Meet the new MC family member who's here from today on,

737
01:04:49,450 --> 01:04:52,890
the third mom.

738
01:05:01,150 --> 01:05:03,590
Good evening.

739
01:05:09,260 --> 01:05:15,000
♫   I'm on fire I'm on fire   ♫

740
01:05:19,350 --> 01:05:25,000
♫  You are liar, you are liar  ♫

741
01:05:27,020 --> 01:05:34,030


742
01:05:39,100 --> 01:05:47,500
♫  My Destiny. Everything is a  dream  ♫

743
01:05:47,600 --> 01:05:55,800
♫   Now I must give up everything  ♫

744
01:05:55,800 --> 01:06:02,100
♫    I think everyone is lying   ♫

745
01:06:03,240 --> 01:06:04,830
  Graceful Family  

746
01:06:04,830 --> 01:06:07,340
 So you want to become the Madam of MC Group? 

747
01:06:07,340 --> 01:06:09,570
 No reason I couldn't. 

748
01:06:09,570 --> 01:06:12,320
 Please behave yourself at home. 

749
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:16,270
 You're putty in Director Han's hands, too. Don't you have any pride? 

750
01:06:16,270 --> 01:06:19,850
 From now on, you won't be able to do what you wish alone.  

751
01:06:19,850 --> 01:06:21,790
 So now you want the company, too? 

752
01:06:21,790 --> 01:06:23,720
 Doesn't Hyung have too much shares? 

753
01:06:23,720 --> 01:06:24,890
 Background check on Director Han?  

754
01:06:24,890 --> 01:06:27,910
 It's an urgent matter to get our hands on the investigation documents from that time. 

755
01:06:27,910 --> 01:06:29,480
 Are you threatening to kill me or something?  

756
01:06:29,480 --> 01:06:33,260
 Do you remember what you did to my mom?
