 - Enjoy it. 
 - Yes. 

8
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,270
 Sorry I can't eat with you , Tae Ho. 

9
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:51,260
 Don't skip meals and at least eat some bread. 

10
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:52,960
 Okay? 

11
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,370
 Okay... 

12
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,850
 When he needed the helping hand of his mother most, 

13
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:04,500
 after being deprived of his mother by the Madame's household, 

14
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:07,390
 he soon learned loneliness first.  

15
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:52,960
  At the instant their lives started taking a turn for the worst, 

16
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,580
  the boy and girl did not know it. 

17
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:04,370
 I'm home, Madame. 

18
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:18,930
 Madame! Madame! 

19
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:33,160
 I'm home.

00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:09,730

00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:29,040
  Could the receipt he kept without much thought while missing his mother, 

23
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,050
 really change their fate  

24
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:39,240

 Episode 12 

27
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,560
We thought TOP hid you away in a foreign country

28
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,770
and didn't dare to even look for you. How...

29
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:07,730
It's a prison without bars.

30
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:23,200
 Excuse me! Excuse me! Really, some people. 

31
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:27,660
  I told you you can't pass fliers around here without permission! 

32
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:31,480
 How many times do I have to tell you? Hurry up and leave. 

33
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:36,110
You've been going through a lot.

34
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:41,150
Miss is doing well, right?

35
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:43,540
Yes, she is.

36
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:46,410
I wanted to meet with her,

37
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:49,270
but since TOP keeps such a close watch, I came to see you instead.

38
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:52,590
You did well. But how did you know about this place?

39
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:58,170
Your office was registered to be this place on the Law Association records.

40
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:01,370
Oh, it's a good thing I didn't update it.

41
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:06,060
Well... Miss...

42
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:11,110
hasn't yet given up... looking for the true culprit of the murder, right?

43
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:16,730
Of course not. She's working hard at it with me away from the eyes of TOP.

44
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:23,190
You're TOP's lawyer but you're still helping her.

45
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:30,690
Actually,  it's also something which is my business.

46
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:38,130
The person locked up in prison is my mother.

47
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:40,420
Oh my god ...

48
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:43,780
Then... I came to the right person!

49
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:44,640
Pardon?

50
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:48,690
I'm the one who introduced your mother to Madame Ahn Jae Rim.

51
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:52,500
So when they said she was the culprit, I didn't believe it.

52
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:58,420
She's not the type to do such a thing. Wow, you were her son...

53
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:08,770
This is what the judge at the time left.

This ... how did you...

57
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:24,610
Lawyer Yoon met with Judge Lee in the US.

58
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:30,030
 Embezzlement and breach of fiduciary duty?  What are you doing now? 

59
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:32,410
 That's not what I spent the money on. 

60
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:46,530
That money was used to located Judge Lee without TOP's knowledge.

61
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,690
I see.

62
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:51,750
Lawyer Yoon, who recently discovered Judge Lee's location,

63
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:56,010
on the pretext of travelling with his daughter went to the US and met Judge Lee.

64
00:06:56,010 --> 00:07:01,490
Fortunately, I remembered Lawyer Yoon's daughter's phone number, so I haven't lost contact with them.

65
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:04,710
It wouldn't have been easy to avoid Top's surveillance, how —

66
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:10,200
I used my neighbor's phone and received mail at their address.

67
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:16,570
Judge Lee is returning soon to Korea.  You should meet him.

68
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:18,980
Please investigate.

69
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:26,600
It's for your mother, so I'm sure you'll do a good job.

70
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:31,390
I certainly will find out.

71
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:39,700
Also, please convey to Miss that, for a little longer,  she should hang in there for a little longer.

72
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:46,800
The day is coming when she and I will be able to see each other freely.

73
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:52,300
Yes. I will certainly  make that happen.

 Tae Ho,  Madame is urgently looking for me. I"m sorry I can't eat dinner with you. 

77
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,890
 Sorry for not having dinner with you. 

78
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:47,910

 At 4:20 pm

81
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:58,390
Mom and I separated, and I went home.

82
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,930
Then Mom also ... became a suspect then

83
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:27,270
 Lawyer Heo 

84
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:30,660
-Hmm? 
  - I found it.

85
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:33,240
- What? 
 - The investigation material.

86
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,580
What?  How?

Gwang Mi, we have to build up our strength now. Let's eat as much as we can.  Here.

89
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:48,810
Right.  If you want to go to Ameria to find that judge, you can't be sick all the time.

90
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:53,080
Chief, can you really find him?

91
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:56,590
As Seok Hui said, that his wife is ill is a crucial clue.

92
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:59,310
She has a rare disease and even if the surgery was successful, she needs continuing medical care.

93
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:05,340
True.  Baltimore International Airport and Johns Hopkins Hospital... then there is enough basis.

94
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:07,500
Wouldn't TOP have at least done that as part of the deal?

95
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:14,330
Right.  Anyway, we have an obligation and a responsibility

96
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:17,060
as large as this giant squid to find the judge.

97
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:21,000
Are you advertising squid.  Do you work while eating?  Stop it.  You're making me sick.

98
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,700
- Then when do you work? Should we not talk while eating? 
 - There you go again. Talking back to your Sunbae.

99
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,860
Again again again you are an uber-visor.

100
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:31,190
- "Uber-viser?" How old are you? 
 - 31

101
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:34,160
Do you want to lose the molar you've had for 31 years?

102
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:38,300
- It's an implant. 
 - You need a new one.

103
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:47,500
Yes. Lawyer Heo. What?  Okay.

104
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:52,700
- What did he say? 
 - Gwang Mi,  we will go to America in our next life.

105
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,440
Why?

106
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:00,770
The time the murder occurred is 4 p.m. after Mom and I separated

107
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:04,400
She went back to the villa after the incident happened.

108
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:08,100
She became one of the suspects. Just from looking at the investigation materials.

109
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:13,900
However, I am certain Mom is not the murderer. Well, I just don't have the proof yet.

110
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:19,110
But,  it's on the record in the investigation file  that there's no CCTV video because of the CCTV failure.

111
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:20,880
This is missing evidence.

112
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,250
The CCTV footage we have is proof positive

113
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:26,270
that the case was inadequately investigated.

114
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:28,520
In addition, Judge Lee Dong Joon will soon appear

115
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:31,510
to make a declaration of conscience that he was lobbied by Director Han.

116
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:33,830
If you have at least that, there will be no problem requesting judicial reconsideration of the case.

117
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:38,190
Naturally.  But if the request is denied, you can't make another request for the same reason.

118
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:39,700
So it has to be done carefully.

119
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:45,400
In order to increase the chance of success we need to prove Han, MC Group and Joo Hyeong Gil colluded.

120
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,530
If we have no evidence about these three,

121
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:49,920
the worst-case scenario is they will get away,

122
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,460
and only Judge Lee Dong Joon who declared his conscience will be punished.

123
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:54,350
- So? 
 - We need to obtain evidence that Director Han

124
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:58,190
and Joo Hyeong Il have a special relationship.

125
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:02,120
Then Director Han and Prosecutor Joo Hyeong Il, do we have to just go wait for them blindly?

126
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:05,340
Although it's hard, I'm asking you to do it.

127
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:08,000
She's the human cultural asset of waiting blindly.

128
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,350
Also, please prepare articles pertaining to Prosecutor Joo Hyeong Il

129
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:15,600
as far as suspicious growth in his assets, bribes,

130
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,290
or suspicions of poor investigation.

131
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:20,030
I write articles really fast.

132
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:22,980
Once I even wrote 90 articles in a day. 50.

133
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:25,340
10, I really wrote 10.

134
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:41,760
Better safe than sorry. There's nothing wrong with being prepared.

135
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,360
Gwang Mi, you do the bus terminal.

136
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,190
Lawyer Heo, you do the subway.

137
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:48,230
Seok Hui, go with him and don't fight.

138
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:53,260
As for me, I have my own safe spot. Let's go.

It's hard to eat my meal like this.

157
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:32,350
Honey.

158
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:37,800
Wan Joon is not your son nor mine

159
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,230
but MC Group's son.

160
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:45,860
If you're scared of it getting out, it's our household issue

161
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:48,660
and we should cover it up.

162
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:53,480
It's something that you and Director Han can easily cover up with your capabilities.

163
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:58,100
You're supposed to be a mother.

164
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,950
It's because you're like this that he's in that shape!

165
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:02,520
So, who are you going to give the company to?

166
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:06,370
You can't do it. Rather, kill me first.

167
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:10,470
Even if I have to use every lawyer in the world,

168
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:14,820
I will protect our Wan Joon.

169
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:17,310
I won't ever back down.

170
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:45,440
Stop working immediately on Wan Joon's successorship.

171
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,940
CEO.

172
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,900
If they find out that the CEO of a corporation is going around dressing like a woman, would he have any authority?

173
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:53,650
The world has changed.

174
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:57,240
There are many transgender and gay public figures.

175
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:00,530
He got caught doing around doing those things.

176
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:03,760
Once a secret leaks out, like spilled water,

177
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,870
you can't put it back.

178
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:10,100
You're the one who's always said you can't have your children turn out the way you wish.

179
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:12,640
- You need to change your mind. 
 - Director Han!

180
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,270
You are the head of MC Group.

181
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:18,170
You can't be moved by your own personal feelings.

182
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:21,160
Making a weak point a strong point is what TOP does.

183
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:24,670
Just trust and leave it to us like you always have.

184
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:52,000
Thank you. I mean it.

185
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:07,180
Give me solutions for breaking through problems regarding Vice-President Mo Wan Joon.

186
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:15,680
What about you, Lawyer Heo?

187
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:20,720
Why don't we just enter the Pink Money market?

188
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,690
It's supposed to be a sizable market and valued over 1 trillion throughout the world.

189
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:25,590
So?

190
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:29,160
As long as we can profit, there's no reason for

191
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:32,790
board members or shareholders to oppose Vice-President Mo Wan Joon's identity.

192
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:36,890
What if the photos leak

193
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:39,290
and the press cling on his sexual preference tenaciously?

194
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:41,150
What about using this opportunity to do a

195
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:43,980
campaign opposing the discrimination of sexual minorities

196
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:47,270
as a group?

197
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:49,570
Gender issues are a sensitive topic in society

198
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:52,310
but something someone has to take the lead and tackle.

199
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:54,180
In preparation for a possible leak,

200
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:58,350
giving him a reason to dress up as a woman is a solution, too.

201
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:02,440
Take on that task.

202
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,750
Yes.

203
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:09,620
 On today's Hot Issue, we have someone who took an audition to be an extra for his older brother's audition, 

204
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:11,940
 MC Group's Vice President Mo Wan Joon. 

205
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,250
 - Welcome. 
 - Hello. 

206
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:16,030
 You're busy running a business, 

207
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:19,350
 so how did you think to appear as an extra in a movie? 

208
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:24,750
 Our group is planning to enter the pink money market, 

209
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:28,640
 and by chance, the movie my brother was making had to do with sexual minorities. 

210
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,490
 So as a group, given this opportunity, 

211
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:34,830
 we started a campaign to take interest in sexual minorities in our society. 

212
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:38,250
 So I, in order to be of some help in the campaign, 

213
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:41,130
 decided to participate in the audition. 

214
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:44,350
The stock market's reaction to our new enterprise isn't bad.

215
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:48,650
The response to the campaign on discrimination against minorities is good.

216
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:53,600
Especially in the younger age group, they are starting to have a positive image of our group.

217
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:57,100
You worked hard.

218
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:59,490
By chance, the movie was in the works already.

219
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:02,180
Though we're sorry to Master Mo Wan Soo...

220
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:07,280
An airplane crashed.

221
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:12,610
But while the reporters are running around only concerned about those who died,

222
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:15,870
what would have a reporter like Lawyer Heo focused on?

223
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:21,420
He would have looked for those who wanted to be on that plane but missed it.

224
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:27,560
Our meeting today is done.

225
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:32,990
Director, I have something to report.

226
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:35,210
Come upstairs.

227
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,490
The day after you asked me to look into their whereabouts,

228
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:48,340
I found out Master Wan Soo visited Vice President's apartment.

229
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:53,330
Really? That's interesting.

230
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:57,330
I thought exposing Vice President Mo Wan Joon was Miss Mo Seok Hui's revenge plan,

231
00:20:57,330 --> 00:20:59,900
but you're saying it was Master Wan Soo's work?

232
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:06,870
No. If Miss had given Master Wan Soo the info on the apartment...

233
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,370
 What is it? 

234
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:14,320
 Present. 

235
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:18,030
 (Address of Wan Joon's apartment) 

236
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:21,000
Their joint effort?

237
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:31,020
 Catch the blue ocean of pink money! MC Group Vice President Mo's ambition   

238
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:30,670
 So that's why we planned a group campaign 

239
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:32,870
 to have interest in society's minorities. 

240
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:36,300
 So in order to be of some help in the campaign, 

241
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:38,580
 I decided to participate. 

242
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:42,220
 I even auditioned dressed up as a woman,  

243
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:44,350
 but my brother rejected me in the end. 

244
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:47,010
 I took a look in the waiting room, 

245
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:51,530
 and you looked pretty good as a woman used for the campaign. 

246
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:55,090
 No matter how good it looks, I don't want to dress up like that anymore.   

247
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:12,710
Director Han

248
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:17,270
is a charming friend.

249
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:24,150
So that's why it's harder to give up...

250
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:43,020
Judge, sir, please give me your phone first.

251
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:46,950
You know Director Han can be outrageous.  Please be patient a little longer.

252
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,090
Lawyer in the morning, cleaner at night. You live diligently.

253
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:08,720
You're the one who has a crazy schedule, no?

254
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,710
What brings you by here? You need a nighttime snack?

255
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:16,550
I have a guest.

256
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,220
Please.

257
00:24:45,770 --> 00:24:49,480
You were in hiding for 15 years.

258
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:52,540
Why are you showing up now?

259
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:58,140
When I was young, my wife even worked at a bath house

260
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:00,940
and supported my law studies.

261
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:07,800
But after I became a judge and felt comfortable, a huge tragedy happened.

262
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:12,520
If I just close my eyes once, I could save my wife.

263
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:16,560
In return for saving your wife's life,

264
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:21,300
my mom and I... died.

265
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:27,430
I've lived my life always sorry for what I did.

266
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:33,890
I... and my mother... can't forgive you.

267
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:37,610
And you're sorry? What right do you have?

268
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:43,960
After sending away your mother like that,

269
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:48,110
I looked for you, but I couldn't find you.

270
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:53,760
And not long after, my wife and I went to the US and we lived there.

271
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:57,760
Recently, my wife died.

272
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:03,400
I thought the time had come to answer for my sin.

273
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:09,770
I want to pay for my sin, even now.

274
00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:14,110
If it's not too late.

275
00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:19,030
Someone who wanted to pay for his sin,

276
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:22,310
why haven't you said anything this whole time?

277
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:27,100
Human beings can have guilt,

278
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:31,680
but not everyone can muster up the courage.

279
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:36,650
Probably in my heart, there must have been a feeling, too,

280
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:40,320
where I wished for this to just pass.

281
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:44,990
I'm really sorry.

282
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:55,730
Paying for your sins... when my mom comes out of prison, then do it then in person.

283
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:07,180
Mustering up the courage, even now, while putting yourself in danger,

284
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:14,680
thank you for that.

285
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,890
Thank you.

286
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:26,800
Now I can die in peace...

287
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:45,160
 Mo Wan Joon was the first one to go visit mom.  

288
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:48,610
 Did he kill her? 

289
00:27:48,610 --> 00:27:54,520
 He murdered and called his mother. 

290
00:27:54,520 --> 00:28:00,240
 And what if that's why she came running? After her came Mo Wan Soo...  

291
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:05,560
 But why did Oppa Wan Soo go there? 

292
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:11,990
The Chairman has arrived.

293
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:21,560
I thought I told you not to appear in front of me.

294
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,780
Father.

295
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:26,210
Get out of my sight.

296
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,800
I'll move aside.

297
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:41,300
But I don't plan on leaving this house.

298
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:53,550
Our Wan Joon will never leave the house.

299
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:57,940
There's not reason for him to leave this house.

300
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:05,940
 The one who appeared after Wan Soo was 

301
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:10,270
 Father... Why did he go there?  

302
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:17,640
Do you have something to say?

303
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:23,000
I don't think I've ever had a proper conversation with you, Father.

304
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:31,160
Come to my study, Wan Soo, after you're done eating.

305
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,540
Pardon?

306
00:29:34,670 --> 00:29:37,130
Yes, Father.

307
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:53,360
 Father and Oppa Wan Soo, did they also have a reason to kill Mom? 

308
00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:07,340
Don't you have anything to confess?

309
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:10,810
I'm asking if you have anything to shock me with with like Wan Joon.

310
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:16,050
Father, you already know.

311
00:30:16,050 --> 00:30:19,890
I live a simple life unlike how I might seem.

312
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:24,590
Well, I have a lot of curiosity, so I've had a lot of varied experiences.

313
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:30,210
And these days I haven't caused any big problems.

314
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:39,800
But is there something you have to say to me?

315
00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:46,780
Will you continue making movies?

316
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:47,860
Yes.

317
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:51,190
Do you know about the Medici Family of Italy?

318
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:55,280
Of course, I know.

319
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:58,170
They found success in finance,

320
00:30:58,170 --> 00:31:01,550
but they invested in culture and have gone down in history all over the world

321
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:04,590
as ones having given birth to Renaissance culture.

322
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:08,670
Our MC, too,

323
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:14,730
if we don't invest in culture in the future, it'll be hard for us to stay successful.

324
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:21,250
Can you do well?

325
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:25,990
Yes. Father.

326
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,230
Oh, Director Han!

327
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:49,330
I think Father is going to say something very important.

328
00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:51,200
You should go on in.

329
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:18,450
Yes.

330
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:22,750
Yo my sister, Mo Seok Hui!

331
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:28,090
Your decision to bet on me,

332
00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:30,820
Amazing!

333
00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:35,910
I think lady luck favors you too much.

334
00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:38,290
An opportunity has finally come your way?

335
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:39,990
Yeah.

336
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:48,920
My only sister... Is Wan Joon one, too, now?

337
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:51,860
Anyway, who else but me would take care of you?

338
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:53,750
We'll become very busy soon.

339
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:57,120
Let's stay on our toes, Seok Hui.

340
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:07,960
Oppa. Do you think my mom is a really cool artist?

341
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:10,700
Of course.

342
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:14,710
But... you talk about her a lot these days.

343
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:20,420
Well, since you're an artist, too. I thought you could have been close to her.

344
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:24,620
Naturally, as an artist, I respect her,

345
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:29,160
but to be honest, our relationship wasn't one that made it easy for us to become close, no?

346
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:33,550
You probably never met Mom in private before, right?

347
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:35,130
In private?

348
00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:39,730
In private..

349
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:47,020
I don't remember since it was a long time ago.

350
00:33:50,170 --> 00:33:55,320
But then again, my memories fade, too.

351
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:58,270
When I want to remember Mom forever.

352
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:13,130
Wan Joon, that punk, remove him.

353
00:34:13,130 --> 00:34:14,310
Chairman.

354
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:18,220
From now on become Wan Soo's right hand man.

355
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:20,140
Not Young Master Wan Soo.

356
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:22,970
Why? What can't you do?

357
00:34:22,970 --> 00:34:25,460
It's not that I can't, it's that I won't.

358
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:29,940
The leader of MC is a decision-maker who is responsible for many employees.

359
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:32,090
It has to be someone we can predict.

360
00:34:32,090 --> 00:34:36,390
Impulsive and free-spirited Mo Wan So is dangerous.

361
00:34:36,390 --> 00:34:38,620
Isn't controlling Mo Wan Soo to simple for someone

362
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:42,000
with the ability to change a woman into a man?

363
00:34:43,350 --> 00:34:46,510
Isn't Mo Seok Hui better?

364
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:49,240
-No, not Seok Hui. 
-Why?

365
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:53,620
Is it because your child competed with you in front of the Big Chairman?

366
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:59,230
Right, that's my limit.

367
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:05,350
It's a fish which can't be caught in the end no matter how tight your grip.

368
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:09,340
You should not follow in the footsteps of Head Chairman who made the wrong choice because of his emotions.

369
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:13,670
you can't take the same step.

370
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:20,570
Your tongue has gotten longer. 
   (She has got a lot to say) .

371
00:35:21,810 --> 00:35:26,840
Wan Soo, that one, make him a proper person.

372
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,890
I have something I'm curious about.

373
00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:20,800
Do you not have any regrets throwing Mom away to get Director Han?

374
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,370
What are you saying all of a sudden?

375
00:36:22,370 --> 00:36:28,360
According to my memory, before my mom died, she planned to come into the house.

376
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:33,830
Did you not have any plans for accepting us?

377
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:39,730
I want to know how you felt at that time.

378
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:42,020
Where your mind was at.

379
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:47,410
I...... don't look back.

380
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:54,860
Did you hate Mom to the point you wanted to kill her?

381
00:36:56,750 --> 00:37:01,390
Did you even love her?

382
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:06,830
That is a riddle with multiple answers.

383
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:24,110
CEO thinks we need to prepare the Wan Soo card in case something goes wrong.

384
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:26,540
I don't think the Chairman's decision is bad.

385
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:29,080
There is an aspect of the Chairman which  for a while  has been going overboard

386
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,470
to exclude Young Master Mo Wan Joon.

387
00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:35,180
His personality is good and also has a lot of good sides to him.

388
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:39,380
Isn't it that you are thinking favorably because you're more comfortable with him?

389
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:41,950
You don't agree with me.

390
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:46,770
I agree we should get prepared for the worst case scenario.

391
00:37:46,770 --> 00:37:51,680
But in the same sense, I disagree when thinking of the worst case scenario.

392
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:54,830
Managers who are uncertain about their next move are at great risk!

393
00:37:54,830 --> 00:37:58,090
We  must take responsibility for handling MC Group exclusively.

394
00:37:58,090 --> 00:38:02,010
Therefore, your conclusion is  unacceptable.

395
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:09,370
As expected, the air at TOP always feels lively.

396
00:38:11,170 --> 00:38:16,130
If I drank this air, I think I will live to 100.

397
00:38:18,290 --> 00:38:20,140
Present.

398
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:35,360
Some people think you only look good in a uniform.

399
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:42,990
Not at all. Our Director Han harmonizes well with flowers.

400
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:47,840
Look.  Two shot right now... is magnificent.

401
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:53,510
Do you like it? Gladiolus?

402
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:59,020
The name of the flower comes from the Latin word gladius which is "sword".

403
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:04,910
Do you know why I like you? Because you're perfect.

404
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:06,960
Look, there's nothing you don't know.

405
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:10,860
That's why we are having this conversation right now.

406
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:12,820
It's an honor.

407
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:18,720
Have you ever received any presents like this from grandfather and father?

408
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:22,690
Well,  I don't think so.

409
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:27,860
See? That's what it is. This is exactly my way of doing things.

410
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:32,250
Something not every one thinks about, so something not everyone can do...

411
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:36,530
That is what this Mo Wan Soo does.

412
00:39:36,530 --> 00:39:39,440
Don't you agree?

413
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,410
I do agree.

414
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:47,860
But did you know that your uniqueness is inappropriate to be the CEO of MC Group?

415
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:53,770
If it was possible, I would've already chosen you.

416
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:12,850
But what could be the reason? Why is it impossible?

417
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:17,030
You know better.

418
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:29,580
No. I don't know a thing.

419
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:37,170
Do you perhaps know what this flower means?

420
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:41,980
Warning, caution.

421
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:45,570
Since we should not be reckless when it comes to using a sword.

422
00:40:45,570 --> 00:40:46,930
Bingo!

423
00:40:46,930 --> 00:40:51,790
Look, we could be awesome if we worked together.

424
00:41:09,770 --> 00:41:11,090
You're here?

425
00:41:11,090 --> 00:41:14,010
Has there been contact yet between Director Han and the Chief Prosecutor?

426
00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:16,760
Not yet.

427
00:41:18,650 --> 00:41:22,760
Right now, we have all the qualifications for a retrial.

428
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:25,440
So, you want to reveal everything now?

429
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:31,410
Bullets are more powerful when they are loaded.

430
00:41:31,410 --> 00:41:34,540
Do you think we'll be approved for a retrial?

431
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:39,530
For Director Han, a retrial would be laughable.

432
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:44,160
Contrary to the Chairman's desires, Director Han will eventually seat Mo Wan Joon as the leader.

433
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:49,540
Her determination to protect Mo Wan Joon and MC Group will grow stronger and stronger.

434
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:52,170
Her influence now over the judiciary and the prosecution has  crazily grown much greater

435
00:41:52,170 --> 00:41:56,180
than it was 15 years ago when she covered up the murder.

436
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:57,750
So?

437
00:41:57,750 --> 00:42:03,650
If we leave it like this now, we won't ever be able to reveal her crimes.

438
00:42:07,270 --> 00:42:11,050
Let's catch her first.

439
00:42:13,870 --> 00:42:15,870
You know the thing you're good at.

440
00:42:15,870 --> 00:42:20,190
Divide and Rule! Separate and Conquer!

441
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,790
It's been a while.

442
00:42:42,550 --> 00:42:44,750
Yes, it has.

443
00:42:45,690 --> 00:42:49,560
The girl that was this tall has become a great adult.

444
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:54,950
You were a staff prosecutor then.  Now you are the  chief prosecutor.

445
00:42:54,950 --> 00:42:57,990
It has been a long time since then.

446
00:42:57,990 --> 00:43:00,910
Rumor has it that you are going to be the Prosecutor General soon.

447
00:43:00,910 --> 00:43:05,380
That... well, it's just a change of personnel.

448
00:43:13,010 --> 00:43:19,260
I'm sure our precious Seok Hui didn't ask to see me just to eat.

449
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:23,830
Our Tae Hyeong ... is there still a possibility?

450
00:43:23,830 --> 00:43:29,630
Unless I'm crazy, why would I marry Prosecutor Joo?

451
00:43:30,670 --> 00:43:37,300
And, if heaven is not crazy, why would it allow you to be the Prosecutor General?

452
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:50,600
Didn't you receive a request from Director Han  to cover up a murder 15 years ago?

453
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:56,290
I'm sure you think it's all set for you to become the Prosecutor General,

454
00:43:56,290 --> 00:43:59,380
but don't you think your past actions will become your shackles?

455
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:05,380
You.. what are you trying to say?

456
00:44:07,860 --> 00:44:12,430
What I want is simple. MC Group.

457
00:44:14,670 --> 00:44:18,410
It may not seem like it but I have a lot of greed when it comes to money.

458
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:23,090
But now that I'm trying to obtain MC Group,

459
00:44:23,090 --> 00:44:27,230
the worst obstacle is Han Je Gook, the executive director.

460
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:33,610
If you leave it alone right now, wouldn't you be uncomfortable later on?

461
00:44:33,610 --> 00:44:35,390
So?

462
00:44:36,910 --> 00:44:42,360
You should be free of a murder case from now on...

463
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:45,700
Use this opportunity to break free from Director Han.

464
00:44:47,660 --> 00:44:49,080
That's very daring.

465
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:54,500
Put Director Han ... into prison.

466
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:02,400
You know the thing that prosecutors do best.

467
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:06,350
Shake it all out again and again, and if nothing comes out, do it some more until something does.

468
00:45:06,350 --> 00:45:11,990
On top of that, if you wanted to, there are plenty of things you could get Director Han for.

469
00:45:13,490 --> 00:45:15,620
Mo Seok Hui.

470
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:20,190
I'll excuse myself since I'm busy.

471
00:45:20,190 --> 00:45:24,330
I'll pretend I didn't hear this conversation today.

472
00:45:44,810 --> 00:45:50,230
Chief Prosecutor, it wasn't enough after the murder case for you to be on a roll at the prosecutors office,

473
00:45:50,230 --> 00:45:53,360
your assets also increased a lot.

474
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:03,800
What's the source?

475
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:06,420
Is that important?

476
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:12,420
What is important is that these articles are waiting in a row.

477
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:17,610
Right after the murder case, you moved to Cheongdam-dong and your assets have increased a lot since then.

478
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:26,960
Well, where did this high-end information come from?

479
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:33,590
Don't believe Director Han too much.

480
00:46:33,590 --> 00:46:38,310
The moment you get in MC Group's way, no one is an exception.

481
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:45,170
You have two options.

482
00:46:45,170 --> 00:46:51,160
First, send her to jail and become the prosecutor general.

483
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:56,940
Second, save her and you get branded a corrupt prosecutor

484
00:46:56,940 --> 00:47:02,060
and both of you go to jail.

485
00:47:06,650 --> 00:47:08,760
I'm sorry there aren't many alternatives.

486
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:13,160
Chairman Mo Cheol Hui raised his daughter as a worthy and great man.

487
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:18,930
Side with me and stay with MC forever.

488
00:47:41,410 --> 00:47:45,020
How's this for tomorrow's news headline?

489
00:47:45,020 --> 00:47:50,520
A prosecutor general candidate, 15 years ago received money from MC Group,

490
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:54,490
and sent an innocent person to jail.

491
00:48:00,710 --> 00:48:04,030
I'm impatient, so I can't wait long.

492
00:48:21,570 --> 00:48:24,980
I heard Wan Soo visits the company frequently.

493
00:48:24,980 --> 00:48:26,790
It's nothing to be concerned about.

494
00:48:26,790 --> 00:48:32,530
I have never thought of him as a competition.

495
00:48:32,530 --> 00:48:34,470
Seok Hui might be different.

496
00:48:34,470 --> 00:48:37,370
What do you want to hear?

497
00:48:38,130 --> 00:48:40,180
Who knows.

498
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:44,230
Your thoughts on Mo Seok Hui?

499
00:48:44,230 --> 00:48:49,060
I've never considered her, but she isn't lacking.

500
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:58,730
MC's leader needs to be the shark. Among sea animals, it's the only one without an air bladder.

501
00:48:58,730 --> 00:49:04,280
So they have to swim for all of their lives in order to not sink under water.

502
00:49:05,470 --> 00:49:07,280
It's a tiring fate.

503
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:09,950
You knew and chose it.

504
00:49:09,950 --> 00:49:12,090
Of course.

505
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:15,880
One second.

506
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:17,660
 Chief Prosecutor Joo 

507
00:49:17,660 --> 00:49:19,850
Yes, it's me.

508
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:22,940
Excuse me?

509
00:49:27,070 --> 00:49:32,170
Mo Seok Hui came to me with the incident that happened 15 years ago, and wanted to make a deal.

510
00:49:32,170 --> 00:49:33,520
Deal?

511
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:36,680
She told me to imprison you.

512
00:49:39,890 --> 00:49:41,690
In return for imprisoning me, what will you get?

513
00:49:41,690 --> 00:49:45,380
She brought  ridiculous corruption information against me  from somewhere.

514
00:49:45,380 --> 00:49:48,750
How the heck are you managing the MC family?

515
00:49:49,510 --> 00:49:56,300
But Chief Prosecutor, surely you have the investigation materials in a secure place.

516
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:11,190
Materials I have are safe in the prosecution's storage.

517
00:50:11,190 --> 00:50:14,490
By the way, why are you bringing that up?

518
00:50:14,490 --> 00:50:17,160
The Chairman has it, too, doesn't he?

519
00:50:23,790 --> 00:50:27,540
 What are you planning to do with the criminal investigation materials? 

520
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:31,590
 Director Han said she wanted to keep them, 

521
00:50:31,590 --> 00:50:37,310
 but I can't trouble her with that. I'll keep them safe. 

522
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:49,150
 We can all be safe only if I keep them. 

523
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:54,020
 Prosecutor Joo, is your goal to become Chief Prosecutor of the Seoul Central District Prosecutor's Office? 

524
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:57,000
 Will that be enough?  

525
00:50:58,090 --> 00:51:03,100
 I will make you the Prosecutor General. 

526
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:09,340
 In exchange, let me have the investigation materials. 

527
00:51:21,250 --> 00:51:26,730
Don't worry about what I have and manage MC Group well.

528
00:51:28,930 --> 00:51:32,700
Ahead of becoming the Prosecutor General, you got a surprise rival.

529
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:37,590
If there's anything I can do for you, just let me know.

530
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:44,230
Don't carelessly act out and wait patiently.

531
00:51:44,230 --> 00:51:47,960
Up to now, you lived only pursuing a sunny spot, haven't you?

532
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:52,350
There's a chance you'll get buried in a sunny spot while favoring sunny spots.

533
00:52:39,590 --> 00:52:44,550
Team Leader Yoon. Thoroughly investigate the club which Miss Mo Seok Hui frequented.

534
00:52:44,550 --> 00:52:48,410
Also, look into everything possible about Heo Yoon Do.

535
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:56,200
Mo Seok Hui approached Joo Hyeong Il?

536
00:53:15,930 --> 00:53:22,610
Chairman, where are the investigation materials for the housekeeper's murder case?

537
00:53:24,750 --> 00:53:26,470
What are you asking for all of a sudden?

538
00:53:26,470 --> 00:53:29,890
Miss Seok Hui met with Chief Prosecutor Joo Hyeong Il.

539
00:53:29,890 --> 00:53:32,420
What? Why?

540
00:53:32,420 --> 00:53:39,210
I think it's related to the murder case from fifteen years ago.

541
00:53:39,210 --> 00:53:42,820
Oh no. What the hell is this?

542
00:53:42,820 --> 00:53:45,600
Where is the investigation materials?

543
00:53:46,910 --> 00:53:48,200
I put them in a safe place.

544
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:51,420
I have to see them personally with my own eyes.

545
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:55,460
I will take care of them myself.

546
00:53:56,690 --> 00:53:58,380
- I got rid of them. 
 - What?

547
00:53:58,380 --> 00:54:03,620
Prosecutor Joo is basically like our family. What's the point of keeping around something that feels uncomfortable?

548
00:54:03,620 --> 00:54:06,300
I burned them all five years ago.

549
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:39,170
It's me.  Director Han's reaction is unusual.

550
00:54:39,170 --> 00:54:40,610
Let's meet right now.

551
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:42,790
Okay.

552
00:54:48,110 --> 00:54:51,270
 Detective Oh 

553
00:55:06,610 --> 00:55:11,250
Director Han, Joo Hyeong Il, this is only the beginning.

554
00:55:14,690 --> 00:55:18,900
Nothing has leaked out from the investigation materials we have.

555
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:25,390
So what was the purpose of Mo Seok Hui meeting with  the chief prosecutor?

556
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:34,550
For now it seems that the chief prosecutor rejected my offer.

557
00:55:34,550 --> 00:55:36,190
You already expected that.

558
00:55:36,190 --> 00:55:38,630
Was the scene of the two of them meeting filmed?

559
00:55:38,630 --> 00:55:40,520
Yes.

560
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:42,860
Now, Director Han figuring out my identity and

561
00:55:42,860 --> 00:55:46,990
that we're investigating the murder case is only a matter of time.

562
00:55:46,990 --> 00:55:48,430
I'm sure...

563
00:55:48,430 --> 00:55:53,670
If that is so, from this moment on ... let's think about it from her perspective.

564
00:55:54,420 --> 00:55:59,070
Given TOP's information network,  I am sure that there is a report  also of Judge Lee's return,

565
00:55:59,070 --> 00:56:01,160
Then, they will try to locate the judge first.

566
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:04,610
She will use any method in order to find the investigation materials we have.

567
00:56:04,610 --> 00:56:09,380
Because somehow making the murder case public and a retrial must be blocked.

568
00:56:09,380 --> 00:56:11,500
And what should we be doing?

569
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:16,550
In the meantime, we must figure out Director Han's Achilles heel.

570
00:56:28,930 --> 00:56:32,300
-What about Lawyer Heo? 
 - He got off work while out of the office.

571
00:56:35,010 --> 00:56:36,850
Did you guys confirm it?

572
00:56:36,850 --> 00:56:40,770
Mo Seok Hui hasn't been going to clubs to dance.

573
00:56:40,770 --> 00:56:42,850
- Did you cross check? 
 - Yes.

574
00:56:42,850 --> 00:56:46,170
Instead of using the VIP room for drinking and dancing,

575
00:56:46,170 --> 00:56:50,170
I got confirmation from the staff that she used the room for meetings.

576
00:56:51,690 --> 00:56:54,570
Recently, I got the results of the analysis of phone records for Attorney Heo and Mo Seok Hui.

577
00:56:54,570 --> 00:56:57,390
They are talking with News Patch reporters and Detective Oh In Gyoo.

578
00:56:57,390 --> 00:57:00,020
We confirmed that the detective is attorney Heo's friend.

579
00:57:00,020 --> 00:57:01,940
Okay.

580
00:57:03,250 --> 00:57:07,150
We went through several years of financial records and found something strange.

581
00:57:07,150 --> 00:57:08,010
Really?

582
00:57:08,010 --> 00:57:10,890
Until 2013, he sent money by postal checks.

583
00:57:10,890 --> 00:57:13,520
And from 2014 he transferred money to a bank account.

584
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:15,670
Who is the owner of the account?

585
00:57:15,670 --> 00:57:17,820
It's Im Soon.

586
00:57:17,820 --> 00:57:22,040
I haven't identified Im Soon yet but I will continue to investigate it.

587
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:23,960
Don't bother.

588
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:32,030
Excuse me, Director. I got called by the immigration office.

589
00:57:32,030 --> 00:57:32,870
Which one?

590
00:57:32,870 --> 00:57:37,130
Judge Lee Dong Joon has returned to Korea a few days ago.

591
00:57:41,340 --> 00:57:44,790
Find out where he is.

592
00:57:44,790 --> 00:57:48,600
Find any trace of Lawyer Heo, the News Patch reporters or Detective Oh approaching him.

593
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:50,310
I understand.

594
00:57:50,310 --> 00:57:54,070
Once Judge Lee's location is confirmed,  we must immediately restrain him.

595
00:57:54,070 --> 00:57:54,990
Yes, ma'am.

596
00:57:54,990 --> 00:57:57,460
Director, what's going on?

597
00:57:57,460 --> 00:58:00,590
Did Lawyer Heo cause trouble?

598
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:15,570
 Judge, I didn't kill them! 

599
00:58:15,570 --> 00:58:17,430
 It wasn't me! I've been wronged! 

600
00:58:17,430 --> 00:58:18,850
 Mom! Mom! 

601
00:58:18,850 --> 00:58:20,060
 - Tae Ho! 
 - Mom! 

602
00:58:20,060 --> 00:58:21,870
 - It wasn't me! 
 - Mom! 

603
00:58:21,870 --> 00:58:24,630
 - It wasn't me! 
 - Mom! 

604
00:58:28,020 --> 00:58:33,930
  Someone who knew Lawyer Heo's father well said Heo Yoon Do and his mother died in a car accident years ago. 

605
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:39,570
 Heo Yoon Do was Park Tae Ho? 

606
00:58:40,230 --> 00:58:45,890
 Park Seo Ho meets with Mo Seok Hui and goes around digging up the murder incident that happened 15 years ago? 

607
00:58:45,890 --> 00:58:50,160
 At this moment when Judge Lee Dong Joon came back to Korea? 

608
00:59:02,550 --> 00:59:05,640
What's up today, you always go out early in the morning.

609
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:08,860
I am taking a day off because I have few errands to run.

610
00:59:08,860 --> 00:59:14,480
Yoon Do, it's good that you are trying to prove your mom's innocent, but you need to take care of yourself.

611
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:17,100
Father, why worry?

612
00:59:17,100 --> 00:59:21,670
Who am I? Heo Yoon Do, excessively well adjusted, living well at any place!

613
00:59:21,670 --> 00:59:22,860
Do you not trust me?

614
00:59:22,860 --> 00:59:25,490
My feeling is different from that.

615
00:59:25,490 --> 00:59:29,200
Anyway, don't do anything dangerous.

616
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:31,310
Don't worry.

617
00:59:40,690 --> 00:59:45,410
After analyzing Judge Lee Dong Joon's phone records,  he's been confirmed to be staying at a friend's place.

618
00:59:45,410 --> 00:59:47,420
And right now, Team Leader Gwon is on scene.

619
00:59:47,420 --> 00:59:49,810
- Get him connected. 
 - Okay.

620
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:54,830
- How did it go? 
 - He left already.

621
00:59:54,830 --> 00:59:57,420
Okay, come back to work.

622
00:59:58,820 --> 01:00:03,930
Director, Judge Lee's phone is off, and having analyzed the CCTV nearby his friend's place,

623
01:00:03,930 --> 01:00:07,620
we saw him getting into Reporter Kim Boo Gi's car.

624
01:00:07,620 --> 01:00:13,130
He has disappeared into a hiding place. Find out where Reporter Kim took Judge Lee.

625
01:00:13,130 --> 01:00:14,090
Yes.

626
01:00:14,090 --> 01:00:18,230
- As soon as you find him, bring Judge Lee to me no matter what. 
 - Yes.

627
01:00:18,230 --> 01:00:20,050
- You know Kim Boo Gi personally, don't you? 
 - Yes.

628
01:00:20,050 --> 01:00:23,800
Go confront him and find out where he took Judge Lee.

629
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:25,890
Yes.

630
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:39,020
Heo Yoon Do already hid Judge Lee away.

631
01:00:39,020 --> 01:00:44,040
He wants to ask for a retrial and put Judge Lee on the witness stand...

632
01:01:06,350 --> 01:01:11,450
  I'm very glad the surgery went well for your wife. 

633
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:21,720
 Our relationship was just this once, and now it's over.  

634
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:26,340
 For the rest of my life, please let me live my life according to my own beliefs. 

635
01:01:28,290 --> 01:01:30,980
 What are you planning to do? 

636
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:36,390
 I'm going to resign and go to the States. 

637
01:01:37,980 --> 01:01:42,070
 Good. Do so. 

638
01:01:44,830 --> 01:01:50,900
If he had kept the investigation report that came from the prosecutors....

639
01:01:59,690 --> 01:02:06,560
I feel guilty toward Head Chairman, but it will be hard for me to give testimony.

640
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:10,050
My son is also working for MC Group.

641
01:02:10,050 --> 01:02:14,400
I don't want my family in danger.

642
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:16,720
I'm sorry, Miss.

643
01:02:18,120 --> 01:02:20,270
I see....

644
01:02:21,110 --> 01:02:23,900
I'm sure you're scared of Director Han.

645
01:02:26,590 --> 01:02:31,430
Sorry that I can't help.

646
01:02:34,010 --> 01:02:40,600
I didn't think Dr. Hwang would give testimony so easily. Don't be discouraged.

647
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:45,660
Of course. I can't be disappointed with something like this.

648
01:02:45,660 --> 01:02:48,800
And I gained something unexpected as well...

649
01:02:49,780 --> 01:02:52,280
- Gained something unexpected? 
 - Yeah.

650
01:02:52,280 --> 01:02:55,020
Of course, I need to verify it.

651
01:02:55,020 --> 01:02:57,780
- Verify? 
 - Yeah.

652
01:03:00,500 --> 01:03:03,650
What are you doing, not taking off already?

653
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:06,520
Oh, yeah.

654
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:55,940
Director, everything is ready.

655
01:03:57,850 --> 01:04:00,410
Be on standby.

656
01:04:36,320 --> 01:04:39,020
   Director Han   

657
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:49,650
Yes, Director.

658
01:04:51,130 --> 01:04:53,180
I understand.

659
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:53,360
You summoned me?

660
01:05:53,360 --> 01:05:56,170
Park Tae Ho.

661
01:06:03,670 --> 01:06:06,810
So, what is your plan?

662
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:20,130
I'll ask for a retrial for the incident that happened 15 years ago,

663
01:06:20,130 --> 01:06:24,190
and I'm going to punish everyone involved without fail.

664
01:06:24,190 --> 01:06:26,260
Even you, Director.

665
01:06:26,260 --> 01:06:31,000
No, there is nothing you can do.

666
01:06:32,460 --> 01:06:42,020
Is that... the first words you should be saying as the very person responsible for locking up an innocent person for 15 years?

667
01:06:42,760 --> 01:06:49,050
How much pain my mother must have gone through for those long 15 years...

668
01:06:49,050 --> 01:06:54,590
and how I lived after losing my mother unfairly...

669
01:06:54,590 --> 01:06:57,320
you've never once thought about those things, have you?

670
01:06:58,110 --> 01:07:00,370
"I'm sorry"!

671
01:07:01,160 --> 01:07:04,190
Shouldn't you say those words first?

672
01:07:04,190 --> 01:07:06,190
if you're a human being?

673
01:07:06,190 --> 01:07:12,150
"I'm sorry." Those are the words that can never come out of a lawyer's mouth.

674
01:07:13,420 --> 01:07:18,790
But then again, I'm not sure if you can continue to be a lawyer.

675
01:07:18,790 --> 01:07:23,810
Getting a retrial isn't easy. On top of that, you don't even have concrete proof.

676
01:07:26,300 --> 01:07:28,370
Who knows?

677
01:07:28,370 --> 01:07:30,340
"Who knows" you say?

678
01:07:30,340 --> 01:07:38,110
In your eyes, I might seem trivial, but I will never give up.

679
01:07:38,110 --> 01:07:43,570
Since I'm not rash or impatient.

680
01:07:47,240 --> 01:07:50,220
Retrial can only be requested by the one who received the guilty sentence,

681
01:07:50,220 --> 01:07:56,950
or her proxy, her spouse, close relatives or siblings.

682
01:07:56,950 --> 01:08:01,040
Your mom doesn't have a husband nor does she have brothers or sisters.

683
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:03,930
She only has you, her son.

684
01:08:03,930 --> 01:08:08,960
Sadly, by law, you are not her son.

685
01:08:09,790 --> 01:08:16,600
The good thing is that you might not be her son but her lawyer, so a retrial is possible.

686
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:22,810
You're the only lawyer who can save your mother.

687
01:08:22,810 --> 01:08:24,120
So?

688
01:08:24,120 --> 01:08:27,310
Try to care about yourself.

689
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:33,390
Heo Yoon Do,

690
01:08:34,340 --> 01:08:37,920
You are arrested for forging your identity.

691
01:08:46,450 --> 01:08:48,910
You have a right to an attorney.

692
01:08:48,910 --> 01:08:54,590
You have a chance to explain yourself and you have the right to appeal at the time of detention.

693
01:08:59,530 --> 01:09:06,720


694
01:09:06,720 --> 01:09:09,550
♫  Black Diamond  ♫

695
01:09:12,150 --> 01:09:17,660
♫  You and I to that place  ♫

696
01:09:17,660 --> 01:09:20,360
♫  Black Diamond  ♫

697
01:09:23,240 --> 01:09:29,150
♫  The Paradise for just the two of us  ♫

698
01:09:34,030 --> 01:09:38,260
 I think you should tell me why Laywer Heo isn't here. 

699
01:09:38,260 --> 01:09:41,640
 Just remember that TOP is always beyond your imagination. 

700
01:09:41,640 --> 01:09:43,600
 You're a more dramatic enemy than I thought. 

701
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:46,300
 Aren't you embarrassed for cleaning after MC Group from generation to generation?  

702
01:09:46,300 --> 01:09:47,460
  This jerk has gone mad. 

703
01:09:47,460 --> 01:09:50,020
 Are you an incompetent prosecutor or were you always a dirty prosecutor? 

704
01:09:50,020 --> 01:09:53,350
 Who dare you treat my son as a criminal and dismiss him?!  

705
01:09:53,350 --> 01:09:56,460
 Will you be able to handle Director Han? 

706
01:09:56,460 --> 01:10:02,130
 If you don't let Lawyer Heo go and lock up Director Han, I'll get rid of you first.
