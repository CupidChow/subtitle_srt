00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,300
 Graceful Family 

2
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,200
 Episode 6  
  Approximatly 15 years earlier 

3
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,410
Is it good?

4
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:37,680
Yes. It's tastier since we came here together.

5
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,130
Mom doesn't let me eat hamburgers.

6
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:42,920
Do whatever you want to do today.

7
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:45,700
- Really? 
 - Of course.

8
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:48,050
What do you want to do?

9
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:51,350
My friends went to see the football game with their dads.

10
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:56,400
Grandfather, it's dirty!

11
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:01,480
No. Your food is not dirty to me. It's fine.

12
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,460
Then should we go to the football stadium together?

13
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:07,380
- Really? Then let's go right away! 
 - Okay!

14
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:08,960
I'll take that.

15
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:16,400
I'll do it.

16
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,160
It's okay.

17
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:28,950


18
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,860
 To a girl who couldn't live with her dad, 

19
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:38,000
 grandfather was more than a father. 

20
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:44,680
You worked so hard raising Seok Hui without a father.

21
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:48,610
She's a very smart and a kind-hearted kid, Father.

22
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:57,190
You're the rightful lady of the house. It's time you moved in.

23
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,570
Chairman is coming.

24
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:41,220
Seok Hui's mother is a member of the Mo family.

25
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:47,330
Move into the house with Seok Hui.

26
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:49,330
I'll do that.

27
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:54,780
Hey. You move out.

28
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:56,600
Father!

29
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:01,260
Move into the house and study management.

30
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:05,730
Grandfather, I don't think that would be much fun.

31
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:10,170
Father, we have an eldest son. Why Seok Hui?

32
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:12,570
Do you know what times we're living in? What do you mean an eldest son?

33
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:15,360
Are those two good enough in your eyes?!

34
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:23,620
Seok Hui.

35
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,980
 Being overly loving toward one brings out jealousy,  

36
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:44,520
 disenchantment, and rage to others. 

37
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:48,560
You seem to have a lot of special affection for Seok Hui.

38
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,380
She's a special kid. The backbone of our family.

39
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:58,870
I'm going to raise Seok Hui as someone who will take over our company.

40
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:02,530
You're also a woman who's living like a great man!

41
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:08,790
MC Construction is in talks with a company in the Middle East about a huge project.

42
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:09,550
And?

43
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:12,700
Provided that Director Mo Cheol Hui becomes the group's CEO

44
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:16,230
they are going to approve.

45
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:20,450
Also, all the executives and staff members of the company believes the director to be the successor.

46
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:23,390
so if you choose Miss as the successor all of a sudden,

47
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:26,040
it would negatively hurt the company.

48
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,320
It's a useless worry.

49
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,000
Chairman.

50
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:32,490
I've already made up my mind.

51
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:39,610
 From the Chairman's wish not to lose something precious to him 

52
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:42,770
 and Director Han's betrayal 

53
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:46,570
 could the tragedy of MC Group have started? 

54
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:05,440
 Graceful Family 

55
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,670
 Present 

56
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,590
We're doing a DUI check.

57
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:28,480
You've been drinking.

58
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:31,160
Pardon? I...

59
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:39,960
Give me your license.

60
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:46,230
 East Police Station 

61
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,320
Hello, I'm her attorney.

62
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:10,180
She has a provisional driver's license right now?

63
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:13,280
Yes, that's right. So it's not driving without a license.

64
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,910
Because she drove under the influence,

65
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:19,590
she was waiting to get a license suspension, but she drove again under the influence.

66
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:21,730
You know that after two times, you're out, right?

67
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:22,830
I think there's a misunderstanding.

68
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:26,820
Call a doctor. I'll sign.

69
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:29,570
I have an illness.

70
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:32,260
Wait, wait, wait.

71
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:35,020
I'm sorry. Could we talk privately?

72
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:49,690
I have a deja vu with a place like this.

73
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:53,190
Why aren't you angry? It's unlike you.

74
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:55,930
You should be upset that I've been drinking.

75
00:06:56,890 --> 00:06:58,970
Did you really drink?

76
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:05,010
The article about my DUI is up already.

77
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:08,670
Like someone planned and waited for it.

78
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:13,120
Why did they do a DUI check this morning all of a sudden?

79
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,540
In front of my house at that.

80
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:19,440
How did the reporters know about my DUI quicker than you?

81
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:26,440
So... someone planned this so that you couldn't come to the shareholders' meeting?

82
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,890
Who would it have been?

83
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:29,470
TOP.

84
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:36,130
I... suffer from a condition called auto brewery syndrome.

85
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:39,200
- Auto brewery syndrome? 
 - Yes.

86
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,810
It's a condition where the carbohydrates turn into alcohol.

87
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:44,890
Um... that's a real thing?

88
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:49,310
You don't die or anything. It started last year.

89
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:54,500
I came to Korea suddenly while getting treated for it in the States, so I couldn't bring my medicine with me.

90
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:59,450
I hadn't gone to a hospital here since I was afraid TOP would find out and use it against me.

91
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:03,990
Then the DUI last time, too, that was because of this illness?

92
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:05,560
Yes.

93
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:10,550
 "Auto Brewery Syndrome" (also gut fermentation disease) is a real medical condition 

94
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:48,600
They must have put something in my juice that I drink every day. Like some carbohydrate powder or something...

95
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,890
So TOP found out about it after all...

96
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:54,450
What happened at the meeting?

97
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,510
Your appointment as CEO got cancelled.

98
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:04,950
In the end, did my father become the CEO?

99
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:22,720
The medical records from the treatments she received in the States and her medical diagnosis.

100
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,560
We'll submit a medical diagnosis from a national hospital after an examination, too.

101
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:50,050
The shareholders pushed for Chairman Mo Cheol Hui as the CEO at the meeting.

102
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:52,630
I apologize.

103
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:54,690
Then what happens to Miss?

104
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:57,690
Since the reasons for disqualification were revealed at an official appearance,

105
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:02,610
I think it'll be difficult to appoint her as the CEO.

106
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,740
Chairman! Chairman, are you okay?

107
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:10,430
Chairman! Chairman!

108
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:12,760
Doctor Hong, call 911!

109
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:15,720
Chairman! Chairman!

110
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,640
How is he?

111
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,970
He's of advanced age and already has problems with his heart as well as blood vessels,

112
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:33,170
so it would be best for him to get stabilized at the hospital.

113
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,620
I did what I could urgently,

114
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:39,700
but he needs complete stabilization.

115
00:10:56,930 --> 00:10:59,990
 Doctor Hong was at the house. 

116
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,560
 Doctor Hong was at the house. 

117
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,590
- How is the media's reaction? 
 - Take a look.

118
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:14,390
MC Groups new rising star, caught for DUI on the day of stockholders' meeting, moral laxity of Chaebols,

119
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:17,860
A radical club maniac heiress who is pro same-sex marriage.

120
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:19,400
The media is having a field day.

121
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:23,970
She made her debut internationally. Not a positive one, of course.

122
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:25,890
What about articles on the fight for management rights?

123
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:27,090
There are none so far.

124
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:28,900
- Keep up the defense. 
 - Yes.

125
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:31,310
What do you predict Head Chairman's stance will be?

126
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:34,170
He'll probably drag out the fact that Chairman Mo has been  elected CEO.

127
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:37,140
Although Miss isn't the CEO, she is the largest shareholder.

128
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,970
They might sue us.

129
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:41,000
Yes, there is a good possibility.

130
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,390
They'll insist that the decision to appoint a CEO without the major shareholder is procedurally problematic.

131
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:48,410
You could be charged with coercion in obtaining the stockholders' proxies.

132
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:49,200
What's the alternative?

133
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,540
Even if they decide to file a suit, it'll take a while.

134
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:55,250
We have to obtain more shares as quickly as possible in the meantime.

135
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:56,080
Okay.

136
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:59,030
Director, what are you going to do with Lawyer Heo?

137
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:02,790
His internship has ended, so is there's a point of keeping him around at TOP?

138
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:06,850
I'll take care of that myself.

139
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:08,200
Yes.

140
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:39,020
  Auto Brewery Syndrome  

141
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:44,390
 After proving her innocence for a year, she was released on the 8th. The guardian has stated that her body is like a distillery.  

142
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:55,870
I think it'll take time.

143
00:12:55,870 --> 00:13:01,120
They have to take more blood, too. People are interested since it's a rare condition.

144
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:04,960
Submit it to the police station as soon as the results come out.

145
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:11,080
Does the grandfather... know?

146
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:15,970
I talked to Lawyer Yoon and he was told.

147
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,010
I messed it all up.

148
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:36,990
Congratulations to  our CEO!!

149
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:40,950
This is a special alcohol that I  saved for a day like this. Love shot!

150
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:43,440
Hey, that's embarrassing.

151
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:53,500
From now on, take care of Soek-Hui too.

152
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:57,990
Of course, she is also my daughter.

153
00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:03,040
But when will you do the personnel changes within the Group?

154
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:08,800
Executive Director Han will bring me a draft.

155
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,670
Director Han?

156
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:13,090
MC group is yours.

157
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:15,950
They say you put new alcohol into a new unit. (  Old Biblical  saying about not putting new wine into old bottles) 

158
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:21,450
While you're at it, consider changing the head of TOP.

159
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:23,730
I find that woman really burdensome.

160
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:25,710
Terrible!!

161
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:40,120
My son? How have you been?

162
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:43,490
Oh, my baby... Did you miss me?

163
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:45,920
Of course!

164
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,130
Okay let's see... Have you eaten?

165
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:50,580
Yes.

166
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:54,920
But, why did you suddenly ask to to see me?

167
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,330
By any chance, is anybody in that house tormenting you?

168
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:59,790
No. It's okay.

169
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:01,560
My son.

170
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:07,510
Aigoo... Chae Na Ri, long time no see

171
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:10,210
Did you guys come together?

172
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:11,760
Yes.

173
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:16,360
Why? Is there some sign prohibiting our seeing each other?

174
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,560
I came here because I have something to say.

175
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,710
What do you need to say?

176
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,420
Invest in my movie.

177
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:34,770
Invest... out of nowhere?

178
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:36,930
I don't have money to do that.

179
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:37,980
Even if I did, I wouldn't.

180
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,900
You've recently done three CF (Commercial Shoots).

181
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,570
Oppa.....!

182
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:47,030
Anyway, I don't have money.

183
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:53,630
Then, can you ask Dad for it?

184
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:58,880
Seok Hui promised to invest but I think that offer is off the table now.

185
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,180
I'm desperate.

186
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:04,620
Please ask Dad.

187
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:06,470
Why do you live like this?

188
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:09,940
Let's age gracefully.

189
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:17,170
If you don't help me this time, I have another plan.

190
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:21,110
I will tell everyone about us dating.

191
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:24,280
Have you gone crazy?

192
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:28,920
Ah.... I'm hungry.

193
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,320
Thank you.

194
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:35,220
Seo Jin, you need to order.

195
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:41,360
My nephew ... is quite handsome, isn't he?

196
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:45,610
What do you want auntie to buy for you?

197
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:05,060
Bye.

198
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,650
By the way...

199
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:19,840
- look at this when you get in. 
 - What is it?

200
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:21,620
You will know when you see it.

201
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:26,640
Go in, I'll drop the car and leave.

202
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:38,380
 I Took Your Name As Medicine by Park Joon 

203
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,800
Sorry.

204
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,250
There is no need to be sorry.

205
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:51,120
This hasn't come to an end yet.

206
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,990
You don't know what it took to make this happen for you...

207
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:58,700
He said it's not the end yet.

208
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,720
But, is Grandfather seriously ill?

209
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:11,720
I have security measures in place as well...

210
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:15,960
so be strong and prepare for it.

211
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,560
Yes.

212
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:33,000
God seems to have granted you all the good fortune.

213
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:37,550
Since strong Seok Hui also has fallen,

214
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:40,610
now you are the only heir left.

215
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:44,450
Brother-in-law, don't you know he's very sensitive?

216
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:46,770
The dinner is late as it is,

217
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:49,270
so please stop.

218
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:52,040
Dinner isn't the issue right now.

219
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:54,610
When my movie is on the verge of failure.

220
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:56,240
So,

221
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:59,110
what is it you want?

222
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:01,890
Give me some money! Please!

223
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:05,500
We're going to lose all our staff from the shooting site!

224
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:13,020
You're okay overall, but I think you lack humanity.

225
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:15,940
A cold guy who doesn't bleed even when pricked...

226
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:18,010
That's completely out of style.

227
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:21,840
A next generation leader needs to be sensitive.

228
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:25,750
Younger brother, save your hyung's face.

229
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:28,510
Wan Joon, Wan Joon!!

230
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:30,660
Aren't you embarrassed?

231
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,650
- Why? 
 - Just...

232
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:38,270
accept the fact that you have no talent.

233
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:42,160
Owning up to that fact is enough to gauge your worth.

234
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:48,090
You heartless son of a bitch. Aren't you so great.

235
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:53,670
If you covet the company, then take it!

236
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:58,210
At least become that competent or just keep your mouth shut.

237
00:19:58,210 --> 00:20:00,000
What did you just say?

238
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:05,460
- Just because I let it slide all the time-- 
 - Why are you doing this?

239
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:07,460
"Why are you doing this??

240
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:11,440
This couple is heartless together, huh?

241
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,540
It's real marital harmony.

242
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:17,720
What a beautiful scene... amongst brothers.

243
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:22,250
Hey, Mo Seok Hui! You should have done your job properly!

244
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:25,400
I had all my faith in you! My movie is about to be ruined. What are you gonna do about it?

245
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,680
What are going to do about it?!

246
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,780
I know, right? I feel bad.

247
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:31,520
Try to hang in there by spending less on your drinking habits.

248
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,640
Oh My God!!

249
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:39,120
How can no one in this family understand art?

250
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:45,440
If I don't have a drink right now, I'm going to be committed to a mental institution.

251
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:53,000
Although Oppa Wan Soo may not be at your level to be competing with,

252
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,720
there's no need to be so rude, no? After all you're siblings.

253
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,820
You two are similar.

254
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:01,730
Why don't you give collaboration with him a try as half-siblings?

255
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:07,630
If you corner him, he could bite.

256
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:10,380
Really?

257
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:15,980
Wow, now that I think about it, it really scares me!

258
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:34,740
The internet is going crazy talking about the chaebol family's only daughter.

259
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:36,860
It's that girl from last time, right?

260
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:41,750
But she is nice and pretty and so smart.

261
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:44,270
Why did she drink and drive?

262
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:46,550
Drunk driving is no different than murder.

263
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:48,860
You definitely should't do it even if you are going to die.

264
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:52,260
Dad, you shouldn't believe in everything the news says.

265
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:54,790
If I don't believe the news then, who am I to believe?

266
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:57,320
These days, there are lots of fake news as well.

267
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:01,240
I heard she drank all night so she wasn't sober even by morning.

268
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:04,630
How much did she drink that in the morning she still couldn't pass the breathalyzer test?

269
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:07,710
Seriously... I said it's not true!!

270
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:16,230
 I Took Your Name As Medicine by Park Joon 

271
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:24,020
  Thinking about your sorrow in a miserable world ... 

272
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:26,910
Lawyer Heo is quite impressive.

273
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:29,330
I like this poem.

274
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,440
Hello?

275
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,090
Have you read the poem?

276
00:22:57,090 --> 00:22:59,210
Do you know what time it is right now?

277
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:01,650
Did you call me to ask that?

278
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:03,020
It's daytime in New York.

279
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:05,790
So, you want to get revenge?

280
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:07,650
As if..

281
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:09,960
I was wondering if you read the poem.

282
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,360
- It's a poem I like. 
 - Really?

283
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:18,030
When we share common likes to this degree, aren't we almost like siblings who are blood related?

284
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:24,090
I'm thinking of your sorrow in this miserable world.

285
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:30,160
Thinking  about your sorrow in a miserable world  is as remote as

286
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:34,700
the land  losing its homes and the homes losing their occupants.

287
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:40,830
Can you sing one more time for me?

288
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:45,780
Never mind. f you go overboard one more time, I'm going to do a flying kick.

289
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:51,230
- That's a relief. 
 - What?

290
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:54,020
It is the Mo Seok Hui I know.

291
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:56,730
Sleep well.

292
00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:20,600
Take a look.

293
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:25,900
I'll submit it.

294
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:32,880
  A New Movement, The Prosecution Growing Together 

295
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:43,540
What happened?

296
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:47,320
Miss Seok Hui just filed a lawsuit,

297
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:52,340
saying that we coerced the shareholders into signing the proxies. We are being sued for coercion.

298
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:55,150
There's also suspicion of violating the Capital Market Act.

299
00:24:55,150 --> 00:24:58,270
The dates of when the proxies from shareholders were received are all different.

300
00:24:58,270 --> 00:25:01,630
Article 153 of the capital market and stock market investment law.

301
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:04,930
Breach and disclosure violation of proxy and reference documents.

302
00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:07,050
Seok Hui is a lot more thorough than she looks.

303
00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:09,290
It's probably that her will to be the CEO is that strong.

304
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:10,450
It was expected.

305
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:12,840
Right now, the Head Chairman is meeting with the directors.

306
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:18,200
Choi Kyeong Oh, Sin Oh Cheol, Baek Jong Hn... just assembling  three would be enough to convene an emergency council.

307
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:21,620
Director Baek came over to our side. Did you get that info from the other side?

308
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:23,780
Yes.

309
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:26,090
Convene an emergency council...

310
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:30,560
Remove Chairman Mo by convincing the board of directors and then go for it again?

311
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:33,070
Should we send those three people overseas for the time being?

312
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:35,020
No, wait.

313
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:36,710
The fact that they made contact with Director Baek means that

314
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:39,470
even if that information is leaked, they're that confident.

315
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:44,200
Then that means the other two have already taken their side.

316
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,760
Find out exactly where and when the meeting will take place!

317
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:51,590
Yes.

318
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:56,140
No. Use Director Baek and steer the conference to take place at his place of residence.

319
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:57,780
Why is that?

320
00:25:58,570 --> 00:26:02,960
If something bad happened outside, no good can come of it.

321
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:12,960
Emergency council...

322
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:17,240
Greed never gets old...

323
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:19,410
Tenacious...

324
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,690
Chairman...

325
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:28,690
Head Chairman is coming.

326
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,570
Leave.

327
00:26:54,990 --> 00:27:00,160
Appoint Seok Hui... as the CEO.

328
00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:06,300
Something that was decided at the shareholders' meeting...

329
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:10,630
how can I change it myself?

330
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:15,290
You will be severely punished for that greed of yours.

331
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:20,510
If you play any more tricks, I will not l leave you be.

332
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:24,420
This is still my home.

333
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:27,860
Let's go.

334
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:55,880
You should have been left as a judge.

335
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,680
My karma is great.

336
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:26,680
Now... it's not possible anymore.

337
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:30,500
I'm sick of it.

338
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:35,630
It's been a while, but there was a time I hit the jackpot.

339
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:37,840
It started as something fun with $100,

340
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:41,370
but quickly only a $1 coin was left.

341
00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:46,270
There was a passing thought of walking away, but the coin was inserted without care...

342
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:49,530
and that gave me the jackpot.

343
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:53,860
A $1 coin changed my fate.

344
00:28:55,330 --> 00:29:00,360
A gambler shouldn't be in possession of even a dollar.

345
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:05,050
Living a long time with an illness,

346
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,910
is an embarrassment to a family.

347
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:41,220
Sorry while you're resting.

348
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:44,530
It's good manners not to do something you'll be sorry for.

349
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:48,920
Do you think you can overturn the decision if you convene an emergency council?

350
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:52,990
I don't like playing games where there's no chance of winning either.

351
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:58,310
Where did that innocent Miss from years ago disappear to?

352
00:29:58,310 --> 00:30:00,350
I wonder.

353
00:30:01,130 --> 00:30:06,190
That Seok Hui probably died in New York when she was about 20 years old.

354
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:09,570
You should know very well...

355
00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:13,650
Since you and MC Group killed her.

356
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:20,140
Miss, how long do you think Head Chairman will be by your side?

357
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:24,420
If you don't let go of your ambition, it might put him in an awkward position.

358
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:26,390
Are you threatening me?

359
00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:30,370
If I can just get MC Group in my hands,

360
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:32,310
whether he dies or not doesn't matter to me.

361
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:34,820
He's already advanced in age.

362
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,510
Why are you surprised?

363
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:43,460
If I am to fight against you people, I have to think and act the same.

364
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:45,630
Since this is how you work.

365
00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:47,120
How impressive.

366
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,450
I'll take that as a compliment.

367
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:08,730
 Medical Records 

368
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:14,280
It's a medical report on Mo Seok Hui's auto brewery syndrome.

369
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:18,480
My lacking son used Seok Hui's illness as a

370
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,660
reason for disqualification.

371
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:27,000
It's an embarrassment to my family. I can't apologize enough.

372
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:30,690
As written in the doctor's notes,

373
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:35,650
if I control my diet, it doesn't have any effect on my daily life.

374
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:40,920
Lawyer Heo, please pass out the proposal.

375
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:53,430
 MC Group Management Strategy Plan 

376
00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:57,170
It's my thought on what direction MC Group needs to

377
00:31:57,170 --> 00:31:59,590
go in the future.

378
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:01,910
Also, the file that's attached to the back is

379
00:32:01,910 --> 00:32:06,070
her certificate from New York University Stern School of Business.

380
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:10,770
A news article came out today about how she graduated with excellent grades.

381
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:19,320
Now, now, let's eat

382
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:23,970
and take our time listening to her briefing.

383
00:33:02,910 --> 00:33:06,050
She can't make another mistake again.

384
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:09,550
So, the menu is meat.

385
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:11,750
Please understand.

386
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:13,350
Please.

387
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:35,340
Head Director's condition is very serious.

388
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:38,860
Please be specific.

389
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:41,830
He's of advanced age and his spine isn't in good health,

390
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:47,230
so even if his sympathetic nerves is stimulated, it can result in neurological shock.

391
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,690
The sauce is very good.

392
00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:02,270
It's tasty. What is it?

393
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:04,660
It's almond sauce.

394
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:06,960
Grandfather, eat a lot slowly.

395
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,560
Okay.

396
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:16,290
Put some more on.

397
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:17,900
That's good.

398
00:34:39,890 --> 00:34:42,380
 The dinner is coming to an end. 

399
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:08,170
Yes.

400
00:35:08,170 --> 00:35:11,090
Let me speak to Head Chairman.

401
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:20,330
Grandfather, Director Han has something to tell you.

402
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:29,190
What is it?

403
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,760
Grandfather...

404
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:48,400
Grandfather!

405
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:55,160
Grandfather!

406
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,910
Grandfather!

407
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:16,660
 His heart wasn't great to begin with. 

408
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:19,650
 Recently it's become weaker, 

409
00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:22,650
 so he has to be very careful with his diet. 

410
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:26,820
 Food that's okay for healthy people can become poison to him. 

411
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:31,300
 For example, nuts with a small amount of almond butter  

412
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:33,220
 can affect the heart, 

413
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:35,210
 so it's best to avoid it. 

414
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:38,640
 He received a great shock at the shareholders' meeting 

415
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:41,290
 so if there's another shocking incident, 

416
00:36:41,290 --> 00:36:44,810
 he'll probably have difficulty recovering from it. 

417
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,710
He has passed away.

418
00:38:09,310 --> 00:38:13,210
Make the funeral

419
00:38:13,210 --> 00:38:14,610
as elaborate as possible.

420
00:38:14,610 --> 00:38:16,740
We can't.

421
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:21,730
If people find out that as soon as you became the CEO

422
00:38:21,730 --> 00:38:25,960
the Head Chairman passed away, there could be an unwanted dispute.

423
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:29,500
Also, the stock fell 7.8% after the shareholders' meeting,

424
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:34,130
so the shareholders aren't in a good mindset. Please have a private funeral instead.

425
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:37,700
You're right.

426
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:40,270
I'll prepare it that way.

427
00:40:23,410 --> 00:40:26,720
A moment of silence.

428
00:41:12,050 --> 00:41:17,000
 Mo Wang Pyo.  

429
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:36,840
 Director Han! 

430
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:41,330
 We developed the first ship that could hold 6200 containers 

431
00:42:41,330 --> 00:42:43,360
 20 m tall in the world! 

432
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:47,560
 From now on,  MC  through its products will roam around all oceans of the world. 

433
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:49,380
 Congratulations. 

434
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:53,710
 This is all because you went to Kuwait and won a hundred million dollars in contracts. 

435
00:42:53,710 --> 00:42:55,560
 So I'm glad I have you behind my back! 

436
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:37,110
 Mo Wang Pyo: September 3, 1932- September 9, 2019 
 He lies here to rest after a lifetime of tirelessly running forward 

437
00:43:43,990 --> 00:43:46,250
But, you know...

438
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:52,650
what did Director Han say to him before he died?

439
00:43:54,230 --> 00:43:58,800
He received her call and was shocked.

440
00:44:00,910 --> 00:44:03,940
She caused him to die from shock.

441
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:15,580
All the people I have loved are gone.

442
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:21,190
Now I am really alone.

443
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:55,260
The Head Chairman was buried at the arboretum.

444
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:57,820
You all worked hard.

445
00:44:57,820 --> 00:45:01,340
It's surprising. I never expected that he would pass away like this.

446
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:06,110
He was hanging in there for his granddaughter. It seems like the shock at the shareholders' meeting was too great.

447
00:45:06,110 --> 00:45:08,750
It's the end for Miss Seok Hui, right?

448
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:12,960
No, right now, she has the largest share.

449
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,800
That's why you have to be on your toes.

450
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:17,490
Until the Group stabilizes under Chairman Mo,

451
00:45:17,490 --> 00:45:20,180
our work isn't done.

452
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:27,660
You two worked so hard for a long time for MC Group.

453
00:45:27,660 --> 00:45:31,590
How could you hold a funeral like this on your own?

454
00:45:31,590 --> 00:45:34,450
It should be enough for you to leave alone.

455
00:45:41,550 --> 00:45:44,800
   

456
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:50,000
It's not enough that you're kicking me out... You are also planning to keep an eye on me forever.

457
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,150
Director Han, you!

458
00:45:51,150 --> 00:45:55,700
You should've retired a long time ago. Please step aside for  your juniors.

459
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:57,430
What?

460
00:45:57,430 --> 00:45:59,360
Please choose.

461
00:46:06,510 --> 00:46:10,850
Embezzlement?  What do you think you are doing?

462
00:46:10,850 --> 00:46:13,450
I didn't use that money but--

463
00:46:18,310 --> 00:46:23,170
I heard the weather in Australia is great this days. You should take a break where your daughter is.

464
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:26,410
Right, housekeeper Jeong.

465
00:46:26,410 --> 00:46:30,210
from now on, you cannot contact Miss Seok Hui in any way.

466
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:33,680
Here,

467
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:36,660
Sign here.

468
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:40,450
If you don't keep your promise, I won't be able to guarantee your safety.

469
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:50,280
 Jeong Yoon Seok 

470
00:47:51,970 --> 00:47:55,420
 Housekeeper Jeong 

471
00:47:56,610 --> 00:48:00,040
The number no longer exists,

472
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:03,840
please check and call again.

473
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:12,350
Lawyer Yoon.

474
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:16,470
 The number no longer exists, 

475
00:48:16,470 --> 00:48:20,340
 please check and call again. 

476
00:49:12,790 --> 00:49:16,990
The chairman of the cheobol group just died.

477
00:49:16,990 --> 00:49:19,280
Did they not provide any food at the funeral?

478
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:25,080
You eat like you've been starving! Slow down or you'll get an upset stomach.

479
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:26,960
They're really ridiculous, though.

480
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:33,140
In what circumstance do you finish the funeral in one day when seven days wouldn't be enough?

481
00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:38,050
It's not like he passed away at a young age. At 88, he lived a long life...

482
00:49:38,050 --> 00:49:40,820
I have never seen a funeral end in one day.

483
00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:42,830
I've never experienced this before in my whole life.

484
00:49:42,830 --> 00:49:45,820
So Dad, there's no need to be jealous of the rich.

485
00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:49,790
Who cares if you're a rich chairman when no one can visit him at the funeral?

486
00:49:50,730 --> 00:49:55,040
You... when I die, do it for three days at the most.

487
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:56,450
Why not ask for seven days?

488
00:49:56,450 --> 00:49:58,430
No, seven days is too long.

489
00:49:58,430 --> 00:50:01,160
Three days is more than enough. Promise me.

490
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:04,550
But... I think that you are going to live longer than me.

491
00:50:04,550 --> 00:50:08,850
This kid... Don't say something like that even if you are joking.

492
00:50:10,530 --> 00:50:12,630
Thank you , Dad.

493
00:50:12,630 --> 00:50:14,080
Why all of sudden?

494
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:16,740
Just thank you for everything.

495
00:50:18,970 --> 00:50:21,730
Do you want some more food?

496
00:50:21,730 --> 00:50:23,510
Enjoy.

497
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:33,720
 MHan Je Gook 

498
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,090
Yes, Director.

499
00:50:44,220 --> 00:50:46,060
Director?

500
00:50:49,190 --> 00:50:53,030
I want to make you TOP's member.

501
00:50:54,670 --> 00:50:59,360
Now that Chairman is dead and Mo Cheol Hui is the CEO of MC Distribution,

502
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:02,910
now the new era of MC Distribution has begun.

503
00:51:02,910 --> 00:51:06,060
TOP, also, to compliment that new era,

504
00:51:06,060 --> 00:51:08,650
needs a new person.

505
00:51:10,170 --> 00:51:12,690
The door to TOP is narrow.

506
00:51:12,690 --> 00:51:15,850
How about you come in when the door is open?

507
00:51:18,620 --> 00:51:19,690
Are you disappointed?

508
00:51:19,690 --> 00:51:20,880
What do you mean by it?

509
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:24,590
You wanted Mo Seok Hui to be the CEO.

510
00:51:27,130 --> 00:51:32,830
Do you think the Miss can lead millions of employees?

511
00:51:32,830 --> 00:51:37,750
That's why, because Mo Seok Hui is not talented enough to lead the company,

512
00:51:37,750 --> 00:51:42,010
because she got in the way of MC's new era you got her drunk?

513
00:51:42,010 --> 00:51:45,780
Is the new way this violent?

514
00:51:53,170 --> 00:51:57,380
Where is your final destination as a lawyer?

515
00:51:57,380 --> 00:52:02,550
I don't think I'm close enough with you to talk about personal matters.

516
00:52:02,550 --> 00:52:07,860
Those who save up nice words and say critical things eventually succeed.

517
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:15,480
Miss is talented and has good qualities but not for management.

518
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:18,720
To manage, the ideal and the reality have to come together in a concise manner,

519
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:21,210
But Miss lacks the sense of reality.

520
00:52:21,210 --> 00:52:24,400
If you are a CEO, given  a reality that you don't like,

521
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:27,140
you have to be able to set yourself aside and compromise.

522
00:52:27,140 --> 00:52:30,020
Do you think she will be able to do it?

523
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:36,800
If Miss were to manage, she might get complimented by the scholars,

524
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:39,250
but it's likely the company would suffer from deficit.

525
00:52:39,250 --> 00:52:41,500
Our ways of thinking are really different.

526
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:45,460
I have watched her longer than you have.

527
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:52,330
If she gives up on the management rights, she could go back to the States.

528
00:52:52,330 --> 00:52:55,730
Or live an affluent life as the only daughter of a wealth family.

529
00:52:55,730 --> 00:52:59,000
Didn't you force her to give up her management rights?

530
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:02,000
Nevertheless, she still has the biggest shares.

531
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,680
I respect the facts.

532
00:53:06,050 --> 00:53:07,810
Let's go.

533
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:25,930
This is where selective TOP members can enter.

534
00:53:25,930 --> 00:53:29,290
At one time, the power of this country came from dominating the military,

535
00:53:29,290 --> 00:53:34,520
But now, high-level information and the technology to deal with it,

536
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:37,390
and capital determines that power.

537
00:53:37,390 --> 00:53:40,230
Search anyone you want.

538
00:53:50,740 --> 00:53:53,050
 Im... 

539
00:53:57,120 --> 00:53:59,950
 Heo Yoon Do 

540
00:53:59,950 --> 00:54:04,330
Now, this time, search using TOP's exclusive ID.

541
00:54:06,590 --> 00:54:08,760
 Heo Yoon Do 

542
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:09,900
 Search results for Heo Yoon Do 

543
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:14,110
I see there are nine Heo Yoon Do's that we manage.

544
00:54:14,110 --> 00:54:16,960
Here, let's look you up.

545
00:54:18,430 --> 00:54:22,680
You've worked part time at over 10 places before you passed the bar.

546
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:27,040
 This is it. The file on the murder would also be somewhere here. 

547
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:29,950
Shouldn't you learn how to work properly, too?

548
00:54:29,950 --> 00:54:35,220
I want you to have and use this place to your heart's content.

549
00:54:39,850 --> 00:54:41,390
Why me?

550
00:54:41,390 --> 00:54:43,150
Because you are new and refreshing.

551
00:54:43,150 --> 00:54:47,140
I'm supposed to be honored but I am Mo Seok Hui's lawyer.

552
00:54:47,140 --> 00:54:50,470
Although Miss is the largest shareholder, there is little she can do.

553
00:54:50,470 --> 00:54:55,550
Are you just going to be a butler lawyer to clean up after the family?

554
00:54:55,550 --> 00:55:00,690
Is working at TOP that much better than working as a butler lawyer?

555
00:55:00,690 --> 00:55:04,040
You know how ambitious you are.

556
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:06,560
Having a goal is also ambition.

557
00:55:07,340 --> 00:55:12,130
I sense tenacity in you.   However I don't know what its goal is.

558
00:55:12,130 --> 00:55:13,230
Are you curious?

559
00:55:13,230 --> 00:55:18,580
No, but I know that working as a butler lawyer isn't your final goal.

560
00:55:18,580 --> 00:55:22,470
I don't know what it is that you want, but if you become a member of TOP

561
00:55:22,470 --> 00:55:24,390
you can achieve everything you want.

562
00:55:24,390 --> 00:55:27,170
Only, as you have taken care of the young lady,

563
00:55:27,170 --> 00:55:30,590
now, you must vigilantly watch her.

564
00:55:30,590 --> 00:55:33,800
So, you want me to choose between TOP and Mo Seok Hue?

565
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:37,810
You know I don't have a hot temper, but I am impatient.

566
00:55:37,810 --> 00:55:40,550
I won't wait long.

567
00:55:40,550 --> 00:55:42,150
Go now.

568
00:55:43,780 --> 00:55:48,900
TOP MC GROUP SECURITY AGENT.

569
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:52,510
MC TOWER.

570
00:56:23,870 --> 00:56:27,690
Look at Seok Hui's class in eating steak even on a day like today.

571
00:56:27,690 --> 00:56:30,190
As I expected, her survival power is go great!

572
00:56:30,190 --> 00:56:33,560
Amazing, Mo Seok Hui.

573
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:36,460
Noona, stay strong.

574
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:40,460
I guess you really like her.

575
00:56:40,460 --> 00:56:42,350
You even know how to console her.

576
00:56:42,350 --> 00:56:44,880
I told you,

577
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:47,300
she is just my type.

578
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:54,030
What to do? I am now worried about your future.

579
00:56:54,030 --> 00:56:55,730
Why?

580
00:57:00,060 --> 00:57:03,850
Miss, the chairman wants to see you.

581
00:57:07,790 --> 00:57:10,580
Miss Seok Hue is entering.

582
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:23,820
The spot occupied by your grandfather's arboreteum is a place I've been coveting for a long time.

583
00:57:23,820 --> 00:57:27,330
Then why didn't you use it as your grave?

584
00:57:28,260 --> 00:57:34,250
The chief monk will take care of everything, the 49th day of mourning as well.

585
00:57:34,250 --> 00:57:37,570
Where did you send Housekeeper Jeong and Lawyer Yoon?

586
00:57:37,570 --> 00:57:40,710
I like that you're bold.

587
00:57:40,710 --> 00:57:42,920
You might be the CEO, but,

588
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:46,270
I hope you are aware that I am still the largest shareholder.

589
00:57:46,270 --> 00:57:49,820
The equity structure changed today.

590
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:58,120
 Current MC Distribution Shares Structure 

591
00:57:58,120 --> 00:58:02,360
I've bought all  the shares of Directors Choi and Sin.

592
00:58:06,390 --> 00:58:10,720
Now I know why everyone keeps saying "Director Han, Director Han".

593
00:58:11,750 --> 00:58:13,250
This is a waiver of management rights.

594
00:58:13,250 --> 00:58:15,460
Why would I sign such a document?

595
00:58:15,460 --> 00:58:18,270
I'm no longer the largest shareholder, so I don't have management rights anyway.

596
00:58:18,270 --> 00:58:21,930
Even if you're not the biggest shareholder,  when you have the amount of shares that you do,

597
00:58:21,930 --> 00:58:24,960
it could interfere with the Chairman's control.

598
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:30,020
Even if you don't interfere, the people around you won't let you just be.

599
00:58:30,020 --> 00:58:35,730
Also, give up the assets you were given by Head Chairman, too.

600
00:58:35,730 --> 00:58:37,630
What did you just say?

601
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:41,090
Director Han!

602
00:58:41,090 --> 00:58:44,090
Miss, coming to Korea after 15 years

603
00:58:44,090 --> 00:58:46,950
you had fun as if you were in a theme park.

604
00:58:46,950 --> 00:58:50,730
It's now time for that theme park to close.

605
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,180
Let me ask you one thing.

606
00:58:58,870 --> 00:59:01,970
Who killed my grandfather?

607
00:59:01,970 --> 00:59:02,720
Mo Seok Hui!

608
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:06,180
Tell me the truth. Then I'll sign it.

609
00:59:06,180 --> 00:59:07,460
I did it.

610
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:09,560
Director Han...

611
00:59:11,510 --> 00:59:14,130
Now... sign it.

612
00:59:14,130 --> 00:59:16,890
  Waiver of MC Global Management Rights  

613
00:59:16,890 --> 00:59:18,540
What do you get if I sign?

614
00:59:18,540 --> 00:59:19,990
Like you lived in the US--

615
00:59:19,990 --> 00:59:21,110
While being watched--

616
00:59:21,110 --> 00:59:23,130
Eat, wear and spend as much as you want.

617
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:26,300
- Only with a card-- 
 - You can live freely.

618
00:59:32,890 --> 00:59:35,460
Let me have Lawyer Heo Yoon Do.

619
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:37,100
- You can't. 
 - Why?

620
00:59:37,170 --> 00:59:41,740
TOP will use him. He will make a decision soon.

621
00:59:49,660 --> 00:59:51,630
I'll think about it.

622
01:00:32,590 --> 01:00:35,180
Come in, Team Leader Gwon.

623
01:00:41,910 --> 01:00:44,520
Sorry, Miss, can you give me your cell phone?

624
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:45,480
What are you doing?

625
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:50,810
Miss. You shouldn't ask sensitive questions.

626
01:00:52,220 --> 01:00:54,380
I'm sorry.

627
01:00:54,380 --> 01:00:57,240
Let go. Let go!

628
01:01:02,730 --> 01:01:06,270
 Who killed...grandfather? 

629
01:01:06,270 --> 01:01:08,880
 Tell me the truth. Then I'll sign. 

630
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:10,320
 Then I'll sign the paper. 

631
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:12,390
 I did it. 

632
01:01:21,460 --> 01:01:24,780
You're the one who killed Head Chairman.

633
01:01:30,050 --> 01:01:35,460
  As long as I get the MC Group in my hands, I don't care whether the grandfather dies or not. 

634
01:01:35,460 --> 01:01:37,860
 He's old anyway. 

635
01:01:45,830 --> 01:01:48,810
Sign the paper.

636
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:02,880
Fine.

637
01:02:04,090 --> 01:02:08,970
I'll sign the paper.

638
01:02:20,290 --> 01:02:21,730
 Memorandum of Relinquishment of Management Rights 

639
01:02:21,730 --> 01:02:25,090
 Mo Seok Hui 

640
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:26,820
Young Master is coming.

641
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,270
Director Han...

642
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:46,560
Get ready for her.

643
01:03:48,590 --> 01:03:51,590
Yes, I understand.

644
01:04:12,890 --> 01:04:13,540
What happened?

645
01:04:13,540 --> 01:04:14,490
It's an emergency situation.

646
01:04:14,490 --> 01:04:16,080
Step aside.

647
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:17,110
What's going on?

648
01:04:17,110 --> 01:04:17,930
Picasso.

649
01:04:17,930 --> 01:04:18,820
What?

650
01:04:18,820 --> 01:04:22,600
Informing all of the team, it's an emergency situation. Emergency situation.

651
01:04:40,070 --> 01:04:43,620
TOP

652
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:13,620
TOP

653
01:05:13,620 --> 01:05:15,580
What is it?

654
01:05:16,300 --> 01:05:19,490
You can't do this to me.

655
01:05:19,490 --> 01:05:22,110
If you have something good, share it with me.

656
01:05:35,350 --> 01:05:38,250
What are you doing, not sleeping?

657
01:05:38,250 --> 01:05:40,570
Wait till you get old. You wake up in the middle of the night.

658
01:05:40,570 --> 01:05:44,350
Since I was already up, I came to see your face.

659
01:05:45,550 --> 01:05:48,410
TOP

660
01:05:50,380 --> 01:05:54,930
Where are you going this early?

661
01:05:58,400 --> 01:05:59,960
Did somebody else die?

662
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:01,080
Picasso.

663
01:06:01,080 --> 01:06:03,350
What? The artist?

664
01:06:03,350 --> 01:06:04,900
That person was still alive?

665
01:06:04,900 --> 01:06:06,430
Dad, I'll be back.

666
01:06:06,430 --> 01:06:08,530
Drive safely.

667
01:06:14,280 --> 01:06:16,410
Picasso?

668
01:06:55,640 --> 01:06:57,970
The list of invitations.

669
01:07:01,010 --> 01:07:02,260
What about the Director of the National Art Museum?

670
01:07:02,260 --> 01:07:06,320
That is... she's abroad right now and the flight schedule isn't working out

671
01:07:06,320 --> 01:07:07,460
so she said it'll be difficult.

672
01:07:07,460 --> 01:07:11,320
Send her a private plane. She adored Picasso.

673
01:07:11,320 --> 01:07:13,240
We have the public's attention.

674
01:07:13,240 --> 01:07:16,130
You can take off the logo and send it.

675
01:07:16,130 --> 01:07:18,340
How about the seat arrangement?

676
01:07:25,480 --> 01:07:29,730
YBS CEO should sit next to MC Construction's President Joo.

677
01:07:29,730 --> 01:07:35,800
And Director Mo should sit behind me and CEO, so that we can introduce him to the people.

678
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:37,860
Yes.

679
01:07:37,860 --> 01:07:40,820
New Minister of Land and Transportation is coming too?

680
01:07:40,820 --> 01:07:42,290
We sent a special invitation.

681
01:07:42,290 --> 01:07:47,640
It turned out well. We should approach him naturally given this opportunity.

682
01:07:47,640 --> 01:07:48,780
What about the food?

683
01:07:48,780 --> 01:07:50,980
MC hotel's chef is going to prepare it.

684
01:07:50,980 --> 01:07:56,160
Change it. It's Picasso's last. He deserves the best.

685
01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:59,810
Use the chef's team we used for the American Embassy party.

686
01:07:59,810 --> 01:08:02,190
Yes.

687
01:08:02,190 --> 01:08:04,790
Make sure you guard well.

688
01:08:04,790 --> 01:08:08,000
- Pay special attention to security. 
 - Yes.

689
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:12,530
Take good care of the funeral.

690
01:08:12,530 --> 01:08:14,680
I understand.

691
01:08:29,630 --> 01:08:31,190
15 years ago, Picasso,

692
01:08:31,190 --> 01:08:34,490
after he became a member of MC family up until now

693
01:08:34,490 --> 01:08:39,240
was the patron saint of MC family who has guarded the growth of the family.

694
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:43,030
The reason why MC group was able to overcome numerous hurdles

695
01:08:43,030 --> 01:08:48,500
was because Picasso protected the family with loyalty.

696
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:55,360
Also, for some of us, Piccaso was a family member and a friend who spent a long time together.

697
01:08:55,360 --> 01:08:59,150
In happiness, in sadness,  in loneliness or when in difficulty,

698
01:08:59,150 --> 01:09:04,980
Picasso was always there during those times.

699
01:09:04,980 --> 01:09:07,690
Even though he has left our side, his efforts and loyalty--

700
01:09:07,690 --> 01:09:11,210
Are you confident you will be as successful as Picasso?

701
01:09:11,210 --> 01:09:12,650
 He will be with us forever. 

702
01:09:12,650 --> 01:09:14,500
I don't know.

703
01:09:14,500 --> 01:09:17,360
I don't think the minister would come to my funeral.

704
01:09:17,360 --> 01:09:18,040
 Our family. 

705
01:09:18,040 --> 01:09:20,600
Picasso is great.

706
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:23,130
Honestly, it's too much.

707
01:09:23,130 --> 01:09:24,670
Rest in peace.

708
01:09:24,670 --> 01:09:26,710
It's culture shock.

709
01:09:26,710 --> 01:09:30,310
By the way, is this the type of funeral for a Chabeol's pet?

710
01:09:30,310 --> 01:09:32,230
I have seen a couple dogs' funerals,

711
01:09:32,230 --> 01:09:35,830
but a fish's funeral, this is the first time with Picasso's.

712
01:09:36,610 --> 01:09:40,780
But you have to see this as not funeral, but business.

713
01:09:47,220 --> 01:09:50,470
Picasso is better off than grandfather.

714
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:57,750
And now, we'll have a one minute of silence for Picasso

715
01:09:57,750 --> 01:10:00,160
who  lived for MC Group family and died.

716
01:10:00,160 --> 01:10:03,050
Everyone, silent tribute.

717
01:10:13,930 --> 01:10:15,760
Directly.

718
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:19,630
Next is a floral tribute for Picasso.

719
01:10:19,630 --> 01:10:22,140
Everyone offers flowers.

720
01:11:03,320 --> 01:11:05,890
♬  Hey, give it to me. Give it to me.  ♬

721
01:11:05,890 --> 01:11:09,500
♬  Give it your best, why don't you try  ♬

722
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:15,860
♬  Hey, give it to me.  ♬

723
01:11:15,860 --> 01:11:19,500
♬ But your best can't hold me back. ♬

724
01:11:24,900 --> 01:11:28,260
Adieu, Fish.

725
01:11:32,730 --> 01:11:38,370
♬ I'm on fire, I'm on fire ♬

726
01:11:42,720 --> 01:11:48,360
  You're liar, you are liar  

727
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:56,990


728
01:11:58,710 --> 01:12:01,760
♬  Black Diamond  ♬

729
01:12:04,240 --> 01:12:09,660
♬  You and I, to that place  ♬

730
01:12:09,660 --> 01:12:12,440
♬  Black Diamond  ♬

731
01:12:12,440 --> 01:12:15,230
♬  Black Diamond  ♬

732
01:12:15,230 --> 01:12:20,750
♬  The paradise of just the two of us  ♬

733
01:12:22,680 --> 01:12:24,500
  Graceful Family  

734
01:12:24,500 --> 01:12:28,160
 Upgrade yourself, Lawyer Heo. If something comes ot it, that's even better. 

735
01:12:28,160 --> 01:12:29,660
 You really gave up on the management rights?! 

736
01:12:29,660 --> 01:12:32,130
 Dad you would be proud. You've got a hardworking Director Han. 

737
01:12:32,130 --> 01:12:33,820
 Have Mo Wan Joon as successor? 

738
01:12:33,820 --> 01:12:34,420
 Hurry up. 

739
01:12:34,420 --> 01:12:36,870
 Chairman, are you that afraid of me? 

740
01:12:36,870 --> 01:12:38,820
 Can you become a TOP member to the bone? 

741
01:12:38,820 --> 01:12:40,780
 Let's open my mom's case again. 

742
01:12:40,780 --> 01:12:42,560
 Let's say there are two secret agents behind this. 

743
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:44,860
 - Why 2 agents? 
 - Mo Seok Hui. 

744
01:12:44,860 --> 01:12:46,890
 Heo Yoon Do died of a car accident? 

745
01:12:46,890 --> 01:12:48,660
  Are you saying Lawyer Heo has been resurrected? 

746
01:12:48,660 --> 01:12:52,660
  Heo Yoon Do, get disarmed now.
