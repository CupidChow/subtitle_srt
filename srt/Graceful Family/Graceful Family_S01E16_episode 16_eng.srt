 Episode 16 

7
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:35,830
 Mother, congratulations on opening your own art gallery. 

8
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:38,010
  Thank you, Son.  

9
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:45,530
 Mom, since MC Art Gallery is a special gallery, 

10
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:49,060
I prepared this.

11
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:51,820
 There's this photography album I'm looking at these days. 

12
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:54,580
 This is such an art. 

13
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:57,200
 Don't make an exhibition focused only on paintings, 

14
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,900
 I think it would be good to give some attention to photography as well. 

15
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:06,200
 What's inside this book is also very touching. 

16
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:10,410
 Gay people can get  wonderful artificial breast implants, 

17
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:14,540
 but they can't hide their masculine shoulder blades. 

18
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:18,110
 "The truth is always behind our backs." 

19
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:21,220
 Isn't this a killer? 

20
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,910


21
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:30,860
  View from the Rear 

22
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:38,770
 What is this blasphemous thing in the morning, gays and whatever! 

23
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:43,160
 And why would you pick such a book? 

24
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,330
 What's wrong with it? 

25
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:47,150
 That's just art. 

26
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:49,920
 All arts aren't the same. 

27
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:59,130
 The gifts sent by the Minister of Culture and Tourism just arrived. 

28
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:02,000
 Really? Open it. 

29
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:14,600
 Oh my God... She chose a wine I like. 

30
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:18,740
 Dear, what about a glass of wine after the opening ceremony? 

31
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:22,330
 Anyway, I hope you'll handle today's schedule well. 

32
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:24,910
 You must come, Ok? 

33
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:26,940
 Ok. 

34
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:36,340
 Father is on an extended business trip. Take care of your own health first. 

35
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:38,440
 What about going out on a walk as a change of pace? 

36
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:42,320
 Anyway, I'm going to go to the movies with Seok Hee later. 

37
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,370
 Good job. 

38
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:46,520
 Come in a bit later. 

39
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:09,350
 Are you going to see that girl? 

40
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:20,020
 Are you really going to bring that girl to this house? 

41
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:27,680
 If even you turn away from me, there's nowhere I can stand. 

42
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,260
 I have 2 Mo family's sons. 

43
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:33,880
 How can you do something like this to me? How? 

44
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,010
 Just stop it. 

45
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:56,260
  Mom, are you okay?  

46
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:00,820
 For the past 20 years, 

47
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:04,440
 I haven't had a peaceful day. 

48
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:09,950
 Other's gaze thinking that I pushed aside the wife... 

49
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:12,530
 Father-in-law's coldness. 

50
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:18,380
 The only thing I could establish in this house, was you two. 

51
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:22,140
 No, only Wan Joon. 

52
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:31,600
 Wan Soo, you weren't material to match MC Group.  

53
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,220
 You, who I hoped would become the most successful... 

54
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:39,460
 You are a failure. 

55
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:43,360
 I cannot abandon you as well. 

56
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:20,460
 What is this blasphemous thing in the morning, gays and whatever! 

57
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:29,180
 That day, Mo family members went to meet one person. 

58
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:37,430
  Don't worry.  

59
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:41,590
  I will keep your secret.  

60
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:46,030
 Your father will never understand you. 

61
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:50,630
 It'll be a difficult decision. 

62
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:57,180
 Whatever decision you take, I hope you will be happy. 

63
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,040
  Thank you.  

64
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:03,650
 In order to keep one's own secret hidden away. 

65
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:05,770
 Opening Celebration -  MC Art Gallery 

66
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:10,660
 You'll go to that woman by all means, is that it? 

67
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:12,500
 Director! 

68
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:17,170
 You have to bid farewell to the VIPs after the banquet ends. 

69
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:20,690
 Since the President isn't here yet, you have to stay here, Director. 

70
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:23,260
 Why do you think the President isn't here yet? 

71
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:28,230
 I'm on the verge of having to part ways with the MC family, so move. 

72
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:37,620
 Look here Ahn Jae Rim, don't hold on to false hope. 

73
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:41,120
 Even when he was by your side, he chose me. 

74
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,470
 The matter between my husband and me will be taken care by us, so just go back 

75
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:48,650
 What? Your husband and you? 

76
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:54,230
 I heard that you were slowly losing your mind and I guess that is true. 

77
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:58,650
 Will MC take back a person who is losing her mind? 

78
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:04,190
 What's more, you in this state, do you have the right to raise Seok Hui? 

79
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:08,850
 Seok Hui...! Don't think of putting even a fingertip on her. 

80
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:10,580
 Get lost right now. 

81
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:14,400
 If you don't want to lose Seok Hee, divorce him. 

82
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:19,020
 Since your relationship to the MC family is now cut off. 

83
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:28,400
 The woman who wanted to become MC's daughter-in-law, to instigate the divorce... 

84
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,810
 Since you said in an interview that you often drink Champagne, 

85
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:04,790
 I brought this wine as a gift. 

86
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:11,930
 I don't know if you will like it. 

87
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:22,320
 This is a book I've been reading lately because I have a lot of interest in art. 

88
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,640
 Have you read this? 

89
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:29,340
 I have. But why did you some to see me? 

90
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,930
 So you have read this. 

91
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:36,450
 As expected of an artist, you're quite something. 

92
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:38,930
 I asked why did you come here. 

93
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,330
 I know it sounds weird me saying this. 

94
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:54,770
 But it's been a while since you broke up with Dad. 

95
00:08:55,650 --> 00:09:01,230
 While you are at it, why don't you just cut it clean? It'll be better for all of us. 

96
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:03,380
 This is a problem for us elders to figure out. 

97
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:10,890
 No. This is our family's, all of our problem. 

98
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,520
 I wish you would leave now. 

99
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,360
 Oh, wait! 

100
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,350
  Please.  

101
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:27,090
  Please divorce him. 

102
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:30,040
  I'll beg like this. 

103
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:34,870
  My mom looks very pitiful. 

104
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:39,930
 I'm watching from the side, but it makes me so upset and sad. 

105
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:44,690
  This is all I can do. 

106
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:49,130
  Get up, and go. 

107
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:51,400
  Please. 

108
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,970
  What if my mom dies like this? 

109
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:57,690
  If my mom dies, you won't take responsibility. 

110
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:00,400
 Why are you behaving so pathetically?! 

111
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:08,480
 Each one of you ... You're all disgusting. 

112
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:13,000
  This is not a place for your family to enter whenever you like. 

113
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,890
  You get it? 

114
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:18,100
  You are the one that does not have the right to come back to the house 

115
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,600
  What?  

116
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:31,960
 You should take care of it cleanly... and go your own way. 

117
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:35,390
 As an artist, why are you so persistent? 

118
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:38,220
 You could leave nicely on good terms. 

119
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:44,390
 Are you being this pathetic because of money? 

120
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:51,400
 The more you do this, the more disgusted I get. 

121
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,960
 You're making the situation even worse. 

122
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:57,200
 So, just go back. 

123
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:15,750
 It got ruined, it's a failure. 

124
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,940
  I can't even throw it. 

125
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:26,260
 It's a failure. Abandon it. 

126
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:31,360
 You're a failure. You're a failure. You're a failure. 

127
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,360
 That I can't even throw away. 

128
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:49,790
 In this world, there's no failure from the start. 

129
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:52,740
 It's made into it one by someone. 

130
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:57,060
 Even God, to his creation, 

131
00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:00,280
 doesn't say they're failures. 

132
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,520
 Then you guys too, 

133
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:08,600
 have you ever tried to fix things? Eh? 

134
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:17,450
 The son wanted to put an end to his mother's anxiety and fear, 

135
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:22,350
  but the ending was an irrevocable tragedy.  

136
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:28,220
 He went in to notify her of the divorce... 

137

 View From The Rear. 

138

 Oh this is the wine I like!  

139
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:09,630
 Director Han, you have to hurry here. 

140
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,350
 It looks like it's our family. 

141
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:51,120
  I will clean it up.  

142
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:14,090
 Madam is looking urgently for you, you have to come back. 

143
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:16,730
  Right now? 

144
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:20,790
  Yes. I understand.  

145
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:29,230
 Chief? This is Han Je Gook. 

146
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:31,670
  I have a favor to ask.  

147
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,840
 That's how the murder got covered up. 

148
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:40,430
 And the case was concealed.

 Final Episode

00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:56,890
For MC Group,

151
00:16:56,890 --> 00:17:01,070
I can't put you in as a leader.

152
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:04,000
Even if I can cover up a murder.

153
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:06,860
What?

154
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,020
Miss Seok Hui's mother...

155
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:13,350
No, Ahn Jae Rim,

156
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,970
you killed her.

Should we check on details of the inaugural ceremony?

00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,720
Global MC is the theme.

00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,490
So?

162
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:49,570
We've established Vice Chairman's interview for Time's cover page,

163
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:52,580
and we're holding a press conference for international reporters.

164
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:55,510
We've booked a news anchor as the host for the inaugural ceremony.

165
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:58,240
We have real-time translators in English, Japanese, Chinese and Spanish,

166
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,010
and we're planning to go live on Youtube.

167
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:01,150
And what about the additional VIPs?

168
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:02,980
The Minister of Strategy and Finance has confirmed,

169
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:07,140
And we're confirming the attendance of Brazil and Mexico's ministers of economy related to our advancement into the Latin American market.

170
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:08,040
You worked hard.

171
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:12,030
Right, MC group documentary video has been checked?

172
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:14,320
Yes. It came out well with good pacing.

173
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,050
We will double up the numbers for security than what we have for our standard events.

174
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:20,960
I was concerned that Master Mo Wan Soo might do something unpredicatable.

175
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,110
That's been taken care of.

176
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:26,770
That's about it for the inaugural ceremony.

177
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:30,380
Have Chairman Mo Cheol Hui's shares  been transferred to Vice President Mo Wan Joon?

178
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:33,990
Yes. We're finalizing the documents.

179
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:36,720
We need to convene a special shareholders' meeting before the inauguration ceremony

180
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,800
- and get approval for the chairman's inauguration. Rush it. 
 - Yes.

181
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:43,680
Til the inaugural ceremony is over, stay alert.

182
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,550
Yes,we will.

183
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:50,110
Now we have to find the culprit among the remaining three suspects.

184
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:53,050
Only Mo Wan Soo doesn't have a motive for murder.

185
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:57,070
Not having a motive and us not knowing about the motive, are two different things.

186
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:59,420
Why don't we talk to the three people?

187
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:02,540
Usually when you hear the testimony, you find the loophole.

188
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:05,890
But, I can't meet Ha Yeong Seo and Mo Wan Joon easily.

189
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:09,200
Then should I reach out to them and ask for an interview?

190
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,110
News Patch?

191
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:15,020
Time Magazine would be something Mo Wan Joon would be interested in.

192
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:19,070
Ah, really... Then what should we do?

193
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:23,310
It's our family, so I'll have to give it a try.

194
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:24,570
Yeah.

195
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:44,440
It's a wine you like, sister-in-law.

196
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,600
  Rheinhessen  

197
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:49,980
You prepared it for me?

198
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:52,720
What are you up to?

199
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,000
On the day my mother was murdered...

200
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,850
there was a wine at the murder scene.

201
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,300
Did you go to see my mother on that day to drink wine together?

202
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:07,460
You don't seem to know me,

203
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:10,270
I only drink wine with people I care about.

204
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:13,370
And she wasn't a person I cared about, right?

205
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:17,780
You can use it as a tool to remove someone you don't like.

206
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:22,310
Honstly, I really wanted to kill your mother.

207
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:26,570
But I couldn't kill her.

208
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:30,640
Because I would have to live as a murderer and that would be too much of a waste.

209
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:34,370
Satisfied?

210
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:55,160
Unfortunately what Ha Yeong Seo is saying sounds true.

211
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:05,860
Did you call me, Aunt Seok Hui?

212
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:09,230
You really have amazing adaptability.

213
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:14,730
As for me, I do have that strong point where I absorb anything like a sponge.

214
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:17,290
But, what's up?

215
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:24,030
Are you maybe the culprit?

216
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:26,030
Do you think that?

217
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:28,740
No.

218
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:32,150
To be honest, it would be nice if you weren't the culprit.

219
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,500
Why?

220
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:40,600
At least, you are my only comfort in this house.

221
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:45,280
What's more, us two we're like family, like other people.

222
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:47,640
Isn't that so?

223
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:52,170
Ah. You have a knack for making someone feel disconcerted.

224
00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:00,990
But... It was revealed that she wasn't your birth mother...

225
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:03,530
Is that still so important to catch the culprit?

226
00:24:03,530 --> 00:24:07,330
Whether she's my birth mother or not, that's not important to me.

227
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:11,360
Mom, as ever and forever, she will always be my mother.

228
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:16,510
For people, you see...

229
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:21,810
To be both pretty and mature, is quite a difficult feat.

230
00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:25,010
But our Aunt Soek Hui has got both.

231
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:32,460
But... When you came on the day of the murder, you were holding a bag.

232
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:34,750
Was I?

233
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:36,830
What were you bringing in?

234
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,770
- It must have been a present? 
 - What, for example?

235
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:43,970
Hmm... She was a painter, you know.

236
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:46,830
Wouldn't I have brought things she might need?

237
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:51,030
What the...

238
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:55,630
You're having suspicions... But you hope I'm not the culprit, is that it?

239
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:57,400
Aunt Seok Hui.

240
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:00,920
If I'm being honest... Yes.

241
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:06,790
You still haven't answered my question.

242
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:13,030
You... You don't have the aptitude to investigate.

243
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:19,110
I am sorry but I really am the culprit.

244
00:25:55,970 --> 00:26:02,100
Give the exact data analysis through my email.

245
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:15,180
When you went to see Mom, how was the atmosphere between you two?

246
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:20,530
How do you think it was?

247
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:26,600
Your mom ... Now she isn't even your mom.

248
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:32,940
Anyway. She was someone of great refinement.

249
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:36,690
She wasn't someone who would underhandedly use someone else's weakness.

250
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:42,550
So... You met her and it ended very peacefully?

251
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:45,830
I'm a rational and practical person, you know.

252
00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:49,570
Miss Han Jae Rim wasn't endangering me.

253
00:26:49,570 --> 00:26:54,120
So why would I commit murder and risk losing everything?

254
00:26:58,810 --> 00:27:01,790
Since it's not the conclusion you wanted, you must be disappointed.

255
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:26,040
Lawyer Heo!

256
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:35,350
What about a drink, today?

257
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:51,200
Here. No.

258
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:02,740
You and I, we seem to have quite a lot in common.

259
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:07,610
In common? Hmm. What would it be?

260
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,570
Mom?

261
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:15,500
Doesn't it look like us two...

262
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:19,180
We wander around looking for our mom?

263
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:25,450
Another one is, your mother is physically far away,

264
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:30,240
and my mother is mentally far away.

265
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:37,200
Talking about it, you must have endured many hardships because of your mom.

266
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,260
Well I can't say it's not the case.

267
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:45,050
So I will definitely find the real culprit.

268
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:48,930
Honestly, if not through this means, my mom and I,

269
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:52,730
there's no way for us to get compensation for the unfair times we had.

270
00:28:55,100 --> 00:29:00,070
Of course... 15 years,

271
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:03,160
it's a really long time.

272
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:10,820
As much as you were hurt, no, more than that,

273
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:13,660
you should become happy, Lawyer Heo.

274
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:18,670
Of course. That's how life can be fair.

275
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:29,040
Ha Yeong Seo, Mo Wan Joon, Mo Wan Soo.

276
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:34,720
These three people are the currently most prominent suspects.

277
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:41,240
But, there's no motive for murder for you.

278
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:43,860
And if I'm more honest,

279
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:48,070
I'd like it if you weren't the culprit.

280
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:51,180
Why?

281
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:54,630
Because you're a good person.

282
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:06,570
If everyone in the world was as transparent as you, how great would it be?

283
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:12,110
Nevertheless  every human being has some duplicity.

284
00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:21,250
Oh, I should go now.

285
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:25,750
I have another drinking appointment, you see.

286
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:28,600
Sure. Go safely.

287
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:36,220
- Lawyer Heo. 
 - Yes.

288
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:49,860
You are quite attractive.

289
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:01,140
Bye.

290
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:08,130
Ah. But I don't want to show my back.

291
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:14,080
People's back... They don't know how to lie, you see.

292
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:18,520
I'm going.

293
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:37,760
Half of one percent  of Chairman Mo Cheol Hui's shares, from today on,

294
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:40,490
have been turned over to you.

295
00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:44,300
With 31.9% as of today, you became the biggest shareholder.

296
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:48,240
Oh my! Good work, Director Han!

297
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,800
But, since you were already doing it, you would have turned over a bigger sum.

298
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:55,060
Mo Wan Soo could make a demand for dereliction of duty.

299
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:58,620
- You should move silently and safely. 
 - Is that so?

300
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:01,990
Director Han will surely take care of it properly.

301
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:05,050
We will convene a special shareholders meeting tomorrow,

302
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:07,630
and plan on winning the appointment of Chairman.

303
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:09,730
You should both participate.

304
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:12,410
Okay. I trust you, Director Han.

305
00:32:12,410 --> 00:32:14,230
Since you're a pro.

306
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:18,200
Now let's prepare for the inauguration.

307
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,840
We should do so.

308
00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:32,820
While my immature sister-in-law is playing the detective,

309
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:36,590
it seems my Wan Joon will become the CEO of MC Group.

310
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:40,830
Mo Wan Joon's shares shouldn't be able to make him the biggest shareholder, though.

311
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:44,970
The result is, he did become the biggest shareholder.

312
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:50,240
So you stole Chairman Mo Cheol Hui's shares again.

313
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:53,200
When he was so against Mo Wan Joon before he collapsed.

314
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:56,400
You stole from an unconscious patient.

315
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:59,980
He is my husband and Wan Joon's father.

316
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:01,590
We are family.

317
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:06,340
It is wrong to say that we stole, don't you think?

318
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:21,630
My gut feeling says Mo Wan Soo is...

319
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:23,040
Why?

320
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:27,700
He was saying a sentence from a book "View From the Rear".

321
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:36,630
  I am sorry but I really am the culprit.  

322
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:39,230
Would he be really the culprit?

323
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:44,320
If Mo Wan Soo really is the culprit...

324
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:48,070
Unfortunately we need to be realistic.

325
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:50,380
With the real culprit we can request a retrial.

326
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:52,330
If Director Han cleaned up the case that day..

327
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:54,720
She must have the evidence and can be charged with obstruction of justice.

328
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,970
We can catch two birds, a retrial and Director Han, with this card.

329
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:02,780
Wan Soo is a strong suspect...

330
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:09,930
Right. Whether we ask him to confess or interrogate him, we need to make a decision.

331
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,930
We should.

332
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:20,140
- But it looks like Mo Wan Joon will soon be appointed as Chairman. 
 - What?

333
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:23,640
Director Han made a move while the CEO Mo Cheol Hee is unconscious.

334
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:26,030
She transferred his shares without his will.

335
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:32,750
As long as you can prove that you are the true daughter of CEO Wang, you can pressure director Han.

336
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:43,050
Mo Seok Hui, by any chance..

337
00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:29,260
On the appointment of Vice-Chairman Mo Wan Joon as Chairman,

338
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:32,650
we will reveal the result of the vote.

339
00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:38,960
As you can see, unanimously

340
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,300
it has been approved.

341
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,610
  Wait a second.  

342
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:20,460
♬   Hey Give it to Me   ♬

343
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:24,100
♬   Give it your best why don't you try   ♬

344
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:30,450
♬   Hey give it to me   ♬

345
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:34,700
♬   but your best can't hold me back   ♬

346
00:36:38,290 --> 00:36:40,430
So you're Director Han.

347
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:49,750
The Grand Chairman was a very obsessively thorough person.

348
00:36:57,350 --> 00:37:03,020
 Genetic Relationship Analysis 
♬   You are liar, you are liar   ♬ 

349
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:05,300
One day he gave that to me

350
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:08,360
and asked me to safeguard it.

351
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:17,130
The Grand Chairman had a really good friend I see.

352
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:21,580
Mo Wang Pyo, that old man.

353
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:25,700
At that time, I told him he was being ridiculous

354
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:28,360
but now I get it.

355
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:31,160
That not just anyone can be Chairman.

356
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:55,380
This is a certificate stating that Mo Seok Hui

357
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:58,990
is the daughter of the deceased Chairman Mo Wang Pyo.

358
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:18,740
This is the current state of MC Group's shares.

359
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:22,910
Vice Chairman Mo Wan Joon has 31.9%, Chairman Mo Cheol Hui has 31.1%,

360
00:38:22,910 --> 00:38:26,240
Mo Wan Soo has 10%, Ha Yeong Seo has 5%.

361
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:29,700
Now that Mo Seok Hui has been confirmed to be the Head Chairman's daughter,

362
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:34,720
she can take possession of 25% of the family's shares.

363
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:38,050
Therefore, Mo Seok Hui has in total 19.5%

364
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:42,350
and Vice Chairman Mo Wan Joon has 23.9%.

365
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:50,380
I am transferring to Mo Seok Hui

366
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:53,660
my 7% of MC Distribution shares.

367
00:38:55,580 --> 00:39:01,000
Then, with a final total of 26.5%,

368
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,660
Mo Seok Hui is now MC Group's top shareholder.

369
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:16,860
If this situation is like this, are you going to vote in Vice Chairman Mo Wan Joon as Chairman?

370
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:36,090
We will postpone today's shareholder vote for now.

371
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:54,330
It is possible with the shares Lawyer Heo possesses.

372
00:39:54,330 --> 00:39:55,600
So, what's the alternative?

373
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:58,230
Even if Seok Hui claims ownership of the estate as the daughter of the Grand Chairman,

374
00:39:58,230 --> 00:40:02,710
if our side doesn't come to an agreement, then the only method is a lawsuit.

375
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:05,630
A lawsuit takes a lot of time.

376
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:07,920
It could take years.

377
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:12,720
In that time, we just need to pull together all the shares that we can.

378
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:15,080
That's a relief.

379
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:18,570
Collect and raise Mo Wan Joon's target amount as soon as possible.

380
00:40:18,570 --> 00:40:20,600
Okay.

381
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:24,840
Even if the appointment ceremony is a little delayed, we are going to go on as planned.

382
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:30,920
For now, we've blocked Mo Wan Joon's appointment to Chairman.

383
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,610
Will Director Han do nothing?

384
00:40:32,610 --> 00:40:34,420
Of course she won't.

385
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:38,530
She's going to start gathering shares immediately, and she will refuse to give you your shares till the end.

386
00:40:38,530 --> 00:40:42,840
So, in the end, Mo Wan Joon will get that Chairman seat.

387
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:45,620
Then let's get rid of Mo Wan Joon first.

388
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:47,970
With the added option of Ha Yeon Seo?

389
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:02,040
 Young Master Mo Wan Soo 

390
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:07,850
Director Han,

391
00:41:07,850 --> 00:41:13,770
these days this humanist is in the midst of a very serious dilemma.

392
00:41:17,410 --> 00:41:20,220
If I'm really a humanist,

393
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:24,990
I shouldn't ignore Lawyer Heo's falsely imprisoned mother, right?

394
00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:26,560
So?

395
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:33,260
But when I think about turning myself in, I worry about Director Han.

396
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:35,470
This is an absolute dilemma.

397
00:41:35,470 --> 00:41:39,560
You can't prove that a crime was hidden without the evidence.

398
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:44,990
So, if I confess, there will be no fallout for you

399
00:41:44,990 --> 00:41:48,650
and I won't have to feel bad.

400
00:41:50,370 --> 00:41:54,200
But you need to become a excellent film director.

401
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:56,560
Why do you think that way?

402
00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:00,810
Don't you wish to leave a work behind that only you can create?

403
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:03,670
You don't have that much time.

404
00:42:06,410 --> 00:42:08,440
But Director Han...

405
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:13,690
you've never had a goal or plan go wrong in your life, right?

406
00:42:15,690 --> 00:42:18,250
It's because I put in the effort.

407
00:42:20,290 --> 00:42:23,280
That's what successful people think.

408
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:28,850
Just because you failed, it's not because you didn't put in the effort.

409
00:42:28,850 --> 00:42:33,000
But a person like you who's never failed

410
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,000
would not know about that.

411
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,870
That's because results speak for themselves.

412
00:42:49,110 --> 00:42:52,410
 MC TOWER 

413
00:42:52,410 --> 00:42:57,150
Is today the start of a new MC?

414
00:42:57,150 --> 00:42:59,490
I've checked over everything regarding the appointment ceremony.

415
00:42:59,490 --> 00:43:03,390
Chairman Mo Wan Joon and Ha Yeong Seo are planning to leave after their meal.

416
00:43:03,390 --> 00:43:05,300
The reporters for the major new outlets have already arrived.

417
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:10,150
Mexico's deputy finance minister has arrived at the airport and we are escorting him here.

418
00:43:10,150 --> 00:43:12,580
There can be no mistakes.

419
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:15,130
Until this is over, everyone please stay alert.

420
00:43:15,130 --> 00:43:17,110
Yes, we understand.

421
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:35,890
Madam is coming in.

422
00:43:38,210 --> 00:43:40,770
The second young master is coming in.

423
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:49,670
The eldest son has entered.

424
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:01,860
- Your fashion today is pretty cool. 
 - Right?

425
00:44:05,690 --> 00:44:08,230
Are you coming to the inauguration ceremony?

426
00:44:08,230 --> 00:44:10,550
Would you like me to come?

427
00:44:10,550 --> 00:44:14,360
Why? Are you worried I'll throw some kind of bomb?

428
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:17,870
You are uncomfortable when you're not in the spotlight.

429
00:44:17,870 --> 00:44:21,810
That's right. It's best if you stay home.

430
00:44:21,810 --> 00:44:26,480
I don't want people talking about the first son and second son.

431
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:31,020
The first transgender CEO...

432
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:34,020
It's quite beautiful.

433
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:39,640
- If you are an artist full of humanity, shouldn't you be welcoming me with picket signs? 
 - That's true.

434
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:43,100
In any case, Mo Wan Joon you're amazing

435
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:45,800
for overcoming adversity and getting the top seat.

436
00:44:46,550 --> 00:44:48,350
This is your inauguration present.

437
00:44:52,060 --> 00:44:54,500
It's not a bomb, bro.

438
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:57,450
I found it, your handkerchief.

439
00:44:59,420 --> 00:45:01,760
I also prepared a gift.

440
00:45:05,190 --> 00:45:06,880
Welcome Lawyer Heo.

441
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:09,960
Why don't you hand out the presents.

442
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:12,650
These are legal complaints

443
00:45:12,650 --> 00:45:14,530
that Seok Hui filed against the two of you.

444
00:45:14,530 --> 00:45:17,440
- What? 
 - Are you kidding right now?

445
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:22,440
Come in.

446
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:34,730
Ha Yeong Seo, you are under arrest

447
00:45:34,730 --> 00:45:37,310
regarding the theft, fraud, and copyright infringement of Ahn Jae Rim's paintings.

448
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:42,460
You have the right to not incriminate yourself, you can hire a lawyer.

449
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:46,830
Anything you say can be used against you in the court of law.

450
00:45:46,830 --> 00:45:50,500
Mo Seok Hui, are you going to destroy your household like this?

451
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:52,680
Do you think I'm going to let it end like this?

452
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:56,040
I can never let it end like this. Who do you think I am!

453
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:58,110
I am Ha Yeong Seo.

454
00:45:58,110 --> 00:46:00,740
Do you think you can kill me?

455
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:03,900
There's no way this will go how you want. Understand?!

456
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:06,000
You terrible bitch.

457
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:09,070
- Let go of me. 
 - Mom.

458
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:17,820
Mister Mo Wan Joon, for charges of offshore tax evasion through a paper company,

459
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:20,630
we are arresting you.

460
00:46:29,050 --> 00:46:32,200
You have the right to a lawyer, and the right to refute the charges,

461
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:34,720
You can exercise the right to appeal the legality of the arrest.

462
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:37,300
You have the right to remain silent.

463
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:48,940
Reporter Kim, do you have the evidence about Mo Wan Joon establishing that paper company.

464
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:51,500
I do.

465
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:53,200
Is it finally the time to pay back TOP for humiliating me

466
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:56,910
by getting MC's Mo Wan Joon?

467
00:47:02,610 --> 00:47:06,380
There is evidence of setting up a paper company in the Virgin Islands, a tax haven.

468
00:47:06,380 --> 00:47:10,040
This is a copy of the  business registration I got from Director Park.

469
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:14,010
And a copy of the deposit of money from the paper company into a Swiss bank account.

470
00:47:14,010 --> 00:47:17,380
English and Korean versions.

471
00:47:18,670 --> 00:47:22,600
It's about 5 billion won in slush funds.

472
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:24,600
-Right.  
 - Great.

473
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:27,050
Nice. Ah, what about Ha Yeong Seo?

474
00:47:27,050 --> 00:47:29,680
The MC Art Gallery stores its art in a warehouse in Paju.

475
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:33,700
Sneak in and take as many pictures as you can of the artwork signed YS.

There's a security guard.  Will you be okay?

477
00:47:36,450 --> 00:47:39,920
Actually, intrusion is my speciality.

478
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:42,200
Somehow I'll get in so don't worry.

Our Jang Mi is not just good at helping out. She is on the national team.

Go to the police station and find out what happened to the Madame.

00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:31,490
Yes.

489
00:50:32,630 --> 00:50:36,170
I'm going to the Prosecutor's office, so cancel the inauguration.

490
00:50:36,170 --> 00:50:38,090
Yes, understood.

491
00:50:58,750 --> 00:51:00,890
Is it my turn now?

492
00:51:08,310 --> 00:51:12,480
Please speak truthfully now.

What do you think I should choose?

Lawyer Heo. I sent something to Prosecutor Joo Tae Hyeong.

496
00:51:48,870 --> 00:51:51,330
Will you go there and check it?

497
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:55,170
It should have arrived by now.

00:52:03,670 --> 00:52:07,700
What is it? Is Aunt Seok Hui going with you?

I hope lawyer Heo will be happy in the future.

 I, Mo Wan Joon killed Ahn Jae Rim. 

502
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:52,620
 That afternoon, with a bottle of wine, 

503
00:52:52,620 --> 00:52:55,390
 and a book   View From The Rear   

504
00:52:56,190 --> 00:52:59,360
 I went to Ahn Jae Rim's villa. 

505
00:53:01,740 --> 00:53:04,690
 If Ahn Jae Rim left, 

506
00:53:05,660 --> 00:53:09,200
 I believed Mom would be happy. 

507
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:12,870
Mo Wan Joon came drunk late  at night.

508
00:53:13,780 --> 00:53:15,920
But why didn't you tell me?

509
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:21,110
Mo Wan Soo said he wanted to tell you two in person

510
00:53:21,110 --> 00:53:26,610
he told me to give him a last  chance to talk to you.

511
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:30,630
It must have been hard.

512
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:41,950
Let Detective Oh arrest Mo Wan Soo.

513
00:53:41,950 --> 00:53:47,820
For now, since we have the solid proof, we should get started.

514
00:53:47,820 --> 00:53:49,950
What about Director Han?

515
00:53:49,950 --> 00:53:55,790
I've requested a search and seizure warrant.  It will be issued soon.

516
00:53:56,680 --> 00:54:00,760
Director Han, I will be seeing you soon.

517
00:54:32,750 --> 00:54:34,520
Mo Wan Soo?

518
00:54:35,550 --> 00:54:36,500
Hi!

519
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:41,960
You are being arrested without warrant in the Housekeeper Murder Case of 15 years ago.

520
00:54:42,870 --> 00:54:45,000
Ok.

521
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:54,160
By the way, the music hasn't ended yet,

522
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:57,520
can we finish the music?

523
00:54:59,610 --> 00:55:02,720
Korea's governmental authority

524
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:07,150
should be upgraded about the suspect's human rights.

525
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:52,550
Wan Soo solved the problems he himself created.

526
00:56:52,550 --> 00:56:54,380
Right.

527
00:57:00,270 --> 00:57:03,350
Yes detective Oh, Are you done arresting?

528
00:57:06,430 --> 00:57:07,950
What?

529
00:57:23,170 --> 00:57:24,770
Lawyer Heo?

530
00:57:28,170 --> 00:57:30,030
What is it?

531
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:33,970
Young Master Wan Soo...

532
00:57:39,910 --> 00:57:41,940
No way...

533
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:05,930
How dare he..

534
00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:11,420
How dare he kill himself.

535
00:58:14,490 --> 00:58:19,250
If he lived 15 years afterwards, he should take the full responsibility.

536
00:58:21,810 --> 00:58:24,120
How dare he kill himself.

537
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:30,370
Til the end, you do what you want ...

538
00:58:32,290 --> 00:58:35,420
Til the end, you do what you want ...

539
00:58:36,260 --> 00:58:39,350
What should I do?

540
00:58:39,350 --> 00:58:41,990
How dare he kill himself!!!

541
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:52,470

546
00:59:47,150 --> 00:59:49,980
It will be issued very soon.

547
00:59:57,960 --> 01:00:01,560
Don't panic and stay in your places.

548
01:00:43,530 --> 01:00:48,960
 Mrs. Han's heart must not be working properly. 

549
01:00:51,900 --> 01:00:54,960
 If your heart were functioning normally, 

550
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:58,300
  you probably would have chosen me. 

551
01:01:00,390 --> 01:01:06,070
Nevertheless, I respect your ability.

552
01:01:08,350 --> 01:01:12,720
I wanted to have but never could get that person.

553
01:01:20,100 --> 01:01:22,820
 Would that be possible in my next life? 

554
01:02:00,860 --> 01:02:05,260
TOP now has entered the unavoidable time.

555
01:02:07,900 --> 01:02:14,100
Bribery, extortion, violation of the Privacy Act, 2 years imprisonment.

556
01:02:17,090 --> 01:02:22,140
Violation of the Privacy Act, Extortion, Coercion, 1 year imprisonment.

557

Violation of the Privacy and Telecommunication Privacy Acts, 1 year 6 months imprisonment.

Illegal surveillance and Information Protection Act violation 1 year imprisonment.

559
01:02:41,510 --> 01:02:46,210
Because you chose TOP, it's a fate you must accept.

560
01:02:48,850 --> 01:02:53,560
Now we need to let go of our MC.

561
01:03:13,580 --> 01:03:15,860
For me, you are

562
01:03:29,900 --> 01:03:35,470
the best co-workers.

563
01:04:17,370 --> 01:04:19,390
We are closing.

564
01:04:44,250 --> 01:04:46,530
You won.

565
01:04:47,830 --> 01:04:51,990
I didn't win, the principle has won.

566
01:04:51,990 --> 01:04:56,080
An impenetrable fortress TOP has ended.

567
01:04:58,820 --> 01:05:01,380
Now it's a new paradigm.

568
01:05:02,190 --> 01:05:05,460
It's a period of responsibility till now

569
01:05:05,460 --> 01:05:10,450
from now on, it's a period of empathy.

570
01:05:19,510 --> 01:05:23,190
Whoever comes first would make the rules.

573
01:06:25,550 --> 01:06:28,550
 It was an amazing thing to confront the world with laws. 

574
01:06:28,550 --> 01:06:32,900
 But in that organization, I had lots of limitations. 

575
01:06:32,900 --> 01:06:35,880
 That's why you chose MC group? 

576
01:06:35,880 --> 01:06:40,470
 Come to MC group, and work without discrimination as a woman. 

577
01:06:40,470 --> 01:06:43,660
 I'll support you fully. 

578
01:06:43,660 --> 01:06:47,080
 Why did Father's will take everything away from me? 

579
01:06:47,080 --> 01:06:51,930
 MC group should not be moved by personal feelings. 

580
01:06:59,500 --> 01:07:03,800
 Lawyer, it's not right.  That's not what you promised. 

581
01:07:03,820 --> 01:07:07,180
 Whoever becomes an obstacle to MC group, there's no exception. 

582
01:07:07,180 --> 01:07:09,790
  Can I not go?  

583
01:07:09,790 --> 01:07:16,730
  Can I just stay with my grandfather, please?  

584
01:07:16,730 --> 01:07:18,730
 To maintain MC group, 

585
01:07:18,730 --> 01:07:21,080
 the obvious thing is that whatever we do 

586
01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:24,100
 is never enough. 

587
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:36,020
 At TOP, you can do whatever you want. 

588
01:07:36,020 --> 01:07:40,360
 For us to protect MC, it's to protect many employees 

589
01:07:40,360 --> 01:07:43,040
 and to protect this country. 

590
01:07:43,040 --> 01:07:47,360
  Try thinking that in my hands, in TOP's hands, 

591
01:07:48,600 --> 01:07:55,100
  that big empire is moving.  Isn't that exciting? 

592
01:08:09,260 --> 01:08:11,220
 You won. 

593
01:08:11,220 --> 01:08:15,360
 The TOP of Han Je Gook, who defended the impregnable fortress, is finished.

 Right, no one can imitate you 

597
01:08:50,240 --> 01:08:54,260
 and no matter who it is, no one can replace you. 

598
01:08:56,330 --> 01:09:00,820
  Mo Wan Soo, be well.  

599
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:08,800
 Ask for forgiveness from Mom in there. 

600
01:09:10,570 --> 01:09:13,970
  I am Mo Wan Soo. 
 1983.05.11 ~ 2019.10.24 

601
01:09:53,890 --> 01:09:59,030
He deliberately dressed up going on this last trip.

602
01:09:59,030 --> 01:10:03,090
On the day he came to see me, he confessed to prosecutor Joo.

603
01:10:03,090 --> 01:10:05,900
He was ready to leave.

604
01:10:07,770 --> 01:10:10,160
That's so like Mo Wan Soo.

605
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:20,790
Wait a moment.

606
01:10:23,930 --> 01:10:25,910
Prosecutor Joo.

607
01:10:27,170 --> 01:10:30,760
What? Director Han?

608
01:10:35,570 --> 01:10:38,700
Director Han disappeared?  What do you mean now?

609
01:10:38,700 --> 01:10:40,600
I took the warrant but she had disappeared.

610
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:44,000
- What about a travel ban? 
 - Of course there is one. She can't leave the country.

611
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:48,490
It's a matter of time because she is wanted now.

612
01:10:48,490 --> 01:10:53,270
However there is a problem.  The wine glasses, book, and the weapon of the crime.  Every item of evidence is gone.

613
01:10:53,270 --> 01:10:56,090
- What?  
 - Han Jae Gook's office and house

614
01:10:56,090 --> 01:10:59,490
and also the  MC building were all searched.

615
01:10:59,490 --> 01:11:01,410
They haven't turned up.

616
01:11:01,410 --> 01:11:06,100
It's impossible to have her sentenced to prison based only on the video of  Mo Wan Soo's confession.

617
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,700
Not to mention the request for retrial.

618
01:11:46,620 --> 01:11:50,040
Your expressions indiate you were imagining something, right?

619
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:58,880
What did he decide?  That's his life.

620
01:11:59,960 --> 01:12:03,160
Life is a constant succession of choices.

621
01:12:03,160 --> 01:12:06,350
Whether they are wrong or right.

622
01:12:07,450 --> 01:12:10,250
And you have to be responsible for your choice.

623
01:12:10,250 --> 01:12:14,620
It's not my modus operandi  to avoid responsibility.

624
01:12:40,060 --> 01:12:42,590
You have a variety of charges.

625
01:12:45,980 --> 01:12:51,960
Conspiracy to murder Chairman Mo Wang Pyo? That will be difficult to prove.

626
01:12:54,100 --> 01:12:59,100
Interruption of official business? Not guilty.  Conspiracy to commit fraud.

627
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:03,640
Can you really get a sentence of imprionsment?

628
01:13:08,290 --> 01:13:10,970
That's up to the judge.

629
01:13:17,780 --> 01:13:19,620
 Court in session 

630
01:13:19,620 --> 01:13:24,400
Mo Wan Soo has confessed to being the culprit in the 2004 Housekeeper case but

631
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:29,830
unfortunately he committed suicide and the right of arraignment has disappeared.

632
01:13:30,580 --> 01:13:33,270
For 15 years, an innocent person has been imprisoned.

633
01:13:33,270 --> 01:13:38,390
A real culprit in the case is Han Je Guk

634
01:13:38,390 --> 01:13:43,220
who destroyed evidence and covered the crime.

635
01:13:44,700 --> 01:13:49,630
The prosecution is making the defendant a criminal through speculation.

636
01:13:50,910 --> 01:13:53,610
Is that so?

637
01:13:53,610 --> 01:13:55,950
I'm requesting a witness to take the stand.

638
01:13:56,610 --> 01:14:01,270
In 2004, you were  the detective in charge of the investigation of the Housekeeper Murder Case.

639
01:14:01,270 --> 01:14:06,220
It turns out there was an inadequate investigation and omission of evidence.  How did that happen?

640
01:14:06,220 --> 01:14:14,370
I witnessed Director Han Je Gook give a large sum of money to Park Jin Soo who was the chief then.

641
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:20,760
Did you receive money too?

642
01:14:21,550 --> 01:14:23,360
Yes.

643
01:14:33,610 --> 01:14:38,920
These are items of evidence which were found at the scene of the 2004 murder.

644
01:14:38,920 --> 01:14:42,500
The Defendant hid the evidence for 15 years.

645
01:14:42,500 --> 01:14:46,750
If the Defendant had not hidden the evidence and had turned herself in,

646
01:14:46,750 --> 01:14:49,410
after paying a reasonable price,

647
01:14:49,410 --> 01:14:52,500
she would be living a new life today.

648
01:14:52,500 --> 01:14:56,160
Of course, no one would have been falsely accused.

649
01:15:02,590 --> 01:15:04,490
I'm submitting the evidence.

650
01:15:04,490 --> 01:15:07,800
Your Honors, there is also evidence that the Defendant

651
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:12,490
attempted to kill the chairman she served.

652
01:15:13,320 --> 01:15:18,630
Before the death of Chairman Mo Wang Pyo, what did the Defendant ask you?

653
01:15:18,630 --> 01:15:24,990
At the time, Director Han persistently asked me the condition of the chairman.

654
01:15:24,990 --> 01:15:28,640
As a physician, aren't you prohibited from divulging the patient's condition?

655
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:32,420
I felt that I shouldn't answer.

656
01:15:32,420 --> 01:15:35,020
Did you feel threatened?

657
01:15:38,260 --> 01:15:43,720
So, did you tell the Defendant which foods were dangerous to the Chairman?

658
01:15:43,720 --> 01:15:46,210
I told her what he should never be given.

659
01:15:46,210 --> 01:15:50,190
Given that,  if she intentionally offered food dangerous for him to consume and had him eat the food,

660
01:15:50,190 --> 01:15:55,480
can we consider that as an intent to kill?

661
01:15:57,910 --> 01:15:59,820
Yes.

662
01:15:59,820 --> 01:16:01,530
Next witness.

663
01:16:01,530 --> 01:16:03,910
Did the Defendant tell you to order the cook to prepare food

664
01:16:03,910 --> 01:16:07,230
for the chairman with bitter almonds which was dangerous to him?

665
01:16:07,300 --> 01:16:11,300
- I didn't order it.  
 - Who did?

666
01:16:31,580 --> 01:16:35,190
While using  the halo of ominipotence of the huge conglomerate known as MC Group as her personal privilege

667
01:16:35,190 --> 01:16:39,590
the Defendant Han Je Guk committed a variety of crimes.

668
01:16:39,590 --> 01:16:42,300
To ensure that these crimes won't be repeated,

669
01:16:42,300 --> 01:16:45,860
in our request for  the court to  grant stern punishment,

670
01:16:45,860 --> 01:16:49,030
the prosecution seeks for Han Je Gook,

671
01:16:49,030 --> 01:16:51,720
five years for destruction of evidence in the Housekeeper Murder Case.

672
01:16:51,720 --> 01:16:54,430
three years for obstruction of justice,

673
01:16:54,430 --> 01:16:56,930
five years for conspiracy to murder Chairman My Wang Pyo,

674
01:16:56,930 --> 01:17:01,180
and two years for fraud.

675
01:17:01,180 --> 01:17:05,170
Defendant, you may make the defense's final argument.

676
01:17:06,230 --> 01:17:08,400
I acknowledge all accusations.

677
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:13,390
Therefore, I waive final argument.

678
01:17:22,820 --> 01:17:24,640
This is the judgment.

679
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:30,920
The charge against Han Je Gook for committing acts in a conspiracy to kill Chairman Mo Wang Pyo

680
01:17:30,920 --> 01:17:35,050
is dismissed for insufficient evidence.

681
01:17:35,050 --> 01:17:38,720
Then,  the charges of obstruction of justice, false accusation,

682
01:17:38,720 --> 01:17:44,970
fraud, and four counts of destruction of evidence, were established.

683
01:17:44,970 --> 01:17:49,350
Although the Defendant admitted her crimes,

684
01:17:49,350 --> 01:17:53,530
she must pay fines of 10 million won for obstruction of justice, 15 million won for false accusation,

685
01:17:53,530 --> 01:17:57,210
and 10 million won for fraud.

686
01:17:57,210 --> 01:18:01,350
Further, for the crimes of concealment and destruction of evidence

687
01:18:01,350 --> 01:18:06,120
for which an innocent person was unjustly imprisoned for 15 years,

688
01:18:06,200 --> 01:18:10,270
this court sentences the Defendant Han Je Gook

689
01:18:10,270 --> 01:18:14,700
to serve 4 years in prison.

690
01:18:35,030 --> 01:18:37,870
 There is no evidence for the murder 15 years ago. 

691
01:18:37,870 --> 01:18:42,360
 It would be hard to bring charges on the basis of Mo Wan Soo''s confession. In addition, he's dead. 

692
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:46,590
 Han Je Gook, you aren't the Director Han of the past. 

693
01:18:46,590 --> 01:18:49,200
 Do you still not understand the situation? 

694
01:18:49,250 --> 01:18:52,590
 I am talking because I do understand the situation. 

695
01:18:53,690 --> 01:18:56,240
 You want to put me in prison. 

696
01:18:57,410 --> 01:18:59,690
 There is a way. 

697
01:19:00,650 --> 01:19:03,270
 You can't put a scratch on MC. 

698
01:19:03,270 --> 01:19:09,020
 Treat it as the personal crime of mine, Han Je Guk, which has nothing to do with MC Group. 

699
01:19:14,180 --> 01:19:18,420
 Are you going to go with it or not? 

700
01:19:21,060 --> 01:19:24,420
 The only charge which will put you in prison is concealment of murder. 

701
01:19:24,420 --> 01:19:28,020
 But, the evidence has disappeared. 

702
01:19:28,020 --> 01:19:31,550
 So why would I be betting on your deal? 

703
01:19:31,550 --> 01:19:34,160
What if I bring you the evidence?

704
01:19:36,700 --> 01:19:42,700
 I am the sole offender and MC Group has nothing to do with it. 

705
01:19:42,700 --> 01:19:44,200
Okay?

706
01:20:51,790 --> 01:20:57,020
 Father.  Never mind the world's opinion. 

707
01:20:57,910 --> 01:21:02,640
 You were a good father to me and a good prosecutor. 

708
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:07,670
 Tae Hyeong. 

709
01:21:10,930 --> 01:21:15,650
 I was both never a good father nor a good prosecutor. 

710
01:21:15,650 --> 01:21:17,690
  Father.  

711
01:21:23,610 --> 01:21:29,010
  You are the real prosecutor! 

712
01:22:08,450 --> 01:22:12,610
Heo Yoon Do. Registered mail from the court.

713
01:22:16,150 --> 01:22:19,000
 Seoul Central District Court To Heo Yoon Do. 

714
01:22:38,430 --> 01:22:42,640
 Order Re:  Request for Retrial 

715
01:22:48,190 --> 01:22:52,460
Son,  it didn't work out again?

716
01:22:52,460 --> 01:22:55,100
 The Petitioner's Request for Retrial is Granted. 

717
01:22:55,100 --> 01:22:56,890
The retrial

718
01:22:58,860 --> 01:23:00,750
was approved.

719
01:23:03,400 --> 01:23:08,000
Son! Congratulations!

720
01:23:09,160 --> 01:23:12,270
Son, congratulations!

721
01:23:18,060 --> 01:23:21,660
Defendant, make your closing statement.

722
01:23:21,660 --> 01:23:24,410
 Defense Attorney ~ Defendant 

723
01:23:38,620 --> 01:23:43,790
Your Honors.  There was a boy.

724
01:23:43,790 --> 01:23:51,120
Although he both didn't study well and he wasn't rich, he had a dream.

725
01:23:53,210 --> 01:23:55,740
And a mother who was raising her son by herself.

726
01:23:55,740 --> 01:23:58,940
Feeding him three warm meals each day

727
01:23:58,940 --> 01:24:01,830
and when it was night, covering him with a warm blanket.

728
01:24:01,830 --> 01:24:07,830
It was a simple dream to share one chicken with his mother on her payday.

729
01:24:07,830 --> 01:24:13,280
But one day, suddenly, that simple dream was shattered.

730
01:24:13,280 --> 01:24:19,620
A mother who became a murderer because she was uneducated, poor, and had no backing.

731
01:24:19,620 --> 01:24:25,360
How did the boy who lost his mother, his sole support, live?

732
01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:30,690
Instead of resenting, despising and hating someone,

733
01:24:30,690 --> 01:24:34,300
studied dilgently and whole-heartedly.

734
01:24:34,300 --> 01:24:38,520
Because he believed there surely was a way to correct a wrong

735
01:24:38,520 --> 01:24:43,280
if you appealed to a warm conscience rather than feeling hate.

736
01:24:44,170 --> 01:24:46,120
Your Honors.

737
01:24:46,200 --> 01:24:51,300
I stand beside the South Korea's police, prosecution, and judiciary ...

738
01:24:51,300 --> 01:24:57,000
But they also stole the life of an innocent woman for 15 years in the name of the law.

739
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,200
Acknowledge the legal system's mistake

740
01:24:59,200 --> 01:25:03,800
which trampled on the lives of a powerless woman and boy with a simple dream

741
01:25:03,830 --> 01:25:09,080
and please give them back the lives they lost now.

742
01:25:13,280 --> 01:25:15,590
I will announce our judgment.

743
01:25:15,590 --> 01:25:21,760
The Defendant Im Soon's confession was made because of coercion by the investigators.

744
01:25:21,760 --> 01:25:26,410
The real culprit has been identified and Defendant has been proven innocent.

745
01:25:26,500 --> 01:25:37,000
This court finds Defendant Im Soon innocent, innocent, innocent!

746
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:26,200
Thank you. My wonderful son.

747
01:26:53,060 --> 01:26:56,800
What do you think? How do you feel after hearing MC's history?

748
01:26:56,800 --> 01:27:00,690
So what role will TOP play in the future?

749
01:27:00,690 --> 01:27:06,210
TOP is now in an age where feeling empathy is needed more than feeling responsibility.

750
01:27:06,210 --> 01:27:10,950
Starting now, we're going to create rules which everyone can identify with.

751
01:27:10,950 --> 01:27:15,760
Everyone comes first.

752
01:27:20,190 --> 01:27:22,290
Hello!

753
01:27:27,510 --> 01:27:31,760
What is it?  Why so serious?

754
01:27:31,760 --> 01:27:35,370
New TOP will be far away from the illegal stuffs.

755
01:27:35,370 --> 01:27:38,370
There is no need to be nervous.

756
01:27:38,370 --> 01:27:39,650
Get out and do your job.

757
01:27:39,650 --> 01:27:41,370
Yes.

758
01:27:52,290 --> 01:27:57,570
Lawyer Heo. Should we have a party today?

759
01:27:57,600 --> 01:28:00,700
- A party? 
 - Yes.

760
01:28:13,200 --> 01:28:16,940
Thank you for accepting my invitation and coming.

761
01:28:23,260 --> 01:28:25,600
Congrats on the award.

762
01:28:26,430 --> 01:28:29,080
I'm getting more awards but the house is so small that I have no place to put them.

763
01:28:29,080 --> 01:28:32,890
I should donate them here since your house is big.

764
01:28:34,180 --> 01:28:37,310
Congrats for the promotion.

765
01:28:37,310 --> 01:28:41,400
Do I look great?

766
01:28:41,400 --> 01:28:43,040
Nice uniform, detective!

767
01:28:43,040 --> 01:28:45,880
Nice rhyme, detective Oh.

768
01:28:45,880 --> 01:28:48,150
Thank you.

769
01:28:48,150 --> 01:28:50,240
Thank you Miss.

770
01:28:50,240 --> 01:28:53,830
I don't know how long it's been we had our meal together.

771
01:28:53,830 --> 01:28:58,360
Right, it's been a while eating together.

772
01:29:00,410 --> 01:29:03,840
You all took the risks

773
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:08,990
and were on the side of justice and conscience, that's why we are here now.

774
01:29:08,990 --> 01:29:11,120
Thank you.

775
01:29:13,290 --> 01:29:18,150
By the way, I did nothing and I'm here to eat.

776
01:29:18,150 --> 01:29:21,410
No, that's non-sense. Water slap!

777
01:29:21,410 --> 01:29:25,400
Mrs. Han probably never experienced that before.

778
01:29:25,400 --> 01:29:29,010
Water slap incident, right.

779
01:29:29,010 --> 01:29:32,460
Dad. you were the spiritual leader of our One Team.

780
01:29:32,460 --> 01:29:34,200
Of course.

781
01:29:34,200 --> 01:29:35,950
Was I?

782
01:29:42,530 --> 01:29:45,690
It's a wonderful evening.

783
01:29:45,690 --> 01:29:51,350
Noona. No. Aunt.

784
01:29:52,560 --> 01:29:56,670
Welcome! Home sweet home!

785
01:30:02,040 --> 01:30:03,750
Nani nani boo boo!

786
01:30:03,750 --> 01:30:06,940
Hello, nice to meet you.

787
01:30:09,080 --> 01:30:13,660
But don't tell me.  Is this a party celebrating Choi Na Ri's return?

788
01:30:13,660 --> 01:30:18,520
But. well, could it be ...  return as a queen?

789
01:30:19,700 --> 01:30:26,600
No, no, no. ... It's the housekeeper role.

790
01:30:26,600 --> 01:30:31,570
It's a really important role in a murder case.

791
01:30:31,570 --> 01:30:34,440
Please look forward to it.

792
01:30:35,340 --> 01:30:40,040
Alright, let's all toast.

793
01:30:40,040 --> 01:30:42,920
Shall I do one of the unique toasts?

794
01:30:42,920 --> 01:30:47,080
When I say MC, everyone please say Picasso.

795
01:30:48,200 --> 01:30:51,600
- Should I do it or not? 
 - Do it. Do it.

796
01:30:51,640 --> 01:30:54,360
- MC! 
 - Picasso! ( Korean bikyeosso for "Got out of the way") 

797
01:30:54,360 --> 01:30:59,860
♫  I am on fire. I am on fire.  ♫

798
01:31:04,330 --> 01:31:09,870
♫  You are liar. You are liar.  ♫

799
01:32:18,780 --> 01:32:25,440
 When I was young. ... When will Dad come home? 

800
01:32:25,440 --> 01:32:28,490
 When Dad comes, shall I ask him to take me to the baseball stadium? 

801
01:32:28,490 --> 01:32:31,260
 Shall we go to an amusement park? 

802
01:32:31,260 --> 01:32:34,810
 The anticipation always made me excited. 

803
01:32:34,810 --> 01:32:40,760
 But you were busy and my expectations always crumbled. 

804
01:32:40,760 --> 01:32:46,520
 Even so, at the time, to me you were a cherished dad. 

805
01:32:47,290 --> 01:32:52,510
 After I went to America, I hated and despised you. 

806
01:32:52,510 --> 01:32:55,520
 Because I thought you abandoned  me, 

807
01:32:57,360 --> 01:33:00,390
 I can't forgive you. 

808
01:33:00,390 --> 01:33:05,940
 Because you haven't given me an opportunity to forgive you. 

809
01:33:08,080 --> 01:33:10,840
  Be well, Father. 

810
01:33:10,840 --> 01:33:19,430
 Even so, you have been my father for 30 years. 

811
01:33:26,650 --> 01:33:30,710
 Your younger sister Seok Hui is leaving for America now. 

812
01:33:31,460 --> 01:33:34,790
 It is my own choice now. 

813
01:33:48,990 --> 01:33:50,480
 Please take care of him. 

814
01:33:50,480 --> 01:33:53,430
Don't worry, Miss.

815
01:33:53,430 --> 01:33:59,220
Your family has also become my family.

816
01:34:29,180 --> 01:34:35,000
 It's a gift from Oppa Wan Soo.  Do you want to open it? 

817
01:34:37,200 --> 01:34:40,180
 I found it. Your handkerchief. 

818
01:35:42,440 --> 01:35:47,200
 Oppa Wan Soo left this for you. 

819
01:35:54,870 --> 01:35:57,590
 Mom 

820
01:36:14,700 --> 01:36:20,700
Wan Soo.  Wan Soo.

821
01:36:24,110 --> 01:36:28,070
 I adore my mother the most in the world. 

822
01:36:28,070 --> 01:36:33,040
  Be well, Mother.  

823
01:36:33,040 --> 01:36:37,150
Wan Soo, my child.

824
01:36:38,110 --> 01:36:40,720
My child.

825
01:36:42,300 --> 01:36:44,870
Mother is sorry.

826
01:36:44,870 --> 01:36:47,890
I am so sorry.

827
01:37:00,660 --> 01:37:04,050
  A few years later  

828
01:37:04,050 --> 01:37:08,410
Happy birthday!

829
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:15,510
- Chief, didn't you bring anything else? 
 - No.

830
01:37:15,510 --> 01:37:17,570
There isn't.  I came intentionally because I respect your taste.

831
01:37:17,600 --> 01:37:22,300
I deliberately came here because I respect your taste.  Here, big size.

832
01:37:24,770 --> 01:37:27,960
Anyway, I have a big size mania.

833
01:37:27,960 --> 01:37:32,800
For me, big shoes, big bags, and big pay too. Big fries.  I love it.

834
01:37:32,800 --> 01:37:35,280
What's the next item?

835
01:37:35,280 --> 01:37:39,720
How about this?  The A University President's daughter-in-law asked for a job.

836
01:37:39,720 --> 01:37:41,560
Other reporters grabbed the eggs (the substance) of the story.

837
01:37:41,560 --> 01:37:44,960
You were a coward so you didn't even pick up the shells.

838
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:48,700
It's really my birthday and you're nagging me like an old fart. I can't talk to you.

839
01:37:48,700 --> 01:37:52,480
Old fart?  Jang Mi, have you ever been hit with a giant squid?

840
01:37:52,500 --> 01:37:56,070
- Have you ever been stabbed with a rice cake fork? 
 - Has your nostril ever been pierced with a fish cake skewer?

841
01:37:56,070 --> 01:37:59,060
Have you ever had a blood sausage burst while you were eating it?

842
01:37:59,100 --> 01:38:02,800
- I left my cell phone.  It has my credit card on it. 
 - You have to pay.

843
01:38:02,800 --> 01:38:06,660
You must be crazy! You called me here.

844
01:38:06,660 --> 01:38:09,590
Did I have to meet you now in the middle of the night?

845
01:38:09,590 --> 01:38:12,400
What are you doing now?

846
01:38:14,920 --> 01:38:18,880
Happy Birthday.  I put in enough.

847
01:38:20,880 --> 01:38:24,570
I didn't have any envelopes so I put it in a wedding gift bag. Understand.

848
01:38:27,700 --> 01:38:29,590
It's going to be hard to count.  There are too many.

849
01:38:29,600 --> 01:38:33,400
- The paper is very thin. 
 - I put a check in there.

850
01:38:35,120 --> 01:38:37,020
Happy Birthday.

851
01:38:39,320 --> 01:38:42,410
Once again, she's done it.

852
01:38:43,980 --> 01:38:47,080
 Detective Team 1 

853
01:38:48,470 --> 01:38:51,200
You called for a lawyer, right?

854
01:38:58,070 --> 01:38:59,990
Surprise!

855
01:38:59,990 --> 01:39:01,890
Mo Seok Hui.

856
01:39:01,890 --> 01:39:06,360
She got into an argument driving to the airport. Again.

857
01:39:07,620 --> 01:39:09,700
Hey, you really...

858
01:39:09,700 --> 01:39:14,930
TOP, of course, and various lawyers all refused.  And you said you were a defense attorney.

859
01:39:14,930 --> 01:39:18,550
Anyway,  miserable ...

860
01:39:24,540 --> 01:39:29,360
I went to law school in the US but I didn't get licensed.

861
01:39:30,450 --> 01:39:32,290
I don't think I'm cut out for the law.

862
01:39:32,290 --> 01:39:35,420
So what will you do in the future?

863
01:39:35,420 --> 01:39:38,450
You know MC Group always shows a net profit.

864
01:39:38,450 --> 01:39:42,090
Yes, it's doing great.

865
01:39:42,090 --> 01:39:46,180
I have a professional manager running it.

866
01:39:46,180 --> 01:39:49,410
Thanks to that I have made a lot of money.

867
01:39:49,410 --> 01:39:51,860
Really

868
01:39:51,860 --> 01:39:55,440
I going to invest in you.

869
01:39:55,440 --> 01:39:57,440
What did you say?

870
01:39:58,780 --> 01:40:01,490
It's not an investment, it's a proposal.

871
01:40:03,720 --> 01:40:07,990
How about Heo Yoon Do Law Firm?

872
01:40:07,990 --> 01:40:10,760
But there's a condition.

873
01:40:10,760 --> 01:40:15,500
- What is it? 
 - The office is mine.

874
01:40:16,800 --> 01:40:21,080
Our One Team is still valid, right?

875
01:40:22,630 --> 01:40:24,270
Deal.

876
01:40:25,760 --> 01:40:33,020

  Graceful Family  

889
01:41:56,170 --> 01:41:58,500
 We decided to go

891
