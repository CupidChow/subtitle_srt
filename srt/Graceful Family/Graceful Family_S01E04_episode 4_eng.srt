00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:34,710
I’m going to leave MC Group to Seok Hui.

7
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:38,840
Please help her so that she can lead the group well.

8
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:42,490
Chairman, she’s still too young.

9
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:45,110
How about making a decision after watching her a bit longer?

10
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:48,970
She’s very bright and bold.

11
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:51,650
It’s my judgment that she lacks nothing as the one to lead this group.

12
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:55,090
MC Group is at a point which needs stability rather than change.

13
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:57,230
Please consider it.

14
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,110
I’ve already decided.

15
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:07,170
It’s my will drawn up by Lawyer Yoon stating that I am giving all my shares to her.

16
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:10,590
Read it through and make sure there’s nothing lacking.

17
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:12,770
That’s your job.

19
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:50,930
Is Lawyer Han trustworthy?

20
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:53,860
I don’t put all the eggs in one basket.

21
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:56,790
She is not the only one I have.

22
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:58,360
Let’s go to the vacation home today.

23
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,720
Yes, sir.

24
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,480
 Chairman Wang was probably being very careful, 

25
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:14,510
 but mixed among the eggs in the basket, there was one that was bad. 

26
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:36,200
What’s the reason you gave my father’s will to me?

27
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:40,900
MC group should not be affected by trivial emotions.

28
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:48,390
Thankfully, we think the same.

29
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:53,760
I was told the driver has been drinking. Was the accident coincidental?

30
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,370
Think whichever way makes you comfortable.

31
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:05,810
From now on also, more than me,

32
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:08,930
I hope you will continue to love MC group more than me.

33
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:21,600
Which floor would you like to be on?

34
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,600
I will use the same floor as you.

Hey, hey, the car in front of you! In front!

45
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:22,390
I guess you decided to live as a good person.

46
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:26,450
Give me another key.

47
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:30,870
- Thank you. 
 - Have a good time.

48
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,330
It’s not like that.

49
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:53,800
- Get me some underwear to change into.
 - What?

50
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,940
- Hurry up.
 - The doors are closing.

51
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:07,300
So how long have you been seeing one another?

52
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,570
How long has it been? It’s been about a month.

53
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:11,420
Is she pretty? How is her body?

54
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:16,260
Well, she is, but she has a bad temper. But why do you ask all of a sudden?

55
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:20,430
I have to know your girlfriend’s style in order to help you.

56
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:24,550
I’m not the kind of person who sells underwear carelessly.

57
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:27,920
I’m a pro who has been selling underwear for 20 years

58
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:31,410
It’s not that type of a relationship. Just give me anything.

59
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,060
You know the sort of thing that people with bad temper like to wear? Give me that.

60
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:40,010
So she’s a bad girl style  I see.

61
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:43,430
Then...

62
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:45,370
This. It’s killer, isn’t it?

63
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:48,410
You are indeed a pro of 20 years.

64
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:36,960
Exactly how long have you not washed for?

65
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,110
Since the day I got arrested.

66
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:40,860
You could’ve used the communal shower.

67
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:45,380
I can’t shower with other people. On top of that it was cold water.  I rather not do it at all.

68
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:49,570
So instead you decided to offend other people by giving off a bad odor?

69
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:54,260
I have some experience living in a detention center,

70
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:57,900
and those who haven’t gone should just shut their mouth.

71
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:00,460
You always have the last word. Seriously

72
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,660
Seeing that I was released with no charge,

73
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:08,460
it means there was indisputable proof that even Prosecutor Joo couldn’t do anything about.

74
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:11,810
- How did you find it? 
 - No comment.

75
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:15,000
  Director Han calling  

76
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,360
- Yes, Director.
 - Come to the office straight away.

77
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,850
Yes.

78
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,430
Director Han Must be really upset that things didn’t go according to plan.

79
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:28,930
And I could lose my job...

80
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:33,150
Since you got me out when I should’ve been locked up in the detention center,

81
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:36,920
Top probably will fire you.

82
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:40,070
I am sorry.

83
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:43,620
You know how to say those kinds of things too?

84
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:49,250
Drop me off at the hospital.

85
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,960
Okay.

86
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,710
Heo Yoon Do, you’re fired!

87
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:07,860
Do you have something to say?

88
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:10,040
I can’t accept it.

89
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:13,760
Really? Why is that?

90
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,350
Even if it wasn’t Mo Seok Hui,

91
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:20,360
whoever it is, it is my conviction as a lawyer that an innocent person shouldn't go to jail.

92
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:23,470
And I acted accordingly to that conviction.

93
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:25,250
Really?

94
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,820
Why did you become a lawyer?

95
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,520
Pardon?

96
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:42,210
Oh... a while ago, my father got taken by a landlord,

97
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:45,990
and he got chased out and lost his security deposit, too. I felt so much injustice.

98
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:48,920
So in order to stand up against injustice?

99
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,350
- You're an idealist.
 - Pardon?

100
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:54,110
We nearly became homeless.

101
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:58,220
After that time, I dreamed of becoming a lawyer so that I would be able to live a good life without being swindled,

102
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:00,660
so I'm not an idealist.

103
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:05,740
True. The universe doesn't allow an idealistic lawyer.

104
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:10,030
There are three ways a lawyer can resolve a problem.

105
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:13,750
There is a good method, a bad method and the TOP method.

106
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:16,750
Are you a lawyer or TOP's employee?

107
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,310
I am a TOP lawyer.

108
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:21,380
Then follow the rules of TOP.

109
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:24,080
It was TOP's decision to keep Miss in detention.

110
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:29,300
Before I'm TOP's employee, I didn't want to get fired as Mo Seok Hui's employee.

111
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:31,280
Since I'm not an idealist.

112
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,940
Do I cater to Mo Seok Hui or TOP...

113
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:35,630
my position is a little vague, too.

114
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:36,930
You're right.

115
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:39,930
Correct. You did well in getting Miss out.

116
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:42,540
Let's forget about firing you.

117
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:47,970
Your vague position will become clear in time.

118
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:52,930
Until you get special orders, take good care of Miss as you've been doing.

119
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,440
Go to work then.

120
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,060
Yes.

121
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,500
This is an exception, isn't it?

122
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,510
It could affect our plans since Miss got out.

123
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:18,550
Something like this could happen again if you don't take control from the getgo.

124
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:21,030
Lawyer Heo proved her innocence.

125
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:24,620
Thanks to that, we obtained Prosecutor Joo's weakness.

126
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:29,360
Whoever it is, if they have the ability, TOP is open to them, no?

127
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:46,920
MIss, don't go out anymore.  You don't know what could happen again.

128
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,200
Don't worry too much. I came back like this.

129
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:58,420
But is there no change to Grandpa?

130
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:02,700
His color has come back in the last few days.

131
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:06,820
Housekeeper Jeong, excuse us for a second.

132
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,340
Yes.

133
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:19,440
  Lawyer Heo  

134
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,740
What happened?

135
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:31,400
That's good. Then I'm hanging up.

136
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:37,140
What was it about that you're...

137
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:38,980
Nothing.

138
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:45,690
Miss, the land would be difficult to sell off right away,

139
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:50,340
so I'm looking into the Madam in Samcheongdong who's in the loan business for money.

140
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:52,720
But she's so particular that...

141
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,230
- I'll go meet with her. 
 - You will?

142
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:58,230
Yes. If needed, I'll meet with whomever.

143
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:01,290
Then I'll make an appointment as soon as possible.

144
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:02,760
Yes.

145
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:06,770
What will you do about the Minister of Land?

146
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,950
I'm going to get him fall.

147
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:11,230
Is that so?

148
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:15,100
We need some time for the minister to be replaced and for the green belt designation,

149
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:19,350
but we've already spread rumors in the real estate market about the green belt designation.

150
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:22,600
so it will be hard for the other side to sell off their land.

151
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:26,070
We're also in the process of purchasing MC Distribution shares on two tracks.

152
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:28,470
Understood.

153
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:31,210
Madam is coming in.

154
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:34,590
Director Han, are you dating these days?

155
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:37,880
Exactly why did someone get Seok Hui out?

156
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:40,740
You're saying, Seok Hui came out?

157
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:43,530
I was about to brief you on that.

158
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:45,720
Where did you hear that?

159
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:50,010
What do you mean where? According to Housekeeper Jeong, she's at the hospital.

160
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:52,280
How did that happen?

161
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:55,150
Wasn't she going to stay in longer?

162
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:59,350
Her lawyer proved her innocence.

163
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:01,200
TOP is your empire.

164
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:05,130
But without your permission, that newbie took the initiative?

165
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:09,460
It makes no sense and leaves me speechless.

166
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:11,060
Does that even make sense right now?

167
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:12,950
Fire that newbie right away!

168
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:15,650
- TOP's personnel matters has nothing to do with you.
 - What?!

169
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:18,540
Whether TOP's employee is fired or not is up to me to decide.

170
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:20,610
She's right.

171
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:23,850
- Shut your mouth on TOP's personnel matters! 
 - Honey!

172
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:26,050
You!

173
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:29,390
Don't you dare touch a hair on Seok Hui,

174
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:31,900
she's my daughter first and foremost!

175
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:36,220
Leave Seok Hui up to TOP.

176
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:08,030
What is this?

177
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:11,190
Didn't I tell you not to carry personal phones in the house?

178
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:12,730
Do you want to get fired?!

179
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:17,260
I'm sorry. I am expecting an urgent call from home.

180
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:20,820
Were you thinking about recording video and audio and handing it over to the media?

181
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:23,600
How dare you?!

182
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,070
Go to your work.

183
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:47,740
Why do you insist on pulling out the weeds in the garden yourself?

184
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:50,500
When we'll take care of all of them for you.

185
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:04,710
Arrogant wench...

186
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:12,640
I promised to hand you the close news coverage of  Mo Seok Hui, including the sad news.

187
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,580
We're living in a time where promises are broken like flipping your palm back and forth

188
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:17,680
but I'm not that untrustworthy.

189
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,430
Don't talk about it anymore.

190
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:24,010
Seriously, I'm about to get mad, so I'm going to hang up. Bye.

191
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:30,090
Look at this kid, Oh Gwang Mi...

192
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:34,050
It's not jjajangmyeon today. What happened?

193
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:35,620
Please eat.

194
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:40,270
Oh, cool! I guess you're in a good mood today.

195
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:42,890
You're amazing.

196
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:45,530
How did Mo Seok Hui get released?

197
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:48,320
Well, it's the famous MC Group, so I'm sure they took care of it well.

198
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,390
You've become a real reporter now.

199
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:53,580
Figuring out how to keep a copy without the chief knowing.

200
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:56,610
Oh, it's really tasty. Totally crispy.

201
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:59,630
Is it because it's the Royal gift from you?

202
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,260
What are you doing? Dipping it in is the best way.

203
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:07,000
Seriously, this kid...

204
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,750
You pour it on when you eat sweet and sour pork. Don't try to control this, too!

205
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,050
Seriously, it's dipping.

206
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:13,800
There's a history and tradition to eating, too.  Custom and convention, too!

207
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,900
You're supposed to eat this by pouring the sauce on top! Don't try to act up!

208
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:19,250
Are you an ageist? It's dip and eat!

209
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:21,030
What? An ageist?

210
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:25,160
Fine then, let's not do either one.

211
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,980
Let's just drink it.

212
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:30,530
Eat and drink.

213
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:37,170
- It's good. 
 - Really?

214
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:38,500
Try it.

215
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,270
Drink.

216
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:48,410
Wait, should I try drinking then eating?

217
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,620
Oh, good.

218
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:05,750
You're quite capable.

219
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:08,640
Can you read the script while drinking?

220
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,050
Hey! I heard you were locked up  in jail. When did you get out?

221
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:14,850
Today.

222
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:19,190
Oh... I was going to come visit you. You came out too fast.

223
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:21,700
You were... really going to come see me?

224
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:26,250
Of course. I was going to come by with the Korean beef you love.

225
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:29,130
- You're not allowed food from outside. 
 - Yeah?

226
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:34,840
Weird. My friend from Choopoong Construction got locked up, too, and

227
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:37,260
he said he had barbecued sirloin.

228
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:40,630
No way. You're high-profile. Why couldn't you?

229
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:45,480
I guess I'm not special enough of a high-profile person.

230
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:51,120
But Oppa, do directors use two different phones?

231
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,070
I used to use a few.

232
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:55,790
But not now?

233
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:58,750
No. Why?

234
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:01,050
Do you need a burner phone?

235
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:02,690
No.

236
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,460
Hope your movie becomes a blockbuster!

237
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:11,910
Thanks. Let's go for a million viewers!

238
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:35,790
Hey, are you waiting for someone to call you?

239
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:37,020
No.

240
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:42,350
Then why are you staring at the phone since earlier like a dog that has to poop?

241
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:44,540
No, Father...

242
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:48,050
Still, if I got her out and prevented her from going to jail,

243
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:49,900
she should at least properly thank me, no?

244
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:53,110
What? Of course!

245
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:56,950
Hey, if it were someone like me, I would carry you on my back for three days.

246
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:58,550
Right?  I'm not the weird one, right?

247
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:02,680
Of course. But someone ignored it like an uneducated person?

248
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,120
There's someone.

249
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:08,900
You shouldn't even deal with rude people like that.

250
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:17,180
I mean... what?

251
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:18,580
Gosh.

252
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:30,550
Who in the world sent those messages...

253
00:22:55,800 --> 00:23:00,960
There isn't a false resident registration, plagiarizing a paper,  or false contract

254
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,770
He is too clean.

255
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:05,930
He passed the confirmation hearing unanimously in the shortest time,

256
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:09,540
and he doesn't go to the reunions although he went to a famous high school and  university.

257
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:13,960
His high school friend is the Chairman of the Board of Audit and Inspection, but he doesn't answer the call after he becomes the Minister.

258
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,350
He doesn't want to be misunderstood.

259
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:18,710
He is famous for also being clean in the documents of the National Intelligence Service.

260
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:20,880
But the relationship with the press is not good.

261
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:25,470
He is a man of principle and doesn't have a weakness that he doesn't have to kiss butts.

262
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:30,380
Right now, It is more efficient and faster to work on a green belt project with the Yongin and Yangpyeong.local governments.

263
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:34,560
We will use the opinion leaders to write the columns or editorials to create a green belt sentiment.

264
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:39,130
The conclusion is that we can't touch the Ministry of Land?

265
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:44,190
By this evening, bring me plans to take him down.

266
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:53,860
She's being excessively obsessed.

267
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:57,080
I mean if he will reject, why did he meet Director Han?

268
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,620
I think he met her on purpose.

269
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:01,180
You can clearly see the answer.

270
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:04,590
He was meeting her to hurt her pride.

271
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:08,430
Oh where's Heo Yoon Do?

272
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:14,160
He went out with Miss. I'll locate them.

273
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:44,760
His car is in Samcheong-dong.

274
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:48,350
Right. That's the only place left to go.

275
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:50,660
Samcheong-dong Milk Money?

276
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:52,780
- Yes. 
 - Milk Money?

277
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:56,160
She earns big money overseas through fund speculating and  in Korea she only earns money from interest.

278
00:24:56,160 --> 00:25:00,210
It's her philosophy on investment. She tapped into a market where she won't even lose a cent.

279
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:03,220
- But why Milk Money? 
 - A capitalist with billions to her name

280
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:08,390
goes to the department store every Tuesday to receive free organic food that they distribute

281
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:10,320
to its members.

282
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:15,520
Would someone like her lend money to Mo Seok Hui and Chairman Wang who is fading fast?

283
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,900
What is more urgent to us is the Land Minister matter.

284
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:20,860
Anyone have anything?

285
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:24,800
We don't have time, so let's hurry.

286
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:27,400
Don't give up and dig!

287
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:32,630
 We need to get ready, too. 

288
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:36,330
 Land will be hard to sell off right away, 

289
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:40,950
 so I'm looking into the Madam in Samcheong-dong who's in the private loan business for money.  

290
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,790
 She's very particular... 

291
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,550
Hello?

292
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:02,840
Hello?

293
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:29,500
Yes.

294
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:33,840
  Ma'am, we decided to go with the place that we told you about previously.  

295
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,280
Oh, the big data company in Singapore?

296
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,460
  Yes, that's right.  

297
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:41,940
Oh well, I told you. ASSAN is hot for the time being.

298
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:47,020
Negotiate investment amount with Charlie. I'm in a meeting right now.

299
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:49,840
Oh...

300
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:53,390
He's in meditation right now. He had a mental breakdown.

301
00:26:53,390 --> 00:26:56,120
After the South American investment failed.

302
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:59,040
Let's talk later, okay?

303
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,430
Why? Were you imagining a self-made loan shark who

304
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:08,990
got all her money from greasy money in Namdaemun?

305
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:12,700
Everyone did live that way. But since the beginning,

306
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:15,870
I only dealt with foreign companies and made my money.

307
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:20,560
And I only lent money to Korean companies that had promise but were lacking funds.

308
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:23,120
You're a great investor to Korean companies.

309
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:26,220
There's a lot of Korean companies I took down because they couldn't pay interest, too.

310
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:30,330
I heard. You earn money through foreign companies

311
00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:33,160
and you did a lot of good things for Korean companies,

312
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:37,860
but you're a cold capitalist who took them down if they didn't keep their promise.

313
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:40,360
Why talk so indirectly?

314
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:44,680
You could have just said I'm a cold-hearted loan shark.

315
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:51,390
But... what's the reason I should lend to MC Distribution?

316
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:54,990
Step out for a bit.

317
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:57,870
Yes. Excuse me. I'll step out.

318
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:07,400
I've known your grandfather for over 30 years.

319
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:11,390
He has a lot of affection and is kind.

320
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:16,390
Could you win against Chairman Mo Cheol Hui?

321
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:18,270
It's your father in the end.

322
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:21,260
I'm not trying to go to war with my father

323
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:24,760
but trying to find the culprit who killed my mom.

324
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:29,410
Right now, I'm gambling with you with my emotions on the line.

325
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:31,920
But why do you need the company?

326
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:34,740
It's only possible with the money and power that the company has.

327
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:38,860
That's the reason I should be lending you money?

328
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:40,880
The reason

329
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,670
is up to you to find.

330
00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:49,920
Honesty is the only thing I have.

331
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:54,290
To be more honest, it hurts my pride

332
00:28:54,290 --> 00:28:56,530
that you're deciding my fate.

333
00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:02,390
- The guy outside? 
 - He's my lawyer.

334
00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:05,760
A large tree with deep roots

335
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:09,280
- is frustrated being inside a small pot. 
 - Pardon?

336
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:13,830
When you get older, you get sillier. Time for you to go.

337
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:32,730
You are...

338
00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:39,250
just like your grandfather.

339
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:55,240
What did she say? She'll help?

340
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:52,710
  I am Mo Seok Hui.  

341
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:12,720
  I am Mo Seok Hui. I am Mo Seok Hui. I am Mo Seok Hui. 

342
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:16,200
  I am Mo Seok Hui.  

343
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:20,550
 Come on. Just a little more. 

344
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:35,890
 My daughter, what made you so upset? 

345
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,650
 Dad was... 

346
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:45,310
 too busy so he couldn't come to school. 

347
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:48,080
 But the kids keep making fun of me. 

348
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,330
 Saying maybe I don't have a dad. 

349
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:55,270
 On top of that, you didn't do well on the exam, so I guess you've been having a hard time. 

350
00:31:56,010 --> 00:31:59,670
 From now on, there will be many more difficult times. 

351
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:01,740
 Try running whenever that happens. 

352
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:05,930
 If you run, you'll feel better and the bad feelings will go away. 

353
00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:08,700
 - It was the same for you, too? 
 - Of course. 

354
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:13,510
 Since you're mine, run like me 

355
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:15,630
 and get stronger. 

356
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:20,610
 I want to run some more. 

357
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:35,730
 Of course. Since you're mine, 

358
00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:38,090
 run like me 

359
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:40,170
 and get stronger. 

360
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:55,820
So hot.

361
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:03,300
It's very like you the way you handle stress.

362
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:07,170
Whenever I'm unhappy I run.

363
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:13,390
My mom taught it to me.

364
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:17,440
It's the same as me.

365
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:21,520
If you run like this,

366
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:26,500
you feel happier and get more strength.

367
00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:31,010
Back then, I had my mom beside me who used to run with me.

368
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:40,310
I don't think there's a better friend I have than this for someone who's alone like me.

369
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:42,230
Why are you alone?

370
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:50,530
So you think I'm not a person, just an animal, who ran beside you?

371
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:58,550
I'm hungry all of a sudden.

372
00:33:58,550 --> 00:34:00,660
Ah, I'm hungry.

373
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:02,110
How about meat?

374
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:04,330
Sure.

375
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:08,160
I know a good place. Let's go.

376
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:22,260
I can tell from your expression.

377
00:34:22,990 --> 00:34:24,330
I'm going crazy.

378
00:34:24,330 --> 00:34:26,880
I even hacked into his email but have nothing.

379
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:31,380
The time's running out... Are we all gonna die today?

380
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:38,250
I'm envious of your mental strength for being able to care about your outfit at a time like this.

381
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:40,990
But... I don't think I've seen that outfit before?

382
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:45,670
I totally got obsessed with it after seeing it on the runway in Paris. I took it off the model then and there!

383
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:48,510
It's an outfit that's near impossible to find in Korea.

384
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,880
- You like it? 
 - But this outfit...

385
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:04,830
- I think I've seen it before. 
 - Where?

386
00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:16,200
- I found it. 
 - It's true!

387
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,200
It's the same.

388
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,970
- How much is this? 
 - $30,000.

389
00:35:20,970 --> 00:35:24,070
Wait. Her bag and shows are also luxury items.

390
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:26,910
- No way. 
 - Let's look at her transaction records again.

391
00:35:29,810 --> 00:35:32,320
There's nothing showing from department stores or luxury goods stores.

392
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:35,170
- If there were, I would have found them. 
 - Bribe?

393
00:35:35,170 --> 00:35:38,460
Someone with such high morals receives luxury goods as bribes?

394
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:40,820
But what is this then?

395
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:43,830
No way a Land Minister's wife would wear fake--

396
00:35:46,330 --> 00:35:48,380
You can check her texts, right?

397
00:35:56,590 --> 00:35:57,970
Let me see.

398
00:35:57,970 --> 00:36:00,080
Come for some coffee, Madam.

399
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:02,960
Madam, cookie is ready.

400
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:06,360
Madam, hibiscus smells nice.

401
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:09,300
- Isn't something odd? 
 - Sounds like a code.

402
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:11,250
Look into this number.

403
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:32,800
 She's a single woman in her 30s at apt. 1401 in the same building as the Minister's. 

404
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:43,080
  Who is it?  

405
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:47,220
Yes. I was referred to you by Madam Lee Min Jeong.

406
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:49,710
- Hello. 
 - Welcome.

407
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:53,400
If Madam Lee Min Jeong referred you, I can trust you.

408
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,700
- Take your time and look around. 
 - Yes.

409
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:59,570
Oh, but you're really stylish!

410
00:36:59,570 --> 00:37:01,320
Thank you.

411
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:06,990
Oh, I've been wanting this so badly!

412
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:11,130
Could I take some pictures?

413
00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:15,200
- Yes. But you are not allowed to upload it on Social Media.
 - Of course not.

414
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,610
You must have heard from Madam,

415
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:22,460
but our items aren't imitations but "'loss" items.

416
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:25,540
Oh! I was wondering how they looked the same as the originals.

417
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:27,800
I can see why Madam is a loyal customer.

418
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:31,300
We get a lot of wives of high-ranking officials coming along with Madam.

419
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:34,180
Even if they buy the original bags and shoes,

420
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:38,310
- the clothes are too expensive, so the loss items are popular. 
 - True.

421
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:44,040
But... how do you know Madam Lee Min Jeong

422
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:47,230
Oh, I'm the new Land Minister's secretary.

423
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:52,110
I see! We have a lot of great items, so take your time and look around.

424
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:54,630
Yes, thank you.

425
00:38:07,790 --> 00:38:11,160
- Is Director back? 
 - Not yet. What happened?

426
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:13,860
Call her right away and tell her to come quick.

427
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:15,640
And the team members, too.

428
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:24,370
 You must have already heard from Madam 

429
00:38:24,370 --> 00:38:27,990
 but our items are loss items, not imitations. 

430
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:31,510
Stop. What is a loss item?

431
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:33,310
Among the luxury items that are produced in factories

432
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:37,680
if any of them are irregular, the labels are taken off and  sold privately.

433
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,860
- Illegal? 
 - Of course.

434
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:44,830
You don't get a lot of loss items among luxury goods, so selling them is illegal.

435
00:38:44,830 --> 00:38:49,140
You call them "loss" but they're basically imitations that look like the real thing.

436
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:55,100
According to Customs Law, Article 235, it's a violation of Trade Mark Rights.

437
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:57,610
Check the Assemby's schedule of inspection of the administration.

438
00:38:57,610 --> 00:38:59,630
and call Assemblyman Choi in the Opposition Party.

439
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:00,890
Yes, Ma'am.

440
00:39:00,890 --> 00:39:03,560
By the way, how is Lawyer Yoon doing?

441
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:06,140
- He made contact with Milk Money in Samcheong-dong. 
 - Chances?

442
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:09,410
I think about 30%... but should we get to work on it?

443
00:39:09,410 --> 00:39:13,430
No. No need to fuel the fire by getting involved for nothing.

444
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:16,260
She's not someone you want to go against hastily.

445
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:19,350
In case she decides to help the other side,

446
00:39:19,350 --> 00:39:23,050
it's safer to go with the high-value investor acquisition plan.

447
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:24,440
We understand.

448
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:27,660
Everyone, you worked hard today.

449
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,250
It's delicious.

450
00:39:54,870 --> 00:39:57,720
You eat so well.

451
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:02,410
So what is it, the likes of us could never even dream about,

452
00:40:02,410 --> 00:40:06,660
that kind of family is where you must have been born, right?

453
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:11,730
Please speak to me informally. And I'm not as happy as you might imagine.

454
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:16,320
No, no. Not living your life worrying about money, rent,

455
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:20,940
mortgage, you were already born with heavenly blessings!

456
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:24,570
But our Yoon Do is so lucky that...

457
00:40:24,570 --> 00:40:27,930
an important person like you liked him.

458
00:40:28,970 --> 00:40:33,190
Anyway, for looking after my precious son so well,

459
00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:35,250
I will never forget your favor. ( As if speaking to a royalty )

460
00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:38,820
Not at all. Your son is quite capable, that's why.

461
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:41,970
You could say that's true.

462
00:40:42,810 --> 00:40:44,900
Eat while you have the appetite.

463
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:51,450
But the meat is so tasty.

464
00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:55,720
Those who know about our pork ribs know that!

465
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:59,870
But you eat so much meat. That's why you have a foul temper.

466
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:04,410
Don't condemn carnivores with facts that haven't been proven.

467
00:41:04,410 --> 00:41:06,270
Why are you like this?

468
00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:09,520
Making her lose appetite when she's been eating so well...

469
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:14,110
I'm telling you. Those who love meat have bad tempers. I know several people around me.

470
00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:15,760
There's one incoming. Hey.

471
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:18,800
Come here and eat some meat.

472
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,440
Wow, your treat?

473
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,910
But who is this?

474
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:27,670
Oh, my client. This is Choi Eun Ji, a long-time friend.

475
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:36,140
It's my treat today,

476
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:39,070
so have as much as you want.

477
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:42,960
A meat battle has started. Eat with this so it balances out your nutrition.

478
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:46,590
Right, I raised this without any pesticides.

479
00:41:46,590 --> 00:41:48,580
It's very precious. Try some.

480
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:50,650
Oh, is that so?

481
00:41:54,450 --> 00:41:56,610
It's delicious.

482
00:41:58,060 --> 00:42:01,200
- Hey, stop eating so much. 
 - Why? His food is so good.

483
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,970
But you eat it all the time without leaving me any.

484
00:42:02,970 --> 00:42:05,790
That's because you come home late all the time.

485
00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:09,830
- Seriously. 
 - I grow it on the rooftop, so there isn't a lot of it.

486
00:42:09,830 --> 00:42:14,530
- Also, the vegetables are a bit expensive these days.
 - Ow! Put it in front!

487
00:42:14,530 --> 00:42:16,540
- Seriously! 
 - Hey, hey.

488
00:42:22,010 --> 00:42:26,760
Your father has so much pride about his son.

489
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:29,570
I'm that great as you know.

490
00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:35,700
Makes me wonder how long it's been since I've had a meal with my family while laughing.

491
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:38,160
How was it when your mother was alive?

492
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:39,710
It was nice then.

493
00:42:39,710 --> 00:42:41,920
You still haven't told me.

494
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:43,280
What about?

495
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:47,020
About your mom. How she passed away.

496
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,990
I told you she died because her heart stopped.

497
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:57,900
- When did Director Han start working at MC? 
 - Not sure.

498
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:02,070
Since she was there even before I went to the States, so...

499
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,920
it would be at least 15 years.

500
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,560
Fifteen years...

501
00:43:15,790 --> 00:43:17,190
What's wrong?

502
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:22,460
It's nothing.

503
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:26,840
What about your mom?

504
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:28,710
Did she pass away?

505
00:43:30,510 --> 00:43:32,850
She's far away.

506
00:43:43,170 --> 00:43:45,000
You're here.

507
00:43:56,530 --> 00:43:58,650
Director Han, you are here.

508
00:43:58,650 --> 00:44:02,000
I am very late. Please sit down.

509
00:44:04,730 --> 00:44:07,020
Thank you for taking your time during the Assembly's inspection of the administration.

510
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:11,140
I'm honored whenever you call me.

511
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:14,390
Thank you very much for the BTS ticket the other day.

512
00:44:14,390 --> 00:44:18,830
Our youngest daughter enjoyed it so much.

513
00:44:18,830 --> 00:44:20,970
What brings you here today?

514
00:44:20,970 --> 00:44:26,730
In the parliamentary inspection of the administration, the Ministry of Land standing committee seems bored.

515
00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:28,250
Don't get me started.

516
00:44:28,250 --> 00:44:31,560
Land Minister is someone who no matter how much you look into him, there's not even dust.

517
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:34,930
He's a scary person. It's sickening.

518
00:44:34,930 --> 00:44:37,960
He's so meticulous with his work, too,

519
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:41,070
it's very difficult to be in the Opposition Party.

520
00:44:41,070 --> 00:44:46,090
But he's a three-term assemblyman, he should have at least one scandal.

521
00:45:05,570 --> 00:45:08,220
Would it be something that might be useful?

522
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:09,840
Of course it would.

523
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:13,680
As expected, the government can't hold a candle to TOP.

524
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:17,420
It's a great relief that you're on my side.

525
00:45:18,250 --> 00:45:21,450
Let's be on the same side for the rest of our lives.

526
00:45:38,230 --> 00:45:41,410
 Is this your wife? 

527
00:45:41,410 --> 00:45:43,140
  Yes, that's right.  

528
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:48,060
 The outfit and the shoes that she's wearing, do you know how much they are? 

529
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:49,520
I don't know very well.

530
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:54,250
The outfit and the shoes are luxury items.

531
00:45:54,250 --> 00:45:59,070
In terms of money, it costs millions of won. Should a wife of a public servant be wearing something like that?

532
00:45:59,070 --> 00:46:01,380
I think there's a misunderstanding.

533
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:05,060
We are not in the position to be buying luxury items,

534
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:08,620
and it's my understanding that she has never bought such items.

535
00:46:08,620 --> 00:46:10,550
Is that so?

536
00:46:10,550 --> 00:46:12,310
Then did she buy imitations?

537
00:46:12,310 --> 00:46:17,140
I have shocking testimony today.

538
00:46:18,550 --> 00:46:21,980
 Other than Madam Lee Min Jeong, a lot of high-ranking officials' wives come by. 

539
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:25,010
 They might buy original bags or shoes,  

540
00:46:25,010 --> 00:46:28,850
  but the clothes cost too much, so the loss items are popular. 

541
00:46:28,850 --> 00:46:31,420
Lee Moon Jeong is your wife, right?

542
00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:32,810
Yes, yes, that's correct.

543
00:46:32,810 --> 00:46:36,840
The wife of a Minister bought illegal fake goods!

544
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:40,110
This is a clear violation of Trade Mark Rights!

545
00:46:40,110 --> 00:46:43,170
How could you properly serve as a public servant while committing such illegal acts?!

546
00:46:43,170 --> 00:46:45,710
Minister! Resign right away!

547
00:46:45,710 --> 00:46:47,670
Take responsibility and resign!

548
00:46:47,670 --> 00:46:48,950
You need to resign!

549
00:46:48,950 --> 00:46:49,950
You have to resign!

550
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:54,650
 The Land  Minister's wife was found to be 

551
00:46:54,650 --> 00:46:58,770
 buying illegal fake luxury items during the Assembly's audit of the administration. 

552
00:46:58,770 --> 00:47:00,400
 It's making a huge impact. 

553
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:04,610
 Buying fake items is against the law, 

554
00:47:04,610 --> 00:47:06,690
 in violation of Trade Mark Rights. 

555
00:47:06,690 --> 00:47:09,140
 The Land  Minister apologized, but the citizens' response 

556
00:47:09,140 --> 00:47:11,130
 is that he needs to resign. 

557
00:47:11,130 --> 00:47:12,680
 The Opposition Party insists not only the Land Minister's 

558
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:14,720
 but also many of other government officials' wives 

559
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:17,060
 are involved in the illegal act that 

560
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:19,850
 they vowed to start a full investigation. 

561
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:24,120
I think he will step down.

562
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:27,110
So he should haven't been so arrogant.

563
00:47:27,110 --> 00:47:29,270
Why did he hurt Director Han's pride?

564
00:47:29,270 --> 00:47:31,500
It's going to be a week max even if he holds on.

565
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:36,640
Number 1 through 5 of most searched words are in reference to the fake goods news.

566
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:37,940
I don't think he can last a whole week.

567
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:43,620
Bringing down the Land Minister by manipulating the press...

568
00:47:43,620 --> 00:47:46,320
isn't that too underhanded?

569
00:47:53,050 --> 00:47:55,140
Follow me.

570
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:11,210
What TOP did was illegal.

571
00:48:11,210 --> 00:48:13,690
The difference between legal and illegal?

572
00:48:13,690 --> 00:48:16,500
It's as vague as figuring out the difference between businessman and a scam artist.

573
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:19,920
No. It's very clear what the difference is between a businessman and a scam artist.

574
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:22,990
A scam is a crime.

575
00:48:22,990 --> 00:48:25,850
Lawyer Heo, don't be so mature yet.

576
00:48:25,850 --> 00:48:27,650
You're still too young to be so mature.

577
00:48:27,650 --> 00:48:29,870
At your age, you need to be loyal to your ambition.

578
00:48:29,870 --> 00:48:31,570
That's much more beautiful.

579
00:48:31,570 --> 00:48:35,640
But the ambition doesn't have to go side-by-side with illegal acts.

580
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:42,140
You're an idealist as expected.

581
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:45,330
Can I ask you something?

582
00:48:45,330 --> 00:48:47,890
I heard you're from the best family of legal professionals,

583
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:52,200
and you've had the honor of being a judge and never lacked anything. But why, here,  ...

584
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:56,570
No one threatened to kill me if I didn't work here.

585
00:48:58,150 --> 00:49:01,210
It was cool to meet the world through law.

586
00:49:01,210 --> 00:49:05,460
But in that organization, there was a limit to how much I could live out my dream.

587
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:09,770
So you chose MC Group?

588
00:49:09,770 --> 00:49:13,410
At TOP, anything is possible.

589
00:49:14,350 --> 00:49:18,890
In your eyes we might look as though we're protecting one company,

590
00:49:18,890 --> 00:49:22,210
but protecting MC means protecting many employees

591
00:49:22,210 --> 00:49:26,100
and in the end, we're protecting this country.

592
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:28,260
Imagine in my hands,

593
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:30,450
in TOP's hands,

594
00:49:31,530 --> 00:49:35,550
that great nation is being controlled.

595
00:49:35,550 --> 00:49:37,750
Isn't it exciting?

596
00:49:40,650 --> 00:49:43,870
You have the right to be proud.

597
00:50:10,730 --> 00:50:14,340
 News of Parliamentary Audit  

598
00:50:35,820 --> 00:50:39,070
Director Han is coming.

599
00:50:39,070 --> 00:50:41,650
Oh, welcome. Have a drink.

600
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:44,000
You worked hard.

601
00:50:51,460 --> 00:50:55,860
Director Mo, you better be careful not to get on her bad side.

602
00:50:55,860 --> 00:50:57,580
Yes. I'll bear that in mind.

603
00:50:57,580 --> 00:51:00,430
Chairman, you are very funny.

604
00:51:03,670 --> 00:51:06,580
So, when will the Land Minister step down?

605
00:51:06,580 --> 00:51:10,030
The Blue House is already in the process of looking for a replacement.

606
00:51:10,030 --> 00:51:10,820
Who's the prime candidate?

607
00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:13,250
I think my college senior has the best chance.

608
00:51:13,250 --> 00:51:16,600
That's great. Set up a meeting with him.

609
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:20,170
I've already met with him since he contacted us first.

610
00:51:20,170 --> 00:51:23,720
Director Mo, if you have Director Han,

611
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:26,700
you have nothing in the world to be afraid of.

612
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:28,390
Yes.

613
00:51:29,110 --> 00:51:32,630
Your college senior doesn't waste any time.

614
00:51:32,630 --> 00:51:38,630
There are a few issues we have to clear up at the confirmation hearing but I’ll get it done without fail for him.

615
00:51:57,450 --> 00:52:01,140
Did something bad happen today?

616
00:52:01,140 --> 00:52:04,570
Who do you think has the most power in Korea?

617
00:52:04,570 --> 00:52:06,710
Huh?

618
00:52:06,710 --> 00:52:08,040
The president?

619
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:13,010
No. Capital. Intelligence.

620
00:52:13,010 --> 00:52:17,810
In the end, the one with the most intelligence that has the capital is the most powerful.

621
00:52:17,810 --> 00:52:22,210
Chasing out a Minister and putting people in jail and making an ordinary person into a criminal,

622
00:52:22,210 --> 00:52:24,930
they can do anything they set their mind to.

623
00:52:24,930 --> 00:52:28,710
Are you having a hard time at work?

624
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:33,500
If you act according to law there's no way to beat them.

625
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:40,340
I might have to become even dirtier in order to win against them.

626
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:45,730
I don’t know... if this is the right job for me.

627
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:51,620
At least eat some snacks. Here.

628
00:52:57,140 --> 00:53:02,850
There’s been no action from Samcheong-dong up til now.

629
00:53:02,850 --> 00:53:06,590
Once the new Minister is appointed,  that green belt designation is a fixed fact,

630
00:53:06,590 --> 00:53:08,550
Samcheong-dong will have knowledge of it, too,

631
00:53:08,550 --> 00:53:12,500
so the money shouldn’t be handed to Seok Hui.

632
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:15,350
We’ve blocked any possible sources of funds to the other side,

633
00:53:15,350 --> 00:53:18,440
and we’ve convinced four of our largest shareholders,

634
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:23,790
so you’ll become the largest shareholder of MC Group tomorrow.

635
00:53:23,790 --> 00:53:25,080
It’s my own thought,

636
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:29,830
but when the whole family is gathered at the 30th death anniversary of Madam Kim Eul Boon,

637
00:53:29,830 --> 00:53:32,840
I think it would be good to do a proclamation ceremony of the CEO.

638
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:35,660
Bravo. Bravo!

639
00:53:39,690 --> 00:53:41,650
Outstanding.

640
00:53:49,830 --> 00:53:53,950
That man has to regain consciousness in order for Seok Hui to inherit.

641
00:53:53,950 --> 00:53:55,290
Is there any chance?

642
00:53:55,290 --> 00:53:58,520
I’m sure he will get up.

643
00:53:59,290 --> 00:54:03,190
One generation passes by like this....

644
00:54:04,020 --> 00:54:07,230
The money... take it.

645
00:54:07,230 --> 00:54:08,290
Pardon?

646
00:54:08,290 --> 00:54:10,910
She’s fundamentally a good person.

647
00:54:10,910 --> 00:54:14,790
Company operation isn’t only done with finances I learned.

648
00:54:14,790 --> 00:54:17,660
I can see now that I’ve lived a while.

649
00:54:17,660 --> 00:54:19,980
Being daring when young is a virtue.

650
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:22,830
Thank you for thinking so well of her.

651
00:54:22,830 --> 00:54:27,410
In return, sign this.

652
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:40,200
You want the right to sell 50% of Chairman Wang’s shares in MC Distribution at any time?

653
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:45,600
In case something goes wrong with MC Distribution? I can't afford to lose.

654
00:55:03,510 --> 00:55:08,130
Chairman Wang, everything is ready so you can give your assets to the Miss.

655
00:55:08,130 --> 00:55:10,910
All you need to do is wake up.

656
00:55:21,250 --> 00:55:23,900
CEO is coming.

657
00:55:31,350 --> 00:55:38,830
Today, it's a 30th death anniversary of my mom.

658
00:55:38,830 --> 00:55:45,340
Seok Hui, since it's your first time after becoming an adult, be respectful.

659
00:55:46,180 --> 00:55:51,530
That father couldn't make it here today,

660
00:55:51,530 --> 00:55:54,740
it’s a grievous thing.

661
00:55:54,740 --> 00:55:59,250
Mother was an intelligent woman who graduated from Jinjoo Girls' High School.

662
00:55:59,250 --> 00:56:04,240
For all of her life, she served father and lived an ideal life as a women.

663
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:10,070
For generations, we have inherited her mindset.

664
00:56:10,070 --> 00:56:12,510
We fast before the ceremony

665
00:56:12,510 --> 00:56:16,090
and we commemorate her while drinking tea.

666
00:56:17,590 --> 00:56:20,590
Everyone, pay a silent tribute.

667
00:56:23,930 --> 00:56:25,730
Back to position.

668
00:56:26,940 --> 00:56:28,700
Let's sit.

669
00:56:35,390 --> 00:56:40,750
This Five Dragon tea cleans your soul.

670
00:56:40,750 --> 00:56:43,670
Today, since it’s an occasion where all of our MC Group’s

671
00:56:43,670 --> 00:56:49,940
Mo family and extended relatives are present, Seok Hui,

672
00:56:50,730 --> 00:56:53,920
pay attention to maintaining your dignity.

673
00:56:55,190 --> 00:56:58,020
Now, let’s drink.

674
00:57:16,270 --> 00:57:18,890
Open the door right now!

675
00:57:18,890 --> 00:57:20,820
No.

676
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:23,390
You are new right?

677
00:57:23,390 --> 00:57:25,450
I'm Choi Na Ri! Do you not know me?

678
00:57:25,450 --> 00:57:26,580
Open!

679
00:57:26,580 --> 00:57:29,930
No one but family can enter, it's an order.

680
00:57:30,870 --> 00:57:36,210
My son is in there, if I'm not  family, who would be?

681
00:57:36,210 --> 00:57:40,730
If you get fired, I’m not responsible!

682
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:43,750
Call the CEO right away!

683
00:57:45,620 --> 00:57:48,440
Emergency, emergency!

684
00:57:50,190 --> 00:57:52,890
Director Han is here.

685
00:58:11,420 --> 00:58:17,030
By the way, Grandma didn't go to Jinjoo Girls' High.

686
00:58:17,030 --> 00:58:18,400
What are you talking about?

687
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:21,940
She didn't even graduate from elementary school, and couldn't read.

688
00:58:23,770 --> 00:58:27,170
Hyung, what's the eye of an ignoramus?

689
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:28,660
Not knowing how to read.

690
00:58:28,660 --> 00:58:32,430
Professional term is illiteracy.

691
00:58:33,310 --> 00:58:36,520
Why did the grandma not go to the school? Was she a bully?

692
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:40,050
In the past, they couldn't afford it.

693
00:58:40,050 --> 00:58:44,440
Also, Grandfather had so many affairs that

694
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:48,530
- she suffered from depression her whole life and killed herself. 
 - Heol!

695
00:58:48,530 --> 00:58:50,640
Who blabbered all that nonsense?

696
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:53,920
I heard it long ago from the nanny who raised me

697
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:57,300
Seok Hui, you heard too, no? Don't you remember?

698
00:58:57,380 --> 00:59:01,920
Re-packaging a dead person according to the taste of those still living

699
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:04,610
is this family's tradition.

700
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:36,740
I'm the daughter-in-law who gave birth to a child who has the blood of Mo running through his veins.

701
00:59:36,740 --> 00:59:38,770
There’s no reason I can’t attend the ceremony.

702
00:59:38,770 --> 00:59:41,390
There is only one Madam in Mo's family.

703
00:59:41,390 --> 00:59:44,190
You signed the contract, right?

704
00:59:44,190 --> 00:59:49,370
What are you gonna do? I'm going to write a contract with the Chairman again today.

705
00:59:49,370 --> 00:59:53,100
You could get arrested for breaking the law for interrupting the ceremony.

706
00:59:53,100 --> 00:59:56,330
Director Han. Stop bluffing.

707
00:59:56,330 --> 00:59:58,710
There is no such law for interrupting a ceremony.

708
00:59:58,710 --> 01:00:00,590
Article 158 of Criminal Law,

709
01:00:00,590 --> 01:00:04,240
if you interrupt the funeral or death ceremony, you will will face up to three years in prison or

710
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:07,690
a fine not exceeding 3,000,000 won.

711
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:12,120
Go to the library.

712
01:00:21,700 --> 01:00:28,800
Did you forget your agreement not to enter this house without my permission

713
01:00:29,570 --> 01:00:31,800
Honey,

714
01:00:32,610 --> 01:00:35,630
Honey, are you mad?

715
01:00:35,630 --> 01:00:41,400
You are so sexy when you are mad.

716
01:00:44,180 --> 01:00:48,950
Honey, til when I should be hiding like this?

717
01:00:48,950 --> 01:00:52,260
It was you who couldn't give up on the acting career.

718
01:00:52,260 --> 01:00:55,310
No, I changed my mind.

719
01:00:55,310 --> 01:00:57,290
I don’t have to act.

720
01:00:57,290 --> 01:01:03,420
Now I want to confidentially reveal that I'm yours.

721
01:01:03,420 --> 01:01:07,120
There won’t be a change in inheritance.

722
01:01:07,120 --> 01:01:09,680
Therefore, shut up.

723
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:11,720
Honey, you’re so—

724
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:15,540
Do you not want to see Seo Jin for the rest of your life?

725
01:01:15,540 --> 01:01:17,570
Is that what you want?

726
01:01:18,210 --> 01:01:21,720
How dare you think you can just come here when you want?

727
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:24,380
Stay quiet until I call you.

728
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:48,650
Between dog and fox, choose one between two.

729
01:01:48,650 --> 01:01:50,970
I'll take whatever’s given.

730
01:01:51,620 --> 01:01:57,850
You are a dirty dog kissing Chairman Mo's butt for your whole life.

731
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:03,870
You must know you are now too old to behave coquettishly.

732
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:08,440
For coming to the 30th death anniversary of my mother like this,

733
01:03:08,440 --> 01:03:11,970
I thank you.

734
01:03:11,970 --> 01:03:19,420
Wishing for MC Group’s founder Chairman Mo Wang Pyo to get well,

735
01:03:20,690 --> 01:03:22,350
Cheers!

736
01:03:22,350 --> 01:03:24,490
Cheers!

737
01:03:28,900 --> 01:03:31,590
Here comes Chairman Wang.

738
01:03:55,430 --> 01:03:59,670
Today, since many of MC Distribution board of directors are here

739
01:03:59,670 --> 01:04:05,990
Chairman Mo Wang Pyo has something to say personally.

740
01:04:09,170 --> 01:04:14,410
I, Mo Wang Pyo, will give MC Distribution

741
01:04:14,410 --> 01:04:20,620
and all of the real estate to my granddaughter Mo Seok Hui.

742
01:04:38,920 --> 01:04:45,890


743
01:04:45,890 --> 01:04:48,550
♫  Black Diamond  ♫

744
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:56,810
♫  You and I to that place  ♫

745
01:04:56,810 --> 01:04:59,340
♫  Black Diamond  ♫

746
01:05:02,360 --> 01:05:07,310
♫  The Paradise for just the two of us  ♫

747
01:05:07,310 --> 01:05:09,660
  Graceful Family  

748
01:05:09,660 --> 01:05:11,280
Playing dual roles?

749
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:14,770
Find out why Miss is not appropriate to be a CEO.

750
01:05:14,770 --> 01:05:16,160
Today is the day of meeting for stockholders.

751
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:16,760
Congratulations.

752
01:05:16,760 --> 01:05:21,400
Get Mo Seok Hui out of my sight!

753
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:22,320
Drag her out!

754
01:05:22,320 --> 01:05:23,360
I'm walking out on my own.

755
01:05:23,360 --> 01:05:25,480
Tell me what you really want to do.

756
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:26,550
Why would I?

757
01:05:26,550 --> 01:05:27,370
I'm worried.

758
01:05:27,370 --> 01:05:28,850
Then did you approach me for a reason?

759
01:05:28,850 --> 01:05:29,950
TOP sent you?

760
01:05:29,950 --> 01:05:31,890
So? Did you obtain the answer?

761
01:05:31,890 --> 01:05:33,570
The self-confidence that you’re a King-maker.

762
01:05:33,570 --> 01:05:38,860
Now, why don't you bet on me?
