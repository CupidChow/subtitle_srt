00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:40,000


7
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,970
 Should we... hurry up and get married and have a kid?  

8
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:03,190
 I don't want to get married before I succeed. 

9
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:06,710
 - Please marry me! Please! 
 - I don't want to!  

10
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:11,520
 Let me butt in! Makes it hard to live for a single girl like me! 

11
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,700
 Ta-da!  

12
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:20,260
 I'm gonna go swim then.  

13
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,560
 Isn't he cute? 

14
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:38,980
 Yeah, it kills me that he's so cute, you wench. 

15
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:45,620
 I heard the rumors of you dating a second generation chaebol. That was Oppa Wan Soo? 

16
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:48,800
 Did you guys sleep together? 

17
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,650
 Have you gone mad? 

18
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:57,070
 He is more innocent than he looks. He told me that I am his first love. 

19
00:01:57,070 --> 00:02:00,410
 Hey, but you got in the wrong line. 

20
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:02,160
 What do you mean? 

21
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:08,000
 I hear Wan Soo is the black sheep of the family. The second son is next in line. 

22
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,270
 I hear he's the heir. 

23
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:15,610
 Ever since he was child, Wan Soo has been considered an incompetent rock-head. 

24
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:18,170
 Didn't you notice while dating him? 

25
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:26,010
 Choi Na Ri's ambition to become a top star with the halo of the chaebol family 

26
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:29,150
 was completely beyond our imagination. 

27
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:06,190
 Unsatisfied with the incompetent son, she set her sights on the powerful father. 

28
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,800
 Her persistence ultimately struck a bullseye and 

29
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:39,990
 the son felt betrayed and inadequate and his psyche became more and more insecure. 

30
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:55,960
 Graceful Family  
   Episode 9  

31
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:59,100
All of you have saved more money  then the  annual income from the MC Group subsidiaries

32
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:04,350
by blocking an amendment to the inheritance law. Good job.

33
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:08,320
Moving forward, please take good care of Director Mo.

34
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,340
Let's make a toast.

35
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:18,840
To TOP's hard work and Director Mo's future, Cheers!

36
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:19,720
Cheers!

37
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:23,360
Isn't it too early for champagne?

38
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:36,340
Meet the new MC's family member who will be here from today on, the third mom.

39
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:47,260
Good evening.

40
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:56,590
♬  Hey Give it to me ♬

41
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:59,790
♬  Give it your best why don't you try  ♬

42
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:06,620
♬  Hey Give it to me ♬

43
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:10,570
♬  But your best can't hold me back  ♬

44
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,960
Take a seat, Stepmom.

45
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:26,640
♬  I'm on fire, I'm on fire ♬ 

46
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,690
Or, is it Small Stepmom?

47
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:32,930
Big Stepmom, Small Stepmom.

48
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:38,960
I like those titles. Right, Father?

49
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:50,780
It's a good night but ...it's a shame we have an uninvited guest.

50
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:54,420
Son, you like it now that I'm here, right?

51
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:58,780
From now on, you are going to live with me, ok?

52
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,200
Let's settle this.

53
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:27,300
You don't have eye surgery just because a bug crawled into your eye.

54
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:31,390
We are supposed to be here today to congratulate Mo Sang Moo's future today,

55
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:35,520
Here. Let's all drink a special toast.

56
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:38,730
Bravo.

57
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:42,630
You, come see me.

58
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:44,180
I won't say it twice, get out.

59
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:47,160
I didn't come somewhere I should't have.

60
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,430
You are not supposed to come in here.

61
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:51,380
Why?

62
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:05,640
I didn't plan on coming here from the get go.

63
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:08,380
To someone who was making a good living as an actress,

64
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:12,360
it wasn't enough  for you to make me penniless,

65
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:15,840
but you also made it impossible for me to ever make a comeback.

66
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:25,010
You don't know how many hardships I had to endure to get here.

67
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:30,250
Because I sold everything I owned to pay the penalties for breach of various contracts,

68
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:33,050
I don't have a house to go back to now.

69
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:41,280
All I have left is my flesh and blood.  Seo Jin is the only one.

70
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:45,810
But as soon as gave birth, you took him from me.

71
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:49,480
The way things are

72
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:55,570
just where am I supposed to go?

73
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:58,850
Now there is no place for me.

74
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:01,400
There is nowhere other than here.

75
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:06,720
Director Han will also approve of this.

76
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:12,640
Because she already knew I was coming to this house.

77
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:23,750
I know you are a good man.

78
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,970
I'm going to depend on you.

79
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:32,570
From now on calling you big sister-in-law would be better right, "big sis"?

80
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,190
Disrespectful bitch.

81
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:52,730
Did you decide?

82
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:55,040
What do you think about it?

83
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,750
Just let her stay in the house.

84
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:04,800
Madam is coming.

85
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:14,800
Since when were you such a humanitarian?

86
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,920
Did you want to receive a Nobel prize or something?

87
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:22,950
Director Han, are you a Peeping Tom?

88
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:26,030
The Chairman is in a complex situation, so I might understand.

89
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:29,960
Aren't you supposed to stop something like this from happening?

90
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:32,740
Why are you a silent observer?

91
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:35,140
As an MC Group executive?

92
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:37,100
Keep quiet.

93
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:43,170
Why should Seo Jin's mother stay here?

94
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:45,900
Although, we have completely cleaned up Choi Na Ri,

95
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:48,710
there are more parasites feeding off the private lives

96
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:51,170
of the MC family than I thought.

97
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,070
There was a reporter working with the country's largest publisher,

98
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:58,930
who was working on Choi Na Ri's autobiography,  but I've stopped him for now.

99
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:00,890
If the book were published,

100
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:05,700
it would place Choi Na Ri on broadcasts every where and expose MC Group.

101
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:10,600
If you leave Choi Na Ri alone, I'm sure she'll be contacted some other way again.

102
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,280
I think it's more prudent to keep her fenced in

103
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:17,560
than for her to be receiving scratches while roaming outside.

104
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:21,770
Then, how long do I have to wait and see that fool?

105
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:25,340
You're a wise woman aren't you?

106
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:29,710
She's not even a worthy rival ...  you don't need to respond to her.

107
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:35,080
She won't be able to hold on for long. So, when she asks us to let her out,

108
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,090
we will send her far away.

109
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:40,650
Well, if it's your plan, I guess, well ...

110
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:44,230
You stay outside for now.

111
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:57,370
In any case, it seems you were expecting Seo Jin's mother to come here.

112
00:14:57,370 --> 00:14:58,910
Of course.

113
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:02,140
Shouldn't you have told me first?

114
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:05,630
I didn't want to bother you.

115
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:09,780
But I've already been bothered.

116
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:15,260
If I had been informed in advance, some other way might have been found.

117
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,760
I apologize.

118
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,620
I'll see you tomorrow morning.

119
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,350
Yes.

120
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:49,230
It happened as you wanted.

121
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,270
Then ...

122
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:59,370
Just as you changed the person you serve from Grandfather to Father,

123
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:04,020
couldn't it change from Ha Yeong Seo to Choi Na Ri?

124
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,010
I'm looking forward to it.

125
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:12,140
Anyway, an autobiography of Choi Na Ri was a good idea.

126
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:14,340
It was good because your response was rapid.

127
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:16,260
Was I?

128
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,780
Choi Na Ri's autobiography?

129
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:30,180
Yes.  Choi Na Ri's and MC Group's tangled melodrama story. Well.

130
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:32,030
I think it's still going to sell in the market.

131
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:35,410
Of course.  But as long as TOP exists, it is Mission Impossible.

132
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:38,270
You're not avoiding it because you're in a symbiotic relationship with TOP are you?

133
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:41,410
Thanks so much for not calling me a parasite.

134
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:49,060
 Publishing Contract 

135
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:52,120
Did Choi Na Ri really agree to the publication?

136
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:55,380
But it won't get published.

137
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:58,150
Editor Kim, make a deal with TOP using this.

138
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:02,180
They will probably pay you for giving it up.

139
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:07,830
Just sit and collect the money.

140
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:11,150
There's no reason to refuse, is there?

141
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:17,720
Wait, wait, wait.  So you  are just giving a warning that Choi Na Ri will publish?

142
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,890
Now you're talking.

143
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:21,130
What's the reason?

144
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:24,080
I don't have to explain to you.

145
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,940
But then why did you choose News Patch?

146
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:29,060
Because you have a symbiotic relationship with TOP so why not with me?

147
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:30,270
I know, right?

148
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:34,650
Nevertheless, if I still wanted to know the reason why?

149
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:42,270
Consideration for the courage of a reporter  who probed a murder case 15 years ago?

150
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:48,520
Or, a proposal that I want to become your friend?

151
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:52,650
A proposal? That's a wonderful word.

152
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:54,530
Then, I also.

153
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,020
No matter how much we work together,

154
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:13,530
it doesn't mean you may walk into my room without my permission.

155
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:16,050
There are things which must be maintained.

156
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:20,620
Maybe you'r right. Sorry.

157
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:23,570
You said you didn't even want to glance over here at our family

158
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:25,890
but you're fitting right in.

159
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:31,960
So what benefit can I get now?

160
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:37,590
You're putting pressure on them by just being here.

161
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:40,110
I'm sure they are going to come to the negotiating table.

162
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:43,550
Then get whatever you want.

163
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:54,780
But ... I am attracted to this house.

164
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:58,900
I should say it feels like it was my own home from the start.

165
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:04,990
I really want it.

166
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:10,010
Don't look at this household members as pushovers.

167
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:13,520
Don't listen to me with half an ear.

168
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:17,670
Even so, how people live are all the same.

169
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:22,500
From now, I will take care of my own work.

170
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,820
What's this?

171
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:36,300
Your welcome gift for coming into the MC family.

172
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,600
 Ha Yeong Seo Schedule 

173
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:44,920
Do well.

174
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:03,590
You. Where did you just come from?

175
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:06,410
Can't you tell?

176
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:09,870
What do you think this room is? How dare you enter it!

177
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:13,400
While using separate rooms, why are you so obsessed about whom he sleeps with?

178
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,770
- It's unbecoming for your age? 
 - What?

179
00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:18,230
I don't like this room either.

180
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:20,710
It's saturated with your smell.

181
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:27,400
So I would like to remodel the annex as our couple's bedroom.

182
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:31,500
♫  Hey Give it to me  ♫

183
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:35,020
♫  Give it your best why don't you try.   ♫

184
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:41,580
♫  Hey Give it to me  ♫

185
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:45,130
♫  But your best can't hold me back.  ♫

186
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:48,960
This is why you let her stay in this house?

187
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,630
What nonsense are you spouting from early in the morning?

188
00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:04,720
♫  I'm on fire I'm on fire  ♫

189
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:15,180
♫  You are liar You are liar  ♫

190
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:22,250
Yoon Do, it's late. Come on.  Get up!

191
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:29,800
Have you been working hard?  You overslept.

192
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,620
I guess I was tired.

193
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:40,070
Say.  I heard that Choi Na Ri is one of the MC Group people.

194
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:41,880
MC Group people ...what is that?

195
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:47,050
Anyway, she gave birth to a member of their family, so isn't she family?

196
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:52,160
Because you are an MC employee, don't you think you could possibly meet her?

197
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:57,060
I can't say. Well. She has nothing to do with my job.

198
00:21:58,070 --> 00:22:02,120
Hey, Yoon Do.  There. Take a look at that wall over there.

199
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:06,500
Doesn't the wall look bare?

200
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:09,500
I mean, we're a popular blogged-about restaurant.

201
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:15,700
I wish I had something like a celebrity autograph to put there.

202
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:22,260
Perhaps while you are at work, I wish you could get just one autograph.

203
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:26,580
Father, Choi Na Ri isn't in a situation where she can be giving autographs.

204
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:29,330
And she's gone into seclusion so I don't know where she is.

205
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:31,270
She's not even at her house I heard!

206
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:40,470
But why do I feel like you're not being honest with me?

207
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:45,680
Jeez.   I'm telling you the truth.

208
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,520
You're right.

209
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:52,610
Why would I deserve something like Choi Na Ri's autograph?

210
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:55,270
While killing myself working hard for this restaurant

211
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:57,900
It will be lucky if I grow old and die after living a long life.

212
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:00,750
How dare I want something of the kind?

213
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:03,710
A pine caterpillar should only eat pine needles.

214
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:08,310
I can't believe I said something so ridiculous as harvesting Rudolph's antlers from early in the morning.

215
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:12,480
Maybe it's time for me to die. Sorry, Son.

216
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,070
Father.

217
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:16,730
Sorry, Son.

218
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:19,090
It's heavy.  Yoon Do.

219
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:20,930
What's with all the onions?

220
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:24,450
Mom wanted you to have them saying she got a ton sent up from the countryside.

221
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:29,320
What kind of -- I'm so grateful to her for thinking of us, too!

222
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:33,560
What can I do? I'm so thankful, but every time we benefit so much!

223
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,790
Seriously... Wow...

224
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:39,700
The onions are so firm. They are going to be sweet.

225
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:43,100
You're so strong. Wasn't it heavy? You should have called me.

226
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:49,930
- I met reporter Oh Gwang Mi, and we have become really close. 
 - Is that so?

227
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:54,580
She was really envious that we compliment each other.

228
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:59,210
You can't talk carelessly about me to the reporter.

229
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:00,180
Why?

230
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:06,910
The reporters are snooping around because they suspect Mo Seok Hui and I are in a relationship.

231
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:09,490
Are you two really in some kind of relationship?

232
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:16,730
That's not it. I'm telling you to be careful. There's nothing wrong with being careful.

233
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:21,830
Hey, hey., hey.  Son, you have to eat!

234
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:26,460
No matter what the job,  he's always wanted to eat first.

235
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:30,490
I guess the company work is pretty  difficult.

236
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:38,600
Youngest master is entering.

237
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:53,410
So crude... What's with that dress?

238
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:57,790
Why not just go around in your underwear like before?

239
00:24:57,790 --> 00:25:03,340
Oh, I can't help it since I am so sensitive to heat.

240
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:08,310
That's why I can't take a trip to Southeast Asia, Big Sis.

241
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:13,490
But, why do you care what I am wearing?

242
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:15,980
Are you maybe jealous of my body?

243
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:20,390
No, no, no.

244
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:27,500
In the future at mealtime, don't wear anything which doesn't cover your knees.

245
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:30,000
All right.

246
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:34,770
Our breakfast table is so impressive.

247
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:40,080
Koreans should eat rice.

248
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,320
Honey, you like Korean cuisine.

249
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:46,840
How about some rice and fresh water clam soup?

250
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,880
That would be great.

251
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:57,120
The nutritionist decides our menu to balance our diet. Don't go overboard.

252
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:01,750
Isn't the fast track to health laughing a lot and living happily?

253
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:06,980
Honey, I'll make it that way for you. Like last night.

254
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:09,200
Really, you!

255
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:15,040
What are you talking about?

256
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:17,450
Where's Director Han?

257
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:18,990
She'll be here soon.

258
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:22,980
Wan Joon, come to the study as soon as you finish eating.

259
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:24,400
Yes.

260
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:34,140
The Chairman won't need Oriental medicine or whatnot from now on.

261
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:36,920
I'll take care of everything and make him healthier than anyone...

262
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:42,180
No, younger than anyone else, so turn off your worries, Big Sis.

263
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:43,770
Is that right?

264
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,370
You've outdone yourself.

265
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:21,100
No matter how elegant and classy a woman acts,

266
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:23,960
she can't stand to see her man being snatched away.

267
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:30,050
I only stood in front of the room exactly at the time she delivers his Oriental medicine.

268
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:34,580
Ha Yeong Seo ... Poor her.

269
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:36,520
Exactly what was she imagining?

270
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:41,010
Since you're an actress, you put on a good show after all. What's next?

271
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:43,310
One hit isn't enough.

272
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:47,490
A home run is needed to be a proper athlete.

273
00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:48,640
A home run?

274
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,340
Look forward to it.

275
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:04,550
Is it because of this woman? Seems like it's been a while.

276
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:09,750
With this, you're not blameless for a divorce, no?

277
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:12,620
Are you now delusional, too, in order to get a beneficial divorce negotiation?

278
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:16,260
Delusional? You're funny.

279
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:20,650
You got a condo to use with a woman other than your wife, but I'm delusional?

280
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:24,640
Why not insist you're studying the Buddhist scriptures together in there?

281
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:28,980
Our divorce won't happen the way you want.

282
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,930
Just tell me the amount you want.

283
00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:39,610
It's a waste of your life taking the time out to do useless things, don't you think?

284
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:42,940
Whether I waste it or overspend, it's my life.

285
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:46,530
Since when were you so concerned about my life? It's nauseating!

286
00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:53,040
All this time, you suffered a lot while acting to try to hide your black inner soul.

287
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:57,520
A woman who got married over money even though there was no love.

288
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,930
That fits you to a T.

289
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,080
Where's the handkerchief with my initials on it?

290
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,890
Why would you ask about your things?

291
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:11,870
Why aren't my things in their place?!

292
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:15,160
I don't know! I don't care!

293
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:25,960
He trembles nervous over just one handkerchief. Like a girl.

294
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,140
Are you going to work?

295
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:40,650
You took my handkerchief, didn't you?

296
00:30:40,650 --> 00:30:43,240
What? What are you...

297
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:49,280
Oh, that! Last time, I borrowed it when I attended an opening of a colleague of mine.

298
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,590
Where is it? Bring it.

299
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:54,620
That is... That night I drank so much and fell asleep at home.

300
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:57,540
And when I got up in the morning, it was gone.

301
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:58,820
I must have lost it.

302
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:00,860
Does that even make sen-...

303
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:04,850
Is that something you should be saying? Find it.

304
00:31:04,850 --> 00:31:10,460
Seriously, punk. Over one  handkerchief you're acting up like this so early in the morning!

305
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:16,500
This is why you don't succeed.

306
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:21,340
Someone who has no concept of what's his or mine, what could he possibly do?

307
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:24,970
The fact that we're brothers is really... offensive.

308
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:30,140
You're meeting up with Director Han today, right?

309
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:37,870
Whether you can keep being this rude to me after you've met up with her...

310
00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:39,980
Let's see.

311
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:44,120
Brother.

312
00:31:48,770 --> 00:31:54,220
Everyone has a plan for a perfect life.

313
00:31:54,220 --> 00:32:00,190
Until they get beat up when they step into the ring, that is.

314
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,660
The shares that you have from Miss Mo Seok Hui we'll leave alone.

315
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:21,360
The rest will be transferred over to Director Mo,

316
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:25,340
so in reality, the management succession is all done.

317
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:28,060
You worked hard. 
      

318
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:33,760
We're thinking about a formal announcement after the general election next year and taking our time.

319
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,470
Is there a reason we should do that?

320
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:37,280
You're still healthy,

321
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:42,510
so if you announce the successor so soon, people will talk.

322
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:46,410
Unless you have a special reason...

323
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:51,470
Well, there isn't a special reason per se.

324
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:55,550
Wan Joon is young, so there are plenty of powers that will try to keep him in check.

325
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:58,220
I have to make sure he finds a stable foothold.

326
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:01,320
Anyway, we'll announce it sometime after next year.

327
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:05,740
Fine. It's good to be flexible and make our move depending on the total situation, too.

328
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:09,390
From today, your title will change to a VP within the Group.

329
00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:11,530
And we'll give you the business report first as well.

330
00:33:11,530 --> 00:33:15,600
But the final decisions will be made by the Chairman.

331
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:18,400
That goes without saying.

332
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:26,160
But... what happens to the Group if I don't take part in handling our business?

333
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:38,330
I just wanted to confirm there are no alternatives to me.

334
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:44,640
Also... doesn't Hyung have too many shares?

335
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:48,620
You have to take care of the eldest's shares in order to prevent future issues.

336
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:50,770
But still, 10% seems like too much.

337
00:33:50,770 --> 00:33:54,530
Wan Soo has no interest in management. Who cares?

338
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:57,710
Director Han will take good care of that.

339
00:33:57,710 --> 00:34:01,990
You will also need the confidence and guts that suits the VP title, no?

340
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:04,150
I'm sure.

341
00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:08,790
You get all the signatures on the family giving up their shares.

342
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:10,610
I understand.

343
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:30,190
You... do you know why I am

344
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:32,760
hurrying along your succession?

345
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,320
Is it because you don't trust me?

346
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:44,660
More than anything, Director Han is unnerving.

347
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:48,060
You mean...

348
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:53,080
Whether you become the successor or not

349
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:56,210
is in Director Han's hands.

350
00:34:56,210 --> 00:34:58,980
She is a double-edged sword.

351
00:35:00,690 --> 00:35:04,390
Until you successfully take over,

352
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:06,480
I have to keep a watch.

353
00:35:10,530 --> 00:35:15,010
To win, you can't make any unnecessary actions.

354
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:19,690
I will remember.

355
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:49,640
MC Group's best fighter's favorite coffee.

356
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:52,200
You're very hard-working from so early in the morning.

357
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:55,800
If you think about it, I've never once in my life

358
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:58,820
not been hard-working.

359
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:04,670
Unfortunately, no one knew that. Other than you.

360
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:11,750
But Director Han, how was Wan Joon's expression when he saw my shares?

361
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:18,720
I should have seen that in person. What a big shame.

362
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:21,110
Whenever it works for you, stop by the office.

363
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:23,920
Okay!

364
00:36:27,130 --> 00:36:28,900
You're good a whistling.

365
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:31,250
You think that's the only thing I'm good at?

366
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:37,280
I'm good at more things than you think. Work hard, Director Han.

367
00:36:47,210 --> 00:36:49,370
Mo Wan Joon!

368
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:59,650
- Don't you have anything to say to me? 
 - Like what?

369
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:02,640
You may be the successor,

370
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:06,880
but you won't be able to do whatever you wish in the future. Why?

371
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:12,670
Because with just my shares, I can wipe you out.

372
00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:15,480
With just 10%? What are you saying?

373
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,900
I mean, you want to make some kind suggestions or something?

374
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:21,000
10%?

375
00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:27,250
Isn't that the most you could get by begging?

376
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:29,730
That's your current position.

377
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:32,000
Don't try anything foolish and just finish out your movie.

378
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,340
Cannes is not even a possibility but if you want to have a proper opening, that is.

379
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:54,960
But you know, life is long and the possibilities are endless.

380
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:59,650
You never know, I could get a prize at Cannes and

381
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:02,860
get up to a position way higher, don't you think?

382
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:06,120
You failed at the restaurant business, and Ironman triathlon,

383
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:09,720
and golfer you gave up in the middle. Now a movie director.

384
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:13,030
I mean, what have you ever done properly?

385
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:17,470
As I thought, you're lacking years of experience.

386
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:23,900
A hasty conclusion and judgment starts from understanding something about a human being.

387
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:27,150
Someone who has dignity

388
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:32,430
wants to prove himself more the more they get disregarded.

389
00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:37,400
Hey Mo Wan Joon.  Don't say.  Is this what you want?

390
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:45,690
So, have you taken an interest in the company now?

391
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:49,520
If so, you should have tried harder earlier.

392
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:54,090
I've had to live two lives since I was five, including yours.

393
00:38:54,090 --> 00:38:56,210
When you were lost while trying this and that,

394
00:38:56,210 --> 00:39:00,650
my responsibility in this family got bigger and bigger.

395
00:39:01,410 --> 00:39:07,100
I really couldn't do anything I wanted to do.

396
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:09,050
Is that so?

397
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:17,110
But being lost for artists, it's inevitable.

398
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:18,980
Sorry about that.

399
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:23,750
You don't know your place in this family and now covet the company?

400
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:28,420
Just stop cleanly by only messing up your own life.

401
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:31,150
Don't be clingy and being annoying.

402
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:33,730
Go ahead and do your business.

403
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,360
Yes.

404
00:40:47,370 --> 00:40:50,460
 MC Tower 

405
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:53,690
Let's check the status of the family's giving up their shares.

406
00:40:53,690 --> 00:40:56,870
Madam Ha Yeong Seo and Choi Na Ri is done.

407
00:40:56,870 --> 00:41:00,040
- How about the Miss? 
 - I'll confirm and finish it off by end of today.

408
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:03,320
Now Mo Wan Soo and Back Soo Jin are left.

409
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:04,960
I'll take care of the eldest.

410
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:07,610
- How about Baek Soo Jin? 
 - It's going as expected.

411
00:41:07,610 --> 00:41:10,940
- Who is it? Let's see his face.
 - Yes.

412
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:18,420
He went abroad to study music in Italy and changed his major to cooking.

413
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:21,360
They have music in common which seems to have drawn the lady's attention.

414
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:24,200
Good. And how far have they gone?

415
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,950
Take a look.

416
00:41:29,130 --> 00:41:30,620
Like this.

417
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:32,200
More power on your wrist.

418
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:34,120
Here.

419
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:36,360
Like this.

420
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:43,480
That's romantic.

421
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:48,840
Hold on. Do you think TOP can control their emotions too?

422
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:51,420
Human beings are pretty conventional animals.

423
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:56,860
When their interest and characteristics match 45%, the chemistry is the best.

424
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:59,300
Fate is made, too, actively.

425
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:05,030
And adultery is planned, too... Do chaebol families plan out their marriages, too?

426
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:09,100
Were you imagining the love story out of dramas?

427
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:11,830
No, it's not that but ...

428
00:42:11,830 --> 00:42:14,470
There are never coincidences when it comes to chaebol families' romance.

429
00:42:14,470 --> 00:42:15,660
But there is romance?

430
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:19,150
Deal with romance only inside your own heart.

431
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:39,460
Yes, I found it!

432
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:40,830
I found it!

433
00:42:40,830 --> 00:42:42,860
Let me see!

434
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:46,260
It's a photo I got from Eun Ji, Lawyer Heo's friend. And look here.

435
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:50,080
This is an old social media site that was popular back then.  And it's a photo that's on my friend's page.

436
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:52,240
Look here. It's from 15 years ago.

437
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:56,650
This is Park Tae Ho, and the kid that looks the same is Heo Yoon Do.

438
00:42:56,650 --> 00:42:58,910
Unless they're twins, it's the same person.

439
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:02,500
So Tae Ho's mom killed someone?

440
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:04,580
Yes. There was a rumor like that back then.

441
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:08,170
Wait, if Im Soon's son is Park Tae Ho, and Park Tae Ho is Heo Yoon Do...

442
00:43:08,170 --> 00:43:10,190
- Then Heo Yoon Do is Park Tae Ho? 
 - Yes.

443
00:43:10,190 --> 00:43:11,640
What is it that we need now?

444
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:13,760
Proof that Im Soon's son is Park Tae Ho.

445
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:15,180
I'm so proud of you.

446
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:20,620
Go. If we just dig this up, we'll soar through the sky like an eagle.

447
00:43:20,620 --> 00:43:22,310
Chief.

448
00:43:23,450 --> 00:43:24,830
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

449
00:43:24,830 --> 00:43:28,200
This crazy beautiful thing, let's get this!

450
00:43:38,890 --> 00:43:41,580
You have to sign now.

451
00:43:45,330 --> 00:43:48,580
  Mo Seok Hui 

452
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:52,160
Are you really okay?

453
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:56,000
I told you since the beginning that my goal wasn't money or the company.

454
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:02,400
It's not an easy decision even for those with money. You live without regret, so you're different.

455
00:44:03,670 --> 00:44:06,110
Do you still think Ha Yeong Seo is the culprit?

456
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:08,540
She's the most likely so far.

457
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:11,250
How is she with Choi Na Ri?

458
00:44:11,250 --> 00:44:16,420
Her blood is slowly drying up. It's so satisfying.

459
00:44:17,190 --> 00:44:20,900
What's the plan at TOP to get rid of the eldest or Baek Soo Jin?

460
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:24,380
Well, that is... It's not yet...

461
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:28,880
You, don't forget we're on the same team.

462
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:31,960
Anyway, for now, Dr. Seol's testimony

463
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:36,830
and the fact that Director Han called my mom to the site of the murder on the day of the incident,

464
00:44:36,830 --> 00:44:39,230
with just these, a retrial isn't possible.

465
00:44:39,230 --> 00:44:42,750
We need to get our hands on the incident report urgently.

466
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:48,750
Director Han must have the files just in case.

467
00:44:48,750 --> 00:44:50,590
Where could she be keeping it?

468
00:44:50,590 --> 00:44:54,260
Somewhere where no one can reach?

469
00:44:54,260 --> 00:44:57,510
- Her office? 
 - Office?

470
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:02,870
Since it's an open space for the employees, she's bet on the fact that no one would suspect it?

471
00:45:02,870 --> 00:45:07,290
So far, I haven't seen anyone entering without Director Han.

472
00:45:07,290 --> 00:45:09,730
Amusing.

473
00:45:09,730 --> 00:45:13,740
In the end, you'll have to go in there alone for the very first time.

474
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:15,000
Will I be able to?

475
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,430
It depends on your ability.

476
00:45:20,550 --> 00:45:26,570
We never know, so shouldn't we think of an alternative to her office?

477
00:45:26,570 --> 00:45:29,130
- Like? 
 - Well.

478
00:45:29,130 --> 00:45:34,220
I'll call Detective Oh and ask him to look into her.

479
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:39,140
I have to go now. Sadly.

480
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:41,620
- I'm happy, though. 
 - Of course you are.

481
00:45:41,620 --> 00:45:43,380
I'm leaving.

482
00:45:49,210 --> 00:45:52,380
Look into Han Jae Gook? Why her?

483
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:56,910
I have to find out where she's keeping the murder incident files she's taken.

484
00:45:56,910 --> 00:46:00,390
Chaebols usually hide them in their vacation homes or in the basement of their house.

485
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:01,440
Right?

486
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:07,280
Director Han's salary is astronomical. If she's started buying a vacation home, I'm sure she's bought several by now.

487
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:11,940
I got it. I'll look into any vacation homes she might own or

488
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:13,650
where she could hide it.

489
00:46:13,650 --> 00:46:15,390
Okay. Please.

490
00:46:15,390 --> 00:46:19,430
What do you mean please? That makes me disappointed. We're on the same team now.

491
00:46:20,370 --> 00:46:24,320
Oh, I see. I thought you just had one leg over the line. But we're really doing this together?

492
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:31,420
Of course. I do tend to be careful usually, but once I commit, I give my all without a care for myself.

493
00:46:43,650 --> 00:46:46,860
I really like this room.

494
00:46:46,860 --> 00:46:50,990
Something just feels great in here.

495
00:46:50,990 --> 00:46:53,650
Did you drink?

496
00:46:53,650 --> 00:46:55,680
A little bit?

497
00:47:00,970 --> 00:47:04,910
Weren't you the type to hold up the end of your bargain?

498
00:47:04,910 --> 00:47:07,630
Why is it different than you promised?

499
00:47:07,630 --> 00:47:12,190
Asking for 30% right now is asking for a war.

500
00:47:12,190 --> 00:47:14,490
Do you have the confidence to win the war?

501
00:47:14,490 --> 00:47:18,760
You want to dissolve the promise we made?

502
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:23,760
Weren't you capable of protecting my shares without a war?

503
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:29,330
That's why I trusted you. The way I see it,

504
00:47:29,330 --> 00:47:33,010
this seems like a problem of sincerity.

505
00:47:33,010 --> 00:47:38,230
You're still young. You can take one step at a time.

506
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:41,430
While trusting you who doesn't keep her promise?

507
00:47:41,430 --> 00:47:43,340
Then whom will you choose?

508
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:48,180
I don't have anyone else...

509
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:52,660
I'm alone...

510
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:59,710
But... you don't seem as capable as before.

511
00:48:01,190 --> 00:48:07,520
Since you reneged on the promise, is it my turn?

512
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:12,100
I'm a humanitarian, so I don't really want to.

513
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:16,160
Did you already know Choi Na Ri from before?

514
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:18,190
Why talk about Seo Jin's mom all of a sudden?

515
00:48:18,190 --> 00:48:22,460
When she came unexpectedly, you seemed to be shaken.

516
00:48:22,460 --> 00:48:24,460
Me?

517
00:48:27,150 --> 00:48:29,510
Was I?

518
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:36,560
Look here, Director Han,

519
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:41,460
who would anyone in the world be glad to see a stepmom who's younger than himself?

520
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:47,500
Also, I'm more sensitive and conservative when it comes to these types of issues than I look.

521
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:50,510
- Is that so? 
 - Anyway.

522
00:48:51,390 --> 00:48:56,460
Now, I only have one condition.

523
00:48:56,460 --> 00:49:00,120
Get my shares up ASAP.

524
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:04,590
If not, I'll reveal that the press conference was all fake.

525
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:11,610
I'll trust in you just once more then.

526
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:55,590
A fun story could come out of this...

527
00:49:58,170 --> 00:49:59,550
Lawyer Heo?

528
00:49:59,550 --> 00:50:02,230
Yes, I'll be right up.

529
00:50:15,470 --> 00:50:18,350
- What does that look mean?
 - Pardon?

530
00:50:18,350 --> 00:50:23,760
Whenever something urgent came up, it was your job. But Lawyer Heo keeps being called.

531
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:26,200
So are you jealous?

532
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:30,150
You're wrong about that. It's ridiculous.

533
00:50:31,270 --> 00:50:33,490
It is, right?

534
00:50:51,490 --> 00:50:54,040
- You worked hard. 
 - Yes.

535
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:57,160
Things are smooth with Miss since you're in charge of her.

536
00:50:57,160 --> 00:50:59,660
Is that so? I'll take that as a compliment.

537
00:50:59,660 --> 00:51:02,130
But there's one more thing you need to do.

538
00:51:02,130 --> 00:51:03,350
Yes. What is...

539
00:51:03,350 --> 00:51:05,820
- About Choi Na Ri. 
 - Pardon?

540
00:51:05,820 --> 00:51:09,660
See if there are any connections to Mo Wan Joon quietly.

541
00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:10,990
By connections, you mean...

542
00:51:10,990 --> 00:51:14,880
I'm not sure. It could be many things.

543
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:16,900
I understand.

544
00:51:32,310 --> 00:51:35,550
 In the mood for a restaurant after a long time 

545
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:40,730
 You must protect your eyes 

546
00:51:43,050 --> 00:51:45,760
   
  Comebycoffee_m: You don't even eat soup and rice. ]  

547
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:50,340
 Reading is nourishment for the mind. 

548
00:51:51,180 --> 00:51:54,280
 Comebycoffee_m 

549
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:08,840
Choi Na Ri was boasting that you were her best friend on Oustagram.

550
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:11,050
You believe that?

551
00:52:11,050 --> 00:52:16,940
"I have a non-famous friend of many years, so I'm a nice celebrity."

552
00:52:16,940 --> 00:52:19,160
Wouldn't that be her motive?

553
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:24,070
The child was said to be the eldest of MC Group's kid.

554
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:27,440
It's a lie.

555
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:30,360
He's just a sacrifice.

556
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:31,420
Really?

557
00:52:31,420 --> 00:52:36,250
But then again, she did date Wan Soo Oppa first.

558
00:52:39,810 --> 00:52:43,800
Anyway, I don't keep in contact with her now. Happy?

559
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:47,020
Also, I don't have the luxury of chitchatting like this.

560
00:52:47,020 --> 00:52:49,870
It's hard enough for me to pay my rent.

561
00:52:49,870 --> 00:52:52,360
I'll excuse myself.

562
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:54,010
Yes.

563
00:53:01,340 --> 00:53:04,980
  Mo Wan Soo  

564
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:12,480
- Choi Na Ri's autograph? 
 - Yes.

565
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:15,610
That's why you called?

566
00:53:15,610 --> 00:53:18,700
You're a funny person.

567
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:22,340
To be honest, my father is a huge fan.

568
00:53:22,340 --> 00:53:25,910
You're close to Seok Hui. Why not ask her?

569
00:53:25,910 --> 00:53:30,830
You know her temper! She'll make fun of me saying I'm cheesy.

570
00:53:30,830 --> 00:53:35,320
Yeah, she is a little harsh.

571
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:40,000
As expected, I'm the only one you can make small requests to, right?

572
00:53:40,860 --> 00:53:47,280
I have the ability to disarm people like this, since I'm a humanitarian.

573
00:53:48,370 --> 00:53:52,290
But since it's your request, so...

574
00:53:52,290 --> 00:53:54,540
What is bothering you?

575
00:53:54,540 --> 00:53:58,020
- She came in as a stepmom! Why wouldn't it bother me? 
  - I see.

576
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:06,180
But... what is TOP planning to throw Choi Na Ri out of the house?

577
00:54:06,180 --> 00:54:10,560
Well, nothing much has been planned at the moment.

578
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:17,760
If you hear from Director Han, tell me a little about it.

579
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:22,150
Of course. You're even going to get me her autograph.

580
00:54:22,150 --> 00:54:28,990
But isn't she an actress you would covet as a director?

581
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:32,710
She's not bad.

582
00:54:32,710 --> 00:54:36,070
Sadly, there wasn't an opportunity.

583
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:41,700
So you met her for the first time when she came to the house?

584
00:54:44,470 --> 00:54:47,640
Of course it is.

585
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:52,360
It's not possible to meet with all the actors just because I'm a director.

586
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:09,130
Congratulations on your wedding anniversary.

587
00:55:09,130 --> 00:55:12,570
Thanks, how much left before the Chairman arrives?

588
00:55:12,570 --> 00:55:14,440
He will be here in 5 minutes.

589
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:16,970
Yes? Okay,

590
00:55:16,970 --> 00:55:19,110
you can go now.

591
00:55:19,110 --> 00:55:22,580
- Have a good time. 
- Okay.

592
00:55:26,790 --> 00:55:29,790
Oh right! Music!

593
00:55:33,350 --> 00:55:34,820
What's this?

594
00:55:34,820 --> 00:55:38,180
Take those dinner plates away.

595
00:55:38,180 --> 00:55:42,390
And change the lighting since it doesn’t suit the overall concept.

596
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:50,080
And the colors of these chairs… It really brings down my level.

597
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:52,560
Hurry up and throw those away.

598
00:55:53,810 --> 00:55:59,370
What's with tnat response?  Didn't you hear me?

599
00:55:59,370 --> 00:56:05,020
I'm supposed to do only what the madame tells me to do.

600
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:08,590
Ma-madame?

601
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:12,360
Then, who am I?

602
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:16,540
I asked who am I then!

603
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:18,550
You all may leave.

604
00:56:33,010 --> 00:56:35,400
What do you think you're doing right now?

605
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:38,800
Do I have to say it for you to understand?

606
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:43,590
So you want to attempt at becoming the Madame of MC group?

607
00:56:43,590 --> 00:56:45,670
There’s no reason I couldn’t.

608
00:56:45,670 --> 00:56:50,160
You, who have no talent or ability becoming a top star

609
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:52,660
was only due to the chairman.

610
00:56:52,660 --> 00:56:58,840
But you dare, without knowing your place, in order to take over the household

611
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:04,520
you even invade this house like some alley cat?

612
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:11,580
See? If you hadn’t messed with me in the first place this wouldn’t have happened.

613
00:57:11,580 --> 00:57:16,460
I've lost everything. So, I have nothing to fear.

614
00:57:16,460 --> 00:57:20,840
Even if you lose everything you have, it’s still not enough for me.

615
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:25,430
Do you know what the difference is between you and me?

616
00:57:25,430 --> 00:57:30,300
You’re old... and I’m young?

617
00:57:30,300 --> 00:57:36,180
There's one more thing. I can still get pregnant.

618
00:57:40,550 --> 00:57:45,240
I’ve experienced this once before a long time ago.

619
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:51,290
There were people who dared to try to drive me, who gave birth to the first born, out of the Mo family home.

620
00:57:51,290 --> 00:57:55,610
I trampled on them and came all the way here.

621
00:57:56,430 --> 00:58:01,820
That story means that you can't do anything either.

622
00:58:02,830 --> 00:58:07,460
Are you trying to say that you could kill me?

623
00:58:07,460 --> 00:58:11,320
Do you know why death is scary?

624
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:16,620
It is because no one knows when and how it'll come to them.

625
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:30,010
OMG.  A dung fly landed.

626
00:58:31,180 --> 00:58:35,050
I'm going to have disinfect the house.

627
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:44,620
Why am I feeling merciful now?

628
00:58:57,610 --> 00:59:03,240
Do you remember? What you did to my mom.

629
00:59:06,410 --> 00:59:10,150
 You were kicked out because you didn't even carry out your duty as a woman. 

630
00:59:10,150 --> 00:59:14,810
 Do you think you can come back again just because you had a baby girl? 

631
00:59:14,810 --> 00:59:17,780
 Speak to me at the proper level. 

632
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:23,900
 What? Level? Are you going to talk about level? 

633
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:27,290
 The Chairman threw you away from when you were young. 

634
00:59:27,290 --> 00:59:33,710
 Don't you understand that means  both as a woman and your life is finished? 

635
00:59:35,860 --> 00:59:39,920
 Get ready to move and take with you 

636
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:42,430
 your filthy thoughts of waiting for and  living  to that man. 

637
00:59:42,430 --> 00:59:44,200
 I'm not done talking! 

638
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:45,260
 Let go of me! 

639
00:59:45,260 --> 00:59:47,720
 You won't be able to able to come into this house as long as you are alive. 

640
00:59:47,720 --> 00:59:52,360
 What? This ... Really 

641
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:57,770
 Are you crazy? 

642
00:59:57,770 --> 01:00:01,640
 Yes, I've gone mad, I'm crazy, I said I'm crazy!! 

643
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:03,750
 Stop it!! 

644
01:00:09,250 --> 01:00:15,800
 As a refined person, why can't you maintain your equilibrium and not get all wound up ... 

645
01:00:34,690 --> 01:00:41,120
You were always anxious thinking my mom would come back into the house.

646
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:45,460
So I've been thinking

647
01:00:45,460 --> 01:00:52,790
that's why you would've done something to my mom.

648
01:00:52,790 --> 01:00:55,490
The heaven would know.

649
01:00:55,490 --> 01:00:58,310
I would also come to know soon.

650
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:32,700
Is this fun?

651
01:01:34,320 --> 01:01:39,640
Please behave yourself at home.

652
01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:43,100
So, ruining my life wasn't enough?

653
01:01:44,420 --> 01:01:47,610
Who is ruining who's life?

654
01:01:47,610 --> 01:01:53,020
Right, it hasn't ended yet.

655
01:01:53,020 --> 01:01:55,030
Be careful of what you say.

656
01:01:55,030 --> 01:01:58,710
If I tell about you, we both are done for.

657
01:01:58,710 --> 01:02:00,540
Did you know?

658
01:02:04,090 --> 01:02:06,430
Get a grip.

659
01:02:35,180 --> 01:02:36,990
Have a seat.

660
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:43,880
I think what you are suspecting is correct.

661
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:47,890
Really? What kind of interesting story am I looking forward to?

662
01:02:47,890 --> 01:02:51,470
I searched Instagram.  According to one of her friends, Choi Na Ri  and Mo Wan Soo

663
01:02:51,470 --> 01:02:54,300
were "friends" and knew each other since college.

664
01:02:56,700 --> 01:02:57,870
What kind of relationship?

665
01:02:57,870 --> 01:03:00,010
Well, I'm not sure of anything yet.

666
01:03:00,010 --> 01:03:02,690
- Who else knows about this? - No one else.

667
01:03:02,690 --> 01:03:07,830
Maintain tight security and see the Choi Na Ri's friend again for more evidence.

668
01:03:07,830 --> 01:03:09,800
I got it.

669
01:03:14,930 --> 01:03:17,400
- Madam. 
 - What?

670
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:20,500
Must we really go this far for Choi Na Ri?

671
01:03:20,560 --> 01:03:22,740
What's the reason not to?

672
01:03:22,740 --> 01:03:25,880
Why? Because your dad is her fan?

673
01:03:25,880 --> 01:03:29,960
What's the difference between us and a private detective?

674
01:03:30,820 --> 01:03:36,290
How many dirty hands do you think one person must shake in order to succeed?

675
01:03:39,180 --> 01:03:42,660
In order to maintain MC Group  ... one thing is certain ...

676
01:03:42,660 --> 01:03:47,060
no matter what we do, nothing  goes too far.

677
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:10,160
 In order to maintain MC group, 

678
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:14,560
 no matter what we do, nothing  goes too far. 

679
01:04:29,890 --> 01:04:33,290
Just...a little something for you.

680
01:04:38,220 --> 01:04:43,550
Would there be any proof Choi Nari was close to Mo Wan Soo?

681
01:04:43,550 --> 01:04:49,830
I..have  video footage of us hanging out together a while ago.

682
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:33,420
Nothing? What does that mean?

683
01:05:33,420 --> 01:05:35,890
Those two are not in a special relationship,

684
01:05:35,890 --> 01:05:39,030
they just know each other.

685
01:05:42,740 --> 01:05:45,220
Do you still  not have the determined mindset on your work

686
01:05:45,220 --> 01:05:47,550
or did you really not find anything?

687
01:05:47,550 --> 01:05:49,020
Sorry about that.

688
01:05:49,020 --> 01:05:51,400
You did your best? Yes.

689
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:57,380
I did my best but the conclusion is that the two are not in a special relationship.

690
01:05:59,240 --> 01:06:02,420
Fine, go.

691
01:06:49,080 --> 01:06:52,020
- Look at Choi Na Ri's Instagram and find her college friends. 
 - What?

692
01:06:52,020 --> 01:06:56,920
Find and come up with the proof of the relationship between Choi Dal Hee and Mo Wan Soo.

693
01:06:56,920 --> 01:06:59,200
The two had a relationship?

694
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:02,200
Had my prediction ever been wrong?

695
01:07:03,620 --> 01:07:06,830
Lawyer Heo didn't do a good job.

696
01:07:06,830 --> 01:07:09,540
He didn't? Yes.

697
01:07:09,540 --> 01:07:11,010
Are you not confident?

698
01:07:11,010 --> 01:07:14,070
No no. I'll figure it out.

699
01:07:28,180 --> 01:07:31,400
Mrs. Han approves of the reconstruction of the separate building.

700
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:34,660
Oh really? That's great.

701
01:07:34,660 --> 01:07:41,020
I know I said I'll take care of the interior, but can't TOP manage that too?

702
01:07:42,210 --> 01:07:44,720
You have a great sense, Manager Lee.

703
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:47,280
I'll need to see for the approval from Mrs. Han again.

704
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:50,240
Ok, say some good words.

705
01:07:52,900 --> 01:07:57,500
Honestly, I like Manager Lee better than Mrs. Han's style.

706
01:07:57,500 --> 01:08:00,620
We're a good match.

707
01:08:00,620 --> 01:08:04,090
We'll see each other for a long time in the future.

708
01:08:04,090 --> 01:08:05,790
Right!

709
01:08:07,720 --> 01:08:11,000
How come there's no customer here, the place looks so nice.

710
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:15,130
They don't take any other customers when serving VIPs.

711
01:08:15,130 --> 01:08:19,460
Oh, look at you working so hard!

712
01:08:19,460 --> 01:08:22,590
You are completely my style!

713
01:08:22,590 --> 01:08:25,420
Is food good here too? Of course.

714
01:08:25,420 --> 01:08:28,070
Then should we have dinner?

715
01:08:28,070 --> 01:08:30,340
Great, let me use the restroom first.

716
01:08:30,340 --> 01:08:31,380
Ok.

717
01:08:31,380 --> 01:08:35,360
I'll take a look at the menu.

718
01:08:57,700 --> 01:09:00,150
Let's do this.

719
01:09:17,370 --> 01:09:19,360
Oppa.

720
01:09:26,930 --> 01:09:30,080
What is it? Why are you here?

721
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:31,940
I'm here with Manager Lee Gyeong Hwa.

722
01:09:31,940 --> 01:09:37,440
Manager Lee? I'm here to see Mrs. Han.

723
01:09:41,880 --> 01:09:43,600
Go go!

724
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:47,420
If our relationship gets caught, we are dead meat.

725
01:09:47,420 --> 01:09:52,830
It's just you and I here, how can I pretend I didn't see you?

726
01:09:52,830 --> 01:09:55,840
If we sit separately, that's your own goal.

727
01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:58,820
What are you talking about?

728
01:09:58,820 --> 01:10:05,820
There's no retreat route.  It's also an ability to be able to acknowledge that.

729
01:10:05,820 --> 01:10:09,970
Sometimes the luck might come up and  misfortune will step back.

730
01:10:09,970 --> 01:10:14,720
For now, be natural like a step mom. You are an actor.

731
01:10:39,460 --> 01:10:41,600
Mrs. Han.

732
01:10:45,210 --> 01:10:49,170
Mrs. Han! TOP team must love this place.

733
01:10:49,170 --> 01:10:54,370
Mrs. Han and Manager Lee, we had a separate appointment but we are all here!

734
01:10:54,370 --> 01:10:57,880
I met the first son here too!

735
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:03,850
Then let's move to the other table?

736
01:11:03,850 --> 01:11:07,560
No, let's sit here.

737
01:11:41,910 --> 01:11:46,040
CEO doesn't know yet about your relationship.

738
01:11:48,070 --> 01:11:51,430
Leave the country as soon as possible.

739
01:11:51,430 --> 01:11:54,640
Say no more about 30% shares of the company.

740
01:11:57,770 --> 01:12:03,190
I won't report to the CEO, sorry about the bad news.

741
01:12:03,190 --> 01:12:05,690
Mrs. Han, nice shot!

742
01:12:05,690 --> 01:12:09,850
One shot two kill.

743
01:12:09,850 --> 01:12:11,550
Great job.

744
01:12:11,550 --> 01:12:15,420
You are still great.

745
01:12:15,420 --> 01:12:19,740
I still have so much to learn from you.

746
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:22,820
Good work.

747
01:12:54,470 --> 01:12:56,390
What?

748
01:12:57,940 --> 01:13:05,150
Stop look at me as dirty, pathetic and dumbfounded.

749
01:13:07,820 --> 01:13:14,580
I only had the face in my 20s,

750
01:13:14,580 --> 01:13:18,220
there was no way to be successful.

751
01:13:18,220 --> 01:13:21,420
You don't know because you were born with a diamond spoon.

752
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:29,340
Right, I wanted to be rich and successful.

753
01:13:29,340 --> 01:13:34,010
So because of Wan Soo, I chose the CEO.

754
01:13:36,380 --> 01:13:40,760
Criticize me, I'll take it as much.

755
01:13:40,760 --> 01:13:47,590
But because you had nothing to eat

756
01:13:47,590 --> 01:13:51,120
if you haven't starved for 4 days,

757
01:13:52,200 --> 01:13:57,410
then in front of me,  keep your mouth shut

758
01:13:58,390 --> 01:14:00,900
and don't breathe a word.

759
01:14:21,300 --> 01:14:23,220
What's up?

760
01:14:24,150 --> 01:14:26,990
Did you do a secret investigation on Choi Na Ri?

761
01:14:28,740 --> 01:14:31,720
Yes, I did.

762
01:14:31,720 --> 01:14:36,950
Right. Why did you not tell me?

763
01:14:36,950 --> 01:14:40,350
I mean...that's.

764
01:14:43,960 --> 01:14:45,560
I can explain, in fact

765
01:14:45,560 --> 01:14:48,030
How was it like to find out others' personal life?

766
01:14:48,030 --> 01:14:53,410
What? I wished you would find your place in TOP more than anyone else.

767
01:14:53,410 --> 01:14:57,380
But I'm scared because your soul even becomes like TOP.

768
01:14:57,380 --> 01:15:00,980
Weren't you feeling anything when doing a secret investigation? Didn't it bother you

769
01:15:00,980 --> 01:15:04,320
Or you didn't tell me because you were completely fine?

770
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:11,440
If I were you, ... I would have acted differently.

771
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:13,870
I know, listen to me.

772
01:15:13,870 --> 01:15:16,580
I was almost there!

773
01:15:19,260 --> 01:15:21,720
You ruined everything.

774
01:15:24,590 --> 01:15:28,920
Ha Young Seo, finally she lost her nerve and control.

775
01:15:28,920 --> 01:15:32,610
She's starting to crumble gradually so that she isn't wrapped in hypocrisy any more.

776
01:15:32,610 --> 01:15:34,610
But!!

777
01:15:46,550 --> 01:15:49,430
Are we on the same team?

778
01:15:57,450 --> 01:15:59,560
Mo Seok Hui!!!

779
01:15:59,560 --> 01:16:05,320

 Let's put an end to the love interest today.

01:16:33,290 --> 01:16:34,980
 How much do you know about Wan Joon? 

787
01:16:34,980 --> 01:16:37,810
 If you get too greedy, I won't stand for it. 

788
01:16:37,810 --> 01:16:39,170
 Where are you placing your bet? 

789
01:16:39,170 --> 01:16:40,980
 I'm going to bet on you. 

790
01:16:40,980 --> 01:16:42,240
 Chief! Chief! 

791
01:16:42,240 --> 01:16:43,830
 It's correct that Park Tae Ho is Im Soon's son. Look here ... 

792
01:16:43,830 --> 01:16:46,370
 - Hello? 
 - Mr. Park Tae Ho? 

793
01:16:46,370 --> 01:16:49,620
 You're a family disgrace. 

794
01:16:49,620 --> 01:16:52,680
 Mo Wan Joon, you don't deserve to be a husband. 

795
01:16:52,680 --> 01:16:53,450
 Theres is something strange. 

796
01:16:53,450 --> 01:16:59,360
 If we can identify Wan Joon's weaknesses, we can use it as a card to move Ha Yeong Seo.
