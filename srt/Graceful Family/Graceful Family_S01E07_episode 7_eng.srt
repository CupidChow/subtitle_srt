 Graceful  Family 

6
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:33,630
 When I told you to take a period of retrenchment on the construction and 

7
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:36,980
 invest in new techniques, what did you tell me? 

8
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:41,900
 You said you were confident and scraped up the money from all over the place but with recession and series of issues, 

9
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:45,050
 in the end, you spent even the foreign investments 

10
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:47,120
 and the affiliate construction fell into others' hands. 

11
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:52,040
 There was a great ambush that no one could have predicted in the form of the IMF crisis. 

12
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,870
 Rather than a misjudgment on my part-- 

13
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:57,360
 If the general faults his soldiers, that war has already been lost! 

14
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,990
 Father! 

15
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:05,790
 Two companies in which you were responsible to make the executive decisions have already been lost. 

16
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:13,070
 I don't think of you as my son. 

17
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:18,040
 I only look at the results as a business man.  

18
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:20,960
  You may leave. 

19
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:31,330
 The son lost his father's faith, 

20
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,130
 and the son earned his father's disappointment. 

21
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:46,950


22
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:55,230
 Seok Hui... you're MC's future.  

23
00:01:56,620 --> 00:02:00,660
 The desire of a father who dreamed an unconventional alternative  ... 

24
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 and the desire of the son who could never give up the highest position, 

25
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:30,020
 in this colossal castle, a various ambitions are stirring from one generation to the next. 

26
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:58,390
 The husband, in order to become the heir to MC Group, 

27
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:01,610
 has to sustain a meaningless marriage, 

28
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:15,130
 and the wife, in order to have true freedom and love in the future  

29
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:18,010
 endures it in her own way. 

30
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,300
 The mom tries to rule MC Group through her son, 

31
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:37,370
Honey.

32
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:41,380
How long must I live while hiding out?

33
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:46,370
 And someone else tries to use the Chairman's love in order to gain something bigger. 

34
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:06,040
No. Jung Sook was really with Bu Cheol last night.

35
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,280
She was with Bu Cheol.

36
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:13,930
 And through which method will the artist who's armed himself with creativity fulfill his desire?  

37
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:22,660
 Everyone has the freedom to have a desire, 

38
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:26,390
 but the future of the family is in their hands, 

39
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:41,580
 and their future is, in the end, created by TOP.

   Episode 7  

41
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:57,290
 As long as MC Group is in my hands, it doesn't matter if grandfather dies or not. 

42
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:59,890
 He's already old. 

43
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:02,970
Sign it.

44
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:10,270
Fine.

45
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,110
I will

46
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:16,240
sign.

47
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:28,790

49
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:38,920

♫ I never go there  ♫

♫  The paradise of just the two of us  ♫

59
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:12,270
So you lost your management rights and your inheritance, too?

60
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:16,720
Yeah. And I can't have you as my personal attorney anymore.

61
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,920
Why?

62
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,500
Because Director Han likes you.

63
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:27,660
I know. There's no way I can control my popularity...

64
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:32,680
Are you that happy? You're so simple.

65
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:35,910
Shouldn't we supplement the minerals in your brain?

66
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:40,660
I am envious of your titanium mentality that can laugh at a time like this.

67
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:42,360
So what are you going to do in the future?

68
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,370
You do what you want.

69
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,500
- What do you mean? 
 - Become a big shot at TOP.

70
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:54,210
If you're with Director Han, you should be able to get your hands on all the files of the murder case.

71
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:58,450
You have to prove your mom's innocence.

72
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:03,250
Wait a minute. Are you saying you're going to give up?

73
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,520
What can I do right now?

74
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:10,560
Hey, Mo Seok Hui, I came this far because you were with me.

75
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:15,230
Without you, it's impossible for me, too.

76
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:21,290
Then... can you become a member of TOP down deep into your bones?

77
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:24,210
If I can prove my mom's innocence, I can do anything.

78
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:27,340
No, I will do it.

79
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,420
But in turn, you make a promise, too.

80
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:37,590
How should an heiress live when everything's been taken away from her?

81
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:41,660
The only hobby I have... is spending money?

82
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,100
Biting remarks and verbal abuse is just the basic.

83
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,600
Abusing my power... is an option?

84
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:53,400
Become a crazy Mo Seok Hui?

85
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:02,130
Hey, hey, what are you doing right now?

86
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:05,570
Here.

87
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,310
Take it.

88
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:13,990
What is this?

89
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:15,990
What could it be?

90
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:23,130
Don't be too nervous. I'm leaving.

91
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:45,300
 Let me ask one thing. 

92
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:49,980
 - Who killed Grandfather? 
 - Mo Seok Hui!  

93
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:53,250
 Tell me the truth. Then I'll sign it. 

94
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,500
 I took care of it.  

95
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,640
Mo Seok Hui...

96
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:09,940
Right... I'll go as far as I can.

97
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:34,180
Isn't the night sky beautiful?

98
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:41,480
I'll work for TOP.

99
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:54,360
Don't forget that you are no longer Miss' personal attorney but TOP's attorney.

100
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,360
Yes.

101
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,790
Aren't you sad? You must have become fond of each other.

102
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:02,170
Well, I'm a little sad but relieved.

103
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:05,400
Sad but relieved?

104
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:09,960
Then from now on, I only have to worry about the part where you're sad?

105
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:42,980
Now, shall we see if everyone has been well during the night?

106
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:44,160
Yes.

107
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:57,130
It's Miss' shopping history from yesterday.

108
00:12:57,130 --> 00:12:58,780
It's rather a large amount that was spent.

109
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:00,160
Shouldn't we give her a limit?

110
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,650
Let her be. Spending money is the only thing she enjoys.

111
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:05,770
- And her sister-in-law? 
 - Massage shop, club, eatery.

112
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:08,250
She's normal.

113
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:10,380
Young Master, Mo Han Soo, went over his card limit.

114
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:12,340
He also used his card to settle his film company debt.

115
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:14,750
- Let's block that one. 
 - Yes.

116
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:20,580
But Director Mo Wan Joon keeps spending more and more on women's attire in Cheongdamdong.

117
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:22,120
- There are also jewelry purchases. 
 - Watch it for now.

118
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,540
Watch it for now.

119
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:26,230
The Younger Madame has been getting one on one cooking lessons

120
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:28,980
from Renee Hotel's chef for Chinese, Japanese and even Italian food.

121
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:32,140
They're a trophy couple. If that's the only way they can bear with it, what can we do?

122
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:33,360
Have you resolved the issue with the prosecutors?

123
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,390
Yes, the charges for violation of Capital Market Act and coercion that Head Chairman's side made

124
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:38,420
have all been resolved as if it never happened.

125
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:39,200
What about the press?

126
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,620
Miss Mo Seok Hui gave up her management rights to her father,

127
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:44,330
and MC Group is now powerfully in control.

128
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:46,840
Articles like this would be released very often from now on.

129
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,940
Emphasize that there's no feud within the family.

130
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:50,940
Yes, Ma'am.

131
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,420
Good work.

132
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,090
Good work.

133
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:03,960
As of right now, Attorney Heo doesn't have any weaknesses that we can see.

134
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,170
Really?

135
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,070
Update the report on his personal details,

136
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:09,380
it will be good if we find something.

137
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:11,000
Yes, Ma'am.

138
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:15,960
 Mo Cheol Hui 

139
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,370
Yes, Chairman.

140
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:23,530
Isn't this place specially more beautiful?

141
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:26,270
The president especially liked this place.

142
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:30,390
If things went well just because I had a liking for something, business would be so easy.

143
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:33,390
Even though everyone opposed me, you supported me.

144
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,940
The more I think about it,

145
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:39,490
You're an impressive person.

146
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:41,380
You're too kind.

147
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:46,330
President Choi must have felt very empty.

148
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:49,930
He was your childhood friend. It must be hard since he passed away.

149
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:52,350
That guy made a mistake in business.

150
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:55,130
His kids are terrible and employing the wrong people...

151
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:57,630
How can he be so bad at reading people?

152
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:00,820
I hear Dong Hyeon Group was acquired by an English company.

153
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:07,240
Something like that must never happen to our MC Group.

154
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:11,620
Families in opposition and internal uprising or whatever, just thinking about it

155
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:13,260
It's horrible.

156
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:19,380
My Wan Joon dominating the group in a stable fashion,

157
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:21,850
I have to see it with my own eyes.

158
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:23,850
We're preparing step by step.

159
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:27,440
No, please hurry.

160
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,130
Mo Wan Joon's succession?

161
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:50,660
 Chairman, are you that afraid of me? 

162
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:06,960
You've never disobeyed me since you were a child.

163
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:10,730
Thank you for bearing with it so well.

164
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:16,380
I need to rest now.

165
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:17,860
Father...

166
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,060
Dong Hyeon Group's President Choi inherited

167
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:28,300
the subsidiaries around the same time as I did and and we both grew together,

168
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:31,780
but Dong Hyeon has now been bought out by the English.

169
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:36,890
Do you know the difference between him and me?

170
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:38,370
I'm not sure.

171
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:41,430
He didn't have Han Je Gook,

172
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:44,780
but I did.

173
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:48,630
Director Han, to think of her as someone without greed,

174
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:52,250
it's impossible to believe with the common sense of capitalism.

175
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:54,940
She's unique.

176
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:57,320
But a human is a living organism,

177
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,830
they can change whenever.

178
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:03,470
We can never allow Director Han or whomever to

179
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:05,240
shake our family by the roots.

180
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,590
Even if it's your mother.

181
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:11,760
I understand what you mean.

182
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:18,590
In my life, if there is anything that I achieved on my own,

183
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,830
that is solely you.

184
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:26,680
Father.

185
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:29,660
You'll follow after me,

186
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:32,150
and become the owner of MC Group.

187
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:58,200
 Incheon to Paris  

188
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:09,890
Now the only thing left are things that can burden you.

189
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:12,660
I know. You're right.

190
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:19,360
I believe you're in a sexless marriage.

191
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:22,640
Director Han.

192
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,750
This is about business.

193
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:29,920
We cannot allow anything to damage the group or to become a roadblock for the succession process.

194
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,860
It's sexless, correct?

195
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:33,670
Yes.

196
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:35,200
Since when?

197
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:40,490
I think about a year after the wedding.

198
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:42,900
Why aren't you getting a divorce then?

199
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:45,000
There's the group's image to consider,

200
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,610
and I want to avoid anything that might damage the group.

201
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:51,610
Please keep doing that.

202
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:05,180
When are you getting rid of the officetel?

203
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:14,900
What's that?

204
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,940
Director Mo Wan Joo has a woman.

205
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:18,900
Really? Connect it.

206
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,240
Yes, Ma'am.

207
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:26,730
 TOP
MC Group security agent 

208
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:32,330
It's already over and done with.

209
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:36,990
Please let me know if there's something I can do to help.

210
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:39,630
No, it's okay.

211
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:42,580
So it's been dealt with cleanly?

212
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:45,360
Yes, of course.

213
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,730
Did I ever give TOP a hard time with my personal life?

214
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,620
Don't worry about it.

215
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:59,300
- You should get a divorce. 
 - What?

216
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:01,670
If you get a divorce now, you'll only end up having to pay under 10 million in alimony,

217
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:03,970
but after the succession, it'll jump to 100 million.

218
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:06,640
If you dawdle, a financial loss is a certain

219
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,490
and your image will be ruined.

220
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:12,480
After the succession, the other party will file a lawsuit 100%,

221
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:18,160
the news hungry press will talk daily about whether or not you two slept together.

222
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:24,270
Please proceed with the divorce, right away.

223
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:35,150
It's a 10-year project for Director Mo's succession.

224
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:37,120
Is there a change in the Chairman's mind?

225
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:40,200
There will be many variables if we have to hurry a long-term project.

226
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,680
I thought there was nothing wrong with his health either.

227
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:48,360
Yes. It's his obsessive nature that he has to see the succession project complete safely.

228
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,690
Anyway, the possibility of it is?

229
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:53,020
The Chairman’s stocks and Miss’ stocks that are to be transferred,

230
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:55,190
it’s difficult for all of them to be bequeathed to Director Mo directly.

231
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:57,660
First of all, the gift tax is astronomical.

232
00:22:57,660 --> 00:23:00,930
On top of that, the gift tax was already paid on Miss' stocks,

233
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:02,130
so paying taxes on it again is a bit...

234
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:06,220
And for Director Mo,  his inheritance will be more than portion under statutory succession.

235
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:08,760
Wan Soo, the eldest, youngest, Seo Jin,

236
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,500
and Miss Seok Hui will take action right away.

237
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,260
Everyone will request sequestering of their portion of the statutory reserved share.

238
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:14,650
It could take years just to resolve litigation.

239
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:17,060
Just taking care of the family's reserved shares alone won't be easy,

240
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:20,390
and especially the youngest Seo Jin's mother, Choi Na Ri, is a ticking time bomb.

241
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:23,550
W- wait... Seo Jin's mom can't be...

242
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:25,260
You didn't know Choi Na Ri was the youngest's mom?

243
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:27,960
On top of that, recently, a member of the ruling party has initiated the revision

244
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:30,970
of the law of succession, so it's under the committee's review currently.

245
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:31,690
The contents?

246
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:34,770
It contains a provision to raise the inheritance tax rate  and acknowledging a claim from a significant other.

247
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:38,150
In this state, transfer of management rights to Director Mo is difficult.

248
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:39,630
Just taxes alone is several billion won.

249
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:42,320
But despite that, what do we have to do?

250
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,260
First, we have to obtain from the family documents relinquishing their legally reserved share of inheritance.

251
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:49,080
Okay. Team Leader Lee, Choi Na Ri, Team Leader Yoon, Baek Soo Jin,

252
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,350
Team Leader Kwon, Madam,

253
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:53,850
and Attorney Heo take care of Miss Mo Seok Hui and Mo Wan Soo.

254
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:57,540
Especially, be careful that we're working on the succession process.

255
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:59,150
Yes, Ma'am.

256
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:01,580
Let's take care of the family first and work

257
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:03,920
on stopping the amendment of the succession law from passing.

258
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:06,680
 In Korea,  despite anything said in a will, the decedent's spouse and children have reserved shares of the estate. 

259
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:13,060
Choi Na Ri is...

260
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,030
    

261
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:20,220
 Get here quick. Call me. 

262
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:41,680
What the.. What are you wearing?

263
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,210
Club maniac.

264
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:44,970
I'm going along with my role.

265
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:47,530
It looks ridiculous!

266
00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:50,220
We're here to do some serious business. Stop joking around.

267
00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:53,060
Ha.. but this is too funny.

268
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:59,230
Sorry, you can't go in.

269
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:24,350
Let's go.

270
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,910
Okay.

271
00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:33,910
Why is father hurrying along the choice of a successor?

272
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:37,540
Director Han interprets it as Chairman Mo’s peculiar obsession.

273
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:39,570
Obsession?

274
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:47,730
Father has started to keep Director Han in check.

275
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:52,090
He’s getting ready for when he gets older and has less power.

276
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:55,620
Since Mo Wan Joon can’t hold a candle to Director Han.

277
00:25:57,300 --> 00:26:00,170
And he’s probably scared to end up like Grandfather.

278
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:05,110
Not just you, but the whole family has to sign the document relinquishing their legal reserve of inheritance.

279
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:06,780
Will they agree to it?

280
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:10,090
Since it's TOP, they'll do whatever it takes to get it done.

281
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:13,760
TOP has always been a straight stretch of highway.

282
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:17,500
Shouldn't they experience some pot holes along the way  now?

283
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,850
What are you going to do?

284
00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:20,280
Divide and rule?

285
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:24,390
That's how powerful nations ruled the colonies during the days of Imperialism.

286
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:28,330
Creating division on the inside and preventing independence.

287
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:32,520
Making the family fight over their shares and creating a mess...

288
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,800
A way to take control of a group by using another group?

289
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:37,280
You're seriously more academic than you look.

290
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,020
Now we see eye to eye.

291
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:42,950
But if that happens, without a doubt they will suspect that I leaked the information.

292
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:47,620
In turn, we can use Director Han's suspicions against her.

293
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:51,400
Director Han isn't someone who would easily disarm herself.

294
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:54,380
You have to be on the dissection table at least once anyway.

295
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:57,650
Playing a spy seems to suit your constitution.

296
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:01,950
I am a investigative drama fan after all.

297
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:03,400
Don't forget.

298
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:08,020
A true lunatic Chaebol woman, that's me.

299
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:20,140
And let's go meet your mother this weekend. Make an appointment.

300
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:22,890
- Mom? 
 - Yeah.

301
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:26,060
The only person who can tell us about the murder case

302
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:29,930
is your mother. We have to visit her often.

303
00:27:29,930 --> 00:27:35,020
That's true, but if they find out about the visit, it's all over for us.

304
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:37,200
But how can I not do it?

305
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,960
As a spy, I have to save face.

306
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:01,970
Miss Seok Hui is entering.

307
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:17,270
Mind your manners in being prompt for meals.

308
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:20,740
I just saw an interesting article.

309
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:24,520
A beautiful hand over of MC Group's management rights.

310
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:28,750
It drives me crazy how beautiful it is!

311
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:33,980
Mo Seok Hui, I don't expect you to understand, but at least mind your manners.

312
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:37,260
They say I gave up my management rights to Father.

313
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:38,680
The response is no joke!

314
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:42,170
They're full of praises calling it best practices in family management.

315
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:46,210
You must be happy, Father, that you have Director Han who does her job so well.

316
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,050
But isn't it a too hypocritical?

317
00:28:50,050 --> 00:28:53,090
Hey, did you really give up your management rights?

318
00:28:53,090 --> 00:28:58,010
To be exact, it got snatched from me.

319
00:28:58,010 --> 00:29:00,050
Don't you think, Father?

320
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:04,490
Management rights is a given, I no longer have shares either.

321
00:29:04,490 --> 00:29:07,740
I can't invest in your movie even if I wanted to.

322
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:09,900
Really?

323
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:12,730
Father, is she really telling the truth?

324
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:15,910
This wasn't in my plans!

325
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:18,270
Hyung, then you can't release the movie?

326
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:19,750
You said you would let me do a special cameo.

327
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:23,240
That's not what's important right now, Brother. Can you please shut up?

328
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:25,690
Mother, is she telling the truth?

329
00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:27,210
Seok Hui,

330
00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:30,250
if after you signed it over because you weren't competent enough for it

331
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:32,280
you start changing your tune now,

332
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:35,030
you'd have to get admitted to a mental hospital.

333
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:39,840
Wow, are you now threatening me by trying to send me to a mental hospital?

334
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,230
Stepmother is really scary.

335
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:47,030
You're over 30, so let's be responsible for yourself now, huh?

336
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:51,120
How long will you buy your underwear with your father's money?

337
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:53,660
Chairman,

338
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:57,980
how about helping so that our Seok Hui can rely on herself?

339
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:04,490
I mean, I understand our Stepmother's beautiful big picture,

340
00:30:04,490 --> 00:30:09,860
but what to do? I love this loving and comfortable house so, so much that,

341
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:13,690
I can't even take a step out of this house.

342
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:16,260
What Mom  just said is not wrong at all.

343
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:20,910
You should learn to cook like your sister-in-law.

344
00:30:20,910 --> 00:30:25,580
I'd love for her to come with me.

345
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:27,140
What's wrong with you?

346
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:30,220
I'm busy enough as it is trying to live haphazardly!

347
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:37,860
Mister, your Daechidong academy called and said they're closed today.

348
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:39,630
Okay.

349
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:08,630
Noona, can we say that I came to see you after my academy?

350
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:11,900
- Academy was cancelled, so... 
 - Aha!

351
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:13,700
So.... you need an alibi?

352
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:16,590
The witch doesn't like me seeing my mom.

353
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:19,290
And mom is telling me to come out secretly.

354
00:31:19,290 --> 00:31:21,340
So you've been saying that you went to academy but instead went to see your mother.

355
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:25,760
Not everyday, just once a month.

356
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:30,710
Okay. I'll take you.

357
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,700
Is this the right place?

358
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:23,050
Whenever she comes here when she's run down to get a nutrition injection, she tells me to wait here.

359
00:32:23,050 --> 00:32:25,580
- Nutrition injection? 
 - Yeah.

360
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:27,160
But it is closed.

361
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:30,690
Since mom is so famous and gets easily recognized,

362
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:33,530
she says she comes when it's closed.

363
00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:37,260
Hey, where are you going?

364
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:53,690
Hey, hey. Why does she always meet you here?

365
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:56,540
She likes when she wakes up from the injection and sees my face.

366
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:58,700
So whenever she comes here, she sees me.

367
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:01,630
You should get one, too, it's supposed to be really good for your skin.

368
00:33:01,630 --> 00:33:04,570
My mom's really pretty, no?

369
00:33:04,570 --> 00:33:06,210
Should I?

370
00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:08,500
I'm leaving.

371
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:13,250
Don't tell your mom that you met me.

372
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:43,930
Welcome.

373
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:48,900
I came here because someone referred me.

374
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:52,210
Who introduced you to this place?

375
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:57,750
Actress Chae Na Ri.

376
00:33:57,750 --> 00:33:59,750
Please wait for a moment.

377
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:04,790
Yes, Director. We have a VIP.

378
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:27,230
What could be the reason you called out a busy person so far away?

379
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:29,760
It's right by your shooting location.

380
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:37,680
This is the deed for the land behind this cafe. It's about 16 acres.

381
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:39,540
So?

382
00:34:40,270 --> 00:34:43,030
It's a promise to give up Seo Jin's shares.

383
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:46,180
It also includes the fact that you won't request for the legal reserve of inheritance in the future.

384
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:49,830
If you sign here, you will be the owner of that land.

385
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:58,900
Within two years when the apartments start getting built, the value will go up.

386
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:07,270
Can't I wait until Seo Jin becomes an adult and decide then?

387
00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:09,570
No one can predict the future.

388
00:35:09,570 --> 00:35:13,060
At your age, you should think about your retirement too.

389
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:18,580
That's the sort of thing people like you worry about.

390
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:24,210
The appeal of being an actor is that there's no retirement age.

391
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:34,150
Before the Chairman finds out, I'll help resolve it.

392
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:42,480
The photos are a bit dated.

393
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:47,040
I was only coaching a junior actor, that's all.

394
00:35:47,930 --> 00:35:51,420
Isn't TOP a little lax these days?

395
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:53,550
What is it that you want?

396
00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:56,570
Your Majesty...

397
00:35:56,570 --> 00:35:58,200
Your Ma-

398
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:01,000
Your Majesty...

399
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,550
I'd rather you give me a death sentence...

400
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:09,850
It's not the time to be relaxing so freely right now.

401
00:36:09,850 --> 00:36:12,110
Why are you here?

402
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:14,990
You should get Seo Jin's share.

403
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:18,460
Do you know that they're taking steps for the succession?

404
00:36:19,570 --> 00:36:21,780
Why are you talking to me about that?

405
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:23,560
Because I think you are pretty?

406
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:29,310
No! It's because I'm worried about Seo Jin.

407
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:34,020
Seo Jin became a legitimate son of that household through legal means.

408
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:38,150
His future is bright, so worry about yourself.

409
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:41,270
You think they'll take care of you if you just stand by and wait, huh?

410
00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:43,740
You are more innocent than I thought.

411
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:47,650
What if you get thrown out with just some pocket money?

412
00:36:49,810 --> 00:36:52,320
Why should I believe you?

413
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:55,920
Miss Chae Na Ri, this household isn't that easy.

414
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:00,220
Thinking they'd take care of you since you're Seo Jin's mother?

415
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:02,500
That won't work.

416
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:07,910
You look like you've mastered being to hell and back. What's with the easy going attitude?

417
00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:11,320
TOP will show up with some documents soon.

418
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:15,560
Along with evidence to blackmail you.

419
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:18,640
Don't sign without thinking,

420
00:37:19,390 --> 00:37:21,960
and get a good grip.

421
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:31,960
Your skin really is amazing.

422
00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:37,100
You should retouch your make up here.

423
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:50,010
Since you don't have a child, you won't know a mother's heart.

424
00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:54,990
Seo Jin is the Chairman's son. That connection isn't going anywhere.

425
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:01,720
You shouldn't cage a baby tiger, no?

426
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:05,430
30% of shares.

427
00:38:08,890 --> 00:38:12,340
I have a busy shooting schedule, so I'm leaving.

428
00:38:40,390 --> 00:38:42,260
It's a divorce  document.

429
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:46,430
 Divorce Agreement ] 

430
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:51,780
It's what you wanted, and the alimony isn't small.

431
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:55,360
Now you can live freely.

432
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:00,320
Team Leader Yoon,

433
00:39:01,350 --> 00:39:04,820
I won't be getting a divorce.

434
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:08,230
I was surprised when you asked me to buy you a meal.

435
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:10,110
I always had to be careful of Mother-in-law,

436
00:39:10,110 --> 00:39:13,820
but to be honest, I like people with personalities like yours.

437
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:16,530
Well... that's a bit flattering.

438
00:39:16,530 --> 00:39:20,660
But... don't you feel suffocated living at the house?

439
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:26,670
What can I do? I just learn to cook and live out my prison sentence.

440
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:28,970
Why don't you have a baby?

441
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:36,230
We... don't sleep together.

442
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:38,230
Does he have a woman?

443
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:40,500
I guess he does?

444
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:44,700
No, maybe he doesn't have one since no one's found out yet?

445
00:39:46,290 --> 00:39:47,710
Why don't you just get a divorce then?

446
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:51,880
He won't budge. He tells me to deal with it until he becomes the successor.

447
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:57,320
He does whatever he wants, but you have to live like a mannequin at home?

448
00:39:57,320 --> 00:40:00,830
What kind of BS is this?

449
00:40:01,950 --> 00:40:06,620
In order for him to become a successor, I'd have to wait at least 10 years more.

450
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:10,630
I'll only age during that time...

451
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:18,350
Since you've held on this long, keep doing it.

452
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:20,810
What?

453
00:40:20,810 --> 00:40:22,950
If you divorce him after he becomes the heir,

454
00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:27,040
the alimony you'll get then will be incomparable to what you'll get now.

455
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:31,510
Wouldn't you feel less wronged if you get a financial guarantee?

456
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:37,170
Who knows? He might become the heir tomorrow.

457
00:40:47,090 --> 00:40:52,500
I... love Wan Joon.

458
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,210
You have taken care of us a lot all this time.

459
00:40:57,210 --> 00:41:00,840
We'll live well together. Don't worry.

460
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:05,190
I'll leave first then.

461
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:22,810
  Promise to Relinquish MC Group shares 

462
00:41:28,310 --> 00:41:31,680
So you want me to give up my shares for Wan Joon's sake?

463
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:35,930
But do I really have to do this?

464
00:41:35,930 --> 00:41:38,080
I am on Wan Joon's side.

465
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:41,880
Whether he has it or I have it.... isn't it the same?

466
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:45,670
For Director Mo Wan Joon's sake, you have to sign it.

467
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:48,640
But this isn't right.

468
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:52,390
You know how the Mo family is strictly for their own.

469
00:41:52,390 --> 00:41:56,970
If I divorce him, it would be the end for me. That's why I'm like this.

470
00:41:59,930 --> 00:42:03,520
I'll relay the message to Director Han.

471
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:07,380
Tell her that soon

472
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:10,140
we should have some tea together.

473
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:28,840
Who is it?

474
00:42:35,230 --> 00:42:38,230
Oh Lawyer Heo is here.

475
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:42,170
Wow, glad you came. I'm glad.

476
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,870
Buy me some food.

477
00:42:45,870 --> 00:42:47,760
Okay.

478
00:42:57,420 --> 00:42:59,750
Eat slowly.

479
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:05,410
When are you going to release the hold on the credit card limit?

480
00:43:05,410 --> 00:43:08,440
Oh, that's not my job, so...

481
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:10,150
Then why are you here?

482
00:43:10,150 --> 00:43:11,730
Ah... yes.

483
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:17,330
It's a promise to give up your shares.

484
00:43:17,330 --> 00:43:18,980
Oh. Okay.

485
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:24,140
I have a lot to say about that anyway.

486
00:43:27,170 --> 00:43:30,770
  Agreement to Reqlinquish MC Group shares   

487
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:36,930
Why is my share so little?

488
00:43:36,930 --> 00:43:40,170
This is not right.

489
00:43:40,170 --> 00:43:45,830
I'm giving up being the successor to my younger brother. Then shouldn't I get something in return?

490
00:43:45,830 --> 00:43:49,580
That is, not something for me to decide.

491
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:55,260
Lawyer Heo, listen well to what I'm saying.

492
00:43:55,260 --> 00:44:01,250
The eldest son of a Korean family is born already shouldering restrictions.

493
00:44:01,250 --> 00:44:04,220
Who does the ancestral rites? I do.

494
00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:09,260
When I get married and I have a son, he's the succeeding grandson.

495
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:13,690
It's only in name, you're telling me to live just sucking my own thumb.

496
00:44:13,690 --> 00:44:18,420
Lawyer Heo, this isn't right when you think about it, too, right?

497
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:21,900
Make sure you tell Director Han.

498
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:24,380
Yes, I'll let her know.

499
00:44:28,070 --> 00:44:30,600
You think the same too, right?

500
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:32,790
I don't really think that my opinion matters.

501
00:44:32,790 --> 00:44:36,270
Look at you. You did a good job of avoiding the question.

502
00:44:36,270 --> 00:44:39,190
I guess you learned a little bit of martial arts!

503
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:55,590
Lawyer Heo, do you know much about the arts?

504
00:44:55,590 --> 00:44:58,580
Arts? Me? Well...

505
00:44:58,580 --> 00:45:04,290
A masterpiece is usually born while carrying a curse.

506
00:45:05,270 --> 00:45:11,160
I was actually born with so much talent.

507
00:45:12,220 --> 00:45:15,050
But because I couldn't control that talent,

508
00:45:15,050 --> 00:45:17,460
I used up a bit of Father's money.

509
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:23,040
No... not a bit, but really a lot.

510
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:27,790
But, that's economic circulation, no?

511
00:45:27,790 --> 00:45:31,800
Father earns and I spend. Don't you think?

512
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:36,760
The fact that I'm having a hard time because of finances right now

513
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:40,290
is a hardship I'm enduring because a great work of art is going to come out.

514
00:45:40,290 --> 00:45:45,840
This great work of art isn't ever made that easily, you see?

515
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:49,630
Yes..... then about the signature...

516
00:45:49,630 --> 00:45:54,280
I can't, no, I won't.

517
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:57,530
I got it, I'll take my leave.

518
00:45:57,530 --> 00:46:01,660
Tell Director Han well, and also,

519
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:04,590
leave the bag that's in the trunk when you leave.

520
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:10,760
I know that you always carry money in the bag.

521
00:46:28,470 --> 00:46:31,420
Are you having a difficult time with your movie production?

522
00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:33,500
Are you being serious with that question?

523
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:37,030
Right now everything is on hold because I can't pay the staff's salary.

524
00:46:37,030 --> 00:46:39,580
I'm about to go mad.

525
00:46:39,580 --> 00:46:42,830
I told them so proudly that I was going to get production money!

526
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:49,290
Seok Hui, is there any way?

527
00:46:49,290 --> 00:46:53,130
You have a lot of jewelry and luxury goods. Let's sell that off first for now.

528
00:46:53,130 --> 00:46:56,860
If my movie becomes a hit, I'll repay you in total.

529
00:46:56,860 --> 00:47:00,930
What are you so afraid of that you can't request your own shares? Are you an idiot?

530
00:47:00,930 --> 00:47:05,330
What are you talking about? Father is healthy. Why would I talk about the shares?

531
00:47:05,330 --> 00:47:09,110
Get your hands on the inheritance and use in advance what the eldest son gets according to law.

532
00:47:09,110 --> 00:47:12,150
If you don't have it in you to talk to Father, you can speak to Director Han.

533
00:47:12,150 --> 00:47:15,410
Right, you better get a lawyer first.

534
00:47:15,410 --> 00:47:19,710
You know you can't talk to TOP with a second-rate law firm, right?

535
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:23,730
Then, could I do that?

536
00:47:23,730 --> 00:47:25,210
Why not?

537
00:47:25,210 --> 00:47:29,450
Why not?  Father has a lot of money. He took all of mine.

538
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:47,360
Choi Na Ri asked for 30% as Mo Seo Jin's share and asked for participation in management.

539
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:49,520
Madam Baek Soo Jin refused to get a divorce.

540
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:50,820
But she wanted it.

541
00:47:50,820 --> 00:47:52,480
She said she loves him.

542
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:54,300
What's with the talk of love all of a sudden?

543
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:57,640
I think we need to modify the terms for Madam Ha Yeong Seo as well.

544
00:47:58,510 --> 00:48:02,890
Mo Wan Soo is requesting not only the shares as the eldest son but also the shares for his future child.

545
00:48:02,890 --> 00:48:07,030
Really? Did something change with him?

546
00:48:07,030 --> 00:48:09,650
We're continuing to follow Master Wan Soo's relationships with women,

547
00:48:09,650 --> 00:48:13,050
but there's nothing about any child and nothing of note in his relationships with women.

548
00:48:13,050 --> 00:48:15,890
And also, the emergency funds...

549
00:48:15,890 --> 00:48:17,940
He got his hands on it again...

550
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:21,660
How many times has it been? It's the third time already.

551
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:22,560
What about Miss?

552
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:25,700
Yes, she says she wants nothing as long as she has a black card.

553
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:26,660
Really?

554
00:48:26,660 --> 00:48:28,590
Come in.

555
00:48:28,590 --> 00:48:31,300
Come in, come in, come in.

556
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:36,010
Hi everyone. You're working hard.

557
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:42,900
Director Han, you know of Harvard, right?

558
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:46,930
This Lawyer Seon came out of Harvard apparently.

559
00:48:46,930 --> 00:48:50,460
He's with the largest law firm, Big Sun.

560
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:54,760
He's so young but very smart.

561
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:56,910
You're too kind.

562
00:48:56,910 --> 00:49:01,460
Oh, I'm Lawyer Seon Ho Jin from Big Sun.

563
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:04,550
You heard somewhat from Lawyer Heo, right?

564
00:49:04,550 --> 00:49:09,290
But I'm an artist, so I'm a little lacking when it comes to money.

565
00:49:09,290 --> 00:49:12,180
This Lawyer Seon is an expert,

566
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:15,450
so please speak well with him.

567
00:49:15,450 --> 00:49:17,510
Lawyer Seon Ho Jin?

568
00:49:17,510 --> 00:49:19,050
Yes.

569
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:29,030
How are you managing your lawyers?!

570
00:49:32,150 --> 00:49:34,500
You have to accept this call.

571
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:39,140
Yes, this is Seon Ho Jin.

572
00:49:39,140 --> 00:49:42,790
 Hey, you jerk, how dare you walk in there? 

573
00:49:42,790 --> 00:49:44,980
 Get out of there right now! 

574
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:48,030
 Come back right away. You want to see me go crazy? 

575
00:49:48,030 --> 00:49:49,530
No, not at all.

576
00:49:49,530 --> 00:49:51,230
 Get over here now!  

577
00:49:51,230 --> 00:49:55,840
Yes, I understand, yes, yes, yes ...

578
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:59,390
Director Go of Big Sun is my junior as well as my business partner.

579
00:49:59,390 --> 00:50:04,000
You've been overseas a long time, right? It'll take some time for you to find your footing.

580
00:50:04,910 --> 00:50:07,010
I'll talk to you later..

581
00:50:08,210 --> 00:50:09,970
I will give you a call.

582
00:50:09,970 --> 00:50:12,030
Oh, okay.

583
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:16,540
Why are you doing this?

584
00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:19,450
That's a great question.

585
00:50:19,450 --> 00:50:24,230
Director Han, do you know how old I am?

586
00:50:24,230 --> 00:50:27,090
Till when do I have to live a pathetic life like this?

587
00:50:27,090 --> 00:50:30,250
I told you to wait for the right time, didn't I?

588
00:50:30,250 --> 00:50:32,170
Then...

589
00:50:33,220 --> 00:50:35,990
Give me a black card like Seok Hui.

590
00:50:35,990 --> 00:50:37,420
Okay.

591
00:50:37,420 --> 00:50:39,990
Okay!

592
00:50:41,630 --> 00:50:44,270
You promised, okay?

593
00:50:44,270 --> 00:50:46,370
I'll leave.

594
00:50:58,340 --> 00:51:00,720
Get a black card for Mo Wan Soo.

595
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:02,800
Okay.

596
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:07,000
- Lawyer Heo, have you had the coffee that I made? 
 - No.

597
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,950
Let's go upstairs.

598
00:51:22,550 --> 00:51:25,080
It's a bit strong. It's okay, right?

599
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:27,400
Yes, I'm okay with it.

600
00:51:35,580 --> 00:51:37,420
Drink it.

601
00:51:47,820 --> 00:51:50,590
Isn't it time for you to disarm yourself now?

602
00:51:51,270 --> 00:51:55,510
Does that mean that you still don't trust me?

603
00:51:55,510 --> 00:51:58,610
Isn't TOP aware of every movement of the team members?

604
00:51:58,610 --> 00:52:03,100
Exactly. I know you've been going to the club a lot with Miss lately.

605
00:52:03,100 --> 00:52:06,660
Yes, that's... I met up with her privately.

606
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:09,160
I actually like going to clubs.

607
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:12,410
The younger Madam wanted a divorce from the day she got married.

608
00:52:12,410 --> 00:52:14,980
But suddenly she changed her mind.

609
00:52:14,980 --> 00:52:19,590
The eldest who's crazy about movies is suddenly interested in management.

610
00:52:19,590 --> 00:52:23,420
Even the youngest's mom is asking for shares.

611
00:52:28,630 --> 00:52:32,950
I'm suspecting that Mo Seok Hui is behind all of this.

612
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:37,560
I don't think that you have leaked any information,

613
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:41,530
because I'm sure you are not such a simple person.

614
00:52:41,530 --> 00:52:46,100
I have no reason to share any information with her.

615
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:48,170
Exactly.

616
00:52:49,150 --> 00:52:52,730
Prove to me that you didn't give her any information.

617
00:52:52,730 --> 00:52:58,260
Director, one's feelings... how can you prove the innocence of that?

618
00:52:58,260 --> 00:53:03,320
I don't know.... I'm also curious about it.

619
00:53:14,340 --> 00:53:19,490
  MC Global  

620
00:53:26,540 --> 00:53:31,570
So what you're saying is Mo Seok Hui's mother was murdered 15 years ago,

621
00:53:31,570 --> 00:53:35,980
and the housekeeper was proven to be the culprit, but she's not actually the person.

622
00:53:35,980 --> 00:53:39,600
Bingo. At the time, TOP covered that whole issue completely.

623
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:43,090
They probably influenced the press as well as the prosecution.

624
00:53:43,090 --> 00:53:45,310
Wow, this is total hit if we can get something on this.

625
00:53:45,310 --> 00:53:46,690
This goose father (family lives abroad) you freely scorn

626
00:53:46,690 --> 00:53:50,880
got fired from the paper while digging into that story.

627
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:53,640
Then making a deal with TOP's Lee Gyeong Ah was for a reason, too?

628
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:57,450
Of course. And I think something very interesting is happening after the arrival of Mo Seok Hui,

629
00:53:57,450 --> 00:54:00,130
so what's the point of dealing with a small time issue like Marijuana at this point?

630
00:54:00,130 --> 00:54:03,790
We could use TOP's Lee Kyeong Ah to our benefit, too.

631
00:54:03,790 --> 00:54:06,170
Oh, not everyone can be a captain I see!

632
00:54:06,170 --> 00:54:07,900
Don't dare to kick me just because I'm a goose father.

633
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:10,530
Have you ever had passion for someone?

634
00:54:10,530 --> 00:54:12,600
This weakling of a goose's heart hurts.

635
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:15,200
I got it. I take it back.

636
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:19,850
Anyway, statute of limitations is over, so let's work on it.

637
00:54:22,060 --> 00:54:24,070
But Captain...

638
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:27,340
I just got total goosebumps!

639
00:54:27,340 --> 00:54:29,460
Should we turn the air conditioning off? The electricity bills is high enough as it is.

640
00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:32,730
The rent is behind a lot, too, since I had to pay you so much.

641
00:54:32,730 --> 00:54:36,920
You know Lawyer Heo Yoon Do, Mo Seok Hui's personal lawyer,

642
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:39,450
that lawyer felt so familiar from the start.

643
00:54:39,450 --> 00:54:42,420
You like that kind of man? I thought you liked men like me.

644
00:54:42,420 --> 00:54:47,960
Not that, when I was in second year of middle school, we had a kid named Park Tae Ho in our class.

645
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:51,450
He was fat, but he didn't talk a lot and he was horrible in school too.

646
00:54:51,450 --> 00:54:55,430
Anyway, whenever I see Lawyer Heo, he reminds me of that kid. It's weird.

647
00:54:55,430 --> 00:54:56,380
It's weird.

648
00:54:56,380 --> 00:54:57,890
Maybe they just have similar faces.

649
00:54:57,890 --> 00:55:00,750
Now that I think about it,

650
00:55:00,750 --> 00:55:04,000
I heard that Tae Ho's mom killed a person around that time.

651
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,670
- Really? 
 - Yes.

652
00:55:06,670 --> 00:55:10,530
I don't remember well, but I heard that his mom was

653
00:55:10,530 --> 00:55:13,210
a housekeeper for some Chaebol family.

654
00:55:13,210 --> 00:55:14,160
So?

655
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:16,980
Then... one day, he just vanished.

656
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:18,530
He didn't come to school as well.

657
00:55:18,530 --> 00:55:19,860
Really?

658
00:55:19,860 --> 00:55:24,770
For some reason I feel like Heo Yoon Do is Park Tae Ho.

659
00:55:24,770 --> 00:55:26,660
You could say it's a journalist's sixth sense.

660
00:55:26,660 --> 00:55:29,790
You have to use that sense well as a journalist. That's how you become a good journalist.

661
00:55:29,790 --> 00:55:33,000
If you feel that way, look into Park Tae Ho later.

662
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,530
Let's use this opportunity to get info on Lawyer Heo,

663
00:55:35,530 --> 00:55:37,840
so dig up something around him.

664
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:38,910
Yes, sir.

665
00:55:38,910 --> 00:55:41,300
I like that answer.

666
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:42,820
- I'll give you an award. 
 - Yes, sir.

667
00:55:42,820 --> 00:55:44,580
Stop it now.

668
00:55:47,910 --> 00:55:48,990
Are going for a run again?

669
00:55:48,990 --> 00:55:50,890
Why? Do you want to come with me today?

670
00:55:50,890 --> 00:55:55,090
Are you trying to make fun of me? Exercise is for people who have the time.

671
00:55:55,090 --> 00:55:57,780
For people like us who have to earn a living daily to live,

672
00:55:57,780 --> 00:55:59,510
exercising is a luxury.

673
00:55:59,510 --> 00:56:01,680
Why are you making me feel sorry all of a sudden?

674
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:04,430
What do you mean sorry? Our levels are different.

675
00:56:04,430 --> 00:56:07,080
You're a top level lawyer.

676
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:12,430
For me, I don't have much luck in this lifetime,

677
00:56:12,430 --> 00:56:14,220
but you have to live well.

678
00:56:14,220 --> 00:56:16,900
- I guess you are mad. 
 - Who is?

679
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:21,230
Just leave the restaurant as it is, I'll come back and clean it up.

680
00:56:21,230 --> 00:56:24,390
Forget about it, just go, go.

681
00:56:24,390 --> 00:56:26,970
I can't go now since you're mad. You take three months to get over it usually.

682
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:31,100
I said I'm not mad.  Hurry. Quickly. Go.

683
00:56:32,050 --> 00:56:33,990
Just go.

684
00:56:41,730 --> 00:56:46,000
It's not okay for you to live like your father.

685
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:50,890
You have to workout like others and live diligently.

686
00:56:50,890 --> 00:56:55,070
Son, fighting.

687
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:58,590
Oh.

688
00:56:59,250 --> 00:57:01,090
What?

689
00:57:02,020 --> 00:57:06,140
Hyungnim, I have a serious proposal to make.

690
00:57:06,140 --> 00:57:08,320
Whenever you say something, I get very nervous.

691
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:10,430
I don't know why when I don't get like this even with the Chief.

692
00:57:10,430 --> 00:57:11,890
I'm not joking.

693
00:57:11,890 --> 00:57:13,590
I'm not joking either, Punk.

694
00:57:13,590 --> 00:57:17,450
Only the cold case department stays inside and does paperwork at the office, right?

695
00:57:17,450 --> 00:57:19,250
You're putting me down very slyly, aren't you?

696
00:57:19,250 --> 00:57:21,350
Fine, after 40 years of my life,

697
00:57:21,350 --> 00:57:23,960
I've finally found a position that suits me. What about it?

698
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:26,870
Let's re-investigate my mother's case.

699
00:57:26,870 --> 00:57:27,930
What?

700
00:57:27,930 --> 00:57:33,000
To be honest, my mom's case could be considered a cold case, too.

701
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,180
That's what you think.

702
00:57:34,180 --> 00:57:36,580
I'm being serious.

703
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:43,450
Pretend that you have two secret agents with you and let's work together.

704
00:57:43,450 --> 00:57:46,330
So when we catch the real culprit, you'll be happy to get promoted,

705
00:57:46,330 --> 00:57:49,410
and I'll be happy to clear my mom's name.

706
00:57:50,260 --> 00:57:52,670
But why are there two agents?

707
00:57:53,580 --> 00:57:56,060
- Mo Seok Hui. 
 - Mo Seok Hui?

708
00:57:56,060 --> 00:57:58,190
- MC's Mo Seok Hui? 
 - Yes.

709
00:57:58,190 --> 00:58:00,580
The cost for the investigation will be covered by our side.

710
00:58:00,580 --> 00:58:04,630
And all you have to do is give support in the area of governmental authority.

711
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:08,160
Catch the real culprit?

712
00:58:09,060 --> 00:58:12,200
- Deal? 
 - Deal.

713
00:58:12,890 --> 00:58:13,980
Give me your phone.

714
00:58:13,980 --> 00:58:16,190
Why my phone?

715
00:58:38,750 --> 00:58:42,270
Should I go for a run?

716
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:50,270
Director Han is suspicious of me.

717
00:58:50,270 --> 00:58:51,860
I told you that would happen.

718
00:58:51,860 --> 00:58:54,560
She told me to prove that I'm innocent.

719
00:58:56,980 --> 00:59:01,130
- She wants you to bring some intel she can trust? 
 - Exactly.

720
00:59:01,130 --> 00:59:04,070
Don't worry, I have a plan.

721
00:59:04,070 --> 00:59:06,900
- What is it? 
 - I'll let you know on the way.

722
00:59:06,900 --> 00:59:09,060
Okay, see you tomorrow.

723
00:59:10,060 --> 00:59:12,940
You're built like a mountain,

724
00:59:12,940 --> 00:59:15,440
but you have no stamina.

725
00:59:19,750 --> 00:59:22,070
You're the best! Fine!

726
00:59:43,790 --> 00:59:46,350
But is he trustworthy?

727
00:59:46,350 --> 00:59:51,290
Of course. He's been like family to me since junior high.

728
00:59:56,590 --> 00:59:58,320
He's here.

729
01:00:00,040 --> 01:00:02,420
- You came?
 - Yes.

730
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:05,590
Hello.

731
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:09,090
I put the ticket in the car.

732
01:00:09,090 --> 01:00:12,550
Have fun with your family at the amusement part.

733
01:00:12,550 --> 01:00:15,920
Okay, don't worry and have a good visit with your mom.

734
01:00:17,230 --> 01:00:18,930
Get in.

735
01:01:32,910 --> 01:01:34,750
Take a seat, Mom.

736
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:40,690
What is it? Why are you here with the Miss?

737
01:01:40,690 --> 01:01:43,620
It's a long story.

738
01:01:43,620 --> 01:01:45,530
Sit down.

739
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:58,150
We are going to investigate your case properly.

740
01:01:58,150 --> 01:02:01,220
I told the people on the prison side that you've hired a lawyer.

741
01:02:01,220 --> 01:02:03,100
No, don't do it.

742
01:02:03,100 --> 01:02:05,320
I told you that you would be in danger.

743
01:02:05,320 --> 01:02:06,590
Don't do it.

744
01:02:06,590 --> 01:02:10,060
Cho Rok Law Firm's Han Cheol Soo is your attorney.

745
01:02:10,060 --> 01:02:13,150
Of course, it's fake. I'm the real one.

746
01:02:13,150 --> 01:02:17,850
Ahjumma, who threatened you?

747
01:02:17,850 --> 01:02:20,380
I can't.

748
01:02:20,380 --> 01:02:22,630
I can't say.

749
01:02:38,900 --> 01:02:43,400
Mom, I'm all grown up.

750
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:46,380
I'm an adult and a lawyer.

751
01:02:46,380 --> 01:02:50,900
I can protect you and myself, so, don't worry about it.

752
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:57,140
How can I live happily knowing you were wrongfully put in here.

753
01:02:58,140 --> 01:03:01,440
So, now you should help me.

754
01:03:14,310 --> 01:03:20,240
Madam didn't have any friends and didn't like going outside.

755
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:22,910
She always stayed at home, painting.

756
01:03:22,910 --> 01:03:26,490
She never went to a hospital, the doctors came home to her.

757
01:03:26,490 --> 01:03:28,790
Mom was sick right?

758
01:03:28,790 --> 01:03:31,030
She didn't have a grave illness.

759
01:03:31,030 --> 01:03:34,070
She took pills often saying that her head hurt.

760
01:03:34,070 --> 01:03:38,260
But whenever she took pills, she slept all day.

761
01:03:38,260 --> 01:03:43,020
That's true. I've eaten alone with you a lot because she was sleeping a lot.

762
01:03:43,020 --> 01:03:45,810
Do you know what kind of medicine that was?

763
01:03:45,810 --> 01:03:47,870
I don't know.

764
01:03:47,870 --> 01:03:52,550
It was a white pill. At first she only took one pill at a time,

765
01:03:52,550 --> 01:03:55,370
later she took a lot of it.

766
01:03:57,370 --> 01:04:03,780
Right... one time she got angry at the doctor and shouted at her..

767
01:04:03,780 --> 01:04:04,710
Why?

768
01:04:04,710 --> 01:04:08,270
She asked if someone ordered them to give the medicine to her.

769
01:04:08,270 --> 01:04:09,420
So what happened?

770
01:04:09,420 --> 01:04:12,170
That Seongbookdong's Madam put them up to it.

771
01:04:12,170 --> 01:04:15,070
That's what the doctor said.

772
01:04:15,070 --> 01:04:16,190
Ha Yeong Seo...

773
01:04:16,190 --> 01:04:18,340
Ha Yeong Seo?

774
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:22,100
Do you, by chance, remember the name of the doctor?

775
01:04:22,100 --> 01:04:28,060
No, I don't know the name, but I remember

776
01:04:28,060 --> 01:04:29,990
Madam always called the person Doctor Seol, Doctor Seol.

777
01:04:29,990 --> 01:04:31,150
Doctor Seol?

778
01:04:31,150 --> 01:04:36,350
That last name is unusual, so we laughed about it.

779
01:04:36,350 --> 01:04:42,630
Doctor Seol is odd no matter which way you say it.

780
01:04:42,630 --> 01:04:46,450
 TN. One of the meanings for seol is insufficient. 

781
01:04:55,690 --> 01:05:01,610
Ha Yeong Seo... did that woman really have something to do with my mom's death?

782
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:07,650
It's probably true that she told the doctor to prescribe the white medicine.

783
01:05:07,650 --> 01:05:10,190
It's been a long time since then, how do we know for sure?

784
01:05:10,190 --> 01:05:14,310
We write a memo to remember things.

785
01:05:14,310 --> 01:05:18,070
But for my mom, memo is the hardest thing for her to do.

786
01:05:18,070 --> 01:05:19,250
Why?

787
01:05:19,250 --> 01:05:22,110
My mom doesn't know how to read and write.

788
01:05:22,110 --> 01:05:26,510
If someone is lacking in something, they are forced to to improve something else.

789
01:05:26,510 --> 01:05:30,530
Just like how people with weak legs have strong arms.

790
01:05:32,660 --> 01:05:38,930
So, my mom tried to remember more by pushing herself.

791
01:05:38,930 --> 01:05:42,750
So that's why she remembers things like that. She is that kind of a person.

792
01:05:42,750 --> 01:05:45,840
You could say it's her own method to navigate through the world.

793
01:05:45,840 --> 01:05:52,070
If she remembered that your mom had an argument with her doctor, she's probably remembering it correctly.

794
01:05:52,070 --> 01:05:55,110
First, the most urgent matter is finding a doctor with the Seol last name.

795
01:05:55,110 --> 01:05:56,940
I'll ask Detective Oh to look into it.

796
01:05:56,940 --> 01:06:01,210
You said we can't look at the files of the investigation and the trial from that time, right?

797
01:06:01,210 --> 01:06:04,670
Yeah. I applied for review through Detective Oh but it shows that they don't exist.

798
01:06:04,670 --> 01:06:07,900
I was thinking to do that personally, too.

799
01:06:07,900 --> 01:06:11,890
Mo Seok Hui is looking into the murder case after coming back 15 years later?

800
01:06:11,890 --> 01:06:14,890
If director Han knows about it, would she do nothing about it?

801
01:06:16,540 --> 01:06:22,000
All the official documents were probably masked, and the real files were probably hidden away by Director Han.

802
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:25,150
The people connected to the murder case, especially.

803
01:06:25,150 --> 01:06:28,850
Prosecutor Joo Heyong Il, it's a way to keep him forever under her control.

804
01:06:28,850 --> 01:06:31,500
Finding the file is urgent now.

805
01:06:31,500 --> 01:06:36,050
So I'm going to look into the files at TOP as soon as I can.

806
01:06:46,930 --> 01:06:49,590
- What is it? 
 - Look at it.

807
01:06:57,550 --> 01:06:59,990
 Treatment History 

808
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:11,000
Tell Director Han.

809
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,690
If TOP finds out, it'll put Choi Na Ri at a big disadvantage.

810
01:07:13,690 --> 01:07:17,320
She's connected to Father, so they can't destroy her that easily.

811
01:07:17,320 --> 01:07:19,710
If they do, they'll go down together.

812
01:07:19,710 --> 01:07:24,270
Choi Na Ri will win the more she holds out.

813
01:07:24,270 --> 01:07:28,010
But in the meantime, you have to gain Director Han's trust with this.

814
01:07:28,010 --> 01:07:31,150
How did you find this?

815
01:07:31,150 --> 01:07:33,220
I think I was in the FBI in my former life.

816
01:07:33,220 --> 01:07:37,140
I had a feeling, so I put on an act at the clinic a bit.

817
01:07:37,140 --> 01:07:40,630
Something like this is nothing for me anyway.

818
01:07:41,530 --> 01:07:43,760
But not everyone can do it.

819
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:48,300
I know. You're so amazing that I nearly fainted.

820
01:07:56,850 --> 01:07:58,870
What a lousy car...

821
01:07:58,870 --> 01:08:00,770
The car's a bit...

822
01:08:12,190 --> 01:08:14,940
  Rode Real Estate    

823
01:08:14,940 --> 01:08:17,250
Heo Jang Soo? I know him.

824
01:08:17,250 --> 01:08:21,280
I've lived in this neighborhood for 20 years.

825
01:08:21,280 --> 01:08:25,010
I know Heo Jang Soo very well.

826
01:08:25,010 --> 01:08:29,000
15 years ago, he had a duck restaurant across the street I hear. Is it true?

827
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:33,970
Of course. At that time, the business was great.

828
01:08:33,970 --> 01:08:37,280
His life was ruined because of that mishap.

829
01:08:37,280 --> 01:08:40,570
- That mishap?  - His son and his wife 

830
01:08:40,570 --> 01:08:42,520
died in a car accident.

831
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:45,220
-Died in a car accident? -
 Yes.

832
01:08:45,220 --> 01:08:48,140
With the wife and kid dying at the same time,

833
01:08:48,140 --> 01:08:50,260
How can a person live?

834
01:08:50,260 --> 01:08:54,760
I went to the funeral, and he was a mess.

835
01:08:54,760 --> 01:08:59,620
In the end, soon, he left the area.

836
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:10,140
So, Heo Yoon Do died in a car accident?

837
01:09:13,400 --> 01:09:18,250
- So? 
 - I picked up the last steamed bun,

838
01:09:18,250 --> 01:09:20,640
And Yoon Do picked it at the same time.

839
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:23,180
We were both chubby at the time.

840
01:09:23,180 --> 01:09:24,460
Isn't it fated?

841
01:09:24,460 --> 01:09:28,500
- Yes, so you met him for the first time then? 
 - Yes.

842
01:09:28,500 --> 01:09:32,090
I transferred and he did, too, so we didn't have friends.

843
01:09:32,090 --> 01:09:34,340
But through that incident, we became close.

844
01:09:34,340 --> 01:09:38,330
From then till now we are friends.

845
01:09:40,510 --> 01:09:44,020
So before he transferred, where did he go to school?

846
01:09:44,020 --> 01:09:46,150
My Yoon Do?

847
01:09:46,150 --> 01:09:50,480
He... where?

848
01:09:50,480 --> 01:09:54,300
Perhaps was it Mapo side?

849
01:09:54,300 --> 01:09:57,430
No, Dapshimri.

850
01:09:59,110 --> 01:10:03,380
But, is he popular among girls?

851
01:10:03,380 --> 01:10:05,140
- Why? 
 - I mean,

852
01:10:05,140 --> 01:10:08,250
ever since he got the job, women keep showing up here.

853
01:10:08,250 --> 01:10:10,720
Really? Who else came by?

854
01:10:10,720 --> 01:10:13,140
You know, the lunatic from the Chaebol family.

855
01:10:13,140 --> 01:10:14,790
Lunatic?

856
01:10:17,490 --> 01:10:18,960
Are you jealous?

857
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:20,560
Jealous....

858
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:26,370
How can we be compared? We're friends for 15 years!

859
01:10:26,370 --> 01:10:31,710
Anyway, is it true that this place was mentioned as the place to eat at?

860
01:10:31,710 --> 01:10:36,290
Yes, I came to find this restaurant after I read a blog.

861
01:10:36,290 --> 01:10:38,090
Blog?

862
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:42,650
You're a reporter, and you said you know our Yoon Do,

863
01:10:42,650 --> 01:10:43,960
so please spread the word.

864
01:10:43,960 --> 01:10:46,870
I'll take care of you well from now on!

865
01:10:48,140 --> 01:10:49,670
Yes, Of course, of course.

866
01:10:49,670 --> 01:10:51,810
I'll come by often.

867
01:10:53,450 --> 01:10:56,000
There's really no need for that.

868
01:10:58,990 --> 01:11:01,400
Should I have another then?

869
01:11:05,170 --> 01:11:07,780
Son, let's try this.

870
01:11:07,780 --> 01:11:08,940
What is it?

871
01:11:08,940 --> 01:11:12,660
Eun Bi brought it. She said to have you use it.

872
01:11:12,660 --> 01:11:14,650
Forget it, you do it.

873
01:11:14,650 --> 01:11:19,040
You are popular amongst girls, you should take care of your skin.

874
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:22,840
Who said that I am popular amongst girls?

875
01:11:22,840 --> 01:11:25,800
That...that...

876
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:28,950
Was it Reporter Oh? The lady reporter came here.

877
01:11:28,950 --> 01:11:30,590
Reporter Oh Gwang Mi?

878
01:11:30,590 --> 01:11:33,310
She said she came to eat here after hearing about it.

879
01:11:33,310 --> 01:11:37,690
The way I see it, she has an interest in you.

880
01:11:37,690 --> 01:11:40,940
She asked in detail where you went to junior high.

881
01:11:40,940 --> 01:11:43,910
- So?
  - I didn't say anything much.

882
01:11:51,890 --> 01:11:53,590
Here.

883
01:11:54,850 --> 01:11:57,780
I said I'm not doing this.

884
01:11:58,930 --> 01:12:01,770
Your face is small, so it fits perfectly.

885
01:12:01,770 --> 01:12:03,760
I have space left when I use it.

886
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:05,990
I'm going to become even more handsome?

887
01:12:05,990 --> 01:12:07,380
What?

888
01:12:07,380 --> 01:12:09,220
Anyway...

889
01:12:12,410 --> 01:12:17,320
According to someone who knows Lawyer Heo's father well, he says Lawyer Heo and his mother died in an accident 15 years ago.

890
01:12:17,320 --> 01:12:21,990
What? How is a dead person still alive?

891
01:12:21,990 --> 01:12:23,890
Is he saying he was resurrected or something?

892
01:12:23,890 --> 01:12:29,600
But looking into it, the death record showed only his mother, not him.

893
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:32,270
Maybe he doesn't remember correctly.

894
01:12:32,270 --> 01:12:36,720
I too didn't believe him and went to see a few more people who attended the funeral at the time.

895
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:40,580
And they held a funeral for the mother and son both.

896
01:13:12,790 --> 01:13:14,460
You're here?

897
01:13:14,460 --> 01:13:16,300
Sit.

898
01:13:22,380 --> 01:13:25,730
- What is it? 
 - Look at it yourself.

899
01:13:34,720 --> 01:13:36,600
How did you get this?

900
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:39,580
I used Mo Seok Hui.

901
01:13:40,870 --> 01:13:43,420
- You worked hard. 
  - Yes.

902
01:13:46,150 --> 01:13:49,480
- Heo Yoon Do. 
 - Yes?

903
01:13:49,480 --> 01:13:51,480
Who are you?

904
01:13:51,480 --> 01:13:52,390
Pardon?

905
01:13:52,390 --> 01:13:55,190
Are you really Heo Yoon Do?

906
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:06,020


907
01:14:06,020 --> 01:14:14,670
♫  My destiny. I think everything is a dream.  ♫

908
01:14:14,670 --> 01:14:22,930
♫  Will I have to give everything up now  ♫

909
01:14:22,930 --> 01:14:29,690
♫  I think everyone is lying  ♫

910
01:14:29,690 --> 01:14:31,570
 Graceful Family Preview. 

911
01:14:31,570 --> 01:14:33,960
I'm Choi Na Ri's son's father.

912
01:14:33,960 --> 01:14:35,440
Who is my real father?

913
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:37,630
Isn't it cowardly?

914
01:14:37,630 --> 01:14:39,900
Our Director Han is scared.

915
01:14:39,900 --> 01:14:42,360
From this moment on, Seok Hui should be watched 24/7.

916
01:14:42,360 --> 01:14:43,760
Don't provoke TOP any more.

917
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:44,760
Don't be mistaken.

918
01:14:44,760 --> 01:14:47,630
I told you not to become a monster while chasing one.

919
01:14:47,630 --> 01:14:49,420
Why do you live?

920
01:14:49,420 --> 01:14:50,680
Why do you live, Father?

921
01:14:50,680 --> 01:14:54,020
Chairman Mo Cheol Hui is actress Choi Na Ri's son's father.

922
01:14:54,020 --> 01:14:56,170
The real suspect has finally shown up.

923
01:14:56,170 --> 01:14:58,810
Do you want to see them writhing and dying?
