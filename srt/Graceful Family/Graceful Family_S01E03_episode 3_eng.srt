 Episode 3  
 The Defendant betrayed the victim's kindness toward her and

7
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:41,220
for taking away a precious life through brutal means,

in the application of a stern  law and justice, under Article 250  of the Criminal Code,

00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:49,820
Defendant Im Soon,  I sentence you to life imprisonment without parole.

What?

11
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:54,680
L- life without parole?

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,110
Your Honor, I didn’t commit the murder.

13
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:11,850
I didn’t do it. I’ve been wronged!

14
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:16,790
Miss Lawyer, this isn’t what you promised me!

00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:37,880

 kicked out of her family and forced to go to the US.

 The only person the girl trusted at the time was... 

41
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,570
I can....

42
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:05,620
really come back soon, right?

00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:09,100

give it back to me then.

48
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:17,240
Send her to a boarding school without a single Korean.

49
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:20,490
Prevent her from contacting anyone here and confiscate her passport.

50
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:24,250
Miss Mo Seok Hui will never set foot in Korea again.

51
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,510
 But Director Han trampled on the promise she made, 

52
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:41,380
 and the girl  is now old enough to go to war with her.

00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:55,080
Let go. I didn’t do it.

56
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:58,500
I- I didn’t do it.

57
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:12,390
Mo Seok Hui, don’t say anything! Plead the Fifth. You know, don’t you?

58
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:24,100
Who are you?

59
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:28,490
I’m from News Patch. I’m doing a report on Mo Seok Hui. Is something wrong?

60
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:55,050
Mo Seok Hui has been arrested for possession of drugs, and a News Patch reporter got pictures.

61
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:56,230
 Really? 

62
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:59,560
But... the prosecutors came to the scene instead of the police.

63
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,370
I’m on my way to the Central Distirct Prosecutor”s Office,

64
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:04,970
- As soon as you get there, assess the scene and call me back.
 - Yes.

65
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:11,630
It’s killer. Huh?

66
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:14,600
If we do a full story on Mo Seok Hui's identity to her being arrested on marijuana charges, that'll be enough news for a month.

67
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,450
it will be a month's worth of news.

68
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:19,850
It's a shot I got while risking my life, you know?

69
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:24,200
Seriously, even if I think about it, I'm just amazing!

70
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:28,990
No, so, so, so, so ...

71
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:31,250
I want you write more about the prosecutor.

72
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,960
We should upload the article first.

73
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,990
No, our opponent is MC Group.

74
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:39,390
We could suffer if the charges are dismissed after we upload it.

75
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:42,310
Mo Seok Hui's story is shocking and dangerous.

76
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:46,880
We already got the exclusive, so let's wait until we see what  the prosecution does.

77
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,580
Gwang Mi...

78
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,000
Let's do it!

79
00:07:55,930 --> 00:08:00,810
Miss Mo Seok Hui, I think our war is about to begin.

80
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:05,120
Prosecutor Joo Tae Hyeong is in charge of the case as planned.

81
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,500
I think he's decided to do the investigation while she is in custody.

82
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:12,690
- First, make sure to block News Patch. 
 - Yes.

83
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:16,860
Prosecutor Joo Tae Hyeok's goal was to fix her haughtiness.

84
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:21,320
But six months at best? We can take care of the shares in that timeframe.

85
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:24,690
How is the green belt designation for the lands in Yongin and Yangpyeong?

86
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:27,820
They're slated to be a big city housing site on a large scale, so  a lot of local governments are involved.

87
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:30,940
I think we need to take care of it in one clean shot at the nation's Land  Minister's level.

88
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:33,120
But the Minister is not an easy person to deal with.

89
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,040
He's  incorruptible, so our tactics don't work.

90
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:38,980
- So the point? 
 - We made a dinner meeting at least.

91
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:41,170
- Good job. 
 - But the location of the meeting is a bit...

92
00:08:41,170 --> 00:08:43,900
I'll take care of that. Let's recap.

93
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:47,960
I can resolve the green belt issue while having dinner with the Land  Minister.

94
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,920
- You can stop News Patch's marijuana article. 
 - Yes.

95
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:55,160
- And you will meet with Prosecutor Joo and dissuade him from the internal investigation. 
 - Yes.

96
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:02,590
Are you going for imprisonment?

97
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:06,610
I have to go by the rules. The evidence is overwhelming, so...

98
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:09,800
Of  course. You have to follow the rules.

99
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,310
- What is it? 
 - What do you think?

100
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:14,670
Why are you so ambitious?

101
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:17,850
You have to give one when you get one.

102
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:21,740
"I'll give you Mo Seok Hui, so stop the MC Group investigation"?

103
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:24,920
Why? Not enough for you?

104
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:29,570
Giving me Mo Seok Hui is a big gesture.

105
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:32,620
I have to receive it with gratitude.

106
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,970
You're working hard.

107
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:51,830
- Don't let anyone in. 
 - Yes, sir.

108
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:00,720
You are Mo Seok Hui, right?

109
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,050
Do you acknowledge the drug charges?

110
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:05,470
Why are you here?

111
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:12,260
A prosecutor works at the Prosecutor's Office.

112
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:15,520
Then why are you here?

113
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:19,410
To an unapproachable elegant goddess

114
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:21,640
are drugs an accessory?

115
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:24,630
You must have checked my background before coming out on the date with me.

116
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:28,820
That I don't do drugs, you would know better than anyone.

117
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:32,350
So of all the people in the world, why is the person in charge

118
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:34,440
is you, Prosecutor Joo?

119
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:39,230
Well, out of the many thousands of elite prosecutors out there,

120
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:41,590
I lead in drug cases.

121
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:45,230
It's a given that the case would be forwarded to me.

122
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:47,390
You wouldn't know about that.

123
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:49,400
I'm going to do the investigation by the book.

124
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,200
But what will you do? I didn't do it.

125
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,270
Mo Seok Hui,  Prosecutor's Office sees evidence as the most crucial element,

126
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:57,800
and we have incontrovertible proof already.

127
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,890
If you feel wrong, then prove your innocence.

128
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:11,060
Let's start with a urine test.

129
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:15,440
 Seoul Central District Prosecutor's Office
Drug Crimes Investigation Team 

130
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,210
Why on earth won't you let me enter?

131
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:19,330
I will formally raise the issue.

132
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:23,310
No.  The Prosecutor said he has something personal to say.

133
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:26,680
Just a while, wait, just a while.

134
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:30,430
- Prosecutor, this is a lawyer 
 - Hello.

135
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:35,430
- Yes, I am 
 -I'm sure the chaebol are busy cleaning up.

136
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:41,010
Well, ... a lawyer does have to make a living.

137
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,350
Oh, yes.

138
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:11,870
You didn't say anything, did you?

139
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:13,610
Did you perhaps admit?

140
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:15,660
Admit what?

141
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:21,720
In our country drugs are a serious offense. It's different from America.

142
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:27,360
- Are you now thinking that I did drugs? 
 Then, it's not so?

143
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,670
How can  you  thoughtlessly  think that I am guilty?

144
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:39,860
MIss Mo Seok Hui, I've come to assist you with the urine test.

145
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:07,810
- Aren't you leaving? 
 - It's a regulation.

146
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:16,930
Wait a while.  I want to wash my face.

147
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:09,690
Fine.  Let's say what you say is correct. But there was evidence discovered at the scene.

148
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:10,920
It's fabricated.

149
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,950
Fabricated?  By whom?

150
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:14,840
Prosecutor Joo?

151
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:18,970
Why would he?

152
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:21,450
I hurt his pride.

153
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:23,860
Let's assume that's so.

154
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:27,970
How could Prosecutor Joo put drugs in your purse?

155
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:30,270
What if TOP is involved?

156
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:36,830
Thus far, there's never been any talk that she was on drugs.

157
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:41,620
How will you control a girl who is crazed like a wild horse?

158
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:49,350
Get Seok Hui out and take care of it quietly.

159
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:51,410
I can't.

160
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:53,180
The Prosecutor in charge is Joo Tae Hyeok.

161
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:55,780
That's good then. What's the issue?

162
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:59,970
I'm sorry, but we have information that he's investigating  MC Group right now.

163
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:05,250
This guy, how dare he mess with us!

164
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:06,880
Call the Chief Prosecutor right away!

165
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,940
It's different times than when we met him.

166
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:11,460
We have to use a different approach.

167
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:15,540
I think Miss hurt the Prosecutor's Joo's pride on their date.

168
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:20,210
The problem can be easily resolved if we build his pride back up.

169
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:22,300
Then did you put Seok Hui on purpose...

170
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:26,990
The reason Miss provoked Prosecutor Joo was to target  the Group.

171
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:30,240
It will turn out to be a good experience for her.

172
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:36,740
She wouldn't go all the way to jail, though. Director Han will probably take care of it before then.

173
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:41,120
Anyway, take care of it quietly so the rumors don't spread.

174
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,160
I understand.

175
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:59,850
Team Leader Lee, you need to make a move.

176
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:23,420
Who do we have here? What are you doing here?

177
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:25,100
You're the elegant sort, so you don't like places like this.

178
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:29,190
I still don't like it. Since people don't change.

179
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:35,850
I'm eating my meal alone. Get lost.

180
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:47,700
I've seen this a lot in movies. What is this?

181
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,680
Open it.

182
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:54,270
Are you paying me off?

183
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,950
Do I look like someone who can be bought with this money?

184
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,950
Too little?

185
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:03,630
Sorry for reacting in a way you might have misunderstood.

186
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,710
Tell your boss.

187
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:09,390
I'll put a nice picture of Mo Seok Hui on our site,

188
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:11,930
so don't worry too much. Okay?

189
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:15,800
Pay for my jjajangmyeon. I'll pay for the dumplings since they were complementary.

190
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,650
Wait.

191
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:33,110
You stay out. I'll take care of it.

192
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:49,960
- What is it? 
 - What are you trying to do, Sunbae?

193
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,400
If there's something you want, tell me.

194
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:54,130
There isn't anything of the kind.

195
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:58,540
Let's be honest. Do you think you can write that article about Mo Seok Hui?

196
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:00,140
You know from experience.

197
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:02,700
We've already finished talking with the Prosecution.

198
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:05,280
Why are you blabbering as if dirty tricks are something to brag about?

199
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,690
- Is losing your habit? 
 - What?

200
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:09,620
Why do you keep targeting MC when there's plenty of other news?

201
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:12,250
Is it because you want to write a correction report apology again?

202
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:16,380
While being stubborn working as someone who doesn't want to be known as a trash journalist,

203
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:17,830
what happened to you?

204
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:20,590
You're working in this tiny office with barely one reporter and--

205
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:23,310
Lee Gyeong Ah, stop.

206
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:32,690
Sunbae, when it rains, just come under the umbrella.

207
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:42,710
Have you forgotten I drank a boilermaker as your black rose? (woman who volunteers to drink for a man)

208
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:49,210
Let's have a drink. Us.

209
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:14,480
 Oh Gwang Mi, I acknowledge you as the nation's best reporter. With all my heart. 

210
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:34,270
That's...

211
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:37,130
What...

212
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:40,030
No way!

213
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:44,340
Chief, the woman who just left is Lee Gyeong Ah of MC Group, right?

214
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:46,520
Why did she come here?

215
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,460
What did you buy?

216
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,530
No way...

217
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,400
Gwang Mi.

218
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:03,740
 The Folder is Empty 

219
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:09,190
Did you sell off the Mo Seok Hui article?

220
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:12,430
It's not that. There's something you don't know.

221
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:18,700
Do you know what a sperm and a reporter have in common?

222
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:20,220
What is it?

223
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:22,690
The chances of becoming human is 1 in 2 million.

224
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:26,710
Gwang Mi, trust me. Fighting!

225
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,830
This is why you keep getting bashed as a trash journalist.

226
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:40,540
Enjoy it.

227
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:44,420
Let's eat.

228
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:51,420
There's a lot of people who don't like the smell of Cheongookjang. It's a relief you like it.

229
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,890
It's good.

230
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:58,870
This place is 30 years old.

231
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:03,260
You've been a patron for 30 years? You're very loyal.

232
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:06,450
This place is the one who has loyalty.

233
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:11,880
You know how hard it is to make the dishes taste always the same.

234
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,430
When things get old, it's kept aged,

235
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:20,630
and whatever is old, it maintains them, so I'm just thankful.

236
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:25,500
More people would be able to enjoy this if they remodeled a little, though.

237
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:28,800
It's sad that they only cater to regulars.

238
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:36,070
But the original taste seems to disappear when restaurants expand.

239
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:41,670
Just like... you, Lawyer Han.

240
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:48,270
You used to be respected as a great prosecutor once.

241
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:55,550
I'll pay for dinner.

242
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:04,890
You've been spearheading the profit margin for a Chaebol family,

243
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:08,890
so haven't you done it enough?

244
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:14,120
You've received money, honor, and power, you've gotten more than enough,

245
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:19,170
so you should use your talents for the good. So you're not embarrassed.

246
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:24,410
I see you've allowed time with me in order to give me your precious advice.

247
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:27,510
Who am I to give advice?

248
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:29,860
That's absurd.

249
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:33,240
Please excuse me.

250
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:55,320
How much is left of the Land Minister's term?

251
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:15,610
There's nothing showing in your urine sample.

252
00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:18,200
But it's takes about two weeks for the hair sample test.

253
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,780
Then continue without detention.

254
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:21,040
I can't.

255
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:24,350
There's a high chance she might flee the country.

256
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,100
TOP will guarantee her presence so investigate without detention.

257
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,830
That's for the court to decide.

258
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:32,670
Isn't it the norm in cases like this to investigate without detention?

259
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:36,990
- Every case is different. 
 - What about this case?

260
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:38,390
Stop.

261
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:41,810
Do as you wish.

262
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:46,030
It's a first-time offense, and she's sorry for what she's done,

263
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:49,310
so we believe that you will deal with it properly.

264
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:52,410
Miss, apologize to the Prosecutor.

265
00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:56,470
Director Han, I've never smoked marijuana.

266
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:59,170
Why would I apologize to that person?

267
00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:00,950
Since it happened accidentally,

268
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:04,780
so if you apologize to him and show that you're self-reflecting,

269
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:07,030
it'll end neatly.

270
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:09,280
Right, Prosecutor?

271
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:15,210
How absurd...

272
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:21,520
I'm telling you clearly. I have no intention of apologizing and I'm innocent.

273
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:25,320
Miss, you have to act mature.

274
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:27,250
Apologize?

275
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:29,700
- This is the wish of father and TOP? 
 - Yes.

276
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:33,860
But what to do? I don't intend to apologize.

277
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:37,390
Since I'm innocent.

278
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,300
Will you continue the interview with the lawyer?

279
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:45,710
No, we'll leave now.

280
00:24:58,430 --> 00:24:59,800
Let's cooperate for now.

281
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:02,020
Then we can change it to no detention.

282
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:03,720
I'll file a motion on the legality of detention tomorrow.

283
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,870
Naive...

284
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:08,460
What cooperation?

285
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:11,820
It's already been decided that I'll be detained even if I cooperate.

286
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:15,390
As soon as I apologize, it's acknowledging my guilt. Then what?

287
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:17,600
I'll be detained no matter what.

288
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:23,370
There's no way to leave by cooperating with them.

289
00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:27,120
Other than walking out by proving my innocence.

290
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:47,270
Director.

291
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:52,010
Why did you acknowledge the crime in front of the Prosecutor?

292
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:53,530
The investigation hasn't even begun.

293
00:25:53,530 --> 00:25:57,680
There was a marijuana issue in the States when she was in high school.

294
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:00,650
It's not uncommon for children from chaebol families to deviate.

295
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:03,830
On top of that, she's been living alone for a long time in the States.

296
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:07,600
And people think nothing of marijuana overseas.

297
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:11,260
- What do you think? 
 - Pardon?

298
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:12,890
About this case?

299
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:14,600
About this case. What do you think will happen?

300
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:17,930
Oh, Miss is insisting she's innocent,

301
00:26:17,930 --> 00:26:19,930
but I think it'll take some time to prove it.

302
00:26:19,930 --> 00:26:23,590
No.  It's simple.  Convince her well.

303
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:27,190
It'll be all over if she apologizes to the Prosecutor.

304
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:32,930
But if she's innocent, wouldn't proving that be more beneficial to MC?

305
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:35,120
Would it?

306
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:40,220
Yes. Truth is important to me. Besides that, I am her attorney.

307
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:42,390
Before that, you're TOP's employee.

308
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:48,580
Is uncovering the truth more important than going against the group and putting your life on the line?

309
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:51,090
Don't step out of line.

310
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:55,700
This is TOP's order:  Just convince her well.

311
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:23,080
I'll ask as your lawyer. Tell me only the truth.

312
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:25,400
Is the marijuana yours or not?

313
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,900
You're still curious about that?

314
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:32,120
Of course. As a lawyer, I have to know the truth first.

315
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:36,600
Look here, Lawyer Heo Yoon Do.

316
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:40,690
The day I got arrested,

317
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:43,860
there was a moment where my bag fell out of my hands.

318
00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:46,450
When?

319
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:55,160
 Flower &amp; Café 

320
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:58,500
When we stopped for a minute to buy flowers.

321
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,120
 Wait here. 

322
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:34,310
No?

323
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:39,500
- Wow, what nonsense? 
 - Can you prove it?

324
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:42,370
Why would I? Stop being ridiculous.

325
00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:47,030
Do you know what I realized while living under TOP's microscope?

326
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:51,240
Exactly who my enemy is, I have no way of knowing.

327
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:55,380
When I lived in the States, I even changed my housekeeper every week.

328
00:28:55,380 --> 00:29:00,970
Someone who did that momentarily forgot that you're no exception.

329
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:02,670
To me, you're a suspect, too.

330
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:06,510
Whether you believe it or not, it's up to you.

331
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:09,240
I've never used drugs.

332
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,970
This is my response.

333
00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:14,660
This is my response:  Whether you believe it or not, it's your choice.

334
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:24,630
Prove that I'm innocent.

335
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:28,340
Then I won't doubt you and it will be good for both of us.

336
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:55,530
 Is uncovering the truth more important than going against the group and putting your life on the line? 

337
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:58,680
  Prove that I'm innocent.  

338
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:02,440
 Then I won't doubt you and it will be good for both of us. 

339
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:13,670
I'm back.

340
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:17,210
Oh,  Heo Yoon Do! It's so hard to see you these days!

341
00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:18,720
Come here and have a drink.

342
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:19,830
Does it taste good?

343
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:21,560
That's why we drink.

344
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,340
- What about dinner? 
 - I ate.

345
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:26,360
Your ears didn't itch? We were complaining about you the whole time.

346
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:30,250
What about? You can dig and dig, but I'm as great as ever.

347
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:32,950
Just drink this.

348
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:35,960
I'm happily drunk today.

349
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,730
How am I? Pretty, no?

350
00:30:37,730 --> 00:30:38,890
Never mind.

351
00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:42,210
Dad, one side has been wronged.

352
00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:43,880
But if I take this person's side,

353
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,760
I'll get cut. What would you do?

354
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,300
Thi- this side is the one who's been wronged, no?

355
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:50,990
Of course you have to take the wronged's side.

356
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:52,390
That's what makes human a human.

357
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:54,780
I'm the idiot for asking my dad who suffers from chronic illness.

358
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:56,420
Chronic illness?

359
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:59,830
My arteries are clean, punk. I don't even have diabetes.

360
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:01,370
A severe case of compassion.

361
00:31:01,370 --> 00:31:02,810
True, true.

362
00:31:02,810 --> 00:31:05,670
You felt bad for people, so you always

363
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:07,970
co-signed and then got swindled again and again.

364
00:31:07,970 --> 00:31:11,920
Hey, those people had no other option so they did that.

365
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:15,530
Dad! So overflowing with sympathy is also called a disease.

366
00:31:15,530 --> 00:31:18,550
There's not enough time if we start talking about his sad past.

367
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:22,960
Hey! These people! Playing with me!

368
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:26,960
Hey, to add, catching two rabbits is called greed.

369
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:32,040
But the more educated you are, you need to use it for good.

370
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,890
I don't like that.

371
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:36,190
Why can't you catch two rabbits?

372
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:37,700
If you have the ability, you should!

373
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:39,830
These days, it's the age of two rabbit catching in one-shot!

374
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:42,840
Find a way to save the wronged person and keep from getting cut.

375
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:45,660
You can do that.

376
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:49,200
And you haven't even been at the company that long. Do they already want to fire you?

377
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,170
Huh? Drink up.

378
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:07,600
 I've never used drugs. 

379
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,720
 Your Honor, I didn't murder anyone! 

380
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,930
 It's not me. I feel wronged! 

381
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:14,000
 -Yoon do!
-Mom! 

382
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,690
 I didn't do it! 

383
00:32:15,690 --> 00:32:18,250
 - Mom! 
 - I didn't! 

384
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,930
 Don't step out of line. 

385
00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:40,300
 This is TOP's order. 

386
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:51,040
Just bear with it for a bit.

387
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:53,250
I'll get you out no matter what.

388
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:55,910
You're going to prove my innocence?

389
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,870
Director Han probably has a different opinion.

390
00:32:59,870 --> 00:33:04,580
Before that, you're my client.

391
00:33:09,690 --> 00:33:12,010
Now you sound like a lawyer.

392
00:33:25,650 --> 00:33:28,680
Prosecutor, we received the arrest warrant.

393
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:30,680
Okay.

394
00:33:31,890 --> 00:33:34,000
She's tough.

395
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:38,090
Let's see if she can keep it up after receiving this.

396
00:33:48,850 --> 00:33:52,040
It hurts me to think about how you will suffer.

397
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:55,180
I feel like I'm going to tear up from so much gratitude.

398
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:58,400
Could you sleep in the same cell with criminals?

399
00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:02,680
If you apologize now, I'll let you leave without detention.

400
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:05,610
For whose benefit would I apologize? No?

401
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:08,790
You could go to jail instead of the detention center.

402
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:11,570
You're aware of the difference, right?

403
00:34:12,210 --> 00:34:15,420
One of the things on my bucket list is going to jail.

404
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:19,810
So I'm very excited.  I have a lot of interest in human rights issues.

405
00:34:19,810 --> 00:34:24,800
And on top of that, the bleached jumpsuit would look great on me.

406
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,190
Since I'm pretty.

407
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:32,900
I heard that you threatened to investigate MC Group.

408
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:35,720
Just to get an apology from me?

409
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:38,060
Don't be mistaken.

410
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:41,410
Don't be mistaken.  You'll never be able to touch MC by yourself.

411
00:34:41,410 --> 00:34:44,580
And you don't even have the balls to do that.

412
00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:51,060
Come visit me often.

413
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,420
Let's go.

414
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:09,400

00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:33,110
Before I came, I looked into your identities.

431
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:35,540
I'm the oldest so I'll speak casually.

432
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:40,650
Violence, fraud, theft.

433
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:43,120
I'm drugs. Marijuana, you know, right?

434
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,930
Then I'll formally introduce myself.

435
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:49,770
My name is Mo Seok Hui, I lived in the States for 15 years and came back not too long ago.

436
00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:54,730
An annoying prosecutor bastard locked me up, but I think he planned it with my family members.

437
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:56,580
Well, anyway, let's all get along.

438
00:37:56,580 --> 00:38:01,080
Laundry and dish washing, we can take turns, right?

439
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:03,040
Who is this fool?

440
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,930
Why would they put a druggie in our room?

441
00:38:04,930 --> 00:38:07,160
I think she's a scammer.

442
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:13,470
Silence!

443
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:16,090
- Silence! 
- Officer!

444
00:38:16,090 --> 00:38:19,230
She's weird! Officer!

445
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:25,300
Sorry.

446
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:30,210
I was annoyed, so I screamed a bit.

447
00:38:30,210 --> 00:38:33,270
Excuse me, I don't know what your story is,

448
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:37,990
but this is a place where humans live, too, so don't think about it so drastically.

449
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:40,410
Tha- that's right, Unni.

450
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,040
Please calm yourself.

 Sae Yoon Soy Bean Milk

00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:53,340
Sorry, I have a nut allergy.

453
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:56,150
We bear it and live in here even if we have our own stories to tell,

454
00:38:56,150 --> 00:38:59,370
so be tough, okay? Fighting.

455
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:04,740
I got dragged in suddenly because I couldn't pay fines,

456
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:09,120
so I don't even know what happened to my baby.

457
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:15,000
She doesn't have the child, but she cries every night because her breast keeps becoming full and it hurts.

458
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:19,720
Me? My friend of 20 years sued me for defrauding her over 1,000,000 won. ($1000)

459
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:22,420
The judge even laughed saying he couldn't believe the absurdity of it.

460
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:25,130
That money is the enemy...

461
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:29,080
I came here because of money in the end, too.

462
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:32,080
You didn't have money to pay your fines, either?

463
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:35,670
No.  The issue is I have too much.

464
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:37,290
How much do you have?

465
00:39:37,290 --> 00:39:40,230
One million? 10 million?

466
00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:46,860
If I add it all up, wouldn't it be a few billion?

467
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:51,110
I thought she was a thug but she's a total scammer!

468
00:39:51,110 --> 00:39:56,910
Hey, if you're such a great chaebol, why would you be here?

469
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:00,430
I know.

470
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:10,400
Was she wrongly sent here instead of a mental hospital?

471
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:14,760
Excuse me. You can't lie down.

472
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:17,190
Do you think she's an actress maybe?

473
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:19,290
But is she using honorifics or not?

474
00:40:19,290 --> 00:40:22,190
Her way of talking really bothers me.

475
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:49,810
I heard you spent the night at the office.

476
00:41:49,810 --> 00:41:51,960
Yes.

477
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,860
That's the right thing to do.

478
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:58,290
This white kimchi is great.

479
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,500
Father.

480
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:08,870
My movie is lacking funds, so the second half of shooting has stopped.

481
00:42:08,870 --> 00:42:12,140
If you help out a tiny bit...

482
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:19,980
If this movie does well, I could become a world-famous director.

483
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:22,080
You like The Godfather, don't you?

484
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:25,280
In it, Marlon Brando says to his son, Al Pacino,

485
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:30,890
"Keep your friends close and your enemies closer."

486
00:42:31,450 --> 00:42:34,480
I could even cast Al Pacino!

487
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:39,100
Seo Jin, say it in English for us.

488
00:42:41,470 --> 00:42:45,920
"Keep your friend close and your enemies closer."

489
00:42:53,390 --> 00:42:56,220
Hey, you're quite good at acting!

490
00:42:56,220 --> 00:43:01,160
As expected, it's in your blood. You even know an old movie like The Godfather.

491
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:03,080
Good job, kid.

492
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:05,100
You know I'm a fan of gangster movies.

493
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:08,350
Hyung, make me Al Pacino's grandson. I'll play a teenage gangster.

494
00:43:08,350 --> 00:43:09,990
And hire my mom, too.

495
00:43:09,990 --> 00:43:13,610
Oh, yeah. That would be fun!

496
00:43:13,610 --> 00:43:16,780
You have tons of great ideas!

497
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:19,380
You have your own plans!

498
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:22,620
But dad, do you really like Al Pacino?

499
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:24,360
You didn't know?

500
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:29,830
Father learned the tango and drove a convertible at one time because of Al Pacino.

501
00:43:29,830 --> 00:43:31,270
Oh, right, right!

502
00:43:31,270 --> 00:43:37,000
You were speeding with an actress sitting next to you and you nearly died after crashing into the guardrail!

503
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,660
Who was the actress that was riding next to you back--

504
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:46,340
Totally cool...

505
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:49,470
But, Hyung, don't you think Seok Hui would make a good gangster, too?

506
00:43:49,470 --> 00:43:53,670
Right? Blah, blah talkative gangster.

507
00:43:53,670 --> 00:43:56,530
You can totally imagine her character.

508
00:43:57,180 --> 00:43:59,630
By the way, where did Seok Hui go?

509
00:43:59,630 --> 00:44:01,860
- She went traveling. 
 - She went to jail.

510
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,490
Woah!

511
00:44:06,490 --> 00:44:10,330
Wow, she's so cool!

512
00:44:10,330 --> 00:44:12,560
Do you want to go, too?

513
00:44:13,550 --> 00:44:15,300
Why do you only diss me, Ajumma??

514
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:16,960
What?

515
00:44:22,930 --> 00:44:24,740
What?

516
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:27,550
Hey.

517
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:36,340
 The Prosecution this morning, on allegations of embezzlement and breach of fiduciary dut, 

518
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:41,800
 executed a search and seizure warrant  on MC Group and its subsidiaries.  

519
00:44:41,850 --> 00:44:45,620
 The Prosecution uncovered that MC Group awarded   

520
00:44:45,620 --> 00:44:49,580
 190 billion won worth of work to its subsidiaries.  

521
00:45:02,330 --> 00:45:04,070
What brings you here?

522
00:45:04,070 --> 00:45:05,710
This is a search warrant.

523
00:45:05,710 --> 00:45:10,480
If you don't comply, we'll arrest you for obstruction of justice.

524
00:45:13,950 --> 00:45:15,630
Let's go.

525
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:26,070
Yes, Chairman.

526
00:45:26,070 --> 00:45:30,020
We'll take measures as quickly as possible and call you back once we take care of it.

527
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:34,460
If Lawyer Heo had convinced Miss, a search and seizure wouldn't have happened.

528
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:36,710
I don't think Prosecutor Joo's side will back off that easily.

529
00:45:36,710 --> 00:45:40,560
Since they went as far as a search and seizure, I'm sure they want to obtain something at least.

530
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:45,740
- Show me the news. 
 - Yes.

531
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:49,860
At a club in Cheongdam-dong, a promiscuous party took place during the Club Sonamoo get together.

532
00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:53,410
The third generation of UC Group and Hankook Airline's second child and an actress are also involved.

533
00:45:53,410 --> 00:45:54,590
Anything else?

534
00:45:54,590 --> 00:45:58,440
There's info that a scammer Hong Chang Soo who has been on the run is in Hong Kong.

535
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:00,520
The newsworthiness is too weak.

536
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:03,440
Prosecutor Joo has a tendency to obsess over the spotlight.

537
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:05,570
This is too weak.

538
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:09,200
What about the incident at the vacation home in Jeju? That was a serious incident.

539
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:11,880
Why? I think Prosecutor Joo would like it.

540
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:14,250
The case involving the model Yoo Ri who committed suicide in the vacation home in Jeju,

541
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:19,000
high ranking press personnel, politicians, executives and staff members of corporations, are all involved

542
00:46:19,050 --> 00:46:23,080
and there was a public opinion that the suicide conclusion was based on a poor investigation.

543
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:25,650
It's perfect for becoming a famous prosecutor.

544
00:46:25,650 --> 00:46:28,100
Fine. Let's go with Jeju-do villa incident.

545
00:46:28,100 --> 00:46:31,030
- You two handle it.
 - Yes.

546
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:35,580
Become a butler attorney?

547
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:38,450
You know that the bar association takes disciplinary measures against butler lawyers, right?

548
00:46:38,450 --> 00:46:40,760
But still, do it as well as you can.

549
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:43,260
The one who sent the client to jail is you.

550
00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:44,790
She's too stubborn.

551
00:46:44,790 --> 00:46:49,100
If you're a lawyer, you should have done whatever it took to prevent it.

552
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:52,440
I know. I have nothing to say.

553
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:55,890
Sunbaenim, it looks like there's a problem with Seok Hui's case

554
00:46:55,890 --> 00:46:58,760
- so what about looking into it furth--
 - Never mind.

555
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:06,240
Just support her so that she can have a comfortable detention.

556
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:09,750
  T.N.  Taking advantage of the fact that there is  no limit on the number of visits made by an attorney 

557
00:47:09,750 --> 00:47:13,410
  to his client in jail, the "butler attorney" runs errands for the rich client in jail. 

558
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:18,030
 Operating Room 

559
00:47:19,350 --> 00:47:21,990
We're done.

560
00:47:23,510 --> 00:47:27,130
Prosecutor, the tone of your skin has become brighter for sure.

561
00:47:27,130 --> 00:47:31,220
After this, your jawline will be sharp.

562
00:47:31,220 --> 00:47:33,900
You can't smile yet.

563
00:47:39,050 --> 00:47:40,720
It's been paid.

564
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:42,920
Who did?

565
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:45,590
Cancel it.

566
00:47:45,590 --> 00:47:47,370
This...

567
00:47:53,150 --> 00:47:55,870
 Model Yoo Ri's suicide 

568
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:14,400
What's the reason you're giving me this?

569
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:19,680
To be honest, as a fellow woman, it was bothering me.

570
00:48:20,550 --> 00:48:24,610
I thought someone like you might want to eradicate the evil. I have high expectations.

571
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:31,400
Get on the huge case that gets a spotlight and get promoted?

572
00:48:36,020 --> 00:48:40,860
Then MC Group's investigation being stopped must be the favor...

573
00:48:40,860 --> 00:48:44,260
but I'm keeping Mo Seok Hui in detention.

574
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:45,570
Of course.

575
00:48:45,570 --> 00:48:49,340
Of course.  That's totally up to your discretion.

576
00:48:58,970 --> 00:49:00,500
Okay.

577
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:03,720
People say an apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

578
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:06,210
Prosecutor Joo is quite something.

579
00:49:06,210 --> 00:49:08,850
He's a little stiff since he takes after me.

580
00:49:08,850 --> 00:49:11,020
Please guide him well.

581
00:49:11,020 --> 00:49:14,630
Of course. He's like MC's family.

582
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:20,110
There's about six months left to the present Chief Prosecutor's term.

583
00:49:20,110 --> 00:49:23,140
We'll have to start getting ready.

584
00:49:26,070 --> 00:49:30,080
Miss will have to stay at the detention center a little longer.

585
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:33,990
Prosecutor Joo is quite stubborn!

586
00:49:33,990 --> 00:49:37,180
If it stopped MC Group from being investigated, we should be more than grateful.

587
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:38,710
What more could we wish for?

588
00:49:38,710 --> 00:49:42,090
This all happened because of Seok Hui anyway.

589
00:49:42,090 --> 00:49:44,460
You worked hard, Director Han.

590
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:46,570
Good job.

591
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:51,810
How is Seok Hui doing?

592
00:49:51,810 --> 00:49:55,300
She's no fool seeing how she provoked Prosecutor Joo expecting to go to jail.

593
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:58,260
That fool, she needs to dream something that's a possibility.

594
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:02,220
Anyway, without her, it's quiet around here.

595
00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:06,440
It won't be bad even if she stayed away a while.

596
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:09,550
What about the Land Minister?

597
00:50:10,190 --> 00:50:13,590
Oh, it'll take time, but I'll get it done.

598
00:50:13,590 --> 00:50:15,690
Why? He's picky?

599
00:50:15,690 --> 00:50:18,070
He has little experience of the world.

600
00:50:18,070 --> 00:50:20,760
He won't benefit from holding out...

601
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:23,430
People are so foolish.

602
00:50:23,430 --> 00:50:25,360
What about Father?

603
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:29,480
There are no changes thus far.

604
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:32,120
He is unconscious, so...

605
00:50:32,860 --> 00:50:36,710
He would have no idea how dangerous Seok Hui is.

606
00:50:38,610 --> 00:50:40,930
"Be careful of small signs."

607
00:50:40,930 --> 00:50:44,740
"When working on something difficult, start with the easy task".

608
00:50:44,740 --> 00:50:48,710
"If you want to do something big, start with something small.

609
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:53,030
"A river bank can fall because of mole crickets and ant tunnels."

610
00:50:53,030 --> 00:50:58,100
"More than a hundred houses can burn to ashes because of broken chimney.

611
00:51:22,150 --> 00:51:24,510
This is killer!

612
00:51:24,510 --> 00:51:26,440
Let’s eat!

613
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:27,560
Thank you for the food.

614
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:29,380
Such a capable person, thank you!

615
00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:33,100
Seriously, thank you. We’re the only ones without a high-ranking person, so we thought we were losers,

616
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:33,920
But we’re getting totally spoilt!

617
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:35,200
That's a luxury!

618
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:37,900
We’ll enjoy it!

619
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:40,020
It’s so tasty. Thank you.

620
00:51:40,020 --> 00:51:42,090
Seriously.

621
00:51:42,090 --> 00:51:44,220
What’s this?

622
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:51,650
It’s really hot. Aren't you?

623
00:51:52,450 --> 00:51:54,560
It’s fine.

624
00:52:12,690 --> 00:52:15,120
Stop faking it and work

625
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:17,320
why don’t you?

626
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:21,240
I said work.

627
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:22,740
You have to do your job!

628
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:25,440
I told you to work!

629
00:52:26,990 --> 00:52:30,160
Did I tell you or not?

630
00:52:31,290 --> 00:52:33,040
- I said... Ow!

631
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:43,530
Looky here. Where did this poop fly fly in from?

632
00:52:43,530 --> 00:52:44,680
Who are you?

633
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:45,610
I’m Mo Seoul Hui.

634
00:52:45,610 --> 00:52:47,990
Mo Seok Hui?

635
00:52:47,990 --> 00:52:49,540
Oh!

636
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:54,440
That idiot from cell 5?

637
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:58,020
But you have pretty-ish looks.

638
00:52:58,020 --> 00:53:01,420
This thing, I’ll just—

639
00:53:04,110 --> 00:53:05,170
Wait, wait!

640
00:53:05,170 --> 00:53:09,680
If you touch her one more time, I won’t leave you be.

641
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:11,740
Wait, wait.

642
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:18,540
Let’s behave.

643
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:23,100
That damn...

644
00:53:27,090 --> 00:53:28,720
This ...

645
00:53:32,770 --> 00:53:34,020
Try to grab me.

646
00:53:34,020 --> 00:53:34,880
What will you do?

647
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:37,520
Let go.

648
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:46,780
You made me bleed.

649
00:53:46,780 --> 00:53:49,120
You’re dead today.

650
00:53:52,860 --> 00:53:55,310
There’s a lot of clouds!

651
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:21,700
Don’t act up. You will die.

652
00:54:27,110 --> 00:54:30,540
Help me!

653
00:54:35,170 --> 00:54:38,960
Unni, thank you.

654
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:42,150
I ate too much chicken earlier

655
00:54:42,150 --> 00:54:45,420
so my breasts swelled up.

656
00:54:46,170 --> 00:54:50,360
I don’t know if Soo Yeong is well or not...

657
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:58,880
  Prosecution,  MC Group cleared of all charges 

658
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:04,560
The whole country’s abuzz with the news of the model who died by suicide in Jeju-do.

659
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:07,900
The story about MC Group has disappeared.

660
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:11,990
But then again, there’s no way for Prosecutor Joo to handle Director Han by himself.

661
00:55:11,990 --> 00:55:15,370
But Miss, your face....

662
00:55:17,310 --> 00:55:19,020
It’s nothing.

663
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:23,620
Miss, TOP will use this chance to send you to jail.

664
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:25,500
I’ll get out.

665
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:27,300
- How?   
 - Since I’m innocent.

666
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:29,720
They make up crimes that haven’t even been committed.

667
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:32,780
I’ll take care of my own issues.

668
00:55:32,780 --> 00:55:34,530
How is Grandpa?

669
00:55:34,530 --> 00:55:37,020
No change yet...

670
00:55:47,100 --> 00:55:51,600
- Has TOP really decided to send her to jail? 
 - I'm sorry.

671
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:56,180
You’re supposed to be her lawyer. Until when are you going to neglect her?

672
00:55:56,180 --> 00:55:59,450
Is there really no way to get her out?

673
00:55:59,450 --> 00:56:00,560
I’ll try my best.

674
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:05,200
Go and take a look at her face and see if you can say that without a care.

675
00:56:16,390 --> 00:56:18,300
Being a high ranking person is a good thing.

676
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:20,790
I can meet with my lawyer one time after another.

677
00:56:20,790 --> 00:56:22,530
What’s the matter with your face?

678
00:56:22,530 --> 00:56:23,900
Why? Do I look cool?

679
00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:26,990
Did you fight? Is somebody bothering you?

680
00:56:26,990 --> 00:56:29,790
No. Who would bother me?

681
00:56:29,790 --> 00:56:33,950
Let’s say it’s a medal for coming into the detention center.

682
00:56:33,950 --> 00:56:36,000
I like this scar.

683
00:56:37,610 --> 00:56:41,710
On the day when you were arrested without warrant, did you check your bag at home?

684
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:45,100
Of course. Nothing was in there.

685
00:56:50,290 --> 00:56:53,560
Then after you got out of the house, did you hold the bag the entire time?

686
00:56:53,560 --> 00:56:55,770
When I was in the fitting room at the clothing store.

687
00:56:55,770 --> 00:56:58,840
I left the bag outside.

688
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:04,280
Then someone must have put marijuana in your bag at the clothing store.

689
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:07,900
On that day, at that time, how would that person know you'd be in the store?

690
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:10,940
It must have been in the scenario.

691
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:15,520
I needed to see my mom but had no appropriate clothing.

692
00:57:16,980 --> 00:57:19,220
 What are you doing Miss? 

693
00:57:19,220 --> 00:57:22,990
 I need to see mom, but I have nothing to wear. 

694
00:57:23,730 --> 00:57:30,170
 Then, can I recommend a shop that sells women's clothing and suits you well? 

695
00:57:30,170 --> 00:57:32,800
 Sure. Introduce me to the shop. 

696
00:57:33,490 --> 00:57:36,760
If the sister-in-law Baek Soo Jin introduced you to the shop,

697
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:40,760
and she knew, on the next day you would visit?

698
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:42,870
Right!

699
00:57:42,870 --> 00:57:46,700
Ok. Let me leave first.

700
00:57:46,700 --> 00:57:50,060
Lee Soo Yeong, she's 18 months old.

701
00:57:52,950 --> 00:57:57,170
Find her and take good care. It's her registration number.

702
00:57:59,930 --> 00:58:01,600
What?

703
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:26,150
Thank God.

704
00:58:26,150 --> 00:58:31,120
We were worried at this rate if we should have her adopted into another family.

705
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:34,310
Great that she has a sponsor.

706
00:58:34,310 --> 00:58:35,960
Right.

707
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:39,600
Can I take a picture quietly?

708
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:41,420
Sure.

709
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:51,670
Soo Yeong, how have you been?

710
00:58:51,670 --> 00:58:54,610
Can uncle take a picture Soo Yeong?

711
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:59,250
 It can't fit. 

712
00:58:59,250 --> 00:59:01,610
Soo Yeong, did you eat?

713
00:59:08,780 --> 00:59:10,960
This is lawyer Heo Yoon Do, and I called you.

714
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:15,960
On the day Mo Seok Hui was arrested, you kept close coverage of her, right?

715
00:59:18,030 --> 00:59:21,280
 Heo Yoon Do 

716
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:23,850
You're kidding right? TOP took it all.

717
00:59:23,850 --> 00:59:24,880
Everything you had taken?

718
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:27,530
- Every picture you took?  
 - If not, why is it not on the news?

719
00:59:27,530 --> 00:59:30,350
By the way, if you work for TOP, the info is not shared?

720
00:59:30,350 --> 00:59:34,760
Consider it good because you were going to publish a false article about her.

721
00:59:35,620 --> 00:59:39,930
Excuse me, in fact, I'm a man.

722
00:59:39,930 --> 00:59:41,930
Do you believe it?

723
00:59:43,910 --> 00:59:47,510
Ah by the way, I feel like I know you.

724
00:59:47,510 --> 00:59:51,280
Believe it or not it's up to you, but it's a fact that  Mo Seok Hui is not guilty.

725
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:53,090
Hold on.

726
00:59:54,760 --> 01:00:00,180
You can lose a boyfriend but defend your copy to the end.

727
01:00:06,260 --> 01:00:08,220
Can I do Mo Seok Hui exclusive interview?

728
01:00:08,220 --> 01:00:11,450
Of course, as many as you want.

729
01:00:11,450 --> 01:00:14,930
You can write the contract simply since you are a lawyer right?

730
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:19,100
No one can outdo a reporter! You should write it.

731
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:25,500
= Here. 
 - Okay.

732
01:00:28,770 --> 01:00:31,670
Have we met before?

733
01:00:31,670 --> 01:00:32,770
Where did you go to middle school?

734
01:00:32,770 --> 01:00:35,220
Urban area. Where exactly?

735
01:00:35,220 --> 01:00:37,020
Would this work?

736
01:00:52,970 --> 01:00:55,170
It's a throw-away method.

737
01:00:55,170 --> 01:00:56,530
Throw-away? Yes.

738
01:00:56,530 --> 01:00:58,450
When the drug ex-convicts inform against a person

739
01:00:58,450 --> 01:01:01,290
or frame someone for drug possession,

740
01:01:01,290 --> 01:01:03,210
and get a reduced sentence.

741
01:01:03,210 --> 01:01:05,280
Then this woman is a drug ex-convict too?

742
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:07,620
It's highly likely.

743
01:01:07,620 --> 01:01:09,630
She must be involved in a crime to save herself?

744
01:01:09,630 --> 01:01:13,060
If she is an ex-convict, she must be on the police druggie list?

745
01:01:13,060 --> 01:01:16,970
You should be able to know right away right?

746
01:01:17,710 --> 01:01:20,420
Ah, I'm so curious, man.

747
01:01:20,420 --> 01:01:23,420
Yoon Do, did I kill you in the previous life?

748
01:01:23,420 --> 01:01:27,530
In the previous life, I must have saved you. Do me a favor please! Please! Hyungnim.

749
01:01:28,530 --> 01:01:29,950
Go away! Go away! Don't touch me.

750
01:01:29,950 --> 01:01:31,340
Fine.

751
01:01:31,340 --> 01:01:33,920
All right. OK. Let's see.

752
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:51,420
 Pajama Party 

753
01:02:47,610 --> 01:02:49,610
Lee Mi Rae

754
01:02:53,820 --> 01:02:55,800
Did you have a good vacation?

755
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:58,730
- Who are you? 
 - Who told you to do it?

756
01:02:58,730 --> 01:03:02,200
Who...are you?

757
01:03:06,700 --> 01:03:09,680
This is a major crime.

758
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:14,240
Because of you, an innocent person is in jail.

759
01:03:15,950 --> 01:03:18,030
I won't let you suffer.

760
01:03:18,030 --> 01:03:21,670
I'll protect your identity and won't charge you with making a false accusation.

761
01:03:21,670 --> 01:03:25,380
Tell me who told you to do it.

762
01:03:26,080 --> 01:03:30,480
The lady came to see me and said I'm on the list for drug investigation.

763
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:34,360
- if I do a favor for her, she promised I won't get investigated. 
 - A woman?

764
01:03:34,360 --> 01:03:38,160
Yes. Put the drug in her bag when she goes into the fitting room.

765
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:41,240
So I put the marijuana in Mo Seok Hui's bag.

766
01:03:41,240 --> 01:03:43,550
I was wrong.

767
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:56,420
What do you want to talk to me about?

768
01:03:59,060 --> 01:04:01,730
I do.

769
01:04:04,170 --> 01:04:09,440
Lee Mi Rae has testified Baek Soo Jin put her up to it.

770
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:14,350
Why did you do it to your sister-in-law?

771
01:04:14,350 --> 01:04:18,530
Did you not plan this by yourself? Who told you to do it?

772
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:25,570
Aren't you a TOP lawyer?

773
01:04:25,570 --> 01:04:27,950
You would know...

774
01:04:28,760 --> 01:04:34,660
Hey, I have no hard feeling towards Miss.

775
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:07,390
How did you know?

776
01:05:09,300 --> 01:05:13,010
Wasn't it weird if a tip is too detailed?

777
01:05:13,010 --> 01:05:15,370
Surprised!

778
01:05:16,890 --> 01:05:21,860
The prosecutor did not investigate where the drugs came from,

779
01:05:21,860 --> 01:05:23,860
and without a warrant,

780
01:05:23,860 --> 01:05:26,960
as if you knew there was a drug.

781
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:29,770
How could the investigator know it was a drug right away?

782
01:05:29,770 --> 01:05:33,700
I will make an issue of the the poor investigation and illegal procedure.

783
01:05:33,700 --> 01:05:36,210
Issue? How?

784
01:05:36,210 --> 01:05:41,250
Prosecutor who are fooled by throw-off method? How's this title?

785
01:05:41,250 --> 01:05:45,850
Or else, an act of revenge by a prosecutor who was rejected in  match-making? This is good too!

786
01:05:45,850 --> 01:05:49,360
Lawyer Heo, you are better than I thought.

787
01:05:49,360 --> 01:05:53,120
But how are you going to prove it?

788
01:05:58,330 --> 01:05:59,330
This?

789
01:05:59,330 --> 01:06:03,390
 "If she goes into the fitting room, put it in her bag" 

790
01:06:03,390 --> 01:06:07,180
 so I put marijuana in Mo Seok Hui's bag. 

791
01:06:07,180 --> 01:06:09,450
 I was wrong. 

792
01:06:13,630 --> 01:06:17,880
This is not the prosecution declining to prosecute, it's  an exoneration.

793
01:06:22,800 --> 01:06:27,100
  Sincere correction, a clear future. 

794
01:06:44,020 --> 01:06:47,070
Soo Yeong's mom said she thanks you for the baby picture.

795
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:50,580
Must feel good that you are not placed on the list of suspects.

796
01:06:50,580 --> 01:06:52,440
Right.

797
01:06:54,460 --> 01:06:56,340
Where do you want to go?

798
01:06:56,340 --> 01:06:57,590
A hotel is good right?

799
01:06:57,600 --> 01:07:01,800
- Hotel? 
 - Yes.  I'm in a rush. Hurry.

800
01:07:07,540 --> 01:07:13,020
 I'm on fire, I'm on fire 

801
01:07:17,570 --> 01:07:22,880
  You are liar, you are liar 

802
01:07:24,980 --> 01:07:32,000


803
01:07:34,620 --> 01:07:36,730
 Graceful Family 

804
01:07:36,730 --> 01:07:38,490
Are you a lawyer or TOP's employee?

805
01:07:38,490 --> 01:07:40,130
Heo Yoon Do, you are fired.

806
01:07:40,130 --> 01:07:41,310
Seok Hui got out?

807
01:07:41,310 --> 01:07:44,500
Director Han must be really stressed out because it wasn't her plan.

808
01:07:44,500 --> 01:07:46,090
What we had agreed upon is illegal.

809
01:07:46,090 --> 01:07:50,470
The difference between legal and illegal? TOP can do anything.

810
01:07:50,470 --> 01:07:54,280
I hope Chairman Wang, the founder of MC Group, is getting better!

811
01:07:54,280 --> 01:07:55,360
Cheers!

812
01:07:55,360 --> 01:07:57,380
You're going to be the biggest shareholder tomorrow.

813
01:07:57,380 --> 01:08:00,230
Can you beat CEO Mo Cheol Hui?

814
01:08:00,230 --> 01:08:05,030
To defeat them, I might need to play dirtier.
