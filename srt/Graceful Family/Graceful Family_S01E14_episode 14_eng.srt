 Graceful Family 

6
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,400
 Today, at 1 PM, at the main office,
     

7
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,190
 there will be an executive meeting over entering the European market. 

8
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:41,560
 After the meeting, around 2 PM, 

9
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:44,300
 from there, you can leave for the gathering at the MC Art Museum. 

10
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:46,340
 I got it. 

11
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:50,190
 And Madame, today is your first public schedule. 

12
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:53,720
 At 11, there's an opening ceremony for the MC Art Museum, 

13
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,560
 and from 1 to 5 PM is the VIP party. 

14
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,930
 How much press is coming to today's event?  

15
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:01,020
 Today's event will be closed to the public. 

16
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,320
 Why?  

17
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:06,620
 The divorce hasn't been finalized yet, 

18
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:10,940
 so if you're to be revealed to the public, it won't be good for the company's image.  

19
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:13,420
 Exactly how long must I wait? 

20
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:16,090
 It'll be resolved soon. 

21
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:21,660
 Director Han, make Seok Hui's mom sign the divorce papers!  

22
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:24,990
 Don't worry about it and just go do your work. 

23
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:36,390
 Jae Rim 

24
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,340
 You leave, too.  

25
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:43,400
 Who is the call from? 

26
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:54,970


27
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:02,120
 Yes. Your voice isn't good. Are you sick somewhere? 

28
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,910
 I can't get in touch with father-in-law, so I was worried.  

29
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:09,910
 He's on a long business trip. Take care of your own health first. 

30
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:12,730
 How about going for a walk to clear out your mind? 

31
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:16,660
 I'm going out to see a movie with Seok Hui tonight anyway. 

32
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:20,910
 Good. I'll stop by sometime. 

33
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,360
 His first wife and the mother of his children... 

34
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,080
  He was in conflict between two women.  

35
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,680
  But at some point, he had to make a decision.  

36
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:41,180
  Father, were you really going to handover the company to Seok Hui? 

37
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:47,990
  Even if she’s the direct descendent of the same blood who was born in the main house, I can’t permit it.  

38
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:52,690
  i’m going to divorce Seok Hui’s mom.  

39
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:06,440
  Father's funeral and nursing the Chairman,  

40
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:09,420
  you’re working very hard.  

41
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:11,360
  Was anything lacking at the funeral?  

42
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,860
  Thanks to you, everything went well.  

43
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,700
  Call me anytime if there’s something you need.  

44
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:33,350
  Let’s go to Seok Hui’s house.  

45
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,970
  Chairman, sir, you’re late for the art museum event.   

46
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:44,920
  I’m already late. If I brought her a present, wouldn’t my wife be happy?  

47
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:49,400
  He decided to part ways with his wife,  

48
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:54,120
  but what if his wife never wanted to?  

49
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:17,350
  A conflict between a husband and wife who are in a strained relationship can bring about big trouble.  

50
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:24,220
    
 Send Seok Hui away to the States.  

51
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:26,750
  I will do.  

52
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:32,220
  But the prosecutor in charge requested her witness testimony.  

53
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:34,960
  And what are your thoughts?  

54
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:39,110
  I think it would be better to respond if we’re to close out the case quickly. 

55
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:41,800
  She must be very shocked. 

56
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:46,140
  I’ll proceed with it after checking her state of mind.  

57
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:53,510
  Today, Madame will be cremated.  

58
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:59,180
  Must we omit the funeral?  

59
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:01,020
  Yes.  

60
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:03,770
  There was an autopsy of the body as a formality,  

61
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:07,640
  and it’s best to cremate it as soon as possible.  

62
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,640
  I got it.  

63
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:18,500
  In a way that’s too brutal for anyone to have imagined.  

64
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:27,980
 Graceful Family 
 Episode 14 

65
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:32,760
 Episode 14  
 You have the right to remain silent

66
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,950
and you have the right to receive the assistance of a lawyer.

67
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:58,120
Prepare follow-up measures.

68
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,470
I understand.

69
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:01,130
Let’s go.

70
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:25,630
Oh, by the way, I’ll take my leave of absence.

71
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,490
Heo Yoon Do.

72
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:36,360
I’m still TOP’s employee. I can’t be absent without notice.

73
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:41,010
Work hard.

74
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,540
What is this?

75
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,370
Things are going strangely.

76
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:51,600
They must have applied for an arrest warrant.

77
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:55,140
Find out which prosecutor submitted the warrant and get ready to file a motion to review the legality of detention.

78
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:57,030
Understood.

79
00:06:57,030 --> 00:07:01,140
(  After initial arrest, a judge decides whether investigation can proceed with or without detention. )

80
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:13,170
Director Han Je Gook, do you admit to the criminal charges?

81
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:17,660
Please say something! Do you admit it? Yes?

82
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,350
Yes!

83
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:28,390
Did the Chairman have knowledge of this?

84
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:41,000
 Director Han Je Gook of MC Group arrested without warrant on charges of coercion ... 

85
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:49,320
Go directly to the prosecutor's office.

86
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,690
Is it Joo Hyeong Il Chief Prosecutor?

87
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:58,120
 MC Group Executive Director Han Je Gook was arrested without a warrant 

88
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:01,470
 on charges of coercion and interference with business using computers and other means. 

89
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:05,500
 Supported by huge funds, the managing director of TOP, is accused of controlling public opinion. 

90
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,970
Director Han was taken into custody?

91
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:10,600
Is that your doing?

92
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,150
Turn it off.

93
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:18,350
Father, what exactly is this?

94
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,920
Call Team Leader Yoon.

95
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,210
Yes, understood.

96
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:54,080
This is crazy, this is crazy.

97
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,230
What on earth is going on right now? Uh?

98
00:08:56,230 --> 00:09:00,840
Who could stop the mighty waves of the Yangtze River flowing like this?

99
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,920
It looks like you're so happy about that you'd throw a party!

100
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:10,890
Mother... variables always come up.

101
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:14,400
What's important is how you deal with them. Don't worry.

102
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:19,020
Right. If my Wan Joon is saying so, then that is so.

103
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,390
What are you going to do? Your right-hand woman just went down.

104
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,900
Team Leader Yoon is entering.

105
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:57,010
What happened?

106
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:59,600
It seems to be the work of Chief Prosecutor Joo.

107
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:03,450
Chief Prosecutor Joo, you say...

108
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:05,570
He wants to bury the murder case,

109
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:09,450
and take down Director Han instead?

110
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:16,530
For our MC... it doesn't like such a bad situation.

111
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:21,860
Director Han, who loves MC Group more than me...

112
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:25,030
her loyalty will finally start to shine.

113
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:35,370
We should now discretely start to make a new TOP.

114
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:43,160
Put up a new project proposal for TOP. Go now.

115
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,600
Director Han...

116
00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:06,590
MC Group is my and our family’s empire.

117
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:20,200
Is Team Leader Hwang still not here?

118
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,300
He’s running around the neighborhood to locate Judge Lee as if he’s catching lice.

119
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,340
Fine.

120
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:27,270
Here's the list of judges who are in charge.

121
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:29,770
They’re mostly our people.

122
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:32,960
- It’s hard to find people who aren’t, to be honest. 
 - That's the case.

123
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:37,720
In case of an issuance of an arrest warrant, I've prepared in advance request documents for unlawful detention.

124
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,930
Vice Chairman is entering.

125
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:52,960
What is TOP's counterplan to Director Han's position?

126
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,820
She'll be back to work soon.

127
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,870
It's nice that we think the same way. And the possibility?

128
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:01,610
We have to make it 100% no matter what.

129
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:05,370
Spoken like Director Han's juniors. Work hard.

130
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,510
So, you were Lawyer Heo.

131
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:16,350
Yes.

132
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:19,950
Miss has complimented you a lot.

133
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,770
In the future you need to help the Miss and lead MC group.

134
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:31,900
Do you feel more at ease now?

135
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:36,030
Our Prosecutor worked really hard for this. You should have a drink.

136
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:39,550
I am honored.

137
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:51,040
When will Director Han's arrest warrant be out?

138
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,070
Since the judge who'll be issuing the warrant is

139
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:57,010
a junior from my hometown, it will go well.

140
00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:00,910
It's going to come out soon.

141
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:02,990
What about the decision to appoint you as the prosecutor general?

142
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,500
That's the most important.

143
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,130
The decision has already been made internally.

144
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:10,470
The result will probably be out after two days.

145
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:13,060
It is all because of you all.

146
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:15,170
Let's do a toast.

147
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:27,420
And about your mother, there will be an action soon.

148
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:31,310
For the past 15 years, she was a model prisoner.

149
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:35,640
She meets all the criteria for her parole and she should be out soon.

150
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:40,350
I’m not sure. She believes honor is important.

151
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:43,760
Whether she’ll like getting out of prison without having her name cleared,

152
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,350
it’s worrisome as her son.

153
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:50,530
To some people, one's innocence

154
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:53,410
is more important than their life.

155
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:58,290
Just because someone is poor and weak, it doesn’t mean they don’t have honor.

156
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,950
You should forget your past now.

157
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:09,720
Of course, it's of no benefit to MC Group.

158
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:13,180
Thank you for looking out for us in these various ways.

159
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:19,820
We've gotten onto the same boat now.

160
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:23,010
Let's have a drink.

161
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:45,090
I guess I have to learn about the world and people.

162
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:49,550
About how people are so shameless.

163
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:54,790
And how greedy they can be

164
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,760
and how cruel they can be.

165
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:02,680
They always exceed my expectations.

166
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:18,720
Lawyer Heo,

167
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:24,780
You did well bearing it.

168
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:29,910
It is almost time to let out all their dirty deeds.

169
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:42,630
You coming to me was my luck.

170
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:07,880
It's awkward meeting you here like this.

171
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:11,140
Mo Seok Hui and Lawyer Heo too,

172
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:12,710
are you guys playing around with the prosecutor's office?

173
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:15,500
We can only play around with you if you allow it.

174
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:20,200
This prosecutors' organization that you work for is that kind of place.

175
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,540
So?

176
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:28,920
You have some pretty diverse charges. Mo Wan Soo's is coercion,

177
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:33,760
and Mo Seok Hui has accused you of interference with business using a computer and other devices.

178
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,810
Mo Wan Soo?

179
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,890
Well this is interesting.

180
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,800
Yeah, how did it turn out? The result?

181
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:50,620
I got it.

182
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:58,150
Your arrest warrant is out Director Han.

183
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,980
I guess you are going to have a hard time.

184
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:18,730
She's having a conference with her attorney.

185
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,690
Have your conversation.

186
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:37,000
Your arrest warrant came out didn't it? We will submit a challenge right away.

187
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,120
Please wait a little.

188
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:42,750
Last night the Chief Prosecutor Joo's car came to the residence.

189
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:45,770
This looks like the Chairman and the Prosecutor's doing.

190
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:50,310
No, this is Mo Seok Hui's doing.

191
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:54,610
She used Mo Wan Soo to goad the chairman

192
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:57,610
and also got the Chief Prosecutor Joo by the ankles.

193
00:17:57,650 --> 00:18:02,530
Now she and Heo Yoon Do will request  the murder's retrial.

194
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:04,840
Search for Judge Lee and send him to abroad.

195
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:08,860
And find out which court will be assigned the motion for retrial.

196
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:11,640
- As soon as you've confirmed it, meet with Chief Prosecutor Joo. 
 - I will.

197
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:17,480
Make Chief Prosecutor Joo, who was betrayed by Mo Seok Hui, take care of this arrest warrant.

198
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,470
- Yes. 
 - Leave.

199
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:22,070
I understand.

200
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:44,340
Finally Director Han's arrest warrant is out!

201
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,900
We finally caught the great Director Han!

202
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:51,340
Okay, Director Han will go to prison. So is it now Chief Prosecutor Joo and MC Group's turn?

203
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:54,620
I know. I'm getting true revenge from 15 years ago!

204
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:57,030
But for some reason, I don't feel settled.

205
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:59,130
I want to take Director Han and...

206
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:01,520
- Gwang Mi, take care of this. 
 - What do you want me to do with this?

207
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,720
Bite it. Strangle it. Crumple it up.

208
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,210
Crumple it. Good.

209
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:11,520
We need to strangle it.

210
00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:17,120
The day after tomorrow, the Chief Prosecutor Joo will be appointed to Prosecutor General.

211
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,160
Today we will quietly submit our appeal for a retrial,

212
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,320
and tomorrow we will reveal this case on a wide scale.

213
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,490
Okay.

214
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:26,370
Okay, we'll go over this one last time.

215
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:29,960
This is the CCTV from the day of the murder.

216
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:33,490
And this is the log of evidence that the police handed over to the prosecutors' office.

217
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:35,660
The omission of evidence by the prosecutors' office that claimed there was no CCTV,

218
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:38,870
this is the evidence that they tampered with evidence.

219
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:42,690
This is Judge Lee's testimony that he lobbied by MC Group.

220
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:46,560
We also have Doctor Seol's testimony that she received orders from one of the suspects,

221
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:50,740
Ha Yeong Seo, to administer drugs to Ahn Jae Rim.

222
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:52,510
And we even have proof that Mo Wan Joon, another one of the suspects,

223
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:56,810
had plenty of motive to kill Ahn Jae Rim.

224
00:19:56,810 --> 00:19:59,320
Let's arrange the press conference for tomorrow and please prepare Judge Lee.

225
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,860
Okay, don't worry about it.

226
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:04,980
Okay, now all we have to do is go and submit this request for a retrial.

227
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,440
Let's go.

228
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,430
Why are you doing this?

229
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:19,220
We need to be sticking together from now on.

230
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:21,010
I'm going to be throwing a bomb into my household tomorrow.

231
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:24,330
Don't you think I have to keep myself safe until then?

232
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:27,460
Just know that I'm going to be staying at your house tonight.

233
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:31,200
- You should now be protecting my life. 
 - Yes, I should.

234
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:35,070
You see, I can't live being indebted to anyone.

235
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:37,550
Let's go. We'll be leaving.

236
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:46,560
Gwang Mi. There's something weird going on with those two.

237
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:49,460
Eh, they're probably just co-workers.

238
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:54,510
No, no, I'm getting a certain feeling.  Should I revive my expertise and go lie in wait?

239
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:58,080
After we submit the request for a retrial and finish up this case, try lying in wait.

240
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,770
But Gwang Mi, isn't there something you are craving right before this uprising?

241
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:03,790
There is.

242
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:08,200
- Let's. Go. Eat. Meat. 
 - Let's pay separately.

243
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:12,340
- Separately? 
 - No, Detective Oh will pay.

244
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:18,070
Aaayyy, that is not it.

245
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:21,690
Reporters, this is not right.

246
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:33,260
You finished filing your request for a retrial, and tomorrow you're going to do something huge you said.

247
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:36,080
This is  your father's heart.

248
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,890
It's a real start from now on.

249
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:39,740
The other side is still a really difficult opponent.

250
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:43,660
But could they match my son's persistence?

251
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:49,010
Even if you swallowed the police department whole, you wouldn't even burp. Isn't that so?

252
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:53,280
Of course I would burp. You can't exaggerate just because I'm your son.

253
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,810
Hey, there's an old saying.

254
00:21:55,810 --> 00:22:01,760
You can find things to brag about your own child for three years, and you can expand on someone else's kid's flaws for six years.

255
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:08,300
Oh, Miss Seok Hui, thank you.

256
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:12,080
There's a saying that you need a stick to raise up a carrying frame.

257
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,800
The reason Yoon Do made it till here,

258
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,720
is because you were with him.

259
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,800
Lawyer Heo and I have a mutual win-win relationship.

260
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:29,600
Well, even if it's win-win, I'm still grateful to you.

261
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:46,420
Here, son, your face is too gaunt. Here.

262
00:22:57,300 --> 00:23:00,240
Even when she eats she's pretty.

263
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:03,820
It's delicious, really good.

264
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:06,250
- Thank you for the food, Father. 
 - Sure! Here.

265
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:19,240
Father.

266
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:24,070
- She's sleeping on the floor. 
 - How would you know that? Did you sneak a peek?

267
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:27,630
What are you saying, sneak a peek? I just saw it in passing.

268
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:31,690
Miss Seok Hui might be the daughter of a rich family but she has quite good manners.

269
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:34,210
I told her to sleep comfortably on your bed,

270
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:38,790
but she said she can't use someone's bed without their permission, and that she'd sleep on the floor.

271
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:41,020
- Ah really? 
 - Yeah.

272
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:45,140
But if you lay on the floor like that... you can see every small corner of the room.

273
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:47,660
Do you have things hidden in the small corners of the room?

274
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:49,500
Ah, no, tha-...

275
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,010
Hey!

276
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:57,860
Did he hide something? I'm getting curious.

277
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:09,570
Yes!

278
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,210
What?

279
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:21,680
Ah, I, uh...  I have to change, can you step out?

280
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:25,030
Ah, is that so?

281
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:27,030
- Do you still need time? 
 - I'm done, I'm done!

282
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:34,030
I'm done, come in!

283
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:44,530
What the... You still haven't changed?

284
00:25:47,730 --> 00:25:49,540
I actually don't need to change.

285
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:52,650
I realized I've only been wearing this for a few days.

286
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:56,020
You don't change your  clothes every day?

287
00:25:56,100 --> 00:26:00,500
Changing your clothes everyday is quite unfriendly to the environment.

288
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,480
Well, there is some truth to it.

289
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:09,720
Okay, sleep well.

290
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,270
Yeah, you too.

291
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:22,090
Judge Lee Dong Joon?

292
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:26,110
What's with you people?

293
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,700
Chief Prosecutor!

294
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:51,700
Why have you blocked off all contact from TOP?

295
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:57,500
Lawyer Heo applied for a retrial of the case from 15 years ago...

296
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:02,290
The one in charge of the review of legality of confinement is Judge Yoon Soo Hui.

297
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:04,500
You'll have to act swiftly.

298
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:23,570
Yeah, Judge Yoon.

299
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:29,800
 This was orchestrated by TOP  to bring actress Choi Na Ri down, 

300
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:32,620
 Director Han threatened me, 

301
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:36,820
 saying that I should sacrifice something for MC Group. 

302
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,860
 "I'll give you the shares, so do the press conference." 

303
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:43,350
 I had  no choice but to do it under coercion. 

304
00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:49,350
With only the victim's testimony, it'll be hard to prove an effective coercion.

305
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:51,600
MC Group's eldest son Mo Wan Soo's shares

306
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:56,300
have been revised upward from a standard 2% to 10%. Wasn't that quid pro quo?

307
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:58,550
MC Group is in the middle of preparing for the succession.

308
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:05,700
Does transferring shares to the eldest son constitute some sort of offense?

309
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:10,830
How are you going to prove that this wasn't the price related to the coercion?

310
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:15,860
Let's have the court decide on the legality or not

311
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,240
and let's go to the detention center now.

312
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,360
Release Director Han.

313
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:37,340
- What? 
 - She got discharged under unlawful detention.

314
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:43,100
Let's go.

315
00:29:56,570 --> 00:29:59,440
Why did you do as you pleased and release Heo Yoon Do?

316
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,760
I have no excuse to offer.

317
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:05,340
How are you going to do now?

318
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:11,520
Director Han. We're a family that got on the same boat, so let's win this through together.

319
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:16,350
With your skills, you should be able to get a dismissal of the retrial.

320
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:20,260
The false accusation matter, I will handle it myself.

321
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:24,330
Before you get appointed as Prosecutor General,

322
00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:27,790
the murder case will be made public, though.

323
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:31,220
Director Han, you can even bring a dead person back to life.

324
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:33,330
I'm asking this of you.

325
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:42,400
Isn't teaching the bitter taste of life to the callow young our duty?

326
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:47,180
Until I give you separate instructions, don't say anything and wait.

327
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:52,980
Thank you. I'll be trusting you only.

328
00:30:55,410 --> 00:30:59,840
Your problem is that you are too impetuous, Chief Prosecutor.

329
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:28,080
Judge Lee will be boarding a plane towards USA in a moment.

330
00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:34,090
The air is nice.  It's a good day for a drive.

331
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:02,770
- Lawyer Heo! 
 - What is it?

332
00:32:02,770 --> 00:32:04,340
- There's a big problem. 
 - Why?

333
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:07,220
TOP took Judge Lee away.

334
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:09,980
He was safe until yesterday, but they must have made their move just now.

335
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:12,790
What do we do? Is there no way to get him back?

336
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:15,210
There isn't. They probably already put him aboard a plane abroad.

337
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:18,330
Argh, dammit those shitty bastards!

338
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:22,130
  MC Group's Han Je Gook released under wrongful detention. 

339
00:32:22,130 --> 00:32:24,590
Director Han got released, too!

340
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:27,710
What do we do?

341
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:29,850
We already handed out our press release...

342
00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:32,090
First, the press conference, we need to just do it.

343
00:32:32,090 --> 00:32:34,320
We have the video record of Judge Lee's testimony.

344
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:38,220
Yes, let's go straight ahead! We have enough evidence, there's no reason not to do it.

345
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:40,920
- We're starting back from square one. 
 - It's a head-on match.

346
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:43,640
Yes, let's go, go!

347
00:32:47,530 --> 00:32:49,650
15 years ago,

348
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:54,290
there was a case of MC Group daughter-in-law, Ahn Jae Rim, getting murdered.

349
00:32:54,290 --> 00:32:58,370
At the time, the culprit was revealed to be her housekeeper,

350
00:32:58,370 --> 00:33:02,780
but I have acquired evidence that this case was under obvious insufficient investigation.

351
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:07,070
Therefore, we sued Chief Prosecutor Joo Hyeong Il who was the prosecutor in charge,

352
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:08,860
and we secured various items of evidence

353
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:12,290
that then prosecutor in charge Joo Hyeong Il and MC Group conspired together,

354
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:14,580
and we filed for a retrial.

355
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,780
 The person who is currently imprisoned as the culprit, 

356
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:28,210
  is my mother, and I am her legal representative, lawyer Heo Yoon Do. 

357
00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:34,170
  Inadequate investigation of MC Group daughter-in-law's murder case 15 years prior. 

358
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:04,370
Here comes Mrs. Han.

359
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,520
Director Han.

360
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:10,280
Sorry about causing trouble.

361
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:14,140
Have a seat. Sit.

362
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:22,390
You went through a lot.

363
00:34:26,050 --> 00:34:29,060
That Chief Prosecutor Joo, that fellow...

364
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:32,720
He got swayed by those scalawags!

365
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:43,200
We have to do something somehow about Seok Hui first.

366
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:49,750
There have always been problems, and TOP exists to resolve them.

367
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:52,090
The retrial, we can get it dismissed.

368
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:55,530
We would need to minimize the damage to the company.

369
00:34:55,530 --> 00:34:57,530
You know.

370
00:34:57,530 --> 00:35:01,410
You know that I love MC more than you do.

371
00:35:01,410 --> 00:35:03,360
Of course.

372
00:35:04,330 --> 00:35:06,750
I know so well.

373
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,430
Are you not feeling well?

374
00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:14,290
No, no.

375
00:35:14,290 --> 00:35:18,160
It's because I've had a few things that have been bothering me these past few days.

376
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:25,730
But now you are here.

377
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:28,760
I put all my trust in you.

378
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,340
Welcome, Director Han!

379
00:35:53,210 --> 00:35:57,020
Director Han, that lawsuit...

380
00:35:57,020 --> 00:36:00,110
Shall we call it my trivial warning to you

381
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:04,530
for going back on your promise to give me 30% of the shares?

382
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:07,750
But I knew you would be back.

383
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:10,620
Like this with confidence!

384
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:14,500
I'll be going now.

385
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:31,810
Director Han, that lady, what does she eat?

386
00:36:31,810 --> 00:36:34,540
She makes my skin crawl...

387
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:37,850
Now that Director Han is back, getting the retrial approved will become more difficult.

388
00:36:37,850 --> 00:36:39,540
But we can't give up.

389
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:42,870
That's right. When did we ever take a million men with us before running off to war?

390
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:45,760
Right. It's a guerrilla war for us anyway.

391
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,330
Let's go for it. Go!

392
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:48,700
That's right.

393
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:51,260
Since we applied for retrial under claim of insufficient investigation,

394
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:55,380
if it gets dismissed, we can apply under another claim and keep on until it works out.

395
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:57,530
I put in a request to the prosecution for the official investigation material,

396
00:36:57,530 --> 00:37:00,270
so when we look through it we should probably find something else.

397
00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:02,570
That's right, for people with no power like us, tenacity is our weapon!

398
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:07,340
Let's keep on circulating the video of Judge Lee's testimony on social media until it works.

399
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:10,110
Seok Hui, don't be scared.

400
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:11,660
Who's scared?

401
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:15,790
I have to catch the real killer. I have so much to do.

402
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:31,520
 Wan Soo Oppa  

403
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:50,120
In the end, you came to Korea just to look into that case?

404
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:51,220
Yes.

405
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:54,110
It's already over.

406
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:55,780
No, it's only the beginning.

407
00:37:55,780 --> 00:38:01,280
Until I find the real killer, this case will never be over.

408
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:06,920
The killer has been in prison for 15 years.

409
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:10,660
Why are you saying ridiculous things and kicking up such a disturbance?

410
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:16,540
Why are you getting so riled up? Are you feeling guilty about something?

411
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:21,110
By any chance, could the killer be among our family members?

412
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:30,520
You're no longer part of the MC family.

413
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:36,940
Whether it's the truth or not, I can't keep someone who stabs their family in the back in this house!

414
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:42,620
Those words mean that the killer is one of the family members.

415
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:46,820
Director Han covered up the incident. If she's not the killer,

416
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:50,370
doesn't it mean the killer is one of our family members?

417
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:57,960
You're not family.

418
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:00,330
- Leave right this instant! 
 - I don't want to!

419
00:39:00,330 --> 00:39:02,640
Why do I have to leave?

420
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,460
This place is overflowing with suspects.

421
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:08,770
If I'm to catch the killer, I have to catch the killer here.

422
00:39:08,770 --> 00:39:13,870
I can never leave. No, I will not leave!

423
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:27,700
Are you just going to leave Seok Hui like that?

424
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:32,040
Don't act without thinking.

425
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:39,170
Just be quiet and let Director Han deal with it like you did that time before.

426
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:54,630
Mo Seok Hui.

427
00:39:56,590 --> 00:40:00,150
Look at this outrageous sister of mine.

428
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:07,110
In any case, our coup has failed.

429
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:11,250
Our coup is not over yet.

430
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:15,560
But that murder from 15 years ago.

431
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:19,060
What's the issue with that case that you're requesting a retrial?

432
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:22,350
Lawyer Heo and I think that the real killer is someone else.

433
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:24,690
Oh, really?

434
00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:28,790
Oh, I heard that Lawyer Heo is the son of the criminal.

435
00:40:28,790 --> 00:40:30,470
Yes.

436
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:34,260
But I told you that his mother isn't the real killer.

437
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:36,380
In any case,

438
00:40:38,090 --> 00:40:42,850
our Lawyer Heo must have suffered a lot.

439
00:40:42,850 --> 00:40:44,870
That goes without saying.

440
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:52,040
That's why, all the more, this retrial has to happen.

441
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:03,690
  MC TOWER  

442
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:12,310
Shall we start work?

443
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:17,500
- How is the media's response? 
 - Take a look.

444
00:41:18,870 --> 00:41:23,610
These kind of speculative reports keep on appearing. 
  Current public opinion on MC Group. 

445
00:41:23,610 --> 00:41:27,120
It seems that not only the main press, but also newspapers in the provinces are on the topic.

446
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:30,930
We also have information that it was chosen as an item for a broadcasting program chasing current affairs.

447
00:41:30,930 --> 00:41:34,540
MC Group is garnering the focus of the press.

448
00:41:37,450 --> 00:41:40,420
  "Suspicion of MC concealment of murder case." 
 "Is MC TOP team really involved in a murder case?" 

449
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:43,130
Let's open the sluice gate.

450
00:41:43,130 --> 00:41:46,670
Joo Hyeong Il's ownership of real estate, stocks, certificates of deposit,

451
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:48,380
close relationship with other businesses,

452
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:53,900
and even his women issues... Make all our material public, one by one.

453
00:41:53,950 --> 00:41:56,420
Is he the card we're throwing away?

454
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:58,500
From now on, we're starting the carpet bombing.

455
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:02,210
Increase MC Group's advertising expenses by 20% in all media.

456
00:42:02,210 --> 00:42:04,420
Yes.

457
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:06,150
Who was assigned to the retrial?

458
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:08,570
It hasn't been decided whether it will be by an en banc panel or taken care of separately.

459
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:13,100
- When it's been decided, let me know. 
 - I understand.

460
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:22,000
 Recently several corruption scandals Chief Prosecutor Joo Hyeong Il, nominee for Prosecutor General have erupted. 

461
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,420
 Chief Joo has been receiving millions of won monthly 

462
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:28,300
from K, a big entertianment investor, who runs a high end Gangnam club.

463
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:32,150
 Confimration that Chief Joo acquired shares from company A , 

464
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:35,550
  in exchange for special consideration of a case, has thrown  the proseuctor's office into turmoil. 

465
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:39,690
 It was revealed that last year Joo, responsible for the investigation of A , 

466
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:43,260
 under charges of breach of fiduciary duty and creation of a slush fund, 

467
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:46,890
  disposed of the case as a nolle prosequi in exchange for A's shares. 

468
00:42:46,890 --> 00:42:49,890
 "Chief Prosecutor Joo Hyeong Il received shares for a case." 
 "Anger of the civilians against the prosecution." 

469
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:53,250
  "Panic at the prosecution with the disclosure of corruption of the Chief Prosecutor." 

470
00:43:00,330 --> 00:43:03,270
What is the present situation?

471
00:43:03,270 --> 00:43:08,770
Yes, the issue of the murder case got completely covered by the individual corruption case of Chief Prosecutor Joo Hyeong Il.

472
00:43:08,770 --> 00:43:14,900
It seems Director Han has pointed directly at the Chief Prosecutor to throw him off the cliff.

473
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:20,760
Director Han has very technical skills when it comes to dealing with the public opinion.

474
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:25,450
Should we say it's a situation where they look at the finger, not the moon, when it's pointing to the moon?

475
00:43:25,450 --> 00:43:28,170
In professional terms, we call it a change of frame.

476
00:43:28,170 --> 00:43:33,310
MC Group quietly exits, and suddenly, the corrupt prosecutor who haphazardly covered a murder case

477
00:43:33,310 --> 00:43:39,010
became the focus, and the media is already only beating up Prosecutor Joo continuously.

478
00:43:39,010 --> 00:43:42,390
To us, that is such a relief.

479
00:43:42,390 --> 00:43:45,080
The second Young Master is entering.

480
00:43:50,250 --> 00:43:53,810
I told you not to appear in front of me.

481
00:44:07,310 --> 00:44:09,740
Bring me my meal.

482
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:11,790
Stop!

483
00:44:11,790 --> 00:44:13,920
Bring it.

484
00:44:31,630 --> 00:44:33,300
Bring his meal.

485
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:35,080
Okay.

486
00:44:37,890 --> 00:44:40,820
Son, good job.

487
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:43,690
It's an obstacle you must overcome.

488
00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:49,420
The breads are well baked today.

489
00:44:51,170 --> 00:44:53,540
Have as much as you can when it's delicious.

490
00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:58,340
There is no guarantee the life you lead will continue.

491
00:44:59,310 --> 00:45:02,170
The force of Director Han's comeback is indeed quite strong!

492
00:45:02,170 --> 00:45:05,710
- Shut  your trap! 
 - Fine.

493
00:45:06,950 --> 00:45:09,480
Have a good rest of the meal.

494
00:45:13,370 --> 00:45:17,890
Wan Joon, luck is already on your side.

495
00:45:17,890 --> 00:45:20,390
Don't worry about anything anymore.

496
00:45:39,190 --> 00:45:41,860
This way, Jin Hee.

497
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:52,760
It's been 15 years since I met you, Jin Hee.

498
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:56,220
Do you remember the day we opened the gallery?

499
00:45:56,220 --> 00:46:01,010
Of course, it was the opening day, so I remember everything.

500
00:46:01,010 --> 00:46:04,780
VIP party back then was amazing.

501
00:46:04,780 --> 00:46:08,000
So elegant and luxurious.

502
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:15,020
In fact, that day, I really liked the party guests, so I couldn't even go to the restroom.

503
00:46:15,020 --> 00:46:17,150
Remember?

504
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:20,840
Yes.

505
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:24,770
Was Chairman there till the end, too?

506
00:46:24,770 --> 00:46:28,350
Chairman didn't attend the party.

507
00:46:29,180 --> 00:46:31,350
Oh, right.

508
00:46:31,350 --> 00:46:35,220
By the way,

509
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:37,820
open this up.

510
00:46:44,810 --> 00:46:47,100
Like the mother, your daughter

511
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:51,550
can't stop studying abroad because of financial reasons.

512
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:56,690
 (Each 10 ounce gold bar is worth approximately $15,000 USD.) 

513
00:47:08,810 --> 00:47:11,280
Why? What is it?

514
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:14,680
Nothing. I'm looking for a book.

515
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:17,560
- Continue with your conversation. 
 - Okay.

516
00:47:33,830 --> 00:47:37,940
Why did Mom give to that to the gallery staff?

517
00:47:41,180 --> 00:47:48,310
 Among our family members, there won't be anyone who would be investigated as a suspect, right? 

518
00:47:48,310 --> 00:47:50,470
 Of course not.  

519
00:47:50,470 --> 00:47:54,610
 Although we have footage at the entrance from the surveillance camera,  

520
00:48:02,750 --> 00:48:07,110
Doesn't make sense. There's no way.

521
00:48:18,290 --> 00:48:22,210
Mo Wan Joon, your face is full of worry.

522
00:48:22,210 --> 00:48:26,770
Why? Is it because Seok Hui has requested  a retrial?

523
00:48:27,490 --> 00:48:30,070
200108009.

524
00:48:30,070 --> 00:48:32,750
- What are you saying? 
 - It's your school class number.

525
00:48:34,390 --> 00:48:38,300
4509, your first car number.

526
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:43,010
You cut your head at the pool during summer vacation in your first year of middle school. You received 8 stitches.

527
00:48:43,010 --> 00:48:45,270
Your swimsuit back then was navy.

528
00:48:45,270 --> 00:48:51,290
Right. I know you have great memory and belong to Mensa.

529
00:48:51,290 --> 00:48:52,880
But I asked what you're doing right now.

530
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:57,350
On August 23th, 2004, on Monday afternoon, I got a call.

531
00:48:57,350 --> 00:49:00,360
- From your best friend Yeong Pyo. 
 - Mm-hmm.

532
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:06,160
He was supposed to meet you that day, but you weren't picking up, so he called me.

533
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:11,970
That afternoon, Mo Seok Hui's mom was probably murdered?

534
00:49:14,010 --> 00:49:18,920
Where could you have been instead of meeting up with your friend?

535
00:49:25,210 --> 00:49:28,200
Are you done playing Sherlock?

536
00:49:33,110 --> 00:49:35,760
Not showing up to see my friend that day?

537
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:40,720
You must also be well aware that I have a habit of not turning up for appointments at a moment's notice.

538
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:45,370
Why? Because you are a genius Sherlock.

539
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:21,890
Father.

540
00:50:21,890 --> 00:50:25,610
Not everything that's coming out is the truth.

541
00:50:25,610 --> 00:50:28,670
MC's Director Han needs to be taken down.

542
00:50:28,670 --> 00:50:32,570
We can only stop the mad race if we take her down.

543
00:50:32,570 --> 00:50:36,600
If we let her continue,  even the mole on your foot will become news.

544
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:39,140
The stadium has already tilted...

545
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:42,290
A stadium can be built again.

546
00:50:42,290 --> 00:50:46,580
Whoever survives til the end wins.

547
00:50:48,450 --> 00:50:50,590
Director Han...

548
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:54,760
I'll make sure to take her down.

549
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:23,430
Yes, President.

550
00:51:23,430 --> 00:51:26,920
  You can't prolong it any longer. 

551
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:29,010
 Make a decision. 

552
00:51:44,180 --> 00:51:48,760
  Today, to protect the prosecution's honor  

553
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:52,470
  I'm resigning from Central District Prosecutor's Office 

554
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:58,220
  Now I'll go back to being a citizen and be thoroughly investigated. 

555
00:51:58,220 --> 00:52:01,420
 and explain everything in a calm and orderly way. 

556
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:05,020
He solved the problems he himself created.

557
00:52:05,020 --> 00:52:06,840
Since it's a fight he'll lose anyway.

558
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:09,920
- We can take a sigh of relief.
 - No.

559
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:13,140
Push harder! More!

560
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:19,210
This is the judge who's in charge of the retrial at the Central District Prosecutor's Office.

561
00:52:20,580 --> 00:52:22,320
  Central District Court retrial - Judge in charge  

562
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:24,920
I'll need to drink some wine.

563
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:28,320
- Schedule a meeting. 
 - Yes.

564
00:52:37,540 --> 00:52:40,020
Chief Prosecutor Joo has resigned presently,

565
00:52:40,020 --> 00:52:43,400
but the problem is that the murder case from 15 years ago is completely buried.

566
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:44,770
That's the power of Director Han.

567
00:52:44,770 --> 00:52:47,450
- What about the document we requested to the prosecutors' office? 
 - I haven't heard back yet.

568
00:52:47,450 --> 00:52:49,830
The case got publicized and the prosecutor in charge has resigned,

569
00:52:49,830 --> 00:52:52,550
but they still refuse to give us the material?

570
00:52:52,550 --> 00:52:55,290
This is reality.

571
00:52:55,290 --> 00:52:57,140
Then it would be hard to get the retrial approved.

572
00:52:57,140 --> 00:53:00,490
Director Han won't let it happen.

573
00:53:00,490 --> 00:53:02,740
We have no choice but to keep taking our steps.

574
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:06,810
Until the result of the retrial comes out, we need to gather more proof of Director Han's criminal actions.

575
00:53:06,810 --> 00:53:11,170
Since the case prosecutors are currently investigating is still valid.

576
00:53:11,170 --> 00:53:15,230
True. There are tons of criminal acts committed by Director Han.

577
00:53:15,230 --> 00:53:17,140
We have to keep going till it works.

578
00:53:17,140 --> 00:53:20,730
Right. The situation is calling for us to keep fighting on.

579
00:53:20,730 --> 00:53:24,690
Now, here.

580
00:53:27,050 --> 00:53:29,900
Let's go!

581
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:31,990
Let's go!

582
00:53:33,750 --> 00:53:36,900
Prosecutor Joo Hyeong Il's resignation is the number one search on all portal sites.

583
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:41,390
Of the 5 most seen news, all are about the Chief Prosecutor Joo Hyeol Il.

584
00:53:41,390 --> 00:53:46,820
Not enough. Tie in his son, Prosecutor Joo Tae Il.

585
00:53:46,820 --> 00:53:50,110
There's plenty! From the investigation of Miss' possession of marijuana

586
00:53:50,110 --> 00:53:53,060
to suspicion of aiding and abetting his father's corruption.

587
00:53:53,060 --> 00:53:55,830
And on suspicion of father and son cooperating in crime.

588
00:53:55,830 --> 00:53:58,000
Are you trying to get Prosecutor Joo Tae Hyeong to step down, too?

589
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,050
Would stripping him of his job be enough?

590
00:54:00,050 --> 00:54:04,180
The picture will only be complete if we have the two of them standing side by side in a photo lineup as suspects.

591
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:09,440
The edge of the cliff isn't the actual end.

592
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:11,880
It's can also be a new starting point.

593
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:16,100
It's only over after they fall off the cliff.

594
00:54:17,430 --> 00:54:19,340
Work hard.

595
00:54:24,210 --> 00:54:27,550
  We have news that Chief Prosecutor Joo Hyeong Il's son Joo Tae Hyeong, under suspicion of abuse of the investigation power, 

596
00:54:27,550 --> 00:54:33,080
  is to be summoned as a suspect in aiding and abetting his father's crimes. 

597
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:37,230
  If father and son prosecutors should both stand in the suspect photo lineup, it'll be an unprecedented event in the history of Korean prosecution. 

598
00:54:37,230 --> 00:54:40,370
 The prosecution is in a state of panic. 

599
00:55:14,250 --> 00:55:18,760
   Suicide of former Chief Prosecutor Joo Hyeong Il. 

600
00:55:42,050 --> 00:55:43,820
What?

601
00:56:00,330 --> 00:56:04,270
With the suicide of Chief Prosecutor Joo,

602
00:56:04,270 --> 00:56:08,360
the charges for poor investigation will be closed in regards to the absence of the accused.

603
00:56:09,070 --> 00:56:15,450
The principal agent of poor investigation is gone, so the chances have become higher that the retrial will be rejected.

604
00:56:15,450 --> 00:56:21,950
I recall Director Han telling me that TOP would be beyond my imagination in whatever they do.

605
00:56:21,950 --> 00:56:23,650
Are you afraid?

606
00:56:27,790 --> 00:56:30,540
It would be a lie if I say no.

607
00:56:32,020 --> 00:56:39,660
But Seok Hui, we need to turn this situation from evil to blessings.

608
00:56:39,660 --> 00:56:42,140
Could we do that?

609
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:46,120
We must.

610
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:55,340
  Joo Hyeong Il Central District Prosecutor Commits Suicide  

611
00:56:58,330 --> 00:57:01,170
Now, once we get the retrial rejected,

612
00:57:01,170 --> 00:57:04,930
the murder incident issue will quietly go away.

613
00:57:08,100 --> 00:57:09,810
A likelihood it will get rejected?

614
00:57:09,810 --> 00:57:12,140
I'm certain.

615
00:57:19,070 --> 00:57:21,170
You...

616
00:57:24,020 --> 00:57:28,440
are you going to insist on Wan Joon until the end? 
 - Yes.

617
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:32,750
Director Han, please reconsider.

618
00:57:32,750 --> 00:57:35,020
I'll take my leave.

619
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:13,710
  VIP room  

620
00:59:50,910 --> 00:59:56,730
From now on, I want to call you as a...

621
00:59:56,730 --> 00:59:59,700
warrior of MC Group.

622
01:00:00,380 --> 01:00:04,950
Since you've even completely sunk the murder case that once was the shackles of our household under water,

623
01:00:04,950 --> 01:00:10,480
Director Han's empire is now only going to get stronger.

624
01:00:11,710 --> 01:00:15,390
Director Han and Mo Wan Soo's empire...

625
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:20,450
Wow, doesn't it just sound cool?

626
01:00:25,830 --> 01:00:30,430
With this much tenacity, don't I also have sufficient qualifications?

627
01:00:30,430 --> 01:00:35,990
And also, nothing good could come out of going against Father either!

628
01:00:36,850 --> 01:00:40,380
If you are done, please leave.

629
01:00:50,210 --> 01:00:55,720
Director Han, you seem like a really scary person.

630
01:00:56,940 --> 01:01:01,930
You know that our family has a genuinely shameful history.

631
01:01:04,470 --> 01:01:11,390
 Grandfather had so many affairs, grandmother committed suicide after suffering from depression.  

632
01:01:12,140 --> 01:01:17,300
30 years ago, because of a child he had as a result of an affair,

633
01:01:17,300 --> 01:01:20,030
grandmother killed herself.

634
01:01:20,030 --> 01:01:24,670
But... I was always curious.

635
01:01:24,670 --> 01:01:29,710
Why is that child not showing up?

636
01:01:29,710 --> 01:01:35,020
When that person should have already jumped into the war of shares or something by now...

637
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:41,190
What I think is that...

638
01:01:46,140 --> 01:01:49,010
you took care of it.

639
01:01:56,050 --> 01:02:01,620
At this rate, don't we share a common destiny?

640
01:02:29,450 --> 01:02:34,570
 30 years ago, because of a child he had as a result of an affair, 

641
01:02:34,570 --> 01:02:37,540
 grandmother killed herself. 

642
01:02:41,850 --> 01:02:43,750
Come in.

643
01:03:03,250 --> 01:03:08,860
Why did Chairman Mo Cheol Hui and Miss Mo Seok Hui use the same syllable in their names?

644
01:03:11,950 --> 01:03:16,280
I know Miss Mo Seok Hui is the daughter of Head Chairman!

645
01:03:18,270 --> 01:03:23,040
Why did Head Chairman not tell Miss Seok Hui this?

646
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:25,670
What are you going to do to Miss again?

647
01:03:25,670 --> 01:03:30,430
Why Head Chairman was so obsessed with Miss Seok Hui...

648
01:03:30,430 --> 01:03:33,340
I was curious since a long time ago.

649
01:03:34,650 --> 01:03:38,360
I knew there would be some other reason.

650
01:03:54,420 --> 01:03:55,520
What is it?

651
01:03:55,520 --> 01:04:01,270
You said Miss Seok Hui is the fish that never gets caught even if you hold it in your arms.

652
01:04:01,270 --> 01:04:05,300
What nonsense are you speaking right now?

653
01:04:05,300 --> 01:04:07,190
It's even possible for Master Wan Soo.

654
01:04:07,190 --> 01:04:11,620
Was the reason Miss Seok Hui can never be the successor, was it also because of that?

655
01:04:11,620 --> 01:04:13,430
What?

656
01:04:13,430 --> 01:04:19,920
I thought your emotions of putting up so many barriers and disliking Miss Seok Hui was peculiar.

657
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:23,070
Was it because she's your sibling, not your child?

658
01:04:23,070 --> 01:04:26,180
What? Sibling?

659
01:04:29,060 --> 01:04:31,130
This person, seriously...

660
01:04:31,130 --> 01:04:33,690
Director Han, are you crazy?

661
01:04:33,690 --> 01:04:36,610
Housekeeper Jeong has testified.

662
01:04:38,460 --> 01:04:41,550
That Miss Seok Hui is the daughter of Head Chairman.

663
01:04:44,340 --> 01:04:48,970
Miss Seok Hui is not your daughter, Chairman.

664
01:05:04,610 --> 01:05:06,330
  When we clearly have the eldest son in the family 

665
01:05:06,330 --> 01:05:09,650
 - why Seok Hui? 
 - Why are you obsessing over the eldest son in this day and age? 

666
01:05:09,650 --> 01:05:12,710
  Seok Hui, you need to come home and study management. 

667
01:05:12,710 --> 01:05:17,340
  Grandfather, I don't think that kind of study will be fun. 

668
01:05:17,340 --> 01:05:19,420
 Seok Hui...  

669
01:05:22,940 --> 01:05:28,150
  I, Mo Wang Pyo, give all of the MC Distribution and real estate in advance to my granddaughter, Mo Seok Hui. 

670
01:05:28,150 --> 01:05:32,970
  If my granddaughter Mo Seok Hui gets into an accident or dies, all of my assets 

671
01:05:32,970 --> 01:05:36,290
  will be returned to society. 

672
01:05:36,290 --> 01:05:40,560
  I... don't think of you as my son.

 Graceful Family 

680
01:06:45,420 --> 01:06:47,530
 I wonder why father suddenly collapsed. 

681
01:06:47,530 --> 01:06:49,370
 Let's advance the inaugural ceremony for chairman. 

682
01:06:49,370 --> 01:06:52,120
 Now Mo Wan Joon's MC era is beginning? 

683
01:06:52,120 --> 01:06:53,680
 The reason you want to hold hands with us? 

684
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:56,590
 The opponent is Director Han. It's a game I must win. 

685
01:06:56,590 --> 01:06:59,300
 As long as I'm alive, this fight will never be over. 

686
01:06:59,300 --> 01:07:02,490
 The shares father took from you, aren't you interested in getting those back? 

687
01:07:02,490 --> 01:07:03,980
 What are you doing right now? 

688
01:07:03,980 --> 01:07:06,660
  I hear I'm Grandfather's daughter. 

689
01:07:06,660 --> 01:07:08,670
 Sister-in-law. 

690
01:07:08,670 --> 01:07:12,690
  In the end, wouldn't the finale be to stand in court as a plaintiff and defendant?
