1
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:28,560


2
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,530
 Graceful Family 

3
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:07,860
  Appearance from Behind  

4
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:36,250
 I'm home. 

5
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:13,870
  15 years ago, a murder happened.  

6
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,030
  Darling?  

7
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:38,850
  Darling?  

8
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,900
  Who are you?  

9
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:54,580
 - Who sent you? 
 - Prosecutor Joo Hyeong Il? 

10
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:58,310
 Your residence is not this place anymore but the Art Villa in Cheongdam-dong. 

11
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:09,470
 Your wife seems to really love the house. 

12
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:13,680
 Especially your son, he loves the spaciousness of the house. 

13
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:22,390
 Since you lost the promotion, are you going to go for the regional position? 

14
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:28,400
 Shouldn't you become the Deputy Chief Prosecutor of the Seoul Central District and follow up with the title of Attorney General? 

15
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,160
 If you work with us, it's possible. 

16
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:42,410
 Tomorrow morning, a murder case will be forwarded to you. 

17
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:46,480
 Carry out an closed doors investigation and quickly come up with an indictment. 

18
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:55,200
 Ahn Jae Rim Murder Case Report 

19
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:01,590
 The prosecutor who got a luxury villa in Gangnam and a bright future in return for concealing a murder case. 

20
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:05,920
 Honestly, I'm sure anyone would have a hard time resisting  that temptation. 

21
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:16,930
 I took care of it. 

22
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:19,730
 Yes. Rest up. 

23
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:40,580
 It was probably the first mission that the TOP team had to take care of, after it was created. 

24
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:46,090
 Graceful Family 

25
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,410
  Episode 2  

26
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:53,430
Are you okay? Are you not hurt anywhere?

27
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:57,900
What are you doing right now? Are you crazy?

28
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:00,130
You're not hurt anywhere, right?

29
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:02,050
Ask for hundreds of thousands of dollars as compensation.

30
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:04,420
I have a lot of money. Ah.

31
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:07,490
And I'm also drunk.

32
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:09,530
It counts as an attempted murder, right?

33
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:13,720
I'm going to run away now, so report a hit and run.

34
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:20,840
This lawyer will take care of compensating you for any damages.

35
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:32,950
I'm telling you, I'm guilty of DUI, attempted murder and even a hit and run.

36
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:36,210
I got caught by this man while I was trying to escape.

37
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:40,630
Excuse me Mr. Kim Doo Man, I did do a hit and run.  I drank a bottle of soju.

38
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:42,820
Your alcohol level was normal, too.

39
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:46,760
I've never seen a person who's so desperate to become a hit and run suspect.

40
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:50,340
How much do you think it costs to pay for a child's education? Including study abroad.

41
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:54,230
I have two kids. It's very expensive.

42
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:56,270
one million won is a drop in the bucket for a study abroad.

43
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:59,360
Mr. Kim Doo Man. Add another zero.

44
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,550
What? One billion won?

45
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:04,120
This is all I can give you right now.

46
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,960
MC Group will never give you more than this. Use the money

47
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,690
to hire a law firm to fight or do whatever else and start a new life.

48
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:14,200
I'm telling you to never be fooled by MC Group again.

49
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:25,330
Director Han,

50
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:28,350
I committed a DUI, attempted murder and a hit and run.

51
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:31,120
I need 1 billion won to settle, so send it.

52
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,130
Oh...

53
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:37,580
There are many reporters gathered outside right now.

54
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:40,710
Should I tell them who I am?

55
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:43,010
I'm seriously considering it.

56
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:46,300
 Transfer of one billion won.  

57
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,300
Please raise the child well.

58
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:18,160
Do you express sincerity like this?

59
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,260
Yeah. It's my style.

60
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:23,730
I see you meant it but you could have helped in a different way.

61
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:29,940
How? Do you think I can even use a penny without getting caught by Director Han?

62
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:34,950
- But why me? 
 - Because you are not an elite lawyer.

63
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:38,550
Lawyer Heo, there is no third class lawyer like you on Han Je Gook's list.

64
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:40,160
Jeez.

65
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,730
You must be smart since you are a lawyer and

66
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:46,920
you seem to have an attitude and be persistent. Especially,

67
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:49,620
that...

68
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:52,800
I liked that tacky suit.

69
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,240
What?

70
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,570
- But when did you drink alcohol? If you drink and drive, it's-- 
 - Never mind.

71
00:07:57,570 --> 00:08:02,500
I don't want to get into a tiring argument with Director Han over you, so do a good job.

72
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,580
Good luck.

73
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:07,140
What is she saying? Hey, drunk driving is..

74
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,950
Hello, this is lawyer Heo Yoon Do.

75
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:16,940
What?

76
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:24,220
Can I be informal since I am the senior in this industry?

77
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:26,210
Sure.

78
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:32,070
Miss Seok Hui is someone blows 1 billion won away because of a fiery temper she can't control.

79
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:33,620
What did you think?

80
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:36,680
I thought she had a very charming way of resolving an issue.

81
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:39,640
- When she threw away 1 billion won? 
 - You can't really say that she did.

82
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,860
How so?

83
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:45,290
Kim Doo Man will curse MC Group for the rest of his life because he has resentment toward MC Group.

84
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:50,240
I think it's money well used if he changes his mind with this.

85
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,830
How can you be so sure he will change his mind with that money?

86
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:59,060
MC Group will not exist if we are afraid of those types of  people and behave like Miss.

87
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:02,700
TOP exists because you care about public opinion, right?

88
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:06,730
Of course, but we use a different approach, not like Miss.

89
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:11,280
TOP isn't an exception to a corporation's goal to aim for maximum profit per cost.

90
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:16,890
We can't give a super car to someone like Kim Doo Man.

91
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,050
That's wrong.

92
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:23,130
Read this.

93
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:29,760
This is too much even for the internship contract.

94
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:34,880
Charging 10 times of my salary if I expose the personal life of MC family members. Well, that's possible.

95
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,060
Should be reachable 24-7, this is against the labor law.

96
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:41,190
You are her lawyer as well as her secretary.

97
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:43,770
But if there's an accident at 3 AM?

98
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:46,400
You're going to ignore it and sleep until your work day starts?

99
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,060
Ah, if so,

100
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:52,300
let's revise the phrase that there is an exception where it's under special circumstance.

101
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:56,060
I should use formal language and address her as "Miss."

102
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:58,970
- Isn't this a bit backward, too? 
 - You two take care of it,

103
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:02,490
but in a public setting, you call her Miss. That's the rule.

104
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:04,860
Yes, fine. I can do that at least.

105
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:09,440
 Salary: 160 million won. 

106
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,300
After the internship period if I continue the contract, my salary will be this large?

107
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:17,160
I will sign it.

108
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:26,820
Thank you.

109
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:30,290
  Empire  

110
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,630
I need to use the bathroom.

111
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:08,260
 When Heo Yoon Do was 16 years old 

112
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,920
 Contract Agreement 

113
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,900
  Empire  

114
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:04,020
If I sign here, what will you give me?

115
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,070
Let's see.

116
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,410
Okay.

117
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:25,400
Sign here?

118
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:33,250
Sign the hiring contract too. I'll be her lawyer.

119
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:34,620
Yes.

120
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:38,460
It's done, right?

121
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:49,760
Take care!

122
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:54,070
- How much is all this?
- Uncle!

123
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:55,800
What did you sign to get this money for?

124
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,230
Child doesn't need to know! Go away.

125
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:00,120
Go away!

126
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,270
Show me!!

127
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:05,510
What's this?

128
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:07,620
Go away!

129
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:10,030
What's this?

130
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:50,110
The salary is very high, so I think I got a little too excited.

131
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:55,030
 Heo Yoon Do 

132
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:59,870
You may be Ms. Seok Hui's lawyer, but you are part of MC Group's TOP team.

133
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:02,440
Therefore, don't forget you're my direct subordinate.

134
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:05,460
TOP needs to know everything and anything about each family member.

135
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:08,130
So reporting the Miss' schedule is a given.

136
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:11,670
You are obligated to obey and follow my order and direction.

137
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:14,360
TOP's information can't be shared with the Miss.

138
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,980
Yeah, I understand.

139
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,730
Have you finished preparing it?

140
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:25,430
These three briefcases must always be inside your car. You may use them when you need them.

141
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:32,070
This is for basic settlement.

142
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:40,890
And this is for the weekends and after hours.

143
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:43,560
Use it when you might need to take care of something with cash urgently.

144
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:46,090
Please submit a report on what you spent.

145
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,450
If you don't like it, we can change it to a car you like.

146
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:57,950
Of course, you do have to return it when you leave the job.

147
00:14:57,950 --> 00:15:00,940
No, I have no thoughts of changing it.

148
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:05,380
- Access cards for MC Group and the family residence.
-Yes.

149
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:09,150
Phone just for TOP... And a company card.

150
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,310
Why a company card?

151
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:13,830
You need to change your outfit first.

152
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:16,200
I can't even wear what I want?

153
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:19,330
TOP team is MC Group's pride.

154
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:21,600
You can't just wear anything.

155
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:25,850
Wear whatever he recommends.

156
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:27,390
While disregarding my personal preferences?

157
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:30,630
He's an expert who will make you more appealing that you yourself could,

158
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:34,600
So don't talk back. Is there anything else you want to know?

159
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:38,180
I was going to  buy a suit anyway, that's great.

160
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:41,120
Does this include a new pair of shoes too?

161
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,160
Of course.

162
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:46,860
Do I need to return all these when I resign?

163
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:49,230
Here you go, thank you.

164
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:52,560
Goodbye.

165
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,770
Welco...

166
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:03,490
Wow, who is this?

167
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:08,030
Wow, big corporation is good. You are a different man now.

168
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:11,520
It's because I have a good physique to begin with. How am I? Like a model?

169
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:14,690
Of course, you are better than the celebrities.

170
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:16,920
I'm worried they would need to retire because of me!

171
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,940
Anyway, congratulation, son!

172
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:22,290
You were singing (wishing often) about a large corporation's law firm, and you finally did it.

173
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:25,550
What did I say? I get it done when I put my mind to it!

174
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:27,260
That's right.

175
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:30,380
By the way, people say nothing in life is free.

176
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:33,570
If the treatment is good, the work must be very hard, right?

177
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:37,520
Just because they're wealthy, they won't be eating four meals. How people live are similar.

178
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,890
Don't worry Father, you know I have a specialty.

179
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:41,570
Super Adaptable!

180
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:44,830
Right. Super Adaptable.

181
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:49,850
- Did you buy anything for me?
- No.

182
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:11,260
Miss.

183
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:14,300
I need to report a few things to you.

184
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:17,770
Housekeeper Jeong,

185
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:20,770
- Could you give us a second? 
 - Ah, yes.

186
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:31,620
CEO Hwaang is still unconscious.

187
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:35,130
He doesn't know the big madame got murdered.

188
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:36,980
Really?

189
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:39,630
Watch Lawyer Yoon's movements carefully.

190
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:42,450
  Yes, I understand.  

191
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:45,630
Is housekeeper Jeong trustworthy?

192
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:47,790
I don't know what she is thinking.

193
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:53,360
But she has been taking care of the Chairman since the accident.

194
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:58,140
All the more reason why she might have be a spy.

195
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:05,400
No matter what, this time you must secure management rights for the company.

196
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:12,000
Chairman Wang has been holding it together all this time with only the determination of making you the MC Group's CEO.

197
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,340
Do you also think like this, Lawyer Yoon?

198
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:18,700
President's Wang thoughts are my thoughts.

199
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:23,100
You must become the owner of MC Group.

200
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:26,970
What's the current situation?

201
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:29,930
Other than the shares from Chairman Wang,

202
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:35,560
you need to buy extra stocks and become the biggest shareholder to be safe.

203
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:41,600
In Korea, you need to be extra careful.

204
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:45,940
For 15 years, I have lived while being cautious of TOP.

205
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:50,370
I know better than anyone how scary TOP is.

206
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:55,360
But...

207
00:18:56,290 --> 00:19:01,530
Were you perhaps the person who contacted me while I was in America?

208
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:03,460
No.

209
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:06,410
TOP has strictly regulated you,

210
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:09,380
so I didn't even know your location.

211
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:10,840
I see.

212
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,890
  Heo Yoon Do  

213
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:34,560
 Seoul District Court 
  Notice of Trial Date  

214
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:41,300
 Seoul District Court 
  Notice of Trial Date  

215
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,600
Hi Detective Oh.

216
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,390
Hey.

217
00:19:57,390 --> 00:19:59,630
I'll pour it for you.

218
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,330
I'm buying today's dinner.

219
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:14,900
- Why? 
 - I'm sorry. It's not within my abilities.

220
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:17,330
You couldn't look into the case?

221
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:20,730
I've gotten help from the prosecutor's office, but that case can't be looked at.

222
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:24,270
A murder case from 15 years ago, why can't it be looked at?

223
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:26,980
Maybe someone had influence...

224
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:29,480
- There really must be something with that case.
 - It's okay.

225
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,550
There could be other ways...

226
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:33,470
What are you talking about?

227
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:35,390
Just saying...

228
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:39,800
How is the MC group?

229
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:43,520
Will you survive among the best and the brightest?

230
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:47,640
I have to survive.

231
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:50,460
Must...

232
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:19,030
I'm going crazy.

233
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:33,340
  Mo Seok Hui  

234
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:42,790
- Hello? 
 - It's me.

235
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:45,430
- Who are you? 
 - Mo Seok Hui!

236
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:47,810
Oh, what is it?

237
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:49,900
- What does a baseless accusation means?
- What?

238
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:53,250
- What does a baseless accusation means?!
- Why...

239
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:57,040
It's when you blame and resent someone else for no reason.

240
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,640
Okay.

241
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:03,530
Seriously...

242
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:15,820
Seriously!

243
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:23,220
Mo Seok Hui, you should get some sleep in the morning, that's how you get prettier.

244
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:25,730
I can't sleep due to the jet lag.

245
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:32,250
You know how to swim, right?

246
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:49,600
♫  Hey, give it to me  ♫

247
00:22:53,890 --> 00:23:00,190
♫  Hey, give it to me  ♫

248
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:12,140
♫  I'm on fire, I'm on fire  ♫

249
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:22,360
  You are liar, you are liar  

250
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:27,730
Were you a swimmer?

251
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:30,710
No. If you weren't, what are we doing in this early morning?

252
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:32,380
In New York, it's 2 PM.

253
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:35,480
For 15 years I've done this. You can't change the habit overnight.

254
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:39,490
- Then do we have to do this every morning for your jet lag? 
 - Of course.

255
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:43,610
I can't. You should hire a part timer to be your pace maker. This is not in my job description.

256
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:47,030
True, it doesn't seem like you got proper swimming lessons.

257
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:50,120
This is so called dirt spoon (poor family) swim. Survival swim.

258
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:52,190
Anyway, let's hurry home and get some sleep. I'm tired.

259
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:55,040
- No, my day starts now. 
 - What?

260
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:58,180
Dongdaemoon market opens in the early morning right?

261
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,540
- You have low stamina, huh?  
 -   My stamina is low.

262
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:04,920
I have to go and sleep. Let's go!

263
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:09,190
- Okay! Then report to my house by 7 AM for work.
 -  Why?

264
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:13,680
Our family has an early breakfast. You have to greet them.

265
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:31,200
Ah, you scared me.

266
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,520
Where you coming from so early in the morning? And what's with your hair?

267
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:38,270
I'm tired. Let's not talk now. Wake me up in two hours.

268
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:39,570
What?

269
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:54,970
Housekeeper Park and Yoo, is the Picasso's breakfast ready?

270
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:56,630
Yes, we will get it ready.

271
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:59,110
Hurry.

272
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:11,110
Hello.

273
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:16,410
What's this? It's Picasso's meal.

274
00:25:16,410 --> 00:25:18,440
Picasso?

275
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:40,950
Ew.

276
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:43,190
It's disgusting.

277
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:45,140
Please be quiet.

278
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:47,580
Picasso is sensitive.

279
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:53,910
That goldfish is Picasso?

280
00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:58,740
Yes. It's a fish the madame adores.

281
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:23,190
Til when are we sleeping separately?

282
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:26,270
If you need a man, go outside and meet one.

283
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:28,820
Don't annoy me first thing in the morning.

284
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:30,990
You heartless bastard.

285
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:39,230
Putting up with a son of a bitch was a condition of your father becoming chancellor

286
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:43,560
and your siblings' expenses to study abroad as well as money your family can spend for the rest of their lives.

287
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:46,380
It was your choice.

288
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:49,680
Wait til the heir is decided.

289
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,920
then I'll get a divorce with you.

290
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:54,650
Hey, you're up, right?

291
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:57,150
Sister-in-law, sorry.

292
00:26:57,150 --> 00:27:02,200
He is so busy that I can't get in touch with him if not now.

293
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:07,410
Honey, excuse me.

294
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:16,810
You are so elegant at any time.

295
00:27:16,810 --> 00:27:21,790
I have been curious by the way...

296
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:24,390
why do you use a separate bed?

297
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:27,550
Is your relationship with her not good?

298
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:31,670
If we are a married couple, do we have to sync on our lifestyle too?

299
00:27:31,670 --> 00:27:34,990
It's a bed I use to read my books til late into the night. Happy?

300
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:39,380
Seriously, you need to stop reading and make a baby first.

301
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:43,270
If you just have a kid, it'll make you guys a perfect couple.

302
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:45,620
What do you want?

303
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:47,900
Make an investment.

304
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:51,900
Wow, the script this time is a killer.

305
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:54,240
I'm going to submit it to Cannes.

306
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:58,230
I don't want to. Do you know how much of my money you've wasted already?

307
00:27:58,230 --> 00:28:02,060
Seriously, why do you bring up the painful past so early in the morning?

308
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:04,560
Does it hurt at least?

309
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,250
Hey,

310
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:12,250
the moment the eldest of my family fails, we'll be in the dumps.

311
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:17,400
It's a good thing that I'm an artist since I have no greed for power.

312
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:20,930
If you're confident about your capabilities, become the successor.

313
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,760
 Title: White Bridge 

314
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,470
Hey, Wan Joon, the script--

315
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:43,820
Yes, what business do you have here?

316
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:45,820
Oh, yes.

317
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:51,910
Thank you.

318
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:22,290
CEO is coming.

319
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:38,380
- Maid 
 - Yes, Miss.

320
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:40,640
Give me steak.

321
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,870
Alright.

322
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:48,430
What? Why do you get surprised?

323
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:51,290
It's steak time in New York now.

324
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:55,130
I can't eat Picasso as sashimi first thing in the morning.

325
00:29:55,890 --> 00:29:57,700
- What? 
 - Mo Seok Hui.

326
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:01,200
I restrained myself because the step mom adores it.

327
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:07,930
Seok Hui, it's hard to get adjusted to Seoul right?

328
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:10,580
- Do you need my help?  
 - Forget it.

329
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:11,820
Why?

330
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:15,470
Oh, you found yourself a man in such a short time?

331
00:30:18,290 --> 00:30:20,540
- Bring him in. 
 - Yes.

332
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:33,250
The man standing over there is my personal lawyer.

333
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:35,730
Hello, I am Heo Yoon Do.

334
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:38,600
Oh, you've got a taste.

335
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:41,330
What are you saying? It's not my "taste".

336
00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:47,000
Wow, how did you become the lawyer of the pickiest person in the family?

337
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,420
You're quite capable.

338
00:30:50,570 --> 00:30:53,090
I welcome you for becoming MC Group's family.

339
00:30:53,090 --> 00:30:56,450
Take care of our Seok Hui.

340
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:05,160
Will you be able to do well?

341
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,940
Yes. Not sure.

342
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:09,880
Whether you keep doing this job or not

343
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:14,720
all gets decided by your salary.

344
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:18,990
I don't believe that money is always the decision-maker.

345
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:22,430
But unhappiness is decided by money.

346
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:36,120
It's lacking. Come with me.

347
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,920
Good bye.

348
00:31:57,230 --> 00:31:58,390
Much better.

349
00:31:58,390 --> 00:32:01,750
You don't need to be this kind.

350
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:07,200
Don't be mistaken. I don't like tackiness, that's all.

351
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,070
What about my work for today?

352
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:13,450
I'm going to take a break. Go to TOP.

353
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:15,620
Seriously...

354
00:32:27,090 --> 00:32:30,220
The investment in the Myanmar mine and Vietnam apartment purchase cost

355
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:32,890
are well handled.

356
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:36,030
How about MC museum picture auction?

357
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:39,460
We got the piece yesterday and went back to Israel.

358
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:42,120
We wired the purchase cost to Hong Kong corporate office.

359
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:47,370
Great. As planned, we are right on track to secure the cash.

360
00:32:47,370 --> 00:32:50,020
Need to get the Green Technology listed earlier.

361
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:51,670
Yes, I am preparing it.

362
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:55,150
Before than, don't we need to increase the frequency of press release on Mr. Mo?

363
00:32:55,150 --> 00:32:57,390
Yes, will plan for the broadcast schedule.

364
00:32:57,390 --> 00:32:58,430
Okay.

365
00:32:59,170 --> 00:33:01,600
What happened to persuading the MC distribution shareholders?

366
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:05,730
It's not easy because they are the initial members who are friends with Chairman Wang.

367
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:08,500
If so, we need to find a way to persuade them.

368
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:10,170
Understood.

369
00:33:10,170 --> 00:33:13,440
Chairman side has to purchase aditional shares and

370
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:17,030
they would need some cash to pay Miss Seok Hui's taxes.

371
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:21,430
They will sell the property in Yongin and Yangpyeong to cash out.

372
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:23,910
- We must prevent it. 
 - Yes.

373
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:29,830
Lawyer Heo is at work now.

374
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:32,420
Take good care. Ok.

375
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:37,720
Yes.

376
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:50,390
Hey, you speak English?

377
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:54,270
MC Distribution is entering into a distribution agreement in New York.

378
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:56,340
Proof read the contract.

379
00:33:57,970 --> 00:34:00,880
As soon as possible, please.

380
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:14,320
What? He's an outcast from day 1?

381
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:25,800
 The place of dispatch for the text was the base station in Seongbuk-dong. 

382
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:29,080
Who would it be from this family?

383
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:55,320
Hyung, if we release social postings on personal SNS simultaneously at 12 am, even TOP can't prevent it.

384
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:58,480
I need the assistance of the 100,000 members of your internet cafe.

385
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:01,850
I'm telling you, I won't give up on MC Group Mo Wan Joon's slush fund this time.

386
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:03,420
Yes, even so please believe me.

387
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:06,110
Right, okay.

388
00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:12,390
Manager! Manger, Manager, Manager!

389
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:19,420
The picture showing Lee Byeong Soo coming out of Choi Soo Jong's house this morning.

390
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:22,620
We've got it! We've got them now!

391
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:26,100
Unless Trump is assassinated, this is going to top the news.

392
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:28,780
This is great, right? This is amazing!

393
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:31,000
This is crazy, wow.

394
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,640
Go ahead and do more. Isn't this amazing?

395
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:36,230
Anyway, great job.

396
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:39,440
What? Why is your response so lacking?

397
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,260
How can you treat a junior who brought an exclusive like this?

398
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:46,340
Gwang Mi, you no longer have to tail celebrities anymore.

399
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:49,430
You're making me uneasy again.

400
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:52,310
There will be an article about MC Group Mo Wan Joon slush fund.

401
00:35:52,310 --> 00:35:55,570
Are you determined to have our office closed down by provoking MC Group?

402
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:57,620
Why do you keep targeting MC Group?

403
00:35:57,620 --> 00:36:01,040
I have many deep grudges against them. There is a sad story.

404
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:04,190
I must pay them  back, step by step.

405
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:07,180
I'm not interested in that history. I can't bear if my monthly pay is postponed.

406
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:08,460
Other companies want me too!

407
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:12,020
Gwang Mi, how long will you be writing crappy articles?

408
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:16,800
This time, let's screw MC over royally.  In the major league.

409
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:20,000
- Sunbae. 
 - Let's do it.

410
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:28,080
We may live differently from now on.

411
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:42,540
Ma'am. The search word, MC Group Mo Wan Joon' slush fund,

412
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:44,560
is quickly gaining popularity.

413
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:47,330
Especially on personal SNS!

414
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:48,370
Where's the source?

415
00:36:48,370 --> 00:36:50,410
We are looking into it.

416
00:36:51,530 --> 00:36:54,390
Call everyone.

417
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:12,530
CEO, it's an emergency.

418
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:17,160
There is a problem.

419
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:27,850
Green Technology that Mo Wan Joon CEO is leading,

420
00:37:27,850 --> 00:37:31,300
even when the environment business is down last year,

421
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:33,650
the company had a lucrative year.

422
00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:36,970
Green Technology is poised to bring new ICT technolgies to life in the future.

423
00:37:36,970 --> 00:37:42,390
I've heard that you will expand your search for new businesses through the complex

424
00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:45,020
Please keep up your great work.

425
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:47,450
Yes, thank you.

426
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:52,790
You worked hard.

427
00:37:52,790 --> 00:37:54,400
You worked hard too.

428
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,420
Good job, everyone! Good job!

429
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:58,990
Good job.

430
00:37:58,990 --> 00:38:01,000
Good job.

431
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:06,620
Good job.

432
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:38,380
Great. You need to be careful about the scandal.

433
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:41,660
She will be reported to the Head.

434
00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:47,110
Excuse me.

435
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:48,850
What?

436
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,730
Okay.

437
00:38:54,730 --> 00:38:58,790
- What is it? 
 - You need to leave in a hurry.

438
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,790
CEO is coming.

439
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:29,100
When you guys are paid high salaries,

440
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:33,690
that means there should be no mishaps.

441
00:39:33,690 --> 00:39:37,380
When I ride the horse these days, why do you think I use the whip?

442
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:39,400
My horse...

443
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:45,480
because it gets old, it becomes so lazy.

444
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:48,090
A whip is the best weapon for the lazy ones.

445
00:39:48,090 --> 00:39:52,590
Lazy ones are incompetent, you who waste my money

446
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:56,860
I, what should I hold?

447
00:39:56,860 --> 00:40:01,940
We will wrap this up in 3 days so there's no change in the stock price.

448
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,720
One day!

449
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,590
Okay.

450
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:28,100
 Executive Director Mo Wan Joon has consistently said he is not aware of any paper company. 

451
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:30,100
 but actually, is he speaking truthfully? 

452
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:35,020
 Mo Wan Joon ordered me to form a paper company. 

453
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:37,890
Isn't he director Park? How dare he!

454
00:40:37,890 --> 00:40:40,620
He's not home, and disappeared.

455
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:43,130
The first report came from Newspatch's Kim Boo Gi.

456
00:40:43,130 --> 00:40:46,230
- Do you know him? 
 Yes, I know him well.

457
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:48,400
He has a sharp temper and his nickname is "The Viper."

458
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:53,700
After he was fired, he was on the fringes, chasing after celebs.  People don't change.

459
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:56,440
First, take down the portal site. Connect me with CEO Choi.

460
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:57,860
We haven't been able to contact him from earlier.

461
00:40:57,860 --> 00:41:00,590
- Find his whereabouts. 
 - Ok.

462
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,990
He's in the VIP room in Samsung-dong.

463
00:41:04,990 --> 00:41:08,100
You heard her? Meet CEO Choi and handle the portal issue.

464
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:10,000
Ok.

465
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:14,810
 Chief Prosecutor Joo Hyueong Il 

466
00:41:15,730 --> 00:41:17,550
Hello, Chief Prosecutor.

467
00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:20,100
There will be an investigation from the prosecution.

468
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:22,300
A Special Issue?

469
00:41:23,930 --> 00:41:27,890
The deputy prosecutor doesn't have any options, and said okay.

470
00:41:27,890 --> 00:41:32,770
Because Prosecutor Joo Tae Hyeong will be on the team, let's wait and see for now.

471
00:41:34,330 --> 00:41:36,380
The person in charge is Prosecutor  Lee Hyeok?

472
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:38,500
We started at the same time.

473
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:41,530
We will manage the prosecutors, you take on the press.

474
00:41:41,530 --> 00:41:43,240
Yes.

475
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:45,220
Wait, what is Heo Yoon Do doing?

476
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:47,840
I asked him to do a review in English.

477
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:51,100
Tell him to find Park and ask him to come politely.

478
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:54,260
You are asking him to do it, it's important?

479
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:56,850
We will  see if he can get on it.

480
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:03,930
So...find him by 9 pm?

481
00:42:03,930 --> 00:42:06,260
Why? You can't?

482
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:07,910
No, that's not it...

483
00:42:07,910 --> 00:42:11,770
I...I don't have Park's contact..

484
00:42:11,770 --> 00:42:13,800
Here's his contact.

485
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:17,170
Good luck.

486
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:21,600
It's because he doesn't answer that he can't be found.  Give me some other source.

487
00:42:22,850 --> 00:42:24,420
No.

488
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:29,860
What does he look like.

489
00:42:35,290 --> 00:42:38,190
 Publisher Woogongyisan 

490
00:42:44,610 --> 00:42:46,450
Manager.

491
00:42:48,450 --> 00:42:50,840
You are here, what's up?

492
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:53,020
It's an emergency.

493
00:42:57,100 --> 00:43:02,070
In an hour, because we will upload multiple light articles about  Director Mo Wan Joon

494
00:43:02,070 --> 00:43:04,700
whose great build  is envied by movie actors,

495
00:43:04,730 --> 00:43:07,790
please prepare comments appealling to the younger generation.

496
00:43:07,790 --> 00:43:11,090
The network evening news will be about his volunteering at a nursing home,

497
00:43:11,090 --> 00:43:13,770
and the moving story of his sponsoring a janitor will come out.

498
00:43:13,770 --> 00:43:15,730
Shoot the program immediately.

499
00:43:15,730 --> 00:43:16,730
Yes.

500
00:43:16,730 --> 00:43:19,630
Starting tonight for several days,  the keywords in real world rankings will have

501
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:23,680
Papami ( Flawless ) Mo Wan Joon and Papami MC Group.

502
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:26,090
Wave upon wave, the moving story of Mo Wan Joon.

503
00:43:26,090 --> 00:43:29,590
I understand. I'll stay up all night finishing it.

504
00:43:29,590 --> 00:43:31,160
Hold on.

505
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:36,920
Wait a moment.  Have some snacks.

506
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:38,500
Thank you.

507
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:42,900
Listen up!  The keywords from now on are Pappami Mowanjun Pappami MC Group.

508
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:45,500
- Let's get started!! Chop chop! 
 -Yes.

509
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:50,590
The portal main article and the actual views ranking must be decreased immediately.

510
00:43:52,230 --> 00:43:56,290
I heard that MC Group has become the largest shareholder in Carlyle.

511
00:43:56,290 --> 00:44:00,770
This time Carlyle released a similar version of the game of our game.

512
00:44:00,770 --> 00:44:03,240
How did we buy our competitor's shares?

513
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:08,430
What do you think about launching a game jointly with Carlyle?

514
00:44:08,430 --> 00:44:12,140
Did Director Han drop that order?

515
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:17,400
As you know, I can't do anything without her prior consent.

516
00:44:25,190 --> 00:44:29,290
Team Leader Kim, you need to work on something.

517
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:11,410
Huh better than expected?

518
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:35,410
Yes, I'm the one who instructed

519
00:45:35,410 --> 00:45:38,540
the establishment of Mr. Mo Wan Joon's paper company.

520
00:45:43,770 --> 00:45:45,350
Hey, it's me.

521
00:45:45,350 --> 00:45:48,980
Can you help looking at the list of people staying at the hotel?

522
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:15,990
Chairman Park Young Cheol

523
00:46:18,590 --> 00:46:19,530
Who are you?

524
00:46:19,530 --> 00:46:22,000
I come from MC.

525
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:31,970
How did you know I'm here?

526
00:46:31,970 --> 00:46:35,100
Right, what can't TOP do?

527
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:38,430
Now you need to relax.

528
00:46:39,650 --> 00:46:42,640
I don't recognize your face from TOP.

529
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:44,110
I am an intern.

530
00:46:44,110 --> 00:46:46,700
What did Director Han say to you to take care of me?

531
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:49,450
Politely ask you to come to TOP.

532
00:46:49,450 --> 00:46:52,030
How can I trust Director Han?

533
00:46:52,030 --> 00:46:55,140
I know there are many security guards on the first floor.

534
00:46:55,140 --> 00:46:58,360
I am not moving a step from here.

535
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:01,890
Before I call the police, go away.

536
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:04,660
I think they will propose you something.

537
00:47:04,660 --> 00:47:05,780
A proposal?

538
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:07,910
There are 2 ways how TOP manages things.

539
00:47:07,910 --> 00:47:12,480
Either make you come to its side or ruin you.

540
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:14,450
You would be the first case.

541
00:47:14,450 --> 00:47:18,860
Director Han still thinks you are family.

542
00:47:18,860 --> 00:47:21,960
I guarantee that.

543
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:29,080
Come in.

544
00:47:37,410 --> 00:47:39,930
I've escorted him here.

545
00:47:39,930 --> 00:47:41,970
Leave.

546
00:47:45,430 --> 00:47:47,400
Sit down.

547
00:47:55,380 --> 00:47:57,750
How much do you want?

548
00:47:57,750 --> 00:48:01,510
I don't want much money,

549
00:48:01,510 --> 00:48:05,050
I thought it's the end of the world because I didn't get promoted.

550
00:48:05,050 --> 00:48:09,180
I worked here for decades, I was upset.

551
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:14,210
Anyway, I am thankful you being so considerate.

552
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:19,120
Is it all ready?  Bring it here.

553
00:48:33,650 --> 00:48:37,700
  I don't want much money,    

554
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:43,000
 I thought it's the end of the world because I didn't get promoted. For decades . 

555
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:45,200
Upload it as a rebuttal to "On-the-Spot Issue."

556
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:47,840
Yes.

557
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:51,770
Hey, Director Han. Why are you doing this to me?

558
00:48:51,770 --> 00:48:53,660
This is not what you promised.

559
00:48:53,660 --> 00:48:55,740
I didn't make any promise.

560
00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:57,410
What?

561
00:48:58,710 --> 00:49:01,580
Hey intern, you said so.

562
00:49:01,580 --> 00:49:04,400
Say something.

563
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:09,000
I brought him here to negotiate.

564
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:12,520
You lost your mind, how would you dare to believe an intern?

565
00:49:16,810 --> 00:49:19,650
You leaked inside information while working as an employee, and on top of that it was false.

566
00:49:19,650 --> 00:49:22,510
And you also asked for payment, so adding onto that blackmail,

567
00:49:22,510 --> 00:49:25,630
there's sufficient reason to ask for compensation for damages.

568
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:28,870
I mean....

569
00:49:28,870 --> 00:49:33,120
I'm sorry, please spare me this once.

570
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:35,260
It's all my fault.

571
00:49:35,260 --> 00:49:36,240
Get rid of him.

572
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:38,790
Director Han, I'm so sorry.

573
00:49:38,790 --> 00:49:40,640
I was wrong.

574
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:43,230
Director Han ...

575
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:46,500
I...I am sorry. Forgive me!

576
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:48,790
I was wrong.

577
00:49:48,790 --> 00:49:50,710
No!

578
00:49:57,270 --> 00:49:59,110
You worked hard.

579
00:50:12,940 --> 00:50:15,860
Did you have to go so far?

580
00:50:18,060 --> 00:50:21,600
It's MC's policy that there is no mercy for the betrayers.

581
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:23,460
I am suddenly a liar.

582
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:25,590
I see that as your occupational qualification.

583
00:50:25,590 --> 00:50:29,610
Even if you are a killer, if you have a skill, it's my rule to recruit you.

584
00:50:29,610 --> 00:50:31,480
Still, suing him is too much.

585
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:35,660
Not at all.  There is a difference in what people will tolerate.

586
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:40,550
I...am not short-tempered.but I am somewhat impatient.

587
00:50:45,890 --> 00:50:48,340
Great outfit!

588
00:50:49,730 --> 00:50:53,500
By the way,  this is the ladies' room.

589
00:50:57,810 --> 00:50:59,900
  Come home.  

590
00:51:08,510 --> 00:51:09,950
You came?

591
00:51:09,950 --> 00:51:11,750
Sit down.

592
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:14,690
What is it?

593
00:51:21,060 --> 00:51:25,650
Not even 12 hours after the news broke, "On-the-Spot Issue" became fake news.

594
00:51:25,650 --> 00:51:28,810
And the prosecutors said they wouldn't lay a finger on the investigation of MC Group.

595
00:51:28,810 --> 00:51:34,630
And the internet is all a buzz calling Mo Han Joon an angel like no other.

596
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:37,740
Isn't TOP amazing?

597
00:51:37,740 --> 00:51:40,260
Of course, lawyer Heo did your part.

598
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:43,850
What? How do you know my schedule?

599
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:49,990
Did you eavesdrop on me?

600
00:51:59,180 --> 00:52:01,160
You made me a spy, you know?

601
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:03,520
Don't exaggerate,   I eavesdropped the meeting a bit. So what?

602
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:05,340
I'll get sued if TOP knows I got eavesdropped on.

603
00:52:05,340 --> 00:52:08,840
I thought you knew but were pretending not to.

604
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:09,980
I was thinking you were on my side.

605
00:52:09,980 --> 00:52:12,950
No. I'm not on anyone's side.

606
00:52:12,950 --> 00:52:15,420
Did you by chance pick me to fight against TOP?

607
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:16,960
- Then it's a fail.
 - Why?

608
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:19,180
I'm not going to live as a second-rate lawyer anymore.

609
00:52:19,180 --> 00:52:22,240
I will finish my internship and make it to the full timer.

610
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:26,160
I'm your lawyer now, but I get paid from TOP.

611
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:29,330
Yeah? Thank you for letting me know.

612
00:52:29,330 --> 00:52:33,180
I don't know why you eavesdropped on me, but I don't agree.

613
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:39,620
Do you think everyone at TOP is on equal footing?

614
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:45,900
Become a real member of TOP that you don't even know about.

615
00:52:52,650 --> 00:52:55,060
I'll call you back!

616
00:52:56,510 --> 00:52:59,730
Sir! Sir! No, no, no! Not that!

617
00:52:59,730 --> 00:53:01,490
Bring me something cheaper I can throw!

618
00:53:01,490 --> 00:53:04,350
I said, bring it!

619
00:53:04,350 --> 00:53:08,180
This...

620
00:53:08,180 --> 00:53:10,710
They took away Director Park from the hotel and blocked all the news articles.

621
00:53:10,710 --> 00:53:13,030
Damn bastards!

622
00:53:13,030 --> 00:53:15,930
  Gyeong Ah  

623
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:19,380
Who are you guys?

624
00:53:19,380 --> 00:53:21,710
If we say "By the way" you should answer with, "Okay."

625
00:53:21,710 --> 00:53:25,500
We're suing for defamation and slander.

626
00:53:32,130 --> 00:53:36,090
These TOP bastards, just you wait!

627
00:53:36,090 --> 00:53:37,290
This is a second-hand phone, right?

628
00:53:37,290 --> 00:53:38,810
I can throw it, right?

629
00:53:38,810 --> 00:53:40,800
No! You can't!

630
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:41,940
Not this!

631
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:42,780
That's no good?

632
00:53:42,780 --> 00:53:44,720
Not this either!

633
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:48,000
Okay, that's okay.

634
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:51,510
Hey bring that back! Bring it back quickly!

635
00:53:51,510 --> 00:53:53,090
Bring it!

636
00:53:53,090 --> 00:53:54,830
Bring it!

637
00:53:54,830 --> 00:53:58,550
Hurry and bring it back! I said hurry up!

638
00:54:04,750 --> 00:54:08,630
Newspatch Kim Boo Gi.

639
00:54:10,610 --> 00:54:12,620
Kim Boo Gi?

640
00:54:18,690 --> 00:54:20,410

00:54:20,410 --> 00:54:24,150
 MC Family's Last Child 

642
00:54:24,150 --> 00:54:25,800
 Kim Boo Gi 

643
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:27,020
 Kim Boo Gi 

644
00:54:27,020 --> 00:54:29,920
 Kim Boo Gi 

645
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:34,380
 Kim Boo Gi 

646
00:54:37,620 --> 00:54:40,880
 Director Mo Han Joo, an image of good looks and warmth 

647
00:54:50,830 --> 00:54:52,920
You worked hard.

648
00:54:53,770 --> 00:54:55,120
How is Seok Hui?

649
00:54:55,120 --> 00:55:01,330
Seeing how she's keeping up to date through Lawyer Yoon, I don't think she's totally uninterested in management.

650
00:55:03,210 --> 00:55:05,770
We need to check her intentions.

651
00:55:05,770 --> 00:55:06,790
How?

652
00:55:06,790 --> 00:55:09,740
Use the marriage card.

653
00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:13,840
Wonderful. That's a good idea.

654
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:17,760
Use the opportunity to marry her off. She's of age anyway.

655
00:55:22,810 --> 00:55:25,190
Tell Seok Hui to come in.

656
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:29,770
The young miss is here.

657
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:37,410
If someone saw, they'd think we're having a summit.

658
00:55:39,540 --> 00:55:43,040
Do you want to get married or get on a plane immediately?

659
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:45,400
Didn't we decide I'll be staying in Korea?

660
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:49,090
You have to give one to get one. That's compromise.

661
00:55:49,090 --> 00:55:50,870
Choose.

662
00:55:55,020 --> 00:55:58,100
I'm not interested in managing the company.

663
00:56:05,890 --> 00:56:10,300
I guess all of you don't believe me, but if I get married after a set-up, will you believe it?

664
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:12,050
Of course.

665
00:56:12,050 --> 00:56:15,900
Since we considered his family, looks, and character,

666
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:18,660
there shouldn't be anything lacking.

667
00:56:23,670 --> 00:56:25,220
Good.

668
00:56:25,220 --> 00:56:29,530
I'll get...married!

669
00:56:29,530 --> 00:56:33,580
I mean I feel lonely, probably because I lived aboard alone for a long time.

670
00:56:33,580 --> 00:56:36,200
I don't know anyone in Korea.

671
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:39,760
Instead, if I don't like him after getting married, I can get divorced right?

672
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:41,690
That's not happening.

673
00:56:41,690 --> 00:56:46,780
No, what if I get married and he disrespects me?

674
00:56:46,780 --> 00:56:49,940
Or he could be a serial killer.

675
00:56:49,940 --> 00:56:52,800
No way!

676
00:56:59,370 --> 00:57:02,530
But who is he?

677
00:57:02,530 --> 00:57:05,770
  Prosecutor Joo Tae Hyeong  

678
00:57:06,590 --> 00:57:08,240
Joo Tae Hyeong...

679
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:10,900
 Joo Hyeong Woo 

680
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:12,990
Joo Hyeong Woo?

681
00:57:19,950 --> 00:57:25,460
Can you tell me the first moment when you saw your dead mother?

682
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:34,940
  Prosecutor Joo Hyeong Il  

683
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:49,430
My date is the son of the prosecutor Joo Hyeong Il.

684
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:08,760
I'm prettier than you expected right?

685
00:58:10,910 --> 00:58:15,250
Better than the celebrities and I look richer?

686
00:58:15,250 --> 00:58:19,420
How do you like match making with the chaebol's daughter?

687
00:58:20,390 --> 00:58:22,660
What are you doing right now?

688
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:30,450
Right now when we are here, my assets are getting bigger.

689
00:58:30,450 --> 00:58:33,210
Prosecutor's salary isn't much right?

690
00:58:33,210 --> 00:58:37,890
Chaebol family's background and the beautiful heiress

691
00:58:37,890 --> 00:58:41,920
if you want these, you need to give me something.

692
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:44,050
What can you give me?

693
00:58:46,610 --> 00:58:49,720
Passing the bar while attending Seoul National University,

694
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:52,800
A prosecutor at the Central District Prosecutor's Office, father is the Chief of the Central District Prosecutors' Office.

695
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:58,900
I'm the elite prosecutor who has been offered many matche-making dates from the chabeol's family.

696
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:04,180
In the end, though, all prosecutors' qualifications don't vary by much, no?

697
00:59:04,180 --> 00:59:06,580
There are thousands of prosecutors.

698
00:59:06,580 --> 00:59:12,160
I'm saying you need to tell me why I should marry you.

699
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:14,420
You?

700
00:59:14,420 --> 00:59:17,510
You must have nothing to give it to me.

701
00:59:17,510 --> 00:59:21,400
There's no reason to do a business that I can't get benefits from.

702
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:23,210
Why are you here?

703
00:59:23,210 --> 00:59:27,260
Doesn't it hurt a prosecutor's pride to live off of a chaebol?

704
00:59:27,260 --> 00:59:30,320
People say sons take after their fathers...

705
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:32,950
I'm talking about you. You!

706
00:59:32,950 --> 00:59:37,940
♫  You're a liar. You're a liar.  ♫

707
00:59:47,210 --> 00:59:50,920
I guess she doesn't know what prosecutors do exactly.

708
01:00:10,100 --> 01:00:13,570
How can you drink after causing a major issue?

709
01:00:13,570 --> 01:00:17,850
You should have kept on digging into celebrities for Newspatch as usual. Why did you touch MC?

710
01:00:17,850 --> 01:00:20,510
Now you've been sued for defamation. What will you do now?

711
01:00:20,510 --> 01:00:24,550
Being sued for defamation is like a medal to a reporter. I would have given up already if I was afraid of that.

712
01:00:24,550 --> 01:00:27,530
Never acknowledging your wrongdoing even if you're about to die. That's pride.

713
01:00:27,530 --> 01:00:29,830
So that's why I'm saying this.

714
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:33,020
Never mind.

715
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:36,150
What is it? Why are you taking so long to tell me?

716
01:00:36,150 --> 01:00:40,030
Gwang Mi, let's go undercover.

717
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:42,500
That's my specialty...

718
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:46,130
I have a source at the airport, and I was told that MC Group's eldest, Mo Seok Hui, arrived in Korea.

719
01:00:46,130 --> 01:00:47,900
She's the smoking gun of MC Group.

720
01:00:47,900 --> 01:00:49,880
We have nothing to lose, so let's go for it.

721
01:00:49,900 --> 01:00:53,390
Again with MC Group? I don't want to.

722
01:00:53,390 --> 01:00:55,710
This is not working on MC Group but your major.

723
01:00:55,710 --> 01:00:59,280
There's been no entertainment reporter who got a shot of Mo Seok Hui's face who's supposed to be prettier than a celebrity.

724
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:03,430
If you do, it'll be an exclusive and makes you the first reporter to achieve it.

725
01:01:03,430 --> 01:01:07,440
A person who seeks attention with the most clicks, this would be a dereliction of duty.

726
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:11,230
So there's no reporter who's gotten a shot of Mo Seok Hui's face is what you're saying, right?

727
01:01:11,230 --> 01:01:13,680
That's what I'm saying. And she's supposed to be pretty.

728
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:17,300
And you can't leave alone any woman who is prettier than you.

729
01:01:22,750 --> 01:01:26,850
I am proud of that disposition of yours.

730
01:01:26,850 --> 01:01:28,670
Gwang Mi...

731
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:40,450
Let's go.

732
01:01:45,050 --> 01:01:47,630
 Director  Han Je Gook 

733
01:01:50,100 --> 01:01:54,190
Director, I'm sorry for bothering you on your break.

734
01:01:54,190 --> 01:01:56,440
- It's Code Red. 
 - What's happened?

735
01:01:56,500 --> 01:01:59,460
We've received info that Prosecutor Joo Tae Hyeon is doing an internal investigation of our group.

736
01:01:59,460 --> 01:02:03,220
They've turned all their phones off and confined themselves inside the prosecutor's office. I think they're determined.

737
01:02:03,220 --> 01:02:07,750
- Is the Chief Prosecutor aware of this? 
 - He's turned his phone off as well.

738
01:02:07,750 --> 01:02:08,770
What's the reason?

739
01:02:08,770 --> 01:02:12,610
I think Miss Mo offended Prosecutor Joo at the match-made date.

740
01:02:12,610 --> 01:02:16,060
I think the Chief Prosecutor, too, will have a hard time stopping him even though it's his son.

741
01:02:16,060 --> 01:02:20,010
The prosecutor is the type who can't hold back when his pride gets hurt.

742
01:02:21,390 --> 01:02:27,250
Mo Seok Hui... is she slowly starting to show her claws?

743
01:02:27,250 --> 01:02:32,120
If his pride was hurt, we have to build it back up...

744
01:02:34,950 --> 01:02:39,970
Mo Seok Hui... should be sent far away.

745
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:36,450
You're right on time. Let's go.

746
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:33,210
 Rest in Peace An Jae Rim
 1958/11/05 - 2004/06/23 

747
01:04:58,190 --> 01:05:00,780
Who is it if I may ask?

748
01:05:01,660 --> 01:05:03,520
It's my mom.

749
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:06,760
Your mother died? How?

750
01:05:11,470 --> 01:05:14,080
It was a heart attack.

751
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:21,760
Don't write fiction in your head and just do your job well.

752
01:05:47,860 --> 01:05:50,200
It's an urgent matter. Can I take a look in your briefcase?

753
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:52,530
Wait a minute. This is illegal.

754
01:05:52,530 --> 01:05:55,570
What are you doing without a search warrant?

755
01:05:57,950 --> 01:05:59,040
What are you doing?

756
01:05:59,040 --> 01:06:00,620
What's going on?

757
01:06:00,620 --> 01:06:02,410
What are you doing?

758
01:06:07,580 --> 01:06:11,670
We're arresting you for breaking the law by being in possession of drugs.

759
01:06:11,670 --> 01:06:15,530
You have the right to remain silent and you have the right not to say anything that might be incriminating

760
01:06:15,530 --> 01:06:18,180
You have the right to an attorney.

761
01:06:18,180 --> 01:06:20,050
Arrest her.

762
01:06:30,900 --> 01:06:33,630
Hey! It wasn't me.

763
01:06:34,450 --> 01:06:36,790
It wasn't me!

764
01:06:39,960 --> 01:06:46,950


765
01:06:48,050 --> 01:06:53,200
 ♬ The night everything fell apart ♬ 

766
01:06:54,100 --> 01:06:57,300
 ♬ I never go there ♬

 ♬ Fly away, the terrible... ♬ 

770
01:07:13,120 --> 01:07:16,380
 Graceful Family 

771
01:07:16,380 --> 01:07:17,560
Who is that idiot?

772
01:07:17,560 --> 01:07:19,580
Sorry. I screamed 'cause I was a bit annoyed.

773
01:07:19,580 --> 01:07:22,820
I think they've decided to investigate you while you are in custody.

774
01:07:22,820 --> 01:07:23,790
Why are you here?

775
01:07:23,790 --> 01:07:25,910
Do you admit to the drug charges?

776
01:07:25,910 --> 01:07:28,220
Don't get involved. This is TOP's order.

777
01:07:28,220 --> 01:07:30,530
As an attorney, I need to know the truth.

778
01:07:30,530 --> 01:07:33,320
Look here, Lawyer Hwa Yeon Do.

779
01:07:33,320 --> 01:07:35,650
To me, you're also a suspect.

780
01:07:35,650 --> 01:07:37,150
Prove that I am innocent.

781
01:07:37,150 --> 01:07:40,030
I think she needs to stay in jail a while longer.

782
01:07:40,030 --> 01:07:44,050
 ♬ ...to that place ♬
