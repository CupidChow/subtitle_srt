00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:35,200
 For intentional violation of the government's standards for discharge of waste water  

7
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,400
 Episode 5 
  by discarding 70 thousand tons of waste 

8
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:42,670
 I sentence Yoon Jae Goo of MC Chemicals to seven years in prison,  

9
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:45,100
 which is more than the amount the prosecutor requested. 

10
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:59,600


11
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:03,900
 Judge Han Je Gook who sentenced a high-ranking   member of a large corporation to prison 

12
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:08,800
 was recognized within the court system as a righteous judge who couldn't be influenced.  

13
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,600
 Sunbae, why did you overturn my decision on MC Group Chemicals Executive Yoon Jae Goo? 

14
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,400
 How could he be not guilty? 

15
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,500
 I followed the law faithfully. 

16
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,100
 The law? 

17
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:24,300
 Sunbaenim, aren't you ashamed? 

18
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:28,300
 By chance, were you lobbied by MC Group? 

19
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:32,600
  Hey! Judge Han Je Gook, there are lines you should never cross! 

20
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,000
 Aren't you the one who crossed that line? 

21
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,200
 You should be ashamed! 

22
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:45,000
 Too bad. I  was looking forward to the first female Chief Justice. 

23
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,500
 It's a shame... 

24
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,700
 Hello. 

25
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,100
 She was transferred to Yeongdeok. 

26
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,600
 Judge Han Je Gook transferred from Seoul Central District Court to Deaegu District Court, Yeongdeok branch. 

27
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,900
 The woman who had held fast to breaking the glass ceiling 

28
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,300
 and was hit with a personnel transfer to the countryside 

29
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:27,900
 was so angry with the judicial organization that she became disillusioned. 

30
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,900
 It's Mo Wan Pyo. 

31
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:47,100
 Ambitious judges like you are hard to come by. 

32
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,600
 And you are a woman on top of that. 

33
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:52,400
 You have lots of misconceptions and prejudice against women. 

34
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:57,600
 It's because I'm an out of touch, old fashioned man. 

35
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,500
 What is the reason why you called to see me? 

36
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,200
 Your MC executive was acquitted. 

37
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,200
 Come to MC Group. 

38
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:13,100
 They say that when a person changes it's time for them to die but I'm still going strong. 

39
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:19,400
  Come to MC where you won't be discriminated against as a woman and do some great things. 

40
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,400
 I'll support you. 

41
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:03,600
 The chairman wanted to make his granddaughter Seok Hui the leader of MC Group 

42
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:07,300
 so he was expecting Judge Han Je Gook to be a big help. 

43
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,900
 However, since the result turned out to be the complete opposite, 

44
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,300
 that's life's irony. 

45
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,700
 Graceful Family 

46
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,800
The Head Chairman is entering.

47
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:44,100
Today, since MC Distribution board of directors have joined us here,

48
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:50,000
Chairman Mo has something to say personally.

49
00:04:53,700 --> 00:05:00,700
I, Mo Wan Pyo, give MC Distributions in its entirety and  all real estate,

50
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:04,800
as an advance gift to my granddaughter, Mo Seok Hui.

51
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:12,800
If my granddaughter Mo Seok Hui is in an accident or passes away,

52
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:19,200
everything that was given will be donated to society.

53
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:38,100
- So, you're telling me that you knew about this. 
 - Yes.

54
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,000
But why didn't you say anything?

55
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,500
I had to make sure.

56
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,000
About the burner phone you wanted me to look into before.

57
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,600
Since it's from the Seonggok-dong cell area, I was looking into the household members and it's Housekeeper Jung's second phone.

58
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,900
Housekeeper Jung?

59
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:56,000
Yes, it's been 5 years.

60
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,500
She's been double-crossing me.

61
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:06,500
Seeing how she called in Miss as soon as Head Chairman collapses, something seems fishy, no?

62
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:10,400
I will search through all hospitals and check up on Head Chairman's condition.

63
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,500
I had to find out the contents of Head Chairman's will exactly.

64
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:17,500
If we had dealt with Seok Hui too hastily, MC Group right now

65
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:21,200
would have been run by a charitable group.

66
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:25,700
Then what's TOP's alternative?

67
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:28,500
- There isn't one. 
 - Director Han!

68
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:32,000
Seok Hui has become MC Distribution's top shareholder through legitimate means.

69
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,400
So, what are you going to do if Seok Hui says she wants to run it herself?

70
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:41,500
Since Seok Hui is the top shareholder, the executives will elect her as CEO as is customary.

71
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:45,200
At the moment, if Seok Hui wants to run the company, we have no way to block her.

72
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,200
Are you playing with words with me right now?

73
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,300
You're being noisy.

74
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:54,700
Since Seok Hui is not CEO yet, we should keep calm and wait.

75
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,900
Honey, aren't you believing her way too easily?

76
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:15,100
Leave it to her. She hates losing even more than I do.

77
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:30,000
You must have worked hard while leading a double life at your age.

78
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,200
I will be leaving now.

79
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,400
You've grown so much I barely recognize you.

80
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:55,200
You're really my Seok Hui, right?

81
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:59,400
Yes, Grandpa. I'm Seok Hui.

82
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,500
Now I can die with no regrets.

83
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:11,900
The hard times are now over. Your time has come.

84
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:16,200
You have to be beside me for a very long time, Grandpa.

85
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:19,500
Yes, yes. I should.

86
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,000
Housekeeper Jeong is coming in.

87
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,700
I really had no clue.

88
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:40,000
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you sooner. I couldn't do if for safety's sake.

89
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,500
You should have given a hint at least to me.

90
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:48,100
I'm sorry. It was the prudent thing to do.

91
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:52,000
Then are you the one who has been sending me messages?

92
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,100
Yes. I had another phone that TOP didn't know about.

93
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:00,400
I didn't even know that and I misunderstood you as someone on my stepmother's side.

94
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:06,700
I'm very sorry and also, I'm thankful that you protected my grandpa.

95
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:09,300
Before your mother was murdered...

96
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:19,180
Before that thing happened to her,

97
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:23,900
your grandfather was already unconscious in the hospital.

98
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:29,500
That's why when you were sent to the United States by force, he couldn't do anything about it.

99
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:35,700
Your grandpa always thought of you.

100
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:40,700
He couldn't even contact you because of TOP, and has always prepared for this day only.

101
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,600
Now I,

102
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:47,300
will return everything to its rightful place.

103
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,300
Then, please get some rest.

104
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,300
Are you alright?

105
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:13,800
Yeah, I'm just a bit tired, but I'm okay.

106
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,500
It looks like you have something to say.

107
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:26,200
The saying that you'd put everything back in its place, what did you mean?

108
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:31,500
For example, finding the real culprit rather than the fake one.

109
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,500
Well. I have so many things I have to fix.

110
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:40,000
Tell me what you really want to do, so I can help you.

111
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,600
-Why should I?
-You said you needed me.

112
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:47,700
I work for the company. I can't use it for personal reasons.

113
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:54,900
Do you even know how I lived the past 15 years?

114
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:58,400
I'm going to go my own way without your concern,

115
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:01,200
so whether or not you help, do whatever.

116
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,400
It's because I'm worried.

117
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,600
Go.

118
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:12,400
Since we're going be busy starting now, take tomorrow off.

119
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:17,200
Congrats on your grandpa waking up.

120
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:39,700
Of course, reasonable people like you wouldn't understand.

121
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,000
   Im Soon  

122
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:00,300
She's the maid who is in prison.

123
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,500
Im Soon.

124
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:07,400
Im Soon must be the name of that maid from back then.

125
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,980
I visited her in prison around the time of the incident but because Director Han has been watching me

126
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:14,060
I don't know where she is now.

127
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:16,630
You must step in now, Miss.

128
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,180
Ooh, our Eun Ji,

129
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:28,080
you're so enthusiastic. I feel so supported.

130
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:32,100
As my friend's father you are pretty much my father so this is the least I can do.

131
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:36,300
Anyway, you worked hard. It's late, so you should go now.

132
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:39,180
It's not that late.

133
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,640
Is Yoon Do waiting?

134
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:49,660
No.  Oh, my throat's dry.

135
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:53,130
I'm home.

136
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:55,280
Oh! My son, you came?

137
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:58,260
You came? I was about to leave. Should I give you something  cool to drink?

138
00:12:58,260 --> 00:12:59,510
Should I give you something refreshing to drink?

139
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:01,130
It's late, so you should just go.

140
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:04,970
It's fine! Sit.

141
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,580
That's not right.

142
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:16,610
If it were you, instead of leaving it to your son who's been running the company for decades

143
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:19,960
would you entrust the company to a granddaughter who doesn't know as much as I do?

144
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:23,650
No, I'd never entrust to a granddaughter like you.

145
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:27,490
Father, he's dissing me right now, right?

146
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:29,400
What's a diss?

147
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:33,730
Anyway, she's right. It's ridiculous.

148
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:34,890
Right?

149
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:39,020
Of course. That household is strange.

150
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:41,970
There's some kind of story.

151
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:46,130
Do you think, by any chance, that the Chairman isn't his biological son?

152
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:50,530
That must be it, a birth secret.

153
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,840
Hold on.

154
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:57,390
What do you want?

155
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:59,070
Find a person for me.

156
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:00,410
Who is it?

157
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:02,980
- Im Soon.
- Who?

158
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:05,320
She's probably been in prison for 15 years.

159
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:08,050
I'll send you her name and citizen id number

160
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:09,420
so find out which prison she's in.

161
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:10,670
Who is it, this person?

162
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:14,260
There's nothing to know, just find her.

163
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,430
Is there, by chance, anything wrong?

164
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:22,300
Huh? No, nothing.

165
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:41,790
Our victory starts now so what's with everyone's expressions.

166
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:44,290
The situation is a bit complicated.

167
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:49,280
Since the gift was legal, there's no way to overturn it with the law.

168
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:53,150
The other side has already finished negotiating with the National Tax Service for their gift tax.

169
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:55,830
And it's a win in the eyes of the government since they are going to pay the proper taxes.

170
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:59,240
This is the worst possible scenario we predicted.

171
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,320
So, we should find a solution.

172
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:07,120
Isn't getting the shareholders to reject Seok Hui the best strategy for now?

173
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,590
Yes. Mo Seok Hui might be the top shareholder

174
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:14,870
but can't we ensure that she doesn't become CEO?

175
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:16,920
What is the precise breakdown of shares?

176
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,150
Projector.

177
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:25,550
31.6% is Miss', and we have 31.4% so we're on equal footing.

178
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:27,590
Foreign investors, our private shares,

179
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:31,170
and if we combine all the small investors, we can overturn it.

180
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:32,820
Okay.

181
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:35,720
Team Leader Yoon make contact with CEOs with voting rights

182
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,800
and obtain reports that's advantageous to us.

183
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,290
And with that, convince foreign investors.

184
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:43,350
Team leaders Gwon and Lee, find private investors

185
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:45,840
and make them vote against Miss.

186
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:50,530
And you, find out the reasons why she's not qualified to be MC Group's Chairwoman.

187
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:53,250
- The more, the better. 
 - Yes.

188
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:56,390
By the way, Lawyer Heo has paid leave starting tomorrow.

189
00:15:56,390 --> 00:16:00,030
Don't mind there, let's just focus on our mission.

190
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:01,280
Alright.

191
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,980
  Im Soon 
 641007-213007 

192
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:09,390
 Seoul Central Disctrict Court Case No. 2004-Godan 9505 

193
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:15,450
 Charge: Murder
 Name:  Im Soon; Resident ID  641007-213007 

194
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,820
-  Can I ask who this person is?
- She's my mom. 

195
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:22,550
 Did she pass away? How? 

196
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:24,070
 Her heart stopped. 

197
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:28,110
 When your mother was killed- before that thing happened, 

198
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:32,930
 Defendant Im Soon, for taking away a precious live by cruel means,  

199
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:34,820
 I sentence you to life without parole. 

200
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:37,570
 ... finding the real criminal instead of a fake one. 

201
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:38,690
 -Tae Ho! 
 - Mom! 

202
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:40,360
 - It wasn't Mom!
- Mom! Mom! 

203
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,780
 It wasn't me! 

204
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:45,300
 Im Soon, she's probably been locked up for 15 years. 

205
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,590
 Find out which prison. 

206
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,910
What's up with this car?

207
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:50,120
Let's switch cars only for today.

208
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,230
Why should I switch cars? Where are you going?

209
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:52,710
I'll explain later, okay?

210
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:54,650
Hey, I don't have insurance for other drivers.

211
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:58,240
I have really good insurance that allows for other drivers, that works for you right?

212
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,900
Hey hey hey! Am I a pushover?

213
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:07,010
Why do you keep asking for things whenever you want! To  National Police Force detectives, you think you can... Hey!

214
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:42,250
You're leaving for work early.

215
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:44,820
I'm busy.

216
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:49,560
Why are you always so busy?

217
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:58,870
Of course, since you're about to lose the whole company to your younger sister,

218
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:01,980
you must be really busy working hard.

219
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:03,370
Here.

220
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,490
Don't try to pick a fight.

221
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:07,700
Fight?

222
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:10,390
If you were going to live however you wanted, why did you marry?

223
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:12,440
Are we a couple?

224
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:20,430
Do you love me?

225
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:25,180
Why are acting like you really love me?

226
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:29,850
You told me you'd divorce me when you are made the successor.

227
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:31,720
When on earth is that?

228
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:34,180
Didn't Young Lady get chosen as successor?

229
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:36,800
Are you going to imprison me in this household forever?

230
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,400
Don't worry. I'll divorce you when the time comes.

231
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:43,750
That's what I'm asking you! When will that be! Every day is hell for me!

232
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:51,000
Shut your mouth

233
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,740
before I cut off your family's credit cards.

234
00:19:55,480 --> 00:20:00,660
Fine, cut them off!

235
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:05,730
In return, I'll cut your windpipe myself.

236
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:22,260
 Visitor 

237
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:32,840
 Heo Yoon Do, Lawyer. 

238
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:03,620
 Don't visit Mom again. 

239
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:09,200
 Don't look back and live your life. 

240
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,790
 Listen well to Uncle and forget Mom. 

241
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:20,700
 And... don't ever visit, okay? 

242
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:23,590
 Promise me. 

243
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:30,300
 Live well, okay? Hmm? 

244
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:33,170
 Your time is over, let's go. 

245
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:42,430
 Mom, Mom, Mom! 

246
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:47,150
 Mom... 

247
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:05,830
 Please make sure to tell her that it's her son Park Tae Ho. 

248
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:17,280
 She's refusing your visit. 

249
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:24,120
 She's refusing your visit. 

250
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,980
 She's refusing your visit. 

251
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:44,810
 Room 2 

252
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:43,930
I was told an MC Group lawyer came to see me.

253
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:48,400
Lawyer Heo Yoon Do?

254
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,900
Mom.

255
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:11,130
Tae...Tae Ho.

256
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,200
Is it  you?

257
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:27,830
I'm right...

258
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:30,260
I'm right, it's Tae Ho.

259
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:33,440
It's my son, Tae Ho.

260
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:54,590
I'm your mom and I couldn't even recognize my son.

261
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,260
I'm sorry.

262
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:00,820
I'm sorry.

263
00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:04,880
Mom, what are you sorry for?

264
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:07,830
I'm the one who's sorry.

265
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:14,780
I became a lawyer,

266
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:18,960
but I couldn't even visit.

267
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:23,560
You became a lawyer?

268
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,270
Yeah.

269
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,570
I...

270
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:38,740
Your son... became a lawyer.

271
00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:42,660
I'm proud, my son.

272
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:49,340
All this time... why did you reject my visitation?

273
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:53,150
Did you not know how much I missed you?

274
00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:03,340
I'm... very sorry.

275
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,890
Your visit has ended.

276
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:31,170
Mom. Mom, you know lawyer Han Je Gook, right?

277
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:37,760
The person who got murdered... she's MC Group's chairman's wife, right?

278
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:41,510
No... no, I don't know.

279
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:44,750
I'll leave a request for an attorney, so make sure you sign it.

280
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:48,780
I'm going to ask for a retrial and clear you of the false charges.

281
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:51,290
No. No, Tae Ho.

282
00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:53,950
Don't do that.

283
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:58,610
Tae Ho, you really can't do that.

284
00:26:58,610 --> 00:27:00,920
Mom is the criminal.

285
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,770
Don't do anything.

286
00:27:02,770 --> 00:27:06,100
3059, your visitation is finished.

287
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:56,110
 There won't be an appeal. 

288
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:58,490
 What does that mean? 

289
00:27:58,490 --> 00:28:02,370
 There won't be any more trials over this case. 

290
00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:06,270
 Lawyer... what does that mean? 

291
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:08,510
 Then, when do I leave? 

292
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:11,110
 For now, you won't be able to. 

293
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:12,390
 For how long?... 

294
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:15,720
 If you committed murder, you have to receive appropriate punishment. 

295
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,180
 It will take awhile. 

296
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:19,690
 Why are you being like this, Lawyer? 

297
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:24,080
 You told me you'd release me immediately once I admit the murder! 

298
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:28,260
 You know that I didn't kill her! You said you'd help me! 

299
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:31,780
 Your son's name is Park Tae Ho, right? 

300
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:35,070
 He's tall. And he's a little plump, too.  

301
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:36,820
 What about my son? 

302
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:39,960
 The son who's out there all alone needs to grow up well, no? 

303
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:43,260
 Please, please... 

304
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:45,510
 Please don't touch my Tae Ho. 

305
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:47,350
 I'll beg like this! 

306
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:48,650
 Don't worry. 

307
00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:52,750
 Until you get out, we'll take good care of him. 

308
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:58,680
 In return, don't even utter the words "innocent". 

309
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,550
 Understood? 

310
00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:05,820
 Even if your son visits you, you should never meet him. 

311
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:11,170
 The minute you meet him, you can never meet him again. 

312
00:29:11,170 --> 00:29:13,760
 Okay, I'll do that. 

313
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:17,980
 Please save my Tae Ho. 

314
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:50,660
 Tae Ho, you really can't do that. 

315
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:55,430
 It's correct that Mom is the criminal. Don't do anything! 

316
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,880
 Mo Seok Hui 

317
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:38,980
What's he doing?

318
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:41,360
What the, is he pissed?

319
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:50,700
Did you find out what prison she's in?

320
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:56,830
Arrange an interview with News Patch and call me back when you get this message.

321
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:01,830
If Mo Seok Hui is elected as the new CEO,

322
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:06,200
all the business prospects that the current CEO is pursuing will come to a stop.

323
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:09,270
If that happens, we will have to start all over with our current investments

324
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:12,380
and new businesses will have a great chance at failing due to lack of experience in management.

325
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:16,100
The probability that stock prices will fall is very high, are you okay with that?

326
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:19,760
But according to the company principles, the CEO should be the largest shareholder

327
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:23,550
who is Mo Seok Hui and would be best suited.

328
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:26,360
For a long time, we have always worked for Head Chairman,

329
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:32,340
so I think we're in agreement that the CEO should be Seok Hui.

330
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:45,650
What is this?

331
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:56,920
It seems your wife hired a  private detective.

332
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:59,810
We got a hold of them before her and are giving them to you.

333
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:06,790
TOP will take care of this matter so that it won't create a problem.

334
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:11,440
If you're uncomfortable showing up at the shareholder's meeting, you can provide a power of attorney.

335
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,560
I understand.

336
00:32:22,810 --> 00:32:24,110
Is everything ready?

337
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:26,260
Yes.

338
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:29,760
Let's go.

339
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,180
Who is it?

340
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:40,380
Hello, I came from MC Group.

341
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:46,320
Hello. I came to say hello since you have agreed to attend the MC Group shareholder's meeting.

342
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:49,670
Yes, thank you.

343
00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:50,970
Thank you.

344
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:52,560
Good afternoon, everybody.

345
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:57,130
Thank you for attending this conference on such a short notice.

346
00:32:57,130 --> 00:33:03,630
The point here is that her management ability was not verified at all.

347
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:07,440
She has never dealt with any of the business regarding MC Group.

348
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:12,100
Also, she's known for her freewheeling personality

349
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:16,550
who has a high risk of impulsive decision-making.

350
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:19,430
We've talked to the 3 CEOs with voting rights.

351
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:21,460
Reports should be written in a way that benefits us.

352
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:24,190
I've finished the briefing with the investors too.

353
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:26,450
I'm almost done visiting the investors as well.

354
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:29,120
Keep working hard.

355
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,330
 TOP 

356
00:33:31,330 --> 00:33:33,530
Everyone is in favor for us.

357
00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:37,760
Miss is an unfamiliar person and she has no proven record when it comes to management.

358
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,060
That's a relief.

359
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:41,470
I've got to go. I have a meeting with the union boss.

360
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:43,190
Got it.

361
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:48,990
- And you? 
 - She has no arrest records, drug-related or DUIs. Everything is clean.

362
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:52,720
The only thing you could really pick on is spending too much money? Clubbing and luxury goods.

363
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,830
How about her psychiatric records?

364
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:57,260
There is none.

365
00:33:57,260 --> 00:34:00,510
But her nutritionist's reports are interesting.

366
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:02,250
Is that so?

367
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:12,780
Physical Examination, vital statistics. 
Name: Mo Seok Hui; Age:29 years old; Height: 65 inches.

368
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:14,490
Weight: 110 pounds; BMI: 25; RHR (beats): 60; RBP (beats): 105/63; Pulse Oximetry: 97%

369
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:25,140
 Young Lady Mo Seok Hui 

370
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:32,630
 It's Mo Seok Hui. 

371
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:48,520
Sit down.

372
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:56,660
Was there a time when the two of us had a meal?

373
00:34:56,660 --> 00:35:01,060
I wonder... not in my memory.

374
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:06,120
What can I treat you to, so that you'll be nice to me?

375
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:08,520
I'm nervous.

376
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:11,820
Are you vegetarian? I'm not.

377
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:14,450
I'm fine with meat, too.

378
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:35,630
How did my grandfather scout you, who's so straightforward?

379
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:38,690
Head Chairman was an honest person.

380
00:35:38,690 --> 00:35:42,970
Then why did you abandon him and switch over to my father's team?

381
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:47,830
Of course, I'm sure there was a reason to everything.

382
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:53,750
You're not after money,

383
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:57,760
and you are not after a fancy honor that gets the spotlight.

384
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:04,220
I thought about why you diligently do everything in the dark and stay in TOP.

385
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:07,320
I did some thinking.

386
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:12,700
And? Did you get an answer?

387
00:36:13,810 --> 00:36:16,820
Pride as king maker.

388
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,530
That's interesting.

389
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:27,720
The pleasure of being the real power behind the curtains?

390
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:34,140
You remind me of J. Edgar Hoover, the director of the US FBI.

391
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:40,250
He was the FBI Director until his death and used all sorts of intelligence to control even the President.

392
00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:41,260
Did you know about Hoover?

393
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:45,940
I know much more than you would've thought, right?

394
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:47,770
Hoover...

395
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:50,920
I'll take that as a compliment.

396
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:56,020
Director Han, why don't you bet on me now?

397
00:36:56,020 --> 00:37:00,170
You need to become CEO at the shareholders meeting first.

398
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:02,790
Let's talk again after that.

399
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:06,090
Okay.

400
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:10,400
I didn't think that I'd get you that easily anyway.

401
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:14,970
You ate a lot.

402
00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:19,590
That person is trying to earn $5000

403
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:22,120
Even if she's suffering with feet on ice,

404
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:25,490
she performs.
Do you know why I often...

405
00:38:25,490 --> 00:38:28,660
listen to music like this?

406
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:35,450
My situation is the same as that musician's.

407
00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:37,590
To not forget that.

408
00:38:37,590 --> 00:38:39,630
Mother.

409
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:46,170
My son whom I'm proud of.

410
00:38:46,170 --> 00:38:51,830
Listen. You've been a genius since you were a child.

411
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:56,770
If you did not exist, people would've pointed fingers at me.

412
00:38:56,770 --> 00:39:01,150
They all whisper behind my back that I stole someone else's family

413
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:04,440
but they don't have the courage to say it to my face.

414
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:10,100
But I gave birth to the genius successor of MC Group.

415
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:16,090
Mother, did you ever think about the possibility that I may want to do other things?

416
00:39:16,090 --> 00:39:19,500
No! I never did!

417
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:21,790
There can never  be an MC Group without you.

418
00:39:21,790 --> 00:39:26,580
I believed in you all this time, just like that performer...

419
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:29,610
lived on top of ice.

420
00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:41,230
But what are we going to do Wan Joon?

421
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:47,890
Because of Seok Hui, my dream... no.

422
00:39:47,890 --> 00:39:53,330
our dream has turned to sea foam.

423
00:39:53,330 --> 00:39:57,010
You're drunk. Stop drinking and get up.

424
00:40:02,810 --> 00:40:05,340
Cold bastard.

425
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:24,740
What on earth are you doing on top of ice?

426
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:26,570
Get down.

427
00:40:26,570 --> 00:40:28,870
Why are you being disrespectful in the middle of the performance?

428
00:40:28,870 --> 00:40:29,690
Get out.

429
00:40:29,690 --> 00:40:32,390
Get down right now!!

430
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:42,000
Are your feet okay?

431
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,330
Yes, I'm okay.

432
00:40:45,330 --> 00:40:49,320
Stopping in the middle of the performance is a breach of contract.

433
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:52,610
You're not going to get any pay today so leave.

434
00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:03,050
That person lost a $5000 performance fee today.

435
00:41:03,050 --> 00:41:07,260
Because of you. Would someone like you know what art is?

436
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:11,800
Art? This isn't art; it's torture.

437
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:14,910
How can a person do such a horrible thing?

438
00:41:14,910 --> 00:41:17,550
Oh that's right. Are you not a person?

439
00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:18,900
Shut your mouth.

440
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:22,990
Why don't you yourself perform on top of ice?

441
00:41:22,990 --> 00:41:25,790
How much money do I have to give you to go up there?

442
00:41:25,790 --> 00:41:29,630
$5000? $10,000?!

443
00:41:41,350 --> 00:41:43,240
How dare you do this to me!

444
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:44,630
How can someone like you dare do this to me!

445
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:48,380
Stop overreacting.

446
00:41:49,210 --> 00:41:52,030
You awful girl!

447
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:58,360
I can't live.

448
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:03,150
Get up!

449
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:08,760
Let go... You're not gonna let go?

450
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:20,580
Where do you think... how dare you use violence in my house.

451
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:23,690
This is an immoral act. Apologize right away.

452
00:42:23,690 --> 00:42:26,920
Why is it immoral when she and I have no blood relationship?

453
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:29,170
The person who always refused to acknowledge her as your mom is you.

454
00:42:29,170 --> 00:42:33,520
Because of who did I lose Mom? How can I acknowledge that woman?

455
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:36,650
- I said to say sorry!
- I can't!

456
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:44,620
You... should never have been born.

457
00:42:46,290 --> 00:42:51,470
Is that what a father should say to his daughter?

458
00:42:51,470 --> 00:42:55,010
I never raised a daughter like you.

459
00:42:55,010 --> 00:42:58,330
You're right. Our father-daughter relationship ended 15 years ago

460
00:42:58,330 --> 00:43:01,370
when you abandoned me in the United States.

461
00:43:02,230 --> 00:43:04,170
Get out!

462
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:08,970
You should live more like a human from now on.

463
00:43:08,970 --> 00:43:12,580
Kick her out right this instant!

464
00:43:13,830 --> 00:43:16,460
I'm going to leave on my own accord!

465
00:43:20,670 --> 00:43:23,860
Did I come into this house to receive this kind of treatment from that girl?

466
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:28,110
How will she run a business when she has no manners at all?

467
00:43:28,110 --> 00:43:31,010
How long are you going to leave that little witch alone!

468
00:43:31,010 --> 00:43:31,850
Stop it.

469
00:43:31,850 --> 00:43:33,970
- Stop it! 
 - She's the one who got worked up, not me.

470
00:43:33,970 --> 00:43:39,410
I can't stand it any longer so I'm telling you to get Mo Seok Hui out of my sight right now!

471
00:43:39,410 --> 00:43:41,990
I told you to stop it!

472
00:44:06,210 --> 00:44:10,220
 You need to become CEO at the shareholders meeting first. 

473
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:13,350
 I never raised a daughter like you. 

474
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:31,750
Go easy.

475
00:44:31,750 --> 00:44:34,580
Why are acting like you were dumped?

476
00:44:37,630 --> 00:44:40,120
If you were going to drink by yourself, why did you call me out?

477
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:42,980
You need to say something so that I can understand.

478
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:54,820
Did you perhaps... meet your mom?

479
00:44:55,690 --> 00:44:57,350
Yeah.

480
00:44:59,050 --> 00:45:01,070
I see.

481
00:45:04,310 --> 00:45:10,420
In 15 years, I met my mom, but...

482
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:17,780
She's become an old lady who doesn't even recognize her son.

483
00:45:20,010 --> 00:45:22,210
That warrants a drink...

484
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:25,370
But,

485
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:29,770
what's more ridiculous is...

486
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:47,990
Damn. Those MC bastards covered it up.

487
00:45:47,990 --> 00:45:52,860
That's why you couldn't get the police report.

488
00:45:52,860 --> 00:45:59,200
Then, that ill-tempered girl is the victim's daughter?

489
00:46:02,730 --> 00:46:04,830
That girl's temper was no joke.

490
00:46:04,830 --> 00:46:07,660
Aren't you gonna get fired first thing from the company?

491
00:46:07,660 --> 00:46:12,280
No no no. Your mother's case is a tragedy

492
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:18,010
but there's also a duty to find the real perpetrator for that woman who is also a victim.

493
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:30,870
Father.

494
00:46:32,450 --> 00:46:34,720
Did something happen?

495
00:46:36,470 --> 00:46:38,790
What could happen?

496
00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:43,350
Nothing's wrong.

497
00:46:43,350 --> 00:46:46,060
There must be something wrong.

498
00:46:49,390 --> 00:46:51,300
Father.

499
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:58,500
Long ago, when you met me at Han River, why didn't you ask?

500
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:00,610
What would I have asked you?

501
00:47:00,610 --> 00:47:04,340
What my parents did...

502
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:08,000
How I ended up being by myself, you didn't ask me that.

503
00:47:09,250 --> 00:47:12,240
When time comes you''ll say something,

504
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:16,020
and when you don't say anything ...  there must be a reason.

505
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:20,770
I think today's that day.

506
00:47:26,190 --> 00:47:31,620
My mom is in prison.

507
00:47:32,540 --> 00:47:34,850
For 15 years.

508
00:47:35,780 --> 00:47:38,430
If it were not for you,

509
00:47:40,050 --> 00:47:42,600
I really would've died.

510
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:49,410
Father, thank you.

511
00:47:49,410 --> 00:47:53,840
Thankful for what... I'm the one who's more thankful.

512
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:59,350
You met a bad father and became a lawyer despite going through all that hardship.

513
00:47:59,350 --> 00:48:04,030
My son, in 15 years,

514
00:48:04,730 --> 00:48:07,300
you finally met your mom.

515
00:48:57,370 --> 00:49:00,740
What's this? You even turned off your phone.

516
00:49:00,740 --> 00:49:02,560
Did you arrange an interview with News Patch?

517
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:04,280
I did.

518
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:06,180
Good job.

519
00:49:06,180 --> 00:49:07,950
Let's go.

520
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:20,390
Why are you grabbing a taxi?

521
00:49:20,390 --> 00:49:23,310
Isn't it someone you need to meet without TOP's knowledge?

522
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:29,100
- If we take my car, TOP will know your movements. 
 - Right.

523
00:49:30,620 --> 00:49:33,830
But where are we going out of the blue?

524
00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:36,370
To meet the criminal.

525
00:49:36,370 --> 00:49:37,970
What?

526
00:49:47,210 --> 00:49:49,320
Inside there,

527
00:49:50,130 --> 00:49:52,850
is a person named Im Soon.

528
00:49:53,950 --> 00:49:55,950
What are you?

529
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:02,270
Visit her. I'll wait.

530
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:31,960
Seok Hui, Young Lady.

531
00:50:32,970 --> 00:50:34,910
 Young Lady. 

532
00:50:38,980 --> 00:50:42,880
Yes, ahjumma, I'm Seok Hui.

533
00:50:46,780 --> 00:50:53,040
I lived in America after that day.

534
00:50:55,790 --> 00:50:58,350
I want to know the truth.

535
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:02,620
Did you really kill my mom?

536
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:06,100
If not, then who killed her?

537
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:10,380
I don't know. I really don't know.

538
00:51:10,380 --> 00:51:14,190
When I came in, the chairman's wife was already...

539
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:47,190
That person isn't the criminal.

540
00:51:47,190 --> 00:51:50,510
Why? She's not the kind of person who can murder someone.

541
00:51:50,510 --> 00:51:56,510
She even carefully buried a mouse that our cat had caught in a box.

542
00:51:56,510 --> 00:51:57,880
Also, she doesn't have any motive for the murder.

543
00:51:57,880 --> 00:52:02,940
Why would a person working as a housekeeper to feed their family destroy her employment?

544
00:52:02,940 --> 00:52:07,010
She doesn't even know the Korean alphabet, so she lived being looked down upon by others.

545
00:52:07,010 --> 00:52:10,260
But she's a person who said that the world is a good place to live

546
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:12,400
why would she kill a person?

547
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:17,010
You... who are you?

548
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:20,280
= I'm her son. 
 - What?

549
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:25,780
The person you just met... I'm her son.

550
00:52:31,060 --> 00:52:32,900
Then you approached me for a reason? Did TOP send you?

551
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:34,320
Did TOP send you?!

552
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:38,010
No... meeting you was a coincidence.

553
00:52:38,010 --> 00:52:40,920
Coincidence? Then tell me.

554
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:43,120
Your mom isn't the culprit, but what have you been doing?

555
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:48,700
You're the son. Even more! You're a lawyer.

556
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:51,120
I also met her for the first time yesterday.

557
00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:54,810
In 15 years.

558
00:53:54,830 --> 00:53:56,300
 Child! 

559
00:53:56,300 --> 00:53:57,880
 Child! 

560
00:53:57,880 --> 00:53:59,630
 Child! 

561
00:54:47,260 --> 00:54:49,210
 Eat. 

562
00:54:58,980 --> 00:55:03,560
My Yoon Do's clothes fit you really well.

563
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:16,130
 Do you want to be ahjussi's son? 

564
00:55:34,470 --> 00:55:41,410
Like that I became Yoon Do, the son that my father couldn't even declare dead.

565
00:55:41,410 --> 00:55:43,290
Why couldn't you meet your mom?

566
00:55:43,290 --> 00:55:45,970
She rejected my visits.

567
00:55:45,970 --> 00:55:48,630
Director Han must have threatened her.

568
00:55:48,630 --> 00:55:50,450
She's more than capable of doing that.

569
00:55:50,450 --> 00:55:51,910
My mom isn't the culprit.

570
00:55:51,910 --> 00:55:53,390
I'm the one who saw the crime scene.

571
00:55:53,390 --> 00:55:55,520
It's possible under the circumstances.

572
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:59,090
I had to become an attorney because of my mother.

573
00:55:59,090 --> 00:56:04,000
But my mother's case was wiped off the face of the earth like it never existed.

574
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:09,990
In the midst of that I met you and came this far.

575
00:56:47,100 --> 00:56:50,620
When I was dragged to the United States,

576
00:56:50,620 --> 00:56:54,800
I never thought I'd be away from Korea this long.

577
00:56:58,340 --> 00:57:01,500
Hi~

578
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:03,830
It's so good to see you!

579
00:57:17,860 --> 00:57:19,980
One shot.

580
00:57:28,610 --> 00:57:35,130
The only things I were able to do in America were eating, drinking and playing.

581
00:57:35,130 --> 00:57:38,430
All I was doing was existing.

582
00:57:48,690 --> 00:57:54,190
♫  The night everything fell apart  ♫

583
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:58,280
 There's a real criminal. 

584
00:57:59,690 --> 00:58:01,130
♫  As if inothing happened   ♫

585
00:58:01,130 --> 00:58:04,220
 If there's a real criminal, then I have to find them. 

586
00:58:04,220 --> 00:58:08,420
 The criminal who killed my mom and ruined my life. 

587
00:58:08,420 --> 00:58:10,960
 Like that, I found my life's purpose. 

588
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:14,450
 No, I made it on purpose. 

589
00:58:14,450 --> 00:58:18,250
 I no longer wanted to live like I didn't have one. 

590
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:23,670
 Have fun researching. 

591
00:58:25,290 --> 00:58:29,620
 After that, I looked up materials in the VIP room of a club. 

592
00:58:29,620 --> 00:58:32,620
 I started to study again. 

593
00:58:32,620 --> 00:58:33,610
 The page doesn't exist. 

594
00:58:33,610 --> 00:58:36,390
♫  Black Diamond  ♫

595
00:58:39,130 --> 00:58:44,590
♫  You and I to that place  ♫

596
00:58:44,590 --> 00:58:47,420
♫  Black Diamond  ♫

597
00:58:50,060 --> 00:58:54,710
♫  The Paradise for just the two of us  ♫

598
00:58:54,710 --> 00:58:56,860
Why clubbing?

599
00:58:56,860 --> 00:59:00,120
Because I had to pretend I was partying.

600
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:03,800
Because I was being watched 24/7.

601
00:59:04,510 --> 00:59:07,790
There were no articles about your mother being a murderer.

602
00:59:07,790 --> 00:59:12,370
Does it make sense that there were no articles when the daughter-in-law of a leading corporation was murdered?

603
00:59:12,370 --> 00:59:15,920
Since then, no domestic references have appeared in search results.

604
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:18,740
If I find something and clicked on it, no matter what

605
00:59:18,740 --> 00:59:21,720
I'd get blocked and then soon after the site would be shut down.

606
00:59:22,590 --> 00:59:27,080
I started suspecting that there was something  there.

607
00:59:28,290 --> 00:59:32,070
I know, because I've also searched for what I can find.

608
00:59:32,070 --> 00:59:37,540
But, there was an interesting article I found.

609
00:59:38,570 --> 00:59:41,760
It was 5 years after the murder incident,

610
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:46,220
and my mother's case was mentioned in an article talking about the MC family.

611
00:59:46,220 --> 00:59:50,350
But soon after, that article disappeared.

612
00:59:51,070 --> 00:59:52,820
TOP must have done their thing,

613
00:59:52,820 --> 00:59:55,720
You asked what I wanted, right?

614
00:59:56,630 --> 01:00:01,900
What I want is the truth of the murder incident.

615
01:00:01,900 --> 01:00:05,060
So that's why I wanted TOP.

616
01:00:05,060 --> 01:00:10,070
TOP has controlled and surveilled me

617
01:00:10,070 --> 01:00:14,080
so that I can't do what I really want to do.

618
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:17,480
So after TOP gets into my hands,

619
01:00:18,540 --> 01:00:20,770
I'm going to crush it.

620
01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:27,860
I don't think you feel differently from me.

621
01:00:27,860 --> 01:00:29,680
I waited 15 years.

622
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:32,300
The statute of limitations hasn't expired, right?

623
01:00:35,290 --> 01:00:39,880
First, I need to be elected as CEO.

624
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:45,700
Hello, this is a News Patch exclusive interview.

625
01:00:45,700 --> 01:00:49,570
We have Mo Seok Hui, who recently inherited all assets from MC.

626
01:00:49,570 --> 01:00:52,860
MC Group's major shareholder and nominee for the next CEO,

627
01:00:52,860 --> 01:00:55,170
Mo Seok Hui is here with us. Hello.

628
01:00:55,170 --> 01:00:57,340
Hello, I'm Mo Seok Hui.

629
01:00:57,340 --> 01:01:01,100
We're doing a live-streaming interview today

630
01:01:01,100 --> 01:01:03,920
and the audience interest is really explosive.

631
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:06,430
There's a lot of people watching.

632
01:01:06,430 --> 01:01:09,670
Thank you for your interest.

633
01:01:09,670 --> 01:01:14,090
Seok Hui, you've been under a veil because you haven't done anything in Korea.

634
01:01:14,090 --> 01:01:19,830
You've become the third richest female in Korea, as soon as you came back from the United States.

635
01:01:19,830 --> 01:01:22,290
So that's why there would be misunderstanding.

636
01:01:22,290 --> 01:01:27,030
Yes, I heard you paid 800 billion won in gift taxes

637
01:01:27,030 --> 01:01:30,000
without using any exemptions.

638
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:34,420
Where there are profits, there are taxes. It's a natural thing to do.

639
01:01:34,420 --> 01:01:38,220
I will work fairly to follow the previous CEO Mo Wang Pyo's

640
01:01:38,220 --> 01:01:43,210
honesty, modesty, respect for people and business philosophy.

641
01:01:43,210 --> 01:01:45,330
Cut! Okay, that was good.

642
01:01:45,330 --> 01:01:47,190
It was great.

643
01:01:47,190 --> 01:01:50,290
Thank you so much for keeping your promise on the exclusive interview today.

644
01:01:50,290 --> 01:01:55,590
I'm so happy with the viewer count and reactions we've gotten!

645
01:01:55,590 --> 01:01:58,630
You should thank my lawyer.

646
01:02:03,020 --> 01:02:06,010
You look prettier in person.

647
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:09,820
We..should talk.

648
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:17,190
Lawyer. Thank you.

649
01:02:18,380 --> 01:02:22,730
By the way, lawyer. Do you really not know me?

650
01:02:22,730 --> 01:02:24,490
I don't know you.

651
01:02:24,490 --> 01:02:28,760
No, no. I can smell something.

652
01:02:29,510 --> 01:02:33,220
A smell of an old memory.

653
01:02:33,220 --> 01:02:37,600
We met before, certainly.

654
01:02:41,460 --> 01:02:44,880
Lawyer, lawyer!

655
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:48,150
Your article about MC family's behind talk, it was good.

656
01:02:48,150 --> 01:02:50,320
How did you read it? It was deleted.

657
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:54,350
I was lucky,. I read it right after the upload.

658
01:02:54,350 --> 01:02:55,500
Then it  disappeared.

659
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:59,290
I got fired because of that article, and I'm here, being punished.

660
01:02:59,290 --> 01:03:02,220
The comment that Mo Seok Hui is in New York, that was posted by me.

661
01:03:02,220 --> 01:03:04,390
Your nickname is Twistedmental?

662
01:03:04,390 --> 01:03:07,620
Yes. I was following your SNS.

663
01:03:07,620 --> 01:03:10,290
What to do! We are going to run into each other often.

664
01:03:10,290 --> 01:03:12,380
I agree.

665
01:03:27,160 --> 01:03:29,610
News Patch is fast.

666
01:03:29,610 --> 01:03:33,440
Other news agencies got a hold of the article and uploaded it already.

667
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:36,410
Mostly it's positive, not bad.

668
01:03:36,410 --> 01:03:40,160
But earlier, what were you talking about with Reporter Kim Boo Gi?

669
01:03:41,010 --> 01:03:45,620
The deleted article. He wrote it.

670
01:03:45,620 --> 01:03:47,440
Yeah?

671
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:51,260
He is an important person we'll do give and take with from now on.

672
01:04:00,260 --> 01:04:02,720
Check with Reporter Kim.

673
01:04:07,020 --> 01:04:09,110
Nothing is confirmed yet!

674
01:04:09,110 --> 01:04:12,610
Reporter Kim! Don't write the article haphazardly.

675
01:04:12,610 --> 01:04:15,200
Hello, hello?

676
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:18,900
How dare they use the press when the shareholders meeting hasn't even happened yet!

677
01:04:18,900 --> 01:04:20,500
"A Cinderella has appeared in the business world."

678
01:04:20,500 --> 01:04:23,760
"Granddaughter of the MC Group shrouded in a veil."

679
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:25,990
"A next generation leader with both beauty and intelligence."

680
01:04:25,990 --> 01:04:28,420
" Is MC Group's battle over shares over?"

681
01:04:28,420 --> 01:04:31,490
Articles from a bunch of places are coming up after News Patch's article.

682
01:04:31,490 --> 01:04:33,360
Let's start our retaliation.

683
01:04:33,360 --> 01:04:35,250
Show me the analysis on our shareholders.

684
01:04:35,250 --> 01:04:37,020
Yes.

685
01:04:38,060 --> 01:04:41,580
Most of our shareholders are in their 50s and are conservative.

686
01:04:41,580 --> 01:04:43,330
We need to release an article catering to them.

687
01:04:43,330 --> 01:04:46,290
I'll reveal how much she spent on clubs in New York.

688
01:04:46,290 --> 01:04:48,300
Title would be "Club Mania Mo Seok Hui".

689
01:04:48,300 --> 01:04:51,560
- We have an anonymous caller, too.
 - Good.

690
01:04:51,560 --> 01:04:55,380
Oh, and Miss has gone to a gathering supporting same sex marriage, right?

691
01:04:55,380 --> 01:04:56,220
Yes.

692
01:04:56,220 --> 01:04:57,920
Make it so that the shareholders who are conservative

693
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:00,540
can't trust Mo Seok Hui as a CEO.

694
01:05:00,540 --> 01:05:02,110
- Okay? 
 - Yes.

695
01:05:02,110 --> 01:05:05,470
Instead, retaliatory article will be released on the day of the stockholders meeting.

696
01:05:05,470 --> 01:05:07,450
What?

697
01:05:07,450 --> 01:05:10,090
There's a good reason for it.

698
01:05:20,370 --> 01:05:22,240
All done?

699
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:24,020
Just a second.

700
01:05:26,570 --> 01:05:28,420
Read this.

701
01:05:30,570 --> 01:05:33,200
I, Mo Seok Hui, who studied in the US since an early age

702
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:35,550
became a global individual...

703
01:05:35,550 --> 01:05:39,510
and a person of upright char--

704
01:05:39,510 --> 01:05:44,590
upright and an international sense.

705
01:05:46,590 --> 01:05:48,870
Your writing really sucks, Lawyer Heo.

706
01:05:48,870 --> 01:05:52,940
Speeches are supposed to be like that. You just don't know.

707
01:05:53,720 --> 01:05:55,920
It's not my style.

708
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:59,620
Do it your way then. In Mo Seok Hui's style.

709
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:07,090
Enjoy today as if you're going to die tomorrow.

710
01:06:07,090 --> 01:06:10,730
Since life is damn short.

711
01:06:10,730 --> 01:06:11,520
How about that?

712
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:14,440
You're just itching to mess this up, huh?

713
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:17,040
No. I'm being serious.

714
01:06:17,040 --> 01:06:19,530
It's better than acting like I'm modest and putting it on.

715
01:06:19,530 --> 01:06:23,160
I like the honest and confident Mo Seok Hui, too.

716
01:06:23,160 --> 01:06:27,890
But in Korea, that could work against you.

717
01:06:27,890 --> 01:06:30,730
You don't need to be too transparent.

718
01:06:31,590 --> 01:06:34,000
You said your head is not an accessory.

719
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:54,040
I, Mo Seok Hui, who studied in the US since an early age

720
01:06:54,040 --> 01:06:57,450
grew up to be a global individual,

721
01:06:57,450 --> 01:06:59,950
a person of upright--

722
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:08,890
upright character and an international sense.

723
01:07:08,890 --> 01:07:13,460
Also, following in the footsteps of my

724
01:07:13,460 --> 01:07:17,170
predecessor, Chairman Mo Wan Pyo,

725
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:26,540
I will carry out my responsibilities while putting fairness as my most valued belief.

726
01:07:26,540 --> 01:07:31,680
Inheriting Chairman Mo Wan Pyo's business philosophy of utmost respect for human beings

727
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:36,730
I will modestly adhere to your opinions and...

728
01:07:41,850 --> 01:07:44,330
Chairman is coming.

729
01:07:58,620 --> 01:08:01,900
Mo Seok Hui. I heard today's the shareholder meeting.

730
01:08:01,900 --> 01:08:03,130
Congrats.

731
01:08:03,130 --> 01:08:04,040
Serious?

732
01:08:04,040 --> 01:08:06,830
Of course!

733
01:08:06,830 --> 01:08:11,380
Who else at this table would congratulate you sincerely?

734
01:08:13,230 --> 01:08:17,290
I guess... you have no sense of your surroundings, huh?

735
01:08:17,290 --> 01:08:18,140
What did I do?

736
01:08:18,140 --> 01:08:20,820
Can you shut up? (  German: Kannst du bitte die klappe haren?) 

737
01:08:20,820 --> 01:08:23,670
Kans... What are you saying?

738
01:08:23,670 --> 01:08:25,850
- Hyung, I think it's something bad. 
 - Huh?

739
01:08:25,850 --> 01:08:30,060
Did you get that from your mother? ( German: Hast du diese verhardt von deiner Mutter?) 

740
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:41,790
Why are you speaking... Spanish so early in the morning?!

741
01:08:41,790 --> 01:08:44,590
Hyung, I think it's German.

742
01:08:44,590 --> 01:08:46,430
It's German?

743
01:08:49,290 --> 01:08:50,750
Anyway...

744
01:08:50,750 --> 01:08:54,380
Seok Hui... when you get chosen as the CEO today,

745
01:08:54,380 --> 01:08:57,860
invest tons into the arts and culture side in the future, okay?

746
01:08:57,860 --> 01:08:59,670
I put my trust in you!

747
01:08:59,670 --> 01:09:02,570
Noona, you must be so happy to be the best.

748
01:09:03,350 --> 01:09:05,910
Grandfather only likes you.

749
01:09:14,030 --> 01:09:16,660
I'll leave first.

750
01:09:16,660 --> 01:09:19,990
Seok Hui! Oh... you look totally cool today.

751
01:09:19,990 --> 01:09:21,930
You look like the CEO. Fighting!

752
01:09:21,930 --> 01:09:23,670
Fighting.

753
01:10:06,020 --> 01:10:07,530
 MC Distribution Shareholder's Meeting 

754
01:10:07,530 --> 01:10:10,760
 Subject:  Appointment of Mo Seok Hui as New CEO 

755
01:10:30,130 --> 01:10:33,350
 Mo Seok Hui 

756
01:10:39,990 --> 01:10:41,950
She's not picking up.

757
01:10:47,420 --> 01:10:49,570
We have an announcement.

758
01:10:49,570 --> 01:10:52,980
Miss Mo Seok Hui who is to be present for the appointment as the CEO

759
01:10:52,980 --> 01:10:55,790
seems to be late due to some traffic issues.

760
01:10:55,790 --> 01:10:58,890
Please wait a moment longer.

761
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:09,410
What's this? She just got caught for DUI!

762
01:11:09,410 --> 01:11:11,760
What is this?

763
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:24,770
What are you going to do now!

764
01:11:24,770 --> 01:11:27,420
Seriously!

765
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:33,410
I'll go.

766
01:12:13,060 --> 01:12:16,150
Team Leader Lee, upload the article.

 Graceful Family 
 Preview 

773
01:13:16,060 --> 01:13:18,310
Head Chairman is contacting the shareholders as well.

774
01:13:18,310 --> 01:13:20,480
Putting together an emergency board meeting?

775
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:22,920
I don't like games where there's no chance of winning either.

776
01:13:22,920 --> 01:13:23,600
Chairman.

777
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:27,030
You should have just been left as a judge. It's my karma.

778
01:13:27,030 --> 01:13:29,690
Make provisions for Director Han.

779
01:13:29,690 --> 01:13:30,730
Chairman!

780
01:13:30,730 --> 01:13:32,580
Grandfather!

781
01:13:32,580 --> 01:13:34,030
It's a promise to give up your management rights.

782
01:13:34,030 --> 01:13:36,750
Give up all the assets Head Chairman gave you, too.

783
01:13:36,750 --> 01:13:38,580
Please let Lawyer Heo stay with me.

784
01:13:38,580 --> 01:13:39,920
We'll use him at TOP.

785
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:41,680
I'll work for TOP.

786
01:13:41,680 --> 01:13:42,960
Now... really, all alone...
