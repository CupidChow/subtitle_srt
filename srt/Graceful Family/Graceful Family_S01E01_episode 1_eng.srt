00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:46,650
 2733, I am repeating.  Pull over to the right.

 Vehicle number 2733, vehicle number 2733 

10
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,840
Hey, I drank a bit of alcohol.

11
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:22,990
Hurry up!

12
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:29,390
- Current location? 
 - Teheran Street.

13
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:31,280
- The drone. 
 - It's up.

14
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,680
Let's see it.

15
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,710
Team Leader Yoon, are you there yet?

16
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:19,760
I found him.

17
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,820
- I'll follow him closely.
 - Okay.

18
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:23,520
Lead him somewhere with less people.

19
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,830
Go straight and turn right at the next traffic light,

20
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:28,230
Oh, a right turn? Okay.

21
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:49,630
Yes. We have surrounded the suspect's vehicle.

22
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:53,910
Yes. Sir, please step out.

23
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:56,390
Step out of the car! Aren't you listening?

24
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:58,500
Try and open the door on your side.

25
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,000
Get out.

26
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,930
If you continue to be uncooperative, you will be charged with obstruction of justice!

27
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:04,490
Get out fast.

28
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:06,590
Are you playing around right now?

29
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:08,070
Open the door.

30
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:10,230
Are you not getting out?

31
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:18,220
Hurry up and get out. Lower the window!

32
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:20,750
Sir? Sir?

33
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,440
I have a phone call for you.

34
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,010
Who is it?

35
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:28,160
Yes, speaking.

36
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,720
Who?

37
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:32,720
Yes, Sir.

38
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:37,420
Yes. Yes, I understand.

39
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:40,460
Come over here.

40
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:07,560
Let's go! Let's go.

41
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:12,530
 Mo Wan Soo, 36 years old, Eldest son of the MC Group 

42
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:22,250
Situation is under control.

43
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:24,610
Okay! Nice work.

44
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:28,050
But I can't see the youngest.

45
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:37,750
- Looks like he got away from the academy. 
 - When?

46
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:40,000
- 30 minutes ago. 
 - Check his location.

47
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,500
Yes.

48
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:48,530
-  An internet cafe near the academy. 
 - Connect me to Team Leader Kwon.

49
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:54,040
Team Leader Kwon, you need to get the youngest.

50
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,120
Oh, excuse me.

51
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,250
Oh...

52
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:07,880
There aren't any seats right now. What can I do?

53
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,740
What are you saying? They're vacant.

54
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,840
There's a lot.

55
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:19,570
Damn. You're terrible!

56
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,200
Hey, move your bag so we can sit.

57
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:26,500
No way.  I can't concentrate when someone's around.

58
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:30,550
- And I paid for all the seats. 
- What's with this infant?

59
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:36,670
Kiddo, you got lots of money!

60
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:39,560
- Lend me some of it. 
 - Okay.

61
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:44,110
- Okay, I'll take some. Thanks.

62
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:46,190
But when will you pay me back?

63
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:50,360
- What? 
 - If you can't pay back, you can't borrow.

64
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:54,240
- Are you a beggar? 
 - Are you an idiot?

65
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,280
You need a talking to.

66
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:02,260
- Little brat! Oh, my shoulder!

67
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:05,480
Ajussi, what are you? Let me go.

68
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,690
I said let me go this ...

69
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:16,350
Young Master, let's go.

70
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:27,560
 Mo Seo Jin, 13 years old, MC Group's youngest son 

71
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:40,400
It's hot.

72
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:46,590
Now, Let's discuss Executive Director Mo's philosophy of leadership.

73
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:48,770
Let's hear it.

74
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:59,380
Why do you keep making unnecessary moves during my interview?

75
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:03,060
The questions are also tedious and boring.

76
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:07,660
What was your goal today?  Seducing me?

77
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:10,990
If that's so, you should have been more thorough.

78
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:13,640
Overall, the dress...

79
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,840
Fashion sense is lacking.

80
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,050
Look here, Executive Director Mo.

81
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:21,200
This is blatant sexual harassment.  In place of a feature article

82
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,540
I'm going to sue you for harassment.

83
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:25,920
Do you think that you will be able to do that?

84
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:32,370
I see why Director Mo would have misunderstood.

85
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:34,250
- Pardon? 
- Reporter Choi.

86
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:37,760
How long has it been that you were hired by the Global Magazine?

87
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:42,230
- But ... what does that have to do ... 
 -The chief editor there recently got married, right? With the JK Group CEO?

88
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:46,030
The former chief editor there with YJ's, the one before that with MS Group's CEO.

89
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:50,730
And you are in a relationship with a celebrity attorney.

90
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:54,630
- Why? Are you thinking of an opportunity to change partners?
 - Look here

91
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:56,330
Team Leader Lee!

92
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:00,980
Sue?  Go ahead!

93
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,130
If you want to attract Executive Director Mo,

94
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:05,850
you should have invested your annual salary at a minimum.

95
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:08,370
What's with renting second-hand designer products?

96
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:10,560
Cheapskate.

97
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,330
Team Leader Lee,

98
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,580
let's not do these tacky interviews.

99
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:26,590
I'm sorry.

100
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:40,860
Your necklace is pretty.

101
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:47,080
 Mo Wan Joon, MC Group's second son 

102
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:17,950
 Ha Yeong Seo, Second wife of MC Group Chairman, Mo Cheol Hui 

103
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,630
- Dear. 
 - Yes.

104
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:42,720
Would you like some water?

105
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:54,320
- The watch is pretty. 
 - Oh, this. I received it as a gift.

106
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,660
Really?  Just a moment.

107
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:07,860
It's me.  I think my meeting will run a bit late today.

108
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:11,090
Because I like the river breeze here,

109
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:14,560
- I'm going to stay here a little longer. 
 - Did you hear?

110
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,630
What's the madam's  schedule  today?

111
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:21,820
According to the schedule, she should be with a bunch of friends right now.

112
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:25,030
But there is a river breeze?

113
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:29,350
Look into all of our yachts on the Han River.

114
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:30,810
Yes.

115
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:39,550
This is the marina on Han River two hours ago.

116
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:45,210
- I want him identified. 
 -I'm matching him right now.

117
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:50,160
- Contact me. 
 - Yes.

118
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,340
What about a criminal record?

119
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:58,920
 Kim Min Ho, two prior convictions for assault. 

120
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:02,760
He has a huge amount of debt.  Recently, his credit card was suspended recently.

121
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,570
 He also has a DUI. 

122
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:06,870
Okay.

123
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:08,850
Clink!

124
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:17,740
- Who is it? 
- It's okay, open the door.

125
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:35,930
Who are you? Dear?

126
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:37,490
Cellphone!

127
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:41,690
What are you guys doing now?

128
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:43,870
I'm going to call the cops!

129
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:47,930
No!

130
00:11:56,090 --> 00:12:00,450
Hey! What's this? It's a misunderstanding.

131
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:04,060
I'll explain everything. You know how much I love you!

132
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:07,880
Have your love life with the one who gave you the watch.

133
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,230
- Get rid of him.
- Honey...

134
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:12,920
By the way, that watch is fake.

135
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,790
Cheap!

136
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:34,290
There shouldn't me any more attention-getting behavior.

137
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:38,080
Because I like the river breeze I wanted to get some air.

138
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,370
Why are you so critical?

139
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,860
This is not a request.

140
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:46,380
 Owner's risk.  Like a time bomb. 

141
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:49,760
 Exploding anywhere and anytime, an abbreviation of the chaebol family. (Chaebol - Family owning a conglomerate of industries) 

142
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,930
 But we all know it's just the tip of the iceberg. 

143
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:56,020
 The true story of the powerful chaebol is completely hidden. 

144
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:59,970
 Because of these people. 

145
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:03,840
  Yoon Sang Won, Former Prosecutor, Head of the TOP Legal Department 

146

00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:54,230
  MC Group Owner Risk Management Team  

151
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:02,800
You all worked hard.

152
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:06,770
Let's wrap it up and disperse.

153
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:08,620
You worked hard.

154
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,550
  And their chief, Han Je Gook  

155
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:16,040
  Head of TOP

157
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:02,110
We arrived.

158
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:05,000
Stop drinking so much!

159
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:08,720
Hey, you arrived late.

160
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,550
You arrived?

161
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:23,420
  As long as they are there, their castle will never collapse. 

162
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:29,040
 Graceful Family 

163
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:34,600
Young Master, until the mountains turn into fields,

00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,440
and until the fields turn to sea

165
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:41,150
you promised to be with me forever...

166
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:45,060
When you see the TV,

167
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:49,100
I saw on TV that two of the same type of business can't be next to each other.

168
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:55,050
Well, if it's the same building, violation of commercial business type restriction would apply,

169
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:59,250
but in your case, the buildings are different, so it doesn't apply.

170
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:01,180
Then, what are people like me supposed to do?

171
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:05,790
They lowered the prices and took all my customers.

172
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:09,380
It's so hard to even pay next month's rent.

173
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:14,220
I ran this store to send all my children to college and everything.

174
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:18,040
Lawyer Heo, please help me.

175
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:20,740
I beg you, please save me.

176
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:23,760
What should I do?

177
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:32,420
 Code Blue. Code Blue. 
VIP Room. VIP Room. 

178
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:37,160
 Code Blue. VIP Room. 

179
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:21,020
- Okay, let's drink! 
 - Let's drink! 
 - Yeah!

180
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,140
Cheers!

181
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:33,690
 Chairman in critical condition. 

182
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:35,750
You okay?

183
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,120
So you're finally leaving?

184
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:56,810
Yeah, I have to go back to Korea. My grandpa is sick.

185
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:01,170
Will you be able to get pass the guards?

186
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:04,710
Don't worry, it's my specialty.

187
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:19,120
You are the one who created the MC group but I am the one who developed it.

188
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,960
Now that your time is over,

189
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:27,760
leave it to me,

190
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:30,890
and go in peace.

191
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:42,520
What happened all of a sudden?

192
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:47,000
The Chairman seems to have been shocked after finding out that

193
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,230
you've become a joint guardian with Miss Seok Hui.

194
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:55,800
Father really didn't forget for a moment... Seok Hui...

195
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,960
Seok Hui absolutely cannot know that Father is in critical condition.

196
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,520
If Seok Hui finds out, there is no way to stop her

197
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,920
from coming to Korea. 
 - Of course.

198
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:12,750
I'll tell the team in New York to take care of it thoroughly.

199
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:16,350
Just a second.

200
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:19,050
Hello?

201
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:21,570
What?

202
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:25,410
 TOP 
MC Group Security Agent 

203
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,050
How did it happen?

204
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:34,780
Miss Seok Hui is going to arrive tomorrow at 11 AM on a plane from New York to Seoul.

205
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:37,990
Our team is in charge of her passport, so how was she able to get on the plane?

206
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:41,370
She took the real passport and switched it with a fake one she had prepared.

207
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:45,590
This is the image of what she looked like at the airport just before boarding.

208
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:54,230
We have enough time to prepare thoroughly.

209
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:57,940
- As soon as she leaves the airport, send her back to New York. 
 - Yes, understood.

210
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,800
Come see me for a bit.

211
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:06,450
 MC Tower 

212
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:16,220
- You've been following Miss Seok Hui constantly on the phone, right? 
 - Yes.

213
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:22,200
As soon as the Chairman went into the emergency room, she got on a flight to Korea for the first time in 15 years.

214
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,460
It's a strange timing.

215
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:29,300
I will look into whether she has been in contact with any of the family members or the chairman's aides.

216
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:31,230
Quietly.

217
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:38,940
 TOP MC Group Security Agent 

218
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:51,810
Leader Kwon, I checked the passenger list again just in case,

219
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:55,430
Mo Seok Hui used a trick. She's arriving via Shanghai at Gimpo Airport.

220
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:58,190
Yeah. There's not much time, hurry up.

221
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:03,290
I'm telling the team members. Move immediately to Gimpo Airport, not Incheon Airport.

222
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:06,790
Please control the traffic in the control room.

223
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:31,590
Secure a clear view as soon as possible and promptly proceed as planned when you discover her.

224
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:35,210
 -  I discovered her. 
 - Where is she?  

225
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:52,910
Excuse me. You are Miss Mo Seok Hui, right?

226
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:54,420
What?

227
00:21:57,170 --> 00:21:58,830
I am sorry.

228
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:05,530
Look around more.

229
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,690
Madam. I think she already got away.

230
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:31,070
She's not the type to show up willingly.

231
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:36,840
Stand by for now. Check all public transportation and rental cars through airport security cameras.

232
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,830
I got it.

233
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:48,890
I found her.

234
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:09,390
  Can I not go?  

235
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:14,300
  Just let me live here with my grandfather.  

236
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:15,840
  Please?  

237
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:40,100
Wow, you want to race?

238
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:42,790
Alright, let's do it.

239
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:19,390
You have a nice car but you suck at driving.

240
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:23,190
If your hair is flying around, you should put the top down.

241
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:14,490
Aigo, I'm going to die.

242
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:18,120
What a way to beg?

243
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:26,470
What? Beg? You are completely insane, are you?

244
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:33,300
- Aigo, I'm going to die. Goodness, my head. 
- Stop!

245
00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:38,020
How much is enough?

246
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:41,790
I am really a gentle safe style driver.

247
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:47,240
But I don't know how rich she is that the first thing she said was, "How much is enough?"

248
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,680
Is she some kind of chaebol? (  Family which owns industrial conglomerate). 

249
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:52,400
Someone driving a nice car has bad manners I see.

250
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,540
Please give your name and address.

251
00:25:57,170 --> 00:25:59,610
You're continuing to remain silent.

252
00:25:59,610 --> 00:26:02,950
Miss, do you not understand Korean?

253
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:07,140
Mr. Detective, I'm definitely going to feed her rice and beans ( prison food ),

254
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:10,000
and make her pay.

255
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,630
If you keep silent like that, it could actually be worse for you.

256
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:19,270
Ah, there is no surveillance camera ( CCTV ) or black box, I'm going crazy.

257
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:24,330
I called a lawyer as requested, so please wait.

258
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:25,660
Thank you.

259
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:28,790
He's arrived just in time. Lawyer Heo!

260
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:35,520
That guy over there is looking for a lawyer. Good luck.

261
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:40,490
Hello, I am lawyer Heo Yoon Do.

262
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:42,150
Oh, you don't have to move that.

263
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:46,770
Attorney, please sue this woman right away.

264
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:55,030
I charge 30% of the settlement.

265
00:26:57,420 --> 00:27:00,490
Then, let's hear about how the accident happened.

266
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:03,140
Then miss, would you come this way for a second?

267
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:05,820
Your legs aren't well and you must have been hurt a lot.

268
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:08,370
- Yes. 
 - All over.

269
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:33,490
Manipulating the press...

270
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:39,810
 Map coverage:  When there is insufficient storage space, it stops recording videos. The black box shuts down. 

271
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,800
  Black Box?  

272
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,990
  A video recording?  

273
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:52,420
This is my business card.

274
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:55,920
You intentionally overtook and threatened my client's vehicle?

275
00:27:55,920 --> 00:28:00,200
For revenge driving is a special intimidation ... You could be charged with the special intimidation crime.

276
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,230
Special Intimidation Crime?

277
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:08,390
Don't you have anything more plausible? What a lack of imagination.

278
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:11,850
Imagination? Are you kidding?

279
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:14,390
Furthermore, you said "How much is enough?"

280
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:16,740
Looks like you handle everything with money.  Do you have that much money?

281
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:20,500
I thought he was a beggar who needed money so I asked. Why?

282
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:22,500
Do you know the insult just now is defamatory?

283
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:27,340
What's wrong with the lawyer's arrogant attitude when he recklessly sees me as the perpetrator?

284
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:31,350
Your client over there is lying.

285
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:34,220
He's shameless enough to deceive a detective and a lawyer.

286
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:36,240
Do you believe this is his first time? An accident like this?

287
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:39,180
-  Through groundless speculation ... 
 - Speculation?

288
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:44,850
This is a fact.

289
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:57,900
Korea is pretty nice. The recording of the navigation system is automatic.

290
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,960
That bastard!

291
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:07,110
You lied, didn't you?

292
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,930
You were putting on a show from the beginning.

293
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,100
Isn't it polite to apologize first?

294
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:17,640
 Fess up now! 

295
00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:21,720
You're a newbie, aren't you?

296
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:27,460
A good lawyer would have figured out the facts first, regardless of his client's statement.

297
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:32,290
But you only believed your client and were just trying to make money.

298
00:29:32,290 --> 00:29:37,840
So without any evidence you are just trying to make a deal with a fragile woman who doesn't have a guardian.

299
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,330
Why? Because I am a woman?

300
00:29:40,330 --> 00:29:42,820
Because I look younger than you?

301
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:47,490
So you thought you could straight out accuse me

302
00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:52,310
and only saw me as a foolish wench who would tremble and give anything you asked?

303
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:01,590
Think yourself lucky.

304
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:05,980
This is the first time that I've ever forgiven a stupid lawyer and a swindler.

305
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:15,500
Also, if you want to look professional, please change your clothes first.

306
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:19,800
Ahjumma! (  older lady  )

307
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,110
What?

308
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:31,910
I guess you are an ahjumma.

309
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:35,310
The style of makeup and overall feeling is exactly that of an ahjumma.

310
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:40,980
You must have put on some makeup to look pretty, so it's annoying when someone calls you an ahjumma, right?

311
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:43,920
That's why you should have worn better clothes that match your makeup.

312
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:49,120
Why? Don't you like that I following your way of judging a person by their clothing?

313
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:53,310
For your information, this precious suit was brought by my father.

314
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:55,060
It's like my alter ego.

315
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:58,810
But then, you couldn't possibly know the value of that.

316
00:30:58,810 --> 00:31:02,450
And, what?  A fragile woman ... you?

317
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:05,430
Someone who speaks informally from the first meeting and says, "How much is enough?"

318
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:07,400
Wasn't it that you wanted to end things quickly because you couldn't be bothered?

319
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:10,160
Then it would have been a win-win to settle quickly and say bye-bye.

320
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:14,480
That's for when he didn't try to scam me.

321
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:18,880
This incident was not an accident. It's a fraud case.

322
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:24,900
How dare you lecture me when you're just a newbie lawyer who hangs around the police station scavenging cases?

323
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:27,290
Why didn't you show the video at the start?

324
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:30,620
You also didn't respond to the request for a statement and played the cop when you had evidence.

325
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:33,390
That is an obstruction of justice.

326
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:35,500
Should the law be applied, really?

327
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:41,890
You seem very busy so I'll leave first.

328
00:31:59,930 --> 00:32:02,500
 Heo Yoon Do, Attorney 

329
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:11,160
Oh, she's petite but strong!

330
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:14,030
I wonder what she does for a living.

331
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:20,100
- Have you fallen for her? 
 - She's not my type.

332
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,780
It's been a while, Miss.

333
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:38,490
Executive Director Han, you don't seem to age. You're still here.

334
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:40,640
It's the Chairman's order to bring you home.

335
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:43,260
I'm going to the hospital first.

336
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:48,580
- Let me go. 
 - What is this situation?

337
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:50,760
Hey there!

338
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,410
Let me go! Let me go!

339
00:32:53,410 --> 00:32:56,200
Let go of that hand. Aren't you stopping?

340
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,330
- This is a police station here. 
 - What are you doing now?

341
00:32:58,330 --> 00:33:01,300
We don't allow kidnapping and assault.

342
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:04,360
It's a situation that could have been misunderstood. I'm sorry.

343
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:06,230
What kind of misunderstanding?

344
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:09,430
Strong arming a fragile woman... by many people!

345
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:12,240
I am her attorney.  Has the misunderstanding been resolved?

346
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:16,590
A lawyer should know better. If you pull on a woman's arm without her consent, it's an indecent assault.

347
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:18,360
Then you must know this too.

348
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:23,210
The Supreme Court in 2014 ruled that pulling a wrist or arm is not indecent assault.

349
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:25,610
Yes. But recently socially accepted ideas have changed.

350
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:28,650
If the woman feels uncomfortable, then it is an indecent assault.

351
00:33:28,650 --> 00:33:31,590
One should at least be gender sensitive. Isn't that what makes a good lawyer?

352
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:33,460
That's interesting.

353
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:35,620
Let's go, Miss.

354
00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:38,590
Take care of the rental car issue.

355
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:43,030
And I am going to my grandfather's hospital.

356
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:45,340
- You brought a car didn't you? 
 - What?

357
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:49,940
You know my rental car was in an accident.  And I am a very fragile woman.

358
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:53,410
Going their way would be the wrong direction.

359
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:59,170
- Let's go. 
 - Where?

360
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:09,900
This way.

361
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:32,600
Take me to MC Hospital.  My grandfather is in critical condition.

362
00:34:33,370 --> 00:34:36,070
But why am I naturally supposed to go?

363
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:40,320
Then you should have refused to link arms with me from the start.

364
00:34:41,310 --> 00:34:44,730
Right. As the person who's sensitive to gender issues should be the one to help.

365
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:46,200
Let's go.

366
00:35:05,330 --> 00:35:08,570
Hey there! Hey there! Hey!

367
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:16,900
What's with that rudeness?  Without a thank you or farewell. Jeez.

368
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:47,510
Miss.

369
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,930
Miss, how did you...

370
00:35:54,370 --> 00:35:56,100
Am I an uninvited guest?

371
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:57,810
Of course not.

372
00:35:58,530 --> 00:36:00,800
Please step out for a bit.

373
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,170
Yes.

374
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:40,050
Grandfather.

375
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:43,190
It's me, Seok Hui.

376
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:45,970
Seok  Hui

377
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,030
is here after 15 years.

378
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:00,310
Madame.

379
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:05,200
Miss Seok Hui came back to Korea.

380
00:37:06,810 --> 00:37:12,300
All right. Housekeeper Jeong, watch her carefully.

381
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:15,300
Seok Hui has returned to Korea?

382
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:19,070
- How did she get here when TOP was watching her? 
 - I can't say.

383
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:22,050
Things are turning out strange...

384
00:37:22,050 --> 00:37:25,810
I'm sure she didn't come to Korea to have a picnic after 15 years.

385
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:27,530
She probably came to receive her inheritance from Grandfather.

386
00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:29,350
With whose consent?

387
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:33,400
Executive Director Mo should not let your guard down either.

388
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:42,780
Good shot.

389
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,620
You can't go in.

390
00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:15,060
Did you not leave yet?

391
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:19,010
I was waiting to receive a thanks before leaving.

392
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:24,440
Well, if you want it ... Anyhow, thanks.

393
00:38:31,570 --> 00:38:35,110
I don't need your help anymore. It's all right.

394
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:36,640
Is that so?

395
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,980
Well that's a relief.

396
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:40,600
I'm going.

397
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:09,900
You only have one sister-in-law, but this must be your first time meeting her.

398
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:12,470
I hope you'll be understanding of any discourtesies that might arise.

399
00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:14,130
Pardon?

400
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:20,450
First son is entering.

401
00:39:20,450 --> 00:39:25,490
Aigoo, the car was delayed, so... Open this.

402
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:29,880
I am sorry for being late.

403
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:34,730
Your third button of your shirt isn't  buttoned.

404
00:39:34,730 --> 00:39:36,560
Pardon? Oh.

405
00:39:37,910 --> 00:39:42,340
Seriously, the main actor arrived late suddenly.

406
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:47,200
The attitudes of actors these days are a real mess.

407
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,820
Our country, too, like Hollywood, when you're late,

408
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:54,760
there should be a contractual agreement to pay a penalty.

409
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:57,660
The youngest son is entering.

410
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:06,330
Ms. Seok Hui is entering.

411
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:15,990
Oh...

412
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:20,830
What's with the manners? It's inappropriate for an uninvited guest, isn't it?

413
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:28,700
Let's sit.

414
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:31,670
Hey, Mo Seok Hui!

415
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:37,490
What's this? Were you the reason for this feast?

416
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:39,940
Nice to see you.

417
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:48,530
Let's see here. We saw each other in New York last year, right?

418
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:52,250
How is it being in Korea after 15 years?

419
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:55,190
But you've become even prettier.

420
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:57,220
Welcome.

421
00:40:59,730 --> 00:41:03,540
This is your sister-in-law. Wan Joon's wife.

422
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:07,640
You didn't come to the wedding, so they were very disappointed.

423
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:09,580
I doubt it.

424
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:12,390
I am Baek Soo Jin.

425
00:41:12,390 --> 00:41:18,240
Isn't it suffocating to only stay at home as a former general's daughter and a talented cellist?

426
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,030
You're full of bad manners at your first meeting.

427
00:41:22,030 --> 00:41:26,250
You didn't know? Bad manners is my forte.

428
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:31,080
But are you her spokesperson? You don't sound like a husband.

429
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:42,550
Hey, hey!

430
00:41:43,970 --> 00:41:46,800
- Who are you? 
 - Mo Seo Jin. Who are you?

431
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,180
Why do you speak English?

432
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:52,930
- Oppa? 
 - Huh? 
 - You made a kid without getting married?

433
00:41:52,930 --> 00:41:55,210
Huh? It's not me!

434
00:41:55,210 --> 00:41:56,870
No?

435
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,830
Speeding violation? ( Having a child before marriage) 

436
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,780
Who is your dad?

437
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:10,630
Mo Cheol Hui.

438
00:42:14,770 --> 00:42:17,260
How impressive.

439
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:21,050
Wow, wow!

440
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:24,630
She is not my mom!

441
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:41,610
I'm Mo Seok Hui. Your older sister from another mother.

442
00:42:41,610 --> 00:42:44,210
I am Mo Seo Jin.

443
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:00,270
The Chairman is entering.

444
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:11,080
What a surprise.

445
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:13,710
A handsome younger brother.

446
00:43:13,710 --> 00:43:16,060
You don't have more, do you?

447
00:43:41,930 --> 00:43:43,530
Hey.

448
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:52,090
Our main actor brought this from Cannes

449
00:43:52,090 --> 00:43:57,070
and told me to give it to you. So I brought it.

450
00:43:57,070 --> 00:44:02,490
Wow. It's your favorite, 1990 Chateau.

451
00:44:02,490 --> 00:44:05,640
Now, let's try--

452
00:44:07,170 --> 00:44:09,220
Please take it away.

453
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:12,490
I like it, though.

454
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:18,420
We should do a cheers on a day like today.

455
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:20,430
Pour us some.

456
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:35,310
What should we celebrate? A younger sibling I got after 15 years?

457
00:44:35,310 --> 00:44:39,420
Wait a minute. How many moms do I have?

458
00:44:40,250 --> 00:44:42,770
Is his mom mine, too?

459
00:44:42,770 --> 00:44:45,610
Hey, where's your mom?

460
00:45:04,270 --> 00:45:07,240
Oops, sorry.

461
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:09,960
Home sweet home.

462
00:45:10,610 --> 00:45:14,820
You are all still the same! It's so great!

463
00:45:21,210 --> 00:45:24,790
What's the reason for you returning to Korea without permission?

464
00:45:24,790 --> 00:45:27,540
Was it something I needed permission to do?

465
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:29,530
I didn't know.

466
00:45:29,530 --> 00:45:34,050
Since I wasn't there for mom's funeral, I wanted to be there for Grandfather's.

467
00:45:34,050 --> 00:45:35,710
He will get well.

468
00:45:35,710 --> 00:45:38,890
That's good. That we think alike.

469
00:45:38,890 --> 00:45:42,540
Go back in the morning.

470
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:44,320
Yes.

471
00:45:48,210 --> 00:45:52,210
I'd love to but I don't want to.

472
00:45:53,990 --> 00:45:57,030
- I'm just going to live in Korea. 
 - You can't!

473
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:05,030
I am not a minor.

474
00:46:05,030 --> 00:46:11,630
And among  the people who are sitting here, isn't it me who most deserves to be in this house?

475
00:46:18,170 --> 00:46:22,960
Isn't that right, Stepmother?

476
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:51,730
There's no camera.

477
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:26,230
 Look. 

478
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:28,210
 It looks good. 

479
00:47:28,210 --> 00:47:30,890
  Our Seok Hui is so pretty.  

480
00:47:33,630 --> 00:47:35,180
  The weather is nice.  

481
00:47:35,180 --> 00:47:37,020
  Right?  

482
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:40,810
  But mom...  

483
00:47:40,810 --> 00:47:44,420
  Why are we not living with Dad?  

484
00:47:45,110 --> 00:47:49,050
  Dad is very busy so... 

485
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:54,160
  Are you upset because Dad is not here?  

486
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:58,150
  No, I'm okay.  

487
00:47:58,150 --> 00:48:02,120
  But I wish he was a little less busy.  

488
00:48:25,590 --> 00:48:29,930
Use this phone, and I'll get you a personal assistant as soon as possible so that you won't have any inconveniences.

489
00:48:29,930 --> 00:48:33,500
So you're telling me I'm going to be watched from now on, huh?

490
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:40,070
Tell Director Han. That I'll pick an assistant that I am comfortable with.

491
00:48:40,070 --> 00:48:41,740
Yes.

492
00:48:43,180 --> 00:48:45,850
- You said you are Team Leader Lee Gyeong Ah, right?
 - Yes.

493
00:48:45,850 --> 00:48:51,020
You have  expensive taste. Is it covered by the MC's annual salary?

494
00:48:51,020 --> 00:48:54,310
Or are you working two jobs?

495
00:48:55,750 --> 00:48:57,220
Is there anything more you have to say?

496
00:48:57,220 --> 00:49:00,630
There's an ancestral rite for the 30th year of your grandmother's death.

497
00:49:00,630 --> 00:49:03,850
The women in the household conventionally have to wear a Hanbok

498
00:49:03,850 --> 00:49:05,600
so you can call the designer at any convenient time--

499
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:08,360
I'll go there in person so I can get some fresh air, too.

500
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:13,190
Korea has changed a lot in 15 years, right?

501
00:49:13,190 --> 00:49:15,880
It might be nice if you could check for yourself.

502
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:19,910
But you have to move quietly. You know, right?

503
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:24,460
It's the only thing I am good at.

504
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:31,010
  You promised your love for the rest of your life.  

505
00:49:32,150 --> 00:49:35,260
 How could you throw me away so easily? 

506
00:49:35,260 --> 00:49:37,370
I'll be--

507
00:49:39,660 --> 00:49:41,560
What?

508
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:44,660
- I'll get going. 
 - Hey, hey, hey!

509
00:49:44,660 --> 00:49:47,970
Hey, are you going again to a famous law office or

510
00:49:47,970 --> 00:49:51,010
some type of big corporation to hand in your application?

511
00:49:51,010 --> 00:49:56,240
What are you saying? I've got an appointment with a client today.

512
00:49:56,240 --> 00:50:00,160
Hey, so our lawyer Heo is finally taking over a case?

513
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:02,860
That's what I'm saying. If I keep going like this,

514
00:50:02,860 --> 00:50:05,260
then I might even get my own office soon!

515
00:50:05,260 --> 00:50:08,550
That's how it should be! You worked so hard to become a lawyer.

516
00:50:08,550 --> 00:50:12,390
I'm gonna make beef tonight so make sure your performance is good.

517
00:50:12,390 --> 00:50:16,510
- Okay! 
 - Okay! Work hard son!

518
00:50:19,180 --> 00:50:23,330
You have talent and looks.

519
00:50:23,330 --> 00:50:25,810
My son is the best.

520
00:50:25,810 --> 00:50:27,590
Young Master...

521
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:44,990
  Your Wedding  

522
00:50:50,770 --> 00:50:53,380
 Hanbok 

523
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:14,200
- You are Mo Seok Hui, right?
 - Yes.

524
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:15,730
We've received the call.

525
00:51:15,730 --> 00:51:21,180
- But because of an unexpected customer, you have to wait 10 minutes.
 - That's okay.

526
00:51:21,180 --> 00:51:23,580
Thank you. I will prepare you some tea.

527
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:25,650
Please come this way.

528
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:41,250
So...

529
00:51:41,250 --> 00:51:45,490
you're saying that the Madam of MC Group is more important than me?

530
00:51:45,490 --> 00:51:51,480
Madam Ha of MC Group pursues an elegant look and doesn't like exposure.

531
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:53,590
What?

532
00:51:56,500 --> 00:52:01,560
So you're saying that she is elegant and I'm an exhibitionist, right?

533
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:02,560
It's not that.

534
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:06,110
Oh my.

535
00:52:06,110 --> 00:52:09,230
You have a knack for irritating me like crazy.

536
00:52:09,230 --> 00:52:13,980
If you're told to do something, just do it.

537
00:52:13,980 --> 00:52:17,100
If I say peel it off, do it, do you hear?

538
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:18,650
You're just a dressmaker.

539
00:52:18,650 --> 00:52:21,590
How dare you order me around?

540
00:52:21,590 --> 00:52:24,870
Are you kidding?  Am I a joke?

541
00:52:26,490 --> 00:52:28,920
Who is this?

542
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:31,370
What is this?

543
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:36,640
I was wondering who rented a VIP room and went over the scheduled time.

544
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:38,720
It's Choi Na Ri.

545
00:52:39,590 --> 00:52:41,820
Oh, you were waiting.

546
00:52:41,820 --> 00:52:47,050
My session is not over yet so would you shut your mouth and get lost?

547
00:52:47,050 --> 00:52:50,510
You have a reputation to keep. How about you stop here?

548
00:52:50,510 --> 00:52:51,690
Who are you?

549
00:52:51,690 --> 00:52:54,070
Hurry up and finish while I'm still being nice.

550
00:52:54,070 --> 00:52:57,310
You two as a pair are just...

551
00:53:00,930 --> 00:53:03,030
Do you have a death wish?

552
00:53:03,030 --> 00:53:05,550
Hey, stay still.

553
00:53:07,650 --> 00:53:11,130
Are you shooting an action sageuk ( historical drama )?  Why are you pulling stunts?

554
00:53:11,130 --> 00:53:13,770
Do you really want to die?

555
00:53:16,950 --> 00:53:18,500
Hey!

556
00:53:21,530 --> 00:53:24,110
Come here.

557
00:53:24,110 --> 00:53:25,680
Yes.

558
00:53:27,810 --> 00:53:30,260
♫  Hey Give it to me  ♫

559
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:33,960
♫  Give it your best. Why don't you try?  ♫

560
00:53:37,220 --> 00:53:39,030
Stop right there!

561
00:53:39,060 --> 00:53:40,280
♫  Hey, give it to me.  ♫

562
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:44,540
♫  But your best can't hold me back  ♫

563
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:52,300
You're dying today. Come here. Come here.

564
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:57,200
Scaredy cat.

565
00:53:57,230 --> 00:53:59,140
♫  I'm on fire  ♫

566
00:53:59,140 --> 00:54:00,610
So annoying.

567
00:54:00,610 --> 00:54:03,050
♫  I'm on fire  ♫

568
00:54:07,230 --> 00:54:12,080
♫  You are liar.  You are liar.  ♫

569
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:14,270
Daebak!

570
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:18,130
Daebak! Daebak!

571
00:54:18,130 --> 00:54:21,020
It's Choi Na Ri!

572
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:26,010
She's in her underwear.

573
00:54:30,330 --> 00:54:32,100
Just give up!

574
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:35,620
Who is there?  Don't you know ...

575
00:54:35,620 --> 00:54:36,820
Get on with your work.

576
00:54:36,820 --> 00:54:39,790
I told you to stop.

577
00:54:39,790 --> 00:54:43,090
Hey. Do you know who I am to be treating me like this?

578
00:54:43,090 --> 00:54:46,660
Let go, aren't you letting go?

579
00:54:48,340 --> 00:54:51,150
This time you are even using a weapon. 
Do you want to go to the police station again?

580
00:54:51,150 --> 00:54:54,650
This has nothing to do with you so back off.

581
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:58,100
- Are you okay? Are you injured anywhere? 
 - Oh, my back.

582
00:54:58,150 --> 00:55:01,160
For your information, my father is a big fan of yours.

583
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:05,420
Oh really? Nice to meet you. Thank you so much.

584
00:55:05,420 --> 00:55:06,360
Aren't you letting go?

585
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:10,270
It's understandable to be jealous of a girl who is prettier than you, but isn't this childish?

586
00:55:10,270 --> 00:55:12,090
Watching you earlier, it seems you've been working out.

587
00:55:12,090 --> 00:55:15,050
Do you know a blackbelt holder using a deadly weapon can be charged with special assault?

588
00:55:15,050 --> 00:55:19,090
It's okay. It will be my first offense and I have a lot of money.

589
00:55:20,190 --> 00:55:21,600
Oh my gosh, are you okay?

590
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:23,410
Where do you think you are going?

591
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:25,710
Let go.

592
00:55:25,710 --> 00:55:27,750
Where are you going?

593
00:55:50,090 --> 00:55:51,030
Hello.Wait a moment.

594
00:55:51,030 --> 00:55:52,730
Where are we going?

595
00:55:52,730 --> 00:55:54,510
Hurry and take a look.

596
00:55:54,510 --> 00:55:56,060
Go on in.

597
00:55:56,060 --> 00:55:58,200
Hey, report it.

598
00:56:00,210 --> 00:56:02,900
Director Han,  why are you only coming now?

599
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:06,430
Arrest this woman immediately!

600
00:56:06,430 --> 00:56:10,080
But why did TOP come?

601
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:13,150
What is this situation?

602
00:56:13,150 --> 00:56:18,090
She is Mo Seok Hui, the only daughter of President Mo Cheol Hui.

603
00:56:18,850 --> 00:56:21,390
Oh my.

604
00:56:21,390 --> 00:56:26,720
So the one who's been living in New York for 15 years? That idio--

605
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:33,300
No but why does TOP care about this woman?

606
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:38,710
She's an exclusive model of MC Group, so we are supporting her as though she were a family member.

607
00:56:39,670 --> 00:56:42,800
It's not a support but more a sponsor.

608
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:45,970
Who does she belong to? Oppa Wan Soo?

609
00:56:45,970 --> 00:56:50,950
Mo Wan Joon? Or... Father?

610
00:56:51,910 --> 00:56:53,060
It's nothing like that.

611
00:56:53,060 --> 00:56:58,090
I don't care whose woman she is but you better pick a woman who is qualified..

612
00:56:58,090 --> 00:57:01,380
What? Are you done talking?!

613
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:02,800
Did you even graduate from elementary school?

614
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:07,200
You must've learned to wait for your turn.Or did you forget because you are dumb?

615
00:57:33,690 --> 00:57:39,230
If you sign this agreement now, we will give you cash here and now.

616
00:57:39,230 --> 00:57:44,150
But if you're telling anyone about what happened here today,

617
00:57:44,150 --> 00:57:46,840
you have to pay three times the amount as penalty.

618
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:48,010
Do you all understand?

619
00:57:48,010 --> 00:57:49,980
Yes.

620
00:57:51,940 --> 00:57:54,320
- Lee Ji Hoon? 
- Yes.

621
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:56,080
Ha Jae Woo.

622
00:57:57,110 --> 00:57:59,580
Yoon Jeong Hoon.

623
00:57:59,580 --> 00:58:01,630
Kim Seong Gyeong.

624
00:58:17,630 --> 00:58:19,660
It's not our first time meeting.

625
00:58:19,660 --> 00:58:22,410
Yes. I will not sign.

626
00:58:22,410 --> 00:58:24,160
- Is the settlement money not enough? 
 - Oh, no.

627
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:26,420
I didn't take pictures.

628
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:31,540
But you were a witness. You have to sign the agreement   so we can be at ease.

629
00:58:31,540 --> 00:58:37,600
Just because you want me to sign, doesn't mean I have to sign.

630
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:40,960
I'm a fan of Choi Na Ri so there is no reason for me to start rumors.

631
00:58:42,540 --> 00:58:43,730
Excuse me.

632
00:58:43,730 --> 00:58:45,580
Yes, sir.

633
00:58:52,510 --> 00:58:56,750
What? What did you say?

634
00:58:56,750 --> 00:59:00,300
You're suddenly raising the security deposit?

635
00:59:00,300 --> 00:59:04,590
We're going through a hard time running the business, as well. Please consider...

636
00:59:04,590 --> 00:59:06,580
H-hello?

637
00:59:11,930 --> 00:59:13,950
What's wrong?

638
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:17,880
What else?

639
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:20,990
You need money. But why are you bluffing?

640
00:59:20,990 --> 00:59:23,410
You keep speaking informally.

641
00:59:23,410 --> 00:59:28,920
I only take money that I earned fairly. There are people like that in this world, got it?

642
00:59:34,380 --> 00:59:38,150
Call me. I'll give you a lot of money. Let's work together.

643
00:59:55,860 --> 00:59:59,690
So Choi Na Ri is the kid Seo Jin's mother.

644
01:00:00,790 --> 01:00:02,810
Is there another younger sibling I don't know about?

645
01:00:02,810 --> 01:00:04,750
There isn't.

646
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:09,480
I figured. Nothing that  Director Han doesn't know about, right?

647
01:00:38,420 --> 01:00:41,510
Father, if it's hard, you should stop the business.

648
01:00:41,510 --> 01:00:43,830
What do you mean it's hard...

649
01:00:43,830 --> 01:00:45,980
It's just you are old now.

650
01:00:45,980 --> 01:00:50,400
If I get a job at a law firm soon, I'll earn a lot of money. It would be good if you rest a bit.

651
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:53,420
Did the case that you took over not go well?

652
01:00:54,130 --> 01:01:00,170
I sold pork to raise you, buy you clothes, and send you to college.

653
01:01:00,170 --> 01:01:05,890
There are a lot of regular customers so we should keep working as much as we can.

654
01:01:05,890 --> 01:01:09,610
Did you talk to the owner of the building?

655
01:01:09,610 --> 01:01:14,110
I told him that he should talk to you about the deposit.

656
01:01:14,110 --> 01:01:19,660
I was so confident because my son is a lawyer.

657
01:01:19,660 --> 01:01:23,760
They were too nervous to ask to raise the deposit, right?

658
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:26,660
Yeah well, they didn't say much.

659
01:01:58,860 --> 01:02:02,390
 Chairman in critical condition. 

660
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:07,770
They keep texting me with the same number.

661
01:02:07,770 --> 01:02:10,090
Who could it be...

662
01:02:13,860 --> 01:02:15,800
  Call me. I'll give you a lot of money.  

663
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:17,820
  Let's work together.  

664
01:02:35,070 --> 01:02:39,410
I must be crazy. Why would I believe that nut case?

665
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:46,710
 010-531-2011 

666
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:51,390
- Hel─ 
 - Why are you not calling?

667
01:02:51,390 --> 01:02:54,100
- Let's meet tomorrow. 
 - What?

668
01:02:57,030 --> 01:02:58,860
Please find the owner of this phone number.

669
01:02:58,860 --> 01:03:00,250
You can just call the person and see for yourself.

670
01:03:00,250 --> 01:03:04,710
If I could call them, I wouldn't have a reason to leave it to you, would I?

671
01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:12,150
It's a stalker that has been sending me messages for 10 years... It's always turned off.

672
01:03:12,940 --> 01:03:15,370
I am a lawyer, not a private detective agency.

673
01:03:15,370 --> 01:03:19,230
You are not that great of a lawyer.

674
01:03:19,230 --> 01:03:21,100
You have a lot of skilled lawyers. Ask them.

675
01:03:21,100 --> 01:03:25,460
Excuse me? Do you have a bad memory? Are you stubborn?

676
01:03:25,460 --> 01:03:30,560
Don't you think there is a reason why I am leaving this to you?

677
01:03:31,350 --> 01:03:35,030
I am a bit more expensive lawyer than I thought. Can you handle it?

678
01:03:35,030 --> 01:03:36,930
I'll give you 10 Million Won  as a retainer. 
   (~8500$) 

679
01:03:36,930 --> 01:03:41,030
Optionally, I will hire you as my consulting lawyer.

680
01:03:42,230 --> 01:03:43,460
Really?

681
01:03:43,460 --> 01:03:47,180
Well, that's not a bad deal.

682
01:03:47,180 --> 01:03:49,330
But you have a consulting lawyer. Why are you insisting on me?

683
01:03:49,330 --> 01:03:51,760
She's an oldie.

684
01:03:53,590 --> 01:03:58,460
But the sooner, the better.

685
01:03:58,460 --> 01:04:00,900
Call your account first.

686
01:04:00,900 --> 01:04:02,730
Alright.

687
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:06,980
Please find the owner of this phone number.

688
01:04:06,980 --> 01:04:10,400
I can't. It's illegal for the police to dig up personal information.

689
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:12,860
You always say no. This is an investigation.

690
01:04:12,860 --> 01:04:16,200
My client has been stalked for 10 years.

691
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:19,190
Detective Oh, this is your chance to catch this stalking criminal.

692
01:04:19,190 --> 01:04:20,860
Is that so?

693
01:04:20,860 --> 01:04:24,880
But it's urgent.  Do it as soon as possible, Hyungnim.

694
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:27,400
I got it. Just wait.

695
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:29,120
Hyungnim ...

696
01:04:43,730 --> 01:04:48,100
It's about time for them to call. Did he just fold and go?

697
01:04:51,240 --> 01:04:53,580
Hello? Hello?

698
01:04:53,580 --> 01:04:56,030
- It's my alarm. 
- Aish.

699
01:04:56,030 --> 01:04:58,510
Change your alarm. It's confusing.

700
01:04:58,510 --> 01:05:02,640
Who's phone call are you waiting for?
 Are you digging into big news without me?

701
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:04,480
No.

702
01:05:06,500 --> 01:05:09,540
What's up with your delivery vest?

703
01:05:10,660 --> 01:05:12,130
Oh, I'm going undercover.

704
01:05:12,130 --> 01:05:15,280
It's going to take a few days so don't look for me. And eat well.

705
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:16,750
Undercover? Who?

706
01:05:16,750 --> 01:05:19,250
I don't wan't to tell you.

707
01:05:19,250 --> 01:05:22,630
Even Newspatch is a great and flexible company to work for

708
01:05:22,630 --> 01:05:25,150
I'm the boss so I should know what items you're doing.

709
01:05:25,150 --> 01:05:26,990
Especially since there are only two employees.

710
01:05:26,990 --> 01:05:29,900
Okay, fine. I'll report it.

711
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:38,500
Recently, I saw Lee Byung Soo with Choi Soo Jong, who made a movie together,  on an entertainment show,

712
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:42,840
I think the vibe between them is a little bit strange.

713
01:05:43,900 --> 01:05:44,820
So?

714
01:05:44,820 --> 01:05:48,250
I don't think they are just coworkers.

715
01:05:48,250 --> 01:05:49,660
So I'm going to dig into this.

716
01:05:49,700 --> 01:05:52,680
If you continue to dig, the floor will emerge.

717
01:05:52,680 --> 01:05:57,690
Then, if you cover it up again, dig, cover, dig, cover, dig cover, your salary will emerge.

718
01:05:57,690 --> 01:05:59,290
What is this?

719
01:05:59,290 --> 01:06:01,720
It sounds like you're completely making fun of my gut feeling.

720
01:06:01,720 --> 01:06:04,010
Making fun? No, I'm just having no expectation.

721
01:06:04,010 --> 01:06:06,520
What are you gonna do if I decide to really dig into this?

722
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:10,720
Hello? Yes, It's reporter Kim Boo Gi.

723
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:12,430
Where?

724
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:25,250
I'm reporter Kim Boo Gi of Newspatch.

725
01:06:25,250 --> 01:06:28,330
You are Mr. Park from MC Group, right?

726
01:06:28,330 --> 01:06:29,260
Yes.

727
01:06:29,260 --> 01:06:32,010
First, let's move to a safer location.

728
01:06:40,950 --> 01:06:45,130
The Miss received a text from Korea before boarding the plane.

729
01:06:45,130 --> 01:06:49,320
But it wasn't from one of our phones. It was a burner phone.

730
01:06:49,320 --> 01:06:52,190
I'll look into it further.

731
01:06:52,190 --> 01:06:54,230
Okay.

732
01:06:55,490 --> 01:06:58,550
A burner phone....

733
01:06:58,550 --> 01:07:00,170
Burner phone?

734
01:07:00,170 --> 01:07:03,180
I'ts a phone that usually criminals get using another person's identity

735
01:07:03,180 --> 01:07:04,990
Then, what about the owner of the phone number?

736
01:07:04,990 --> 01:07:06,210
They passed away.

737
01:07:06,210 --> 01:07:11,030
But the strange thing about this number is there's no calling history after having been activated.

738
01:07:11,030 --> 01:07:14,360
The location of where the text came from was near Seongbuk-dong.

739
01:07:14,360 --> 01:07:18,080
Seongbuk-dong? That's my neighborhood.

740
01:07:18,080 --> 01:07:20,080
Is there anyone who comes to mind?

741
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:22,790
What? No. Good job.

742
01:07:22,790 --> 01:07:24,650
Let's write the contract tomorrow.

743
01:07:24,650 --> 01:07:26,560
I'll call you.

744
01:07:27,300 --> 01:07:29,050
Good-bye!

745
01:07:38,620 --> 01:07:40,960
The meat is too salty.

746
01:07:42,500 --> 01:07:44,900
Father, I said the meat is too salty.

747
01:07:45,840 --> 01:07:47,990
The meat is salty.

748
01:07:48,820 --> 01:07:50,710
It is.

749
01:07:51,560 --> 01:07:53,970
Hello, this is Lawyer Heo Yoon Do.

750
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:57,410
An interview with MC Group?

751
01:08:03,290 --> 01:08:05,700
Yoon Do. Yoon Do.

752
01:08:05,700 --> 01:08:08,490
Is it really MC Group?

753
01:08:08,490 --> 01:08:11,690
You applied there such a long time ago. 
They never contacted you, and then suddenly...

754
01:08:11,690 --> 01:08:15,560
Law firms or lawyers transfer a lot, so T.Os (personnel changes)  happen frequently.

755
01:08:15,560 --> 01:08:16,630
Really?

756
01:08:16,630 --> 01:08:21,450
Then what about you agreeing to be a legal advisor?

757
01:08:21,450 --> 01:08:24,720
Being a personal lawyer is not important. I have to do the MC Group interview first.

758
01:08:24,720 --> 01:08:26,270
But still, you promised...

759
01:08:26,270 --> 01:08:28,850
Again with your ocean of sympathy.

760
01:08:28,850 --> 01:08:32,710
I haven't signed a contract yet, so there's no problem legally or ethically.

761
01:08:32,710 --> 01:08:34,020
I got it.

762
01:08:34,020 --> 01:08:36,220
Anyway, do well. I'm sure you'll do well.

763
01:08:36,220 --> 01:08:37,870
I have a good feeling. Fighting!

764
01:08:37,870 --> 01:08:39,770
Fighting!

765
01:08:41,080 --> 01:08:42,190
I'll be back, Father.

766
01:08:42,190 --> 01:08:44,560
Okay.

767
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:48,670
  MC Tower  

768
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:06,200
Heo Yoon Do. He passed the last bar exam,

769
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:08,790
and he came out of a local university instead of SKY. (top universities, Seoul, Korea, and Yeonsei)

770
01:09:08,790 --> 01:09:13,130
His father has been self-employed after several business failures and declaring bankruptcy.

771
01:09:13,130 --> 01:09:18,860
He owns a pork bbq restaurant and has been paying off his debt slowly since 2017.

772
01:09:18,860 --> 01:09:22,850
If you look at his income tax report, the business isn't bad

773
01:09:22,850 --> 01:09:25,730
but he has a lot of debt which left him with not much to live on,

774
01:09:25,730 --> 01:09:28,850
so right now, Lawyer Heo Yoon Do has a desk in the corner of the restaurant

775
01:09:28,850 --> 01:09:32,240
and uses it as his office.

776
01:09:32,240 --> 01:09:34,600
Are you really going to accept him?

777
01:09:37,810 --> 01:09:42,680
It's a fresh idea to have one person like him in an elite group.

778
01:09:43,440 --> 01:09:47,970
Also, is there anyone here who wants to manage Miss Mo Seok Hui?

779
01:09:48,940 --> 01:09:53,500
Having him be in exclusive charge of her doesn't hurt us.

780
01:09:53,500 --> 01:09:56,110
Miss is coming in!

781
01:10:01,390 --> 01:10:04,360
What rating does Laywer Heo have?

782
01:10:05,330 --> 01:10:09,480
I had a high expectation that TOP would be different in how they hire people.

783
01:10:09,500 --> 01:10:16,400
I guess I overestimated. It's tacky and old fashioned.

784
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:18,660
Lawyer Heo Yoon Do is here.

785
01:10:18,660 --> 01:10:20,730
Let him in.

786
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:25,360
Hello. Hello.

787
01:10:26,780 --> 01:10:28,410
How are you...

788
01:10:28,410 --> 01:10:31,320
Welcome.

789
01:10:31,320 --> 01:10:33,150
Huh? Why are you here?

790
01:10:33,150 --> 01:10:36,310
I wonder why I'm here.

791
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:41,220
That's Miss Mo Seok Hui, the only daughter of MC Group's Chairman, Mo Cheol Hui.

792
01:10:41,220 --> 01:10:42,820
Pardon?

793
01:10:49,550 --> 01:10:51,900
It's an emergency.

794
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:06,990
Bring back my daughter!

795
01:11:08,690 --> 01:11:11,220
You murderers!

796
01:11:11,220 --> 01:11:14,590
My daughter, bring her back!

797
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:18,300
These murderers! Don't come near me! Don't come near me!

798
01:11:18,350 --> 01:11:21,380
I will jump and die! Don't come near me!

799
01:11:21,380 --> 01:11:23,620
  Kim Du Man  

800
01:11:23,620 --> 01:11:25,640
Kim Du Man is 54 years old.

801
01:11:25,640 --> 01:11:28,320
His daughter was employed by our copper factory in 2015

802
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:30,580
but she died from an accident last year.

803
01:11:30,580 --> 01:11:34,590
He filed an industrial accident suit, but it wasn't accepted, so  it seems that he's protesting.

804
01:11:34,590 --> 01:11:38,570
It's considered an unlawful protest since he's trespassing on a privately-owned land, so charging him is possible.

805
01:11:38,570 --> 01:11:43,190
We've already covered three nearby news outlets, and if we end this within 10 minutes, it won't get leaked out to the press.

806
01:11:43,190 --> 01:11:44,750
- Okay. 
 - We got it.

807
01:11:44,750 --> 01:11:46,370
Here.

808
01:11:47,770 --> 01:11:49,820
 Kim Du Man 

809
01:12:03,190 --> 01:12:06,410
Bring back my daughter!

810
01:12:07,560 --> 01:12:10,230
You murderers!

811
01:12:10,230 --> 01:12:13,160
My daughter! Bring her back!

812
01:12:13,160 --> 01:12:15,370
Don't approach me! Don't approach me!

813
01:12:15,370 --> 01:12:17,900
I'll jump off and die!

814
01:12:17,900 --> 01:12:20,690
Don't approach me, don't approach me.

815
01:12:20,690 --> 01:12:22,060
Mister Kim Du Man!

816
01:12:22,060 --> 01:12:25,840
Don't approach me, don't approach me.

817
01:12:27,380 --> 01:12:31,870
You have trespassed on privately-owned property and are making an illegal protest!

818
01:12:31,870 --> 01:12:34,640
If you stop now, we won't make any issue of it!

819
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:37,370
Don't be ridiculous! Do you know how I feel?

820
01:12:37,370 --> 01:12:39,870
No, I don't!

821
01:12:39,870 --> 01:12:43,830
But if you die, not only your daughter,

822
01:12:43,830 --> 01:12:46,800
but I know you'll also lose your son!

823
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:50,050
After Moon Wha died, if his father goes to jail, too,

824
01:12:50,050 --> 01:12:52,760
what will you do about your bright son?!

825
01:12:52,760 --> 01:12:54,970
You need to think about your son!

826
01:12:54,970 --> 01:12:59,020
We'll take care of your son's education!

827
01:13:03,470 --> 01:13:05,320
Really?

828
01:13:05,320 --> 01:13:06,790
Of course!

829
01:13:06,790 --> 01:13:10,640
You just need to come down from there!

830
01:13:31,270 --> 01:13:32,210
Drag him out!

831
01:13:32,210 --> 01:13:33,860
What?

832
01:13:35,020 --> 01:13:36,320
What are you doing, you bastards?

833
01:13:36,320 --> 01:13:38,030
What? What are you doing?

834
01:13:38,030 --> 01:13:40,450
Did you fool me?

835
01:13:40,450 --> 01:13:42,910
Let go!

836
01:13:42,910 --> 01:13:45,490
Let me go!

837
01:13:51,250 --> 01:13:55,760
The fact that the rooftop was accessible means the security of this building is severely lacking.

838
01:13:55,760 --> 01:13:57,700
We'll make sure it never happens again.

839
01:13:57,700 --> 01:14:00,690
You're not in charge of mistakes.

840
01:14:19,700 --> 01:14:22,540
You can't send someone away like that.

841
01:14:22,540 --> 01:14:27,720
Then? What can you do for him?

842
01:14:28,990 --> 01:14:31,410
You have to hear him out.

843
01:14:31,410 --> 01:14:34,340
You have to listen to how he's been wronged, at least.

844
01:15:05,060 --> 01:15:07,530
♫  Hey. Give it to me.  ♫

845
01:15:07,530 --> 01:15:11,160
♫   Give it your best. Why don't you try?  ♫

846
01:15:14,970 --> 01:15:17,700
♫  Hey. Give it to me.  ♫

847
01:15:17,700 --> 01:15:21,140
♫  But your best can't hold me back.  ♫

848
01:15:34,390 --> 01:15:40,400
♫ I'm on fire. I'm on fire. ♫

849
01:15:44,450 --> 01:15:48,900
♫  You are liar. You are liar.  ♫

850
01:15:48,900 --> 01:15:52,600
I was conned.  I was conned.

851
01:15:59,740 --> 01:16:02,160
Excuse me! Excuse me!

852
01:16:05,090 --> 01:16:08,120
Scammers!

853
01:16:08,120 --> 01:16:13,730
♫ I'm on fire. I'm on fire. ♫

854
01:16:18,140 --> 01:16:23,650
♫  .You are liar. You are liar.  ♫

855
01:16:42,020 --> 01:16:49,140


856
01:16:49,200 --> 01:16:54,400
♫  Black Diamond.  ♫

857
01:16:54,530 --> 01:17:00,400
♫  You and I to that place  ♫

858
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:05,500
♫  Black Diamond.  ♫

859
01:17:05,530 --> 01:17:07,190
  Graceful Family  

860
01:17:07,190 --> 01:17:10,730
The person standing there is my personal lawyer.

861
01:17:10,730 --> 01:17:13,960
How did you become the lawyer of Seok Hui who's the most picky in the family?

862
01:17:13,960 --> 01:17:14,790
Why me of all people

863
01:17:14,790 --> 01:17:17,540
Director Han's file doesn't have a third-rate lawyer like Lawyer Heo.

864
01:17:17,540 --> 01:17:19,730
You're saying you'll pay me this much?

865
01:17:19,730 --> 01:17:20,690
I'll sign it.

866
01:17:20,690 --> 01:17:22,350
Ask for whatever you want in damages.

867
01:17:22,350 --> 01:17:24,890
I have a lot of money. This lawyer will take care of it.

868
01:17:24,890 --> 01:17:28,920
Don't forget that I'm your immediate superior.  And you can't share TOP's intelligence with her either.

869
01:17:28,920 --> 01:17:31,600
I know very well how scary TOP is.

870
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:32,950
How is Seok Hui?

871
01:17:32,950 --> 01:17:35,160
I don't think she's completely uninterested in management.

872
01:17:35,160 --> 01:17:37,860
Becoming a member of TOP that you don't know about...

873
01:17:37,860 --> 01:17:41,580
Mo Seok Hui needs to be sent far away.
