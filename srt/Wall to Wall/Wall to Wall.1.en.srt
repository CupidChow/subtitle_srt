00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:37,702
The downstairs neighbors
keep on leaving notes on my door.

173
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:40,204

- <i>Yep.</i>

What do think you're doing?

My son's in eighth grade,
and my daughter's a senior.

219
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:48,976
You know how it is.
They're extremely sensitive.

220
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:52,396
The kids need their sleep,
and it just gets so noisy late at night.

221
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:55,649
I wrote it all in the notes.

222
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:58,944
I'm telling you,
it's not coming from my place.

223

So, seriously,

231
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:27,807

What are you doing?

236
00:13:41,695 --> 00:13:43,614
You better listen close.

237
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:47,076
If my husband comes here, you'll be sorry.

238
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,203
Are… I mean…

239
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:51,747
Are you th… threatening me right now?

240
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:55,251
Just showing my concern.

241
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:58,629
[Woo-sung] Hey, lady.

242
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:01,549
I told you it wasn't me.
It's not coming from here.

243
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:04,635
The vibrations and footsteps,
all of it's coming from upstairs.

244
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:06,846
What, do you wanna come inside and listen?

Just wait. Ex… excuse me.

247
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:13,519
What the hell? Oh, come on!

248
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:15,479
Are you gonna pay for my electricity?

249
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:16,605
Your shoes.

250
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:18,399
Take them off!

251
00:14:18,482 --> 00:14:19,316
Get out.

252
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:21,777
It's quiet.

253
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:28,200
Wait. It was really noisy a second ago.

254
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:34,206
Kids these days.
They never say they're fucking sorry.

255
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,377
You look down on us renters, don't you?

256
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:40,045
[Woo-sung] What?

257
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:41,463
Lady, what'd you just say?

258
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,633
[woman] I have had enough.

259
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:48,220
Oh yeah? Well, what…
what are you gonna do about it?

00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:58,314
- Seriously.

Are they purposefully doing this?

00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:28,761
[man] Can I help you?

269
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:33,015
Hi there.

270
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:35,225
I live below you. 1401.

271
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,102
Yeah, so?

272
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:42,650
M… my neighbor downstairs… at 1301
keeps complaining about noise.

273
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:48,322
Their kids, one's in eighth grade,
the other's a senior. They're sensitive.

274
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:50,324
So what?

275
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:53,869
I guess I've made this too complicated.

276
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,371
The thing is,

277
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:57,539
if you leave your phone
on the floor at night,

278
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:59,124
the vibrations can be very loud.

279
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:01,543
The same with footsteps
or moving furniture.

280
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:05,631
You probably work out.
The sound of you working out can be a lot.

281
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:06,924
Really?

282
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,303
It's been going on a while now.

283
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:14,098
Coincidentally, it started right after
you moved into this building.

284
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:16,767
So you were quietly living your life
until I moved in,

285
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:19,853
then your downstairs neighbors
started complaining about noises?

286
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:21,563
Yep.

287
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:24,108
That must be very frustrating
and annoying.

288
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:27,361
Oh, well, you know,
thanks for empathizing.

289
00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:29,196
That's how I feel right now.

290
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:30,781
What?

291
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:31,991
I was sound asleep,

292
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:34,994
then the guy downstairs
came up to tell me to be quiet.

293
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:38,497
Oh, I'm, uh…

294
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:41,583
- Did maintenance--
- I told maintenance it's not me.

295
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:46,088
I should've checked it out
before I… I talked to you.

296
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:49,591
Looks like I did the same thing they did.
I'm sorry to disturb you.

297
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:54,471
If you want to make up for it,
you could talk to the people upstairs.

298
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:55,764
Huh? Uh, me?

299
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:58,517
Every single night, with the noise.

300
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,186
Tell them they'll regret it
if they keep it up, huh?

301
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,147
Oh, you think
it's the people upstairs who--

302
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:06,608
If it's not you or me,
who else could it be? Appreciate it.

303
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:08,694
- [door closes]
- [door lock chimes]

304
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:10,738
- [sighs]
- [man 2] I said I was sorry.

305
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:13,574
I missed the alarm
because it was on vibrate.

306
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:16,493
[tense music playing]

307
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:18,037
[man 2] Yeah. I'm on my way.

308
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:19,455
Okay.

309
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:23,292
[music fades]

310
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:24,835
You scared me.

311
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:28,297
I live two floors down, on the 14th floor.

312
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,381
Okay.

313
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:31,592
Can I help you?

314
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:34,595
[Woo-sung sighs]

315
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:38,057
You really don't know why I'm here?

316
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,850
The kids are asleep by now.

317
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:42,144
And we cover the floor with mats.

318
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,480
Well, even if that's true…

319
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:46,523
NOISE-FREE HOME

320
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:52,029
Your alarms. The vibrations
of your alarms are really loud.

321
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:55,741
What are you talking about?
I can't set alarms. I'd wake my kids.

322
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:57,034
Oh, come on.

323
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:58,202
I just heard you.

324
00:17:58,285 --> 00:18:00,245
You were saying something
about missing your alarm.

325
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:02,247
Oh, were you eavesdropping?

326
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:06,919
You were talking so loud so late at night,
I couldn't help overhearing.

327
00:18:07,002 --> 00:18:10,214
I missed the alarm…
because I did not set one, okay?

328
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:12,841
- What?
- [elevator chimes]

329
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:17,137
I lied because I was embarrassed
about being late.

330
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:20,015
Really?

331
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:23,143
Listen, I hate gossip,
so I wasn't going to say anything,

332
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:25,437
but it's coming from upstairs.

333
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:26,855
You mean the 17th floor?

334
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,941
Yeah, yeah. They wake up really early.

335
00:18:29,024 --> 00:18:30,025
Are you kidding?

336
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:33,028
How can the noise from up there
make it down to 1401?

337
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,114
You should check it out yourself, then.

- [dog yapping]
- [television playing]

348
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:08,397
[man 3] What's wrong with this mutt?
Get him inside.

349
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:14,653
You never seen a walker before?

350
00:19:19,032 --> 00:19:19,950
How are you, sir?

351
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:23,287
What brings you all the way up here
at the crack of dawn?

352
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:25,372
It's about the noises.

353
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:27,833
It's quite disturbing
to the tenants below you.

354
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:30,169
Um… It'd be great if you could be quieter.

355
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:31,128
[man 3] Noises?

356
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:33,005
But I'm barely able to walk.

357
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:37,759
See, the noises are usually heard
right around the time you get up

358
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:39,261
in the, uh, early mornings.

359
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:42,556
- Especially when your phone vibrates.
- You got evidence?

360
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:43,724
What? S… sorry?

361
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:46,268
[man 3] It's bad enough
that all I can do is sit around all day,

362
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:49,146
then you accuse me
of making noise with no evidence?

363
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:52,983
A man who can barely walk
because he's disabled!

364
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:54,735
Ah. No, it's not that, sir--

365
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:59,031
Know what it was like in my day, huh?
Everyone knew where everyone else lived.

366
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:01,950
We were all understanding
and considerate of each other.

367
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:04,328
People live here.
They're gonna make noise.

368
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:06,955
- Okay, how about your dog?
- [man 3] That's ridiculous!

369
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,291
You hear Fatty barking three stories down?

370
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:11,335
Do we live in a shanty town?

371
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:14,129
Unless it's a person barking,
it must be your dog. What else--

372
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,757
If you have so much to complain about,
quit doing it here!

373
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,050
Go upstairs and do it there!

374
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:20,677
How high up do you expect me to go, sir?

375
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:22,387
To the resident representative!

376
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:24,514
Why don't you file a complaint with her?

377
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:25,474
[Woo-sung grunts]

00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:50,874
Damn it.

[music fades]

[door lock chimes]

385
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:12,062
1401, right?

386
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:15,649
Uh… uh… uh, yeah.

387
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:18,360
Uh… hello. Do I know you?

388
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:20,988
Got an intercom call from downstairs.

389
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:22,864
Said you wanted
the resident representative.

390
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:26,535
Do you want to come inside?

391
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:27,786
[beep]

392
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:41,383
So you came all the way here
from the 14th floor because of noises?

393
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:42,509
Yeah.

394
00:21:42,592 --> 00:21:46,221
Everyone kept saying to go up and up,
so… I ended up here. Sorry about that.

395
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:48,849
[sighs] Why do they always think
it's upstairs?

396
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:52,060
The building has load-bearing walls.

397
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:54,688
All of the units share the same walls.

398
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:58,692
How could anyone tell if noises
were coming from above or below?

399
00:21:58,775 --> 00:22:02,154
Ah, so what you're saying is,
the building itself is the problem?

400
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:06,616
It's not the building's fault.
The people are the problem.

401
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:08,285
Right, of course.

402
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:11,496
My downstairs neighbor
keeps leaving notes on my door.

403
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,790
I'm so frustrated. It's driving me insane.

404
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:16,877
I can take care of that.

405
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:19,713
I own the apartment below you.

406
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:23,050
Uh… It's your place? You're the landlord?

407
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:25,260
When their lease ends,
I will get them out.

408
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:28,555
- Could you give me two months?
- But you're their landlord.

409
00:22:28,638 --> 00:22:29,806
Can't you talk to them?

410
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:32,642
You can't expect me
to just wait around for two months.

411
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:35,062
Here, consider this compensation.

412
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:37,147
No, I can't accept this…

413
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:41,443
[representative] I'm not
just their landlord,

414
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:43,362
I represent the residents.

415
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:47,574
Just trying to get the weirdos
out of our building, you see.

416
00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:50,077
I'd appreciate your assistance.

417
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:54,539
Yeah, I guess that's just how it is.

418
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:57,501
I was thinking about how
wherever people are living,

419
00:22:57,584 --> 00:22:59,503
they're gonna make noises.

420
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:03,840
I knew it. Knew we'd be
on the same page, as homeowners.

421
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:06,760
Oh, I'm not really a homeowner.
The bank owns it, really.

422
00:23:07,302 --> 00:23:09,930
- I took out a lot of loans.
- They don't approve everyone though.

423
00:23:10,013 --> 00:23:14,518
- Not unless they've got potential.
- No, I don't have that much potential.

424
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:16,895
- [chuckles]
- What's your name?

425
00:23:16,978 --> 00:23:18,897
It… it's Noh Woo-sung, ma'am.

426
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,232
Do you live alone?

427
00:23:20,315 --> 00:23:22,776
Yeah. At the moment.

428
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:24,736
I'm alone, yeah. I live alone.

429
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:27,697
Holding out can't be easy.

430
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:32,702
Bet you can't sell yet. It might go up.
But no one wants to rent it either.

431
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:35,622
And people around you
are giving you the look.

432
00:23:36,998 --> 00:23:40,210
Why don't we… just keep hanging in there?

433
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:42,712
It'll get better once the GTX line's in.

434
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:46,299
You think the GTX is gonna come through?

435
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:48,009
Of course.

436
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:50,762
This complex is at a crucial juncture.

437
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:54,099
We can't have any funny business going on.

438
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,351
You know what I'm saying,

439
00:23:57,185 --> 00:23:58,019
don't you?

440
00:23:58,103 --> 00:23:58,979
Yes.

441
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:00,939
Yes, Representative.

442
00:24:01,022 --> 00:24:02,899
Anything for the good of the complex.

443
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:05,402
I'll do my best to keep hanging in there.

444
00:24:05,485 --> 00:24:07,279

Oh, what the hell is this shit?

448
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:28,550
[Crypto Poor] That's fucking creepy.

449
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:31,344
Shouldn't you report it to the police?

450
00:24:31,928 --> 00:24:33,722
That's criminal,
like blackmail or stalking.

451
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:37,851
What if that makes them even more pissed?
The representative said to be careful.

452
00:24:37,934 --> 00:24:39,728
And you're listening
'cause she gave you money?

453
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:44,232
Well, she just shelled out enough money
to cover my interest, so I'm listening.

454
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:46,693
That's like a Band-Aid
when you're hemorrhaging.

455
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:48,778
Don't get started.

456
00:24:49,696 --> 00:24:53,241
Ugh. Forget it.
I'm trying to help you out, but…

457
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,411
- What?
- Nothing. You wouldn't be interested.

458
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:58,163
- Come on, what is it?
- Interested?

459
00:24:58,246 --> 00:24:59,164
Kinda.

460
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:02,083
Okay, so last night,

461
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:05,962
I got Seo super drunk, and he told me
about his crypto signal group.

462
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:09,841
Hey! That kinda shit's
gonna get you in trouble!

463
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:12,135
You're gonna get into some pump-and-dump--

464
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:15,096
- [Crypto Poor shushing] Hey, come here!
- [muffled] What the fuck, dude?

465
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:18,934
Come on, just get over here.
I'll show you something. Look. See?

466
00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:20,810
At midnight tonight,

467
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:24,523
GB Coin will hit its low point at 815 won.

468
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:26,233
It rebounds after that.

469
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:29,319
By Liberation Day, it's up to 815%.

470
00:25:29,402 --> 00:25:31,696
That's its peak.
Then, it plummets down again.

471
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:36,743
- Wait, so buy at 815 for 815% return?
- Uh-huh.

472
00:25:36,826 --> 00:25:39,079
And GB as in <i>gwangbok</i>. Liberation Day?

473
00:25:39,162 --> 00:25:43,416
Exactly. When it hits 815%, you walk away
with nine times what you put in.

474
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,669
[chuckles softly] Oh man!

475
00:25:45,752 --> 00:25:47,712
You're such a fucking imbecile.
You buy that?

476
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:50,799
Huh? These assholes pulled off
a pump and dump.

477
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:54,219
Rora Coin. Got in at 500,
and made five times what they put in.

478
00:25:54,302 --> 00:25:56,721
This is where Seo made his money.

479
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:03,186
Except… these things are… pretty risky.
It's against the law.

480
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:05,188
Not so desperate after all, huh?

481
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:08,066
Ugh, whatever.
I'm not gonna twist your arm.

482
00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:11,069
Ugh. This is such valuable intel.

483
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:12,779
So frustrating.

484
00:26:12,862 --> 00:26:14,781
[sighs] No, it's not that.

485
00:26:15,615 --> 00:26:16,950
I have no money.

486
00:26:17,033 --> 00:26:19,244
Even if I wanted to invest,
I couldn't do it.

487
00:26:19,327 --> 00:26:22,998
It's 100% guaranteed.
Look into a private loan if you have to.

488
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:26,668
Private loan?
So I can get even deeper into debt?

489
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:29,713
[Crypto Poor] What are you talking about?
This is your way out of your debt.

490
00:26:29,796 --> 00:26:32,215
Say you borrow 80 million,
multiply that by nine.

491
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:35,385
You could pay off your entire debt
with 20 million to spare.

492
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:38,096
Ah, I don't know.
What am I supposed to do?

493
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:41,099
I shouldn't do a private loan.
Not for something so risky!

494
00:26:42,058 --> 00:26:43,184
You serious?

686
00:38:12,873 --> 00:38:15,501
Ugh. My gosh, seriously.

687
00:38:15,584 --> 00:38:17,044
Oh, this is driving me crazy.

688
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:19,880
Why does it get quiet
whenever someone comes over? Jeez.

689
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:22,133
Is this really a coincidence?

690
00:38:22,216 --> 00:38:23,467
Oh, I know, right?

691
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:26,637
It drives me crazy too.
It's almost like someone is watching.

692
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:28,389
Who would be watching?

693
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:29,473
I think…

694
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:32,727
It's the people downstairs.

695
00:38:33,936 --> 00:38:35,313
- Downstairs?
- Yes.

696
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:38,274
You'll know when you see them.

697
00:38:38,357 --> 00:38:40,985
But I don't think
they're in their right minds.

698
00:38:41,068 --> 00:38:45,072
They might be trying to get back at me.
You wanna go talk to them?

699
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:48,451
Oh, so the noise downstairs
comes all the way to my place?

700
00:38:48,534 --> 00:38:51,287
You probably don't know this,
but this building…

701
00:38:51,912 --> 00:38:56,000
This wall here, it's a load-bearing wall
that runs through all the units in--

702
00:38:56,083 --> 00:38:57,126
Think I'm an idiot?

703
00:38:58,210 --> 00:38:59,837
- Huh?
- [sighs]

704
00:39:01,547 --> 00:39:03,007
I won't take this anymore.

705
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:07,053
You think you're better
than the people above you?

706
00:39:15,269 --> 00:39:16,687
- [door closes]
- [lock chimes]

707
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:18,105

708
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:21,233
Holy shit!

709
00:39:21,317 --> 00:39:23,486
Seriously? Are you kidding?

710
00:39:23,569 --> 00:39:25,613
Are… you… kidding me?

711
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:26,864
[frustrated grunting]

712
00:39:28,407 --> 00:39:29,867

713
00:39:31,327 --> 00:39:32,370

- [unsettling music playing]
- [grunts angrily]

716
00:39:39,585 --> 00:39:40,795
PLEASE BE QUIET!

717
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:43,381
Hey! I know you're in there. Come out!

718
00:39:44,173 --> 00:39:47,259
- I said get out here! Damn it!
- [woman] What are you doing?

719
00:39:49,261 --> 00:39:50,429
I live upstairs.

720
00:39:51,013 --> 00:39:52,556
These people are spying on me.

721
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,684
They're watching me to…
to… know when to make noises.

722
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:57,978
I heard it was you
who was making the noise.

723
00:39:58,062 --> 00:40:00,022
[scoffs] Me? You think it's me?

724
00:40:00,106 --> 00:40:02,066
- [gasps fearfully]
- Says who? People in this unit?

725
00:40:02,149 --> 00:40:04,693
Hey! Excuse me. Wait…
Excuse me. Wait a minute.

726
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:06,278
<i>It's really not me, okay?</i>

727
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:07,530
Come on!

728
00:40:07,613 --> 00:40:09,115
[uneasy music playing]

729
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:17,998
[music fades]

730
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:20,835
[man] Excuse me, you got a light?

731
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:22,253
Sure.

732
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:31,637
What are you lookin' at?

733
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:33,973
Oh, it's nothing.

734
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:38,602
Did you know there was
a murder in the complex next door?

735
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,272
Really? Why?

736
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:46,861
Noise complaint, apparently.

737
00:40:50,739 --> 00:40:53,659
[sighs] That's not
a good reason to kill someone.

738
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:58,747
[man] People complain about the noise
in our building too. It's very troubling.

739
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:01,792
It's not that bad.

740
00:41:03,335 --> 00:41:05,629
Usually, the noisy asshole is oblivious.

741
00:41:07,923 --> 00:41:08,757
Huh?

742
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:14,138
If this does end up in a murder,

743
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:17,433
the property values would tank,
wouldn't they?

744
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:20,978
What's your issue?

745
00:41:21,061 --> 00:41:22,605

746
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:28,819

You motherfucker!

766
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:50,734
You're the one!

767
00:42:50,818 --> 00:42:53,237
You fucking slashed my tires
with that knife, you asshole!

768
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:56,365
Well, I'm not gonna back down!
I'm not! I'm not! I'm not!

867
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:33,267
- [man 1] Uh-huh.
- [man 2] It has.

868
00:47:34,226 --> 00:47:37,563
You were trying to blame me
for being too noisy. It was you!

869
00:47:37,646 --> 00:47:40,607
Yeah, that's right. You were going
after me, telling me to be quiet.

870
00:47:41,108 --> 00:47:42,568
[man 1501] Everyone, listen.

871
00:47:42,651 --> 00:47:44,069
Let's not just stand around.

872
00:47:44,152 --> 00:47:46,613
We should take a look inside
since we're all here.

873
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:49,408
- Let's check it out.
- Hold on a minute. I said hold on!

874
00:47:49,491 --> 00:47:52,953
- Look, I realize how bad this looks!
- We'll just take a quick look around.

875
00:47:53,036 --> 00:47:56,582
Whoa, where d'ya think you're going?
Isn't this trespassing?

876
00:47:56,665 --> 00:47:59,293
They weren't regular noises.
It was like a subwoofer.

877
00:47:59,376 --> 00:48:02,212
- Man, what do you mean a subwoofer?
- [man 1301] Let's not do this here.

878
00:48:02,296 --> 00:48:05,465
- We should just call the police.
- [man 2] You're right. Call the police!

879
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:08,176
- Lock him up!
- [representative] Stop this at once!

880
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:09,845
- [sighs]
- [man 3] Huh?

881
00:48:09,928 --> 00:48:11,930
[representative] I can't stand this
any longer.

882
00:48:12,014 --> 00:48:14,808
Why are you so desperate
to make a big deal out of this?

883
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:17,728
Don't you know
this is a crucial time for the complex.

884
00:48:17,811 --> 00:48:20,939
I mean, of course it is,
but we can't keep living like this.

885
00:48:21,023 --> 00:48:23,650
We can't live at all
if the property value goes down.

886
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:26,194
Would you burn down a house
to catch a flea?

887
00:48:26,987 --> 00:48:28,739
[man 1601] How can catching
one noise polluter

888
00:48:28,822 --> 00:48:30,365
cause problems for the entire complex?

889
00:48:30,949 --> 00:48:32,326
Kind of sounds like a leap.

890
00:48:34,995 --> 00:48:36,204
- [scoffs]
- [keypad beeps]

891
00:48:37,998 --> 00:48:38,874
What?

892
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:41,627
Are you gonna post the video
on the Internet?

893
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:43,170
Or try to get it on the news?

894
00:48:44,338 --> 00:48:48,216
Seems like you can't wait to tell everyone
our apartments have a noise issue.

895
00:48:48,717 --> 00:48:50,260
I've been thinking about it,

896
00:48:51,178 --> 00:48:52,763
and it just makes no sense.

897
00:48:53,639 --> 00:48:55,891
If you can't deal with the noise,
you should leave.

898
00:48:56,683 --> 00:48:59,144
Why do you still want to live here?

899
00:48:59,227 --> 00:49:00,312
Do you think

900
00:49:00,395 --> 00:49:02,940
that this young man
is making noise on purpose

901
00:49:03,023 --> 00:49:04,566
to keep other tenants from moving in?

902
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:06,026
[man 1601] That must be it.

903
00:49:06,109 --> 00:49:08,820
Once the GTX comes through,
the rent is bound to go up.

904
00:49:08,904 --> 00:49:11,114
Maybe someone's spreading a rumor
there's a noise issue?

905
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:12,240
Hold on. Hold on.

906
00:49:13,033 --> 00:49:14,326
That doesn't sound right.

907
00:49:14,409 --> 00:49:15,911
What kind of logic is that?

908
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:18,288
Let me get this straight.

909
00:49:18,872 --> 00:49:21,124
You're falsely accusing us
because we're renters?

910
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:22,584
"Falsely accused," my ass.

911
00:49:24,294 --> 00:49:27,381
Hey, upstairs guy. When you came
down here, it suddenly got quiet.

912
00:49:27,464 --> 00:49:28,632
Why is that?

913
00:49:30,384 --> 00:49:33,512
It's because the people downstairs
have been spying on me with their phone.

914
00:49:33,595 --> 00:49:35,430
They wait till I'm home
to start the noise,

915
00:49:35,514 --> 00:49:37,683
and then get quiet if someone comes over.

916
00:49:37,766 --> 00:49:39,726
- To pin it all on me.
- You got evidence?

917
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:41,853
Evidence? Show us your phone.

918
00:49:42,437 --> 00:49:45,857
Everybody, I'm sure it's them.
You should check their place first.

919
00:49:45,941 --> 00:49:48,068
You'll definitely find speakers
in that apartment.

920
00:49:48,151 --> 00:49:49,277
Just a moment.

921
00:49:49,361 --> 00:49:50,696
All right, Woo-sung.

922
00:49:51,446 --> 00:49:54,783
You'll let us see your apartment
if we check downstairs first?

923
00:49:54,866 --> 00:49:55,701
Yes!

924
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:58,453
- [door closes]
- Of course. For sure.

925
00:49:59,246 --> 00:50:00,664
But it won't come to that.

926
00:50:01,164 --> 00:50:03,583
Then let's look at your place first.

927
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:06,253
Everyone's here already.
Let's check his place first.

928
00:50:06,336 --> 00:50:08,714
Why? So you can hide the evidence
while they're checking?

929
00:50:08,797 --> 00:50:10,340
No. I'm staying right here.

930
00:50:10,424 --> 00:50:13,218
- Woo-sung. You're not the culprit?
- No.

931
00:50:13,301 --> 00:50:16,179
So let them see yours first.
It'll be faster than debating it.

932
00:50:16,263 --> 00:50:18,515
- [unsettling music playing]
- [Woo-sung sighs]

933
00:50:19,725 --> 00:50:20,934
[sighs]

934
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:22,853
All right, ma'am. Okay. Sure.

935
00:50:22,936 --> 00:50:24,312
[lock whirs, chimes]

936
00:50:25,522 --> 00:50:27,315
The maintenance man will go in.

937
00:50:27,399 --> 00:50:28,275
Sure.

938
00:50:28,358 --> 00:50:29,860
[1501] We will go in with him.

939
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:34,072
All of us have the same layout anyway.
We'll be able to take a proper look.

940
00:50:34,156 --> 00:50:36,241
Right, faster with two people. Go ahead.

941
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:38,910
[sighs] Excuse you!

942
00:50:38,994 --> 00:50:42,289
By the way,
I'll be the one checking out your place.

943
00:50:42,372 --> 00:50:43,790
Do whatever you like.

944
00:50:44,291 --> 00:50:46,460
- [loud grinding]
- [man yelps]

945
00:50:46,543 --> 00:50:48,962
- Where's that coming from?
- Hear that? You hear that?!

946
00:50:49,046 --> 00:50:52,215
You still think it's me?
You still think it's me?

947
00:50:52,299 --> 00:50:54,342
All right, let's head to the unit below.

948
00:50:54,426 --> 00:50:55,594
Let's go!

949
00:50:55,677 --> 00:50:56,928
[maintenance man] I found it.

950
00:50:59,723 --> 00:51:01,391
[loud grinding, rattling]

951
00:51:01,475 --> 00:51:03,977
[woman 2] Yeah,
that's gotta be the speaker!

952
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:19,409
[loud grinding, rattling continues]

953
00:51:23,413 --> 00:51:25,248
18 HOURS OF CONSTRUCTION NOISE

954
00:51:25,332 --> 00:51:26,208
[silence]

955
00:51:26,875 --> 00:51:29,503
[1501] So it's the people downstairs, hmm?

956
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:33,256
This…

957
00:51:34,216 --> 00:51:36,259
[1501] You absolute piece of shit.

958
00:51:36,343 --> 00:51:38,345
[unsettling music sting]

959
00:51:38,428 --> 00:51:39,721
[dramatic music playing]

960
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:44,935
What did you do? What'd you do?!

961
00:51:45,018 --> 00:51:46,353
How'd you do all that?

962
00:51:48,522 --> 00:51:51,775
You should stop by the mental hospital
before the police station.

963
00:51:52,317 --> 00:51:54,528
- Son of a bitch! When did you do this?
- Hey! Whoa!

964
00:51:54,611 --> 00:51:57,322
- When did you break into my house?
- What do you think you're doing?

965
00:51:57,405 --> 00:51:59,241
When the hell
did you break into my apartment?

966
00:51:59,324 --> 00:52:01,326
Get out! Get out!

967
00:52:01,409 --> 00:52:04,246
Everyone, out! Get out!
Everyone get the hell out!

968
00:52:04,329 --> 00:52:06,790
- [residents muttering]
- [camera clicking]

969
00:52:08,667 --> 00:52:10,043
I… I didn't do it. I swear.

970
00:52:10,127 --> 00:52:12,587
This asshole must've come in
through the balcony to set this up.

971
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:13,505
It was all--

972
00:52:14,256 --> 00:52:15,215
[pained groan]

973
00:52:16,091 --> 00:52:17,134
[groans]

974
00:52:17,217 --> 00:52:19,344
[unsettling music playing]

975
00:52:29,896 --> 00:52:31,064
[music building]

976
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:33,567
- [pained yelp]
- [residents gasp]

977
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:34,609
[music stops]

978
00:52:37,279 --> 00:52:38,113
[gasps]

979
00:52:39,489 --> 00:52:40,699
[gasping]

980
00:52:44,452 --> 00:52:47,289
- [music resumes]
- Uh… uh… Hey.

981
00:52:47,372 --> 00:52:50,208
- [woman 3] He hit him, didn't he?
- I think he punched him.

982
00:52:50,292 --> 00:52:52,794
- [woman 3] He's not dead, is he?
- I didn't do anyth--

983
00:52:52,878 --> 00:52:55,797
Excuse us. Coming through.
Coming through. Excuse us.

984
00:52:55,881 --> 00:52:57,799
- [woman 3] That guy hit him!
- [gasps]

985
00:52:58,675 --> 00:53:00,594
Hands up. Back away.

986
00:53:00,677 --> 00:53:02,512
Back away now. Back away!

987
00:53:02,596 --> 00:53:04,264
[Woo-sung] Oh. But… but… I… I just--

988
00:53:04,347 --> 00:53:06,016
- On your knees.
- Don't move. Do not move.

989
00:53:06,099 --> 00:53:08,059
- Darling? Were you hit?
- [officer 1] On your knees!

990
00:53:08,143 --> 00:53:11,313
- You're under arrest.
- [woman 1301] This asshole hit my husband!

991
00:53:11,396 --> 00:53:14,191
[Woo-sung] Ugh. Oh, come on.
How many times do I have to tell you? Huh?

992
00:53:14,274 --> 00:53:15,442
I'm the one who got hit.

993
00:53:15,525 --> 00:53:17,944
The downstairs guy faked it
and hurt himself!

994
00:53:18,028 --> 00:53:21,740
All right. But you need to be patient.
The victim said he'd be here soon.

995
00:53:21,823 --> 00:53:23,366
[Chang-wu] <i>8:15. Dump!</i>

996
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:25,410
Ugh, this is ridiculous.

997
00:53:25,493 --> 00:53:26,870
I'm the victim here!

998
00:53:27,913 --> 00:53:29,581
- Oh, excuse me, sir.
- Whoa!

999
00:53:29,664 --> 00:53:33,585
Sir… sir… I really can't be here
like this right now.

1000
00:53:33,668 --> 00:53:35,587
It's a life-or-death situation.

1001
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:36,671
I gotta go home,

1002
00:53:36,755 --> 00:53:39,299
but I'll come right back
so you can handcuff me again. Please?

1003
00:53:39,382 --> 00:53:40,425
What's the issue?

1004
00:53:40,508 --> 00:53:41,801
It's, uh… It's personal.

1005
00:53:43,762 --> 00:53:45,555
- I see. Personal?
- Yes.

1006
00:53:46,431 --> 00:53:48,558
Guess you should resolve
your criminal case first.

1007
00:53:48,642 --> 00:53:52,312
Hey, hey, hey, hey, give me my phone.
I'll call my lawyer. Give me my phone!

1008
00:53:54,105 --> 00:53:56,316
[sighs] Which one of these is yours?

1009
00:53:56,399 --> 00:53:59,945
Oh, uh, uh… The, uh… The black one.
Black one. B-- Black. It's black.

1010
00:54:01,071 --> 00:54:03,740
[officer 2] By the way,
why does he have two phones?

1011
00:54:03,823 --> 00:54:07,535
[officer 1] Oh, the other one is
the one that was connected to the speaker.

1012
00:54:07,619 --> 00:54:09,663
- [officer 2] Oh, is that so?
- Shit! [groans]

1013
00:54:09,746 --> 00:54:12,540
[pained groaning]

1014
00:54:15,126 --> 00:54:16,294
Can I use the bathroom?

1015
00:54:16,378 --> 00:54:18,588
- All of a sudden?
- Then, what, should I go here?

1016
00:54:18,672 --> 00:54:20,507
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Just wait.

1017
00:54:21,716 --> 00:54:23,843
Ugh, my stomach. [groans]

1018
00:54:24,594 --> 00:54:26,012
- [dramatic music playing]
- Hey!

1019
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:27,472
Hey! Get him!

1020
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:30,141
I just need a minute!

1021
00:54:30,225 --> 00:54:32,060
- [groans]
- [officer 2] Do not resist!

1022
00:54:32,143 --> 00:54:34,854
- Stop resisting!
- Wait. Please. Just let me go.

1023
00:54:34,938 --> 00:54:37,482
- [officer 2] Don't move!
- What's going on? What's with the noise?

1024
00:54:37,565 --> 00:54:41,111
I was finally getting to my paperwork.
I'm trying to focus!

1025
00:54:41,194 --> 00:54:43,488
[officer 2] Oh, the suspect
is trying to escape.

1026
00:54:43,571 --> 00:54:46,783
- He's breaking free!
- [determined yelling]

1027
00:54:46,866 --> 00:54:48,076
[officers gasping] Whoa!

1028
00:54:48,576 --> 00:54:51,079
[officer 3] What the hell?
Who is this weirdo? [knocks door]

1029
00:54:51,162 --> 00:54:52,789
[officer 2] He suddenly tried to flee!

01:05:07,278 --> 01:05:08,195
What?

1201
01:05:08,279 --> 01:05:10,281
Are they trying to buy the whole building?

1202
01:05:11,657 --> 01:05:13,117
That pisses me off.

1203
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:15,286
They knew the GTX was coming through.

1204
01:05:15,369 --> 01:05:17,955
They're making these noises

1205
01:05:18,039 --> 01:05:19,999
so they can buy the whole place up.

1206
01:05:20,082 --> 01:05:21,500
But it doesn't make sense.

1207
01:05:21,584 --> 01:05:24,003
There's multiple units.
It's not good if there's a noise issue.

1208
01:05:24,086 --> 01:05:27,006
But remember in the hallway?
Property value is what they care about.

1209
01:05:28,382 --> 01:05:31,719
We're onto something. I think
it's the penthouse people. Don't you?

1210
01:05:31,802 --> 01:05:33,763
But if they really are the culprits,

1211
01:05:33,846 --> 01:05:36,223
then doesn't that mean
these contracts are void?

1212
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:38,726
What do you mean?

1213
01:05:38,809 --> 01:05:40,937
We find evidence they're making the noise

1214
01:05:41,020 --> 01:05:43,898
and threaten to make it public
unless they agree to cancel the contracts.

1215
01:05:43,981 --> 01:05:45,900
What the fuck else
are they gonna do, right?

1216
01:05:46,734 --> 01:05:50,029
These people… operate in the shadows.

1217
01:05:50,112 --> 01:05:52,615
Okay, okay. Oh, okay, okay. Yeah, yeah.

1218
01:05:52,698 --> 01:05:55,952
That makes sense.
So all we need to do is find the evidence?

1219
01:05:56,702 --> 01:05:59,372
Yeah. We need to find the speakers.

1220
01:06:00,206 --> 01:06:02,041
But we can't get in their apartment.

1221
01:06:03,542 --> 01:06:06,003
[intercom ringing]

1222
01:06:19,934 --> 01:06:22,269
- Good morning.
- [Ms. Jeon] <i>Hi, good morning.</i>

1223
01:06:22,353 --> 01:06:23,688
<i>I hope I didn't wake you.</i>

1224
01:06:24,188 --> 01:06:26,065
Uh, wh… wh… what can I do for you?

1225
01:06:26,148 --> 01:06:28,776
[Ms. Jeon] <i>I'd like to talk about</i>
<i>what happened yesterday.</i>

1226
01:06:28,859 --> 01:06:30,319
<i>Can you come up for a moment?</i>

1227
01:06:30,945 --> 01:06:32,113
Right this minute?

1228
01:06:32,655 --> 01:06:36,867
- [Ms. Jeon] <i>It'll only take a moment.</i>
- Yes, well, see you in a minute.

1229
01:06:44,875 --> 01:06:46,168
Could you help me out?

1230
01:06:58,222 --> 01:06:59,724
How are you feeling today?

1231
01:07:00,683 --> 01:07:01,809
Better, I guess.

1232
01:07:02,393 --> 01:07:03,686
Wh… what's this about?

1233
01:07:04,729 --> 01:07:05,813
Mm…

1234
01:07:06,856 --> 01:07:08,649
Regarding what happened yesterday.

1235
01:07:10,484 --> 01:07:13,279
You're sure your neighbor… hurt himself?

1236
01:07:13,362 --> 01:07:14,739
[Woo-sung sighs]

1237
01:07:15,531 --> 01:07:16,615
We've been over that.

1238
01:07:19,869 --> 01:07:21,704
You can be honest with me, Woo-sung.

1239
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:25,416
I'll help you out.

1240
01:07:26,459 --> 01:07:27,793
Why are you so concerned?

1241
01:07:27,877 --> 01:07:31,088
The thing is,
I want to keep this from escalating.

1242
01:07:31,839 --> 01:07:33,382
Your neighbor, however…

1243
01:07:33,883 --> 01:07:36,385
[doorbell chimes]

1244
01:07:36,469 --> 01:07:37,720
[Ms. Jeon] Oh, just a moment.

1245
01:07:42,224 --> 01:07:43,350
[intercom beeps]

1246
01:07:43,434 --> 01:07:44,518
Can I help you?

1247
01:07:44,602 --> 01:07:48,898
<i>Uh, hi, I'm… I'm the tenant in 1501.</i>

1248
01:07:48,981 --> 01:07:50,316
<i>Do you remember me?</i>

1249
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:51,400
[Ms. Jeon] I do.

1250
01:07:51,484 --> 01:07:54,320
<i>Well, the thing is, there's</i>
<i>a bit of an issue in the apartment.</i>

1251
01:07:54,403 --> 01:07:55,404
Excuse me?

1252
01:07:56,030 --> 01:07:57,615
Can I use your bathroom?

1253
01:07:58,949 --> 01:07:59,867
Over there.

1254
01:07:59,950 --> 01:08:02,286
<i>- </i>[1501] <i>It'll only take a moment.</i>
- [tense music playing]

1255
01:08:02,369 --> 01:08:04,205

- [door lock chimes]

1256
01:08:04,288 --> 01:08:05,289
[Woo-sung sighs]

01:08:08,084 --> 01:08:09,627
[dramatic music playing]

1258
01:08:34,735 --> 01:08:36,195
[suspenseful music playing]

1259

[gasps]

1260
01:08:45,454 --> 01:08:47,039
[music fades]

1261
01:08:47,957 --> 01:08:49,875
[tense music resumes]

1262
01:09:04,515 --> 01:09:06,267
[unsettling music sting]

1263
01:09:06,350 --> 01:09:07,977
[1501] You're the landlord, so--

1264
01:09:08,060 --> 01:09:10,688
- [Woo-sung] Hey, wait! [gasps]
- Get out, you bastard!

1265
01:09:10,771 --> 01:09:12,857
The bathroom.
I was looking for the bathroom!

1266
01:09:12,940 --> 01:09:14,191
What's going on?

1267
01:09:14,692 --> 01:09:17,153
This asshole was going through our room.

1268
01:09:17,236 --> 01:09:19,530
- Fucking thief.
- [grunts] I'm not a thief!

1269
01:09:19,613 --> 01:09:20,990
- Let go!
- I'm not a thief.

1270
01:09:21,073 --> 01:09:23,534
You knew the GTX would come in,
didn't you?

1271
01:09:23,617 --> 01:09:26,579
You made the noises so you could
buy my apartment for cheap!

1272
01:09:27,079 --> 01:09:31,000
What are you talking about? You think
we'd do all that for such small potatoes?

1273
01:09:31,083 --> 01:09:33,002
Potatoes? Potatoes?!

1274
01:09:33,669 --> 01:09:37,006
Then cancel the contract,
or I'm gonna take the story to the press

1275
01:09:37,089 --> 01:09:38,382
and expose it all!

1276
01:09:40,676 --> 01:09:41,552
What?!

1277
01:09:42,178 --> 01:09:44,597
I'm… I'm… [hesitating] …serious.

1278
01:09:46,557 --> 01:09:47,433
[gasps]

1279
01:09:48,851 --> 01:09:49,768
[Ms. Jeon scoffs]

1280
01:09:53,272 --> 01:09:56,525
Let's finish our conversation later.
For now, can you get rid of that thing?

1281
01:09:56,609 --> 01:09:58,527
"That thing"? "That thing"?!

1282
01:09:58,611 --> 01:10:00,571
- That's enough. Come on.
- You think I won't do it?

1283
01:10:00,654 --> 01:10:02,823
- I'm gonna fucking take you down.
- Come on. You gotta go.

1284
01:10:02,907 --> 01:10:06,827
I'll search this entire goddamn place!
I'll find the evidence! [grunts]

1285
01:10:07,745 --> 01:10:10,915
You shoulda backed off
and gone back later to take another look.

1286
01:10:10,998 --> 01:10:13,792
- You had to confront them right then?
- I'm positive.

1287
01:10:13,876 --> 01:10:15,336
The penthouse people did it.

1288
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:16,921
You saw something?

1289
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:20,299
This steel door
with a fingerprint scanner on it.

1290
01:10:20,382 --> 01:10:23,802
That's pretty weird, isn't it?
I'm sure that's where the evidence is.

1291
01:10:23,886 --> 01:10:25,804
They have a steel door
with a fingerprint scanner?

1292
01:10:25,888 --> 01:10:27,890
- Yes.
- That is suspicious.

1293
01:10:28,974 --> 01:10:32,561
- I'm getting in that fucking place again…
- I get it. Stop getting so worked up.

1294
01:10:33,270 --> 01:10:34,104
[exhales slowly]

1295
01:10:34,188 --> 01:10:36,440
Let's calm down and try
to make a plan together.

1296
01:10:37,566 --> 01:10:38,400
Together?

1297
01:10:39,693 --> 01:10:40,945
I feel bad for accusing you.

1298
01:10:42,363 --> 01:10:44,406
I really… appreciate that.

1299
01:10:44,490 --> 01:10:47,576
We wasted so much time
fighting each other, man.

1300
01:10:47,660 --> 01:10:50,537
- The whole time it was those assholes.
- Exactly.

1301
01:10:52,206 --> 01:10:53,082
Hey.

1302
01:10:53,916 --> 01:10:56,126
I'm Noh Woo-sung, by the way.

1303
01:10:57,336 --> 01:10:58,837
Ah, my name's Yeong Jin-ho.

1304
01:10:59,338 --> 01:11:01,632
Good to meet you,
You can call me Woo-sung.

1305
01:11:02,216 --> 01:11:03,884
[Jin-ho] I was gonna do that anyway.

1306
01:11:05,511 --> 01:11:08,264
Let's just clean up
and get some rest, huh?

1307
01:11:08,347 --> 01:11:10,474
Gotta be fresh to get our apartments back.

1308
01:11:10,975 --> 01:11:11,809
Yeah.

1309
01:11:19,483 --> 01:11:21,026
[distant banging]

1310
01:11:24,321 --> 01:11:25,322
[sighs]

1311
01:11:31,662 --> 01:11:32,621
FRIDAY, AUGUST 16

1312
01:11:32,705 --> 01:11:34,081
DRAW YOUR UNLOCK PATTERN

1313
01:11:37,710 --> 01:11:39,878
[ominous music playing]

1314
01:11:43,215 --> 01:11:45,009
[doorbell chimes]

1315
01:11:45,759 --> 01:11:47,928
Jin-ho, are you awake? It's me, Woo-sung.

1316
01:11:55,728 --> 01:11:57,604
Hey. Awake already?

1317
01:11:58,522 --> 01:12:00,899
The Wi-Fi at my place got disconnected.

1318
01:12:00,983 --> 01:12:02,901
Is it okay if I connect to yours?

1319
01:12:03,652 --> 01:12:05,487
Wi-Fi? I don't have it either.

1320
01:12:07,114 --> 01:12:08,365
Oh, you don't?

1321
01:12:09,033 --> 01:12:10,951
That's fine. I'll let you sleep.

1322
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:16,165
Hey, Woo-sung.

1323
01:12:16,248 --> 01:12:17,916
[tense music playing]

1324
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:18,834
Yeah?

1325
01:12:19,460 --> 01:12:21,211
I'm going down to the sauna. Wanna join?

1326
01:12:21,295 --> 01:12:23,255
Sweating it out really helps me sleep.

1327
01:12:23,881 --> 01:12:26,008
Oh, I just cleaned up
and I'm pretty tired.

1328
01:12:26,091 --> 01:12:27,968
Think I'll try to snooze.
Good luck sleeping.

1329
01:12:32,056 --> 01:12:33,349
[door lock chimes]

1330
01:12:41,148 --> 01:12:43,192
[unsettling music playing]

1331
01:13:09,009 --> 01:13:10,761
- [gasps]
- [music intensifies]

1332
01:13:21,855 --> 01:13:22,981
[receptionist] Good morning.

1333
01:13:26,944 --> 01:13:27,820
[machine beeps]

1334
01:13:29,113 --> 01:13:30,155
[Woo-sung] Jin-ho!

1335
01:13:31,407 --> 01:13:32,866
- Yo. Couldn't sleep?
- [music stops]

1336
01:13:33,617 --> 01:13:34,827
I think I'm too tense.

1337
01:13:34,910 --> 01:13:36,745
Yeah, sweating'll probably help.

1338
01:13:36,829 --> 01:13:37,871
Yeah.

1339
01:13:40,999 --> 01:13:44,211
Oh. I forgot my access is cut off
'cause I didn't pay. [chuckles]

1340
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:47,506
- Please go ahead.
- You can take it off my account, right?

1341
01:13:47,589 --> 01:13:49,425
Oh, we normally
don't allow you to do that.

1342
01:13:49,508 --> 01:13:50,634
But you can?

1343
01:13:50,717 --> 01:13:53,262
Sure. We'll let you in this time.

1344
01:13:55,514 --> 01:13:56,682
[chuckles] Thanks, man.

1345
01:14:00,227 --> 01:14:01,395
I appreciate it.

1346
01:14:05,149 --> 01:14:06,024
[chuckles]

1347
01:14:07,025 --> 01:14:07,860
Let's go.

1348
01:14:09,820 --> 01:14:10,988
[music fades]

1349
01:14:19,371 --> 01:14:21,707
What? Do I look like a thug?

1350
01:14:28,005 --> 01:14:32,301
I travel to dangerous places to shoot
videos and sell them to TV networks.

1351
01:14:32,384 --> 01:14:34,553
That's what I do. I'm a freelancer.

1352
01:14:35,220 --> 01:14:37,723
So you're, like… [clears throat]
…an undercover journalist.

1353
01:14:37,806 --> 01:14:39,099
[Jin-ho] Exactly. Undercover.

1354
01:14:39,183 --> 01:14:43,812
Got some tattoos along the way,
also got stabbed. Tortured too…

1355
01:14:43,896 --> 01:14:46,482
And for what? Put my life on the line.

1356
01:14:47,107 --> 01:14:48,609
Never got credit for it.

1357
01:14:48,692 --> 01:14:51,570
And those TV station assholes
make all the fucking money.

1358
01:14:51,653 --> 01:14:55,908
It stopped being fun. [clicks tongue]
So I think I'm gonna do it on my own.

1359
01:14:55,991 --> 01:14:58,869
Something so spicy,
it'll shake Korea to its core.

1360
01:15:00,579 --> 01:15:02,498
What about the noises in our building?

1361
01:15:02,581 --> 01:15:04,666
We've both experienced it for ourselves.

1362
01:15:05,918 --> 01:15:08,754
You must really wanna kill them, right?

1363
01:15:10,130 --> 01:15:10,964
Yes.

1364
01:15:12,257 --> 01:15:13,634
I really want to kill them.

1365
01:15:14,885 --> 01:15:15,928
Right?

1366
01:15:18,347 --> 01:15:19,598
[chuckles uneasily]

1367
01:15:21,558 --> 01:15:25,812
[groans sleepily] Probably
because I haven't slept. I'm still tired.

1368
01:15:26,438 --> 01:15:28,106

Ruined my goddamn plans.

All right, fuck it.
Let's finish it off today.

Hello, police?
I'm calling from Royal City.

1511

The guy who caused a scene yesterday.
Yes, yes, yes, Noh Woo-sung.

1512
01:25:28,581 --> 01:25:30,917
I think he, uh,
killed his downstairs neighbor.

1513
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:34,462
He went up to the penthouse.
He said he's gonna kill them too. Yes.

01:26:01,531 --> 01:26:02,407
Oh?

1522
01:26:02,949 --> 01:26:06,744
Noh Woo-sung, the apartment serial killer,
was hiding under my bed.

1523
01:26:08,079 --> 01:26:09,956
I think he's trying to kill me too.

1524
01:26:10,957 --> 01:26:12,125
What do I do?

1525
01:26:13,001 --> 01:26:15,003
- All right.
- [door closes]

1526
01:26:15,086 --> 01:26:16,296

01:26:29,559 --> 01:26:30,518
Woo-sung…

1532
01:26:31,311 --> 01:26:32,645
Why would you kill someone

1533
01:26:32,729 --> 01:26:35,064
in someone else's home?

1534
01:26:36,983 --> 01:26:39,152
- [Woo-sung gasps]
- Did you kill her with that hammer?

1535

What? Am I next?

1536
01:26:43,156 --> 01:26:45,325
Hey. Please, don't do it.

1537
01:26:48,161 --> 01:26:49,621
Fucking crazy.

1538
01:26:50,288 --> 01:26:52,498
Look at this place.
You think anyone'll believe you?

1539
01:26:53,541 --> 01:26:54,667
Probably would.

1540
01:26:55,376 --> 01:26:58,546
You're the only one with the motive
to kill the lady downstairs.

1541
01:26:59,047 --> 01:27:00,381
I made sure of that.

1542
01:27:01,549 --> 01:27:03,593
So you're gonna blame everything on me?

1543
01:27:05,929 --> 01:27:06,846
Hey.

1544
01:27:07,347 --> 01:27:09,015
You were gonna commit suicide.

1545
01:27:09,098 --> 01:27:11,893
Wouldn't you rather
make your death worthwhile?

1546
01:27:11,976 --> 01:27:15,313
Being labeled as a killer?
That's what you mean by "worthwhile"?

1547
01:27:15,396 --> 01:27:17,982
You're really a victim,
in the broader sense.

1548
01:27:18,983 --> 01:27:22,362
If they'd just built the place properly,
this wouldn't be happening.

1549
01:27:22,445 --> 01:27:24,948
This wouldn't be happening
if you weren't doing it,

1550
01:27:25,031 --> 01:27:26,157
you goddamn psycho!

1551
01:27:28,076 --> 01:27:29,244
So it's my fault?

1552
01:27:29,327 --> 01:27:31,246
[unsettling music building]

1553
01:27:34,207 --> 01:27:36,292
[pained groan]

1554
01:27:36,376 --> 01:27:37,293
[Jin-go] Hey.

1555
01:27:37,794 --> 01:27:39,128
Open your eyes.

1556
01:27:40,755 --> 01:27:43,633
Is this the dream
you've worked for your whole life?

1557
01:27:44,300 --> 01:27:46,302
[scoffs] Is this really it?

1558
01:27:47,428 --> 01:27:48,888
Aren't you even curious

1559
01:27:49,472 --> 01:27:51,557
why people pay hundreds of millions

1560
01:27:51,641 --> 01:27:53,309
for apartments
plagued with noisy neighbors,

1561
01:27:53,393 --> 01:27:55,895
resenting each other,
cursing and killing each other?

1562
01:27:55,979 --> 01:27:58,648
I mean, why?
Why won't they build them properly?

1563
01:27:58,731 --> 01:28:01,609
Who's embezzling the money,
and why are they getting away with it?

1564
01:28:01,693 --> 01:28:02,902
Who is it?

1565
01:28:04,404 --> 01:28:05,697
The truth

1566
01:28:06,948 --> 01:28:08,908
is right behind that steel door

1567
01:28:09,409 --> 01:28:11,202
on the top floor of this building.

1568
01:28:11,869 --> 01:28:15,206
Ah, shit.
Did he really hit his head that hard?

1569
01:28:20,962 --> 01:28:24,132
[Woo-sung] Then you could've just gone
to the top floor from the start.

1570
01:28:24,924 --> 01:28:25,925
Why me?

1571
01:28:26,509 --> 01:28:27,719
Why involve me?

1572
01:28:27,802 --> 01:28:30,513
I didn't do anything
to deserve any of this bullshit!

1573
01:28:30,596 --> 01:28:32,807
[Jin-ho] I went through
this entire building.

1574
01:28:32,890 --> 01:28:34,642
You seemed like the easiest target.

1575
01:28:35,268 --> 01:28:37,145
You have this really pitiful story.

1576
01:28:37,687 --> 01:28:41,316
You are the epitome of pain and suffering
of today's younger generation.

1577
01:28:42,442 --> 01:28:43,651
Don't you agree?

1578
01:28:44,235 --> 01:28:45,945
You're just the perfect messenger.

1579

"A young man driven so crazy
by his noisy neighbors

1580

Woo-sung.

1588
01:29:17,143 --> 01:29:18,144
I'll ensure

1589
01:29:18,728 --> 01:29:20,396
your death does a lot of good.

1590
01:29:21,856 --> 01:29:23,232
I'm sorry, Woo-sung.

1591
01:29:24,108 --> 01:29:25,485
Jin-ho, please.

Please

Just help me get my apartment back.
Let's do this together. Please.

You're gonna help me kill people?

1598

That lady from downstairs
threw a wrench in your plan.

[breathless gasp] So now you're forced
to wrap up everything tonight.

1600
01:29:51,969 --> 01:29:53,388
You think you can do it alone?

1601
01:29:53,471 --> 01:29:56,766
If you're on your own and fail,
no truth gets exposed.

I'm sick of this fucking shit too!

I wanna get my home back.
And my life back too.

1606
01:30:09,612 --> 01:30:14,033
We'll send a message out into the world.
What reason do I have to betray you?

1607
01:30:17,495 --> 01:30:18,871
Then who's the messenger?

Not bad.

01:30:30,508 --> 01:30:31,509
But, Woo-sung.

1614
01:30:32,301 --> 01:30:33,761
If things go sideways,

1615
01:30:35,221 --> 01:30:37,598
I'm going to pay
your mother a visit in Namhae.

1616
01:30:39,058 --> 01:30:40,435

All right, allow me to introduce myself.

Yeong Jin-ho, ma'am. Nice to meet you.

What?

1634
01:33:19,885 --> 01:33:22,388
When you were still a prosecutor,
a year or so ago,

1635
01:33:22,471 --> 01:33:25,182
you blocked a news story about
the poor construction of this complex.

1636
01:33:25,266 --> 01:33:27,518
Didn't you?
I'm the journalist who covered that story.

1637
01:33:27,602 --> 01:33:30,605
I risked my life for it.
I got stabbed by thugs.

1638
01:33:30,688 --> 01:33:32,356
Do you know how fucked up
it makes you feel

1639
01:33:32,440 --> 01:33:34,775
to have your story killed
by outside political pressure?

1640
01:33:35,359 --> 01:33:36,569
It wasn't pressure.

1641
01:33:37,570 --> 01:33:38,988
We were still investigating things…

1642
01:33:39,071 --> 01:33:41,657
I've been digging up dirt on you
ever since then.

1643
01:33:41,741 --> 01:33:44,869
And one day, you quit
being a prosecutor all of a sudden,

1644
01:33:44,952 --> 01:33:48,456
and started buying up these apartments,
even though you knew they were subpar.

1645
01:33:48,539 --> 01:33:50,166
So I thought I'd follow you in.

1646
01:33:50,249 --> 01:33:52,543
I thought I might discover
something interesting

1647
01:33:52,627 --> 01:33:54,045
if I lived close to you.

1648
01:33:54,879 --> 01:33:57,465
There must be…
some kinda misunderstanding.

1649
01:33:57,548 --> 01:33:59,216
I'm gonna ask you a question now.

1650
01:33:59,759 --> 01:34:01,177
Where'd you hide the ledger?

1651
01:34:06,432 --> 01:34:08,184
Is it behind that steel door?

1652
01:34:10,311 --> 01:34:11,354
What ledger?

1653
01:34:12,772 --> 01:34:15,524
I'll ask one more time.
Please listen carefully.

1654
01:34:15,608 --> 01:34:18,944
The ledger of the dirty money you
and your supervisor husband took.

With the names
of all the bastards in Korea

01:34:22,239 --> 01:34:23,991
who are involved in crappy construction.

1658
01:34:25,660 --> 01:34:28,454
Where is… that ledger?

1659
01:34:30,164 --> 01:34:32,124
I don't know what you're talking about.

1660
01:34:32,792 --> 01:34:33,959
[sighs]

1661
01:34:36,337 --> 01:34:37,380
Ms. Jeon,

1662
01:34:37,922 --> 01:34:40,174
I heard you and your husband
talking about it.

1663
01:34:40,257 --> 01:34:42,802
You covered the camera,
but I could still hear.

1664
01:34:43,386 --> 01:34:44,595
Through the intercom.

1665
01:34:44,679 --> 01:34:46,180
[Ms. Jeon breathing shakily]

1666
01:34:46,263 --> 01:34:48,140
You hid the ledger
so you wouldn't get blamed

1667
01:34:48,224 --> 01:34:50,017
for brokering
shoddy construction projects.

1668
01:34:50,101 --> 01:34:52,812
You said that it was
your impenetrable armor.

1669
01:34:52,895 --> 01:34:55,898
So… that impenetrable armor

1670
01:34:55,981 --> 01:34:58,150
is behind that steel door, isn't it?

1671
01:34:58,943 --> 01:35:00,903
- I told you I don't know!
- Wrong answer!

1672
01:35:00,986 --> 01:35:01,904
My husband!

1673
01:35:01,987 --> 01:35:03,447
[shuddering breaths]

1674
01:35:03,531 --> 01:35:05,324
My husband knows.

1675
01:35:05,408 --> 01:35:07,284
He's the only one who goes in there.

1676
01:35:07,368 --> 01:35:09,620
I honestly have no idea
what he keeps in there

1677
01:35:10,162 --> 01:35:11,330
or what he does in there.

1678
01:35:12,790 --> 01:35:15,459
Okay. Time to do some fact-checking.

1679
01:35:15,543 --> 01:35:16,794
Keep a close eye on her.

1680
01:35:17,837 --> 01:35:19,004
All right.

1681
01:35:19,839 --> 01:35:22,299
- Let's go. Come on.
- [unsettling music playing]

1682

You've had too much to drink. Come on.

1683
01:35:27,555 --> 01:35:28,639
All right.

[door lock beeping]

1685
01:35:31,767 --> 01:35:33,310
[Jin-ho sighs] Okay.

1686
01:35:34,228 --> 01:35:37,481
- Woo-sung. I was too harsh on you earlier.
- [Jin-ho] Oh…

1687
01:35:38,232 --> 01:35:41,110
I'm sorry. But it's obvious to me

1688
01:35:41,193 --> 01:35:44,280
that you're doing this
because you have no choice.

1689
01:35:44,363 --> 01:35:47,616
You're being pressured
into doing it, aren't you?

1690
01:35:47,700 --> 01:35:49,535
[Woo-sung] The downstairs lady died.

1691
01:35:50,327 --> 01:35:51,203
What? How?

1692
01:35:53,539 --> 01:35:56,292
I had to act like I was on his side
to save my life.

1693
01:35:57,084 --> 01:35:58,127
I'll help you.

1694

- [dramatic music playing]
- [Ms. Jeon gasps]

1695
01:36:00,921 --> 01:36:03,090
Right. I knew you would.

1696
01:36:03,591 --> 01:36:05,009
You made the right choice.

1697
01:36:05,718 --> 01:36:08,763
If you help me,
I'll sort everything out for you.

1698
01:36:08,846 --> 01:36:10,514
That gas gun in the study.

1699
01:36:10,598 --> 01:36:13,934
- That actually works, right?
- Oh, yeah. Do something with that.

1700
01:36:14,935 --> 01:36:18,814
I'm not helping you because I like you.
You still need to pay for your crimes.

1701
01:36:18,898 --> 01:36:21,942
I really didn't do anything.
I'm not that kind of person.

1702
01:36:22,026 --> 01:36:23,903
You really believe that murderer?

1703
01:36:25,321 --> 01:36:26,989
Please, save me.

1704
01:36:27,615 --> 01:36:30,242
Help me.
I'll get your apartment back for you.

1705
01:36:30,326 --> 01:36:32,161
- [Jin-ho] What the fuck?!
- [gasps]

1706
01:36:33,829 --> 01:36:35,831
[Jin-ho] You fucking assholes.
What is that?

1707
01:36:35,915 --> 01:36:37,541
What the fuck is that? Come here.

- [Jin-ho] Where is it?!

1712
01:36:46,592 --> 01:36:49,386
- [loud clattering]
- [Jin-ho] Tell me, you fucking bitch!

1713
01:36:50,221 --> 01:36:51,514
Is this everything?

1714
01:36:53,057 --> 01:36:56,018
Is this all there is in the fucking safe?
Where is it?

1715
01:36:56,101 --> 01:36:57,394
Where?

1716
01:36:57,478 --> 01:36:59,814
[Ms. Jeon] I'm sorry.
I embezzled from maintenance funds,

1717
01:36:59,897 --> 01:37:02,191
and I took bribes
from construction companies.

1718
01:37:02,274 --> 01:37:05,444
That was wrong. But this isn't right.
Please let me live. I'll pay back--

1719
01:37:05,528 --> 01:37:09,031
[Jin-ho] Fucking bitch! Don't try
and trick me, you fucking asshole!

1720
01:37:09,114 --> 01:37:11,492
This makes no sense! Fuckers!

1721
01:37:11,575 --> 01:37:14,703
Get the fuck up, you son of a bitch.
Tell me, motherfucker.

1722
01:37:14,787 --> 01:37:17,665
- [Ms. Jeon wails]
- [Jin-ho] Where is it? Where's the ledger?

1723
01:37:17,748 --> 01:37:21,836
Where is the ledger? Fucking tell me!
This makes no fucking sense!

1724
01:37:21,919 --> 01:37:22,878
[Ms. Jeon crying]

1725
01:37:22,962 --> 01:37:27,091
[Jin-ho] I'll just kill you all, then.
Where's the fucking ledger?

1726
01:37:27,174 --> 01:37:28,884
Where is it? Where is it?!

1727
01:37:29,885 --> 01:37:31,720
- That's all I need.
- [Ju-ho groaning]

1728
01:37:31,804 --> 01:37:33,973
That's all! Tell me where it is!

1729
01:37:34,056 --> 01:37:35,266
[wailing]

1730
01:37:35,349 --> 01:37:37,643
Tell me. It holds the truth.

1731
01:37:38,269 --> 01:37:39,395
Doesn't it?

1732
01:37:41,313 --> 01:37:42,481
[music building]

1733
01:37:42,565 --> 01:37:43,983

- [Ms. Jeon gasps, whimpers]
- [grunts]

1736
01:37:57,079 --> 01:37:58,706
You pathetic little shit.

1737
01:38:00,249 --> 01:38:01,750
How dare you take their side?

1738
01:38:02,668 --> 01:38:03,502
Huh?

1739
01:38:04,003 --> 01:38:07,089
You fucking no good,
piece of shit motherfucker!

1740
01:38:07,172 --> 01:38:11,176
You fucking asshole! You fucking traitor.

1741
01:38:11,260 --> 01:38:13,304
Just die, you asshole!

1742
01:38:13,387 --> 01:38:15,139
[Ms. Jeon] You fucking bastards!

1743
01:38:22,062 --> 01:38:24,106
[Jin-ho yelling painfully]

1744
01:38:24,189 --> 01:38:25,900
[gasping]

1745
01:38:25,983 --> 01:38:28,861
- [gas hissing]
- [Jin-ho] Oh, that burns! [groans]

1746
01:38:28,944 --> 01:38:30,988

[Woo-sung coughing]

1749
01:38:34,867 --> 01:38:37,411
Go get him! Catch him and kill him.

1750
01:38:37,494 --> 01:38:39,580
Okay. You son of a bitch!

1751
01:38:40,289 --> 01:38:41,540
You're fucking dead.

1752
01:38:41,624 --> 01:38:43,959
[Ms. Jeon] We can't let him live! Get him!

1753
01:38:44,043 --> 01:38:45,628
[Ju-ho] Come here, you bastard!

1754
01:38:46,378 --> 01:38:48,380
[Woo-sung] Ma'am! Ma'am!

1755
01:38:49,256 --> 01:38:51,008
[coughing] Ma'am!

1756
01:38:51,091 --> 01:38:53,469
Ma'am! Please, open the door.

1757
01:38:53,552 --> 01:38:55,262

01:39:28,837 --> 01:39:30,297
[breathing shakily]

01:39:46,313 --> 01:39:48,315
[Jin-ho sighing]

1772
01:39:51,986 --> 01:39:53,320
[groans loudly]

1773
01:39:54,697 --> 01:39:55,948
[sighs wearily]

1774
01:39:57,825 --> 01:39:58,826
Huh?

1775
01:40:00,577 --> 01:40:01,829
[exhales slowly]

1776
01:40:05,916 --> 01:40:07,251
What is this?

1777
01:40:09,712 --> 01:40:10,838
[groans painfully]

1778
01:40:13,340 --> 01:40:15,509
[groaning, gasping]

1779
01:40:15,592 --> 01:40:18,053
- [tense music playing]
- [Jin-ho spluttering]

1780
01:40:18,137 --> 01:40:20,514
[groans, coughs]

1781
01:40:21,640 --> 01:40:22,725
[groans painfully]

1782
01:40:24,518 --> 01:40:25,436
[groans]

1783
01:40:25,519 --> 01:40:26,562
[Ms. Jeon] Kill him.

1784
01:40:30,065 --> 01:40:31,108
Do it now.

1785
01:40:32,151 --> 01:40:33,193
[Jin-ho coughs]

1786
01:40:35,446 --> 01:40:38,615
Let's just stop
and hand him over to the police.

1787
01:40:39,992 --> 01:40:41,702
[Ms. Jeon] Two people have died.

1788
01:40:42,578 --> 01:40:44,413
Who'll be responsible for that?

1789
01:40:47,416 --> 01:40:48,959
If you just let him go,

1790
01:40:50,335 --> 01:40:53,047
you'll be the one
taking the blame for it all.

1791
01:40:57,593 --> 01:40:58,635
[Jin-ho] Hey.

1792
01:41:01,346 --> 01:41:02,598
Don't worry about it.

1793
01:41:03,223 --> 01:41:04,808
That'll never happen.

1794
01:41:04,892 --> 01:41:06,518
I'll take care of everything.

1795
01:41:07,311 --> 01:41:08,395
Trust me.

1796
01:41:09,229 --> 01:41:10,647
Just kill him.

1797
01:41:10,731 --> 01:41:13,192
[Jin-ho] Come on. Wake up.

1798
01:41:13,692 --> 01:41:15,277
You can't trust her.

1799
01:41:15,360 --> 01:41:16,779
Kill him.

1800
01:41:16,862 --> 01:41:18,113
[music building]

1801
01:41:18,197 --> 01:41:19,656
Woo-sung.

1802
01:41:19,740 --> 01:41:20,908
Do it now!

1803
01:41:23,911 --> 01:41:25,079
[music fades]

1804
01:41:26,121 --> 01:41:27,372
[spluttering]

01:41:42,179 --> 01:41:43,097
[relieved sigh]

1806
01:41:44,848 --> 01:41:46,350
- [Ms. Jeon grunts]
- [groans]

1807
01:41:47,184 --> 01:41:50,104
You missed your chance, you idiot!

1808
01:41:50,187 --> 01:41:52,106
You son of a bitch!

1809
01:41:53,065 --> 01:41:55,609
[grunting]

1810
01:41:55,692 --> 01:41:58,487
- You indecisive piece of shit!
- [groans]

1811
01:41:58,570 --> 01:42:00,322
[Ms. Jeon breathing heavily]

1812
01:42:03,617 --> 01:42:04,618
[sighs]

1813
01:42:04,701 --> 01:42:06,078
[grunts, breathes wheezily]

1814
01:42:06,578 --> 01:42:08,789
This is why people live
in the countryside.

1815
01:42:09,456 --> 01:42:11,083
What a goddamn mess.

1816
01:42:12,334 --> 01:42:14,211
Who's gonna clean this shit up?

1817
01:42:16,171 --> 01:42:18,507
[golf club scraping floor]

1818
01:42:20,843 --> 01:42:21,969
[Ms. Jeon] I told you.

1819
01:42:23,178 --> 01:42:25,389
We need to be pickier with our tenants.

1820
01:42:28,475 --> 01:42:29,768
You're the one?

1821
01:42:30,310 --> 01:42:32,146
I heard there was a psycho.

1822
01:42:33,814 --> 01:42:36,275
Is this what you crawled in here for?

1823
01:42:42,030 --> 01:42:43,824
How did I forget this?

1824
01:42:45,325 --> 01:42:47,744
[scoffs, sighs]

1825
01:42:49,288 --> 01:42:52,541
I wonder why you idiots didn't hear
the part about hiding it here.

1826
01:42:53,500 --> 01:42:55,210
[chuckling]

1827
01:42:57,921 --> 01:42:58,964
You want it?

1828
01:42:59,548 --> 01:43:01,008
What was your plan?

1829
01:43:01,091 --> 01:43:04,595
To release this, and make me the villain
behind the noise problem?

1830
01:43:04,678 --> 01:43:07,848
Or maybe you thought
your story would change the world?

1831
01:43:07,931 --> 01:43:08,891
[mocking laughter]

1832
01:43:09,558 --> 01:43:11,977
[pained grunting]

1833
01:43:12,060 --> 01:43:13,061
[Ms. Jeon] So, what?

1834
01:43:14,313 --> 01:43:16,982
Would improving construction
and fortifying apartments

1835
01:43:17,065 --> 01:43:18,525
solve the noise problem?

1836
01:43:19,193 --> 01:43:20,444
It won't.

1837
01:43:21,528 --> 01:43:22,905
Like I told you,

1838
01:43:23,405 --> 01:43:25,657
excessive noise is a human problem.

1839
01:43:25,741 --> 01:43:27,409
Why blame the building?

1840
01:43:29,995 --> 01:43:33,248
If they spend more money
on construction and reinforcement,

1841
01:43:33,832 --> 01:43:35,292
it'll get more expensive.

1842
01:43:35,834 --> 01:43:40,130
That just makes it even more impossible
for people like you to buy them.

1843
01:43:40,714 --> 01:43:42,758
Does this make sense, Woo-sung?

1844
01:43:44,676 --> 01:43:45,886
You know, in life…

1845
01:43:48,138 --> 01:43:50,057
hope is not a reliable strategy.

1846
01:43:51,266 --> 01:43:53,268
You need to be more realistic.

1847
01:43:55,270 --> 01:43:57,648
But you managed to waste this life, so…

1848
01:43:59,233 --> 01:44:00,984
I hope the next one works out.

1849
01:44:01,985 --> 01:44:03,654
[tense music building]

1850
01:44:04,363 --> 01:44:06,031

- [strangled yelping]

1854
01:44:23,048 --> 01:44:24,925
- Yes!
- [strangled yelling]

1857
01:44:43,652 --> 01:44:45,195
[groaning] Ah, fuck me.

1858
01:44:45,904 --> 01:44:47,197
Held my breath so long.

1859
01:44:48,657 --> 01:44:49,658
Hey, asshole.

1860
01:44:51,743 --> 01:44:52,828
I told you.

1861
01:44:53,370 --> 01:44:54,454
The ledger.

1862
01:44:55,038 --> 01:44:56,581
The ledger is right here.

1863
01:44:56,665 --> 01:44:57,624

01:44:58,125 --> 01:44:59,334
[grunting painfully]

1865
01:44:59,418 --> 01:45:00,335
Hey.

1866
01:45:01,253 --> 01:45:02,087
Get the ledger.

1867
01:45:03,171 --> 01:45:06,133
Get your shit together
and bring me the ledger.

1868
01:45:07,467 --> 01:45:08,802
[Woo-sung groans]

1869
01:45:08,885 --> 01:45:09,886
[Jin-ho] That's it.

1870
01:45:13,265 --> 01:45:14,558
That's it.

1873
01:45:28,322 --> 01:45:29,865
[Jin-ho] Oh, for fuck's sake.

1874
01:45:30,615 --> 01:45:32,701
You don't even know
what you're looking at.

1875
01:45:33,285 --> 01:45:34,119
Bring it.

1876
01:45:36,371 --> 01:45:38,290
PROPERTY (APARTMENT) LEASE CONTRACT

1877
01:45:51,511 --> 01:45:52,429

[Jin-ho groans wearily]

1879
01:45:57,768 --> 01:45:59,770
What? Huh?

1880
01:46:01,521 --> 01:46:02,856
PROPERTY PURCHASE CONTRACT

1881
01:46:04,107 --> 01:46:05,025
NOH WOO-SUNG

1882
01:46:05,817 --> 01:46:07,569
[Jin-ho] Oh, you little shit.

1883
01:46:07,652 --> 01:46:09,821
You got your home back. All right.

1884
01:46:10,322 --> 01:46:12,115
Fucking good for you.

1885
01:46:15,035 --> 01:46:16,244
Leave the ledger,

1886
01:46:17,287 --> 01:46:19,664
but burn the contracts
and everything else.

1887
01:46:19,748 --> 01:46:21,833
Burn it all here. Damn it.

1888
01:46:25,379 --> 01:46:27,923
That's it. Bring it. Bring it here.

1889
01:46:28,840 --> 01:46:30,467
[groaning, yells painfully]

1890
01:46:31,134 --> 01:46:33,303
[pained groaning, grunting]

1891
01:46:33,387 --> 01:46:35,847
[gasping, spluttering]

1892
01:46:36,431 --> 01:46:39,518
- Gimme… gimme the ledger, you fuckhead.
- [gas hissing]

1893
01:46:40,060 --> 01:46:41,478
[Jin-ho] What are you doing?

1894
01:46:42,229 --> 01:46:45,023
[strained grunting]

1895
01:46:45,107 --> 01:46:46,733
No, no, no, no.

1896
01:46:46,817 --> 01:46:48,151
List… listen to me.

1897
01:46:50,862 --> 01:46:52,531
What are you doing?

1898
01:46:55,575 --> 01:46:56,785
Enough.

1899
01:46:58,245 --> 01:46:59,287
[music fades]

1900
01:47:01,581 --> 01:47:02,999
That's enough.

1901
01:47:03,083 --> 01:47:05,252
Stop telling me what to do.

1902
01:47:07,879 --> 01:47:10,215
You motherfuckers.

1903
01:47:11,466 --> 01:47:12,467
[gasps]

1904
01:47:13,343 --> 01:47:15,387
[unsettling music playing]

1905
01:47:27,816 --> 01:47:29,192
[inaudible]

1906
01:47:49,588 --> 01:47:51,006
[music intensifies]

1907
01:47:59,264 --> 01:48:00,599

1910
01:48:41,556 --> 01:48:43,058
[music stops]

1911
01:49:11,086 --> 01:49:11,920
[man] Mm.

1912
01:49:12,003 --> 01:49:12,837
CASE REPORT

1913
01:49:17,509 --> 01:49:18,635
Mm!

1914
01:49:22,597 --> 01:49:24,057
Uh-huh.

1915
01:49:25,809 --> 01:49:28,103
So you just think I'm a moron?

1916
01:49:29,604 --> 01:49:31,982
And I'm supposed to just let this go, huh?

1917
01:49:32,065 --> 01:49:33,483
PROSECUTION SERVICE

1918
01:49:33,567 --> 01:49:34,901
Do I look like an idiot?

1919
01:49:41,658 --> 01:49:45,787
Yeong Jin-ho's videos mention
something about Jeon Eun-hwa's ledgers.

1920
01:49:46,830 --> 01:49:49,124
But I can't confirm it
because everything burned.

1921
01:49:49,207 --> 01:49:50,625
Did you see anything?

1922
01:49:51,585 --> 01:49:52,711
Oh, nothing?

1923
01:49:53,795 --> 01:49:55,130
I see. Sure.

1924
01:49:57,090 --> 01:49:57,966
Hmm.

1925
01:49:58,883 --> 01:50:01,761
So whatever Yeong Jin-ho was looking for…

1926
01:50:05,890 --> 01:50:06,975
has disappeared.

1927
01:50:08,310 --> 01:50:09,227
Right?

1928
01:50:12,564 --> 01:50:14,024
[pensive music playing]

1929
01:51:28,473 --> 01:51:29,849

[sizzling]

1931
01:51:33,436 --> 01:51:36,731
[mother] Don't worry about anything.
Just rest here a while.

1932
01:51:36,815 --> 01:51:39,943
You can stay with me,
and live here as long as you want.

1933
01:51:41,152 --> 01:51:44,864
Don't even think about Seoul
for a while. Okay?

1934
01:51:53,289 --> 01:51:54,582
[whooshing]

1935
01:52:01,965 --> 01:52:03,967

1941
01:52:59,856 --> 01:53:01,191
