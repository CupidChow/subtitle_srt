1
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:34,350


2
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:51,790
Wh-Wh-Who are you?

3
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:59,570
Wh-What are you doing...?

4
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,680
What are you doing right now?

5
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:29,550
Wh-Where are you going? Wh-Why are you like this?

6
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,580
Hey there! Unni!

7
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,950
Hey there, are you alright?

8
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:50,730
I'm asking if you are okay. Don't you even know wh-who I am?

9
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:05,450
 Episode 12
Her Bucket List 

10
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,610
When did you get here? Have you returned to school?

11
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:52,980
No, I'm just stopping in for a minute.

12
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:58,370
Do you remember seeing me yesterday?

13
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:03,640
In front of the fridge in the lounge.

14
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:11,150
Ah, yesterday? You were surprised, weren't you? I developed a habit of binge eating while I'm sleeping.

15
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:22,190
Are you unwell somewhere?

16
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:24,280
Where?

17
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:30,270
There has just been a stir in the dorm, floating rumors of ghosts appearing, according to the kids.

18
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:32,940
What does that have to do with me?

19
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:36,900
You're really too nosy when you have enough problems of your own.

20
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:39,470
It was nice to see you.

21
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:17,420
 Side effects of sleeping pills 

22
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:26,720
 Sleeping medicine usually starts out with side effects such as drowsiness and dizziness, 

23
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:31,810
 but later it can cause symptoms of delusions, memory defects, or even sleep walking. 

24
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:34,050
 Quit taking the medicine first. 

25
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:38,570
 It would be best to visit the hospital as soon as possible and have some tests taken. 

26
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,810
- Oh, Bok Joo!
 - Oh, Mercenary!

27
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:57,190
It's so good to see you. What happened? Did you make a comeback?

28
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:59,030
Good thinking.

29
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:01,350
Since there was no Mercenary who's supposed to firmly stand in the middle of you,

30
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:04,950
the rest of you looked groggy, so I felt so bad.

31
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:06,390
You're going overboard so early in the morning.

32
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:07,860
Are you leaving now?

33
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,500
Yes.

34
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,820
Excuse me.

35
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:21,580
What? What?

36
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:25,100
She wants you to leave, you bastard. Why can't you take a hint?

37
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:29,270
Ah. Ah, it's that kind of atmosphere.

38
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:32,910
It's not like you two are dating, so what is there to talk about in secret? You should not fight each other, seriously.

39
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:36,610
Well then, you two go ahead and have your little talk. Hurry up and come out.

40
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:39,820
What? Do you have something to tell me?

41
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:44,860
Hey, have you seen Unni Song Si Ho recently?

42
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:47,690
Song Si Ho? Why?

43
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:50,860
It's just that her condition did not look good.

44
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:53,570
Honestly, last night...

45
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:57,700
 You're really too nosy when you have enough problems of your own. 

46
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:02,010
Hey, Kim Bok Joo.

47
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:05,050
Oh. It's nothing. I'm just being nosy for no reason.

48
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:07,250
Forget it. I'm going.

49
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:09,430
Why, why? What is it now? What?

50
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:11,580
Did you lose something?

51
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:14,230
No. I didn't lose anything except for my mind.

52
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:20,880
Wow, look at that! Look at it! Over there! Wow, look at it!

53
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,090
What's up with you? You must have gone insane.

54
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:26,260
You said that you don't work your part time job today, didn't you? What are you going to do?

55
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,690
No, I don't. Why?

56
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:31,740
What do you mean, why? I'm trying to schedule something with you. You agreed to try me out.

57
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:37,300
Hey, are you going to keep spouting nonsense?! Try you out, my foot!

58
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:40,720
You agreed to cooperate with me on this for a month. It will create problems if you keep acting this way, Customer.

59
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:45,060
Wh-What do you mean "c-customer"? Crazy guy.

60
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:46,610
You know we have special days off starting today, right?

61
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:51,040
I'm free after I finish the morning training today, so just think about what we're going to do afterward. I'll call you.

62
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:55,070
Okay? I'll call you.

63
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:56,480
I'm going.

64
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:59,700
Ah, that guy! Ah, he surprised me! Seriously...

65
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:03,280
That shocked me. He surprised me.

66
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,960
That slimy-looking bastard, seriously.

67
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,060
Alright, you know that you've got special days off from today until the weekend, right?

68
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:12,430
Yes!

69
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:14,220
Alright! As you know,

70
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:20,020
there's something important that our team has to worry about more when they go home to rest. What is that thing, Team Captain?

71
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:21,490
Yes, sir. It's eating well.

72
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:23,570
That's right! Huh?

73
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:28,380
You're going to go home, enjoy spending time with your family for the first time in a long while, and eat to your heart's content.

74
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:30,750
Even if you had to reduce your weight because of your weight class, you still have to eat a lot during this period.

75
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:35,460
Why? Because you have to build muscle mass when you come back.

76
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:40,420
This is not a request, it is an order.

77
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:41,550
EAT!!

78
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:46,210
Starve yourselves, no matter what. You're dead if you gain any weight, girls!

79
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:47,370
Just because you're resting for three days,

80
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:51,550
if you think that you can eat all you want for a day and a half and then just not eat for the rest of days,  then you're wrong.

81
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:55,470
Even if you guys lie, you know  the scale doesn't right?

82
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:56,660
Yes.

83
00:07:56,660 --> 00:08:02,070
You should know that I'll check your performance for the championship competition on the day you return.

84
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:08,760
These special nights out have been given to you before the rigorous winter training starts, so get plenty of rest.

85
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,600
Please don't cause any accidents. Got it?

86
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,110
YES, SIR!

87
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:14,760
- That's it.
 - Thank you!

88
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,690
Hey, what do you want to do?

89
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:20,800
Hey, I'm going to head out first since I've already got plans. Sorry.

90
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,290
Hey, hey. Where are you going?

91
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:23,590
- Let go 
 - Where are you going?

92
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:25,300
- Let me go. 
 - Hey, hey. Where are you going?

93
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:28,040
Hey! Hey! Don't go.

94
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,030
Jeong Joon Hyeong! You jerk!

95
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:34,670
Seventeen, 18, 19, 20.

96
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:36,780
I've collected 200,000 won quickly.

97
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:40,370
As expected, It's true there's a payoff for physical labor.

98
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:43,600
Oh, the smell of manual labor!

99
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,840
Alright, then. First,

100
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:49,440
let's set aside the money to buy Dad a gift.

101
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,240
This is the fee for the piano lessons.

102
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,740
 Come to Bok Chicken in thirty minutes. 

103
00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:00,850
Why does he keep telling me to try him out so suddenly? So annoying.

104
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,960
  Bok Joo 

105
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,200
Oh, Father.

106
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,010
Have you seen your uncle? He was in the store just a little while ago.

107
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:26,330
No, I haven't seen him.

108
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:29,360
Ah, that rascal. He's acting really suspicious these days.

109
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,930
Like last time, is it that he might hanging around the horse racing park or someplace?

110
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:37,200
That can't be. He even swore not to do it again, in writing, after he was severely scolded by you last time.

111
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,360
Right? That won't be it, right?

112
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:46,880
Dad, are you feeling sick? Why are you sweating so much?

113
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:51,800
It's nothing. To remove the frost in the fridge, I did some work. That's why.

114
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,900
You went to the hospital yesterday, right?

115
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:57,640
They said that the effects of dialysis diminish when you go for a long time. Isn't that what's happening?

116
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,560
The color of your face doesn't look good either, Dad.

117
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:02,790
I'm alright. I know my body better than anyone else.

118
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:06,770
You, stop worrying about it and give your uncle a call.

119
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:17,250
Uncle, where did he go?

120
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,860
 Niece Kim Bok Joo 

121
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,610
Excuse me.

122
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:26,420
Welcome.

123
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:30,210
Welcome, Mother.

124
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:37,200
Aigoo. I almost called you Mother because you have gray hair, but you're just a Noonim. You should dye your hair. I'm the one getting upset.

125
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,490
Then should I dye my hair?

126
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:39,500
Yes.

127
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:44,920
Boss, here is an order for a special hair treatment and dye #8 for the gray hair.

128
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:53,440
And here I thought that you've never dated since you were always doing sports. You sure have such a talent!

129
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,500
I said it's not like that.

130
00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:01,870
Aigoo, really.  You'll get eczema. I told you to ask me to do these things!

131
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:04,620
Well, getting up. Here, here.

132
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:09,620
Here. Please move over here. Over here.

133
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,170
Hi, Customer!

134
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:25,450
Hey, why are we meeting in front of my home?

135
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:28,800
Why? It's a given to meet your girlfriend in front of her house.

136
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,380
What are you saying?

137
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:34,700
Why? Does it bother you that we may be caught by your father and uncle?

138
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:38,990
Whatever, they already know that you are my friend. Why would I be worrie—

139
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:43,150
Why are you being like this?

140
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:50,730
Ah, it's been a while since I've been this free. It's nice. I've got you by my side too, Kim Bok Joo.

141
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:56,790
Hey, what are you going to do?  I made myself free the rest of today. You have to take responsibility for that.

142
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:59,610
What do you mean, responsibility?

143
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:03,510
 Bok Joo's Bucket List
3. Go to the amusement park on a weekday and ride the Big 5 without waiting in line. 

144
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:08,450
Hey how about an amusement park? It's been like a million years since I've been to one.

145
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:10,270
Amusement park?

146
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:14,510
Am I a little kid or something? Amusement park, my foot. How childish.

147
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:22,560
Ah, why? Let's go. It's a weekday, so there won't be many people there.

148
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:27,590
Wow, look at this! It's as if it was all planned! There's even a bus that goes directly there.

149
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:30,940
Hey, doesn't this mean that there's no reason for you not to go?

150
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:36,180
Well, that's true. Then, should we go?

151
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:39,320
Okay! Then we've decided on the amusement park!

152
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,730
Ah, I agreed to meet up with the kids later.

153
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:43,730
Who do you mean when you say the kids? The Uglies?

154
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:48,600
Yeah. They want me to meet with them and hang out before I go home. Ah, I forgot about it before I came here.

155
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:53,340
You probably spent the whole night chatting yesterday anyway. Why do you need to meet them again and hang out? Can't you just cancel the plans?

156
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:54,450
No, I can't. They'll throw a fit.

157
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:58,940
Ah, why? Come to the amusement park with me! Come to the amusement park.

158
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:10,710
Ah, I'm so excited right now! It's been forever since I've been to the amusement park!

159
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:12,430
 Hey, I think this is my first time coming on a weekday. 

160
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:16,050
Coming on weekdays is the best way for an amusement park. So we can ride as much as we want.

161
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:16,890
Of course, of course!

162
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:20,160
Hey. Go in first and then do your talking. You'll spend the whole day here.

163
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,200
Wait, wait, wait. Please wait a moment.

164
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,380
- Why? Is someone else coming?
 - Um...

165
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:30,430
Joon Hyeong! Mercenary!

166
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:34,940
I called him. If we all go together, it will be fun.

167
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:39,340
You, really. You're killer at making a team work.

168
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:43,480
Ah, I was almost home when I got the call. I ran here so fast!

169
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:47,960
You traitor! You should have called me earlier if you were going to come to a place like this!

170
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,890
You haven't gone back home yet?

171
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:52,440
No. I'm planning on taking the last train after I hang out here.

172
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:56,530
Ah! No one else is coming right?  Let's hurry and go in.

173
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:58,360
Let's go together, Joon Hyeong.

174
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,880
Hey, let's go too! Wait for us!

175
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,890
Let's go together!

176
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:08,780
Wow, I really loved this when I was younger!

177
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:11,290
Wow! Hair band! Hair band!

178
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:14,320
Wow!

179
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,410
Wow!

180
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:17,690
Hey! Let's each get one.

181
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,560
- Let's see. 
- What about this?

182
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,830
Hey how does it look?

183
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:22,110
Hey, are you a kid? You're acting so childish.

184
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:26,530
Why? You always wear one of these when you come to the amusement park.

185
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:28,550
How is this one, a demon.

186
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:32,320
I don't want to. I really hate things like this!

187
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,230
This is cute, angel and demon. Be a couple with me.

188
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:36,620
It looks good. It's cute.

189
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:38,630
Honey!

190
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:40,460
- Ahh— 
 - Give it to me!

191
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:41,500
Hey, you said you weren't going to do it!

192
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,590
- Why are you taking mine?  It's mine!
 - You said you weren't—

193
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:48,700
I told you, it's mine! This is really mine! It looks the best on me! So it's mine! It's mine; I'm telling you! It's mine. It's mine!

194
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:51,670
I'm going to wear this one! It's mine.

195
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:53,200
You wear it then! Just wear it.

196
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:56,360
Tae Gwon that fits well with a devilish-looking guy.

197
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,330
Try that one on then. It's cute.

198
00:14:58,330 --> 00:14:59,050
Am I cute?

199
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:00,720
Yes. It's better to get taken away.

200
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,220
What about me? Don't I look cool?

201
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:04,660
- How do I look?
 - Cute.

202
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:06,490
It looks good on you.

203
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:09,690
Cute, right?

204
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:12,680
♬  I feel like (I'm) dreaming of your love  ♬

205
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:16,260
♬  What exactly are you doing to me?  ♬

206
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:19,840
♬  Everything seems to be a dream  ♬

207
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:23,390
♬  All day long in thoughts of you  ♬

208
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:27,030
♬  I don't know what to do about my heart  ♬

209
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:32,250
♬  Look at it. It's pounding again  ♬

210
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:41,530

211
00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:43,700

212
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:47,410
Hey, what do you want to ride next? I want to ride that Mad Swing next.

213
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:57,770
I don't like it much. I like to ride the merry-go-round that is good for taking the selfies.

214
00:15:57,770 --> 00:16:00,440
Then, I'm for riding the merry-go-round. To take the selfies, I should ride it.

215
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:04,420
Call! For merry-go-round. If I don't ride it, when can I ride it again?

216
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:08,070
You're not the elementary students, so why do you want to ride merry-go-round? We should ride the Mad Swing.

217
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:09,750
Then I also vote for Mad Swing.

218
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:11,300
You're scared of heights. Why would you—

219
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:16,120
When was I ever scared of heights? I came here to ride the Mad Swing. It's totally my style.

220
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:22,330
I really like the Mad Swing. I love it, and I can't ride it any other day but today. I have to ride it now. Right away.

221
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:28,190
Then, the three of you and the two of us separate from here and ride whatever. Meet here again 30 minutes later. Go now.

222
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:29,880
Hey, Jeong Joon Hyeong!

223
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:33,340
- Let's go ride that. 
- We'll take some great selfies!

224
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:44,120
Are you okay? Aren't you just riding it for no reason even though you really can't ride it?

225
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,120
No, I like this.

226
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,680
Your face look really white.

227
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,270
No, my face is always white.

228
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:52,460
Then, that's a relief.

229
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:54,360
Ah, wait a second.

230
00:16:57,890 --> 00:16:59,720
Oh, yeah!

231
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:04,230
I've checked the safety device.

232
00:17:07,090 --> 00:17:08,750
I like stuff like this.

233
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:13,290
Oh, this is the most thrilling part for me! Oh, my god!

234
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:22,520
I love this. Really love it.

235
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:32,810
Bok Joo! Bok Joo!

236
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,650
BOK JOO!

237
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:46,630
STOP!!!

238
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:54,260
Jeong Joon Yeong, are you okay?

239
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:04,610
Ah, Kim Bok Joo has amazing stamina. My insides are roiling.

240
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:09,140
What should I let her eat? Hotdog.

241
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:15,590
Churros, cola—

242
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:20,830
 Bok Joo's Bucket List
 4. Get a boyfriend and drink out of one drink with two straws. 

243
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:27,640
Okay, good timing. Excuse me, give me two churros and one cola and be sure to put two straws in it, please

244
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,700
Oh churros!  Why is there only one cola?

245
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:38,280
I'm going to have some of yours.

246
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:54,910
Why?

247
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:57,610
Did your heart flutter?

248
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:03,330
This isn't your usual facial expression.

249
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:07,330
What do you mean, my heart fluttered? You crazy bastard.

250
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:12,980
Hey! It's because you surprised me when you suddenly moved so close to me! I'm not going to drink it. You drink it all!

251
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:16,870
Okay, okay. You have all of it. I won't have any more.

252
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:26,160
Oh, Nan Hee.

253
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:31,310
 Where are you guys? Hurry to the plaza, right now. They said they're going to do a fireworks show. 

254
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:35,050
Alright.  Hey! Fireworks!

255
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:48,970
 Quit taking the medicine first. 

256
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:52,840
 It seems like you should visit the hospital when you have a chance. 

257
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:10,590
Ah, it has already started.

258
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:14,110
Wow! it's so pretty.

259
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:22,170
It's so pretty!

260
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:34,290
♬  I've been hesitating for a long time  ♬

261
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:40,910
It's cold. Use what you need to.

262
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:51,870
Why? Did your heart flutter?

263
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:56,230
Yes. Your heart fluttered. Yes, it did. At this rate, do we need to do cardiopulmonary resuscitation?

264
00:20:56,230 --> 00:21:00,150
It's nice to try me out for free, but the customer's safety is also important.

265
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:02,540
I'm worried about your heart.

266
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:09,100
You crazy bastard! Why do you keep asking if my heart's fluttering all day? It's so greasy!

267
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:11,810
Ah, move! You're so annoying that I can't walk around with you!

268
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:18,720
Where did the others go?

269
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:23,080
Did I come onto her too strongly? She's already feeling burdened.

270
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:26,560
I thought that doing things on her bucket list would work on her.

271
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:33,330
- Take pictures of us.
 - Oh, okay.

272
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,300
It's really pretty!

273
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:37,360
- Hey, hey! 
 - Hey, where did you go?

274
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,510
Where did you go?

275
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:40,500
We should have gone together!

276
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,780
I want to take a picture.

277
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:44,510
- Of course, we should take one.
 - Hey, you're supposed to store these kinds of things with your eyes.

278
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:46,320
It's so pretty!

279
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,370
So pretty!

280
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:53,770
It's so pretty!

281
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,960
It's pretty here.

282
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:05,160
Really. It's so nice!

283
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:17,280
♬  I dream of it.  Please let us be eternally happy  ♬

284
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:21,970
 Hey, heart of mine. Why do you keep pounding nonstop? 

285
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:24,620
 Please come back to your senses! 

286
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:29,580
♬  Please let us have youthful days  ♬

287
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:39,550
♬  Even if there is a chill wind stinging us  ♬

288
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:49,320
♬  I dream of it.  Please let the days we smile be more  ♬

289
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:53,330
♬  than the days drenched in tears  ♬

290
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:07,020
Here, Here let's practice.

291
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:20,220
There you go again! You keep moving ahead. You should match the beat first.

292
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:21,910
Again.

293
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,570
Do it gently.

294
00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:30,540
I'm sorry. It's become a habit for me to use my strength.

295
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:32,070
Repeat it ten times.

296
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:36,120
If you still can't do it after I come and test you, you can't move to the next level.

297
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:40,230
Why can't I do it?

298
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:42,260
Is it that hard?

299
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:48,200
He hasn't called once today.

300
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:51,630
He told me to try him out or something, but is it his day off for that?

301
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:55,630
Yes, Nan Hee.

302
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:56,580
Bok Joo.

303
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:59,290
Did you make it back to school okay? Did you rest well at home?

304
00:23:59,290 --> 00:24:04,130
Yeah. I made it back okay, but Soon Ok couldn't come back.

305
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:07,130
 It seems like her family held her back. 

306
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,070
So, you're going to that girl Soon Ok's house?

307
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:15,670
Yes, I think I need to go. Her phone is off, and that is worrying me.

308
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:19,250
Really? Then,

309
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:22,960
think of this as going to get some air and go ahead.

310
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:30,460
Today is your day for dialysis right. Uncle also went out.

311
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:34,670
Yes. His excuse today is his friend's daughter's first birthday or something.

312
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:38,070
It looks like a lie but... Go quickly.

313
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:41,560
I'll be back, Dad.  Be sure to take a taxi.

314
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,700
I'll be back, Father.

315
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:51,770
 Sky and Earth Inn 

316
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:07,000


317
00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:29,060
Bok Joo!

318
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:32,330
Hey, why are you at the corner? It's very hard to find you.

319
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:35,100
Why did you come all the way down here?

320
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:39,090
Welcome! Stay right here for a moment.

321
00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:40,490
Do you want a room for a few hours or overnight?

322
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:41,630
A room for a few hours.

323
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:43,780
A room for a few hours costs you ₩20,000.

324
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:50,430
Bok Joo, go into this room for a while , I'll be there soon.

325
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:17,960
 Olympic Weightlifting 

326
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,610
Why are you standing? Have a seat.

327
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:30,900
Do you want a yogurt?

328
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:32,970
No thank you. I'm okay.

329
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:35,750
Still, drink it. This is the only one I can offer.

330
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:40,620
Thank you. I'll drink it well.

331
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:42,330
Sit down.

332
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:53,330
It seems like you came because you were worried. Did Nan Hee call you?

333
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:57,050
Yes. What happened?

334
00:26:57,050 --> 00:26:59,860
My mom and dad told me to drop out.

335
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:05,320
They said that I wouldn't be able to make it to the national competition anyway, and even if I join a pro team, my salary would be too low.

336
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:07,970
There's no guarantee that I'll be successful, either.

337
00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:13,650
They said that I should stop wasting money on tuition and just help out here. They're shorthanded here.

338
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:19,390
My parents hang wallpapers as part-time work, and my younger sibling is still young.

339
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:25,600
I couldn't find anything to say back to them. It's true that I'm not that talented at weightlifting.

340
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:29,510
Why? You won at your province's competition when you were in high school.

341
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:32,130
That's not talent, it's sweat.

342
00:27:32,930 --> 00:27:38,170
Guess what my name was in high school. It was Weightlifting Ghost Story.

343
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:43,350
They said that I lived in the weightlifting room every day, just like the ghosts in that story.

344
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:49,000
Back then, I didn't do weightlifting because I liked it. I did it because I hated being at home.

345
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:52,700
I hated working at the motel counter, too.

346
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:56,530
Back then, weightlifting was my only excuse to get away from here.

347
00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:03,850
But as I did it, I found that I came to like it more and more.

348
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:11,200
It's an honest sport, being recognized as much as the effort I put into lifting.

349
00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:15,440
I'm envious of you, Bok Joo.

350
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:20,830
You're talented, and you've got a father that puts his life on the line to support you.

351
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:27,220
I'd just be grateful if my parents didn't oppose it.

352
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:36,680
Soon Ok, I told you to get rid of the trash bags!

353
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:40,400
What is that? It looks ugly.

354
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,910
Hello.

355
00:28:43,910 --> 00:28:50,120
Mom, this is my friend Bok Joo. I told you about her a long time ago. She's the best one in our department.

356
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:53,660
Why did you come all the way out here? What about Soon Il's meal?

357
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:56,660
I haven't gotten it yet. Can't you just call and tell him to eat some ramyun?

358
00:28:56,660 --> 00:29:00,640
Why would you let him eat ramyun? We have rice dishes at home. Hurry up and go fix it.

359
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:04,350
Hang up the laundry from the washing machine while you're at it, too.

360
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:10,150
Soon Ok, I think I'll have to get going now.

361
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:13,090
No, you came all the way out here. Come home with me.

362
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:15,820
Eat some food and spend the night. Just leave tomorrow, okay?

363
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:18,720
No, my dad will worry about me. I'll leave first.

364
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,860
Good bye.

365
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:24,730
Yeah. Alright, go. Go back home.

366
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:48,350
 Hemo Dialysis 

367
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,900
Excuse me, are you all right?

368
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:07,760
Doctor Oh, please help me!

369
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:12,960
Whoever the young lady is, she must be happy.

370
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,560
You're going to give it to your girlfriend, right?

371
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:18,790
Yes, thank you.

372
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:21,540
- Thank you.
 - Yes, please come visit us again.

373
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,430
Ah, this should work at the very least.

374
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:35,770
Kim Bok Joo really is a woman, too. I thought that she'd throw a fuss and say that flowers aren't something you can even eat.

375
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:48,440
Oh, Jeong Joon Hyeong.

376
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,500
Where are you?!

377
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:53,020
I'm in Daejeon. I went to Soon Ok's house and I'm about to make my way back now.

378
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:54,820
Why did you go there?

379
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:59,070
It's a long story. I'll tell you later. I've got to get on the bus now.

380
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:02,350
Then you're riding the bus from Daejeon right now, right?

381
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:05,540
I got it. Be careful on your way.

382
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:09,970
Aigoo, seriously.

383
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:14,810
 Ready to go out Beauty Salon  

384
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:18,390
Done with preparation for a grand day out.

385
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:21,340
- Ah, really.
 - Aigoo, aigoo.

386
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:25,240
What should we do? Shall we watch a movie or get a couple's massage or someth—

387
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:28,720
Uncle. Wait a moment.

388
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:32,400
I'm really, really sorry.

389
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:35,160
But to be honest—

390
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:43,070
Yes, Professor.

391
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:47,060
I'm still talking with them at the school.

392
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:49,420
I'm asking them to let you come back, no matter what it takes.

393
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:52,050
So try not to make any hasty decisions.

394
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:55,710
I'm okay. Working at the beauty shop is doable, too.

395
00:31:55,710 --> 00:31:58,380
How about the kids? They are all doing well these days too, right?

396
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:02,090
I heard about Bok Joo from her uncle.

397
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:04,840
Well, it turned out that way.

398
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:08,620
She's just using this time to take a rest, that's all.

399
00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:13,650
Excuse me, Seong Eun. Here's some protein.

400
00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:15,730
Ah, I'm fine!

401
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:19,360
But when did you two become so close?

402
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,560
I didn't know that you were in a relationship where you see each other outside of work.

403
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:24,640
The thing is that, to be honest, Choi and I—

404
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,720
We are friends.

405
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,320
We're drinking buddies.

406
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:34,280
Drinking buddies? Of course, we all need one of those.

407
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,830
Have a glass.

408
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:38,090
Oh, wait. Wait, Professor.

409
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:41,680
Aish, you really should have been more careful.

410
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:44,660
Ah, this is...

411
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:50,780
 But as I did it, I found that I came to like weightlifting more and more. 

412
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:52,790
 It's an honest sport, 

413
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:55,860
 being recognized as much as the effort I put into lifting. 

414
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:59,400
  I'm envious of you, Bok Joo. 

415
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:04,250
 You're talented, and you've got a father that puts his life on the line to support you. 

416
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:10,700
 1 year ago 

417
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:41,130
 I lifted it! 

418
00:33:42,010 --> 00:33:46,570
 There was a time when I genuinely liked weightlifting, too. 

419
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:53,230
- Hello?
 - You're Kim Chang Geol's guardian, right? 

420
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:55,980
 This is Gangdong Hospital. 

421
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:58,960
What is it?

422
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:10,750
Wow, I got a bouquet of flowers and am giving her a free experience...

423
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:14,200
I'm doing all sorts of things because of Bok Joo.

424
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:18,310
Oh, Bok Joo!

425
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:21,840
Hey, Bok Joo! Bok Joo!

426
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:25,390
Joon Hyeong, I have to hurry up and go to the hospital. While Father was getting dialysis, he...

427
00:34:25,390 --> 00:34:27,150
- Hey, calm down, for now, Bok Joo.
 - I have to hurry up and go to the hospital!

428
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:30,030
What should I do? What should I do if something's really wrong with my dad?

429
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:31,490
He's at the hospital right now, isn't he?

430
00:34:31,490 --> 00:34:34,160
Then doctor must've treated him right away, right?

431
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:37,180
That's good, then. Let's go. I'll take you to the hospital.

432
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:46,320
Excuse me. I'm searching for a patient named Kim Chang Geol.

433
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,380
He is in room 1101.

434
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:48,970
- Room 1101?
 - Yes.

435
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:54,490
Bok Joo.

436
00:34:54,490 --> 00:34:57,990
Father. Father!

437
00:34:57,990 --> 00:34:59,700
Father.

438
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:06,620
Hyung!

439
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:11,730
Bok Joo's uncle, it's here.

440
00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:13,450
Hyung!

441
00:35:34,330 --> 00:35:37,430
Father, are you okay? You'll be okay, right?

442
00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:41,980
Hyung, I did wrong. Don't die.

443
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:46,070
Ah, you're so noisy! I'm fine. Why are you making such a fuss?

444
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:48,240
Don't get sick.

445
00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:52,930
Doctor. My father is okay, right?

446
00:35:52,930 --> 00:35:56,200
My hyung isn't dying, right? I can't live if he dies.

447
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:58,820
His condition isn't that critical,

448
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:02,660
but his blood phosphorous level is very high. Also, his blood creatine level is over 10.

449
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:05,750
He'll have to be admitted to the hospital for a few days and receive some close examinations,

450
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:08,640
but I think that it'll be best for him to get a transplant as quickly as possible.

451
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,090
A transplant?

452
00:36:10,090 --> 00:36:12,960
Try your best to stay as unstressed and calm as you can for today and tomorrow.

453
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,530
Yes.

454
00:36:14,530 --> 00:36:16,090
Thank you.

455
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:20,000
No. No, I'm sorry, Hyung.

456
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,940
Father, Father.

457
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:27,460
Let's have a glass of drink.

458
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:32,880
Long time no see, Jae Yi.

459
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:35,710
Alright, let's have a toast.

460
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:38,450
Me too, me too!

461
00:36:38,450 --> 00:36:41,940
Wow, you guys were like this in school, too. You're still really sticking together.

462
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:46,070
Don't be like that. You two should just get married. It's comfortable and nice.

463
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:47,790
You want to? Should we get married?

464
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:51,660
Hey, that's not something that you should say so easily.

465
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:55,800
Ah, I got rejected. It hurts my pride.

466
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:02,990
Oh my god. Hey, it's Sunbae Sang Gu and Hwan Hee.

467
00:37:02,990 --> 00:37:06,930
I got a call from Sunbae Sang Gu earlier, and I told him we'd meet up today.

468
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:09,000
Hey, I didn't know that he'd come.

469
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:14,860
Hey, mates, it's been a long while. I'm happy to see you.

470
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:16,970
Have you all been well?

471
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:42,850
Have you been well, Oppa?

472
00:37:42,850 --> 00:37:44,500
Yes.

473
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:47,570
What about you?

474
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:49,550
Oh, well.

475
00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:54,410
You haven't changed at all, Oppa.

476
00:37:54,410 --> 00:37:57,090
I was really surprised when I saw you earlier

477
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:01,990
because you look just the same as you did in my memories.

478
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:26,270
Let's have a toast, Jeong Jae Yi. It's been a really long time.

479
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:29,970
I'm going to stop drinking. I've got to work tomorrow.

480
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:33,110
I see you still act like a nerd.

481
00:38:34,350 --> 00:38:37,700
You were like that back then before, too. You were really upright

482
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:41,840
and really nice. Women really liked you, too.

483
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,960
Isn't he just your style?

484
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:46,220
Why are you bringing up the past?

485
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:49,000
You like this style now, too.

486
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,590
Hey, you said that you don't like me because I've got no manners.

487
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:55,390
Hey, she rejected me big time.

488
00:38:55,390 --> 00:38:58,200
It's because she really doesn't like me,

489
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:01,830
or it's because she still can't forget you.

490
00:39:01,830 --> 00:39:06,960
I'm going to leave first. Sorry, guys. Let's meet again next time.

491
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:10,780
Hey, why? I'll be upset if you leave.

492
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:14,770
Hwan Hee must've looked forward to seeing you by counting the days.

493
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:16,730
Let her look at you a little longer.

494
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:21,440
Sit down, you punk. I said sit down, punk. Sit down!

495
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:26,190
Stop it. I think you'll regret this when you sober up tomorrow.

496
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:30,970
Hey, I'm not drunk right now.

497
00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:33,690
I'm just stating the facts right now.

498
00:39:33,690 --> 00:39:37,590
Hey, you're looking forward to seeing him, right?  Look at him as much as you please.

499
00:39:37,590 --> 00:39:41,030
Why are you acting like this, seriously? You're drunk. If you're going to act like this, then let's just leave.

500
00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:43,860
Hey. Look at him all you want.

501
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:46,710
Huh? Look at him to your heart's content, right now!

502
00:39:55,530 --> 00:39:57,290
Jae Yi. Jae Yi!

503
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:06,860
It's not like you didn't know Sunbae Sang Gu speaks badly.

504
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:09,160
You should've let his words go in one ear and out the other.

505
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:11,850
Why'd you go so far as to punch him?

506
00:40:11,850 --> 00:40:15,770
Are you a kid? Are you a youth in the middle of puberty?

507
00:40:15,770 --> 00:40:18,390
Why did a rational guy like you,

508
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:22,730
who doesn't even get worked up easily, get that angry?

509
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:28,900
Did you do it because Sunbae Sang Gu offended you? Or was it because of Hwan Hee?

510
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:35,790
By any chance, do you still have feelings for Hwan Hee?

511
00:40:35,790 --> 00:40:37,000
No, it's not like that.

512
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,480
No? Then what exactly  is it?

513
00:40:41,070 --> 00:40:43,770
That damn first love is really so sickening.

514
00:40:43,770 --> 00:40:49,270
Isn't it time for you to let go of her and to do some dating?

515
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:52,600
Let's go. It's getting late.

516
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:55,430
How long are you going to overlook me?

517
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:02,530
You're saying you didn't know?

518
00:41:02,530 --> 00:41:06,150
Do you think I have stuck to you

519
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:10,060
like your shadow for ten years only for the sake of our friendship?

520
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:11,790
Ah Yeong.

521
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:17,870
Judging from your facial expression, it seems you really didn't know.

522
00:41:20,370 --> 00:41:26,670
So you've never once thought of me as your partner, even in your dreams.

523
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:33,620
Even though I sensed that it was that way,  still after confirming it,  I feel more miserable.

524
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:36,240
Ah Yeong.

525
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:41,420
That's right. I'm sick of my own feelings now, too.

526
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:44,100
I'm also tired of having false hope.

527
00:41:44,790 --> 00:41:47,800
It would be better to just quit now.

528
00:41:48,990 --> 00:41:50,840
The end.

529
00:42:07,850 --> 00:42:12,140
Ah, forget it. Go! It's fine if your uncle is here.

530
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:14,970
I don't want to. I want to stay here too.

531
00:42:14,970 --> 00:42:19,930
Bok Joo, just leave. There's only one bed for the guardian here. It's narrow even with just me sleeping on it.

532
00:42:19,930 --> 00:42:24,090
Go quickly. Why do you come and uncomfortably bustle here?

533
00:42:24,090 --> 00:42:26,700
Do you think all of our family came here for vacation?

534
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:29,320
But still I want to be here too.

535
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:33,730
You're annoying me. Leave. I want to rest now, too.

536
00:42:33,730 --> 00:42:37,760
Then I'll go downstairs and buy some things for you to use. You don't even have any tissue.

537
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:06,020
 Bok Chicken 

538
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:15,170
 We're closing temporarily for the afternoon.
 Bok Chicken - 

539
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:36,270
 We're closing for several days. 

540
00:43:53,370 --> 00:43:55,770
Ah, some thermal underwear. It's cold.

541
00:44:00,370 --> 00:44:02,370
What's this? Is it something important?

542
00:44:02,370 --> 00:44:03,870
  Insurance Certificates 

543
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:06,870
What the heck? Why are there so many?

544
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:20,280
Hey! What the...

545
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:24,470
Father, what are we going to do with this money if you die?

546
00:44:24,470 --> 00:44:27,400
You should get a newer scooter instead of spending money here.

547
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:30,590
Father, you really!

548
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:35,430
Father.

549
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:49,620
Ah, really! Father, you really!

550
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:51,900
What is all this?!

551
00:44:55,490 --> 00:44:59,380
Ah, Father!

552
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:04,840
What's this?

553
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:31,550
Why aren't you sleeping?

554
00:45:31,550 --> 00:45:34,270
Father, did you sleep?

555
00:45:34,270 --> 00:45:39,050
I should sleep. Why aren't you?

556
00:45:39,050 --> 00:45:41,590
Are you scared because you're alone?

557
00:45:41,590 --> 00:45:43,850
Am I a little kid?

558
00:45:45,510 --> 00:45:47,600
Father.

559
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:54,770
Father, I'm sorry.

560
00:45:56,150 --> 00:45:59,640
What are you sorry for, you rascal?

561
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:03,730
For everything. I'm sorry for everything.

562
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:07,880
I'm sorry for making you worry,

563
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:12,500
and I'm sorry for not listening to you when you told me not to do deliveries.

564
00:46:14,510 --> 00:46:18,690
I'm sorry for being rude and calling you Boss Kim.

565
00:46:18,690 --> 00:46:24,670
I'm sorry for complaining that the kimbap that you made for me in elementary school wasn't pretty, too.

566
00:46:26,470 --> 00:46:29,580
Shut up, you brat.

567
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:32,460
If you talk like then, then I feel sorrier.

568
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:36,220
 I'm sorry for making you do weightlifting, 

569
00:46:36,220 --> 00:46:41,570
 and I'm sorry for getting you involved with  a greasy-smelling chicken business. 

570
00:46:41,570 --> 00:46:44,970
 But the thing that I'm most sorry about 

571
00:46:46,730 --> 00:46:49,530
is you not being able to experience

572
00:46:52,090 --> 00:46:54,460
what it's like to have a mom

573
00:46:54,460 --> 00:46:57,940
while you were growing up as such a little kid.

574
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:04,520
Why is that your fault? It's Mom's fault for dying first.

575
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:07,230
But still, I'm sorry.

576
00:47:07,230 --> 00:47:09,660
On your mom's behalf

577
00:47:11,070 --> 00:47:13,750
I'm really sorry.

578
00:47:15,230 --> 00:47:20,730
You don't know how sorry I felt the entire time you were growing up.

579
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:26,190
No, I'm the one who should be sorry.

580
00:47:26,190 --> 00:47:30,230
I'm really really sorry, Father.

581
00:47:32,470 --> 00:47:36,840
Okay, sleep. Sleep well.

582
00:47:56,770 --> 00:47:59,200
Father.

583
00:48:31,870 --> 00:48:34,440
You're here, Professor? Did you have breakfast?

584
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:40,810
It seems like you overslept. Your hair strands are building an apartment.

585
00:48:40,810 --> 00:48:45,100
Bok Joo. What happened with you? Have you come back?

586
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:49,110
The second-year weightlifting student of Haneul Sports University has ended her short school vacation

587
00:48:49,110 --> 00:48:53,640
and has returned to complete winter training. That is all. Loyalty!

588
00:48:57,170 --> 00:48:59,720
It's been a long time since I've seen you smile.

589
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:04,140
That's right. You're our weightlifter, after all.

590
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:06,700
Good job. You did well.

591
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:11,230
You brat, this weightlifting room has seemed so empty because you weren't here.

592
00:49:11,230 --> 00:49:14,270
I'm sorry for making you worry, Professor.

593
00:49:14,270 --> 00:49:20,580
It's nothing. I'm thankful to you for not dragging it out too long and coming back.

594
00:49:21,470 --> 00:49:26,210
Ah, this weightlifting room has become a total mess just because I left for a little while.

595
00:49:26,210 --> 00:49:30,190
The freshmen should be making sure they clean up properly. Those little kids are seriously slacking.

596
00:49:30,190 --> 00:49:32,360
I'm going to call a meeting for the freshmen, Professor.

597
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:36,730
Yes, you give them a good scolding. Now, they will be all dead.

598
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:40,560
Wow, Unnie Bok Joo!

599
00:49:41,470 --> 00:49:42,310
Hello!

600
00:49:42,310 --> 00:49:45,630
Hey! What happened to you? Are you coming back?

601
00:49:45,630 --> 00:49:47,440
Why did you suddenly jump ship?

602
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:51,170
It's not because of us, is it? We didn't  give you a hard time. Did you get an illness somewhere?

603
00:49:51,170 --> 00:49:54,830
If you're sick, then you should tell us. You made your sunbaes worry about you too.

604
00:49:54,830 --> 00:49:57,370
I committed a sin worthy of death. I'll do well from now on!

605
00:49:57,370 --> 00:50:01,220
No, it's fine since you came. Let's stop.

606
00:50:01,220 --> 00:50:03,200
Look at her. She's crying. She's crying.

607
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:08,570
Kim Bok Joo. Ah, Bok Joo!

608
00:50:09,970 --> 00:50:12,470
Ah, why are you acting like this, seriously? You're overreacting.

609
00:50:12,470 --> 00:50:17,920
Soon Ok didn't come either! Do you know how lonely I was?

610
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:20,610
If you ever quit weightlifting again,

611
00:50:20,610 --> 00:50:23,410
I'll crush you with barbells.

612
00:50:23,410 --> 00:50:27,370
Aigoo, how scary! So scary! I won't do it again. I'm sorry.

613
00:50:27,370 --> 00:50:29,970
Woon Gi, warm everyone up and get ready for training.

614
00:50:29,970 --> 00:50:31,770
Yes, I understand. Let's warm up!

615
00:50:31,770 --> 00:50:34,970
- Okay!
 - We understand!

616
00:50:36,030 --> 00:50:40,220
If Soon Ok was here, our Three Musketeers would revive. It's too bad.

617
00:50:40,220 --> 00:50:43,340
Actually, I went to see Soon Ok yesterday.

618
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:45,790
What did she say? When did she say she was coming?

619
00:50:45,790 --> 00:50:48,670
She said that she thinks it'll be hard for her to come back for a while.

620
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:53,630
I missed you. It's been so hard for me.

621
00:50:53,630 --> 00:50:58,020
I had ghosts... ghosts in my dreams too.

622
00:50:58,020 --> 00:51:02,970
I didn't even have Soon Ok next to me!

623
00:51:02,970 --> 00:51:04,920
- Who did you eat with?
- I ate alone.

624
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:07,900
I'm really sorry. I committed a sin worthy of death.

625
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:24,880
Si Ho, what are you doing?

626
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:29,860
What are you doing to do if you make a mistake that even junior high students don't  make?

627
00:51:30,570 --> 00:51:32,910
Why are you like this?

628
00:51:32,910 --> 00:51:37,430
How much experience do you have so you even don't control your stress for the competition?

629
00:51:37,430 --> 00:51:42,790
I can't help but check you again tomorrow to decide whether I let you go to the competition or not.

630
00:51:42,790 --> 00:51:45,640
- Do you understand?
 - Yes.

631
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:54,990
So hot!

632
00:52:00,890 --> 00:52:07,280
 So, you've never thought of me as your partner, even in your dreams. 

633
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:09,860
 I'm really tired of my feelings now. 

634
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:12,880
 I think stopping here would be the best. 

635
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:15,200
 The end. 

636
00:52:34,060 --> 00:52:36,040
Yes, hello.

637
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:39,790
Oppa Jae Yi. It's me, Hwan Hee.

638
00:52:40,850 --> 00:52:42,830
Oh, okay.

639
00:52:43,820 --> 00:52:46,510
I'm sorry about yesterday.

640
00:52:46,510 --> 00:52:49,710
Sunbae is a little sensitive nowadays.

641
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:52,620
Ah.

642
00:52:54,090 --> 00:53:02,040
And, back then. I couldn't even apologize to you properly,

643
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:05,210
and it always bothered me.

644
00:53:06,780 --> 00:53:11,280
Okay. Thank you for calling.

645
00:53:12,740 --> 00:53:15,770
I hope you'll live well.

646
00:53:39,820 --> 00:53:42,530
Ah, I'm really going crazy!

647
00:53:56,470 --> 00:54:01,480
  I have to check you again tomorrow to decide whether I let you go to the competition or not. 

648
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:20,860
You went back to school?

649
00:54:21,710 --> 00:54:24,270
Ah, really?

650
00:54:26,070 --> 00:54:28,470
Ah, well, she is not a tree frog (doing the opposite of what one is told to do)?

651
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:34,680
I told  you to rest to your heart's content because it was a hard decision, but why did you go back?

652
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:38,940
I got it, you rascal. Do whatever you want.

653
00:54:38,940 --> 00:54:41,860
It's your life, not mine.

654
00:54:41,860 --> 00:54:45,780
Me? I'm getting discharged tomorrow afternoon.

655
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:49,910
Ah, don't come. You said you needed to practice. Hang up.

656
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:54,730
Why? Did Bok Joo go back to weightlifting?

657
00:54:54,730 --> 00:54:59,040
She said that she went back. Aigoo, that annoying little rascal. Aigoo!

658
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:12,160
♬  Something within me is dying   ♬

659
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:18,200

660
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:24,120

663
00:55:37,050 --> 00:55:38,770
Oh, Bok Joo.

664
00:55:38,770 --> 00:55:41,860
It's me. Where are you right now?

665
00:55:41,860 --> 00:55:43,580
I'm at the swimming pool.

666
00:55:43,580 --> 00:55:47,780
I was curious anyway. Where are you? The hospital?

667
00:55:47,780 --> 00:55:51,920
I'm at school now. Can you see me for a minute?

668
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:57,280
♬  Or will you wait  so that you won't regret   ♬

670

♬  I'm going to pick you up right now.  ♬

671
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:12,000
♬  Because you and I are  painted and covered  ♬

672
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:18,640
♬  in pretty colors like a rainbow  ♬

673
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:22,200
Wow! It's snowing.

674
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:25,130
It's pretty!

675
00:56:25,940 --> 00:56:27,650
Hey, Bok Joo!

676
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:30,960
Why did you run here? You should've taken your time.

677
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:33,020
I worried that you would be cold. When did you come?

678
00:56:33,020 --> 00:56:35,470
What about Father? Is he okay?

679
00:56:35,470 --> 00:56:38,300
The doctors ran some tests, and they said he's not in critical condition.

680
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:42,100
They just said that it would be best for him to hurry up and get a kidney transplant, and that we should do it quickly.

681
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:45,130
That's a relief. I worried a lot.

682
00:56:45,130 --> 00:56:50,690
Thank you. If it weren't for you yesterday, I think I would have really been lost.

683
00:56:50,690 --> 00:56:55,410
When I heard about Father, I only saw white in front of me and I couldn't think at all.

684
00:56:55,410 --> 00:56:58,470
Well, your face looked like a steamed white rice cake.

685
00:56:58,470 --> 00:57:00,790
Really?

686
00:57:00,790 --> 00:57:03,970
Oh, it's really snowing a lot.

687
00:57:03,970 --> 00:57:07,280
You're right. There's a lot.

688
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:13,220
Joon Hyeong.

689
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:16,550
I went back to weightlifting today.

690
00:57:16,550 --> 00:57:19,050
- Really? 
- Yes, for real.

691
00:57:19,050 --> 00:57:23,960
You did well. You were the most like Kim Bok Joo when you were in the weightlifting department.

692
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:27,170
That's how I thought too. Weightlifting, swag!

693
00:57:27,170 --> 00:57:29,890
Swag!

694
00:57:29,930 --> 00:57:35,070
But, when I came back to the school this morning, I strangely thought of you first.

695
00:57:35,070 --> 00:57:41,800
After training, I thought, "Oh, I have to hurry up and tell Joon Hyeong about my return."

696
00:57:43,850 --> 00:57:46,510
Joon Hyeong.

697
00:57:48,950 --> 00:57:53,230
I don't want to return you. I'm going to keep you.

698
00:57:55,060 --> 00:57:58,610
I think I like you too.

699
00:57:58,610 --> 00:58:03,160
No. I do like you.

700
00:58:04,820 --> 00:58:11,190
Well, as a friend or as a man, I want you to continue to be next to me.

701
00:58:11,210 --> 00:58:14,030
I want you to keep calling my name too.

702
00:58:14,030 --> 00:58:18,390
Bok Joo is good. Fatty is good too.

703
00:58:18,390 --> 00:58:28,070
♬  Dozens of times between a faint hope and anxiety  ♬

704
00:58:28,090 --> 00:58:36,110
♬  Time repeatedly quickens its pace and  ♬

705
00:58:36,110 --> 00:58:48,370
♬  Without being aware we are on the edge of the road.  ♬

706
00:58:48,370 --> 00:58:56,600
♬  I dream of it.  Please let us be eternally happy  ♬
