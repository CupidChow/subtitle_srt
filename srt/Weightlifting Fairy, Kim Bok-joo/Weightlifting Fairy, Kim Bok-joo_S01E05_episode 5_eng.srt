1
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:35,380


2
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:52,040
What are you doing here, Fatty?

3
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:10,200
You. Look at your state. Why?

4
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,050
Joon Hyeong.

5
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:14,710
What brings you here without calling beforehand?

6
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:16,830
- Oh, Hyung.
 -  Hyung? 

7
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:21,220
I came to fix my bike and thought that I could get some food from you.

8
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,330
Do you two know each other?

9
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:29,350
- She goes to the same—
 - We're classmates.

10
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:31,710
Elementary school classmates.

11
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:36,850
Wow, Jeong Joon Hyeong! It's been such a long time! How could we meet at a place like this?

12
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:41,620
- H-Has it been ten years since we last met? Wow, I didn't recognize you at first glance.
 -  10 years? 

13
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:46,070
Wow, I guess the world really is a small place.

14
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:49,950
She's the music major student I told you about before, the one who plays the cello.

15
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:53,920
Bok Joo is that student, you rascal.

16
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:57,330
Chel... cello?!

17
00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:59,990
Cello?

18
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,820
Ah ha! You major in the cello!

19
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:23,040
Well, you were talented in music even in elementary school.

20
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,890
She sang very well, like a nightingale.

21
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:26,840
Nightingale?

22
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:32,440
Wow, I guess you two were really close. You even remember those small details.

23
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,470
Of course. We were almost buddies.

24
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:39,480
Anyway, it's nice to meet you, Kim Bok Joo! I think we can have fun from now on, right?

25
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,380
Yeah, nice to meet you.

26
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:47,160
Wow, how can such a fate like this exist?

27
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:50,260
Bok Joo, I guess we are fated together, right?

28
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:52,890
You were even classmates with my younger brother.

29
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:55,340
Wow, how did you play the cello that—

30
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:56,850
Bok Joo is really strong.

31
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:59,990
Indeed. To lift a cello, you have to be as strong as a weightlifter.

32
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:02,310
I like classical music too.

33
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:19,460
This is a dream! A coincidence like this cannot exist!

34
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:22,710
Why? They don't resemble each other at all!

35
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:25,510
How can such a crappy situation like this exist?!

36
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:29,500
Hey! Cellist Kim Bok Joo!

37
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:35,530
We should go together! I think our destination is the same!

38
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:42,950
  Episode 5: I'm Happy Because I'm a Woman 

39
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:51,630
The cello?

40
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:56,790
Well, the cello is much better suited for the size of your arms rather than the violin or flute.

41
00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:01,090
As expected, our Fatty really knows her place.

42
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:03,850
Stop acting frivolous.

43
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:08,540
Hey, are you getting mad at me?

44
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:12,180
How can you use the word "frivolous" with your life saver who prevented you from being exposed?

45
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:15,170
Uh-huh! How did you use an inappropriate word?!

46
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:16,610
Is he really your older brother?

47
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:20,030
Of course, we're real brothers. Would we be fake brothers?

48
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:24,040
When did you start attending there?

49
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:27,840
If you just went there to lose weight, then you would have

50
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,510
no reason to lie about being a music major.

51
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:33,170
That means that you have an ulterior motive.

52
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:45,400
You... You fell for my older brother, didn't you?

53
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,010
That's why you go there, right?

54
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:50,930
Hey, that's nonsense! Your sense of imagination is amazing.

55
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:55,110
Hey, even if I'm obsessing over a man, would I really spend so much money to go there?

56
00:04:55,110 --> 00:05:00,470
Then why do you spend so much money to go there, Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo?

57
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:05,220
T-That is... Hey, Dayfly!

58
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:11,030
You grew up a lot, though. Now, you know how to do all sorts of things because of a man.

59
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:15,870
But, won't there be trouble if your club finds out?

60
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:19,400
A weightlifter attends an obesity clinic?

61
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,800
Ugh! Hey! Hey!

62
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:26,620
You'll keep my secret, won't you?

63
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:29,070
Of course, I have to keep it.

64
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:32,220
I won't benefit at all from exposing that.

65
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:34,150
Hey,

66
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,020
you thought I would do that, didn't you?

67
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:44,730
I don't think there's a specific reason I have to keep your secret.

68
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:49,640
I'll decide based on what you do.

69
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:54,750
What now? "What I do"? Why base it on what I do?! This—

70
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:57,950
Hey, are you getting mad at me right now?

71
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:01,300
No, my voice is naturally loud.

72
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:04,020
I-Is that why I sounded mad?

73
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:06,790
No, you definitely got mad.

74
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:10,320
- I didn't get mad.
 - Ah, I'm about to be upset.

75
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,810
I said, I didn't get mad.

76
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:17,010
- I didn't get mad.
 - I'll have to think about it.

77
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:19,790
Think about what? I told you, I didn't get mad.

78
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:22,610
- I'm leaving first. 
- Hey, I said I didn't get mad.

79
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:27,400
Hey! Hey! I-I'm sorry!

80
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:33,480
What do I do?

81
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:39,110
Wow! Kim Bok Joo, she's seriously amazing!

82
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:42,250
Out of all people to fall for, how could she fall for my older brother?

83
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:54,760
Out of all people, why does it have to be that loser, Jeong Joon Hyeong?!

84
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,420
Fish cutlets!

85
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:09,960
- Goodness.
 - Hey!

86
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,720
Hey, hey, sit down gently.

87
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:15,710
- This much is fine.
 - What's fine? You have to be careful.

88
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:18,040
Would she need to carry a donut cushion?

89
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,380
Hey, hey, are you planning to announce it? Why would you carry that around?

90
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:24,180
Okay. For a while, we'll exclude Bok Joo from carrying  all our trays after eating.

91
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:26,570
- This is our friendship swag.
 - Swag.

92
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:28,280
Swag...

93
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:45,090
It's really nice to see you. So, did you have a nice sleep last night?

94
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:50,440
- Hey, I'm done eating. I'll leave first.
 - You're not finished. You just took a spoonful.

95
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:54,120
Why do you act like you're socially  avoiding the opposite sex although we're the classmates? It's disappointing. Sit down!

96
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,040
What are you doing? Sit down.

97
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:01,010
Come on, it's not as if we're strangers. Let's eat together, sit down.

98
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:03,440
Please excuse me.

99
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:18,540
Ugh, why am I lacking strength in my hand today?

100
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:22,600
Fatty, this, please.

101
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:24,750
What?

102
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,020
Cut it for me.

103
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:32,910
Don't cut them too small.

104
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:54,620
I'm sorry, but could you get me some water over there too.

105
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:57,470
Half-cold, half-hot. Mix them

106
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,220
Hey, punk.

107
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:06,980
Do you not have hands or feet? Hey, I'll just get it for you.

108
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:10,340
No, I'll just go.

109
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:13,570
I was thirsty too anyway.

110
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,020
Seven to three!

111
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:22,780
I mean, six to four.

112
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:41,180
It's sweet. Why is the water so sweet today?

113
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:51,090
What's with you? Do you have something going on with Jeong Joon Hyeong?

114
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:53,740
What are you talking about? Nothing's going on.

115
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:56,220
Then, why are you in a servant mode all of a sudden?

116
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,950
Didn't you hate him?

117
00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:00,990
You're someone who doesn't even get us water. Something sure is strange.

118
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:03,190
What's strange?

119
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:06,520
Can't classmates even get water for each other anymore?

120
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:10,010
I mean, after spending some time with him, he didn't seem like a bad kid.

121
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:15,140
Although he is a bit immature, I have to embrace that side of him. What else can I do? We're classmates.

122
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:17,340
If you were planning to embrace him, you should have embraced him from the start.

123
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:20,450
Abruptly, unexpectedly, suddenly?

124
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:24,620
That's what I'm saying. By any chance, are you sure there isn't something else?

125
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:26,370
Something else? What else?!

126
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:29,150
Then would I be doing this because I like him?

127
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:32,950
Or would I be doing this because he got me in my sore spot? Why are you so sensitive to this?

128
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:37,560
By next week, my porcelain skin will be ruined again.

129
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:40,110
You don't even understand why you're saying your elephant skin  is equivalent to the porcelain skin.

130
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:42,350
 J Weight Management Clinic: Ms. Kim Bok Joo, you have been scheduled for the 5 o'clock appointment.  
 But it's not like I'm any better either.

131
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:44,260
Still, we have to be part of the sports competition!

132
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:47,020
This is the only time we'll ever get to put bricks on our shoulders!

133
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:50,960
You're right. After winning in the end, we'll probably get another loaded meal, right?

134
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,020
Of course!

135
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:56,460
E-Excuse me, hey. I'm going to leave first, I have to go to the hospital.

136
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:57,580
Okay.

137
00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:01,370
Hey, if the coaches and sunbaes look for you, we'll cover for you.

138
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:02,970
Thanks so much, I'm going.

139
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:08,440
Be careful on your way.

140
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:12,280
The walking way just looks so uncomfortable. It's a pity.

141
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,860
Really?

142
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:33,100
26.27 seconds, your head is coming up when you swim. Pay attention, Joon Hyeong.

143
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,010
Go! Hurry!

144
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:36,150
I'm so tired...

145
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:40,130
One, two! Right! Streamline! Streamline! Kick!

146
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:52,680
If I stay in the dorms I'll get caught by the little boss right away.

147
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:57,340
Fatty!

148
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:03,490
I think I can tell where you're going.

149
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:08,400
Okay! Kim Bok Joo, I've chosen you.

150
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:16,690
You're doing well with maintaining but stagnating a little bit.

151
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:20,000
It isn't easy, is it, losing weight in a healthy way.

152
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,980
Yes, a bit. I've been diligent with my sit-ups too.

153
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,780
You're doing well.

154
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:30,130
I'm just saying, we shouldn't get too greedy by getting ahead of ourselves.

155
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:34,690
- But Ms. Bok Joo, I guess you haven't changed a bit since you were young.
- Excuse me?

156
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:38,530
I mean, that was judging by the way Joon Hyeong recognized you right away.

157
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:40,240
Joon Hyeong's changed a lot, hasn't he?

158
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,340
Yes... I couldn't recognize him at first either.

159
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:47,020
Of course, you didn't. He's so tall, and his personality is the way it is now.

160
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:49,800
He was probably shyer when he was younger.

161
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:53,010
You're right. But wow!

162
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:58,730
He's so half-assed, and every word he says is just him being crafty. I just wanna pound—

163
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:03,890
You saw him for just a moment that day. How'd you figure all that out?

164
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:06,020
This is so fascinating!

165
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:10,520
Oh, it really was just a moment, but he's just so  different  from how he was when he was younger.

166
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:14,170
You're right, there is a bit of a gap there.

167
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:17,070
But to make up for that, he's got a nice-looking face!

168
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:20,060
I wonder. I didn't really see...

169
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:22,990
Why? Everyone always says Joon Hyeong's better than me.

170
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:24,630
That's not true!

171
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:28,550
Doctor, you're two-million times more handsome than him!

172
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:33,220
I'm grateful for you seeing it that way,

173
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:36,870
but I can't really be ecstatic about being called more handsome than my little brother, what with the gentle reputation I have.

174
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:40,680
But you really are two-million times more handsome.

175
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:44,780
Really? Let's see...

176
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:53,620
Should we proceed with the treatment?

177
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:58,570
Ms. Ji Yeon, how many appointments do we have left today?

178
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:01,980
Patient Joo Hye Jeong changed her six o'clock appointment to tomorrow.

179
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:03,270
Is that so?

180
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:05,910
- Then let's all go home early today.
 - Really?

181
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:07,100
Hi, Brother!

182
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:09,950
What the heck? Why do you come looking for me so often these days?

183
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:12,120
So what. You're not happy to see me?

184
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,980
Should I go back?

185
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,250
It's because I'm happy, punk.

186
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:21,730
I'm actually here to get dinner from you. I didn't get to last time and it was such a waste.

187
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:25,500
Anyhow, you really do slack off, just like someone said.

188
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,960
Who? Who said I slack off?

189
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,480
Who is it? Who?!

190
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,020
Who! Oh!

191
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:32,380
 What? 

192
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:34,490
My dear peer, you were here?

193
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:37,270
I had no idea you were here.

194
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:39,050
Hello.

195
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:40,880
I'm going to eat dinner with my brother, come with us.

196
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,870
It's not like you're starving yourself just because you're on a diet.

197
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:45,140
He's right, let's go together! You could use the salad bar too.

198
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:47,850
No. The thing is that I have something to do.

199
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:49,540
Really? Then let's eat, just the two of us.

200
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:55,420
We can be two brothers, all cozied up and talking about this and that!

201
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:57,510
Where will you be eating?

202
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:07,080
Bok Joo, do you see this?

203
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,500
Wow, this...

204
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:29,740
You want to eat this. Here you go.

205
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,490
 He's so sweet. 

206
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,130
This is spicy konjac salad.

207
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:48,000
There's a lot of fiber but not a lot of calories so you can eat up without worrying.

208
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,420
Thank you, Doctor.

209
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:52,580
Hey.

210
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:54,910
Hyung, as expected, you're the icon of sweet and caring.

211
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:59,310
How would women not  fall  for you when you're this way, huh?

212
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:01,490
Oh my, Bok Joo, be careful!

213
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:05,460
I already feel so sad for you, watching you eat up grass because you're on a diet!

214
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:07,960
That weight no, the bar no.

215
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:11,420
You'll probably need a lot of strength to hold up a cello.

216
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:15,170
I'm so grateful that you're so considerate, I think I'm going to cry.

217
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:19,810
It's tiring isn't it? Going through treatments while you're doing music.

218
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:22,790
No, it's alright.

219
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:25,620
Of course, she's strong. She was born with that strength!

220
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:27,300
Look at this arm!

221
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:30,680
Wow, now that I think of it, it's an arm that would do really well during the sports competition!

222
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:38,250
For example, stuff like this, "Yeah! 130kg!"

223
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:40,980
No, I'm not really skilled in that area.

224
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:42,800
Why?

225
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,580
You like soccer, though! Messi!

226
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,300
Messi?

227
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:51,040
Oh, the... When she first came to the hospital, she asked,

228
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:55,120
"Do you like Messi?" She seemed like a real fan!

229
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:59,160
  By any chance do you like Messi?  

230
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:06,590
- Of course, I am. I am Messi's fan.
-  Ah...

231
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:10,820
Oh, Bok Joo's a fan of Messi too.

232
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:13,490
Oh right! Did you see the goal yesterday?

233
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:20,210
Wow, it was a free kick goal but he kicked from that angle like—

234
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,150
Wait a moment. I'm sorry.

235
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:26,220
No, I'm not busy.

236
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:35,880
Hey. Is "Do you like Messi" a catchphrase you guys are trying to make popular?

237
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,420
And is Messi aware of this cruel reality?!

238
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:42,000
Aside from that, exactly how much longer are you going to keep this up!

239
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,750
What? What did I keep up?

240
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:46,910
You little punk! You really don't know!?

241
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:49,080
I'll just take this damn—

242
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:52,090
You should drink some water while you eat! You might get indigestion!

243
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:54,770
Oh sorry!

244
00:17:54,770 --> 00:18:00,290
He's a close friend. Oh right, the goal! This was art! Did you see it?

245
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:01,730
No, I watched weightlifting yesterday.

246
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:03,350
What weightlifting, at that time of night.

247
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:09,950
I was like, watching and they just, BOOM, lifted that bar!

248
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:11,950
Oh, please eat.

249
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:21,320
Joon Hyeong, get in! Ms. Bok Joo, you too!

250
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,640
Okay! Cool guy!

251
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:26,050
I'll be a complete shuttle driver today, so please, get in!

252
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:30,020
W-Wait! We just need to talk about something really fast, just us two.

253
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:33,170
What "talk"?! We already talked!

254
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:37,220
It's been ten years. What do you mean we don't have anything to catch up. Let's chat for a bit.

255
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:41,650
She's right, the two of you go play! You still have time before your curfew.

256
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:43,620
I'll be going first then. See you at the medical office.

257
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:46,500
- Please get there safe, Doctor!
- Take good care of her, punk.

258
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,440
No, Hyung! You have to take me!

259
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:51,520
Hyung! You have to take me, though!

260
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,580
- Hyung, you have to take me!
- Please get there safely! Drive safely!

261
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:56,610
Hyung.

262
00:18:57,410 --> 00:18:59,190
Hyung, do you want to see me dying?

263
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:01,520
Hyung! Take me. Hyung!

264
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,090
Follow me while I'm being nice.

265
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:07,530
Jeong Joon Hyeong, let's go quietly.

266
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:11,710
Hey! Why lower your voice like that?  It's even scarier!

267
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:25,780
Why'd we come to a place like this...

268
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:28,960
Jeong Joon Hyeong!

269
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:33,550
I said don't lower your voice! I'm freaking freaked out right now.

270
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:38,510
It can't be you're trying to discreetly—

271
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,720
Bury me somewhere, right?

272
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,240
- Let's make a deal.
- What deal?

273
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:47,510
Being so timid around you, always so anxious about what you're going to say.

274
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:51,370
I can't live like this. I can't do this!

275
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:54,460
Let's end this with one big hit.

276
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,810
H-Hit?

277
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:59,500
W-What kind of big hit?

278
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:02,130
You decide.

279
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:15,020
Now. Do you want to punch me once?

280
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:17,520
Aigoo, you startled me.

281
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:21,090
If you're going to swerve in with that large vehicle and then use your blinkers!

282
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:22,890
And what am I, a gangster?!

283
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:27,520
Then what? Money?

284
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,490
Then if it is money, how much will you give me?

285
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:36,430
I don't have money in my wallet, but I can do my best to come up with some!

286
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:40,740
How much is it going to cost for you to shut up and stop trying to bleed a person out.

287
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:45,890
I'm not sure.

288
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:50,850
In my position, I've got nothing but fun having your weakness in my hands.

289
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:54,650
But! Right now!

290
00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:58,120
I don't really need any money.

291
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:03,440
But to punch you because of that makes me think it'll just be my hand that's going to be in pain.

292
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:06,050
So?

293
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,490
Okay.

294
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:17,210
Let's think really carefully about this.

295
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:20,860
It's only one big hit. I can't be too hasty with it.

296
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:25,790
Oh, aren't you leaving? Any later and you won't make it before the curfew.

297
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:27,570
Let's go.

298
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:37,750
Big hit!

299
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:41,730
How did she come up with something like that?

300
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:46,390
Kim Bok Joo, you crazy...

301
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:51,820
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

302
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:54,770
Did you see Gi Seok now or on the way here?

303
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:59,680
- I didn't see him. Why? Did he say he'd kill me if he saw me?
- Yeah.

304
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,500
Oh yeah.

305
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:03,200
- And...
- There's more?

306
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,630
You were chosen for the rice-lifting portion.

307
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:08,390
At the sports competition, everyone hates the rice-sack lifting part.

308
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:12,070
No one voluntarily applied for it, so Bastard Gi Seok decided to pick you.

309
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:14,060
He said that you didn't come the meeting meant you'd do whatever is decided for you to—

310
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:16,260
Bastard, you should've stopped him!

311
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:20,170
W-What could I say!? With what!? Do I have strength?! Connections?!

312
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:23,650
How could I have stopped that bastard?

313
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:28,170
Just accept it, man. It isn't cool, but just close your eyes tight!

314
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:29,920
I don't care! I'm just going to ditch that day.

315
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,610
How can you deal with him afterwards?

316
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:34,770
It's not like he's going to think well of me if I do that event!

317
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:38,300
It's a hundred times better to get cussed at and do squat-walking afterward.

318
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:42,190
I'm going to ditch no matter what, so you just keep your mouth shut, got it?

319
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:44,840
I don't know! Do whatever you want!

320
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,600
What are you doing?

321
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,900
I-I got put in charge of something. Ch—

322
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:51,600
- What?!
- Ch-Ch...

323
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,350
Speak! Words! Speak words!

324
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:58,780
Cheerleader, cheerleader you bastard! Cheerleader!

325
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:20,580
Jeong Joon Hyeong, you also ran away yesterday, as usual.

326
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:24,270
So you're planning on doing squat-runs since it's exercise anyway, aren't you.

327
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:28,740
Something suddenly came up back at home.

328
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:33,020
Right. I don't need to give a punishment that makes you build muscles to please you.

329
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:36,580
Slowly, let me put you in the right spot on the swim team.

330
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:39,500
Do the floor cleaning.

331
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:48,950
Are you sure you'll be okay? If he gets upset,  you can't handle him.

332
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:52,300
I don't know. I'll think about it when it comes. My head hurts.

333
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:55,330
Hey, Cheerleader. Is it going well?

334
00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:58,800
It's whatever. I'm contemplating uniform colors.

335
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:03,650
Whether I decide a sun-beach color or a pretty purple color.

336
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:05,830
Ya! It seems like you're  really  enjoying this.

337
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:09,280
No, why would I enj— Of course, I'm enjoying this!

338
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:12,770
Ya, it's the first time in my life that I worried over something like this.

339
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:13,890
Really, this bastard.

340
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:16,180
Hey, look at this bastard.

341
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:18,310
Did your training go well?

342
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:23,930
I've been waiting for you to go eat pizza together. You like a brick-oven baked pizza

343
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:26,600
I know a place where they make really good ones.

344
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:30,220
Have a nice time!

345
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:32,020
Hey!

346
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:36,450
Why do you obstinately keep doing like this?

347
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:40,650
I try to do as much as I can. So you adapt yourself to this.

348
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:44,060
A relationship with people is different from exercising. Working hard won't just make things work out.

349
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:46,900
So I'm saying that I'll try and see whether or not it does work out.

350
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:49,980
After confirming that it's not possible, then  I  can give up.

351
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:54,010
I was fine without seeing you when I was in Taereung,

352
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:57,210
but now that I see you I can't give up.

353
00:24:57,270 --> 00:25:01,770
I can't hold onto anything but you.

354
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,680
Just think about standing up for yourself.

355
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:08,040
Everyone lives their own life.

356
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:12,630
There is no rope that you can hold onto.

357
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:17,060
I don't want to eat pizza with you anymore.

358
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:28,250
 Your hair! 

359
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:32,360
 Didn't I tell you to properly dry your hair before coming out? What are you going to do if you catch a cold? 

360
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:35,690
 And whose fault is that I'm in a rush like this? 

361
00:25:35,690 --> 00:25:37,560
 Let's go eat some pizza. 

362
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:40,060
 I want to watch you eat. 

363
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:43,870
 Then, I'll watch you watching me eat pizza. 

364
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:46,970
 What are you talking about? 

365
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:51,080
 Ah, really. Wait for me! 

366
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:04,270
Okay. I'll receive the punishment.

367
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:07,440
I'll take as much as you give me.

368
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,020
If only we could start again.

369
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:15,180
Finally, tomorrow we'll have the field day that we've looked forward to.

370
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:17,670
Yes!

371
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:20,780
What is our slogan?

372
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:24,280
Isn't it 'The Best Team Weightlifting Team'. Why are we  'The Best Team Weightlifting Team'?

373
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:27,580
Why is the field day truly the weightlifting team's day?

374
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:29,260
Let's show them this year as well!

375
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:31,380
- Yes. We understand!
 - Attention!

376
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:34,740
Professor! Why is the field day   the weightlifting team's day?

377
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:38,490
Ah, Yae Min, that's a good question. Since you're a freshman, you probably don't know it.

378
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:42,710
Since our school started a field day, with powerful endurance and mighty sinews,

379
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:47,180
our weightlifting team have never missed a first place.

380
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:51,620
Uh, if you went back to 1991 when I just entered college—
 Professor!

381
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:54,320
You told me you'd have the professors' meeting this afternoon.

382
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:58,460
Right. I'll tell you the story later. Then be dismissed!

383
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:00,030
Attention! Bow!

384
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:02,720
Thank you!

385
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:07,070
You'll be dead, huh?

386
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:13,820
I roughly heard Professor and Coach talking a while ago. Woon Gi will move up the weight division.

387
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:15,620
What do you mean? Why moving up the weight division all of a sudden?

388
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:20,740
That's a strategy. Since Woon Gi has power, if he increases his weight a little bit, he has a chance of winning in his new division.

389
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:23,330
And there is you in Woon Gi's  present weight division.

390
00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:28,850
Then I'm thankful if it happens. Then doesn't he practice at dawn for a pro team?

391
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:32,080
- I guess not. 
- Suddenly, I feel sorry for him.

392
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:08,000
Thanks.

393
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:12,950
Hey, why are you increasing your weight when your graduation is just around the corner?

394
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:16,200
Do you really want to give yourself the air of a team leader?

395
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:19,240
For me, I just want to test my limit.

396
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:23,710
Test your limit, my butt. You really hurt your body.

397
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:27,590
Hey, you overwork only for your sake.

398
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:31,710
Don't go over for our sakes. Think about your own self too.

399
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,700
I'm going.

400
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:41,010
- See you tomorrow!
 - Okay.

401
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:56,880
Joon Hyeong, do you want to just quit weight training and go out to play games for an hour?

402
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,810
That's okay.  I don't want to do that.

403
00:28:58,810 --> 00:29:03,410
Hey, let's go out and loosen our fingers a bit.

404
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:07,030
Then if you don't, I'll tell the little boss on you that you'll run away tomorrow.

405
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:08,920
Do what you want, you bastard.

406
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:13,010
Joon Hyeong!

407
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:24,170
Bad bastard.

408
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:35,080
 Did you eat well? I'm in the middle of individual practice. 
   

409
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:42,600
 In my life, there is no fun, but only hard work... 

410
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:47,040
Hey, are you okay?

411
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,100
Give me your hand.

412
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:55,980
You'd better stamp on your attendance sheet. (means he comes frequently.)

413
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:57,720
Did you do this on purpose because you missed me?

414
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:00,690
Oh no. I've been caught.

415
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:03,710
I think you got a message.

416
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:06,070
 Song Si Ho 

417
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:10,320
- That's okay. 
-  Must be a girl. 

418
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:13,540
Don't do too much. If you play hard to get, you'll really get hard to get.

419
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:16,870
Please don't worry about others, and think about your own love life.

420
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:18,450
What about me?

421
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:23,310
This is not the time to be so careless.  You should be nervous. My older brother is so popular these days.

422
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:26,610
Hey. Why would I be nervous when I'm just friends with him?

423
00:30:26,610 --> 00:30:29,810
But, what are you talking about? What do you mean by popularity explosion?

424
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:32,930
Does Jae Yi really have a girl?

425
00:30:32,930 --> 00:30:34,920
Even though you're only friends, I guess you're still worried.

426
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:38,720
Hey, this isn't being worried. I'm just curious.

427
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,250
Instead of being like this, you should slowly start turning on your headlights.

428
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:44,890
If you hesitate too much, there's a chance you won't be able to change traffic lanes.

429
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:49,120
So, I guess Jeong Jae Yi really does have someone.

430
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:52,930
By any chance, is it that pretty model that comes to get treatment?

431
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:56,360
Who's the model?

432
00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:07,540
You're exercising diligently.

433
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:12,270
I felt as if I was lacking a-abdominal strength these days.

434
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:16,300
Yeah, it's nice to see you work hard.

435
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:21,370
By any chance,

436
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:24,190
did you see Joon Hyeong today?

437
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:27,890
No. Um, Unni, I'm sorry

438
00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:31,290
but for the time being, please don't talk about him in front of me.

439
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:34,840
I'm having a difficult time because of him these days.

440
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:37,340
What's difficult?

441
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:41,930
There's just something uncomfortable. Please don't ask anything else.

442
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:02,450
  Infirmary  

443
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:04,150
Hello! Ain't I pretty?

444
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:07,000
- Yeah, you're pretty.
 - I'm the Field Day Queen today!

445
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,040
Yeah, leave now.

446
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:16,110
 Rhythmic Gymnastics Club  

447
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:26,690
  Weightlifting Club 

448
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:29,490
That suits you well. You're pretty.

449
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:32,350
You flatter me, Ms. Song.

450
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:35,160
- Where's Joon Hyeong?
 - Ah, Joon Hyeong?

451
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:38,420
This is supposed to be a secret, but that bastard ditched

452
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:40,430
because he didn't want to lift the rice sacks.

453
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:42,090
Where did he go?

454
00:32:47,770 --> 00:32:51,660
♬   Will you be spinning in delight?   ♬

455
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:56,440
♬   I think you're so pretty   ♬

456
00:32:56,440 --> 00:33:01,430
♬   but we shouldn't do this   ♬

457
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:07,430
♬   Following the rain and the rainbow, ♬ 

458
00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:13,290
♬   in our personal heaven, we are staring to search for wonderful days   ♬

459
00:33:13,290 --> 00:33:15,830
♬   When it gets hard,   ♬

460
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:20,130
♬   who cares if we take a step back and give up?   ♬

461
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:24,170
♬   we'll just run forward two steps tomorrow   ♬

462
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,520
  Weightlifting Team!  

463
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:39,910
You chopsticks are dead today.

464
00:33:39,910 --> 00:33:43,940
I'll pop all of you blobs.

465
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:46,870
I'll only target one person.

466
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:50,800
 Get ready, start! 

467
00:34:21,010 --> 00:34:25,520
 Swimming Club 

468
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,960
- That's awesome, seriously!
 - Really?

469
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:30,560
Kids, the rice-sack lifting competition is next.

470
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:33,140
Who's set to compete? Come out.

471
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:38,480
Jeong Joon Hyeong. Jeong Joon Hyeong!

472
00:34:40,270 --> 00:34:44,350
Jo Tae Gwon, where did that bastard, Jeong Joon Hyeong, ditch to this time?

473
00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:48,710
Ah, I'm not sure. He was here a minute ago. Where did he...  Did he go to take a dump?

474
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:51,780
Are you kidding me, you bastard? Find him immediately and bring him here.

475
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:53,440
Now!

476
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:56,630
Are you playing games?

477
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:58,250
What?

478
00:34:58,250 --> 00:34:59,990
Your whereabouts are obvious.

479
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:04,030
If you're not at the swimming pool, you're either on the basketball court or in the PC room.

480
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:07,410
Field Day doesn't match my preferences either.

481
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:11,380
I didn't know you had detective skills too.

482
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:13,850
I guess you were really busy yesterday.

483
00:35:13,850 --> 00:35:16,010
You didn't even read my messages.

484
00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:19,130
No, I wasn't busy. I just didn't read them.

485
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:26,290
  Tae Gwon 

486
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:34,520
Pick up, you mean bastard. Have I ever wronged you this much? Huh?

487
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:38,910
Where am I supposed to find someone who ran away, with a plan?

488
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:42,810
You think I'm a pushover, don't you, Bastard Gi Seok?

489
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:47,270
Oh, you were scared. Sorry, I was just too hot.

490
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:50,200
Classmate, by any chance, have you seen Joon Hyeong?

491
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:52,520
No, I haven't seen him today. Why do you ask?

492
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:55,730
No, no, it's nothing. Please take care on your way back.

493
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:02,970
- Yes, senior?
 -&lt; i&gt;Why aren't you coming?!

494
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:05,240
Didn't you find that bastard, Joon Hyeong, yet?!

495
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:10,240
Ah, no. You see, I'm looking for him right now but I don't think he's on the school campus—
 - Do you both want to die?!

496
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,050
You have five minutes to find him.

497
00:36:12,050 --> 00:36:17,310
Whether you drag him or carry him, bring him here. If he flakes, both of you will die.

498
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:22,040
S-Senior? Senior, senior, senior? Senior? Se-bastard!

499
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:26,980
Hey, I'm not Jeong Joon Hyeong's plus-one. Why are you always so obsessed with picking on me too?

500
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:29,440
Was I the one that ditched? Did I ditch? Did I?!

501
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:33,140
Um, did Jeong Joon Hyeong cause an accident or something?

502
00:36:33,830 --> 00:36:37,470
This all-grown kid, he doesn't want to lift the rice-sacks so he ditched.

503
00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:42,340
But based on the situation right now, I don't think this will just end with punishment. At the very least, it's death.

504
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:45,880
There's an old saying, "If you meet a wrong partner, your life will be ruined."

505
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:48,740
Ah, I agree with those words ten times.

506
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:52,870
I shouldn't have become friends with this bastard from the start, ugh!

507
00:36:52,870 --> 00:36:56,740
Um, so if Jeong Joon Hyeong

508
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:59,300
doesn't compete in the rice-sack lifting competition,

509
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:04,140
he's in danger of being killed by his senior. Is that right?

510
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:06,200
Yes.

511
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:23,390
Aish, this bastard. He should call in moderation.

512
00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:25,180
What now?!

513
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:27,280
Thankfully, you picked up. It's me.

514
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,940
Who?

515
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:33,180
Kim Bok Joo?

516
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:38,850
I got your number from your friend because I think today is D-day.

517
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:41,910
What are you talking about? The D-day for what?

518
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:45,500
That one chance we talked about before. I'm going to use it today.

519
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:49,080
- What?
 - From now on, listen to me carefully.

520
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:51,810
I'll save your life today.

521
00:37:51,810 --> 00:37:55,090
In return, from now on, don't   ever 

522
00:37:55,090 --> 00:37:58,420
play with my weakness.

523
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:01,190
I'll take it that you promised.

524
00:38:02,850 --> 00:38:07,310
Hey, hey, hey, Fatty! Kim Bok Joo! Kim Bok Joo, hey!

525
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:11,350
- Kim Bok Joo? What's going on?
 -  The person you are trying to reach is not available at— 

526
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:16,640
Jeong Joon Hyeong! Where are you going?

527
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:20,440
Is this a disease? My body is itching in front of those rice sacks.

528
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:24,490
Hey, kids, I guess Hyeong Cheol is hungry after seeing all that rice.

529
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:31,140
It's too bad. If our weightlifting club is able to participate in this game,  we'll win as a matter of course.

530
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:34,410
No, that's not fair.

531
00:38:34,410 --> 00:38:37,530
Then if the track and field team compete in the track, hurdles, and jumping,

532
00:38:37,530 --> 00:38:40,500
it'll be completely a talent show, not a field day.

533
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:43,450
That's true,  but anyway...  If the judo club can just

534
00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:46,150
suppress the swimming club in this,

535
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:48,380
our win is certain.

536
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:50,840
Don't worry. There's no way that the

537
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:53,320
judo team would lose to the swimming team in strength.

538
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,520
 - Let's go, swimming team!
 - You can do it! 

539
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:10,450
Swimming Club, please send your competitor out now.

540
00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:13,940
Swimming Club? Are you forfeiting?

541
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:17,250
Hey, anyone who thinks you're strong enough, come out instead of him!

542
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:22,610
We're here! We're here! Here, here! Here!

543
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:27,580
That... I'm sorry, but the athlete that was supposed to compete isn't feeling well.

544
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:31,950
Instead, can I request that we use a mercenary?

545
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:35,740
Hey, what bullsh*t are you saying? Where is Jeong Joon Hyeong, that bastard?

546
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:40,080
Senior, I couldn't find him. Shouldn't we discuss this later, after we win?

547
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:43,120
- Hey, hold him. Hold him!
 - Aish!

548
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:48,910
This is our swimming club's mercenary for rice sack lifting!

549
00:40:17,010 --> 00:40:22,600
Now, this is the athlete who will compete in place of our swimming club's Jeong Joon Hyeong,

550
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,600
OUR MERCENARY!

551
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,510
What are you doing, Bok Joo?! You crazy wench, aren't you going to come back here right now?!

552
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:28,680
- You crazy wench!
-   A big round of applause!  

553
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:33,060
- What is she doing right now?!
 - That pyscho, seriously!

554
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:35,130
Did you know she was going to compete for them?

555
00:40:35,130 --> 00:40:39,510
Since we're running late, we'll accept that mercenary or whoever.

556
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:42,690
 Track and field, judo, taekwondo, swim, rhythmic gymnastics 

557
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:48,740
Now, for the first stage, we'll start off lightly with 40 kg.

558
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:51,250
Of course, she can lift that with one hand.

559
00:40:51,250 --> 00:40:53,910
Is it okay  we just watch her doing?

560
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:56,160
- Ugh!
 - Okay, okay, okay!

561
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,740
 Swim Team 
Rhythmic Gymnastics Team 

562
00:40:57,740 --> 00:41:02,860
There is no word.

563
00:41:04,450 --> 00:41:07,480
Now, four sacks. Start!
  Judo Team - Swim Team 

564
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:14,780
Kim Bok Joo! Kim Bok Joo! Kim Bok Joo!
  Swim Team 

565
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:19,790
Kim Bok Joo! Kim Bok Joo! Kim Bok Joo! Kim Bok Joo!

566
00:41:19,790 --> 00:41:24,500
Kim Bok Joo! Kim Bok Joo! Kim Bok Joo!

567
00:41:28,330 --> 00:41:32,140
Now, the last round, five sacks. Start!

568
00:41:41,890 --> 00:41:44,800
 Kim Bok Joo! Kim Bok Joo! 

569
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:49,960
 Kim Bok Joo! Kim Bok Joo! Kim Bok Joo! 

570
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:54,040
- Judo team, fighting!
 - Kim Bok Joo! Kim Bok Joo!

571
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:08,300
- They're first place because of you!
 - Come on!

572
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:10,900
Hey! Kim Bok Joo!

573
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:14,070
 - Kim Bok Joo! 
 - Hey, Kim Bok Joo! 

574
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,690
We could've placed the first but second place...

575
00:42:16,690 --> 00:42:19,130
What should we do?

576
00:42:19,130 --> 00:42:21,470
We just placed second.

577
00:42:21,470 --> 00:42:23,750
You all worked hard.

578
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:28,380
It is refreshing to win the second place.  Of course,

579
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:31,280
we can't win every time.

580
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:38,200
That we depended on the tug of war with the judo team for first place is a matter of celebrating ourselves.

581
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:45,540
Of course, it's very pitiful that the best weightlifting team's reputation was broken in my time...

582
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:53,750
It's not even two points. We would have tied with just a single point.

583
00:42:55,250 --> 00:43:01,810
Still, the process is more important than the result.

584
00:43:01,810 --> 00:43:06,720
If you all had fun, it's okay. Eat up. Eat, eat.

585
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,190
Professor, are you not going to eat?

586
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:12,070
No. I don't have an appetite right now, so I won't eat!

587
00:43:13,670 --> 00:43:17,200
Ah, um... All of you, eat up and rest.

588
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:19,370
Yeah, do that.

589
00:43:24,230 --> 00:43:26,340
Anyway, you all worked hard today.

590
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:28,480
Go back to your dorms and massage yourselves.

591
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,620
Don't call me.

592
00:43:32,170 --> 00:43:34,240
 Kim Bok Joo... 

593
00:43:37,130 --> 00:43:41,200
Is he telling us to eat or not? This isn't even that big of a deal. What's wrong with him?

594
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,740
Hey, it's a waste. We lost by a single point.

595
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:46,590
That's what I'm saying. You should've run faster.

596
00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:50,130
We would have gotten five points if you had just placed  third.

597
00:43:50,930 --> 00:43:53,960
You can't throw the blame on me!

598
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:58,410
Even if it was not a mercenary or something, that traitor...

599
00:43:58,410 --> 00:44:00,370
The swimming club wouldn't have even dreamed about winning.

600
00:44:00,370 --> 00:44:03,270
Well, Kim Bok Joo.

601
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:07,520
With exactly what thought did you do such an outrageous thing?

602
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,680
I didn't know the results would turn out like this, I'm sorry.

603
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:12,170
If you knew, you're not normal. You would be a psycho.

604
00:44:12,170 --> 00:44:14,250
Hey, don't eat the hamburger.

605
00:44:14,250 --> 00:44:16,820
Go to the swimming club president and ask him for yours. Don't eat that one!

606
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:20,030
Come on, stop it. It's already happened. There's nothing we can do about it now.

607
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:24,060
Bok Joo, when everyone finishes eating, clean everything up and come out.

608
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:25,950
You should at least do that much.

609
00:44:25,950 --> 00:44:28,020
Wow, how weak.

610
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:30,970
For a punishment dealt to a traitor, that's weak.

611
00:44:30,970 --> 00:44:32,960
You do all sorts of things. Ugh!

612
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:37,500
Really, I should squeeze you.

613
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:40,070
Ugh, I should just...

614
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:50,740
Hey, I'm sorry. Even if I had ten mouths, I would have nothing to say.

615
00:44:50,740 --> 00:44:54,780
You. You like Jeong Joon Hyeong, don't you? That's it, right?

616
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:57,940
Hey, it's not something like that!

617
00:44:57,940 --> 00:45:01,930
Don't lie, you wench. You might deceive a ghost but you can't deceive me.

618
00:45:01,930 --> 00:45:04,840
If that isn't the case, then this situation isn't understandable.

619
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:07,430
Mercenary? What bullsh*t.

620
00:45:07,430 --> 00:45:11,190
Hey, what do you lack that you would become the swimming club's mercenary?

621
00:45:11,190 --> 00:45:16,510
Because you like him, you lifted those rice sacks up without thinking of the consequences.

622
00:45:16,510 --> 00:45:19,320
I thought you acted strangely from the cafeteria.

623
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:21,110
Hey, Kim Bok Joo, is that really the case?

624
00:45:21,110 --> 00:45:23,390
It's not like that!

625
00:45:23,390 --> 00:45:25,850
I can't even flip my body inside out and show you how I feel on the inside. I'm going insane—

626
00:45:25,850 --> 00:45:30,380
Who's the one going insane here? Then at least explain so we can understand, in a way we can understand.

627
00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:33,020
Hah, no. No.

628
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:35,330
She's right. It's obvious when I look at you that she's right.

629
00:45:35,330 --> 00:45:37,480
No matter how much you like a man, this isn't right.

630
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:40,170
How can you abandon your team because of a man?

631
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:45,620
I... He... Anyway, that's not true!

632
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:48,100
Hey, even if she said she would do it, you should have stopped her!

633
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:50,340
What mercenary?! How could you tell her to do something so ridiculous?!

634
00:45:50,340 --> 00:45:53,650
She said she had something to pay off towards you. Her will to call it even with this was so strong

635
00:45:53,650 --> 00:45:55,140
that I didn't have a choice. I'm being serious.

636
00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:57,510
Shut up, you bastard. Then what does she become?

637
00:45:57,510 --> 00:45:59,800
In the end, the weightlifting department didn't win because of her.

638
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:01,580
She's become a world traitor right now.

639
00:46:01,580 --> 00:46:04,540
At a friendly sports game, becoming a world traitor. Don't talk nonsense!

640
00:46:04,540 --> 00:46:06,420
That's just the comparison! I should just—

641
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:07,980
Oh!

642
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:10,880
Hey! It's not like that.

643
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:12,970
We said we got it.

644
00:46:12,970 --> 00:46:16,280
Never mind, we already figured it out.

645
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:23,430
It's not! It's not! I'm telling you it's not like that.

646
00:46:24,230 --> 00:46:25,990
We need to talk.

647
00:46:25,990 --> 00:46:27,640
- Alright, let go of me!
 - Hey, hey, Bok Joo!

648
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:30,980
Alright, let's talk after you let go of me! Let go!

649
00:46:30,980 --> 00:46:37,100
Aish! Wait, why is that bastard taking our Bok Joo? Where is he taking her?! Huh?!

650
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:39,360
There's trouble.

651
00:46:41,070 --> 00:46:43,520
What do you want?! What?

652
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:45,320
Just what in the world were you thinking when you did that?

653
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:48,000
I told you over the phone, let's call it even with this.

654
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,390
I don't want to worry about whether you'll expose my secret or not,

655
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:54,040
and I don't want to be teased anymore either. What? Do I have to explain more?

656
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:58,190
If you expose my secret even after I did all this, you're not even human.

657
00:46:58,190 --> 00:47:02,140
From now on, regardless of the circumstances, you have to shut up. Keep my secret.

658
00:47:02,140 --> 00:47:04,150
Exactly what do you see me as?

659
00:47:04,150 --> 00:47:06,660
No matter how thoughtless I am,

660
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:08,920
do I seem like someone who would expose a secret like that to your own team?

661
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:11,060
That's not what I mean.

662
00:47:11,060 --> 00:47:13,230
You might tell the doctor.

663
00:47:14,690 --> 00:47:17,630
He's your older brother. What if you tell him?

664
00:47:18,790 --> 00:47:21,850
I don't want to be seen as a lying student.

665
00:47:21,850 --> 00:47:24,970
So please don't tell him, Joon Hyeong. Please.

666
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:28,290
Do you like my older brother that much?

667
00:47:32,420 --> 00:47:34,190
What about him? Exactly how much do you like him that—

668
00:47:34,190 --> 00:47:37,950
Yeah, I like him! What about it? Am I not allowed to like a man that much?

669
00:47:37,950 --> 00:47:40,380
I'm not even asking him to like me back. All I'm going to do is like him.

670
00:47:40,380 --> 00:47:43,740
All I'm going to do is just go see him. Am I not allowed to do that?!

671
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:47,980
I'm sorry that out of all people, I had to like your older brother.

672
00:47:57,180 --> 00:47:58,920
What do you think?

673
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:02,320
It's true that our Bok Joo likes your friend, right?

674
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:05,930
Well, it seems like it, but it doesn't...

675
00:48:05,930 --> 00:48:07,810
So are you saying they like each other or not?

676
00:48:07,810 --> 00:48:12,060
That's what I'm saying... I'm lacking in voicing my conviction.

677
00:48:12,060 --> 00:48:17,430
Oh! Now that I think about, we've met a few times but I don't think I've ever officially introduced myself.

678
00:48:17,430 --> 00:48:20,330
I'm Jo Tae Gwon from the swimming department.

679
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:24,970
I'm Jeong Nan Hee from weightlifting department.

680
00:48:25,590 --> 00:48:27,850
Nice to meet you, I'm Lee Soon Ok.

681
00:48:27,850 --> 00:48:31,130
Wow, it's an honor to meet both of you. To be close friends with such girl crushes—

682
00:48:31,130 --> 00:48:35,920
Ah, of course, even though we meet each other because  of my not-good-enough friend,

683
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:38,270
it feels really good.

684
00:48:38,270 --> 00:48:42,720
Well, we don't have any bad feelings towards you either.

685
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:44,840
Your friend is the problem.

686
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:47,810
No matter how much I think about it, I think he's playing with our Bok Joo's feelings.

687
00:48:47,810 --> 00:48:49,800
He's not even going to date her, yet he's giving her false hope.

688
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:53,560
You're right. He somehow has that kind of part.

689
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:57,520
I can't tell if it's confidence or arrogance, but he has the ability to toy with people's emotions.

690
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:01,830
I'm worried he'll become inhumane, so I advised him not to do that so many times,

691
00:49:01,830 --> 00:49:03,840
but that bastard won't even listen.

692
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:09,420
But anyway, I'll be sure to act accordingly so no problems arise in the future.

693
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:13,620
Of course. Anyway, at least you seem to understand us.

694
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:16,470
This is uncomfortable. We're all the same age here, can't we drop the honorifics?

695
00:49:16,470 --> 00:49:20,090
Please drop it, drop it! Do as you wish. I'm fine with anything!

696
00:49:20,090 --> 00:49:21,360
Yeah, Tae Gwon.

697
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:23,150
Yeah, N-Nan Ok!

698
00:49:23,150 --> 00:49:24,930
I'm Nan Hee and she's Soon Ok.

699
00:49:24,930 --> 00:49:26,780
Let's go!

700
00:49:26,780 --> 00:49:29,130
Hey, what? Did you get dumped?

701
00:49:30,890 --> 00:49:32,770
Bok Joo!

702
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:39,700
Oh, hey. Mommy... I was so nervous.

703
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:43,100
Why are they so scary? Why did you come so late? Hey,

704
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:45,180
my legs...

705
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:57,020
Drink it up. Drink and forget everything.

706
00:49:57,020 --> 00:50:00,700
Yeah, it's not good if a man's face is too perfect. It'll make the girl nervous.

707
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:03,250
Hey, stop it now. I told you it wasn't anything like that.

708
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:06,950
Yeah, what's the use of digging into something from the past?

709
00:50:06,950 --> 00:50:08,670
Just forget it!

710
00:50:08,670 --> 00:50:13,360
Yeah, just think whatever you want. What's important about that?

711
00:50:14,870 --> 00:50:18,480
Hey, I'll introduce you to a man. A truckful of men.

712
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:20,450
How about him? Rowing team.

713
00:50:20,450 --> 00:50:24,220
He's someone I called dibs on, but if you like him, I'll concede.

714
00:50:25,410 --> 00:50:27,070
Or what about Tae Gwon?

715
00:50:27,070 --> 00:50:30,240
What about his friend? He looked much easier than Jeong Joon Hyeong.

716
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:32,800
Hey, Bok Joo has preferences too. You can't match her up with just anyone.

717
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:34,980
What do you mean anyone?

718
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:39,910
He looks cute, docile, refreshing, and sweet like a caramel.

719
00:50:39,910 --> 00:50:44,640
Of course. Who didn't you  dislike? You keep them all.

720
00:50:45,310 --> 00:50:47,720
I really miss him.

721
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:49,730
Hey, Bok Joo!

722
00:50:49,730 --> 00:50:52,750
She's so pitiful, what to do?

723
00:50:53,630 --> 00:50:57,810
I  really  miss you.

724
00:50:59,850 --> 00:51:05,850
I  really  miss you.

725
00:51:05,850 --> 00:51:08,290
♬  Dreaming    ♬

726
00:51:08,290 --> 00:51:11,020
I  really  miss you.

727
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:18,490
♬   I'm dreaming of everlasting happiness   ♬

728
00:51:33,830 --> 00:51:36,630
You know...

729
00:51:36,630 --> 00:51:40,540
- Can I ask you one thing?
 - Yes?

730
00:51:40,540 --> 00:51:41,630
What is it?

731
00:51:41,630 --> 00:51:48,160
About yesterday, why did you do it—take Joon Hyeong's place during the rice lifting contest?

732
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:50,570
Oh that...

733
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:55,490
I hope you'll understand that there were some circumstances.

734
00:51:55,490 --> 00:51:59,610
Anything more than that is invading my privacy, sorry.

735
00:52:00,580 --> 00:52:05,030
Really? It seems you have a lot of secrets too.

736
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:15,620
  I gave my older brother a present as well: the seat next to you. 

737
00:52:15,620 --> 00:52:18,660
 Go and act like it's a coincidence. It's a gift. 

738
00:52:37,860 --> 00:52:42,830
Hey, Athlete Kim. Why are you so shy? You love this. This one is properly spread.

739
00:52:42,830 --> 00:52:44,480
Hey, eat this.

740
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:47,040
Delicious. It's so delicious.

741
00:52:48,100 --> 00:52:50,570
It is delicious.

742
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:52,890
It was so fun— Oh my!

743
00:52:52,890 --> 00:52:56,950
Geez! This rest area looks like a marketplace.

744
00:52:56,950 --> 00:53:00,270
Only ahjummas are slouched around happily.

745
00:53:00,270 --> 00:53:02,690
That's right. What are they going to do?

746
00:53:02,690 --> 00:53:06,740
Whether someone digs into some bread a gayageum, what's it to you?

747
00:53:06,740 --> 00:53:08,970
Hey, hey, just pity them.

748
00:53:08,970 --> 00:53:13,540
One of three desires of humans is eating food. They live a life giving up that desire.

749
00:53:13,540 --> 00:53:19,190
Yeah, since you all give something up too, we'll call that even. Isn't that right, nuns?

750
00:53:19,220 --> 00:53:22,280
- Ugly. 
 - How holy!

751
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:24,680
- Ugh, I should just!
 - Oh! You scared me!

752
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:28,640
- Fine, we'll leave. 
 - What's wrong with them?

753
00:53:29,170 --> 00:53:32,620
As expected, when you can't talk it out, you have to use your fists.

754
00:53:33,570 --> 00:53:37,410
  Should I go? Should I not go? 

755
00:53:37,410 --> 00:53:39,540
  Seriously, should I go? 

756
00:53:40,740 --> 00:53:44,900
  No matter how much I think about it, I think he's going to think something is strange if I have the seat right next to him. 

757
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:51,270
  I don't even have any clothes to wear to a performance like that either. Yeah, let's not go. 

758
00:53:52,570 --> 00:53:56,700
Jeong Joon Hyeong and Jo Tae Gwon.

759
00:53:56,740 --> 00:54:00,280
The sound of the mop scrubbing the floor is weak.

760
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:04,490
What? Is having to clean with the freshmen hurting your pride?

761
00:54:05,250 --> 00:54:07,780
- Then do you two just want to do it by yourselves?!
 - No!

762
00:54:07,780 --> 00:54:09,710
We'll work hard!

763
00:54:09,710 --> 00:54:12,120
Yeah, work hard.

764
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:14,520
Yes!

765
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:23,900
My arms! Still, the punishment was lighter than what I expected.

766
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:26,980
Wow. If we hadn't won, we would be in hell right now.

767
00:54:26,980 --> 00:54:30,810
- Hey, this is all thanks to your mercenary friend.
 - So, are you happy? Huh?

768
00:54:30,810 --> 00:54:33,740
Of course! I'm so happy!

769
00:54:33,750 --> 00:54:36,660
Hey, but does that mercenary really like you?

770
00:54:36,670 --> 00:54:38,860
That's what her friends think.

771
00:54:38,860 --> 00:54:42,330
They predicted wrong. Our mercenary has someone else.

772
00:54:42,330 --> 00:54:44,360
Really?

773
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:50,920
Wow, wow. Speak of the devil. Look who's here.

774
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:53,900
Oh? I don't see our mercenary.

775
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:58,570
Right now, our mercenary is very busy playing the elegant.

776
00:55:11,450 --> 00:55:14,060
Oh, Doctor!

777
00:55:15,220 --> 00:55:17,920
Oh! Ms. Bok Joo.

778
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:20,250
Did you come to see this performance too?

779
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:24,350
Ah, yes. H-How did— I came because Joon Hyeong gave me a ticket.

780
00:55:24,350 --> 00:55:27,780
Oh. This is a performance I've wanted to see since long ago.

781
00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:31,620
How can our seats even be next to each other? If someone saw this, they would think this was planned out. Haha...

782
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:37,570
I know, right? Wow, you look like a completely different person. I can't recognize you.

783
00:55:37,590 --> 00:55:40,410
Well, it's a bit uncomfortable,

784
00:55:40,410 --> 00:55:43,930
but people have to behave and dress accordingly for the time and place, so...

785
00:55:43,930 --> 00:55:46,380
Please sit down.

786
00:55:52,130 --> 00:55:55,460
- Did you see this?
 - Thank you.

787
00:56:09,850 --> 00:56:13,060
Bok Joo, you do something like that, right?

788
00:56:24,780 --> 00:56:28,530
How was it? It was much better than I thought it would be.

789
00:56:28,530 --> 00:56:31,830
A string ensemble is fantastic.

790
00:56:31,830 --> 00:56:34,200
Since you major in the cello, it would have been even more amazing for you.

791
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:39,360
Ah, of course. They were   really   good.

792
00:56:39,390 --> 00:56:42,070
Ah, let's go to my car. I'll give you a ride.

793
00:56:42,070 --> 00:56:50,310
I'm fine. Then, I'll be indebted towards you, Doctor. It'll take quite a while to walk all the way to the bus station.

794
00:56:53,870 --> 00:56:55,970
 Coach. 

795
00:57:07,550 --> 00:57:12,890
Ah, this is taking longer than I thought it would. I'm sorry.

796
00:57:12,890 --> 00:57:17,870
No, it's nic— I mean, it's fine.

797
00:57:23,060 --> 00:57:26,610
Oh! It's raining.

798
00:57:27,980 --> 00:57:33,160
Now that I think about, strangely,  it always rains whenever I'm with you.

799
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:36,960
I know. Do I lead a rain cloud around?

800
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:40,150
No, it's the opposite.

801
00:57:40,150 --> 00:57:44,000
You're the type to lead the sun.

802
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:46,870
No, that's not true. What sun?

803
00:57:49,230 --> 00:57:51,810
Excuse me, Doctor.

804
00:57:51,810 --> 00:57:55,690
Can't you just drop honorifics with me? You're much older than me.

805
00:57:55,690 --> 00:58:02,360
Come on, you're still my patient. I need to differentiate between my professional and personal life.

806
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:05,840
P-Patient...

807
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:13,170
N-No, I didn't mean "patient" in that sense. Please don't misunderstand.

808
00:58:16,310 --> 00:58:21,030
Doctor, you're unexpectedly cute. Ah, I'm sorry. I was rude, wasn't I?

809
00:58:21,030 --> 00:58:24,580
No, it was nice.

810
00:58:24,580 --> 00:58:28,580
It was the first time I heard I was cute since I was born.

811
00:58:30,310 --> 00:58:33,510
  Good job. 

812
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:40,150
 On the day of carrying a vanity table, I did a good job of passing that path. 

813
00:58:40,150 --> 00:58:45,230
  You did well in not taking an umbrella when it was raining. 

814
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:50,810
  You did well in choosing to run towards him instead of giving up. 

815
00:58:51,700 --> 00:58:57,600
  You did really well in being born a girl, Kim Bok Joo. 

816
00:58:57,640 --> 00:58:59,500
