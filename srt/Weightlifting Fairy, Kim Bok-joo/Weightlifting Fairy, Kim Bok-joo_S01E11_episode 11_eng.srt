1
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:31,310
I gave them an appropriate excuse.

2
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:34,860
I told them that due to nervousness from the competition, she became sick.

3
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:36,610
Yes.

4
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:39,960
We decided to set another date for the meeting.

5
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,740
Really? Goodness, I'm making you do so much work. I'm sorry.

6
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:46,740
No, it's nothing.

7
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:51,230
I think she left because she was upset over Coach Choi.

8
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:55,340
The kids are looking for her right now so once we find her, I'll call you immediately.

9
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:56,930
Alright.

10
00:00:56,930 --> 00:01:00,060
I'll continue to look for her too, thank you.

11
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,910
Did they postpone the meeting?

12
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:05,080
Ah, this wench. Where is she wandering around?

13
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:09,090
Just wait until she gets home, I'll just—

14
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,360
Hey, Kim Bok Joo!

15
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,420
You wench!

16
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:15,190
Where are you coming back from? Huh?

17
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:16,740
Do you know how much we searched for you?!

18
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:20,330
Call your professor first, quickly!

19
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,410
Father...

20
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:29,620
Father, I don't like weightlifting.

21
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:32,110
I don't want to weight-lift, Father.

22
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:37,810
W-What is s-she saying right now? Y-You don't want to do what?

23
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:41,530
She said she doesn't like w-weightlifting.

24
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:46,420
What are you saying out of the blue?! Speak in a way I can understand!

25
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:49,000
Father, you know, I...

26
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,130
No matter what anyone said, even if people ridiculed me for being a female weightlifter,

27
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:57,910
I liked weightlifting.

28
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:01,560
I liked the foul-smell of the metal on the barbell

29
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,780
and I liked the powder-filled air of the weightlifting room.

30
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:08,570
Weightlifting was really fun, it made me happy.

31
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:11,320
But I don't like it anymore.

32
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,800
I hate weightlifting so much.

33
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,690
I'm not happy at all.

34
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:21,420
I don't want to weight-lift.

35
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:25,990
I don't want to do anything anymore. What do I do, Father?

36
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,880
She's so pitiful...

37
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:44,750
Hey! Seriously, where have you been?

38
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:07,690
Why do you have so many secrets these days?

39
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:11,500
By any chance, are you secretly dating someone?

40
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:26,020
 Croak, croak, croak, croak, croak... 

41
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:26,860
  What is that? 

42
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:28,760
  Here, a toad. 

43
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,270
  You never know, that might become your good-luck charm. 

44
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:25,910
  I guess that friend, Bok Joo, is a very special friend. 

45
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:27,540
Tch...

46
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:33,180
Why aren't you saying anything? Are you really dating?

47
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:35,500
You're not, right?

48
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,050
I guess I am.

49
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:38,620
What?

50
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:41,000
I guess I'm dating...

51
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:43,760
by myself.

52
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:09,390
  Episode 11: It's the end; It's not the end. 

53
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:20,390
Wow! In this beef-radish soup, there are

54
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:22,850
one, two...

55
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:26,680
There are only two pieces of beef. Wow, that's really amazing.

56
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:32,070
But in Bok Joo's soup, two, four, six, eight.

57
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:33,760
Is hers braised short ribs?

58
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:37,360
Wow, my older brother is really honest.

59
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:42,280
You discriminate between us out in the open. You're not sneaky at all. I just love it so much.

60
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:46,910
Where are you going?

61
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:56,460
Now, where are you going?

62
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:02,330
Ah, why is the mood in this house so dark?

63
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:05,200
It's suffocating.

64
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:12,470
  Haneul Sports University 

65
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:23,850
After starting weightlifting, she's never complained about how difficult it is.

66
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:30,030
Seeing her cry from how miserable she is, I don't think those were empty words.

67
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:32,460
I think she's in a slump.

68
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:37,040
I'm sure you know this too; athletes occasionally fall into a slump.

69
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:41,510
She must also feel empty as the competition she trained so hard for with increasing weight has just ended

70
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:45,230
and Coach Choi, who she used to follow, just left.

71
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:48,020
What do you think we should do, Professor Yoon?

72
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:12,240
I was planning to go to school now.

73
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,770
Go to your dorm and pack your bags.

74
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:17,930
Pack lightly, just the things you need.

75
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,130
What are you talking about? A vacation?

76
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:29,960
This somehow happened. The professor also said this would be good.

77
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:36,940
Here, these are new. I'll give these to you before I leave.

78
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:39,510
Bok Joo, are you sick somewhere?

79
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:43,940
Tell us, why are you taking a vacation?

80
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:47,590
Yesterday, you suddenly disappeared and made everyone worry.

81
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:50,460
What's wrong with you, seriously?!

82
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:56,140
Kids, I need some time to think.

83
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:57,960
Time to think about what?

84
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:08,220
Why do I weight-lift? What meaning does weightlifting hold in my life?

85
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:11,470
Am I doing this because I really want to?

86
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:14,400
Why are you thinking about that now?

87
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:19,190
So after you think about it and decide that it isn't right for you, you're going to quit? Is that it?

88
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:21,890
Kim Bok Joo, you're seriously a traitor.

89
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:25,960
How could you do this without even discussing a word of it with us?

90
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:32,670
Let's just send her off for now. She's not leaving for good, she's just taking a short break.

91
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:35,330
Still, I don't like it.

92
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:40,230
The coach left and Bok Joo is leaving too. Why is everyone leaving?!

93
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,520
I'm sorry, Nan Hee.

94
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,770
I'm sorry, Soon Ok.

95
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:57,580
Are you going somewhere?

96
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:23,430
Yes, Fatty? Hey, are you okay?

97
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:26,430
No, I'm not fine.

98
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:30,320
Jeong Joon Hyeong, I've just finished packing my bags and I'm leaving now.

99
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,820
What?

100
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,890
I'm going to take a break from the winter training.

101
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:38,760
  Still, I thought I should at least tell you before I leave. 

102
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:43,260
Thank you for everything. Good luck on your training.

103
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:46,360
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, Kim Bok Joo! Hey!

104
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:55,340
  The person you are trying to contact is not available at the moment-- 

105
00:09:57,450 --> 00:09:58,470
Yes.

106
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:02,660
I thought I should at least tell you, Sunbae.

107
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:07,560
I'm sorry, I'll tell you everything later.

  Why are you going on vacation although it's not vacation season? 

115
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:22,770
  Wow, I want to go on vacation too.

Ah, I caught you again.

125
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:21,580
Hey, I guess I'm a natural Kim Bok Joo hunter.

126
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:23,480
Oh, Jeong Joon Hyeong.

127
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:29,350
What is this? Fish-shaped bread? Hey, get on.

128
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:43,930
You went all the way to the intersection to buy this?

129
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:46,910
My dad really likes the fish-shaped bread from there.

130
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:52,260
He must be feeling really upset right now because of me. He didn't even eat breakfast.

131
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:57,090
Do you want to eat another one? I bought ten. There are lots in the bag.

132
00:11:57,090 --> 00:12:00,330
Forget it. Fish-shaped bread only tastes good if you eat it with someone else.

133
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:03,050
It tastes terrible since I'm eating alone.

134
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,830
Is it so bad that you have to take a break from exercise?

135
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:14,070
- Is it that difficult? 
- It's not difficult,

136
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:16,040
but I have no motivation.

137
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:20,800
I lack the energy to do anything.

138
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,540
Then, what will you do while you rest?

139
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:26,890
Well, I don't have any plans as of now.

140
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:31,500
I'll either help out in the store or sleep to my heart's content.

141
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,910
Or I'll go deep into some mountains and cultivate my mentality—

142
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:37,120
You can never go to the mountains! If possible, stay in the neighborhood

143
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,260
and be within my range of sight, don't go too far.

144
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:45,050
If you get bored, call me. I'll play with you.

145
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:50,610
Call me even when you're not bored. I'll always play with you, I'll be on standby.

146
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:53,050
Cheer up, you rascal!

147
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:58,700
If you take the "girl-crush" out of Kim Bok Joo, you're left with just a corpse. You're a corpse right now!

148
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,420
Yeah, alright...

149
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:04,920
Call me as soon as you wake up. Call me before you eat. Call me before you go to the bathroom—

150
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:07,210
Are you a pervert? Why are you telling me to call you even before I go to the bathroom?

151
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:10,390
Then, take "before going to the bathroom" out. Eat lunch and

152
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:14,370
after eating lunch, call me. Eat dinner and after eating dinner, remember to call me. Understand?

153
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:19,140
Why would I call you? I'm not having such a hard time that I'd call and report everything to you.

154
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:22,600
Call me at 7:00 too. I like the time 7:00 too.

155
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:27,360
Kim Bok Joo, swag.

156
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,250
Ha, you really suck at it.

157
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:33,190
Kim Bok Joo, say swag.

158
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:36,470
- Swag.
 - Yeah, that's the one. Swag...

159
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:46,810
- You know how I feel, right?
 - Alright, it hurts!

160
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:48,590
I said, cheer up.

161
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:50,220
I said, I got it.

162
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:55,130
Swag. Swag.

163
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:01,560
You know, about Kim Bok Joo...

164
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,830
Why did she leave the dorm?

165
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:06,210
By any chance, did she drop-out?

166
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:09,460
Why? Are you hoping she did?

167
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:14,160
No, I don't feel that many bad feelings for her.

168
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,720
It's just that she's my roommate, after all.

169
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,280
What an amazing roommate you are.

170
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,240
Don't do it.

171
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:30,360
If I was going to make you clean, I wouldn't have told you to take a break.

172
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,860
Since you're already resting, rest to your heart's content

173
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:36,420
or go and do everything you've ever wanted to do without any regrets.

174
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,630
Give it to me, come on. I'll do it.

175
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:42,200
Hyung, you just go to the hospital and get your dialysis treatment without any regrets.

176
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:45,380
- Let's go together, Father.
 - Forget it, you have no business there.

177
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:48,350
I'm going to go alone, don't follow me.

178
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:30,340
  Things I want to do: 

179
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:34,360
  1. Study in the library 

180
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:38,780
  2. Learn an instrument 

181
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:40,690
  Maybe the piano? 

182
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:46,130
  3. Go to an amusement park on the weekdays and ride the Big 5 without having to wait in line. 

183
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:48,630

184
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:53,590
  4. Get a boyfriend 

185
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:58,990
  - Insert two straws in one cup and drink together. 

186
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:02,780
  - Put my hands in his pockets and walk together. 

187
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:06,600
  Receive a bouquet of 100 roses. 

188
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:21,250
So why is Bok Joo missing training?

189
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,190
- What's the reason?
 - Who knows?

190
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:27,010
Hey, Woong Gi, don't you know anything?

191
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:31,200
I don't know either. I talked to her over the phone but she didn't tell me anything in detail.

192
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,430
Don't you think those two might know something?

193
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:35,660
Hey, uglies! What's going on with Bok Joo?

194
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:39,010
I guess her condition isn't good.

195
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:42,700
Condition, bullsh*t. Her condition was perfectly fine until now.

196
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:49,260
As expected!

197
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:52,420
Even if I don't tell you what to do, you're all doing well.

198
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:56,430
No other students could be as good as you. There's nothing left for me, the professor, to do.

199
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:58,610
Oh, Min Young. Your hair's shorter.

200
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:00,720
I've had this hair for the past three years.

201
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,120
Really? It looks shorter.

202
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,560
Then I guess your f-face became longer.

203
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:11,330
Alright, today the long-awaited

204
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:13,360
winter training starts. You know that, right?

205
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,960
So don't slack off because the competition is over.

206
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,310
Today's practice determines tomorrow's results

207
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:22,560
so you have to work hard!

208
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,560
Okay, okay! Good!

209
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:32,250
Alright, warm your bodies up first and then start with snatches.

210
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:36,070
Kids, fighting!

211
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:41,490
Alright.

212
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:55,420
Oh, what do you want?

213
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:58,130
What will happen to the coach?

214
00:18:58,130 --> 00:19:02,040
Ah, that. I'm putting pressure on the Dean.

215
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,830
She will be reinstated soon.

216
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:08,160
So don't worry about her and focus on exercising.

217
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,320
That's what you can do for her too.

218
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,630
  Professor Yoon Deok Man 
Coach Choi Seong Eun 

219
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:34,600
Wow, this cruel rascal. Not even a single call from her.

220
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:41,190
 Professor Yoon Deok Man 

221
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:47,200
They should have started the winter training at this time.

222
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:52,340
Seong Eun, the towels are done!

223
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,930
Yeah!

224
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:00,890
Oh, it startled me.

225
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:07,330
Yes, this is Choi Seong Eun.

226
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:09,820
Yes, this is Kim Dae Ho.

227
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:14,020
Ah, by any chance, is this Bok Joo's uncle?

228
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:18,330
Are you free tonight? I'm planning to buy you a drink.

229
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:19,620
You've never had any learning experience before?

230
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:20,400
No.

231
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,160
Unni, how old are you?

232
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,340
Hye Eun, you have to go and practice.

233
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:26,300
Hye Soo, go in.

234
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:31,120
If you've never learned piano before, you have to come out at least three times a week.

235
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,260
The lesson fee is 150 dollars a month.

236
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:39,990
Ah, pricey, pricey. It is more expensive than I thought it would be.

237
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:47,830
To pay that lesson fee I need to a get part time job. Are there any jobs that pay well?

238
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,950
 - Oh you came.
 - Yes, yes. Hello. 

239
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:55,300
 Aigoo that's okay. 

240
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:57,670
 -That's okay!
 - Ah, thank you. 

241
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:07,740
The doctor is friendly as always.

242
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:15,660
Ah, I don't know, I don't know.  Let's get a part time job.

243
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:17,630
Part time, part time, part time!

244
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:19,380
I said no!

245
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:21,930
Ahjussi! Ahjussi!

246
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:24,350
I'm telling you I can do a good job, Ahjussi.

247
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:28,940
Hey! Even strong men can't handle a week of this work and quit.

248
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:33,200
How would a young woman do it? There's no way.

249
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:38,770
I'm extremely thankful that you're calling me miss, but I'm not just any Miss. I'm a miss who does weightlifting!

250
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:41,580
I'm telling you that I can lift 100kg!

251
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,380
- Weightlifter? 
 - Yes.

252
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:45,800
Really?

253
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:48,770
I even won first in a recent competition. Do you want me to show you the article?

254
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:53,960
No, no even then you can't work here. That's just sports. This is real work. You can't compare those two.

255
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:56,170
You can't even do it even with a very strong back strength.

256
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:59,270
- Aw man.  
 - Manager, can you get these— 

257
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:01,680
Can I put these over there, Ajusshi?

258
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:05,310
Aigoo. It's heavy! Very heavy.

259
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:07,860
Ah what do you mean it's heavy? It's so light!

260
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:11,080
This? This too?

261
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:17,000
Aigoo. This is so heavy. This must be the heavy one. This is heavy.

262
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:29,520
Okay. Just a moment.

263
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,860
Ah, I told her I'd play with her.

264
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:42,460
Why isn't she answering again?

265
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:46,130
Is she sleeping?

266
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:51,310
Bok Joo!
 Hyung Jae Yi 

267
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,620
Yes, Hyung.

268
00:23:58,890 --> 00:24:04,820
Here. I ran here because I didn't want it to cool. What's up?

269
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:09,940
Ah, I was just on the way to Ah Yeong and thought you'd be in the swimming pool.

270
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:12,160
Are you going to eat dinner with Doc?

271
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,690
We'll see.

272
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:18,780
In any case, you are quite the player, playing with girls' hearts as you please.

273
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:25,830
Well, I can't deny it since I've sinned, but I feel like I've been wronged.

274
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:28,430
And my life's motto was to live without doing bad things.

275
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:34,150
That's why it's worse. If you were a straight-up bad person, I could curse at you.

276
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:36,220
Oh, really, rascal.

277
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:41,210
So how is Bok Joo doing these days?. Is she doing well?

278
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:42,590
Why are you asking that?

279
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:46,340
I can't even ask that? Of course, I'd be worried about her.

280
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:50,220
Aigoo, forget it. Do not worry about her anymore.

281
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:55,860
Don't have any interest! You're still in the danger zone. I'll take care of Bok Joo.

282
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:57,760
Hey you—

283
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,410
What?

284
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:05,720
I'm right, huh? She is not just a friend, is she?

285
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,750
You like her, don't you?

286
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:15,490
I don't know. I must be crazy. She is really not my style of girl.

287
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:19,430
How can a person have a style they like? If you come to like them, you like them.

288
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:24,770
I knew it. Whenever you guys are together, your eyes start sparkling.

289
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:26,750
Treat her well. That friend is cute.

290
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:31,750
She's that cute, but you rejected her? You made that child cry for no reason, and you suck at picking up signals.

291
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:35,650
You should have noticed the moment she asked if you liked Messi!

292
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:38,790
I didn't know that was what it meant.

293
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:44,200
So, when are you going to confess?

294
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:50,830
I'll wait and see. I don't think it's the right time yet. She's been in a slump lately.

295
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:51,660
Ah, okay.

296
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:57,350
She took a break from sports too. I should just watch over her from the side while she gets over it, and wait for the proper time.

297
00:25:57,350 --> 00:26:03,080
Ah, you're not kidding around. And who said you weren't my brother?

298
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,370
You really like her.

299
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:06,990
Of course. Why would I be faking?

300
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:14,250
Hyung, if you make her cry one more time, just watch. I'm going to just—

301
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:19,450
How frightening, do you plan on hitting your brother?

302
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:22,810
Well... I won't hit you.

303
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:28,830
Oh, what do you mean, congratulations? I'll get loads of work.

304
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:31,200
You know there is a lot of work needing to be done in the Association, don't you? Yes.

305
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:35,720
Unni, when our professor becomes a director of the Association, will we get some benefits from it?

306
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,180
Will it be advantageous for us in the competition?

307
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:41,300
Oh, well... It wouldn't be bad.

308
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:45,560
Is she sleeping right now?

309
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:49,610
What's wrong with her lately? Her dark circles have reached down to here.

310
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:54,900
Enjoy it.

311
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:57,120
Yes, thank you.

312
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,500
I said that I was going to buy you something delicious, but it's only rice soup? I tried to buy you something expensive.

313
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:02,900
I've been in the mood for their rice soup since a few days ago.

314
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,800
This place used to be our go-to restaurant during our college days.

315
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:09,260
We used to eat this one until we were sick of it. But nothing has changed in this place.

316
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:13,100
What's to change about this place? Only people change.

317
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:15,700
By the way, Sunbae Sang Go didn't come after all.

318
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:17,710
It's said he had something come up suddenly or something.

319
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:20,390
I tried to spy on whether he lives well or not.

320
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:23,020
Is that so?

321
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:28,180
Oh, by the way. Joon Hyeong and Bok Joo. Has there been any progress in their relationship since then?

322
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:31,030
I'm not sure.

323
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:33,360
I'd really like for them to work out well.

324
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:38,060
From what I see, rather than a girl who's like a fox, someone like Bok Joo is perfect for Joon Hyeong.

325
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:41,830
First off she has a great personality, like me.

326
00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:46,060
That's what you ultimately wanted to say, right?

327
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:49,470
I also hope those two work out well.

328
00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:52,930
Hey, Hyung.

329
00:27:52,930 --> 00:27:59,070
Hey, Hyung. There are no deliveries or anything so let's just close up for today.  Our mood's not the best either.

330
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:05,570
This damned wench. Seriously, even my mood is going down because of that rascal Bok Joo.

331
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:08,210
But, say ...

332
00:28:08,210 --> 00:28:12,820
I think it'll be good for me to raise my mood by playing some billiards or something.

333
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,660
Aigoo, our future nephew-in-law. You came?

334
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:29,740
Hello.

335
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:32,290
Well, our household is not exactly in a "hello" kind of mood.

336
00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:34,600
Is Bok Joo possibly inside? She's not answering her phone.

337
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:35,790
Bok Joo isn't home.

338
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:36,480
What?

339
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:40,070
She's at her part time job. She called to say she'd be late.

340
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:41,610
Part time?

341
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:02,580
You're really impressive. There's something different about a weightlifter after all.

342
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:07,440
Well, I've been lifting heavy things ever since I was younger. Something like this is just like a feather.

343
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:11,160
This is really your vocation. Let's take this as our permanent job.

344
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:14,400
Since the supervisor left, we can go too.

345
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,020
Yes, Oppa.

346
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,720
You must be hungry after using up all that energy.

347
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:22,990
Yes. I  was already hungry, not even an hour after eating dinner.

348
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:27,770
Would you like to eat a bowl of noodles at the stand in front of this place? I'll treat you for your getting a job here.

349
00:29:27,770 --> 00:29:29,750
Really? Can I eat two?

350
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:34,140
Ah, Oppa has a lot of money. I'll even buy you some dumplings.

351
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:36,140
Oh, you're playing hard!

352
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:37,950
Kim Bok Joo!

353
00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:43,360
Jeong Joon Hyeong, what are you doing here?

354
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:47,030
What do you mean? I'm here to see you.

355
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:48,890
How did you know about this place?

356
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:53,700
I went to your place to eat chicken and your uncle told me.

357
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:04,260
I'm sorry, but since my friend's here, maybe we can eat noodles next time.

358
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:07,260
Then your friend can join us.

359
00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:10,960
I have an allergy to noodles

360
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:15,280
You can eat something else. Over there, the tender bones dish is famous. The lady is very good at cooking that dish.

361
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,150
Tender bones dish?

362
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:20,220
Whenever I eat with someone unfamiliar,

363
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:23,340
I get slight social phobia and use violence.

364
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:25,900
I  curse  a bit too.

365
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:29,210
Hey!

366
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:40,940
Um, my friend is a bit sick.

367
00:30:44,090 --> 00:30:46,120
Then I'll be heading out first. See you tomorrow.

368
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:49,060
Let's eat noodles together next time, Oppa.

369
00:30:55,950 --> 00:30:59,010
You're going through so much at such a young age. Cheer up.

370
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,430
Hey, what's wrong with you? Are you really allergic to noodles?

371
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:08,300
Sometimes, when I'm not in good condition.

372
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:10,140
Let's go.

373
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:14,570
Yeah.

374
00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:20,660
♬   I don't want a lot for Christmas. There is just one thing I need   ♬

375
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:25,280
Aish!

376
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:28,740
It's because you're in such a rush. Here.

377
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:32,950
But, what's with that slimy looking man from before? Is he a regular employee there?

378
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:36,240
Oh, that oppa.

379
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:40,450
He's working part-time while on break from school. He treats me so well because I'm like his younger sister.

380
00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:42,240
Oppa?

381
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:45,110
What oppa?! How long have you seen him that you're already calling him oppa?!

382
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:48,720
You! Don't go around looking clueless!

383
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:53,180
Hey, you have to be wary of all men aside from your father and uncle.

384
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:56,970
Then what about you? Do I have to be wary of you too? You're a man.

385
00:31:56,970 --> 00:32:01,340
Me... Take me out of that list.

386
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:03,400
What is he saying?

387
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:06,230
How's your part-time job? Is it okay?

388
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:09,730
I heard that it's a job that even most men find difficult.

389
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:13,490
It is hard. It's different from lifting weights,

390
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:19,310
but it's manageable. After working for a short period of time, I sweat so much

391
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:26,780
but when I drink a cup of sweet instant coffee during my break, the feeling is killer.

392
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:29,820
If someone saw you, they would think that you've done manual labor for years now.

393
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:36,170
To be honest, I'm telling this to just you, but I'm going to learn piano with the money I earn from the job.

394
00:32:36,170 --> 00:32:40,570
Piano? What? It's not the cello, but the piano?

395
00:32:40,570 --> 00:32:44,360
I just chose the cello back then because I saw a cello decoration on his desk.

396
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,880
Since I was young, playing the piano was my fantasy.

397
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:52,280
All of the girls in my class could play "Butterfly" on the piano, I was the only one who couldn't. Ever since I can remember, I only trained.

398
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:57,430
Because of my indomitable mind, I want to learn to play it too. But I think it'll be too hard,

399
00:32:57,430 --> 00:33:00,170
and the instruction fee is much more expensive than the piano.

400
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:03,790
Ah! Anyway, I'm so excited!

401
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:06,110
Do, Re, Mi, Do, Re, Mi...

402
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:10,520
It'll suit you well. Your fingers are long too.

403
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:14,400
Hey, I'll play the piano at your wedding.

404
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:18,200
I'll decline. You're going to ruin my wedding.

405
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:22,280
Instead, you can stand next to me.

406
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:25,510
Are you crazy? Your bride has to stand next to you, why would I stand there?!

407
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:29,210
Fine! I won't stand you next to me! Don't stand next to me!

408
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:32,540
Just eat!

409
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:37,740
Hey, and don't talk to that slimy salamander. It makes me feel bad.

410
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:40,710
Hey, wasn't that oppa kind of handsome?

411
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:47,020
Here. Now, let's listen to your story.

412
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:49,170
What have you been doing lately?

413
00:33:49,170 --> 00:33:53,490
I've just been helping out my older sister. She runs a hair salon in front of  Jung Ang University.

414
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:55,340
Scissor-hands?

415
00:33:56,270 --> 00:33:59,720
Does it match your aptitude?

416
00:34:01,090 --> 00:34:05,400
What aptitude? I'm just taking small side-jobs.

417
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:09,690
Hey, let's drink at the same pace.

418
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:13,760
Thank you.

419
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,550
Here, here.

420
00:34:18,650 --> 00:34:21,870
Um, a-are you okay? Do you think you can walk? Huh?

421
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:26,150
Yes...ugh...

422
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:28,690
Let go.

423
00:34:30,930 --> 00:34:33,580
Here,

424
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:35,440
get on my back.

425
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:38,850
Why are you being good to me?

426
00:34:38,850 --> 00:34:41,830
How am I good to you?

427
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:45,560
What's the big deal about lending you my back? Now, come on.

428
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:51,390
Um...

429
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:55,890
Uncle, do you like me?

430
00:34:55,890 --> 00:34:58,850
This old woman, seriously.

431
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:05,410
I mean, old women like you—

432
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,220
I do like you.

433
00:35:11,010 --> 00:35:14,480
I like you. Why? Can't I like you?

434
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:19,580
No, that's possible. A human likes another human.

435
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:22,140
Um, that...

436
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:29,870
That one single thing that no one can ever figure out, that's love.

437
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:33,730
Yes, fine. Fine...

438
00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:36,440
There's nothing to it, let's date.

439
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:37,530
What?

440
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:40,410
I said let's date.

441
00:35:40,410 --> 00:35:44,950
Before I become an old wrinkly can,

442
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:49,120
let's date! There's nothing special about it!

443
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:51,430
Are you serious?

444
00:35:51,430 --> 00:35:54,900
I mean, I mean...You're not saying this because you're drunk,

445
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:58,180
but you're serious about this? For real?

446
00:35:58,180 --> 00:36:02,790
What? You can't trust me? Should I make you trust me?

447
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:18,850
You don't have to take me back home. I can just beat up anyone who comes onto me.

448
00:36:18,850 --> 00:36:23,680
Hey, don't act up. No matter how strong you are, you can't win against a man.

449
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:26,520
Still? Even like this?

450
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,620
Hey, I take back what I said! Cancel!

451
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:32,180
You're no match for me, yet you're acting up.

452
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:41,160
The scent of winter is nice, it's refreshing.

453
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:45,260
It's cold. I wish spring came quickly.

454
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:50,060
Joon Hyeong, I saw the doctor on the street earlier.

455
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:51,890
Really?

456
00:36:51,890 --> 00:36:54,540
You two seem to coincidentally run into each other often.

457
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:57,630
No, he didn't see me. I was the only one who saw him.

458
00:36:57,630 --> 00:36:59,900
So? How did it feel to see him again?

459
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:02,800
Did your heart still tear apart to shreds?

460
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,320
No, not that.

461
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:07,900
It felt strange.

462
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:13,090
The times when I attended the clinic because I was obsessing over him seem like such a long time ago.

463
00:37:13,090 --> 00:37:15,320
You know when you catch a cold

464
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:19,790
that won't go away, even if you take medicine and do all sorts of things, and when the symptoms start to ease up,

465
00:37:19,790 --> 00:37:22,870
you feel that it's the end.

466
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:26,870
Then that means you're fine now. That's good.

467
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:28,910
Well, I guess.

468
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:34,090
Like you said in the past, I think time is taking care of everything.

469
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:38,700
We're here. You should leave now.

470
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:43,340
Hey, can't you take me to the front of the school? Then I'll take you back to your house again.

471
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:47,070
What are you talking about? Hurry up and leave. I have to work overtime tomorrow so I have to rest today.

472
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:49,530
What? You work overtime too?

473
00:37:49,530 --> 00:37:52,270
Yeah. They said that they have a lot of work tomorrow so I should work overtime.

474
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:55,280
How can they order a part-timer to work overtime?

475
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,140
- Then you'll end in the middle of the night.
 - Yeah.

476
00:37:57,140 --> 00:38:00,580
It's fine. If I work together with that oppa from before, I'll finish quickly.

477
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:01,760
Oppa?

478
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,070
Leave.

479
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:05,990
I mean, why do you keep talking about that oppa?

480
00:38:05,990 --> 00:38:07,870
Leave!

481
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:11,630
It hasn't even been that long since she's met him. How can she keep on talking about that oppa?

482
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:14,790
Now, whenever someone buys her food, she automatically calls them oppa.

483
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:20,980
What should I do about this? Do I have to go again tomorrow?

484
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:26,150
What are you looking at?!

485
00:38:29,410 --> 00:38:31,590
Ah, oppa...

486
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:34,040
"Oppa"!

487
00:38:54,570 --> 00:38:55,740
A ghost?

488
00:38:55,740 --> 00:39:00,670
Yeah, yeah. A student from the fencing department went to the bathroom and almost fainted after seeing a bare-footed ghost.

489
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:04,020
Come on. Are you sure that she didn't just hallucinate because she was half-asleep? Are all bare-footed people ghosts?

490
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:09,250
Hey, that's not it. Her pale bare feet were floating this high from the floor.

491
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:23,050
- Ah!
 - Hey!

492
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:26,560
Her nickname is the bare-footed ghost.

493
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:31,420
According to the kids, she's the ghost of a track student who had her medal taken away because of doping charges 15 years ago

494
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:35,440
and jumped off of the roof because of it. They say it's probably that ghost.

495
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,460
Oh my god!

496
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:38,450
So? Is the ghost pretty?

497
00:39:38,450 --> 00:39:41,090
Ugh! Hey, sorry. Continue.

498
00:39:41,090 --> 00:39:45,970
To be honest, that ghost took diet pills given to her by a friend and got caught doping.

499
00:39:45,970 --> 00:39:50,910
- Goodness.
 - So every night, she went searching for that friend as a ghost!

500
00:39:50,910 --> 00:39:52,570
- What do we do?
 - Stop it!

501
00:39:52,570 --> 00:39:56,530
- Come on!
 - That's terrifying!

502
00:39:56,530 --> 00:39:58,480
- I'm scared!
 - Stop it!

503
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,630
  Bok Joo, come eat! 

504
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:08,580
Yeah!

505
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:13,750
Ah, so irritating. Why is it swelling?

506
00:40:14,810 --> 00:40:16,730
What are you doing? I told you to come eat.

507
00:40:16,730 --> 00:40:19,830
I was on my way out. I'll be out after I change.

508
00:40:19,830 --> 00:40:22,210
Come out quickly. The stew will cool down.

509
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:37,550
Oh, fermented soybean stew! The smell is killer.

510
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:39,040
What? Do you want to mix it with something?

511
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,120
Yeah, I'll go get it.

512
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:48,830
Give it to me. I'll mix it for you.

513
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:56,970
Father, aren't you going to ask what kind of part-time job I'm doing?

514
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:03,530
Why would I ask that? It's fine as long as you're not doing bad things.

515
00:41:03,530 --> 00:41:09,180
I won't interfere with every single thing anymore. You can train when you want to and decide if you want to continue or not.

516
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:13,130
Do whatever you want. It's your life, not mine.

517
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:17,110
Here, try some. I mixed it deliciously.

518
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:22,110
- It's so salty, Father. 
 - Really?

519
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:24,740
Sorry, sorry.

520
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:30,480
Where has that bastard, Dae Ho, disappeared to in the morning? He's not around here.

521
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:41,080
Ugh, seriously! I'm crazy, I'm crazy, I'm crazy! I won't drink anymore, no more!

522
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:43,630
Ah, alcohol is really my enemy! Seriously.

523
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:46,750
What's wrong? Did you do something after drinking last night?

524
00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:51,830
I don't know! This is all because of you! If only you hadn't borrowed money...

525
00:41:51,830 --> 00:41:54,300
Forget it. I just shouldn't say anything.

526
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:56,460
Ah, what do I do?

527
00:41:56,460 --> 00:42:00,050
  Yeah, it was something done while we were drunk so let's just think that it never happened. 

528
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:02,340
  It's possible that he doesn't remember because he was drunk. 

529
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:05,400
Welcome! Please sit here. What should I do for you?

530
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:08,440
Yes, um... that...

531
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:14,290
What are you doing over there?

532
00:42:19,630 --> 00:42:21,890
You're here.

533
00:42:21,890 --> 00:42:23,220
Hangover?

534
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,470
Bok Joo, you're good at working. You're quite the catch.

535
00:42:29,470 --> 00:42:33,590
Right? My family runs a chicken restaurant and my father said that I was born to be a worker there.

536
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:36,770
Do you have a boyfriend? If you don't, I'd like to introduce you to my nephew.

537
00:42:36,770 --> 00:42:40,100
Really? Then should I meet him?

538
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:45,310
Hey, you have a boyfriend. That friend of yours with anger boiling in his eyes yesterday.

539
00:42:45,310 --> 00:42:46,630
I think he looked like me.

540
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:48,220
Hey! He's not my boyfriend.

541
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:52,440
Come on. Anyone could tell that you two aren't just friends. He was even shooting lasers at me.

542
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:57,680
He's just a boy-person. A person, human!

543
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:59,320
Aren't I better?

544
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:01,590
You're much better.

545
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:07,800
Boss. When will you introduce me to your nephew?

546
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:11,650
Hey, let's go out. It's been a while. Let's go out to the PC room and let out some stress.

547
00:43:11,650 --> 00:43:13,210
I don't want to. I don't have the feels for playing games tonight.

548
00:43:13,210 --> 00:43:18,390
Okay! Since your will is that strong, I'll just cooly leave by myself.

549
00:43:18,390 --> 00:43:20,900
- Rest up! Rest all you want!
 - Aish, hey!

550
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:23,560
- Whee!
 - Aish, that!

551
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:35,440
Kim Bok Joo, you're saying that you're even working overtime today too, huh?

552
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:40,450
  Ah, that oppa? He's working there part-time while he's on break from school. He treats me so well 

553
00:43:40,450 --> 00:43:42,870
  because he sees me as a younger sister. 

554
00:43:45,430 --> 00:43:49,270
Ah, that loser bastard had really lustful eyes.

555
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:52,780
- I'll bring some more from the storage. 
 - We can go together. They're heavy.

556
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:54,400
Finish moving the boxes.

557
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:57,270
Yes, take care!

558
00:43:57,270 --> 00:44:02,250
Ah, seriously! My shoelaces, seriously! Ugh...

559
00:44:03,170 --> 00:44:05,040
I can't see.

560
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:10,950
Oh? How did you get in?

561
00:44:10,950 --> 00:44:15,410
What do you mean? I walked in. Do you still have a lot of work left?

562
00:44:15,410 --> 00:44:18,770
Yeah, a bit. Why are you here again?

563
00:44:18,770 --> 00:44:24,430
Well, I just went to the club but the atmosphere there wasn't so good.

564
00:44:24,430 --> 00:44:27,430
You should go to the club in moderation. Your bones will rot, you bastard!

565
00:44:27,430 --> 00:44:32,530
It's fine. My bones are strong. If you have a lot of work left, should I help you?

566
00:44:32,530 --> 00:44:35,800
Forget it. Hurry up and leave before other people come.

567
00:44:43,810 --> 00:44:46,680
Seriously, I told you it was fine! Hurry up and leave!

568
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:50,610
I'll just help you since I'm already here. You need to finish this soon to leave.

569
00:44:50,610 --> 00:44:54,980
That's not what I mean. People might form strange misunderstandings.

570
00:44:54,980 --> 00:44:56,700
What kind of misunderstandings?

571
00:44:56,700 --> 00:45:02,190
They keep asking me if you're my boyfriend and won't believe me even when I tell them we're just friends.

572
00:45:02,190 --> 00:45:06,860
So if you're like this, there's no need to even ask. Hurry up and leave!

573
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:13,380
It's not a misunderstanding.

574
00:45:15,620 --> 00:45:17,640
What?

575
00:45:18,910 --> 00:45:21,370
You're not just a friend.

576
00:45:32,170 --> 00:45:34,720
You're a special friend to me.

577
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:40,620
Do you not understand what I'm saying?

578
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:05,700
♬   I dream of it. Please let us be happy forever   ♬

579
00:46:05,730 --> 00:46:07,960
♬   I dream of it   ♬

580
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:10,680
You, what are you doing right now? Have you lost your mind?!

581
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:14,020
Yeah, I've lost my mind. How could I do this without losing my mind?

582
00:46:14,020 --> 00:46:15,200
What?

583
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:17,100
You idiot.

584
00:46:18,430 --> 00:46:21,430
I said I like you,

585
00:46:21,430 --> 00:46:23,820
not as a friend but as a woman.

586
00:46:25,660 --> 00:46:27,450
I get curious when I can't see you,

587
00:46:27,450 --> 00:46:34,290
I get concerned when you're depressed, I feel happy when you laugh and get worried when you're hurt, so it's driving me insane.

588
00:46:34,290 --> 00:46:38,750
This...means I like you, doesn't it?

589
00:46:40,490 --> 00:46:45,760
♬  than the days drenched in tears  ♬

590
00:46:55,620 --> 00:46:59,670
Is he sleeping? Joon Hyeong!

591
00:46:59,670 --> 00:47:01,740
Jeong Joon Hyeong!

592
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:06,870
Which rascal locked the window?

593
00:47:06,870 --> 00:47:09,270
I'm freezing to death here!

594
00:47:10,030 --> 00:47:13,600
Mom, how can I go down right now? Winter training just started.

595
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:17,430
Next week, we'll have special permission to go out. I'll go there at that time.

596
00:47:17,430 --> 00:47:22,220
Just hire someone. Until when will you—

597
00:47:22,220 --> 00:47:25,050
Mom? Mo—

598
00:47:34,670 --> 00:47:36,730
Who—

599
00:47:36,730 --> 00:47:38,860
It's me, me, Comrade Tae Gwon, Comrade Tae Gwon.

600
00:47:38,860 --> 00:47:39,980
What's with you? Why are you coming from over there?

601
00:47:39,980 --> 00:47:43,310
I just came back from the PC room and someone locked our window,

602
00:47:43,310 --> 00:47:47,700
but this window was open and I heard a familiar voice inside so...

603
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:49,420
Did you hear?

604
00:47:49,420 --> 00:47:53,680
No, no, I didn't hear what you were saying. I just heard your voice.

605
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:57,060
I got it so you should leave now. You'll be in the wrong if you get caught.

606
00:47:57,060 --> 00:48:01,800
- But— 
 - Where did Soon Ok go?

607
00:48:13,630 --> 00:48:16,050
Ugh, my stomach.

608
00:48:16,050 --> 00:48:18,390
Were the chicken feet too spicy?

609
00:48:18,390 --> 00:48:22,080
We always eat together but my stomach is the only one that has a problem.

610
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:25,470
Lee Soon Ok, where did she go in the middle of the night?

611
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:51,400
Go! Go, go! Go away, go away! Go, go, go! Go!

612
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:52,400
What's wrong? What's going on?

613
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:54,160
There's a ghost over there!

614
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:54,930
Nan Hee, what's wrong?!

615
00:48:54,930 --> 00:48:58,130
There was a ghost over there!

616
00:48:58,130 --> 00:48:59,560
Where? There's nothing there.

617
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:02,130
It was right there!

618
00:49:02,130 --> 00:49:06,680
It's gone now! I swear it was there!

619
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:09,420
I'm so scared...

620
00:49:29,870 --> 00:49:33,590
Hey, you should stop punishing me and say something now.

621
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:38,230
Bok Joo.

622
00:49:39,750 --> 00:49:44,300
I mean, why? Why is it me?

623
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:45,520
What?

624
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:47,860
I mean, it just doesn't make sense.

625
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:53,280
Until recently, I cried, threw tantrums, and did all sorts of strange things because I liked your older brother, so how...

626
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:56,240
By any chance, are you doing this because you find me pitiful? Huh?

627
00:49:56,240 --> 00:50:00,550
Because I'm always having one-sided crushes and remain single, do you feel bad for me?

628
00:50:00,550 --> 00:50:02,720
Hey, am I some sort of charity organization?

629
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:03,620
Then why do you like me?

630
00:50:03,620 --> 00:50:06,350
How can I explain that?

631
00:50:06,350 --> 00:50:12,020
There's no reason as to why I like you. I like you because I like you

632
00:50:12,020 --> 00:50:18,130
and when I think about it, it's true that I've liked you since a long time ago.

633
00:50:20,870 --> 00:50:23,630
You're my first love.

634
00:50:28,210 --> 00:50:30,150
"Ha"?

635
00:50:30,150 --> 00:50:34,120
What's the meaning of that "ha"? Do you not like me?

636
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:39,360
It's not that I don't like you.

637
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:42,790
Well, I like you too.

638
00:50:42,790 --> 00:50:47,850
These days, there are times when I lean on you more than Soon Ok or Nan Hee, and you're reliable too.

639
00:50:47,850 --> 00:50:53,190
Also, well you are... honestly kind of handsome.

640
00:50:53,190 --> 00:50:58,320
I didn't admit it at first, but the more I see you, it looks like it.

641
00:50:58,320 --> 00:51:01,990
- But... 
 - But?

642
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:08,090
I like you as a friend.  I have never thought of you as a man.

643
00:51:08,090 --> 00:51:11,370
Then you can start thinking of me in that way.

644
00:51:11,370 --> 00:51:15,190
From now on, go out with me for a month.

645
00:51:15,190 --> 00:51:20,220
Then you can see if I have any charms as a man, how I am as a boyfriend, if I'm alright.

646
00:51:20,220 --> 00:51:23,830
Experience it as much as you want and decide whether you want to return me or not.

647
00:51:23,830 --> 00:51:27,260
Are you some kind of home-shopping network product? Experience it and return it if I don't like it?

648
00:51:27,260 --> 00:51:31,330
Then, you're just going to reject me?

649
00:51:31,330 --> 00:51:37,300
Hey, you and I built up affection for each other during all that time. Shouldn't you at least give me that much of time?

650
00:51:39,020 --> 00:51:43,010
Then I'll take it that you accepted. Let's go, it's cold.

651
00:51:45,180 --> 00:51:47,890
That lunatic, seriously...

652
00:51:49,460 --> 00:51:51,210
Aren't you coming?

653
00:51:51,210 --> 00:51:57,000
What should I do?  Ah, seriously.

654
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:01,980
G-Go ahead.

655
00:52:01,980 --> 00:52:04,220
Go! What do you want?

656
00:52:05,930 --> 00:52:09,090
Why do you keep staring at me? I said, let's go.

657
00:52:22,420 --> 00:52:25,000
Aigoo, Kim Bok Joo, really.

658
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:25,900
What?

659
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:27,800
Are you really going to make it so obvious, dowdily?

660
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:31,000
Why are you suddenly acting awkward?

661
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:35,340
What do you mean, awkward? Seriously. Is it obvious?

662
00:52:35,340 --> 00:52:37,860
Well, this is your first confession after all...

663
00:52:37,860 --> 00:52:42,030
Still, act natural. Natural!

664
00:52:42,030 --> 00:52:46,710
I'm natural right now. You're just uselessly having unnatural thoughts right now.

665
00:52:50,660 --> 00:52:52,990
- Oh, Nan Hee. 
  - Bok Joo. 

666
00:52:52,990 --> 00:52:56,010
I almost died from a heart-attack today.

667
00:52:56,010 --> 00:53:02,660
My heart is pounding right now too! I think I'm going to die of fright! I just saw a ghost.

668
00:53:02,660 --> 00:53:07,260
I can't explain this over the phone. I think I'll be less scared if you're here.

669
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:10,100
Come quickly, Bok Joo! I really think I'm going to die of fright!

670
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:14,600
Alright, I'll go home first and tell my dad before coming. Yeah.

671
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:17,690
- What's wrong? Are the Uglies telling you to come?
 -Yeah.

672
00:53:17,690 --> 00:53:21,880
They said that they saw a ghost or something. I don't know. I have to go home quickly, so I'll leave first.

673
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:24,310
- Hey, I'll walk you home.
 - Forget it.

674
00:53:24,310 --> 00:53:26,670
it's just right around the corner. Don't walk me home, just leave.

675
00:53:31,050 --> 00:53:37,440
Anyway, she really loves her friends. She's so loyal.

676
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:40,710
Ugh, as I expected, I'm rejected as it is.

677
00:53:40,710 --> 00:53:44,600
Ah, if it weren't for that slimy-looking bastard! Seriously.

678
00:53:46,910 --> 00:53:49,350
What is this?

679
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:55,780
Is this Kim Bok Joo's?

680
00:54:01,370 --> 00:54:04,580
It is Bok Joo's.

681
00:54:07,100 --> 00:54:10,890
Why does she carry around so much money?

682
00:54:10,890 --> 00:54:14,410
Ah, her daily pay.

683
00:54:14,410 --> 00:54:21,020
She's so careless that she loses the daily pay she earned by even working overtime.

684
00:54:24,220 --> 00:54:29,690
Let's see. Aside from money, what else does Kim Bok Joo have in her wallet?

685
00:54:32,270 --> 00:54:36,340
Wow, look at her expression. This isn't a wanted picture.

686
00:54:36,340 --> 00:54:40,690
Her eyes are ugly, her nose is ugly,

687
00:54:40,690 --> 00:54:46,080
and her mouth is ugly too but strangely, she's intriguing

688
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:48,020
and cute.

689
00:54:52,820 --> 00:54:55,610
What? What is this? What is this? What is this?!

690
00:54:55,610 --> 00:54:56,990
Jeong Jae Yi!

691
00:54:56,990 --> 00:54:58,760
Jeong Jae Yi!

692
00:55:07,350 --> 00:55:10,050
What is this?

693
00:55:10,050 --> 00:55:12,890
"The things I want to do"?

694
00:55:12,890 --> 00:55:15,570
Ah, it's a bucket list.

695
00:55:15,570 --> 00:55:18,780
"1. Study in the library."

696
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:22,840
What nonsense. I bet $100 she'll fall asleep in five minutes.

697
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:26,490
"2. Learn an instrument: piano."

698
00:55:26,490 --> 00:55:28,930
Piano? Well, I heard about this.

699
00:55:28,930 --> 00:55:33,230
"3. Go to the amusement park on a weekday and ride the Big 5 without waiting in line"

700
00:55:33,230 --> 00:55:39,210
Right. If you go to the amusement park on the weekend, you spend the entire day waiting in line.

701
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:44,600
4. This is the point!

702
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:48,480
This, this is the point!

703
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:51,700
Even the things she wants to do with her boyfriend are so simple.

704
00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:55,100
Ugh, so loud!

705
00:55:59,970 --> 00:56:05,380
Okay, I've received some very important information at a very important time.

706
00:56:05,380 --> 00:56:08,470
As expected, the heavens are helping me.

707
00:56:09,250 --> 00:56:12,320
So I came out after peeing

708
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:15,840
and something white and black suddenly passed across the hall.

709
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:21,510
I wondered what that was and looked back. Its hair flowed behind and it wore something similar to a white nightgown.

710
00:56:21,510 --> 00:56:27,380
♬   I dream of it. Please allow us to   ♬

711
00:56:27,380 --> 00:56:32,150
It went into the laundry area. I was so shocked! 
♬   be happy forever   ♬

712
00:56:32,150 --> 00:56:36,890
It's a relief that I saw it after I peed. If I hadn't, I really would have peed my pants.

713
00:56:36,890 --> 00:56:41,690
Of course and then you would have remained a legend as the girl who peed after seeing a ghost.

714
00:56:41,690 --> 00:56:46,060
 You idiot, I said I like you.  

715
00:56:46,060 --> 00:56:49,040
Right? You get goosebumps from just listening to it, don't you?

716
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:53,640
No matter how many times I listen to you, I just can't think of it as real. I don't believe in ghosts.

717
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:57,430
But thanks to that ghost or whatever, all three of us managed to meet again.

718
00:56:57,430 --> 00:57:00,430
When will you return, Miss Kim Bok Joo?

719
00:57:00,430 --> 00:57:03,910
What? Oh, well...

720
00:57:03,910 --> 00:57:07,980
Think in moderation and come back quickly, Bok Joo. That's how you'll beat up the ghost.

721
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:13,150
Right, the only warrior who can beat a ghost, both in terms of strength and guts, is Bok Joo.

722
00:57:13,150 --> 00:57:15,790
Hey, but why is your face so red? Are you running a fever?

723
00:57:15,790 --> 00:57:18,900
Huh? No, I don't have a fever. Why?

724
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:21,360
You're right, it's really red.

725
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:25,040
I guess it's because I just came back in from somewhere cold. I'm fine.

726
00:57:37,850 --> 00:57:41,710
Protect Nan Hee!

727
00:58:40,740 --> 00:58:44,550
Who... Who are you?

728
00:58:51,230 --> 00:58:55,500
