1
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:34,710


2
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,800
What happened?

3
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:57,520
  Athlete waiting room   

4
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,980
Where on earth did she go?

5
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:24,360
Oh Joo Hyeong.

6
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,530
Come out.

7
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:27,280
Oh! What's wrong?

8
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,320
Joon Hyeong.

9
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,380
How did you know to come here?

10
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:41,810
Ah Yeong told me about it when I went to see her. A sunbae of mine opened a clinic nearby.

11
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:43,870
She was my patient at one time, so I thought I should at least cheer her on.

12
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:47,040
Why would you come to cheer Bok Joo on ?!!

13
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:53,180
Hey, what's wrong with you? Why are you getting angry?

14
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:58,840
The person she likes is you, Hyung.

15
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,750
Bok Joo likes you!

16
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:07,810
That's why she was secretly going to the weight-loss clinic. She had such a hard time after you found out she was a weightlifter,

17
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:09,900
worrying that you would think she was a big liar.

18
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:15,330
And then, of all places, you turn up here. Bok Joo is a woman too, Hyung.

19
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:17,130
Do you think she would want to show the guy she has a crush on

20
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:20,840
her distorted face while weightlifting?

21
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:31,350
So please just leave, she's been hurt enough by you.

22
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:46,230
 Episode 10 
Periods or Commas   

23
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:52,930
That's it!

24
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:54,950
Professor.

25
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:57,370
Why do the corners of your mouth keep going up? Huh?

26
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:59,130
♬ Pick me Pick me... ♬

27
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:02,310
You told me not to focus too much on the results and now you're smiling like the Joker.

28
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:05,630
Joker or not, I don't care about that right now.

29
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:10,460
Our weightlifting club has achieved the best results in ten years.

30
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:13,840
Do you think I could think about that right now?

31
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:18,040
Our strategy worked perfectly. One gold, one silver and two bronze medals. Wow

32
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,720
I'm so happy I could dance right now, should I dance?

33
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,750
Oh no, please refrain yourself.

34
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:24,860
Oh oh.

35
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:29,920
Oh hello? Aigoo, you must be so happy, Sunbae!

36
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:35,560
Really? I understand. We'll do that. Thank you.

37
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,640
Stop the music.

38
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:47,140
- Shh.
 - First of all, some you had great results today.

39
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:52,220
Min Young, Woong Gi, Jung Woo, and Bok Joo.

40
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:54,140
You really worked hard. Applause

41
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:55,380
Thank you.

42
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,020
It's all thanks to you and the coach.

43
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:57,780
Thank you!

44
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:03,670
You know what? To me, you guys all deserve to stand on the medalist podium.

45
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:07,490
The people who were by their side encouraging them while they warmed up.

46
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:10,810
The people who gave them water while they were nervously waiting for their turn.

47
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:14,100
And also the people who sincerely applauded them when they had good results.

48
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:19,350
It's like those people lifted the barbells with you is what I'm saying.

49
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:24,560
In that sense, I just got some good news

50
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,340
Bok Chicken is hosting a dinner party for us tonight!!

51
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:38,290
Here it is, tell me if you want more.

52
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:41,090
Okay, wait a second. Quiet down. Quiet down

53
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:45,440
I'm not letting anyone go until they've had two chickens themselves, okay?

54
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,680
Yes!!

55
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:50,280
Sir, I'll leave first. I already had two chickens.

56
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:55,680
Ooh Team Captain, there is definitely something different about a silver medalist.

57
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:57,530
You eat five chickens!

58
00:05:57,530 --> 00:05:58,950
Yes sir.

59
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:02,430
Ah ! Professor Yoon should eat the most.

60
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:04,740
Aigoo, I'm eating. Thank you Sunbae.

61
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:05,570
Thank you.

62
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:11,990
Thank you so much for raising Bok Joo so well and sending her to us and for treating us like this.

63
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:16,530
Did I raise her well? You're the one who made her the athlete she is today.

64
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:20,810
No, Sunbae. It's all thanka to you. You really raised your daughter well.

65
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:27,280
Also, when we met for the first time, I said, "Who names their child Bok Joo (bundle of luck) in this generation? So old-fashioned."

66
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,340
I cancel that.

67
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:32,980
She is a total bundle of luck. Our Bok Joo.

68
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:39,070
It seems like this person did the most work. She even raised Bok Joo's weight class.

69
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:42,840
It looked like you really liked the pupa soup that time. Please have some

70
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,490
Ah, yes. Thank you.

71
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:51,190
Judging from the last time? You've come here to drink without me before?

72
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:52,310
No, no. Once—

73
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:54,310
Remember? Last time, I made you hangover soup in the morning—

74
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:59,590
Woong Gi!! Should we do our team cheer once more?

75
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:02,000
- Haneul weightlifting!!
 - C'mon!

76
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,300
♬ Haneul weightlifting oooh

77
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:24,750
♬  I've been hesitating for a long time  ♬

78
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:33,780

83

84

♬  I dream of it.  Please let us have youthful days  ♬

85
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:39,210
 Do you perhaps like Messi (Argentinian soccer player)

89
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:10,050
Oh-oh-oh-oh, it's starting!

90
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:13,480
Oh! That shocked me, why do I see my face?

91
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:17,550
You're a complete ahjussi. This is the self-cam mode.

92
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:20,490
Ooh, it's recording

93
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:26,800
Ya wow, Bok Joo is so pretty.

94
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,230
She is not really pretty.

95
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:31,710
She's pretty, jerk.

96
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:38,310
You guys worked hard yesterday, and there's more good news. Coach Choi?

97
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:40,360
I should tell them?

98
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:45,890
You know NS athletics that sometimes sponsors a few of our school teams?

99
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:46,720
Yes

100
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,460
We finally received a call from them

101
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:52,850
saying they'll sponsor our weightlifting team.

102
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:57,770
Will they start to treat us better?

103
00:09:57,770 --> 00:09:59,800
Can we eat as much as we want without worrying (about cost)?

104
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:05,270
Of course, of course. We aren't golden spoon level, but we should at least be able to eat as much as we want.

105
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:09,040
Anyway, you worked hard. But don't slack off now that the competition is over.

106
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,230
Until the day everyone sets a new record, let's keep working hard!

107
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:14,070
We'll work hard!

108
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:18,140
Go enjoy your food. Hurry!

109
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:24,310
Hey, Bok Joo! The people over at NS are considering signing you to their team.

110
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:26,070
Let's try to set up a meeting this weekend.

111
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:30,020
It looks like people in the executive level became your fans. They said they want to meet you.

112
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:32,070
Kim Bok Joo, swag! NS, swag!

113
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:34,100
S-W-A-G!

114
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:37,670
If you're happy, you can express it.  You don't have to be considerate of us.

115
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:38,870
That's right, congratulations!

116
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:44,950
You've nothing to feel bad about. Besides Bok Joo, they'll take a few more people. Work your hardest to be among those few.

117
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,960
- We know it! We know it! 
 - Of course.

118
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:50,960
Since I am friends with the ace, I get this kind of chance. Thanks Bok Joo.

119
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:53,620
Let's go eat.

120
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:59,560
Hey Bok Joo, are you counting the rice?

121
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:02,020
Why don't you have any strength lately?

122
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:07,470
You're right. Are you hurt? Or did you use too much strength at the competition, so your body aches?

123
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:09,040
No, I'm okay.

124
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,010
Oh-oh-oh, who do we have here?

125
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:16,790
The  Star weightlifter that was on the news yesterday, Kim Book Joo.

126
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:19,470
Would it be alright if I took a picture? Picture! Picture!

127
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:22,870
Don't recklessly take a picture. Please leave now.

128
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:25,510
Our Unni has to finish her meal.

129
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:30,160
I've lost my appetite so I'll leave first. Take your time eating.

130
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,980
Hey, Bok Joo.

131
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:36,220
Hey, I will also go. Take care of mine.

132
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:40,180
Oh hey, hey. Who's going to...

133
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:53,140
Hey! You almost got hurt. Get yourself together!

134
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:55,310
Sorry.

135
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:56,580
No...

136
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:00,810
You don't have to be sorry towards me. You should be sorry towards your own body.

137
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:05,650
It's not just an ordinary body but it's a body that won first place in the championship. You even don't know how precious it is.

138
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:09,270
I'm going to go first.

139
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,150
Hey.

140
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:16,300
You didn't even eat all your food. Are you going to be able to lift up metal balls later?

141
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:29,650
I didn't know what you would eat so pick and choose.

142
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:32,550
Yeah, thanks.

143
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:35,010
You're absolutely awesome, Kim Bok Joo.

144
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:38,560
I didn't believe people when they called you a rising star.

145
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:44,220
I heard you also broke a record. When I saw the news, I went around bragging.

146
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,800
Yeah.

147
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:52,200
Eat some. I spent all of my allowance to buy these.

148
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:56,270
I will eat it.

149
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:03,780
Why are you so depressed? Shouldn't you be jumping all over the place since you set a new record?

150
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:07,160
I've never been near first place, so I feel so inferior now.

151
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:20,150
Here, eat it. You really like this.

152
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:34,310
Look at me Bok Joo

153
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:36,860
What the heck? You're so childish.

154
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:42,110
Hey, you ridiculed me. Okay. Then should I show you something that's really funny?

155
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:46,640
Alright. Mimicking Bok Joo, number one.

156
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:50,760
"I even hit men, seriously!"

157
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:59,320
Number two, acting cute. Look.

158
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:15,510
Number three, running!

159
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:19,320
I really didn't want to go this far.

160
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:34,970
"Chicken is here. Who ordered chicken?"

161
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:37,750
"Chicken is here."

162
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:41,070
"Chicken, chicken! It's chicken! Chicken!"

163
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:43,290
Jeong Joon Hyeong.

164
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:45,920
Are you not busy today?

165
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:05,210
Oh, it's so cold today.

166
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:07,840
Hey, can you take off your clothes and give them to me, Fatty?

167
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:11,580
No no it's fine! I'm just kidding.

168
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:15,740
Cheer up already.

169
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:21,620
If someone saw you, they'd think you're all down because you were consecutively disqualified in a competition.

170
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:24,830
Have some strength.

171
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:32,240
Okay then. I will bother you. Do you want to hit me?

172
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:38,650
I'm tired. I'm going to go and sleep.

173
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:55,010
I saw you get on the podium. You got first place?

174
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:57,040
Yes.

175
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,810
Congratulations.

176
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,200
Yes, Doctor.

177
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:32,810
Are you free to talk?

178
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:35,420
Yes, of course. Please talk.

179
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:39,190
W-Where? Are you at school? Hmm,  are you practicing?

180
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:43,670
No, I'm resting right now. For what reason?

181
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:47,480
Then, can you see me for a second?

182
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:50,780
Right now?

183
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:14,360
Welcome.

184
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:19,350
♬  With you,  ♬

185
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:26,080
♬  everything seems so easy.  ♬

186
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:27,950
Hello.

187
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:29,850
Sit.

188
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:31,650
♬  With you,  ♬

189
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:34,590
Do you want to eat something? I will order it.

190
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:39,390
♬  I don't care if I´m a little bit crazy  ♬

191
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:53,320
Excuse me, why did you want to see me?

192
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:57,580
First of all, congratulations for getting first place yesterday.

193
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:01,610
Yes, thank you.

194
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:08,340
Joon Hyeong really scolded me yesterday. I went because I was already in the area for some other business.

195
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:12,180
So I stopped by because I wanted to cheer you on at the competition.

196
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:14,430
I guess I stuck my nose where it didn't belong.

197
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:18,200
I'm sorry, Bok Joo.

198
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:23,410
I hope that I didn't

199
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:26,080
hurt your feelings in any way.

200
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:34,100
Now that I think of it, I think I made a lot of mistakes even though that wasn't my intention.

201
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:37,510
I was thoughtless, I'm sorry.

202
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:41,770
It's fine, Doctor. You didn't do anything wrong.

203
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:48,110
It's all because I liked you on my own and did all sorts of things, and even lied.

204
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:50,870
- It's all my fault. 
 - No.

205
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:54,890
I did it out of goodwill, but it could have been misleading.

206
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:58,170
I should have been more careful as an elder.

207
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,980
I am really sorry.

208
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:03,590
No, Doctor. Please don't do that.

209
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:08,490
I always feel a good energy and get excited whenever I see you,

210
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:11,500
so I think that's how I ended up making a mistake.

211
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:16,300
I shouldn't have acted without thinking.

212
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:23,110
Don't feel bad Doctor. Treating someone nice isn't a bad thing.

213
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:27,150
There are so many people who treat others meanly.

214
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:31,540
I'm a "Geum Sa Ba" (Someone that falls in love easily). I fall in love really easily.

215
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:37,450
Then I fall for someone else just as quickly. Even the celebrities I like, today it's Song Joong Gi.

216
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:41,320
Tomorrow maybe Kim Soo Hyun? It always changes every day.

217
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:49,250
It hasn't been long since Joon Hyeong and I reunited, so he probably didn't know that.

218
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:54,850
While I'm training, I get bored and think of other things to distract myself.

219
00:19:54,850 --> 00:20:00,170
But as you saw yesterday, I ended up winning first place.

220
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:03,640
So I'll have to really only focus on training now.

221
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:08,840
Oh, I see.

222
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:13,880
Excuse me. I have another appointment, so...

223
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:17,340
Why do so many people want to see me today? I've become a total star.

224
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:21,110
Oh yes, you should leave then.

225
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:25,650
Oh, this must be expensive. What a waste.

226
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,750
Bok Joo, which way are you going?

227
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:37,270
I'm going this way. How about you?

228
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:39,500
Oh really? I'm going that way too so I'll drop you off.

229
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:44,210
Oh no, It's the opposite way. I have to stop at home for a moment.

230
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:50,300
Then, goodbye. You know that you don't have to be worried at all, right?

231
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,060
Okay then.

232
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:57,830
Goodbye.

233
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:18,670
Hey, Jeong Joon Hyeong!

234
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:22,670
Come see me for a second.

235
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:40,190
Wow, she's giving me goosebumps. She seems really angry.

236
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:46,180
Hey, what's going on? You're totally giving off a scary vibe.

237
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:48,450
Why? What?

238
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:51,150
Why did you say it, to Doctor?

239
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:51,930
What?

240
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:57,300
Why did you tell the doctor that I have a crush on him? Who do you think you are?

241
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,590
I just came from meeting Doctor.

242
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:06,600
He was at his wit's end, apologizing because it seemed like he made a mistake toward me.

243
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:10,780
Do you know how wretched I felt as I watched him act like that?

244
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:14,680
"So if I like someone, then that person has to feel this sorry towards me."

245
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:17,430
"It really makes things difficult for the other person I like because he can't like me back."

246
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:18,690
Hey, why are you going that far?

247
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:20,940
If you had just ignored it, it would have been over and done with!

248
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,960
Why are you making me feel like that?

249
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,900
Who are you to tell someone else how I feel, as you please?

250
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:29,630
Hey, it's not like that. I just...

251
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:33,460
That's right. I went to the waiting room that day. I didn't feel good when I saw you crying.

252
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:37,960
But Hyung showed up with a bouquet of flowers thoughtlessly. So before I knew it,  I dragged him out and lost my temper.

253
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:42,900
Why are you losing your temper? Are you me? Just leave it alone!

254
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:47,790
That's better than the doctor being all at his wit's end because of me. Why do you keep acting however you want to?

255
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:51,930
Was it fun? Was it fun watching me act like an idiot because of your brother?

256
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:53,390
Hey.

257
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:56,950
Do I look like I'm having fun?

258
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:59,820
Do you think that I went along with your lie,

259
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:04,060
spent money to comfort you, and went off on Hyung because I was bored?

260
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:06,950
I wouldn't know since I'm not you.

261
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:12,880
Fine. Lets say that I'm like that. But what about you?

262
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,260
You made first place, but why are you going around like you're the loser?

263
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:19,370
So he saw you at your competition. Is that so embarrassing?

264
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:21,880
I'm asking if you're embarrassed about all the weightlifting that you've done until now!

265
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,500
That is a different problem from this!

266
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:27,060
Either way, you are embarrassed by it.

267
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:30,060
I thought you were really cool when I looked at you from the viewpoint of someone who also does sports.

268
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:32,350
But you aren't cool at all these days.

269
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:36,960
You're that embarrassed about yourself, so who would think you're pretty?

270
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:51,330
You're here? Why is our mercenary acting like that?

271
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:53,650
She seemed really pissed.

272
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,450
Joon Hyeong! Hey!

273
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:04,540
- That's all the appointments for today right?
 - Yes.

274
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:06,700
- Let's start wrapping up. 
 -  Yes.

275
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:11,930
Doctor. She wants alcohol. Since it's been a while, let's go out to eat. Please buy us beer.

276
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:14,240
Alright. I'll buy you a glass.

277
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,960
- Oh, Mr. Joon Hyeong. 
 - Joon Hyeong.

278
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,070
- Are you leaving?

279
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:18,920
- Are you leaving? 
 - Yeah. Do you want to go out to have beers together?

280
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:23,540
I'm sorry butI hope that you could give up Hyung to me today.

281
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:26,030
Of course. We'll just have a drink next time.

282
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:28,440
I will be outside. Come out after you change.

283
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,820
Yeah.

284
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:36,800
It's cold out. You should've waited inside.

285
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:39,340
- Hyung,  you met Bok Joo. 
 - Yes.

286
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:43,190
Yeah. It seemed that I was too friendly.

287
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:47,380
And it felt like going to the competition was a mistake, so I couldn't stay still.

288
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:51,340
- So, you met Bok Joo so you could feel better? 
  - What?

289
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:56,270
That's what it was. Didn't you apologize tp Bok Joo so you could get rid of all the burden you felt in your heart?

290
00:24:56,910 --> 00:25:03,720
That wasn't like that. I'm the elder and I did make a mistake even though it wasn't intentional.

291
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:06,500
I did it because I thought I should convey how sorry I was to her.

292
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:09,210
Did I make a mistake again?

293
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:12,600
Yeah, you made a mistake again.

294
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:16,050
What do you think Bok Joo would have felt seeing you so flustered because of her?

295
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:19,350
Do you think that she would have felt better because you apologized to her?

296
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:25,880
Why do you never realize that your excessive consideration can hurt others?

297
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,250
You were like that long ago too.

298
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:31,170
From the time I came to live with you, you were always too considerate of me.

299
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:35,530
Even if I messed up your stuff or used the spare key to steal your car and got it scratched,

300
00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:37,850
you never got mad at me even once.

301
00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:41,670
My friends were probably envious when they saw that I had a hyung like you.

302
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:46,290
But, that made me sad for some reason.

303
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:54,060
"Ah, so he's doing that because I'm not his real younger brother."

304
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:59,380
"So I'm just a stranger that's living protected in this house." That's what I thought.

305
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:03,510
- Joon Hyeong.  
 -I know. You didn't  have that intention.

306
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:06,020
You probably had a really hard time conceding to me and being considerate of me.

307
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:09,980
But, I would have preferred for you

308
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:15,090
to get mad at me and hit me like other older brothers do!

309
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:17,360
I wanted that from you.

310
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:27,070
I'm going.

311
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:35,250


312
00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:40,210
Why are you all like this, huh?

313
00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:44,080
Hey. Did you all get together and eat something yesterday?

314
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:47,840
- Why can't you get a hold of yourselves? 
  - I'm sorry.

315
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:51,290
Stay back until you work off all the weight you gained.

316
00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:53,290
Next.

317
00:26:57,170 --> 00:26:59,400
You decreased 0.3 less than yesterday.

318
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:04,450
If you keep going like this, you can get back to your old weight. Let's lose it all before the competition.

319
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:06,980
The championship match is right around the corner. You know, right?

320
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:08,740
I understand.

321
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:10,500
Then next.

322
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:17,010
Eat this.

323
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:20,320
Oh? Thank you.

324
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:25,820
Is it really okay for you to eat all of these?

325
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:31,580
Yeah. I'll eat and run ten laps around the sports field. I'll spend three hours in the sauna, too.

326
00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:34,480
Eat slowly, then. Chew thoroughly.

327
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,130
Yeah.

328
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,160
Wait a moment.

329
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:59,140
Are you okay? Don't you have indigestion?

330
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:01,230
I'll go and buy you some medicine real quick.

331
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:08,280
Aren't you annoyed with me? I've been doing what I wanted and acting so fickle since earlier.

332
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:14,620
We ordered so much food too because I insisted. Why are you putting up with all that?

333
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:19,620
Because I like you.

334
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:26,100
I've liked you ever since my freshman year.

335
00:28:27,410 --> 00:28:30,730
Stay here. I will quickly go buy it.

336
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:38,520
  Husband &amp; Wife Pharmacy  

337
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:56,720
What are you doing instead of coming out? Are you meditating or something?

338
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:59,440
No, I'm about to go in now.

339
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:01,910
Go in first.

340
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:33,450
Ah, Weightlifter Kim! What time is it now, but you're still sleeping? Get up!

341
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:36,880
Bok Joo, let's go to the cafeteria. This unni will buy you some sausage.

342
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,760
Forget it. I don't want to eat.

343
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,430
Does that make any sense?

344
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:43,940
You didn't even breakfast, so how could you not want to eat sausage?

345
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:46,680
Ah, Weightlifter Kim. Get up!

346
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,840
Stop annoying me. Leave me alone so I can sleep.

347
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:52,900
Are you Sleeping Beauty or something? Why are you sleeping so much?

348
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:56,650
Hey, let's just leave her alone. She must have been exhausted from working so hard for the competition.

349
00:30:56,650 --> 00:31:00,510
Wait, is she the only one who was in a competition? Why is she so exhausted?

350
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:05,690
Kim Bok Joo. When you wake up, you'd better be cheerful again like your old self.

351
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:09,150
Aish, really! You are no fun at all!

352
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:20,480
Aigoo, I want to understand but I really can't.

353
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:25,070
You're supposed to feel refreshed after you finish a competition. What's with the aftereffects? In addition, she's even placed first.

354
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:27,080
That's what I'm saying.

355
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:30,580
But Bok Joo's weight gain process was quite a spectacle.

356
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:33,470
I don't really know the feeling, but she may feel a bit dejected.

357
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:38,120
I don't know. I wouldn't know. I would have to have made first place to know.

358
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:41,770
Oh, hello.

359
00:31:41,770 --> 00:31:44,240
It's that guy Tae Gwon!

360
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:47,660
- Hey, why'd you call him, so it'll be noisy?
- Why? He's nice.

361
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:51,410
The more I see him, the cuter he gets. If I can't get a boyfriend by the end of the year,

362
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:56,000
I'm going to seduce Tae Gwon and make him my man!

363
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,870
I'm telling you that's what happened!

364
00:31:57,870 --> 00:32:00,000
- Really?
 - Yeah.

365
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,170
Really, Bok Joo went inside the swimming team locker room and dragged Joon Hyeong outside?

366
00:32:03,170 --> 00:32:05,610
Yeah.

367
00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:07,790
Oh, you two didn't know.

368
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:12,140
The mood was super deadly. Since then, Jeong Joon Hyeong has also been under the weather.

369
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:15,210
So I guess something really did happen between those two.

370
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:18,740
- What would warrant something like that in their relationship?
 - Hey, it's obvious.

371
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:22,190
I knew that a day like this would come someday.

372
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:28,740
Whether you're a man or a woman, when two people spend a lot of time together, you definitely end up crossing the line like this.

373
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:34,600
Jeong Joon Hyeong must have teased her a ton by calling her Fatty or whatever.

374
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:40,220
I advised him to take it easy so many times, but he always looked so carefree with our Mercenary.

375
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:44,890
- I was shocked. You were talking about crossing line.
 - I thought you were talking about...

376
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:51,590
It's not possible for something like that to happen, not even to the slightest degree. Not at all!

377
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:56,940
Our Joon Hyeong has a kind of immature side, so he pays attention to a girl's face.

378
00:32:56,940 --> 00:33:00,710
Then, what about you, Tae Gwon? Where do you look when you see a woman?

379
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:04,010
For me, I-I look at the f-face.

380
00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:06,420
The face?

381
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:09,620
- Oh! Hello, Professor!
 - Hello, Professor!

382
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:13,640
- Did he not see us?
 - He seems a little out of it.

383
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,080
He's walking super fast.

384
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:18,870
What do you mean? Does that make sense?

385
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:23,740
According to our Joo Yeon, Coach Choi called her and made a request.

386
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:26,730
She asked us to pay in advance for operating expenses!

387
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:29,650
I-Is that true?

388
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:32,640
Yes. She did.

389
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:44,150
Oh, Coach Choi! It's good you came! Come here.

390
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:46,940
It's good you came. Tell him.

391
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:50,940
This man is telling some ridiculous story that you took the money for operating expenses and used it.

392
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:54,450
It's true. I did.

393
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:55,460
What?

394
00:33:55,460 --> 00:34:00,810
I had some personal circumstances. I'm sorry.

395
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:11,010
What personal problems? What in the world is so urgent

396
00:34:11,010 --> 00:34:14,050
that you would take the operation money and use it?

397
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:15,780
I'm sorry.

398
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:18,500
Coach Choi.

399
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:25,330
- Press down a bit.
 - Right here.

400
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:29,540
- Lift.
 - One, two.

401
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:41,140
Captain! How long are we going to stretch? It's already ten minutes past time to start training.

402
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:43,320
Why aren't Professor and Coach coming?

403
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:46,160
- Woon Gi, did you get informed anything separately? 
 - No.

404
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:49,120
- I'll give them a call.
 - Okay.

405
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:53,240
- Hello.
 - Oh, hello!

406
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:55,640
Woon Gi, I think you'll have to conduct the training today.

407
00:34:55,640 --> 00:35:00,160
Repeat each set four times like you did yesterday. Got it?

408
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:05,500
Wow. Professor's face is totally ashen. What's wrong with him?

409
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:08,950
I know, right? His mood was really cold.

410
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:10,660
Where did Coach go as well?

411
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:15,350
Ah, that's right! Earlier, we saw Professor with a deadly pale face running to the main ofiice.

412
00:35:15,350 --> 00:35:16,800
- To the main office?
 - Why did he go to the main office?

413
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,650
- You said he went to the main office?
 - Why, why, why?

414
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:22,460
- He really turned ghostly pale .
 - Something must have happened.

415
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:24,410
Why did he go there?

416
00:35:24,410 --> 00:35:27,920
Hey, shut up! What are you doing? You heard what Professor said, right?

417
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,820
Repeat each set four times like you did yesterday.

418
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:32,560
- Start!
 - Yes!

419
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:35,840
- Move quickly!
 - Why did he go to the main office?

420
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:42,200
I'm sure there must be an inevitable reason for it, Academy Director.

421
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:45,170
Please take a proper step to reconsider it.

422
00:35:45,170 --> 00:35:48,820
No, she's not the kind of person to embezzle public funds for private use.

423
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:54,050
It's not even ₩300,000, but ₩3,000,000. It just doesn't make sense.

424
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:59,860
Coach.

425
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:04,500
Oh? Hey, why are you out here instead of training, Woon Gi?

426
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:08,740
From where did you get my settlement money?

427
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:10,390
There's no need for you to know.

428
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:14,120
I heard that a problem arose because of the money for the operation expenses.

429
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:16,990
I heard Professor on the phone.

430
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,360
Is it really the operation expense money?

431
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:25,390
Coach, did you use the operation expense money because of me?

432
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:26,260
Hey, Woon Gi—

433
00:36:26,270 --> 00:36:32,350
If I had known that money was for the operation expenses,  I wouldn't have accepted it even if I had to go to jail.

434
00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:37,860
- I'll go to the main office and tell them.
 - Hey, Jeong Woon Gi, stop there.

435
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:40,440
Even if you went, nothing would change.

436
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:43,060
Either way, it's true that I embezzled public funds.

437
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:46,260
That's my fault. You just pretend that you don't know.

438
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:49,290
How could I pretend not to know when this all happened because of me?

439
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:53,100
I made the decision, so you don't act rashly but stay still.

440
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:58,850
If you act as you please even though I told you this, then I won't see you again.

441
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:24,280
 Hyung, why do you never 

442
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:29,690
 realize that your excessive consideration can hurt others? 

443
00:37:40,330 --> 00:37:43,100
 Hyung Jae Yi 

444
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:52,330
Yes, Mom.

445
00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:54,040
- Be careful.
 - Why? Why?

446
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:56,670
- I'm here! 
 - Oh, come in.

447
00:37:56,670 --> 00:38:00,430
You're here? What are you doing? Hurry up and help out with this.

448
00:38:00,430 --> 00:38:02,870
Aigoo, but why are you suddenly doing a big cleanup?

449
00:38:02,870 --> 00:38:06,560
Your mom has been wanting to do it for a while, so she suggested we do it before it gets colder.

450
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,460
Honey, you can leave now.

451
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:12,310
Let them do it. Go rest your body. Didn't you say your back was hurting?

452
00:38:12,310 --> 00:38:14,570
Sh-should I?

453
00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:18,960
I'll leave it to you, my sons! Work hard. We'll get the medicine together.

454
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,790
- Work hard.
 - Yes, please go ahead!

455
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:29,860
- How do we move this?
- Set it into the bottom over there.

456
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:35,340
I ended up using the muscles I gained from doing sports on something like this.

457
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:39,470
You worked hard.

458
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:45,680
No, well. It wasn't hard work.

459
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:51,210
Do you want to play a game of catch so you can use those athletic muscles properly?

460
00:39:27,110 --> 00:39:30,210
The glove is too small. It's the one that I used a long time ago.

461
00:39:30,210 --> 00:39:32,920
I know, so just throw. Stop making excuses.

462
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,680
I'm going!

463
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:40,910
Hyung!

464
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:43,420
Hyung, are you all right?

465
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:47,760
What are you doing right now? Something really bad almost happened!

466
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,660
Hey, you do sports, yet that's as good as you can throw?

467
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:53,770
You threw the ball with your grudge, right?

468
00:39:53,770 --> 00:39:55,660
Do you wish to die?

469
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,190
Is that good enough?

470
00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:09,400
Do I seem like a real big brother now?

471
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:12,240
Hey, what the heck?!

472
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:18,240
You surprised me!

473
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:28,140
I never imagined that being good to you could make you feel more distant from me—not even in my dreams.

474
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:31,160
Ah. Do I really have a disease?

475
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:36,200
Why would you go so far as to call it a disease? I may have been a little oversensitive, too.

476
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,820
Anyway, I'm sorry.

477
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:41,870
Don't do that. You make me into a bad person if you do this.

478
00:40:41,870 --> 00:40:44,290
Who is the person who's really sorry here?

479
00:40:44,290 --> 00:40:47,490
I was just throwing a tantrum even though you treated me well, because I was just too comfortable.

480
00:40:47,490 --> 00:40:53,760
But you're really scary when you get mad. I thought you were going to punch me.

481
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:58,670
Of course, I'm a younger brother who only butters up Hyung. Originally, I'm tough.

482
00:40:58,670 --> 00:41:01,540
I'm not too sure about that.

483
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:06,610
Either way, looking at how someone who's not interested in other people's business got that angry,

484
00:41:06,610 --> 00:41:10,790
that friend Bok Joo must be a really special friend to you.

485
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:21,470
What do you mean, special? It's because I pitied her for having a first love at her age.

486
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:40,160
That's right. Let's really not care about it from now on! She told me, herself!

487
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:44,380
Okay. It stops right here, Kim Bok Joo. It's the end!

488
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:47,060
It's the end, Kim Bok Joo!

489
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:50,250
The end!

490
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:58,690
What's with the girl's ankle? It's not like you colored it.

491
00:41:58,690 --> 00:42:01,630
It's purple here, and green there—

492
00:42:01,630 --> 00:42:04,580
Do you want to have all 36 colors?

493
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:08,350
But you seem more comfortable today?

494
00:42:08,350 --> 00:42:10,820
Was there a change in your love?

495
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:12,690
You could be a mind-reader.

496
00:42:12,690 --> 00:42:16,570
Why? Am I right? You face a new situation now?

497
00:42:16,570 --> 00:42:19,180
I got tired of obsessing over him.

498
00:42:19,950 --> 00:42:23,900
I also wonder if I should just lean on someone who likes me as well.

499
00:42:23,950 --> 00:42:26,670
I'm for that. It's good to love,

500
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:30,640
but you need to receive love so you can gain some confidence.

501
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:34,080
Wait. Wait.

502
00:42:35,130 --> 00:42:37,300
Oh, it's not working!

503
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:40,050
- Oh, oh, oh.  
 - Wait a moment.

504
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,690
What the heck? You said that you're good at skating.

505
00:42:45,690 --> 00:42:49,350
Ah, is it because I haven't done it in a long time? My old skill hasn't shown up yet.

506
00:42:49,350 --> 00:42:51,790
Wait. I need to take a break.

507
00:42:51,790 --> 00:42:54,450
Be careful. Be careful.

508
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:03,810
Open it here first.

509
00:43:03,810 --> 00:43:06,200
Like this.

510
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:28,340
Sorry. I'm really sorry.

511
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:30,120
It's okay.

512
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:32,570
I also know.

513
00:43:32,570 --> 00:43:34,570
I know that you don't feel that way.

514
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:39,660
But Song Si Ho, using me is alright.

515
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:42,940
I hope that you'll stop mistreating yourself.

516
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:46,360
I'll go first.

517
00:43:51,910 --> 00:43:57,460
What's going on for you to wait outside my house to have a drink with me, Jeong Jae Yi?

518
00:43:57,460 --> 00:44:00,670
You weren't possibly told that you have a terminal illness or something, right?

519
00:44:00,670 --> 00:44:03,410
Write a novel.

520
00:44:03,410 --> 00:44:05,510
Right, who cares about what?

521
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:10,620
I'll revive the drunken frenzy during the intern time completely today. So get ready.

522
00:44:10,620 --> 00:44:16,580
Ah Yeong. Is there a problem with my personality from your viewpoint, too?

523
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:19,030
What are you talking about so randomly?

524
00:44:19,030 --> 00:44:25,610
Someone said that my acts of consideration could hurt others.

525
00:44:25,610 --> 00:44:30,880
They said that me treating others well could actually create a distance between us.

526
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:33,570
They were right, even though I don't know who it is.

527
00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:35,750
Really?

528
00:44:35,750 --> 00:44:40,510
To be honest, you're really friendly and courteous,

529
00:44:40,510 --> 00:44:44,540
but there are times when it does feel like you're drawing a line between us.

530
00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:48,450
There are also times when I get upset because I feel like I'm really not that close to you.

531
00:44:48,450 --> 00:44:52,130
You should have told me earlier. I didn't even realize it.

532
00:44:52,130 --> 00:44:56,860
I thought that you knew. So you didn't know. So it's possible for you not to realize it.

533
00:44:56,860 --> 00:45:00,180
- When were you upset?
 - There's something like that. No comment.

534
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:04,630
You should tell me since we're talking about it. I'm planning on fixing it.

535
00:45:09,470 --> 00:45:11,540
Wait a moment.

536
00:45:12,490 --> 00:45:14,400
Yeah, Sunbae Sang Heun.

537
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:18,190
Ah, really? I got it. I'll look into it. Okay.

538
00:45:20,140 --> 00:45:24,260
Sunbae Sang Heun and  Dong Won will meet Sunbae Sang Go.

539
00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:28,800
I heard that he came to Korea, but I guess he wasn't just staying for a short while.

540
00:45:29,950 --> 00:45:32,680
Did Hwan Yi come with him too?

541
00:45:33,690 --> 00:45:38,430
How about going with me and seeing that good-looking face together?

542
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:45,450
- Hey, did you go out and have some fun yesterday?
 - No, I didn't

543
00:45:45,450 --> 00:45:47,010
Then why are you smiling so much?

544
00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:50,300
- I've always been the excitable type.
 - You're crazy.

545
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:54,150
Hey, hey! It's the Weightlifting Three Musketeers.

546
00:45:54,150 --> 00:45:55,740
Don't do it.

547
00:45:55,770 --> 00:45:59,860
You still didn't make up with that Mercenary yet? Hey, just go and beg her, punk.

548
00:45:59,860 --> 00:46:03,530
Shut up. Don't connect me with her from now on.

549
00:46:04,170 --> 00:46:07,560
Hey! Hey, Jeong Joon Hyeong! Hey—

550
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:08,800
Why's he acting like that?

551
00:46:08,870 --> 00:46:12,630
What the heck are you saying? Coach has been terminated?

552
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:14,260
According to a person I know from the financial aid department,

553
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:18,100
the problem is that Coach got the operation expense money in advance and used it privately.

554
00:46:18,110 --> 00:46:19,320
So she got terminated.

555
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:20,630
Wow, awesome.

556
00:46:20,630 --> 00:46:21,990
No way!

557
00:46:21,990 --> 00:46:23,940
How could our coach do that?

558
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:25,230
Is it true, Sunbae?

559
00:46:25,230 --> 00:46:29,410
Probably, it's true. That's why Professor ran around with a deadly pale face.

560
00:46:29,410 --> 00:46:32,330
There's no way she did that. Our coach isn't that kind of person.

561
00:46:32,330 --> 00:46:35,610
- I clearly heard about it yesterday.
 - Me, too.

562
00:46:35,610 --> 00:46:39,220
I heard it that way too.

563
00:46:39,790 --> 00:46:41,510
Hello!

564
00:46:41,510 --> 00:46:43,420
Why are you all gathered together?

565
00:46:46,550 --> 00:46:50,080
Captain, we don't have the training of  Clean &amp; Jerk and Snatch today.

566
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:53,050
But let each of you do weight training in the weight room.

567
00:46:53,050 --> 00:46:55,250
You lead them.

568
00:47:09,580 --> 00:47:12,780
Coach, it's not true, right? This is just some ridiculous rumor, right?

569
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:16,130
I'm sorry.

570
00:47:21,060 --> 00:47:26,200
What the heck? Apologizing means that Coach is acknowledging it too.

571
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:30,110
- Completely shocking.
 - Hey, let's do weight training.

572
00:47:30,110 --> 00:47:34,420
Hey! Wait, Coach isn't that kind of person!

573
00:47:36,580 --> 00:47:40,640
I tried to stop you from being terminated. I'm sorry.

574
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:45,300
No. It's all my fault.

575
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:48,220
Let me ask you one last time.

576
00:47:48,220 --> 00:47:50,840
What did you use that money for?

577
00:47:51,750 --> 00:47:56,420
At least, I should know where you used it so I can petition to reconsider your circumstance.

578
00:47:56,420 --> 00:48:00,920
It's all my fault, no matter what. Please don't worry yourself over it, Professor.

579
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:08,530
It's because of me, Professor.

580
00:48:08,530 --> 00:48:12,500
The coach used the money from our operation expenses to pay my settlement fee.

581
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:14,800
Hey, Bang Woon Gi.

582
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,970
We're closed for the day. Oh, Professor.

583
00:48:21,970 --> 00:48:25,490
- Hyung! 
 - What is it?

584
00:48:25,490 --> 00:48:30,070
Oh? Why are you here this late at night? Is something wrong?

585
00:48:30,070 --> 00:48:34,230
It looks like Coach Choi is going to get fired.

586
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:40,060
She decided to solve the problem first, so she used the money because she would get the money from someplace else soon.

587
00:48:40,060 --> 00:48:42,330
But things turned out like this...

588
00:48:42,450 --> 00:48:47,420
About the extenuating circumstances, I have to tell the truth.

589
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:50,660
If I do so, he will get a disciplinary punishment.

590
00:48:50,660 --> 00:48:55,260
If I don't do anything, then I feel so bad for Coach Choi.

591
00:48:55,290 --> 00:48:58,150
By the way, Coach Choi told me even not to worry about her.

592
00:48:59,590 --> 00:49:03,230
She said she couldn't tell me the truth because she thought I would be worried.

593
00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:07,460
Oh, this woman.

594
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:09,850
Why is she so cool?

595
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:41,750
Coach!

596
00:49:41,750 --> 00:49:44,960
- Coach!
 - Are you really leaving?

597
00:49:48,670 --> 00:49:51,540
I'm really sorry.

598
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:03,030
Ah. Ah, seriously.

599
00:50:04,110 --> 00:50:09,780
Do training diligently. Don't slack off with the excuse of this atmosphere.

600
00:50:11,870 --> 00:50:13,350
I'm going.

601
00:50:13,350 --> 00:50:15,800
- Coach!
 - Don't come out. I'll leave by myself.

602
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:17,300
Hurry up and practice.

603
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:19,470
You guys are slacking off.

604
00:50:19,470 --> 00:50:21,980
Weightlifting, fighting!

605
00:50:31,490 --> 00:50:33,690
Coach!

606
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:38,240
Bok Joo, I told you not to come out so why did you come?

607
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:41,200
It's not that. Coach wouldn't do something like that!

608
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:45,380
There's been a misunderstanding somewhere. It's not true, right Coach?

609
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:47,850
I'm really sorry.

610
00:50:49,330 --> 00:50:51,950
Then who will I train with from now on?

611
00:50:51,950 --> 00:50:58,330
Coach, you are in charge of me. You worked hard to raise my weight class. Now, who do I believe in and how can I be trained?

612
00:50:58,330 --> 00:51:00,860
This is not it, seriously!

613
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:05,990
You said to let's go together! Why are you leaving alone like this?

614
00:51:07,810 --> 00:51:08,960
Go inside.

615
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:12,160
Coach!

616
00:51:12,220 --> 00:51:14,660
Coach!

617
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:20,990
Coach!

618
00:51:25,930 --> 00:51:27,590
Coach...

619
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:40,230
Here, get on.

620
00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:42,190
It's okay. I can just take a taxi.

621
00:51:42,190 --> 00:51:45,120
Hey, hey. Just listen to me, okay?

622
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:48,610
How is a woman not obedient, even a little bit, huh?

623
00:51:48,650 --> 00:51:53,280
So how about it? Shall we enjoy some speed?

624
00:52:11,170 --> 00:52:13,050
This isn't right.

625
00:52:14,870 --> 00:52:17,520
This is not it. The picture is not this.

626
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:19,980
A bit slowly...

627
00:52:44,550 --> 00:52:46,640
Hey, Woon Gi!

628
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:47,720
Hey, Bang Woon Gi!

629
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:49,470
What's wrong, Woon Gi!

630
00:52:49,470 --> 00:52:51,440
Hey!

631
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:54,740
Leave. Let's go out, guys.

632
00:52:54,740 --> 00:52:57,760
- What is this?
 - Hey, Woon Gi!

633
00:52:59,660 --> 00:53:01,460
 Choi Seong Eun 

634
00:53:08,150 --> 00:53:10,570
Coach.

635
00:53:19,870 --> 00:53:23,360
Coach.

636
00:53:30,310 --> 00:53:33,470
  Haneul Sports University.   

637
00:53:41,180 --> 00:53:43,380
Um...

638
00:53:45,730 --> 00:53:51,630
Later, you know that we have an appointment with the sponsor?

639
00:53:53,010 --> 00:53:58,130
A bit later, let's go to the main building together.

640
00:53:58,170 --> 00:54:00,520
Yes.

641
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:04,930
Why are we meeting on the weekend? My part-time shift starts soon.

642
00:55:04,930 --> 00:55:09,240
Are you sure the coach is mad cause of that jerk Gi Seok?

643
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:13,620
Yes! There was freshman training yesterday but that brat didn't show up.

644
00:55:13,620 --> 00:55:17,710
That's why Coach called everyone in.

645
00:55:17,710 --> 00:55:19,950
Excuse me, did you see Bok Joo?

646
00:55:19,950 --> 00:55:22,790
Mercenary? I haven't seen her. Why?

647
00:55:22,790 --> 00:55:26,460
We have a meeting with a sponsor but Bok Joo suddenly disappeared.

648
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:28,660
Disappeared? Did something happen?

649
00:55:28,660 --> 00:55:32,660
Our coach got fired today. She must be upset because she was close to her.

650
00:55:32,660 --> 00:55:35,030
Ah, but it's not right for her to disappear without any plans like this.

651
00:55:35,030 --> 00:55:37,740
I told you that she's been weird lately. All she does is sleep.

652
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:40,500
Let's go to the Weightlifting Room again. She might have gone that way.

653
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:42,900
We are going to go.

654
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:46,590
What is happening?

655
00:55:46,590 --> 00:55:49,890
Mercenary is doing all sorts of things, seriously!

656
00:55:57,540 --> 00:56:00,940
We are late. Hurry up!

657
00:56:05,010 --> 00:56:07,570
Where are you going? We are late.

658
00:56:19,060 --> 00:56:26,450
♬   How can I get your love   ♬

659
00:56:26,450 --> 00:56:32,950
♬   How can I make you smile  ♬

660
00:56:32,950 --> 00:56:35,360
Hyung! Hyung!

661
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:37,370
Did Bok Joo possibly come here? Bok Joo?

662
00:56:37,370 --> 00:56:39,830
Bok Joo? No, she didn't come.

663
00:56:39,830 --> 00:56:41,960
Then where did she go?

664
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:45,510
Why? Did something happen to Bok Joo?

665
00:56:45,510 --> 00:56:48,690
No, just. I'm going.

666
00:56:48,690 --> 00:56:51,950
See you in the morning.

667
00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:53,770
Hey.

668
00:56:56,380 --> 00:56:59,530
Ah, that surprised me!

669
00:56:59,530 --> 00:57:02,930
Student, what are you doing here?

670
00:57:02,930 --> 00:57:05,460
Why are you lying down here even when the sun is down?

671
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:09,010
What if you freeze to death like this? Hurry and go!

672
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:10,710
I'm sorry. 
 ♬   Will you come to me,  you and I in my dream. 

673
00:57:10,710 --> 00:57:22,370
♬   Will you come to me,  you and I in my dream.  ♬

674
00:57:23,580 --> 00:57:27,850
♬   You and I  ♬

675
00:57:33,930 --> 00:57:35,620
Hey, what are you?

676
00:57:35,620 --> 00:57:38,230
Where were you that you're just now showing up?!

677
00:57:38,230 --> 00:57:41,470
Hey, do you know how much your friends and everyone where looking for you? Why did you cut off your phone?

678
00:57:41,470 --> 00:57:45,840
Are you in puberty right now? Were you hiding to make others worry intentionally or what?

679
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:49,340
What are you doing immaturely!

680
00:57:50,370 --> 00:57:53,000
Why do you make someone so worried about you?

681
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:57,560
Why do you make my heart clench with worry that I did something wrong?

682
00:57:57,560 --> 00:58:00,500
Why do you make me worry about you, Kim Bok Joo?

683
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:04,870
Joon Hyeong.

684
00:58:06,180 --> 00:58:08,240
I'm weird.

685
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:11,530
I think I'm sick, no matter how I think.

686
00:58:11,530 --> 00:58:16,170
I don't want to do anything and I, even more, don't want to weight lift.

687
00:58:16,170 --> 00:58:18,510
It's strange I'm always sleepy.

688
00:58:18,510 --> 00:58:21,740
I don't have any strength.

689
00:58:23,550 --> 00:58:25,550
Bok Joo.

690
00:58:25,550 --> 00:58:28,690
I think something is wrong.

691
00:58:28,690 --> 00:58:31,840
My heart feels its stuffed full.

692
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:37,240
It's really frustrating and I'm constantly sad.

693
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:40,660
What should I do now?

694
00:59:23,090 --> 00:59:27,300
