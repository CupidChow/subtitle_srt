1
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,760


2
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,340
If you go this way, the swimming pool will appear.

3
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:36,280
Thank you.

4
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:45,100
Joon Hyeong!

5
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:47,670
Bok Joo!

6
00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:59,740
Joon Hyeong...

7
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,920
Do you recognize me?

8
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:15,940
It's me. It's Mom.

9
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:38,600
Are you really my Joon Hyeong?

10
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,590
My goodness.

11
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:45,330
I really wondered

12
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:49,610
how you grew up.

13
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:58,830
You grew up better than I thought.

14
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:24,940
Do you think Joon Hyeong met his mom yet?

15
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:29,160
I guess so. She said she'd go to the school today.

16
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,930
Honey, you don't think she'll mention the postcards, right?

17
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:33,700
She begged us so earnestly.

18
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:38,790
Is Joon Hyeong's mom a fool? Why would she mention that? It'll just hurt Joon Hyeong's heart.

19
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:41,810
I wonder whether she'll even recognize his face.

20
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:51,110
I asked her because I didn't know where anything was,

21
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:56,650
but how can that student turn out to be your friend?

22
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,750
Are you guys really close?

23
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,270
Yes.

24
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:08,280
What about food? If you're hungry, we can go out and—

25
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:12,970
No, I... I'm not hungry.

26
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:23,840
Is swimming hard?

27
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,700
Can you handle it?

28
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,190
Yes, I guess.

29
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:39,990
I brought this to give it to you.

30
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:42,390
I didn't know what you needed.

31
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:47,930
Since you exercise, I thought maybe you needed some athletic shoes.

32
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:54,590
I'm not sure if the size would fit. I bought it with a rough guess.

33
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:02,450
Thank you.

34
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:05,660
I'll wear them well.

35
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:13,060
As I bought these, I thought of you a lot.

36
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:21,190
I wonder how tall you grew, how your face changed.

37
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,510
I'm sorry, Joon Hyeong.

38
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,850
I should've come to see you earlier.

39
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:40,740
I was so busy living.

40
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,200
Okay.

41
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:58,480
Yes, Mom?

42
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:06,140
 Episode 15
That's How You Become an Adult 

43
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:11,620
I prepared this so suddenly. I'm not sure if it will fit your taste.

44
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:16,020
It's delicious. You have always been a great cook.

45
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:21,540
No, she's not. Her food has become saltier each day she gets older.

46
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:25,240
Father, you should consider a storm to come afterward.

47
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,410
The croaker is really good today.

48
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,730
You really picked a good one!

49
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:34,460
Thank you.

50
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:40,050
Mom, can I have some water?

51
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:42,060
Yeah.

52
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,310
I...

53
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:53,640
You can give it to him.

54
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:56,100
Okay, Sister-in-law.

55
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,840
Here, Joon Hyeong.

56
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,650
Are you okay?

57
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:09,940
Yes. Thank you.

58
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:21,960
I can get a taxi by myself.

59
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,340
Get in, quickly. It's cold.

60
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:02,050
Okay.

61
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:10,110
Joon Hyeong. Do you want to come over to where I'm staying tomorrow?

62
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:16,440
Before I leave, I want to feed you a meal that I make with my hands.

63
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:20,240
If you don't have any time—

64
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,640
I'll go after my training.

65
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,200
Can I have your phone number?

66
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,050
Okay.

67
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,820
See you tomorrow, Son.

68
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:43,740
Go safely.

69
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:17,290
You came?

70
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:21,460
Seeing your expression, you seem happy. Did the meeting with your mom go well?

71
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:25,150
Is it something that would go well or not?

72
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:29,540
No. Your expression looks better than before.

73
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:31,020
Is it obvious?

74
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:35,740
Yes. It's totally obvious.

75
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:38,120
What did you do today with your mom?

76
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:46,290
I just went home and had dinner with Mom. And I went to the main street with her and got a taxi for her.

77
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,490
That's it?

78
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:53,590
Also, I'm going to meet her tomorrow at her place.

79
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:55,150
And?

80
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:04,590
I held her hand like this, and her hand was really warm.

81
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:10,660
I'm about to get jealous but I'm holding it this time because she's your mom.

82
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:14,560
It seems like your mom missed you a lot, too.

83
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,600
She came all the way from Canada to see you.

84
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,440
Of course.

85
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:24,110
How can she not miss her super handsome son?

86
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:29,590
You got some strength on your shoulders since you've seen your mom!

87
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:39,430
I'd be losing if I was jealous, but I wish I also had a mother who came to visit me in school.

88
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:42,170
♬  I dream of it  ♬

89
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:49,660
Hey! Instead, you have a trustworthy dad and a fun uncle. 
♬  Please let us be eternally happy  ♬

90
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:52,560
Also, you have the most precious and important me.

91
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:57,320
♬  I dream of it.  Please let the days we smile be more   ♬

92
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:00,380
You're right. I have you.

93
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:07,110
♬  than the days drenched in tears  ♬

94
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:21,440
Spring Residence No. 1803?

95
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,780
I'm going out right now, so it'll probably take about 30 minutes.

96
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:28,690
Okay. Come safely.

97
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:34,150
Oh, Joon Hyeong. If you have any photo albums, can you bring them?

98
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:38,740
I want to see some pictures of when you were younger.

99
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:41,170
I'll stop by home and bring them.

100
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:43,680
Okay. See you soon.

101
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,860
Oh, they're small.

102
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:10,400
I'll just make my feet fit in them, then.

103
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:21,660
I put  $10, 000 in your account, Mom.

104
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:27,520
Alright. If you add what you have to mine, it makes about $20, 000.

105
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,820
Thank you. You probably also have a lot of things that you need to pay out for.

106
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:34,290
No. It's not money that I'll be using right away anyway.

107
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:37,260
But did she say that the child is in really bad condition?

108
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:40,780
If she gets the money and goes back to Canada, then is it possible for that child to get surgery right away?

109
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:46,720
I'm not sure, since her first priority is to get the money for the surgery.

110
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:52,190
How did the poor child who she bore in her late years get such a rare disease...

111
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:55,710
It seems like she came here because she was depending on her older brother's help,

112
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:59,490
but land isn't something that can be sold right away.

113
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:03,170
Would she have asked us for money if it wasn't that bad?

114
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:05,080
What money?

115
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:10,290
J-Joon Hyeong.

116
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:13,350
When did you come here, you rascal? You didn't even give us any notice.

117
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:15,880
What do you mean, money?

118
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,740
What are you talking about?

119
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:20,860
Joon Hyeong, sit down. Sit down and...

120
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:26,180
Did Mom come because of money? Was it because she needed money?

121
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:28,270
Is that why she suddenly...

122
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:35,070
But then, why is she asking you and Uncle for it?

123
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:38,890
She should be so grateful that you're the ones who raised me and fed me up until now.

124
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:44,090
How could she? How could she be so shameless as to ask you and Uncle something like that?

125
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:47,630
Joon Hyeong, that's not it. It's because she has some personal circumstances.

126
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:51,940
No, it doesn't matter if she has personal circumstances! This isn't right.

127
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:54,220
She's way too brazen.

128
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:58,780
How could a person who never got in touch with us for ten years

129
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:02,550
do something like that? How?

130
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:07,310
I knew everything.

131
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:10,670
The postcards that I got every year and the presents...

132
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:13,350
You're the one who sent them, Aunt.

133
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:20,740
You should have just told me the truth. How long do I have to pretend not to know?

134
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:23,700
When do I have to stop putting on this act?

135
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:28,850
I felt so ashamed because I saw how much you were enduring and how much effort you were putting into it.

136
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:33,650
So why would you give her that money? Why? What? Do you think I'm pitiful? If that's not it,

137
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:38,790
then do you think that since you've already paid so much raising me until now,  you're making a donation one more time?

138
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:43,940
Is it because you want to pretend to be a good person until the end? Is that what it is?

139
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:50,550
That's right! I did it because I wanted to go to heaven.

140
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:53,440
That's why I raised you with that kind of heart. Are you satisfied?

141
00:13:55,660 --> 00:14:00,510
You rude little boy! How could you say something so mean?

142
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:04,650
I... Oh, you mean child!

143
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:06,340
Joon Hyeong!

144
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:14,490
Hey, Kim Bok Joo! You're not practicing hard.

145
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:19,290
Why do you still keep wrapping with bandages? Are you a mummy?

146
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:22,580
- No, I'll get started right away.
- You little rascal.

147
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,600
You're slacking off just because you did well at one competition.

148
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:28,320
If you're going to be like that, then just quit, you rascal! Go to Taereung (Korean national training center)!

149
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:33,670
Taereung wants you to come to them, you rascal.

150
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:36,340
Go to Taereung now, you little rascal!

151
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:38,560
KWF (Korea Weightlifting Federation) came to an agreement and made the decision today.

152
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:42,780
You rascal, you have to be admitted by this weekend!

153
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:44,360
What?

154
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:50,300
Daily Sports will come for an interview tomorrow.

155
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:55,360
They'll come to find out the secret of how we did well in the last competition.

156
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:00,940
Thank you so much! Thank you, thank you. Thank you!

157
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:03,280
Oh, this rascal! I...

158
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,960
What is this?

159
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:13,600
- Kim Bok Joo, fighting!
 - Fighting!

160
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,590
You've got a delivery.

161
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:17,570
Yes, leave it there.

162
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,480
Three radishes, three Welsh onions, and one Wakegi onion, right?

163
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,810
Boss Kim didn't come in today.

164
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:29,710
Oh, that man went to get a vasectomy. He said that it'll be the death of him when he has a fourth child

165
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:32,350
because the couple's relationship is beyond good.

166
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:37,830
I'm asking because I'm thirsty. Can you get me a bottle of soft drink?

167
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:41,110
Yes.

168
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:04,560
♬  I'm saying I like you.  ♬

169
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:12,560
♬  I'm saying I love you.  ♬

170
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,750
I enjoyed the drink.

171
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:19,070
Thank you.

172
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:29,870
Get a hold of yourself. I guess you haven't gone through enough yet, you weird thing!

173
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:38,680
Wow, you were accepted into Taereung. Wow, Our Bok Joo is so amazing.

174
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,270
I guess your dream is finally coming true.

175
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:42,830
What did your father say? He's really happy, isn't he?

176
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:46,360
He is really happy. My dad's dream was actually to become a national team weightlifter.

177
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:49,490
He's probably thinking that it was worth it to support you by selling chicken.

178
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:54,090
You're being really good to your father right now. Where would your father find a daughter as good to him as you are?

179
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:57,260
I don't know. It still doesn't really feel real.

180
00:16:57,260 --> 00:17:02,940
I keep asking myself if I really became a national team member and if I'm really going to Taereung.

181
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,500
It doesn't feel real to us either that we'll have to be apart from each other.

182
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:11,640
We're one thing. But what are you going to do about Jeong Joon Hyeong?

183
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:15,240
It hasn't even been that long since you guys started going out, but you're already separating.

184
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:20,300
I know, right? It's something to congratulate you for, but it would probably kind of sucky for Jeong Joon Hyeong.

185
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:29,530
 The person you called is not available. Please leave a message after the beep. 

186
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:43,080
Why? You can't get in touch with Joon Hyeong?

187
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,640
Ah... no...

188
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,430
No. He usually doesn't turn his phone off.

189
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:54,410
That's what the swamp of dating is like. You get worried if you can't get in touch with the other person,

190
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:58,790
and if their voice changes even the slightest bit when they pick up, then you wonder if their feelings for you changed.

191
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:01,700
Ah, I don't think I'll be able to date. It makes me way too worried.

192
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:05,060
Do it while you can. This is a good time for us.

193
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:15,550
He's not answering. His phone is cut off.

194
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:18,050
We were wrong.

195
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:21,230
We should have told Joon Hyeong everything much earlier.

196
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:27,670
That little child accepting the presents we got while pretending not to know...

197
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:31,180
How hurt must he have been?

198
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:37,350
You did it because you were trying to be good to him. Don't torture yourself too much over it.

199
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:39,390
Joon Hyeong will be okay, right?

200
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:43,380
Of course, he will. Do you think he is a child?

201
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:53,980
Hello?

202
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:55,890
Sister-in-Law, it's me.

203
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:58,360
Yeah, yeah. Okay.

204
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:02,760
I was wondering if something had happened to Joon Hyeong.

205
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:07,730
He agreed to come here, but he's not coming. His phone is turned off, too.

206
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:15,020
My face is kind of swollen, isn't it? Then, it won't look good in the picture.

207
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:18,610
Hey, Bok Joo is keeping calm even though she's the one having an interview. Why are you making a fuss?

208
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:22,640
We're going to be in a group picture. I'm doing this for the revival of our Weightlifting department.

209
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,870
Look at this. Figure skating is Kim Yuna. Rhythmic gymnastics is Son Yeon Jae.

210
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:30,680
We need a representative for weightlifting too.

211
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:33,390
Then what about you? What is this?

212
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:37,460
- Bok Joo! Hey!
 - Oh, Comrade Tae Gwon!

213
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:42,000
- I was wondering if I should call you anyway. You were with Jeong Joon Hyeong last night, weren't you?

214
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:43,130
What?

215
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:44,740
What are you—

216
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,110
Jeong Joon Hyung didn't come back to the dorms yesterday?

217
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:52,710
I thought that he was out with you since his phone was cut off.

218
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:55,840
Where did that guy go? Something feels off.

219
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,110
When did you last talk on the phone with Joon Hyeong, Bok Joo?

220
00:19:58,110 --> 00:19:59,510
Yesterday afternoon.

221
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:02,400
Then has Jeong Joon Hyeong been missing since yesterday?

222
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,090
What in the world happened?

223
00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:16,730
Then after he left like that...

224
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:18,840
We can't make calls to him, either.

225
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:22,680
I thought he would have at least gone to school.

226
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:27,430
It must have been a huge shock.

227
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:32,350
The mother he met after ten years came here because of money, not because of him.

228
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:35,890
Ah, but why would he go to hide because of that? Such an immature guy.

229
00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:38,290
He's a really soft-hearted guy.

230
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:42,060
He's like that because he matured too quickly and it became a habit for him to pretend to be strong.

231
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:46,140
I know.

232
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,080
Mom couldn't even sleep a wink last night

233
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:53,970
because that was the first time she hit Joon Hyeong.

234
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:59,630
I'll continue to look for him, so if he calls you please call me immediately.

235
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:01,310
I'll ask you this favor.

236
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:20,650
Goodness, you're all working hard.

237
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:25,070
Hey, why are you so self-conscious about it? Didn't you hear the Professor's words?

238
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,700
There's nothing special just because the media is coming.

239
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:30,980
Do what you always do, what you always do—
 - They're here! They're here!

240
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:39,060
Ah, I washed my sweats but they didn't finish drying so...

241
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:42,500
You rascal!

242
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,420
You should go in.

243
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:45,600
- I mean, that suit...
 - Goodness.

244
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,800
- That's hilarious. 
 - What is he doing?

245
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,080
- What's wrong with him?
 - I don't know.

246
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,120
- How ridiculous.
 - Professor!

247
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,860
- Bok Joo!
 - Let's just do what we've always done.

248
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:56,140
Hey, are you not allowed to tell me what's going on?

249
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:58,620
By any chance, did Jeong Joon Hyeong's family go bankrupt?

250
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:02,930
Hey, hey, Jeong Joon Hyeong's family runs a pharmacy. There's no reason a pharmacy would go bankrupt.

251
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:06,440
I don't know what's going on but don't worry too much, Bok Joo. I'm sure nothing's wrong.

252
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:12,520
Yeah, he could just be drinking alcohol somewhere. Maybe overlooking the Han River on the bridge—

253
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:27,740
  The person you are trying to reach has their phone turned off. Please leave a message after the beep. 

254
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:35,080
Joon Hyeong, I heard. I know that you're having a really hard time right now,

255
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:41,500
but I'm so worried, so please call me just once. No, forget the call, just send me one message.

256
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:45,020
Okay? Okay, Jeong Joon Hyeong?

257
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:32,670
Woon Gi, straighten your back. More, more, that's good.

258
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:37,350
Hey, Nan Hee! One side is shaking! Like this!

259
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:40,620
Like this!

260
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:43,840
Ye Bin, Ye Bin, your shoulders might pop loose.

261
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:47,510
Your shoulders might pop lose.

262
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:48,950
Okay.

263
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:52,330
Hey, Ha Chaeng, stand straight!

264
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:58,230
- Ye Bin.
 - Mom, mom, I'm on TV!

265
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:02,070
Athlete Kim Bok Joo. First, congratulations on your advancement to the nationals.

266
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:09,560
I heard that after winning the competition, you had a slump. May I ask how you overcame that?

267
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:14,610
Oh... I just rested and thought about many things.

268
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:16,780
I also received help from the people around me.

269
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:20,200
More specifically, who helped you?

270
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:27,770
There's my family, the professor, the Coach, my best friends Lee Soon Ok and Jeong Nan Hee,

271
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:29,580
and...

272
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:31,870
  Kim Bok Joo. 

273
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:35,270
  Haneul Sports University's Weightlifting Department's Ace! 

274
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:41,340
  You won't make a mistake. You worked hard and your mental state is stronger than anyone's.

300
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:49,210
Did he get into an accident somewhere? Where is he?

301
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:51,800
Here.

302
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:55,390
Um...

303
00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:59,460
If you take these two out, how much is it? I didn't bring my wallet.

304
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:03,330
I'll pay for what he's short on, this included.

305
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:09,050
Bok Chicken, right? Let's call it even for the soft drink with this.

306
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:26,100
You drink so well. I guess you're a soju-lover.

307
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:33,050
Yes, beer is so bland. I guess you're a snack-lover. You're not even a kid but you're really cute.

308
00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:37,930
Well, I don't think I'm at an age to hear I'm cute.

309
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:44,810
But you're really cute. Your face is

310
00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:47,990
my style too.

311
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:53,330
Is Bok Chicken yours? Are you the boss?

312
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:56,150
Well, it's not mine, it's my older brother's.

313
00:28:56,150 --> 00:28:59,870
I'm an actor, although I've only taken supporting roles.

314
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:02,050
Goodness, really? Which shows have you been on?

315
00:29:02,050 --> 00:29:08,630
Well, that, r-recently, I played a crew member in the movie "Train to Bucheon" and

316
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:11,200
Sawing Man #3 on the "Insiders."

317
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:16,750
Ah... sawing? Now that I think about it, your face is familiar.

318
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:21,110
Oh, you were the sawing man! You were so frightening!

319
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:25,380
I mean, I'm not even included in the list of good actors but you even remember me.

320
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:29,850
I'm sorry but can't you show me your sawing scene? It just left such a huge impression on me.

321
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:35,880
Ah, how can I act here? Now, cut here and here.

322
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:44,660
Awesome! Awesome! It's exactly the same!

323
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:48,490
Of course, it's the same, I'm the same person. Now, one-shot.

324
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:50,950
You're a celebrity.

325
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:56,090
Let's go to my house and just drink one more shot, Sawing Man.

326
00:29:56,090 --> 00:30:00,530
Um, w-we can't do that yet. It's too soon to go to your house.

327
00:30:00,530 --> 00:30:05,270
I won't touch a hair on you and we'll just drink, okay? Okay?

328
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:09,440
Wait, my ear! Wait, my ear!

329
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:12,360
Let's go!

330
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,890
Oppa, charge!

331
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:22,450
Yes, Doctor. I still haven't heard from him.

332
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:25,960
I've been to every place he could have gone but he's not there.

333
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:30,090
Yes, I'll call you if I find him.

334
00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:31,880
Yes.

335
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:12,880
Hey, Jeong Joon Hyeong!

336
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:20,200
What are you doing here? Aren't you going to come out quickly?!

337
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:24,890
Hey, you jerk! Are you dead?!

338
00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:29,020
If you're dead, at least tell me you're dead, you bastard!

339
00:31:54,530 --> 00:31:58,320
I said, come out here quickly...

340
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:01,750
You're seriously dead when I get there.

341
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,920
Do you know how worried I was?

342
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:08,950
I even went the Han River because I thought you might have jumped in.

343
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:12,620
Why did you turn off your phone?

344
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:16,300
You bastard, you have to be hit to regain your senses, don't you?!

345
00:32:17,850 --> 00:32:21,100
What are you doing, Jeong Joon Hyeong?!

346
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:27,530
Jeong Joon Hyeong.

347
00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:35,670
Are you okay?

348
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,430
Bok Joo,

349
00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:45,870
they said that my mom didn't come to see me.

350
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:51,310
They said that she came because of money.

351
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:53,300
She came to borrow money.

352
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:58,540
I got ahead of myself.

353
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:07,200
Just as I endured even when I wanted to see my Mom to death,

354
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:13,300
I thought that she would have done the same.

355
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:18,310
I just got excited by myself.

356
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:22,300
I'm so embarrassed.

357
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:28,210
I'm em-embarrassed of myself

358
00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:31,490
and I'm embarrassed to my aunt and uncle.

359
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:36,950
I'm even sadder now than I was

360
00:33:38,010 --> 00:33:40,830
when she abandoned me back then, Bok Joo.

361
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:11,980
 Fatty: missed calls 18 

362
00:34:15,830 --> 00:34:18,220
 Connecting to the voice mail. 

363
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:22,290
  Hey, exactly where are you?! You're not even picking up your phone! 

364
00:34:22,290 --> 00:34:25,680
  Hey, I didn't know that you were such a selfish person who only thought about yourself, seriously. 

365
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:30,690
  Let's break up! If you're going to be like this, then let's break up! You jerk... 

366
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:37,140
This smells like old rags and it's too big. Don't you have something smaller?

367
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:39,530
Hey, that's the smallest one I have.

368
00:34:39,530 --> 00:34:42,950
Just think of it as hip-hop fashion and wear it.

369
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:53,040
Hey, your hair is still wet.

370
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:06,090
-There. You're so pretty, my baby.
 - Hey.

371
00:35:06,090 --> 00:35:10,020
Why am I your baby? Did you give birth to me?

372
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:14,800
Yeah, I'm your real mother, you immature rascal.

373
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:21,420
Do you know how worried I was?

374
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:23,740
You were really bad this time.

375
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:28,870
I know. I listened to your voicemails.

376
00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:34,330
Are you really going to break up with me? Are you now going to cut me off?

377
00:35:34,330 --> 00:35:36,070
That was a warning.

378
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:41,670
If you disappear without a trace again, I'm not going to show you any mercy.

379
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:45,350
You really like me a lot, don't you?

380
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:48,020
Even at a time like this! Even at a time like this, you can say something like that?

381
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:48,760
That hurts.

382
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:52,200
You need to be hit more. This is your aunt's This is your uncle's.

383
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:55,970
This is your mom's. This is the doctor's, and this is mine!

384
00:35:55,970 --> 00:35:59,730
Hey, your hands are really strong. It hurts.

385
00:35:59,730 --> 00:36:04,300
Let's leave quickly. I'm uneasy thinking that we could get caught by the night watchman at any time.

386
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:07,660
No, I can't leave.

387
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:10,780
What now?

388
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:12,510
I don't have shoes.

389
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:14,150
What?

390
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:15,990
I threw my shoes away.

391
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:26,140
Hey, you child! How could you throw away your perfectly good shoes?!

392
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:29,900
You walked around school barefoot?! You lunatic, seriously!

393
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:33,540
No, I was just so pissed off earlier.

394
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:38,100
This won't work. Going to the dorms like this is impossible.

395
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:41,350
No, it's fine. I can just walk there. I walked here before just fine.

396
00:36:41,350 --> 00:36:44,950
Forget it. You're doing all sorts of things in the middle of winter to get frostbite.

397
00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:48,300
Over there. There. Sit down on that bench over there.

398
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:51,300
Hey, where are you going?!

399
00:36:58,690 --> 00:37:05,030
Here. I went to the Weightlifting Department's locker room and stole my senior's shoes, so you have to give them back tomorrow.

400
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:06,790
Thank you.

401
00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:10,680
Aigoo. I'm even stealing shoes now, seriously.

402
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,710
You're cold, aren't you?

403
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:32,720
Yeah, right. You're quite considerate of me.

404
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:35,160
At least you have a mom to call "Mom."

405
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:37,690
There's even me, who doesn't even have a mom to call "Mom."

406
00:37:37,690 --> 00:37:40,720
Anyway, the ones with are always worse than the ones without.

407
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,270
I'm sorry.

408
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:47,380
Forget it. I don't think I'm the one you should be feeling more sorry to.

409
00:37:50,890 --> 00:37:53,810
You may feel upset hearing this

410
00:37:53,810 --> 00:37:57,120
but to be honest, I can kind of understand your mother.

411
00:37:57,850 --> 00:38:01,960
They say that each and every finger hurts if you bite them.

412
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:08,000
You're a finger in pain but she has a finger in more pain.

413
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,810
You should handle the finger in more pain first.

414
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:14,840
But that doesn't mean that you're not in pain.

415
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:22,450
Putting your mother aside, imagine how upset your aunt was.

416
00:38:22,450 --> 00:38:27,360
You should go quickly and assure her first. I heard that she couldn't sleep a wink last night.

417
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,330
How did you know that?

418
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:37,760
You met my older brother, didn't you?

419
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,440
What else could I do?

420
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:44,230
You left the dorms without permission and you weren't picking up your phone, so the only way I could hear about you was from the doctor.

421
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:47,400
I'm about to get irritated again, you rascal.

422
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:52,870
Go home quickly. Go and assure your aunt.

423
00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:55,700
Alright.

424
00:38:56,690 --> 00:39:00,320
- I'll go tomorrow. 
 - What do you mean, tomorrow?! Go right now.

425
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:03,000
You're embarrassed that you rebelled and even went to hide, aren't you?

426
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:07,280
It'll be even more embarrassing tomorrow. Go quickly.

427
00:39:09,330 --> 00:39:11,490
Let's leave after just one more minute.

428
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:21,720
I said I got it, so why did you follow me all the way here?

429
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:25,260
It's because I'm uneasy! I'm worried that you'll say you're going home but then run away again.

430
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:27,390
How embarrassing. My girlfriend just took me home.

431
00:39:27,390 --> 00:39:32,100
Stop joking around. If someone can take you home, anyone can take you home. Is there a rule that says only men can take women home?

432
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:33,470
Yes, Noona.

433
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:37,000
It's cold. Go inside quickly. Make sure to beg and say you're sorry.

434
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:41,300
Promise that you won't ever do it again, and take this to act charming. Understand?

435
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:47,790
I feel like she'll be really disappointed in me right now.

436
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:51,510
There's no disappointment between a mother and son. You two just have to hug tightly and it'll be over.

437
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:54,020
Go quickly! Go, go, go!

438
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:07,400
Thanks.

439
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:28,500
Ah, it's really cold.

440
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:32,130
Shouldn't there be an electric heater in the pharmacy, too?

441
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:37,870
- What about Dad?
- Dad went home first.

442
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:40,790
What is that?

443
00:40:40,790 --> 00:40:43,680
Oh, this? Roasted chestnuts.

444
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:47,090
They're selling these out front. You like these.

445
00:40:47,090 --> 00:40:50,560
Why did you buy them just before bedtime?

446
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,990
You're acting like that because you're worried your hands will get smeared with black dirt again, aren't you?

447
00:40:52,990 --> 00:40:56,520
Seriously, you've got a slight case of princess disease, Mom.

448
00:40:57,580 --> 00:41:02,530
It can't be helped. Your son will just have to peel them personally and feed them to you then.

449
00:41:13,910 --> 00:41:18,690
Ah, why? You have to eat this before it cools. Otherwise, it won't taste good.

450
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:23,740
Your hands are cold. I'll make you a glass of citrus tea.

451
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:41,040
Mom, I'm sorry.

452
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:45,840
I committed a sin worthy of death. I won't do it again.

453
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:51,930
That's why you should raise your children a little strictly.

454
00:41:51,930 --> 00:41:55,680
Because you doted on me so much when you raised me, I got all spoiled.

455
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:59,970
What did you say? You bad rascal. I'm really speechless.

456
00:41:59,970 --> 00:42:04,330
Mom. I'm really sorry.

457
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:15,060
You probably don't realize how thankful I am

458
00:42:15,810 --> 00:42:18,070
and how much I love

459
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:21,850
you, Dad, and Hyung.

460
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:26,250
Our family is really

461
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:31,280
 much  more precious to me

462
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:34,170
than you think, Mom.

463
00:42:40,970 --> 00:42:42,370
It's Mom's smell.

464
00:42:42,370 --> 00:42:46,920
Aigoo, I was so tied up in knots because of you that I didn't even wash my hair.

465
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:49,060
Aigoo, it's no wonder!

466
00:42:51,070 --> 00:42:54,800
- Does it smell really bad?
 - Yeah, it really does.

467
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,510
- Come here.
 - Huh?

468
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:57,910
Aiyoo!

469
00:42:58,490 --> 00:43:02,250
Aigoo, you grew up well.

470
00:43:17,730 --> 00:43:19,390
Mom!

471
00:43:22,750 --> 00:43:24,630
Joon Hyeong!

472
00:43:26,710 --> 00:43:29,410
There was more traffic than I thought there would be.

473
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:34,060
I was worried that I'd leave without being able to see you.

474
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:37,690
Thank you so much for coming.

475
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:42,900
- Um, Joon Hyeong—
- Thank you for giving birth to me, Mom.

476
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:47,150
I came because I wanted to say that.

477
00:43:49,430 --> 00:43:51,040
Also...

478
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:54,200
This.

479
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:01,700
I'm going to give this back to you since it's yours.

480
00:44:04,750 --> 00:44:07,540
I think that I'll be okay without it now.

481
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:23,830
Do you, by any chance, have a picture of my younger sister? I want to see her.

482
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:38,140
Her name is Amelia.

483
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:41,370
She's pretty because she looks like you.

484
00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:47,560
She's going to get better soon. Please bring her the next time you come.

485
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:54,340
She's going to love you because you're handsome.

486
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:02,420
You saw her at school before, didn't you?

487
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:06,150
She's my girlfriend.

488
00:45:06,150 --> 00:45:10,340
Oh, so she was?

489
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:14,070
She's really pretty.

490
00:45:21,010 --> 00:45:24,540
- Did you send your mom off well?
 - Yeah.

491
00:45:25,340 --> 00:45:29,980
You did well. You're pretty. You listened well.

492
00:45:30,570 --> 00:45:33,150
Of course. Whose am I?

493
00:45:43,110 --> 00:45:45,180
 Go Joo Hwan Internal Medicine 

494
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:54,870
You're still the same. So clumsy.

495
00:45:54,870 --> 00:45:58,880
Won't your desk collapse like this?

496
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:01,360
Why are you here? When did you come?

497
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:06,670
If I say that I stopped by to see you on the way to some other business nearby

498
00:46:06,670 --> 00:46:08,990
you won't believe me, will you?

499
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:13,500
I came to see you. I closed the clinic early, too.

500
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:17,020
What the heck? Why are you doing things that you never used to do?

501
00:46:17,020 --> 00:46:21,400
I asked the nurse outside, and she told me that you only see patients in the mornings on Saturdays.

502
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:23,870
I'm your last patient, then.

503
00:46:23,870 --> 00:46:26,910
Let's go out and eat. I'm hungry.

504
00:46:26,910 --> 00:46:30,050
You came all the way here just to eat?

505
00:46:30,050 --> 00:46:35,250
Yeah. I realized that I don't have any friends to eat with since you're not there.

506
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:37,790
Let's go eat.

507
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:48,120
- He's so handsome!
 - He's really handsome.

508
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:50,040
- Awesome.
- He's so handsome.

509
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:52,990
- That girl behind him must be his girlfriend.
- I don't know, I don't know.

510
00:46:52,990 --> 00:46:54,910
Oh, I'm so jealous.

511
00:46:54,910 --> 00:46:57,070
 I've never seen a man that handsome in my life! 

512
00:46:58,610 --> 00:47:01,110
Hey, hey! What are you doing?

513
00:47:01,110 --> 00:47:04,250
Hey, cover up most of your face like this from now on. Okay?

514
00:47:04,250 --> 00:47:07,600
Hey, I don't have the kind of looks that can be covered up just because I cover them.

515
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:14,720
Jeez, being handsome is really a handicap. Hey, have you ever thought about cutting off all your hair?

516
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:17,370
Well, I'll do it if you tell me to.

517
00:47:19,190 --> 00:47:24,520
How can I separate from you with nervousness that you'll get swept away by some other woman?

518
00:47:27,030 --> 00:47:32,950
Joon Hyeong, actually, I couldn't tell you beforehand because I was afraid you'd be disturbed.

519
00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:36,810
I've become a national team athlete, Joon Hyeong. I'll go to Taereung next week.

520
00:47:36,810 --> 00:47:39,100
Hey, don't lie.

521
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:42,530
I have a World Weightlifting Championship in China in February.

522
00:47:44,190 --> 00:47:47,220
What the heck? Are you serious?

523
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:50,920
Seriously? Hey, seriously?

524
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:55,430
Aweso— Hey, hey! Congratulations, seriously! How could you become a national athlete from lifting those heavy barbells?

525
00:47:55,430 --> 00:47:58,870
I'm more amazed at you, who won't sink in water.

526
00:48:00,350 --> 00:48:02,190
Aren't you upset?

527
00:48:02,190 --> 00:48:06,650
It hasn't even been that long since we started going out, but we have to separate. It'll be hard for me to get any nights out, either.

528
00:48:06,650 --> 00:48:10,000
Hey, it's okay! I just have to follow you right there.

529
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,760
- What?
 - I have a swim meet next week.

530
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:18,310
It's a competition that gets you selected to become a national athlete, so I'll go straight to Taereung if I make first place.

531
00:48:18,310 --> 00:48:21,320
- We have a worldwide athletic competition soon, too.
 - Really?

532
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:23,650
- Do you really become a national team member if you make first place?
 - Yeah.

533
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:27,060
If you make second place, they judge you based on your previous competitions.

534
00:48:27,060 --> 00:48:30,920
But if you make first place, you become a national team member right away.

535
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:33,730
Ah, I was planning on just taking it easy and doing it half heartedly this time,

536
00:48:33,730 --> 00:48:36,840
but I'm suddenly starting to really want to win.

537
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:39,670
- Are you really confident?
 - Of course, I am!

538
00:48:39,670 --> 00:48:42,200
If I don't have a problem with my start, then I can take it all.

539
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:44,880
Oh, Joon Hyeong! I want to go to Taereung with you!

540
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:48,670
- Let's go together, okay?!
 - Hey, don't worry. I'm going to go to that competition and win everything.

541
00:48:48,670 --> 00:48:50,620
So I'll follow you right there, you got it?

542
00:48:50,620 --> 00:48:53,580
I want to go together. Really!

546
00:49:02,370 --> 00:49:06,240
Hey, but that doesn't mean we should do additional practice right away.

547
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:08,930
Hey, you disappeared and missed practices for two days!

548
00:49:08,930 --> 00:49:12,450
Does it make sense for a guy who has to make first place to do that? Let's hurry up and go practice, quickly!

549
00:49:12,450 --> 00:49:14,700
Ah, let's go eat some food first.

550
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:17,280
Food, my foot! Hurry up and run.

551
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:19,050
I'll run if you give me a kiss, then.

Hey!

556
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:39,210
Hey, make a streamline! Your head! Head!

557
00:49:39,210 --> 00:49:42,870
One, two! Your speed is good! Go, go, go!

558
00:49:42,870 --> 00:49:45,940
One, two! Touch!

559
00:49:46,870 --> 00:49:50,920
Oh, Jeong Joon Hyeong, your condition got much better. Good job.

560
00:50:15,370 --> 00:50:18,190
Hey, but did you really pack this yourself?

561
00:50:19,740 --> 00:50:21,250
This is really delicious.

562
00:50:21,250 --> 00:50:24,680
I'm so proud. You're eating well.

563
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:27,580
Hey, hurry up and run if you're done eating. Hurry, hurry! Quickly!

564
00:50:27,580 --> 00:50:32,590
Hey, why would I run right after I ate? My stomach will hurt if I run right after eating. I can't run. I can't run, seriously!

565
00:50:32,590 --> 00:50:35,350
- Hurry up and run!
- Oh, cut my stomach! I can't. Cut my stomach!

566
00:50:35,350 --> 00:50:39,870
Hurry up and go! Hurry up, it won't hurt. Go, quickly!

567
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:43,310
- I'll run if you give me a kiss.
 - Ah, really, you are getting into a habit.

568
00:50:43,310 --> 00:50:45,280
I'll give you one if you run.

569
00:50:46,590 --> 00:50:48,270
I'll give you a kiss if you run.

 Swim Championship Meet for the National Team 
♬   we're starting to search for the wonderful days   ♬ 

582
00:51:39,390 --> 00:51:44,910
♬   From now on when it gets hard,   ♬

583
00:51:44,910 --> 00:51:52,740
♬   who cares if we give up? We can just go forward two steps tomorrow   ♬

584
00:51:52,750 --> 00:51:59,360
  We now have the men's 200-meter finals. The swimmers are coming in.  

585
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:15,480
  On the fifth lane, we have swimmer Choi Tae Hoon. He has been privately training in Australia  

586
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:18,760
  and returned to Korea three days ago for this competition.  

587
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:21,820
  Will we be able to see an outcome of his training?  

588
00:52:21,820 --> 00:52:24,790
 The swimmer who was disqualified with a false start at the Presidential Championship Meet last time. 

589
00:52:24,790 --> 00:52:26,560
 - Swimmer Jeong Joon Hyeong?
 - Yes. 

590
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:30,230
 If he just does well on his start, then I think we can expect a good outcome. 

591
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:33,420
 He always got disqualified because of his starts, right? 

592
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:39,420
 Will he possibly be able to overcome that trauma at this final competition? It's very interesting. 

593
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:40,820
Take your mark.

594
00:52:48,190 --> 00:52:51,570
 Yes, Swimmer Choi Tae Hoon in Lane 5 had the fastest start. 

595
00:52:51,570 --> 00:52:55,700
  Swimmer Jeong Joon Hyeong also jumped in properly. 

596
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:05,120
  Oh, Swimmer Jeong Joon Hyeong is pushing through. He is catching up now. 

597
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:08,160
 Right. Swimmer Jeong Joon Hyeong is swimming with the tremendous speed on the last lap. 

598
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:12,290
  He's only a handspan long away from Swimmer Choi Tae Hoon. He's practically caught up to him now. 

599
00:53:12,290 --> 00:53:15,070
 Right now, he caught up to him. 

600
00:53:15,070 --> 00:53:18,800
  Yes, now... I feel like both swimmers finished at almost the same time!  

601
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:22,980
  That's right. They came at about the same time.  

602
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:27,600
  Ah, so 
 Choi Tae Hoon: 1:51:30  1st
Jeong Joon Hyeong: 1:51:33  2nd 

603
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:32,830
  Swimmer Choi Tae Hoon took first place, and Swimmer Jeong Joon Hyeong took second place by a narrow margin. 

604
00:53:32,830 --> 00:53:36,530
 Swimmer Jeong Joon Hyeong was really amazing. 

605
00:53:39,790 --> 00:53:42,540
Yes, this is Kim Chang Geol.

606
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:47,120
What? A kidney donor?

607
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:50,370
Ah, yes. Today's not a good day for me,

608
00:53:50,370 --> 00:53:53,180
but it will be possible for me to be admitted tomorrow.

609
00:53:53,180 --> 00:53:56,950
Ah, yes, yes. I understand. Then we'll agree for me to be admitted tomorrow.

610
00:53:56,950 --> 00:53:58,990
Yes, yes. Yes.

611
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:04,300
Why, why, why? Did they say that you should get surgery? Did they say they found a kidney donor?

612
00:54:04,300 --> 00:54:08,090
Yes, well, even though I'm second on the kidney recipient waiting list,

613
00:54:08,090 --> 00:54:13,210
it might be a match. They want me to be admitted immediately today to get some additional tests done.

614
00:54:13,270 --> 00:54:16,540
Then why are you going tomorrow? You need to go when they tell you to come.

615
00:54:16,540 --> 00:54:20,350
Hey, you rascal! Even if I go, I have to go after I send Bok Joo off to Taereung.

616
00:54:20,350 --> 00:54:23,580
If I become hospitalized or what not, imagine how conflicted she would be.

617
00:54:23,580 --> 00:54:25,500
Still, this is something you shouldn't hide.

618
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:28,710
Even if I decide to receive surgery, we'll set a date

619
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:31,540
and tell her then, depending on the situation.

620
00:54:31,540 --> 00:54:34,470
I don't think this is something you should keep quiet about.

621
00:54:34,470 --> 00:54:38,250
Won't Bok Joo resent me later?

622
00:55:03,990 --> 00:55:07,880
Good job. My Joon Hyeong, you were the best!

623
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:12,420
If my arms were just a little longer, I could have won this competition.

624
00:55:12,420 --> 00:55:16,290
I really wanted to win first place and go to Taereung with you.

625
00:55:16,290 --> 00:55:20,000
It's fine. You can't do better than this.

626
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:25,060
You overcame your start trauma perfectly, and from now on, you'll win first place every time.

627
00:55:25,060 --> 00:55:29,010
All that's left is for you to rise.

628
00:55:34,390 --> 00:55:37,180
Ugh, there are thirteen hours,

629
00:55:37,180 --> 00:55:42,540
26 minutes, 15 seconds, 14 seconds, until you get into there.

630
00:55:42,540 --> 00:55:46,820
Bok Joo, will I be able to endure without seeing you?

631
00:55:48,750 --> 00:55:51,520
I'm more worried about myself.

632
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:54,840
You made me become addicted to you without even realizing it myself.

633
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:58,880
Well, I have a quite fatal charm.

634
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:04,820
Still, you can't escape or anything because of me so I'll follow you immediately.

635
00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:09,420
If you go there and put your weightlifting shoes on backward  (cheat on me) , both you and I will die, understand?

636
00:56:09,420 --> 00:56:15,100
Talk about yourself. I've already stationed Soon Ok and Nan Hee as your paparazzi.

637
00:56:15,100 --> 00:56:19,310
Ah, those Uglies. I'm ruined!

638
00:56:20,740 --> 00:56:24,360
What time do you leave tomorrow? I'll escort you to Taereung.

639
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:27,010
No, I want to go in alone.

640
00:56:27,010 --> 00:56:31,340
You said that you'd follow me immediately! To do that, you need to train whenever possible. You don't have time to take me there.

641
00:56:31,340 --> 00:56:34,980
Wow, you're already so ambitious for me to become a National team member.

642
00:56:34,980 --> 00:56:36,690
I'm going to go to Taereung, no matter what.

643
00:56:36,690 --> 00:56:39,770
Please do so.

644
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:43,770
Whenever you have time, go check out our store.

645
00:56:43,770 --> 00:56:47,070
My Uncle is there but I'm still worried about my Dad.

646
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:50,290
Alright, just trust me.

647
00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:58,550
Ugh! Now it's 13 hours, 22 minutes, 12 seconds, 11 seconds—

648
00:56:58,550 --> 00:57:00,780
Yeah, Nan Hee.

649
00:57:00,780 --> 00:57:04,120
Your weightlifting uniform? Why are you asking me to get it for you?

650
00:57:05,070 --> 00:57:08,680
Just... Fine, you wench! I'll stop by the weightlifting practice room.

651
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:10,770
Bye, yeah.

652
00:57:10,770 --> 00:57:13,610
- What? Did the Uglies ask you to bring something?
 - Yeah,

653
00:57:13,610 --> 00:57:15,620
I think we'll have to stop by the weightlifting practice room.

654
00:57:15,620 --> 00:57:17,880
Alright, let's go.

655
00:57:23,660 --> 00:57:27,770
Wait. Why it so dark? Why are even the emergency lights turned off?

656
00:57:27,810 --> 00:57:30,240
Hey, this is a chance.

657
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:32,350
What chance?

658
00:57:32,350 --> 00:57:34,950
Hey, we can't! What if someone comes in?

659
00:57:34,950 --> 00:57:38,100
Who'll come in here? There's no one here.

660
00:57:38,730 --> 00:57:41,100
- Surprise!
 - Surprise!

661
00:57:48,830 --> 00:57:52,670
Bok Joo, receive a drink.

662
00:57:56,030 --> 00:58:00,770
I told the Taereung coach that you're a special disciple of mine so he should take special care of you.

663
00:58:00,770 --> 00:58:04,430
You, be especially careful of your back. You know that you have to take care of your own body now, right?

664
00:58:04,430 --> 00:58:07,010
Yes, Coach. Yes, Professor.

665
00:58:07,010 --> 00:58:11,930
Thank you. If you two weren't here, I would never have been able to come this far.

666
00:58:11,930 --> 00:58:14,490
Come on. Why is the atmosphere like this? It's not as if we're never going to see each other again.

667
00:58:14,490 --> 00:58:17,520
It's true that we won't be able to meet for a while.

668
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:21,540
When we go for runs, when we eat, when we do snatches and clean-and-jerks, and even when we train!

669
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:23,560
Who will I partner with now, Bok Joo?

670
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:27,340
You have Soon Ok. You're just putting on a show to try to get me to stay.

671
00:58:27,340 --> 00:58:32,000
But you, you've been standing there frozen since before. What's your name?

672
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,890
I'm Jeong Joon Hyeong who entered into the Swimming Department in 2015.

673
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:39,450
- His voice is a work of art.
 - He's really handsome.

674
00:58:39,450 --> 00:58:41,100
Bok Joo, you must be happy.

675
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:43,910
Bok Joo really caught a good boyfriend.

676
00:58:43,910 --> 00:58:47,510
He looks exactly like me when I was 20. I used to look like that.

677
00:58:47,510 --> 00:58:49,050
Professor, I don't think that's right.

678
00:58:49,050 --> 00:58:50,920
Um, your lie is too severe.

679
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:54,120
I'm not lying, you rascal! I was so handsome that my nickname was—

680
00:58:54,120 --> 00:58:57,760
Now! Our Bok Joo, train well in Taereung,

681
00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:00,680
and I hope that you'll raise the stature of Korean weightlifting at the competition in China.

682
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:02,490
Kids, cheers!

683
00:59:02,490 --> 00:59:05,340
Cheers!
 ♬   I don't know where this feeling   ♬

684
00:59:05,340 --> 00:59:07,560
Thank you!
 ♬   came from   ♬

685
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:09,610
- Here.
 - This is delicious.

686
00:59:09,610 --> 00:59:10,970
 Can we eat now? 
♬   There's a small quake   ♬ 

687
00:59:10,970 --> 00:59:13,330
 Yeah, eat, eat up.

691
00:59:29,850 --> 00:59:32,070
This is the bellflower elixir.

692
00:59:32,070 --> 00:59:35,140
It's good for immunity, so have it when you have a cold,

693
00:59:35,140 --> 00:59:38,130
and this has some ginseng.

694
00:59:38,130 --> 00:59:41,000
Make sure to take one every single day, alright?

695
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,530
Do well.

696
00:59:44,070 --> 00:59:46,490
Dad.

697
00:59:47,890 --> 00:59:50,540
Bok Joo, should I take you there on my scooter?

698
00:59:50,540 --> 00:59:53,920
No, I'll just take the bus and go by myself. I want to do that.

699
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:55,570
Alright then.

700
00:59:55,570 --> 00:59:59,230
Uncle, please take good care of my dad.

701
00:59:59,230 --> 01:00:01,440
I'll only trust you.

702
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:06,260
Hey, I'll take care of everything so don't worry about him and just focus on taking care of your own body.

703
01:00:06,260 --> 01:00:10,460
Don't skip your meals and train diligently.

704
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:16,070
Kim Bok Joo of the Weightlifting Department of Hanuel Sports University has received the order to depart to Taereung today.

705
01:00:16,070 --> 01:00:18,880
Yes, I'll salute my father and my uncle. Salute!

706
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:20,390
Salute!

707
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:23,040
- Take care.
 - Yeah.

708
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:25,780
I'll leave now. Dad, don't send me off. Bye!

709
01:00:29,530 --> 01:00:33,880
Hyung, since we've sent Bok Joo off, let's go to the hospital now.

710
01:00:44,110 --> 01:00:47,800
  Joon Hyeong, I'm leaving. 

711
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:50,090
  To be honest, I couldn't show you 

712
01:00:50,090 --> 01:00:54,160
  but I'm really nervous and scared right now. 

713
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:56,960
  Will I be able to do well? 

714
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:59,290
  After I open that unknown door and enter, 

715
01:00:59,290 --> 01:01:02,470
  what kind of world will be waiting for me? 

716
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:08,710
  Don't worry, Bok Joo. You'll do well. 

717
01:01:08,710 --> 01:01:12,460
  You're much stronger and prettier than you think you are. 

718
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:15,400
  You'll shine brilliantly wherever you are. 

719
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:18,020
  Kim Bok Joo, swag! 

720
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:25,190


721
01:01:25,190 --> 01:01:27,520
  I'll wait for you, Joon Hyeong. 

722
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:31,400
  Don't take too long coming here. I'm quite impatient. 

723
01:01:32,180 --> 01:01:35,340
  Wait, I'll follow you soon. 

724
01:01:35,340 --> 01:01:38,200
  You know that this Oppa has no reverse, right? 

725
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:43,720
  I miss you, Jeong Joon Hyeong. 

726
01:01:44,420 --> 01:01:46,600
  I miss you, Bok Joo.
