1
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:34,570


2
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:37,110
- Yes, Mom. 
-  Hey Jae Yi, are you coming home late  today? 

3
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:40,370
- No, I won't be late. 
  - Then remember the dumplings from before?  

4
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:42,360
- Oh yes, you mean the dim sum? 
  - Oh yes, that one.  

5
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,690
- Okay, I'll buy it.
 -  Alright then. 

6
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:46,630
Yes.

7
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,210
Are you bored?

8
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,150
Do you want gum?

9
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:02,020
This is sugar-free, so no need to worry.

10
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:16,400
I don't think there's water in the car.

11
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:21,150
Ah, that's okay, that's okay. I can just hold my breath.

12
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:38,070
How slipshod I am, really!

13
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:46,210
Ah, the atmosphere was good too.

14
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:49,730
You waited a long time, right? I couldn't find a convenience store.

15
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:52,810
I did pull a warm drink from the vending machine.

16
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:56,620
Here.

17
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:59,600
Thank you, Doctor.

18
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:05,240
How is it? Are you all right?

19
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:08,900
Yes, I think so.

20
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:14,620
It's cold in the morning and evenings.

21
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:19,000
Your clothes are too thin.

22
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:25,290
It hasn't stopped yet. Try drinking some more.

23
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:34,650
Drink. It's okay to drink a lot.

24
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:36,420
Please drink more.

25
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,520
  Episode 6 - If the Tail is Long, it Will Get Stepped on or Captured. 

26
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:55,680
 I first started swimming when I was eleven. 

27
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:01,730
To the lonely, unfamiliar and uneasy me, water

28
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:05,340
was like a haven.

29
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:09,760
Almost like... in my mother's arms.

30
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:21,310
Actually, when I was ten my mom sent me to my uncle's house,

31
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:24,270
because my mom remarried and left for Canada.

32
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:26,810
Then what about your current parents?

33
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:30,880
They are my aunt and uncle. Jae Yi is my cousin.

34
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:33,640
But still it was okay,

35
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:37,450
because my mom would send a lot of presents  and postcards every Christmas,

36
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:40,240
I didn't think I was being abandoned.

37
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:43,110
because we were going to meet again someday.

38
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,500
But then ...

39
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,930
 Mom, do you have a water-proof bandaid? 

40
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:50,800
 Did you get hurt? 

41
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:54,470
 Over there at the entrance to the room. Look in the drawer. 

42
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:26,470
When I looked at the postcards again,

43
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:31,570
the penmanship on the cards delivered to me all the while was different from the first three.

44
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:37,520
It was almost as if someone were trying to imitate my mom's writing.

45
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:40,710
So, it was your aunt.

46
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:43,840
Then, was that day...

47
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:48,410
Yes. That was the first competition when the symptoms appeared.

48
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:55,150
Thank you, for telling me things that were hard for you to say.

49
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:59,660
Do you think it is connected to what I am going through?

50
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:04,420
I believe so. As I told you before,

51
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:07,880
panic disorder, conversion disorder, or trauma.

52
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,850
Hearing impairment and deafness could happen.

53
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:19,500
I think that day, the shock was quite big for you.

54
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,550
The connection you felt with your mother

55
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:26,470
disappeared all of a sudden.

56
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:29,990
Good!

57
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:33,230
Since we've found the reason

58
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:36,810
we can figure things out, step by step.

59
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:40,870
The fact that you were able to convey your thoughts to me may have healed you by 50% already.

60
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:44,690
Then, let's see...

61
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:48,510
What would be the best approach for you?

62
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:51,620
I think we might have to test things a bit.

63
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:55,190
When is your next competition?

64
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:48,200
Thank you for the ride. Bye.

65
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,620
Ah what is that? What's wrong with her?

66
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:56,110
If she's going to see him, she should dress better to appeal to him!

67
00:06:56,110 --> 00:07:00,400
That way, my hyung would say, "Oh, Bok Joo, you look lovely today."

68
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,990
But if she goes looking like that... Aish!

69
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:09,160
I can drop you off in front of your place. It's not polite to  make a girl walk alone at night like this.

70
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:12,810
No, it's really okay. I can make it home from here with my eyes closed.

71
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:15,590
And, I have to stop by the market and pick up a few things.

72
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:17,730
Okay. See you at the clinic.

73
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:22,080
Oh, and don't forget to stretch before you sleep.

74
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,800
Yes. Good bye, Doctor.

75
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:31,060
Oh my, oh my. You're going to break your back Bok Joo!

76
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:35,050
Aish, what am I going to do with you Bok Joo?

77
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:38,100
You like him? You like him?

78
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:44,890
Where are you going? Where is she going? You don't ride the subway.

79
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:59,860
 Toilet 

80
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:15,250
Three, two, one!

81
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:19,250
Okay! She came out.

82
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:36,420
Oh, am I catching a cold? That dumb dress!

83
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:38,800
Hey. Who is this?

84
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,530
Our school's weightlifting fairy, Kim Bok Joo!

85
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:46,160
Are you keeping tabs on me 24 hours a day? How can we meet all the time?

86
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,000
I know, it amazes me too. Why do I always see you?

87
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,030
What's that?

88
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:55,690
It's nothing, so mind your own business.

89
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:59,250
By the looks of it, you went to a musical.

90
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:03,790
You didn't get all dressed up in a dress and heels, did you?

91
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:05,990
Are you crazy? Why would I get all dressed up?

92
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:08,430
I was just asking if you did.

93
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:13,120
My brother really hates the extra feminine type.

94
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,790
Really?

95
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:16,800
No. It's a lie.

96
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,740
What kind of a man doesn't like a girl who gets all dressed up?

97
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:24,630
Hey, you're making fun of me because you already saw me, aren't you! You, evil man!

98
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:28,750
Oh, I spent all that money and got cursed.  I'm feeling really wronged here.

99
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,590
Then, who told you to make fun of me?

100
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:33,900
I spent all my allowance for the month on those tickets!

101
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:36,220
Buying the tickets? Well, thanks for that.

102
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:39,540
Of course, you should be grateful.

103
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:43,910
So, was it fun with Hyung?

104
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:46,870
It wasn't bad, and I got to ride in his car.

105
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:51,630
Ooh!!! A drive! You did everything!

106
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:56,360
Bok Joo, there is danger!

107
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:05,380
 ♬ What? ♬ 

108
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:10,720
 ♬ What?♬  

109
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:17,440
Wow, that could've been bad!

110
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,880
Hey, something bad could've happened if I didn't have good reflexes!

111
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,560
Why is he driving like that?!

112
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,490
Hey! Come here, bastard!

113
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:27,660
Jeong Joon Hyeong!

114
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:49,640
Why? Are you going to go? You should lie down a little longer.

115
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:52,080
No, I'm okay now.

116
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:55,910
It seems like a temporary stomach cramp, so I'm giving you some painkillers.

117
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:57,820
This is an antacid.

118
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:01,270
Make sure to take this after meals.

119
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:03,790
Thank you.

120
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:09,830
Stomach cramps are usually caused by hyperacidity induced by  stress. Are you under a lot of stress these days?

121
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:11,310
Yes, a little bit.

122
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:14,190
By any chance, because of a man?

123
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:16,550
Wait, who in the world is he?

124
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:20,540
That stupid guy who makes such a pretty girl end up in this state?

125
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:30,810
You should dry your hair first. It's soaked through right here.

126
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:34,260
Are you giving a disease and offering a remedy? You'd better shut up.

127
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:40,690
Give it here, give it. How could you dry anything like that?

128
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:42,070
Forget it!

129
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:45,500
Stay still, I'll dry it for you.

130
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:56,570
Aigoo, I'm so sorry. What should I do about this?

131
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:10,930
Forget it. You do it yourself! I don't care whether you do it or not.

132
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:14,090
Who asked you to do it in the first place, you crazy punk?!

133
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:26,630
Hey, do you think Hyung can tell that you like him?

134
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:31,930
No. He probably can't even imagine it in his dreams. I don't want to get found out.

135
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:34,570
Men don't really like women who do weightlifting.

136
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:40,770
See, look! My hands are full of calluses. Who would like hands like this?

137
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:45,740
What's wrong with that? They're like medals because you exercise. Plus you feel safe when you walk at night.

138
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:48,020
I'd really like that.

139
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:50,300
You speak so well.

140
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:57,910
But it was still a good day. I got to have something like a date thanks to you.

141
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:02,540
I took a drive with him earlier, and it felt like I was Cinderella riding her pumpkin carriage.

142
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:07,560
It was like going straight back to reality when the clock strikes twelve.

143
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:11,150
But she at least becomes the prince's wife later on.

144
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:17,040
I know, right? I don't  even see any movies that don't have happy endings because I feel kind of down.

145
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:29,310
Have you heard that there's a toad in that fountain over there that grants wishes?

146
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:31,220
- What?
 - You don't know?

147
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:34,310
Heol. Are you really a student at Haneul? It's a very famous legend.

148
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:40,240
You know our school sunbae athletes that won gold medals? They all say it was thanks to that toad.

149
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,330
You really need to work on your creativity.

150
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:48,080
No, it's true! I'm saying this because you don't know.

151
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:51,490
It's said that if you just pray desperately, it'll grant your wishes without any questions or arguments.

152
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:55,880
Just try asking it once for things to go well with Hyung.

153
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:58,250
As soon as you open your mouth, lies just—

154
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:05,220
Hey, did you catch a cold?

155
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:07,520
I have been feeling pretty painful pressure on my sinuses since earlier.

156
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:11,950
I'm sorry, but I have some important plans later on, so I can't catch a cold.  I'll leave first.

157
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:16,920
♬   Living in a dream all day  ♬

158
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:19,430
Why are you being like this?

159
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:24,590
♬   Will you come to me,  you and I in my dream?  ♬

160
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:30,130
I told you I can't catch a cold, seriously!

161
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:34,640
It's going to last forever! My germs are super strong and my colds get really bad.

162
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,020
Virus, swag!

163
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:38,730
Hey, you better watch out if I catch your cold.

164
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:44,580
I'll seriously... I'll give it right back to you by kissing you! You just wait.

165
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:49,390
Should I go with you together? Why are you leaving already?

166
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:53,450
Hey, Swimmer Jeong! Let's go together!

167
00:14:54,520 --> 00:15:00,340
♬  I was still wandering and searching for a dream  ♬

168
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:09,750
I guess I really did catch a cold. Ah, how annoying.

169
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:19,610
Are you sick? Your face is totally white.

170
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:21,130
I'm all right.

171
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:25,630
I have a cold too. Does this room have bad luck or something today?

172
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,570
Why can't I open it?

173
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:29,220
Give it here. I'll do it for you.

174
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,620
- It's okay. I'll do it.
 - Hey, just give it here.

175
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:33,730
Forget it, I said I'll do it!

176
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:39,730
I'm sorry. I was a bit oversensitive.

177
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:49,890
 If Bok Joo raises her weight class, she definitely could win. 

178
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:54,560
Hyung, they are asking something more?

179
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:59,950
What are you doing right now? The chicken is all burnt!

180
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:04,450
Aigoo, aigoo. It's all burnt, all burnt! What should I do about this?

181
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:08,120
What were you doing, burning the chicken? Were you falling asleep or something?

182
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:13,560
No. I was thinkingm briefly  of something else.

183
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:17,480
I'm going to focus on his upper body for now, so I'm planning to keep the amount of weight he lifts the same and increase his reps.

184
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:20,760
Yes. He will also have to increase the frequency of his training with the pro team, right?

185
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:25,430
Let Woong Gi do that on his own. He'll be able to regulate that much.

186
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:29,310
What a relief that Woong Gi made up his mind!

187
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:32,820
But either way, it'll be kind of hard on Bok Joo, won't it?

188
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:38,170
It will be hard to talk to her about it without Sunbae's consent. It'll be hard for Bok Joo, too.

189
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:41,580
Oh, you have come.

190
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:46,520
Sunbae, why did you come all the way here? You should have called. I would have gone to you.

191
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:52,160
You clearly know why I'm here. I'm busy, so let's just get to the point.

192
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,330
Yes, Sunbaenim. Please speak.

193
00:16:55,330 --> 00:17:01,880
About what you said before... Bok Joo's increase of weight.

194
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:07,160
I wonder what's going on?

195
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,450
How would I know?

196
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:13,250
Ah, I feel so uneasy.

197
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:17,000
I'm curious. I'm so curious. It's driving me crazy!

198
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,530
Stay still! I can't focus on anything, so just stay still.

199
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:23,640
Bok Joo, hurry up and come out!

200
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:27,960
Huh? My weight class?

201
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:31,330
That's right. You're surprised, right?

202
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,120
Of course, you are. Even I'm shocked.

203
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:38,660
Professor and I think that it's more than possible for you.

204
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:43,320
Of course, it's not the norm to raise your weight class a few months before a match.

205
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:48,110
But you have strength, and you've had an unofficial record title in the 63-kilo weight class.

206
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:50,160
That was when I was in my best condition, though.

207
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,050
So you should increase it quickly. We'll help you and take responsibility for you.

208
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:59,130
You're well aware of this, but the competition in the 58-kilo group is incredibly intense right now.

209
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:04,080
It doesn't matter how skilled you are. If your condition isn't good on the day of the match, then the color of your medal will change in your weight class.

210
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,630
But there is no representative weightlifter for the 63-kilo group, either domestically or internationally,

211
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:11,750
since Weightlifter Jang Geum Ran retired.

212
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:17,030
We're not telling you this to make you feel burdened, but if you do move up to the 63-kilo group,

213
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:20,790
then Bit Na or other weightlifters can also dream of getting a medal in the 58-kilo match.

214
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:27,250
That's right. This is a win-win, Bok Joo. It's advantageous to you, and it also gives the other kids an opportunity.

215
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:30,260
It's more than possible if you just raise your weight about 3 or 4 kg.

216
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:33,750
Woon Gi is also getting a program together for it, since we spoke with him about it.

217
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:38,400
If you just make up your mind, then we can really attempt this.

218
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:41,330
But I want to talk to Father first.

219
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:44,260
He's already heard about this, you brat. He gave us his permission.

220
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:47,390
What?! Father did?

221
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:50,530
Why did you give them permission without even talking to me, seriously?!

222
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:54,480
Hey, brat. Do you think it was an easy decision for me?

223
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,830
I couldn't get a wink of sleep all night because I was thinking about it all night.

224
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:59,830
But still, why did you decide such an important thing all yourself?!

225
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:03,100
Do you think that it's easy to raise my weight class like inflating a balloon?

226
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:08,280
You know that it's harder to gain weight than to lose because you have to make muscles!

227
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:12,220
I know, kid. I know, but life itself is a challenge.

228
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:15,810
 And a weightlifter's mindset is to always challenge themselves and achieve their goals. 

229
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:18,840
As your coaches said, there are more chances to get a medal.

230
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,160
 It's a good strategy. 

231
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,230
Father!

232
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:25,020
I have to fry the chicken! A delivery order came in, so I'm hanging up. We'll talk later.

233
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:29,460
Father! Ah, he seriously just does whatever he wants to! Even to the end, he hangs up as he pleases!

234
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,430
Calm down, Weightlifter Kim.

235
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:35,370
It is hard, but it's not totally impossible, right?

236
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:38,780
That's right. Gaining weight isn't that hard for you.

237
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:42,860
That's not it... I'm seriously going crazy!

238
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:47,590
What's making you go so crazy that you stamp your feet? We'll help you.

239
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:49,990
That's right. We'll eat with you in the name of friendship.

240
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:53,090
That's not it!

241
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:56,120
Why does it have to be now? Ah, seriously!

242
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,990
Don't run! You'll lose weight!

243
00:19:57,990 --> 00:19:59,980
Hey, Weightlifter Kim! Let's go together!

244
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:00,920
Dad does whatever he wants.

245
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:04,250
Seriously! Ah!

246
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:10,030
What? Do you want to compete at the Central Bank Cup Meet?

247
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:15,170
Why? The competition is small, so it's not really that helpful to you.

248
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:17,790
Please just view it as practice.

249
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:22,290
Well, in fact, you have to try it out  frequently in the actual meets so  you can get over your problem with starts.

250
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:24,150
It's a praiseworthy thought for the first time in a while.

251
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:29,440
Hey, if you do,  you'd better get a medal with the same guts that rejected the offer of being Choi Tae Won's training partner.

252
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:33,720
No. If Roberto kicks a goal at the early morning soccer clubs' game, everybody will speak ill of him.

253
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,410
Look at this punk, playing around!

254
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:36,820
Alright then. Go ahead and try it.

255
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:39,180
Yes, sir. I understand.

256
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:51,590
Kim Bok Joo, I caught your cold in the end. I caught it.

257
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:56,030
Why does it have to be now, of all times?

258
00:20:57,450 --> 00:20:59,350
Hey, Fatty!

259
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:10,370
Hey, how are you going to take responsibility for this?

260
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:14,800
I really caught a cold because of you! I've got a match next week, so how are you going to take responsibility for this?!

261
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:18,190
Shut up. I'm already in a super bad mood.

262
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:20,280
Is there something wrong with you?

263
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:23,030
I don't know. Everything's all twisted up.

264
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:26,000
You looked all happy just yesterday. What's wrong now?

265
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,990
My coach told me to raise my weight class.

266
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:29,630
Your weight class?

267
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:33,680
Oho, Kim Bok Joo! Are you finally moving up to the heavy class?

268
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:36,100
But, what's the problem?

269
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:38,660
Hey! Right now,

270
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:41,050
my situation is up in the air. And there's the thing about the clinic too.

271
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:43,480
Hey, that's not a problem!

272
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:47,370
You're going there to see Hyung, not because your goal is to lose weight.

273
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:50,670
If you're not going to quit weightlifting, then you should get yourself together and do what needs to be done.

274
00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:53,350
That's true, but...

275
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:57,030
Hey! You speak really easily when it doesn't involve you!

276
00:21:57,030 --> 00:21:59,810
Do you think the world is all that simple?

277
00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:02,980
Of course, what would a kid like you know about life?

278
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:07,600
Your parents are well off, you're naturally talented, you're good-looking, and you've even got women lined up behind you.

279
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:13,220
I'm the idiot for trying to talk to you as if we're on equal ground. Buzz off, you well-off punk!

280
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:15,250
Wow.

281
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:20,620
Who are you getting mad at right now? Look at her, yelling at me after she gave me a cold!

282
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:23,030
 Weightlifting Department 

283
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:27,800
"You should do what you have to do. Do what needs to be done." That jerk, he talks so easily when it's not about him.

284
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:30,470
Oh, I'm so pissed off, seriously.

285
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:34,090
Hey, Bok Joo!

286
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:35,930
What? What is it?

287
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:38,500
What, what?

288
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:41,830
Ah... I left my training log over there.

289
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:46,300
Oh, and here I thought...

290
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:50,370
So, what about it? Did you think about it?

291
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:52,040
Pardon?

292
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,100
Yes, well...

293
00:22:56,100 --> 00:23:02,460
To raise your weight, you'll have to get into the special program right away. Everything is already planned well.

294
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:13,200
But, then I...

295
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,330
Um, well, I'll... Yes, I'll try it.

296
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:17,710
You really want to?

297
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:20,010
You want to try it out, huh?

298
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:23,880
Professor! Professor!

299
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:26,450
Bok Joo said she'd try it. She made up her mind.

300
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:30,310
Oh really, Bok Joo? You really want to try it?

301
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:33,630
You thought well.

302
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:36,980
We told you last time, right? This is completely possible for you.

303
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:40,350
That's right! If our Bok Joo can't do it, then who could?

304
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:42,690
Hey, your dad will be so happy!

305
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:46,210
Then let's start carrying out the project today!

306
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:50,540
I'll take charge of Woon Gi. And Coach Choi, you take charge of Bok Joo.

307
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:54,410
Yea! It seems like the top structure is being established.

308
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:55,990
Alright, Coach. Are you confident?

309
00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:58,890
Of course! I have a venomous side as well.

310
00:23:58,890 --> 00:24:00,390
That's scary.

311
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:03,930
Bok Joo, you'll have to make sure you don't get bit by Coach.

312
00:24:03,930 --> 00:24:05,840
Hey!

313
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:16,860
♬   Will you be spinning in delight?  ♬

314
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:21,760
♬   I think you're so pretty.  ♬

315
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:26,800
♬   However we shouldn't do it... Both   ♬

316
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,450
Oh!

317
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:32,600
Another tray. 
♬   confession and repentence  ♬

318
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:37,840
♬   in red hot passion are clumsy, but  ♬

319
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:43,200
♬   we each have big and little concerns worrying us.   ♬

320
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,090
Another tray.

321
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:49,430
Coach, I can't eat any more of this. There's a lot of food on the tray too.

322
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:51,940
You won't gain more than a few pounds just with that amount.

323
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:53,420
You should have another tray.

324
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:58,090
♬   In our personal heaven we are starting to search for a wonderful day.  ♬

325
00:24:58,090 --> 00:25:03,730
♬   From now on when it's hard if we give  up by turning around  ♬

326
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:10,700
♬   we will reconsider. Tomorrow we will run two steps forward.  ♬

327
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:18,890
Ah, it was going so well. Why did it suddenly increase?

328
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:22,390
No.

329
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:25,370
No, I guess I didn't control my diet well.

330
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:26,650
It's right.

331
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:28,660
I was the one that didn't do well.

332
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:30,930
It's okay. Your weight can fluctuate in the beginning.

333
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:33,760
Instead, we'll do two procedures together.

334
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,420
Lie down.

335
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:42,660
That's weird. You definitely went up one kilo yesterday.

336
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:45,200
Why did it go back down by 0.5 kg?

337
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:49,470
Hey, Kim Bok Joo. Did you possibly

338
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:53,620
go to the bathroom a lot today?

339
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:56,070
Yes, a little.

340
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:58,700
Hey, this won't do. Let's fill you up again.

341
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:02,960
Let's go have snacks and bosam!

342
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:11,130
Do harder. Woon Gi has already gained by 0.6 kg.

343
00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:14,360
No, not yet. I have far to go yet to reach the planned amount.

344
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:16,500
Bok Joo is going to make it soon, too.

345
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:20,610
Hey, Bok Joo. You eat this meaty part right here.

346
00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:33,500
Wow, your cold is dragging on way too long.

347
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:39,460
Of course, you pretty much live in the water all day because of the competition, so is there any way you wouldn't catch a cold? Aigoo, and you aren't taking any medicine.

348
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:41,640
But Hyung, why are you going to that competition?

349
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,790
Isn't that for kids who just started to gain some experience?

350
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:48,470
Hey, you losers! Those who don't have the good times always question the level of the meet.

351
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:50,760
Learn something, learn, you punks!

352
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:54,190
When you're freshman or sophomore—

353
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:57,200
You just eat up too, you bastard.

354
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,900
Hey, you're all done eating, right? We'll get up first.

355
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:10,030
I didn't eat it all. I'm not finished.

356
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:13,390
- You clueless bastard.
 - I'm not finished yet!

357
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,150
You have a competition?

358
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:20,500
It seems like you caught a cold, so what are you going to do? You cough for a long time when you catch a cold.

359
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,820
You're a threat.

360
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:25,400
You've reached stalker level now. Is it fun for you?

361
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,300
Is there any way it would be fun?

362
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:30,070
It's exhausting, hurts my pride, and is so embarrassing I want to die.

363
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:34,890
But I want to grasp a fragment of a straw right now.

364
00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:38,530
I have only you as my straw.

365
00:27:38,530 --> 00:27:42,390
You're mistaken. I'm not a straw.

366
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:44,560
I'm just me.

367
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:49,410
I got it. I'll leave. Finish eating before you go.

368
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:54,490
You probably won't even be able to take medicine for your cold, so you should at least eat.

369
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:11,830
It seemed like you were rejected by Jeong Joon Hyeong in there.

370
00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:16,990
Doesn't it look bad? You still have a title of our school queen.

371
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:19,990
That's why you kept rejecting me?

372
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:25,410
It's not too late for you to come to me. I'm confident I can treat you better than that punk Jung Joon Hyung.

373
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:31,670
Get lost, bastard.

374
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:39,960
I don't want to, I don't want to! I'm not eating all this today!

375
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:42,090
I don't want to, don't want to! I don't want it!

376
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:43,990
Why can't you eat it?

377
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:47,990
All you have to do is to get a few pieces of chicken legs and swallow them down with the broth, then it's all over!

378
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:53,040
I intentionally got all this together and even put ginseng and abalone in it and boiled it for several hours for you to eat it!

379
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,510
I ate three trays of food at the school cafeteria!

380
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:59,690
My stomach has limits too! How am I supposed to just swallow down food all the time?!

381
00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:00,720
Ah, seriously.

382
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,660
Pick it up! Just stay still!

383
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:07,200
Bok Joo, I know it's not easy, but just close your eyes and live like you're dying for right now.

384
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:11,030
From what I can see, you definitely can win. I'm telling you, I've got a hunch about this!

385
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:13,790
What do you know just because you got a hunch, Dad?!

386
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:15,570
I'm the one who isn't confident. It's me!

387
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:18,140
Ah, just eat it! Ah, my arms are going to fall off!

388
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:20,870
We are under negotiation. Keep holding this!

389
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:24,710
- You're so loud, you damn guy!
- How am I supposed to hold this?

390
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:26,930
- Ah, you're here, Sunbaenim?
- Oh, Coach Choi!

391
00:29:26,930 --> 00:29:29,650
Why did you prepare all of this? It must've been hard.

392
00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:31,590
I'm also planning on feeding Bok Joo some pizza.

393
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:33,630
Oh, really? Then, let's head inside.

394
00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:37,620
- Should I carry it for you?
- No, it's fine. Carrying things is my job, you know.

395
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:39,570
Hey Bok Joo, let's eat.

396
00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:41,630
You didn't have to..

397
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:46,070
How the heck am I supposed to eat all that?!

398
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:56,450
Definitely, Athlete Kim, your dad is an amazing cook!

399
00:29:56,450 --> 00:29:59,460
He is totally a "flav-wiz"! Flavor wizard!

400
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:03,060
That's right. But hey, you even get total support like this.

401
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:06,150
Seeing how you can eat as much as you want, it's not that bad. Right?

402
00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:11,350
That's right. It's way better than having to eat like a bird like the rhythmic gymnasts.

403
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:14,840
Eat a lot. Why are you just picking at your food?

404
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:19,940
Yeah, here, have some pizza. Want me to pick out a drumstick for you? You like drumsticks.

405
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:22,340
You said you wished a chicken had four legs.

406
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:24,740
It's because I'm so sick of eating chicken.

407
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:27,270
I think if I cried, chicken broth would come out as tears!

408
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:29,480
You're right, I am quite full.

409
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,390
At this rate, all three of us might need to raise the weight class together?

410
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:33,770
Why are you saying such weak words?

411
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:37,760
Our forever helping friend, Noona Soda is there.

412
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:41,740
Please help us, Noona Soda!

413
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:44,540
I have some coins so I'll grab some.

414
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:46,920
Ah, seriously.

415
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,230
Don't worry about it. You'll lose weight. Let me do it.

416
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:55,210
I'll do it.

417
00:30:56,920 --> 00:31:00,490
"Miss Kim Bok Joo, your appointment has been set for 4:30 tomorrow. The J Obesity Clinic."

418
00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:03,640
They said you have an appointment tomorrow at the J Obesi—

419
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:06,250
♬  What?!  ♬

420
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:09,170
Hey, why are you going to an obesity clinic?

421
00:31:09,170 --> 00:31:11,400
No. It's not that. Come here.

422
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:14,980
Hey!

423
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:20,350
Why would you go to the obesity clinic when you have to gain weight?

424
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:23,020
What have you been doing lately?

425
00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:25,930
Nan Hee...

426
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:27,970
I can hold this.

427
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:35,960
- You've worked hard today. 
 - You too Doctor.

428
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:40,420
So, it's that man? Not Jeong Joon Hyeong?

429
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:47,930
So, that person is that jerk Jeong Joon Hyeong's older brother.

430
00:31:49,970 --> 00:31:54,050
So, you... As an excuse to see him

431
00:31:54,050 --> 00:31:56,660
you spent all that money to enroll in the program.

432
00:31:56,660 --> 00:32:02,350
And you've been going around lying to us. And in order to keep Jeong Joon Hyeong quiet, you lifted those rice sacks.

433
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:05,560
That's what you're saying right now, right?

434
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:08,030
- Yes. 
 - You crazy girl!

435
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:10,400
I know I deserve getting cursed. You're right that I am totally crazy.

436
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:14,170
A person in her right mind wouldn't do this. And so I tried hard not to, but...

437
00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:19,840
I kept thinking about him, and I kept getting confused, so I had no choice.

438
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:24,440
And... I just wanted to see his face.

439
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,300
I acknowledge it.

440
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:29,490
He's so much better than Jeong Joon Hyeong.

441
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:32,280
He's a total man. With muscles, and strong.

442
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:33,730
Right? My doctor is cool, right?

443
00:32:33,730 --> 00:32:40,000
Yeah, totally cool. He is handsome as well.  And he's even a doctor!

444
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,230
You little rascal, pretending not to have any interest in men.

445
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:48,290
You totally have a good eye for men!

446
00:32:48,290 --> 00:32:51,510
But, exactly, how did you first meet?

447
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:55,260
Don't tell me it was like Kang Dong Won in the movies... when he holds the umbrella for you in the rain

448
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:59,220
It's not like that, is it?

449
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:04,930
♬   I'm dreaming   ♬

450
00:33:04,930 --> 00:33:12,100
♬   I'm dreaming of everlasting happiness   ♬

451
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:16,540
- It was like that! 
 - Seriously? He held the umbrella like this.

452
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:19,170
Ah, really?! Oh my god, that's so heart-pounding!

453
00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:22,580
- He's totally good looking, right? 
 - Nan Hee wants that too!!

454
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:26,050
What do we do? Now you have someone.

455
00:33:31,650 --> 00:33:34,330
 For Song Si Ho 
This ginger and date tea is good for getting rid of colds, make sure you drink it - Mom 

456
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:40,070
Hey, hey! What are you doing? Go rest!

457
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:44,320
You have a competition tomorrow and you are still sick! You have to take care of yourself.

458
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,600
Just after I watch this.

459
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:49,920
Hey, watching this won't make something happen for you. Just rest.

460
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:53,520
Ah, okay! I got it.  You're not even my mom, but are nagging like it!

461
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:57,880
Hey, stop being difficult and get some sleep.

462
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:08,450
 It's me Song Si Ho. Can you not tell Joon Hyeong and meet me outside for a little bit? 

463
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:18,800
Sorry, you were probably surprised because I called you out so suddenly.

464
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,740
Here.

465
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:23,670
What is this?

466
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:27,640
It's a ginger and date tea. I heard Joon Hyeong has a competition tomorrow.

467
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:30,170
If I gave it to him, I didn't think he would drink it.

468
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:39,360
What is it?

469
00:34:40,450 --> 00:34:43,780
It's hot love.

470
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:47,820
What is it? Ginger tea?

471
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:52,100
Don't ask, don't question. Just drink it all up.

472
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:54,310
Just think of it as medicine.

473
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,700
It's good.

474
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:05,340
I'm finally starting to feel better.

475
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:06,870
That's good.

476
00:35:06,870 --> 00:35:12,050
That's why, you jerk, I told you to stay warm!

477
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:18,530
So, what I'm saying is that since your body and heart are cold you are more susceptible to viruses and, what is this... oh...

478
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:24,090
I have to go to the bathroom. It's really urgent. I'll be right back. Drink all that up.

479
00:35:24,090 --> 00:35:26,090
What is he talking about?

480
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:31,870
And do you know how sexy his voice is?

481
00:35:31,870 --> 00:35:36,630
It's not too high or too low. It's like honey!

482
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:43,100
It makes me think this sound should be like the prince's voice that Snow White heard when she woke up.

483
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:48,620
Are you serious? I only saw him but didn't get to hear his voice!

484
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:52,380
When he laughs, he gets a slight wrinkle near his eyes

485
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:56,390
and it shows up the whiteness of his teeth. It's really marvelous.

486
00:35:56,390 --> 00:35:59,830
The heart throbs and melts

487
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:05,230
And the thing that totally made me fall for him. And this is very important.

488
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:09,600
It's none other than his... thoughtfulness.

489
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,370
I've never met someone with such great manners!

490
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:17,330
You know, where it's not contrived, but it's just his character.

491
00:36:17,330 --> 00:36:22,450
When I'm with him, I feel like I've become the most beautiful woman.

492
00:36:22,450 --> 00:36:28,460
I don't know because I've never been treated that way before.

493
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:31,660
Regardless, it's a total fantasy.

494
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:35,350
He's kind, gentle, strong,

495
00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:39,690
to the point where I can't believe that Jeong Joon Hyeong is his younger brother. He's a total man!

496
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:43,740
Hey, listening to you makes feel I'm meeting him personally.

497
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:45,720
What do you mean meeting him?

498
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:51,380
No way, you're not going to fight me for him, are you? I have to be more careful.

499
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:53,150
You're the kind that always just acts on your instincts.

500
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:57,330
No matter how much I want him, do you think I would ever take your man?

501
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,280
My man? Ahhhh!

502
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:06,290
What are you guys doing here?

503
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:07,770
What do you mean? We came to pee.

504
00:37:07,770 --> 00:37:11,170
- We were going out. Let's go. 
 - Did you guys, by chance,

505
00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:17,700
speak ill of me? You're not supposed to do that! You two just left by yourselves earlier.

506
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:21,690
No way! What is there to say bad about you?

507
00:37:21,690 --> 00:37:26,110
Of course! Don't say such nonsense! Let's go, let's go.

508
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:32,510
Hey, do you think everything will get done in one go?

509
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:36,570
If you want to gain weight, you have to eat a lot.

510
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:40,530
Thank you, Soon Ok.

511
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:46,700
Oh, Soon Ok, can you get me some water?

512
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:50,100
I think the food is stuck because I ate this meat too quickly.

513
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,410
Hey, here's some water.

514
00:38:04,050 --> 00:38:06,640
You should eat more slowly.

515
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:09,160
Oh, it finally went down.

516
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:12,870
Oh, Athlete Kim, you look good today.

517
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:15,100
Here, have some more.

518
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:30,280
Are you going now? It's 6:00.

519
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:34,790
But you are going like this? Really?

520
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:36,620
Why? Does it look weird?

521
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:38,490
Yes, it looks weird.

522
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:42,900
You said 6:00, right? Just five minutes.

523
00:39:01,930 --> 00:39:06,060
Okay. I tried my best.

524
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:07,610
Thank you, Teacher.

525
00:39:07,610 --> 00:39:09,200
Let's go!

526
00:39:42,730 --> 00:39:45,010
Are you really going to go?

527
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:47,360
Yes.

528
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:49,210
Okay. Let me take a look.

529
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:52,960
Since you're going this time, do well, you brat!

530
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:56,190
I got it, okay? Go back in.

531
00:39:58,830 --> 00:40:03,630
If a friend is going to a competition, I should go watch. Ugh, why do I have to go train?

532
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:07,920
So go and do your best. You swim worse than me.

533
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:11,150
Ah, this little well-entitled punk. I got it, okay?

534
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:16,610
I'm going to stick my neck out there and do my best! So go you little bastard. I dare you to not win first.

535
00:40:16,610 --> 00:40:19,270
You got touchy, you cute bastard.

536
00:40:19,270 --> 00:40:20,950
I'm going.

537
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:26,740
Do your best for real!

538
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:29,210
Focus on the start!

539
00:40:30,090 --> 00:40:33,670
It's roasted abalone this time? You fed me abalone chicken ginger soup last time!

540
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:36,790
 Those were just regular abalones from the market. 

541
00:40:36,790 --> 00:40:39,630
These are abalones fresh from the sea this time! I called someone

542
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:43,140
whom I haven't' talked to in ten years to get this for you, you brat!

543
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:46,330
 So I'm saying just make some time later and come here. 

544
00:40:46,330 --> 00:40:50,900
And don't bring your friends with you! Even for you, it's not enough.

545
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:53,150
 Only 30 abalones were brought. 

546
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:56,150
Ah, okay. I'm hanging up.

547
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:06,480
Where are you going? By any chance, to the clinic?

548
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:09,220
Why do you ask when you know exactly where I'm going?

549
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:12,630
I'm going to a competition. Why don't you give me some positive energy?

550
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:16,100
Wouldn't someone who's already well-off do good?

551
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:19,590
I do not wish for your success. Make mistakes!

552
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:26,870
That the ill-tempered! Seriously. I've already been so nervous even if you didn't say so, but you speak unkindly.

553
00:41:26,870 --> 00:41:28,670
You're dead.

554
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:36,340
Hey! Joon Hyeong, seriously! Such a crazy bastard, seriously.

555
00:41:41,730 --> 00:41:44,730
Ah, you gained weight again.

556
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:52,560
Bok Joo, why can't you meet my eyes?

557
00:41:53,490 --> 00:41:56,980
I'm sorry, Doctor, for disappointing you.

558
00:41:56,980 --> 00:42:01,370
Ah, you don't need to be sorry towards me. After all, this is all for you.

559
00:42:01,370 --> 00:42:06,510
It's hard to control your eating, huh? And I bet the people around you are no help as well.

560
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:07,910
Yes.

561
00:42:07,910 --> 00:42:12,950
You have to be careful of snacks after dinner. But our human culture life happens  at night in our country.

562
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:16,350
Indeed, a lot of the clinic patients say they want to be treated at on a desert island.

563
00:42:16,350 --> 00:42:20,070
I know, right? It's not like I can stop seeing my friends, though.

564
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:25,280
You can work hard and bring down your weight, so let's start a procedure after you change.

565
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,750
Yes.

566
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:30,450
Ah, Joon Hyeong has a competition today.

567
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:33,620
I sent him a message to not be nervous and to do well.

568
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:35,770
but he hasn't sent me a message. Probably because he has no time to do.

569
00:42:35,790 --> 00:42:38,330
I'm sure he'll do well. He has a lot of self confidence.

570
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:41,720
He just looks like that on the outside. He's actually very fragile.

571
00:42:41,730 --> 00:42:44,910
He really had to shed blood and make his mind up to go to this match.

572
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:49,870
 He was disqualified for a false start at an international swimming competition two years ago. 

573
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:53,020
 His training time is better than making the national team cut.  

574
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:56,950
  But after that incident, he kept making start mistakes at important competitions. 

575
00:42:56,950 --> 00:43:00,440
 I think that first shock became a traumatic experience for him. 

576
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:06,300
What is this? He pretends he's strong all alone.

577
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:12,050
Ah, I gave him my cold and talked badly to him without even knowing about it.

578
00:43:12,050 --> 00:43:15,090
Aigoo, your mouth! Stupid mouth.

579
00:43:24,370 --> 00:43:29,630
If Jeong Joon Hyeong  does bad, I feel guilty, so please let him do well.

580
00:43:29,630 --> 00:43:35,490
And, what was it, a trauma? I hope that he can quickly get better and get a stronger constitution.

581
00:43:35,490 --> 00:43:37,540
Please!

582
00:44:00,850 --> 00:44:08,470
 When those symptoms come to you, the best thing to do is to not focus on those symptoms. 

583
00:44:08,470 --> 00:44:13,100
 When you start becoming nervous, turn your thoughts to something else. 

584
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:19,110
 Focusing on your breathing, or doing things like counting backwards would more than likely be effective. 

585
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:27,340
 Ten, nine, eight... 

586
00:44:27,340 --> 00:44:32,900
 Seven, six, five... 

587
00:44:35,850 --> 00:44:37,670
 Four... 

588
00:44:38,290 --> 00:44:43,240
 Three, two... 
  The 11th Central Bank Cup Swim Meet will start soon... 

589
00:44:51,770 --> 00:44:53,300
 One. 

590
00:44:59,180 --> 00:45:06,140


591
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:09,850
Please, Joon Hyeong, please.

592
00:45:34,870 --> 00:45:36,430
 Ready. 

593
00:45:42,230 --> 00:45:45,800
Five, four, three...

594
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:47,480
One.

595
00:46:22,590 --> 00:46:25,240
  In the first place, Donga University's Lee Sang Geun. 

596
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:28,070
 In second place,  Cheongju City's Choi Jae Hyeok. 

597
00:46:28,070 --> 00:46:31,140
 In 3rd place, Kyeongjin  Athletics Association's Park Jun Soo. 

598
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:34,670
  In fourth place, Haneul Sports University's Jeon Joong Hyeong. 

599
00:47:08,290 --> 00:47:12,630
No, it's not here. He is not in the ranks.

600
00:47:12,630 --> 00:47:16,410
This idiot! He should have done better! Doesn't that mean he got disqualified?

601
00:47:16,410 --> 00:47:18,480
This little punk.

602
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:25,260
 Jeong Joon Hyeong, are you all right? Cheer up!  

603
00:47:30,170 --> 00:47:33,830
 Jeong Joon Hyeong, serves you right! 

604
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:40,330
What should I write him? All these lines are so cringe-worthy.

605
00:47:56,710 --> 00:48:01,030
Drink it all without leaving anything.

606
00:48:08,540 --> 00:48:10,110
Drink it all.

607
00:48:11,990 --> 00:48:17,560
Ah, if it hadn't been for this cold, I would have been first. Even if I am so luckless, I didn't think I'd be this unlucky.

608
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:20,570
That's why we're telling you. You should have come here before the competition.

609
00:48:20,570 --> 00:48:25,310
Mom had studied the pharmacology and made this medication specially to give you.

610
00:48:25,310 --> 00:48:29,340
I know, right. I think I'm being punished for thinking too lightly about this competition.

611
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:35,440
That's okay, my son. You said it was a small competition right? Shake it off and forget about it.

612
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:36,850
Did you talk with your brother?

613
00:48:36,850 --> 00:48:41,030
Yes, of course. I'm going to go crazy from his nagging.

614
00:48:41,030 --> 00:48:45,170
He's not even your mini-me, but he's gotten all of your worries.

615
00:48:47,550 --> 00:48:48,900
  Where are you? 

616
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:51,000
- It's Fatty.
 - Fatty?

617
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,740
Who is Fatty?

618
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:57,220
Someone. A very fun friend.

619
00:48:57,220 --> 00:48:58,890
It sounds like a dog's name.

620
00:48:58,890 --> 00:49:00,760
He said Fatty?

621
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:03,900
 What's going on for you to message me? 

622
00:49:11,910 --> 00:49:14,570
 I'm asking where you are. 

623
00:49:14,570 --> 00:49:18,190
 Home. I'm about to go back to school. 

624
00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:22,510
He's going to get here soon.

625
00:49:28,380 --> 00:49:32,590
What the heck, Kim Bok Joo? Why are you telling me to meet in front of the fountain?

626
00:49:39,410 --> 00:49:41,910
What's up, Kim Bok Joo? What's that?

627
00:49:41,910 --> 00:49:43,380
Here a toad.

628
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:54,320
It's not because you talked about a toad or anything,

629
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:58,210
but two or three color papers were lying around and I was bored.

630
00:49:59,100 --> 00:50:02,780
Who knows? That could become a good luck talisman.

631
00:50:03,670 --> 00:50:06,630
Ah, you really aren't good with your hands.

632
00:50:06,630 --> 00:50:09,080
Look at how crinkled up this is.

633
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:10,940
Exactly how many times did you refold it?

634
00:50:10,940 --> 00:50:12,420
Hey! Give it back!

635
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:15,670
Hey, how could you take something back after you gave it away?

636
00:50:15,670 --> 00:50:18,890
I'll take it for now! I don't know if it'll give me good luck though.

637
00:50:18,890 --> 00:50:20,720
Toad swag.

638
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:22,590
- Why are you plagiarizing?
 - What?

639
00:50:22,590 --> 00:50:27,170
You uglies go around saying this all the time. Swag.

640
00:50:27,170 --> 00:50:30,290
Ahh, it seems different because I'm the one saying it, doesn't it?

641
00:50:30,290 --> 00:50:34,000
It seems like it's become refined and cool.

642
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:38,150
What are you saying? Looking at how you're talking crap, you must have recovered from your cold a little. Are you okay?

643
00:50:38,150 --> 00:50:42,920
Yeah. I'll get better. I took some medicine at home before I came too.

644
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:50,490
I'm sorry for talking badly to you earlier. I'm a little sensitive these days.

645
00:50:52,620 --> 00:50:56,260
Hey, but you should take this chance to do well!

646
00:50:56,260 --> 00:51:00,280
I know, right? Well, I trusted in my skills and just got too big-headed.

647
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:04,350
Hey, don't worry. In a short while, I'm going to cause a huge accident.

648
00:51:04,350 --> 00:51:07,440
You just don't ask me for a hundred autographs or something later on.

649
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:10,980
I'm going to be in the Olympics around that time, though!

650
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:13,490
Possibly.

651
00:51:14,710 --> 00:51:19,540
Let's go. There's a little time left until night attendance. I'll order you something to help you recuperate.

652
00:51:19,540 --> 00:51:22,350
Really? What are you going to buy me?

653
00:51:22,350 --> 00:51:27,980
There's something that makes you majorly strong. Just follow me with your mouth.

654
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:32,630
But why are you heading toward the school?

655
00:51:41,810 --> 00:51:43,340
Ah, seriously, just wait a second.

656
00:51:43,340 --> 00:51:45,500
- Hey, you want to ride it?
- Yeah! What is this?

657
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:49,960
Hey, no way, no no! The last time I gave you a ride, I was in bed for three days because my back hurt!

658
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:51,260
No, you can't, you can't.

659
00:51:51,260 --> 00:51:52,980
Do you want to die, seriously?!

660
00:51:52,980 --> 00:51:55,600
Aish! No, you can't!

661
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:58,730
Ah, I'm not going, I'm not going.

662
00:51:58,730 --> 00:52:01,830
Ah, let's just hurry up and ride this and go!

663
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:05,970
I'm ordering food for you, but you're saying that I shouldn't ride your bike.

664
00:52:05,970 --> 00:52:08,350
Jung Joon Hyeong, hurry up and ride it. Hurry. Hey!

665
00:52:08,350 --> 00:52:11,040
- Hey, Jeong Joon Hyeong!
 -The customer is not answering the phone. If you would like to leave a message... 

666
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:13,650
Let me see whether you don't ride this in the end.

667
00:52:13,650 --> 00:52:15,940
You said that you would ride it!

668
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:19,850
Hey! Should I throw this away?

669
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:23,870
Ah, seriously!

670
00:52:32,550 --> 00:52:33,680
Who's this friend?

671
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:35,300
Introduce yourself. This is my dad.

672
00:52:35,300 --> 00:52:36,830
Hello.

673
00:52:36,830 --> 00:52:38,970
- This is—
- Ah!

674
00:52:38,970 --> 00:52:41,590
- That credit bill! 
- Yes that's right.

675
00:52:41,590 --> 00:52:43,910
- You know him, Dad?
-Ah, from that time.

676
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:47,260
I came here once with friends, not knowing this place was yours.

677
00:52:47,260 --> 00:52:49,550
What's the relationship between you two?

678
00:52:49,550 --> 00:52:53,800
This is the first time Bok Joo has brought a male student home with her. This is quite interesting.

679
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:57,640
He's a childhood classmate and a swimmer at my school.

680
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:05,240
I brought him because I owe him something and am about to pay it back. You have a lot of abalones, right, Dad?

681
00:53:06,260 --> 00:53:08,650
- Huh?
- Abalones.

682
00:53:08,650 --> 00:53:10,090
What abalone?

683
00:53:10,090 --> 00:53:12,580
The wild abalone.

684
00:53:15,730 --> 00:53:18,760
You said that you got some wild abalone from Wando.

685
00:53:19,510 --> 00:53:22,340
You've got a lot, right?

686
00:53:25,790 --> 00:53:29,380
I didn't know you were classmates with Bok Joo.

687
00:53:29,380 --> 00:53:31,780
Eat a lot.

688
00:53:31,820 --> 00:53:34,920
This is  really  precious.

689
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:40,370
Hey, eat this.

690
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:45,470
No, you eat. I'm not really that hungry.

691
00:53:45,470 --> 00:53:49,420
Hurry up and eat! I'm the type that can't stand having an unpaid debt.

692
00:53:49,420 --> 00:53:53,120
You have to eat it quickly for your cold to get better.

693
00:53:56,590 --> 00:53:58,980
- Father! 
- What?

694
00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:03,460
Oh, oh, oh! Eat comfortably. Comfortably.

695
00:54:12,230 --> 00:54:15,570
Is it delicious?

696
00:54:24,540 --> 00:54:27,550
Ah, seriously.

697
00:54:28,650 --> 00:54:30,320
- Eat up!
 - It's really fascinating

698
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:33,410
to see her like that with a man. Right, Hyung?

699
00:54:33,410 --> 00:54:38,800
Ah, they are the wild abalones that were really hard for me to get, but a weasel-looking guy is eating them all.

700
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:43,900
Whether he looks a weasel or something, but he looks very decent even though I don't know whose family son is.

701
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:49,130
- Honestly, if you just look at their looks, Bok Joo is definitely lacking in that scene. 
 - Eat.

702
00:54:49,130 --> 00:54:52,260
It's clear that she likes him more.

703
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:55,090
What foolishness! What's wrong with my Bok Joo?

704
00:54:55,090 --> 00:54:58,870
Hey, I've got perfect 20/20 vision. How much better could it get?

705
00:54:58,870 --> 00:55:01,000
Shut up, bastard.

706
00:55:02,030 --> 00:55:05,190
Anyway, I don't like him.

707
00:55:05,190 --> 00:55:09,560
His gaze with which he is looking at Bok Joo is sticky and tricky.

708
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:12,580
Who? Him?

709
00:55:12,580 --> 00:55:17,240
From what I can see, he's in more danger. You can tell that Bok Joo likes him more just by looking.

710
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:19,230
What are you talking about? She said they were just friends.

711
00:55:19,230 --> 00:55:21,580
Do you give abalone to someone who is just a friend?

712
00:55:21,580 --> 00:55:25,040
Is our Bok Joo someone who would give up food to someone else?

713
00:55:25,070 --> 00:55:29,290
She's giving it to that guy because she likes him.

714
00:55:32,590 --> 00:55:34,410
Hey, where are we going?

715
00:55:34,410 --> 00:55:37,910
Hey, stop pestering me and just follow me.

716
00:55:42,510 --> 00:55:44,650
How pretty!

717
00:55:44,650 --> 00:55:46,030
Our neighborhood is pretty, isn't it?

718
00:55:46,030 --> 00:55:49,670
It's really pretty at nighttime. It's all sparkly.

719
00:55:49,670 --> 00:55:51,490
Yes.

720
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,890
It's pretty.

721
00:55:55,890 --> 00:56:01,750
But what's the cause of your start trauma?

722
00:56:01,750 --> 00:56:03,070
What?

723
00:56:03,070 --> 00:56:05,950
Ah, I heard from the doctor.

724
00:56:05,950 --> 00:56:09,840
Is it something like anxiety before the match or something?

725
00:56:11,780 --> 00:56:14,590
I don't know.

726
00:56:14,590 --> 00:56:18,070
How did you start swimming? Your parents made you?

727
00:56:18,070 --> 00:56:21,280
No. Because I liked the water.

728
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:26,080
I first learned swimming when I followed Hyung to a swimming pool one day,

729
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:28,090
and it was really comfortable and enjoyable for us.

730
00:56:28,110 --> 00:56:32,180
Something about it was warm, and it felt like it was embracing me.

731
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:35,720
Oh, you're pretty in touch with your emotional side.

732
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:38,670
So your personality changed after you started competing?

733
00:56:38,670 --> 00:56:42,740
It probably did.

734
00:56:42,740 --> 00:56:45,540
It did. That's right.

735
00:56:45,540 --> 00:56:47,290
That's why I started swimming,

736
00:56:47,290 --> 00:56:50,930
but I'm now feeling a burden from it that I never even imagined I would feel because it's my college major.

737
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:55,230
I have to be concerned with the time for swimming and get pushed,  like being forced into a cockfight.

738
00:56:55,230 --> 00:56:58,710
Without caring about being first place or second place,

739
00:56:58,710 --> 00:57:03,330
If I were told to just weight lift, then I'd really enjoy exercising.

740
00:57:03,330 --> 00:57:05,710
Hey, these damn rankings!

741
00:57:05,710 --> 00:57:09,250
Hey, you damn rankings!

742
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:16,250
But... When you look at it, isn't that part of being an athlete? We should just endure it.

743
00:57:20,650 --> 00:57:23,610
Hey! Cheer up!

744
00:57:23,610 --> 00:57:28,120
I've got a pretty good eye for people, and you're definitely going to succeed.

745
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:33,340
There's something strong in your gaze.

746
00:57:34,340 --> 00:57:36,650
Do you feel like you'll get sucked right into it?

747
00:57:36,650 --> 00:57:40,940
Yeah. Totally and deeply.

748
00:57:53,210 --> 00:57:55,940
It's pretty!

749
00:57:55,940 --> 00:57:59,130
If it's getting colder, you can't even come here.

750
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:03,890
Aigoo, our Bok Joo's stomach is probably exploding right about now.

751
00:58:03,890 --> 00:58:07,530
If she went because her father called her, then she'd at least eat some ginseng chicken soup.

752
00:58:07,530 --> 00:58:11,820
But when I look at Bok Joo, I can see that gaining weight really isn't easy.

753
00:58:11,850 --> 00:58:14,950
Of course not! Raising your weight class is way harder!

754

Bok Joo is having a really hard time gaining weight these days.

00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:11,890
Ah, with how I feel right now, I think I won't catch another cold for the next year!

758
00:59:11,890 --> 00:59:16,480
Wow, so this is why people go on and on about wild abalone.

759
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:20,320
- Do you feel a bit stronger?
- Yeah, it's shooting way up.

760
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:23,620
I was wondering where your amazing stamina came from. As expected.

761
00:59:23,620 --> 00:59:27,690
Let's eat together and cheer each other on. Athletics isn't something

762
00:59:27,690 --> 00:59:30,360
that you see results from in just one or two days.

763
00:59:30,360 --> 00:59:33,560
Your stamina has to be good for you to be able to fight mentally.

764
00:59:33,560 --> 00:59:37,570
How long are you going to live that absurd double life?

765
00:59:37,570 --> 00:59:42,630
I know, right? I'll have to end it soon.

766
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:51,290
Ah! Over there a toad!

767
00:59:51,290 --> 00:59:53,290
Ah, seriously! Do you want to die?

768
00:59:53,290 --> 00:59:57,620
For real! It's a toad this big! Ah, there it is, there it is!

769
00:59:57,620 --> 01:00:01,400
I should seriously just—! You're trying to have fun because you like reactions!

770
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:05,220
If you keep doing this, there is a chance you'd be dead.

771
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:11,760
Ah, you seriously don't believe me. I told you, there was a toad this big!

772
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:14,840
Swag!

773
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:17,610
Since earlier, you... That's not it!

774
01:00:17,610 --> 01:00:18,700
Swag.

775
01:00:18,700 --> 01:00:22,670
Swag. That's how you do it. Do it again.

776
01:00:22,710 --> 01:00:25,590
I'm saying you should try your best at it!

777
01:00:28,580 --> 01:00:30,720
Oh, you're here! You must be tired, right?

778
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:33,320
Hey, I organized your bed and your desk!

779
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:37,320
Hey, okay. Thank you.

780
01:00:37,320 --> 01:00:40,470
You're okay, right Joon Hyeong?

781
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:44,080
That's right. It's not like it was an important match. You just have to do well at the next one, that's all.

782
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:46,450
Did anyone say anything? I'm fine.

783
01:00:46,450 --> 01:00:49,320
But I wasn't disqualified today.

784
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:52,710
Right, punk. As I expected, you're broad-minded.

785
01:00:59,750 --> 01:01:03,180
It's when she does unexpected things that she's so cute.

You should eat the meatballs on a skewer.

788
01:01:37,060 --> 01:01:39,200
Bok Joo, do you want to eat more meatballs? I brought a lot.

789
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:43,260
- No, no. I'll take care of eating it myself. Thanks though.
- Okay.

790
01:01:43,260 --> 01:01:45,690
Hey, but I don't see Coach today.

791
01:01:45,690 --> 01:01:50,040
She was always stuck right by Bok Joo's side yelling, "One more tray!" at breakfast and lunchtime.

792
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:53,430
She must be oversleeping. Let's hurry up and finish eating. Otherwise, we'll be late for the class.

793
01:01:53,430 --> 01:01:55,170
 Father 

794
01:01:58,820 --> 01:02:01,910
Yeah, Dad. Why again? Did you make a beef soup this time?

795
01:02:01,910 --> 01:02:04,930
 Run over here right now. This instant. 

796
01:02:08,170 --> 01:02:11,190
Father,  why did you call me this early in the morning?

797
01:02:11,190 --> 01:02:15,180
Oh, why are you here, Professor? Coach?

01:02:20,260 --> 01:02:22,860
What is it?

800
01:02:25,240 --> 01:02:27,500
I asked what it is, wench!
