1
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:37,020


2
00:00:54,870 --> 00:01:00,770
  People ask me, "Why do you weightlift?" 

3
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:04,910
 When I was ten, I followed my father when he went to the weightlifting room. 

4
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:09,970
 I bizarrely liked the metallic smell of barbells that I smelled for the first time. 

5
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:15,170
  I thought to myself then, I would do weightlifting too. 

6
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:22,350
 Weightlifter Kim Bok Joo from Haneul Sports University is challenging the Clean &amp; Jerk 115 kg for the third time. 

7
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:24,050
 Haneul Sports University 

8
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:27,320
 I became a weight lifter at such a young age, and 

9
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:31,900
 I grew up together with weightlifting. 

10
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:36,370
  I have lifted the barbells and thrown them several thousand times.  

11
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:40,680
 I have scraped out calluses on my hands hundreds of times, 

12
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:47,970
 and I have poured out thousands of liters of sweat and tears 

13
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,720
 And now.... I am almost on stage! 

14
00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:02,060
 The third attempt of Kim Bok Joo from Haneul Sports University. 

15
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:04,460
That's what I'm saying.

16
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:07,280
I told you.

17
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:10,370
- Here's the marinated chicken. 
 - Look!

18
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:13,510
Aigoo, don't mind me but enjoy your chicken.

19
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:16,680
Ah, what the heck?

20
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:08,310
Gold medal! She got gold!

21
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:12,110
- Gold medal! Gold medal! 
 - She got the gold medal!

22
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:16,920
She's my daughter! My daughter!

23
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,940
- She is my niece!! 
 -  My daughter!

24
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:22,970
 The 96th National Weightlifting Competition 
 Weight Lifting Stadium 

25
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:29,330
Thank you! Thank you!

26
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,660
I enjoyed your performance. Let's see at Taerung Training Village (Korea National Training Center)

27
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:38,640
You are my role model. I'll work hard, Sunbae.

28
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,490
- Congrats! 
 - Thank you!

29
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:48,650
 I am a twenty-one year, in my blossoming year. 

30
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:51,560
 The Weightlifter Kim Bok Joo. 

31
00:03:57,550 --> 00:04:03,600
  This is from Olympia Swimming Pool, where the 35th Presidential Cup National Swimming Competition is held. 

32
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:08,950
 Right now, Men's Group B is swimming the 200 meter freestyle preliminary. 

33
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:10,650
 Take your mark! 

34
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:20,290
 Right now, in lane 5... 

35
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:23,030
 Swimmer Jeong Joon Hyeong from Haneul Sports University 

36
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:26,970
 is showing us a tremendous speed. What kind of swimmer is he? 

37
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:30,890
 Yes, that swimmer has a good record during practices, and he is a rising star. 

38
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:34,230
 In a previous competition, he was unfortunately disqualified due to an early start. 

39
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:39,090
 Right now, the first place at the Group B preliminary is Swimmer Jeong Joon Hyeong.  

40
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:41,330
 When I look at the record,  

41
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:47,370
 he is 0.15 second faster than Swimmer Choi Tae Woon in Group A who holds the Korea record. 

42
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:48,670
Yes!

43
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:52,650
 Episode 1 
 When you don't like food, you can give it to a dog, but when you don't like a person... 

44
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,750
One! One! Two!

45
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:01,000
One! Two! Three! Four!

46
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,890
One! Two! Three! Four!

47
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:04,630
One! Two! Three! Four!

48
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:06,170
One! Two! Three! Four!

49
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:09,730
Fighting!

50
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:13,050
Weightlifting Team! Fighting!

51
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:15,370
- Team! 
 - Fighting!

52
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:17,070
- Team! 
 - Fighting!

53
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:19,370
- Team! 
 - Fighting!

54
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:21,060
Look! Look!

55
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:24,350
Lift! Good!

56
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:26,800
Watch her.

57
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:30,780
Hey, Bok Joo. Just like that! Okay.

58
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:33,480
You should endure it. Lift your gaze.

59
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:36,920
That's right. You have to lift it straight up!

60
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:40,140
Your back leg is shaking.

61
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:42,060
Do you know that you're losing your endurance?

62
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:44,000
Do the strength work later.

63
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,390
You were zoning out  so you didn't do strength work earnestly.

64
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,830
Alright, let's stop the morning training here.

65
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:53,080
- Let's gather. 
 - Yes!

66
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,470
Gather here!

67
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:03,420
You worked hard. Let me request one thing as your professor-in-charge.

68
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:09,020
The end is just as important as the start.

69
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:12,570
When I was a weightlifter like you,

70
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:14,990
I turned on and turned off the lights of the weightlifting training room.  Why?

71
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:17,850
Because I didn't have the skill? Not at all!

72
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:20,430
The character as much as your inborn talent—

73
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:23,550
- What the professor's saying is to turn off the lights well, understand? 
  - Yes! 

74
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:26,600
- Attention! Bow! 
  - Goodbye! 

75
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,970
Go! Dismiss!

76
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:30,760
Let's go.

77
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:35,560
Athlete Lee, what's today's meal menu?

78
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:38,570
Stir-fried spicy pork, bean sprout soup, beans cooked in soy sauce, stir-fried anchovy.

79
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:41,660
- Ohh, stir-fried spicy pork! 
  - Be wanted! 

80
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:44,680
- Metal cooking plates! 
  - Be wanted! 

81
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,480
Then let's go to the metal cooking plates for the first time in a long time.

82
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:50,760
Attention here. Stop.

83
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:54,070
Today, there is an event at the small gym.

84
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:57,290
- What?! 
 - Again?

85
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:02,180
Seriously, why do we have to do this after every event? We aren't their slaves.

86
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:04,660
I mean, seriously. Are we the only muscles they can use?

87
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:09,280
In judo, shot-putting... rowing, too, the women players have thunder thighs.

88
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,310
They probably won one hundred of the gold medals at the last National Sports Game.

89
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:15,880
- Let's give it our all! 
 - Yes!

90
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:45,430
 Indeed, we eagerly look forward to seeing the race he will do against the champion in the final. 

91
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:53,470
 The swimmers are getting ready to take their places. 

92
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:58,130
 According to the prelim results, lane 4 is assigned to  Swimmer Jeong Joon Hyeong. 

93
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:02,380
 The left side,  lane 5 is assigned to Swimmer Choi Tae Woon. 

94
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:05,640
 Yes, that's right. Even though it's done with the results of prelim,  

95
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:09,190
  from Swimmer Choi Tae Woon's standpoint, he can't get out of his nervousness about it. 

96
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:12,350
 The final heat is very interesting. 

97
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:17,500
 Yes, now they have taken their places. 

98
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:20,450
 The men's 200 meter... 

99
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:36,420
 Take your mark! 

100
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:56,230
 Ah! Swimmer Jeong Joon Hyeong in lane four had a false start. 

101
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:59,050
 Will he be disqualified again because of this? 

102
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:00,760
 Yes, that's right. 

103
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,130
 He'll get disqualified over this. 

104
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:05,630
 He got caught with the same false start as his last competition. 

105
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:08,090
 How disappointing for Swimmer Jeong Joon Hyeong. 

106
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:24,830
Hey, Swimmer Jeong Joon Hyeong.

107
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:27,300
You know me, right? Choi Tae Woon.

108
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:30,690
I'm Choi Tae Woon's coach. Can we talk for a minute?

109
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:34,000
Aren't you already talking to me?

110
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,820
I have a favor to ask.

111
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:40,280
Could you be Tae Woon's personal training partner?

112
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,760
Be his personal training partner?

113
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:46,220
Our Tae Woon doesn't like training at Taerung.

114
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:49,360
So we're wondering if he should do some personal training.

115
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,760
I can enjoy training if I practice with someone in the similar level that's even a practice record.

116
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:57,550
It's good to give motivation to each other, kind of a win-win situation.

117
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,020
Ah, this is an honor.

118
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:07,660
When can a disqualified swimmer like me practice with a world-known swimming star like you?

119
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:13,760
But I sleep a lot in the early mornings, so it would be hard for me to do early morning training.

120
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,720
On the weekends, you have to rest.

121
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:19,300
Also, I'm picky about the water quality so we have to practice at my school pool.

122
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:22,200
Would you be able to adjust your practice to mine?

123
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,530
It won't do, right? It's fine, I thought so.

124
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,620
It's so heavy.

125
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:43,540
Aish, really.

126
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:44,870
Ah, so annoying!

127
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:47,580
Why do we have to do this all the time?

128
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,770
Until when...

129
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:52,170
- Ow. 
- It's not like they're paying us.

130
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:54,030
Come out, come out.

131
00:10:58,950 --> 00:10:59,860
Come out.

132
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:03,690
Hey, you guys. We need to lay out the chairs, will you move?

133
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:10,280
Hey, are you deaf? I said move, so we can lay out the chairs.

134
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,630
Hey!

135
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:18,600
Hey, hey, hey. Weightlifter.

136
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:24,060
Why are you disturbing someone in the middle of practice? Just lay out the chairs on this side first.

137
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,250
Yes.

138
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,470
They are going crazy.

139
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:31,590
Aigoo, how sad. They're so pitiful.

140
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:32,650
Who are you trying to pick a fight with?

141
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,670
Ahjumma, just lay out the chairs.

142
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:36,560
Did you see them laughing at us?

143
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,770
I am going to break those gymnasts' chopsticks!

144
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:44,030
Leave them alone. We have to be on the same physical level to have a proper conversation.

145
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:47,870
I knew it would happen.

146
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:51,420
Why did they bother us? I knew it.

147
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:52,890
How dare they to us?

148
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:56,220
Oh, sorry. Can you give me the ball?

149
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,270
Ah, sorry. I can't control my strength that well.

150
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:34,680
Ah, this is the last one. Ugh.

151
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:40,050
Ah, really.

152
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:48,990
- Bok Joo, are you okay?
 - Are you okay?

153
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:52,940
Can you stand up?

154
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:55,910
Look at her.

155
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:58,760
Those jerks.

156
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:02,200
Oh, human tsunami.

157
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:05,930
Get up.

158
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:31,020
I've already eaten but I'm still hungry!

159
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:34,150
- I should eat a sausage. 
- Hey, how many did you bring?

160
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:38,310
Give me one. Hey, Weightlifter Kim, cheer up already!

161
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:39,660
Just think like you stepped on dog poop (got bad luck).

162
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:44,770
Stepping on dog poop would be better! What an embarrassment.

163
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:48,280
Hey, should I just drop out? Or should I just stick my nose in a bowl of water and die?

164
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:54,100
Hey, hey, it's okay. Even if the rumors circulate today and tomorrow, they'll disappear soon.

165
00:13:56,340 --> 00:14:01,760
I'll be generous. Eat this lovely sausage and cheer up.

166
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,270
Yeah. Cheer up Bok Joo. She's making this much of an effort.

167
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:13,850
Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo! Milky skin Kim Bok Joo!

168
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:14,790
Stop it.

169
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:16,730
Sausage.

170
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:19,590
Shall I have a sausage, since two of weightlifters are asking so earnestly?

171
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:21,320
Of course.

172
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:30,880
If many of us went there...

173
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:34,030
How many do you have?

174
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:35,390
Oh no!

175
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:37,160
Oh!

176
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:40,890
Omo, Weightlifter Kim!

177
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:42,300
Are you okay?

178
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,890
Are you okay?

179
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:46,240
WHAT?

180
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:54,310
I thought I cut off a finger.

181
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,480
Are you all right?

182
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,200
I'm fine, but

183
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:07,410
I think my sausage just died.

184
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:10,870
You should've kept the proper speed in the school yard. Don't you know "keep eyes forward"?

185
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:14,030
Then do you want me to pray for the soul of the departed sausage?

186
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:16,340
What did you say "praying for"?

187
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:22,580
But have I seen you somewhere? You look familiar.

188
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:23,990
What?

189
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:27,960
I'm sure I've seen this face before...

190
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:37,920
That's because she participated in the National Games and the article about it came out on the bulletin board.

191
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:45,700
Anyhow, I apologize for this death but I also have a misfortune today, so...

192
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:51,830
Oh, excuse me, this may seem out of the blue in this situation,

193
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:55,860
but do you possibly like Messi?  (Famous Argentine soccer player) 

194
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:58,410
Pardon?

195
00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:01,070
Never mind, it's a bit sudden, right?

196
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:04,760
Then, please be careful on your way.

197
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,750
Depart!

198
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:11,410
Okay! Alright! Be careful.

199
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:14,620
Depart!

200
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:17,460
Aish, his way of talking is seriously annoying.

201
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:19,210
Maybe I should have gotten the price of the sausage out of him.

202
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:21,630
What's wrong? He's so fresh.

203
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:25,080
Don't you know him? He's the famous flower boy  swimmer.

204
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:28,130
Flower boy, my ass. I'm sure it's "common," not "flower boy".

205
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:29,910
His face is just common.

206
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:32,450
But what did you say to him earlier? Something about Messi?

207
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:35,400
"Excuse me, but do you like Messi?"

208
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,040
It's my best tip.

209
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:41,010
Men are attracted to women who have the same common interests as them.

210
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:42,780
What do guys like the most?

211
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:46,240
Sports. Among sports, soccer!

212
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:52,650
He'll want to have a glass of alcohol with a woman who like Messi.

213
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:55,670
That seems possible. Doesn't that seem convincing?

214
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:58,040
You're really passionate about blabbering nonsense.

215
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,950
Don't talk back what you're saying.

216
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:04,940
Aish, what do you mean, what nonsense am I saying? 
 "Do you like Messi?"

217
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:09,920
Ah, why am I so unlucky today?

218
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:14,200
Oh, I think that jerk dropped this.

219
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:22,550
Oh, look at this preferences. Is he a pervert or what?

220
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:27,930
Were you nervous before the match? Your thigh is so tense.

221
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:31,470
It's not that, but I was a bit startled because of Sausage.

222
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:32,770
Sausage?

223
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:34,880
There's something like that.

224
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,690
Aren't you putting your personal feelings into this?

225
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:45,290
Hey, I'm sorry but I don't feel anything for you.

226
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:50,170
That can't be. With a thigh like this, your heart should flutter a bit.

227
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:54,250
Aigoo, please try to make my heart flutter.

228
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:58,440
All done. Just be careful for today. And massage it once more before going to bed.

229
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:02,090
I understand. Thank you.

230
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:18,120
What's wrong? Are you looking for something?

231
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,160
No, no.

232
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:26,950
If you guys don't know, who does?

233
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:29,760
We're telling the truth. We gave you everything we pulled out of the washing machine.

234
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,290
You don't know what I went through to get that when I was in Canada.

235
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:36,390
By any chance, couldn't this be the work of that big pig?

236
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:37,140
What?

237
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:41,490
The Weightlifting Club. Their washing machine breaks easily, so they use ours often.

238
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:44,940
They put on a big show because we left one piece of laundry before. They're doing it again just like last time!

239
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,500
Hey, Weightlifters!

240
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,120
Yes?

241
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,950
Come here.

242
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,980
You're first years right?

243
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:55,860
Yes.

244
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:03,040
You guys, did you see my tights?

245
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,940
Did they not get mixed in with your laundry when you used our washing machine?

246
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:08,150
No, it didn't.

247
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:09,620
How could I believe that?

248
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:11,670
Hey, what are you doing with our kids?

249
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:14,170
- Sunbaenim!
 - Sunbaenim!

250
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:15,950
What is it?

251
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:20,040
This unni's clothes went missing, and she's telling us to give them.

252
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:24,920
We really didn't use RG's washing machine because they complain so much these days.

253
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:27,590
Is that true?

254
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:28,850
Yeah. I did.

255
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:29,700
Do you have any evidence?

256
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:30,910
Do you think I would make this up?

257
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:33,160
I asked, do you have evidence that our kids took it?

258
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:36,020
I don't have evidence but you have the previous convictions.

259
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:38,830
Is it once or twice that you used our washing machine?

260
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:41,960
This is nothing to do with the previous convictions. You need to have evidence.

261
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:48,260
That's why our society hasn't improved. Ex-convicts can't start their life anew at ease.

262
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:53,510
Don't uselessly bother our kids, got it?

263
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:57,570
Let's go, kids.

264
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:01,390
- Sunbaenim, you're the best!
 - Sunbaenim, you're the best!

265
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:03,630
Right?

266
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:18,730
It looks delicious.

267
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:21,170
Yeah!

268
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:27,190
Now, they're even labeling us as laundry thieves.

269
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:30,770
They're making their eyes like this. If they gave a sidelong scowl a little bit more, their eyes would be on the back of their heads.

270
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:34,230
Are we jinxed with those chopsticks? I wonder why we've gotten tangled up with them in everything.

271
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:38,530
Hey, our dark history with them goes much further back than just yesterday and today.

272
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:41,990
  This is all thanks to you. Let's keep this up and win. 

273
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:44,370
  Yes!
 Rhythmic Gymnastics Club 

274
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:45,270
 - Great job!
 - Wow! 

275
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:50,870
  -The RG Club's practice room they're using right now used to be our Weightlifting Club room.
Weightlifting Club 

276
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:56,620
Was it during the Asian Games? I heard that our seniors shed tears of blood after losing it to the RG Club who won Gold.

277
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:11,370
 - Wow! 
- Noona, I love you! 

278
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:12,550
  Is that a puppy or a bear? 

279
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:14,580
  Is she wearing that shirt or did she draw it on? 

280
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:15,900
  Is that all? 

281
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:19,990
  Every single time we have a field day, we're always put right next to each other and get humiliated. 

282
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:24,180
Still, that's nothing compared to the Goo Seul revolt last year.

283
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:26,700
Ah, Goo Seul revolt!

284
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:30,420
  Soo Sang! Soo Sang, you can hear me, right? 

285
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:35,150
  If you want, I won't put any chalk on my hands anymore (I'll quit weightlifting). I'll only touch powder for my face! 

286
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:37,410
  Seriously, what's the problem? 

287
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:41,430
  - Is this a problem? Don't you see this? 
- No, you're fine! 

288
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:44,690
  What's wrong?! 

289
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:47,980
  It's you, isn't it? It is you. 

290
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:49,710
 Unni! 

291
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:54,320
 This bad wench! You just have a mouth hole but no flesh at all. 

292
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:02,960
 You don't have even any size! 

293
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,630
 Aigoo! Really! 

294
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:08,820
Unni Goo Seul almost made a boyfriend after one year of effort,

295
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:11,460
but RG Club seduced him. Ugh!

296
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,590
In the end, that unni was kicked out of the dorms.

297
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:16,320
After that shock, she couldn't even remember well.

298
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,690
That's what I'm saying. To me, she was a very promising rhythmic gymnast.

299
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:22,270
Anyway, those RG people are aggravating. They don't give up anything at all.

300
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:26,630
Bok Joo, we're out of chicken.

301
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:28,600
Huh? Okay.

302
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:32,860
Ah! Uncle!

303
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:35,080
You should stop eating now. This is already your 4th chicken.

304
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:37,510
- It's our 3rd! 
- It's our 3rd!

305
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:40,170
I'm sorry. I committed a sin worthy of death.

306
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:43,710
Eat until your stomachs burst, Do, Mi, and Sol.

307
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:45,000
- Why hit us? 
- Why hit us?

308
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,550
Then at least pay before you eat!

309
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:48,330
Please leave immediately.

310
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:50,650
Is this a chicken grave?!

311
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:54,260
Hey, hey, hey! Bok Joo, we have 10 minutes before they take attendance! 10 minutes! Hurry up!

312
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:56,970
- Go, hurry!
 - Ah, oh my god!

313
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:01,180
Wow...

314
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,640
Why are you here? Isn't it almost time for night attendance?

315
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,840
Goodbye!

316
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,160
Yeah, yeah...

317
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:10,560
Ah Dad! I told you to make Hae Too do the delivery. I'll go to the hospital--

318
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:13,530
What is that? Dad, you picked that up on the street again, didn't you?

319
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:17,980
Someone threw this perfectly fine thing away. It was clean on the inside too.

320
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:20,570
They must have thrown it away because it can't make rice anymore! What are you going to use that for?

321
00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:24,850
Why wouldn't I have a use for this, you rascal? I can put chicken in here for delivery

322
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:27,000
and that, what is that...

323
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,050
Even when you think about it, it doesn't make sense, right?

324
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,380
Hey, be quiet! Hurry up and leave!

325
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:35,130
Shove that chicken into your mouth with moderation!

326
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:37,070
Don't you have anything to do? Leave! Don't come tomorrow either!

327
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:40,090
Just throw that away, Dad. I'll see you at the hospital. Bye!

328
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:41,430
- Hurry!
 - Hurry up!

329
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:45,060
Hey, run slower! You'll get hurt!

330
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:48,810
Ugh! Those pretty kids.

331
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:52,330
Aigoo, run!

332
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:54,660
Come on!

333
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:58,480
Ugh, let's do some laundry.

334
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,430
Ah, I smell sweat.

335
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:04,370
What's wrong?

336
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:07,130
I just thought something was there.

337
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:09,690
What's there? Nothing's there.

338
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:11,880
Really?

339
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:14,530
Let's go.

340
00:24:25,290 --> 00:24:28,860
We'll start taking attendance.  Team Captain, please come to the head resident's room.

341
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:30,780
Hey, haven't you seen a handkerchief?

342
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:33,320
A handkerchief, my ass. Just clean up.

343
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:36,360
Hey, hurry up! Gi Seok will be here to check soon.

344
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:39,910
Ah, where could that have gone? Did I leave that at home?

345
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:46,590
Hey, hey, hey, hey! He's right next-door, next-door!

346
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,800
You two are in charge of the stairs, right?

347
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:06,430
Did you mop?

348
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:09,170
Of course, Sunbae.

349
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:12,860
You left alone in the middle of the competition.

350
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:14,170
My condition wasn't good.

351
00:25:14,170 --> 00:25:17,170
What's to brag about being disqualified?

352
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:18,510
I told the coach before I left.

353
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:22,910
That's why I'm saying this. You don't think about your teammates or comrades, do you?

354
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:25,990
You only think about yourself, right?

355
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:28,430
After listening to your words, I think I was wrong.

356
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:30,610
After listening?

357
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:32,790
This bastard, seriously...

358
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:35,930
Team Captain, what are you doing? Do you want to spend the night here?

359
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:38,250
Yes, I'm coming!

360
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,970
Good work.

361
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,860
Ugh!

362
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:54,290
That sociopath, seriously! Every time he sees you, he can't wait to scold you.

363
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:57,180
I have a character that aggravates people.

364
00:25:57,210 --> 00:26:00,760
Imagine if you were a senior. Would you adore a junior who does whatever he wants?

365
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:03,520
Aw, you even made an anti-fan. You amazing rascal.

366
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:07,120
Was I too perfect? Too perfect to be a human?

367
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:10,290
Such a perfect bastard got disqualified again? Again?!

368
00:26:10,290 --> 00:26:15,060
You're even worse than me, who placed 5th place. Just go, go out and die.

369
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:17,860
Fine! I feel refreshed after hearing you curse me out!

370
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:20,040
This bastard.

371
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:22,700
Aish!

372
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,990
Hey, forget that. Let's go out.

373
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:28,260
Let's go play some games.

374
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:31,970
Night attendance is over. Where would we go, you crazy bastard?

375
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:35,950
Come on! This is amazing!

376
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:40,490
Oh, Min Kyung! It's been a while. I haven't seen you before.

377
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:44,140
Wow, cheers! Here, have a drink. Here.

378
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:47,570
Cheers! Woo!

379
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:53,750
You're the swimmer, aren't you?

380
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:56,640
Wow, your shoulders are amazing.

381
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,010
I saw you on Hye Jin's SNS (social media).

382
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:03,940
Um, could you please give me your number?

383
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:07,170
My mom took my phone away.

384
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:09,230
My grades dropped recently

385
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:12,210
and she thought that was because of women...

386
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:14,260
Goodbye.

387
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:19,120
Hey! Hey, where are you going?

388
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,740
Hey!

389
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:30,180
Joon Hyeong! You're going to eat, right? I'll set a place for you.

390
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:32,830
Of course! Just a minute, Mom!

391
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:43,080
Where the heck did you go?

392
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,790
Good morning.

393
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:47,700
Hey, you're out early.

394
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,070
Get in. I'll give you a ride.

395
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:52,370
Forget it. I'll just run there.

396
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:57,060
Just take the car. You must have had a hard time because of the competition.

397
00:27:58,390 --> 00:28:01,020
Now you're talking about the competition?

398
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:05,860
Both Mom and Dad must have been so curious to ask, but neither of them said a word about the competition.

399
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:07,720
I guess acting cool is a genetic trait in our family.

400
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:10,660
Out of all of us, you're the most upset. There's no need for us to bring that up.

401
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:14,050
Yes, I deviated for the night because I was so upset

402
00:28:14,050 --> 00:28:15,970
and since I can't be cool about it, I'll leave now.

403
00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:20,140
I don't know if you'll be able to catch your younger brother with this crappy car.

404
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,370
What are you doing? Why aren't you following me?

405
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:26,360
Oh? Look at this.

406
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:29,870
Hey, Lee Seon Ok. You must be so excited, you gained 2 kilograms.

407
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:32,060
Um, I ate some chicken last night so...

408
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:40,570
Wow, you'll suffer big time right before the competition if you just eat whatever you want like this.

409
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:41,900
I told you this before, didn't I?

410
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:44,300
When the Olympics were held in Atlanta, in America,

411
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:47,960
when I had to change the weight class division suddenly and to reduce 3 kg in one week,

412
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:53,390
I starved myself, and at the sauna, I sweated out the rest of the pounds and barely made the needed weight.

413
00:28:53,390 --> 00:28:55,920
And in any case, that's for someone like me, who looks after their body with extreme care. However--

414
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,200
- Hey! 
- Oh, that scared me.

415
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:01,030
You rascals, this is why we're telling you to take care of your body early on. Hold back on the meat.

416
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:03,000
- Yes!
 - Yes!

417
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,560
Aigoo, Trainer Yook!

418
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,910
- Oh?
 - Hello.

419
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:07,820
- Hello.
 - Kids, hello.

420
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:09,100
Hehe.

421
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:11,090
What brings you all the way here?

422
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:15,640
Someone ordered some chicken but cancelled their order and I couldn't think of anyone else to give it to.

423
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:18,630
Goodness, you don't have to do this. I have no words.

424
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:21,530
What are you talking about? You're making me upset.

425
00:29:21,530 --> 00:29:24,370
Who's the one who created the Bok Joo of today?

426
00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:26,240
She was tall and had long limbs

427
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:30,560
so she was wondering whether she should give up weightlifting, but you assured her that it was possible.

428
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:33,860
You told her that it was possible with her love for weightlifting. Do I have to list every single one of my thanks--

429
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:36,500
Applause!

430
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:39,810
- Thank you for the food!
 - We'll eat well.

431
00:29:39,810 --> 00:29:42,730
- Thank you for the food!
 - Thank you!

432
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:45,650
Let's go.

433
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:48,280
Why did you come here? I would have gone to the hospital later.

434
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:51,000
  You have to work some magic like this occasionally. 

435
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,690
  Do you know how much he looked after your comfort? 

436
00:29:54,690 --> 00:29:57,070
Ah, Professor Yoon! Eat with them, go eat!

437
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:59,820
I fried the middle size of chickens, not small ones.

438
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:01,700
Yes, I'll eat well.

439
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:05,830
Bok Joo. Since your father is here, you should escort him to the hospital.

440
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:10,760
Night practice is just individual practice anyway. Go on.

441
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,630
Thank you.

442
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:46,380
Hyung, Hyung! I think I have to leave for a bit.

443
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:49,590
Um, Jong Gi's father passed away.

444
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:51,560
You know him, my army comrade, right?

445
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:54,330
Of course, I know.

446
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:55,850
Huh?

447
00:30:55,850 --> 00:31:00,030
But you know... Jong Gi's father

448
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:04,420
will be so happy you came in sparkly clothes.

449
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:08,290
What is it this time? A nighttime singer?

450
00:31:08,290 --> 00:31:10,890
I'll go change.

451
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:13,290
Ugh, that lacking fool.

452
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:15,740
If he's going to put up an act, he should do it properly.

453
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:19,910
He only takes a role of the extra who doesn't speak one word all the time.

454
00:31:43,050 --> 00:31:45,330
Okay, nice!

455
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:48,280
Your turn is good, Joon Hyeong. You're doing well.

456
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:51,260
Gi Seok, don't slack off.

457
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:07,180
Calluses.

458
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:09,980
Hey, hey, look. These are my scars of honor.

459
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:21,100
- You came, Weightlifter Kim?
 - You came?

460
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:27,400
Ah, why are you two always doing this in my room? The smell!

461
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,860
Even if you color your nails, the polish will just peel off if you weightlift.

462
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:32,260
I don't know why you slather it on.

463
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:35,870
It's not coloring, it's nail art.

464
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:39,360
Art, my ass. Just take off the calluses of your hands.

465
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:42,240
Don't cry after they come off all bloody when you're lifting barbells.

466
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:46,020
Hey, hey. Leave her alone. She has the same intention as " Do you like Messi?"

467
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:50,500
Hey, don't try to appeal to a man with these things but cultivate your inner side.

468
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,340
That's faster!

469
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:55,760
To be honest, we're much more charming than those RG kids.

470
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,060
We have good personalities, right?

471
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:59,760
We have amazing life skills, right?!

472
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,920
And we have this much glamor. Is there anything else to say?

473
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:06,180
- As expected, Kim Bok Joo's glamor is swag. 
- Swag.

474
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:09,990
Whenever I look at you, you're so positive. You have so much confidence.

475
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:13,890
You know, I don't know if that's confidence or bluff.

476
00:33:13,890 --> 00:33:18,310
Nan Hee, out. Leave. Go to your own room!

477
00:33:22,330 --> 00:33:23,510
Where did it go?

478
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:24,650
- Why?
 - What?

479
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:27,630
My cotton T-shirt I wore during my last competition, it's not here.

480
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:29,230
Where could that have gone?

481
00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:31,230
Where did it go?

482
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:33,920
Really? You really don't know where my cotton T-shirt is?

483
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:37,020
Yes. I'm sure I saw it when I did the laundry.

484
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:38,970
Ah, this can't happen.

485
00:33:38,970 --> 00:33:43,520
I wore that when I won gold in the last competition, so I have to wear it again for my next one.

486
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,130
It's not here, I can't find it.

487
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:49,020
It's not in our room and I asked all of the other rooms, but they don't have it either.

488
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:52,690
What will you do, Weightlifter Kim? You need to wear that for your competition.

489
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:57,000
Ah, I'm doomed. Without that shirt, I won't be able to win the medal either.

490
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:01,690
Um, by any chance, this is just a guess...

491
00:34:01,690 --> 00:34:05,560
Isn't it possible the RG Club took it with the intent of getting revenge?

492
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:08,940
Ah, they said that we're the ones who took their clothes, so

493
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:11,490
on purpose they—

494
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:14,510
No... wait, Bok Joo! It was just a guess!

495
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:17,940
Hey, don't you know that she acts first and then thinks?!

496
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:18,960
Hey, Bok Joo!

497
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:22,800
I can just take a guess, can't I?!

498
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:29,150
What did we do to your clothes? We deliberately stole it?

499
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,800
- Did you not?
 - Are you crazy?

500
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:35,300
Why would we? What use would we have for that unfitting smelly rag?

501
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:37,700
You said that we were the ones who took your clothes

502
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:39,960
but you have no evidence, so out of anger—

503
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:42,140
We stole your clothes as revenge?

504
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:44,220
I'm about to go crazy.

505
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:47,680
- I guess she thinks we're as immature as they are.
 - I know.

506
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:50,610
Do you have evidence? You were the one who said evidence was the most important.

507
00:34:50,610 --> 00:34:54,250
Yeah, so I'm going to look for some evidence.

508
00:34:54,250 --> 00:34:55,820
Let me see your rooms for a minute.

509
00:34:55,820 --> 00:35:00,110
No. Why do I have to show you my room? Why?

510
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:03,570
I have to find those clothes. Move.

511
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:07,490
What's wrong with you? Seriously, what are you doing?

512
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:11,780
Those are my lucky clothes. I have to find them.

513
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:14,370
I said no!

514
00:35:14,370 --> 00:35:16,620
You'll get hurt, move!

515
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:19,980
- Ah, seriously!
 - Why are you like this?!

516
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:23,610
- Ah, I got it!
 - Move!

517
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:28,750
- Unni! 
- Unni!

518
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:35,230
 Health Care Center 

519
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:43,340
Who said you could relax now? Arms straight!

520
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:45,190
Bok Joo, get up.

521
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:52,830
What is this? Hey, are you a gangster?

522
00:35:52,830 --> 00:35:57,030
Or like the other students say, are you a human bulldozer? Why would you hit someone with the strength you use to lift a barbell?

523
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:59,190
No, I was wrong.

524
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:03,600
Ah, is that the reason why you strengthen your upper body and exercise so much?

525
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,410
- But what happened today was—
 - Don't make excuses.

526
00:36:05,410 --> 00:36:08,720
You've already caused the accident and excuses like that don't work anymore.

527
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:11,490
Behave properly. Hey, we're the club that uses our strength.

528
00:36:11,490 --> 00:36:15,560
If you mess up, the entire club will be blamed. Understand?

529
00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:33,430
Professor.

530
00:36:33,430 --> 00:36:38,070
It seems her muscle was overused. She has to be careful for 2-3 weeks.

531
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:39,790
What you did was so unlike you, why?

532
00:36:39,790 --> 00:36:42,180
I didn't do that on purpose, Coach.

533
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:46,150
She blocked me from entering her room so I just slightly pushed her and...

534
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:48,740
I'm telling the truth! I didn't use any strength.

535
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:50,600
Yeah, I know.

536
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:55,430
But you should still apologize. From now on, avoid contact with the RG Club as much as possible.

537
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:56,960
Ugh, seriously.

538
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:00,060
Goodness.

539
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:03,250
Hey, the professor apologized profusely to Coach Seong.

540
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:06,820
He's doing that in case problems arise in the future, so just do as he tells you.

541
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:13,290
I'm sorry.

542
00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:17,300
What? I can't hear you at all.

543
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:23,040
I said I'm sorry! I'm sorry. Happy now?

544
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:27,300
I don't know. Ah,

545
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:31,230
I'll look at your behavior from now on and decide whether I'll forgive you or not.

546
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:32,970
  Let's go. 

547
00:37:34,870 --> 00:37:38,560
Wow, those people are jerks.

548
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,870
I can't help it because I got so furious.

549
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:48,610
Come on.

550
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:07,490
Here you go. Yeah. 
♬   How can I get your love   ♬

551
00:38:07,490 --> 00:38:10,900
Let's drink here until drunk.

552
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:18,330
Cheers! 
♬   How can I make you smile  ♬

553

♬   This heart-throbbing excitement   ♬

554
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:26,560
Today was a really long day. 
 ♬  colors my feelings   ♬

555
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,630
What is all this drama over a single laundry machine?

556
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:33,040
Anyway, what are we going to do about your cotton T-shirt, Bok Joo? You said that was your lucky T-shirt.

557
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,830
Aish! RG, those jerks!

558
00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:41,660
Our dad's words are right. "When you don't like food, you can give it to the dog but when you don't like a person..."

559
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:46,100
Hey, you rascals! Is having a pretty face and being popular everything?!

560
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:47,990
You have to become humane first.

561
00:38:47,990 --> 00:38:49,180
She's right!

562
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:53,280
We both have smelly breath in the morning when we wake up!

563
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,940
Don't act up, you rascals!

564
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:58,680
Still, we are C-cup size and you're flat.

565
00:38:58,680 --> 00:38:59,820
Even the expression of flat is too much for them.

566
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:02,430
  Ugh, it's so loud! You're the weightlifting club, aren't you?! 

567
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:03,690
No.

568
00:39:03,690 --> 00:39:06,270
We're the Judo Team.

569
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:15,200
♬   I don't know where this feeling came from   ♬

570
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:23,470
Bok Joo, if both Song Joong Ki and Kim Soo Hyun asked you out at the same time, what would you do?
  ♬   There's a small quake only known to me   ♬

571
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:24,760
Can't I date both at the same time?

572
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:29,170
Hey, you wench! Have a conscience. You can't choose to eat both meat and sushi at the same time.

573
00:39:29,170 --> 00:39:33,600
Hey, why can't I? I've lived my entire life being cautious of others and yielding.

574
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:37,630
I don't think this is something to fight over. Look up at the sky.

575
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:41,570
The weather is so nice.

576
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:44,630
Hey Jeong Nan Hee, where's the fish jerky we bought?

577
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:45,730
You all ate it all last time.

578
00:39:45,730 --> 00:39:47,290
- Hey, I didn't eat that much!
 - I didn't eat it!

579
00:39:47,290 --> 00:39:49,680
I really didn't eat it! You always blame me.

580
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,540
Aish, I'm so hungry.

581
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:53,590
You didn't say clearly in the end.

582
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:55,150
Fine, I ate it.

583
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:56,810
Go buy some more!

584
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:00,400
Ah, Joon Hyeong! Let's go out.

585
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,120
Let's go out!

586
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:06,390
Head resident went to bed and I checked Hyung Gi Seok also went to bed.

587
00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:09,690
I don't want to. I'm tired today.

588
00:40:09,690 --> 00:40:12,690
Just one hour. Let's just play some games for exactly one hour.

589
00:40:12,690 --> 00:40:15,220
Friend...

590
00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:20,300
It's not even two hours or three hours, but just one hour...

591
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:24,640
I just want to play games for just one hour, yet you just don't listen. You're making me upset!

592
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:28,200
- Goodness! I'm so upset, I feel so wronged! 
- Aish!

593
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,830
Ugh! You're bothering me so much, you bastard.

594
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:32,280
If you keep doing this, I might ask the teacher to give me a different room.

595
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,990
You're still going out now, right?

596
00:40:33,990 --> 00:40:35,490
Yeah, let's go. Let's go, you bastard.

597
00:40:35,490 --> 00:40:38,700
Joon Hyeong, I love you. Honey, I love you.

598
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:40,670
Don't do it.

599
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:43,830
Aish, get away.

600
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:50,840
 Who's there? 

601
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:54,040
What, who's there? Stop!

602
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:04,040
Just where did they go?

603
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:07,560
Did she leave?

604
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:09,340
She left, she left.

605
00:41:25,410 --> 00:41:28,550
Pervert! Pervert!

606
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:30,420
Pervert! Catch him!

607
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:32,880
Hey, catch him! Pervert! Pervert!

608
00:41:34,690 --> 00:41:37,540
Hey, where are you going!?

609
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:49,170
Hey! Come down.

610
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:03,860
What? What is that? Hey, hurry up and come down. Hurry up!

611
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:11,400
Hey, you perverted bastard!

612
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:15,960
Hey! He's here, he's here! I caught the pervert!

613
00:42:16,770 --> 00:42:18,520
- I caught the pervert!
 - Let go of me!

614
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:20,290
Let go!

615
00:42:20,290 --> 00:42:22,210
- Let go of me! Let go!
 - Where do you think you're going, you perverted bastard?!

616
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:26,260
- Hey, hey! Where do you think you're going?!
 - Let go of me! Hey!

617
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:28,650
- Hey! Hey!
 - Pervert!

618
00:42:28,650 --> 00:42:30,570
- Hey, hey, hey! Aish!
 - Pervert!

619
00:42:30,570 --> 00:42:32,990
- I caught him!
 - Hey!

620
00:42:32,990 --> 00:42:34,890
I caught him!

621
00:42:34,890 --> 00:42:36,330
I'm telling you it's not me.

622
00:42:36,330 --> 00:42:38,350
It is him. I saw him clearly.

623
00:42:38,350 --> 00:42:40,980
What are you talking about?

624
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:44,630
I just sneaked out to go to a PC room but then she suddenly appeared and...

625
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:48,170
I mean, if I like someone, I can just date them. Why would I steal female clothing?

626
00:42:48,170 --> 00:42:49,910
That's why you're abnormal.

627
00:42:49,910 --> 00:42:53,680
I clearly saw you. I have perfect eyesight.

628
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,650
- I'm about go nuts, seriously!
 - Um,

629
00:42:55,650 --> 00:42:58,490
even if you saw him, there's no evidence that he's the pervert.

630
00:42:58,490 --> 00:43:01,860
And to be honest, he's not the type to do that even though he jokes around a bit.

631
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:04,820
For now, let's settle this here.

632
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:07,040
Alright, well...

633
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:10,760
Hey, you rascal. Be prepared to receive demerit points.

634
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:15,870
Ah, but how did those people get past the security? I have to change it something else or something.

635
00:43:15,870 --> 00:43:19,660
You can't just let him go! He's really a strange kid!

636
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:23,370
He even carries around a lace handkerchief, a girl's handkerchief.

637
00:43:23,370 --> 00:43:24,920
  What? 

638
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:28,020
  You perverted bastard. 

639
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:37,260
Give me my handkerchief.

640
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:40,250
You should give me my cotton T-shirt.

641
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:45,650
Why are you asking me for your cotton T-shirt?

642
00:43:45,650 --> 00:43:48,690
Then I can't give you your handkerchief either.

643
00:43:52,490 --> 00:43:55,590
Fine, let's do this.

644
00:44:06,130 --> 00:44:07,950
I warned you, didn't I?

645
00:44:07,950 --> 00:44:11,990
I told you that you would be caught red-handed big time. You slimy bastard.

646
00:44:13,130 --> 00:44:16,390
Do you know why I hate you so much?

647
00:44:17,470 --> 00:44:19,710
Because you think you're so amazing.

648
00:44:19,710 --> 00:44:23,690
I can see that conceitedness in your face, but don't misunderstand.

649
00:44:23,690 --> 00:44:29,020
What's the use of breaking a record during training? You have a fragile mentality that always breaks whenever it's time for a competition.

650
00:44:33,310 --> 00:44:39,600
People like you, who aren't terrible but aren't amazing, are the worst.

651
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:41,690
Know your place before you act up.

652
00:44:41,690 --> 00:44:45,280
Make sure you jump 100 times, have a conscience.

653
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:01,300
Ugh, this is hard!

654
00:45:38,210 --> 00:45:40,190
Joon Hyeong!

655
00:45:40,190 --> 00:45:44,100
Joon Hyeong! Joon Hyeong! Joon Hyeong!

656
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:47,940
Hey, Joon Hyeong! I'm sorry, I was wrong! Joon Hyeong! Joon Hyeong!

657
00:45:48,510 --> 00:45:50,150
Hey, get up.

658
00:45:50,770 --> 00:45:52,420
Are you okay? Are you okay?

659
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:53,960
Hey,

660
00:45:54,770 --> 00:45:56,560
- Water.
 - Water? Water.

661
00:45:56,560 --> 00:46:01,470
Alright, I got it. I'll get you premium luxurious foreign water... Wait, do I have some spare change?

662
00:46:01,470 --> 00:46:04,100
Hey, I'll go...I'll go the fountain and get some change quickly—

663
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:09,800
You're terrible at everything!

664
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:12,020
Hey, Joon Hyeong! Joon Hyeong!

665
00:46:12,490 --> 00:46:15,600
Ah, Hyungnim. Hyungnim, I'm sorry. Are you okay?

666
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:17,830
- I didn't mean to do that but—
 - Let go!

667
00:46:19,130 --> 00:46:21,690
Joon Hyeong. Joon Hyeong, I-I was wrong.

668
00:46:21,690 --> 00:46:23,520
Why are you doing this to me!?

669
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,580
I committed a sin worthy of death, Joon Hyeong!

670
00:46:25,580 --> 00:46:28,550
Forget it. I'll go get the water myself.

671
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:53,650
Let's see, let's see.

672
00:47:00,970 --> 00:47:05,290
Thank you. I will use this well.

673
00:47:12,390 --> 00:47:16,300
You're a habitual thief.

674
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:20,830
I was wondering where all of the coins the students threw into the fountain disappeared to.

675
00:47:20,830 --> 00:47:22,120
Don't throw them into the wishing fountain.

676
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:25,610
That's littering coins. Do you know how many coins are thrown away each year?

677
00:47:25,610 --> 00:47:28,720
I'm doing all of this for the environment.

678
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:32,290
Is that so? You're such an amazing environmentalist.

679
00:47:32,290 --> 00:47:35,010
Forget it. Give me back my handkerchief.

680
00:47:35,780 --> 00:47:37,530
Me?

681
00:47:37,530 --> 00:47:40,810
To you, Mr. Pervert? Why?

682
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:47,720
Hey, give it back while I'm being nice.

683
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:49,780
Hey, Sausage!

684
00:47:53,020 --> 00:47:55,630
- Hwaiting!
 - Hwaiting!

685
00:47:55,630 --> 00:47:57,810
 Weightlifting!
 Fighting!   

686
00:47:57,810 --> 00:48:00,790
- Hwaiting!

687
00:48:03,610 --> 00:48:05,760
 Weightlifting!
 Fighting!   

688
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:07,230
Hey! Give me back my handkerchief!

689
00:48:07,230 --> 00:48:09,860
Give me back my shirt first!

690
00:48:09,860 --> 00:48:12,200
Joon Hyeong, don't you come here quickly?!

691
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:24,130
  Female Dormitory 

692
00:48:25,970 --> 00:48:27,630
  Death penalty. 

693
00:48:29,870 --> 00:48:32,580
That's not just a regular handkerchief. Give it back now.

694
00:48:32,580 --> 00:48:36,260
My shirt isn't just a regular T-shirt either. It's special too.

695
00:48:36,260 --> 00:48:40,890
Hey, you're going to be so sorry towards me in the future. What will you do? It'll be less difficult for you if you just give it up now.

696
00:48:40,890 --> 00:48:43,700
I wish I could be sorry towards you.

697
00:48:50,420 --> 00:48:54,920
  2017 Rhythmic Gymnastics National Representative Audition 

698
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:22,600
 The next competitor will use a ribbon. Competitor 5, Song Si Ho. 

699
00:49:26,770 --> 00:49:31,630
 2017 Rhythmic Gymnastics National Representative Audition, the first round. 

700
00:49:31,630 --> 00:49:37,620
 A 3rd year at Haneol Sports College, this is Song Si Ho's ribbon performance. 

701
00:49:38,340 --> 00:49:42,060
 The music selected is Ivan's Tango. 

702
00:50:00,910 --> 00:50:02,370
 2017 Rhythmic Gymnastics National Representative Audition 

703
00:50:54,010 --> 00:50:57,820
What kind of school has so many events?!

704
00:50:57,820 --> 00:51:00,570
Speaking of which, I have to find my lucky T-shirt.

705
00:51:00,570 --> 00:51:04,800
Hey, you know that swimmer... Are you sure he's a pervert?

706
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:08,760
I mean, there's no way someone who looks like that would be a pervert.

707
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:15,740
Again, again! You concentrate too much on visuals, you wench. You can't be fooled by that face.

708
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:18,290
But even I think he's not like that.

709
00:51:18,290 --> 00:51:21,630
Well, it's not as if I would frame him out of ill intentions.

710
00:51:21,630 --> 00:51:22,720
Bicycle.

711
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:26,980
- Sausage.
 - Ah, seriously, what do you see me as?!

712
00:51:26,980 --> 00:51:28,360
Ah, I don't know either!

713
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:29,700
The icon of thoughtlessness.

714
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:33,700
If you want to know about me, you have to go a long way.  Hey, you go quickly!

715
00:51:47,580 --> 00:51:51,100
- Ah, sorry!
 - Sunbae, quickly! Hurry, hurry!

716
00:51:51,130 --> 00:51:53,980
Hurry up! Hurry!

717
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:56,340
- Move aside! 
- Ugh!

718
00:51:58,030 --> 00:52:03,800
Hey, hey, hey! How can you place the chairs like this? You have to stack them up neatly in the corner over there.

719
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:07,410
Ah, you guys have no common sense.

720
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:12,770
Tell them to bring all the boys back!

721
00:52:14,610 --> 00:52:16,330
Oh!

722
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:20,380
Excuse me...

723
00:52:21,510 --> 00:52:23,310
What is it?

724
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:31,450
You saw?

725
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:39,960
- Ah, let go!
 - Let go!

726
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:43,350
- Hey, you pervert! Let go!
 - Pervert!

727
00:53:01,740 --> 00:53:04,290
Stick it to your ear. That's right.

728
00:53:04,290 --> 00:53:08,980
Raise up, and take off your hand. Get your balance. That a girl.

729
00:53:08,980 --> 00:53:12,180
Nice job. Press down more.

730
00:53:12,180 --> 00:53:16,770
Unni, you received your clothes, right? That old man is seriously sick.

731
00:53:16,770 --> 00:53:19,430
I know. We didn't know and just framed the Weightlifting Club.

732
00:53:19,430 --> 00:53:22,320
We both misunderstood each other so just pretend that nothing happened.

733
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:24,910
You two, don't yield to them just because you're sorry.

734
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:29,310
Oh, who's talking?! Concentrate on stretching your body!

735
00:53:29,310 --> 00:53:31,910
Dani, press your heel down more. Continue.

736
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:38,190
Yi Seul, your heel is turning. Press down.
 Haneol Sports College 

737
00:53:38,190 --> 00:53:41,070
Coach, Si Ho Unni is here.

738
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:47,590
- Is he the one?
 - He stole female clothing?

739
00:53:47,590 --> 00:53:49,570
- Old man, what are you looking at? Huh?
 - What is he staring at?

740
00:53:49,570 --> 00:53:51,190
- Someone like him exists?
 - Ugh, pervert.

741
00:53:51,190 --> 00:53:52,800
- How can there be someone like that?
 - What in the world?

742
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:53,760
- Perverted bastard
 - Ugh.

743
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:56,280
- He shouldn't do that.
 - Pervert.

744
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:58,000
Hey! Let's go! Hurry!

745
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,620
- In the future, you should tell sunbaes...
 - Ah, seriously...

746
00:54:00,620 --> 00:54:02,880
I feel lost.

747
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:06,610
They always say that the darkest place is under the candlestick. You just never know by how they look.

748
00:54:06,610 --> 00:54:08,270
Let's go.

749
00:54:08,270 --> 00:54:10,290
Come on, Bok Joo.

750
00:54:23,620 --> 00:54:25,410
Hey, what should we eat?

751
00:54:27,710 --> 00:54:30,610
Hey, not that!

752
00:54:36,030 --> 00:54:41,450
Why did that jerk jump in at that moment of all times and put me in this awkward situation...

753
00:54:41,450 --> 00:54:45,300
What do I do...

754
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:48,580
I'm sorry, but can you open the door for me?

755
00:54:51,750 --> 00:54:53,510
Thank you.

756
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:16,930
Are you in room 302 too?

757
00:55:17,770 --> 00:55:19,700
Y-Y-Yes.

758
00:55:20,370 --> 00:55:24,270
Nice to meet you. I'm Song Si Ho, a 3rd year at RG Club.

759
00:55:24,270 --> 00:55:27,100
I'm going to share this room with you.

760
00:55:28,670 --> 00:55:32,870
Only this room is available. I just came back from Taereung because I failed to make the cut for the national team.

761
00:55:32,870 --> 00:55:35,650
I'm looking forward to staying with you well.

762
00:55:42,420 --> 00:55:43,780
Hey,

763
00:55:43,780 --> 00:55:45,690
isn't she Song Si Ho from the RG club?

764
00:55:45,690 --> 00:55:48,540
She says she's my roommate...

765
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:50,470
It'll be tiring for you.

766
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:53,840
What can I do?

767
00:55:57,770 --> 00:56:02,750
Excuse me, you said your name was Bok Joo, right? Could you close the window?

768
00:56:04,420 --> 00:56:08,970
I have a weak bronchus so I can't catch a cold. Sorry about that.

769
00:56:10,150 --> 00:56:13,710
I have a lot of body heat, so I leave it open though...

770
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:24,870
Excuse me. Also in your closet, could you make some space for me? There's no room.

771
00:56:24,870 --> 00:56:28,160
Yes. Ah, I used to just use it alone, so...

772
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:34,400
Here you go.

773
00:56:35,390 --> 00:56:42,620


774
00:56:56,470 --> 00:57:01,280
Hey, hey, hey, Joon Hyeong! Did you hear the news? The Dorm Pervert was caught.

775
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:06,130
It was the jerk man who works in the administration office and looks very fishy. Now, you cleared yourself.

776
00:57:06,130 --> 00:57:07,390
Why did that old man steal clothing?

777
00:57:07,390 --> 00:57:11,730
I don't know. But rather, here's even more shocking news:

778
00:57:11,730 --> 00:57:14,310
Song Si Ho came back from Taereung.

779
00:57:16,190 --> 00:57:20,680
Your ex-girlfriend came back because she failed at the first round of  the National Representative Audition.

780
00:57:24,780 --> 00:57:27,310
Why did she do that?

781
00:57:34,300 --> 00:57:36,470
Excuse me...

782
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:49,550
Excuse me?

783
00:57:51,020 --> 00:57:57,070
You know, the guy that's tall, has a really sharp face,

784
00:57:57,070 --> 00:58:00,830
and always rides a bike?

785
00:58:00,830 --> 00:58:02,330
Who is she talking about?

786
00:58:02,330 --> 00:58:03,670
I don't know.

787
00:58:03,670 --> 00:58:10,080
That person the students always call handsome or whatever, that...

788
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:12,070
Are you looking for me?

789
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:18,920
Tall, sharp faced, and always rides a bike.

790
00:58:20,030 --> 00:58:21,810
It's me, isn't it?

791
00:58:23,970 --> 00:58:27,850
Excuse me, this.

792
00:58:27,850 --> 00:58:34,170
I'm sorry for the  misunderstanding. As an apology, I even washed it so—

793
00:58:41,070 --> 00:58:45,190
Why did you wash this? Who told you to wash this however you wanted?!

794
00:58:45,730 --> 00:58:50,930
Hey! Is it a sin to wash a handkerchief?! I felt sorry, so

795
00:58:50,930 --> 00:58:55,120
I thought to myself that I should at least give this to you first. I'm even late for my practice, but I brought it anyway!

796
00:58:55,120 --> 00:59:00,290
Wow! You're picking a fight over nothing. You have no manners.

797
00:59:02,370 --> 00:59:05,440
- Give it back! I'll dirty it up again! Give it to me.
 - Let go.

798
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:06,750
I'll dirty it up again! Give it back!

799
00:59:06,750 --> 00:59:08,690
Let go!

800
00:59:18,250 --> 00:59:19,970
Hey!

801
00:59:21,390 --> 00:59:23,920
Hey!

802
00:59:28,080 --> 00:59:30,210
Hey!

803
00:59:52,300 --> 00:59:59,630
♬   How can I get your love?   ♬

804
00:59:59,630 --> 01:00:07,040
♬   How can I make you smile?   ♬

805
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:14,320
♬   This heart-throbbing excitement   ♬

806
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:21,860
♬   colors my feelings   ♬

807
01:00:21,860 --> 01:00:27,180
♬   you and I in my dream   ♬

808
01:00:27,180 --> 01:00:32,800
♬   I don't know where this feeling came from   ♬
