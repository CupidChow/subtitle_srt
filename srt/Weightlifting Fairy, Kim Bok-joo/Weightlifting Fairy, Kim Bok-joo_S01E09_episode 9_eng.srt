Bok Joo.

4
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm right, it's Bok Joo.

5
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:03,630
But how are you here?

6
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:08,980
Hey, Bok Joo! You should have called if you came!

7
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:15,230
So, Bok Joo said she wanted to look around my school before she leaves for studying abroad, so I told her to come.

00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:20,540
Hyung, that's why this...

10
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:22,460
To be honest...

11
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:24,140
 Don't say it. Don't say it. 

12
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,980
I'm a student at this school, in weightlifting.

13
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:34,140
I lied about being a cello major, and I also lied about studying abroad.

14
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:39,200
I'm sorry, Doctor.

15
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:58,300
I was also really at a loss when I first saw her at your clinic.

16
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:02,460
But what could I do? Bok Joo asked me to keep it a secret.

17
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:06,560
Still, you should've given me a hint at least. I didn't know it at all.

18
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,600
I couldn't do that because she was desperate.

19
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,450
- What is the reason?
 - What?

20
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:17,680
So what's the reason she went to the clinic if she was a weightlifter?

21
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:23,270
Well... I guess she wanted to lose weight.

22
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:30,300
It turns out she found a man that she likes, since she's a woman, too.

23
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:35,370
It could be like that.

24
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:39,970
Anyway, Bok Joo went through a lot of heartache this time around.

25
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:41,930
She was caught by her department.

26
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:44,090
Her professor and  coach flipped out,

27
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:47,830
and her dad was really infuriated. It was a total mess.

28
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:49,420
Really?

29
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:53,260
Ah, I feel so guilty now. What should I do?

30
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,640
Well, you didn't know anything, Hyung.

31
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,270
It's her fault for lying.

32
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:03,180
But still, I made the person who needs strength diet to lose weight.

33
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,250
It's fine. It's all over, anyway.

34
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:12,290
She lied about studying abroad because she knew she couldn't attend the clinic anymore.

35
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:15,900
Just don't mind her.

36
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:19,190
Who is the man she liked?

37
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,310
- Hyung.
 - Huh?

38
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:28,210
I'm hungry.

39
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:33,330
Why, of all places and times, was he there suddenly? Now, I'm completely ruined , aren't I?

40
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:36,320
Now I've become a complete liar to Doctor whenever I open my mouth, haven't I?

41
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:41,180
This isn't right. This is the worst. What should I do?

42
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:46,020
 In order to transform that one lie into a truth, 

43
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:49,590
 I needed seven lies. 

44
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:55,250
 While a lie makes another lie and that lie expects another lie, 

45
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:59,680
 I had become a vending machine of lies. 

46
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:04,730
 I'm so ashamed of myself.

Did she eat a mountain of ginseng by herself? Why does she act like that?

54
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:55,650
Who knows?

55
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:58,950
Did she possibly bump into that doctor even though we tried to prevent that happening with all of our mighty fighting spirit?

56
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:03,280
Impossible! Tae Gwon said Jeong Joon Hyeong had safely taken her out.

57
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,820
That's right.

58
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:08,250
Then, where the heck is all that super power coming from?

59
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:10,220
Is that the same girl who hurt her back lifting a barbell earlier?

60
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:12,070
Ah, that crazy woman.

61
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:18,710
She paused for a moment. Go stop her.

62
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:22,000
Would I be able to handle it even if I do go? She's completely lost her mind.

 - Stop!

65
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,180
You keep shaking your balance more and more as time goes on, Si Ho.

66
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:46,980
Your movements are delayed because you're only focusing on your turns.

67
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:50,520
This won't do. To be safe, let's cut it down to four turns.

68
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,610
No, I'll do it again.

69
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:56,750
Okay. Then try it first, and if it doesn't work, we'll modify it.

70
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:07,090
Daebak! Coach, did you see Soo Bin's point?

71
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:09,310
It was awesome.

72
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:12,930
Hey, you should practice your own routine. Why are you doing someone else's?

73
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:15,180
I just tried it out.

74
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:18,630
I wondered how hard it was.

75
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:33,770
Yes, Si Eon?

76
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:39,250
Dad really left? He even packed his bags?

77
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:42,580
Yeah, he's going somewhere in Ulsan.

78
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:44,710
He purposely got a job there.

79
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:47,690
Mom doesn't even look at him and goes to the mart,

80
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:50,630
and people who are interested in buying the house are constantly in and out.

81
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,510
Unni, what did you do?

82
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:57,810
I told you what was happening so that you could  do something about it.

83
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:00,890
So you should've stopped them, no matter the cost.

84
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:05,660
- I met with Mom. But—
 - So, just because you say so once,

85
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:09,190
"Sure. I won't get a divorce." Did you think she was going to say that?

86
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:13,120
You should've threatened her or cried while clinging on to her! You should've done everything you could!

87
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,260
Our house has turned out this way because of your oh-so-great rhythmic gymnastics!

88
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:21,040
Don't look for me.

89
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,390
Si Eon!

90
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:35,790
Ugh, that crazy woman. Who can stop her?

91
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:37,550
Well, leave her alone.

92
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:40,650
I guess she'll collapse today. She's human after all.

93
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,060
Why is she doing that? We should've waited until after we knew the reason.

94
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:46,890
I don't know either!

95
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:51,210
There must be something that doesn't match with her. I don't even  want  to know.

96
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:54,060
I'm so tired of her behaving like this.

97
00:07:57,150 --> 00:08:00,430
Looking at her. She doesn't have much left in her.

98
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:13,830
Aigoo, take this off.

99
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:21,780
Get up.

100
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:27,560
Aigoo.

101
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:30,890
I'll die at a young age because of you.

102
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:36,260
Hey, are you really not going to tell me?

103
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:39,680
There's something like that. That's all I'm telling you, so shut your mouth. Don't think about it.

104
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:44,120
Why can't your brother, who is completely gentlemanly, unlike you,

105
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,880
meet our Mercenary (Bok Joo)?

106
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:50,140
What is this? Feeling a hunch of something coming on this weekend?

107
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:55,420
Hey, I prepared a special event because we're getting a night out for the first time in a long time.

108
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:57,020
If you don't tell me, I'm not going to tell you either.

109
00:08:57,020 --> 00:09:00,550
Forget it. I'm not at all curious.

110
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:04,590
it's a 3-on-3 date with three of the most popular girls from Sukyoung Women's University's English department.

111
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:09,500
One of them is my friend on SNS. Her face and body are like a work of art. She is as photogenic as a celebrity.

112
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,290
How is it?

113
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:14,420
I don't believe you, punk.

114
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:17,560
You have nothing to lose. Let's just check it out.

115
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:21,930
This is a good opportunity for us.

116
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:26,720
Have a great day, Noonim.

117
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,380
Elsa, there is no other Elsa.

118
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:42,430
Woon Gi your grip is too loose.

119
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:44,300
Why are you hunching like this?

120
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:46,780
Bok Joo! Strength in your hand!

121
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:51,490
Yeah. More, more. Give more strength in your stomach!

122
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:54,630
More. More.

123
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:59,090
Use your midsection more. Why are you so out of focus.

124
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:01,690
- Sit down quickly!
 - Coach Choi.

125
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:06,020
Coach Choi, just send the kids home for the day. It's the final week before the competition.

126
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:10,520
Professor, their weight isn't at the perfect level yet. They also have to build muscle mass.

127
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,020
This is not the time to send them home.

128
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:17,030
That's why I'm saying they should go home and have some restoratives before they come back.

129
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:21,200
Yes, sir. I understand You guys eat with your will, not your taste buds.

130
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,230
Woon Gi, you need to gain another kilogram. And Bok Joo, you need 1.5 kilograms.

131
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:27,160
- Yes. 
 - Yes.

132
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:32,230
Go home and recuperate. Get encouragement from your family and eat lots of delicious food.

133
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:37,270
But if you don't gain weight be prepared to eat 10 plates a day. Understand?

134
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:38,890
Yes, I understand.

135
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:44,340
It's not easy to gain weight, is it?

136
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:48,420
No. Well, it's not like I'm the only one having a hard time.

137
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:52,750
If you're tired of just drinking protein, try adding eggs and bread to it.

138
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,820
I tried it because Sang Cheol told me about it,

139
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,350
and it was edible enough to eat.

140
00:10:57,350 --> 00:11:00,680
Yes. I'll try that. You're going home, aren't you Sunbae?

141
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:04,700
Yeah. Because someone's coming here.

142
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:08,030
- Yes.
 - Ah, so annoying! Seriously!

143
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,350
Where are you trying to run away to after you put my seat in this state?

144
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:15,810
I  just spilled a little bit of milk. Why do I have to pay for dry cleaning?

145
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:18,240
- Bok Joo, I'll head on first.
 - Yes.

146
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,940
Goodbye, Sunbae!

147
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:31,940
Since you're English majors, going abroad isn't a problem, right?

148
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:34,500
Aren't you able to talk freely and fluently in English, like native speakers?

149
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:40,140
It's not like that. It's not like you cross the Pacific Ocean just because you're swimmers.

150
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:44,650
Crossing the Pacific! Wow, your sense is amazing.

151
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:48,140
But it seems like this person is the silent type.

152
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:51,150
Yes, well. Compared to him.

153
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:54,060
What's your specialty? Possibly short-distance?

154
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:56,270
That's right. You can tell I'm short with my words as well just by looking at me.

155
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:57,890
Oh he does sprints.

156
00:11:57,890 --> 00:12:00,150
 Fatty 

157
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:02,330
One moment.

158
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:06,080
Oh, if it isn't the super busy Kim Bok Joo.

159
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:09,580
Thank you for finally calling me back after my three missed calls.

160
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:12,630
Where are you? Are you already home?

161
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:15,330
No, not yet. I came out for a bit.

162
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:21,570
The doctor was really surprised yesterday, wasn't he? What did he say?

163
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:26,190
You waited well, Kim Bok Joo. You must have been curious.

164
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:28,750
Where are you, school?

165
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:06,060
Ah, you scared me! Make some noise when you come! You scared me! Jeez, I was so shocked.

166
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:11,460
Hey, what are you doing right now? Why are you making holes on an innocent person's eyes, nose, and lips?

167
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:14,870
Nothing. I just got bored while I was waiting.

168
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:24,830
What did the doctor say?

169
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:29,750
You're asking really early. Hey, how did you hold back when you were so curious?

170
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:31,880
He must have thought I was crazy.

171
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:35,080
Probably thought I was a crazy dork.

172
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:40,160
It wasn't that bad. He was just a bit taken aback, that's all.

173
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:46,090
Hey, is there any way he wouldn't be? The patient that he's taking care of tells him she's a weightlifter.

174
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:51,860
He asked me why you were going around lying, but I just gave him a rough rundown of it.

175
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:54,020
I told him that it seemed like you found a man that you like.

176
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:55,730
You didn't possibly tell him who it is, right?

177
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:59,390
I also have common sense. Why would I tell him that?

178
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,990
He thinks I'm really pathetic, doesn't he?

179
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:05,860
Rather than thinking you're pathetic,

180
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:09,720
I think he was just kind of puzzled.

181
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:14,010
If it wasn't for the cello, I wouldn't have become a crazy liar.

182
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:17,000
Why did the cello have to pop out at me right then?

183
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,280
I even went to the concert and put on a total show.

184
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:24,340
Hey, are you resenting me now after you liked me so much for getting you a date with him back then?

185
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:26,550
You shouldn't do that, as a human!

186
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:29,300
What are you talking about? I'm just saying.

187
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,820
Jeez.

188
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:41,860
What's wrong with this girl? It's not like you're a lunatic!

189
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:45,390
Why do I not have any luck?

190
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:50,330
Regardless of weightlifting or whatever, I wish I could disappear from this earth, like smoke.

191
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:54,050
It's impossible for you to disappear like smoke.

192
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:58,130
There's your own basic weight. Sorry.

193
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:03,470
I guess it's a habit for me to crack jokes. I'll be careful from now on.

194
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:09,100
Do you want to go relieve stress?

195
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:13,090
Hey, hurry! You're dying, you're dying!

196
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:19,760
- Let's stop.
 - Look at that. Am I almost dying?

197
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,640
Bok Joo, look well.

198
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:25,690
I'll show you a new record.

199
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:32,660
What do you think? This record hasn't been broken for almost three years.

200
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:37,860
Even a male weightlifter can't beat this record. Ah,  I just made a new record.

201
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:55,200
No, I'm not looking! I'm not!

202
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,950
Hey, hey, hey! Be gentle! It looks like your fingers are going to fall off.

203
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:01,780
Ah, seriously! This isn't moving. I guess it got stuck.

204
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:04,200
Ah, that's why I told you to be gentle with it!

205
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:07,450
- Why isn't this working? Why isn't it working?
 - Hey, stop.

206
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:09,560
Hey, get up.

207
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,510
- Why?
 - Shhh.

208
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:13,180
Get up. Hurry.

209
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:15,780
What?

210
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:17,340
- Excuse me!
 - Hey, run!

211
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:19,090
Run!

212
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:27,580
Ah, I really hate running. Why do I run so much when I'm with you?

213
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:30,350
I should become a track runner at this rate.

214
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:34,300
How can an athlete not be able to control her emotions?

215
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:37,810
Shut up. I still have so much stress to relieve.

216
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:42,740
Hey! isn't there a place to go boxing here? Do you know how to box?

217
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:46,520
Bok Joo, do you want alcohol instead?

218
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:52,220
Alcohol? If I drink today,  I think I'll drink too much.

219
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:26,950
Yeah.

220
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:29,710
Si Eon didn't come home yesterday.

221
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:32,850
 I think that she packed some of her things and left. 

222
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,640
Where are we going to sleep tonight?

223
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,990
I don't know.

224
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:42,210
- We don't have any?
 - Nope, we don't.

225
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:45,080
What the heck? Are we all out?

226
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,850
- Who the heck is she?
 - What the heck?

227
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:48,530
- What the heck?
 - So annoying.

228
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:51,200
Hey, hey. Forget it. It's fine.

229
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,820
 Don't tell Si Eon that I told you. 

230
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:56,670
 One of her friends ran away from her family.   

231
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:59,710
 She said that she would stay there for a while. 

232
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:02,740
I told you to let me go!

233
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:06,390
Ah, why are you doing this, seriously? This is my life. What's it got to do with you?

234
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:09,260
If it's your life, then should I just stand by and watch you ruin it?

235
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:13,350
Since when did you have such an interest in me? Just do as you always did!

236
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:15,550
Let's go first and then talk.

237
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:18,610
Taxi! Get in.

238
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:23,080
I said hurry up and get in. Hey!

239
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,190
Ahjusshi, please hurry up and go. I don't know her.

240
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:28,300
Hey! Hey, Song Si Eon!

241
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:38,290
Wow, look at the way she's drinking.

242
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:40,170
This is like an old man. Are you really a young woman?

243
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:45,430
Shut up. Do you think I care how I look right now?

244
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:48,830
Hey hey, I'll pour you some.

245
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:53,540
That's right. That's what it means to be a friend.

246
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:56,140
When you want to cry, they let you cry,

247
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:59,680
and when you want to get drunk, they let you get drunk.

248
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:03,290
Ah, but why is this alcohol so tasteless today?

249
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:05,600
I won't get drunk at this rate.

250
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:12,260
Hey, hey. That is not it. Not it. Not it.

251
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:18,340
- Eat this.
- Aigoo.

252
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:22,670
Auntie! Please give us another of these. Auntie!

253
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:34,510


254
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:42,460
Song Si Ho?

255
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,880
What are you doing alone at this time?

256
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,880
I just went somewhere.

257
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:52,350
I just got done with practice. I'm planning on playing some billiard games with some friends for a little while.

258
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:56,140
Would It be alright if I joined in too?

259
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:58,650
I'll just watch.

260
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:11,780
Ah, I'm going to go crazy. Why am I not getting drunk at all even though I'm drinking so much?

261
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:15,190
I don't know. From what I can see, you're pretty drunk.

262
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:19,180
No, I'm not. I'm fine.

263
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:23,560
Look at this! I drink to get drunk, and I don't get drunk.

264
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:27,710
I was going to focus on weightlifting then got distracted by something so random.

265
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:31,580
The man that I like doesn't like me.

266
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:35,370
The men that I don't like don't like me either.

267
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:38,570
That's right. Life isn't easy.

268
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:46,780
Hey, Jeong Joon Hyeong. Do you know where everything started to go wrong?

269
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:48,400
Vanity table.

270
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,750
Vanity table?

271
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:52,090
The one that my dad picked up from the street.

272
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:57,480
If it wasn't for the vanity, I wouldn't have gone that way that day.

273
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:00,710
If I hadn't gone that way, I wouldn't have met Doctor.

274
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:04,220
No, no. That's not it. You!

275
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:05,120
Me?

276
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:09,610
If you weren't the doctor's brother, then things wouldn't have gotten this twisted. You take responsibility!

277
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:14,710
Hey, why does the arrow come to me? Who told you to like my brother?

278
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:16,940
That's true.

279
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:22,130
You didn't make me. It's all my fault.

280
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:28,890
But Joon Hyeong, do you know what the real starting point of this fate is?

281
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:32,690
Is it fate this time? What is it?

282
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:34,910
Vanity.

283
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:38,550
The vanity that my dad picked up.

284
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:43,110
If it weren't for the vanity, I wouldn't have gone that way that day.

285
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:47,250
If I hadn't gone that way, I wouldn't have met the doctor.

286
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:50,400
So, you take responsibility!

287
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,920
You're drunk. Let's go.

288
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:55,850
I told you, I'm not drunk.

289
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:03,410
But... Do you know where things started to go wrong?

290
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:07,150
Yes. It's either from the vanity or me.

291
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:10,120
Oh! How did you know?

292
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,570
You rascal. You're pretty smart.

293
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:16,330
Hey, what's your IQ? Is your IQ over 100?

294
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:19,100
Hey, hey, hey! Hey!

295
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:34,010
Why did she go from sober to completely drunk? I wasn't even emotionally prepared for this.

296
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:35,870
Ah, this is so hard!

297
00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:39,450
Take responsibility, Jeong Joon Hyeong!

298
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:42,620
Take responsibility!

299
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:45,590
Hey, how am I supposed to take responsibility more than this?

300
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:50,750
- Take responsibility! Take responsibility!
 - Hey, wait!

301
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:53,310
Hey, you can't throw up. Don't throw up. Don't throw up!

302
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:54,950
Hold it in. Hold it in!

303
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:03,150
Ah, it's cold.

304
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:05,970
Are you cold?

305
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:16,500
There are newspapers here.

306
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:19,450
This is perfect.

307
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:24,320
Bok Joo, newspapers.

308
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,370
Why are you sleeping with your eyes open? Aigoo.

309
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:29,810
Alright. Put your hand on it like this

310
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:32,520
and this hand too.

311
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:40,680
Aha! You will feel the greatness of one sheet of newspaper.

312
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:48,640
Oh, oh!

313
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,200
Hey! Wait.

314
00:23:56,370 --> 00:23:58,520
Take responsibility.

315
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:02,810
I took more than enough responsibility.

316
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:09,360
She's totally in dreamland.

317
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,770
How could you look like this?

318
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:26,320


319
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:45,420
It's cold!

320
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:49,750
Hey, Bok Joo. Let's go, Bok Joo.

321
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:51,910
Hey, wake up.

322
00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:54,750
Ah, how am I supposed to carry this thing?

323
00:24:57,810 --> 00:25:00,040
 Plus Mart   

324
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:15,450
My mom would feel so proud if she saw this.

325
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:18,760
Hey, Ahjusshi. Where are we going?

326
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:22,050
Wake up, Kim Bok Joo!

327
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:25,010
Yes, this is Bok Chicken.

328
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:28,880
Oh, yes, a half-and-half. Father, a half-and-half!

329
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:31,640
Ah! Ah, when will we get to your house?

330
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:36,140
I told you to take responsibility, Jeong Joon Hyeong!

331
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,750
Responsibility, my foot!

332
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:41,210
Hey, you're awake right now, aren't you?

333
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:44,220
I'm nauseous. Please go slowly.

334
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:47,730
Hey, Bok Joo! Hey, you rascal!

335
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:53,270
Be careful. Careful. Gently, gently.

336
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:56,970
Gently, gently. Go slowly, slowly.

337
00:25:56,970 --> 00:26:01,080
You bastard! I told you to be gentle! Hey, take out a thick blanket. Thick blanket!

338
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:03,300
She's cold. She's freezing!

339
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:06,660
You little bastard.

340
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:14,910
It's seriously disgusting how much you love your daughter while cursing at her. So disgusting.

341
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:18,500
Just how much did she drink to be knocked out like this?

342
00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:25,330
Did she drink alone with just that weasel guy?

343
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:27,210
Until this late at night?

344
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:29,710
What are you trying to imply, you bastard? Why I ought to just—!

345
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:34,670
I told you to take responsibility, Jeong Joon Hyeong!

346
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,240
For what?

347
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:41,040
This bastard!

348
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:43,420
This little—!

349
00:26:56,150 --> 00:27:01,990
So, there's nothing like  that  for you to take responsibility for, right?

350
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,900
- Of course not. 
 - Do you swear it?

351
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:07,050
I'm just her friend! I'm her classmate from elementary school.

352
00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:10,280
We know all about that, but in relationships between men and women,

353
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:13,430
a friend becomes your darling, and an oppa becomes a dad.

354
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:18,540
It's not like that. We're just friends. It's seriously not like that at all!

355
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:20,280
It's not like that at all, seriously!

356
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:22,550
- Not at all?
 - Yes, not at all!

357
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:25,430
Why is it not at all?! What's wrong with our Bok Joo?!

358
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:28,020
She only does sports and doesn't dress up or put makeup on her face.

359
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:32,920
If you look at her closely, she's so incredibly beautiful!

360
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,600
What?

361
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:38,080
Hyung. One second. Wait a second.

362
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:41,250
You seem kind of like a psycho right now.

363
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:44,720
Let's stick with one point instead of going back and forth.

364
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,100
Really? Alright.

365
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:54,420
Well, anyway. Bok Joo is Bok Joo, but it's the same for you as well.

366
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:56,990
An athlete that uses his body stays out this late,

367
00:27:56,990 --> 00:28:02,300
goes around playing like this, and gives his friend that much alcohol. How would you become the best when you're acting like this?

368
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:04,210
Do you not have a dream?

369
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:05,900
I'm sorry.

370
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:08,250
So you know you should be sorry?

371
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:09,650
Yes.

372
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:18,710
May I... go home?

373
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:27,470
Understand him. Even though it doesn't look like it, my hyung's obsession over our Bok Joo is a bit excessive.

374
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:32,730
She's his only daughter. He must have felt so bad after her mother died early.

375
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,060
Yes.

376
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:38,060
I'll head home.

377
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:41,510
Okay, go. Oh, wait a second. Wait.

378
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:47,710
Here. Take a taxi there. You must have run completely out of strength because of Bok Joo.

379
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:49,970
No, I can just ride the bus there.

380
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:52,720
Your elder is giving it to you. Seriously.

381
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:59,700
- Actually, I  approve. 
 - What?

382
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:02,370
I'm telling you that I approve of  your dating Bok Joo.

383
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:07,330
Let's have a drink together the next time we meet, Nephew-in-law.

384
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:09,590
Ah, no. It's not like that.

385
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:12,670
I'll head home.

386
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:24,380
Let's go.

387
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:26,440
Hey, Jeong Joon Hyeong.

388
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,380
Oh, Hyung.

389
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:29,180
Where are you going?

390
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:30,750
Huh? I came out to go to the supermarket.

391
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:32,620
You're lying.

392
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:34,760
Hyung. Mom got really mad, didn't she?

393
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:38,070
She doesn't know. I told her you were sleeping because it looked like you'd be coming at dawn.

394
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:41,120
Ah, thank God. I was wondering how I would put up with Mom's nagging again.

395
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,550
What were you doing that you're just now getting in? Did you drink alcohol?

396
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:45,910
No, I didn't really drink.

397
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:49,460
But Bok Joo doesn't even know her limits and drank too much and passed out, even though she's not good at drinking.

398
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:51,750
I took her home before I came here.

399
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:54,990
- Just you and Bok Joo?
 - Yeah.

400
00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:58,400
Hyung, go. I'm going to sneak in without Mom knowing and get some shut eye.

401
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,640
Oh, alright. Go on in.

402
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:18,000
I'm really doing all sorts of things these days. I'm even having to make hangover soup for my daughter.

403
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:23,880
We've got plenty of alcohol here at home. Why would you go somewhere else and go around gulping down alcohol? And with some guy at that.

404
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:27,390
Sorry, Father. I won't do it again.

405
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:30,920
Eat it slowly. I'm warming you up some boiled meat.

406
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:33,860
What's with the boiled meat this early in the morning?

407
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:37,600
Oh, of course. It's the best to have the boiled meat in the morning in order to gain weight..

408
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:48,230
Our Bok Joo.

409
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,370
I....

410
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:55,300
I like that friend as a nephew-in-law.

411
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:56,200
What?

412
00:30:56,200 --> 00:31:01,100
I think we need a flower-boy like him to improve the genes in our family.

413
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:03,780
Forget it. I can't be with him.

414
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:06,310
I've shown him everything he should see and shouldn't see. How would we?

415
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:11,900
Things he should see and things he shouldn't see?

416
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:20,940
Uncle, what are you thinking right now?! It is not like that.

417
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:24,310
No, I understand everything.

418
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:29,840
It's not like we're in the Joseon era. It's possible for young men and women to do such a thing after they drink together.

419
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:33,370
You're two energetic youths.

420
00:31:33,370 --> 00:31:36,750
Uncle is not a person that's not understanding.

421
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:38,290
Admit it coolly.

422
00:31:38,290 --> 00:31:41,820
It's really not like that! I told you, we only drank alcohol! I'm serious.

423
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:47,600
You may be saying this because you're embarrassed. I understand. Uncle will coolly reveal mine first.

424
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,800
That... the Uncle's first experience—

425
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:54,000
Ah, ah. Father! Father, Dad!

426
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,780
- He's a pervert
 - What's wrong with you?

427
00:31:55,780 --> 00:32:00,380
What the heck are you saying to a child?  Eat up.

428
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:03,280
Here you go.

429
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,950
Joon Hyeong what time did you get back?

430
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:06,430
Right after you went to sleep.

431
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:11,790
Aigoo, how much alcohol did you drink down? The smell is practically reeking even from your outer clothes.

432
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,600
Don't you know I grew up in this neighborhood?

433
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:16,600
Do you want rumors going around about the son from the pharmacy staying out all night?

434
00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:19,070
Ah, Mother. I'm sorry, Mother.

435
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:20,680
I'm sorry, Mother. I'm sorry.

436
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:23,440
Aigoo, seriously. Look at you, so mischievous.

437
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,240
What time do you have to be at school?

438
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,210
Right after I eat. Why?

439
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:32,320
It's nothing special but your dad keeps saying he feels weak these days, so I wanted to go to the market to buy some milk vetch root (Hwang Gi).

440
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:35,510
In times like these if I had a daughter it would be perfect.

441
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:37,730
Jae Yi, how about you, do you have an appointment?

442
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:40,910
Yeah. Ah Yeong said she was going to buy some audio equipment, so I was going to take her.

443
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:42,910
- I'll go with you next time.
 - Ah Yeong?

444
00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:46,810
Oh yeah. You have to go and help her with that. I can go by myself.

445
00:32:46,810 --> 00:32:50,460
Go. Go and help her. I do not need anything else.

446
00:32:51,450 --> 00:32:52,670
Take your medicine.

447
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:54,340
Yes, Mother.

448
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:02,840
Hey, Woon Gi.

449
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,730
Hello.

450
00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:07,610
I heard you hit a taxi driver. Why did you do that?

451
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:24,730
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

452
00:33:24,730 --> 00:33:26,690
I'm sorry, Coach.

453
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:32,280
After a lot of thought, I registered our marriage and had a baby, but...

454
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:35,350
I couldn't bring myself to say it.

455
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:40,490
Alright. If it were me, I wouldn't be able to say it either.

456
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:43,350
Hey, you brat. You're a father now

457
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:46,140
Why did you hit someone? What exactly were you thinking.

458
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:49,820
He swore at my wife.

459
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:51,190
I couldn't hold myself back.

460
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:53,280
Ah, really...

461
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:58,290
It looks like that side is holding out thinking he can make some money.

462
00:33:58,290 --> 00:33:59,980
For now,

463
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:01,920
let's make a settlement with what I made.

464
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:04,350
No, Coach. I'll take care of that somehow.

465
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:07,380
How are you going to make three million won? Do you have money?

466
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:11,390
I heard your wife is working as a part-timer without a postpartum recovery because you barely make a living.

467
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:18,420
By whatever means, I will be sure to repay that money, Coach.

468
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:20,870
Did I say that you wouldn't pay it back?

469
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:26,120
- Have you named the baby?
 - It's Soon Ri.

470
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:28,350
So that she could go with the flow (Soon Ri) and live comfortably.

471
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:30,710
Hey, that's pretty good.

472
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:32,720
Soon Ri's Dad,

473
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:38,220
if you make any more secrets from now on, you're seriously dead.

474
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,910
Oh, Unni?

475
00:34:43,910 --> 00:34:49,220
Can you pay back that money that I lent you this month?

476
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:51,230
If you're going to leave it in the infirmary to use,

477
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:55,700
I think it'll be better to get one with bluetooth rather than one with regular audio. It's more convenient to use, too.

478
00:34:55,700 --> 00:35:00,960
Really? But there are so many kinds that I don't know which one I should pick.

479
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:04,920
From what I can see, I think that this one will be good.

480
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:08,590
Really? Then I should follow what the professional says.

481
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:10,450
- Please give me this model.
  - Yes, ma'am. 

482
00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:13,440
Please have a seat and wait a short while.

483
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,350
There's so much stuff.

484
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:25,130
Since I bought it at your recommendation, you've got to install it too.

485
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:28,080
Wow, now I understand why people get scammed with their eyes wide open.

486
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:30,410
Hey, I'll buy you some expensive food in exchange.

487
00:35:30,410 --> 00:35:32,510
Ah, right.

488
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:36,580
Do you know the student named Kim Bok Joo in your school's weightlifting department?

489
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:38,480
Bok Joo?

490
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,980
Weightlifting ace, tall friend.

491
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:45,160
You remember when I told you about that patient that asked me about Messi a while back?

492
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:47,220
Yeah. I remember. You said she was impressive.

493
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:50,340
That friend is that friend.

494
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:52,950
Huh? Hey, no way.

495
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:55,050
Why would a weightlifter go to a weight loss clinic?

496
00:35:55,050 --> 00:35:57,210
She told me that she plays the cello.

497
00:35:57,210 --> 00:36:00,510
But I ran into her at your school and found out that she's a weightlifter there.

498
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:02,130
Omo, she is quirky.

499
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:06,190
According to Joon Hyeong, she did that because she found a man that she likes.

500
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:09,490
That friend is Joon Hyeong's elementary classmate.

501
00:36:09,490 --> 00:36:13,270
Is that so? It's a small world.

502
00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:16,040
But who is the man that she likes?

503
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:20,620
She's been so busy with training that she hasn't really been seeing anyone much.

504
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:22,900
Is it possible that Joon Hyeong is the one she likes?

505
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:25,310
Joon Hyeong is popular and well-liked at school.

506
00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:28,210
He's quite popular among freshman girls.

507
00:36:28,210 --> 00:36:30,380
Is that so?

508
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:33,900
Of course. Those two do look really close.

509
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,330
They even drank together until the early morning yesterday.

510
00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:39,180
Ah, really? Then that's possible.

511
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:43,940
Why is my heart getting all fluttery for no reason? I hope that things go well for them.

512
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:49,590
- You worked hard, Mr. Engineer.
  - Yeah.

513
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:55,930
I took a lot of your time, so I'll treat you to whatever menu you want. Just say the word.

514
00:36:55,930 --> 00:36:57,910
Spaghetti? Pasta?

515
00:36:57,910 --> 00:37:00,800
I'm a highly paid person. What should I  eat to make it even?

516
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,330
Hey, just say the word.

517
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:07,150
Bok Joo!

518
00:37:09,290 --> 00:37:11,080
Hello, Doctor.

519
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:14,630
Kim Bok Joo! I heard about you just a while ago.

520
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:18,990
You pulled off a big scam. You fooled Doctor completely.

521
00:37:19,490 --> 00:37:21,990
Then, I'll get going.

522
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:26,810
You've still got some time. Let's go eat together. Call Joon Hyeong to come too.

523
00:37:26,810 --> 00:37:28,940
Ah, n-no. I'm not really hungry.

524
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:32,940
That's right, let's go together. I wanted to buy you a meal once anyway.

525
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:35,500
Let's go!

526
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:36,660
Let's go.

527
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:38,380
Get in.

528
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,560
- Steak.
- Steak? Let's eat steak.

529
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,580
You really like meat, don't you?

530
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:49,540
- And also...
 - Soup?

531
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:51,390
- Something for Bok Joo...
 - Okay.

532
00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:54,550
- Let's get her a salad. Ah.
 - A salad.

533
00:37:54,550 --> 00:37:57,480
You can have a hamburger, right?

534
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:59,930
A hamburger.

535
00:38:00,690 --> 00:38:02,640
Pasta.

536
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:06,070
- Oh, Hyung! Doc!
 - Yeah, Joon Hyeong!

537
00:38:12,610 --> 00:38:14,460
What kind of combination is this meeting?

538
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:19,040
He set up my audio system for me and then we ran into Bok Joo on our way to go get something to eat.

539
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:22,160
I heard that you two were classmates in elementary school. I didn't know that.

540
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:25,710
Ah, well. It's not something that we bragged about all over the place.

541
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:30,670
Oh, yeah. That young lady who talked about Messi was also none other than her, Bok Joo.

542
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:33,450
I was really surprised!

543
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:38,880
I didn't even know that.

544
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:45,710
There's more than enough. Eat up, you guys.

545
00:38:46,790 --> 00:38:49,210
You worked really hard today, so you eat a lot too, Mr. Engineer.

546
00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:51,620
Yes, I'll eat well.

547
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:53,690
Thank you.

548
00:38:53,690 --> 00:38:58,750
But I'm the type that can't hold back when I'm curious about something. So can I ask you one question?

549
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:02,370
Is the man that you said that you like a student at our school?

550
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:06,350
Oh, that's...

551
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:08,820
- Um, that...
 - Stop it.

552
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:12,010
Stop it. That's a violation of privacy.

553
00:39:12,010 --> 00:39:16,060
Right? That's true. I did overdo it a little. Sorry.

554
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:19,900
But how long have you been close to Joon Hyeong?

555
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:23,460
It's been over a year since I came to this school, but I never noticed.

556
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:25,340
We just found out recently ourselves.

557
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:27,360
He changed a lot.

558
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:31,070
Ah, really? It must have been fascinating.

559
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:34,980
Your friend from when you were little kids grew to be so tall and his shoulders got so broad.

560
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:37,330
My heart would have totally raced, too.

561
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:41,690
Now that I look at it, you two look really good together.

562
00:39:41,690 --> 00:39:44,850
Maybe it's because they're tall? Right?

563
00:39:44,850 --> 00:39:46,260
Yeah, well.

564
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:48,960
Ah, Doc! You're really overdoing it today.

565
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,560
- Do you know that your lines are really unnatural?
 - Hey!

566
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:54,590
It's not like that. I'm saying it because you two really do suit each other.

567
00:39:54,590 --> 00:39:58,380
Hey, forget it. Stop pestering her and eat. It'll all get cold.

568
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:00,080
- Hurry up and eat.
 - Alright.

569
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:02,880
You're telling me to shut up and just eat, right? I accept it.

570
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:06,740
- Why are you being like that? Hey, take this.
 - What?

571
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:09,190
Marinated ribs.

572
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:10,870
It's delicious. So good.

573
00:40:10,870 --> 00:40:12,730
Here.

574
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:15,590
Bok Joo, you have one too.

575
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:19,470
Have one of these.

576
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:23,290
Here, Here.

577
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:25,070
Eat a lot.

578
00:40:25,070 --> 00:40:29,410
How can I eat all this? Look at that meat.

579
00:40:29,410 --> 00:40:31,220
Let's eat this together.

580
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:35,710
- Eat this one, too.
 - Here, you really like this.

581
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:42,220
Thank you for the meal.

582
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:45,080
We enjoyed the meal.

583
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:48,490
You went through a lot of trouble because of me today, so I'll give you a ride home.

584
00:40:48,490 --> 00:40:51,650
Should I give you guys a ride, too? I can just drop you off.

585
00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:53,760
Ah, no. We can just walk.

586
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:59,070
Okay then. The sight of you walking together will make a pretty picture. Do well.

587
00:40:59,070 --> 00:41:01,660
Go safely. See you again, Bok Joo.

588
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:13,640
No matter how I think, Doc Ah Yeong barks up the wrong tree, right?

589
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:17,030
What's important about that?

590
00:41:17,030 --> 00:41:19,140
I don't need any of it.

591
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:37,050
Now that I think about it Joon Hyeong,

592
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:40,350
it's better that it happened that way.

593
00:41:40,350 --> 00:41:42,170
What?

594
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:44,140
That place where we were today.

595
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:47,790
Something felt off because we separated like that,

596
00:41:47,790 --> 00:41:51,660
but it feels like I somehow ended things well.

597
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:55,800
I feel like all I need to do is focus on the matches that I have left.

598
00:41:55,800 --> 00:42:00,810
But why are you so listless? Would you be able to prepare for the rest of your matches like this way?

599
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:02,550
I know, right?

600
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:07,080
Why am I so listless and devoid of energy?

601
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:09,600
I don't really know.

602
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:16,380
But the doctor and our school doctor look good together.

603
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:17,800
They look comfortable with each other, too.

604
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:21,000
It's because they're medical college mates. Also, there were times they spent together during all that studying.

605
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,630
They're on the same level, too. The school doctor is pretty.

606
00:42:24,630 --> 00:42:27,010
Her personality is good, and she's a doctor too.

607
00:42:27,010 --> 00:42:31,980
Hey, you look pretty alright too. Your body is strong and solid, too.

608
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:35,860
Do you call that consoling? Jerk.

609
00:42:38,010 --> 00:42:39,470
Do you want to eat something?

610
00:42:39,470 --> 00:42:43,660
We just ate. My stomach has a limit, too.

611
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:47,070
Then do you want to watch a movie?

612
00:42:47,070 --> 00:42:49,200
Or club?

613
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:53,400
Hey, the beach! How about the beach? A drive?

614
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:56,150
Can you drive? What about the car?

615
00:42:56,150 --> 00:43:00,960
There is my car that's not mine. I think we could make it back really quickly if we're just going to the beach.

616
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:06,200
No. When would we make it back from something like that? Forget it.

617
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:09,890
Why? Let's go. Let's go the beach.

618
00:43:09,890 --> 00:43:11,570
You lose if you don't play, rock paper scissors!

619
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:15,700
Let's go.

620
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:19,740
- Are you sure you can drive?
 - I can do it

621
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:32,560
Hey, your bod is totally rad. You want a ride?

622
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:43,580
- Hey, is this okay? This is the— 
 - Doctor's Car, but it's also my car.

623
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:45,920
I've been stealthily driving without him knowing for a few years.

624
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:50,160
I have the emergency key too. Hyung probably knows that I drive but acts like he doesn't.

625
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,990
Are you sure you're good at driving?

626
00:43:51,990 --> 00:43:54,210
Of course, I'm the best driver.

627
00:43:54,210 --> 00:43:58,520
First... Where is it? Put your seat belt on.

628
00:44:00,490 --> 00:44:02,490
I don't know if this is a good thing.

629
00:44:02,490 --> 00:44:04,180
Okay!

630
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:06,500
You know we're a bit short of making it on time before the night attendance, right?

631
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:10,310
Grab the handle. Oppa has no reverse.

632
00:44:20,410 --> 00:44:26,610
♬    I'll take you so that you won't regret it  ♬

633
00:44:26,610 --> 00:44:29,680
Hey, what do you think? Oppa's a pretty good driver, isn't he?

634
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:33,600
Yes. It shows so much that you're a novice driver and you make me feel like throwing up. It's really good for keeping me from thinking about other things.

635
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:36,420
Hey, this is all a concept.

636
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:40,020
It's hard to pretend to be bad when you are good at it.

637
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:42,480
Either way, I'm happy now that we've come out here.

638
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:45,710
Look at that. It's a good thing you listened to your Oppa, isn't it?

639
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:49,020
Hey, do you regret it?

640
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:51,640
Hiding the fact that you are a weightlifter from my brother?

641
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:55,750
No.

642
00:44:56,610 --> 00:45:02,180
Even if I go back to that time, I still don't think that I would have been able to be honest.

643
00:45:02,180 --> 00:45:04,520
Why? You take pride in being a weightlifter.

644
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:06,820
What's wrong with a woman that lifts weights?

645
00:45:06,820 --> 00:45:11,020
Of course, I take pride in it. I have a great sense of pride.

646
00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:13,790
But that's as a weightlifter.

647
00:45:13,790 --> 00:45:17,820
Women who do weightlifting  are  cool.

648
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:20,290
But to be honest, they're not pretty.

649
00:45:21,020 --> 00:45:23,400
What's the difference between the two?

650
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:25,790
There is a difference.

651
00:45:25,790 --> 00:45:30,950
Even my sunbaes who have boyfriends don't really let their boyfriends come to their competitions.

652
00:45:30,950 --> 00:45:35,680
We lift really heavy barbells. Because of that,

653
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:39,890
we can't help what happens at that moment. Our veins pop out, and our faces get really red.

654
00:45:39,890 --> 00:45:45,630
We get double and triple chins and our belly fat bulges out from our belts. It's no joke.

655
00:45:45,630 --> 00:45:48,480
No matter how much people say looks aren't everything,

656
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:52,270
and it's cool to get yourself absorbed in what you're doing for your dream,

657
00:45:52,270 --> 00:45:57,090
I don't think that it's an image of yourself that you'd want to show in front of the man that you like.

658
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:04,390
That's why, when I think about it a certain way,

659
00:46:04,390 --> 00:46:08,410
I wonder, "If I'm going to live as a weightlifter,

660
00:46:08,410 --> 00:46:12,420
then won't I have to give up being a woman to some extent?" That's what I think.

661
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:15,060
Jeez. That's ridiculous!

662
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:19,680
All you have to do is meet a man that thinks that you're so loveable that he could die, even when you look like that.

663
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:22,760
That's easy to say. Do you think it's easy to meet a man like that?

664
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:25,030
Hey, why wouldn't there be? Even if it's just me—

665
00:46:25,030 --> 00:46:29,490
Wow! Hey, look at those seagulls! Those seagulls, look! They'are a flock of them! Did you see it?

666
00:46:29,490 --> 00:46:31,950
- Over there, over there!
 - I have to look straight ahead.

667
00:46:31,950 --> 00:46:36,460
Do you want to ride t-that, what do you call it? Something... You can give seagulls food on the boat...?

668
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:38,770
I need to drive. I can't look at that.

669
00:46:38,770 --> 00:46:41,530
Ah, why do you act like this? You really look like a novice, seriously.

670
00:46:41,530 --> 00:46:43,360
Hey, seagull or me?  Choose one, just here!

671
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:44,980
Seagull.

672
00:46:44,980 --> 00:46:47,420
Seagull or me? Last time I'm asking. Seagull or me?

673
00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:50,890
Hey, do you want to eat some seagull?

674
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:54,800
♬   Will you be spinning in delight?  ♬

675
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:59,900
It's the ocean, ocean.
 ♬   I think you're so pretty.  ♬

676
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:02,820
Woo! Hello, seagulls!

677
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:05,420
Hey, is this your first time coming to the ocean? How corny.

678
00:47:05,420 --> 00:47:09,430
It's because my stuffy heart opens perkily.

679
00:47:09,430 --> 00:47:11,770
You would usually come to the ocean with your boyfriend

680
00:47:11,770 --> 00:47:15,360
and play catch them. Then later you'd write your names in the sand.

681
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:19,860
How old are you that you'd do something like that? Aigoo, you really don't act your age.

682
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:22,550
Act your age. Act your age, okay? Hey.

683
00:47:23,820 --> 00:47:27,430
- Hey, hey! Hey! HEY!!!
- Try and catch me!

684
00:47:27,430 --> 00:47:31,290
♬   Following the rain and a rainbow   ♬

685
00:47:31,290 --> 00:47:34,340
♬   in our personal heaven we are   ♬

686
00:47:34,340 --> 00:47:37,290
♬   starting to search for a wonderful day.  ♬

687
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:44,200
♬   From now on when it's hard if we give  up by turning around  ♬

688
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:49,600
♬   we will reconsider. Tomorrow we will run two steps forward.  ♬

689
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:56,660
Oh, my head. My head. Hey.

690
00:47:58,490 --> 00:48:04,120
Aigoo, is it because our Fatty is heavy? Even her head is heavy.

691
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:06,880
- What?
 - I really felt as if my life was in danger.

692
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:09,330
How can you attack me with all your strength when I try to make you laugh?

693
00:48:09,330 --> 00:48:11,900
I've always been the incarnation of victory.

694
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:13,650
You're also pretty good at running, Jeong Joon Hyeong.

695
00:48:13,650 --> 00:48:16,530
Hey, I ran away in order to survive. So I could live.

696
00:48:16,530 --> 00:48:17,950
Hey.

697
00:48:20,350 --> 00:48:24,160
Ah, but I really have shown you everything there is to see about me.

698
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:25,920
How did things turn out this way?

699
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:28,860
So? Do you feel wronged or something?

700
00:48:28,860 --> 00:48:30,720
Of course I feel wronged.

701
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:33,660
Hey, I revealed everything about me to you and all I know about you is your start trauma?

702
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:35,830
That's the only thing I know about you.

703
00:48:35,830 --> 00:48:39,390
Okay, then I will reveal one too.

704
00:48:42,650 --> 00:48:45,410
A long time ago, when we were in elementary school...

705
00:48:54,830 --> 00:48:56,560
  Right, then nine! 

706
00:48:59,050 --> 00:49:02,130
 - Hey, whose chocolate is this?
 - I don't know! 

707
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:05,550
 - If there's no owner, then I'm going to eat it.
 - Okay. 

708
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:09,160
 - I'm really going to eat it!
 - Okay! 

709
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:19,430
 There were always things like chocolate and candy on your desk. 

710
00:49:20,890 --> 00:49:22,330
That was me.

711
00:49:22,330 --> 00:49:25,260
Really? Did you like me a long time ago?

712
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:27,450
Aigoo, you're going overboard again.

713
00:49:27,450 --> 00:49:30,390
You were my life saver.

714
00:49:30,390 --> 00:49:32,240
I was thankful.

715
00:49:33,260 --> 00:49:35,960
You also looked cool.

716
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:38,690
I was really shy at that time.

717
00:49:38,690 --> 00:49:42,740
But you played with others well, were cheerful

718
00:49:42,740 --> 00:49:44,460
and strong.

719
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:46,720
That's not really anything special.

720
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:49,430
It's really nothing. I guess you've got nothing worth revealing.

721
00:49:49,430 --> 00:49:54,460
It's weak? It was a pretty big secret.

722
00:49:55,820 --> 00:49:57,650
Then let's go with something a little more definitive.

723
00:49:57,650 --> 00:50:00,550
Okay, spill it. Tell me everything.

724
00:50:02,030 --> 00:50:04,150
About Hyung Jae Yi...

725
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:09,400
He's not my biological older brother.

726
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:13,050
He's actually my older cousin.

727
00:50:13,050 --> 00:50:15,830
My current parents are actually my aunt and uncle.

728
00:50:17,830 --> 00:50:22,870
My mom got remarried and left me at my dad's older brother's house.

729
00:50:23,470 --> 00:50:25,310
And she flew off to Canada.

730
00:50:27,390 --> 00:50:30,520
Then the reason that you suddenly transferred schools like that...

731
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:32,470
It was because of that.

732
00:50:34,070 --> 00:50:36,450
I wasn't even able to say my last goodbye.

733
00:50:37,910 --> 00:50:42,120
Hey, there's no reason to look at me so pitiably just because of that.

734
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:46,240
I was alright. My aunt and uncle were really good to me,

735
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:50,230
and my hyung was so good to me that he couldn't have done any better.

736
00:50:50,870 --> 00:50:56,090
Look at the way my personality changed. If I were down, do you think I would have changed like this?

737
00:51:00,910 --> 00:51:08,280
I just have one or two of the painful emotions that everyone buries in their hearts.

738
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:12,520
I just live as in the state of moving on if I can move on or of not moving on if I can't move on.

739
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:15,050
As I did, I became more and more calm about it.

740
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:18,320
You'll be like that soon, too.

741
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:23,770
You're right. I'm already calmer than I was earlier.

742
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:27,690
You have two weeks left till weightlifting competition?

743
00:51:28,870 --> 00:51:32,630
Do deal with the thing that comes up soon first. Then just wait.

744
00:51:33,180 --> 00:51:36,030
Time will take care of things naturally.

745
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:47,770
 One of the good things about one-sided love 

746
00:51:47,770 --> 00:51:50,980
 is that I can decide when to say goodbye. 

747
00:51:52,810 --> 00:51:55,440
 The heart that went out without my permission. 

748
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:58,890
 I'll take it back, today. 

749
00:52:00,230 --> 00:52:07,160
 You worked hard, my heart. You were more than passionate enough. 

750
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:18,870
Good, good, good! Tense it up!
  D-7 until Athletic Competition 

751
00:52:18,870 --> 00:52:23,340
Tense it! Perfect!

752
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:28,020
Kim Bok Joo, Gold medal! Gold Medal!

753
00:52:31,070 --> 00:52:33,980
 D-6 until Athletic Competitiom. 

754
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:41,300
 D-5 until Athletic Competitiom. 

755
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:44,460
It would be nice if you just gain  a little bit more.

756
00:52:44,460 --> 00:52:47,830
That's it, Bok Joo. Let's work just a little harder.

757
00:52:49,990 --> 00:52:52,130
 D-4 to Athletic Competition 

758
00:52:52,130 --> 00:52:59,270
 A mediocre effort is not an effort. 

759
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:04,500
 D-3 until Athletic Competitiom. 

760
00:53:15,260 --> 00:53:20,370
Here, eat this. Eat this. Eat a lot. I've got some more!
 D-2 until Athletic Competition 

761
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:27,950
 One day before the competition 

762
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:34,400
Hey, you made it! This is enough to make it, Professor!

763
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:37,390
Look at that. Look at it. I told you that she'd do it.

764
00:53:37,390 --> 00:53:42,950
You must be happy.  But I'm so much happier!

765
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:48,100
I heard you have a competition today.

766
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:49,450
Yes.

767
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:53,790
Do well. I sincerely mean it.

768
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:13,930
Aigoo, I have to wear this today!

769
00:54:23,010 --> 00:54:25,780
I knew you would be here, Kim Bok Joo.

770
00:54:25,780 --> 00:54:26,950
You're here?

771
00:54:26,950 --> 00:54:28,890
Is your condition okay?

772
00:54:28,890 --> 00:54:31,690
No, it's really not good.

773
00:54:31,690 --> 00:54:33,160
I think I will fail it.

774
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:37,340
I even spilled my protein shake on my lucky t-shirt this morning. I don't have a good feeling about this.

775
00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:39,580
What if I make a mistake, Joon Hyeong?

776
00:54:40,410 --> 00:54:45,120
Kim Bok Joo, Haneul Sports University, Weightlifting Ace.

777
00:54:47,330 --> 00:54:52,280
You won't make a mistake. You worked hard, and you've got a stronger mentality than anyone else.

778
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:55,060
You know not anyone can become an ace.

779
00:54:56,550 --> 00:55:00,860
Good, go like this. Get on the bus. I'll go cheer for you later.

780
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:04,940
Go!

781
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:10,830
Go Kim Bok Joo! I will become your strength!

782
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:16,050
Walk with some energy! You're going to a match.

783
00:55:18,630 --> 00:55:22,720
Wait, why does a new product already have a defect? Doesn't this mean that they pulled a fast one on us?

784
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:24,720
The set-up of the connection is good.

785
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:27,200
Is it possible that it's not working because you didn't plug in the cord?

786
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:30,740
Hey, am I an idiot? That's the very first thing that I checked.

787
00:55:30,740 --> 00:55:33,710
I pushed all the different buttons, but it didn't work.

788
00:55:38,100 --> 00:55:43,340
So it was the multi-tab. I didn't check that.

789
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:46,360
It sounds good. Do you want to eat something since you're here before you leave?

790
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:51,290
No, I have to go to the Sunbae Kang's opening ceremony. By the way, are you going, too?

791
00:55:51,290 --> 00:55:56,130
No, I can't. I'm on duty today. The doctor on my next shift was dispatched to the weightlifting competition.

792
00:55:56,130 --> 00:55:57,470
There's a weightlifting competition?

793
00:55:57,470 --> 00:56:00,500
Ah! Bok Joo is also going to participate in that competition today.

794
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:04,700
That competition is held at the Olympic Indoor Stadium. The clinic Sunbae Kang opens is in that direction, isn't it?

795
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:06,880
Yeah, probably.

796
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:13,010
 Olympic Indoor Stadium 

797
00:56:13,010 --> 00:56:14,090
Woon Gi, fighting!

798
00:56:14,090 --> 00:56:15,850
Fighting!

799
00:56:15,850 --> 00:56:17,320
Hyungnim, fighting!

800
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:20,390
Woon Gi, let's go with the flow!

801
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:26,100
 2016 National Weightlifting Championship 

802
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:44,900


803
00:56:46,630 --> 00:56:49,870
 Judging result : success 

804
00:56:54,150 --> 00:56:56,650
Bok Joo, it's time.

805
00:56:56,650 --> 00:56:57,760
Bok Joo, let's do well!

806
00:56:57,760 --> 00:56:59,250
Okay?

807
00:56:59,250 --> 00:57:01,690
Just be calm and do it the same way you've been doing it.

808
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:08,650
 Next contestant, Haneul Sports University, Kim Bok Joo. 

809
00:57:08,650 --> 00:57:12,460
 This is her third and final attempt at the clean and jerk. 

810
00:57:13,740 --> 00:57:17,390
 That's right Kim Bok Joo. Everything depends on this one moment. 

811
00:57:17,390 --> 00:57:23,810
 There's nothing to be nervous about. You're strong. You can do it. 

812
00:57:23,810 --> 00:57:28,170
 Don't doubt yourself, and just focus on the barbells now. 

813
00:58:05,100 --> 00:58:08,200
 Doctor. 

814
00:58:14,730 --> 00:58:16,710
Way to go!

815
00:58:26,170 --> 00:58:27,710
Bok Joo!

816
00:58:27,710 --> 00:58:30,490
Hey, Bok Joo! What are you doing? You have to hurry up and go up there!

817
00:58:52,550 --> 00:58:55,400
 We lift really heavy barbells. 

818
00:58:55,400 --> 00:59:01,140
 At that moment, we can't help it. Our veins pop out and our faces get really red. 

819
00:59:01,140 --> 00:59:05,030
 We get double and triple chins and our belly fat bulges out from our belts. 

820
00:59:05,030 --> 00:59:06,970
 It's no joke. 

821
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:12,080
 It's not an image of ourselves that we'd like to show in front of the man that we like. 

822
00:59:31,720 --> 00:59:34,000
What is it? What happened?
