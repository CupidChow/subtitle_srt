Let's go white team! Let's go white team!

5
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,310
Hey, Jeon Joon Yeong. Run properly.

6
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:45,200
If you come in last, you better watch it!

7
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,890
Get hold of yourself properly and run.

8
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:48,600
If you don't, you're going to get hit by me.

9
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:54,110
Let's go white team!
 Let's go blue team!

10
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:55,820
Let's go white team!
 Let's go blue team!

11
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:57,430
Run quickly!

12
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:58,840
Hurry!

13
00:00:58,840 --> 00:00:59,980
Hurry!

14
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:02,040
Run fast!

15
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:02,860
Hurry!

16
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:04,480
♬  What!?  ♬

17
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:10,140
Too late.

18
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,460
What is up with him?

19
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:22,550
What are you doing? Are you cleaning?

20
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:25,780
Because of you, our white team lost!

21
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:28,600
You're saying you can eat this in one bite?

22
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,510
It's true. I can eat it in one bite.

23
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:32,010
Don't kid me, Kim Bok Joo.

24
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:35,130
Hey. I'm telling you it's true.

25
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,890
He can only go backward.

26
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:43,440
What's the point speaking to a kid who can only go backward?

27
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:46,180
Get out of the way!

28
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,880
Oh no!

29
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:56,010
- Wow. Kim Bok Joo. 
- Awesome.

30
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:58,480
As expected,  that's the way Fatty is.

31
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,950
♬   How can I get your love   ♬

32
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:31,290
How long are you going to be in my arms?

33
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:32,850
Father!

34
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:38,850
Your feet can touch the bottom here.

44
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,630
This one too.

45
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:48,350
Excuse me... Thank you and I'm sorry I misunderstood you.

46
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:54,290
I didn't know that I wasn't supposed to wash the handkerchief. I'm sorry, feel better.

47
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:56,190
Kim Bok Joo!

48
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:03,580
I'm right.

49
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,160
Fatty!

50
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:12,100
You... By chance... are you that thin and scrawny backward runner?

51
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:15,760
That's right! The one who ran the race backward, the thin and scrawny, Jeong Joon Heong!

52
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:19,180
Hey, you... You've really changed!

53
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:22,210
When did you get this big!?

54
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:27,730
You've grown a lot. When you were younger, it seemed  you'd never grow tall and only grow horizontally.

55
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:29,080
It's really nice to see you!

56
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:34,200
Yeah. It's nice to see you. I'm sorry about yesterday.

57
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:37,940
I have a training, so I have to go. I'm late.

58
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,750
Ah, I knew she looked familiar.

59
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,990
Hey!

60
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:51,300
I'll coolly accept your apology. Let's call it even with the sausage.

61
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:59,640
It was nice seeing you! See you again later Fatty! Get back safely!

62
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:05,800
 Episode 2 | When you come into my heart 

63
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,100
Really!?

64
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,390
You're saying the swimmer flower boy is your elementary school classmate?

65
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:15,100
I told you he is. Back then he was really short, effeminate, and thin and scrawny.

66
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:18,140
What did he eat that he's grown so much?

67
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:22,010
He's got a crafty personality and his words are as pure as water flowing through green mountains.

68
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:25,030
I strangely feel inadequate. It's unlucky.

69
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:30,710
What do you mean it's unlucky? It's a blessing! Just link us up and I'll take care of the rest.

70
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:33,700
Do you think his eyes are on the back of his head that he'd fall for you if you tempt him?

71
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:37,610
Hey! My mom said that women who are overweight are like an unscratched lotto ticket!

72
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:42,170
If I lose weight, I'll look feline-ish and look like Han Ye Seul!

73
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:44,410
Hey, get back to your senses! Do I have to give you a—

74
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:48,200
Ah, be quiet! I'm serious right now!

75
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:52,380
The hair on the back of my neck is standing up. Something doesn't feel good.

76
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:57,220
Hey Fatty!

77
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:59,270
What, did someone just call me fat?

78
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:01,210
What was that?

79
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:02,390
Hey!

80
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:05,700
See? I told you something didn't feel good.

81
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,250
Fatty!

82
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:11,180
Let's go.

83
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:13,490
Hey, go together!

84
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,450
Where are you going? The school cafeteria?

85
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:27,780
Today, it's bulgogi. Eat a lot, Fatty.

86
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,790
Look at these shoulders! Work hard exercising!

87
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:35,740
Go.  Let's go.

88
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,980
Wait, why are you Fatty?

89
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:40,940
Was your nickname in elementary school Fatty?

90
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:42,800
He called you Fatty!

91
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,240
Fatty. Fatty. Fatty.

92
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:52,150
She eats really well. That's amazing.

93
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:55,060
How can she eat all of that?

94
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:57,920
Do you want another serving after we eat this?

95
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,290
- One more serving? 
- She seems full.

96
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:03,760
- I'm not full!
- You hesitated, you're full!
- Let's go one more round.

97
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,650
Hey, Fatty.

98
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:08,830
Huh? Fatty?

99
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:11,200
Why can't you eat well?

100
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:15,170
Oh, my bad. It's your second serving.

101
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:19,790
Eat a lot, Fatty.

102
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:22,880
Hey, Hyeong.

103
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,430
She's Fatty? Fatty?

104
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:27,520
- You weight lift, right?
- Yes!

105
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,080
- Weightlifting,
 - Fighting!

106
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:36,900
Hi, Fatty! Good Morning!

107
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:41,360
Give me a high five!

108
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,610
Give me a high five!

109
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:46,230
High five!

110
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:48,520
If you do I'll leave. Give me a high five!

111
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,360
Hey, you punk!

112
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,550
Hey. Go run!

113
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:55,300
Work hard!

114
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,420
That's just words!

115
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:15,040
Hey!

116
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:19,090
Oh! Hi, Fatty!

117
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:34,320
Jeong Joon Hyeong. Don't call me Fatty from now on.

118
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,320
I'm not the fatty I was before.

119
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,960
I warned you.

120
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:46,930
Sidenote, I can beat up boys too. Got it?

121
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:49,890
You didn't like to hear it. I'm sorry, Fatty.

122
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:51,800
- What?
- Hm.

123
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:58,970
I'm not coming.

124
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:02,900
I don't want to.

125
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:15,130
You're trying to do something again.

126
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:17,480
Why?

127
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:21,310
Come?

128
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,550
What?

129
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:32,850
- Hey!
 - I told you I hit men too.

130
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:37,030
This is my warning. Watch yourself.

131
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:47,260
Hey! It comes out automatically whenever I see you. What do you want me to do?

132
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:50,690
Once you're Fatty, you're always Fatty!

133
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:52,880
See you again next time, Fatty!

134
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,310
Her butt's heavy.

135
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:57,160
- What's wrong with you?!
 - What?

136
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,630
Don't go overboard!

137
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:02,220
The moment she walked towards us, I felt like my life was in danger!

138
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:04,220
She's part of the weightlifting program! Weightlifting!

139
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:06,060
Why are you like that to her? It's so unlike you.

140
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:11,700
I wonder why's it so fun? It's funny that Kim Bok Joo's doing weightlifting.

141
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:14,590
It's funny watching her yelling at the top of her lungs when she's pissed.

142
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:17,820
She's got a powerful kick, but nothing else has changed.

143
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:22,330
You're putting your life on the line for  fun . You're  so  accepting!

144
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,290
It's fun!

145
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:28,280
I'm so pissed! Crazy bastard, Jeong Joon Hyeong. He just suddenly had to pop out of nowhere!

146
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:31,690
Hey, it's because you're always shaking in annoyance that he does it more.

147
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:33,760
He finds it super funny.

148
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,960
And being completely honest, it's not like you have absolutely no fault in all this.

149
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,770
Who's the one that made a normal guy into a pervert?

150
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:42,660
Hey. I misunderstood because of the situation. I apologized too.

151
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:46,700
Regardless, I'm only envious of you.

152
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:52,090
Whether he teases me or not, if I had a handsome guy from the same class as me, I'd have nothing else to wish for.

153
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:55,800
How satisfying is it! Just looking at him cleanses your eyes!

154
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,690
And having that pride of knowing him!

155
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:00,540
Cleansing your eyes, my ass. My eyes are being strained to the point I could die.

156
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:03,140
Even though you say that, your heart flutters a bit, right?

157
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:04,700
What the heck?

158
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:08,590
A classmate that handsome suddenly started hanging around you.

159
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:09,950
Yet you say your heart isn't racing?

160
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:12,990
If they dated, her heart would definitely race!

161
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:17,340
Hey! What's so handsome about him? And so what if he  is  handsome? Does that mean everyone has to fall for him?

162
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:21,040
From the beginning, unlike you two, I'm not interested in men!

163
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:25,130
Is this the time to be worried about dating? I'm so busy with weightlifting!

164
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,960
Of course you fall for guys when they're handsome.

165
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:39,420
Welcome.

166
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:49,220
Yes, this is Bok Chicken!

167
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:52,180
Yes, the beer is served!

168
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:54,980
The orders are a bit behind, so you need to wait 30 minutes.

169
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:58,560
Yes, I will go there quickly. Thank you!

170
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:01,520
A half-and-half, Dad!

171
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:05,630
Excuse me?

172
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,800
You heard me, right Dad? A half-and-half.

173
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:19,050
I'm not deaf, so just go back to school. I'm firing you as a part-timer from this moment on.

174
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:24,530
Seriously? Boss Kim, you're completely one-sided! Fine.

175
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:26,590
What?

176
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:30,940
Would I be doing this because I want to get my palms read? Give me some money and I'll work.

177
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:34,150
If you don't, I'm going to turn you in for labor laws! Employing without pay!

178
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:35,520
Shut up, you brat!

179
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:39,550
Then give me the money that I spent feeding, clothing, and raising you for so many years!

180
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:45,170
You already eat  twice  as much as other kids, and I blew my back out trying to support you, but you don't even do practice!

181
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:48,630
You're even worse, you bastard! Why did you call her uselessly?

182
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:50,700
Then should we not accept the group customers for the first time in a long time?

183
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,960
Hyung, you do the cooking and I do the serving. Who'll do the delivery then?

184
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,440
I ought to... You did nothing right either!

185
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,670
Excuse me, please give us some popped corn.

186
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:58,840
Yes!

187
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,130
- It's delicious, isn't it?
 - It's killer.

188
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:03,950
Oh, my. Oh, yes. I'll bring some popped corn!

189
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:07,920
Hey, buddy. Should we each eat a whole chicken?

190
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,730
- This restaurant makes really good popped corn.
- Okay.

191
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:11,310
Please give us a lot!

192
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:15,920
Wow, how many servings of popped corn are those bastards going to shove down after only ordering two glasses of beer?

193
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,740
Don't speak about our beloved oppas any way that you want to!

194
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:20,440
Can't you tell?!

195
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:25,870
The pride of our Haneul University, the national representative in shooting. It's Oppa Jong Seok.

196
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:28,800
Those kind of people have to come here a lot for our chicken restaurant to be a success.

197
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,160
Uncle, you really don't know how to do business.

198
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,210
He looks just like mine.

199
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:35,570
Just bring the popped corn.

200
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,130
Don't make me pop  your  corn.

201
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:45,050
- Sunbae, here!
- This is yours.

202
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:48,320
Oh, thanks! You're suffering a lot doing tedious work.

203
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,440
Hey, you don't have mine?

204
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,810
Yes. Sunbae, you don't really put out any laundry for us to do.

205
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:56,120
Hey, just give it to them! Stop flipping the same clothes inside out and wearing them again!

206
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,730
Hey, there's something I need to make  absolutely  clear.

207
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:04,650
I swear, in all  honesty  it's not because I'm  damn dirty  and  lazy! It's because I'm thinking of these kids.

208
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:07,710
Hey, I just so happen to be hungry right now. For these kids who worked so hard,

209
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:10,570
treat us all to a snack!

210
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:15,670
Hey, you're the one who  just happens  to be hungry. Why do I have to be the one to buy snacks for them?

211
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,090
I don't know if I should treat you, but you guys want me to?

212
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:22,400
Thank you!

213
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,420
- You want it?
- Yes!

214
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:26,780
- Then let's go!
 - Go!

215
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:29,520
- Let's go!
 - Let's go!!!

216
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:32,030
Jeong Joon Hyeong!

217
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:41,630
What the heck? Why is there a vanity here?

218
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:44,710
Did this Ahjussi pick something up somewhere again?

219
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:51,480
What are you doing right now?

220
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:56,730
I don't know if this popped corn will suit your taste.

221
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:58,990
Please eat a lot.

222
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:00,430
Wait, wait.

223
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:03,960
Have I possibly seen you somewhere?

224
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:10,920
Wait, you know...that patient from that weekend drama

225
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:14,810
that was in the bed next to the main character when he got admitted to the hospital.

226
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:16,420
Ah...

227
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:19,380
Yes, I think... I think that is me.

228
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:20,860
Yes, it's me!

229
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:23,430
I didn't have much screen time. Your sight is amazing!

230
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:26,240
Wow, this is my first time meeting a celebrity. It's so fascinating.

231
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,500
You're so handsome.

232
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:30,010
You're really handsome.

233
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:35,530
Celebrities also drink alcohol, fart and poop just like other people.

234
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:40,100
Jeez, why are you acting like that? You look like the main character from a comic.  (Reference to W) 

235
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:43,720
Go on and eat all of this. Eat all you want.

236
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:54,990
Father, what's with the vanity at home? You picked it up from the street, didn't you.

237
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:57,150
N-No, you brat!

238
00:15:57,150 --> 00:16:00,630
It's because you always throw a fit saying there aren't any big mirrors at home!

239
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:03,330
So you paid money and bought it?  You  did?

240
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:05,140
Of course I did!

241
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:08,950
I bought it off the internet not too long ago.

242
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:14,260
And you were making a fuss asking what kind of athlete needs a mirror. You're such a tsundere.

243
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:16,030
What? Pansy? (Tchon-ddegi)

244
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:20,430
Tsundere. A man who's actually attentive even though he acts like he's not.

245
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:23,780
Ha. What foreign language...

246
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:26,710
Dae Woo! Go out and deliver this.

247
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:32,480
Aigoo, how could a celebrity that people recognize deliver? Ah, really.

248
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,950
Dad, I'll be right back. Where is it?

249
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:43,770
- School.
- Got it.

250
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:47,720
I-I... I could have gone, though.

251
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:02,190
What the heck?

252
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:06,730
It's already been over thirty minutes! Should we cancel our order and order from somewhere else?

253
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:09,760
Why? That place gives so many delicious chickens...

254
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,530
They'll get here. Just wait and stop whining.

255
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:16,220
Ah, I'm starving!

256
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:20,070
This is Bok Chicken! Chicken! Here's the chicken.

257
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:22,390
The chicken is here! Bok Chicken!

258
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:24,930
- Yes, yes!
- Over here!

259
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:33,720
You deliver chicken, too?

260
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:37,330
One fried, one seasoned, one teriyaki. That will be $38.

261
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:39,290
Ah. Yes, yes.

262
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:43,580
You're a jack of all trades. Are you able to work a part-time job while doing your sport?

263
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:45,940
That'll be $38.

264
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:49,730
Just give it to her. She's waiting.

265
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,100
 Looks like she's having a hard time again. 

266
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:00,220
 I'll have to let her rest awhile. 

267
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:02,690
Let me try it first.

268
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:05,340
We'll eat it and then I'll pay you if it's good.

269
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:06,880
So why don't you go and sit down over there for a while?

270
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:11,680
A large person is dripping meat juice, so this heart of mine is really anxious.

271
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,770
Let's eat!

272
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:14,200
I want the drumstick!

273
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,800
Right, let's eat. Let's eat.

274
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:18,500
- Give me the drumstick.
- Alright, let's eat.

275
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,260
I'll treat you guys.

276
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:26,550
I do owe you something, so I'll treat you. Eat up.

277
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,830
Hey, hey. Let's eat first.

278
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:34,910
- Here.
- Let's eat, let's eat.

279
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:59,410
Aigoo, where is it?

280
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:10,810
Ah, I should've given it to her without joking, what am I putting myself through all this for?

281
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:16,760
 Bok Chicken 

282
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,990
I found it!

283
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:25,290
Just go. You've got training tomorrow.

284
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:27,990
I got it. Go back in, Dad.

285
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:29,970
- Dad?
- Ah!

286
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:32,360
This is the pay from the chicken.

287
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,660
They didn't pay with card?

288
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:37,760
Yeah, they gave me cash.

289
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,400
Go back in, Dad. I'll go to the hospital later.

290
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,870
Forget it. Why do you keep coming?

291
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:43,640
I understand, Boss Kim. Please go back in and rest!

292
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,390
- Go.
- Ah, just go back in.

293
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:46,660
Go back in, Sir!

294
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:49,200
Go on back in, Sir!

295
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:04,330
Punk, she's a devoted daughter.

296
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:16,290
You're telling us to ride this? This thing?

297
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:19,060
Why all of a sudden? Did the bus break down?

298
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:20,600
I guess so.

299
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,170
Ah, these people! They should tell us first!

300
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:26,670
Hey, hey forget that. We don't have any time, so hurry up and get on.

301
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:29,570
- No, I think this is not it.
 - If we ride on that bus...

302
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:31,580
Hey, shh.

303
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:33,290
Do you guys know how much of a relief this is?

304
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:38,500
It's a relief Hyeong Cheol had to get home because of his great-grandmother's funeral. If we had that pig with us too then-ugh.

305
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,300
- Feel grateful and get on quickly.
 - Thank you.

306
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:43,240
- Hey, I said get on.
- Coach!

307
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,830
Guys!

308
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:47,740
Wait!

309
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:50,300
Wait wait!

310
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:55,630
I was worried I'd be late, so I rode a taxi here.

311
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:58,740
Mom said I didn't have to take her to the cemetery.

312
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:02,920
Hong Cheol, weren't you supposed to be going to visit your grandmother's cemetery?

313
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:06,020
- Get on. Hurry up and get on.
 - Let's go.

314
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:09,960
Hey, Hong Cheol. You should've really gone to the cemetery with her, you rascal.

315
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,270
- Mom said...
 - Hey, hurry up and get on!

316
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,940
That's right, that's right.

317
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:15,680
Get on.

318
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,190
It's so cramped!

319
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:20,090
Aigo, so cramped.

320
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:22,780
Ow, seriously!

321
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:25,930
Hey! Sunbae, not there!

322
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,440
Hey, move over.

323
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,630
- Ow, ow!
- You stand!

324
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:35,300
Sorry.

325
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:38,470
Don't come here! Don't!

326
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:40,420
It's fine! It's fine.

327
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:44,330
Wait, wait, wait! Stay still! Ah, seriously.

328
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:47,950
How the hell do these people think this is working!

329
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:49,970
Wait here!

330
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:56,890
Yes, thank you!

331
00:21:56,890 --> 00:21:58,940
Hey, are you happy? Huh?

332
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:04,290
Aigoo, how nice.

333
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:09,600
What's with this? They've never complied when we complained.

334
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,220
He said that we'd get a 30% cut of our operating expenses.

335
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:16,490
What?! What is that? He already cut 10%!

336
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:18,680
He said that he raised the price last year, so he won't raise it anymore.

337
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:23,490
Well, it's the superintendent's school. He said that he wouldn't pay much for our meal so we should eat less.

338
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:25,660
If we say anything else, he'll just get pissed.

339
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,170
Wow, he's too much, seriously!

340
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:32,410
He should just tell them not to breathe! He's going to cut down their meals?

341
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:33,650
How the hell are they going to lift weights without that!?

342
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:36,250
The kids are looking. Smile.

343
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:38,860
Coach! Hurry up and get on!

344
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:41,390
The kids would probably feel something if you feed them.

345
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:43,780
It could become a source of motivation!

346
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:48,260
Go! Go!

347
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:49,990
Why wouldn't you get chicken delivered?

348
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:52,900
Oh, welcome! Please have a seat.

349
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:55,470
Hey, you said that you'd buy us lunch!

350
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:59,530
Hey, will the sky fall just because you eat chicken for lunch again?

351
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:03,030
Sir! Oh, we'd like two orders of fried chicken and one order of seasoned chicken.

352
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:06,130
Two fried and one seasoned. Alright, I understand.

353
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:16,130
 Winner
Second Place 

354
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,920
Let's go!

355
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,680
I'm ready to pay.

356
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:31,770
Two orders of fried, one seasoned, and a cola. That's a total of $46.

357
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:35,680
Here you go.

358
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:40,600
Also this...

359
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:43,210
I couldn't give it to you last time.

360
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:45,480
When?

361
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:49,770
The... It's been maybe 2, 3, 4, 5 weeks?

362
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:51,280
Thank you for the meal!

363
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:54,390
Student! Student!

364
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:57,430
Hyung, what's wrong?

365
00:23:57,430 --> 00:24:02,320
I don't remember letting him put it on a tab, but he says I did.

366
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,980
Then, maybe I did?

367
00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:07,860
Oh! Ow.

368
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,650
It hurts.

369
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:15,080
You've all worked hard today. When you get home, remember to loosen up what you've worked out with sauna.

370
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:17,760
Do some stretching before you go to bed.

371
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,460
You worked hard! Alright, dismissed!

372
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,550
Dismissed!

373
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:26,230
You worked hard! Go on, go. Go on.

374
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:28,930
Coach.

375
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:32,600
What, we said you're dismissed.

376
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:35,600
You said that we'd go out to eat after we finished today's training.

377
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:37,770
Out to eat?

378
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:42,090
- That's right.
- You said that we'd go out to eat together.

379
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:44,330
Did I say something like that?

380
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:47,320
- Of course you did!
 - You can't just  forget  that!

381
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,840
Take us out to eat!

382
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:51,950
Hey! Alright! Alright! We'll just do it! Let's do it!

383
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:54,070
- Let's go out to eat!
 - YAY!

384
00:24:54,950 --> 00:25:01,700


385
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:05,090
Since when did a hamburger become the menu for eating out?

386
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:06,320
I know, right?

387
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,520
- Isn't this just a snack?
 - Hey!

388
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:14,980
If you eat it during meal time, it's a meal. When you eat it in between, it's a snack. You're all in over your heads.

389
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:18,140
- Those who don't want to eat it don't eat it. 
 - We'll eat well!

390
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:32,160
Eat more of this, I don't really have an appetite.

391
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:35,730
No, Professor. Just eat.

392
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:38,730
Hey, Hong Cheol, you eat this.

393
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:42,060
I ate some ramyun secretly earlier, so I'm not really that hungry.

394
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:43,930
I don't have to eat it.

395
00:25:43,930 --> 00:25:47,320
Eat it, hurry up and eat it.

396
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:51,160
It feels like I'm not digesting well because I didn't chew up the ramyun enough.

397
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:54,370
Maybe I need to prick my finger, ow. (  remedy for indigestion )

398
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,320
Punks, let's go.

399
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,440
Where to, Professor?

400
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,820
You think they'll be able to lift weights with a piece of hamburger?

401
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:05,290
Let's go eat some meat!

402
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:09,450
- Yes, let's go!
- Professor!

403
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:11,140
Where are we going?

404
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:34,870
Honey! Where did you go without answering my call?

405
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:42,200
Where did I leave my phone?

406
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:45,280
Ah, I left it in there. I lost my mind for a second there.

407
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:47,610
You're as pretty as always.

408
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:51,420
It's been a while ex-boyfriend.

409
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:54,900
Yeah, it's been a while.

410
00:26:56,700 --> 00:27:00,570
I guess Tae-Reung gives good food, you look great.

411
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:06,590
That food is good. But I came because I missed you.

412
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:11,970
If you're just testing me, then stop.

413
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:14,290
I'm peaceful right now.

414
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:19,030
I know. I was just throwing a joke out there, because it's awkward.

415
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:23,890
But it is nice seeing your face.

416
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:26,670
It's good that you look okay.

417
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:30,120
I have to get going.

418
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:34,500
Oh, go. I can keep acting like I know you, right?

419
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:37,840
Of course. It's corny to ignore each other.

420
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:40,030
I'm going.

421
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:46,700
Eat up!

422
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:49,390
Auntie, 3 more servings of galbi please!

423
00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:52,790
Hey! You better get the portions right. Raw-Seasoned-Fried-Cold, got it?

424
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:55,870
- Of course!
- It's always RSFC at a meat place.
 Unseasoned meat, Seasoned meat, Fried Rice, Cold noodles 

425
00:28:55,870 --> 00:28:58,430
This! Is! Real! BBQ! Dinner! Swag!

426
00:28:58,430 --> 00:29:03,110
- But what does "Raw, Seasoned, Fried, Cold" mean, Sunbae?
 - Ye Bi!

427
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:07,820
What the heck, Ye Bi? Are you sitting here when you don't even know what that means?

428
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:09,860
Okay, listen up.

429
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:14,380
At a meat place, if you just clutter around, ordering whatever you see, then you end up getting full, uselessly.

430
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:16,600
This "Raw, Marinated, Fried, Cold"

431
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,710
was made in order to lessen those risks.

432
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:22,410
You can call it an efficient course set.

433
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:26,220
First!
   

434
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:28,190
First, you eat raw meat.

435
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:30,420
After that, marinated meat!

436
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:34,140
 Complete Mastery of BBQ Restaurants, Level 2: Seasoned Meat 

437
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:38,530
Then when you feel that you filled your stomach with enough meat,

438
00:29:38,530 --> 00:29:42,020
then the always-needed course at a meat joint, fried rice!

439
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:43,580
Auntie, please bring us 5 servings of fried rice.

440
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:46,830
 Complete Mastery of BBQ Restaurants, Level 3: Fried Rice 

441
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:51,860
 Complete Mastery of BBQ Restaurants, Level 4: Cold Noodles 

442
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,200
If you cleanly finish up with cold noodles last,

443
00:29:56,200 --> 00:30:00,910
you can say you've perfectly cleared the meat meal.

444
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:14,750
Juniors, how do you feel after personally experiencing Raw-Seasoned-Fried-Cold's training?

445
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:16,570
- We respect you, seniors.
 - We respect you, seniors.

446
00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:20,410
Ah, you cutie pies. Have some wraps.

447
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:25,650
Coach Choi, eat some too. Eating is how you survive.

448
00:30:25,650 --> 00:30:28,880
Let's eat to our deaths today too.

449
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:33,830
- Ah, this box too.
 - Alright.

450
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:36,910
- Good work, Honey.
 - Oh?

451
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:39,330
- That scared me.
 - Goodness, who is that?

452
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:43,830
- You rascal, you scared me!
 - You scared me!

453
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,730
I'm hungry, Mom.

454
00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:50,460
- Do you know what time it is right now? You still haven't eaten?
 - I couldn't eat.

455
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:52,620
- You've lost so much weight.
 - Then, should we have some delicious meat?

456
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:54,620
- Oh, that sounds good!
 - Goodness.

457
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:57,060
- Give me a minute for this.
 - Okay.

458
00:30:57,060 --> 00:31:00,200
- Help your dad. 
 - Dad, let's go together!

459
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:39,370
  Merry Christmas... I'm proud of you... I miss you, Joon Hyeong. 
From Mom,  Canada. 

460
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:44,840
From Mom...

461
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:21,520
Ah, this hurts my pride! One stroke? The difference is just one stroke? I'm the one and only swimmer!

462
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:24,180
Hey, I know that you went easy on me.

463
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:27,650
You rascal, how dare you play with your older brother? You grew a lot, Jeong Joon Hyeong.

464
00:32:27,650 --> 00:32:29,440
Was it obvious?

465
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,840
Still, you're much better than an amateur.

466
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:35,960
- Hey, I used to swim too.
 - That's what I mean.

467
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:39,440
If you're a doctor, you shouldn't have athletic abilities. How can someone be so perfect?

468
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:43,490
You're such a jerk.  You even have talent in classical music and the fine arts!

469
00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:46,990
Hey, you're really good at swimming.

470
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:51,910
Good, my ass. Would someone who's good be disqualified at very chance possible? I'm not an idiot.

471
00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:13,950
Here.

472
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:25,390
Does the start bother you that much?

473
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:26,890
Of course.

474
00:33:27,490 --> 00:33:31,800
Swimming is as essential to me as eating and sleeping are. Of course, I'm concerned.

475
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:35,790
Hyung.

476
00:33:37,010 --> 00:33:39,870
If I hadn't done swimming,

477
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:43,970
would I have just been a regular college student?

478
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:49,760
I would have run a few part-time jobs and traveled around the country during breaks.

479
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,140
What? Do you want to go on vacation?

480
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:57,130
No, rather than that, swimming isn't working out as I want it to.

481
00:33:57,130 --> 00:33:59,430
I'm just iffy.

482
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:07,560
You miss your Mom, don't you?

483
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:18,220
Well, I always miss Mom. Our mom is amazing.

484
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:19,540
Not our mom.

485
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:24,050
I'm over 20, I can't be whining about my mom. I hate it.

486
00:34:24,050 --> 00:34:25,800
Let's go home.

487
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:52,910
Now, Professor!

488
00:34:55,530 --> 00:34:56,620
Oh...

489
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:59,070
You slept here again?

490
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:04,730
I told you to go sleep at home. Sleeping outside will become a habit.

491
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:09,380
I guess I fell asleep here. You're here early.

492
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:11,240
Professor,

493
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:13,620
can't you two just get back together?

494
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:15,570
- What?
 - I mean,

495
00:35:15,570 --> 00:35:19,790
is being your friend's guarantor a sin worthy of death? How can she ask for a divorce because of that?

496
00:35:19,790 --> 00:35:22,690
How can life be like this?

497
00:35:22,690 --> 00:35:27,930
You're always drinking because you miss your children and pay child support, and it's not as if that's a manageable amount.

498
00:35:27,930 --> 00:35:32,580
Your wife wears  clothes bought only at the high-end department store, doesn't she? Also,  she buys prepared food there.

499
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:41,650
- Why are you getting angry?
 - When did I ever get angry? I'm just saying this out of frustration.

500
00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:44,870
Da Hee is still young. My wife is a bit immature.

501
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:47,880
Not every young person is immature.

502
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:55,550
I'm sorry if I was out of place but from now on, please don't use your personal money.

503
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:58,270
I'll take care of it within the budget.

504
00:35:58,270 --> 00:36:01,360
What will you take care of? It's fine.

505
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:05,320
I'll do it somehow, so you just need to sleep at home.

506
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:07,680
Please just!

507
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:10,170
Please just take care of your health.

508
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:12,460
Seriously...

509
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:16,050
Ah, look at him, look at him. He has digestion problems.

510
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:28,750
Ah, I'm really feeling lazy. I should've bought this earlier. Why didn't I?

511
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:49,050
What do you pray for so earnestly each morning?

512
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:51,320
A gold medal?

513
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:55,900
Whether I pray or chant a Buddhist prayer, why do you care?

514
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:59,790
Really? Train well today, don't get hurt.

515
00:37:06,830 --> 00:37:09,880
What's wrong with him? He's not even provoking me.

516
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:12,420
Switch.

517
00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:18,250
I'm sorry I'm late!

518
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:20,680
Coach Choi, what is that?

519
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:23,290
Ah, this? These are snacks for the kids.

520
00:37:23,290 --> 00:37:26,830
Kids, gather, gather! Gather!

521
00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:32,180
Hey, you've already digested what you ate, right? Let's have a simple snack before we leave. Ta-dah!

522
00:37:34,770 --> 00:37:37,230
Here, take it. Here.

523
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,700
- Thank you!
 - We'll eat well!

524
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:42,270
- Professor.
 - No, it's fine.

525
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:44,910
Come on, take it. I'm sure you couldn't even eat breakfast properly.

526
00:37:44,910 --> 00:37:47,040
I had a bowl of rice soup.

527
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:50,140
- By the way, when did you leave?
 - Coach,

528
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:54,080
This tastes different. Isn't this from Elephant Snack Shop?

529
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:56,880
I bought them from a different store. Aren't they good?

530
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:00,000
- It tastes bad.
 - I think it tastes good.

531
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,040
- This tastes really bad.
 - I don't like it.

532
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,280
- This tastes different.
 - The ham tastes different.

533
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:09,150
Hey, all kimbap tastes the same.  Meat is meat. Just eat it!

534
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:11,370
You rascals, you've gotten too entitled!

535
00:38:11,370 --> 00:38:14,230
- Thank you for the meal.
 - Thank you for the meal.

536
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:16,670
- Thank you for the meal.
 - Thank you.

537
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:19,920
Take your mark.

538
00:38:32,170 --> 00:38:35,080
  Go, go, go! Come on! Faster! 

539
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:52,990
Good work.

540
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:56,790
- You worked hard today.
 - Hey, come on. Hurry, hurry, hurry!

541
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:03,410
I might lose all of my hair at this rate.

542
00:39:03,410 --> 00:39:06,060
- Do you want some too?
 - Yeah, give it to me.

543
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:11,760
Jeong Joon Hyeong, I heard that you received an offer to be Choi Tae Hoon's partner

544
00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:16,870
- but you rejected him. Is it true?
 - What?!

545
00:39:16,870 --> 00:39:22,010
You're awesome! You even declined a world star's offer to be his partner!

546
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:27,140
But you should have just accepted. While being his partner, you could have earned some money

547
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:31,830
and got to travel overseas with him. Isn't that better?

548
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:36,840
Having too much pride can be a loss sometimes.

549
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:46,840
Ugh, that sociopath! Ugh, that thing! I'm certain he feels inferior compared to you, ugh!

550
00:39:54,710 --> 00:39:57,860
Hey, are you okay?

551
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:01,660
Joon Hyeong.

552
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:05,500
You ...

553
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,400
What do you think? It'd be better to do that, wouldn't it?

554
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:12,980
I was thinking about offering Joon Hyeong psychotherapy anyway.

555
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:17,730
But some athletes reject therapy overall.

556
00:40:18,970 --> 00:40:24,260
Jeong Jae Yi, you have a talent for pressuring someone so nicely that they can't reject you.

557
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:25,940
Do it.

558
00:40:26,930 --> 00:40:29,800
Either way, it sounds like you're insulting me.

559
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:37,330
What is this? All crinkled up.

560
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:43,920
I'll do it.

561
00:40:56,330 --> 00:40:57,790
There you go.

562
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:07,630
What? It was you that called me? Not the doctor?

563
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:08,550
Did I surprise you?

564
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:12,730
I was wondering why he kept bugging me to give him some coffee, but I see that you were his objective.

565
00:41:12,730 --> 00:41:16,670
That's not it! I was nearby so I just stopped by on the way.

566
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:18,270
We saw each other this morning. Why do we need to see each other again?

567
00:41:18,270 --> 00:41:22,780
Hey, can't I see you again and again? You're making me sad.

568
00:41:22,870 --> 00:41:24,970
You brothers are really unusual.

569
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,190
Why don't you get filming together in ''Taegeukki: Brotherhood Of War'?

570
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:32,080
No no, we're two sides of a whole. The older bro who's so kind but unattractive

571
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:34,720
and the little bro who's bad but totally attractive.

572
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:38,370
- You come here. Let me put this bandage on your mouth.
 - I'm sorry.

573
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:40,730
I'm sorry, Hyung. I was wrong.

574
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:44,140
I thought about this a bit.

575
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,500
What do you think about getting some counseling?

576
00:41:49,290 --> 00:41:54,280
There are a lot of my famous  seniors in that field. You could get introduced to them too.

577
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:57,100
That's the only thing you've thought about all day, isn't it?

578
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:59,930
Anyway, you've got such a tiring personality.

579
00:41:59,930 --> 00:42:05,630
Hey, it's better than not getting any. Athletes usually get mental counseling.

580
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:09,440
Joon Hyeong.

581
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:14,590
I understand, so just text me the date and time.

582
00:42:14,590 --> 00:42:16,440
I'll go.

583
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:20,560
That's right, you thought well. You just have to try it at first.

584
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,560
Okay.

585
00:42:25,850 --> 00:42:30,590
- I didn't bring an umbrella...
 - Take this, I can just run.

586
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:33,140
It's not pouring that hard, let's go together.

587
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:38,820
Two men together? Are you nuts?

588
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:57,640
This looks really similar to my vanity.

589
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:04,150
 Searching for a vanity: Lost around November 16 at 3PM. Someone took our vanity that we put out to decorate. We did not throw it away, so please return it. 

590
00:43:07,310 --> 00:43:10,980
Ah, seriously! Dad, seriously!

591
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:15,890
Why do you keep picking that up? Are we beggars or something?!

592
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:20,240
I told you I thought someone left it out because it was garbage.

593
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:25,350
I can't deal with you. Why do you keep picking things up from the street!? Are we some junk yard?

594
00:43:25,350 --> 00:43:30,120
I got it. I'll take it out. That's all I have to do.

595
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:37,270
Don't! You'll just faint again!

596
00:43:37,270 --> 00:43:42,980
What am I supposed to do then? Dae Ho already fled to play pool.

597
00:43:44,290 --> 00:43:51,040
I'm going insane. Why did he pick this up? Aren't I supposed to keep this out of the rain?

598
00:43:52,670 --> 00:43:55,040
Come on, signal.

599
00:44:09,830 --> 00:44:12,940
- Do you want some help? It looks hard to carry.
- What?

600
00:44:12,940 --> 00:44:14,840
No, no, I'm all right.

601
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:26,590
Go ahead.

602
00:44:26,590 --> 00:44:29,200
Oh, thank you.

603
00:44:52,590 --> 00:44:58,240
Where are you heading? I'm going that way too, so I'll hold the umbrella up for you.

604
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:00,680
Oh, I'm okay though.

605
00:45:01,530 --> 00:45:07,180
People will curse at me for making a woman carry something like this.

606
00:45:07,180 --> 00:45:11,690
Pardon?    A woman...? 

607
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:23,450
I'll help you.

608
00:45:23,450 --> 00:45:26,910
No, no, it's okay.

609
00:45:27,590 --> 00:45:30,320
His voice is so nice too...

610
00:45:39,810 --> 00:45:45,420
 You crazy heart, get a hold of yourself, he'll hear you. 

611
00:46:04,510 --> 00:46:06,840
Right here.

612
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:28,850
Thank you.

613
00:46:28,850 --> 00:46:32,720
Well, it was on my way home. You can keep using it.

614
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:35,030
No, no! I just have to go that way a little bit.

615
00:46:35,030 --> 00:46:38,720
That's far. I'm right over here.

616
00:46:40,930 --> 00:46:43,930
Ah. Thank you.

617
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:51,390
Ah, this way.

618
00:46:56,450 --> 00:46:58,400
A woman.

619
00:47:00,950 --> 00:47:04,820
A woman? A woman?

620
00:47:05,610 --> 00:47:09,930
Woman... Jeez.

621
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:15,560
Yes? This is a woman... I mean, Kim Bok Joo.

622
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:19,800
Yes, Seon Ok. What?

623
00:47:25,910 --> 00:47:30,500
Sunbae! Sunbae Eun Gi, are you okay?

624
00:47:31,710 --> 00:47:37,040
Sunbae! Are you okay? Are you alright? What happened? Sunbae!

625
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:39,660
Are you alright? What should we do? Everyone is...

626
00:47:39,660 --> 00:47:42,230
Jeong Ran! Are you okay?

627
00:47:42,230 --> 00:47:45,730
- Oh, you're already here?
 - I feel like I'm dying.

628
00:47:45,730 --> 00:47:49,760
- Professor!
 - Oh, oh.

629
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:54,150
You're here, Bok Joo. We're okay. We just got like this after we ate some kimbap.

630
00:47:54,150 --> 00:47:57,670
They said that it's just mild food poisoning, so they just have to get a shot.

631
00:47:58,310 --> 00:48:00,490
That's a relief.

632
00:48:02,890 --> 00:48:06,240
Professor, your shoes...

633
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:11,670
Oh my, when did these fly off? I'm so old I don't know notice these things. Hold on.

634
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:19,080
You were really shocked, weren't you? We've always eaten that kimbap, so why is it doing this now? What was in it?

635
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:24,630
Coach, it's that Elephant Street Food, right? You have to be clear with them on things like this.

636
00:48:24,630 --> 00:48:29,230
No, it was me.

637
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:34,970
I made that kimbap.

638
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:40,690
Everyone caught food poisoning from the kimbap that I made.

639
00:48:41,950 --> 00:48:48,170
I shouldn't have bought expired ingredients, I'm insane.

640
00:48:48,170 --> 00:48:50,620
I must have been crazy!

641
00:49:00,030 --> 00:49:02,640
You're being a baby.

642
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:05,070
Pretending you can't even walk!

643
00:49:09,340 --> 00:49:13,480
Seon Ok looks completely fine. How many rolls did you scarf that you're still like this?

644
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:17,820
Seon Ok just has a steel stomach! She grew up eating everything and anything in the countryside.

645
00:49:17,820 --> 00:49:21,900
Hey, I guess you're feeling better. You couldn't even talk before.

646
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:23,880
I think my stomach's a little slimmer now.

647
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:29,340
Ah, that's right! Hey Bok Joo, what was that earlier about Coach making kimbap?

648
00:49:30,030 --> 00:49:32,780
Maybe the coach was trying to take our operation expense money.

649
00:49:32,780 --> 00:49:37,080
Hey! You still don't know the coach? I should sew up your mouth.

650
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:40,830
Why are you getting mad, you wench?! I'm a patient.

651
00:49:40,830 --> 00:49:43,180
Then why did she do that?

652
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:51,770
Yes, Sunbae Eun Gi. This is Bok Joo.

653
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:07,520
I'm sorry, Coach Choi. I don't have any ability.

654
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:12,270
Why, Professor? It's my fault.

655
00:50:12,270 --> 00:50:17,310
I just bought expired food to save some money, thinking how lucky I was...

656
00:50:17,310 --> 00:50:19,240
I'm sorry.

657
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:22,830
No. No matter what,

658
00:50:24,050 --> 00:50:26,890
I should've defended that operations budget.

659
00:50:35,150 --> 00:50:37,530
Why aren't you guys resting?

660
00:50:37,530 --> 00:50:40,930
Professor, Coach.

661
00:50:40,930 --> 00:50:46,170
You guys, make sure to take your medicine. Everyone but Bok Joo, rest tomorrow instead of training.

662
00:50:46,170 --> 00:50:50,800
Professor, we all... heard from Bok Joo.

663
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:55,050
I think we were immature in not realizing that our budget had been cut.

664
00:50:57,020 --> 00:51:00,210
I've always had a big mouth.

665
00:51:02,890 --> 00:51:06,260
So we all had a discussion.

666
00:51:14,350 --> 00:51:20,140
From now on, we'll only have snacks once every three days, and that being either one kimbap or one hamburger per person.

667
00:51:20,140 --> 00:51:24,830
We decided to store the knockwurst sausages bought with each one's personal money for preparing when we're hungry.

668
00:51:24,830 --> 00:51:27,060
Not large, but medium-size.

669
00:51:27,060 --> 00:51:32,590
We decided to use the necessary items such as the tissues in the common area instead of  in our practice room.

670
00:51:32,590 --> 00:51:36,690
We also decided to have our outing meals at Bok Chicken only after we have a competition.

671
00:51:36,690 --> 00:51:39,520
Bok Joo said she'd use her 50% family discount.

672
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:41,520
That is all!

673
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:43,980
Ah, seriously.

674
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:48,040
Hey! Who told you to have that kind of discussion?

675
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:51,480
Huh? Do you really want me to chew you out?

676
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:55,260
We know well that our school doesn't budget for the outing meals and snacks.

677
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:59,140
We always took it as a definite thing, but it does cost money.

678
00:52:03,350 --> 00:52:06,130
We'll be more mature in the future.

679
00:52:06,130 --> 00:52:07,800
We'll work really hard!

680
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:10,890
We'll work hard!

681
00:52:17,790 --> 00:52:21,960
Alright. Well...

682
00:52:23,420 --> 00:52:27,750
After all this passes, it'll just be a memory.

683
00:52:27,750 --> 00:52:30,570
It'll be a source of motivation as well.

684
00:52:32,130 --> 00:52:38,020
Let's repay this sorrow properly at the National Games.

685
00:52:38,020 --> 00:52:40,730
- Okay? 
 - Yes!

686
00:52:40,730 --> 00:52:43,230
- Are you confident? 
 - Yes!

687
00:52:43,230 --> 00:52:45,000
- How many gold medals are we going to win?
- One hundred, sir!

688
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,180
Two hundred, sir!

689
00:52:47,220 --> 00:52:49,260
About four.

690
00:52:49,260 --> 00:52:51,990
Let's go for three. Please.

691
00:52:52,970 --> 00:52:55,980
If you don't win them, I'll just...

692
00:54:53,430 --> 00:54:57,130
Here you go. Coffee I made myself.

693
00:54:57,130 --> 00:54:59,230
There are a lot of question, aren't there?

694
00:54:59,230 --> 00:55:02,760
It seems I'm going to vomit. It's not even the College Scholastic Ability Test.

695
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:06,000
This is the basic information for counseling. Just suffer  today.

696
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:09,580
We can talk seriously after the results come out.

697
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:17,690
Ahh. They told me you're a promising swimmer so I feel a heavy responsibility.

698
00:55:17,690 --> 00:55:20,090
Finish this within one hour.

699
00:55:20,090 --> 00:55:22,840
- This?
 - Fighting!

700
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:24,380
- Really?
 - Begin!

701
00:55:24,380 --> 00:55:26,090
Aigoo, how can I do this in one hour?

702
00:55:26,090 --> 00:55:28,210
Your joke is a bit harsh.

703
00:55:28,210 --> 00:55:30,740
You have 59 minutes left.

704
00:55:33,590 --> 00:55:35,270
 Weightlifting Club 

705
00:55:35,270 --> 00:55:37,440
 Oh, Bok Joo. Is your training over? 

706
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:41,070
 Then, you should hurry up and go home. Your father...  

707
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:48,570
Father!

708
00:55:49,470 --> 00:55:51,540
Dad!

709
00:55:51,570 --> 00:55:53,190
Dad!

710
00:55:53,190 --> 00:55:55,740
Father! Father!

711
00:55:55,740 --> 00:55:58,350
What the heck? I heard you weren't well. Are you okay?

712
00:55:58,350 --> 00:56:00,390
You're fooled, punk.

713
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:05,150
Your dad put on a show so that he could show you this makeup dresser.

714
00:56:05,150 --> 00:56:07,210
Aish! Uncle, Father!

715
00:56:07,210 --> 00:56:11,270
You said it would be good to have one! This wench said it with her own mouth, what is she saying now?

716
00:56:11,270 --> 00:56:14,670
The design and the color are good.

717
00:56:14,690 --> 00:56:17,880
It looks refined. Is it an expensive one?

718
00:56:19,490 --> 00:56:23,590
Oh, inside of the drawer has a good finish as well. It's good.

719
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:24,740
- You came already, Doctor?
 - Is the patient here?

720
00:57:24,740 --> 00:57:27,510
No, not yet. There is still 10 minutes left.

721
00:57:50,010 --> 00:57:51,700
Somehow...

722
00:57:52,470 --> 00:57:57,350
He became cool and polite after becoming a doctor.

723
00:57:58,090 --> 00:58:02,700
But why is my energy drained?

724
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:06,250
What were you expecting, Kim Bok Joo?

725
00:58:06,250 --> 00:58:07,730
Hey, Weightlifter Kim!

726
00:58:07,730 --> 00:58:11,700
Hey, Kim Bok Joo! Why are you coming now?

727
00:58:11,700 --> 00:58:13,550
Yeah! We can eat a meal now!

728
00:58:13,550 --> 00:58:18,410
Today's menu, Potato stew that you like!

729
00:58:18,410 --> 00:58:23,930
 Hey!
 Wake up from a dream, Kim Bok Joo. He is no less than a doctor. 

730
00:58:23,930 --> 00:58:26,290
 You aren't on the same level as him. 

731
00:58:26,290 --> 00:58:29,030
- Ah, Kim Bok Joo!
 - I'm going!

732
00:58:29,030 --> 00:58:32,240
I'm hungry, come quickly!

733
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:37,590
- I'm really hungry!
 - Hey! We're not kidding.

734
00:58:38,830 --> 00:58:41,530
What are you doing Bok Joo?

735
00:58:41,530 --> 00:58:43,740
- Where are you going? 
- Hey, Kim Bok Joo, where are you going?!

736
00:58:43,740 --> 00:58:45,770
Hey, Kim Bok Joo!

737
00:58:47,050 --> 00:58:51,850
Yes, this is Jae Yi's Weight Clinic. Five o'clock?

738
00:58:51,850 --> 00:58:55,640
Yes, we've confirmed your appointment.

739
00:58:57,300 --> 00:58:59,710
Ms. Kim Bok Joo.

740
00:58:59,710 --> 00:59:01,890
Yes.

741
00:59:05,550 --> 00:59:07,450
Doctor, the next patient will be coming in.

742
00:59:07,450 --> 00:59:11,830
Yes. Kim Bok Joo...

743
00:59:13,150 --> 00:59:17,270
- Oh. You, by any chance...
 - Yes, we met by chance a few weeks ago.

744
00:59:17,270 --> 00:59:21,220
You are, right? Did you get in safely that day?

745
00:59:21,220 --> 00:59:24,020
- Is your arm okay?
 - Yes. it's okay.

746
00:59:24,020 --> 00:59:27,930
Oh, that's a relief. The dresser you were carrying was quite big.

747
00:59:27,930 --> 00:59:30,320
You must be here for counseling.

748
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:32,250
Sit down.

749
00:59:34,750 --> 00:59:39,970
Wow, I guess we do have some kind of connection.

750
00:59:41,890 --> 00:59:44,100
Excuse me, Doctor.

751
00:59:44,130 --> 00:59:49,970


752
00:59:49,970 --> 00:59:54,550
Do you possibly like   Messi  ?  
 (Famous Argentine soccer player) 

753
00:59:54,570 --> 00:59:56,850
Pardon?

754
00:59:56,850 --> 01:00:01,000
Do you like Messi?
