1
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:37,230


2
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:45,480
They don't do the practice that they are supposed to be doing in the sacred school but do dating, aigoo...

3
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,890
How disappointed will their parents be if they find out it?

4
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:51,870
Aigoo, who are their parents?

5
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:00,360
Wear the hood.

6
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,700
You, too.

7
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:07,150
♬  the corners of my lips are pulled up into a chuckle  ♬

8
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:11,480
What are those two doing? Aigoo, aigoo.

9
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:14,080
Why do they act crazy like that in the school?

10
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,360
They're just biting, licking, and loving it to death, seriously.

11
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:19,270
If they want each other like that, they should've lived together, damn!

12
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:21,970
Aihee, they ruined my eyes! They'll fall while acting like that!

13
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:23,950
♬  (I'm) dreaming of your love  ♬

14
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:27,610
 Episode 14:  This woman is my woman.  
♬  What exactly are you doing to me?  ♬

15
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:32,740
♬  Everything seems to be a dream  ♬

16
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:36,570
The interior has changed.

17
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:39,480
Hmm. The pictures are good, aren't they?

18
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:43,310
Those are the presents that I gave to myself for working hard last year.

19
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:46,830
It's been a while since they were here.

20
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:50,930
Yeah, thinking about it, my Joon Hyeong has not been here a while.

21
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:53,710
I'm sorry. I have been busy doing this and that.

22
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:58,620
No, no. It's good that you have something you can indulge in.

23
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:02,460
But I'm curious, what made you so busy?

24
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:07,320
Just... I'm sticking my nose in someone else's life.

25
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,880
It's not really that nutritious  (beneficial) , is it?

26
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:14,150
I think it looks very nutritious.

27
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:19,960
Your expression is very comfortable and bright. I feel something like a very positive energy. Isn't it right?

28
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:24,440
Hmm... That's right. These days, I don't hear any sound in my ears (Tinnitus).

29
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:28,620
I'm guessing carefully...

30
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,470
By any chance, are you dating?

31
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:33,350
Bingo!

32
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:38,480
Indeed, there is no better medicine in healing emotions than dating.

33
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:43,730
Doctor. You're such an excellent doctor. I'm really respecting you.

34
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:48,620
Yea, really! It's good!

35
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:53,290
Is your girlfriend pretty?

36
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:59,890
Ah, just... I'm kind of... better than her.

37
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:05,100
Ahhh, I'll get muscle tightness!

38
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:06,650
What did Nan Hee—

39
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:07,990
Do my feet smell?

40
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:12,640
Really! You two are really weird!

41
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,540
 What time are you eating lunch? 

42
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:17,650
 I'm outside right now. I'm planning on matching my time with yours to go to the lunchroom. 

43
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:21,510
 At 12 pm. 

44
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:27,980
Look at this...

45
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:32,850
There are people who're dating in the sacred weightlifting room!

46
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:35,110
It's not like you're a stray cat or something (very sneaky).

47
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:39,650
Do you think we can't find out it if you sneakily date?

48
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:42,720
Really. honey is dropping from your eyes!

49
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,120
No Hyeong Cheol and Lee Yae Min!

50
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:48,560
Awesome! Did something happen while I wasn't here?

51
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,450
What? Is that true?

52
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:54,690
No wonder! Yae Min overreacted by crying so much when Hyeong Cheol was taken to the medical office.

53
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:58,220
Wow, these two! And here someone else had no feeling in their hands and feet because they were frozen.

54
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:01,530
These two were filming a movie! It's too much, really!

55
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:03,400
Wow, we really feel betrayed!

56
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,550
Ah, these two, from when? What is this?

57
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:08,510
Don't say too much!

58
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:11,650
Even though Yae Min did nothing, I was the one who flirted with her.

59
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:15,790
No, it's not. Oppa is innocent.

60
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:18,570
I'm the one that seduced him first.

61
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:27,410
It's a repeating shock after the incident of Coach and Bok Joo's uncle.

62
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:31,980
Yae Min kept saying she was lonely, but she is finally dating.

63
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:36,080
But Sunbae Hyeong Cheol said Han Yae Seul (actress) was his type not very long ago, didn't he?

64
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,990
I've found that the person you end up dating is different than your ideal type.

65
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:44,000
When I look the people around me.

66
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,880
Anyhow, it must be nice.

67
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,650
I don't know whether it's because of winter time, but there are couples all over the place here.

68
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:54,330
Even yesterday, there was a ridiculous couple who acted crazily over there.

69
00:04:55,080 --> 00:05:00,700
You guys, let's not betray each other first by even the slightest bit! Especially you, Kim Bok Joo.

70
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,480
No way! Impossible! Can Bok Joo do that?

71
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:06,100
She went through such a hard time because of a man not long ago.

72
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:09,210
She will be a crazy wench if she dates again.

73
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:11,710
Of course. I'll be a crazy wench if I date again.

74
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:16,250
Okay. Betraying our sisterhood trio means death.

75
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,440
Sisterhood SWAG!

76
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,220
- Swag!
 - Swag!

77
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:28,940
I think they put too many meatballs in it.

78
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:31,730
- Oh, Fatty!
 - Hello, hello! Hey!

79
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:34,000
Oh, you guys just started eating. We'll just eat with you guys, then.

80
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,690
Should we?

81
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:39,550
Ahh...It's been a while since all three of you gathered together.

82
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:41,420
Soon Ok when did you get back?

83
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:43,750
Yesterday. Good seeing you.

84
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:49,150
I'm sorry.

85
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:18,910
Are my fingers getting fatter? Ah, really...

86
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:25,280
What happened? Are you okay Joon Hyeong?

87
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,920
Are you okay?

88
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:29,670
How did it happen?

89
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:33,760
I think I really got a bruise.

90
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,500
Does it hurt a lot? Do you want to go to the medical office and get a hot message?

91
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,100
Are you giving me the sickness and the cure? ( Causing the problem and then giving the solution) 

92
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:41,110
Then why did you suddenly hold my hand with the others around?

93
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:44,910
So what if the others were there? Did we commit a crime or something?

94
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:46,510
Since we're on the topic let me ask you.

95
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:50,160
I'm really curious about this. Why do we have to date in secret?

96
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,080
Are you a minor or a married woman?

97
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:58,660
Or are you ashamed of  me?

98
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:00,470
It's not that.

99
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:02,160
Then why?

100
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,760
After dating for a short time, do you want to return me if I'm not right? Are you ashamed of me? Testing me?

101
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,610
Why are you talking like that?

102
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:12,920
If I tell them about it right now, I'll be named as a traitorous wench.

103
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:17,570
I acted like I won't look at a man again after the incident with Doctor. I may look like a crazy wench!

104
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:20,470
Originally, people forget people with other people.

105
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:21,880
Ah, those kids don't know anything.

106
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:25,140
Anyway now is not the time, I'm sure of that.

107
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:31,660
Let's keep it a secret for the time being and find a time to tell them slowly.

108
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:39,810
What are you doing? Is this you acting charming?

109
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:42,230
If you don't want to, then forget it.

110
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:46,690
Hey, do that one more time. Then I will seriously, positively think about it.

111
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:55,580
I can't do it. Just tell them. Tell!

112
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:58,940
Just do it one more time. It's just so fascinating to me.

113
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:02,230
- Do it one more time, just once. 
  - What?

114
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:05,410
Acting cute. Do it one more time, like you just did.

115
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:06,650
What did you say? I can't  hear you.

116
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:11,700
Do it one more time. It's really fascinating to me. Just one more time.

117
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:15,700
Do it once more for me. Just once more.

118
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,340
One more time.

119
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:23,260
You startled me. I'm shocked.

120
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:26,530
- Are you getting off now? 
 - Yes.

121
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:28,970
I would have missed you if I had come just a little bit later.

122
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:31,590
What are doing here without calling?

123
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:37,620
I just happened to have two concert tickets for the violinist whom you said you liked after listening to my CD last time.

124
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:42,380
He came to Korea. If your schedule allows, I want to go there with you.

125
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:46,540
Jae Yi. I'm actually not really that interested in classical music.

126
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:52,470
I just pretended to like it because you like it. I don't even remember who that violinist is.

127
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:58,280
Let's go eat. Food isn't something you eat because of me.

128
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:19,410
You aren't saying you like steak even though you don't, right?

129
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:21,870
No, I really do like steak.

130
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:25,070
Thank goodness.

131
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:26,720
Hurry up and eat. Eat up.

132
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:32,960
♬   What a difference a day made   ♬

133
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:38,070
Ah Yeong, what are you doing this weekend?

134
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:43,740
If you don't have any plans, then let's meet up and do something you want to do instead of doing what I want to do.

135
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:49,060
That's enough, Jeong Jae Yi. I'll sleep like a dead person on the weekend. These days, I'm tired.

136
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:52,960
Then should I go to your house? I'll make spaghetti.

137
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:57,140
Get some sleep then wake up to eat the food I make for you. Then you can sleep again afterward.

138
00:09:57,140 --> 00:10:01,420
Jae Yi, don't try so hard.

139
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:05,430
Couldn't trying hard also become a start for us?

140
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:11,170
No. Do you think that trying hard will make you start having feelings toward me that you haven't felt for ten whole years?

141
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:14,920
People's hearts don't change just because you work hard. I know because I've tried it for so long.

142
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:18,880
♬  My lonely nights are through, Dear   ♬

143
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:28,280
♬    Since you said you were mine  ♬

144
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:36,260
Ah, you guys, seriously. If you're going to come to my room so often, you should just ask to have your room changed!

145
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,440
Strangely, I can remove calluses well in your room.

146
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:41,840
Me too. For some strange reason, I find your room is more comfortable.

147
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:45,280
- What is that? Potato?
  - Yeah.

148
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:48,810
Please don't eat it. Please give it up to the skin.

149
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:52,500
It's Nan Hee's special face pack made of flour, potatoes, and honey mixed together.

150
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:56,430
This works wonders on moisturizing and whitening your skin.

151
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:03,650
What do you think? It looks really nice and moist, doesn't it?

152
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:06,580
Yeah. Wow, you look like steamed white rice cake!

153
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:08,440
Hey, you want to give it a try?

154
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:12,370
I don't know. I've never tried it before. Shall I try it once just for fun?

155
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:14,640
Let's do it. I'll do it for you.

156
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:23,340
Wow, what's up with you, Bok Joo? You were never interested in stuff like face packs before.

157
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:25,770
There are times when Bok Joo goes through changes, too.

158
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:31,130
If your face becomes all moist and shiny after I put this pack on it, then you're going to go to the cafeteria and buy me a pack of sausage. Okay?

159
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:33,430
Hey, make sure you line it up right.

160
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:36,810
Leave it on there for twenty minutes and take it off, okay? Don't fall asleep with it on.

161
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:39,040
- Hello.
- Hey.

162
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,910
- This is so tiresome. How can you do it every day?
- How long? How many minutes?

163
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:44,410
- Twenty minutes, twenty minutes. Aigoo, keep a good hold on it!
- I'll hold it down for you.

164
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:49,050
- You have to hold it right.
 - Do you really do this 4 times a week?

165
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,880
What is this, seriously?!

166
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:59,020
I guess that you went back to puberty since you couldn't get a baby face.

167
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,800
Why are you getting a huge pimple when you're already twenty years old?

168
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,700
Hey, isn't it a side effect of that face pack from yesterday?

169
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,800
That's weird. I've never had any side effects even after doing it a hundred days in a row.

170
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,190
You told me not to eat the potato! You told me to give it up to my skin!

171
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:12,990
Hey, by any chance, did you leave the pack on your face while you slept?

172
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:15,090
Did you really take it off after 20 minutes?

173
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:19,520
Well, I did fall asleep a little and then took it off early in the morning.

174
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:23,320
That's why that happened! You have to use packs properly for them to have a good effect.

175
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:26,740
Leaving it for a long makes you worse than not doing at all, you're so frustrating!

176
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:31,210
Ah, what should I do? What am I going to do about this today?

177
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:36,090
What's the big deal? It's not like you've got a boyfriend that you've got to look pretty for. Just deal with it for a few days.

178
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:41,790
Hey, but when you look at it, it does kind of feel like it popped up because you didn't wash your face.

179
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:45,390
Look at that pimple. So dirty!

180
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,440
- Let's go!
 - Fighting!

181
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:52,300
- Hello!
 - Hello!

182
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:54,980
Hello!

183
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:57,280
Bok Joo!

184
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:02,780
- Hey, did you catch a cold?
 - Yeah.

185
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:05,580
Is it bad?

186
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:10,310
Hey, I'll call you later!

187
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:18,660
Hey, you were perfectly fine just yesterday. Are you really sick?

188
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:24,610
Yeah. A little. I suddenly started coughing and even got a fever last night.

189
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:26,920
I am having a pretty hard time.

190
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:31,660
What should we do when you're that sick? Shouldn't you go to a doctor?

191
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:36,080
Well, my cold is the kind that will get better

192
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:39,280
if I just cover myself with a blanket and get some good rest.

193
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:42,400
So I'll have to just rough it through training and then hurry up to go get some rest.

194
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:48,420
I don't think I'll be able to see you today because I'm in this condition.

195
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:53,670
I understand. Don't work yourself too hard. I'll call you again.

196
00:13:57,350 --> 00:14:01,880
Aish, I'm throwing such a ridiculous show because of this stupid huge pimple. I wish it would just die.

197
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:09,020
Ah, Bok Joo. Woah!

198
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:12,330
You've got a really folksy atmosphere around you.

199
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:15,360
Only a pimple makes you look like a stupid, huh?

200
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:21,320
Hey, Rhino. Won't you look the other way or something?

201
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:25,380
You look so funny that I won't be able to train!

202
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:31,050
Ah, it looks so ugly! I thought of a way to pop it.

203
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:34,750
If you eat a lot of greasy  stuff, then it'll ripen. Then you can just pop it.

204
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:37,770
Yeah, that sounds plausible. Or should I touch it with my dirty hands?

205
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:39,430
Ah, you guys are so annoying! Go away!

206
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:42,060
Hey, maybe if I put some chalk on it...

207
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:43,510
- So funny!
 - I said, go away.

208
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:46,040
Ah, seriously!

209
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:48,660
You're so devoted, my son.

210
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:52,300
Wait, who caught a cold for you to be taking them this medicine?

211
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:54,250
There's a close friend of mine.

212
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:56,580
- You know this is expensive medicine, right?
- Of course.

213
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:59,850
I picked this out personally to give to you.

214
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:02,780
- Tell them not to throw away even one bit of it.
 - Yes, ma'am. Thank you.

215
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:08,660
You're just going to thank me with your mouth? You've been showing me less physical affection these days.

216
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:11,430
Ah, look at you putting me on blast again, Mom!

217
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:18,620
- Get the rest of them from Dad. I'm going.
 - Okay, go on.

218
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:23,740
Such a cutie pie.

219
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:36,330
I passed up going to the lunchroom just because I was scared I'd run into Joon Hyeong. What the heck is this?

220
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:37,970
Ah, seriously!

221
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:44,000
Oh, Joon Hyeong.

222
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,640
Hey, your voice sounds even worse. Where are you? In your room?

223
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:50,620
Yeah, that's right. I'm in my room.

224
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:54,720
Then will you come down to the lobby for a minute? I went home to bring you some medicine.

225
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,690
Oh, no! No, no, no! No.

226
00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:01,770
 No, I don't think I'll be able to go. 

227
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:06,160
Because I coughed too much, I don't have any strength in my legs.

228
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:13,920
And I can't give my cold to you. You're a swimmer.

229
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,170
I don't care about that, though.

230
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:19,520
What do you expect me to do when you're that sick? Can't you come out for just a second?

231
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:24,250
No, I'm really sleepy. I think I need to get some sleep.

232
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:27,840
I got it.

233
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:30,160
Sleep, then. I'll call you again.

234
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,420
Okay. I'm hanging up.

235
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:39,360
Ah, why did he go all the way home? He's making me feel so bad.

236
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:43,960
Ah, it seems like it's getting worse and worse.

237
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:47,510
It would be better if she took some medicine before she went to sleep.

238
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:03,190
Ah, can I squeeze this? I don't think it ripened yet.

239
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:06,450
Won't I die from excessive bleeding if I squeeze it?

240
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:12,450
This hurts so much! What should I do, seriously? Ah, I don't care.

241
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,750
Hey!

242
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:46,350
You're going to drive me crazy, Kim Bok Joo.

243
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:48,850
What's so bad about a little pimple that you would even tell lies because of it?

244
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:51,720
I didn't even know that's what was going on and was really worried about you.

245
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:55,610
I even went home and bought special medicine that my mom made herself.

246
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:58,190
- Sorry.
 - Jeez.

247
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:02,210
But now that I look at it closely, it does look funny.

248
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:05,590
I've already seen it, so why are you covering it? Just let it out in the open.

249
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:08,830
I don't want to. It's really embarrassing.

250
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:12,620
Ah, the more I look at you, the more I realize that you're a true woman, Kim Bok Joo.

251
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,480
You've got some unexpected charms.

252
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,920
But that pimple does have some good results.

253
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:23,380
Thanks to it, I got to come all the way to your room.

254
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:28,950
Woah, a woman's room has a different feel than my room.

255
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:30,860
It's got girly stuff in it, too.

256
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:33,130
That's your ex-girlfriend's.

257
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:39,380
No wonder. It's no wonder that it didn't fit my taste.

258
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:43,080
Is this where the closet is?

259
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:47,160
Hey, hey! You can't look in there. You really can't. No, no, no.

260
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:50,920
- What do you mean, I can't? I don't usually clean mine either.
- No, you can't, you can't!

261
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:53,610
- No, no, no!
- Hey, hey, hey!

262
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:06,190
Why are you doing this? You can't.

263
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:10,450
Can't do what? I didn't do anything.

264
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:24,820
♬  I dream of it.  Please let us be eternally happy  ♬

265
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:31,130
♬  I dream of it Please let us have youthful days  ♬

266
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:34,910
Miss Bok Joo, you've got a delivery for a family-sized super supreme pizza!

267
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:37,510
Bok Joo, we're coming in!

268
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:41,800
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, I was changing my clothes and doing some stretching.

269
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,830
- Hey, you're hungry, aren't you? Let's hurry up and spread it out.
- Hey, what are you doing?

270
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:46,590
Hey, I only ate one slice so that you could eat some too. Let's hurry up and eat it.

271
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:50,920
Hey, go to the lounge and eat it. This isn't a room that I use only myself. You can't make it filled with an odor.

272
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:53,790
Those chopsticks (gymnasts) are in the lounge right now. We'll just air out the room afterward.

273
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:56,420
- What is she saying? 
- Ah, seriously!

274
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:59,290
Wait, wait! Sit here! Lee Soon Ok!

275
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:04,560
- Sit here. You're getting my blankets dirty. I just cleaned them.
 - Ah, seriously.

276
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,710
- Aigoo.
- What's up with you?

277
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:09,830
- Ah, let's eat pizza.
- Pizza, pizza!

278
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:16,090
- Really. 
- That's mine.

279
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,720
You came by intending this.

280
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:46,860
Hey, are you not going to drink? Your appetite is smaller than usual.

281
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:52,740
I know. You're someone who would usually eat two boxes. What's with you today? Ah, is it because of the pimple?

282
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:54,530
I just don't feel good.

283
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:56,990
You can't digest? Drink some coke, here.

284
00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:00,920
You too.

285
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:06,490
Ah, it tastes good.

286
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:08,820
What are you doing?!

287
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:15,470
Huh? You're eating pizza, how could you burp in front of food? Disgusting.

288
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:18,090
Who cares? It's just us. I thought something bad had happened.

289
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:20,920
You burp all the time whenever and wherever, what's with you suddenly?

290
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:23,440
Hey, when did I e-ever?!

291
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:27,450
That's not all. You said you'd sweat anyhow, after walking, so you didn't wash your hair.

292
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:31,230
Exactly. You just wash only the front part of your hair like this because you don't want to wash your whole head.

293
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:36,030
When did I ever? Hurry up and leave! Eat in your room!

294
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:37,410
Hello.

295
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:39,410
We'll finish eating quickly and ventilate the room.

296
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:42,420
It's fine. I don't mind so take your time eating.

297
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:53,920
Goodness...

298
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:09,110
Um, I'm sorry but I'm suddenly tired.

299
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:10,700
Could you finish up quickly?

300
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:12,300
Suddenly?

301
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:13,720
Just a few seconds ago, she said it was fine.

302
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:16,310
You change your mind so quickly.

303
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:19,380
We're leaving.

304
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:20,950
"Suddenly"...

305
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:25,250
Yeah, goodbye. Sorry about this.

306
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:30,610
What is this, seriously? Come out.

307
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:40,850
Wow, the night-view is killer. So the night view here is better. I should have come up here sooner.

308
00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:44,860
Hey, I guess my college life was  really  lacking. There are so many things I never knew.

309
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:49,730
Since you know them now, it's fine. Thanks for earlier.

310
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:53,370
Thanks, Unnie. Ta-dah!

311
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:55,490
Do you guys hide your drinks there?

312
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:59,500
Since you gave it to me with a gesture of kindness, just one sip.

313
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:06,990
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

314
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:18,040
Wow, this is delicious but my competition is right around the corner so I  just finished this with one sip.

315
00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:23,100
Compared to rhythmic gymnastics, weightlifting and swimming are happy sports.

316
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:26,090
Ugh! I can't live while managing my weight like that, I can't. Never!

317
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:29,720
Why? You did gain weight, which is even harder. That's even more amazing.

318
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:33,070
Ugh, what's wrong with you two? Seriously, I can't adjust to this kind of atmosphere.

319
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:36,860
What? I was way closer to her before I was close to you!

320
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:40,760
Unnie, you have a competition soon, right? When is it? Joon Hyeong and I will go to support you.

321
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,160
This weekend.

322
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,340
Let's go. Let's go support her, come on.

323
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:45,070
Hey, how can we go?

324
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:46,690
It'd be great to go support her, right?

325
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:47,730
How could we go?

326
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:49,340
What's wrong with it? Unnie, wouldn't that be great?

327
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:53,810
Ah, I guess I'll have to leave first. I think I was clueless and stayed here for too long.

328
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:56,860
Don't come back too late, okay? Bye.

329
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:59,160
- Goodbye, Unni.
 - Yep.

330
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:02,390
Si Ho, are you not going to take your can with you?

331
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:09,120
I even hid in a closet because of someone named Kim Bok Joo.

332
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,650
Seriously, today was quite chaotic, wasn't it?

333
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,950
Hey, did you skip washing your hair today too?

334
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:22,930
Hey, that was just because I had a hard time from my additional practice! I usually wash my hair regularly and really well!

335
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:24,700
Fine, we'll just say you do.

336
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:27,170
It's not "we'll just say you do." I usually do!

337
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:29,070
Fine.

338
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:33,550
But until when do we have to put on this show?

339
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:37,440
Let's keep it a secret until the new semester starts.

340
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:42,840
Especially your best friend, that comrade Tae Gwon, He's really a black sheep. Be careful, huh?

341
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:45,310
He's nice on his own way. Are you looking down on my friend? 
♬   Will you be spinning in delight?   ♬

342
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:46,560
I'm just telling you to be careful.

343
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,530
I'm always careful. 
♬   I think   ♬

344
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:49,690
Are you getting irritated with me right now? 
♬   you're so pretty   ♬

345
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:52,700
- I wasn't getting irritated. I was just telling you to be careful.
 - At this rate, you'll hit me soon. 
♬   However  

346
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:56,750
How could I hit you? You're so lovable. 
 ♬  both the confession and regret    ♬

347
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:59,590
♬   that follows   ♬

348
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:04,420
What are you doing?! Don't say those kinds of things! It's so cute!
 ♬  are awkward   ♬

349
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:12,420
♬   but we each have big and little concerns worrying us   ♬

350
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:17,400

351
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:22,300
♬   Following the rainbow that comes after the rain   ♬

352
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:28,140
♬   amazing days are waiting for us   ♬

353
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:32,600
♬   When it gets hard from now on,  ♬

354
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:39,990
♬   who cares if I give up? I can just walk two steps forward tomorrow   ♬

355
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:51,200
 Finished with training? 

356
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:55,750
 Just finished. I'll call you on my way out. 

357
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,130
Joon Hyeong! Joon Hyeong! Jeong Joon Hyeong!

358
00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:07,040
What? What is it?

359
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,990
Hey, emergency, emergency, emergency! Come with me for a minute, quickly!

360
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:12,020
Hey, what? Where are we going?

361
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:14,070
First, come on. I'll tell you after we get there, come on.

362
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:16,530
Hurry! Hurry!

363
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,860
Hey, hey, hey! Where are you going?

364
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:21,090
What kind of play are you trying to set up?!

365
00:26:21,090 --> 00:26:25,040
Hey, she suddenly called me. She said she was in front of our school and if we could come out for just a minute.

366
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:27,790
She told me to make sure to bring you, YOU.

367
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:32,830
You left last time, like someone without manners. Do you know how upset So Hye was back then?

368
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:34,640
So if you didn't come out today, would she be upset or not?

369
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,820
Seriously, if you do this...

370
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:38,480
You can't do this!

371
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:42,350
Hey, you rascal! They're pretty so how can I just send them away? How can I do that, huh?!

372
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:49,860
Hi! Wow, both of you have gotten prettier.

373
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:52,000
- You're here. 
 - It's been a while.

374
00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:53,920
Yes, hello.

375
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:57,380
Did you eat? Did you already order?

376
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:59,080
It's the handsome guy from the Swimming Department.

377
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,210
Oppa!

378
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:01,600
Not yet? What would you like to order?

379
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,480
- I'd like an Americano.
- I'd like an Americano as well.

380
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:06,360
Yes, I'll order and come right back.

381
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:17,930
What? He said he would call me on his way out but he's not even calling me.

382
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:23,050
- Senior, hello.
 - Hey,

383
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:25,340
Where did your boyfriend go?

384
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:29,470
Ah, he went to the bathroom. He'll be right back.

385
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:36,660
By the way, senior, you know that swimmer who wrapped a scarf around you and gave you a coat?

386
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:38,190
Ah, Joon Hyeong?

387
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:43,980
I guess you two are really just friends. I thought that you two were flirting with each other,

388
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:46,940
but he's having a blind date in the cafe in front of our school.

389
00:27:50,330 --> 00:27:53,180
B-Blind dating?

390
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:54,730
Yes...

391
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:57,920
Where?

392
00:27:58,550 --> 00:28:02,990
Athlete Kim! I'm starving so why are you making such a huge fuss about drinking coffee?!

393
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:09,050
You don't even like coffee! If you're going to eat, just eat anything! Why are you going around searching for coffee?!

394
00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:10,850
Coffee is all the same.

395
00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:13,570
This won't do. I have to at least eat some spicy rice cakes here.

396
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:16,110
Ah, I'm hungry.

397
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:20,210
Isn't that Comrade Tae Gwon and Jeong Joon Hyeong?

398
00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:21,910
Where, where, where?

399
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:26,570
It is! From the looks of it, they're on a blind date.

400
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:30,710
What is that? They're not even that pretty. We're much better! Let's leave.

401
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:35,560
Let's at least  sight-see here before we leave. I think this cafe's coffee will be really delicious.

402
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:39,040
Let's go and see.

403
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:50,320
First stage? You said you were good at handling spicy food.

404
00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:58,680
Hey, hey, hey. Look while eating. There is a saying, "A loaf of bread is better than the song of many birds."

405
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:02,220
Yeah, Bok Joo. You have a mouth to eat and eyes to see.

406
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:08,190
Looking at how those girls dressed up so much, they're planning on succeeding today.

407
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:12,920
That fox-like girl over there, I bet my hand that she has her dibs on Jeong Joon Hyeong.

408
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:17,360
Hey, I'm terrible at guessing but even I can see that. Ugh, look at her eye smile.

409
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:20,290
Hey, she's even touching him slyly while she talks!

410
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:29,410
You die. I kill you! Finish within 5 minutes.

411
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:35,090
You two, you two, you two.

412
00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:38,840
He really likes it.

413
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:41,780
The best rank, the best one, while sweat rolls down.

414
00:29:56,230 --> 00:30:01,900
Hey, Tae Gwon. I think we'll have to leave now.

415
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:05,740
There has just been an emergency call for our grade.

416
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:09,760
What do you mean? I'm the head of the second year and no one said anything.

417
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,800
No. I'm telling you, I just saw it.

418
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,150
Stop talking nonsense.

419
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:19,300
Hey! We don't have much time left before our competition so we need to go and practice!

420
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:23,960
Hey, I was already eliminated from that competition anyway because I was terrible in the last meet.

421
00:30:24,770 --> 00:30:30,060
This bastard here is boasting about himself. Although he has some problems with starting, he's our Swimming department's ace.

422
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:34,890
Oh, that's why. His figure was like Michael Phelps'.

423
00:30:34,890 --> 00:30:37,510
Your shoulders are no joke.

424
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:39,500
Why are you doing this to me?

425
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:45,430
Come on, your shoulders are really broad.. His shoulders are really broad.

426
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:57,790
Remove that dirty hand, right now.

427
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,580
Bok Joo!

428
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,330
Who are you?

429
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:06,810
I'm the girlfriend of the guy that you were just pawing, why?!

430
00:31:06,810 --> 00:31:08,360
   ♬ What?! 

431
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:27,710
Wow, I'm really speechless.

432
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:30,910
I feel so betrayed, Kim Bok Joo.

433
00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:34,680
How did this happen? Since when did you...

434
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,690
No way. Was it ever since we went to the amusement park that time?

435
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:39,420
No, we weren't in that kind of relationship back then.

436
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:41,690
I liked her by myself at that time.

437
00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:43,200
What?

438
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:53,060
So, exactly how long has it been? Since yesterday? Last week? The week before last?

439
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:56,240
From the day that I came back to weightlifting.

440
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:01,540
Then that day that we did the hunger strike when he brought the clothes and the scarf?

441
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:06,800
So that's what it was. And here I was without a clue. I was even envious and said I wouldn't wish for anything else if I had a boyfriend like that.

442
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:11,000
Ah, no wonder. Your facial expression was different than usual back then.

443
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:16,260
Then why the heck didn't you tell us, again? You had plenty of time to tell us the truth.

444
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:21,780
I didn't want you guys to view me as a betrayer. And it hasn't been that long since I was going crazy because of another man.

445
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:26,500
We were just saying you were a betrayer. So that's why you dated secretly?

446
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:31,510
Now that I look at you, you're totally sneaky, Bok Joo. You're really a habitual liar.

447
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:36,290
Hey, that's not right! You guys always pressure her so much that Bok Joo had no choice but to—

448
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:41,840
Excuse me. It seems like you're taking her side because you're her boyfriend right now, but you should discern the mood right now!

449
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:45,020
Yes, ma'am.

450
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:48,430
Anyway, I'm really sorry for not telling you guys.

451
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:49,540
Do you think everything's better just because you said sorry?

452
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:51,680
You're saying you'll just handle it with words?

453
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,960
Then?

454
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:56,910
You should pay the price for your sins, Mr. Bok Joo's Boyfriend.

455
00:32:56,910 --> 00:32:58,090
Shall we call it a type of hazing ritual?

456
00:32:58,090 --> 00:33:00,980
H-Hazing ritual?

457
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:03,380
Hey, what is it? Am I going to get hit?

458
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:05,940
You should treat us since you've taken Bok Joo.

459
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:08,120
Of course! Let's use this chance to go get meat!

460
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,790
Ah, meat! Meat.

461
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:15,990
Then will you stop being mad if I buy you meat?

462
00:33:15,990 --> 00:33:20,580
Then will we be able to date comfortably, too?

463
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:23,060
Not meat.

464
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:37,800
Let's hurry up and go home, Coach Choi. I'm really tired today.

465
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:42,800
Professor, do you want to have a drink with me if you don't have any plans today?

466
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:45,920
Can't we do it next time? I'm really tired today.

467
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:50,570
No, we can't! We have to do it today.

468
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:56,120
Alright, then. Let's go. Aigoo.

469
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:03,750
Oh, you scared me!

470
00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:09,900
Aigoo, I came right on time. I came because I thought it was around the time you got off work.

471
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:11,630
I'll take you home.

472
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:15,500
Ah, that's... I have something to discuss with the professor today.

473
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:21,830
Ah, ah. Are you planning on having a drink? That's good, then! I wanted to have a drink with Professor, too.

474
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:24,490
I'll just have to go and have some snacks with the drink and then take you home.

475
00:34:24,490 --> 00:34:28,320
Look, Bok Joo's Uncle... Kim Dae Ho—

476
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:31,260
Coach Choi, I'll leave first. I'm heading out.

477
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:34,650
You can't, Professor! I have to say it today.

478
00:34:34,650 --> 00:34:39,730
Wh-Why are you acting like this, Seong Eun? Today isn't the only day there is. Professor said that he would leave.

479
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:40,680
Ah, that's...

480
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:43,150
Hey, let's talk next time. I'll get going.

481
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:46,750
Ah, wait! Ah, seriously!

482
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:50,800
Bok Joo's Uncle! Why are you acting like this?

483
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,670
What did I do that was so wrong?

484
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:56,650
Ah, seriously!

485
00:34:56,650 --> 00:34:58,410
 Ahh, aigoo! What shall I do? 

486
00:34:58,410 --> 00:35:00,020
Professor?

487
00:35:03,330 --> 00:35:05,710
We're here, Professor. We're here.

488
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:07,200
- Ah, yes.
- Be careful. Careful.

489
00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:11,350
Oh no, what should we do?

490
00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:14,910
Okay, go slowly. Go slowly.

491
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:16,960
- You did a good job. 
-  Where is a light switch?

492
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,550
Wait for a moment.

493
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:20,550
The lights, the lights!

494
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:21,600
Be gentle, be gentle!

495
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,970
Gently, gently! Be gentle.

496
00:35:22,970 --> 00:35:26,220
Yes. Go slowly, one step at a time.

497
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:27,370
You're okay, right?

498
00:35:27,370 --> 00:35:28,760
Okay?

499
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,390
Ah, what should we do?

500
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:33,150
Your house... The smell...

501
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:36,680
Ah, wait a second. Wait just a second.

502
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:42,350
Here. Hold on.

503
00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:45,620
- Ow!
 - Is that good?

504
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:48,060
Ah, I feel like I'm going to die.

505
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:49,920
Ah, seriously!

506
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:56,030
What should we do? If the pain medication effect wears off, then it'll hurt even more. It's so upsetting, really.

507
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:59,960
Hey, it's okay. It's not like it's broken or something.

508
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:03,450
It'll probably get better if I just rest until the weekend.

509
00:36:03,450 --> 00:36:06,800
Ah, why of all things do you have a hairline fracture in the tailbone?

510
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:12,210
This won't do. It'll be hard for you to rest and to eat when  you need to take your medication

511
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:14,330
I'll come back after I go grocery shopping tomorrow.

512
00:36:14,330 --> 00:36:16,660
You can't! You really can't!

513
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:22,060
What I mean is, rumors could spread around the neighborhood if a woman comes in and out

514
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:25,290
of the house of a man who lives alone.

515
00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:27,390
Either way, you can't do it. I absolutely oppose it.

516
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:31,910
Then what should I do? Professor lives alone and wouldn't be able to even pour himself a glass of water.

517
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:41,410
I got it. Then I'll do it. I'm saying that I'll take care of him.

518
00:36:41,410 --> 00:36:46,190
I'll go grocery shopping, cook porridge, and help him use the restroom.

519
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:51,190
No, that's not it. I'll just have to sleep here. So you don't worry about it and leave, quickly.

520
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:52,540
I'll take care of it.

521
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:54,410
Ah, really.

522
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:03,930
Ah, I can't eat it quickly because it's so hot.

523
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:07,410
Auntie, please give us two more servings of seasoned meat!

524
00:37:07,410 --> 00:37:08,890
Oh, Nan Hee! You're going to a good pace today.

525
00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:11,410
I was really hungry because I only had bread.

526
00:37:11,410 --> 00:37:15,210
As expected, meat tastes the best when other people pay for it.

527
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,890
Thank you.

528
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:23,320
Hey, you guys. Make sure you chew it up. Don't just gulp it down.

529
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:25,460
It's okay! Don't you know that we've got stomachs of steel?

530
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:26,710
Hey, stomachs of steel!

531
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:27,890
Swag!

532
00:37:27,890 --> 00:37:30,750
Hey, isn't the seasoned meat too salty? You should eat it with rice. Should I order you some rice?

533
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:32,840
Hey, why are you acting like such an amateur?

534
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:36,580
Hey, you should eat the rice separately. In the RSFC (Raw, Seasoned, Fried, Cold) order.

535
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:39,620
RSFC? What menu is that?

536
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:44,240
Raw meat, seasoned meat, fried rice, and cold noodles. The basic course at a BBQ restaurant!

537
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:49,860
I've never tried it, but my appetite for meat is suddenly waking up again from watching you two eat.

538
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:51,430
- Then you have some, too. 
 - Get some, get some.

539
00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:54,900
Deal! Auntie, please add two servings of seasoned meat here, please!

540
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:56,990
Hey, what? Why?

541
00:37:56,990 --> 00:38:00,800
Ah, so Bok Joo's boyfriend is giving you hints right now?

542
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:04,970
Let's stop eating. Bok Joo's been throwing us hints since earlier, too.

543
00:38:04,970 --> 00:38:08,220
Wh-When did I ever? Eat up! Eat, eat.

544
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:13,160
That's right. Eat as much as you want. When else would you eat like this if not on a day like today?

545
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:19,610
If you stuff your face with unseasoned meat and then seasoned meat like that, when the heck are you planning to eat the fried rice and cold noodles?

546
00:38:19,610 --> 00:38:20,800
We enjoyed the food!

547
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,350
Oh, that was so good!

548
00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:27,940
Excuse me, Boss. How much is it?

549
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:32,030
$128.

550
00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:33,820
$128?

551
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:35,290
Yes.

552
00:38:37,870 --> 00:38:40,580
Wait, I'll pay it with this.

553
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:49,100
Did you change your phone? It's a new color.

554
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:50,200
It cost a lot, didn't it?

555
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:53,900
No. It didn't cost more than half of my month's allowance.

556
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:57,650
What should we do? You should have dodged them by saying that you'd pay next time.

557
00:38:57,650 --> 00:39:02,620
No, I had to do it at some point anyway. I'll just think that the time was today.

558
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:05,970
When you eat with professionals, it's definitely systematic and nice!

559
00:39:05,970 --> 00:39:07,930
I think I ate twice as much as I usually do!

560
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:09,300
Right? That's how you do it.

561
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:11,930
Hey, Bok Joo! Where should we go for the second round? The noraebang?

562
00:39:11,930 --> 00:39:13,090
- The noraebang?
 -The noraebang?

563
00:39:13,090 --> 00:39:17,920
Hey! Aren't you guys being too much? What do you mean by a second round when you shoveled down that much meat?!

564
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,500
Noraebang!  Noraebang!

565
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:23,130
What do you mean, the noraebang?

566
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:29,670
- Jeong Joon Hyeong! Jeong Joon Hyeong! Noraebang Jeong Joon Hyeong!

567
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:31,490
Noraebang! Jeong Joon Hyung! We'll be on our way!

568
00:39:31,490 --> 00:39:33,330
Hey, let's go!

569
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:44,830
  Jae Yi, I'm going back home. 

570
00:39:44,830 --> 00:39:48,530
  I decided to work at my father's hospital for a while. 

571
00:39:48,530 --> 00:39:51,480
  I had thought about telling you  this personally  but I was afraid I'd have any lingering feelings to you. 

572
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:54,240
  Stay healthy. 

573
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:23,890
  The person you are trying to reach is not available at the moment— 

574
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:47,970
Ah, you sang well.

575
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,290
- It was fun.
 - By the way,

576
00:40:49,290 --> 00:40:52,930
didn't Bok Joo's boyfriend spend too much money? After playing everything, I feel slightly sorry.

577
00:40:52,930 --> 00:40:54,890
- No, no, no. 
 - Really?

578
00:40:54,890 --> 00:40:57,420
- Hey, then we'll treat you all next time.
 - No, no, no!

579
00:40:57,420 --> 00:40:59,700
Next time, I'll treat you all.

580
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:02,770
- RSFC, swag!
 - Swag!

581
00:41:02,770 --> 00:41:05,570
Goodbye, goodbye. Let's go.

582
00:41:05,570 --> 00:41:07,740
What are you doing? Are you not going to come?

583
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:09,540
Huh?

584
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:14,140
Ah, yeah. I have to go in, of course, but after I talk to Joon Hyeong for a bit—

585
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:15,810
It's almost our curfew! We have to leave, come on!

586
00:41:15,810 --> 00:41:18,160
Let's go, let's go!

587
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:20,050
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

588
00:41:20,050 --> 00:41:22,040
Come here!

589
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:24,780
Let's go! I said, let's go! Come on!

590
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:27,380
- Bok Joo, let me go!
 - Come on!

591
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:29,680
Hey, let's meet in our dreams!

592
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:32,600
Let's meet in our dreams, Bok Joo!

593
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:38,110
Hey!

594
00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:44,910
- Wait.
 - Where do you think you're going?

595
00:41:44,910 --> 00:41:49,160
Where are you going, Kim Bok Joo? We have so many questions we never got to ask before  because there were too many people.

596
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:51,020
I think you'll have to sleep in our room tonight.

597
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:54,240
You sneaky thing, you won't sleep tonight. Come on, let's go.

598
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:56,060
What?

599
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:04,230
Tell me. How far did you two go?

600
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:08,470
What do you mean "how far"? I don't understand your question.

601
00:42:08,470 --> 00:42:11,190
Ah, she's pretending not to know after she set everything up.

602
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:13,550
Hey, speak up while we're still being nice.

603
00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:16,600
Athlete Jeong asked how far you two went.

604
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:20,420
How far we went is...

605
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:27,050
- We went to the movies, and we went outside too. 
 - Aish!

606
00:42:27,050 --> 00:42:30,410
You two kissed, right?

607
00:42:30,410 --> 00:42:33,370
There's no way you wouldn't have.

608
00:42:33,370 --> 00:42:35,220
That's my privacy! No comment.

609
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:38,540
You did, you did, you did it!

610
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:42,830
I seriously can't imagine it. Kim Bok Joo and Jeong Joon Hyeong kissed!

611
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:48,000
Ah, I'm so envious. I really don't want to admit it but I'm really envious!

612
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:53,510
When did you kiss? Where? In what situation? Tell us in detail.

613
00:43:00,410 --> 00:43:03,560
The first one or the second one?

614
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:05,410
- What are you even saying?
 - Come on!

615
00:43:05,410 --> 00:43:07,000
- Seriously!
 - You were the one that asked!

616
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,700
- You're boasting about it now, aren't you?!
 - Lucky!

617
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:13,650
- I want to do it too!
 - Goodness!

618
00:43:13,650 --> 00:43:16,170
Get yourself together, you bastard!

619
00:43:16,170 --> 00:43:19,430
Hey, this is self-terror. You shouldn't live your life like that.

620
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:22,300
What? What's wrong with Bok Joo?

621
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:25,530
Of course, I love our mercenary as a human,

622
00:43:25,530 --> 00:43:30,190
but liking someone as a human and liking someone as your girlfriend are completely different things!

623
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:34,900
More importantly, she eats so much!

624
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:37,960
- She's too strong too!
 - What's wrong with that?

625
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:42,020
I find her even sexier because of that.

626
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:46,180
Sexy?! Wow, I'm going insane. The game has already ended.

627
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:50,780
Hey, she seduced you so well. Seriously...

628
00:43:54,850 --> 00:44:01,620


629
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:08,390
Unni, you have your competition today, right? How is your condition?

630
00:44:08,390 --> 00:44:11,050
It's fine.

631
00:44:11,050 --> 00:44:13,400
To be honest, I'm not fine.

632
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:16,720
I've done countless competitions ever since I was young

633
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:19,360
but I think I'm the most nervous today.

634
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:22,950
By any chance, do you have some time?

635
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:31,040
Ah, this isn't a place I reveal to anyone. I'm only revealing this to you because today is a special day.

636
00:44:35,180 --> 00:44:37,600
Make a wish.

637
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:39,870
- Will my wish actually come true?
 - Of course.

638
00:44:39,870 --> 00:44:43,600
I always pray here before going to my competitions and I won.

639
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:45,810
Alright.

640
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:55,620
How is it? Don't you feel more at ease?

641
00:44:55,620 --> 00:44:57,660
Did you wish to become the national representative?

642
00:44:57,660 --> 00:45:00,980
No, I wished that I could perform without regrets.

643
00:45:02,150 --> 00:45:05,820
I'll make sure to go support you later with Joon Hyeong. Good luck!

644
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:08,910
- If I do well, I'll treat you all.
 - You can do it!

645
00:45:08,910 --> 00:45:11,820
I can't even hit you hard in case you break.

646
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:20,330
Eat.

647
00:45:21,790 --> 00:45:25,020
Why? This is a sumptuous meal.

648
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:28,990
Do you think I'd prepare the nine side-dishes besides a basic meal set?

649
00:45:28,990 --> 00:45:34,830
I mean, I can't eat fried eggs without ketchup.

650
00:45:34,830 --> 00:45:36,730
What?

651
00:45:36,730 --> 00:45:41,780
Never mind, I'll just eat it.

652
00:46:12,890 --> 00:46:17,100
- I guess I'll have to buy it.
 - Here.

653
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:19,390
I have money.

654
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:32,600
Hey! Um...

655
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:36,910
Get some m-m-mayonnaise too!

656
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:39,960
It's me.

657
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:41,790
Oh?

658
00:46:41,790 --> 00:46:45,820
The door was open so...

659
00:46:47,670 --> 00:46:50,430
He's not even a child.

660
00:46:50,430 --> 00:46:53,580
He can't eat a fried egg without ketchup? Ugh, seriously...

661
00:47:00,530 --> 00:47:04,330
Stay still. You have to have a heat massage for it to get better quickly.

662
00:47:04,330 --> 00:47:09,320
Goodness, I'll do this by myself later. It's fine.

663
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:12,640
Leave now. What Bok Joo's uncle said was right.

664
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:15,690
Don't pointlessly visit here often, you'll create misunderstandings. Leave.

665
00:47:15,690 --> 00:47:20,360
It doesn't matter! Who cares if someone misunderstands?!

666
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:33,890
You know that I liked you since long ago.

667
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:39,520
Wh-Wh-What nonsense are you talking about?

668
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:46,230
Why would you like me? What do you lack that you would like an old divorced man like me?

669
00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:50,880
Putting all of those aside, I like you as a woman likes a man.

670
00:47:51,750 --> 00:47:54,720
What do you think of me?

671
00:47:56,030 --> 00:47:58,110
Do you not like me?

672
00:47:58,970 --> 00:48:02,370
Am I really not appealing at all?

673
00:48:13,630 --> 00:48:18,410
I understand. I'm really sorry.

674
00:48:18,410 --> 00:48:23,640
I won't do anything that will put you in an awkward position ever again.

675
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:26,650
I'm sorry.

676
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:46,600
Are you okay? Goodness, are you okay?! That's why I told you to just do the heat massage!

677
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:49,880
It's fine, it's fine, it's fine! It'll hurt even more.

678
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:53,660
It's because of me, isn't it? What do I do? What do I do?

679
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:25,770
Ah, I'm more nervous. Unni Si Ho has to perform well today.

680
00:49:25,770 --> 00:49:30,230
Goodness, women have a strange bonding skill that's not natural.

681
00:49:30,230 --> 00:49:32,580
Since when did you start calling her "unni"?

682
00:49:32,580 --> 00:49:35,320
Are you laughing at me right now? You're looking down at me, aren't you?

683
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:40,690
No, I'm not looking down at you. I'm just saying that women have a bigger plate.

684
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:44,780
By the way, this is nice. Now we don't have to hide and date in secret.

685
00:49:44,780 --> 00:49:47,440
It would have been so nice to be this open much earlier!

686
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:50,100
How can you say that after you emptied your pockets like that yesterday?

687
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:54,360
That's right. I'm planning on making it even more obvious how much I like you after paying that high of a price for my crime!

688
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:57,620
Ah, I'm already worried.

689
00:49:57,620 --> 00:50:00,160
Imagine how much they're cursing me out behind my back.

690
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:04,070
"Is Kim Bok Joo's family rich?" "Wasn't Jeong Joon Hyeong threatened into this?"

691
00:50:04,070 --> 00:50:09,100
"Kim Bok Joo hit the jackpot," or "Jeong Joon Hyeong could do so much better." Imagine how much gossip is going around right now.

692
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:12,500
Hey, don't say things like that. Don't you know how pretty you are?

693
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:17,640
Don't worry. I'll make it obvious that I like you more than you like me so you won't hear those things.

694
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:21,090
Look. Excuse me, isn't my girlfriend pretty?

695
00:50:21,740 --> 00:50:24,900
- Isn't she really pretty? Isn't she beautiful? 
 - You crazy bastard, let's go.

696
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:28,090
- This woman is my woman!
 - Ugh, what's wrong with you?!

697
00:50:28,090 --> 00:50:30,510
- Let's hurry up and go!
♬    I really think that he should know  ♬

698
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:33,630
♬    That his rhythm's go go go  ♬

699
00:50:33,630 --> 00:50:37,700
♬    Does he wash up? Never wash up. Does he clean up?  ♬

700
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:40,840
♬    No, he never cleans up. Does he brush up?  ♬

701
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:45,130
♬    Never brushed up. He does nothing  ♬

702
00:50:53,890 --> 00:50:55,490
Si Ho.

703
00:50:56,030 --> 00:50:58,870
Are you ready? How's your condition?

704
00:50:58,870 --> 00:51:00,070
I'm fine.

705
00:51:00,070 --> 00:51:03,770
Perform comfortably, as you've always done.  For you it's the last

706
00:51:03,770 --> 00:51:06,350
and for me the start. You know that, right?

707
00:51:06,350 --> 00:51:11,060
 Yongsan Sports University's Na Eun Ji and Haneul Sports University's Song Si Ho of Team A, please get ready. 

708
00:51:20,210 --> 00:51:26,000
 t's Athlete Song Si Ho from Haneul Sports University. She's well-known among rhythmic gymnastic fans, 

709
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,760
but she made a mistake in the previous first stage of the selective competition.

710
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:34,080
  Yes, because no matter how much experience you have, you can't help but be nervous when competition comes around. 

711
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:38,280
 She showed us a flawless and clean performances in her preceding hoop and club portions. 

712
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:41,460
 -Yes.
 - She particularly received high points in the "artistic" category. 

713
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:43,520
 Yes, that's right. 

714
00:52:13,460 --> 00:52:16,300
 Ah, what a pity, Athlete Song Si Ho. 

715
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:18,740
 To go so far,, this is a huge mistake. 

716
00:52:18,740 --> 00:52:21,540
 Yes, she sent the ball too far. 

717
00:52:21,540 --> 00:52:26,590
 0.1 point deduction on each extra step. And it's expected an additional 0.3 points deduction on the over line. 

718
00:52:26,590 --> 00:52:29,080
 - Yes.
 - It's a pity. 

719
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:36,730
Don't be scared. You'll receive good scores.

720
00:52:36,730 --> 00:52:40,510
Just control your expressions well and perform well on the remaining ribbon performance.

721
00:52:46,060 --> 00:52:48,850
 Yes, 18.2. 

722
00:52:48,850 --> 00:52:53,860
 Besides the deduction from her mistake in throwing a ball, I don't think there was any other special deduction. 

723
00:52:53,860 --> 00:52:58,270
  I know. It seems that her mistake of stepping outside of the line wasn't deducted. 

724
00:53:06,260 --> 00:53:08,590
Seriously, I can't do this because I'm so disappointed.

725
00:53:08,590 --> 00:53:11,340
Someone gets a point deduction if their ribbon slightly touches.

726
00:53:11,370 --> 00:53:13,470
And someone else receives all of the points even if they step outside of the boundary line.

727
00:53:13,470 --> 00:53:17,470
That's what I'm saying. Only athletes without their coach's support lose out.

728
00:53:20,830 --> 00:53:26,780
 Yes, this athlete is definitely an A-lister. This is Haneul Sport's University's Song Si Ho with her ribbon performance. 

729
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:32,790
  Haneul Sports University's Song Si Ho's advantage is her ribbon performance. 

730
00:53:32,790 --> 00:53:37,140
 This is Piazzolla's Libertango. 

731
00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:39,510
 Just like the title of the piece, I hope that she'll be able to perform it freely.  

732
00:53:39,510 --> 00:53:41,910
 - Yes.
 - Let's watch now. 

733
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:29,570
- What is she doing?
 - Pick it up!

734
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:37,870
- What are you doing? Si Ho, are you crazy?!
 - Do it again! 

735
00:55:55,920 --> 00:56:00,800
Your ex-girlfriend was pretty awesome today. I acknowledge it.

736
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:02,710
Yeah, she really was awesome today.

737
00:56:02,770 --> 00:56:04,570
I'm about to slightly regret breaking up with her—

738
00:56:04,580 --> 00:56:06,110
Cancel. Cancel what I said.

739
00:56:06,110 --> 00:56:09,960
You always somehow manage to earn pain. Watch your words.

740
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:13,430
At this rate, you might get your hair ripped out.

741
00:56:13,430 --> 00:56:17,580
You were the one who said it first— Okay, I'll be careful.

742
00:56:21,260 --> 00:56:23,470
Joon Hyeong.

743
00:56:23,470 --> 00:56:28,450
One day, we'll stand on our last stage too.

744
00:56:28,450 --> 00:56:33,540
Then, will I be able to put everything down resolutely like Unni Si Ho?

745
00:56:34,230 --> 00:56:35,700
I'm not confident I can do that.

746
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:39,910
Hey, you never know. You'll never know until you get there, that's life.

747
00:56:41,330 --> 00:56:42,980
I'm suddenly scared.

748
00:56:42,980 --> 00:56:47,160
Hey, that's not something you can avoid just because you're scared. There's no reason for you to cower in advance.

749
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:49,820
First, let's do our best to live today.

750
00:56:49,820 --> 00:56:52,660
Do your best to weightlift, I'll do my best to swim,

751
00:56:52,660 --> 00:56:56,590
and we'll do our best ... to date.

752
00:56:56,590 --> 00:57:01,230
Oh, your comment just now was elegant and awesome, Jeong Joon Hyeong.

753
00:57:01,230 --> 00:57:04,790
Should I put down some of my luggage?   (Jim)  Awesomeness?  (Meotjim) 

754
00:57:04,790 --> 00:57:07,310
Ugh, what a corny joke.

755
00:57:07,310 --> 00:57:10,220
Fine, I really won't do it. I really won't

756
00:57:10,220 --> 00:57:12,680
but after you keep hearing this for a while—

757
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:15,060
Aren't you going to be quiet? Let's go.

758
00:57:15,060 --> 00:57:17,990
Alright. Let's go.

759
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,900
 Couple's Pharmacy 

760
00:57:22,790 --> 00:57:25,550
I guess Jae Yi is going to be home late again today.

761
00:57:25,550 --> 00:57:29,730
He said that he's preparing for a seminar. He'll probably be at the clinic.

762
00:57:29,730 --> 00:57:33,760
Anyway, I need to marry him off soon.

763
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:37,890
I mean, does he lack the looks or is his profession not good enough?

764
00:57:37,890 --> 00:57:41,040
He's in his prime, but he's always stuck working in the clinic.

765
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:43,460
Are you dissatisfied that he's working hard?

766
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:46,250
If other people hear you, they'll curse you out. You're too greedy.

767
00:57:46,250 --> 00:57:48,890
I'm just saying this because it's a pity.

768
00:57:48,890 --> 00:57:52,550
Who was that girl last time? Ah Yeong? She was perfect.

769
00:57:52,550 --> 00:57:57,110
It seemed as if she liked our Jae Yi too. I can tell at one glance.

770
00:57:57,110 --> 00:57:59,520
Goodness, can you?

771
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:02,260
You should quit being a pharmacist and become a psychic.

772
00:58:02,260 --> 00:58:04,700
I wonder if I should.

773
00:58:04,700 --> 00:58:07,500
Our business is closed for the day.

774
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:12,400
Sister-in-Law.

775
00:58:14,890 --> 00:58:16,930
Brother-in-Law...

776
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:25,710
What happened?

777
00:58:25,710 --> 00:58:28,570
Why haven't you contacted us for so long?

778
00:58:31,490 --> 00:58:34,410
Whenever we looked at Joon Hyeong, do you know how much...

779
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:39,900
How could you be so irresponsible?

780
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:42,390
I'm sorry, Sister-in-Law.

781
00:58:44,180 --> 00:58:46,930
I have nothing I can say to you, either, Brother-in-Law.

782
00:58:46,930 --> 00:58:50,620
It's fine. There's no need to talk about what's in the past.

783
00:58:50,620 --> 00:58:53,400
So, how have you lived until now?

784
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:56,060
It's true you lived in Canada, right?

785
00:58:56,060 --> 00:58:58,380
When did you come to Korea?

786
00:58:59,180 --> 00:59:03,080
I have lived in Vancouver, Canada all along

787
00:59:04,130 --> 00:59:07,500
and returned to Seoul a few days ago.

788
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:12,150
Because I came here suddenly,

789
00:59:12,150 --> 00:59:14,810
I couldn't even get in touch with you beforehand.

790
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:24,860
I have something to tell you.

791
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:27,040
It's really

792
00:59:27,860 --> 00:59:30,500
shameless of me to ask, but...

793
00:59:35,190 --> 00:59:40,010
So disloyal. Organizing the mats doesn't even take that long and yet they all left.

794
00:59:40,010 --> 00:59:44,060
Sure, deep-fried pork cutlets are important, but—

795
00:59:45,530 --> 00:59:49,750
Excuse me, Student. Where is the building with the swimming pool?

796
00:59:49,750 --> 00:59:51,330
This is my first time at this school.

797
00:59:51,330 --> 00:59:55,490
Ah, it's right there if you go in that building right over there.

798
00:59:58,790 --> 01:00:01,250
Should I lead you to it?

799
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:03,920
Thank you.

800
01:00:11,180 --> 01:00:13,860
The swimming pool will be right there if you go this way.

801
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:15,510
Thank you.

802
01:00:22,090 --> 01:00:24,510
Oh, Joon Hyeong!

803
01:00:25,300 --> 01:00:27,040
Bok Joo!

804
01:00:38,250 --> 01:00:40,050
Joon Hyeong.

805
01:00:44,860 --> 01:00:46,630
Joon Hyeong.

806
01:00:48,460 --> 01:00:50,910
Do you recognize me?

807
01:00:57,430 --> 01:00:59,900
It's me, your mom.

808
01:01:01,620 --> 01:01:05,700
