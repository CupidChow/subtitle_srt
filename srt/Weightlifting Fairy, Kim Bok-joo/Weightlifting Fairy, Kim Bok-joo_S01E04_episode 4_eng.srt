1
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:37,130


2
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:42,400
You know how new bills tend to stick together.

3
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:46,620
Is it 590,000 won? Let me count it one more time.

4
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:10,550
Yes. It's 590,000 won.

5
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:14,790
Yes. I guess I won't need to count it, because you've counted it many times.

6
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:17,000
We've accepted â‚©590,000.

7
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,520
You completed your payment. Please change clothes before being checked by the doctor.

8
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:25,010
You can go into the fitting room and put on the medical patient gown in the locker.

9
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:28,070
M-Medical patient gown?

10
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:33,580
  Episode 4
 Her double life. 

11
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:46,400
Bok Joo, you're much healthier than expected.

12
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,860
Yes, I am a bit healthy.

13
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:53,470
I make sure to eat meals on time very well and I seem to be growing well.

14
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:55,260
That's not what I meant.

15
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:59,090
Even though it's overweight, there is an unhealthy  overweight with a lot of accumulated body fat,

16
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:03,010
and there is a healthy overweight that has a lot of muscles. In Bok Joo's case, you belong to the latter.

17
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:05,180
Is that a good thing?

18
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:11,000
Of course. There is a BMI index that can compare the body fat to the body muscles of the whole body.

19
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,940
If you look here, your BMI is 24. It's in the normal range.

20
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:20,940
There are a lot of people who think of themselves as fat from comparing their weight to the size 44 people or girl groups.

21
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,450
As a doctor of an obesity clinic, it feels very unfortunate.

22
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:27,270
Right? When I was watching girl groups on TV,

23
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:32,210
their one meal consists of only a half of sweet potato and one egg. That's bird feed, not a human meal.

24
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:36,360
Out of my friends, I have a friend named Jung Ran. She said she was going on a sweet potato diet, and

25
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,830
she ate one box of sweet potatoes in one day.

26
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,340
But those extreme diets have a high chance of failing.

27
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:50,020
As I said before, dropping weight slowly and healthily is the most important,

28
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,530
rather than the numerical reduction.

29
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:56,430
Yes. I'm not looking to drastically drop my weight at once.

30
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:05,450
For twenty years, because I've lived well with this body,

31
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:09,480
I like it better... that healthy weight loss.

32
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:14,860
Good. For your healthy weight loss, let's look forward to doing well.

33
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:38,530
In that case, should we go to the bed?

34
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:41,000
Bed?

35
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,530
For your size measurement. Please go lie down over there.

36
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:05,440
I'll apply the cream.

37
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:25,220
We'll start.

38
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,320
It will be cold.

39
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:52,340
Please write down everything you eat, including snacks. This will be for the consulting.

40
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:55,750
There are stretching methods on here as well. Please do them from time to time.

41
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:58,060
Thank you.

42
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:00,520
Take care, Bok Joo.

43
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:03,640
Today is the first day so don't adjust your menu too much.

44
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:07,940
There is a high chance of rain at night, so don't go around getting rained on like last time.

45
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:12,530
Ah right, the umbrella. I'll return it to you next time I come.

46
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:16,500
I wasn't asking for you to return the umbrella. Did it sound like that?

47
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:21,370
No. I have to return it to you because I borrowed it from you.

48
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:25,310
Then, goodbye Doctor.

49
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:29,780
Go carefully.

50
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,310
How do I do this?

51
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:02,720
Rather than that one,

52
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,570
this one seems like it will suit you better.

53
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:14,460
It's pretty. Look at the mirror.

54
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:20,210
Does it not suit me?

55
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:23,650
It makes you look much more feminine and pretty.

56
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:29,800
Please give me this one.

57
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,780
I'll wrap it for you.

58
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:36,810
Do you make these and sell them?

59
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:41,260
I sell them and also give them as gifts.

60
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:45,460
 It doesn't seem polite to only give back the umbrella.  

61
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:55,630
- Are you dating these days? 
 - Pardon? No.

62
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:57,640
Then why aren't you managing your weight?

63
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:00,790
It's not like you're going around dating and eating.

64
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:04,810
I really don't know what  I should do with you.

65
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:07,870
You're not going to Russia. You're awful at managing your weight.

66
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:10,080
Since you're doing this, do you think it's possible for you to make the national team in the second round?

67
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,890
I want you to feel a sense of urgency.

68
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:16,150
I understand. I'll manage my weight.

69
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:21,520
Hey, me too.

70
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:25,960
- It's sweet. 
 - Unni, let's hide this and eat it again.

71
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:28,020
We have to eat it next time. We really have to eat this next time.

72
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:30,670
Of course, we eat this next time.

73
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:35,490
But what's wrong with Song Si Ho these days? Her body is slow, too.

74
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:39,230
Yesterday, she barged into the boy's dormitory and made a fuss with her ex-boyfriend.

75
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:40,510
Really?

76
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:42,470
Maybe her shock from failing the national audition was too big?

77
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:45,390
It's the first time I've seen Coach getting mad at Si Ho.

78
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:46,260
Right, right.

79
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:48,970
She always said, "Our Si Ho, our Si Ho," and liked her.

80
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:52,090
I feel bad for Song Si Ho.

81
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:52,920
Huh?

82
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:57,590
I mean... She is getting old, her body is getting slow, and her skill hasn't come back.

83
00:07:57,670 --> 00:08:00,310
Her family even has to support her if she wants to do anything.

84
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:03,010
Why? Isn't she rich?

85
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:06,150
You don't know?

86
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:09,620
There was a big incident today.

87
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:13,110
- What is it? 
- I met coach earlier. I went, and

88
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:17,320
Song Si Ho came in.

89
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:23,880
It's true that I barged into the men's dorm.

90
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,400
But it's not true that I made a fuss.

91
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,630
Kids made it too dramatical.

92
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:39,100
Soo Bin.

93
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,990
Yes.

94
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:44,380
Thanks for understanding my heart.

95
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:48,380
But, I'll worry about my family.

96
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:51,200
I don't think you need to as well.

97
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,200
Yes.

98
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,640
Goodbye.

99
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:02,670
- She's so scary. 
 - It's okay.

100
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,490
What's wrong? Are you okay?

101
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:49,170
You must have indigestion. What to do? Here.

102
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:52,480
Thank you.

103
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,410
Aren't you Song Si Ho?

104
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:00,100
Hello.

105
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:04,760
Wow, It has been a long time. When did you come back from Taeneung?

106
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,470
It's been a few days.

107
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:09,340
If I say, "Nice to meet you," it isn't proper in this situation, is it?

108
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:11,750
It's okay. You can go back in again.

109
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:14,840
There are so many people who didn't even go near Taeneung.

110
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,400
Yes.

111
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:19,180
Is your stomach okay? Should I go to the medical office and give some medicine?

112
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:22,060
No, it's fine. Then...

113
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:23,910
Stop by at the medical office once.

114
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:26,790
I'll massage your ankle. You had a bad ankle.

115
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:31,470
I will. Ah, I have to go to practice.

116
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:33,860
Oh, yeah, yeah, go, go.

117
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:36,600
- Um, this.
 - Alright.

118
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:46,650
She didn't even eat that much, yet she got indigestion.

119
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:56,100
Will this be okay? Of course, it's okay! It's not even an expensive present.

120
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:12,290
Ugh! You scared me, you bastard!

121
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:18,800
Wow! Most women flinch back when they're scared but you get ready to punch first. As expected.

122
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:23,360
- Hey, since we're at it, should I allow my fist to meet your face?

123
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:28,760
Hey, hey.  Why are you taking my joke so seriously?

124
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:31,940
- What is that? 
 - You don't have to know.

125
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,840
You bought something to eat again, didn't you? What is it?

126
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,420
If it's not something to eat, what is it?!

127
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:41,170
You're crazy! What are you really going to look at?

128
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:47,400
Hey, hey, I'm really sorry. I keep forgetting that you're a girl.

129
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,630
I'm really sorry.

130
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:53,980
I'm sincerely sorry. Bok Joo, I'm sorry.

131
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:04,750
What?

132
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:07,830
What?

133
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,430
Ah, what is it?! What's wrong with you? You're scaring me. Are you filming some horror movie?

134
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:27,990
This isn't about me. It's about my... friend.

135
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:31,380
Among the three musketeers, aside from you, who?

136
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:33,720
Not those people!

137
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:37,140
Anyway, my friend

138
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:41,540
has a man she likes. She's in a situation where she has to return something she borrowed.

139
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:44,600
I guess she wants to give him a present because she's thankful.

140
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,290
Will that be okay?

141
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:48,840
- Hey, then is there anyone who doesn't like receiving presents? 
 - Right, then it's all right?

142
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:52,690
Well, as long as it's not something handmade.

143
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:54,370
What's wrong with a handmade gift? Why won't he like it?

144
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:56,470
Hey, think about it.

145
00:12:56,470 --> 00:13:02,990
Making a gift for someone means that she thought of him the entire time she was making the gift.

146
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:06,780
It's burdensome. You said that they weren't even close yet.

147
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:08,090
It's burdensome?

148
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:15,150
Yeah. If a woman shows her emotions so blatantly, the man is 100% bound to step back.

149
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:24,260
It's better to just write a simple message thanking him--

150
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:27,760
Hey!

151
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:32,210
I almost made a huge mistake! Almost!

152
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:35,890
What would I have done if I hadn't met Joon Hyeong?

153
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:43,450
Simple as possible.

154
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:57,350
Is this okay? Ah, my handwriting looks lacking.

155
00:13:57,350 --> 00:14:00,560
I should have practiced a bit. This looks like an elementary schooler wrote this.

156
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,860
Oh, sorry.

157
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:22,040
That's pretty. Did you buy that umbrella?

158
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:25,350
No, I just borrowed it from someone.

159
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:33,750
 Kim Bok Joo, your appointment will be tomorrow 2 pm. 
 J Obesity Clinic 

160
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,300
 Kim Bok Joo, your appointment will be tomorrow 2 pm. 
 J Obesity Clinic 

161
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:37,580
I guess something good is going on.

162
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:40,270
No, what "good thing"?

163
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:43,210
I guess you must be dating. Lucky you.

164
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:49,460
What dating? You're better at misunderstanding things than I thought you'd be. Dating, in my position right now?

165
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:51,970
You really can't lie.

166
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:53,790
I'm not lying, I'm telling the truth.

167
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:59,350
Fine, then I'll just say you aren't. I'm going to sleep first. Goodnight.

168
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:10,470


169
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:18,870
What? Really? Really, really?

170
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:21,480
Yeah, the rumors are all over the school.

171
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:25,360
Also known as "Song Si Ho's Ambushes the Male Dormitories."

172
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,380
It'll definitely place within the top three in our weekly news.

173
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:30,910
Wow! She's much more capable than she looks. She has proper swag.

174
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:34,050
Those from RG Club have a vicious side to them.

175
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:37,010
Hey, they're the ones who chew chicken to taste it and then spit it out.

176
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:41,660
Hey, the ambush isn't the problem. I'm more surprised at the fact that she dated Jeong Joon Hyeong.

177
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:43,940
I mean, why? She's so pretty. What does she lack that she dated him?

178
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:46,880
Jeong Joon Hyeong is quite a hot student in our school.

179
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,760
Yeah, you have to admit what you need to admit. Jeong Joon Hyeong's face is alright.

180
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,410
What would you do with a good signboard when the neon sign is flickering?

181
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:55,500
You can't judge him by his external appearance.

182
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,880
You know, you have to become a human on the inside.

183
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,250
- He hasn't become a human yet.
 - Hey, hey, hey.

184
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:04,360
Are you three the only ones here? Huh?

185
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,690
Did you come to the training room to gossip?!

186
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:08,080
These kids, you've been slacking off these days.

187
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:11,270
Since you've been attending the same school for the past two years, your seniors seem like your friends

188
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:13,220
and the training room seems like your playground, doesn't it?!

189
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:14,400
No, I'm sorry.

190
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,120
- We were wrong. 
 - We were wrong.

191
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,250
It's been a while since they've slacked off.

192
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:21,710
They don't even take proper care of the equipment after training either.

193
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:27,770
Look at this chalk dust. Hey, is this a beggars' den? Is it a beggars' den? Huh?!

194
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:30,070
What? What? What? What's wrong? What's going on?

195
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:33,670
Ah, these kids have it too easy these days. They suck at taking care of the equipment.

196
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:35,880
All they do it gossip in the training room.

197
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:41,840
Hey, take it easy. If that's the problem, then isn't it our fault for not educating them properly?

198
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:45,270
What are you doing? Finish setting up the training equipment before the professor arrives.

199
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:47,770
- Yes, Sunbaenim.
 - Yes, Sunbaenim.

200
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:51,810
Hey, Bang Woon. If you just let them off like that, what do we become, since we made such a fuss?

201
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:53,830
It's time for training. If you're going to scold them, do it later.

202
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:58,940
Why do you get to decide that? Huh? Is the Club President the only senior here? Are you the only 4th year here?

203
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:01,880
Hey, how many medals have you earned? Huh? Weâ€”

204
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:04,680
Sang Cheol, sorry. Just a minute.

205
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,640
Ah, I'm so speechless. Seriously...

206
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,070
Hey, Sang Cheol, you got completely ignored.

207
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:20,570
He's seriously a bother, ugh! Are we his food or something? Whenever we do anything, he always has something to say.

208
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:23,910
I used so much strength in wiping that my hand is trembling. Look at this.

209
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:28,810
That's a yearly event. Even last year too, the graduating seniors were very sensitive.

210
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:32,740
Well, his graduation is right in front of his nose and there aren't that many competitions left.

211
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:36,140
It's about time he should receive calls from a professional weightlifting team but no one is calling him.

212
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:37,450
I'm sure he must be frustrated.

213
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:41,190
Still, this isn't just someone else's problem. We'll soon be in our 4th year too.

214
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:44,120
Still, I don't think that's something to take out on his juniors.

215
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:50,340
Of course! So let's not become seniors like him. Well, I'm sure it won't happen since we're talented.

216
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:52,590
Hey, I'll leave first. Return my tray for me.

217
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:54,750
- Hey, hey. 
- Where are you going? Bok Chicken again?

218
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,310
Yeah. I have an appointment so I'm going.

219
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:57,880
Heyâ€”

220
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:09,880
Black and gray. It's not like there's sorrow in the family. I bet a monks closet is more colorful than this.

221
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:13,540
I guess this is the best. Ugh!

222
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:50,360
Welcome.

223
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:54,810
- I used it well, Doctor. Thank you.
 - Oh,

224
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:58,480
you could have just kept this, although this isn't mine. It's my younger sibling's.

225
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,580
No, it's a given that I should return it, because I borrowed it.

226
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:07,390
I have... a kind of perfect character that I can't live if I owe something to someone... except  money.

227
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:10,410
Your hair clip is pretty, it suits you.

228
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:15,840
Really? Oh, I just found it lying around the room so I put it on.

229
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,530
I see. May I check your BMI first?

230
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:21,040
Yes.

231
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:31,110
How can there not even be a change of 100 grams? Ha, that's strange.

232
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:35,970
This is just the start. Since you have a muscular frame, I expected it would take time.

233
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:39,570
and we promised to lose healthily.

234
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:41,660
Yes, healthily.

235
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:45,520
Still, since you have some obesity index in your abdominal region, we'll focus on there.

236
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:51,860
For the abdominal region, exercise is vital but college students these days don't have the time.

237
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,290
A little...

238
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:58,490
Ah, may I ask what your major is?

239
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,410
â™¬   WHAT   â™¬

240
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:03,100
Pardon? M-majorM

241
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:07,040
Y-You see...

242
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:11,370
The cello!

243
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:15,120
The cello? The cello?

244
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,300
Oh, you're majoring in music!

245
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:25,050
No wonder. To be honest, I was a bit surprised to see you at first.

246
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:30,770
It's difficult for a woman to lift something like that unless she has unusual arm strength or muscle strength.

247
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:35,880
That must be because you're used to carrying around a heavy instrument, right?

248
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,040
- Yes, well... I guess so.
 - Wow,

249
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:43,540
I want to hear you perform one day.

250
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:48,320
As you can see, I really like classical music.

251
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,790
Sometimes, I even go to watch performances.

252
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:54,550
Of course I'm an amateur compared to you.

253
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:56,800
Ah, but...

254
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,710
People who play celloâ€”

255
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,520
It's fine, you can answer it.

256
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,120
I don't have to.

257
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:11,000
Athlete Kim! Where are you?

258
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,140
Why do you want to know?

259
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:14,970
What do you mean, you rascal? I'm on the way to your school

260
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:18,100
and I want to give you some chicken. Are you in your dorm?

261
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:19,750
No, I'm not there.

262
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:23,210
Then I'll just put it in your room so eat it with your friends, bye.

263
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:25,240
No, don't go!

264
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,990
Hello? Hello?!

265
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:32,200
Something urgent happened so I'll come back tomorrow. I'll make sure to stick to your diet plan.

266
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,460
Goodbye, Doctor.

267
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:06,300
Aishee! If he meets them, everything will be revealed.

268
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:10,340
Oh! Hi, Fatty!

269
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:12,110
Hey, are you crazy?

270
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:15,070
Hey, I'm sorry but could you give me a ride to the dorms? Come on, hurry.

271
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:18,070
Ahjumma, this isn't a taxi.

272
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:23,930
Huh? What's this in your hair? Is this a dragonfly? What is this?

273
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:27,700
Hey, this is urgent! Please! Come on, hurry!

274
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:29,560
Back, back, back, back!

275
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:33,070
Aish, seriously... Madame Kim, you're seriously such a nuisance.

276
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:35,160
I don't have time!

277
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,980
- Wait a minute.
 - Hurry up, hurry!

278
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:44,240
Go quickly!

279
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,040
- Go quickly! Faster! Hurry!
 - Where are you hitting?!

280
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,060
Faster!

281
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:52,660
- Hey, you pig-like thing!
 - Hey!

282
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:03,590
Faster, faster!

283
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:06,550
This fat pig, seriously...

284
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:09,570
Go faster!

285
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:17,570
Hey, you're not even going to say "thank you"?

286
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:20,050
Dad!

287
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:25,520
I'm not her driver. Ah, the saddle sank down.

288
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,760
Dad! Dad! Dad, Dad, Dad! Dad, Dad! Dad, Dad, Dad!

289
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:37,190
Why are you running? I can just give the chicken to anyone upstairs.

290
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:40,730
This is the women's dorm. Men aren't allowed.

291
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:45,320
Geez, am I a man? I came for delivery so many times that the Dorm Dean and  everybody here  knows me.

292
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:47,670
I'm safe to pass.

293
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:50,420
Fine, I got it. Just give it to me and leave.

294
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:53,850
Fine. I'm busy too, you rascal. Even if you ask me to stay, I won't.

295
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:55,450
Go! Go, go, go! Hurry!

296
00:23:55,450 --> 00:24:00,700
Wow, wow, wow! Athlete Kim, your arm strength has increased since you've trained so hard.

297
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:02,680
Hey, you might be able to carry me at this rate.

298
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:06,440
Ah, why are you gossiping today out of all days? Just leave and start earning the money you love so much.

299
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:11,870
Money? Yeah, I have to go earn money. Enjoy it.

300
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:23,780
When I review your answers on the questionnaire  from last time,

301
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:27,260
you have high levels of stress.

302
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:33,390
Well, since you're an athlete, being under constant uneasiness from competitions will be a source of stress itself, of course.

303
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:39,440
By any chance, do you have any symptoms you experience on the day of the competition?

304
00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:48,850
  My heart pounds as if it'll explode 

305
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:53,960
  and the sounds around me become distant. 

306
00:24:55,920 --> 00:25:01,440
In the end, I can't hear anything at all, as if I've become deaf.

307
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,810
You can't hear anything at all?

308
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:07,600
Then are those symptoms limited to the days of the competition?

309
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:11,940
It used to but recently, it has happened a few times during training too.

310
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:15,610
I even went to the ENT (ear, nose, and throat doctors). They said I don't have anything wrong in my ears.

311
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:18,440
Of course, because this is a psychological problem.

312
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:23,560
So due to extreme shock or high levels of stress, it could be a type of

313
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:29,640
PTSD or panic disorder that occurs after receiving pain, from what I think.

314
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:36,080
Then, when those symptoms first started to appear,

315
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,510
was there something that could have prompted it?

316
00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:47,490
I don't know. Nothing really comes to mind.

317
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:55,670
From what I see, you're someone with strong defenses.

318
00:25:55,670 --> 00:25:59,990
You hesitate in bringing out the bottom of your heart. You hold it down.

319
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:02,380
You don't want to look inside yourself either.

320
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:04,940
Come on, I'm not that complicated.

321
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:07,000
See? You won't admit it.

322
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,450
Goodness, this is a problem. You're our pickiest patient.

323
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:16,330
but you have to drag that out

324
00:26:16,330 --> 00:26:18,790
so I can help you.

325
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:20,880
Because of that reason,

326
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,580
I think we'll have to become closer.

327
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:26,530
Coffee?

328
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:28,470
Okay.

329
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:51,350
  Then when those symptoms first started to appear, 

330
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:55,320
 was there something that could have prompted them? 

331
00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:11,700
  Merry Christmas! From Mom. 

332
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:36,930
What? Why are you here?

333
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:39,580
- By any chance, did you come all the way here because of me?
 - Yeah, you rascal.

334
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:42,600
I came to monitor you so you won't just slack off in counseling. What?

335
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:45,030
Come on, that's a lie.

336
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:48,490
I had a seminar nearby. The timing seemed similar so I thought I could give you a ride home.

337
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:53,270
As expected, you have your own motive, right?

338
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:55,520
What about counseling? Is it doable?

339
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:59,080
Yeah, I don't think he's a quack. He's quite good at reading people.

340
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:01,550
Yeah, I told you that he's a prominent doctor.

341
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:04,800
That's what I said, he's amazing.

342
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:08,040
I won't disgrace you so don't worry.

343
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:10,610
Where's the car?

344
00:28:10,610 --> 00:28:12,400
Let's go.

345
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:20,480
What is that?

346
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:23,760
Oh, that's your umbrella you lent me.

347
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:31,070
Why would you place an umbrella in this bag? You should've just given it to me.

348
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:33,500
I lent it someone and they returned it like that.

349
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,830
Who?

350
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:37,200
A girl?

351
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:41,110
Yeah, a girl but she's a patient at my hospital. She said she majors in the cello.

352
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:44,030
Oh? A student majoring in music at that?

353
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:49,500
Well, men have a fantasy about women who play music, right?

354
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:52,400
Hey, don't force us together.

355
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:55,500
- I won't create a scandal with my patient.
 - So,

356
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:58,940
is that female student pretty?

357
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:01,090
Goodness, she's quite pretty.

358
00:29:01,090 --> 00:29:03,480
Oh, really?

359
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:09,450
Then I'll stop by. Tell me the date and time.

360
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:12,530
You're here?

361
00:29:12,530 --> 00:29:15,450
- Oh! What is that? Is that something to eat?
 - No.

362
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:19,610
Ah, you got a present! This is absolutely from a girl.

363
00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:23,950
Hey, I just received my umbrella after I lent it to my older brother.

364
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:26,950
Happy now?

365
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:31,650
Wow, flower-prints. Your brother's taste is unique.

366
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:34,290
What is this? What is this? What is this? I caught you now!

367
00:29:34,290 --> 00:29:36,620
Would your older brother write you a letter like this? You're lying! You're lyâ€”

368
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:39,250
Hey, hey, hey! That isn't mine.

369
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:48,340
  Thank you, Doctor. What you lent me that day wasn't just an umbrella, it was your warm heart as well. 

370
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:54,640
Goodness, Jeong Jae Yi properly seduced another innocent female student again.

371
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,840
This Cello has completely fallen for him.

372
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,960
Cello? Who is that?

373
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:03,030
Same person as the flower patterns.

374
00:30:09,090 --> 00:30:11,790
How do you know Joon Hyeong?

375
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:15,090
Ah... We're classmates, elementary school classmates.

376
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:18,790
Well, we couldn't graduate together because he transferred in the middle.

377
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:22,890
Ah... Do you know that he dated me?

378
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:25,580
Yes, I heard from the other students.

379
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:29,500
Your taste is... really...

380
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:35,760
I guess we have some sort of fate. This is fun.

381
00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:47,890
 J Obesity Clinic Report 

382
00:31:00,410 --> 00:31:02,570
-  Teacher, I did wrong!
 - Hey!

383
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:04,100
Then don't do it any more!

384
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:06,730
Hey, hey, hey, Bok Joo!

385
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:10,030
What's so fun in the morning? Huh?

386
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:11,320
You've all been slacking off.

387
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:13,650
Hey, Team Captain!

388
00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:16,270
Hey, where's the team captain?

389
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:19,190
He left last night after receiving a call and hasn't returned since.

390
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:21,690
What? Are you saying Woon took an unauthorized leave?

391
00:31:21,690 --> 00:31:22,910
Yes.

392
00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:25,970
Hey, Sang Cheol. For now, just lead the kids and run.

393
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:27,790
- Yes.
 - Go quickly.

394
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:29,910
Everyone, gather.

395
00:31:29,910 --> 00:31:33,610
Gather, gather! Run.

396
00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:36,540
Hey, run faster! Run, you rascals!

397
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:42,500
What's going on with him?

398
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:55,200
Hey, give this to me and get another tray. I'm tired.

399
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,000
Give it back while I'm being nice.

400
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,780
What's up with this? You have the appropriate amount of food.

401
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:02,100
There should be the famous mountain tops on this plate.

402
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:06,240
The rice should be the Rockies, the meat should be the Alps, and the fish cakes should be the Himalayas.

403
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:10,490
Now that I look at it, you look like you've lost weight, Kim Bok Joo.

404
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:14,470
- Did Bok Joo lose weight?
 - Lose what?

405
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:17,490
Hey! What weight? Stop talking nonsense and give it back to me!

406
00:32:17,490 --> 00:32:19,570
- I don't want to.
 - Give it back.

407
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:22,450
- You're going to die. Give it to me!
 - Get another tray!

408
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:23,860
Give it back!

409
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:25,950
- Give it back!
 - Hey, hey, Bok Joo! Come on, let's go.

410
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:28,220
Hey, I'll just get you your food. Come on.

411
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:30,320
- Give it back!
 - "What's wrong with you? Why do you keep doing this?"

412
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,340
- Give it back to me!
 - "Why do you keep doing this to me?"

413
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:34,980
- Give it back to me.
 - Joon Hyeong.

414
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:38,580
- Stop it, come on.
 - Give it back!

415
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:41,580
- What's wrong with you, seriously? Give it back!
 - Just get another tray!

416
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:44,450
- Hey, hey, hey! You're going to spill it, careful!
 - Give it back!

417
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:48,210
- Give it back! Give it back!
 - You're going to spill it!

418
00:32:48,210 --> 00:32:50,550
Bok Joo, what are you doing?

419
00:32:56,630 --> 00:32:59,280
Bok Joo is my roommate.

420
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:02,220
You didn't know?

421
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:20,080
It's nice to eat together like this.

422
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:26,120
We don't usually eat our meals on time. I occasionally come in for lunch.

423
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:28,510
- Ah...
 - Ah, yes...

424
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:34,090
Joon Hyeong, you look thin today.

425
00:33:34,090 --> 00:33:36,580
You should take care of yourself.

426
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:41,880
Ah, right. You like acorn jelly, right?

427
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:46,130
Take mine. I have to eat a vegetable-based diet.

428
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:51,450
I'll leave first. I have something to do.

429
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:58,190
I'll leave too. Enjoy your food.

430
00:34:03,630 --> 00:34:05,180
Is there a need for you to do this?

431
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:07,630
Can't we even eat a meal together?

432
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:10,040
There's no reason we can't,

433
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:14,830
but I don't like making other people uncomfortable.

434
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:19,540
You always only think about yourself.

435
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:24,560
Let's date again.

436
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,380
Let's date again.

437
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:36,460
No matter how much I think about it, it has to be you.

438
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:38,590
You're reallyâ€”

439
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:42,640
I know. You're speechless. After all, I was the one who said we should break up,

440
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:46,980
but it was so hard for me back then.

441
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:51,630
An important competition was right around the corner but my condition wouldn't improve.

442
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:54,790
  That's right! Good, look at the ball! 

443
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:57,590
  There you go! 

444
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:03,050
  Si Ho, hold your balance. 

445
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:10,350
  Raise it higher! Push in! Put some strength into it! 

446
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:13,630
  If you keep doing like this, forget the Nationals and everything else will be over, understand? 

447
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:15,820
  Your balance is completely off! 

448
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:17,740
  Why are your skills declining? Huh?! 

449
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:21,220
  It wouldn't be enough even if your skills improved. If you don't do well this time, you're done for. 

450
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:25,170
  You'll have to retire without even being able to dream about becoming the National Representative. 

451
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:35,640
  Joon Hyeong 

452
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:42,610
 Let's break up. 

453
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,870
 What did you say? 

454
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,690
 Let's break up. 

455
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:50,990
  I just want to concentrate on gymnastics. 

456
00:35:50,990 --> 00:35:55,150
  I know that you're having a hard time because you ruined your competition but I'm having a harder time. 

457
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:58,520
  Putting out the fire under my feet (taking care of my own emergency)  has to come before helping you, 

458
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:01,570
  but you keep bothering me so I'm irritated. 

459
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:06,510
  I want to stop playing the role of your girlfriend. 

460
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:09,030
I'm sure you must have had a reason

461
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:17,190
but that day, just for that day, what I was going through was worse!

462
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:20,410
I was disqualified and felt like dying!

463
00:36:20,410 --> 00:36:23,060
But what? You?

464
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:28,430
You didn't even keep the most basic of manners.

465
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:30,520
Yeah.

466
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:34,670
At that time, my desperation came before your pain.

467
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:39,500
I'm sorry.

468
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:41,790
I was wrong.

469
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:43,760
I was too selfish.

470
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:47,150
I'll do better from now on, so!

471
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:49,260
So...

472
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:53,090
please date me again.

473
00:36:58,030 --> 00:37:01,120
You find me a pushover, don't you?

474
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:05,670
I'm leaving.

475
00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:08,950
Joon Hyeong, I was wrong!

476
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:17,780
- I can't digest.
 - I couldn't even eat properly.

477
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:21,460
Hey, what was that atmosphere earlier? Are they dating again?

478
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:24,220
It didn't look like it. Isn't Song Si Ho just going after him on her own?

479
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:29,140
You never know between a man and a woman. It could a love quarrel.
  You have an appointment tomorrow 7 pm. J Obesity Clinics 

480
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:31,120
Isn't that right, Bok Joo?

481
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,860
Aish! Hey!

482
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:34,880
- What is it?!
- It's nothing.

483
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,790
Come on, let's go! We'll be late for training. Oh!

484
00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:39,020
It's Sunbae Bang Woon.

485
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:41,290
I think he's just coming in now.

486
00:37:41,290 --> 00:37:45,040
I don't know what is going on but it feels like there's going to be a dog fight.

487
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,210
Hey, let's stay low.

488
00:37:47,210 --> 00:37:48,910
Let's go.

489
00:37:48,910 --> 00:37:53,080
Hey, I heard my home town has already filled up the spots.

490
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,350
Then aren't we hopeless?

491
00:37:54,350 --> 00:37:57,620
Why are we hopeless? Is that the only competitive weightlifting team there is?

492
00:37:58,390 --> 00:38:00,490
Hey, Bang Woon!

493
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,150
What happened to you?

494
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:08,320
I'm sorry. I'll go meet Professor and Coach first.

495
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:11,000
You view your comrades as crap.

496
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,680
Hey, did something good happen?

497
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,650
The fact that you're in a good mood is practically written on your face.

498
00:38:15,650 --> 00:38:18,820
It seems you have something to say to me. Let's talk later.

499
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:21,190
Ah, you're such an bad luck jerk. Seriously...

500
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:26,390
Hey, after taking an unauthorized leave and missing out on morning practice, as the Team Captain,

501
00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:28,890
at the very least, shouldn't you give an excuse to us?

502
00:38:28,930 --> 00:38:30,630
Shouldn't you give us something to work with if we're your classmates?

503
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:31,850
Sang Cheol is right on that.

504
00:38:31,850 --> 00:38:34,560
Do I have to report my personal matters to you all too?

505
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,520
Since when have we ever made such a big fuss about being classmates?

506
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:39,100
I wasn't going to say this because it would make me seem petty,

507
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:41,750
but by any chance, have you received a call from a competitive weightlifting team recently?

508
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:44,200
Did you visit that team or what?

509
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,890
Hey, what is he saying right now?

510
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:51,270
Well, a perfect ace like you wouldn't be cautious around losers like us.

511
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:54,800
Fine, just ignore us. Just ignore us, you traitor-like bastard.

512
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:58,290
I don't know what you're saying right now but...

513
00:38:58,290 --> 00:39:02,190
- wait a minute, I--
 - Where are you planning to go when we're in the middle of talking?

514
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:03,650
I have to answer that call. Give it to me.

515
00:39:03,650 --> 00:39:06,140
Hey, move. I guess this is some Coach.

516
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:09,580
- Give it to me, you bastard! Do you want to die?!
 - You bastard, what did you just say?!

517
00:39:09,610 --> 00:39:11,980
- What's wrong with you?! Stop.
 - Give it back to me!

518
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:13,710
Have those kids gone crazy?

519
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:14,650
Don't do it!

520
00:39:14,650 --> 00:39:18,490
Hey, hey, hey! Hey! Hey, what's wrong? What's going on?

521
00:39:19,350 --> 00:39:21,640
What do you think you guys are doing?!

522
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,770
Straighten your positions.

523
00:39:34,770 --> 00:39:38,280
Lower your butt! I'm adding ten minutes every time one of you falls down.

524
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,880
Rascals who've lost their minds.

525
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:45,280
You rascals, I... You rascals, you... Do you think I trained you that hard so you could fight with each other? Huh?!

526
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:48,600
You rascals, you have to become human beings first.

527
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,030
Endure it!

528
00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:55,240
You rascals, to get a medal or to become a national team member, you should have fought like this.

529
00:39:55,290 --> 00:39:57,090
You can't even endure this!  Coach Choi!

530
00:39:57,090 --> 00:40:03,090
You have to scold these kids once and make them weightlift all night! And make them do more!

531
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:08,580
When I was in America, in Atlanta, for the Olympics, this is something that could have never happened! You want to know why?!

532
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:11,600
Weightlifting itself is hard enough, where would we have the energy left to fight?! Huh?

533
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:16,560
If you had trained very hard, what else could you have done? I'm so frustrated!

534
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:19,160
Uh, that's crazy.

535
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:23,610
Hey, let's sense the atmosphere here. The professor is really angry.

536
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:30,500
Bow! 
 Bow! Thank you!

537
00:40:31,650 --> 00:40:33,700
Dismissed!

538
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:50,880
Get up right now.

539
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:55,680
Shake it off and come out front.

540
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:22,120
Why aren't you guys sitting? You wasted so much unnecessary energy, so you guys should eat.

541
00:41:22,850 --> 00:41:25,480
Hey, what are you guys doing? Some of you should come here and help us cook, and

542
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:28,440
the rest of you should set the table and sit down!

543
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:31,080
Yes! Yes!

544
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:39,760
To be honest, I have diabetes,

545
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:43,830
so the hospital told me to not eat meat that's so fatty like this.

546
00:41:43,830 --> 00:41:45,750
But I still eat it.

547
00:41:46,650 --> 00:41:49,650
They said to not eat any meat and to eat healthily.

548
00:41:49,650 --> 00:41:52,990
Rather than living unhappily, I eat what I want to eat,

549
00:41:52,990 --> 00:41:57,340
and I want to live happily. That is what I think.

550
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:04,260
I wish you guys would do that too.

551
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:06,740
I don't want you to be happy  because you get medals and become a national team.

552
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:09,370
I wish you guys could be happy with weightlifting by itself.

553
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:17,580
If other coaches heard me talking like this, they would laugh at me.

554
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:22,740
But, after many hard years, you get a medal,

555
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:26,670
but your body is in bad shape because of the strain that comes with weightlifting.

556
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:29,470
I hope you guys won't become the kind of athletes who leave the weightlifting that you've done for your life.

557
00:42:30,550 --> 00:42:35,700
If getting a medal is your goal, and you can't get one, then you will be unhappy.

558
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:41,300
But if you love that act of lifting that heavy, cold weight,

559
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:44,200
then aren't you happy with just the fact that you're weightlifting itself?

560
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:51,510
We are sorry.

561
00:42:55,170 --> 00:42:59,840
These days, I know you guys are feeling disturbed because of this and that.

562
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:04,980
Especially you 4th years, you must also be feeling nervous.

563
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:09,240
But for every competition, it must be over before you can know the results.

564
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:12,350
Your guys' life

565
00:43:12,350 --> 00:43:14,480
is far from being over.

566
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:18,940
Look at soccer matches. You turn off the TV thinking it's all over,

567
00:43:18,940 --> 00:43:22,500
and at the end, the other team makes a last-minute goal.

568
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:26,020
You have to watch until the very end.

569
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:28,350
The person who watches until the very end wins.

570
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:41,040
Aish, why are the words coming out so well today?

571
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:46,010
I'm saying such good words, but this meat is burning.

572
00:43:46,610 --> 00:43:50,230
That is all. Come eat some meat!

573
00:43:50,230 --> 00:43:54,720
We will eat well!

574
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:56,050
Here, take this.

575
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:59,510
Quickly, get it.

576
00:44:03,030 --> 00:44:04,370
Ah, I smell like meat.

577
00:44:04,370 --> 00:44:08,660
If there isn't enough meat, just order some more.

578
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:11,480
- Professor, if you use your personal money again
 - Hey

579
00:44:12,590 --> 00:44:15,810
I'm sorry. I crossed the line.

580
00:44:17,010 --> 00:44:21,580
Excuse me, is it okay for me to leave for a moment?

581
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:25,860
I was going to talk with you separately. What the heck is going on?

582
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:30,000
- Go ahead. You will come back by noon, right?
 - Of course.

583
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,680
It's not a big situation, right?

584
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:34,640
No. I will go and come back.

585
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:36,250
Okay.

586
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:43,620
Choi Coach, to believe in them is to push them forward.

587
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:54,030
â™¬   What can I do but dream   â™¬

588
00:44:54,030 --> 00:44:55,880
Yes, I'm Kim Bok Joo. I made an appointment at 7.

589
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:58,750
I think I'm going to be a little late due to some circumstances.

590
00:44:58,750 --> 00:45:00,740
Oh yes, yes, I've already left.

591
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:04,300
Yes. I will be there in a few minutes. Yes, yes.

592
00:45:05,110 --> 00:45:10,650
â™¬   I want to muster up my courage to invite you  â™¬

593
00:45:10,650 --> 00:45:18,000
Ah, this rain.
 â™¬   I don't know where this feeling came from  â™¬

594
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:25,390
â™¬   There's small quake known only to me  â™¬

595
00:45:25,390 --> 00:45:33,190
â™¬   I who was locked up in a sand castle I made like a little boy  â™¬

596
00:45:33,190 --> 00:45:39,420
â™¬   was still wandering and searching for a dream  â™¬

597
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:48,340
 Jean Baptiaste Breval for Cello and Piano 
Sonata in C Major 

598
00:45:48,460 --> 00:45:50,910
I'm so sorry. You couldn't leave work because of me.

599
00:45:50,910 --> 00:45:53,910
That's alright. I'm usually here this late.

600
00:45:53,910 --> 00:45:56,540
Did you get caught in the rain again?

601
00:45:57,810 --> 00:46:00,000
It must show a lot. Am I ugly?

602
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,900
Ah, that's not it. You shouldn't keep getting caught in the rain.

603
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:05,850
You'll catch a cold.

604
00:46:05,850 --> 00:46:09,210
Your condition has to be good in order for you to take good care of yourself.

605
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:14,010
Yes. I understand, Doctor.

606
00:46:14,010 --> 00:46:16,940
Hey, you did very well.

607
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:20,020
Without losing muscle, you lost 200 grams of fat only.

608
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:21,930
You must've done diet well.

609
00:46:21,930 --> 00:46:26,190
Really? I couldn't do it well, though.

610
00:46:26,190 --> 00:46:30,550
Ah, I'm saying it's true. Why can't you believe me?

611
00:46:30,550 --> 00:46:32,200
Look here.

612
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:36,890
This is your health graph.

613
00:46:36,890 --> 00:46:40,530
This is the body fat and...

614
00:47:13,050 --> 00:47:15,230
Bok Joo?

615
00:47:15,230 --> 00:47:16,630
Yes?

616
00:47:17,130 --> 00:47:19,820
- Yes, yes of course.
 - What is?

617
00:47:19,820 --> 00:47:21,760
- Yes? 
 - Yes?

618
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:28,470
I was going to give you an excellence prize, but seeing that you're thinking about other things, I guess I can't.

619
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:32,310
Ah, no. It's not that I was thinking about other things.

620
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:35,990
It's just that the music is really good.

621
00:47:36,860 --> 00:47:40,100
Right! That  Breval's Sonata...

622
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:44,470
I heard that it was like Czerny to Cellists.

623
00:47:46,350 --> 00:47:51,830
Yes, of course.  We listen to it so much that we've almost memorized it.

624
00:47:51,830 --> 00:47:55,310
Something that long? Wow...

625
00:47:55,310 --> 00:47:59,450
How long do you have to learn it for in order to do that?

626
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:05,610
It's different with every person but

627
00:48:05,610 --> 00:48:09,090
but about 3 monthsâ€”

628
00:48:09,090 --> 00:48:12,440
- Three months? 
 - If it takes a long time, maybe 4, 5, or 6 years?

629
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:15,480
With cello. It's different for each individual.

630
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:17,930
Yes, of course.

631
00:48:19,510 --> 00:48:25,240
Ms. Bok Joo then should we go and start the procedure?

632
00:48:44,290 --> 00:48:46,090
Please come this way.

633
00:48:50,420 --> 00:48:52,490
Hey, I'm hungry.

634
00:48:52,490 --> 00:48:55,490
If it hadn't rained, we could've had more.

635
00:48:55,490 --> 00:48:57,580
Exactly! Why is it raining all of a sudden?

636
00:48:57,580 --> 00:49:01,420
Hey! Bok Joo just disappeared without a word. Where did she go?

637
00:49:01,420 --> 00:49:03,680
She must have been pulled into doing deliveries.

638
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:06,790
She must be super busy.

639
00:49:06,790 --> 00:49:11,080
But don't you think we're a little absentminded as best friends?

640
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:14,840
We ate so much chicken from her place.

641
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:20,230
Is that so? Then should we go and help with serving?

642
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:23,610
Going!

643
00:49:28,580 --> 00:49:30,720
Wow. There are seriously no customers today.

644
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:35,870
Why is your phone so quiet?

645
00:49:35,870 --> 00:49:37,700
The team captain has not called you yet?

646
00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:41,450
Would they call us when we asked them to pay money like that?

647
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:46,160
Why don't we see Bok Joo these days?

648
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:49,430
I told her to focus on weightlifting.

649
00:49:49,430 --> 00:49:52,340
She's preparing for the competition two months from now.

650
00:49:52,340 --> 00:49:55,230
But I miss her because we don't see her as much.

651
00:49:55,230 --> 00:49:58,080
My ugly niece!

652
00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:01,450
Oh wait. I have to use the bathroom.

653
00:50:01,450 --> 00:50:04,860
What's that he's saying, "ugly niece"?

654
00:50:04,860 --> 00:50:06,820
- Hello!
 - Aigoo!

655
00:50:07,910 --> 00:50:11,610
Hey, it's been a while! How about Bok Joo?

656
00:50:11,610 --> 00:50:13,170
Bok Joo isn't here?

657
00:50:13,170 --> 00:50:16,360
Why would she be here at this time? Isn't she at school?

658
00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:20,400
Ah, Bok Joo said she's going to the sauna.

659
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:23,670
I totally forgot. Forgot forgot.

660
00:50:23,670 --> 00:50:26,250
Then, we will see you later.

661
00:50:26,250 --> 00:50:27,990
Go back well.

662
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:34,460
What situation is this? Then, where did she go?

663
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:39,270
How would I know? Wow, awesome. She's so cunning!

664
00:50:39,270 --> 00:50:44,520
We were properly deceived! Wow, Kim Bok Joo, ugh!

665
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:12,950
Kids, why are you here? What? Are you planning to go somewhere?

666
00:51:12,950 --> 00:51:15,000
No, we were waiting for you.

667
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:18,000
You're late. Where have you been?

668
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,340
What do you mean? I went to deliver.

669
00:51:20,340 --> 00:51:23,810
Hey, there were so many orders that there was no end to it.

670
00:51:23,810 --> 00:51:27,480
Don't lie, you wench. We just came back from Bok Chicken.

671
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:31,490
There were flies in the restaurant and your father thought that you were at school.

672
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:37,080
So be honest, alright? What have you been doing these days?

673
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:38,570
Where have you been?

674
00:51:38,570 --> 00:51:41,490
Yeah, just tell us. Don't even think about lying.

675
00:51:42,460 --> 00:51:45,030
- You see, the truth is... 
 - Yeah,

676
00:51:45,030 --> 00:51:47,200
what is it?

677
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:49,510
T-To be honest...

678
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:59,220
I couldn't tell you two because I was ashamed.

679
00:51:59,220 --> 00:52:02,480
What's there to be ashamed of between usâ€”

680
00:52:04,590 --> 00:52:07,390
Ah!

681
00:52:07,390 --> 00:52:09,770
Is it relapsed there?

682
00:52:09,770 --> 00:52:11,800
Is that why you came back from the hospital?!

683
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:16,530
Hey, was that it?! You should have told us earlier! How is that something to be ashamed about between us?

684
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:21,670
Ah, t-that's true but...

685
00:52:21,670 --> 00:52:25,060
So what did the doctor say? Is it serious?

686
00:52:26,050 --> 00:52:27,670
Do you need surgery?

687
00:52:27,670 --> 00:52:30,480
No, it's not that serious.

688
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:35,500
What a relief. Still, you have to be careful from now on. You have to watch your diet too.

689
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:37,680
I should...

690
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:41,180
Well, I thought that my dad would just be worried if he knew.

691
00:52:41,180 --> 00:52:44,350
And since I thought that I would just have to go the hospital for a short amount of time, I didn't tell you two either.

692
00:52:44,350 --> 00:52:47,840
Still, you were bad. Do you know how worried we were?

693
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:52,890
Yeah. From now on, if you keep secrets, you'll get scolded, alright?

694
00:52:52,890 --> 00:52:55,360
Alright, I'm sorry.

695
00:52:56,450 --> 00:52:57,750
Be careful.

696
00:52:57,750 --> 00:52:59,950
Did you get the medicine?

697
00:53:05,410 --> 00:53:09,490
I guess lying is a skill too. How can I get better at it the more I do it?

698
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:21,220
Bach Unaccompanied Cello Suite 1.

699
00:53:21,220 --> 00:53:26,360
Pre... Pre... How are you suppose to play this?

700
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:34,750
It's fine, you can listen to it.

701
00:53:34,750 --> 00:53:36,350
I guess you like classical music.

702
00:53:36,350 --> 00:53:39,800
Yes, well... just a little.

703
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:43,470
You know, Joon Hyeong. Isn't he really charming?

704
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:47,920
You have fun when you're with him and although he looks ignorant, his thoughts run deep.

705
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:52,560
Well, I haven't discovered those points about him so...

706
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:57,780
To be honest, I want to do well with him but he won't open his heart to me.

707
00:53:57,780 --> 00:54:00,470
I hurt him.

708
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:05,220
By any chance, if I need it, can you help me?

709
00:54:05,220 --> 00:54:11,240
M-Me? I'm not sure if there's anything I can help with.

710
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:14,680
Why wouldn't there be? It looked as if you and Joon Hyeong had a special relationship.

711
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:18,270
What special? We're not like that at all!

712
00:54:18,270 --> 00:54:21,480
Fine. Whatever.

713
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:35,470
Although I reassured the kids, I'm in a slump these days too.

714
00:54:35,470 --> 00:54:39,930
I wonder if I'm just taking these precious kids from their families and making them unemployed.

715
00:54:39,930 --> 00:54:43,580
I know. It's about time someone should receive a call.

716
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:47,570
Somehow I think the bad results from the year before had a big affect on the kids.

717
00:54:47,570 --> 00:54:51,060
There's only the upcoming match and then 2 or 3 games left.

718
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:53,960
The kids must be feeling frustrated too.

719
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:56,480
It's their own life. Of course, they would be.

720
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:01,180
So Professor,

721
00:55:01,180 --> 00:55:04,440
I thought of a plan.

722
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:15,210
They said you'll be discharged tomorrow, right?

723
00:55:15,210 --> 00:55:18,860
You didn't even get postnatal care. It's going to be hard by yourself.

724
00:55:18,860 --> 00:55:23,810
It's fine. We can't do that in our situation.

725
00:55:23,810 --> 00:55:27,480
I have enough by myself. I even bought seaweed.

726
00:55:35,270 --> 00:55:37,340
Yes, Professor.

727
00:55:39,190 --> 00:55:41,640
- Weight class?
 - Yeah.

728
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:45,720
Um, this is Coach Choi's idea.

729
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:51,010
That... Of course, I know that gaining weight and muscle isn't easy

730
00:55:51,010 --> 00:55:55,880
but if that happens, it becomes easier for you to win a medal

731
00:55:55,880 --> 00:56:00,430
and I think it's possible for Jung Woo to win a medal too.

732
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:02,880
I'll think about it, Professor.

733
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:05,840
Oh, yes. Think about it

734
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:09,640
and let's talk again. Okay, alright.

735
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:15,160
And Professor, one more person aside from Woon.

736
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:17,290
Let me see.

737
00:57:06,250 --> 00:57:09,560
Bok Joo's weight?

738
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:14,050
We've thought about this multiple times and it's possible.

739
00:57:14,050 --> 00:57:18,250
She has no rival in the 63 kg. weight class. It's a straight ride to the top.

740
00:57:18,250 --> 00:57:22,670
If Bok Joo increases her weight, then her chances of winning a medal also increase.

741
00:57:22,670 --> 00:57:27,040
And even the ones in the 58 kg range then have a chance at winning a medal, so...

742
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:29,040
It can become a win-win for both sides.

743
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:32,610
The remaining competition is an important competition that has their futures on the line,

744
00:57:32,610 --> 00:57:35,940
to the students, especially the graduating students.

745
00:57:35,940 --> 00:57:40,500
To be honest, aside from Bok Joo, 4th year Woon has decided to think about increasing his weight class as well.

746
00:57:41,990 --> 00:57:46,280
I understand what you're saying but I also know that

747
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:49,930
gaining weight is harder than losing it.

748
00:57:59,570 --> 00:58:03,860
You lost 300 grams again. I guess I really do need to give you a prize.

749
00:58:03,860 --> 00:58:05,750
You're a total model student.

750
00:58:05,750 --> 00:58:08,830
What prize?

751
00:58:08,830 --> 00:58:10,900
What are you going to give?

752
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:15,470
Well, what should I give you? It has to be something you want, right?

753
00:58:18,740 --> 00:58:21,700
Think about that slowly. For now, go change.

754
00:58:21,700 --> 00:58:23,610
Yes, Doctor.

755
00:58:37,620 --> 00:58:40,130
What are you doing here, Fatty?

756
00:58:43,510 --> 00:58:51,330


757
00:58:53,620 --> 00:58:58,040
You... Your state... Why?

758
00:58:58,040 --> 00:59:02,520
Joon Hyeong, what brings you here without calling me?

759
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:03,940
Oh, Hyung.  
   What? 

760
00:59:03,940 --> 00:59:05,900
Hyung?

761
00:59:08,980 --> 00:59:11,400
- Do you two know each other?
 - Yeah,

762
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:13,650
she goes to the same...
