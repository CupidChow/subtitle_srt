1
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,850


2
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,760
Doctor, the next patient will be coming in.

3
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:36,870
Yes. Kim Bok Joo...

4
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:40,930
Oh. You, by any chance...

5
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:42,700
Yes, we met by chance a few weeks ago.

6
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:46,740
You are, right? You must be here for counseling.

7
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:48,420
Sit down, please.

8
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:56,050
Wow, I guess we do have some kind of connection.

9
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:00,480
Excuse me, Doctor.

10
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,890
Do you possibly like   Messi  ? 
 (Famous Argentine soccer player) 

11
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:11,230
♬   WHAT?   ♬

12
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:13,120
Pardon?

13
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:15,250
 It's my best tip. 

14
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:19,170
 Men are attracted to women who have interests in common with them. 

15
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:24,360
 What do guys like the most? Sports. Among sports, soccer! 

16
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:30,430
 He'll want to have a glass of alcohol with a woman who likes Messi. 

17
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:35,130
Do you like Messi?

18
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:44,860
If you meant Messi, the soccer player?

19
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:50,990
Yes. Ah, yes.

20
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:57,250
I really like the soccer players. Among them, I really like Messi the most.

21
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:02,180
Of course, I like Messi.

22
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:06,530
He plays soccer very well. Even though he is small, he has an outstanding gut.

23
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:08,690
He really has an outstanding gut, doesn't he?

24
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:11,830
That's why I like Messi so much.

25
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:13,260
Ah... yes.

26
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:18,520
He also looks handso— Uh... really manly.

27
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:22,120
- Yes, that's right. 
 - Right?

28
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:34,700
Let's talk about soccer later. Shall we measure you first, Kim Bok Joo?

29
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:54,330
 You don't need any specialized care. 

30
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:56,950
 Just diet and behavioral therapy. 

31
00:02:56,950 --> 00:03:00,690
 It's more important to reduce weight healthily than to see an instant result. 

32
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:05,630
 Think it over enough and come back to enroll for the program when you decide to do it. 

33
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,010
 Diet therapy + Behavioral therapy = Basic program 590,000 won. 

34
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:25,060
Five hundred—

35
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:33,260
 Come back to enroll.. 

36
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,100
 Come back to enroll. 

37
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:47,160
 Episode 3
 Let it go. 

38
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:57,120
 After scanning your card, put the password... 

39
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:02,440
 What? Why only this much? 

40
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:07,030
Uncle's last birthday present! Ah.

41
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:10,900
I bought a fall jacket needlessly. I should've bought socks!

42
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:16,500
  Weight Enrollment Fee = 590,000₩; Current Balance = 395,402₩; Money Needed = 194,598₩ 

43
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:21,110
 What should I do? I need 200,000 won more to enroll. 

44
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:24,280
 Should I tell Dad to pay me the wage that I've worked for as a part-timer? 

45
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,340
 No, should I lie to him I have to buy a pair of shoes for weightlifting? 

46
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,230
 Okay. That excuse about weightlifting is a good idea. 

47
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:30,410
 Yes, weightlifting! 

48
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:37,450
- Weightlifting! 
-   Check again if you left anything... 

49
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:46,780
Hey, hey! Fatty! Hey!

50
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:49,130
What makes her that busy?

51
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:55,550
Look at her running.

52
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:00,920
No doubt that she is Kim Bok Joo. She has not changed a bit.

53
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:06,140
Patched here and there.

54
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:08,270
It'll become a green motorcycle.

55
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:11,750
Hyung! Let's just buy a new one. Please.

56
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:15,380
He (the scooter)  has done as much as he can if he has worked for 7-8 years.

57
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:19,400
Why will we buy a new one when we have a fine one? We can use it for fifty years more without any problem.

58
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:23,880
I didn't tell you, but how embarrassed was I when I rode this antique during delivery?

59
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:28,440
What's the difference between that and riding on the back of an old man?

60
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,900
Huh? Bok Joo?

61
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:35,440
What's matter at this time?

62
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,580
Just...  Is the scooter broken?

63
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:40,720
No, it fell by itself and only this part was broken a little bit.

64
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,550
Bok Joo, tell your father to switch the scooter.

65
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:47,570
What is this? Delivery is the most essential at the chicken place.

66
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:53,010
Be quiet! Won't you shut your mouth?  Talk after earning 10 won if you have a conscience.

67
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:57,150
What did you do well when you didn't get a dime, even though you worked as an extra or something?

68
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:59,680
What should I do since the head person is a wicked man?

69
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,740
Do I have any power? If I get on his bad side, I'm done for!

70
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:06,040
That's why you should focus on this business instead of wasting your time!

71
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:13,170
Take your mark!

72
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,630
Okay, okay!

73
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:47,910
Joon Hyeong, you swam well with streamline.

74
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:51,170
Just keep doing it like that.  Good job.

75
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:59,070
Okay, good job!

76
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,880
Here.

77
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:05,200
That's right!

78
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:09,220
Straighten your legs!

79
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:16,620
Make the large, smooth, and flowing movement with the ribbon.

80
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:27,450
Soo Bin, since your flexibility is very good, if you complement your accuracy, you'll make it to the nationals.

81
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:30,380
You know that, right? When you kick over, don't release the strength in your legs.

82
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:33,230
Just keep this up. You're doing great now.

83
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:36,960
Now, everyone! Clean up and we'll end practice here for today.

84
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,580
Who were the students that exceeded their weight limit?

85
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:43,790
Stay and do jump rope. If you don't lose weight by today, you can't go home.

86
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:45,420
Attention!

87
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:48,430
- Two, three...
 - Thank you!

88
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:50,730
Si Ho.

89
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:01,470
You're not improving as much as I expected.

90
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:03,930
What could be the problem?

91
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:07,310
When I make  Penché Turn,  the central axis shifts a little bit.

92
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:08,940
If I strengthen the lower body muscles—

93
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:11,410
I don't think that will solve the problem.

94
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:15,550
You see Soo Bin improving these days, don't you?

95
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:16,780
She improved a lot.

96
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:21,070
That's why I'm saying this...what about receiving some special training in Russia during the upcoming break?

97
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:22,880
Russia?

98
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:25,440
Well, although it'll take up a bit of your funds,

99
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:29,130
It's very important how you spend time during winter break.

100
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:31,350
Discuss this with your mother.

101
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:34,530
Understand?

102
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:45,260
Where did Bok Joo go that she's not even answering her phone?

103
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:49,680
Did she go for delivery? Bok Chicken exploits her too much these days

104
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:52,030
There was no mistake.

105
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:53,680
Right.

106
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,120
Nice!

107
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:54,970
Hey, we were here first.

108
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:59,730
What's important about that? Huh? Whoever gets possession first is the owner.

109
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:02,750
What? Were you planning to watch the eating broadcast? Hey, what's the use of watching that?

110
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:06,340
You can't even eat anything because you're worried your weight will increase.

111
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:12,250
Then, why do you read fashion magazines? You can't even wear any of those clothes.

112
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:14,320
Right, Unni?

113
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,830
We don't read fashion magazines.

114
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:20,340
Bok Joo.

115
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:23,440
Where were you all day? You didn't even answer your phone.

116
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:28,300
- Should we go to the sauna? 
 - Sure, Unni.

117
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,500
Let's go.

118
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,470
Do you guys... have some money?

119
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:40,140
Money? I don't know, I have around $20. Why do you ask?

120
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:45,300
I have exactly $11. Why? Do you want to order pizza?

121
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:50,520
Ah, never mind. I'm going to go rest.

122
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,180
Hey, you just got here! Where are you going?

123
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:55,780
Hey! If we pool  our money, we can get at least one whole  pizza!

124
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:08,500
That's why I told you that we should have stopped her rhythmic gymnastics earlier.

125
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,020
It's not enough to move around from leased house to leased house after selling a house,

126
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:14,730
but if we spend any more on her, we'll have to live on monthly rent from now on. Do you understand?

127
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:18,220
So what do you want to now?!

128
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:21,420
As you said, we sold our house to come all the way here. How can we stop

129
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:22,740
when the summit is right in front of our noses?!

130
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:26,310
Whose ambition was that? It's yours! Si Ho didn't want it.

131
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:29,280
Who's going to benefit the most from her doing well?

132
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:32,570
For that poor girl, who is underweight and so nutrient deprived that she doesn't even get her periods,

133
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:36,510
do you think I'm not suffering over this either?!

134
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:47,770
What's up with you? You've been strange since earlier. Did you see a ghost in broad daylight? Why are you so out of it?

135
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:51,710
No, it's just that I thought of a question someone asked me yesterday.

136
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:52,890
What question?

137
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:57,930
She's a patient that came in for a consultation and the minute she sat down, she asked me if I liked Messi.

138
00:11:57,930 --> 00:12:00,560
The soccer player? The one from Argentina?

139
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,760
Now that I think about it, I've always posed questions to patients,

140
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:07,320
but it's been a while since I've received questions myself.

141
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:09,730
And a question that's in line with my tastes too.

142
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:13,450
It must be a fresh experience, seeing you talk about a patient.

143
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:16,680
Was she pretty?

144
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:19,190
Well...

145
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:21,390
Well ... in my eyes, she was pretty.

146
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:39,400
  Crazy wench! You're doing all sorts of things, seriously! 

147
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:43,180
 It's said there is no medicine for lovesickness. Come to your sense, please! 

148
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:46,330
Ow, I think I'm going to die.

149
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:50,650
Ow! That hurts! Ah! Ah!

150
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:54,650
Hey, hey! You're going to break her spine! Stop!

151
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:57,350
Oh, Nan Hee! Are you okay? Hey!

152
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:04,550
Aigoo. No. It's very good, as I like being fully stretched.

153
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:07,430
What's wrong with you since yesterday, Athlete Kim? Is something troubling you?

154
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:09,680
No, my condition isn't very good right now.

155
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,460
By any chance, are you putting on a show so you won't have to go to the mountains tomorrow?

156
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:13,920
I smell something fishy.

157
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,700
Ah, that's right. Tomorrow is the mountain hike competition.

158
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:18,160
If we didn't have that, I could fly around the weightlifting room.

159
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,870
I don't know why our school schedules an event on weekends when we are  allowed to stay out.

160
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:24,160
I'm going to go wash my face.

161
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,590
Sure.

162
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:29,450
Sunbae! Hello!

163
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,790
Ah, what the—

164
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:41,130
I must have really gone crazy.

165
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:43,090
Why aren't you coming to enroll?

166
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:46,910
Aish. He even talks now.

167
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:52,220
I don't have any money and I have to go practice.

168
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:55,150
Please don't be like this.

169
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:57,500
Why aren't you coming to enroll?

170
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,900
Why are you doing this to me? Seriously, stop it!

171
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,520
I must really be losing my mind.

172
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:05,260
Ah! Don't smile at me. Omo, what should I do?

173
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:07,950
You don't have anything to worry about. If you just trust me and follow me—

174
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:09,100
I'm going crazy right now, I have to be—

175
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:13,010
UltraViolet rays are really dangerous to women. You should put this up.

176
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:18,580
- You have to carry a parasol. When it rains, umbrella...
-  I'm getting crazy like this.

177
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:23,490
Like this, ah ah ah...

178
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,450
Hold on! hold on, hold on.

179
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:32,070
I'm really going crazy.

180
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:11,870
You should stop now. I think you've drunk an entire pack already.

181
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:17,050
As expected, you're the best. You actually came out because your jerk of an ex-girlfriend asked you to.

182
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:21,170
Who was the one who threatened to wait all night if I didn't come out?

183
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:30,930
Did something happen?

184
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:34,830
Joon Hyeong, are you a gold spoon? ( She's asking if he is from a rich family.) 

185
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:37,980
Or even a silver spoon?

186
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:41,030
No way, what silver spoon?

187
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:45,350
Just... around a bronze spoon?

188
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:52,500
If I could be born again, I want to be born into a rich family.

189
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:57,960
Whatever I do, I'll receive a ton of support like that, and  I won't have to be cautious of anything.

190
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:03,110
Even if I lived my life lazily, I'd still be married off to a nice household

191
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:07,730
somewhere safe and sturdy, like Pyeongchang.

192
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:12,740
A pretty house that has a garden.

193
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:16,530
Don't say things like this somewhere else. You'll lose your image.

194
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:18,560
Am I pathetic?

195
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:22,460
I'm desperate.

196
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:27,930
Do you know why you're miserable?

197
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:35,590
You always want something that's a step above reality.

198
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:41,460
Lower your greed a little bit.

199
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:46,990
Let's go. It's almost night-attendance time.

200
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:08,960
They are still warm, your hands.

201
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,770
Since we have things scheduled tomorrow, we have to go bed early.

202
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:16,790
Let's go.

203
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:32,900
Whenever I think about having to climb up that mountain tomorrow, I really hate it!

204
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:35,980
It's Saturday, but we can't even sleep in late. We might as well train or something.

205
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:38,550
A whole group of rhythmic gymnasts won't attend the event, using practice as the excuse.

206
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:39,980
Really?

207
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:43,930
If I knew that, I should have done rhythmic gymnastics too.

208
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:48,260
What crap are you saying right now? Joke with a conscience in mind, you wench.

209
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:51,480
Or should I lie that I pulled my hamstring in the morning?

210
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:55,950
It won't work with it. Sunbae Hyeong Cheol also got rejected earlier when he said he got hemorrhoids.

211
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:59,820
Aigh. It doesn't work with hemorrhoids.

212
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,480
Are there only one or two who have it in our department?

213
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:04,060
Last year, Bok Joo was even in and out of the hospital too.

214
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:06,280
Hey, why are you pulling me into this?

215
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:11,080
That's okay. A hemorrhoid is almost like a medal to people who use muscles.

216
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:13,980
In any case, unless we have a serious injury, we have to climb that mountain.

217
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:20,120
There were so many kids who made up excuses that the Dean placed a monetary prize on 1st place.

218
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:22,550
Prize?

219
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:24,620
How much?

220
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:36,040
 Is it 300,000 won? The dean put his personal money into a prize. 

221
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,660
 It's a kind of event. 

222
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:43,960
 If it's 300,000 won, it'll be more than enough for solving the enrollment problem. 

223
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,730
 This is my chance. 

224
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:49,980
  A fate-like chance. If that's the case... 

225
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:55,230
 I will kill myself going up that mountain. 

226
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,570
We're here.

227
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:08,670
Come down quickly!

228
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:17,760
Luckily, we recovered from food poison completely.

229
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,100
The weather is great today.

230
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:23,170
I know you all don't like mountain climbing

231
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:24,740
but this event is an event that we can't avoid.

232
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:28,200
  At the most, it's 338.2 meters tall. 

233
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:33,040
  Fine, I'll place 1st and win that $300.  And so ... 

234
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:37,140
 So come to me, Kim Bok Joo.  

235
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,490
 So?  

236
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:43,520
 Have strength, Bok Joo. You can do it. Fighting!  

237
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:46,080
 So... 

238
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:50,010
So what are you going to do? You have to overcome.

239
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:52,960
Even though the mountain is high, that can't be higher than your dream!

240
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,510
I"m saying that this isn't a big deal.

241
00:19:55,510 --> 00:20:00,690
What is our weightlifters' strength? Even though we keep being stepped on, what is...

242
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:01,540
Spirit of the weed.

243
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:06,040
Of course. The spirit of weed! Being stepped on, it's still the spirit of the weed.

244
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:09,180
Hey. Today, I didn't expect you to get first.

245
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:11,670
All of you, don't give up in the middle.

246
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:15,890
All of you climbing to the top is today's goal and challenge.

247
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:19,800
Got it? The weightlifting club is fat or a fat club or something...

248
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:23,810
Or we can't climb or something, such nonsense talking...

249
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:27,030
We show those who speak such nonsense that we can do it, understand?

250
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:27,940
Yes.

251
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:29,430
Are you all ready?

252
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:31,440
That's right! Let's heat up our heart!

253
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,200
Ready, go!

254
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,560
- Right, go! 
 - Go quickly.

255
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,140
Let's go!

256
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:37,500
Hey, Kim Bok Joo.

257
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,780
Hurry up.

258
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:41,860
Ah, who are you?

259
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:45,560
Go. Go.

260
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:50,360
♬   Following the rain and a rainbow   ♬

261
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,860
♬   in our personal heaven we are   ♬

262
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:54,160
Hey, hey hey.

263
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,430
I'm so tired.

264
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:59,260
Hey, are you okay?

265
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:01,950
Senior. Senior.

266
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:06,400
He sprained his ankle when he was getting off the bus.

267
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,750
I don't think he can climb the mountain anymore.

268
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,320
Really? Is it really bad?

269
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,110
- Yes.
 - Where?

270
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:13,050
Right here.

271
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:16,470
Senior!

272
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:19,550
Are you okay? Hey, right leg!

273
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:23,330
Don't try any funny tricks.

274
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:29,320
Jeong Joon Hyeong. Make sure you reach the peak today, and never fall behind me.

275
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:34,880
The moment you see my back, I'll punish you and your classmates together, understand?

276
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,540
Yes.

277
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:40,200
Go.
 ♬   The tree of dreams I'm growing in my heart  ♬

278
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:44,910
♬   is bearing sweet fruit  ♬

279
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:46,960
Hey, was it obvious?

280
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,130
It was obvious.

281
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:52,970
♬   Love unitl they open full of sunshine  ♬

282
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:56,580
Kim Bok Joo let's go together!

283
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:59,880
- I can't go any further. 
 - Why is she like that? Did she eat something wrong?

284
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:02,700
I don't know. I can't go any further.

285
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,830
Mom...

286
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:29,120
Hey. It's the crazy guy. The crazy.

287
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,580
My friend. I'm going first. Take care of behind.

288
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:35,040
Hey, hey, wait. I'm afraid of him.

289
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:38,170
I'm so scared.

290
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:41,680
Hey let's go together!

291
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:00,030
Fatty!

292
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:07,760
I look at you again. Looking at your size, I'm 100% sure that you'd give up in the middle

293
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:12,260
Is your mentality good, or your stamina good?

294
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:15,250
Hey! Hey! Am I a ghost?

295
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:17,240
Talk.

296
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:21,840
I don't have any strength to talk. Go.

297
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,210
Oh, you got determined properly.

298
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:27,690
Are you going to get 1st place at this rate?

299
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:35,810
Go, Kim Bok Joo. I'll become your strength for you.

300
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:39,490
Go on up Bok Joo!

301
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:41,790
Let's go together.

302
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:44,500
 Beautiful Challenge 

303
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,650
One. Two.

304
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:50,950
Good.

305
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:21,740
Hey, Fatty! Are you all right?

306
00:24:22,810 --> 00:24:25,310
It's because I'm worried I'll have to carry you if you faint.

307
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:30,400
If I pull my back, you're not going to take responsibility. What are you going to do? Will you call for help?

308
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:33,790
Just go, would you?

309
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:43,460
Let's go!  Go up!  Hurry and go!

310
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:45,410
Leave, will you?

311
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:46,900
Don't do that!

312
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:50,000
Let's go. Find strength, Kim Bok Joo.

313
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:54,650
Bok Joo! Oh no, what do we do?

314
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:57,530
What do we do, what do we do?

315
00:24:57,530 --> 00:25:02,070
I'm really sorry. I really didn't do it on purpose.

316
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:07,920
I was really trying to help. You looked like you were having a hard time so I was just trying to help.

317
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:12,310
I think it's time for them to slowly come.

318
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:15,850
Because of a monetary prize, the competition for the first place will be very intense.

319
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:18,950
Should we start getting ready?

320
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:27,030
Hey, I'm sorry.

321
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:30,730
I was just trying to help because you seemed to be having a hard time.

322
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:36,740
What? Are you going to hit my head again?

323
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:41,910
Hold on to me as you go. You're having a hard time.

324
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:44,080
Stop!

325
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:47,720
Hold on to me and go.

326
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,760
Hey. Get on me. I'll take responsibility because I created this mess.

327
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:06,760
Well, is it going to be a big deal that my back's getting pulled? Get on.

328
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:17,100
Bok Joo, I got injured!

329
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:19,480
My knee hurts a lot.

330
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,120
She won't even turn around once.

331
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:50,060
So many people have already climbed up here!

332
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:54,870
Anyhow, no doubt they are the athletes.  They all have such a will to win.

333
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:59,910
Ah... There was a monetary prize. There is no hope for that.

334
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:03,240
Hey. Let's take care of your ankle first.

335
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,200
Let's go to the medical nurse and ask for an ice pack.

336
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,990
Get lost.

337
00:27:07,670 --> 00:27:10,500
- What?
- I said get lost, punk!

338
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:13,380
Classmate? My ass. When did we see each other?

339
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:16,270
Why are you lingering around me and interfering?

340
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:19,730
Please just mind your own business.

341
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:22,350
You ruined everything.

342
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:36,460
By the way, the way she talks is disappointing.

343
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:41,510
Hey. What should we eat? Pigs feet? Pork belly?

344
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:46,860
If not, then shall we eat the draft beer with pork sausage and potato chips, all together,  a lot.

345
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:49,480
Then, I'll vote for number three. Let's eat them until we die.

346
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,020
I also call for number three.

347
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:53,490
Athlete Kim, put in your vote.

348
00:27:54,330 --> 00:27:56,320
I don't have an opinion.

349
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,210
Wow.

350
00:27:57,210 --> 00:27:59,390
Soon Ok, did I hear her wrong?

351
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:00,980
Did Bok Joo say she doesn't have an appetite?

352
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:04,030
Hey, why are you like this? You said your ankle was fine.

353
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:06,890
Hey, it's enough if you went up to the top of the mountain.

354
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:08,720
Yeah.

355
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:14,760
Hey. It's been a while since we came out. Are you seriously going to be like this?

356
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:17,420
Seriously!

357
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:23,210
Let's go, Bok Joo. Na Hee is hungry.

358
00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:27,530
My stomach skin is sticking to my back.

359
00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:30,560
Hey Bok Joo,  hurry. She's at it again.

360
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:31,390
Hurry.

361
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:34,220
Na Hee, I'll go with option 3. Be quiet.

362
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:35,860
How long will I have to hear that?

363
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:46,020
One shot! I don't need anyone else except you guys! Get lost!

364
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:49,080
Now you're acting like Kim Bok Joo.

365
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:53,160
Wow Bok Joo one shot! Swag!

366
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:58,020
 Bok Joo. 

367
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:02,790
 Bok Joo. Cheers, to your healthily losing weight. 

368
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:08,570
Hey, hey. You don't have much of a drinking capacity.

369
00:29:08,570 --> 00:29:12,050
She has already drunk three glasses full.

370
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:14,100
Why are you like this? Drink slowly.

371
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:17,230
Forget it. It's been so long since we've had a break.

372
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:21,450
When will we ever drink again, if not today?

373
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:23,550
- When will we?  
 - Ow, that hurts.

374
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:25,720
Hey. You're hitting the ahjussi.

375
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:30,390
I know. I know. Okay.

376
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:34,070
She started acting drunk after all.

377
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:36,630
Let's hurry and eat and get out here.

378
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:41,280
Na Hee is going to take a selfie.

379
00:29:49,050 --> 00:29:51,940
But did you talk to Joon Hyeong?

380
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:54,890
Isn't he having a hard time because of his disqualification?

381
00:29:54,890 --> 00:29:56,820
That's why he agreed to get counseling from my senior.

382
00:29:56,820 --> 00:30:00,480
Oh, really? That's great!

383
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:04,490
Good job. I was so worried, although I couldn't show it in front of him.

384
00:30:04,490 --> 00:30:08,690
Mental training is also important for athletes. It'll help him a lot.

385
00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:13,700
Oh? This kid knows when we're talking about him.

386
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:17,810
Yeah, Joon Hyeong. Did you eat?

387
00:30:17,810 --> 00:30:22,200
We're eating Octopu— No pancake-wrap. (Rhyme in Korean)

388
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:26,920
I just ate with Tae Gwon.

389
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:29,910
I won't be that late.

390
00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:34,790
Even if you miss me, bear with it for a little. Mother, I love you.

391
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:40,460
Is she your mom or your girlfriend? Whenever I look at you, you're quite cringe-worthy.

392
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:43,750
It's not just "quite." I really love my mom a lot.

393
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:46,200
Oh, oh, oh? Seriously...

394
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,180
- Ah, that's cold!
 - Oh!

395
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,970
- We're so sorry!
 - Aish, forget it!

396
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:58,620
I'm sorry. My friend is too drunk.

397
00:30:58,620 --> 00:30:59,790
We're sorry.

398
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:01,830
If you're going to drink, then drink nicely.

399
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:04,450
Hey, just leave them alone. We'll lose our appetite for alcohol. Sit down, sit.

400
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:08,490
These wenches come here and only drink uselessly.

401
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:13,480
Hey! If you're doing to drink, then drink nicely. What are you planning to become?

402
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,610
A weightlifter.

403
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:18,340
Ah, imagine if she were my sister...

404
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:22,960
I would shave her head bald and lock her up, ugh.

405
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,250
What did you just say to my friend?

406
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:29,390
What? What? What, what, what? I'm going to say what I want with my mouth, so what?

407
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:32,890
Ugh, you have no fear. Huh?

408
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:37,390
Are you majoring in physical education? Ah, no wonder.

409
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:41,530
Hey, stop it. Those losers won't know anything.

410
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:46,650
What did you just say? Los—

411
00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:49,890
- Should I really do something worth being called a loser?!
 - Ah, ah!

412
00:31:49,890 --> 00:31:54,520
- Calm down, calm down.
 - Aish, seriously.

413
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,910
Hey, this place is not so good. The patrons are so-so as well.

414
00:31:57,910 --> 00:32:01,190
I'm tired after climbing the mountain. Let's just drink a bit here and leave.

415
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:03,170
Hey!

416
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:07,650
Don't get so worked up.

417
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:12,730
- Hey. 
- Why  are you, wretches, degrading us? You cowards!

418
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:14,830
Hey, aren't those our classmates? The weightlifters, right?

419
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:17,050
- Hey, stop it. Let's leave.
 - I'm the one that's speechless.

420
00:32:17,050 --> 00:32:19,190
Hey, I don't want to fight with someone like you, so just apologize and get lost.

421
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:20,860
We already apologized, so you get lost.

422
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:23,420
"You"? How dare you say that to an elder? You lack basic manners.

423
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:25,720
- Get lost.
 - Am I a candle? Why are you telling me to get lost?  ("Get lost" and "blow out" sound the same) 

424
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,460
The only candle in the situation, you, deserves capital punishment right now.

425
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:31,360
Your brain deserves capital punishment more.

426
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,850
- Stop it! Stop it!
 - Hey, just forget it and get lost already!

427
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:35,480
Look at the way he talks, capital punishment, capital punishment!

428
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:38,870
What is this? Are you a woman?

429
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:40,900
- Then am I man?
 - You're uglier than a man.

430
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:42,560
Your face deserves capital punishment more!

431
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,790
Ah, I should just—

432
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:45,950
Is it okay to disparage women?

433
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:48,030
- Stop it.
 - Let go of me.

434
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:49,770
Ah, such ugly wenches!

435
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:51,660
Hey, let's go.

436
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:55,200
Hey, do you think I'll go easy on you just because you're a woman?

437
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,080
Hey, do you think you can do anything if you're majoring in physical education? Huh?!

438
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:02,760
Why would that even come up right now? You were the one that cursed us out first!

439
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:05,590
Wow, if I do well enough, she might hit me.

440
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:08,390
Hit me. Hit me. I said, hit me!

441
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:10,090
Ah, how dare you?!

442
00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:16,470
Seriously, do you even have anything? Ugh, you all don't even look like girls.

443
00:33:21,090 --> 00:33:23,860
What? This bastard!

444
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:36,090
Hey! I'm a girl too, you bastards! Even if I'm fat, I'm a girl too!

445
00:33:36,090 --> 00:33:41,260
Ah seriously!

446
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:44,120
Hey, hey, stop!

447
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:47,690
Hey, hey, let go!

448
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:50,090
Ah, seriously!

449
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:54,590
- Let's go. 
 - Hey, let's fight!

450
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:56,060
Hey, hey.

451
00:33:56,060 --> 00:34:00,160
Hey! Stand up straight! We can't go anywhere until you become somewhat sober.

452
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:02,170
Sit down here.

453
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:10,100
Okay, I'm sober now. I'm completely sober now. Want to see?

454
00:34:14,490 --> 00:34:16,960
Wear this. It's cold.

455
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,730
What dramatic show is this?

456
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:28,620
It's been a while since we've left school so I thought we could all lift our spirits up a bit.

457
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:31,590
Those mean bastards, ugh!

458
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,560
I'm sorry, I lost my temper again.

459
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:39,430
Hey, you're seriously a problem. What if you really got hit?

460
00:34:39,430 --> 00:34:42,630
Even if we weight-lift, our opponents are men.

461
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:45,020
They didn't look like nice men either.

462
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:47,150
Those bastards were really careless with their words.

463
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:52,190
Ah, I'm doing all sorts of things. One of my friends is a fighter and another is drunk...

464
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:55,880
If I let her drink again, I'll be a fool.

465
00:34:55,880 --> 00:35:00,140
Annoying... I'm cold.

466
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:03,470
Unnie, I'm cold.

467
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:07,550
Ugh, now, drink this and just let it go.

468
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:11,130
Ugh, I almost hit a girl today.

469
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:15,190
Watch your words. Were those kids girls? They're gangsters.

470
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:18,360
I really despise girls with strong personalities.

471
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,480
Even if you give them to me, I won't take them.

472
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,510
Hey, will you really not take it even if they're given to you?

473
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:24,790
Well, maybe one is okay.

474
00:35:25,770 --> 00:35:31,070
Right, you're right! You know, those girls have a special taste of their own. They're rough now,

475
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:36,250
but later on, when they turn docile and submissive, they listen so well. That's awesome.

476
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:40,940
You know Kyung Woo Shik, right? His girlfriend is his girl crush.

477
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:43,680
That bastard said that she's killer.

478
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,120
Hey, what the heck? Explain in detail.

479
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:48,900
You know, instead of those stick thin women—

480
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:51,580
- Excuse me.
 - What?

481
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:04,440
-Jeong, how are you? Do you think you're sober now?

482
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:07,690
Yeah. I feel much better now.

483
00:36:07,690 --> 00:36:11,950
Seeing that you're able to hold a conversation, you're awake. Her eyes are coming back too. Let's go.

484
00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:16,100
Yeah, let's go. Today is really tiring.

485
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:21,030
- Hey! Hey, run! Run, run, run! Run!
 - What? What's going on? Why?

486
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:23,910
- Run, run! Run!
 - Why? Why? Why?!

487
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:28,490
- Run! Come on, hurry up! Run!
 - What in the world?!

488
00:36:28,490 --> 00:36:32,700
- Run!
 - If we catch you, you're dead!

489
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:35,800
- Hey!
 - Run! Run!

490
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:39,270
- Hey, split up! Go that way, go!
 - Run!

491
00:36:41,470 --> 00:36:44,530
Split up!

492
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:49,210
Ugh! Where did those bastards go?

493
00:36:49,210 --> 00:36:52,230
Seriously, where did those bastards go?

494
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:57,170
Hey, hey, what are you doing?

495
00:36:57,170 --> 00:36:59,670
You guys go that way, we'll go this way.

496
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:01,370
No, instead of doing that, we should go that way.

497
00:37:01,370 --> 00:37:04,360
That's what I just said. Hurry up and follow me.

498
00:37:10,810 --> 00:37:11,970
They're gone.

499
00:37:11,970 --> 00:37:13,890
Hey, let's go.

500
00:37:13,890 --> 00:37:16,140
That must hurt!

501
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:31,750
Yeah, let's go.

502
00:37:33,570 --> 00:37:35,280
Lets go...

503
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,240
Hey, hey, hey!

504
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:52,230
You're going to die, seriously!

505
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:11,130
I ran so much I think I'm going to throw up.

506
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:13,630
Oh, what about your ankle? Is it okay?

507
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:17,630
Hm? It throbs just a little but it's fine.

508
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:20,240
But why did we run?

509
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:24,190
You're right. Why did I drag you along and run?

510
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:28,080
I must have let go of my sanity.

511
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:31,420
When did you arrive there?

512
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:35,340
By any chance, did you see everything?

513
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:38,460
See what?

514
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:43,320
By any chance, did you get into a fight because of me?

515
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:46,430
Hey, am I crazy that I would get into a fight because of you?

516
00:38:46,430 --> 00:38:49,030
Hey, I think you're acting like this because you don't know,

517
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:52,750
but I'm not someone with a strong sense of justice or someone who meddles  easily.

518
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:58,640
"Don't care about other people's  business and don't get involved in my business." That's my life motto.

519
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:03,300
Then why did you run? You ran because you got into a fight with them.

520
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:09,110
I mean, maybe it was the first time those bastards saw such a handsome man. They were so aggravating.

521
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:12,440
Well, I understand. Some squids came to have fun,

522
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:16,130
but since all the women were only staring at me...

523
00:39:17,010 --> 00:39:22,400
What are you saying? I just can't have a serious conversation with you.

524
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:29,200
Well, anyway, since I ran so much, I forgot some of my worries.

525
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,170
Thanks, classmate.

526
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:34,980
No problem.

527
00:39:39,290 --> 00:39:42,370
But, what worries?

528
00:39:44,010 --> 00:39:45,360
Is there something complicated?

529
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:48,910
And if I have it, what? Tell you everything?

530
00:39:48,910 --> 00:39:54,100
I don't think you and I are in a relationship where we talk about our inner thoughts.

531
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:57,760
That is, well... okay. I admit it.

532
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:02,530
Hey, let me ask you one thing.

533
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:08,180
Did your personality change or am I not remembering you correctly?

534
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:10,720
Of course, I changed.

535
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:14,820
How can I live in this harsh world being shy like back then?

536
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:19,160
Truthfully, I'm much more attractive now than then.

537
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,620
Right?

538
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:26,470
What are you saying? Move your face.

539
00:40:26,470 --> 00:40:29,190
You look pointed...

540
00:40:50,170 --> 00:40:56,050
That worry. I don't know what it is but don't try to conclude it forcefully.

541
00:40:56,050 --> 00:41:00,990
With this oppa's experience, time will solve that problem itself.

542
00:41:00,990 --> 00:41:03,040
You're showing off.

543
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:12,760
Hey, Bok Joo!

544
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:14,800
Hurry up and come out!

545
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:17,990
Ah, why this early in the morning?

546
00:41:24,270 --> 00:41:27,870
What are doing, being so loud in the morning—

547
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,050
What is this!?

548
00:41:31,050 --> 00:41:34,330
Uncle, what is this?

549
00:41:34,330 --> 00:41:38,990
What do you mean what? It's a scooter.

550
00:41:38,990 --> 00:41:42,900
Even though it's a used one, this one was used so little that it's almost new.

551
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:46,230
And I gave away the one that we were riding.

552
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:51,160
Because it's really an old one they didn't want to take it, so I barely sold it for 100,000 won.

553
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,210
How did you get the money to buy this?

554
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:56,020
I went to the head of Extra Guild and demanded a little bit.

555
00:41:56,020 --> 00:42:01,490
to settle the unpaid payment meanwhile. If not, I'll report it to the media.

556
00:42:01,490 --> 00:42:04,120
If you got picked on by the head, you told me you might not get work.

557
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:08,750
I may quit acting with this opportunity because I don't have talent anyhow.

558
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:12,360
Ah, ah, it's okay, okay.

559
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:13,850
How is it?

560
00:42:13,850 --> 00:42:19,300
If I ride this and make a "boom, boom" sound, I'll look nice, won't I?

561
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:24,430
Oh, Uncle! You look so nice today! The best charismatic!

562
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:32,270
It's true that it's good.

563
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:35,620
It really looks nice.

564
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:50,380
 Hurry! 

565
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:53,020
 Let's get in quickly. Hurry! 

566
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:55,490
 We're late, let's go. 

567
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:56,990
 Hello! 

568
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,030
 Okay, let's just see. Just see. 

569
00:43:02,530 --> 00:43:05,430
 This must be new. Let's do it as a couple. 

570
00:43:05,430 --> 00:43:07,220
 - No, I don't like it. Let's go. 
 - Why? 

571
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:10,750
  Why do we have to match? I really don't like doing like this. 

572
00:43:10,750 --> 00:43:12,710
 Let's go. Go. 

573
00:43:12,710 --> 00:43:15,420
 I got it. Got it. Let go. 

574
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:16,730
 - It's true, right?
 - Yeah. 

575
00:43:16,730 --> 00:43:19,490
 - Really?
 - Yeah. 

576
00:43:19,490 --> 00:43:21,880
 Hey. 

577
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:23,400
 Let's go. 

578
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:25,840
 Okay... 

579
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:27,840
 Let's do it as a couple! 

580
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:29,410
 - Have a nice day!
 - We'll come again! 

581
00:43:29,410 --> 00:43:31,830
 What do you mean we'll come back again? 

582
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:44,980
That'll go well with Joon Hyeong.

583
00:44:10,030 --> 00:44:12,420
This scooter is really different. It took 5 minutes less.

584
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:16,430
Yeah, right! It's good to have a new one!

585
00:44:16,430 --> 00:44:20,030
Don't speed too much, even so. Make sure to be careful, particularly when you make a turn, understand?

586
00:44:20,030 --> 00:44:22,100
Yes, yes.

587
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:25,060
Thank you for dropping me off, Father.

588
00:44:26,290 --> 00:44:28,280
Here, this.

589
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:29,800
What is it?

590
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:35,940
When I looked at you last time when you came, you didn't look good. Don't only do practice. Release some stress.

591
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:38,830
Eat something delicious with friends and go shopping too.

592
00:44:38,830 --> 00:44:41,990
And go to places like the club.

593
00:44:41,990 --> 00:44:43,560
No, I don't need this.

594
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:46,460
Ah, just take it.

595
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:49,090
I thought I had to buy a scooter.

596
00:44:49,090 --> 00:44:51,320
Thanks to your uncle, I saved some money after a long time.

597
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:55,150
It's not good for an athlete to be stressed. Go out and release it. You must.

598
00:44:55,150 --> 00:45:00,810
Ah, your uncle will go to the hospital with me, so you only focus on your weightlifting from now on.

599
00:45:00,810 --> 00:45:04,130
There aren't many customers in the afternoon anyway, so let's do that.

600
00:45:04,130 --> 00:45:06,180
Dad is going.

601
00:45:08,050 --> 00:45:09,970
Father.

602
00:45:11,110 --> 00:45:13,360
Daughter, fighting!

603
00:45:16,090 --> 00:45:18,490
I'm going!

604
00:45:32,250 --> 00:45:33,530
Here you go!

605
00:45:33,530 --> 00:45:35,550
You crazy!

606
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:40,190
It's starting again. My shoulder!

607
00:45:40,190 --> 00:45:43,630
That's why I'm telling you to strengthen your muscles. At this rate, it'll become a habitual shoulder dislocation.

608
00:45:43,630 --> 00:45:47,720
I know it, punk. It's not that I don't know it, but it's because I'm lazy.

609
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:51,270
But still, the only person who thinks about me is you.

610
00:45:51,270 --> 00:45:52,570
Be quiet, you punk!

611
00:45:52,570 --> 00:45:54,900
Why? Why do you act like this?

612
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:58,310
If you're caught by me...

613
00:45:58,310 --> 00:46:02,290
- Come here!
 - Hey, hey! Package! Package!

614
00:46:02,290 --> 00:46:04,990
- What package?
 - Aww, really!

615
00:46:04,990 --> 00:46:06,770
Let go!

616
00:46:06,770 --> 00:46:08,510
It's true!

617
00:46:08,510 --> 00:46:11,060
It's time to receive a new swimsuit from home.

618
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:13,820
Hey, did you buy something again?

619
00:46:13,820 --> 00:46:16,440
You said your dad was having a hard time these days. Is it okay for you to be doing this?

620
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:20,650
Don't worry! It's said that even if the rich go bankrupt, they can still live comfortably for three years.

621
00:46:20,650 --> 00:46:25,210
What is special in life? You just live today as if you don't have tomorrow.

622
00:46:25,210 --> 00:46:28,000
Huh? You have something for you.

623
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,420
Oh. Jeong Joon Hyeong.

624
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:32,590
I didn't have anything that should have come.

625
00:46:32,590 --> 00:46:38,060
It looks suspicious. No name of sender nor address. Only your name.

626
00:47:06,630 --> 00:47:08,670
Yeah, Joon Hyeong.

627
00:47:31,090 --> 00:47:33,510
You must have been practicing?

628
00:47:38,050 --> 00:47:39,670
This.

629
00:47:41,890 --> 00:47:44,000
You found out.

630
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,920
There is only you who would send me something like this.

631
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:51,510
You have only me who'd send it, so can you just put on this one?

632
00:47:52,850 --> 00:47:54,920
Right.

633
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:58,170
For a short time, very briefly, I thought I'd put this on, but

634
00:47:58,170 --> 00:48:02,490
even with my simple brain, I think that I can't wear this.

635
00:48:03,990 --> 00:48:08,680
Understood. I didn't know you would have been that burdened by it.

636
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:11,880
I accept it.

637
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:13,750
I'm going.

638
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:37,490
 No, this crazy wench! If you enroll with this money, you are not a human. 

639
00:48:37,490 --> 00:48:39,730
 Father thinks only about you, whether he is asleep or awake. 

640
00:48:39,730 --> 00:48:44,550
 To make this money, he must have run around the neighborhood several dozens of times riding on that old scooter. 

641
00:48:44,550 --> 00:48:47,090
 Don't do a regretful thing, Kim Bok Joo. 

642
00:48:58,380 --> 00:49:02,020
It's too boring for us to stay like this without beer.

643
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:07,080
Are you human? If you talk about alcohol for awhile, I will kill you.

644
00:49:10,990 --> 00:49:12,350
Girls...

645
00:49:12,350 --> 00:49:14,560
Yeah, Bok Joo, say it.

646
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:18,890
I, from now on, will really only do sports.

647
00:49:18,890 --> 00:49:20,870
You already work hard!

648
00:49:20,870 --> 00:49:23,760
Right. Among us, you're the gutsiest person.

649
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:27,320
No. Recently I've totally been slacking.

650
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:33,610
I'm going to get my act together and from now on work a hundred times harder.

651
00:49:33,610 --> 00:49:37,970
Woah, 100 times more? If Bok Joo does well, it looks like she's going to go to Taeneung (Korea National Training Center) this year.

652
00:49:37,970 --> 00:49:42,500
Only Taeneung? She's going to get a gold medal too.

653
00:49:45,790 --> 00:49:50,650
I am Kim Bok Joo ! I am the promising weightlifter, Kim Bok Joo!

654
00:49:50,650 --> 00:49:56,830
I'm going to work hard and only exercise from now on! Let's go, let's go, let's go!

655
00:49:56,830 --> 00:49:59,280
 Hey! I heard all of your names! 

656
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:02,550
I'm the promising weightlifter, Kim Bok Joo.

657
00:50:02,550 --> 00:50:04,970
- Cheer up!
 - Be quiet!

658
00:50:04,970 --> 00:50:07,190
 Yeah, when has a man ever been in my life? 

659
00:50:07,190 --> 00:50:10,020
I'm Kim Bok Joo! I'm Kim Bok Joo—

660
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:15,530
  This is just a passing incident. Time will take care of everything. 

661
00:50:15,530 --> 00:50:19,430
  Time, pass by! Time! 

662
00:50:19,430 --> 00:50:21,320
  Pass! 

663
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:23,570
Hey!

664
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:38,290
Hey, Bok Joo. There you go. Breathe.

665
00:50:38,290 --> 00:50:40,990
Breathe!

666
00:50:40,990 --> 00:50:43,130
- Fighting!
 - Bok Joo, fighting!

667
00:50:43,130 --> 00:50:45,270
- Hold!
 - Nice!

668
00:50:45,270 --> 00:50:47,290
Wow!

669
00:50:47,290 --> 00:50:48,530
 Wow, that was nice! 

670
00:50:48,530 --> 00:50:51,530
Oh, Bok Joo grits her teeth (determined).

671
00:50:51,630 --> 00:50:56,930
After a long time, someone from Haneul Sports University  will get a gold metal. Let's challenge!

672
00:50:58,460 --> 00:51:00,120
Hooray!

673
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:00,970
Ah, I'm hungry.

674
00:51:00,970 --> 00:51:03,300
Hey, how many times do I have to tell you not to match us to your height?

675
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:05,540
Ah, I can't hear it. Sounds come somewhere?

676
00:51:05,540 --> 00:51:09,470
Hey, should I get double eyelid surgery and get some strong fierce eyes? What do you think?

677
00:51:09,470 --> 00:51:13,230
Wow, you'll look like a celebrity! You'll look like Park Myung Soo!

678
00:51:13,230 --> 00:51:14,510
Hey!

679
00:51:14,510 --> 00:51:15,540
How can you compare me to Park Myung Soo?

680
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:17,510
Don't you check your face? Look at your face.

681
00:51:17,510 --> 00:51:19,150
We're going to have omurice (fried rice omelet) today!

682
00:51:19,150 --> 00:51:22,350
No! Omurice again?

683
00:51:22,350 --> 00:51:23,960
Ah, don't grow up more!

684
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:25,440
I like omurice!

685
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:27,830
What are you going to eat?

686
00:51:27,830 --> 00:51:29,440
Hey!

687
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:32,360
Don't hold us like that!

688
00:51:32,990 --> 00:51:35,890
Fatty seems to be in a good mood.

689
00:51:35,890 --> 00:51:39,010
After coming back from Russia, make sure to come back here.

690
00:51:39,010 --> 00:51:40,990
Of course.

691
00:51:40,990 --> 00:51:43,240
Oh, Si Ho.

692
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:44,620
I'll come again in a little bit.

693
00:51:44,620 --> 00:51:46,270
It's fine, you can talk now.

694
00:51:47,180 --> 00:51:48,860
Yes.

695
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:56,390
Did you discuss it with your mother?

696
00:51:56,390 --> 00:51:59,100
Yes, and I think it'll be difficult this time...

697
00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:04,260
Why? By any chance, does your financial situation not allow you? Is it difficult for her?

698
00:52:06,390 --> 00:52:09,160
Yeah, there's nothing I can do if that's the case.

699
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:11,610
It would have been nice to go together.

700
00:52:11,610 --> 00:52:13,730
What a shame.

701
00:52:15,060 --> 00:52:18,080
I know, right? It's a shame.

702
00:52:22,790 --> 00:52:23,730
Yeah, Mom?

703
00:52:23,730 --> 00:52:26,670
 I heard that you told your coach you won't go to Russia. 

704
00:52:26,730 --> 00:52:30,530
How can you just do whatever you want without even discussing it with me?

705
00:52:31,410 --> 00:52:34,840
What if I had discussed it with you? Could you have sent me?

706
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:37,770
  - What? 
  - You know that all of the training expenses in Russia have to come from our own pockets.

707
00:52:37,770 --> 00:52:41,420
How can you handle airfare, boarding, and coach fees, all?

708
00:52:41,420 --> 00:52:45,410
Please, Mom! Don't bluff when you don't have anything!

709
00:52:45,410 --> 00:52:48,530
I sometimes forget our circumstances and misunderstand!

710
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:24,820
What's she doing in the men's locker rooms?

711
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:28,680
- Where is she going?
 - What's going on?

712
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:31,960
- Ah, she scared me?
 - What?

713
00:53:40,170 --> 00:53:43,470
I understand your intentions and I admit that I did wrong,

714
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:48,300
but don't treat me this way too. What's so hard about accepting this one thing anyway?

715
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:51,510
Whether you wear it or throw it away, you deal with it...

716
00:53:52,420 --> 00:53:54,900
since I already gave it to you.

717
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:13,390


718
00:54:16,940 --> 00:54:20,900
  By any chance, do you like Messi? 

719
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:27,150
Let's go, let's go!

720
00:54:27,150 --> 00:54:29,200
Hey, I'm all done. Whatever, I can't do any more.

721
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:33,180
Fine, it can't be any cleaner than this. Let's go eat galbi.

722
00:54:33,180 --> 00:54:36,750
Yeah, let's go before they run out of galbi.

723
00:54:41,790 --> 00:54:46,640
  Now that I think about it, I like Ronald better than Messi. 

724
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:48,930
  Have a good day. 

725
00:54:55,750 --> 00:55:00,180
  At times, there are passionate feelings that even time 

726
00:55:00,810 --> 00:55:03,370
  or situations cannot take care of. 

727
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:08,620
Ah, Kim Bok Joo!

728
00:55:08,620 --> 00:55:10,480
Hey! Hey, Bok Joo! We're over here!

729
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:12,740
- Hey! Kim Bok Joo!
 - Kim Bok Joo! Hey!

730
00:55:12,740 --> 00:55:17,500
 One day, a mayfly told a garden tiger moth that flew in towards the firelight. 

731
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:20,950
 "You know that firelight is a trap set by humans." 

732
00:55:20,950 --> 00:55:23,390
  "You're not someone who can only live for a day, like me." 

733
00:55:23,390 --> 00:55:27,990
 "Why are you going to throw yourself into a fire even though you know you'll burn yourself to die?" 

734
00:55:27,990 --> 00:55:34,390
 The garden tiger moth said, "That fire light is too beautiful not to dash into it." 

735
00:55:34,390 --> 00:55:37,450
  "There is nothing beautiful in this world without pain." 

736
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:41,390
  Will there be a pit of fire waiting at the end of this path? 

737
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:47,490
  Although I'm scared, for now, I'll just go. 

738
00:55:59,010 --> 00:56:02,030
  I'll run to him. 

739
00:56:48,100 --> 00:56:50,810
♬   How can I get your   ♬

740
00:56:50,810 --> 00:56:52,710
Are you alright? 
 ♬   love?   ♬

741
00:56:56,500 --> 00:57:00,900
Ah, we're trapped here. 
♬   How can I make you smile?    ♬

742
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:02,900
Oh, be careful. Move.

743
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:07,360
Wow, 
♬   This heart-throbbing excitement   ♬

744
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:11,220
you even talk now. I must have really lost my mind. 
♬  colors my feelings    ♬
