1
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:34,030
  Taereung Training Center 

2
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:37,550
Yeah. Of course, it's past lights-out time.

3
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:41,520
I just found a small quiet place.

4
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:46,710
My roommate, Unni from the Yeonnam City Hall team,  is such a light sleeper.

5
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:48,890
Did you do your training well today?

6
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:52,860
Yeah. I dropped my time by another .2 seconds.

7
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:56,960
At this rate, I'm afraid I'll pass over Taereung and beat Phelps.

8
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,800
It's a shame, I really like him. How did your training go?

9
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,790
What about your back?

10
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:08,570
Me? Well, there's no way it would heal quickly. It's a chronic injury.

11
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:15,060
But you lost weight again, didn't you? When I looked at the picture, your already small face is just about to disappear.

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,040
No, it's just love sickness. I lost weight because I miss you.

13
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:25,370
Then why am I not losing weight? I miss you too.

14
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:26,970
 I miss you, 

15
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:32,860
I miss Soon Ok and Nan Hee, and I long for the fried chicken my Dad and Uncle used to make.

16
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:36,470
You still contact your father often, right?

17
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:38,820
Yeah, we talked on the phone earlier.

18
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:42,870
Maybe it's because I'm not there with him, but he had no strength in his voice.

19
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:49,960
Alright. I'll take a look around Bok Chicken tomorrow and check his condition.

20
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,730
Yeah, thank you.

21
00:01:54,260 --> 00:02:03,170
Joon Hyeong. Now that I'm at Taereung, the things that happened at school seem like a dream.

22
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:06,910
I realize that I was really happy and

23
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:11,490
that I had so many great people around me.

24
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:16,130
 Joon Hyeong. Joon Hyeong? 
 ♬   I dream of it   ♬ 

25
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:23,940
Are you sleeping? Sleeping? 
 ♬  Please let us be eternally happy   ♬

26
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:26,810
I guess you are sleeping. Goodness,
 ♬   I dream of it   ♬

27
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:33,210
I even forcefully stayed awake, fighting off my sleepiness,  so I could talk with you but I guess you can sleep. 
 ♬   Please let us have youthful days   ♬

28
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:36,800
When I look at you now, it seems I like you more these days.
 ♬   Even if there    ♬

29
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,090
It hurts my pride. 
 ♬   is a chill wind   ♬

30
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:43,170
Hey! Who's over there?!

♬   Please let the days we smile  ♬

33
00:02:51,210 --> 00:03:01,740

34
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:07,110
  Final Episode:  Spring Again, Youth, and Us. 

35
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:17,890
Joon Hyeong! Joon Hyeong! Joon Hyeong! Hey, you said we would go to the PC room today.

36
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:19,420
I've even warmed my hands up.

37
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:21,590
Hey, I have somewhere else to go. Bye.

38
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:23,350
Hey, where are you going?

39
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:27,040
Hey, hey, Jeong Joon Hyeong! Hey!

40
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,530
That rascal. Where is he going that he's going in such a hurry? Did something good happen?

41
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:36,070
- Comrade Tae Gwon!
 - Hello!

42
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:38,940
We're going to the cafeteria. Want to come along?

43
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:39,870
Sure.

44
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:41,740
Let's go!

45
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:43,260
The cafeteria!

46
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:47,770
  Bok Chicken 

47
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:01,620
  Due to a personal situation with the owner, this business is closed temporarily. 

48
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,750
  In an emergency, please contact... 

49
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,910
Did something happen?

50
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,320
Yes, this is Kim Dae Ho.

51
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:16,790
Hello, Bok Joo's Uncle. I'm Bok Joo's friend, Jeong Joon Hyeong.

52
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:20,300
Ah, our nephew son-in-law.

53
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:22,830
Yes, your nephew son-in-law.

54
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,630
By any chance, did something happen? Bok Chicken is closed, so...

55
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:31,690
What are you doing here?

56
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:35,020
I heard that you were hospitalized so I had to visit.

57
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:38,010
Are you feeling alright?

58
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:39,810
Yeah, he's fine.

59
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:42,210
They said his ulcer needs to be treated before surgery.

60
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:45,510
And his body condition has to be optimized, so he's been admitted to the hospital.

61
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:49,310
By the way, you said that you were just friends with my Bok Joo.

62
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,800
Why are you taking such great care of even your friend's sick father?

63
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,000
Just be thankful if he cares for you. What's wrong with your manners?

64
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,660
Manners? This rascal, watch what you're saying to your older brother.

65
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:03,530
It's been a while since you've been hit, hasn't it? I should just—

66
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:06,770
You, why did you buy something like this? Huh?

67
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:10,330
Let's see. Here, take one.

68
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:14,470
Then when will you undergo surgery?

69
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:18,400
Well, the doctor gave us a date but Bok Joo has a competition on that day.

70
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,510
He's uneasy thinking that Bok Joo might find out.

71
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:30,850
Hey, Weasel. I'm telling you this in uneasiness, but you can't ever tell this to Bok Joo, understand?

72
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:34,650
If she knew that I have a surgery coming up before a big competition, would she focus on her training?

73
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:36,570
She worked so hard for that national title.

74
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:40,690
Yes, I'll keep that in mind, keep that in mind, and keep that in mind again.

75
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:55,370
Yeah, Bok— I'm training right now, so I'll call you again later after I finish. Yeah.

76
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:01,390
What is this? He fell asleep earlier yesterday too.

77
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:04,120
I wanted to hear his voice.

78
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:09,790
What? Can you not get in contact with your boyfriend?

79
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:13,780
Ah, he said he would call me again later.

80
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:16,220
You have a boyfriend? Show me a picture.

81
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:18,620
Let me see his face.

82
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:26,500
Hey, he's really your boyfriend?

83
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:29,500
Don't lie! This is just a boyfriend picture off the internet, isn't it?

84
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,160
No, he's part of the swimming department in my school.

85
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:34,840
Did you save a nation in your past life? He's no joke.

86
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,260
Wow, you hit the jackpot!

87
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:40,600
But you're saying that you can't get in contact with this handsome boyfriend right now, right?

88
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:45,920
This doesn't look like a good sign. Just looking at this, I can predict a split-up.

89
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,710
What?

90
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:49,770
Ninety percent of athletes who had girlfriends or boyfriends

91
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:53,030
break up after coming into Taereung,

92
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:57,140
but there are signs for that. First, you can't get into contact with them.

93
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:58,790
They either won't pick up or ask to talk later.

94
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:02,800
Then, even if you can get into contact, his/her answers and replies become short and cold.

95
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:08,300
Then, finally! The bomb is dropped: "Sorry, I think we should break up."

96
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:11,020
"I have someone else."

97
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:16,410
No! He's in training right now so—

98
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:17,040
How naive!

99
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:20,200
Hey, what training during lunch time?

100
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:27,150
Did we not all come out of a sports university? At your boyfriend's level, I think the longest you two will last is a month.

101
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:29,240
Will women leave him alone?

102
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,880
Right?

103
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:33,690
Comrade Tae Gwon!

104
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:34,800
Hot dog! Hot dog! Hot dog!

105
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,330
Why did you buy, corndogs again?!

106
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:38,770
Corndogs are here. There is no ketchup.

107
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:40,890
Why is there no ketchup? You lack common knowledge.

108
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:42,640
There was no ketchup.

109
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,200
As expected, habits are scary. It tastes so much better with three people.

110
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,550
Comrade Tae Gwon, I'll initiate you to be a new member. Okay?

111
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:53,050
Oh, that would be an honor to my family! Deal!

112
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:56,920
Okay! Then a new member has been initiated!

113
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:59,440
It's a former member.

114
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,830
It's Bok Joo!

115
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:05,980
Yeah, Bok Joo. Why haven't you called for so long? I might forget your voice at this rate.

116
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:11,030
That's why I'm calling you now. Have you been well, our youngest? What about Soon Ok?

117
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:13,590
She's next to me. We're eating snacks right now.

118
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:17,230
Did you eat? Did you call your husband?

119
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:20,220
No, I couldn't. He said he was in the middle of training.

120
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:23,460
What?! Jeong Joon Hyeong is training right now?!

121
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:28,810
What happened?

122
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:32,010
After lying to our Bok Joo, where did Jeong Joon Hyeong go?

123
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:34,970
I really don't know. He just said he had somewhere to go.

124
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:37,580
Jeong Joon Hyeong, that bastard. What the heck is he going around doing?

125
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:40,640
You're suspecting that too, right? A woman.

126
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:46,430
I don't want to either but that's what my senses are telling me. Aside from a woman, what else could there be?

127
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:50,290
Excuse me. Although Joon Hyeong is the type to be obsessed with girls,

128
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:52,880
he's not someone who would betray his girlfriend.

129
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,220
How would you know that?

130
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:56,750
As I'm also a man, I can't guarantee that...

131
00:08:56,750 --> 00:09:03,070
Forget it. We need evidence so that we can get a confession out of him by torture, solve the misunderstanding, or do anything.

132
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:07,510
Comrade Tae Gwon, you'll need to cooperate with us.

133
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:14,560
Um, our nephew son-in-law.

134
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:20,220
I'm not sure if I can say this but can you come here for around two hours tomorrow?

135
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:22,130
My girlfriend is very angry right now.

136
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:26,760
Yes, I'll do that. I'll come after training, Uncle.

137
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,260
Can we let go for a minute?

138
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,940
Yes, Honey?

139
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:40,720
  Aren't you going to come quickly? Where are you, you ******* bastard? 

140
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,940
Why are you cursing? You're the prettiest when you curse, Honey.

141
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:48,470
  Yeah, let's do some pretty things today, you ******* bastard. 

142
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:52,550
  Why aren't you answering? Who's next to you? What's that b*tch's name? 

143
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,890
  Hey, aren't you going to answer me? 

144
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:57,740
  The person you are trying to reach is not available at the moment— 

145
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:01,760
She's not picking up. Is she in the middle of training?

146
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,360
Out of all times, she just had to call me then.

147
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:08,160
I want to hear your voice, Kim Bok Joo!

148
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,920
  Joon Hyeong! 

149
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:14,670
Who is this? Miss Song Si Ho.

150
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:15,670
Have you been well?

151
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:17,500
No, I've just been.

152
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,310
What? Where are you going?

153
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:20,880
To the dorms. What about you?

154
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,870
I'm on my way to the dorms too. Let's go together.

155
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:23,860
Go.

156
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:24,880
Let's go together.

157
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,000
I don't want to. Go.

158
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,440
What's wrong with you? Don't joke around. Let's go.

159
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,560
Fine, let's go.

160
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:36,790
What about counseling? Is it bearable? Isn't the therapist nice?

161
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:38,900
Yeah, he's nice.

162
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:42,440
SinceI started counseling, my heart's been much more at ease.

163
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:47,190
I'm even studying these days. I'm going around taking job interviews to become an assistant coach for kids as well.

164
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:49,430
You're working so hard.

165
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:51,820
Now that I look at you, your face looks brighter too.

166
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,810
Really?

167
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:57,240
By the way, are you in touch with Bok Joo often?

168
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:01,620
- It's not easy to get through Taereung's security and date, right?
 - Yeah,

169
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:05,090
I'm about to resent our country at this rate.

170
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,630
What?!

171
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:37,870
Fine, let's meet there.

172
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:42,370
Nan Hee, Jeong Joon Hyeong like a dog went out again.

173
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:43,640
We have to go right now.

174
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:46,340
Okay, Jeong Joon Hyeong is dead today.

175
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:48,230
Let's go.

176
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:58,360
He's going so fast. He is dying to have a go.

177
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:01,850
It really can't be a woman! If it's a woman, I might really grab his collar.

178
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:05,820
Hey, no matter how much I look at it, it has to be a woman. There's not even a 1% chance it's not a woman!

179
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:08,520
Wow, I didn't know that guy was so unfaithful.

180
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:11,220
- I, who am nothing without faith can't—
 - Shh!

181
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:15,000
We have to capture the scene onsite so make sure not to get caught.

182
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:51,840
Didn't he come to visit someone sick?

183
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:56,560
I know, right? Is the woman he was flirting with hospitalized?

184
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,240
Or maybe... a nurse?

185
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:07,300
We can't even barge into someone else's room.

186
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:09,950
If he's cheating, we absolutely have to catch him in the act.

187
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:15,310
Kim Chang Geol? I've heard that name a lot somewhere. Nan Hee, don't you know a Kim Chang Geol?

188
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:20,640
Kim Chang Geol? Ah, Patient Kim Chang Geol has the same name as Bok Joo's father, Kim Chang Geol.

189
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:23,810
Ah, that's right. Bok Joo's father's name is—

190
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,910
Come on, no way.

191
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:31,420
W-What? What, what, what? Are you getting something? What is it? What, what, what?

192
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:34,380
- This is really delicious.
 - Right?

193
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:39,150
Nan Hee! Soon Ok! How did you two know to come here?

194
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:41,370
- Father!
 - Father.

195
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:44,040
- Father?
 - Hey!

196
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:59,020
Ugh, seriously! The more I think about it, the more speechless I get.

197
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:01,090
- Especially you, Jo Tae Gwon.
 - Huh?

198
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:03,990
Are you my friend or their friend? Huh?

199
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:06,720
How could you suspect me and act as a spy?

200
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:08,810
You see, I had no other choice—

201
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:12,090
Comrade Tae Gwon isn't at fault here. We were the ones who went overboard.

202
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:17,140
Well, Bok Joo was gloomy that she couldn't get in contact with you so our emotions just came up.

203
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:20,870
I'm sorry. Even if we're Bok Joo's friends, we were too hasty this time.

204
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:25,160
Yeah, I'm sorry. We were blinded by friendship and crossed the line.

205
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:30,650
I understand. You two, make sure to keep the secret from Bok Joo.

206
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:34,970
I wonder if I'm doing the right thing too, but this is Bok Joo's father's wish

207
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:36,750
so I think it's right we listen to it.

208
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:40,460
- Alright.
 - Don't worry, we won't ever tell her.

209
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:46,670
Well, there aren't many chances for me to meet Bok Joo so...

210
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:54,310
I'll really end with you after this year.

211
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,230
Joon Hyeong, I love you.

212
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:14,870
What is this? Why is it so hard to talk to you?

213
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:18,730
I'm sorry, the timing is always off.

214
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:21,030
- Where are you?
 - The Weight Room.

215
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:23,390
Where are you? Are you at the dorm?

216
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:28,470
I guess your training got more intense. Why does it seem like you're busier than me in Taereung?

217
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:34,440
Well, training is taking up my time but I'm busy these days because of various reasons.

218
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,450
- Various reasons like what?
 - Huh?

219
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:44,020
I mean, that's just my choice of words. What would cause me to be busy?

220
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:47,030
You're changing your words however you want.

221
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:50,240
Isn't it that you don't have the time but not the heart?

222
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,900
  Kim Bok Joo, come here for a minute. 

223
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:57,770
Yes, Sunbae. Hey, my senior is calling me. Let's talk again later, bye.

224
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:00,680
Hey! Hey—

225
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:05,740
We could only talk for a minute.

226
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:09,180
I miss you more after hearing your voice, Bok Joo.

227
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:19,610
I miss you, Kim Bok Joo!

228
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:23,840
I'm about to go crazy and jump around because I miss you so much, Bok Joo.

229
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:52,210
Concentrate! Let's concentrate! There isn't much time left before the competition. Kim Bok Joo, concentrate!

230
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:08,520
Kim Bok Joo, what's wrong? Is your back acting up again?

231
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,300
No, I think I just sprained it a bit.

232
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:14,530
Aish, your back continues to be a problem. There isn't much time left before the competition.

233
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:16,180
Let me see.

234
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,640
- Does this hurt? 
 - It's bearable, I'm fine.

235
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,660
Bearable, my foot.

236
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:25,970
Hey, this won't do. No matter how much I think about it, I think it'll be better if you receive some treatment.

237
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:29,160
There is Park Clinic in Hwangwon-dong.

238
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:32,570
That place is known among us for being thorough, so go receive treatment there,

239
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:36,850
go home to rest for a day, and then come in tomorrow. I'm giving you permission to leave.

240
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:39,390
- Really? Really, Coach?
 - Yeah.

241
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:43,700
After improving your condition, you should put all your mind into focusing on training. How can you do that with that back?

242
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:46,530
Thank you. I'll receive treatment well, Coach.

243
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:52,090
  Exactly like that, in the same position. She has to go in the same position, yes! Like that! 

244
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:57,620
Comrade Tae Gwon? Comrade Tae Gwon, what's up?

245
00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:00,830
- What are you doing?
 - I'm watching competition videos in my room.

246
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:02,290
What do you want?

247
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:05,530
I mean, I don't have a shift at my part-time job today, so

248
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:08,060
would you like to go see a movie with me?

249
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:11,520
Oh? A movie sounds nice! Wait, Nan Hee went to the canteen, so I'll call her and ask—

250
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,980
  Wait, not with Nan Hee. 

251
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:15,680
Let's just together, the two of us.   (intimate style of speech) 

252
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:18,250
I want to do that.

253
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:31,160
Were you shocked that I asked you to see a movie?

254
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:37,380
No. I think I'm more shocked that you suddenly dropped honorifics.

255
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:40,050
Then, should I use honorifics again?

256
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:44,210
There's no need for that. I'm sure I'll get used to it.

257
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:55,540
- Comrade Tae Gwon!
 - Nan Hee, where have you been?!

258
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:57,600
Hello, Nan Hee.

259
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,040
Thank you.

260
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:10,270
It is said their treatments are good. That heavy and dull pain really disappeared. I'm pain-free now.

261
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:13,630
Is Joon Hyeong finished with training?

262
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:19,100
Still, I should visit home first.

263
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:22,560
Then, I'll call my father.

264
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:30,520
Yeah, Bok Joo.

265
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:35,160
Uncle, it's you? Where's Dad?

266
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:38,940
He's in the bathroom right now. Maybe he has diarrhea, he keeps going in there.

267
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:41,360
Really? What did he eat?

268
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:47,950
Uncle, I got a special day off to receive treatment for my back. If I take a taxi, it'll take around 20 minutes to arrive home.

269
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:51,320
What did you say? You're coming home right now?

270
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:59,520
Y-Yeah, B-Bok Joo, Bok Joo, I put something on the stove. Y-Yeah, hang up for now,  bye.

271
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,980
What should we do? Bok Joo is coming home right now. If she sees what we've taped outside, it's over.

272
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:07,460
What do you mean "what should we do?" We have to go home right now no matter what!

273
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:11,100
You'll get hurt like this! Either way, we're ruined.

274
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:14,150
If Bok Joo takes a taxi, it'll take her 20 minutes. Even if we leave right now, it'll take an hour.

275
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:18,240
Then what should we do? If Bok Joo finds out, she'll bawl and throw a fit!

276
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:22,000
Wait, first of all, let's stay calm. Let's think about this.

277
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,790
Our first priority is to prevent Bok Joo from coming, right? Then the Musketeers.

278
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:27,540
The Musketeers?

279
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:29,140
Should we ask them to block Bok Joo?

280
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:31,250
Yeah, hurry up. Hurry!

281
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:32,700
You have to do it from your phone.

282
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,890
That's right, that's right, yes...

283
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:38,360
 Seizure procedure will begin. 

284
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:44,520
  Excuse me, I'm from a special prosecutor team. Right now,  in the special team, there are a lot of my school juniors. 

285
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,440
 Trust only me  

286
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:50,070
  and just stamp the power of attorney.  

287
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:54,350
  We'll be able to find your money again.  

288
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:03,540
That's so funny!

289
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:16,660
Ugh, this is light.

290
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:36,970
Yes, Bok Joo's Uncle. I'm in the middle of lifting weights, what's the—

291
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:40,410
What?! Bok Joo is?

292
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:44,340
Wow, our house! Bok Chicken!

293
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:46,550
Kim Bok Joo has returned! I have returned.

294
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:50,470
Bok Joo! Bok Joo, Bok Joo, Bok Joo, Bok Joo, Bok Joo!

295
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:52,170
Joon Hyeong!

296
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,540
What? Did you come here because you knew I came? How did you find out?

297
00:21:57,540 --> 00:22:04,190
Huh? I mean, I came to eat chicken at your house but I suddenly saw you.

298
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:10,000
Hey, I guess this is what they call telepathy. I guess we really are a match made in heaven.

299
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,590
Really? That's amazing. Then, let's go in together—

300
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:16,520
Bok Joo, I really missed you.

301
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,490
What's wrong with you, seriously?

302
00:22:19,290 --> 00:22:24,230
Hey, did you do something wrong? Is that why you're over-doing it right now?

303
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:28,020
Hey, what are you talking about? I said I missed you!

304
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:31,940
Hey, let's go! It's been a while since we've met. Let's go eat something delicious.

305
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:34,020
What about your favorite meat? Meat?

306
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:36,150
Okay, let's go after I greet my father—

307
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:41,810
Hey! You can greet him later. I'm hungry right now. I'm starving! Let's go eat meat. I'll treat you!

308
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:45,500
Turn around! Go!

309
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:48,010
Hurry up and go!

310
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:59,620
I don't know why we have to eat chicken from another place when we have our own chicken place, but

311
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:03,460
it's good to know your enemy so let's first eat.

312
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:06,250
Yeah, yeah, yeah, eat up.

313
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:08,690
Now that I look at you, I think you've lost weight.

314
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:10,210
I gained weight.

315
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:14,280
Maybe it's because it's been a while since we've met. Anyway, have you been well, my Fatty?

316
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:17,850
You're asking so quickly. Yeah, what are you going to do if I was well?

317
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:21,270
"What are you going to do?" You're so harsh to your husband you haven't met for a while.

318
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:23,320
Husband, my foot.

319
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:28,370
Hey, be honest. What have you been doing these days?

320
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:31,230
Aren't you going around having fun and flirting with girls just because I'm gone?

321
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:34,480
Hey, am I crazy?! I know that if I'm caught by you, it's death at the very least.

322
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,400
-So you're not?
-Of course not, you rascal!

323
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:57,940
Wait, I have to use the bathroom.

324
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:10,590
Yes, Bok Joo's Uncle. Speak.

325
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:12,230
What happened with Bok Joo?

326
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:15,930
I'm holding onto her, don't worry about anything.

327
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:21,300
Ah, our nephew-in-law, you did great. I think we'll arrive in around 20 minutes

328
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:24,090
so just hold her off for another 30 minutes, alright?

329
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:28,960
Yes, I understand. Don't worry about anything. I'll do my best to hold onto Bok Joo, yes.

330
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,830
Please continue working hard.

331
00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:37,450
Oh, yes. Yes, then I'll hang up. Yes, yes...

332
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:43,750
You said you were going to the bathroom. Why are you taking the phone call here?

333
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:47,910
I felt suffocated so I wanted to breathe in some fresh air.

334
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,080
Who was on the phone?

335
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:57,080
There's just someone. Hey, hey, let's go quickly. Our chicken will cool, come on.

336
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:02,520
Who is it?! Why can't you tell me?

337
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:05,980
I'm not telling you because I can't. Even if I tell you, you won't know who it is.

338
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:09,600
So who is it that I don't know? That person must have a name too, right? Tell me!

339
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:15,810
There just is. Seung...Seung Jin, a friend from high school.

340
00:25:15,810 --> 00:25:21,150
A friend? Do you tell your friend "I'll hang up now" before you hang up? I guess you respect that friend so much.

341
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:26,660
Hey, w-when did I ever do that? You were the one who heard wrong.

342
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:29,780
It's been a while since we've met so why do you keep nitpicking on things since earlier?

343
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:32,930
It's not your friend, is it? It's a woman, isn't it?

344
00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:36,460
Hey, what woman?! Why do you keep suspecting me since earlier?

345
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:40,820
I'm suspecting you because I'm suspicious! Or give me your phone, let me check the name—

346
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:42,120
Hey, what are you doing?

347
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:47,740
Look at you! You have the angry eyes! It's more suspicious.

348
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:49,060
I don't want to!

349
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:51,530
You said that you weren't hiding anything so let me see the name.

350
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:54,680
What's wrong with you, seriously?! Can you not trust me?

351
00:25:56,790 --> 00:26:03,320
Okay, I was too excessive. I became sensitive after receiving training. Let's not fight anymore.

352
00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:09,430
Yeah, why do you keep suspecting me since earlier?

353
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:14,480
I've never even looked at another woman other than you. Trust me.

354
00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:21,760
Hey! Hey! Aren't you going to give that back! Hey!

355
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,150
Give it back to me! Hey!

356
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,780
Hey! Hey!

357
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:31,720
Give it back! Give it back to me!

358
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:36,120
Ugh! Even if we're dating, there's something called "privacy".

359
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:40,340
Inspecting each other's phones is not proper etiquette.

360
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:44,090
Privacy? Etiquette? Wow!

361
00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:48,410
You're so educated! Yeah, since I don't know anything about privacy or etiquette since I'm ignorant, I'll just leave.

362
00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:50,680
Have fun calling with your new girlfriend, okay?!

363
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:54,400
Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey! Hey!

364
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:59,430
Bok Joo! Wait, I have to pay.

365
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:01,320
Hey, Bok Joo! Hey!

366
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,400
Hey, what's wrong with you? Seriously, I said it's not something for you to get mad over.

367
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:06,050
Yeah, this is nothing for me to get mad over but I'm just nitpicking over nothing.

368
00:27:06,050 --> 00:27:09,580
I'm overreacting, I'm overly suspicious, let's just call it that!

369
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:12,320
Hey, how can you speak like that?

370
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:14,230
It's been a while since we've met. Get rid of your anger before you leave.

371
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:18,440
I know. I didn't want to do this because it's been a while since we've met, but I keep getting petty.

372
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:23,320
My back hurts like crap but I was so excited to see you and my Dad. I feel like an idiot now.

373
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:25,900
Jeong Joon Hyeong, I had no idea you would do this to me.

374
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:28,520
Hey. Hey, Kim Bok Joo!

375
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:32,710
Ah, I can't even tell her the truth.

376
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:37,180
Has 30 minutes passed?

377
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:44,400
His affection has cooled, that bastard. In the past, honey dripped from his eyes. It hasn't even been that long since it dropped!

378
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:48,810
Yeah, the world is wide and disgustingly, there are so many pretty girls!

379
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:51,240
Bastard.

380
00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:56,960
Dad! Uncle!

381
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,020
What are you doing, Uncle?

382
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:12,090
Oh, Daughter! You're home! Is your back all better? Did you receive treatment?

383
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:17,500
It's much better since I went to the hospital the Coach recommended. Why are you wearing a mask? Did you catch a cold?

384
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:20,890
Oh, yeah. I'm taking precautions; I don't want to spread my cold to the customers.

385
00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:25,040
Be careful, Father. They say that this year's cold is really vicious.

386
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:29,090
Uncle, why are you sweating so much? Did you just come back from somewhere?

387
00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:34,770
Yeah, you see...maybe it's because I'm getting old, but I keep breaking out into a cold sweat randomly these days.

388
00:28:34,770 --> 00:28:37,290
I guess I'm going into menopause early.

389
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:42,730
It seems like you need to hurry up and get married, Uncle. Uncle, what are you doing?

390
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:43,730
Prevention?

391
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:46,200
Why have you been wiping the fire extinguisher since earlier?

392
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,520
Fire prevention?

393
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,500
-Bok Joo!
-Kim Bok Joo!

394
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:52,930
What is this?! Soon Ok! Nan Hee! Did you two know I was coming?! What is this?!

395
00:28:52,930 --> 00:28:57,720
Yeah, I mean...we came to eat chicken and heard your voice so...

396
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:02,560
Yeah. As expected, the Three Musketeers have some sort of telepathy. Three Musketeers Swag!

397
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,880
Swag...

398
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,900
Why is everyone talking about telepathy?

399
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:10,020
Bok Joo, I missed you!

400
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,430
It's great that you came.

401
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:14,060
Hey, you guys are eating chicken better than I am.

402
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:27,040
Doctor, that person is late tonight. Maybe he can't come because he's too busy.

403
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:30,090
Ah, I-I'm not waiting for him.

404
00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:33,840
I didn't say that you were waiting for him. Then, should we get off of work first?

405
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:37,880
Of course. I'm going to leave soon too. I just have some files I need to find.

406
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,460
Yes.

407
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:52,430
Ah Yeong!

408
00:29:57,660 --> 00:30:01,380
I'm sorry, a seminar suddenly came up.

409
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:05,740
I ran here as fast as I could after it ended but I guess I'm late...

410
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:08,500
I drove really fast because I thought you would wait for me.

411
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,860
I didn't wait for you.

412
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:13,220
I'm just late because my patients got delayed.

413
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:18,060
Really? I was really happy for a moment there...

414
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:19,200
Did you eat?

415
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:23,380
Of course, I did, with the nurses! Do you know what time it is right now?

416
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:25,950
Still, you'll eat again with me, right?

417
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:27,960
I ran all the way here.

418
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:34,010
Yeah, well... Since you spent gas money to come all the way here, I can't just tell you to take a U-turn.

419
00:30:34,010 --> 00:30:35,960
Let's go.

420
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:56,850
Here, eat a lot.

421
00:30:56,850 --> 00:30:59,220
This restaurant is delicious.

422
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:02,640
I stopped eating in the middle of dinner because a patient came.

423
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:06,930
Yeah, so eat up. Who said anything about that?

424
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:12,670
Now that I think about it, I think we've gone to most of the restaurants in this neighborhood, right?

425
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:16,030
I guess. Somehow, that happened.

426
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:20,530
Hey, I need to buy you something more delicious but I don't know this neighborhood well

427
00:31:20,530 --> 00:31:23,790
so I searched for some popular local restaurants on the internet.

428
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:28,520
There's a really popular Osam Bulgogi restaurant near here,

429
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:31,680
and when we go to the suburb, there's a popular Ginseng Chicken Stew restaurant.

430
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:35,280
Chicken legs, chicken legs.

431
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:37,620
Oh, Ssambap! You like Ssambap, right?

432
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:40,470
Wow, Ssambap. Look at the picture, see.

433
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:44,480
What about it? Do you want to challenge this next time?

434
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:49,780
I want to leave.

435
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:53,100
I'm busy. You should finish eating.

436
00:31:55,810 --> 00:31:58,380
Ah Yeong!

437
00:31:58,380 --> 00:31:59,580
Ah Yeong!

438
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:01,410
Just a minute.

439
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,530
- Thank you for the food.
 - Yes, please come back again.

440
00:32:04,530 --> 00:32:06,150
Ah Yeong!

441
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:09,000
Ah Yeong, what's wrong with you?

442
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,170
Did I do something wrong again?

443
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:13,850
Yeah, you did wrong.

444
00:32:13,850 --> 00:32:17,540
I ran all the way here so I could escape from you so that I could get over my feelings for you.

445
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:22,460
These days, I naturally wait for you again whenever night falls.

446
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:26,460
I feel like this disgusting cycle of waiting for you like a sunflower is starting again,

447
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:29,380
so I'm really scared and I hate it.

448
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:34,300
So, don't come again. I won't even be your eating buddy anymore.

449
00:32:41,170 --> 00:32:46,280
I'm lonely in Seoul without you. I don't like it.

450
00:32:48,210 --> 00:32:50,710
So don't tell me not to come again.

451
00:32:56,840 --> 00:33:01,580
The words you just said, w-what do they mean?

452
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:08,180
By any chance, do you like Messi?

453
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:17,340
Are you calling that a proposal?

454
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:19,000
I know, right?

455
00:33:48,450 --> 00:33:50,660
No, no, no, no. No.

456
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:52,970
Aish!

457
00:33:52,970 --> 00:33:56,140
Just get it yourself! You're so lazy!

458
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:58,600
Just stuff your face with this.

459
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:01,140
  Jeong Joon Hyeong 

460
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:05,520
Who is it? Why aren't you picking up?

461
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:08,630
Who is it? Isn't it Joon Hyeong? Why aren't you picking up?

462
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:10,420
I don't know. I don't even want to see him anymore.

463
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:14,210
What? When was it when you two couldn't live without each other? Did you already grow tired of him?

464
00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:17,470
I don't know! I guess men are really all the same.

465
00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:22,030
If you don't stick right next to them to maintain them, they start thinking of other things.

466
00:34:30,350 --> 00:34:32,630
I guess she's really angry.

467
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:37,010
We don't even much time left to meet. Bok Joo, please pick up.

468
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:40,120
  The person you are attempting to reach is not available at the moment— 

469
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:58,030
What are you doing here?

470
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:01,040
Hello, Father.

471
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:07,300
What were you doing in the cold?

472
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:11,030
If she didn't pick up her phone, you should have just left.

473
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:12,930
Thank you for the drink.

474
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:19,260
Father, is your health good?

475
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:22,920
Of course, I'm fine. It's not that I'm dying in one or two days.

476
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:26,600
Why is Bok Joo upset? What did you do wrong?

477
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:31,690
Well, I didn't do anything wrong but she misunderstood something. It's nothing major.

478
00:35:31,690 --> 00:35:33,230
Really?

479
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:37,070
Anyway, thank you for helping us today.

480
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:39,950
- Did you say you swim?
 - Yes.

481
00:35:39,950 --> 00:35:41,280
What place do you usually rank?

482
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:44,270
Recently, I made second place at nationals.

483
00:35:44,990 --> 00:35:47,850
If you're going to rank, you should place first.

484
00:35:47,850 --> 00:35:50,530
What about your parents? Do you have both of your parents?

485
00:35:50,530 --> 00:35:55,190
Yes, both of them run a pharmacy.

486
00:35:57,050 --> 00:35:59,300
To be honest, they're my aunt and uncle.

487
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:06,740
After my father passed away when I was young and my mother remarried, I grew up with my aunt and uncle,

488
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:12,650
but because I grew up with so much love, I grew up well without lacking anything.

489
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:17,220
I've never seen someone who said they grew up well with their own mouth.

490
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:22,460
Putting that aside, what do you like so much about my Bok Joo?

491
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:28,060
She's just... warm.

492
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:33,480
When she's with her friends,

493
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:37,790
when she's with you and her uncle,

494
00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:41,790
and when she weightlifts.

495
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:50,470
Strangely, she has a talent for warming people's hearts. She's always had it since she was young.

496
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:56,850
Well, my Bok Joo is humane because she takes after me.

497
00:36:56,850 --> 00:37:01,310
Goodness, that's right. She takes after you so much, Father.

498
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:06,270
Don't laugh, you rascal! I see right through you.

499
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:09,900
How brash you're.

500
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,070
You rascal.

501
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:21,250
Hey, Bok Joo, go quickly! A national team member shouldn't be like this.

502
00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:22,800
I'm going, I'm going!

503
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,610
Hurry up and go! Finish up your training well and be careful of your back.

504
00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:28,760
Father, make sure your cold heals quickly.

505
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,810
Uncle, do most of the work! You do it, okay?!

506
00:37:30,810 --> 00:37:34,500
Alright, alright! I got it so leave now. How can a national team member be like this?

507
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:37,790
Fine, I'm leaving. You can't wait to send me off, can you? I'll call you soon.

508
00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:39,550
I love you! I love, love you!

509
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:41,940
Yeah, bye! Bye!

510
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:46,180
- Let's go quickly, come on.
 - Yeah.

511
00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:52,370
  Due to a personal situation with the owner, this business is temporarily closed. For emergencies, please contact... 

512
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:56,280
I always prepare my portable charger but always forget to bring it...

513
00:37:58,110 --> 00:38:01,310
What? Why is this business temporarily closed?

514
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:05,540
They were here just a moment ago. Where did those old men go?

515
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:09,510
Goodness, Bok Joo. It's been a while, hasn't it?

516
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:11,160
Hello.

517
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:16,000
Yeah, I heard that you entered Taereung. I guess you stopped by to visit your family.

518
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,330
By the way, has the date for your father's surgery been set? When is it?

519
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:21,900
What? Surgery date?

520
00:38:30,210 --> 00:38:34,440
Ah, I seriously can't live because Bok Joo makes me so uneasy.

521
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:36,980
Why does she keep calling?

522
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:40,280
Yes, our niece. Did you go in safely?

523
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:42,720
 Uncle, where are you right now? 

524
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,850
Where else could I be? I'm at the restaurant.

525
00:38:45,850 --> 00:38:48,760
After you left, the restaurant is empty.

526
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:51,270
 Really? So you're at the restaurant? 

527
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:54,280
Yes, of course, I'm at the restaurant.

528
00:38:55,650 --> 00:38:57,680
Is this the restaurant?

529
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:00,070
Yes, this is the restaurant.

530
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:03,650
But the connection signal is amazing. It's as if she's next—

531
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:25,690
I'm serious. We were planning on telling you after your competition ends, seriously.

532
00:39:25,690 --> 00:39:30,690
I told him not to tell you because I was worried you wouldn't be able to focus.

533
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:34,820
This is your first international competition as a national team member.

534
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:40,770
If you ruined your competition because of me, I felt that would become a regret for the rest of my life

535
00:39:40,770 --> 00:39:44,050
so don't be mad, Bok Joo. Alright?

536
00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:46,580
I'm not mad.

537
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:51,040
When I heard that you had no strength in your voice,

538
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:54,740
when I saw you wearing a mask yesterday, I should have known something.

539
00:39:55,670 --> 00:40:00,910
No matter how much I hide it, you know when I'm upset or where I'm hurting.

540
00:40:01,850 --> 00:40:03,920
I guess I really didn't know anything about you, Father.

541
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:07,600
That's a given because I'm your parent.

542
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,580
Father,

543
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:15,550
I promise I'll do well. I'll get that gold medal

544
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:21,600
and place it around your neck so you have to strengthen up and bear your surgery well too, alright?

545
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:24,070
I believe in you, Father.

546
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:28,980
Yeah, believe in me. Just believe in me.

547
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:36,320
When you receive that gold medal, we need to treat that friend of yours to a proper meal.

548
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:40,710
He helped us with nursing, and he even stalled for time yesterday too.

549
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:42,950
He worked hard.

550
00:40:47,050 --> 00:40:53,310
 Thank you to our Channel Managers: 
 Mychaela &amp; Ladyvillegas  

551
00:40:56,950 --> 00:41:02,100
Hey, Kim Bok Joo! What are you doing here? You didn't return to training?

552
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:06,220
I am the poster child for disbelief. I have no consideration for others and am very close-minded.

553
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:10,080
I'm a loser who doesn't have the right to be Jeong Joon Hyeong's girlfriend!

554
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:13,150
Hey, what are you doing? Are you crazy?

555
00:41:13,790 --> 00:41:17,910
Yeah, I think I've gone crazy. I fell for the Taeneung Unnis' words without ground

556
00:41:17,910 --> 00:41:20,620
when you worked so hard for my father.

557
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:22,450
Joon Hyeong, just hit me! I deserve to be hit!

558
00:41:22,450 --> 00:41:25,420
Hey, don't do that. It hurts.

559
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:28,990
Goodness, none of my work paid off. You found out.

560
00:41:28,990 --> 00:41:34,240
I'm really sorry. I'm uneasy because you're so handsome!

561
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:40,000
Is your face the only thing that's handsome? You're tall, and you have the tsundere personality ( Initially arrogant but warms up ) that women fall for.

562
00:41:41,010 --> 00:41:42,000
And?

563
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,620
Your hands are warm, you're a good swimmer and a good kisser.

564
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:47,410
And?

565
00:41:47,410 --> 00:41:50,580
How much more do you want? I don't have anything left anymore.

566
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:54,040
How did you find out? Did you talk over it with your father?

567
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:59,080
Then let's go. You'll be late. I'll take you to Taereung.

568
00:42:01,950 --> 00:42:07,240
 Thanks to our fantastic English Moderators: 
marykarmelina, msdiamonddiva007 and elyzabethperezb  

569
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:12,130
We're already here. Was Taereung always this close?

570
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:15,880
I know, right? It seemed so far away when I came alone.

571
00:42:16,750 --> 00:42:21,220
Bok Joo, look at me. Look into my eyes.

572
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:25,550
You can see that I've completely fallen for you, right?

573
00:42:25,550 --> 00:42:29,560
I don't know about my life after one million years, but now, I won't ever look at other women

574
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:32,960
so be assured and train, alright?

575
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:39,410
Don't worry about your father's surgery either. In your place, I'll stick right next to him and monitor him in a way that even you can't,

576
00:42:39,410 --> 00:42:41,950
just like your avatar.

577
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:46,190
You trust me, right?

578
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:48,680
Yes, I trust you.

579
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:54,730
Then it's fine. Go in now. Don't think about anything else and just focus during the time left on weightlifting.

580
00:42:54,730 --> 00:42:58,130
If you really fail to bring home gold, I'll just—

581
00:42:58,130 --> 00:42:59,070
Just?

582
00:42:59,070 --> 00:43:01,670
Hug you or something.

583
00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:05,760
So don't be burdened. You have other chances after this too.

584
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:08,170
Alright, you should leave first.

585
00:43:08,170 --> 00:43:10,020
No, go inside first.

586
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:11,300
You should leave first.

587
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:13,950
No, go inside first.

588
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:17,690
Go.

589
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:22,210
Come on, go.

590
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:25,420
What are you doing instead of going? Come on, go.

591
00:43:29,750 --> 00:43:31,940
I'll leave now.

592
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:33,840
Come on, go.

593
00:43:55,490 --> 00:43:57,180
Bye.

594
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:04,690
Breathe in. Get ready...

595
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:11,670
You picked it up well this time. Watch the position of your legs.
 ♬   Will you be spinning in delight?   ♬

00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:09,520
Then we'll treat you all to some ginseng drinks. You should come to the pharmacy some time.

739
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:10,360
Hey.

740
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:14,110
For some reason, it seems as if the in-laws are meeting. Congratulations.

741
00:55:14,110 --> 00:55:16,740
You're not just going to thank me in words, right?

742
00:55:16,740 --> 00:55:17,710
Bok Joo, congratulations.

743
00:55:17,710 --> 00:55:21,620
Doctor, congratulations on setting a wedding date. Doctor, congratulations.

744
00:55:21,620 --> 00:55:25,170
Thank you. If we become sister-in-laws later, please take good care of me.

745
00:55:25,170 --> 00:55:27,080
You know I'm a bit clumsy, right?

746
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:29,010
I don't know, Doctor!

747
00:55:31,670 --> 00:55:34,290
Oh, Joon Hyeong!

748
00:55:34,290 --> 00:55:35,390
Father, the flowers smell nice.

749
00:55:35,390 --> 00:55:36,260
Bok Joo!

750
00:55:36,260 --> 00:55:37,470
Bok Joo, we have to have pictures taken!

751
00:55:37,470 --> 00:55:42,180
Hello, everyone! Today's photographer is the sergeant in his last year, Jo Tae Gwon! 
 ♬   Following the rainbow that comes after the rain   ♬

752
00:55:42,180 --> 00:55:46,050
Now, hello. Hello, hello. Should we start with pictures of Joon Hyeong's family? 
 ♬   we're♬  starting to seach for wonderful days  

753
00:55:46,050 --> 00:55:48,420
Now, now, pictures. Pose!
♬   in our personal heaven   ♬

754
00:55:48,420 --> 00:55:52,010
  One, two, three!  
 ♬   From now on when it gets hard,   ♬

755
00:55:52,010 --> 00:55:59,070
♬   Who cares if we give up when it's hard? We can just take 2 steps forward tomorrow   ♬

756
00:56:03,550 --> 00:56:08,180
Wow, so this is the last time I'll come here.

757
00:56:08,180 --> 00:56:12,140
With the number of coins I threw in there, I could probably buy a hundred fried chickens.

758
00:56:12,140 --> 00:56:18,410
Hey, still, you received everything you wished for. You became a nationalist and got a boyfriend,

759
00:56:18,410 --> 00:56:20,490
a handsome one at that too.

760
00:56:20,490 --> 00:56:22,370
What are you saying?

761
00:56:22,370 --> 00:56:24,420
It's not true?

762
00:56:24,420 --> 00:56:27,580
Fine, it'll be your graduation present. I admit you're handsome.

763
00:56:30,250 --> 00:56:36,490
Wow, all sorts of things happened in four years on this campus.

764
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:39,220
I worked hard to exercise

765
00:56:39,220 --> 00:56:42,920
and I ate a lot with Nan Hee and Soon Ok.

766
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:45,960
You worked hard to date too.

767
00:56:51,550 --> 00:56:55,280
Wow, I feel like I'll really miss this place.

768
00:56:55,280 --> 00:57:00,970
I worked hard to run and worked hard to drag a tire tied to my waist.

769
00:57:00,970 --> 00:57:04,600
What time do you have to enter Taereung tomorrow? Is it possible for you to enter the upcoming competition?

770
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:09,450
Probably. One of my senior's shoulder injury became worse, so I will probably take his place.

771
00:57:09,450 --> 00:57:12,040
Wow, national team member, swag!

772
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:15,550
Hey, do you want to bet to see who wins more medals in the upcoming Tokyo Olympics? What about betting $100? Deal?

773
00:57:15,550 --> 00:57:18,990
Hey, will $100 do? It has to be at least $1,000.

774
00:57:18,990 --> 00:57:24,520
And when this upcoming Olympics ends, I'll probably be more popular than you. Should I give you my autograph now?

775
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:28,520
Goodness, I wish I could just meet you in Japan two years later.

776
00:57:29,850 --> 00:57:31,790
Bok Joo.

777
00:57:33,630 --> 00:57:39,640
If I win a gold medal this time, shall we get married?

778
00:57:40,610 --> 00:57:44,610
I've got pension money. I'll take care of you.

779
00:57:44,610 --> 00:57:46,980
I'll think about it,

780
00:57:46,980 --> 00:57:52,810
but if you want to win a gold medal, don't you have to train even harder? Since we're talking about it, should we run together?

781
00:57:52,810 --> 00:57:56,080
Hey, you want to run together even on our graduation day? I don't want to.

782
00:57:56,080 --> 00:58:00,170
You're slacking off. If you even take a break for a single day, your body will stiffen.

783
00:58:00,170 --> 00:58:03,340
- Let's run.
 - I don't want to.
 - Let's run.

784
00:58:03,340 --> 00:58:05,050
I said I don't want to.

785
00:58:05,910 --> 00:58:08,220
Then I won't get married to you.

786
00:58:08,220 --> 00:58:13,870
Hey, hey! Why won't you get married? If you say that, then I have no choice but to run.

787
00:58:14,540 --> 00:58:18,670
I'm not going to get married! Come on, hurry up!

788
00:58:18,670 --> 00:58:19,930
Try to catch me!

789
00:58:19,930 --> 00:58:25,980
  Everyone has youth. A time that's more beautiful because it's awkward and clumsy, 

790
00:58:25,980 --> 00:58:30,260
  a time that shines brilliantly. 

791
00:58:30,260 --> 00:58:33,420
  A time when you're not afraid of anything because you have nothing to lose 

792
00:58:33,420 --> 00:58:37,220
  and a time when you're excited because you can have anything, everything. That's now, 

793
00:58:38,260 --> 00:58:43,530
  age 24, my youth. Although I'm still uneasy and nervous, 

794
00:58:43,530 --> 00:58:47,060
  I'm perfect without needing anything else. 

795
00:58:47,060 --> 00:58:51,580
♬    I dream of it   ♬

796
00:58:51,580 --> 00:58:57,020
♬   Please let us be eternally happy   ♬

797
00:58:57,020 --> 00:59:01,220
♬   I dream of it   ♬

798
00:59:01,220 --> 00:59:06,400
♬   Please let us have youthful days   ♬
