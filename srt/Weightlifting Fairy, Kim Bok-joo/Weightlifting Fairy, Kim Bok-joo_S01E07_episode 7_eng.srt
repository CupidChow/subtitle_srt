1
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:38,500


2
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:44,550
Song Si Ho, where are you going?

3
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:06,260
Father, why so early in the morning?

4
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:09,770
What going on? Professor? Coach?

5
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:15,140
 Diet Diary 

6
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:17,590
What is this?

7
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,570
I asked what it is, wench!

8
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:25,060
Are your lips glued together? Why can't you speak?!

9
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:27,850
What  exactly is this?!

10
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:29,950
Father...

11
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:33,210
Why are you yelling at her first so scarily?

12
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:36,900
- First listen to what Bok Joo has to say.  
 - Shut up, you bastard!

13
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,850
You stay quiet before I explode!

14
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,900
Why is your name Kim Bok Joo here?!

15
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,730
Father...

16
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:51,340
I heard this place is a clinic  to lose weight.

17
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:53,770
But why is your name here?!

18
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:56,900
Why is your name here, wench?!!

19
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:02,020
- Sunbae, please calm down first.
 - You can't communicate with someone who's gone crazy with words.

20
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:05,920
Father. Father.

21
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:09,820
Come here you, wench!

22
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:13,130
What the heck have you been doing instead of training?

23
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:16,590
- Father, I  did something wrong, Father. Dad...
 - Come here!

24
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:18,910
- You let me go, right now! 
 - Please calm down.

25
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:21,600
Thrashing is the only answer for this little bastard. Come here!

26
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:25,530
Can you calm down. What's going to happen if your blood pressure goes up and you faint?

27
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:28,660
- Do you want to die, you  bastard? 
 - Just kill me instead.

28
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:31,450
-  Hey leave , leave. 
 -  Where are you going, you bastard?!

29
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:34,240
- Come back here!  
 - We will take responsibility for this.

30
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:38,110
Hey! Where are you going, wench?! Come back here.

31
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,840
 Episode 7 
 Happy... Birthday to... 

32
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,990
22.

33
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:06,860
Twenty three.

34
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:10,730
Bok Joo, do it right. Plant your feet firmly!

35
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,960
What in the world were you thinking, going to a place like that?

36
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:18,700
Wait, was it because of curiosity? Or did you just want to try it out one time?

37
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:24,580
If not, was it because you wanted to lose weight so you could be like other girls and walk around wearing skimpy clothes?

38
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:29,530
Bok Joo, you're a weightlifter!

39
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:32,170
I'm saying that you're not just a normal woman.

40
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:38,240
Your father, me, and your coach here. You know how much we've pinned our hopes on you.

41
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:41,300
You stabbed us in the back like this?

42
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:46,390
Even if you increase your weight, it will be not enough in your situation.

43
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:50,930
Are you rebelling? Is it that you don't care whatever will  be?

44
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:56,010
- I'm sorry.
- Do 100 squats! Don't do any tricks but do it right until the end.

45
00:03:56,010 --> 00:04:01,830
We've got to hurry up and gain back all the weight you lost from going to that weight loss clinic or whatever it is!

46
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:04,300
Hold onto the barbell all the way until the end!

47
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,570
I mean, her body is already so pretty.

48
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:10,700
Why would she go there to lose weight?! I'm so disappointed, seriously?

49
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:18,150
What is going on?

50
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:20,640
Has Bok Joo gone completely insane?

51
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:23,560
Why would she go to a weight loss clinic?

52
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,800
It's possible to go out of curiosity!

53
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:30,940
Have you gone insane too? Curiosity, my foot! There are other things to do out of curiosity!

54
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:35,780
How could a weightlifter go to an obesity clinic? Especially one whose dream is to go to the Olympics?

55
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:38,940
Wow, I really don't understand. I don't.

56
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:40,950
Ah, has she been possessed by something?

57
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:44,200
Is it possible that she's belittling her looks because she got rejected by Jeong Joon Hyeong or something?

58
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,780
It's not  that.

59
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:49,700
How do you know if it is or is not?

60
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:54,860
I mean, I'm saying that I don't think she likes him  that  much.

61
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,880
Yes, Mom.

62
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:05,130
Do you think I would have possibly forgotten Hyung's birthday?

63
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:07,630
This evening?

64
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,520
Weren't we supposed to eat together this weekend?

65
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:16,470
Of course, it's a yes for me.

66
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:18,950
Yes, see you later.

67
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:26,280
Ah, that's right. I'm so loyal, too.

68
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:32,070
There's no way I wouldn't give this kind of high-quality information to my Fatty.

69
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:35,910
 Your second present. Today is my hyung's birthday. 

70
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:45,170
Ninety-seven.

71
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:50,410
Ninety-eight.

72
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:58,980
Ninety-nine

73
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,440
One hundred

74
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:17,240
Hey, Bok Joo, take this.

75
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:22,880
Massage your legs right away. You won't be able to train tomorrow if you don't.

76
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:27,670
I don't think that you went to a place like that out of curiosity.

77
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:31,980
The Bok Joo that I know isn't that immature and irresponsible.

78
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:35,390
You love weightlifting more than anyone else, and you've worked so diligently to get here.

79
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,980
So why did you do something so foolish?

80
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:41,890
I am so curious and worried about you.

81
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:45,590
Why did you do that?

82
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:48,530
There's got to be a reason!

83
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:51,470
Why did you go there?

84
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:56,600
Is that place not an obesity clinic?

85
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:00,600
Is it a strange place doing such as multi-level marketing or something by luring the  naive college girls?

86
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,890
No. I'm not like that, Coach.

87
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:06,390
So you are telling me you really went there to lose weight?

88
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,380
So you really are not going to tell me?

89
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:16,590
Wow, I thought that our relationship was deeper than just a coach and her athlete. But I understand now. I've got it.

90
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:22,000
- I'm sorry,  Coach. 
 - Anyway,

91
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,910
we're going to continue the project to increase your weight.

92
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:28,090
So I'm going to be full-on monitoring you from now on, from morning until night.

93
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:31,460
First, you are banned from going out.  If there is an inevitable situation, you can go out only with permission.

94
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:36,670
I'm an advocate of non-violence. But when you break the rules, I'm willing to use corporal punishment.

95
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:39,340
Do you understand?

96
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:55,240
Bok Joo!

97
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:59,290
- Hey!
 - Aish!

98
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:09,410
Ah, just endure it you wench.

99
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:11,130
It'll hurt even more later if we don't massage it now.

100
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:14,370
So why did you go somewhere like that, you crazy wench?!

101
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:19,510
You're so uselessly unflinching.  Why did you do 100 squats so honestly because you're asked to?! That's so foolish!

102
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:23,560
-  Look at how her calves are seizing up.
-  They're seriously stiff!

103
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:26,800
Are you really not going to tell us either? Seriously, why did you keep visiting a place like that?!

104
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,250
Hey, hey! Look at the state she's in. Save it for later.

105
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:33,890
Would she even be in the right state of mind to tell us? It wouldn't even be enough to call 911 with the state she's in.

106
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:37,330
Also, the professor was too much. How could he make her do 100 squats?

107
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:40,090
He probably thought that she would give up in the middle of doing it too.

108
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:44,240
This girl, seriously. It's not like you're going to become a supermodel or something after you lose weight, seriously.

109
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,920
- I'm like this because I'm upset, you wench! 
  - I'm upset too!

110
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,700
Aigoo, seriously. This idiotic woman.

111
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,730
Aigoo, seriously.

112
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:01,290
How far are you going to go Song Si Ho?

113
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:05,040
You really are the worst.

114
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:20,860
Hey! come to your senses!

115
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:28,440
Song Si Ho

116
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:31,240
Doctor...

117
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:39,360
I really want to buy you a glass of beer.

118
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,910
It's a pity, but let's just drink this. Today is my close friend's birthday.

119
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:48,640
Can I gently ask you now why are you angry?

120
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:51,740
It's because of me.

121
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:56,470
I do not like myself. I did something bad to someone.

122
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:01,440
Because of my childish jealousy.

123
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,380
Jealousy is scary.

124
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:09,040
I also caused a huge accident out of jealousy over a man a long time ago.

125
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,920
Is it possible that man that we talked about last time? The one in the love triangle?

126
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,500
It's not even worth calling a love triangle.

127
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,720
I don't know what it is.

128
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:21,080
Don't be too hard on yourself.

129
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:24,660
Alright, let's have a cheer between the two of us Jealous Sisters.

130
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:36,350
Yes?

131
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:39,930
Doctor, Patient Kim Bok Joo isn't picking up her phone.

132
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:41,660
We'll wait for her for a bit longer and then close up for the day.

133
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:43,830
Yes, I understand.

134
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:48,750
She's not someone who wouldn't come without notifying me of it beforehand.

135
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:57,200
Mm, this is delicious. As expected, food you eat after paying for it is the best.

136
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,430
Of course. Imagine if I had cooked this. It wouldn't have tasted like this.

137
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:03,080
I would have worked hard for nothing and be irritated when it's time to clean up.

138
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:06,790
I like this too. I had seaweed soup in the morning.

139
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:08,930
This is good.

140
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:10,600
Yeah, Ah Yeong.

141
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:14,630
Hey, where are you? I'm in front of your hospital right now, but it seems you've already gotten off of work.

142
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:18,170
Yeah, I left early. You should have called me beforehand.

143
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:22,080
Where are you? At your birthday party? Can't we meet for a few minutes?

144
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,030
I'm eating with my family right now.

145
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:26,200
Hey, who is it? Tell them to come here.

146
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,840
- Yeah.
 - We're fine, tell them to come.

147
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,520
It's a girl.

148
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:35,630
Can you come for a minute?

149
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:42,500
"Ah Yeong, Ah Yeong," I heard your name all the time but I'm only meeting you now.

150
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,910
Oh, you're so pretty.

151
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:48,410
No, Mother. You're much prettier.

152
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,370
Why is the atmosphere like this, seriously?

153
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:54,910
What? Your mother is pretty.

154
00:11:54,910 --> 00:12:01,250
She has pretty skin, pretty skin, pretty skin, and...

155
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:03,570
Only her skin is pretty.

156
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:05,880
Ugh, seriously. Mr. Jeong Chang Hyung!

157
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,430
Father, you're so funny.

158
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:12,260
Jae Yi and Joon Hyeong, I wondered how brothers could be so different,

159
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:15,370
but I guess that's because Joon Hyeong takes after you, Father.

160
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:24,070
Let's talk while we eat. Mom, Dad, have some of this.

161
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:26,010
By the way,

162
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:29,740
your friend flaked without even a call. Don't you know anything?

163
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:31,720
Bok Joo?

164
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:34,750
There's no way she would do that. Did you try calling her?

165
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:39,120
She didn't pick up. Is she busy practicing the cello?

166
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,200
Now that I think about it, she didn't respond to my texts either.

167
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:57,050
I'm sorry. You were really uncomfortable earlier, weren't you?

168
00:12:57,050 --> 00:13:00,820
No. It was fun. Both your mother and father are great people.

169
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:04,840
I guess my mom feels rushed. She doesn't bring up the topic and pressure me,

170
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:09,410
but it seems she investigates whenever a young female customer comes to her pharmacy.

171
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:11,260
She's just doing that out of habit, so don't—

172
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:16,140
Alright, I got it. Did anyone say something? Your defense against girls is something else.

173
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:19,360
Hey, mothers of people our age are all like that.

174
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:25,920
My mom tries to set me up with my sunbaes, colleagues, and random men that she picks up off the street so that I can marry one of them.

175
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:30,730
You just have to take it as it is. Why are you getting all serious about that? It's upsetting.

176
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:33,790
Hey, when did I become serious?

177
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:35,980
Are you scared I might think of something else?

178
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:38,610
That I might suddenly put my mind to it and be direct?

179
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:42,350
Ah, that's not what I mean. I thought that you really might have been uncomfortable—

180
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:45,010
I'm even more uncomfortable because of you.

181
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:47,760
Now that I look at you, you really have Prince Disease.

182
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,140
I'm leaving now, friend.

183
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:52,930
Ah Yeong.

184
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,910
Happy Birthday.

185
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,650
Ah, seriously...

186
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:27,300
Kim Bok Joo, there's no way she wouldn't have gone when she knew it was my brother's birthday.

187
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:37,800
  The person you are attempting to reach is not available at the moment— 

188
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,320
She's even ignoring my calls.

189
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:45,170
Did something really happen?

190
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:51,310
  Bok Chicken 

191
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:53,680
Is she not here?

192
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:01,290
Um, hello.

193
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,370
Oh, you're that weasel-looking abalone guy.

194
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:06,710
- Pardon?
 - What do you want?

195
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:10,370
By any chance, is Bok Joo home right now? She wasn't answering her phone.

196
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:13,110
It's not that she's not picking up, she probably can't.

197
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:15,700
She caused some trouble so she's under extreme surveillance.

198
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,940
What trouble?

199
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:19,900
Come here.

200
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:26,940
- You have to keep this secret, alright? I'm only telling you this because you're her friend. 
 - Yes.

201
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:34,330
Bok Jo went to some obesity clinic or something and got caught. There was a huge commotion.

202
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:38,760
The professor and the coach barged in, and her father raised a wooden club out of anger.

203
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:41,840
I barely stopped him from beating her to death.

204
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:48,130
Bok Joo's father, that old man is hot-tempered, so he can't see anything once he gets angry.

205
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:54,140
Even his nickname was a  rabid dog  when he was an athlete, a sick, crazy dog.

206
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:04,230
How did you get caught?

207
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:07,490
Anyway, you're quite sloppy, Kim Bok Joo.

208
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,570
 Obesity clinic appointment
Texts from Jeong Joon Hyeong 

209
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:47,260
  Jeong Joon Hyeong 

210
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:51,320
  The second present: It's my hyung's birthday today. 

211
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,320
  Are you okay? 

212
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:47,240
Hey, are you kidding me right now?!

213
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,930
If you don't want to eat four servings, pile more on.

214
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:57,160
One more serving.

215
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:02,150
What? After you visited a place to lose weight, you can't swallow any more food because it tastes like poison?

216
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:06,250
You usually ate 2-3 servings of this food. Are you not going to raise your weight class?!

217
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:09,450
No, I'll be back.

218
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,940
Oh, the weightlifters are there!

219
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,940
Why is the atmosphere like that? Oh...

220
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:30,510
The atmosphere is no more scary than a scary-edition program in the summer time. Even Coach adds...

221
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:34,260
She's under proper surveillance.

222
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:39,340
You gained 0.53 kg.

223
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:45,310
If you lose 0.01 kg from here, then you'll go into an issue ordered weight gain program.

224
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:48,310
So do whatever you can to maintain your current weight, whether it's eating ramyun at night or something else.

225
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:52,090
Three sets of 20 squats, start.

226
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:53,920
Yes.

227
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:57,140
Woon Gi, come here.

228
00:18:57,790 --> 00:18:59,370
- Hello.
 - Hello.

229
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:00,550
Hello.

230
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:02,950
Didn't training start 30 minutes ago? Huh?

231
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:05,340
- Where did everyone go? Captain.
 - Yes, Professor?

232
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:08,750
Isn't it time for you all to be stretching right now? Where did everyone run off to?

233
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,840
I'll call them in right now, Professor.

234
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,860
These rascals, seriously.

235
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:15,520
Since I let you off with everything, you're slacking off.

236
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:19,310
Hey, are you going to manage the kids in this manner?

237
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,030
- Hyeong Woo.
 - Yes.

238
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:24,760
Did you have the x-ray taken of your knee, like I told you to last time?

239
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:27,400
It got better so I was planning to have it taken  after the upcoming competition...

240
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,440
After the competition, when?! Huh?!

241
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,900
If your knee is ruined, will you have it taken only after you're forced to quit weightlifting?!

242
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:37,700
What's the use of repeating this to you for 100 days? Only my mouth would be  hurting.

243
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:42,290
You pathetic fools... I'm so upset, ugh!

244
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:52,080
Why is the weightlifting department's atmosphere like this?

245
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,360
Kim Bok Joo, I heard you caused trouble again.

246
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,090
Didn't the professor yell at us because of you?

247
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:59,960
Hey, what ridiculous thing did you do now?

248
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,980
Did you get drunk and cause a scene?

249
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:02,830
No.

250
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:05,520
Please, Ms. Bok Joo, let's live quietly.

251
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:09,550
My head already hurts enough because of my uneasy future.

252
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:11,940
I beg of you, come on, please.

253
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:14,880
- Ugh, my back.
 - She got drunk and caused a scene.

254
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:24,840
Yes, Uncle.

255
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:35,030
It seems like a life or death situation really happened.

256
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:37,610
I got involved for no reason and I'm getting worried about her.

257
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:43,170
Are you okay or what?

258
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:51,340
- H—
 - Hey, Bok Joo! Let's go together.

259
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,640
What the heck? Don't you see me?

260
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:59,520
Where are you rushing off to again, Kim Bok Joo?

261
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,400
She is really busy.

262
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:10,610
Oh, you're here?

263
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:13,610
Is Father inside?

264
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:15,510
What's wrong with your eyes, Uncle?

265
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:19,060
I am really sick of that human's sulking, huh.

266
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:23,970
Saying what's the point getting dialysis when he's looked down on by his daughter, he threw a tantrum this early in the morning.

267
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:28,110
I kept on insisting that he go to dialysis, so I got beat up.

268
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:32,500
Please wait here a moment, Coach.

269
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:45,850
Father.

270
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:53,600
Get up and go to the hospital. What will you do  when you have a hard time?

271
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:57,200
Father.

272
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:01,940
What do you care, you brat?  Do you even pay attention to your father, you brat?

273
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:05,100
Don't worry about whether I die or not in this way.

274
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:08,170
I almost died because of the hospital expenses anyway, so it turned out well!

275
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:13,800
When I die, you can go to that obesity clinic or something with the donation money for funeral expenses.

276
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:17,340
Is that something that you should say to your daughter?

277
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:21,990
No matter how wrong I was, it's not right to make a protest against going to the hospital!

278
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:23,800
How am I, who went to that obesity clinic, different

279
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,630
from Father who persists in not going to the hospital?

280
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:29,940
What? What did you do that was so right?!

281
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:36,890
Lead the way, you rascal! Where is that clinic? It's the one at the four-way intersection, isn't it?!

282
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:39,890
This bastard doctor, seducing young girls.

283
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:43,640
He just extorts money. Vermin-like bastard!

284
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:48,190
Father. Father! Father!

285
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:53,120
I can't live in peace because of that father and daughter.

286
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:59,060
What about it?  Do you want to drink a bottle of coke? It'll probably be so strong it'll make your insides explode.

287
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:01,530
I don't drink carbonated beverages on an empty stomach.

288
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:03,550
Ah, I see.

289
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:18,290
Seriously, you're really worrisome.

290
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:33,060
No, Dad! You can't, Dad! Father, father.

291
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:35,140
What do you mean, I can't?! Can't do what?!

292
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:38,850
Whether it's a clinic or a hospital,  not to make money again,

293
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:41,330
I'll break it down!

294
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:42,940
Father, Father!

295
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:47,270
No, you can't, Father! You can't, Dad. You can't go there!

296
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:49,320
Won't you let go? Let me go!

297
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:53,010
You've done nothing wrong. This is all that doctor's fault for only thinking about money!

298
00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:58,870
How much did they lure a girl who knows only sports so she went there with all her petty pennies?

299
00:23:58,870 --> 00:23:59,910
Let me go, you brat!

300
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:02,550
No, I'm the one who went there, seriously!

301
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:06,160
Father, please. I won't go there again. I won't even step foot near it, please.

302
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,190
Shut up, you little—

303
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:11,960
Dad! Dad, are you okay?!

304
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:14,390
Hey, Bok Joo! Call a taxi, quickly!

305
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:16,100
I'll call one. I'll do it.

306
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:21,090
Dad, I was wrong! Get up, hurry!

307
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:25,530
Dad! Dad!

308
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:33,190
And, up!

309
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:41,360
You're shaky. Song Shi Ho, are you going to keep being like this?

310
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,910
What are you going to do when you can't do a pivoting scene?

311
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:46,980
Will you be able to participate in the match tomorrow like this?

312
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,630
Do it again.

313
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:01,370
I'm going to go crazy, seriously.

314
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:03,970
Why has your balance gotten so bad?

315
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:06,720
You're interrupting the flow all over the place. Seriously.

316
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:20,830


317
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:31,870
It's okay. He's gone to dialysis right now, so he'll be okay. Go practice.

318
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:33,190
But still, Uncle—

319
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:36,340
It's okay. It's going to take a few hours.

320
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:39,660
Coach, please take her and quickly head back in.

321
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:43,660
You suffered a lot because of us, Coach.

322
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:45,540
No, it's okay.

323
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:52,120
You must have been shocked. Drink up.

324
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,830
Thank you.

325
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:56,600
It's natural for your father to act that way.

326
00:25:56,600 --> 00:26:01,080
He has spent all his life by looking only at you and supporting you.

327
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:03,930
Hey, you have to be good to your father.

328
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:05,930
I know.

329
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:10,190
Wait a second.

330
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:13,640
Yes, this is Coach Choi.

331
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:18,080
I submitted the expense breakdowns and receipts after a  training trip.

332
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,380
The total doesn't match it?

333
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:24,830
Yes, I'll go and check right now. Yes.

334
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:27,460
Hey, I have to go to the administration office right now.

335
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:30,600
Drink this and go to the practice room to do sets.

336
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:34,610
- When you arrive, Woon Gi will be there. Go right away.
- Yes.

337
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:11,140
Hey, Woon Gi! Where did Bok Joo go? Why are you practicing alone?

338
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:15,130
Bok Joo never came. Didn't she leave with you?

339
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:20,360
No matter how much I think about it, it's a mystery.

340
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:26,190
I'm talking about Bok Joo. She's raising her weight class, and she's never been interested in losing weight.

341
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:31,740
Thinking about it again, it's all lie about her hemorrhoids. With that excuse, she must have gone there.

342
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:38,780
Why in the world did she do that? Hey, can't you think of anything?

343
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:41,650
Of course I can't. How would I?

344
00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:44,640
I'm telling you, something just doesn't feel right.

345
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:50,860
I thought that I knew Bok Joo really well. It's upsetting that she completely fooled us too.

346
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:54,360
Bok Joo must have had her own circumstances.

347
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:58,780
So that's why I'm asking what they were? I can't even guess what they are!

348
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:04,490
Hey, honestly, why is Bok Joo going to an obesity clinic such a huge sin? We're the ones sinning by being weightlifters.

349
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:08,500
Hey, why is being a weightlifter a sin?!

350
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,950
Yes, Coach?

351
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:13,860
Bok Joo? She's not in her room right now.

352
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:16,490
Isn't she training right now?

353
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:29,550
 Doctor, did you have a good birthday yesterday? 

354
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:37,690
 I think that I won't be able to see you anymore. 

355
00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:40,630
♬  I've been hesitating for a long time  ♬

356
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:44,100
 If I would have been honest with you from the very beginning, 

357
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:48,310
 would I have been able to wish you a happy birthday face to face? 

358
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:54,080
♬  As the time approaches  ♬

359
00:28:54,080 --> 00:29:00,280
 I am Kim Bok Joo, a sophomore at Haneul Sports University and a weightlifter. 

360
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:04,100
 When I was young, I was sometimes called  "Champ of Korean Wrestlers." 

361
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:08,910
 And I like Big Bang more than classical music. 

362
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:15,230
 I really like sausage. I like exercising early in the morning in the winter. 

363
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:19,060
 I like the smell of the ground on rainy days. 

364
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:26,830
 And... I like you, Doctor. 

365
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:34,540
♬  Without being aware we are on the edge of the road.  ♬

366
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:45,540
♬  I dream of it. Please let us be eternally happy.  ♬

367
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:47,500
 It's okay. 

368
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:53,530
 I've always been stupid and simple, so I can forget you really quickly. 

369
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:59,590
 I'll just be upset for today. 

370
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:08,440
 Doctor.  It's late, but happy birthday. 

371
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:17,770
♬  I dream of it.  Please let the days we smile be more  ♬

372
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:26,640
♬  than the days drenched in tears  ♬

373
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:33,590
 It's a day late, but happy birthday to you. 

374
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:54,490
Oh, Jeong Joon Hyeong.

375
00:30:54,490 --> 00:30:57,430
Wow. Wow, you finally answered.

376
00:30:57,430 --> 00:31:00,650
Hey, why is it so hard to talk with you on the phone even once?

377
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,780
Yeah, why?

378
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:05,970
What do you mean, why?

379
00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:07,730
Are you okay?

380
00:31:07,730 --> 00:31:12,400
Your coach completely attaches herself to you lately. Are you surviving?

381
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:16,680
Yeah. But how did you know?

382
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:19,230
Bok Joo!

383
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:21,710
Oh, you wench!

384
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:32,740
H-Hello? Hey, Fatty! You hung...

385
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:35,580
Ah, she hung up. Man.

386
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:40,230
Ah, what now? What's going on?

387
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:43,960
I'm asking you, Kim Bok Joo!

388
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:47,440
I asked you where you went!

389
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:49,850
To go take care of something.

390
00:31:49,850 --> 00:31:53,230
I told you to practice, but did I tell you to go and take care of something personal?

391
00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:55,570
I'm telling you to at least give me an explanation!

392
00:31:55,570 --> 00:31:58,480
What did you have to do that was so urgent?

393
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:03,930
You're keeping your silence again? You're saying that you're not going to talk to me?

394
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:05,490
Okay, fine.

395
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:09,390
I definitely warned you that I was going to give you corporal punishment.

396
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:32,900
I'm going to hit you twenty times. Make sure you count it right.

397
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,420
One.

398
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:40,310
Two.

399
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:44,920
Ah, Coach! Coach, Coach.

400
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:49,850
Ah, Coach! I'll tell you. I'll do it.

401
00:32:50,810 --> 00:32:52,710
Nan Hee!

402
00:32:55,520 --> 00:33:00,910
That's why she went there. It's not because her goal was to lose weight.

403
00:33:00,910 --> 00:33:04,060
Today, when I held her back and asked her about it earlier,

404
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:07,050
she said that she just went to leave a present for the doctor

405
00:33:07,050 --> 00:33:09,830
at the obesity clinic because yesterday was his birthday.

406
00:33:11,770 --> 00:33:16,600
You know that it's Bok Joo's first time feeling this way, Coach.

407
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:22,370
You know that people can't get over their feelings like they want to.

408
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:35,010
When I was 19,  I ran away from home once.

409
00:33:35,010 --> 00:33:37,650
A neighborhood oppa and I fell for each other.

410
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:42,730
After eating a meal and watching the night sea, he said we had to go home

411
00:33:42,810 --> 00:33:44,710
because he didn't want to get beaten to death.

412
00:33:44,810 --> 00:33:50,310
Seriously. I risked my life and followed him, giving up weightlifting and everything.

413
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:58,440
But do you know what bothered me more than feeling betrayed?

414
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:06,130
I kept on thinking about that hateful oppa.

415
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:10,510
I guess all women feel that way.

416
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:15,430
Once we give our hearts, it's hard for us to take them back, to the point that we become foolish.

417
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:22,140
Hey, Bok Joo. Hey.

418
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:25,700
You feel like you're going to die,  burning your insides right now, don't you?

419
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:31,630
It's okay. It'll all pass.

420
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:34,260
Do you know the ultimate point when you exercise?

421
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:38,130
Your breath gets trapped inside of you all the way up to your chin and you feel like you'll die.

422
00:34:38,130 --> 00:34:40,980
But it's bearable once you just get past that point.

423
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:44,500
Everything's like that.

424
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:47,640
Coach...

425
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:55,030
Hey, it's okay to be like this once.

426
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:57,140
Later on, or even now,

427
00:34:57,140 --> 00:35:01,370
meet a man who will see you and love you just the way you are.

428
00:35:01,370 --> 00:35:04,920
Hey, can't female weightlifters date either?

429
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:07,430
They can. I won't stop you.

430
00:35:08,310 --> 00:35:11,080
Coachnim.

431
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:19,800
Ah, this rascal. Hey.

432
00:35:24,810 --> 00:35:28,130
Ah, where did she go after hanging the phone up like that?

433
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:29,610
She's not in the weightlifting room either.

434
00:35:29,610 --> 00:35:33,530
Who is that bastard?! Who's the bastard that made our Bok Joo cry?!

435
00:35:33,530 --> 00:35:37,010
I won't leave you alone for bothering our Bok Joo!

436
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:38,480
Coach...

437
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:41,530
Bok Joo, it's okay. Alright?

438
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:43,270
It'll all get better after you cry.

439
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:45,830
Coach...

440
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:57,550
I'll tell the head resident for you, so sleep at home tonight.

441
00:35:57,550 --> 00:36:02,510
Calm your heart down, and butter up your dad as well.

442
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:05,710
Coach.

443
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:09,570
From tomorrow, you have to practice hard again. I'll be tough.

444
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:14,570
What was it, that "swag" or whatever? Find that again.

445
00:36:14,570 --> 00:36:17,850
Yes, ma'am. Thank you, Coach.

446
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:19,730
Go.

447
00:36:21,010 --> 00:36:23,200
Go, quickly!

448
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:28,110
So you also do a thing like a lonely love.

449
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:35,750
Everyone is clumsy when it comes to love.

450
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:43,840
Oh.

451
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,450
You're getting off work now?

452
00:36:46,450 --> 00:36:48,970
Yeah. What about Bok Joo?

453
00:36:50,530 --> 00:36:53,800
Don't worry too much about her. She's going to work hard.

454
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:57,380
You said that believing in someone is supporting them. Let's support her. She's our star athlete.

455
00:36:57,380 --> 00:37:01,540
Alright. Believing in something that you can't see is real faith.

456
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:05,070
If not wavering, will a flower bloom?

457
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:06,770
You hurry up and head home too, Coach Choi.

458
00:37:06,770 --> 00:37:10,170
Yes, sir. Be safe on your way home and make sure you eat dinner.

459
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:13,410
Aigoo, are you my wife or something?

460
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:21,500
Wow, you're a true poet, Professor.

461
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:56,130
I caught you, Kim Bok Joo!

462
00:37:56,130 --> 00:37:59,110
What the heck, Jeong Joon Hyeong?

463
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:01,940
As expected, the best way to catch you is with sausage.

464
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:06,970
Since you're always going around chewing on it, I bought some. It's not really that good, though.

465
00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:09,890
Here. Where are you going?

466
00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:12,870
Home. I got a special night out. You?

467
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:17,030
Me? I ended up coming this way after going to buy sausage.

468
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:21,540
Hey, how could you hang up like that and then not give me a single call back?

469
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:24,480
Things just turned out that way.

470
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,740
But seriously, how did you know that I got caught?

471
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:29,540
I've got my ways of finding everything out.

472
00:38:31,870 --> 00:38:34,650
Let's go! You didn't eat dinner, right?

473
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:36,050
How about your night attendance?

474
00:38:36,050 --> 00:38:40,350
Do you think  the demerit points exist in vain? They exist  for us to receive them.

475
00:38:40,350 --> 00:38:43,110
Hey. Let me go!

476
00:38:43,110 --> 00:38:45,470
What are we going to eat?

477
00:38:48,770 --> 00:38:51,740
Ah, Lee Soon Ok, why are you acting like that? Stop being mad.

478
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:53,950
You knew that Bok Joo was going there.

479
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:56,410
It's not like I knew from the beginning either, though.

480
00:38:56,410 --> 00:39:00,670
But you  did  know first either way. It's no wonder I thought that you were being too calm.

481
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:03,640
Normally you would have thrown a fit and overreacted.

482
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:06,260
No, I was just hesitating on whether I should tell you or not.

483
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:09,020
What's the reason that you can know when I shouldn't?

484
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:10,070
It's not like that!

485
00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:13,550
Forget it! You're worse than Bok Joo!

486
00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:15,580
Oh, you wench!

487
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:18,580
Lee Seon Ok, swag!

488
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:22,140
Aish, it hurts.

489
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:27,770
Bok Joo, it's meat! It's the meat that you love so much!

490
00:39:27,770 --> 00:39:31,670
It's the meat that'll go into our Bok Joo's mouth!

491
00:39:32,910 --> 00:39:36,950
What's with you? Why are you treating me so well? You're even buying the meat.

492
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:40,870
I told you that I picked up a 50,000 won bill off the ground earlier. You've got to spend that kind of money quickly.

493
00:39:40,870 --> 00:39:43,110
Alright, hurry up and eat!

494
00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:45,010
Man, I really don't have an appetite, though.

495
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:48,710
Here! Bok Joo, say ah!

496
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:52,330
The meat is heading toward Bok Joo!

497
00:39:52,330 --> 00:39:54,370
Bok Joo, say ah!

498
00:39:54,370 --> 00:39:57,650
Here! Hurry up and eat.

499
00:39:58,510 --> 00:40:01,770
Eat a lot. Think of it as me spending Hyung's birthday money in his place.

500
00:40:01,770 --> 00:40:04,800
If it's like this, there's no need for you to diet.

501
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:14,950
Aigoo, that's why you should have been careful! How could you get caught, and on Hyung's birthday at that?

502
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:21,510
Hey, hey, hey. Hyung was worried about you too because you didn't call him even once.

503
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:22,600
Really?

504
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:25,210
That's right. You should at least call him.

505
00:40:26,010 --> 00:40:29,050
You probably wouldn't be in the right mental state to do that, though.

506
00:40:35,010 --> 00:40:40,060
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! That isn't cooked yet! Spit it out, spit it out, come on.

507
00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:46,420
Ugh, hey, come here. You got sauce on your sleeve.

508
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:50,040
Ugh. I just can't live because of you.

509
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:54,620
It's cooked. Go on, eat.

510
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:03,480
Don't leave any of this, eat everything. Let's fill out stomachs and go empty our brains.

511
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:06,500
I'll treat you a full course in celebration of your special permission to go out.

512
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,390
This old man, you can't drink. Something bad could really happen.

513
00:41:09,390 --> 00:41:12,310
Give it to me. A few shots is fine.

514
00:41:12,310 --> 00:41:17,250
You've already had multiple shots. If this continues, you'll swell and there'll be chaos.

515
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:28,310
Just finish that.

516
00:41:28,310 --> 00:41:31,100
You cute bastard.

517
00:41:40,310 --> 00:41:44,510
You don't feel good after doing that to Bok Joo too, right?

518
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:51,440
Hyung, think about it. Bok Joo is 21, 20 in international age.

519
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:57,220
At her age, girls are putting on makeup, losing weight, and dating. Why wouldn't she want to do that either?

520
00:41:57,220 --> 00:41:59,110
Is she not a girl?

521
00:41:59,110 --> 00:42:01,480
Is she a girl? She's a weightlifter.

522
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:05,050
A weightlifter is also a girl! Then is she a man?

523
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:09,950
To be honest, whenever I look at Bok Joo,

524
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:14,280
my heart clenches up and I pity her to death.

525
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:18,160
She's always wearing sweatpants, riding the scooter, and delivering chicken.

526
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:22,040
Her hands are cracked and dry, like a turtle.

527
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:25,350
Is that a lady's hand, huh?

528
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:30,560
Her mother passed away early,

529
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:33,650
and her ignorant father beats her for small infractions—

530
00:42:33,650 --> 00:42:37,590
Be quiet. If you're going to talk nonsense, just go sleep.

531
00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:42,270
I was planning to do that anyway. You can't drink any more than this, alright?

532
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:52,100
Who doesn't know that she's pitiful?

533
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:56,730
That's why she needs to see it to the end.

534
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:03,130
I should at least wrap a damn gold medal around her hand

535
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:08,820
if she doesn't want that to remain a regret for the rest of her life, like me.

536
00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:14,990
Oh... you've really gotten into dancing.

537
00:43:14,990 --> 00:43:17,100
You'll become a dancer if you get good at it.

538
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:21,290
I know, right? I thought it wasn't my style but the club is unexpectedly fine.

539
00:43:21,290 --> 00:43:23,680
To pay for clubbing next time, rock-paper-scissor-shoo!

540
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:27,860
- Ah!
 - You lost. You have to pay for clubbing next time.

541
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:32,360
Why am I so bad at rock-paper-scissor-shoo? Even when I play with my teammates, I always lose.

542
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:35,540
Hey, but how did you get caught by your teammates?

543
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:39,620
The coach said she picked up my clinic record book in the weightlifting room.

544
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:44,590
Hey, why would you— Ugh, you're so careless.

545
00:43:44,590 --> 00:43:47,190
I'm sure I placed it safely in the bottom of my bag.

546
00:43:47,190 --> 00:43:50,410
I don't know why that fell there. It's really a mystery.

547
00:43:50,410 --> 00:43:53,830
Hey, you must have dropped it. Would a ghost have placed it there?

548
00:43:53,830 --> 00:43:59,010
I know, right? The water has already been spilled. How it spilled isn't important now.

549
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:05,030
But... I don't regret it.

550
00:44:05,890 --> 00:44:09,400
Thanks to the doctor, I learned many things.

551
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:13,270
I learned that I'm a woman,

552
00:44:13,270 --> 00:44:18,430
that my heart can also pound because of a man, not only because of weightlifting.

553
00:44:23,470 --> 00:44:27,390
That I can dance crazily, like this.

554
00:44:27,390 --> 00:44:31,120
Ugh, my emotions were about to explode. You ruined it, ugh.

555
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,800
Hey, will your unexcused staying-out really be okay?

556
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:38,430
For me... I'm originally a habitual offender...

557
00:44:38,430 --> 00:44:41,160
What? Are you worried?

558
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:45,500
Of course I'm worried! You're about to get caught because of me, how can I not be worried?

559
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:47,950
Oh, you're so nice, Kim Bok Joo.

560
00:44:47,950 --> 00:44:51,520
Hey, don't initiate skinship with me so slyly.

561
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:53,200
What? Who cares if I do?

562
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:56,230
Aish, this bastard. Do I have to make you see stars for you to come back to your senses?

563
00:44:57,130 --> 00:44:59,620
Now you're back.

564
00:44:59,620 --> 00:45:05,430
Cheer up, you rascal. Threatening me is your charm but since you're docile, it's a turn-off.

565
00:45:06,070 --> 00:45:09,130
Whenever you want to uplift your mood, call me.

566
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:13,130
I'll aggravate you!

567
00:45:21,390 --> 00:45:26,020
Hey, since you got permission, go in through the front. I have to enter through the back.

568
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:28,090
Take care on the way back.

569
00:45:31,910 --> 00:45:33,450
Hey.

570
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:38,880
Today was fun... thanks to you.

571
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:47,130
I had fun today too... thanks to you.

572
00:45:56,320 --> 00:46:01,190
  The Coach said she picked up my clinic record book in the weightlifting room. 

573
00:46:03,430 --> 00:46:06,150
  Weightlifing Department 

574
00:46:21,770 --> 00:46:25,890
Jeez, Jeong Joon Hyeong. Acting like that doesn't suit him.

575
00:46:25,890 --> 00:46:30,550
Well, I guess you can't defy blood.

576
00:46:30,550 --> 00:46:35,920
He resembles the doctor a   little , just a little.

577
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:02,260
- You're up early, Unni.
 - Yeah,

578
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:04,310
I have a competition today.

579
00:47:04,310 --> 00:47:07,290
You said you were going to visit your house. You came back early.

580
00:47:07,290 --> 00:47:10,540
Yes, I woke up early.

581
00:47:11,990 --> 00:47:15,260
Is your body alright?

582
00:47:15,260 --> 00:47:18,040
It didn't look good yesterday.

583
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:23,930
Yeah, I'm okay. I've always had the stamina of steel. Thank you for worrying about me.

584
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:27,630
I hope your match goes well today too, Unni. Good luck.

585
00:47:27,630 --> 00:47:30,810
Then I'm going to get some shut-eye for a little while.

586
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:49,670
What is this?

587
00:47:49,670 --> 00:47:52,210
I don't know. 
 - What do you mean don't know?

588
00:47:56,710 --> 00:47:59,570
- That's not it, it's not.
 - Oh, I'm so tired!

589
00:47:59,570 --> 00:48:01,920
- Ouch.
 - You can't do that.

590
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:05,270
Aish, you should have woken me up! How can you guys just leave by yourselves! How cheap!

591
00:48:05,270 --> 00:48:08,230
We didn't think that you'd come out before the run started, either.

592
00:48:11,190 --> 00:48:12,750
What is it?!

593
00:48:13,530 --> 00:48:16,040
Soon Ok, that wench, is really upset.

594
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:18,840
Because I knew about your thing first,

595
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:22,560
she said that we made her an outcast. Ugh, things are really twisted right now.

596
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:25,280
Aish, that's not it.

597
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:26,930
What do we do?

598
00:48:26,930 --> 00:48:32,190
Once she gets upset, it's impossible to talk to her. She's so stubborn.

599
00:48:32,190 --> 00:48:34,380
I'm the sinner.

600
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:37,720
 Father. 

601
00:48:51,020 --> 00:48:53,130
I'm here, Dad.

602
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:57,510
I told you to come whenever you had time. Why are you visiting me first thing in the morning? What about breakfast?

603
00:48:57,510 --> 00:49:01,730
I ate two servings already. The coach said she would buy me some pork hocks later, too.

604
00:49:05,030 --> 00:49:06,880
It's okay,  I will do it.

605
00:49:14,110 --> 00:49:18,470
Are you feeling okay? Didn't you go to dialysis too late yesterday?

606
00:49:18,470 --> 00:49:20,750
Don't even pretend to be worried, you rascal.

607
00:49:20,750 --> 00:49:25,120
Someone who's so worried about her father wouldn't have fooled around in the background.

608
00:49:29,970 --> 00:49:31,560
Here.

609
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:38,620
- What is this?
 - What could it be? I bought it.

610
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:43,010
I heard that girls these days all have one of these.

611
00:49:43,010 --> 00:49:48,290
Aside from when you're exercising, put it on when you go outside when you want to look cool.

612
00:49:48,290 --> 00:49:50,070
The color is pretty.

613
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:55,080
I think that was the new edition or something. They said it was popular these days.

614
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:57,910
In my eyes, everything looks the same.

615
00:49:58,750 --> 00:50:01,080
How is it? Dad, do I look pretty?

616
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:05,110
You look awkward. Since you're already here, have some food before you leave.

617
00:50:05,110 --> 00:50:09,710
There are beef ribs in the fridge. Should I grill them or steam them?

618
00:50:09,710 --> 00:50:11,210
Can't you grill half and steam the other half?

619
00:50:11,210 --> 00:50:14,050
How shameless. What good did you do?

620
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:17,800
How do you want the seasoning for the steamed beef? Spicy?

621
00:50:51,020 --> 00:50:55,610
 Haneul  Sports University 

622
00:50:58,370 --> 00:51:02,690
Si Ho. You know that you can't lose your balance, right?

623
00:51:02,690 --> 00:51:07,340
Make sure your moves are clean and pay attention to the angle of your legs. You have to especially careful with your pivot.

624
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:12,580
 #4, Haneul Sports University Song Si Ho. 

625
00:51:12,580 --> 00:51:16,840
 - Song Si Ho!
 - Good luck! 

626
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:20,820
  - Unni, you're so pretty!
 - Woo! 

627
00:52:21,430 --> 00:52:28,400


628
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:33,730
Hey, Jeong Joon Hyeong! Aren't you going to concentrate?! Increase your pace!

629
00:52:33,730 --> 00:52:37,890
 Are you here on a leisurely walk?! Turn! 

630
00:52:38,810 --> 00:52:41,860
 Acceleration, acceleration, acceleration! 

631
00:52:42,870 --> 00:52:46,390
Aish! You have to kick further!

632
00:52:46,390 --> 00:52:51,360
Kick, kick, kick harder! Lower your head! Faster!

633
00:52:57,010 --> 00:52:59,840
Joon Hyeong, what's wrong with you today? Why are you falling behind on your record so much?

634
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:03,700
Hey rascal, you had no problem going  through, by underwater kick, up to 14 - 15 meters after a turn!

635
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:18,100
You rascal! Where did you sleep yesterday, huh?

636
00:53:18,100 --> 00:53:20,260
What do you mean "sleep"? I told you, I played all night long.

637
00:53:20,260 --> 00:53:23,950
Ha, seriously! You went out without me and played all night long?

638
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:26,730
When, where, and with whom did you leave at what time and what time did you come back? Huh?

639
00:53:26,730 --> 00:53:30,060
Be quiet. I have lots of things to think about right now.

640
00:53:30,060 --> 00:53:34,890
Ugh, I'm speechless. I'm so speechless. I put on such a show yesterday night so I could cover for you.

641
00:53:34,890 --> 00:53:40,790
I said you had diarrhea so you had to run to the bathroom urgently. Ah, I have outstanding speed.

642
00:53:40,790 --> 00:53:44,490
The night-attendance teacher wasn't fooled. He chose to be fooled because you are a nuisance to deal with.

643
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:47,190
Hey, where are you going? Wait for me, let's go together!

644
00:53:47,190 --> 00:53:50,090
I have something to do. I'll leave first.

645
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:55,040
Good job today.

646
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:57,050
  Rhythmic Gymnastics Department 

647
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:06,180
Now, you all worked hard in today's competition.

648
00:54:06,180 --> 00:54:09,670
Make sure to check what you missed when you get home, alright?

649
00:54:09,670 --> 00:54:12,330
- Yes!
 - Dismissed!

650
00:54:12,330 --> 00:54:15,190
- Thank you for your work! 
 - Thank you for your work!

651
00:54:16,290 --> 00:54:23,330
Congratulations, Unni. Your performance today was good.

652
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:25,830
Cheer up.

653
00:54:39,070 --> 00:54:40,690
Yeah, Joon Hyeong.

654
00:54:40,690 --> 00:54:43,740
  If you don't have practice, come see me for a minute. 

655
00:54:54,340 --> 00:54:55,640
Joon Hyeong!

656
00:54:55,640 --> 00:55:00,330
You're here. I heard you had a competition today. Did you do well?

657
00:55:00,330 --> 00:55:02,530
Yeah, I did well.

658
00:55:03,690 --> 00:55:05,470
What a relief.

659
00:55:05,470 --> 00:55:10,470
My mirror broke this morning, so I thought, "Ah, I'm done for. My luck today is going to be terrible."

660
00:55:10,470 --> 00:55:12,600
I guess the opposite happens.

661
00:55:13,740 --> 00:55:15,710
Song Si Ho.

662
00:55:15,710 --> 00:55:18,880
- Hm?
 - Was it you?

663
00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:25,900
A few days ago, I saw you enter the weightlifting room at dawn.

664
00:55:27,020 --> 00:55:29,120
It can't be. It's not you, right?

665
00:55:30,620 --> 00:55:33,520
You came here because you already knew, so why ask?

666
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:36,540
What?

667
00:55:36,540 --> 00:55:40,240
Yeah, it was me. I did it.

668
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:43,180
I put that there in the weightlifting room on purpose.

669
00:55:43,180 --> 00:55:50,150
Why? Why did you do that? What do you gain out of that?

670
00:55:50,150 --> 00:55:52,820
Do you know how complicated things have become for Bok Joo because of you?!

671
00:55:52,820 --> 00:55:58,210
- Then what about you? Why are you so angry?
 - What?

672
00:55:58,210 --> 00:56:03,440
It's not even your business. Exactly what is she to you that you get so worked up and push me into a corner?

673
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:06,900
- Is she your girlfriend?
 - Song Si Ho.

674
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:10,960
Yeah, you laughed like an idiot whenever you were with her. That image bothered me.

675
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:14,510
I fretted over her who disarmed you. But the obesity clinic?

676
00:56:14,510 --> 00:56:19,280
It was ridiculous, yet she attended a place like that. She weight-lifts. Who does she want to look good in front of that she's losing weight?

677
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:23,080
Exactly why did you turn out like this? Hey, we...

678
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:26,970
We're not in the relationship you're thinking of. She even has someone else she likes.

679
00:56:26,970 --> 00:56:30,950
Then what about you? What do you feel?

680
00:56:31,780 --> 00:56:35,690
Aish. I don't know why I have to make this sort of excuse, but we're just classmates—

681
00:56:35,690 --> 00:56:38,920
I hate the fact that she's your classmate!

682
00:56:40,930 --> 00:56:46,240
I don't know why I'm like this either. Although I'm scared that I'm losing my mind,

683
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:54,040
I hate it. I hate that someone else is next to you, that you're laughing with someone else other than me.

684
00:56:55,030 --> 00:56:59,400
So, don't make me crazy.

685
00:57:11,890 --> 00:57:16,310
  My brother seemed worried about you too. He said that, without calling, you didn't show up. 

686
00:57:17,340 --> 00:57:23,820
I should at least call him to tell him I can't go to the hospital anymore. Ah, what do I say?
