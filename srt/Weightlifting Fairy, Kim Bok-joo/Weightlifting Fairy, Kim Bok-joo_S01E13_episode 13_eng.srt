00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:59,680
  Did you get back safely? 

3
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,790
  What about you? 

4
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:11,290
  Keke. 

5
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:13,720
  You must be tired. Go to sleep now. 

6
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:17,660
  You go to sleep too now. You have training tomorrow. 

7
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,360
  You go to sleep first. 

8
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,140
  I don't want to. You go to sleep first.

00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,790

 Episode 13
 Love's jealousy is a rounding down.  

20
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:17,770
- Hello!
 - Hello.

21
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:21,100
Nan Hee, Nan Hee! Have you been well?

22
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,900
Wait a second.

23
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:46,100
What? Did you find a huge chunk of beef in your beef stew?

24
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:48,640
There was no meat in mine, just loads of vegetables and soup.

25
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,810
What's wrong with the beef stew? It was good.

26
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:53,150
What is this unusually positive mode?

27
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:57,570
Where is the Athlete Kim who wanted to run for student body president because the amount of meat in the meals was reduced?

28
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:00,970
Hey, did something good happen to you?

29
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:02,760
What good thing?

30
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,630
No, I'm sure there's something.

31
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,100
  Come to the toad's house. 

32
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:16,690
- What is it?
 - Spam.

33
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:29,650
Yes!

34
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:38,450
Okay!

35
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,600
What do you want so early in the morning?

36
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,210
I threw the coin in your place. You can just pray now.

37
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:58,290
Hey, this is why you told me to pray, isn't it?! You only learned the bad things!

38
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:03,060
Who's calling who bad? Don't you remember what happened yesterday? You came on to me!

39
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:06,210
- Hey, when did I ever come onto you?! You kissed me first—
 - Yeah,

40
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:10,100
I only kissed you but then you suddenly grabbed my face like this and kissed me roughly as if you had been starved for days—

41
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,970
Okay, okay!

42
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,670
We'll just say that I was the one who came on to you.

43
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:22,050
But that... hairpin you have on right now. Isn't that the one you wore when you met my older brother?

44
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:26,610
My brother said that looked good, didn't he? Or did he say it suited you well?

45
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:28,340
No, he didn't.

46
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:32,180
Don't lie! I know everything! From now on, don't put that on!

47
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:34,660
- Put on something else!
 - I have nothing else.

48
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:38,990
- This is pretty. 
 - It's not pretty at all! It's really ugly! It's really crappy!

49
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:42,810
- Take it off. 
 - Why? This is the only hairpin I have.

50
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:45,420
Take it off! Take this off Take it off!

51
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:47,770
Take it off! Take it off!

52
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:49,980
Take it off!

53
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:55,370
Aish! You even ripped out strands of my hair!

54
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,300
Hey, I'm sorry...

55
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:01,100
Instead, come with me for a minute. Just for a minute.

56
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:05,300
Hey, don't grab my hand. I didn't even put on hand-cream so my hand is rough.

57
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:11,890
It's fine. I'll even get a pressure-point massage on the way, it's nice.

58
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:15,420
Let's go, Hon— No, Fatty. Let's go.

59
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:18,450
Why? Where are we going?

60
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:56,190
Hey, why did we come here?

61
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:58,390
For that.

62
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:01,910
- Pick.
 - What?

63
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:05,700
Pick. I'll buy you hairpins so from now on. Only wear the hairpins that I buy for you.

64
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:09,030
Don't wear something like that ribbon from before, alright?

65
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:12,680
Jeong Joon Hyeong, you're unexpectedly really jealous.

66
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:17,860
Then would I not be jealous? I saw you crying, bawling, and doing all sorts of strange things for my brother.

67
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:21,350
You can't focus on the past like a loser. Everything's all in the past.

68
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:23,160
Like a loser?

69
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,660
Hey, I'm telling you this because we're already on the topic.

70
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:29,990
I'm not the type to get jealous over small things just because we're dating,

71
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:33,940
and I hate things like playing hard to get. It doesn't fit my type and it's so childish.

72
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:36,050
So from now on, don't expect those things from me, understand?

73
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:39,890
- So are you going to buy a pin or not?
 - Of course I have to buy one! Which one should I get?

74
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:44,840
Hey, what about this one? It fits your image perfectly.

75
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:52,830
Oh! Oh, Bok Joo, why are you in there?

76
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:57,520
- Bok Joo, why are you suddenly in there?
 - This one, the big one, the big one. What about this one?

77
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,770
Give it to me. Let me see.

78
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,220
This one, what about this one?

79
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:06,530
Oh, a strawberry!

80
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:11,550
Wow, it's so pretty even though I can't see it from here. Wow, it's pretty!

81
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:25,510
Unni! Unni! Pull yourself together, Unni! Teacher! Teacher!

82
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:33,620
Unni! What do I do?! Supervisor!

83
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:41,490
 911 Ambulance 

84
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,090
What's going on, seriously?

85
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:11,060
Joon Hyeong! Joon Hyeong! Joon Hyeong! Joon Hyeong! Joon Hyeong! Joon Hyeong! Joon Hyeong!

86
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:14,370
Ah, really! What a fuss! Why? Did the little boss summon us again?

87
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:17,390
Not the little boss! But Song Si Ho! Song Si Ho!

88
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:21,030
Hey, Song Si Ho took pills to commit suicide!

89
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:23,490
Bok Joo discovered her on the floor unconscious

90
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:26,790
and an ambulance just took her.

91
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,720
  Emergency Center 

92
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:55,090
Are you Song Si Ho's guardian?

93
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:58,100
Ah, yes, well...

94
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,700
We finished pumping her stomach well.

95
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,710
According to the results of a blood test, she didn't take a lot of pills.

96
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:05,360
I don't think this was a suicide attempt.

97
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,230
But the patient is in a very weakened condition.

98
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:10,960
She is malnourished but has a high glucose level.

99
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:16,190
Besides the reflux esophagitis, she seems to have an eating disorder of repeating anorexia and bulimia.

100
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:18,740
We'll get her hospitalized first to check on her condition.

101
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:21,990
Yes, thank you.

102
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:29,620
Si Ho!

103
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:38,590
Si Ho, why are you like this? What are you doing here?

104
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:40,810
Open your eyes, please?

105
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:42,570
Unni...

106
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:49,290
Si Ho, can you see me?

107
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,090
Mom...

108
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:57,120
Unni, it's me.

109
00:10:57,830 --> 00:11:01,030
Si Ho, are you okay?

110
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,440
How is Unni Song Si Ho? Is she okay?

111
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:20,390
Yeah, I just came back after seeing her wake up. According to the doctor, her condition isn't dangerous.

112
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:22,160
Ah, that's a relief.

113
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:27,830
Well, they say that because of insomnia, she kept taking the sleeping pills. And she also has an eating disorder.

114
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:32,040
She has become so weak that she has to be hospitalized and treated.

115
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:36,660
Hey, are you okay? You were really shocked earlier, weren't you?

116
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:41,540
Being shocked isn't that big of a deal. I did wrong.

117
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:46,520
When I assumed that her condition wasn't good, I shouldn't have just overlooked it.

118
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:50,200
I witnessed her binge-eating at night.

119
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:54,810
You didn't know that a situation like this would occur. Don't blame yourself.

120
00:11:54,810 --> 00:12:01,150
Still, she's my roommate. I should have checked on her, even just once, when I thought she was just sleeping in.

121
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:05,660
I was just so excited after seeing your text. Ah, this stupid!

122
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:09,090
What crime did your head commit? Don't do it.

123
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:11,020
Goodness.

124
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:25,320
  Missed Call: Si Ho 

125
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:28,740
  What about this one? 

126
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:31,730
  A big one, a big one, a big one! 

127
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:34,290
  Oh, that's pretty! Santa, Santa! 

128
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:35,280
 Where is the Santa one? 

129
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,880
 It's pretty. 

130
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:47,730
 GIANT Bar 

131
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:52,280
Careful, careful!

132
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:58,220
Dean! You promised me, alright?

133
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:04,480
Our Coach Choi, you have to reinstate her. Reinstate her! You promised to look into reinstating her.

134
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,760
Alright, alright!

135
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:12,230
No, no, no, I don't believe you. Come on, promise me.

136
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:14,940
This person, seriously! I promise.

137
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:17,990
Yes, please take care on your way back.

138
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:20,920
Watch your head.

139
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,470
Here, here, here.

140
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:25,610
Here, please take good care of him.

141
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:29,230
Dean, you promised me.

142
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:31,260
Please take care on your way back.

143
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:45,510
Wow, I only have $2 left.

144
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:48,800
Okay! I'm walking home, then.

145
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:56,940
Seong Eun, just you wait.

146
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:00,690
I will reinstate you no matter what! I will!

147
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:03,140
Hey!

148
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:25,880
Joon Hyeong.

149
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,650
Hey, why are you here alone?

150
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:30,830
My younger sister went to school and my mom went to work.

151
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:34,060
Shouldn't you be lying down?

152
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:38,730
No, I just woke up from a long sleep and I feel fine to the point of being apologetic.

153
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,670
Should we leave?

154
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,390
- Let's sit here for a minute.
 - Alright.

155
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:58,830
Hey, aren't you cold?

156
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:00,460
I'm fine.

157
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:06,870
I'm sorry for not picking up your call yesterday.

158
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:12,260
I didn't know that you were in that kind of situation. I should have answered.

159
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:15,600
No, it's fine. I'm the one who made it like that anyway.

160
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:21,100
Joon Hyeong, I feel really strange right now.

161
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:24,390
Yesterday was only a day ago,

162
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:29,320
but the previous events that brought me here seem like they happened so long ago.

163
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,510
Is it because I almost died?

164
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:40,910
I'm sure you already know, but the only thing we've done after becoming mature is our field of athletics.

165
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:47,410
Once we get pushed out of our positions, we feel as if the world is ending. I guess that's why I couldn't admit it and held on to it.

166
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:53,760
Even though I knew I was going downhill, I held on to the end of the cliff and struggled hard.

167
00:15:55,160 --> 00:16:01,390
But now, I think I'll be able to put everything down and train comfortably.

168
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:08,680
I kept clinging on to you when I knew it wouldn't work out...

169
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,970
I'm really sorry.

170
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:17,990
Then, I guess we're even. We both have something we're sorry to the other for.

171
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:23,460
Here, let's be friends.

172
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:30,710
Call me "noona" (sister) from now on.

173
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:32,710
Hey, when will you be discharged?

174
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:37,400
Tomorrow or the day after tomorrow. The doctor said my condition had gotten better.

175
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:42,060
But I still seem to have some aftereffects psychologically. I guess I'll need to get some psychological treatment.

176
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:48,520
Hey, I have a therapist who counsels me. He's really amazing. Should I introduce you to him?

177
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,470
Then I'd be thankful.

178
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:02,430
Yeah, Bok Joo?

179
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:04,180
Jeong Joon Hyeong, where are you?

180
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:07,210
Me? I'm at the hospital.

181
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:10,720
  My coach told us to have individual practice this afternoon so I just dropped by. 

182
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,740
I see. How is Unni Song Si Ho's condition?

183
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:17,770
She seems fine. Her condition is stable now.

184
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:19,790
What a relief, seriously.

185
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:22,900
I was just about to visit the hospital too, we should have gone together.

186
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:28,460
Ahh. I thought you were still in training. Do you want to come now?

187
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:31,400
Should I? Then I'll be there soon.

188
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,700
Yeah, take care coming here.

189
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,240
Yeah.

190
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:42,730
He should have told me beforehand. If he had done, I would have matched my schedule to go together with him.

191
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:47,540
What do you mean? Removing her?

192
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:51,710
I mean, this is different from what you said you would do yesterday. You promised to reinstate her.

193
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:55,460
You'd hold the personnel committee meeting again and lead to her reinstatement her with a salary reduction.

194
00:17:55,460 --> 00:18:00,120
I was planning to, but the higher-ups have already decided on this issue. What can I do now?

195
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:05,090
The reason I'm trying to reinstate Coach Choi is because she knows the kids the best.

196
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:09,850
She's led them well until now, and I believe that she'll continue to do so in the future.

197
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:14,690
I'm telling you that this issue is already finished! My head hurts too, stop talking about that!

198
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:18,390
Dean! Fine.

199
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:23,760
If you ignore the professor's opinion and handle the personnel matter like this, I'll quit!

200
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,090
Do whatever you want!

201
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:27,520
Th-That person, seriously...

202
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:35,770
Yes?

203
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:44,560
Oh, you're here.

204
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:49,890
I just came back from outside and it was chilly here.

205
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:53,480
Ah, yes. Are you okay now?

206
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:58,180
I just came back from the dead. It's nice to see you after such a long time, my roommate.

207
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:00,270
Ah, sit down.

208
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:03,190
Come here.

209
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:14,650
Um, this. I thought that it would be too early to bring food...

210
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:18,130
and it suits your feminine and delicate image.

211
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:19,780
Thank you.

212
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:23,190
Hey, you have a pollen allergy. Will you be okay?

213
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:26,550
Well, I feel a little bit of tingle but I'm fine.

214
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:31,930
I didn't even know you had something like that. If I'd known, I would have just bought some drinks.

215
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:34,410
It's okay, we can just put them back there.

216
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:43,630
I'm a bit dizzy after talking so much. I need to lie down.

217
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:46,010
Ah, I'll adjust the bed for you.

218
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:47,810
I'll do it.

219
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:24,220
Why are you so modest today? It's unlike you.

220
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:26,860
Do I have to be talkative and frivolous all the time?

221
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:29,890
I mean, you're just unusually quiet today compared to other days.

222
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:33,020
When you don't have anything to talk about, why do you have to talk?

223
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:37,960
Bad joke fail. It's really not funny. It's not.

224
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:42,670
Hey, I have some knowledge in dad jokes because of my dad. Should we have a battle?

225
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:45,430
Forget it. It's bothersome. Stop making me talk.

226
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:48,610
Why is our Fatty getting so irritated?

227
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:52,460
Ah, I know! It's way past your snack-time!

228
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:56,600
You're getting irritated and annoyed because your stomach is empty, aren't you?

229
00:20:57,810 --> 00:20:59,950
I did wrong, it was my fault.

230
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:02,810
Okay. Let's go eat something, Fatty.

231
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:05,440
Forget it, it's bothersome. I'm not hungry.

232
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:09,240
Hey, there's a time when you're not hungry? Stop lying.

233
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:12,340
There's a time when you're not hungry? Come on, don't be like this. Let's go.

234
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:13,340
Let's go eat something.

235
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:14,610
I said I'm fine!

236
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:16,260
Let's go! Now!

237
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:18,490
We'll start off with the fish cakes you love so much.

238
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:19,380
Welcome.

239
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:22,260
Yes, hello.

240
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:26,580
What should I eat?

241
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:32,890
Yeah, Song Si Ho. No, I'm not back at the school yet.

242
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:39,600
Ah, the therapist? No, he's not part of a hospital, he just offers counseling services by himself.

243
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,820
Yeah, he's someone my older brother introduced to me. Yeah.

244
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:56,330
No, I mean... I just think seeing a therapist will be better if you want to continue receiving mental treatment.

245
00:21:56,330 --> 00:22:00,850
It's been minutes since they last saw each other. How could they still have so much to say? You might as well just date her again.

246
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:04,820
Although I'm sure following the treatment your hospital recommends isn't bad,

247
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:08,350
the therapist makes you feel at ease.

248
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:13,900
No, it's not that far from school. Do you remember the pasta restaurant we went to together in the past?

249
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:16,380
It's about a block away from that restaurant.

250
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:22,770
If you want to meet him, tell me. I'll ask him about his schedule.

251
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:24,980
Yeah.

252
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:29,890
Hey, eat slowly. You'll get indigestion.

253
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:36,320
You said that you weren't hungry before. You were born with the talent of eating.

254
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:40,890
Have you ever thought about challenging the Guinness Book of World Records, my pig?

255
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:42,620
What? Pig?

256
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:46,840
Fine, fine, I'll cancel that. Cancel the pig, you're just Fatty.

257
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:52,190
I can't even call you Fatty? Even though that's something I've called you by until now?

258
00:22:53,380 --> 00:23:01,290
Fine. If you're that sensitive about it, I won't ever call you names like "Pig" or "Fatty"... never.

259
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:06,950
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Okay, okay, I'm sorry! Let's go together, wait for me!

260
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:08,320
How much is it? How much do I have to pay you?

261
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:11,020
 - $16.
  - What?

262
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:12,720
- How much?
-  $16. 

263
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,540
How much did she eat? Did she eat all of this?

264
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:17,320
  Yes, all of it. 

265
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,230
Bok Joo!

266
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:25,690
What's wrong with you? Why are you getting mad over something like that? That's unlike you, Kim Bok Joo.

267
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:27,230
Stop bothering me and go away.

268
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:30,350
Okay, I'll really be careful with my words from now on, alright? Come on, don't be mad anymore.

269
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:31,710
Don't be mad anymore, alright? Don't be mad.

270
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:34,050
Quit bothering me!

271
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:41,660
That's why I told you to stop. Why did you grab onto me and make such a fuss?

272
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:44,800
Bok Joo, blood... I'm bleeding.

273
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,670
I'm bleeding. Blood, there's blood.

274
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:49,750
You're a man, yet you're making such a fuss over a small scratch.

275
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:53,140
Hey, what do you mean "small"? These small cuts smart and hurt more!

276
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:55,940
You have to tell me what you're mad about for me to know, you rascal!

277
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:58,210
I don't think you're like this because I called you a pig.

278
00:23:58,210 --> 00:23:59,890
I said I'm not mad.

279
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:00,880
You are mad.

280
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,640
- I'm not mad. 
 - You are mad!

281
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:06,760
You keep insisting that I'm mad when I'm not mad and it's about to make me mad right now! You're such a strange kid!

282
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:09,290
Move! I have to go to training!

283
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:16,480
She is mad! What is she mad about?

284
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:20,250
If he's curious as to why I'm mad, maybe he should take a look at his actions.

285
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:23,130
Kim Bok Joo, I didn't see you like that but you're a woman by nature, by nature!

286
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:25,440
A human being should have basic manners.

287
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,490
What is he doing with his ex-girlfriend in front of his current girlfriend?

288
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:31,180
Does he really have to make it that obvious?

289
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:35,590
Ugh, I can't even show that I'm jealous because it'll be childish! I'm so pissed!

290
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:45,220
What?

291
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:52,790
Still, if even the professor just quits like that, what are we supposed to do?

292
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:54,500
Should we just play around? Are we not going to train?

293
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:58,710
Hey, there's no way he would have really quit. I'm sure he just said that out of anger.

294
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:00,990
What are you talking about? What did the professor do?

295
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:04,620
It seems the professor was working to reinstate Coach Choi,

296
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:09,920
but the school assigned a new coach one-sidedly today so the professor said he would quit and he left.

297
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:13,810
Hey, let's leave. What's the use of us staying in this weightlifting room when our professor doesn't even care?

298
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:14,800
That's what I'm saying!

299
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:18,720
He's saying that the coach who embezzled the operating funds is the only important person and we're nothing!

300
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,180
Hey, hey, forget everything. Training or whatever, let's leave.

301
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:23,690
- Come on—
 - It's not the Coach's fault.

302
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:27,280
It's all because of me.

303
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:38,410
The coach used the operating funds because of me.

304
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:44,860
I have no words. I'm sorry, it's all my fault.

305
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:50,530
I should have told everyone when the incident happened, but she was so adamant about taking the blame.

306
00:25:50,530 --> 00:25:55,190
See? I told you that our coach isn't someone to just use the operating funds for herself.

307
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:03,760
What do we do now? If we didn't know, it would have been fine but since we now know the reason,

308
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,600
are we just going to let the coach and the professor leave like this?

309
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:10,900
Shouldn't we ask them to bring back our professor? Shouldn't we plead his case?

310
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:13,520
Will it work just because we ask them to?

311
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:19,360
If it doesn't work the first time, then we should endure until it does. With all our guts.

312
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:28,040
The weightlifting department requests the reinstatement of Coach Choi Seong Eun!

313
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,970
We request it! We request it!

314
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:31,910
We request taking appropriate steps!

315
00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:33,660
We request it! We request it!

316
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:35,470
We demand reinstatement!

317
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:38,500
We demand it! We demand it!

318
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:45,540
It's so freaking cold. It's much colder than I thought it would be. Why did I suggest we protest outside?

319
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:49,940
Hey, you were the one who said that we had to protest in the cold to show them our determination.

320
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:51,650
I'm about to freeze to death.

321
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:53,150
That's true but...

322
00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:57,190
I'm fine with being cold but I'm so hungry.

323
00:26:57,190 --> 00:27:00,780
Hyun Cheol, are you okay? You get dizzy if you even skip a single meal.

324
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:07,610
I'm fine. My motto is that a hungry Socrates is better than a full pig.

325
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:11,550
Soybean paste stew!

326
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:14,060
I guess today's menu is soybean paste stew.

327
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:19,760
No. Although this may seem like soybean paste stew at first, seeing that the scent of the ocean is rampant,

328
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,890
this is crab stew made with soybean paste.

329
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:25,460
Bok Joo's correct. This is crab stew. I'm 100% sure of it.

330
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:30,800
Crab stew must be delicious! It's amazing if you mix rice in the fresh hot stew!

331
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:31,820
That's amazing...

332
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:36,340
Stop it. If you talk more, you'll get even hungrier.

333
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:38,100
I'm hungry.

334
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,600
 Are you going to dissolve the weightlifting department? 

335
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,310
What are those people?

336
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:51,150
The students of the weightlifting department are asking to reinstate Coach Choi Seong Eun.

337
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:53,160
They claim to be on a hunger strike.

338
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:55,730
Seriously, they're doing all sorts of things.

339
00:27:55,730 --> 00:27:58,940
Both the professor and his disciples are both lunatics.

340
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:01,140
It's cold. I'm sure they'll leave after some time.

341
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:02,910
Please go inside.

342
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:05,930
Where is he going?

343
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:11,950
I forgot about this. You're still here!

344
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:20,010
I guess winter training is less harsh than it used to be. You look like you have way too much leisure these days.

345
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:24,600
I just came during my dinner break. I'm going to leave after a cup of coffee.

346
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:30,230
What about you? How is your dating business going?

347
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:32,610
You don't even come to our school to see Doctor Ah Yeong often anymore.

348
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:36,290
It's just... I have a lot of thoughts these days.

349
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:40,790
Why? Did Doctor Ah Yeong say that she can't be a sunflower anymore? Does she want to call everything off?

350
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:44,260
I guess you should set down a straw mat and become a psychic. It's something similar.

351
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:47,460
I knew this would happen. "Just friends" between a man and a woman? Yeah, right.

352
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:50,360
You're really a problem.

353
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:53,910
How can you have less sense than your younger brother at times?

354
00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:56,840
I know, right?

355
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:00,050
What about you? Are you making some progress with Bok Joo?

356
00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:02,900
Of course I am. Am I you?

357
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:08,500
What? You confessed, didn't you?

358
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:12,940
Hey, congratulations.

359
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:15,330
But I'm a bit miserable.

360
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:21,790
When women get angry over something, why do they hope for the man to guess what it is instead of just saying it outright?

361
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:23,290
Are we contestants on a quiz show or something?

362
00:29:23,290 --> 00:29:26,060
That's the game of dating.

363
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:27,330
What? Is Bok Joo upset?

364
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:30,020
Yeah! But I have no idea what she's upset about.

365
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:31,790
I feel as if I'm stuck inside a maze.

366
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:37,790
Think about it carefully. I'm sure if you wander about a bit, the exit will appear.

367
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:42,840
You're dating amidst all this. You're much better than me, you rascal.

368
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:45,820
Of course, I'm much better than you.

369
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,340
Oh? Isn't that Bok Joo?

370
00:29:56,340 --> 00:30:01,720
 Hunger Strike 01: It's possible to earn one gold, one silver, two bronzes at 2016 Championship because of Professor Yoon and Coach Choi!! We want Coach Choi  Seong Eun to be  reinstated! 

371
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:04,480
What is she doing there?

372
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:11,780
What are you doing here?

373
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:15,820
I asked, what are you doing?

374
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:20,300
Can you not read Hangul? We're protesting for reinstatement. It's a hunger strike.

375
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:23,460
 We want Coach Choi Seong Eun to be reinstated. 

376
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:28,100
Hey, do you know how many degrees the temperature will drop into the negatives tonight?

377
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:30,470
What are you doing outside in the middle of winter?

378
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:34,040
Why do you care? Forget it. It's a matter within our department.

379
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,360
Hey, care...

380
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:39,300
I can't just "not care." If you continue to do this, you'll freeze to death, you rascal.

381
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:42,810
Whether someone freezes to death or not, don't mind someone else's business.

382
00:30:42,810 --> 00:30:46,140
You already have your plate full.

383
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:48,860
Contrary to your looks, you're quite nosy.

384
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:50,470
Hey!

385
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:54,950
Are you really going to talk like that?

386
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:57,700
I'm like this because I'm worried.

387
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:04,130
Yeah, fine. Who can stop you?

388
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:07,230
Do whatever you want.

389
00:31:36,810 --> 00:31:38,810
You didn't answer my calls.

390
00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:42,660
You chose not to answer my calls, right?

391
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:45,070
Yeah, I chose not to.

392
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:52,810
I was too emotional that day, I'm sorry.

393
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:58,530
After hearing your words, I thought about it too.

394
00:31:58,530 --> 00:32:03,760
For the past ten years, you really were always by my side.

395
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:08,940
When I didn't have a friend to eat lunch with, when I needed a drinking buddy,

396
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:14,140
when I had to go to a meeting but felt too awkward to just go alone.

397
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:19,880
But I thought of that as a given.

398
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:25,150
Let's date, Ah Yeong.

399
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:29,800
Let's date properly.

400
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:34,960
Hey, Jeong Jae Yi, you're really...

401
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,860
Is it that dating is an event for helping the needy?

402
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:43,250
Love doesn't work just because you work hard, you idiot.

403
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:50,160
Ah Yeong.

404
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:58,750
I'll just thankfully accept your friendship.

405
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:02,290
It's cold, you should leave.

406
00:34:01,650 --> 00:34:05,730
What is she doing outside in the middle of winter?

407
00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:08,610
When the head is ignorant, the body is the one that suffers.

408
00:34:08,610 --> 00:34:13,890
Ugh, she needs to tell me what she's mad about for me to know anything!

409
00:34:13,890 --> 00:34:16,470
Woo, it's snowing again!

410
00:34:16,470 --> 00:34:18,220
- So much snow—
 - Hey!

411
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:18,880
Is it snowing?

412
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:21,380
Yeah. Wow, I don't think it'll stop anytime soon.

413
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:25,560
Ah, it's freezing! The roads are going to ice over.

414
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:31,150
Ugh, this tiring winter. I despise being cold!

415
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:35,800
Hey, should we rest for a bit?

416
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:36,940
- Yeah, yeah.
 - Let's rest.

417
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:38,170
Let's rest for a few minutes and strengthen up.

418
00:34:38,170 --> 00:34:40,250
- Yeah.
 - I have to to go to the bathroom.

419
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:42,150
Come back quickly.

420
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:44,210
 We want Coach Choi Seong Eun to be reinstated. 

421
00:35:34,490 --> 00:35:36,280
Put your shoes on.

422
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:38,580
Arms.

423
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:00,670
Protest while taking care of your body,

424
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,550
please.

425
00:37:15,850 --> 00:37:17,780
What are two of them doing there?

426
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,900
- What?
 - Who is that?

427
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:21,800
I don't know.

428
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:23,810
- What are they doing over there?
 - Oh?

429
00:37:23,810 --> 00:37:25,470
- Isn't he from the swimming department?
 - Huh?

430
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:27,230
- He is. 
 - Ah...

431
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,180
I'll leave now.

432
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:32,060
Why, huh?

433
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:34,550
The mood is strange between those two.

434
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:47,660
Ah, he's a male friend of mine

435
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:51,290
but he came all the way here because his friend was suffering. He is so nosy.

436
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:57,310
You must be so happy! If I had a male friend who did that for me, I would wish for nothing else.

437
00:37:57,310 --> 00:37:59,580
I envy you!

438
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:21,560
Maybe it's because it snowed yesterday but the roads are frozen.

439
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:24,920
Hyung! Go inside and rest.

440
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:30,010
Am I some corpse? I just woke up from resting. Why do you keep telling me to rest?

441
00:38:30,010 --> 00:38:33,970
I rested so much that my back hurts from lying down.

442
00:38:33,970 --> 00:38:36,950
I dare you to faint again.

443
00:38:38,790 --> 00:38:41,740
Why did that fall? How strange.

444
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:47,740
It's fine. Ugh, I had a disturbing dream last night.

445
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:51,410
Hey, give Bok Joo a call.

446
00:38:51,410 --> 00:38:56,580
I'm sure there's nothing wrong. After going back school, she is training hard—  I got it.

447
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:02,950
Yeah, Bok Joo. Where are you? Did you eat?

448
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:07,780
Of course, I ate. I ate the radish leaf soup today.
  Hunger Strike - Day 2 

449
00:39:08,730 --> 00:39:13,080
I'm in the weightlifting training room right now. Is Father okay?

450
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:17,630
Yeah. I'll call you back later, Uncle. Yeah.

451
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:30,650
Hyeon Cheol, you can't sleep.

452
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:33,490
Hey, open your eyes, you rascal.

453
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:36,070
Hey, pull yourself together.

454
00:39:36,070 --> 00:39:38,520
- Hey!
-Hyun Cheol!

455
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:39,320
Sunbae Hyeon Cheol!

456
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,250
- Hey!
 - Wake up!

457
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:42,190
Sang Chul, I'll stay here so move him to the ER.

458
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:43,590
- Careful!
 - Come on, support him!

459
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:45,720
Sunbae, please wake up quickly!

460
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:46,620
- Hyeon Cheol!
- Hyeon Cheol, wake up!

461
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:48,980
What do we do?

462
00:40:16,590 --> 00:40:18,800
Ah, I really can't do this anymore.

463
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:23,490
My legs feel like they're going to fall off.

464
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:24,900
- Nan Hee, are you okay? 
 - Nan Hee.

465
00:40:24,930 --> 00:40:27,160
No, I'm not fine.

466
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:31,020
Hey, Bok Joo. You have a nose-bleed.

467
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:33,200
Hey!

468
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:36,590
Ah, seriously. You're having nosebleeds. What is this?

469
00:40:36,590 --> 00:40:41,100
This won't do. You two, go in now. I think we've done as much as we can.

470
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:44,230
No, Sunbae! If we quit here,

471
00:40:44,230 --> 00:40:46,500
then everything we've done will have been nothing.

472
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:49,380
We might not be able to see the professor and coach anymore.

473
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:53,160
What are we doing because of my guilt?

474
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:55,240
Sunbaenim...

475
00:40:56,990 --> 00:40:59,570
Bok Joo! Nan Hee!

476
00:40:59,570 --> 00:41:01,680
- Sunbae Woon Gi.
 - Soon Ok.

477
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:05,540
Lee Soon Ok! Why did you only come now?!

478
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:10,010
I was worried after receiving your text message, so I ran away while my mom was grocery shopping. I did well, didn't I?

479
00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:16,200
Do you know how hard it was for me?

480
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,940
Don't worry for now. You know I came back.

481
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:20,830
Soon Ok.

482
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:24,800
Don't cry, come here. Goodness,

483
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,390
my babies.

484
00:41:26,390 --> 00:41:31,810
Ah, seriously! Lee Soon Ok, I missed you!

485
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:42,650
Lee Soon Ok! You're my roommate but you weren't next to me!

486
00:41:42,650 --> 00:41:44,550
Right...

487
00:41:46,610 --> 00:41:50,650
Woon Gi, Woon Gi! Big news, big news, big news!

488
00:41:50,650 --> 00:41:54,680
I just heard that our new coach is just one of our Dean's personal connections.

489
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:59,640
Yeah, he's never done any weightlifting before. He just co-majored in physical education. Does this even make any sense?

490
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:05,880
Since it's turned out like this, this is no longer a problem with just Coach Choi. Our weightlifting department can't become a crappy artifact.

491
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,800
Let's properly do this protest, all in.

492
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,800
- Let's do this!
 - Yeah, let's do this!

493
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,730
I'm seriously speechless!

494
00:42:11,730 --> 00:42:14,270
- Let's do this!
 - Yes!

495
00:42:14,270 --> 00:42:17,270
- Fighting against corruption!
 - Fighting against corruption!

496
00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:20,290
- Fighting against corruption! 
 - Fighting against corruption!

497
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:22,000
Fighting against corruption!

498
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,300
- Is a coaching job also for a person born with a gold spoon?!
 - Do you think the weightlifting department is easy?!

499
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:28,500
- Fighting against corruption!
 - Fighting against corruption!

500
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:31,800
- Do you think the weightlifting department is easy?!
 -Do you think the weightlifting department is easy?!

501
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:36,050
- Is a coaching job also for a person born with a gold spoon?!
 - Is a coaching job also for a person born with a gold spoon?!

502
00:42:53,010 --> 00:42:55,990
Ugh, what time is it?

503
00:43:04,170 --> 00:43:06,030
  Dean 

504
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:11,630
Yes, this is Yoon Deok Man.

505
00:43:13,230 --> 00:43:16,670
What? My students?

506
00:43:16,670 --> 00:43:20,530
- What do you mean "hiring someone with connections"?!
- What do you mean "hiring someone with connections"?!

507
00:43:20,530 --> 00:43:23,020
- Heaven, listen to us! 
 - Heaven, listen to us!

508
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:24,300
Those rascals, seriously!

509
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:27,800
- What do you mean "hiring someone with connections"?!
 - What do you mean "hiring someone with connections"?!

510
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:30,640
Hey, you rascals! Are you all crazy?!

511
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:35,050
Huh? During the time you should be training with barbells, who told you to do something like this?!

512
00:43:35,050 --> 00:43:40,450
Professor, we're really sorry but we can't just sit still like this any longer.

513
00:43:40,450 --> 00:43:44,590
Although we wish for Coach Choi's reinstatement the most, this is more than that now.

514
00:43:44,590 --> 00:43:48,460
We can't accept a personal connection coach who doesn't know the "weight" of "weightlifting".

515
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:52,650
Hey, you rascals! Still, if you get blacklisted by acting like this too,

516
00:43:52,650 --> 00:43:55,590
what will you do then? Who'll take responsibility?

517
00:43:55,590 --> 00:43:58,660
- Go back! Go back in now!
 - No, wait!

518
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:01,610
- Go back in!
 - No, we can't!

519
00:44:01,610 --> 00:44:03,880
Fine, I have no other choice.

520
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:06,130
If you won't go back in now, I'll just...

521
00:44:06,130 --> 00:44:08,610
- Step over me and go!
 - Professor!

522
00:44:08,610 --> 00:44:11,730
- Get up!
 - Step over me!

523
00:44:11,730 --> 00:44:13,140
- Step over me!
 - Professor!

524
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:15,710
- Professor, get up!
 - Get him up!

525
00:44:15,710 --> 00:44:18,420
- Professor!
 - Wait, wait! I have a call. I have to take this call!

526
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:22,350
I knew this would happen, sheesh!

527
00:44:23,610 --> 00:44:26,510
Hello? Yes, Dean.

528
00:44:26,510 --> 00:44:29,870
I'm b-blocking the students right now.

529
00:44:29,870 --> 00:44:33,890
What? Are you serious?

530
00:44:33,890 --> 00:44:37,990
Really?! Yes, yes, thank you!

531
00:44:37,990 --> 00:44:40,700
Yes, thank you! Yes, yes, yes!

532
00:44:41,450 --> 00:44:45,140
Hey, Coach Choi will be reinstated!

533
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:46,560
- What?
 - Are you serious?

534
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:48,380
- Seriously?
 - Yeah.

535
00:44:48,380 --> 00:44:50,170
They just decided at the board meeting that they'll finish it by

536
00:44:50,170 --> 00:44:53,880
reinstating her and cutting her salary for three months.

550
00:45:52,270 --> 00:45:56,500
that I'll treat you to all of this today, so just empty out our restaurant before you leave!

551
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:02,530
Glasses up!

552
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:07,910
After seeing our weightlifting department come together this time, I felt many things.

553
00:46:07,910 --> 00:46:09,430
The will that you can accomplish something

554
00:46:09,430 --> 00:46:12,850
and the certainty that there is no fear when we are all together!

555
00:46:12,850 --> 00:46:16,220
As a teacher, I've learned more things from you all this time.

556
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:19,260
Now, since our comrades who've left the house have returned,

557
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:21,810
all we have left is to train diligently!

558
00:46:21,810 --> 00:46:24,200
Let's cheer up. Now, fighting!

559
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:27,250
Fighting!

560
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:29,490
Stop, stop, stop, just a minute!

561
00:46:30,490 --> 00:46:34,730
In celebration of our Coach Choi having returned, let's hear her speak a few words. Come out!

562
00:46:34,730 --> 00:46:38,490
It's fine. What would I have to say?

563
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:43,090
It's been a while, but we'll hear some words from our coach.

564
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:55,750
Kids, I don't have the right to face you all.

565
00:46:55,750 --> 00:46:59,680
I'm really sorry and I'm really thankful.

566
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:02,720
I really missed you all, seriously.

567
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:04,690
Ah, seriously...

568
00:47:04,690 --> 00:47:08,400
- Don't cry!
 - Don't cry! Don't cry!

569
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:11,800
You and the professor should do a love-shot on such a nice day like this.

570
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:14,130
- What love shot?
 - Forget it.

571
00:47:14,130 --> 00:47:17,070
Love shot! Love shot!

572
00:47:17,070 --> 00:47:19,620
- Love shot! 
 - Stop it!

573
00:47:19,620 --> 00:47:22,130
Fine, fine, fine!

574
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:25,610
You're really going to do it?

575
00:47:25,610 --> 00:47:27,910
Now.

576
00:47:27,910 --> 00:47:29,890
- You saw that, right?
 - Second stage!

577
00:47:29,890 --> 00:47:32,990
Second stage! Second stage!

578
00:47:32,990 --> 00:47:35,020
- Ah, seriously.
 - Second stage!

579
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:39,220
- Second stage?
 - Second stage! Second stage!

580
00:47:43,130 --> 00:47:45,180
Wait a moment!

581
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:54,520
Um, this arm, please just...

582
00:47:55,830 --> 00:47:58,840
What are you doing, you rascal?

583
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:02,620
Um,

584
00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:09,300
yes... We're dating.

585
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:12,220
- Coach.
 - What are they talking about?

586
00:48:12,220 --> 00:48:14,460
- What in the world?
 - Goodness...

587
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:17,520
We're dating. Seong Eun and I are dating.

588
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:18,760
  What?  

589
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:22,710
- Coach! 
 - What should we do?

590
00:48:24,290 --> 00:48:26,030
That's real swag.

591
00:48:26,030 --> 00:48:29,060
- What do we do?
 - Oh my god...

592
00:48:29,060 --> 00:48:33,160
Uncle! What are you doing right now? Are you crazy?

593
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:34,570
What? What did I do?

594
00:48:34,570 --> 00:48:37,900
How can you announce that by yourself without discussing it with me beforehand?!

595
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:41,390
I mean, it's not as if I made it up.

596
00:48:41,390 --> 00:48:43,110
Why are you so angry?

597
00:48:43,110 --> 00:48:48,140
- Bok Joo's uncle!
 - I'm not Bok Joo's uncle, I'm Kim Dae Ho. My name is Kim Dae Ho!

598
00:48:48,140 --> 00:48:51,230
And it's true that we're dating.

599
00:48:51,230 --> 00:48:52,900
Are we not dating, Seong Eun?

600
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:56,330
Uncle, I... I'm really sorry.

601
00:48:56,330 --> 00:48:59,640
I should have told you earlier but I was really drunk and—

602
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:02,400
What nonsense! We! We...

603
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:05,670
- We even kissed. 
 - I'm seriously going insane.

604
00:49:05,670 --> 00:49:09,900
If you kissed me, you need to take responsibility. You can't do this now.

605
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:11,900
Do you think kissing is a joke?

606
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:15,820
Uncle, I... I'm really, really sorry, okay?

607
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:19,860
You can hit me once right here. Hit me here, right here. Hit me, come on.

608
00:49:19,860 --> 00:49:21,370
- Come on, hit me. Just hit me and get it over with.
 - What's wrong with you?!

609
00:49:21,370 --> 00:49:24,280
Just hit me!

610
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:28,160
Ugh! I should really quit drinking or something...

611
00:49:28,870 --> 00:49:31,270
I'm seriously going insane.

612
00:49:31,270 --> 00:49:33,920
By any chance, are you like this because of the professor?

613
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:39,220
Is the professor the reason your heart

614
00:49:39,220 --> 00:49:41,560
can't come to me?

615
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:44,190
What are you talking about right now?

616
00:49:44,190 --> 00:49:48,690
- It's not like that. 
 - I-If it's not like that, then it's fine. I didn't hear anything,

617
00:49:48,690 --> 00:49:51,090
so I'm going to go straight towards you, just know that.

618
00:49:51,090 --> 00:49:52,960
Ah, Bok Joo's uncle!

619
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:58,100
Bok Joo's uncle!

620
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:09,920
What is this? Can she not pick up or is she just not choosing to pick up?

621
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:12,870
I hope she didn't go to the hospital because she got sick.

622
00:50:15,890 --> 00:50:18,730
- Did you eat a lot?
 - Of course, I did.

623
00:50:18,730 --> 00:50:21,080
Goodness.

624
00:50:21,710 --> 00:50:24,010
Hey, but it was a huge situation as soon as we got there!

625
00:50:24,010 --> 00:50:30,090
That's what I'm saying, but when do you think Bok Joo's uncle and our coach started having feelings for each other?

626
00:50:30,090 --> 00:50:32,230
I don't know. I didn't catch on at all either.

627
00:50:32,230 --> 00:50:36,470
If I had a romantic couple declaration like that, I would wish for nothing else.

628
00:50:36,470 --> 00:50:38,820
I'm so, so jealous! Seriously.

629
00:50:38,820 --> 00:50:40,270
"We're dating!"

630
00:50:40,270 --> 00:50:42,560
- Uncle! 
 - I know!

631
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:43,800
- They were so cute! 
 - I know!

632
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:46,800
You rascals! Is this the time for you to date?!

633
00:50:46,860 --> 00:50:49,390
It wouldn't be enough if you focused solely on weightlifting.

634
00:50:49,390 --> 00:50:52,250
It won't be too late for you to start dating slowly later on in life.

635
00:50:52,250 --> 00:50:56,360
Look at Bok Joo's uncle. I was worrying when he would become a proper human being

636
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:58,820
but he comes back with a nice woman.

637
00:50:58,820 --> 00:51:01,690
- Yes, yes, of course.
 - I'll remember your words.

638
00:51:01,690 --> 00:51:04,030
- Don't ever date! 
 - Yes!

639
00:51:07,060 --> 00:51:09,500
"We're dating!"

640
00:51:13,110 --> 00:51:15,370
Why aren't you answering your phone? Who is it?

641
00:51:15,370 --> 00:51:18,560
An unknown number keeps calling me, I don't know who the person is.

642
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:20,720
I guess it's spam.

643
00:51:21,260 --> 00:51:25,610
Hey, it's been a while since all three of us have gotten together. Should we hang out tonight?

644
00:51:25,610 --> 00:51:28,700
What about talking all night long in our room?

645
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:31,130
I even have some snacks I've hidden.

646
00:51:31,130 --> 00:51:33,410
Will you two be fine? Shouldn't you rest up tonight?

647
00:51:33,410 --> 00:51:35,540
I got a full-body heat massage so I'm fine.

648
00:51:35,540 --> 00:51:37,890
Athlete Kim, do you not feel well?

649
00:51:37,890 --> 00:51:39,940
Well, it's not bad but...

650
00:51:39,940 --> 00:51:43,920
I think my arms and legs are quite sore and my head is pounding.

651
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:47,520
Yeah, let's just rest up tonight and play grandly after training tomorrow.

652
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:50,960
- I, Lee Soon Ok, will treat you all tomorrow.
 - Okay, then you'll treat!

653
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:53,500
- Athlete Kim, go on in.
 - Yeah, yeah, go to sleep.

654
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:54,530
Yeah, goodnight.

655
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:57,000
- Hey, if you're scared because of your roommate, come to our room! 
 - Yeah, I know!

656
00:52:06,150 --> 00:52:08,520
Kids, I'm really sorry. I'm the wench who deserves to die.

657
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:14,820
Yeah, I know that I despise women who ignore their friends just because they have a boyfriend but let me date in peace, alright?

658
00:52:24,710 --> 00:52:27,010
Hey, why didn't you pick up your phone?!

659
00:52:27,010 --> 00:52:29,200
I didn't know you called.

660
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:33,300
Hey, of course, I did! I probably called you several dozen times.

661
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:35,570
Are you okay?

662
00:52:35,570 --> 00:52:40,650
It's just, aside from my body being sore and my feet being frozen, I'm fine overall.

663
00:52:41,550 --> 00:52:43,990
That's a relief.

664
00:52:43,990 --> 00:52:46,460
Want to meet for a minute?

665
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:50,910
Ah, because we have some time left until night attendance and I have something to give you as well.

666
00:53:06,350 --> 00:53:08,830
I said we should meet up at Toad's house. Why did you want to meet here?

667
00:53:08,830 --> 00:53:13,410
It's cold outside. I thought you were still sick.

668
00:53:14,650 --> 00:53:17,500
Here. I used it well.

669
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:21,500
What? Is this what you had to give me? I thought...

670
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:24,970
You could have taken your time giving this back to me.

671
00:53:25,780 --> 00:53:29,190
Then what did you expect? I don't have to pay you back for the hot pack, right?

672
00:53:29,190 --> 00:53:32,790
Hey, you don't have to repay me for the hot pack

673
00:53:32,790 --> 00:53:36,600
but let me know this. Why were you upset?

674
00:53:36,620 --> 00:53:38,470
U-Upset? Who was upset?

675
00:53:38,470 --> 00:53:41,270
You were upset and that's why you were irritated.

676
00:53:41,270 --> 00:53:44,530
When I think about it, I don't think you were upset over that pig comment.

677
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:49,240
Exactly what is it?! You have to tell me for me to know, you rascal!

678
00:53:51,750 --> 00:53:57,150
Hey, I wasn't planning on telling you this because it's just so childish...

679
00:53:58,830 --> 00:54:00,390
Tell me.

680
00:54:00,390 --> 00:54:03,170
You were really considerate towards your ex-girlfriend.

681
00:54:03,170 --> 00:54:06,530
Yeah, fine. I'll understand you being considerate to her since she's a patient,

682
00:54:06,530 --> 00:54:10,700
but how can you talk about her pollen allergy and make it obvious that you two dated before in front of me?

683
00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:14,250
And regardless of whether I was eating or not, you talked on the phone for so long in front of me!

684
00:54:14,250 --> 00:54:17,190
It had been minutes since you'd last seen each other. How could you have so much to talk about?!

685
00:54:17,190 --> 00:54:19,620
Hey, was that the reason?

686
00:54:19,620 --> 00:54:23,210
Yes, that's it! You are such a player bastard!

687
00:54:23,210 --> 00:54:25,920
Ah, seriously. Kim Bok Joo, I didn't see you like this.

688
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:30,450
You boasted so much about how childish jealousy wasn't your style

689
00:54:30,450 --> 00:54:34,950
but you're the goddess of jealousy. Goodness, how fresh.

690
00:54:34,950 --> 00:54:37,550
Are you teasing me?

691
00:54:37,550 --> 00:54:41,600
For Song Si Ho, putting the fact that she was my ex-girlfriend aside,

692
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:45,610
I acted like that because I was sorry I didn't answer her calls that day

693
00:54:45,610 --> 00:54:48,110
and we resolved everything before you came.

694
00:54:48,110 --> 00:54:51,530
She said she wanted to remain comfortably as friends.

695
00:54:51,530 --> 00:54:55,310
Your ex-girlfriend is your ex-girlfriend. What friendship?

696
00:54:55,310 --> 00:54:58,910
By that logic, then aren't you the same? You also have a past.

697
00:54:58,910 --> 00:55:02,120
Mine was just a one-sided crush! It's not the same as yours.

698
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:04,150
You're doing all sorts of things, Kim Bok Joo!

699
00:55:04,150 --> 00:55:07,220
Ugh, you're so cute! You're so cute I could die!

700
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:09,180
What's wrong with you? I don't like skinship.

701
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:11,070
Don't lie. You love it.

702
00:55:11,070 --> 00:55:14,520
- When did I ever?
 - Fine, I'll be careful from now on 
 ♬  Has the love that was once   ♬

703
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:18,650
so you have to make it obvious from now on. That's how I'll know.
 ♬   withered inside me  ♬

704
00:55:18,650 --> 00:55:20,420
Let's tell each other everything from now on.

705
00:55:20,420 --> 00:55:25,240
When we're having a hard time, when we're sad, even when we're embarrassed. 
 ♬   come back alive?   ♬

706
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:27,230
♬   You cause excitement   ♬

707
00:55:27,230 --> 00:55:31,960
Depending on what you do. 
 ♬   to my calm heart   ♬

708
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:35,100
Wow, this pin is really pretty. Who bought you this?

709
00:55:35,100 --> 00:55:36,540
Doctor Jae Yi.

710
00:55:36,540 --> 00:55:39,040
♬   Today more than yesterday   ♬

711
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:42,520

712
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:46,910
♬   if I just have you, I think I'll be happy   ♬

713
00:55:46,910 --> 00:55:48,680
Fine, come here.

714
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:52,200
Come here, come on. 
 ♬  I'll go pick you up wherever you are   ♬

715
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:55,660
- Are you not mad anymore?
 - Yes, I'm still mad.

716
00:55:55,660 --> 00:55:59,920
Really? 
 ♬  I hope I'm not late. I'll run to you   ♬

717

00:56:03,750 --> 00:56:09,850

719
00:56:09,850 --> 00:56:16,290
♬   I'll go to pick you up right now   ♬

720
00:56:20,730 --> 00:56:23,620
- Did you sleep well last night?
 - There are people here!

721
00:56:23,620 --> 00:56:25,830
- Did you dream of me?
 - What's wrong with you?!

722
00:56:25,830 --> 00:56:30,150
- Our Fatty can't get a cold.
 - Ah, seriously!

723
00:56:31,530 --> 00:56:33,690
Hey! Si Ho's coming.

724
00:56:33,690 --> 00:56:35,780
Unni!

725
00:56:41,060 --> 00:56:45,020
Are you getting discharged now? Give it to me.

726
00:56:48,810 --> 00:56:51,100
How's your health? Give me your bag.

727
00:56:51,100 --> 00:56:54,940
It's fine. If I can't even hold a bag, I shouldn't be discharged.

728
00:56:54,940 --> 00:56:58,390
You two seem quite close.

729
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:04,140
Still, you should try to not make it so obvious. You might make me relapse into my bitchery from jealousy.

730
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:07,860
No, we're not. We're not close at all.

731
00:57:07,860 --> 00:57:11,640
If not, then forget what I said. I'll leave first.

732
00:57:18,860 --> 00:57:21,360
Hey! Hey, seriously!

733
00:57:22,540 --> 00:57:24,200
You're cold, aren't you?

734
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:26,670
Let me see, come on. Come here.

735
00:57:34,250 --> 00:57:39,520
Ah! Jeong Joon Hyeong, you're doing so well! Just like you did before, don't even look at other girls,

736
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:41,740
just forget about manners,

737
00:57:41,740 --> 00:57:44,870
and you can't wear low-cut shirts that reveal your chest, understand?

738
00:57:44,870 --> 00:57:46,780
Yes, Noona Bok Joo.

739
00:57:46,780 --> 00:57:49,450
Ah, you're so pretty. Let's go!

740
00:57:50,420 --> 00:57:53,610
Ah! My arm hurts! My arm hurts.

741
00:57:53,620 --> 00:57:55,760
If you don't play, you lose! Rock-paper-scissor-shoo!

742
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:57,580
- You lost.
 - What? What is this?

743
00:57:57,580 --> 00:58:02,380
It's a forehead hit, what else could it be? Come on, give me your forehead.

744
00:58:03,660 --> 00:58:07,730
- Fine, you really want to have a go at this?
 - If you don't play, you lose! Rock-paper-scissor-shoo!

745
00:58:07,730 --> 00:58:10,870
Come here, come here.

746
00:58:10,870 --> 00:58:13,440
If you don't play, you lose, rock-paper-scissor-shoo!

747
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:18,400
You're dead.

748
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:21,680
- Hey, wait. Wait, do it gently.
 - Don't avoid it. You'll get hit twice if you avoid it.

749
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:25,680
Fine, fine. I lost on purpose.

750
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:30,860
Hey, that must really hurt! I'm sorry, I'm really sorry! I couldn't control my strength. I'm so sorry!

751
00:58:30,860 --> 00:58:33,860
- Ah, that really hurts.
 - I'm sorry, that must really hurt.
