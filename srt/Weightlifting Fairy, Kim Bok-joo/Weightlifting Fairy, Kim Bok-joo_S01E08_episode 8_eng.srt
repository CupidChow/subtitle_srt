1
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:35,230


2
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:38,140
Joon Hyeong, it's me.

3
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:42,510
Ah, what do I tell the doctor?

4
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:48,840
Hey, what are you? Why do you keep calling Joon Hyeong? Why do you keep meeting up with him?

5
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,610
You said that you have someone else you like so why do you keep flirting with Joon Hyeong?!

6
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:55,780
Flirting? What are you talking about right now?

7
00:00:55,780 --> 00:01:00,450
I was the one who placed your obesity clinic record book in the Weightlifting Room.

8
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:05,020
What?! Wh-what did you say?

9
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:10,610
So, you intentionally placed that record book there?

10
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:12,690
Yeah, I did it.

11
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:16,920
Why? Wh-why? Wh-why would you do that to me?

12
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,990
Because I was so angry that you were close to Joon Hyeong, because you bothered me.

13
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:23,550
What? Wow, I'm so speechless right now—

14
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:27,810
Yeah! I even intentionally told you that I wanted to start fresh with him again.

15
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:29,480
That was a warning. Did you not realize that?

16
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:32,400
Why are you next to him every single time I want to be next to him?!

17
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,440
You said that you liked someone else. Are you managing fish in your collection (playing the field)?

18
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:39,810
Excuse me, I don't know what "managing fish" you're talking about,

19
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:42,750
and I don't have the slightest intention to manage Jeong  Joon Hyeong!

20
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:45,240
He doesn't see me as a woman either.

21
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,080
He has so many vision-distorted women around him, like you, so would he have gone crazy to like me?!

22
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:50,480
Then I'm just misunderstanding everything?

23
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,650
Yes! You're misunderstanding everything

24
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:55,340
and shouldn't you apologize to me before you argue about those details?

25
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:59,680
No, I don't want to apologize to you. Joon Hyeong already attacked me enough because of you.

26
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,150
It's not because of me. It's because of you.

27
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:04,950
Wow, you're really a strong opponent.

28
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:09,760
Now I realize why Jeong Joon Hyeong hates you so much, why he won't accept you.

29
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:15,420
You're freakin two-faced.

30
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:19,840
Hey, what do you know? What do you know that you dare to speak carelessly about our relationship?

31
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,410
Yeah, I don't know. I'm not interested either and I don't want to talk to you, so let go of me.

32
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:26,020
I'm going to sleep in another room.

33
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:29,160
Our relationship was deep. That's why Joon Hyeong was hurt too.

34
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:32,010
I said I got it so let go of me!

35
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:37,570
Hey, hey, hey...

36
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:39,710
Aish, what is this? Aren't you going to let go of me? Let go!

37
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:42,600
Hey, what are you to look down on our relationship? What are you?!

38
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:46,130
Ah, I'm the one who should be getting mad right now. Let go of me!

39
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:48,680
Really, I am dumbfounded!

40
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:05,130
Lee Soon Ok, until when are you going to be like this?

41
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:09,060
I told you earlier, we really didn't mean to outcast you.

42
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:11,880
I just found out recently too...

43
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,700
Let me sleep here for tonight.

44
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,820
What's with you again?

45
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:24,120
Why sleep here when you have your own room?

46
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,260
I don't know! I'm having a complete mental breakdown right now.

47
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:30,040
I'll tell the head resident to switch my room when an empty room is available, so let me stay here for a while.

48
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:33,510
Goodness, did you fight with Song Si Ho?

49
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:36,010
By any chance, did you beat her up?

50
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:40,250
What do you mean "beat up"? It was a one-sided fight and I was the victim!

51
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:44,880
Hey, Athlete Lee. At least pretend to acknowledge that I'm here.

52
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,050
Are you still upset?

53
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:53,750
Yeah, everything's because of me. Don't be mad anymore, please?

54
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,710
Why did you fight with Song Si Ho? Tell me.

55
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:06,820
I don't know. Really, I am dumbfounded.

56
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:19,330
 Fatty 

57
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:21,880
 If you want to check the recent contact times with this contact, please allow the access to the recent calls at the contact app. 

58
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:26,040
Pointlessly because of me, seriously...

59
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:35,000
 Episode 8
The Wind is Blowing 

60
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,820
What? Then Song Si Ho was the reason you got caught?

61
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,510
That's what I'm saying.

62
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:44,280
Wow. Hey, you know, she's skilled in making people tired of her.

63
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,530
Even while telling me what she did, she was so confident.

64
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:51,890
Aish, how can there be such a woman? It's pissing me off. I should just smack—

65
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:54,070
I did everything I could do, just lie down.

66
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:59,370
No wonder. I thought that she was different from the other RG Department members, but it turns out that it was all just a pretense.

67
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:02,780
Of course. She is a part of the RG Department. There's no way she would have gotten along with us.

68
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:08,390
What did I tell you? I told you that there wasn't just something cool about her.

69
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,310
What?

70
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:19,000
Hey, Bok Joo, I'm sorry. I did wrong. I really, really, really committed a sin worthy of death. I really...

71
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,350
I'll buy you the meat that you like. I'll—

72
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:23,420
That's not it.

73
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:27,890
Come here, come right here. Hey, I'm sorry.

74
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:32,320
I'll buy you meat. Ah, that's not it either.

75
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:36,080
Hey, I'm s-s—

76
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:42,680
Why did you want to meet in the middle of the night? If we caught by the night-attendance teacher, are you going to take responsibility?

77
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:47,160
I mean, our call ended abruptly earlier so...

78
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,490
Did something happen?

79
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:54,890
Jeong Joon Hyeong, will you please stop being interested in me? Please?

80
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:58,110
I don't want to be misunderstood over nothing.

81
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:03,110
By any chance, did Song Si Ho tell you?

82
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,370
She told you.

83
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:10,810
I'm saying this because we're already on the topic. I wonder if I'll be able to talk to you anymore because I'm scared of her.

84
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:13,020
I'm really sorry for many reasons.

85
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:17,200
Yeah! You need to be sorry. Because of you, I...

86
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:23,460
I had an argument with Song Si Ho and  I'm so pissed off.  I might get  Hwabyeong   (Suppressed Anger Syndrome).

87
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:25,510
I'm sorry, Fatty.

88
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,920
Well, it's fine.

89
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:33,020
What part of you did that unni like?

90
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:38,570
Well, I have so many charms, there are too many to tell.

91
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:41,160
Are you really going to fuel my anger?

92
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,770
Hey!

93
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,480
Did she leave?

94
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:57,290
I think so.

95
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:02,070
Hey, look at this! If we're caught like this, both you and I will be uselessly misunderstood.

96
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:06,380
If we're careless, I could get  my hair ripped out by your ex-girlfriend. Do better!

97
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:08,070
So, are you afraid?

98
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:10,590
Afraid? Why would I be afraid of that chopstick?

99
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:14,120
I'm the Weightlifting Athlete, Kim Bok Joo. What's wrong with you?

100
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:18,140
This is nice.

101
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:20,690
What's nice about this? It's cold. Aren't we going to go?

102
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,340
Go where? Stay here just a bit longer.

103
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:25,800
Hey, look. There are so many stars in the sky, look at those.

104
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,680
Are you sure they're stars, not satellites?

105
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,270
Hey, there are so many stars. How can there be so many satellites?

106
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:32,880
- Is that so?
 - Ugh.

107
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,240
- It's so cold.  
 - Yeah, it's cold. I want to leave.

108
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,560
No, just stay here a bit longer.

109
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,850
Ah, I only wore this scarf before coming out.

110
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:40,780
You mean you "put on" the scarf.

111
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:43,690
Whatever. You have this warm jacket on.

112
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:46,930
- What? Then do you want to come into my embrace? 
 - Forget it!

113
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:49,030
What? Stay here a bit longer.

114
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:51,200
- Hey, your nose bridge is really high.
 - What?

115
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:54,640
I'm envious. Whenever I wear glasses, they always slip down.

116
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,950
- Why?
 - Because I don't have a nose.

117
00:07:56,950 --> 00:08:03,430
Hey, looking at you up close, it's worth looking at you.

118
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:05,100
- Are you making fun of me because I'm dumb? 
 - No, you're pretty.

119
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:11,890
United!

120
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:23,090
Why are you panting after running that?

121
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:26,700
- You're athletes only in name. 
 -  It's too hard.

122
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:31,490
Forget it. Today, in preparation for the competition next month, we'll

123
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:35,750
do hardcore training in level 4. Go inside and warm up adequately. Go!

124
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,790
I'm so irritated!

125
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:43,600
- Come on.  Hurry. 
 - Hurry get in!

126
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,510
- Coach Choi.  
 - Yes, Professor?

127
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:51,690
Don't make a habit of drinking alone. If it becomes a habit, you'll become addicted later.

128
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:56,790
That's just because I was so tired. I was going to just have two cans and then go home and sleep.

129
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:01,200
- Drink with me. You're free tonight, right? 
  - What?

130
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,140
What? You don't want to drink with a comfortable old man?

131
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,830
I was planning to treat you.

132
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:10,070
Yes, well...I like that.

133
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:14,510
Okay. After training, let's go out, to the street vendor bar where we went last time. Their roasted hogfish was delicious.

134
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:26,070
Si Ho!

135
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:28,760
- Yes?
 - Here. It's a present from me.

136
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,720
I sent you the edited video clips of the Moscow competition by e-mail

137
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:35,820
Look at them carefully. It'll help you prepare for that competition.

138
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:39,040
- Do well.
- Thank you.

139
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,840
Can we see right through Coach?

140
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,720
How can she butter up Si Ho like that after one competition?

141
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,690
I guess her affection for her has made a comeback.

142
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:49,450
Ah, she only loved our Soo Bin for such a short while.

143
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:52,020
It won't last long.

144
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:56,410
Would a dish that's been broken last for a long time just because you roughly glued it back together?

145
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:06,020
Why isn't Mom answering the phone?

146
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:09,910
Si Eun!

147
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:12,840
- Unni.
 - What's going on? You didn't even call me.

148
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,800
Unni.

149
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:20,080
- What's wrong? Did something happen?
 - I think that Mom and Dad

150
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:22,370
are going to get a divorce.

151
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:26,330
- What?
 - They're always fighting these days.

152
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:32,290
Dad doesn't come home. I think they're really going to get a divorce this time.

153
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:39,630
It's okay, Si Eun. Don't cry. Don't cry. It's okay.

154
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:43,740
I'll take care of it, okay? Alright, stop crying.

155
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:48,880
I told Si Eun so many times not to tell you.

156
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,580
If she hadn't told me, then when were you planning on telling me?

157
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:54,710
After you and Dad had stamped the divorce papers?

158
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:58,420
Or after you and Dad had already separated and remarried?

159
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:01,900
Or were you planning on keeping it a secret from me forever?!

160
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:05,650
Why are you yelling at me? Your face is well-known.

161
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:08,890
What's important about that right now?

162
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:13,170
I heard the house was completely taken away, and Dad has been a credit delinquent for a long time.

163
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:16,570
It's okay. Don't you worry about it.

164
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:20,350
Don't worry about your dad and I getting a divorce. Just focus on your own affairs.

165
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:23,230
How could I not worry about it? You're my parents.

166
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:27,930
- Si Ho.
 - I'm going to quit gymnastics. I'll just work to earn money.

167
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:30,880
With whose permission? With whose permission will you quit?

168
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,030
Do you think that your life is only yours? It's not.

169
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:36,160
Your life is my life, too.

170
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:40,330
Receiving other people's fingers (blamed) that I overdrive my daughter, fighting with your dad every day,

171
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:44,820
and being resented by Si Eun, I've endured my life. How about my life?!

172
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:48,340
That was the hardest thing for me.

173
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:52,020
The fact that my life is your life.

174
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:55,980
Why are you using my life as collateral for your greed?

175
00:11:55,980 --> 00:12:00,620
If you wanted it so, you should've just lived well by yourself. Why did you bear a daughter and go through all this trouble?

176
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:23,540
Seriously, what kind of son barges in the house in the middle of the night and asks me to make him curry?

177
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:27,310
Hey, I told you. I suddenly thought of your curry, Mom.

178
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:35,020
Just as I thought. Because of this curry, it looks like I won't be able to marry another woman.

179
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:39,150
Hey, that's your mom's method. That's how she got another victim right here.

180
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:45,010
If you thought that way, you should've married a cook. Why did you marry a pharmacist?

181
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:48,740
Hey, it feels like I said something wrong, doesn't it?

182
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:51,480
Yes, I think you did.

183
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:55,070
Oh, she's coming. She's coming, she's coming.

184
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:58,160
Aigoo, why are you sitting in somebody else's spot?

185
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,880
Why are you acting like that? I just said it as a joke.

186
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:04,010
Wait, what about mine?

187
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:06,390
You have a pot belly.

188
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:09,390
Really, you have a pot belly.

189
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:11,560
I paid for the food.

190
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,510
Ah, I should just eat.

191
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:15,710
Enjoy the food, Son.

192
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:30,150
If I tell you the results first,

193
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:32,920
- I screwed up.
- Why? Why?

194
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:39,050
I thought that it would be fine if I tried to control my mind through my breathing.

195
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:44,290
I have to get a refund of  the treatment fee.

196
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:47,470
Heol. I can't do that. I've got to make a living too.

197
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:51,510
Alright, I'll treat you to a meal just once. So don't spread rumors about this, okay?

198
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,620
Alright then.

199
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:00,030
Let's consider it as having done a warm-up.

200
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:02,750
We'll definitely be able to find a good answer.

201
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:06,480
If we can't find it within this year, then I'm a failure. I'm pretty old too.

202
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,040
That's right. You are in a period when your performance is supposed to be peaking.

203
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:13,530
Don't worry. Be happy.

204
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:21,970
But about what you said. I'm talking about your biological mother, not your current parents.

205
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:24,740
Have you never thought of trying to find her?

206
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:30,820
I haven't.

207
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:33,060
Why? You must have been curious.

208
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:39,490
- Mom cut off contact, so she must have had her own reasons.
 - Yeah.

209
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:43,860
Also, I think that I felt sorry toward my aunt and uncle.

210
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:46,150
Because it felt like you were betraying them?

211
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:52,250
My aunt really raised me with all her heart.

212
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:54,980
Alright, I think I know what it is.

213
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:02,500
But I think that you should directly face everything.

214
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:05,340
There's your resentment toward your mother,

215
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:10,170
as well as your complicated emotions towards your family members, such as gratitude,

216
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:14,620
contrition, and the fatigue you feel from pretending not to know even though you do.

217
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:17,300
Maybe you should let those emotions explode at least once

218
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:21,940
to become free from that trauma that you have.

219
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:24,380
That's what I think.

220
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:40,830
I have to give the doctor a call.

221
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:44,990
Ah, Lee Soon Ok. Look at me and eat this.

222
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:47,670
Forget it. I told you I'm not eating it.

223
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:53,730
Would you move aside? This is still my bed even though you feel this bed's owner doesn't exist.

224
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:55,740
Y-Yeah.

225
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:04,630
But Soon Ok, you should stop it now.

226
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:08,270
I understand that you're hurt, but we really didn't leave you out on purpose.

227
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:10,060
You probably did.

228
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:14,520
The person who threw a stone didn't mean it. But  I'm the one who exaggerates the pain.

229
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:18,960
- That's not it!
 - No, it's my fault because of my narrow mind.

230
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:23,130
I'm sorry that I've got such an unsatisfactory personality where I don't think that it's understandable for you to be like that.

231
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:25,950
Hey, are you really going to keep talking like this?!

232
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:29,380
Aigoo, why are you yelling like that? You'll get into a fight if you keep going.

233
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:31,680
This wench, she is so crooked!

234
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,360
If you bring it out like this, I'm also very upset about you.

235
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,110
Hey, Kim Bok Joo. Are you getting mad at me right now?

236
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:38,430
As a matter of fact, I'm so disturbed, but you even add to the aggravation!

237
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:42,990
It's said, "The pot calls the kettle black." You're exactly in this situation. Do you think I enjoy doing this?

238
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:47,070
- Then just stop it, you wench!
 - I can't stop myself! What are you going to do, you wench?!

239
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:49,220
 You guys, too noisy! Go out and fight!!  

240
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:53,200
Ah, seriously. Do you want to get chased out by the head resident?

241
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,200
Have you two ever thought about me even once?

242
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:07,090
I considered you two as like my real sisters while I was living this student life in this unfamiliar Seoul.

243
00:17:07,090 --> 00:17:08,720
But it was my own misunderstanding.

244
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,260
Don't overreact to something like this. We're all the same.

245
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:17,230
Bok Joo only told me because I found out accidentally while reading her text message.

246
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:20,150
Then you should have told me when she got caught by Coach.

247
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:22,190
Nan Hee, what did you tell me by pretending not to know anything?

248
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:26,400
You told me to argue with Bok Joo about it later because she's having a hard time right now. You just made me inconsiderate.

249
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,940
That's not Nan Hee's fault. I asked her to keep it a secret.

250
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,100
That's why I'm asking why you made a secret in our relationship!

251
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:34,430
Do you think I did it because I wanted to?!

252
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:38,860
It was really hard for me to keep it secret too! I wanted to spill everything to you several times every day!

253
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:40,690
But how could I say that?

254
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:43,800
But how could I say it? I knew how ridiculous my actions were!

255
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:47,530
It was obvious that you'd reproach me, even though we're friends! How could I tell you that when it's so embarrassing?!

256
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:50,160
Hey, what's embarrassing about that amongst friends?

257
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,890
When you're friends, you understand things like that and talk about it. That's what a friend is. Is that how shallow our friendship is?

258
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:58,030
Soon Ok is right, you wench.

259
00:17:58,030 --> 00:18:02,590
I'm sorry! I was worried that you guys would be disappointed in me and think that I'm pathetic.

260
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:06,490
Hey, I'm sorry. Hey, why are you crying?

261
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:09,050
Hey, it must have been so hard on you!

262
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:11,630
Guys.

263
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:16,450
I won't keep secrets from you anymore. I promise!

264
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:19,500
If you're crying, I'll be sad.

265
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:25,030
Hey, remember when I said my family runs a business at our house in Daejeon?

266
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:30,320
It's not just a business. It's actually a motel. I couldn't tell you guys because I was embarrassed.

267
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,990
Hey! What's wrong with a motel that you would hide something like that?

268
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:39,230
You don't know how I feel when I bring a plate of yogurt and a wet towel to customers our age.

269
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:45,060
I... have never gotten even a peck kiss, nothing near a deep kiss.

270
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:52,050
- What's important about that?
 - Yeah!

271
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:53,340
What's important about that, seriously?

272
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,910
That's a foolish thing to do.

273
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:02,170
I'm really sorry, guys!

274
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:07,840
I wasn't  really trying to outcast you.

275
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:13,650
I was really too embarrassed to tell you.

276
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:16,310
Ow, it's hot.

277
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:23,310
Eat slowly. You'll get indigestion again.

278
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:26,830
I might get diarrhea, but I never get indigestion.

279
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,390
- What is getting indigestion?
 - Swag!

280
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:31,900
As expected, it tastes the best when I eat with you guys.

281
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,880
- We have to mix in rice, don't we? 
 - Of course, we have to.

282
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:34,770
Two servings?

283
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:37,020
Since I cried, I'm hungry. So three!

284
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:40,100
Ahjumma, three bowls of rice, please!

285
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:42,210
Hey, tomorrow it's the weekend anyway.

286
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:45,490
Should we go out and play around? What do you think?

287
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:49,200
Who are you trying to give a hard time again? And Bok Joo has to work overtime.

288
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,960
Ah, that's right. You won't have any weekends free for a while, Kim Bok Joo.

289
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:55,930
Coach and Professor are giving up their weekends because of me. I should work hard and follow them.

290
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:57,680
That's a shame.

291
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:01,110
Then should we eat least hit up the noraebang one time?

292
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:03,590
I got really stressed out because of Song Si Ho.

293
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:07,620
Oh yeah, that's right. Song SI Ho, I had a really hard time pretending not to know. Why I should just—

294
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:11,110
Ah, stop, stop! Why would we waste our energy on her? Huh?

295
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:14,410
Hurry up and eat, then let's go hit up a noraebang.

296
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:18,120
This unni will treat you to a noraebang!

297
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,970
Let's go.

298
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:27,280
Ah, yes.

299
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,590
What shall we do, eat dinner separately or just eat the side dishes as a dinner?

300
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:35,220
Just let's go directly there. If we eat dinner separately, I won't be able to drink any alcohol because I'll be so full.

301
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:40,520
Why are you trying to gulp down alcohol? How scary.

302
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:44,370
I'm confessing in advance that I can't match you in drinking.

303
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:49,810
Not really. When I needed to be alert, I drank. That's why I looked like sober.

304
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:53,040
So you're saying that you're going to drink until drunk today.

305
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,850
Ah, it sounds really scary.

306
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:56,990
That's not it, Professor!

307
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:59,600
Ah, seriously. What do you view me as?

308
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,510
Oh, Honey.

309
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:03,520
How?

310
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:08,200
That's why I told you not to drive the car around at night. You're not used to driving.

311
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,230
You're not hurt anywhere?

312
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:13,000
Okay. I'll head there right away.

313
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,170
Stop crying.

314
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:16,770
Okay.

315
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:19,350
Is that your wife?

316
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:21,870
Yeah. I think she got in a fender-bender.

317
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:25,810
What should I do? I think I'll have to leave right now.

318
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:26,960
Did she get hurt really badly?

319
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,660
No, that's not it.

320
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:32,370
It seems like she got really shocked. She gets frightened easily.

321
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:36,160
Hey, I was planning to buy something for you for the first time in a long time.

322
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,530
No. Hurry up and go to her.

323
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:42,880
Alright. I'll head there now. I'll treat you to something delicious next time.

324
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,300
Oh, where are my car keys?

325
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:46,130
- In your hand.
 - Oh.

326
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:47,440
I'm leaving.

327
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,670
Yes. Be careful on your way.

328
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:54,790
- Hello!
 - Yes, hello—

329
00:21:56,610 --> 00:21:58,480
Why did you come alone today?

330
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,300
Why? I can't come alone?

331
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,670
Do I have to come with Bok Joo?

332
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:06,540
It seems like you came after one round of drinking somewhere.

333
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:08,970
Please give me pupa stew and a bottle of soju.

334
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:10,770
Yes!

335
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:19,030
Thank you.

336
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:24,440
But something seems a little different about you.

337
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,350
Ah, seriously!

338
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:29,510
Your make-up is flaky. Flaky!

339
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:33,050
You were planning on going to a date and got stood up, didn't you?

340
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:35,070
Seriously, you really...

341
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,110
Why didn't you give me pupa stew?

342
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:40,340
I just put it on the stove. It's got to cook.

343
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:45,700
Ah, I might get magnesium carbonate powder on my skin.

344
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:49,350
Why are you sitting down?

345
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:52,970
It's not like I'm sitting on your lap. These chairs belong to my house!

346
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:56,430
I was trying to be your friend since I felt bad that you were drinking alone.

347
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:58,350
Have you always been this crooked?

348
00:22:58,350 --> 00:23:00,520
Then have you always been this nosy, Uncle?

349
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:04,660
You talk back to everything. You don't let a single word get by.

350
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:10,830
Drink it a bit more moderately, please.

351
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:13,750
I've always been a big drinker.

352
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:20,770
Big drinker, my foot. You don't look like you're that good at drinking.

353
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:55,710
Oh, snot's coming out.

354
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:57,750
Ow, my head.

355
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,360
 Bok Chicken 

356
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,470
It's Bok Joo.

357
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:40,560
Ah, good morning Coach Choi.

358
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:43,960
Sunbae, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry, really.

359
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:48,800
Why are you acting like that, Coach Choi? We can drink alcohol and sleep over with our relationship.

360
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:52,020
Sit down over there. Relieve a hangover with some bean sprout soup then leave.

361
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:55,820
No, I committed a huge indiscretion. I'll just get going.

362
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:59,250
This old sunbae got up early in the morning and prepared hangover soup.

363
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:01,330
Go sit down over there!

364
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:08,990
You're up?

365
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:17,700
Sit down too. Have some hangover soup. Come on, sit down.

366
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:21,160
Yeah, I have to, of course.

367
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:33,880
Excuse me. Did I make any mistakes last night?

368
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,400
What?

369
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:39,290
D-D-Did something happen?

370
00:25:39,290 --> 00:25:42,940
Um, I-I also blacked out from around the middle.

371
00:25:48,010 --> 00:25:50,790
Wow, how can the soup taste like soju?

372
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:59,130
 Rock, paper, scissor, shoo! 

373
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:06,070
 Rock, paper, scissor, shoo! 

374
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,830
  Coach. 

375
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:21,080
 Coach. 

376
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:27,420
I'm the crazy one.

377
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:30,850
How could I fall asleep there?

378
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:34,410
Ugh, I'm so humiliated. Seriously...

379
00:26:34,410 --> 00:26:36,090
Coach Choi.

380
00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:38,300
That scared me.

381
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:42,980
- Didn't you wear the same thing yesterday? Did you not go home last night?
 - No, that's not it!

382
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:46,700
I like these clothes, so I have several of them.

383
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:49,340
Those clothes don't look like the type that you would buy multiple pairs of.

384
00:26:56,530 --> 00:26:58,920
45 kg. Pass.

385
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:06,450
It doesn't make sense that there isn't a single one whose weight increased.

386
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:09,890
and there's no way the scale would lie.

387
00:27:09,890 --> 00:27:12,640
Scale, scale.

388
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:16,550
You had something like this?

389
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,240
Of course. What is this?

390
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:23,630
Do you think I didn't use the same trick when I was an athlete?

391
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:25,750
Who initiated this?

392
00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:29,830
Look at you. You're not going to tattle-tale on her?

393
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:36,200
I got it. From tomorrow, we'll switch to a very precise digital scale.

394
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:55,170
What are you doing? Will that break like that? Move.

395
00:27:58,630 --> 00:28:01,330
Break, break!

396
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:07,680
Were you shocked? It's just me.

397
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:14,600
What are you doing here at this hour, Unni?

398
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,850
I just wanted to practice.

399
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:22,160
Hey, Kim Bok Joo! Your butt, don't push your butt out! Just go up in that position.

400
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:28,450
You have to maintain your position when you weight lift from the squatting position. Do it again. Posture.

401
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:31,910
Now, hold.

402
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,100
Goodness! Delivery is here, Professor Yoon and Coach Choi!

403
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:44,270
- Welcome.
 - Senior, welcome.

404
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:48,780
What to do? You can't even rest on the weekends because of my Bok Joo.

405
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:52,310
I brought this much so you can eat it for a while.

406
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:56,020
Goodness, this is something we should do as a given. I apologize.

407
00:28:56,020 --> 00:29:00,020
- Coach Choi.
 - Yes? Ah, yes.

408
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,720
Coach Choi, I saw you this morning. It's our second time meeting today, isn't it?

409
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:08,100
Professor, I'll put this inside. If the kids see this, they'll eat it all once.

410
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:09,400
Alright.

411
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:12,300
- Just a minute, um.
 - Yes, yes.

412
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:15,070
Yes, excuse me.

413
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:17,390
Hey, you rascal! You're working hard, aren't you?

414
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:21,110
She's working hard. Don't worry too much about her.

415
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:22,690
You must be hungry. Do it after eating, Professor Yoon.

416
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:25,680
- Ah, yes.
 - Captain! Come here, let's eat together.

417
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,960
  Doctor Jeong Jae Yi 

418
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:34,840
Excuse me, I have to use the bathroom.

419
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:04,260
Yes, Ms. Bok Joo?

420
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:07,750
Doctor, I'm sorry I couldn't answer your calls.

421
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:12,520
I thought you would reschedule your appointment for this week and come but there was no contact.

422
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,960
- Nothing's wrong, right?
 - No.

423
00:30:17,330 --> 00:30:20,330
Um, actually, Doctor...

424
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:22,210
  You can tell me at  ease, it's okay. 

425
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:30,530
In fact, I don't think I'll be able to come to the clinic anymore.

426
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:35,330
You won't be able to come at all anymore? Why?

427
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:37,050
In fact,

428
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:40,950
I'm going abroad, Doctor.

429
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:44,790
Abroad. I guess you're going to study the cello.

430
00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:47,250
Where are you going to? Germany?

431
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:49,130
Yes, Germany...

432
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:52,590
Ah, that's good.

433
00:30:53,530 --> 00:30:55,380
I should congratulate you,

434
00:30:55,380 --> 00:31:00,750
but I feel slightly upset. I feel as if I'm sending off a close friend.

435
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:04,950
Anyway, congratulations. Go and study music diligently,

436
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:09,410
but later when you become famous, you can't pretend not to know me. You have to give me your autograph too.

437
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:11,560
Yes.

438
00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:14,010
Doctor, you should stay healthy too.

439
00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:17,600
Yeah. Bok Joo, you can do it!

440
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:47,180
Stop crying, Kim Bok Joo. This isn't something to cry about. Stop crying...

441
00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:14,690
- Yeah, Fatty.
 - Hey, it's me.

442
00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:19,290
I know it's you. Why are you setting up an atmosphere? Is something wrong?

443
00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:25,790
I just called the Doctor and told him that I won't be able to go the clinic anymore.

444
00:32:25,790 --> 00:32:27,680
Hey, what did he say?

445
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:32,290
Well, just the usual...

446
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:35,880
Hey, did you cry?

447
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:40,810
Where are you right now? Are you outside?

448
00:32:40,810 --> 00:32:44,830
No, no. I'm stuck in my room. Where are you right now?

449
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:55,040
So, what do you wish for these days?

450
00:32:56,170 --> 00:33:00,500
I wish that the person I like will like me back,

451
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:02,960
but that's ruined.

452
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:06,850
I just do this because I've always done it. If I don't do it, I feel upset.

453
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:09,620
What reason did you give my brother for not being able to go anymore?

454
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:14,730
I told him that I was going abroad... for the cello.

455
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:19,790
Goodness, you worked hard in matching the details in your story.

456
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:22,560
Don't laugh. Whose fault is th—

457
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:26,570
Hey, I'm sorry for many reasons. Because of me...

458
00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:30,520
Forget it. Everything has already happened, so what can we do about it?

459
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:34,460
People aren't wrong, but love is.

460
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:39,190
Look at you. You had a one-sided love but at this rate, you might become a poet.

461
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:42,690
When you get to know me, I'm quite emotional. What's wrong with you?

462
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:49,120
To be honest, what I'm really upset about is...

463
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:56,540
that until the end, I had no choice but to be a liar to him.

464
00:33:57,350 --> 00:34:00,740
I wanted to tell the truth to him, at least once.

465
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:03,770
Hey, don't think too much. Your head will hurt.

466
00:34:03,770 --> 00:34:06,680
Hey, just think that you had a strong first-love and forget about it.

467
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:09,680
I heard that for women, their last love is more important than their first love.

468
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:12,030
Will love come again?

469
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:15,220
I think I'm just going to exercise for the rest of my life and die.

470
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:17,110
Why are you torturing yourself?

471
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:20,460
I'm not torturing myself, I'm reminding myself of where I belong.

472
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:24,620
I wonder if I should just get my head straight and focus on weightlifting.

473
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:32,370
Hey, what time does your training end today? Should we go to the club again? You have to treat this time.

474
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:36,140
Forget it. Let's do it next time. I lack stamina right now.

475
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:40,480
Then do you want to see a movie? I'll treat you to the full course, including the popcorn and drink!

476
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:44,360
Movie? Really?

477
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:48,840
Usually, I don't watch movies with female friends because it's a waste of time,

478
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:52,830
but I've committed some sins. You gave to the toad,

479
00:34:52,830 --> 00:34:57,150
and I know about give-and-take. So, how about it?

480
00:34:58,050 --> 00:34:59,800
You're going to see it with me, right?

481
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:02,110
What time?

482
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:05,610
♬    Hello  ♬

483
00:35:08,490 --> 00:35:11,150
- I want to see it.
-  What about you? Bok Sil, 

484
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:13,840
  which moment do you remember the most? 

485
00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:19,430
  What? Do you want to die? 

486
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:24,600
 This moment right now. 

487
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,450
 I'm not going anywhere. 

488
00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:29,570
 What about the disabled? 
 Isn't it an old man? 

489
00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:33,970
 No, today's theme is just a little... 

490
00:35:38,350 --> 00:35:40,400
Welcome.

491
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,020
I think I've got indigestion.

492
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:44,610
You don't look good.

493
00:35:44,610 --> 00:35:49,330
Try this. If you don't get better, then I think it would be best for you to go to the hospital.

494
00:35:49,330 --> 00:35:51,980
I understand.

495
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:53,780
 Pharmacy 

496
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:07,950
Omo, what to do?! Student, are you okay?

497
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,940
This came from Canada.

498
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:15,300
It's not that long until Christmas.

499
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:20,710
How comes she never skips even for one year? Anyhow, she really thinks about Joon Hyeong a lot.

500
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:22,780
What are you doing? Go ahead and open it.

501
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:27,550
I should take a look at it. What is it this year?

502
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:36,620
Oh, wow! It's so pretty!

503
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:38,500
Hey, isn't this totally your style?

504
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:43,100
I know, right? It looks like the latest edition. Hurry up and try it on.

505
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:52,940
Oh, it fits perfectly!

506
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:54,870
Of course, it does!

507
00:36:57,670 --> 00:37:02,480
Aigoo, that's right. How could the size fit perfectly? It's like she's seen you herself.

508
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:07,010
How fascinating! I guess a son is still a son, even if you're far away.

509
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:09,870
- I know, right?
 - Mom, I'm going to head out right now.

510
00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:14,080
- Why aren't you eating?
 - I'm sorry. I'll eat next time.

511
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:23,370
I guess they fit too well. We should have gotten it in a slightly bigger size.

512
00:37:23,370 --> 00:37:27,580
Why would we get a bigger size just for that? He wouldn't be able to wear them then.

513
00:37:35,810 --> 00:37:40,780
 But haven't you ever thought about finding your mom? 

514
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:45,830
 But I think that you need to face everything head on. 

515
00:38:16,490 --> 00:38:18,270
Yeah, why?

516
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:28,020
Ah, it's almost time for the movie to start. Why isn't he here yet? Is he trying to die, seriously?

517
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:31,030
Ah, should I buy the tickets beforehand?

518
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:39,060
Ah, they're seriously so annoying! They should just go get a motel if they want to keep doing like that.

519
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:54,350
Are you still dizzy?

520
00:38:54,350 --> 00:38:57,010
You'll get better since you got a shot.

521
00:38:57,010 --> 00:39:02,240
Sorry. When it was urgent, you were the only one that I thought of.

522
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:05,990
Isn't it better for you to go home than to go to the dorm?

523
00:39:05,990 --> 00:39:08,820
Mom and Dad said they're getting a divorce.

524
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:11,400
The house will probably be a mess.

525
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:16,950
If I go, I'll get sicker.

526
00:39:18,010 --> 00:39:19,930
I didn't know it,

527
00:39:20,490 --> 00:39:24,940
but they said the house will be taken away because  the mortgage loan didn't get paid back.

528
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:31,660
Just to let me do rhythmic gymnastics, all of my family were excessively dragged by me.

529
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:35,480
That's such a burden for me.

530
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:38,780
Because of being dragged

531
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:41,910
our family hurt too much.

532
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:47,030
If I had known that we'd all be hurting together like this, I wouldn't have even started.

533
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:51,900
I was too young then

534
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:55,290
and I can't even stop now.

535
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:59,050
I've come too far to do that.

536
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:12,500
♬  Me too me too me too me too.
If you want a baby...  ♬

537
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:15,900
♬    I love you  ♬

538
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:20,590
Ah! Is he coming or not?!

539
00:40:21,110 --> 00:40:23,040
Ah, seriously!

540
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:36,410
I think I need to keep being sick.

541
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,890
It's really nice that you're treating me so well.

542
00:40:39,890 --> 00:40:43,360
Excuse me. You can make it back by yourself now, right? I've got plans.

543
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,040
Can't you stay with me just a little while longer?

544
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:47,320
I've got to go. I'm late.

545
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:52,950
Make sure you take your medicine.

546
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:03,450
This little bastard. You dare to stand me up? You think I came here because I have so much free time?

547
00:41:03,450 --> 00:41:07,520
Ah, this f**k bastard!  Really, what an a**ole case! Do you think I'm your friend?

548
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:10,500
I'm not your ***! I'm really dumbfounded!

549
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,650
Hey, you. You really get ground down and gulped down.

550
00:41:12,650 --> 00:41:15,990
You sound like a cow chewing gum! What? You said you'd treat me a full course?

551
00:41:15,990 --> 00:41:20,180
You're dead now. DIE!!!

552
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:24,810
Ah, really!! Seriously you bastard! T3. Okay.

553
00:41:24,810 --> 00:41:27,160
 The customer is not currently available. 

554
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:31,140
Ah, why isn't she answering the phone?

555
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:34,230
Did she just go in by herself after waiting for so long?

556
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:37,390
Ah, I'm going to get killed by her now.

557
00:41:37,390 --> 00:41:39,980
Die, die! Die! DIE!!!

558
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:42,970
Die, die! Die, die, die!

559
00:41:42,970 --> 00:41:46,590
Die, die, die, die, die! Get out here. Die!

560
00:41:46,590 --> 00:41:51,140
All of you! Die, die, die! Die!

561
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:53,230
Get shot! Get shot!

562
00:41:53,230 --> 00:41:57,290
Hey, hey! Hey, die! Die!

563
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:01,220
The movie's already over. Why'd you come?

564
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:03,500
Sorry. Sorry. I'm sorry.

565
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:05,810
Don't get in the way of my game.

566
00:42:05,810 --> 00:42:08,150
- I'm sorry.
 - Alright, it's game over now.

567
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:09,930
- I'm sorry.
- You've got to die. Die.

568
00:42:09,930 --> 00:42:13,560
Hey, I'm sorry! I really deserve to die!

569
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:19,260
The guy who deserves to die won't even give me a reason! This thing! I should just—

570
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:23,560
Yeah, that's right! Just hit me instead! Hit me, hit me! Hit me!

571
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:26,820
This is my first time being stood up by a man in my life.

572
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:30,000
I think this is your first time even going to see a movie with a man. Ow!

573
00:42:31,490 --> 00:42:35,240
Hey, hey! You hit me, so that means you're not mad anymore! I'll buy you something delicious in exchange.

574
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:37,920
What about that meat that you like! Meat! Meat!

575
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:40,550
Of course, you should buy it for me. Were you planning on just leaving then?!

576
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:43,060
Okay! Let's hurry up and go, Fatty!

577
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:46,590
You're not buying me pork today. Buy me beef! Beef.

578
00:42:46,590 --> 00:42:50,920
Oh, beef? Oh, well I just won't eat then.

579
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:56,090
♬   I keep thinking of you and missing you    ♬

580
00:42:56,090 --> 00:42:59,500
Wow, I know you said that you were going to eat meat, but aren't you eating too much?

581
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:02,860
I didn't eat that much! Fish cakes don't even amount to that much.

582
00:43:04,990 --> 00:43:07,260
Hey, hey! You'll get hurt.

583
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:11,050
- Here.
 - Oh, thank you.

584
00:43:11,050 --> 00:43:13,420
Aigoo. Aigoo, aigoo.

585
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:16,970
Aigoo, your boyfriend is so attentive! That must be nice.

586
00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:19,430
- He's not my boyfriend.
 - Then your husband?

587
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:21,920
You got married early! You look so young.

588
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:24,950
- He's not.
 - That's not it.

589
00:43:24,950 --> 00:43:26,480
Hey, do you want to eat some more?

590
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:28,680
Yeah. I want this one.

591
00:43:29,470 --> 00:43:34,630
Alright, eat a lot. If you fill up with this, it'll be good for me to spend  less money on beef.

592
00:43:34,630 --> 00:43:36,720
- Aunt, how much is this?
 - Hey, wait! Wait!

593
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:41,430
Aunt, give a stick fishcake. After eating this, I'll eat that.

594
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:50,730
How could you eat four servings of beef after you ate all the fishcakes over there?

595
00:43:50,730 --> 00:43:52,870
Even if  I do so, I can't get a top rank for eating in my department.

596
00:43:52,870 --> 00:43:54,870
Wow, that's awesome. Seriously.

597
00:43:54,870 --> 00:43:59,720
Either way, I enjoyed the food today, Jeong Joon Hyeong. My stress is all gone thanks to you.

598
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:02,990
Okay. Make sure you take a digestive before you go to bed tonight.

599
00:44:02,990 --> 00:44:05,470
On the way, I have already digested it all.

600
00:44:05,470 --> 00:44:10,560
You spent a lot of money today! Of course, you did commit a sin today!

601
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:14,630
That's right, I committed a crime deserving of death. I did.

602
00:44:14,630 --> 00:44:17,300
Oh, look. Are you being sarcastic right now?

603
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:21,030
This thing can't get a hold of himself!

604
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:26,760
Hey, you're far way from coming to your senses.

605
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:29,700
Ah, hey, hey! Wait a second, let me go.

606
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:32,050
This thing, seriously!

607
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:46,730
 All pictures will be deleted. 

608
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:34,720
Knees.

609
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:39,150
Alright.

610
00:45:39,150 --> 00:45:42,110
- Madame, you're here.
 - Madame, it's been so long.

611
00:45:42,110 --> 00:45:44,380
- I was just so busy.
 - Mom,

612
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:45,690
what brings you here without calling beforehand?

613
00:45:45,690 --> 00:45:47,930
I just packed some stir-fried glass noodles and some other things

614
00:45:47,930 --> 00:45:50,000
for you to eat together.

615
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,630
I guess this is the doctor's birthday food.

616
00:45:51,630 --> 00:45:53,450
We'll eat well, Madame.

617
00:45:53,450 --> 00:45:56,360
You must have been busy so why did you bother with this? I was planning to buy dinner anyway.

618
00:45:56,360 --> 00:46:00,510
Dinner is dinner, and this is my heart.

619
00:46:00,510 --> 00:46:03,040
Hey, Jae Yi.

620
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:07,830
Take this to your friend, Ah Yeong.

621
00:46:07,830 --> 00:46:12,690
- What? 
 - You said that she lived alone. She won't cook proper meals for herself.

622
00:46:12,690 --> 00:46:15,530
I packed some side dishes and other plates,

623
00:46:15,530 --> 00:46:17,840
so take them to her today. If you don't, they'll go bad.

624
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:21,380
Mom, why would you do this? You're really going overboard.

625
00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:25,810
What's overboard? I can pack some food for your friend

626
00:46:25,810 --> 00:46:30,180
and you're supposed to share birthday food like this. This is how you'll live a long life.

627
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:32,890
Is that all it is? Are your intentions innocent?

628
00:46:32,890 --> 00:46:37,340
Then what else has to be there? Do you two have something more going on?

629
00:46:37,340 --> 00:46:41,680
I'm thankful that you're taking care of my friend but please don't expect anything else.

630
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:43,980
I want to see her for a long time.

631
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:48,660
Hey, did anyone say anything? I'm being this good to her so you can see her for a long time.

632
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:51,730
Next time, tell her to come visit our home.

633
00:46:51,730 --> 00:46:56,520
Tell her that I have no one to confide in because I don't have a daughter of my own, alright?

634
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:58,380
I understand.

635
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:08,500
  Haneul Sports University Weightlifting Department 

636
00:47:10,050 --> 00:47:12,610
- You did it!
 - Okay!

637
00:47:12,610 --> 00:47:14,540
Bok Joo, you've succeeded 80%.

638
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:17,790
Will 90% be possible right now? Maybe you should take a break.

639
00:47:17,790 --> 00:47:19,580
No, I can do it.

640
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:21,050
Kim Bok Joo, great job!

641
00:47:21,050 --> 00:47:24,480
I think you'll create a new record.

642
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:29,980
Now, let's go.

643
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:32,370
- Good luck!
 - Bok Joo, good luck!

644
00:47:33,050 --> 00:47:37,250
When you lift, put the strength in the stomach and waist and watch out for the front feet.

645
00:47:48,630 --> 00:47:51,470
- Are you okay?
 - Hey, what's wrong? Is it your waist?

646
00:47:52,790 --> 00:47:54,940
I think my muscles were just startled. I'm fine.

647
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:59,320
You don't look fine. Go to the infirmary right now. If you just endure, the pain will get worse and you'll suffer more.

648
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:00,820
Coach Choi, call the infirmary.

649
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:01,670
Yes, I understand.

650
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:03,700
Massage her back for her.

651
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:06,030
Are you okay?

652
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:09,080
Ahh, pain.

653
00:48:13,210 --> 00:48:15,020
Hey, Fatty!

654
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:19,820
Hey, Fatty!

655
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:23,280
Where are you going?

656
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:27,460
I have to go to the infirmary so continue on your way.

657
00:48:27,460 --> 00:48:31,690
Did you get hurt during training? You should have been more careful.

658
00:48:32,850 --> 00:48:35,250
Where are you going?

659
00:48:35,250 --> 00:48:38,610
To give my older brother's—  Just up front.

660
00:48:38,610 --> 00:48:41,110
Yeah, go on then.

661
00:48:41,110 --> 00:48:43,730
Hey, get a proper heat massage!

662
00:48:43,730 --> 00:48:47,060
If you tell the doctor my name, she'll treat you better!

663
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:52,110
Looking at her behavior, it doesn't seem that bad.

664
00:48:52,110 --> 00:48:55,240
Ah, I almost told her that I was going to give my older brother his birthday present.

665
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:58,260
I have to be careful.

666
00:49:11,540 --> 00:49:16,020
Ugh! I have to put this where it's visible so he can see who gifted it to him.

667
00:49:21,150 --> 00:49:22,890
Okay!

668
00:49:28,990 --> 00:49:30,600
Joon Hyeong, your drink.

669
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:33,050
Ah, thank you.

670
00:49:34,860 --> 00:49:36,770
Is this the director's birthday present? What is it?

671
00:49:36,770 --> 00:49:41,620
A speaker. Isn't the display amazing? I want to brag about this quickly. Did my brother go somewhere?

672
00:49:41,620 --> 00:49:43,810
He went to his friend.

673
00:49:43,810 --> 00:49:46,050
Ah, I think he said he was going to your school.

674
00:49:46,050 --> 00:49:48,270
If he's going to my school, then it would be to meet Doctor Ah Yeong—

675
00:49:51,450 --> 00:49:54,030
Hey, my mom packed some food for you because she heard that you live alone.

676
00:49:54,030 --> 00:49:55,710
Are you sure I can accept it?

677
00:49:55,710 --> 00:49:59,040
Am I going to have to listen to another hour of your lecture after I accept that?

678
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:02,410
Hey, I won't do that anymore. I've reflected.

679
00:50:02,410 --> 00:50:07,060
I think you won some points with my mom that night.

680
00:50:07,060 --> 00:50:12,070
Hey, I can't leave right now. I have a student who just sprained her back.

681
00:50:12,070 --> 00:50:15,090
Oh, then I guess I'll just have to deliver it to you.

682
00:50:17,710 --> 00:50:21,190
  The person you are trying to reach is not available at the moment-- 

683
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:25,260
Bok Joo, Bok Joo, Bok Joo...

684
00:50:27,690 --> 00:50:31,110
If you're here, just park and come up. Yeah.

685
00:50:33,290 --> 00:50:37,640
Let's just leave this on here for another 20 minutes. Thankfully, I don't think this is serious enough to prescribe painkillers.

686
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:39,410
Yes.

687
00:50:42,690 --> 00:50:45,850
Bok Joo, please pick up! You don't have time!

688
00:50:52,970 --> 00:50:55,870
Ah, Joon Hyeong.

689
00:50:55,870 --> 00:50:58,350
Hey, hey, hey! Go to the infirmary right now and take Fatty out of there.

690
00:50:58,350 --> 00:51:03,060
Hey, you can NEVER let her meet with my brother. You have to take her out of there, understand?!

691
00:51:05,090 --> 00:51:07,240
- Tae Gwon—
 - Hey—

692
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:09,960
It's great that we met, it's awesome. We have an emergency situation right now, code red.

693
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:14,120
The two of you need to go to the parking lot right now, hold onto the grey-colored SUV just coming in,

694
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:16,210
and drag some time. Do whatever it takes to drag some time,

695
00:51:16,210 --> 00:51:18,400
because that car belongs to Joon Hyeong's older brother.

696
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:22,020
And if he goes to the infirmary right now, he'll run right into Bok Joo. That's what Joon Hyeong said!

697
00:51:22,020 --> 00:51:23,770
- Oh my god!
 - Hey, then...

698
00:51:23,770 --> 00:51:24,690
I know what he looks like, let's go!

699
00:51:24,690 --> 00:51:26,220
Yeah, yeah.

700
00:51:26,220 --> 00:51:29,320
What is this, seriously?! I thought their love already ended!

701
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:32,870
We have to prevent her from being discovered first! Come on, run!

702
00:51:34,450 --> 00:51:36,620
- It's that car!
 - Hey, let's go! Come on!

703
00:51:36,620 --> 00:51:38,470
Stop it!

704
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:41,220
- Stop it! 
 - Hey!
