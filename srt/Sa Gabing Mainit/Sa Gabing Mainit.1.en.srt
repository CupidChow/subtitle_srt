1
00:02:49,664 --> 00:02:50,837
Excuse me.

2
00:02:50,999 --> 00:02:52,564
We’re already checked in.

3
00:02:52,681 --> 00:02:53,729
That’s enough.

4
00:02:57,776 --> 00:02:58,814
[sighs]

5
00:03:04,699 --> 00:03:05,700
I haven’t finished.

6
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:07,399
Idiot.

7
00:03:07,424 --> 00:03:08,626
This isn't serious.

8
00:03:08,993 --> 00:03:10,552
Don’t get too affected.

9
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,680
Let’s go.

10
00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:14,799
[murmuring]

11
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:25,038
Wow! It’s beautiful here.

12
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:27,186
- Right?
- It’s beautiful.

13
00:03:29,131 --> 00:03:30,287
Wow!

14
00:03:47,115 --> 00:03:48,366
What if we don’t go?

15
00:03:50,704 --> 00:03:53,345
You just saw some couples,
now you want to back off?

16
00:03:54,217 --> 00:03:55,636
We’re here already.

17
00:03:56,257 --> 00:03:58,504
Treat it as if it is fate.

18
00:03:59,112 --> 00:04:01,158
F-A-I-T-H?

19
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:06,890
F-A-T-E, so she would know
if she’s already moved on.

20
00:04:07,843 --> 00:04:10,262
You forced us to
be here with you.

21
00:04:10,287 --> 00:04:11,621
Then now, you want to back out?

22
00:04:13,703 --> 00:04:14,806
Let’s go.

23
00:04:15,028 --> 00:04:16,846
No turning back. Let’s go.

24
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,526
Keep going. Go.
You can do this.

25
00:04:27,381 --> 00:04:30,295
Wow! It’s beautiful here.

26
00:04:31,003 --> 00:04:34,843
Wow! It’s so picture perfect here.

27
00:04:35,763 --> 00:04:36,885
Amazing!

28
00:04:38,072 --> 00:04:40,044
This is it.

29
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:42,456
Look! The view is stunning.

30
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:45,060
Right? It’s beautiful.

31
00:04:50,842 --> 00:04:52,220
I’ll just place your things here.

32
00:04:52,245 --> 00:04:56,319
And of course, the staff
are also gorgeous.

33
00:04:56,344 --> 00:04:59,369
I have noticed that you
are all handsome here.

34
00:04:59,394 --> 00:05:00,399
Thank you, ma’am.

35
00:05:00,424 --> 00:05:02,385
Are you included with the freebies?

36
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:04,504
Don’t scare him.

37
00:05:04,529 --> 00:05:05,947
It’s fun to scare him.

38
00:05:06,678 --> 00:05:07,678
Ma'am.

39
00:05:08,081 --> 00:05:09,081
Oh!

40
00:05:09,855 --> 00:05:12,668
Ma’am, we’re not allowed
to fraternize with the guests.

41
00:05:12,701 --> 00:05:13,722
I’m sorry.

42
00:05:13,747 --> 00:05:16,030
Then maybe later after your work.

43
00:05:16,365 --> 00:05:19,368
Ma’am, I’m so sorry.
We’re really not allowed.

44
00:05:19,914 --> 00:05:22,926
That’s okay, she’s right.

45
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,112
- We’re really not allowed.
- Can I have a look?

46
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:28,930
Come on, I’ll be gentle, I promise.

47
00:05:28,955 --> 00:05:30,415
I might get fired.

48
00:05:35,847 --> 00:05:37,677
I’ve seen this before.

49
00:05:39,834 --> 00:05:41,002
Yeah, we have.

50
00:05:41,115 --> 00:05:42,191
This is an old story.

51
00:05:42,756 --> 00:05:44,661
Is there no plot twist?

52
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:47,080
Isn’t there a happy ending?

53
00:05:51,192 --> 00:05:52,210
None.

54
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:56,089
We’ve broken up.

55
00:05:58,487 --> 00:06:00,635
This time, it’s for good.

56
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:02,574
Period.

57
00:06:02,599 --> 00:06:03,733
Really?

58
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:05,577
Why don’t you believe me?

59
00:06:06,754 --> 00:06:08,601
How many times
has that happened, Tony?

60
00:06:09,482 --> 00:06:10,929
One, two, three?

61
00:06:10,983 --> 00:06:12,360
It’s not enough.

62
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,647
Even if I count with your fingers.

63
00:06:15,423 --> 00:06:16,590
You’re both annoying.

64
00:06:17,265 --> 00:06:19,644
Oh come on, tell us the story.

65
00:06:20,286 --> 00:06:21,958
You know what it is.

66
00:06:22,558 --> 00:06:24,034
We’ll listen.

67
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:26,578
Oh, snob.

68
00:06:27,936 --> 00:06:29,039
Oh, dear...

69
00:06:30,034 --> 00:06:34,502
It’s not over until it’s really over.

70
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:35,712
Let her be.

71
00:07:40,779 --> 00:07:45,323
I really don’t like it when I’m about to
climax then my partner starts to hit me.

72
00:07:47,244 --> 00:07:49,569
He starts to get angry
whenever I try to stop him.

73
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:55,779
He becomes more violent
when I try to stop him.

74
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:58,061
He’s left hanging.

75
00:08:00,047 --> 00:08:01,236
Actually,

76
00:08:01,891 --> 00:08:03,175
he’s okay.

77
00:08:03,996 --> 00:08:05,032
Sweet.

78
00:08:06,312 --> 00:08:07,429
Caring.

79
00:08:08,566 --> 00:08:11,569
But when it comes to sex,
he’s different.

80
00:08:13,168 --> 00:08:15,754
I can endure the physical pain.

81
00:08:17,171 --> 00:08:18,611
That’s all in the mind.

82
00:08:22,473 --> 00:08:24,237
I endured it for three years.

83
00:08:24,718 --> 00:08:28,825
Because I thought he’s my forever.

84
00:08:30,346 --> 00:08:34,289
But I can’t withstand
the pain here in my heart.

85
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:42,480
The pain in my heart that cuts me deeply.

86
00:08:43,786 --> 00:08:45,925
In the hidden camera that I have set up,

87
00:08:47,266 --> 00:08:50,478
I caught him having an
affair with another woman.

88
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:53,700
He’s so in to it.

89
00:08:54,761 --> 00:08:58,146
It was like he was going
crazy for the other woman.

90
00:08:59,222 --> 00:09:00,807
In our bed.

91
00:09:01,809 --> 00:09:04,561
Then when he took off the girl’s clothes,

92
00:09:05,259 --> 00:09:09,104
I saw the bra and
panties that I bought.

93
00:09:09,584 --> 00:09:10,753
It really hurt.

94
00:09:12,777 --> 00:09:13,789
It hurts.

95
00:09:14,573 --> 00:09:15,866
That’s mine.

96
00:09:16,513 --> 00:09:18,421
That damn woman.

97
00:09:18,868 --> 00:09:22,879
Can she not afford to buy
expensive bra and panties?

98
00:09:24,169 --> 00:09:26,583
What is it called again?

99
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:28,110
Ah, lingerie.

100
00:09:29,311 --> 00:09:30,550
Yes, that’s expensive.

101
00:09:30,988 --> 00:09:32,847
I bought it when I got my salary.

102
00:09:35,384 --> 00:09:37,010
And it’s also priceless,

103
00:09:38,773 --> 00:09:45,083
because that’s my effort
for the one that I love.

104
00:09:46,497 --> 00:09:49,394
I wanted him to have the best
for our third year anniversary.

105
00:09:49,901 --> 00:09:51,554
The girl is pretty.

106
00:09:54,102 --> 00:09:56,100
Yeah, that’s right, she’s pretty.

107
00:09:56,420 --> 00:10:00,134
I think my expensive lingerie suits her.

108
00:10:00,665 --> 00:10:01,713
Right?

109
00:10:03,002 --> 00:10:04,002
There...

110
00:10:04,419 --> 00:10:06,939
Are you angry because
she’s more beautiful than you?

111
00:10:08,095 --> 00:10:09,764
Introduce her to me.

112
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:11,426
I’ll take care of her. Promise.

113
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:13,672
I’m still beautiful, right?

114
00:10:13,728 --> 00:10:14,728
Yes!

115
00:10:15,407 --> 00:10:16,407
You’re beautiful.

116
00:10:16,623 --> 00:10:18,033
If you’re not beautiful,

117
00:10:18,725 --> 00:10:22,187
you wouldn’t win the Ms. Swimsuit
competition back in college.

118
00:10:23,091 --> 00:10:24,217
Check, girl!

119
00:10:24,242 --> 00:10:25,382
And you know what?

120
00:10:25,456 --> 00:10:29,293
I had a crush on you
when we were in college.

121
00:10:29,778 --> 00:10:32,951
But it went away when
you fell in love with Jam.

122
00:10:33,853 --> 00:10:36,731
That gigantic footface
was such a playboy.

123
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:38,567
What did you like about him?

124
00:10:38,591 --> 00:10:39,926
You know it.

125
00:10:39,951 --> 00:10:44,196
Giant feet means having...

126
00:10:46,188 --> 00:10:47,625
But I don’t like him anymore.

127
00:10:48,701 --> 00:10:50,119
Let him have his cock to himself.

128
00:10:50,839 --> 00:10:52,173
I can get through this, right?

129
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,259
Of course you can!

130
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:57,057
Tell yourself that you can.

131
00:10:57,435 --> 00:11:00,936
Because if you give him another chance,

132
00:11:01,346 --> 00:11:03,454
he'll just cheat on you again.

133
00:11:03,945 --> 00:11:05,947
There are many men in the world.

134
00:11:06,361 --> 00:11:07,361
Kind.

135
00:11:07,819 --> 00:11:08,820
Serious.

136
00:11:09,618 --> 00:11:11,497
Will treat you right.

137
00:11:12,506 --> 00:11:14,609
And with even bigger feet than Jam.

138
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,584
You know what?

139
00:11:16,896 --> 00:11:21,234
What if I’ll introduce you to the guy
that I had a one night stand with?

140
00:11:21,498 --> 00:11:23,000
Bitch! He’s big.

141
00:11:23,678 --> 00:11:25,086
American-sized.

142
00:11:25,111 --> 00:11:28,114
Like a jumbo hotdog, but Filipino.

143
00:11:28,866 --> 00:11:30,276
You want us to share?

144
00:11:30,787 --> 00:11:32,372
No way.

145
00:11:32,498 --> 00:11:33,978
Why don’t you try using a dating app?

146
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:37,898
Yes, why don’t you try it?

147
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:39,105
Actually,

148
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:40,548
I have lots of friends

149
00:11:40,573 --> 00:11:43,461
that met their partners
through dating apps.

150
00:11:43,903 --> 00:11:47,611
And most of them have decent partners.

151
00:11:47,823 --> 00:11:49,075
Why don’t you try it?

152
00:11:49,412 --> 00:11:51,080
So let’s put an end to it.

153
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,463
Exclamation point!

154
00:11:53,935 --> 00:11:54,935
Dot.

155
00:11:55,079 --> 00:11:56,497
Period.

156
00:11:56,995 --> 00:11:58,038
True!

157
00:11:58,172 --> 00:12:01,549
Thank God you’ve realized your worth.

158
00:12:04,909 --> 00:12:06,111
Come on, give us a hug!

159
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:10,690
Love you, girl!

160
00:12:11,794 --> 00:12:13,338
We’re always here for you.

161
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:18,945
Phew!

162
00:12:19,602 --> 00:12:21,924
Wow! This camp is big!

163
00:12:23,121 --> 00:12:24,121
Alright.

164
00:12:24,405 --> 00:12:27,175
So, is there a chapel here?

165
00:12:27,668 --> 00:12:30,027
What the heck? What chapel?

166
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:31,690
It’s the weekend.

167
00:12:31,715 --> 00:12:34,244
We need to go to church.

168
00:12:35,252 --> 00:12:36,808
I think there is.

169
00:12:37,183 --> 00:12:38,353
I’m not sure.

170
00:12:38,711 --> 00:12:40,431
On our last day
before we go home,

171
00:12:40,456 --> 00:12:42,815
- let’s look for a church in the city.
- Nice!

172
00:12:42,902 --> 00:12:46,099
We might have
brought too much beer.

173
00:12:46,124 --> 00:12:47,970
- It’s heavy.
- That’s okay.

174
00:12:48,137 --> 00:12:50,263
So we could have a happy birthday weekend.

175
00:12:52,517 --> 00:12:57,663
- Happy birthday to you!
- Happy birthday to you!

176
00:12:57,688 --> 00:13:00,107
Nica, I think it’s your opportunity.

177
00:13:00,132 --> 00:13:03,901
- Happy birthday to you!
- Happy birthday to you!

178
00:13:03,986 --> 00:13:06,948
Happy birthday to you.

179
00:13:08,054 --> 00:13:09,564
You see those three girls?

180
00:13:10,573 --> 00:13:13,127
I like the one wearing a gym sando.

181
00:13:13,968 --> 00:13:16,471
I like the one with the cap.

182
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:18,171
He looks fresh.

183
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:20,186
They’ve been staring at us.

184
00:13:21,022 --> 00:13:23,047
Let’s go talk to them?

185
00:13:23,946 --> 00:13:26,080
- Game!
- Game!

186
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:29,501
Act cool.

187
00:13:30,972 --> 00:13:32,170
Good evening, ladies.

188
00:13:33,211 --> 00:13:35,993
Hi. Hello, I'm Tony.

189
00:13:36,018 --> 00:13:37,177
Tony, nice to meet you.

190
00:13:37,348 --> 00:13:40,813
And these are my friends, Nica, Ellen.

191
00:13:42,108 --> 00:13:43,108
Hello.

192
00:13:43,849 --> 00:13:45,586
This is Pancho.

193
00:13:45,955 --> 00:13:47,650
- Hello.
- Tacks.

194
00:13:48,281 --> 00:13:49,282
I'm Ralph.

195
00:13:50,283 --> 00:13:52,690
I think it would be better
if we stay as a group?

196
00:13:53,395 --> 00:13:54,395
Is that okay with you?

197
00:13:56,247 --> 00:13:57,408
I don't think so.

198
00:13:59,876 --> 00:14:00,876
Okay.

199
00:14:01,483 --> 00:14:02,912
Don’t be such a puss.

200
00:14:03,787 --> 00:14:05,789
Let her be. She’s
just not in the mood.

201
00:14:07,024 --> 00:14:08,897
We’re from Manila.

202
00:14:09,184 --> 00:14:12,104
We’re here to celebrate Ralph’s birthday.

203
00:14:12,622 --> 00:14:13,622
Really?

204
00:14:14,365 --> 00:14:16,159
- Happy birthday!
- Happy birthday!

205
00:14:16,184 --> 00:14:17,184
Thank you, ladies.

206
00:14:17,851 --> 00:14:19,426
Wow, birthday kiss.

207
00:14:20,045 --> 00:14:21,045
Uh...

208
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:22,508
Happy birthday.

209
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:23,774
How about a birthday kiss?

210
00:14:25,578 --> 00:14:28,387
Oh, it’s a no.

211
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,740
This isn't going well for me.

212
00:14:31,632 --> 00:14:32,842
We’re from QC.

213
00:14:32,867 --> 00:14:35,328
We just went with our friend

214
00:14:35,353 --> 00:14:36,771
because she’s heartbroken.

215
00:14:37,017 --> 00:14:39,348
- Yeah.
- Oh, maybe I can help.

216
00:14:39,542 --> 00:14:40,823
I’m a doctor by profession.

217
00:14:40,891 --> 00:14:41,891
Wow!

218
00:14:42,411 --> 00:14:45,837
Doc, can you assist my friend?

219
00:14:45,985 --> 00:14:48,288
She might have a heart
attack because of you.

220
00:14:48,313 --> 00:14:49,666
Really? Seriously?

221
00:14:50,011 --> 00:14:51,364
Don't be too dramatic, sis.

222
00:14:52,053 --> 00:14:53,237
Why? Isn’t it true?

223
00:14:53,262 --> 00:14:56,045
Hey, you know,
I just want to forget.

224
00:14:56,409 --> 00:14:58,828
Here, let’s drink so you could forget.

225
00:14:59,167 --> 00:15:00,425
Drum roll...

226
00:15:03,065 --> 00:15:05,214
Wow, you're not prepared, huh?

227
00:15:05,733 --> 00:15:10,488
We know you’re here, that’s
why we brought plenty for you.

228
00:15:11,681 --> 00:15:12,724
Instantly?

229
00:15:14,467 --> 00:15:16,260
We’re a friendly bunch.

230
00:15:16,285 --> 00:15:17,344
And kind.

231
00:15:19,465 --> 00:15:21,681
I dare you to kiss me if
you really are friendly.

232
00:15:22,248 --> 00:15:23,248
Go on.

233
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:26,498
- Go ahead.
- Instantly, sis?

234
00:15:26,567 --> 00:15:29,570
Sorry if you’re shocked, sis.

235
00:15:29,702 --> 00:15:32,145
Sorry if I was too upfront.

236
00:15:32,378 --> 00:15:33,934
Or you don’t really want to?

237
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:37,837
If you want, I’ll just kiss you.

238
00:15:38,991 --> 00:15:40,727
Kiss!

239
00:15:40,935 --> 00:15:41,978
Kiss!

240
00:15:42,003 --> 00:15:43,629
- Kiss.
- Here.

241
00:15:46,082 --> 00:15:47,667
Tacks is still young.

242
00:15:47,692 --> 00:15:48,734
Uncircumcised.

243
00:15:50,224 --> 00:15:51,233
Joke.

244
00:15:51,988 --> 00:15:53,656
He’s just boyish.

245
00:15:54,206 --> 00:15:55,271
He has a gift wrap?

246
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:58,718
Never been kissed, never been touched.

247
00:16:00,015 --> 00:16:01,015
Is that true?

248
00:16:02,231 --> 00:16:03,462
- Virgin?
- Virgin?

249
00:16:04,548 --> 00:16:05,841
Stop it, you two.

250
00:16:06,711 --> 00:16:08,143
You’re making me shy.

251
00:16:08,637 --> 00:16:11,271
Don’t worry, I’m also the shy type.

252
00:16:12,153 --> 00:16:13,279
We’re meant to be.

253
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,323
I’m a loyal person.

254
00:16:22,838 --> 00:16:24,136
I don’t like being two-timed.

255
00:16:25,282 --> 00:16:26,367
What’s two-timed?

256
00:16:27,034 --> 00:16:30,955
Two timer, three timer. Everyone at once.

257
00:16:31,953 --> 00:16:36,121
Because I feel that I can never
do that to the person I love.

258
00:16:39,255 --> 00:16:40,255
Here...

259
00:16:40,793 --> 00:16:41,989
To be honest,

260
00:16:42,496 --> 00:16:44,403
I haven’t had a girlfriend before.

261
00:16:45,133 --> 00:16:46,201
For real.

262
00:16:46,417 --> 00:16:49,283
But I think if I get to have one,

263
00:16:49,932 --> 00:16:51,016
I’ll also be loyal.

264
00:16:51,419 --> 00:16:53,379
Because I don’t know
how to do those things.

265
00:16:56,485 --> 00:16:58,602
I’m lucky with my baby.

266
00:16:59,367 --> 00:17:00,928
Can I kiss you again, baby?

267
00:17:05,995 --> 00:17:07,025
Me too.

268
00:17:07,302 --> 00:17:08,942
My heart has been broken since last year.

269
00:17:09,645 --> 00:17:10,771
Because?

270
00:17:10,858 --> 00:17:12,568
Tell the truth!

271
00:17:12,593 --> 00:17:13,986
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

272
00:17:14,654 --> 00:17:15,654
I cheated,

273
00:17:16,475 --> 00:17:18,047
I had two girlfriends.

274
00:17:18,299 --> 00:17:20,272
She caught me with another girl.

275
00:17:21,218 --> 00:17:22,470
She didn't even confront me.

276
00:17:22,495 --> 00:17:25,352
She just sent the video of me
going into a hotel with the other girl.

277
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,352
Even if she loved me,

278
00:17:29,377 --> 00:17:30,521
she broke up with me.

279
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:33,058
I get that it’s my fault, but...

280
00:17:34,423 --> 00:17:35,621
I learned my lesson.

281
00:17:37,811 --> 00:17:39,187
I won’t be a two-timer anymore.

282
00:17:43,537 --> 00:17:47,249
My ex works overseas.

283
00:17:48,811 --> 00:17:50,924
Then, I just heard

284
00:17:52,179 --> 00:17:54,682
the reason that she’s not
talking to me anymore...

285
00:17:56,292 --> 00:17:57,898
She already has a foreigner boyfriend.

286
00:17:59,687 --> 00:18:01,063
She admitted it.

287
00:18:03,301 --> 00:18:05,345
Maybe that really is how LDR works.

288
00:18:07,501 --> 00:18:08,501
So...

289
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:11,419
It seems like all of us,

290
00:18:12,094 --> 00:18:13,675
one way or another,

291
00:18:15,202 --> 00:18:17,302
have gone through heartbreaks.

292
00:18:18,282 --> 00:18:20,117
But it will pass, right, Nica?

293
00:18:20,977 --> 00:18:22,145
Yes, it will.

294
00:18:23,982 --> 00:18:25,150
Me...

295
00:18:25,844 --> 00:18:27,429
I’ll never be sad.

296
00:18:28,299 --> 00:18:29,551
Because of my baby.

297
00:18:30,822 --> 00:18:31,904
Right, baby?

298
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:36,150
Answer.

299
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,390
Uh...

300
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:40,728
I’m not a baby.

301
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,515
Really, baby?

302
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:43,785
But yes, okay.

303
00:18:45,998 --> 00:18:47,041
Cheers!

304
00:18:58,883 --> 00:18:59,952
Sometimes,

305
00:19:00,602 --> 00:19:03,118
I don’t want to make a
wish to the stars anymore.

306
00:19:03,971 --> 00:19:07,224
With everything I've wished
for, nothing has come true.

307
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:10,241
Maybe it's not for you.

308
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:12,263
Because if it's meant for you,

309
00:19:13,606 --> 00:19:16,025
even if you don't wish for it,

310
00:19:16,807 --> 00:19:17,883
it’ll be yours.

311
00:19:21,671 --> 00:19:23,214
So, you don’t believe?

312
00:19:24,359 --> 00:19:25,443
Before.

313
00:19:25,468 --> 00:19:26,630
I also do that.

314
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:29,183
But as I've matured, it’s like...

315
00:19:30,895 --> 00:19:33,459
It depends with your beliefs and energy.

316
00:19:34,755 --> 00:19:36,133
What do you mean?

317
00:19:39,048 --> 00:19:40,356
Like when I first saw you.

318
00:19:42,517 --> 00:19:44,440
Even if your energy was down.

319
00:19:44,465 --> 00:19:46,743
I somehow felt that...

320
00:19:47,515 --> 00:19:48,933
our energies would match.

321
00:19:50,367 --> 00:19:51,367
You’re not sure.

322
00:19:51,934 --> 00:19:53,369
That’s why it’s just a feeling.

323
00:19:53,604 --> 00:19:55,010
Just a somehow.

324
00:19:58,645 --> 00:20:00,395
I don’t want to fall in love again.

325
00:20:02,391 --> 00:20:03,391
Me too.

326
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:09,189
I haven't had a girlfriend
for about a year now.

327
00:20:11,831 --> 00:20:13,836
Sometimes we need a long break

328
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:15,531
to really realize what we are.

329
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:20,232
To realize where,

330
00:20:20,301 --> 00:20:22,595
or who we're for.

331
00:20:25,055 --> 00:20:27,057
That’s true.
It’s hard to fall in love again.

332
00:20:28,142 --> 00:20:29,230
Yeah,

333
00:20:30,741 --> 00:20:31,951
that's how it goes.

334
00:20:31,976 --> 00:20:33,061
Love is a risk.

335
00:20:34,311 --> 00:20:35,551
As what they say,

336
00:20:36,313 --> 00:20:38,345
there's no happiness without pain.

337
00:20:39,695 --> 00:20:41,891
There's no love

338
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:43,355
without hatred.

339
00:20:50,484 --> 00:20:52,443
Hey, you good?

340
00:20:54,164 --> 00:20:55,364
Try to stop thinking about it.

341
00:20:57,184 --> 00:20:58,324
Have a good sleep.

342
00:20:59,128 --> 00:21:01,493
And tomorrow we’ll have fun.

343
00:21:02,106 --> 00:21:03,262
Let's enjoy the camp.

344
00:21:04,184 --> 00:21:05,212
Have fun.

345
00:21:07,785 --> 00:21:09,190
You have a point.

346
00:21:15,535 --> 00:21:16,551
Well...

347
00:21:18,016 --> 00:21:19,298
I think you should rest.

348
00:21:30,287 --> 00:21:31,539
All right, well.

349
00:21:31,564 --> 00:21:33,404
I’ll go back to the tent,
so you can sleep.

350
00:21:33,898 --> 00:21:34,944
Good night, Nica.

351
00:21:36,225 --> 00:21:37,530
Please stay here.

352
00:21:39,668 --> 00:21:41,079
They’re still outside.

353
00:21:41,408 --> 00:21:42,668
I’m alone.

354
00:21:45,843 --> 00:21:46,861
Okay.

355
00:21:49,317 --> 00:21:51,068
I’ll stay until you fall asleep.

356
00:21:53,407 --> 00:21:54,465
Thank you.

357
00:21:56,436 --> 00:21:57,501
You're welcome.

358
00:22:00,064 --> 00:22:01,523
Happy birthday.

359
00:22:02,399 --> 00:22:03,399
Thanks.

360
00:22:39,955 --> 00:22:42,583
- Why?
- Sorry. I’m not yet ready.

361
00:22:44,425 --> 00:22:45,440
It's okay.

362
00:22:45,859 --> 00:22:46,904
I understand.

363
00:22:48,898 --> 00:22:50,024
Go to sleep.

364
00:22:52,362 --> 00:22:53,410
Good night.

365
00:32:16,933 --> 00:32:18,184
Thank you.

366
00:32:18,908 --> 00:32:20,746
I’ll feed you, come here.

367
00:32:24,132 --> 00:32:25,383
So sweet.

368
00:32:25,563 --> 00:32:26,606
Is that a baby?

369
00:32:27,290 --> 00:32:29,865
That’s what it is when you’re in love.

370
00:32:31,192 --> 00:32:34,185
No one wants to
treat me like a baby.

371
00:32:34,691 --> 00:32:35,776
Really?

372
00:32:35,915 --> 00:32:36,962
Oh...

373
00:32:39,581 --> 00:32:41,374
How yummy!

374
00:32:42,116 --> 00:32:43,116
Wow.

375
00:32:43,665 --> 00:32:45,667
Just like last night,
I really liked it.

376
00:32:46,298 --> 00:32:47,298
Hey!

377
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:49,294
Pancho moves quick.

378
00:32:49,709 --> 00:32:52,086
I rushed it so I can
get to the finish line.

379
00:32:52,192 --> 00:32:53,276
Later again.

380
00:32:53,445 --> 00:32:54,904
What if we do it now?

381
00:32:55,838 --> 00:32:56,949
Are you in a hurry?

382
00:32:57,496 --> 00:32:59,290
Is the baby still a baby?

383
00:33:00,849 --> 00:33:01,850
What do you think?

384
00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:02,970
Still a baby.

385
00:33:03,627 --> 00:33:05,295
That’s right!

386
00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:07,064
Why?

387
00:33:07,647 --> 00:33:08,647
Nothing happened.

388
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,031
Just a hug.

389
00:33:10,631 --> 00:33:12,076
He’s still a baby.

390
00:33:13,115 --> 00:33:15,409
It seems like your
streak has been broken.

391
00:33:15,683 --> 00:33:20,745
I don’t know, I was giving it,
but he wouldn’t take it.

392
00:33:22,102 --> 00:33:23,479
I got drunk.

393
00:33:24,239 --> 00:33:25,949
He went to sleep.

394
00:33:26,708 --> 00:33:27,927
Sorry!

395
00:33:28,336 --> 00:33:29,395
Don’t worry.

396
00:33:29,694 --> 00:33:32,747
I’ll make it up to you later.

397
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:36,759
It’s okay, baby.

398
00:33:37,271 --> 00:33:39,094
I’m not in a hurry.

399
00:33:39,126 --> 00:33:40,126
Wow.

400
00:33:41,698 --> 00:33:43,521
How about the birthday boy?

401
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:45,572
Did he also got lucky last night?

402
00:33:47,591 --> 00:33:50,761
Nothing get past Ralph.

403
00:33:51,026 --> 00:33:52,693
That’s right!

404
00:33:53,319 --> 00:33:54,528
Nothing happened.

405
00:33:54,868 --> 00:33:56,476
He’s a gentleman.

406
00:33:57,989 --> 00:33:59,115
Really?

407
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:00,558
He’s preparing for you?

408
00:34:01,551 --> 00:34:03,303
- No.
- That’s for later.

409
00:34:03,328 --> 00:34:04,432
I’m not yet ready.

410
00:34:07,916 --> 00:34:09,542
Wow, virgin-like?

411
00:34:10,990 --> 00:34:11,990
Again?

412
00:34:13,185 --> 00:34:15,078
Guys, it’s okay.

413
00:34:15,393 --> 00:34:16,473
We just slept.

414
00:35:42,835 --> 00:35:44,529
[chattering]

415
00:35:44,554 --> 00:35:46,118
What a beautiful morning.

416
00:35:46,584 --> 00:35:48,211
Very sexy.

417
00:35:48,258 --> 00:35:49,547
Delicious.

418
00:35:50,609 --> 00:35:54,048
- Miss, can we join you?
- Let us join!

419
00:35:55,023 --> 00:35:56,900
Hi, miss. Can we?

420
00:35:57,192 --> 00:35:58,936
Hey sir, is there a problem?

421
00:35:59,061 --> 00:36:00,962
- Do you have a problem?
- What?

422
00:36:01,922 --> 00:36:02,954
What's going on?

423
00:36:02,979 --> 00:36:04,813
Don’t be like that.
You’re being rude.

424
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:08,114
You wanna see what
you’re looking for?

425
00:36:08,693 --> 00:36:09,693
What?

426
00:36:10,182 --> 00:36:11,898
Looks like they want a fight, bro.

427
00:36:12,201 --> 00:36:13,201
What?

428
00:36:13,601 --> 00:36:15,144
Boys, boys, boys.

429
00:36:15,585 --> 00:36:16,878
The morning is beautiful.

430
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:18,588
Are we going to ruin it?

431
00:36:19,214 --> 00:36:20,214
Just let it go.

432
00:36:20,965 --> 00:36:23,802
Please don’t be like that.

433
00:36:24,747 --> 00:36:25,845
That’s harassment.

434
00:36:27,967 --> 00:36:29,011
We’re sorry.

435
00:36:29,036 --> 00:36:30,896
We’re just appreciating them.

436
00:36:31,716 --> 00:36:32,769
Again, sorry.

437
00:36:33,050 --> 00:36:34,984
It’s okay.Good morning.

438
00:36:35,701 --> 00:36:37,202
Don’t let this happen again.

439
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,513
Sorry.

440
00:36:40,651 --> 00:36:42,591
My baby is so good.

441
00:36:43,992 --> 00:36:45,155
They’re right.

442
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:48,218
Fighting never solves any problem.

443
00:36:48,852 --> 00:36:50,603
We should’ve fought them.

444
00:36:50,628 --> 00:36:51,908
What did you say earlier, Tacks?

445
00:36:51,933 --> 00:36:53,202
They will see what they are looking for.

446
00:36:53,227 --> 00:36:55,312
Chill. Chill. Relax.

447
00:36:57,841 --> 00:37:00,635
- How are you, ladies?
- We’re good.

448
00:38:40,729 --> 00:38:42,814
Take a picture of me here.

449
00:38:43,636 --> 00:38:44,908
Sure. Where’s your phone?

450
00:38:55,438 --> 00:38:56,629
Game, game game.

451
00:38:56,708 --> 00:38:57,708
Do a pose.

452
00:38:59,355 --> 00:39:00,523
The lighting is good.

453
00:39:01,234 --> 00:39:02,309
There. Smile.

454
00:39:04,181 --> 00:39:05,569
More, more, more.
There you go.

455
00:39:10,368 --> 00:39:11,452
There you go.

456
00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:14,225
Beautiful.

457
00:39:14,994 --> 00:39:15,994
Nice.

458
00:39:22,043 --> 00:39:23,341
Is the phone damaged?

459
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:26,016
Are the shots ugly?

460
00:39:27,367 --> 00:39:29,969
No, it’s beautiful.

461
00:39:30,427 --> 00:39:31,428
Take a look.

462
00:39:35,609 --> 00:39:36,652
See.

463
00:39:38,766 --> 00:39:40,095
- Nice!
- You look cute.

464
00:39:40,613 --> 00:39:41,813
But there’s something missing.

465
00:39:42,342 --> 00:39:43,362
Missing?

466
00:39:44,923 --> 00:39:45,954
What’s missing?

467
00:39:46,515 --> 00:39:47,515
Us.

468
00:39:48,434 --> 00:39:49,434
What us?

469
00:39:50,461 --> 00:39:51,766
Shots of us.

470
00:39:52,124 --> 00:39:53,124
Hello.

471
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:55,935
Yeah... Let’s take a selfie.

472
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:56,961
Sure.

473
00:40:12,867 --> 00:40:14,734
Give it to me.
Let’s take it from here.

474
00:40:38,673 --> 00:40:39,716
Why?

475
00:40:41,477 --> 00:40:45,396
Why do you always ask why
whenever I kiss you?

476
00:40:46,479 --> 00:40:47,688
Why did you kiss me?

477
00:40:50,947 --> 00:40:52,991
Because you made me happy today.

478
00:40:56,588 --> 00:40:57,665
You're welcome.

479
00:40:58,538 --> 00:41:00,581
And it’s also your birthday.

480
00:41:01,822 --> 00:41:03,032
Thank you.

481
00:41:03,795 --> 00:41:05,171
But I don’t have a gift.

482
00:41:06,928 --> 00:41:08,704
That’s okay. No problem.

483
00:41:09,092 --> 00:41:11,095
Being with you is already enough.

484
00:41:12,024 --> 00:41:13,693
Such a smooth talker.

485
00:41:13,718 --> 00:41:14,719
That’s not true.

486
00:41:19,156 --> 00:41:20,156
Why?

487
00:41:22,908 --> 00:41:24,452
That’s my birthday gift to you.

488
00:41:25,742 --> 00:41:28,036
I like that birthday gift.

489
00:41:28,252 --> 00:41:30,004
It’s as tasty as the birthday cake.

490
00:41:30,604 --> 00:41:33,858
You like birthday cakes, huh?

491
00:41:36,088 --> 00:41:37,088
That’s not allowed.

492
00:41:41,182 --> 00:41:42,236
Fine.

493
00:41:43,676 --> 00:41:44,718
Joke.

494
00:41:44,745 --> 00:41:46,945
It's okay, I understand,

495
00:41:47,767 --> 00:41:49,074
But sometimes,

496
00:41:50,951 --> 00:41:53,638
it's okay to just be happy.

497
00:41:57,879 --> 00:42:00,715
But... I’m not used to that.

498
00:42:01,748 --> 00:42:02,748
How?

499
00:44:07,529 --> 00:44:08,922
Ah, it's a beautiful day.

500
00:44:09,996 --> 00:44:10,997
You want to go for a swim?

501
00:44:11,082 --> 00:44:12,082
Yes.

502
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:15,000
But I’m hungry.

503
00:44:15,037 --> 00:44:16,037
Or swimming?

504
00:44:18,741 --> 00:44:20,701
Wow. Up to no good here, now?

505
00:44:22,466 --> 00:44:24,217
What I do is none of your business.

506
00:44:25,237 --> 00:44:26,322
So, you have a new one?

507
00:44:27,128 --> 00:44:28,514
You also have someone new.

508
00:44:28,591 --> 00:44:29,926
Did I question you?

509
00:44:29,986 --> 00:44:31,112
Let’s talk, Nica.

510
00:44:31,707 --> 00:44:34,752
We don’t have anything
to talk about. You ended it.

511
00:44:35,017 --> 00:44:36,859
I’ve been calling you.

512
00:44:36,922 --> 00:44:37,922
You’re not answering.

513
00:44:38,594 --> 00:44:39,929
I went to your house.

514
00:44:39,969 --> 00:44:40,969
But you’re not there.

515
00:44:41,453 --> 00:44:44,498
This is the only place you
go to whenever this happens.

516
00:44:45,751 --> 00:44:47,669
Why are you here?

517
00:44:49,024 --> 00:44:50,401
I just want to explain, Nica.

518
00:44:51,082 --> 00:44:52,840
What else are you going to explain?

519
00:44:55,479 --> 00:44:56,479
Let’s go.

520
00:44:57,249 --> 00:44:58,797
- Let’s go home.
- I don't want to!

521
00:44:58,822 --> 00:44:59,960
- We're going home.
- You’re hurting me.

522
00:44:59,984 --> 00:45:01,770
Hey! That's enough.

523
00:45:01,941 --> 00:45:03,110
Back off!

524
00:45:04,127 --> 00:45:05,211
Then stop hurting her.

525
00:45:05,236 --> 00:45:06,236
Who are you?

526
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:08,046
What’s your relationship with Nica?

527
00:45:08,895 --> 00:45:11,383
I’m Nica’s boyfriend.
I'm her new boyfriend.

528
00:45:11,799 --> 00:45:14,302
Wow! You change men fast.

529
00:45:15,727 --> 00:45:16,727
Wait.

530
00:45:17,661 --> 00:45:20,074
I can’t even count how
many girls you have, Jam!

531
00:45:22,002 --> 00:45:23,445
I loved you.

532
00:45:25,006 --> 00:45:27,170
But you loved yourself more.

533
00:45:28,314 --> 00:45:30,219
You’ve hurt me so many times.

534
00:45:32,435 --> 00:45:34,254
I just let it go.

535
00:45:34,611 --> 00:45:35,779
Just to make you happy.

536
00:45:37,996 --> 00:45:40,958
But, what hurts the most is to
see you happy in another’s arms.

537
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:44,065
She even used the
lingerie that I bought.

538
00:45:45,069 --> 00:45:46,487
That’s the worst!

539
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:50,635
I don’t like people using
and abusing my stuff.

540
00:45:50,681 --> 00:45:51,963
You talk too much,

541
00:45:52,808 --> 00:45:54,023
Hey, that’s enough!

542
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:57,320
Stop it!

543
00:46:00,854 --> 00:46:01,939
Leave!

544
00:46:04,152 --> 00:46:06,036
There’s nothing for us to talk about.

545
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:08,468
I’m tired of you!

546
00:46:10,099 --> 00:46:11,713
If you already
have someone else,

547
00:46:12,063 --> 00:46:13,412
I do too.

548
00:46:14,546 --> 00:46:15,964
One that would treat me right.

549
00:46:17,381 --> 00:46:18,461
If you want to fight Ralph,

550
00:46:19,521 --> 00:46:20,981
you’ll need to get through me.

551
00:46:22,729 --> 00:46:23,939
Damn you two!

552
00:46:32,866 --> 00:46:34,034
Screw you!

553
00:46:34,298 --> 00:46:35,298
Asshole.

554
00:46:39,625 --> 00:46:40,625
Are you okay?

555
00:46:41,293 --> 00:46:42,293
Yeah.

556
00:46:45,878 --> 00:46:47,171
[screaming]

557
00:46:51,017 --> 00:46:53,494
Is that your <i>Mi Ultimo Adios?</i>

558
00:46:53,579 --> 00:46:54,579
Yes.

559
00:46:56,923 --> 00:46:58,111
It really is goodbye.

560
00:46:59,632 --> 00:47:00,883
This is the last one.

561
00:47:01,690 --> 00:47:03,745
I will never be fooled again.

562
00:47:05,580 --> 00:47:06,599
I'm happy for you.

563
00:47:12,109 --> 00:47:14,255
And if you're worried
about me,

564
00:47:14,678 --> 00:47:17,136
I promised myself that I wouldn't
make the same mistakes again.

565
00:47:18,539 --> 00:47:20,260
I’ve been a cheater before.

566
00:47:20,486 --> 00:47:22,094
I’m also mad at cheaters.

567
00:47:22,573 --> 00:47:23,783
I promise, Nica.

568
00:47:25,322 --> 00:47:27,073
I’m not saying anything.

569
00:47:31,719 --> 00:47:33,676
But, thanks for saying that.

570
00:47:35,079 --> 00:47:38,872
Well, I know it’s just talk right now.

571
00:47:39,952 --> 00:47:42,320
But, hopefully one day,
I can prove it to you.

572
00:47:44,382 --> 00:47:45,382
Well,

573
00:47:46,211 --> 00:47:49,506
that strong punch a while
ago was pretty convincing.

574
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:52,490
Of course, that’s what these are for.

575
00:47:53,325 --> 00:47:54,954
- How about this?
- Ouch.

576
00:47:55,503 --> 00:47:58,005
Sorry, I forgot that
you got hit there.

577
00:47:58,512 --> 00:47:59,512
Yeah.

578
00:48:00,149 --> 00:48:01,149
Here.

579
00:48:02,269 --> 00:48:03,442
Thank you.

580
00:48:04,906 --> 00:48:05,949
Yeah.

581
00:48:06,670 --> 00:48:08,962
- Here?
- Yeah, yeah.

582
00:48:09,387 --> 00:48:10,536
Thank you.

583
00:48:11,626 --> 00:48:12,873
It’s okay. I’m okay.

584
00:48:16,922 --> 00:48:23,005
Let’s just promise not to fool anyone

585
00:48:23,411 --> 00:48:25,398
that we say that we love, okay?

586
00:48:26,304 --> 00:48:28,044
And also don’t get fooled.

587
00:48:29,303 --> 00:48:30,303
Got it?

588
00:48:30,531 --> 00:48:31,531
Well said.

589
00:48:31,881 --> 00:48:32,881
Cheers to that!

590
00:48:42,915 --> 00:48:44,166
Where are the others?

591
00:48:45,742 --> 00:48:46,990
How are they?

592
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:49,243
That's a good question.

593
00:48:50,357 --> 00:48:52,079
Is Tacks still a virgin?

594
00:48:52,727 --> 00:48:54,057
We’re not sure.

595
00:48:54,490 --> 00:48:55,886
Tony has her ways.

596
00:48:56,765 --> 00:48:58,517
You have a point.

597
00:48:59,045 --> 00:49:01,548
For sure, Pancho is enjoying right now.

598
00:49:02,331 --> 00:49:03,457
True!

599
00:49:09,374 --> 00:49:10,979
How about us?

600
00:49:15,115 --> 00:49:19,828
Well, we can't force these things.

601
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:22,300
I think it's too soon.

602
00:49:24,672 --> 00:49:26,757
Yeah, you're right.

603
00:49:30,636 --> 00:49:32,203
Wherever destiny takes us.

604
00:49:35,516 --> 00:49:37,850
It's only been a few nights,
but I know this time...

605
00:49:39,314 --> 00:49:40,690
I can wait.

606
00:49:45,067 --> 00:49:46,135
Cheers.

607
00:50:11,174 --> 00:50:12,176
Why?

608
00:50:12,284 --> 00:50:13,342
Nothing.

609
00:50:21,283 --> 00:50:22,355
Why?

610
00:50:23,601 --> 00:50:25,135
Don’t hurt me, okay?

611
00:50:25,517 --> 00:50:26,522
I promise.

612
00:53:52,557 --> 00:53:54,225
I’m okay.
How about you?

613
00:53:55,460 --> 00:53:56,487
That's good.

614
00:53:58,131 --> 00:53:59,434
Look at this view.

615
00:54:02,504 --> 00:54:03,504
Right?

616
00:54:05,511 --> 00:54:07,322
I might come home tonight, or tomorrow.

617
00:54:08,261 --> 00:54:09,323
Yeah.

618
00:54:09,573 --> 00:54:10,693
Just here in the south area.

619
00:54:10,994 --> 00:54:13,562
- Yes, of course.
- I really miss you.

620
00:54:13,772 --> 00:54:14,898
Miss?

621
00:54:15,150 --> 00:54:16,164
Already?

622
00:54:17,335 --> 00:54:19,127
Then you should have came with us.

623
00:54:20,488 --> 00:54:22,015
Yeah, yeah.
The signal is weak.

624
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:23,386
The messages are delayed.

625
00:54:23,469 --> 00:54:25,268
Ralph, I still love you.

626
00:54:25,293 --> 00:54:26,415
Still love me?

627
00:54:28,394 --> 00:54:29,394
I have to go.

628
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:30,977
I'll call you when I get home.

629
00:54:31,580 --> 00:54:34,196
Oh, by the way,
I have something important to tell you.

630
00:54:34,783 --> 00:54:35,909
- All right.
- Bye.

631
00:54:35,934 --> 00:54:37,257
I'll talk to you later. Bye.

632
00:54:53,321 --> 00:54:54,364
Nica?

633
00:55:05,270 --> 00:55:06,296
Cheers!

634
00:55:07,285 --> 00:55:09,495
It’s so beautiful here.

635
00:55:09,977 --> 00:55:13,397
This is a nice place to go
to when you have problems.

636
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:16,643
The view is good.

637
00:55:17,861 --> 00:55:19,070
The weather is nice.

638
00:55:19,106 --> 00:55:22,277
You can clearly
think about stuff here.

639
00:55:23,081 --> 00:55:25,417
Pancho, Tacks, where’s Nica?

640
00:55:26,999 --> 00:55:28,444
We haven’t seen her yet.

641
00:55:29,288 --> 00:55:32,332
Maybe she’s in the
cabin with the girls.

642
00:55:32,357 --> 00:55:34,379
Okay. Thanks, guys.

643
00:55:34,404 --> 00:55:36,096
- Have a drink!
- I'll come back.

644
00:55:44,816 --> 00:55:46,443
What’s your problem?

645
00:55:54,634 --> 00:55:56,831
Who made you angry?

646
00:55:58,209 --> 00:55:59,252
Did Jam come back?

647
00:56:01,448 --> 00:56:04,410
You invited us here,
then you’ll leave us?

648
00:56:07,259 --> 00:56:08,418
Let’s go home.

649
00:56:09,212 --> 00:56:10,873
What happened?

650
00:56:11,847 --> 00:56:13,765
Your favorite prince.

651
00:56:14,422 --> 00:56:15,924
What did Ralph do?

652
00:56:18,484 --> 00:56:20,056
Just when I thought I was okay,

653
00:56:20,477 --> 00:56:22,174
I found out that he has a girlfriend.

654
00:56:24,468 --> 00:56:27,216
Screw those men.
They’re all the same.

655
00:56:27,389 --> 00:56:29,625
We don't understand.
Tell us what's going on.

656
00:56:30,747 --> 00:56:33,448
I caught him talking to someone else.

657
00:56:33,526 --> 00:56:34,819
He was in a video call.

658
00:56:36,676 --> 00:56:41,109
Why? Maybe it’s his relative,
or a best friend?

659
00:56:42,155 --> 00:56:43,155
Right?

660
00:56:43,917 --> 00:56:45,126
Have you talked to him?

661
00:56:45,998 --> 00:56:47,450
There’s no need.

662
00:56:48,115 --> 00:56:49,283
I heard everything.

663
00:56:49,706 --> 00:56:50,748
I saw it.

664
00:56:50,888 --> 00:56:52,098
Why?

665
00:56:52,123 --> 00:56:53,165
Are you together?

666
00:56:53,190 --> 00:56:54,191
No.

667
00:56:55,088 --> 00:56:57,192
If that's the case,
why are you acting that way?

668
00:56:58,608 --> 00:57:02,327
They’re not together,
but she loves him.

669
00:57:02,414 --> 00:57:03,540
To be confirmed.

670
00:57:04,998 --> 00:57:06,143
Oh, dear...

671
00:57:06,241 --> 00:57:07,290
Check.

672
00:57:09,829 --> 00:57:10,914
Nica!

673
00:57:12,206 --> 00:57:13,666
I’ve been looking for you.

674
00:57:15,669 --> 00:57:16,962
You two need to talk.

675
00:57:17,990 --> 00:57:19,450
About what?

676
00:57:22,306 --> 00:57:23,306
Nica?

677
00:57:26,554 --> 00:57:28,139
She said, you're still a cheater.

678
00:57:29,629 --> 00:57:30,701
What happened?

679
00:57:31,125 --> 00:57:35,058
She saw and heard you
talking to your girlfriend.

680
00:57:35,607 --> 00:57:36,607
So?

681
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:38,309
- What?
- Talk to her.

682
00:57:38,334 --> 00:57:39,334
I was...

683
00:57:39,681 --> 00:57:40,681
Nica!

684
00:57:41,039 --> 00:57:42,499
Geez, Ralph.

685
00:57:46,636 --> 00:57:48,179
The view is nice here.

686
00:57:51,143 --> 00:57:53,413
Hey! Have you guys seen Nica?

687
00:57:54,340 --> 00:57:55,758
You’re still looking for her?

688
00:57:55,783 --> 00:57:56,865
Haven’t you seen her?

689
00:57:58,408 --> 00:57:59,911
Actually, bro.

690
00:58:00,336 --> 00:58:01,671
It looks like she’s crying.

691
00:58:01,997 --> 00:58:02,997
She went that way.

692
00:58:03,393 --> 00:58:04,714
She even ignored us.

693
00:58:05,298 --> 00:58:06,966
What happened there?

694
00:58:07,471 --> 00:58:08,471
Hey!

695
00:58:15,278 --> 00:58:16,278
Nica?

696
00:58:18,219 --> 00:58:19,219
Nica?

697
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:21,240
Stay there!

698
00:58:22,236 --> 00:58:23,863
Is there a problem?

699
00:58:31,244 --> 00:58:32,292
Be honest.

700
00:58:32,719 --> 00:58:33,925
Do you have a girlfriend?

701
00:58:34,007 --> 00:58:35,007
None.

702
00:58:37,714 --> 00:58:39,239
“I miss you already.”

703
00:58:40,262 --> 00:58:41,930
“You should’ve came with us.”

704
00:58:42,536 --> 00:58:43,870
“I really love you.”

705
00:58:45,622 --> 00:58:46,622
Is that it?

706
00:58:47,586 --> 00:58:48,586
Wait.

707
00:58:48,919 --> 00:58:50,844
You don’t need to lie anymore.

708
00:58:52,749 --> 00:58:53,869
We’re not in a relationship.

709
00:58:55,380 --> 00:58:56,533
You just want to make people fall for you.

710
00:58:56,921 --> 00:58:58,214
And when they fall for you...

711
00:58:58,238 --> 00:58:59,656
Just listen.

712
00:59:00,106 --> 00:59:01,649
Before you get mad.

713
00:59:02,363 --> 00:59:04,491
The girl I was talking to is Trix.

714
00:59:04,987 --> 00:59:05,987
She’s my ex.

715
00:59:06,785 --> 00:59:08,276
That's the girl I cheated on.

716
00:59:10,823 --> 00:59:12,492
She forgave me for what I did.

717
00:59:12,517 --> 00:59:15,260
So when she heard that I’ve changed,
and that I'm still single,

718
00:59:15,333 --> 00:59:16,537
she wanted me back.

719
00:59:17,194 --> 00:59:18,205
The problem is...

720
00:59:18,514 --> 00:59:19,514
Me.

721
00:59:19,853 --> 00:59:20,853
I don’t want her anymore.

722
00:59:21,406 --> 00:59:22,406
I've moved on.

723
00:59:23,370 --> 00:59:24,955
I only see her as a friend.

724
00:59:25,281 --> 00:59:26,281
Because...

725
00:59:28,961 --> 00:59:31,132
I've fallen for somebody else.

726
00:59:40,008 --> 00:59:41,220
Really, Nica?

727
00:59:41,542 --> 00:59:43,169
You’ll get swayed again?

728
00:59:44,249 --> 00:59:47,254
Okay, I’ve never done this before...

729
00:59:48,582 --> 00:59:49,905
But I’ll do this for you.

730
00:59:55,561 --> 00:59:56,773
Cross my heart.

731
00:59:56,906 --> 00:59:58,546
And to all the wrong things in the world.

732
01:00:00,128 --> 01:00:02,214
Trix is not my girlfriend.

733
01:00:02,812 --> 01:00:04,137
She’s the one approaching me.

734
01:00:04,162 --> 01:00:05,664
I’m just civil with her.

735
01:00:05,689 --> 01:00:06,689
That's it.

736
01:00:07,908 --> 01:00:08,909
No more.

737
01:00:08,934 --> 01:00:10,144
No less.

738
01:00:12,703 --> 01:00:13,766
I promise.

739
01:00:14,687 --> 01:00:16,773
I've been honest with you
since day one.

740
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:18,688
I'll admit...

741
01:00:19,275 --> 01:00:21,551
I don't want to go back to her
since the moment I got to know you.

742
01:00:22,775 --> 01:00:23,775
Last night felt...

743
01:00:25,112 --> 01:00:26,864
felt different.

744
01:00:28,558 --> 01:00:30,537
I saw everything that
I've been looking for.

745
01:00:31,889 --> 01:00:33,524
The one that matches my energy.

746
01:00:34,138 --> 01:00:35,640
And that's you, Nica.

747
01:00:36,530 --> 01:00:37,656
I swear.

748
01:00:41,656 --> 01:00:42,949
You’re just swayed by the moment.

749
01:00:42,974 --> 01:00:44,307
With what happened last night.

750
01:00:46,798 --> 01:00:47,924
Maybe.

751
01:00:49,421 --> 01:00:50,421
But me...

752
01:00:50,968 --> 01:00:52,595
I won’t get swayed anymore.

753
01:00:55,262 --> 01:00:57,014
As long as you’re having fun.

754
01:00:57,953 --> 01:00:59,163
I will wait for you.

755
01:00:59,899 --> 01:01:01,264
I don’t believe you.

756
01:01:01,751 --> 01:01:02,751
Promise.

757
01:01:05,196 --> 01:01:06,286
Pinky swear?

758
01:01:13,099 --> 01:01:14,856
Yuck, cheesy.

759
01:01:15,705 --> 01:01:16,769
Why?

760
01:01:17,112 --> 01:01:19,076
It’s good to be cheesy once in a while.

761
01:01:22,424 --> 01:01:23,424
Hey.

762
01:01:23,758 --> 01:01:27,721
Let me see a smile.

763
01:01:29,073 --> 01:01:30,090
Give me a hug.

764
01:01:30,305 --> 01:01:31,347
Please.

765
01:01:56,088 --> 01:01:58,429
Thank you for giving me a second chance.

766
01:01:59,699 --> 01:02:01,242
I’m also an open-minded person..

767
01:02:02,390 --> 01:02:03,599
Really?

768
01:02:03,763 --> 01:02:05,300
Earlier, you were an over thinker.

769
01:02:07,538 --> 01:02:12,363
You know what, I’m a
conventional type of person.

770
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:15,267
Especially on personal matters.

771
01:02:16,704 --> 01:02:20,618
Because when I love someone,
I really love them.

772
01:02:23,721 --> 01:02:26,807
I’m very loyal in my personal affairs.

773
01:02:29,366 --> 01:02:31,856
But I’ve learned now that we
should know how to have fun.

774
01:02:34,733 --> 01:02:38,445
And not to give everything away.

775
01:02:40,774 --> 01:02:42,341
As long as it's clear with you.

776
01:02:43,138 --> 01:02:44,494
Clear with us.

777
01:02:46,657 --> 01:02:47,728
You're right.

778
01:02:47,911 --> 01:02:50,205
You can't force something
you don't mutually agree on.

779
01:02:51,057 --> 01:02:54,644
Respect for the things we think and feel.

780
01:02:54,669 --> 01:02:57,274
So if you're saying that
you just want to be happy.

781
01:02:57,814 --> 01:02:58,975
Then that's what we'll do.

782
01:02:59,171 --> 01:03:00,484
Just explore.

783
01:03:01,222 --> 01:03:03,467
Let's just see where it takes us.

784
01:03:04,088 --> 01:03:05,173
Okay.

785
01:03:10,513 --> 01:03:11,725
Is it getting warm?

786
01:03:13,373 --> 01:03:14,624
Yes, it is.

787
01:03:15,860 --> 01:03:18,070
Why has the night started to get warm?

788
01:05:41,266 --> 01:05:42,319
Come here.
