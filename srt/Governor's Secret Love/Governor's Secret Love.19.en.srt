You fixed it?

You're depending on it.

00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,280
So don't lose it again.

I believe fate lies in one's hands.

I don't think

00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,160
you even plan on making
a living out there.

24
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,760
You just want to freeload off

Do you have
anything you want to say to me?

For heaven's sake, Chief Eunuch.

29
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,480
I've been searching for you everywhere.

30
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,800
Did anything happen?

31
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,360
The Duke of Defender has returned.

32
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,440
His Majesty has summoned you
to the palace urgently.

33
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,800
Please come with me quickly.

34
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,240
Murong Cang,

35
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,640
do you have
anything you want to say to me?

36
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:12,960
Stay put.

37
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,200
Without my permission,

38
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,160
you're not allowed to go anywhere.

39
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,880
(Many things)

40
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,840
(in this world have wronged me.)

41
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,960
(Why are you the only one)

42
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,760
(I've wronged?)

43
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,680
(It would be nice
if we were just two ordinary kids)

44
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,080
(from ordinary families.)

45
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,640
(Murong Cang,)

46
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,120
(I won't let you die.)

47
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,680
(I'll change)

48
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,240
(your fate.)

49
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,080
The Duke of Defender has arrived!

50
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,720
Greetings, Your Majesty.

51
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,480
Please rise, Uncle.

52
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,440
You must be weary from your journey.

53
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,680
Thank you for your concern,
Your Majesty.

54
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,480
It wasn't arduous at all.

55
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,640
Leading the troops
to protect the country,

56
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,840
swearing to fight to the death,

57
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,000
and preparing to die

58
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,880
are my duties to the country.

59
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,320
But as a eunuch,

60
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,280
Murong Cang dares
to give orders in this great hall.

61
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,600
How can this be allowed?

62
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,960
You're young and inexperienced.

63
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,840
Seeing how you were being deceived
by this eunuch's cunning words,

64
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,640
which enabled him to cause disorder
in the imperial court,

65
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,520
is my negligence as your subject.

66
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,720
Duke of Defender, you seem

67
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,560
to misunderstand the Chief Eunuch.

68
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,000
Both of you are important to me.

69
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:35,080
This eunuch executed
General Hu privately.

70
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,000
Why do you remain stubborn,
Your Majesty?

71
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,320
The Chief Eunuch is practically lawless

72
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,800
and shamelessly abusing his power.

73
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:46,120
He's completely disregarding you,
Your Majesty.

74
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,200
General Hu embezzled
disaster relief funds,

75
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,000
colluded with bandits,
and committed crimes.

76
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,240
He was corrupt and oppressed the people.

77
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,040
After committing such heinous crimes,
even death is too light for him.

78
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,200
Do you only care

79
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,440
about political alliances
and engage in private interests,

80
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,320
but not the people's will?

81
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,720
This petition represents
the people's will.

82
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,640
Executing General Hu may not be lawful.

83
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,240
But it brings relief to the people.

84
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,760
In that case,

85
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,200
I've misunderstood you.

86
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:26,640
While General Hu's execution
was not by the law,

87
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:30,680
bringing great relief
to the people was a good thing.

88
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,160
Duke of Defender,
you sure are upright and just.

89
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,280
Someone.

90
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,520
Imperial Physician Yang?

91
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,440
I don't quite understand

92
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,120
this gift of yours, Your Grace.

93
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,760
There are no secrets in this world,
you know?

94
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,440
Chief Eunuch,

95
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,760
it's not easy

96
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,320
to pretend to be a eunuch.

97
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,200
Duke of Defender,
choose your words carefully.

98
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,640
I personally appointed the Chief Eunuch.

99
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,240
I will not tolerate any criticism.

100
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,000
Your Majesty, I understand.

101
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,800
Official Murong has worked hard
and rendered merits.

102
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,960
He's also favored by Your Majesty.

103
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,880
So it doesn't matter
if he's a real eunuch.

104
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,800
But Imperial Physician Yang

105
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,480
didn't verify Chief Eunuch's identity.

106
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,560
He abused his power for personal gain

107
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,160
and deceived his ruler.

108
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,720
I'm here

109
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,600
to rid the imperial court
of dishonest people

110
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,120
on Your Majesty's behalf.

111
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,480
I hope Your Majesty

112
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,800
won't blame me

113
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,840
for my intentions.

114
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,760
I dare not reject

115
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,840
your goodwill.

116
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,200
It's just a small gift.

117
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,000
Chief Eunuch,
why are you being courteous?

118
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,160
You...

119
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:19,640
Your Grace,

120
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,960
have you seen this sword?

121
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,960
I've seen many swords

122
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,440
on the battlefield.

123
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,680
But this one seems average.

124
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:36,400
It doesn't appear to be crafted
by a renowned artisan.

125
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:40,560
You're right.

126
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:42,520
This sword

127
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,480
was used in wiping out a clan
by a gang of bandits.

128
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,800
I didn't know you paid attention

129
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,680
to the matters of crime and violence.

130
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,000
I do.

131
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:57,120
Their whereabouts may be mysterious.

132
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,200
But

133
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,240
I've already made them pay
the price they deserved.

134
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,680
Princess Xueqing has arrived!

135
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,560
Greetings, Your Majesty.

136
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:45,280
Father, why did you return to court

137
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,280
before seeing me at home?

138
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,880
Xueqing, what are you doing here?

139
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,720
Father, you've been away
fighting in wars

140
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,000
and risking your life for a long time.

141
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,120
As your daughter,

142
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,520
it's only natural for me
to visit you first.

143
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,800
Can't you see
what kind of situation this is?

144
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,160
You're increasingly forgetting
your manners.

145
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,280
Father...

146
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,040
Forgive me for my clumsiness.

147
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,120
You fool!

148
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,440
How dare you lose your propriety
before His Majesty.

149
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,880
Hurry up and leave!

150
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,320
Yes, Your Highness.

151
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,480
Stop right there.

152
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,120
You, there.

153
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,560
Turn around and let me see you.

154
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,360
Xueqing?

155
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,600
Father?

156
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,080
You've returned?

157
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,240
(What is she doing here?)

158
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,320
