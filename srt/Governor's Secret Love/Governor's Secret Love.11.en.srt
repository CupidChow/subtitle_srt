[Governor's Secret Love]
[Episode 11]

2
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,480
Please get up, General Hu.

3
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,040
Your Majesty, Xueqing is the blue blood.

4
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,520
How dare a eunuch threaten her.

5
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,120
If you disagree with this,

6
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,800
I'll be held accountable

7
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,560
when the Duke of Defender returns.

8
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,000
I'd rather take my life

9
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:54,440
before your witness.

10
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:57,560
General Hu.

11
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,520
Are you threatening me?

12
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:01,400
Your Majesty,

13
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,280
punish me if you like.

14
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,720
By the edict of His Majesty,

15
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,400
you defied and abducted
Princess Xueqing.

16
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,000
This is a humiliating

17
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,080
and rebellious act
to the imperial family.

18
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,040
Due to your dedicated service,
you'll be granted a dignified death.

19
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:22,160
The execution will be carried out
in seven days. That's all.

20
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,040
Come with us, Eunuch Fugui.

21
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,200
This is nonsense!

22
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,040
Xueqing started the row first.

23
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,440
You can't take Fugui with you.

24
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,040
Insolent! Do you intend
to defy the imperial edict?

25
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,280
I dare not. But I'm desperate now.

26
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,840
I accept the charge.

27
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,080
Fugui, tell them

28
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:46,880
the truth.

29
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:47,760
You threatened Princess Xueqing

30
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,840
because you wanted to save me.

31
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,760
Tell the truth now.

32
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,040
Jixiang.

33
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,520
Chief Eunuch saved my life before.

34
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:54,800
From now on,

35
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,160
please take care of him on my behalf.

36
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:04,720
We should leave now.

37
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,200
Come on.

38
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:09,520
Chief Eunuch.

39
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,880
You can't let them take Fugui away.

40
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,560
Fugui!

41
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,440
Jixiang.

42
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,080
Stop.

43
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,800
The Duke of Defender is returning soon.

44
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,000
I planned to make Princess Xueqing

45
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,640
to break off the engagement

46
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,480
and send you to the prison

47
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,840
as to cover your movement

48
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,120
when you gather evidence
to bring General Hu down.

49
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,280
But the plan went south.

50
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:48,920
You're meticulous.

51
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,800
Jixiang was eager to save me

52
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,320
so she ruined the plan.

53
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,760
Please don't blame her, Your Majesty.

54
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,320
I can't believe
you'd plead for a servant.

55
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,880
I'm getting more curious

56
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,760
about Jixiang.

57
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,200
She's a soothsayer.

58
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,800
She saved my life several times.

59
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,120
She told me about that before.

60
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,640
At this rate, what's your next step?

61
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,720
I've already investigated
the ledgers and witnesses

62
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,520
for the embezzlement of military
and relief funds done by General Hu.

63
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,720
I hid it in the Longevity Shrine.

64
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,240
All we need to do now

65
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,640
is ask Fugui to bring them back.

66
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,760
Fugui?

67
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,480
Do you mean we should stick to the plan?

68
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,920
Eunuch Fugui will execute the plan.

69
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,400
He's my trusted aide.
We can rely on him.

70
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,040
In the coming days,
I'll pretend to leave the capital

71
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,160
to keep Fugui's tracks covered.

72
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,160
Even if we find the evidence,

73
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,320
Eunuch Fugui still can't escape
the death sentence.

74
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,560
With the Duke of Defender on his side,

75
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,800
General Hu is unlikely

76
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,720
to acknowledge
the testimony and ledgers.

77
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,080
No.

78
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:50,000
I will trade these ledgers to General Hu

79
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,280
for Fugui's safety.

80
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,920
What do you mean?

81
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,440
We have been waiting in the wings

82
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,840
to take revenge against them,
haven't we?

83
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,680
If you were to hand over
the evidence to General Hu,

84
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,840
how about our revenge?

85
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,760
Be patient, Your Majesty.

86
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,240
As you said,

87
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,400
General Hu is unlikely to own up

88
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,040
even if we've found
solid evidence of their doings.

89
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:08,240
On that note,
why don't we use this chance

90
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,560
to lower his guard against us?

91
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,040
General Hu

92
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,480
passes himself off as a tough man,

93
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,920
but in fact, he's a coward.

94
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,880
Who knows, he might be of use to us.

95
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,920
What's our next step, then?

96
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,240
What if

97
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,400
we have the petition from the people?

98
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,320
Chief Eunuch.

99
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,560
Chief Eunuch.

100
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,160
What's the matter?

101
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,000
Fugui has been serving you
all this time.

102
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,400
Why are you leaving for duty

103
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,800
at a critical moment like this?

104
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,720
Do you have no sympathy?

105
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,760
Sympathy?

106
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,920
What makes you think I have sympathy?

107
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,440
Fine.

108
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,720
Be that as it may,

109
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,440
I'm the reason
for his current situation.

110
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,440
Could you tell His Majesty

111
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,480
that I want to trade my life

112
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,600
for Fugui's freedom?

113
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:02,760
Jixiang.

114
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,720
Does the bond

115
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,760
between you and Eunuch Fugui
grow so deep

116
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,320
in just a few days?

117
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,280
All I know is

118
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,800
one should have sympathy and reasons.

119
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,760
We serve the same master here.

120
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,000
Besides, he's condemned to execution

121
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,200
because of me.

122
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,720
I must save him for whatever reason.

123
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,680
He always teases me,

124
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,600
however, that has nothing
to do with this.

125
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,040
For whatever reason?

126
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,120
What a sound logic you have.

127
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,040
Mind you,

128
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,680
do you think
the frigging Hu has sympathy

129
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,640
and Princess Xueqing has reasons?

130
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:47,280
Many people in this world have died

131
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,480
without knowing why.

132
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,960
Do you think
they are just random tragedies?

133
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,640
To deal with this riff-raff,

134
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,640

You're just a servant here.

145
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,440
You're in no place
to tell me what to do.

146
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,120
I didn't mean that.

147
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,280
I'm just begging you to save Fugui.

148
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,440
He's my servant.

149
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,680
Not your friend.

150
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,320
He saved you because I ordered him so.

151
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,440
Also,

152
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,480
don't

153
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,960
point your finger at me.

154
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,240
Murong Cang.

Jixiang.

156
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,080
Jixiang.

157
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,280
What happened? What's the hurry?

158
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,520
Something bad has happened!

159
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,040
I got news from the palace.

160
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,240
Eunuch Fugui

161
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,200
will be executed tomorrow.

162
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,760
How could that be?
It's supposed to be seven days later.

163
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,440
I have no idea.

164
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:34,640
Little brat, you'll come to me.

165
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,480
It must be her.

166
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,480
I prepared this for Fugui.

167
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,520
Please send this to him.

168
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:42,760
Jixiang.

169
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,720
Jixiang, where are you going?

170
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:48,340
(Duke of Defender's Mansion)

171
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,160
Your Highness.

172
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,200
Your Highness.

173
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,800
Your Highness.

174
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,000
Open the door.

175
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,360
Your Highness.

176
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,720
Your Highness.

177
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,920
Princess Xueqing.

178
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,880
Your Highness.

179
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,640
Please open the door.

180
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,880
I know you'll come here.

181
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,120
But you're later than I expected.

182
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,720
It's getting dark.

183
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,240
I should rest up now.

184
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,680
Please leave.

185
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,600
Your Highness.

186
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,360
Chief Eunuch's favorite

187
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,920
is kneeling at my door.

188
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,560
People might misunderstand me

189
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,000
for having a beef

190
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,280
with Chief Eunuch.

191
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,440
Come in.

192
00:08:54,540 --> 00:09:02,940
(Duke of Defender's Mansion)

193
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,440
Your Highness.

194
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,320
I'm your target.

195
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,600
So here I am.

196
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,440
Please release Fugui.

197
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:24,000
I was expecting another surprise
from you, though.

198
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,200
Anyway,

199
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,200
it's good.

200
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,960
Murong Cang will lose
his interest in you.

201
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,000
This is a misunderstanding.

202
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,840
Chief Eunuch

203
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,680
is my godfather.

204
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,160
Misunderstanding, you say?

205
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:42,720
Why?

206
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,440
Do you mean

207
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,560
you don't like Murong Cang?

208
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,400
Your Highness.

209
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,120
I beg of you.

210
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,160
Please release Fugui.

211
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,080
I might consider that.

212
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,360
To be honest,

213
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,120
I'm averse to blood.

214
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,520
However,

215
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,000
my life is too boring.

216
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,920
You won't understand this, anyway.

217
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,240
Are you saying
that you agree to release him?

218
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,560
I always know

219
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,160
you're beautiful and kind.

220
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,440
You're blessed with great fortune.

221
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:38,960
How about this?

222
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,640
Let's play a game.

223
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,040
I'll give you two options.

224
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,520
The first option,

225
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,760
I'll give you some money.

226
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,680
Go anywhere you want

227
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,560
and never appear

228
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,160
before Murong Cang.

229
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:56,880
The second option...

230
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,560
I'll take the second option.

231
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,480
The second option is

232
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,360
to go to the back garden and kneel.

233
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,120
The longer you kneel,

234
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:11,480
the later I'll postpone his execution.
How does that sound?

235
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:12,840
I'll do it.

236
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,640
You didn't hesitate.

237
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,320
No second thoughts?

238
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,680
No. Thank you, Your Highness.

239
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,120
Very good.

240
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,720
In that case,

00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,880
