00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,280
Murong Cang, what brings you back?

3
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,920
You heard my voice, didn't you?

He annoyed me in the first place.

7
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:48,880
He's merely a servant.

8
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,440
Just kill him.

9
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,440
Calm down, Your Highness.

10
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,120
I failed to teach my servants.

11
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,560
However, please have mercy

12
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,720
on my servant.

13
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,400
You...

14
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,640
This is exactly why I'm so into you.

15
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,760
(Is she sick in the head?)

16
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,520
Your Highness, you're of noble origin.

17
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,960
Please don't let me

18
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,000
keep you.

19
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,240
See her off.

20
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,120

I'm so sorry, Chief Eunuch.

28
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,280
Well done, Jixiang.

29
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,000
Impressive.

30
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,320
Enough.

31
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,640
How bold of you

32
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,280
to defy the princess.

33
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,720
As your master,

34
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,840
I won't leave you in danger.

35
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,600
If there ever is a next time,

36
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,160
I won't interfere again.

37
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,200
Did you hear me?

38
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,320
Yes. Understood.

39
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,440
I hate to see blood on my servants.

40
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,680
Chief Eunuch,
Imperial Physician Yang has arrived.

41
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,240
Eunuch Ankang has gone to receive him.

42
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,040
All right.

43
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,040
Wait.

44
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,320
What's this smell?

45
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:51,880
Chief Eunuch.

46
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:55,280
Eunuch Ankang said
the usual Wangyou Herb has run out.

47
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,600
This Tianshan Herb

48
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,760
also serves as a soothing herb.

49
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,720
Fool.

50
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,080
Don't you know Chief Eunuch
dislike unfamiliar things?

51
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,160
Put it out.

52
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,520
I'm to blame. I'll take it away.

53
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,760
It's fine. Take it away.

54
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:09,880
Yes.

55
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:19,880
You may leave.

56
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,040
Yes.

57
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,400
Hold on.

58
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:33,440
Yes, Chief Eunuch?

59
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,560
I'm fed up

60
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,560
seeing so many eunuchs

61
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,640
in the mansion.

62
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,280
In the future,

63
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,800
you wear women's clothing.

64
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,120
Really?

65
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,520
Thank you, Chief Eunuch.

66
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,440
This way, Imperial Physician Yang.

67
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,240
I'm so sorry. Sorry.

68
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,600
Did I hurt you?

69
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,440
Be careful.

70
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,160
I'm good.

71
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,120
I can manage on my own.

72
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,440
Let me help you.

73
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:25,120
Imperial Physician Yang,
do you recognize this golden hairpin?

74
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,760
It's my daughter's hairpin.

75
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,840
That's right.

76
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,600
Your wife and daughter are safe now.

77
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:30,600
But...

78
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,640
What?

79
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,440
I have a favor

80
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,880
to ask of you.

81
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,440
Hey, Jixiang.

82
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,880
Even though you're
Chief Eunuch's godson,

83
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,120
it doesn't mean
you can do anything you want.

84
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,120
Enough. We need to go now.

85
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,040
Eunuch Ankang.

86
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:51,800
Let's leave.

87
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,440
Please forgive me.

88
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,120
Please, Imperial Physician Yang.

89
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,600
(Why am I seeing)

90
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:05,280
(so many strange visions lately?)

91
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,480
Greetings, Chief Eunuch.

92
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,680
Please be at ease,
Imperial Physician Yang.

93
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:24,800
Leave us.

94
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,440
Mr. Yang.

95
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,600
Sit down.

96
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,320
Let me check on your wound.

97
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,680
Everyone in the capital knows
that Princess cut your hand.

98
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,360
I had no choice but to hurt myself

99
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,560
in order to meet you

100
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,360
without being noticed.

101
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,080
Show me your wound.

102
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,120
This is just minor.

103
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,200
Where else?

104
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:59,160
I knew you never
take good care of yourself

105
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,280
and travel around to investigate cases.

106
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,840
Your revenge...

107
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,760
I'm afraid you wouldn't
survive 25 years old

108
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,200
before you can take the revenge.

109
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,520
Don't worry.

110
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,680
I know what I'm doing.

111
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:20,760
Come.

112
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,520
What is it?

113
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,400
During the day, you said
Chief Eunuch suffered from...

114
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,920
Night terror.

115
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,240
What does that mean?

116
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,680
Don't tell anyone I told you.

117
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,560
My lips are sealed.

118
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,240
Fine. I'll tell you, then.

119
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,960
Years ago,

120
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,720
on a pitch-black night...

121
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,680
Your wound was well stitched.

122
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,520
Who did this?

123
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,360
A servant.

124
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,240
He doesn't know

125
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,000
about your identity, does he?

126
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,080
Don't worry.

127
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,440
I've already silenced that person.

128
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,840
Good, then.

129
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,360
I brought you this medication.

130
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,800
Send your men to prepare this.

131
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,880
Fugui and Ankang.

132
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,040
Yes.

133
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,360
Years ago,

134
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,880
a night watcher

135
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,520
came to the gate of Chief Eunuch's Mansion
out of curiosity.

136
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,720
Chief Eunuch's hair was disheveled
and his face was covered in blood.

137
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,440
He held a blood-stained sword
in his hand.

138
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,240
(His face was covered in blood?)

139
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,840
Dead bodies were strewn everywhere

140
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,000
with their eyes wide open.

141
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,560
It's scary.

142
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,120
What are you doing here?

143
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,640
Get back to your work now.

144
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,880
Yes, Eunuch Fugui.

145
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,240
You seem to have lots of free time.

146
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,560
We should go now, Fugui.

147
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,160
The Puhuang herbal soup
is going cold soon.

148
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,120
Its effect might be reduced.

149
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,600
Let's go.

150
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,640
Puhuang herbal soup?

151
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,320
Let's leave.

152
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,120
Wait.

153
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,360
You only told half of the story.

154
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,000
What happened next?

155
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,960
I have work to do.

156
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:05,920
If you're curious,

157
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,320
there's a storyteller
at the east street.

158
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,920
He tells the story
"The Revenge of Night Madman" every day.

159
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,960
Go and check it out.

160
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,800
A storyteller?

161
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,640
Puhuang and Tianshan Herb?

162
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Could it be...

163
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,120
Imperial Physician Yang
is well-versed in medication.

164
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:33,920
That's right.

165
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,720
The combination
of Puhuang and Tianshan Herb

166
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,720
makes the lethal poison.

167
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,640
Hey, Jixiang.

168
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,280
Even though you're
Chief Eunuch's godson,

169
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,560
it doesn't mean
you can do anything you want.

170
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,560
This is bad!

171
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,400
Ankang.

172
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,880
Please don't blame me.

173
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,520
I have to follow the rules.

174
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,600
You're prudent.

175
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,000
Chief Eunuch

176
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,120
has guided you well.

177
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,520
Chief Eunuch.

178
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:17,840
The herbal soup

179
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,040
isn't poisonous.

180
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,600
Bring it here.

181
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,200
Who prepared this?

182
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,840
Chief Eunuch.

183
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:41,320
It was Fugui.

184
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,600
All right.

185
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,320
Don't drink it!

186
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,120
Something's wrong
with this Puhuang herbal soup.

187
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:54,920
How dare you!

188
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,200
I tested it with a silver needle
just now.

189
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,840
It's completely fine.

190
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,480
It's fine if one takes
the Puhuang herbal soup alone.

191
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,520
However,

192
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,360
pairing it with Tianshan Herb
is a different case.

193
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,480
If the Puhuang herbal soup
and Tianshan Herb combine,

194
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,800
it becomes a poison beyond cure.

195
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,120
What nonsense are you spewing?

196
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,200
Imperial Physician Yang
wouldn't harm Chief Eunuch.

197
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,000
What if you kidnapped
his wife and daughter?

198
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,080
That's out of the question.

199
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,640
I pledge my loyalty to Chief Eunuch,

200
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:26,280
and I hold no grudges
against Imperial Physician Yang.

201
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,520
Do you have any proof

202
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,960
to justify your words?

203
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,000
Proof?

204
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,280
Here it is.

205
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,800
It was you.

206
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,680
Ankang, what has happened?

207
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,000
Let me go.

208
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,400
I want to leave this place.

209
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,040
What are you doing, Ankang?

210
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,840
Daft, I'm trying to keep my life safe.

211
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,400
Are you blind?

212
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,720
Kidnapping her is no use.

213
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,360
It's not a threat to Chief Eunuch.

214
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,480
Chief Eunuch only cares for me.

215
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,160
Fugui, you...

216
00:10:58,680 --> 00:10:59,400
Shut your stupid mouth,

217
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,120
will you?

218
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,920
You're pouring oil on the flames.

219
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,240
Shut your mouth.

220
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,640
What do you want?

221
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,520
Don't come any closer.

222
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,160
Ankang, calm down.

223
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,720
There must be

224
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,320
some reason, right?

225
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,880
I'm your master.

226
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,440
Tell me whatever you want.

227
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,920
I've been serving you for years.

228
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,440
But you never trusted anyone,

229
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,560
except for this girl.

230
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,360
She came from outside,

231
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,320
and yet she's allowed
to enter your room.

232
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,920
She means a lot to you, right?

233
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,520
She's useless.

234
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,760
I'm the useful one.

235
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,880
Ankang, put the dagger down.

236
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:38,800
Fugui.

237
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:40,800
Leave the room.

238
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,000
Don't do anything

239
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,640
or let anybody in.

240
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,080
Murong Cang.

241
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,360
You better not trick me.

242
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,040
If you want her to stay alive,

243
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,640
finish the Puhuang herbal soup.

244
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,560
No, don't drink it.

245
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:02,840
Shut up.

246
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,600
Murong...

247
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,600
Murong Cang.

248
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,760
I'll tell you the truth

249
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,480
before you die.

250
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,320
Every move of yours
is under my supervision.

251
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,560
I informed my master
about the route to suppress banditry.

252
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:27,480
Not only that,

253
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I know why you went to Longevity Shrine.

254
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:31,840
Close your eyes.

255
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,200
What did you say?

256
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,440
Jixiang, close your eyes.

257
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,200
