(The people around him
aren't to be messed with.)

8
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,280
(I must leave this place at once.)

9
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,000
(Maodan and the rest
are waiting for me.)

10

(These things)

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,840
(will be my wages for these days.)

(He should consider it as the alms.)

13
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,400
(No.)

14
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,200
(I better write a receipt for a loan.)

15
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,560
(Like a loan.)

16
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,000
(I think I've seen this paper before.)

17
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,920
(It's the letter Dullard gave me.)

18
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,400
(What a coincidence.)

19
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,920
(Maybe the papers in the palace
all look the same.)

(Why did you come out?)

23
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,160
She fainted.

24
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,560
It's going to be long sleep.

25
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,560
(Forget it.)

26
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,160

to flush the mole out.

Thank you, Uncle Yang.

43
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,640
Your father, Imperial Physician Mu,
saved my life.

44
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,880
I see him as my family.

Before we get our revenge,

46

I won't let anyone kill you.

Uncle Yang.

50
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,640
I was desperate back then.

51
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,160
It was you who sent me to the palace

52
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,680
and helped me avoid castration.

53

behind this poisoning incident.

I know very well

57

Please take care, Mr. Yang.

84

Since the physician said
you're hopeless,

85
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,400
keeping you here is no use.

86
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,520

How did you find that out?

99
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,640
Speaking of this,

100
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,040
I bet you know

101
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:36,080
I'm the well-known soothsayer
in Longevity Shrine.

102
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,040
I didn't know that,

103

nor had I heard it before.

104
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,680
Anyway,

105
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:43,880
when I touch someone

106
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,320
with my hand,

107
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,480
I could foresee their future.

108
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,560
Now tell me.

109
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,160
What did you see?

110
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,280
(Murong Cang is eccentric.)

111
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,600
(If I were to tell me
that his future is a mess,)

112
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,880

115

I saw

116
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,760
that you'll fall deeply for me.

117
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:14,600
You love me

118
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,240
in spite of yourself.

119
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,600
Nonsense!

120
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,240
There's something else.

121
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,800
You wouldn't want to beat me

122
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,160
or scold me.

123
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,440
Lowly maid.

124
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,120
How dare you slander Chief Eunuch!

125
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,880
This is demeaning.

126
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,720
You deserve a thousand deaths.

127
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,640
Chief Eunuch, she...

128
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,120
You said

129
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,360
that I would fall for you,

130
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,600
then why did you insist
on returning to the shrine?

131
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,040
I...

132
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,400
By any chance,

133
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,880
does your lover stay there?

134
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,640
That's not true.

135
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,360
I'm waiting for someone.

136
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,080
Waiting for someone?

137
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:00,960
Hmm.

138
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,880
If that person

139
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,960
really cares for you
more than anything else,

140
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,520
you wouldn't have to wait.

141
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,280
Since you said
that I would fall for you.

142
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,000
Tonight,

143
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,000
you're going to serve in my room.

144
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
- What?
- What?

145
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,320
Don't make me wait.

146
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:21,560
Otherwise, I'll kill you

147
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,200
before I fall in love with you.

148
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,000
All right.

149
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,840
This is strange.

150
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,120
Chief Eunuch never allows anyone
to serve in his room.

151
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,240
Why did he let her in?

152
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:40,320
Did this girl bewitch him?

153
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,600
The two of them...

154
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:45,920
What has gotten into me?

155
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,400
Chief Eunuch is a eunuch like me.

156
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,400
Women can't bewitch him.

157
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,240
Never.

158
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:58,840
Since

159
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,080
you predicted
that I would fall in love with you,

160
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,080
you shouldn't go back
to Longevity Shrine.

161
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:06,040
I don't like disloyal servants.

162
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,800
(You actually believed in that?)

163
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,760
(Fake eunuch, it's not going to happen.)

164
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,640

165

Please have a rest.

166
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,880
I should get going.

167
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,520
Continue.

168
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:22,680
Yes.

169

Previously,

170
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,600
you sang a nursery rhyme
in Longevity Shrine.

171

No.

179
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,800
I want to sing.

180
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,280

Dullard, will you stay with me forever?

188
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,880
No one can always stay with you.

189
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,840
I want to go home.

190
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,200
You don't have a home.

191
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,880
This is your home.

192
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,040
From now on,

193
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,040
this is your home.

194
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,480
What did you say?

195
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:01,840
Nothing.

196
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,680
I said I'm tired.

197
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,440
Please take a rest.

198
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,960
I'm leaving.

199
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,400
Hold on.

200
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,480
What's the matter, Godfather?

201
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,760
I've thought

202
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,800
your prophecy through,

203
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,800
I find it rather amusing.

Starting tonight,

208
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,320
you'll stay in my room.
