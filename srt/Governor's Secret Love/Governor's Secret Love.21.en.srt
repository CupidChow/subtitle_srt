[Governor's Secret Love]
[Episode 21]

2
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,160
(Sister.)

3
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,840
(I'm here to see you again.)

4
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,480
(I've been blaming myself)

5
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:26,680
(over the years.)

6
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,760
(Since the beginning,)

7
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:32,640
(I've imposed my desire
for power on you,)

8
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:36,880
(and treated you like a pawn.)

9
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,400
My sister

10
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,240
could foresee the future.

11
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,760
Ironically, her memory

12
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,000
is like a sieve.

13
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,520
Why don't you ask about

14
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,960
whether the baby
Her Highness is carrying in her belly

15
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,000
is a boy or a girl?

16
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:54,840
How dare you!

17
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,920
Who are you

18
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,080
to meddle in the imperial descendant?

19
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,600
I asked Physician Mu about that.

20
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:06,800
It's said that Lady Shu

21
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,280
and Her Highness are due
around the same time.

22
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,600
If this is a boy,

23
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,200
it can pose a threat

24
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,200
to our future.

25
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,880
If she were to give birth to a prince,

26
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,040
we can have Physician Mu

27
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:26,000
swap the princess for a prince.

28
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,520
Ridiculous!

29
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,880
This is absurd.

30
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:33,880
Your Grace.

31
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:37,240
Having a soft heart can ruin our plan.

32
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,280
Don't hesitate,

33
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,920
because our enemy

34
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,080
never hesitates.

35
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,480
The princess is adorable.

36
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,240
You haven't named her yet, right?

37
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,680
It snowed last night.

38
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,840
Let's call her Xueqing.

39
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,960
Xueqing? Good name.

40
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,640
(You're right.)

41
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,760
(I'm doing everything for my own greed.)

42
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,800
(It's never for the sake of you
and the clan, like I promised.)

43
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,960
Lady Shu.

44
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,280
Your Grace...

45
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,920
Keep your mouth

46
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,960
shut.

47
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:24,680
That way, the Mu clan

48
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,520
thrives,

49
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,200
or else...

50
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,600
(It's our fate.)

51
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,240
Hong, take this child

52
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,400
and hide somewhere.

53
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:52,880
All right.

54
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,240
Don't worry.

55
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:57,680
Stop.

56
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,120
Where are you going?

57
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,080
Give me that child.

58
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,440
Give it to me.

59
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:05,200
Brother.

60
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,240
What are you doing?

61
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,280
Sister.

62
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,920
For the sake of our future,

63
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,400
your child must be a boy.

64
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,000
No.

65
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,200
No!

66
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,520
Brother.

67
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,160
Hong.

68
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,520
Hong.

69
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,560
(Your death)

70
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,840
(completely awakened me.)

71
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,120
(Finally,)

72
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,720
(Xueqing, who has gone missing
for years, has returned.)

73
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,040
(She now goes by the name Yunjiao.)

74
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,080
(I'll keep good on the promise)

75
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,000
(and treat your daughter)

76
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,280
(as my only daughter.)

77
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,680
(I'll protect her from any harm.)

78
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,120
(Besides, I'll request
an imperial decree)

79
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,350
[Memorial Tablet of Sister, Liu Jingwan]
(to confer her as Princess Guyu)

80
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:10,600
(to make amends for what I've done
to you and your daughter.)

81
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,560
(Brother.)

82
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,760
(You promised to treat Xueqing
as your own daughter.)

83
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,320
(Please keep your promise.)

84
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,960
(Starting today,)

85
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,480
(you'll be her father.)

86
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:10,360
(But please, don't make her your pawn)

87
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:13,240
(in the power struggle like me.)

88
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,120
(Also,)

89
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,880
(Your Grace,)

90
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:23,480
(please hand over
my bracelet to Xueqing.)

91
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:48,920
The Duke of Defender is cunning.

92
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,240
For these years,

93
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,360
we haven't been able
to find solid evidence

94
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,920
against him.

95
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,720
Now that you've killed the Duke of Hu,

96
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,880
we lost

97
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,360
the only witness.

98
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,400
Your Majesty.

99
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,760
The best way at present

100
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,520
is to send me to the border

101
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,200
and seize control of his military power.

102
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,240
Murong Cang.

103
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,680
Don't tempt your fate.

104
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,640
You could die easily.

105
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,880
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

106
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,790
Instead, I realize that the Duke

107
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,360
cherishes Yunjiao very much.

108
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,040
Your Majesty.

109
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,160
It's better not

110
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,960
to get Yunjiao involved.

111
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,800
She's involved
the moment she falls in love with you.

112
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:50,520
Is it not?

113
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,760
I can't drag her down to the mire.

114
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,960
You can't?

115
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,800
What about me? What about us?

116
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,880
We've been waiting in the wings.

117
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,200
You are going to give up everything

118
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,040
merely for a woman?

119
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,680
Murong Cang.

120
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,360
Aren't you afraid that I'll kill you?

121
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,520
I'm afraid.

122
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,880
But I'm more afraid of hurting her.

123
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,920
Hurting her?

124
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,880
What about my mother

125
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,800
and the three families of the Mu clan?

126
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,120
I will surely avenge them.

127
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:19,920
You...

128
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,760
Here's a letter, Your Majesty.

129
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:27,440
Scram!

130
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:28,880
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

131
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,680
It's your instruction earlier.

132
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,280
Bring it here.

133
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,560
(I found evidence
against the Duke of Defender.)

tomorrow at the hour of Mao.)

aside from our social rank,

138
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,840
are we still friends?

139
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,360
You're the emperor,
and I'm your subject.

140
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,520
I dare not.
