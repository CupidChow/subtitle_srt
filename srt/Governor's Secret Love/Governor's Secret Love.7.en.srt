We're just like a regular godfather

185
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,800
and his ordinary lackey.

186
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,440
(She pushed me into the water
and nearly drowned me last time.)

187
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,920
(If I don't make her happy today,)

188
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,720
(I'm afraid I'll be in danger
sooner or later.)

189
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,360
Your Highness,

190
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,640
you indeed have discerning eyes
for people.

191
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,720
Such a keen insight.

192
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,480
I'll just be honest with you.

193
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:54,400
The reason I have such a relationship
with Chief Eunuch

194
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,680
is

195
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:59,320
I have an extraordinary ability
unknown to others.

196
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,680
I can foresee the future.

197
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,160
What?

198
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,200
I'm telling the truth.

199
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,280
You see.

200
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,120
Chief Eunuch

201
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,560
holds a high position.

202
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,800
But there are always bad people
trying to harm him.

203
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,440
With me around, I can warn him.

204
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,640
I've already saved him
from several assassination attempts.

205
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:25,320
Chief Eunuch trusts and protects me
because of this reason.

206
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,960
So that's why.

207
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:29,320
No wonder.

208
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,080
It was strange to me when Murong Cang

209
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,640
suddenly favored someone so much.

210
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,080
So what do you think

211
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,560
they're talking about?

212
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:38,640
Chief Eunuch,

213
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,280
we're eunuchs.

214
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,800
Why bother
with guessing women's affairs?

215
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,360
Since that's the case,
can you predict my future?

216
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:57,360
Yes, Your Highness.

217
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,160
(What should I do now?)

218
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,920
(The bracelet is missing,
and I can't see her future.)

219
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:12,920
So?

220
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,200
Tell me

221
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,040
what you saw.

222
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,120
I saw...

223
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,960
Your Highness, I saw...

224
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,280
What did you see?

225
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,400
Just tell me.

226
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,040
(Forget it.
I'll just make something up.)

227
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,520
I saw

228
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,160
that Chief Eunuch

229
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,800
use a rope this thick

230
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,240
to tie you up

231
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,600
and try to violate you.

232
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,040
What?

233
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,000
Your Highness,

234
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,120
Chief Eunuch
was so disrespectful to you.

235
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,040
If you believe me,

236
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,160
you should stay away from him
in the future.

237
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:57,920
Then

238
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,000
how exactly did he

239
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,640
being disrespectful

240
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,000
and how did he try to violate me?

241
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,680
Tell me in detail.

242
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,040
Well,

243
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,680
he first

244
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,480
tied you up like this.

245
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:18,080
Then he did this and that.

246
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,800
Oh, my.

247
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,880
Then he did this and that too.

248
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,200
Chief Eunuch,
you were worried about Jixiang's safety.

249
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,960
But he's reading
Princess Xueqing's future.

250
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,320
Unfaithful and disrespectful.

251
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,440
