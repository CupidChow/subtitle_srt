What's the matter?

205
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,280
Chief Eunuch.

206
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,400
His Majesty wants to see Jixiang alone.

207
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,200
What?

208
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,760
His Majesty wants to see me alone?

you know?

I...

213
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,920
Since His Majesty summons you,

214
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,120
you should go now.

215
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:10,160
Remember to be cautious
when you answer his questions.

216
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,200
Yes.

217
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,080
Understood.

218
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,200
Humph! You took advantage
of Chief Eunuch.

219
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,240
You'll suffer for this, social climber.

220
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:43,580
You entered the palace not long ago.

221
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,880
Murong Cang never allows
strangers to approach him.

222

I suppose there must be
something special about you.

00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,760
Your Majesty,

224
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,440
I'm a eunuch.

225
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,960
Nothing's special about a eunuch.

226
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,560
(He suspects me.)

227
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,440
(So he questions me
when Murong Cang isn't around.)

228
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,120
Your Majesty.

229
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:18,440
Chief Eunuch's falcon, Chuanyun,
is circling outside and screeching.

230
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,680
It pulls off its own feather.

231
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,960
