00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,560
Cheif Eunuch is not here.
Give me a break, please.

I know you're inside.

I may not have much strength,

8
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,200
but I can still open this door.

9
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,680
Don't worry.
I won't before you let me in.

10
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,800
I know

11
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,640
the hardest thing to open in this world

12
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,680
is a person's heart.

13
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,000
If you refuse to come out,

14
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,440
I can't go in either.

15
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:26,320
I know that.

16
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,760
So I'll wait for you here.

20
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,800
then I'll leave.

not miss Chief Eunuch, by the way?

Not at all.

135
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,040

He's so handsome.

137
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,440
You can't do that.

138
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,080
Do you think

139
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,760
I've misunderstood him?

140
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,080
Maybe he didn't lie to me.

141
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,680
You both

142
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,320
truly worry me.

143
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,840
Can't you just say or ask him

144
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,840
whatever you mean?

145
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,800
You've been holding it in
for over a year.

146
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,480
Don't you feel uncomfortable?

147
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,480
Say whatever I mean?

148
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,680
Well, I have a question to ask you.

149
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,480
Go on.

150
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,160
Why did you

151
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:09,120
bring me back to the mansion

152
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,800
and help me recognize the Duke?

153
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,080
Maybe because

154
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,960
I tried to be kind for once.

155
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,280
I'm kidding.

156
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,560
Actually, I intended

157
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,400
to try my luck

158
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,520
to see whether Father...

159
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:35,080
No, the Duke.

160
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,360
I wanted to know

161
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,960
if he truly

162
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,440
appreciated me.

163
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,440
But it proved

164
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,680
that it was a false hope.

165
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,600
I'm sorry, Xueqing.

166
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,000
Never apologize again.

167
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,760
Anyway, you managed to catch hold of me.

168
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,400
So we're even.

169
00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:59,760
All right, we're even.

170
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,240
Hurry up and dig in before it goes cold.

171
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,320
I heard that the Chief Eunuch
in the capital

172
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,040
is going to be beheaded
by the emperor.

173
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,600
A eunuch?

174
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,080
Pah.

175
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,920
How dare he call himself the chief.

176
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,080
He deserves it.

177
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,920
Excuse me, misses.

178
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,680
Does the Chief Eunuch you mentioned

179
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,200
have the surname Murong?

180
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,640
How do you know that?

181
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,720
That's what's written
on the announcement board.

182
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,600
He's going to be executed today
in Longevity Shrine.

183
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,240
Why are you still sitting here?

184
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,440
Go now.

185
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,360
I'm leaving.
