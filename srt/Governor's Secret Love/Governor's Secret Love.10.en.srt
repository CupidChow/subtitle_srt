[Governor's Secret Love]
[Episode 10]

2
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:41,360
Fugui.

3
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:42,800
Why do you think His Majesty

4
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:45,280
summoned Jixiang urgently
into the palace?

5
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:47,680
Could it be

6
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,720
His Majesty took a liking to Jixiang?

7
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,160
Mind your words.

8
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,440
Why would His Majesty fall for a eunuch?

9
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,480
Chief Eunuch,
just look at Jixiang's petite figure.

10
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,080
Other than

11
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,400
the slow-witted Princess Xueqing,

12
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,520
everyone can tell she's a lady.

13
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,240
All right.

14
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:05,160
Enough said.

15
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,640
(Why is he so nervous?)

16
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:13,840
Chief Eunuch, forgive me.

17
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,920
His Majesty has sent someone urgently
to summon you.

18
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,720
Did His Majesty mention
what the matter is?

19
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,760
I dare not ask more.

20
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,000
I think it's related to Jixiang.

21
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:23,920
Jixiang?

22
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,040
Why did His Majesty summon me here?

23
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,520
Well...

24
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:43,920
What's the meaning of this?

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,560
I ask you one more time.

26
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,960
Stop asking. It's me.

27
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,880
I told him to trick you here.

28
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,600
Jixiang.

29
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,240
Did you cause any trouble?

30
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,640
His Majesty urgently summoned
Chief Eunuch just now.

31
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,480
Nonsense. His Majesty never summoned
Chief Eunuch.

32
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,200
But he just left with Eunuch Wu.

33
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,280
Eunuch Wu? It sure was odd.

34
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:28,400
Usually, it's Eunuch Wang
who comes to summon Chief Eunuch.

35
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,480
Chief Eunuch is in trouble.

36
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,360
Where did they go?

37
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,520
Take me there now.

38
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,600
What's the rush?

39
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,400
What could happen
to the mighty Chief Eunuch?

40
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,240
He can handle whatever comes his way.

41
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,760
Speaking of which,

42
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,680
you look pretty nervous.

43
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,680
Are you worried about him?

44
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,320
I'm just being filial and nothing else.

45
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,440
Yes, you're right.

46
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,400
If you're not going, I'm going.

47
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,000
Go ahead.

48
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,800
All right, go.

49
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,160
You're awake.

50
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,600
It's you?

51
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,400
Are you mad?

52
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,280
Untie me now.

53
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,920
Do you know

54
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,480
when I started

55
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,320
to fall in love with you?

56
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,960
(What princess?)

57
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,720
(She's just a replacement picked up
by Duke of Defender.)

58
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,080
(Setting a marriage in a foreign land
is already showing her respect.)

59
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,200
(You're right.)

60
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,560
(A fake will always be a fake.
Yet, she's still choosy and picky.)

61
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,640
(Who is spreading gossip?)

62
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,400
(If I hear you speak ill
of the princess again,)

63
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,440
(I'll rip your tongues off.)

64

♪In the dead of night,

65
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,920

in the palace,)

66
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:38,520
(everyone treats me as a joke.)

67
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,600
(Only you, Murong Cang,)

68
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:46,680
(are different from those insincere men
who see me as a pawn.)

69
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,720
(You're the only one
who treats me equally.)

70
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,840
(Since then,)

71
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,320
(my heart belongs to you.)

72
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,600
(Even if you were a eunuch,)

73
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,800
(even if I knew it was just a delusion,)

74
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,560
(I willingly accept it.)

75
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,280
All my life,

76
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,320
I could have anything I wanted.

77
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,160
But you're the only one

78
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,800
I couldn't impress no matter what I do.

79
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,400
Now,

80
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,200
I'm about to become Empress.

81
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,640
But without you,

82
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,480
what's the point

83
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,520
even if I attain this position?

84
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,520
How did you...

85
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,840
Your petty tricks

86
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,840
can't hold me down at all.

87
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,080
I only gave you the chance
to vent your frustrations.

88
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,520
The imperial wedding is approaching.

89
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,800
You should stop your mischief here.

90
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,760
I won't pursue this incident this time.

91
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,680
Murong Cang, if you walk out of here,
I'll end my life right away.

92
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,720
Actually,

93
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,840
I only want to fulfill a wish.

94
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,720
I want to marry you.

95
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,920
There's no one else here.

96
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:28,200
I won't tell anyone about this.

97
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,960
I don't seek any future with you.

98
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,280
Can I?

99
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:38,680
No, you can't.

100
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,760
You're so heartless.

101
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,040
Aren't you afraid
I might really die here

102
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,120
and my father wants to bury you with me?

103
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,200
I would never die with you.

104
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,840
Who do you think you are?

105
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,320
Princess

106
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,640
sounds nice.

107
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,480
But you're just a pawn.

108
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,200
If you die in the palace today

109
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,560
and ruin Duke of Defender's plans,

110
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:12,800
can you handle his wrath?

111
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,720
You want me to die with you?

112
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,240
Foolish talk.

113
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,920
Chief Eunuch, you truly understand

114
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,200
the hearts and minds of other people.

115
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,840
I've said so many things.

116
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,240
Yet, you never mentioned
my feelings for you.

117
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,800
Murong Cang,

118
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,360
I really love you.

119
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,160
Love

120
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,520
is the most useless thing

121
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,160
in this world.

122
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,880
Your heartlessness

123
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,600
makes it impossible

124
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,480
for me to give up on you.

125
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,400
Even if I have to die today,

126
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,040
I'm completing
this wedding night with you!

127
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,240
What are you doing?

128
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,360
What's the matter?

129
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,400
Does putting out the candles

130
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,080
please you more, Chief Eunuch?

131
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,160
Stop it!

132
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,960
(You scoundrels!
I'll fight you to the death!)

133
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,360
(Please spare my son.)

134
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,800
So you like the darkness, Chief Eunuch.

135
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,680
(We'll come after you
even if we've turned into ghosts!)

136
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,720
Oh, Murong. Murong, where are you?

137
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,280
Chief Eunuch.

138
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,920
Chief Eunuch, where are you?

139
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,720
What's going on? I can't see you.

140
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,120
Murong, where are you?

141
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,160
Why can't I see you?

142
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,520
I can't see you. Where are you?

143
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:27,920
Chief Eunuch.

144
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,560
Chief Eunuch. So you're here.

145
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,560
Why are you covered in sweat?

146
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,920
Is it because you're too angry?

147
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,320
Let me help you vent your anger.

148
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,680
Why?

149
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,960
Do you want to kill me?

150
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,120
I'm willing

151
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,880
to die by your hands.

152
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:04,960
Murong Cang.

153
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,840
If you don't kill me today,

154
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,320
I'll make you beg me

155
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,000
on your knees in the future.

156
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,000
I want you to live as mine

157
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,640
and die as my ghost!

158
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:18,800
Stop it!

159
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,320
Chief Eunuch!

160
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,200
A woman?

161
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,600
You're actually a woman!

162
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,800
Murong Cang.

163
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,640
At first, I thought

164
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,040
you only favored

165
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,400
this delicate little eunuch.

166
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,480
I didn't expect

167
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,280
you hide such a beauty!

168
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:37,720
Listen.

169
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,280
I will personally destroy

170
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,040
what I can't have.

171
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,080
Chief Eunuch has ordered

172
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,760
to ensure Jixiang's safety.

173
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,200
Ensure Jixiang's safety, huh?

174
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,520
I won't kill you.

175
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,040
Right, Murong Cang?

176
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,120
Such a cute little thing,

177
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,720
I like it a lot.

178
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,480
It's just a shame.

179
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,400
The powder he applied for you
still remains.

180
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,440
Your Highness!

181
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,600
Little things,

182
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,920
I'll be waiting for you to come to me.
