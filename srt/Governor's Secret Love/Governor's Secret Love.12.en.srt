[Governor's Secret Love]
[Episode 12]

2
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,080
I'll take the second option.

3
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,240
You took less than a second to decide.

4
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,600
Why deny that you like Murong Cang?

5
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,000
I don't like him.

6
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,400
He's a man without sympathy.

7
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:05,160
But I gave him my words that I'd stay.

8
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,520
How strange.

9
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,640
You people never say what you mean.

10
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,160
I clearly said

11
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,800
I like him,

12
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,320
but I ended up being a pawn

13
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,280
and stuck with someone I don't like.

14
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,520
Your Highness.

15
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,560
What does "like" mean?

16
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,920
Like? Like is

Oh?

Did you two fight?

00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,040
- No.
- No.

Jixiang, you...

73
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,800
You're so ungrateful.

74
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,240
Last night, Chief Eunuch

75
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,200
carried you all the way back here

76
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,840
and kept you warm the whole night.

77
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:56,960
Kept me warm?

78
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,320
What did he do?

79
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,920
Well...

80
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,080
With the warm blanket.

81
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,800
Chief Eunuch, His Majesty summons you.

82
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,120
All right, I'll go get ready

83
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:16,920
and set off right away.

84
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,560
His Majesty wants you
to bring Miss Jixiang along.

85
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,520
Bring me along?

86
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,880
You're a woman.

87
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,520
I suppose Jixiang isn't your real name.

88
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:35,240
Yes, Your Majesty. My name is Yunjiao.

89
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,000
What's the relationship

90
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,240
between you and Yunjiao?

91
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,400
We must find

92
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,480
the lost Princess Xueqing

93
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,880
before the Duke of Defender
discovers it.

94
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,840
This is the only way

95
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,920
we can effectively restrain him.

96
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,400
Yes.

97
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,080
Yunjiao is a soothsayer

98
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,200
in the Longevity Shrine.

99
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,000
She saved my life before.

100
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,120
Out of gratitude,

101
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,720
I brought her into the palace.

102
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,720
(Gratitude, seriously?)

103
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,080
(You're supervising me.)

104
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,720
There are many ways
to express your gratitude, though.

105
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,680
Why should you keep her with you?

106
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,120
Exactly.

107
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,240
Chief Eunuch.

108
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,920
Could it be that you like Miss Yunjiao?

109
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:31,880
Please don't take me wrong.

110
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,000
I keep her with me

111
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,280
because I want to avoid others

112
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,480
threatening me with her.

113
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,040
If that's the case,

114
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,360
Miss Yunjiao can stay with me.

115
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,320
No, Your Majesty.

116
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,760
Yunjiao is a mere commoner.

117
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,400
She doesn't know
about the palace's rules.

118
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,000
It's fine.

119
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,760
At least I have a say in this place.

120
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,400
I was told that you knelt
in the snow last night.

121
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,120
It's my fault.

122
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,040
I'll send for the imperial physician

123
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,960
to give you some calming medicine.

124
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,640
Xueqing.

125
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,560
Xueqing!

126
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,240
Where is she?

127
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,600
She's in the room.

128
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:31,680
Out of my way.

129
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,520
General Hu, no!

130
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:36,480
Move aside.

131
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:40,840
I thought it was some crude man

132
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:43,440
yelling in the mansion
of the Duke of Defender.

133
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,400
Turns out, it's General Hu.

134
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,040
Why did you

135
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,160
release that eunuch

136
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,000
without asking for my permission?

137
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,840
General Hu, don't you think
you've overstepped the line?

138
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,240
Why do I need

139
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,600
your consent?

140
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,240
Ridiculous.

141
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,440
Ruddy Murong Cang

142
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:16,000
has found evidence
of my actions in the border town.

143
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,520
I know you're greedy.

144
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,440
How could you allow others to find
the evidence against you?

145
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,040
Yet you blame me

146
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:22,840
for your incompetence.

147
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,440
You...

148
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,840
Besides, I'm the princess.

149
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,000
I have the right to release anyone

150
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,840
or punish anyone.

151
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,200
Why? You want to lecture me
on behalf of my father?

152
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,040
Princess Xueqing.

153
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,480
You've gone too far.

154
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,040
I've gone too far?

155
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,280
General Hu.

156
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,720
I suppose you've already forgotten

157
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,280
how you became the general?

158
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,040
You're just my father's lackey.

159
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:00,880
You're right.

160
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:04,800
I'm a lackey of the Duke of Defender.

161
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,880
What are you, then?

162
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,400
You're merely a substitute

163
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,240
for your father.

164
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,040
How dare you!

165
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,560
I'm telling the truth.

166
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:17,920
Shut up.

167
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,400
Yes,

168
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,600
I'm a substitute.

169
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,240
My father went out of his way
to make me the empress.

170
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,600
Little does he know,

171
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:32,200
Murong Cang has already sent in a woman

172
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,600
to bear the emperor's first child

173
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,000
before I marry him.

174
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,040
What did you say?

175
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,840
Get this.

176
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,800
Eunuch Jixiang is a woman.

177
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,280
Murong Cang has placed a vixen

178
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,480
at the emperor's side

179
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,280
without my father knowing.

180
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,200
Well,

181
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,120
his plan

182
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,000
is going to fall through.

183
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,240
Your Majesty.

184
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:27,920
Yunjiao comes from a humble root

185
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:28,680
and she is uncouth.

186
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,200
I'm worried

187
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,360
that she might not be
a good companion for you.

188
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:33,960
Are you worried about her

189
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,480

190
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,800
You must be kidding.

191
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,120
How can a barely mature girl

192
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,840
be enough to catch your attention?

193
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,560
Barely mature girl?

194
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,560
It seems that you don't always
make sound judgments.

195
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,440

Ordinary?

219
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,760
(His taste turns worse
after being a eunuch for so long.)

220
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:16,440
(He has bad taste.)

221
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,920
If you have no interest in her,

222
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,280
I'll take her, then.

223
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,000
No.

224
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,480
She's merely a commoner.

225
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,800
How can she be your woman?

226
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,760
Whether she deserves it or not,

227
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,440
that's for me to decide.

228
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,480
Your Majesty.

229
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:37,400
General Hu is here.

230
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:45,960
Your Majesty.

231
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,720
I was told

232
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,840
that you refused
to name Princess Xueqing as the empress

233
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,680
because a vixen bewitched you.

234
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,480
What a convincing lie she has told.

235
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,880
Your Majesty,

236
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,600
you're a young emperor.

237
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,320
Please don't indulge in beauty.

238
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,760
I must kill the vixen

239
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,720
so as not to fail the trust
of the Duke of Defender.

240
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,880
General Hu, you've crossed the line.

241
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,120
His Majesty is the lord of this land.

242
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,200
We're in no place

243
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,360
to interfere
with the emperor's preference.

244
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,480
Princess Xueqing
hasn't become the empress yet.

245
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,600
Even if she does one day,

246
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,080
she should be virtuous enough
to accept other women.

247
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,240
(Why is he looking at me like that?)

248
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,320
(Is he going to kill me
in front of the emperor?)

249
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,160
(Why does she look
so much like the late empress?)

250
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,280
Did you present this woman

251
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,360
to His Majesty?

252
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,120
Who is she?

253
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,760
What's her identity?

254
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,200
It doesn't matter.

255
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,400
If you intend to interfere
with the palace's rules,

256
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,280
why don't you teach Princess Xueqing
how to behave

257
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,720
on behalf of the Duke of Defender?

258
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,920
If she enters the palace one day,

259
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,320
I'm afraid she might end up
in the cold palace.
