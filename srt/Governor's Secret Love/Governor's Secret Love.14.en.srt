General Hu.

193
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:30,640
You're showing much concern
about my story.

194
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,400
Don't tell me

195
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:38,320
you're trying to set up a date for me?

196
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,800
I refuse that.

197
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,280
I have someone I like.

198
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:53,120
Poor thing.

199
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,000
(Isn't she a soothsayer?)

200
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,040
(She can predict others' future)

201
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,120
(but never knows her own future.)

202
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,480
Miss Yunjiao.

203
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,080
I don't want

204
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,880
to be mean to you.

205
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,560
I hope

206
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,240
you can show me

207
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,280
your red birthmark.

208
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,440
You...

209
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,520
You're not young anymore.

210
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,440
How could you

211
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,480
be such a lewd?

212
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,120
Either you do it yourself,
or they make you do it.

213
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,840
None of them.

214
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:32,680
Go.

215
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,680
Help!

216
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,360
