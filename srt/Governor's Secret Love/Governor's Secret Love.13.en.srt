(His Majesty and General Hu
have already recognized her.)

8

00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,560
But what we can decide

91
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,400
is sincerity.

92
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,200
I've had bad luck since I was little.

93
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,920
I don't know
if it'll improve in the future.

94
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,440
So I've decided to follow

95
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,960
my true heart from now on.

96
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,440
Even if I fail and die,

97
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,760
I want to be a happy ghost.

98
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,480
Did I... Did I

99
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,800
show up at the wrong time?

100
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,600
Chief Eunuch, we just received a report.

101
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,440
Our spy at the Longevity Shrine
is about to be exposed.

102
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,600
We need to arrange evacuation
immediately.

103
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,000
Longevity Shrine?

104
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:11,920
What spy?

105
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,240
Did he blow his cover?

106
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,640
No.

107
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,000
But Duke of Defender's spy

108
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,320
showed up at Longevity Shrine.

109
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,600
I assume

110
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,200
they sensed something suspicious

111
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,560
after General Hu received
the account book.

112
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,400
I want you to set out now,

113
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,160
and cover the children's tracks
and help them leave the city.

114
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,720
Remember not to cause a big commotion.

115
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:47,400
Wait.

116
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,240
What are you talking about?

117
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,760
Where are you taking the children?

118
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,680
I want to go too.

119
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:55,440
No.

120
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,440
You must let me go.

121
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,800
Those children can be rowdy.

122
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,040
But they will listen to me.

123
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,640
It would be more useful sending me
instead of Fugui.

124
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:08,840
Fine.

125
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,160
Fugui.

126
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:10,560
Present.

127
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,720
Ensure the safety of everyone.

128
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:14,640
Yes, Chief Eunuch.

129
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:21,560
Chief Eunuch,

130
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,320
His Majesty requests your presence.

131
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,760
Chief Eunuch, I hope you're well.

132
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,240
Oh, it's you, General Hu.

133
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,320
Did His Majesty summon you?

134
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:37,040
I was planning to visit you
at your mansion.

135
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,160
I guess

136
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,840
you want me to play a matchmaker again

137
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,720
because you've set eyes
on one of my maids.

138
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,200
You're getting old.

139
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,680
You should take care of your health.

140
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,160
Murong Cang!

141
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,720
It's not that.

142
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,760
Official Hu, I'm not
in a good mood today.

143
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,680
I'm sure you know

144
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,320
I have a bad temper

145
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,840
as well as an intense murderous intent.

146
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,560
I only wanted to ask you something.

147
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,680
Where is that lass now?

148
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,960
Official Hu, I've said this earlier.

149
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,840
You're already quite old.

150
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,640
Are your wives not enough for you?

151
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,680
Murong Cang, stop feigning ignorance.

152
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,840
You know I'm talking about Yunjiao.

153
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,680
Could it be that my godson

154
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,360
had offended you?

155
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,280
I'll apologize on her behalf.

156
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,680
I naturally

157
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,440
have my reason to see her.

158
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,720
Chief Eunuch, are you getting in my way

159
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:40,000
because you're guilty of something?

160
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,600
I've done nothing against my conscience.

161
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:43,800
Why would I feel guilty?

162
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,120
Murong Cang, stop pretending already.

163
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,360
That lass looks exactly
like the late empress.

164
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,560
Seeing you hiding her so nervously

165
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,480
only makes me more suspicious
of your identity.

166
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,720
You have a point.

167
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,560
I have not been fortunate enough

168
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,240
to see the late empress myself.

169
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,000
I'm not sure

170
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,480
why you would associate a common girl

171
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,320
with the late empress?

172
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,840
Could it be that...

173
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,480
The late empress was the sister
of the Duke of Defender.

174
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:21,120
Is it something you and I
can casually comment on?

175
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,720
Official Hu, seeing you this agitated.

176
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,720
It seems Yunjiao's background

177
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,680
does have some incredible secrets.

178
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,360
I ought to look into this matter.

179
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:34,520
Murong Cang, it's fine
if you're unwilling to hand her over.

180
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,160
Why bother trying
to talk your way out of it

181
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,680
and muddle the issue?

182
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,840
