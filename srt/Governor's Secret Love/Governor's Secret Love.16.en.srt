[Episode 16]

2
00:00:59,000 --> 00:00:59,800
Fugui.

3
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,080
The first time,
you ended up in prison

4
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:03,880
for saving me.

5
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:06,920
Unexpectedly,

6
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:09,160
for the second time, it's me again.

7
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,880
You're not the reason.

8
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,920
General Hu and I have
been at each other's throats.

9
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:30,120
A war would erupt at any time,

10
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,520
and you put it ahead of time.

11
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,600
The one who should apologize

12
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:35,640
is me.

13
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,680
Fugui told me

14
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,000
he had a younger brother.

15
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,760
But they got separated
when they were little.

16
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,880
He hasn't found his brother yet.

17
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,040
Sadly, Fugui left

18
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,680
before they reunited.

19
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,200
Yes, he had a younger brother.

20
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,600
He got a mark on his nape

21
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,880
after a severe fever.

22
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,320
He disappeared

23
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,040
before Fugui entered the palace.

24
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,560
Chief Eunuch.

25
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,320
Take it.

26
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,200
Eat slowly.

27
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,560
It's been ages
since my stomach felt full.

28
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,840
I sold myself here

29
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,240
for some chump change

30
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,000
to buy medicine

31
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:48,560
for my brother.

32
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,520
Life is difficult.

33
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,680
Disasters are impending,

34
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,200
and bad guys

35
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,840
still prey on the people.

36
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:58,920
It's tough.

37
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,280
I think

38
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,720
I want to serve you

39
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,880
and live a dignified life.

40
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,120
Serving me?

41
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,040
Well,

42
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,800
I detest disloyal servants.

43
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,200
If you betray me

44
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:16,960
and turn to a new master...

45
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,640
You gave me this life, Chief Eunuch.

46
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,200
I'll repay it for you.

47
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,520
I was just kidding.

48
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,800
By the way, what's your surname?

49
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:28,720
Gou.

50
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:29,840
Gou?

51
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:30,600
Yes.

52
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,080
From now on,

53
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,560
you're Gou Fugui.

54
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,160
Gou Fugui?

55
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,320
It doesn't sound nice.

56
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,040
Really?

57
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:43,720
I won't forget you.

58
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,720
When I succeed one day,
[*The meaning of the name "Gou Fugui"]

59
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,520
I won't forget you.

60
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:55,960
Nine out of ten things in this world
leave us with regret.

61
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,920
Contentment rarely happens.

62
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,400
Since there are many regrets

63
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,960
in our lives,

64
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,360
can we avoid having this regret?

65
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:09,920
Yunjiao.

66
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,840
I'm a dangerous man.

67
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,920
No, you're a kind man.

68
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,720
You were kind back then,

69
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,040
and you still are.

70
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,040
Right, Mutou?

71
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,440
I told you I'm not.

72
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,000
Stop denying.

73
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,840
I don't know

74
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,240
why you refuse to tell me,

75
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,720
but I know you're him.

76
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,800
You're Mutou.

77
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,960
It's fine if you don't want
to talk about this.

78
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,760
I'll wait for the day
you tell me the truth.

79
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,440
Water is where we come from

80
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,120
and return to.

81
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,520
Fugui.

82
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,640
Follow along this stream.

83
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,840
It'll bring you back to your family.

84
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,880
I wish you prosperity

85
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,800
and longevity in your next life.

86
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,000
Fugui.

87
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,640
You gave me this.

88
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,960
Now, I'll return it to you.

89
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,800
(If these visions are true, then...)

90
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,200
(Is he really)

91
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,400
(going to end that way?)

92
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,800
What's wrong, Yunjiao?

93
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,680
Tomorrow,

94
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,120
I'll have someone send you away.

95
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,800
I... I don't want to go.

96
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,240
That's up to me.

97
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,320
Up to you?

98
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,320
Do you really think you're my father?

99
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,280
When I insisted on leaving,

100
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,320
you did everything to keep me.

101
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,080
Now, I've made friends,

102
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,600
considered this as home,

103
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,480
and have grown fond of everything here,

104
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,200
you intend to chase me out.

105
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,280
What do you take me for?

106
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,040
Chief Eunuch.

107
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,640
I shouldn't have brought you back

108
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,320
in the first place.

109
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,800
(You're right.
I've been waiting so long)

110
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,880
(for the boy who abandoned.)

111
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:20,680
(Even until now,)

112
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,600
(he refuses to admit it.)

113
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,200
You shouldn't have brought me back.

114
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,800
I tried so hard to find you.

115
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,000
Yet you anger me.

116
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,600

the relief funds.

132
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,520
I used to think embezzling in the palace
was the worst he could do.

133

He has no conscience at all.

134
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,840
Your Majesty, Fugui sacrificed his life

135
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,600
to bring the evidence back.

136
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,480
General Hu's evil doing

137
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:42,600
is sacrilegious.

138
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,040
We mustn't let him continue.

139
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,280
What are you trying to say, Murong?

140
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,680
I implore you to issue a warrant

141
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,480
against General Hu.

142
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,880
Knowing that the Duke of Defender
is returning in no time,

143
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,320
we might alert him

144
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,800
if we capture General Hu now.

145
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,400
Both of us have been
waiting in the wings,

146
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,040
I don't want this sudden move

147
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,600
to ruin the plan.

148
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,760
We didn't touch him,

149
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,680
because we're playing a long game.

150
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,640
We aimed to find
the duke's weak spot through him.

151
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,520
However, once the duke returns,

152
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,840
I'm afraid General Hu

153
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,280
will become more imperious.

154
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,200
By that time,

155
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,880
they probably will

156
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,160
distort the truth to retaliate.

157
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,800
General Hu knows

158
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,320
you won't take any action

159
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,400
when the duke is about to return.

160
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,800
His guard is down right at the moment.

161
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,080
Now

162
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,720
it's time to close the trap.

163
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:38,680
All right?

166

Murong, I'm aware of Fugui's death.

167
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,160
The capture of General Hu is at stake.

168
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,360
He's royalty, after all.

169
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,720

to bring him down.
