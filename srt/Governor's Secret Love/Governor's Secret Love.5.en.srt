[Governor's Secret Love]
[Episode 5]

2
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:34,440
You girl, what did you do to Chief Eunuch?

3
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,240
You actually replaced Ankang

4
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,000
and became the Lantern Keeper Eunuch.

5
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,360
You think I'm blessed
to replace a dead man?

6
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:47,440
You don't appreciate this?

7
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,240
Why? Do you intend
to take over my place?

8
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:52,720
You bet I am!

9
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,320
Little girl.

10
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,280
Stop.

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,920
Here, Godfather.

12
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:07,240
What a sycophant.

13
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,080
Murong Cang, help me! Murong Cang!

14
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:27,800
What's wrong?

15
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,440
Nothing.

16
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,040
Just warming your hands up.

17
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,760
How considerate.

18
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:38,720
Let's go.

19
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,480
Bootlicker.

20
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:42,400
Stop. Put me down.

21
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,040
Chief Eunuch, you come early
for the morning assembly.

22
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,920
Greetings, Princess Xueqing.

23
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,680
I'm thinking...

24
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,880
I'm going to seek an audience

25
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,000
with His Majesty.

26
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,480
If you will excuse me.

27
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:55,760
Let's go.

28
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,520
What a worthless thing.

29
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,160
Why do Murong Cang favor him so much?

30
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,280
He's merely a lackey.

31
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,960
Don't mind him, Your Highness.

32
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,440
He doesn't even deserve to be a lackey.

33
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,720
I shall see

34
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,040
if he can leave this palace alive.

35
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,120
(Judging from her clothes,)

36
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,360
(is Princess Xueqing the person
Chief Eunuch will rescue?)

37
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,360
Keep your eyes on the road.

38
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,520
Greetings, Your Majesty.

39
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,760
Sit.

40
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,680
Did you see Princess Xueqing outside
just now?

41
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,240
Yes.

42
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,320
The Duke of Defender hasn't returned.

43
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,080
And yet, they couldn't wait

44
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,360
to have General Hu send her in

45
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,200
and force me
to set a wedding date with her.

46
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,240
Princess Xueqing is willful

47
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,400
and abrupt.

48
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,960
She's not the right person
for your empress.

49
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,000
Are they not satisfied with
putting me under such scrutiny?

50
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,440
They even want to manipulate my harem.

51
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,000
To them,

52
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,320
I'm a puppet they use
to control the imperial court.

53
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,040
Please calm down.

54
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,960
You summoned me in today.

55
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,320
Have you come up with a plan?

56
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,320
Yes, I did have a plan.

57
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,480
However, I need your help.

58
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:30,200
Chief Eunuch favors you,

59
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,760
but that doesn't mean
you can act recklessly.

60
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,400
The deep bond
between Chief Eunuch and me

61
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,120
is way beyond you.

62
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,240
Eunuch Fugui.

63
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:45,080
You're the lofty principal eunuch.

64
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:48,400
I'm just a godson, right?

65
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,280
It's good that you can take a hint.

66
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,960
My goodness.

67
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,680
Why is my stomach in pain now?

68
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,600
Stay here.

69
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,600
I'll go to the loo.

70
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:00,880
Don't move a muscle.

71
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,720
Eunuch Jixiang.

72
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,800
Her Highness wants to see you.

73
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,280
Her Highness feels bad

74
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,640
as she accidentally hurt
the Chief Eunuch last time.

75
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,960
She invites you over

76
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:21,760
to inquire about his injuries.

77
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,880
(Princess Xueqing is of noble origin,
I can't afford to offend her.)

78
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,880
(I better not rub her the wrong way.)

79
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,080
(Probably, she would move on
from the conflict last time if I go.)

80
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,640
Kindly show me the way.

81
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,680
Please follow me.

82
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:40,080
I heard that Princess Xueqing
made a scene at the gate

83
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,960
just to meet you.

84
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:45,280
Your Majesty, I'm a eunuch.

85
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,440
Murong.

86
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:51,360
As long as Princess Xueqing
could break off the engagement,

87
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,680
a honey trap is
the smallest price you pay.

88
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,400
After all, you're not...

89
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,240
Your Majesty.

90
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,040
All right.

91
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,960
I was kidding you.

92
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,120
Hurry.

93
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,120
Keep up.

94
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,800
Hurry over there.

95
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,120
Greetings, Your Highness.

96
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,440
What took you so long?

97
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,520
Please calm down.

98
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:26,360
Eunuch Jixiang was giving me attitude.

99
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,440
I urge him many times.

100
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,680
Apparently, he shows you no respect.

101
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,680
I didn't.

102
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,760
Do you mean
that Nanny Li has wronged you?

103
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:43,560
My tea has gone cold
while waiting for you.

104
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,880
Have I wronged you as well?

105
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,000
I want hot tea.

106
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,520
Yes.

107
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,920
Your attitude is good.

108
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:15,040
I'll reward you with the tea.

109
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,520
What are you doing?

110
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,120
What are you up to?

111
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,640
We're going to serve you with the tea.

112
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,960
Useless fool.

113
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,000
Please calm down.

114
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,280
Your Highness.

115
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,560
I... I received orders
from the Chief Eunuch.

116
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,320
Without his permission,
I wouldn't dare leave my post.

117
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,400
How dare you threaten me
with Murong Cang.

118
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,120
You're in no place to serve him.

119
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,920
Please spare me.

120
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:00,200
I can give that some thought.

121
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,360
If you go down
and bring my hairpin back,

122
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:18,440
I'll let you off the hook today.

123
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,920
Your Highness, I can't swim.

124
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:22,880
If so,

125
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,440
woe to you,

126
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,720
but lucky me.

127
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,400
Come.

128
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,240
Bring him down there.

129
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,760
Your Highness.

130
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,480
Come on.

131
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,080
Your Highness.

132
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,480
I really can't swim.

133
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:36,960
Your Highness.

134
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:37,600
Push him down.

135
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:41,160
Your Highness, I can't swim!

136
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,920
Let go of me.

137
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,320
Move away.

138
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,480
Chief Eunuch.

139
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,560
We're heading back now.

140
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,440
Yes.

141
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:07,800
Where is Jixiang?

142
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,440
She was here just now

143
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,040
before I went to the loo.

144
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,360
I told you not to leave her.

145
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:15,680
I'm to blame.

146
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,640
You said you can't swim.

147
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,720
How dare you lie to me.

148
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,680
Your Highness, I can't find it.

149
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,920
Don't come up if you can't find it.

150
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:41,920
Murong Cang!

151
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,000
Help!

152
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,160
You lowly servant.

153
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,640
How dare you call his name.

154
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:47,600
I...

155
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:11,680
Your Highness.

156
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,560
Chief Eunuch is here.

157
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,120
Murong Cang.

158
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!

159
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,960
Save Her Highness!

160
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:26,880
Hurry up!

161
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:27,480
Help me!

162
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,200
Help!

163
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:28,880
Come on!

164
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:29,640
Save Her Highness!

165
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,320
Your Highness!

166
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,400
Murong Cang!

167
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,600
Stay still. Chief Eunuch will save me.

168
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,600
Your Highness.

169
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:36,280
Chief Eunuch.

170
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:36,800
Murong Cang.

171
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,560
Chief Eunuch, please save Her Highness.

172
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,200
Murong Cang.

173
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,920
Help me, Murong Cang!

174
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:40,920
Move away.

175
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:41,880
Save Her Highness!

176
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,200
Your Highness!

177
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,200
She falls into the water.

178
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,080
Help me!

179
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:44,880
Save Her Highness!

180
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,480
Murong Cang!

181
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,080
Murong Cang!

182
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,640
Chief Eunuch, save Her Highness!

183
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,840
Chief Eunuch!

184
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,080
Save Her Highness!

185
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,160
Chief Eunuch.

186
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,600
Your Highness.

187
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,200
Are you all right?

188
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,160
Your Highness.

189
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,080
Chief Eunuch, Your Highness.
Are you all right?

190
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,640
