00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,040
Not at all, General Hu.

138
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,740
You've been suppressed bandits
in the eastern suburbs for months.

139
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,160
However, I passed by there
on my way back,

140
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,480
I realized the banditry had acted up.

that Green Armored Guards
sealed the Longevity Shrine.

Official Murong,

150
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,760
you're injured.

151
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,000
You actually believe that, General Hu.

152
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,160
I purposely gave out the news

153
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:05,600
to lure the mole
that skulks in my mansion.

154
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,360
To my surprise, you're the first to ask.

155
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,560
General Hu.

00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,480

When the Duke of Defender returns,

158
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,400
I shall see if you still act this way.

159
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,040
Sure. I'll wait.

160
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,440
Make sure every corner is taken care of.

161
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,000
Careful.

162
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,560
Don't miss out on any candles.

163
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,000
If Chief Eunuch discovers it,

164
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,520
you might lose your head.

165
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,480
To the left a bit.

166
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,160
Why are you standing there?

167
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,000
Do your work.

168
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,440
Work it up.

169
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,000
What's so big deal about candles?

170
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,040
Why must he be so fastidious?

171
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,120
This isn't a trivial thing.

172
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,080
A single candle

173
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,440
can cost us our lives.

174
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,400
Are you trying to scare me?

175

Chief Eunuch, something happened
in the mansion.

185
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,200
Your Majesty, something came up.

186
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,080
I'll take my leave.

Your Majesty.

189
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,240
What?

190
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,840
Oh, my. Xueqing

191
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,040
went to see that eunuch again.

192
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,040
Your Highness, please have mercy.

193
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,400
Your Highness.

194
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,640
Lowly servant.

195
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,040
Who do you think you are
to block my way?

196
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,680
Beat him to death.

197
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,520
Chief Eunuch forbids

198
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,320
anyone to enter the inner chamber.

199
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,120
Your Highness.

200
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,040
Your Highness, please have mercy.

201
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,920
How dare you threaten me
with Murong Cang.

202
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,400
Now that he's not in the capital.

203
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,800
Even if he's right before you,

204
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,480
I can take your life effortlessly.

205
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,800
Hold up.

206
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,440
Your Highness.

207
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,120
Please show him some mercy.

208
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,280
He's merely a...

209
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:38,640
Oh.

210
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,160
He's merely a servant.

211
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,400
And you?

212
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,360
What are you?

213
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,760
I...

214
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:51,040
Chief Eunuch adopted me a few days ago.

215
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,160
What?

216
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,800
Murong Cang is back.

217
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:55,720
Yes.

218
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,120
I've been waiting for him these days.

219
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,880
Finally, he's back.

220
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:01,600
Please spare me, Your Highness.

221
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,440
Please spare me.

222
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,640
Chief Eunuch instructed me

223
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,400
not to let anyone
enter the inner chamber.

224
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,440
If anyone trespasses on it,
all servants will be punished.

225
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,360
(If I butt out,
Chief Eunuch will beat us.)

226
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,960
(If I butt in, she will beat us.)

227
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,240
(Forget it. We'll get beaten, anyway.)

228
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:17,760
Your Highness.

229
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,280
(Whatever.)

230
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,440
Your Highness.

231
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:20,920
You can't go in.

232
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:21,640
What are you doing?

233
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,400
Please don't go.

234
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,000
Lowly servant.

235
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:23,400
I won't let go.

236
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,160
Get off.

237
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:24,760
Get off.

238
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:25,480
Shut up.

239
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:29,040
Why make a big fuss here?

240
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,120
He's just a godson,

241
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,760
not his own son.

242
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,240
Just kill him.
