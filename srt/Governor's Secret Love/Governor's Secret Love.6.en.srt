[Episode 6]

2
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,160
Your Highness.

3
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,080
Are you all right?

4
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:36,760
I was worried sick.

5
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,600
Did you get hurt?

6
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,600
Dry yourself.

7
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,440
Your Highness.

8
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,520
What are you waiting for?

9
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:46,480
Are you all right?

10
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:48,440
Jixiang.

11
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:50,240
Jixiang.

12
00:00:57,230 --> 00:00:57,840
What's wrong?

13
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:02,640
My bracelet.

14
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:05,640
Don't worry.

15
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,440
I'll drain Yu Lake

16
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,480
to bring the bracelet back to you.

17
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,000
Keep yourself alive.

18
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,600
Don't lose your life outside
and embarrass me.

19
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,600
I won't pick up your body.

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,040
Yes.

21
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:29,840
Sod off!

22
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:30,360
Your Highness.

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,440
Murong Cang, I was in the water.

24
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,000
Why did you save him, not me?

25
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,800
Please forgive me.

26
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:47,760
Next time, I promise.

27
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,240
You...

28
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,600
Stop right there.

29
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,200
What's the matter, Chief Eunuch?

30
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,600
Fugui.

31
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,120
Yes.

32
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,280
Kneel and accept your punishment.

33
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,640
What have we done?

34
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:10,680
On your knees.

35
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,760
Nanny Qian.

36
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,440
You're involved in gambling activities,

37
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,840
and assembled a crowd to gamble.

38
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,080
Pang Guang.

39
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,440
Forgive me, Chief Eunuch.

40
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,160
Thank you, Chief Eunuch.

41
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,120
Fugui, keep a close eye
on Princess Xueqing and her servants

42
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,200
if they are involved
in illegal activities.

43
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,840
Understood?

44
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,360
Nanny Du.

45
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,080
You abducted

46
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,240
and harassed the guards.

47
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,920
And you.

48
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,240
[Charges]

49
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,320
Nanny Li.

50
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,400
You abused power, started gangs,

51
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,160
play favoritism, and disrupted unity.

52
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,680
How dare you servants

53
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,880
violate the palace rules.

54
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,200
I've been watching you for a long time.

55
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,520
Eunuch Fugui.

56
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,560
Eunuch Fugui, we're innocent.

57
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,280
- Innocent?
- We're innocent.

58
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,120
Are you saying that Chief Eunuch
blames you for nothing?

59
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,240
I... I dare not.

60
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,320
I've been serving Her Highness
all this while.

61
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,440
Please have mercy on me.

62
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,920
I won't dare again.

63
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,720
Your Highness.

64
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,720
Do you want to plead for them?

65
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,280
Me?

66
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,360
I'm sick of these servants.

67
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,640
Please handle this for me.

68
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,880
Your Highness, help me.

69
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,160
Stay away.

70
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,680
Get bent.

71
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,640
Silence.

72
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:54,200
Considering your long service
to Princess Xueqing,

73
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,320
you're exempted from whipping.

74
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,840
- Thank you, Chief Eunuch.
- Thank you, Chief Eunuch.

75
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:02,240
You will be shaved
and sent to Qingsi Monastery

76
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:03,880
to reflect on yourselves.

77
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:07,480
Shaved? How can I get married, then?

78
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,780
[Chief Eunuch's Mansion]

79
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,360
Godfather.

80
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:01,800
Are you satisfied with my service?

81
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,600
(The physician said I needed to sweat
to ward off the cold.)

82
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,920
(Sod him.)

83
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,160
(Instead of giving me
a bowl of ginger soup,)

84
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,720
(he actually wants me to wipe his back.)

85
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,920
(Fake eunuch.)

86
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,200
(Keep your distance from women,
you know?)

87
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,080
What's wrong?

88
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,800
Nothing.

89
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,240
Just warming your hands up.

90
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,360
Are you sweating?

91
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,280
Yes.

92
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,160
I sweat a lot.

93
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,360
I'm sweating like a pig.

94
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,120
Thank you, Godfather.

95
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,640
You said

96
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,280
you could foresee the future,
didn't you?

97
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,000
Then why didn't you

98
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,360
foresee today?

99
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,080
Or

100
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,920
did you hide it

101
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,720
from me?

102
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:09,360
God.. Godfather, that's not true.

103
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,840
My prophecy isn't always accurate.

104
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,640
Sometimes, there are things
I don't know.

105
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,520
Including

106
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,640
that I would fall in love with you?

107
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,080
I saw

108
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,560
that you would fall deeply for me.

109
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,280
And you love me

110
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,880
in spite of yourself.

111
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,160
Nonsense!

112
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,960
Forgive me, there is something else.

113
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:49,800
I...

114
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,720

What did you see?

I'll tell you now.

00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:57,360
Actually, my prophecy is accurate.

128
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,960
The thing is,

129
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,080
every time

130
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,560
when I see visions

131
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,440
about you,

132
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,920
they are unusual.

133
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:15,120
I saw rain, snow,

134
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:19,280
and someone's heartbreaking cry.

135
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,160
What else?

136
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,440
And...

137
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:23,800
Fire away.

138
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,720
And

139
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,400
you will die for me.

140
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,080
I'll die for you?

141
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,120
I'll kill you now,

142
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,840
and your prophecy will be broken.

143
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,880
No.

144
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:51,640
It's not always that accurate.

145
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,720
It fails sometimes.

146
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,920
I'm influential in the imperial court

147
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,360
and I have made a lot of enemies.

148
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,000
If

149
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,680
I know

150
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,200
that I would fall for someone,

151
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,800
do you know

152
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,320
what I will do?

153
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,840
General Hu seeks an audience
with His Majesty just now.

154
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,800
His Majesty summons you

155
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,040
to the inner hall immediately.

156
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,120
Greetings, Your Majesty.

157
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,880
You're indeed attractive,
Official Murong.

158
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:59,040
No wonder Princess Xueqing
takes a liking to you.

159
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,240
What do you mean, General Hu?

160
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:05,200
Princess Xueqing
has a row with your godson

161
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:08,000
because of you.

162
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,120
She swore not to marry anyone
except for you after returning home.

163
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,400
General Hu was so anxious about this.

164
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,440
There's no need for that, General Hu.

165
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,080
I'm a eunuch.

166
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,800
I can't marry a woman.

167
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,160
It doesn't matter.

168
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,920
The only thing that matters now
is to put that vow out of her head.

169
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,240
If Duke of Defender realizes this
when he returns,

170
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,480
I'm afraid that no one can save you

171
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
from his killing intention.

172
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:39,240
I see. So you came here tonight

173
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,880
to save my life?

174
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,440
Why do I care about you?

175
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:50,240
I care for the future of our country.

176
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,200
Princess Xueqing is of noble origin.

177
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,480
She's the most suitable candidate
to bear the royal heir.

178
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,160
Your Majesty,
please consider this seriously.

179
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,040
Naming the empress

180
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,040
isn't child's play.

181
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,560
They forced me to marry Princess Xueqing

182
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,560
even after the farce she had caused.

183
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,560
They are wary of you.

184
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,600
So they determined to make
Princess Xueqing the empress.

185
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,120
If she gives birth to a trueborn,

186
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,280
a newborn baby

187
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,360
is way easier to manipulate
than the adult emperor.

188
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,720
Not in a million years.

189
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,240
For my mother's death

190
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,160
and the sacrifice of
your aggrieved family,

191
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,760
they will pay blood

192
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,040
for blood.

193
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,760
Oh, no. Crap.

194
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,640
He's going to kill me.

195
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,280
I shouldn't have told him.

196
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,480
This is my last hope.

197
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,240
I'm counting on you.

198
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,360
Spring breeze in warm air

199
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,520
spells a great fortune.

200
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:44,920
Great fortune!

201
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,280
I think I might leave this place today.

202
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,760
Wonder how my dullard boy is doing now.

203
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,880
You called this a fine day?

204
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,440
It turns out I'm really a charlatan.

205
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:16,280
Chief Eunuch has returned.

206
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,720
I better slip off now.

207
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:41,760
Chief Eunuch.

208
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,440
You may go.

209
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,480
I want to be alone now.

210
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:46,920
Yes.

211
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,400
You may go.

212
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:49,800
- Yes.
- Yes.

213
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,400
(Great!)

214
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,880
(I can go back
to the Longevity Shrine now.)

215
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:26,280
Jixiang, serve the tea.

216
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:31,600
Jixiang.
