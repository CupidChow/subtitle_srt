[Governor's Secret Love]
[Episode 15]

2
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:36,880
Either you do it yourself,
or I make them do it.

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,320
None of them.

4
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:40,360
Go.

5
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:43,840
Help!

6
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:44,880
Stop!

7
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,520
Fugui!

8
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,040
Fugui!

9
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,560
General Hu, did you forget this?

10
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,160
Chief Eunuch said

11
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,000
no one is allowed

12
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,280
to lay a finger on his servants
except for himself.

13
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,120
What a surprise.

14
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,960
I keep my movements in the dark,

15
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,480
but you found this out.

16
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,600
Chief Eunuch

17
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,720
is a resourceful man.

18
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,720
General Hu, since you know this,

19
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,400
it's not too late to stop now.

20
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,320
She's important to me.

21
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,600
If he wants her back,

22
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,120
he should come here himself.

23
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,560
Chief Eunuch

24
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:12,120
will let you off the hook

25
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,320
as if it never happened

26
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,040
if you return her.

27
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:19,960
What if I say no?

28
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,800
There'll be no turning back
for you, then.

29
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,840
How dare you!

30
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,960
You're merely a lackey for Murong Cang.

31
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,400
Who are you to threaten me?

32
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,080
Yes, I'm a servant

33
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,840
who takes advantage of Chief Eunuch

34
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,960
to seek your concession.

35
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,520
If Jixiang

36
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,040
has offended you,

37
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,760
Chief Eunuch

38
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,440
will apologize to you in person.

39
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,960
You seem to be more polite

40
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,920
than your master.

41
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,400
Well, that doesn't really matter now.

42
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,960
Chief Eunuch is waiting for Jixiang.

43
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,880
Murong Cang is here?

44
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:06,960
(If he were here,)

45
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,000
(Fugui wouldn't have to come in alone.)

46
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,680
(But he hasn't taken
any action so far...)

47
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,400
Murong Cang, don't mind me!

48
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,280
Release the arrow!

49
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,760
Let's go.

50
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,120
Shield! Protect me!

51
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,640
Go after them!

52
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,440
Go!

53
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,400
Go!

54
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:34,920
Let's go.

55
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:35,960
Listen.

56
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,480
Don't ever get me involved next time.

57
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,800
This is so scary.

58
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,360
Where's Murong Cang?

59
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,600
Chief Eunuch?

60
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,840
I haven't had a chance to inform him.

61
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,080
Didn't he send you here?

62
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,000
He doesn't even know about this.

63
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,520
You're ungrateful.

64
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,160
How many people did you bring?

65
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,560
Just me.

66
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,960
Mount.

67
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,400
Stay still.

68
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,320
Watch out.

69
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,960
How bold of you.

70
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,160
You actually came here alone.

71
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,960
We've never been

72
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,920
cowards.

73
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,240
If you don't believe this,

74
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,880
try me.

75
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,640
Fugui.

76
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,400
They outnumber us.

77
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,360
The petition values more than my life.

78
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,040
You must hand it over to Chief Eunuch.

79
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,160
I know. We'll run immediately

80
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,280
after the cue.

81
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,320
Yes.

82
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,600
Three,

83
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,760
two,

84
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,400
one.

85
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,640
Go.

86
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,080
Gallop!

87
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:53,760
Fugui!

88
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,560
Don't come back!

89
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,800
Stop!

90
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,640
Fugui!

91
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,120
Why?

92
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,680
Do you stay to meet your demise?

93
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,280
Servants of Chief Eunuch

94
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,320
are brave warriors.

Charge!

- Kill him!

Please take care of Chief Eunuch
on my behalf.

Fugui!

101
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,640
Stop gawking.

102
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,960
Why? Do you plan to take over my place?

103
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,400
You bet I do.

104
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:15,920
I'm alive.

105

[Chief Eunuch's Mansion]
Chief Eunuch!

106
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,800
Jixiang is back.

107
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:48,760
Jixiang.

108
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,320
Chief Eunuch.

109
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,240
Are you all right, Jixiang?

110
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:56,920
Jixiang.

111
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:01,090
Chief Eunuch.

112
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,440
This...

113
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,320
Fugui asked me to give you this.

114
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,320
He said

115
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,680
this values more than his own life.

116
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,360
Where's Fugui?

117
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:23,240
General Hu besieged
the Longevity Shrine.

118
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,560
Fugui

119
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,800
is dead.

120
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,880
Sir, I don't think this is appropriate.

121
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,200
That brat must've told Murong Cang

122
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,200
everything.

123
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,080
Do you think Murong Cang
will let me off the hook?

124
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,360
Will Chief Eunuch...

125
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,360
What?

126
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,400
Does he have any evidence against me?

127
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,840
Instead of sitting by and doing nothing,

128
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:16,920
I'd rather make the first move.

129
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:17,960
Yes.

130
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:20,920
Sir, look.

131
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,000
General Hu.

132
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,720
Leave the body of Eunuch Fugui here.

133
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,040
I'll let you pass.

134
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,920
Isn't it suspicious

135
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,440
if you bring back your fellow

136
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,200
who has committed a crime?

137
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,040
Let's go.

138
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,040
You determine to stop me?

139
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,000
Hyah!

140
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:40,840
Hyah!

141
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,360
Inside this coffin

142
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,680
will be either Fugui

143
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,200
or

144
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,680
you, General Hu.

145
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,880
Make your choice.

146
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,080
Your henchman attempted
to assassinate me,

147
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,880
and yet you defend him publicly.

148
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,880
Did you send him last night instead?

149
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,800
If I intend to kill you,

150
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,120
do you think

151
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,160
you can challenge me here in one piece?

152
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,200
Chief Eunuch,
since you decide to use force,

153
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,640
I suppose I have to face it, then.

154
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:51,440
However, I hope

155
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,200
you can be impartial

156
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,240
and don't make it personal.

157
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,640
Kindly don't hold grudges against me.

158
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,240
Let's go.

159
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,400
Jixiang.

160
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,640
Chief Eunuch, you mustn't

161
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,480
blame the innocent unfairly

162
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,560
and bring disaster to the country

163
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,840
because of the vixen's rumors.

164
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,440
