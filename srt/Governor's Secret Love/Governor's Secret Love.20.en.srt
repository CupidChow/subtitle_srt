[Governor's Secret Love]
[Episode 20]

2
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,900
[Duke of Defender's Mansion]

3
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:40,000
Your Highness, why did you tell me

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:40,960
about my identity

5
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,880
instead of just killing me?

6
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,400
Aren't you afraid
I might take it away from you?

7
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,480
If I were to kill you,

8
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,120
Murong Cang would hate me forever

9
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,040
and remember you
for the rest of his life.

10
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:54,960
I wouldn't want that.

11
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,440
Your Highness.

12
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,280
We can't be friends,

13
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,440
however,

14
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,480
I have a favor to ask of you.

15
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,000
Get up first.

16
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,240
Get up.

17
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,600
I'm so fed up with you people.

18
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,120
How insincere.

19
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,440
Anyway,

20
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,960
if I do you this favor,

21
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,440
will you stop liking

22
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,040
Murong Cang?

23
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,160
Can I have him?

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,120
I told you

25
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,760
he knew about your identity
a long time ago.

26
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,160
He has been lying to you.

27
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,360
It's time to wake up.

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,400
He did nothing wrong.

29
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,320
And he didn't lie to me.

30
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,960
It's just that we're deceived
by the fate

31
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,200
and by ourselves.

32
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,600
Deceived by ourselves?

33
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,400
Yes.

34
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,120
I've been deceiving myself.

35
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:04,680
I deceived myself into thinking
I'm Father's daughter,

36
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,240
and he loves me.

37
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,480
Your Highness.

38
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,400
Does your father mistreat you?

39
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,520
He adopted me.

40
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,040
I never have to worry about my life.

41
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,280
However,

42
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,680
no one has ever truly cared for me.

43
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,160
That year,

44
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,440
when I was conferred as a princess,

45
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,840
he gave me two choices.

46
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,400
First, the marriage alliance.

47
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,000
Second,

48
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,720
to become the empress.

49
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,480
I chose the latter.

50
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,720
This is the only way

51
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,800
I can stay beside someone I love.

52
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,440
Right?

53
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,680
Actually, I never understood

54
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,640
why you liked Murong Cang.

55
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,240
I'm not sure.

56
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,120
Unlike others, he treats me differently.

57
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,160
You know what?

58
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,600
I've always feared

59
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,520
what would happen to me

60
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,320
if the real Princess Xueqing showed up.

61
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,320
The more I'm afraid,

62
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,040
the more I become imperious.

63
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,960
However, I suffer more

64
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,120
while I'm at it.

65
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,720
Now that you appear,

66
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,120
I feel somewhat relieved.

67
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,160
At least

68
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,920
you're predictable,

69
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,640
and you don't covet my position.

70
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:47,880
Am I right?

71
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,080
Your Highness.

72
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,800
I want to meet the Duke of Defender.

73
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:57,960
Hey.

74
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,800
Do you really think I won't kill you?

75
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,560
You refuse to let me

76
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,680
have Murong Cang, fine.

77
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,240
But now you want to take away my father

78
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,560
and chase me out.

79
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,840
No, it's not it.

80
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,320
I know you'll think this is unfair.

81
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,920
But if

82
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,040
I'm really a pawn

83
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,040
like what you said,

84
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,880
I hope

85
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,040
I'm the one to make the move.

86
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:24,920
If so...

87
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,640
Which side will you choose,

88
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,160
the Duke of Defender

89
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,360
or Murong Cang?

90
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,480
(Yunjiao, the daughter
of the Duke of Defender)

91
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,160
(is conferred as Princess Guyu.)

92
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,240
Come with me.

93
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:38,880
This is the chamber

94
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,600
you used to live in.

95
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,520
I have had someone watching it
over these years.

96
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,720
No one has been allowed in.

97
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,920
Look around.

98
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:48,720
(Why?)

99
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,080
(Why do I feel familiar)

100
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,320
(with everything here?)

101
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,720
(By any chance,)

102
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,520
(this man is truly kind to me?)

103
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,360
Do you still remember this place?

104
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,160
I don't.

105
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,480
It's fine.

106
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,680
You may stay here.

107
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,240
The memories

108
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,000
will come back to you over time.

109
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,920
(So this is her room.)

110
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,080
(I wanted to come in here
when I was little.)

111
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,240
(And Father beat me because of this.)

112
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,480
Xueqing.

113
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,640
Come in.

114
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,880
Go to the hall.

115
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,200
I have something to talk to you.

116
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,400
Yes.

117
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:47,880
Father.

118
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,040
Qing.

119
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,560
Let's go in

120
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,920
and look around.

121
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:53,680
Come.

122
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,320
Father.

123
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,440
Don't call me Father.

124
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,480
What have you done

125
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,840
while I was away?

126
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,360
Calm down, Father.

127
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,600
I'm incompetent.

128
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,360
No.

129
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,520
Because you're out of your mind

130
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,880
whenever you see Murong Cang.

131
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,560
You've completely forgotten

132
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,080
everything I told you.

133
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,240
In that case,

134
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,840
why do I need you?

135
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,080
Father.

136
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,640
I found Yunjiao for you.

137
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,040
Please let me stay.

138
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,200
Please.

139
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,840
If you behave well

140
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,680
after Yunjiao moves in here,

141
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,760
I won't mistreat you.

142
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,680
From now on,
Yunjiao is your younger sister.

143
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,520
Be kind to her.

144
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,320
Understood?

145
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:54,840
Yes.

146
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:00,400
(Father, I've been trying so hard.)

147
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,160
(Why don't you appreciate me?)

148
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,200
(You haven't met Yunjiao for years,)

149
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,440
(and yet you still hold her dearly.)

150
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:25,480
Chief Eunuch.

151
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,840
There's a letter at the entrance.

152
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,600
It seems like it's from Jixiang.

153
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,280
Bring it to me.

154
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,160
Where's the person who delivered this?

155
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,280
The person has left.

156
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,520
You may leave.

157
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,400
Yes.

158
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:11,200
[Duke of Defender's Mansion]

159
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:16,520
(I wonder how Murong Cang is now.)

160
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,840
(If I had told him in advance,)

161
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,760
(he wouldn't have agreed.)

162
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,160
(But if I didn't acknowledge
the Duke there,)

163
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,360
(he wouldn't believe me.)

164
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,480
(So my next step is)

165
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,920
(to find the weak spot of the Duke.)

166
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,000
(That way, I can help Murong Cang.)

167
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,080
It's me.

168
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,240
What brings you here?

169
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,640
That's my question.

170
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,840
What are you doing here?

171
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:12,840
Let's go back.

172
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:15,680
Go back?

173
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,120
You knew everything?

174
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,520
I do.

175
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,680
So now come back with me.

176
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,800
I'll tell you everything.

177
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,480
Why didn't you use me?

178
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,320
I can handle my own revenge

179
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,680
just well.

180
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,360
But I can be your sword.

181
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,640
Who do you think you are?

182
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,720
You even failed your task

183
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,200
as a servant.

184
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,760
You don't serve any value for me.

185
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,680
Who do you think you are, huh?

186
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,880
I've come home.

187
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:15,320
Where can I go after I follow you?

188
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,080
If you choose to stay here today,

189
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,120
from now on,

190
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,680
we'll be enemies.

191
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,040
Fine.

192
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,440
