[Governor's Secret Love]
[Episode 22]

2
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:44,800
I understand.

3
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,280
If you're not willing
to make the decision,

4
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,840
then I'll take over.

5
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,040
Forgive me

6
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,240
for speaking out of turn.

7
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,920
If there's nothing else,

8
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,560
you can leave.

9
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:00,280
Your Majesty,

10
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:02,680
I have a request.

11
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:03,800
Speak.

12
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:06,800
Please issue a decree.

13
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,520
Let me go to the border
to take away the Duke's military power.

14
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:11,960
I forbid it.

15
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,360
I don't want to repeat myself.

16
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,200
Please hear me out, Your Majesty.

17
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,280
I have two requests.

18
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:19,320
First.

19
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,840
If I die,

20
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,120
please don't direct your anger
at Yunjiao.

21
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,240
Let her stay
at the Duke of Defender's Mansion.

22
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:28,640
Second.

23
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,200
If I complete the mission
and return alive,

24
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:34,400
I ask Your Majesty
to allow Yunjiao to leave the capital

25
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,640
and live freely.

26
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,640
Why should I agree to your requests?

27
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:42,040
Based on the pact
between us in the past.

28
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,200
Your Majesty will grant me power

29
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,080
and help me rise in the ranks.

30
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,800
In return, I'll help Your Majesty
investigate cases to seek revenge

31
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,120
and assist in bringing peace
to the country.

32
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,160
Are you trying to strike a deal with me?

33
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,800
I dare not.

34
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,720
But Your Majesty, I need

35
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,320
a blade to cut through the obstacles.

36
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,240
I am willing

37
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,880
to be Your Majesty's blade.

38
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,560
If I agree,

39
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,200
what if you try

40
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,800
to climb onto my head

41
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,120
someday?

42
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,440
I shall hang the blade

43
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:39,680
and perish.

44
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,760
I hope you remember that.

45
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,080
Yes, Your Majesty.

46
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,480
(From today onward,)

47
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,920
(I grant you the same privileges
as the Duke of Defender.)

48
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,600
(You may carry a weapon to court)

49
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,280
(and are excused from kneeling
in my presence.)

50
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,320
(This will make
the officials fear you more.)

51
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:57,040
(Your investigations
should proceed smoothly after that.)

52
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,120
(Thank you, Your Majesty.)

53
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,560
I shall consider your silence

54
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,800
as your permission.

55
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,280
I'm grateful
for Your Majesty's benevolence.

56
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,180
[Longevity Shrine]

57
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,000
Your Majesty,

58
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,560
what are you doing?

59
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,800
Where is Murong Cang?

60
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,440
I heard

61
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,440
you have evidence
against the Duke of Defender.

62
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,080
So I came here

63
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,960
to ask you for it.

64
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,400
Where's Murong Cang?

65
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,080
I won't give it to anyone else
except him.

66
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:19,400
Yunjiao,

67
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,520
you'll never see Murong Cang anymore.

68
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,280
You're the daughter of his enemy.

69
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,760
Do you think both of you
have a future together?

70
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,360
I don't understand what you mean.

71
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,120
Why are you doing this?

72
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,440
The Duke of Defender

73
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,240
will never admit
even if there's evidence.

74
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,240
You're his only weakness.

75
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,240
Take her away.

76
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,760
Murong Cang.

77
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:03,760
Murong Cang.

78
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,560
It's my decision

79
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,800
to go to the border.

80
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,560
It's my personal matter.

81
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,560
You don't have to follow me.

82
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,160
These are silvers stored

83
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,520
in my mansion.

84
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,880
If you don't mind,

85
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:35,920
you can distribute them
among yourselves.

86
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,720
From now on,

87
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,880
I, Murong Cang,

88
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,600
is no longer the Chief Eunuch.

89
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,560
So all of you

90
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,360
may go your separate ways.

91
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,080
It's a big world out there.

92
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,200
I wish all of you well.

93
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,480
We vow to follow Chief Eunuch Murong
until death.

94
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,680
We vow to follow Chief Eunuch Murong
until death.

95
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,880
We vow to follow Chief Eunuch Murong
until death.

96
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,960
We vow to follow Chief Eunuch Murong
until death.

97
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,080
We vow to follow Chief Eunuch Murong
until death.

98
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,040
Good!

99
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,200
Set out!

100
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,360
Yes, sir.

101
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:02,720
Tell me

102
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,480
where you hide those letters!

103
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:05,960
What is the content of the letters?

104
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,800
Where's Murong Cang?

105
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:14,200
I won't give the evidence to anyone,
but him.

106
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,160
You want to know where he is?

107
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,200
He won't see you.

108
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,760
He wishes to kill you a great deal.

109
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,880
Why would he want to see you?

110
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,040
You're lying.

111
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,880
What did you do to him?

112
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,160
Don't you realize who you are?

113
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,160
Duke of Defender and Murong Cang
have a deep-seated blood feud.

114
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,240
How could he possibly like you?

115
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,200
Tell me!

116
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,680
Where are the letters?

117
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,400
Speak!

118
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,040
Speak!

119
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,480
Speak!

120
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:43,720
Speak!

121
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,320
Stop it!

122
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,360
You, scoundrel!

123
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:48,600
Get lost!

124
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:49,800
Yes, Your Grace.

125
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:54,960
Murong Cang.

126
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:55,800
Jiao,

127
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,520
I'm your father.

128
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,000
I'm getting you out of here.

129
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,320
Stop!

130
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,040
Duke of Defender?

131
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,200
Are you breaking her out of here?

132
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,000
Your Majesty,
your words carry great weight.

133
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,440
I dare not do such a thing.

134
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,120
Then what brings you here?

135
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,960
I wonder what crime
did this young lady commit.

136
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,760
How could a frail young lady

137
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,040
endure

138
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,480
such cruel torture?

139
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,440
If she is at fault,

140
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,080
I'm willing to bear the punishment

141
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,000
for the young lady.

142
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,120
Princess Guyu discovered various letters

143
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,840
between you and the late emperor,

144
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,000
detailing the events

145
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,280
of how you and the Duke of Hu conspired

146
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,760
to replace the heir,

147
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,560
plotted against
the late emperor's consort,

148
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,920
falsely accused
Imperial Physician Mu Yinyuan,

149
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,560
and massacred the Mu family.

150
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,400
But she's hiding

151
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,720
the evidence.

152
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,040
She refuses to hand the evidence over.

153
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,320
Duke of Defender,

154
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,880
how should I punish her?

155
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,720
Or how should I punish you?

156
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,320
Your Majesty,
don't let malicious rumors mislead you.

157
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,640
The young lady is innocent, and so am I.

158
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,640
I hope you allow me

159
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:19,160
to take the young lady back
for treatment.

160
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,240
Stop!

161
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:28,960
Your Majesty,

162
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,640
it seems you intend

163
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,280
to settle the score with me today.

164
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,240
Duke of Defender,
choose your words wisely.

165
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,680
Give it to me.

166
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,000
Give it back to me.

167
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,000
Duke of Defender,

168
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,720
why don't you come
and see it for yourself?

169
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,480
Or I will throw these

170
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,120
into the brazier.

171
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,520
You've kept them for so many years.

172
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,680
I'm sure it breaks your heart

173
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,720
to watch

174
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,040
my mother's handwriting being burned.

175
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,520
Your Majesty, stop!

176
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,760
Your Majesty, please stop.

177
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,440
Please stop.

178
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,240
I ask that Your Majesty

179
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,920
stop torturing this young lady.

180
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:38,720
All right.

181
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,640
Your Majesty,

182
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,680
you've grown up.

183
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,280
You've indeed grown up now.

184
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,840
Well, it's not that I've grown up.

185
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,960
You taught me well.

186
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,240
One cannot hesitate to kill.

187
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,400
Yes.

188
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,560
I taught you that.

189
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,840
Now,

190
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,240
you've mastered it all.

191
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,320
Duke of Defender, do you admit

192
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,360
this evidence or not?

193
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,600
What difference does it make

194
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,640
if I admit it or not?

195
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,440
If you admit,

196
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,720
you'll be executed according to the law.

197
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,200
Considering your past merits,

198
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,800
I allow you to take your own life.

199
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,880
If you deny it,

200
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,560
then Princess Guyu committed
the crime of forging evidence

201
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,040
and defaming a Duke
of an imperial court.

202
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,720
So she would be the one
who will be executed.

203
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:50,640
Sister, since you left,

204
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,480
I have not experienced happiness.

205
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,920
Only when I saw Yunjiao again

206
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,480
did I feel happiness once more.

207
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:02,800
Perhaps,

208
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,560
all of this is fate.

209
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,760
I

210
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,040
plead guilty.
