Your Highness,
you've been ill these days.

His Grace

23
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,800
is going to be executed.

24
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,280
What?

25
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,800
If she's at fault,

26
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,440
I'll bear the punishment

27
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,120

I'm sorry.

55
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,040
But I've done nothing wrong.

56
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,000
It's the Duke of Defender's fault.

57
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,920
He's my father.

58

He's your father, too.

59

He's not.

He's not my father.

You're to blame.

62
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,680
I've been trying so hard
since I was little

63
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,280
just to get his attention.

64
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,640
Look at what you've done.

65
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,800

00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,600
Why me?

and asked His Majesty to take you away.

You led this to him.

Impossible.

121
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,800
but he didn't send you back.

122
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,880
Why did he keep you in Longevity Shrine?

123
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,280
He wanted to kill you.

124
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,440
But he was kind enough

125
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,480
not to vent his anger at me.

126
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,720
I wouldn't ask for his pure love.

127
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,840

131
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,240
You're well aware of

132
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,320

Besides,

135
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,720
why did His Majesty show up
in the Longevity Shrine

136
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,800
when you were waiting for him?

137
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,800
I wasn't on the run,

138
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,520
nor had I lived a helpless life.

139
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,680
Instead of living
in your sinful mansion,

Does he really deserve your trust?

144
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,200
Yes, he does.

145
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,480

You didn't bring it to me.

Your Majesty.

204
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,360
Please rise.

205
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,880
I was expecting another tough battle.

206
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,520
But I suddenly received news

207
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,800
that the Duke of Defender

208
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:51,800
has already renounced
the military power.

209
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,520
His private army outside dispersed

210
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,800
once they heard this.

211
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,080
Yes. The Duke has already been executed.

212
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,000
Executed?

213
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,080
How did you manage that?

214
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,440
I don't think

215
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,040
I should report that to you.

216
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,080
Your Majesty.

217
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:09,800
Where is Yunjiao?

218
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,480
She has left.

219
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,240
Don't look for her.

220
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,280
Your Majesty.

221
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,360
Where is Yunjiao?

222
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,840
Murong Cang, do you intend to kill me?

223
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,320
Do you actually disgrace yourself

224
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,840
for a woman?

225
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,080
You can kill me at any time.

226
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,960
But don't touch her.

227
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,280
Hate me all you like.

228
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,960
Even if you got this letter,

229
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:38,680
[I've found evidence against the Duke.]

230
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,040
the Duke wouldn't admit it.

231
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,260
[Let's meet at Longevity Shrine
tomorrow at the hour of Mao.]

232
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,560
I had no other choice.

233
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,040
I'll explain to her.

234
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:51,240
Stop right there.

235
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,480
Think this through.

236
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,600
For some secrets,
some will lose their lives

237
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,080
for knowing it.

238
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,280
You're in a vulnerable state now.

239
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,880
It's best if she forgets about you.

240
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,320
From now on,

241
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,920
