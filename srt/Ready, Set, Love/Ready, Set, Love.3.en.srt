00:00:11,625 --> 00:00:13,000
Come on, hurry.

2
00:00:28,791 --> 00:00:31,416
We need to keep going. Are you okay?

3
00:00:32,458 --> 00:00:34,458
All right.

4
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:41,833
Let's go.

5
00:00:51,291 --> 00:00:52,291
It's okay.

6
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:54,333
It's okay.

7
00:01:12,666 --> 00:01:13,541
Son.

8
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:30,875
Son…

9
00:01:30,958 --> 00:01:33,583
Dad!

10
00:01:34,708 --> 00:01:35,875
Keep going.

11
00:01:37,791 --> 00:01:40,791

Looking good, Pob.

27
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:32,541
There is a restricted area
that even The Gentlemen can't get to.

28
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:34,041
That's where they hide.

29
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:58,000
Son, keep going! Get away from here.

30
00:03:58,083 --> 00:03:59,833
Dad!

31
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:27,708
I don't know what your plan was,
but you weren't yourself at all.

32
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:29,125
You weren't being genuine.

33
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:32,291
"I wanna become
part of The Family,

34
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:35,083
and it would be great if I were with you."

35
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:38,583
I think you'd do
just about anything to win this.

36
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:39,791
Or say anything.

37
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:17,375
Okay, little one.
I think it's time you showed yourself.

38
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:20,750
When can I see?

39
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:22,708
It won't be long.

40
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:24,583
The little scamp is hiding.

41
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:27,000
It's cheeky like you, babe.

42
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:34,333
Hi, little one. There you are.

43
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:49,333
-Babe?
-Hm?

44
00:05:50,666 --> 00:05:51,625
What is it?

45
00:05:57,541 --> 00:05:58,500
What's the matter?

46
00:06:11,708 --> 00:06:13,166
Good morning, Almond.

47
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:16,166
Good morning, Kaew.

48
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,666
Enjoy your breakfast.

49
00:06:18,833 --> 00:06:21,041
-Enjoy yours as well.
-Thank you.

50
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:23,250
-Would you like a donut, Son?
-No, thanks.

51
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:24,958
Hello.

52
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:29,500
Those donuts really bring out
the color in your eyes.

53
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:32,750
Oh.

54
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:37,833
Hey, Son.

55
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:40,500
Can we talk?

56
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:45,083
What's going on? You look serious.

57
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:48,791
This is awkward, but…

58
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:55,625
You're not after Day, right?

59
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:00,291
Why do you ask?

60
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,083
Well, she caught my eye
in the audition round.

61
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:06,791
But then you chose to save her.

62
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:09,000
And then she picked you for the date,

63
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:10,416
so I thought that was it.

64
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:17,500
But then after the dinner last night,
you rated her a four.

65
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:19,125
So I'll ask you straight.

66
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:21,958
Tell me… what do you think of her?

67
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:32,583
Okay, if you're gonna be like that,

68
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,833
then I won't feel guilty going after her.

69
00:07:39,666 --> 00:07:41,500
Feel free to do whatever you'd like.

70
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,958
Mm. I'm not into her.

71
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:17,958
Hello, tofu face.

72
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:31,041
Nothing to it.

73
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:39,000
Almost… almost.

74
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:43,541
Just a little bit more.

75
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:44,958
Oh!

76
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:57,666
Oh, come on.

77
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:00,708
This cereal again?
You shouldn't eat this junk.

78
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:02,208
It'll affect your studies.

79
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:04,041
And who says that it's junk?

80
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:07,000
-Look at this.
-<i>Enjoy nutritious goodness…</i>

81
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:15,333
Start every day with nutrition.

82
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:20,375
Packed with nutrients for life.

83
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:24,000
<i>CocoCorn, your delicious choice every day.</i>

84
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:26,083
It's your delicious choice
every day.

85
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:27,458
Are you done?

86
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:30,708
Yes, I'm done.

87
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:33,791
You wanted this, right?

88
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:37,583
Thank you. Oh!

89
00:09:50,541 --> 00:09:51,458
You got this.

90
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:55,208
Don't forget to eat… some nutrients.

91
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:01,166
You look like tofu!

92
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:09,500
And I hate tofu!

93
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:19,666
I knew it.

94
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:22,541
Now you're a fan of Chun as well, right?

95
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:23,875
Who's that?

96
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:25,916
Um, the song you were humming,

97
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:27,916
it's a song of his.

98
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:31,666
It goes like…

99
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:35,833
<i>♪ Beyond the wall</i>
<i>Where tears no longer fall ♪</i>

100
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:36,750
Right?

101
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:38,791
Um, it's one of Chun's.

102
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:42,125
So, who is this guy?

103
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:44,875
I know a lot of singers on The Farm,

104
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:47,916
but… none that sound like that.

105
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:53,291
Hm?

106
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:54,791
-Come here.
-What is it?

107
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:56,166
Just come here, okay?

108
00:10:57,833 --> 00:11:01,541
So Chun is a man
who's not on The Farm.

109
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:05,500
He's a man who's never
even been on The Farm.

110
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:06,416
Huh?

111
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:14,708
Hey, Paper, I'm just kidding.

112
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:16,000
I'm just messing.

113
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:19,333
Of course there are no men
outside The Farm.

114
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:22,083
It's probably a woman, okay?

115
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:24,875
And with the software these days,

116
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:27,916
they've probably used it
to make her sound like a man.

117
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:34,083
And the stories about
men living outside The Farm

118
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:35,833
are just crazy stuff on the Internet.

119
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:41,541
If you're curious, you could maybe text?

120
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:43,875
Try that.

121
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:51,916
<i>Sure, you knew the rules in advance</i>

122
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,291
<i>and were on the favorite team to win,</i>

123
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:56,583
<i>yet you still ended up losing.</i>

124
00:11:57,125 --> 00:11:59,125
<i>I expect better than this, Chanel.</i>

125
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:02,208
Sorry.

126
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:07,291
Do you even realize
that everything I do is for you?

127
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:12,041
Yes.

128
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:15,208
You will not fail again. Am I clear?

129
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:19,166
-I'll win.
<i>-Good.</i>

130
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:50,208
Oh, go ahead.

131
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:56,333
Let me get that for you.

132
00:12:57,458 --> 00:12:59,291
Uh, I can manage.

133
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:01,958
Uh…

134
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:03,875
Did you sleep all right?

135
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:06,458
Yeah.

136
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:10,250
I hope today that you get put on my team

137
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:14,291
and that we win and have another date.

138
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:15,958
What do you think?

139
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:26,000
As of today in this competition,
I'll only ever choose Son.

140
00:13:33,416 --> 00:13:34,708
What about our last date?

141
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,583
I hope you understand

142
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:46,208
that was for content.

143
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:56,541
Hm. Got it.

144
00:14:07,416 --> 00:14:09,041
Hey, let me help you.

145
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:11,416
Oh, you're only having salad?

146
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:16,541
Chal, check this out.

147
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:19,375
#MAXCHAL is trending on social media.

148
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:23,541
-Oh, there's a lot of buzz about you two.
-What's the matter?

149
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:26,291
Are you afraid I might steal him from you?

150
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:30,458
What? Of course not,
because you already like Son.

151
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:33,291
But you had to match up
with someone else because--

152
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:34,666
Because you messed up.

153
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,333
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe!

154
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:49,375
Ah, right.

155
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:52,958
But don't you worry,
because today I'm gonna help you, okay?

156
00:14:53,041 --> 00:14:54,291
You'll win, for sure.

157
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:56,500
You mean like last time?

158
00:14:57,708 --> 00:14:58,583
Don't bother.

159
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:03,916
-Where are you going?
-Another table.

160
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:09,041
You stay there, out of my sight.

161
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:30,958
Hm. How do you think you'll go
in the next game?

162
00:15:32,791 --> 00:15:34,708
Huh? How should I know?

163
00:15:34,791 --> 00:15:36,041
I don't know what it is.

164
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,541
-Hello, there.
-Hi.

165
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:45,916
Welcome back to…

166
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,541
<i>Ready, Set, Love!</i>

167
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:50,958
<i>You might be wondering</i>
<i>what we're wearing.</i>

168
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:53,375
We're actually dressed to match the game.

169
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:56,875
Oh darn. And I thought
we might be heading outside today.

170
00:15:57,875 --> 00:16:01,208
That's exactly what
our Ladies and Gentlemen are doing now,

171
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:04,458
because today's challenge
will be outside The Farm.

172
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:10,208
<i>Ladies and Gentlemen,</i>
<i>are you ready for the show?</i>

173
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:16,000
<i>Five, four, three, two…</i>

174
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:25,958
<i>Good morning, Ladies.</i>

175
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:30,000
<i>Today we'll be going on a trip.</i>

176
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:34,750
<i>This challenge</i>
<i>will further grow the relationships</i>

177
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:38,458
<i>between The Ladies and The Gentlemen.</i>

178
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:42,625
<i>You'll be enjoying</i>
<i>your first trip out of town together.</i>

179
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:50,750
<i>Today's challenge</i>
<i>is Racing to Love,</i>

180
00:16:50,833 --> 00:16:52,208
<i>a treasure hunt.</i>

181
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:01,416
Oh, hey.

182
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:09,458
Oy!

183
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:15,083
<i>Ladies, touch your smartwatch</i>
<i>to randomly select your team.</i>

184
00:17:32,958 --> 00:17:34,375
Oh, don't tell me.

185
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:43,500
No!

186
00:17:55,666 --> 00:18:00,083
<i>This challenge is adapted</i>
<i>from a board game with dice.</i>

187
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:02,000
<i>These are the rules.</i>

188
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:06,125
<i>Players roll the dice</i>
<i>and travel a set distance</i>

189
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:08,166
<i>until they cross the finish line.</i>

190
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:12,250
Sounds like fun.

191
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:15,916
What the--

192
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:22,000
<i>The numbers on the dice indicate</i>
<i>which checkpoint the team must travel to.</i>

193
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:25,083
<i>The dice can only be used one time.</i>

194
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,333
<i>Players will receive a new set</i>

195
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:31,166
<i>after clearing the game</i>
<i>at each checkpoint.</i>

196
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:36,083
<i>There are secret cards</i>
<i>hidden at certain checkpoints.</i>

197
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:38,541
<i>If any of The Ladies find the card,</i>

198
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:42,458
<i>they can use it</i>
<i>to steal points from last round's winners.</i>

199
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:46,708
<i>The team that finishes last</i>
<i>will be sent home.</i>

200
00:18:47,416 --> 00:18:49,083
Sent home?

201
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:52,916
It's all good, it's all good.
We'll be all right.

202
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:58,583
<i>When you're ready,</i>
<i>you can begin by rolling the dice.</i>

203
00:18:58,666 --> 00:19:00,458
-Come on.
-Where'd they go?

204
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:03,541
What?

205
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:08,916
<i>Wishing you luck</i>
<i>for your first dice roll.</i>

206
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,083
<i>The higher the number,</i>
<i>the further you can travel.</i>

207
00:19:21,916 --> 00:19:24,416
-What's your number? Come on!
-It's five for number three.

208
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:30,708
Five.

209
00:19:30,791 --> 00:19:34,625
<i>Please enter the car</i>
<i>and prepare to begin your journey.</i>

210
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:36,208
No, this way!

211
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:38,791
-You drive,
-Why's that?

212
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:40,541
-I don't have a license.
-Uh…

213
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:41,500
Come on.

214
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:45,875
Listen, let me make this
perfectly clear, okay?

215
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,916
Both of you need to help me,
so don't be dead weights,

216
00:19:50,541 --> 00:19:51,666
especially you.

217
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:54,500
Yeah, especially you, Day.

218
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:56,083
-You, as well.
-Huh?

219
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:58,416
What are you all doing? Let's go.

220
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,333
Okay.

221
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,333
Ooh!

222
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:11,208
-What are we even doing here?
-Get in the car, Lotto.

223
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:15,916
Move!

224
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:25,833
<i>Welcome to Racing to Love.</i>

225
00:20:25,916 --> 00:20:28,583
I can't really see the screen from here.

226
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:31,791
I'd say it's so the passenger
can act as navigator.

227
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:38,375
I'll help you, Chal.

228
00:20:39,833 --> 00:20:41,500
I'll be fine. I don't need your help.

229
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:43,875
So relax. I can navigate.

230
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:48,541
Okay, so let's get moving.

231
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:54,125
<i>Please wait for the signal</i>
<i>from the GPS to start the race.</i>

232
00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:57,875
-Why are you pushing me?
-I'm trying to look at the screen.

233
00:20:57,958 --> 00:20:59,250
<i>Ready, set, go!</i>

234
00:21:10,916 --> 00:21:13,916
-Uh, left, left. You need to go left.
-Okay.

235
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:14,833
Yeah.

236
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,083
And then there's another left turn?

237
00:21:23,708 --> 00:21:25,833
Left, left! You have to make a left.

238
00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:28,041
-Left again?
-Yeah, turn here!

239
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:31,166
DEAD END

240
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:33,208
Dead end.

241
00:21:39,541 --> 00:21:42,000
Left, left, left.
Yeah. Turn left. Just here.

242
00:21:43,458 --> 00:21:44,375
DEAD END

243
00:21:44,958 --> 00:21:46,125
Dead end?

244
00:21:51,708 --> 00:21:54,125
-Left, left, left!
-Left again?

245
00:21:54,208 --> 00:21:55,291
Yeah!

246
00:21:57,208 --> 00:21:58,166
DEAD END

247
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,833
Dead end?

248
00:22:10,166 --> 00:22:11,041
Hm.

249
00:22:12,083 --> 00:22:13,916
When using a GPS,

250
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,708
always trust someone
who was a delivery driver.

251
00:22:19,333 --> 00:22:20,291
Let's go!

252
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:25,750
Turn right.
Right, right, right! Step on it.

253
00:22:25,833 --> 00:22:28,791
Then the road will be clear,
but not for long. So get moving.

254
00:22:28,875 --> 00:22:31,583
Ah! Look at the time.
We'll never make it at this rate.

255
00:22:31,666 --> 00:22:33,250
Why is this guy moving like a snail?

256
00:22:33,333 --> 00:22:35,250
God! Use the horn. Hurry up!

257
00:22:35,833 --> 00:22:37,791
You gotta honk the horn, all right?

258
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:42,791
Hey! Is there something on the road?

259
00:22:42,875 --> 00:22:44,250
I don't see anything.

260
00:22:45,208 --> 00:22:46,833
Come on! Why are you stopping?

261
00:22:46,916 --> 00:22:48,416
-You done?
-What do you mean?

262
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,708
I mean are you done?

263
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:07,875
I'm all set.

264
00:23:11,958 --> 00:23:15,083
In 300 meters, take a left into the alley.

265
00:23:15,166 --> 00:23:16,333
-Got it.
-Mm.

266
00:23:19,875 --> 00:23:21,291
Proper navigating.

267
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:43,375
<i>At this checkpoint,</i>
<i>players must decipher the puzzle</i>

268
00:23:43,458 --> 00:23:47,458
<i>to discover the four digits</i>
<i>to unlock the case</i>

269
00:23:47,541 --> 00:23:49,041
<i>and retrieve the dice.</i>

270
00:23:49,125 --> 00:23:51,708
Hi, Max!

271
00:23:53,291 --> 00:23:54,708
God. You're crazy.

272
00:24:10,291 --> 00:24:11,333
Let's do this.

273
00:24:11,958 --> 00:24:14,333
And we'll see who opens theirs first.

274
00:24:14,916 --> 00:24:15,958
All right.

275
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:21,875
VERTICAL MOON

276
00:24:24,833 --> 00:24:27,208
ABOVE WILD HORSES, DADDY DANCES

277
00:24:28,041 --> 00:24:29,041
It's really hard.

278
00:24:33,291 --> 00:24:34,333
I already know the answer.

279
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:37,916
But I like a challenge.

280
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:39,583
You wanna play the game?

281
00:24:43,916 --> 00:24:46,083
You can go up against one of my teammates.

282
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:49,500
Who will it be?

283
00:24:50,208 --> 00:24:51,208
I'll do it, Son.

284
00:25:05,083 --> 00:25:05,916
All right.

285
00:25:11,083 --> 00:25:12,666
VERTICAL MOON

286
00:25:14,083 --> 00:25:15,958
ABOVE WILD HORSES, DADDY DANCES

287
00:25:31,166 --> 00:25:32,083
Max, go, go!

288
00:25:32,916 --> 00:25:34,208
Chal, go, go!

289
00:25:34,291 --> 00:25:35,708
Max, go, go!

290
00:25:35,791 --> 00:25:36,916
Chal, go, go!

291
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,041
Max, go--

292
00:25:38,125 --> 00:25:40,875
Hey. Is she really up to this?

293
00:25:40,958 --> 00:25:41,958
Look at her.

294
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:43,875
Oh please.

295
00:25:43,958 --> 00:25:47,000
Someone like Chal,
she'll work it out fast.

296
00:25:47,708 --> 00:25:49,208
-Uh-huh.
-Can she do it faster than Max?

297
00:25:49,875 --> 00:25:52,583
Despite his looks,
he's actually very smart.

298
00:25:53,541 --> 00:25:55,916
Especially when he's showing off
for The Ladies.

299
00:25:57,541 --> 00:25:59,958
Did you compliment him or insult him?

300
00:26:09,375 --> 00:26:12,125
"Above wild horses."

301
00:26:12,625 --> 00:26:13,666
"Above…"

302
00:26:16,333 --> 00:26:17,625
2172

303
00:26:19,166 --> 00:26:20,208
No way.

304
00:26:23,291 --> 00:26:25,208
-Two…
-You got this!

305
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:27,625
-…one…
-He's got this!

306
00:26:28,208 --> 00:26:29,041
…seven.

307
00:26:32,666 --> 00:26:33,583
Ooh!

308
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:38,583
Huh? Why are you waiting?

309
00:26:48,708 --> 00:26:49,958
Hurry! Come on!

310
00:26:51,458 --> 00:26:53,333
You know you haven't won yet.

311
00:26:53,416 --> 00:26:56,250
It's first across the finish line.
Later, losers!

312
00:26:56,791 --> 00:26:58,125
What? Wait, Max!

313
00:26:59,625 --> 00:27:01,750
-Oh.
-What a weirdo.

314
00:27:02,708 --> 00:27:04,416
Hey, Max!

315
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,750
-I'm coming, I'm coming!
-Let's go.

316
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:09,083
-Wait for me!
-Bovy, we're on this team!

317
00:27:10,833 --> 00:27:14,791
Vertical moon would be like that.

318
00:27:14,875 --> 00:27:18,583
-So if you turn it up this way…
-It's the English word "moon."

319
00:27:18,666 --> 00:27:22,208
<i>When you read them vertically,</i>
<i>it's quite clear.</i>

320
00:27:22,291 --> 00:27:24,250
Three-zero-zero-two.

321
00:27:27,625 --> 00:27:29,458
Huh? That's right.

322
00:27:30,083 --> 00:27:31,291
How did you know?

323
00:27:31,375 --> 00:27:32,666
You're so smart.

324
00:27:33,208 --> 00:27:34,291
In this car,

325
00:27:34,375 --> 00:27:37,583
me and Lotto are the only ones
who couldn't figure it out.

326
00:27:37,666 --> 00:27:40,416
Hey, hey, hey, hey. I, uh, I got it,

327
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,166
Ages before any of you.

328
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:45,208
I just… kept it to myself.

329
00:27:45,291 --> 00:27:46,666
That's smart.

330
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:49,666
She's lying. God, how gullible are you?

331
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:53,541
-What?
-And you totally believed it.

332
00:28:00,375 --> 00:28:02,833
You're terrible. I'll get you back.

333
00:28:09,125 --> 00:28:11,916
Mr. Pob? Mr. Pob.

334
00:28:15,416 --> 00:28:16,250
What?

335
00:28:16,333 --> 00:28:18,833
Excuse me,
but may I take your picture?

336
00:28:19,458 --> 00:28:21,083
You're not getting an exclusive.

337
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:24,041
Oh, well, it's for my mother.
She's a really big fan.

338
00:28:24,125 --> 00:28:26,875
Your mom's in the fan club?
Oh! No problem.

339
00:28:26,958 --> 00:28:29,208
-You after a pic?
-Two or three would be great.

340
00:28:29,291 --> 00:28:30,416
Yeah, yeah.

341
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:33,583
-What kind of pose? A handsome one?
-Oh, she'd love that.

342
00:28:33,666 --> 00:28:35,125
One, two, three.

343
00:28:35,208 --> 00:28:36,666
That's great. Thank you.

344
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:38,625
And could you do the "like" pose?

345
00:28:38,708 --> 00:28:40,791
-Bit more facing the camera.
-Double like.

346
00:28:40,875 --> 00:28:42,500
Oh, great.

347
00:28:50,333 --> 00:28:52,625
Okay, everyone,
let's clear the set.

348
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:54,333
Got what you need?

349
00:29:11,041 --> 00:29:13,166
<i>Let's see how</i>
<i>our contestants are doing.</i>

350
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:17,375
Right now, things aren't looking good
for Team Jin and Team Paper, right?

351
00:29:17,458 --> 00:29:19,958
<i>Both teams are still</i>
<i>at the first checkpoint.</i>

352
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:26,541
And the team that's taken the lead
is, of course, Son's team,

353
00:29:26,625 --> 00:29:29,916
<i>who have just arrived</i>
<i>at the Game Center checkpoint.</i>

354
00:29:35,666 --> 00:29:36,500
Wow.

355
00:29:59,666 --> 00:30:00,875
There's no keypad.

356
00:30:02,208 --> 00:30:04,125
And there's only one chest.

357
00:30:05,625 --> 00:30:08,750
And that's because
there's probably only one die.

358
00:30:09,625 --> 00:30:12,291
The first ones to open it
will get to keep it.

359
00:30:12,375 --> 00:30:15,500
The teams that come after
won't get the key.

360
00:30:16,916 --> 00:30:19,208
We need to work out
how to find that key now.

361
00:30:19,291 --> 00:30:24,041
The symbols are probably a clue
to where the only key is hidden.

362
00:30:25,291 --> 00:30:26,166
Exactly.

363
00:30:26,875 --> 00:30:29,041
The key has to be here somewhere.

364
00:30:29,125 --> 00:30:31,208
Why don't we split into pairs to find it?

365
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:37,583
Hmm.

366
00:30:37,666 --> 00:30:40,833
You and Bovy both go that way
and check for the key down that end.

367
00:30:41,458 --> 00:30:44,083
You and me, we'll go that end.

368
00:30:46,833 --> 00:30:47,750
What?

369
00:30:53,041 --> 00:30:54,208
Is there a problem?

370
00:30:56,541 --> 00:30:57,500
I guess not.

371
00:30:58,458 --> 00:30:59,666
Then let's split up.

372
00:31:00,875 --> 00:31:01,708
Okay.

373
00:31:10,208 --> 00:31:11,666
Come on. Let's go, then.

374
00:31:37,791 --> 00:31:39,750
-What are you looking at?
-Uh…

375
00:31:40,541 --> 00:31:42,583
Shouldn't we be
trying to find the key?

376
00:31:43,583 --> 00:31:44,416
Mm, mm.

377
00:31:52,166 --> 00:31:54,916
I thought you said
your necklace wasn't important,

378
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:57,958
but you're wearing it again.

379
00:32:06,458 --> 00:32:10,291
I know that you paired us up
because you want to pick a fight with me.

380
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,625
I'm not arguing with you, Son.

381
00:32:13,875 --> 00:32:15,041
I don't want to fight.

382
00:32:15,541 --> 00:32:18,166
I chose you to pair up with me
because I wanted to…

383
00:32:19,791 --> 00:32:20,916
apologize.

384
00:32:27,916 --> 00:32:28,833
I'm sorry.

385
00:32:32,541 --> 00:32:34,416
What are you sorry for, exactly?

386
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:36,500
Is it for accusing me of being a stalker?

387
00:32:36,583 --> 00:32:39,000
Or giving me an insultingly low score?

388
00:32:39,083 --> 00:32:41,333
Or is it for putting the cereal
up so high?

389
00:32:41,416 --> 00:32:44,458
Because I'm really confused now.
There are so many things.

390
00:32:44,541 --> 00:32:45,375
Um…

391
00:32:46,375 --> 00:32:48,458
It's for someone who has an easy life

392
00:32:49,041 --> 00:32:51,333
having the nerve to criticize
someone who doesn't.

393
00:32:55,416 --> 00:32:59,041
Even though I think we don't
really understand anything,

394
00:33:00,125 --> 00:33:01,458
we judge others.

395
00:33:04,625 --> 00:33:05,750
I'm truly sorry.

396
00:33:23,166 --> 00:33:25,708
Actually, it was exactly like you said.

397
00:33:27,375 --> 00:33:30,958
On our date, I really wasn't me at all.

398
00:33:32,208 --> 00:33:34,166
I'm so embarrassed.

399
00:33:34,833 --> 00:33:38,375
The way I said that my passion
was to be with you

400
00:33:38,458 --> 00:33:40,041
and be part of The Family…

401
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:47,375
When the truth is that
I don't even know what my passion is.

402
00:33:47,458 --> 00:33:49,875
It's not something that I ever consider.

403
00:33:49,958 --> 00:33:54,958
The real reason I'm in this competition
is to be able to give my sister

404
00:33:55,625 --> 00:33:57,833
the best medical care I possibly can.

405
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:03,625
As far as marrying one of The Gentlemen
and being part of The Family…

406
00:34:06,125 --> 00:34:08,458
I really couldn't care less about that.

407
00:34:16,583 --> 00:34:18,250
I hope that you win this…

408
00:34:19,333 --> 00:34:20,291
Lotto Girl.

409
00:34:28,958 --> 00:34:31,041
Uh…

410
00:34:31,125 --> 00:34:33,208
Shouldn't we go back and find the key?

411
00:34:37,458 --> 00:34:38,291
Uh…

412
00:34:54,916 --> 00:34:55,750
There it is.

413
00:34:57,583 --> 00:34:58,708
Move over.

414
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:07,000
Everyone, we found it! Come here!

415
00:35:11,375 --> 00:35:12,708
Looking at these symbols,

416
00:35:12,791 --> 00:35:16,750
the three lines
might indicate the claw up here.

417
00:35:17,416 --> 00:35:20,333
The paw print
must mean the bear with the key.

418
00:35:21,083 --> 00:35:23,750
Those arrows tell us how to move the claw.

419
00:35:23,833 --> 00:35:26,041
Up and down to get the bear.

420
00:35:28,208 --> 00:35:31,291
Except… the last one I don't get.

421
00:35:31,833 --> 00:35:32,666
Yeah.

422
00:35:33,166 --> 00:35:34,333
Across.

423
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:36,166
Hm?

424
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:40,125
There's one here.

425
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:45,708
There are keys in both boxes,
but there's only one chest.

426
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:50,000
Well, that means
if another team were to get here,

427
00:35:51,291 --> 00:35:52,666
it'd be a race.

428
00:35:53,416 --> 00:35:54,875
Oh, hey.

429
00:35:55,791 --> 00:35:57,958
But that means we've won, right?

430
00:35:58,041 --> 00:35:59,791
We're the only team that's here.

431
00:35:59,875 --> 00:36:04,333
Chal, Chal! We won, we won!

432
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,125
Well, well…

433
00:36:06,625 --> 00:36:08,291
You found this place too, huh?

434
00:36:10,083 --> 00:36:11,625
<i>At this checkpoint,</i>

435
00:36:11,708 --> 00:36:15,916
<i>players must use teamwork in order to win.</i>

436
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:23,041
<i>Our claw machine</i>
<i>is designed to be played by four people.</i>

437
00:36:23,125 --> 00:36:24,125
Oh, I see.

438
00:36:24,208 --> 00:36:26,250
That's why she said "teamwork."

439
00:36:27,458 --> 00:36:28,666
It's like a Ouija board.

440
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:31,625
<i>When the claw</i>
<i>lines up with the doll,</i>

441
00:36:31,708 --> 00:36:34,875
<i>release your hands at the same time</i>

442
00:36:34,958 --> 00:36:36,291
<i>to lower the crane.</i>

443
00:36:36,875 --> 00:36:40,708
<i>Please remember, everyone, that teamwork…</i>

444
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:42,583
Is power.

445
00:36:42,666 --> 00:36:44,375
Is power!

446
00:36:45,791 --> 00:36:48,375
-We have to move it to the right.
-Oh, right, right.

447
00:36:49,125 --> 00:36:50,500
We need to go left.

448
00:36:52,166 --> 00:36:53,083
Yeah, left.

449
00:36:55,875 --> 00:36:58,291
-What are you doing, Lotto? Left!
-Right!

450
00:36:58,375 --> 00:37:00,583
-No, that's not it.
-Hey, not that way!

451
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,875
-Follow my lead.
-Okay.

452
00:37:03,958 --> 00:37:05,125
To the left.

453
00:37:05,208 --> 00:37:06,333
Uh-huh.

454
00:37:06,416 --> 00:37:07,625
And a little up.

455
00:37:07,708 --> 00:37:09,083
-Mm.
-That's it.

456
00:37:10,541 --> 00:37:12,291
-Left!
-Right!

457
00:37:12,375 --> 00:37:14,000
-Left!
-Right!

458
00:37:14,083 --> 00:37:15,250
-Left!
-Right!

459
00:37:15,333 --> 00:37:17,125
-Gosh, what's wrong with your eyes?
-Right.

460
00:37:17,208 --> 00:37:18,666
-No, that's wrong.
-Stop!

461
00:37:20,916 --> 00:37:22,333
Teamwork is…

462
00:37:23,083 --> 00:37:24,291
Power.

463
00:37:26,916 --> 00:37:27,875
-You got that?
-Right.

464
00:37:28,583 --> 00:37:30,125
-Back it up,
-Mm-hmm.

465
00:37:31,375 --> 00:37:32,291
That looks good.

466
00:37:32,791 --> 00:37:34,750
-Okay.
-Now, everybody at the same time.

467
00:37:35,875 --> 00:37:38,583
One, two, three.

468
00:37:54,625 --> 00:37:57,041
Ooh.

469
00:37:57,125 --> 00:37:59,833
They just nearly got it then.

470
00:37:59,916 --> 00:38:01,125
It's okay.

471
00:38:01,208 --> 00:38:03,250
It was a good effort
for our first attempt, everyone.

472
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:06,833
We haven't lost yet.

473
00:38:07,875 --> 00:38:09,375
But we have to work together.

474
00:38:25,291 --> 00:38:26,125
That looks okay.

475
00:38:27,208 --> 00:38:28,458
No. Right.

476
00:38:32,541 --> 00:38:34,375
I'm not messing with you, Lotto.

477
00:38:34,458 --> 00:38:35,875
If you lose, so do I.

478
00:38:47,625 --> 00:38:48,458
That's it.

479
00:38:58,125 --> 00:38:58,958
One…

480
00:39:00,541 --> 00:39:01,541
two…

481
00:39:04,541 --> 00:39:05,625
three.

482
00:39:58,041 --> 00:39:59,958
It's okay, it's okay. Good work, everyone.

483
00:40:09,083 --> 00:40:11,791
Hey, we're in the lead!

484
00:40:11,875 --> 00:40:13,666
No way!

485
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:15,083
-Guys, look.
-Nice!

486
00:40:20,666 --> 00:40:21,541
Hey.

487
00:40:22,958 --> 00:40:23,791
Yeah…

488
00:40:24,541 --> 00:40:25,375
About earlier?

489
00:40:28,375 --> 00:40:30,416
Sorry that I didn't trust you.

490
00:40:32,458 --> 00:40:34,083
It's like I said.

491
00:40:34,875 --> 00:40:36,333
You lose, so do I.

492
00:40:36,875 --> 00:40:37,750
That's all.

493
00:40:56,375 --> 00:40:57,208
What's that?

494
00:40:57,291 --> 00:40:58,791
Oh!

495
00:40:58,875 --> 00:41:01,625
It appears that Son's team
have a technical problem.

496
00:41:08,333 --> 00:41:09,916
<i>This is so disappointing.</i>

497
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
They've just lost their lead.

498
00:41:13,583 --> 00:41:15,750
Do you even know
how to change a tire?

499
00:41:20,333 --> 00:41:22,208
That's a tough break, my friend.

500
00:41:22,291 --> 00:41:25,583
But the winner of this game
is the first to cross the finish line.

501
00:41:25,666 --> 00:41:28,000
Chanel, it's been a pleasure.

502
00:41:30,166 --> 00:41:31,166
Bye!

503
00:41:38,625 --> 00:41:40,916
Hey, what are you doing?

504
00:41:44,333 --> 00:41:45,166
Okay.

505
00:41:45,875 --> 00:41:48,375
Step aside. I'll take care of this.

506
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:53,000
My God. Can she even do this?

507
00:42:03,708 --> 00:42:04,541
All done.

508
00:42:04,625 --> 00:42:05,750
Huh?

509
00:42:08,708 --> 00:42:09,791
How did she do that?

510
00:42:10,583 --> 00:42:12,875
She was ruthless with that tire.

511
00:42:13,458 --> 00:42:16,791
Well, apparently,
Day has experience in car repair.

512
00:42:17,541 --> 00:42:19,708
I know she's had a lot of jobs,

513
00:42:19,791 --> 00:42:22,583
but I have to wonder,
what hasn't she done?

514
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:26,250
Hm? What? Who?

515
00:42:27,041 --> 00:42:28,000
Wow.

516
00:42:29,416 --> 00:42:30,250
There you have it.

517
00:42:30,333 --> 00:42:33,000
She's a super-productive,
multitasking champ.

518
00:42:33,083 --> 00:42:35,916
-Stop showing off now, Day.
-Your order. Hurry!

519
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:39,333
Come on, then. We better get going.

520
00:42:39,416 --> 00:42:40,500
Quickly.

521
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,041
Don't stand there. We gotta go.

522
00:42:44,125 --> 00:42:45,125
Let's go now. Come on.

523
00:42:47,958 --> 00:42:48,791
More hustle.

524
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:00,166
<i>To complete the challenge,</i>

525
00:43:00,250 --> 00:43:04,750
<i>press the red button to confirm</i>
<i>your arrival at the finish line.</i>

526
00:43:22,625 --> 00:43:24,625
They're coming!

527
00:43:46,083 --> 00:43:48,375
Come on! Go, go, go, go!

528
00:43:48,458 --> 00:43:49,625
Go! Come on!

529
00:43:49,708 --> 00:43:54,708
I changed the tire. You'd better not lose!

530
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:03,666
<i>Here we go.</i>

531
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:05,208
His shirt's off now.

532
00:44:05,291 --> 00:44:06,750
Now it's serious.

533
00:44:07,625 --> 00:44:10,666
We're expecting Max,
with his impressive fitness routine,

534
00:44:10,750 --> 00:44:12,208
<i>to triumph over Son.</i>

535
00:44:13,458 --> 00:44:15,083
Oh yes, please!

536
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:20,208
Oh yeah!

537
00:44:20,708 --> 00:44:21,541
Why?

538
00:44:21,625 --> 00:44:24,250
It's really on now.

539
00:44:24,333 --> 00:44:25,750
<i>Son has taken his shirt off.</i>

540
00:44:25,833 --> 00:44:27,875
-He's ripped!
-He's what?

541
00:44:27,958 --> 00:44:29,458
-I mean, he's ripped his shirt.
-Oh.

542
00:45:03,083 --> 00:45:05,291
<i>The winner is Son.</i>

543
00:45:15,583 --> 00:45:20,500
<i>Before we get to tonight's dates,</i>
<i>let's recap today's challenge.</i>

544
00:45:20,583 --> 00:45:25,458
<i>Team Son pulled off a last-minute comeback</i>
<i>and secured first place.</i>

545
00:45:25,541 --> 00:45:28,916
<i>Max's team</i>
<i>takes second place in this round.</i>

546
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,791
<i>Followed by Team Almond</i>
<i>and Team Paper.</i>

547
00:45:31,875 --> 00:45:34,541
<i>Team Jin finished in last place.</i>

548
00:45:34,625 --> 00:45:38,833
<i>That means our three-M gang,</i>
<i>Mint, Maria, and Mild,</i>

549
00:45:38,916 --> 00:45:40,583
<i>have been eliminated.</i>

550
00:45:40,666 --> 00:45:43,166
-<i>3M? Are they Post-its?</i>
-<i>No, they're people.</i>

551
00:45:44,166 --> 00:45:47,666
Don't forget, Khaopoon managed
to find a steal card in this challenge.

552
00:45:47,750 --> 00:45:50,541
<i>The steal card means</i>
<i>that she can take points</i>

553
00:45:50,625 --> 00:45:53,500
from any of The Ladies
who got a date in the previous round.

554
00:45:53,583 --> 00:45:58,875
<i>And the lady whose points</i>
<i>she's chosen to steal is</i>……<i>Kaew.</i>

555
00:45:59,916 --> 00:46:03,875
<i>Wow. This gives Khaopoon</i>
<i>her first chance at a date.</i>

556
00:46:04,708 --> 00:46:09,083
Oh, we've made some minor changes
to the scoring.

557
00:46:09,875 --> 00:46:15,083
The popular vote won't be included
in the result this time.

558
00:46:16,333 --> 00:46:19,250
<i>A large fan base</i>
<i>won't help in this round. </i>

559
00:46:19,333 --> 00:46:21,916
And they think the fans
are gonna be okay with that?

560
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,000
We'll see.

561
00:46:30,416 --> 00:46:31,666
SUCH CRAP.

562
00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:33,083
UNFAIR.

563
00:46:33,166 --> 00:46:35,000
I QUIT WATCHING. GARBAGE.

564
00:46:35,083 --> 00:46:36,333
WILL THEY PULL THIS OFF?

565
00:46:36,416 --> 00:46:38,958
NOT WATCHING ANYMORE. TOTALLY RIGGED.

566
00:46:39,041 --> 00:46:41,500
KWAN: GREAT JOB

567
00:46:41,583 --> 00:46:44,208
THEY DON'T CARE. WE CAN SEE THEM CHEATING.

568
00:46:44,291 --> 00:46:46,333
SHOWING THEIR TRUE COLORS. WHAT A FLOP!

569
00:46:53,666 --> 00:46:54,750
It was close.

570
00:46:55,750 --> 00:46:57,416
Next game, I'll win.

571
00:46:58,416 --> 00:47:01,833
If you'd managed to open that chest
in the first game, you might've won it.

572
00:47:04,166 --> 00:47:06,916
Tell me,
what makes the most competitive guy

573
00:47:07,708 --> 00:47:10,416
into a great, big, mellow one?

574
00:47:20,208 --> 00:47:24,500
And what made our little Ice Prince
run like his life depended on it?

575
00:47:43,083 --> 00:47:44,000
Cheers.

576
00:48:07,875 --> 00:48:10,208
You know, Lotto Girl,

577
00:48:10,291 --> 00:48:14,083
you're not half as useless
as I thought you were.

578
00:48:17,166 --> 00:48:18,458
Is that a compliment?

579
00:48:22,833 --> 00:48:26,083
If not for this game,
I think we could have been friends.

580
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:02,500
<i>Chanel, please step forward</i>

581

<i>Day, please choose your date.</i>

590
00:50:22,041 --> 00:50:22,916
Yeah, yeah.

591
00:50:33,875 --> 00:50:35,291
Don't give me a low score.

592
00:50:37,208 --> 00:50:40,916
Um…
I could never give you a low score.

593
00:50:46,333 --> 00:50:47,333
Shall we?

594
00:50:48,291 --> 00:50:49,125
Sure.

595
00:50:49,208 --> 00:50:50,041
Okay.

596
00:51:23,125 --> 00:51:24,125
Just beautiful.

597
00:51:27,041 --> 00:51:29,833
Yeah. Super beautiful.

598
00:51:30,333 --> 00:51:32,750
And I'm sure the food is amazing.

599
00:51:32,833 --> 00:51:35,500
Hey, if I eat a lot, you can't judge.

600
00:51:35,583 --> 00:51:38,541
It's just I had
a really small lunch.

601
00:51:38,625 --> 00:51:41,125
Don't worry. I like a woman who eats.

602
00:51:42,208 --> 00:51:43,083
Hm.

603
00:51:44,166 --> 00:51:46,833
Hey, there's only four tables.

604
00:51:48,083 --> 00:51:51,708
<i>Before we begin,</i>
<i>there's something we need to tell you.</i>

605
00:51:52,375 --> 00:51:56,083
<i>One couple will not</i>
<i>be going on a date here tonight.</i>

606
00:51:56,166 --> 00:51:58,916
What?
Gee, it better not be Day.

607
00:52:01,833 --> 00:52:02,916
What is it now?

608
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:06,791
<i>That couple is… Day and Almond.</i>

609
00:52:08,916 --> 00:52:12,333
What?
They're at it again, messing with her.

610
00:52:13,166 --> 00:52:17,208
<i>Because Day has been awarded</i>
<i>the special date prize</i>

611
00:52:17,291 --> 00:52:20,666
<i>based on the popular vote</i>
<i>from viewers at home.</i>

612
00:52:20,750 --> 00:52:25,041
Yeah! That's so epic!

613
00:52:25,125 --> 00:52:27,666
Hey, they kept the public votes for <i>this.</i>

614
00:52:28,750 --> 00:52:31,333
Oh, now I feel terrible for being harsh.

615
00:52:32,416 --> 00:52:34,083
Sorry.

616
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:37,541
Special date? Huh?

617
00:52:38,208 --> 00:52:41,041
God, I didn't think
I was going to get to eat.

618
00:52:41,541 --> 00:52:44,458
Then they used the fan votes
for the special date.

619
00:52:45,041 --> 00:52:47,875
Wow, it really is special.

620
00:52:49,250 --> 00:52:52,125
Well, here we are.
Oh, let me get your seat.

621
00:52:56,041 --> 00:52:57,125
Oh, thank you.

622
00:52:59,875 --> 00:53:00,791
Oh.

623
00:53:02,916 --> 00:53:03,750
Mm.

624
00:53:15,708 --> 00:53:17,125
Uh…

625
00:53:30,625 --> 00:53:32,416
If you don't drink wine,
have something else.

626
00:53:33,333 --> 00:53:35,041
Oh, okay.

627
00:53:35,125 --> 00:53:36,500
Oh, here it is.

628
00:53:44,125 --> 00:53:46,541
Tonight you'll be starting
with shiro ebi shrimp.

629
00:53:46,625 --> 00:53:49,500
The middle is ensui uni,
topped with caviar.

630
00:53:49,583 --> 00:53:50,416
Enjoy your meal.

631
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:51,916
Thank you so much.

632
00:53:56,583 --> 00:53:57,416
Uh…

633
00:53:57,500 --> 00:53:58,666
Feel free to start.

634
00:53:58,750 --> 00:54:00,500
Will I just… go for it?

635
00:54:00,583 --> 00:54:01,583
Go ahead.

636
00:54:03,583 --> 00:54:05,916
Oh, it's…

637
00:54:11,958 --> 00:54:15,500
Mmm, mmm.

638
00:54:16,125 --> 00:54:17,291
Oh, it's so good.

639
00:54:17,375 --> 00:54:18,208
You like it?

640
00:54:19,250 --> 00:54:24,125
Oh, I got carried away
and finished it.

641
00:54:24,208 --> 00:54:26,291
-I should have savored it.
-Take my plate.

642
00:54:26,916 --> 00:54:28,291
Oh no, please.

643
00:54:28,375 --> 00:54:31,125
I couldn't. You enjoy your meal.

644
00:54:33,875 --> 00:54:34,708
Okay.

645
00:54:35,291 --> 00:54:36,125
Uh…

646
00:54:37,416 --> 00:54:40,625
Of course,
I wouldn't refuse your kindness.

647
00:54:42,208 --> 00:54:43,375
Thank you.

648
00:54:43,458 --> 00:54:44,875
Welcome.

649
00:54:44,958 --> 00:54:47,000
I never imagined I'd be eating this.

650
00:54:47,083 --> 00:54:49,750
I mean,
I've never even seen anything like it.

651
00:54:51,750 --> 00:54:54,458
This place feels like a… a dream.

652
00:54:56,458 --> 00:54:57,958
It feels like a dream to me too.

653
00:55:10,083 --> 00:55:11,625
The audience loves Day.

654
00:55:11,708 --> 00:55:13,541
It was smart to keep her around.

655
00:55:32,625 --> 00:55:34,333
Why aren't you mad at Chanel?

656
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,583
You're close to each other. I see that.

657
00:55:46,333 --> 00:55:47,958
But why do you go back to her

658
00:55:49,375 --> 00:55:50,916
when she pushes you away?

659
00:55:57,708 --> 00:55:59,166
It might seem like that.

660
00:56:00,250 --> 00:56:02,250
But please don't misunderstand her.

661
00:56:03,250 --> 00:56:06,708
When I was a kid,
nobody wanted to be my friend.

662
00:56:06,791 --> 00:56:09,875
But Chal did,
and she's always been by my side.

663
00:56:09,958 --> 00:56:11,916
She's so pretty and so smart.

664
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:16,250
She seems to have everything,
but her life isn't perfect.

665
00:56:17,625 --> 00:56:20,708
And I know from the outside,
she looks so fierce.

666
00:56:22,958 --> 00:56:24,625
She's really quite fragile.

667
00:56:26,541 --> 00:56:27,916
I could never leave her.

668
00:56:29,791 --> 00:56:32,791
I just hope that Son
isn't going to hurt her.
