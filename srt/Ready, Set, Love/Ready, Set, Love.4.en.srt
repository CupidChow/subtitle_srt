They're here! Run!

00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,375
Doctor, please take my baby and run!

5
00:00:23,875 --> 00:00:26,875
Mom, have you ever thought
that you imagined it?

6
00:00:28,833 --> 00:00:30,708
<i>I trusted them once.</i>

7
00:00:31,416 --> 00:00:33,333
I believed everything they said.

8
00:00:34,791 --> 00:00:36,375
<i>That I had lost my son</i>

9
00:00:36,458 --> 00:00:39,958

10
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:44,875
<i>But believe me, Valentine,</i>
<i>it was all lies.</i>

11
00:00:48,625 --> 00:00:52,083

Answer me.

36
00:02:57,875 --> 00:02:59,291
What are you doing here?

37
00:03:01,666 --> 00:03:02,500
It's all right.

38
00:03:04,791 --> 00:03:07,375
She was looking
for a new shooting location,

39
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:10,125
so I said I'd show her around.

40
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:13,833
I see.

41
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:18,333
Well then, remind her
that this is a restricted area.

42
00:03:18,416 --> 00:03:19,375
Of course.

43
00:03:20,375 --> 00:03:22,458
Thank you. Good night, Mr. Almond.

44
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:24,000
Good night.

45
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:31,916
Come on.

46
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:38,833
I remember you now.

47
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:40,166
What?

48
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:52,708
You conducted our interviews, right?

49
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:57,166
Yeah.

50
00:03:57,708 --> 00:03:59,541
Try to be more careful next time.

51
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:02,666
The Farm has a lot of restricted areas.

52
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:06,333
Even The Gentlemen can't go in there.

53
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:08,833
Got it.

54
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:10,500
Thanks a lot, Almond.

55
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:13,333
You got it.

56
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:16,250
I should get going.

57
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,500
Almond, wait.

58
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:23,208
Well…

59
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:28,958
Well, I…

60
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,125
Are you available for more footage?

61
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:39,208
<i>Attention, ladies.</i>

62
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:42,583
<i>There will be no shoot for the show today.</i>

63

<i>Please enjoy your time off.</i>

64
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:56,291
<i>That's crazy.</i>
<i>Son's got the same kind of necklace.</i>

65
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:57,708
<i>It isn't identical.</i>

66
00:04:57,791 --> 00:05:00,291
<i>But it is one of those ones</i>
<i>that fits together.</i>

67
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:36,041
Someone told me that…

68
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:41,958
you have a necklace like this?

69
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:45,333
You finally remembered.

70
00:06:49,291 --> 00:06:51,416
I…

71
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:53,250
It's…

72
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:55,125
You're really tall.

73
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:58,333
It really is you, isn't it?

74
00:06:58,416 --> 00:06:59,500
Mm.

75
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:15,416
Son… it's really you.

76
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:20,916
Hey, it's a bit tight.

77
00:07:21,583 --> 00:07:22,833
Oh!

78
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:26,500
Oh, gosh. Sorry! I got a bit excited.

79
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:28,416
Um…

80
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:30,583
So…

81
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:33,541
why'd it take you so long

82
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:35,750
to remember me?

83
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:42,041
Hey, you didn't remember me.

84
00:07:42,666 --> 00:07:44,583
And you accused me of being a stalker

85
00:07:44,666 --> 00:07:47,375
and you tried
to get me out of this competition.

86
00:07:47,458 --> 00:07:48,750
And who'd have thought…

87
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:50,916
What?

88
00:07:56,958 --> 00:07:57,791
That…

89
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,875
Meow Meow was

90
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:03,125
a boy.

91
00:08:08,208 --> 00:08:09,708
Go on in.

92
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:21,208
Welcome to my secret base, May Day.

93
00:08:33,416 --> 00:08:34,500
You hungry?

94
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,666
Which one?

95
00:08:49,291 --> 00:08:50,916
How come you can't talk?

96
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:57,500
You can live here now.

97
00:08:57,583 --> 00:08:59,416
I'll call you Meow Meow.

98
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,375
I've always wanted a cat, you know.

99
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:39,041
There's a playground nearby
and shops with desserts.

100
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:42,041
If you like,
we can go and see them tomorrow.

101
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,208
Do you know my mommy?

102
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:47,500
Oh, you can talk.

103
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:50,541
My dad said he would take me to my mommy.

104
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:52,333
Can you bring her to me?

105
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:56,000
Hm. There are lots of moms around.

106
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:58,625
Which one is your mom?

107
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:13,291
Before my mommy went to heaven,

108
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:15,541
she told me to keep this

109
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:19,500
and that it will protect whoever wears it.

110
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:37,625
Here. It'll help you
to find whoever you're looking for.

111
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:57,541
Hello, Meow Meow! Let's go out!

112
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:00,916
Meow Meow.

113
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:03,250
Oh!

114
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:08,250
Meow Meow?

115
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:10,708
Meow Meow?

116
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:14,458
Meow Meow?

117
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,708
And after that
you were brought back here?

118
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,541
Mm.

119
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:35,083
They wouldn't let me go that easily.

120
00:11:39,041 --> 00:11:42,041
And your father came back as well?

121
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:48,791
Dad.

122
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:50,375
Keep going!

123
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:52,291
-Get away from here.
-Dad!

124
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:53,250
<i>As for me…</i>

125
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:59,166
I'm no different
from the fish in this tank.

126
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,625
I get it now.

127
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:15,875
Why you looked so upset

128
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:18,666
when I said I wanted to stay here.

129
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:23,500
I always wondered

130
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:26,500
would we recognize each other

131
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:28,791
if we met some day?

132
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:33,375
I wondered
what you'd look like as an adult.

133
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:51,750
Mm.

134
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:57,000
Here.

135
00:12:58,541 --> 00:13:00,083
I give this back to you.

136
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:02,875
And let this necklace…

137
00:13:06,541 --> 00:13:07,916
protect you always.

138
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:24,083
Uh… Mm.

139
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:30,875
I… Wait here.

140
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:34,666
I gotta pee, okay?

141
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,416
Yeah.

142
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:40,125
Oh, wait a second.

143
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:46,625
It's our day off today.

144
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:49,625
We don't have a shoot
for <i>Ready, Set, Love, </i>right?

145
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:51,541
Hm.

146
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:53,833
Then…

147
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:56,500
let's go out.

148
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:00,375
What do you say?

149
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,875
<i>And to finish up today,</i>

150
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:24,750
<i>I'll be playing our most requested song.</i>

151
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:27,208
<i>Thanks for listening, everyone.</i>

152
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:29,458

<i>I was just fixing my radio</i>

163
00:15:40,041 --> 00:15:42,416
What? So Chun replied?

164
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:44,500
-And you talked all night?
-Mm.

165
00:15:47,291 --> 00:15:49,750
But he's never replied to anyone.

166
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,958
So? What did he say?

167
00:15:58,375 --> 00:15:59,916
Uh… Hey!

168
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:06,250
<i>I want to know more about you.</i>

169
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:09,583
<i>Tell me about the world outside.</i>

170
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,958
<i>The music you listen to.</i>

171
00:16:12,583 --> 00:16:13,791
<i>What books you read.</i>

172
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:19,833
<i>If you want to know that much,</i>
<i>how about we meet up?</i>

173
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:22,166
<i>I can't.</i>

174
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,083
<i>The Farm has strict rules.</i>

175
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:27,833
<i>I'm on a fixed schedule</i>

176
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:30,750
<i>and there are staff that follow me around.</i>

177
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:33,166
<i>Doesn't that bore you?</i>

178
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,208
<i>Don't you want to be free?</i>

179
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:40,916
<i>Hm…</i>

180
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:43,041
<i>I don't know.</i>

181
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:45,208
<i>I've lived here my whole life.</i>

182
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:47,416
<i>I've never known anything else.</i>

183
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:50,208
<i>It's like asking a fish</i>
<i>if they'd like to fly</i>

184

<i>like a bird in the sky.</i>

185

<i>They wouldn't be able to imagine it.</i>

186
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:57,333
<i>But you're not a fish.</i>

187
00:16:58,083 --> 00:17:01,333
<i>So why not come outside</i>
<i>and fly with the birds?</i>

188
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:14,958
What?

189
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:19,041
Oh, my God.
I'm blushing listening to this.

190
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:22,416
It sounds like a confession.

191
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,375
It does?

192
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:26,166
So…

193
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:29,000
how are you feeling?

194
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:33,708
Mm.

195
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:36,458
Don't know really.

196
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:40,208
I really like Chun.

197
00:17:42,791 --> 00:17:45,708
And I like you too, Bovy.

198
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:53,833
I don't know.

199
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:56,750
I don't know what I want.

200
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:04,125
How about we test it?

201
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:09,375
How?

202
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:34,250
What do you think?

203
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:54,625
Ah, you're just like me.

204
00:18:54,708 --> 00:18:57,708
I mean, I've kissed a lot of women
in dramas,

205
00:18:57,791 --> 00:19:00,791
but I thought kissing a man
would feel different.

206
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:06,041
I guess
it'll just have to be only Max.

207
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:16,166
Um, hey, I remember that you told me once

208
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:19,125
that no woman
has ever made your heart beat faster.

209
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:23,750
What about with a man?

210
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:32,541
Well, what were you doing there?

211
00:19:33,416 --> 00:19:34,833
I want a straight answer.

212
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:45,250
Well, it was an accident.

213
00:19:45,875 --> 00:19:49,333
I was trying
to find some really nice locations.

214
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:50,541
I just got lost.

215
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:51,541
Stop lying!

216
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:56,416
Do you understand what you did
was a serious violation of the rules?

217
00:19:57,291 --> 00:19:59,500
I have every right
to send you to The Farm,

218
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:01,125
and I promise you don't want that.

219
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:02,458
My brother is here!

220
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,500
My mom wants to meet him.

221
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:23,291
She said he was brought here
without her consent.

222
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:27,375
And she was confined,
tortured and drugged.

223
00:20:29,416 --> 00:20:33,208
All she wanted was to be with her son
and to watch him grow.

224
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:38,708
How did we become the ones
who were considered criminals?

225
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:48,291
There are reasons
why those rules are in place.

226
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:51,166
If you follow them, you're rewarded.

227
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:53,375
And punished if you don't.

228
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:56,833
If you can't understand
something so basic,

229
00:20:56,916 --> 00:20:58,708
you don't deserve to be here.

230
00:21:09,958 --> 00:21:11,291
Now get back to work.

231
00:21:15,291 --> 00:21:16,125
Hey?

232
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:18,833
We never had this conversation.

233
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:23,000
But if you do this again,

234
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:25,500
I'll send you to The Farm immediately.

235
00:21:26,625 --> 00:21:27,458
Understand?

236
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:55,916
<i>Why is God never on our side?</i>

237
00:21:56,958 --> 00:22:01,500
Despite all our efforts,
you're always made to suffer.

238
00:22:07,083 --> 00:22:10,666
Look at this as sending our son
to boarding school… or summer camp.

239
00:22:11,291 --> 00:22:13,958
And when he's of age, then we can see him.

240
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:16,333
The Farm is not a summer camp.

241
00:22:16,416 --> 00:22:17,708
And you know that.

242
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:27,708
You know, I heard that there's a group
who can help people like you and I.

243
00:22:28,875 --> 00:22:30,625
They're called City Ground.

244
00:22:31,375 --> 00:22:32,291
Stop this.

245
00:22:33,291 --> 00:22:36,958
You, of all people, know
how hard I worked to get to this point.

246
00:22:37,041 --> 00:22:39,916
I'm not going to sacrifice it all
for the sake of a child.

247
00:22:41,125 --> 00:22:43,958
Yes, but that child will be our child.

248
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:57,000
But we can try again
as many times as it takes.

249
00:22:57,708 --> 00:22:58,666
I'm good with that.

250
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:03,208
And when our son has reached legal age,
we'll go and visit him.

251
00:23:04,791 --> 00:23:06,750
That doesn't sound like a life.

252
00:23:10,958 --> 00:23:14,125
In the morning,
I'll inform the authorities.

253
00:23:14,958 --> 00:23:16,333
I'm the doctor.

254
00:23:16,416 --> 00:23:17,833
I think it's my responsibility.

255
00:23:18,583 --> 00:23:19,625
I'll take care of it.

256
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:40,958
Oh, you look so pretty, little sister.

257
00:23:41,041 --> 00:23:42,875
You're definitely slaying it, Queen.

258
00:23:44,583 --> 00:23:47,958
So you're saying
I could be one of The Ladies?

259
00:23:52,041 --> 00:23:53,041
Come on.

260
00:23:53,125 --> 00:23:55,125
Uh… Oh, hey!

261
00:24:01,041 --> 00:24:02,125
This way.

262
00:24:04,833 --> 00:24:06,333
-What are you doing?
-Shh!

263
00:24:21,375 --> 00:24:23,333
This is dangerous.

264
00:24:23,416 --> 00:24:26,541
So many guards patrolling
and cameras everywhere.

265
00:24:27,291 --> 00:24:28,416
Are we gonna make it?

266
00:24:31,416 --> 00:24:33,500
When the guards come back,

267
00:24:34,916 --> 00:24:37,333
those cameras will point the other way.

268
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:49,500
-Right. Follow me.
-Okay.

269
00:24:54,708 --> 00:24:56,708
-Come on. They're coming back.
-Oh!

270
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:02,208
Oof!

271
00:25:03,541 --> 00:25:04,708
Sorry, sorry.

272
00:25:05,333 --> 00:25:09,208
Hang on. How did you know
which way the cameras would face

273
00:25:09,291 --> 00:25:12,125
and when the guards
were going to come back?

274
00:25:14,166 --> 00:25:15,750
I've always had this plan…

275
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,666
but never the courage to do it.

276
00:25:22,875 --> 00:25:25,583
Think of it
as a challenge in the competition.

277
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:27,583
Ah!

278
00:25:28,458 --> 00:25:34,583
And now we're doing
a special game called Hide and Seek.

279
00:25:45,458 --> 00:25:48,583
Hey, you have to see this.
Oh, my God, they're so cute.

280
00:25:51,583 --> 00:25:53,291
They're gone. Come on.

281
00:25:56,333 --> 00:25:58,583
Oh, hold on!

282
00:25:58,666 --> 00:26:00,750
Just give me a minute.

283
00:26:00,833 --> 00:26:02,375
Are you okay?

284
00:26:02,458 --> 00:26:03,708
-Oh, quick.
-Oh!

285
00:26:18,166 --> 00:26:20,375
Huh? What? You okay?

286
00:26:27,583 --> 00:26:29,208
Tired. So tired.

287
00:26:30,916 --> 00:26:32,375
We got through the hard part.

288
00:26:33,041 --> 00:26:34,291
Now it's just the forest.

289
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,916
Okay, you ready? Great.

290
00:26:39,458 --> 00:26:41,958
Control yourself.

291
00:26:43,083 --> 00:26:44,458
Hey, wait for me.

292
00:26:51,875 --> 00:26:53,166
Oh!

293
00:26:55,541 --> 00:26:57,125
Blessed one! Blessed one! Blessed one!

294
00:26:57,208 --> 00:27:00,125
Hey, it's me. What are you doing here?

295
00:27:01,416 --> 00:27:02,250
Paper?!

296
00:27:03,166 --> 00:27:04,791
What the hell?

297
00:27:06,208 --> 00:27:09,083
Son, I followed your plan. It worked.

298
00:27:09,833 --> 00:27:12,458
I was like a shadow. Nobody saw me.

299
00:27:12,541 --> 00:27:13,750
Like you said.

300
00:27:19,875 --> 00:27:21,458
What on earth is this?

301
00:27:21,541 --> 00:27:22,833
Go back to your room.

302
00:27:22,916 --> 00:27:25,333
Oh, and what is that?

303
00:27:26,708 --> 00:27:28,166
You don't get to tell me off.

304
00:27:30,833 --> 00:27:34,041
Also… why are you two together?

305
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:36,333
Do you like her now?

306
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:41,750
I'm coming with.

307
00:27:41,833 --> 00:27:44,208
I don't want to hear
another word about it.

308
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:45,583
You can't.

309
00:27:45,666 --> 00:27:47,000
Huh? Why not?

310
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:49,625
Just let me tag along.

311
00:27:52,041 --> 00:27:54,458
I'm going to get out anyway.

312
00:27:54,541 --> 00:27:56,166
You heard me. Now go back.

313
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:58,125
-I'm not going back!
-No, you're going back.

314
00:27:58,208 --> 00:28:00,125
-No!
-Both of you, be quiet.

315
00:28:00,208 --> 00:28:03,166
Stop arguing or we'll get caught, okay?

316
00:28:03,791 --> 00:28:05,250
Hey, it's that way, right?

317
00:28:05,875 --> 00:28:06,791
Yeah.

318
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:17,458
-Come on, hurry up.
-Let's go!

It's the car from that ad we shot.

328
00:28:58,166 --> 00:29:00,125
Gosh, why are you so excited?

329
00:29:02,041 --> 00:29:03,416
Anytime, day or night…

330
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:05,416
…car rentals you can trust.

331
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,291
Eve Car Rental!

332
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:14,916
Gosh, they're like nerds
skipping school for the very first time.

333
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:18,291
-This time we get to drive it.
-Where should we go?

334
00:29:21,416 --> 00:29:24,125
Hey, gentlemen, are we going? Hm?

335
00:29:24,208 --> 00:29:26,958
How long are you gonna fanboy over it?

336
00:29:33,958 --> 00:29:35,875
Sorry for calling you so late.

337
00:29:36,458 --> 00:29:39,041
When I can't sleep, I like to cook.

338
00:29:39,791 --> 00:29:42,333
And you had said
you wanted more footage of me,

339
00:29:42,416 --> 00:29:43,791
so I thought I'd call you.

340
00:29:44,875 --> 00:29:47,708
Oh, that's okay.

341
00:29:51,083 --> 00:29:52,416
Mm.

342
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:56,666
It says on your profile that…

343
00:29:58,333 --> 00:30:02,666
your mother gave you to The Farm
with no intention of contacting you again.

344
00:30:03,958 --> 00:30:04,833
Yep.

345
00:30:11,041 --> 00:30:11,875
Well…

346
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,916
have you thought about your family?

347
00:30:18,083 --> 00:30:19,250
Nah.

348
00:30:22,125 --> 00:30:23,666
You must have heard that…

349
00:30:24,708 --> 00:30:28,541
family, it's more
than just blood and DNA, yeah?

350
00:30:30,833 --> 00:30:31,791
Huh?

351
00:30:32,833 --> 00:30:34,708
Even though my mom abandoned me,

352
00:30:35,291 --> 00:30:36,333
I understand.

353
00:30:37,375 --> 00:30:39,125
I know she had her reasons.

354
00:30:40,708 --> 00:30:42,208
But I grew up with those guys.

355
00:30:43,041 --> 00:30:43,916
It was great.

356
00:30:44,708 --> 00:30:48,458
My brothers and I,
we've got it pretty good here, you know?

357
00:30:49,791 --> 00:30:50,750
For me,

358
00:30:51,791 --> 00:30:53,916
The Gentlemen are my family and…

359
00:30:55,041 --> 00:30:57,541
The Farm is my home.

360
00:31:15,375 --> 00:31:18,958
And what if your biological family
hadn't intended to give you up?

361
00:31:19,041 --> 00:31:20,166
Had been trying to find you?

362
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:21,666
I'd prefer that they didn't.

363
00:31:23,875 --> 00:31:27,208
Because if they did contact me,

364
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,500
they'd be breaking the law.

365
00:31:31,083 --> 00:31:33,583
I wouldn't want them getting into trouble.

366
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,166
I'm happy here.

367
00:31:42,125 --> 00:31:43,291
Stop here.

368
00:31:48,708 --> 00:31:50,125
Okay, take care, Paper.

369
00:31:50,208 --> 00:31:51,666
-We'll see you later.
-Mm. Mm.

370
00:31:52,958 --> 00:31:54,750
-Hey.
-Mm?

371
00:31:55,458 --> 00:31:59,083
You guys… are you on a date together?

372
00:32:03,958 --> 00:32:08,250
Anyway, at least you're not being followed
by a camera team.

373
00:32:12,083 --> 00:32:15,416
Oh, come on.
Are you nuts? We're not on a date.

374
00:32:15,958 --> 00:32:17,458
This would be, uh…

375
00:32:18,458 --> 00:32:20,791
two friends on a cool getaway.

376
00:32:20,875 --> 00:32:22,541
Yeah. Isn't that right, huh?

377
00:32:28,375 --> 00:32:30,125
Okay. All right then.

378
00:32:31,083 --> 00:32:32,083
See you later.

379
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,333
See you.

380
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:45,583

Listen up.

402
00:34:35,333 --> 00:34:37,291
This is a kidnapping.

403
00:34:42,291 --> 00:34:43,291
Chun?

404
00:34:52,333 --> 00:34:53,958
Here you go.

405
00:34:54,041 --> 00:34:55,458
Okay!

406
00:34:55,541 --> 00:34:57,541
Ah!

407
00:34:58,083 --> 00:34:59,625
Hello again.

408
00:35:02,208 --> 00:35:04,291
VISIT LADY LOTTO'S FAVORITE RESTAURANT

409
00:35:10,666 --> 00:35:11,625
Looks like her.

410
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:22,291
Oh, excuse me.

411
00:35:24,458 --> 00:35:26,583
Mm!

412
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:34,958
Mm.

413
00:35:37,166 --> 00:35:39,500
You sound like
you've never had one of these.

414
00:35:41,583 --> 00:35:42,708
Ooh!

415
00:35:46,166 --> 00:35:48,583
Mm… Of course not.

416
00:35:51,833 --> 00:35:53,416
Look at this lean body.

417
00:35:55,333 --> 00:35:56,291
And the perfect skin.

418
00:35:56,916 --> 00:35:59,250
Of course, I've never had this stuff.

419
00:36:02,583 --> 00:36:04,166
Is this who he really is?

420
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:09,958
It's fizzy.

421
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:13,916
Oh!

422
00:36:18,333 --> 00:36:19,625
I live by a schedule.

423
00:36:20,458 --> 00:36:22,000
I eat what my dietitian says,

424
00:36:22,583 --> 00:36:24,083
exercise with a trainer,

425
00:36:24,875 --> 00:36:27,500
and my teachers are PhD qualified.

426
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:31,625
If I get sick,
a team of doctors looks after me.

427
00:36:32,791 --> 00:36:34,791
Yep, my life.

428
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:39,750
Ooh, what's that? Mussels?

429
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:49,083
What's this?

430
00:36:50,416 --> 00:36:52,125
You know, I think we should be leaving.

431
00:36:52,208 --> 00:36:53,375
Mm-hm.

432
00:36:53,458 --> 00:36:56,000
-We've gotta go. Just leave it. Come on.
-What?

433
00:36:57,041 --> 00:36:58,666
Where should we go next?

434
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:00,500
Hold on, let me think.

435
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:10,416
So good-looking.

436
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,333
Huh?

437
00:37:40,625 --> 00:37:42,208
Are you really right in front of me?

438
00:37:52,291 --> 00:37:54,625
Wow, you're beautiful.

439
00:38:05,416 --> 00:38:06,750
We finally meet.

440
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:16,416
Whoa!

441
00:38:18,458 --> 00:38:19,833
Whoa.

442
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,333
Oh, it's incredible.

443
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:29,875
Where am I?

444
00:38:31,583 --> 00:38:34,416
This is my place.

445
00:38:36,583 --> 00:38:38,708
And the headquarters of City Ground.

446
00:38:40,291 --> 00:38:41,875
Sorry for blindfolding you.

447
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,666
This is a secret location.

448
00:38:49,041 --> 00:38:50,416
A secret place.

449
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,416
You're part of City Ground?

450
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:56,833
Can I get you a beer?

451
00:38:57,541 --> 00:38:58,416
Oh!

452
00:39:04,958 --> 00:39:05,833
That's right.

453
00:39:06,333 --> 00:39:07,375
You don't drink.

454
00:39:08,291 --> 00:39:10,750
Give it here.
Do you want a soda or something?

455
00:39:11,833 --> 00:39:13,375
I'm old enough to drink.

456
00:39:33,291 --> 00:39:35,125
So tell me about yourself.

457
00:39:36,208 --> 00:39:37,708
And City Ground.

458
00:39:37,791 --> 00:39:39,125
I want to know the truth.

459
00:39:48,166 --> 00:39:49,583
Then let's start…

460
00:39:51,833 --> 00:39:53,208
with what you know already.

461
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:03,875
TOFU CUPCAKE

462
00:40:04,833 --> 00:40:06,625
Tofu Cupcake.

463
00:40:07,333 --> 00:40:09,500
Here you go, Son. Some water.

464
00:40:09,583 --> 00:40:11,166
Oh, thanks very much.

465
00:40:12,916 --> 00:40:15,625
Hm, I've never met someone famous.

466
00:40:16,333 --> 00:40:19,416
Uh, I'm sorry that my house is messy.

467
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,958
I heard you're a fan of mine, so thanks.

468
00:40:27,916 --> 00:40:31,541
Uh, yeah, I've changed.
I was a fan of yours.

469
00:40:33,375 --> 00:40:34,833
But now I'm a fan of Day's.

470
00:40:35,958 --> 00:40:38,083
Oh, I see.

471
00:40:41,791 --> 00:40:42,708
Um…

472
00:40:50,916 --> 00:40:52,041
Is this your cat?

473
00:40:52,583 --> 00:40:53,458
Not really.

474
00:40:54,125 --> 00:40:56,583
I just feed
some of the neighborhood feral cats

475
00:40:57,333 --> 00:41:00,333
because Day told me she once had a cat…

476
00:41:01,041 --> 00:41:02,708
called Meow Meow.

477
00:41:05,541 --> 00:41:08,708
And one day it disappeared.

478
00:41:09,916 --> 00:41:11,833
She told me she cried so hard

479
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:14,666
and she spent months trying to find it.

480
00:41:15,833 --> 00:41:18,208
She loved it very much.

481
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:22,791
Meow Meow, Meow Meow, where are you?

482
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,541
And so since then

483
00:41:30,291 --> 00:41:33,916
we just… have never had a cat.

484
00:41:35,708 --> 00:41:39,750
Day said she's too scared
of losing something like that again.

485
00:41:39,833 --> 00:41:43,875
My sister always likes to look
like she's the toughest.

486
00:41:44,708 --> 00:41:49,000
Except, actually, she's not at all,
you know.

487
00:41:49,791 --> 00:41:51,583
She's really soft-hearted.

488
00:41:55,208 --> 00:41:57,125
What's going on here?

489
00:41:58,583 --> 00:42:01,750
May, were you guys gossiping about me?

490
00:42:02,666 --> 00:42:04,333
Of course we were.

491
00:42:05,416 --> 00:42:07,541
Well, what were you saying?

492
00:42:08,583 --> 00:42:09,416
Mm-mm.

493
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:10,958
So what do you think?

494
00:42:11,041 --> 00:42:12,625
He's here? You satisfied?

495
00:42:18,791 --> 00:42:20,875
Hm, you're blushing a little.

496
00:42:24,583 --> 00:42:25,708
You know…

497
00:42:27,250 --> 00:42:30,375
I've worked out where I'd like to go.

498
00:42:32,041 --> 00:42:34,416
Actually, you look good
with a wig on.

499
00:42:38,250 --> 00:42:39,125
Really?

500
00:42:40,708 --> 00:42:42,708
-Son?
-Hm?

501
00:42:42,791 --> 00:42:45,708
What if I came first on <i>Ready, Set, Love</i>

502
00:42:45,791 --> 00:42:48,208
and I picked you in the end?

503
00:42:48,291 --> 00:42:49,458
What would you say?

504
00:42:50,833 --> 00:42:51,958
Impossible.

505
00:42:52,041 --> 00:42:53,375
Hey, wait a minute.

506
00:42:54,083 --> 00:42:55,375
What do you mean by that?

507
00:42:56,083 --> 00:42:58,833
You mean I can't?
You think I'm not capable?

508
00:42:59,583 --> 00:43:02,500
-Oh, that's not it at all.
-Oh, right.

509
00:43:02,583 --> 00:43:06,291
So you're worried I might pick you
because maybe…

510
00:43:07,458 --> 00:43:10,375
you have your eye on somebody else?

511
00:43:14,291 --> 00:43:15,875
Wait. Hey.

512
00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:18,458
What would you say

513
00:43:19,083 --> 00:43:20,291
if I told you that…

514
00:43:22,166 --> 00:43:24,416
<i>Ready, Set, Love </i>is just a fancy advert

515
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,333
and that all the games and results,

516
00:43:30,875 --> 00:43:32,708
the whole thing is fixed?

517
00:43:35,791 --> 00:43:36,750
What?

518
00:43:37,625 --> 00:43:39,291
There's no way.

519
00:43:46,375 --> 00:43:47,458
What it means is…

520
00:43:52,375 --> 00:43:54,666
no matter how you and I feel

521
00:43:55,625 --> 00:43:57,375
or how hard we try to be together…

522
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,125
in the end…

523
00:44:01,583 --> 00:44:05,333
something will be put in place
that won't let us win.

524
00:44:17,250 --> 00:44:20,291
Well, it is, you know,
the entertainment industry.

525
00:44:21,125 --> 00:44:24,375
I suppose, of course,
reality TV is all scripted.

526
00:44:24,458 --> 00:44:25,750
Yeah, and I guess…

527
00:44:26,708 --> 00:44:29,416
that means you know
who you'll end up with, right?

528
00:44:40,708 --> 00:44:44,583
<i>Do you even realize</i>
<i>that everything I do is for you?</i>

529
00:44:45,875 --> 00:44:48,291
<i>You will not fail again. Am I clear?</i>

530
00:45:07,833 --> 00:45:08,666
Hey, you.

531
00:45:10,666 --> 00:45:12,166
I've been watching you swim.

532
00:45:13,833 --> 00:45:15,666
Training for the Olympics?

533
00:45:20,791 --> 00:45:22,625
I thought I'd been really clear.

534
00:45:27,250 --> 00:45:29,083
Why does it have to be Son?

535
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:37,083
I guess
I only like things that are the best.

536
00:45:40,791 --> 00:45:42,166
-Oh!
-Is that funny?

537
00:45:43,166 --> 00:45:45,166
All right.

538
00:45:45,833 --> 00:45:46,958
Tell you what.

539
00:45:47,833 --> 00:45:49,000
Let's keep this polite.

540
00:45:50,708 --> 00:45:52,583
Then if you really don't like me,

541
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:54,708
I'll leave you alone.

542
00:45:58,208 --> 00:46:00,333
Come on, that's more than fair.

543
00:46:20,541 --> 00:46:22,458
-Hey.
-Hm?

544
00:46:22,541 --> 00:46:25,000
-Do you come back here very often?
-Yeah.

545
00:46:26,541 --> 00:46:27,958
MAY
DAY

546
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:38,375
This place is where I come
to get away from it all.

547
00:46:48,083 --> 00:46:49,208
It's the same.

548
00:46:54,125 --> 00:46:55,333
Here.

549
00:46:55,416 --> 00:46:58,541
That night, Son's face was all swollen.

550
00:46:59,416 --> 00:47:01,875
-Really?
-Mm. He'd had some teeth out.

551
00:47:01,958 --> 00:47:04,458
And I thought it would be so funny

552
00:47:04,541 --> 00:47:08,916
to draw on his face, take a picture
and then put it on socials.

553
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,166
I was kind of a troll.

554
00:47:10,250 --> 00:47:11,708
I remember that.

555
00:47:11,791 --> 00:47:17,041
The photo went viral
with the hashtag #sonthecutierabbit

556
00:47:17,125 --> 00:47:19,208
It did. It trended globally.

557
00:47:19,291 --> 00:47:23,625
I was mad. So mad
I didn't sleep the next three nights.

558
00:47:26,750 --> 00:47:29,041
With Son, it doesn't matter.

559
00:47:29,125 --> 00:47:31,541
He's always the star.

560
00:47:34,250 --> 00:47:37,458
And for me, no matter how hard I try,

561
00:47:39,375 --> 00:47:40,750
I am just the backup.

562
00:47:45,291 --> 00:47:46,708
Life can be so unfair.

563
00:47:57,166 --> 00:47:58,625
It's exhausting, isn't it?

564
00:47:59,916 --> 00:48:01,083
Trying so hard

565
00:48:01,833 --> 00:48:05,250
but no matter what you do,
never being good enough.

566
00:48:11,125 --> 00:48:12,041
You're cute.

567
00:48:18,666 --> 00:48:20,416
I can't look away.

568
00:48:21,916 --> 00:48:23,708
Cheers.

569
00:48:33,416 --> 00:48:36,083
I guess I'll have to keep trying.

570
00:48:36,166 --> 00:48:37,791
Cheers again.

571
00:48:42,041 --> 00:48:45,333
You sure… you should have that much?

572
00:48:45,958 --> 00:48:48,000
Um, Well, it's sweet. I like it.

573
00:48:48,083 --> 00:48:48,916
Oh.

574
00:48:50,416 --> 00:48:51,250
To your health.

575
00:48:52,291 --> 00:48:53,125
Uh…

576
00:49:02,041 --> 00:49:02,875
Um…

577
00:49:03,625 --> 00:49:07,750
I know that City Ground
was a group that resisted The Farm

578
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:12,083
and took on the government until…

579
00:49:13,625 --> 00:49:15,000
they were purged.

580
00:49:15,916 --> 00:49:16,750
Hm.

581
00:49:17,916 --> 00:49:21,583
The truth is,
our families were taken away.

582
00:49:23,083 --> 00:49:24,750
Our rights had been taken.

583
00:49:26,375 --> 00:49:28,583
And we're fighting to get them back.

584
00:49:34,333 --> 00:49:35,750
13 years ago…

585
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:40,250
we'd made a plan
to save a group from The Farm.

586
00:49:45,625 --> 00:49:46,833
And when it failed,

587
00:49:48,583 --> 00:49:50,583
the men were taken back to The Farm.

588
00:49:52,166 --> 00:49:53,750
Only a few made it out

589
00:49:55,125 --> 00:49:57,041
and City Ground was purged.

590
00:49:58,750 --> 00:50:00,750
We've been underground since then.

591
00:50:09,208 --> 00:50:12,375
<i>They said it was to protect us</i>
<i>from human trafficking.</i>

592
00:50:13,833 --> 00:50:15,041
They lied.

593
00:50:15,125 --> 00:50:16,791
Because it's really a system,

594
00:50:16,875 --> 00:50:20,000
a system that keeps men as property
for the wealthy elite.

595
00:50:21,416 --> 00:50:23,541
<i>Ready, Set, Love </i>is just propaganda

596
00:50:24,208 --> 00:50:26,583
designed to make us think we're free.

597
00:50:27,625 --> 00:50:28,541
And equal.

598
00:50:29,041 --> 00:50:33,041
But all the past Ladies,
their families paid huge bribes.

599
00:50:34,166 --> 00:50:37,333
This new lotto system
was just introduced…

600
00:50:38,791 --> 00:50:40,791
to try and hide the corruption.

601
00:50:46,708 --> 00:50:50,625
So are the other Gentlemen, you know,

602
00:50:50,708 --> 00:50:52,541
aware that the results are fixed?

603
00:50:58,083 --> 00:50:59,041
I hope not.

604
00:51:02,250 --> 00:51:04,666
If I didn't visit Chanel's house so often,

605
00:51:06,375 --> 00:51:07,958
I wouldn't know either.

606
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:12,875
And…

607
00:51:14,416 --> 00:51:16,250
the reason I didn't tell anyone…

608
00:51:17,625 --> 00:51:19,375
I didn't want my friends

609
00:51:21,666 --> 00:51:23,125
to feel this hopeless.

610
00:51:23,958 --> 00:51:25,833
<i>The mothers who resisted</i>

611
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:30,791
were jailed and forcibly sedated?

612
00:51:32,791 --> 00:51:34,875
They were either re-educated

613
00:51:34,958 --> 00:51:37,791
or we never saw them again.

614
00:51:40,583 --> 00:51:43,166
No way. I don't believe it.

615
00:51:44,583 --> 00:51:47,791
I've lived my life on The Farm,
why have I never heard anything?

616
00:51:48,416 --> 00:51:52,250
I've lived my life with City Ground.
These things really do happen.

617
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:54,916
It's not a story.

618
00:51:57,625 --> 00:51:58,916
What about me?

619
00:52:00,166 --> 00:52:03,541
My mom gave me over to The Farm
of her own free will.

620
00:52:04,708 --> 00:52:07,208
I've heard enough. I don't believe you.

621
00:52:07,291 --> 00:52:08,375
Did she?

622
00:52:10,291 --> 00:52:11,291
What do you think?

623
00:52:12,083 --> 00:52:15,791
How many mothers
would give away their children?

624
00:52:17,375 --> 00:52:18,541
You're from The Farm.

625
00:52:19,750 --> 00:52:21,250
You never had a mom,

626
00:52:22,250 --> 00:52:23,583
but I did.

627
00:52:25,041 --> 00:52:28,166
Some mothers, they got pressured.

628
00:52:29,041 --> 00:52:31,625
Some were paid for their children.

629
00:52:33,625 --> 00:52:34,666
But my mother…

630
00:52:36,750 --> 00:52:38,875
and the moms of City Ground…

631
00:52:40,916 --> 00:52:42,750
sacrificed everything…

632
00:52:45,333 --> 00:52:46,791
so that we could…

633
00:52:48,958 --> 00:52:50,000
be free.

634
00:52:58,541 --> 00:52:59,541
Okay.

635
00:53:00,375 --> 00:53:01,541
What are you saying?

636
00:53:03,208 --> 00:53:04,583
Are you trying to tell me…

637
00:53:07,291 --> 00:53:10,041
my mom is in jail right now?

638
00:53:12,333 --> 00:53:13,875
Or even worse?

639
00:53:16,250 --> 00:53:19,958
Listening to this, I feel… I don't know.

640
00:53:20,041 --> 00:53:22,083
I'm so depressed and sad.

641
00:53:22,166 --> 00:53:23,208
It's like…

642
00:53:24,458 --> 00:53:26,000
If everyone knew about it,

643
00:53:26,625 --> 00:53:28,583
imagine what they'd think.

644
00:53:35,708 --> 00:53:37,125
<i>These things take time.</i>

645
00:53:38,583 --> 00:53:40,083
You grew up in that place.

646
00:53:55,750 --> 00:53:57,333
Okay, that's enough.

647
00:53:58,916 --> 00:54:00,708
Hey, give it a rest, will you?

648
00:54:02,708 --> 00:54:05,583
I'm a grown man. I can do what I want!

649
00:54:12,291 --> 00:54:13,416
Oh, yeah?

650
00:54:14,708 --> 00:54:15,875
You are a man.

651
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,166
So I guess…

652
00:54:22,458 --> 00:54:24,333

when I realized my fate,

666
00:55:48,583 --> 00:55:49,791
