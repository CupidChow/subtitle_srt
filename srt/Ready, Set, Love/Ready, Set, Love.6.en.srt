1
00:00:12,166 --> 00:00:16,916
Are you aware
that you're the highest-rated Lady

2
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,333
in the history of <i>Ready, Set, Love?</i>

3
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:28,708
The reason you're competing in this show
is because your sister is ill?

4
00:00:30,791 --> 00:00:31,666
Uh, yes.

5
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:35,791
Well, what I'm about to say

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,833
will be very good news then.

7
00:00:45,166 --> 00:00:47,416
<i>Surprise! Look at this, Day.</i>

8
00:00:48,166 --> 00:00:50,833
<i>I've been moved to a new room.</i>
<i>Isn't it nice?</i>

9
00:00:50,916 --> 00:00:53,875
<i>The bed's amazing.</i>
<i>It's really comfortable.</i>

10
00:00:53,958 --> 00:00:57,000
<i>There's even a new teddy bear in here.</i>
<i>It's so cute.</i>

11
00:00:57,791 --> 00:00:59,541
<i>Look at this. Ah!</i>

12
00:01:00,666 --> 00:01:01,583
May.

13
00:01:03,166 --> 00:01:06,250
<i>Eve Capital is taking care</i>
<i>of May's medical expenses?</i>

14
00:01:08,375 --> 00:01:09,791
May looked so happy

15
00:01:10,625 --> 00:01:12,666
boasting about her VIP room.

16
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:17,000
She has no idea she's a hostage.

17
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:25,916

Ready, Set, Love.

56
00:04:55,666 --> 00:05:01,458
And this season's ratings have been
the……grea--

57
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:04,041
…grea--

58
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:06,166
-That's enough of that.
-The greatest of all time.

59
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:07,541
Who is the favorite?

60
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:09,958
It's hard to say who will win the game.

61
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:12,125
But if there's one contestant
who stands out,

62
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:13,500
it's gotta be Chanel, right?

63
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:15,833
<i>She and Son</i>
<i>have been dating a few weeks now,</i>

64
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:18,458
<i>and they have been very lovey-dovey.</i>

65
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:22,541
Another contestant to consider
is our Lotto Girl, Day.

66
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:25,083
<i>She's been on several dates with Al…</i>

67
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:29,083
Al… Al… Al…

68
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:30,458
-Al…
-Mond!

69
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:32,500
Almond…

70
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:34,791
<i>and hasn't chosen anyone else since.</i>

71
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:37,666
<i>I think it's safe to say</i>
<i>she's found her Mr. Right.</i>

72
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:46,875
Oh!

73
00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:48,833
Doctor.

74
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,166
How is May?

75
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:54,666
The operation was a success.
She's in recovery now.

76
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:13,416
Day?

77
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:17,666
May.

78
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:20,500
Oh, easy.

79
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:29,166
Hey, Day, why didn't you pick Son
for your date?

80
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:43,833
It's okay.

81
00:06:44,583 --> 00:06:46,166
I'm fine now.

82
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:51,500
But can you please let go?

83
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:54,333
I'm still in pain.

84
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,500
Of course, it's painful.

85
00:06:58,041 --> 00:06:59,875
Sorry. Sorry.

86
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:02,000
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

87
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:07,958
<i>As </i>Ready, Set, Love
<i>enters its final stretch,</i>

88
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:12,625
let's take a moment to remember The Ladies
who were made to pack up and get out.

89
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:17,708
<i>Only five Ladies remain</i>

90
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:21,458
<i>for what promises to be</i>
<i>an incredible final round.</i>

91
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:59,291
-Come back here.
-Daddy's gonna get you.

92
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:01,500
Here you are. I got you now.

93
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:05,583
Hi!

94
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:17,541
Hold on tight. Here we go.

95
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:20,833
Higher!

96
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,375
Is this…

97
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:45,500
our future house?

98
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:55,625
I know that this hasn't all gone
the way you thought it would.

99
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:58,500
And I also know

100
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:01,208
that you're in love with Son.

101
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:16,166
What I'm hoping

102
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:18,541
is that you'll give me a chance.

103
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:24,208
Maybe you don't see me that way.

104
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:27,708
But no matter what…

105
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:33,458
from now on…

106
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,916
I'm gonna take care
of you and your sister.

107
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:42,083
I don't know
if you'll change your mind someday…

108
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:46,958
but I hope so.

109
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:04,958
Sorry. I don't mean to be dramatic.

110
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:08,458
They'll want to take some footage.

111
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:10,958
Should we get ready?

112
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:14,166
Okay.

113
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,458
You hungry?

114
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:18,375
I'll cook something.

115
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:20,083
Great idea.

116
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:34,541
Can I help with anything?

117
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,833
Know how to prep bacon?

118
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:40,666
Oh. Well, no, but I'll try.

119
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,000
-So let's see.
-Okay.

120
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:43,833
-Uh, this one here?
-Yeah.

121
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:45,708
Okay.

122
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:47,833
-Like this?
-Yep.

123
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:52,000
-I know what this is called.
-It's Thai Basil.

124
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:52,958
Did I get it right?

125
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:55,500
-It's Sweet Basil.
-It's Sweet Basil, okay.

126
00:10:57,166 --> 00:10:58,833
You know, I heard today

127
00:10:58,916 --> 00:11:02,208
that the tickets for the final round
sold out in five minutes.

128
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:04,000
They did.

129
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:07,291
I'll admit it was clever of you

130
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,750
to keep the Lotto Girl in the game.

131
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:14,375
The people need hope they can win.

132
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:19,291
Even though the result
has already been determined.

133
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:22,458
Oh, by the way…

134
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:26,458
what sex is it?

135
00:11:28,916 --> 00:11:29,750
Pardon?

136
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,625
The child you're carrying.

137
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:36,000
Don't try to deny it. I can tell.

138
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:39,083
We don't know yet.

139
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:43,750
Well, let's hope it's a male.

140
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:48,125
Cheers.

141
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,708
Babe, what should we have for dinner?

142
00:12:09,875 --> 00:12:11,833
Babe? What's the matter?

143
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:26,041
-Here, take this.
-Yeah, thanks.

144
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:27,333
-Oh, I'm so tired.
-Me too.

145
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:28,666
I'm starving.

146
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,750
-Let's get some barbecue.
-Yes!

147
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:33,291
-Yum. Which place?
-So hungry!

148
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:35,375
<i>Oh, God, Val, it was exhausting.</i>

149
00:12:58,166 --> 00:12:59,041
<i>How are you?</i>

150
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:02,125
I'm good.

151
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:03,708
What about you?

152
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,500
I miss you.

153
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:19,541
Well, we see each other all the time.

154
00:13:22,916 --> 00:13:24,041
Yeah, I guess.

155
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:28,958
I always thought
that not seeing the person I love,

156
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:31,458
would be the hardest.

157
00:13:32,916 --> 00:13:35,708
It turns out
that seeing them all the time,

158
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,833
always just out of reach,

159
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:41,750
is much worse.

160
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:46,000
Is that dramatic?

161
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:51,291
Yes.

162
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:53,125
So dramatic.

163
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:13,583
And yet I understand.

164
00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:19,750
It's hard when I see you as well.

165
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:29,791
You know what would be the greatest?

166
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:34,708
You and I together.

167
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:45,208
Psst!

168
00:14:57,708 --> 00:14:59,750
What? Stray cats these days?

169
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:06,875
Meow.

170
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:09,666
Damn.

171
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:12,458
Oh, my gosh. Are you okay? I'm sorry.

172
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:15,541
That was a stupid prank.

173
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:18,958
Who would have guessed
you'd punch like that?

174
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:23,958
Why are you in my backyard?

175
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:34,291
I came here because after this…

176
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:36,833
that's it.

177
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:40,125
I won't see you again.

178
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:43,791
So…

179
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,791
-I came to say…
-To say goodbye.

180
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:48,125
To say I love you.

181
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:04,916
I might not have what Son has…

182
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:08,791
but I'll say this…

183
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:12,000
You'll be happier with me.

184
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:17,250
I have no idea how to convince you…

185
00:16:19,291 --> 00:16:20,625
but at the end…

186
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:24,916
choose me.

187
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:32,458
I'll say it again,

188
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:35,291
I will choose Son.

189
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:44,375
I don't know how many times
I've told you that.

190
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:48,125
Really?

191
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:51,375
You've told me two times.

192
00:16:58,708 --> 00:17:01,208
There's only one thing I've ever wanted.

193
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:04,875
And that's Son.

194
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:09,333
Acknowledgment.

195
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:14,166
From my mother.

196
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:22,958
Since I was little,

197
00:17:25,083 --> 00:17:25,916
I…

198
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:30,166
I've always tried to be
the best at everything.

199
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,500
Just hoping my mother… would approve.

200
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:48,083
What I never realized
was that I was born wrong.

201
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:53,416
She… only wanted a male child.

202
00:17:58,625 --> 00:17:59,708
You know what?

203
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:04,291
She did finally
say the thing I wanted to hear.

204
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:06,291
<i>Chanel…</i>

205
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:10,333
you and Son seemed to get along well.

206
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:12,541
Yes.

207
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:16,250
I must say you've done well.

208
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:19,083
You have lived up to my name.

209
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:36,875
I had waited my whole life

210
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:39,375
to hear those words from her.

211
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,041
<i>But when I actually heard them…</i>

212
00:18:51,541 --> 00:18:53,041
I just felt empty.

213
00:18:59,916 --> 00:19:00,750
So…

214
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,875
what have I been doing
all this for anyway?

215
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:49,583
Valentine?

216
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:52,541
<i>Requesting backup.</i>
<i>We have an intruder.</i>

217
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:45,791
Hi, Val, you're okay!

218
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:47,708
What happened?

219
00:20:47,791 --> 00:20:49,375
Sorry you waited so long.

220
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,708
Now I'm back.

221
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:53,583
She's back.

222
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:02,333
We're going to execute the plan
in the last round.

223
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:04,541
Hm.

224
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:33,500
Ten, nine,

225
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:36,458
eight, seven,

226
00:21:37,208 --> 00:21:38,208
six,

227
00:21:39,166 --> 00:21:41,375
five, five, five!

228
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:46,958
Hello!

229
00:21:47,583 --> 00:21:48,833
Welcome, everyone to the…

230
00:21:48,916 --> 00:21:52,333
<i>Ready, Set, Love </i>final round.

231
00:21:52,416 --> 00:21:56,375
The game we're playing today
is called Say I Do!

232
00:21:58,333 --> 00:22:00,000
CHANEL - BOVY
FIGHT ON, DAY!

233
00:22:01,208 --> 00:22:03,458
<i>Here comes a giant wedding cake.</i>

234
00:22:03,541 --> 00:22:06,625
<i>The theme of our final game</i>
<i>is chutes and ladders.</i>

235
00:22:06,708 --> 00:22:09,750
The <i>Ladies will have to make their way</i>
<i>up each level</i>

236
00:22:09,833 --> 00:22:12,416
<i>to The Gentlemen waiting at the top.</i>

237
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:15,250
<i>The cake is actually transparent,</i>

238
00:22:15,333 --> 00:22:18,208
<i>so the audience won't miss out</i>
<i>on any of the action.</i>

239
00:22:25,708 --> 00:22:27,625
Welcome and good evening!

240
00:22:27,708 --> 00:22:31,750
Let's kick things off by finding out
how each of our grooms to be…

241
00:22:31,833 --> 00:22:32,708
FIGHT ON, SON!

242
00:22:32,791 --> 00:22:33,708
…are feeling tonight.

243
00:22:33,791 --> 00:22:35,541
We'll start with Son.

244
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:37,583
Okay.

245
00:22:39,708 --> 00:22:41,333
Well, I'm excited.

246
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:49,291
Son, snappy, to the point and minimal.

247
00:22:49,375 --> 00:22:51,166
That's just classic Son, yep.

248
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:53,291
We'll go to Almond now.

249
00:22:54,166 --> 00:22:59,958
Yeah. Um, I'd like to say good luck
to all of The Ladies in the game.

250
00:23:00,833 --> 00:23:05,125
No matter what happens tonight,
you're all amazing.

251
00:23:12,291 --> 00:23:14,166
I think it's safe to say that

252
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:17,291
our betrothed would like
to see the brides now.

253
00:23:18,083 --> 00:23:20,666
And I know all of you
would like to see them.

254
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:22,791
Are you ready, gentlemen?

255
00:23:22,875 --> 00:23:24,041
I'm ready.

256
00:23:24,125 --> 00:23:25,958
Then, without further delay,

257
00:23:26,041 --> 00:23:30,666
let's hear a warm welcome
for our finalists, The Ladies.

258
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:40,416
First up, we have the one and only heiress
of Eve Capital.

259
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:44,791
She's the multi-talented wonder girl
who has melted the heart of…

260
00:23:45,416 --> 00:23:46,291
Son.

261
00:23:46,375 --> 00:23:49,000
Please make her welcome. Here she is.

262
00:23:49,083 --> 00:23:49,916
Chanel!

263
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,625
LOVE CHANEL
GO FOR IT, CHANEL

264
00:23:55,500 --> 00:24:01,250
Next up, we have the sweet style idol
with a million likes and followers,

265
00:24:01,333 --> 00:24:05,166
heiress to the city's most elegant
five-star hotel…

266
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:06,333
<i>Hi, Day.</i>

267
00:24:07,625 --> 00:24:09,250
May, how are you doing?

268
00:24:09,333 --> 00:24:11,166
I'm good. Don't worry, okay?

269
00:24:12,291 --> 00:24:14,750
They've got doctors here,
and I'm doing just fine.

270
00:24:15,416 --> 00:24:18,666
<i>-City Ground is kinda cool.</i>
-Okay.

271
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:20,875
<i>Hey, Day?</i>

272
00:24:23,291 --> 00:24:26,208
I am so sorry…

273
00:24:31,291 --> 00:24:32,125
that…

274
00:24:33,208 --> 00:24:36,083
because of me
you can't pick the one you love.

275
00:24:36,166 --> 00:24:37,916
May.

276
00:24:38,708 --> 00:24:40,291
<i>Since I was small,</i>

277
00:24:41,583 --> 00:24:45,208
I've been nothing but a burden.

278
00:24:46,041 --> 00:24:48,416
<i>You haven't been able</i>
<i>to do the things you want</i>

279
00:24:49,708 --> 00:24:51,916
<i>because you've had to take care of me.</i>

280
00:24:53,666 --> 00:24:56,916
I think your life, if I wasn't here,

281
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,291
<i>would have been a better life.</i>

282
00:25:00,041 --> 00:25:02,708
May, you're wrong about that.

283
00:25:03,416 --> 00:25:04,916
<i>You're my inspiration.</i>

284
00:25:05,666 --> 00:25:08,000
When I'm feeling down or discouraged

285
00:25:08,666 --> 00:25:11,750
the one person
who always makes me feel better

286
00:25:11,833 --> 00:25:13,416
is you, May, okay?

287
00:25:14,666 --> 00:25:16,500
<i>You're fighting your own battle</i>.

288
00:25:17,833 --> 00:25:20,250
And your fight isn't one that you started.

289
00:25:21,875 --> 00:25:25,833
But through all of it, May,
you've stayed so cheerful,

290
00:25:25,916 --> 00:25:27,208
<i>so strong.</i>

291
00:25:29,291 --> 00:25:31,500
I love you heaps, Day.

292
00:25:32,083 --> 00:25:33,666
<i>Now, don't worry about me.</i>

293
00:25:34,333 --> 00:25:35,916
<i>I'll take care of myself</i>

294
00:25:36,875 --> 00:25:39,000
<i>and I won't be a burden anymore.</i>

295
00:25:41,208 --> 00:25:43,916
Please go
and choose the life that you want.

296
00:25:45,125 --> 00:25:48,208
<i>I will be here cheering the loudest.</i>

297
00:25:48,833 --> 00:25:50,041
Just like always.

298
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:54,041
Ms. Day, it's time.

299
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:58,208
<i>It's time</i>
<i>to meet the last Lady tonight.</i>

300
00:25:58,291 --> 00:25:59,416
<i>She's a fighter</i>

301
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:03,875
who has done everything,
overcome each challenge for her sister.

302
00:26:04,666 --> 00:26:07,500
Though she came to be on this show
by chance,

303
00:26:07,583 --> 00:26:09,958
she has managed to show us

304
00:26:10,041 --> 00:26:12,750
that anyone can follow their dreams.

305
00:26:13,666 --> 00:26:19,291
She's been our real life Cinderella
on this season of <i>Ready, Set, Love.</i>

306
00:26:19,833 --> 00:26:23,458
Get ready because the time has come.
Send her out.

307
00:26:23,541 --> 00:26:26,916
Here she is, it's Day!

308
00:26:32,666 --> 00:26:33,916
DAY - GO, LOTTO GIRL

309
00:26:55,625 --> 00:26:57,625
<i>You have to win the last game.</i>

310
00:26:59,583 --> 00:27:00,458
Why?

311
00:27:00,541 --> 00:27:02,458
Is it part of our plan?

312
00:27:02,541 --> 00:27:03,375
<i>No.</i>

313
00:27:05,458 --> 00:27:07,208
I just want you to get out there

314
00:27:07,791 --> 00:27:11,208
and prove to everyone that
someone like us can win this.

315
00:27:12,041 --> 00:27:14,875
<i>You represent the hope</i>
<i>of so many people.</i>

316
00:27:16,208 --> 00:27:17,333
<i>And apart from that…</i>

317
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,291
I just wanna see you win.

318
00:27:24,291 --> 00:27:26,333
<i>I'm going to give it my all.</i>

319
00:27:30,958 --> 00:27:35,250
<i>Ladies,</i>
<i>welcome to the final round.</i>

320
00:28:25,125 --> 00:28:27,625
Gentlemen, follow me to the green room.

321
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,458
VAL: ALL DONE.

322
00:28:40,375 --> 00:28:42,291
<i>According to tradition,</i>

323
00:28:42,375 --> 00:28:47,583
<i>a lady who catches the bride's bouquet</i>
<i>becomes the next to marry.</i>

324
00:28:47,666 --> 00:28:51,291
<i>The first stage is Grab The Bouquet.</i>

325
00:28:59,208 --> 00:29:02,916
<i>We invite you all to count down</i>
<i>to begin the game.</i>

326
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:07,833
<i>Ready, Set, Love!</i>

327
00:29:21,833 --> 00:29:23,958
You, out of the way.

328
00:29:33,625 --> 00:29:35,583
Stay back. Chanel, catch it!

329
00:29:35,666 --> 00:29:37,458
Where are you going?

330
00:29:37,541 --> 00:29:39,416
-Hey!
-No!

331
00:29:50,958 --> 00:29:51,791
Ha!

332
00:30:00,458 --> 00:30:05,708
<i>The second stage</i>
<i>is the Silver and Golden Gates.</i>

333
00:30:16,333 --> 00:30:18,375
-Chal, wait up.
-I'll just guess.

334
00:30:27,041 --> 00:30:28,250
Oh!

335
00:30:28,333 --> 00:30:29,875
Oh, no.

336
00:30:29,958 --> 00:30:33,291
Every door has a different challenge
behind it.

337
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:35,625
-Huh?
-Huh?

338
00:30:39,958 --> 00:30:41,208
Uh…

339
00:30:41,291 --> 00:30:42,791
This one?

340
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:45,583
Oh!

341
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:47,833
Okay, okay.

342
00:31:01,916 --> 00:31:02,916
Whoa!

343
00:31:19,291 --> 00:31:20,166
Hm.

344
00:31:27,708 --> 00:31:29,041
Haha!

345
00:31:32,666 --> 00:31:33,708
Oh!

346
00:31:33,791 --> 00:31:37,000
Oh, it seems that
it's not going well for Day.

347
00:31:37,666 --> 00:31:40,291
<i>She's fallen into the ball pit</i>
<i>twice already.</i>

348
00:31:52,041 --> 00:31:53,041
-Bye.
-Bye.

349
00:32:05,458 --> 00:32:09,291
<i>And now Chanel and Bovy</i>
<i>have opened the last door.</i>

350
00:32:09,375 --> 00:32:12,250
<i>They've made it through</i>
<i>the Silver and Golden Gates.</i>

351
00:32:12,875 --> 00:32:18,166
<i>Venus is in hot pursuit,</i>
<i>but Day is still way behind.</i>

352
00:32:19,125 --> 00:32:21,875
Chanel has talent. You must be proud.

353
00:32:24,291 --> 00:32:28,375
You're too kind.
Although I appreciate the compliment.

354
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:42,291
Hey, check out the food.

355
00:32:42,375 --> 00:32:44,250
What, are you kidding?

356
00:32:44,416 --> 00:32:48,000
-Hey, look at these. Bring some plates.
-Yeah, yeah.

357
00:32:48,083 --> 00:32:50,083
Plates, plates, plates, plates, plates.

358
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:52,875
Mm. It all looks so good.

359
00:32:52,958 --> 00:32:55,208
Almond eat up, there's plenty.

360
00:32:55,916 --> 00:32:59,750
You go ahead.
I don't wanna end up fat like you.

361
00:32:59,833 --> 00:33:02,208
Huh? Who's he calling fat?

362
00:33:02,291 --> 00:33:04,916
-You, you, you.
-What did you say? Say that again.

363
00:33:06,125 --> 00:33:09,083
<i>Gentlemen,</i>
<i>I need your help with something.</i>

364
00:33:10,416 --> 00:33:12,583
I need access to their system, right?

365
00:33:13,166 --> 00:33:15,500
So one of you needs to install
the hacking program

366
00:33:15,583 --> 00:33:17,000
on one of their computers.

367
00:33:18,708 --> 00:33:20,208
Uh, where are you going?

368
00:33:23,416 --> 00:33:26,250
To the bathroom. You gonna follow us?

369
00:33:26,333 --> 00:33:28,541
Uh, no. Go ahead.

370
00:33:30,333 --> 00:33:31,416
Don't work too hard.

371
00:33:32,083 --> 00:33:33,291
Take it easy. See you.

372
00:33:55,208 --> 00:33:57,000
Hey! What are you two doing?

373
00:33:57,875 --> 00:33:59,083
I'm going!

374
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:05,541
Where are Chanel and Bovy?

375
00:34:05,625 --> 00:34:07,916
-They always stick together.
-Mm?

376
00:34:08,625 --> 00:34:10,208
Whoa! She's amazing.

377
00:34:11,791 --> 00:34:13,583
<i>Wow, look at Venus.</i>

378
00:34:14,291 --> 00:34:15,791
She's showing off her skill.

379
00:34:15,875 --> 00:34:17,000
Is she a mountain goat?

380
00:34:17,083 --> 00:34:19,375
Ooh, she climbs very well.

381
00:34:20,125 --> 00:34:21,541
But watch out.

382
00:34:21,625 --> 00:34:24,291
<i>This stage</i>
<i>is Acceptance of Dowry.</i>

383
00:34:24,875 --> 00:34:29,333
<i>According to tradition,</i>
<i>the bride receives a dowry from the groom,</i>

384
00:34:29,416 --> 00:34:31,083
<i>commonly money or gold.</i>

385
00:35:00,166 --> 00:35:02,083
-This doesn't look fair.
-Right?

386
00:35:19,666 --> 00:35:21,750
-Paper?
-Yup.

387
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:25,791
What?
What are you doing up here?

388
00:35:26,875 --> 00:35:29,375
I'm really inspired by the effects team.

389
00:35:29,458 --> 00:35:32,625
So I wanted to know how it's done.

390
00:35:33,208 --> 00:35:35,875
I've always admired
visual effects artists.

391
00:35:35,958 --> 00:35:40,375
Really? Well, in that case,
let me show you how it works.

392
00:35:41,083 --> 00:35:42,708
-Let's start by looking at--
-Hey!

393
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:45,583
Oh…

394
00:35:45,666 --> 00:35:46,791
Uh, sorry about that.

395
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:52,041
That console controls sound.

396
00:35:52,125 --> 00:35:56,333
You adjust it up and down here
and it comes out here.

397
00:35:57,625 --> 00:35:59,833
And this one is for lighting.

398
00:36:16,916 --> 00:36:18,625
Chal, look out!

399
00:36:27,875 --> 00:36:29,750
Chal, hurry.

400
00:36:29,833 --> 00:36:32,083
-Go!
-Bovy!

401
00:36:33,958 --> 00:36:35,916
Go now.

402
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:36,958
Bovy.

403
00:36:39,041 --> 00:36:40,125
Why are you still here?

404
00:36:41,625 --> 00:36:42,625
Bovy.

405
00:36:44,041 --> 00:36:45,750
I'm begging. Go now.

406
00:36:45,833 --> 00:36:46,875
This really hurts.

407
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:49,083
Oh.

408
00:37:20,583 --> 00:37:21,666
Where are you going?

409
00:37:24,166 --> 00:37:25,958
I have to take care of something.

410
00:37:31,333 --> 00:37:34,083
-…can rotate it all around.
-What are these lights?

411
00:37:34,166 --> 00:37:37,125
Oh, those, you can adjust
up and down if you want.

412
00:37:37,208 --> 00:37:39,333
We mostly use them for effects.

413
00:37:39,416 --> 00:37:41,333
Those are the lights,
you can select those--

414
00:37:43,666 --> 00:37:45,083
-Hey!
-Um…

415
00:37:45,166 --> 00:37:47,208
Um, I'm not here for the effects team.

416
00:37:47,833 --> 00:37:49,750
-Oh! So…
-I'm here for you.

417
00:37:51,208 --> 00:37:54,166
The real reason that I came up here

418
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,541
was to be close to you.

419
00:37:57,416 --> 00:37:59,541
I've hidden my true feelings too long.

420
00:38:00,875 --> 00:38:04,291
From the moment I first saw you,
I knew you were the one for me.

421
00:38:10,625 --> 00:38:12,000
But I'm one of The Gentlemen.

422
00:38:13,041 --> 00:38:15,541
I'll never be free to love who I choose.

423
00:38:15,625 --> 00:38:17,041
Don't cry, Paper.

424
00:38:18,416 --> 00:38:19,541
I understand.

425
00:38:19,625 --> 00:38:21,750
It all makes sense now.

426
00:38:21,833 --> 00:38:25,166
God, Paper's gone full drama.

427
00:38:29,333 --> 00:38:30,666
Ah! Yes.

428
00:38:42,125 --> 00:38:43,791
Though we can't be together,

429
00:38:44,708 --> 00:38:47,833
I needed you to know how I truly feel.

430
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,875
Oh, my dear Paper.

431
00:38:50,958 --> 00:38:53,083
You've made me so happy.

432
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,625
SON: PROGRAM HAS BEEN INSTALLED.

433
00:39:24,375 --> 00:39:26,500
You're too reckless, Valentine.

434
00:39:31,333 --> 00:39:33,083
<i>The final round?</i>

435
00:39:41,666 --> 00:39:42,583
Yeah.

436
00:39:45,333 --> 00:39:47,875
Your friends just refuse to give up,
don't they?

437
00:39:51,291 --> 00:39:52,916
I know you gave them a warning.

438
00:39:54,208 --> 00:39:55,250
But I'd…

439
00:39:56,166 --> 00:40:00,958
I'd be grateful for you keeping them
out of the hands of the government.

440
00:40:06,833 --> 00:40:09,416
I appreciate you keeping an eye on them.

441
00:40:14,166 --> 00:40:15,791
I'm not here to help you.

442
00:40:17,208 --> 00:40:19,333
I'm helping protect my brothers.

443
00:40:21,416 --> 00:40:22,333
Protect them?

444
00:40:23,458 --> 00:40:25,208
Betrayal's a funny way to do it.

445
00:40:28,916 --> 00:40:29,791
Yeah.

446
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,125
My brothers don't know what they're doing.

447
00:40:34,083 --> 00:40:38,250
If they follow their plan,
outside The Farm, they'll be in hiding.

448
00:40:39,041 --> 00:40:40,708
They'll only get themselves hurt.

449
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:43,625
You understand…

450
00:40:45,125 --> 00:40:46,125
about hiding.

451
00:40:48,291 --> 00:40:49,500
I better get going.

452
00:41:09,916 --> 00:41:14,375
<i>The final stage</i>
<i>is Marriage Registration.</i>

453
00:41:26,458 --> 00:41:29,541
<i>The Ladies must use the brush provided</i>

454
00:41:29,625 --> 00:41:34,125
<i>to sign their name</i>
<i>on the marriage certificate.</i>

455
00:41:35,541 --> 00:41:37,541
<i>Please wait for the signal.</i>

456
00:41:40,916 --> 00:41:42,166
<i>Go.</i>

457
00:41:49,958 --> 00:41:52,541
<i>Before signing the certificate,</i>

458
00:41:52,625 --> 00:41:55,666
<i>you will be cleansed with blessed water.</i>

459
00:42:02,583 --> 00:42:03,875
Aw!

460
00:42:08,666 --> 00:42:11,583
This is ridiculous.
What's with all the formality?

461
00:42:52,875 --> 00:42:54,958
Go, Day!

462
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:08,500
Ha!

463
00:43:08,583 --> 00:43:09,625
Whoa!

464
00:43:10,166 --> 00:43:13,333
Oh!

465
00:43:29,791 --> 00:43:31,041
It's okay. Try again.

466
00:44:26,958 --> 00:44:30,125
<i>You represent the hope</i>
<i>of so many people.</i>

467
00:44:30,208 --> 00:44:32,208
<i>You have to win the last game</i>

468
00:44:32,291 --> 00:44:35,416
<i>and prove to everyone that</i>
<i>someone like us can win this.</i>

469
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,583
<i>The winner is Chanel.</i>

470
00:44:42,791 --> 00:44:44,291
-Oh!
-Wow, congrats.

471
00:44:47,333 --> 00:44:48,416
On behalf of the group,

472
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:51,166
I'd like to congratulate Chanel
on her victory.

473
00:44:51,250 --> 00:44:53,708
Let's have a toast
for Chanel and Ms. Kwan.

474
00:44:54,833 --> 00:44:56,125
Congratulations, Ms. Kwan.

475
00:44:56,791 --> 00:45:00,666
<i>Well, I guess you could say</i>
<i>the tides just kept turning.</i>

476
00:45:00,750 --> 00:45:02,875
<i>That brings us</i>
<i>to the end of the competition.</i>

477
00:45:02,958 --> 00:45:03,875
It'll be okay, Day.

478
00:45:03,958 --> 00:45:05,625
<i>It was a night full of surprises.</i>

479
00:45:06,458 --> 00:45:07,666
You did so well.

480
00:45:11,041 --> 00:45:14,583
And here are the final scores
for The Ladies.

481
00:45:14,666 --> 00:45:16,833
Oh, it was so close.

482
00:45:16,916 --> 00:45:20,166
-The margin is tiny.
-It really was neck and neck.

483
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:25,875
Now is the moment you've been waiting for
all along.

484
00:45:29,416 --> 00:45:33,916
<i>This is the last time</i>
<i>The Ladies will choose a gentleman.</i>

485
00:45:34,666 --> 00:45:38,916
<i>This time they are not choosing a man</i>
<i>for a date</i>

486
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,875
<i>but for marriage.</i>

487
00:45:43,166 --> 00:45:46,458
<i>The first Lady to choose her life partner</i>

488
00:45:47,041 --> 00:45:48,541
<i>is Chanel.</i>

489
00:46:03,958 --> 00:46:04,958
Son.

490
00:46:32,208 --> 00:46:33,166
I'm sorry.

491
00:46:37,041 --> 00:46:38,666
I don't think we can be together.

492
00:46:48,166 --> 00:46:49,041
Huh?

493
00:46:49,875 --> 00:46:51,083
What's with Chanel?

494
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,708
We've known each other
since we were little kids,

495
00:47:00,708 --> 00:47:02,916
and I think I know you quite well.

496
00:47:04,125 --> 00:47:05,708
I know what you feel inside.

497
00:47:29,625 --> 00:47:30,625
Max.

498
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,500
Today you have beaten Son.

499
00:47:46,791 --> 00:47:48,041
Will you marry me?

500
00:47:56,291 --> 00:47:57,166
Marry you?

501
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:06,416
Huh?

502
00:48:07,583 --> 00:48:10,291
There are just so many plot twists
this season.

503
00:48:11,541 --> 00:48:13,583
Mm, I feel sad for Bovy.

504
00:48:13,666 --> 00:48:16,666
She's been crazy about Max all this time.

505
00:48:17,375 --> 00:48:20,291
Yay!

506
00:48:20,375 --> 00:48:21,666
What now?

507
00:48:40,125 --> 00:48:42,458
Hey, Lotto, here's your chance.

508
00:48:44,625 --> 00:48:46,166
Don't go wasting it.

509
00:49:00,458 --> 00:49:04,125
<i>The next Lady</i>
<i>to choose her life partner is</i>…

510
00:49:04,875 --> 00:49:05,875
<i>Day.</i>

511
00:49:37,333 --> 00:49:38,750
Before I choose,

512
00:49:40,250 --> 00:49:42,833
there's something
I need to tell all of you tonight.

513
00:49:47,583 --> 00:49:52,375
I think that you're all aware
my life hasn't always been easy.

514
00:49:54,041 --> 00:49:55,916
And I really thought that

515
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,666
if I had the chance
to be in <i>Ready, Set, Love,</i>

516
00:50:00,166 --> 00:50:02,583
then my life would turn out perfectly.

517
00:50:03,958 --> 00:50:05,083
This show…

518
00:50:06,333 --> 00:50:09,958
let me compete
in a fair manner with others

519
00:50:11,458 --> 00:50:13,625
and offered the chance for a better life.

520
00:50:18,625 --> 00:50:20,833
And to be
with the person that I truly love.

521
00:50:23,791 --> 00:50:24,916
This show…

522
00:50:26,583 --> 00:50:28,916
gave me the opportunity
to live on The Farm,

523
00:50:30,250 --> 00:50:32,416
a beautiful and luxurious place.

524
00:50:36,333 --> 00:50:38,500
I never thought
I would live in such comfort…

525
00:50:39,416 --> 00:50:41,083
or even experience it.

526
00:50:42,833 --> 00:50:47,125
And it really is…
an amazing place to live in.

527
00:50:54,291 --> 00:50:55,208
It is…

528
00:50:56,250 --> 00:50:59,833
a place that you can never go
unless you comply with the system.

529
00:51:24,041 --> 00:51:25,833
Those are people who didn't comply,

530
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:28,708
who were captured
and locked up under The Farm.

531
00:51:29,583 --> 00:51:30,583
Their crime?

532
00:51:31,958 --> 00:51:35,333
Being opposed to the system
that would take their sons away!

533
00:51:43,166 --> 00:51:44,291
Cut the signal!

534
00:51:45,625 --> 00:51:46,666
Cut it.

535
00:51:48,125 --> 00:51:49,000
Leave it on.

536
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,458
MS. KWAN

537
00:51:58,708 --> 00:52:01,041
<i>Did you really think</i>
<i>your plan was going to work?</i>

538
00:52:07,375 --> 00:52:09,250
Men who live outside The Farm exist?

539
00:52:14,875 --> 00:52:15,791
Yeah.

540
00:52:16,791 --> 00:52:18,875
It might not be
as comfortable as The Farm,

541
00:52:19,416 --> 00:52:21,625
but they grew up in a loving family

542
00:52:21,708 --> 00:52:23,041
under their mothers' care.

543
00:52:27,625 --> 00:52:31,708
Your plan has no chance of succeeding…

544
00:52:34,458 --> 00:52:37,458
without assistance from an insider.

545
00:52:42,250 --> 00:52:45,750
<i>The show was created simply</i>
<i>as propaganda for The Farm.</i>

546
00:52:47,583 --> 00:52:49,333
And the Lotto Girl?

547
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:51,333
I'm here to boost the ratings.

548
00:52:51,416 --> 00:52:54,000
I need you all to understand that

549
00:52:54,083 --> 00:52:56,375
I'm not here
because I'm clever or special.

550
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,416
The only reason I'm still here
is because I complied.

551
00:53:08,291 --> 00:53:09,333
As of now…

552
00:53:11,416 --> 00:53:13,291
I am done complying.

553
00:53:17,291 --> 00:53:18,958
Instead, I'm taking a stand.

554
00:53:22,833 --> 00:53:24,833
And I'm choosing the person that I love.

555
00:53:42,125 --> 00:53:47,166
Lotto Girl,
Lotto Girl, Lotto Girl!

556
00:53:47,250 --> 00:53:50,375
Lotto Girl, Lotto Girl, Lotto Girl!

557
00:53:54,333 --> 00:53:57,000
Lotto Girl, Lotto Girl, Lotto Girl!

558
00:53:57,083 --> 00:54:01,166
Lotto Girl, Lotto Girl, Lotto Girl!

559
00:54:12,875 --> 00:54:14,875
You go for it, girl.

560
00:54:36,541 --> 00:54:39,166
It'll be okay. I'm here now.

561
00:55:02,625 --> 00:55:03,583
Day!

562
00:55:09,541 --> 00:55:12,750
Lotto Girl,
Lotto Girl, Lotto Girl!

563
00:55:21,375 --> 00:55:24,875
Down with The Farm!
Down with The Farm!

564
00:55:24,958 --> 00:55:26,541
Down with The Farm!

565
00:55:31,125 --> 00:55:33,458
Down with The Farm!

566
00:55:51,625 --> 00:55:54,708
Down with The Farm!
Down with The Farm!

567
00:56:00,458 --> 00:56:01,500
Come on!

568
00:56:15,708 --> 00:56:16,791
Paper!

569
00:56:20,333 --> 00:56:21,291
Good luck.

570
00:56:23,875 --> 00:56:26,916
Down with The Farm!

571
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,041
Paper! That way.

572
00:56:30,458 --> 00:56:31,500
Go.

573
00:56:40,916 --> 00:56:41,833
This way.

574
00:56:46,875 --> 00:56:47,750
What?

575
00:56:54,125 --> 00:56:54,958
Val!

576
00:57:18,916 --> 00:57:20,083
We need to leave.

577
00:57:20,166 --> 00:57:21,333
-Come on.
-Right, come on.

578
00:57:22,916 --> 00:57:24,000
Go on.

579
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,750
Almond, come on, hurry.

580
00:57:29,666 --> 00:57:30,500
Hm?

581
00:57:32,125 --> 00:57:33,791
Come on. Get in.

582
00:57:34,625 --> 00:57:38,083
Almond, come on.
What are you doing? Hurry!

583
00:57:39,541 --> 00:57:40,500
Come on, Al!

584
00:57:41,625 --> 00:57:42,625
Wait.

585
00:57:45,916 --> 00:57:48,541
I knew it. You're not coming.

586
00:57:55,291 --> 00:57:57,666
-Come on, come with us.
-I can't.

587
00:58:05,166 --> 00:58:06,083
God damn it!

588
00:58:09,125 --> 00:58:10,750
I know what you did to us.

589
00:58:13,583 --> 00:58:15,458
But I'm begging. Let's go.

590
00:58:17,125 --> 00:58:18,333
<i>Beware of Almond.</i>

591
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,958
<i>He's the one who told me about your plans</i>.

592
00:58:32,125 --> 00:58:33,041
How could you?

593
00:58:36,666 --> 00:58:38,500
Why would you do that to us?

594
00:58:39,083 --> 00:58:40,291
We trusted you.

595
00:58:41,083 --> 00:58:43,166
Uh… I'm sorry.

596
00:58:45,166 --> 00:58:46,958
I couldn't let you go through with it.

597
00:58:49,541 --> 00:58:51,041
I wondered at the beginning

598
00:58:51,875 --> 00:58:53,625
why you agreed to be a part of this.

599
00:58:56,166 --> 00:58:59,250
But I didn't think you'd betray us, Al.

600
00:59:03,166 --> 00:59:05,750
Valentine, if you know about this,
why the hell--

601
00:59:05,833 --> 00:59:06,916
He's my brother, all right?

602
00:59:19,750 --> 00:59:20,583
Brother?

603
00:59:24,416 --> 00:59:25,250
Yes.

604
00:59:27,375 --> 00:59:29,375
I know you don't want to leave The Farm.

605
00:59:30,166 --> 00:59:32,583
And I know
you don't agree with City Ground.

606
00:59:34,125 --> 00:59:37,333
But you have a mother
and she searched for you your whole life.

607
00:59:46,250 --> 00:59:49,791
Please, Almond, I'm begging you.
Come with us.

608
00:59:50,750 --> 00:59:54,541
Your mother is… she's waiting for you.

609
00:59:55,416 --> 00:59:56,708
Our mother's waiting.

610
00:59:56,791 --> 00:59:58,666
She's always been waiting.

611
01:00:06,041 --> 01:00:07,041
I can't.

612
01:00:09,708 --> 01:00:10,583
I'm sorry.

613
01:00:12,041 --> 01:00:13,541
The Farm's my home.

614
01:00:20,041 --> 01:00:21,125
You go ahead.

615
01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:24,708
I can't.

616
01:00:39,416 --> 01:00:42,125
Val, we need to go.

617
01:00:43,791 --> 01:00:44,916
He's made his choice.

618
01:01:25,791 --> 01:01:26,875
Son.

619
01:01:29,333 --> 01:01:31,125
It wasn't meant to be like this.

620
01:01:38,791 --> 01:01:39,666
Chun…

621
01:01:41,416 --> 01:01:44,833
everything I've done,
it's not all in vain, is it?

622
01:01:46,250 --> 01:01:47,083
It's okay.

623
01:01:48,458 --> 01:01:51,458
You did your best. It's all you can ask.

624
01:02:14,166 --> 01:02:15,000
Hello.

625
01:02:16,250 --> 01:02:18,916
What? How could that happen?

626
01:02:20,958 --> 01:02:21,958
Ms. Jenny.

627
01:02:22,041 --> 01:02:23,833
That was security.

628
01:02:23,916 --> 01:02:27,458
They say that Day, Son and Paper
have escaped The Farm.

629
01:02:32,583 --> 01:02:33,500
MS. KWAN

630
01:03:14,666 --> 01:03:16,833
Here she is. Come on,
come on, come on, come on.

631
01:03:17,541 --> 01:03:18,750
Oh, thank God.

632
01:03:40,916 --> 01:03:43,375
<i>You were the last person</i>
<i>to see them.</i>

633
01:03:43,958 --> 01:03:46,791
<i>Are you denying you knew about their plan?</i>

634
01:03:48,333 --> 01:03:52,375
You realize that if you are found
guilty of perjuring yourself,

635
01:03:52,458 --> 01:03:54,875
especially in a case this serious,

636
01:03:55,416 --> 01:03:58,333
you will receive the maximum punishment.

637
01:03:59,000 --> 01:03:59,916
I accept that.

638
01:04:37,791 --> 01:04:40,083
I know you must be disappointed.

639
01:04:41,375 --> 01:04:42,791
But from now on,

640
01:04:43,791 --> 01:04:45,166
get used to it.

641
01:04:46,500 --> 01:04:48,291
Regardless of what you want,

642
01:04:48,375 --> 01:04:50,416
I'll marry who I choose.

643
01:05:17,333 --> 01:05:19,458
You know, Chal, I'm proud of you.

644
01:05:21,125 --> 01:05:23,125
And not because you won the game.

645
01:05:24,750 --> 01:05:28,500
I'm proud because you had the courage
to choose what you wanted.

646
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
Don't be too mad at your mother.

647
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,916
She tries her hardest
to do what's best for us.

648
01:05:43,875 --> 01:05:47,208
And I understand
why she is the way she is.

649
01:05:48,333 --> 01:05:52,916
Because she's had to spend her life
with someone that she doesn't love.

650
01:05:58,875 --> 01:06:00,125
But aren't you tired?

651
01:06:02,958 --> 01:06:05,541
Honestly, I think both of us are tired.

652
01:06:20,750 --> 01:06:23,208
BREAKING NEWS - A PROTEST
AT THE FINAL ROUND OF READY, SET, LOVE

653
01:06:24,708 --> 01:06:29,666
<i>Protesting has continued in the wake</i>
<i>of the </i>Ready, Set, Love <i>final game.</i>

654
01:06:29,750 --> 01:06:32,666
<i>Additionally, a government curfew</i>
<i>has been introduced</i>

655
01:06:32,750 --> 01:06:34,166
<i>to keep people safe.</i>

656
01:06:34,250 --> 01:06:35,708
<i>There have been no updates</i>

657
01:06:35,791 --> 01:06:38,875
<i>on the disappearance</i>
<i>of three of the show's stars.</i>

658
01:06:38,958 --> 01:06:42,583
<i>The incident has led Ms. Chanetti,</i>
<i>leader of Supreme,</i>

659
01:06:42,666 --> 01:06:46,000
<i>to launch a political campaign</i>
<i>supporting The Farm system</i>

660
01:06:46,083 --> 01:06:48,166
<i>in the lead up to her re-election.</i>

661
01:06:49,125 --> 01:06:50,166
What do you think…

662
01:06:52,333 --> 01:06:53,916
is going to happen to us?

663
01:06:56,791 --> 01:06:59,083
I've no idea. But you know what?

664
01:07:01,791 --> 01:07:03,916
No matter what does happen…

665
01:07:07,166 --> 01:07:09,416
I know that
I'll never regret our decision.

666
01:07:13,208 --> 01:07:15,000
Because it gave me the chance

667
01:07:16,416 --> 01:07:17,916
to be with you, Day.

668
01:07:22,958 --> 01:07:24,458
And I feel the same.

669
01:07:36,333 --> 01:07:39,833
Aw. Don't be shy. Show me the love--

670
01:07:39,916 --> 01:07:41,875
May! Behave.

671
01:07:46,125 --> 01:07:48,541
-What? Hello!
-Oh, you!

672
01:07:49,500 --> 01:07:51,833
May! Both of you. Really?

673
01:07:52,750 --> 01:07:55,291
-May, you come here, missy.
-I was just leaving. No, please, Day!

674
01:07:55,375 --> 01:07:58,125
-I'm gonna get you.
-No!

675
01:07:58,208 --> 01:08:00,875
-Come here. Come here.
-I was just kidding.

676
01:08:00,958 --> 01:08:03,375
Here, Son. Take this. Help me get her.

677
01:08:04,875 --> 01:08:06,583

Have you thought about what you wanna do?

693
01:09:38,125 --> 01:09:39,291
I've given it some thought.

694
01:09:41,541 --> 01:09:42,541
And?

695
01:09:56,041 --> 01:09:57,125
What do you want?

696
01:10:23,541 --> 01:10:25,125
Is it how you imagined?

697
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:29,416
It's better.

698
01:10:45,541 --> 01:10:47,000
-Babe.
-Hm?

699
01:10:47,666 --> 01:10:49,666
Why didn't you tell The Farm
about our son?

700
01:10:50,791 --> 01:10:54,208
Well, I knew that you would
change your mind in the end.

701
01:10:56,291 --> 01:10:58,458
I know you think you're a bad person,

702
01:10:58,541 --> 01:11:01,708
and it's probably
because you worked with bad people.

703
01:11:01,791 --> 01:11:03,708
I think you thought
you'd become one of them,

704
01:11:04,583 --> 01:11:07,250
except I know you better than that.

705
01:11:08,541 --> 01:11:13,916
I know that my babe is a better person
than she thinks she is.

706
01:11:16,875 --> 01:11:18,125
Smart puppy.

707
01:11:20,916 --> 01:11:22,750
-Am I cute?
-Yes!

708
01:11:22,833 --> 01:11:24,750
You're the greatest, babe.

709
01:11:44,833 --> 01:11:47,333
Oh, you brought me a present.

710
01:11:48,125 --> 01:11:50,291
He wanted to bring Mommy flowers.

711
01:11:52,625 --> 01:11:54,208
Oh!

712
01:11:56,833 --> 01:11:58,958
How nice! Thank you.

713
01:11:59,041 --> 01:12:00,541
-You're pretty.
