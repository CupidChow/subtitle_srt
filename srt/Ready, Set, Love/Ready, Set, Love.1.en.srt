Oh, Son.

71
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:51,791
Not again.

72
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:53,916
How are you so hot?

73
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:58,833

00:06:58,333 --> 00:07:01,875
Damn, May.
The entire street must have heard that.

87
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:03,541
Sorry about the mess, Son.

88
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:05,583
Ah! So pretty.

-He's pale like tofu.
-Pale hot tofu.

90
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:10,250
He is not hot tofu!

91
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:12,708
He's a tofu cupcake, and he's luscious.

92
00:07:12,791 --> 00:07:13,958
Ugh.

93
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,208
Still planning on winning?

94
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:31,583
Even if there's a .00001% chance,
I'm going to fight because I'm a fighter.

95
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:34,166
Okay.

96
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:37,750
I hate this show, yeah?

97
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:41,875
How come love has to be
between a man and a woman to be love?

98
00:07:41,958 --> 00:07:44,958
Oh, you're a love guru.
So where's your boyfriend?

99
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:53,708
You've already opened the fridge,
so how about you open your heart?

100
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:58,125
If I'm no longer here,
then you won't be lonely.

101
00:07:58,208 --> 00:08:01,250
May, don't talk like that.

102
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:06,250
-Have you taken your meds?
-These huge pills…

103
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:08,583
Even big handfuls aren't gonna help a lot.

104
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:12,333
May… Now you stop that.

105
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:14,750
Didn't we talk about this?

106
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:18,916
I was trying to be dramatic. How was it?

107
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:21,375
Oh yeah, yeah. Wonderful.

108
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:23,958
I have to go to work.

109
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:25,208
Mm-hmm.

110
00:08:25,291 --> 00:08:26,750
What do we have to eat?

111
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:55,875
-I could stand over here.
-You should stand in front.

112
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:57,125
That one. Mm-hmm.

113
00:08:57,208 --> 00:08:58,250
Yeah.

114
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,083
Hey, Son, hurry up!

115
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:05,375
Come on, already!

116
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:08,458
Come on, come on!

117
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:12,208
-Hey, what the hell?
-Okay, we're all here.

118
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:13,208
What?

119
00:09:13,916 --> 00:09:16,583
Okay, Gentlemen, one more set.

120
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:19,458
Please make sure you give us a big smile.

121
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:21,458
Son, you stand in the middle.

122
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:26,416
Ms. Jenny, the reporters are ready.

123
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:31,625
What is the direction
of <i>Ready, Set, Love </i>this season?

124
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:35,083
Since I was put in charge
of the new season,

125
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:38,250
my goal has been
to create a more modern show,

126
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:40,750
whilst keeping the charm of past seasons.

127
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:45,875
Is it true
the lotto system was your idea?

128
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:47,083
That's right.

129
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:53,041
In this season, we have diverse criteria
for selecting The Ladies.

130
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:56,250
So no matter who you are,
you can win <i>Ready, Set, Love.</i>

131
00:09:57,041 --> 00:09:59,416
Everyone will have an equal chance.

132
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:20,541
Where are you going, girl?

133
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:22,625
Join me for a meal?

134
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:24,583
My treat.

135
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:26,958
Ooh!

136
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:32,333
Why are you suddenly rich, Ms. Valentine?

137
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:35,375
I got a new job, Day. Let's go out.

138
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:39,791
Actually, I'm not really hungry.

139
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:44,541
Although, you know,
I could probably eat a little.

140
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:45,583
So just wait here.

141
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:48,041
We've been friends forever,
and you've never bought me a meal.

142
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:48,958
Oh.

143
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:56,708
Come on, money bags. Let's go!

144
00:10:56,791 --> 00:10:57,916
Take your pick.

145
00:10:58,583 --> 00:10:59,500
Wow.

146
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,208
Wow!

147
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:04,916
Wow!

148
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,916
Wow. Everything looks so good.

149
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,375
-Okay, go for it.
-Maybe just a couple more.

150
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:11,541
Mmm.

151
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:12,958
Take away, or eat here?

152
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:14,708
Eating here.

153
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:17,916
-Are you gonna have any of this?
-Mm. A little.

154
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,125
A little? Mm.

155
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:22,125
You're getting more?

156
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:24,416
Just a little.

157
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:28,208
-Okay.
-Thanks a lot. Will it take long?

158
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:31,250
It'll be ready in no time, don't worry.

159
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:33,291
-Can you make it spicy?
-Sure.

160
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:44,958
It smells out of this world!

161
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:46,916
You're hungry.

162
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:47,875
Yeah!

163
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:50,791
Mmm.

164
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:56,291
It's so crowded. Like Lottery Day.

165
00:11:56,375 --> 00:12:00,458
Yeah, 'cause tonight's
the final Ladies' Lotto announcement.

166
00:12:01,041 --> 00:12:03,125
There's still time
for you to buy the milk.

167
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:05,333
And now they have
promotions and discounts.

168
00:12:05,416 --> 00:12:08,583
Whoa, sell it like you work there.

169
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,916
Hey…

170
00:12:17,416 --> 00:12:18,791
The name looks right.

171
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:21,000
The face is right.

172
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,750
Yeah, check it out.

173
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:23,833
Huh?

174
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:26,666
Hang on. Are you kidding?

175
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,791
You want to work at <i>Ready, Set, Love?</i>

176
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:29,750
Mm.

177
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:34,333
Hm. I remember you saying
<i>Ready, Set, Love </i>is dumb.

178
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:36,208
I'm so sorry, Val.

179
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:39,375
Something truly terrible
must have happened to your brain.

180
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:41,833
Come on. I was talking big, okay?

181
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:44,208
When the truth is,
we all want to be there.

182
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:47,208
Everyone wants to go to The Farm
for the men.

183
00:12:47,875 --> 00:12:48,750
Really?

184
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,916
-Hm. You're not interested?
-Ew.

185
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,750
In men? No. Knock yourself out.

186
00:12:57,416 --> 00:12:58,958
Hm. Here we go. It's on now.

187
00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:01,041
<i>It's the moment</i>
<i>we've been waiting for.</i>

188
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:05,250
<i>It's time to announce</i>
<i>the final winner of our Ladies' Lotto.</i>

189
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:08,166
<i>Four Ladies' Lotto winners</i>
<i>have already been drawn,</i>

190
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:10,416
<i>but there's still time to enter</i>

191
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,916
<i>for the opportunity</i>
<i>to join our Ladies' Lotto</i>

192
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,041
<i>and to find love…</i>

193
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:17,333
They're always saying that, like,
"Anyone can be in <i>Ready, Set, Love."</i>

194
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:20,416
-And we sit around hoping.
-<i>…dream come true.</i>

195
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:26,041
But what chance have we got?
I mean, what are the odds?

196
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:39,000
<i>Think about that for a moment.</i>

197
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:41,541
How many women enter?

198
00:13:41,625 --> 00:13:43,833
Millions and millions of women.

199
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:53,500
Probability .00001%.

200
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:02,458
And another thing…

201
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:05,583
<i>Whoever wins it,</i>

202
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:10,291
it means that that person has used
their entire lifetime's worth of luck

203
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:11,625
in one go.

204
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:13,000
I would start crying.

205
00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:21,208
<i>The Ladies' Lotto</i>
<i>random selection has begun.</i>

206
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:25,916
<i>We've received millions of entries</i>
<i>with a record number on our final day.</i>

207
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,208
<i>Don't forget that anyone could be</i>
<i>our final Ladies' Lotto contestant</i>,

208
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:33,708
<i>with the chance to find love</i>
<i>with one of The Gentlemen</i>

209
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:37,166
<i>in season seven of </i>Ready, Set, Love.

210
00:14:38,541 --> 00:14:39,708
DARIKA CHOKWITHEE

211
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:43,208
<i>And here she is,</i>
<i>the final winner of our Ladies' Lotto.</i>

212
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:45,083
-Name's right.
-<i>The Lady who'll be</i>

213
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:48,416
<i>joining our contestants</i>
<i>on season seven of </i>Ready, Set, Love.

214
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,375
The face is right.

215
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:54,791
<i>Congratulations</i>
<i>to our winner, Darika Chokwithee!</i>

216
00:15:02,791 --> 00:15:08,125
All my luck!

217
00:15:14,416 --> 00:15:18,250
No! I'm not going!
There's no way in hell!

218
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:19,833
Please, Day.

219
00:15:19,916 --> 00:15:23,041
Do you know how many places I prayed at
to make sure that you'd win?

220
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:27,500
Oh, what am I gonna do?

221
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:28,416
Hey!

222
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,916
How did they get there?

223
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:32,666
I'm not me. Go away!

224
00:15:34,791 --> 00:15:38,666
May, I'll do whatever you want.
It's just not gonna be this.

225
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:40,500
You understand.

226
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:42,166
Yeah. You shouldn't do it.

227
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:43,083
Then you agree.

228
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:45,333
You shouldn't upset your sister.

229
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:50,125
Mm. Damn it, Val! Why would you say that?

230
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:52,333
You should check out
your competition first.

231
00:15:52,416 --> 00:15:55,083
With your face, you won't get far.

232
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:57,666
You'll be knocked out, in the first round.

233
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:02,041
Day, please go.

234
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:04,291
Think of it like
you're just getting me his autograph.

235
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:06,708
Please, please, please. Go on, Day.

236
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:07,958
May, no!

237
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:11,041
Oh, please, please, please. Please!

238
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:11,958
No!

239
00:16:12,041 --> 00:16:15,625
-Day, please go. Please, please, please.
-I'm not going!

240
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,958
Now, listen, this is my final say.

241
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:22,250
No!

242
00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:30,250
Over here, please.

243
00:16:36,791 --> 00:16:39,833
Cheers!

244
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:44,791
Whoo!

245
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:07,916
Look out, because I'm going to snap up

246
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:12,291
my dream man.

247
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:13,833
We have to shine.

248
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:17,750
Once we take the spotlight,
The Gentlemen will be ours.

249
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:22,958
And if we get through the audition,
we get to live at The Farm.

250
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:26,833
What'll I do when I meet Max?
Probably be like…

251
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:28,583
Oh, I see you like him a lot.

252
00:17:28,666 --> 00:17:31,416
But my favorite,
and the best-looking one, is Almond.

253
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,500
-And, boy, can he cook!
-Yeah. Try this.

254
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:34,833
Oh, what is this?

255
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:36,583
-The best part.
-It's just a tail.

256
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:54,625
She's so pretty!

257
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:57,666
Oh look! The Organic Gang has arrived.

258
00:17:58,625 --> 00:17:59,791
The Organic Gang?

259
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:01,083
Mm-hmm.

260
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:04,500
The Organic Gang are kids
born into a family with an actual dad,

261
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,000
and brought up with The Family,

262
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:07,916
which is the village that has men as well.

263
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,541
-Mm-hmm.
-Just like Max, yeah?

264
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:11,958
He's completely organic.

265
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:14,500
Oh really?

266
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:16,458
Yeah.

267
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:18,541
Oh.

268
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:20,250
Wow! It's all gone.

269
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:21,500
Huh. I'll get more.

270
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,750
What the hell?

271
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:29,541
There she is! So pretty!

272
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:33,416
That's Chanel,
the daughter of Eve Capital's president.

273
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,083
She has like a million followers,

274
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:37,583
and she's the queen bee
of, like, everything.

275
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:42,416
And she's a famous starlet.
They call her Bovy the Bonkers.

276
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:45,250
She's also the heiress
to the five-star hotel.

277
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:50,166
Everyone else who gets selected
is either from a famous family,

278
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:53,791
or they're, like, super talented
or really smart or something.

279
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:58,000
Get a phone. I want a pic with Chanel.

280
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:03,708
Whoo!

281
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:17,083
Hello, and welcome, Ladies!

282
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:21,083
You all know The Gentlemen
from their videos,

283
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:23,958
but don't you think it's time
to meet in person?

284
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:35,125
Without further delay,
let's welcome The Gentlemen!

285
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:48,375
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God!

286
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:56,250
Max, Max, Max!

287
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:58,750
Max, would you like to say something?

288
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:02,916
Whassup?

289
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:08,041
Welcome to The Farm Studio.

290
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:13,416
Is anyone else… feeling hot?

291
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:16,083
Not yet!

292
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:26,541
Settle down, Max.

293
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:28,500
Calm down, calm down.

294
00:20:30,291 --> 00:20:32,625
Chal, Chal, Chal…

295
00:20:34,291 --> 00:20:36,625
Son's looking at you!

296
00:20:37,541 --> 00:20:39,791
Listen up, everybody.

297
00:20:40,416 --> 00:20:43,333
Son belongs to Chanel,
and don't touch Max.

298
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:46,083
He belongs to me!

299
00:20:46,166 --> 00:20:47,833
Body, your body!

300
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:49,791
Take it off!

301
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:50,916
Take it off!

302
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,166
Almond next.
Do you have any words for our Ladies?

303
00:20:56,333 --> 00:21:01,541
Yeah, I hope the games we've prepared
won't be too hard.

304
00:21:01,625 --> 00:21:03,458
I want everyone to make it through.

305
00:21:03,541 --> 00:21:06,500
Oh, so nice.

306
00:21:06,583 --> 00:21:07,833
All right, then.

307
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:09,958
Let's start.

308
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:14,250
<i>Ready, Set, Love.</i>

309
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:16,458
Let the audition begin!

310
00:21:18,291 --> 00:21:22,791
Mm. The production budget is huge.

311
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:34,583
You represent our community.
Failure is not an option.

312
00:21:34,666 --> 00:21:36,166
Go, Day!

313
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:37,875
Hey, Day. You got this.

314
00:21:49,416 --> 00:21:52,708
I'm not ready, not yet.

315
00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:03,750
<i>Hello, there.</i>
<i>It's time for us to meet the commentators.</i>

316
00:22:03,833 --> 00:22:10,291
<i>I'm Tew. And let me present</i>
Ready, Set, Love <i>winners Pob and Sarah!</i>

317
00:22:10,375 --> 00:22:11,916
<i>Hi.</i>

318
00:22:13,708 --> 00:22:17,166
<i>Here's The Ladies' Lotto Five,</i>
<i>the winners of our contest.</i>

319
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:20,791
<i>One group to watch out for this season</i>
<i>is The Organic Gang.</i>

320
00:22:20,875 --> 00:22:23,166
<i>In particular, Chanel,</i>

321
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:25,750
<i>a child of The Family,</i>
<i>whom I know personally.</i>

322
00:22:25,833 --> 00:22:27,833
I feel like this game's gonna be so chill.

323
00:22:27,916 --> 00:22:29,250
What's your name?

324
00:22:29,333 --> 00:22:30,708
Uh, Day.

325
00:22:30,791 --> 00:22:31,958
Oh, Day.

326
00:22:32,041 --> 00:22:35,208
-I'm so full. How are you still eating?
-It's very good, right?

327
00:22:35,291 --> 00:22:36,750
-Hey, guys.
-Huh?

328
00:22:36,833 --> 00:22:37,708
Look over there.

329
00:22:37,791 --> 00:22:39,583
-You're welcome.
-They know their stuff.

330
00:22:39,666 --> 00:22:42,583
We Lotto Girls
should have each other's backs.

331
00:22:42,666 --> 00:22:45,041
-Yeah, we'll make it through together.
-Right.

332
00:22:45,125 --> 00:22:47,333
-Ha!
-Ha!

333
00:22:52,791 --> 00:22:54,083
-Huh?
-Hey, Paper.

334
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:56,791
See anyone you like?

335
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:02,541
How can you tell

336
00:23:03,583 --> 00:23:04,791
if you like someone?

337
00:23:04,875 --> 00:23:05,916
Oh!

338
00:23:06,416 --> 00:23:07,750
Sweet Paper.

339
00:23:09,125 --> 00:23:14,958
Oh, whenever she's close,
your chest, it's like, "Mm, mm, mm."

340
00:23:15,958 --> 00:23:18,958
When you gaze into her eyes,
you can't look away.

341
00:23:19,041 --> 00:23:24,416
And if you take her hand in yours,
you'll never want to let go of it again.

342
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:25,708
Mm.

343
00:23:26,375 --> 00:23:29,416
That's right, Paper.

344
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:37,875
Quit it.

345
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:41,750
<i>The game will begin</i>
<i>in 15 minutes.</i>

346
00:23:41,833 --> 00:23:45,208
<i>Ladies, please proceed to the first arena.</i>

347
00:23:46,208 --> 00:23:50,000
Excuse me? Uh, robot lady?

348
00:23:50,083 --> 00:23:51,916
Where's the bathroom?

349
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,541
Oh, thanks.

350
00:24:07,791 --> 00:24:09,791
Ooh!

351
00:24:36,333 --> 00:24:38,333
Mm.

352
00:24:45,166 --> 00:24:46,166
What is it?

353
00:24:46,833 --> 00:24:49,375
Hm?

354
00:24:56,708 --> 00:24:59,041
AUNT NOON: OUR LOTTO LADY

355
00:24:59,125 --> 00:25:01,125
MINNIE MINIMART GIRL:
YOU GOT THE CROWN.

356
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:04,166
VALENTINE: GIVE IT YOUR ALL.
BE A LEGEND.

357
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:10,208
MAY: DON'T FORGET SON'S AUTOGRAPH.
MY SISTER IS THE BEST.

358
00:25:27,125 --> 00:25:29,416
WON'T BE EASY TO MEET HIM.

359
00:25:41,791 --> 00:25:42,916
Mm.

360
00:25:46,958 --> 00:25:47,791
Hm?

361
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:11,208
Oh…

362
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,458
Oh, right.

363
00:26:21,791 --> 00:26:22,750
Hello, there.

364
00:26:22,833 --> 00:26:25,500
Can I please have your autograph?

365
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,791
Hm. My autograph?

366
00:26:32,875 --> 00:26:33,708
Mm.

367
00:26:34,916 --> 00:26:36,416
Then follow protocol.

368
00:26:37,375 --> 00:26:39,791
And don't behave like a stalker, maybe.

369
00:26:40,375 --> 00:26:41,458
Oh!

370
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:46,375
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Just hold on a moment.

371
00:26:46,458 --> 00:26:47,750
You're misunderstanding.

372
00:26:49,416 --> 00:26:50,708
MAY
INCOMING CALL

373
00:26:50,791 --> 00:26:51,791
Hmm.

374
00:26:54,041 --> 00:26:55,083
Perfect timing.

375
00:26:57,208 --> 00:26:58,791
Hello, May.

376
00:26:58,875 --> 00:27:02,041
You just caused me a big misunderstanding!

377
00:27:02,125 --> 00:27:03,958
<i>No, Day. It's me, Noon.</i>

378
00:27:04,041 --> 00:27:04,875
Oh.

379
00:27:05,666 --> 00:27:06,666
What is it then?

380
00:27:07,958 --> 00:27:09,625
Is something the matter?

381
00:27:09,708 --> 00:27:10,541
Where's May?

382
00:27:10,625 --> 00:27:13,041
<i>She's in the emergency room.</i>

383
00:27:13,125 --> 00:27:17,583
<i>Well, she collapsed,</i>
<i>so we all hurried her to the hospital.</i>

384
00:27:28,125 --> 00:27:29,791
She's waiting for you, Ms. Jenny.

385
00:27:44,333 --> 00:27:45,166
Day, isn't it?

386
00:27:47,875 --> 00:27:49,666
I'm Jenny. I produce the show.

387
00:27:55,833 --> 00:27:57,083
I would like to withdraw.

388
00:27:57,166 --> 00:27:59,250
My sister was admitted to hospital.

389
00:27:59,333 --> 00:28:02,458
She's in the middle of chemo,
and her health isn't great.

390
00:28:03,125 --> 00:28:05,375
I'm afraid I can't stay
in the competition.

391
00:28:06,875 --> 00:28:09,125
I'm sorry
if this causes any inconvenience.

392
00:28:18,833 --> 00:28:21,416
Do you know what the prize
for <i>Ready, Set, Love </i>is?

393
00:28:27,375 --> 00:28:29,083
It's marriage to a Gentleman.

394
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:32,208
And being welcomed into The Family.

395
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:38,000
And what comes with that
is your family receives the best care,

396
00:28:38,083 --> 00:28:40,541
such as top-notch medical procedures.

397
00:28:42,875 --> 00:28:47,416
I think it's important to think about
exactly what you want for your future.

398
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:50,333
What do you think?

399
00:28:51,125 --> 00:28:53,708
What kind of future
will you give your sister?

400
00:29:29,083 --> 00:29:30,750
I want a lot of footage of her.

401
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:32,416
Yes, boss.

402
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:35,666
Now we have a family drama
for the audience to root for,

403
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:37,208
and that's ratings gold.

404
00:29:37,291 --> 00:29:38,416
I'll get right on it.

405
00:29:49,791 --> 00:29:50,666
How is May?

406
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:54,875
She's still waiting in emergency.

407
00:29:55,458 --> 00:29:57,125
The doctor hasn't arrived.

408
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,083
Perhaps that producer is right.

409
00:30:07,166 --> 00:30:09,625
I can't rely on public health care.

410
00:30:10,583 --> 00:30:12,166
We could be waiting months.

411
00:30:13,791 --> 00:30:15,000
As well as that,

412
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:18,500
it probably won't cover
expensive medication.

413
00:30:20,208 --> 00:30:22,750
I can't afford
expensive medical procedures.

414
00:30:24,333 --> 00:30:26,000
May deserves so much better.

415
00:30:38,458 --> 00:30:39,833
Listen up, now.

416
00:30:39,916 --> 00:30:42,125
I'm going to win this competition.

417
00:30:46,666 --> 00:30:48,666
Take a look!

418
00:30:52,125 --> 00:30:56,333
There's an old saying that goes,
"To know someone is to love someone."

419
00:31:00,166 --> 00:31:01,958
This game is Know Your Date,

420
00:31:02,041 --> 00:31:06,083
in which we find out who really
knows the most about The Gentlemen.

421
00:31:35,875 --> 00:31:38,333
<i>Ladies,</i>
<i>please take your positions</i>

422
00:31:38,416 --> 00:31:40,916
<i>and prepare to answer the first question.</i>

423
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:00,708
<i>Contestants must give</i>
<i>their answers</i>

424
00:32:00,791 --> 00:32:02,625
by standing under the colored lights

425
00:32:02,708 --> 00:32:06,000
that represent each of The Gentlemen
within the time limit.

426
00:32:06,583 --> 00:32:08,208
<i>There are five colors.</i>

427
00:32:08,291 --> 00:32:09,625
<i>Max is purple,</i>

428
00:32:09,708 --> 00:32:11,041
<i>Jin is green,</i>

429
00:32:11,125 --> 00:32:12,625
<i>Paper is yellow,</i>

430
00:32:12,708 --> 00:32:14,083
<i>Almond is blue,</i>

431
00:32:14,166 --> 00:32:15,625
<i>and Son is red.</i>

432
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:20,458
Those who answer correctly
will make it through to the next round.

433
00:32:26,333 --> 00:32:28,166
<i>Question one.</i>

434
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:30,916
<i>Who likes to open Netflix each night,</i>

435
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,625
<i>scroll through previews,</i>

436
00:32:32,708 --> 00:32:36,750
<i>and then fall asleep</i>
<i>before picking anything to watch?</i>

437
00:32:47,041 --> 00:32:49,541
How am I meant to know that?

438
00:32:49,625 --> 00:32:53,916
I mean, it's easy.

439
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,625
Everyone should know this.

440
00:33:04,416 --> 00:33:05,291
Come on.

441
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,458
All right, Som, come on.

442
00:33:28,541 --> 00:33:30,208
<i>Time's up.</i>

443
00:33:34,416 --> 00:33:37,208
<i>The answer is Max.</i>

444
00:33:37,791 --> 00:33:40,375
<i>All of The Ladies answered correctly.</i>

445
00:33:40,458 --> 00:33:41,333
Piece of cake.

446
00:33:41,416 --> 00:33:44,541
Duh. With questions like that,
we've got nothing to worry about.

447
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:48,041
Bring it on.

448
00:33:48,125 --> 00:33:50,000
That was easy.

449
00:33:50,083 --> 00:33:50,916
I know, right?

450
00:33:51,583 --> 00:33:54,375
<i>Ladies,</i>
<i>please take your positions</i>

451
00:33:54,458 --> 00:33:57,500
<i>and prepare to answer the second question.</i>

452
00:34:00,625 --> 00:34:01,791
<i>Question two.</i>

453
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:07,541
<i>As a child,</i>
<i>who thought that when the sun set,</i>

454
00:34:07,625 --> 00:34:09,833
<i>it turned into the moon?</i>

455
00:34:09,916 --> 00:34:11,875
Oh! Well, that's…

456
00:34:14,666 --> 00:34:15,875
I have no idea.

457
00:34:16,375 --> 00:34:19,541
Because if it's not about Max,
I don't care at all.

458
00:34:22,833 --> 00:34:24,708
Sun turns into the moon?

459
00:34:31,458 --> 00:34:33,666
Hey, our chances are dropping.

460
00:34:34,541 --> 00:34:35,958
They turned out some lights.

461
00:34:41,833 --> 00:34:42,958
It's Paper, I think.

462
00:34:43,041 --> 00:34:45,083
It's gotta be him.

463
00:34:46,916 --> 00:34:47,916
Jin, of course.

464
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,041
Everybody, it's Jin. Come on.

465
00:34:50,541 --> 00:34:51,916
Okay, it's Jin.

466
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:53,833
I'll just guess.

467
00:34:54,875 --> 00:34:55,750
Hey, wait.

468
00:34:59,125 --> 00:35:00,125
Follow me.

469
00:35:10,666 --> 00:35:12,958
<i>When the sun sets,</i>
<i>it goes underwater.</i>

470
00:35:13,041 --> 00:35:15,625
<i>So when it drops, the fire goes out,</i>

471
00:35:15,708 --> 00:35:17,000
<i>and it's nighttime.</i>

472
00:35:17,083 --> 00:35:19,416
<i>Oh, okay. You're so cute.</i>

473
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,083
Look at this.

474
00:35:21,166 --> 00:35:22,416
Oh, it's so cute.

475
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,333
<i>That's what I thought</i>
<i>when I was a kid…</i>

476
00:35:24,416 --> 00:35:27,708
He thought
when the sun set, it turned into the moon

477
00:35:27,791 --> 00:35:29,083
and floated back up again.

478
00:35:29,166 --> 00:35:31,041
Did he sleep a lot in class?

479
00:35:31,125 --> 00:35:33,750
Hey! Be nice about my Gentlemen, okay?

480
00:35:35,125 --> 00:35:37,041
You'll see, I'll convert you.

481
00:35:37,125 --> 00:35:40,833
Little by little by little.

482
00:35:40,916 --> 00:35:43,500
And before you know it,
you'll love them too.

483
00:35:44,666 --> 00:35:46,291
<i>How many fans thought the same?</i>

484
00:35:50,375 --> 00:35:52,125
Come on, Day!

485
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:53,833
Oh my God!

486
00:35:54,625 --> 00:35:56,583
Come on, get in!

487
00:35:57,166 --> 00:35:59,041
Day, get over here!

488
00:35:59,125 --> 00:36:00,041
Hurry!

489
00:36:11,916 --> 00:36:13,166
<i>Time's up.</i>

490
00:36:18,208 --> 00:36:20,916
<i>The answer is Paper.</i>

491
00:36:22,541 --> 00:36:25,916
<i>Thirty-six of The Ladies</i>
<i>answered correctly.</i>

492
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:26,916
Oh!

493
00:36:27,958 --> 00:36:29,291
We've just kicked off,

494
00:36:29,375 --> 00:36:33,000
but our Ladies' Lotto contestants
are already down to one.

495
00:36:33,666 --> 00:36:36,000
<i>Only Day remains in the competition.</i>

496
00:36:36,083 --> 00:36:39,291
<i>Day, we're really hoping you'll stay.</i>

497
00:36:40,208 --> 00:36:43,208
Wait. Why would they assume
I thought that?

498
00:36:45,708 --> 00:36:48,000
Because you've always been the weird one.

499
00:36:49,875 --> 00:36:50,916
You're a jerk.

500
00:36:51,916 --> 00:36:54,166
-You're the one that thought that!
-Hey, get off me!

501
00:37:03,833 --> 00:37:05,125
Whoa!

502
00:37:10,916 --> 00:37:11,833
That's a shame.

503
00:37:12,416 --> 00:37:14,916
There's only one
Ladies' Lotto contestant left.

504
00:37:16,916 --> 00:37:18,583
Yeah, but she's a stalker, isn't she?

505
00:37:18,666 --> 00:37:19,625
Huh?

506
00:37:20,541 --> 00:37:21,916
Who are you talking about?

507
00:37:28,583 --> 00:37:30,125
Let's go to the next question.

508
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:32,000
Okay.

509
00:37:32,541 --> 00:37:35,750
<i>Ladies,</i>
<i>please take your positions</i>

510
00:37:35,833 --> 00:37:39,166
<i>and prepare to answer the third question.</i>

511
00:38:00,375 --> 00:38:01,750
<i>Question three.</i>

512
00:38:03,291 --> 00:38:07,833
<i>The book </i>Utopia
<i>is a favorite among The Gentlemen.</i>

513
00:38:07,916 --> 00:38:10,750
<i>Who owns their only copy?</i>

514
00:38:27,666 --> 00:38:28,791
Chal, do you know?

515
00:38:30,166 --> 00:38:32,041
Well, it's Son, isn't it?

516
00:38:33,458 --> 00:38:34,916
Oh, Son.

517
00:39:07,333 --> 00:39:08,750
<i>Hey, everyone.</i>

518
00:39:09,625 --> 00:39:12,375
Hey, Day. Come watch Paper's livestream.

519
00:39:12,875 --> 00:39:15,125
May, will you give me just a moment?

520
00:39:15,208 --> 00:39:17,541
<i>…and I want</i>
<i>to recommend it to everyone</i>

521
00:39:17,625 --> 00:39:19,625
<i>because it really is that good.</i>

522
00:39:19,708 --> 00:39:23,333
<i>Here it is. </i>Utopia, <i>by Thomas More.</i>
<i>I think it's my favorite…</i>

523
00:39:23,416 --> 00:39:27,291
Day, can I get this book called <i>Utopia?</i>

524
00:39:27,375 --> 00:39:28,416
But later.

525
00:39:29,125 --> 00:39:32,333
May, not this month because money's tight.

526
00:39:32,416 --> 00:39:33,916
It's just one book, Day.

527
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,375
-<i>When I first bought it--</i>
-<i>Oh, you bought it?</i>

528
00:39:36,458 --> 00:39:37,791
<i>Hey, that's my book.</i>

529
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:39,958
<i>You got the pages all dogeared.</i>

530
00:39:40,041 --> 00:39:42,500
<i>Don't take it, please!</i>
<i>Give it back!</i>

531
00:39:42,583 --> 00:39:44,583
<i>Come on, Almond!</i>

532
00:39:47,333 --> 00:39:48,458
Losers.

533
00:39:48,541 --> 00:39:49,375

-Huh?

540
00:40:06,458 --> 00:40:08,625
Oh hey, don't push.

541
00:40:10,458 --> 00:40:11,625
<i>Is that a tactic?</i>

542
00:40:11,708 --> 00:40:12,916
They're doing this.

543
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,416
-Oh God! Ugh!
-I think it's karate.

544
00:40:16,166 --> 00:40:18,250
Ooh, who let the cat out?

545
00:40:20,083 --> 00:40:21,541
Hey, stop pushing!

546
00:40:22,375 --> 00:40:25,125
Hey! What are you doing?
Don't touch her!

547
00:40:26,208 --> 00:40:28,166
Chal, let go of her!

548
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:29,666
<i>Time's up.</i>

549
00:40:31,666 --> 00:40:34,416
<i>The answer is Almond.</i>

550
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:58,000
<i>Twenty-five</i>
<i>of The Ladies answered correctly.</i>

551
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:03,208
<i>Ladies,</i>
<i>please take your positions</i>

552
00:41:03,291 --> 00:41:06,291
<i>and prepare to answer the final question.</i>

553
00:41:06,375 --> 00:41:07,250
Sorry.

554
00:41:08,041 --> 00:41:09,583
Would you mind releasing it?

555
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:21,500
Would you mind releasing it?

556
00:41:25,875 --> 00:41:27,500
<i>Final question.</i>

557
00:41:29,166 --> 00:41:32,833
<i>Which gentleman is so afraid of fireworks,</i>

558
00:41:32,916 --> 00:41:36,291
<i>he cannot be alone on New Year's Eve?</i>

559
00:41:54,208 --> 00:41:55,041
Right.

560
00:42:00,333 --> 00:42:02,208
Look, isn't it pretty?

561
00:42:02,291 --> 00:42:04,875
-Do you like it?
-Yep.

562
00:42:07,833 --> 00:42:08,666
You know what?

563
00:42:09,333 --> 00:42:13,250
I bet you can't guess
which Gentleman is afraid of fireworks?

564
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:17,708
May, you're always
talking about these guys.

565
00:42:17,791 --> 00:42:19,458
Aren't you sick of them all?

566
00:42:26,166 --> 00:42:28,250
And The Gentlemen's items
you bought today.

567
00:42:29,166 --> 00:42:33,041
Do you understand how many shifts
I had to work to afford them?

568
00:42:34,333 --> 00:42:37,500
Sorry, Day. I never thought about that.

569
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:52,375
Are you okay?

570
00:42:52,958 --> 00:42:54,000
May.

571
00:42:55,291 --> 00:42:57,500
May? May, what's wrong?

572
00:43:02,041 --> 00:43:03,458
What are you saying?

573
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,875
I'm told you work long hours,

574
00:43:07,416 --> 00:43:10,458
so perhaps you didn't notice
her condition deteriorating.

575
00:43:11,875 --> 00:43:13,958
We could have avoided these complications

576
00:43:14,458 --> 00:43:16,625
if we had caught it earlier.

577
00:44:20,750 --> 00:44:22,250
<i>Time's up.</i>

578
00:44:22,875 --> 00:44:26,041
<i>The answer is Son.</i>

579
00:44:26,125 --> 00:44:28,625
Oh, our Ladies' Lotto contestant.

580
00:44:28,708 --> 00:44:30,166
<i>That's the way it is, though.</i>

581
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:33,666
If you really love him,
you need to know him better than that.

582
00:44:37,875 --> 00:44:42,708
<i>Fifteen of The Ladies</i>
<i>have qualified for the next round.</i>

583
00:45:01,250 --> 00:45:05,791
<i>Even if there's a .00001% chance,</i>

584
00:45:05,875 --> 00:45:07,958
<i>I'm going to fight because I'm a fighter.</i>

585
00:45:08,708 --> 00:45:11,708
<i>If I'm no longer here,</i>
<i>then you won't be lonely.</i>

586
00:45:11,791 --> 00:45:13,625
<i>May, don't talk like that.</i>

587
00:45:17,208 --> 00:45:18,958
It's gonna be okay, Day.

588
00:45:43,625 --> 00:45:47,791
<i>The Ladies who answered</i>
<i>the final question incorrectly</i>

589

<i>will have a second chance</i>

590
00:45:54,083 --> 00:45:57,583
Oh, there's really something special
about this year.

591
00:45:58,583 --> 00:46:01,166
<i>If things are already this intense</i>
<i>in the audition round,</i>

592
00:46:01,250 --> 00:46:07,083
who knows where this season
of <i>Ready, Set, Love </i>will go next<i>?</i>

593
00:46:07,166 --> 00:46:08,708
-Huh? I made it?
-<i>Stay tuned!</i>

594
00:46:08,791 --> 00:46:09,708
How'd I make it?

595
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Simple.

596
00:46:21,083 --> 00:46:22,666
Two, three, four,

597
00:46:22,750 --> 00:46:24,708
five, six, seven, eight.

598
00:46:26,875 --> 00:46:29,666
-All right, you guys ready?
-Ready.

599
00:46:29,750 --> 00:46:31,041
-Yes.
-Everyone with me.

600
00:46:31,125 --> 00:46:32,708
Three, two, one.

601
00:46:32,791 --> 00:46:34,166
There's no way I'm dancing.

602
00:46:35,875 --> 00:46:37,875
Not like that. No way.

603
00:46:38,958 --> 00:46:40,625
I better <i>not </i>see you dancing.

604
00:46:41,416 --> 00:46:44,708
Let's go! Five, four, three, two, one.

605
00:46:44,791 --> 00:46:48,125
Yeah!

606
00:46:54,958 --> 00:46:57,208
Our next game is Spin Date.

607
00:46:57,291 --> 00:47:00,125
Cross between Blind Date and Speed Date.

608
00:47:00,208 --> 00:47:02,000
<i>Each Gentleman chooses a room</i>

609
00:47:02,083 --> 00:47:05,666
<i>and has three minutes</i>
<i>to talk to whichever Lady is inside.</i>

610
00:47:10,833 --> 00:47:14,208
<i>The Gentlemen can choose</i>
<i>to perform the I Save You move</i>

611

<i>to send their date to the next round.</i>

612
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:19,750
Each Gentleman can only choose
one Lady to save,

613
00:47:19,833 --> 00:47:21,541
and for the rest, it's good night.

614
00:47:24,958 --> 00:47:27,583
<i>The chosen Ladies</i>
<i>will receive a smartwatch</i>

615

Okay.

619
00:48:20,750 --> 00:48:22,500
I just love your work. Heh.

620
00:48:22,583 --> 00:48:24,500
It's amazing. Heh.

621
00:48:24,583 --> 00:48:27,958
<i>Ladies</i>,

Hello, hello?

Anyone in there?

626
00:49:40,541 --> 00:49:42,875
<i>The Gentlemen</i>

Oh! Why wasn't I chosen?

628
00:49:56,875 --> 00:50:00,458
-Ooh, she very quickly dropped that act.
-Aww.

629

Why? Why not me?

Hey, Son, what's your favorite color?

634
00:50:22,583 --> 00:50:23,541
Red.

635
00:50:31,583 --> 00:50:35,708
<i>Max is the first of The Gentlemen</i>

Well…
…maybe I'll get you something red.

638
00:50:47,666 --> 00:50:52,041
<i>It looks like two of our Gentlemen</i>

Hey, Almond hasn't chosen anyone.

643
00:51:08,333 --> 00:51:10,041
I wonder if he has somebody in mind.

644
00:51:10,125 --> 00:51:10,958
Hm.

645
00:51:14,208 --> 00:51:16,166
Where are you, Lotto Girl?

646
00:51:47,166 --> 00:51:49,375
The Ice Prince. Bad luck.

647
00:51:49,458 --> 00:51:51,000
Our Lotto Girl.

648
00:51:51,541 --> 00:51:53,458
She had a pretty good run.

649

Oh, you're so good-looking.

651
00:52:19,458 --> 00:52:21,041
A lot more so in the flesh.

652
00:52:24,125 --> 00:52:25,083
Hello again.

653
00:52:26,666 --> 00:52:30,666
Uh, so, uh, you remember me?

654
00:52:30,750 --> 00:52:31,791
Huh?

655
00:52:31,875 --> 00:52:33,958
How do they know each other?

656
00:52:43,125 --> 00:52:44,375
Do you know what that is?

657
00:52:47,875 --> 00:52:50,583
Mm… a person.

658
00:52:52,083 --> 00:52:52,958
That's not it.

659
00:52:53,666 --> 00:52:55,416
It's the sign for male.

660
00:52:57,708 --> 00:53:00,333
Oh right. Yeah, yeah.

661
00:53:00,416 --> 00:53:02,958
I thought it looked familiar. Yeah.

662
00:53:07,125 --> 00:53:08,125
And what about that?

663
00:53:09,166 --> 00:53:11,708
Do you know what that is?

664
00:53:16,041 --> 00:53:17,250
Uh…

665
00:53:18,416 --> 00:53:20,541
I've seen one somewhere, I think.

666
00:53:20,625 --> 00:53:22,583
-It's a toilet for men.
-Uh…

667
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
-Hm?
-Oh…

668
00:53:27,083 --> 00:53:29,958
Right, yeah. A toilet for men.

669
00:53:32,833 --> 00:53:35,375
Uh, look, you completely misunderstood.

670
00:53:36,541 --> 00:53:39,958
Outside, in the city,
we don't have separate bathrooms.

671
00:53:40,625 --> 00:53:44,375
That's why I didn't know
you were about to, uh, do that.

672
00:53:45,208 --> 00:53:46,500
Okay, look.

673
00:53:46,583 --> 00:53:48,791
Next time you see that sign in a restroom,

674
00:53:49,666 --> 00:53:50,750
go back out.

675
00:53:51,375 --> 00:53:53,875
And, most importantly,
don't stand there staring.

676
00:53:55,291 --> 00:53:56,458
It's rude.

677
00:54:00,250 --> 00:54:01,083
Got it.

678
00:54:01,583 --> 00:54:05,125
Oh, how embarrassing. We're live on air.

679
00:54:09,750 --> 00:54:11,833
So listen.

680
00:54:12,375 --> 00:54:13,625
I'm sorry about earlier.

681
00:54:14,333 --> 00:54:17,000
Like, I'm really sorry.

682
00:54:17,875 --> 00:54:21,125
And… so would you choose me?

683
00:54:22,708 --> 00:54:24,416
I've got to get to the next round.

684
00:54:25,041 --> 00:54:25,875
I can't do that.

685
00:54:26,958 --> 00:54:30,958
If I help you through, then won't you just
spy on my friends peeing?

686
00:54:31,625 --> 00:54:32,791
Oh, come on!

687
00:54:32,875 --> 00:54:36,208
I already told you that was an accident,
and I'm not a stalker.

688
00:54:42,750 --> 00:54:45,291
<i>One minute remaining.</i>

689
00:54:59,541 --> 00:55:01,375
Son, I need to win this.

690
00:55:02,375 --> 00:55:04,166
I need to marry somebody.

691
00:55:09,250 --> 00:55:11,083
So I can go live in The Family.

692
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,750
Could you help me do that?

693
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,375
The thing you want,

694
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,000
it won't happen.

695
00:55:36,708 --> 00:55:38,208
You don't belong here.

696
00:55:38,791 --> 00:55:39,916
Go back home.

697
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:32,833
<i>Time's up.</i>

698
00:56:35,541 --> 00:56:37,125

-Hey!
-Sorry.

700
00:56:45,666 --> 00:56:46,791
Where the hell is he going?

701
00:56:58,666 --> 00:57:01,916
-Where are you going?
-I'm going back home. Go away.

702
00:57:02,958 --> 00:57:04,625
Um, stay.

703
00:57:05,416 --> 00:57:06,750
What are you on about?

704
00:57:09,041 --> 00:57:11,083
Ow! Let go of me!

705
00:57:11,166 --> 00:57:13,541
I said I'm leaving, okay?

706
00:57:39,583 --> 00:57:40,958
Hurry up, Son, come on!

707
00:57:41,041 --> 00:57:43,791
It has to be official
if you want her in the game.

708
00:58:15,166 --> 00:58:16,583
Five, six, seven, eight.

709
00:58:21,750 --> 00:58:22,583
I save you.

710
00:58:24,750 --> 00:58:28,208
<i>Day, our last remaining</i>

711
00:58:28,291 --> 00:58:32,750
<i>has made it through</i>
<i>to the next round of </i>Ready, Set, Love.

712
00:58:32,833 --> 00:58:36,625
I thought he said
that he wasn't gonna dance.

713
00:58:38,958 --> 00:58:40,416
It's amazing.

714
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:44,041
The #SONDAY needs to be trending.

715
00:58:44,750 --> 00:58:46,000
Hey, what's going on?

716
00:58:46,083 --> 00:58:48,083
I want everything
you can find on this girl.

717
00:58:48,166 --> 00:58:49,041
Yes, boss.

718
00:58:49,625 --> 00:58:50,625
-Jin.
-Hm?

719
00:58:51,458 --> 00:58:53,291
Is that what you meant before?

720
00:58:53,791 --> 00:58:55,791
Exactly. Mm.

721
00:58:55,875 --> 00:58:59,333
Isn't that something?
A Lotto Girl made it through.

722
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,750
That's my sister.

723
00:59:04,583 --> 00:59:05,625
What are you doing?

724
00:59:16,291 --> 00:59:17,291
Saving your ass.

725
00:59:20,875 --> 00:59:22,000
Saving me?

726
00:59:24,125 --> 00:59:25,958
You wanted to make it through.

00:59:27,916 --> 00:59:29,166

728
00:59:29,250 --> 00:59:32,333
