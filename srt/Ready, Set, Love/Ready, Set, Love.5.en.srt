1
00:00:10,083 --> 00:00:12,125
-I have to go.
-Will I see you again?

2
00:00:16,375 --> 00:00:17,208
Well…

3
00:00:21,416 --> 00:00:22,583
Say you'll come back.

4
00:00:24,166 --> 00:00:25,208
Promise me.

5
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:31,041
Mm.

6
00:00:35,041 --> 00:00:35,875
Well,

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
goodbye, then.

8
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:40,583
Wait.

9
00:00:42,541 --> 00:00:43,875
Forget something?

10
00:00:43,958 --> 00:00:45,458
Oh, um…

11
00:00:46,708 --> 00:00:47,583
Thank you.

12
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:32,416
Well, what do we do now?

13
00:01:34,083 --> 00:01:35,125
Run away?

14
00:01:46,416 --> 00:01:47,541
It's crazy.

15
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,958
For us to get away,

16
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:52,416
we have to go back in.

17
00:01:53,625 --> 00:01:55,416
-Really?
-Yeah.

18
00:01:56,458 --> 00:01:58,166
If we run to save ourselves,

19
00:01:59,125 --> 00:02:00,708
then the system doesn't change.

20
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:05,791
That's right.

21
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,083
I wanna help my friends.

22
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:13,375
They should know the truth about The Farm.

23
00:02:18,833 --> 00:02:19,708
Hey.

24
00:02:21,625 --> 00:02:23,750
Chun told me about City Ground.

25
00:02:23,833 --> 00:02:27,666
He said they have an operative
working on the show.

26
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:29,083
Hm.

27
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:31,583
Are you sure?

28
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:32,708
Mm.

29
00:02:35,416 --> 00:02:36,291
Do you know who?

30
00:02:39,541 --> 00:02:40,583
Let me think.

31
00:02:42,166 --> 00:02:43,041
Christmas?

32
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:47,750
Or New Year?

33
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:48,833
Halloween…

34
00:02:48,916 --> 00:02:49,750
Valentine!

35
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:58,625
You met Chun,
and now you want to help City Ground.

36
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,000
And you!

37
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:06,458
You know that the competition is rigged,

38
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:10,708
and you're close
to the owner of Eve Capital

39
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:12,833
because you've been
in her house a few times.

40
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:19,375
We've got the spies.
Now we just need evidence.

41
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:24,083
It shouldn't be hard at all,
now that you guys are all in.

42
00:03:25,041 --> 00:03:25,916
Yes!

43
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,458
I get it.

44
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:38,500
Yeah, so that's the reason
you wanted to work here.

45
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:40,708
Mm, yeah.

46
00:03:41,625 --> 00:03:43,458
I'm doing it for City Ground.

47
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:45,166
No other reason.

48
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:48,958
Val, you should have told me
right at the start.

49
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:51,708
Then I could have helped you with this.

50
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:53,416
Day, I'm sorry.

51
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:56,000
You know you're my best friend.

52
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:57,541
The thing is,

53
00:03:58,166 --> 00:04:00,833
the fewer people who know this,
the safer it is.

54
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:02,708
For you as well.

55
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:06,291
We're on the same side now.

56
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:07,958
If you need anything, I'm here.

57
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:10,958
Mm, okay.

58
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:14,375
I can deal with a show
that gets people hooked.

59
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:20,250
Except when they take away children
from their mothers,

60
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:21,500
that's criminal.

61
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:24,500
So just you wait.

62
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:26,375
Whatever they're hiding,

63
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:28,958
I'm gonna find all of it.

64
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,833
Ha!

65
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:37,291
Ha!

66
00:04:39,541 --> 00:04:40,458
All in?

67
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:43,000

<i>Hansel and Gretel</i>
<i>lived happily on the cheery farmland,</i>

82
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:04,333
<i>until one day,</i>
<i>Witches invaded their village.</i>

83
00:06:04,416 --> 00:06:08,000
<i>They began eating the Villagers</i>
<i>and pretended to be them.</i>

84
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:09,958
<i>They even kidnapped Hansel.</i>

85
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:15,458
<i>On moonless nights,</i>
<i>there are Witches hiding among us.</i>

86
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:19,625
<i>And if we can't figure out</i>
<i>who the disguised Witches are,</i>

87
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:22,291
<i>all of the Villagers will be eaten.</i>

88
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:25,166
Hello, and welcome back to…

89
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:27,625
<i>Ready, Set, Love.</i>

90
00:06:27,708 --> 00:06:32,333
I'm excited to tell you about
this week's game, Hansel and Gretel.

91
00:06:36,958 --> 00:06:40,041
Some of the players are Witches,
and the rest of them are Villagers.

92
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:44,208
<i>The Villagers' team</i>
<i>need to complete six minigames</i>

93
00:06:44,291 --> 00:06:47,791
<i>to collect the items they need</i>
<i>to defeat the Witches</i>

94
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:51,625
<i>and figure out</i>
<i>who the disguised Witches are.</i>

95
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:53,791
<i>As for the Witches,</i>

96
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:55,875
<i>they'll need to keep</i>
<i>their identities hidden</i>

97
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:59,125
<i>as they attempt to eat the Villagers</i>
<i>without being caught.</i>

98
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:03,208
<i>The Villagers' team will win</i>
<i>if they can complete the minigames</i>

99
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:05,750
<i>and catch all the disguised Witches.</i>

100
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:10,458
<i>The Witches' team will win if they manage</i>
<i>to grab and eat all the Villagers,</i>

101
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:12,958
<i>or complete their counter-mission.</i>

102
00:07:13,541 --> 00:07:16,666
Hearing the rules, the Villagers' team
have a hard time ahead.

103
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:20,166
Complete the minigames,
be careful not to get eaten,

104
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:22,541
and figure out who each Witch is.

105
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:25,500
But the Witches have a hard time too.

106
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:28,208
They've got to take the Villagers
out of the game,

107
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,458
but nobody can see them.

108
00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:32,916
It's essential they cover up
what they're doing.

109
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:37,000
The more I think about it,
I wouldn't make a good Witch, you know,

110
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:39,916
because I couldn't
keep the lies up.

111
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:45,208
<i>Contestants,</i>
<i>please check your assigned roles.</i>

112
00:07:53,416 --> 00:07:54,750
<i>All right.</i>

113
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:57,541
<i>Everyone has been given</i>
<i>their assigned roles.</i>

114
00:07:57,625 --> 00:07:59,916
<i>There are three Witches among them.</i>

115
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:04,041
<i>All the Witches know</i>
<i>who the other Witches are,</i>

116
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:07,166
but the Villagers' team have no idea.

117
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:09,791
This is something I apply to my own life.

118
00:08:09,875 --> 00:08:14,250
You have to do away with negative people,
just like these Witches.

119
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:17,916
There's a special reward
for this challenge.

120
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,291
The Lady who comes first

121
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:24,041
can bring their Gentleman home
to Mom and Dad.

122
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:29,250
Oh! Meeting the parents
is an important step.

123
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:35,708
Eve Capital's boss
wants Chanel and Son to be together,

124
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:39,833
and the show's rigged
according to what she wants.

125
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:43,000
We need to prove it
and release it on socials.

126
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,458
The whole country
will be talking about it.

127
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:52,458
The next challenge could help us,
if Chanel wins.

128
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,125
Think you can do that?

129
00:08:58,083 --> 00:08:58,916
Yeah.

130
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:01,125
We'll make sure Chanel wins.

131
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,791
<i>Let the game begin.</i>

132
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:08,166
<i>Twelve Ladies have made it</i>
<i>this far in the competition,</i>

133
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:11,375
<i>but three will be going home</i>
<i>after this game.</i>

134
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:13,458
<i>Let's see what happens.</i>

135
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,791
Day, Day.

136
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:25,250
Are we all Villagers?

137
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:29,208
-Yeah.
-Mm.

138
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:31,166
Now what?

139
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:33,708
How do we know which people are Witches?

140
00:09:39,708 --> 00:09:41,416
<i>Ooh, watch out.</i>

141
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:44,500
They didn't waste any time.
It's already begun.

142
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:50,958
-Hey.
-Mm?

143
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:52,958
You think we'll be able to pull this off?

144
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:55,291
Not sure.

145
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:58,583
I think it could be a big deal,

146
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:00,375
what we're doing right now.

147
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:03,375
It feels like
we're saving the world, right?

148
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,750
-Really?
-Mm.

149
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:08,291
Not for me.

150
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:10,208
For my part,

151
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:12,875
I just want us to be together.

152
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:23,291
Why don't you get a room, hm?

153
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,083
Eavesdropping is rude.

154
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:29,208
I wasn't eavesdropping. I'm right here.

155
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:31,333
-Yes, you were. You're a big liar!
-What do you mean?

156
00:10:31,416 --> 00:10:33,250
That's not true. You're a liar!

157
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:44,000
<i>The rules state</i>
<i>if a player finds a body,</i>

158
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:45,791
<i>they can call a meeting.</i>

159
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:49,333
<i>Khaopoon found Joy's body.</i>
<i>A meeting has been called.</i>

160
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:53,333
The Villager who's caught and eaten
must be silent

161
00:10:53,416 --> 00:10:56,875
and not move until somebody finds them.

162
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:58,583
Seriously?

163
00:10:58,666 --> 00:10:59,750
Oh.

164
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:05,708
Now let's see if our Villagers
are able to figure out who the Witch is.

165
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:15,708
Um, I think I saw
someone sneaking toward Joy.

166
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:18,333
-Who was it?
-Oh!

167
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,708
Um, it was…

168
00:11:21,416 --> 00:11:24,500
um… um, maybe a man.

169
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:28,791
It was dark. I couldn't see.

170
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,208
So, one of you two could be a Witch.

171
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:36,250
Hey, it isn't me.

172
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:37,458
It's not me.

173
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:41,125
Kaew did it.

174
00:11:42,041 --> 00:11:44,208
Now she's trying
to point the finger at us.

175
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:47,750
<i>Villagers, who is the Witch?</i>

176
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:49,041
<i>Please cast your votes.</i>

177
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,083
<i>Hmm.</i>

178
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:54,041
This game could benefit
from another level of deception,

179
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:55,250
like a new character.

180
00:11:56,166 --> 00:11:59,250
I wonder what team Chanel will be on?

181
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:03,541
I think they're going to set up Chanel
to have an advantage,

182
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:06,166
something that will set her apart
as special.

183
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:11,791
She will be Gretel.

184
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:13,916
<i>That's right.</i>

185
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,541
<i>One of the players</i>
<i>has been assigned Gretel,</i>

186
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:19,125
<i>and knows the identities</i>
<i>of all the Witches</i>,

187
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:20,875
<i>except the Invisible Witch.</i>

188
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:23,416
<i>Gretel can give hints</i>
<i>to the other Villagers,</i>

189
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,000
but they've got to be careful,

190
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:29,625
because the Invisible Witch
is allowed to guess who Gretel is.

191
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:33,625
If the guess is correct,
the Witches' team win the game.

192
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:39,416
<i>Time's up.</i>

193
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,875
<i>Kaew has been voted off.</i>

194
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:43,625
<i>Please exit the game.</i>

195
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:46,791
<i>Kaew is a Villager.</i>

196
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:51,791
What? I was wrong.

197
00:12:52,541 --> 00:12:54,833
Okay, then it was Max.

198
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:58,750
-Hey, hey, hey. Why do you say that?
-Ooh, you all saw him lay hands.

199
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:00,000
-You're a Witch.
-You are!

200
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:01,583
-You are! You are!
-You're the Witch!

201
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:07,458
I was nearly able
to get myself a real husband.

202
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:15,333
Then it has to be Almond, Max, or Jin.

203
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:18,291
Which one do you think is the Witch?

204
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:23,916
I can't tell,
but we should stay away from them, hm?

205
00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:27,208
<i>Recommencing the game.</i>

206
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:31,500
Come on, Chal, let's go.

207
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:35,833
-What are you doing?
-What about you?

208
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:40,125
You might, uh, be a Witch.

209
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:41,791
Come on, Chal.

210
00:13:42,708 --> 00:13:45,125
Uh, okay. Wait, wait, wait.

211
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:49,083
Now, why don't we all just go together?

212
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:50,375
Hm?

213
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:54,041
Minigame.

214
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:56,875
The group presses the button
for 10 seconds.

215
00:13:58,125 --> 00:14:01,583
Hm. It's easy. We just need four of us.

216
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:05,583
Then let's get started.

217
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:08,833
Let's get started.

218
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:10,875
Huh?

219
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:15,041
But I said it first.

220
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:17,250
-You ready?
-I'm ready.

221
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:20,083
-One, two--
-Wait.

222
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:25,083
All right.

223
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:28,333
One, two, three.

224
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:35,833
<i>Ten, nine, eight,</i>
<i>seven, six, five,</i>

225
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:41,708
<i>four, three, two, one.</i>

226
00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:46,375
<i>The Villagers</i>
<i>have cleared the first minigame.</i>

227
00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:48,625
<i>You have received</i>
<i>the Witch-Defeating Sword.</i>

228
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:54,583
<i>The Witches are brewing poison.</i>

229
00:14:54,666 --> 00:14:58,500
<i>The Villagers need to clear</i>
<i>the Shock Coil Challenge minigame</i>

230
00:14:58,583 --> 00:14:59,416
<i>to stop them.</i>

231
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:03,208
-Day, are you okay?
-Uh, yeah, I'm okay.

232
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:05,250
Go check on Chanel. Hurry.

233
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:06,208
Okay.

234
00:15:08,416 --> 00:15:09,375
Come with me.

235
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,208
-Who's there? Who's there?
-Huh?

236
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:20,125
Hey!

237
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:21,416
-Who? What?
-Hey!

238
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,291
-Hey, who is that? Hey--
-Huh?

239
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:24,833
-Day?
-Uh, Almond.

240
00:15:24,916 --> 00:15:27,375
Oh, uh, how's it going?
Glad I found you.

241
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:30,000
-We should get out of here. Come on.
-Uh, uh…

242
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:31,791
Uh…

243
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:42,708
Hey, we're here. Come on.

244
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:52,166
"To extinguish the poison cauldron,

245
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:56,208
you must guide the ring
without touching the electrified core."

246
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:00,083
Okay, let's start.

247
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,625
You good? All right.

248
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:16,375
So the plan is for Chanel to win?

249
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:18,000
Huh?

250
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:26,333
It's all right.

251
00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:27,625
I can help.

252
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:30,291
Let's start over.

253
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:32,083
Oh, okay.

254
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:39,916
Oh, we made it, Chal.

255
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,875
It's okay. It's me.

256
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:46,250
What are you doing here?

257
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:52,000
<i>The Villagers have cleared</i>
<i>the Shock Coil Challenge minigame.</i>

258
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:54,916
<i>The poison cauldron has been extinguished.</i>

259
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,291
I thought you were Son.

260
00:16:57,333 --> 00:16:59,041
Just relax.

261
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:03,333
We should stick together.
I'll keep you safe. Trust me.

262
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:04,958
Hey!

263
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:10,125
Have you considered that…
I might be a Witch?

264
00:17:11,958 --> 00:17:14,250
Maybe I don't care.

265
00:17:15,416 --> 00:17:17,375
But if you are a Witch, then…

266
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,083
…come and get me.

267
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:29,208
Come on. Let's go.

268
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:32,625
Hi there, Max!

269
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:42,208
-Hey, Almond.
-Hm?

270
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:44,875
Um, how did you know about our plan?

271
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:48,291
Once we finish the game,
I'll explain.

272
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:52,666
Okay. Right now,
Son and Paper are with Chanel.

273
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:57,291
With you on board,
we might even come out on top after all.

274
00:17:58,375 --> 00:17:59,458
Mm.

275
00:18:05,958 --> 00:18:07,208
Hey, watch it!

276
00:18:07,916 --> 00:18:09,750
Stop kicking me!

277
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:11,291
It hurts, okay?

278
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:14,333
Venus, I'm sorry.

279
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:16,583
I didn't see you there.

280
00:18:17,291 --> 00:18:20,833
I'm not sure
that was an accident from our Lotto Girl.

281
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:24,333
I'll call it.

282
00:18:32,416 --> 00:18:35,166
<i>Now the Villagers have their chance.</i>

283
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:39,916
They need to figure out
which of the players are hunting them.

284
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,791
A simple deduction.

285
00:18:42,458 --> 00:18:45,291
-It was none other than…
<i>-</i>Sherlock Holmes's dumb, cousin.

286
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:46,875
…Day.

287
00:18:47,875 --> 00:18:49,458
Hey, it's not me.

288
00:18:49,541 --> 00:18:51,750
It's not, Mr. Holmes.

289
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:53,541
I'm not a Witch.

290
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:56,791
Oh, I see now.

291
00:18:56,875 --> 00:18:59,000
You killed her
and then called the meeting.

292
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:02,333
What? Clearly you're no critical thinker.

293
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:05,625
It isn't Day. I know that. Can confirm.

294
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:06,541
Hm!

295
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:08,708
Wait. You did it.

296
00:19:09,708 --> 00:19:11,166
The Gentleman who's a Witch.

297
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:15,000
You thought you could fool me.

298
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:18,625
That's right, that's right!
Paper is the Witch.

299
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:21,083
Uh, there's no way that I am.

300
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:22,416
Damn it, Max!

301
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:27,541
If you don't truly know,
then don't talk such nonsense.

302
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:28,791
Yeah, listen to him.

303
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:31,541
-What are you saying?
-You're swaying people.

304
00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:32,458
No, I'm not.

305
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:34,208
You're swaying people's thoughts.

306
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:36,708
-It's obvious.
-How is it obvious?

307
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:38,625
-He did it.
-You're imagining things.

308
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:41,166
This all seems
just like brotherly bickering.

309
00:19:42,708 --> 00:19:45,166
-Am I wrong?
-No! No, no, no.

310
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,625
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

311
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:47,708
Day didn't do it.

312
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:56,041
I'm sure of that.

313
00:19:58,875 --> 00:19:59,916
I think it's Jin.

314
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:03,708
You scratch your nose
when you lie, don't you?

315
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:11,541
You're right, Almond. He does.

316
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:14,083
Whoa! You got him, Al.

317
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:17,083
Oh, it was Jin. You're such a liar.

318
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:18,000
Uh…

319
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:26,041
You deceived me,
but I'm too smart to be fooled for long.

320
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:27,916
You thought it was me.

321
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,208
Admit that you're the Witch.

322
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:58,166
Admit it.

323
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,875
<i>Jin has been voted off.</i>

324
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:04,875
<i>Please exit the game.</i>

325
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:09,250
Why, God?

326
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:10,583
-What did he say?
-Don't know.

327
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:13,291
<i>Jin is a Witch.</i>

328
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:18,500
Oh, good job, Almond! Congratulations!

329
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:22,666
-Bye, Sherlock Holmes.
-Bye-bye.

330
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,375
Hey, Chal. Do you think
only one of the Witches was a guy?

331
00:21:45,458 --> 00:21:46,875
<i>Nina is dead.</i>

332
00:21:47,666 --> 00:21:50,208
-Why?
-<i>Opal has been voted off.</i>

333
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:53,291
<i>-Opal is a Villager.</i>
-Hey, why hasn't Gretel helped out?

334
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:55,666
How about dropping some hints to the team?

335
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:58,125
Well, if it were me,

336
00:21:58,208 --> 00:22:02,166
I'd do all that I can to stop
the Invisible Witch from finding out,

337
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:04,166
or it's game over for the team.

338
00:22:04,791 --> 00:22:08,291
But if they continue to keep losing people
the way it's been going,

339
00:22:08,375 --> 00:22:11,125
then it's game over for the team anyway.

340
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:15,583
<i>Orn has been voted off.</i>
<i>Orn is a Witch.</i>

341
00:22:15,666 --> 00:22:16,666
Ooh.

342
00:22:22,166 --> 00:22:25,208
<i>Oh no. Almond died in the minigame.</i>

343
00:22:25,291 --> 00:22:27,750
<i>And Max, Bovy, and Chanel</i>
<i>were the only ones there.</i>

344
00:22:27,833 --> 00:22:29,500
No! I'm dead.

345
00:22:29,583 --> 00:22:30,875
<i>Who is the Witch?</i>

346
00:22:30,958 --> 00:22:33,333
Yes! Demonstrate your will.

347
00:22:33,833 --> 00:22:37,000
Blessed Illuminati, protect the Witch!

348
00:22:37,083 --> 00:22:39,083
Mm!

349
00:22:49,916 --> 00:22:52,458
<i>Chanel has called a meeting.</i>

350
00:22:53,166 --> 00:22:54,750
You were the only one there.

351
00:22:55,666 --> 00:22:56,666
Who was it, Chal?

352
00:22:57,541 --> 00:22:58,750
I told you already.

353
00:22:59,875 --> 00:23:01,208
I'm not a Witch, Chanel.

354
00:23:04,125 --> 00:23:05,208
Neither am I.

355
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,833
I don't care about the game.

356
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:14,250
I wanna be with you.

357
00:23:16,958 --> 00:23:20,375
Chal, how long have we been friends?

358
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,458
You can see into my heart.

359
00:23:24,125 --> 00:23:25,791
I never could lie to you.

360
00:23:32,708 --> 00:23:35,958
<i>Time's up. Cast your votes.</i>

361
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:38,291
I think…

362
00:23:44,416 --> 00:23:46,083
Max is the Witch.

363
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:58,958
<i>Max has been voted off.</i>

364
00:23:59,041 --> 00:24:01,333
<i>Max is a Villager.</i>

365
00:24:04,708 --> 00:24:07,458
And now Max is out of the game.

366
00:24:07,541 --> 00:24:11,000
Oh! So Bovy is the Invisible Witch.

367
00:24:11,083 --> 00:24:14,875
Chanel's best friend is now her enemy.

368
00:24:14,958 --> 00:24:18,375
Bovy wants Max, but Max only wants Chanel.

369
00:24:18,458 --> 00:24:23,000
Even the closest friendships
can be torn apart when love is involved.

370
00:24:37,416 --> 00:24:38,541
You're cute.

371
00:24:39,041 --> 00:24:40,625
I can't look away.

372
00:24:42,125 --> 00:24:43,541
Cheers!

373
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,333
<i>Recommencing the game.</i>

374
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,708
-Hey, Son?
-Yeah?

375
00:25:10,791 --> 00:25:11,875
Bovy's here now!

376
00:25:14,375 --> 00:25:15,500
Get out of here.

377
00:25:15,583 --> 00:25:16,916
We'll keep the Witch away.

378
00:25:18,125 --> 00:25:19,333
I'm counting on you.

379
00:25:20,083 --> 00:25:22,291
Okay.

380
00:25:28,166 --> 00:25:29,958
-I'm ready.
-Okay.

381
00:25:55,541 --> 00:25:59,583
<i>Day, Mako, and Khaopoon</i>
<i>have cleared the Ring Toss minigame</i>

382
00:25:59,666 --> 00:26:02,416
<i>and received</i>
<i>the Witch-Defeating Spell Book.</i>

383
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,833
<i>Only one minigame remains.</i>

384
00:26:04,916 --> 00:26:06,000
Yes!

385
00:26:13,291 --> 00:26:14,958
Oh! Hm.

386
00:26:25,916 --> 00:26:26,916
Paper.

387
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:27,875
Huh?

388
00:26:50,916 --> 00:26:51,958
Just needed one.

389
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:55,666
One body. Now we can call a meeting.

390
00:27:01,208 --> 00:27:02,791
What?

391
00:27:02,875 --> 00:27:05,083
Oh, mine looks like it's a bit sluggish.

392
00:27:05,166 --> 00:27:08,375
We both might have
to power up a little first.

393
00:27:21,791 --> 00:27:22,833
Shit.

394
00:27:25,625 --> 00:27:27,041
Killed by Bovy.

395
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:33,750
You betrayed me.

396
00:27:34,958 --> 00:27:37,791
Dude, please forgive me.

397
00:27:53,541 --> 00:27:55,833
What are you doing, Lotto? Move.

398
00:27:59,458 --> 00:28:00,333
Die, then.

399
00:28:07,916 --> 00:28:09,750
Lotto, hands off me!

400
00:28:09,833 --> 00:28:11,958
I thought you were friends with Chanel.

401
00:28:12,041 --> 00:28:14,583
More like a frenemy.

402
00:28:14,666 --> 00:28:18,500
She knows that I'm into Max,
and now she's getting cozy with him.

403
00:28:18,583 --> 00:28:20,750
I wanna kick her into that wall!

404
00:28:21,958 --> 00:28:25,125
Bovy, calm down,
or take your anger out on me instead.

405
00:28:25,208 --> 00:28:26,791
She's dead.

406
00:28:27,958 --> 00:28:30,083
Bovy, think about
all the good things

407
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:31,750
your friend has done for you.

408
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:35,458
Anything come to mind?

409
00:28:35,541 --> 00:28:37,583
Now, think carefully.

410
00:28:48,041 --> 00:28:50,291
Okay, relax, yeah?

411
00:28:50,375 --> 00:28:53,583
Think of the things
Chanel has done for you.

412
00:28:53,666 --> 00:28:54,708
Ping-pong!

413
00:28:59,166 --> 00:29:03,208
Her bitchiness, and even her bossiness,
I can handle.

414
00:29:04,166 --> 00:29:07,666
Except when it comes to guys,
I will give it all that I've got.

415
00:29:09,333 --> 00:29:13,458
-Take that!
-Oh no!

416
00:29:17,541 --> 00:29:19,333
Watch out, Chanel!

417
00:29:19,416 --> 00:29:20,666
She's coming!

418
00:29:27,916 --> 00:29:30,416
When you clear this challenge,
you'll win, huh?

419
00:29:33,166 --> 00:29:34,000
Yes.

420
00:29:35,416 --> 00:29:37,208
And didn't you say that you'd help?

421
00:29:43,666 --> 00:29:45,458
I already helped you a lot.

422
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:56,833
I thought you knew my situation
better than that.

423
00:30:01,625 --> 00:30:03,208
You know me and Max.

424
00:30:06,083 --> 00:30:08,083
It's something that can never happen.

425
00:30:13,833 --> 00:30:15,375
No matter how I feel.

426
00:30:52,958 --> 00:30:55,916
<i>The Villagers</i>
<i>have cleared the final minigame</i>

427
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,708
<i>and rescued Hansel.</i>

428
00:31:02,375 --> 00:31:05,083
That's enough!

429
00:31:24,166 --> 00:31:28,416
<i>The Invisible Witch</i>
<i>now has a chance to guess who Gretel is.</i>

430
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:42,708
Who do you think is Gretel?

431
00:31:44,125 --> 00:31:46,083
-It's gotta be Chanel, right?
-Mm.

432
00:31:46,166 --> 00:31:49,583
Because she guessed all of the Witches,
except Bovy.

433
00:31:50,333 --> 00:31:51,166
Hm.

434
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:54,833
-I mean, it makes sense. I'm with you.
-Mm. Mm-hmm.

435
00:31:54,916 --> 00:31:58,625
Looks like a win for the Witches' team.

436
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:00,000
You got this, Bovy.

437
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,333
I'm sure that Mako is Gretel.

438
00:32:36,208 --> 00:32:38,250
<i>Bovy answered incorrectly.</i>

439
00:32:38,333 --> 00:32:40,375
<i>Chanel is Gretel.</i>

440
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:42,958
<i>The Villagers win the game.</i>

441
00:32:43,458 --> 00:32:45,500
We won!

442
00:32:45,583 --> 00:32:46,583
Hey!

443
00:32:54,041 --> 00:32:56,458
Aww. That's such a shame.

444
00:32:56,541 --> 00:33:00,500
The search for love is very important,
as all women know,

445
00:33:00,583 --> 00:33:02,458
so it's sad to see.

446
00:33:02,958 --> 00:33:07,541
But also, Bovy is… she's bonkers.

447
00:33:07,625 --> 00:33:10,750
I mean, she might have just messed it up.

448
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:31,875
What kind of game are you playing at?

449
00:33:34,916 --> 00:33:36,333
Explain yourself.

450
00:33:39,791 --> 00:33:42,583
I've only been into Max
for a couple of years.

451
00:33:46,416 --> 00:33:48,541
But you've been in my life forever.

452
00:33:58,958 --> 00:33:59,875
Chal…

453
00:34:01,875 --> 00:34:03,958
it's time you were true to your heart.

454
00:34:10,208 --> 00:34:13,166
I just want you to be happy, Chal.

455
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,916
Oh my God. Stop hugging me.

456
00:34:34,791 --> 00:34:36,875
You let everybody take advantage.

457
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:40,375
You're so simple-minded.

458
00:34:42,041 --> 00:34:44,250
That's why I'm always stuck with you,

459
00:34:44,333 --> 00:34:45,833
never able to get away.

460
00:34:56,625 --> 00:34:57,583
I know that.

461
00:34:58,375 --> 00:34:59,541
You're the greatest.

462
00:35:22,833 --> 00:35:25,333
<i>It's time to choose your dates.</i>

463
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:30,250
<i>Mako stole Venus's points</i>
<i>from the last round.</i>

464
00:35:30,875 --> 00:35:35,750
<i>Tallying the scores from this game,</i>
<i>last round, and popular votes,</i>

465
00:35:35,833 --> 00:35:39,291
<i>The Ladies eliminated are Opal…</i>

466
00:35:42,916 --> 00:35:43,750
<i>…Khaopoon…</i>

467
00:35:45,666 --> 00:35:46,583
<i>…and Joy.</i>

468
00:35:48,333 --> 00:35:49,583
Oh.

469
00:35:49,666 --> 00:35:51,250
Even though Day was killed,

470
00:35:51,333 --> 00:35:54,833
she still has a higher score
than Bovy does

471
00:35:54,916 --> 00:35:56,875
<i>because she was on the winning team,</i>

472
00:35:56,958 --> 00:36:00,458
<i>and she's always been further ahead</i>
<i>on the popular vote.</i>

473
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,750
<i>The Lady who's in the lead</i>
<i>gets to choose her Gentleman first.</i>

474
00:36:04,833 --> 00:36:09,750
And The Gentleman in the lead
gets to pick the trip date first.

475
00:36:09,833 --> 00:36:12,958
I'm interested to see
who Chanel's date is tonight

476
00:36:13,041 --> 00:36:17,458
because she's already been on dates
with Son and with Max, as well.

477
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:20,250
And with each, she had a good time.

478
00:36:20,333 --> 00:36:24,208
<i>Chanel, please step forward</i>
<i>and choose your date.</i>

479
00:36:45,083 --> 00:36:47,791
Hey, what is she doing?

480
00:36:56,958 --> 00:36:59,625
Sorry that I didn't trust you.

481
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:19,833
Let's go out, unless you're tired of me.

482
00:37:45,416 --> 00:37:48,833
<i>The Lady in first place</i>
<i>gets a special reward.</i>

483
00:37:48,916 --> 00:37:52,041
<i>She may bring The Gentleman</i>
<i>to meet her family.</i>

484
00:38:07,291 --> 00:38:08,750
-Hey.
-What?

485
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:12,583
Shh. I'm returning it.

486
00:38:12,666 --> 00:38:14,416
-We did it.
-Great, thanks.

487
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:17,333
-I have to go. Someone's coming.
-Okay, I'll see you later.

488
00:38:19,541 --> 00:38:21,541
What's up, Lotto Girl?

489
00:38:21,625 --> 00:38:23,125
You went all out today.

490
00:38:23,708 --> 00:38:25,541
Yeah.

491
00:38:25,625 --> 00:38:29,208
Of course you'd do your best
with your sister's life at stake.

492
00:38:30,583 --> 00:38:31,833
It must be difficult growing up

493
00:38:31,916 --> 00:38:34,583
without all the opportunities
that The Farm offers.

494
00:38:34,666 --> 00:38:35,916
I understand that.

495
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,958
So seize every opportunity,
and give it your all.

496
00:38:39,541 --> 00:38:41,916
Focus on the things you want.

497
00:38:43,333 --> 00:38:45,583
And give it your best shot.

498
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:58,166
I should never
have gotten you involved.

499
00:38:58,666 --> 00:38:59,708
I'm all right.

500
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:02,041
Just focus on your mission.

501
00:39:02,791 --> 00:39:04,875
I can handle looking after me.

502
00:39:05,458 --> 00:39:06,791
Don't worry, okay?

503
00:39:07,958 --> 00:39:09,750
Day, you're in a bit of a mess now.

504
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:14,625
You could have just sat back,
always winning the public vote,

505
00:39:15,833 --> 00:39:20,166
ending up with one of The Gentlemen
and living happily on The Farm.

506
00:39:25,833 --> 00:39:26,875
Oh yeah.

507
00:39:28,625 --> 00:39:29,500
That's right.

508
00:39:33,333 --> 00:39:37,041
What did you mean
when you said that you're one of us now?

509
00:39:43,166 --> 00:39:45,208
I meant exactly what I said.

510
00:39:50,541 --> 00:39:53,791
<i>The other night,</i>
<i>I heard everything.</i>

511
00:39:54,666 --> 00:39:56,041
I heard the whole plan.

512
00:40:10,291 --> 00:40:11,750
So you're joining us?

513
00:40:12,791 --> 00:40:15,875
Yeah. You guys are my brothers.

514
00:40:15,958 --> 00:40:18,041
I'm here to help.

515
00:40:18,125 --> 00:40:19,791
He's on the team!

516
00:40:23,416 --> 00:40:24,666
Hey, Al.

517
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:27,708
You know, outside isn't comfortable
like The Farm is.

518
00:40:27,791 --> 00:40:29,291
Are you sure about this?

519
00:40:29,375 --> 00:40:31,250
I can't let you go out by yourselves.

520
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,083
I'd be too worried.

521
00:40:35,625 --> 00:40:37,000
All right.

522
00:40:37,083 --> 00:40:38,541
We should probably head back

523
00:40:38,625 --> 00:40:42,041
before anyone figures out
that we're missing.

524
00:41:02,416 --> 00:41:03,500
Here.

525
00:41:03,583 --> 00:41:05,500
This is for you. Try a bit.

526
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:10,083
Mmm!

527
00:41:10,875 --> 00:41:13,041
-What do you think?
-It's really good, actually.

528
00:41:13,125 --> 00:41:14,208
Awesome! Really?

529
00:41:14,291 --> 00:41:16,291
-Mm.
-Yeah!

530
00:41:17,125 --> 00:41:19,208
I've never seen you make Thai desserts.

531
00:41:20,208 --> 00:41:22,250
Well, people can change, can't they?

532
00:41:22,333 --> 00:41:24,083
You should know that, right?

533
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:33,750
I'm sorry, man.

534
00:41:34,541 --> 00:41:36,958
I should have told you everything
from the start.

535
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:39,791
Ah, forget it.

536
00:41:40,875 --> 00:41:44,125
So your necklace matches Day's?

537
00:41:48,708 --> 00:41:49,541
Hm.

538
00:41:50,958 --> 00:41:52,708
So she was the kid you met

539
00:41:53,666 --> 00:41:54,958
the time you escaped.

540
00:42:04,875 --> 00:42:06,333
I'm excited for you.

541
00:42:06,416 --> 00:42:08,958
I just want you to know
I'm happy you found her.

542
00:42:12,708 --> 00:42:14,083
Hey, don't worry.

543
00:42:15,208 --> 00:42:16,333
We're all right.

544
00:42:25,791 --> 00:42:28,083
Well, that's just like Almond,
isn't it?

545
00:42:32,041 --> 00:42:34,125
But you haven't known him very long.

546
00:42:34,208 --> 00:42:37,791
He's the kind of guy who's really strict
when it comes to the rules.

547
00:42:37,875 --> 00:42:39,416
I'm not sure he's with us.

548
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:42,083
Mm-hmm.

549
00:42:42,166 --> 00:42:46,875
Usually, he'd be the guy
who was trying to stop us,

550
00:42:48,750 --> 00:42:50,375
and not the one encouraging us.

551
00:42:55,333 --> 00:42:56,541
Mmm!

552
00:42:57,916 --> 00:42:58,791
Hey, you.

553
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:01,583
We have a reliable big brother
joining our gang.

554
00:43:01,666 --> 00:43:04,250
Can't you say it's a good thing? Huh?

555
00:43:06,666 --> 00:43:07,541
I guess.

556
00:43:07,625 --> 00:43:08,541
Hm!

557
00:43:16,375 --> 00:43:17,583
-Wake up.
-Hm?

558
00:43:18,833 --> 00:43:19,791
Yes?

559
00:43:21,666 --> 00:43:23,916
Bovy likes you. Do you know that?

560
00:43:27,750 --> 00:43:28,583
I know.

561
00:43:30,083 --> 00:43:32,625
Even on Mars, they know.

562
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,333
-Listen.
-Mm?

563
00:43:38,708 --> 00:43:41,125
Bovy's really cute and nice.

564
00:43:41,208 --> 00:43:44,541
You two would really
get along well together.

565
00:43:46,166 --> 00:43:47,000
And you?

566
00:43:48,541 --> 00:43:51,375
You and I get along together.

567
00:43:52,375 --> 00:43:53,541
I like you, Chanel.

568
00:43:53,625 --> 00:43:54,541
Oh…

569
00:43:56,958 --> 00:43:58,375
And you like me too.

570
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:02,875
Okay.

571
00:44:04,583 --> 00:44:06,833
Who is it that likes whom here?

572
00:44:07,416 --> 00:44:10,083
Are all The Gentlemen
so full of themselves?

573
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:15,375
Listen.

574
00:44:16,833 --> 00:44:18,916
Everyone can see it.

575
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,958
Even on Mars,

576
00:44:22,041 --> 00:44:22,875
they know.

577
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,375
You just stop overthinking it,
okay, Meow Meow?

578
00:44:33,125 --> 00:44:35,666
Okay, you've convinced me.

579
00:44:37,208 --> 00:44:38,458
Meow!

580
00:44:40,666 --> 00:44:45,000
Oh, if your many fans
could see you now as Meow Meow,

581
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:48,166
I wonder what they'd think.

582
00:44:51,916 --> 00:44:57,458
They would think
that your cat is back with his owner,

583
00:44:58,541 --> 00:44:59,666
and this time…

584
00:45:01,916 --> 00:45:03,666
Meow Meow's staying forever.

585
00:45:07,541 --> 00:45:08,375
Meow!

586
00:45:13,375 --> 00:45:16,708
So, how am I supposed to get over someone

587
00:45:16,791 --> 00:45:18,208
when they're this cute?

588
00:45:22,083 --> 00:45:23,166
Easy.

589
00:45:23,250 --> 00:45:25,666
Control yourself, and stay away from me.

590
00:45:27,208 --> 00:45:28,166
Wait a minute.

591
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:32,333
You're the one who came to talk to me.

592
00:45:36,791 --> 00:45:40,083
Oh, I get it. You're crazy, huh?

593
00:45:41,375 --> 00:45:44,625
I don't understand
what holds you back.

594
00:45:46,583 --> 00:45:49,291
With Son, I'm okay with losing.

595
00:45:50,916 --> 00:45:52,166
But when it comes to you,

596
00:45:53,916 --> 00:45:55,125
I'll never back down.

597
00:45:56,333 --> 00:45:57,541
And you know it.

598
00:46:03,333 --> 00:46:04,708
What a cutie.

599
00:46:11,750 --> 00:46:14,250
Son, do try this tea.

600
00:46:15,208 --> 00:46:17,041
It's been specially imported.

601
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:19,333
Thank you.

602
00:46:30,208 --> 00:46:31,625
What lovely weather.

603
00:46:32,875 --> 00:46:35,208
Yes, it is. It's very nice.

604
00:46:41,750 --> 00:46:43,375
Oh, Son.

605
00:46:45,041 --> 00:46:48,208
Chanel isn't eating that stuff.
She's on a diet.

606
00:46:50,666 --> 00:46:53,125
Well, they are teenagers.

607
00:46:53,208 --> 00:46:54,541
Such high metabolisms.

608
00:46:55,541 --> 00:46:57,291
They can eat pretty much anything.

609
00:47:02,541 --> 00:47:03,666
Right.

610
00:47:03,750 --> 00:47:05,500
Of course.

611
00:47:11,916 --> 00:47:12,958
I see…

612
00:47:13,916 --> 00:47:15,916
someone's lost in thought today.

613
00:47:21,250 --> 00:47:22,625
It's just that, um…

614
00:47:23,833 --> 00:47:26,458
I guess it's just that
I'm not used to having you in the house.

615
00:47:27,666 --> 00:47:30,000
But I like it very much.

616
00:47:33,291 --> 00:47:34,166
Then…

617
00:47:37,291 --> 00:47:38,958
how about I come and live here?

618
00:47:42,666 --> 00:47:44,958
Excellent.

619
00:47:48,250 --> 00:47:50,958
Would you look at that? Our queen bee.

620
00:47:51,041 --> 00:47:53,875
You know, she just gave a lesson
on turning on the charm.

621
00:47:53,958 --> 00:47:56,375
Oh, and Son's doing well.

622
00:47:56,458 --> 00:47:58,541
He used to be such an Ice Prince,

623
00:47:58,625 --> 00:48:01,666
but now he's like a delicious snow cone.

624
00:48:01,750 --> 00:48:03,791
It's very moving to see.

625
00:48:03,875 --> 00:48:05,458
Can someone get me a water?

626
00:48:09,583 --> 00:48:10,583
How's it going?

627
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:17,833
<i>And Chanel's parents</i>
<i>seem very impressed with Son too.</i>

628
00:48:17,916 --> 00:48:21,708
<i>The most popular of The Gentlemen</i>
<i>with the heiress of Eve Capital.</i>

629
00:48:21,791 --> 00:48:23,666
<i>It's a match made in heaven.</i>

630
00:48:23,750 --> 00:48:26,083
Ugh! Son, you're a rotten cheat.

631
00:48:26,166 --> 00:48:28,041
Now I am switching my favorite.

632
00:48:28,708 --> 00:48:31,833
Oh, don't be like that.
Chanel and Son are so nice together.

633
00:48:32,416 --> 00:48:34,208
But Son's in love with Day.

634
00:48:34,708 --> 00:48:37,125
You just haven't seen
the way he looks at her.

635
00:48:37,208 --> 00:48:40,875
Oh, May, you say that
like you've seen him in person.

636
00:48:44,625 --> 00:48:46,041
Oh, look at that.

637
00:48:46,125 --> 00:48:47,708
Why don't you go open the door?

638
00:48:47,791 --> 00:48:50,583
It's obviously Son coming to visit.

639
00:48:50,666 --> 00:48:52,375
He really has been here, you know.

640
00:49:04,458 --> 00:49:07,083
<i>May I see</i>
<i>some childhood pictures of Chanel?</i>

641
00:49:07,625 --> 00:49:10,583
<i>Good idea. Please. </i>

642
00:49:13,708 --> 00:49:15,833
I really hope this plan comes together.

643
00:49:19,375 --> 00:49:21,291
After everything I've learned…

644
00:49:24,458 --> 00:49:25,750
I can't stay here.

645
00:49:34,166 --> 00:49:35,458
The kids on The Farm,

646
00:49:36,625 --> 00:49:38,625
do they ever meet their real mothers?

647
00:49:40,791 --> 00:49:42,208
We were raised on The Farm.

648
00:49:42,833 --> 00:49:45,208
We've had no contact with the outside.

649
00:49:45,708 --> 00:49:48,416
We never even knew
our biological families.

650
00:49:50,291 --> 00:49:53,708
Some mothers chose to give away
their children to The Farm.

651
00:49:54,666 --> 00:49:58,583
Then there's people like Max,
who were born into The Family.

652
00:50:01,833 --> 00:50:05,041
Don't you feel like maybe that's weird?

653
00:50:06,833 --> 00:50:08,750
What isn't weird these days?

654
00:50:10,791 --> 00:50:13,083
People are just trying to survive.

655
00:50:14,708 --> 00:50:16,125
I can understand that.

656
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:25,083
But not everyone… agrees.

657
00:50:36,166 --> 00:50:38,416
I've been here
many times in the past,

658
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:43,166
and I'd like to apologize
for, um, for the way I acted.

659
00:50:43,750 --> 00:50:47,541
It's just I never quite got
how things work,

660
00:50:47,625 --> 00:50:51,958
but I understand better now why I am here.

661
00:50:54,833 --> 00:50:56,541
I'm glad you're able to see that.

662
00:50:58,291 --> 00:51:02,250
Eve Capital always must have the best,

663
00:51:02,333 --> 00:51:04,083
and I can assure you, Son,

664
00:51:04,166 --> 00:51:07,458
you'll be a treasured addition
to our family, dear.

665
00:51:09,583 --> 00:51:11,708
<i>Thank you, Mrs. Kwan.</i>

666
00:51:12,458 --> 00:51:14,750
<i>But I have to confess that now…</i>

667
00:51:15,791 --> 00:51:19,250
I'm worried because I want Chal to…

668
00:51:20,541 --> 00:51:23,208
win the competition, or…

669
00:51:25,291 --> 00:51:26,708
we won't get to be together.

670
00:51:30,708 --> 00:51:33,541
We are the main sponsor of the show.

671
00:51:33,625 --> 00:51:35,541
I need Chanel to win.

672
00:51:36,041 --> 00:51:38,541
I will do whatever it takes.

673
00:51:41,750 --> 00:51:42,625
<i>Don't worry.</i>

674
00:51:42,708 --> 00:51:45,250
<i>It's all been arranged.</i>

675
00:51:53,083 --> 00:51:54,833
I'm so happy to hear that.

676
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,416
Your words mean a lot.

677
00:52:02,250 --> 00:52:03,250
It's so great!

678
00:52:07,250 --> 00:52:09,166
That's more than enough.

679
00:52:09,750 --> 00:52:12,250
Once this information is public knowledge,

680
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,125
it's over.

681
00:52:16,041 --> 00:52:17,541
I'm sorry, Chanel.

682
00:52:18,041 --> 00:52:21,583
Never again
will I judge someone so quickly.

683
00:52:26,375 --> 00:52:29,000
Ms. Kwan, you have a call from Ms. Jenny.

684
00:52:30,291 --> 00:52:31,208
Jenny.

685
00:52:33,083 --> 00:52:34,625
Excuse me for a moment.

686
00:52:34,708 --> 00:52:36,666
While you're gone,
I'll look at photographs.

687
00:52:37,333 --> 00:52:39,000
What a good idea.

688
00:52:42,666 --> 00:52:43,500
Hello?

689
00:52:44,541 --> 00:52:45,541
What is it?

690
00:52:48,583 --> 00:52:49,833
Files converted.

691
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:52,458
-Let's upload.
-Yay!

692
00:52:53,541 --> 00:52:55,208
-And enter.
-Yeah.

693
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,375
Huh? Oh no.

694
00:53:03,291 --> 00:53:04,833
Come on, internet.

695
00:53:04,916 --> 00:53:06,791
Is there no signal?

696
00:53:08,416 --> 00:53:10,666
Hang on. I'll try hotspotting you.

697
00:53:12,208 --> 00:53:13,458
-Hm?
-No.

698
00:53:13,541 --> 00:53:14,375
What?

699
00:53:16,458 --> 00:53:17,458
What?

700
00:53:18,125 --> 00:53:19,750
Mine doesn't have signal either.

701
00:53:20,541 --> 00:53:21,958
-What's happening?
-I'll check again.

702
00:53:23,250 --> 00:53:25,166
-It's not working.
-What's going on?

703
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,125
You're coming with us.

704
00:53:57,250 --> 00:54:00,833
You maintain a quiet and bored facade,

705
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:03,666
and yet, you're quite something,
aren't you?

706
00:54:34,750 --> 00:54:38,916
You should all be grateful
that I'm the one who found you out.

707
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,916
Otherwise, it would have been bad.

708
00:54:43,958 --> 00:54:47,375
But, as I'm the producer
of <i>Ready, Set, Love,</i>

709
00:54:47,458 --> 00:54:48,791
you're all my problem.

710
00:54:50,125 --> 00:54:53,791
So then, I've decided
to offer you a way out.

711
00:54:56,291 --> 00:54:59,541
If you all agree
to play the game as I instruct,

712
00:54:59,625 --> 00:55:00,916
and I mean you all,

713
00:55:02,291 --> 00:55:03,666
this will go no further.

714
00:55:04,458 --> 00:55:05,291
Okay?

715
00:55:06,083 --> 00:55:06,958
Win-win.

716
00:55:20,208 --> 00:55:23,833
You don't know how unpleasant
The Farm can get.

717
00:55:23,916 --> 00:55:25,625
Or Eve Capital's power.

718
00:55:27,208 --> 00:55:30,250
There are secrets in this place
that you'll never know.

719
00:55:30,916 --> 00:55:32,541
And you should leave them alone.

720
00:55:34,958 --> 00:55:36,250
So you're saying

721
00:55:37,625 --> 00:55:39,375
you knew about all of this?

722
00:55:42,958 --> 00:55:45,375
You're just a kid, and so you're naive.

723
00:55:46,833 --> 00:55:50,708
You couldn't possibly think
that if you just play the game,

724
00:55:50,791 --> 00:55:52,750
you'd get everything you want.

725
00:55:53,333 --> 00:55:56,500
You knew all of this, and ignored it.

726
00:55:57,125 --> 00:55:58,541
I know you have a heart,

727
00:55:59,333 --> 00:56:02,625
but I suppose it's okay
as long as it's someone else's child.

728
00:56:03,291 --> 00:56:04,625
Someone else's life, right?

729
00:56:04,708 --> 00:56:06,583
Who do you think you are?

730
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:12,375
Did you all really think that you
are the first to discover these things?

731
00:56:13,875 --> 00:56:17,291
To think that you'll change it?
The world won't be that easy on you.

732
00:56:19,916 --> 00:56:21,166
And you.

733
00:56:22,666 --> 00:56:24,375
You just won't give up.

734
00:56:24,458 --> 00:56:28,000
Why would you do it again,
after I told you what would happen?

735
00:56:29,166 --> 00:56:31,666
Did you really think
I wouldn't keep an eye on you?

736
00:56:31,750 --> 00:56:34,750
What kind of stupid idiot
do you think you're dealing with?

737
00:56:35,875 --> 00:56:37,750
You brought all of this on yourself.

738
00:56:37,833 --> 00:56:39,250
You and City Ground.

739
00:56:40,666 --> 00:56:44,166
You just said you'd let us go
if we played the game your way.

740
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:46,333
Yeah.

741
00:56:46,916 --> 00:56:50,291
The thing is, pumpkins,
she's not on the show.

742
00:56:50,375 --> 00:56:52,541
She's not special, like you are.

743
00:57:25,166 --> 00:57:27,291
Please, will you tell me
where we're going?

744
00:57:28,416 --> 00:57:29,500
Excuse me.

745
00:57:30,750 --> 00:57:31,750
Excuse me?

746
00:57:32,791 --> 00:57:35,458
Please? Please?

747
00:57:36,625 --> 00:57:38,083
Where are you taking me?

748
00:57:40,541 --> 00:57:41,708
Please.

749
00:57:54,083 --> 00:57:55,166
Why is it like this?

750
00:57:56,750 --> 00:57:59,375
We only want what everybody else has.

751
00:58:01,875 --> 00:58:03,625
Why can't we be free?

752
00:58:16,291 --> 00:58:17,375
It's all right.

753
00:58:19,958 --> 00:58:21,250
Don't cry, Paper.

754
00:58:34,541 --> 00:58:35,541
It's for you.

755
00:58:47,625 --> 00:58:48,583
Come along now.

756
00:58:52,208 --> 00:58:54,500
How come the lady looks so sad?

757
00:59:00,166 --> 00:59:03,416
But I suppose it's okay
as long as it's someone else's child,

758
00:59:04,250 --> 00:59:05,625
someone else's life.

759
00:59:17,708 --> 00:59:18,875
She was right.

760
00:59:20,416 --> 00:59:22,000
I am just a naive kid.

761
00:59:26,833 --> 00:59:28,625
Who am I to change anything?

762
00:59:31,125 --> 00:59:32,208
You're amazing.

763
00:59:35,375 --> 00:59:36,625
Don't worry.

764
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:40,333
We're not out of hope yet, you know.

765
01:00:24,666 --> 01:00:27,541
So we stick to the plan, but in secret?

766
01:00:27,625 --> 01:00:28,625
Exactly.

767
01:00:29,625 --> 01:00:30,958
Just like the competition.

768
01:00:32,750 --> 01:00:33,875
It's here.

769
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:38,958
Only this time, it's real.

770
01:00:43,333 --> 01:00:44,458
We need to work out…

771
01:00:45,875 --> 01:00:48,333
who the Invisible Witches are among us.

772
01:01:24,416 --> 01:01:25,416
It's here.

773
01:01:27,250 --> 01:01:28,250
My God.

774
01:01:50,250 --> 01:01:51,875
Hey! What are you doing?

775
01:01:53,333 --> 01:01:55,708
Requesting back-up.
We have an intruder.
