1
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,708
I'm pleased to welcome you Ladies
to your new home, The Farm.

2
00:00:10,416 --> 00:00:14,208
The history of The Farm
begins with the pandemic of the 1970s

3
00:00:14,291 --> 00:00:18,958
which infected only men
and decimated the global male population.

4
00:00:19,583 --> 00:00:24,166
Worse than that, male birth rates
plummeted in the years that followed.

5
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:26,708
And though we've managed
to increase birth rates

6
00:00:26,791 --> 00:00:30,208
through artificial methods
like in vitro fertilization,

7
00:00:30,291 --> 00:00:35,041
females make up 99.99%
of all new babies.

8
00:00:35,125 --> 00:00:38,791
This means that
men are an invaluable resource.

9
00:00:39,541 --> 00:00:44,750
So the government passed legislation
requiring all men to live on The Farm.

10
00:00:45,791 --> 00:00:49,208
Here they can live comfortably and safely

11
00:00:49,833 --> 00:00:51,666
under government supervision.

12
00:00:53,708 --> 00:00:56,791
Chal, we're really on The Farm.

13
00:01:01,833 --> 00:01:04,708
Oh, look out, land of men.

14
00:01:05,375 --> 00:01:07,500
Bovy has arrived!

15
00:01:14,125 --> 00:01:15,750
-Get past it.
-Yeah, I got it.

16
00:01:15,833 --> 00:01:17,000
Goal!

17
00:01:18,625 --> 00:01:19,541

34
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:42,791
-You sure?
-Hm.

35
00:02:43,791 --> 00:02:44,791
Yeah.

36
00:02:48,541 --> 00:02:51,041
-Ready, Lotto Girl?
-Yeah!

37
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:52,791
One, two, three.

38
00:02:52,875 --> 00:02:56,291
Go, Day, you can do it.
Yes, you can. Okay!

39
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:59,750
Lotto Girl, Lotto Girl, Lotto Girl!
Go, Day!

40
00:03:08,458 --> 00:03:12,208
And don't forget to get some rest.
Now her condition has improved

41
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:14,291
but she still needs close attention.

42
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:18,458
Hello and good luck!

43
00:03:18,541 --> 00:03:20,250
You heard the nurse.
Get some rest.

44
00:03:24,958 --> 00:03:27,958
Uh, I'll go and get something to eat.

45
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:31,291
I'll be back later.

46
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:37,125
I've been so worried.

47
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:41,958
Day, come on now.
Your sister's as tough as nails.

48
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:43,416
Mm, yeah.

49
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:47,708
My sister got on a national TV show.

50
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:50,000
How am I supposed to just lie here?

51
00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:53,916
Oh, yeah.
Can I see my autograph from Son?

52
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:58,291
The autograph…

53
00:03:59,791 --> 00:04:00,916
Mm!

54
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:07,333
I see.

55
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:11,875
It looks like you might be in love.

56
00:04:11,958 --> 00:04:14,333
No, May. You must be crazy
if you think that.

57
00:04:14,416 --> 00:04:16,458
I bet you're in love.
I bet you're in love.

58
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:17,875
She's infatuated.

59
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:21,416
Va! That's not true, okay? I'm serious.

60
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:25,000
You have the energy to tease me?
You must be recovered.

61
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:25,916
You're in love!

62
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:28,208
I am not, okay?

63
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:29,375
Just a little bit.

64
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:32,416
No, I don't even like him.

65
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,500
What did you find out?

66
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,291
From the show's scripts I checked,

67
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:00,916
nothing in them seems strange.

68
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:07,875
I knew this wouldn't be
as easy as I thought.

69
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:12,208
In all the many seasons of this show,

70
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:15,875
the winners have only ever been
from the elite families.

71
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:19,208
You'd think there would be evidence
of fixed results,

72
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:21,208
and yet we can't find it.

73
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:25,208
After the auditions,

74
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:28,208
some of the staff get to film at The Farm.

75
00:05:29,666 --> 00:05:31,875
Hopefully then, I'll find something.

76
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:37,375
Please just tell the others
not to worry about me.

77
00:05:40,958 --> 00:05:43,625
The others aren't as worried about you
as I am.

78
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:52,458
Mom, don't worry, okay?

79
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:55,208
I'll take good care of myself.

80
00:05:55,291 --> 00:05:56,458
Yeah, and…

81
00:05:58,125 --> 00:06:01,375
I promised you that I would
and I'll find him soon.

82
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:03,458
Thank you, sweetheart.

83
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:36,500
Son,

84
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:39,041
you seem to have lost weight lately.

85
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:41,416
Please do eat.

86
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:58,791
I'll try.

87
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:01,000
Good.

88
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,958
Chanel, have some more to eat.

89
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:11,500
You could use the energy.

90
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:16,000
Have some more pork, honey.

91
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:18,750
Thank you, Dad.

92
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:19,666
Dear.

93
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,833
Chanel has to watch her figure.

94
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:24,125
Why would you give her something fatty?

95
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:27,125
You're right.

96
00:07:27,791 --> 00:07:29,000
Maybe you shouldn't.

97
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:32,333
Here, I'll take that.

98
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:34,416
Have more vegetables instead.

99
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:39,125
Thank you, Dad.

100
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:45,500
Ms. Kwan, Ms. Jenny is here.

101
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:50,583
Chanel, Son.

102
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:52,875
I have business to attend to.

103
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:55,041
Will you both excuse me?

104
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:57,375
Okay.

105
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:16,958
What do you think?

106
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:20,291
About the competition. Are you excited?

107
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:21,958
Excited?

108
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:27,375
You don't think <i>Ready, Set, Love</i>
will be exciting?

109
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:30,500
What's there to be excited about?

110
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:32,625
It's a fixed competition.

111
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:02,875
Our first episode rated higher
than any previous season.

112
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:11,916
You're too kind.

113
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:14,000
It's just that I've quit.

114
00:09:20,541 --> 00:09:22,375
Congratulations on the show.

115
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:25,041
But I am worried.

116
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:29,125
About the plan
for Son and my daughter.

117
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:32,916
Is it still going to plan?

118
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:35,291
Yes.

119
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,541
What about that Lotto Girl?

120
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:51,333
Will she become a problem?

121
00:09:58,708 --> 00:10:01,375
Rest assured
she's only there to boost ratings.

122
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:07,583
That's all right then.

123
00:10:08,291 --> 00:10:09,875
I'm sure you have it handled.

124
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,291
I do indeed.

125
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:14,416
Thank you for your time.

126
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:21,125
You've always worn heels.

127
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:30,250
But lately you're in flats when I see you.

128
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:34,041
And you've given up drinking.

129
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:44,125
I'm trying to take care of my health.

130
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:47,208
Have a good day.

131
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:56,500
The case at the clinic, right?

132
00:10:57,666 --> 00:10:59,875
Yes, I'll check in the morning.

133
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:01,500
Bye.

134
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:13,583
Whoa, babe, what is it? Everything okay?

135
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:17,750
It's that woman.
Always in everyone's business.

136
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,666
I understand
she's used to being in charge.

137
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:23,791
But she just can't stick her nose
into everyone's lives.

138
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:28,750
No. Poor babe. Are you hungry? Is that it?
Would you like some food?

139
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:30,500
Good idea.

140
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:35,208
What's all this stuff, babe?
Don't you think you might be overdoing it?

141
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:37,375
It's not really a lot.

142
00:11:39,791 --> 00:11:43,708
Besides, a first-time mom
is a special thing, isn't it?

143
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:45,583
So I'm excited.

144
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:49,250
Hey, your shoot.
Doesn't it start tomorrow?

145
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:53,416
I know how hard you worked for this, babe,
and I know you're great at it,

146
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:58,041
but you also need to take it easy.

147
00:11:58,125 --> 00:12:00,041
Okay!

148
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:02,125
-Let's go then.
-Now let's get something to eat.

149
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:03,125
Okay.

150
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:05,708
Yeah! Let's go. I'm starving.

151
00:12:12,416 --> 00:12:15,916
<i>Hello, ladies.</i>

Board games.

157
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:47,875
I wonder if they mean Monopoly,
rolling dice games,

158
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:50,458
or something like Hungry Hippos.

159
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,708
It won't be Hungry Hippos.

I need help over here.

I'm Bovy. Hi.

179
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:41,791
Oh, oh, Max. Hey. Hey.

180
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:48,666
My arms are small and I can't exactly,
you know, lift much without hurting it.

181
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:50,208
Come on, Max.

182
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:52,625
Will you help me with my bags?

183
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:55,041
Yeah.

184
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:21,208
He's playing hard to get.

185
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:25,791
I'll take your luggage for you.

186
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:28,291
-Oh, yeah, about the last round--
-Your luggage.

187
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:33,916
Okay, thanks.

188
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:39,250
Uh…

189
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:40,375
Whats the matter?

190
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:41,458
Is it heavy?

191
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:46,166
It's fine.

192
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:47,833
Fine.

193
00:16:12,583 --> 00:16:13,666
Oh!

194
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:15,916
Whoa!

195
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,541
Who put my luggage here?!

196
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:39,541
Son. You okay?

197
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:41,666
I don't get it.

198
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,750
I've got this sharp pain right here.

199
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:46,125
-Right here.
-Ah!

200
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:54,250
Hello, Day. Why are you calling me?
You told me you'd be filming all day.

201
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:57,250
May, I've got some time
while there's a lunch break and look.

202
00:16:58,083 --> 00:17:01,916
Behold. My place! Whoo!

203
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,333
Look at the view, May.

204
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:06,750
Oh, I'm jelly.

205
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:10,625
Oh…

206
00:17:11,708 --> 00:17:17,000
My God. The bed, it's so soft, May.

207
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:19,750
So much better than the one at home.

208
00:17:20,708 --> 00:17:23,541
It's not as good as my bed.
This one's got a button.

209
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:26,333
Watch this.
I press it and a nurse appears.

210
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:30,666
I can call the nurses whenever I like.

211
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:35,541
<i>All contestants,</i>
<i>please report for lunch.</i>

212
00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:41,958
Well, I better get going.

213
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:44,750
May, I'll call you back
when I have time, okay?

214
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:46,791
<i>Get well soon.</i>

215
00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:49,708
Bye-bye.

216
00:17:53,916 --> 00:17:57,000
Okay, okay, don't worry.
I know you're starving.

217
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:07,083
-What?
-Huh?

218
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:08,666
-Huh?
-Why are they empty?

219
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:10,291
There's nothing here!

220
00:18:10,375 --> 00:18:11,708
And I'm hungry.

221
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:13,416
<i>Hello, everyone.</i>

222
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:21,166
<i>It's time for</i>
<i>the first challenge of Ready, Set, Love.</i>

223
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:22,416
Jeez.

224
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,083
<i>Do you know this saying?</i>

225
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:28,083
<i>"The way to a man's heart</i>
<i>is through his stomach."</i>

226
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:32,416
<i>Our first challenge</i>
<i>is a cooking competition.</i>

227
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,333
Why?

228
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:35,041
Wow.

229
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:47,041
<i>Check your smartwatch now</i>
<i>to find out which team you're on.</i>

230
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:14,416
-Are you ready?
-Yes, ma'am.

231
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,416
Yes, ma'am.

232
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:18,625
Begin.

233
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:20,833
-Five.
-Four.

234
00:19:20,916 --> 00:19:22,083
Three.

235
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:23,083
Two.

236
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:24,166
One.

237
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:29,791
<i>Hello and welcome back, everyone,</i>
<i>to </i>Ready, Set, Love.

238
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:33,125
<i>After the audition round,</i>
<i>we are down to just 20 ladies.</i>

239
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:36,208
What happened to everyone?
Here's who's still in the game.

240
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:38,166
Any teams
we should be watching out for?

241
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:42,083
For this challenge, I'm keeping my eye
on one team with a clear advantage,

242
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:43,458
<i>and that's Almond's team.</i>

243
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:47,833
<i>Team Almond is,</i>
<i>of course, led by Almond,</i>

244
00:19:47,916 --> 00:19:50,375
<i>whose hobby is cooking. </i>

245
00:19:50,458 --> 00:19:53,666
<i>We also have Kaew, a qualified chef.</i>

246
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:55,250
<i>Ooh!</i>

247
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:59,000
<i>Khaopoon,</i>
<i>heiress to the famous food franchise.</i>

248
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:00,000
<i>Wow!</i>

249
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:02,000
<i>And then we have Mako,</i>

250
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:05,625
<i>a popular foodie, influencer</i>
<i>and content creator.</i>

251
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:10,041
And between those four,
they have this wrapped up.

252
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:13,833
Lotto Girl, you got this.
It's lucky she got a good team this round.

253
00:20:13,916 --> 00:20:16,833
If she doesn't get in the way,
it'll be their game.

254
00:20:21,416 --> 00:20:25,750
<i>As mentioned, the theme</i>
<i>of this year's challenges is board games.</i>

255
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:29,958
<i>However, this is no ordinary board game.</i>

256
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:33,166
<i>It's a giant board game.</i>

257
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:38,250
<i>The name of the game is Cooking Run,</i>

258
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:40,583
<i>The Hot-headed Kitchen.</i>

259
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:43,208
Wow!

260
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:44,458
Wow, I love these gloves.

261
00:20:44,541 --> 00:20:50,333
<i>The aim of the game is to serve</i>
<i>the designated dishes in the given time.</i>

262
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:53,458
<i>Each dish will appear onscreen.</i>

263
00:20:56,708 --> 00:20:59,291
<i>The Gentlemen must run to the fridge</i>

264
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:02,125
<i>to find an ingredient for the dish.</i>

265
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:06,375
<i>They must then pass that ingredient</i>
<i>to a team member</i>

266
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:10,333
<i>who will pass it to the next person</i>
<i>and so on.</i>

267
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:14,583
<i>The last person brings the ingredient</i>
<i>to the serving plate.</i>

268
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:19,375
<i>When the time runs out,</i>
<i>the camera on top will take a picture.</i>

269
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:22,250
<i>Contestants must be positioned</i>
<i>in the serving plate</i>

270
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:24,416
<i>and must smile for the camera</i>

271
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,791
<i>The contestant's face must be visible</i>
<i>to receive points.</i>

272
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:30,708
<i>Points vary for each dish.</i>

273
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:33,166
This doesn't resemble cooking in any way.

274
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:38,416
<i>The losing team will be disqualified</i>
<i>and will not be offered any food.</i>

275
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,416
What the F?

276
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,541
Who's going to win today?

277
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:46,000
The person that I'm going to be
keeping my eye on in this round

278
00:21:46,083 --> 00:21:49,375
is gonna be the most fit one
and that's Max, right?

279
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:52,041
<i>Oh, he's taking his shirt off again.</i>

280
00:21:52,125 --> 00:21:55,000
<i>Hmm.</i>

281
00:21:55,083 --> 00:21:57,541
If we're looking at Max's physique,

282
00:21:57,625 --> 00:22:01,083
we're going to say
Max is the most athletic of The Gentlemen.

283
00:22:01,166 --> 00:22:02,916
Oh, he's certainly fit.

284
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,833
And who's on Max's team?

285
00:22:04,916 --> 00:22:06,916
<i>It's Bovy. There she is.</i>

286
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:10,875
<i>Despite appearances,</i>
<i>Bovy goes to the gym regularly.</i>

287
00:22:11,375 --> 00:22:13,791
But if we're going to pick a winner,

288
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:17,041
we have to consider
The Ladies on each team.

289
00:22:17,708 --> 00:22:21,083
In which case, the team that sticks out
has to be Son's team.

290
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:25,916
<i>It's rare for Son</i>
<i>to show off a sporty side.</i>

291
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,166
<i>But he's actually</i>
<i>one of the most accomplished athletes</i>

292
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:30,666
<i>among The Gentlemen.</i>

293
00:22:31,791 --> 00:22:34,666
He's also got Venus on his team.

294
00:22:35,375 --> 00:22:37,500
<i>Venus is a champion sprinter.</i>

295
00:22:38,125 --> 00:22:42,083
And we shouldn't forget
that Orn is a pole dance instructor.

296
00:22:42,166 --> 00:22:45,166
<i>Wow. Check out that flexibility. Amazing.</i>

297
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:48,208
And he's also got
a secret weapon in Nina.

298
00:22:48,291 --> 00:22:51,833
<i>Nina is a fitness influencer.</i>
<i>Oh, wow! Watch her go.</i>

299
00:22:51,916 --> 00:22:54,500
<i>And, trust me,</i>
<i>that's harder than it looks.</i>

300
00:22:54,583 --> 00:22:59,041
And of course, we can't talk
about Son's team without Chanel.

301
00:22:59,125 --> 00:23:01,458
<i>We all know</i>
<i>Chanel is a strong all-rounder,</i>

302
00:23:01,541 --> 00:23:05,166
<i>but crucially, she was</i>
<i>a professional junior tennis player. Wow!</i>

303
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:11,250
<i>Contestants, on your marks.</i>

304
00:23:30,875 --> 00:23:33,208
FIND INGREDIENTS
CRISPY PORK WITH HOLY BASIL (5 PTS)

305
00:23:36,166 --> 00:23:37,958
Holy basil and crispy pork.

306
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:40,916
Holy basil and crispy pork.

307
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,041
Holy basil, hey, there's one. Hey!

308
00:23:44,125 --> 00:23:45,875
Hey, hey!

309
00:23:46,791 --> 00:23:48,333
Crispy pork.

310
00:23:48,416 --> 00:23:49,916
Come on!

311
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,083
Hey! There's no pork.

312
00:23:54,375 --> 00:23:56,791
Wait. I found another one!

313
00:24:05,333 --> 00:24:07,500
Come on. Finally!

314
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:13,000
You have to be fast, okay?
Come on, faster.

315
00:24:13,083 --> 00:24:15,250
Uh, it's not very aerodynamic.

316
00:24:15,333 --> 00:24:17,166
Come on! Hurry up, Day.

317
00:24:17,875 --> 00:24:19,458
Ha!

318
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,500
Is this really necessary?

319
00:24:47,125 --> 00:24:49,500
Yay! May, your sister is amazing.

320
00:24:49,583 --> 00:24:51,916
She did it despite everything. Yay!

321
00:24:54,833 --> 00:24:56,250
Hang on a sec.

322
00:25:03,625 --> 00:25:05,458
No. But…

323
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:09,833
What happened?
Almond's team didn't get a point.

324
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:13,166
Oh! Look at that.

325
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:18,750
I see what it is now.
That's sweet basil, not holy basil.

326
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:22,333
SWEET BASIL

327
00:25:22,416 --> 00:25:26,291
Uh, the basil isn't right? Ah!

328
00:25:29,083 --> 00:25:30,625
Almond who loves cooking

329
00:25:30,708 --> 00:25:33,958
can't tell the difference
between sweet and holy basil.

330
00:25:34,041 --> 00:25:36,000
<i>He only knows</i>
<i>how to cook Western food.</i>

331
00:25:36,083 --> 00:25:37,375
I understand.

332
00:25:37,458 --> 00:25:40,916
It's easy to miss those tiny details
in the heat of the moment.

333
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,250
We've all been there.

334
00:25:49,416 --> 00:25:50,708
Pass it down the line.

335
00:25:56,791 --> 00:25:59,875
She said if she doesn't get to eat,
then you're dead meat. Okay?

336
00:25:59,958 --> 00:26:01,375
She wants lunch.

337
00:26:12,916 --> 00:26:14,541
GRILLED CHICKEN / PAPAYA SALAD (10 PTS.)

338
00:26:16,166 --> 00:26:18,291
Chicken and papaya salad. Huh.

339
00:26:22,333 --> 00:26:24,625
It looks like
Almond is letting down the team.

340
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:28,375
Our Lotto Girl
will really struggle to catch up.

341
00:26:28,458 --> 00:26:30,083
Will your sister be okay?

342
00:26:30,166 --> 00:26:32,916
Believe me when I say,
you haven't seen anything yet.

343
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,208
My sister's serious about food.

344
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:38,625
Oh, gosh. I'd better run
or I won't make it.

345
00:26:40,583 --> 00:26:42,541
Oi! Get moving.

346
00:26:44,375 --> 00:26:46,000
I'm hungry!

347
00:26:52,125 --> 00:26:53,958
Al! Take that one.

348
00:26:55,083 --> 00:26:56,083
Grilled chicken.

349
00:26:58,583 --> 00:27:00,041
Why would you help me?

350
00:27:00,125 --> 00:27:03,125
Um, because we're brothers.
I gotta help you.

351
00:27:03,208 --> 00:27:04,375
Nice one.

352
00:27:07,541 --> 00:27:13,208
I'm hungry.

353
00:27:15,666 --> 00:27:19,291
Move!

354
00:27:21,458 --> 00:27:24,791
Whoa! Have you ever seen
grilled chicken move like that?

355
00:27:24,875 --> 00:27:27,250
<i>Could this be a comeback?</i>

356
00:27:49,291 --> 00:27:50,250
Yes!

357
00:27:50,833 --> 00:27:52,166
<i>Incredible.</i>

358
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:55,291
I never thought I'd see a chicken fly.

359
00:28:17,208 --> 00:28:19,625
<i>Our last dish is a special one.</i>

360
00:28:19,708 --> 00:28:23,875
We're going to be making
Seafood Tom Yum soup today.

361
00:28:23,958 --> 00:28:26,416
SEAFOOD TOM YUM
(15 PTS.)

362
00:28:27,416 --> 00:28:28,958
Seafood Tom Yum.

363
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:31,125
Squid.

364
00:28:31,708 --> 00:28:35,125
Squid, shrimp, crab. Squid, shrimp, crab.
Squid, shrimp, crab!

365
00:28:42,041 --> 00:28:44,500
Shrimp, shrimp. Hey, hey!

366
00:28:44,583 --> 00:28:46,416
-I thought you were allergic.
-What?

367
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,750
Crab, crab. Crab. Hey!

368
00:28:48,833 --> 00:28:50,750
-There's a squid over there.
-Squid.

369
00:28:51,541 --> 00:28:53,000
Hey, that one's mine!

370
00:28:53,083 --> 00:28:55,166
-No, please. No, please let me have it.
-Hey!

371
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:57,708
-No! I'm so screwed. Hey!
-Sucker!

372
00:28:57,791 --> 00:29:00,500
What else is there?
What else is there?

373
00:29:01,083 --> 00:29:03,708
Think, think, think.
Squid, shrimp, crab.

374
00:29:03,791 --> 00:29:06,125
What else am I missing?

375
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:10,041
If I don't get to eat lunch,
then you're dead.

376
00:29:13,625 --> 00:29:15,041
What do I do now?

377
00:29:15,875 --> 00:29:17,583
Mushrooms, okay?

378
00:29:17,666 --> 00:29:21,750
Mushroom. Hurry. You're standing on one.

379
00:29:22,833 --> 00:29:23,875
Mushroom?

380
00:29:24,708 --> 00:29:25,875
A mushroom!

381
00:29:25,958 --> 00:29:27,125
Uh… Uh…

382
00:29:31,208 --> 00:29:33,583
Go, go, go, go!

383
00:29:44,875 --> 00:29:45,791
Run!

384
00:29:55,166 --> 00:29:56,583
Run!

385
00:30:05,041 --> 00:30:06,083
-Eeny!
-Huh?

386
00:30:06,166 --> 00:30:07,333
-Meeny!
-Huh?

387
00:30:07,416 --> 00:30:09,166
-Miny! Moe!
-Huh? Wha…

388
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:11,208
Huh? Uh, what's next?

389
00:30:11,291 --> 00:30:12,583
Ha!

390
00:30:12,666 --> 00:30:14,416
Eeny, meeny…

391
00:30:15,291 --> 00:30:17,166
Move!

392
00:30:29,708 --> 00:30:31,916
What did I say?

393
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:43,250
That was unexpected.
That puts Team Almond in first place.

394
00:30:43,333 --> 00:30:44,625
Beating Son's team.

395
00:30:46,666 --> 00:30:51,416
<i>And we can no longer say</i>
<i>our Lotto Girl is getting by on luck.</i>

396
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:56,000
In this competition, huh,
she's carrying the whole team on her back.

397
00:30:57,166 --> 00:31:00,500
<i>And the team</i>
<i>with the lowest score is…</i>

398
00:31:01,416 --> 00:31:02,333
<i>Team Jin.</i>

399
00:31:03,041 --> 00:31:05,208
<i>Oh, what a shame</i>.

400
00:31:05,291 --> 00:31:08,125
<i>Jin's team has been eliminated.</i>

401
00:31:08,208 --> 00:31:10,041
It's okay. It's okay. Yeah.

402
00:31:10,125 --> 00:31:14,125
<i>And now the members of Jin's team</i>
<i>must leave the competition.</i>

403
00:31:14,833 --> 00:31:17,000
<i>What a tragedy for Jin.</i>

404
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:18,083
Bye.

405
00:31:22,208 --> 00:31:26,500
<i>Only 15 Ladies</i>
<i>can go through to the next round.</i>

406
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:32,125
<i>Therefore, we are eliminating</i>
<i>The Lady with the lowest audience vote.</i>

407
00:31:33,541 --> 00:31:35,333
<i>It's time to go home…</i>

408
00:31:37,583 --> 00:31:38,791
<i>Pangwan.</i>

409
00:31:40,208 --> 00:31:45,000
<i>The scores from this round</i>
<i>will be combined with audience votes.</i>

410
00:31:45,083 --> 00:31:50,583
<i>The top five Ladies win a date</i>
<i>with The Gentleman of their choice.</i>

411
00:31:50,666 --> 00:31:53,500
<i>The results will be announced shortly.</i>

412
00:31:53,583 --> 00:31:54,958
Looking at the current scores,

413
00:31:55,041 --> 00:32:01,583
I'm going to say I am very certain
that the popular favorite will be Chanel.

414
00:32:01,666 --> 00:32:02,875
No doubt about that.

415
00:32:02,958 --> 00:32:06,000
When we see who has the most followers
on social media,

416
00:32:06,083 --> 00:32:08,916
it's clear that Chanel has a sizable lead.

417
00:32:10,083 --> 00:32:11,333
Ooh!

418
00:32:11,416 --> 00:32:13,375
Well, based on the data,

419
00:32:13,458 --> 00:32:15,166
the result looks pretty clear.

420
00:32:15,958 --> 00:32:18,000
<i>We have calculated the scores.</i>

421
00:32:18,083 --> 00:32:21,291
<i>The first contestant</i>
<i>to choose their date will be…</i>

422
00:32:28,625 --> 00:32:29,500
<i>Day.</i>

423
00:32:30,583 --> 00:32:31,416
Hm?

424
00:32:33,375 --> 00:32:34,708
Uh… Uh…

425
00:32:35,666 --> 00:32:36,791
What's going on?

426
00:32:39,125 --> 00:32:41,125
If there's one thing we do know,

427
00:32:41,208 --> 00:32:45,750
it's to do the opposite of what he says.

428
00:32:45,833 --> 00:32:48,041
Oh.

429
00:32:48,125 --> 00:32:50,500
Uh, well, despite the predictions,

430
00:32:50,583 --> 00:32:54,000
the popular vote did not go to Chanel.

431
00:32:54,083 --> 00:32:55,500
Yes.

432
00:32:57,625 --> 00:32:58,625
What's going on?

433
00:32:59,416 --> 00:33:01,541
Did I win this?

434
00:33:04,125 --> 00:33:07,250
<i>Day, please step forward</i>
<i>and choose your date.</i>

435
00:33:08,375 --> 00:33:10,083
<i>Who do you think she'll pick?</i>

436
00:33:10,166 --> 00:33:13,166
From my analysis, I have to say…

437
00:33:15,208 --> 00:33:18,583
Probably best to wait
and see what happens.

438
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:26,083
If you had to pick one of them for a date,
which one do you think you'd like?

439
00:33:27,083 --> 00:33:28,333
Pick one?

440
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:32,041
How would I even know which one to pick?

441
00:33:32,125 --> 00:33:34,083
I don't know what they're like.

442
00:33:34,666 --> 00:33:37,041
If you can't think of any who you like…

443
00:33:38,208 --> 00:33:40,250
I'd choose someone I think likes me.

444
00:34:06,666 --> 00:34:09,166
Might we go on a date?

445
00:34:10,416 --> 00:34:14,541
Is there, maybe,
one of them who assisted somehow?

446
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:29,666
<i>Oh! Look at that.</i>

447
00:34:30,291 --> 00:34:33,958
<i>Who knew that even an iceberg like Son</i>
<i>could melt.</i>

448
00:34:34,041 --> 00:34:36,791
Oh, they're making me cry.

449
00:34:36,875 --> 00:34:38,291
Hm.

450
00:34:38,375 --> 00:34:41,333
In the last round, Son chose to save Day.

451
00:34:41,416 --> 00:34:43,750
And now she's chosen a date with him.

452
00:34:43,833 --> 00:34:48,041
I'm telling you, these two
are going to end up together.

453
00:35:01,958 --> 00:35:04,458
The views and comments
are soaring, boss.

454
00:35:08,125 --> 00:35:09,125
How's it going?

455
00:35:10,708 --> 00:35:12,000
Yeah, it's awesome.

456
00:35:12,083 --> 00:35:13,125
Oh, gosh.

457
00:35:15,583 --> 00:35:16,583
THIS IS SO NICE.

458
00:35:16,666 --> 00:35:18,000
I'M NOT JEALOUS… HMPH!

459
00:35:18,083 --> 00:35:19,416
GO FOR IT, LOTTO GIRL!

460
00:35:21,125 --> 00:35:22,833
MRS. KWAN

461
00:35:30,208 --> 00:35:31,125
Yes.

462
00:35:35,458 --> 00:35:36,416
Yes.

463
00:35:38,333 --> 00:35:39,458
I'm working on it.

464
00:35:41,625 --> 00:35:43,291
Everything will still go to plan.

465
00:35:44,708 --> 00:35:45,833
I'm fixing it now.

466
00:35:48,625 --> 00:35:49,708
I understand.

467
00:36:10,333 --> 00:36:13,083
Now we know who each of the couples are,

468
00:36:13,166 --> 00:36:16,958
I'm dying to find out
where they'll be going on their date.

469
00:36:17,041 --> 00:36:19,291
That's right. But more importantly,

470
00:36:19,375 --> 00:36:23,625
I want to know what our contestants
will be wearing tonight.

471
00:36:23,708 --> 00:36:26,916
First impressions really matter here.

472
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,708
I can't wait to see them dressed to kill.

473
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:32,208
It's gonna be fire.

474
00:36:32,916 --> 00:36:34,250
They're going to slay.

475
00:36:35,208 --> 00:36:37,375
They're going to knock 'em dead.

476
00:37:06,125 --> 00:37:06,958
What are you doing?

477
00:37:07,916 --> 00:37:08,958
Why are you in here?

478
00:37:11,291 --> 00:37:12,916
I just forgot something.

479
00:37:15,208 --> 00:37:16,875
I came back for it.

480
00:37:48,875 --> 00:37:52,583
<i>Tonight will be</i>
<i>the first official dates of the season.</i>

481
00:37:53,375 --> 00:37:56,750
<i>So hopefully our contestants can relax</i>
<i>and be themselves</i>

482
00:37:56,833 --> 00:38:00,500
<i>and take the opportunity</i>
<i>to get to know the other person.</i>

483
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,666
Weather's nice, huh, Paper?

484
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:06,458
-I like your suit.
-Oh, thanks.

485
00:38:06,541 --> 00:38:07,583
Is it tailored?

486
00:38:07,666 --> 00:38:09,875
-Your pre-dinner drinks, gentlemen.
-Great, thanks.

487
00:38:09,958 --> 00:38:11,125
Thanks.

488
00:38:11,625 --> 00:38:12,791
Look at that.

489
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:15,000
-It is a nice suit.
-Yeah.

490
00:38:16,541 --> 00:38:17,583
Gentlemen.

491
00:38:17,666 --> 00:38:19,125
Sure, I'll take a drink.

492
00:38:20,375 --> 00:38:21,916
Mm, that's good.

493
00:38:56,833 --> 00:38:58,041
Are you hot?

494
00:38:59,125 --> 00:39:00,458
Oh-- Oh.

495
00:39:01,083 --> 00:39:02,500
Oh, my gosh.

496
00:39:06,166 --> 00:39:07,500
Tissue paper is better.

497
00:39:08,083 --> 00:39:12,291
If you use blotting paper,
your makeup will come off on it.

498
00:39:13,916 --> 00:39:14,750
Oh.

499
00:39:15,583 --> 00:39:17,250
If you can't believe a makeup model,

500
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,208
who can you believe?

501
00:39:23,666 --> 00:39:24,791
You don't want it.

502
00:39:29,291 --> 00:39:30,333
What luck.

503
00:39:33,166 --> 00:39:35,333
So where is your necklace?

504
00:39:38,291 --> 00:39:42,041
Oh, I put it away.
It doesn't go with my dress.

505
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:45,375
Besides, it's not important.

506
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,750
Mr. Son and Mr. Almond,
your tables are ready.

507
00:39:52,833 --> 00:39:54,750
Thank you. After you, Kaew.

508
00:39:54,833 --> 00:39:56,416
Mr. Jin, Mr. Max, your tables are ready.

509
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:57,333
Hello, Day.

510
00:40:05,333 --> 00:40:06,500
Here you are, sir.

511
00:40:07,958 --> 00:40:09,458
And for you, miss.

512
00:40:23,041 --> 00:40:24,416
Feel free to dig in.

513
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,250
Have a seat.

514
00:40:54,791 --> 00:40:56,875
Hm. Classic.

515
00:40:58,583 --> 00:40:59,875
What do you mean?

516
00:41:02,833 --> 00:41:04,500
I wouldn't have guessed
you like that music.

517
00:41:04,583 --> 00:41:06,583
I also listen to death metal.

518
00:41:08,458 --> 00:41:09,291
Metal.

519
00:41:13,041 --> 00:41:15,291
Quiet, keep your voice down. Shh.

520
00:41:16,416 --> 00:41:18,833
I heard you like to listen
to all kinds of music.

521
00:41:20,625 --> 00:41:21,958
Hm. I like everything.

522
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:25,833
Paper.

523
00:41:27,041 --> 00:41:27,916
Come here.

524
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:28,833
Hm?

525
00:41:28,916 --> 00:41:30,083
Over here.

526
00:41:32,166 --> 00:41:34,250
Do you know CG Radio Station?

527
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:36,083
CG.

528
00:41:36,166 --> 00:41:37,083
Mm-hm.

529
00:41:38,583 --> 00:41:39,791
Hm. Mm-mm.

530
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:45,541
So what do you think?

531
00:41:47,666 --> 00:41:50,041
Oh, come on.

532
00:41:50,875 --> 00:41:52,291
I meant the food.

533
00:42:01,083 --> 00:42:02,375
I do, Max.

534
00:42:18,791 --> 00:42:19,916
<i>Day.</i>

535
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,250
If you're on a date,
just don't eat like usual.

536
00:42:23,333 --> 00:42:24,458
You'll scare everyone.

537
00:42:34,208 --> 00:42:35,375
You eat so little.

538
00:42:35,875 --> 00:42:36,750
Oh!

539
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:39,583
Uh, this is how much I eat all the time.

540
00:42:41,916 --> 00:42:43,166
I'm full.

541
00:42:51,250 --> 00:42:53,208
Oh, please continue eating.

542
00:42:53,291 --> 00:42:55,041
Truly, I'm done. Mm-hm.

543
00:43:07,958 --> 00:43:10,166
Oh, right, and when you are on a date,

544
00:43:10,875 --> 00:43:12,375
be careful there's no dead air.

545
00:43:13,333 --> 00:43:14,666
Talk to him, okay?

546
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:16,500
If you can't think of anything
to talk about,

547
00:43:16,583 --> 00:43:18,458
go check out your chat.
I sent you topics.

548
00:43:18,541 --> 00:43:19,791
Uh-huh.

549
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:23,583
Deep talk.

550
00:43:23,666 --> 00:43:28,083
Topics for conversation
deeper than the weather and his outfit.

551
00:43:28,875 --> 00:43:29,791
Firstly…

552
00:43:29,875 --> 00:43:32,041
Tell me, what are you passionate about?

553
00:43:35,291 --> 00:43:36,541
Here, please.

554
00:43:38,791 --> 00:43:40,000
Deep question.

555
00:43:40,083 --> 00:43:41,458
It's hard to answer.

556
00:43:44,041 --> 00:43:46,583
So your passion, what is it?

557
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:50,375
Tell me
and then I'll tell you what mine is.

558
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,916
After the date,
your Gentleman will score you out of 10.

559
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,291
-Hm.
-So you need to be careful what you say.

560
00:44:00,375 --> 00:44:03,666
I'm really worried about you.
You haven't been on a date before.

561
00:44:04,250 --> 00:44:07,250
Yeah, I got it, Dr. Love Expert.

562
00:44:08,083 --> 00:44:11,708
Okay. So what about tips then?

563
00:44:11,791 --> 00:44:12,833
What do you got?

564
00:44:13,750 --> 00:44:17,666
If I were you, I'd do something like…
Hm.

565
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,708
Round my shoulders.

566
00:44:30,125 --> 00:44:32,666
Bat my eyelashes a little.

567
00:44:40,250 --> 00:44:42,333
My passion is the reason why I'm here.

568
00:44:43,291 --> 00:44:45,625
It's to become part of The Family, yeah.

569
00:44:45,708 --> 00:44:47,500
I'd also love to be…

570
00:44:48,583 --> 00:44:49,583
With you.

571
00:44:49,666 --> 00:44:51,833
-Are you serious?
-Yeah.

572
00:44:52,541 --> 00:44:55,291
And you? Your passion?

573
00:45:04,833 --> 00:45:06,083
You know what?

574
00:45:06,166 --> 00:45:08,166
I don't think
there's any point in mentioning it.

575
00:45:11,958 --> 00:45:13,125
Please?

576
00:45:13,958 --> 00:45:15,583
I'm really fascinated.

577
00:45:16,375 --> 00:45:18,791
And you promised. Hm?

578
00:45:21,125 --> 00:45:23,041
All right, I'll tell you
what my passion is.

579
00:45:25,083 --> 00:45:27,291
Probably the opposite
of everything you just said.

580
00:45:29,958 --> 00:45:30,958
Like I said…

581
00:45:31,875 --> 00:45:33,416
no point in me telling you about it.

582
00:45:48,708 --> 00:45:51,583
<i>The first date is now over.</i>

583
00:45:52,291 --> 00:45:56,875
<i>Gentlemen, please present</i>
<i>your scorecards for your dates.</i>

584
00:46:02,333 --> 00:46:03,166
Hm.

585
00:46:03,250 --> 00:46:06,166
Before we get to the scores,
I have a question to ask.

586
00:46:06,833 --> 00:46:09,166
Who is your favorite couple?

587
00:46:09,250 --> 00:46:12,291
Hm. I like Bovy and Paper.

588
00:46:12,375 --> 00:46:14,583
<i>It looked like they hit it off tonight,</i>

589
00:46:14,666 --> 00:46:18,083
<i>and that they really bonded</i>
<i>over their shared love of music.</i>

590
00:46:18,791 --> 00:46:20,583
<i>They have such good chemistry.</i>

591
00:46:20,666 --> 00:46:22,958
I think they'd be great together.

592
00:46:24,166 --> 00:46:25,375
Ooh!

593
00:46:27,041 --> 00:46:31,166
And another couple that I like
would be Almond and Kaew, right?

594
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:36,208
<i>They both love cooking,</i>
<i>which gave them a lot to talk about.</i>

595
00:46:36,291 --> 00:46:38,416
They also look good together.

596
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:41,958
This is a couple
I'm going to keep my eye on now.

597
00:46:46,208 --> 00:46:49,250
One couple I really like is Jin and Venus.

598
00:46:50,375 --> 00:46:54,333
<i>Jin looks like</i>
<i>he's absolutely smitten with his date.</i>

599
00:46:55,833 --> 00:46:59,208
Mm. A perfect 10. Whoo!

600
00:47:00,041 --> 00:47:01,166
Ooh!

601
00:47:01,250 --> 00:47:02,833
Ooh!

602
00:47:02,916 --> 00:47:05,375
A 10. Cool, huh?

603
00:47:05,458 --> 00:47:08,916
One couple I'd like to see more of
is Chanel and Max.

604
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:12,125
I have to say you look great.

605
00:47:14,250 --> 00:47:15,875
But I'm…

606
00:47:16,958 --> 00:47:18,208
so far away.

607
00:47:20,375 --> 00:47:21,750
Mind if I come a bit closer?

608
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:28,500
Well, if you'd like to,
you can sit closer.

609
00:47:38,041 --> 00:47:39,000
Are you cold?

610
00:47:39,791 --> 00:47:40,625
Oh!

611
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,583
Thank you, Max.

612
00:47:43,666 --> 00:47:44,750
I'm telling you.

613
00:47:45,958 --> 00:47:46,958
They make a good couple.

614
00:47:47,041 --> 00:47:48,916
That's right, Pob.

615
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,875
If I were Chanel, well,

616
00:47:50,958 --> 00:47:52,791
I'd be so in love by now.

617
00:47:56,958 --> 00:47:58,125
Ooh!

618
00:47:59,041 --> 00:48:00,250
Yay!

619
00:48:01,125 --> 00:48:04,541
<i>Son, it's time</i>
<i>to score your date.</i>

620
00:48:20,333 --> 00:48:21,875
Hey.

621
00:48:21,958 --> 00:48:23,125
Oh!

622
00:48:23,208 --> 00:48:24,666
Uh, what's that?

623
00:48:25,375 --> 00:48:27,375
-That's really mean, yeah.
-That's not nice.

624
00:48:27,458 --> 00:48:28,833
Why such a bad score?

625
00:48:31,458 --> 00:48:32,541
Hey!

626
00:48:33,333 --> 00:48:34,500
What happened?

627
00:48:34,583 --> 00:48:37,708
I know.
I've never seen a score as low as that.

628
00:48:37,791 --> 00:48:39,333
What a shame.

629
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:43,958
I know it's Son, but how could he possibly
give her a score like that?

630
00:48:44,041 --> 00:48:46,916
How? After he saved her
in the first round.

631
00:48:47,875 --> 00:48:51,000
What is he thinking?
It's got to be a mistake.

632
00:48:53,166 --> 00:48:56,625
Ah… Hold on.

633
00:48:56,708 --> 00:48:57,708
It's the wrong one.

634
00:48:59,250 --> 00:49:01,166
Wrong one. The wrong one.

635
00:49:06,708 --> 00:49:08,875
Hey!

636
00:49:08,958 --> 00:49:09,791
Huh?

637
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:12,375
Oh!

638
00:49:15,750 --> 00:49:17,000
<i>Son.</i>

639
00:49:20,375 --> 00:49:22,416
<i>Are you sure about this?</i>

640
00:49:25,750 --> 00:49:27,833
I am. This is it.

641
00:49:33,833 --> 00:49:35,708
And so,

642
00:49:35,791 --> 00:49:38,375
all of the dates
have been given their scores.

643
00:49:38,458 --> 00:49:39,333
What a night.

644
00:49:40,166 --> 00:49:42,666
Until next time. We'll see you then.

645
00:49:42,750 --> 00:49:44,125
Good night.

646
00:49:53,708 --> 00:49:54,958
Wait a minute.

647
00:50:05,708 --> 00:50:09,041
You been stalking anyone else?
Or am I the only lucky one?

648
00:50:11,208 --> 00:50:12,666
Why are you being like this?

649
00:50:12,750 --> 00:50:14,250
You're being so awful.

650
00:50:15,083 --> 00:50:15,958
Really?

651
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:17,458
How is that?

652
00:50:18,416 --> 00:50:22,333
I was trying to talk to you nicely
and appropriately on our first date.

653
00:50:22,958 --> 00:50:25,250
And you gave me that score. Why?

654
00:50:26,791 --> 00:50:28,500
Let go.

655
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:36,791
You know, that date was meant
for us to get to know each other.

656
00:50:37,916 --> 00:50:39,750
You know what I learned about you?

657
00:50:39,833 --> 00:50:41,833
Not even one tiny thing.

658
00:50:42,833 --> 00:50:46,333
I don't know what your plan was,
but you weren't yourself at all.

659
00:50:46,416 --> 00:50:47,416
You weren't being genuine.

660
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,916
"I want to become part of The Family."

661
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:53,958
"And it would be great

662
00:50:54,583 --> 00:50:56,125
if I were with you."

663
00:50:58,208 --> 00:51:00,625
I think you'd do
just about anything to win this.

664
00:51:01,208 --> 00:51:02,541
Or say anything.

665
00:51:04,083 --> 00:51:07,000
You're not allowed to judge me
while you're sitting in your golden tower.

666
00:51:07,958 --> 00:51:09,875
Living your government-funded happy life.

667
00:51:09,958 --> 00:51:12,416
Wearing your fancy clothes
and whatever else.

668
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:14,041
So don't be criticizing me.

669
00:51:14,125 --> 00:51:16,250
I'm a good person
and I'm trying really hard.

670
00:51:16,875 --> 00:51:18,541
Worry about who you are, okay?

671
00:51:21,125 --> 00:51:22,333
And yes,

672
00:51:22,416 --> 00:51:23,916
I would do almost anything…

673
00:51:24,541 --> 00:51:26,625
to have the sort of life you've got here.

674
00:51:27,666 --> 00:51:30,500
Not everyone
fell into the privilege that you did.

675
00:51:31,250 --> 00:51:33,875
I'm happy <i>not </i>to be like you.

676
00:51:44,583 --> 00:51:45,791
I'm sorry that

677
00:51:46,625 --> 00:51:48,166
I chose you for my date.

678
00:52:30,250 --> 00:52:31,625
<i>Is it real?</i>

679
00:52:32,708 --> 00:52:35,333
Um, I've got this old radio, you see.

680
00:52:35,416 --> 00:52:36,291
Uh-huh.

681
00:52:36,375 --> 00:52:39,250
Um, but I've looked for broadcasts

682
00:52:39,333 --> 00:52:41,625
and never found any.

683
00:52:43,958 --> 00:52:46,541
I thought radio was over

684
00:52:46,625 --> 00:52:48,541
and there were no broadcasts.

685
00:52:51,125 --> 00:52:53,791
Uh, hm, there is this one thing…

686
00:52:54,958 --> 00:52:55,958
that you could try.

687
00:53:18,833 --> 00:53:20,458

Aliens really exist.

699
00:54:15,208 --> 00:54:18,041
It's the only thing that makes sense.
It blows my mind.

700
00:54:18,666 --> 00:54:20,250
At some point you have to ask,

701
00:54:20,333 --> 00:54:22,500
why is the male population so low?

702
00:54:22,583 --> 00:54:26,458
Because aliens stopped men being born.
And I have evidence.

703
00:54:28,291 --> 00:54:30,416
Do you want me to tell you
where their base is?

704
00:54:35,083 --> 00:54:36,666
On The Farm. It's here.

705
00:54:37,958 --> 00:54:42,750
There is a restricted area
that even The Gentlemen can't get to.

706
00:54:42,833 --> 00:54:44,125
That's where they hide.

707
00:54:47,541 --> 00:54:48,958
Ah…

708
00:54:51,833 --> 00:54:53,833
Oh, interesting.

709
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:57,750
Do you have any more details
about that place?

710
00:54:58,875 --> 00:55:00,625
The, um…

711
00:55:01,916 --> 00:55:03,291
the restricted area.

712
00:55:07,541 --> 00:55:09,625
Hm. What is there for me to eat?

713
00:55:10,791 --> 00:55:11,625
Ah-ha!

714
00:55:12,333 --> 00:55:13,166
Noodles.

715
00:55:13,666 --> 00:55:15,875
Hot water, hot water.

716
00:55:15,958 --> 00:55:16,916
Uh…

717
00:55:17,625 --> 00:55:18,500
Hm…

718
00:55:20,333 --> 00:55:21,166
Oh!

719
00:56:07,083 --> 00:56:07,958
You want some?

720
00:56:19,291 --> 00:56:21,291
I'm so hungry.

721
00:56:23,166 --> 00:56:25,750
I was trying to be elegant
during our date.

722
00:56:25,833 --> 00:56:27,291
So I hardly ate anything.

723
00:56:29,625 --> 00:56:30,916
Pick me next time.

724
00:56:33,916 --> 00:56:35,791
Um, I'll give you a high score.

725
00:56:38,458 --> 00:56:39,291
Is that true?

726
00:56:39,958 --> 00:56:41,125
Yes.

727
00:56:44,666 --> 00:56:46,708
Would you cook me some food?

728
00:56:46,791 --> 00:56:48,458
I was about to make some dessert.

729
00:56:48,541 --> 00:56:51,083
Desserts too!
