1
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:33,950
THE TRUNK

2
00:00:35,618 --> 00:00:38,788
TWO YEARS AGO

3
00:00:56,806 --> 00:00:57,640
Cellar spiders.

4
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:05,231
They turn houses into abandoned houses.

5
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:08,151
You should kill them on sight.

6
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:26,503
But this isn't a house.

7
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,226
Please sign on the line marked "NM."

8
00:01:41,726 --> 00:01:44,187
We also offer a special shipping service
for this product--

9
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,522
I'll just take it myself.

10
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:46,898
I'll be taking a cab.

11
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:08,044
You can see that the compartments
are very convenient.

12
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:11,297
It'll be helpful
when organizing your baby's things.

13
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:15,009
Could we also take a look

14
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:18,263
at the trunk that woman just left with?

15
00:02:18,346 --> 00:02:19,180
Yes, of course.

16
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,226
I'm going to step out.

17
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:25,353
Sure.

18
00:02:52,463 --> 00:02:53,840
Divorce him, Ms. Noh In-ji.

19
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:02,891
Your father's passed.

20
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:06,436
I'm saying this is
where your punishment ends.

21
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:10,857
Both sides will receive alimony.

22
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:14,319
It's our fault the contract fell apart.

23
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:17,238
I also

24
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:19,866
got married through NM.

25
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:25,079
I'm sure you knew that.

26
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,169
Why aren't you sleeping?

27
00:04:57,547 --> 00:04:59,966
Is what Ms. Lee Seo-yeon said
keeping you up?

28
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:12,145
Did you know you kick the sheets
in your sleep?

29
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:15,356
Are you staying awake to tuck me in?

30
00:05:16,357 --> 00:05:18,234
At least one of us should be at ease.

31
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:45,970
What would make you feel at ease?

32
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:51,225
It would be even better
if both of us are at ease.

33
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:55,521
We wake up tomorrow morning

34
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:59,275
to find that we've aged about 20 years.

35
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:07,450
We find each other predictable and boring.

36
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:10,912
I know all the people that you know,

37
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:13,956
and you know all the people that I know.

38
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:19,796
Gossiping about them one by one
gives us joy.

39
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:23,549
With sleep still in our eyes,
we have breakfast together.

40
00:06:25,676 --> 00:06:28,805
We're stuck together the whole day,
bored by each other's company.

41
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:34,060
We grumble and complain,

42
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:36,687
then grill some fish for dinner

43
00:06:37,855 --> 00:06:39,273
and doze off together.

44
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:43,945
The next day,
we wake up like the day before.

45
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:46,531
Sounds incredibly dull.

46
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:50,368
Maybe.

47
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:54,080
I'll be that predictable person for you.

48
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:06,736
He's suddenly disappeared.

49
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:09,197
I'd been tracking him
through a chain of brokers.

50
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:13,868
I'll stop if you tell me to.

51
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:16,204
No.

52
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,831
Please keep searching.

53
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:26,172
Five months?

54
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:28,508
Twenty-four weeks.

55
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,677
Your husband hasn't changed his mind?

56
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,514
What are they gonna do?
I can't have the procedure now.

57
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:49,654
SENDER NOH IN-JI
DEPOSIT 20,000,000 WON

58
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:52,949
It's too much.

59
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:55,409
You'll have a lot to do
once the baby arrives.

60
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:57,912
Get a room first, even if it's small.

61
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:01,290
Somewhere your husband won't find.

62
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:11,133
I never thought I'd find myself thanking

63
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:13,678
a rude-ass southerner.

64
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,847
If you lose your child,

65
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,183
you'll look back on this time
as a living hell.

66
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:21,227
No need to thank me in advance.

67
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:25,189
Don't get too attached to marriage either.

68
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:27,066
Divorce is…

69
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:35,825
no big deal.

70
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:49,505
You have to see this.

71
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:27,960
HAN JEONG-WON

72
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,548
When did you leave?

73
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:34,550
Early this morning.

74
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:37,219
Why? Is something wrong?

75
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:40,014
No, I was just wondering
if something was up.

76
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,517
Good to know you're okay.

77
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:45,061
All right.

78
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:47,605
I'm afraid I can't join you
for breakfast today.

79
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:31,482
Ms. Do-dam said someone's been sneaking in
and killing the goldfish every night.

80
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:34,819
I thought it was just nonsense,
but she made me uneasy.

81
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:36,404
So I recorded some footage,

82
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:38,781
but I never expected to see this.

83
00:11:41,283 --> 00:11:43,828
That's the homeowner prick, right?
The attempted spouse.

84
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:48,416
So what should I call him? Aquaman?

85
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:51,544
It wasn't him.

86
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:55,005
I'd know if he had been here.

87
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:59,343
Who else would come through the front door
in the middle of the night

88
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:01,887
just to stare into the fish tank
like some nutjob?

89
00:13:00,404 --> 00:13:03,324
Buy me some food, would you?
I want to talk.

90
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:29,767
I feel weird whenever I eat this.

91
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:35,105
It reminds me that the things we eat
were all alive and kicking once.

92
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:39,652
It's only natural to feel uneasy
when eating another's flesh.

93
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:47,535
That's what makes it good.

94
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,163
If this is why you--

95
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:53,999
Of course,
we're here to discuss Noh In-ji.

96
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:06,929
You know about the perverted sicko
she almost married, don't you?

97
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:11,809
So you do know.

98
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:14,812
She's registered at his address.

99
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:18,649
My point is, it's been five years
since that fucker disappeared,

100
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:20,526
but she's still there.

101
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:24,822
Why is she so hung up
on that dirty bastard anyway?

102
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:26,949
Don't you agree?

103
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:32,079
Call the cops. Whether or not it was him,
we have a problem.

104
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,832
And say what? This isn't even my house.

105
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,960
"Someone broke into
the apartment of my ex-fiancé,

106
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:40,296
who disappeared five years ago,
to clean the fish tank"?

107
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:42,339
Should I also mention

108
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:44,717
that I'm still living in his house
just to spite him?

109
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,552
Is that what I should tell the cops?

110
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:47,803
Damn it.

111
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:50,014
For starters,

112
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:52,182
I'll change the door code.

113
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:56,228
Don't tell Ms. Do-dam the new code.

114
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:57,730
She's a total blabbermouth.

115
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:00,733
In-ji.

116
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,903
You do know this isn't normal, right?

117
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:09,325
Where are you going?

118
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:10,993
I need to check something.

119
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:19,126
She was in our workshop
for about three months.

120
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:22,379
Her company offered perks
for soon-to-be-married star employees,

121
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:23,380
like cooking classes.

122
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:27,301
I thought they looked great together
until I found out.

123
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:30,179
Like those picture-perfect couples
that make you do a double take.

124
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:32,222
But in the end,

125
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:36,477
I had to witness Noh In-ji's life
fall apart right before my eyes.

126
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:39,438
"Fall apart"?

127
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:43,859
A week or so before the wedding,
a string of photos surfaced online.

128
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:47,321
Photos of men
climbing all over each other…

129
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:51,200
nibbling and sucking.

130
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:56,872
What do you think happened
after thousands of people saw them?

131
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:06,966
The guy vanished,

132
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:10,177
leaving In-ji to deal with the fallout.

133
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,930
Those fucking conglomerate bastards.

134
00:16:13,597 --> 00:16:15,516
Their legal team asked her for a statement

135
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:17,810
and promised
it wouldn't come up again later.

136
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:21,146
They didn't want
to be labeled homo-haters.

137
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:27,778
I bet you don't even know what hate is.

138
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:32,116
You have no idea…

139
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:38,372
how hatred can make
a person shrivel inside.

140
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:49,091
Noh In-ji is an orphan.

141
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:52,845
She cut ties with her family
and disconnected from her emotions.

142
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:58,726
She's so fucking tenacious.

143
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:03,647
That's why I worship her.

144
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:16,452
Why not just call me a bitch?

145
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:19,288
You people think vulgarity
levels the playing field.

146
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:21,081
Why aren't you saying anything?

147
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:23,083
Because I know.

148
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:27,421
Do you really want a divorce?

149
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:30,299
Yeah.

150
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:33,552
You'll be miserable
with Mr. Han Jeong-won.

151
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:36,472
You'd be happy with me.

152
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:39,767
You're just delusional.

153
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:41,643
Or maybe it's your work ethic.

154
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:49,693
- Double-check, just in case.
- Of course.

155
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:52,237
The employees are hardworking.

156
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:54,490
I'm sure we'll finish on time.

157
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:14,510
This room is the last one.

158
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:17,679
Let me know what you'd like,
and I'll be happy to accommodate.

159
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,516
What on earth are you thinking?

160
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,184
You mean the divorce?

161
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:27,272
You're the one who said
I should go ahead with this marriage.

162
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:29,608
This is no longer just between us.

163
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:31,777
So it's between the four of us?

164
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:35,781
When you violate a contract,
you pay the fine.

165
00:18:35,864 --> 00:18:37,616
There's no more or less to it.

166
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:47,668
Stop resisting
and just take the meds I gave you.

167
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:50,337
Are drugs your solution to everything?

168
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:52,923
Why the hell did you change your mind?

169
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,136
Because I've seen all I needed to.

170
00:18:58,053 --> 00:18:59,513
Do I need to explain further?

171
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:02,266
End things quickly with Noh In-ji.

172
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:05,144
So we can return to normal
just as quickly.

173
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:26,039
OPEN DOOR

174
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:30,002
Are drugs your solution to everything?

175
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,338
Why the hell did you change your mind?

176
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:43,056
Come get me.
I'm not feeling well and need to go home.

177
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:45,601
I don't think I can right now.

178
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:47,436
We have a guest.

179
00:19:48,645 --> 00:19:49,479
"A guest"?

180
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:52,399
Ms. Noh In-ji is here.

181
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:16,423
Tea is boring. Try this.

182
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,800
It's non-alcoholic, but it's not bad.

183
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:24,264
I didn't think you'd come here.

184
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:29,269
I needed to check something.

185
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:32,272
And what will you do after checking?

186
00:20:34,274 --> 00:20:35,901
Do you know the Judgment of Solomon?

187
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:38,153
The story of the real mother
and the fake mother?

188
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:41,073
SEO-YEON

189
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:45,035
Sir!

190
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:47,788
Would you please step on it?

191
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:51,917
That judgment always struck me as odd.

192
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:56,088
Fake mom or not, how could anyone agree
to a baby being cut in half?

193
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:59,007
Her callous disregard for the baby's life

194
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:01,843
implies she was but an empty husk,

195
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:04,263
alive but not truly living.

196
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:07,349
I feel sorry for her.

197
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,270
Or maybe she was the biggest bitch

198
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:14,147
of 3,000 years ago.

199
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:21,029
She'll be here soon.

200
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,665
You shouldn't let wine stains sit.

201
00:21:32,874 --> 00:21:34,209
Use the upstairs bathroom.

202
00:21:35,585 --> 00:21:37,546
It's just to the left…

203
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:40,716
of Seo-yeon's study.

204
00:23:30,992 --> 00:23:33,203
No, I was just wondering
if something was up.

205
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:35,330
Good to know you're okay.

206
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:37,082
All right.

207
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:40,377
I'm afraid I can't join you
for breakfast today.

208
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:05,569
When will you be home?

209
00:24:36,516 --> 00:24:37,684
Why didn't you pick up?

210
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:40,896
I forgot to bring my phone.

211
00:24:41,688 --> 00:24:42,606
I was in the bath.

212
00:24:44,774 --> 00:24:45,901
Where's Ms. Noh In-ji?

213
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:47,527
She left a while ago.

214
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:50,363
I should have told you she left.

215
00:24:57,913 --> 00:24:59,122
What did you talk about?

216
00:24:59,706 --> 00:25:03,210
A strategy meeting between colleagues
ahead of a contract cancellation.

217
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:08,590
Would telling you that
give you peace of mind?

218
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:02,060
What did you do today?

219
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:06,773
I met a friend because something happened
at my old house.

220
00:26:09,192 --> 00:26:10,026
Your old house…

221
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:15,991
I ran into someone I know.

222
00:26:16,866 --> 00:26:19,035
We're not close,
but we ended up drinking soju together.

223
00:26:21,204 --> 00:26:22,664
Did you enjoy the soju?

224
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:26,459
I don't remember.

225
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:47,897
Why don't you head upstairs with the beer?

226
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:50,567
Sure.

227
00:27:53,129 --> 00:27:54,089
I found her supplier.

228
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:57,342
Mr. Yoon.
Seems like he's famous on the scene.

229
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:00,470
Where can I find him?

230
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:13,274
Got more of that stuff?

231
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:16,945
Let's talk in person.

232
00:28:21,991 --> 00:28:23,576
I'll come to your office tomorrow.

233
00:29:10,623 --> 00:29:13,168
Did you use Jeong-won's phone
to mess with me?

234
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:17,589
I just wanted to know
why you're doing this.

235
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:19,924
Do you know Han Jeong-won?

236
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:22,343
I'm guessing you think you do.

237
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:24,637
Is that why you do this?

238
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:26,973
You're crossing the line.

239
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:29,768
You two will be divorced soon anyway.

240
00:29:31,227 --> 00:29:32,061
No.

241
00:29:32,812 --> 00:29:34,230
We won't be getting a divorce

242
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:36,107
because I refuse.

243
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:41,196
The manual states only the married couple
can decide to divorce.

244
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:43,656
Isn't that how marriages work?

245
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:48,703
Leave him alone.

246
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:51,331
I came here to warn you.

247
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:57,962
You should've said that sooner,
and to your mother.

248
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:01,341
You should've said,
"Don't mess with my man."

249
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:07,889
Come to think of it, you have a knack
for making those around you miserable,

250
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:10,475
even though you're a nobody.

251
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:14,354
I finally know for sure

252
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:17,232
that, even 3,000 years later,

253
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:20,443
bitches will be bitches.

254
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:57,981
These pills are like meth.
Why do you keep pushing them on him?

255
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:03,444
Do you really think
I gave him those to take?

256
00:31:04,153 --> 00:31:05,071
Why else?

257
00:31:06,739 --> 00:31:09,325
I don't think I owe you an explanation.

258
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:16,291
Does your client know?

259
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:20,962
That you hired a junkie to work on-site
just to get your hands on this stuff?

260
00:31:23,172 --> 00:31:27,051
Was that enough of a threat
to give you nightmares tonight?

261
00:31:28,469 --> 00:31:30,221
Or do I need to move to plan B?

262
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:44,402
Are you threatening me?

263
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:48,489
It's more than just a threat.

264
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:50,325
What kind of person

265
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:53,912
installs a camera in the same spot
Han Jeong-won's despicable father used

266
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:55,663
to spy on his mother?

267
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:06,299
You'd hoped he'd give in and take these!

268
00:32:08,134 --> 00:32:10,887
You needed to break Han Jeong-won
so he'd come back to you!

269
00:32:12,138 --> 00:32:14,432
Did you get a kick out of spying on him
through the cameras?

270
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:18,853
Did you feel like a god
having him in the palm of your hand?

271
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:21,981
How could anyone do such things?

272
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:24,901
And you still call yourself human?

273
00:32:35,536 --> 00:32:36,955
Why are you doing all this?

274
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:39,165
Why are you taking this so far?

275
00:33:09,362 --> 00:33:10,530
What the hell would you know?

276
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:12,490
This is between me and Jeong-won!

277
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:14,617
This is our life!

278
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:16,119
Whose life?

279
00:34:03,082 --> 00:34:04,751
Aren't we getting divorced?

280
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:07,003
How can I get over you
if you act like this?

281
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:11,340
I can never say no to you,

282
00:34:11,966 --> 00:34:13,426
so there's no way for me to stop it.

283
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,054
I'm only human.

284
00:34:35,948 --> 00:34:37,325
The director likes the music.

285
00:34:37,825 --> 00:34:40,078
They did ask for small changes
here and there.

286
00:34:41,871 --> 00:34:44,832
I guess they share your eccentric taste.

287
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:49,087
What happens with Ms. Noh In-ji
once your contract ends?

288
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:55,301
I hope you won't go back to Seo-yeon.

289
00:34:56,385 --> 00:34:58,513
I don't know what Lee Seo-yeon's thinking,

290
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:00,848
but for you,
it's an opportunity to escape.

291
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:01,766
Don't you agree?

292
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,310
Seo-yeon told me to get a divorce.

293
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:05,937
That crazy…

294
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:10,066
I've fallen for Noh In-ji.

295
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:15,863
Since when?

296
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:18,407
It's a long story.

297
00:35:21,577 --> 00:35:25,540
You know you can't have
a serious relationship with her, right?

298
00:35:28,584 --> 00:35:29,710
Why not?

299
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:31,337
Didn't you read the manual?

300
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:35,049
You literally can't do anything
with Noh In-ji.

301
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:37,760
"Couples matched through NM
may only be married through NM."

302
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:40,221
It's the very first thing
written in the manual.

303
00:35:50,064 --> 00:35:52,692
Fucking hell, how do you do it again?

304
00:35:52,775 --> 00:35:53,609
Maybe like this?

305
00:35:55,736 --> 00:35:56,654
Right.

306
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:05,371
The hell are you doing?

307
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:22,346
She says it's not that punk.

308
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:25,641
Do you agree that it's not him?

309
00:36:26,392 --> 00:36:27,768
My vision is all blurry.

310
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:28,936
I can't tell.

311
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:31,397
My eyes are going.

312
00:36:32,064 --> 00:36:34,859
Your eyes have been going
for a good while now.

313
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:37,570
Just take a closer look.

314
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:42,033
- Five years is a long time.
- It really is.

315
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:45,953
If he'd said something before leaving,
In-ji wouldn't keep coming back here.

316
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:49,123
She wouldn't care
what happened to this house.

317
00:36:49,957 --> 00:36:51,542
I honestly think

318
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:54,545
she's been acting this way
because he never gave her closure.

319
00:38:22,216 --> 00:38:23,634
Have you eaten?

320
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:27,179
No.

321
00:38:29,265 --> 00:38:30,516
I'm hungry.

322
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:42,069
Two cheeseburger combos
without tomatoes, please.

323
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:43,195
Sure.

324
00:38:44,071 --> 00:38:45,823
I'll have that ready for you
in just a sec.

325
00:38:55,791 --> 00:38:58,878
Your cheeseburgers are ready.
Please enjoy.

326
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:00,254
Thank you.

327
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:20,649
I asked for them to be removed
from both burgers

328
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:22,818
because we're vegetarians.

329
00:39:26,238 --> 00:39:27,073
Thank you.

330
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:34,872
I missed you all day.

331
00:39:39,585 --> 00:39:41,754
Missing you has made it a tough day.

332
00:39:54,433 --> 00:39:56,268
It wasn't as bad for me.

333
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:17,790
I missed you too.

334
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:14,698
Back up.

335
00:42:15,616 --> 00:42:18,327
I'll back us out of here.

336
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:19,578
I'm good now, aren't I?

337
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:25,960
Why'd you learn to kayak?

338
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:27,169
Because I couldn't swim.

339
00:42:28,587 --> 00:42:29,421
Seriously?

340
00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:33,551
I almost drowned in a river
when I was little.

341
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:37,972
After that,
I couldn't bring myself to swim.

342
00:42:40,182 --> 00:42:42,393
I tried to learn again
when I was in college…

343
00:42:44,436 --> 00:42:45,271
but then,

344
00:42:47,147 --> 00:42:49,316
a close friend of mine drowned.

345
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:51,527
It was suicide.

346
00:42:55,614 --> 00:42:56,949
I haven't been able to swim since.

347
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:04,873
I only meant to ask
why you learned how to kayak.

348
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:07,918
Now I'm hesitant to ask you anything else.

349
00:43:12,506 --> 00:43:14,049
Why do you enjoy kayaking?

350
00:43:19,096 --> 00:43:21,181
When I'm on a kayak,
I feel like an island.

351
00:43:23,058 --> 00:43:26,979
Like I'm a floating island
that no one can reach.

352
00:43:57,551 --> 00:43:59,386
HUSBAND

353
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:03,474
Yes?

354
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:06,852
I'll head out right away.

355
00:44:23,786 --> 00:44:26,830
Ms. Lee, I gave you a job.
Shouldn't there be some progress by now?

356
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:28,165
What's the status?

357
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:33,379
You kept me in the dark so long,
I just had to come to see you.

358
00:44:35,214 --> 00:44:36,256
Who…

359
00:44:50,229 --> 00:44:51,105
What tea is this?

360
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:53,232
It tastes great.

361
00:44:57,277 --> 00:44:59,196
Could you pack some for me before I leave?

362
00:45:03,617 --> 00:45:04,743
Why are you here?

363
00:45:07,579 --> 00:45:10,708
It's such a small world,

364
00:45:11,417 --> 00:45:12,334
isn't it?

365
00:45:14,712 --> 00:45:16,964
I met an old friend not long ago.

366
00:45:17,506 --> 00:45:19,967
They told me
about a strange job they worked on,

367
00:45:20,467 --> 00:45:23,262
where they attached
hidden cameras to a light.

368
00:45:25,097 --> 00:45:27,182
I believe the lights were from France.

369
00:45:28,517 --> 00:45:31,854
They said they were rare.
That there are only a few in the country.

370
00:45:32,896 --> 00:45:34,481
A special order, that was it.

371
00:45:34,982 --> 00:45:37,317
They had to jump through hoops to buy it.

372
00:45:39,611 --> 00:45:40,446
I wonder…

373
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:45,743
why anyone would put hidden cameras there.

374
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:56,253
I'm just dying to find out.

375
00:46:24,907 --> 00:46:27,409
If I'm being completely honest,

376
00:46:27,993 --> 00:46:32,331
I didn't want to speak badly of someone
who's already dead,

377
00:46:32,831 --> 00:46:35,042
so I couldn't tell you everything
last time.

378
00:46:36,502 --> 00:46:37,711
The thing is,

379
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:40,214
he didn't exactly seem normal.

380
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:42,674
How so?

381
00:46:44,092 --> 00:46:45,636
Well,

382
00:46:46,553 --> 00:46:48,555
he had a knack for making enemies.

383
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:52,017
I guess you could say he was unstable.

384
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:55,938
Which individuals held ill will
towards Mr. Eom Tae-seong?

385
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:58,690
I wouldn't know for sure,

386
00:46:58,774 --> 00:47:02,110
but I doubt anyone liked him
after interacting with him.

387
00:47:02,194 --> 00:47:04,530
Seo-yeon didn't seem to like him either.

388
00:47:04,613 --> 00:47:07,157
She said this in passing,
so I'm not sure if I heard her correctly,

389
00:47:08,951 --> 00:47:11,537
but I think she told me
that he tried to blackmail her.

390
00:47:14,873 --> 00:47:17,668
Then again, I don't know the whole story.

391
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:22,589
"Blackmail"?

392
00:47:35,561 --> 00:47:37,145
Can we listen to just the sound effects?

393
00:47:37,229 --> 00:47:38,814
Sound effects, coming right up.

394
00:47:46,071 --> 00:47:49,533
I know a killer beef tripe hot pot place.
Want to have lunch together?

395
00:47:59,293 --> 00:48:00,961
Or I can just eat with Ms. In-ji.

396
00:48:17,311 --> 00:48:19,271
The stab wound is from way before he died,

397
00:48:19,354 --> 00:48:22,149
and judging by its size,
I'd say it was done with a fruit knife.

398
00:48:22,232 --> 00:48:23,233
It's pretty deep.

399
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:29,156
- If Eom Tae-seong was stabbed this badly--
- He would have killed whoever stabbed him.

400
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:31,074
Right, but we have nothing.

401
00:48:31,158 --> 00:48:33,160
No sign of a struggle or anything.

402
00:48:34,661 --> 00:48:36,914
- Do you think it was self-harm?
- What? This guy?

403
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:39,583
And people don't self-harm just once.

404
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:41,251
It's a habit.

405
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:53,889
I thought you'd treat me.

406
00:48:55,182 --> 00:48:56,391
What do you have to say?

407
00:48:58,560 --> 00:48:59,686
That man's house

408
00:49:00,312 --> 00:49:03,649
has been vacant for five years,
but In-ji's been taking care of it.

409
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:08,445
It hasn't changed at all since then.
She hasn't changed a thing.

410
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:11,865
How do you know that?

411
00:49:16,328 --> 00:49:17,329
Picking a lock's easy.

412
00:49:20,582 --> 00:49:21,625
By the way…

413
00:49:23,919 --> 00:49:25,379
why do you think she picked you?

414
00:49:26,838 --> 00:49:30,425
In-ji's first and fourth husbands
were both suffering from diseases.

415
00:49:31,677 --> 00:49:32,511
Terminally ill.

416
00:49:33,011 --> 00:49:34,304
One of them was a gay guy

417
00:49:34,888 --> 00:49:37,140
who only got married
because his family insisted.

418
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:38,433
And the other one…

419
00:49:40,727 --> 00:49:42,854
had no interest in doing it.

420
00:49:44,439 --> 00:49:46,650
Who knows if he didn't want to
or just couldn't?

421
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:49,945
So why you?

422
00:49:54,449 --> 00:49:57,285
Did your wife divorce you
because you couldn't get it up?

423
00:49:59,997 --> 00:50:01,123
Come on,

424
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:04,418
I'm just kidding.

425
00:50:10,173 --> 00:50:12,384
Anyway, the conclusion is…

426
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:20,892
I think it's my destiny
to perish alongside Ms. In-ji.

427
00:50:22,811 --> 00:50:24,479
If I can't have her…

428
00:50:27,774 --> 00:50:29,276
maybe that wouldn't be so bad,

429
00:50:30,235 --> 00:50:31,361
don't you think?

430
00:50:35,407 --> 00:50:37,784
How long have you known Han Jeong-won?

431
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:40,954
He must have been around 17 or so.

432
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:42,330
After his mother's suicide,

433
00:50:43,081 --> 00:50:44,624
he started to rely on drugs.

434
00:50:46,585 --> 00:50:49,629
It was even a small story
on the news back then.

435
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:53,467
"Underage son of corporate CEO
arrested for drug abuse."

436
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:55,093
At the time, he was carrying

437
00:50:56,094 --> 00:50:58,513
a pill with a synthetic cannabinoid.

438
00:50:59,222 --> 00:51:01,558
You rarely see that kind of drug,
even today.

439
00:51:01,641 --> 00:51:03,518
It's time-consuming
and expensive to produce.

440
00:51:06,104 --> 00:51:07,397
It had an odd name,

441
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:10,317
so between us,
we initially called it "the blue pill."

442
00:51:13,361 --> 00:51:14,780
Did he ever go back on it?

443
00:51:16,031 --> 00:51:19,951
I've always had my suspicions,
but I've always had no evidence.

444
00:51:21,995 --> 00:51:25,624
Did Han Jeong-won kill someone?

445
00:51:26,583 --> 00:51:27,501
Not yet.

446
00:51:27,584 --> 00:51:28,668
Please help yourself.

447
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:21,740
The person you have called…

448
00:53:21,823 --> 00:53:23,783
NOH IN-JI

449
00:53:28,622 --> 00:53:29,456
Hello?

450
00:53:32,751 --> 00:53:34,044
Where are you now?

451
00:53:34,127 --> 00:53:35,003
You're home, right?

452
00:53:35,503 --> 00:53:37,589
I needed to leave
to take care of something.

453
00:53:38,173 --> 00:53:39,007
Where to?

454
00:53:39,674 --> 00:53:40,634
My old house.

455
00:53:41,635 --> 00:53:43,303
I'd appreciate it if you could come back.

456
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:46,264
Is something wrong?

457
00:53:48,475 --> 00:53:50,477
Can you just come back home?

458
00:53:52,646 --> 00:53:54,022
Or I'll come to you.

459
00:53:54,105 --> 00:53:54,940
Where are you?

460
00:53:55,023 --> 00:53:56,233
This won't take long.

461
00:53:57,234 --> 00:53:58,151
I'll be back soon.

462
00:54:35,563 --> 00:54:36,398
What the…

463
00:54:42,904 --> 00:54:43,738
The heck?

464
00:54:47,534 --> 00:54:48,785
This is the right…

465
00:54:53,665 --> 00:54:55,375
What the fuck is going on?

466
00:54:59,337 --> 00:55:00,171
Damn it!

467
00:55:11,766 --> 00:55:12,684
Ms. In-ji?

468
00:58:56,157 --> 00:58:59,452
