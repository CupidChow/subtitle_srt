00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:33,950
THE TRUNK

2
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:38,621
LATE SO HYE-YEONG

3
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:20,205
This is a pretty lonely
memorial service, isn't it?

4
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:26,169
I'm sorry for leaving you all alone.

5
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:29,881
If we ever meet again…

6
00:01:31,966 --> 00:01:33,802
I'll make sure to stay by your side.

7
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:40,308
I won't leave you by yourself.

8
00:01:49,734 --> 00:01:51,111
Were there a lot of people?

9
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:52,779
Yes.

10
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:54,656
Yeah, right.

11
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,826
We're all Hye-yeong had.
Who else would come?

12
00:01:59,994 --> 00:02:01,454
I'm sorry I couldn't make it.

13
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:04,332
It's not like you missed it on purpose.

14
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:07,669
It's fine.

15
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,339
YEONHEE UNIVERSITY
GRADUATION GOWN AND CAP RENTALS

16
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:33,087
Did someone pass away?

17
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:38,426
A friend.

18
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:42,847
Do people wear mourning hairpins
even when friends pass?

19
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:49,437
She had no family.

20
00:03:51,272 --> 00:03:52,941
Also, it feels like I killed her.

21
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:55,360
How about you?

22
00:03:59,155 --> 00:04:00,240
My mom passed.

23
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:07,538
I also feel like I killed her.

24
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:32,563
You probably

25
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:35,650
weren't the reason she died.

26
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:48,997
HAN JEONG-WON

27
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:55,003
THE TRUNK

28
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:32,433
Are you all right?

29
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:36,562
It's not my blood.

30
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:39,357
How do you know about this place?

31
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:42,485
This was your address on the contract.

32
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:00,169
If Eom Tae-seong was here…

33
00:07:02,338 --> 00:07:03,631
Is this the house of that man?

34
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:06,008
The one your mother killed.

35
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:11,139
What's it to you?

36
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:15,601
I'm just worried.

37
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:17,228
Don't worry about it. Just leave.

38
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:19,397
This is none of your concern.

39
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,609
Aren't married couples
allowed to be concerned?

40
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:25,778
You said you're my wife.

41
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:30,616
You think we have something special?

42
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:35,163
You're as selfish as ever.

43
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:36,706
And so childish.

44
00:07:38,332 --> 00:07:39,917
Why must it always be your way?

45
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:44,547
I just did my duty.

46
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,466
It's part of the job, in the manual.

47
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:49,594
The only reason I grilled fish
and cooked every morning

48
00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:52,555
is so you could experience
a sense of normalcy.

49
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:54,557
So don't overstep.

50
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:59,437
Does curating the perfect marriage
fill you with pride?

51
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:03,024
Here you are, unable to leave this house.

52
00:08:04,358 --> 00:08:07,945
Does the pride you feel
from saving others lessen your guilt?

53
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:12,325
You're also a part
of such a conceited marriage.

54
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,288
So there's no reason for you to be here,
worrying about me.

55
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:20,458
Stop meddling in my affairs.

56
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:25,129
Eom Tae-seong or not,
this has nothing to do with you!

57
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:30,176
If you understand, leave.
This is my space.

58
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:33,679
You know it's not your space.

59
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:37,850
It's just a hollow shell

60
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,853
that you're still clinging to.

61
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,070
What are you so afraid of?

62
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:53,866
Are you afraid
that you might actually fall for me?

63
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:02,166
Just leave.

64
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:05,294
Go back to your fancy house.

65
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:56,637
How may I help you?

66
00:09:57,847 --> 00:10:00,725
Anti-inflammatory drugs,
antibiotics, and painkillers.

67
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:04,103
Antiseptics and bandages.
Give me the strongest ones you've got.

68
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:06,606
How were you injured?

69
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:09,525
Let's say I had an accident
with a screwdriver.

70
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:12,695
It'd be better to go to the ER.

71
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:16,949
This bitch must be fucking joking.

72
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:24,832
Just give them to me, okay?

73
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,710
Give me the meds!

74
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:45,978
Mr. Seo Do-ha, you sure have changed.

75
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:49,523
This is so out of character for you.

76
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:51,901
You're the one

77
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:54,528
who made me like this.

78
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:58,991
Did you think that I wouldn't know
what you did five years ago?

79
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,329
You knew I was the one
who sent those clips?

80
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,415
Noh In-ji's mom did everything.

81
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:09,627
I just acted in the public interest
and sent her a tip.

82
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:11,921
Wait.

83
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:13,339
If I kill you and disappear,

84
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:15,466
it would all be over.

85
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:18,386
Show your face here again,

86
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:20,429
and you die.

87
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:43,411
Ma'am,

88
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:45,705
have I done something wrong?

89
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:49,125
Look. I'm hurt.

90
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:54,088
Look, lady.

91
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:58,384
Have I done anything to you?

92
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:03,639
For fuck's sake.

93
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:14,650
It won't come out.

94
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:18,654
Anyway, things don't look great here.

95
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,073
Right, I understand.

96
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:23,868
Hey, hang up.

97
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:38,966
Is this Eom Tae-seong's blood?

98
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:43,471
Good God, so it is.

99
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:47,057
I finally get to see your face.

100
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:51,437
I'm Ms. Do-dam. I live next door.

101
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:55,149
I know In-ji well enough to know
she's been brooding here for five years

102
00:12:58,027 --> 00:12:59,945
How long has this been going on?

103
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:01,530
You took your time showing up.

104
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:04,241
Why not ask once she's bloody dead?
For heaven's sake.

105
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:11,749
I heard that Eom Tae-seong's
been clinging to In-ji and harassing her.

106
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,543
I also heard that he killed someone.

107
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:29,350
Frustrating.

108
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:31,644
So frustrating.

109
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,366
Manual, my ass.

110
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:22,880
Strawberries used to be a luxury for me,

111
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:25,925
but now I dig in without a second thought.

112
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:30,971
I mindlessly gorge myself on them.

113
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:36,435
He told me to have the baby,

114
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,897
but he won't be involved at all.

115
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:42,816
I thanked him
and said he'll never see us again.

116
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:45,235
That's great to hear.

117
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:48,989
I've been on the run all my life,

118
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,534
but I finally feel like
I've put down roots.

119
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:55,996
I'm going to have this baby
and raise it well.

120
00:15:56,997 --> 00:15:58,290
It's a jungle out there,

121
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:01,001
and if the baby takes after me,
they'll be a handful…

122
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:04,630
but I want them to be happy.

123
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:11,261
By the way, you don't look so great.

124
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:15,015
I had an argument with my husband.

125
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:16,892
You actually argue?

126
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:20,062
He said that I was afraid.

127
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:25,693
Big words from a guy
who's never left that house of his.

128
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:35,536
You can stop looking for him now.

129
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:37,746
Why's that?

130
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:39,665
He came back.

131
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:41,792
Did you meet with him?

132
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:48,090
Do you feel like running away
now that you can finally meet him again?

133
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:53,971
You are afraid, Ms. Noh.

134
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:09,820
She waited five years in that house
for a guy who might never return.

135
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:11,947
Do you also think I overstepped?

136
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:17,036
She has no idea how stubborn she can be
or how much danger she's in right now.

137
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:20,789
She's so full of herself.

138
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:25,335
She literally moved into my house,
so why can't I visit hers?

139
00:17:26,628 --> 00:17:29,965
Why does she cling to that house
like her life depends on it?

140
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:33,761
Why are you getting so worked up?
Who are you to her anyway?

141
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:45,689
Something came up, so I left early.
I'm sorry about yesterday. I went too far.

142
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:48,859
What is it?

143
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:50,319
What did she say?

144
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:53,864
She said she's sorry.

145
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:55,199
That settles that, no?

146
00:17:58,452 --> 00:17:59,828
I'm not mad at her.

147
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:03,665
I'm worried about her.

148
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:16,261
We've tightened security in the area.
Shall we do the same for your house?

149
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:19,348
Please install cameras inside the house.

150
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:22,392
Are you sure that'll be okay?

151
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:24,603
Yes. Please do it.

152
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:49,461
I think it's my destiny
to perish alongside Ms. In-ji.

153
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:51,338
If I can't have her…

154
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:55,342
maybe that wouldn't be so bad.

155
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:11,233
The bloodstains aren't Seo Do-ha's.

156
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:14,361
Ms. Do-dam saw him, and he looked fine.

157
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:17,239
I guess he wasn't the victim.

158
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:22,411
You should at least see the jerk.

159
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:25,414
I'll take care of it.

160
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:27,124
You'll deal with it? As if.

161
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:29,918
When you first told me
about that weird marriage thing,

162
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:34,506
I figured you were doing what you could
to live despite your broken heart.

163
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:37,885
After my mom and dad got divorced,

164
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:40,679
my aunts took turns raising me.

165
00:19:40,762 --> 00:19:43,557
I lived like an orphan for five years,
walking on eggshells,

166
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:48,270
and only learned what family was
when I met you guys in high school.

167
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:51,857
Hye-yeong actually was an orphan,

168
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:55,194
and you cut ties with your mom in college.

169
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:58,488
Until Hye-yeong died,
the three of us would say,

170
00:19:58,572 --> 00:20:01,950
"Who needs marriage
when we're already a perfect family?"

171
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:04,244
She's the bitch for dying.

172
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,330
A disloyal bitch.

173
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,589
My aunt was insufferable
until the moment she croaked.

174
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,550
My biggest regret
is having stayed by her deathbed

175
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:21,553
instead of attending Hye-yeong's funeral.

176
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:26,433
My point is,
I'm the only family you've got.

177
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:29,228
I know the marriage must end
once you end things with Seo Do-ha.

178
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:32,022
It's just work.

179
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:34,358
Come on!

180
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:36,902
You think I don't know you?

181
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:39,780
I can tell if your tears
are from sadness or anger

182
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:41,406
just by looking at your puffy eyes.

183
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:44,409
You used to be so withdrawn,
but with Han Jeong-won, you're like a--

184
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:46,578
You've fallen for him!

185
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,876
There's nothing for you to worry about.

186
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:55,128
It'll be over once the contract ends.

187
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:38,797
Might as well join me
if you haven't had dinner yet.

188
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:51,727
What are you doing here?

189
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:54,563
Where's Ms. Noh In-ji?

190
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:58,483
I see she's not here.

191
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:01,320
Say what you want to say.

192
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:06,908
I have a question for you.

193
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:10,162
How did you feel
when you first saw Ms. Noh In-ji?

194
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:17,919
Haven't you ever wondered
why it had to be Noh In-ji?

195
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:28,680
It can't just be a coincidence.

196
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:33,393
What are you getting at?

197
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:39,566
I didn't like those slippers.

198
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:52,371
Take them off.

199
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:01,671
You're not really wearing those, are you?

200
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:05,675
Wear these.

201
00:23:24,152 --> 00:23:27,531
Everything became clear to me
when I saw Noh In-ji's face at NM.

202
00:23:28,448 --> 00:23:30,992
I couldn't stomach
the idea of being with you,

203
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:35,831
but for the first time,
I felt I could find my way back to you.

204
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:41,128
That was the reason you picked her?

205
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:48,385
I thought I was the only one broken,
but I was wrong.

206
00:23:49,886 --> 00:23:51,888
You're the one who's truly broken.

207
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:56,560
That's why you should end
this fake marriage.

208
00:23:57,978 --> 00:24:00,272
Won't it just break us even further?

209
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:03,191
I'll be leaving now.

210
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:05,652
Enjoy your dinner, honey.

211
00:24:32,387 --> 00:24:34,598
You'll find the alimony
to your satisfaction.

212
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:36,558
We broke the contract, after all.

213
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:38,935
How about a settlement instead?

214
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:42,189
We could take you to court

215
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:45,442
for supplying drugs
and conducting illegal surveillance.

216
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:47,611
Why haven't you told him?

217
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:51,740
He didn't seem to know yet.

218
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:55,911
Because I don't know
how to break it to him yet.

219
00:24:58,246 --> 00:25:01,416
Don't get me wrong.
It wasn't out of consideration for you.

220
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:04,544
I guess
you don't want to see him get hurt.

221
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:07,255
That doesn't make you any less fake.

222
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:11,301
Aren't you here because you're worried
the fake relationship might become real?

223
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:39,371
You haven't watched soccer in a while.
Is now really the time?

224
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:43,041
If you want to watch it with me,
just say so.

225
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:46,962
Who says I do?

226
00:26:01,768 --> 00:26:03,520
I'm sorry for calling you childish.

227
00:26:04,312 --> 00:26:06,523
What about the "selfish as ever" part?

228
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:09,776
Let's call it even. You said things too.

229
00:26:11,152 --> 00:26:13,613
Didn't you tell me to go back
to my fancy house?

230
00:26:14,864 --> 00:26:16,866
Here we both are in that fancy house.

231
00:26:20,036 --> 00:26:21,371
You hold quite the grudge.

232
00:26:21,454 --> 00:26:22,956
I can recite it word for word.

233
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:26,042
No one's ever said such things to me.

234
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:32,632
You were right.

235
00:26:36,886 --> 00:26:38,888
At first, it was out of spite.

236
00:26:39,514 --> 00:26:41,016
Then it was dogged determination.

237
00:26:41,641 --> 00:26:44,060
Towards the end,
I couldn't end things alone,

238
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:46,146
so I kept watch at the house.

239
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:50,442
At first, the house was a hollow shell,

240
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,528
but later, that's what I became.

241
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:58,033
Maybe that's why I couldn't leave.

242
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:09,085
Once this marriage is over…

243
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:14,758
will you go back to him?

244
00:27:16,843 --> 00:27:18,970
I wonder
if that's what you're waiting for.

245
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:23,183
How about you?

246
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:26,770
Will you go back to Ms. Lee Seo-yeon?

247
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:48,917
You two are incompatible.

248
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:51,753
You both know you're miserable,

249
00:27:52,462 --> 00:27:53,463
but you won't admit it.

250
00:27:54,547 --> 00:27:56,007
I'm going back to him.

251
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:02,263
This NM marriage with me
is what's right for you.

252
00:28:03,556 --> 00:28:04,391
"Right for me"?

253
00:28:04,974 --> 00:28:06,226
We're both mean people.

254
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:11,231
At least see the contract through.

255
00:28:11,731 --> 00:28:13,566
It's not your fault we're ending things.

256
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:15,652
I'll explain everything to NM.

257
00:28:15,735 --> 00:28:17,320
That's not my point!

258
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:22,242
Why do you keep hurting yourself?
Why can't you see reason?

259
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:27,956
Come over here.

260
00:28:35,296 --> 00:28:36,214
Please.

261
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:32,896
I guess we should meet.

262
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:41,321
Let's eat.

263
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:02,592
I'm heading over to that house.

264
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:06,179
Will it take long?

265
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:08,348
No.

266
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:11,935
Get back safe.

267
00:30:56,646 --> 00:30:58,231
I made some soybean paste soup.

268
00:30:58,815 --> 00:30:59,649
It's ready.

269
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:01,442
Take a seat.

270
00:31:15,498 --> 00:31:16,332
Dig in.

271
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:29,721
The soup turned out quite salty.

272
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:36,895
I know you like egg rolls.

273
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:49,115
We should have some fresh kimchi too.

274
00:31:49,699 --> 00:31:50,617
Aren't you curious

275
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:54,829
as to how I've been eating?

276
00:31:58,124 --> 00:32:01,044
I should have used less paste.
It's saltier since it's homemade.

277
00:32:01,544 --> 00:32:02,587
In-ji.

278
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:04,839
Please stop doing this.

279
00:32:08,468 --> 00:32:10,762
Everything's gone wrong since I met you.

280
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:13,097
Your mother wasn't to blame.

281
00:32:13,806 --> 00:32:14,766
You were.

282
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:22,523
We were happy as we were.

283
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:28,112
We didn't need to change who I was
or gain the approval of others.

284
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:35,578
Your greed destroyed my life.

285
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:38,373
Do you still feel like blaming me?

286
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:41,626
For abandoning you here and leaving?

287
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:44,879
You're wrong.

288
00:32:47,715 --> 00:32:49,384
I wondered if I was a monster.

289
00:32:50,426 --> 00:32:53,012
On the plane,
after cutting ties with all my loved ones,

290
00:32:54,514 --> 00:32:56,432
I couldn't recognize myself anymore.

291
00:32:58,476 --> 00:33:01,270
The question I most wanted to ask you was,
"Who am I?"

292
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:06,317
But you were also the one I most feared.

293
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:09,779
I couldn't bear to face you.

294
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:13,282
I wanted to blame you for everything,

295
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:16,035
but doing so would hurt me too.

296
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:20,164
Why did you do this to me?

297
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:27,880
Why did you make it impossible
for me to face you?

298
00:33:43,062 --> 00:33:46,441
I thought I wouldn't be able to breathe
if I saw you again…

299
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:52,363
but I actually can.

300
00:33:57,118 --> 00:33:59,662
At times, I felt so sorry
that I wanted to kill myself.

301
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:03,416
At others, I hated you so much
that I wanted to kill you.

302
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:06,461
I would wake up every morning

303
00:34:07,795 --> 00:34:10,965
and pray that my existence
would be erased from the world.

304
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:16,179
Every day was a living hell,
but I stayed here alone and persevered.

305
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:20,475
"Today."

306
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:25,688
"Today's the day he'll come back to me
like nothing ever happened."

307
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:31,861
One day, two days,
a hundred days, a thousand days…

308
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:37,158
As time went by,
I started wishing for something else.

309
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:40,411
That you'd hurry back
and put an end to it.

310
00:34:41,996 --> 00:34:44,165
I couldn't put an end to it by myself,

311
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:47,085
so I wished that you'd hurry back.

312
00:34:49,128 --> 00:34:51,214
It was like wishing for a merciful death.

313
00:34:54,675 --> 00:34:55,510
But Do-ha…

314
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:00,765
it's been five years.

315
00:35:03,017 --> 00:35:06,145
How could you take so long
to show yourself?

316
00:35:10,024 --> 00:35:12,318
You should've told me something, anything.

317
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:18,699
You should have at least told me
that this marriage was over.

318
00:35:35,716 --> 00:35:36,926
I should have…

319
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:43,224
told you this five years ago.

320
00:35:46,352 --> 00:35:48,437
And I needed to hear this five years ago.

321
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:53,359
I'm sorry it took so long,

322
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:55,778
In-ji.

323
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:08,583
Thank you…

324
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:15,089
for holding on and staying alive.

325
00:36:35,151 --> 00:36:36,652
-Kick further.
-Further? Okay.

326
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:37,612
That's it.

327
00:36:39,822 --> 00:36:40,823
Wait, no!

328
00:36:44,076 --> 00:36:47,580
You're supposed to prop me up. That hurts!

329
00:36:47,663 --> 00:36:49,665
He who does the dishes is a good man.

330
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:53,377
Want me to make tofu stew
with spicy peppers?

331
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:55,713
Soft tofu stew sounds great.
Damn delicious!

332
00:36:55,796 --> 00:36:56,881
With makgeolli?

333
00:36:58,424 --> 00:36:59,717
That's it.

334
00:37:01,594 --> 00:37:03,512
Have you ever put yourself in my shoes?

335
00:37:04,096 --> 00:37:06,057
When are you going to grow up?

336
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:10,394
I felt bad for you the first few times.
I even found it endearing.

337
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:12,939
But now, it's plain annoying.
Just admit you're scared!

338
00:37:13,022 --> 00:37:13,856
You…

339
00:37:15,691 --> 00:37:17,151
you're just like your mother.

340
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:39,340
Where are you?

341
00:37:40,549 --> 00:37:41,926
I'm worried, so please hurry back.

342
00:38:19,213 --> 00:38:20,548
How did it go?

343
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:46,008
Were you so sad that it made you
burst into tears like you did?

344
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:48,844
No.

345
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:52,139
When I saw your face, I just…

346
00:39:57,436 --> 00:40:00,064
I don't know.
I guess I was glad to see you.

347
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:07,154
You must be a pervert,
sobbing because you're glad to see me.

348
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,244
I was glad to see you

349
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:15,746
cry like that.

350
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:54,452
What do you like?

351
00:40:58,706 --> 00:41:00,124
Which side dishes and stuff.

352
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:03,461
I'm not really picky.

353
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:06,714
How about music?

354
00:41:10,217 --> 00:41:12,386
Do you like film soundtracks,

355
00:41:13,345 --> 00:41:14,263
by any chance?

356
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:19,810
Do you want to come see me work?

357
00:41:23,022 --> 00:41:23,981
Sure.

358
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:26,525
Tell me when would work, and--

359
00:41:26,609 --> 00:41:27,693
Tomorrow works.

360
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:31,113
Okay.

361
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:38,496
Kids, let's eat.

362
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:41,832
Hwan, Gwan. Come on, your mom's tired.

363
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:45,336
Get your butts over here!

364
00:41:46,212 --> 00:41:47,296
Sit down and eat.

365
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:59,391
-Hey, that's mine.
-No, it's mine.

366
00:41:59,475 --> 00:42:01,602
Stay still or you'll get hurt.

367
00:42:02,811 --> 00:42:04,897
-But it's mine!
-Should I start working again?

368
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:08,901
I just don't think
this is the life I'm meant to live.

369
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:14,365
On top of all the kids' extracurriculars,
imagine hiring a nanny for school runs.

370
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:16,784
We'd be in the red for sure.

371
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:19,787
-I don't want to!
-Hurry up and hand it over.

372
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:22,206
I know what you want to say.
I hate myself too.

373
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:25,084
-Give it. That's mine!
-I said no!

374
00:42:25,167 --> 00:42:27,169
-All done. Off you go.
-Let's go!

375
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:30,297
Let's go!

376
00:42:49,858 --> 00:42:52,403
Are you crying because of what I said
about me finding a job?

377
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:56,282
Time sure flies.

378
00:42:57,283 --> 00:43:00,828
The kids' toenails used to be so soft,
but now they're so hard.

379
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:03,414
Clipping them feels completely different.

380
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:08,294
They'll be adults in no time.

381
00:43:08,377 --> 00:43:11,171
They'll be slamming doors on us
once they hit puberty.

382
00:43:13,007 --> 00:43:14,425
Here come the waterworks.

383
00:43:16,677 --> 00:43:20,347
It's all right, honey.
You have me by your side.

384
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:32,776
Let's enjoy growing old together, honey.

385
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:34,153
I love you.

386
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:35,946
Me too.

387
00:43:56,925 --> 00:43:59,094
The body's been decomposing for a while.

388
00:44:00,846 --> 00:44:04,058
They stuck a sign to the shutters
saying the owner's studying abroad.

389
00:44:04,141 --> 00:44:06,769
The nutter had the balls to kill someone
and then use the printer.

390
00:44:07,269 --> 00:44:08,479
Any security cameras?

391
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:12,232
We looked at all the footage
from the alley,

392
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:15,402
but the crazy bastard must have taken
all the pharmacy's footage.

393
00:44:16,862 --> 00:44:18,989
Her neck's been snapped. It's a clean job.

394
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:20,991
Not a single drop of blood.

395
00:44:21,075 --> 00:44:23,619
The blood we found must be the culprit's.

396
00:44:24,536 --> 00:44:25,621
Send it to forensics,

397
00:44:25,704 --> 00:44:27,998
and run the DNA results
through the database

398
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:29,208
Yes, sir.

399
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:37,966
Eom Tae-seong
has been tailing Mr. Han Jeong-won.

400
00:44:39,259 --> 00:44:41,345
They've been frequenting
the same places lately,

401
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:43,931
which isn't a good sign.

402
00:44:47,017 --> 00:44:48,018
I've notified the company.

403
00:44:50,312 --> 00:44:51,146
I understand.

404
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:52,124
Hello?

405
00:45:56,336 --> 00:45:57,171
NOH IN-JI

406
00:45:57,254 --> 00:45:58,297
She actually picked up.

407
00:46:00,716 --> 00:46:01,550
Ms. In-ji?

408
00:46:04,219 --> 00:46:05,262
Let's meet.

409
00:46:06,722 --> 00:46:07,556
I'd love that.

410
00:46:08,724 --> 00:46:09,641
When…

411
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:39,213
NOH IN-JI:
CAFE CAVIAR AT 2 P.M.

412
00:47:31,598 --> 00:47:33,141
I have a question.

413
00:47:34,268 --> 00:47:35,143
I love questions.

414
00:47:36,645 --> 00:47:40,107
Does it make you happy to obsess over me,
harass me, and spy on me?

415
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:44,862
I don't know who else to ask.

416
00:47:49,157 --> 00:47:51,952
I did some thinking
while I was in the psych ward.

417
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:56,498
"Noh In-ji could live a better life.
Why does she keep punishing herself?"

418
00:47:57,207 --> 00:48:00,419
"I should let the whole world know
about those fucked up marriages."

419
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:04,798
Once I decided to do that,
it was like a cloud had lifted.

420
00:48:04,882 --> 00:48:05,716
I felt thrilled.

421
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:10,512
Was that happiness?

422
00:48:15,893 --> 00:48:17,311
I also have a question for you.

423
00:48:18,478 --> 00:48:20,647
Your marriage contract's
in the trunk, isn't it?

424
00:48:22,316 --> 00:48:25,694
People might not believe me,
but they'll believe material proof.

425
00:48:26,445 --> 00:48:28,655
Once the press and social media
hear about this story,

426
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:30,282
it's sure to cause a stir.

427
00:48:30,365 --> 00:48:31,199
Don't you think?

428
00:48:32,784 --> 00:48:35,454
I went over to that house
because I thought it was there…

429
00:48:38,123 --> 00:48:39,124
but got stabbed

430
00:48:40,042 --> 00:48:41,251
by Seo Do-ha.

431
00:48:43,503 --> 00:48:47,049
The guy used to be a total loser,
but he's changed.

432
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:52,220
Thanks to him,
I ended up killing a random person.

433
00:48:55,974 --> 00:48:57,225
Who did you kill?

434
00:49:02,814 --> 00:49:03,941
Why do you hate me?

435
00:49:05,442 --> 00:49:06,777
Do you really have to ask?

436
00:49:11,865 --> 00:49:13,075
I think we're done here.

437
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:15,202
I have somewhere to be.

438
00:49:31,009 --> 00:49:32,010
Let's leave that out.

439
00:49:33,345 --> 00:49:34,262
This too.

440
00:49:34,763 --> 00:49:36,765
Sounds good. We can just lower this…

441
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:44,231
What?

442
00:49:47,275 --> 00:49:48,276
What's gotten into him?

443
00:49:53,907 --> 00:49:56,034
You can clock out in five.
I'll wrap up alone today.

444
00:49:57,869 --> 00:49:59,079
That track sounds great.

445
00:50:00,497 --> 00:50:03,959
-What's gotten into him?
-Maybe something good happened.

446
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,841
I'm almost at the underground parking lot.

447
00:50:12,551 --> 00:50:14,511
Wait right there. I'll be down shortly.

448
00:50:28,734 --> 00:50:30,569
What are you doing here,
Mr. Eom Tae-seong?

449
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:34,197
I never got to hear your answer.

450
00:50:38,452 --> 00:50:39,953
Why do you hate me?

451
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:46,585
You've hated me from the beginning,
before I'd even done anything.

452
00:50:46,668 --> 00:50:47,919
What I'm asking is,

453
00:50:48,754 --> 00:50:51,214
why would you hate me
from the moment you saw me?

454
00:50:52,299 --> 00:50:54,134
It wasn't like that with Han Jeong-won.

455
00:51:00,849 --> 00:51:02,267
Speaking of him,

456
00:51:03,101 --> 00:51:05,854
I wonder if you'd look my way
if I killed him too.

457
00:51:09,524 --> 00:51:10,484
Would you?

458
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:13,737
I would never let that happen.

459
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:19,826
Then tell me.

460
00:51:20,535 --> 00:51:22,662
How am I so different from Han Jeong-won?

461
00:51:23,163 --> 00:51:24,206
Let go.

462
00:51:32,714 --> 00:51:33,548
Tell me.

463
00:51:35,592 --> 00:51:36,426
Why is it that--

464
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:37,427
You bastard.

465
00:51:50,774 --> 00:51:51,608
Crazy bastard.

466
00:51:52,692 --> 00:51:53,527
Die.

467
00:51:54,653 --> 00:51:56,571
Die, you son of a bitch!

468
00:51:57,239 --> 00:51:58,323
Die!

469
00:51:58,406 --> 00:52:01,368
Stop it, Mr. Han Jeong-won.

470
00:52:02,410 --> 00:52:03,537
Mr. Han Jeong-won!

471
00:52:59,759 --> 00:53:02,596
You said you went to shooting ranges
with your father, but man!

472
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:05,849
Didn't you say he dragged you there
against your will?

473
00:53:06,516 --> 00:53:08,852
You acted
like you'd never touch a gun again.

474
00:53:08,935 --> 00:53:09,895
What's gotten into you?

475
00:53:11,479 --> 00:53:14,107
Do you still have that gun in your house?

476
00:53:17,194 --> 00:53:19,321
That thing looked really cool,
your father's gun.

477
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:22,199
You said it's not registered, right?

478
00:53:23,825 --> 00:53:24,659
Have you

479
00:53:26,077 --> 00:53:27,704
ever wanted to kill someone?

480
00:53:29,497 --> 00:53:30,332
Plenty of times.

481
00:53:30,874 --> 00:53:32,626
Sometimes, I feel like killing you.

482
00:53:36,922 --> 00:53:38,632
Is there someone you want to kill?

483
00:53:46,097 --> 00:53:49,726
CONFRONTATION
WITH DEPUTY MANAGER NOH IN-JI

484
00:53:57,067 --> 00:53:58,568
Deputy Manager Noh In-ji is here.

485
00:53:58,652 --> 00:53:59,736
Tell her to come in.

486
00:54:02,113 --> 00:54:04,199
PHYSICAL ALTERCATION
WITH CLIENT HAN JEONG-WON

487
00:54:17,545 --> 00:54:20,298
If this is about Eom Tae-seong,
we're looking for a solution.

488
00:54:21,424 --> 00:54:23,843
No. I'm here for something else.

489
00:54:26,763 --> 00:54:28,974
Once my marriage
with Mr. Han Jeong-won ends,

490
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:30,976
I will be leaving the company.

491
00:54:32,811 --> 00:54:33,687
Is this

492
00:54:34,604 --> 00:54:36,147
because of Mr. Seo Do-ha?

493
00:54:36,773 --> 00:54:37,607
No.

494
00:54:38,566 --> 00:54:40,443
This concerns my productivity
as an employee.

495
00:54:42,237 --> 00:54:44,572
I don't think I'm fit
to continue this work.

496
00:54:44,656 --> 00:54:46,032
You couldn't be more wrong.

497
00:54:46,908 --> 00:54:49,494
None of our employees
have the results you do, Ms. Noh.

498
00:54:51,955 --> 00:54:54,457
My resignation
is also best for the company.

499
00:54:55,041 --> 00:54:58,461
Eom Tae-seong may put the company at risk.

500
00:54:59,254 --> 00:55:02,215
If I stop working here,
he might let things settle.

501
00:55:02,716 --> 00:55:04,134
If that's your reason,

502
00:55:04,801 --> 00:55:06,761
we'll do everything we can to stop him.

503
00:55:06,845 --> 00:55:08,388
My mind's already made up.

504
00:55:11,182 --> 00:55:13,018
I appreciate all you've done for me.

505
00:55:35,832 --> 00:55:37,500
Fricking vending machine coffee.

506
00:55:38,585 --> 00:55:39,711
This is the stuff.

507
00:55:39,794 --> 00:55:42,422
Yirgacheffe's always been my favorite.

508
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:48,595
To think the CEO herself would come see me
over Noh In-ji's resignation.

509
00:55:51,890 --> 00:55:53,516
Why do you think she's quitting?

510
00:55:54,476 --> 00:55:56,186
Probably because of Eom Tae-seong.

511
00:55:57,437 --> 00:55:59,356
You should have killed him ages ago.

512
00:56:02,108 --> 00:56:03,068
I was only kidding.

513
00:56:03,151 --> 00:56:05,403
No need to scare me
with the silent treatment.

514
00:56:08,990 --> 00:56:11,618
This isn't her first time
dealing with Eom Tae-seong.

515
00:56:12,202 --> 00:56:13,870
I figured there was another reason.

516
00:56:13,953 --> 00:56:17,665
It seems things are completely over
between her and the owner of the house.

517
00:56:18,249 --> 00:56:21,961
Which leaves us with only one conclusion.
It's no longer strictly business for her.

518
00:56:22,837 --> 00:56:26,800
Sure, this business sets people up
with their ideal match,

519
00:56:26,883 --> 00:56:29,010
but a marriage still takes
some dedication.

520
00:56:29,594 --> 00:56:32,305
In the process,
couples may end up loathing each other,

521
00:56:32,389 --> 00:56:35,016
or they may actually develop feelings.

522
00:56:37,227 --> 00:56:41,314
Are you telling me she's doing this
over Mr. Han Jeong-won, not Eom Tae-seong?

523
00:56:41,398 --> 00:56:43,316
Want to hear it from someone

524
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:45,402
who's been married
and divorced three times?

525
00:56:46,069 --> 00:56:48,863
Married couples can endure
physical hardships.

526
00:56:48,947 --> 00:56:51,491
What they can't endure
is a loveless relationship.

527
00:56:51,991 --> 00:56:54,119
Conversely, even a fake couple

528
00:56:54,744 --> 00:56:56,413
might struggle to suppress
genuine feelings.

529
00:56:56,496 --> 00:56:57,622
After all, they are married.

530
00:56:59,999 --> 00:57:02,585
Knowing Noh In-ji,
why do you think she's doing it?

531
00:57:03,837 --> 00:57:08,133
So she's resigning because she developed
actual feelings for a client?

532
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:15,014
God, that's bitter.

533
00:58:21,623 --> 00:58:23,124
MR. KIM

534
00:58:26,294 --> 00:58:27,378
Yes, Mr. Kim.

535
00:58:52,487 --> 00:58:55,615
The CCTV installers we hired
discovered them.

536
00:58:56,866 --> 00:58:58,660
They were installed by experts.

537
00:59:00,078 --> 00:59:01,663
Shall I remove them right away?

538
00:59:34,404 --> 00:59:35,822
Come home right now.

539
00:59:37,198 --> 00:59:39,200
It appears Mr. Han Jeong-won knows
what you did.

540
00:59:54,966 --> 00:59:56,884
OPEN DOOR

541
01:00:13,276 --> 01:00:14,944
Can't you just let it slide?

542
01:00:17,405 --> 01:00:18,239
Where is it?

543
01:00:48,311 --> 01:00:51,648
RECENTLY ACCESSED
PAST SEVEN DAYS

544
01:02:05,304 --> 01:02:08,099
RECENT CALLS
NOH IN-JI

545
01:02:08,182 --> 01:02:10,268
We looked through Eom Tae-seong's gallery

546
01:02:10,852 --> 01:02:12,562
and found countless photos of you.

547
01:02:18,860 --> 01:02:20,194
Why didn't you report him?

548
01:02:24,449 --> 01:02:25,283
I did.

549
01:02:26,367 --> 01:02:27,201
Several times.

550
01:02:28,453 --> 01:02:31,914
But you wouldn't take action
unless someone had killed or been killed.

551
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:46,971
…but got stabbed

552
01:02:47,555 --> 01:02:48,890
by Seo Do-ha.

553
01:02:48,973 --> 01:02:51,434
Thanks to him,
I ended up killing a random person.

554
01:02:52,602 --> 01:02:55,938
We found traces of Eom Tae-seong's blood,
and his prints were everywhere.

555
01:02:56,689 --> 01:03:00,485
The pharmacist's murder case was closed
as we couldn't prosecute Eom Tae-seong,

556
01:03:00,985 --> 01:03:02,779
what with him dying.

557
01:03:02,862 --> 01:03:06,324
But we have a duty to find criminals,
even if they did kill a murderer.

558
01:03:10,578 --> 01:03:12,914
We traced Eom Tae-seong's movements

559
01:03:13,414 --> 01:03:15,917
and found he was involved
with many people in your circle.

560
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,960
For instance,
the break-in at Mr. Seo's home

561
01:03:18,461 --> 01:03:20,254
and the assault on Mr. Han.

562
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:24,884
And?

563
01:03:28,679 --> 01:03:31,349
I've given some thought

564
01:03:31,432 --> 01:03:33,851
to who might want Eom Tae-seong gone.

565
01:03:37,897 --> 01:03:38,773
Ms. Noh In-ji,

566
01:03:40,107 --> 01:03:41,442
where were you that day?

567
01:03:54,747 --> 01:03:55,581
At the lake.

568
01:06:13,469 --> 01:06:16,889
