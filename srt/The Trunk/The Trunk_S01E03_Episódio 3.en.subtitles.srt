1
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:33,950
THE TRUNK

2
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:37,620
I heard it's your first time.

3
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:40,498
5 YEARS AGO

4
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:42,709
How desperate must you be
to do something like this?

5
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:44,753
I'm just curious.

6
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:48,506
Isn't marriage supposed to be romantic?

7
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:51,426
Romance might be a stretch,

8
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:54,220
but there is a natural order to things.

9
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:57,640
You go through the motions,
then mate with someone at your level.

10
00:00:58,308 --> 00:01:02,187
By following the natural order,
a marriage earns society's approval.

11
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:03,229
Wouldn't you agree?

12
00:01:04,522 --> 00:01:05,774
I guess I figured,

13
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:07,734
"Fuck the natural order."

14
00:01:09,527 --> 00:01:12,614
What's so special about putting two names
on a piece of paper?

15
00:01:12,697 --> 00:01:16,409
It's actually a proclamation
of mutual distrust…

16
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:21,122
with both parties knowing
it won't last forever.

17
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:24,667
It's no more than a means
to tie each other down.

18
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:27,712
Romance?

19
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:31,591
What's romantic about a contract?

20
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:35,553
What's so romantic about a certificate?

21
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,099
None of that crap means anything.

22
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:47,107
You must have a lot of issues
with marriage.

23
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,024
No.

24
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:50,110
The idea of marriage just…

25
00:01:52,695 --> 00:01:53,571
disgusts me.

26
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:58,284
This was a bad idea.

27
00:02:00,036 --> 00:02:01,037
Let's call this off.

28
00:02:02,413 --> 00:02:05,458
I'll be dead in six months.
Four at the soonest.

29
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,425
You would be my first and last wife.

30
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:16,970
If you're okay with that…

31
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:20,473
will you marry me?

32
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:34,571
THE TRUNK

33
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:38,116
Don't you recognize me?

34
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:40,118
Of course I do.

35
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,121
How do you know me?

36
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:46,207
It's not important.

37
00:02:55,758 --> 00:02:59,679
A senior I knew had plans to study abroad
but committed suicide because of you.

38
00:03:00,763 --> 00:03:03,099
They said dying
was the only way to escape from you.

39
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,144
It sounds like I was a real bitch.

40
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:10,940
That's just how I know of you,
not necessarily how I think of you.

41
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:13,610
Meaning?

42
00:03:15,403 --> 00:03:17,989
Who knows what goes on
in the mind of someone

43
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:21,075
who's decided to disappear from the world?

44
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:25,121
Maybe they just needed an excuse.

45
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:32,587
But that doesn't mean
I'm convinced you're not a bitch.

46
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:36,591
I also remember you…

47
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:39,594
from back then, Ms. In-ji.

48
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,057
But the reason doesn't really matter,

49
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:47,936
so I'll tell you later
when I get a chance.

50
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,251
Don't get out. I was just leaving.

51
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:12,919
Were you visiting our house?

52
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:15,421
"Our house"?

53
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:19,634
It's weird hearing you call it that.

54
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:23,054
I met your wife.

55
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:25,056
Did you?

56
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:26,641
What did you think?

57
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:27,976
She just

58
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:30,895
looks like someone's wife.

59
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:34,274
So you didn't know each other
before today?

60
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:36,567
Actually,

61
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:40,405
it turns out we went to college together.

62
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:45,994
I wish I could trust you too.

63
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:48,496
So hang in there, even when it's hard.

64
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:13,938
She came because of the lights.

65
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:18,651
Ms. Lee Seo-yeon had some tea
and stayed for 20 minutes or so.

66
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:21,029
I didn't ask.

67
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:23,281
I would want to ask if I were you.

68
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:27,618
I can take you to the hospital.

69
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:30,330
My appointment's next week.
I'm going out on personal business now.

70
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:05,073
Do you still dabble in you know what?

71
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:07,742
I need an expert.

72
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:28,596
Does he beat you?

73
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:30,807
Let's cut to the chase.

74
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:32,433
Rude-ass southerner.

75
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:34,685
At least ask me how I'm doing.

76
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:37,772
I was curious how you were.

77
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:42,026
How is your new post,
Assistant Manager Yoo In-yeong?

78
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:48,950
I'm pregnant.

79
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:53,996
I like the idea of having a family.
Maybe because mine's all dead.

80
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:56,499
Do you have family?

81
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:58,960
Does your husband know?

82
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:01,421
I sure hope not.

83
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:05,258
You might be better off
without a so-called family.

84
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:07,593
Then why look for him?

85
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:11,389
Wasn't it enough to find out
he's well and didn't die a year ago?

86
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:13,933
Works for me, as long as I'm getting paid.

87
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:16,227
Do you plan on marrying him again?

88
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:20,648
Or are you going to kill him?
That I could get behind.

89
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:24,944
Where is he?

90
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:31,075
According to the broker,

91
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:33,911
he was in Prague,
and then moved to Hungary two weeks ago.

92
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:35,580
Budapest, to be exact.

93
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,626
Please keep me posted as usual.

94
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:47,133
I sometimes dream
about finding my younger sibling's corpse.

95
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:52,305
Some days, I can kind of make them out,

96
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:54,849
other days,

97
00:07:54,932 --> 00:07:57,143
they're just a bloody mess
of skin and bone.

98
00:07:58,269 --> 00:08:00,021
But the dreams give me peace of mind.

99
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:03,232
It's the what-ifs that drive us insane.

100
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:08,488
What sort of dreams do you have?

101
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:13,910
I don't have dreams.

102
00:08:26,797 --> 00:08:29,717
BUDAPEST

103
00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:25,147
I guess you've forgotten…

104
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:29,485
what day it is today.

105
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:22,163
Fuck me.

106
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:44,518
HAN JEONG-WON

107
00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:48,981
Yeah, it turns out that I had it.

108
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:51,192
I found it while I was cleaning.

109
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:53,069
It's your prized possession, after all.

110
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,575
Sure, I'll bring it then.

111
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:33,878
It doesn't hurt,

112
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,006
if that's what's bothering you.

113
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:11,999
Excuse me, coming through.

114
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:18,130
Going down.

115
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:23,636
Ignore everything else
and just look at the numbers.

116
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,974
They're just numbers.

117
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:07,638
Should we schedule Ms. Noh
to see a plastic surgeon next month?

118
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:09,390
Yes, sure.

119
00:14:09,473 --> 00:14:12,768
-When might be a good date?
-Just a moment, sorry.

120
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:17,106
WIFE

121
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:20,985
Sorry, I'll call you back later.
I'm at the hospital.

122
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:23,696
Do you need any paperwork
for insurance purposes?

123
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:26,740
-No, it's fine.
-Okay, then I'll assist you with payment.

124
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:29,743
Thank you.

125
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,966
Wait here. I'll go get your meds.

126
00:14:57,438 --> 00:15:00,065
I've seen countless people
get hurt and torn apart,

127
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:02,026
but never seen someone heal.

128
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:06,572
I don't want to see it…

129
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:12,578
but I think the stitches
will be etched in my mind if I don't.

130
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:22,171
I know you're no crybaby,
but can you at least try to whine a bit?

131
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:26,133
That might just put my mind at ease.

132
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:39,813
Are you free in two days?

133
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:45,903
If you don't have any plans,
we should get married then.

134
00:15:58,248 --> 00:16:00,501
NO RECENT MISSED CALLS

135
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:05,631
Sorry, I'll call you back later.
I'm at the hospital.

136
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:18,769
What is this mess?
Did you kids really eat all this?

137
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:22,982
Guys, didn't mommy tell you
no snacks at night?

138
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:25,109
Come out and brush your teeth.

139
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:26,485
-No messing around!
-Sucker!

140
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:28,195
-Don't mess around!
-Come here!

141
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:35,744
My mom texted yesterday.
What should we do about the rice cakes?

142
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,958
Why on earth did I ever get married?

143
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:44,128
Because I was the best of the worst

144
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:47,715
out of all the class-eight guys at W&L.

145
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:51,468
I swear I'm as stable as they come,
but somehow my life's still a mess.

146
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:55,556
You want me to buy you something?
Keep it under two million.

147
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:01,437
What's the name of Mr. Han's new wife?

148
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,064
-Why do you ask?
-I want to get to know her.

149
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:05,024
Why?

150
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:10,029
I've got nothing going for me. No career,
no inheritance, no high-salary husband.

151
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:13,615
You're a CEO with just a 5% stake,
so my connections are my only pride.

152
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:33,969
It's just standard procedure.
Per the manual.

153
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:51,111
The manual…

154
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:56,450
Hey, Yoon-a said--

155
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:59,036
Isn't it about time you got a new car?
I'll buy you one.

156
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:01,330
Just give me
30 minutes of your time tomorrow.

157
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:04,083
What is it this time?
What kind of trouble are you in?

158
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,293
I'm getting married tomorrow.

159
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:09,296
They need a witness for the ceremony.

160
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:12,883
Weren't you skipping the ceremony?
And a witness for what?

161
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:16,261
Tomorrow at 3:00.
They'll send you an invite.

162
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:17,846
Who will?

163
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:33,028
How are your wife's injuries?

164
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:36,865
She's doing better now.
She had her stitches removed.

165
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,576
Doctors say she's healing fast.

166
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:43,038
I'm not sure whether that's true
or if she's just good at masking pain.

167
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:46,041
You went with her to the hospital?

168
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:49,920
You didn't know
that we went to the hospital together?

169
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,009
Her injury was my fault.

170
00:18:58,595 --> 00:18:59,429
I'm glad.

171
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:02,599
You two seem to be bonding.

172
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:12,401
OH SE-EUN
OUR LOVER/THE ORPHAN/YOU

173
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:30,919
It's a souvenir
to remind us of our worst moment.

174
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:34,715
How does it feel seeing it again?

175
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,728
That's just cruel.

176
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:49,688
How could you…

177
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:53,275
Those pills aren't for you to take.

178
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:57,279
I want you to resist.

179
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:04,286
I'll do as you say.

180
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:08,457
I'm getting married tomorrow.

181
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:22,471
INBOX
NM: INVITATION

182
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:24,139
GROOM HAN JEONG-WON
BRIDE NOH IN-JI

183
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:29,895
AS THE WITNESS TO THIS WEDDING,
PLEASE NOTE THE FOLLOWING RULES

184
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:36,735
You call this a wedding invitation?
It's more like blackmail.

185
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:24,074
How'd I put these on back then?

186
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:41,425
I could have been undressed.

187
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:44,886
If you weren't dressed by now,
you'd be planning to bail.

188
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:48,432
The thought crossed my mind.

189
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:50,642
I had no idea I'd be doing all this again.

190
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:54,187
The ceremony is meant to take place
after a week of acclimation.

191
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,481
Ours was delayed due to the accident.

192
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:59,693
It's all in the manual.

193
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:03,196
I thought I would be spared all the pomp,
but I guess not.

194
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:21,298
You're pretty good at this.

195
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:22,841
I'm good at other things too.

196
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:29,639
My grandmother always said
that I was born with deft fingers,

197
00:22:30,974 --> 00:22:34,853
and that people with deft fingers
end up doing things they don't need to.

198
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:38,440
Apparently, they are destined
to shed a lot of tears.

199
00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:40,567
Have you?

200
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:44,446
No.

201
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,162
I was going to wear this to the funeral.

202
00:22:52,245 --> 00:22:53,997
I knew these were mourning clothes.

203
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:57,667
The only black suit in the wardrobe
of someone who never wears suits.

204
00:22:58,668 --> 00:23:01,546
I figured it'd be of comfort
to someone who wishes their father dead.

205
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:07,469
Think of it like signing
a one-year insurance contract.

206
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,764
One that can simply be terminated
for a fee.

207
00:23:13,433 --> 00:23:14,267
Insurance?

208
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:21,358
Let's go.

209
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:45,590
The space you're looking at now
is the library. So over here…

210
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:48,844
It's not too late.
Say the word, and I won't do it.

211
00:23:58,895 --> 00:24:03,442
This wedding ceremony is to reaffirm
the contract between the two of you.

212
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:10,073
This contract is confidential between NM,
Mr. Han Jeong-won, and Ms. Noh In-ji.

213
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:16,496
Legally, this marriage will leave you
with no obligations or records.

214
00:24:17,747 --> 00:24:22,294
In case of breach of contract,
both parties may face civil liability

215
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:24,921
as stated in your contract with NM.

216
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:27,674
The marriage will last a year,

217
00:24:28,258 --> 00:24:31,136
but if the two of you agree,
it can be extended.

218
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:35,932
However, if one side objects,
an extension is void,

219
00:24:36,516 --> 00:24:37,392
and from then on,

220
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:40,604
you may never contact each other again.

221
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:45,734
This marriage will begin
the moment you sign the contract.

222
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:11,176
Mr. Han Jeong-won and Mrs. Noh In-ji,

223
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:14,095
I now pronounce you husband and wife,
per the contract by NM.

224
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:18,099
I'm honored to join you both
in your marriage.

225
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:34,991
MARRIAGE AGREEMENT
GROOM HAN JEONG-WON, BRIDE NOH IN-JI

226
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:10,402
What did you do before this?

227
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:13,071
According to protocol, I can't tell you.

228
00:26:14,864 --> 00:26:15,699
Protocol?

229
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:19,369
Your legal team did seem sharp.

230
00:26:19,452 --> 00:26:22,205
They'd win a case
arguing that Messi plays for Spain.

231
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:27,460
Why do other people do this?

232
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:31,715
Did you ever ask your former husbands
why they did this?

233
00:26:35,176 --> 00:26:36,553
I've given it some thought,

234
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:40,724
and I can see how a lonely,
terminally ill patient

235
00:26:41,474 --> 00:26:42,767
might give this a go.

236
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:45,979
Still, what's the point
of a fake marriage?

237
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,941
Maybe they wish to hide their loneliness
so desperately,

238
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:52,068
they're willing to cling to a facade.

239
00:26:54,487 --> 00:26:56,948
Having company doesn't hide loneliness.

240
00:26:57,824 --> 00:26:59,826
They know, but they grow accustomed to it.

241
00:27:00,368 --> 00:27:02,871
It's like a habit,
like they're afraid to be alone.

242
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:05,957
Wasn't that why you got married?

243
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:11,463
Like a habit or separation anxiety,

244
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:15,091
fully aware of the fact
that you'd feel alone anyway.

245
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:22,432
Good night.

246
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,018
Whatever the case,

247
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:28,313
it is our first official night
as newlyweds.

248
00:27:40,283 --> 00:27:43,119
IT'S NOT TOO LATE
SAY THE WORD, AND I WON'T DO IT

249
00:30:04,385 --> 00:30:05,720
Were you drowning?

250
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:09,891
Seemed like that kind of dream.

251
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:14,020
It's the same old dream.

252
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:17,398
Don't worry.

253
00:30:19,692 --> 00:30:21,653
The tidal waves can't reach you here.

254
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:29,178
Last night, did you…

255
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:37,937
Never mind.

256
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:40,064
I think I had sleep paralysis.

257
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:44,360
If you want to know
if I was by your side last night, I was.

258
00:31:48,364 --> 00:31:50,992
The manual says
to share a room after the wedding.

259
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:54,996
Were you drowning?

260
00:31:56,497 --> 00:31:58,082
Seemed like that kind of dream.

261
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:00,710
It's the same old dream.

262
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:06,841
Don't worry.

263
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:10,929
The tidal waves can't reach you here.

264
00:32:20,521 --> 00:32:23,483
Except in special circumstances,
the couple sleeps together.

265
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:25,902
Special circumstances?

266
00:32:26,402 --> 00:32:28,988
Like diseases
classified as "highly infectious."

267
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:41,417
Why is she taking it this far?

268
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:44,379
I may need a woman, but not like this.

269
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:57,183
I'm already a train wreck.

270
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:02,230
Ask Lee Seo-yeon how broken
I need to be for her to feel satisfied.

271
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:06,317
All I asked of you
was to let a year pass by quietly.

272
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:08,069
Was that too much to ask?

273
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:10,321
What's making you so nervous?

274
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:12,615
Nervous? I just don't want to care
about any of this!

275
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:15,618
I want things to go back to how they were,
as soon as possible!

276
00:33:17,286 --> 00:33:19,163
Do you really want to go back?

277
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:21,165
Yes!

278
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:23,668
I understand.

279
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:31,009
I'll see what we can do
about our sleeping arrangement.

280
00:34:14,677 --> 00:34:16,512
-How did they do that?
-He lifted her.

281
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:20,516
-I got you.
-Yeah, you have.

282
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,727
-Turn and do that thing.
-How?

283
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:25,354
-Try to do something with your leg.
-Wait, like this?

284
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,735
Now, turn! Go on!

285
00:34:31,277 --> 00:34:34,864
-Spin around like this?
-And then spin me like this.

286
00:34:34,947 --> 00:34:36,532
-That's it, go low.
-Lower me.

287
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:38,201
-Lower me down.
-Like this?

288
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:42,246
-Come on, don't let go!
-Hold up.

289
00:34:47,376 --> 00:34:50,129
The lights shipped from Paris.
I'll replace them next week.

290
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:53,841
Congratulations on your marriage, honey.

291
00:35:15,988 --> 00:35:17,657
I'd like to inquire about some drugs.

292
00:35:18,741 --> 00:35:20,827
The contents may be different
from what's on the label.

293
00:35:21,702 --> 00:35:23,037
I'll send them via express mail.

294
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,272
What brings you here so early?

295
00:35:49,856 --> 00:35:51,732
Hasn't it been a while since you cooked?

296
00:35:52,692 --> 00:35:54,777
Is that bastard returning from the grave?

297
00:35:56,529 --> 00:35:57,697
Glare at me all you want.

298
00:35:58,197 --> 00:35:59,157
Give me some too.

299
00:36:00,449 --> 00:36:02,743
I know it's going down my own gullet,

300
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:05,913
but eating is such a chore.

301
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:09,667
Your kimchi went too sour and wilted,
so I threw it out.

302
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:12,670
I just winged this batch,
but it tastes damn good.

303
00:36:14,463 --> 00:36:16,090
I don't cook for it to be eaten.

304
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:18,801
So you make it just to throw it away?

305
00:36:18,885 --> 00:36:20,636
I don't like the house feeling empty.

306
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:22,263
Hold up.

307
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:24,599
I heard that jerk told the realtor

308
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:26,976
to leave this place alone
until you move out.

309
00:36:27,935 --> 00:36:30,730
Jesus, you guys are something else.

310
00:36:32,773 --> 00:36:33,900
Have some stew.

311
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:35,610
Why don't you eat before you go?

312
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:37,069
I'll eat at the office.

313
00:36:39,155 --> 00:36:41,240
But this baby radish kimchi is delicious.

314
00:36:57,548 --> 00:37:00,468
"She came by just nowww"? Darn typo…

315
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:02,553
And I've got red pepper powder everywhere.

316
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:07,308
We'll be blooming these flowers now,
so follow along slowly.

317
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:12,146
Just go with the flow, like this.

318
00:37:13,022 --> 00:37:16,067
Now, we're going to move
the finished flower over

319
00:37:17,526 --> 00:37:20,780
by supporting the base of the flower
with these garden shears

320
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:23,699
and removing the nail slowly.

321
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:25,743
Then you simply place it…

322
00:37:29,163 --> 00:37:30,164
wherever you'd like.

323
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:33,167
Would you like to try?

324
00:37:34,293 --> 00:37:36,045
His work is so delicate,
like a true master.

325
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:41,342
-Absolutely stunning.
-Goodness!

326
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:45,638
His makeshift methods may stir curiosity,
but they're far from traditional.

327
00:37:47,056 --> 00:37:49,016
Tradition takes time to develop, you know.

328
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:51,852
When will the lights arrive from France?

329
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:54,230
Can I come over to see them?

330
00:37:56,357 --> 00:37:58,693
They're the only set in the country,
after all.

331
00:37:59,193 --> 00:38:00,861
I'll never get another chance.

332
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:05,574
I'm not sure. It's not up to me, really.

333
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:09,078
I'll take that as a yes from you.

334
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:19,797
Thank you for the great class.
I can't wait for the next one.

335
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:21,299
-Thank you.
-Goodbye.

336
00:38:22,883 --> 00:38:26,470
I ordered some birthday rice cakes
under the name Oh Hyeon-cheol.

337
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:27,513
Right.

338
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:31,892
Please prepare them carefully.
They're for a picky bunch.

339
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,562
If anything goes wrong,
I'll be the one to blame.

340
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:36,731
Is he your husband?

341
00:38:37,857 --> 00:38:38,858
Sorry?

342
00:38:38,941 --> 00:38:40,359
I assume it's not your name.

343
00:38:41,235 --> 00:38:43,571
Right, they're for
my father-in-law's birthday.

344
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:46,407
I get it. You don't like
dealing with your in-laws.

345
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:49,577
Don't worry.

346
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:51,412
I'll make your in-laws say,

347
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:53,539
"I'm not sure about everything else, but

348
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:56,667
the rice cakes were good."

349
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:03,215
Wow.

350
00:39:19,106 --> 00:39:21,817
I had to get roped into
this 50-million-won trunk fiasco.

351
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:25,696
My gut tells me that all our hard work
on this case will get us nowhere.

352
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:29,075
The fingerprints?

353
00:39:30,117 --> 00:39:31,869
They were underwater, so it'll take time.

354
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:38,334
What is it now?

355
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:42,088
There's a lot going on here,

356
00:39:43,005 --> 00:39:44,256
but there's also nothing.

357
00:39:44,965 --> 00:39:47,051
It's too clean, as if someone's tidied up.

358
00:39:48,969 --> 00:39:49,970
What are you saying?

359
00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:53,516
I don't know, okay?

360
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:00,606
Hello?

361
00:40:02,274 --> 00:40:03,692
They found out who owns the trunk.

362
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:12,493
You must have a lot of items like this
lying around.

363
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:15,204
This costs over 50 million,
yet you had no idea it was missing.

364
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:20,418
You didn't use it yourself, did you?

365
00:40:22,962 --> 00:40:25,631
It was found with the deceased.

366
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:35,057
How do you know the owner of the trunk?

367
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:39,186
I'm her husband.

368
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,773
My wife used to use it.

369
00:40:46,485 --> 00:40:47,445
Which wife?

370
00:40:56,954 --> 00:40:59,832
I'll keep watch, so you're free to go.
It's going to get dusty.

371
00:41:19,685 --> 00:41:21,896
He seems to be looking for
a house in Budapest.

372
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:27,902
I think he plans on settling down.

373
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:40,164
I'd like to take the old lights.

374
00:41:41,123 --> 00:41:42,208
-Is that okay?
-Sure.

375
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:47,505
It's an antique piece with artistic value.
Don't you think Jeong-won…

376
00:41:49,256 --> 00:41:51,800
I mean, shouldn't you discuss it
with your husband?

377
00:41:51,884 --> 00:41:54,678
You know very well he loathes that thing.

378
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:58,349
I had been wondering
how to get rid of it anyway.

379
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:02,353
Why don't we have dinner as a group
with our spouses?

380
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:07,107
What with changing the lights
and your wedding,

381
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:08,359
a celebration is due.

382
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:10,986
Or not, if you're uncomfortable.

383
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:13,656
Of course not. Let's do it.

384
00:42:14,156 --> 00:42:15,908
How does next Wednesday sound?

385
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:18,661
Sure, sounds good to me.

386
00:42:21,413 --> 00:42:22,248
Oh my!

387
00:42:23,666 --> 00:42:25,209
Here you both are.

388
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:30,923
I've heard a lot about you
from my husband.

389
00:42:31,006 --> 00:42:32,967
I'm Kang Yoon-a.

390
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:34,802
Right.

391
00:42:43,686 --> 00:42:48,190
She seems easygoing,
classy, and not too talkative.

392
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:51,318
I was worried she might be a whack job.
Good thing she's not, right?

393
00:42:52,027 --> 00:42:54,530
Mr. Han doesn't look the type,
but he's got an eye for nice women.

394
00:42:57,491 --> 00:42:58,701
Are you doing okay?

395
00:42:59,326 --> 00:43:00,160
Of course.

396
00:43:00,786 --> 00:43:02,621
It's about time Jeong-won was happy.

397
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:16,176
We'll be having Lee Seo-yeon
and her husband over for dinner.

398
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:22,182
Are you two close?

399
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:24,727
She did help us replace the lights,

400
00:43:25,644 --> 00:43:26,604
so I agreed to it.

401
00:44:12,024 --> 00:44:14,860
I was going to sell it to a junkyard
for 3,000 won,

402
00:44:16,153 --> 00:44:18,238
but she offered to take it, so I let her.

403
00:44:18,864 --> 00:44:21,200
Why 3,000 won?
It's worth well over 30 million.

404
00:44:22,117 --> 00:44:24,703
I didn't want it to be remembered
as something of value.

405
00:44:25,204 --> 00:44:27,414
I wanted it to become junk
worth only 3,000 won,

406
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:31,543
then be torn apart and melted bit by bit
until eventually nothing remained.

407
00:44:33,379 --> 00:44:35,714
Now, annoyingly,
it will live on for years to come.

408
00:44:42,971 --> 00:44:45,516
Seriously, what did you do
before this job?

409
00:44:47,559 --> 00:44:48,602
A lot of things.

410
00:44:50,437 --> 00:44:51,730
Just tell me one.

411
00:44:53,732 --> 00:44:55,609
I once taught dancing.

412
00:44:55,693 --> 00:44:58,737
Tango, waltz, and all that jazz.

413
00:44:59,863 --> 00:45:01,281
Let me guess, milonga?

414
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:06,787
There was a USB drive
plugged into the car.

415
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:11,208
Why do you go out at dawn?

416
00:45:14,336 --> 00:45:15,295
To exercise.

417
00:45:16,505 --> 00:45:17,631
What kind of exercise?

418
00:45:21,677 --> 00:45:22,761
Kayaking.

419
00:45:24,304 --> 00:45:26,056
No one else is ever out that early,

420
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:29,143
so I feel like an island
floating alone on the lake.

421
00:45:31,687 --> 00:45:32,938
You sure get up to a lot.

422
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,694
This was the best I could do
about our sleeping arrangement.

423
00:45:39,528 --> 00:45:41,447
Think of us as peaceful islands.

424
00:45:42,906 --> 00:45:45,284
In exchange,
I'll block any tidal waves for you.

425
00:46:45,385 --> 00:46:46,720
What are you doing here alone?

426
00:46:48,847 --> 00:46:50,390
Seeing where the newlyweds sleep.

427
00:46:51,558 --> 00:46:53,268
What about it did you want to see?

428
00:46:55,729 --> 00:46:58,315
Maybe it's the diffuser,
but it smells different.

429
00:46:58,941 --> 00:47:00,025
Is it bergamot?

430
00:47:00,526 --> 00:47:01,693
I like the new lights.

431
00:47:02,694 --> 00:47:03,779
Thank you.

432
00:47:04,696 --> 00:47:06,198
Did you even get a proper look at them?

433
00:47:36,395 --> 00:47:38,564
-Doesn't all this make you uncomfortable?
-What?

434
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:40,899
A divorced couples' reunion?

435
00:47:43,277 --> 00:47:44,111
Maybe.

436
00:47:48,949 --> 00:47:50,200
Dinner's ready.

437
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:37,581
Eat up. I know you like this.

438
00:48:51,219 --> 00:48:54,890
I would never have put something like this
on the table when I lived here.

439
00:48:55,557 --> 00:48:57,351
But now that I'm a guest,
I get to try it here.

440
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:00,395
Isn't that funny?

441
00:49:01,229 --> 00:49:02,439
Please indulge yourself.

442
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:04,900
I made it because I heard you liked it.

443
00:49:08,403 --> 00:49:10,113
Do you hate tomatoes too?

444
00:49:11,114 --> 00:49:12,032
That's unexpected.

445
00:49:20,666 --> 00:49:23,877
I thought you would like them.
Aren't people mostly similar?

446
00:49:34,012 --> 00:49:35,347
You've got something here, honey.

447
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:54,157
How long have you two known Seo-yeon?

448
00:49:57,285 --> 00:49:58,912
About 30 years, I suppose.

449
00:49:58,996 --> 00:50:00,706
That sounds about right.

450
00:50:01,289 --> 00:50:02,332
Wow.

451
00:50:03,041 --> 00:50:05,460
But you were only married two years?

452
00:50:06,962 --> 00:50:09,423
I guess even 30 years together

453
00:50:10,173 --> 00:50:11,341
can't save a marriage.

454
00:50:16,346 --> 00:50:19,725
I guess that's why people say
you're meant for who you're meant for.

455
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:25,814
-Mr. Yoon Ji-o--
-Have I crossed a line?

456
00:50:26,606 --> 00:50:28,567
I'd rather not play pretend.

457
00:50:37,451 --> 00:50:39,369
How long did you date before marrying?

458
00:50:41,371 --> 00:50:42,205
Well…

459
00:50:44,207 --> 00:50:46,001
that didn't really matter to us.

460
00:50:49,838 --> 00:50:51,590
We hit it off right away.

461
00:50:53,633 --> 00:50:55,052
Wasn't it the same for you guys?

462
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:24,581
I'm handsome, aren't I?

463
00:51:25,874 --> 00:51:26,708
Young.

464
00:51:29,503 --> 00:51:30,587
And tall too.

465
00:51:32,798 --> 00:51:33,757
What are you doing?

466
00:51:35,592 --> 00:51:37,594
As in, what do I do for a living?

467
00:51:37,677 --> 00:51:39,137
What's my source of income?

468
00:51:39,221 --> 00:51:41,056
Yes, that too.

469
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:44,101
Uptight curmudgeon.

470
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:47,854
Do you love Ms. Noh In-ji?

471
00:51:52,609 --> 00:51:54,194
Why the silence?

472
00:51:57,030 --> 00:51:57,989
Just so you know,

473
00:51:59,741 --> 00:52:00,909
I love Lee Seo-yeon.

474
00:52:08,416 --> 00:52:09,751
We've had a lot of wine.

475
00:52:13,296 --> 00:52:14,464
How do you two like it?

476
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:19,052
We really get into it
after about three glasses.

477
00:52:22,013 --> 00:52:23,473
How about you two?

478
00:52:32,691 --> 00:52:33,733
We prefer beer.

479
00:52:38,321 --> 00:52:40,365
Beer? Really?

480
00:52:42,617 --> 00:52:45,787
I think they have us beat.
Beer has lower alcohol content.

481
00:52:53,336 --> 00:52:56,089
The more I look at it,
the more I prefer the old one. Don't you?

482
00:53:03,513 --> 00:53:04,347
I don't.

483
00:53:06,892 --> 00:53:08,810
That's what I've always found childish
about you.

484
00:53:09,561 --> 00:53:11,021
That's what's wrong with you.

485
00:53:11,813 --> 00:53:14,482
Holding onto the past,
unable to let go of old wounds.

486
00:53:16,193 --> 00:53:17,110
Don't you think?

487
00:53:18,361 --> 00:53:21,573
I knew I should've sold
that fucking pile of crap to a junkyard.

488
00:53:27,662 --> 00:53:29,998
Some things can never be forgotten.

489
00:53:30,081 --> 00:53:31,416
You should watch what you say.

490
00:53:37,923 --> 00:53:38,965
You took it too seriously.

491
00:53:39,049 --> 00:53:41,635
Don't you have any old wounds
you can't let go of?

492
00:53:44,721 --> 00:53:45,639
That's unexpected.

493
00:53:57,067 --> 00:53:58,026
Shall we wrap this up?

494
00:53:59,027 --> 00:54:01,863
I'm not a fan of dragging things out.

495
00:54:57,460 --> 00:55:00,880
Did you see a USB drive in my car?
I couldn't find it.

496
00:55:08,388 --> 00:55:09,597
Don't you use Bluetooth?

497
00:55:10,098 --> 00:55:12,767
I don't like leaving my name
or any kind of trail.

498
00:55:16,396 --> 00:55:17,897
Why don't you use it?

499
00:55:20,525 --> 00:55:22,527
I do, storing my work as I go along.

500
00:55:23,111 --> 00:55:25,530
Security's an issue,
and Bluetooth's a hassle.

501
00:55:27,532 --> 00:55:28,783
I'll plug yours back in.

502
00:55:30,368 --> 00:55:31,870
I listen to it out of habit.

503
00:55:34,039 --> 00:55:35,957
Do you dance to that song?

504
00:55:38,418 --> 00:55:39,252
Tango?

505
00:55:43,381 --> 00:55:45,091
You know it's hard to imagine, right?

506
00:55:45,592 --> 00:55:47,302
You seem like you'd hate
that kind of thing.

507
00:55:47,886 --> 00:55:49,929
You, dancing? I just can't see it.

508
00:55:55,852 --> 00:55:58,730
I apologize. I was being too honest.

509
00:56:01,649 --> 00:56:03,485
Too bad I can't show you.

510
00:56:03,568 --> 00:56:04,861
It would blow your mind.

511
00:56:37,018 --> 00:56:39,145
You did say you'd blow my mind,
didn't you?

512
00:57:06,423 --> 00:57:07,257
What are you…

513
00:57:07,757 --> 00:57:09,426
It takes two to tango.

514
00:57:09,509 --> 00:57:10,885
No, please, no.

515
00:57:14,431 --> 00:57:16,307
The man's right hand
rests on the woman's back,

516
00:57:18,059 --> 00:57:20,937
and his left-hand holds up her right.

517
00:57:21,604 --> 00:57:23,189
Do we really have to…

518
00:57:23,273 --> 00:57:26,443
Let's try moving our center of gravity,
one step at a time.

519
00:57:30,905 --> 00:57:35,618
You never take the steps alone.
You're meant to carry your partner over.

520
00:57:35,702 --> 00:57:38,246
Both our weights
should shift entirely to one side.

521
00:57:42,625 --> 00:57:46,212
Try stepping forward two steps
with your right foot.

522
00:57:49,549 --> 00:57:50,758
-Sorry.
-It's all right.

523
00:57:51,885 --> 00:57:56,639
Right foot forward, another step,
now your left foot.

524
00:57:58,141 --> 00:57:59,684
Step to the side with your right foot.

525
00:58:01,352 --> 00:58:03,730
Change your center of gravity,
then your right foot.

526
00:58:09,903 --> 00:58:10,737
Let's go again.
