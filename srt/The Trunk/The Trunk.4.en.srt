1
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:33,950
THE TRUNK

2
00:00:40,248 --> 00:00:44,627
5 YEARS AGO

3
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:17,160
Thanks for letting me say goodbye.

4
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:20,371
Now what would you like from me,
dear wife?

5
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:23,750
A wedding and nothing else.

6
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:34,302
Are you sure you're okay with this?

7
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:38,181
If it's what you want.

8
00:01:40,683 --> 00:01:41,893
Don't kill my mom, okay?

9
00:01:46,397 --> 00:01:48,024
So I can't put a hit out on her?

10
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:50,318
Yeah, no hits.

11
00:01:53,738 --> 00:01:54,572
Do you think

12
00:01:55,406 --> 00:01:56,491
she'll come to the ceremony?

13
00:01:57,575 --> 00:01:58,827
No.

14
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:01,871
Assuming people live to around 80…

15
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:05,834
Scratch that, we might live even longer.

16
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:07,961
Assuming we live to around 100,

17
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:13,591
don't you think you'll get tired
of spending the rest of your life with me?

18
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,302
I'll let you go when you turn 70.

19
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,390
Forty years…

20
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:24,144
And what should I do after?

21
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:27,564
You could try spending the next 30 years
with someone else.

22
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:29,649
A guy.

23
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,615
So do you think

24
00:02:39,075 --> 00:02:40,535
it'll be less lonely by then?

25
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:43,830
For people, I mean.

26
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:47,333
Have you been lonely?

27
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:50,587
A little.

28
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:54,090
Not right now, though.

29
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:00,763
The way I see it,

30
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,808
people are either lonely or evil.

31
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,519
If there's one thing

32
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:08,771
life's taught me,

33
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:13,026
it's that lonely people
are the ones who get left behind.

34
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,615
In our next lives,

35
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:21,117
let's not be born.

36
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:24,078
Let's get left behind.

37
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:30,335
I'll make sure you're not lonely.

38
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:35,340
I'll keep you safe,
so you don't have to hide anymore.

39
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:46,517
THE TRUNK

40
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:04,387
I watched a documentary
about this ethnic group called the Mosuo.

41
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,764
They live in a matriarchal society
without formal marriage.

42
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:09,267
Dating's the equivalent of marriage
for them,

43
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:11,436
and parents don't even know
if their kids are married.

44
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:16,232
If a child is born, the mother raises it,
and men raise their sisters' children.

45
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:19,360
Their village looked damn peaceful.

46
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:21,946
What are you rambling about?

47
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:25,241
You've never had to check the meter
on a taxi, have you?

48
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:27,327
I was drinking until 3:00 a.m.,

49
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,954
yet you still called me out here,
so say something.

50
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:33,166
Or at least catch us some fish
to cook some spicy stew.

51
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,711
Using a living being as bait
to catch another for sport

52
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:38,546
is cruel.

53
00:05:40,214 --> 00:05:41,507
You're cruel.

54
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:44,093
I think I want to sleep with that woman.

55
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:45,094
Which woman?

56
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:48,681
You mean your wife?

57
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,068
They're not LSD or methamphetamines.

58
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:03,821
They're zolpidem-type sleeping pills,
doxepin, benzodiazepines,

59
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:05,740
antidepressants, and anxiolytics.

60
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:07,658
There was also
some prescription melatonin.

61
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:12,914
They're all drugs you can have prescribed,
but it's rare to have so many on hand.

62
00:06:12,997 --> 00:06:14,665
Do people ever hide their drugs?

63
00:06:15,249 --> 00:06:17,377
Often, if they're addicted, yes.

64
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:20,671
Looks like it's going to rain today.

65
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:23,341
Have a nice day, Ms. Noh.

66
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:25,468
Thanks.

67
00:07:08,052 --> 00:07:09,554
It's your day off, yet you still work.

68
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:18,062
I wanted to give this to you that day,
but the timing seemed off.

69
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:20,857
You always wear the same one, so…

70
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:29,449
Need help putting it on?

71
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:34,537
I've gotten used to this one.
I'll put yours on later.

72
00:07:41,377 --> 00:07:43,212
Why'd you act that way at Mr. Han's?

73
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:46,883
Awkwardly playing house.

74
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,846
I've given it some thought.

75
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:56,058
I don't think it was because of me
or Han Jeong-won.

76
00:07:57,768 --> 00:07:59,687
Does Ms. Noh In-ji bother you?

77
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:05,776
I'm used to that house.

78
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:08,988
I wasn't playing anything.
It was out of habit.

79
00:08:09,071 --> 00:08:11,741
I guess that's one way to explain it.

80
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:16,746
I'll leave you to it.

81
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:15,096
YEONHEE UNIVERSITY

82
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:22,603
HAN JEONG-WON

83
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:01,475
I feel even more uneasy
now that he's out of sight.

84
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:04,186
He should have shown up by now.

85
00:10:06,814 --> 00:10:07,940
Eom Tae-seong, I mean.

86
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:12,945
How are things this time?
Do you like your living arrangement?

87
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,031
This type of marriage is a first for you.

88
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:17,700
He's not a terminally ill patient
whose days are numbered,

89
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,621
nor a gay guy who needs to get married
because of his parents.

90
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:24,999
He's also not depressed
and trying to kill himself every day.

91
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:28,377
He just doesn't need to be
in a contract marriage.

92
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:33,090
You're damned if they've got issues,
and damned if they don't.

93
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:35,968
He does have issues.

94
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:41,182
A drug problem, among other things.

95
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:46,228
All right, if you say so.

96
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:49,857
What do you want out of this marriage?

97
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:55,488
And what can you do for him?

98
00:10:57,281 --> 00:10:58,115
A divorce.

99
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:03,371
A perfect divorce.

100
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,335
I never thought I'd see the day.

101
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:12,380
To think you'd find a woman
who's not Lee Seo-yeon.

102
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:15,508
When you first told me
you were getting married,

103
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:16,884
I thought you were nuts.

104
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,680
But then, I was lying in bed,
and the notion kind of excited me.

105
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:23,057
You don't need to waste your energy
looking for a partner,

106
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:27,061
and you get to enjoy a no-strings marriage
with someone who's a perfect match.

107
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:30,940
To us married men, that's the dream.
I'm sure even more so for women.

108
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:34,819
No kids and no in-laws.
Just a safe, casual marriage.

109
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:36,153
It's too good to be true.

110
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:39,115
Do you really like that woman?

111
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,366
It's not like that.

112
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:43,744
- It's just…
- Just?

113
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:46,622
I've had no trouble sleeping
since she arrived.

114
00:11:47,623 --> 00:11:49,542
I sleep at night
and wake up in the morning.

115
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:52,294
I'm bothered by the changes she's made,

116
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:54,463
but more bothered with myself
for being so bothered.

117
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:58,884
So you want to do it
with a woman who bothers you.

118
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:00,761
Or maybe I just need a woman
to do it with.

119
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:04,014
You're not 15. You're over 30.
You should be able to tell the difference.

120
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:08,310
Why don't you figure out if it's a need
or if you've actually fallen for her?

121
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:09,729
I haven't fallen for anyone.

122
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:13,149
I just need a woman.

123
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:16,277
It's why you don't listen to know-it-alls
who've read just one book

124
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,611
or dated one person.

125
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:20,906
What would you know?
Lee Seo-yeon's scrambled your brain.

126
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:39,967
In-ji.

127
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:46,932
You shop here?

128
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:49,477
So do I.

129
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:59,737
Why don't you check if it's just a need
or if you've actually fallen for her?

130
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:12,958
Where are…

131
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:29,809
I'm glad I ran into you like this.

132
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:31,936
Why would you be glad to see me?

133
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:36,857
I don't have any friends in these parts.
Plus, isn't this fun?

134
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:39,610
Neither of us has exes,
and we both have partners.

135
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:43,697
Or maybe you're just glad
to run into a co-worker.

136
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:46,492
So you knew?

137
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:50,329
I saw you at the office,
Assistant Manager Yoon.

138
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:54,583
Here I was thinking only I knew.

139
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:58,087
Two husbands and two wives.

140
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:01,632
Like a game of truth
where the real and the fake intertwine.

141
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:05,553
How about we forge an alliance?

142
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:09,348
I want to see things through to the end
with Seo-yeon.

143
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:16,647
Does Ms. Lee Seo-yeon

144
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,316
frequently take medication?

145
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:21,735
Sleeping pills, for instance.

146
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,323
Are we allies, then?

147
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:36,625
Would you like to go out for dinner?

148
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:39,753
You pick the restaurant.

149
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,674
Sure.

150
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:45,593
Going on a date?

151
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,054
I should get going.

152
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:51,432
I don't know about you,

153
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,518
but I'm on your side, Ms. Noh.

154
00:14:58,814 --> 00:14:59,773
Best of luck to us.

155
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:40,439
I didn't expect you'd pick this place.

156
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:48,030
I figured it would be satisfying
to eat his favorite food in front of him.

157
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:54,453
Why are you smiling?

158
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:57,748
I'm wondering if it is just a need.

159
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,794
Do I just need it?
Is there something more to it?

160
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:03,587
If so, what?

161
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:08,092
Ignore me.

162
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:10,219
Dig in.

163
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:17,059
Isn't seaweed soup mainly for birthdays?

164
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:19,103
Why does he like it so much?

165
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:25,526
People who grew up by the seaside
cook this soup with rockfish, not beef.

166
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:27,444
Once you've had it that way,

167
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:29,863
its memory follows you
all the way to the city.

168
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:36,245
You can't replicate that childhood taste,
no matter how hard you try.

169
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:40,082
But some are beaten
for not getting it right.

170
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:52,344
We always had seaweed soup at home.

171
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:56,181
At first, I thought it was
because my father liked it.

172
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:57,850
I only found out later

173
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:03,856
that my mom had never even gotten it
after giving birth to me.

174
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:09,028
My mom never had a mom,

175
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:12,031
and that haunted her throughout her life.

176
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:26,503
The day she was beaten by my father

177
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:28,797
and taken to the hospital
with chipped teeth…

178
00:17:31,675 --> 00:17:34,553
I saw her cook seaweed soup
and eat it in the kitchen in the dark.

179
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:38,390
All over something like this.

180
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:43,687
Every time she was hurting,
and every time she was beaten,

181
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:47,900
maybe she thought it would heal her,

182
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:52,196
or maybe she believed
her fate was sealed because--

183
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,960
Because no one had ever made her
this soup.

184
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:14,468
To me, seaweed soup
is a reminder of death.

185
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:23,435
What does this mean?

186
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:25,646
It's in the manual.

187
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:29,650
Something married couples can give.

188
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:32,528
Moral support.

189
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:41,912
Think of it as me

190
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:45,040
holding down a perilla leaf for you.

191
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:58,720
Back in the day, freedom fighters had
what were called "father-killing pacts."

192
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:00,264
Have you heard of them?

193
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:03,767
They would kill each other's
traitorous, pro-Japan fathers

194
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:07,229
because they couldn't bring themselves
to do it.

195
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:10,023
A shared division of labor, if you will.

196
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:12,442
Knowing such a practice existed

197
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:15,237
is rather comforting to me.

198
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:22,911
Do you want to do it with me?

199
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:27,583
I can kill that man…

200
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,670
and you can kill my mom.

201
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:58,280
Is my father fuming?

202
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:01,033
No, I'm almost there.

203
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:02,201
I'm going in now.

204
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:03,118
Okay, see you.

205
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:05,037
Mr. Oh Hyeon-cheol?

206
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:06,663
Yes, and you are?

207
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:09,708
Your wife ordered
your father's rice cakes.

208
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,878
- We met at a Heritage Lounge gathering.
- I see, thanks.

209
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:13,921
I'm a fan of yours.

210
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:18,842
I listen to every release
from your record label.

211
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:21,094
Thank you, but I really must run.

212
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:23,972
Producer Han Jeong-won.

213
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:30,604
I've loved his work in particular.

214
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:32,898
Right.

215
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,445
- I'm with the Oh Hyeon-cheol party.
- This way.

216
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:43,033
How was your day?

217
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:50,082
Spouses often ask things like,
"What did you get up to today?"

218
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:54,169
I went fishing.

219
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:57,297
Do you like fishing?

220
00:20:58,215 --> 00:20:59,049
No.

221
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:00,968
Why not?

222
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:03,512
I have pet goldfish.
Fishing reminds me of them.

223
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:09,309
Why the look?

224
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:16,483
Don't you feel bad for your goldfish
when you grill fish?

225
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:19,528
I can stop making fish if you like.

226
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,863
You even know how to make threats.

227
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:26,618
What did you do today?

228
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:31,999
You're the one who said
spouses ask such things.

229
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:34,710
I did this and that.

230
00:21:35,585 --> 00:21:39,589
Small but important things
that aren't apparent but need to be done.

231
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:44,886
I had to run the dryer because it rained.

232
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:47,389
I'd wanted to dry our sheets in the sun.

233
00:21:52,352 --> 00:21:53,312
It's comforting.

234
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:01,153
I don't know why,
but when you say things like that…

235
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:04,656
I like the things you say sometimes.

236
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:08,243
It's not even any words in particular.
It just feels like…

237
00:22:10,245 --> 00:22:12,205
you're undoing the buttons
that were fastened wrong

238
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:15,667
and re-buttoning them correctly,
one by one.

239
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:19,212
Do you struggle with buttons?

240
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:22,132
I used to when I was younger.

241
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:25,385
Sometimes I screwed up on purpose

242
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:28,638
just to see the spark come back
to my mother's eyes.

243
00:22:30,223 --> 00:22:31,850
"Look at your shirt," she'd say.

244
00:22:35,395 --> 00:22:38,690
She'd sit down, back to her old self,
and redo my buttons one by one.

245
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:47,157
You have a way of disarming people.

246
00:22:47,657 --> 00:22:49,493
I keep sharing these silly stories.

247
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:50,994
I'm not saying that's why I…

248
00:22:52,245 --> 00:22:54,456
kissed you or anything.

249
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:18,271
So you do know how to do housework.

250
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:22,067
My father didn't like
having people in the house.

251
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:24,444
I don't want to take after him,
but I'm the same.

252
00:23:25,445 --> 00:23:27,614
I pretty much lived alone
for about ten years.

253
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:32,077
I didn't replace any furniture.
I just cleaned and organized.

254
00:23:37,457 --> 00:23:39,376
Whenever a new piece of furniture arrives,

255
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:43,380
it's like a battle,
so it takes time for me to get used to it.

256
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:47,926
You must feel the same about me.

257
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:53,098
You have a knack for housework.

258
00:23:57,561 --> 00:24:00,147
Why does your mom have to die?

259
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:05,485
It may be useful to know
if we ever decide on that labor exchange.

260
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,030
You don't have to say
if you don't want to.

261
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:11,700
My mom…

262
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:14,828
ruined my marriage

263
00:24:16,746 --> 00:24:18,540
and killed him.

264
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:04,044
You killed them?

265
00:25:06,254 --> 00:25:07,797
Holy crap!

266
00:25:08,298 --> 00:25:09,966
What are you doing here so early?

267
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:11,343
Why are you here?

268
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:14,638
It's much stranger
you're here at this hour, Ms. Do-dam.

269
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:16,097
For fuck's sake.

270
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:20,727
You try raising them, then!
Let's see how long they last.

271
00:25:21,728 --> 00:25:23,605
Try keeping them alive in this house.

272
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:27,651
With the right kind of care,
these guys can outlive dogs.

273
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,569
Don't say anything, okay?

274
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:33,114
They keep her attached to this place.

275
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:34,449
If she finds out they died,

276
00:25:35,575 --> 00:25:36,826
imagine how devastated she'd be.

277
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:39,037
It's almost like
you actually care about her.

278
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,622
Snitch, and you'll pay for it.

279
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:42,040
Okay, fine.

280
00:25:46,753 --> 00:25:49,589
The punk who owns this place
is still alive, isn't he?

281
00:25:52,008 --> 00:25:53,218
He'll be back, won't he?

282
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:56,096
Yes.

283
00:25:57,055 --> 00:25:58,223
He's alive, apparently.

284
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:02,185
We thought he was dead,
but apparently, he's still alive.

285
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:25,542
How have you been?

286
00:26:27,335 --> 00:26:29,254
So you'd rather not be
a rude-ass southerner.

287
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,341
I've been all right.

288
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:36,344
Have you eaten?

289
00:26:52,485 --> 00:26:54,654
Is your husband still against it?

290
00:26:57,741 --> 00:26:59,534
What about keeping the next one?

291
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:05,665
The gynecologist told me
that I can't have kids.

292
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:08,460
They say I was born with a weak uterus.

293
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:14,758
I've lost contact with my younger sibling.
No wonder I didn't dream of their corpse.

294
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:16,801
They're probably dead.

295
00:27:18,261 --> 00:27:19,846
Now it's just me and this baby,

296
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:22,349
truly alone in the world.

297
00:27:26,394 --> 00:27:27,646
I want this baby.

298
00:27:31,274 --> 00:27:33,068
NM won't sit idly by.

299
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:39,366
If the client doesn't want the baby,
the company has to pay an exorbitant fee.

300
00:27:41,242 --> 00:27:42,410
So before that happens…

301
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:53,421
These are the brokers who kept me updated.
He's still over there.

302
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:57,133
He worked for a small trading company
that imported and exported goods to Korea.

303
00:27:57,634 --> 00:27:59,928
Now he works as a tour guide.

304
00:28:00,887 --> 00:28:02,097
He sells fish tanks too.

305
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:04,849
Ridiculous, isn't it?

306
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:06,309
Fish tanks.

307
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:10,980
I get the feeling
that he's going to come back someday.

308
00:28:12,649 --> 00:28:14,567
Whether he'll come back to you
is another story.

309
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:23,910
Where are you headed?

310
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:29,040
Home.

311
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:50,311
Want to watch a movie together?

312
00:29:00,947 --> 00:29:01,781
Isn't this nice?

313
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:04,659
Lee Seo-yeon worked on this place.

314
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,495
How did your father's birthday go?

315
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:09,080
The rice cakes saved it.

316
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:12,459
The guy who made them seemed to know you.

317
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:13,376
Who?

318
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,587
I heard he went
to a Heritage Lounge gathering

319
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:16,713
and is a fan of yours.

320
00:29:17,213 --> 00:29:18,840
Who knew you had fans?

321
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:23,845
Sure.

322
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:29,184
Hello, Seo-yeon.

323
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:30,894
I'll be going now.

324
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:34,063
Are you here because of the remodeling?

325
00:29:35,523 --> 00:29:37,150
You seem happy about something.

326
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:46,701
Thanks.

327
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:49,662
Want to grab something to eat?
I happen to be free.

328
00:29:52,415 --> 00:29:54,125
It's okay if you have an appointment.

329
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:56,169
Sorry, but I have somewhere to be.

330
00:29:57,754 --> 00:29:59,923
How about tomorrow
at a time that works for you?

331
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:01,800
Sure, let's do that.

332
00:30:02,717 --> 00:30:03,802
All right, then.

333
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:16,105
I had to get the tickets last minute,
and this was our only option.

334
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:18,650
I like these kinds of movies.

335
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:53,142
Why aren't you watching?

336
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:57,939
Because I'm scared.

337
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:01,484
I can't stomach movies like these.

338
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:34,809
Is it very scary?

339
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:51,159
The person you have called
is currently unavailable…

340
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:53,953
HAN JEONG-WON

341
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:59,834
The person you have called
is currently unavailable…

342
00:32:21,397 --> 00:32:22,899
Don't horror movies scare you?

343
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:25,401
They do.

344
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:29,364
You sure didn't look scared.

345
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:33,910
In a way, horror movies can be comforting.

346
00:32:34,869 --> 00:32:36,329
It's a relief knowing

347
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:40,416
that my life is safer
than what happens in those movies.

348
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:44,545
I hear that's why
people watch horror movies.

349
00:32:47,256 --> 00:32:49,300
Is there a reason
you need to feel that way?

350
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:52,512
At times, yes.

351
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:56,432
We have that in common.

352
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:03,064
I'm glad you asked me to a movie.

353
00:33:03,773 --> 00:33:05,400
I liked the choice of movie too.

354
00:33:12,198 --> 00:33:14,242
I guess today was one of those days
you needed relief.

355
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:18,079
A little.

356
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:20,999
Why?

357
00:33:23,459 --> 00:33:25,670
You know that man
my mom supposedly killed?

358
00:33:27,213 --> 00:33:28,214
There's a chance

359
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:32,051
I'll be meeting him soon.

360
00:33:41,477 --> 00:33:42,645
I'm not sure

361
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:45,857
if this is the right time to say this…

362
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:54,323
but I think I want to sleep with you.

363
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:00,913
I wish I could sugarcoat it,

364
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:03,499
but that would sound too contrived.

365
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:08,713
I'm telling you this
instead of holding it in…

366
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:13,968
because I'm worried nothing will happen
if I don't tell you now.

367
00:34:15,678 --> 00:34:18,681
I'm always subtracting things in life.

368
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:20,767
I've subtracted and subtracted,

369
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:23,978
and finally ended up
with a rather simple equation…

370
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:27,523
but I can't figure out where you fit in.

371
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:33,154
I can't tell if I want to sleep with you…

372
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:38,409
simply because you're a woman,
or because I like you.

373
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:41,704
I hope…

374
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:46,751
it's simply because you're a woman.

375
00:34:55,885 --> 00:34:57,053
I'll keep that in mind.

376
00:35:24,747 --> 00:35:27,708
WIFE

377
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:51,357
Where's the whiskey?

378
00:36:10,042 --> 00:36:11,127
Drink it slowly.

379
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:16,048
Pour me another.

380
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:18,759
I found it for you. Pour it yourself!

381
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:20,094
You do it!

382
00:36:25,933 --> 00:36:29,145
I should have at least one person
I can control however I'd like.

383
00:36:30,396 --> 00:36:31,480
That person's you.

384
00:36:36,402 --> 00:36:38,362
Don't you care who I am,

385
00:36:39,405 --> 00:36:41,199
or what I used to do before this?

386
00:36:41,782 --> 00:36:43,534
None of that matters to me.

387
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,370
Just because I like you
doesn't mean I'm yours.

388
00:36:48,581 --> 00:36:49,415
On the contrary,

389
00:36:50,499 --> 00:36:51,709
you are mine.

390
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:54,128
At least for a year.

391
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:06,891
Stop drinking.
You look pathetic enough already.

392
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:24,200
Sir.

393
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:26,786
They've identified the body.

394
00:37:27,828 --> 00:37:28,663
Eom Tae-seong?

395
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:31,499
Eom Tae-seong, 36-year-old male.

396
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:34,168
History of mental illness
and past hospitalizations.

397
00:37:35,461 --> 00:37:38,214
The fatal wound was to his chest,
and he also has a leg wound.

398
00:37:45,304 --> 00:37:46,138
Oh dear.

399
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:49,892
Am I going to have to buy a new batch?

400
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:52,728
They don't look so good.

401
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:16,020
How's he connected to the trunk's owner?

402
00:39:17,063 --> 00:39:19,148
He isn't.
They didn't live anywhere near each other.

403
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:22,068
So it was a simple robbery?

404
00:39:22,735 --> 00:39:24,236
That's what it looks like.

405
00:39:24,987 --> 00:39:26,447
Why would a thief steal a trunk,

406
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:28,991
then get on a boat
in the middle of the night?

407
00:39:29,075 --> 00:39:30,659
Taxis and buses are everywhere.

408
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,703
Maybe it was to avoid cameras.

409
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:35,331
The CCTV wires were cut, remember?

410
00:39:35,414 --> 00:39:37,375
The dead guy might not have known that.

411
00:39:39,001 --> 00:39:41,462
Did you find any signs
boats were used there?

412
00:39:41,545 --> 00:39:43,339
Did anyone hear any engine sounds?

413
00:39:43,422 --> 00:39:45,591
We're still questioning people, but no.

414
00:39:47,343 --> 00:39:50,221
Our victim had
an impressive criminal record.

415
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:53,349
Like what? What's the most recent offense?

416
00:39:54,141 --> 00:39:54,975
Stalking.

417
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:59,313
He was arrested for repeated stalking,
but his sentence was reduced.

418
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:03,359
Before that, he was fined and served time
for stalking. He's a seven-time offender.

419
00:40:03,442 --> 00:40:04,527
Who was he stalking?

420
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:13,077
What is it? Just tell me.

421
00:40:13,869 --> 00:40:17,289
It's Mr. Han Jeong-won's wife.
Why's her name here?

422
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:18,916
Ms. Lee Seo-yeon?

423
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:22,795
No, not the ex-wife. The other one.

424
00:40:22,878 --> 00:40:24,755
His common-law wife, Ms. Noh In-ji.

425
00:40:25,464 --> 00:40:28,050
Contact Ms. Noh In-ji,
and get me Mr. Han's address.

426
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:20,811
- Do you have a Heritage Lounge gathering?
- Yes.

427
00:41:23,022 --> 00:41:23,856
See you, then.

428
00:41:32,364 --> 00:41:33,908
I only make mistakes when you're around.

429
00:41:34,783 --> 00:41:37,828
I don't let my guard down
around anyone else.

430
00:41:46,629 --> 00:41:47,546
Have a good time.

431
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:51,842
Try to behave.

432
00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:55,095
Watch out for cars.

433
00:41:58,098 --> 00:41:59,099
And hurry back.

434
00:42:19,912 --> 00:42:23,082
I just got this mugwort tea,
and I wanted to show it off.

435
00:42:28,754 --> 00:42:30,631
It's so good. Don't you agree?

436
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:32,174
It sure is.

437
00:42:33,342 --> 00:42:35,594
I heard you had a gathering
at Jeong-won's house.

438
00:42:36,845 --> 00:42:38,013
That's right.

439
00:42:38,097 --> 00:42:41,141
The ex-husband, current husband,
ex-wife, and current wife were all there?

440
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:45,312
Why didn't you invite us
to such a special occasion?

441
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:51,360
We had a light meal, then called it a day.

442
00:42:51,443 --> 00:42:53,195
It's nice you're all getting along.

443
00:42:55,614 --> 00:42:57,575
Ma'am, will someone else be joining us?

444
00:42:58,534 --> 00:42:59,743
I asked Ms. In-ji to join us.

445
00:43:01,203 --> 00:43:04,665
I was supposed to meet her this afternoon,
but I had to reschedule.

446
00:43:05,374 --> 00:43:07,585
You're all acquainted,
so I thought it'd be fine.

447
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:11,130
If it makes you uncomfortable,
I can set up a separate meeting.

448
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:13,257
I'm okay with it.

449
00:43:13,966 --> 00:43:15,301
You don't mind, do you?

450
00:43:15,801 --> 00:43:17,928
I mean,
you've already had dinner together.

451
00:43:39,366 --> 00:43:42,119
Ma'am, your guest is here.

452
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:49,293
You're here.

453
00:43:52,796 --> 00:43:53,714
Hello.

454
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:56,258
Apologies.
I already had an appointment with them.

455
00:43:56,925 --> 00:43:59,428
And I thought it might be nice
to meet everyone all at once.

456
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:01,597
Would you be okay with that?

457
00:44:04,558 --> 00:44:05,392
Of course.

458
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:22,951
I thought we might enjoy some tea.

459
00:44:23,702 --> 00:44:25,829
It's been a while, Ms. In-ji.
I'm Kang Yoon-a.

460
00:44:26,872 --> 00:44:28,290
Of course, I remember you.

461
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:34,421
How have you been?

462
00:44:35,964 --> 00:44:39,009
Sorry for not being in touch
since you had us over. Is Jeong-won…

463
00:44:43,472 --> 00:44:45,099
Is Mr. Han also doing well?

464
00:44:46,642 --> 00:44:47,476
He is.

465
00:44:47,559 --> 00:44:49,770
And is your husband doing well?

466
00:44:56,402 --> 00:44:58,696
Were you with him yesterday by any chance?

467
00:44:59,738 --> 00:45:03,534
I needed to discuss soundproofing material
for his studio, but I couldn't reach him.

468
00:45:04,618 --> 00:45:08,831
He asked for a specific one,
but there are many with the same name.

469
00:45:09,456 --> 00:45:11,750
It's probably because
we were at the movies yesterday.

470
00:45:12,876 --> 00:45:14,628
His phone must have been on silent.

471
00:45:16,046 --> 00:45:16,880
I see.

472
00:45:25,639 --> 00:45:27,433
What kind of tea do you like?

473
00:45:27,516 --> 00:45:31,311
We were having some mugwort tea
that I just got, but there are others too.

474
00:45:32,604 --> 00:45:33,939
How about raspberry tea?

475
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:37,192
I tried it on my last visit,
and it was great.

476
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:40,362
I think it would suit Ms. In-ji.

477
00:45:44,324 --> 00:45:45,200
Would that be okay?

478
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:48,787
Yes.

479
00:46:07,097 --> 00:46:08,182
How is it?

480
00:46:10,893 --> 00:46:13,061
I hope you like it,
even though I recommended it.

481
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:15,814
I like it.

482
00:46:17,858 --> 00:46:18,942
I like berries.

483
00:46:25,908 --> 00:46:27,743
By the way, what are beets good for?

484
00:46:29,495 --> 00:46:32,372
Right, I heard that beets
are so good for you.

485
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:35,959
They're great to drink in the morning.

486
00:46:36,585 --> 00:46:37,544
I see.

487
00:46:39,379 --> 00:46:40,881
I've always wondered…

488
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:45,844
why people drink that stuff.

489
00:46:58,774 --> 00:47:02,277
Why doesn't Ms. In-ji join us
at the Heritage Lounge gatherings?

490
00:47:03,195 --> 00:47:06,323
I would love that.
She's Jeong-won's wife, after all.

491
00:47:09,993 --> 00:47:10,828
Of course.

492
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:15,624
I'm all for it,

493
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:18,085
if you're worried what I might think.

494
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:23,006
I see.

495
00:47:24,508 --> 00:47:25,759
I won't worry, then.

496
00:47:38,063 --> 00:47:39,231
Where did you park?

497
00:47:39,898 --> 00:47:41,650
A public parking lot over there.

498
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:44,820
Park on the other side next time.
It's easier.

499
00:47:46,071 --> 00:47:46,905
How about you?

500
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:50,951
I have another class this afternoon
since the kids will be home late.

501
00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:52,744
In that case,

502
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:54,872
it was nice seeing you.

503
00:47:56,081 --> 00:47:57,165
Likewise.

504
00:48:12,598 --> 00:48:14,308
Jesus Christ, that was exhausting.

505
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:16,768
Holy hell.

506
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:02,105
Are you all right?
A cat came out of nowhere.

507
00:49:09,071 --> 00:49:10,572
We'll need to tow your car.

508
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:21,416
I've never caused an accident like this,
even when I was a new driver.

509
00:49:21,917 --> 00:49:23,669
I'll make sure the car is repaired.

510
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:27,631
I'll ask Mr. Han to handle it.

511
00:49:27,714 --> 00:49:31,259
I know, but I'll do it myself.
It was my fault.

512
00:49:31,843 --> 00:49:33,637
Let's keep this a secret.

513
00:49:34,721 --> 00:49:35,555
A secret?

514
00:49:40,394 --> 00:49:41,436
You don't like secrets?

515
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:45,315
I just don't see
why it should be a secret.

516
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:49,861
So you're not a fan of secrets.

517
00:49:50,612 --> 00:49:53,198
Fine, then. Why hide something like this?

518
00:49:55,075 --> 00:49:58,370
But aren't some things better kept hidden?

519
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:03,917
For instance,
the fact that you and Jeong-won

520
00:50:05,252 --> 00:50:06,878
are in a temporary marriage.

521
00:50:12,884 --> 00:50:14,136
You don't seem surprised.

522
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:18,140
I was told the ex-wife
was the one who requested it from NM.

523
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:20,267
You're missing the point.

524
00:50:20,809 --> 00:50:24,438
The point is,
I'm the one who chose you, Ms. Noh In-ji.

525
00:50:28,608 --> 00:50:31,778
I was told there was no chance
you two would ever match,

526
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:33,155
so I figured it'd never happen.

527
00:50:34,406 --> 00:50:37,075
But your decision to take the job
has made things fun for me.

528
00:50:47,085 --> 00:50:49,337
You're the one who picked me?

529
00:50:51,131 --> 00:50:52,132
That's right.

530
00:50:53,383 --> 00:50:55,969
Why go to such lengths
to torment Mr. Han Jeong-won?

531
00:51:08,523 --> 00:51:11,109
Why go to such lengths
to torment Mr. Han Jeong-won?

532
00:51:12,486 --> 00:51:14,821
Do you know the fable
of the scorpion and the frog?

533
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:17,365
After stinging the frog
that saves its life,

534
00:51:17,949 --> 00:51:19,701
the scorpion explains
it couldn't help itself.

535
00:51:19,785 --> 00:51:20,869
It's just in its nature.

536
00:51:21,995 --> 00:51:24,623
Everyone's got their own point of view.

537
00:51:27,876 --> 00:51:30,921
You seem to be
a very diligent person, Ms. In-ji.

538
00:51:31,004 --> 00:51:34,049
You prepare his breakfast
and even debone his fish.

539
00:51:34,549 --> 00:51:38,470
Thank you for taking care of Jeong-won
in ways I never could have imagined.

540
00:51:39,471 --> 00:51:41,890
Please be happy for this one year.

541
00:51:42,474 --> 00:51:45,977
I may be punishing Jeong-won,
but I'm also giving him some time off.

542
00:51:49,356 --> 00:51:51,191
By the way, what are beets good for?

543
00:51:55,612 --> 00:51:58,865
The point is,
I'm the one who chose you, Ms. Noh In-ji.

544
00:53:24,618 --> 00:53:25,452
Are you awake?

545
00:53:27,746 --> 00:53:29,956
I moved you
because you seemed uncomfortable.

546
00:53:34,127 --> 00:53:35,629
Are you done subtracting?

547
00:53:37,547 --> 00:53:38,673
I still don't have an answer.

548
00:53:40,967 --> 00:53:43,470
Never mind. I was talking nonsense.

549
00:53:51,895 --> 00:53:53,063
I'll keep that in mind.

550
00:57:33,408 --> 00:57:36,619
