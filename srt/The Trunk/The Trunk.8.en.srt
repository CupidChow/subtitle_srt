1
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:33,950
THE TRUNK

2
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:06,107
The person you are calling
is currently unavailable. Please leave…

3
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:11,821
At least come up with a reasonable excuse
before you go!

4
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:14,157
Otherwise, it's all over.

5
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:15,867
Move aside.

6
00:01:16,993 --> 00:01:19,329
I don't have time
to talk to a nobody like you.

7
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:40,637
Just say something.

8
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,056
Whether it's an excuse or a confession.

9
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:46,351
Is that what she told you?

10
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:50,313
That I had cameras installed?

11
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:54,943
She's right. I did.

12
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:58,571
Am I not allowed
to watch you go about your day?

13
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:02,116
I would've gone crazy otherwise.

14
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:05,119
I had to see for myself
that you still longed for me,

15
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:06,496
even with her by your side.

16
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:10,750
That was the only way
I could think of taking you back.

17
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:19,259
Are you telling me you did this

18
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:22,220
so you could come back to me?

19
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:26,349
As I was entering the operating room…

20
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:30,395
you begged them to save the baby over me.

21
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:33,606
How could you do that?

22
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:36,818
How could Han Jeong-won do that to me?

23
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,405
I saw you step into the road that day.

24
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:44,617
I was angry
and blamed you for what happened.

25
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:48,204
I pitied

26
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:50,415
our baby.

27
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:57,463
I was trying to die with it.

28
00:04:58,756 --> 00:05:01,676
After I got pregnant,
every day was a living hell.

29
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:05,930
It felt like I'd become
the most useless person on earth.

30
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:10,435
I was withering away,
dreading having to give birth,

31
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:11,352
but you!

32
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:15,857
You seemed thrilled,
like the baby breathed new life into you.

33
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,651
Do you know how it feels

34
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:20,862
to be reduced to nothing more

35
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:22,989
than wrapping paper?

36
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:24,949
You should have told me!

37
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,285
You should have told me you weren't ready.

38
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:30,913
And have to bear your disappointed face?

39
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,959
Apparently, mothers put
their babies' safety first.

40
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:37,670
I was disgusted with myself too.

41
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:42,717
But I can't change
my lack of maternal instincts.

42
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:56,689
I'm to blame for not realizing sooner
how much pain you were in.

43
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:01,027
I was the fool, the idiot,
and the son of a bitch.

44
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:03,154
That's how I found closure.

45
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:07,867
I thought we could move past all this
if we just got together again.

46
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:11,037
But how could you

47
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:14,540
do exactly what my father did to me?

48
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:18,461
I was scared. What else could I do?

49
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:23,424
I had no other way to hold on to you.

50
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:26,719
Jeong-won.

51
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:29,847
We're accomplices, remember?

52
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:32,892
I killed the baby,

53
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:34,852
and you killed your mother.

54
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:39,107
If that makes us sinners,
we can atone together.

55
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:41,484
You and I, together.

56
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:52,745
You're insane.

57
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:55,957
I'll atone for my sins.

58
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:00,628
But I won't be doing so by your side.

59
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:28,216
Should we go on a trip?

60
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:37,618
Why didn't you tell me
about the hidden camera?

61
00:09:41,038 --> 00:09:43,291
I didn't know how.

62
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:46,711
I should have handled it
before you found out.

63
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:50,339
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

64
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:52,508
That sounds like an excuse.

65
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:57,305
I bet you just turned a blind eye
to avoid problems in this marriage.

66
00:09:58,347 --> 00:09:59,890
I didn't turn a blind eye.

67
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:04,729
I grabbed Ms. Lee Seo-yeon by the hair
and even beat her up a little.

68
00:10:05,813 --> 00:10:07,690
You hit Lee Seo-yeon?

69
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:09,275
Almost killed her.

70
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:12,236
Those blue pills taped to that LP…

71
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:15,531
I found out what they were.

72
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:18,367
And before I knew it, I was furious.

73
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:22,663
If I'd put my mind to it,
I could have broken a rib or two.

74
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:25,958
Didn't I mention that I learned jujitsu?

75
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:29,920
I wish I'd been there to see it.

76
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:33,215
Whose side would you have taken?

77
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,159
You actually hit Lee Seo-yeon?

78
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:04,997
You seriously pulled out her hair?

79
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:33,859
It's a family.

80
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:46,706
Let's get groceries together sometime.

81
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:50,418
We'll grab beer
and ingredients for a few side dishes.

82
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:52,586
We'll push the cart together,

83
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,047
and say things like,

84
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:57,717
"That's too much."
"That milk tastes better."

85
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:02,805
What's your favorite dish?

86
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:07,768
I'd like to cook it for you.

87
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,737
How long will you live in that house?

88
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:21,449
If I were you…

89
00:12:28,205 --> 00:12:29,039
Let's get going.

90
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:40,384
What was that? "If I were you," what?

91
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:45,556
That's an odd habit,
bailing before the punchline.

92
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:48,851
What is it?

93
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:52,313
Tell me.

94
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:38,002
Your hands are cold. Just hold on.

95
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:43,966
I recognized you from the start.

96
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:48,178
I'm Mr. Han Jeong-won's wife.

97
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:58,355
All right, look this way, please.

98
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:00,941
One, two…

99
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:05,404
At the columbarium,
and then the graduation ceremony…

100
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:09,825
It was a pretty rough day,

101
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:15,372
but it felt like you were the one person
in the universe who could understand me.

102
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:18,834
Had I gotten to know you back then…

103
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:24,548
I wonder how things might have been
if we'd met sooner.

104
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:32,640
It's possible that our relationship
might not have lasted long.

105
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:34,600
But…

106
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:42,191
I think I'd have recognized you
even if I'd passed you by a hundred times.

107
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,326
I really like you.

108
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:55,162
I want to be with you all the time.

109
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:14,890
Let's get divorced.

110
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,271
I brought you here to end things.

111
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:27,277
Did I do something wrong?

112
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:29,780
Tell me what the issue is.

113
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:33,575
This marriage is a failed marriage.

114
00:16:35,744 --> 00:16:37,955
It's my fault. I crossed the line.

115
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:44,169
I no longer have a reason
to keep doing this, so

116
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:46,714
I intend to stop.

117
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,262
Let's stop with the lies.

118
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:57,766
Acting like you're cold and bulletproof,
and that damn manual of yours.

119
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:01,562
Deep down, haven't you longed
for something to hold on to?

120
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:05,899
Isn't that why you clung
to these marriages?

121
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:07,943
So you could live?

122
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:11,280
Just admit that you and I
are both fragile, broken wrecks.

123
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:15,242
Stop talking about goddamn lines…

124
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:22,291
and just admit the truth.

125
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:28,297
Admit that you've fallen for me too.

126
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,644
I may have said I crossed a line,

127
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:47,274
but don't take that to mean
you're someone special to me.

128
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:56,909
This marriage is over, Mr. Han Jeong-won.

129
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:35,864
I wonder how things might have been
if we'd met sooner.

130
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:39,409
Had I gotten to know you back then…

131
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:44,748
I think I'd have recognized you
even if I'd passed you by a hundred times.

132
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:50,504
Come to think of it, you have a knack
for making those around you miserable.

133
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:55,217
I wonder if you'd look my way
if I killed Han Jeong-won too.

134
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:57,010
Why haven't you told him?

135
00:18:57,719 --> 00:19:00,639
Don't get me wrong.
It wasn't out of consideration for you.

136
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:03,225
I guess
you don't want to see him get hurt.

137
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:06,687
That doesn't make you any less fake.

138
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:32,379
Are you really giving me this?
Why are you quitting?

139
00:19:33,046 --> 00:19:35,674
Thank you for always opening early for me.

140
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:38,427
Feel free to come back whenever.
Maybe when it gets warmer.

141
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:40,137
No.

142
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:42,848
I probably won't be back.

143
00:19:57,988 --> 00:20:00,449
Are you in there? Ms. Noh In-ji.

144
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:02,075
Ms. Noh In-ji!

145
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:04,494
What a ruckus.

146
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:07,497
Her latest dispatch?

147
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:18,592
Hold this.

148
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:28,060
Come on in.

149
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,442
You can keep your shoes on.

150
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:00,509
Thank you.

151
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:04,846
You look decent.

152
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:10,811
You don't know who I am, so why would you…

153
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:14,398
You must have come all the way here
because you miss her.

154
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:20,112
Where is Ms. In-ji?

155
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:23,699
You should know, not me.

156
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:25,909
Aren't you guys married?

157
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,870
I'm sure she's somewhere
worrying about you too.

158
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:35,585
Find her yourself now that things are over
with the guy who owns this place.

159
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:40,173
Thanks for the drink.

160
00:21:58,984 --> 00:21:59,943
How adorable.

161
00:22:01,236 --> 00:22:03,447
- Could we pick up the pace a bit?
- Of course.

162
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:06,325
- Please get rid of the chandelier quickly.
- Yes, of course.

163
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:08,869
- Thank you for your work.
- I'll get that done now.

164
00:22:49,951 --> 00:22:53,830
She said she's quitting
and even gave me her paddles.

165
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,960
Could you please call me
if she ever comes back?

166
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,385
Sure.

167
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:28,573
NM LEE SEON

168
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:31,618
Hello?

169
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:32,994
This is Lee Seon.

170
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:36,039
I'm sorry your contract
was unexpectedly cut short.

171
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:41,670
We're willing to pay a penalty
for the breach at your request.

172
00:23:42,462 --> 00:23:45,090
No, I have no intention of doing that.

173
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:48,969
Please just make sure
Ms. Noh In-ji comes to no harm.

174
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:52,806
Okay. I'll make sure of that.

175
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:57,018
I still had things to say to her.

176
00:23:57,936 --> 00:24:01,106
There's so much I don't know.
If there's any way to contact her…

177
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,444
please tell me.

178
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:09,531
Now that the contract is terminated,

179
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:12,075
I'm afraid I can't give you
any more information.

180
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:13,577
I'm sorry.

181
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:37,851
He won't be seeking any damages
for breach of contract,

182
00:24:38,351 --> 00:24:39,519
which is a relief.

183
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:41,730
Please protect Mr. Han Jeong-won.

184
00:24:43,356 --> 00:24:47,402
Even if it goes against
what's best for NM.

185
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:50,447
You two sure are strange.

186
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:54,534
The contract expired,
yet you still try to protect each other.

187
00:24:58,747 --> 00:24:59,581
I'll be off now.

188
00:25:01,374 --> 00:25:03,251
Around two years into my marriage,

189
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:06,338
I almost killed my husband.

190
00:25:11,384 --> 00:25:15,305
Marriages are purer
when they're a business transaction.

191
00:25:18,808 --> 00:25:22,020
Do you love Mr. Han Jeong-won?

192
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:25,524
Are you scared?

193
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:29,194
So much so
that you have to end things so abruptly?

194
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,471
Seeing you here really makes it feel
like we're coworkers.

195
00:25:56,972 --> 00:26:00,100
Want to join me for a small farewell party
for us failed exes?

196
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:04,896
I happened to like my marriage.

197
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:08,316
Thanks to you,
it's become a blemish on my career.

198
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:10,151
Even the CEO wants to see me.

199
00:26:34,217 --> 00:26:35,385
Hello?

200
00:26:35,468 --> 00:26:37,846
Finally. Why did you have
your phone turned off?

201
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:45,645
This thing's harder to open
than I thought.

202
00:26:46,396 --> 00:26:49,941
It has a double lock,
so I need two sets of combinations.

203
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:51,776
It must be quite pricey,

204
00:26:53,528 --> 00:26:54,362
this trunk.

205
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,324
I got my hands on it,

206
00:26:58,074 --> 00:26:59,743
but I can't seem to open it.

207
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:02,245
Mr. Eom Tae-seong.

208
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:06,082
Did you take my trunk?

209
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,335
I guess I did.

210
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:11,004
But what to do?

211
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:16,593
Should I expose the contract in this trunk
to the world…

212
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:20,263
or kill Han Jeong-won first?

213
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:22,849
Option one or two. Take your pick.

214
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:25,685
My contract's over.

215
00:27:26,686 --> 00:27:28,813
I have nothing to do with him now.

216
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:30,315
Why?

217
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:32,025
Was it because of me?

218
00:27:36,946 --> 00:27:39,366
I think I'll kill Han Jeong-won first.

219
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:43,703
I told you that the contract's over.

220
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:47,040
It's not over yet. This never happened
in any of your other marriages.

221
00:27:47,123 --> 00:27:49,584
I've seen all your marriages,
dutiful yet without love.

222
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:52,295
Things were going well.
You kept things professional!

223
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:58,301
That's why I'm pissed off at Han Jeong-won
and that fucked up company of yours!

224
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:02,931
It seems that company's trying
to get me committed again,

225
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:05,016
or maybe they'll just kill me this time.

226
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:08,645
Now it's come to this.

227
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:12,691
Don't you think I need
a little insurance for myself?

228
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:16,444
Let's meet.
I'll tell you the lock combinations.

229
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:23,243
Where should we meet this time?

230
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,486
Seo-yeon.

231
00:28:58,570 --> 00:28:59,571
Lee Seo-yeon!

232
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:04,743
Gastric lavage.
Run a blood test, and call the police.

233
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:06,786
Wake up, Lee Seo-yeon.

234
00:29:07,328 --> 00:29:10,206
Wake up, Lee Seo-yeon! Seo-yeon, please.

235
00:29:18,715 --> 00:29:20,008
So it's come to this.

236
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:23,970
Are you happy now?

237
00:29:27,515 --> 00:29:29,684
She's always been a ticking time bomb.

238
00:29:33,646 --> 00:29:35,231
She wants to go home with you.

239
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:41,571
I'll pretend I didn't hear that.

240
00:29:41,654 --> 00:29:42,781
If I take her with me,

241
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:45,325
she could OD and end up back here
to prove a point to you.

242
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:49,704
Would you be okay with that?

243
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,931
I know you won't listen
if I try to stop you…

244
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:13,144
so go ahead and see it through to the end.

245
00:30:14,729 --> 00:30:15,563
I'm sorry.

246
00:30:20,109 --> 00:30:22,862
Don't call me. I'm going to be busy today.

247
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:02,235
I thought I'd be comfortable here.

248
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:04,445
You can use the first-floor bedroom.

249
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:12,370
Acting like a child
will only wear you down.

250
00:31:12,453 --> 00:31:13,538
We're even, remember?

251
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:21,421
I let you back into this house
so you could have some time.

252
00:31:23,339 --> 00:31:25,091
Time to face reality.

253
00:31:25,633 --> 00:31:28,094
I wondered why I couldn't leave you,

254
00:31:28,177 --> 00:31:30,638
but I've come to realize
it's because I pitied you.

255
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:33,975
Seo-yeon,

256
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:37,103
we can never go back
to the way things were.

257
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:39,063
Neither of us.

258
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:16,434
Are you really going?
What will you do all by yourself?

259
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:19,228
I'll head over right now.
Tell me where you are.

260
00:32:20,688 --> 00:32:24,359
Si-jeong, I think I was the one
who did everything wrong.

261
00:32:25,526 --> 00:32:26,611
What do you mean?

262
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:29,489
I was always to blame.

263
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:33,451
For what happened to Hye-yeong, Do-ha,

264
00:32:34,827 --> 00:32:35,870
and Han Jeong-won.

265
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:39,749
Why would you be to blame?

266
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:43,044
Hey, In-ji?

267
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:44,671
Are you there? In-ji!

268
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:02,438
NOH IN-JI

269
00:33:04,565 --> 00:33:08,820
The person you have called
is currently unavailable. Please leave…

270
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:11,781
NOH IN-JI

271
00:33:15,576 --> 00:33:17,495
HAN JEONG-WON

272
00:33:57,368 --> 00:33:59,746
You really came here alone.
How fearless of you.

273
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:02,498
Should I be fearful?

274
00:34:02,582 --> 00:34:03,916
No, not you, Ms. In-ji.

275
00:34:06,085 --> 00:34:08,087
- I'll tell you the code.
- Wait.

276
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:11,841
What's the rush? We just got here.

277
00:34:14,844 --> 00:34:17,680
The marriage contract and manual
are both in here, right?

278
00:34:18,264 --> 00:34:19,140
All the evidence.

279
00:34:26,814 --> 00:34:28,274
Why that look on your face?

280
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:31,569
Afraid you'll end up like Seo Do-ha
once I open this?

281
00:34:31,652 --> 00:34:34,322
Are you scared
that people might point fingers at you?

282
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:38,826
You seem to be taking pleasure
in my misfortune, Mr. Eom Tae-seong.

283
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:42,789
Making you miserable publicly
would be ideal.

284
00:34:42,872 --> 00:34:44,999
That way, I'll be all you have left.

285
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:54,634
You saw for yourself back then
what it's like.

286
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:57,303
And what do you get out of this?

287
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:01,224
Do you want to stay by my side
and share my misery?

288
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:07,480
We can still turn this around.

289
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:09,982
Go live your life.

290
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:13,903
If you do that,
I'll forget any of this ever happened.

291
00:35:14,695 --> 00:35:15,613
The thing is…

292
00:35:17,573 --> 00:35:19,492
I wouldn't be miserable.

293
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:24,580
What has your misery got to do with me?

294
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:27,250
I'd just be by your side forever.

295
00:35:30,503 --> 00:35:32,046
That would be me living my life.

296
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:40,555
I killed this pharmacist recently…

297
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:42,515
I told you I killed someone, right?

298
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:45,393
It's easier than you'd think.

299
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:49,272
The cops still have no idea it was me.

300
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:07,456
I'm kayaking in the moonlight
with Ms. In-ji. Care to join?

301
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:10,501
Crazy bastard.

302
00:36:11,085 --> 00:36:12,044
NOH IN-JI

303
00:36:15,047 --> 00:36:17,800
The person you have called
is currently unavailable.

304
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:39,906
What's wrong?

305
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,784
Where did you get this from?

306
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:45,995
Where do you think? Han Jeong-won's house.

307
00:36:46,787 --> 00:36:47,705
The dressing room.

308
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,801
What is it?

309
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:08,809
The lock must have jammed
because you tried to force it open.

310
00:37:11,437 --> 00:37:13,064
No way.

311
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:18,194
You've got to be fucking kidding me!

312
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:23,282
I can fix this if I take it to a store.
Come with me tomorrow.

313
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:28,454
Do you think I'm a fucking idiot?

314
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:33,042
What do you expect me to do?

315
00:37:33,834 --> 00:37:35,711
You should've come to me from the start.

316
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:38,798
You should've come to me
instead of doing something so stupid!

317
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:44,971
God-fucking-damn it!

318
00:37:49,642 --> 00:37:51,102
For fuck's sake.

319
00:38:04,907 --> 00:38:07,535
Will you stop all this nonsense
if I disappear?

320
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:15,251
Mr. Eom Tae-seong.

321
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:18,963
Let's just die together.

322
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:23,175
Isn't that a tempting offer?

323
00:38:29,223 --> 00:38:30,182
Well, fuck me.

324
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:34,979
Your jokes have gotten a lot better.
You almost had me with that one.

325
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:39,400
But we can't die today.

326
00:38:42,945 --> 00:38:44,238
Option two comes first.

327
00:38:45,948 --> 00:38:46,782
"Option two"?

328
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:09,472
Ms. In-ji!

329
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:15,478
If I kill someone,
they'll just send me back to the hospital.

330
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:16,854
Ms. In-ji!

331
00:39:17,563 --> 00:39:20,608
Why the hell are you doing this? Why?

332
00:39:21,567 --> 00:39:22,693
Just because.

333
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:24,945
I'm doing this because I can.

334
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:26,947
Ms. In-ji!

335
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:33,037
Ms. In-ji.

336
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,748
- Are you okay?
- Don't come closer, Mr. Han.

337
00:39:47,593 --> 00:39:48,677
Die!

338
00:40:39,645 --> 00:40:42,273
It's over. You can stop now.

339
00:40:42,356 --> 00:40:43,357
I shot him.

340
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:46,735
I swear I shot him.

341
00:40:48,362 --> 00:40:51,615
It's okay.
What matters is that you're safe.

342
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:20,811
You're okay.

343
00:42:12,071 --> 00:42:13,948
I thought they were live rounds.

344
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:28,128
I was worried I might use them myself.

345
00:42:33,008 --> 00:42:34,343
Maybe I should have.

346
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:39,431
I should've just killed him.

347
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:44,895
Why would you do that?

348
00:42:45,479 --> 00:42:46,730
This is my problem.

349
00:42:51,026 --> 00:42:53,779
Don't go assuming that I did this for you.

350
00:42:54,613 --> 00:42:56,031
That wasn't the case.

351
00:42:58,701 --> 00:43:01,036
I can keep us both safe.

352
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:03,372
That's good.

353
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:07,501
Then go ahead and keep yourself safe.

354
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:11,255
I'll do the same for myself now.

355
00:43:12,298 --> 00:43:13,132
Ms. In-ji…

356
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:19,138
I just want this all to stop.

357
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:24,393
I've…

358
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:27,896
grown tired of it all.

359
00:44:22,368 --> 00:44:25,621
So you fired blanks in self-defense?

360
00:44:27,206 --> 00:44:28,832
Even if it were in self-defense,

361
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:32,836
you know you'll still be punished
for possessing an illegal weapon, right?

362
00:44:35,214 --> 00:44:36,048
Yes.

363
00:44:45,557 --> 00:44:49,103
Who do you think killed Eom Tae-seong?

364
00:45:17,172 --> 00:45:18,173
Damn it.

365
00:46:24,156 --> 00:46:25,157
I keep thinking

366
00:46:25,657 --> 00:46:27,951
that you're the perfect person
for the job, Ji-o.

367
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:35,125
Do you think
you could take care of Eom Tae-seong?

368
00:47:01,568 --> 00:47:03,445
I'll admit it. You were right.

369
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:06,281
This marriage is what suits me.

370
00:47:07,616 --> 00:47:08,992
I'm saying you won.

371
00:47:31,181 --> 00:47:32,766
This shouldn't be like this.

372
00:47:34,935 --> 00:47:36,103
You…

373
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:38,981
Where were you before you got here?

374
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:42,734
I just…

375
00:47:46,613 --> 00:47:48,031
killed someone.

376
00:47:53,078 --> 00:47:54,705
I used to be a keeper for NM.

377
00:48:01,753 --> 00:48:04,798
I was there
when Eom Tae-seong killed my colleague…

378
00:48:07,175 --> 00:48:08,468
but I fled.

379
00:48:09,803 --> 00:48:12,180
It's bothered me ever since.

380
00:48:15,350 --> 00:48:16,977
But that wasn't the only reason.

381
00:48:27,613 --> 00:48:29,197
I quite liked this marriage.

382
00:48:35,704 --> 00:48:37,539
I'll move out as soon as I'm packed.

383
00:49:05,901 --> 00:49:09,488
Why did Eom Tae-seong have your trunk,
Ms. Lee Seo-yeon?

384
00:49:10,238 --> 00:49:11,198
Who knows?

385
00:49:11,823 --> 00:49:14,409
I never used that trunk
because it was hard to open.

386
00:49:14,493 --> 00:49:17,079
So you left it
at Mr. Han Jeong-won's house?

387
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:19,206
I guess I must have.

388
00:49:27,255 --> 00:49:31,009
He was killed by a single stab
from a very long, sharp weapon.

389
00:49:39,142 --> 00:49:40,852
What might fit such a description?

390
00:49:42,729 --> 00:49:46,608
If it were at a construction site,
it could have been a sharp rebar stake.

391
00:49:46,692 --> 00:49:47,526
No.

392
00:49:48,527 --> 00:49:50,445
It was a sharp, smooth weapon.

393
00:49:52,406 --> 00:49:53,782
Aren't those fairly common?

394
00:49:57,619 --> 00:50:00,247
I don't get why
you're asking me such a thing.

395
00:50:09,297 --> 00:50:11,717
If there are no further questions,
can I go home?

396
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:12,843
I'm rather tired.

397
00:50:14,886 --> 00:50:16,888
We've already gone over the contents.

398
00:50:16,972 --> 00:50:19,599
You should also check
that nothing's missing.

399
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:21,518
It would put us in a tight spot

400
00:50:21,601 --> 00:50:23,770
if you later were to claim
something was missing.

401
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:27,250
The realtor says

402
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:30,796
it's a buyer's market,
so they had to lower the price.

403
00:51:33,423 --> 00:51:36,760
Please take good care of them.
I'm sure you've grown attached.

404
00:51:38,345 --> 00:51:40,472
And try to cut back on the coffee.

405
00:51:41,431 --> 00:51:44,101
Mind your own business
and just worry about yourself.

406
00:51:48,730 --> 00:51:49,564
What's wrong?

407
00:51:50,148 --> 00:51:52,150
All that's left for you
is to live happily with him.

408
00:51:55,153 --> 00:51:55,987
Am I wrong?

409
00:51:57,405 --> 00:52:00,075
I wish you the best of luck
with your next field wife.

410
00:52:03,078 --> 00:52:05,622
I knew you knew all along.

411
00:52:06,206 --> 00:52:07,290
You sure are something.

412
00:52:08,792 --> 00:52:09,793
You're just the worst.

413
00:52:10,293 --> 00:52:14,798
I should have told you about it sooner
instead of letting it weigh on me.

414
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:17,884
I'll be going now.

415
00:52:22,973 --> 00:52:24,891
"This too shall pass," you know.

416
00:52:26,059 --> 00:52:27,686
Marriage isn't all it's cracked up to be.

417
00:52:28,311 --> 00:52:30,564
I've been divorced three times.
I should know.

418
00:53:11,313 --> 00:53:12,731
Is that all of your stuff?

419
00:53:14,191 --> 00:53:16,318
A trunk is all you need for a marriage.

420
00:53:26,703 --> 00:53:29,664
I wonder why it never crossed my mind
to leave this place.

421
00:53:31,666 --> 00:53:32,667
Was I afraid?

422
00:53:33,793 --> 00:53:34,836
Probably just lazy.

423
00:53:38,256 --> 00:53:40,258
Only the diligent bother moving.

424
00:53:41,509 --> 00:53:43,011
You need to fight landlords,

425
00:53:44,012 --> 00:53:45,847
buy new fridges and dining tables,

426
00:53:45,931 --> 00:53:48,350
and even find the perfect curtains.

427
00:53:52,354 --> 00:53:54,022
I'm not the lazy one here.

428
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:59,986
If I were you, I'd have moved out
of that house a very long time ago.

429
00:54:03,031 --> 00:54:03,865
Unlikely.

430
00:54:07,369 --> 00:54:09,996
Are you really going
to tear this place down?

431
00:54:10,872 --> 00:54:11,706
Why?

432
00:54:12,832 --> 00:54:15,669
My delicate upbringing
prevents me from standing up to landlords.

433
00:54:16,628 --> 00:54:18,922
I'll grow lazy
and want to crawl back here.

434
00:54:19,005 --> 00:54:22,259
I need to remove the problem at its roots
so I can never return.

435
00:54:40,735 --> 00:54:42,279
You'll be demolishing it anyway.

436
00:54:42,362 --> 00:54:43,405
Join me.

437
00:55:27,657 --> 00:55:28,992
What were you going to say

438
00:55:30,702 --> 00:55:31,995
after "If I were you"?

439
00:55:33,246 --> 00:55:36,374
Was this it?
Me never returning to this house?

440
00:55:39,669 --> 00:55:41,004
Are you doing all this

441
00:55:42,297 --> 00:55:43,798
because of what I said?

442
00:55:45,884 --> 00:55:47,302
Isn't this what you meant?

443
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:50,764
I was thinking…

444
00:55:56,519 --> 00:55:58,021
I would have rented it out…

445
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:01,649
this place.

446
00:56:04,694 --> 00:56:07,864
I meant that I would travel abroad
with the rent money I'd earn.

447
00:56:08,990 --> 00:56:10,950
I didn't think
you'd do something like this.

448
00:56:12,369 --> 00:56:14,662
Rent out the place. Right.

449
00:56:23,296 --> 00:56:24,839
If we ever meet again…

450
00:56:28,468 --> 00:56:30,345
would you stay with me?

451
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:36,101
Who knows?
We might be destined to be together.

452
00:56:37,852 --> 00:56:41,523
Maybe not for our entire lives,
but for around 30 years, perhaps.

453
00:56:48,405 --> 00:56:50,657
What if we run into each other
a second time?

454
00:56:54,702 --> 00:56:56,913
There's no helping it if it happens twice.

455
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:01,626
So the second time.

456
00:57:03,336 --> 00:57:04,546
The second time it is.

457
00:57:12,929 --> 00:57:14,889
Thank you for everything,
Mr. Han Jeong-won.

458
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:23,356
I wanted to tell you that, no matter what.

459
00:58:11,196 --> 00:58:15,825
DEAD BODY DISCOVERED AT LAKE
MURDER SUSPECT TAKEN INTO CUSTODY

460
00:58:36,221 --> 00:58:38,181
Hello, Attorney Choi.

461
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:40,767
I have a case for you.

462
00:58:55,698 --> 00:58:58,201
Ms. Yoon-a called me here
to check out the remodeling.

463
00:58:58,785 --> 00:59:00,119
You don't need to explain.

464
00:59:00,787 --> 00:59:03,915
I know, but I find myself explaining.

465
00:59:07,669 --> 00:59:11,923
I'm re-signing my contract with Ji-o.
I'll also hire him the best lawyer I can.

466
00:59:17,679 --> 00:59:18,513
Seo-yeon.

467
00:59:22,141 --> 00:59:24,394
I once thought
that you were not letting me go,

468
00:59:26,145 --> 00:59:27,105
but in reality…

469
00:59:29,107 --> 00:59:30,858
I wasn't letting you go.

470
00:59:32,277 --> 00:59:36,072
I owed you a proper explanation
as to why we couldn't work.

471
00:59:39,325 --> 00:59:40,451
I'm just a bad person.

472
00:59:41,494 --> 00:59:43,162
That's how I've found my closure.

473
00:59:44,497 --> 00:59:46,499
Believing it hurts my pride less.

474
01:00:28,207 --> 01:00:30,543
Momo. Hey, Momo?

475
01:00:31,628 --> 01:00:32,712
Sleepy, are we?

476
01:00:35,423 --> 01:00:36,424
Hey there, Cookie.

477
01:01:30,228 --> 01:01:31,354
I'm so lonely.

478
01:01:53,376 --> 01:01:59,716
ITERATION

479
01:02:17,984 --> 01:02:20,903
DIRECTED BY NOH SU-HWAN
SCREENPLAY BY YANG JEONG-WON

480
01:02:28,828 --> 01:02:30,580
MUSIC BY HAN JEONG-WON

481
01:02:56,355 --> 01:02:57,440
What is it?

482
01:02:57,523 --> 01:03:01,194
The movie released
after a ten-month delay,

483
01:03:01,277 --> 01:03:02,612
but the reviews are lukewarm.

484
01:03:03,237 --> 01:03:06,783
Then again, who goes to the cinema
to watch horror B-movies nowadays?

485
01:03:08,659 --> 01:03:11,954
I know you're not fishing,
so stop moping and come to the office.

486
01:03:12,038 --> 01:03:13,706
I said I'm not at a fishing spot.

487
01:03:13,790 --> 01:03:16,709
Just hurry back.
I think my wife's going to divorce me.

488
01:03:18,252 --> 01:03:19,253
It's not that bad.

489
01:03:27,637 --> 01:03:30,014
- What did you say this was?
- A file for divorce.

490
01:03:30,723 --> 01:03:32,391
These days, I fill one out daily.

491
01:03:32,892 --> 01:03:33,726
Why?

492
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:36,938
It's the only place I can be alone
without you and the kids.

493
01:03:37,021 --> 01:03:38,147
"The only place"?

494
01:03:38,231 --> 01:03:40,691
You hog our bathroom
because you're constipated.

495
01:03:42,068 --> 01:03:43,361
I have no place of my own.

496
01:03:43,444 --> 01:03:46,072
But you've got a name and title.
Director Oh Hyeon-cheol.

497
01:03:46,656 --> 01:03:51,118
You even have your own office,
while I'm just a mother and wife.

498
01:03:52,620 --> 01:03:55,706
You know I'm the only one of my friends
who's married, right?

499
01:03:56,207 --> 01:03:58,918
They're all living it up as they please,

500
01:03:59,001 --> 01:04:00,586
but I've achieved nothing.

501
01:04:01,295 --> 01:04:04,966
I understand that one of us
needs to take care of the kids.

502
01:04:08,761 --> 01:04:09,846
I get that, but…

503
01:04:14,642 --> 01:04:18,354
I don't think it makes me very happy.

504
01:04:22,817 --> 01:04:23,985
Go see a dermatologist.

505
01:04:24,652 --> 01:04:27,530
Get a laser facial.
I'll give you my personal card.

506
01:04:27,613 --> 01:04:30,199
Why can't we ever have
a serious conversation?

507
01:04:30,992 --> 01:04:32,827
Can't we at least do that?

508
01:04:33,536 --> 01:04:35,830
3,000 won? Seriously?

509
01:04:36,706 --> 01:04:38,332
I can give you more.

510
01:04:39,041 --> 01:04:40,459
No, it's fine. That will do.

511
01:04:41,168 --> 01:04:43,504
You're an odd one,
turning down a better offer.

512
01:04:44,839 --> 01:04:46,257
Did you use it to store a corpse?

513
01:04:48,301 --> 01:04:49,969
Just kidding, of course.

514
01:04:51,846 --> 01:04:54,181
- Have a nice day.
- Thanks, you too.

515
01:04:55,558 --> 01:04:57,476
This really is a beauty.

516
01:04:59,687 --> 01:05:02,023
I wonder what I should use it for.

517
01:05:03,482 --> 01:05:05,443
It's got such a lovely design.

518
01:05:18,205 --> 01:05:20,958
AMERICANO - 3,000 WON

519
01:05:29,216 --> 01:05:30,801
Enjoy.

520
01:05:30,885 --> 01:05:32,136
Thank you.

521
01:07:45,436 --> 01:07:47,521
I was visiting a vet here.

522
01:07:48,773 --> 01:07:50,399
My cat's claw fell out.

523
01:07:52,234 --> 01:07:54,653
I have cats now, by the way.

524
01:07:56,113 --> 01:07:56,947
Right.

525
01:08:00,326 --> 01:08:01,202
Have you been well?

526
01:08:05,956 --> 01:08:07,416
It was scary, by the way.

527
01:08:09,710 --> 01:08:11,545
I saw the movie.

528
01:08:14,298 --> 01:08:16,050
Did you see the end credits?

529
01:08:18,344 --> 01:08:19,762
That's why I went.

530
01:08:29,897 --> 01:08:31,232
This is the first one.

531
01:08:34,568 --> 01:08:36,362
Our first chance encounter.

532
01:08:45,204 --> 01:08:47,039
One more to go.

533
01:08:49,625 --> 01:08:50,459
Yes.

534
01:11:16,522 --> 01:11:19,733
