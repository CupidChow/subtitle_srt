2
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:25,160
Sorry.

3
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:26,320
Today,

4
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,200
I meant to thank you with dinner.

5
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,160
No problem.

6
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:31,520
I'm glad I could

7
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:32,680
help your friend.

8
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,480
As a make-up,

9
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,480
let's

10
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:38,360
meet again tomorrow.

11
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,480
Tomorrow?

12
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,170
Another day?

13
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,240
No, tomorrow it is.

14
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,120
Why not tomorrow?

15
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:44,960
Nanfeng.

16
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,720
Your girlfriend?

17
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:56,720
You...

18
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,800
got together so fast.

19
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,320
No.

20
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,440
But you...

21
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:05,160
Is that

22
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:06,200
your boyfriend?

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,840
No.

24
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,280
Just a friend.

25
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,320
He's so handsome.

26
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,920
Is he

27
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,000
"just a friend"?

28
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:22,800
I'll head back now.

29
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,120
Thanks for walking me home.

30
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,480
Well, I heard

31
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,240
there's a new amusement park.

32
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,360
It's supposed to be fun.

33
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,960
Want to go tomorrow?

34
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,220
As a thank you

35
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,360
for saving me today.

36
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,880
Well, not really

37
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,840
necessary.

38
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,320
It is.

39
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,280
Why not?

40
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,280
I want to go too.

41
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,520
How about we go together then?

42
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,060
Sure.

43
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,080
More people, more fun.

44
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,400
Alright, it's a plan.

45
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,120
We'll head up first.

46
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:56,960
Bye.

47
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,680
Bye.

48
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,360
Nanfeng.

49
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,240
Today...

50
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,360
Nanfeng.

51
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,080
Let's head back together.

52
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,200
Ms. Qin,

53
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,020
Zhiyi

54
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:25,360
contacted the Group's lawyer,

55
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,720
asking them to help her friend

56
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,960
handle divorce and domestic cases.

57
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,680
Divorce?

58
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,120
Domestic violence?

59
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,080
Yes.

60
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,080
Since when did Zhiyi have such friends?

61
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,640
She's her classmate,

62
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,840
and also her roommate.

63
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,720
Zhiyi specifically said

64
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:46,080
the attacker should go to prison.

65
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,640
How could Zhiyi be around such people?

66
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,120
It's too risky.

67
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,480
Don't worry about this for now.

68
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,040
You can leave.

69
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:58,880
Alright.

70
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,320
Aren't you going to the amusement park?

71
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,680
Do you want to be the third wheel?

72
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,200
Are you trying to set them up?

73
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,400
Yes.

74
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,600
What else?

75
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,040
I thought

76
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,160
you thought Zhong Ziye was charming.

77
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,480
Did you think...

78
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,240
Are you jealous?

79
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,760
I shopped for ages to get you this.

80
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,240
It's just adorable.

81
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,200
Let's take pictures.

82
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,080
Sure, let's do it.

83
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,920
Take a photo of me.

84
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,160

don't you remember me?

103
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,640
Who are you?

104
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,560
It's me, Zhang Yangyang from Admin.

105
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,440
When I was a fresher,

106
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,720
you helped me with registration,

107
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,480
and moved my luggage to the dorm.

108
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:20,920
Here.

109
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,840
Come on.

110
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,400
I'm not thirsty.

111
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,660
Then you must be hungry.

112
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:40,640
Let's grab a meal.

113
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,480
Not hungry either.

114
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,800
Not thirsty or hungry...

115
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,600
Are you upset?

116
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,040
I'm not.

117
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,960
I'm really not upset.

118
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,920
You seem upset to me.

119
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,160

Hey, Nanfeng,

122
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,680
I specially picked this.

123
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:14,480
Nice.

124
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,320
Thanks a lot.

125
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,280
- Thank you.
- Bye.

126
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,120
Bye.

127
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,240
Here.

128
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,640
She bought this for you.

129
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,480
Why give it to me?

130
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,360
What do you mean?

131
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,400
I bought this.

132
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,360
You?

133
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,520
Yeah,

134
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,640
I saw you really wanted it,

135
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,440
so I asked someone to buy it.

136
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:33,960
So,

137
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,680
weren't you just adding WeChat?

Adding WeChat?

139
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:38,920
Whose WeChat?

140
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,560
I was paying by scanning.

141
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,760
That girl...

142
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,680
Does she bother you?

143
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,600
Not at all.

144
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,760
Why would I mind?

145
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,220
Then why not hand it over?

146
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,880
Didn't you just refuse?

147
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,600
Fine, I'll get it myself.

148
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,040

00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:01,920
