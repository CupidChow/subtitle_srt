=Episode 5=

2
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:24,160
Then...

3
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,080
I'll have

4
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:26,260
(Osmanthus Tea)
this.

5
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,040
Alright.

6
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,560
Twenty-five.

7
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:36,000
Wait a moment.

8
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,280
(This time,)

9
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,000
(I'll definitely protect you.)

10
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,040
(Let's have a happy ending.)

11
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,320
Excuse me.

12
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,240
Here you go.

13
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,240
Thank you.

14
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,880
Zhong Ziye likes

15
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Xingyue.

16
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:06,190
That's right.

17
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,280
So in the future,

18
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:14,640
he and I...

19
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:17,960
He is indeed your boyfriend in the future.

20
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,200
But it's all for revenge.

21
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:22,840
Revenge?

22
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:26,380
(Zhiyi: Mom, my tutor needs me.
I'll return later. Miss you too.)

23
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,320
So Xingyue's disappearance

24
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,360
is related to me.

25
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,280
What's going on?

26
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,680
I don't know either.

27
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,760
And Zhong Ziye wouldn't explain it.

28
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,680
But I couldn't harm Xingyue.

29
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,280
I believe you.

30
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,920
I know you wouldn't hurt her.

31
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,440
So there must be

32
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,280
some misunderstandings.

33
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,920
(Should I trust what he said?)

34
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,720
Tell me more about the future.

35
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,280
What should I do to save her?

36
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,640
Her disappearance

37
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,000
is a few weeks away.

38
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,760
Don't worry too much.

39
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,180
I'll get to the bottom of it.

40
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,440
- Watch out!
- Watch out!

41
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,800
- Are you okay?
- I'm sorry.

42
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,200
- I'm fine.
- I'll get you a towel.

43
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,120
Hurry up.

44
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,580
(Qin Yu)

45
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,400
Help me!

46
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,560
We've arrived, sir.

47
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,480
You can go.

48
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,320
Coming. What's all this noise? It's late.

49
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,920
Who are you?

50
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,880
Mom, don't do this!

51
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,080
Secretary Wang, please stop.

52
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,320
You lied to me.

53
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,160
It's because I didn't raise you right.

54
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,080
Go on.

55
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,760
I will never lie again.

56
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,080
I will be obedient.

57
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,600
Mom,

58
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,360
what if you fail me again?

59
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,240
Whatever you want.

60
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,880
Come on, Mom, get up.

61
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:44,960
Does it still hurt?

62
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,600
It hurts here.

63
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,520
Zhiyi.

64
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:58,520
I told you.

65
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:00,760
I'm not stopping you from dating.

66
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,600
But I want you to tell me first.

67
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,040
So I can feel at ease.

68
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:05,920
It was because

69
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,600
I neglected to discipline your sister

70
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,360
that caused her death from drunk driving.

71
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,680
I know.

72
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,000
You're only looking out for me.

73
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,880
You know that.

74
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,160
I would rather punish myself

75
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,680
than harm you in any way.

76
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,200
You need to listen to me.

77
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,640
Understand?

78
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,880
If I catch you disobeying again,

79
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,280
I'll keep you close,

80
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,400
never leave my side.

81
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,560
Understand?

82
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,040
Yes.

83
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,400
Have 300k ready.

84
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,360
Come to the Ghost Building
at 3 PM tomorrow.

85
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,640
Or it'll go public.

86
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,560
What's wrong?

87
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:55,880
It's nothing.

88
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,240
It's getting late.

89
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,400
Get some rest.

90
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,400
Call Secretary Wang in, please.

91
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,680
Okay, Mom. Good night.

92
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,280
Ms. Qin.

93
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,600
Look into

94
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,120
the boy who had dinner with Zhiyi today.

95
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,320
Yes.

96
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,520
(That photo differs from Zhao Gao's.)

97
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,480
(Who else wants to blackmail me?)

98
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,880
(Anyway,)

99
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,280
(I must not let Mom know.)

100
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,720
All the footage from that day is here.

101
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,640
Liu,

102
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,600
why is this video blacked out?

103
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,840
The camera is broken.

104
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,760
It isn't fixed yet.

105
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,080
Wait, zoom in here.

106
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,720
(Could Zhou Nanfeng be telling the truth?)

107
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,960
(Zhong Ziye has an ulterior motive.)

108
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,560
(That photo could only be taken)

109
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,080
(during that time)

110
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,600
(and from that angle.)

111
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,680
(But why is it him?)

112
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,040
Boss,

113
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:36,920
I probably

114
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,040
won't sing here anymore.

115
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,440
Why?

116
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,040
Don't worry about this.

117
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,240
- Yaya.
- Boss, I'm leaving.

118
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,160
Yaya.

119
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,920
Yaya!

120
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,640
Who is it?

121
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:10,620

122
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,960
