2
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,800
Make a sound and you're done for.

3
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,200
(It's strange
for a board to fall suddenly.)

4
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,400
(I need to inspect it closely.)

5
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,000
(See if I can find some clues.)

6
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,880
(As suspected,)

7
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,280
(Zhong Ziye and Song Xingyue are in cahoots.)

8
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,000
(I must escape quickly.)

9
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,200
(Neatly arranged.)

10
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,640
(Looks like it's been tampered.)

11
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,200
(Was the board's fall no accident?)

12
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,600
(Could it be a planned attack?)

13
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,840
Who is there?

14
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,600
Xingyue?

15
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,880
What are you doing here?

16
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,000
Why are you here too?

17
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,920
About last time's accident,

18
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,480
Zhiyi didn't tell me anything.

19
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,200
And I can't find Gao Qiang,

20
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,800
so I came to see
if there were any clues.

21
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,640
It's dangerous here.

22
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,520
You should leave.

23
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,800
What's happening?

24
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,880
I'll explain later.

25
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,760
Go back first.

26
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,600
No need to ask.

27
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,400
Don't worry about it.

28
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,720
What's that sound?

29
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,080
Xingyue!

30
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,680
Since we were kids,

31
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,760
I've never lied to you.

32
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,800
And I won't now.

33
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,920
Trust me.

34
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,520
Please go back, okay?

35
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,080
Alright.

36
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,640
Take care, okay?

37
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,720
Doctor, he needs a dressing change.

38
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,200
Alright, sit here.

39
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,120
Okay.

40
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,200
Take your shirt off.

41
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,120
Okay.

42
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,680
Are you taking it off or not?

43
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,840
I will.

44
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,920
I'll head to the restroom.

45
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,080
I've seen this before.

46
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,760
Why so nervous?

47
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:02,600
Hello?

48
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,160
It's Gao Qiang.

49
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,660
Get to the Ghost Building.

50
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,220
What?

51
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:10,580
Zhong Ziye tied me up.

52
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:12,460
I barely escaped.

53
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,180
He hurt me.

54
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,620
I can't run far now.

55
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,700
Send help quickly.

56
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,180
I'll tell you

57
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,180
everything.

58
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:22,260
Wait for me.

59
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,180
Doctor, where's that boy?

60
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:31,020
Didn't he just go to find you?

61
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:43,420
(He isn't answering it.)

62
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:46,660
(Answer the phone, Zhou Nanfeng.)

63
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:49,400
- Miss, anything else?
- Hello?

64
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,560
The number you dialed is busy.

65
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,020
Nothing.

66
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:55,740
