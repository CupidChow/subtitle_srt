2
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:58,720
Nanfeng.

3
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:00,520
Could you help me?

4
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,440
Can I get Xingyue's roommate's contact?

5
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:03,880
Xingyue hasn't shown up,

6
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,560
and I can't reach her.

7
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:06,880
I'm a bit worried.

8
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,360
Zhiyi was taken by her mom.

9
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,440
I can't contact her either.

10
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,280
Alright,

11
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,440
if you see Xingyue,

12
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,440
please let her know,

13
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,080
I'm waiting at the amusement park.

14
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:16,110
Okay,

15
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:16,960
thanks.

16
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:17,920
Goodbye.

17
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,320
You skipped the meeting to tell me

18
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,440
Zhiyi is from the future?

19
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,120
Yes.

20
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,720
How is that possible?

21
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,560
Because I'm like her.

22
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,240
I come from the future too.

23
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,600
You...

24
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,160
I know clearly

25
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,640
what she would do or not do.

26
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,120
Sounds unbelievable.

27
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,080
How can I trust you?

28
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,640
Well, at least believe

29
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,640
that I'd never harm Zhiyi.

30
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:10,000
Then tell me,

31
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,480
what's the purpose?

32
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,120
To protect Qin Zhiyi.

33
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,800
Because

34
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,960
you once said in that time,

35
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,480
what you see of us

36
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:24,880
may not be the real us.

37
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,480
Zhou Nanfeng,

38
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,080
how did you return to the past?

39
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,880
Please tell me,

40
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,200
I need to go back to save him.

41
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:37,960
No way.

42
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,960
I'm begging you.

43
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,960
Just tell me.

44
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,480
Just this once.

45
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,520
It's useless.

46
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,920
I've tried it.

47
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,320
Even if you go back,

48
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,560
and see Zhong Ziye,

49
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,560
he may not be the same.

50
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,160
I tried many times to get here.

51
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,000
So,

52
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
think carefully.

53
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,420
Do you really want to be with

54
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:03,520
Zhiyi from another timeline?

55
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,400
I don't want her

56
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,160
to end up hurt.

57
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,720
Zhiyi,

58
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,720
are you dating?

59
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,120
No,

60
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,440
but soon.

61
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,120
Mom, why did you call me?

62
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,480
Do you want our lawyer to help your friend,

63
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,520
Song Xingyue?

64
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:33,880
Yes.

65
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,000
I can help.

66
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,600
But you must cut ties with her.

67
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,320
Someone like her shouldn't be your friend.

68
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,120
It's too risky.

69
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,800
No way.

70
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,880
What?

71
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,880
You're not listening to me anymore?

72
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,760
Mom, I'm grown up now.

73
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,600
I have the right to choose my own life.

74
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,760
Say that again.

75
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,040
I said,

76
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,400
I'm grown up now.

77
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,080
I have the right to choose my own life.

78
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,360
Who taught you that,

79
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,480
Xingyue or that boy?

80
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:27,880
I admit

81
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,720
it was Zhou Nanfeng who gave me courage.

82
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,360
But more importantly,

83
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,720
if I keep playing

84
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,240
the perfect daughter you want,

85
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,240
I'll lose myself.

86
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,760
I might even lose my friends.

87
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,680
I don't want that.

88
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,080
I think you're blinded by love.

89
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,160
Break up with him now.

90
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,440
No way.

91
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,520
Secretary Wang,

92
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:52,760
bring the whip.

93
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,040
Yes.

94
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,160
Mom, no more moral coercion.

95
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,280
If there's nothing else,

96
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,920
I'll head back to school.

97
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,760
You...

98
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,280
Ms. Qin,

99
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,680
do you still want it?

100
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,400
That scared me.

101
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:34,580
(Dummy; Where are you? I want to see you.)

102
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,280
Zhou Nanfeng, come with me.

103
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,320
Wait, what's this?

104
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,280
Don't speak yet,

105
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,360
listen to me first.

106
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,520
Today, I did something

107
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,520
I've always wanted to do,

108
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,000
but never had the courage to.

109
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,720
From now on,

110
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,880
I'll be myself.

111
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,560
I'll fix every mistake

112
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,560
and make things right.

113
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,160
I want everyone

114
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,080
to have a good ending.

115
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,760
So,

116
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,240
you'll support me,

117
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,400
right?

118
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,440
(Fix?)

119
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,520
(Ending?)

120
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,800
(Is she really from the future?)

121
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,240
- I...
- Here comes our Yaya.

122
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,880
She's bringing us a great show.

123
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,300
- I know what you want to say.
- Fire up!

124
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,480
I also want to

125
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,840
tell you what I'm thinking.

126
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,480
I...

127
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,280
Here we go!

128
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,800
No rock today.

129
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,440
I have a special song

130
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,120
dedicated to someone

131
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,480
who means the world

132
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,800
