00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:22,440
Nanfeng.

3
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,320
Miss Qin.

4
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,240
Sorry,

5
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,840
I didn't mean to hit you.

6
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:35,560
I was just teaching a lesson

7
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:36,480
to my daughter.

8
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,400
But...

9
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,120
you hurt me badly.

10
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,560
My face really hurts.

11
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:41,920
Tell me,

12
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,040
what should you do now?

13
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:47,680
Blame my careless hand.

14
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:48,920
It just acted on its own.

15
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,440
I'm really sorry. Please forgive me.

16
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,520
Sorry again.

17
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,240
What are you looking for?

18
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:57,840
This one.

19
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:58,760
Is there more?

20
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,440
Yes, there is.

21
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,640
Hand it to me.

22
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,320
Why do you need this?

23
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:10,760
You,

24
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:11,680
step back.

25
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,240
Back.

26
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,320
Keep moving back.

27
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,200
How far back?

28
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,120
Just move.

29
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,040
Move.

30
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,480
Okay.

31
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,520
Alright.

32
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:21,920
Stay there, don't move.

33
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,600
Xingyue, hold this, help me hit him.

34
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,150
Miss... Miss.. Miss Qin.

35
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,640
What's fun about hitting me?

36
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,080
It's to vent my anger.

37
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,360
Imagine if my mom finds out

38
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,320
that you hit me,

39
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,240
what would she do?

40
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,520
Xingyue.

41
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,360
Come on.

42
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,280
Don't be scared.

43
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,040
Here, I'll hold it.

44
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,360
Or maybe forget it.

45
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,680
If he bullies you, he bullies me.

46
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,400
Actually, it's perfect.

47
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,720
My lawyer's pretty free lately.

48
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,280
Xingyue.

49
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,200
Hurry.

50
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,440
Stand still.

51
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,680
Just hit him.

52
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,440
I hit you.

53
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,120
I hit you.

54
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,160
I hit you.

55
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,760
How could you bully me?

56
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,080
How dare you!

57
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,880
- This is a no-go.
- Xingyue.

58
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,360
Don't use that.

59
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,280
That one's not okay.

60
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,240
Enough.

61
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,600
Alright, I've calmed down now.

62
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,360
I won't tell my mom.

63
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,520
Thanks, Miss Qin.

64
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,440
Well,

65
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,200
Miss Qin,

66
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,600
you all enjoy yourselves.

67
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,480
I have to head out for a bit.

68
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,280
Take your time, have fun.

69
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,200
Hold on.

70
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,880
Miss Qin, anything else?

71
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,520
Xingyue and I

72
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,520
are the best of friends.

73
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,680
I'll be visiting her often.

74
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,520
So,

75
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,120
if I see

76
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,080
something like today again,

77
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,960
I can't promise something bad won't happen.

78
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,280
You get what I mean?

79
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,560
Got it.

80
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,400
I promise you.

81
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,380
It won't happen again,

82
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:01,360
for sure.

83
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,720
Right, Xingyue?

84
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,640
Alright.

85
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,920
Glad you understand.

86
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,880
Why are you still here?

87
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,120
Get lost!

88
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,120
You guys chill, I'm leaving.

89
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,520
I'm gone, you have fun.

90
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,280
Xingyue,

91
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,560
are you alright?

92
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,600
I'm okay.

93
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,880
Thank you.

94
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,640
Let's go, check your injury.

95
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,320
Take care of yourself.

96
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,880
Does it hurt?

97
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,440
Xingyue,

98
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,000
why not call the police?

99
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,120
He's still

100
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,720
my mom's legal spouse.

101
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,840
If I push him too far,

102
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,600
he'll kick my mom out of the hospital.

103
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:11,160
They could get a divorce.

104
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,800
But my mom...

105
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,680
had a stroke. She's in a coma.

106
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,320
She can't sign anything.

107
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,280
And

108
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:21,960
Gao Qiang

109
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,160
is eyeing my mom's house.

110
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,360
He'll never agree to divorce.

111
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,680
Xingyue,

112
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,160
whatever happens,

113
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,280
you can come to me.

114
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:40,680
I'll protect you.

115
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,250
You don't need to.

116
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:45,480
I'm used to it.

117
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,240
Plus,

118
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,400
I don't want my story out there.

119
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,400
I don't need pity.

120
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,720
Xingyue.

121
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,920
I'll help you.

122
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,200
Don't worry.

123
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,120
Why?

124
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,400
Because we're friends.

125
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,640
Friends help each other.

126
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,560
(Since)

127
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,960
(I've decided not to repeat history,)

128
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,720
(they)

129
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,080
(deserve a better ending too.)

130
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,360
What's up?

131
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,360
Nothing.

132
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,080
Didn't you say you wanted to thank me?

133
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,560
How about this?

134
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,400
Later today,

135
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,120
help me check the basketball court.

136
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,160
See if it's still open.

137
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,720
Why go there?

138
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,400
Don't worry about it.

139
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,600
Just say if you'll go.

140
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,040
I will.

141
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,600
Good.

142
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,200
Your three-pointer is spot on.

143
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,360
Teach me someday, okay?

144
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,040
No problem, I'll show you.

145
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,120
Seems pretty hard.

146
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,200
It's quite simple.

147
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,880
Alright, we're heading out.

148
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:52,800
Bye.

149
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,600
Okay, see you.

150
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,520
Bye.

151
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:17,180
(Freshers! Welcome to Yunchuan University.)

152
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,360
Did you check today's schedule?

153
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,440
There are so few classes.

154
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,960
Hello, are you a freshman?

155
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,280
Which department?

156
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:26,400
Law is ahead.

157
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,240
Hello, please register here.

158
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,360
Just walk straight.

159
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,480
Over there.

160
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,640
Finance is over there.

161
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,320
Go ahead, no need to thank me.

162
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,360
Hello.

163
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,360
What's your major?

164
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,800
Physical Education.

165
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,720
It is over there.

166
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,360
I'll lead you the way. Follow me.

Reach out if you need anything.

(Freshers! Welcome to Yunchuan University.)

171
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,080
Watch out!

172
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,120
Miss.

173
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,200
Thank you.

174
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,600
It's nothing.

175
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:19,190
I'm Zhong Ziye.

176
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,560
What's your name?

177
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,040
Song Xingyue.

178
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,880
(No reaction.)

179
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,720
