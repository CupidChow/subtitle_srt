Zhou Nanfeng,

3
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,440
I like you.

4
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:25,960
Can we be together?

5
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,720
Say yes!

6
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:37,720
Say yes!

7
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,760
Say yes!

8
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,000
Sorry.

9
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:55,760
Zhou Nanfeng!

10
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:01,920
Zhou Nanfeng!

11
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,360
Zhou Nanfeng!

12
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,280
Zhou Nanfeng!

13
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,200
(Zhiyi, I'm sorry.)

14
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,960
(I need more time to think it through.)

15
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,760
What's going on?

16
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,070
Xingyue!

17
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:41,920
Where did you go?

18
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,680
Why didn't you show up that day?

19
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,880
I never promised I'd come.

20
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:48,120
What's wrong?

21
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,560
We agreed yesterday.

22
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,960
- We...
- What do you mean by "we"?

23
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,120
We just met yesterday,

24
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,480
and I didn't promise you.

25
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,240
Don't contact me anymore.

26
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,480
What do you mean by "just met"?

27
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,560
I'm Zhong Ziye.

28
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:04,160
The boy who followed you around.

29
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,000
You shared candies with me.

30
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,760
You don't know me now?

31
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:10,760
No.

32
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,800
Then let's start fresh,

33
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,640
okay?

34
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:16,760
Let go.

35
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:18,920

I also turned down Zhiyi.

52
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,960
Not sure if we should be together.

53
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:25,020
She's different from before.

54
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:27,200
I won't date with Zhong Ziye,

55
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,250
at least for now.

56
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,120
You're so certain.

57
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:31,660
I have many unfinished tasks.

I won't be weak anymore.

I can't drag him down.

61
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,320
What's your plan?

62
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,200
What are you doing?

63
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:44,880
Let's get moving.

No one leaves!

66
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,920
Explain yourselves clearly.

67
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,800
Then let me be clear.

68
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,840
We're together now.

69
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,040
Happy now?

70
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,360
Can we go?

71
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,080
Are you serious?

72
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:12,920
Yes, seriously.

73
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,640
We're together now.

74
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,040
Sorry, Zhiyi.

75
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,520
Will this really fool them?

76
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,360
I have no idea.

77
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:46,800
Anyway,

78
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,080
I'm going to find Gao Qiang.

79
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,080
See what he's up to.

80
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,560
After all, it's all because of him.

81
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,760
Alright, thank you.

82
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:00,880
Come with me.

83
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,720
Zhou Nanfeng.

84
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,480
Why did you

85
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,680
bring me here?

86
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,360
Are you and Zhou Nanfeng

87
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,080
really together?

88
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,270
Yes.

89
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,160
You're lying!

90
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,360
Since I started school,

91
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,480
I know every person

92
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,400
around you well.

93
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:47,400
You and Zhou Nanfeng

94
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,440
have no connection.

95
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,600
How could you be together?

96
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,640
It just shows

97
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,320
you're not observant enough.

98
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,600
Do you really dislike me?

99
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,960
So much that you'd lie

100
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,360
just to keep me away.

101
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:00,800
Yes,

102
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,080
I do dislike you.

103
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,120
I've disliked you since childhood.

104
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,720
You always followed me back then,

105
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,560
never letting me play with others.

106
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,160
And you're still the same now.

107
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,480
You're so annoying.

108
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,080
