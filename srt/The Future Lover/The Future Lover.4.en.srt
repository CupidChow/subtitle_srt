2
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,000
Who's this guy?

3
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:26,960
Is he looking for you?

4
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,880
Let's play next time.

5
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,600
- Head back.
- Such a letdown.

6
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:38,880
Don't invite me next time.

7
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,280
Why are you here again?

8
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,680
I've made myself clear.

9
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,480
I didn't blackmail Qin Zhiyi.

10
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,080
Has Zhong Ziye been here?

11
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:02,920
Ziye who?

12
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,080
Never heard of him.

13
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,520
(He didn't come.)

14
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,160
Someone might visit you soon.

15
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,040
But no matter what he says,

16
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,120
don't believe it.

17
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,280
He might get you killed.

18
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,240
Who's coming to see me?

19
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,200
Who wants to kill me?

20
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,400
Just remember my words.

21
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,400
Wait, make it clear.

22
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,720
Who's after me?

23
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,720
The girl who just left,

24
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,280
what's her relation to you?

25
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,200
Her?

26
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,960
She's my wife's kid from her ex,

27
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,400
Song Xingyue.

28
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,400
(Could she be the problem?)

29
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,000
Song Xingyue.

30
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,680
Explain who's after me.

31
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,120
(With Zhao Gao's cash,)

32
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:02,440
(things will be easier.)

33
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,840
Zhong Ziye.

34
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,040
Zhiyi.

35
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,120
I figured it out.

36
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,000
Zhou Nanfeng tricked me.

37
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,000
That's great.

38
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,080
Now I'm relieved.

39
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,760
But I...

40
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:17,960
still want to know.

41
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,880
What really happened in the future?

42
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,520
Watch out!

43
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,280
Thanks.

44
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,440
No problem.

45
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,840
(Why is he after Xingyue now?)

46
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,360
(How did he end up with Xingyue?)

47
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,760
(Zhiyi still chooses to trust Zhong Ziye.)

48
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,320
(Are they together now?)

49
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,400
Stay away from Song Xingyue.

50
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,200
Everything you did

51
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,200
was for Song Xingyue, right?

52
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,840
What are you really trying to do?

53
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,440
I just know her past life.

54
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,360
Don't worry.

55
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,740
I also know in our timeline,

56
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:08,360
a girl with the surname Song disappeared.

57
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,040
Song Xingyue, right?

58
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,160
I'm warning you.

59
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,440
If you dare hurt her,

60
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,920
I won't let you off.

61
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,920
So, you're doing all this

62
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,560
to avenge Song Xingyue.

63
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,920
You won't spare anyone who hurt her,

64
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,000
right?

65
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,280
What else do you know?

66
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,720
Song Xingyue's disappearance

67
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,960
is linked to Qin Zhiyi,

68
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,160
right?

69
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,560
Yes.

70
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,520
So,

71
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,360
I'll never forgive Qin Zhiyi.

72
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,000
I won't let you harm her!

73
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,880
- You...
- You...

74
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,800
You go ahead.

75
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,320
That guy earlier...

76
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,800
Are you together now?

77
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,080
Right now...

78
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,400
I wouldn't say that.

79
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,080
Wouldn't say?

80
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,920
Do you like him?

81
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,520
I...

82
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,000
I'm not sure.

83
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,560
Then,

84
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:12,180
does he like you?

85
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,960
Probably.

86
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,040
He's trying to woo you.

87
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,080
Xingyue,

88
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,120
what's wrong?

89
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,520
I'm fine.

90
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:24,880
By the way,

91
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,640
what did you want to ask me?

92
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,800
You and...

93
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,120
Zhou Nanfeng,

94
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,880
do you know each other?

95
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:34,120
Do you mean that guy from earlier?

96
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,720
We just met at the school gate.

97
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,360
He said

98
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,320
he forgot his wallet.

99
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,240
I paid for his cab fare.

100
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,160
Xingyue.

101
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,080
Stay away from him.

102
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,000
- Why?
- He's a liar.

103
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,880
A liar?

104
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,560
He seems honest to me.

105
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,760
He told me to go to the field

106
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,840
and he'll return my money.

107
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,920
I'll go for you.

108
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,520
(So Zhong Ziye likes Zhiyi.)

109
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,400
(Zhong Ziye,)

110
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,680
(do you know?)

111
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,720
(I've always liked you.)

112
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,040
(You're my guiding light.)

113
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,200
Hurry, get out!

114
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:13,360
Don't touch me!

115
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,480
Dare to interrupt my game?

116
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,800
I'll keep you out of here.

117
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,440
This is my mom's place.

118
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,500
How dare you kick me out?

119
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,800
If it weren't for this house,

120
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,160
I'd have divorced her ages ago.

121
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,160
Do you think I care to stay with you?

122
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,680
Knock again,

123
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,160
and I'll unplug your mom's machine.

124
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,090

what's the point of living like this?

You knew I'd come.

142
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,040
I did plan to repay Song Xingyue,

143
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,980
but when I saw you with Zhong Ziye

144
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,000
at the basketball court,

145
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,280

151
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,920
