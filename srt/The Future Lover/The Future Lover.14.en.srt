but now you won't admit you like me.

13

I need some space to calm down.

Over there!

Your mom's people are here.

Miss Qin!

Stop running! It's dangerous.

Stop running, Miss Qin!

22
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,200
Miss Qin.

23
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,160
Zhou Nanfeng.

24
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,080
Miss Qin.

25
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,360

Zhou Nanfeng.

31
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,080
You must hold on, Zhou Nanfeng.

32
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,320
Zhiyi.

33
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,480
Take care of your wound first.

34
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,360
No.

35
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,520
I need to wait for him.

36
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,280
What are you doing?

37
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,520
Let go of me!

38
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,160
Mom, I'm begging you.

39
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,680
Let me wait for him a bit.

40
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,120
Let me wait for him.

41
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,400
My daughter,

42
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:45,600
how could you be like this?

43
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:46,840
Get up!

44
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,880
The victim isn't breathing.

45
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,520
We've done all we can.

46
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,840
How could it be like this?

47
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,520
He was fine just now.

48
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,080
How did this happen?

49
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,200
Zhiyi!

50
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,320
Zhiyi!

51
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,080
Zhiyi.

52
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,440
Xingyue, why are you here?

53
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,320
When you got to the hospital,

54
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:37,800
I saw it.

55
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,200
So, I knew everything.

56
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,600
Are you

57
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,640
okay?

58
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,920
I heard you allowed someone

59
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,000
to see Qin Zhiyi.

60
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,600
I'm worried about Zhiyi.

61
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,460
She's skipping meals.

62
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:50,520
Her body will break down.

63
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,800
That girl said she's a friend.

64
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,640
I think Zhiyi might want to see her.

65
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,040
It could lift her spirits.

66
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,840
Anyway, Zhiyi and I are going abroad.

67
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,180
This won't happen again.

68
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,320
Yes.

69
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,400
When claiming his belongings,

70
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,400
you were still unconscious,

71
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,880
so I handled it for you.

72
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,640
This...

73
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,880
is Zhou Nanfeng's belonging.

74
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,080
I glanced at it.

75
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,640
You're better suited to keep it.

76
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,040
I believe

77
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,000
he wanted you to live happily.

78
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,720
I'll head out, Zhiyi.

79
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,120
April 3rd,

80
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,200
2014,

81
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,120
Sunny.

82
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:51,040
I think I saw Yaya.

83
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,920
Before

84
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:17,600
I always thought

85
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,360
once I had enough strength,

86
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,960
I'd help her escape Qin Yu's control,

87
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,000
then confess my feelings.

88
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,680
But I realized I missed her life.

89
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,120
Since fate can change this time,

90
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,280
I want to boldly

91
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,840
stand by her side.

92
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:43,660
(I want to boldly stand by her side.)

93
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,760
You've liked me for so long.

94
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,480
Why didn't you say earlier?

95
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,560
Why?

96
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,600
September 23, 2015,

97
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,640
Cloudy.

98
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,880
Zhong Ziye framed me,

99
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,400
trying to split Yaya and me.

100
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,880
That's when I realized

101
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,480
he also time-traveled.

102
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,320
Although burning the diary
could send me back

103
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,440
to change everything,

104
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,400
what if something else goes wrong?

105
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,840
Better deal with things as they come.

106
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,880
"Burning the diary

107
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,840
could send me back"...

108
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,160
This time,

109
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,600
I'll be the one to save you.

110
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:03,020
(Literature School)

111
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,480
(I really went back in time!)

112
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,080
(This is great!)

113
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:13,320
Hey, Zhiyi,

114
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,200
why so quiet?

115
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:16,720
Mom, I'm heading home soon.

116
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,480
(If I remember correctly,)

117
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,280
(I would be...)

118
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,680
Hand over the money!

119
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,280
- Get lost!
- Just you wait.

120
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:37,920
(That voice is...)

121
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,320
(It's really him.)

122
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:48,840
Hey,

123
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,880
are you alright?

124
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,520
Hello?

125
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,840
