00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:32,080
Here are the keys and phone cards.

3
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:32,920
If you need anything,

4
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,040
just reach out to me.

5
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:35,800
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

6
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:38,000
Have you

7
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:39,640
decided to be together?

8
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:42,120
Yes, there's something I want to change.

9
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,600
So whatever happens,

10
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,640
we will handle it together.

11
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:56,640
Well,

12
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,240
before my mom finds me,

13
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,280
let's think about how to

14
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,680
help Xingyue deal with Gao Qiang?

15
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,080
Gao Qiang is cunning.

16
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,360
He controls the level of abuse,

17
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,480
making it hard to punish him by law.

18
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,200
But if he blackmails Zhiyi again,

19
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,480
he might face his own downfall.

20
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,000
But

21
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,120
how can we get him

22
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,840
into the bar unguarded?

23
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,720
Gao Qiang loves money,

24
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:24,920
maybe

25
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:25,960
we can tempt him.

26
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,120
Let me handle it.

27
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,520
He doesn't know me,

28
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,880
and might let his guard down.

29
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,630
Alright,

30
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,480
here's the plan.

31
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,960
You two find Gao Qiang.

32
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,880
Your job is to lure him into the bar

33
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,560
and instigate him to snap photos.

34
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,880
Yaya performs as usual.

35
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,320
I'll wait at the entrance.

36
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,560
In case Qin Yu's guys

37
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,120
show up early and ruin it.

38
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,480
- Okay.
- Okay.

39
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,720
We only have one shot.

40
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,240
It must be flawless.

41
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,400
Money lost, peace gained.

42
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,720
Isn't this Brother Qiang?

43
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,680
It's me, Zhong.

44
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,720
At the start of the year,

45
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,720
we played cards together.

46
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,440
3,000 debt, remember?

47
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,120
No, that's a mistake.

48
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,160
I never borrowed money.

49
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,030
No, no.

50
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:28,920
Brother Qiang.

51
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,280
You lent me 3,000.

52
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,480
Did I?

53
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,200
Back then,

54
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,520
I was losing badly.

55
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,440
Without you,

56
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,680
I wouldn't have won the game.

57
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,360
Oh, right.

58
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,780
I wanted to thank you with a drink.

59
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:43,080
I remember, I remember.

60
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,080
Hold on a second.

61
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,040
Hey,

62
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,440
are you Brother Qiang?

63
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,040
Yes, I am. In this area,

64
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,800
I'm the only Brother Qiang.

65
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:55,400
Catch you later.

66
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,760
Let's grab a drink.

67
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,640
No need for that now.

68
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,640
It's a rare chance.

69
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,080
I'll take you somewhere fun.

70
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,600
Let's go.

71
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,900
(Mission Hook)

72
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,000
The bait's on its way.

73
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,040
Come on, come on.

74
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,080
- It's lively here.
- Indeed.

75
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,080
Come on,

76
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,280
let's sit here.

77
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,760
Alright, alright.

78
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,960
What'll you drink?

79
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,000
I'm easy.

80
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,040
Easy? Then I'll choose.

81
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:24,880
Alright.

82
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,800
Four bottles of beer.

83
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,830
Sir,

84
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,680
two glasses here.

85
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,200
How's the vibe? Pretty good, right?

86
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,840
Yeah, it's quite lively.

87
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,040
There's live music

88
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,240
at night.

89
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,460
I heard

90
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,040
it's local college students performing.

91
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,060
Really buzzing.

92
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:44,960
Is that so?

93
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,800
Brother Qiang,

94
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,080
I toast to you.

95
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:47,960
Cheers, cheers.

96
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,260
Brother Qiang,

97
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,100
(Mission Hook)
Relax and have fun.

98
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,200
(Hooked)
Feel the vibe.

99
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,920
- Loosen up.
- Alright.

100
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:00,760
Let's get hyped!

101
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,400
Do you come here often?

102
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,600
I visit here a lot.

103
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,680
Lots of young people here.

104
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,800
There's a live band, right?

105
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,760
Yeah, it's popular.

106
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,640
- Nice place.
- Really nice.

107
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,840
Brother Qiang,

108
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:15,990
tonight's band

109
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,120
is the one

110
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,520
that sold out tickets like crazy before!

111
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:20,660
- Zhiyi.
- Super hot.

112
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,560
- All set.
- Really?

113
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:22,560
Good.

114
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,000
We got lucky today.

115

That's great.

I think I've met her before.

122
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,400
Isn't she the Qin's Group heiress?

123
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,000
