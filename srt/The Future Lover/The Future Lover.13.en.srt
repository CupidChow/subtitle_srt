2
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,560
It's been days,

3
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,720
and you still haven't found them.

4
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:30,400
What have you been doing?

5
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,480
What's the point of having you?

6
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,160
Zhiyi doesn't have a phone or card.

7
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,560
Nor has she checked into a hotel.

8
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:42,840
That's why

9
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,520
we can't trace their whereabouts.

10
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:47,040
We're checking all the small inns now.

11
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,460
I believe it won't take long

12
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:49,480
to find them.

13
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:50,520
We must find them.

14
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:54,120
If anything happens to Zhiyi,

15
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:56,150
I won't let any of you off.

16
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,040
Yes.

17
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,400
Room 1008.

18
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,430
- Okay.
- Upstairs.

19
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,960
Did you have fun today?

20
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,160
It was alright.

21
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,760
Let's catch a movie later.

22
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:06,960
Sure thing.

23
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,160
Boss, get a room.

24
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,360
Eighty yuan.

25
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,600
Your ID card.

26
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,520
We don't have one.

27
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,640
College students?

28
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,920
Why do you care?

29
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,480
No ID cards.

30
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,560
Then two hundred.

31
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,280
Room 109.

32
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:50,800
Young folks,

33
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,760
stay safe.

34
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,800
We've stayed in many hotels.

35
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,880
Seriously,

36
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,920
each time is

37
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,480
more eye-opening.

38
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,120
I'll change my dressing.

39
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,920
This restroom's transparent.

40
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,120
I'll head out first.

41
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,320
Okay.

42
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,760
Hurry and change.

43
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,120
You're here.

44
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,000
Why are you drinking?

45
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,040
Just thinking about a lot of things.

46
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,240
Feeling a bit emotional.

47
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,840
So I felt like drinking.

48
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,920
I wonder

49
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,200
how Xingyue is doing now.

50
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,120
She still has her mom to care for.

51
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,240
So no matter what, she'll hang on.

52
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,320
She will definitely make it.

53
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,080
Don't worry.

54
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,720
So, tell me

55
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,720
about your situation.

56
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,120
How did you

57
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,520
come back from the future

58
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,120
to the present?

59
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,040
I just stumbled upon it.

60
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,880
Yaya left

61
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,160
10 years ago.

62
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,760
But I still think of her.

63
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:56,960
I always regret it.

64
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,520
If I had been braver then

65
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,120
and confessed to her,

66
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,680
would the ending

67
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,520
have been different?

68
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,400
I wish I could

69
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,360
go back in time.

70
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,690
(Yaya left 10 years ago.)

71
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,120
Could it be

72
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,520
that I can go back?

73
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,520
Yaya,

74
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,960
I can save you now.

75
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,280
Tell me,

76
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,240
how did you discover it?

77
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,080
I just stumbled upon it.

78
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,280
So,

79
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,480
how did you travel back?

80
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,600
Like...

81
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,200
from "A Chinese Odyssey", you know,

82
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,360
"Moonlight Treasure Box".

83
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,280
Sort of.

84
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,280
None of that matters now.

85
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,480
Let's talk about you.

86
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,120
Do you really not remember me?

87
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,920
What do you mean?

88
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,160
Have we met before?

89
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,880
Yes.

90
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,880
Back at the orphanage.

91
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,160
When we were kids.

92
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,440
Orphanage?

93
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,320
What?

94
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,680
Let me see

95
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,360
your face.

96
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,800
I really can't remember.

97
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,440
Who were you as a kid?

98
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,920
Not important.

99
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,200
It doesn't matter either.

100
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,320
Not a big deal.

101
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,760
Since you recognized me,

102
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,880
why didn't you mention it earlier?

103
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,240
I didn't want to make things awkward.

104
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,480
Given my ties to the Qin family,

105
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,680
things are quite complicated.

106
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,680
Zhou Nanfeng,

107
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,360
why do you always

108
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,600
worry about me?

109
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,040
Always thinking of me?

110
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,360
Why?

111
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,560
Because...

112
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,840
we've known each other
