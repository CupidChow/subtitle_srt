00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:22,300
What do you need them for?

3
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,360
To destroy them.

4
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,680
Trying to cut off my earnings?

5
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:31,820
(Gao Qiang)

6
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,400
If you dare use those photos

7
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,640
to blackmail Qin Zhiyi,

8
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,440
I'll make sure you're jailed.

9
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,280
(Zhou Nanfeng, you're smart,)

10
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,600
(ahead of me.)

11
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:45,200
Before I end up in jail,

12
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,760
I'll send those photos

13
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,520
to her mother.

14
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,640
I dare you.

15
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:57,870
Everyone,

16
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:00,120
(Literature School's Sophomore Welcome)
I think

17
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,200
life's biggest mistake

18
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,440
is missing opportunities.

19
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,600
Let's cherish the present,

20
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,560
and have a future

21
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,000
without regrets, full of sunshine.

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:07,920
Thank you.

(Yunchuan University

24
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,520
Thank you, Qin Zhiyi.

25
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:22,160
Now, let's welcome our teacher
to conclude today's event.

26
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,040
I now declare

27
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,400
the Sophomore Welcome is officially over.

28
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,690
(Get 100,000 in 3 days or it'll go public.)
Thank you.

29
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,120
At tomorrow's speech,

30
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,000
you'll be blackmailed with photos.

31
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:35,520
(Could they really be from the future?)

32
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:40,760
Excuse me.

33
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:42,280
Watch your step!

34
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,680
(I thought I got the photos)

35
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,040
(back from Gao Qiang.)

36
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,080
(How can they still exist?)

37
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,760
(If my mom sees these photos,)

38
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,120
(I'm done for.)

39
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,200
I'll handle this.

40
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,840
Don't worry.

41
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,040
Let me handle it.

42
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,040
Why would you help her?

43
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,120
Because she and I...

44
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,120
Hold on.

45
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,360
Do you all know

46
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,760
who's blackmailing me?

47
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,040
- No idea.
- No idea.

48
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,800
What's wrong with you?

49
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,640
Then what are you doing here?

50
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,240
So annoying.

51
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,600
- But...
- But...

52
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,880
But what?

53
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:43,960
Xingyue.

54
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:49,540
(Song Xingyue)

55
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,200
Zhiyi,

56
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,440
let's go back to the dorm.

57
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,000
Let's go.

58
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,520
(Does Zhong Ziye know this girl?)

59
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,640
Why help Qin Zhiyi?

60
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,680
I enjoy helping others.

61
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,240
Nanfeng, you know that.

62
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,080
See you.

63
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,440
(In college, he didn't know Zhiyi yet.)

64
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,120
(Could it be...)

65
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,000
(Zhou Nanfeng,)

66
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,320
(just you wait.)

67
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:37,040
Let's go, let's go!

68
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,600
Slow down, wait for me.

69
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,000
(Blackmail...)

70
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,280
- Zhiyi.
- (Future boyfriend...)

71
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,160
Those guys just now...

72
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,360
(What's going on?)

73
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,280
Are they your friends?

74
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,520
Zhiyi!

75
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,120
What did you just say?

76
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,120
I said,

77
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,200
- those guys...
- Wait a second,

78
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,840
I need to take this call.

79
00:03:58,860 --> 00:03:59,840
Hello?

80
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,160
Zhiyi.

81
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,760
I know who's been blackmailing you.

82
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,000
Meet me at the school gate.

83
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,120
Hey, are you Zhou Nanfeng?

84
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,840
Come to the KTV near the bar.

85
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,200
Who are you?

86
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,240
Don't worry about that.

87
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,480
If you don't show up,

88
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,280
I'll expose

89
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,000

Get out, get out.

The one blackmailing you

100
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,680
is him.

101
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,760
Stop with the extortion talk.

102

Miss Qin.

109
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,200
He told me to blackmail you.

110
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,160
He wanted me to argue with you

111
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,800
and record it all.

112
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,880
Here, it's all here.

113
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:22,800

Everything's here.

115
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,120
The bar was where I first met you.

116
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,360
How could I plot with you?

117
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,520
Then why are you here?

118
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,720
He told me to come.

119
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,920
Stop wasting time.

120
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,040
I worked for you.

121
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,320
Why can't I call you here?

122
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,600
Miss Qin,

123
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,680
he made me do

124
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,560
all of this.

125
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,480
He is the mastermind.

126
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,520
- It's not my fault.
- I...

127
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,440
Don't breathe a word

128
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,560
about today.

129
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,480
You can leave now.

130
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:51,880
Alright.

131
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,560
You...

132
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,600
Why did you let him go?

133
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,840
The real mastermind

134
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,480
is him.

135
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:06,960
Where's the evidence?

136
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,200
Based on his words alone?

137
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,640
I've looked into you.

138
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,200
You resent the Qin family.

139
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,840
You want them to suffer.

140
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,720
You had a high fever.

141
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,760
Your parents drove against traffic
to save time

142
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:24,880
and then,

143
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,220
collided with the drunk daughter

144
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,240
of Qin's Group's chairman.

145
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,720
Three died instantly.

146
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,000
Only you survived.

147
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,520
(How does he know this much?)

148
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,480
(He must've traveled with me.)

149
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,400
The chairman's daughter?

150
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,770
- You mean...
- Yes,

151
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,320
your mother's biological daughter,

152
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,080
the real Qin Zhiyi.

153
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,400
Yes,

154
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,280
I resent the Qin family,

155
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,480
but revenge never crossed my mind.

156
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,240
I wouldn't harm Yaya.

157
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,440
Today's events

158
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,840
were all your doing.

159
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,040
Why would I plan against you?

160
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,400
Because you want to harm her.

161
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,200
In the future, I'll be her boyfriend.

162
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,520
Why would I ever harm her?

163
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,600
But you...

164
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,600
How could you be her boyfriend?

165
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,760
I'm the one.

166
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,320
(Who's really telling the truth?)

167
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,440
Why set me up?

168
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,520
You ruined my plan.

169
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,800
The real blackmailer of Qin Zhiyi

170
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,560
was bribed by you.

171
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,520
So,

172
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,080
you recreated the blackmail.

173
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,120
For what purpose?

174
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,320
Why pose as her future boyfriend?

175
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,840
What's your aim?

176
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,240
Because I care for her.

177
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,680
I want her away from you.

178
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,720
So,

179
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,040
I can't let you ruin my plan.

180
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,640
Qin Zhiyi is suspicious of you now.

181
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,560
She won't

182
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,480
believe you.

183
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,240
What's really behind the blackmail?

184
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,600
Zhou Nanfeng,
