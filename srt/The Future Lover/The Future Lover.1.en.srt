2
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:23,480
(Xingyue,)

3
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,280
(I'm going to marry Zhong Ziye.)

4
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:27,720
(I've loved him for so long.)

5
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,720
(You'll bless me, right?)

6
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:35,680
(Xingyue,)

7
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,040
(I'll never forget your death.)

8
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,760
(Qin Zhiyi, the murderer, will pay.)

9
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:41,920
(I'll make her suffer)

10
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,320
(in hell.)

11
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:05,720
(Zhou Nanfeng?)

12
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,320
(Why is he here?)

13
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,700
(Zhiyi, wait for me.)

14
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,600
(I saw Yaya at the bar again.)
(I will save you)

15
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,120
(I'll go back earlier in time.)

16
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,640
(Please wait for me.)

17
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,560
Hurry up.

18
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:21,800
(Zhou Nanfeng.)

19
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:22,640
I can't get the fire.

20
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,840
(Nothing you do will work.)

21
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,640
- (Join Qin Zhiyi in the grave.)
- Fire.

22
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:28,760
I need fire now!

23
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,760
(A few years ago)
Are you ready?

24
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,320
Everyone, together!

25
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:55,940
(Zhao Gao)

26
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,960
Wonderful!

27
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:07,650
Bravo!

28
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:10,880
Who are you?

29
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,360
(Qin Zhiyi)
Your grandma, that's who.

30
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,240
- What do you mean?
- Drugging drinks?

31
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,080
How low can you go?

32
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:16,080
You're the low one.

33
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:17,920
Stop arguing!

34
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,280
You're dead!

35
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,120
Rude woman!

36
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:27,180
(Zhou Nanfeng)

37
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,480
Are you okay?

38
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,120
Finally, I see you again.

39
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,160
(Zhiyi,)

40
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,320
(I'll protect you this time.)

41
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,140
(I won't let history repeat itself.)

42
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,120
Luckily, the cut is small.

43
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,680
Thanks a lot.

44
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,920
It's nothing. No need.

45
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,460
I was wondering did you mistake me

46
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,960
for someone else?

47
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,000
No.

48
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,720
I didn't.

49
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,040
But we haven't met before.

50
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,280
Why did you say

51
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,840
"Finally, I see you again"?

52
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,200
I'm Zhou Nanfeng.

53
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,840
I'm from the future.

54
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,160
I...

55
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,680
(I must get close to her)

56
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,600
(and uncover what happened back then.)

57
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,480
I'm your future boyfriend.

58
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:22,960
(Zhong Ziye)

59
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,920
(Zhou Nanfeng,)

60
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,050
(didn't expect this, huh?)

61
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:25,960
(I'm here too.)

62
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,320
Hey,

63
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,400
- that's so old-fashioned.
- No.

64
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,720
Even kids don't use that in kindergarten.

65
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,120
I mean it, it's true.

66
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,120
You're Qin Zhiyi.

67
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,560
Do you know me?

68
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,840
Since childhood, your mom

69
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,200
controlled you harshly.

70
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,400
Whenever you make mistakes,

71
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,880
she'd punish herself

72
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,560
to force you to obey.

73
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,760
So to release your inner tension,

74
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,600
you come here every Wednesday

75
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,360
to perform under your real name.

76
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,080
- Yaya.
- No one knows this.

77
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,520
How do you...

78
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,240
You investigated me.

79
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,400
I didn't.

80
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,560
I'm truly from the future.

81
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,680
You're lying again.

82
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:08,960
I...

83
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,000
(Student Card)
Zhou Nanfeng.

84
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,720
We're from the same school.

85
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,000
I've got my eye on you.

86
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,000
If you dare tell anyone about today,

87
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,400
I won't let you off easy.

88
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,160
What the heck?

89
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,360
Liar.

90
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:39,600
Trying to escape?

91
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,840
Fancy seeing you again.

92
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,220
Don't think you're off the hook

93
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,720
because someone took the hit for you.

94
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,640
You got that lady out of here,

95
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,960
so now you'll play with us.

96
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,600
Just for fun.

97
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,280
Oh crap!

98
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:00,720
Boss.

99
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,000
Are you okay?

100
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,120
Get him!

101
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,960
Are you looking for trouble?

102
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,760
- Run!
- Chase them!

103
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,800
- Let's go!
- Okay.

104
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,080
Mom,

105
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,320
I'll be home soon.

106
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,500
(A few months ago)

107
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:32,920
Put it down.

108
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,800
(It's him.)

109
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:03,880
- Go!
- Don't run!

110
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:04,720
This way.

111
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,520
Where are they?

112
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,640
Over there.

113
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,520
Let's go.

114
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,000
Yes, I remember back then...

115
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,320
- Thanks.
- No problem.

116
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,160
Let's go.

117
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,560
Thank you.

118
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,760
You...

119
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:34,720
(Zhou Nanfeng,)

120
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,480
(I won't let you save Qin Zhiyi this time.)

121
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,680
I finally see you, Zhiyi.

122
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,120
I've missed you so much.

123
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,840
Hey.

124
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,760
Hey.

125
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,200
Did you

126
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,240
mistake me for someone?

127
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:49,800
In the future,

128
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
you're my girlfriend.

129
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,880
How could I mistake you?

130
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,920
Maybe these words

131
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:58,800
sound a bit crazy,

132
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,560
but I'm really from the future.

133
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,570
I even know

134
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,920
some things about you, Zhiyi.

135
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,400
For example,

136
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,280
after I saved you,

137
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,400
you've been wanting to find me.

138
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:10,920
(This matter,)

139
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,720
(I've never told anyone.)

140
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,240
Zhiyi,

141
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,920
since we like each other,

142
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,200
how about

143
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,600
we start dating now?

144
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:23,100
(Zhixing Building)

145
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,600
How did we get together?

146
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,920
I pursued you.

147
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,600
How long have we been together?

148
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,500
- Six months.
- Then you...

149
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,960
Aren't you tired of sitting straight?

150
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:31,920
In front of me,

151
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,840
you can be yourself.

152
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,160
Zhiyi, why so many questions?

153
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,280
Do you not believe me?

154
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,160
At tomorrow's speech,

155
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,680
you'll be blackmailed with photos.

156
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,800
(How are they together?)

157
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:01,920
Where are the photos?

158
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,520
What do you need them for?

159
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,120
(Zhou Nanfeng, you're smart,)

160
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,440
