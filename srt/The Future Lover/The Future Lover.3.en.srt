2
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,840
Stop crying. It's disturbing my sleep.

3
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:35,280
My parents are gone.

4
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,240
It's all my fault.

5
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,240
Will you cry forever?

6
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,720
They can't come back.

7
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:51,200
I mean, if you stop crying,

8
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,720
they'll come find you.

9
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,000
Really?

10
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:57,110
Yes, really.

11
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,480
Matron said if I stay happy,

12
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,800
my mom and dad will come someday.

13
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,720
Where are they then?

14
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,200
I've never seen them.

15
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,560
I'm Yaya. What's your name?

16
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:08,570
I'm...

17
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:09,680
Ms. Qin,

18
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,680
look at this child.

19
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:11,980
Does she look like your daughter?

20
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:13,360
Yes.

21
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,720
So much.

22
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,520
Hey, kiddo.

23
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,200
Come home with me.

24
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:25,760
I'll be your mom

25
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,040
and care for you.

26
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,000
Sounds good?

27
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,360
Okay.

28
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,160
Zhou Nanfeng.

29
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:41,880
You're here.

30
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,080
Looking for me?

31
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:46,760
Why stand there?

32
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,040
Come over.

33
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,280
You said...

34
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,280
we're together

35
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,920
after you confessed.

36
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,840
Yes.

37
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,920
You said...

38
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,360
we've been together

39
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,520
for many years.

40
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,280
Yes.

41
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,680
So why are you

42
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,400
so nervous?

43
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,520
I...

44
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,640
I'm not.

45
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,080
Really?

46
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,880
But you're acting

47
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,440
like a stranger.

48
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,520
Sorry.

49
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:54,160
What's your goal?

50
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,520
I have no goal.

51
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,880
I just don't want you
to be with Zhong Ziye.

52
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,120
He could harm you.

53
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,920
But you already lied to me.

54
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,320
How can I trust you?

55
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,200
Yaya, I...

56
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,580
You have no right to call me that.

57
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,360
All these years,

58
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,360
you're the first who told me

59
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,880
I could be myself.

60
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,280
Yet you're a liar.

61
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,240
It's not like that, I...

62
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,480
Stay away from me from now on.

63
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,360
I really dislike those

64
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,400
who deceive me

65
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,760
claiming it's for my good.

66
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,000
Keep your distance from Zhong Ziye.

67
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,520
Surveillance footage,

68
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,520
can you give it to me?

69
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,720
Half a million.

70
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,880
What?

71
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,760
I've helped you blackmail Qin Zhiyi.

72
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,680
And I've been scraping money...

73
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,440
300,000.

74
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,080
This USB drive

75
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,520
had the footage of you spiking drinks.

76
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:12,960
Want me

77
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,680
to send it to your wife,

78
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,520
or your daughter?

79
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,600
Fine. 500,000.

80
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,640
Tomorrow.

81
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,680
No way. How is it possible?

82
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,280
I need time to gather money.

83
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,520
Tomorrow.

84
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,840
Fine.

85
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:47,840
Screw you.

86
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,200
Zhong Ziye, your dad's cut you off.

87
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,440
How dare you hit me?

88
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,480
Can you handle it?

89
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,480
Can you afford it?

90
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,240
Don't bully him. Apologize.

91
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,800
No, I won't!

92
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,960
- No.
- Dad.

93
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,520
You brat, bullying my girl?

94
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,360
Run!

95
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,480
I'm Song Xingyue. What's your name?

96
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,680
I'm Zhong Ziye.

97
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,000
Hey.

98
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,440
Hey.

99
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,280
Hey, wake up.

100
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,640
Xingyue.

101
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,160
Give me more time.

102
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,560
I need to fix all the issues.

103
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,160
Why don't you

104
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,160
go back to the dorm?

105
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,440
We have class soon.

106
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,640
Zhong Ziye.

107
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,440
Zhiyi.

108
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,760
Xingyue.

109
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,960
Zhiyi, I have an urgent matter.

110
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,320
Please cover for me.

111
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,560
Okay.

112
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:58,800
Hurry.

113
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,120
I win.

114
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,760
Why didn't you pay the fees?

115
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,140
Where's my mom's medical fees?

116
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,320
Can't you see I'm busy?

117
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,370
Put it aside now.

118
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,720
That's my mom's life-saving money.

119
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,640
Give me the money.

120
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,880
Asking me for money here.

121
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,640
I've lost enough!

122
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:14,800
Get out!

123
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,120
Keep going.

124
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,080
Give me the money.

125
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,960
- Give it to me!
- You...

126
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,000
You're so annoying.

127
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,160
Money, money, always money.

128
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,760
Since you and your mom moved in,

129
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,480
I haven't had a happy day.

130
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,160
Your mom didn't even give me a kid,

131
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,400
and now she's in the hospital!

132
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,880
Your mom's such a jinx.

133
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,960
Your late dad

134
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,280
was made miserable by her too.

135
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,360
Alright,

136
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,400
it's fine.

137
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,560
Let's keep playing.

138
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,360
Keep playing.

139
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,160
Deal the cards.

140
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,480
Give me the money. I'll leave.

141
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,120
Give me the money. I'll leave.

142
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,360
Fine, take it.

143
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,200
Here, take it.

144
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,440
It's not enough.

145
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,080
Are you done yet?

146
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:11,040
Keep bothering me,

147
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,160
and you'll get nothing!

148
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,360
Easy, easy. Just go.

149
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,640
Let's continue.

150
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:20,800
Ignore her.

151
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,360
All she wants is money.

152
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,620
Besides asking for money,

153
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:25,360
she's useless.

154
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,780
(Registration fee)

155
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,400
Hello.

156
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,200
Um, I...

157
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,400
I don't have enough money.

158
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,800
Can you give me a few more days?

159
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,160
Your mom's bills

160
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,160
are already been paid.

161
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,000
Been paid?

162
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,400
Yes.

163
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,200
Who paid them?

164
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,080
I have no idea.

165
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,040
Maybe a friend of yours

166
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,480
or a friend of your mom's.

167
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,480
Thanks.

168
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,200
Please check for me.

169
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,640
Don't come here again.

170
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,840
Your mom's bills

171
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,600
was paid by some shady person.

172
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,960
Have some dignity.

173
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,960
You may not care, but I do.

174
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,080
You're like your mom,

175
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,240
always causing trouble.

176
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,200
Bad luck person.

177
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,270
Get lost!

178
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,320
Get far away.

179
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:19,760
Come on, come on.

180
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,600
Who's turn to play?

181
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:25,920
Him.

182
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,680
Who's this guy?

183
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,320
