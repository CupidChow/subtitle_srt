2
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,400
(Yaya,)

3
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,440
(maybe Zhou Nanfeng is right.)

4
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,080
(I shouldn't have)

5
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,040
(forced it all on you.)

6
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,320
(It's time to let it go.)

7
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:01,840
Mom,

8
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,600
how are you doing?

9
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:06,920
Yaya,

10
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,240
I'm sorry.

11
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,720
You'll always be my mom.

12
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,400
And you'll always be my daughter.

13
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,480
Thank you.

14
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,280
Without you,

15
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:40,960
I wouldn't have realized

16
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,240
I was hurting Yaya.

17
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,600
I can't forgive myself.

18
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,200
Let's put forgiveness aside.

19
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,360
Whether it's guilt

20
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,880
or cherished memories,

21
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,640
it's all in the past.

22
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,240
As long as you and Yaya

23
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,720
can be together happily.

24
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,320
That's what matters.

25
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,240
Please take good care of Yaya.

26
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,040
I'm counting on you.

27
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,200
I will.

28
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,360
You guys go ahead.

29
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,040
Go wherever you want.

30
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,480
Do whatever you desire.

31
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,120
Remember to visit me often.

32
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,240
Why?

33
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,520
Why?

34
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,840
Why?

35
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,680
If it weren't

36
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,800
for you letting her

37
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,800
trick me,

38
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,320
I wouldn't have acted against her.

39
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,480
You want to help her,

40
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,560
but you failed to protect her.

41
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,520
Now, you're the ones

42
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,800
who caused her death.

43
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,480
It's you guys!

44
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,320
I want to change something,

45
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,590
so no matter

46
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,800
what the outcome is,

47
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,840
we will handle it.

48
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,000
(It's all because of Qin Zhiyi.)

49
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,520
(She insisted on changing the end,)

50
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,360
(which led to this situation)

51
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,960
(and Xingyue's death.)

52
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,520
It's all my fault.

53
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:20,040
I insisted on changing the end.

54
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,680
That's why Xingyue died.

55
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,720
I'm sorry, Xingyue.

56
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,240
It's not your fault.

57
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,440
It's Gao Qiang's.

58
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,680
Here's a news update.

59
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,130
The suspect in the recent home murder case

60
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:36,490
has been identified.

61
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,480
He's a first-year at Yunchuan University,

62
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,320
Zhong Ziye.

63
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,720
Anyone with info,
please contact the police.

64
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,200
How did this happen?

65
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,920
This is so creepy.

66
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,080
Check out this news.

67
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:12,000
(Yaya,)

68
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,120
(no matter what,)

69
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,880
(I'll stay with you.)

70
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,920
What should we eat later?

71
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,240
Noodles.

72
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,080
Zhiyi,

73
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:21,960
I want to take more pictures of you.

74
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,250
Let's take some together.

75
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,480
There's been a murder!

76
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,680
Let's get out of here!

77
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,680
Qin Zhiyi,

78
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,440
Song Xingyue died twice because of you.

79
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,560
You deserve this.

80
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,560
You really deserve it.

81
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,840
Zhiyi.

82
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,520
Zhiyi!

83
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,720
Zhiyi.

84
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,440
Zhiyi.

85
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,360
Zhiyi.

86
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,040
Zhiyi.

87
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:58,520
Zhiyi...

88
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,160
No.

89
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:04,880
Don't.

90
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,720
Zhiyi.

91
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,840
Zhiyi.

92
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,320
Zhong Ziye.

93
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,600
Zhong Ziye!

94
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,800
It's all her fault.

95
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,040
She deserves it.

96
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,480
She deserves it!

97
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,720
Zhiyi.

98
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,080
Yaya.

99
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,160
Yaya!

100
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:06,500
(Zhong Ziye was punished by law.)

101
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:08,340
(Suspect Gao Qiang died despite rescue.)

102
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:17,110
(I've returned to my space-time.)

103
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,680
(I'm back again.)

104
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,520
(Zhou Nanfeng,)

105
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,040
(I think I understand now.)

106
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,160
(So that's how it is.)

107
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,760
(I get it too.)

108
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,960
(We can't change others,)

109
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,800
(but ourselves.)

110
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,360
(Zhou Nanfeng,)

111
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,920
(we all need to be well.)

112
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,680
Qin Zhiyi,

113
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,560
let's cherish the present.

114
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,990
Keep moving forward.

115
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,320
The past is behind you.

116
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:52,460
(Many years later)

117
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,520
I miss you so much.

118
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,120
Are you well in another space-time?

119
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,840
Zhou Nanfeng.

120
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,080
Zhou Nanfeng.

121
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:06,580
(Old Zhou Nanfeng)

122
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:11,140
(When I looked back,)

123
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,560
(everything that happened then)

124
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,360
(felt like a dream.)

125
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,320
(I'm still unsure)

126
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,840
(if it truly happened.)

127
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,400
(But no matter what,)

128
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,480
(I always believe)

129
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,240
(as the sun sets,)

130
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,720
(there's moonlight,)

131
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,880
(and when moonlight fades,)

132
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,680
(there's sunrise.)

133
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,160
(The path ahead is long.)

134
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,440
(Life is full of regrets,)

135
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,240
(yet it is all worthwhile.)

136
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,240
(Everything happens)

137
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,640
