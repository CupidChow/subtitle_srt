2
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:28,920
Nice shot! Well played!

3
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:30,600
Zhong Ziye.

4
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:33,040
(Why is she here?)

5
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:34,920
Zhiyi.

6
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:39,480
Zhiyi, why are you here?

7
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,920
Last time you blocked a shot for me,

8
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:42,840
so I came to thank you.

9
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:44,560
You're too kind, Zhiyi.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,120
It's nothing, really.

11
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,600
Sorry, I apologize.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,560
Maybe you should rinse it off?

13
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,840
The sticky coffee
will make you uncomfortable.

14
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,240
I'll wait outside.

15
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:56,800
Alright.

16
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,120
Nice!

17
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:03,320
(If he really took those blackmail pics,)

18
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,880
(there must be clues on his phone.)

19
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,200
Who's there?

20
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:02,280
(Enter Password)

21
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,220
(Locked. Retry in 30s.)

22
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,240
Who took my phone?

23
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:11,980
(Locked. Retry in 6s.)

24
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,320
Who's there?

25
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,560
It's okay.

26
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:07,160
Shh.

27
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,800
What are you doing?

28
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,800
Don't take off your clothes.

29
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:17,720
Don't.

30
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:42,880
Who's there?

31
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,360
What's wrong?

32
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,880
Why are you here?

33
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,240
Can't I shower after a workout?

34
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:55,960
Is there a problem?

35
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,040
My phone is missing.

36
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,720
Mind if I check?

37
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,160
No way.

38
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,200
If you think I took your phone,

39
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,720
you can call the police.

40
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,040
If you open this door,

41
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,960
I'll report you for harassing me.

42
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,920
Put your clothes on.

43
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,720
I just stepped into the shower.

44
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:21,680
Fine.

45
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,120
To blackmail Qin Zhiyi again?

46
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,040
Here's 100,000.

47
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,280
Why don't you do it yourself?

48
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,320
200,000.

49
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,760
Someone might approach you soon.

50
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,480
No matter what he says,

51
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,640
don't believe him.

52
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,760
He could put you in danger.

53
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,080
Who are you really?

54
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,240
Why me?

55
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,760
Who I am isn't crucial.

56
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,480
What's important is

57
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,800
I know you need money.

58
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,480
You owe a lot in gambling debt.

59
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,480
500,000.

60
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:57,880
But...

61
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,000
Don't worry about what Zhou Nanfeng said.

62
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,320
You won't go to jail.

63
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,280
Everything you said

64
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,400
is recorded on this pen.

65
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,240
We're in this together now.

66
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,280
Alright, fine.

67
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:40,880
(Why force me to extort Qin Zhiyi
at the Ghost Building?)

68
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,080
(I'm not that naive.)

69
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,920
What to eat later?

70
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,040
Let's check the cafeteria.

71
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:47,880
Song Xingyue.

72
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,680
Song Xingyue.

73
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,600
You go ahead.

74
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,720
What are you doing here?

75
00:06:59,040 --> 00:06:59,920
I need to talk to you.

76
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,720
Should I say it here?

77
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:09,800
Come with me.

78
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,040
I put the phone back.

79
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,040
Don't worry.

80
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,280
Thanks.

81
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:27,960
Back then,

82
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,960
why were you there?

83
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,040
I saw you at the basketball court.

84
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,000
I felt it was risky, so I followed.

85
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,440
Glad you were there then.

86
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,680
Otherwise,

87
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,360
things would've been tricky.

88
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:43,960
What really happened?

89
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:47,960
Actually,

90
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,960
I got another

91
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,280
blackmail message.

92
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:54,920
Another one?

93
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,760
How could this be?

94
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:01,760
Do you think

95
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,920
could it be

96
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,600
Zhong Ziye?

97
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,320
It's not him,

98
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,120
but it's related to him.

99
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,360
What do you mean?

100
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,520
- It...
- Shouldn't you ask me first

101
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,960
