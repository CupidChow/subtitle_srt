2
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,560
Cut the crap. Move!

3
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,720
Let me go!

4
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,200
Let go!

5
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,080
Let me go.

6
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,040
Mom.

7
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,600
I've met Zhong Ziye.

8
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:33,720
You know, that guy.

9
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:34,720
When we were kids,

10
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,040
he always followed me around.

11
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,920
You remember, right?

12
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:40,720
He's now

13
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,720
grown up.

14
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,120
He also got into college.

15
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:47,820
But...

16
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:50,820
he seems to be
going through something lately.

17
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,260
But he won't tell me.

18
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:55,580
Mom,

19
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:58,620
what should I do?

20
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:11,260
Gao Qiang.

21
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:19,500
Gao Qiang.

22
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,320
Hello?

23
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,140
Zhong Ziye,

24
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:34,780
what are you trying to do?

25
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:36,500
You're good at dodging.

26
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:41,890
(Zhiyi: Gao & Zhong
at Ghost Building. Hurry!)

27
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,300
Leave Zhiyi.

28
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:46,820
Set your terms.

29
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:48,980
I won't leave her.

30
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:50,300
Give me back my phone.

31
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:52,340
Your parents caused her sister's death.

32
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:54,180
Are you fit to be with her?

33
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:56,820
It was just an accident.

34
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:59,420
You lost your daughter,
and I lost my parents.

35
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:00,980
Why is it my parents' fault?

36
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:02,940
Besides,

37
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,340
Yaya is her own person.

38
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,820
It's her right to choose

39
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:07,220
who she wants to be with.

40
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:09,940
There's no Yaya.

41
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:11,980
In this world, she is just my daughter,

42
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:13,260
Qin Zhiyi.

43
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,420
Yaya is fine.

44
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:18,940
Qin Zhiyi is fine too.

45
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:20,740
Who she wants to become

46
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:22,620
is her decision alone.

47
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:25,020
No one can interfere.

48
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,220
It's not your place to teach me.

49
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:28,620
Leave Zhiyi.

50
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:31,140
Otherwise, your future will be ruined.

51
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:34,180
Then come at me.

52
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:37,380
Anyway, I won't leave her.

53
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:43,580
Ms. Qin, I'll go after him.

54
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:44,900
No need.

55
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,050
Have Secretary Wang
find the College Director.

56
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:49,020
Make this boy suffer a bit.

57
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,390
(Gao & Zhong
at Ghost Building. Hurry!)

58
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:59,020
You killed Gao Qiang.

59
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:00,700
Yes.

60
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:04,660
Because he deserved to die.

61
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:06,980
Now it's your turn.

62
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:10,140
Why do you want me dead?

63
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:11,460
What really

64
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:13,060
happened to Xingyue?

65
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:15,030
Don't mention her. You don't deserve it.

66
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:18,300
Before I went back in time,

67
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,460
Gao Qiang blackmailed you.

68
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,420
He even went to school to get money.

69
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:26,300
He threatened to make the photos public.

70
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:27,620
So your mother would know.

71
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:30,380
Later,

72
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,660
- Get out!
- you realized

73
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:33,340
- Out!
- he'd always been hurting her.

74
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:37,100
You wanted to
take down Gao Qiang with her.

75
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:39,220
- Xingyue.
- Do you want to take revenge?

76
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:43,100
It's you.

77
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:44,820
You hadn't handled your own stuff.

78
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,820
So you asked Xingyue to confront Gao Qiang.

79
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,820
That night,

80
00:04:58,540 --> 00:04:59,920
Song Xingyue was blindly

81
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,460
following your plan,

82
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:03,580
drugging him to leave him vulnerable,

83
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:05,180
then taking him to the Ghost Building

84
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:06,820
to push him down.

85
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:08,660
Song Xingyue thought she could

86
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:10,500
perfectly shake off Gao Qiang's grip.

87
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,700
(Qin Zhiyi)
But

88
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:13,860
she didn't anticipate

89
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:16,340
you faced unexpected issues that night.

90
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:17,770
Hello, who is that?

91
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:21,300
Miss Qin, what can I do for you?

92
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,500
Ten million.

93
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:27,020
Okay, okay.

94
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,700
I'll be there soon.

95
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:31,980
But that night

96
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,140
you didn't show up at all.

97
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:36,660
Miss Qin.

98
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:39,020
Miss Qin.

99
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:41,780
Where are you?

100
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:46,620
But how could Gao Qiang
be so easy to deal with?

101
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:50,140
Song Xingyue waited for you long.

102
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:52,820
But you didn't respond at all.

103
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,180
The moment before

104
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:56,740
she decided to act on her own,

105
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:58,820
Gao Qiang regained his senses.

106
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,140
He shoved Song Xingyue off the building.

107
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:04,780
She died on the spot.

108
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:07,260
Why are you

109
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,340
following me late at night?

110
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:11,460
What's with that brick?

111
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:12,700
You...

112
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:13,900
What are you doing?

113
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,380
Why are you following me?

114
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:16,400
I support your life.

115
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,780
- Let go!
- What do you want?

116
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,420
What's wrong with you.

117
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,220
Song Xingyue...

118
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:32,500
Song Xingyue!

119
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,700
To hide the death, Gao Qiang

120
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,420
directly burned her to ashes.

121
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:52,820
If you had been there,

122
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:54,220
how could she end up like that?

123
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:55,700
No way.

124
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:57,480
I haven't experienced it.

125
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,420
Why should I trust you?

126
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:00,020
And I wouldn't leave Xingyue alone.

127
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:00,940
No,

128
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:02,820
you wouldn't.

129
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:05,300
But your mom stopped you back then.

130
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:07,300
Then are you innocent?

131
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:10,220
Everything happened because of you.

132
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:13,820
I planned to

133
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:15,780
confess my love to Xingyue on my birthday.

134
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:16,980
Because of you,

135
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:24,900
she died the day before my birthday!
