2
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,680
I planned to confess my love

3
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:26,760
to Xingyue on my birthday.
Because of you,

4
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:36,080
she died the day before my birthday!

5
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,200
So many details,

6
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,080
how do you know them so well?

7
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,760
You told me everything.

8
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,920
You were closest to Xingyue back then.

9
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,560
When she disappeared, you transferred.

10
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,040
That's why I suspected

11
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,680
you were linked to her death.

12
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,360
I joined Qin's Group,

13
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,800
trying every way to become

14
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,560
Qin Yu's ideal son-in-law.

15
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,520
Finally,

16
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,320
on the day before our wedding,

17
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,000
I got the truth out of you.

18
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,240
If that's the case...

19
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,840
If it weren't for you,

20
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,200
Xingyue would've been there

21
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,080
when her mom woke up.

22
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,840
Maybe they'd get away from Gao Qiang

23
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,440
and live happily.

24
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,160
Sir, can you go any faster?

25
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,920
We're already at max speed.

26
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,720
What...

27
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,920
What's happening?

28
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,200
The car seems to have broken down.

29
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:54,440
What's wrong now?

30
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,840
Not sure what's broken.

31
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,240
Here you go.

32
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,040
Hey, young man.

33
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,120
Hello, police?

34
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,720
Murder in the Ghost Building.

35
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,160
Hurry over!

36
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,640
Impossible,

37
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,000
this can't be true.

38
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,400
So you...

39
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,960
must pay too.

40
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,760
Zhong Ziye,

41
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,640
stay back.

42
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,600
What now?

43
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,600
Let's talk it out.

44
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,280
- Stab me?
- Don't be rash.

45
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:43,370
Come on.

46
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,320
You dare?

47
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,720
Don't move, stay back!

48
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,640
Stab me.

49
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,560
You dare?

50
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,840
- Stab me!
- Stay back!

51
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,240
Zhong Ziye.

52
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,360
Wake up!

53
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,120
Wake up, Zhong Ziye!

54
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,720
Zhong Ziye.

55
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,920
Wake up, Zhong Ziye.

56
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,080
Zhong Ziye...

57
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,560
I'm sorry.

58
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,480
Sorry, I'm late.

59
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,720
I killed him.

60
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,280
I... I really didn't mean it.

61
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,920
I truly didn't want to harm him.

62
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,520
(How could Yaya be the culprit?)

63
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,170
- (What's going on?)
- I didn't mean it.

64
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:31,550
I know, I know.

65
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,040
What should we do?

66
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,480
Listen to me, listen.

67
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,040
It's alright.

68
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,560
I can save him.

69
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,040
Let's go back in time.

70
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,280
- It'll be fine.
- Back in time?

71
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,000
Take me with you, alright?

72
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,120
Sure.

73
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,360
Let's go.

74
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,920
On Sep 20th,

75
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,640
Yaya

76
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,520
accidentally killed Zhong Ziye.

77
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,760
She was taken away.

78
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,680
As a witness,

79
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,160
I was detained.

80
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,200
It's been days now.

81
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,120
Yaya's still at the station.

82
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,720
I want to help her.

83
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,360
Leave Zhiyi.

84
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,640
So,

85
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,600
you should pay too.

86
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,320
Zhou Nanfeng, your hand...

87
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,360
It's fine.

88
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,440
Why's it you again?

89
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,280
Didn't Qin Yu stop you?

90
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:09,840
Is Qin Yu part of your plan?

91
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:10,760
Yes.

92
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:12,480
I knew she was probing you,

93
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,480
so I chose a day she'd meet you,

94
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,480
but you still showed up.

95
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,400
Zhong Ziye,

96
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,840
it's time to stop.

97
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,120
The police are on their way.

98
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,520
You can still turn yourself in.

99
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,160
I can't.

100
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,720
I can't get caught.

101
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,200
Zhong Ziye!

102
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:33,800
It's your turn.

103
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,720
Alright.

104
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,800
Why are you here?

105
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,480
Where are you taking me?

106
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,320
What's wrong?

107
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,080
Zhong Ziye!

108
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,120
Why are you taking Xingyue?

109
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,440
What's going on?

110
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,840
What's happening?

111
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,520
- Zhong Ziye!
- Open the door, Zhong Ziye!

112
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,080
- Zhong Ziye!
- Open up!

113
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,000
Unlock the door!

114
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,480
Zhong Ziye!

115
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,040
I'll find the tools, you stay here.

116
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:09,960
Okay.

117
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:12,690
- Stay safe.
- Alright.

118
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:13,880
Zhong Ziye!

119
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,530
Zhong Ziye.

120
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,320
Why did you bring me here?

121
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,800
Why are they chasing you?

122
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,200
What's happening?

123
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:24,660
Xingyue,

124
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:28,220
no one will bully you anymore.

125
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:30,580
What do you mean?

126
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:31,980
Gao Qiang's gone.

127
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,140
Gao Qiang?

128
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:36,580
Gone?

129
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:40,140
How did he die?

130
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:45,230
I killed him.
