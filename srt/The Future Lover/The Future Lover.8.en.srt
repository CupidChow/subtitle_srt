=The Future Lover=
=Episode 8=

2
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,160
Xingyue's stepfather is Gao Qiang.

3
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:27,520
And Gao Qiang

4
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,200
is the one blackmailing you.

5
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,040
It's likely Gao Qiang

6
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,160
who called Xingyue today.

7
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:35,640
Gao Qiang?

8
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,560
Xingyue's stepfather?

9
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,320
I don't know him.

10
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,360
Why would he extort me?

11
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,600
For money.

12
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,520
Gao Qiang loves gambling.

13
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,360
He owes a lot of money.

14
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,280
Oh,

15
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,760
he drove for your family for two weeks.

16
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,960
He knows your relationship with your mom.

17
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:56,800
So he

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,640
hopes to extort a big sum of money.

19
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,680
So,

20
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,680
if today,

21
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,640
you and Xingyue hadn't been there,

22
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:05,960
the people hit by the board

23
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,480
were to be Gao Qiang and me.

24
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,640
That's right.

25
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,600
But Gao Qiang was blackmailing me.

26
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,080
Why did Zhong Ziye want him dead?

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,160
Because Gao Qiang

28
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,000
was terrible to Song Xingyue,

29
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,720
always hurting and insulting her.

30
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,960
Zhong Ziye saw a chance

31
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,640
to remove Gao Qiang

32
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,560
who hurt Song Xingyue,

33
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,920
as well as...

34
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,160
you who got misunderstood.

35
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,160
Then he could get away with it.

36
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,760
That was his goal, right?

37
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,440
Didn't expect

38
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,840
Xingyue's life was so harsh.

39
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,320
I always saw her smiling.

40
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:54,570
- I thought...
- Zhiyi.

41
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,200
Xingyue, are you okay?

42
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,440
I'm fine.

43
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,720
Zhong Ziye isn't here.

44
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,160
Wasn't he

45
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,560
always with you?

46
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,000
He's gone.

47
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,120
I thought he went to you.

48
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,080
By the way,

49
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,000
today,

50
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,200
why were you

51
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,080
there anyway?

52
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,280
You don't know what happened?

53
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,560
Gao Qiang

54
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,760
only told me to go there,

55
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:23,360
but he didn't say why.

56
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,480
So,

57
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,120
what actually happened?

58
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,720
Xingyue,

59
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,520
no matter what happens,

60
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,960
you must come to us.

61
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,120
Yeah,

62
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,800
about today's events,

63
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,360
don't worry.

64
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,720
We'll handle it.

65
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,790
But...

66
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,330
Xingyue,

67
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,520
take care of yourself.

68
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,920
Let's go.

69
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,400
Zhiyi.

70
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,080
Zhong Ziye...

71
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,160
I know what you want to ask.

72
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,360
About Zhong Ziye and me,

73
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,480
it's complicated.

74
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,160
But I know

75
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,120
he doesn't like me.

76
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,320
Why not tell her the truth?

77
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,760
You said

78
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,520
Gao Qiang treats her poorly.

79
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,400
It shows her life

80
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,680
isn't as bright as it seems.

81
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,120
Let's try to

82
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,360
reduce her troubles.

83
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,960
First, find Zhong Ziye.

84
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,600
Alright.

85
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,160
You rascal.

86
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,480
What are you up to?

87
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,480
Let me go. I don't want the money.

88
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,480
It's your fault

89
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:10,080
to involve Song Xingyue.

90
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,840
I changed my original plan.

91
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,320
What's wrong with asking my daughter?

92
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,360
What's wrong?

93
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,680
The board collapsed anyway.

94
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,080
If I went there,

95
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,440
I would've been crushed.

96
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,360
Exactly.

97
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,520
Why weren't you crushed?

98
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,520
Did you tamper with it?

99
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,600
What's your plan?

100
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,200
I'm warning you.

101
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,320
I've got

102
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,360
your recording.

103
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,040
Is this

104
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,680
what you mentioned?

105
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,600
How did you get it?

106
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,920
I hid it well.

107
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,800
If I dared give it to you,

108
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:05,920
I could retrieve it

109
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,600
whenever needed.

110
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,200
Now I understand,

111
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,280
since the beginning,

112
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,040
you planned against me,

113
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,040
gave money, and made me extort Qin Zhiyi.

114
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,600
Why set me up?

115
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:31,880
Why betray me?

116
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,800
Was it Song Xingyue?

117
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,680
Did Song Xingyue order this?

118
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,440
I knew it.

119
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:50,000
She seems gentle,

120
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,400
but hides deceit.

121
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,200
It's me who wanted to hurt you.

122
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,320
You made Song Xingyue suffer.

123
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,990
You'll repay it a thousand times.

124
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,160
Zhong Ziye is missing.

125
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,200
Gao Qiang disappeared too.

126
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,480
Gao Qiang forced Song Xingyue

127
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,600
to the Ghost Building.

128
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,200
It ruined Zhong Ziye's plan

129
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,600
and put Song Xingyue in danger.

130
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,120
So Zhong Ziye got furious

131
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,080
and took Gao Qiang away.

132
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,160
Zhong Ziye is extremely dangerous now.

133
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,200
No matter what you do next,

134
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,600
don't act on your own.

135
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,520
Always tell me first.

136
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,640
- I'll go with you.
- Okay.

137
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,080
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

138
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,680
- Apologies.
- It's fine.

139
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,000
Is the wound reopening?

140
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,440
I'm fine. Let's think first

141
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,080
where Zhong Ziye would take Gao Qiang to.

142
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,840
Let's go.

143
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,400
You figured it out.

144
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,920
Change the bandage first.

145
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,680
Stop hitting me.

146
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,440
You know it hurts, right?

147
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,760
What are you doing?

148
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,520
Let me go.

149
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,560
Let go, let go, release me.

150
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,040
Do you know why I brought you here?

151
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,560
This is where

152
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,080
you pushed Xingyue.

153
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,520
Push?

154
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,560
I... I didn't do that.

155
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,520
I've never been here.

156
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,160
Never been here, never.

157
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,080
Scared now?

158
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,840
