2
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:24,160
Xingyue!

3
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:25,640
Xingyue!

4
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:27,520
Move aside!

5
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,840
Xingyue...

6
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:57,880
Xingyue...

7
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:00,880
Didn't you agree

8
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,320
we'd meet tomorrow?

9
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:06,560
Why?

10
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:10,560
Why?

11
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:22,840
How did she

12
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,680
fall from the rooftop?

13
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,600
I saw her

14
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,120
with that man on the rooftop,

15
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,440
arguing about checking out.

16
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,640
Could it be...

17
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,200
What did you say?

18
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,520
Who was it?

19
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,720
A middle-aged man,

20
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,440
pulling the girl upstairs,

21
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,760
and arguing about discharge.

22
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,240
Feels like her family.

23
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,840
Why?

24
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,320
Why, why?

25
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,440
Why kill Xingyue?

26
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,400
Why?

27
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,520
Stop.

28
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,360
I will tell you.

29
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,160
I will tell you.

30
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,720
You, that guy today,

31
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,000
and Qin Zhiyi

32
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,760
are in cahoots, right?

33
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,640
You pushed me to extort Qin Zhiyi,

34
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,560
just to send me behind bars.

35
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,320
Nice plan, huh?

36
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,560
What are you saying?

37
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,800
I don't know.

38
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,160
Don't you?

39
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,680
I saw it all.

40
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,520
I saw it!

41
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,440
Are you still denying it?

42
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,240
If you don't admit it,

43
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,760
I'll push you down.

44
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,410
Screw you!

45
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,840
You belong in jail.

46
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,320
You finally confessed.

47
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,320
You stubborn girl!

48
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,800
I raised you for nothing!

49
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,640
Without me,

50
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,000
you and your mom would've starved.

51
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,840
When did you ever support me?

52
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,560
You promised my mom before your marriage

53
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,600
that you'd treat us well.

54
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,720
And what happened?

55
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,080
In less than six months,

56
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,800
your true self showed.

57
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,720
You upset my mom so much

58
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,840
that she had a stroke.

59
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,800
Now she can't even get up.

60
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,040
My living expenses and her medical bills

61
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,760
are all covered by my dad's money.

62
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,800
When did you ever support us?

63
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,120
Playing tough, huh?

64
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,280
Fine,

65
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,640
watch me

66
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,280
how I pull the plug on your mom.

67
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:24,320
You wouldn't dare!

68
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,320
Don't you leave!

69
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,040
Feeling regret now?

70
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:27,880
It's too late.

71
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:30,960
You're despicable.

72
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,000
I'll end you!

73
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,120
Are you crazy? Calm down!

74
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,560
It wasn't on purpose.

75
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,320
Let me go.

76
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,480
I'll turn myself in.

77
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,760
Even if you turn yourself in,

78
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,880
will she survive?

79
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,960
I'll end you!

80
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,960
The one who harmed her

81
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,800
wasn't me.

82
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,040
It was you.

83
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,360
It was all of you.

84
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,480
If you hadn't pushed her

85
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,960
to deceive me,

86
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,800
I wouldn't have reacted.

87
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,840
You tried to help her,

88
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,720
but failed to protect her.

89
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,560
You're the ones

90
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,680
who caused her death.

91
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,800
It was you all!

92
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,240
You're dead!

93
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:37,880
Mom.

94
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,080
Since last night,

95
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,720
you haven't spoken to us.

96
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,600
Silence won't solve this.

97
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,680
Let's talk it out.

98
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:48,830
Ms. Qin,

99
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,400
the new guard is here.

100
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,800
Mr. Zhou's room is ready.

101
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,160
Room?

102
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,440
What room?

103
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,160
I've made up my mind.

104
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,160
Since you insist on being together,

105
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,600
I won't take you abroad.

106
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,160
The three of us

107
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,880
will live here together.

108
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,400
Never to part.

109
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,600
You're going too far.

110
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,640
I've already agreed to your wishes.

111
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,760
What more do you want?

112
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,680
How much should I compromise?

113
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,560
I just want respect.

114
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,320
I know.

115
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,400
You've been guilty about my sister.

116
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,440
You feel remorse.

117
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,400
So you treat me better

118
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,120
and discipline me more.

119
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,840
But I'm not her.

120
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,600
But you're the only one I have.

121
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,040
Besides you,

122
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,080
there's no one. What should I do?

123
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,920
But you can't protect me forever.

124
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Someday,

125
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,440
I'll have to learn to live on my own.

126
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,440
Even if

127
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,320
I'm no longer in this world,

128
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,200
he will take care of you

129
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,240
and protect you.

130
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,080
I can't bear

131
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,040
the pain of losing daughters again.

132
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,160
I'm begging you,

133
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,200
please, please!

134
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,920
Can you please understand me?

135
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,280
Mom, I...

136
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,040
Have you thought about

137
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,640
how your real daughter would feel?

138
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,360
Would she want to be replaced?

139
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,040
Would she want another girl

140
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:24,920
to take her place

141
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,160
and to be cared for by her mom?

142
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,000
I doubt she would.

143
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,840
Why should your memories with her

144
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,000
turn into memories with others?

145
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,680
I feel guilty about my parents too,

146
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,640
but I've never thought of

147
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,320
replacing them with someone else.

148
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,040
They're truly one of a kind.

149
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,560
Guilt is just guilt.

150
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,600
It can't fix anything.

151
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,200
Zhiyi,

152
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,160
I was wrong.

153
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:08,280
I'm sorry, Zhiyi, I'm so sorry.

154
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,160
- Zhiyi.
- Mom!

155
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,880
Can you forgive me, please?

156
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:12,720
Zhiyi,

157
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,320
I made such a big mistake.

158
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:19,440
Is there still a chance to fix this?

159
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,720
Tell me, Zhiyi.

160
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:24,000
Is there hope for me to fix things?

161
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,360
Zhiyi, Zhiyi, say something, please!

162
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,360
It's alright.

163
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,380
Everything will be fine.

164
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,280
She raised me all these years.

165
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,840
Seeing her so sad

166
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,320
hurts me.

167
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,760
Everything will be okay.

168
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,240
What about you?

169
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,560
You and your parents?

170
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,920
I'm alright.

171
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:16,320
Just wondering

172
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,840
