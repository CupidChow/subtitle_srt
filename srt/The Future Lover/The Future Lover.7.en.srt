2
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,470
Go to the Ghost Building after lunch.

3
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:24,400
I'm not going.

4
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,360
You can go without me.

5
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,640
I dare you not to go.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:28,920
Let go of me!

7
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:30,040
Let go!

8
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:31,600
Why should I go?

9
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:33,160
Who knows your intentions.

10
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:34,440
Let go!

11
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:35,800
If you dare not go,

12
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,520
I'll pull the plug on your mom.

13
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:38,640
You wouldn't dare.

14
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:40,840
Are you going?

15
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:43,880
Fine, I'll go.

16
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,400
I'll go.

17
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,120
3 PM.

18
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,560
Don't be late.

19
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,960
(I wonder what tricks he's up to.)

20
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,480
(Anyway, I got my 500k already.)

21
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,600
Zhiyi, what do you want to know?

22
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,240
Just ask me.

23
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,120
Zhong Ziye,

24
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,520
what's your game now?

25
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,600
I should ask you

26
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,200
the same question.

27
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,040
Zhong Ziye,

28
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,440
why are you here?

29
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,400
I...

30
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,440
was watching the show.

31
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,040
Then,

32
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,560
why didn't you step up?

33
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,280
Aren't you my future boyfriend?

34
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,640
Because

35
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,200
I wasn't me then.

36
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,640
I hadn't returned yet.

37
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,760
What's your link with Song Xingyue?

38
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,080
She helped me as a kid.

39
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,280
I'm just

40
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,840
thanking her.

41
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:58,660
(Meet me alone at the Ghost Building
or it'll go public...)

42
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,600
Maybe we should

43
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,360
go to the Ghost Building,

44
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,200
then we'll find out everything.

45
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,760
Xingyue!

46
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,440
What are you doing here?

47
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,840
Xingyue.

48
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:11,500
(Zhixing Building)

49
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,560
Sir, your injury looks bad.

50
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:17,640
You need anesthesia.

51
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,560
No,

52
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,480
I'm allergic to Procaine.

53
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,960
It could be very painful.

54
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,320
You'll have to endure it.

55
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,560
It's okay.

56
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,360
It's okay.

57
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,320
(Zhiyi is right beside me.)

58
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:19,720
(Why did he)

59
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,680
(rush out to save me?)

60
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,920
Doctor, how is it?

61
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,880
Nothing serious.

62
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,040
Just a bit shaken.

63
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,280
Slight concussion.

64
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,640
That's good.

65
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,160
Did you face any trouble?

66
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,880
Why so many bruises?

67
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,080
It's okay.

68
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,080
I just fell accidentally.

69
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,800
Thank you

70
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,280
for saving me.

71
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,400
Was it Gao Qiang?

72
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,720
How did you know?

73
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,640
Song Xingyue,

74
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:07,120
all these years,

75
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,480
how tough was it for you?

76
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,000
You...

77
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,200
(Gao Qiang, I won't let you off.)

78
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,920
Zhong Ziye!

79
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,200
Miss, wait for your medicine.

80
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,280
(Did you save me because you knew me?)

81
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,320
(When did you recognize me?)

82
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,120
Sorry about that.

83
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,200
How are you feeling?

84
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,480
I'm okay.

85
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,480
Just a bit shaky at first,

86
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,720
but got better later.

87
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,160
Well,

88
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,680
thanks for saving my life.

89
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,320
No problem.

90
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,520
So what's going on here?

91
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,240
Why was Xingyue there?

92
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,760
Xingyue's stepfather is Gao Qiang.

93
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:16,960
And Gao Qiang

94
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,680
is the one blackmailing you.
