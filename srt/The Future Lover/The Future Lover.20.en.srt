00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,800
You're so annoying.

3
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,640
I don't want to see you again!

4
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:25,480
How can I...

5
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,200
I'm sorry.

Zhiyi.

19
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:51,840
Why are you here?

20
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,080
Came to ask you directly.

21
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,480
You and Zhou Nanfeng seem off.

22
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:56,250
And Zhong Ziye just took you away.

23
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:57,440
I rushed to follow you.

24
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,000
- I...
- Let's go, no questions.

25
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,600
Why are you here?

26
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:11,700
She's here to help me.

27
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:12,900
Don't make it hard for her.

28
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:14,700
I need to take her away.

29
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:39,900
Let's eat first.

30
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:41,700
I'll drop you at school after.

31
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:43,460
Otherwise, when you get back,

32
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,620
the cafeteria will be closed.

33
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:55,780
These dishes

34
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:57,340
are all your favorites.

35
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:02,220
Zhong Ziye,

36
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,140
don't be nice to me.

37
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,180
We really can't be together.

38
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:11,860
But you like him,

39
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:13,820
and he likes you too.

40
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,660
Why can't you be together?

41
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:18,720
- Xingyue.
- Because...

42
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:22,980
Because

43
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,460
I'm from the future.

44
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:47,860
It's you.

45
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:53,020
Why are you looking for me?

46
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:54,940
Leave Zhiyi.

47
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:57,020
Name your terms.

48
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:59,420
(Zhiyi's mom is quite demanding.)

49
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,460
(I need to deal with her first,)

50
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,910
(then think about me and Zhiyi.)

51
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,180
Otherwise,

52
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,900
you'll jeopardize your future.

53
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:13,740
Alright,

54
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:16,420
I'll leave her.

55
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:19,260
Tell me,

56
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,420
do you want money or something else?

57
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:23,900
I don't need anything.

58
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:25,980
I'll explain it to her.

59
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,100
What's your game here?

60
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,260
I'm not playing any games.

61
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,860
Aren't our families enemies?

62
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:37,740
Why should I trust you?

63
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:43,900
What do you want then?

64
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:47,860
I went to the hospital to find you,

65
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,500
and saw you burning something.

66
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:52,620
Then a flash of light appeared,

67
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:53,860
and I fainted.

68
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,420
When I woke up,

69
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,340
I was back in time.

70
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:10,220
So,

71
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:13,780
are you both from the future?

72
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:20,100
But

73
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,540
what does that have to do

74
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:22,500
with you being together?

75
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,660
Because they're from different timelines.

76
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,830
I just lost him in that timeline.

77
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:32,540
I can't accept him in this timeline so soon.

78
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:35,140
So Zhou Nanfeng rejected me

79
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:36,140
because of this.

80
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:37,300
Where is he now?

81
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:39,160
He found that everything started

82
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,540
with Gao Qiang blackmailing Zhiyi,

83
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:41,740
so he's looking for Gao Qiang.

84
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,380
See what Gao Qiang is up to.

85
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:45,580
Good.

86
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:47,060
I'll go find him too.

87
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,100
No way.

88
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:49,940
Since these are two timelines,

89
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:51,540
I'll handle my own issues.

90
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:52,420
I can't let you all

91
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:53,740
rush around because of me.

92
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:54,940
I'll face Gao Qiang myself.

93
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:56,140
Zhiyi,

94
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:57,780
he's not blackmailing you now.

95
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,220
Why confront him?

96
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:01,660
I owe you my life.

97
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,950
I can't watch you suffer again.

98
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:06,860
That's not your fault.

99
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:07,980
Don't blame yourself.

100
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:11,080
Besides,

101
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,100
this is between Gao Qiang and me.

102
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:15,260
Whatever happens,

103
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,580
I should face it myself.

104
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:17,980
- No way!
- No way!

105
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,340
(Mom)

106
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:24,500
(Mom)

107
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:29,590
Hello.

108
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,140
Zhou Nanfeng was taken by my mom.

109
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:42,020
I need to head back.

110
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:43,460
Don't act on your own yet.

111
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:44,380
Wait till I return.

112
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:56,620
Tell me more about

113
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:58,380
the future.

114
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:00,100
Alright.

115
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:01,660
(Zhiyi,)

116
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:02,620
(I'm sorry.)

117
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,540
(I don't mean what I'm going to say.)

118
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:06,860
(But what else should we do?)

119
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,020
Are you okay?

120
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:13,180
Are you hurt?

121
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:14,660
Did my mom do anything to you?

122
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:16,220
I'm fine.

123
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:20,340
You scared me.

124
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,020
When I heard my mom took you away,

125
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,380
I rushed back immediately.

126
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:24,860
It's good you're back.

127
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:26,060
We can clear things up.

128
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,820
I don't have feelings for you.

129
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:31,000
Don't send your mom after me again.

130
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:33,820
Stop lying to me.

131
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,420
I know why you turned me down.

132
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:42,060
Is it because of my mom?

133
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:43,140
Did she threaten you?

134
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:44,420
No one threatened me.

135
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:45,700
Don't you understand?

136
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:46,940
I don't have feelings for you.

137
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:47,860
Don't be like this.

138
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:49,620
I'm with Song Xingyue now.

139
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:50,700
Stop bothering me.

140
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,820
My parents died because of the Qin family.

141
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,500
How could I ever be with you?

142
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,500
Don't be naive.

143
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,340
Move aside.

144
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:02,300
Move aside.

145
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:03,300
I won't.

146
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:07,740
Move aside!

147
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:17,340
(At least you made it out unharmed.)

148
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:18,300
Zhiyi.

149
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:24,420
I've always said

150
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:27,420
others will only use and hurt you.

151
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:29,900
I'm the only one who truly loves you.

152
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:31,540
Mom.

153
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:33,980
Let's leave this place

154
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,300
to live abroad.

155
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:37,020
