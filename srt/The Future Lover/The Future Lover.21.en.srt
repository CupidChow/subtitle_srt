2
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,360
Zhiyi said Zhou Nanfeng is fine

3
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:28,680
and will return to school.

4
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,320
I'm hungry.

5
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:39,760
Let's eat first.

6
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,040
In that space-time,

7
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:46,200
if I had come to you earlier,

8
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:50,000
would the ending have been different?

9
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:56,380
(Osmanthus Tea)

10
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,960
Life doesn't have so many "what ifs".

11
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,720
(What do I do?)

12
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,480
(I need to find a way out of here.)

13
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,200
(Isn't this the inn)

14
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,600
(I stayed with Zhou Nanfeng?)

15
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,440
You've pretended
to be my future boyfriend,

16
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,320
yet you won't admit you like me.

17
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:45,760
Mom.

18
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,120
I need to use the bathroom,

19
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:50,800
now.

20
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,840
I can't wait anymore.

21
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,600
Mom.

22
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:55,760
Pull over.

23
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,280
Stay with Zhiyi.

24
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,120
Okay.

25
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,560
What's wrong, Miss Qin?

26
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,400
It hurts too much.

27
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,160
Please get me some medicine.

28
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,240
Well...

29
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,720
If it gets worse,

30
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,300
I'll tell Mom

31
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,640
- it's your fault.
- Go quickly.

32
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,320
Okay.

33
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:36,880
Miss Qin!

34
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,960
Miss Qin, stop running!

35
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,260
It's dangerous!

36
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:42,680
How will I explain to President Qin?

37
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,550
Miss Qin,

38
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,400
why are you running?

39
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,440
What's wrong with you?

40
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,080
(This time,)

41
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,080
(no matter the cost,)

42
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,840
(I need to live for myself.)

43
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,640
Sir.

44
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,080
Can I borrow your phone?

45
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,880
Please, sir.

46
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,080
Just for a moment.

47
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,560
Thank you.

48
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,680
Zhou Nanfeng,

49
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,640
it's me.

50
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:36,920
I'm hurt.

51
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,750
I'm at Houhai Inn.

52
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,920
What's the use of you?

53
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,040
Couldn't even watch her properly.

54
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,320
Ms. Qin,

55
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,200
Zhiyi's phone

56
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,320
has been off all along.

57
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,520
Zhou Nanfeng's phone just went off too.

58
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,720
Great job.

59
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,120
In front of me,

60
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,120
they pulled off quite a performance.

61
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,920
Keep monitoring their phones

62
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:08,920
and their bank cards.

63
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,320
We must find them.

64
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,160
- Yes.
- Yes.

65
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,200
Let me see.

66
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,320
Where are you hurt?

67
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,160
You lied to me.

68
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:27,800
Wait a moment.

69
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,360
I know everything now.

70
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,120
Xingyue told me all of it.

71
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,080
Stop pushing me away.

72
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:39,650
I'm not Zhou Nanfeng
from your space-time.

73
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,080
But I'm Qin Zhiyi in this space-time.

74
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,080
In this space-time,

75
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,360
do we have to miss each other again?

76
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,640
I know,

77
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,760
I'm in your heart.

78
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,840
Otherwise, why rush over

79
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,740
when you heard I was hurt?

80
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,000
You've thought it through.

81
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,760
Yes,

82
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,720
everything.

83
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:12,980
So,

84
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,400
will you join me?

85
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:27,390
Sorry,

86
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:28,840
I shouldn't have pushed you away.

87
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,840
I was overthinking.

88
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,520
I'll stay by your side

89
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,920
until the end.

90
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,000
Do you know

91
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,640
why I called you here?

92
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,160
Why?

93
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,000
Because

94
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,320
I want to hear

95
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,760
the words you left unspoken.

96
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,480
I like you.

97
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,000
Zhou Nanfeng,

98
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,760
why do you

99
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,000
always care about me

100
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,360
and think about me?

101
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,680
