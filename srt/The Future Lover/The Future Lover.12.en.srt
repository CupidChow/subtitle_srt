2
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:23,240
Xingyue,

3
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:26,880
no one will bully you anymore.

4
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:28,980
What do you mean?

5
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:30,680
Gao Qiang is gone.

6
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:33,760
Gao Qiang?

7
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:35,040
Gone?

8
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:38,840
How did he die?

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:43,920
I killed him.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,720
You... you killed him?

11
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,880
Why did you kill him?

12
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,240
He kept bullying you.

13
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,240
How could you kill him?

14
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,800
How could you do that?

15
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,280
It's okay.

16
00:00:58,720 --> 00:00:59,640
Don't worry.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,240
Even if I travel back in time,

18
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,720
I'd do it again.

19
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,440
What now?

20
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,000
What should we do next?

21
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,360
I really miss you.

22
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,200
I want to talk with you.

23
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:13,760
That's why

24
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,560
I rushed here to see you.

25
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,600
Don't be upset.

26
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,480
Don't cry.

27
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,840
Ziye,

28
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,840
listen to me,

29
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,840
let's turn ourselves in.

30
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,040
Let's surrender.

31
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,200
There's still time.

32
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,600
It's too late.

33
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,360
Why is it too late?

34
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,880
We can still do it.

35
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,640
Let's go now.

36
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,920
About the murder,

37
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,980
I've thought a lot.

38
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:52,960
I wasn't wrong,

39
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,040
and I won't regret it.

40
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,680
Zhong Ziye!

41
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,200
Stay back!

42
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:03,240
Calm down.

43
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,200
Don't hurt her, please.

44
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,120
Stay away!

45
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,840
- Zhong Ziye!
- Okay, okay.

46
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,120
Don't do anything rash.

47
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,600
Zhong Ziye,

48
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,360
I know you won't hurt me.

49
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:14,680
What do you really want?

50
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,240
In the days ahead,

51
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,640
don't feel guilty.

52
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:24,840
Stay positive,

53
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,200
find happiness,

54
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,000
and live well.

55
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,080
Zhong Ziye,

56
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,320
don't do anything foolish.

57
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,400
Zhong Ziye,

58
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,120
don't act recklessly.

59
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,000
Forget about me.

60
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,600
Zhong Ziye! Zhong Ziye!

61
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,480
Zhong Ziye!

62
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,920
Zhong Ziye!

63
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:17,680
Ambulance.

64
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,720
Call the ambulance now!

65
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,080
Xingyue.

66
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:27,060
(Emergency)

67
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,400
That's all that happened.

68
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,640
Are you...

69
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,040
alright?

70
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,640
So,

71
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,560
everything he did

72
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,240
was for me.

73
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,160
Foolish one.

74
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,640
Why so silly?

75
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,800
(Room 7)
Can't the reach deceased's dad.

76
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,840
Can anyone contact other relatives?

77
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,400
The body needs to be claimed.

78
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,520
I'll do it.

79
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,120
He has no other family.

80
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,440
I'm his friend.

81
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,360
I'll be with you.

82
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,520
I'm fine.

83
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,800
I worry about you.

84
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,160
Don't worry.

85
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,520
I still have Mom to care for.

86
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:26,760
I'm okay.

87
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,000
Besides,

88
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,160
he probably doesn't want to see you.

89
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,240
Zhong Ziye,

90
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,600
I like you.

91
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,040
I've liked you for a long time.

92
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,800
Just changing the ending would've done.

93
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,840
Why did Zhong Ziye

94
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,720
choose revenge?

95
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,640
Is it worth it?

96
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,960
After Song Xingyue died,

97
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,920
revenging for her was his only goal.

98
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,640
This obsession grows deeper

99
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,440
and deeper.

100
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,360
It won't fade away.

101
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,560
How do you know so much?

102
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,160
I have my own obsessions too.

103
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,440
Just different from his.

104
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,720
Then why did you

105
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,440
come back from the future?

106
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,080
Because...

107
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,200
Run!

108
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,240
Chase them!

109
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,600
Stop!

110
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,000
Did you find them?

111
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,920
No.

112
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,360
- Let's go.
- Okay.

113
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,360
Let's go.

114
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:11,700
(Room 9)

115
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,800
Why is Mom in the hospital?

116
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,920
She probably followed me.

117
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,800
I missed your call

118
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,320
because she caught me.

119
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,880
What did she want?

120
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,320
She looked into my past

121
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,960
and tried to keep me away from you.

122
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,520
Is it because

123
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,040
of what happened before?

124
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:39,960
Yeah,

125
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,320
I think so.

126
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,160
Oh, no.

127
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,120
She'll investigate everything.

128
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,480
Soon she'll know it all.

129
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:56,380
(Mom: What's going on?)

130
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:58,520
(Oh no, Mom found the photo.)

131
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,960
(This is big trouble now.)

132
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,360
(What do I do?)

133
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:07,880
Zhou Nanfeng,

134
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,400
