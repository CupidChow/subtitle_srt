1
00:00:01,918 --> 00:00:03,461
We're romantic rivals.

2
00:00:04,045 --> 00:00:05,213
We'll have to settle this.

3
00:00:05,797 --> 00:00:06,840
Do it.

4
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:09,384
If you want Yuri, then kill me.

5
00:00:09,884 --> 00:00:11,970
This is a serious battle between you...

6
00:00:12,637 --> 00:00:14,639
and me, Toshiomi Oya.

7
00:00:15,223 --> 00:00:16,474
Man to man.

8
00:00:17,183 --> 00:00:19,352
You're all crazy.

9
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:20,812
Every one of you.

10
00:00:21,604 --> 00:00:24,399
I never know when I will see you again.

11
00:00:24,983 --> 00:00:27,277
I never know what might happen to you.

12
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,070
So when I'm with you,

13
00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:32,449
I want to be fully recharged by you.

14
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:36,161
I've crossed the borderline,

15
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,163
and now...

16
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:40,623
I'm right next to him.

17
00:00:45,253 --> 00:00:46,504
This time I spend with him...

18
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:49,382
is ours and only ours.

19
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:18,119
Yes. Hello?

20
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:21,915
Yuri... I want to see you.

21
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:26,586
I do too. A lot.

22
00:01:26,669 --> 00:01:28,630
I really want to see you.

23
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:41,559
Mr. Oya!

24
00:01:42,852 --> 00:01:43,937
Mr. Oya.

25
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:53,363
Yuri. Let me have
a good look at your face.

26
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:54,447
Yes.

27
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:01,371
What's the matter, Mr. Oya?

28
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:03,790
Well...

29
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:06,417
I love you so much, I'm going crazy.

30
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:14,425
I hired a boat for you, Yuri.
Do you like cruising?

31
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:17,303
I don't know. I've never...

32
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:23,560
Who are these people?

33
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,062
Don't make a scene.
There are people around.

34
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,105
Yes, sir.

35
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:29,941
It's been a long time, Mr. Oya.

36
00:02:30,608 --> 00:02:32,026
Our boss is calling for you.

37
00:02:33,027 --> 00:02:34,487
Please come along with us.

38
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:36,114
Boss?

39
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:39,492
I appreciate the invitation,
but I will have to decline.

40
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,579
I'm spending precious time with my lover.

41
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,250
Are you disobeying the boss' order?

42
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:48,710
Out of the way.

43
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:51,254
Yuri!

44
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:53,047
Let me see it.

45
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:56,009
I only scraped it. I'm all right.

46
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:58,178
Who do you think we are?

47
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:00,763
Don't mess with the mafia.

48
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:05,560
The mafia?

49
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:08,188
You don't want a date in hell, do you?

50
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:11,482
Just be a good boy and come with--

51
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:13,610
[gasps]

52
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:16,487
Do you know whose lover you just hurt?

53
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:20,950
It hurts!

54
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:23,536
You have some nerve.

55
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:29,918
Mr. Oya,
I think we got a little too excited.

56
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:39,552
Don't you ever go near her again.

57
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:47,810
The boss will deal with you for sure.

58
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:53,066
Let's get your hand treated.

59
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:00,823
I hope it doesn't leave a scar.

60
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:03,534
I'm okay. It doesn't hurt at all.

61
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:13,336
I'm so sorry I always put you
in dangerous situations.

62
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:16,798
Don't be... Mr. Oya.

63
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:20,051
So, Yuri.

64
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:24,597
I'm gonna make sure it won't happen again.

65
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:30,144
Wait for me at my house.

66
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:31,688
Huh?

67
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:34,565
Make sure you drive safely.

68
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:38,152
I want us... to go home together.

69
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:43,283
I'll be home as soon as possible, Yuri.

70
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:01,634
It's okay. I'll be back by morning.

71
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:07,765
I promise.

72
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:16,899

Take Yuri home safely.

81
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:12,330
-Yes.
-Yes.

82
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:15,416
-We'll come too.
-It's Boss' order, Ginji.

83
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:18,002
You're the only ones I can rely on.

84
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:19,879
We're going.

85
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:35,186
Let's go. Start the car.

86
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:37,188
Um, what is happening?

87
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:39,649
Damn, it's started.

88
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:40,733
Hurry. Let's go now.

89
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:43,903
No... It can't be... Why? Wait!

90
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:45,113
Please stop that!

91
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:47,323
No! Let me out!

92
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:48,658
Mr. Oya!

93
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:53,621
Please calm down!

94
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:57,333
Let me go!

95
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:59,085
Where's Mr. Oya?

96
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:01,379
Don't be rough with her.

97
00:07:01,462 --> 00:07:04,132
-But...
-I guess there's no other way.

98
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:05,967
We have to lock her up for now.

99
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:08,803
Let me go back. This is ridiculous!

100
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,388
Hey, you guys!

101
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:14,767
I understand that Mr. Oya
lives with the risk of death.

102
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,063
But how can I ignore this?

103
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,649
He was just by my side...

104
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:24,652
What's the matter, Mr. Oya?

105
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:26,237
Well...

106
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:28,865
I love you so much, I'm going crazy.

107
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:35,288
Please! Let me go back!

108
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,044
We're sorry we had to use force.

109
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,922
It's necessary for you to wait here
until the matter is settled.

110
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:50,303
No! Open the door!

111
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:52,388
Open it!

112
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:53,723
Open the door!

113
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:55,141
Please be patient.

114
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:57,977
Even if you went back there,

115
00:07:58,227 --> 00:07:59,604
what on Earth could you do?

116
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:04,192
We truly apologize.

117
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:06,736
Boss is trying his best...

118
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:09,864
to fulfill his duties as a leader.

119
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:14,410
We can't let you get in the way.

120
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:19,916
More than anything,
we were entrusted with this mission.

121
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,628
To keep you from harm.

122
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,547
Not a single scratch.

123
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:32,220
Don't let his concern
for your safety go to waste.

124
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:34,639
Please refrain from being reckless.

125
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,935
It's okay. I'll be back by morning.

126
00:08:43,564 --> 00:08:44,482
I promise.

127
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:01,207
He knew what might happen.

128
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:07,338
He lied to me

129
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:10,299
in order to save me.

130
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:23,187
The strength of his embrace,
the heat of his body...

131
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:27,358
All the times
he whispered my name to me...

132
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:29,110
His words of love...

133
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,531
It all remains so clearly in my memory.

134
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:36,450
Don't go.

135
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:41,163
Come back... Mr. Oya.

136
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:30,838
Mr. Oya was desperately trying
to protect me.

137
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:38,471
The morning he promised to return...

138
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:42,433
Mr. Oya didn't come back.

139
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:51,067
Um... Shouldn't we let her out now?

140
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:54,570
We locked her in there the whole night.

141
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:56,322
Yes.

142
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:58,741
I'm worried about her mental state.

143
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:01,243
She's just a university student

144
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:03,788
who had nothing to do
with the world of the yakuza.

145
00:11:11,962 --> 00:11:14,090
Um, can you let me out now?

146
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,509
Wait just a moment.

147
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:19,095
But don't drop your guard.

148
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:21,764
She might become violent
to try to see the boss.

149
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,903
I'm hungry. Is there anything to eat?

150
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:39,949
Uh... Yes.

151
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:41,992
Thank you.

152
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:46,539
I'm sorry I acted violently last night.

153
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,958
Did I hurt either of you?

154
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:52,378
No, we're both okay.

155
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,215
I'm gonna take a bath now.

156
00:11:57,466 --> 00:11:59,343
I'll eat in the room.

157
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:01,512
Please prepare something for me.

158
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:04,807
Y-Yes.

159
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:16,360
And... did you hear anything from Mr. Oya?

160
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:20,698
No, nothing yet.

161
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:23,159
We have our men going over to check now.

162
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:35,129
If there is news that he has died,
I'll go home immediately.

163
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:39,550
I don't know what usually happens,
but I assume there would be confusion.

164
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:42,762
I wouldn't be able to do anything anyway.

165
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:44,638
I'd just be in the way.

166
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:49,477
But I wish to attend the funeral.

167
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:53,689
Excuse me while I take a bath.

168
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:01,989
Looks like she got over it.

169
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:05,075
She seems so calm now.

170
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,296
My face looks so awful.

171
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:22,468
Yuri. Let me have
a good look at your face.

172
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:23,552
Yes.

173
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:35,815
I need to quickly do something
about my puffy eyes.

174
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:49,620
Thank you very much.

175
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,790
-Excuse me.
-Excuse me.

176
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:02,716
I'm eating.

177
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:14,103
I have to fix my swollen face.

178
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:18,691
I have to eat, and sleep properly.

179
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:21,235
I need to gain strength.

180
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:26,407
Because he said

181
00:14:27,157 --> 00:14:28,325
he'll be back.

182
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:45,926
Excuse us.

183
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:49,972
The boss is back.

184
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:01,066
Yuri.

185
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:31,722
Welcome back, Mr. Oya.

186
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:41,857
Mr. Oya.

187
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,031
Boss!

188
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:58,499
I...

189
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,877
knew it would be hard.

190
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:05,297
But it was my decision.

191
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:09,677
I decided to be your lover.

192
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:12,471
So I thought...

193
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:16,308
no matter how hard it gets,
I should bear it.

194
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,770
But I can't take it anymore.

195
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:28,237
I know I'm not making sense, but whatever.

196
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:32,157
I want you to know
how I felt waiting for you.

197
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:34,535
I want you to listen to it all.

198
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:37,162
I want you to take it all in.

199
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,668
I'll accept it all.

200
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:46,380
But...

201
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:50,884
I can't be yelled at
in front of my subordinates.

202
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:53,095
It may diminish my authority.

203
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:55,180
Let me down! I want to do it here!

204
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:58,517
I want to yell at you in front of them!

205
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:00,853
Hey!

206
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:02,855
Let me down! I'm so angry!

207
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:04,940
You're such an idiot! Idiot underboss!

208
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,154
What?

209
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:12,990
Did I hurt your pride
by calling you stupid?

210
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:15,534
I don't care.

211
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:18,454
I'm not afraid of you at all, Mr. Oya.

212
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:26,086
You don't know...

213
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:29,423
how I felt...

214
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:34,178
waiting for you all night.

215
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:39,433
You don't know...

216
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:11,423
I know.

217
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:14,593
Mr. Oya can nod but can't say anything.

218
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:17,846
He lives in a world so close to death.

219
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:21,058
The same thing could happen in the future.

220
00:18:21,725 --> 00:18:25,020
So he won't tell me lies
to make me feel better.

221
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:27,648
He's kind...

222
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:29,900
but he's cruel.

223
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:38,075
I really hate this cruel man,

224
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:40,202
and at the same time...

225
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:44,414
I'm hopelessly in love with him.

226
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,045
Mr. Oya.

227
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:53,298
Make love to me.

228
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:01,098
It was...

229
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,893
unbearably hard for me.

230
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,604
I was scared.

231
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:13,443
It's a feeling I'm having trouble with.

232
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:16,780
Do I have to deal with it by myself?

233
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:21,618
You didn't die.

234
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:24,538
Hurry up and make it go away.

235
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:49,855
Yuri.

236
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:53,859
Mr. Oya is right here with me.

237
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:57,654
Mr. Oya's voice,

238
00:19:58,322 --> 00:20:02,659
his breath, the warmth of his body,
and his scent...

239
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:04,411
They're all right here.

240
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:11,752
It's not enough.

241
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:15,422
I need more of Mr. Oya.

242
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:19,176
I need him to fill me up, fast.

243
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:24,640
I need to be filled up by Mr. Oya
until there is no gap anywhere.

244
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:44,451
We made love to each other over and over.

245
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:45,619
Then night fell.

246
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:48,830
My senses started to become numb

247
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:51,416
and my mind became hazy.

248
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:55,420
I almost lost consciousness.

249
00:20:57,714 --> 00:21:00,050
Please, Mr. Oya.

250
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:04,137
Stay here with me

251
00:21:04,888 --> 00:21:06,473
even if I pass out.

252
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:15,565
I can't get enough of you, Yuri.

253
00:21:21,321 --> 00:21:22,406
So?

254
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:25,826
You just came crawling back completely
defeated by them?

255
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:31,081
Why didn't you bring him here,
you useless idiot?

256
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:37,337
Still though,

257
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:40,674
I can't believe Toshiomi left you
with only those wounds.

258
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:43,635
He seems to have gone soft.

259
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:51,351
I see. It must be this girl's fault.

260
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:56,398
Why is he into such a skinny lady?
Not much to enjoy.

261
00:21:57,399 --> 00:22:01,236
Boss, I think it would be better
if we stayed away from Mr. Oya.

262
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:04,948
There's no telling what he'll do next.

263
00:22:11,538 --> 00:22:14,708
I'm not the one who was told
to stay away from her.

264
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:23,425
I guess a bony woman would do.

265
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,682
The important thing is that
she's Toshiomi's woman.

266
00:22:33,268 --> 00:22:34,311
Well then,

267
00:22:35,562 --> 00:22:38,231
I guess I should
introduce myself to his lady.

268
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:32,035
PREVIEW

269
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:33,829
This is a place
where you and I can be alone.

270
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:35,580
Let's enjoy ourselves all night.

271
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:38,291
You're the one who ignited my desire.

272
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:39,418
Toshiomi.

273
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:45,173
You're gonna be my lover
from today onwards.

274
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:48,218
First, place a kiss where you belong.

275
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:50,762
It's all my fault.

276
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:52,889
I'll make him
pay the price for his desire.

277
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:55,142
I won't let anyone touch me

278
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:56,393
except for Mr. Oya.

279
00:23:56,476 --> 00:24:00,063
Forgive me Yuri,
I still don't want to let you go.

280
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:00,981
