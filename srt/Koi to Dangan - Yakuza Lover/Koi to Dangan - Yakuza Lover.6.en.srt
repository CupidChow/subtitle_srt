1
00:00:01,918 --> 00:00:04,295
<i>Do you know how much effort I put</i>

2
00:00:04,379 --> 00:00:06,464
<i>into making you mine?</i>

3
00:00:07,048 --> 00:00:09,134
<i>It's been a long time
since my drink has been spiked.</i>

4
00:00:10,218 --> 00:00:11,928
<i>This time, it really is goodbye.</i>

5
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:14,597
<i>It might get a little violent.</i>

6
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:16,224
<i>I don't mind him being rough,</i>

7
00:00:16,766 --> 00:00:18,685
<i>because it's Mr. Oya.</i>

8
00:00:19,227 --> 00:00:20,478
Yuri!

9
00:00:20,562 --> 00:00:22,939
I'm not letting you out
until you break up with him.

10
00:00:23,231 --> 00:00:24,399
What are you saying?

11
00:00:24,482 --> 00:00:26,151
Why don't you be my girlfriend?

12
00:00:28,403 --> 00:00:29,571
<i>I'll cherish you.</i>

13
00:00:29,654 --> 00:00:31,322
<i>I know I can.</i>

14
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:33,825
<i>You're absolutely right, Jin.</i>

15
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:35,452
<i>But it's not possible.</i>

16
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:38,121
<i>I'd rather spend
just a minute more with him</i>

17
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:41,374
<i>than being hit on by you.</i>

18
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:47,047
What's that?

19
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:12,530
Whose lover do you think you kidnapped?

20
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:17,494
You dumb kid.

21
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:20,121
-You...
-Mr. Oya!

22
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:31,382
I'm asking you, who do you think I am?

23
00:01:32,383 --> 00:01:34,886
Stop, Mr. Oya.
He hasn't done anything to me.

24
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:39,349
You're gonna kill him.

25
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:40,642
Please, Mr. Oya!

26
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:49,651
Don't ever think
you could keep me away from Yuri.

27
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:52,112
This is a warning.

28
00:01:53,571 --> 00:01:54,405
Got it?

29
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:01,454
Yuri.

30
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:07,460
Hey... Listen to me.

31
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:09,754
Give up on her!

32
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:11,798
Stay away from Yuri!

33
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:13,216
I'm begging you!

34
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:18,096
Mr. Oya, I'm sorry I worried you.

35
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:20,598
But... Jin really didn't harm me at all.

36
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:24,060
We're childhood friends,
and he was worried about me.

37
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:28,356
Yuri.

38
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:34,696
I don't want...

39
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:37,198
anybody's eyes on you.

40
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,579
I'll have to confine you for a while.

41
00:02:44,747 --> 00:02:45,665
What?

42
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:51,421
EPISODE SIX:
CHILDHOOD FRIEND AND RIVAL

43
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,802

YAKUZA LOVER

50
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:49,729
He touched you, didn't he?

51
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:53,775
I can smell that man on you.

52
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:56,736
Stay still while I override it.

53
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:04,744
I'm sorry.

54
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,788
I'm sorry.

55
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:09,040
I'm sorry.

56
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:24,973
Yuri.

57
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:28,226
I apologize.

58
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:46,077
I lost control.

59
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:48,913
I'm really sorry.

60
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:18,943
<i>Since then,</i>

61
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:21,904
<i>Mr. Oya hasn't talked about Jin at all.</i>

62
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:25,950
<i>Since he won't mention it,</i>

63
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:29,454
<i>there's no reason for me to bring it up.</i>

64
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,625
Don't ever think
you could keep me away from Yuri.

65
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:36,878
This is a warning.

66
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:39,213
Got it?

67
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:43,593
-Here.
-Hm?

68
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:45,720
Thanks.

69
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,557
You know, sometimes I think

70
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:52,268
that you have a boyfriend
you're not telling me about.

71
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:56,105
The way you're acting these days!

72
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:57,315
What's the deal with that?

73
00:05:57,899 --> 00:05:59,567
I'd tell you if I had a boyfriend!

74
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:04,322
Well, you're not required
to report to me or anything.

75
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:07,700
But if you want,

76
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:11,496
you could tell me your type
and I'll set you up again.

77
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:12,914
Thanks.

78
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:19,379
Oops. My next class is about to start.

79
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:20,713
I have to go now.

80
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:22,590
-See you.
-See you later.

81
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:26,719
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

82
00:06:31,432 --> 00:06:34,560
<i>I hope Mr. Oya won't do anything to Jin.</i>

83
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:38,022
<i>I have a bad feeling.</i>

84
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,115
Yes.

85
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:50,868
I have a good tip for the police.

86
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:52,787
Please come to our office.

87
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:55,289
Oh, and one other thing...

88
00:06:57,333 --> 00:07:01,212
You seem to have
a very vibrant young detective.

89
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:05,133
I'd love to meet him too.

90
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:11,681
Oof, I'm exhausted.

91
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:21,524
I'd rather spend
just a minute more with him

92
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,111
than being hit on by you.

93
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,209
She's Toshiomi Oya's girl...

94
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,253
That's the reality.

95
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:48,759
What the heck should I do?

96
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:01,606
Hello? What is it?

97
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:03,900
Some kind of trouble?

98
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:06,611
<i>The underboss of the Oya syndicate</i>

99
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,821
<i>is asking for you.</i>

100
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:23,711
I've been ordered to
only let the young man in.

101
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:30,301
Now go get that great tip.

102
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:33,304
You'll be okay.

103
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:35,264
Yup.

104
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,100
What the hell is he thinking?

105
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:41,479
Please come in.

106
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:43,940
I'm going in.

107
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:58,162
Welcome to our office.

108
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:00,957
Sorry I lost control the other day.

109
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,084
Oh,

110
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,127
I do have a good tip for you.
I wasn't lying.

111
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:07,797
But first...

112
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:11,175
We're romantic rivals.

113
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:13,469
We'll have to settle this.

114
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:21,811
You like Yuri, right?

115
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:24,480
Jin, her childhood friend.

116
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:28,859
You... know everything...

117
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,487
There's something important to do
before we settle this.

118
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,322
-Show him.
-Yes, sir.

119
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:47,378
What is this?

120
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:51,215
A token of my apology.

121
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:52,925
I'm a yakuza.

122
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:57,805
We are prohibited from meddling
with people who are not yakuza.

123
00:09:57,888 --> 00:09:59,473
I broke that code.

124
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:02,351
I forgot my place

125
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:05,521
and acted recklessly like an ordinary man.

126
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:06,606
Forgive me.

127
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:13,237
But I want you to understand.

128
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,782
My lover who was only just by my side

129
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:18,242
was kidnapped while I was unaware.

130
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:20,494
I had no way of knowing
what was happening to her.

131
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:23,164
What angered me the most was her arm.

132
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:27,251
She tried to hide it,
but it was bruised pretty badly.

133
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:31,172
-Come with me!
-Wai...

134
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:32,423
Jin!

135
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:47,938
Since you and I are both to blame,

136
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:50,024
I want you to accept this money.

137
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:56,072
I don't want your damn money.

138
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:58,199
I found out she was dating a yakuza.

139
00:10:58,282 --> 00:11:01,619
Of course, I would try to
get her to break up with you!

140
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:08,042
You know you're supposed
to stay in your world.

141
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:10,544
Keep your hands off Yuri from now on.

142
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:14,423
It's too late.

143
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:17,259
Yuri is an exception to the rule for me.

144
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:24,850
So, let's settle this.

145
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:26,310
Huh?

146
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:37,279
What... are you doing?

147
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,616
If you want Yuri,

148
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:43,828
then you'll have to kill me first.

149
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:46,163
What?

150
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:48,958
Even if you kill me,
the syndicate won't interfere.

151
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,126
We won't retaliate.

152
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:53,587
She wouldn't be told the truth,
and you wouldn't have to tell her either.

153
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:56,173
She would be grieving
but she would be yours.

154
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,217
-Huh?
-However...

155
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:03,013
The thing you'd have to bear...

156
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:05,641
would be my death.

157
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:09,520
This is a serious battle between you...

158
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,982
and me, Toshiomi Oya.

159
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:16,068
Man to man.

160
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:36,213
You can't be serious.

161
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:38,716
There's no way I could do that.

162
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:57,818
I can't even breathe without Yuri anymore.

163
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:01,489
<i>I can't feel at peace without her.</i>

164
00:13:02,072 --> 00:13:02,907
Mr. Oya.

165
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:04,575
Mr. Oya.

166
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:05,993
You make me so happy.

167
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:07,161
Thank you, Mr. Oya.

168
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:10,956
<i>Yuri is the only one who makes me happy.</i>

169
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:16,253
For me to be happy, I need Yuri.

170
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:20,758
But...

171
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:24,428
if I die, it's nothingness.

172
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:28,766
If I die, my desire for her would be gone.

173
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:33,229
I am a greedy man.

174
00:13:34,688 --> 00:13:37,942
That's the only way
you can get me to leave her.

175
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:45,324
Shoot me.

176
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:48,035
Do it.

177
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:50,329
Stop it.

178
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,332
If you want Yuri, then kill me.

179
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:54,708
Stop it.

180
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:57,211
Let me go.

181
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:02,216
There's no way I could kill you!

182
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:15,271
No way... Hey...

183
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:21,402
Hey.

184
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:31,912
It's still loaded.

185
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:36,208
Try again.

186
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:49,972
If you'll excuse me, then.

187
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:55,728
Someday...

188
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:59,481
I swear I'll get you someday.

189
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:04,486
And while you're away,

190
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:06,864
I'll make Yuri choose me.

191
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:10,826
That would be futile.

192
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:14,455
No one can come between us.

193
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:21,086
That's how much we are in love.

194
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:24,173
Goodbye.

195
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:26,550
I'll see you around.

196
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,902
You're all crazy.

197
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:47,154
Every one of you.

198
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:51,241
So am I.

199
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:01,126
Yuri. Come over here.

200
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:13,973
Hm?

201
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:17,059
Nothing.

202
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:23,941
<i>It seems I didn't have to
worry about anything.</i>

203
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:27,236
Boss, excuse me.

204
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:42,001
Um, Mr. Oya, what's all this?

205
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:45,504
Of course...

206
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:48,632
It's for you.

207
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:51,385
Why all of a sudden?

208
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:56,807
<i>Could it be because he roughed Jin up?</i>

209
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,144
<i>Is he still worried about that?</i>

210
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:17,870
Mr. Oya, thank you very much.

211
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:25,210
Hey Yuri,

212
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:27,963
is there anything you want me to do?

213
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:31,467
I want you to feel more happiness
while being with me.

214
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:34,970
That thought...

215
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,765
just occurred to me.

216
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:42,895
There is something

217
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:44,897
I want you to do.

218
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:46,690
What?

219
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:51,070
What is it, Yuri?

220
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:55,783
I want you to kiss me a lot,

221
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:57,326
hug me a lot,

222
00:17:58,202 --> 00:18:00,871
and look me in the eyes a lot.

223
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:05,209
I never know when I will see you again.

224
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:08,587
I never know what might happen to you.

225
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:10,547
I want to be strong,

226
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:12,883
even when I'm uncertain.

227
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:16,136
So when I'm with you,

228
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:18,305
I want to be fully recharged by you.

229
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:23,310
That's all you want?

230
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:26,146
That's what I really want!

231
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:45,290
I'm happy now.

232
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,335
I need you, Mr. Oya,

233
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:50,462
to feel happiness.

234
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:55,259
I want to stay by your side.

235
00:18:58,762 --> 00:18:59,763
Yuri.

236
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:25,998
Wow!

237
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:29,126
It's a red dress!

238
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:33,005
It's red and flashy but also elegant.
It's beautiful.

239
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:37,342
Hey, Yuri.

240
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:40,095
Can I ask you a favor?

241
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:42,306
Yes?

242
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:47,144
I want you to try on

243
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:49,021
the clothes I gave you.

244
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:54,401
Who knows if I'll ever get to see you
wearing them all.

245
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:01,241
I want to have a variety of images of you
in my memory.

246
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:07,664
Mr. Oya.

247
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:10,083
That's not a favor.

248
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:12,878
Because...

249
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:14,880
to be seen by you is my desire.

250
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,055
Look, Mr. Oya.

251
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:30,103
You're beautiful.

252
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:33,357
My first wide-brim hat!

253
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:35,817
<i>Look at me, Mr. Oya.</i>

254
00:20:38,528 --> 00:20:39,529
It's pretty.

255
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:50,040
You look beautiful, Yuri.

256
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:55,963
<i>Look at me more, Mr. Oya.</i>

257
00:20:58,131 --> 00:21:00,717
<i>I look beautiful because you love me.</i>

258
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:03,929
<i>Please imprint this image in your heart.</i>

259
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:16,817
You're so beautiful, Yuri.

260
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:29,871
Whoa.

261
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:32,499
You're assaulting me.

262
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:43,093
Are you assaulting me now?

263
00:21:43,176 --> 00:21:45,429
Yes, I am.

264
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,232
<i>I've crossed the borderline,</i>

265
00:21:58,191 --> 00:21:59,401
<i>and now...</i>

266
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:01,778
<i>I'm right next to him.</i>

267
00:22:05,365 --> 00:22:06,742
<i>Nobody knows about it.</i>

268
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:09,411
<i>I won't tell my friends.</i>

269
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:11,496
<i>Or my family.</i>

270
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:13,457
<i>Or my childhood friends.</i>

271
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:19,921
<i>This time I spend with him...</i>

272
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,217
<i>is ours and only ours.</i>

273
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,275
Now then...

274
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:23,610
PREVIEW

275
00:23:23,693 --> 00:23:26,154
Time to say hello to the ladies.

276
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:28,573
<i>What's the matter, Mr. Oya?</i>

277
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:30,867
I love you so much, I'm going crazy.

278
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:34,079
<i>Who do you think we are?</i>

279
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:35,872
<i>Don't mess with the mafia.</i>

280
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:39,084
Do you know whose lover you just hurt?

281
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:40,919
<i>Wait for me at my house.</i>

282
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:43,839
It's okay. I'll be back by morning.

283
00:23:45,006 --> 00:23:46,842
<i>I have a bad feeling.</i>

284
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:50,637
No! Open the door!

285
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,305
Open the door!

286
00:23:54,808 --> 00:23:55,809
<i>Don't go.</i>

287
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:59,020
<i>Come back, Mr. Oya.</i>

288
00:23:59,104 --> 00:23:59,938
THIS DRAMA IS FICTIONAL.

289
