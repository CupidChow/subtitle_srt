1
00:00:02,252 --> 00:00:04,004
I'm the underboss of the Oya syndicate.

2
00:00:04,087 --> 00:00:05,922
The name's Toshiomi Oya.

3
00:00:06,506 --> 00:00:07,674
Are you hurt?

4
00:00:08,299 --> 00:00:09,634
Yakuza?

5
00:00:10,218 --> 00:00:12,470
We meet again, young lady.

6
00:00:12,971 --> 00:00:14,180
A present.

7
00:00:14,264 --> 00:00:16,891
I didn't bring the coat back for a reward.

8
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:18,226
It's not a reward...

9
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:19,686
I'm wooing you.

10
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:23,982
Someone wants him dead.

11
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:26,067
He could be killed at any time.

12
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:28,903
He has to be prepared for that every day.

13
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:31,906
I can't get involved with him!

14
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:33,408
Yuri...

15
00:00:33,825 --> 00:00:36,286
This might be the last time we have sex.

16
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:38,413
Let's feel wrong together.

17
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:40,540
Okay...

18
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:42,125
Being with you...

19
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:44,127
is so hard, Mr. Oya.

20
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:45,962
But...

21
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:48,465
I...

22
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:51,593
want to be your lover.

23
00:00:51,676 --> 00:00:55,305
You should know
that I'm naturally very dominant.

24
00:01:01,644 --> 00:01:03,146
I won't let go once I have something.

25
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:30,840
Mr. Oya, we're in the entrance hall.

26
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,635
W-Wait. Please.

27
00:01:33,718 --> 00:01:34,636
I can't wait.

28
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:37,347
I can't do this here.

29
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,682
But I'm not trying to play hard to get.

30
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:00,537
Mr. Oya.

31
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:09,003
That day...

32
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:10,296
Huh?

33
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:13,925
I put you in a dangerous situation.

34
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:16,427
But you still came to see me again.

35
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:20,598
You showed me you had courage.

36
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:23,810
I wanted you desperately because of that.

37
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,358
I was fighting my impulse like hell

38
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:32,944
so you'd have a way out.

39
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:34,529
But...

40
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:36,865
you...

41
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:42,620
I can't hide this crazy love any longer.

42
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:46,791
Let me hold you now.

43
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:51,629
EPISODE TWO:
MADNESS AND JOY

44
00:02:54,048 --> 00:02:58,011
YAKUZA LOVER

50
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:36,674
YAKUZA LOVER

51
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:57,445
Your voice is sweet.

52
00:03:58,696 --> 00:03:59,781
Because you're...

53
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:02,784
You're...

54
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:04,911
being so intense...

55
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:08,081
Yuri.

56
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,208
I love you.

57
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,301
I love you.

58
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:22,428
I love you.

59
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:25,682
I do.

60
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:28,226
I love you.

61
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:31,646
Yuri.

62
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,023
I love you.

63
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:37,235
Saying it too many times

64
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:39,487
might make my heart burst.

65
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:45,034
I'll never let you go. Never.

66
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:47,704
So I'm going to keep making you

67
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:51,916
go crazy about me
from your head to your toes.

68
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:21,112
Look at these earrings.

69
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:24,574
These are made from the bullet
that was shot at me.

70
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:27,243
What? Bullet?

71
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:28,328
Yes.

72
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:33,958
I got them made so you can remember me
when we're apart.

73
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:38,212
But there's another meaning to them.

74
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:40,340
What is it?

75
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:43,092
It's proof that you're my lover.

76
00:05:48,806 --> 00:05:51,225
I can take sole possession
of your piercing holes too, right?

77
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:55,355
How weighty these earrings are...

78
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:06,616
Mr. Oya.

79
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:16,209
I pledge to stay with you

80
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:19,796
until the day you die.

81
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:24,092
Yuri.

82
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:31,099
I want to make
any wish of yours come true.

83
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:35,770
That's the courtesy given to a woman
who decides to be with a man in my world.

84
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:43,569
I promise to always love you.

85
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:50,368
Until the day I die.

86
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:15,977
I'll keep them on all the time.

87
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,645
I want to give you something in return.

88
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:19,897
You don't have to give me anything, Yuri.

89
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:24,360
You showed your resolve to be my lover.

90
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:27,029
That's the greatest luxury I could have.

91
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:29,866
Boss.

92
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:31,576
It's time.

93
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:32,618
Yes. All right.

94
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:35,830
I have to go.

95
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:43,254
Uh, Mr. Oya.

96
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:45,506
What, Yuri?

97
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:49,218
Before you go,

98
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:51,596
I want you to hug me.

99
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:57,894
I was going to.
It's like you read my mind.

100
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:02,607
Yuri.

101
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:06,736
I miss you already.

102
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:16,120
Yuri.

103
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:19,707
I'll call you again, if I'm still alive.

104
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:24,212
Yes.

105
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:42,438
I don't know when I'll see him again.

106
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,191
I can't tell anyone about him.

107
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:48,528
He's my secret lover.

108
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:56,994
What are you doing?

109
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,956
I'm looking for a high-paying job.

110
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:02,917
I just want to make a lot of money
in about two months.

111
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:05,711
Why? Are you buying a present for someone?

112
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:08,506
Yeah. I want to give my mother
a luxury-brand item.

113
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:09,882
Really?

114
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:12,218
Are you sure
you don't have a new boyfriend?

115
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,720
Those earrings
might be a present from him.

116
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:17,014
No. My mother gave them to me.

117
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:18,933
I wish I had a boyfriend.

118
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:21,310
I'm lying to my friend.

119
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:25,189
If I told her the truth,
she would try to stop me.

120
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:27,900
Oh, I know what you can do.

121
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:29,318
What is it?

122
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,404
A helper at a high-end club.

123
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:32,446
Huh?

124
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:34,782
When appointed hostesses are busy,

125
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:37,535
the helper fills in
until they're available.

126
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:40,871
Thanks, but I don't think that's for me.

127
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:43,124
I guess not.

128
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:45,126
Although it pays 3,000 yen an hour.

129
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:47,003
What, 3,000 yen an hour?

130
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:48,129
Yeah.

131
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:51,299
Hook me up.

132
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:55,928
I don't really want to do it,

133
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:59,265
but I can give Mr. Oya
a nicer present this way.

134
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:01,934
He said I don't have to,

135
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:04,020
but I can't forgive myself if I don't.

136
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:08,149
This is Sakura, a newcomer.

137
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:11,611
Thank you very much for coming.

138
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:12,653
My name is Sakura.

139
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:15,031
Very nice to meet you.

140
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:18,117
That Choko is so popular,
I have to wait my turn.

141
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:21,662
Please settle for being with me
for just a while.

142
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:25,249
-Sure. No problem, so come.
-Come sit with us.

143
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,460
To give something nice back to Mr. Oya,

144
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:31,589
I'll endure two months of heavy makeup
and fake business smiles.

145
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:34,342
Hey. That girl...

146
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:36,927
-Is she new here?
-Yes, she is.

147
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:39,013
-She's cute.
-Thank you, sir.

148
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:41,182
-Thanks.
-My pleasure.

149
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:49,857
Sakura.

150
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:53,361
You're getting tons of appointments
and business cards.

151
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:55,029
Tons?

152
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:58,324
That gentleman there, and that one too.

153
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:02,453
Are you interested
in officially working here?

154
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:05,206
We'll pay you eight times
what we pay you now.

155
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:07,124
Eight times?

156
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:12,546
-Sure. You look promising.
-Huh?

157
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:15,383
She's the number one hostess here.
She can't be wrong.

158
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:17,134
I agree with her.

159
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:21,347
I'm flattered, but...

160
00:11:22,556 --> 00:11:27,478
But I would become so busy.
What if Mr. Oya calls?

161
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:28,646
I don't want to miss it.

162
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:30,606
Well...

163
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:34,235
I'm sorry, but I'll have to turn it down.

164
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:39,532
Is it because you have a boyfriend?

165
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:44,578
I guess it can't be helped, then.

166
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:47,957
There's nothing I can say.

167
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,084
Thank you for understanding.

168
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:55,923
I won't give up yet. Because...

169
00:11:56,006 --> 00:11:58,467
Ma'am, Mr. Oya has arrived.

170
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:03,055
Mr. Oya? Surely not...

171
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:04,432
It can't be!

172
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,738
It's really him!

173
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:20,781
Welcome to our club.

174
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:23,993
His surprise entrance
makes him look even more amazing!

175
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:25,202
Welcome, Mr. Oya.

176
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:26,996
What a coincidence!

177
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:30,708
It's no time to be feeling lucky.

178
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:34,670
I've got to hide the fact
that I work here.

179
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:37,381
Although he's always so nice,

180
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:39,800
he might become angry with me about this.

181
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:43,304
How is the club doing tonight?

182
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:46,265
Our business is booming, as you can see.

183
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:50,853
It's thanks to you, Mr. Oya,
for presiding over the clubs in this area.

184
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:53,272
Does that mean...

185
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:56,317
-He rules the nightlife in this area?
-Yes, sir.

186
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:58,110
Welcome, Mr. Oya.

187
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:00,821
We're delighted you came by.
I'm so happy to see you.

188
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:02,114
Choko.

189
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:03,699
Let me show you to your seat.

190
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,209
Oh yes, Mr. Oya.

191
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:19,715
This is Sakura, our latest rising star.

192
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:24,303
She's still only a helper,

193
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:26,222
but I'm trying to persuade her.

194
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,098
-Ma'am, I can't--
-Then...

195
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:34,647
Your first appointment will be with me.

196
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:43,113
She will show you to your seat right away.

197
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:45,199
-Uh, wait a min--
-Let's go.

198
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:47,159
Sakura.

199
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:57,545
Why appoint me? I wonder...

200
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:04,760
Sorry to keep you wai-- Ah! I'm so sorry!

201
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:06,762
Please excuse me. I'm sorry.

202
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:08,806
Why are you so nervous?

203
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:11,225
Um, why...

204
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:14,228
Perhaps he's mad at me?

205
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:16,438
How embarrassing, Sakura.

206
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:19,149
Mr. Oya, she's nervous because
you're so attractive.

207
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,443
She's usually great at this,

208
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:24,488
and there's no doubt
she'll be a major force for this club.

209
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:27,241
No, I'm not great at serving customers.

210
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:28,909
Mr. Oya,

211
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:32,246
there are so many gentlemen
who want to have an appointment with her.

212
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:34,790
But I already declined.

213
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:38,294
He doesn't need to hear about
something like that... right?

214
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:39,670
I'm interested.

215
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:42,256
-Huh?
-How much are they willing to pay?

216
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,967
-I'd love to hear more.
-What?

217
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:47,094
Well, it's really amazing.

218
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:50,264
I see.

219
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:53,267
They're all from prominent companies.

220
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:00,608
Your future looks bright.

221
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:02,568
Sakura.

222
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,947
So how do you see it, Ma'am?

223
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:09,658
Huh? What does that mean?

224
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:12,995
Does he want me to be with other men?

225
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:15,331
A man like you should be able to tell

226
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:17,917
from just looking at these business cards.

227
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:19,376
Very well.

228
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:22,922
Then...

229
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:34,767
The money these men
were willing to pay for Sakura?

230
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:37,061
I'll pay instead.

231
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:38,646
Why would you do that, Mr. Oya?

232
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:40,356
What's going on?

233
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:44,068
If these guys are persistent,
then tell them this.

234
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:46,862
Sakura will never come back
to this nightlife world.

235
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:53,035
Because she's the beloved lover of
the underboss of the Oya syndicate.

236
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:02,086
If you'll excuse me.

237
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:15,599
What's her name?

238
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:16,558
Sakura.

239
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,143
Her real name!

240
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:20,062
She's Yuri, a college student.

241
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:24,066
Yuri, huh?

242
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:27,027
A college student.

243
00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:41,375
Um, Mr. Oya? The money you mentioned...

244
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:44,211
It's my fault for working here, so--

245
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:45,212
Yuri.

246
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:54,346
Do you understand the meaning
of those business cards?

247
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,727
Those cards...

248
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:03,564
mean that they'll surely
make you their mistress.

249
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:14,366
I can't believe I wasn't the first to see
you looking so beautiful.

250
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:19,455
Yuri.

251
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:23,792
You've got a lot of courage,
making me jealous like this.

252
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:29,465
We're heading home.

253
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:30,883
Are you sure?

254
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:32,551
I have one hour before my next job.

255
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:45,606
We have 45 minutes till my next job.
We'll leave 10 minutes before.

256
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:48,400
You're in trouble.

257
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,236
There's not much time left.

258
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:56,408
I'm not going to move anymore.

259
00:17:57,659 --> 00:17:58,660
You mean...

260
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:01,497
Yuri, you must bring me
to the peak of pleasure.

261
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,335
I know there's no time

262
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:09,046
and I know I have to move.

263
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:10,589
But...

264
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:13,759
Mr. Oya is being so calm,

265
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:15,677
it's making me embarrassed.

266
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:17,888
Yuri, hurry.

267
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:20,534
Your shy expression
is what's cute about you.

268
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:23,871
Show it to me properly, Yuri.

269
00:19:58,822 --> 00:20:00,490
Will you forgive me?

270
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:01,950
Hm?

271
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:05,913
If you would forgive me,

272
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:07,956
I would do anything.

273
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:16,673
Those company executives are imagining
they're in bed with you like this.

274
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:19,343
That really pisses me off.

275
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:20,719
Forgive...

276
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:26,558
You're the only one...

277
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:30,145
I would do something like this with.

278
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:44,076
Yuri.

279
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:48,455
My heart and my body
is feeling so much pleasure now.

280
00:21:06,181 --> 00:21:07,015
But...

281
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:09,059
you really did surprise me.

282
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:13,855
I didn't think I would find you working
in a town I keep under my watch.

283
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:18,068
I didn't know. I'm sorry.

284
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:31,415
You must not go to
that part of town anymore.

285
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:34,710
I won't. I'll never go there.

286
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:39,631
There was a shooting there in the past.

287
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:00,986
I want to be with you like this forever.

288
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:05,032
I don't want to be separated from you.

289
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:10,412
I feel the same way, Yuri.

290
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:18,628
You have to go now, don't you?

291
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:22,299
Good luck at work.

292
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:35,812
I wish time would stand still
for everybody but us.

293
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:40,400
I'll call you again, if I'm still alive.

294
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:45,364
Yes. I'll be waiting.

295
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:55,832
Good day, sir.

296
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:58,043
-Good day, sir.
-Good day, sir.

297
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:00,379
Good day.

298
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:46,758
PREVIEW

299
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:48,760
Mr. Oya's father?

300
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:50,303
Break up with Omi.

301
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:51,888
Break your ties with the yakuza.

302
00:23:52,472 --> 00:23:53,807
Just because I know...

303
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:56,476
doesn't mean
I support your relationship with him.

304
00:23:57,227 --> 00:23:59,938
I swear I'll be the best woman for you.

305
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:00,856
