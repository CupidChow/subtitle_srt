1
00:00:01,835 --> 00:00:04,671
Mr. Oya, I...

2
00:00:04,754 --> 00:00:06,798
I know that I'm still not cool enough,

3
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:10,719
strong enough, or smart enough
to stand beside you.

4
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:13,763
I know I'm not worthy to be with you.

5
00:00:14,764 --> 00:00:17,767
But I swear I'll be...

6
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:19,769
I'll be...

7
00:00:20,895 --> 00:00:22,480
the best woman for you.

8
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:29,237
Do you know whose lover you just hurt?

9
00:00:29,946 --> 00:00:31,489
It hurts!

10
00:00:32,073 --> 00:00:32,949
So?

11
00:00:33,825 --> 00:00:36,870
You just came crawling back completely
defeated by them?

12
00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:41,833
Why didn't you bring him here,
you useless idiot?

13
00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:48,048
Still though,

14
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:51,468
I can't believe Toshiomi left you
with only those wounds.

15
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:54,471
He seems to have gone soft.

16
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:02,187
I see. It must be this girl's fault.

17
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:07,025
Why is he into such a skinny lady?
Not much to enjoy.

18
00:01:08,276 --> 00:01:11,571
I guess a bony woman would do.

19
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:18,870
The important thing is that
she's Toshiomi's woman.

20
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:22,290
Well then,

21
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:26,127
I guess I should
introduce myself to his lady.

22
00:01:36,721 --> 00:01:39,307
Huh? Um... Huh?

23
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:41,434
Uh... What?

24
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:43,144
Huh? What?

25
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:47,482
What?

26
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:51,903
Hello?

27
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:53,363
Wow!

28
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:57,617
How many houses do you own, Mr. Oya?

29
00:01:59,577 --> 00:02:00,411
Yuri.

30
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:04,082
This key is for you.

31
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:08,336
-Seriously?
-You can stay here anytime you want.

32
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:10,839
I'll try to come here
as much as possible too.

33
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:15,552
This is a place
where you and I can be alone.

34
00:02:21,432 --> 00:02:22,892
I'm so happy.

35
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:25,103
Now I can meet you more often, Mr. Oya.

36
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:28,982
Yuri.

37
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:31,109
Come this way.

38
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:50,879
Are you okay to drink now, Mr. Oya?

39
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,589
Don't you have to work later?

40
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:55,133
I'll be sleeping here tonight.

41
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:01,431
So Yuri, let's make a toast.

42
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:03,516
Let's enjoy ourselves all night.

43
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:06,686
Amazing!

44
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:11,524
Um... Mr. Oya?

45
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:14,444
-What is it?
-Uh...

46
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:18,615
You made so much time for me today,

47
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:21,618
and even had
this beautiful house ready for me.

48
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:24,037
I'm grateful for it all, but...

49
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:27,999
Why all of a sudden?

50
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:31,920
The other day,

51
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:35,256
I made you go through
a truly frightening experience.

52
00:03:36,674 --> 00:03:37,926
When you went home that day,

53
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:41,346
I thought maybe
you wouldn't answer my calls anymore.

54
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:44,474
Maybe you wouldn't see me again.

55
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:50,647
I thought you were finally done with me.

56
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:54,525
-Of course not!
-I know.

57
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:57,946
But... well...

58
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:00,323
Uh...

59
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,957
Mr. Oya, did you do all this...

60
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:14,003
so I wouldn't change my mind about you?

61
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:16,673
Surely not.

62
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:19,217
You're right.

63
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:23,429
I'm desperate now.

64
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,442
You're so cute, Mr. Oya.

65
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:45,285
Do you want to see if I really am cute?

66
00:04:58,172 --> 00:04:59,299
Mr. Oya.

67
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:19,736
Huh?

68
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:30,830
Mr. Oya must be so busy with work

69
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:33,207
that he's not been sleeping properly.

70
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:36,169
Maybe he went out of his way
to make time to meet me.

71
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:45,428
Were you that worried?

72
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,057
Who do you think we are?

73
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:51,726
Don't mess with the mafia.

74
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,984
With the appearance of the mafia,
and all those guns,

75
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:02,904
it's true that there is so much to fear.

76
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,621
Yuri.

77
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:24,634
No matter what happens,

78
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:27,011
I will never leave you.

79
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:34,143
I knew that Mr. Oya
lives with his life in constant danger

80
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,104
when I started this relationship.

81
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:37,522
Nevertheless...

82
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:43,486
I decided to be your lover.

83
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:46,155
So I thought...

84
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:49,700
no matter how hard it gets,
I should bear it.

85
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:53,246
But I can't take it anymore.

86
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,627
I want you to know
how I felt waiting for you.

87
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:02,004
I want you to listen to it all.

88
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:04,632
I want you to take it all in.

89
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:13,349
I really wasn't as strong

90
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,309
as I thought I was.

91
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:20,731
From now on,
I want to become a strong woman

92
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:24,402
who does not cause him to worry.

93
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:46,048
Forgive me, Yuri.

94
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:51,929
I still don't want to let you go.

95
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:04,817
EPISODE EIGHT: WINE AND WOUND

96
00:08:07,236 --> 00:08:11,199
YAKUZA LOVER

102
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:49,862
YAKUZA LOVER

103
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:06,462
We have given them enough warning.

104
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:09,090
If they appear again, do not hesitate.

105
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:10,132
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

106
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:16,305
Yuri. Come here.

107
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,018
If I look fearful,

108
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:22,812
Mr. Oya would worry about me.

109
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:36,117
Let's see.

110
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:38,744
Shaoxing wine, please.

111
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:39,954
Very well, sir.

112
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:47,795
Okay, Yuri. Why don't we eat?

113
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:56,387
The usual me
would be so excited about this, but...

114
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:01,851
Yes. Thank you for the meal, Mr. Oya.

115
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:05,354
Yuri, what's the matter?

116
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:07,565
You're acting differently.

117
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:12,111
Mr. Oya, I have decided.

118
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:15,156
I want to become a woman
who measures up to you.

119
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:20,578
From now on, I'm going to be calmer,
at least in front of other people.

120
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:27,877
Yuri. Just as I thought, you're the best.

121
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:31,589
Excuse...

122
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:33,215
Uh...

123
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:36,302
Don't mind us. Keep working.

124
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:39,180
-Mr. Oya, in front of people?
-Now, Yuri.

125
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:42,600
You must accept my kisses
with a resolute attitude.

126
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:46,812
My pleasure.

127
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:02,411
Ah!

128
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:07,083
I'm very sorry, Miss.
Come with me to the back right away.

129
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:08,751
It's okay.

130
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:10,961
You can start without me, Mr. Oya.

131
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:12,380
I'll be waiting.

132
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:14,131
This way, please.

133
00:11:16,717 --> 00:11:18,844
I'm so sorry about this.

134
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:21,472
I wonder if this stain can be removed...

135
00:11:22,264 --> 00:11:25,476
It's okay.
I just want to wipe off my leg a little.

136
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:33,818
Mr. Oya...

137
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:42,910
Mr. Oya!

138
00:12:09,186 --> 00:12:11,313
That's a good girl.

139
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,443
Now let's go to meet the boss.

140
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:28,122
Stop right there!

141
00:12:29,665 --> 00:12:31,083
-Don't shoot!
-But...

142
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:32,585
Don't move!

143
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,713
If you take just one more step...

144
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:39,633
her beautiful skin will have a scar.

145
00:12:40,217 --> 00:12:41,051
Don't!

146
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:44,680
Don't shoot.

147
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:48,476
Our boss was right, huh?

148
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:11,832
The Oya syndicate is soft on women.

149
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:24,637
Is that an angry face, Toshiomi?

150
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,768
I've always wanted to see that.

151
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:33,562
The furious face of Toshiomi

152
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,564
who is usually oh so calm.

153
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:37,775
Is that why you did this, Semilio?

154
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,779
We finally meet, Toshiomi.

155
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:45,658
The other day,
I sent a messenger to invite you over.

156
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:48,494
You welcomed him with such violence.

157
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:58,212
He failed to die,
so I finished him for you.

158
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:09,098
You know, Toshiomi?

159
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:12,685
I did appreciate your ability.

160
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:17,022
Making a name for yourself
in this world of ours.

161
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:19,859
That's why I wanted
a closer relationship with you.

162
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:23,654
That's why I came all the way to Japan

163
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:26,490
and sent you an invitation, but you...

164
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:35,457
You're the one who ignited my desire.

165
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,084
Toshiomi.

166
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:48,095
Aww, dear Princess...

167
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:53,767
Oh, no.

168
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:56,270
Your beloved princess

169
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:59,231
is in the arms of another man.

170
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,945
If you take one step closer,

171
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:08,157
who knows what'll happen to your princess?

172
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:22,796
We'll contact you
as soon as we're ready to invite you over.

173
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,256
Until then...

174
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:27,092
farewell, you clumsy fools.

175
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:30,387
"Mr. Oya,

176
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:32,640
I'm going with Semilio now."

177
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:35,434
"He'll warm me up real nice."

178
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:37,853
"Bye-bye!"

179
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:57,456
Boss, you saw the situation.

180
00:15:57,539 --> 00:15:59,208
-We should have just shot--
-No.

181
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:02,836
Whatever happens, we don't hurt women.

182
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:06,507
That's the creed of our syndicate.

183
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:09,301
I'll never allow you to break it.

184
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:14,014
But because of the creed,

185
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:16,558
our whole syndicate was humiliated!

186
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:17,476
Do you still think--

187
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:23,565
It's all my fault.

188
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:26,527
Let's go.

189
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:29,446
I'll make him
pay the price for his desire.

190
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:45,629
As long as you're with me,

191
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:48,173
I need you to look
as beautiful as you can.

192
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:52,136
Hmm.

193
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,764
You're too pretty to just use as a pawn.

194
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:05,441
Oh, that's too bad.

195
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:07,735
I wanted to awaken you with my kiss.

196
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:23,625
You should feel honored.

197
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:28,338
Only the women who are chosen by me
can enter this room.

198
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,966
Because I'm the boss.

199
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:38,182
It's been a long time, Mr. Oya.

200
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:40,142
Our boss is calling for you.

201
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:43,353
This guy's the boss?

202
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:48,776
Mr. Oya...

203
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:50,319
Ah.

204
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:54,448
Toshiomi is probably
heading over here to save you right now.

205
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,201
If that's true,

206
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,703
I'm glad Mr. Oya is all right....

207
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:06,418
You're the one who was kidnapped
and you're worried about him?

208
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:08,378
How loyal of you.

209
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:10,714
Or is it...

210
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:15,010
because you believe
you'll be rescued for sure?

211
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:25,270
You're gonna be my lover
from today onwards.

212
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,773
Do you understand the meaning of this?

213
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:34,238
This middle finger is reserved for you.

214
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:37,533
Watch.

215
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,836
If you mention
your former boyfriend again,

216
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:52,005
you'll be severely punished, young lady.

217
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:08,230
Your name is Yuri, right?

218
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:11,525
Don't be afraid.

219
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:15,279
I'm a nice person
as long as you don't make a mistake.

220
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:17,531
Listen, Yuri.

221
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:20,784
I want you to tell me
who you want us to kill.

222
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:24,121
You must have someone, right?

223
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:26,623
Some friend or acquaintance
that you don't like?

224
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:30,711
I'll get rid of them for you, Yuri.

225
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:39,303
He must be joking.
I feel like throwing up.

226
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:42,556
I want to tell him exactly how I feel.

227
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:46,560
But my voice won't come out.
I'm unable to move.

228
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:50,814
Although I decided
I want to become a strong woman,

229
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:52,399
I'm still not...

230
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:57,863
You look like a cornered mouse.

231
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:01,158
This weakling is Toshiomi's woman?

232
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:03,911
I feel sorry for him.

233
00:20:06,788 --> 00:20:08,665
Are you really a yakuza's woman?

234
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:10,792
You're such a wimp.

235
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:12,628
Poor baby.

236
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:14,755
You look beautiful,

237
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:17,841
but you're still only a bud.

238
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,845
But don't worry about it, Yuri.

239
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,182
I'll teach you everything, step by step.

240
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:32,105
First, place a kiss where you belong.

241
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:34,733
Right here.

242
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:39,279
I'll make you the most perfect woman.

243
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:42,491
These awful people

244
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:45,118
disturbed my time with Mr. Oya

245
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:46,578
and mocked us.

246
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:50,123
I said, kiss it!

247
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:53,043
I'm frightened.

248
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:54,962
But...

249
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:58,423
I can't just let them say
I'm not good enough for Mr. Oya.

250
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:08,934
How dare you!

251
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,066
Don't touch me!

252
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:19,736
I won't let anyone touch me

253
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,363
except for Mr. Oya.

254
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:26,285
I was planning to be gentle with you.

255
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:32,874
It's punishment time, young lady.

256
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:37,879
Stop!

257
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:41,633
Don't touch me!

258
00:22:27,095 --> 00:22:28,221
Semilio.

259
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:32,309
I came to fulfill your desire.

260
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:39,649
Mr. Oya...

261
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:32,577
PREVIEW

262
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:34,746
Are you confident you'll satisfy me?

263
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:36,540
All I have is confidence.

264
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:38,208
Let's make a toast.

265
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:39,751
Look, Toshiomi.

266
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:41,378
I got it from Yuri.

267
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:43,380
It's proof that we're lovers.

268
00:23:44,005 --> 00:23:46,174
I'm not letting anybody have Yuri.

269
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:49,094
If I'm alive,
I'll be coming back to you first thing.

270
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:51,304
Go home first, Yuri.

271
00:23:51,721 --> 00:23:52,556
I love you.

272
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:55,058
Mr. Oya.

273
00:23:55,725 --> 00:23:57,018
I love you so much.

274
00:23:57,769 --> 00:23:59,688
Yuri, I love you.

275
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:00,856
