1
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:04,254
I said stop!

2
00:00:04,337 --> 00:00:06,756
Don't ruin this precious bar of hers.

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,092
I should discipline you punks.

4
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:11,136
You must break up with Omi.

5
00:00:11,636 --> 00:00:13,596
Break your ties with the yakuza.

6
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,932
I know I'm foolish for thinking this way.

7
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:16,850
But...

8
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:19,102
I care for Mr. Oya so much.

9
00:00:19,936 --> 00:00:21,438
I can't break up with him.

10
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:23,732
She's such a reckless girl.

11
00:00:23,815 --> 00:00:24,983
If you keep her near,

12
00:00:25,066 --> 00:00:27,569
she might be the one
who'll put you in danger.

13
00:00:27,652 --> 00:00:29,988
Don't sell her short.

14
00:00:30,071 --> 00:00:33,867
I know that I'm still not worthy
to be with you.

15
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:37,412
But, I swear I'll be...

16
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:39,080
the best woman for you.

17
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:46,588
Yes, we finally opened.

18
00:00:46,671 --> 00:00:47,714
CONGRATULATIONS!

19
00:00:47,797 --> 00:00:51,092
Thanks to your protection, Mr. Oya,
we've opened without any problems.

20
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:52,635
I'm very grateful.

21
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:53,762
CONGRATULATIONS
FROM TOSHIOMI OYA

22
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:56,056
Oh, tomorrow?

23
00:00:56,639 --> 00:00:58,141
I'll be waiting for you.

24
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:18,661
Mr. Oya.

25
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:22,457
Mr. Oya.

26
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:24,501
Mr. Oya.

27
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:29,297
Mr. Oya.

28
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,841
Mr. Oya.

29
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:38,389
Mr. Oya.

30
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:40,141
JUNMAISHU SAKE
NATSUJUN

31
00:01:54,739 --> 00:01:55,990
Good evening…

32
00:01:57,242 --> 00:01:58,076
Oh.

33
00:01:58,493 --> 00:02:00,578
Please have a seat wherever you like.

34
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:03,748
What would you like?

35
00:02:03,998 --> 00:02:05,750
Um, okay then…

36
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:08,044
Plum wine, please.

37
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:09,129
Okay.

38
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:13,383
Uh, Ma'am.

39
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:15,802
Hmm?

40
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:19,764
Mr. Oya told me to come here.

41
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:23,518
I understand you have something for me?

42
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:31,109
She wants me to come to her bar again?

43
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:33,486
Yes, she said if it's okay with me.

44
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:34,904
So Yuri,

45
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:38,158
you should go see her when you have time.

46
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:43,663
But I thought I wasn't supposed to
get involved with the people around you.

47
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:47,584
She seemed to have something to offer you.

48
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:55,341
So Ma'am,
why did you want me to come here?

49
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:57,051
Don't worry.

50
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:00,388
This is a place where you can come
to have a drink and relax.

51
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,391
Once we get paid,

52
00:03:03,474 --> 00:03:06,186
we forget every secret
that we've heard from customers.

53
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:08,688
That's the kind of place this is.

54
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:10,356
Huh?

55
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,151
Especially when they brag
about their partners.

56
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:20,325
Does that mean you'll listen to me

57
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:23,119
talk about my relationship?

58
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:25,413
Yes, but in one ear and out the other.

59
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:29,167
We can't not listen to our customers.

60
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:33,838
My relationship with Mr. Oya

61
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:35,506
is a secret that I can't tell anyone.

62
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:38,051
That's just how it is.

63
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:42,055
But if I'm given a place
where I can tell someone…

64
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:49,145
I wonder if Mr. Oya knew about your offer

65
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,481
and told me to come here?

66
00:04:01,115 --> 00:04:02,367
Mr. Oya

67
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:04,285
is so very kind to me

68
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:06,788
even when we're apart.

69
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:18,049
Um, Ma'am?

70
00:04:20,551 --> 00:04:23,721
I've been through a lot

71
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:25,598
since I started dating Mr. Oya.

72
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:29,060
Please listen to me talk about him.

73
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:33,731
Even if it's in one ear and out the other,

74
00:04:34,148 --> 00:04:36,901
having someone listen is a luxury for me.

75
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:43,950
EPISODE FOUR:
LOVE AND JEALOUSY

76
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:50,331
YAKUZA LOVER

YAKUZA LOVER

83
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:33,166
I told him I wanted to give him something
in return for these earrings.

84
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:36,461
But he insisted
he couldn't receive anything from me.

85
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:37,462
He's so stubborn!

86
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:41,591
Isn't it natural for me
to want to give him a present too?

87
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:45,094
So I worked really hard
at a part-time job.

88
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:47,013
And bought these for him.

89
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:51,100
Cuff links with a cherry blossom design.

90
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:58,149
He'll say he doesn't want them,

91
00:05:58,232 --> 00:06:01,819
but I know he'll be happy inside.

92
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,157
You really like him a lot, don't you?

93
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:07,825
Yes.

94
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:10,995
I enjoy talking about Mr. Oya.

95
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:29,847
Welcome.

96
00:06:31,265 --> 00:06:32,767
Ma'am, guess what?

97
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:35,144
Mr. Oya came to my bar.

98
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:38,689
Oh?

99
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:43,236
Uh, I used to work at the hostess club.

100
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:48,241
-Sure. You look promising.
-Huh?

101
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:51,035
I remember you well.

102
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:53,121
I didn't expect to see you here.

103
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:55,665
How is your new bar doing?

104
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:59,085
Choko opened her own bar recently.

105
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:02,255
Fortunately, business is good.

106
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:06,551
I had time off today,
so I went on a shopping spree.

107
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:08,803
That's nice. Is sake alright with you?

108
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:16,102
Did she…

109
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:18,688
just mention Mr. Oya?

110
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,481
I think she did.

111
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:23,985
The other hostesses
at the club were pretty,

112
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:26,779
but this woman is…

113
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:29,574
exceptionally pretty.

114
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:32,118
I wonder if Mr. Oya

115
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:35,413
frequents her bar too?

116
00:07:41,377 --> 00:07:43,129
Uh… What?

117
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:47,300
I was thinking how cute you are.

118
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:48,551
Huh?

119
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:54,432
It's getting late.
Don't you think you should be going home?

120
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:55,516
Right.

121
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:57,977
It's dangerous around here at night.

122
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:01,063
And you're such a cute girl.

123
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:05,401
I guess I should,
after I finish this drink. Thank you.

124
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:21,292
Could that be for Mr. Oya--

125
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:22,877
MR. OYA

126
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:25,463
Excuse me.

127
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:50,071
Ma'am, another drink.

128
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:52,156
Coming up.

CLUB CILIEGIO
CHOKO

130
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:27,817
I'm gonna make him mine for sure.

131
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:33,030
Did you say something?

132
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:40,371
No. I just had a man I love in mind.

133
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,507
Mr. Oya.

134
00:09:52,466 --> 00:09:55,886
Thank you for telling me
to visit Ma'am's bar.

135
00:09:57,638 --> 00:10:00,057
I'm glad I made you happy, Yuri.

136
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,355
Yuri, I have to go now.

137
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,650
Good night, Yuri.

138
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:18,409
-Ma'am, check please--
-Whoa!

139
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:21,912
Are you alright?

140
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:24,707
How embarrassing… I fell so hard.

141
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,042
Are you okay?

142
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,793
What are you doing?

143
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:29,712
I can't believe how clumsy I am.

144
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:31,172
You're leaving now, right?

145
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:32,632
Um, yes.

146
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:38,721
Thank you for the drink, Ma'am.

147
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:39,722
You're welcome.

148
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:42,933
See you again.

149
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:10,419
Oh no!

150
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:12,630
The bag got crumpled!

151
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:15,633
But how… I can't believe it.

152
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:18,511
I hope nothing inside got damaged.

153
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:25,810
Huh? It's not the cuff links…

154
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:28,562
What? Why?

155
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:30,564
Huh? Oh no…

156
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:36,696
What's this?

-Ma'am, check please--
-Whoa!

159
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:43,411
Did the bag get switched

160
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:45,121
when she fell?

161
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:51,377
But…

162
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:56,298
I can't contact people there
without Mr. Oya's permission.

163
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,261
You must not go to
that part of town anymore.

164
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:02,972
I won't. I'll never go there.

165
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:07,560
There was a shooting there in the past.

166
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:12,523
What should I do?

167
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:16,944
What if she needs this present right now?

168
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:20,239
What if she doesn't realize
that they've been switched

169
00:12:20,322 --> 00:12:21,991
and gives my gift to somebody?

170
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:38,632
Hello?

171
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:40,259
Hello.

172
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:43,596
We met at Ma'am's bar today.

173
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:47,641
I think our bags got switched.

174
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:50,227
What? Are you sure?

175
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:52,772
Maybe it happened when I fell.

176
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:54,732
I'm so sorry.

177
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:01,030
Thank you.

178
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:04,366
It was a very important present.

179
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,995
Can you give it to me tonight?

180
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:11,165
I'll let you know
where we should meet later.

181
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:12,500
See you then.

182
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:24,845
I NEED A FAVOR.

183
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:28,474
AN ATTACK ON A GIRL.
REWARD IS ONE MILLION YEN.

184
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:34,855
ROGER THAT.

185
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:37,358
LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT MILLION.

186
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:45,157
I'll have them attack her.

187
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:49,578
Then I'll show up to rescue her
just in the nick of time.

188
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:53,165
Mr. Oya will hear about what happened.

189
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:56,293
It would make him obliged to me.

190
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:58,504
Then I should have a chance
to be alone with him.

191
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,258
Things will change when that happens.

192
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:04,343
That dumb girl is no match for me.

193
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:06,428
Things have to work out.

194
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:12,935
Otherwise, these five years
of working so hard will all be in vain.

195
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:15,437
This bar of mine as well…

196
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:17,022
will all be for nothing!

197
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:27,658
FIVE YEARS AGO

198
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:31,036
I will be taking over from my father
to control this part of town.

199
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,496
We are grateful for your help.

200
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:33,831
This way, please.

201
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:36,500
-Mr. Oya!
-Mr. Oya!

202
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:39,128
So the rumors were true!
He's very attractive!

203
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:42,673
You're so handsome!
It's an honor to meet you!

204
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:45,301
I fell in love in that single moment.

205
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,931
The new underboss is cool, isn't he?

206
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:52,182
Do you think so?

207
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:54,977
I guess we'll see how he does.

208
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:58,272
How classy of you,
like a true number one hostess.

209
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:01,984
Which one of us will you choose?

210
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:03,611
Foolish girls.

211
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:08,490
Do they think they'll be chosen
just by fawning over him?

212
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,077
I'm Choko, the number one hostess here.

213
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:16,749
I'm planning to
open my own bar in the future.

214
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:20,794
Will you be able to protect my bar
when it opens?

215
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:23,380
I was going to stay formal

216
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,799
until I won his trust.

217
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,551
You're ambitious.

218
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:30,471
I have high expectations for you, Choko.

219
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:33,766
Mr. Oya, please come this way.

220
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:41,065
So as not to betray his expectations,

221
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:44,234
I did everything I could
to stay number one.

222
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:46,236
And…

223
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,614
Mr. Oya, I've been waiting for you.

224
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:50,658
I'm surprised you really came.

225
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:51,951
It's part of my job.

226
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:54,244
How is it going? Any problems?

227
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:57,665
No problems at all.
I'll show you to the seats in the back.

228
00:15:57,748 --> 00:15:59,083
I'm relieved you're doing well.

229
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:01,377
Now... I have to leave.

230
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:06,632
Mr. Oya,

231
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:09,635
since my bar opened,

232
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:12,221
please feel free to visit here too,

233
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:13,806
not just Ma'am's place.

234
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:17,184
Sorry. I'm already much obliged to Ma'am.

235
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,146
I will come to check again, Choko.

236
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:24,400
Tonight,

237
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:27,444
I'm in a hurry to meet my lover.

238
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:33,534
Oh, I-I didn't know that
you were in a hurry.

239
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:36,495
Take care, Mr. Oya.

240
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:15,159
Hey babe.

241
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:18,537
Good evening.

242
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:19,872
Are you waiting for someone?

243
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:22,624
Don't you wanna hang out with us a bit?

244
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:25,419
-Hey babe.
-Where are you going?

245
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:27,421
-Hey.
-Hey wait.

246
00:17:27,504 --> 00:17:28,756
Where are you going?

247
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:31,300
Let's hang out.

248
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:33,052
Okay?

249
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:35,054
Come hang out with us.

250
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:44,229
Oh, are we playing tag?

251
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:46,982
-Hey babe, where are you going?
-You run pretty fast.

252
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,026
Don't go that way. It's dangerous.

253
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,570
Feel more scared.

254
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:53,739
Feel more cornered.

255
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:56,200
-Hey babe.
-Wait up.

256
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:58,243
Hey babe. Where are you going?

257
00:17:58,327 --> 00:17:59,703
She's running faster now.

258
00:18:07,961 --> 00:18:09,046
Hey babe.

259
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:11,465
Wait up.

260
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:15,844
She finally stopped for us.

261
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:20,099
-You must be tired.
-Come with us now.

262
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:23,018
The weaker she gets,

263
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:26,563
the more grateful she'll be
when I show up to save her.

264
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:35,989
Wait. What?

265
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:37,574
It can't be...

266
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:16,530
I'm glad I decided to make the call.

267
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:21,368
Hello?

268
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:23,453
Uh, hello?

269
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:26,957
I'm sorry I called you
instead of waiting for your call.

270
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:30,752
I have a problem
I want to discuss with you.

271
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:32,838
You called at the right time.

272
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:35,215
I was about to call you, Yuri.

273
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:36,717
Huh?

274
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,719
Ma'am contacted me.

275
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:41,722
She said to stay away from Choko.

276
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:54,818
-W-Wait a minute.
-Ah?

277
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:57,905
We were only hired by that woman
who promised us money.

278
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:04,745
I-It's the truth.
We didn't really want to. Believe us.

279
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:14,296
You like playing tag, huh?

280
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:17,049
I'll play with you as you wish.

281
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:20,886
Now it's my turn to be "it."

282
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:54,002
Mr. Oya. Please don't hurt them.

283
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,462
I'm just going to ask questions.

284
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:56,588
Please.

285
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:23,156
Okay.

286
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:36,837
I didn't know you could...

287
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:39,881
look at a woman like that.

288
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:48,765
So that's how you look at her.

289
00:22:14,207 --> 00:22:16,376
I'm not gonna ask questions here
in front of everybody.

290
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:20,297
We can take our time and talk in private.

291
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:26,595
This is not...

292
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:30,265
what I had hoped for at all.

293
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:51,828
Hello, you guys.

294
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:55,332
Don't you get tired of
coming here every day?

295
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:59,086
We're detectives. It's part of our job.

296
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:46,842
PREVIEW

297
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:49,678
Are you going to kill me now?

298
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:51,054
-Yuri!
-Jin!

299
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,723
Do you know how much effort I put

300
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:56,059
into making you mine?

301
00:23:56,143 --> 00:23:57,894
It might get a little violent.

302
00:23:57,978 --> 00:24:00,021
If you're going down the wrong path,
I'll stop you.

303
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:00,939
