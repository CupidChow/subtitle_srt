1
00:00:01,668 --> 00:00:03,169
I'm looking for a high-paying job.

2
00:00:03,253 --> 00:00:05,171
I just want to make a lot of money.

3
00:00:05,255 --> 00:00:07,048
Thank you very much for coming.

4
00:00:07,132 --> 00:00:07,966
My name is Sakura.

5
00:00:08,049 --> 00:00:10,468
Sure. You look promising.

6
00:00:11,052 --> 00:00:12,470
I agree with her.

7
00:00:12,554 --> 00:00:14,431
The money these men
were willing to pay for Sakura?

8
00:00:15,056 --> 00:00:16,266
I will pay instead.

9
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:18,435
Sakura will never come back
to this nightlife world.

10
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:21,563
Because she's the beloved lover of
the underboss of the Oya syndicate.

11
00:00:23,648 --> 00:00:26,443
You've got a lot of courage,
making me jealous like this.

12
00:00:27,152 --> 00:00:29,279
If you would forgive me,

13
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:31,197
I would do anything.

14
00:00:31,948 --> 00:00:33,742
I promise to always love you.

15
00:00:34,993 --> 00:00:37,120
Until the day I die.

16
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:40,373
I don't know when I'll see him again.

17
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:42,751
I can't tell anyone about him.

18
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:45,628
He's my secret lover.

19
00:00:51,676 --> 00:00:53,011
Good day, sir.

20
00:00:53,803 --> 00:00:55,305
-Good day, sir.
-Good day, sir.

21
00:01:10,278 --> 00:01:11,529
Good day.

22
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:35,678
I really wanted to see you, Mr. Oya.

23
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:40,433
Me too. I really wanted to see you.

24
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:43,269
Where are we going?

25
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:45,772
Actually, Yuri...

26
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:48,900
I only have 30 minutes to spare.

27
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:52,862
I'm sorry.

28
00:01:53,696 --> 00:01:54,614
Huh?

29
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:57,867
You came to see me even though
you didn't have time?

30
00:01:58,618 --> 00:01:59,661
I'm so glad.

31
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:01,079
You make me so happy.

32
00:02:01,162 --> 00:02:02,413
Thank you, Mr. Oya.

33
00:02:03,581 --> 00:02:05,500
-Then let's talk here for 30 min--
-It's not fair.

34
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:10,046
I'm the one who's happy because of you.

35
00:02:20,723 --> 00:02:22,225
-We'll be seen.
-It's okay.

36
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:24,227
They can't see us from outside.

37
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:27,522
Your face is so cute when I kiss you.

38
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:29,732
I'd never let another man see it.

39
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:49,919
Yuri, sit up.

40
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:03,266
This is so soothing.

41
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:05,268
Yuri.

42
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:07,353
Yuri.

43
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,397
Uh... Huh?

44
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:12,066
Mr. Oya is cuddling me!

45
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:15,862
Is it because he's worn out from work?

46
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:21,034
This makes me happy, because
I'm usually the one doing the cuddling.

47
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:26,664
There, there.

48
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:28,791
Oops!

49
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:31,252
Holding him like this...

50
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:33,004
Am I being too cheeky?

51
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:37,175
But he feels so precious to me.

52
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:45,558
Keep doing it.

53
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,271
Yuri.

54
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,235
Like that.

55
00:03:56,152 --> 00:03:57,237
Okay.

56
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:09,082
Mr. Oya,

57
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:14,462
is there anything else I can do for you?

58
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:17,048
You could ask me anything.

59
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:19,801
Because this is our relationship.

60
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,013
Well...

61
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:27,684
Just call my name a lot.

62
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:31,896
And kiss me a lot.

63
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:40,363
Mr. Oya.

64
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,118
Mr. Oya.

65
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:49,038
Any time we meet...

66
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:55,336
could be the last.

67
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:02,385
EPISODE THREE:
FATHER AND SON

68
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:08,766
YAKUZA LOVER

69
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:16,566
YUTA FURUKAWA
AS TOSHIOMI OYA

70
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:21,654
FUMIKA BABA
AS YURI

71
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:25,992
SHIZUKA NAKAMURA

72
00:05:28,619 --> 00:05:30,288

MARIO KUROBA

74
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:47,430
YAKUZA LOVER

75
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:50,391
A judo club? You?

76
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:52,810
Yeah. I joined last week.

77
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:54,062
What?

78
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:58,232
Hey, Yuri!

79
00:05:58,316 --> 00:06:00,526
Why do you need to get stronger
than you already are?

80
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,862
You'll get less and less
attractive to guys.

81
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:06,282
Well... I want to stay strong.

82
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:09,160
I'm retraining right from the start.

83
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:12,038
I don't get it. Does that mean...

84
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:15,291
you won't go with me
to the new pancake shop?

85
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:18,127
Hmm? Why?
I don't have training today, so I'm in.

86
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:20,588
Okay. Let's go.

87
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:22,799
Pancakes!

88
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:25,176
Pancakes!

89
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:27,678
Mr. Oya lives in constant danger.

90
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:33,017
The least I can do is
learn to defend myself.

91
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:37,313
Pancakes!

92
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:39,107
-Pancakes!
-Pancakes!

93
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,274
-Pancakes!
-Sakura.

94
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:43,194
Oh, I forgot.

95
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:45,947
You're Yuri here, right?

96
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:50,660
Sakura will never come back
to this nightlife world.

97
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:54,872
Because she's the beloved lover of
the underboss of the Oya syndicate.

98
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:04,590
This is... awkward.

99
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:07,176
I left her club that day

100
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:10,138
without even saying goodbye to her.

101
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:14,684
Do you have some free time?

102
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:17,353
Why don't we talk a little?

103
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:29,907
Ma'am, I didn't know you had another bar.

104
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:31,701
It's very nice.

105
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:34,912
It's not open yet.
Make yourself comfortable.

106
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:39,375
Um...

107
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:42,295
So, why am I here?

108
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:46,424
I was a little bit worried.

109
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:53,681
You and Mr. Oya...

110
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,602
How are you getting along?

111
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:04,650
I know that he's a gentleman,
although he lives in that rough world.

112
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:08,738
But I was concerned about you.

113
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:13,409
Well, I'm glad that you're happy with him.

114
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:25,004
Why do you look surprised?

115
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:29,884
I've never talked about Mr. Oya

116
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:32,637
with anybody else like this.

117
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:37,475
And I don't intend to tell anyone.

118
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:41,604
But having someone who knows about us

119
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:43,189
kind of...

120
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,526
makes me feel more courageous.

121
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:53,366
Listen.

122
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:55,993
Just because I know...

123
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:02,500
doesn't mean
I support your relationship with him.

124
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:07,463
Yes.

125
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:09,924
Thank you.

126
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:25,982
Can I have a drink too?

127
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:27,233
Of course, come in.

128
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:30,945
Thank you for patronizing my bar.

129
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:32,029
Thanks.

130
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:35,116
He must be a regular customer.

131
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:37,326
He has a distinct air about him.

132
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:40,037
Sorry to interrupt, young lady.

133
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:41,038
Huh?

134
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:44,959
I interrupted your little meeting.

135
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:46,877
Let me buy you a drink as an apology.

136
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:48,421
No, you don't have to.

137
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:50,756
You should take him up on his kind offer.

138
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,841
Umm...

139
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:56,178
I'll go lock the door.

140
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:58,306
What?

141
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:01,684
Not so fast!

142
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:03,686
You just got two more customers.

143
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:05,730
You guys again.

144
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:09,233
We're coming in, ready or not.

145
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:12,028
Why are you here?

146
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:14,655
We don't need you to protect my bar.

147
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:17,116
I've told you that many times already.

148
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:18,534
Don't you know, Ma'am?

149
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,954
This area is not safe these days.

150
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:24,582
Yes. I can give you an example...

151
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:33,799
Bad guys doing things like this
are pretty rampant.

152
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,010
We're not like that, mind you.

153
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:38,471
What we're doing is just...

154
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:42,933
telling you what could happen.

155
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:48,648
Hey, stop it already--

156
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:51,734
If you don't stop, I'll call the police!

157
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:54,195
Don't ruin this precious bar of hers!

158
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,616
Keep quiet!

159
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:00,701
I said, stop!

160
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:13,005
Come now!

161
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:15,424
-Oww!
-Hey!

162
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:18,260
Are you all right?

163
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:19,887
Oww.

164
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:23,724
Why you...

165
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,768
Take this!

166
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:33,150
You idiot.

167
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,529
Don't you know
which syndicate we're from--

168
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:40,574
Listen closely, kid.

169
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:44,537
We men can make our living,

170
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:48,290
and walk around pompously
with our heads held high,

171
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:52,795
only thanks to all the women

172
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,965
who protect our stupid pride.

173
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:01,554
Maybe it's no use talking to
low-level men like you.

174
00:12:02,763 --> 00:12:04,849
Why don't you take me to your boss?

175
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:10,938
I should discipline you punks.

176
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:13,399
Let's go! This is trouble!

177
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:15,234
Why is the boss of the Oya syndicate here?

178
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:19,238
Excuse us!

179
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:26,162
The boss of the Oya syndicate?

180
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:31,792
Does that mean he's...

181
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:36,172
Mr. Oya's father?

182
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:38,507
Are you all right?

183
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:41,093
I'm fine. Thank you.

184
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:44,430
I thought if I mentioned
calling the police, they'd stop.

185
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:45,723
The chair...

186
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,725
Never mind about the chair.

187
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:50,811
I'm so glad you're okay.

188
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:52,730
Don't be reckless like that.

189
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:54,815
I'm sorry.

190
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:57,943
Young lady.

191
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:02,948
I asked her to bring you here today,

192
00:13:03,657 --> 00:13:05,701
so I could meet you.

193
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:09,163
Too bad about the interruption.

194
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:10,581
What?

195
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,793
I apologize, young lady.

196
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:17,755
I don't mean to be rude...

197
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:23,969
but you must break up with Omi.

198
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:26,847
Break your ties with the yakuza.

199
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:35,606
Why... do you say that?

200
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:41,612
I'm saying it for your own good.

201
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:49,453
I'm scared.

202
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:52,122
But...

203
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:57,211
I can't break up with him.

204
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:00,589
That's impossible.

205
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:07,263
When I'm with Mr. Oya,

206
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:10,099
there's danger involved

207
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,518
and I worry a lot.

208
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:16,272
But I chose to be with him.

209
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:20,359
All I can think of

210
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:21,819
is how to make it work.

211
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:26,323
I know I'm foolish for thinking this way.

212
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:28,450
But...

213
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:34,540
I care for Mr. Oya so much.

214
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:36,709
I can't break up with him.

215
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:42,423
I can't follow your orders, sir.

216
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:52,349
I know I'm being rebellious.

217
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:56,395
But I want to be bold

218
00:14:57,605 --> 00:14:59,773
and stay beside Mr. Oya.

219
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:18,459
I came to tell you this.

220
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:21,503
Don't interfere in our relationship.

221
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:23,464
Mr. Oya.

222
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:30,429
Omi.

223
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:34,266
Who do you think you're giving orders to?

224
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:51,367
To you.

225
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:59,458
That's enough, Boss.

226
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:12,972
See you again, Ma'am.
I'll have that drink next time.

227
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,688
Wait here.

228
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:33,075
Welcome back, sir.

229
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:34,451
-Welcome back, sir.
-Welcome back, sir.

230
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:36,078
Your car is waiting over there.

231
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:37,162
All right.

232
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:45,212
She's such a reckless girl.

233
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:47,297
If you keep her near,

234
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:49,717
she might be the one
who'll put you in danger.

235
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:54,263
She tried to take on a yakuza member.

236
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,516
It's not her first time, is it?

237
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:02,604
You're the top moneymaker
for the syndicate.

238
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:05,024
I can't let you die so easily.

239
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:08,694
This is an order from me.

240
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:16,785
You must break off the relationship.

241
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:27,713
Do you really think
she'll continue to be reckless?

242
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:33,302
I wouldn't mind at all
if she stayed that way,

243
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:37,389
but I know she wouldn't
allow that to happen.

244
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,101
So,

245
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:43,979
my answer to you is...

246
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:46,857
Don't sell her short.

247
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:48,984
That is all.

248
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:57,910
You always hated wasting time.

249
00:17:57,993 --> 00:17:59,495
Now you're enjoying it.

250
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:02,039
I don't understand.

251
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:04,833
I don't understand at all.

252
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:20,557
I wonder...

253
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:24,144
The Boss only said to her,

254
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,355
"Break your ties with the yakuza."

255
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:28,774
"It's for your own good."

256
00:18:31,026 --> 00:18:32,027
He said that?

257
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:36,240
She insisted that
she won't break up with you.

258
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:44,123
If he told her as he told you
that she might put you in danger,

259
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:48,085
that would have convinced her
to leave you.

260
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:51,964
I wonder why he didn't.

261
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:08,689
All replenished.

262
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:14,403
I'm glad I'm able to be your nourishment.

263
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:16,738
But...

264
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:21,535
Yuri?

265
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:25,914
I was so scared today.

266
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:28,876
My voice and my body were trembling

267
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:31,587
in front of the boss.

268
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:36,425
Mr. Oya, I...

269
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,012
I know that I'm still not cool enough,

270
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:44,224
strong enough, or smart enough
to stand beside you.

271
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:47,769
I know I'm not worthy to be with you.

272
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,024
But...

273
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:55,819
please stay with me.

274
00:19:58,322 --> 00:19:59,990
I swear I'll be...

275
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:01,825
I'll be...

276
00:20:03,076 --> 00:20:04,578
the best woman for you.

277
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:11,877
You know, Yuri?

278
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:13,587
Yes?

279
00:20:15,505 --> 00:20:17,674
No matter how much
your voice and your body were trembling,

280
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:20,510
you were able
to communicate your feelings.

281
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:22,679
What makes you think
you're not worthy to be with me?

282
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:24,389
What?

283
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,812
You're not uncool.

284
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:34,399
You are always dignified.

285
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:43,742
Come over here, Yuri.

286
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:47,537
It's your turn to be nourished.

287
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,754
I love you, Yuri.

288
00:20:58,382 --> 00:21:00,509
Thank you for giving me the confidence

289
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:02,177
when I was being weak

290
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:04,012
and uncool.

291
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:14,940
That tickles.

292
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:17,317
It's good to see you smile.

293
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:19,695
Mr. Oya.

294
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:22,030
I love you too.

295
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:29,037
I want to hug you even harder.

296
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:31,373
I know.

297
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,627
I have to go take care of something first.

298
00:21:38,171 --> 00:21:39,089
Huh?

299
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:47,681
Spare me.

300
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:24,009
Mr. Oya.

301
00:22:24,092 --> 00:22:26,094
I hope he comes back soon.

302
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:42,944
Mr. Oya.

303
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:46,782
Mr. Oya.

304
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:48,867
Mr. Oya.

305
00:22:52,245 --> 00:22:53,747
Mr. Oya.

306
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:55,999
Mr. Oya.

307
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:57,542
OYA SYNDICATE
TOSHIOMI OYA

308
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:49,052
I'm gonna make him mine for sure.

309
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:50,303
Mr. Oya

310
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:51,596
is so very kind to me

311
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,432
even when we're apart.

312
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:55,976
I'm glad I made you happy, Yuri.

313
00:23:56,059 --> 00:23:57,978
It's dangerous around here at night.

314
00:23:58,061 --> 00:24:00,063
And you're such a cute girl.

315
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:00,981
