1
00:00:01,751 --> 00:00:04,254
I've always wanted to see that.

2
00:00:04,337 --> 00:00:06,798
The furious face of Toshiomi

3
00:00:06,881 --> 00:00:08,675
who is usually oh so calm.

4
00:00:11,136 --> 00:00:13,763
You're the one who ignited my desire.

5
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:15,390
Toshiomi.

6
00:00:15,974 --> 00:00:17,851
It's all my fault.

7
00:00:17,934 --> 00:00:20,020
I'll make him
pay the price for his desire.

8
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:22,856
You're gonna be my lover
from today onwards.

9
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:25,066
I won't let anyone touch me

10
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:26,526
except for Mr. Oya.

11
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:29,529
It's punishment time, young lady.

12
00:00:37,954 --> 00:00:39,247
Mr. Oya…

13
00:00:40,498 --> 00:00:41,583
Semilio.

14
00:00:43,835 --> 00:00:45,962
I came to fulfill your desire.

15
00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:51,259
EPISODE NINE: ROMANCE AND BULLETS

16
00:00:53,678 --> 00:00:57,640
YAKUZA LOVER

17
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,440
YUTA FURUKAWA
AS TOSHIOMI OYA

18
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:10,528
FUMIKA BABA
AS YURI

19
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:14,866

00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:36,304
YAKUZA LOVER

23
00:01:36,387 --> 00:01:37,597
Semilio.

24
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:41,184
I came to fulfill your desire.

25
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:48,525
You don't look at all like a man
whose lover was kidnapped.

26
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:55,031
Evidently, anger makes one calm
once it reaches a certain point.

27
00:01:55,990 --> 00:02:00,662
Sorry I couldn't grant your wish
of seeing my furious face.

28
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:06,417
Not only no anger but premium whisky.
Are you trying to suck up to me?

29
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:18,596
Did you really think
I'd still have a drink with you?

30
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:22,684
I've totally lost interest
in a weak man like you!

31
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:24,894
Now,

32
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:27,814
I've developed a new desire.

33
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:31,359
Look, Toshiomi.

34
00:02:32,777 --> 00:02:35,738
Look at this red ring, throbbing sweetly.

35
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:38,366
I got it from Yuri.

36
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:40,785
It's proof that we're lovers.

37
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:43,872
No, it isn't!

38
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:46,875
What?

39
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,335
Are you finally getting mad?

40
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:51,421
Mr. Oya…

41
00:02:51,796 --> 00:02:52,755
Hey.

42
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:56,926
There is nothing uglier
than a jealous man, Toshiomi.

43
00:02:57,635 --> 00:02:58,636
Well,

44
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:02,140
I don't mind being the one
you're jealous of!

45
00:03:09,063 --> 00:03:10,064
Damn it!

46
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:19,282
Yuri is a very attractive woman.

47
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,577
I can't blame you
for being captivated, Semilio.

48
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:25,580
But…

49
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:31,294
I'm not letting anybody have Yuri.

50
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:34,505
Yuri.

51
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:37,342
I'm truly sorry.

52
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:40,595
I'm putting you in
so many dangerous situations.

53
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:43,223
Are you hurt?

54
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:45,391
-No. I'm okay.
-Wait.

55
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:46,976
Let me examine you closely.

56
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:58,529
No way…

57
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:01,324
No, it's okay, Mr. Oya.

58
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:03,243
-He hasn't done anything else to me--
-Yuri.

59
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:07,705
Mr. Oya,

60
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:09,123
now's not the time--

61
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:10,750
I have to do this now.

62
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:15,004
I'll override your bad experience.

63
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:19,092
Mr. Oya.

64
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,763
You've killed the mood!

65
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:34,482
You have terrible taste in men.

66
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:41,823
I must punish you.

67
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:05,179
Mr. Oya!

68
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:09,100
I'm all right.

69
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:10,977
Yuri.

70
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:16,149
Come on, calm down now.

71
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:19,944
Remember, you originally came for me.

72
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:22,155
So I want to do what's responsible.

73
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:26,617
Let's make a toast.

74
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:28,202
Mr. Oya?

75
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:32,623
Do you really think I'd be happy
with just some premium whisky?

76
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:35,793
Well, I brought whisky
from the year you were born.

77
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:40,798
Are you confident you'll satisfy me?

78
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:43,551
All I have is confidence.

79
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:49,724
Fine, if you insist,
I'll accept your offer.

80
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:56,606
Mr. Oya?

81
00:05:58,649 --> 00:06:00,318
Go home without me, Yuri.

82
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,793
Wait for me at my house.

83
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:19,754
You don't know how I felt
waiting for you all night.

84
00:06:19,837 --> 00:06:21,339
You don't know…

85
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:29,097
Are you hurt?

86
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,973
I suppose you're not.

87
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:37,605
Whose lover do you think you kidnapped?

88
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:39,357
You dumb kid.

89
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,859
We can take our time and talk in private.

90
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:52,495
I…

91
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:55,081
I'll go now.

92
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:05,967
Yuri.

93
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:10,012
I know how you really feel.

94
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:14,517
I know you're just saying that…

95
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:17,145
because of me.

96
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:27,029
I love you.

97
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:28,614
Yuri.

98
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:31,617
I love you so much.

99
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:47,717
With all my heart.

100
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:04,192
I love you.

101
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:06,319
Mr. Oya.

102
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:12,033
I love you so much.

103
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:16,287
With all my heart, Mr. Oya.

104
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:26,589
If I'm alive,
I'll be coming back to you first thing.

105
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,544
Today, I'm going to teach you
the way of men living in the underworld

106
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:07,380
and the correct way
to choose women, Toshiomi.

107
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,632
Believe it or not,

108
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:12,051
I actually have a caring side.

109
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:16,722
Hurry up. Pour me a drink already.

110
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:18,724
Here.

111
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:22,770
Knock yourself out.

112
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:36,450
What's the matter, Semilio?

113
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:38,828
This is the Toshiomi you wanted, right?

114
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:42,123
Don't tell me you were pretending
so I'd let Yuri go?

115
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:43,874
My syndicate was humiliated

116
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,543
and my lover was kidnapped.

117
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:48,254
Did you really think
I was smiling from my heart?

118
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:53,301
You're not getting anything,
not even her teeth marks.

119
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:56,137
Now, I'll really satisfy you!

120
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,058
Boss!

121
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:03,329
I found some dust.

122
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:04,955
Take that!

123
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:07,583
Got it.

124
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:13,714
I can't stop.

125
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:15,758
If I stop, I'll get sucked in.

126
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:25,976
Come on out, dust! I'll get you!

127
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,103
There you go.

128
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:41,826
This house is too clean.

129
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:45,496
I should exercise instead.

130
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:47,873
One.

131
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:49,959
Two.

132
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:52,336
Three.

133
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:55,297
-I can ignore my loud heartbeat
-Four.

134
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,633
-by moving my body and exercising.
-Five.

135
00:11:58,426 --> 00:11:59,343
Six.

136
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:00,970
Not done yet.

137
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:06,225
I don't want to wait like I did then.

138
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:08,394
No way.

139
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:11,939
This time,

140
00:12:12,022 --> 00:12:13,941
I won't doubt that you will come home

141
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:15,776
and I'll be waiting for you.

142
00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:51,562
Whenever he does come home,

143
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:53,898
I'll be ready.

144
00:12:56,609 --> 00:13:00,488
I'll try to be the best me at all times.

145
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:07,411
I hope this helps.

146
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:10,873
It does. It feels good.

147
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:15,336
But you really don't have to.

148
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:18,047
I don't expect this from you, Mr. Oya.

149
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:20,591
It's what I want to do for you.

150
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:24,220
You don't ask me for anything.

151
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:26,722
It's the least I can do.

152
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:33,395
The only thing I ask from you is you.

153
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:36,148
I want you, Mr. Oya.

154
00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:43,132
If I'm alive,
I'll be coming back to you first thing.

155
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:46,010
I'll call you again, if I'm still alive.

156
00:14:48,762 --> 00:14:50,431
Mr. Oya always says,

157
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:53,475
"If I'm still alive."

158
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:56,812
That's the kind of world he lives in.

159
00:14:57,229 --> 00:15:00,232
No matter how many
loving times we spend together,

160
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:02,943
he never gives me false hope.

161
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:05,946
That's why Mr. Oya

162
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:09,950
is both a cruel and an honest man.

163
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:14,163
Still,

164
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:17,291
I choose to believe him

165
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:18,959
and wait for him.

166
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:26,425
I don't know when he'll return.

167
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:28,969
But I want to be ready for him

168
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:32,723
when he does return.

169
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:39,647
But what if he doesn't return?

170
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:41,941
What should I do?

171
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:02,252
I don't want to give up.

172
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:06,382
I can't give up.

173
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:10,094
I want to continue being loved by Mr. Oya.

174
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:16,100
Mr. Oya is the one I want to touch.

175
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:18,936
You're the only one I love

176
00:16:19,561 --> 00:16:20,896
now and forever.

177
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:23,440
You're the only one for me.

178
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:37,830
Oh no. I fell asleep with my makeup on.

179
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:41,166
Even though Mr. Oya likes soft silky skin.

180
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:45,087
I'd better spend extra time
on my skincare routine today.

181
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:11,989
I'm back. Yuri.

182
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:26,503
Welcome back. Mr. Oya.

183
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:42,519
I promised myself I wouldn't cry.

184
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:51,612
I'm so happy you're alive, Mr. Oya.

185
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:13,383
I waited for you,

186
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:15,928
believing you'd come home.

187
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:25,354
How many times do you plan
on making me fall in love with you?

188
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:41,537
Yuri.

189
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:43,288
Mr. Oya.

190
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:44,957
Yuri.

191
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:46,625
Mr. Oya.

192
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:48,627
Yuri.

193
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:50,254
Mr. Oya.

194
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:52,005
Yuri.

195
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:53,340
Mr. Oya.

196
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:08,647
Yuri, I love you.

197
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:12,985
I love you too.

198
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:22,452
Mr. Oya.

199
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:25,956
I can't wait anymore.

200
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:29,626
Hurry back inside of me.

201
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:03,744
I'm here, Yuri.

202
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:06,079
I'm right here.

203
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:18,634
By the way, I got your earrings back.

204
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:21,553
Really? I'm so glad.

205
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:24,640
Those earrings.

206
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:26,975
I thought I'd never get them back.

207
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:31,230
That mafia boss took them from me,

208
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:32,564
so I never thought...

209
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:35,651
Mr. Oya.

210
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:39,821
What happened to that mafia boss?

211
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:52,960
Uh, um…

212
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:57,339
Yuri.

213
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,930
Do you really want to know?

214
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:22,489
I didn't kill him.

215
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:25,951
Huh…

216
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:28,495
Well, uh… But…

217
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,508
The truth is…

218
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:44,845
I showed everyone what happens
when I get angry.

219
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:49,725
I made an example of him
to the underworld.

220
00:21:55,939 --> 00:21:57,190
Mr. Oya.

221
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:02,195
You're really scary.

222
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:08,827
That's the best compliment for me, Yuri.

223
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:20,589
Here, Yuri.

224
00:22:21,631 --> 00:22:23,133
You should forget about him now.

225
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:26,803
He scares me,

226
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:29,598
and his love is burdening.

227
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:30,974
Yes.

228
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:39,524
I'll make it so that you can
only think about me.

229
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:41,902
But still…

230
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:46,948
he makes me want to sleep in his arms.

231
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:49,701
That's how I feel.

232
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:44,423
THIS DRAMA IS FICTIONAL.

233
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:45,841
