1
00:00:01,626 --> 00:00:04,838
Cheers!

2
00:00:08,383 --> 00:00:11,302
-Hey!
-Long time no see!

3
00:00:11,386 --> 00:00:12,595
How have you been?

4
00:00:14,472 --> 00:00:17,976
Let's drink and party like crazy today!

5
00:00:20,645 --> 00:00:22,355
Come on, it looks fun.

6
00:00:22,897 --> 00:00:24,190
-You go if you want.
-Really?

7
00:00:27,777 --> 00:00:30,780
This is different from what I thought.

8
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:31,781
Yup.

9
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:33,283
Get over here!

10
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:40,957
You two sure are cute.

11
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:43,877
So...

12
00:00:44,586 --> 00:00:47,005
How about we go have fun somewhere else...

13
00:00:47,088 --> 00:00:48,089
Come on, Yuri.

14
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:49,507
Hey!

15
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:56,556
What made you think
you could touch me like that?

16
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:00,435
I'm here to find a proper boyfriend!

17
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:11,488
To think you organized this party.

18
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:14,365
You suck. Let's go home, Mai.

19
00:01:20,705 --> 00:01:21,539
Yuri...

20
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:24,250
Try reading the room a little.

21
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:26,127
I say what's on my mind.

22
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:28,379
That guy was so rude!

23
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:31,424
You're a university student now.
You need to grow up.

24
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:33,218
You'll never find a boyfriend.

25
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:36,221
It has to be someone who likes me
just the way I am.

26
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:39,140
What the...

27
00:01:46,147 --> 00:01:47,649
Who are these people?

28
00:01:53,738 --> 00:01:55,949
Whoa. Do we know these two?

29
00:01:56,032 --> 00:01:59,452
No, idiot. And they saw us.

30
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:00,662
We're sorry!

31
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:01,871
Over here!

32
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:04,791
-Get off me!
-I will, so stop fighting!

33
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:07,335
After I make you an accomplice, that is.

34
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:11,214
Don't try to fight a man.

35
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:14,134
Here, now you're an accomplice.

36
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:15,718
Stop it!

37
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:17,428
Open your mouth!

38
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:18,763
Open it!

39
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:26,187
I played basketball in school!

40
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:28,523
And I never missed a shot!

41
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:30,733
If you come any closer...

42
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:33,528
I'll land a slam dunk on your heads!

43
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,550
What now?

44
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:06,102
Who are you?

45
00:03:09,397 --> 00:03:12,108
Sorry to interrupt the fun and games.

46
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:18,615
I'm the underboss of the Oya syndicate.

47
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:20,617
The name's Toshiomi Oya.

48
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,161
Oya syndicate?

49
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:33,171
What? Yakuza?

50
00:03:46,684 --> 00:03:47,602
Are you hurt?

51
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:51,439
I suppose you're not.

52
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:55,235
I'm glad.

53
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:05,328
Show this
if you ever get into trouble again.

54
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:06,246
TOSHIOMI OYA

55
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:09,791
Think of it as your shield.

56
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:15,630
You can keep the coat.

57
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:17,382
I'm just glad you're safe.

58
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:23,554
Don't let this stop you finding love.

59
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:29,185
Goodbye...

60
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:32,522
young lady.

61
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:37,235
Yuri...

62
00:04:49,914 --> 00:04:53,334

-What do you want to eat?
-What should I have?

71
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,507
TWO WEEKS LATER

72
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:42,675
What did you eat yesterday?

73
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:44,427
Yesterday... I forgot.

74
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,095
What? You forgot?

75
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:48,181
Yuri...

76
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:51,184
you're always carrying
that paper bag recently.

77
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:52,352
What's up with that?

78
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:56,356
It belongs to the person
who helped us at that party.

79
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:57,440
Hey!

80
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:01,569
The yakuza guy?

81
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:03,613
Was he...

82
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:06,699
a gentleman?

83
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:08,493
Or was he frightening?

84
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:11,245
I can't decide.

85
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:15,833
Do you like him?

86
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:17,543
What! Of course not.

87
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:19,128
I'm just wondering.

88
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:20,129
Yuri.

89
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:23,383
You can be grateful,
but you can't get involved.

90
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:24,467
Not with that type of guy.

91
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:25,802
I know that.

92
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:38,272
But holding on to a yakuza's coat

93
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:40,066
is just as scary as throwing it away.

94
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:44,487
Besides, not saying "thank you"
just feels weird.

95
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,156
Get a move on!

96
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,241
-Yes sir.
-Yes sir.

97
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:04,549
Welcome back.

98
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:05,758
-Welcome back.
-Welcome back.

99
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:06,884
Thank you.

100
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:11,764
I...

101
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:24,068
We meet again, young lady.

102
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:43,337
Um...

103
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:44,338
Don't worry.

104
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:48,593
This way.

105
00:07:57,351 --> 00:07:58,853
-Hey.
-Yes sir.

106
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:07,904
A present.

107
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:12,033
What? No...

108
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:15,244
I didn't bring the coat back for a reward.

109
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:16,621
It's not a reward...

110
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:19,790
I'm wooing you.

111
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,876
What?

112
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:25,254
The strength you showed
when you stood your ground

113
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:28,341
and tried to protect your friend...

114
00:08:29,383 --> 00:08:31,093
It seems I've fallen for it.

115
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,266
I thought we'd never meet again.

116
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:41,687
But here you are, delivering me my coat.

117
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:52,615
When I saw you just now...

118
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:56,118
I thought my heart stopped.

119
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:00,540
Don't get involved.

120
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:01,457
Run away!

121
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:02,375
Wait...

122
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:03,876
I'm not waiting!

123
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,045
I'm not letting
this moment of opportunity pass me by.

124
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:11,259
Sorry, but...

125
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,053
You suddenly hugged me.

126
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:15,388
You caught me by surprise.

127
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:18,599
Well, at least it's not...

128
00:09:20,017 --> 00:09:22,019
because I'm a yakuza.

129
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:26,983
What? Well...

130
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:31,779
I'll have someone take you home.

131
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:45,960
Yuri.

132
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:57,638
Wait!

133
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:03,936
My next kiss will leave you shaking...

134
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:05,980
all over.

135
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:26,208
I'm sorry. Carry on.

136
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:30,880
You're too cute.

137
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,483
Boss!

138
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:53,527
-Watch out!
-Where are they?

139
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:54,820
-Find them.
-Which way?

140
00:10:58,074 --> 00:10:59,825
I'm not hurt.

141
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:00,743
But you are...

142
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:06,874
Where's the shooter?

143
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:09,377
The shot came from far away. They're gone.

144
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:12,296
I have an idea who they might be.
We settle this today.

145
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,297
Yes sir.

146
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:20,012
This is the world he lives in.

147
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:39,281
The sound of the gunshot
is still ringing in my ears.

148
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:42,785
Someone wants him dead.

149
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,371
He could be killed at any time.

150
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:47,832
He has to be prepared for that every day.

151
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:55,256
I can't get involved with him!

152
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:07,685
UNKNOWN NUMBER
MOBILE PHONE

153
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:15,609
Hello...

154
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:19,989
Yuri... I want to meet you.

155
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:23,576
Okay.

156
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,957
Boss, I've brought her.

157
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:35,504
Thank you for coming.

158
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:45,556
I'm sorry.

159
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:50,644
To be honest...

160
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:52,521
I'm not ready for any of this.

161
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:55,566
But... I wanted to see you.

162
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:00,821
It's okay.

163
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:03,824
I won't threaten you.

164
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:06,160
You can run away at any time.

165
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:08,871
But...

166
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:12,458
now that you are here...

167
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,520
Mr. Oya...

168
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,231
What is it?

169
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:38,609
I'm scared...

170
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,487
My body feels all wrong.

171
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:43,239
I'm scared.

172
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:03,384
Yuri...

173
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:07,847
This might be the last time we have sex.

174
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:10,933
Let's feel wrong together.

175
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:40,212
I've found all the sensitive parts
of your mouth.

176
00:14:41,171 --> 00:14:43,674
Keep going. Don't stop.

177
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:51,181
It's so cute...

178
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:53,309
to see you this excited.

179
00:15:19,835 --> 00:15:21,211
Do you feel like running away?

180
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:22,922
What?

181
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:29,345
Let's end it here.

182
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:34,308
No.

183
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:36,936
I was looking at your tattoos...

184
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:40,105
because I thought they were pretty.

185
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:46,445
I won't go home.

186
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:50,032
I'm not ready to become your lover.

187
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:54,620
But, I still want to be with you, Mr. Oya.

188
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:00,751
I want to be with you.

189
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:12,763
To think that you'll stay with me.

190
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:16,058
I can't tell you how happy that makes me.

191
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:17,768
Happy?

192
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:21,438
Yeah. So happy, it's crazy.

193
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:24,483
You don't look that happy, Mr. Oya.

194
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:28,112
It's the facade of an older man.

195
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:31,073
I'm embarrassed to show you.

196
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:48,424
Now I'll find
the rest of your sensitive parts.

197
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:50,217
Okay...

198
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:10,571
My sensitive parts.

199
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:13,574
Where are they?

200
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:18,871
That's...

201
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:23,125
MOM: WHERE DID YOU GO?
THE CONVENIENCE STORE?

202
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:30,507
I don't want to leave him,

203
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:33,802
but I have to return to my world.

204
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,311
-Hey.
-Yes sir.

205
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:47,816
Take her home.

206
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:49,318
Yes sir.

207
00:17:54,364 --> 00:17:55,407
Yuri.

208
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:02,247
I'll call you again, if I'm still alive.

209
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:10,631
Can we meet again?

210
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:23,268
After that...

211
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:26,730
he never called.

212
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:31,944
That really sucked, you know!

213
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:32,861
ONE MONTH LATER

214
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:34,530
Yuri?

215
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:37,199
Yuri! Are you listening?

216
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:38,325
Oh, yeah?

217
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:41,245
What were you doing during vacation?

218
00:18:41,411 --> 00:18:43,080
-Nothing.
-You? Doing nothing?

219
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:44,123
Come on.

220
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:45,874
You've always been such a go-getter.

221
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,544
You'd do several jobs at once
during vacation.

222
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:51,004
Are you feeling okay?

223
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:52,131
What are you talking about?

224
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,341
I'm going to the next lecture.

225
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,634
What?

226
00:18:56,718 --> 00:18:59,096
Wait! Yuri!

227
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:00,013
Erina!

228
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:02,307
Long time no see!

229
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,852
-How have you been?
-I'm doing well.

230
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:11,650
I kept my schedule free,

231
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:13,944
but he never called.

232
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:17,322
My call history.

233
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:19,658
I've probably stared at it longer

234
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:20,909
than I looked at him.

235
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:35,507
An accident has caused
a huge line of traffic along this road.

236
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:37,301
Police are looking into the cause.

237
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:40,387
I'm not ready to be his lover,
but I want to meet.

238
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:43,140
That's so half-hearted.

239
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:45,809
A shooting has occurred in Shinjuku.

240
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:49,021
According to the police,
the man seen bleeding at the scene

241
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:51,315
is an executive member
of the Oya syndicate.

242
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:53,400
MAN LIVING NEAR SHINJUKU
REPORTS HEARING GUNSHOTS

243
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:56,403
Last night at around 10:00 p.m.,
a man living nearby

244
00:19:56,486 --> 00:20:00,616
reported to the police
that he heard something like gunshots.

245
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:04,203
-This person is not available.
-A man was shot in the neck and arm.

246
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:07,581
-Please leave your name, number,
-He was pronounced dead an hour later.

247
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:10,751
-and message after the tone.
-The police believe it was gang-related.

248
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:12,586
They are currently investigating further.

249
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:20,219
It's fine.

250
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:22,846
Everything will be fine.

251
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:27,142
I just have to go to the university.

252
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:42,199
Just keep moving.

253
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:45,661
Keep your mind and body moving.

254
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:47,788
Make them work.

255
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:52,209
Why can't I do anything?

256
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:56,838
No. Keep moving!

257
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:04,554
Are you dead... Mr. Oya?

258
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:30,831
I'm glad I found you.

259
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:34,293
I'm sorry I didn't answer before.

260
00:21:36,586 --> 00:21:38,088
I'm back, Yuri.

261
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:47,264
Yuri.

262
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:51,810
Being with you...

263
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:53,937
is so hard, Mr. Oya.

264
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:56,523
But...

265
00:21:57,941 --> 00:22:01,611
I really...

266
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:10,495
I...

267
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:13,915
want to be your lover.

268
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:21,340
I have to make myself ready.

269
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:25,385
I love this person.

270
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:29,765
Yuri.

271
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:38,565
You should know
that I'm naturally very dominant.

272
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:46,490
I won't let go once I have something.

273
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:46,842
NEXT EPISODE PREVIEW

274
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:48,260
I'm looking for a high-paying job.

275
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:49,886
I just want to make money.

276
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:52,222
Sure. You look promising.

277
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:55,392
You've got a lot of courage,
making me jealous like this.

278
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:58,270
I promise to always love you.

279
00:23:58,603 --> 00:24:00,021
Until the day I die.

280
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:00,939
