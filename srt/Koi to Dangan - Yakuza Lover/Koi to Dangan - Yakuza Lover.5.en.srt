1
00:00:02,252 --> 00:00:04,004
I'm the underboss of the Oya syndicate.

2
00:00:04,087 --> 00:00:05,922
The name's Toshiomi Oya.

3
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:07,465
Yakuza?

4
00:00:07,549 --> 00:00:08,800
Yuri.

5
00:00:08,883 --> 00:00:11,344
This might be the last time we have sex.

6
00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:13,471
Let's feel wrong together.

7
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,015
Okay...

8
00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:17,475
The money these men
were willing to pay for Sakura?

9
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:18,643
I will pay instead.

10
00:00:18,727 --> 00:00:20,979
Sakura will never come back
to this nightlife world.

11
00:00:21,062 --> 00:00:24,107
Because she's the beloved lover of
the underboss of the Oya syndicate.

12
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,986
She's such a reckless girl.

13
00:00:28,236 --> 00:00:29,487
If you keep her near,

14
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:31,865
she might be the one
who'll put you in danger.

15
00:00:31,948 --> 00:00:33,950
Don't sell her short.

16
00:00:35,076 --> 00:00:36,327
I swear I'll be...

17
00:00:36,911 --> 00:00:38,079
the best woman for you.

18
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:40,957
You really like him a lot, don't you?

19
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,250
Yes.

20
00:00:43,126 --> 00:00:44,169
Tonight,

21
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:46,254
I'm in a hurry to meet my lover.

22
00:00:46,963 --> 00:00:49,632
I'm gonna make him mine for sure.

23
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:54,137
These five years
of working so hard will all be in vain.

24
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,055
AN ATTACK ON A GIRL.

25
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:55,972
Where are you going?

26
00:00:56,973 --> 00:00:57,891
Let's hang out.

27
00:00:57,974 --> 00:01:00,602
Oh, are we playing tag?

28
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:03,104
Feel more scared.

29
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:05,231
Feel more cornered.

30
00:01:07,942 --> 00:01:10,403
Wait. What?

31
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:12,030
It can't be...

32
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:24,501
I'm not gonna ask questions here
in front of everybody.

33
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:27,837
We can take our time and talk in private.

34
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:47,107
Would you wait in my room, Yuri?

35
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:49,400
Okay.

36
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:14,008
I hope Mr. Oya is all right.

37
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,428
I hope this matter doesn't become serious.

38
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:22,350
Mr. Oya.

39
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:24,853
Please come back soon.

40
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:37,115
Mr. Oya?

41
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:39,868
Are you...

42
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:43,663
going to kill me now?

43
00:02:50,044 --> 00:02:51,129
I'm sorry.

44
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:54,591
I loved you.

45
00:02:57,302 --> 00:03:00,305
Because I loved you,
I lost control of myself.

46
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:20,992
Choko.

47
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:23,953
Yes.

48
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:29,626
I'm not gonna do anything to you.

49
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,128
I'll keep protecting your bar as always.

50
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:35,048
-Mr. Oya.
-But...

51
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:39,302
You'll never see me again. Ever.

52
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:47,477
He must be joking.

53
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:50,939
Mr. Oya is in charge of this town.

54
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:53,858
How can he say I'll never see him again?

55
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:55,735
That's impossible!

56
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:00,406
Goodbye, Choko.

57
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:06,746
Wait, Mr. Oya.

58
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:09,916
Won't you at least...

59
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:14,087
have a drink with me one last time?

60
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:17,674
I beg you.

61
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:20,426
Please.

62
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:46,828
I won't see you again?

63
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,163
Yeah right!

64
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:52,917
Do you know how much effort I put

65
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:54,919
into making you mine?

66
00:04:57,338 --> 00:05:00,758

YAKUZA LOVER

74
00:05:47,221 --> 00:05:48,556
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

75
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:54,771
Thank you...

76
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:58,900
for accepting my final, selfish request.

77
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:11,996
It's a type of drug
that incapacitates the body, Mr. Oya.

78
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:14,290
It's supposed to be fast-acting.

79
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,626
Ah, so at any moment...

80
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:20,254
you will lose control of your body,

81
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:23,424
and the effects of the aphrodisiac
should kick in.

82
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:26,344
Hey,

83
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:29,180
what is it like to have sex with you?

84
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:32,809
What kind of tattoo
do you have on your back?

85
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:35,186
What does your moaning sound like?

86
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:39,732
You must be feeling that urge by now.

87
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:43,694
I can't wait. Hurry.

88
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:49,742
Thanks for the drink.

89
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:00,461
It's been a long time
since my drink has been spiked.

90
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:04,507
I enjoyed it.

91
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:12,014
This time, it really is goodbye.

92
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:13,975
Choko.

93
00:07:26,904 --> 00:07:28,448
Boss. Good evening.

94
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:33,453
-Oh, Boss!
-Don't make a fuss!

95
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:36,706
Just...

96
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:40,168
-Take me to Yuri right now.
-Yes.

97
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:03,399
-Ginji.
-Yes.

98
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,276
-Take him to his room.
-Right.

99
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:08,571
What happened?

100
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,908
It seems he was drugged
quite heavily by Choko.

101
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:14,911
Drugged? What kind of drug?

102
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:16,871
Don't worry.

103
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:19,373
It won't kill him.

104
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:26,506
Is there anything I can do?

105
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:31,344
Uh, well...

106
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:35,598
The drug that the Boss was given was...

107
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:42,980
Hurry, take me to Yuri...

108
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:45,608
I can't make it without Yuri...

109
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:50,613
Mr. Oya, it's me. Yuri.

110
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:52,448
I'm here--

111
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:55,159
-Does it hurt?
-Yuri.

112
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,832
Huh? Yuri.

113
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:04,669
Yuri...

114
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:07,129
Yuri...

115
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,256
Yuri.

116
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:32,822
Yuri.

117
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:48,045
It's okay.

118
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:50,506
Just leave everything to me.

119
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:52,550
Ah, Yuri.

120
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:10,234
Mr. Oya?

121
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:12,570
Are you all right?

122
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:31,255
Yuri.

123
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:38,054
Yuri.

124
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:40,806
I want you, Yuri.

125
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:47,396
It might get a little violent.

126
00:10:58,199 --> 00:10:59,241
Mr. Oya's teeth

127
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,702
as well as his fingers

128
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:04,538
are digging into me roughly.

129
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:10,920
But I don't mind him being rough,

130
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:13,381
because it's Mr. Oya.

131
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:20,471
I can take it again

132
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:22,556
and again.

133
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,915
How are you feeling?

134
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:51,544
I'm okay.

135
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:53,462
I'm glad.

136
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:12,273
I'm sorry.

137
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:17,570
Thank you, Yuri.

138
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:22,616
I'm glad I could be of help.

139
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:29,498
By the way...

140
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:33,753
I heard that you have a present for me
in return for the earrings I gave to you.

141
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,758
I just had to give you something
to express my gratitude.

142
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:42,386
I wanted to give you something that lasts.

143
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:45,306
Was it unnecessary of me?

144
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:49,018
-Thank you, Yuri.
-Huh?

145
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:52,354
I understand now.
You're that kind of woman.

146
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:56,734
I'll gratefully accept your present.

147
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,575
Here is my present.

148
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:17,254
The moment I saw them I thought,
"This is it!"

149
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:23,511
Can I put them on?

150
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:25,846
Yes.

151
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:33,229
Thank you.

152
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:36,398
I'll treasure them.

153
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:39,276
I'll wear them every day from now on.

154
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:42,863
I wear these every day too.

155
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,120
I'm so glad you liked them, Mr. Oya.

156
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:56,085
If I get to see you this happy,

157
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:58,796
then receiving presents isn't so bad.

158
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:09,473
They look good on you.

159
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:12,351
Those look good on you.

160
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:28,409
Hello, you guys.

161
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:31,912
Don't you get tired of
coming here every day?

162
00:14:32,496 --> 00:14:35,666
We're detectives. It's part of our job.

163
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:43,716
Get back.

164
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:45,259
Get out of the way.

165
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:05,905
Look.

166
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,784
He's with a girl. In broad daylight, huh?

167
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:13,621
Wow. She's beautiful.

168
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:15,664
Boy, do I envy him.

169
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,291
Me too.

170
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:38,395
Hey!

171
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:47,780
Yuri!

172
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:52,701
Huh? No way...

173
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:57,331
What the hell are you doing?

174
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,458
-Come with me!
-Wai...

175
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:00,542
Jin!

176
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:03,754
Jin...

177
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:14,181
-Pass.
-Here.

178
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:19,937
"He nails it! They win the tournament!"

179
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,939
"Their strength is overwhelming!"

180
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:24,525
"The team members run over with glee."

181
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:26,193
You smell like sweat.

182
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:28,445
What do you expect
from a high school student?

183
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:30,239
Hurry home and take a bath!

184
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:33,492
I'm too hungry now,
and it takes too long to get home.

185
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:35,661
Maybe I'll eat at your house
before going home.

186
00:16:35,744 --> 00:16:37,037
I want to see your mom.

187
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:38,872
Go home! Don't come over to my house!

188
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:41,250
Huh? You should be nicer
to your childhood friend.

189
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:43,460
You stink of sweat.

190
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:44,378
No way!

191
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:04,231
I won't beat around the bush.

192
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:08,610
You'd better not be his girlfriend!

193
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:12,698
I'm not.

194
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:15,367
Jin is in contact with my mom.

195
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:17,536
I can't let him know the truth.

196
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:19,538
The way you were together,
how can you not be?

197
00:17:20,664 --> 00:17:21,999
How can we be?

198
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,628
We're childhood friends.

199
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:29,757
And don't lie to a cop!

200
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:31,717
Stupid!

201
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:35,304
Don't you know what kind of guy he is?

202
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:37,598
Are you really his girlfriend?

203
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:41,477
N-No...

204
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:43,687
I'm not.

205
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:47,107
So please, don't say anything.

206
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:51,153
Come on!

207
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:53,447
Hey! Let me go!

208
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:55,616
-Just come on.
-Let go of me.

209
00:17:57,618 --> 00:18:00,370
If you're going down the wrong path,
I'll stop you.

210
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:03,665
I'm not gonna let you go back to him.

211
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:22,893
Why are we at your house?

212
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:24,394
Let me go.

213
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,368
Hey, Jin!

214
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:42,579
I'm not letting you out
until you break up with him.

215
00:18:43,997 --> 00:18:45,082
What are you saying?

216
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:49,211
Hey!

217
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:51,380
Jin!

218
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,634
Jin! Open the door.

219
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:57,427
Open it.

220
00:18:58,011 --> 00:18:59,763
Please, let me out.

221
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:02,683
Let me out, please.

222
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:04,935
Open the door.

223
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,148
Understood.

224
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:24,746
Hey.

225
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:27,249
Let me out, Jin.

226
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:29,793
I'm begging you.

227
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:37,718
Do you really know...

228
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:42,890
how the women of yakuza are treated?

229
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,644
It's dangerous, you know?

230
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:51,690
If I let you go...

231
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:53,942
you could die.

232
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:58,447
How can I just let you go? Idiot!

233
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:21,595
Yuri.

234
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:24,890
Why don't you be my girlfriend?

235
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:29,603
I'll cherish you.

236
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:32,272
I know I can.

237
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:37,069
You don't have to forget him.

238
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:39,196
-I will--
-I'm sorry.

239
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:43,158
You're absolutely right, Jin.

240
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:48,205
I think I'm stupid too.

241
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:52,709
If I were your girlfriend,
I would probably find happiness.

242
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:57,381
But it's not possible.

243
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:02,636
I'd rather spend
just a minute more with him

244
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:06,139
than being hit on by you.

245
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:14,856
Yuri, stop. You'll hurt yourself.

246
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:26,535
Yuri... Dammit!

247
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:45,887
What's that?

248
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:11,580
Whose lover do you think you kidnapped?

249
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,001
You dumb kid.

250
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:21,983
PREVIEW

251
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:23,402
We're romantic rivals.

252
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:24,986
We'll have to settle this.

253
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:27,406
I can smell that man on you.

254
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:29,825
Stay still while I override it.

255
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:31,701
Is there anything you want me to do?

256
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:34,913
I'm happy now.

257
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:37,165
I need you, Mr. Oya,

258
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:39,209
to feel happiness.

259
00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:42,045
You know you're supposed
to stay in your world.

260
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:44,131
Keep your hands off Yuri from now on.

261
00:23:44,214 --> 00:23:46,591
No one can come between us.

262
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:49,511
That's how much we are in love.

263
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:50,846
Do it.

264
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:53,348
If you want Yuri, then kill me.

265
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:55,225
You're all crazy.

266
00:23:55,976 --> 00:23:57,185
Every one of you.

267
00:23:58,103 --> 00:23:59,438
THIS DRAMA IS FICTIONAL.

268
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:00,939
