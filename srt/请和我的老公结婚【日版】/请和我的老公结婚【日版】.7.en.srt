1
00:00:15,516 --> 00:00:18,310
Cheers!

2
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:37,455
I'm so glad the Shine Muscat daifuku
went over well.

3
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:39,498
Thank you for your help, Yuto.

4
00:00:40,124 --> 00:00:40,958
Sure.

5
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:42,835
And with you as section chief,

6
00:00:42,918 --> 00:00:45,421
everyone can speak their mind,
so morale is way up.

7
00:00:45,504 --> 00:00:47,423
-I'm happy to hear that.
-And--

8
00:00:47,506 --> 00:00:49,008
More importantly...

9
00:00:49,091 --> 00:00:50,801
That's not what really matters.

10
00:00:50,885 --> 00:00:53,012
Ms. Kanbe, how are you holding up?

11
00:00:53,095 --> 00:00:53,929
Huh?

12
00:00:54,013 --> 00:00:56,348
What is it with that stupid bitch?

13
00:00:56,432 --> 00:00:59,477
She just waltzes in,
acting like some kind of pregnant virgin,

14
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,145
and then in front of everyone,

15
00:01:01,228 --> 00:01:05,357
announces that she's gonna steal
her best friend's boyfriend and marry him!

16
00:01:09,987 --> 00:01:12,156
I was beyond pissed!

17
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:14,492
I was this close to knocking her out!

18
00:01:14,575 --> 00:01:15,826
Calm down, Miku.

19
00:01:17,495 --> 00:01:21,165
But seriously... I can't believe
she'd do something so terrible.

20
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:24,710
You don't need to
put on a smile just for us.

21
00:01:24,794 --> 00:01:27,171
If you need to vent,
we're here to listen, okay?

22
00:01:27,505 --> 00:01:28,339
Yeah.

23
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,051
You invited me out
because you were worried?

24
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:35,054
Oh, thank you for your concern.

25
00:01:35,137 --> 00:01:36,639
-Oh, not at all.
-Not at all.

26
00:01:38,974 --> 00:01:40,184
I...

27
00:01:42,186 --> 00:01:43,479
feel...

28
00:01:43,562 --> 00:01:44,480
fantastic!

29
00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:45,439
-Huh?
-Huh?

30
00:01:45,523 --> 00:01:46,357
What?

31
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,858
I have no complaints at all.

32
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:51,529
I've never felt so relieved
in my entire life!

33
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:58,452
After all, I dumped my total scumbag
of a husband onto my horrible friend.

34
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:01,664
It doesn't get any better
than this, right?

35
00:02:03,874 --> 00:02:05,751
That's the spirit, Ms. Kanbe.

36
00:02:05,835 --> 00:02:06,669
-Yay!
-Yay!

37
00:02:06,752 --> 00:02:08,546
So true. No other way to put it.

38
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,423
Another beer, please!

39
00:02:11,882 --> 00:02:12,800
-Two?
-Me too, please!

40
00:02:12,883 --> 00:02:13,926
-Me too, please!
-Me too.

41
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:15,761
-Bring three beers!
-Okay.

42
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:19,014
This looks amazing!

43
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:20,599
Eat up!

44
00:02:21,392 --> 00:02:23,102
-We have tomatoes too.
-I want some!

45
00:02:23,185 --> 00:02:24,812
-With salt.
-Oh, salt!

46
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:26,146
Sorry for the wait.

47
00:02:27,231 --> 00:02:28,148
It's happy hour,

48
00:02:28,232 --> 00:02:30,025
so please drink as much as you'd like.

49
00:02:30,109 --> 00:02:31,694
-Thank you!
-Thank you!

50
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,487
Oh, you're new, right?

51
00:02:34,113 --> 00:02:36,198
My husband works you pretty hard,
doesn't he?

52
00:02:36,282 --> 00:02:39,285
Not at all. He treats me very well.

53
00:02:39,368 --> 00:02:41,370
Here's some of our special ramen,
on the house.

54
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:43,163
-Wow, thank you!
-Wow, thank you!

55
00:02:44,206 --> 00:02:46,125
Here, Ms. Kanbe.

56
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:48,836
-The meat is ready.
-Thanks!

57
00:02:49,587 --> 00:02:51,046
One more place! Let's go!

58
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:52,923
Ms. Kanbe, you've had enough to drink.

59
00:02:53,007 --> 00:02:54,758
It's raining, so let's call it a night.

60
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:56,677
Nah, it's just sprinkling. We're good!

61
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,470
Today, we get to drink all we want!

62
00:02:58,554 --> 00:03:00,264
Yeah! Let's go all the way!

63
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,393
I'm free!

64
00:03:05,644 --> 00:03:08,981
Meat, meat, meat. Meat!

65
00:03:09,064 --> 00:03:11,358
Come on, Reina, keep eating.

66
00:03:11,442 --> 00:03:14,320
Thank you, Mother,
but I've already had enough--

67
00:03:14,403 --> 00:03:15,779
What are you saying?

68
00:03:15,863 --> 00:03:18,908
You'll need some meat
on those bones to have healthy children.

69
00:03:18,991 --> 00:03:22,369
Fish, eggs, vegetables.

70
00:03:22,453 --> 00:03:23,495
I'm home.

71
00:03:23,579 --> 00:03:25,080
Tomo, welcome home.

72
00:03:25,164 --> 00:03:26,540
-Welcome home.
-Welcome home.

73
00:03:28,918 --> 00:03:32,254
Today, we're having
Matsuzaka beef sukiyaki!

74
00:03:32,338 --> 00:03:34,798
Sit, sit. Over here. Hurry, hurry!

75
00:03:35,257 --> 00:03:36,884
SALE
USA BEEF

76
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:39,678
Sit, sit. Hurry, hurry.

77
00:03:39,762 --> 00:03:42,264
I have something important
to tell you two.

78
00:03:43,265 --> 00:03:44,516
What do you have to tell us?

79
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,727
I had your fortune read
by a famous fortune teller.

80
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:50,522
He said if you don't have your wedding
within the year,

81
00:03:50,606 --> 00:03:53,233
your baby will become sick.

82
00:03:53,317 --> 00:03:54,360
Within the year?

83
00:03:54,443 --> 00:03:56,904
Isn't that really sudden?

84
00:03:56,987 --> 00:04:01,909
First of all, you two are doing
everything out of order.

85
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:07,122
You'd better hold the wedding as soon
as possible before you start showing.

86
00:04:07,206 --> 00:04:10,250
Otherwise, you'll embarrass yourselves
in front of the guests.

87
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:12,336
As for the venue...

88
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:17,049
It has to be
where your father and I got married.

89
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:19,635
Only Fugaen will do!

90
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:22,805
Look.

91
00:04:24,682 --> 00:04:25,516
See?

92
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:30,187
Excuse me, Mother,
nowadays, this kind of tacky...

93
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:38,696
I mean, traditional wedding venues
are no longer in fashion, you know?

94
00:04:40,531 --> 00:04:41,657
What do you mean?

95
00:04:42,533 --> 00:04:44,994
I'm thinking of having
a relaxing wedding ceremony

96
00:04:45,077 --> 00:04:47,997
while vacationing with Tomoya in Hawaii.

97
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:49,873
Wouldn't that be lovely?

98
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:53,752
A bright white sandy beach,
a beautiful church, and a sunset cruise.

99
00:04:56,088 --> 00:04:59,049
A vacation? Don't be ridiculous!

100
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:01,635
This isn't some kind of game.

101
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:05,556
A wedding is...

102
00:05:06,598 --> 00:05:10,978
an important occasion
to show all of our relatives

103
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:17,276
that you're a proper woman worthy
of marrying into the Hirano family.

104
00:05:18,152 --> 00:05:20,446
That kind of naive thinking
simply won't do!

105
00:05:31,123 --> 00:05:34,460
Wouldn't a Christmas Eve ceremony
be lovely?

106
00:05:34,543 --> 00:05:36,336
Right, Tomo?

107
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,214
Well, sure.

108
00:05:40,132 --> 00:05:46,221
Mother, it's a little late for Christmas
Eve reservations, don't you think?

109
00:05:46,305 --> 00:05:47,681
I've already booked it.

110
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:49,349
What?

111
00:05:49,433 --> 00:05:52,644
The person in charge of the venue
is one of my insurance clients.

112
00:05:52,728 --> 00:05:55,230
They just happened to have
a single cancellation.

113
00:05:55,314 --> 00:05:58,233
Wouldn't it be bad luck
to have a wedding ceremony

114
00:05:58,317 --> 00:05:59,985
in a time slot that had a cancellation?

115
00:06:00,069 --> 00:06:03,489
It's fine.
I had the fortune teller look into it.

116
00:06:03,572 --> 00:06:05,324
Apparently, this was meant to be.

117
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:08,035
So don't worry.

118
00:06:09,078 --> 00:06:11,205
The gifts, the food, and the dress,

119
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:14,333
I'll pick out the very best.
Just. For. You.

120
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:22,341
Sorry. I'm getting a call from work.

121
00:06:23,175 --> 00:06:25,886
-Oh?
-Hello. Oh, yes.

122
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:37,940
Right here, in my stomach...
I have a baby.

123
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:40,651
Tomoya and I are getting married.

124
00:06:49,493 --> 00:06:50,869
MISA KANBE

125
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:55,165
LUCKY LOAN

128
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:10,681
What the hell...

129
00:07:32,411 --> 00:07:34,371
I got carried away.

130
00:07:55,684 --> 00:07:57,936
WEDDING

131
00:08:14,536 --> 00:08:16,872
What should I do now?

132
00:08:24,046 --> 00:08:25,589
DIRECTOR SUZUKI

133
00:08:29,927 --> 00:08:30,761
<i>Sorry.</i>

134
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:32,804
My sister invited me,

135
00:08:32,888 --> 00:08:35,641
and I was going to drop by
once I wrapped things up at work.

136
00:08:36,225 --> 00:08:38,227
No, don't worry about it.

137
00:08:41,396 --> 00:08:43,273
Sounds like you had quite a bit to drink.

138
00:08:43,774 --> 00:08:45,234
Did you make it home okay?

139
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:47,986
Yes. I'm home now.

140
00:08:49,071 --> 00:08:50,322
<i>You're drunk, aren't you?</i>

141
00:08:50,781 --> 00:08:52,449
-I'm not drunk.
-You're drunk.

142
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:53,825
No, I'm not...

143
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:56,745
Yeah, I'm drunk.

144
00:09:00,082 --> 00:09:02,084
I'm very drunk.

145
00:09:03,752 --> 00:09:05,003
Did you have fun?

146
00:09:05,837 --> 00:09:08,173
Yes. I had the best time.

147
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:11,218
<i>I'm glad to hear that.</i>

148
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:17,599
If you were there,
it would've been even more fun.

149
00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:25,565
Did you say something?

150
00:09:27,651 --> 00:09:28,485
You are...

151
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:29,528
<i>Huh?</i>

152
00:09:32,281 --> 00:09:33,365
No...

153
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:46,461
Well, I guess I'll let you go.

154
00:09:58,473 --> 00:09:59,516
Um...

155
00:10:01,727 --> 00:10:03,103
tomorrow...

156
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:05,314
do you have some time?

157
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:08,525
<i>We could get some monaka and hojicha...</i>

158
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:12,279
Sure! I have... some time.

159
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:14,865
Then...

160
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:17,993
see you tomorrow.

161
00:10:19,036 --> 00:10:20,162
Good night.

162
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:23,290
Good night.

163
00:10:44,728 --> 00:10:49,274
Have Ms. Esaka or Mr. Hirano
contacted you since then?

164
00:10:50,484 --> 00:10:53,528
Tomoya's been calling me every day.
But I don't respond.

165
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:56,323
There's been no news from Reina.

166
00:10:58,033 --> 00:10:59,076
I see.

167
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:02,788
I just hope nothing else happens
from here on.

168
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:09,669
Well, never mind.

169
00:11:11,922 --> 00:11:15,217
I think Reina's lying about her pregnancy.

170
00:11:15,967 --> 00:11:17,719
You're probably right.

171
00:11:19,137 --> 00:11:20,847
What are you going to do now?

172
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:22,724
Now?

173
00:11:22,808 --> 00:11:25,727
Do you have anything
you want to do in life?

174
00:11:28,563 --> 00:11:29,481
Yes.

175
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:34,569
I have a whole list of things
I want to do, one by one.

176
00:12:02,013 --> 00:12:04,099
{\an8}LIKED BY MISA_0816
CHRISTMAS DECORATIONS ARE UP EARLY!

177
00:12:07,811 --> 00:12:08,937
Welcome.

178
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,021
Hello.

179
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:14,025
We truly appreciate your help
with the event the other day.

180
00:12:14,109 --> 00:12:15,652
Oh, no, it's my pleasure.

181
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:16,945
It's lovely.

182
00:12:17,571 --> 00:12:19,406
It's still a bit early though.

183
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:20,907
Can I go take a look for a bit?

184
00:12:20,991 --> 00:12:21,825
Go ahead.

185
00:12:38,842 --> 00:12:40,635
To tell you the truth, I'm really relieved

186
00:12:40,719 --> 00:12:43,054
that Ms. Kanbe and Hirano broke up.

187
00:12:44,723 --> 00:12:46,850
She didn't look happy with him.

188
00:12:53,607 --> 00:12:58,028
Do you still have feelings for Ms. Kanbe?

189
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:08,455
I really regretted not saying
anything to her

190
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:11,917
when she said she was getting married.

191
00:13:13,668 --> 00:13:15,086
Ever since high school...

192
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:19,674
I had plenty of chances
to tell her how I felt.

193
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:23,845
I was angry with myself for not doing it.

194
00:13:28,892 --> 00:13:30,519
What about you?

195
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:35,941
You have feelings for her, don't you?

196
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:41,655
I...

197
00:13:43,406 --> 00:13:45,450
have some things I need to take care of.

198
00:13:57,462 --> 00:13:58,672
-Hey--
-Well, then.

199
00:14:01,424 --> 00:14:02,384
What is it?

200
00:14:02,884 --> 00:14:04,052
Nothing. I mean...

201
00:14:05,971 --> 00:14:09,140
If you still have some time...

202
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:25,824
Excuse me! Sorry. I'm sorry.

203
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:29,119
Come on! What are you doing?

204
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:35,584
Sorry. Sorry. Please get out of the way!

205
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:37,002
Let me through!

206
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:39,629
Huh?

207
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:56,730
This brings back memories.

208
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,065
You used to come here too, right?

209
00:14:59,149 --> 00:15:02,986
Yes. It's my first time back
since I was a student.

210
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:04,738
Me too.

211
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:06,865
So, how many years has it been?

212
00:15:06,948 --> 00:15:08,283
At least...

213
00:15:08,366 --> 00:15:09,451
Twenty years.

214
00:15:09,743 --> 00:15:12,662
Yeah! Time really flies, doesn't it?

215
00:15:14,164 --> 00:15:15,874
-Wait...
-It's been ten years.

216
00:15:15,957 --> 00:15:17,250
About ten years.

217
00:15:17,334 --> 00:15:20,211
Right? You surprised me.

218
00:15:20,795 --> 00:15:22,464
Why don't we go to the library?

219
00:15:22,547 --> 00:15:23,381
Sure.

220
00:15:54,496 --> 00:15:57,832
<i>I never made any friends</i>
<i>all the way through college.</i>

221
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:00,418
<i>I was alone too.</i>

222
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:03,046
<i>You too?</i>

223
00:16:04,047 --> 00:16:05,965
<i>I'm not very good at socializing.</i>

224
00:16:07,926 --> 00:16:10,136
<i>Then you can't say anything about me.</i>

225
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:13,973
<i>In class and the cafeteria,</i>
<i>I was always by myself.</i>

226
00:16:14,891 --> 00:16:15,767
<i>Me too.</i>

227
00:16:18,937 --> 00:16:21,231
<i>What a lonely school life.</i>

228
00:16:21,773 --> 00:16:22,982
<i>It really was.</i>

229
00:16:30,198 --> 00:16:32,784
There was one meal
in the cafeteria that I really liked.

230
00:16:32,867 --> 00:16:34,953
It was the one thing I looked forward to.

231
00:16:35,036 --> 00:16:36,955
Do you happen to be talking about...

232
00:16:37,539 --> 00:16:39,374
-Mentai butter udon!
-Mentai butter udon!

233
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:42,585
<i>-Seriously?</i>
<i>-That's all I used to eat.</i>

234
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:44,462
<i>I also got that almost every time.</i>

235
00:16:52,303 --> 00:16:54,723
Thank you for coming here with me.

236
00:16:54,806 --> 00:16:57,142
Since I heard you went to school here too,

237
00:16:57,225 --> 00:16:59,144
I've wanted to come visit one more time.

238
00:16:59,227 --> 00:17:03,356
Likewise. This is the nicest
day off I've had in a while.

239
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:07,444
Thanks to you,

240
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:10,155
I got to check something
off of my list today.

241
00:17:10,739 --> 00:17:11,656
What was it?

242
00:17:12,407 --> 00:17:14,367
Reminisce about my days as a student.

243
00:17:14,451 --> 00:17:16,828
I don't think you're
old enough for that yet.

244
00:17:18,872 --> 00:17:19,914
You're right.

245
00:17:24,085 --> 00:17:26,004
I remember that tree.

246
00:17:26,087 --> 00:17:28,131
In winter, the fruit turned yellow.

247
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,633
That's a daidai tree.

248
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:34,888
Even after it bears fruit,
they don't fall for two or three years,

249
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:38,933
so it's considered a lucky tree
symbolizing continuity across generations.

250
00:17:39,893 --> 00:17:41,394
You really know your stuff.

251
00:17:42,103 --> 00:17:43,646
That's because...

252
00:17:45,482 --> 00:17:47,233
this is my lucky place.

253
00:17:51,321 --> 00:17:55,658
This is a lucky spot for me too.

254
00:17:56,951 --> 00:18:01,331
So, I actually did manage
to make just one friend here at school.

255
00:18:05,543 --> 00:18:07,629
<i>My father suddenly passed away,</i>

256
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:11,341
<i>so I went to his funeral in Toyama,</i>
<i>and when I came back to school...</i>

257
00:18:17,222 --> 00:18:18,264
No...

258
00:18:19,182 --> 00:18:20,016
Where are you?

259
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,976
<i>This pond had dried up...</i>

260
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:23,269
Kamekichi.

261
00:18:23,353 --> 00:18:25,814
<i>...and Kamekichi was nowhere to be found.</i>

262
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:32,987
<i>When I couldn't find him,</i>
<i>I lost all of my strength.</i>

263
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:40,662
<i>And I felt as if there wasn't</i>
<i>a single good thing left in this world.</i>

264
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:47,710
But... there was a god.

265
00:18:48,545 --> 00:18:51,631
A god who saved my precious friend.

266
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:02,892
DON'T WORRY
THE TURTLE IS SAFE WITH ME

267
00:19:04,686 --> 00:19:06,813
I don't know who that god was,

268
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:11,276
but what he did, saved my soul.

269
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:15,113
It made me believe that if I keep living,

270
00:19:16,114 --> 00:19:18,157
good things are bound to happen.

271
00:19:23,538 --> 00:19:24,581
What's wrong?

272
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:26,583
Nothing.

273
00:19:29,085 --> 00:19:33,923
Won't there be more good things...
from here on out?

274
00:19:35,133 --> 00:19:36,259
Yes, there will.

275
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:42,557
You should do the things you want to do.
One at a time.

276
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:47,270
I want to move.

277
00:19:48,229 --> 00:19:49,063
Move?

278
00:19:49,147 --> 00:19:51,316
Yes. I don't need a lot of space,

279
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:53,776
but I want a place
that just fills with sunlight.

280
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:56,195
What else?

281
00:19:56,279 --> 00:20:01,367
Well, I want to talk more with my friends
and to travel.

282
00:20:01,451 --> 00:20:03,077
Oh, and I want to get my license.

283
00:20:03,161 --> 00:20:05,788
I want to drive instead of
sitting in the passenger's seat.

284
00:20:07,123 --> 00:20:08,207
You can do all of that.

285
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,084
You think so?

286
00:20:10,168 --> 00:20:11,794
If you wish for it,

287
00:20:13,504 --> 00:20:15,048
even the rain gives way to the sun.

288
00:20:18,092 --> 00:20:19,510
It's strange.

289
00:20:20,511 --> 00:20:24,599
Whenever I talk with you, my head
fills up with the nicest dreams.

290
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:31,105
They'll come true. I'm sure of it.

291
00:20:39,489 --> 00:20:40,323
Huh?

292
00:20:51,668 --> 00:20:52,502
Let's go.

293
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:54,963
Huh? No way. Hey.
Director, please wait.

294
00:20:55,046 --> 00:20:57,006
You're too fast! Wait for me!

295
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:02,011
Wait, this is scary! I'm gonna fall!

296
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:18,611
Isn't it still too soon for baby clothes?

297
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:21,990
Well, they're all just so adorable!

298
00:21:22,073 --> 00:21:23,408
I just know it,

299
00:21:23,491 --> 00:21:26,327
it's going to be a little boy
who looks just like Tomo!

300
00:21:27,829 --> 00:21:30,665
It's almost time
for the wedding dress fitting.

301
00:21:30,748 --> 00:21:34,127
Oh, Mother, I really think I should
choose the dress myself.

302
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:36,879
No way! If I leave it to
a modern girl like you,

303
00:21:36,963 --> 00:21:40,425
you'll have your cleavage and legs exposed
in some shameless ensemble!

304
00:21:40,508 --> 00:21:43,845
I'll pick something decent.
Just. For. You.

305
00:21:49,767 --> 00:21:53,896
Mom, Mom, wait!

306
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,151
<i>Mom! Mom!</i>

307
00:22:04,699 --> 00:22:06,159
What are you doing?

308
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,245
Oh, no, it's starting to rain.

309
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,164
Come on, let's go.

310
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:14,208
The cold's not good for the baby!

311
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:17,587
Let's buy a belly warmer later, okay?

312
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:21,132
Your hands are so cold!

313
00:22:22,175 --> 00:22:23,468
It's chilly, huh?

314
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:44,322
Yeah... it's just not the same.

315
00:22:44,405 --> 00:22:45,656
I heard!

316
00:22:47,658 --> 00:22:49,202
You went on a date with my brother?

317
00:22:50,286 --> 00:22:53,581
No, I didn't! Did you hear that from him?

318
00:22:53,664 --> 00:22:54,999
No, from Yuto.

319
00:22:55,083 --> 00:22:57,210
He said you two
went to his cafe on your day off.

320
00:22:57,668 --> 00:22:59,212
Who went on a date?

321
00:22:59,962 --> 00:23:01,881
Ms. Kanbe and Director Suzuki.

322
00:23:01,964 --> 00:23:03,925
-Huh?
-No, it wasn't really a date.

323
00:23:04,008 --> 00:23:05,551
But you're a good match.

324
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:06,844
Huh?

325
00:23:06,928 --> 00:23:08,346
Right?

326
00:23:09,013 --> 00:23:09,847
It's fine.

327
00:23:09,931 --> 00:23:11,182
You're single now.

328
00:23:11,265 --> 00:23:13,434
-Go ahead and find your next love.
-Yeah!

329
00:23:14,685 --> 00:23:18,898
What do you honestly think
about Director Suzuki?

330
00:23:20,525 --> 00:23:22,902
Well, I...

331
00:23:22,985 --> 00:23:24,529
Did you get the invitation too?

332
00:23:25,321 --> 00:23:27,365
What? Reina's wedding?

333
00:23:27,448 --> 00:23:30,284
-There's no way I'm going.
-No way.

334
00:23:35,832 --> 00:23:38,000
I got an invitation too.

335
00:23:38,084 --> 00:23:39,001
Me too.

336
00:23:39,085 --> 00:23:41,129
Of course, I'm not going.

337
00:23:41,671 --> 00:23:43,464
Hey, do you have it with you?

338
00:23:43,548 --> 00:23:45,091
Huh? Oh, yes.

339
00:23:46,592 --> 00:23:48,886
I was planning on
just tossing it in the post box.

340
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:54,934
{\an8}REGRETFULLY DECLINE
MIKU SUZUKI

341
00:23:55,685 --> 00:23:56,602
It's the same.

342
00:23:57,478 --> 00:23:58,396
The same?

343
00:23:58,479 --> 00:23:59,564
It's nothing.

344
00:24:00,314 --> 00:24:02,525
I'm relieved things seem
to be going smoothly.

345
00:24:03,276 --> 00:24:04,569
Huh?!

346
00:24:04,652 --> 00:24:08,072
Come on,
just how nice of a person are you?

347
00:24:12,952 --> 00:24:15,079
{\an8}GROOM - BRIDE
TOMOYA - REINA

348
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,384
Hey.

349
00:24:30,678 --> 00:24:31,512
Hey!

350
00:24:31,929 --> 00:24:33,347
-What?
-What are we gonna do?

351
00:24:34,015 --> 00:24:36,350
The venue we have booked is huge.

352
00:24:36,434 --> 00:24:38,144
What if we can't fill the seats?

353
00:24:39,187 --> 00:24:40,563
Tell that to my mom.

354
00:24:40,646 --> 00:24:41,856
You tell her!

355
00:24:43,274 --> 00:24:45,818
What's with that attitude?

356
00:24:46,777 --> 00:24:48,321
You're making me do the invitations,

357
00:24:48,404 --> 00:24:50,656
the seating arrangements,
and everything else!

358
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:52,033
I don't have any preferences.

359
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:54,327
Seriously?

360
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:56,871
Stop being so fussy all the time.

361
00:24:57,246 --> 00:24:58,289
Excuse me?

362
00:24:59,582 --> 00:25:02,460
I don't want to have a wedding
at a tacky venue in a tacky dress,

363
00:25:02,543 --> 00:25:05,463
and with almost no guests!

364
00:25:05,546 --> 00:25:07,215
Then, why don't we call it off?

365
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:09,342
What?

366
00:25:13,721 --> 00:25:15,097
If you hate it all that much,

367
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,308
why don't we just call it off already?

368
00:25:17,767 --> 00:25:18,851
Call off...

369
00:25:19,769 --> 00:25:21,562
the wedding?

370
00:25:22,605 --> 00:25:23,773
Or the marriage?!

371
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:25,566
I dunno.

372
00:26:07,483 --> 00:26:08,567
You wanna come in?

373
00:26:19,787 --> 00:26:22,581
Thanks. It's warm.

374
00:26:22,665 --> 00:26:23,582
I'll make some tea.

375
00:26:24,208 --> 00:26:27,086
Wait, you can't have caffeine
since you're pregnant.

376
00:26:28,337 --> 00:26:29,171
Yeah.

377
00:26:30,506 --> 00:26:31,674
Is hot milk okay?

378
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:33,426
Thanks.

379
00:26:39,724 --> 00:26:41,100
What is it all of a sudden?

380
00:26:41,767 --> 00:26:44,395
I never thought I'd see you again.

381
00:26:47,398 --> 00:26:48,316
I'm...

382
00:26:49,358 --> 00:26:51,652
thinking about calling off the wedding.

383
00:26:52,486 --> 00:26:53,321
Huh?

384
00:26:53,404 --> 00:26:55,656
Wait. What's going on?

385
00:26:56,407 --> 00:26:58,200
Tomoya is being so cold to me.

386
00:26:58,743 --> 00:27:00,494
I didn't think he was that kind of person.

387
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:05,499
I don't think he likes me much anymore.

388
00:27:07,084 --> 00:27:09,337
He probably still has feelings for you.

389
00:27:09,837 --> 00:27:10,671
No...

390
00:27:11,005 --> 00:27:12,381
{\an8}TOMOYA HIRANO

391
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:17,636
-You can take the call.
-No! That was just an alarm.

392
00:27:18,262 --> 00:27:19,764
Well, you see, this is normal.

393
00:27:19,847 --> 00:27:23,559
Even super lovey-dovey couples fight
when they're preparing for a wedding.

394
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:25,853
Every couple goes through
it at some point,

395
00:27:25,936 --> 00:27:27,188
so maybe you're overthinking it?

396
00:27:27,271 --> 00:27:29,607
Maybe it's that...
marriage blues or something?

397
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:31,192
That could be part of it too!

398
00:27:32,943 --> 00:27:34,528
I knew it.

399
00:27:35,363 --> 00:27:36,530
You're just so nice.

400
00:27:38,532 --> 00:27:41,452
Even though I did
something so horrible to you.

401
00:27:43,287 --> 00:27:45,373
Well... just forget about me.

402
00:27:46,082 --> 00:27:48,542
Don't give up on being happy.

403
00:27:49,085 --> 00:27:50,002
It's just...

404
00:27:50,836 --> 00:27:53,297
I sent out the invitations,

405
00:27:54,298 --> 00:27:55,966
but nobody's coming...

406
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:57,343
I guess I should've known.

407
00:27:57,802 --> 00:28:00,096
I was a liar who fooled everyone
in high school.

408
00:28:01,138 --> 00:28:04,725
And at work, I was a traitor
who stole her best friend's fiancé.

409
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:11,232
Who would want to attend the wedding
of such a horrible woman?

410
00:28:12,566 --> 00:28:13,401
I guess...

411
00:28:14,819 --> 00:28:16,904
I should just call off
the marriage already.

412
00:28:16,987 --> 00:28:17,822
Wait!

413
00:28:17,905 --> 00:28:19,824
Reina, calm down.

414
00:28:20,741 --> 00:28:21,575
Huh?

415
00:28:22,868 --> 00:28:25,204
It's just... a lot's happened between us,

416
00:28:25,287 --> 00:28:27,123
but look, we've known
each other for so long,

417
00:28:27,206 --> 00:28:29,333
so I'll do what I can to help.

418
00:28:29,834 --> 00:28:33,546
I'll try contacting everyone at work
and Tanabe and Mita and the others again.

419
00:28:34,296 --> 00:28:35,714
-Are you sure?
-Yeah!

420
00:28:35,798 --> 00:28:38,551
I can't move on from this
if it ends on a bad note.

421
00:28:39,343 --> 00:28:41,095
I was upset at the time,

422
00:28:41,178 --> 00:28:44,557
but now I'm happy to wish
you and Tomoya all the best!

423
00:28:45,433 --> 00:28:46,350
Misa...

424
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:51,147
Misa, you really are Misa after all.

425
00:28:52,606 --> 00:28:54,275
I know I don't deserve it,

426
00:28:55,526 --> 00:28:57,111
but will you do me a favor?

427
00:28:57,903 --> 00:28:59,029
Yes, leave it to me!

428
00:28:59,113 --> 00:29:00,656
The wedding speech.

429
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:02,324
What?

430
00:29:06,662 --> 00:29:07,496
Sure.

431
00:29:28,434 --> 00:29:31,145
Looks like she's still worth using.

432
00:29:37,234 --> 00:29:39,153
If you say so, that's fine,

433
00:29:39,236 --> 00:29:41,989
but Ms. Kanbe, are you really
sure you want to go?

434
00:29:43,491 --> 00:29:45,701
Okay. See you at the office, then.

435
00:29:47,578 --> 00:29:52,291
Hey, why didn't you reserve
the movie tickets online?

436
00:29:52,374 --> 00:29:55,669
Sorry, sorry, I didn't realize
it was that popular of an anime.

437
00:29:55,753 --> 00:29:57,755
But I got us seats for the evening show.

438
00:29:57,838 --> 00:29:58,672
Okay.

439
00:30:11,602 --> 00:30:12,811
Mommy?

440
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:21,237
Let's go eat some parfaits.

441
00:30:23,405 --> 00:30:26,075
<i>What on earth are you thinking, Ms. Kanbe?</i>

442
00:30:26,158 --> 00:30:28,494
<i>Why are we going to that woman's wedding?</i>

443
00:30:28,577 --> 00:30:32,122
Yes, I know, but let me explain
the details tomorrow at the office. Okay?

444
00:30:32,206 --> 00:30:33,290
See you then.

445
00:30:37,962 --> 00:30:41,006
So far, I've secured
Ms. Sumiyoshi and Miku.

446
00:30:41,924 --> 00:30:43,551
Why do I have to...

447
00:30:47,346 --> 00:30:48,180
TOMOYA HIRANO

448
00:30:48,264 --> 00:30:51,058
THINK I WANNA CALL OFF THE MARRIAGE
CAN WE MEET JUST ONCE?

449
00:31:22,464 --> 00:31:23,757
We meet again at last.

450
00:31:23,841 --> 00:31:24,842
What's going on?

451
00:31:24,925 --> 00:31:25,843
Just like I wrote,

452
00:31:26,385 --> 00:31:29,096
I'll tell Reina and my mom...

453
00:31:29,763 --> 00:31:33,058
that I just can't get married
while lying to myself.

454
00:31:33,142 --> 00:31:34,893
Marriage is forever, after all.

455
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:40,482
You remember this place, right?

456
00:31:41,859 --> 00:31:44,820
Since the day I proposed,
my feelings haven't changed.

457
00:31:45,654 --> 00:31:47,323
I know I've hurt you a lot,

458
00:31:48,032 --> 00:31:51,118
but I always have and always will love y--

459
00:31:51,201 --> 00:31:52,077
Lame.

460
00:31:53,329 --> 00:31:54,163
What?

461
00:31:55,706 --> 00:31:57,958
What are you going to do about your kid?

462
00:31:58,876 --> 00:32:02,046
I'll... pay child support or whateve--

463
00:32:02,129 --> 00:32:05,507
You have zero savings and
you're 20 million yen in the hole, right?

464
00:32:06,383 --> 00:32:07,718
Who's going to pay?

465
00:32:07,801 --> 00:32:09,011
Me again?

466
00:32:09,094 --> 00:32:10,304
Or your mommy?

467
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:12,640
I'll...

468
00:32:15,142 --> 00:32:16,935
pay on my own or whatever...

469
00:32:17,019 --> 00:32:20,064
Have you ever done anything
on your own in your entire life?

470
00:32:20,898 --> 00:32:23,942
When you broke
your classmate's leg back in school,

471
00:32:24,026 --> 00:32:25,736
or when you stole someone's bike,

472
00:32:26,195 --> 00:32:28,572
your mom always cleaned up
after you, didn't she?

473
00:32:28,656 --> 00:32:29,907
How do you know about those--

474
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:31,784
I'm not your mom,

475
00:32:32,326 --> 00:32:35,079
and I've wasted enough of my life
cleaning up your messes.

476
00:32:38,415 --> 00:32:40,334
What's your relationship
with the director?

477
00:32:42,336 --> 00:32:43,545
I saw you.

478
00:32:44,505 --> 00:32:46,548
-You were...
-What business is it of yours?

479
00:32:46,632 --> 00:32:49,051
Who your ex is with or what she's doing.

480
00:32:49,134 --> 00:32:50,260
Misa, you...

481
00:32:50,344 --> 00:32:53,514
-you're the only one for me!
-Then I'll say this clearly.

482
00:32:57,101 --> 00:32:58,519
I am 200 million percent sure...

483
00:32:59,019 --> 00:33:00,771
that we will never get back together.

484
00:33:04,817 --> 00:33:06,652
For once in your life...

485
00:33:07,569 --> 00:33:10,239
how about you take responsibility
for what you've done?

486
00:33:19,623 --> 00:33:21,709
A restaurant delivery service?

487
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:24,628
To ensure reliable delivery,

488
00:33:24,712 --> 00:33:27,756
we would very much like
to partner with your company.

489
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,133
Is there any demand for it?

490
00:33:29,216 --> 00:33:31,802
Demand is set to grow exponentially.

491
00:33:31,885 --> 00:33:33,762
And with your help,

492
00:33:33,846 --> 00:33:36,098
we are confident that together we can

493
00:33:36,181 --> 00:33:38,475
pioneer this new market
and achieve success.

494
00:33:39,143 --> 00:33:41,311
Well, if you say so, I'll think about it.

495
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:42,980
Thank you.

496
00:34:02,708 --> 00:34:04,668
The wedding ceremony, huh?

497
00:34:07,796 --> 00:34:08,672
Did something happen?

498
00:34:08,756 --> 00:34:10,048
No, I'm okay.

499
00:34:28,609 --> 00:34:30,736
Wow, you look great!

500
00:34:30,819 --> 00:34:33,489
I thought you might show up in
a white wedding dress.

501
00:34:33,572 --> 00:34:35,157
I wouldn't do something like that.

502
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,034
Are you really okay?

503
00:34:37,117 --> 00:34:38,410
I'm fine.

504
00:34:39,411 --> 00:34:43,040
Oh, thank you all so much
for coming today.

505
00:34:43,123 --> 00:34:45,667
I bear no ill will,

506
00:34:45,751 --> 00:34:48,712
so please celebrate their new beginning
from the bottom of your hearts.

507
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:01,642
Thanks for the invite.

508
00:35:01,725 --> 00:35:03,602
This is the kind of energy...

509
00:35:04,311 --> 00:35:06,021
we need for Reina's wedding, right?

510
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:09,775
I told them those outfits
were a bad idea, but...

511
00:35:10,859 --> 00:35:12,569
Hey, Kanbe...

512
00:35:12,653 --> 00:35:14,863
I've been meaning to tell you this
for a long time now.

513
00:35:16,323 --> 00:35:17,741
I'm really sorry...

514
00:35:18,408 --> 00:35:20,118
for what we did to you back then.

515
00:35:20,202 --> 00:35:22,120
-I'm sorry.
-I'm sorry.

516
00:35:26,416 --> 00:35:29,503
Everything you went through...
it was all our fault.

517
00:35:31,713 --> 00:35:33,131
No worries, it's okay now.

518
00:35:33,882 --> 00:35:35,843
The fact that you came today is enough.

519
00:35:37,803 --> 00:35:40,389
Now then... let's go.

520
00:36:14,631 --> 00:36:16,008
Sorry to keep you waiting.

521
00:36:26,143 --> 00:36:27,227
Let's go.

522
00:36:28,979 --> 00:36:30,105
It'll be okay.

523
00:37:52,104 --> 00:37:54,731
Do you, Mr. Tomoya Hirano,

524
00:37:54,815 --> 00:37:58,026
vow to love this woman,

525
00:37:58,110 --> 00:38:00,153
to comfort and care for her,

526
00:38:00,237 --> 00:38:02,114
in sickness and in health

527
00:38:02,197 --> 00:38:05,450
-for as long as you live?
-Yes, I do.

528
00:38:05,951 --> 00:38:08,453
Do you, Ms. Reina Esaka,

529
00:38:08,537 --> 00:38:14,167
vow to love this man,
to comfort and care for him

530
00:38:14,251 --> 00:38:20,132
in sickness and in health,
for as long as you live?

531
00:38:21,258 --> 00:38:22,092
Yes.

532
00:38:22,634 --> 00:38:23,927
-I do.
-I do.

533
00:38:24,386 --> 00:38:25,679
Now, the exchange of rings.

534
00:38:31,268 --> 00:38:33,270
Please lift the veil.

535
00:38:43,822 --> 00:38:45,323
And now, the wedding kiss.

536
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:34,664
MISA

537
00:39:34,748 --> 00:39:36,917
REINA

538
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,212
Now, I would like to invite
Ms. Misa Kanbe,

539
00:39:40,629 --> 00:39:44,508
a close friend of the bride,
to say a few words of congratulations.

540
00:39:46,927 --> 00:39:48,678
Who invited her?

541
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:02,651
Hello, everyone.

542
00:40:03,652 --> 00:40:07,155
My relationship with Reina
goes back 20 years.

543
00:40:08,657 --> 00:40:12,077
When I lost my mother as a second grader,

544
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:16,164
Reina found me at the park
and held my hand for as long as I needed.

545
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:20,961
I still remember the warmth of her hand.

546
00:40:22,379 --> 00:40:24,840
We've been best friends ever since.

547
00:40:25,465 --> 00:40:28,385
Reina always stayed by my side.

548
00:40:28,468 --> 00:40:31,138
When I was sick, when I was healthy,

549
00:40:31,221 --> 00:40:33,473
when I was rich, and when I was poor.

550
00:40:33,557 --> 00:40:35,308
We were together so much

551
00:40:35,392 --> 00:40:38,228
I barely had the time
to make any other friends.

552
00:40:44,192 --> 00:40:47,279
I'm truly happy, as happy
as if it were happening to me,

553
00:40:47,362 --> 00:40:50,824
that my most precious friend in the world

554
00:40:50,907 --> 00:40:53,243
met a man as wonderful as Tomoya.

555
00:40:53,994 --> 00:40:55,620
You often hear people say that

556
00:40:55,704 --> 00:40:58,415
married couples start to resemble
each other over time,

557
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,876
but I think that's not quite right.

558
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:05,130
I believe we choose someone
who resembles us from the very beginning.

559
00:41:07,257 --> 00:41:08,800
And as proof of that,

560
00:41:10,302 --> 00:41:13,930
Reina and Tomoya are exactly alike.

561
00:41:18,143 --> 00:41:20,770
I think they're a match made in heaven!

562
00:41:23,315 --> 00:41:27,485
Tomoya, please be sure
to keep Reina happy.

563
00:41:28,528 --> 00:41:31,281
Reina, congratulations on your marriage.

564
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:35,660
And thank you very much.

565
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:01,603
Next, I would like to invite
Mr. Masafumi Yamashita,

566
00:42:01,686 --> 00:42:06,233
a close friend of the groom,
to say a few words of congratulations.

567
00:42:44,229 --> 00:42:47,649
Where do you think
you're going without a coat?

568
00:42:51,611 --> 00:42:52,779
It's cold.

569
00:42:52,862 --> 00:42:54,614
Let's go inside somewhere.

570
00:42:59,077 --> 00:43:01,955
We are fully booked. My apologies.

571
00:43:02,038 --> 00:43:04,916
My apologies, we are fully booked today.

572
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,669
Sorry, we are fully booked today.

573
00:43:08,837 --> 00:43:10,130
Thank you.

574
00:43:13,842 --> 00:43:15,010
They were fully booked.

575
00:43:15,385 --> 00:43:17,345
It is Christmas Eve after all.

576
00:43:18,763 --> 00:43:19,806
Let's go.

577
00:43:19,889 --> 00:43:20,974
Where?

578
00:43:21,057 --> 00:43:23,518
My house. It's close by.

579
00:43:24,978 --> 00:43:27,355
I can at least make you some hot hojicha.

580
00:43:35,905 --> 00:43:37,866
It's a bit of a mess, but please come in.

581
00:43:38,992 --> 00:43:40,327
Thank you.

582
00:43:43,038 --> 00:43:44,914
Oh, please sit wherever you like.

583
00:44:02,349 --> 00:44:04,392
Director, I see you have a pet turtle.

584
00:44:05,477 --> 00:44:06,311
That's...

585
00:44:12,776 --> 00:44:13,610
Huh?

586
00:44:14,235 --> 00:44:15,904
Kamekichi?

587
00:44:21,242 --> 00:44:22,619
There's no way.

588
00:44:24,746 --> 00:44:25,747
You're right.

589
00:44:29,793 --> 00:44:31,294
It's Kamekichi.

590
00:44:40,387 --> 00:44:41,554
You're the one...

591
00:44:43,807 --> 00:44:46,017
who saved him back then?

592
00:44:47,644 --> 00:44:49,938
Because he was your precious friend.

593
00:44:52,148 --> 00:44:53,066
Why...

594
00:44:54,234 --> 00:44:57,112
Why didn't you say anything
about something so important?

595
00:44:57,946 --> 00:44:59,197
Director...

596
00:45:00,782 --> 00:45:04,244
you're... my god?

597
00:45:27,058 --> 00:45:28,393
Oh, that's right.

598
00:45:31,938 --> 00:45:33,440
Would you mind opening the curtains?

599
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:37,694
Go ahead.

600
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:54,752
Did you do the decorations?

601
00:45:55,628 --> 00:46:00,341
Every year, the landlady
helps me put all this up.

602
00:46:07,182 --> 00:46:09,267
I can't help but laugh

603
00:46:09,350 --> 00:46:12,520
when I imagine you decorating the tree.

604
00:46:14,314 --> 00:46:15,440
That's all I could hope for.

605
00:46:16,357 --> 00:46:18,359
As long as you're laughing.

606
00:46:19,986 --> 00:46:21,613
Shall I make a Christmas cake?

607
00:46:22,030 --> 00:46:23,406
You can even bake cakes?

608
00:46:23,490 --> 00:46:25,200
Well, I've never baked one before.

609
00:46:57,065 --> 00:46:58,149
Aren't you...

610
00:46:59,651 --> 00:47:01,110
going to kiss me?

611
00:48:20,273 --> 00:48:22,817
<i>Reina, congratulations on your marriage.</i>

612
00:48:23,401 --> 00:48:26,863
And thank you very much.

613
00:48:33,828 --> 00:48:35,872
Please just help me out a bit.

614
00:48:35,955 --> 00:48:38,458
We're supposed to go
to my parents' this afternoon.

615
00:48:40,335 --> 00:48:42,587
Hey, why don't I call Misa?

616
00:48:43,171 --> 00:48:44,631
I'll get her to help.

617
00:48:46,382 --> 00:48:48,051
Cut it out already.

618
00:48:48,134 --> 00:48:51,679
Misa is the most useful
at times like these.

619
00:48:54,349 --> 00:48:58,770
<i>The number you have dialed is not in use.</i>

620
00:48:59,771 --> 00:49:03,316
<i>Please check the number and try again.</i>

621
00:49:04,442 --> 00:49:06,653
MISA KANBE HAS LEFT

622
00:49:10,531 --> 00:49:12,617
FOLLOWING
KANBE MISA

623
00:49:31,886 --> 00:49:32,845
Hello.

624
00:49:32,929 --> 00:49:33,763
Hello.

625
00:50:04,502 --> 00:50:07,338
{\an8}MIKU.SUZUKI
GOING SHOPPING FOR COUNTDOWN PARTY!

626
00:50:11,718 --> 00:50:13,219
How about sea bream carpaccio?

627
00:50:13,302 --> 00:50:14,512
What? Hell yeah!

628
00:50:14,595 --> 00:50:16,514
-Really? You like carpaccio?
-I love it!

629
00:50:16,597 --> 00:50:18,015
Then let's get a lemon.

630
00:50:18,558 --> 00:50:19,892
I'll get it.

631
00:50:21,144 --> 00:50:22,729
-Here.
-And a carrot.

632
00:50:22,812 --> 00:50:25,398
-I'll do my best to make carpaccio then.
-Yes, please.

633
00:50:25,481 --> 00:50:27,817
-Carpaccio. I'm hungry.
-Are you really?

634
00:50:32,864 --> 00:50:34,574
-Roast beef.
-Roast beef?

635
00:50:34,657 --> 00:50:36,868
-You're going to make it?
-Yes, I am.

636
00:50:36,951 --> 00:50:37,785
That's amazing.

637
00:50:37,869 --> 00:50:39,871
-Ms. Kanbe likes roast beef too.
-Oh, really?

638
00:50:39,954 --> 00:50:42,790
Good! Then we'll stuff ourselves
and drink our fill!

639
00:50:42,874 --> 00:50:44,083
-Let's drink!
-Yeah.

640
00:50:44,751 --> 00:50:48,171
I'm so happy
we get to eat your cooking here too.

641
00:50:48,254 --> 00:50:49,088
I'll do my best.

642
00:50:49,172 --> 00:50:50,965
Yes. I'm excited.

643
00:51:03,186 --> 00:51:05,521
-Sorry for the wait.
-Welcome back!

644
00:51:05,605 --> 00:51:08,399
-We bought a ton!
-Wasn't it cold out?

645
00:51:08,483 --> 00:51:10,860
-Miku, please make some hot tea.
-All right.

646
00:51:10,943 --> 00:51:12,862
Oh, that karaage looks delicious!

647
00:51:13,446 --> 00:51:15,573
Would you mind taste-testing it?

648
00:51:15,656 --> 00:51:16,741
Oh, can I?

649
00:51:30,379 --> 00:51:31,464
<i>Hey, are you really sure?</i>

650
00:51:31,547 --> 00:51:33,800
You do realize
he's using his position as the CEO's son

651
00:51:33,883 --> 00:51:37,512
to go after every woman in the office,
from new hires all the way up the chain?

652
00:51:37,595 --> 00:51:39,305
<i>That Noble Son has no shame!</i>

653
00:51:39,388 --> 00:51:41,307
<i>Seriously, that guy, he'll go for anyone.</i>

654
00:51:41,390 --> 00:51:44,852
<i>So just the thought of you getting</i>
<i>caught up with a creep like that...</i>

655
00:51:48,981 --> 00:51:50,858
Oh, you're so cute together.

656
00:51:50,942 --> 00:51:51,859
Oh, Reina!

657
00:51:51,943 --> 00:51:54,362
I'm leaving now. Sit there.

658
00:51:54,445 --> 00:51:55,279
Oh, why?

659
00:51:55,363 --> 00:51:58,157
They need me right now.
So, by all means, sit there.

660
00:51:58,658 --> 00:52:01,077
-Get in.
-Huh? I'm fine in the back.

661
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:02,203
It's fine, let's go!

662
00:52:05,122 --> 00:52:07,083
<i>Reina? What are you doing this weekend?</i>

663
00:52:07,875 --> 00:52:09,418
So, Tomoya, where do you want to go?

664
00:52:09,502 --> 00:52:11,379
I want to go see it with you!

665
00:52:11,462 --> 00:52:13,339
You're so vocal today.

666
00:52:13,422 --> 00:52:15,049
Like a new member of a theater troupe.

667
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:19,262
But Tomoya, your virtual currency thing
is going well, isn't it?

668
00:52:19,804 --> 00:52:22,765
As long as we're together,
I'll live anywhere.

669
00:52:24,725 --> 00:52:26,853
I'm sure you'll meet
someone wonderful eventually.

670
00:52:26,936 --> 00:52:29,355
I'm sure you'll find someone
you can trust too, Reina.

671
00:52:29,438 --> 00:52:32,108
Don't worry yourself so much over me.

672
00:52:32,191 --> 00:52:33,776
Find someone nice.

673
00:52:33,860 --> 00:52:35,778
<i>I'm actually meeting up</i>
<i>with Tomoya tonight.</i>

674
00:52:36,988 --> 00:52:38,573
Just tonight.

675
00:52:38,656 --> 00:52:40,324
Just once before you get married...

676
00:52:41,868 --> 00:52:43,119
let's do something bad.

677
00:52:44,287 --> 00:52:48,332
<i>He told me that what happened</i>
<i>with you was a mistake.</i>

678
00:52:49,250 --> 00:52:52,128
<i>I think I'm going to forgive him too.</i>

679
00:52:52,211 --> 00:52:54,964
I'll even forgive you too.

680
00:52:55,381 --> 00:53:00,261
Tomoya and I are getting married.

681
00:53:01,888 --> 00:53:04,098
Reina, congratulations on your marriage.

682
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:08,102
And thank you very much.

683
00:53:16,485 --> 00:53:17,862
For picking up the trash...

684
00:53:17,945 --> 00:53:19,947
For picking up the trash...

685
00:53:20,031 --> 00:53:21,032
...I threw away.

686
00:53:21,115 --> 00:53:22,366
...I threw away?

687
00:54:25,221 --> 00:54:26,764
Excuse me.

688
00:54:26,847 --> 00:54:29,016
Would you mind getting the tea leaves?

689
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:30,101
Oh, where?

690
00:54:30,184 --> 00:54:32,228
I think they're in the shelf
underneath Kamekichi.

691
00:54:32,311 --> 00:54:33,354
Okay.

692
00:54:33,437 --> 00:54:35,481
Kamekichi, I'm just going
to grab some tea.

693
00:54:37,191 --> 00:54:38,985
Which one, green tea or hojicha?

694
00:54:40,027 --> 00:54:41,696
-Anything's fine.
-Okay.
