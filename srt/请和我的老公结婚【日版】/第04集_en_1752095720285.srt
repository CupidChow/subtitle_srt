1
00:00:19,228 --> 00:00:20,646
What?

2
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:21,564
What's wrong?

3
00:00:25,401 --> 00:00:27,236
I don't need to give you a ride, do I?

4
00:00:28,404 --> 00:00:30,448
Why do I have to listen to you talking about me like this?

5
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:32,575
Do you think you understand me?

6
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:35,578
Your feet...

7
00:00:36,954 --> 00:00:39,165
It's really nothing serious.

8
00:00:42,293 --> 00:00:43,627
What are they doing?

9
00:00:44,253 --> 00:00:45,296
Are you having a fight?

10
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:46,714
It's really rare

11
00:01:00,853 --> 00:01:01,687
What?

12
00:01:09,111 --> 00:01:10,988
You son of a bitch

13
00:01:55,908 --> 00:01:56,867
Tomoya

14
00:01:56,951 --> 00:01:57,785
What's wrong?

15
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:00,287
Are we almost at Misa's apartment?

16
00:02:00,746 --> 00:02:01,664
I want to get off too.

17
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:03,123
What?

18
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:05,584
I have something to tell you

19
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:08,128
Um

20
00:02:09,255 --> 00:02:10,089
good

21
00:02:18,514 --> 00:02:21,058
(Sakura House)

22
00:02:24,353 --> 00:02:25,729
So tired

23
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,821
I always feel like I haven't been to your house for a long time.

24
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:35,030
Yeah?

25
00:02:35,614 --> 00:02:37,992
Because you hate me recently.

26
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:40,953
Don't say that.

27
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,833
Your room has become so clean and fresh

28
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:47,960
What about decorative panels for photos?

29
00:02:48,961 --> 00:02:50,880
I'm re-arranging so I put it away.

30
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:52,214
So that's it

31
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:56,093
What's up with this cactus?

32
00:02:56,719 --> 00:02:58,596
I saw it in a flower shop

33
00:02:59,889 --> 00:03:01,473
I thought it was cute so I bought it.

34
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:12,234
But I was really shocked

35
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:15,529
You and Minister Suzuki actually...

36
00:03:16,906 --> 00:03:17,907
Do you care?

37
00:03:19,909 --> 00:03:21,327
Of course I care.

38
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:26,040
I know you are passionate and unrestrained
But Youye and Mirai were also stunned

39
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:28,125
What were you and Minister Suzuki doing that day?

40
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,084
That day?

41
00:03:29,168 --> 00:03:30,753
On the way home from a class reunion

42
00:03:31,086 --> 00:03:33,964
I saw you and the minister walking together under the same umbrella

43
00:03:35,758 --> 00:03:36,592
That is…

44
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:37,509
What is that?

45
00:03:39,845 --> 00:03:43,098
I'm lost and can't find the station
I happened to meet the Minister.

46
00:03:43,182 --> 00:03:44,516
He just led the way for me.

47
00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:48,228
What a coincidence!

48
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:49,647
yes

49
00:03:57,863 --> 00:03:59,031
That's how she is

50
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:04,453
See I got something better than her
Lina absolutely can't stand it

51
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:07,539
I'm sorry, Minister.

52
00:04:07,623 --> 00:04:08,457
What?

53
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:09,375
nothing

54
00:04:10,626 --> 00:04:13,420
You mentioned the destiny.

55
00:04:13,504 --> 00:04:14,922
So you're talking about Minister Suzuki.

56
00:04:16,215 --> 00:04:17,591
Well... who knows?

57
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:23,430
If so, I'm worried about you.

58
00:04:26,225 --> 00:04:28,352
After all, isn't he famous?

59
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:30,020
What?

60
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:31,981
Don't you know?

61
00:04:32,064 --> 00:04:33,607
Uh no…

62
00:04:34,108 --> 00:04:37,194
I also know...

63
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,529
Can you accept it?

64
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,198
There are so many victims?

65
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,451
Are you really okay?

66
00:04:44,952 --> 00:04:47,037
He used his status as the general manager's son

67
00:04:47,121 --> 00:04:51,000
Keep chasing after women
No matter whether they are new or senior female employees, they are not spared

68
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:52,459
He's a lousy rich kid.

69
00:04:55,379 --> 00:04:58,590
Some girls became his fans without knowing it

70
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:01,510
To be honest, anyone can do it for him.

71
00:05:01,593 --> 00:05:03,721
Even if it's me, he'll come over and talk to me.

72
00:05:05,431 --> 00:05:09,184
All the female employees in the company don't want to pay attention to him

73
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:14,231
So I just think
In case you get scammed by that disgusting pervert...

74
00:05:14,565 --> 00:05:15,691
I know

75
00:05:16,525 --> 00:05:18,569
-What?
- I know it all

76
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:21,864
That guy came to me.
I only pretended to take the bait to tease him.

77
00:05:22,364 --> 00:05:23,615
Yeah?

78
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:25,284
Of course.

79
00:05:25,367 --> 00:05:28,704
How could I take such a disgusting man seriously?

80
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:30,998
It's Reina indeed.

81
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:32,207
Very good

82
00:05:34,418 --> 00:05:37,671

What's up?

90
00:06:13,082 --> 00:06:14,291
Redo this one.

91
00:06:15,626 --> 00:06:17,252
Where to redo?

92
00:06:18,253 --> 00:06:19,254
all

93
00:06:19,338 --> 00:06:20,380
A little more concise

94
00:06:20,923 --> 00:06:23,300
I have condensed it all.

95
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:24,218
What?

96
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:28,430

I submitted the information a month ago, right?

102
00:06:40,776 --> 00:06:42,111
You delayed for so long

103
00:06:42,194 --> 00:06:44,613
Asking me to do time-wasting work on the eve of an event

104
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:46,031
Is this considered harassment?

105
00:06:48,117 --> 00:06:49,034
never mind

106
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:50,953
Forget it?

107
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:52,037
That's great

108
00:06:54,665 --> 00:06:57,835
Really, young people nowadays
Just talk but no practice

109
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:01,296

observe?

I don't

189
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:42,489
What?

190
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:45,742
I didn't kiss Jiangzaka

191
00:13:47,077 --> 00:13:47,911
No but...

192
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:50,288
From your perspective, it might look like that.

193
00:13:50,372 --> 00:13:53,291
But we didn't kiss, 200 percent

194
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:55,377
Why do you have to defend yourself so seriously...

195
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,921
Excuse me? Why do I need to justify myself?

196
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:01,800
You are indeed right.

197
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:07,138
I just want to clear up the misunderstanding.

198
00:14:07,681 --> 00:14:10,350
I don't want you to have any misunderstandings about me.

199
00:14:15,689 --> 00:14:19,734
I told Jiang Ban that I'm not interested in her anymore

200
00:14:21,111 --> 00:14:23,613
Minister, you dumped Reina?

201
00:14:23,697 --> 00:14:28,952
Then she came so close and called me a bastard

202
00:14:33,915 --> 00:14:35,584
This isn't funny

203
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:37,210
Excuse me

204
00:14:37,836 --> 00:14:38,920
That's really...

205
00:14:41,256 --> 00:14:42,799
A disaster?

206
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:44,843
This is not funny…

207
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:57,981
It's enough that you can laugh

208
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,203

209
00:15:13,204 --> 00:15:14,164
yes

210
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:21,546
I hope we don't have to be like this again
The two met alone

211
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:29,846
I have something that needs to be dealt with.

214
00:15:46,154 --> 00:15:50,033
Lina broke up with her boyfriend
The quarrel lasted until Christmas Eve.

215
00:15:50,825 --> 00:15:51,910
Thank you for coming

216
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:54,579
Keep her from interrupting my wedding.

217
00:15:54,663 --> 00:15:56,289
Thanks

218
00:15:56,373 --> 00:15:57,791
But things are different now

219
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:00,710
Lina will never allow

220
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:03,713

Rina?

228
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:49,676
What are you going to do on the weekend?

229
00:16:50,552 --> 00:16:51,511
weekend?

230
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:52,971
Do you want to change your mood?

233
00:17:08,611 --> 00:17:10,113
Thank you for asking me out.

234
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:12,532
We haven't been like this for a long time.

235
00:17:12,615 --> 00:17:15,160
Yeah, I want to go out on a date with you.

236
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:16,828
So happy

237
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:17,871
Where are we going?

238
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:20,081
Shall we go to the observation deck of the Tokyo Skytree?

239
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:24,502
-Sorry for the wait.
-morning

240
00:17:24,586 --> 00:17:25,962
You are late

241
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,630
What? I'm on time.

242
00:17:28,423 --> 00:17:30,508
Did you also make an appointment with Youye?

243
00:17:30,592 --> 00:17:32,135
Well, it's rare anyway.

244
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:33,762
Right?

245
00:17:35,096 --> 00:17:37,223
Where do you want to go, Youya?

246
00:17:38,433 --> 00:17:40,226
How about going to the downtown area?

247
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:41,478
Okay, let's go.

248
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:42,520
Um

249
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:00,371

250
00:18:00,455 --> 00:18:02,540

00:18:20,892 --> 00:18:23,228
- I'm definitely going to see it.
-Um

258
00:18:23,311 --> 00:18:25,522
But it's hard to get tickets.

259
00:18:26,147 --> 00:18:28,358
- I hope I can get it
-Um

260
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:30,693
I want to go see it with you too.

261

Youya, this is so cute

262
00:18:38,493 --> 00:18:40,745
Let's buy the same one.

263
00:18:40,829 --> 00:18:42,163
What?

264
00:18:42,247 --> 00:18:43,623
Where should I hang this?

265
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:46,209
Okay, I want it

266
00:18:46,876 --> 00:18:49,045
Lina, you should buy one too.

267
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:51,339
It's okay. I don't need it anymore.

268
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:53,091
Yeah?

269
00:18:54,384 --> 00:18:56,135
I want to use it as a car key chain

00:18:56,219 --> 00:18:57,595
Not bad

271
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,222
I can't do anything about you.

272
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:00,682

-Um

-How about it?
-It's delicious.

291
00:19:45,226 --> 00:19:47,645
What does "just" mean?

292
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:50,773
Then I started

293
00:19:50,857 --> 00:19:52,775
I'll eat fried chicken first

294
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:53,985
I wonder if it tastes good?

295
00:19:56,988 --> 00:19:58,239

I'm so happy

306
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:21,763
Because I've been busy with work recently.

307
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:24,515
I haven't had a holiday like this in a long time.

308
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:26,768

309
00:20:26,851 --> 00:20:28,478
-Um
-Is this okay?

310
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:29,562

We are happier with you.

00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,569
I always feel so embarrassed

314
00:20:36,653 --> 00:20:38,696
Do I make you feel uncomfortable?

315
00:20:40,657 --> 00:20:41,866
Not at all

316
00:20:42,492 --> 00:20:44,661
Really? Then eat it quickly.

00:21:20,196 --> 00:21:24,492
It's going well
But the budget was a bit too high.

324
00:21:25,326 --> 00:21:28,871
I think the project itself
There is still room for re-examination

325
00:21:29,872 --> 00:21:32,667
This is a project personally promoted by the president.

326
00:21:33,126 --> 00:21:38,715
Just happened to meet the successful bid for the Tokyo Olympics
This will bring our company back to life.

327

328
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:45,596

How is the future going lately?

330
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:54,063
She always stays at your house
I didn't even have a chance to talk to her.

331
00:21:54,772 --> 00:21:57,775
It's still a long way from being the general manager.

do you like me?

337
00:22:43,654 --> 00:22:46,657
Really, what are you talking about in a place like this?

338
00:22:47,909 --> 00:22:49,410
You are shy

341
00:23:00,713 --> 00:23:04,550
Yeah, but it's expensive.

342
00:23:05,009 --> 00:23:06,344
But you also

343
00:23:06,427 --> 00:23:09,514
Aren’t your cryptocurrency investments performing well?

344
00:23:10,515 --> 00:23:11,349

So cool

351
00:23:30,827 --> 00:23:34,122
It makes people feel like fools when working hard.

352
00:23:34,205 --> 00:23:37,416

354
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:43,631
As long as I can be with you, it doesn't matter where I live

355
00:23:44,132 --> 00:23:45,341
What?

356
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:46,968

-Feel sorry

but…

360
00:24:13,995 --> 00:24:15,496
She is very irritable

361
00:24:16,831 --> 00:24:19,000
She was very upset.

362
00:24:19,834 --> 00:24:21,460
Good

363
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:28,384

start

370
00:26:35,803 --> 00:26:37,179
I started

371
00:26:40,391 --> 00:26:44,103
Youya, you like curry too much, don’t you?

372
00:26:44,186 --> 00:26:46,105
- You always eat curry
-real

373
00:26:46,188 --> 00:26:47,732
-but…
-Um

374
00:26:47,815 --> 00:26:49,233
You guys have such a good relationship.

375
00:26:50,526 --> 00:26:52,611
-It's delicious.
- Mmm, it's delicious

376
00:26:58,576 --> 00:27:01,370
Dad is worried about you.

377
00:27:02,163 --> 00:27:03,039
Yeah?

378
00:27:03,372 --> 00:27:07,084
Don't come to me every time for free food and drinks
Go back and have dinner with him sometimes.

379
00:27:08,002 --> 00:27:10,087
I'm worried about my brother.

380
00:27:10,755 --> 00:27:13,424
I've already said that what happened between me and Jiang Ban was a misunderstanding.

381
00:27:13,507 --> 00:27:16,302
I'm not talking about that, I'm talking about Kobe

382
00:27:17,094 --> 00:27:19,138
She's been so weird lately.

383
00:27:19,221 --> 00:27:23,392
Workplace romance known to others
There's obviously no benefit.

384
00:27:23,476 --> 00:27:26,604
She openly flirted with that worthless man

385
00:27:26,687 --> 00:27:30,274
And with that terrible woman
Keep playing good friends

386
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,863
Are you going to sit back and do nothing?

387
00:27:36,447 --> 00:27:37,907
Don't talk too much

388
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:38,824
after all…

389
00:27:38,908 --> 00:27:42,495
I was able to meet someone I admired during my school days at the company.

390
00:27:42,578 --> 00:27:44,830
This is simply a miracle.

391
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:51,087
You were pushed so hard by your grandfather.
But I would never go on a blind date

392
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:54,131
It has something to do with Kobe, right?

393
00:27:54,215 --> 00:27:55,299
That's not the case

394
00:27:59,261 --> 00:28:00,596
Did you know?

395
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:05,768
If we waste this miracle,
You're a hopeless idiot.

396
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,771
I know

397
00:28:09,355 --> 00:28:10,189
What?

398
00:28:11,273 --> 00:28:12,108
so…

399
00:28:15,986 --> 00:28:17,696
I'm not going to sit back and do nothing.

400
00:28:18,781 --> 00:28:20,324
So that's it

401
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:33,170
Wow, I'm so cool

402
00:28:37,758 --> 00:28:39,468
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

403
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:41,095
Sorry for asking you out so suddenly

404
00:28:41,178 --> 00:28:42,471
It doesn't matter at all

405
00:28:42,555 --> 00:28:44,557
Anyway, Misa has to work overtime today.

406
00:28:45,057 --> 00:28:46,308
I want a whiskey and soda

407
00:28:46,392 --> 00:28:47,226
OK

408
00:28:48,644 --> 00:28:50,479
Are you guys in love recently?

409
00:28:51,397 --> 00:28:52,731
It's OK

410
00:28:53,482 --> 00:28:54,775
Lina, you said last time

411
00:28:54,859 --> 00:28:58,195
Some girls start to feel lost before getting married.

412
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,782
I think Misa is just the opposite.

413
00:29:02,408 --> 00:29:05,411
She seems to have completely locked onto me.

414
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:07,746
Right

415
00:29:09,331 --> 00:29:13,752
Being popular is a sin

416
00:29:15,838 --> 00:29:18,632
Maybe Misa also wants to atone for her sins?

417
00:29:19,842 --> 00:29:20,676
What?

418
00:29:21,218 --> 00:29:23,721
Misa has started playing with the photo wall recently, right?

419
00:29:24,597 --> 00:29:28,767
But Misa is not very good at social media

420
00:29:28,851 --> 00:29:31,562
And she's also tracking Yuto.

421
00:29:31,645 --> 00:29:32,480
What?

422
00:29:32,563 --> 00:29:33,397
(Yuto Tanabe)

423
00:29:33,481 --> 00:29:35,191
(Kobe Misa: Thank you for your hospitality!)

424
00:29:38,819 --> 00:29:40,446
Don't you know?

425
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:44,158
Didn't she track you?

426
00:29:45,451 --> 00:29:47,161
How is that possible?

427
00:29:48,537 --> 00:29:53,250
But I also use social media for work these days.

428
00:29:56,086 --> 00:29:58,839
Back to the point

429
00:29:58,923 --> 00:30:01,884
Misa said that Minister Suzuki also flirted with her

430
00:30:05,596 --> 00:30:07,515
Didn't she consult you?

431
00:30:10,184 --> 00:30:11,769
Well...

432
00:30:12,144 --> 00:30:15,814
Maybe she kept it a secret because she didn't want you to worry.

433
00:30:16,315 --> 00:30:17,149
Sorry for the long wait

434
00:30:27,576 --> 00:30:32,248
As the saying goes, like mother, like daughter
Even if people don't want to be like their parents

435
00:30:32,331 --> 00:30:35,084
But some things are inevitable

436
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:38,712
What's the meaning?

437
00:30:42,049 --> 00:30:43,342
Haven't you heard?

438
00:30:51,267 --> 00:30:54,728
The Olympics will obviously be postponed
No spectators are allowed to enter...

439
00:30:55,271 --> 00:30:56,105
What did you say?

440
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:57,565
fine

441
00:30:59,567 --> 00:31:04,029
This project for foreign tourists
Is it possible to terminate?

442
00:31:04,113 --> 00:31:05,447
What? Impossible

443
00:31:05,531 --> 00:31:07,950
This is a large-scale project that has mobilized all of our company

444
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:09,368
That's true.

445
00:31:09,451 --> 00:31:11,537
Sorry, I have to pick up my daughter from cram school.

446
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:13,497
I'm ready to go back too. Bye.

447
00:31:13,581 --> 00:31:14,582
goodbye

448
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:19,295
alright

449
00:31:26,802 --> 00:31:27,636
Hello?

450
00:31:29,179 --> 00:31:32,683
What? Arrange a date to meet the parents?

451
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:34,810
Does it have to be today?

452
00:31:37,062 --> 00:31:39,607
Sorry, I'll call you back later.

453
00:31:44,987 --> 00:31:46,363
I'm leaving first

454
00:31:46,447 --> 00:31:48,198
what's on your mind?

455
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:55,372
Are you going to make the same mistake again?

456
00:31:57,082 --> 00:31:58,292
This has nothing to do with the Minister.

457
00:32:09,595 --> 00:32:11,388
I will lend you a helping hand

458
00:32:32,201 --> 00:32:35,245
You obviously don't know anything

459
00:32:35,329 --> 00:32:37,998
Please don't act like you know everything.

460
00:32:40,042 --> 00:32:42,753
If I ask someone else, it will be the same as before.

461
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:46,048
I don't need help from anyone else

462
00:33:14,785 --> 00:33:15,786
Thank you for your hard work

463
00:33:22,835 --> 00:33:23,919
Have you been drinking?

464
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:26,213
Yeah, I drank a little.

465
00:33:28,132 --> 00:33:30,384
You said you wanted to arrange a date to meet the parents

466
00:33:30,467 --> 00:33:33,721
Before the Olympic tasting event ended
I don't know the work schedule yet

467
00:33:33,804 --> 00:33:35,723
Could you wait for me a moment?

468
00:33:36,223 --> 00:33:37,391
OK

469
00:33:38,058 --> 00:33:40,310
I respect your work

470
00:33:42,604 --> 00:33:45,733
Just take me here, thank you.

471
00:33:45,816 --> 00:33:47,359
Why did you change the locks?

472
00:33:47,443 --> 00:33:48,318
What?

473
00:33:48,402 --> 00:33:50,612
Here are the new keys and the remittance slip

474
00:33:50,696 --> 00:33:51,864
Thanks

475
00:33:51,947 --> 00:33:53,240
Then I'm sorry.

476
00:33:53,657 --> 00:33:55,951
I was planning to wait for you at your house.

477
00:33:57,327 --> 00:33:59,204
But the backup key can't open

478
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:02,875
Really funny

479
00:34:04,626 --> 00:34:06,378
My keys are missing.

480
00:34:06,462 --> 00:34:08,338
That's why I asked them to change the locks for me.

481
00:34:09,089 --> 00:34:10,257
So that's it

482
00:34:12,134 --> 00:34:13,927
Why did you hold hands?

483
00:34:15,971 --> 00:34:16,805
What?

484
00:34:18,724 --> 00:34:21,643
I'll go to Planning Department 2 to pick you up after get off work.

485
00:34:22,394 --> 00:34:24,688
You held hands with Minister Suzuki, right?

486
00:34:27,566 --> 00:34:28,567
What's going on?

487
00:34:29,651 --> 00:34:30,486
No…

488
00:34:32,112 --> 00:34:33,322
never mind

489
00:34:33,906 --> 00:34:35,908
Let's go to your house and talk slowly.

490
00:34:40,621 --> 00:34:42,122
Why are you so wary?

491
00:34:42,581 --> 00:34:44,374
I'm your fiancé, right?

492
00:34:45,125 --> 00:34:46,084
We need to get along well.

493
00:34:46,168 --> 00:34:48,003
A date in downtown is super fun, right?

494
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:49,379
You should go home today.

495
00:34:49,463 --> 00:34:50,506
here we go again

496
00:34:51,298 --> 00:34:53,509
Is there anything wrong with me going to your house?

497
00:34:54,134 --> 00:34:57,805
Is there anyone else in your family?

498
00:34:58,305 --> 00:34:59,848
Your first love Yuto?

499
00:34:59,932 --> 00:35:02,017
-What?
-Misa, you are amazing

500
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,436
Using overtime as an excuse to meet other men

501
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,230
There are other men when I get home

502
00:35:06,313 --> 00:35:07,189
I didn’t…

503
00:35:07,272 --> 00:35:09,525
It is true that like mother, like daughter.

504
00:35:11,777 --> 00:35:12,611
What's the meaning?

505
00:35:12,694 --> 00:35:17,491
Your mother...
You abandoned your family and ran away with this man, right?

506
00:35:22,246 --> 00:35:23,914
Lina told you that.

507
00:35:24,331 --> 00:35:25,374
That's not important.

508
00:35:26,834 --> 00:35:29,002
It doesn't matter. Good night.

509
00:35:31,672 --> 00:35:33,882
You'd better take advantage of the time when I still ask you in a nice tone

510
00:35:33,966 --> 00:35:35,175
Explain it to me

511
00:35:35,801 --> 00:35:37,928
Why do you say you want to work overtime?
But meeting other men?

512
00:35:38,011 --> 00:35:39,721
Why did you change the locks without my knowledge?

513
00:35:39,805 --> 00:35:41,890
Because I don't want you to break into my house anymore.

514
00:35:58,574 --> 00:35:59,616
Misa I...

515
00:36:01,743 --> 00:36:02,828
Are you satisfied?

516
00:37:45,639 --> 00:37:47,766
Isn't there a cafe in front of the station?

517
00:37:48,767 --> 00:37:51,937
There is a shop assistant who is very handsome.

518
00:37:52,896 --> 00:37:55,357
Then you know Takahashi, right?

519
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,442
I heard she wanted to pursue that clerk

520
00:37:57,526 --> 00:37:58,610
Isn’t it exaggerated?

521
00:38:03,031 --> 00:38:04,116
Beautiful yarn?

522
00:38:05,909 --> 00:38:07,077
Beautiful yarn?

523
00:38:07,786 --> 00:38:09,037
Are you listening to me?

524
00:38:09,121 --> 00:38:11,456
Why are you daydreaming?

525
00:38:14,418 --> 00:38:16,086
Did anything happen between you and your friend?

526
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,466
In fact, he came to discuss it with me.

527
00:38:22,467 --> 00:38:25,554
He doubts your relationship with Yuto.

528
00:38:26,972 --> 00:38:29,975
Is it okay to marry such a jealous man?

529
00:38:31,101 --> 00:38:35,272
If you have any hesitation in your heart
It's better to reconsider it.

530
00:38:36,189 --> 00:38:40,068
In this era, marriage does not mean everything
And I'm with you

531
00:38:45,282 --> 00:38:49,411
Misa, you must be happy

532
00:38:58,211 --> 00:38:59,463
Kobe…

533
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:10,974
that…

534
00:39:12,184 --> 00:39:13,977
I'm really sorry for yesterday.

535
00:39:15,937 --> 00:39:17,981
I'm a little drunk

536
00:39:18,482 --> 00:39:20,942
But this can't be used as an excuse

537
00:39:22,235 --> 00:39:23,695
I'm really, really sorry

538
00:39:28,283 --> 00:39:29,117
Then…

539
00:39:31,787 --> 00:39:32,746
Look at this

540
00:39:32,829 --> 00:39:33,830
(Three bedrooms and one living room)

541
00:39:33,914 --> 00:39:36,792
I have already booked it temporarily
Our future new home is a newly built house

542
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:39,127
New house

543
00:39:39,669 --> 00:39:41,338
And it's a side house

544
00:39:42,297 --> 00:39:44,466
Although a bit over budget

545
00:39:44,549 --> 00:39:48,011
But there are my investment income and your savings

546
00:39:48,095 --> 00:39:51,389
If I ask my mother for a favor again
She will definitely help us.

547
00:39:52,015 --> 00:39:55,519
Oh, my mom gave me some alternate dates for the meeting.

548
00:39:56,144 --> 00:39:59,856
We still have to make a reservation at the restaurant
So I hope I can decide today.

549
00:40:00,315 --> 00:40:03,401
My mom is free on Saturdays and Sundays...

550
00:40:03,485 --> 00:40:05,529
Do you think I will forgive you?

551
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:08,240
What?

552
00:40:10,617 --> 00:40:12,661
No matter how extreme you have done

553
00:40:13,537 --> 00:40:16,665
You think that as long as you appease
Others will forgive you easily

554
00:40:17,374 --> 00:40:18,500
What did you say?

555
00:40:19,501 --> 00:40:21,253
How long are you going to hold a grudge?

556
00:40:22,587 --> 00:40:24,005
Isn’t it too annoying?

557
00:40:24,381 --> 00:40:26,758
I've already bowed my head and apologized to you.

558
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:30,095
I also booked the new house you wanted

559
00:40:31,888 --> 00:40:34,766
Look at me lowering my posture
Are you starting to put on airs?

560
00:40:34,850 --> 00:40:36,434
After all, this is all because of you.

561
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:38,145
I?

562
00:40:38,228 --> 00:40:39,980
You are the one who makes me angry

563
00:40:40,063 --> 00:40:42,691
Don't try to shirk responsibility and pretend to be a victim.

564
00:40:51,366 --> 00:40:55,245
Why the second time?
Am I still with this kind of person?

565
00:40:55,787 --> 00:40:56,663
What did you say?

566
00:40:59,749 --> 00:41:01,459
I won't meet my parents.

567
00:41:01,877 --> 00:41:03,712
I don't want to meet your parents.

568
00:41:04,379 --> 00:41:06,381
I don't want to stay with you for even one more second

569
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:08,300
I don't want to marry you

570
00:41:11,052 --> 00:41:12,220
Let's break up

571
00:41:18,685 --> 00:41:19,853
What about the apartment?

572
00:41:22,355 --> 00:41:24,900
Can I just terminate the contract? Goodbye

573
00:41:50,050 --> 00:41:50,884
Sorry for bothering you

574
00:41:55,972 --> 00:41:59,976
I have tentatively booked an apartment in Honmachi 4-chome…

575
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:04,981
I see. Please come to our store.

576
00:42:05,899 --> 00:42:08,860
Would you like to meet at the door of your apartment?

577
00:42:09,402 --> 00:42:11,947
Ok, thank you for your help.

578
00:42:15,283 --> 00:42:18,453
The apartment in Honmachi 4-chome was cancelled

579
00:42:19,371 --> 00:42:22,249
If it's cancelled, why do we have to meet there?

580
00:42:24,459 --> 00:42:25,293
Yes

581
00:42:32,926 --> 00:42:33,969
what are you doing here?

582
00:42:34,970 --> 00:42:37,639
Didn't you ask me not to talk to you in the company?

583
00:42:38,139 --> 00:42:39,140
Also correct

584
00:42:39,224 --> 00:42:41,101
I'm waiting for Kobe to meet me.

585
00:42:41,184 --> 00:42:42,435
As her colleague

586
00:42:42,852 --> 00:42:46,564
I think she's a little weird today.
I was a little worried so I asked her out for a drink.

587
00:42:46,648 --> 00:42:48,608
But she seems to be arriving later

588
00:42:48,692 --> 00:42:50,944
She said she would come after completing the apartment contract termination procedures

589
00:42:51,403 --> 00:42:52,237
apartment?

590
00:42:52,654 --> 00:42:53,780
Apartments in Honmachi

591
00:42:56,074 --> 00:42:58,326
Hirano signed the contract on his own initiative

592
00:42:59,786 --> 00:43:00,704
What's wrong?

593
00:43:07,627 --> 00:43:10,672
-Thanks
-Thank you, please go slowly

594
00:43:25,979 --> 00:43:27,230
(Elevator under maintenance)

595
00:43:27,314 --> 00:43:29,316
(Escape ladder)

596
00:43:56,426 --> 00:43:59,637
It's all because I married you
My life has become so bad.

597
00:43:59,721 --> 00:44:02,349
My life is a failure because of you

598
00:44:02,432 --> 00:44:04,684
You just made a mistake
Do you think I'm a bad person?

599
00:44:04,768 --> 00:44:07,062
I have disliked you since I was a child

600
00:44:07,145 --> 00:44:08,563
We have never been friends

601
00:44:16,613 --> 00:44:19,449
Bring it here!

602
00:44:21,368 --> 00:44:23,661
Have you had enough of this? Damn it.

603
00:44:34,214 --> 00:44:36,591
What is going to happen will happen

604
00:44:42,347 --> 00:44:43,765
Have you had enough of this? Damn it.

605
00:44:49,646 --> 00:44:51,231
The script of life

606
00:44:51,856 --> 00:44:55,026
If you can't find a replacement
But I insist on rewriting my fate

607
00:44:55,735 --> 00:44:57,070
The final scene will come

608
00:45:10,291 --> 00:45:12,085
Goodbye Misa

609
00:45:14,003 --> 00:45:16,464
Goodbye Misa

610
00:45:40,613 --> 00:45:45,493
I will never let you die again

611
00:48:46,883 --> 00:48:48,885
