1
00:00:19,228 --> 00:00:20,646
What?

2
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:21,564
Huh?

3
00:00:25,401 --> 00:00:27,236
So you don't need a ride anymore?

4
00:00:28,404 --> 00:00:30,448
What did I do to deserve all that?

5
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:32,575
What do you know about me anyway?

6
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:35,578
Your ankle...

7
00:00:36,954 --> 00:00:39,165
It's almost as if nothing happened at all.

8
00:00:42,293 --> 00:00:43,627
What's going on with them?

9
00:00:44,253 --> 00:00:45,296
A fight?

10
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:46,714
That's unusual.

11
00:01:00,853 --> 00:01:01,687
Huh?

12
00:01:09,111 --> 00:01:10,988
You asshole!

13
00:01:55,908 --> 00:01:56,867
Tomoya.

14
00:01:56,951 --> 00:01:57,785
Yes?

15
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:00,287
We're almost to Misa's place, right?

16
00:02:00,746 --> 00:02:01,664
I'm getting out, too.

17
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:03,123
Huh?

18
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:05,584
We need to talk.

19
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:08,128
Okay.

20
00:02:09,255 --> 00:02:10,089
Okay.

21
00:02:24,353 --> 00:02:25,729
I'm exhausted.

22
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,821
It's been so long
since I've been at your place.

23
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:35,030
Oh, yeah?

24
00:02:35,614 --> 00:02:37,992
'Cause you've been kind of cold
toward me lately.

25
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:40,953
Don't say that.

26
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,833
You really cleaned the place up.

27
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:47,960
Where's the picture board?

28
00:02:48,961 --> 00:02:50,880
I'm redecorating, so I put it away.

29
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:52,214
I see.

30
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:56,093
What's with the cactus?

31
00:02:56,719 --> 00:02:58,596
Oh, I found it at a flower shop.

32
00:02:59,889 --> 00:03:01,473
It looked cute, so I bought it.

33
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:12,234
But I was surprised.

34
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:15,529
You and Director Suzuki were...

35
00:03:16,906 --> 00:03:17,907
Does it bother you?

36
00:03:19,909 --> 00:03:21,327
Of course, it does!

37
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:26,040
I know how passionate you are,
but Tomoya and Miku were both shocked.

38
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:28,125
What were you doing
with the Director that day?

39
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,084
That day?

40
00:03:29,168 --> 00:03:30,753
On your way back from the reunion.

41
00:03:31,086 --> 00:03:33,964
You were walking under the same umbrella.

42
00:03:35,758 --> 00:03:36,592
That was--

43
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:37,509
That was?

44
00:03:39,845 --> 00:03:43,098
I happened to run into him
when I got lost looking for the station.

45
00:03:43,182 --> 00:03:44,516
He was just showing me the way.

46
00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:48,228
What a coincidence!

47
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:49,647
Yeah.

48
00:03:57,863 --> 00:03:59,031
<i>Oh, I get it now.</i>

49
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:04,453
<i>She can't stand it</i>
<i>when I have something better than her.</i>

50
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:07,539
Sorry, Director.

51
00:04:07,623 --> 00:04:08,457
Huh?

52
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:09,375
Nothing.

53
00:04:10,626 --> 00:04:13,420
So the fateful encounter
that you were talking about

54
00:04:13,504 --> 00:04:14,922
was Director Suzuki, huh?

55
00:04:16,215 --> 00:04:17,591
Who knows?

56
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:23,430
If so... that really worries me.

57
00:04:26,225 --> 00:04:28,352
Because, you know, it's well-known, right?

58
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:30,020
Huh?

59
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:31,981
Oh, you don't know?

60
00:04:32,064 --> 00:04:33,607
Oh, well...

61
00:04:34,108 --> 00:04:37,194
It's not like I don't know...

62
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,529
And you're okay with that?

63
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,198
Even though there are so many victims?

64
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,451
Hey, are you really sure?

65
00:04:44,952 --> 00:04:47,037
You do realize he's a shameless Noble Son,

66
00:04:47,121 --> 00:04:51,000
riding his CEO father's coattails to go
after every woman in the office,

67
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:52,459
from new recruits
all the way up the chain?

68
00:04:55,379 --> 00:04:58,590
Some women fall for him
without knowing what he really is.

69
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:01,510
Seriously, that guy, he'll go for anyone.

70
00:05:01,593 --> 00:05:03,721
He even hit on someone like me.

71
00:05:05,431 --> 00:05:09,184
He's the kind of guy none of the women
in the company take seriously.

72
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:14,231
So just the thought of you getting
caught up with a creep like that...

73
00:05:14,565 --> 00:05:15,691
I know!

74
00:05:16,525 --> 00:05:18,569
-What?
-I know everything.

75
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:21,864
He came on to me, so I just
played along to tease him, that's all.

76
00:05:22,364 --> 00:05:23,615
Oh, really?

77
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:25,284
Obviously!

78
00:05:25,367 --> 00:05:28,704
Of course, I would never take
a creep like that seriously!

79
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:30,998
That's my Reina!

80
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:32,207
What a relief!

81
00:05:34,418 --> 00:05:37,671
I'm sure you'll meet
someone wonderful eventually.

82
00:05:47,473 --> 00:05:50,267
{\an8}The hell are you thinking?
What's going on with you and that woman?

83
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,602
{\an8}TODAY
Come on, answer me

84
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:53,395
{\an8}Read the LINE message already.

85
00:05:57,524 --> 00:05:58,817
Good morning!

86
00:05:59,777 --> 00:06:00,778
Hey, Suzuki!

87
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:02,404
Yes?

88
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:12,247
What is it, sir?

89
00:06:13,082 --> 00:06:14,291
Start over again.

90
00:06:15,626 --> 00:06:17,252
Start over what part exactly?

91
00:06:18,253 --> 00:06:19,254
Everything.

92
00:06:19,338 --> 00:06:20,380
Make it more concise.

93
00:06:20,923 --> 00:06:23,300
But I summarized everything concisely.

94
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:24,218
Huh?

95
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:28,430
{\an8}Please tell me concisely
which part isn't concise.

96
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:30,808
{\an8}Well, I told you...

97
00:06:34,937 --> 00:06:35,854
Everything!

98
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:40,692
First of all, I submitted it
a month ago, didn't I?

99
00:06:40,776 --> 00:06:42,111
You sat on it all this time,

100
00:06:42,194 --> 00:06:44,613
and now you're piling on busy work
just before the event?

101
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:46,031
Some would call that harassment.

102
00:06:48,117 --> 00:06:49,034
Forget it.

103
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:50,953
Oh, really?

104
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:52,037
What a relief.

105
00:06:54,665 --> 00:06:57,835
Geez.

106
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:01,296
You'll never get promoted
acting like that!

107
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:08,554
Even the daughter of the CEO...

TOKYO OLYMPIC 2020

110
00:07:45,257 --> 00:07:48,385
Ms. Kanbe,
are you really sure he's the one?

111
00:07:49,011 --> 00:07:49,845
Huh?

112
00:07:49,928 --> 00:07:53,557
Marrying Hirano from sales,
are you seriously in your right mind?

113
00:07:53,891 --> 00:07:54,725
Hey, Miku.

114
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:57,060
I was observing, you know.

115
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:58,854
Observing?

116
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:03,400
-Next is...
-<i>Yuto is kind and considerate to everyone</i>

117
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:07,321
<i>and the director, well,</i>
<i>he might not be the friendliest,</i>

118
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:09,531
<i>but he takes on all the troublesome work.</i>

119
00:08:09,615 --> 00:08:11,950
<i>But that Tomoya Hirano guy...</i>

120
00:08:21,293 --> 00:08:22,502
Something on my face?

121
00:08:23,462 --> 00:08:24,630
Nope, nothing.

122
00:08:26,215 --> 00:08:27,257
Tastes great!

123
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:31,762
I would never trust a man

124
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:36,558
who hogs the best cuts
of meat at a barbecue.

125
00:08:37,935 --> 00:08:40,395
Ms. Kanbe,
your taste in men is seriously awful.

126
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,440
-You think this is a joke?
-Sorry.

127
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:46,818
Well, you know.
Hirano has his good points too.

128
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:48,362
He's honest.

129
00:08:49,321 --> 00:08:52,366
My brother is a hundred million times
better than that guy.

130
00:08:53,242 --> 00:08:54,076
Your brother?

131
00:08:55,077 --> 00:08:56,370
Oh, oh, nothing.

132
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:59,623
Miku, thank you for worrying about me.

133
00:09:00,499 --> 00:09:03,043
I've thought hard
about what comes next too.

134
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:17,808
Oh, I'm so full.

135
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:19,309
Yeah. I'm full too.

136
00:09:20,978 --> 00:09:22,104
Kanbe, wait!

137
00:09:23,397 --> 00:09:24,231
These.

138
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:25,482
Madeleines.

139
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:26,984
A treat for everyone.

140
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:28,735
Oh, thanks.

141
00:09:28,819 --> 00:09:30,153
They look really good!

142
00:09:32,948 --> 00:09:35,200
Congrats on your marriage.

143
00:09:37,828 --> 00:09:39,871
You're happy, right?

144
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:45,294
Yeah.

145
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:47,212
I'm glad.

146
00:09:48,422 --> 00:09:50,841

00:09:52,134 --> 00:09:54,970
Thanks for this.

00:09:57,055 --> 00:09:58,598
I got madeleines.

149
00:09:58,682 --> 00:09:59,766
Nice!

MAMEKAME-DOU

161
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:22,075
So...

162
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:27,914
Are we having a misunderstanding?

163
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,625
A misunderstanding?

164
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:33,211
Well...

165
00:12:34,588 --> 00:12:37,799
Oh, I'm sorry about
how I was treating you at work.

166
00:12:38,341 --> 00:12:41,636
I didn't want Reina to see us together.

167
00:12:42,637 --> 00:12:43,597
What do you mean?

168
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:47,350
I didn't want to make
you a target again...

169
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:48,268
A target?

170
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:49,311
Oh, no.

171
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:51,313
It's my problem now, so never mind.

172
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:58,904
And... I may have
spread a little...rumor...

173
00:13:00,405 --> 00:13:02,157
I did it.

174
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,074
A rumor?

175
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:10,332
I said you're a shameless Noble Son
chasing every skirt in the company.

176
00:13:10,415 --> 00:13:12,125
Oh, but I only told Reina.

177
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:16,880
Why would you tell lies about me to Esaka?

178
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:20,842
Because...

179
00:13:23,762 --> 00:13:26,223
I told you that Miku and I
are siblings, didn't I?

180
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:28,099
Are you still mad at me?

181
00:13:28,183 --> 00:13:29,893
That's not it. I'm not angry.

182
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:32,979
It's none of my business
whether you and Reina kissed or not.

183
00:13:33,063 --> 00:13:36,149
I would never spread false rumors
to Reina over something like that.

184
00:13:36,233 --> 00:13:39,486
Who you kiss or don't kiss
is seriously the last thing I care about!

185
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:40,820
I didn't!

186
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:42,489
What?

187
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:45,742
I didn't kiss Esaka.

188
00:13:47,077 --> 00:13:47,911
No, well, but...

189
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:50,288
Maybe it looked that way
from your angle...

190
00:13:50,372 --> 00:13:53,291
But we didn't. Absolutely not.
Two hundred percent, no!

191
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:55,377
There's no need to defend
yourself with excuses.

192
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,921
Excuses? Why would I need to make excuses?

193
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:01,800
Well, you don't.

194
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:07,138
I want to clear up any misunderstandings.

195
00:14:07,681 --> 00:14:10,350
I don't want to be misunderstood
by you in any way.

196
00:14:15,689 --> 00:14:19,734
I told Esaka I'm not interested.

197
00:14:21,111 --> 00:14:23,613
You...rejected Reina?

198
00:14:23,697 --> 00:14:28,952
Then she got right in my face
and said, "You asshole!"

199
00:14:33,915 --> 00:14:35,584
This is no laughing matter.

200
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:37,210
I'm sorry.

201
00:14:37,836 --> 00:14:38,920
That must've been...

202
00:14:41,256 --> 00:14:42,799
quite the ordeal!

203
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:44,843
It's not funny.

204
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:57,981
If you're laughing, then it's fine.

00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,203

206
00:15:13,204 --> 00:15:14,164
Yes.

207
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:21,546
I want to stop meeting like this
with just the two of us.

208
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:29,846
There's something I need to do.

What are you doing this weekend?

Misa.

229
00:17:06,443 --> 00:17:07,777
Good morning, Reina.

230
00:17:08,611 --> 00:17:10,113
Thanks for inviting me.

231
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:12,532
It's been a while, hasn't it?

232
00:17:12,615 --> 00:17:15,160
Yeah. I wanted to have a date with you.

233
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:16,828
Yay!

234
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:17,871
Where should we go?

235
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:20,081
Oh, do you want to go
to the Skytree Observatory?

236
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:24,502
-Sorry about the wait.
-Oh, good morning.

237
00:17:24,586 --> 00:17:25,962
Hey, you're late.

238
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,630
Huh? I'm right on time.

239
00:17:28,423 --> 00:17:30,508
Tomoya is coming too?

240
00:17:30,592 --> 00:17:32,135
Yeah. It'll be fun!

241
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:33,762
Right?

242
00:17:35,096 --> 00:17:37,223
So, Tomoya, where do you want to go?

243
00:17:38,433 --> 00:17:40,226
Want to walk around the old streets?

244
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:41,478
Good idea! Let's go!

245
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:42,520
Yeah.

246
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:00,371
So pretty!

247
00:18:00,455 --> 00:18:02,540
Yeah. Foreign tourists must like them.

00:18:02,624 --> 00:18:03,708

00:18:11,508 --> 00:18:12,550
Yeah.

251
00:18:12,634 --> 00:18:15,512
There are lots of shops that look good.

-Yeah.

00:18:23,311 --> 00:18:25,522
But it'll be a full-on
scrum to get tickets.

255
00:18:26,147 --> 00:18:28,358
-Well, I really hope you get 'em!
-Yeah.

256
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:30,693
I want to go see it with you!

257
00:18:33,488 --> 00:18:36,074
Wow. Hey, Tomoya. Isn't this cute!

258
00:18:38,493 --> 00:18:40,745
Wow. Hey, let's both get one to match.

259
00:18:40,829 --> 00:18:42,163
Huh?

260
00:18:42,247 --> 00:18:43,623
Where would you put this?

261
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:46,209
Hey, it's nice. I want it.

262
00:18:46,876 --> 00:18:49,045
Oh, Reina, let's get you one too!

263
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:51,339
No, I'll pass on this one.

264
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:53,091
Oh, really?

265
00:18:54,384 --> 00:18:56,135
I'll put this on my car keys.

266
00:18:56,219 --> 00:18:57,595
Oh, nice.

267
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,222
There's no going back now.

268
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:00,682
Let me buy you one.

269
00:19:00,765 --> 00:19:01,975
-Huh? Really?
-Yeah.

270
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:03,226
Yay!

271
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:06,271
Then... how about the pink one?

272
00:19:07,021 --> 00:19:08,982
-Sounds good. Yeah.
-Oh, really?

273
00:19:09,065 --> 00:19:10,859
-Then, this one, please.
-Okay.

274
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:12,735
Yay!

275
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:14,070
Excuse me. We'll take these.

276
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,530
Okay. Thank you.

277
00:19:16,364 --> 00:19:18,241
-This looks so good!
-Yeah.

278
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:20,034
Oh, Tomoya. Here you go!

279
00:19:23,955 --> 00:19:25,832
-How is it?
-Delicious.

280
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:29,377
It's on your lips. Sorry.

281
00:19:30,545 --> 00:19:31,963
-Am I cute?
-Stop it.

282
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,678
Ta-da!

283
00:19:38,761 --> 00:19:39,804

285
00:19:41,556 --> 00:19:43,182

00:19:43,266 --> 00:19:45,143
Cooking has always been your only talent.

287
00:19:45,226 --> 00:19:47,645
Hey, what do you mean "only"?

288
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:50,773
Okay, let's eat.

289
00:19:50,857 --> 00:19:52,775
I'll start with the fried chicken, okay?

290
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:53,985
I wonder how it is?

291
00:19:56,988 --> 00:19:58,239
Yum!

292
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:00,950
Misa, you're gonna be a great wife.

293
00:20:01,034 --> 00:20:02,535
Really? Thanks.

294
00:20:02,619 --> 00:20:05,121
I thought so when I
ate your curry for the first time.

295
00:20:05,997 --> 00:20:07,665
Here. Have some, Reina!

296
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:09,834
You're in a good mood.

297
00:20:09,918 --> 00:20:11,085
You think?

298
00:20:11,669 --> 00:20:13,463
You're so vocal today.

299
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:15,506
Like a new member of a theater troupe.

300
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,052
Oh, sorry.

301
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:20,303
I got carried away.

302
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:21,763
I've been working a lot lately,

303
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:24,515
so it's been a while
since I've had a day off like this.

304
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:26,768
And it's been a long time
since our last date, right?

305
00:20:26,851 --> 00:20:28,478
-Yeah.
-Is this okay?

306
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:29,562
Am I not intruding?

307
00:20:29,646 --> 00:20:30,605
Not at all.

308
00:20:30,688 --> 00:20:33,566
It's a lot more fun for us with you here.

309
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,569
Anyway, I'm sorry.

310
00:20:36,653 --> 00:20:38,696
Did I make you uncomfortable?

311
00:20:40,657 --> 00:20:41,866
Not at all.

312
00:20:42,492 --> 00:20:44,661
Really? Oh, have some. Have some.

313
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:46,412
Thanks.

314
00:20:47,455 --> 00:20:48,414

319
00:21:20,196 --> 00:21:24,492
We are making good progress,
but we are overspending on the budget.

320
00:21:25,326 --> 00:21:28,871
The project itself could use a review.

321
00:21:29,872 --> 00:21:32,667
It's a project
the chairman launched himself.

322
00:21:33,126 --> 00:21:38,715
The timing of the Olympics is perfect,
and it's a lifesaver for the company.

323
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:42,093
The chairman is counting on it,

324
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:45,596
and I'm counting on you.

325
00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:49,726
How's Miku doing?

326
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:54,063
She's always at your place
and never talks to us.

327
00:21:54,772 --> 00:21:57,775
I am still far
from being a future president.

328
00:22:04,615 --> 00:22:08,619
I've... always relied on you for so much.

329
00:22:34,228 --> 00:22:35,688
-Misa.
-Yeah?

330
00:22:37,106 --> 00:22:38,399
Pat my head.

331
00:22:39,067 --> 00:22:40,276
Here, here.

332
00:22:42,195 --> 00:22:43,571
Do you like me?

333
00:22:43,654 --> 00:22:46,657
Hey. What are you saying
in a place like this?

334
00:22:47,909 --> 00:22:49,410
You're embarrassed.

335
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:54,916
There are a lot of houses
to choose from...

336
00:22:55,374 --> 00:23:00,046
But when I get married,
I think I want a new apartment.

337
00:23:00,713 --> 00:23:04,550
Yeah, I know, but they're so expensive.

338
00:23:05,009 --> 00:23:06,344
But, Tomoya,

339
00:23:06,427 --> 00:23:09,514
your virtual currency thing
is going well, isn't it?

340
00:23:10,515 --> 00:23:11,349
Well...

341
00:23:15,686 --> 00:23:18,022
I've been making good money.

342
00:23:19,524 --> 00:23:21,025
-Right now it's...
-Yeah.

343
00:23:21,776 --> 00:23:23,653
up about 3.5 times what I paid for it.

344
00:23:23,736 --> 00:23:25,780
Huh? So then, how much have you made?

345
00:23:26,906 --> 00:23:28,533
Nearly 10 million?

346
00:23:28,616 --> 00:23:29,617
Wow!

347
00:23:30,827 --> 00:23:34,122
Honestly, slaving away at a job
feels dumber by the day.

348
00:23:34,205 --> 00:23:37,416
I knew it, Tomoya,
you're a natural investor!

349
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,960
Should we buy a new apartment?

350
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:43,631
As long as we're together,
I'll live anywhere.

351
00:23:44,132 --> 00:23:45,341
What?

352
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:46,968
-You're so cute.
-Sorry!

353
00:23:47,051 --> 00:23:48,386
Restroom, be right back.

354
00:24:05,111 --> 00:24:06,320
This is brutal!

355
00:24:09,824 --> 00:24:10,700
But...

356
00:24:13,995 --> 00:24:15,496
It's getting to her.

357
00:24:16,831 --> 00:24:19,000
She's totally pissed!

358
00:24:19,834 --> 00:24:21,460
Yes!

359
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:28,384
I've really turned into a terrible person.

360
00:24:33,764 --> 00:24:35,349
But that's just fine.

361
00:24:43,983 --> 00:24:45,276
Here you are.

362
00:26:30,047 --> 00:26:31,966
-Here you go, Tomoya.
-Looks incredible.

363
00:26:32,049 --> 00:26:33,050
-Oh, thanks.
-Right?

364
00:26:33,134 --> 00:26:34,385
-Yay, looks good.
-Let's eat.

365
00:26:34,468 --> 00:26:35,720
Yes. Let's eat.

366
00:26:35,803 --> 00:26:37,179
Let's eat.

367
00:26:40,391 --> 00:26:44,103
Hey, Tomoya,
don't you like curry a little too much?

368
00:26:44,186 --> 00:26:46,105
-You're always eating it.
-That's true.

369
00:26:46,188 --> 00:26:47,732
-But, yeah.
-Yeah.

370
00:26:47,815 --> 00:26:49,233
You guys are so lovey-dovey.

371
00:26:50,526 --> 00:26:52,611
-Really good!
-Yeah, delicious!

372
00:26:58,576 --> 00:27:01,370
Dad was worried about you.

373
00:27:02,163 --> 00:27:03,039
Really?

374
00:27:03,372 --> 00:27:07,084
Instead of always mooching off of me,
how about eating with him once in a while?

375
00:27:08,002 --> 00:27:10,087
I'm worried about you.

376
00:27:10,755 --> 00:27:13,424
I told you that drama with
Ms. Esaka was a misunderstanding.

377
00:27:13,507 --> 00:27:16,302
I'm not talking about that,
I'm talking about Ms. Kanbe.

378
00:27:17,094 --> 00:27:19,138
She's been acting strange lately.

379
00:27:19,221 --> 00:27:23,392
Nothing good ever comes from folks
finding out you're dating someone at work.

380
00:27:23,476 --> 00:27:26,604
She's making a show out of
flirting with that total loser,

381
00:27:26,687 --> 00:27:30,274
and she's back to playing best friends
with that awful woman.

382
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,863
You really okay with that?

383
00:27:36,447 --> 00:27:37,907
Stay out of it.

384
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:38,824
I mean, think about it.

385
00:27:38,908 --> 00:27:42,495
Just happening to run into your
old school crush at work?

386
00:27:42,578 --> 00:27:44,830
That's nothing short of a miracle.

387
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:51,087
Even with Grandpa pressuring you,

388
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:54,131
you knew Ms. Kanbe was still
out there somewhere, am I right?

389
00:27:54,215 --> 00:27:55,299
That's not true.

390
00:27:59,261 --> 00:28:00,596
Do you understand?

391
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:05,768
If you pass up a once-in-a-lifetime chance
like this, you're an irredeemable dumbass.

392
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,771
I know that.

393
00:28:09,355 --> 00:28:10,189
Huh?

394
00:28:11,273 --> 00:28:12,108
That's why...

395
00:28:15,986 --> 00:28:17,696
I'm not going to just walk away.

396
00:28:18,781 --> 00:28:20,324
I see.

397
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:33,170
Oh... I look good.

398
00:28:37,758 --> 00:28:39,468
Did you miss me?

399
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:41,095
Sorry about the sudden invite.

400
00:28:41,178 --> 00:28:42,471
It's no problem at all.

401
00:28:42,555 --> 00:28:44,557
Misa has to work overtime today.

402
00:28:45,057 --> 00:28:46,308
Hey, can I get a highball?

403
00:28:46,392 --> 00:28:47,226
Coming right up.

404
00:28:48,644 --> 00:28:50,479
You guys are so lovey-dovey recently.

405
00:28:51,397 --> 00:28:52,731
You could say that.

406
00:28:53,482 --> 00:28:54,775
Reina, you said the other day

407
00:28:54,859 --> 00:28:58,195
that some girls start to hesitate
when they decide to get married.

408
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,782
I thought it might be the opposite
in Misa's case.

409
00:29:02,408 --> 00:29:05,411
She's completely locked on
to me now, you know?

410
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:07,746
Really?

411
00:29:09,331 --> 00:29:13,752
I swear, being such a
babe magnet ought to be illegal.

412
00:29:15,838 --> 00:29:18,632
If that's a crime, then Misa
might just be your punishment.

413
00:29:19,842 --> 00:29:20,676
Huh?

414
00:29:21,218 --> 00:29:23,721
Misa recently started Instagram, you know?

415
00:29:24,597 --> 00:29:28,767
But Misa's no good at social media, so...

416
00:29:28,851 --> 00:29:31,562
She's also following Yuto.

417
00:29:31,645 --> 00:29:32,480
Huh?

418
00:29:32,563 --> 00:29:33,397
YUTO.TANABE - 6 DAYS AGO

419
00:29:33,481 --> 00:29:35,191
MISA_0816 THANK YOU FOR HAVING US!

420
00:29:38,819 --> 00:29:40,446
Oh, you didn't know?

421
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:44,158
Don't tell me
she's not following you, Tomoya.

422
00:29:45,451 --> 00:29:47,161
That can't be.

423
00:29:48,537 --> 00:29:53,250
Well... these days, social media
is used for work too, so...

424
00:29:56,086 --> 00:29:58,839
Come to think of it,

425
00:29:58,923 --> 00:30:01,884
Misa said that Director Suzuki
made a pass at her too...

426
00:30:05,596 --> 00:30:07,515
She didn't tell you about it?

427
00:30:10,184 --> 00:30:11,769
Oh, well...

428
00:30:12,144 --> 00:30:15,814
Maybe she was keeping it a secret
to not worry you.

429
00:30:16,315 --> 00:30:17,149
Here you are.

430
00:30:27,576 --> 00:30:32,248
You know, they say even if you don't
want to turn out like your parents,

431
00:30:32,331 --> 00:30:35,084
in the end, the apple
never falls far from the tree.

432
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:38,712
What do you mean?

433
00:30:42,049 --> 00:30:43,342
Haven't you heard?

434
00:30:51,267 --> 00:30:54,728
The Olympics gets postponed
and there will be no spectators...

435
00:30:55,271 --> 00:30:56,105
What?

436
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:57,565
Oh, nothing.

437
00:30:59,567 --> 00:31:04,029
About this project for foreign tourists,
is there a chance we could cancel it?

438
00:31:04,113 --> 00:31:05,447
Huh? That's impossible.

439
00:31:05,531 --> 00:31:07,950
This is a big project
our company is counting on.

440
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:09,368
You're right.

441
00:31:09,451 --> 00:31:11,537
Sorry, I have to go get my daughter.

442
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:13,497
I'm going home too. See you tomorrow.

443
00:31:13,581 --> 00:31:14,582
See you tomorrow.

444
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:19,295
Alrighty.

445
00:31:26,802 --> 00:31:27,636
Yes.

446
00:31:29,179 --> 00:31:32,683
Huh? Setting up the meeting date
with your parents?

447
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:34,810
Does it have to be today?

448
00:31:37,062 --> 00:31:39,607
Oh, sorry, I'll call you back in a bit.

449
00:31:44,987 --> 00:31:46,363
See you tomorrow.

450
00:31:46,447 --> 00:31:48,198
What are you thinking?

451
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:55,372
Are you going to make
the same mistake again?

452
00:31:57,082 --> 00:31:58,292
It has nothing to do with you.

453
00:32:09,595 --> 00:32:11,388
I'm here for you.

454
00:32:32,201 --> 00:32:35,245
Stop talking like you understand,

455
00:32:35,329 --> 00:32:37,998
when you clearly have
no idea what's going on.

456
00:32:40,042 --> 00:32:42,753
If I leave it to someone else,
it'll be the same as before.

457
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:46,048
I don't need anyone's help.

458
00:33:14,785 --> 00:33:15,786
Hey.

459
00:33:22,835 --> 00:33:23,919
Were you drinking?

460
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:26,213
Yeah, a little bit.

461
00:33:28,132 --> 00:33:30,384
So the date of the face-to-face meeting.

462
00:33:30,467 --> 00:33:33,721
I won't know my work schedule
until after the Olympics tasting event,

463
00:33:33,804 --> 00:33:35,723
so can we wait a little longer to decide?

464
00:33:36,223 --> 00:33:37,391
That's fine.

465
00:33:38,058 --> 00:33:40,310
I respect your work.

466
00:33:42,604 --> 00:33:45,733
Oh, I'm fine here.
Thanks for walking me home.

467
00:33:45,816 --> 00:33:47,359
Why did you change the locks?

468
00:33:47,443 --> 00:33:48,318
Huh?

469
00:33:48,402 --> 00:33:50,612
These are the new keys and the invoice.

470
00:33:50,696 --> 00:33:51,864
Thank you very much.

471
00:33:51,947 --> 00:33:53,240
Have a good evening.

472
00:33:53,657 --> 00:33:55,951
I was going to wait in your room,

473
00:33:57,327 --> 00:33:59,204
but I couldn't use the spare key.

474
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:02,875
Hilarious.

475
00:34:04,626 --> 00:34:06,378
I lost my key.

476
00:34:06,462 --> 00:34:08,338
I had to get the locks changed.

477
00:34:09,089 --> 00:34:10,257
Oh, really?

478
00:34:12,134 --> 00:34:13,927
Why were you holding hands?

479
00:34:15,971 --> 00:34:16,805
Huh?

480
00:34:18,724 --> 00:34:21,643
I went to find you
at the second planning department.

481
00:34:22,394 --> 00:34:24,688
You were holding hands
with Director Suzuki, right?

482
00:34:27,566 --> 00:34:28,567
What was that about?

483
00:34:29,651 --> 00:34:30,486
Well...

484
00:34:32,112 --> 00:34:33,322
It's okay.

485
00:34:33,906 --> 00:34:35,908
Let's have a nice long talk in your room.

486
00:34:40,621 --> 00:34:42,122
What are you afraid of?

487
00:34:42,581 --> 00:34:44,374
I'm your fiancé, aren't I?

488
00:34:45,125 --> 00:34:46,084
Let's have some fun.

489
00:34:46,168 --> 00:34:48,003
That old town date
was a total blast, right?

490
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:49,379
You should go home.

491
00:34:49,463 --> 00:34:50,506
There it is again.

492
00:34:51,298 --> 00:34:53,509
What's wrong
with me going over to your place?

493
00:34:54,134 --> 00:34:57,805
Oh, maybe there's someone in your room?

494
00:34:58,305 --> 00:34:59,848
Is it your first love, Yuto?

495
00:34:59,932 --> 00:35:02,017
-What?
-You're amazing.

496
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,436
You say you're working late,
but you're meeting a guy,

497
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,230
and when you go home,
there's a different guy.

498
00:35:06,313 --> 00:35:07,189
How would I even...

499
00:35:07,272 --> 00:35:09,525
The apple never falls far from the tree.

500
00:35:11,777 --> 00:35:12,611
What do you mean?

501
00:35:12,694 --> 00:35:17,491
Your mother... left your family
to run off with another man, didn't she?

502
00:35:22,246 --> 00:35:23,914
You heard from Reina.

503
00:35:24,331 --> 00:35:25,374
It doesn't matter.

504
00:35:26,834 --> 00:35:29,002
It doesn't matter, yeah. Good night.

505
00:35:31,672 --> 00:35:33,882
I'm giving you the chance
to explain yourself

506
00:35:33,966 --> 00:35:35,175
while I'm still asking nicely.

507
00:35:35,801 --> 00:35:37,928
Why'd you lie about overtime
to see another guy?

508
00:35:38,011 --> 00:35:39,721
Why' d you change the lock
without telling me?

509
00:35:39,805 --> 00:35:41,890
I don't want you just barging in!

510
00:35:58,574 --> 00:35:59,616
Misa...

511
00:36:01,743 --> 00:36:02,828
Are you done?

512
00:37:45,639 --> 00:37:47,766
You know that cafe
in front of the station?

513
00:37:48,767 --> 00:37:51,937
The waiter there is really handsome.

514
00:37:52,896 --> 00:37:55,357
And you know Ms. Takahashi?

515
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,442
She seems to be locked on to that guy.

516
00:37:57,526 --> 00:37:58,610
Isn't that funny?

517
00:38:03,031 --> 00:38:04,116
Misa?

518
00:38:05,909 --> 00:38:07,077
Misa?

519
00:38:07,786 --> 00:38:09,037
Misa, are you listening?

520
00:38:09,121 --> 00:38:11,456
What's wrong? You're spacing out.

521
00:38:14,418 --> 00:38:16,086
Did something happen with Tomoya?

522
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,466
Actually, he asked me about it.

523
00:38:22,467 --> 00:38:25,554
Tomoya was suspicious about you and Yuto.

524
00:38:26,972 --> 00:38:29,975
I'm not sure jealous men can
really handle a marriage...

525
00:38:31,101 --> 00:38:35,272
If you have even the slightest hesitation,
maybe you should reconsider.

526
00:38:36,189 --> 00:38:40,068
Marriage isn't everything nowadays,
and you'll always have me!

527
00:38:45,282 --> 00:38:49,411
I want nothing more
than for you to be happy.

528
00:38:58,211 --> 00:38:59,463
Kanbe...

529
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:10,974
So...

530
00:39:12,184 --> 00:39:13,977
I'm really sorry about yesterday.

531
00:39:15,937 --> 00:39:17,981
I was a little drunk and...

532
00:39:18,482 --> 00:39:20,942
Well, that's no excuse, but...

533
00:39:22,235 --> 00:39:23,695
I'm really, really sorry.

534
00:39:28,283 --> 00:39:29,117
So...

535
00:39:31,787 --> 00:39:32,746
Look! Check it out!

536
00:39:32,829 --> 00:39:33,830
TSUZUKU TOWN CORPORATION

537
00:39:33,914 --> 00:39:36,792
I've made a tentative reservation
for our future home.

538
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:39,127
It's new. Just built.

539
00:39:39,669 --> 00:39:41,338
And it's a corner unit.

540
00:39:42,297 --> 00:39:44,466
Well, it's a little over our budget,

541
00:39:44,549 --> 00:39:48,011
but I have my investment income and
you have your savings.

542
00:39:48,095 --> 00:39:51,389
And I'm sure my mother
will help us out if I beg her.

543
00:39:52,015 --> 00:39:55,519
Oh, my mom has given me
some dates for the meeting.

544
00:39:56,144 --> 00:39:59,856
We need to reserve the restaurant,

545
00:40:00,315 --> 00:40:03,401
Well, for Saturdays and Sundays,
my mom can make it on--

546
00:40:03,485 --> 00:40:05,529
You think I'm going to forgive you, right?

547
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:08,240
Huh?

548
00:40:10,617 --> 00:40:12,661
You think that no matter what you do,

549
00:40:13,537 --> 00:40:16,665
you think you can charm your way
out of it every time.

550
00:40:17,374 --> 00:40:18,500
Huh?

551
00:40:19,501 --> 00:40:21,253
How long are you gonna keep this up?

552
00:40:22,587 --> 00:40:24,005
What do you even want?

553
00:40:24,381 --> 00:40:26,758
I apologized, didn't I?
I even bowed my head.

554
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:30,095
I even reserved that
new apartment you wanted to live in.

555
00:40:31,888 --> 00:40:34,766
So now that I'm being nice,
you're gonna take advantage of it?

556
00:40:34,850 --> 00:40:36,434
You started this whole thing, you know?

557
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:38,145
Me?

558
00:40:38,228 --> 00:40:39,980
You're the one that got me angry.

559
00:40:40,063 --> 00:40:42,691
Don't ignore it and act like a victim!

560
00:40:51,366 --> 00:40:55,245
Why am I still with him in my second life?

561
00:40:55,787 --> 00:40:56,663
Huh?

562
00:40:59,749 --> 00:41:01,459
I'm not going to meet your mother.

563
00:41:01,877 --> 00:41:03,712
I don't want to meet your parents.

564
00:41:04,379 --> 00:41:06,381
I don't want to spend
another second with you.

565
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:08,300
I don't want to marry you.

566
00:41:11,052 --> 00:41:12,220
Let's break up.

567
00:41:18,685 --> 00:41:19,853
What about the apartment?

568
00:41:22,355 --> 00:41:24,900
I just need to cancel the contract, right?

569
00:41:50,050 --> 00:41:50,884
Thank you.

570
00:41:55,972 --> 00:41:59,976
I have a tentative reservation
for an apartment in Honcho District Four.

571
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:04,981
I see. If that is the case,
please come directly to the office.

572
00:42:05,899 --> 00:42:08,860
Can you meet me on site
in front of the apartment?

573
00:42:09,402 --> 00:42:11,947
Yes, thank you for your time.

574
00:42:15,283 --> 00:42:18,453
{\an8}The apartment in Honcho District Four
has been canceled.

575
00:42:19,371 --> 00:42:22,249
{\an8}If it's a cancellation,
why are you going to meet on site?

576
00:42:24,459 --> 00:42:25,293
{\an8}Good point.

577
00:42:32,926 --> 00:42:33,969
What are you doing?

578
00:42:34,970 --> 00:42:37,639
I thought you weren't going
to talk to me at the office?

579
00:42:38,139 --> 00:42:39,140
True.

580
00:42:39,224 --> 00:42:41,101
I am meeting up with Ms. Kanbe.

581
00:42:41,184 --> 00:42:42,435
As a colleague.

582
00:42:42,852 --> 00:42:46,564
She wasn't herself today, so I got worried
and invited her out for a drink.

583
00:42:46,648 --> 00:42:48,608
But it looks like she's running late.

584
00:42:48,692 --> 00:42:50,944
She said she'd come after
canceling the apartment.

585
00:42:51,403 --> 00:42:52,237
The apartment?

586
00:42:52,654 --> 00:42:53,780
An apartment in Honcho.

587
00:42:56,074 --> 00:42:58,326
Mr. Hirano signed the lease
without asking.

588
00:42:59,786 --> 00:43:00,704
Huh?

589
00:43:07,627 --> 00:43:10,672
-Thank you very much.
-Yes, thank you. Take care.

590
00:43:25,979 --> 00:43:27,230
UNDER MAINTENANCE

591
00:43:27,314 --> 00:43:29,316
EMERGENCY STAIRS

592
00:43:56,426 --> 00:43:59,637
It's because of marrying you
that my life went to hell.

593
00:43:59,721 --> 00:44:02,349
My life's a failure because of you!

594
00:44:02,432 --> 00:44:04,684
Are you really making me
the villain over a single mistake?

595
00:44:04,768 --> 00:44:07,062
You've been an eyesore since we were kids.

596
00:44:07,145 --> 00:44:08,563
We were never friends.

597
00:44:16,613 --> 00:44:19,449
I said hand it over!

598
00:44:21,368 --> 00:44:23,661
Stop it, damn it!

599
00:44:34,214 --> 00:44:36,591
<i>What happens, happens.</i>

600
00:44:42,347 --> 00:44:43,765
Stop it, damn it! Shit...

601
00:44:49,646 --> 00:44:51,231
<i>Thus is the script of life.</i>

602
00:44:51,856 --> 00:44:55,026
<i>Try to force a change of fate with</i>
<i>no one to take your place… </i>

603
00:44:55,735 --> 00:44:57,070
<i>and your story ends.</i>

604
00:45:10,291 --> 00:45:12,085
Bye-bye, Misa.

605
00:45:14,003 --> 00:45:16,464
Bye-bye, Misa.

606
00:45:40,613 --> 00:45:45,493
I'm never... going to let you die again.
