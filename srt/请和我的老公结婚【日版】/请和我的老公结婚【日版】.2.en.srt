1
00:00:39,165 --> 00:00:40,750
Are you okay?

2
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:42,126
Are you not feeling well?

3
00:00:43,294 --> 00:00:44,420
Oh, no...

4
00:00:47,006 --> 00:00:48,048
This little one...

5
00:00:49,341 --> 00:00:53,095
I was just worried
the pond might dry up over summer break.

6
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:56,056
I see.

7
00:00:59,685 --> 00:01:01,187
Hope it rains.

8
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:03,939
Yeah.

9
00:01:19,413 --> 00:01:20,831
Good morning, Kamekichi.

10
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:23,459
Did you eat breakfast?

11
00:01:25,252 --> 00:01:26,796
I'll be back after first period, okay?

12
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,849
No! Look, doesn't that side look better?

13
00:01:38,933 --> 00:01:40,726
It gets more sun. See?

14
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:42,728
Come on, come on! That way!

15
00:01:42,812 --> 00:01:44,730
That way! Come on!

16
00:01:44,814 --> 00:01:46,774
Hey, this area is no fun, see?

17
00:01:46,857 --> 00:01:49,109
Over there! That side looks more fun!

18
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:06,585
Hey, Kamekichi,
I've always wondered if these are oranges.

19
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:09,171
Do you think they're edible?

20
00:02:10,381 --> 00:02:12,508
Oh, it's tough!

21
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,889
So tough!

22
00:02:18,973 --> 00:02:21,350
Come on... There.

23
00:02:28,524 --> 00:02:29,567
So sour!

24
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:31,569
Oh, no.

25
00:02:41,287 --> 00:02:42,746
I guess they're not edible.

26
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:57,303
So, you've decided on your path.

27
00:02:57,386 --> 00:02:58,262
Yes.

28
00:02:58,971 --> 00:03:01,974
I'll be accompanying my father
on his overseas tour from September.

29
00:03:05,102 --> 00:03:09,106
It's people like you
that I wish would stay at the university.

30
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:15,571
I'll save the dream
of being a researcher for my next life.

31
00:03:32,338 --> 00:03:33,881
I'm sorry, excuse me.

32
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:30,229
I can't believe he passed away so soon.

33
00:04:30,312 --> 00:04:34,191
Yeah, it's such a shock to see
someone so young go.

34
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:35,317
Yeah.

35
00:04:35,401 --> 00:04:38,654
Shigeo was so much younger than us.

36
00:04:38,737 --> 00:04:39,822
So much younger...

37
00:04:39,905 --> 00:04:43,867
-Poor guy...
-Yeah, such a shame...

38
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:01,635
No...

39
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:07,933
Kamekichi.

40
00:05:14,857 --> 00:05:17,067
Where are you, Kamekichi?

41
00:05:24,158 --> 00:05:26,785
Kamekichi. Kamekichi.

42
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:10,704
DON'T WORRY
THE TURTLE IS SAFE WITH ME

43
00:06:31,809 --> 00:06:38,816
2015

44
00:07:30,534 --> 00:07:31,743
Good morning, Kamekichi.

45
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:39,251
<i>For example, what if a scenario</i>
<i>like this played out in her life...</i>

46
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,049
Good morning, Kamekichi.

47
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,218
Did you eat breakfast?

48
00:07:48,302 --> 00:07:51,471
<i>-...I'd be an unnamed background extra.</i>
-I'll be back after first period.

49
00:07:53,849 --> 00:07:55,475
I'm sorry, excuse me.

50
00:07:57,186 --> 00:07:58,478
<i>Not even in focus.</i>

51
00:07:58,562 --> 00:07:59,897
<i>Just Student A.</i>

52
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,817
Now then,
what is your motivation for applying?

53
00:08:03,901 --> 00:08:04,943
Yes.

54
00:08:05,027 --> 00:08:06,486
When I was a little girl,

55
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:10,741
my father used to leave me a treat
on the table for when I came home.

56
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:14,286
Suzutoya's strawberry milk candy
would always fill me with joy and...

57
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:15,412
<i>Interviewer B.</i>

58
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:18,916
Oh, I'm sorry. Sorry.

59
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:20,751
Oh, sorry.

60
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:22,836
Sorry to keep you waiting!

61
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:26,048
<i>Boss C.</i>

62
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:44,733
Misa!

63
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,152
Do you want to watch the World Cup?

64
00:08:47,236 --> 00:08:48,946
-Soccer?
-No, rugby.

65
00:08:49,321 --> 00:08:50,948
I'm going to watch it at a sports bar

66
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:52,699
with the guys from the rugby team.

67
00:08:52,783 --> 00:08:55,786
-I want to introduce you to them.
-What? I'm nervous!

68
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:58,914
-Would I understand the rules?
-Don't worry. I'll teach you.

69
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:01,416
<i>A background extra with no lines.</i>

70
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:03,710
-Here, your birthday present!
-What?

71
00:09:04,503 --> 00:09:06,546
-Wear it to work too, okay?
-Okay, thanks!

72
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:08,382
Hey, you guys are late!

73
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:10,050
-We have a reservation!
-Sorry, sorry.

74
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:11,593
Sorry, the chief wouldn't let us go.

75
00:09:11,677 --> 00:09:12,511
Let's go!

76
00:09:12,844 --> 00:09:14,596
Oh, man, I'm so hungry.

77
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,140
<i>I never would have</i>
<i>been a part of her story...</i>

78
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,268
<i>Or so it seemed.</i>

00:09:20,978 --> 00:09:24,189
<i>But on September 18th, 2015.</i>

80
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:29,486
Sorry!

<i>She jumped in out of nowhere.</i>

82
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:40,789
My apologies.

83
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:44,293
<i>I got flustered,</i>
<i>and said the worst possible thing.</i>

84
00:09:45,544 --> 00:09:47,504
That scarf doesn't suit you.

85
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:51,717
Please keep it there
until the heat goes away.

86
00:10:01,685 --> 00:10:03,061
I'm really sorry.

87
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,604
Director Suzuki.

88
00:10:09,484 --> 00:10:13,280
I'm sorry for saying such rude things.

89
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:16,992
Likewise.

90
00:10:20,912 --> 00:10:22,122
BOSS C

91
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:23,832
DIRECTOR SUZUKI

92
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:31,965
What now, Kamekichi?

93
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:34,343
This is a new development.

94
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:02,621
Good morning.

95
00:11:04,456 --> 00:11:05,582
Good morning.

96
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:07,209
Is the burn...

97
00:11:19,513 --> 00:11:22,391
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

98
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,609
Misa! Morning!

99
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:36,071
You've been an eyesore since we were kids.

100
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,073
We were never friends.

101
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:41,284
Morning, Reina!

102
00:11:41,785 --> 00:11:44,538
Again, congrats on your engagement.

103
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:46,581
Thanks!

104
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:52,254
Weren't you talking to Director Suzuki
from Corporate Strategy earlier?

105
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:53,964
Yeah.

106
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:55,632
Since when did you two know each other?

107
00:11:56,425 --> 00:11:59,302
On the day of the presentation,
I bumped into him in the elevator.

108
00:11:59,845 --> 00:12:01,304
I see.

109
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:05,809
So you're on greeting terms
with the Noble Son now!

110
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:07,769
Oh, that's nice.

111
00:12:07,853 --> 00:12:10,272
I can't believe
the Noble Son recognizes you.

112
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:12,899
-The... Noble Son?
-Director Suzuki.

113
00:12:12,983 --> 00:12:15,068
Grandson of the Chairman
and son of the CEO.

114
00:12:15,152 --> 00:12:16,153
What?

115
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:18,280
-He's good-looking, right?
-Yeah.

116
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:21,116
I heard he was in our commercials
when he was a child.

117
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:22,033
I saw it on YouTube.

118
00:12:22,117 --> 00:12:23,243
That commercial?

119
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:24,161
Yeah.

120
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:28,331
He's good at his job, and his curtness
just makes him even more attractive!

121
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:29,833
Isn't he single?

122
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:31,126
<i>Noble Son...</i>

123
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:34,796
<i>Come to think of it, I remember a boss</i>
<i>who had that nickname...</i>

124
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,214
<i>So it was him.</i>

125
00:12:36,298 --> 00:12:38,758
Misa, you're bored already!

126
00:12:39,384 --> 00:12:42,053
You never were interested
in company gossip, were you?

127
00:12:44,139 --> 00:12:45,223
Ms. Esaka.

128
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:48,477
The quote.

129
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,561
What's the status?

130
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,898
Oh... I'll do it now.

131
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:55,734
Didn't I ask you to finish it last week?

132
00:12:57,319 --> 00:13:00,530
Sorry. I had so many other things to do.

133
00:13:01,323 --> 00:13:03,325
Ms. Esaka, please keep your promises.

134
00:13:04,743 --> 00:13:07,662
You're in a position
to teach new hires, you know.

135
00:13:08,663 --> 00:13:11,750
Okay, I'll be careful.

136
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:14,544
Ms. Sumiyoshi, you're in a new suit!

137
00:13:14,628 --> 00:13:15,545
Yeah.

138
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:18,965
It's been ages
since I bought clothes for myself.

139
00:13:19,049 --> 00:13:20,634
The mortgage is killing me.

140
00:13:42,197 --> 00:13:43,240
Hey, Misa.

141
00:13:43,949 --> 00:13:44,866
Hey.

142
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:45,867
Did you see my LINE?

143
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:47,494
LINE?

144
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:52,999
I looked up a bunch of wedding venues!
Check out these links!

145
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:55,085
Let's go.

146
00:14:07,222 --> 00:14:09,140
It's kind of strange, isn't it?

147
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:12,227
The fact that none of the people here
know anything about it.

148
00:14:12,686 --> 00:14:13,520
Strange?

149
00:14:14,396 --> 00:14:15,480
You know...

150
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:21,611
That you're my fiancée.

151
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:27,742
Curry lunch, please!

152
00:14:28,451 --> 00:14:29,995
All right.

153
00:14:38,753 --> 00:14:40,797
I think I'll stay at your place tonight.

154
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:44,551
Let's eat.

155
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:47,596
Let's eat.

156
00:14:48,763 --> 00:14:49,889
<i>He's so vile.</i>

157
00:14:49,973 --> 00:14:52,434
<i>I don't even want</i>
<i>to breathe the same air anymore.</i>

158
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:56,521
<i>Curry...</i>

159
00:14:58,148 --> 00:15:00,525
What do you think I married you for?

160
00:15:00,609 --> 00:15:02,819
The reason I married
a boring, dull girl like you

161
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:05,363
is because you're a stingy woman
who saves money.

162
00:15:06,448 --> 00:15:08,575
<i>What you married me for?</i>

163
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:13,038
<i>I will never marry this person!</i>

164
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,457
Oh, yeah, Misa.

165
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:19,461
You know how you left early
from the sports bar the other night?

166
00:15:20,503 --> 00:15:21,713
Oh, yeah.

167
00:15:21,796 --> 00:15:23,673
You felt awkward, right?

168
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:25,425
Awkward?

169
00:15:26,009 --> 00:15:31,181
To be honest, you're a bit plain compared
to the girls I'm used to seeing around me,

170
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:33,183
and I can understand
why you might feel insecure,

171
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:37,646
but it doesn't matter what people think,
whether or not you're a good match.

172
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:39,773
Don't lose confidence.

173
00:15:41,483 --> 00:15:43,485
Because you're the one I've chosen.

174
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:47,739
<i>How arrogant can you be?</i>

175
00:15:48,823 --> 00:15:51,451
I can't wait for you to meet my mom.

176
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:53,703
When should we meet the parents?

177
00:15:55,038 --> 00:15:55,914
<i>Meet the parents...</i>

178
00:15:55,997 --> 00:16:01,294
You can keep your job,
but it's no excuse to skip housework.

179
00:16:01,753 --> 00:16:04,589
Before the wedding,
could I see a fertility certificate?

180
00:16:04,673 --> 00:16:08,426
I knew you couldn't handle it...
A girl without parents.

181
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:09,928
When should we do it?

182
00:16:10,512 --> 00:16:12,514
My mom's pretty busy.

183
00:16:14,265 --> 00:16:17,143
<i>How could I not see</i>
<i>this guy's true colors?</i>

184
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:21,189
Look at this.

185
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:22,982
This sticker's hilarious.

186
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:27,654
<i>He's a self-centered,</i>
<i>emotionally abusive, momma's boy!</i>

187
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:30,281
Oh, you know about cryptocurrency?

188
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:35,203
So nowadays, depositing money in a bank
is just a waste of assets and time.

189
00:16:35,286 --> 00:16:38,623
There is this Durkis coin,
which the general public can't buy,

190
00:16:38,707 --> 00:16:42,001
but one of the older guys from the rugby
team is going to show me a way in.

191
00:16:42,085 --> 00:16:43,336
I see.

192
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:44,629
<i>That's a scam.</i>

193
00:16:44,713 --> 00:16:46,840
<i>He'll be cheated out of all his money.</i>

194
00:16:47,215 --> 00:16:50,260
<i>And on top of that,</i>
<i>he's a narcissist of the highest order.</i>

195
00:16:51,302 --> 00:16:52,804
<i>I want to punch myself.</i>

196
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:54,639
<i>How could I not see this coming?</i>

197
00:16:57,892 --> 00:16:59,686
Oh, you're so cute together.

198
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:00,729
Oh, Reina!

199
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:05,400
I'm leaving now. Sit there.

200
00:17:05,984 --> 00:17:06,901
Oh, why?

201
00:17:07,277 --> 00:17:08,570
They need me right now.

202
00:17:08,653 --> 00:17:10,238
So, by all means, sit there.

203
00:17:14,284 --> 00:17:16,786
I finally finished that quote.

204
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:18,413
Tomoya, listen to this!

205
00:17:18,872 --> 00:17:19,706
What happened?

206
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:24,627
The new girl can't do her job
so I had to cover for her the whole time,

207
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:26,713
but Ms. Sumiyoshi is so easy on her.

208
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:29,424
She's only tough on me.

209
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:33,052
Just because I'm a contract employee,
she uses me as an outlet for her stress.

210
00:17:33,136 --> 00:17:33,970
Right?

211
00:17:35,263 --> 00:17:36,097
Uh... Uh-huh.

212
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,892
Poor Reina.

213
00:17:39,309 --> 00:17:41,936
Well, it's my job,
so I just have tough it out.

214
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:43,688
You're amazing, Reina.

215
00:17:44,272 --> 00:17:46,065
But you should speak up more, you know?

216
00:17:46,149 --> 00:17:47,567
You're too nice.

217
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:49,736
Thanks!

218
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:52,906
You and Misa really are
the only ones that understand me.

219
00:17:54,115 --> 00:17:55,074
I'm gonna eat.

220
00:17:56,493 --> 00:17:59,078
<i>How can I get these two</i>
<i>to marry each other?</i>

221
00:17:59,662 --> 00:18:03,750
<i>They get into an affair ten years later,</i>
<i>so it's not like there's zero chance now.</i>

222
00:18:10,173 --> 00:18:11,341
What's up?

223
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:13,259
Yeah, I'm having lunch.

224
00:18:13,968 --> 00:18:17,096
<i>-At this time, Reina had a fiancé.</i>
-I'm eating curry.

225
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:18,223
-It is.
-Seriously?

226
00:18:18,306 --> 00:18:19,349
Excuse me, one mega.

227
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:23,186
<i>He's a high-spec boyfriend</i>
<i>who works for an advertising agency.</i>

228
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:24,437
<i>And mine...</i>

229
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:29,067
<i>doesn't do housework, has no prospects,</i>

230
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:32,278
<i>and his self-esteem is only rivaled</i>
<i>by his reliance on his mother.</i>

231
00:18:33,196 --> 00:18:34,322
Oh, no... I can't win.

232
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:38,576
Oh, never mind! It's nothing.

233
00:18:40,078 --> 00:18:42,997
Oh, sorry, sorry.
I was talking over here. So, what's up?

234
00:18:43,081 --> 00:18:45,959
<i>But, hey, if he doesn't talk,</i>
<i>he's not bad to look at, right?</i>

235
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:48,670
<i>Please, Reina, notice Tomoya's charm!</i>

236
00:18:48,753 --> 00:18:50,296
Can you make time?

237
00:18:51,256 --> 00:18:52,674
I'm so happy!

238
00:18:52,757 --> 00:18:56,219
<i>He's nice when he's in a good mood,</i>
<i>and he's tough from playing rugby.</i>

239
00:18:56,553 --> 00:18:58,346
<i>You'd expect more out of a person,</i>

240
00:18:58,429 --> 00:19:02,600
<i>but if you think of him as a spoiled dog</i>
<i>who bites you if he doesn't get his way...</i>

241
00:19:03,226 --> 00:19:05,520
<i>Why did I marry a man like that?</i>

242
00:19:07,105 --> 00:19:08,064
Look, look.

243
00:19:10,567 --> 00:19:12,402
You're perfect together!

244
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:15,989
It's like you two were meant
for each other!

245
00:19:17,407 --> 00:19:18,533
<i>It's no good!</i>

246
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:21,911
<i>I knew it. She looks down on both of us.</i>

247
00:19:22,287 --> 00:19:25,665
Let's go out for drinks again
with your boyfriend, all four of us.

248
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:28,835
Oh, he's always so busy though.

249
00:19:28,918 --> 00:19:30,169
<i>Oh, yeah!</i>

250
00:19:30,253 --> 00:19:31,421
<i>There's still a chance.</i>

251
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:33,423
<i>The ad agency guy had another girlfriend.</i>

252
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:34,799
You bastard!

253
00:19:34,883 --> 00:19:35,717
Reina!

254
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,761
<i>After she found him cheating,</i>
<i>they argued for months,</i>

255
00:19:38,845 --> 00:19:41,264
<i>and Reina got dumped</i>
<i>just before Christmas.</i>

256
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:44,142
Gimme my time back!

257
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:47,937
<i>Soon, Reina and her boyfriend</i>
<i>will break up.</i>

258
00:19:48,021 --> 00:19:48,938
<i>That's my chance!</i>

259
00:20:02,076 --> 00:20:04,245
I'm so full!

260
00:20:05,163 --> 00:20:06,831
See you guys later!

261
00:20:09,459 --> 00:20:10,919
<i>Wait, what happens, again?</i>

262
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:16,633
<i>I remember now!</i>

263
00:20:16,716 --> 00:20:18,259
See you guys later!

264
00:20:24,807 --> 00:20:26,643
-I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
-Are you okay?

265
00:20:27,185 --> 00:20:29,187
-Oh, no!
-I wasn't paying attention either.

266
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:31,731
Oh, no, it was such a nice suit.
I'm so, so sorry!

267
00:20:31,814 --> 00:20:33,149
I'll bring something to wipe with!

268
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,360
-What a disaster.
-Yeah.

269
00:20:38,196 --> 00:20:39,280
<i>Now I know.</i>

270
00:20:40,323 --> 00:20:42,450
<i>She did that on purpose.</i>

271
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:45,870
-Oh, you're leaving already?
-Ms. Sumiyoshi!

272
00:20:52,877 --> 00:20:54,587
Hey! Seriously?

273
00:20:54,671 --> 00:20:56,130
Tomoya! I'm sorry!

274
00:20:56,214 --> 00:20:58,299
Oh, man, this is no joke.

275
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,885
I'm so sorry! Misa came so suddenly.

276
00:21:01,469 --> 00:21:03,096
Hirano, are you okay?

277
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:04,138
-Well...
-Are you okay?

278
00:21:04,222 --> 00:21:06,557
<i>So, whatever happens,</i>
<i>happens no matter what!</i>

279
00:21:06,641 --> 00:21:07,475
I'm so sorry!

280
00:21:07,976 --> 00:21:08,977
SUMIYOSHI

281
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,728
<i>But if there is a substitute...</i>

282
00:21:10,812 --> 00:21:11,854
TOMOYA

283
00:21:11,938 --> 00:21:13,690
This was so expensive.

284
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:14,983
I'm so sorry!

285
00:21:15,066 --> 00:21:16,901
-It's not coming off!
<i>-I can change my destiny!</i>

286
00:21:16,985 --> 00:21:18,820
-What can we do?
-Oh, I'm really...

287
00:21:18,903 --> 00:21:21,030
This sucks!

288
00:21:21,114 --> 00:21:23,408
This suit and shirt cost me a fortune!

289
00:21:23,491 --> 00:21:24,867
I'm sorry, Tomoya.

290
00:21:25,326 --> 00:21:26,703
Let me pay for it.

291
00:21:28,037 --> 00:21:29,163
No.

292
00:21:30,498 --> 00:21:31,666
It's okay.

293
00:21:31,749 --> 00:21:33,167
You didn't do it on purpose.

294
00:21:33,751 --> 00:21:35,336
I should wash it right away.

295
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:37,171
Or get it dry-cleaned.

296
00:21:37,714 --> 00:21:39,298
I wonder if it'll come out?

297
00:21:41,092 --> 00:21:41,926
Why?

298
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:43,928
What do you mean why?

299
00:21:44,971 --> 00:21:46,973
Why are you giving it to me?

300
00:21:47,056 --> 00:21:49,267
-Wash it, will you?
-It's your suit, right?

301
00:21:56,441 --> 00:21:57,275
Yes!

302
00:21:57,692 --> 00:22:00,403
<i>I said it! I told him</i>
<i>what I wanted to say!</i>

303
00:22:00,486 --> 00:22:02,947
<i>Oh, is this my first time?</i>
<i>It might be my first time!</i>

304
00:22:03,031 --> 00:22:05,491
I'm not the same as I was the first time!

305
00:22:21,466 --> 00:22:22,800
I can start over.

306
00:22:23,968 --> 00:22:26,512
I'm ten years younger now after all.

307
00:22:30,266 --> 00:22:31,517
Excuse me.

308
00:22:32,602 --> 00:22:33,436
Yes?

309
00:22:34,145 --> 00:22:34,979
Um...

310
00:22:36,814 --> 00:22:38,191
Oh, is something wrong?

311
00:22:38,816 --> 00:22:41,652
It's a bit of an emergency.

312
00:22:42,278 --> 00:22:43,988
Oh, do you mean...

313
00:22:44,405 --> 00:22:46,157
Yes. Exactly.

314
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,784
I'll bring some over!

315
00:22:49,952 --> 00:22:51,204
Thank you.

316
00:22:52,288 --> 00:22:55,083
I thought I'd never be able
to leave that stall.

317
00:22:55,166 --> 00:22:56,751
Don't worry about it.

318
00:22:56,834 --> 00:22:59,712
The restrooms on that floor
strangely don't get much traffic.

319
00:23:00,463 --> 00:23:04,133
I asked other people for help,
but they ignored me.

320
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:05,760
They ignored you?

321
00:23:05,843 --> 00:23:08,387
I heard someone on the phone
as she left the restroom.

322
00:23:09,013 --> 00:23:11,140
It was definitely Ms. Esaka.

323
00:23:12,767 --> 00:23:15,019
Yeah... Sorry.

324
00:23:16,104 --> 00:23:17,814
Why are you apologizing?

325
00:23:20,108 --> 00:23:23,361
I'm the type to always return the favor
when people mess with me,

326
00:23:23,444 --> 00:23:24,529
so I'll be fine.

327
00:23:26,948 --> 00:23:28,282
That goes for you, too.

328
00:23:29,117 --> 00:23:29,951
What?

329
00:23:30,034 --> 00:23:31,994
Consider me in your debt, Ms. Kanbe.

330
00:23:32,078 --> 00:23:34,413
I will definitely pay you back for this.

331
00:23:40,628 --> 00:23:41,546
{\an8}MAMEKAME-DOU

332
00:23:41,629 --> 00:23:43,297
{\an8}-This is good too.
-Hello.

333
00:23:43,381 --> 00:23:45,133
-Oh, welcome!
-Welcome!

334
00:23:46,175 --> 00:23:47,009
The usual?

335
00:23:47,093 --> 00:23:48,594
-Yes. The Mamekame set.
-Okay.

336
00:23:48,678 --> 00:23:50,721
-Help yourself to the second floor.
-Oh, thanks.

337
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:53,057
-I'll prepare it now. Okay.
-Thank you.

338
00:23:56,602 --> 00:23:57,979
Thank you for waiting.

339
00:23:58,062 --> 00:23:59,480
Thank you so much.

340
00:24:00,148 --> 00:24:01,440
Please take your time!

341
00:24:05,111 --> 00:24:06,279
Thank you for the food.

342
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:23,754
This always calms me down.

343
00:24:54,827 --> 00:24:55,661
Hello.

344
00:24:56,078 --> 00:24:56,913
Hello.

345
00:24:57,872 --> 00:25:00,416
I was rude to you the other day.

346
00:25:00,917 --> 00:25:02,126
The other day?

347
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:06,255
Oh, no, no,
I should be the one apologizing.

348
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:09,634
So you two are friends!

349
00:25:32,323 --> 00:25:33,616
Please enjoy.

350
00:25:39,705 --> 00:25:42,708
-May I?
-What? Oh, please! Sit down.

351
00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:52,551
-Um--
-Um--

352
00:25:54,053 --> 00:25:55,137
-Go ahead.
-Oh, no, go ahead.

353
00:25:55,221 --> 00:25:56,347
No, no, you first.

354
00:25:59,225 --> 00:26:01,143
Is your burn okay?

355
00:26:02,853 --> 00:26:04,522
It's no big deal.

356
00:26:05,898 --> 00:26:07,108
Do you come here often?

357
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:09,610
Yes, when I want to be alone.

358
00:26:12,238 --> 00:26:13,572
Oh, no! That's not what I meant!

359
00:26:14,365 --> 00:26:16,617
It's a place
my father took me in the past.

360
00:26:18,703 --> 00:26:19,787
Your father?

361
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:20,788
Yes.

362
00:26:21,122 --> 00:26:23,374
I can relax when I'm here.

363
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:25,793
What about you?

364
00:26:27,169 --> 00:26:28,879
I found it during my research.

365
00:26:30,006 --> 00:26:32,800
I sometimes organize
my market research findings here.

366
00:26:33,426 --> 00:26:34,552
Market research?

367
00:26:45,855 --> 00:26:47,565
[STORE] SATOICHI
[PRODUCT] IMAGAWAYAKI 540 YEN

368
00:26:47,648 --> 00:26:49,734
"Don't just study it,
see it for yourself."

369
00:26:49,817 --> 00:26:51,902
That's what my gra-- the chairman says.

370
00:26:52,737 --> 00:26:54,363
Your grandfather, right?

371
00:26:55,197 --> 00:26:57,366
-What...
-I heard it from a colleague today.

372
00:26:58,909 --> 00:27:00,036
I see.

373
00:27:04,248 --> 00:27:06,292
Did you know that
Suzutoya Holdings originated

374
00:27:06,834 --> 00:27:11,047
from the traditional
Japanese confectionery shop "Suzutoya"?

375
00:27:11,339 --> 00:27:12,173
Yes.

376
00:27:12,715 --> 00:27:16,344
My father loved
the sweet bean rice cakes from Suzutoya.

377
00:27:16,761 --> 00:27:18,721
The taste hasn't changed
since the beginning.

378
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:20,848
Unchanging taste...

379
00:27:22,099 --> 00:27:25,061
It's so comforting, isn't it?
The strawberry milk candy too.

380
00:27:27,521 --> 00:27:28,689
<i>Remember when you were a kid,</i>

381
00:27:28,773 --> 00:27:30,900
and you popped
a sweet candy into your mouth,

382
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:32,610
how easy it was to believe?

383
00:27:34,862 --> 00:27:38,407
Oh, I remember
the old Suzutoya commercial.

384
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:42,453
The boy that was dancing with Suzuto,
that was you, right?

385
00:27:43,412 --> 00:27:47,124
That... Where did you hear that from?

386
00:27:47,208 --> 00:27:48,417
My colleague.

387
00:27:49,126 --> 00:27:51,754
So nostalgic! I wonder
if we can still find that commercial?

388
00:27:51,837 --> 00:27:54,256
Please don't ever look it up.

389
00:27:56,175 --> 00:27:57,343
I'm not proud of it.

390
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:00,846
I'm sorry.

391
00:28:03,307 --> 00:28:06,102
Do you... Do you also know about "that"?

392
00:28:07,978 --> 00:28:08,813
"That"?

393
00:28:10,523 --> 00:28:13,984
What they call me behind my back...

394
00:28:17,905 --> 00:28:19,698
"Noble Son"?

395
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:28,624
I thought noble sons were only
in girls' manga or in Korean dramas,

396
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:30,084
but look, they actually exist!

397
00:28:30,751 --> 00:28:32,795
-Are you making fun of me?
-Oh, no!

398
00:28:32,878 --> 00:28:36,340
No. In a good way! In a good way!
Everyone was saying it in a good way.

399
00:28:36,424 --> 00:28:37,425
In a good way?

400
00:28:37,508 --> 00:28:39,718
I mean, a Noble Son is usually reserved,

401
00:28:39,802 --> 00:28:42,680
but comes to the rescue whenever
the heroine is in trouble, right?

402
00:28:42,763 --> 00:28:44,223
It's everyone's dream...

403
00:28:46,684 --> 00:28:48,352
Oh, and they all say that...

404
00:28:48,436 --> 00:28:50,688
You're amazing
at your job, Director Suzuki!

405
00:28:53,274 --> 00:28:55,276
The reason I'm in my position is...

406
00:28:57,945 --> 00:29:00,739
as I'm sure you're aware,
not because of my ability.

407
00:29:02,408 --> 00:29:03,242
But...

408
00:29:10,791 --> 00:29:14,253
You really like
Japanese sweets, don't you?

409
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:20,718
I love the sweet potato yokan here too.

410
00:29:25,681 --> 00:29:26,724
Here.

411
00:29:28,225 --> 00:29:29,643
Can I take a look?

412
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:31,395
Yes. Here.

413
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:36,025
GINZA KARIYA "THE KARIYA MATCHA"

414
00:29:36,108 --> 00:29:39,445
Compared to yours,
it's like a child's doodle.

415
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:45,826
In an age where we can feel like
we know everything by looking online,

416
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:48,871
you actually visit the stores
to experience things firsthand.

417
00:29:49,997 --> 00:29:53,167
The aroma, the texture,
the atmosphere inside the shop...

418
00:29:54,376 --> 00:29:58,839
The information you get
from your five senses is irreplaceable.

419
00:29:59,632 --> 00:30:05,095
I don't think
your way of working is wrong at all.

420
00:30:13,229 --> 00:30:14,146
But...

421
00:30:15,397 --> 00:30:19,485
for kintsuba<i>,</i>
I recommend Minato-an over Sakura-dou.

422
00:30:20,945 --> 00:30:22,947
Oh, I respectfully disagree!

423
00:30:23,447 --> 00:30:24,448
Director.

424
00:30:24,532 --> 00:30:26,742
Why is your review
of Kawata-ya's mitarashi-dango so low?

425
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:28,160
It's so delicious!

426
00:30:28,244 --> 00:30:29,995
The sauce is too strong.

427
00:30:30,079 --> 00:30:32,748
It would be more popular with the public
if it was a bit milder.

428
00:30:33,624 --> 00:30:34,583
Senzaki.

429
00:30:34,667 --> 00:30:35,668
There's no other choice.

430
00:30:35,751 --> 00:30:38,462
Well, the mitarashi-dango at Senzaki
is indeed good, but...

431
00:30:38,546 --> 00:30:39,797
Have you ever been?

432
00:30:40,464 --> 00:30:41,882
I have.

433
00:30:41,966 --> 00:30:44,134
-The main store is in Kyoto, right?
-Yes.

434
00:30:44,218 --> 00:30:46,345
But the Tokyo branch isn't half bad.

435
00:30:47,972 --> 00:30:49,974
Speaking of Kyoto,

436
00:30:50,057 --> 00:30:53,978
the Gion Senkyo collaboration cafe
is opening this week for a limited time.

437
00:30:54,061 --> 00:30:57,523
I wanted to go,
but I was so busy with work back then!

438
00:31:00,234 --> 00:31:04,446
Wait, back then? What am I saying...
I mean, I have to go for sure!

439
00:31:06,115 --> 00:31:08,659
17:00 REINA

440
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:11,870
<i>On this day...</i>

441
00:31:12,621 --> 00:31:14,415
Isn't this place amazing?

442
00:31:14,498 --> 00:31:17,167
Yeah, it's not every day
we have dinner at a hotel.

443
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:18,961
Hey, they're here!

444
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:21,005
Oh, Reina!

445
00:31:22,131 --> 00:31:23,757
Long time no see!

446
00:31:24,383 --> 00:31:26,093
Hey, why...

447
00:31:26,176 --> 00:31:28,512
Oh... It's our class reunion today.

448
00:31:28,596 --> 00:31:30,764
You wouldn't have come
if I'd told you, right?

449
00:31:32,808 --> 00:31:35,519
-Reina, it's been too long!
-Hey!

450
00:31:35,603 --> 00:31:38,689
Oh, I'm fine, I'm fine! How are you all?

451
00:31:44,361 --> 00:31:46,447
Reina, you work for Suzutoya?

452
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:47,906
Yeah, I switched companies.

453
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:49,700
Wow!

454
00:31:49,783 --> 00:31:50,618
Really?

455
00:31:50,701 --> 00:31:52,786
Reina, how's your boyfriend
from the ad agency?

456
00:31:53,412 --> 00:31:55,331
-Wait, what?
-No one told me!

457
00:31:55,497 --> 00:31:56,457
What, what, what?

458
00:31:56,540 --> 00:32:00,294
Well, soon enough, I might have some news
to announce to you all!

459
00:32:10,262 --> 00:32:12,514
Where did she go? That Kanbe.

460
00:32:12,598 --> 00:32:14,975
She slipped away before anyone noticed.

461
00:32:15,059 --> 00:32:17,770
She's always been so gloomy.

462
00:32:17,853 --> 00:32:20,064
Just having her around darkens the mood.

463
00:32:20,898 --> 00:32:24,109
Why is Reina friends with a girl like her?

464
00:32:24,193 --> 00:32:27,154
Well, you know, Reina is just too nice.

465
00:32:28,072 --> 00:32:30,991
I don't know how
Kanbe can even show her face here.

466
00:32:31,075 --> 00:32:32,951
She did such a horrible thing.

467
00:32:33,035 --> 00:32:34,828
-Yeah, I know, right?
-Yeah.

468
00:32:34,912 --> 00:32:37,122
Aren't we all getting
a little out of line here?

469
00:32:37,206 --> 00:32:38,749
-But it's true, isn't it?
-It is.

470
00:32:38,832 --> 00:32:40,668
She's got a thick skin, doesn't she?

471
00:32:46,632 --> 00:32:47,800
Misa!

472
00:32:49,802 --> 00:32:51,303
Are you really going home already?

473
00:32:52,054 --> 00:32:55,557
Sorry. I don't feel well... Sorry.

474
00:33:06,193 --> 00:33:07,361

This book is great, you should read it.

<i>I contacted you because something</i>

487
00:34:09,339 --> 00:34:12,092
<i>It's about a letter</i>
<i>given to me by Reina Esaka.</i>

488
00:34:12,176 --> 00:34:13,594
Yeah. Let me know what you think.

489
00:34:13,677 --> 00:34:16,430
<i>At the time,</i>
<i>I was shocked by what you said,</i>

490
00:34:16,513 --> 00:34:18,474
<i>but the more I thought</i>
<i>about it afterwards,</i>

491
00:34:18,557 --> 00:34:21,894
<i>the more I realized that there was no way</i>
<i>you would write such a letter.</i>

492
00:34:21,977 --> 00:34:23,729
{\an8}<i>Could we talk?</i>

493
00:34:23,812 --> 00:34:24,772
{\an8}Thanks!

494
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:27,900
A letter?

495
00:34:30,027 --> 00:34:32,112
Misa, let's go.

496
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,281
Yeah.

497
00:34:35,908 --> 00:34:36,742
Bye.

498
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:39,369
Bye, see you.

499
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:40,996
See you.

500
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:43,957
Sorry to keep you.

501
00:34:45,292 --> 00:34:46,543
What were you talking about?

502
00:34:47,044 --> 00:34:50,547
He asked me if I was interested
in joining the drama club.

503
00:34:50,964 --> 00:34:53,091
He showed me the script
for the next performance,

504
00:34:53,175 --> 00:34:54,510
and it's really interesting.

505
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:57,596
Misa, are you planning to go onstage?

506
00:34:58,722 --> 00:35:00,015
No, no.

507
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:03,143
I just thought it'd be nice
if I could help backstage.

508
00:35:03,227 --> 00:35:05,771
It doesn't suit you, Misa. Forget it.

509
00:35:06,688 --> 00:35:09,858
All the girls think Tanabe's creepy.

510
00:35:10,609 --> 00:35:12,110
If you hang around someone like that,

511
00:35:12,194 --> 00:35:15,405
people might start thinking
you're just like him, and that worries me.

512
00:35:19,034 --> 00:35:21,703
I don't know
anything about theater at all,

513
00:35:21,787 --> 00:35:23,413
but I thought it was great.

514
00:35:23,497 --> 00:35:25,749
Oh, that's great to hear. Thanks.

515
00:35:25,833 --> 00:35:27,751
Hey, can I get your number?

516
00:35:27,835 --> 00:35:28,961
Yeah. Of course.

517
00:35:31,255 --> 00:35:33,048
Yours is the only one I don't have.

518
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:34,341
-Oh really?
-Yeah.

519
00:35:34,842 --> 00:35:35,843
Yay!

520
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:38,178
Here.

521
00:35:38,262 --> 00:35:39,555
<i>That's when it started.</i>

522
00:35:42,015 --> 00:35:44,977
<i>That's when the whole class</i>
<i>started ignoring me.</i>

523
00:35:45,853 --> 00:35:47,020
Kanbe, all alone.

524
00:35:47,563 --> 00:35:50,524
-Stop that!
-Well.

525
00:35:51,567 --> 00:35:53,694
Eating all by herself.

526
00:35:54,069 --> 00:35:55,612
She can hear you.

-Yeah.

00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:17,885
I'm sorry!

530
00:36:17,968 --> 00:36:20,804
I bumped into you
on my way to open the window!

531
00:36:23,307 --> 00:36:25,058
Poor thing.

532
00:36:25,142 --> 00:36:27,644
Hey, Reina, you'll eat with us, right?

533
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:29,021
Yeah.

534
00:36:29,104 --> 00:36:30,022
Then, let's go.

535
00:36:31,607 --> 00:36:32,858
I'll take your chair.

536
00:36:35,986 --> 00:36:36,820
Reina.

537
00:36:38,488 --> 00:36:40,073
-Wow, your bento is so cute!
-Wow, cute!

538
00:36:40,157 --> 00:36:42,200
-Isn't it too small?
-Not really.

539
00:36:42,284 --> 00:36:45,454
-Doesn't look like it'll be enough.
-It's enough.

540
00:36:47,664 --> 00:36:50,167
Hey! Wait, wait, I want some too.

541
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:55,589
That's terrible.

542
00:37:16,318 --> 00:37:17,694
<i>Not that one.</i>

543
00:37:17,778 --> 00:37:19,613
That kind of thing doesn't suit you.

544
00:37:20,614 --> 00:37:22,574
Now, this is definitely the one for you.

545
00:37:24,785 --> 00:37:25,911
It'll look great on you!

546
00:37:36,505 --> 00:37:38,340
Hey, isn't this one great?

547
00:37:38,423 --> 00:37:40,592
It'll look so good in your place!

548
00:37:40,676 --> 00:37:42,219
<i>You have to get it!</i>

549
00:38:19,548 --> 00:38:21,133
That felt good.

550
00:38:28,557 --> 00:38:30,100
That's right. Today...

551
00:38:30,559 --> 00:38:35,939
The Gion Senkyo collaboration cafe
is opening this week for a limited time.

552
00:38:37,274 --> 00:38:38,150
All right.

553
00:38:38,233 --> 00:38:40,819
Today's gonna be my all-day food tour!

554
00:38:41,361 --> 00:38:44,281
I'm healthy now,
so why waste it not doing what I want!

555
00:38:51,872 --> 00:38:53,707
I have... nothing to wear.

556
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:58,170
<i>Today's weather in the Kanto region</i>
<i>is expected to be clear and sunny.</i>

557
00:38:58,962 --> 00:39:02,966
<i>With blue skies and a comfortable high</i>
<i>of around 22 degrees,</i>

558
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:05,343
<i>it's shaping up</i>
<i>to be a perfect day to be outside.</i>

559
00:39:05,427 --> 00:39:08,263
<i>-The sunlight may feel strong...</i>
-What do you think, Kamekichi?

560
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:12,392
<i>...so be sure to protect yourself</i>
<i>with a hat or sunscreen.</i>

561
00:39:12,476 --> 00:39:15,687
A man who comes running
to the rescue no matter where you are...

562
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,399
would be a stalker if he really existed.

563
00:39:22,152 --> 00:39:26,031
<i>In northern Japan and the Hokuriku region,</i>
<i>high pressure will bring clear skies.</i>

564
00:39:26,114 --> 00:39:29,159
<i>Western Japan is also likely to enjoy</i>
<i>mostly sunny conditions.</i>

565
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:32,913
<i>And in Okinawa, the abundant sunshine</i>

566
00:39:32,996 --> 00:39:35,999
<i>will make it a perfect day</i>
<i>for outdoor leisure.</i>

567
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:40,212
<i>With the dry and refreshing air,</i>
<i>it's an ideal day to go out--</i>

568
00:39:48,845 --> 00:39:51,014
JAPANESE SWEETS

569
00:39:52,307 --> 00:39:53,517
How many are in your party?

570
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,518
Two.

571
00:39:54,601 --> 00:39:56,061
Please wait a little longer.

572
00:39:56,144 --> 00:39:57,771
How many? One?

573
00:39:57,854 --> 00:40:00,774
Would it be all right
if we ask you to wait a little longer?

574
00:40:00,857 --> 00:40:02,400
I'll bring you a menu right away.

575
00:40:02,484 --> 00:40:04,402
-Sorry. Please wait.
-Thank you. Yes.

576
00:40:04,486 --> 00:40:06,738
-How many in your party?
-Just one.

577
00:40:06,822 --> 00:40:11,076
One person. I'm terribly sorry,
but we're currently full.

578
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:13,328
There will be about a 30-minute wait.

579
00:40:14,704 --> 00:40:15,789
Hello!

580
00:40:18,333 --> 00:40:19,584
If you'd like.

581
00:40:22,003 --> 00:40:24,631
You're here for research, right?

582
00:40:25,465 --> 00:40:27,467
Sorry, did I intrude?

583
00:40:27,926 --> 00:40:31,138
No, this is saving me time, so thank you.

584
00:40:32,764 --> 00:40:34,182
Oh, thank you.

585
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:43,316
Okay, I'm definitely getting
the matcha parfait,

586
00:40:44,192 --> 00:40:46,361
but there's also warabi-mochi,
nerikiri, and...

587
00:40:47,362 --> 00:40:48,572
I have to get dorayaki!

588
00:40:51,575 --> 00:40:52,951
They even have kimi-shigure!

589
00:40:54,077 --> 00:40:56,329
Oh, no, I can't choose...

590
00:40:58,290 --> 00:40:59,499
Do you want to share?

591
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:01,501
Share?

592
00:41:02,502 --> 00:41:06,131
We can both try more different kinds
that way, so it's more efficient.

593
00:41:32,115 --> 00:41:33,241
Thank you.

594
00:41:33,992 --> 00:41:35,619
-Here.
-Thank you.

595
00:41:57,891 --> 00:41:59,893
You like hojicha.

596
00:42:00,894 --> 00:42:02,062
Even at Mamekame-dou.

597
00:42:02,771 --> 00:42:03,688
Yes.

598
00:42:04,481 --> 00:42:05,690
It's very calming.

599
00:42:06,233 --> 00:42:08,193
People often say I'm too old-fashioned.

600
00:42:08,276 --> 00:42:09,611
Who would say that?

601
00:42:11,112 --> 00:42:13,490
Well... forget it.

602
00:42:15,408 --> 00:42:16,368
I like it too.

603
00:42:17,953 --> 00:42:19,788
Hojicha really is relaxing, isn't it?

604
00:42:23,166 --> 00:42:24,000
Yes.

605
00:42:31,967 --> 00:42:37,514
<i>At first, I thought he seemed cold,</i>
<i>but he's actually a really nice guy.</i>

606
00:42:41,309 --> 00:42:42,143
<i>Wait.</i>

607
00:42:42,602 --> 00:42:45,939
<i>Grandson of the chairman.</i>
<i>Good-looking. Good at his job.</i>

608
00:42:46,022 --> 00:42:51,736
<i>How often do you just happen to meet</i>
<i>someone straight out of a girls' manga?</i>

609
00:43:03,373 --> 00:43:04,291
Hello!

610
00:43:04,916 --> 00:43:05,917
If you'd like.

611
00:43:07,669 --> 00:43:09,379
<i>So many times in such a short period!</i>

612
00:43:11,006 --> 00:43:13,258
<i>Could it be on purpose?</i>

613
00:43:13,883 --> 00:43:15,135
<i>Am I being stalked?</i>

614
00:43:16,761 --> 00:43:18,096
<i>If I think about it,</i>

615
00:43:18,179 --> 00:43:20,682
<i>the comment from the other day</i>
<i>was quite excessive,</i>

616
00:43:21,057 --> 00:43:24,185
<i>and just like he said,</i>
<i>I'm terrible at judging people.</i>

617
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:27,397
<i>Reina, Tomoya...</i>
<i>I only attract the worst of the worst.</i>

618
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:28,648
<i>I'm a scumbag magnet.</i>

619
00:43:29,691 --> 00:43:32,527
<i>There's no way a decent person</i>
<i>would willingly get close to me.</i>

620
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:33,987
<i>Which means... this guy?</i>

621
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:36,990
<i>There's a very high chance</i>
<i>he's a massive scumbag!</i>

622
00:43:38,658 --> 00:43:40,452
<i>No wonder something felt off!</i>

623
00:43:40,535 --> 00:43:43,538
<i>I can't let myself be fooled.</i>
<i>I won't make the same mistake again.</i>

624
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:45,915
<i>Even Tomoya seemed kind at first!</i>

625
00:43:45,999 --> 00:43:48,335
<i>Behind the mask, is he actually a stalker?</i>

626
00:43:48,418 --> 00:43:50,837
<i>A bully? A manipulator?</i>
<i>A pervert? A psychopath?</i>

627
00:43:52,756 --> 00:43:53,923
Are you okay?

628
00:43:54,257 --> 00:43:55,091
No.

629
00:43:55,967 --> 00:43:56,801
What?

630
00:43:58,219 --> 00:43:59,846
Oh, never mind.

631
00:44:10,065 --> 00:44:11,191
<i>Okay, calm down.</i>

632
00:44:11,274 --> 00:44:14,152
<i>A noble son like him</i>
<i>can't be interested in someone like me.</i>

633
00:44:17,614 --> 00:44:18,782
What is it?

634
00:44:19,407 --> 00:44:20,867
Oh, no, nothing.

635
00:44:34,756 --> 00:44:36,257
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

636
00:44:38,343 --> 00:44:39,594
That was delicious.

637
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:40,512
Yes.

638
00:44:46,142 --> 00:44:46,976
So...

639
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:49,479
-Yes?
-What are your plans after this?

640
00:44:50,313 --> 00:44:51,981
I'm thinking about buying some clothes.

641
00:44:52,065 --> 00:44:53,024
Clothes?

642
00:44:53,942 --> 00:44:57,112
I went overboard cleaning and threw away
so much I ran out of clothes to--

643
00:44:57,195 --> 00:44:59,155
-The scarf!
-Excuse me?

644
00:44:59,572 --> 00:45:02,784
I made a rude remark the other day
about your scarf...

645
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:06,121
I threw away that scarf.

646
00:45:07,664 --> 00:45:10,417
I'm sorry.

647
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:12,252
No, no, it's not your fault.

648
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:13,670
If I could...

649
00:45:13,753 --> 00:45:14,587
Yes?

650
00:45:15,296 --> 00:45:17,424
As an apology, let me get you a new scarf.

651
00:45:17,507 --> 00:45:19,134
I know a good shop nearby.

652
00:45:20,885 --> 00:45:21,719
What?

653
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,722
KUHONBUTSUGAWA STREET

654
00:45:27,976 --> 00:45:29,436
It's right after this turn here.

655
00:45:29,519 --> 00:45:30,353
Yes.

656
00:45:39,904 --> 00:45:41,489
{\an8}NEW ARRIVAL
TOPS ¥39,800 - BOTTOMS ¥41,000

657
00:45:44,826 --> 00:45:45,827
Hey!

658
00:45:46,578 --> 00:45:48,288
Please, no expensive stores!

659
00:45:49,372 --> 00:45:51,291
It's a gift to apologize for what I said.

660
00:45:51,791 --> 00:45:52,625
No.

661
00:45:53,501 --> 00:45:55,336
I'll buy my own clothes.

662
00:45:57,338 --> 00:45:58,465
So cute.

663
00:46:05,722 --> 00:46:07,724
What? Secondhand clothes are this cheap?

664
00:46:08,433 --> 00:46:09,642
What, 500 yen?

665
00:46:09,726 --> 00:46:11,519
-Five hundred yen?
-Yes.

666
00:46:11,603 --> 00:46:12,645
No way...

667
00:46:12,729 --> 00:46:14,314
That's a surprise.

668
00:46:16,232 --> 00:46:18,651
It's my first time at a store like this.

669
00:46:18,735 --> 00:46:19,986
Do you come here often?

670
00:46:20,695 --> 00:46:23,990
A long time ago, I used to come
to stores like this with my mother.

671
00:46:24,073 --> 00:46:25,408
That's unexpected.

672
00:46:37,879 --> 00:46:40,548
That yellow sweater
would look so good on you!

673
00:46:41,591 --> 00:46:44,511
I don't know, I don't usually wear
bright colors like this.

674
00:46:44,594 --> 00:46:46,971
Oh, is that so? It looks perfect for you.

675
00:46:47,055 --> 00:46:48,223
Your boyfriend would agree.

676
00:46:49,057 --> 00:46:50,683
No! He's my boss!

677
00:46:50,767 --> 00:46:52,435
What? That's so funny.

678
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:03,279
Thanks to you,
I got a great deal on these clothes.

679
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:04,864
Good to hear.

680
00:47:33,101 --> 00:47:35,061
You know, shopping
is actually kind of fun.

681
00:47:36,104 --> 00:47:38,147
Was it not fun before?

682
00:47:39,983 --> 00:47:41,359
Well, yeah...

683
00:47:42,485 --> 00:47:44,487
When I cleaned out my room,

684
00:47:44,571 --> 00:47:48,741
I realized that I didn't have
a single outfit I actually liked.

685
00:47:49,909 --> 00:47:54,163
I guess I was always dressing
for someone else.

686
00:47:55,748 --> 00:47:59,502
It was just easier
not having to think for myself.

687
00:48:00,503 --> 00:48:03,590
But today,
I realized what a waste that was.

688
00:48:07,635 --> 00:48:09,053
You can start now.

689
00:48:09,554 --> 00:48:10,597
Anything.

690
00:48:12,515 --> 00:48:14,726
If you have regrets about something.

691
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:17,145
Regrets...

692
00:48:17,979 --> 00:48:23,192
Oh, in my first year of high school,
I really wanted to join the drama club.

693
00:48:24,277 --> 00:48:26,571
I said I just wanted to be backstage,

694
00:48:26,654 --> 00:48:27,572
but the truth is...

695
00:48:28,197 --> 00:48:29,782
Did you want to be onstage?

696
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:34,746
I wanted try being
a different version of myself.

697
00:48:37,081 --> 00:48:40,501
Anyway, there's no way
I could join the drama club now.

698
00:48:45,590 --> 00:48:47,133
REINA
DECLINE - ANSWER

699
00:48:52,889 --> 00:48:53,723
You're okay?

700
00:48:56,726 --> 00:48:59,354
Today, there's a class reunion.

701
00:48:59,771 --> 00:49:00,855
I'm not going though.

702
00:49:06,152 --> 00:49:07,528
Why aren't you going?

703
00:49:09,906 --> 00:49:12,659
They'll just say
bad things about me again.

704
00:49:15,036 --> 00:49:15,870
Again?

705
00:49:16,871 --> 00:49:17,872
Oh, no!

706
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:20,667
I went through high school
with no fond memories.

707
00:49:21,626 --> 00:49:26,673
It's not like I can change the past now,
or get my three years of high school back.

708
00:49:28,466 --> 00:49:32,345
Do you know what cactus spines are for?

709
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:35,264
Cactus spines?

710
00:49:36,224 --> 00:49:39,519
It's to protect themselves
from the raging sandstorms,

711
00:49:39,602 --> 00:49:43,231
the blazing sun, and all
the ravenous animals trying to eat them.

712
00:49:45,358 --> 00:49:48,736
Even in the brutally harsh conditions
of the desert, unable to move...

713
00:49:49,904 --> 00:49:51,322
they still fight...

714
00:49:51,823 --> 00:49:53,241
in their own way.

715
00:49:59,455 --> 00:50:02,667
You may have been helpless
as a first-year high school student,

716
00:50:04,502 --> 00:50:09,674
but perhaps now you have a thorn or two
to keep those who mean you harm at bay.

717
00:50:22,478 --> 00:50:24,272
A thorn, huh?

718
00:50:51,174 --> 00:50:52,008
Um...

719
00:50:54,635 --> 00:50:55,595
Here.

720
00:50:55,970 --> 00:50:57,430
Oh, let me pay for it.

721
00:50:57,513 --> 00:50:59,265
Oh, no, it's on me.

722
00:51:00,141 --> 00:51:01,267
Please take it.

723
00:51:03,603 --> 00:51:05,188
Thank you.

724
00:51:16,741 --> 00:51:18,493
Sorry to keep you waiting!

725
00:51:20,995 --> 00:51:24,665
Sorry for the sudden invitation!
I wanted to thank you for the other day.

726
00:51:24,749 --> 00:51:26,501
I was happy you invited me.

727
00:51:28,336 --> 00:51:29,420
Is he your boyfriend?

728
00:51:29,504 --> 00:51:30,463
No, I'm not.

729
00:51:30,546 --> 00:51:33,049
-Oh, but you guys look great together.
-I'm not.

730
00:51:34,133 --> 00:51:37,011
If I'm interrupting your date,
maybe I should leave?

731
00:51:37,094 --> 00:51:38,638
I'm about to leave myself.

732
00:51:38,721 --> 00:51:41,599
So, I guess
this is where I pass the baton.

733
00:51:48,272 --> 00:51:49,273
I think it'd suit you.

734
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:53,820
That dress from earlier.

735
00:51:59,283 --> 00:52:00,952
"That dress"?

736
00:52:15,299 --> 00:52:16,425
Ms. Kanbe.

737
00:52:16,509 --> 00:52:19,303
If it's love at first sight,
follow your heart.

738
00:52:27,562 --> 00:52:32,400
Ms. Kanbe, the money we earn
is meant for spending.

739
00:52:34,944 --> 00:52:37,405
The reason I married a boring,
dull girl like you

740
00:52:37,488 --> 00:52:40,157
is because you're a stingy woman
who saves money.

741
00:52:42,827 --> 00:52:44,120
You're right.

742
00:52:44,912 --> 00:52:45,830
I'm getting it!

743
00:52:47,999 --> 00:52:51,502
-Excuse me. I'd like to buy this!
-Right away!

744
00:52:55,381 --> 00:52:56,966
You really bought it!

745
00:52:57,592 --> 00:52:59,093
-Which is better?
-It's pretty.

746
00:52:59,719 --> 00:53:01,345
How about this, which do you like better?

747
00:53:04,056 --> 00:53:05,349
-This one!
-This one?

748
00:53:05,433 --> 00:53:07,059
Okay, then I'll get this one.

749
00:53:08,352 --> 00:53:09,604
So cute!

750
00:53:09,687 --> 00:53:12,023
-I think it looks great on you. Yes.
-Really?

751
00:53:15,192 --> 00:53:19,906
I... never thought you were someone
who could smile like that, Miku.

752
00:53:21,949 --> 00:53:26,162
We've been working together all this time,
and I never even tried to get to know you.

753
00:53:26,662 --> 00:53:27,914
I'm sorry.

754
00:53:31,292 --> 00:53:35,212
I wanted to talk with you more,

755
00:53:36,088 --> 00:53:38,758
but since Reina is always so close to you,

756
00:53:38,841 --> 00:53:40,968
I kind of shied away.

757
00:53:43,596 --> 00:53:44,972
-Reina!
-Reina! Good to see you.

758
00:53:45,056 --> 00:53:50,061
<i>I mean, Reina is all the worst things</i>
<i>about women concentrated in one tiny cup,</i>

759
00:53:50,144 --> 00:53:52,355
<i>like an espresso. You know what I mean?</i>

760
00:53:54,649 --> 00:53:58,569
I thought anyone
who was best friends with someone like her

761
00:53:58,653 --> 00:54:01,989
must be kind of messed up too.

762
00:54:02,865 --> 00:54:05,201
-Sorry.
-No. You're right.

763
00:54:10,915 --> 00:54:12,291
REINA
DECLINE - ANSWER

764
00:54:17,505 --> 00:54:18,339
But...

765
00:54:21,425 --> 00:54:23,219
I'm gonna end it.

766
00:54:29,308 --> 00:54:30,142
Hey.

767
00:54:30,226 --> 00:54:31,060
Hey.

768
00:54:32,895 --> 00:54:34,730
Leave it to him.

769
00:54:34,814 --> 00:54:36,232
He's an amazing hairdresser.

770
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:40,111
This is going to be fun.

771
00:54:44,573 --> 00:54:46,742
Is it true that Kanbe is coming today too?

772
00:54:47,284 --> 00:54:49,996
Yeah. But I can't get in touch with her.

773
00:54:50,496 --> 00:54:52,289
Misa tends to go at her own pace.

774
00:54:52,832 --> 00:54:55,918
Reina, you're a real softy, aren't you?

775
00:54:56,419 --> 00:54:58,587
Even though she did
such a horrible thing to you.

776
00:54:58,963 --> 00:55:01,924
Don't mention that in front of Misa, okay?

777
00:55:02,341 --> 00:55:04,427
I don't even think about it anymore.

778
00:55:04,927 --> 00:55:07,054
Does everyone have their glass?
Let's make a toast.

779
00:55:07,388 --> 00:55:08,639
Cheers!

780
00:55:08,723 --> 00:55:11,142
Cheers!

781
00:55:22,653 --> 00:55:24,280
<i>The stage is set.</i>

782
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:44,675
<i>I won't be running away this time.</i>

783
00:55:46,177 --> 00:55:47,386
<i>This stage...</i>

784
00:55:48,846 --> 00:55:49,930
<i>is mine.</i>

785
00:55:53,184 --> 00:55:54,351
Reina, forget it.

786
00:55:54,435 --> 00:55:57,438
Anyone who bails last minute like that
isn't worth your time.

787
00:55:57,855 --> 00:56:00,274
No one wants to see her
in the first place.

788
00:56:00,357 --> 00:56:02,318
I mean, just seeing that face
is such a buzzkill.

789
00:56:02,401 --> 00:56:03,360
-Yeah, so true!
-Yeah!

790
00:56:16,665 --> 00:56:18,501
I'm sorry I'm late.

791
00:56:18,959 --> 00:56:20,795
Thanks for inviting me today.

792
00:56:22,129 --> 00:56:23,172
Kanbe?

793
00:56:24,381 --> 00:56:26,759
Oh, sorry. I interrupted you.

794
00:56:26,842 --> 00:56:29,428
I know you're bad-mouthing me.
Feel free to continue.

795
00:56:31,722 --> 00:56:34,558
That outfit is too desperate.

796
00:56:35,226 --> 00:56:37,311
What are you trying to show off? Lame!

797
00:56:37,394 --> 00:56:41,107
Your bad personality hasn't changed.

798
00:56:42,066 --> 00:56:43,359
I came to ask you...

799
00:56:44,568 --> 00:56:46,695
something that's
bothered me all this time.

800
00:56:47,613 --> 00:56:48,697
Why...

801
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:53,702
did everyone just decide to hate me?

802
00:56:54,745 --> 00:56:57,623
The reason why we don't like you?

803
00:56:58,290 --> 00:56:59,625
It's your own fault.

804
00:57:00,584 --> 00:57:01,627
My fault?

805
00:57:02,211 --> 00:57:05,798
-Come on, stop it.
-Kanbe, you liked Yuto, didn't you?

806
00:57:06,549 --> 00:57:11,387
But when he started liking Reina,
you started harassing her behind her back,

807
00:57:11,470 --> 00:57:12,972
and everyone knows it.

808
00:57:13,514 --> 00:57:14,348
Harassing?

809
00:57:14,431 --> 00:57:17,226
Ignoring her,
writing bad things about her online,

810
00:57:17,309 --> 00:57:18,936
and throwing away her textbooks.

811
00:57:22,106 --> 00:57:23,440
I see...

812
00:57:26,694 --> 00:57:28,362
Who told you that?

813
00:57:28,737 --> 00:57:31,740
No point trying to cover it up.
I heard it straight from Reina.

814
00:57:31,824 --> 00:57:33,576
We're all witnesses.

815
00:57:33,659 --> 00:57:37,872
She was crying in front of us, saying that
she'd been holding it in for a long time.

816
00:57:38,664 --> 00:57:39,498
I see.

817
00:57:39,874 --> 00:57:41,041
And you...

818
00:57:41,125 --> 00:57:43,460
You sent Yuto
that creepy letter, didn't you?

819
00:57:43,544 --> 00:57:45,212
Saying, "If you keep stalking me,

820
00:57:45,296 --> 00:57:48,007
I'll report you
to the school and the police."

821
00:57:48,924 --> 00:57:49,925
That's messed up.

822
00:57:50,926 --> 00:57:53,387
I didn't write a letter to Tanabe.

823
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:55,014
I also never harassed Reina.

824
00:57:55,097 --> 00:57:56,974
-Don't lie!
-Just stop!

825
00:58:00,769 --> 00:58:04,398
It was ten years ago,
can't we just let it go?

826
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:09,111
If Misa says she didn't do it,
then she didn't.

827
00:58:09,195 --> 00:58:10,988
Isn't that enough?

828
00:58:11,780 --> 00:58:14,158
We finally got together
after all this time,

829
00:58:14,241 --> 00:58:16,076
so let's all have a good time today.

830
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:17,828
Okay, that's it, that's it!

831
00:58:17,912 --> 00:58:19,038
Let's drink, yeah?

832
00:58:19,121 --> 00:58:20,247
We can't let it go!

833
00:58:20,331 --> 00:58:22,166
Kanbe's the one who made a scene.

834
00:58:22,249 --> 00:58:24,210
Reina, you should tell her to her face.

835
00:58:24,293 --> 00:58:26,378
It's okay. Please.

836
00:58:27,171 --> 00:58:28,339
Reina.

837
00:58:30,925 --> 00:58:32,134
Why don't you stop this?

838
00:58:34,136 --> 00:58:35,095
What?

839
00:58:35,179 --> 00:58:36,722
Playing the good girl.

840
00:58:36,805 --> 00:58:38,057
Playing the victim.

841
00:58:39,975 --> 00:58:42,144
Hey, let's get out of here.

842
00:58:42,228 --> 00:58:43,896
She makes me sick.

843
00:58:43,979 --> 00:58:45,105
This is horrible.

844
00:58:46,148 --> 00:58:48,609
Is it fun crashing the class reunion?

845
00:58:48,692 --> 00:58:49,777
-Hey.
-Come on, Reina.

846
00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:51,362
-Let's go have fun somewhere else.
-Yeah.

847
00:58:51,445 --> 00:58:55,991
I'm all for enjoying the night,
but let me just say one thing.

848
00:58:59,328 --> 00:59:04,458
Never once in my life
have I had feelings for Esaka.

849
00:59:09,838 --> 00:59:10,881
Kanbe...

850
00:59:12,424 --> 00:59:17,846
I'm really sorry
I couldn't believe you at that time.

851
00:59:24,228 --> 00:59:25,396
I...

852
00:59:27,898 --> 00:59:29,066
I just...

853
00:59:30,859 --> 00:59:34,196
Back in high school, there was something
I always wanted to ask.

854
00:59:36,907 --> 00:59:38,575
What did I do?

855
00:59:39,994 --> 00:59:42,162
What did I do that made everyone hate me?

856
00:59:44,873 --> 00:59:46,375
But I couldn't ask.

857
00:59:47,626 --> 00:59:50,087
Because I kept thinking
it must've been my fault.

858
00:59:55,718 --> 00:59:57,136
But now?

859
00:59:57,219 --> 00:59:59,763
I just want to give my high school self
a big pat on the back

860
00:59:59,847 --> 01:00:01,473
for not hanging out with people like you.

861
01:00:01,890 --> 01:00:04,018
People who can't do anything on their own,

862
01:00:04,101 --> 01:00:06,729
who only know how to gang up
and tear others down.

863
01:00:06,812 --> 01:00:09,023
I'm so glad I wasn't friends
with people like that!

864
01:00:14,987 --> 01:00:16,071
Reina...

865
01:00:17,823 --> 01:00:18,991
I don't need you.

866
01:00:19,908 --> 01:00:22,619
I don't want friends
who don't care about hurting others.

867
01:00:23,787 --> 01:00:25,539
People who take pleasure
in someone else's pain,

868
01:00:25,622 --> 01:00:26,582
those aren't friends.

869
01:00:28,459 --> 01:00:29,877
So no. I don't need that.

870
01:00:30,878 --> 01:00:32,421
Because I know that from today on,

871
01:00:33,464 --> 01:00:36,133
I can make as many new friends as I want.

872
01:01:13,212 --> 01:01:14,296
Why?

873
01:01:15,881 --> 01:01:18,342
Why do you keep showing up
everywhere like this?

874
01:01:19,551 --> 01:01:22,262
I'm not the stalker or noble son
you might think I am, but...

875
01:01:34,233 --> 01:01:36,527
I can at least put an umbrella over you.

876
01:02:10,978 --> 01:02:12,187
<i>I think it'd suit you.</i>

877
01:02:14,815 --> 01:02:16,442
That dress from earlier.

878
01:02:44,136 --> 01:02:46,180
Don't look at me like that.

879
01:02:48,098 --> 01:02:50,350
I know I went too far.

880
01:02:52,436 --> 01:02:54,062
Went too far doing what?

881
01:02:55,397 --> 01:02:56,773
You came over?

882
01:02:58,150 --> 01:03:00,152
Welcome home. I want some tea.

883
01:03:01,737 --> 01:03:02,905
Is hojicha okay?

884
01:03:04,072 --> 01:03:06,200
No way. Too old-fashioned.

885
01:03:43,487 --> 01:03:44,530
Yes.

886
01:03:49,952 --> 01:03:50,953
Good morning.

887
01:03:51,495 --> 01:03:52,829
We need to talk.

888
01:03:54,122 --> 01:03:55,374
I'm breaking up with you.

889
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:58,293
Don't "huh" me.

890
01:03:58,377 --> 01:04:00,295
You've got another woman, right?

891
01:04:00,879 --> 01:04:03,048
She called me, by the way.

892
01:04:04,591 --> 01:04:06,677
And I've got all the proof I need.

893
01:04:07,261 --> 01:04:09,930
So is this... marriage fraud, isn't it?

894
01:04:10,013 --> 01:04:11,306
Breach of engagement?

895
01:04:11,807 --> 01:04:15,894
Whatever it is, just be ready
to cough up a nice, fat settlement.

896
01:04:16,562 --> 01:04:20,232
Oh, and don't worry about me.

897
01:04:20,315 --> 01:04:23,402
I was thinking
of letting you swim a little longer,

898
01:04:23,485 --> 01:04:28,365
but turns out, I've already found someone
way better than you.

899
01:04:29,283 --> 01:04:30,367
Bye-bye!

900
01:04:41,044 --> 01:04:42,671
Oh, I'm sorry!
