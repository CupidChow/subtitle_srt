Life is a script woven with beautiful scenes

00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:46,130
This is for you

3
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:10,696
So scary

4
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:12,364
-Right?
- So high

5
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:16,410
It’s super high. Are we at the highest point now?

6
00:01:16,494 --> 00:01:17,328
Yes

7
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:19,413
It’s the highest point. Can we take a picture?

8
00:01:19,497 --> 00:01:20,539
OK

00:01:20,623 --> 00:01:22,124

- Smile

10
00:01:23,751 --> 00:01:25,586
I hope I didn't get cut off.

11
00:01:25,669 --> 00:01:26,629
Please

12
00:01:26,712 --> 00:01:27,588
I have no idea

13
00:01:28,339 --> 00:01:31,342
- Very good
-marvelous

14
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:32,802
- You're so shiny
-Really?

15
00:01:32,885 --> 00:01:33,803
So cute

16
00:01:33,886 --> 00:01:35,554
-It suits you very well
- I'm so scared

17
00:01:35,638 --> 00:01:36,597
So scary!

18
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,183
- You're too harsh.
- It won't suit you.

19
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:40,100
Very cute

20
00:01:41,185 --> 00:01:43,270
- Very pretty and cute
-Really?

21
00:01:46,899 --> 00:01:48,984
Please come here, everyone.

22
00:01:49,068 --> 00:01:52,530
This is the former mascot, the bell rabbit.

23
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:53,614
Does anybody know it?

24
00:01:54,198 --> 00:01:56,408
-Everyone knows this, right?
-Of course.

25
00:01:57,535 --> 00:02:01,205
Then this is the latest version of Bell Rabbit

26
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:03,123
Now, please look over here.

27
00:02:03,207 --> 00:02:04,875
Sorry for the long wait

28
00:02:05,793 --> 00:02:06,710
It's so delicious!

29
00:02:07,211 --> 00:02:08,045
Very good

30
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:09,505
It's really delicious

31
00:02:11,757 --> 00:02:13,384
-Um
- One more

32
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:14,760
- Another one?
-right

33
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:37,616
Great! Thank you Misa!

34
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:42,079
I had many happy moments

35
00:02:43,205 --> 00:02:46,417
My life isn't that bad.

36
00:02:49,628 --> 00:02:50,546
Ms. Hirano

37
00:02:51,589 --> 00:02:52,590
Ms. Hirano

38
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:57,177
Don’t you have an appetite today?

39
00:02:58,804 --> 00:02:59,930
Excuse me

40
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:10,691

00:03:46,018 --> 00:03:47,186
Misa

43
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:49,980
How are you feeling?

44
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:52,691
fine

45
00:03:52,775 --> 00:03:54,860
I think you can eat this.

46
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:56,820
(Muscat jelly)

47
00:03:56,904 --> 00:03:57,905
Look

48
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:01,992
How are you?

49
00:04:03,994 --> 00:04:06,914
I can bring you whatever you want to eat.

50
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:11,043
Hot ramen and dumplings

51
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:14,004
I'm kidding.

52
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:16,090
Really

53
00:04:16,966 --> 00:04:18,926
What are you doing today?

54
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:21,929
I…

55
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:27,726
Lucky rope?

56
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:31,605
The old lady in my ward gave me some embroidery thread

57
00:04:31,689 --> 00:04:34,108
I miss you so much

58
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:39,446
do you remember?

59
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:43,117
The lucky string of love you gave me

60
00:04:45,244 --> 00:04:47,246
How could I forget?

61
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:52,334
Thanks to the lucky rope we became friends

62
00:04:55,713 --> 00:04:58,132
Wait, I'm almost done.

63
00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:08,308
Friends...

64
00:05:10,019 --> 00:05:11,603
Has he visited you recently?

65
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:18,485
So that's it

66
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:23,824
But he had just founded the company

67
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:26,410
Probably busy.

68
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:28,954
He doesn't want you to worry.
So one person is working hard

69
00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:32,833
How about you, Reina? Is your work going well?

70
00:05:33,584 --> 00:05:35,377
Not smooth at all

71
00:05:35,461 --> 00:05:37,880
The people above and below are very willful and reckless.

72
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:41,675
Our company is in chaos without you.

73
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:46,305
Finished

74
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:49,433
-Hands out
-good

75
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:59,276
I can finally repay you.

76
00:06:07,201 --> 00:06:08,535
Lucky rope

77
00:06:10,329 --> 00:06:13,707
If it breaks naturally, the wish will come true, right?

78
00:06:15,084 --> 00:06:16,043
right

79
00:06:19,505 --> 00:06:21,256
I hope my wish will come true soon.

80
00:06:28,347 --> 00:06:32,309
Misa, I hope you get better.

81
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:51,078
I'll see you again soon

82
00:07:04,258 --> 00:07:07,761
Grandma, I'm Misa, how are you?

83
00:07:07,845 --> 00:07:08,679
(Beautiful yarn)

84
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:11,390
Ms. Kikue, your granddaughter is saying hello to you.

85
00:07:12,391 --> 00:07:16,228
Grandma, the weather is very good here.

86
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:20,190
I'll call you next time

87
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:30,325
You said you were from Toyama, right?

88
00:07:31,493 --> 00:07:32,786
Where are your parents?

89
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:38,709
My dad passed away when I was in college.

90
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:43,172
My mother ran away from home when I was a child

91
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:47,092
I heard she died of the same disease as me.

92
00:07:47,718 --> 00:07:48,635
So that's it

93
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:53,849
Actually, there is a good thing today.

94
00:08:00,898 --> 00:08:01,815
Oh no

95
00:08:02,733 --> 00:08:04,693
I'm going to meet someone very important.

96
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:07,279
(Application for permission to stay outside the home)

97
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:29,259
The weather is great

98
00:08:32,471 --> 00:08:35,974
(Hainai Hospital)

99
00:08:36,058 --> 00:08:39,770

100
00:08:53,909 --> 00:08:55,035
(Incoming call)

101
00:08:58,372 --> 00:08:59,581
Hello?

102
00:08:59,665 --> 00:09:01,833
I am Miyata from Tokyo Mirai Life Insurance.

103
00:09:01,917 --> 00:09:04,211
I'm calling today to discuss the matter you asked me about earlier.

104
00:09:05,212 --> 00:09:06,046
yes

105
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:10,926
My grandmother is the beneficiary of my life insurance

106
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:13,053
But she has dementia and cannot file a claim

107
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:14,596
So I want to appoint an agent.

108
00:09:15,097 --> 00:09:17,808
Your life insurance beneficiary was changed three months ago

109
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:21,979
From your grandmother to your husband Hirano Tomoya

110
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:24,147
What?

111
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:49,423
(No taxis nearby)

112
00:10:29,046 --> 00:10:30,255
Please get in the car

113
00:10:47,898 --> 00:10:48,899
Are you okay?

114
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:52,110
fine

115
00:10:54,946 --> 00:10:56,823
Fortunately, I got you a ride.

116
00:10:57,949 --> 00:10:59,451
This is fate

117
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:02,454
Are you in a hurry?

118
00:11:02,954 --> 00:11:03,789
Yes

119
00:11:04,373 --> 00:11:06,875
I know a great route for you.

120
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:08,919
Sorry for bothering you

121
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:10,879
You're welcome.

122
00:11:13,715 --> 00:11:16,843
Are you from Toyama?

123
00:11:17,511 --> 00:11:18,595
You are awesome

124
00:11:19,096 --> 00:11:20,430
Is my accent that strong?

125
00:11:20,514 --> 00:11:22,015
No

126
00:11:22,099 --> 00:11:24,184
I am also from Toyama

127
00:11:24,267 --> 00:11:26,937
What a coincidence!

128
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:31,983
My dad used to be a taxi driver.

129
00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:36,029
The way you talk is very similar to him.
So it makes me miss it

130
00:11:36,113 --> 00:11:37,864
So that's how it is

131
00:11:39,408 --> 00:11:44,037
You came all the way from Toyama to such a far place.

132
00:11:44,121 --> 00:11:45,455
yes

133
00:11:47,124 --> 00:11:49,209
Miss, look

134
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:51,503
The scenery outside is beautiful

135
00:11:59,553 --> 00:12:02,055
But it’s not the maple leaf season yet.

136
00:12:03,974 --> 00:12:06,560
Let's just say I know a great route

137
00:12:07,144 --> 00:12:09,980
Good job.

138
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:40,510
As long as you want to go
No matter where you go, you can go

139
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:45,432
You will definitely meet...

140
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:49,686
Someone who truly cherishes you

141
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:36,149
Miss

142
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:39,152
Miss

143
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:40,904
arrive

144
00:13:41,363 --> 00:13:43,406
Sorry, I think I fell asleep.

145
00:13:44,616 --> 00:13:46,159
Can I pay by credit card?

146
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:48,495
No

147
00:13:50,121 --> 00:13:53,124
To be honest, you are my last passenger.

148
00:13:53,959 --> 00:13:56,962
Today is my last day as a driver.

149
00:13:57,671 --> 00:13:58,505
But…

150
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:00,382
Come on, stretch out your hand

151
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:04,719
Three o'clock snack

152
00:14:11,142 --> 00:14:12,018
Be careful on the road

153
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,897
Thanks

154
00:15:07,365 --> 00:15:08,199
I'm back

155
00:15:13,204 --> 00:15:14,748
Where are you moving to?

156
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:19,002
Move to where you like

157
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:23,882
My apartment's lease renewal date is coming up soon.

158
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:26,426
What did the doctor say?

159
00:15:28,011 --> 00:15:31,890
When I asked the doctor
He told me it would take at least three months

160
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:35,602
Up to six months

161
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:39,022
If a miracle happens, it will be twelve months

162
00:15:40,357 --> 00:15:42,275
What kind of algorithm is this?

163
00:15:42,359 --> 00:15:44,027
Pretty casual, right?

164
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:49,240
You can get the money by early next year at the latest.

165
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:52,077
Everything will go well.

166
00:15:53,328 --> 00:15:54,704
Really?

167
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:57,290
You are here again

168
00:15:57,707 --> 00:15:59,292
Have some confidence in me?

169
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,846
What are you talking about?

170
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:16,851
Will I get the money early next year?

171
00:16:17,435 --> 00:16:18,770
What money?

172
00:16:21,356 --> 00:16:22,273
Sorry Misa

173
00:16:24,401 --> 00:16:28,780
My friends and I are afraid of losing you

174
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:33,159
We are both lonely and can only rely on each other

175
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:44,003
Lina and I are both sick because of you.
Being forced to be unbearable

176
00:16:44,087 --> 00:16:47,507
That's why I lose my mind
Our mental state is not normal

177
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:52,887
When did it start?

178
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,727
-About half a year...
-One month

179
00:17:04,107 --> 00:17:08,069
Can't you just wait until I leave before starting?

180
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,114
I'm still alive

181
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,035
You said that the money you will receive at the beginning of the year

182
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:20,707
Is this my life insurance claim?

183
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:24,127
I heard from the insurance company.

184
00:17:24,753 --> 00:17:27,547
The compensation that was supposed to be received by my grandmother

185
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:29,716
The beneficiary becomes you

186
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:31,509
What did you tell the insurance company?

187
00:17:32,886 --> 00:17:34,554
You didn't say too much, did you?

188
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:37,515
Too talkative?

189
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:39,434
My mom took care of everything.

190
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:41,352
Don't ruin this.

191
00:17:41,436 --> 00:17:43,730
My mother might even be fired by the insurance company.

192
00:17:46,107 --> 00:17:48,651
It turns out you and your mother teamed up

193
00:17:49,527 --> 00:17:52,906
If I didn't have my compensation
My grandma can't live in a nursing home...

194
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:55,450
She's just the mother of your useless mother.

195
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:59,996
Why leave money to an unrelated old lady?

196
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,164
My grandmother only has me...

197
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:02,123
What about me?

198
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:07,045
You know I'm short of money.
But you abandon me so easily?

199
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:11,549
It's the end.
Can't you think about how someone who's been abandoned feels?

200
00:18:14,385 --> 00:18:16,638
Why do you think I married you?

201
00:18:17,931 --> 00:18:20,350
The reason why I'm like you
An inconspicuous and boring woman gets married

202
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:22,894
It's because you are stingy and save money.

203
00:18:22,977 --> 00:18:25,146
I married a woman like you who no one wants

204
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:27,524
In the end, you repay me with hatred.

205
00:18:28,191 --> 00:18:32,320
It's all because I married you
My life has become so bad.

206
00:18:32,403 --> 00:18:35,114

207
00:18:41,329 --> 00:18:43,540

208

209

I don't want to see you anymore

210
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:53,508
Are you going to end our relationship with words like this?

211
00:18:53,591 --> 00:18:54,843
Of course.

212
00:18:55,885 --> 00:19:00,223
How can you trample on other people's feelings like this?

213
00:19:06,062 --> 00:19:08,022
You're still the same in the end.

214
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:10,316
What?

215
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,194
She looks like a good girl and a victim.

216
00:19:14,863 --> 00:19:19,868
Misa, you keep saying that your friends don't come to visit you.

217
00:19:19,951 --> 00:19:21,452
Not even paying for hospitalization

218
00:19:21,536 --> 00:19:24,539
You kept complaining and made me think you didn't want him anymore

219
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:32,171
You can't make friends
I'm the only one who's always by your side, right?

220
00:19:32,589 --> 00:19:35,091
I'll go visit you and accompany you for the checkup.

221
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:36,259
I still hear you complain about your anxiety

222
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:38,052
I've paid so much for you

223
00:19:38,136 --> 00:19:40,513
You just made a mistake
Do you think I'm a bad person?

224
00:19:40,597 --> 00:19:44,684
How can you do such a thing as a friend?

225
00:19:55,528 --> 00:20:00,116
My feelings towards Youya are also complicated.

226
00:20:00,909 --> 00:20:02,327
You don't know at all?

227
00:20:03,578 --> 00:20:06,414
The reason why I have always hated you...

228
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,878
Anyway, it's the end, I'll tell you

229
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:18,051
I have disliked you since I was a child

230
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:20,845
We have never been friends

232
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:43,159

00:36:03,495 --> 00:36:05,038
I'm so sorry I'm late!

375
00:36:07,124 --> 00:36:10,085
I am Suzutoya Holdings
Kobe, Planning Department No. 2

376
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:13,714
Thank you for giving us this opportunity

377
00:36:17,134 --> 00:36:20,178
I was flustered and nervous
The entire briefing was a disaster.

378
00:36:20,846 --> 00:36:21,680
Oops

379
00:36:36,403 --> 00:36:38,822
I am Suzutoya Holdings
Kobe, Planning Department No. 2

380
00:36:38,906 --> 00:36:40,198
(Visitor Card 0079)

381
00:36:43,952 --> 00:36:45,329
Excuse me

382
00:37:00,802 --> 00:37:02,012
sorry

383
00:37:07,309 --> 00:37:10,270
That scarf doesn't suit you.

384
00:37:13,023 --> 00:37:15,275
Are you from Suzutoya Holdings?

385
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:16,193
Yes

386
00:37:16,777 --> 00:37:19,112
I'm Kobe from the Second Planning Department.

387
00:37:19,196 --> 00:37:20,614
Are you an employee of Ishii?

388
00:37:20,697 --> 00:37:25,452
No, I am Suzutoya Holdings
Suzuki

389
00:37:27,829 --> 00:37:28,872
minister?

390
00:37:29,915 --> 00:37:30,999
I'm really sorry.

391
00:37:44,554 --> 00:37:45,389
Please first

392
00:37:46,181 --> 00:37:47,391
Excuse me

393
00:38:02,406 --> 00:38:06,994
The time has come, let's start

394
00:38:07,077 --> 00:38:10,497
Today, our company's Kobe will explain

395
00:38:11,498 --> 00:38:16,962
Our proposal is
A new taste of milk and fruit

396
00:38:17,045 --> 00:38:20,257
Using seasonal fruits from partner farms across the country

397
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:23,385
Fruit Ole Drink

398
00:38:24,386 --> 00:38:26,179
Peach Au Lait from Yamanashi Prefecture

399
00:38:26,263 --> 00:38:29,808
Mango Au Lait from Miyazaki Prefecture
Strawberry Au Lait from Tochigi Prefecture…

400
00:38:29,891 --> 00:38:32,936
But this fruit ole project...

401
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:33,854
good

402
00:38:38,483 --> 00:38:40,110
The customer called and rejected us.

403
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:46,033
I told you this plan is weak.

404
00:38:46,116 --> 00:38:47,492
sorry

405
00:38:47,576 --> 00:38:51,663
Inoue, you use too much paper.

406
00:38:52,247 --> 00:38:54,124
The client rejected us

407
00:38:54,207 --> 00:38:56,626
and decided to jointly develop with our competitors

408
00:38:56,710 --> 00:39:00,047
Fruit Au Lait
Our company's own brand launch

409
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:03,091
But in the end, due to poor sales, it was discontinued early.

410
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:06,636
Pear Au Lait from Yamagata Prefecture

411
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:10,640
Orange au leche from Wakayama Prefecture
Various fruit drinks...

412
00:39:12,642 --> 00:39:14,478
These are not our proposals.

413
00:39:14,561 --> 00:39:15,395
It's bubble tea

414
00:39:21,693 --> 00:39:22,527
Pearl milk tea?

415
00:39:22,611 --> 00:39:25,238
Please ignore the information on hand for the time being.

416
00:39:26,114 --> 00:39:28,700
It’s bubble tea. Bubble tea will become a trend!

417
00:39:28,784 --> 00:39:33,371
But bubble tea is a while ago
A popular Taiwanese drink?

418
00:39:33,455 --> 00:39:35,123
It's not for sale now.

419
00:39:35,207 --> 00:39:38,293
No, it will be a big hit next time.

420
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:41,463
It's real bubble tea
Will become popular words

421
00:39:41,546 --> 00:39:44,716
They will even open a "Tokyo Bubble Tea Park" in Harajuku

422
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,843
"Tokyo Bubble Tea Paradise"?

423
00:39:46,927 --> 00:39:48,386
It's true

424
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:51,431
If you start selling now
You can be at the forefront of the trend

425
00:39:51,515 --> 00:39:53,308
Please trust me

426
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:54,559
Bubble milk drink

427
00:39:54,643 --> 00:39:57,270
The craze will continue to grow steadily
Until the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic

428
00:39:57,354 --> 00:39:58,188
Coronavirus?

429
00:40:00,607 --> 00:40:02,275
What is the COVID-19 pandemic?

430
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,412
I'll hang up then. Thank you.

431
00:40:19,042 --> 00:40:20,961
This is the fastest rejection by a customer.

432
00:40:22,003 --> 00:40:23,004
sorry

433
00:40:24,047 --> 00:40:26,633
Is a briefing a place for you to daydream?

434
00:40:26,716 --> 00:40:29,261
Why drink bubble tea? Searching for bubble tea?

435
00:40:29,344 --> 00:40:31,680
What about Tokyo Bubble Tea Paradise?

436
00:40:31,763 --> 00:40:34,182
If there really is such a thing in the world

437
00:40:34,266 --> 00:40:36,351
I danced the "Nightly Suolang Festival" dance naked

438
00:40:38,061 --> 00:40:40,522
If you honestly carry out the briefing on Fruit Au Lait

439
00:40:40,605 --> 00:40:41,731
The plan will be approved.

440
00:40:43,066 --> 00:40:44,693
I'm sorry

441
00:40:44,776 --> 00:40:46,945
What a loss your reckless behavior caused!

442
00:40:49,656 --> 00:40:52,826
Kobe: She has too much work to do lately.

443
00:40:52,909 --> 00:40:54,578
And he didn't seem to sleep well.

444
00:40:54,661 --> 00:40:55,954
I didn't sleep either.

445
00:40:56,037 --> 00:40:57,747
I only slept for five hours yesterday

446
00:40:58,331 --> 00:41:00,750
Just making excuses

447
00:41:02,043 --> 00:41:07,841
Remember to use the back side of the paper when printing

448
00:41:07,924 --> 00:41:11,845
I'm sorry, Deputy Section Chief Sumiyoshi, I took the initiative.

449
00:41:13,597 --> 00:41:14,931
You are too tired

450
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:30,697
Sorry Misa

451
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:33,992
I made a mistake when I copied and pasted the venue address

452
00:41:34,951 --> 00:41:37,871
You panicked during the presentation
It's all my fault, right?

453
00:41:37,954 --> 00:41:38,997
I'm really sorry.

454
00:41:41,041 --> 00:41:42,542
Sorry Misa

455
00:41:43,084 --> 00:41:46,004
I made a mistake when I copied and pasted the venue address

456
00:41:46,838 --> 00:41:49,799
You panicked during the presentation
It's all my fault, right?

457
00:41:49,883 --> 00:41:50,842
I'm really sorry.

458
00:41:50,926 --> 00:41:52,928
No, it's not your fault.

459
00:41:53,929 --> 00:41:57,474
The failure of the briefing is my fault

460
00:42:11,238 --> 00:42:13,740
Let's go eat some delicious food and ask your friends to come with us.

461
00:42:13,823 --> 00:42:16,284
I have something to do today

462
00:42:27,879 --> 00:42:29,756
How long will this last?

463
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:32,592
Even if it was a dream before death, it seemed a bit too long.

464
00:42:32,676 --> 00:42:35,136
On September 18, 2025, I…

465
00:42:35,845 --> 00:42:41,184
-Grand opening today
-Grand opening today

466
00:42:41,518 --> 00:42:43,561
Killed by Reina and Tomoya

467
00:42:44,312 --> 00:42:47,274
Then I went back to ten years ago with my memories

468
00:42:47,357 --> 00:42:50,568
That is September 18, 2015

469
00:42:54,406 --> 00:42:55,657
2015…

470
00:43:14,968 --> 00:43:18,638
The shop is hidden in a small alley in Jimbocho

471
00:43:25,645 --> 00:43:27,814
(This store closed at the end of December 2015)

472
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:36,448
(Bean Game Hall)

473
00:43:36,531 --> 00:43:37,824
This secret shop

474
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:41,411
A place I thought I would never visit again

475
00:43:41,494 --> 00:43:42,495
Misa

476
00:43:43,455 --> 00:43:44,914
dad

477
00:43:44,998 --> 00:43:47,459
Are you lost? I should pick you up.

478
00:43:47,542 --> 00:43:48,793
What? It's okay.

479
00:43:48,877 --> 00:43:50,712
- I just took a detour
-Is that so?

480
00:43:50,795 --> 00:43:52,672
A very kind student showed me the way.

481
00:43:54,132 --> 00:43:55,675
Why do we want to meet here?

482
00:43:55,759 --> 00:43:58,762
The owner and his wife of this shop

483
00:43:58,845 --> 00:44:00,638
Took my car when traveling in Toyama

484
00:44:00,722 --> 00:44:01,681
Right

485
00:44:01,765 --> 00:44:03,558
As soon as they heard that my daughter was in Tokyo

486
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:06,269
Just tell me next time I come to Tokyo
Remember to come to their store

487
00:44:06,353 --> 00:44:07,979
- Come in
-good

488
00:44:08,313 --> 00:44:09,814
I don't know if the boss is here.

489
00:44:16,905 --> 00:44:18,198
So cute

490
00:44:18,281 --> 00:44:20,200
So cute

491
00:44:20,283 --> 00:44:22,619
Beautiful dessert shop

492
00:44:23,078 --> 00:44:24,704
-Wow
-Welcome

493
00:44:25,121 --> 00:44:26,831
-Hello
-Oops!

494
00:44:27,457 --> 00:44:28,541
husband

495
00:44:28,625 --> 00:44:30,585
-Toyama's driver is here
- They remember me

496
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:31,836
From Toyama?

497
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:34,089
- Oops
-haven't seen you for a long time

498
00:44:34,172 --> 00:44:36,049
-Thanks for taking the time to come.
-Thank you very much at that time

499
00:44:36,132 --> 00:44:38,510
Finally, I really came

500
00:44:38,593 --> 00:44:41,054
This is our recommended signature bean turtle tea set

501
00:44:41,137 --> 00:44:42,055
Thanks

502
00:44:42,138 --> 00:44:43,515
- Please enjoy your meal
-Thanks

503
00:44:44,349 --> 00:44:45,517
-dad
-What's wrong?

504
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:47,394
Why did you suddenly come to Tokyo?

505
00:44:49,270 --> 00:44:52,399
I want to come with you occasionally
Enjoy a 3pm snack together

506
00:44:56,528 --> 00:44:58,113
-how is your day?
-Um

507
00:44:58,238 --> 00:44:59,447
That's good

508
00:44:59,823 --> 00:45:00,657
That's right

509
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:02,617
There is a turtle in our university pond

510
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:05,620
-Right
- But it's hot this year

511
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:08,248
The pond looks like it's going to dry up so I'm worried

512
00:45:08,331 --> 00:45:09,999
You are so kind Misa

513
00:45:10,083 --> 00:45:12,168
That's not the case.

514
00:45:14,587 --> 00:45:16,339
Being a good person is hard work.

515
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:19,467
If that's true, it's inherited from my father.

516
00:45:21,177 --> 00:45:24,514
Instead of worrying about the turtle, worry about yourself.

517
00:45:24,597 --> 00:45:26,141
- Look
- Really

518
00:45:26,224 --> 00:45:28,435
You always like to take it and make origami

519
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:30,145
So cool

520
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:36,192
Dad, I don't care where I am.
Whenever you get into trouble

521
00:45:36,276 --> 00:45:39,529
I'll drive my taxi to find you

522
00:45:39,612 --> 00:45:41,865
Driving a taxi?

523
00:45:42,615 --> 00:45:47,203
I think at that time
Dad should know that he doesn't have much time left.

524
00:46:05,388 --> 00:46:07,140
Three o'clock snack

525
00:46:28,953 --> 00:46:32,165
As long as you want to go
No matter where you go, you can go

526
00:46:33,249 --> 00:46:34,918
You will definitely meet...

527
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:38,713
Someone who truly cherishes you

528
00:46:40,632 --> 00:46:41,591
Be careful on the road

529
00:46:43,593 --> 00:46:45,011
Thanks

530
00:46:49,641 --> 00:46:50,850
dad

531
00:47:24,092 --> 00:47:26,386
Hello? Grandma?

532
00:47:27,262 --> 00:47:30,306
Did you just finish dinner? What did you eat?

533
00:47:30,807 --> 00:47:33,142
Creamy Grilled Scallops

534
00:47:33,768 --> 00:47:35,520
Really good

535
00:47:37,313 --> 00:47:39,899
Are you Misa?

536
00:47:42,443 --> 00:47:45,238
Yes, I am Misa.

537
00:47:46,197 --> 00:47:49,993
Eat well

538
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:53,621
Yeah, I eat a lot.

539
00:47:54,998 --> 00:47:56,666
I'll call you next time.

540
00:47:57,458 --> 00:47:59,043
Goodnight Grandma

541
00:48:15,435 --> 00:48:16,686
dad

542
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:21,816
Is it you who brought me here?

543
00:48:38,249 --> 00:48:39,792
I'm ten years younger

544
00:48:41,836 --> 00:48:45,131
I am healthy and I have an appetite.

545
00:48:48,801 --> 00:48:53,139
Can I start over?
If I could start over from ten years ago...

546
00:48:59,646 --> 00:49:02,607
That scarf doesn't suit you.

547
00:49:07,528 --> 00:49:09,697
(Happy birthday, Misa!
This scarf suits you very well.

548
00:49:26,422 --> 00:49:28,216
(Reina)

549
00:49:43,564 --> 00:49:44,482
Hello?

550
00:49:55,451 --> 00:49:58,538
(Suzutoya Holdings Limited
Planning Department 2 (Misa Kobe)

551
00:49:59,372 --> 00:50:03,376
Pearl milk tea?

552
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:09,632
If Japan wins today's game

553
00:50:09,716 --> 00:50:11,968
It will be Japan's first
Winning the World Cup

554
00:50:12,051 --> 00:50:13,761
-Is this true or false?
-Isn't it amazing?

555
00:50:13,845 --> 00:50:14,846
Let's go watch the game

556
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:23,229
(Japan vs. South Africa kicks off at 12:45 am)

557
00:50:26,524 --> 00:50:27,358
Misa

558
00:50:30,153 --> 00:50:32,447
You left so early yesterday

559
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:34,449
I have a lot of things I want to talk to you about.

560
00:50:36,451 --> 00:50:37,493
yes

561
00:50:38,244 --> 00:50:40,079
I want to talk to you too

562
00:50:40,830 --> 00:50:41,748
He is here

563
00:50:42,331 --> 00:50:44,167
Cheng is here too

564
00:50:47,462 --> 00:50:49,380
Let me handle today's bill.

565
00:50:50,715 --> 00:50:52,258
-Have you been waiting for a long time?
-Won't

566
00:50:53,134 --> 00:50:54,177
Misa

567
00:50:54,594 --> 00:50:56,304
You are so slow, come up quickly

568
00:50:57,930 --> 00:50:58,973
- Let's go
-good

569
00:51:02,935 --> 00:51:04,270
I'm getting more and more excited

570
00:51:04,353 --> 00:51:06,898
- Let's have a toast
-good

571
00:51:06,981 --> 00:51:08,983
-cheers!
-cheers!

572
00:51:09,650 --> 00:51:10,485
very nice

573
00:51:12,904 --> 00:51:16,908
Rina, you still help Misa pick clothes, right?

574
00:51:17,492 --> 00:51:22,121
Misa's taste is really bad
She is also reluctant to buy better clothes and cosmetics

575
00:51:22,205 --> 00:51:23,206
In the student days

576
00:51:23,289 --> 00:51:26,083
She would even sew up the holes in her socks and continue wearing them

577
00:51:26,167 --> 00:51:27,084
That's ridiculous

578
00:51:27,168 --> 00:51:28,836
Youya, can you tell me about her?

579
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:30,421
Same as the first time

580
00:51:30,505 --> 00:51:33,883
World Cup Day
The four of us were drinking at this sports bar

581
00:51:33,966 --> 00:51:35,927
This is Goro Maruho...

582
00:51:36,010 --> 00:51:38,262
But I was really moved by the story.

583
00:51:38,763 --> 00:51:41,307
It was when Misa was bullied in high school.

584
00:51:41,390 --> 00:51:43,226
Lina, you accompany her home every day

585
00:51:43,309 --> 00:51:45,394
Did I tell you about this?

586
00:51:45,478 --> 00:51:46,854
Well, you said

587
00:51:47,855 --> 00:51:49,398
Misa, have you been bullied before?

588
00:51:52,693 --> 00:51:55,530
Misa is the type that is easily misunderstood

589
00:51:55,613 --> 00:51:59,033
But I am the only one who knows how good she is

590
00:52:01,744 --> 00:52:02,995
-Misa!
-Are you okay?

591
00:52:03,079 --> 00:52:04,705
- I'm sorry
-Excuse me

592
00:52:04,789 --> 00:52:06,541
I'll get the tissue right away.

593
00:52:06,624 --> 00:52:08,376
-Are you okay?
-fine

594
00:52:08,459 --> 00:52:09,752
Do you want to go to the bathroom?

595
00:52:10,628 --> 00:52:11,629
Let's go

596
00:52:12,463 --> 00:52:13,840
You're soaking wet

597
00:52:16,259 --> 00:52:19,011
Misa, you are so careless.

598
00:52:19,512 --> 00:52:21,931
But it's also the waiter's fault for not paying attention.

599
00:52:22,014 --> 00:52:23,933
You should complain to him.

600
00:52:26,018 --> 00:52:28,396
I bumped into him this time too.

601
00:52:28,479 --> 00:52:29,605
Misa, have you been bullied before?

602
00:52:29,689 --> 00:52:30,606
right

603
00:52:31,232 --> 00:52:33,776
Misa is the type that is easily misunderstood

604
00:52:33,860 --> 00:52:38,239
But I am the only one who knows how good she is

605
00:52:39,866 --> 00:52:41,576
I'm going to the bathroom

606
00:52:41,659 --> 00:52:43,077
-good
-Go ahead

607
00:52:46,622 --> 00:52:47,456
"This time too"?

608
00:52:49,292 --> 00:52:51,502
I mean it's not his fault.

609
00:52:52,003 --> 00:52:55,590
Misa is so kind, you are really a good person

610
00:52:55,673 --> 00:52:58,092
You won't be angry no matter what.
I just like that about you.

611
00:53:00,678 --> 00:53:02,597
You're still the same in the end.

612
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:05,683
She looks like a good girl and a victim.

613
00:53:15,818 --> 00:53:16,819
Good or bad

614
00:53:17,570 --> 00:53:20,740
Makoto said he and Tomoya's college classmates

615
00:53:20,823 --> 00:53:22,867
The topics are so different that they can't chat.

616
00:53:27,997 --> 00:53:31,042
Misa, you and Tomoya have been dating for half a year, right?

617
00:53:31,792 --> 00:53:33,544
We've almost talked about that, right?

618
00:53:34,211 --> 00:53:35,463
What matter?

619
00:53:35,838 --> 00:53:36,672
marry

620
00:53:36,756 --> 00:53:40,885
I actually discussed this with my boyfriend.
We think the time is right.

621
00:53:41,385 --> 00:53:45,181
Although friends are sometimes unreliable

622
00:53:45,264 --> 00:53:47,266
But you're so sensible, it's okay.

623
00:53:48,726 --> 00:53:51,020
Lina always looks down on us

624
00:53:51,103 --> 00:53:53,564
Not only me, she also treats her friends the same way

625
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:57,485
If we got married at the same time

626
00:53:57,568 --> 00:54:01,781
Having children at the same time and raising them together
That must be fun.

627
00:54:01,864 --> 00:54:06,994
Then we become grandmas
If our husbands passed away earlier than us

628
00:54:07,078 --> 00:54:09,789
I will live with you

629
00:54:22,635 --> 00:54:24,470
I'll be your friend

630
00:54:25,638 --> 00:54:26,472
Rina

631
00:54:27,431 --> 00:54:32,186
Your wish is for me to stay by your side forever

632
00:54:32,269 --> 00:54:35,189
Then will I always live worse than you?

633
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:40,236
The Japanese team successfully regained the ball!

634
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:41,612
-How are you?
-Um

635
00:54:42,446 --> 00:54:45,783
The competition is now very exciting. This player is called Goromaru.

636
00:54:46,283 --> 00:54:49,245
He is famous, right?
After winning the game, he became a celebrity.

637
00:54:50,705 --> 00:54:52,123
They win?

638
00:54:52,206 --> 00:54:56,252
- You are indeed an outsider
-This is a great opportunity but...

639
00:54:56,335 --> 00:54:59,171
South Africa is incredibly strong

640
00:54:59,255 --> 00:55:01,549
There is no way Japan can win

641
00:55:01,632 --> 00:55:05,594
Using football as an analogy
The difficulty is like asking Japan to beat Brazil

642
00:55:07,388 --> 00:55:08,639
What?

643
00:55:09,140 --> 00:55:13,102
September 20, 2015 Friends also said this to me

644
00:55:17,106 --> 00:55:20,234
Misa, a miracle happened. It is a miracle!

645
00:55:20,317 --> 00:55:21,444
So cool

646
00:55:21,527 --> 00:55:26,115
I think as long as I'm with you
You can have a wonderful life

647
00:55:27,033 --> 00:55:30,745
He said that at that moment he saw a happy future

648
00:55:46,635 --> 00:55:48,554
That's why you can't get a girlfriend.

649
00:55:48,637 --> 00:55:49,472
So loving

650
00:55:49,555 --> 00:55:50,890
- So cute
-Right?

651
00:55:53,142 --> 00:55:54,018
She blushed

652
00:55:58,898 --> 00:56:00,024
Is this true or false?

653
00:56:01,859 --> 00:56:04,570
Misa, a miracle happened. It is a miracle!

654
00:56:05,321 --> 00:56:09,784
I think as long as I'm with you
You can have a wonderful life

655
00:56:09,867 --> 00:56:11,077
This is a historic moment!

656
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:12,828
"Miracle in Brighton"

657
00:56:12,912 --> 00:56:15,081
Right now!

658
00:56:15,164 --> 00:56:17,333
What are you doing?

659
00:56:17,416 --> 00:56:18,584
Friends?

660
00:56:20,294 --> 00:56:21,629
Misa

661
00:56:21,712 --> 00:56:23,089
Misa, where are you going?

662
00:56:25,257 --> 00:56:26,425
Misa

663
00:56:27,093 --> 00:56:28,969
Wait where are you going?

664
00:56:29,053 --> 00:56:30,304
Misa

665
00:56:31,430 --> 00:56:34,266
I have already booked a restaurant for the 23rd.

666
00:56:35,101 --> 00:56:36,352
Misa

667
00:57:04,004 --> 00:57:05,756
(Proposal)

668
00:57:08,217 --> 00:57:10,136
(Meet the parents)

669
00:57:10,219 --> 00:57:12,763
I asked a famous fortune teller to tell your fortune.

670
00:57:13,389 --> 00:57:15,808
The teacher said that if you don't hold a wedding within a year

671
00:57:15,891 --> 00:57:18,519
The child you give birth to will be sick.

672
00:57:28,988 --> 00:57:32,324
If you knew what was going to happen next
Can you escape fate?

673
00:57:32,741 --> 00:57:33,576
But…

674
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:35,077
Excuse me

675
00:57:35,161 --> 00:57:39,081
Thank you for giving us the opportunity
This joint research and development of cooperative products...

676
00:57:39,165 --> 00:57:40,541
This is the fastest rejection by a customer.

677
00:57:40,624 --> 00:57:42,626
What a loss your reckless behavior caused!

678
00:57:42,710 --> 00:57:45,921
Even if I avoid being late
In the end, the briefing failed.

679
00:57:46,005 --> 00:57:47,464
Only I know how good she is...

680
00:57:47,548 --> 00:57:50,384
At the bar, it was the same as the first time
Knocked over the beer

681
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:53,345
Even if I change my actions
What is going to happen will happen

682
00:57:53,429 --> 00:57:54,263
(wedding)

683
00:57:54,346 --> 00:57:56,724
In this case, the future ten years from now will also be...

684
00:57:56,807 --> 00:57:59,810
Why do you think I married you?

685
00:57:59,894 --> 00:58:02,479
My life is a failure because of you

686
00:58:02,563 --> 00:58:06,150
I have disliked you since I was a child

687
00:58:34,428 --> 00:58:36,472
How are you?

688
00:58:37,097 --> 00:58:38,349
Please come over here

689
00:58:41,852 --> 00:58:44,688
Please wait for it to cool down.

690
00:58:52,863 --> 00:58:54,823
You seem to be familiar with the process

691
00:58:55,407 --> 00:58:58,452
Because I was scalded by this kettle before

692
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:02,414
I'm really sorry

693
00:59:05,834 --> 00:59:07,336
Why are you apologizing?

694
00:59:08,754 --> 00:59:11,507
Because I should be the one who got burned.

695
00:59:11,590 --> 00:59:13,634
But you, Minister, replaced me...

696
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:15,886
replace?

697
00:59:18,013 --> 00:59:19,390
What about Tokyo Bubble Tea Paradise?

698
00:59:19,473 --> 00:59:21,350
What a loss your reckless behavior caused!

699
00:59:21,433 --> 00:59:22,559
Only I know...

700
00:59:22,643 --> 00:59:24,270
What is going to happen will happen

701
00:59:25,229 --> 00:59:26,438
This doesn't work...

702
00:59:27,523 --> 00:59:29,566
I'm so sorry I'm late!

703
00:59:30,985 --> 00:59:32,319
Sorry, I'm sorry.

704
00:59:37,866 --> 00:59:39,493
What are you doing?

705
00:59:40,035 --> 00:59:41,328
Very hot

706
00:59:43,205 --> 00:59:47,167
As long as I find someone to replace me
Can it change your destiny?

707
00:59:47,793 --> 00:59:48,627
What’s wrong with you?

708
00:59:49,962 --> 00:59:50,796
fine

709
00:59:56,927 --> 00:59:58,804
Please go to the hospital immediately

710
01:00:00,097 --> 01:00:01,849
What do you do in the company?

711
01:00:02,558 --> 01:00:03,892
It's the holiday season now

712
01:00:04,435 --> 01:00:06,270
I have work that is not yet completed.

713
01:00:09,398 --> 01:00:13,610
Kobe, you strike me as a good person.

714
01:00:15,571 --> 01:00:20,659
I've seen you alone
Work before and after get off work

715
01:00:21,243 --> 01:00:23,912
Even including extra work from other departments

716
01:00:24,955 --> 01:00:25,956
Misa

717
01:00:27,624 --> 01:00:29,543
Could you help me compile this information?

718
01:00:29,668 --> 01:00:31,337
I'm busy now

719
01:00:32,379 --> 01:00:33,630
Okay, I'll handle it.

720
01:00:34,173 --> 01:00:35,382
You really helped me a lot.

721
01:00:43,515 --> 01:00:44,767
You don't seem to reject others.

722
01:00:45,934 --> 01:00:48,270
No matter how unreasonable the task others throw at you is

723
01:00:51,815 --> 01:00:57,738
Good natured, diligent
A good man who is willing to sacrifice himself

724
01:00:57,821 --> 01:00:59,823
Is this how you see yourself?

725
01:01:01,784 --> 01:01:02,618
What?

726
01:01:02,701 --> 01:01:06,914
Do you know why you attract so many people?
A rotten person like garbage?

727
01:01:08,374 --> 01:01:12,002
It's not because you're a good person.

728
01:01:13,504 --> 01:01:15,631
It's because you are too naive and easy to be deceived.

729
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:21,303
For ordinary people

730
01:01:22,262 --> 01:01:23,555
If a scumbag approaches you

731
01:01:23,639 --> 01:01:25,682
Everyone will be alert and keep their distance from them.

732
01:01:26,767 --> 01:01:29,478
Anyone with a little bit of observation will notice it.

733
01:01:32,064 --> 01:01:34,233
But people like you

734
01:01:34,316 --> 01:01:36,193
No matter if it's garbage or scum

735
01:01:36,276 --> 01:01:39,238
You will accept it with open arms

736
01:01:39,321 --> 01:01:41,281
Then even if you are hurt, you choose to endure

737
01:01:41,365 --> 01:01:44,368
Just playing the tragic heroine

738
01:01:46,495 --> 01:01:51,750
You gave control of your life to the garbage.
Let yourself fall all the way down

739
01:01:53,168 --> 01:01:56,422
But I think I am a good person with a strong heart.

740
01:01:58,215 --> 01:01:59,591
How naive!

741
01:02:01,176 --> 01:02:02,511
I know this myself

742
01:02:05,764 --> 01:02:09,309
I know it without you telling me

743
01:02:11,228 --> 01:02:13,814
I happily pick up unwanted trash

744
01:02:13,897 --> 01:02:17,651
Still always looked down upon even so...

745
01:02:18,986 --> 01:02:23,740
I'm still trying to deceive myself
I have a good life

746
01:02:25,033 --> 01:02:26,452
I know all this

747
01:02:27,494 --> 01:02:31,206
I know it's going to turn out this way
It's because I'm so stupid

748
01:02:31,957 --> 01:02:32,958
But this does not mean

749
01:02:33,041 --> 01:02:36,879
I have to accept the advice of an unrelated company executive
Boss me

750
01:02:36,962 --> 01:02:38,797
No matter who

751
01:02:38,881 --> 01:02:41,717
You have no right to comment on my life.

752
01:02:50,142 --> 01:02:51,226
You'll be angry.

753
01:02:53,854 --> 01:02:58,817
When dignity is trampled upon by others
Being angry is a legitimate behavior

754
01:03:00,861 --> 01:03:02,321
Just throw away the garbage

755
01:03:03,489 --> 01:03:08,952
People who don't want you to be happy
There is no need for it to appear in your life

756
01:03:24,051 --> 01:03:26,053
This is a gift in return for helping me treat my burns.

757
01:03:28,347 --> 01:03:29,806
Childhood

758
01:03:30,557 --> 01:03:33,227
The moment you put the candy in your mouth

759
01:03:33,310 --> 01:03:34,728
Do you believe it?

760
01:03:35,479 --> 01:03:36,980
Believe that you are happy

761
01:03:54,081 --> 01:03:56,124
Welcome home, Dad.

762
01:04:24,528 --> 01:04:25,696
Same as then

763
01:04:27,447 --> 01:04:33,662
You just need to believe that you can change your life

764
01:04:37,082 --> 01:04:38,292
Minister Suzuki

765
01:04:43,088 --> 01:04:46,925
I'm sorry for saying something rude to you.

766
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:49,595
Me too

767
01:05:22,794 --> 01:05:23,629
Kobe Misa

768
01:05:23,712 --> 01:05:25,631
Please be my wife

769
01:05:27,674 --> 01:05:29,509
I will protect you forever

770
01:05:29,593 --> 01:05:31,428
I will definitely make you happy

771
01:05:43,732 --> 01:05:45,984
The future you talked about never came true

772
01:05:47,235 --> 01:05:49,613
You were only nice to me at the beginning

773
01:05:50,197 --> 01:05:53,116
Never cared about my happiness

774
01:05:55,452 --> 01:05:56,286
I do

775
01:05:57,162 --> 01:05:58,372
If you don't dislike me

776
01:06:00,791 --> 01:06:02,167
Please give me more advice

777
01:06:04,878 --> 01:06:09,216
I always play a supporting role in their stories

778
01:06:10,175 --> 01:06:11,301
Sorry Misa

779
01:06:11,635 --> 01:06:14,971
We are both lonely and can only rely on each other

780
01:06:15,055 --> 01:06:17,432
Lina and I are both sick because of you.
Being forced to be unbearable

781
01:06:18,100 --> 01:06:21,103
That's why I lose my mind
Our mental state is not normal

782
01:06:23,271 --> 01:06:27,275
Zoom out a little further.
This is such a ridiculous show.

783
01:06:28,402 --> 01:06:31,947
They're terrible, but I'm no better.

784
01:06:32,823 --> 01:06:35,617
I ruined my life.

785
01:06:36,493 --> 01:06:37,327
Get out of the way

786
01:06:43,333 --> 01:06:44,376
Tomoya

787
01:06:45,669 --> 01:06:47,754
I have decided

788
01:06:51,091 --> 01:06:56,179
I must be happy

789
01:07:02,978 --> 01:07:04,229
It really suits you.

790
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:07,274
-I am coming
-Rina

791
01:07:08,108 --> 01:07:10,110
Did he propose to you?

792
01:07:10,902 --> 01:07:14,698
In fact, my friends have been asking for my opinion.

793
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:17,492
You knew this a long time ago? Why didn't you tell me?

794
01:07:17,576 --> 01:07:19,619
-congratulations
-Thanks

795
01:07:21,830 --> 01:07:23,457
What is going to happen will happen

796
01:07:24,124 --> 01:07:25,459
The script won't change

797
01:07:26,418 --> 01:07:27,335
In that case…

798
01:07:28,003 --> 01:07:29,963
Then just change the actor

799
01:07:30,630 --> 01:07:32,257
Thank you so much

800
01:07:32,340 --> 01:07:34,426
Oops, I feel like crying too.

801
01:07:40,974 --> 01:07:43,810
(Misa: I do)

802
01:07:43,894 --> 01:07:45,145
(I do)

803
01:07:50,984 --> 01:07:52,652
So how did you propose?

804
01:07:54,237 --> 01:07:55,322
It's a secret

805
01:07:55,405 --> 01:07:57,491
What? Tell me.

806
01:07:57,574 --> 01:07:59,075
I won't tell you

807
01:07:59,159 --> 01:08:00,744
You are so bad, I will ask Misa

808
01:08:00,827 --> 01:08:02,829
Lina, when will you find happiness?

809
01:08:02,913 --> 01:08:06,833
You are too much. I will find happiness too.

810
01:08:07,626 --> 01:08:09,503
When I get married...

811
01:08:09,586 --> 01:08:14,299
I'm giving you my awful life.

812
01:08:15,133 --> 01:08:18,678
Lina, please marry my husband.

813
01:10:55,043 --> 01:10:58,046
