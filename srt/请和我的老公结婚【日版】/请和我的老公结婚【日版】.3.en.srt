1
00:00:14,223 --> 00:00:15,057
Oh, I'm sorry!

2
00:00:31,407 --> 00:00:32,533
Are you okay?

3
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:34,744
Thank you.

4
00:00:37,246 --> 00:00:38,122
I'm sorry.

5
00:00:38,998 --> 00:00:41,000
I tripped at the top of the stairs, and...

6
00:00:43,294 --> 00:00:45,212
You're Director Suzuki, right?

7
00:00:45,296 --> 00:00:47,173
I'm Esaka
from the second planning division.

8
00:00:48,966 --> 00:00:49,925
I'm Suzuki.

9
00:00:52,553 --> 00:00:53,471
Thank you.

10
00:00:58,601 --> 00:01:02,104
It looks like I sprained my ankle.

11
00:01:14,325 --> 00:01:15,159
Huh?

12
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:16,410
Misa?

13
00:01:18,496 --> 00:01:20,206
-Morning!
-Morning.

14
00:01:20,289 --> 00:01:21,624
Good morning.

15
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:24,585
Wow, Ms. Kanbe, you're looking cute today.

16
00:01:25,002 --> 00:01:26,670
Think it's too much for the office?

17
00:01:26,754 --> 00:01:28,798
-No, it looks good. It's fine.
-Really?

18
00:01:28,881 --> 00:01:31,008
Bright colors really suit you, Ms. Kanbe.

19
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:32,259
Misa, good morning.

20
00:01:32,343 --> 00:01:34,512
-Hey, you cut your hair?
-How was the reunion?

21
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:35,679
You really wanna know?

22
00:01:35,763 --> 00:01:36,847
-You did, right?
-Tell me!

23
00:01:44,355 --> 00:01:46,232
Ms. Esaka hasn't come in yet.

24
00:01:46,816 --> 00:01:48,025
Have you heard anything?

25
00:01:56,033 --> 00:01:58,077
Sumiyoshi, Kanbe, over here.

26
00:01:58,994 --> 00:01:59,829
-Okay.
-Okay.

27
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:07,795
Hey, what is this?

28
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:10,464
You really think
this will get approved in the meeting?

29
00:02:10,548 --> 00:02:11,382
Excuse me...

30
00:02:12,758 --> 00:02:14,468
may I ask what the issue was?

31
00:02:14,552 --> 00:02:16,095
It's not convincing.

32
00:02:16,178 --> 00:02:17,304
Not convincing at all.

33
00:02:19,765 --> 00:02:21,892
Specifically, which items?

34
00:02:25,187 --> 00:02:27,314
You can't figure it out
without asking someone?

35
00:02:27,398 --> 00:02:31,944
Then what's your head even for, huh?

36
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:35,739
Always trying to take the easy way out.

37
00:02:35,823 --> 00:02:37,533
My apologies.

38
00:02:37,616 --> 00:02:39,243
If you could please tell us--

39
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:40,703
The whole thing, all of it.

40
00:02:41,704 --> 00:02:43,330
Fix it before the meeting.

41
00:02:44,874 --> 00:02:49,503
Hey, Inoue, that's not your
personal storage space, come on!

42
00:02:57,845 --> 00:02:59,847
The meeting is this week, isn't it?

43
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:00,764
Yeah.

44
00:03:01,056 --> 00:03:03,392
I submitted the proposal
a month in advance

45
00:03:03,475 --> 00:03:06,312
to prevent any last-minute changes.

46
00:03:08,022 --> 00:03:09,815
He was always like that every time.

47
00:03:10,816 --> 00:03:11,775
Huh?

48
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:12,693
Oh, nothing.

49
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:14,737
Morning!

50
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:15,738
Good morning.

51
00:03:16,155 --> 00:03:18,032
My apologies for being late.

52
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:19,700
Were you not feeling well?

53
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:21,493
I blew up your phone worried sick!

54
00:03:21,577 --> 00:03:22,995
Thank you for your concern.

55
00:03:23,495 --> 00:03:26,624
I sprained my ankle
and went to the hospital.

56
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:27,666
Are you okay?

57
00:03:28,292 --> 00:03:30,920
Poor thing. Don't overdo it.

58
00:03:31,003 --> 00:03:32,713
Take half the day off if you need.

59
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:33,714
-No, no.
-Yeah.

60
00:03:34,256 --> 00:03:36,717
Here, sit down, sit down.
Take it slow, nice and slow.

61
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,303
-I'm sorry for the inconvenience.
-No, not at all.

62
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:41,221
Sit down slowly. Yep, careful!

63
00:03:41,305 --> 00:03:43,015
Okay, thank you.

64
00:03:43,474 --> 00:03:45,434
I think I've got a compress in my desk.

65
00:03:45,517 --> 00:03:46,393
I'll go get it.

66
00:03:46,477 --> 00:03:47,519
Thank you.

67
00:03:48,354 --> 00:03:49,563
-Ms. Kanbe.
-Yes?

68
00:03:49,647 --> 00:03:52,441
You have a call from Tanabe
at L'Entr'acte Cafe.

69
00:03:52,524 --> 00:03:53,734
L'Entr'acte Cafe?

70
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:54,652
Yes.

71
00:03:57,738 --> 00:03:59,573
You're now speaking with Kanbe.

72
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:03,243
Oh, Tanabe?

73
00:04:18,008 --> 00:04:19,259
DIRECT-FROM-FARM VEGETABLES

74
00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:23,847
{\an8}Here you are.

75
00:04:27,977 --> 00:04:28,852
Welcome.

76
00:04:33,232 --> 00:04:34,066
-Okay.
-Wow.

77
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:36,026
Here's our signature salad galette lunch.

78
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:37,444
It looks so good!

79
00:04:37,528 --> 00:04:39,279
Please enjoy your meal.

80
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:44,535
Is it okay? It's lunchtime, isn't it?

81
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:46,954
Yeah, my part-time staff are great.

82
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:49,498
Plus, you're a special customer.

83
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,168
Okay then, I'll dig right in!

84
00:04:53,252 --> 00:04:54,086
Go ahead.

85
00:04:59,383 --> 00:05:01,260
Wow, this is fantastic!

86
00:05:01,343 --> 00:05:02,302
-Really?
-Yeah.

87
00:05:03,387 --> 00:05:05,347
It's amazing seeing you as an owner-chef.

88
00:05:05,431 --> 00:05:06,932
-Were you surprised?
-Yeah.

89
00:05:07,016 --> 00:05:10,060
I thought you'd be a director
or an actor or something.

90
00:05:10,144 --> 00:05:13,856
I did theater until university,
but it didn't work out.

91
00:05:14,523 --> 00:05:17,192
My part-time job as a chef
just grew into a career.

92
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:19,486
It seemed to suit me more.

93
00:05:19,862 --> 00:05:21,447
It's a lovely cafe.

94
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:22,364
Yeah.

95
00:05:22,448 --> 00:05:26,493
L'Entr'acte
means "intermission" in French.

96
00:05:27,119 --> 00:05:30,914
I wanted to make a place
where busy people can take a break.

97
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:35,502
Take a break, huh?

98
00:05:39,715 --> 00:05:42,301
Sorry for calling you at your company.

99
00:05:42,384 --> 00:05:43,260
That's okay.

100
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:44,720
I wanted to have a real talk.

101
00:05:46,055 --> 00:05:48,682
About that message you sent me before.

102
00:05:48,766 --> 00:05:50,559
I only just saw it recently. Sorry.

103
00:05:50,642 --> 00:05:51,727
No, not at all...

104
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:53,854
I'm just glad we were able to reconnect.

105
00:06:00,194 --> 00:06:04,364
Also, after what happened,
Mita and the others wanted to contact you.

106
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:06,700
They might hit you up on your socials.

107
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:09,953
I've never been good at social media.

108
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:12,331
When I look at it,
I feel like it drains my energy.

109
00:06:12,414 --> 00:06:13,248
Yeah.

110
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,044
REINA_ESK
CENTRAL HIGH SCHOOL CLASS REUNION

111
00:06:21,006 --> 00:06:22,007
DELETE YOUR ACCOUNT?
OK

112
00:06:22,091 --> 00:06:23,801
LOGIN

113
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:31,100
Maybe I should try it.

114
00:06:31,934 --> 00:06:32,768
Huh?

115
00:06:33,644 --> 00:06:38,148
At this point, I feel like
I don't care who posts what anymore.

116
00:06:38,232 --> 00:06:39,817
Oh... really?

117
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:40,734
Yeah.

118
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:43,946
Then follow my cafe.

119
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:45,155
-Follow?
-Yeah.

120
00:06:53,455 --> 00:06:54,665
-I did it!
-Okay.

121
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:57,376
Oh, this looks good too!

122
00:06:57,459 --> 00:06:58,544
-You think?
-Yeah.

123
00:07:05,843 --> 00:07:07,511
Sorry for intruding.

124
00:07:09,513 --> 00:07:10,681
Can I join you?

125
00:07:18,856 --> 00:07:21,775
I was actually just thinking
of reaching out to you today, Yuto.

126
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:27,239
I wanted to get together
with you and Misa, all three of us.

127
00:07:31,493 --> 00:07:32,494
I'm sorry.

128
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,253
I really regret
doing something so childish.

129
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:45,048
Back in our first year of high school,

130
00:07:45,549 --> 00:07:48,719
I was so scared that Yuto
would take you away from me.

131
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:53,807
You were the only friend I had.

132
00:07:54,558 --> 00:07:57,394
Wait, but I remember
you having lots of friends.

133
00:07:58,437 --> 00:07:59,646
Only on the surface.

134
00:08:00,731 --> 00:08:03,775
Misa was my only true friend.

135
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,863
What I did got so out of hand.

136
00:08:08,697 --> 00:08:12,451
I tried so many times
to tell the truth, but I couldn't.

137
00:08:13,619 --> 00:08:16,914
I've been carrying this guilt
over both of you all this time.

138
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:20,042
<i>Then why'd you trick me</i>
<i>into coming to the reunion?</i>

139
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:22,085
<i>You wanted to watch me suffer, didn't you?</i>

140
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:27,049
I don't expect you to forgive me,
but just let me say this.

141
00:08:29,343 --> 00:08:32,804
I have never once taken pleasure
in seeing you get hurt, Misa.

142
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:38,143
I really hope you can
find it in your heart to see that.

143
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:47,611
Reina, raise your head.

144
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:53,158
Enough already, Reina,

145
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:56,328
because I know...

146
00:08:58,914 --> 00:09:00,999
how you truly feel.

147
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:04,670
Misa.

148
00:09:12,761 --> 00:09:17,349
I was so worried you would abandon me
that I couldn't sleep last night.

149
00:09:18,267 --> 00:09:20,852
If it were me,
I'd never be able to forgive you.

150
00:09:20,936 --> 00:09:24,564
You and Yuto both have such big hearts.

151
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:28,277
You're way too good of a friend
for someone like me.

152
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:31,571
Is your ankle okay?

153
00:09:33,365 --> 00:09:35,659
It does hurt a bit when I walk.

154
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:42,291
Thanks.

155
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:48,922
So, there's something I need to tell you.

156
00:09:51,383 --> 00:09:54,970
Maybe it's karma for what I did to you...

157
00:09:55,804 --> 00:09:58,223
but I got a message
from some woman I don't know.

158
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:00,600
She said she's dating Seiya.

159
00:10:02,894 --> 00:10:06,356
Turns out he's been
two-timing me for three years.

160
00:10:07,733 --> 00:10:08,692
Huh? That's awful!

161
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:10,569
That scumbag, you should break...

162
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:11,862
Yeah, I broke up with him.

163
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:13,905
Huh? When?

164
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:15,115
This morning.

165
00:10:16,158 --> 00:10:18,243
<i>Huh? Wait, wait. This can't be right.</i>

166
00:10:18,327 --> 00:10:19,536
Please break up with me!

167
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:22,289
Delicious.

168
00:10:25,876 --> 00:10:28,545
<i>They fought for ages</i>
<i>after the cheating was exposed,</i>

169
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:32,090
<i>and then Reina got dumped</i>
<i>just before Christmas, right?</i>

170
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:36,178
<i>Then why?</i>
<i>Why did the breakup happen earlier?</i>

171
00:10:37,179 --> 00:10:39,639
But guess what? I also met someone.

172
00:10:40,599 --> 00:10:42,434
-Met someone?
-How should I say this?

173
00:10:42,517 --> 00:10:43,727
Is it fate?

174
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:48,523
Someone I barely knew existed before
suddenly just came into view!

175
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:50,484
It couldn't be...

176
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:52,527
Oh, Tomoya.

177
00:11:27,646 --> 00:11:28,480
Excuse me...

178
00:11:29,564 --> 00:11:31,483
Thank you for your help this morning.

179
00:11:32,067 --> 00:11:36,488
It was so reassuring to have you there
when I needed someone.

180
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:41,368
<i>Why, why, why?</i>

181
00:11:41,952 --> 00:11:44,454
<i>I know every single one</i>
<i>of Reina's past boyfriends.</i>

182
00:11:44,538 --> 00:11:47,874
<i>In my first life, she never had</i>
<i>any connection to Director Suzuki.</i>

183
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:49,918
<i>Could it be?</i>

184
00:11:50,419 --> 00:11:51,294
Sorry!

185
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:57,592
<i>He suddenly entered my life</i>
<i>the second time around...</i>

186
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:01,721
<i>and that caused Reina's feelings</i>
<i>to shift toward him?</i>

187
00:12:03,432 --> 00:12:04,599
<i>If that's true, then...</i>

188
00:12:10,689 --> 00:12:12,023
<i>Just stay out of this!</i>

189
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:17,237
Excuse me.

190
00:12:27,581 --> 00:12:28,707
<i>Just stay out of this!</i>

191
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:32,878
What's her problem?

192
00:12:44,181 --> 00:12:45,932
9:00 EVENT FINAL CHECK
11:00 ACTUAL EVENT

193
00:12:46,641 --> 00:12:48,226
<i>What do I do? At this rate...</i>

194
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:56,818
Is it the Shine Muscat proposal?

195
00:12:58,236 --> 00:12:59,070
Yeah.

196
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:02,824
Are you really rewriting all of it?

197
00:13:04,242 --> 00:13:07,704
Ms. Kanbe,
you can just focus on your own work.

198
00:13:09,664 --> 00:13:12,083
<i>There was no need to redo it.</i>

199
00:13:17,047 --> 00:13:18,131
I'll work on it with you.

200
00:13:18,632 --> 00:13:19,466
Huh?

201
00:13:19,925 --> 00:13:21,801
-But it'll take time.
-It's okay.

202
00:13:23,762 --> 00:13:25,680
-Then, start with this.
-Okay.

203
00:13:44,074 --> 00:13:45,075
Thanks.

204
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:54,167
<i>Even though we were exhausted</i>
<i>from being up all night doing overtime...</i>

205
00:13:55,585 --> 00:13:58,004
Nope. Do it again. Totally worthless.

206
00:13:58,088 --> 00:13:59,798
Redo it!

207
00:13:59,881 --> 00:14:01,675
{\an8}No good, redo it. Rejected!

208
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:14,396
<i>And because of that...</i>

209
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:20,694
INBOX - 1

210
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:23,363
FROM MOM
SORRY, I'LL BE THERE SOON

211
00:14:37,961 --> 00:14:40,880
KOSHIN SEMINAR

212
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:51,141
Ouch!

213
00:14:51,725 --> 00:14:52,601
<i>Ms. Sumiyoshi!</i>

214
00:14:52,684 --> 00:14:55,270
Sorry to leave everything
to you yesterday.

215
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:57,397
Was your daughter okay?

216
00:14:58,356 --> 00:15:00,525
When she fell,
she caught herself with her hand

217
00:15:00,609 --> 00:15:04,654
and ended up bruising her right arm
and breaking her pinky and ring finger.

218
00:15:07,324 --> 00:15:11,369
Ms. Kanbe, is what you sent this morning
the latest version?

219
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:13,913
Huh?

220
00:15:20,545 --> 00:15:23,673
I'm so sorry! I sent
the very first proposal by accident.

221
00:15:25,508 --> 00:15:27,260
Sumiyoshi, Kanbe!

222
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:33,516
I read it.

223
00:15:34,017 --> 00:15:36,186
My apologies, I sent the wrong data.

224
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:40,315
Thanks to my advice, you've finally
prepared a decent proposal!

225
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:43,693
Yeah, I'll call for the meeting.

226
00:16:03,838 --> 00:16:06,257
-There's no need to redo it.
-Huh?

227
00:16:06,341 --> 00:16:09,302
No need for overtime
or all-nighters either.

228
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:12,347
I understand how you feel, but...

229
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:14,224
The Section Chief hasn't read it.

230
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:17,394
He doesn't read the original proposals
or even the revisions.

231
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:20,105
He just skims through them
right before the meetings.

232
00:16:20,188 --> 00:16:21,022
Huh?

233
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:29,364
We don't have to let
some idiot boss push us around.

234
00:16:30,532 --> 00:16:32,283
Let's keep submitting the original,

235
00:16:32,367 --> 00:16:35,453
switching up the font, layout,
and order of the proposal.

236
00:16:35,537 --> 00:16:37,872
But if we're caught
doing something like that...

237
00:16:37,956 --> 00:16:39,165
I'll do it myself.

238
00:16:39,249 --> 00:16:41,126
Let's clock out on time this week.

239
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:43,503
It's not that simple.

240
00:16:43,586 --> 00:16:45,880
You have to get your daughter
from cram school.

241
00:16:45,964 --> 00:16:47,966
She's at an age
where she has a lot of energy.

242
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:50,176
With no one to watch her,
she could really get hurt.

243
00:16:51,469 --> 00:16:55,181
Ms. Sumiyoshi,
giving your time to a piece of trash

244
00:16:56,224 --> 00:16:57,976
is a total waste of your life.

245
00:17:06,901 --> 00:17:07,736
That's crazy!

246
00:17:08,445 --> 00:17:12,031
Section Chief Tomita is crazy,
but you two aren't far behind!

247
00:17:14,284 --> 00:17:18,246
I never would've guessed
Ms. Kanbe had such guts.

248
00:17:18,747 --> 00:17:21,207
You've got that straitlaced face,
like a timid lamb!

249
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:22,125
Come on.

250
00:17:23,001 --> 00:17:24,127
{\an8}SHINE MUSCAT PROPOSAL

251
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:25,086
{\an8}SHINE MUSCAT PROPOSAL

252
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,887
Sumiyoshi, Kanbe.

253
00:17:36,848 --> 00:17:38,600
Do you think I'm an idiot?

254
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:44,773
Didn't I tell you to turn in
this kind of proposal from the beginning?

255
00:17:46,107 --> 00:17:50,111
Thanks to my advice,
you've finally prepared a decent proposal.

256
00:17:53,698 --> 00:17:56,075
All right,
I'll call for the meeting. Yeah.

257
00:18:14,177 --> 00:18:18,473
Mommy, Daddy said you can
have some buttered potatoes, too.

258
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:19,891
-Huh?
-Thanks.

259
00:18:19,974 --> 00:18:22,310
-Please eat as much as you like!
-Thank you.

260
00:18:22,393 --> 00:18:23,978
This is all my treat today.

261
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:26,231
Thank you for the food!

262
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:33,947
Come to think of it,
was Section Chief Tomita's injury okay?

263
00:18:34,906 --> 00:18:38,952
Apparently, he bruised his right arm
and broke his pinky and ring finger.

264
00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:48,837
He had it coming.

265
00:18:51,047 --> 00:18:51,881
-So mean!
-So mean!

266
00:18:55,552 --> 00:18:57,929
Hey, Ms. Kanbe, thanks.

267
00:18:58,012 --> 00:19:00,598
I feel so much better.

268
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:06,062
-Okay, here.
-Thank you.

269
00:19:07,939 --> 00:19:11,150
<i>Ms. Sumiyoshi and I were the same.</i>

270
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:15,697
<i>Both of us were sacrificial lambs,</i>

271
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:18,449
<i>working with the belief that,</i>
<i>one day, we would be rewarded</i>

272
00:19:18,533 --> 00:19:20,493
<i>if we just stayed earnest and sincere.</i>

273
00:19:21,452 --> 00:19:23,997
<i>Stray lambs, with no one to watch over us.</i>

274
00:19:24,831 --> 00:19:26,541
<i>That's why we were devoured by hyenas.</i>

275
00:19:32,422 --> 00:19:34,841
<i>The Shine Muscat project</i>
<i>will get approved at the meeting.</i>

276
00:19:35,466 --> 00:19:38,469
<i>With Ms. Sumiyoshi as the leader,</i>
<i>development will progress smoothly.</i>

277
00:19:52,025 --> 00:19:54,360
SUZUTOYA
SHINE MUSCAT DAIFUKU

278
00:19:58,573 --> 00:20:02,201
<i>After Miku left the department,</i>
<i>the idea was commercialized,</i>

279
00:20:02,285 --> 00:20:04,871
<i>sales soared,</i>
<i>and it became a flagship product.</i>

280
00:20:05,413 --> 00:20:06,414
<i>But...</i>

281
00:20:06,497 --> 00:20:08,791
Let's go with the third one,
the peanut proposal.

282
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:10,376
<i>Everything was stolen.</i>

283
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:11,294
Write that down.

284
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:13,129
<i>By Section Chief Tomita and Reina.</i>

285
00:20:14,797 --> 00:20:18,384
<i>Tomita hijacked the project</i>
<i>after its massive success,</i>

286
00:20:18,468 --> 00:20:20,720
<i>kicked out both Ms. Sumiyoshi and I,</i>

287
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:23,431
<i>and handed it over to Reina.</i>

288
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:31,356
Yeah, yeah, well, please get some rest.

289
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:32,398
Okay, got it?

290
00:20:32,941 --> 00:20:33,858
Okay.

291
00:20:33,942 --> 00:20:37,320
<i>Ms. Sumiyoshi quit the company</i>
<i>due to physical and mental health issues.</i>

292
00:20:46,454 --> 00:20:47,455
ON LEAVE

293
00:20:47,538 --> 00:20:49,624
<i>I got cancer and took a leave of absence.</i>

294
00:20:49,707 --> 00:20:51,376
<i>And in my vacant post...</i>

295
00:21:02,553 --> 00:21:04,097
No more sheep!

296
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,140
Oh, sorry. You don't like mutton?

297
00:21:06,224 --> 00:21:09,060
We need to become hyenas.

298
00:21:09,143 --> 00:21:10,853
Oh no, she's drunk.

299
00:21:15,149 --> 00:21:17,193
-Let's eat.
-Let's eat!

300
00:21:18,695 --> 00:21:19,612
All right.

301
00:21:19,696 --> 00:21:21,239
It's done!

302
00:21:23,324 --> 00:21:25,660
-It's delicious!
-This is great!

303
00:21:25,743 --> 00:21:27,120
It's super delicious.

304
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:34,669
-The meat looks done, don't you think?
-It looks good.

305
00:21:52,145 --> 00:21:53,604
Sorry to keep you waiting, Reina

306
00:21:53,688 --> 00:21:54,814
No, not at all.

307
00:21:55,565 --> 00:21:59,902
Misa said she went drinking with the team.
She always used to turn them down.

308
00:22:00,403 --> 00:22:03,239
Yeah, I got rejected too.

309
00:22:04,741 --> 00:22:07,160
Something's off lately with Misa,
don't you think?

310
00:22:08,077 --> 00:22:09,037
Huh?

311
00:22:09,996 --> 00:22:10,955
Yeah.

312
00:22:12,582 --> 00:22:14,751
She seems unusually irritated.

313
00:22:15,084 --> 00:22:16,753
It's so weird.

314
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:20,298
Tomoya, you might want to be careful.

315
00:22:21,007 --> 00:22:22,467
What do you mean "be careful"?

316
00:22:23,384 --> 00:22:28,347
Some girls start having doubts
once the marriage is locked in

317
00:22:28,431 --> 00:22:30,266
like, "Is he really the right guy?"

318
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:31,601
No way...

319
00:22:32,143 --> 00:22:34,062
That can't be the case with Misa.

320
00:22:35,146 --> 00:22:36,564
Excuse me. A highball.

321
00:22:36,647 --> 00:22:37,482
Coming right up.

322
00:22:38,775 --> 00:22:41,402
You know Director Suzuki, the head
of Corporate Strategy?

323
00:22:41,486 --> 00:22:43,154
Yeah, the Noble Son?

324
00:22:43,237 --> 00:22:44,781
I wonder what kind of person he is.

325
00:22:45,114 --> 00:22:46,949
He's just a spoiled rich kid, right?

326
00:22:47,033 --> 00:22:49,160
Are there any rumors involving women?

327
00:22:49,243 --> 00:22:50,328
Not that I've heard.

328
00:22:50,411 --> 00:22:52,789
Come on, don't you have anything else?

329
00:22:53,706 --> 00:22:54,665
What?

330
00:22:55,124 --> 00:22:57,001
Reina, is someone like him your type?

331
00:22:57,627 --> 00:22:59,253
That's not it.

332
00:22:59,337 --> 00:23:01,672
The young girls in the department
want to know.

333
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:05,927
Apparently,
he studied plants at university.

334
00:23:06,761 --> 00:23:08,262
Maybe he's a science nerd?

335
00:23:08,846 --> 00:23:11,224
Maybe he's actually
not very experienced with women?

336
00:23:11,307 --> 00:23:12,725
That's probably true.

337
00:23:13,184 --> 00:23:15,436
He's such a straitlaced workaholic.

338
00:23:17,188 --> 00:23:19,190
I'm definitely better with women than him.

339
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:21,692
For guys, it's all about your charisma.

340
00:23:21,776 --> 00:23:27,156
He's got a wealthy family,
steady income, and won't cheat either.

341
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,866
A-grade husband material.

342
00:23:31,244 --> 00:23:32,245
Sorry for the wait.

343
00:23:33,287 --> 00:23:34,247
Thanks.

344
00:23:35,289 --> 00:23:37,416
Okay, Reina, cheers!

345
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,543
Cheers.

346
00:23:44,132 --> 00:23:46,676
And he may prove to be
a surprisingly easy target.

347
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:01,858
They look down on us
like we're just easy targets.

348
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:04,068
We need a plan to protect what's ours!

349
00:24:04,152 --> 00:24:04,986
-All right.
-All right.

350
00:24:05,069 --> 00:24:06,487
We need to lay the groundwork.

351
00:24:06,571 --> 00:24:08,698
And make alliances outside the department!

352
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:09,907
-All right.
-All right.

353
00:24:10,366 --> 00:24:13,536
Isn't it frustrating to be taken off
the Shine Muscat project

354
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:15,329
just when it was finally taking off?

355
00:24:15,413 --> 00:24:17,290
The proposal hasn't
even been approved yet.

356
00:24:17,373 --> 00:24:19,375
Isn't it a bit soon to worry about that?

357
00:24:20,418 --> 00:24:24,172
-Sorry, we're loud and smell like sheep.
-Sorry.

358
00:24:24,255 --> 00:24:26,257
It's fine,
there aren't any other customers.

359
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:27,175
That's right.

360
00:24:27,258 --> 00:24:28,926
Speaking of Shine Muscats,

361
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:30,845
do you know Ichinose Orchard in Nagano?

362
00:24:30,928 --> 00:24:32,555
-Yeah, it's famous.
-Really?

363
00:24:32,638 --> 00:24:33,514
Yes.

364
00:24:33,598 --> 00:24:36,142
They've gained a reputation
for their high quality,

365
00:24:36,767 --> 00:24:39,937
but they're so popular
that they can't accept any new contracts.

366
00:24:40,021 --> 00:24:42,815
Well, I don't think
that's actually the case.

367
00:24:42,899 --> 00:24:45,401
They were asking me
if I had any good contacts.

368
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:47,278
Huh? But when I talked to them...

369
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:50,114
What year is it now? 2015.

370
00:24:51,032 --> 00:24:52,700
We can get a contract with them now?

371
00:24:53,326 --> 00:24:55,119
This one's definitely drunk.

372
00:24:55,912 --> 00:24:57,705
I'm going to help with the next harvest.

373
00:24:57,788 --> 00:24:59,081
-Huh?
-Wanna come?

374
00:24:59,874 --> 00:25:00,708
Let's do it!

375
00:25:01,751 --> 00:25:05,087
All right, we'll move forward with
the Shine Muscat Project as discussed.

376
00:25:05,171 --> 00:25:06,839
-Let's begin.
-Let's begin.

377
00:25:07,256 --> 00:25:10,927
We'll sign on a popular orchard
and promote the project heavily online.

378
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:14,305
If we're quick, we can still
catch up with market competition.

379
00:25:14,388 --> 00:25:16,224
We've fallen behind other companies?

380
00:25:16,557 --> 00:25:18,559
I was talking to myself. Just ignore it.

381
00:25:19,143 --> 00:25:22,230
I'll get in touch with PR
about the social media campaign.

382
00:25:22,313 --> 00:25:24,232
Let's make it really Instagrammable.

383
00:25:24,315 --> 00:25:25,441
Instagrammable?

384
00:25:26,192 --> 00:25:27,026
No, I mean...

385
00:25:27,485 --> 00:25:28,569
Let's do our best.

386
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:32,490
I guess people aren't
saying <i>Instagrammable </i>yet.

387
00:25:37,495 --> 00:25:41,082
I'll try asking my colleagues for advice
to get more support.

388
00:25:41,666 --> 00:25:44,919
Okay. Let's use all of our connections
and everything else we can.

389
00:25:49,465 --> 00:25:50,299
Connections?

390
00:26:01,727 --> 00:26:04,063
{\an8}This is Reina Esaka.
Thank you for the other day.

391
00:26:12,029 --> 00:26:14,782
{\an8}I would like to thank you properly.
Could we meet sometime?

392
00:26:14,865 --> 00:26:16,534
{\an8}I'd like to get to know you better.

393
00:26:16,617 --> 00:26:17,451
{\an8}SEND

394
00:26:30,756 --> 00:26:31,590
Ah, hey...

395
00:26:43,227 --> 00:26:45,062
Don't call me at work.

396
00:26:46,439 --> 00:26:48,316
Sorry, sorry.

397
00:26:48,899 --> 00:26:50,651
I want you to bring my ring.

398
00:26:50,735 --> 00:26:53,821
I left it in the bathroom the other day
when I stayed over.

399
00:26:53,904 --> 00:26:55,114
Tell me on LINE.

400
00:26:55,197 --> 00:26:56,032
"Stayed over"?

401
00:26:57,033 --> 00:26:58,284
You'll just ignore me.

402
00:27:01,078 --> 00:27:02,038
This, right?

403
00:27:03,998 --> 00:27:07,168
I'm so happy! It's my favorite.

404
00:27:07,793 --> 00:27:09,962
Don't go forgetting things
people gave you.

405
00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:13,549
And next time you come over,
give me a heads-up first.

406
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:15,217
No way. Too much hassle.

407
00:27:15,676 --> 00:27:17,136
Then don't come over anymore.

408
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:18,721
What?

409
00:27:18,804 --> 00:27:20,306
But then you'd just ignore me.

410
00:27:20,389 --> 00:27:22,475
I shouldn't have given you the spare key.

411
00:27:22,892 --> 00:27:24,352
All right, get off. Let's go.

412
00:27:38,949 --> 00:27:40,159
What are you doing?

413
00:27:46,457 --> 00:27:47,792
Here is the isobeyaki set.

414
00:27:47,875 --> 00:27:49,418
-Thank you.
-Take your time.

415
00:27:53,214 --> 00:27:54,799
This is a good proposal.

416
00:27:55,549 --> 00:27:58,844
Shine Muscats have seen steady popularity
in recent years,

417
00:27:59,512 --> 00:28:01,639
and production is trending
upwards as well.

418
00:28:06,394 --> 00:28:08,938
TRENDS IN SHINE MUSCAT CULTIVATION AREA

419
00:28:09,021 --> 00:28:11,440
It's quadrupled over the past five years.

420
00:28:11,524 --> 00:28:14,151
Demand from overseas
is likely to increase in the future.

421
00:28:14,652 --> 00:28:16,862
You've really got
a sharp eye for opportunity.

422
00:28:18,989 --> 00:28:21,575
<i>And who have you got your eye on?</i>

423
00:28:21,659 --> 00:28:23,869
<i>Shacking up with a new hire</i>
<i>ten years younger?</i>

424
00:28:23,953 --> 00:28:26,914
<i>Or is it an on and off thing?</i>
<i>Just how fast do you run the bases?</i>

425
00:28:27,957 --> 00:28:28,791
<i>Wait a second.</i>

426
00:28:28,874 --> 00:28:30,376
-Is he your boyfriend?
-No, I'm not.

427
00:28:30,459 --> 00:28:32,837
-Oh, but you guys look great together.
-I'm not.

428
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,672
If I'm interrupting your date, maybe...

429
00:28:34,755 --> 00:28:36,215
I'm about to leave myself.

430
00:28:36,757 --> 00:28:38,050
<i>What was that even about?</i>

431
00:28:38,467 --> 00:28:39,510
<i>So freaky.</i>

432
00:28:40,594 --> 00:28:41,512
<i>Some kind of kink?</i>

433
00:28:41,595 --> 00:28:45,015
<i>Like a couple stuck in a rut</i>
<i>pulling in outsiders to spice things up?</i>

434
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:47,184
<i>You've sunk that low already?</i>

435
00:28:48,561 --> 00:28:49,395
Ms. Kanbe.

436
00:28:50,354 --> 00:28:51,188
What is it?

437
00:28:51,272 --> 00:28:55,234
You came to me with this project,
despite being from another department.

438
00:28:55,818 --> 00:28:57,862
Does that mean you want to use me?

439
00:29:01,198 --> 00:29:03,075
I know it's against the rules, but--

440
00:29:03,159 --> 00:29:04,201
Please use me.

441
00:29:04,869 --> 00:29:05,703
Huh?

442
00:29:11,542 --> 00:29:13,169
I see. I'd like to get to know you too.

443
00:29:13,252 --> 00:29:14,170
That's great!

444
00:29:19,675 --> 00:29:21,135
My apologies.

445
00:29:21,218 --> 00:29:23,262
I'll consider it further
with my department.

446
00:29:28,726 --> 00:29:30,186
-No, this is...
-Goodbye.

447
00:29:32,688 --> 00:29:33,522
Wait--

448
00:29:34,857 --> 00:29:37,610
Thank you very much.
Here's this back. Excuse me.

449
00:29:37,693 --> 00:29:38,694
No... Wait!

450
00:29:39,195 --> 00:29:41,322
Please wait up.

451
00:29:45,326 --> 00:29:46,952
He is garbage after all.

452
00:29:47,036 --> 00:29:50,372
The filthy Noble Son chasing
every skirt in the office!

453
00:29:53,375 --> 00:29:56,045
Hey, please let me explain.

454
00:30:13,229 --> 00:30:14,438
What do I do?

455
00:30:21,862 --> 00:30:26,325
It was so reassuring to have you there
when I needed someone.

456
00:30:31,288 --> 00:30:32,957
Please let me contact you again.

457
00:30:33,749 --> 00:30:34,959
At this rate...

458
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,131
Not gonna happen!

459
00:30:43,676 --> 00:30:45,094
Morning, Misa.

460
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,013
What's not gonna happen?

461
00:30:48,514 --> 00:30:50,057
Huh? What are you doing?

462
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:52,309
You've been ignoring me lately.

463
00:30:52,393 --> 00:30:55,229
You can't just come in here uninvited.

464
00:30:55,312 --> 00:30:58,357
You're the one who gave me a spare key
and said I could come over anytime.

465
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:06,699
I told you I'm busy with
the Shine Muscat project launch, didn't I?

466
00:31:06,782 --> 00:31:07,992
Yeah, that.

467
00:31:09,201 --> 00:31:10,703
I'm in charge of sales now.

468
00:31:11,745 --> 00:31:12,663
I know.

469
00:31:12,746 --> 00:31:14,164
<i>It's the same as the first time.</i>

470
00:31:14,248 --> 00:31:16,375
You'll be at the farm
in Nagano tomorrow, right?

471
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:17,543
Why do you know that?

472
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:19,378
I heard it from Reina.

473
00:31:20,921 --> 00:31:22,172
When did you...

474
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:24,425
I'm going with you.

475
00:31:24,508 --> 00:31:27,553
No, no... Tomorrow's trip
is just for preliminary research.

476
00:31:27,636 --> 00:31:30,264
Come on, I'm part of the team too.

477
00:31:30,347 --> 00:31:33,350
Oh, I heard the director
of Corporate Strategy is coming too.

478
00:31:33,934 --> 00:31:35,019
Director Suzuki?

479
00:31:35,102 --> 00:31:38,063
Yeah. Reina said she invited him.

480
00:31:40,649 --> 00:31:41,650
<i>Not good!</i>

481
00:31:41,734 --> 00:31:43,944
<i>Even if Director Suzuki's</i>
<i>a total sleaze with women,</i>

482
00:31:44,028 --> 00:31:45,863
<i>Tomoya still doesn't stand a chance.</i>

483
00:31:47,698 --> 00:31:48,574
Tomoya.

484
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:51,910
Let's go shopping.

485
00:31:53,162 --> 00:31:56,081
The other day, you ruined
your favorite shirt with curry, right?

486
00:31:56,165 --> 00:31:58,459
I'll buy you some cool clothes
for tomorrow.

487
00:31:58,876 --> 00:32:01,253
What's the point of dressing up
to go to a farm?

488
00:32:02,588 --> 00:32:05,382
I want to brag about
how cool you look to everyone.

489
00:32:07,801 --> 00:32:10,012
Women trying to one-up each other, huh?

490
00:32:10,471 --> 00:32:12,348
You can be so needy at times!

491
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:26,403
<i>At the very least,</i>
<i>I need to make him look like Reina's type.</i>

492
00:32:43,545 --> 00:32:44,922
Oh, I look good.

493
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:47,174
<i>It's no use.</i>

494
00:32:47,675 --> 00:32:49,843
<i>The narcissist</i>
<i>is coming out in full force.</i>

495
00:32:49,927 --> 00:32:52,680
<i>Isn't there a way for him</i>
<i>to look effortlessly charming?</i>

496
00:32:52,763 --> 00:32:53,597
<i>Like...</i>

497
00:33:10,948 --> 00:33:12,533
<i>Huh? Director Suzuki?</i>

498
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,660
<i>Those two are dating already?</i>

499
00:33:15,953 --> 00:33:16,829
Tomoya.

500
00:33:17,204 --> 00:33:19,081
-Huh?
-Let's go to another store.

501
00:33:24,795 --> 00:33:26,004
Misa, check it out!

502
00:33:28,507 --> 00:33:30,134
What are you looking at, Misa?

503
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:31,844
Misa!

504
00:33:37,433 --> 00:33:38,934
Misa, how's this?

505
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:39,852
Oh, yeah.

506
00:33:45,107 --> 00:33:46,024
Misa.

507
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:49,027
-What do you think?
-Yeah, that's good enough.

508
00:33:49,111 --> 00:33:51,321
What do you mean, "that's good enough"?

509
00:33:54,324 --> 00:33:56,410
Okay, wear this for tomorrow.

510
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,002
I'm going to stay at your place tonight.

511
00:34:05,294 --> 00:34:06,128
Huh?

512
00:34:06,628 --> 00:34:09,047
We're going there together
tomorrow anyway.

513
00:34:10,674 --> 00:34:12,760
I have plans for later, so...

514
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:15,053
Plans?

515
00:34:16,096 --> 00:34:17,556
What plans do you have later?

516
00:34:20,726 --> 00:34:23,687
Plans that don't involve you, Tomoya.

517
00:34:25,481 --> 00:34:26,440
Huh?

518
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:30,027
Plans you can't even tell your fiancé?

519
00:34:30,819 --> 00:34:32,237
Isn't that strange?

520
00:34:33,781 --> 00:34:35,616
It obviously doesn't make any sense.

521
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,744
We're supposed to be together
for life from now on,

522
00:34:38,827 --> 00:34:40,621
so what's with all the selfishness?

523
00:34:41,622 --> 00:34:45,292
You said you wanted to go shopping,
and I spent all day with you, right?

524
00:34:45,375 --> 00:34:48,086
So where do you get off putting
other plans over me?

525
00:34:48,170 --> 00:34:49,421
Do you even care how others feel?

526
00:34:49,505 --> 00:34:52,925
I'm letting it slide 'cause I'm nice,
but any other guy would've lost it by now!

527
00:34:58,639 --> 00:34:59,473
Let's go.

528
00:35:00,933 --> 00:35:01,850
Let go of me!

529
00:35:10,025 --> 00:35:11,360
I can be selfish if I want.

530
00:35:12,277 --> 00:35:13,487
My life...

531
00:35:14,655 --> 00:35:16,782
doesn't revolve around you, Tomoya.

532
00:35:26,875 --> 00:35:28,544
Thanks for today.

533
00:35:29,753 --> 00:35:33,298
Reina, I'm really sorry for hurting you.

534
00:35:33,882 --> 00:35:36,844
But I never lied about my love for you.

535
00:35:51,817 --> 00:35:53,110
I want this to be the end.

536
00:35:53,861 --> 00:35:54,903
The end?

537
00:35:55,654 --> 00:36:00,033
Yeah. Don't go after my company,
my parents, or my girlfriend's family!

538
00:36:00,117 --> 00:36:01,410
It's all my fault, okay?

539
00:36:01,827 --> 00:36:03,203
They didn't do anything!

540
00:36:06,456 --> 00:36:08,041
You're acting so arrogant

541
00:36:08,125 --> 00:36:10,294
for someone who should
be begging for mercy.

542
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:16,758
I'm so sorry!

543
00:36:16,842 --> 00:36:18,802
Please forgive me!

544
00:36:19,845 --> 00:36:20,888
I knew it all along.

545
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:28,478
The guys who come after me are all losers.

546
00:36:44,244 --> 00:36:46,747
<i>I never liked it</i>
<i>when others were in a bad mood.</i>

547
00:36:47,247 --> 00:36:48,206
<i>I'm home!</i>

548
00:36:49,082 --> 00:36:51,627
<i>Number seven, Ebisu Lite O,</i>
<i>takes the lead!</i>

549
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:52,794
Mom, today...

550
00:36:52,878 --> 00:36:54,254
Could you just shut up?

551
00:36:54,963 --> 00:36:56,548
<i>They have passed the 400.</i>

552
00:36:57,674 --> 00:37:00,385
Damn it, I can't believe this.
Seriously...

553
00:37:01,011 --> 00:37:03,430
<i>Number one, Kitashiba Spain,</i>
<i>is fast approaching!</i>

554
00:37:03,513 --> 00:37:05,265
<i>They're coming around the final curve!</i>

555
00:37:05,349 --> 00:37:06,725
<i>He's staying wide!</i>

556
00:37:06,808 --> 00:37:09,603
<i>Ebisu Lite O stays wide,</i>
<i>but maintains the lead!</i>

557
00:37:09,686 --> 00:37:12,731
<i>Number one, Kitashiba Spain,</i>
<i>pulls into second place!</i>

558
00:37:12,814 --> 00:37:15,776
<i>Number ten, Marine Jet,</i>
<i>falls back to third!</i>

559
00:37:15,859 --> 00:37:19,112
<i>Ebisu Lite O and Kitashiba Spain</i>
<i>are neck and neck!</i>

560
00:37:19,196 --> 00:37:21,573
<i>Ebisu Lite O wins! Kitashiba Spain...</i>

561
00:37:21,657 --> 00:37:23,116
<i>I instantly go pale.</i>

562
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,868
<i>I panic and try to read their face.</i>

563
00:37:24,952 --> 00:37:27,329
Is a presentation
the place to air your delusions?

564
00:37:27,412 --> 00:37:29,539
Your recklessness just caused a huge loss!

565
00:37:29,623 --> 00:37:30,832
I'm very sorry.

566
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:33,752
<i>I always feel like</i>
<i>I need to keep the peace.</i>

567
00:37:56,817 --> 00:37:58,860
<i>What was I so afraid of?</i>

568
00:38:00,362 --> 00:38:02,906
<i>So what if they hate me</i>
<i>or hit me or whatever?</i>

569
00:38:04,241 --> 00:38:06,994
I've already been killed once.

570
00:38:42,446 --> 00:38:44,364
-Get in.
-Huh? I'm fine in the back.

571
00:38:44,448 --> 00:38:45,490
It's fine, let's go!

572
00:38:46,074 --> 00:38:46,908
What?

573
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:52,891
Nice view, isn't it?

574
00:39:52,974 --> 00:39:53,850
Yeah.

575
00:39:58,021 --> 00:39:59,856
Did Miku contact you?

576
00:40:00,524 --> 00:40:03,777
I asked her to come with us,
but she said she already had a ride.

577
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:04,778
Okay.

578
00:40:21,962 --> 00:40:23,839
We're here!

579
00:40:31,179 --> 00:40:32,013
Thanks.

580
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:34,391
Didn't I tell you to go by train?

581
00:40:34,474 --> 00:40:36,852
Oh, come on!
We're going to the same place.

582
00:40:36,935 --> 00:40:40,272
-Coming here together...
-I swear I won't tell anyone!

583
00:40:40,355 --> 00:40:42,440
I'll go first. Come a little later, okay?

584
00:40:53,827 --> 00:40:54,953
Heave-ho.

585
00:41:09,551 --> 00:41:10,635
Reina, are you okay?

586
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:12,304
Sorry.

587
00:41:12,971 --> 00:41:14,055
Please sit down.

588
00:41:15,056 --> 00:41:16,308
Thank you.

589
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:25,859
Here, Reina, a sports drink.

590
00:41:25,942 --> 00:41:27,611
Would you like some tea?

591
00:41:27,694 --> 00:41:28,528
No, thank you.

592
00:41:31,823 --> 00:41:33,617
He's being completely ignored.

593
00:41:34,618 --> 00:41:36,453
Come on, try harder!

594
00:41:37,537 --> 00:41:39,539
-Are you tired?
-Not really.

595
00:41:40,373 --> 00:41:41,791
It's a nice change of pace

596
00:41:41,875 --> 00:41:44,127
-from being stuck at the office, right?
-Yeah.

597
00:41:44,211 --> 00:41:46,504
Being around so much nature
is really calming.

598
00:41:46,588 --> 00:41:47,505
Yeah.

599
00:41:47,589 --> 00:41:51,384
Oh yeah, back in freshman year,
during the school's carrot harvest, I...

600
00:41:51,468 --> 00:41:55,722
Misa and Yuto
were each other's first crushes.

601
00:41:55,805 --> 00:41:58,767
-Kinda bittersweet, isn't it?
-You fell big-time!

602
00:41:59,392 --> 00:42:01,061
That brings me back!

603
00:42:01,144 --> 00:42:05,899
They reconnected recently at the reunion
and seem to be getting close again.

604
00:42:05,982 --> 00:42:08,401
-You were a mess.
-But you came and helped me.

605
00:42:08,485 --> 00:42:11,446
Well, I wouldn't say I helped much,
but what a great memory.

606
00:42:14,449 --> 00:42:17,619
Thank you all so much
for helping out today.

607
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:20,497
We've gathered
some delicious local vegetables,

608
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:22,165
so please eat to your heart's content!

609
00:42:22,249 --> 00:42:24,376
-Thank you!
-Thank you!

610
00:42:24,459 --> 00:42:26,544
Please leave the rest of the work to me.

611
00:42:26,628 --> 00:42:27,712
Everyone, please relax.

612
00:42:29,464 --> 00:42:30,382
I can't wait!

613
00:42:49,818 --> 00:42:50,735
Amazing!

614
00:42:59,869 --> 00:43:00,829
I'll do it.

615
00:43:00,912 --> 00:43:02,163
Thank you.

616
00:43:12,132 --> 00:43:13,550
<i>Could this be...</i>

617
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,142
<i>Is he trying to impress Reina?</i>

618
00:43:23,435 --> 00:43:25,478
-Misa, let's cook the meat together.
-Okay.

619
00:43:25,562 --> 00:43:26,688
Over here, come on.

620
00:43:28,815 --> 00:43:29,816
Shall we cook these?

621
00:43:29,899 --> 00:43:30,984
-These?
-Yeah.

622
00:43:31,067 --> 00:43:32,444
Is pork okay?

623
00:43:32,527 --> 00:43:34,821
That's fine.
Doesn't it look fantastic?

624
00:43:35,363 --> 00:43:37,407
Are you okay? All right.

625
00:43:43,330 --> 00:43:46,333
Now then, why don't we have a toast,
Director Suzuki?

626
00:43:46,708 --> 00:43:48,918
No, Ms. Sumiyoshi, please.

627
00:43:49,836 --> 00:43:50,795
Okay, then.

628
00:43:50,879 --> 00:43:53,298
To the success
of the Shine Muscat project...

629
00:43:53,757 --> 00:43:57,135
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

630
00:43:58,762 --> 00:44:02,140
And here's to a happy marriage
for Misa and Tomoya!

631
00:44:04,684 --> 00:44:05,935
Hey, Reina...

632
00:44:07,437 --> 00:44:08,271
What...

633
00:44:09,397 --> 00:44:11,483
Nobody knew?

634
00:44:12,317 --> 00:44:14,235
You've been out drinking a lot lately,

635
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:16,696
so I thought you would've told them
about the engagement.

636
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:17,655
Engagement?

637
00:44:18,573 --> 00:44:19,574
Sorry.

638
00:44:20,075 --> 00:44:22,077
But it's fine, right, Misa?

639
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:23,787
Since we're all among friends.

640
00:44:26,122 --> 00:44:29,376
As her friend,
I've always worried about her.

641
00:44:29,459 --> 00:44:33,004
Misa's such a good person, but somehow
she never could find the right match.

642
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:39,344
That's why I'm so truly happy
she ended up with Tomoya.

643
00:44:40,428 --> 00:44:42,806
Jeez, Reina, you really
jumped the gun here.

644
00:44:43,348 --> 00:44:45,392
Please keep it a secret at work for now.

645
00:44:45,475 --> 00:44:46,935
Oh, is that so?

646
00:44:47,727 --> 00:44:48,812
Congratulations.

647
00:44:49,646 --> 00:44:50,772
Thank you!

648
00:44:50,855 --> 00:44:52,315
Come on, Misa, you stand too!

649
00:44:55,026 --> 00:44:57,028
To the most perfect match ever!

650
00:44:57,112 --> 00:44:58,696
Cheers!

651
00:44:59,072 --> 00:44:59,989
Cheers!

652
00:45:00,073 --> 00:45:01,199
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

653
00:45:02,242 --> 00:45:03,451
Thank you!

654
00:45:03,868 --> 00:45:05,078
Thank you.

655
00:45:05,161 --> 00:45:05,995
Misa, cheers!

656
00:45:09,416 --> 00:45:11,501
Since you love meat,
I'll get you some, Misa.

657
00:45:11,584 --> 00:45:12,710
Delicious!

658
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:15,713
All right.

659
00:45:15,797 --> 00:45:16,798
Here you go!

660
00:45:16,881 --> 00:45:17,715
Thanks.

661
00:45:19,801 --> 00:45:21,636
I'll have some meat too!

662
00:45:27,434 --> 00:45:28,268
<i>What?</i>

663
00:45:29,561 --> 00:45:32,105
I'll get some too.

664
00:45:58,548 --> 00:45:59,591
I'm okay here.

665
00:45:59,674 --> 00:46:01,885
-Please just enjoy your meal over there.
-No.

666
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:03,845
It's okay.

667
00:46:05,638 --> 00:46:07,307
I'm fine here, really.

668
00:46:07,390 --> 00:46:08,433
No...

669
00:46:09,225 --> 00:46:10,310
It's okay.

670
00:46:14,689 --> 00:46:17,775
Director, why did you come today?

671
00:46:19,277 --> 00:46:20,111
Why?

672
00:46:20,195 --> 00:46:21,070
Were you bored?

673
00:46:23,156 --> 00:46:24,741
No, I wasn't bored.

674
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:27,494
Why are you in such a bad mood?

675
00:46:28,453 --> 00:46:30,163
I'm in a bad mood?

676
00:46:30,246 --> 00:46:33,750
Sometimes, I even detect
hostility and contempt.

677
00:46:36,503 --> 00:46:38,713
I want to know
the reason why you're angry.

678
00:46:38,796 --> 00:46:40,381
I'm not angry at all.

679
00:46:41,508 --> 00:46:44,177
If anything, aren't you the one
in a bad mood, Director?

680
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:46,846
I felt some really tense vibes
from you back there.

681
00:46:46,930 --> 00:46:49,599
Casting your shadow over us
all at the table like that...

682
00:46:49,682 --> 00:46:53,102
Are you... in love with Tomoya Hirano?

683
00:46:55,772 --> 00:46:58,816
That's... not a conversation
I should have with my superior...

684
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:00,860
Are you really going through
with the marriage?

685
00:47:05,031 --> 00:47:06,157
Well...

686
00:47:06,241 --> 00:47:07,492
-Yes?
-Well!

687
00:47:07,951 --> 00:47:08,785
Yes?

688
00:47:09,327 --> 00:47:11,037
Could you just stop it already?

689
00:47:12,038 --> 00:47:14,332
Who I marry is my own business.

690
00:47:14,415 --> 00:47:16,960
If you have nothing better to do, then...

691
00:47:17,710 --> 00:47:19,879
please take better care of Miku!

692
00:47:20,922 --> 00:47:21,756
Miku?

693
00:47:22,507 --> 00:47:25,176
I know that the two of you are dating.

694
00:47:26,511 --> 00:47:27,345
Huh?

695
00:47:27,428 --> 00:47:28,972
Just how much of a scumbag are you?

696
00:47:29,055 --> 00:47:30,848
Going after every woman
in reach at the office.

697
00:47:30,932 --> 00:47:33,601
Am I the third?
Fourth? Fifth, sixth, seventh?

698
00:47:33,685 --> 00:47:35,645
-How many are there, really?
-Please calm down.

699
00:47:35,728 --> 00:47:38,690
Stop chasing after women
and please just do your job properly.

700
00:47:38,773 --> 00:47:40,191
If you keep this up,

701
00:47:40,275 --> 00:47:42,569
then you're nothing
but a filthy, perverted hyena!

702
00:47:44,654 --> 00:47:46,072
What are you doing?

703
00:47:47,115 --> 00:47:48,866
You did it to yourself.

704
00:47:51,744 --> 00:47:53,121
How sleazy can you be?

705
00:47:53,204 --> 00:47:54,539
You brought your girlfriend,

706
00:47:54,622 --> 00:47:57,166
but tell her to be quiet
so you can hit on other girls?

707
00:47:57,250 --> 00:47:58,459
How dumb do you think we are?

708
00:47:58,543 --> 00:47:59,544
She's my little sister.

709
00:48:00,003 --> 00:48:00,837
Huh?

710
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:03,131
Miku is my little sister.

711
00:48:03,631 --> 00:48:05,508
You know Miku's last name, don't you?

712
00:48:06,801 --> 00:48:10,263
Miku Suzuki... Huh?

713
00:48:12,223 --> 00:48:14,017
The reason we hid the relationship

714
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:17,687
is because people inside the company
don't know that she is the CEO's daughter.

715
00:48:18,271 --> 00:48:21,899
I don't want her to get any special
treatment until she can pull her weight.

716
00:48:35,455 --> 00:48:39,292
Is there anything else I can explain?

717
00:48:41,794 --> 00:48:45,673
But didn't you and Reina go on a date
in Yokohama yesterday?

718
00:48:45,757 --> 00:48:48,134
-Date?
-I saw it on Reina's Insta.

719
00:48:49,135 --> 00:48:51,929
Was that... really me?

720
00:48:53,765 --> 00:48:56,768
Incidentally, I was on a business trip
to Taiwan yesterday.

721
00:48:57,185 --> 00:48:59,812
Should I show you proof of that too?

722
00:49:05,735 --> 00:49:06,611
Ms. Kanbe.

723
00:49:08,112 --> 00:49:10,865
What was it you called me just before?

724
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:11,783
That's right...

725
00:49:12,742 --> 00:49:15,203
"a filthy, perverted hyena?"

726
00:49:15,662 --> 00:49:16,913
Was that it?

727
00:49:19,207 --> 00:49:22,126
Isn't there something else
you ought to say to me now?

728
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:24,962
I'm so sorry!

729
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:32,178
I'm glad.

730
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:36,057
As long as you don't hate me.

731
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:37,183
Of course not!

732
00:49:37,975 --> 00:49:40,812
I'm sorry. I don't even know
how I should apologize.

733
00:49:43,022 --> 00:49:46,984
Can I have
just five minutes of your time?

734
00:50:04,752 --> 00:50:09,590
Do you know the proper way
to eat a Shine Muscat?

735
00:50:10,216 --> 00:50:11,884
Is there such a thing?

736
00:50:11,968 --> 00:50:14,303
Each and every grape
has a different flavor.

737
00:50:19,183 --> 00:50:23,354
The part that first receives nutrients
from the tree is this part.

738
00:50:23,813 --> 00:50:26,190
The top is the sweetest.

739
00:50:26,274 --> 00:50:28,568
Wow. Even though this is my job,

740
00:50:28,651 --> 00:50:30,611
I'm embarrassed
to admit I didn't know that.

741
00:50:30,695 --> 00:50:36,743
So... if you eat from the top first,
it starts out extremely sweet,

742
00:50:36,826 --> 00:50:40,288
but the sweetness gradually fades
the further you go.

743
00:50:42,749 --> 00:50:46,252
Somehow... it's like love, isn't it?

744
00:50:47,795 --> 00:50:48,880
Was yours like that?

745
00:50:55,261 --> 00:50:57,138
I recommend starting from the bottom.

746
00:50:57,722 --> 00:50:58,973
It's light at first.

747
00:50:59,056 --> 00:51:03,936
But as you keep eating,
the sweetness gets stronger and stronger.

748
00:51:05,772 --> 00:51:08,691
That kind of love might exist as well.

749
00:51:10,485 --> 00:51:12,487
Life is long, after all.

750
00:51:19,202 --> 00:51:20,995
Would you like to try comparing flavors?

751
00:51:23,372 --> 00:51:24,207
Sure.

752
00:51:30,671 --> 00:51:31,964
It's refreshing and delicious.

753
00:51:34,175 --> 00:51:36,385
Then, next is...

754
00:51:38,763 --> 00:51:40,139
the top part.

755
00:51:49,065 --> 00:51:50,024
Huh?

756
00:51:50,566 --> 00:51:52,777
It's totally, wow! It's totally different!

757
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:53,820
Right?

758
00:51:53,903 --> 00:51:54,946
It's sweet!

759
00:51:55,696 --> 00:51:57,031
It's so different!

760
00:51:58,115 --> 00:51:59,450
Amazing!

761
00:52:05,456 --> 00:52:06,499
I'm glad...

762
00:52:09,794 --> 00:52:11,379
that you're well.

763
00:52:12,505 --> 00:52:13,506
I mean it.

764
00:53:01,804 --> 00:53:03,556
Director, please eat some too.

765
00:53:03,639 --> 00:53:04,765
Well then...

766
00:53:07,310 --> 00:53:08,144
Delicious.

767
00:53:08,227 --> 00:53:09,645
-It's so good!
-Yes.

768
00:53:09,729 --> 00:53:11,397
Which part did you like the most?

769
00:53:12,398 --> 00:53:13,482
Well...

770
00:53:14,692 --> 00:53:17,737
-The top one surprised me so much.
-Yeah.

771
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:18,821
I was like, "Whoa, sweet!"

772
00:53:18,905 --> 00:53:21,073
Then go ahead, have one more from the top.

773
00:53:21,157 --> 00:53:22,199
-May I?
-Of course.

774
00:53:22,283 --> 00:53:23,326
Director, you too.

775
00:53:23,409 --> 00:53:25,620
-They're incredible.
-Then I'll take one from here.

776
00:53:25,703 --> 00:53:26,954
Thank you for having us.

777
00:53:27,038 --> 00:53:28,539
No, no, likewise.

778
00:53:28,623 --> 00:53:31,250
We would be happy
to work with Suzutoya as well.

779
00:53:32,251 --> 00:53:33,461
That would be great!

780
00:53:33,544 --> 00:53:35,796
We will contact you again soon.

781
00:53:36,213 --> 00:53:39,091
I'm helping out tomorrow too,
so I'll see you at the cafe.

782
00:53:39,175 --> 00:53:41,427
Okay. Thanks, Tanabe.

783
00:53:42,345 --> 00:53:43,721
Well then, thank you so much.

784
00:53:43,804 --> 00:53:45,431
-Thank you very much.
-Thank you very much.

785
00:53:45,514 --> 00:53:46,807
-See you later.
-See you.

786
00:53:47,099 --> 00:53:48,142
Miku! Over here, over here!

787
00:53:48,225 --> 00:53:49,060
Okay!

788
00:53:49,143 --> 00:53:50,394
-All right, shall we go?
-Sure.

789
00:53:51,604 --> 00:53:53,022
Reina, are you all right?

790
00:53:53,105 --> 00:53:54,982
-Does your ankle hurt again?
-Hey...

791
00:53:57,568 --> 00:53:59,528
Can I ride with you on the way back?

792
00:54:00,821 --> 00:54:02,740
I want to talk to you about something.

793
00:54:07,244 --> 00:54:08,663
You can put it in the trunk.

794
00:54:16,629 --> 00:54:18,673
This is getting on my nerves...

795
00:54:19,674 --> 00:54:21,884
Hurry it up, Director.

796
00:54:26,222 --> 00:54:27,264
Misa, tea!

797
00:54:33,437 --> 00:54:35,940
<i>What is this strange feeling?</i>

798
00:54:37,733 --> 00:54:40,861
<i>It's all tingly around here but warm.</i>

799
00:54:41,278 --> 00:54:43,990
<i>It's something I haven't felt in ages.</i>

800
00:54:46,575 --> 00:54:48,953
I'm not the stalker or noble son
you might think I am, but...

801
00:54:49,036 --> 00:54:51,789
I can at least put an umbrella over you.

802
00:54:53,416 --> 00:54:56,419
I'm glad... that you're well.

803
00:54:57,336 --> 00:54:58,337
I mean it.

804
00:55:00,256 --> 00:55:02,633
<i>Could this be...</i>

805
00:55:10,975 --> 00:55:12,852
Let me know if you get thirsty, okay?

806
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:14,770
If you get a little hungry...

807
00:55:15,229 --> 00:55:16,981
I'll pop some snacks in your mouth.

808
00:55:17,064 --> 00:55:18,607
Don't trouble yourself.

809
00:55:21,235 --> 00:55:23,404
You're from Toyama, right?

810
00:55:23,904 --> 00:55:24,739
Yes.

811
00:55:25,406 --> 00:55:26,824
When did you meet Ms. Kanbe?

812
00:55:27,992 --> 00:55:31,829
We met in second grade,
and we've been friends ever since.

813
00:55:32,455 --> 00:55:33,622
Misa's mom...

814
00:55:38,085 --> 00:55:40,504
Her mom left the house with another man.

815
00:55:41,047 --> 00:55:42,256
Our relationship started

816
00:55:42,339 --> 00:55:44,592
when Misa was depressed
and I cheered her up.

817
00:55:45,676 --> 00:55:49,096
Around the same time,
my mom also passed away.

818
00:55:50,389 --> 00:55:53,434
But I couldn't tell Misa.

819
00:55:56,645 --> 00:55:59,648
Director, your mother
passed away too, right?

820
00:56:01,108 --> 00:56:02,359
I understand the feeling.

821
00:56:03,652 --> 00:56:06,614
I have a tendency
to keep things to myself.

822
00:56:07,990 --> 00:56:09,784
I've always been a bit clumsy.

823
00:56:10,659 --> 00:56:12,578
With the Shine Muscat project too.

824
00:56:12,661 --> 00:56:15,331
When I said,
"How about something like this?"

825
00:56:15,414 --> 00:56:18,501
it was Misa who skillfully turned it
into a proper proposal...

826
00:56:19,752 --> 00:56:20,836
I see.

827
00:56:21,921 --> 00:56:25,091
Misa is smart and friendly with everyone.

828
00:56:25,174 --> 00:56:29,011
Even today, she was getting along
with Yuto in front of Tomoya.

829
00:56:29,845 --> 00:56:31,514
I don't mean anything bad by it.

830
00:56:32,014 --> 00:56:34,141
Wanting to be loved by lots of people...

831
00:56:34,642 --> 00:56:36,477
I don't think that's a bad thing.

832
00:56:40,564 --> 00:56:43,651
I always end up losing confidence.

833
00:56:45,528 --> 00:56:48,405
Like, compared to Misa, I'm...

834
00:56:51,659 --> 00:56:56,080
Even my boyfriend, who I really trusted,
betrayed and abandoned me.

835
00:56:58,958 --> 00:57:01,001
Sorry. I didn't mean to vent like this.

836
00:57:04,255 --> 00:57:05,214
In the end...

837
00:57:07,883 --> 00:57:11,345
no matter where I go,
I'm always all alone.

838
00:57:17,643 --> 00:57:18,978
Ms. Esaka.

839
00:57:20,729 --> 00:57:23,023
You and Ms. Kanbe are best friends, right?

840
00:57:24,275 --> 00:57:26,318
Huh? Yes.

841
00:57:26,402 --> 00:57:27,570
So have you always

842
00:57:28,863 --> 00:57:32,032
bad-mouthed your best friend like that
when she's not around?

843
00:57:35,286 --> 00:57:36,412
What? I never--

844
00:57:36,495 --> 00:57:39,999
Ms. Esaka, are you interested in me?

845
00:57:41,542 --> 00:57:45,129
Because I find everything
you say and do unpleasant.

846
00:57:48,549 --> 00:57:50,259
You should remember this.

847
00:57:51,719 --> 00:57:56,599
People who tear others down without
remorse always get theirs in the end.

848
00:58:01,645 --> 00:58:04,815
Didn't you say you
wanted to get to know me?

849
00:58:04,899 --> 00:58:05,733
Yes.

850
00:58:06,150 --> 00:58:07,985
And today, I've learned plenty.

851
00:58:08,861 --> 00:58:10,738
You were dumped by your boyfriend?

852
00:58:11,655 --> 00:58:13,949
I doubt any man
would ever genuinely want

853
00:58:14,909 --> 00:58:18,370
to bring happiness
to a heart as rotten as yours.

854
00:58:21,624 --> 00:58:25,502
You intentionally dropped 50 chocolates

855
00:58:26,086 --> 00:58:28,714
from the top of the stairs
and damaged them.

856
00:58:31,634 --> 00:58:34,220
Please make sure
to properly compensate the company.

857
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:49,818
What?

858
00:58:49,902 --> 00:58:50,736
Huh?

859
00:58:54,990 --> 00:58:56,784
So you don't need a ride anymore?

860
00:58:57,534 --> 00:58:59,578
What did I do to deserve all that?

861
00:58:59,662 --> 00:59:01,705
What do you know about me anyway?

862
00:59:03,165 --> 00:59:04,208
Your ankle...

863
00:59:05,626 --> 00:59:07,836
It's almost as if nothing happened at all.

864
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:14,885
What's going on with them?

865
00:59:15,427 --> 00:59:16,470
A fight?

866
00:59:16,553 --> 00:59:17,888
That's unusual.

867
00:59:33,112 --> 00:59:33,946
Huh?

868
00:59:44,373 --> 00:59:46,250
You asshole!
