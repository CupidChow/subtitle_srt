1
00:00:14,223 --> 00:00:15,057
sorry

2
00:00:31,407 --> 00:00:32,533
Are you okay?

3
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:34,744
Thank you

4
00:00:37,246 --> 00:00:38,122
sorry

5
00:00:38,998 --> 00:00:41,000
I accidentally tripped on the stairs

6
00:00:43,294 --> 00:00:45,212
Are you Minister Suzuki?

7
00:00:45,296 --> 00:00:47,173
I'm Jiangsaka from Planning Department 2

8
00:00:48,966 --> 00:00:49,925
I am Suzuki

9
00:00:52,553 --> 00:00:53,471
Thank you

10
00:00:58,601 --> 00:01:02,104
I think I twisted my foot accidentally.

11
00:01:14,325 --> 00:01:15,159
Huh?

12
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:16,410
Beautiful yarn?

13
00:01:18,496 --> 00:01:20,206
-morning
-Good morning

14
00:01:20,289 --> 00:01:21,624
Good morning

15
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:24,585
Kobe always thinks you are so cute today

16
00:01:25,002 --> 00:01:26,670
Would it be too eye-catching to wear this to work?

17
00:01:26,754 --> 00:01:28,798
- No, it's okay.
-Really?

18
00:01:28,881 --> 00:01:31,008
You really suit bright colors.

19
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:32,259
Misaya

20
00:01:32,343 --> 00:01:34,512
-Did you get your hair cut?
-How about the class reunion?

21
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:35,679
Do you want to listen?

22
00:01:35,763 --> 00:01:36,847
-Did you cut it short?
- I want to hear

23
00:01:44,355 --> 00:01:46,232
Jiang Ban hasn't joined the company yet

24
00:01:46,816 --> 00:01:48,025
Does anyone know why?

25
00:01:56,033 --> 00:01:58,077
Come to Sumiyoshi and Kobe

26
00:01:58,994 --> 00:01:59,829
-yes
-yes

27
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:07,795
What's this?

28
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:10,464
Do you think this kind of thing
Can it be passed at the meeting?

29
00:02:10,548 --> 00:02:11,382
Excuse me…

30
00:02:12,758 --> 00:02:14,468
What's the problem?

31
00:02:14,552 --> 00:02:16,095
Lack of persuasiveness

32
00:02:16,178 --> 00:02:17,304
Persuasiveness

33
00:02:19,765 --> 00:02:21,892
Which project specifically?

34
00:02:25,187 --> 00:02:27,314
Do you need to ask others this kind of question?

35
00:02:27,398 --> 00:02:31,944
So what is your brain used for?

36
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:35,739
I just want to be lazy

37
00:02:35,823 --> 00:02:37,533
sorry

38
00:02:37,616 --> 00:02:39,243
Please tell us…

39
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:40,703
That's all

40
00:02:41,704 --> 00:02:43,330
Please revise it for me before the meeting.

41
00:02:44,874 --> 00:02:49,503
Hey Inoue! No personal belongings allowed there!

42
00:02:57,845 --> 00:02:59,847
The meeting is this week, right?

43
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:00,764
Um

44
00:03:01,056 --> 00:03:03,392
In order not to rush to modify

45
00:03:03,475 --> 00:03:06,312
I clearly sent out the proposal a month in advance.

46
00:03:08,022 --> 00:03:09,815
That person is like this every time

47
00:03:10,816 --> 00:03:11,775
What?

48
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:12,693
nothing

49
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:14,737
morning

50
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:15,738
Good morning

51
00:03:16,155 --> 00:03:18,032
Sorry I'm late

52
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:19,700
Are you feeling unwell?

53
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:21,493
I was so worried that I called you many times.

54
00:03:21,577 --> 00:03:22,995
Thank you for your concern

55
00:03:23,495 --> 00:03:26,624
I accidentally sprained my ankle and went to the hospital

56
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:27,666
Are you okay?

57
00:03:28,292 --> 00:03:30,920
So pitiful, please don't force yourself

58
00:03:31,003 --> 00:03:32,713
Or you can take half a day off.

59
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:33,714
-It doesn't matter
-ah

60
00:03:34,256 --> 00:03:36,717
Just sit down and take your time.

61
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,303
- Sorry for the trouble.
-Won't

62
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:41,221
You sit down slowly

63
00:03:41,305 --> 00:03:43,015
thank you

64
00:03:43,474 --> 00:03:45,434
I think there's some anti-inflammatory tape on my desk.

65
00:03:45,517 --> 00:03:46,393
I'll bring it right away

66
00:03:46,477 --> 00:03:47,519
Thanks

67
00:03:48,354 --> 00:03:49,563
-Kobe
-What's up?

68
00:03:49,647 --> 00:03:52,441
L'Entr'acte Café
Mr. Tanabe called you.

69
00:03:52,524 --> 00:03:53,734
L'Entr'acte Café?

70
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:54,652
Yes

71
00:03:57,738 --> 00:03:59,573
Hello, I am Kobe

72
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:03,243
Tanabe-san?

73
00:04:14,046 --> 00:04:16,298
(Café L'Entr'acte)

74
00:04:18,008 --> 00:04:19,259
(Today's vegetables sold directly from the production area)

75
00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:23,847
Please enjoy

76
00:04:27,977 --> 00:04:28,852
Welcome

77
00:04:33,232 --> 00:04:34,066
- The food is served
-Wow

78
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:36,026
This is our signature lunch.
Salad French Savory Crepes

79
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:37,444
Looks delicious

80
00:04:37,528 --> 00:04:39,279
Please use slowly

81
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:44,535
Don't you have to be busy during lunch time?

82
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:46,954
Our part-time staff are excellent

83
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:49,498
You are a special guest.

84
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,168
Then I'll start.

85
00:04:53,252 --> 00:04:54,086
Please use

86
00:04:59,383 --> 00:05:01,260
Really delicious

87
00:05:01,343 --> 00:05:02,302
-Really?
-Um

88
00:05:03,387 --> 00:05:05,347
It's amazing that you are the chef.

89
00:05:05,431 --> 00:05:06,932
-Are you surprised?
-Um

90
00:05:07,016 --> 00:05:10,060
I thought you were going to be a director or an actor or something like that.

91
00:05:10,144 --> 00:05:13,856
I continued to participate in drama performances in college.
But the development was not smooth

92
00:05:14,523 --> 00:05:17,192
Working as a chef has become my main job

93
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:19,486
This path seems to suit me better.

94
00:05:19,862 --> 00:05:21,447
This shop is great

95
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:22,364
Um

96
00:05:22,448 --> 00:05:26,493
The entrance
It means "half-time" in French.

97
00:05:27,119 --> 00:05:30,914
I want to turn this into
A place where people can take a break from their busy lives

98
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:35,502
Take a break, eh?

99
00:05:39,715 --> 00:05:42,301
Sorry, I called you at the company.

100
00:05:42,384 --> 00:05:43,260
It doesn't matter

101
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:44,720
Because I want to have a good chat with you

102
00:05:46,055 --> 00:05:48,682
The private message you sent me before

103
00:05:48,766 --> 00:05:50,559
I just realized it recently. I'm sorry.

104
00:05:50,642 --> 00:05:51,727
It doesn't matter at all

105
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:53,854
Anyway, we meet again now.

106
00:06:00,194 --> 00:06:04,364
After that, Mita and the others also want to contact you

107
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:06,700
They may find you through social media

108
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:09,953
I've never been good at using social media.

109
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:12,331
I always feel like my energy will be taken away after watching it

110
00:06:12,414 --> 00:06:13,248
Um

111
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,044
(Reina: I had a lot of fun at the high school reunion)

112
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:17,961
(Kobe Misa)

113
00:06:21,006 --> 00:06:22,007
(Delete account)

114
00:06:22,091 --> 00:06:23,801
(Log in)

115
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:31,100
I'll give it a try.

116
00:06:31,934 --> 00:06:32,768
What?

117
00:06:33,644 --> 00:06:38,148
I always feel that things have come to this point
What other people post is irrelevant to me.

118
00:06:38,232 --> 00:06:39,817
Yeah?

119
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:40,734
Um

120
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:43,946
Then please follow our store.

121
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:45,155
-track?
-Um

122
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:48,450
(Café L'Entr'acte)

123
00:06:53,455 --> 00:06:54,665
-Success
-good

124
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:57,376
This looks delicious too.

125
00:06:57,459 --> 00:06:58,544
-Really?
-Um

126
00:07:05,843 --> 00:07:07,511
Sorry to bother you.

127
00:07:09,513 --> 00:07:10,681
Can I join in too?

128
00:07:18,856 --> 00:07:21,775
I was planning to contact Yuto today.

129
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:27,239
I want to find you two together
The three of us met

130
00:07:31,493 --> 00:07:32,494
sorry

131
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,253
I did something very childish
I'm really reflecting on myself.

132
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:45,048
When I was in high school

133
00:07:45,549 --> 00:07:48,719
I'm afraid that you, Misa, will be snatched away by Yuto.

134
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:53,807
Because Misa, you are my only friend

135
00:07:54,558 --> 00:07:57,394
You have a lot of friends, right?

136
00:07:58,437 --> 00:07:59,646
That's just on the surface

137
00:08:00,731 --> 00:08:03,775
My only real friend is Misa

138
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,863
What I did made a big fuss

139
00:08:08,697 --> 00:08:12,451
There were many times when I wanted to tell the truth but couldn't.

140
00:08:13,619 --> 00:08:16,914
I've always felt guilty about you two.

141
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:20,042
Then why did you lie to me and ask me to attend the class reunion?

142
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:22,085
You just want to see me get hurt?

143
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:27,049
I don't expect you to forgive me
But there's one thing I must say.

144
00:08:29,343 --> 00:08:32,804
I never gloated over Misa getting hurt.

145
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:38,143
I hope you can believe me on this one thing.

146
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:47,611
Lina raised her head.

147
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:53,158
That's enough, Reina.

148
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:56,328
Because I know...

149
00:08:58,914 --> 00:09:00,999
Your real mood

150
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:04,670
Misa

151
00:09:12,761 --> 00:09:17,349
I'm worried that you'll abandon me
So I couldn't sleep last night

152
00:09:18,267 --> 00:09:20,852
I would never forgive you.

153
00:09:20,936 --> 00:09:24,564
Misa, you and Yuto are really generous.

154
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:28,277
I have a good friend like you, Misa.
It's really luxurious.

155
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:31,571
How are your feet?

156
00:09:33,365 --> 00:09:35,659
It hurts a little when I walk

157
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:42,291
Thanks

158
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:48,922
I have something to tell you

159
00:09:51,383 --> 00:09:54,970
Maybe I did something too much to you.
So they will be punished

160
00:09:55,804 --> 00:09:58,223
A woman I don't know contacted me.

161
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:00,600
She said she was dating Cheng

162
00:10:02,894 --> 00:10:06,356
That guy cheated on me for three years

163
00:10:07,733 --> 00:10:08,692
That’s too much!

164
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:10,569
Such a dishonest person should break up immediately...

165
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:11,862
We have broken up

166
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:13,905
when?

167
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:15,115
This morning

168
00:10:16,158 --> 00:10:18,243
Wait, this is weird.

169
00:10:18,327 --> 00:10:19,536
Please break up with me!

170
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:22,289
Really delicious

171
00:10:25,876 --> 00:10:28,545
They had a huge fight after being caught cheating

172
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:32,090
Lina should be on Christmas Eve
Will be dumped by the other party

173
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:36,178
How come? Why did you break up early?

174
00:10:37,179 --> 00:10:39,639
But I also had a new encounter

175
00:10:40,599 --> 00:10:42,434
-Encounter?
- How should I put it...

176
00:10:42,517 --> 00:10:43,727
Fate's arrangement?

177
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:48,523
Like someone who didn't care at all
Suddenly came into my sight

178
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:50,484
Could it be that...

179
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:52,527
Tomoya

180
00:11:27,646 --> 00:11:28,480
that…

181
00:11:29,564 --> 00:11:31,483
Thank you so much this morning

182
00:11:32,067 --> 00:11:36,488
Because having you by my side makes me feel safe

183
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:41,368
Why? How?

184
00:11:41,952 --> 00:11:44,454
I know all of Reina's past boyfriends.

185
00:11:44,538 --> 00:11:47,874
In the first life
Minister Suzuki and Reina have nothing in common

186
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:49,918
Could it be...

187
00:11:50,419 --> 00:11:51,294
sorry

188
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:57,592
This person in his second life
Suddenly broke into my life

189
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:01,721
What caused Reina's arrow of love to turn towards this person?

190
00:12:03,432 --> 00:12:04,599
If that’s the case…

191
00:12:10,689 --> 00:12:12,023
Mind your own business!

192
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:17,237
Then I'll go first

193
00:12:27,581 --> 00:12:28,707
Mind your own business!

194
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:32,878
Is it necessary to be so angry?

195
00:12:44,181 --> 00:12:45,932
(Final confirmation at 9:00, event starts at 11:00)

196
00:12:46,641 --> 00:12:48,226
What should I do? If this continues...

197
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:56,818
Is that Muscat's proposal?

198
00:12:58,236 --> 00:12:59,070
Um

199
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:02,824
Do you really want to modify all of them?

200
00:13:04,242 --> 00:13:07,704
Kobe, just do your job well.

201
00:13:09,664 --> 00:13:12,083
No modification is needed at all

202
00:13:17,047 --> 00:13:18,131
I also edited

203
00:13:18,632 --> 00:13:19,466
What?

204
00:13:19,925 --> 00:13:21,801
- This takes time.
-It doesn't matter

205
00:13:23,762 --> 00:13:25,680
- So start from here
-good

206
00:13:44,074 --> 00:13:45,075
Thanks

207
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:54,167
We stayed up late and worked overtime, and we were exhausted...

208
00:13:55,585 --> 00:13:58,004
No, rewriting sucks.

209
00:13:58,088 --> 00:13:59,798
Rewrite...

210
00:13:59,881 --> 00:14:01,675
It is totally unacceptable to rewrite! Rejected!

211
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:14,396
Because of this…

212
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:20,694

215
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:51,141

I'm sorry I left everything to you yesterday.

218
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:57,397
Is your daughter okay?

219
00:14:58,356 --> 00:15:00,525
She held out her hand as she fell

220
00:15:00,609 --> 00:15:04,654
Bruise on right arm
Pinky and ring finger fractures

221
00:15:07,324 --> 00:15:11,369
Kobe, the file you sent this morning
Is it the latest version?

222
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:13,913
What?

223
00:15:20,545 --> 00:15:23,673
Sorry, I sent out the first version of the plan.

224
00:15:25,508 --> 00:15:27,260
Sumiyoshi, Kobe!

225
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:33,516
I've finished reading

226
00:15:34,017 --> 00:15:36,186
Sorry, I sent the wrong file.

227
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:40,315
Thanks to my suggestion
You finally submitted a decent plan.

228
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:43,693
I will bring it up in the meeting

229
00:16:03,838 --> 00:16:06,257
- No modification required
-What?

230
00:16:06,341 --> 00:16:09,302
We don't have to stay up late or work overtime

231
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:12,347
I understand your feelings but...

232
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:14,224
The section chief wasn't even watching.

233
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:17,394
Whether it is the first version or the revised version of the plan
He won't read the content.

234
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:20,105
He only takes a quick look before the meeting starts.

235
00:16:20,188 --> 00:16:21,022
What?

236
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:29,364
We don't need to be tossed around by stupid bosses

237
00:16:30,532 --> 00:16:32,283
No need to modify the first version of the plan

238
00:16:32,367 --> 00:16:35,453
Just change the font, layout and order of the data
Just keep submitting.

239
00:16:35,537 --> 00:16:37,872
But if you are discovered...

240
00:16:37,956 --> 00:16:39,165
Leave it to me

241
00:16:39,249 --> 00:16:41,126
Let's get off work on time this week.

242
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:43,503
There's no way this can happen

243
00:16:43,586 --> 00:16:45,880
You have to pick up your daughter from cram school.

244
00:16:45,964 --> 00:16:47,966
She is at an active age.

245
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:50,176
If you don't pay attention, you might get hurt.

246
00:16:51,469 --> 00:16:55,181
Sumiyoshi's deputy section chief had his time taken away by a bad guy

247
00:16:56,224 --> 00:16:57,976
It's a waste of life

248
00:17:06,901 --> 00:17:07,736
It's crazy

249
00:17:08,445 --> 00:17:12,031
Section Chief Tomita is really exaggerating
But you guys are no less

250
00:17:14,284 --> 00:17:18,246
But I didn't expect you to be so courageous, Kobe.

251
00:17:18,747 --> 00:17:21,499
The appearance clearly looks like a serious and timid lamb

252
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:22,417
Ouch

Sumiyoshi, Kobe

256
00:17:36,848 --> 00:17:38,600
Do you think I'm a fool?

257
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:44,773
I called you at the beginning
Have you handed in this plan?

258
00:17:46,107 --> 00:17:50,111
Thanks to my suggestion
You finally submitted a decent plan.

259
00:17:53,698 --> 00:17:56,075
I will bring it up in the meeting

260
00:18:14,177 --> 00:18:18,473
Mom and Dad want me to take it
Butter baked potatoes for you guys

261
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:19,891
-Really?
-Thanks

262
00:18:19,974 --> 00:18:22,310
- Eat as much as you can
-Thanks

263
00:18:22,393 --> 00:18:23,978
Today we are your treat

264
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:26,231
Thank you for the treat

265
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:33,947
By the way, is Section Chief Tomita okay with his injuries?

266
00:18:34,906 --> 00:18:38,952
I heard he had bruises on his right arm.
Pinky and ring finger fractures

267
00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:48,837

268
00:18:51,047 --> 00:18:51,881
-You are so bad
-You are so bad

269
00:18:55,552 --> 00:18:57,929
But thank you Kobe

270
00:18:58,012 --> 00:19:00,598
I always feel that I have become more energetic

271
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:06,062
- Come eat more
-Thanks

272
00:19:07,939 --> 00:19:11,150
I'm the same as Deputy Section Chief Sumiyoshi.

273
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:15,697
We all believe that as long as we work hard

274
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:18,449
One day it will pay off

275
00:19:18,533 --> 00:19:20,493
But he became a hard-working, self-sacrificing lamb

276
00:19:21,452 --> 00:19:23,997
A lamb without a companion and lost from the flock

277
00:19:24,831 --> 00:19:26,541
That's why they were eaten by hyenas.

Muscat grape project proposal to be approved at meeting

279
00:19:35,466 --> 00:19:38,469

00:20:05,413 --> 00:20:06,414
But…

285
00:20:06,497 --> 00:20:08,791
Then choose the third proposal, Peanuts

286
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:10,376
Everything was taken away

287
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:11,294
You write it down

288
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:13,129
They were all taken away by Section Chief Tomita and Reina

289
00:20:14,797 --> 00:20:18,384
Section Chief Tomita took away the project that was progressing smoothly.

290
00:20:18,468 --> 00:20:20,720
Kicked Deputy Section Chief Sumiyoshi and me out of the project

291

292
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:31,356
Well, you should take a good rest.

293
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:32,398
Okay?

294
00:20:32,941 --> 00:20:33,858
that's all

295
00:20:33,942 --> 00:20:37,320
Sumiyoshi's deputy section chief resigned due to exhaustion

(Currently on leave)

297
00:20:47,538 --> 00:20:49,624
I took a leave of absence because I had cancer.

298
00:20:49,707 --> 00:20:51,376
As for my vacant position...

299
00:21:02,553 --> 00:21:04,097
Can't be a sheep

302
00:21:09,143 --> 00:21:10,853
No, she's drunk.

303
00:21:15,149 --> 00:21:17,193
-start
- Eat it

304
00:21:18,695 --> 00:21:19,612
good

305
00:21:19,696 --> 00:21:21,239
The meat is cooked

306
00:21:23,324 --> 00:21:25,660
-It's delicious
-It's delicious, right?

307
00:21:25,743 --> 00:21:27,120
Very delicious

308
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:34,669
- The meat should be cooked, right?
- Looks ripe.

309
00:21:52,145 --> 00:21:53,604
Sorry, Reina, have you been waiting for a long time?

310
00:21:53,688 --> 00:21:54,814
No

311
00:21:55,565 --> 00:21:59,902
Misa said she was having dinner with the department
She usually refuses to participate.

312
00:22:00,403 --> 00:22:03,239
Yes, I was rejected by her too.

313
00:22:04,741 --> 00:22:07,160
Don’t you think Misa is acting weird lately?

314
00:22:08,077 --> 00:22:09,037
What?

315
00:22:09,996 --> 00:22:10,955
Um

316
00:22:12,582 --> 00:22:14,751
I rarely see her so upset.

317
00:22:15,084 --> 00:22:16,753
It's so weird

318
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:20,298
Youya, you should be more careful

319
00:22:21,007 --> 00:22:22,467
What should I be careful about?

320
00:22:23,384 --> 00:22:28,347
Some people start to hesitate before getting married.

321
00:22:28,431 --> 00:22:30,266
Is the other person the right one?

322
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:31,601
impossible…

323
00:22:32,143 --> 00:22:34,062
Only Misa can't be like that

324
00:22:35,146 --> 00:22:36,564
Excuse me, I want a whiskey and soda.

326
00:22:38,775 --> 00:22:41,402
You know Director Suzuki of the Business Strategy Department, right?

328
00:22:43,237 --> 00:22:44,781
How are others?

329
00:22:45,114 --> 00:22:46,949
He's just a rich dude.

330
00:22:47,033 --> 00:22:49,160
Are there any rumors of opposite sex?

331
00:22:49,243 --> 00:22:50,328
I haven't heard of it

332
00:22:50,411 --> 00:22:52,789
Is there really no other information?

333
00:22:53,706 --> 00:22:54,665
What?

334
00:22:55,124 --> 00:22:57,001
Lina, do you like that type?

335
00:22:57,627 --> 00:22:59,253
No

336
00:22:59,337 --> 00:23:01,672
There are young girls in our department who are interested

337
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:05,927
I heard that he studied plants when he was in college.

338
00:23:06,761 --> 00:23:08,262
He should be a science geek, right?

339
00:23:08,846 --> 00:23:11,224
Is he not very good at getting along with girls?

340
00:23:11,307 --> 00:23:12,725
It's possible

341
00:23:13,184 --> 00:23:15,436
After all, he only cares about work and is very rigid.

342
00:23:17,188 --> 00:23:19,190
I'm definitely more attracted to the opposite sex.

343
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:21,692
The most important thing for a man is communication skills

344
00:23:21,776 --> 00:23:27,156
His family is financially strong
I am also good at making money and I don't cheat.

345
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,866
Excellent conditions

346
00:23:31,244 --> 00:23:32,245
Sorry for the long wait

00:23:33,287 --> 00:23:34,247

350
00:23:44,132 --> 00:23:46,676
And he might be able to handle it.

351
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:01,858
They must think we're easy to deal with.

352
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:04,068
We have to preemptively devise a strategy.

353
00:24:04,152 --> 00:24:04,986
-good
-good

354
00:24:05,069 --> 00:24:06,487
You also need to prepare in advance

355
00:24:06,571 --> 00:24:08,698
And we have found a lot of reinforcements in other departments

356
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:09,907
-good
-good

357
00:24:10,366 --> 00:24:13,536
If the Muscat project gets on track
We were excluded

358
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:15,329
That’s too unwilling, isn’t it?

359
00:24:15,413 --> 00:24:17,290
But the plan has not been approved yet.

360
00:24:17,373 --> 00:24:19,375
Are you worrying too much?

361
00:24:20,418 --> 00:24:24,172
- Sorry we're so noisy and smell like sheep
-Excuse me

362
00:24:24,255 --> 00:24:26,257
It doesn't matter. There are no other guests anyway.

363
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:27,175
That's right

364
00:24:27,258 --> 00:24:28,926
Speaking of Muscat grapes

365
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:30,845
Do you know Ichinose Orchard in Nagano?

366
00:24:30,928 --> 00:24:32,555
- It's very famous there.
-Yeah?

367
00:24:32,638 --> 00:24:33,514
Yes

368
00:24:33,598 --> 00:24:36,142
Their quality has been well known in recent years.

369
00:24:36,767 --> 00:24:39,937
But because it's so popular
So we don't accept orders from new customers.

370
00:24:40,021 --> 00:24:42,815
It shouldn't be that bad.

371
00:24:42,899 --> 00:24:45,401
They told me that if they have good clients, they are welcome to introduce them.

372
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:47,278
But when I contacted them...

373
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:50,114
What year is this year? 2015?

374
00:24:51,032 --> 00:24:52,700
Can we sign a contract with them now?

375
00:24:53,326 --> 00:24:55,119
She was really drunk.

376
00:24:55,912 --> 00:24:57,705
Next time I will go to help with the harvest.

377
00:24:57,788 --> 00:24:59,081
-What?
-Are you guys coming?

378
00:24:59,874 --> 00:25:00,708
I want to go!

379
00:25:01,751 --> 00:25:05,087
That's how the Muscat grape project will proceed.

380
00:25:05,171 --> 00:25:06,839
-Excuse me, everyone.
-Please advise

381
00:25:07,256 --> 00:25:10,927
Signed a contract with a popular orchard
Then spread the word through social media

382
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:14,305
If we take action now
It can also catch up with other companies' gift promotions

383
00:25:14,388 --> 00:25:16,224
Can you catch up with other companies?

384
00:25:16,557 --> 00:25:18,559
I'm talking to myself, please pretend I didn't say anything

385
00:25:19,143 --> 00:25:22,230
About social media promotion
I'll talk to the PR department.

386
00:25:22,313 --> 00:25:24,232
We want to take beautiful photos for the photo wall

387
00:25:24,315 --> 00:25:25,441
Beautiful photos on the photo wall?

388
00:25:26,192 --> 00:25:27,026
no…

389
00:25:27,485 --> 00:25:28,569
I mean, let's work hard together.

390
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:32,490
Photo wall network beautiful photos are not popular at this time

391
00:25:37,495 --> 00:25:41,082
I will also consult with my colleagues
This will increase reinforcements

392
00:25:41,666 --> 00:25:44,919
Make the most of your good connections

393
00:25:49,465 --> 00:25:50,299
Connections?

394
00:26:01,727 --> 00:26:04,063
(I am Reina Esaka. Thank you so much for the other day)

395
00:26:12,029 --> 00:26:14,782
(I want to express my gratitude. Are you free?)

396
00:26:14,865 --> 00:26:16,534
(I want to know more about the Minister)

397
00:26:16,617 --> 00:26:17,451
(send)

398
00:26:30,756 --> 00:26:31,590
that…

399
00:26:43,227 --> 00:26:45,062
Don't ask me out at work

400
00:26:46,439 --> 00:26:48,316
I'm sorry

401
00:26:48,899 --> 00:26:50,651
I want you to bring me my ring.

402
00:26:50,735 --> 00:26:53,821
Last time I stayed at your house, I left it on the sink and forgot to take it away

403
00:26:53,904 --> 00:26:55,114
You can send a message.

404
00:26:55,197 --> 00:26:56,032
Live in his house?

405
00:26:57,033 --> 00:26:58,284
You won't pay attention to me

406
00:27:01,078 --> 00:27:02,038
This one?

407
00:27:03,998 --> 00:27:07,168
This is my favorite ring.

408
00:27:07,793 --> 00:27:09,962
Don't forget to take away the gifts given by others.

409
00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:13,549
Next time you come to my house, tell me first

410
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:15,217
Don't bother

411
00:27:15,676 --> 00:27:17,136
Then you are not allowed to come again

412
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:18,721
What?

413
00:27:18,804 --> 00:27:20,306
You will obviously ignore me

414
00:27:20,389 --> 00:27:22,475
I shouldn't have given you a backup key.

415
00:27:22,892 --> 00:27:24,352
Let me go, I'm leaving.

416
00:27:38,949 --> 00:27:40,159
What are you doing

417
00:27:46,457 --> 00:27:47,792
This is the Isobeyaki tea set

418
00:27:47,875 --> 00:27:49,418
-Thanks
- Please enjoy your meal

419
00:27:53,214 --> 00:27:54,799
This plan is very good.

420
00:27:55,549 --> 00:27:58,844
Muscat grapes have been popular in recent years

421
00:27:59,512 --> 00:28:01,639
The planting area is gradually expanding

422
00:28:06,394 --> 00:28:08,938
(Trend of Muscat grape planting area)

423
00:28:09,021 --> 00:28:11,440
It is now about four times as high as it was five years ago

424
00:28:11,524 --> 00:28:14,151
Overseas demand will likely increase in the future

425
00:28:14,652 --> 00:28:16,862
You have a keen eye.

426
00:28:18,989 --> 00:28:21,575
Who do you focus on?

427
00:28:21,659 --> 00:28:23,869
Living together with a new employee who is younger than you?

428
00:28:23,953 --> 00:28:26,914
Or semi-cohabitation? They acted too fast, didn't they?

429
00:28:27,957 --> 00:28:28,791
Wait a moment

430
00:28:28,874 --> 00:28:30,376
-Is he your boyfriend?
-No

431
00:28:30,459 --> 00:28:32,837
- But you two look like a good match
-No

432
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,672
If I disturb your date
Maybe I should leave?

433
00:28:34,755 --> 00:28:36,215
I'm leaving

434
00:28:36,757 --> 00:28:38,050
What was that conversation about?

435
00:28:38,467 --> 00:28:39,510
So scary

436
00:28:40,594 --> 00:28:41,512
Are you playing games?

437
00:28:41,595 --> 00:28:45,015
Couples whose feelings have faded seek excitement
And involve outsiders in the game?

438
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:47,184
Have you reached this level?

439
00:28:48,561 --> 00:28:49,395
Kobe

440
00:28:50,354 --> 00:28:51,188
What's up?

441
00:28:51,272 --> 00:28:55,234
You go to my boss in another department.
Discuss this project

442
00:28:55,818 --> 00:28:57,862
Is it because you want to take advantage of me?

443
00:29:01,198 --> 00:29:03,075
I know this is against the rules...

444
00:29:03,159 --> 00:29:04,201
Please use me

445
00:29:04,869 --> 00:29:05,703
What?

446
00:29:11,542 --> 00:29:13,169
(I know, I want to know more about you)

447
00:29:13,252 --> 00:29:14,170
(I am so happy!)

448
00:29:19,675 --> 00:29:21,135
I'm so sorry.

449
00:29:21,218 --> 00:29:23,262
I'll reconsider this with my department.

450
00:29:28,726 --> 00:29:30,186
- No this...
-That's it.

451
00:29:32,688 --> 00:29:33,522
that…

452
00:29:34,857 --> 00:29:37,610
Thank you for this. Excuse me.

453
00:29:37,693 --> 00:29:38,694
etc…

454
00:29:39,195 --> 00:29:41,322
Wait a moment

455
00:29:45,326 --> 00:29:46,952
He's a rotten guy indeed.

456
00:29:47,036 --> 00:29:50,372
Chasing after the girls in the company all day long
Bad rich kid

457
00:29:53,375 --> 00:29:56,045
Please let me explain

458
00:30:13,229 --> 00:30:14,438
what to do?

459
00:30:21,862 --> 00:30:26,325
Because having you by my side makes me feel safe

460
00:30:31,288 --> 00:30:32,957
(I will contact you again)

461
00:30:33,749 --> 00:30:34,959
This continues...

462
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,131
I can't accept it!

463
00:30:43,676 --> 00:30:45,094
Misaya

464
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,013
What's unacceptable?

465
00:30:48,514 --> 00:30:50,057
What are you doing

466
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:52,309
You haven't been with me lately.

467
00:30:52,393 --> 00:30:55,229
Don't come in without permission.

468
00:30:55,312 --> 00:30:58,357
You gave me a backup key.
I can come anytime.

469
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:06,699
Did I tell you that?
I'm busy preparing the muscat grape project

470
00:31:06,782 --> 00:31:07,992
That case

471
00:31:09,201 --> 00:31:10,703
I became a business window.

472
00:31:11,745 --> 00:31:12,663
I know

473
00:31:12,746 --> 00:31:14,164
Same as the first time

474
00:31:14,248 --> 00:31:16,375
Are you going to the farm in Nagano tomorrow?

475
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:17,543
How do you know?

476
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:19,378
Lina told me

477
00:31:20,921 --> 00:31:22,172
when…

478
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:24,425
I will go with you too

479
00:31:24,508 --> 00:31:27,553
No need for tomorrow, just a preliminary investigation

480
00:31:27,636 --> 00:31:30,264
I'm also a member of the team

481
00:31:30,347 --> 00:31:33,350
I heard that the director of the business strategy department will also be there.

482
00:31:33,934 --> 00:31:35,019
Minister Suzuki?

483
00:31:35,102 --> 00:31:38,063
Yes, Lina asked him out.

484
00:31:40,649 --> 00:31:41,650
no

485
00:31:41,734 --> 00:31:43,944
No matter how unfaithful Minister Suzuki is

486
00:31:44,028 --> 00:31:45,863
You still can't beat him

487
00:31:47,698 --> 00:31:48,574
Tomoya

488
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:51,910
Let's go shopping

489
00:31:53,162 --> 00:31:56,081
The last time your favorite shirt got splashed with curry
Can’t wear it anymore?

490
00:31:56,165 --> 00:31:58,459
I'll buy you some cool clothes for tomorrow.

491
00:31:58,876 --> 00:32:01,253
Why dress up to go to the farm?

492
00:32:02,588 --> 00:32:05,382
I want everyone to see how handsome you are

493
00:32:07,801 --> 00:32:10,012
This is the competition between women.

494
00:32:10,471 --> 00:32:12,348
Misa, you are so greedy

495
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:26,403
At least his appearance should suit Rina's taste.

496
00:32:43,545 --> 00:32:44,922
It suits me well

497
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:47,174
no

498
00:32:47,675 --> 00:32:49,843
It fully demonstrates his narcissistic style

499
00:32:49,927 --> 00:32:52,680
Is there no way to let him exude his natural charm?

500
00:32:52,763 --> 00:32:53,597
For example…

501
00:33:10,948 --> 00:33:12,533
What? Minister Suzuki?

502
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,660
Are the two of them already dating?

503
00:33:15,953 --> 00:33:16,829
Tomoya

504
00:33:17,204 --> 00:33:19,081
-What?
- Let's go to another store

505
00:33:24,795 --> 00:33:26,004
How about Misa?

506
00:33:28,507 --> 00:33:30,134
What are you looking at?

507
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:31,844
Misa

508
00:33:37,433 --> 00:33:38,934
How about this Misa?

509
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:39,852
Um

510
00:33:45,107 --> 00:33:46,024
Misa

511
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:49,027
-How about it?
- Well, that one will do.

512
00:33:49,111 --> 00:33:51,321
What does "that one will do" mean?

513
00:33:54,324 --> 00:33:56,410
Then you have to wear this dress tomorrow

514
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,002
I'll stay at your house today.

515
00:34:05,294 --> 00:34:06,128
What?

516
00:34:06,628 --> 00:34:09,047
Anyway, we will go out together tomorrow.

517
00:34:10,674 --> 00:34:12,760
I have other plans later.

518
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:15,053
Other arrangements?

519
00:34:16,096 --> 00:34:17,556
What other plans do you have for later?

520
00:34:20,726 --> 00:34:23,687
Arrangements that have nothing to do with you

521
00:34:25,481 --> 00:34:26,440
What?

522
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:30,027
What arrangements can’t you tell your fiancé?

523
00:34:30,819 --> 00:34:32,237
Isn’t this weird?

524
00:34:33,781 --> 00:34:35,616
I don't understand what this means

525
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,744
We're going to spend our lives together.

526
00:34:38,827 --> 00:34:40,621
Aren't you being too selfish?

527
00:34:41,622 --> 00:34:45,292
You said you wanted to go shopping.
I stayed with you all day

528
00:34:45,375 --> 00:34:48,086
How can you do it because of other things?
Leave me behind?

529
00:34:48,170 --> 00:34:49,421
Can't you think of others?

530
00:34:49,505 --> 00:34:52,925
Now it's okay because I'm too gentle
If it were any other man, he would have exploded long ago.

531
00:34:58,639 --> 00:34:59,473
Let's go

532
00:35:00,933 --> 00:35:01,850
Letting go

533
00:35:10,025 --> 00:35:11,360
So what if I'm selfish?

534
00:35:12,277 --> 00:35:13,487
My life...

535
00:35:14,655 --> 00:35:16,782
It doesn't revolve around you.

536
00:35:26,875 --> 00:35:28,544
Thank you for spending the whole day with me today

537
00:35:29,753 --> 00:35:33,298
I'm really sorry for hurting you, Reina.

538
00:35:33,882 --> 00:35:36,844
But my love for you is not fake

539
00:35:51,817 --> 00:35:53,110
I hope this is the last time

540
00:35:53,861 --> 00:35:54,903
What finally?

541
00:35:55,654 --> 00:36:00,033
Don't mess with my company anymore.
My parents and my girlfriend's family do everything

542
00:36:00,117 --> 00:36:01,410
It's all my fault

543
00:36:01,827 --> 00:36:03,203
They are innocent

544
00:36:06,456 --> 00:36:08,041
You're obviously begging me

545
00:36:08,125 --> 00:36:10,294
But a condescending attitude

546
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:16,758
I'm really sorry!

547
00:36:16,842 --> 00:36:18,802
Please forgive me!

548
00:36:19,845 --> 00:36:20,888
I already knew it

549
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:28,478
Men who approach me are not good people.

550
00:36:44,244 --> 00:36:46,747
I have never been good at dealing with people who are in a bad mood.

551
00:36:47,247 --> 00:36:48,206
I'm back

552
00:36:49,082 --> 00:36:51,627
No. 11 Ebisu Lighto is currently in the lead

553
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:52,794
Mom, today...

554
00:36:52,878 --> 00:36:54,254
Would you please shut up?

555
00:36:54,963 --> 00:36:56,548
The last 400 meters left

556
00:36:57,674 --> 00:37:00,385
Damn, I can't believe what's going on...

557
00:37:01,011 --> 00:37:03,430
No. 1 North Shiba Spain is catching up

558
00:37:03,513 --> 00:37:05,265
Now we come to the final bend and straight

559
00:37:05,349 --> 00:37:06,725
He actually ran outside.

560
00:37:06,808 --> 00:37:09,603
Ebisu Lighto ran to the outside
But still leading

561
00:37:09,686 --> 00:37:12,731
The No. 1 Kitashi Spain rushed to the second place

562
00:37:12,814 --> 00:37:15,776
Marinette No. 10 was squeezed out
Relegated to third place

563
00:37:15,859 --> 00:37:19,112
Kitashiba Spain and Ebisu LiteO
The two sides are at a stalemate!

564
00:37:19,196 --> 00:37:21,573
Ebisu Lighto wins!
North Shiba Spain Second…

565
00:37:21,657 --> 00:37:23,116
I turn pale in an instant.

566
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,868
Becoming anxious and starting to read people's faces

567
00:37:24,952 --> 00:37:27,329
Is a briefing a place for you to daydream?

568
00:37:27,412 --> 00:37:29,539
What a loss your reckless behavior caused!

569
00:37:29,623 --> 00:37:30,832
sorry

570
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:33,752
I always feel like I need to lighten the mood

571
00:37:56,817 --> 00:37:58,860
What am I afraid of?

572
00:38:00,362 --> 00:38:02,906
So what if I'm hated or beaten?

573
00:38:04,241 --> 00:38:06,994
I've been killed once.

574
00:38:42,446 --> 00:38:44,364
- Get in the car
- I'll just sit in the back seat

575
00:38:44,448 --> 00:38:45,490
It's okay, get in the car.

576
00:38:46,074 --> 00:38:46,908
What?

577
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:52,891
Isn’t the scenery great?

578
00:39:52,974 --> 00:39:53,850
Um

579
00:39:58,021 --> 00:39:59,856
Will I contact you in the future?

580
00:40:00,524 --> 00:40:03,777
I had asked her to come along.
But she said she had transportation

581
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:04,778
good

582
00:40:21,962 --> 00:40:23,839
arrive

583
00:40:31,179 --> 00:40:32,013
Thanks

584
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:34,391
Didn't I tell you to take the tram?

585
00:40:34,474 --> 00:40:36,852
What does it matter? It's the same destination anyway.

586
00:40:36,935 --> 00:40:40,272
-The things we did together...
- I won't tell anyone.

587
00:40:40,355 --> 00:40:42,440
I'll go first, please come back later

588
00:40:53,827 --> 00:40:54,953
Hey

589
00:41:09,551 --> 00:41:10,635
Lina, are you okay?

590
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:12,304
sorry

591
00:41:12,971 --> 00:41:14,055
You sit down.

592
00:41:15,056 --> 00:41:16,308
Thanks

593
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:25,859
Linai sports drink for you

594
00:41:25,942 --> 00:41:27,611
Would you like some tea?

595
00:41:27,694 --> 00:41:28,528
I don't need

596
00:41:31,823 --> 00:41:33,617
He was totally ignored.

597
00:41:34,618 --> 00:41:36,453
Can you please try harder?

598
00:41:37,537 --> 00:41:39,539
-are you tired?
-Won't

599
00:41:40,373 --> 00:41:41,791
I usually work in the office.

600
00:41:41,875 --> 00:41:44,127
-Isn't it fun to do this sometimes?
-Um

601
00:41:44,211 --> 00:41:46,504
The natural environment can really make people feel relaxed

602
00:41:46,588 --> 00:41:47,505
Um

603
00:41:47,589 --> 00:41:51,384
Yes, in the first year of high school
I harvested carrots from the school garden...

604
00:41:51,468 --> 00:41:55,722
Misa and Yuuto are each other's first love

605
00:41:55,805 --> 00:41:58,767
-Like a sweet and sour memory?
- You fell badly at that time

606
00:41:59,392 --> 00:42:01,061
I miss you so much

607
00:42:01,144 --> 00:42:05,899
They recently reunited at a class reunion
Feelings seem to have improved.

608
00:42:05,982 --> 00:42:08,401
-To the mess
-You saved me

609
00:42:08,485 --> 00:42:11,446
I didn't save you. I miss you so much.

610
00:42:14,449 --> 00:42:17,619
Thank you for your help today.

611
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:20,497
We prepare delicious local ingredients

612
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:22,165
Please enjoy

613
00:42:22,249 --> 00:42:24,376
-Thanks
-Thanks

614
00:42:24,459 --> 00:42:26,544
I'll handle it next.

615
00:42:26,628 --> 00:42:27,712
Have a good rest everyone

616
00:42:29,464 --> 00:42:30,382
Looking forward to it

617
00:42:49,818 --> 00:42:50,735
So cool

618
00:42:59,869 --> 00:43:00,829
Let me do it

619
00:43:00,912 --> 00:43:02,163
Thank you

620
00:43:12,132 --> 00:43:13,550
Could he be...

621
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,142
Want to show off in front of Lina?

622
00:43:23,435 --> 00:43:25,478
-Misa, let's go to the barbecue
-Um

623
00:43:25,562 --> 00:43:26,688
Follow me here

624
00:43:28,815 --> 00:43:29,816
Shall we bake this?

625
00:43:29,899 --> 00:43:30,984
-this?
-Um

626
00:43:31,067 --> 00:43:32,444
Is pork ok?

627
00:43:32,527 --> 00:43:34,821
Yeah, this looks delicious.

628
00:43:35,363 --> 00:43:37,407
Is that ok?

629
00:43:43,330 --> 00:43:46,333
Then let's have a toast first, please, Minister Suzuki

630
00:43:46,708 --> 00:43:48,918
Vice Section Chief Nobuyoshi, please come here.

631
00:43:49,836 --> 00:43:50,795
So

632
00:43:50,879 --> 00:43:53,298
I wish the Muscat grape project a success.

633
00:43:53,757 --> 00:43:57,135
-cheers
-cheers

634
00:43:58,762 --> 00:44:02,140
I also wish Misa and Tomoya a happy marriage!

635
00:44:04,684 --> 00:44:05,935
Hey Reina...

636
00:44:07,437 --> 00:44:08,271
Huh?

637
00:44:09,397 --> 00:44:11,483
Don't you all know?

638
00:44:12,317 --> 00:44:14,235
You guys have been drinking together a lot lately

639
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:16,696
I thought you already knew about the engagement.

640
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:17,655
got engaged?

641
00:44:18,573 --> 00:44:19,574
sorry

642
00:44:20,075 --> 00:44:22,077
But it's okay, right Misa?

643
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:23,787
We are all partners

644
00:44:26,122 --> 00:44:29,376
As Misa's good friend, I've always been worried about her.

645
00:44:29,459 --> 00:44:33,004
Misa is obviously a great girl
But there is always no good fate

646
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:39,344
So seeing her and Tomoya finally get married
I'm really happy

647
00:44:40,428 --> 00:44:42,806
Lina, you are rushing too fast.

648
00:44:43,348 --> 00:44:45,392
Please keep it confidential in the company for the time being.

649
00:44:45,475 --> 00:44:46,935
So that's how it is

650
00:44:47,727 --> 00:44:48,812
Congratulations

651
00:44:49,646 --> 00:44:50,772
Thanks

652
00:44:50,855 --> 00:44:52,315
Misa, you stand up too.

653
00:44:55,026 --> 00:44:57,028
Cheers to you two perfect couples

654
00:44:57,112 --> 00:44:58,696
cheers

655
00:44:59,072 --> 00:44:59,989
cheers

656
00:45:00,073 --> 00:45:01,199
-cheers
-cheers

657
00:45:02,242 --> 00:45:03,451
Thank you all

658
00:45:03,868 --> 00:45:05,078
Thanks

659
00:45:05,161 --> 00:45:05,995
Cheers to Misa

660
00:45:09,416 --> 00:45:11,501
Misa, you like to eat meat. I will help you pick the meat.

661
00:45:11,584 --> 00:45:12,710
Really delicious

662
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:15,713
Come

663
00:45:15,797 --> 00:45:16,798
for you

664
00:45:16,881 --> 00:45:17,715
Thanks

665
00:45:19,801 --> 00:45:21,636
I'll eat meat too.

666
00:45:27,434 --> 00:45:28,268
strangeness?

667
00:45:29,561 --> 00:45:32,105
I'll eat meat too.

668
00:45:58,548 --> 00:45:59,591
I don't mind.

669
00:45:59,674 --> 00:46:01,885
- Please go back to eat.
-No

670
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:03,845
It doesn't matter

671
00:46:05,638 --> 00:46:07,307
I don't mind.

672
00:46:07,390 --> 00:46:08,433
No

673
00:46:09,225 --> 00:46:10,310
It doesn't matter

674
00:46:14,689 --> 00:46:17,775
Minister, why are you here today?

675
00:46:19,277 --> 00:46:20,111
"Why"?

676
00:46:20,195 --> 00:46:21,070
Are you free?

677
00:46:23,156 --> 00:46:24,741
I'm not so idle that I have nothing to do.

678
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:27,494
Why are you in a bad mood?

679
00:46:28,453 --> 00:46:30,163
What? Am I in a bad mood?

680
00:46:30,246 --> 00:46:33,750
I sometimes experience feelings of hostility or contempt

681
00:46:36,503 --> 00:46:38,713
I want to know why you are angry

682
00:46:38,796 --> 00:46:40,381
I'm not angry

683
00:46:41,508 --> 00:46:44,177
The person in a bad mood is the minister, right?

684
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:46,846
I just felt the atmosphere was very tense

685
00:46:46,930 --> 00:46:49,599
I think it's not good to make subordinates feel uneasy.

686
00:46:49,682 --> 00:46:53,102
Do you love Hirano Tomoya?

687
00:46:55,772 --> 00:46:58,816
This is not a topic that a boss and his subordinates should talk about...

688
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:00,860
Are you planning to get married like this?

689
00:47:05,031 --> 00:47:06,157
I said...

690
00:47:06,241 --> 00:47:07,492
-you say
- I said...

691
00:47:07,951 --> 00:47:08,785
I'm listening

692
00:47:09,327 --> 00:47:11,037
Can you stop?

693
00:47:12,038 --> 00:47:14,332
It's my freedom to marry whomever I want.

694
00:47:14,415 --> 00:47:16,960
If you have time to meddle in other people's lives

695
00:47:17,710 --> 00:47:19,879
It is better to cherish the future

696
00:47:20,922 --> 00:47:21,756
future?

697
00:47:22,507 --> 00:47:25,176
I know you two are dating.

698
00:47:26,511 --> 00:47:27,345
What?

699
00:47:27,428 --> 00:47:28,972
How much of a scumbag are you?

700
00:47:29,055 --> 00:47:30,848
One after another, he attacked female employees

701
00:47:30,932 --> 00:47:33,601
Am I the third one? Or the fourth?
Fifth, sixth, seventh?

702
00:47:33,685 --> 00:47:35,645
-How many people are there?
- Please calm down.

703
00:47:35,728 --> 00:47:38,690
Don't just chase after women.
Please work hard

704
00:47:38,773 --> 00:47:40,191
If you continue like this

705
00:47:40,275 --> 00:47:42,569
You're just a scumbag, a perverted hyena.

706
00:47:44,654 --> 00:47:46,072
What are you doing?

707
00:47:47,115 --> 00:47:48,866
You sprayed the water yourself

708
00:47:51,744 --> 00:47:53,121
That's really despicable.

709
00:47:53,204 --> 00:47:54,539
You brought your girlfriend here.

710
00:47:54,622 --> 00:47:57,166
But because I want to pursue other girls
Ask your girlfriend to keep quiet

711
00:47:57,250 --> 00:47:58,459
Are you looking down on others too much?

712
00:47:58,543 --> 00:47:59,544
She is my sister

713
00:48:00,003 --> 00:48:00,837
What?

714
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:03,131
The future is my sister

715
00:48:03,631 --> 00:48:05,508
Do you know your future last name?

716
00:48:06,801 --> 00:48:10,263
Suzuki…Future?

717
00:48:12,223 --> 00:48:14,017
The reason why we hid our relationship

718
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:17,687
Because no one in the company knows
She is the general manager's daughter.

719
00:48:18,271 --> 00:48:21,899
Before she learned how to do things
We don't want her to be treated specially.

720
00:48:35,455 --> 00:48:39,292
Is there anything else I should explain?

721
00:48:41,794 --> 00:48:45,673
But you and Reina went on a date to Yokohama yesterday, right?

722
00:48:45,757 --> 00:48:48,134
-Dating?
- I saw Reina's photo wall

723
00:48:49,135 --> 00:48:51,929
Is that really me?

724
00:48:53,765 --> 00:48:56,768
By the way, I was on a business trip in Taiwan yesterday.

725
00:48:57,185 --> 00:48:59,812
Do you need me to show you evidence?

726
00:49:05,735 --> 00:49:06,611
Kobe

727
00:49:08,112 --> 00:49:10,865
What did you just say?

728
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:11,783
You seem to be saying...

729
00:49:12,742 --> 00:49:15,203
Am I a "scumbag, perverted hyena"?

730
00:49:15,662 --> 00:49:16,913
Yeah?

731
00:49:19,207 --> 00:49:22,126
Do you owe me a word?

732
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:24,962
I'm sorry

733
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:32,178
Very good

734
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:36,057
As long as you don't hate me

735
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:37,183
How dare I

736
00:49:37,975 --> 00:49:40,812
I'm really sorry
I don't know how to make amends.

737
00:49:43,022 --> 00:49:46,984
Can you lend me five minutes?

738
00:50:04,752 --> 00:50:09,590
Do you know where to start eating muscat grapes?

739
00:50:10,216 --> 00:50:11,884
Is there such a rule?

740
00:50:11,968 --> 00:50:14,303
Every grape tastes different

741
00:50:19,183 --> 00:50:23,354
Nutrients from fruit trees will reach this part first.

742
00:50:23,813 --> 00:50:26,190
The top one is the sweetest

743
00:50:26,274 --> 00:50:28,568
I do this job

744
00:50:28,651 --> 00:50:30,611
I didn't know this, I'm so ashamed

745
00:50:30,695 --> 00:50:36,743
So if you start eating from the top
It's very sweet at first.

746
00:50:36,826 --> 00:50:40,288
But the sweetness will gradually decrease

747
00:50:42,749 --> 00:50:46,252
I always feel like this is like falling in love

748
00:50:47,795 --> 00:50:48,880
Is your love like this?

749
00:50:55,261 --> 00:50:57,138
I recommend eating from the bottom up.

750
00:50:57,722 --> 00:50:58,973
It was refreshing at the beginning

751
00:50:59,056 --> 00:51:03,936
But the higher you eat, the sweeter it becomes.

752
00:51:05,772 --> 00:51:08,691
Maybe there will be such a love

753
00:51:10,485 --> 00:51:12,487
After all, life is long

754
00:51:19,202 --> 00:51:20,995
Do you want to try it and compare?

755
00:51:23,372 --> 00:51:24,207
That…

756
00:51:30,671 --> 00:51:31,964
The taste is refreshing and delicious

757
00:51:34,175 --> 00:51:36,385
So what's next?

758
00:51:38,763 --> 00:51:40,139
The top part

759
00:51:49,065 --> 00:51:50,024
Huh?

760
00:51:50,566 --> 00:51:52,777
Completely different. Really completely different.

761
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:53,820
Right?

762
00:51:53,903 --> 00:51:54,946
So sweet

763
00:51:55,696 --> 00:51:57,031
There's such a big difference

764
00:51:58,115 --> 00:51:59,450
So cool

765
00:52:05,456 --> 00:52:06,499
Very good

766
00:52:09,794 --> 00:52:11,379
You look so energetic.

767
00:52:12,505 --> 00:52:13,506
It's so nice

768
00:53:01,804 --> 00:53:03,556
Minister, you should try it too.

769
00:53:03,639 --> 00:53:04,765
That…

770
00:53:07,310 --> 00:53:08,144
tasty

771
00:53:08,227 --> 00:53:09,645
-It's delicious, right?
-Yes

772
00:53:09,729 --> 00:53:11,397
Which part do you like best?

773
00:53:12,398 --> 00:53:13,482
Well...

774
00:53:14,692 --> 00:53:17,737
-The sweetness when eating it
-Um

775
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:18,821
It gave me a big shock

776
00:53:18,905 --> 00:53:21,073
Then please eat another one above

777
00:53:21,157 --> 00:53:22,199
-May I?
-Um

778
00:53:22,283 --> 00:53:23,326
Minister, you should eat too.

779
00:53:23,409 --> 00:53:25,620
-It's delicious.
- Then I'll eat this.

780
00:53:25,703 --> 00:53:26,954
Thank you for your hospitality today

781
00:53:27,038 --> 00:53:28,539
No, I want to thank you all.

782
00:53:28,623 --> 00:53:31,250
We would also be happy if we could cooperate with Suzutoya

783
00:53:32,251 --> 00:53:33,461
Please give me more advice

784
00:53:33,544 --> 00:53:35,796
We will contact you again

785
00:53:36,213 --> 00:53:39,091
I'll help here tomorrow, too.
So see you next time in the store

786
00:53:39,175 --> 00:53:41,427
Thank you, Tanabe-san.

787
00:53:42,345 --> 00:53:43,721
Thank you all.

788
00:53:43,804 --> 00:53:45,431
-Thanks
-Thanks

789
00:53:45,514 --> 00:53:46,807
-Thanks for your hard work
-Thanks for your hard work

790
00:53:47,099 --> 00:53:48,142
The future is here

791
00:53:48,225 --> 00:53:49,060
OK

792
00:53:49,143 --> 00:53:50,394
- Let's go then
-OK

793
00:53:51,604 --> 00:53:53,022
Lina, are you okay?

794
00:53:53,105 --> 00:53:54,982
-Are your feet hurting again?
-that…

795
00:53:57,568 --> 00:53:59,528
Could you please give me a ride back home?

796
00:54:00,821 --> 00:54:02,740
I just have something to tell you.

797
00:54:07,244 --> 00:54:08,663
You can put it in the trunk.

798
00:54:16,629 --> 00:54:18,673
It's really annoying

799
00:54:19,674 --> 00:54:21,884
Minister, please drive faster.

800
00:54:26,222 --> 00:54:27,264
Give me Misacha

801
00:54:33,437 --> 00:54:35,940
What is this strange feeling?

802
00:54:37,733 --> 00:54:40,861
This part is a bit itchy but warm

803
00:54:41,278 --> 00:54:43,990
I haven't felt this way in a long time.

804
00:54:46,575 --> 00:54:48,953
Although I'm not a stalker nor a rich kid

805
00:54:49,036 --> 00:54:51,789
But at least I can hold an umbrella for you.

806
00:54:53,416 --> 00:54:56,419
Great to see you're so energetic.

807
00:54:57,336 --> 00:54:58,337
It's so nice

808
00:55:00,256 --> 00:55:02,633
Could this be...

809
00:55:10,975 --> 00:55:12,852
If you are thirsty, please tell me

810
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:14,770
If you’re hungry…

811
00:55:15,229 --> 00:55:16,981
I can also feed you snacks

812
00:55:17,064 --> 00:55:18,607
No

813
00:55:21,235 --> 00:55:23,404
You are from Toyama, right?

814
00:55:23,904 --> 00:55:24,739
right

815
00:55:25,406 --> 00:55:26,824
When did you and Kobe meet?

816
00:55:27,992 --> 00:55:31,829
We have known each other since we were in primary school and have been good friends ever since.

817
00:55:32,455 --> 00:55:33,622
Misa's mother...

818
00:55:38,085 --> 00:55:40,504
Her mother ran away from home with another man

819
00:55:41,047 --> 00:55:42,256
Misa is sad

820
00:55:42,339 --> 00:55:44,592
I comforted her and we became good friends

821
00:55:45,676 --> 00:55:49,096
My mother passed away during the same period.

822
00:55:50,389 --> 00:55:53,434
But I can't tell Misa

823
00:55:56,645 --> 00:55:59,648
Minister, your mother also passed away, right?

824
00:56:01,108 --> 00:56:02,359
I understand your feelings

825
00:56:03,652 --> 00:56:06,614
I am always used to being alone in my heart

826
00:56:07,990 --> 00:56:09,784
It's been clumsy since the beginning

827
00:56:10,659 --> 00:56:12,578
The same goes for the Muscat grape project.

828
00:56:12,661 --> 00:56:15,331
When I made the proposal

829
00:56:15,414 --> 00:56:18,501
Misa cleverly wrote it into the plan...

830
00:56:19,752 --> 00:56:20,836
I see

831
00:56:21,921 --> 00:56:25,091
Misa is very smart
And be friendly to everyone

832
00:56:25,174 --> 00:56:29,011
Today she is also in front of Youya
I have a great time with Yuto.

833
00:56:29,845 --> 00:56:31,514
I have no ill intentions

834
00:56:32,014 --> 00:56:34,141
Want to please many people...

835
00:56:34,642 --> 00:56:36,477
I don't think that's a bad thing

836
00:56:40,564 --> 00:56:43,651
I always lose confidence

837
00:56:45,528 --> 00:56:48,405
I feel like I'm not good enough compared to Misa.

838
00:56:51,659 --> 00:56:56,080
Even my trusted boyfriend betrayed me
And abandoned me

839
00:56:58,958 --> 00:57:01,001
Sorry I complained.

840
00:57:04,255 --> 00:57:05,214
in the end…

841
00:57:07,883 --> 00:57:11,345
I'm alone everywhere I go

842
00:57:17,643 --> 00:57:18,978
Esaka

843
00:57:20,729 --> 00:57:23,023
Are you a good friend of Kobe?

844
00:57:24,275 --> 00:57:26,318
Huh? Yes

845
00:57:26,402 --> 00:57:27,570
You always do this...

846
00:57:28,863 --> 00:57:32,032
Are you destroying your good friend's reputation behind his back?

847
00:57:35,286 --> 00:57:36,412
I didn’t…

848
00:57:36,495 --> 00:57:39,999
Jiang Ban, are you interested in me?

849
00:57:41,542 --> 00:57:45,129
All your words and actions disgust me

850
00:57:48,549 --> 00:57:50,259
You'd better remember one thing

851
00:57:51,719 --> 00:57:56,599
People who harm others but don't care
There will be retribution.

852
00:58:01,645 --> 00:58:04,815
Didn't you say you wanted to get to know me better?

853
00:58:04,899 --> 00:58:05,733
Yes

854
00:58:06,150 --> 00:58:07,985
Today I understand almost everything.

855
00:58:08,861 --> 00:58:10,738
You were dumped by your boyfriend, right?

856
00:58:11,655 --> 00:58:13,949
People like you who have an ugly and twisted heart

857
00:58:14,909 --> 00:58:18,370
I don't think there is a man who truly wants to make you happy

858
00:58:21,624 --> 00:58:25,502
You deliberately went up the stairs

859
00:58:26,086 --> 00:58:28,714
50 chocolates that were dropped and broken

860
00:58:31,634 --> 00:58:34,220
Please compensate the company.

861
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:49,818
What?

862
00:58:49,902 --> 00:58:50,736
What's wrong?

863
00:58:54,990 --> 00:58:56,784
I don't need to give you a ride, do I?

864
00:58:57,534 --> 00:58:59,578
Why do I have to listen to you talking about me like this?

865
00:58:59,662 --> 00:59:01,705
Do you think you understand me?

866
00:59:03,165 --> 00:59:04,208
Your feet...

867
00:59:05,626 --> 00:59:07,836
It's really nothing serious.

868
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:14,885
What are they doing?

869
00:59:15,427 --> 00:59:16,470
Are you having a fight?

870
00:59:16,553 --> 00:59:17,888
It's really rare

871
00:59:33,112 --> 00:59:33,946
What?

872
00:59:44,373 --> 00:59:46,250
You son of a bitch

873
01:01:58,924 --> 01:02:00,926
