1
00:00:39,165 --> 00:00:40,750
How are you?

2
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:42,126
Are you feeling unwell?

3
00:00:43,294 --> 00:00:44,420
I'm fine

4
00:00:47,006 --> 00:00:48,048
This little guy...

5
00:00:49,341 --> 00:00:53,095
I'm worried that the pond will dry up during the summer vacation

6
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:56,056
really

7
00:00:59,685 --> 00:01:01,187
Hope it will rain

8
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:03,939
yes

9
00:01:19,413 --> 00:01:20,831
Hayakame

10
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:23,459
Did you have breakfast?

11
00:01:25,252 --> 00:01:26,796
I'll come back to see you after the first class.

12
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,849
No! That side is better.

13
00:01:38,933 --> 00:01:40,726
More sunshine

14
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:42,728
Go over there quickly.

15
00:01:42,812 --> 00:01:44,730
Go over there quickly.

16
00:01:44,814 --> 00:01:46,774
It's not fun here, you see?

17
00:01:46,857 --> 00:01:49,109
It should be fun on that side or the other side.

18
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:06,585
Kamekichi: I've always thought this should be an orange, right?

19
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:09,171
Do you think this is edible?

20
00:02:10,381 --> 00:02:12,508
Very hard

21
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,889
Really hard

22
00:02:18,973 --> 00:02:21,350
alright

23
00:02:28,524 --> 00:02:29,567
Very sour

24
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:31,569
Really

25
00:02:41,287 --> 00:02:42,746
This shouldn't be eaten.

26
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:57,303
So you decided to work in a company?

27
00:02:57,386 --> 00:02:58,262
right

28
00:02:58,971 --> 00:03:01,974
I will accompany my dad on overseas inspection tours starting in September.

29
00:03:05,102 --> 00:03:09,106
I really hope people like you can stay in college

30
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:15,571
I will turn my dream of becoming a researcher into
Leave it to the next life to realize

31
00:03:32,338 --> 00:03:33,881
Sorry, sorry.

32
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:30,229
I can't believe he's gone so soon.

33
00:04:30,312 --> 00:04:34,191
It's really shocking that he left so young.

34
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:35,317
yes

35
00:04:35,401 --> 00:04:38,654
Maoxiong is obviously much younger than us

36
00:04:38,737 --> 00:04:39,822
Really young

37
00:04:39,905 --> 00:04:43,867
- So pitiful
-What a shame.

38
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:01,635
No way

39
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:07,933
Kamekichi

40
00:05:14,857 --> 00:05:17,067
Kamekichi, where are you?

41
00:05:24,158 --> 00:05:26,785
Kamekichi…

42
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:10,704
(I brought the turtle home, please don't worry)

43
00:07:30,534 --> 00:07:31,743
Good morning, Kamekichi

44
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:39,251
If this is the script of her life...

45
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,049
Hayakame

46
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,218
Did you have breakfast?

47
00:07:48,302 --> 00:07:51,471
- I'm just an unknown extra
- I'll come see you after the first class.

48
00:07:53,849 --> 00:07:55,475
Sorry, sorry.

49
00:07:57,186 --> 00:07:58,478
The lens won't focus.

50
00:07:58,562 --> 00:07:59,897
A student A

51
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,817
Now please tell us your motivation for applying

52
00:08:03,901 --> 00:08:04,943
yes

53
00:08:05,027 --> 00:08:06,486
When I was a kid

54
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:10,741
My father would always be there when I got home
Leave snacks on the table for me

55
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:14,286
Eating the strawberry milk candy from Bell Rabbit House
Makes me feel very happy...

56
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:15,412
Interviewer B

57
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:18,916
sorry

58
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:20,751
Excuse me

59
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:22,836
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

60
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:26,048
Boss C

61
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:44,733
Misa

62
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,152
Do you want to watch the World Cup together?

63
00:08:47,236 --> 00:08:48,946
-football?
- Not football.

64
00:08:49,321 --> 00:08:50,948
I'm going to talk to my friends on the college football team

65
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:52,699
Go to a sports bar to watch a game

66
00:08:52,783 --> 00:08:55,786
- I want to introduce you to each other
- What? I'll be nervous.

67
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:58,914
- Do I understand the rules?
- Don't worry, I'll teach you.

68
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:01,416
The extra standing in the corner with no lines

69
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:03,710
- Your birthday present
-What?

70
00:09:04,503 --> 00:09:06,546
- You have to wear it to work
- Yeah, thanks.

71
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:08,382
You two are so slow.

72
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:10,050
- We have a reservation.
-Feel sorry

73
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:11,593
Sorry, the section chief won't let us go.

74
00:09:11,677 --> 00:09:12,511
Let's go

75
00:09:12,844 --> 00:09:14,596
Oops, I'm starving.

76
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,140
I will never appear in her story

77
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,268
That's how it should have been.

78
00:09:20,978 --> 00:09:24,189
But on September 18, 2015…

79
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:29,486
Excuse me

80
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:32,531
She suddenly swooped over

81
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:40,789
sorry

82
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:44,293
I said terrible things because I was so flustered.

83
00:09:45,544 --> 00:09:47,504
That scarf doesn't suit you.

84
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:51,717
Please wait for it to cool down.

85
00:10:01,685 --> 00:10:03,061
I'm really sorry

86
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,604
Minister Suzuki

87
00:10:09,484 --> 00:10:13,280
I'm sorry for saying something rude to you.

88
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:16,992
Me too

89
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:23,832
(Minister Suzuki)

90
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:31,965
What to do Kame-Kichi?

91
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:34,343
New progress has emerged

92
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:02,621
Good morning

93
00:11:04,456 --> 00:11:05,582
morning

94
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:07,209
Your burns...

95
00:11:19,513 --> 00:11:22,391
-Good morning, everyone.
-Good morning

96
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,609
Good morning, Misa

97
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:36,071
I have disliked you since I was a child

98
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,073
We have never been friends

99
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:41,284
Good morning, Rina

100
00:11:41,785 --> 00:11:44,538
Congratulations again on your engagement.

101
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:46,581
Thanks

102
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:52,254
You were just talking to the business strategy department.
Minister Suzuki, are you going to say anything?

103
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:53,964
yes

104
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:55,632
When did you first meet?

105
00:11:56,425 --> 00:11:59,302
On the day of the briefing
I accidentally bumped into him in the elevator

106
00:11:59,845 --> 00:12:01,304
Right

107
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:05,809
So you and the rich kid
The relationship is so good that they greet each other.

108
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:07,769
Very good

109
00:12:07,853 --> 00:12:10,272
You actually let the rich kid know you

110
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:12,899
-Rich kid?
- Minister Suzuki

111
00:12:12,983 --> 00:12:15,068
He is the grandson of the chairman and the son of the general manager.

112
00:12:15,152 --> 00:12:16,153
What?

113
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:18,280
-Isn't he handsome?
-right

114
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:21,116
I heard that he filmed our company's commercial when he was a kid.

115
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:22,033
I have seen it online

116
00:12:22,117 --> 00:12:23,243
That ad?

117
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:24,161
right

118
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:28,331
He is very capable at work.
A bit cool but also charming

119
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:29,833
He is single, right?

120
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:31,126
Rich Kids…

121
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:34,796
Back to the point
There was indeed a boss with this nickname before.

122
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,214
It was him

123
00:12:36,298 --> 00:12:38,758
Misa, are you tired of hearing this?

124
00:12:39,384 --> 00:12:42,053
After all, you have no interest in company gossip.

125
00:12:44,139 --> 00:12:45,223
Esaka

126
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:48,477
Quotation

127
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,561
How's the progress?

128
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,898
I'm starting now

129
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:55,734
Didn’t I ask you to finish it last week?

130
00:12:57,319 --> 00:13:00,530
Sorry, I have so many other things on my plate.

131
00:13:01,323 --> 00:13:03,325
Jiang Ban, please keep your promise

132
00:13:04,743 --> 00:13:07,662
You are now qualified to teach new people.
So please pay more attention.

133
00:13:08,663 --> 00:13:11,750
Okay, I'll be careful.

134
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:14,544
Sumiyoshi, you're wearing a new suit.

135
00:13:14,628 --> 00:13:15,545
right

136
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:18,965
Because the mortgage is crushing me.

137
00:13:19,049 --> 00:13:20,634
I haven't bought new clothes for a long time.

138
00:13:42,197 --> 00:13:43,240
Misa, you've worked hard.

139
00:13:43,949 --> 00:13:44,866
You've worked hard too.

140
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:45,867
Have you read the information?

141
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:47,494
information?

142
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:52,999
(I looked for a bunch of wedding venues
Check out these links!)

143
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:55,085
Let's go

144
00:14:07,222 --> 00:14:09,140
I always feel it's incredible

145
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:12,227
No one here knows anything about us

146
00:14:12,686 --> 00:14:13,520
Unbelievable?

147
00:14:14,396 --> 00:14:15,480
I mean...

148
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:21,611
No one knows you are my fiancée

149
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:27,742
Give me curry rice, please!

150
00:14:28,451 --> 00:14:29,995
alright

151
00:14:38,753 --> 00:14:40,797
I'll stay at your house tonight.

152
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:44,551
I started

153
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:47,596
start

154
00:14:48,763 --> 00:14:49,889
So disgusting

155
00:14:49,973 --> 00:14:52,434
I don't want to breathe the same air as him.

156
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:56,521
curry…

157
00:14:58,148 --> 00:15:00,525
Why do you think I married you?

158
00:15:00,609 --> 00:15:02,819
The reason why I'm like you
An inconspicuous and boring woman gets married

159
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:05,363
It's because you are stingy and save money.

160
00:15:06,448 --> 00:15:08,575
"Why should I marry you?"

161
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:13,038
I will never marry this person

162
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,457
Oh, Misa.

163
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:19,461
The last time we watched football at a sports bar
You left early, right?

164
00:15:20,503 --> 00:15:21,713
right

165
00:15:21,796 --> 00:15:23,673
You must be feeling ashamed, right?

166
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:25,425
Ashamed?

167
00:15:26,009 --> 00:15:31,181
After all, compared to the girls around me
To be honest, you are not impressive.

168
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:33,183
I can understand why you're upset.

169
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:37,646
But we are not compatible
What others think doesn’t matter

170
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:39,773
Don't lose confidence

171
00:15:41,483 --> 00:15:43,485
Because the person I chose is you

172
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:47,739
You are too high up.

173
00:15:48,823 --> 00:15:51,451
I can't wait for you to meet my mom.

174
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:53,703
When do you want to meet the parents?

175
00:15:55,038 --> 00:15:55,914
Meet the parents...

176
00:15:55,997 --> 00:16:01,294
You can continue to work
But you can't use work as an excuse not to do housework.

177
00:16:01,753 --> 00:16:04,589
Can I show a gynecological and obstetric diagnosis before getting married?

178
00:16:04,673 --> 00:16:08,426
It turns out that women without parents are useless.

179
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:09,928
When is the offer?

180
00:16:10,512 --> 00:16:12,514
My mother is very busy.

181
00:16:14,265 --> 00:16:17,143
How come I didn't see through this guy's true face?

182
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:21,189
Look at this

183
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:22,982
This sticker is so funny

184
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:27,654
He has an Oedipus complex and is self-centered
Emotional blackmail

185
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:30,281
Do you know cryptocurrency?

186
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:35,203
Put the money in the bank now
Just a waste of money and time

187
00:16:35,286 --> 00:16:38,623
There is a kind of Duruchis coin that ordinary people can't buy

188
00:16:38,707 --> 00:16:42,001
But the senior from the football team introduced me to the way

189
00:16:42,085 --> 00:16:43,336
Right

190
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:44,629
That's a scam

191
00:16:44,713 --> 00:16:46,840
He will be cheated out of all his money.

192
00:16:47,215 --> 00:16:50,260
He's also a super narcissist.

193
00:16:51,302 --> 00:16:52,804
I want to beat myself up

194
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:54,639
Why am I so ignorant of people?

195
00:16:57,892 --> 00:16:59,686
I envy you guys for having such a good relationship.

196
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:00,729
Rina

197
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:05,400
I'm leaving soon. Sit over there.

198
00:17:05,984 --> 00:17:06,901
Why?

199
00:17:07,277 --> 00:17:08,570
Wait, someone is looking for me.

200
00:17:08,653 --> 00:17:10,238
So you just sit there.

201
00:17:14,284 --> 00:17:16,786
I finally finished the quotation.

202
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:18,413
Youya, listen to me

203
00:17:18,872 --> 00:17:19,706
What's wrong?

204
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:24,627
Newcomers have poor working ability
I've been helping her with things.

205
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:26,713
But Deputy Section Chief Sumiyoshi was very tolerant of her.

206
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:29,424
Only super strict with me

207
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:33,052
Because I'm a contract employee
She used me as a punching bag to vent her stress

208
00:17:33,136 --> 00:17:33,970
Right?

209
00:17:35,263 --> 00:17:36,097
Um…

210
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,892
Lina, you are so pitiful.

211
00:17:39,309 --> 00:17:41,936
This is work, so I can only cheer up.

212
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:43,688
Lina, you are so sensible.

213
00:17:44,272 --> 00:17:46,065
But you should speak up.

214
00:17:46,149 --> 00:17:47,567
You're just too nice.

215
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:49,736
Thanks

216
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:52,906
Only you and Misa understand me

217
00:17:54,115 --> 00:17:55,074
I started

218
00:17:56,493 --> 00:17:59,078
What can I do to get these two people married?

219
00:17:59,662 --> 00:18:03,750
They will have an affair in ten years
So there shouldn't be no chance now.

220
00:18:10,173 --> 00:18:11,341
What's wrong?

221
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:13,259
Yeah, I'm having lunch.

222
00:18:13,968 --> 00:18:17,096
- Lina has a fiancé at this time
- I'm eating curry

223
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:18,223
-Yes.
-Really?

224
00:18:18,306 --> 00:18:19,349
Please give me a large cup.

225
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:23,186
The other party is a boyfriend with excellent conditions
Working in an advertising agency

226
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:24,437
In contrast…

227
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:29,067
He doesn't do housework and has no future

228
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:32,278
Self-evaluation is like a daily limit
Oedipus complex

229
00:18:33,196 --> 00:18:34,322
No, he can't win.

230
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:38,576
nothing

231
00:18:40,078 --> 00:18:42,997
Sorry, I was talking to someone. What's wrong?

232
00:18:43,081 --> 00:18:45,959
But as long as he doesn't speak
Looks pretty handsome

233
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:48,670
Reina, please discover Tomoya's charm.

234
00:18:48,753 --> 00:18:50,296
Can you spare the time?

235
00:18:51,256 --> 00:18:52,674
So happy

236
00:18:52,757 --> 00:18:56,219
He is a nice guy when he is in a good mood.
And he plays rugby so he's got good stamina

237
00:18:56,553 --> 00:18:58,346
Treat him as a human being and you will have expectations

238
00:18:58,429 --> 00:19:02,600
But if you regard him as willful and reckless
A dog that loves to act like a spoiled child and bites people when it is unhappy...

239
00:19:03,226 --> 00:19:05,520
Why would I marry a man like this?

240
00:19:07,105 --> 00:19:08,064
Look

241
00:19:10,567 --> 00:19:12,402
You two really match each other.

242
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:15,989
You two seem like a perfect match.

243
00:19:17,407 --> 00:19:18,533
no

244
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:21,911
She really looked down on both of us.

245
00:19:22,287 --> 00:19:25,665
Next time, invite your boyfriend and the four of us to drink together

246
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:28,835
He is very busy

247
00:19:28,918 --> 00:19:30,169
That's right

248
00:19:30,253 --> 00:19:31,421
There is still a chance

249
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:33,423
The boyfriend at the advertising agency has a real girlfriend

250
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:34,799
Damn scumbag!

251
00:19:34,883 --> 00:19:35,717
Rina

252
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,761
After she found out that he was cheating on her
They argued about this for months.

253
00:19:38,845 --> 00:19:41,264
Then Reina got dumped on Christmas Eve

254
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:44,142
Give me back my time!

255
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:47,937
Lina is about to break up with her boyfriend

256
00:19:48,021 --> 00:19:48,938
Opportunity is here

257
00:20:02,076 --> 00:20:04,245
My stomach is full

258
00:20:05,163 --> 00:20:06,831
I'm stuffed

259
00:20:09,459 --> 00:20:10,919
Wait, what is this?

260
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:16,633
I remember

261
00:20:16,716 --> 00:20:18,259
I'm stuffed

262
00:20:24,807 --> 00:20:26,643
-sorry
-Are you okay?

263
00:20:27,185 --> 00:20:29,187
-what to do?
- I didn't notice it myself

264
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:31,731
I'm really sorry for such a nice suit.

265
00:20:31,814 --> 00:20:33,149
I'll get something to wipe it.

266
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,360
- What a disaster
-yes

267
00:20:38,196 --> 00:20:39,280
Now I understand

268
00:20:40,323 --> 00:20:42,450
She did it on purpose

269
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:45,870
-Are you leaving?
-Deputy Section Chief Sumiyoshi!

270
00:20:52,877 --> 00:20:54,587
Hey! Really?

271
00:20:54,671 --> 00:20:56,130
I'm sorry, friends!

272
00:20:56,214 --> 00:20:58,299
Are you kidding me?

273
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,885
I'm sorry, it was Misa who suddenly rushed out.

274
00:21:01,469 --> 00:21:03,096
Hirano, are you okay?

275
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:04,138
-Um…
-Are you okay?

276
00:21:04,222 --> 00:21:06,557
Sure enough, what is supposed to happen will still happen.

277
00:21:06,641 --> 00:21:07,475
I'm sorry

278
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,728
But if there is a replacement...

279
00:21:11,938 --> 00:21:13,690
This is expensive

280
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:14,983
sorry

281
00:21:15,066 --> 00:21:16,901
- Can't be wiped off
-Destiny can be changed

282
00:21:16,985 --> 00:21:18,820
-what to do?
-I really...

283
00:21:18,903 --> 00:21:21,030
It's really bad.

284
00:21:21,114 --> 00:21:23,408
This suit and shirt are very expensive.

285
00:21:23,491 --> 00:21:24,867
Sorry, Tomoya

286
00:21:25,326 --> 00:21:26,703
Let me compensate you

287
00:21:28,037 --> 00:21:29,163
Need not

288
00:21:30,498 --> 00:21:31,666
It doesn't matter

289
00:21:31,749 --> 00:21:33,167
You didn't mean it.

290
00:21:33,751 --> 00:21:35,336
I should clean it immediately.

291
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:37,171
Or send it for dry cleaning

292
00:21:37,714 --> 00:21:39,298
I don’t know if it can be washed off?

293
00:21:41,092 --> 00:21:41,926
what?

294
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:43,928
What are you doing?

295
00:21:44,971 --> 00:21:46,973
Why are you giving it to me?

296
00:21:47,056 --> 00:21:49,267
- You take it to wash.
- Is this your suit?

297
00:21:56,441 --> 00:21:57,275
Very good

298
00:21:57,692 --> 00:22:00,403
I finally said what I wanted to say to him.

299
00:22:00,486 --> 00:22:02,947
Is this the first time? It should be the first time

300
00:22:03,031 --> 00:22:05,491
I am different from the first time I lived.

301
00:22:21,466 --> 00:22:22,800
I can start over

302
00:22:23,968 --> 00:22:26,512
After all, I finally got ten years younger.

303
00:22:30,266 --> 00:22:31,517
Excuse me

304
00:22:32,602 --> 00:22:33,436
What's up?

305
00:22:34,145 --> 00:22:34,979
that…

306
00:22:36,814 --> 00:22:38,191
What's wrong?

307
00:22:38,816 --> 00:22:41,652
I have an emergency

308
00:22:42,278 --> 00:22:43,988
Could it be that...

309
00:22:44,405 --> 00:22:46,157
That's right.

310
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,784
I'll get it to you right away.

311
00:22:49,952 --> 00:22:51,204
Thanks for your help

312
00:22:52,288 --> 00:22:55,083
I thought I would never be able to leave the bathroom.

313
00:22:55,166 --> 00:22:56,751
Don't say that

314
00:22:56,834 --> 00:22:59,712
The restroom on that floor is inexplicably rarely used.

315
00:23:00,463 --> 00:23:04,133
I also asked others for help but they ignored me.

316
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:05,760
Ignore you?

317
00:23:05,843 --> 00:23:08,387
I heard someone leaving while talking on the phone

318
00:23:09,013 --> 00:23:11,140
That person is definitely Jiang Ban

319
00:23:12,767 --> 00:23:15,019
I'm so sorry

320
00:23:16,104 --> 00:23:17,814
Why are you apologizing?

321
00:23:20,108 --> 00:23:23,361
If someone messes with me, I will definitely fight back

322
00:23:23,444 --> 00:23:24,529
So I'm fine

323
00:23:26,948 --> 00:23:28,282
The same is true when you get help

324
00:23:29,117 --> 00:23:29,951
What?

325
00:23:30,034 --> 00:23:31,994
You are my benefactor

326
00:23:32,078 --> 00:23:34,413
I will definitely repay you

327
00:23:40,628 --> 00:23:41,546
(Bean Game Hall)

328
00:23:41,629 --> 00:23:43,297
-This is delicious too
-Hello

329
00:23:43,381 --> 00:23:45,133
-Welcome
-welcome

330
00:23:46,175 --> 00:23:47,009
Same old thing?

331
00:23:47,093 --> 00:23:48,594
- Bean turtle tea set
-good

332
00:23:48,678 --> 00:23:50,721
- Please go up to the second floor
-OK

333
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:53,057
- I'm going to prepare now
-Thanks

334
00:23:56,602 --> 00:23:57,979
Sorry for the long wait

335
00:23:58,062 --> 00:23:59,480
Thanks

336
00:24:00,148 --> 00:24:01,440
Please use slowly

337
00:24:05,111 --> 00:24:06,279
I started

338
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:23,754
This always makes me feel at ease.

339
00:24:54,827 --> 00:24:55,661
Hello

340
00:24:56,078 --> 00:24:56,913
Hello

341
00:24:57,872 --> 00:25:00,416
I said something very rude the other day.

342
00:25:00,917 --> 00:25:02,126
A few days ago?

343
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:06,255
I'm the one who shouldn't apologize.

344
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:09,634
So you two are friends.

345
00:25:32,323 --> 00:25:33,616
Please use slowly

346
00:25:39,705 --> 00:25:42,708
-May I?
- What? Can you please take a seat?

347
00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:52,551
-that…
-that…

348
00:25:54,053 --> 00:25:55,137
- Please speak
- No, you say it first

349
00:25:55,221 --> 00:25:56,347
No, you say it first.

350
00:25:59,225 --> 00:26:01,143
How is your burn?

351
00:26:02,853 --> 00:26:04,522
No big deal

352
00:26:05,898 --> 00:26:07,108
Do you come here often?

353
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:09,610
I come when I want to be alone.

354
00:26:12,238 --> 00:26:13,572
No, that's not what I meant.

355
00:26:14,365 --> 00:26:16,617
This is the shop my dad brought me to.

356
00:26:18,703 --> 00:26:19,787
Your father?

357
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:20,788
right

358
00:26:21,122 --> 00:26:23,374
I feel safe when I come here

359
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:25,793
Minister Suzuki, what about you?

360
00:26:27,169 --> 00:26:28,879
I found this store while doing research

361
00:26:30,006 --> 00:26:32,800
Sometimes I will organize market research reports here

362
00:26:33,426 --> 00:26:34,552
Market research?

363
00:26:45,855 --> 00:26:47,565
（Store product evaluation）

364
00:26:47,648 --> 00:26:49,734
“It’s better to visit people in person than to study the information”

365
00:26:49,817 --> 00:26:51,902
This is what the president taught me.

366
00:26:52,737 --> 00:26:54,363
It's your grandfather, right?

367
00:26:55,197 --> 00:26:57,366
-What?
- I heard from my colleague today

368
00:26:58,909 --> 00:27:00,036
So that's it

369
00:27:04,248 --> 00:27:06,292
Did you know that Bell Rabbit Holdings

370
00:27:06,834 --> 00:27:11,047
A Japanese confectionery shop originating from Sendagi
The "Bell Rabbit House"?

371
00:27:11,339 --> 00:27:12,173
I know

372
00:27:12,715 --> 00:27:16,344
My dad likes the red bean daifuku at Suzutoya very much

373
00:27:16,761 --> 00:27:18,721
That is the taste that has been passed down from the first generation.

374
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:20,848
The same taste...

375
00:27:22,099 --> 00:27:25,061
I think it's great. So is the strawberry milk candy.

376
00:27:27,521 --> 00:27:28,689
Childhood

377
00:27:28,773 --> 00:27:30,900
The moment you put the candy in your mouth

378
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:32,610
Do you believe it?

379
00:27:34,862 --> 00:27:38,407
Oh, I remember the advertisement of Bell Rabbit House.

380
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:42,453
Minister, you are the little boy dancing with the bell rabbit, right?

381
00:27:43,412 --> 00:27:47,124
Who told you about this?

382
00:27:47,208 --> 00:27:48,417
It's my colleague.

383
00:27:49,126 --> 00:27:51,754
I miss you so much
I don't know if I can still find that ad...

384
00:27:51,837 --> 00:27:54,256
Please don't search

385
00:27:56,175 --> 00:27:57,343
That's my dark history.

386
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:00,846
sorry

387
00:28:03,307 --> 00:28:06,102
You don’t know “that” either, do you?

388
00:28:07,978 --> 00:28:08,813
"that"?

389
00:28:10,523 --> 00:28:13,984
What people call me behind my back

390
00:28:17,905 --> 00:28:19,698
Rich kid?

391
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:28,624
I thought the rich kid
Only appears in girls' comics or Korean dramas

392
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:30,084
I didn't expect it really existed.

393
00:28:30,751 --> 00:28:32,795
-Are you making fun of me?
-No

394
00:28:32,878 --> 00:28:36,340
That's a good idea.
Everyone means well when they say it.

395
00:28:36,424 --> 00:28:37,425
Good meaning?

396
00:28:37,508 --> 00:28:39,718
After all, rich kids are usually very cold.

397
00:28:39,802 --> 00:28:42,680
But no matter where the heroine gets into trouble
He will come to rescue her.

398
00:28:42,763 --> 00:28:44,223
This is everyone's dream

399
00:28:46,684 --> 00:28:48,352
And everyone said

400
00:28:48,436 --> 00:28:50,688
Minister, you are very capable at work. It's really amazing.

401
00:28:53,274 --> 00:28:55,276
The reason why I got my current position

402
00:28:57,945 --> 00:29:00,739
Of course it's not because of my strength

403
00:29:02,408 --> 00:29:03,242
But…

404
00:29:10,791 --> 00:29:14,253
You really like Japanese confectionery, right?

405
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:20,718
I also like the sweet potato yokan in this store.

406
00:29:25,681 --> 00:29:26,724
Here

407
00:29:28,225 --> 00:29:29,643
Can I see it?

408
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:31,395
Please feel free to

409
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:36,025
(Ginza "Karia Matcha")

410
00:29:36,108 --> 00:29:39,445
Compared with your information
Mine is like a child's doodle

411
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:45,826
Nowadays, just search online
It seems that all the information can be found

412
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:48,871
But you visit the store and experience it yourself

413
00:29:49,997 --> 00:29:53,167
Whether it is the aroma, taste or the atmosphere in the store

414
00:29:54,376 --> 00:29:58,839
This information obtained through your five senses
Absolutely irreplaceable

415
00:29:59,632 --> 00:30:05,095
I think there's nothing wrong with the way you do things.

416
00:30:13,229 --> 00:30:14,146
but…

417
00:30:15,397 --> 00:30:19,485
Compared to Sakura Hall, I recommend the Jintsuba of Gangan.

418
00:30:20,945 --> 00:30:22,947
I can't agree with this

419
00:30:23,447 --> 00:30:24,448
minister

420
00:30:24,532 --> 00:30:26,742
What do you think of Kawataya's soy sauce dumplings?
Why is the rating so low?

421
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:28,160
It's obviously delicious

422
00:30:28,244 --> 00:30:29,995
The sauce tastes too strong

423
00:30:30,079 --> 00:30:32,748
The taste needs to be lighter to be popular with the public

424
00:30:33,624 --> 00:30:34,583
Senzaki

425
00:30:34,667 --> 00:30:35,668
Is the only choice

426
00:30:35,751 --> 00:30:38,462
Senzaki's soy sauce dumplings are indeed delicious but...

427
00:30:38,546 --> 00:30:39,797
Have you been there?

428
00:30:40,464 --> 00:30:41,882
I've been

429
00:30:41,966 --> 00:30:44,134
-I remember the main store is in Kyoto, right?
-right

430
00:30:44,218 --> 00:30:46,345
But the Tokyo branch is also good

431
00:30:47,972 --> 00:30:49,974
Speaking of Kyoto

432
00:30:50,057 --> 00:30:53,978
Gion Keika limited time offer
The co-branded Japanese-style cafe opens this week

433
00:30:54,061 --> 00:30:57,523
I wanted to go but was too busy with work...

434
00:31:00,234 --> 00:31:04,446
Not what I said before.
I mean you have to go.

435
00:31:06,115 --> 00:31:08,659
(Reina shopping at 17:00)

436
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:11,870
On this day…

437
00:31:12,621 --> 00:31:14,415
Isn't this place great?

438
00:31:14,498 --> 00:31:17,167
Well, it's so rare for us to have a meal at the hotel.

439
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:18,877
Everyone is here

440
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:21,005
Rina

441
00:31:22,131 --> 00:31:23,757
haven't seen you for a long time

442
00:31:24,383 --> 00:31:26,093
how so?

443
00:31:26,176 --> 00:31:28,512
Today is a class reunion

444
00:31:28,596 --> 00:31:30,764
If I had told you in advance you wouldn't have come, right?

445
00:31:32,808 --> 00:31:35,519
-Long time no see, Reina
-haven't seen you for a long time

446
00:31:35,603 --> 00:31:38,689
I'm fine. How are you guys?

447
00:31:44,361 --> 00:31:46,447
Reina, do you work at Suzutoya?

448
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:47,906
I changed the company.

449
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:49,700
So cool

450
00:31:49,783 --> 00:31:50,618
Really?

451
00:31:50,701 --> 00:31:52,786
Lina, where is your boyfriend from the advertising company?

452
00:31:53,412 --> 00:31:55,331
-Wait what?
- I haven't heard of it.

453
00:31:55,497 --> 00:31:56,457
What?

454
00:31:56,540 --> 00:32:00,294
I may be here soon
There will be news to announce to everyone

455
00:32:10,262 --> 00:32:12,514
Where did Kobe escape to?

456
00:32:12,598 --> 00:32:14,975
In the blink of an eye, it disappeared

457
00:32:15,059 --> 00:32:17,770
She's still as gloomy as ever

458
00:32:17,853 --> 00:32:20,064
As long as she is there, the atmosphere is heavy

459
00:32:20,898 --> 00:32:24,109
Why would Reina be friends with someone like that?

460
00:32:24,193 --> 00:32:27,154
Lina is so nice

461
00:32:28,072 --> 00:32:30,991
Kobe actually dared to show up

462
00:32:31,075 --> 00:32:32,951
Obviously did something too much

463
00:32:33,035 --> 00:32:34,828
- That's what I mean
-real

464
00:32:34,912 --> 00:32:37,122
Are you guys going too far?

465
00:32:37,206 --> 00:32:38,749
-But it's true.
-Yes.

466
00:32:38,832 --> 00:32:40,668
That woman is so thick-skinned

467
00:32:46,632 --> 00:32:47,800
Misa

468
00:32:49,802 --> 00:32:51,303
Are you really going home?

469
00:32:52,054 --> 00:32:55,557
Sorry, I'm not feeling well.

470
00:33:06,193 --> 00:33:07,361
“You did something so excessive.”

471
00:33:07,444 --> 00:33:08,362

Tanabe-san?

481
00:33:58,036 --> 00:34:00,080
Sorry for sending you a private message out of the blue

482
00:34:00,164 --> 00:34:02,750
I am your classmate at Toyama Chuo High School
Tanabe Yuto

483
00:34:02,833 --> 00:34:04,835
This book is very interesting. You can take a look at it.

484
00:34:05,586 --> 00:34:09,256
I would like to contact you
Because there's something that's been bothering me.

485
00:34:09,339 --> 00:34:12,092
It's about a letter that Reina Esaka gave me

486
00:34:12,176 --> 00:34:13,594
Share your thoughts with me after reading this

487
00:34:13,677 --> 00:34:16,430
I was shocked by what you said at that time.

488
00:34:16,513 --> 00:34:18,474
But then the more I thought about it, the more I felt

489
00:34:18,557 --> 00:34:21,894
You can't write that kind of letter.

490
00:34:21,977 --> 00:34:23,729
Can we talk?

491
00:34:23,812 --> 00:34:24,772
I am so happy

492
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:27,900
letter?

493
00:34:30,027 --> 00:34:32,112
Misa, let's go back.

494
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,281
good

495
00:34:35,908 --> 00:34:36,742
Then I'm leaving

496
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:39,369
Goodbye

497
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:40,996
goodbye

498
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:43,957
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

499
00:34:45,292 --> 00:34:46,543
What are you talking about?

500
00:34:47,044 --> 00:34:50,547
He asked me if I was interested in joining the drama club.

501
00:34:50,964 --> 00:34:53,091
He showed me the script for the next performance

502
00:34:53,175 --> 00:34:54,510
The content is really interesting

503
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:57,596
Are you planning on performing on stage?

504
00:34:58,722 --> 00:35:00,015
No

505
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:03,143
I just want to help out behind the scenes.

506
00:35:03,227 --> 00:35:05,771
That doesn't suit you, so forget it.

507
00:35:06,688 --> 00:35:09,858
Girls think Tanabe Yuuto is disgusting

508
00:35:10,609 --> 00:35:12,110
If you hang out with that kind of people

509
00:35:12,194 --> 00:35:15,405
I'm worried that people will misunderstand you and him as the same kind.

510
00:35:19,034 --> 00:35:21,703
Although I know nothing about drama

511
00:35:21,787 --> 00:35:23,413
But I think it's great

512
00:35:23,497 --> 00:35:25,749
Glad to hear that. Thanks.

513
00:35:25,833 --> 00:35:27,751
Can you give me your contact information?

514
00:35:27,835 --> 00:35:28,961
sure

515
00:35:31,255 --> 00:35:33,048
I just haven't got your contact information yet.

516
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:34,341
-Yeah?
-right

517
00:35:34,842 --> 00:35:35,843
Very good

518
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:38,178
for you

519
00:35:38,262 --> 00:35:39,555
That’s when it started

520
00:35:42,015 --> 00:35:44,977
The whole class started to ignore me.

521
00:35:45,853 --> 00:35:47,020
Kobe is so lonely

522
00:35:47,563 --> 00:35:50,524
- Stop it.
-Um

523
00:35:51,567 --> 00:35:53,694
Eating alone

524
00:35:54,069 --> 00:35:55,612
She will hear it.

525
00:36:04,121 --> 00:36:06,206
(Keep studying! Dad left it to me)

526
00:36:10,878 --> 00:36:12,004
- Look
-good

527
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:17,885
Feel sorry

528
00:36:17,968 --> 00:36:20,804
I tried to open the window but accidentally bumped into it.

529
00:36:23,307 --> 00:36:25,058
So pitiful

530
00:36:25,142 --> 00:36:27,644
Lina, do you want to have dinner with us?

531
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:29,021
good

532
00:36:29,104 --> 00:36:30,022
Come on over here

533
00:36:31,607 --> 00:36:32,858
I'll get you a chair.

534
00:36:35,986 --> 00:36:36,820
Rina

535
00:36:38,488 --> 00:36:40,073
- Your bento is so cute
- So cute

536
00:36:40,157 --> 00:36:42,200
- The lunch box is too small
-How come?

537
00:36:42,284 --> 00:36:45,454
- It doesn't feel enough.
- That's enough.

538
00:36:47,664 --> 00:36:50,167
Wait, I want one too.

539
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:55,589
Too much

540
00:37:16,318 --> 00:37:17,694
Not good

541
00:37:17,778 --> 00:37:19,613
That one doesn't suit you.

542
00:37:20,614 --> 00:37:22,574
This one is the best for you

543
00:37:24,785 --> 00:37:25,911
Good for you

544
00:37:36,505 --> 00:37:38,340
Doesn’t this look great?

545
00:37:38,423 --> 00:37:40,592
It definitely fits your home.

546
00:37:40,676 --> 00:37:42,219
Just buy it back

547
00:38:19,548 --> 00:38:21,133
I feel really good.

548
00:38:28,557 --> 00:38:30,100
By the way, today...

549
00:38:30,559 --> 00:38:35,939
Gion Keika limited time offer
The co-branded Japanese-style cafe opens this week

550
00:38:37,274 --> 00:38:38,150
good

551
00:38:38,233 --> 00:38:40,819
Today I decided to take a one-day food tour

552
00:38:41,361 --> 00:38:44,281
Now that I am healthy, of course I can do what I want to do.

553
00:38:51,872 --> 00:38:53,707
No clothes to wear

554
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:58,170
Clear weather is expected in Kanto today

555
00:38:58,962 --> 00:39:02,966
Good weather with blue sky and white clouds
The daytime high temperature is around 22 degrees

556
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:05,343
The weather is very comfortable

557
00:39:05,427 --> 00:39:08,263
-But the sunlight is stronger at noon...
-Kamekichi, what do you think?

558
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:12,392
Please remember to wear a hat or sunscreen to protect against UV rays

559
00:39:12,476 --> 00:39:15,687
A man who shows up wherever he goes

560
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,399
In real life, he's a stalker.

561
00:39:22,152 --> 00:39:26,031
Northern Japan and Hokuriku
Clear weather due to high pressure

562
00:39:26,114 --> 00:39:29,159
Mostly sunny weather is also expected in western Japan

563
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:32,913
Okinawa is sunny

564
00:39:32,996 --> 00:39:35,999
Perfect for outdoor leisure activities

565
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:40,212
The air is dry and fresh, suitable for going out...

566
00:39:48,845 --> 00:39:51,014
(Japanese confectionery)

567
00:39:52,307 --> 00:39:53,517
How many people are there?

568
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,518
Two

569
00:39:54,601 --> 00:39:56,061
Please wait

570
00:39:56,144 --> 00:39:57,771
How many people are there? One person?

571
00:39:57,854 --> 00:40:00,774
Currently needing a waiting list, can you accept it?

572
00:40:00,857 --> 00:40:02,400
I'll bring the menu right over.

573
00:40:02,484 --> 00:40:04,402
- Sorry, please wait.
-good

574
00:40:04,486 --> 00:40:06,738
-How many people can I ask?
-One

575
00:40:06,822 --> 00:40:11,076
Sorry, but we are currently full.

576
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:13,328
It takes about 30 minutes

577
00:40:14,704 --> 00:40:15,789
that…

578
00:40:18,333 --> 00:40:19,584
If you don't mind

579
00:40:22,003 --> 00:40:24,631
Minister, you are here to investigate as well, right?

580
00:40:25,465 --> 00:40:27,467
Sorry, am I being nosy?

581
00:40:27,926 --> 00:40:31,138
No thanks for saving me time

582
00:40:32,764 --> 00:40:34,182
Thanks

583
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:43,316
Matcha Parfait is a must-order

584
00:40:44,192 --> 00:40:46,361
But there are also bracken cakes and nerikiri…

585
00:40:47,362 --> 00:40:48,572
I want to eat Dorayaki too

586
00:40:51,575 --> 00:40:52,951
There is also yellow body rain

587
00:40:54,077 --> 00:40:56,329
Oops, it's a hard decision

588
00:40:58,290 --> 00:40:59,499
Do you want to share it equally?

589
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:01,501
Equally divided?

590
00:41:02,502 --> 00:41:06,131
So we can try many kinds
The efficiency of the investigation will be better

591
00:41:32,115 --> 00:41:33,241
Thanks

592
00:41:33,992 --> 00:41:35,619
-Come
-Thanks

593
00:41:57,891 --> 00:41:59,893
You like roasted tea, right?

594
00:42:00,894 --> 00:42:02,062
You also drink it at Douguitang

595
00:42:02,771 --> 00:42:03,688
right

596
00:42:04,481 --> 00:42:05,690
Drinking this will make me feel at ease.

597
00:42:06,233 --> 00:42:08,193
But people often say I'm an old man

598
00:42:08,276 --> 00:42:09,611
Who says such a thing?

599
00:42:11,112 --> 00:42:13,490
It's ok, just pretend I didn't say anything

600
00:42:15,408 --> 00:42:16,368
I also like

601
00:42:17,953 --> 00:42:19,788
Roasted tea really makes people feel at ease, right?

602
00:42:23,166 --> 00:42:24,000
right

603
00:42:31,967 --> 00:42:37,555
At first I thought he was cold.
I didn't expect him to be so good.

604
00:42:41,309 --> 00:42:42,143
etc.

605
00:42:42,602 --> 00:42:45,939
He is the president's grandson.
He is handsome and capable at work

606
00:42:46,022 --> 00:42:51,736
This kind of character only appears in girls' comics
Is it possible to meet by chance so frequently?

607
00:43:03,373 --> 00:43:04,291
that…

608
00:43:04,916 --> 00:43:05,917
If you don't mind

609
00:43:07,669 --> 00:43:09,379
I met you so many times in a short period of time.

610
00:43:11,006 --> 00:43:13,258
Did he do it on purpose?

611
00:43:13,883 --> 00:43:15,135
Is he ambushing me?

612
00:43:16,761 --> 00:43:18,096
Think about it

613
00:43:18,179 --> 00:43:20,682
He went a little too far in criticizing me that day.

614
00:43:21,057 --> 00:43:24,185
And like he said, I don't judge people.

615
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:27,397
Whether it's Reina or Tomoya, I only attract bad people

616
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:28,648
I'm a magnet for bad people

617
00:43:29,691 --> 00:43:32,527
No decent person would come near me

618
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:33,987
That is to say, this guy

619
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:36,990
He's probably a super bad guy.

620
00:43:38,658 --> 00:43:40,452
No wonder I always feel like something is wrong

621
00:43:40,535 --> 00:43:43,538
I can't be fooled anymore
Don't make the same mistake again.

622
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:45,915
After all, Youya was very nice to me at the beginning.

623
00:43:45,999 --> 00:43:48,335
He wears the mask of a rich kid.
Actually a stalker?

624
00:43:48,418 --> 00:43:50,837
Bully? Nervous maniac? Psychopath? Sociopath?

625
00:43:52,756 --> 00:43:53,923
How are you?

626
00:43:54,257 --> 00:43:55,091
not good

627
00:43:55,967 --> 00:43:56,801
What?

628
00:43:58,219 --> 00:43:59,846
No, nothing.

629
00:44:10,065 --> 00:44:11,191
Wait, calm down.

630
00:44:11,274 --> 00:44:14,152
He is a rich kid.
There's no way she'd be interested in someone like me.

631
00:44:17,614 --> 00:44:18,782
What's wrong?

632
00:44:19,407 --> 00:44:20,867
No, it's okay.

633
00:44:34,756 --> 00:44:36,257
-Thank you for coming
-Thanks

634
00:44:38,343 --> 00:44:39,594
Really delicious

635
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:40,512
Yes

636
00:44:46,142 --> 00:44:46,976
that…

637
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:49,479
-What's up?
-What are your plans next?

638
00:44:50,313 --> 00:44:51,981
I want to buy some clothes

639
00:44:52,065 --> 00:44:53,024
clothing?

640
00:44:53,942 --> 00:44:57,112
I was so busy organizing that I lost a lot of clothes
No clothes to wear...

641
00:44:57,195 --> 00:44:59,155
-scarf!
-What?

642
00:44:59,572 --> 00:45:02,784
The scarf I made for you a few days ago
I made a very disrespectful comment

643
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:06,121
I lost that scarf.

644
00:45:07,664 --> 00:45:10,417
I'm so sorry

645
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:12,252
No, it's not your fault.

646
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:13,670
If you don't mind...

647
00:45:13,753 --> 00:45:14,587
Please say

648
00:45:15,296 --> 00:45:17,424
I want to buy you a new scarf as an apology

649
00:45:17,507 --> 00:45:19,134
I know a good shop nearby.

650
00:45:20,885 --> 00:45:21,719
What?

651
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,722
(Jiupin Fochuan Greenway)

652
00:45:27,976 --> 00:45:29,436
Just turn the corner and you'll arrive

653
00:45:29,519 --> 00:45:30,353
good

654
00:45:39,904 --> 00:45:41,489
(Top 39,800, Pants 41,000)

655
00:45:44,826 --> 00:45:45,827
that…

656
00:45:46,578 --> 00:45:48,288
I can't afford the expensive shop

657
00:45:49,372 --> 00:45:51,291
This is my apology gift to you for my slip of the tongue.

658
00:45:51,791 --> 00:45:52,625
Need not

659
00:45:53,501 --> 00:45:55,336
I pay for the things I want to buy myself.

660
00:45:57,338 --> 00:45:58,465
So cute

661
00:46:05,722 --> 00:46:07,724
What? Second-hand clothes are so cheap?

662
00:46:08,433 --> 00:46:09,642
Only 500 yen?

663
00:46:09,726 --> 00:46:11,519
-500 yen?
-right

664
00:46:11,603 --> 00:46:12,645
Impossible

665
00:46:12,729 --> 00:46:14,314
It's really amazing

666
00:46:16,232 --> 00:46:18,651
This is my first time in this kind of store

667
00:46:18,735 --> 00:46:19,986
Do you come here often?

668
00:46:20,695 --> 00:46:23,990
I used to come to this kind of store with my mom.

669
00:46:24,073 --> 00:46:25,408
I really can't tell

670
00:46:37,879 --> 00:46:40,590
This yellow sweater suits you very well.

671
00:46:41,591 --> 00:46:44,511
But I don't usually wear bright clothes like this

672
00:46:44,594 --> 00:46:46,971
Really? It looks like a good fit.

673
00:46:47,055 --> 00:46:48,223
Does your boyfriend agree too?

674
00:46:49,057 --> 00:46:50,683
No, he is my boss!

675
00:46:50,767 --> 00:46:52,435
What? That's so funny.

676
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:03,279
Thanks to the minister, I was able to get a bargain.

677
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:04,864
Very good

678
00:47:16,626 --> 00:47:17,669
(88,000 yen)

679
00:47:33,101 --> 00:47:35,061
Shopping is so enjoyable

680
00:47:36,104 --> 00:47:38,147
Was it unhappy before?

681
00:47:39,983 --> 00:47:41,359
Um...yeah

682
00:47:42,485 --> 00:47:44,487
When I cleaned the room

683
00:47:44,571 --> 00:47:48,783
Find clothes I like or want to keep
There isn't even one.

684
00:47:49,909 --> 00:47:54,163
I just realized that I always care about other people's views
Wearing clothes you don't like

685
00:47:55,748 --> 00:47:59,502
That was easier for me at the time.
After all, you don't have to think for yourself

686
00:48:00,503 --> 00:48:03,590
But today I realized how unfortunate that was.

687
00:48:07,635 --> 00:48:09,053
You can start now

688
00:48:09,554 --> 00:48:10,597
Anything is fine

689
00:48:12,515 --> 00:48:14,726
If there is anything that makes you feel regretful

690
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:17,145
Pity…

691
00:48:17,979 --> 00:48:23,192
When I was in the first year of high school, I really wanted to join the drama club.

692
00:48:24,277 --> 00:48:26,571
Although I say that I'd rather be a behind-the-scenes person

693
00:48:26,654 --> 00:48:27,572
But actually…

694
00:48:28,197 --> 00:48:29,782
Do you want to go on stage?

695
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:34,746
I want to try to be a different person.

696
00:48:37,081 --> 00:48:40,501
But I can't join the drama club now

697
00:48:45,590 --> 00:48:47,133
(Rina)

698
00:48:52,889 --> 00:48:53,723
Is it okay if you don’t answer?

699
00:48:56,726 --> 00:48:59,354
Today is our class reunion

700
00:48:59,771 --> 00:49:00,855
But I won't go

701
00:49:06,152 --> 00:49:07,528
Why not go?

702
00:49:09,906 --> 00:49:12,659
They'll say bad things about me anyway.

703
00:49:15,036 --> 00:49:15,870
Again?

704
00:49:16,871 --> 00:49:17,872
fine

705
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:20,667
Because my high school life was not good

706
00:49:21,626 --> 00:49:26,673
Now I can't change the past
I can't get back the three years of high school.

707
00:49:28,466 --> 00:49:32,345
Do you know why cacti have thorns?

708
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:35,264
Cactus thorns?

709
00:49:36,224 --> 00:49:39,519
That's to protect yourself.
Protected from strong sandstorms and scorching sun

710
00:49:39,602 --> 00:49:43,231
and attacks by animals that want to eat them

711
00:49:45,358 --> 00:49:48,736
Cactus cannot move in the desert
Even if the living conditions are extremely unfavorable

712
00:49:49,904 --> 00:49:51,322
Cactus still

713
00:49:51,823 --> 00:49:53,241
Fight in your own way

714
00:49:59,455 --> 00:50:02,667
You might have been helpless in your first year of high school.

715
00:50:04,502 --> 00:50:09,674
But maybe now you have at least one thorn
You can fight back against those who hurt you.

716
00:50:22,478 --> 00:50:24,272
A thorn, eh?

717
00:50:51,174 --> 00:50:52,008
that…

718
00:50:54,635 --> 00:50:55,595
Please accept

719
00:50:55,970 --> 00:50:57,430
I pay you

720
00:50:57,513 --> 00:50:59,265
It's just a small token of my appreciation.

721
00:51:00,141 --> 00:51:01,267
Please accept it

722
00:51:03,603 --> 00:51:05,188
Thanks

723
00:51:16,741 --> 00:51:18,493
Sorry for the long wait

724
00:51:20,995 --> 00:51:24,665
Sorry for asking you out so suddenly
I want to thank you for your help last time

725
00:51:24,749 --> 00:51:26,501
I'm glad you asked me out.

726
00:51:28,336 --> 00:51:29,420
Is he your boyfriend?

727
00:51:29,504 --> 00:51:30,463
Not really

728
00:51:30,546 --> 00:51:33,049
- But you two look like a good match
-No

729
00:51:34,133 --> 00:51:37,011
If I disturb your date
Maybe I should leave?

730
00:51:37,094 --> 00:51:38,638
I'm leaving

731
00:51:38,721 --> 00:51:41,599
Then I'll pass the baton to you.

732
00:51:48,272 --> 00:51:49,273
I think it suits you very well

733
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:53,820
That dress just now

734
00:51:59,283 --> 00:52:00,952
Which dress was it?

735
00:52:15,299 --> 00:52:16,425
Kobe

736
00:52:16,509 --> 00:52:19,303
If it's love at first sight, just buy it.

737
00:52:27,562 --> 00:52:32,400
The money Kobe earns should be spent on himself

738
00:52:34,944 --> 00:52:37,405
The reason why I'm like you
An inconspicuous and boring woman gets married

739
00:52:37,488 --> 00:52:40,157
It's because you are stingy and save money.

740
00:52:42,827 --> 00:52:44,120
you're right

741
00:52:44,912 --> 00:52:45,830
Buy it

742
00:52:47,999 --> 00:52:51,502
- Sorry, I want this one
-OK

743
00:52:55,381 --> 00:52:56,966
You really bought it

744
00:52:57,592 --> 00:52:59,093
-Which one is better?
- So beautiful

745
00:52:59,719 --> 00:53:01,345
Which of these two do you think is better?

746
00:53:04,056 --> 00:53:05,349
-this
-this?

747
00:53:05,433 --> 00:53:07,059
Okay, this is it.

748
00:53:08,352 --> 00:53:09,604
So cute

749
00:53:09,687 --> 00:53:12,023
- I think it suits you.
-Really?

750
00:53:15,192 --> 00:53:19,906
I didn't know you would smile so happily in the future

751
00:53:21,949 --> 00:53:26,162
We've been working together for so long.
I never really knew you.

752
00:53:26,662 --> 00:53:27,914
sorry

753
00:53:31,292 --> 00:53:35,212
I wanted to talk to you more.

754
00:53:36,088 --> 00:53:38,758
But Lina always sticks close to you

755
00:53:38,841 --> 00:53:40,968
Let me stay away from it

756
00:53:43,596 --> 00:53:44,972
-Rina
-Long time no see, Reina

757
00:53:45,056 --> 00:53:50,061
After all, Reina is like a woman's bad qualities

758
00:53:50,144 --> 00:53:52,355
The all-in-one person like espresso

759
00:53:54,649 --> 00:53:58,569
I thought you wanted to be friends with someone like her.

760
00:53:58,653 --> 00:54:01,989
It means you should be the same

761
00:54:02,865 --> 00:54:05,201
-sorry
- No, you're right.

762
00:54:10,915 --> 00:54:12,291
(Rina)

763
00:54:17,505 --> 00:54:18,339
but…

764
00:54:21,425 --> 00:54:23,219
I decided to end it

765
00:54:29,308 --> 00:54:30,142
Sorry for the long wait

766
00:54:30,226 --> 00:54:31,060
Come

767
00:54:32,895 --> 00:54:34,730
Just leave it to him.

768
00:54:34,814 --> 00:54:36,232
His skills are superb

769
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:40,111
I can't wait

770
00:54:44,573 --> 00:54:46,742
Will Kobe really come today?

771
00:54:47,284 --> 00:54:49,996
Yes, but I can't contact her.

772
00:54:50,496 --> 00:54:52,289
After all, Misa is very independent.

773
00:54:52,832 --> 00:54:55,918
Lina, you are really a good person.

774
00:54:56,419 --> 00:54:58,587
She did such a terrible thing to you.

775
00:54:58,963 --> 00:55:01,924
Please don't mention that in front of Misa, okay?

776
00:55:02,341 --> 00:55:04,427
I really don't mind at all

777
00:55:04,927 --> 00:55:07,054
Is everyone ready to drink? Let's drink.

778
00:55:07,388 --> 00:55:08,639
cheers!

779
00:55:08,723 --> 00:55:11,142
cheers!

780
00:55:22,653 --> 00:55:24,280
The stage is set

781
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:44,675
I won't run away this time.

782
00:55:46,177 --> 00:55:47,386
This stage...

783
00:55:48,846 --> 00:55:49,930
It belongs to me

784
00:55:53,184 --> 00:55:54,351
Rina

785
00:55:54,435 --> 00:55:57,438
People who will cancel their appointments on the day
Just ignore her.

786
00:55:57,855 --> 00:56:00,274
Besides, no one wanted to see her.

787
00:56:00,357 --> 00:56:02,318
Just seeing that face is disappointing.

788
00:56:02,401 --> 00:56:03,360
-Yes.
-right

789
00:56:16,665 --> 00:56:18,501
Sorry I'm late

790
00:56:18,959 --> 00:56:20,795
Thank you for asking me to come today.

791
00:56:22,129 --> 00:56:23,172
Kobe?

792
00:56:24,381 --> 00:56:26,759
Sorry to interrupt you.

793
00:56:26,842 --> 00:56:29,428
You are saying bad things about me, please keep going.

794
00:56:31,722 --> 00:56:34,558
You dress too deliberately.

795
00:56:35,226 --> 00:56:37,311
What are you trying to show off?

796
00:56:37,394 --> 00:56:41,107
Kobe, your personality is still as bad as before

797
00:56:42,066 --> 00:56:43,359
I'm here to ask you...

798
00:56:44,568 --> 00:56:46,695
One thing that has always bothered me

799
00:56:47,613 --> 00:56:48,697
I would like to know...

800
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:53,702
Why does everyone hate me?

801
00:56:54,745 --> 00:56:57,623
Why do we hate you?

802
00:56:58,290 --> 00:56:59,625
It's your own fault.

803
00:57:00,584 --> 00:57:01,627
My fault?

804
00:57:02,211 --> 00:57:05,798
- Stop it.
-Kobe, you used to like Yuto, right?

805
00:57:06,549 --> 00:57:11,387
But after Yuto fell in love with Reina
You started to use underhanded tactics to bully Reina.

806
00:57:11,470 --> 00:57:12,972
Everyone knows this.

807
00:57:13,514 --> 00:57:14,348
Insidious means?

808
00:57:14,431 --> 00:57:17,226
You ignore the bad things she says about her online

809
00:57:17,309 --> 00:57:18,936
She also threw away her textbooks

810
00:57:22,106 --> 00:57:23,440
I see

811
00:57:26,694 --> 00:57:28,362
Who told you that?

812
00:57:28,737 --> 00:57:31,740
There's no point in you being evasive
Lina told me this herself.

813
00:57:31,824 --> 00:57:33,576
We are all witnesses

814
00:57:33,659 --> 00:57:37,872
She cried in front of us and said she had endured it for a long time.
It's really sad.

815
00:57:38,664 --> 00:57:39,498
So that's it

816
00:57:39,874 --> 00:57:41,041
And you

817
00:57:41,125 --> 00:57:43,460
I also sent a
Should I write this conceited and disgusting letter to Yuto?

818
00:57:43,544 --> 00:57:45,212
You wrote: "If you follow me again

819
00:57:45,296 --> 00:57:48,007
I will report you to the school and the police."

820
00:57:48,924 --> 00:57:49,925
That's ridiculous.

821
00:57:50,926 --> 00:57:53,387
I didn't write to Tanabe-san.

822
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:55,014
I didn't play dirty tricks on Reina.

823
00:57:55,097 --> 00:57:56,974
- Stop lying.
- That's enough

824
00:58:00,769 --> 00:58:04,398
It happened ten years ago, can we let it go now?

825
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:09,111
If Misa says she doesn't have it, then she doesn't have it.

826
00:58:09,195 --> 00:58:10,988
That's good, right?

827
00:58:11,780 --> 00:58:14,158
We rarely get together

828
00:58:14,241 --> 00:58:16,076
Let's have a drink today.

829
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:17,828
Okay, that's it.

830
00:58:17,912 --> 00:58:19,038
Come drink

831
00:58:19,121 --> 00:58:20,247
How can I just let it go?

832
00:58:20,331 --> 00:58:22,166
It was Kobe who created this atmosphere.

833
00:58:22,249 --> 00:58:24,210
Lina, you should say it to her face.

834
00:58:24,293 --> 00:58:26,378
Forget it, please

835
00:58:27,171 --> 00:58:28,339
Rina

836
00:58:30,925 --> 00:58:32,134
Can you stop now?

837
00:58:34,136 --> 00:58:35,095
What?

838
00:58:35,179 --> 00:58:36,722
Stop pretending to be a good person

839
00:58:36,805 --> 00:58:38,057
Playing the victim

840
00:58:39,975 --> 00:58:42,144
Let's change places

841
00:58:42,228 --> 00:58:43,896
It's really uncomfortable to have her around.

842
00:58:43,979 --> 00:58:45,105
Terrible

843
00:58:46,148 --> 00:58:48,609
Is it fun to ruin a class reunion?

844
00:58:48,692 --> 00:58:49,777
-Hello
- Let's go, Reina

845
00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:51,362
-Change the place to have a drink
- Let's go

846
00:58:51,445 --> 00:58:55,991
I agree with drinking happily
But let me tell you one thing

847
00:58:59,328 --> 00:59:04,458
I have never liked Esaka-san in my life.

848
00:59:09,838 --> 00:59:10,881
Kobe classmate

849
00:59:12,424 --> 00:59:17,846
I'm sorry I didn't believe you.

850
00:59:24,228 --> 00:59:25,396
I…

851
00:59:27,898 --> 00:59:29,066
I just...

852
00:59:30,859 --> 00:59:34,196
When I was in high school, I just kept asking everyone

853
00:59:36,907 --> 00:59:38,575
What did I do?

854
00:59:39,994 --> 00:59:42,162
What did I do to make people hate me?

855
00:59:44,873 --> 00:59:46,375
But I can't ask

856
00:59:47,626 --> 00:59:50,087
Because I think it must be my own fault

857
00:59:55,718 --> 00:59:57,136
But now

858
00:59:57,219 --> 00:59:59,763
I just want to praise myself in high school

859
00:59:59,847 --> 01:00:01,473
I don't hang out with people like you.

860
01:00:01,890 --> 01:00:04,018
Obviously I can't do anything by myself

861
01:00:04,101 --> 01:00:06,729
They only unite to attack others

862
01:00:06,812 --> 01:00:09,023
I'm really glad I'm not friends with this kind of person.

863
01:00:14,987 --> 01:00:16,071
Rina

864
01:00:17,823 --> 01:00:18,991
I don't need you

865
01:00:19,908 --> 01:00:22,619
I don't need friends who hurt others and don't care

866
01:00:23,787 --> 01:00:25,539
People who build their happiness on the suffering of others

867
01:00:25,622 --> 01:00:26,582
Not a friend

868
01:00:28,459 --> 01:00:29,877
So I don't need you

869
01:00:30,878 --> 01:00:32,421
Because I believe in my future life

870
01:00:33,464 --> 01:00:36,133
I can make as many friends as I want.

871
01:01:13,212 --> 01:01:14,296
Why?

872
01:01:15,881 --> 01:01:18,342
Why do you always show up?

873
01:01:19,551 --> 01:01:22,262
Although I'm not a stalker nor a rich kid

874
01:01:34,233 --> 01:01:36,527
But at least I can hold an umbrella for you.

875
01:02:10,978 --> 01:02:12,187
I think it suits you very well

876
01:02:14,815 --> 01:02:16,442
That dress just now

877
01:02:44,136 --> 01:02:46,180
Don't look at me like that.

878
01:02:48,098 --> 01:02:50,350
I know I went too far.

879
01:02:52,436 --> 01:02:54,062
What did you do that was too much?

880
01:02:55,397 --> 01:02:56,773
You are here

881
01:02:58,150 --> 01:03:00,152
Welcome home, I want some tea.

882
01:03:01,737 --> 01:03:02,905
Is roasted tea okay?

883
01:03:04,072 --> 01:03:06,200
Don't be like an old man

884
01:03:43,487 --> 01:03:44,530
yes

885
01:03:49,952 --> 01:03:50,953
morning

886
01:03:51,495 --> 01:03:52,829
I have something to tell you

887
01:03:54,122 --> 01:03:55,374
Let's break up

888
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:58,293
"Huh" what?

889
01:03:58,377 --> 01:04:00,295
Do you have another woman?

890
01:04:00,879 --> 01:04:03,048
She called me.

891
01:04:04,591 --> 01:04:06,677
I have collected the evidence.

892
01:04:07,261 --> 01:04:09,930
Is this marriage fraud?

893
01:04:10,013 --> 01:04:11,306
Or ruin the marriage?

894
01:04:11,807 --> 01:04:15,894
It's all right. Just remember to prepare a generous compensation.

895
01:04:16,562 --> 01:04:20,232
I don't need you to worry.

896
01:04:20,315 --> 01:04:23,402
Actually, I wanted to let you have some free time.

897
01:04:23,485 --> 01:04:28,365
But I found one
There are many men who are much better than you.

898
01:04:29,283 --> 01:04:30,367
So bye.

899
01:04:41,044 --> 01:04:42,671
sorry

900
01:07:27,127 --> 01:07:30,130
