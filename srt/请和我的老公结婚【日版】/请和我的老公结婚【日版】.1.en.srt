00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:46,130
I'll give this to you.

3
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:10,696
Wow, it's so scary!

4
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:12,364
-Right?
-It's so high!

5
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:16,410
So high! We're so high up!
What? Aren't we at the very top?

6
00:01:16,494 --> 00:01:17,328
Right?

7
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:19,413
It's the top. Can you take a picture?

8
00:01:19,497 --> 00:01:20,539
Sure.

9
00:01:20,623 --> 00:01:22,124
-Say cheese!
-Say cheese!

10
00:01:23,751 --> 00:01:25,586
Wow! How is it? I hope I'm not cut out?

11
00:01:25,669 --> 00:01:26,629
Please.

12
00:01:26,712 --> 00:01:27,588
I don't know anything.

13
00:01:28,339 --> 00:01:31,342
-Looks good, looks good. Doesn't it?
-Amazing.

14
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:32,802
-You're super sparkly.
-Really?

15
00:01:32,885 --> 00:01:33,803
So cute.

16
00:01:33,886 --> 00:01:35,554
-It suits you.
-I'm nervous.

17
00:01:35,638 --> 00:01:36,597
Ah, scary!

18
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,183
-That's way too much!
-That's not true. It suits you.

19
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:40,100
You look cute.

20
00:01:41,185 --> 00:01:43,270
-It's super good. Yeah, yeah. Cute!
-Really?

21
00:01:46,899 --> 00:01:48,984
Excuse me, everyone, over here please.

22
00:01:49,068 --> 00:01:52,530
This here is from a while back,
it's Suzuto.

23
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:53,614
Does anyone know it?

24
00:01:54,198 --> 00:01:56,408
-Everyone knows it, right?
-Obviously, right?

25
00:01:57,535 --> 00:02:01,205
Okay, and over here is the newest Suzuto.

26
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:03,123
Now, can you look over here for a bit?

27
00:02:03,207 --> 00:02:04,875
Thank you for waiting!

28
00:02:05,793 --> 00:02:06,710
This is so good!

29
00:02:07,211 --> 00:02:08,045
I'm glad.

30
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:09,505
It's seriously good.

31
00:02:11,757 --> 00:02:13,384
-Yeah.
-Another helping!

32
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:14,760
-Huh, another?
-Yeah.

33
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:37,616
Yay! Thank you, Misa!

34
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:42,079
<i>I had a lot of happy moments.</i>

35
00:02:43,205 --> 00:02:46,417
<i>Yeah, I didn't have that bad of a life.</i>

00:02:49,628 --> 00:02:50,546
Mrs. Hirano.

37
00:02:51,589 --> 00:02:52,590
Mrs. Hirano?

38
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:57,177
Do you still not have an appetite today?

39
00:02:58,804 --> 00:02:59,930
Sorry.

How are you feeling?

44
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:52,691
So-so.

45
00:03:52,775 --> 00:03:54,860
I thought you'd be able to eat jelly.

00:03:56,904 --> 00:03:57,905

00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:01,992
Are you okay?

49
00:04:03,994 --> 00:04:06,914
I'll bring you anything you want to eat.

50
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:11,043
Piping hot ramen and gyoza.

51
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:14,004
Just kidding.

52
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:16,090
Jeez.

53
00:04:16,966 --> 00:04:18,926
What did you do today?

54
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:21,929
Well...

55
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:27,726
A <i>misanga?</i>

56
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:31,605
The granny I share a room with
gave me some embroidery thread.

57
00:04:31,689 --> 00:04:34,108
Wow, so nostalgic!

58
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:39,446
Hey, do you remember?

59
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:43,117
The heart <i>misanga </i>that you gave me.

60
00:04:45,244 --> 00:04:47,246
There's no way I could forget.

61
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:52,334
After all, it's thanks to this
that I became friends with you, Misa.

62
00:04:55,713 --> 00:04:58,132
Wait up. I'm almost done with it.

63
00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:08,308
Has Tomoya...

64
00:05:10,019 --> 00:05:11,603
come by to see you recently?

65
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:18,485
I see.

66
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:23,824
But, well,
he did just launch his business,

67
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:26,410
so he's probably busy, right?

68
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:28,954
I'm sure he's doing his best
to not worry you, Misa.

69
00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:32,833
How about you, Reina? Is work going well?

70
00:05:33,584 --> 00:05:35,377
Just awful!

71
00:05:35,461 --> 00:05:37,880
Everyone above
and below me are so selfish.

72
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:41,675
Seriously, without you,
our company's a mess.

73
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:46,305
Finished!

74
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:49,433
-Give me your hand.
-Okay.

75
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:59,276
I've finally returned the favor.

76
00:06:07,201 --> 00:06:08,535
They say...

77
00:06:10,329 --> 00:06:13,707
if a <i>misanga </i>breaks naturally,
your wish comes true, right?

78
00:06:15,084 --> 00:06:16,043
Yeah.

79
00:06:19,505 --> 00:06:21,256
I hope it comes true soon...

80
00:06:28,347 --> 00:06:32,309
I wish for you to get better, Misa.

81
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:51,078
Well then, I'll come again soon.

82
00:07:04,258 --> 00:07:07,761
<i>Grandma, it's Misa. Are you well?</i>

83
00:07:07,845 --> 00:07:08,679
MISA

84
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:11,390
Kikue, your granddaughter
is asking how you're doing.

85
00:07:12,391 --> 00:07:16,228
Grandma, the weather is nice here.

86
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:20,190
I'll call again.

87
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:30,325
You said you were from Toyama, right?

88
00:07:31,493 --> 00:07:32,786
Are your parents still there?

89
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:38,709
My dad passed away
when I was a college student.

90
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:43,172
As for my mom, she left when I was little.

91
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:47,092
They say she died
from the same illness as me.

92
00:07:47,718 --> 00:07:48,635
I see.

93
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:53,849
Actually, something good
is happening today.

94
00:08:00,898 --> 00:08:01,815
Wow!

95
00:08:02,733 --> 00:08:04,693
I'm going to see someone important to me.

96
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:07,279

101
00:08:58,372 --> 00:08:59,581
Yes, hello?

102
00:08:59,665 --> 00:09:01,833
<i>I'm Miyata</i>
<i>from Tokyo Future Life Insurance.</i>

103
00:09:01,917 --> 00:09:04,211
<i>I'm calling regarding your inquiry.</i>

104
00:09:05,212 --> 00:09:06,046
Yes.

105
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:10,926
My grandmother is the beneficiary
of my life insurance,

106
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:13,053
but since she has dementia
and can't make claims,

107
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:14,596
I'd like to appoint a representative.

108
00:09:15,097 --> 00:09:17,808
<i>But the beneficiary was changed</i>
<i>three months ago.</i>

109
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:21,979
<i>From your grandmother</i>
<i>to your husband, Tomoya Hirano.</i>

110
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:24,147
What?

111
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:49,423
{\an8}NO TAXIS FOUND

112
00:10:29,046 --> 00:10:30,255
Please get in.

113
00:10:47,898 --> 00:10:48,899
Are you okay?

114
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:52,110
I'm okay.

115
00:10:54,946 --> 00:10:56,823
Well, I'm glad I picked you up.

116
00:10:57,949 --> 00:10:59,451
It was fate.

117
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:02,454
Are you in a hurry?

118
00:11:02,954 --> 00:11:03,789
Yes.

119
00:11:04,373 --> 00:11:06,875
I know the best route,
so please leave it to me.

120
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:08,919
Thank you so much...

121
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:10,879
Nah, no problem at all!

122
00:11:13,715 --> 00:11:16,843
Do you happen to be from Toyama?

123
00:11:17,511 --> 00:11:18,595
Wow, you got it!

124
00:11:19,096 --> 00:11:20,430
Is my accent that obvious?

125
00:11:20,514 --> 00:11:22,015
No, not at all!

126
00:11:22,099 --> 00:11:24,184
I'm also from Toyama.

127
00:11:24,267 --> 00:11:26,937
Wow, what a coincidence.

128
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:31,983
My dad was also a taxi driver.

129
00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:36,029
How you talk is similar to him,
so it's somewhat nostalgic.

130
00:11:36,113 --> 00:11:37,864
Is that so?

131
00:11:39,408 --> 00:11:44,037
You've come quite a long way from Toyama.

132
00:11:44,121 --> 00:11:45,455
That's true.

133
00:11:47,124 --> 00:11:49,209
Miss, take a look outside.

134
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:51,503
The view's beautiful.

135
00:11:59,553 --> 00:12:02,055
But it's still too early
for autumn leaves.

136
00:12:03,974 --> 00:12:06,560
I told you
I know the best route, didn't I?

137
00:12:07,144 --> 00:12:09,980
Now, hold on tight.

138
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:40,510
You can go anywhere...
wherever your heart desires.

139
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:45,432
You'll meet them soon enough.

140
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:49,686
Someone who truly cherishes you.

141
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:36,149
Miss!

142
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:39,152
Miss!

143
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:40,904
We've arrived.

144
00:13:41,363 --> 00:13:43,406
Sorry, looks like I dozed off...

145
00:13:44,616 --> 00:13:46,159
Can I pay by card, please?

146
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:48,495
That won't be necessary.

147
00:13:50,121 --> 00:13:53,124
Truth is, you're my last passenger.

148
00:13:53,959 --> 00:13:56,962
Today's my last day as a driver.

149
00:13:57,671 --> 00:13:58,505
But...

150
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:00,382
Here, hold out your hands.

151
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:04,719
Three o'clock snacks.

152
00:14:11,142 --> 00:14:12,018
Have a good day.

153
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,897
Thank you.

154
00:14:57,606 --> 00:14:59,608
HIRANO

155
00:15:07,365 --> 00:15:08,199
I'm home.

156
00:15:13,204 --> 00:15:14,748
Move? To where?

157
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:19,002
To wherever you want to live, Reina.

158
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:23,882
My apartment's contract is up soon...

159
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:26,426
What did the doctor say again?

160
00:15:28,011 --> 00:15:31,890
When I asked,
they said three months at the earliest.

161
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:35,602
Six months at most.

162
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:39,022
Twelve months if a miracle happens.

163
00:15:40,357 --> 00:15:42,275
What kind of multiplication is that?

164
00:15:42,359 --> 00:15:44,027
Too vague, right?

165
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:49,240
Well, we'll have the money
by the new year at the latest.

166
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:52,077
Everything's going to be fine.

167
00:15:53,328 --> 00:15:54,704
I wonder if that's true?

168
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:57,290
There you go again.

169
00:15:57,707 --> 00:15:59,292
Have a little faith in me.

170
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,846
What are you talking about?

171
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:16,851
You said you'll have the money
by the new year.

172
00:16:17,435 --> 00:16:18,770
What money?

173
00:16:21,356 --> 00:16:22,273
I'm sorry, Misa.

174
00:16:24,401 --> 00:16:28,780
Both Tomoya and I
were so scared of losing you,

175
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:33,159
and our loneliness just drove us
closer and closer together.

176
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:44,003
Reina and I
were overwhelmed by your illness, Misa.

177
00:16:44,087 --> 00:16:47,507
It just happened.
We weren't in a normal state of mind.

178
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:52,887
When did it start?

179
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,727
-About half a year...
-One month...

180
00:17:04,107 --> 00:17:08,069
You couldn't at least hold out
until I was gone?

181
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,114
I'm still alive.

182
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,035
The money coming by the new year...

183
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:20,707
is from my life insurance, isn't it?

184
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:24,127
I heard it from someone
at the insurance company.

185
00:17:24,753 --> 00:17:27,547
The money was supposed
to go to my grandmother,

186
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:29,716
but they said you became the beneficiary.

187
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:31,509
What did you tell the insurance company?

188
00:17:32,886 --> 00:17:34,554
You didn't say anything, did you?

189
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:37,515
Did I say anything?

190
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:39,434
My mom handled everything perfectly!

191
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:41,352
Don't ruin this for us!

192
00:17:41,436 --> 00:17:43,730
She could get fired
from the insurance company!

193
00:17:46,107 --> 00:17:48,651
Your mom helped you?

194
00:17:49,527 --> 00:17:52,906
If Grandma doesn't get my money,
she won't be able to live in the--

195
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:55,450
She's just
your deadbeat mom's mother, right?

196
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:59,996
Why would you leave money
to that useless old hag?

197
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,164
I'm all she has...

198
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:02,123
What about me?

199
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:07,045
You know I'm having money problems,
yet you're so quick to abandon me?

200
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:11,549
Can't you think of the feelings
of the person left behind at the end?

201
00:18:14,385 --> 00:18:16,638
What do you think I married you for?

202
00:18:17,931 --> 00:18:20,350
The reason I married
a boring, dull girl like you

203
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:22,894
is because you're a stingy woman
who saves money.

204
00:18:22,977 --> 00:18:25,146
I married you when no one wanted you,

205
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:27,524
and at the very end,
this is how you repay me?

206
00:18:28,191 --> 00:18:32,320
It's because of marrying you
that my life went to hell.

207
00:18:32,403 --> 00:18:35,114
My life's a failure because of you!

208
00:18:41,329 --> 00:18:43,540
This is the worst.

209
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:48,253
You both are truly the worst.

210
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:50,547
I never want to see you again.

211
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:53,508
You're going to end our relationship
with words like that?

212
00:18:53,591 --> 00:18:54,843
Of course I am!

213
00:18:55,885 --> 00:19:00,223
How can you
trample on people's feelings like this?

214
00:19:06,062 --> 00:19:08,022
You're still you, right to the end.

215
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:10,316
What?

216
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,194
Still the good girl.
Still playing the victim.

217
00:19:14,863 --> 00:19:19,868
Misa, weren't you always talking about how
Tomoya wouldn't visit you in the hospital

218
00:19:19,951 --> 00:19:21,452
or pay your medical bills?

219
00:19:21,536 --> 00:19:24,539
You complained so much,
I figured you didn't want him anymore.

220
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:32,171
I'm the only one who stuck by your side
when you couldn't make any friends, right?

221
00:19:32,589 --> 00:19:35,091
I came to see you,
stayed with you during the tests,

222
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:36,259
and listened to your fears.

223
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:38,052
After all I've done for you,

224
00:19:38,136 --> 00:19:40,513
are you going to make me
the villain over a single mistake?

225
00:19:40,597 --> 00:19:44,684
Is this what friends do?

226
00:19:55,528 --> 00:20:00,116
Tomoya and I have our reasons.

227
00:20:00,909 --> 00:20:02,327
You don't even know, do you?

228
00:20:03,578 --> 00:20:06,414
Why I've always hated you...

229
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,878
I'll tell you since it's the end anyway.

230
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:18,051
You've been an eyesore since we were kids.

231
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:20,845
We were never friends.

232
00:20:29,312 --> 00:20:31,272
That's enough.

233
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:43,159
I'm going to tell
the insurance company the truth.

234
00:20:56,631 --> 00:20:58,424
-Hand it over!
-Stop!

235
00:20:58,508 --> 00:21:00,259
-No!
-I said hand it over!

236
00:21:00,343 --> 00:21:01,970
-What the hell!
-Let go of me!

237
00:21:06,057 --> 00:21:09,602
<i>Thank you for becoming my family.</i>

238
00:21:11,229 --> 00:21:14,190
<i>If there comes a time</i>
<i>when you fall in love,</i>

239
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:17,735
<i>don't worry about me, and get remarried.</i>

240
00:21:17,819 --> 00:21:20,530
Stop it, damn it!

241
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:27,662
Shit...

242
00:21:34,043 --> 00:21:39,924
<i>Reina, from the time we were little,</i>
<i>you were always right there by my side.</i>

243
00:21:42,051 --> 00:21:46,180
<i>Thank you so much for becoming my friend.</i>

244
00:21:47,432 --> 00:21:52,020
<i>I wasn't alone because I had you.</i>

245
00:21:56,357 --> 00:21:58,901
Bye-bye, Misa.

246
00:22:50,912 --> 00:22:53,831
My friend... my friend jumped down!

247
00:22:59,587 --> 00:23:02,548
<i>I had a lot of happy moments.</i>

248
00:23:03,341 --> 00:23:05,426
<i>I didn't have that bad of a life.</i>

249
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:07,428
<i>That's a lie.</i>

250
00:23:07,512 --> 00:23:08,930
Hey, Tomoya.

251
00:23:09,013 --> 00:23:10,765
Your money is my money right, Misa?

252
00:23:11,307 --> 00:23:12,767
Since we're married now.

253
00:23:17,814 --> 00:23:20,525
-Here, here, use it as you like.
-Thank you.

254
00:23:20,608 --> 00:23:21,943
-All right.
-Be careful.

255
00:23:22,026 --> 00:23:23,778
-Okay, okay.
-Thank you so much.

256
00:23:23,861 --> 00:23:25,780
<i>Life's just one bad thing after another.</i>

257
00:23:25,863 --> 00:23:27,240
-Yeah.
-Thanks for the help.

258
00:23:27,323 --> 00:23:30,660
<i>I've never felt happy in my life,</i>

259
00:23:30,743 --> 00:23:34,247
<i>but I never imagined</i>
<i>it would end this badly.</i>

260
00:23:43,089 --> 00:23:46,926
One... more... time...

261
00:24:01,274 --> 00:24:02,108
<i>Ms. Kanbe!</i>

262
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:04,277
<i>Ms. Kanbe!</i>

263
00:24:05,987 --> 00:24:06,821
Ms. Kanbe!

264
00:24:20,877 --> 00:24:23,754
Ms. Kanbe? Are you okay?

265
00:24:23,838 --> 00:24:25,047
Yes!

266
00:24:26,507 --> 00:24:27,800
Ms. Sumiyoshi?

267
00:24:38,936 --> 00:24:40,021
The office?

268
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:43,232
Why?

269
00:24:46,694 --> 00:24:49,780
You must've been up all night
preparing for the presentation.

270
00:24:49,864 --> 00:24:50,948
Thanks for your hard work.

271
00:24:51,032 --> 00:24:52,033
Presentation?

272
00:24:56,829 --> 00:24:59,081
Sorry for always burdening you, Ms. Kanbe.

273
00:24:59,165 --> 00:25:01,542
Could we just go over it
at the cafe downstairs?

274
00:25:03,085 --> 00:25:03,920
Sure.

275
00:25:18,309 --> 00:25:20,394
<i>Sure enough, it's the office.</i>

276
00:25:20,478 --> 00:25:21,771
<i>Why am I here?</i>

277
00:25:33,574 --> 00:25:34,700
Misa.

278
00:25:45,002 --> 00:25:46,545
Excuse me, excuse me.

279
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:48,631
Excuse me.

280
00:26:19,078 --> 00:26:20,705
That's a nice scarf.

281
00:26:31,424 --> 00:26:33,342
Excuse me.

282
00:26:37,805 --> 00:26:38,639
Sorr--

283
00:26:39,557 --> 00:26:40,433
Misa!

284
00:26:40,933 --> 00:26:43,060
What's wrong? Why are you in such a hurry?

285
00:26:43,144 --> 00:26:45,521
Oh, did you hear that
the location of the presentation changed?

286
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:46,939
I sent you an email!

287
00:26:49,191 --> 00:26:50,276
Are you okay?

288
00:26:50,943 --> 00:26:52,862
You look pale.

289
00:26:52,945 --> 00:26:55,156
I told you staying up all night
wasn't good for you...

290
00:26:57,366 --> 00:26:58,200
Are you okay?

291
00:27:05,875 --> 00:27:06,709
Misa?

292
00:27:07,418 --> 00:27:08,544
Ms. Kanbe?

293
00:27:14,133 --> 00:27:15,760
<i>Why? Why?</i>

294
00:27:15,843 --> 00:27:18,304
<i>I just fell from the apartment,</i>
<i>how did I get to the office?</i>

295
00:27:18,387 --> 00:27:21,640

What's going on?
I can't believe this.

I'm... young!

I look so young!

312
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:30,394
Whoa, so young! I really am!

313
00:29:34,023 --> 00:29:36,150
<i>My body has also gone back ten years?</i>

314

<i>That means...</i>

It...

316
00:29:46,285 --> 00:29:47,161
doesn't hurt.

Yeah, something like that.

Oh, I'm the one

358
00:34:27,357 --> 00:34:28,400
Okay...

359
00:34:33,572 --> 00:34:34,406
Yes?

360
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:36,492
Misa, I'm so sorry!

361
00:34:36,575 --> 00:34:38,494
I sent the wrong address
for the presentation!

362
00:34:38,577 --> 00:34:40,120
I'll send you the right one now!

363
00:35:15,656 --> 00:35:16,740
<i>It's the same.</i>

364
00:35:23,205 --> 00:35:25,123
<i>My heels break, so I fall and...</i>

365
00:35:33,423 --> 00:35:35,801
I'm Kanbe from Suzutoya Holdings'
second planning division.

366
00:35:36,802 --> 00:35:37,970
Thank you.

367
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:47,020
No way, no way...
Excuse me, it's not responding...

368
00:35:47,104 --> 00:35:48,856
<i>The entry pass doesn't work, and...</i>

369
00:35:48,939 --> 00:35:51,233
Oh, come on... Excuse me, thank you.

370
00:35:54,987 --> 00:35:57,531
<i>The elevator is broken</i>
<i>so it doesn't come, and...</i>

371
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:00,784
<i>The room was on the 27th floor, and...</i>

372
00:36:03,495 --> 00:36:05,038
I'm sorry for being late!

373
00:36:07,124 --> 00:36:10,085
I'm Kanbe from Suzutoya Holdings'
second planning division.

374
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:13,714
Thank you for considering us at this time.

375
00:36:17,134 --> 00:36:20,178
<i>I was so flustered and nervous,</i>
<i>I gave a disastrous presentation.</i>

376
00:36:20,846 --> 00:36:21,680
This isn't good.

377
00:36:36,403 --> 00:36:38,822
I'm Kanbe from Suzutoya Holdings'
second planning division.

378
00:36:43,952 --> 00:36:45,329
Sorry, sorry!

379
00:37:00,802 --> 00:37:02,012
My apologies.

380
00:37:07,309 --> 00:37:10,270
That scarf doesn't suit you.

381
00:37:13,023 --> 00:37:15,275
You're here from Suzutoya Holdings, right?

382
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:16,193
Yes.

383
00:37:16,777 --> 00:37:19,112
My name is Kanbe
from the second planning division.

384
00:37:19,196 --> 00:37:20,614
Are you with Ishii?

385
00:37:20,697 --> 00:37:25,452
No, I'm Suzuki, from Suzutoya's
corporate strategy division.

386
00:37:27,829 --> 00:37:28,872
Director?

387
00:37:29,915 --> 00:37:30,999
My apologies!

388
00:37:44,554 --> 00:37:45,389
Go ahead.

389
00:37:46,181 --> 00:37:47,391
Excuse me!

390
00:38:02,406 --> 00:38:06,994
Now then, it's time to start,
so please allow us to begin.

391
00:38:07,077 --> 00:38:10,497
Kanbe from our company
will be presenting today.

392
00:38:11,498 --> 00:38:16,962
What we propose is
a new melting sensation of milk and fruit.

393
00:38:17,045 --> 00:38:20,257
These are fruit au lait drinks
using seasonal fruits

394
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:23,385
from farms in various regions
across the country.

395
00:38:24,386 --> 00:38:26,179
Peach au lait from Yamanashi,

396
00:38:26,263 --> 00:38:29,808
mango au lait from Miyazaki,
strawberry au lait from Tochigi...

397
00:38:29,891 --> 00:38:32,936
<i>Hang on, this fruit au lait plan...</i>

398
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:33,854
Okay.

399
00:38:38,483 --> 00:38:40,110
That was a rejection phone call.

400
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:46,033
I said all along that this plan was weak.

401
00:38:46,116 --> 00:38:47,492
I'm very sorry.

402
00:38:47,576 --> 00:38:51,663
Hey, Inoue,
you're using way too much tissue!

403
00:38:52,247 --> 00:38:54,124
<i>The client declined,</i>

404
00:38:54,207 --> 00:38:56,626
<i>and joint development went</i>
<i>to a rival company.</i>

405
00:38:56,710 --> 00:39:00,047
<i>The fruit au lait drinks</i>
<i>were sold as our original brand,</i>

406
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:03,091
<i>but they never gained traction,</i>
<i>so production quickly ended.</i>

407
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:06,636
Pear au lait from Yamagata,

408
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:10,640
orange au lait from Wakayama,
and more fruit au lait drinks...

409
00:39:12,642 --> 00:39:14,478
is not what this is.

410
00:39:14,561 --> 00:39:15,395
It's tapioca.

411
00:39:21,693 --> 00:39:22,527
Tapioca?

412
00:39:22,611 --> 00:39:25,238
Please forget about
those documents for a moment.

413
00:39:26,114 --> 00:39:28,700
It's tapioca. Tapioca is what's happening!

414
00:39:28,784 --> 00:39:33,371
But isn't tapioca that trendy drink
from Taiwan from a while ago?

415
00:39:33,455 --> 00:39:35,123
Nobody's going to buy that now.

416
00:39:35,207 --> 00:39:38,293
No, it's going to blow up
in the very near future.

417
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:41,463
It's true. They'll make up words
like "tapi time" and "tapi life,"

418
00:39:41,546 --> 00:39:44,716
and even open Tokyo Tapioca Land
in Harajuku...

419
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,843
Tokyo Tapioca Land?

420
00:39:46,927 --> 00:39:48,386
It's true!

421
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:51,431
If we sell it now,
we'll be at the forefront of the trend.

422
00:39:51,515 --> 00:39:53,308
Please trust me on this!

423
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:54,559
Sales of tapioca drinks

424
00:39:54,643 --> 00:39:57,270
are expected to continue
to grow steadily until COVID hits.

425
00:39:57,354 --> 00:39:58,188
"COVID"?

426
00:40:00,607 --> 00:40:02,275
What's this COVID?

427
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,412
Thank you for your time. Bye.

428
00:40:19,042 --> 00:40:20,961
That was the quickest rejection call.

429
00:40:22,003 --> 00:40:23,004
I'm very sorry.

430
00:40:24,047 --> 00:40:26,633
Is a presentation
the place to air your delusions?

431
00:40:26,716 --> 00:40:29,261
"Tapi time"? "Tapi life"?
What were you thinking?

432
00:40:29,344 --> 00:40:31,680
And what the hell is Tokyo Tapioca Land?

433
00:40:31,763 --> 00:40:34,182
If something like that
ever existed in this world,

434
00:40:34,266 --> 00:40:36,351
I'd dance the Yosakoi in the nude!

435
00:40:38,061 --> 00:40:40,522
If you'd just done
the fruit au lait presentation properly,

436
00:40:40,605 --> 00:40:41,731
it would've gone through.

437
00:40:43,066 --> 00:40:44,693
I'm very sorry.

438
00:40:44,776 --> 00:40:46,945
Your recklessness just caused a huge loss!

439
00:40:49,656 --> 00:40:52,826
Ms. Kanbe
has been constantly overworked lately,

440
00:40:52,909 --> 00:40:54,578
and she hasn't been getting enough sleep.

441
00:40:54,661 --> 00:40:55,954
I'm not sleeping either!

442
00:40:56,037 --> 00:40:57,747
Yesterday, I got about five hours.

443
00:40:58,331 --> 00:41:00,750
You've gotten good
at nothing but making excuses.

444
00:41:02,043 --> 00:41:07,841
Hey, Yasuda, you have to use the backside
of the copy paper too, come on.

445
00:41:07,924 --> 00:41:11,845
Ms. Sumiyoshi,
I apologize for acting on my own.

446
00:41:13,597 --> 00:41:14,931
It's because you're tired.

447
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:30,697
I'm sorry, Misa.

448
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:33,992
I made a mistake
with copy and pasting the venue location.

449
00:41:34,951 --> 00:41:37,871
You panicking at the presentation
was my fault, wasn't it?

450
00:41:37,954 --> 00:41:38,997
I'm really sorry.

451
00:41:41,041 --> 00:41:42,542
I'm sorry, Misa.

452
00:41:43,084 --> 00:41:46,004
I made a mistake
with copy and pasting the venue location.

453
00:41:46,838 --> 00:41:49,799
You panicking at the presentation
was my fault, wasn't it?

454
00:41:49,883 --> 00:41:50,842
I'm really sorry.

455
00:41:50,926 --> 00:41:52,928
No, Reina, you didn't do anything wrong.

456
00:41:53,929 --> 00:41:57,474
It's my fault the presentation
was a disaster.

457
00:42:11,238 --> 00:42:13,740
Hey, let's go eat something delicious.
With Tomoya too!

458
00:42:13,823 --> 00:42:16,284
I have plans today, so...

459
00:42:27,879 --> 00:42:29,756
<i>How long is this going to continue?</i>

460
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:32,592
<i>Isn't this a bit long</i>
<i>for my life to flash before my eyes?</i>

461
00:42:32,676 --> 00:42:35,136
<i>On September 18th, 2025, I...</i>

462
00:42:35,845 --> 00:42:41,184
-Today is our grand opening!
-Today is our grand opening!

463
00:42:41,518 --> 00:42:43,561
<i>I was killed by Reina and Tomoya.</i>

464
00:42:44,312 --> 00:42:47,274
<i>Then I returned to September 18th, 2015,</i>

465
00:42:47,357 --> 00:42:50,568
<i>ten years ago,</i>
<i>with my memories still intact.</i>

466
00:42:53,113 --> 00:42:54,322
{\an8}PACHINKO＆SLOTS
SEPTEMBER 18, 2015

467
00:42:54,406 --> 00:42:55,657
{\an8}<i>2015?</i>

468
00:43:14,968 --> 00:43:18,638
<i>That shop was tucked away</i>
<i>in a back alley in Jimbocho.</i>

469
00:43:20,682 --> 00:43:24,769
{\an8}JANUARY 2016

470
00:43:25,645 --> 00:43:27,814
OUR STORE CLOSED
AT THE END OF DECEMBER 2015

471
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:36,448
{\an8}MAMEKAME-DOU

472
00:43:36,531 --> 00:43:37,824
{\an8}A secret hideout.

473
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:41,411
{\an8}A place I thought
I'd never be able to come back to.

474
00:43:41,494 --> 00:43:42,495
Misa!

475
00:43:43,455 --> 00:43:44,914
Dad!

476
00:43:44,998 --> 00:43:47,459
Did you get lost?
I should've picked you up.

477
00:43:47,542 --> 00:43:48,793
What? It's fine.

478
00:43:48,877 --> 00:43:50,712
-I just took a little detour.
-I see.

479
00:43:50,795 --> 00:43:52,672
I was guided by a kind student.

480
00:43:54,132 --> 00:43:55,675
Why are we meeting here?

481
00:43:55,759 --> 00:43:57,802
{\an8}The couple running this place...

482
00:43:57,886 --> 00:43:58,762
{\an8}JULY 2006

483
00:43:58,845 --> 00:44:00,638
{\an8}...took my taxi during a trip to Toyama.

484
00:44:00,722 --> 00:44:01,681
Wow!

485
00:44:01,765 --> 00:44:03,558
When they heard I had a daughter in Tokyo,

486
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:06,269
they said, "Stop by
next time you're visiting her."

487
00:44:06,353 --> 00:44:07,979
-Let's go, let's go. Yeah.
-Okay!

488
00:44:08,313 --> 00:44:09,814
I wonder if the owner is here.

489
00:44:16,905 --> 00:44:18,198
Wow, so cute!

490
00:44:18,281 --> 00:44:20,200
It is cute, isn't it?

491
00:44:20,283 --> 00:44:22,619
It's a beautiful little sweets shop.

492
00:44:23,078 --> 00:44:24,704
-Wow.
-Welcome!

493
00:44:25,121 --> 00:44:26,831
-Hello, hello.
-Oh!

494
00:44:27,457 --> 00:44:28,541
Honey!

495
00:44:28,625 --> 00:44:30,585
-It's our driver from Toyama!
-They remembered me.

496
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:31,836
The one from Toyama?

497
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:34,089
-Look at that!
-It's been a while.

498
00:44:34,172 --> 00:44:36,049
-Thank you for that time.
-Thank you for your help.

499
00:44:36,132 --> 00:44:38,510
No, no, I actually came!

500
00:44:38,593 --> 00:44:41,054
This is our famous Mamekame set.

501
00:44:41,137 --> 00:44:42,055
Thank you.

502
00:44:42,138 --> 00:44:43,515
-Take your time!
-Thank you.

503
00:44:44,349 --> 00:44:45,517
-Dad.
-Yeah?

504
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:47,394
Why did you come to Tokyo all of a sudden?

505
00:44:49,270 --> 00:44:52,399
I just wanted to enjoy
a three o'clock snack with you for once.

506
00:44:56,528 --> 00:44:58,113
-You doing okay?
-Yeah.

507
00:44:58,238 --> 00:44:59,447
Yeah? I'm glad.

508
00:44:59,823 --> 00:45:00,657
That's right.

509
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:02,617
There's a pond at the university
that has a turtle.

510
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:05,620
-Yeah?
-But since it's hot this year,

511
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:08,248
the pond looks like it might dry up,
so I'm worried.

512
00:45:08,331 --> 00:45:09,999
You're kind, Misa.

513
00:45:10,083 --> 00:45:12,168
That's not true.

514
00:45:14,587 --> 00:45:16,339
It's hard to be a kind person.

515
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:19,467
If that's the case,
then I guess I got it from you, Dad.

516
00:45:21,177 --> 00:45:24,514
You should worry less about the turtle
and more about yourself.

517
00:45:24,597 --> 00:45:26,141
-Look.
-Come on!

518
00:45:26,224 --> 00:45:28,435
You're always so quick to fold origami.

519
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:30,145
Wow!

520
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:36,192
No matter where you are,
if you're ever in trouble,

521
00:45:36,276 --> 00:45:39,529
I'll come flying in with my taxi, okay?

522
00:45:39,612 --> 00:45:41,865
In your taxi?

523
00:45:42,615 --> 00:45:47,203
<i>At that time, I think my father knew</i>
<i>how much time he had left to live.</i>

524
00:46:05,388 --> 00:46:07,140
Three o'clock snacks.

525
00:46:28,953 --> 00:46:32,165
<i>You can go anywhere...</i>
<i>wherever your heart desires.</i>

526
00:46:33,249 --> 00:46:34,918
<i>You'll meet them soon enough.</i>

527
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:38,713
<i>Someone who truly cherishes you.</i>

528
00:46:40,632 --> 00:46:41,591
Have a good day.

529
00:46:43,593 --> 00:46:45,011
<i>Thank you.</i>

530
00:46:49,641 --> 00:46:50,850
Dad...

531
00:47:24,092 --> 00:47:26,386
<i>Hello, Grandma?</i>

532
00:47:27,262 --> 00:47:30,306
Were you just eating dinner?
What did you eat?

533
00:47:30,807 --> 00:47:33,142
<i>Grilled scallops with butter.</i>

534
00:47:33,768 --> 00:47:35,520
Really? That's nice.

535
00:47:37,313 --> 00:47:39,899
Are you Misa?

536
00:47:42,443 --> 00:47:45,238
That's right. It's Misa.

537
00:47:46,197 --> 00:47:49,993
Make sure you get enough to eat.

538
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:53,621
Yeah, I'll eat a lot.

539
00:47:54,998 --> 00:47:56,666
Well, I'll call again soon, okay?

540
00:47:57,458 --> 00:47:59,043
Good night, Grandma.

541
00:48:15,435 --> 00:48:16,686
Dad...

542
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:21,816
Did you bring me here, Dad?

543
00:48:38,249 --> 00:48:39,792
I'm ten years younger.

544
00:48:41,836 --> 00:48:45,131
My body is healthy,
and I even feel hungry.

545
00:48:48,801 --> 00:48:53,139
Now that I've gone back ten years,
can I do things differently?

546
00:48:59,646 --> 00:49:02,607
That scarf doesn't suit you.

547
00:49:07,528 --> 00:49:09,697
{\an8}HAPPY BIRTHDAY
I FOUND A SCARF THAT SUITS YOU! - REINA

548
00:49:26,422 --> 00:49:28,216
{\an8}REINA

549
00:49:43,564 --> 00:49:44,482
Hello?

550
00:49:55,451 --> 00:49:58,538
{\an8}SUZUTOYA HOLDINGS CO. LTD.
SECOND PLANNING DIVISION MISA KANBE

551
00:49:59,372 --> 00:50:03,376
Tapi... oca?

552
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:09,632
If Japan wins today's match,

553
00:50:09,716 --> 00:50:11,968
it'll be our first win
in the World Cup in 24 years.

554
00:50:12,051 --> 00:50:13,761
-Seriously?
-Wouldn't that be awesome?

555
00:50:13,845 --> 00:50:14,846
We gotta watch it!

556
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:23,229
POOL B JAPAN VS SOUTH AFRICA
0:45 KICK OFF

557
00:50:26,524 --> 00:50:27,358
Misa!

558
00:50:30,153 --> 00:50:32,447
You left early yesterday.

559
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:34,449
I had so much I wanted to talk about.

560
00:50:36,451 --> 00:50:37,493
Yeah.

561
00:50:38,244 --> 00:50:40,079
I want to talk to you too, Reina.

562
00:50:40,830 --> 00:50:41,748
He's here!

563
00:50:42,331 --> 00:50:44,167
Seiya, over here!

564
00:50:47,462 --> 00:50:49,380
Leave today's bill to me.

565
00:50:50,715 --> 00:50:52,258
-Did you wait?
-Not long.

566
00:50:53,134 --> 00:50:54,177
Misa.

567
00:50:54,594 --> 00:50:56,304
{\an8}You're late. Over here, over here.

568
00:50:57,930 --> 00:50:58,973
-Let's go.
-Yeah.

569
00:51:02,935 --> 00:51:04,270
Wow, I'm getting excited.

570
00:51:04,353 --> 00:51:06,898
-Can we toast again?
-Sure.

571
00:51:06,981 --> 00:51:08,983
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

572
00:51:09,650 --> 00:51:10,485
Nice.

573
00:51:12,904 --> 00:51:16,908
Oh, right. Reina, are you still
picking Misa's clothes?

574
00:51:17,492 --> 00:51:22,121
Misa has terrible taste in clothes
and makeup because she's cheap.

575
00:51:22,205 --> 00:51:23,206
When we were students,

576
00:51:23,289 --> 00:51:26,083
she'd even sew up the holes
in her socks to keep wearing them!

577
00:51:26,167 --> 00:51:27,084
Crazy.

578
00:51:27,168 --> 00:51:28,836
Come on, Tomoya, say something!

579
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:30,421
<i>It's the same as the first time.</i>

580
00:51:30,505 --> 00:51:33,883
<i>The day of the World Cup, the four of us</i>
<i>were drinking at this sports bar.</i>

581
00:51:33,966 --> 00:51:35,927
{\an8}<i>We have athlete Ayumu Goromaru.</i>

582
00:51:36,010 --> 00:51:38,262
{\an8}Ah, well, that story touched me.

583
00:51:38,763 --> 00:51:41,307
Back in high school,
when Misa was getting bullied,

584
00:51:41,390 --> 00:51:43,226
Reina walked home with her
every day, right?

585
00:51:43,309 --> 00:51:45,394
Hey, did I tell you about that?

586
00:51:45,478 --> 00:51:46,854
Yeah. You did.

587
00:51:47,855 --> 00:51:49,398
Misa, you were bullied?

588
00:51:52,693 --> 00:51:55,530
Misa's the type
that always gets misunderstood,

589
00:51:55,613 --> 00:51:59,033
but I always knew how amazing she was.

590
00:52:01,744 --> 00:52:02,995
-Misa!
-Are you okay?

591
00:52:03,079 --> 00:52:04,705
-I'm really sorry.
-Sorry.

592
00:52:04,789 --> 00:52:06,541
I'll be back right back with a towel.

593
00:52:06,624 --> 00:52:08,376
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

594
00:52:08,459 --> 00:52:09,752
Do you want to go to the restroom?

595
00:52:10,628 --> 00:52:11,629
Let's go.

596
00:52:12,463 --> 00:52:13,840
Jeez, you're soaking wet.

597
00:52:16,259 --> 00:52:19,011
Come on, Misa, you're so careless.

598
00:52:19,512 --> 00:52:21,931
But that waiter should
have been more careful.

599
00:52:22,014 --> 00:52:23,933
You should file a customer complaint.

600
00:52:26,018 --> 00:52:28,396
I'm the one
who bumped into him this time too.

601
00:52:28,479 --> 00:52:29,605
Misa, you were bullied?

602
00:52:29,689 --> 00:52:30,606
Yeah.

603
00:52:31,232 --> 00:52:33,776
Misa's the type
that always gets misunderstood,

604
00:52:33,860 --> 00:52:38,239
but I always knew how amazing she was.

605
00:52:39,866 --> 00:52:41,576
I'm going to the bathroom for a minute.

606
00:52:41,659 --> 00:52:43,077
-Okay.
-Okay. See you soon.

607
00:52:46,622 --> 00:52:47,456
"This time too"?

608
00:52:49,292 --> 00:52:51,502
I meant, it wasn't his fault.

609
00:52:52,003 --> 00:52:55,590
Misa, you're so nice.
You're really a good person.

610
00:52:55,673 --> 00:52:58,092
You never get mad. I love that about you!

611
00:53:00,678 --> 00:53:02,597
<i>You're still you, right to the end.</i>

612
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:05,683
Still the good girl.
Still playing the victim.

613
00:53:15,818 --> 00:53:16,819
So mean.

614
00:53:17,570 --> 00:53:20,740
Seiya said he can't keep up
with the conversation

615
00:53:20,823 --> 00:53:22,867
with Tomoya's university friends.

616
00:53:27,997 --> 00:53:31,042
Misa, you've been dating Tomoya
for half a year, right?

617
00:53:31,792 --> 00:53:33,544
Isn't it about time to have the talk?

618
00:53:34,211 --> 00:53:35,463
Talk about what?

619
00:53:35,838 --> 00:53:36,672
Marriage.

620
00:53:36,756 --> 00:53:40,885
Actually, I've been talking with my man
about it getting serious, too.

621
00:53:41,385 --> 00:53:45,181
Tomoya might not be the most reliable,
to be honest,

622
00:53:45,264 --> 00:53:47,266
but if you stay grounded, you'll be fine.

623
00:53:48,726 --> 00:53:51,020
<i>Reina always looked down on us.</i>

624
00:53:51,103 --> 00:53:53,564
<i>Not just me, but Tomoya too.</i>

625
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:57,485
Wouldn't it be so fun
if we got married at the same time,

626
00:53:57,568 --> 00:54:01,781
had kids right after,
and then raised them together?

627
00:54:01,864 --> 00:54:06,994
Then we'd grow old together,
and if both our husbands died before us,

628
00:54:07,078 --> 00:54:09,789
I'd let you live with me, Misa.

629
00:54:22,635 --> 00:54:24,470
I'll be your friend.

630
00:54:25,638 --> 00:54:26,472
<i>Reina.</i>

631
00:54:27,431 --> 00:54:32,186
<i>Was your wish</i>
<i>to keep me by your side forever,</i>

632
00:54:32,269 --> 00:54:35,189
<i>so I'd always be more miserable than you?</i>

633
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:40,236
<i>Japan forces a turnover!</i>

634
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:41,612
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

635
00:54:42,446 --> 00:54:45,783
Things are getting really good.
That's Goromaru.

636
00:54:46,283 --> 00:54:49,245
Everyone knows him.
He got famous after winning this match.

637
00:54:50,705 --> 00:54:52,123
Winning?

638
00:54:52,206 --> 00:54:56,252
-This is why amateurs are hopeless.
<i>-This could be their chance! But...</i>

639
00:54:56,335 --> 00:54:59,171
South Africa is an absolute powerhouse.

640
00:54:59,255 --> 00:55:01,549
There's no way Japan could win.

641
00:55:01,632 --> 00:55:05,594
It'd be like
Japan beating Brazil in soccer.

642
00:55:07,388 --> 00:55:08,639
What?

643
00:55:09,140 --> 00:55:13,102
<i>Tomoya said something</i>
<i>on September 20th, 2015.</i>

644
00:55:17,106 --> 00:55:20,234
Misa, this is a miracle! A miracle!

645
00:55:20,317 --> 00:55:21,444
It's amazing, right?

646
00:55:21,527 --> 00:55:26,115
I feel like as long as we're together,
Misa, life is going to be good.

647
00:55:27,033 --> 00:55:30,745
<i>He said that at that moment,</i>
<i>he could see a happy future.</i>

648
00:55:46,635 --> 00:55:48,554
That's why you can't get a girlfriend.

649
00:55:48,637 --> 00:55:49,472
Lovey-dovey.

650
00:55:49,555 --> 00:55:50,890
-So cute together.
-Right?

651
00:55:53,142 --> 00:55:54,018
You're bright red.

652
00:55:58,898 --> 00:56:00,024
Seriously?

653
00:56:01,859 --> 00:56:04,570
Misa, this is a miracle! A miracle!

654
00:56:05,321 --> 00:56:09,784
I feel like as long as we're together,
Misa, life is going to be good.

655
00:56:09,867 --> 00:56:11,077
<i>History has been made!</i>

656
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:12,828
<i>The miracle of Brighton.</i>

657
00:56:12,912 --> 00:56:15,081
<i>This is the moment!</i>

658
00:56:15,164 --> 00:56:17,333
Hey... What're you doing?

659
00:56:17,416 --> 00:56:18,584
Tomoya?

660
00:56:20,294 --> 00:56:21,629
Misa!

661
00:56:21,712 --> 00:56:23,089
Misa, where are you going?

662
00:56:25,257 --> 00:56:26,425
Misa.

663
00:56:27,093 --> 00:56:28,969
Come on, where are you going?

664
00:56:29,053 --> 00:56:30,304
Misa!

665
00:56:31,430 --> 00:56:34,266
We have a reservation at a restaurant
on the 23rd, don't forget!

666
00:56:35,101 --> 00:56:36,352
Misa!

667
00:57:04,004 --> 00:57:05,756
PROPOSES

668
00:57:08,217 --> 00:57:10,136
MEET WITH PARENTS

669
00:57:10,219 --> 00:57:12,763
I had your fortune read
by a famous fortune teller.

670
00:57:13,389 --> 00:57:15,808
They said if you don't have a wedding
within the year,

671
00:57:15,891 --> 00:57:18,519
your future children will get sick.

672
00:57:28,988 --> 00:57:32,324
<i>If I know what happens from now,</i>
<i>can I escape my fate?</i>

673
00:57:32,741 --> 00:57:33,576
<i>But...</i>

674
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:35,077
Sorry, sorry!

675
00:57:35,161 --> 00:57:39,081
Thank you for reaching out to us
to develop a collaboration product...

676
00:57:39,165 --> 00:57:40,541
That was the quickest rejection call.

677
00:57:40,624 --> 00:57:42,626
Your recklessness just caused a huge loss!

678
00:57:42,710 --> 00:57:45,921
<i>Even though I avoided being late,</i>
<i>in the end, it was still a failure.</i>

679
00:57:46,005 --> 00:57:47,464
...I always knew how amazing she was.

680
00:57:47,548 --> 00:57:50,384
<i>Just like the first time,</i>
<i>I spilled the beer at the bar.</i>

681
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:53,345
<i>Even if I change my actions,</i>
<i>what happens still happens.</i>

682
00:57:53,429 --> 00:57:54,263
WEDDING

683
00:57:54,346 --> 00:57:56,724
<i>If that's the case,</i>
<i>then even ten years from now...</i>

684
00:57:56,807 --> 00:57:59,810
<i>Why do you think I married you?</i>

685
00:57:59,894 --> 00:58:02,479
My life's a failure because of you!

686
00:58:02,563 --> 00:58:06,150
You've been an eyesore since we were kids.

687
00:58:34,428 --> 00:58:36,472
Are you okay?

688
00:58:37,097 --> 00:58:38,349
Please come this way.

689
00:58:41,852 --> 00:58:44,688
Please keep it there
until the heat goes away.

690
00:58:52,863 --> 00:58:54,823
You seem quite used to this kind of thing.

691
00:58:55,407 --> 00:58:58,452
That's because I was once burned
by this kettle a long time ago.

692
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:02,414
I'm really sorry.

693
00:59:05,834 --> 00:59:07,336
Why are you apologizing?

694
00:59:08,754 --> 00:59:11,507
Because I was the one
who was supposed to get burned.

695
00:59:11,590 --> 00:59:13,634
But then you stepped in...

696
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:15,886
<i>Stepped in?</i>

697
00:59:18,013 --> 00:59:19,390
What the hell is Tokyo Tapioca Land?

698
00:59:19,473 --> 00:59:21,350
Your recklessness just caused a huge loss!

699
00:59:21,433 --> 00:59:22,559
I always knew...

700
00:59:22,643 --> 00:59:24,270
<i>What happens, happens.</i>

701
00:59:25,229 --> 00:59:26,438
It's not responding...

702
00:59:27,523 --> 00:59:29,566
I'm sorry for being late!

703
00:59:30,985 --> 00:59:32,319
Sorry, sorry!

704
00:59:37,866 --> 00:59:39,493
Hey... What're you doing?

705
00:59:40,035 --> 00:59:41,328
Hot, hot!

706
00:59:43,205 --> 00:59:47,167
<i>But if someone steps in to replace you</i>
<i>for that moment, can fate be changed?</i>

707
00:59:47,793 --> 00:59:48,627
What's wrong?

708
00:59:49,962 --> 00:59:50,796
Nothing...

709
00:59:56,927 --> 00:59:58,804
Please go to the hospital right away.

710
01:00:00,097 --> 01:00:01,849
What're you doing at the office?

711
01:00:02,558 --> 01:00:03,892
It's Silver Week.

712
01:00:04,435 --> 01:00:06,270
I have work that I haven't finished.

713
01:00:09,398 --> 01:00:13,610
Ms. Kanbe, you strike me
as a really good person.

714
01:00:15,571 --> 01:00:20,659
I've seen you a lot
both before and after office hours.

715
01:00:21,243 --> 01:00:23,912
You even do work
outside of your own department.

716
01:00:24,955 --> 01:00:25,956
<i>Misa.</i>

717
01:00:27,624 --> 01:00:29,543
Could you put
these documents together for me?

718
01:00:29,668 --> 01:00:31,337
I'm having a hard time now and...

719
01:00:32,379 --> 01:00:33,630
Sure, I'll do it.

720
01:00:34,173 --> 01:00:35,382
You're a huge help.

721
01:00:43,515 --> 01:00:44,767
<i>I guess you can't say no,</i>

722
01:00:45,934 --> 01:00:48,270
even when unreasonable tasks
are forced on you.

723
01:00:51,815 --> 01:00:57,738
You are a kind, hard-working,
self-sacrificing, and good-natured person.

724
01:00:57,821 --> 01:00:59,823
Is that how you think of yourself?

725
01:01:01,784 --> 01:01:02,618
Excuse me?

726
01:01:02,701 --> 01:01:06,914
Do you know why it is that you're
such a magnet for human garbage?

727
01:01:08,374 --> 01:01:12,002
It's not because you're a good person.

728
01:01:13,504 --> 01:01:15,631
It's because you're a naive person.

729
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:21,303
For normal people,

730
01:01:22,262 --> 01:01:23,555
when garbage approaches,

731
01:01:23,639 --> 01:01:25,682
they sense the danger
and keep their distance.

732
01:01:26,767 --> 01:01:29,478
Anyone with a normal eye
for others would notice.

733
01:01:32,064 --> 01:01:34,233
But people like you?

734
01:01:34,316 --> 01:01:36,193
You open your arms wide

735
01:01:36,276 --> 01:01:39,238
and gratefully welcome in
the garbage and scum.

736
01:01:39,321 --> 01:01:41,281
And then, when you inevitably get hurt,

737
01:01:41,365 --> 01:01:44,368
you play the damsel in distress,
silently enduring it.

738
01:01:46,495 --> 01:01:51,750
You let garbage control your life
and steer you right off a cliff,

739
01:01:53,168 --> 01:01:56,422
but still maintain the delusion that
you're some kind, brave soul.

740
01:01:58,215 --> 01:01:59,591
How blissfully naive.

741
01:02:01,176 --> 01:02:02,511
I already knew all that.

742
01:02:05,764 --> 01:02:09,309
You don't have to tell me, I already know!

743
01:02:11,228 --> 01:02:13,814
I happily picked up the garbage
nobody else wanted,

744
01:02:13,897 --> 01:02:17,651
got treated like dirt the whole time,
and still...

745
01:02:18,986 --> 01:02:23,740
I still naively fooled myself
into thinking it was a good life!

746
01:02:25,033 --> 01:02:26,452
I already know that.

747
01:02:27,494 --> 01:02:31,206
I know that the reason things turned out
like this is because I was stupid!

748
01:02:31,957 --> 01:02:32,958
But that doesn't mean

749
01:02:33,041 --> 01:02:36,879
I have to sit here and take this
from some boss who knows nothing about me!

750
01:02:36,962 --> 01:02:38,797
No one, no matter who they are,

751
01:02:38,881 --> 01:02:41,717
has the right
to talk like that about my life!

752
01:02:50,142 --> 01:02:51,226
So you can get angry.

753
01:02:53,854 --> 01:02:58,817
When your dignity is trampled on,
being angry is the right response.

754
01:03:00,861 --> 01:03:02,321
Garbage should be thrown out.

755
01:03:03,489 --> 01:03:08,952
Anyone who doesn't wish for your happiness
has no place in your life.

756
01:03:24,051 --> 01:03:26,053
To thank you for treating my burn.

757
01:03:28,347 --> 01:03:29,806
Remember when you were a kid,

758
01:03:30,557 --> 01:03:33,227
and you popped a sweet candy
into your mouth,

759
01:03:33,310 --> 01:03:34,728
how easy it was to believe?

760
01:03:35,479 --> 01:03:36,980
That you were happy.

761
01:03:54,081 --> 01:03:56,124
{\an8}<i>Welcome home, from Dad.</i>

762
01:04:24,528 --> 01:04:25,696
It's the same.

763
01:04:27,447 --> 01:04:33,662
All you have to do is believe
that you can change your life.

764
01:04:37,082 --> 01:04:38,292
Director Suzuki.

765
01:04:43,088 --> 01:04:46,925
I'm sorry for saying such rude things.

766
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:49,595
Likewise.

767
01:05:22,794 --> 01:05:23,629
Misa Kanbe.

768
01:05:23,712 --> 01:05:25,631
Please become my wife.

769
01:05:27,674 --> 01:05:29,509
I will protect you
for the rest of my life.

770
01:05:29,593 --> 01:05:31,428
I will always make you happy.

771
01:05:43,732 --> 01:05:45,984
<i>That future never came.</i>

772
01:05:47,235 --> 01:05:49,613
<i>You were only kind in the beginning.</i>

773
01:05:50,197 --> 01:05:53,116
<i>You never once wished for my happiness.</i>

774
01:05:55,452 --> 01:05:56,286
Yes.

775
01:05:57,162 --> 01:05:58,372
If you'll have me.

776
01:06:00,791 --> 01:06:02,167
I'd love to.

777
01:06:04,878 --> 01:06:09,216
<i>I was always just a side character</i>
<i>caught up in their story.</i>

778
01:06:10,175 --> 01:06:11,301
I'm sorry, Misa.

779
01:06:11,635 --> 01:06:14,971
Our loneliness just drove us
closer and closer together.

780
01:06:15,055 --> 01:06:17,432
Reina and I
were overwhelmed by your illness, Misa.

781
01:06:18,100 --> 01:06:21,103
It just happened.
We weren't in a normal state of mind.

782
01:06:23,271 --> 01:06:27,275
<i>Take a step back,</i>
<i>and it's a ridiculous third-rate drama.</i>

783
01:06:28,402 --> 01:06:31,947
<i>They're horrible people,</i>
<i>but I was no better.</i>

784
01:06:32,823 --> 01:06:35,617
<i>I'm the one responsible</i>
<i>for ruining my life.</i>

785
01:06:36,493 --> 01:06:37,327
Move over.

786
01:06:43,333 --> 01:06:44,376
Tomoya.

787
01:06:45,669 --> 01:06:47,754
I've decided.

788
01:06:51,091 --> 01:06:56,179
I'm going to be happy, no matter what.

789
01:07:02,978 --> 01:07:04,229
See? it suits you.

790
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:07,274
-I'm here!
-Reina!

791
01:07:08,108 --> 01:07:10,110
He proposed, didn't he?

792
01:07:10,902 --> 01:07:14,698
Actually, Tomoya has been asking me
for advice this whole time.

793
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:17,492
You knew? Come on, you should've told me!

794
01:07:17,576 --> 01:07:19,619
-Congratulations!
-Wow, thanks!

795
01:07:21,830 --> 01:07:23,457
<i>What happens, happens.</i>

796
01:07:24,124 --> 01:07:25,459
<i>The script won't change.</i>

797
01:07:26,418 --> 01:07:27,335
<i>If that's the case,</i>

798
01:07:28,003 --> 01:07:29,963
<i>then I'll just have to change the cast.</i>

799
01:07:30,630 --> 01:07:32,257
Thanks so much.

800
01:07:32,340 --> 01:07:34,426
Oh, no, now I feel like crying too.

801
01:07:40,974 --> 01:07:43,810
MISA: YES, I DO.

802
01:07:43,894 --> 01:07:45,145
YES, I DO.

803
01:07:50,984 --> 01:07:52,652
So, how did you pop the question?

804
01:07:54,237 --> 01:07:55,322
It's a secret.

805
01:07:55,405 --> 01:07:57,491
What the heck! Tell me!

806
01:07:57,574 --> 01:07:59,075
I'm not telling you!

807
01:07:59,159 --> 01:08:00,744
So mean. I'll just ask Misa.

808
01:08:00,827 --> 01:08:02,829
I wonder when
you'll find happiness, Reina.

809
01:08:02,913 --> 01:08:06,833
So mean!
I'll find happiness too, you know!

810
01:08:07,626 --> 01:08:09,503
When I get married...

811
01:08:09,586 --> 01:08:14,299
<i>I'll give my miserable life to you.</i>

812
01:08:15,133 --> 01:08:18,678
<i>Reina, marry my husband.</i>
