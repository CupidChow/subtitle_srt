1
00:00:19,395 --> 00:00:22,106
<i>Reina always stayed by my side.</i>

2
00:00:22,815 --> 00:00:25,693
<i>I'm truly happy, as happy</i>
<i>as if it were happening to me,</i>

3
00:00:25,776 --> 00:00:29,029
that my most precious friend in the world

4
00:00:29,113 --> 00:00:31,031
met a man as wonderful as Tomoya.

5
00:00:32,491 --> 00:00:34,660
Reina, congratulations on your marriage.

6
00:00:34,744 --> 00:00:36,454
And thank you very much.

7
00:00:38,581 --> 00:00:40,833
For picking up the trash I threw away.

8
00:00:47,923 --> 00:00:49,216
Oh, wow!

9
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:56,432
Mom, what's for dinner tonight?

10
00:00:56,515 --> 00:00:58,559
Today, we're having New Year's Eve soba.

11
00:00:58,642 --> 00:01:00,102
-New Year's Eve soba?
-Yeah.

12
00:01:00,186 --> 00:01:01,145
What's that?

13
00:01:01,228 --> 00:01:04,482
Families that eat soba noodles together
on New Year's Eve

14
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:06,859
get to live a healthy life the next year.

15
00:01:06,942 --> 00:01:08,235
Whoa! I can't wait!

16
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:09,153
Can't wait!

17
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:10,237
It's gonna be great!

18
00:01:10,321 --> 00:01:11,489
I want it now!

19
00:01:14,825 --> 00:01:16,952
Mom, where are you going?

20
00:01:17,745 --> 00:01:21,540
Mom! Wait, Mom!

21
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:24,710
Mom, wait!

22
00:01:25,252 --> 00:01:29,715
Mom, Mom, wait!

23
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:34,887
Mom! Mom! Mom!

24
00:01:36,764 --> 00:01:39,975
<i>I was used to being neglected.</i>

25
00:01:40,768 --> 00:01:42,019
<i>Mom!</i>

26
00:01:43,604 --> 00:01:45,731
Where are you going, Mom?

27
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:48,359
Mom, wait!

28
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,986
Mom!

29
00:01:52,988 --> 00:01:54,365
Mom!

30
00:01:55,241 --> 00:01:56,700
Mom!

31
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:00,955
They won't be open this late.

32
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,250
Take care of her.

33
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:05,167
What?

34
00:02:05,835 --> 00:02:08,921
Sorry to interrupt your fun,
but she's your kid, right?

35
00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:12,633
We're closing up the store
and going to the hot springs.

36
00:02:12,716 --> 00:02:16,095
Too bad. If you wanna be with him,
taking care of her is part of the package.

37
00:02:16,554 --> 00:02:18,806
How long are you going
to harass your ex-husband?

38
00:02:18,889 --> 00:02:21,058
You just had to show up
right at the end of the year.

39
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,935
I'm busy with work.

40
00:02:23,018 --> 00:02:25,020
-More like busy with pachinko!
-What?

41
00:02:25,104 --> 00:02:26,397
Wait, it's okay, it's okay.

42
00:02:28,232 --> 00:02:30,276
It's fine, right? Okay, then.

43
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:35,072
Are you okay?

44
00:02:35,823 --> 00:02:37,491
Get a towel to dry her off.

45
00:02:39,201 --> 00:02:41,495
Look, there's something funny on TV.

46
00:02:42,705 --> 00:02:45,124
I was really looking forward
to the hot springs.

47
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:47,001
We can all go together.

48
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:50,129
I don't want to take
a New Year's trip with a kid.

49
00:03:02,224 --> 00:03:03,434
You suck.

50
00:03:06,228 --> 00:03:08,105
Is your life fun?

51
00:03:10,941 --> 00:03:12,318
Of course not.

52
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:15,029
Not with that crazy mother of yours.

53
00:03:17,072 --> 00:03:17,990
That.

54
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:19,783
This?

55
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:21,410
What, you want it?

56
00:03:24,622 --> 00:03:26,707
Want me to teach you how to knit one?

57
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,127
Reina!

58
00:03:30,961 --> 00:03:32,796
What are you doing? We're going home.

59
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,822
Mom, I made this at school today...

60
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:05,871
What's there to be happy about?

61
00:04:05,955 --> 00:04:08,874
I'm having such a hard time every day.

62
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:11,126
Are you trying to piss me off?!

63
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:21,053
{\an8}HAPPY MOTHER'S DAY

64
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:33,232
How can you laugh?

65
00:04:33,315 --> 00:04:34,608
What's the matter with you?

66
00:04:34,692 --> 00:04:36,110
You're just like your father!

67
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:38,404
You're wishing I was dead too, aren't you?

68
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:59,008
<i>Dance at the window side, dederekoden</i>

69
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:06,432
<i>Hail to the festival, dederekoden</i>

70
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:13,981
<i>Dance if you fancy, dance, dance away</i>

71
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:15,566
I'm home.

72
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:20,029
<i>Leave us the little ones</i>

73
00:05:20,696 --> 00:05:22,823
<i>By the window</i>

74
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:26,410
<i>Shall they play</i>

75
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:31,498
<i>The festival has come</i>

76
00:05:32,624 --> 00:05:34,043
I'm gonna die now.

77
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:38,172
Are you happy? Of course you're happy.

78
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:41,425
You want to live
with your father again, don't you?

79
00:05:42,176 --> 00:05:46,138
You have more fun with that woman
than with me, right?

80
00:05:51,185 --> 00:05:54,855
You'd be better off with me dead, right?

81
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,613
Say something!

82
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:06,492
It's all your fault.

83
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:16,919
Reina.

84
00:06:18,128 --> 00:06:22,341
I'm... opening a store in Osaka,

85
00:06:23,217 --> 00:06:25,010
so I can't have you live with me.

86
00:06:26,345 --> 00:06:30,099
Your mother's relatives in Toyama
are coming to pick you up tomorrow.

87
00:06:32,476 --> 00:06:33,352
Take care.

88
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:12,850
REINA ESAKA

89
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:15,936
Let's read manga at my house!

90
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:17,646
Can I come to your house?

91
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:20,732
Yeah! My mom will make pancakes!

92
00:07:20,816 --> 00:07:22,192
-Yay!
-Yay!

93
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,638
I'll give this to you.

94
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,946
I'll be your friend.

95
00:08:34,806 --> 00:08:36,099
{\an8}TOMOYA

96
00:08:37,768 --> 00:08:38,644
What?

97
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:40,812
<i>What do you mean, "What?"</i>

98
00:08:40,896 --> 00:08:42,064
<i>Where are you?</i>

99
00:08:42,147 --> 00:08:43,941
<i>I've been blowing up your phone.</i>

100
00:08:44,816 --> 00:08:47,903
<i>My mom's pissed</i>
<i>about you not helping make the osechi.</i>

101
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:50,906
<i>The whole family's here,</i>
<i>so get over to the house right now!</i>

102
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:33,156
<i>-Say cheese!</i>
<i>-Say cheese!</i>

103
00:09:35,117 --> 00:09:36,785
-Did you take it?
-I got it.

104
00:09:36,868 --> 00:09:39,204
-Let's put this picture up in our rooms!
-Okay!

105
00:09:39,288 --> 00:09:43,000
Hey, Misa, we're best friends, right?

106
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:45,794
What's a "best friend"?

107
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:49,339
<i>Your one and only best friend.</i>

108
00:09:49,423 --> 00:09:51,842
<i>No matter what happens,</i>
<i>they never leave you.</i>

109
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:53,552
<i>Together forever!</i>

110
00:09:53,635 --> 00:09:55,095
Together forever?

111
00:09:55,178 --> 00:09:56,096
Yup!

112
00:09:56,722 --> 00:09:58,974
Reina, you're my best friend!

113
00:10:48,023 --> 00:10:51,234
This is the most peaceful New Year's
I've had in a long time.

114
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:53,487
It's usually not peaceful?

115
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:55,572
The hellish osechi training...

116
00:10:57,532 --> 00:10:58,867
Oh, nothing.

117
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:01,078
Here it is! The roast beef.

118
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:03,455
-Whoa, looks good!
-Wow, amazing!

119
00:11:04,247 --> 00:11:07,334
It'd be nice with wasabi,
but I forgot to buy it.

120
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:08,710
I might have the tube kind.

121
00:11:08,794 --> 00:11:10,504
-Oh, really?
-Yeah. I'll go get it.

122
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:11,421
Thanks.

123
00:11:11,922 --> 00:11:13,340
-Thank you.
-Sure!

124
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:25,644
Wasabi, wasabi...

125
00:11:27,646 --> 00:11:28,855
Let's see...

126
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:30,690
Here it is.

127
00:11:35,654 --> 00:11:38,281
<i>Are the next-door neighbors</i>
<i>coming back in the spring?</i>

128
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:41,701
The owner offered a discount
for a short-term lease.

129
00:11:42,077 --> 00:11:44,538
I'm glad Ms. Kanbe was able
to find a place to stay.

130
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:47,457
She needed a place to live
on such short notice, so...

131
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:50,043
Why don't you just
drop the whole neighbor charade

132
00:11:50,127 --> 00:11:52,087
and let her move in here already?

133
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:55,006
We're not in that kind of relationship...

134
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:57,134
You're not?

135
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:01,221
No, we're not.

136
00:12:22,451 --> 00:12:24,286
Which one, green tea or hojicha?

137
00:12:24,786 --> 00:12:26,329
-Anything's fine.
-Okay.

138
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,023
For tea...

139
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:56,568
I recommend this.

140
00:12:57,903 --> 00:12:58,945
Thank you.

141
00:13:00,822 --> 00:13:02,199
Miku, here.

142
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:03,283
Thank you.

143
00:13:07,746 --> 00:13:12,250
Five, four, three, two, one!

144
00:13:16,755 --> 00:13:18,924
Happy New Year.

145
00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:20,967
Happy New Year.

146
00:13:21,927 --> 00:13:26,223
-Ms. Kanbe! Happy New Year!
-Happy New Year!

147
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:27,724
Watch out, watch out!

148
00:13:28,517 --> 00:13:30,060
Are you okay?

149
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:33,396
Kamekichi, Happy New Year!

150
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,565
Looking forward
to seeing you more in 2016!

151
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:03,760
When did those two get so close?

152
00:14:04,636 --> 00:14:07,597
I think it's most likely
a one-sided thing on her part.

153
00:14:07,681 --> 00:14:09,516
Oh, is that so?

154
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:12,769
Anyway, have things
calmed down a bit for you?

155
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:17,190
Yes. Thank you for
suggesting the apartment.

156
00:14:17,816 --> 00:14:20,694
I'd be worried if you
moved in somewhere dangerous.

157
00:14:22,404 --> 00:14:25,740
I will be your neighbor for a while.

158
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:28,243
Kamekichi will be thrilled.

159
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:37,043
The first sunrise of the new year.

160
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:46,553
It's the beginning of a new life.

161
00:14:47,512 --> 00:14:48,388
Right.

162
00:15:20,295 --> 00:15:21,296
Oh yeah.

163
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:22,797
What?

164
00:15:29,346 --> 00:15:31,723
Wait, don't tell me that's
New Year's money?

165
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:33,600
That's not it.

166
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:35,101
Here you go.

167
00:15:56,373 --> 00:15:57,916
Thank you for waiting.

168
00:16:04,547 --> 00:16:07,509
I endured my slicing with gratitude.

169
00:16:07,592 --> 00:16:10,136
They said the results
should be ready in about a week.

170
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:12,514
Sorry, it wasn't a very romantic gift.

171
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:18,853
Why did you decide to give me
a health exam as a gift?

172
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:22,816
I thought the gift
should be something practical.

173
00:16:23,358 --> 00:16:25,777
You've seemed tired over
these past few months.

174
00:16:26,403 --> 00:16:30,782
Well, I certainly can't afford such
a state-of-the-art exam myself, so...

175
00:16:30,865 --> 00:16:32,450
I'll treat you to this regularly.

176
00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:35,745
Why?

177
00:16:39,207 --> 00:16:41,167
Our bodies are our greatest asset.

178
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:51,720
I'm glad that you're well.

179
00:16:52,262 --> 00:16:57,142
I'm never... going to let you die again.

180
00:16:58,059 --> 00:17:00,770
So, how many years has it been?
At least...

181
00:17:00,854 --> 00:17:02,063
Twenty years.

182
00:17:02,147 --> 00:17:05,525
Yeah! Time really flies, doesn't it?

183
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:07,819
-What?
-It's been ten years.

184
00:17:08,486 --> 00:17:10,029
<i>About ten years.</i>

185
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:13,283
<i>Remember when you were a kid,</i>

186
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:15,952
and you popped a sweet candy
into your mouth,

187
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,370
how easy it was to believe?

188
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:19,205
That you were happy.

189
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:23,251
Three o'clock snacks.

190
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:32,218
Director.

191
00:17:34,471 --> 00:17:37,807
Is there... something you haven't told me?

192
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:42,604
What are you talking about?

193
00:17:43,313 --> 00:17:45,106
Why are you looking away?

194
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:53,239
You don't seem like the type to lie
when asked directly.

195
00:17:56,659 --> 00:17:57,827
By any chance...

196
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:02,123
have you met my father somewhere?

197
00:18:19,974 --> 00:18:21,684
Oh, you're both here.

198
00:18:25,688 --> 00:18:28,107
My husband isn't feeling well.

199
00:18:28,191 --> 00:18:30,193
It can't be helped at his age.

200
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:34,030
You've been coming here
so long. Sorry to disappoint.

201
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:34,948
Oh, no...

202
00:18:35,031 --> 00:18:39,035
But I'm happy
I got to see your faces one last time.

203
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,207
Thank you for everything.

204
00:18:44,749 --> 00:18:46,042
No, thank you.

205
00:19:14,195 --> 00:19:15,655
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

206
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:17,991
Is Mr. Kawakami here?

207
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,036
I'm Kawakami.

208
00:19:22,537 --> 00:19:25,206
I'm Hirano, the one you
helped with the contract

209
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:27,250
for the condo in
Honcho District Four last year.

210
00:19:28,376 --> 00:19:31,629
You're Mr. Hirano's wife, I see.
We spoke several times on the phone.

211
00:19:31,713 --> 00:19:34,549
Yes. I'm Misa... Hirano.

212
00:19:34,632 --> 00:19:37,260
Oh, yes, yes. Ms. Misa.

213
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:39,846
I had some errands nearby
and wanted to say hello.

214
00:19:40,763 --> 00:19:43,141
Oh, thank you so much.

215
00:19:43,224 --> 00:19:47,103
And also... I'd like to check
on something here.

216
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:49,939
-It's cold.
-Yeah, it is.

217
00:19:50,023 --> 00:19:50,940
So cold!

218
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,735
We should have something warm.

219
00:19:53,818 --> 00:19:55,528
Something warm? Like what?

220
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:58,406
Udon, ramen...

221
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:14,339
Hirano. How's that report coming along?

222
00:20:15,173 --> 00:20:17,258
Yes... I'm working on it.

223
00:20:19,344 --> 00:20:21,471
{\an8}You're so damn slow.

224
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:23,598
{\an8}SALES DEPARTMENT

225
00:20:23,681 --> 00:20:26,559
{\an8}I heard Hirano got removed
from the project.

226
00:20:27,685 --> 00:20:29,520
He's just a gofer now!

227
00:20:29,604 --> 00:20:32,273
They're saying he might get transferred.

228
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:34,192
Well, yeah,

229
00:20:34,275 --> 00:20:36,778
anyone who cheats on their fiancée
with her best friend

230
00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:40,990
then actually marries the homewrecker
is bound to fall off the fast track.

231
00:20:41,074 --> 00:20:42,241
He's finished.

232
00:20:43,076 --> 00:20:43,910
Right?

233
00:20:57,131 --> 00:20:58,675
LUCKY LOAN, LLC

234
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:11,980
{\an8}What's wrong?

235
00:21:13,815 --> 00:21:16,818
{\an8}My favorite Japanese confectionery
shop is closing down.

236
00:21:16,901 --> 00:21:20,488
You know, Mamekame-dou, who helped us
with the Shine Muscat Daifuku before.

237
00:21:20,989 --> 00:21:22,407
Oh, no...

238
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:24,659
I heard the owner's
having health problems.

239
00:21:26,077 --> 00:21:28,371
He was quite old, wasn't he?

240
00:21:29,122 --> 00:21:31,082
It's really sad, but...

241
00:21:31,165 --> 00:21:34,127
I guess... there's nothing
we can do about it.

242
00:21:37,964 --> 00:21:40,091
Something got you down too, Ms. Sumiyoshi?

243
00:21:40,174 --> 00:21:41,718
We're here if you need to talk.

244
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:45,471
-Well...
-Yeah.

245
00:21:47,932 --> 00:21:50,518
My husband... is having an affair...

246
00:21:50,601 --> 00:21:52,020
-An affair?!
-Hey, Miku!

247
00:21:52,979 --> 00:21:56,107
I mean... Just when things
finally settled down for you,

248
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:57,525
now she has to deal with this?

249
00:21:57,608 --> 00:21:59,777
Ms. Sumiyoshi, are you sure?

250
00:21:59,861 --> 00:22:00,903
Yeah...

251
00:22:00,987 --> 00:22:02,697
I walked in on it happening.

252
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:05,950
At the restaurant,
with the college student part-timer...

253
00:22:06,034 --> 00:22:07,285
They were kissing.

254
00:22:07,368 --> 00:22:09,287
What... With a girl that young?

255
00:22:10,455 --> 00:22:12,415
He seems to be hanging around her place

256
00:22:12,999 --> 00:22:14,459
and supporting her financially

257
00:22:14,542 --> 00:22:17,336
with the restaurant's earnings
and our daughter's education fund.

258
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:19,464
{\an8}-Huh?!
-What?

259
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:23,092
{\an8}I'm leaving Riko with my mother tonight.

260
00:22:23,176 --> 00:22:24,886
I thought I'd catch him in the act.

261
00:22:25,595 --> 00:22:27,513
Will you be okay by yourself?

262
00:22:28,723 --> 00:22:32,518
I've gotta deal with this properly,
for my daughter's sake too.

263
00:22:34,687 --> 00:22:36,522
I'll... go with you.

264
00:22:36,981 --> 00:22:37,815
Me too.

265
00:22:50,078 --> 00:22:51,746
NANA KOZUKI

266
00:23:06,469 --> 00:23:08,805
-...I told you, I bought it.
-Yeah.

267
00:23:09,097 --> 00:23:10,848
-Where is this?
-Like... a short vacation.

268
00:23:10,932 --> 00:23:12,391
About 30 minutes away.

269
00:23:12,475 --> 00:23:14,477
-I see.
-Not today though.

270
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,394
-I can't.
-Let's go!

271
00:23:15,478 --> 00:23:17,105
-I can't.
-Why not? Let's just go!

272
00:23:17,188 --> 00:23:19,440
-No, I can't. I can't.
-Come on! Why not?

273
00:23:19,524 --> 00:23:20,525
-Why not?
-I'll get tired.

274
00:23:20,608 --> 00:23:21,442
Get tired?

275
00:23:21,526 --> 00:23:24,487
Well, we'll have the money
by the new year at the latest.

276
00:23:27,573 --> 00:23:31,536
There you go again.
Have a little faith in me.

277
00:23:32,578 --> 00:23:34,580
Niboshi? Maybe...

278
00:23:34,664 --> 00:23:36,624
-It's quite light.
-Oh really?

279
00:23:36,707 --> 00:23:38,000
Yeah, that's better...

280
00:23:38,084 --> 00:23:39,418
What are you doing?

281
00:23:43,089 --> 00:23:44,048
What the hell?

282
00:23:44,132 --> 00:23:46,342
-Hey... This is my house!
-What are you doing?

283
00:23:46,843 --> 00:23:49,095
You have a child.
Aren't you ashamed?!

284
00:23:51,764 --> 00:23:54,016
You're destroying
your family like it's nothing!

285
00:23:54,517 --> 00:23:56,185
Hey, how can you trample

286
00:23:56,269 --> 00:23:58,896
-on people's feelings like this?
<i>-How can you trample</i>

287
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,523
...on people's feelings like this?

288
00:24:01,399 --> 00:24:03,609
-Hey, cut it out, old lady!
-Huh?

289
00:24:03,693 --> 00:24:06,320
-Playing the victim!
-Playing the victim.

290
00:24:06,988 --> 00:24:07,989
Ms. Kanbe.

291
00:24:08,072 --> 00:24:09,490
Your husband was unhappy.

292
00:24:09,574 --> 00:24:11,826
He says you're always too busy for him

293
00:24:11,909 --> 00:24:14,328
and even when you are around,
you never comfort him.

294
00:24:14,412 --> 00:24:16,706
You complained so much,
I figured you didn't want him anymore.

295
00:24:16,914 --> 00:24:19,083
Are you going to make me the villain
over a single mistake?

296
00:24:19,167 --> 00:24:21,878
My life's a failure because of you!

297
00:24:22,879 --> 00:24:25,715
I'm telling your parents about this.

298
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:27,633
Huh?

299
00:24:28,092 --> 00:24:29,886
Hey. Wait...

300
00:24:33,931 --> 00:24:34,849
No.

301
00:24:39,604 --> 00:24:40,688
Listen to me.

302
00:24:40,771 --> 00:24:41,898
I've heard enough.

303
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:44,150
-Hand it over.
-Let go of me.

304
00:24:44,233 --> 00:24:46,110
I said hand it over!

305
00:24:47,028 --> 00:24:48,571
Stop!

306
00:24:48,654 --> 00:24:49,614
Hand it over!

307
00:24:49,697 --> 00:24:50,740
Stop!

308
00:24:51,866 --> 00:24:52,783
No!

309
00:24:52,867 --> 00:24:55,203
Come on, you stupid bitch! Hand it over.

310
00:24:55,286 --> 00:24:57,038
Shut up, let go!

311
00:24:57,121 --> 00:24:58,539
Give it to me!

312
00:25:07,131 --> 00:25:07,965
Manager!

313
00:25:10,176 --> 00:25:12,178
Ms. Kanbe, are you okay?

314
00:25:21,479 --> 00:25:22,647
Ms. Sumiyoshi!

315
00:25:39,914 --> 00:25:41,082
Riko, let's go.

316
00:25:56,931 --> 00:25:58,975
Are you okay, Ms. Sumiyoshi?

317
00:25:59,058 --> 00:26:01,769
I'm totally fine. Just banged up.

318
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:05,856
That was pretty pathetic, huh?

319
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:11,445
Don't worry. I can go home
as soon as the test results come back.

320
00:26:13,781 --> 00:26:14,782
Ms. Sumiyoshi.

321
00:26:17,827 --> 00:26:19,078
How's the pain?

322
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:22,081
Thank you for your help. I am fine now.

323
00:26:22,665 --> 00:26:26,335
There was nothing wrong with the bone,
but it is still swollen, so please rest.

324
00:26:26,419 --> 00:26:28,087
-Yes.
-And...

325
00:26:28,671 --> 00:26:30,339
when did the abdominal pain start?

326
00:26:31,841 --> 00:26:34,218
Around the end of the year.

327
00:26:35,511 --> 00:26:37,346
I think it's just stress.

328
00:26:38,723 --> 00:26:41,934
I think it's just stress.

329
00:26:42,018 --> 00:26:43,102
I see.

330
00:26:43,728 --> 00:26:45,855
I have some concerns,

331
00:26:46,439 --> 00:26:49,984
so could I ask you to stay in the hospital
for a detailed examination?

332
00:26:51,235 --> 00:26:52,361
I have some concerns,

333
00:26:52,445 --> 00:26:55,197
so could I ask you to stay in the hospital
for a detailed examination?

334
00:26:56,032 --> 00:26:57,199
Oh, okay.

335
00:27:03,497 --> 00:27:06,208
<i>What is Reina thinking?</i>

336
00:27:06,292 --> 00:27:08,961
<i>She didn't show up for New Year's either.</i>

337
00:27:09,045 --> 00:27:10,671
<i>You said she wasn't feeling well,</i>

338
00:27:10,755 --> 00:27:13,090
<i>but when I went to your apartment,</i>
<i>she wasn't there.</i>

339
00:27:13,174 --> 00:27:16,761
I don't know what's going on either.
She doesn't communicate at all.

340
00:27:16,844 --> 00:27:19,221
<i>Is the baby okay?</i>

341
00:27:19,305 --> 00:27:21,932
<i>Tomo, when are you coming?</i>

342
00:27:22,016 --> 00:27:24,352
Like I said, I'm almost there.
Ten more secon--

343
00:27:25,728 --> 00:27:27,313
<i>This is Hirano.</i>

344
00:27:27,396 --> 00:27:28,356
Excuse me,

345
00:27:28,439 --> 00:27:31,108
is this Tomoya Hirano's residence?

346
00:27:31,192 --> 00:27:36,280
We're here because we can't reach
Tomoya about repaying his loan.

347
00:27:37,198 --> 00:27:38,741
Come out of there, you son of a bitch.

348
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:56,592
I'm home.

349
00:27:57,468 --> 00:27:58,386
Welcome home.

350
00:27:58,928 --> 00:28:00,179
You must be hungry.

351
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:01,764
Dinner's ready.

352
00:28:11,273 --> 00:28:12,441
{\an8}MOM

353
00:28:16,153 --> 00:28:19,990
Today, I paid
the real estate agent a visit.

354
00:28:21,575 --> 00:28:22,410
Okay.

355
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:27,665
The salesman thought I was Misa, though.

356
00:28:32,044 --> 00:28:36,966
I don't really mind that it's the condo
you were going to live in with Misa.

357
00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:38,384
It's a nice place,

358
00:28:38,926 --> 00:28:40,594
and we're the ones living here.

359
00:28:41,137 --> 00:28:45,391
But... there's one thing
that's been bothering me.

360
00:28:46,809 --> 00:28:47,977
Something bothering you?

361
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:50,354
Misa bragged to me about it before.

362
00:28:50,438 --> 00:28:53,023
She said that your investments
were doing well enough

363
00:28:53,107 --> 00:28:56,402
to make a much larger
down payment on the condo.

364
00:28:56,902 --> 00:28:58,946
But apparently, that wasn't true.

365
00:29:00,281 --> 00:29:02,825
It was Misa who made
the down payment, wasn't it?

366
00:29:04,702 --> 00:29:06,787
I wonder what that means.

367
00:29:07,997 --> 00:29:08,914
At that time,

368
00:29:08,998 --> 00:29:12,251
I was temporarily short on cash,
so I borrowed some from Misa...

369
00:29:12,334 --> 00:29:16,464
Temporarily? Just now, some guys came by
saying you owed them money.

370
00:29:16,547 --> 00:29:20,551
Scary men.
Are they loan sharks or something?

371
00:29:27,141 --> 00:29:28,559
Tomoya,

372
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:33,731
I won't get angry
if you're honest with me.

373
00:29:40,613 --> 00:29:42,323
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

374
00:29:43,449 --> 00:29:44,950
I got scammed.

375
00:29:45,576 --> 00:29:49,121
I got scammed into investing
in cryptocurrency, and because of that,

376
00:29:49,205 --> 00:29:55,252
I took out loans from the bank, got cash
advances, borrowed from loan sharks...

377
00:29:55,336 --> 00:29:56,295
How much?

378
00:30:00,549 --> 00:30:01,425
How much?

379
00:30:03,969 --> 00:30:05,763
Twenty-six million in total.

380
00:30:10,601 --> 00:30:17,191
I wonder why Misa didn't tell me
that you were in this much debt.

381
00:30:18,108 --> 00:30:23,155
Misa told me to keep quiet about her
making the down payment on the condo.

382
00:30:23,239 --> 00:30:26,033
You know how she likes to
make her man the star.

383
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,502
Let's eat.

384
00:30:40,756 --> 00:30:42,132
I'm sorry, Reina.

385
00:30:42,716 --> 00:30:46,011
I have to sell this condo
or I'll be in some real trouble.

386
00:30:46,095 --> 00:30:48,889
Let's stay with my parents
for a while to rebuild.

387
00:30:49,557 --> 00:30:51,433
My mom will help us out,

388
00:30:51,517 --> 00:30:53,352
and I have ways to earn us some money.

389
00:30:53,936 --> 00:30:56,480
It may be a little uncomfortable for you,

390
00:30:57,106 --> 00:30:59,149
but it's for the sake of our unborn child.

391
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:07,324
Reina, something that spicy might be...

392
00:31:09,994 --> 00:31:11,745
Bad for the baby?

393
00:31:25,301 --> 00:31:28,387
Reina, we can't just give up over this.

394
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:30,764
-We're going to be parents.
-I lied.

395
00:31:31,807 --> 00:31:32,641
You lied?

396
00:31:33,142 --> 00:31:34,435
I'm not pregnant.

397
00:31:40,983 --> 00:31:45,863
I lied because I wanted
to steal you away from Misa.

398
00:31:49,116 --> 00:31:51,368
Wait a minute, what do you mean?

399
00:31:51,952 --> 00:31:54,496
You lied about being pregnant
to get me to marry you?

400
00:31:55,164 --> 00:31:56,123
That's what I said.

401
00:31:56,874 --> 00:32:01,003
If the pregnancy was a lie,
then I didn't have to marry you.

402
00:32:02,379 --> 00:32:03,505
Huh?

403
00:32:03,589 --> 00:32:07,134
You think it's okay to just
mess up someone's life like that?

404
00:32:07,217 --> 00:32:09,720
-I didn't mess up anything.
-Huh?

405
00:32:09,803 --> 00:32:12,473
It was Misa.
Misa orchestrated the whole thing.

406
00:32:12,556 --> 00:32:13,807
Don't pin it on someone else.

407
00:32:13,891 --> 00:32:17,102
Do you know who Misa is living with now?

408
00:32:17,978 --> 00:32:18,854
Wataru Suzuki.

409
00:32:21,398 --> 00:32:23,192
Misa moved out of her cheap apartment

410
00:32:23,275 --> 00:32:26,403
and is living with Director Suzuki
in an upscale neighborhood.

411
00:32:28,155 --> 00:32:30,991
<i>I knew it. So, Misa really is dating him?</i>

412
00:32:31,075 --> 00:32:33,827
How could she move on so quickly
after breaking up with me?

413
00:32:33,911 --> 00:32:35,829
Use your head, you idiot.

414
00:32:35,913 --> 00:32:38,666
It's been going on
for a lot longer than that.

415
00:32:38,749 --> 00:32:40,834
The two of them have likely been together

416
00:32:40,918 --> 00:32:43,337
since before we went
to the Shine Muscat vineyards.

417
00:32:44,338 --> 00:32:48,717
If you think about it that way,
it all makes sense.

418
00:32:48,801 --> 00:32:51,512
You mean Misa was two-timing me?

419
00:32:52,304 --> 00:32:53,430
That can't be...

420
00:32:54,264 --> 00:32:56,266
Didn't you think it was strange?

421
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:58,560
She has obviously changed.

422
00:32:58,644 --> 00:33:04,316
Our Misa, always insecure,
frightened, and submissive,

423
00:33:04,942 --> 00:33:07,778
is now suddenly rebellious and even
domineering at times.

424
00:33:09,029 --> 00:33:11,699
It's because she got Wataru Suzuki.

425
00:33:12,366 --> 00:33:14,702
-You're lying.
-She fed me lie after lie

426
00:33:14,785 --> 00:33:16,704
to trick me into taking you away from her!

427
00:33:16,787 --> 00:33:19,415
She planned the whole thing
to make us look like the villains

428
00:33:19,498 --> 00:33:22,334
so she could be with Director Suzuki
without hiding it!

429
00:33:22,418 --> 00:33:23,293
You're lying.

430
00:33:23,377 --> 00:33:26,672
Use that little brain of yours
and think for a minute!

431
00:33:26,755 --> 00:33:28,215
Who would want to marry you?

432
00:33:28,298 --> 00:33:31,719
A debt-ridden mommy's boy
who can't even do his job.

433
00:33:31,802 --> 00:33:33,762
-Shut up.
-And as proof,

434
00:33:33,846 --> 00:33:37,516
-guess what she said to me at our wedding?
-Just shut up.

435
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:41,854
She smiled at me and said, "Thank you
for picking up the trash I threw away."

436
00:33:41,937 --> 00:33:43,605
I told you to shut u--

437
00:33:46,942 --> 00:33:49,486
Come on, wake up already.

438
00:33:50,779 --> 00:33:51,822
That bitch...

439
00:33:52,531 --> 00:33:56,827
threw us both away like worthless trash
just to make herself happy.

440
00:33:58,370 --> 00:33:59,747
We were both...

441
00:34:00,789 --> 00:34:02,624
tricked by Misa, can't you see?!

442
00:34:04,835 --> 00:34:06,044
Damn it.

443
00:34:06,128 --> 00:34:09,298
Damn it, damn it, damn it!

444
00:34:09,923 --> 00:34:12,009
I'll never forgive her!

445
00:34:12,092 --> 00:34:16,680
I'm going to take it all away from her,
just like she did to me.

446
00:34:16,764 --> 00:34:21,518
I'm going to rip her happy life to shreds!

447
00:34:22,728 --> 00:34:24,396
Is that true?

448
00:34:28,901 --> 00:34:30,402
Tomo.

449
00:34:31,779 --> 00:34:33,322
What she just said,

450
00:34:33,947 --> 00:34:35,449
is that true?

451
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:38,869
Mom, how long have you been listening?

452
00:34:38,952 --> 00:34:41,246
You said there's no baby...

453
00:34:41,872 --> 00:34:42,873
No...

454
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:46,084
Mom?

455
00:34:46,794 --> 00:34:48,003
Mom!

456
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:50,339
Mom!

457
00:34:52,633 --> 00:34:55,219
Wait... Mom!

458
00:35:04,645 --> 00:35:05,854
Good morning.

459
00:35:05,938 --> 00:35:06,855
Morning.

460
00:35:06,939 --> 00:35:09,733
Ms. Sumiyoshi, have you already recovered?

461
00:35:11,068 --> 00:35:13,487
Ms. Kanbe, can we talk for a minute?

462
00:35:20,369 --> 00:35:21,995
I got the test results back.

463
00:35:24,498 --> 00:35:25,582
I have cancer.

464
00:35:28,377 --> 00:35:30,254
It's just one thing after another, huh?

465
00:35:30,337 --> 00:35:32,840
This just blows the affair
out of the water.

466
00:35:36,218 --> 00:35:39,471
I'm going to be in the hospital a lot,

467
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:45,310
so I'm hoping you can handle
the Shine Muscat project.

468
00:35:47,396 --> 00:35:48,981
Sorry to spring it on you like this.

469
00:35:51,483 --> 00:35:52,901
I'll go talk to the higher-ups.

470
00:35:53,777 --> 00:35:55,237
Please wait a minute.

471
00:35:55,904 --> 00:35:59,658
That's... That's just...

472
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:06,915
I know you can do this.

473
00:36:07,791 --> 00:36:10,043
We launched this project together, right?

474
00:36:11,837 --> 00:36:15,424
Please, see it through for me.

475
00:36:45,454 --> 00:36:48,665
{\an8}MEDICAL EXAMINATION REPORT
OVERALL HEALTH: EXCELLENT

476
00:36:58,216 --> 00:36:59,217
Excuse me.

477
00:37:06,475 --> 00:37:08,393
Her daughter is still young.

478
00:37:10,938 --> 00:37:16,026
It's awful. At 37 years old,
I can't believe it.

479
00:37:17,444 --> 00:37:18,737
Excuse me...

480
00:37:20,822 --> 00:37:22,157
Did something happen?

481
00:37:24,493 --> 00:37:26,954
Hey, is Hirano not here today again?

482
00:37:28,163 --> 00:37:30,916
No. We can't reach him
on the phone either.

483
00:37:32,084 --> 00:37:34,461
What is he thinking,
missing work without notice?

484
00:37:35,504 --> 00:37:36,588
Yeah.

485
00:37:39,299 --> 00:37:41,760
Okay, work. Back to work.

486
00:38:00,529 --> 00:38:01,613
It's been a while.

487
00:38:07,327 --> 00:38:09,204
DELIVERY COMPANY

00:38:12,165 --> 00:38:13,625
CLIENTS

491
00:38:30,976 --> 00:38:31,810
Hello.

492
00:38:33,145 --> 00:38:34,312
Hello.

493
00:38:35,647 --> 00:38:37,566
Are you still working?

494
00:38:38,066 --> 00:38:40,777
The lights in Corporate Strategy
are the only ones still on.

495
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:44,573
And you?

496
00:38:44,656 --> 00:38:46,616
<i>I just left the office.</i>

497
00:38:47,826 --> 00:38:48,785
Um...

498
00:38:50,912 --> 00:38:53,373
If you have time tonight...

499
00:38:54,041 --> 00:38:55,917
there's something
I want to talk to you about.

500
00:38:56,001 --> 00:38:57,753
I'll be leaving soon.

501
00:38:57,836 --> 00:38:59,838
-If you can wait at home--
-<i>Misa.</i>

502
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:08,764
It's been a while.

503
00:39:11,016 --> 00:39:12,726
Who were you talking to?

504
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:17,397
You don't answer my calls or LINE,

505
00:39:18,023 --> 00:39:19,733
and I heard you've moved?

506
00:39:21,109 --> 00:39:22,277
You are so thorough.

507
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,905
For the beginning of your new life...

508
00:39:25,864 --> 00:39:27,240
Congratulations!

509
00:39:30,118 --> 00:39:31,036
Misa,

510
00:39:31,828 --> 00:39:36,500
you left the bouquet that Reina gave you
at the wedding.

511
00:39:36,583 --> 00:39:39,252
It wasn't pain that
made you leave it there.

512
00:39:40,087 --> 00:39:42,255
I was closest to you,

513
00:39:42,756 --> 00:39:44,341
but I didn't notice any of it.

514
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:48,845
I didn't realize that you
needed more as a woman.

515
00:39:50,347 --> 00:39:52,224
We have a lot to talk about,

516
00:39:52,891 --> 00:39:55,185
so can I hang out at your new place?

517
00:39:56,228 --> 00:39:58,396
I hear it's a real nice place.

518
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:05,570
My life is a mess.

519
00:40:05,654 --> 00:40:09,074
I married a woman I don't even like,
and my mom collapsed!

520
00:40:12,035 --> 00:40:14,454
She collapsed?

521
00:40:14,538 --> 00:40:16,123
She had a stroke.

522
00:40:17,457 --> 00:40:19,376
She might end up dying.

523
00:40:22,212 --> 00:40:23,421
She'll be fine.

524
00:40:23,505 --> 00:40:25,340
Rehab will take some time,

525
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:27,384
but you'll be surprised how healthy she--

526
00:40:27,467 --> 00:40:29,052
You hypocrite!

527
00:40:31,012 --> 00:40:34,766
This is your fault! It's all your fault!

528
00:40:49,322 --> 00:40:50,365
Misa.

529
00:40:55,078 --> 00:40:56,288
Stop!

530
00:40:56,663 --> 00:40:57,622
Let go of me!

531
00:41:03,128 --> 00:41:06,631
Who's trash? Who's trash?

532
00:41:08,175 --> 00:41:09,384
Say it.

533
00:41:11,928 --> 00:41:14,139
What part of me is trash?

534
00:41:23,857 --> 00:41:25,150
Are you okay?

535
00:41:34,534 --> 00:41:36,244
Who the hell do you think you are?

536
00:41:37,037 --> 00:41:38,538
It's your fault.

537
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:41,416
Everything, it's all your fault!

538
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:05,106
So, it was true,

539
00:42:06,399 --> 00:42:07,943
what Reina said.

540
00:42:09,903 --> 00:42:12,030
That you set it all up.

541
00:42:12,697 --> 00:42:16,201
That you put me and Reina together
when you didn't need us anymore.

542
00:42:22,582 --> 00:42:24,834
You're a real piece of work, Misa.

543
00:42:27,045 --> 00:42:28,338
You told me once, didn't you?

544
00:42:29,256 --> 00:42:31,591
To take responsibility for what I do.

545
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:35,804
Well, it's you who needs
to take responsibility now!

546
00:42:37,973 --> 00:42:40,976
You don't get to just
leave with him and be happy.

547
00:42:42,018 --> 00:42:44,854
You deserve to die for what you did.

548
00:43:06,876 --> 00:43:08,128
It's my family's second house.

549
00:43:08,628 --> 00:43:10,547
Only my family members know the location.

550
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:12,340
I've also requested security.

551
00:43:13,925 --> 00:43:17,637
I'm having my sister bring
a change of clothes and daily necessities.

552
00:43:18,346 --> 00:43:19,389
You can relax now.

553
00:43:22,851 --> 00:43:24,227
Please wait.

554
00:43:25,937 --> 00:43:27,022
Before that...

555
00:43:33,153 --> 00:43:34,446
Does it hurt?

556
00:43:34,529 --> 00:43:35,488
No.

557
00:43:37,407 --> 00:43:39,909
I'm sure you've never been
in a fight before.

558
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:42,370
Don't underestimate me.

559
00:43:42,912 --> 00:43:45,415
I actually used to
go to a karate dojo when I was a kid.

560
00:43:45,874 --> 00:43:47,083
Is that true?

561
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:49,669
I stopped at white belt, though.

562
00:44:11,691 --> 00:44:12,859
Thank you.

563
00:44:13,401 --> 00:44:14,402
Don't mention it.

564
00:44:35,507 --> 00:44:36,341
Um...

565
00:44:39,177 --> 00:44:41,721
I have something to tell you.

566
00:44:46,643 --> 00:44:47,685
I...

567
00:44:51,231 --> 00:44:52,399
I've...

568
00:44:53,525 --> 00:44:54,818
died once before.

569
00:44:58,696 --> 00:45:00,073
I was murdered...

570
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:02,367
in 2025.

571
00:45:02,992 --> 00:45:06,121
Tomoya and Reina pushed me
off the condo building.

572
00:45:07,789 --> 00:45:09,958
And then I found myself
ten years in the past.

573
00:45:11,209 --> 00:45:13,253
That's when I met you.

574
00:45:14,838 --> 00:45:17,257
I started to dream that...

575
00:45:18,842 --> 00:45:23,555
maybe I could live this life with you,
that I could have a second chance.

576
00:45:25,181 --> 00:45:26,224
But then...

577
00:45:29,185 --> 00:45:30,520
Ms. Sumiyoshi...

578
00:45:33,273 --> 00:45:34,774
got cancer,

579
00:45:36,526 --> 00:45:38,528
a disease she was never supposed to get.

580
00:45:39,112 --> 00:45:40,572
She got it instead of me.

581
00:45:43,783 --> 00:45:45,535
Because she got involved with me.

582
00:45:48,538 --> 00:45:50,373
I never wanted that.

583
00:45:51,666 --> 00:45:52,917
If this is what it costs,

584
00:45:54,377 --> 00:45:56,754
then I never should have
taken this second life.

585
00:46:00,967 --> 00:46:03,636
Before it's too late to save her life...

586
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:05,513
I have...

587
00:46:06,973 --> 00:46:09,350
no other choice but to end my own.

588
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:12,604
But still,

589
00:46:14,022 --> 00:46:15,773
getting to meet you...

590
00:46:18,651 --> 00:46:21,070
and getting to dream about
so many wonderful things...

591
00:46:23,990 --> 00:46:25,950
Even if it was only for a few months...

592
00:46:28,745 --> 00:46:33,124
getting to spend
this second life with you...

593
00:46:35,376 --> 00:46:37,337
it made me so...

594
00:46:38,671 --> 00:46:40,590
so happy.

595
00:47:15,542 --> 00:47:17,210
What are you talking about?

596
00:47:21,130 --> 00:47:23,591
Do you really expect...

597
00:47:25,009 --> 00:47:28,346
an adult to believe
such a ridiculous story?

598
00:47:30,890 --> 00:47:33,476
It is true that I was attracted to you.

599
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:34,477
However...

600
00:47:36,854 --> 00:47:38,773
after hearing what you just said,

601
00:47:39,315 --> 00:47:41,067
I no longer have that feeling.

602
00:47:44,112 --> 00:47:45,572
I am honestly disappointed.

603
00:47:49,784 --> 00:47:52,996
The stalker matter will be handled
by the company.

604
00:47:53,830 --> 00:47:57,584
Please wait here until you hear
from someone in charge.

605
00:47:57,667 --> 00:47:59,544
-Director.
-Let's end this.

606
00:48:01,421 --> 00:48:05,592
I won't be seeing you in private again.

607
00:48:14,726 --> 00:48:15,685
Take care.
