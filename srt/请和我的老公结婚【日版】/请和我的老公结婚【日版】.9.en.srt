1
00:00:30,698 --> 00:00:32,575
Good morning.

2
00:00:32,658 --> 00:00:34,201
Are you okay, Ms. Kanbe?

3
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:42,585
I heard.
Hirano's turned into a stalker, huh?

4
00:00:42,668 --> 00:00:43,502
Yeah.

5
00:00:44,795 --> 00:00:47,590
I will be in charge of watching over you.

6
00:00:47,673 --> 00:00:51,552
We wouldn't want you to wander outside
and end up getting attacked by that loser.

7
00:00:51,635 --> 00:00:54,346
Did you hear from the Director?

8
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:56,682
Yeah, I had a LINE message from my brother
when I woke up

9
00:00:56,766 --> 00:00:58,142
and I flew out of bed to get here.

10
00:00:59,351 --> 00:01:01,270
Did he say anything?

11
00:01:02,313 --> 00:01:06,108
Anything? You mean
besides the stalker stuff?

12
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,281
Are you and my brother finally...

13
00:01:12,364 --> 00:01:13,824
Oh, no. That's not it.

14
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:22,541
Ms. Sumiyoshi, is everything all right?

15
00:01:24,752 --> 00:01:25,586
What?

16
00:01:27,505 --> 00:01:29,799
Yes. I can. I'll be right there.

17
00:01:29,882 --> 00:01:30,716
What?

18
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:31,884
Let's go, Miku!

19
00:01:32,468 --> 00:01:33,302
But...

20
00:01:37,348 --> 00:01:38,390
Ms. Sumiyoshi.

21
00:01:39,016 --> 00:01:41,894
What? You're already here?
What about work?

22
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:45,314
I took the day off for personal reasons.

23
00:01:45,397 --> 00:01:47,149
I'm also off on special assignment.

24
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:49,109
So...

25
00:01:49,193 --> 00:01:52,363
Is it true that the Director came
to visit you this morning?

26
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:53,572
My brother? But why?

27
00:01:55,199 --> 00:01:56,116
Oh, oh, no...

28
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,201
I heard.

29
00:01:57,284 --> 00:01:58,994
He's your brother, right?

30
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,121
It was quite the shock.

31
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:04,708
You two asked Director Suzuki
to do that for me, right?

32
00:02:08,671 --> 00:02:10,214
{\an8}MEDICAL REPORT

33
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:12,341
{\an8}<i>I have contacted the doctor.</i>

34
00:02:12,424 --> 00:02:15,010
Here is the referral letter.

35
00:02:17,096 --> 00:02:22,142
<i>He said he knew a great doctor and got me</i>
<i>in with a top specialist for my cancer.</i>

36
00:02:22,768 --> 00:02:24,061
-The Director did?
-My brother did?

37
00:02:25,104 --> 00:02:28,774
Thanks to him, I can transfer
to another hospital for surgery.

38
00:02:28,858 --> 00:02:29,942
Surgery?

39
00:02:31,277 --> 00:02:33,320
You mean it's operable?

40
00:02:33,946 --> 00:02:35,573
<i>I wish I didn't have to say this,</i>

41
00:02:36,615 --> 00:02:40,744
but the cancer has spread
to other organs and lymph nodes.

42
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:45,165
It would be difficult
to remove it completely with surgery.

43
00:02:47,793 --> 00:02:52,673
So, does that mean it's too late?

44
00:02:53,215 --> 00:02:55,134
The doctor really gave me a scare.

45
00:02:56,427 --> 00:02:59,722
Said if we'd caught it even a little
later, it would've been too late.

46
00:03:02,725 --> 00:03:05,436
Hard to believe my husband's cheating
actually helped me.

47
00:03:06,562 --> 00:03:09,815
Well, it may take a little time,

48
00:03:09,899 --> 00:03:12,985
but I'll get the bad part cut out
and make my comeback.

49
00:03:14,278 --> 00:03:15,362
Just wait and see.

50
00:03:18,616 --> 00:03:19,575
That's great.

51
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:24,496
I'm so happy for you...

52
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:29,418
Come on, now. This is too much.

53
00:03:30,628 --> 00:03:32,796
But... I'm sorry...

54
00:03:34,632 --> 00:03:35,841
I'm so glad.

55
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:40,554
-Well, that's great for Ms. Sumiyoshi.
-Yeah.

56
00:03:41,096 --> 00:03:42,932
But I'm a bit surprised.

57
00:03:43,015 --> 00:03:45,768
I can't believe my brother
actually came to the hospital.

58
00:03:58,822 --> 00:04:01,700
<i>The number you have dialed</i>
<i>cannot be reached.</i>

59
00:04:03,369 --> 00:04:04,620
-Miku.
-Huh?

60
00:04:04,703 --> 00:04:06,163
Can you reach the Director?

61
00:04:06,705 --> 00:04:08,374
No one can get a hold of him.

62
00:04:08,457 --> 00:04:11,126
My father said he hasn't
come into work either.

63
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:17,633
Anyway, let's get you back somewhere safe.

64
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:18,634
-Okay.
-Okay.

65
00:04:24,723 --> 00:04:27,017
Yuto, what's going on?

66
00:04:29,979 --> 00:04:32,147
Huh? My brother?

67
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:52,418
<i>Late last night, Mr. Suzuki contacted me.</i>

68
00:04:56,922 --> 00:04:58,757
<i>I met him at my cafe this morning.</i>

69
00:05:00,384 --> 00:05:04,680
I'd like you to keep a close eye
on Reina Esaka's behavior from now on.

70
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:06,515
Ms. Esaka?

71
00:05:07,141 --> 00:05:09,643
Yes. And also...

72
00:05:13,397 --> 00:05:14,606
I want you to keep this for me.

73
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:17,609
If anything happens to me,

74
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,655
please use it for Ms. Kanbe.

75
00:05:22,948 --> 00:05:26,035
I promised not to open it
unless it was an emergency,

76
00:05:26,118 --> 00:05:27,411
but I got so worried...

77
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,247
I thought you might be in trouble, so...

78
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,498
-You opened it?
-You opened it?

79
00:05:32,124 --> 00:05:34,126
Yes, I opened it.

80
00:05:35,127 --> 00:05:36,503

What could Mr. Suzuki
possibly be thinking?

87
00:05:54,313 --> 00:05:57,274
Seriously, where on earth did he go?

104
00:08:04,568 --> 00:08:06,278
It was good to see you last night.

105
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:07,779
<i>What do you want?!</i>

106
00:08:07,863 --> 00:08:10,032
I hear you missed work again today.

107
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:12,826
That's a full week
of unexcused absences now.

108
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:15,287
<i>Keep this up and you'll be fired.</i>

109
00:08:16,038 --> 00:08:17,039
Shut up!

110
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:19,666
I can quit your stupid company
anytime I want!

111
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,793
<i>What are you going to do after you quit?</i>

112
00:08:22,628 --> 00:08:25,005
<i>You've racked up</i>
<i>quite a bit of debt, haven't you?</i>

113
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:26,673
You are still young.

114
00:08:27,633 --> 00:08:29,760
This path you're on
leads to nothing but failure.

115
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:31,345
It's none of your business!

116
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:32,971
I'll kill you!

117
00:08:35,057 --> 00:08:36,266
<i>I want to make a deal.</i>

118
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:37,643
Huh?

119
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:39,436
I'd like to make amends.

120
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:44,441
I will compensate you
for the emotional distress you've incurred

121
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:48,070
<i>and your situation in the company</i>
<i>will be made as favorable as possible.</i>

122
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:51,365
You think money can fix this?

123
00:08:51,949 --> 00:08:53,784
Right now, I'm in Toyama.

<i>Toyama?</i>

125
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:58,247
Why are you in Misa's hometown?
Is Misa with you?

126
00:08:59,081 --> 00:09:01,416
Would you be willing
to talk it over with me?

127
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:05,545
<i>I'd like to offer you</i>
<i>a fresh start in life.</i>

128
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:11,927
Who were you talking to?

129
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:21,603
What are you planning to do?

130
00:09:21,687 --> 00:09:23,313
It's just for self-defense.

131
00:09:23,397 --> 00:09:25,274
Are you going to see Misa?

132
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:27,776
Hey, where are you going?

133
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:28,735
Toyama.

134
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:32,155
Toyama...

135
00:09:38,954 --> 00:09:41,290
Seriously, where did he go?

136
00:09:46,712 --> 00:09:48,588
Sorry, Kamekichi, I need to get in here.

137
00:09:54,886 --> 00:09:56,638

00:09:59,891 --> 00:10:02,728
I believe it's synced to his calendar.

140

Let me handle this.

141
00:10:11,862 --> 00:10:13,780

Mother, did you know?

171
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:37,859
Toyama is a very cold place.

172
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:45,033
My great-uncle's house
would get these awful drafts,

173
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:48,495
and it never warmed up,
even with the stove burning.

00:14:17,691 --> 00:14:18,984
boring.

181
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:27,492
Mother? Mother! What a relief!

182
00:14:27,576 --> 00:14:30,579
I was bored out of my mind
with you asleep like that.

183
00:14:31,663 --> 00:14:36,084
I bought some delicious
apples to eat with you.

184
00:14:37,335 --> 00:14:38,211
You...

185
00:14:42,507 --> 00:14:44,092
to me...

186
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:46,428
What?

187
00:14:51,975 --> 00:14:53,226
Lied...

188
00:14:55,854 --> 00:14:57,147
Horrible!

189
00:14:58,189 --> 00:14:59,232
Lie!

190
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:06,072
You mean about the baby?

191
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:09,784
I've got plenty of time
to pop out as many kids as I want.

192
00:15:09,868 --> 00:15:13,997
Well, if Tomoya has the money
to support them, that is.

193
00:15:14,706 --> 00:15:15,707
Monster!

194
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:22,005
Are you referring to me?

195
00:15:24,049 --> 00:15:30,096
Mother, the real monster isn't me, it's...

196
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:33,475
You... wicked... woman.

197
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:37,937
It's... your... fault!

198
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:39,481
Shut up!

199
00:15:41,733 --> 00:15:44,069
Stop talking like that!

200
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:49,866
Why are you being so mean?

201
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,994
Didn't you say you
always wanted a daughter?

202
00:15:53,078 --> 00:15:59,084
Mother, let's go shopping together again,
arm in arm, in Ginza, what do you say?

203
00:15:59,167 --> 00:16:00,752
Get... out!

204
00:16:03,254 --> 00:16:06,132
Stay... away...

205
00:16:07,717 --> 00:16:11,638
from... Tomo!

206
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:21,064
I knew you were only after the baby.

207
00:16:37,038 --> 00:16:38,581
I knew that.

208
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:46,923
But it still... makes me sad, Mother.

209
00:16:47,757 --> 00:16:54,681
I... am... not... your...

210
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:57,767
fucking mother!

211
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:10,405
8 MISSED CALLS MIKU SUZUKI

212

{\an8}TOMOYA HIRANO
There's a taxi waiting at the station.

213
00:17:13,408 --> 00:17:15,744
{\an8}Please get in.
The driver knows where to go.

214
00:17:42,103 --> 00:17:46,524
KANBE FAMILY

215
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:55,992
It's been a long time, sir.

216
00:17:57,202 --> 00:17:58,870
Thanks to you,

217
00:17:59,621 --> 00:18:02,499
I was able to meet her. Misa is fine.

218
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:07,170
She got rid of her husband and that woman,

219
00:18:08,713 --> 00:18:10,548
and she has made some friends.

220
00:18:12,133 --> 00:18:14,260
She seems to be having
a good time at work, too.

221
00:18:16,471 --> 00:18:20,308
So... please don't worry.

222
00:18:21,935 --> 00:18:24,395
In your daughter's second life...

223
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:28,942
I will always be there to protect her.

224
00:18:43,581 --> 00:18:45,250
Thank you for coming all this way.

225
00:18:46,543 --> 00:18:47,669
Where's Misa?

226
00:18:47,752 --> 00:18:50,213
She's somewhere else. I'll drive us there.

227
00:18:58,304 --> 00:19:00,598
Why do I have to go on a drive with you?

228
00:19:00,682 --> 00:19:02,308
Where's Misa?

229
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:03,726
Hey.

230
00:19:04,269 --> 00:19:05,228
Hey.

231
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:06,855
Answer me!

232
00:19:12,026 --> 00:19:13,236
Tell me...

233
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:16,865
what did Misa say about me?

234
00:19:18,032 --> 00:19:19,242
Please get in.

235
00:19:37,218 --> 00:19:38,970
What are you planning to tell me?

236
00:19:39,053 --> 00:19:40,305
You'll find out soon.

237
00:19:41,055 --> 00:19:44,183
Let me be clear, even if Misa apologizes,
I'll never forgive her.

238
00:19:44,267 --> 00:19:46,185
Not after she betrayed me like that.

239
00:19:46,269 --> 00:19:48,479
Is she really the traitor here?

240
00:19:48,563 --> 00:19:49,564
Huh?

241
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:53,568
She's the one who tricked me
with her constant lies.

242
00:20:01,284 --> 00:20:06,039
As long as it serves to make you happy,
the suffering of others means nothing.

243
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:07,624
Have you ever felt that way?

244
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:09,834
You'd have to be absolute
scum to think that.

245
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:13,254
Then I think you might
actually be on board.

246
00:20:13,338 --> 00:20:15,423
-Huh?
-My answer would be yes.

247
00:20:16,466 --> 00:20:18,801
As long as the one I love is happy,

248
00:20:19,594 --> 00:20:22,096
no amount of suffering
on your part matters.

249
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:26,392
If someone killed the one I love,

250
00:20:28,311 --> 00:20:31,064
I'd kill them without a second thought.

251
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:34,442
Hey.

252
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:09,686
Ms. Kanbe!

253
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:11,980
Are you okay?

254
00:21:20,655 --> 00:21:21,739
Misa.

255
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:28,121
Please get in the car. Now!

256
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:36,504
Drive.

257
00:21:46,264 --> 00:21:48,808
Misa? Where are you going?

258
00:21:50,977 --> 00:21:52,687
What am I going to do?

259
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:56,024
Misa!

260
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:34,687
What...

261
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,150
in the hell do you think you're doing?

262
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:45,907
What are you doing?

263
00:22:50,495 --> 00:22:52,830
If you won't answer,
I'll change my question.

264
00:22:56,751 --> 00:22:57,877
Director,

265
00:23:00,088 --> 00:23:01,547
you've died before, haven't you?

266
00:23:04,342 --> 00:23:06,469

TOGA BRIDGE CAR ACCIDENT
RETURN TO 2015

272
00:23:22,902 --> 00:23:26,781
You got into an accident
back there in 2025.

273
00:23:59,105 --> 00:24:01,190
In my first life,

274
00:24:03,025 --> 00:24:04,944
I had every chance to do it.

275
00:24:06,154 --> 00:24:07,864
I'll be back after first period.

276
00:24:10,575 --> 00:24:12,535
Come on! That way!

277
00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:14,871
<i>If I had talked to you that time...</i>

278
00:24:15,955 --> 00:24:17,665
Oh, I'm sorry. Sorry.

279
00:24:18,541 --> 00:24:19,375
Oh, sorry.

280
00:24:19,917 --> 00:24:21,377
Sorry to keep you waiting!

281
00:24:22,962 --> 00:24:24,130
<i>Or that time...</i>

282
00:24:29,594 --> 00:24:30,678
<i>Or that time...</i>

283
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:33,806
-Thank you.
-Thank you so much.

284
00:24:34,891 --> 00:24:38,811
<i>I could have done it any time.</i>
<i>But I never did.</i>

285
00:24:41,522 --> 00:24:43,107
And then you died.

286
00:24:47,195 --> 00:24:50,865
One... more... time...

287
00:25:01,918 --> 00:25:03,794
If I could do it over...

288
00:25:06,714 --> 00:25:08,299
one more time...

289
00:25:22,605 --> 00:25:24,774
Why did you come to Toyama?

290
00:25:27,151 --> 00:25:30,988
I wanted to lay you to rest
where you felt safe.

291
00:25:32,823 --> 00:25:34,659
Next to your father.

292
00:25:43,626 --> 00:25:45,211
Are we done?

293
00:25:46,128 --> 00:25:48,172
I'm sure your questions
have been answered.

294
00:25:48,256 --> 00:25:49,757
Please go back to Tokyo.

295
00:25:50,633 --> 00:25:51,842
What are you saying?

296
00:25:52,385 --> 00:25:55,304
Ms. Sumiyoshi will be saved
if the operation is successful.

297
00:25:56,847 --> 00:25:57,723
But...

298
00:26:00,309 --> 00:26:04,313
what happens, happens,
unless there's a substitute.

299
00:26:07,358 --> 00:26:10,778
You would live in fear of your fate
for the rest of your life.

300
00:26:12,822 --> 00:26:15,700
So you tried to die with Tomoya?

301
00:26:17,118 --> 00:26:18,869
You were going to do it, weren't you?

302
00:26:19,412 --> 00:26:21,580
With Tomoya as a substitute for my death.

303
00:26:23,749 --> 00:26:25,584
That would have set you free.

304
00:26:25,668 --> 00:26:27,295
Please, enough is enough!

305
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,338
I don't want that.

306
00:26:29,422 --> 00:26:33,134
If things stay like this,
your second life will end up the same.

307
00:26:35,011 --> 00:26:36,804
You can't beat them.

308
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:41,183
You're not the kind of person
who can become a villain.

309
00:26:46,522 --> 00:26:47,606
So I will.

310
00:26:50,568 --> 00:26:52,320
Please stop with the hero act.

311
00:26:54,697 --> 00:26:57,742
I didn't ask for this.
I really didn't ask for this!

312
00:27:07,877 --> 00:27:09,420
I always thought of you.

313
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:13,591
But...

314
00:27:14,592 --> 00:27:18,220
I couldn't play a part in your life story.

315
00:27:19,513 --> 00:27:21,432
I regretted it,

316
00:27:23,142 --> 00:27:24,560
so I came back.

317
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:30,274
In your father's taxi.

318
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:36,238
I came back to see you.

319
00:27:54,006 --> 00:27:54,840
Huh?

320
00:27:55,341 --> 00:27:56,467
Are you okay?

321
00:27:59,345 --> 00:28:00,179
Yes.

322
00:28:00,805 --> 00:28:02,431
Well, I'm glad I picked you up.

323
00:28:03,516 --> 00:28:05,142
It was fate.

324
00:28:06,435 --> 00:28:07,812
Are you in a hurry?

325
00:28:07,895 --> 00:28:09,230
Uh, no.

326
00:28:10,022 --> 00:28:13,150
I know the best route,
so please leave it to me.

327
00:28:14,318 --> 00:28:15,361
Thank you so much.

328
00:28:15,444 --> 00:28:16,904
Nah, no problem at all!

329
00:28:19,573 --> 00:28:20,408
Sorry...

330
00:28:22,493 --> 00:28:24,036
Did I die?

331
00:28:26,872 --> 00:28:30,376
This taxi can take you anywhere.

332
00:28:31,001 --> 00:28:32,795
Where do you want to go?

333
00:28:34,964 --> 00:28:35,881
Heaven?

334
00:28:37,341 --> 00:28:41,512
Or do you have any regrets?

335
00:28:46,642 --> 00:28:50,688
I have... many regrets.

336
00:28:52,773 --> 00:28:53,774
What kind?

337
00:28:56,318 --> 00:28:59,071
I was slow to realize
what was important...

338
00:29:00,322 --> 00:29:02,366
and failed to protect it.

339
00:29:04,076 --> 00:29:08,330
In that case,
don't take the wrong path this time.

340
00:29:09,331 --> 00:29:10,207
What?

341
00:29:11,208 --> 00:29:12,751
Here, hold out your hands.

342
00:29:12,835 --> 00:29:13,669
Huh?

343
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:14,753
Here.

344
00:29:22,636 --> 00:29:24,013
Three o'clock snacks.

345
00:29:27,516 --> 00:29:30,561
Driver, I met you back at the university.

346
00:29:31,812 --> 00:29:32,855
Ms. Kanbe's...

347
00:29:32,938 --> 00:29:38,944
Thanks for actually
coming to visit Toyama.

348
00:29:41,363 --> 00:29:44,533
Now it's my turn to show you the way.

349
00:29:44,617 --> 00:29:47,995
Now, hold on tight.

350
00:30:07,932 --> 00:30:08,807
Huh?

351
00:30:22,571 --> 00:30:23,864
Tokyo?

352
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:37,878

Sorry!

357
00:31:44,945 --> 00:31:47,865
My dream came true.

358
00:32:00,002 --> 00:32:05,716
In my second life... I have no regrets.

359
00:32:15,893 --> 00:32:17,853
You don't understand a thing.

360
00:32:21,732 --> 00:32:23,108
I didn't ask for this.

361
00:32:24,443 --> 00:32:25,694
Because...

362
00:32:27,613 --> 00:32:29,865
in my second life...

363
00:32:31,533 --> 00:32:33,285
I need you.

364
00:32:37,247 --> 00:32:40,584
I don't want to be helped,
I don't want to be protected,

365
00:32:42,211 --> 00:32:44,254
I want to spend my life with you.

366
00:32:47,174 --> 00:32:50,219
There has to be some way
to make it work. I'm sure of it.

367
00:32:50,803 --> 00:32:52,930
I won't let those two destroy me.

368
00:32:53,847 --> 00:32:56,684
Fate's cruel and life's hard,
but we can change it!

369
00:32:56,767 --> 00:32:58,268
Let's believe that!

370
00:33:00,896 --> 00:33:02,147
Because...

371
00:33:03,399 --> 00:33:05,651
that's exactly what you taught me.

372
00:33:17,705 --> 00:33:19,123
Remember when you were little,

373
00:33:20,666 --> 00:33:24,086
and you put a sweet treat in your mouth,
how easy it was to believe?

374
00:33:27,464 --> 00:33:29,633
That we were happy.

375
00:33:35,931 --> 00:33:38,559
I love you.

376
00:33:51,155 --> 00:33:53,407
Let's live together.

377
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,197
So cold.

378
00:34:39,203 --> 00:34:41,413
Where even is this?

379
00:34:48,003 --> 00:34:50,714
Damn it.

380
00:34:52,966 --> 00:34:54,843
Anybody!

381
00:34:55,886 --> 00:34:58,388
Anybody here?

382
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:02,351
Answer me!

383
00:35:07,815 --> 00:35:09,733
Anybody?

384
00:35:10,359 --> 00:35:12,820
Answer me, damn it!

385
00:35:14,822 --> 00:35:19,868
<i>The bamboo of the kokiriko is</i>

386
00:35:19,952 --> 00:35:24,748
<i>Seven sun and five bu long</i>

387
00:35:24,832 --> 00:35:29,837
<i>Were it any longer</i>

388
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:34,424
<i>Your sleeve would catch the end</i>

389
00:35:35,467 --> 00:35:39,847
<i>Dance at the window side, dederekoden</i>

390
00:35:40,514 --> 00:35:44,560
<i>Hail to the festival, dederekoden</i>

391
00:35:45,811 --> 00:35:51,400
<i>Dance if you fancy, dance, dance away</i>

392
00:35:51,483 --> 00:35:56,113
<i>Leave us the little ones</i>

393
00:35:56,780 --> 00:36:01,785
<i>The sasara sits</i>

394
00:36:01,869 --> 00:36:05,455
<i>On the windowsill</i>

395
00:36:06,081 --> 00:36:08,500
Wrinkly school bag!

396
00:36:19,678 --> 00:36:23,724
We're the only ones in our class
with hand-me-down school bags.

397
00:36:25,934 --> 00:36:29,980
But that means our bags match.
I'm so happy.

398
00:36:32,774 --> 00:36:37,779
My father saved the money
for my school bag,

399
00:36:38,363 --> 00:36:40,741
but my mother spent it all.

400
00:36:41,575 --> 00:36:44,661
I have one, a new school bag.

401
00:36:44,745 --> 00:36:45,913
You do?

402
00:36:46,705 --> 00:36:50,375
My mom and dad bought me
a shiny new school bag,

403
00:36:51,001 --> 00:36:54,963
but there was a poor kid in my class.
I felt sorry for them, so we traded.

404
00:36:55,422 --> 00:36:58,550
Wow, Reina, you're so nice.

405
00:37:04,681 --> 00:37:06,058
That's my mom.

406
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:12,105
Wow, Reina, your mom is so pretty!

407
00:37:17,819 --> 00:37:20,322
My mom is so kind.

408
00:37:20,948 --> 00:37:24,826
Really? I'm jealous.

409
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:28,205
My dad works for a TV station in Tokyo.

410
00:37:28,288 --> 00:37:30,248
But I don't miss him at all.

411
00:37:30,832 --> 00:37:34,670
He calls me every day
and sends me lots of presents.

412
00:37:34,753 --> 00:37:37,673
Oh, that's nice.

413
00:37:37,756 --> 00:37:40,300
Reina, that's so nice.

414
00:37:40,842 --> 00:37:41,677
Misa.

415
00:37:42,177 --> 00:37:43,553
Oh, Dad!

416
00:37:44,304 --> 00:37:45,263
Let's get on home.

417
00:37:45,347 --> 00:37:47,975
-It's already time for dinner.
-Okay. Sorry.

418
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:51,269
Okay, Reina, see you tomorrow.

419
00:37:51,353 --> 00:37:52,270
Is that your friend?

420
00:37:52,354 --> 00:37:53,689
-Yeah!
-I see.

421
00:37:53,772 --> 00:37:55,273
What's for dinner?

422
00:37:55,357 --> 00:37:57,234
It's Dad's specialty, buri-daikon!

423
00:37:57,317 --> 00:37:58,777
Oh, yay!

424
00:37:59,236 --> 00:38:00,988
Better do your homework before dinner!

425
00:38:01,071 --> 00:38:01,905
Okay.

426
00:38:01,989 --> 00:38:03,448
You're a good kid, Misa.

427
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:05,993
Your dad's a happy man!

428
00:38:06,868 --> 00:38:07,703
Here!

429
00:38:07,786 --> 00:38:08,912
Oh, it's a frog!

430
00:38:41,361 --> 00:38:45,032
I used to come here a lot
for walks with my dad.

431
00:38:46,825 --> 00:38:47,993
Um...

432
00:38:49,453 --> 00:38:51,329
It's a little hard to walk like this.

433
00:38:51,955 --> 00:38:53,582
I'm holding you down.

434
00:38:53,665 --> 00:38:56,543
So you don't fly off
and do something stupid again.

435
00:38:59,504 --> 00:39:01,423
You also met my grandmother, didn't you?

436
00:39:01,506 --> 00:39:03,759
Without saying anything to me.

437
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:07,095
You're such a liar.

438
00:39:11,933 --> 00:39:14,394
You said you had
no more feelings for me...

439
00:39:15,687 --> 00:39:16,772
That you'd end it.

440
00:39:16,855 --> 00:39:19,191
That you won't see me anymore.
Take all that back.

441
00:39:31,244 --> 00:39:35,373
I'm sorry that I said such
horrible things to you.

442
00:39:38,335 --> 00:39:41,838
So, what are your true feelings for me?

443
00:39:44,341 --> 00:39:46,384
Shouldn't you know that by now?

444
00:39:46,468 --> 00:39:48,929
I want you to put it in words.
I told you how I feel.

445
00:39:49,721 --> 00:39:51,890
We're not college students
anymore, come on.

446
00:39:51,973 --> 00:39:52,891
What?

447
00:39:52,974 --> 00:39:54,601
Oh, is that what it is?

448
00:39:54,684 --> 00:39:56,895
It's because you know
I'm actually 37 years old,

449
00:39:56,978 --> 00:39:59,231
and you think I'm too old at 37?

450
00:39:59,314 --> 00:40:01,108
Huh, is that what it is?

451
00:40:17,624 --> 00:40:18,625
I...

452
00:40:21,711 --> 00:40:23,296
love...

453
00:40:35,517 --> 00:40:36,518
Hello?

454
00:40:36,601 --> 00:40:39,020
<i>I got your voicemail!</i>
<i>You met up with my brother, right?</i>

455
00:40:40,021 --> 00:40:43,275
Yeah. I have a tight grip on him now.

456
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:44,734
There's no need to worry.

457
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,320
<i>Is Reina with you?</i>

458
00:40:48,488 --> 00:40:49,322
Huh?

459
00:40:51,575 --> 00:40:54,119
It's on Reina's Instagram.

460
00:40:54,911 --> 00:40:55,745
Instagram?

461
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:13,889
{\an8}It's been a while.
#MemoriesWithMyBestFriend #Toyama

462
00:41:23,815 --> 00:41:25,609
It's cold, isn't it?

463
00:41:26,359 --> 00:41:28,320
But you'll just have
to tough it out, okay?

464
00:41:29,112 --> 00:41:32,991
Your grandchild has made my heart
colder than a Toyama winter.

465
00:41:34,326 --> 00:41:36,286
Where are we going?

466
00:41:38,121 --> 00:41:40,332
Your grandchild is terrible.

467
00:41:40,916 --> 00:41:45,003
I've been nothing but kind to her
since she was a little girl,

468
00:41:45,086 --> 00:41:47,172
but she bullies me.

469
00:41:48,381 --> 00:41:52,636
She is a self-centered, lying coward

470
00:41:53,345 --> 00:41:55,680
that tore my heart to shreds.

471
00:41:58,558 --> 00:42:00,435
And she does it all with a happy smile.

472
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:16,243
That's not the kind of thing we can
just forgive people for, don't you agree?

473
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:27,837
Did you find her?

474
00:42:27,921 --> 00:42:28,922
No, she's not here.

475
00:42:29,798 --> 00:42:31,049
We'll go this way.

476
00:42:37,264 --> 00:42:38,306
Kikue!

477
00:42:38,765 --> 00:42:39,808
Grandma!

478
00:42:41,184 --> 00:42:42,727
-Grandma!
-Kikue!

479
00:42:42,811 --> 00:42:43,937
Grandma!

480
00:42:44,604 --> 00:42:45,647
Kikue!

481
00:42:46,856 --> 00:42:47,983
Kikue!

482
00:42:48,817 --> 00:42:50,193
Grandma!

483
00:42:50,277 --> 00:42:51,987
Grandma!

484
00:42:55,156 --> 00:42:56,074
Kikue!

485
00:42:56,157 --> 00:42:57,826
Grandma!

486
00:42:57,909 --> 00:43:00,912
-Where are you, Grandma?
-Kikue!

487
00:43:00,996 --> 00:43:02,580
Grandma!

488
00:43:06,334 --> 00:43:08,336
Please wait here.

489
00:43:15,176 --> 00:43:16,011
Misa!

490
00:43:23,852 --> 00:43:27,063
Ms. Kanbe? Ms. Kanbe!

491
00:43:29,899 --> 00:43:31,568
Grandma!

492
00:43:33,486 --> 00:43:35,155
Where are you, Grandma?

493
00:43:36,948 --> 00:43:38,491
Grandma!

494
00:43:40,577 --> 00:43:42,078
She's gone.

495
00:43:46,708 --> 00:43:49,586
Misa! I finally found you!

496
00:43:50,170 --> 00:43:51,087
Reina...

497
00:43:53,548 --> 00:43:55,300
Where's my grandma?

498
00:43:55,383 --> 00:43:57,510
What did you do to her?

499
00:43:57,594 --> 00:43:59,637
Why are you doing this?

500
00:43:59,721 --> 00:44:01,598
"Why are you doing this?"

501
00:44:01,681 --> 00:44:03,308
What a stupid question.

502
00:44:03,391 --> 00:44:05,560
Grandma has nothing to do with this!

503
00:44:06,895 --> 00:44:09,189
When your dad died,

504
00:44:09,856 --> 00:44:11,524
I was so happy.

505
00:44:12,817 --> 00:44:16,863
I wanted to savor that same feeling
one more time.

506
00:44:18,198 --> 00:44:20,867
I approached you in the second grade

507
00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:22,827
because you looked miserable.

508
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:26,581
I thought you were just like me.

509
00:44:28,541 --> 00:44:30,335
But you weren't at all.

510
00:44:31,586 --> 00:44:34,756
You were so blessed, and still,

511
00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:36,966
you acted like you were all alone.

512
00:44:37,050 --> 00:44:39,719
Like you were the most miserable person
in the world.

513
00:44:43,973 --> 00:44:46,559
I hated the way you
always played the victim...

514
00:44:47,268 --> 00:44:49,979
from the bottom of my heart.

515
00:44:53,650 --> 00:44:55,193
Where's Grandma?

516
00:45:15,422 --> 00:45:19,175
What part of you is all alone?!

517
00:45:20,385 --> 00:45:21,719
Ms. Kanbe!

518
00:45:22,595 --> 00:45:23,847
Ms. Kanbe!

519
00:45:30,395 --> 00:45:32,647
Kikue! Are you okay?

520
00:45:37,235 --> 00:45:39,737
-Kikue!
-Kikue!

521
00:45:39,821 --> 00:45:41,281
Over here!

522
00:45:41,865 --> 00:45:42,907
Over there!

523
00:45:48,913 --> 00:45:53,585
How do you think I felt, listening
to all of your bitching and moaning?

524
00:45:54,919 --> 00:46:00,341
Your mother left you for a man?
Your father died? You have no friends?

525
00:46:00,425 --> 00:46:02,177
Work is hard?

526
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:06,055
I was much lonelier
and had it much harder than you!

527
00:46:06,890 --> 00:46:09,976
But you were so wrapped up
in your own problems,

528
00:46:10,059 --> 00:46:13,938
you couldn't spare
a single thought for my feelings!

529
00:46:29,996 --> 00:46:33,625
If you hate me so much,
why are you so obsessed with me?

530
00:46:34,209 --> 00:46:35,251
Shut up!

531
00:46:38,713 --> 00:46:42,175
I'm trying. I'm trying all the time.

532
00:46:42,258 --> 00:46:45,220
I'm trying to be liked and loved.

533
00:46:45,303 --> 00:46:47,555
But all I ever attract is human garbage

534
00:46:47,639 --> 00:46:50,767
while two-faced bitches
like you get all the love,

535
00:46:51,768 --> 00:46:54,562
and everyone leaves me!

536
00:47:00,652 --> 00:47:01,945
Ms. Kanbe!

537
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:04,906
Ms. Kanbe!

538
00:47:12,372 --> 00:47:14,165
You lucked out.

539
00:47:14,958 --> 00:47:21,089
After your kind father,
you get a prince to protect you on demand.

540
00:47:28,054 --> 00:47:31,140
That's the way it's always been for you.

541
00:47:59,961 --> 00:48:01,087
Ms. Kanbe!

542
00:48:02,797 --> 00:48:03,798
Ms. Kanbe!

543
00:48:04,507 --> 00:48:05,508
Ms. Kanbe.

544
00:48:51,763 --> 00:48:52,805
Welcome.

546
00:49:27,757 --> 00:49:29,467

547
00:49:29,550 --> 00:49:31,928
DAD - 22 MISSED CALLS
CALL - SMS

548
00:49:36,349 --> 00:49:39,602
Dad? Did something happen with Mom?

549
00:49:40,228 --> 00:49:42,522
<i>Tomoya, Mom is conscious again.</i>

550
00:49:42,605 --> 00:49:44,691
Oh, really?

551
00:49:45,316 --> 00:49:46,150
<i>But...</i>

552
00:49:46,776 --> 00:49:47,610
But?

553
00:49:48,361 --> 00:49:50,988
She fell from the bed and broke her nose.

554
00:49:51,698 --> 00:49:52,532
<i>What?</i>

555
00:49:54,367 --> 00:49:56,119
She wants to talk to you in private.

556
00:49:56,828 --> 00:49:59,163
I'll go change the water in the vase.

557
00:50:06,254 --> 00:50:07,380
<i>Mom?</i>

558
00:50:07,463 --> 00:50:08,631
Tomo.

559
00:50:09,674 --> 00:50:14,011
Thank God you're conscious.
Is your nose okay?

560
00:50:14,095 --> 00:50:15,513
<i>That wife of yours...</i>

561
00:50:16,556 --> 00:50:17,515
Huh?

562
00:50:17,598 --> 00:50:19,100
She hit me.

563
00:50:20,643 --> 00:50:21,519
Huh?

564
00:50:22,061 --> 00:50:25,106
<i>Your wife hit me.</i>

565
00:50:26,858 --> 00:50:29,110
You mean Reina hit you?

566
00:50:29,944 --> 00:50:30,903
Yeah.

567
00:50:32,655 --> 00:50:34,198
Why would she...

568
00:50:34,282 --> 00:50:35,491
That's absurd.

569
00:50:35,575 --> 00:50:38,828
<i>It's her fault.</i>

570
00:50:40,705 --> 00:50:42,582
Don't be fooled.

571
00:50:43,458 --> 00:50:47,044
Your wife... it's all her fault.

572
00:50:51,174 --> 00:50:52,633
That's right.

573
00:50:53,968 --> 00:50:57,180
If she hadn't lied about being pregnant
in the first place,

574
00:50:57,263 --> 00:50:59,390
I never would have gotten married.

575
00:50:59,474 --> 00:51:01,225
I wouldn't have lost Misa.

576
00:51:01,309 --> 00:51:03,186
I wouldn't have almost died in Toyama.

577
00:51:06,647 --> 00:51:08,316
I can't take this anymore.

578
00:51:10,318 --> 00:51:12,487
I don't want to live like this anymore.

579
00:51:13,321 --> 00:51:16,616
Tomo, poor boy.

580
00:51:16,699 --> 00:51:17,867
<i>Mom,</i>

581
00:51:17,950 --> 00:51:19,577
I don't want this anymore.

582
00:51:20,620 --> 00:51:22,455
Help me!

583
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:24,665
<i>It's okay.</i>

584
00:51:25,625 --> 00:51:28,669
We can get it all back.

585
00:51:29,337 --> 00:51:30,171
What?

586
00:51:31,422 --> 00:51:33,341
<i>Insurance.</i>

587
00:51:34,967 --> 00:51:36,177
Insurance?

588
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:42,725
That woman should die.

589
00:52:03,746 --> 00:52:06,749
I had no idea that
you were also in Toyama.

590
00:52:07,333 --> 00:52:09,919
I was worried when I heard
you weren't at the hospital.

591
00:52:12,922 --> 00:52:16,843
You said you were going to Toyama, right?

592
00:52:17,802 --> 00:52:21,430
When I heard that, it made me miss
my hometown enough to go visit.

593
00:52:25,893 --> 00:52:28,229
I haven't told anyone about Mom.

594
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:32,149
Everyone thinks she fell from her bed
and hurt herself.

595
00:52:32,733 --> 00:52:33,860
Don't worry.

596
00:52:35,069 --> 00:52:38,531
If we make a big deal out of it,
it'll just embarrass our family.

597
00:52:39,490 --> 00:52:41,617
Mom said something mean
to you again anyway, right?

598
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:47,874
I'm on your side, Reina.

599
00:52:49,667 --> 00:52:52,837
Listen, when things settle down,
why don't we go on a trip?

600
00:52:54,839 --> 00:52:56,507
What's with you all of a sudden?

601
00:52:57,258 --> 00:53:00,219
We didn't even go on our honeymoon.

602
00:53:01,470 --> 00:53:07,852
I put a lot of pressure on you,
like the debt and taking care of my mom.

603
00:53:09,228 --> 00:53:11,606
You're all I have now, Reina.

604
00:53:13,399 --> 00:53:15,276
I consider you my precious family.

605
00:53:22,074 --> 00:53:23,326
I want to start over.

606
00:53:25,453 --> 00:53:26,537
I love you.

607
00:53:32,710 --> 00:53:36,964
That's the first time
you've said it like that.

608
00:53:40,426 --> 00:53:42,511
I'll do my best.

609
00:53:44,055 --> 00:53:47,725
Let's write off all
the bad things that happened.

610
00:53:52,313 --> 00:53:53,356
Thank you.

611
00:54:40,444 --> 00:54:41,612
You sure you're okay here?

612
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:46,242
I can't face your parents right now...

613
00:54:47,201 --> 00:54:49,412
I want one night alone
to think things over.

614
00:54:49,954 --> 00:54:51,330
There's nothing to think about.

615
00:54:52,248 --> 00:54:53,582
I'll contact you soon.

616
00:54:54,166 --> 00:54:55,793
Don't make me worry too much.

617
00:55:05,302 --> 00:55:06,220
See you.

618
00:55:06,303 --> 00:55:07,138
Yeah.

619
00:55:24,447 --> 00:55:26,032
"Write off"?

620
00:55:58,189 --> 00:55:59,315
Oh, they're back!

621
00:56:00,775 --> 00:56:02,276
Hey!

622
00:56:03,319 --> 00:56:06,322
Don't make me worry like that!

623
00:56:06,864 --> 00:56:07,990
Ms. Kanbe!

624
00:56:11,911 --> 00:56:14,080
I'm so glad that you're safe.

625
00:56:14,663 --> 00:56:16,791
So, Ms. Esaka hasn't been found yet?

626
00:56:19,043 --> 00:56:21,629
The Toyama Prefectural Police
are searching for her whereabouts.

627
00:56:22,338 --> 00:56:23,672
I brought it.

628
00:56:23,756 --> 00:56:25,674
The stuff that was delivered yesterday.

629
00:56:27,885 --> 00:56:28,719
Here.

630
00:56:33,682 --> 00:56:35,726
I ordered this from an investigation firm.

631
00:56:36,268 --> 00:56:37,269
Investigation firm?

<i>Tomoya, it's bad!</i>

654
00:58:39,850 --> 00:58:41,310
Oh, Reina?

655
00:58:41,393 --> 00:58:43,395
<i>I just got to your mother's hospital.</i>

656
00:58:43,479 --> 00:58:46,357
<i>She's comatose and in critical condition.</i>

657
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:47,608
What?

658
00:58:50,319 --> 00:58:51,862
{\an8}<i>Are you already on the highway?</i>

659
00:58:51,946 --> 00:58:54,531
{\an8}Yeah. I should be there in five minutes.

660
00:58:54,615 --> 00:58:56,116
How's Mom doing?

661
00:58:56,742 --> 00:58:59,662
<i>Your mom? What are you talking about?</i>

662
00:59:02,164 --> 00:59:03,082
Huh?

663
00:59:06,502 --> 00:59:08,879
Maybe she's taking a nice, long nap.

664
00:59:10,547 --> 00:59:11,799
What's going on?

665
00:59:12,925 --> 00:59:15,427
I thought it was strange.

666
00:59:16,303 --> 00:59:21,141
I punched your beloved mommy in the face,
but you didn't say a word.

667
00:59:21,892 --> 00:59:24,853
<i>And now you're saying,</i>
<i>"I'm on Reina's side"?</i>

668
00:59:25,521 --> 00:59:29,233
The words "write off"
also stuck with me...

669
00:59:29,316 --> 00:59:34,405
There's no way to write off
a 26 million yen debt, is there?

670
00:59:35,739 --> 00:59:38,284
No, there was.

671
00:59:39,618 --> 00:59:41,453
<i>I remember now.</i>

672
00:59:41,537 --> 00:59:42,830
<i>When we got married,</i>

673
00:59:42,913 --> 00:59:47,293
your mother forced me to take out
an expensive life insurance policy.

674
00:59:48,168 --> 00:59:50,004
<i>Did your mother put you up to it?</i>

675
00:59:50,087 --> 00:59:52,589
<i>You wanted to clear your debts, right?</i>

676
00:59:52,673 --> 00:59:56,385
You were going to take me on a trip
and murder me for the insurance money.

677
00:59:57,136 --> 00:59:59,221
Don't be ridiculous.

678
00:59:59,305 --> 01:00:03,934
<i>Did you search for "perfect crime" or</i>
<i>"how to murder without getting caught"?</i>

679
01:00:05,728 --> 01:00:07,438
Nailed it, huh?!

680
01:00:07,521 --> 01:00:10,899
Like you could ever pull off
the perfect crime, you idiot!

681
01:00:10,983 --> 01:00:12,818
You're the idiot!

682
01:00:12,901 --> 01:00:15,863
You hit my mom! Damn it!

683
01:00:15,946 --> 01:00:17,948
<i>Sorry about that.</i>

684
01:00:18,032 --> 01:00:20,326
<i>Oh, and let me apologize for this, too.</i>

685
01:00:21,577 --> 01:00:27,708
Last night, a friend of mine
snuck into your garage.

686
01:00:27,791 --> 01:00:28,625
Huh?

687
01:00:28,709 --> 01:00:32,463
He gave the brakes on that car
a little tweak for you.

688
01:00:32,546 --> 01:00:33,756
Huh?!

689
01:00:38,886 --> 01:00:42,181
<i>This counts as self-defense, right?</i>

690
01:00:43,015 --> 01:00:48,479
As your surviving wife, I'll be ever
so grateful for that fat death benefit.

691
01:00:48,562 --> 01:00:50,439
Screw you!

692
01:00:50,522 --> 01:00:52,858
Well, enjoy your drive!

693
01:00:53,525 --> 01:00:55,611
You bitch! I'm going to kill you!

694
01:01:23,055 --> 01:01:24,431
Let's eat something.

695
01:01:29,061 --> 01:01:31,188
Here. Cups?

696
01:01:31,271 --> 01:01:32,106
Yeah.

697
01:01:34,233 --> 01:01:35,150
Hello?

698
01:01:35,984 --> 01:01:37,027
<i>Misa.</i>

699
01:01:38,070 --> 01:01:38,904
Tomoya?

700
01:01:41,073 --> 01:01:43,367
Is Reina with you? Where are you?

701
01:01:44,201 --> 01:01:48,122
<i>I don't know. I don't know anymore.</i>

702
01:01:49,706 --> 01:01:51,875
<i>Tomoya, did something happen?</i>

703
01:01:52,543 --> 01:01:55,295
I didn't mean to do that to you
the other day...

704
01:01:57,214 --> 01:02:02,386
But Misa... You're the one who dumped me.

705
01:02:02,469 --> 01:02:03,470
Are you drunk?

706
01:02:03,554 --> 01:02:04,847
<i>I was wrong.</i>

707
01:02:06,348 --> 01:02:08,517
I don't know where it started,

708
01:02:09,726 --> 01:02:11,687
but everything, I did everything wrong.

709
01:02:17,484 --> 01:02:18,861
I know,

710
01:02:19,486 --> 01:02:22,281
I've been a failure at everything
since I was little,

711
01:02:22,364 --> 01:02:24,533
<i>and the only one who ever praised me</i>
<i>was my mom.</i>

712
01:02:25,117 --> 01:02:28,954
But you liked me in spite of all that.

713
01:02:39,173 --> 01:02:40,382
I want to start over.

714
01:02:42,426 --> 01:02:45,846
If I could be born again
and start my life over,

715
01:02:45,929 --> 01:02:47,556
I'd like to start over with you.

716
01:02:49,391 --> 01:02:51,852
I won't do any more stupid shit.

717
01:02:51,935 --> 01:02:54,188
I won't get into debt or cheat on you.

718
01:02:55,022 --> 01:02:58,817
And I'll be really, really
nice to you, Misa.

719
01:03:04,364 --> 01:03:05,574
Misa, I'm sorry.

720
01:03:07,784 --> 01:03:08,952
I'm sorry.

721
01:03:10,996 --> 01:03:14,208
Next time, I'll do it... I promise...

722
01:03:15,709 --> 01:03:17,836
<i>I'll make you happy!</i>
