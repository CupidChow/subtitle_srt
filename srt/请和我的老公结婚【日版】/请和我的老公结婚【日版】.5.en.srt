00:00:15,516 --> 00:00:18,060
<i>I didn't get what I wanted in life.</i>

2
00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:28,654
Order whatever you want.

3
00:00:39,457 --> 00:00:40,291
This one!

4
00:00:41,125 --> 00:00:43,169
Really? Why that one?

5
00:00:43,252 --> 00:00:44,253
HOJICHA SET 350 YEN

6
00:00:44,336 --> 00:00:48,758
You can order this fruit pancake,
or chocolate banana parfait,

7
00:00:48,841 --> 00:00:50,676
or whatever you like!

8
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,428
It's my payday today.

9
00:00:56,849 --> 00:00:57,683
Excuse me.

10
00:00:58,434 --> 00:00:59,560
What can I get for you?

11
00:01:00,269 --> 00:01:03,105
-This hojicha set and a water, please.
-Yes.

12
00:01:03,189 --> 00:01:06,025
<i>-Life was difficult for my mother and me.</i>
-Certainly.

13
00:01:06,108 --> 00:01:07,109
<i>But...</i>

14
00:01:14,658 --> 00:01:15,493
Here.

15
00:01:19,663 --> 00:01:21,165
You can have some.

16
00:01:22,166 --> 00:01:23,167
Thank you.

17
00:01:24,794 --> 00:01:25,628
Let's eat.

18
00:01:25,711 --> 00:01:26,712
Let's eat!

19
00:01:27,797 --> 00:01:30,341
<i>The moment I took a bite</i>
<i>of my sweet treat,</i>

20
00:01:30,925 --> 00:01:34,512
<i>I really believed it.</i>
<i>That my mother and I were happy.</i>

21
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:42,436
You know,

22
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:46,482
I used to work part-time at this
restaurant when I was in high school.

23
00:01:46,565 --> 00:01:50,444
It was my very first job, so I'd mess up
and get yelled at all the time.

24
00:01:50,528 --> 00:01:52,446
But there was a man from the head office

25
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:55,324
who came here for training,
and he always stood up for me.

26
00:01:56,617 --> 00:01:58,160
He was so kind.

27
00:02:00,162 --> 00:02:02,498
That man was your mom's first love.

28
00:02:03,165 --> 00:02:04,166
First love?

29
00:02:05,501 --> 00:02:07,586
I wonder when your first love will be?

30
00:02:12,675 --> 00:02:13,509
Haru?

31
00:02:17,763 --> 00:02:18,764
You remember me?

32
00:02:18,848 --> 00:02:21,892
<i>My mother and that man,</i>
<i>who were each other's first love</i>...

33
00:02:22,852 --> 00:02:23,686
<i>...met again...</i>

34
00:02:24,228 --> 00:02:25,104
This is my son.

35
00:02:25,187 --> 00:02:26,438
<i>...and fell for each other.</i>

36
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:33,320
<i>When he heard that my father</i>
<i>wanted to marry my divorced mother,</i>

37
00:02:33,946 --> 00:02:35,531
<i>Grandpa was furious.</i>

38
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:41,662
<i>My father was usually too timid</i>
<i>to go against my grandfather,</i>

39
00:02:42,538 --> 00:02:46,041
<i>but this time, he stood his ground,</i>
<i>saying he'd move out if he had to.</i>

40
00:02:47,293 --> 00:02:51,046
<i>My grandfather had no choice but to allow</i>
<i>the marriage, on the condition</i>…

41
00:02:52,548 --> 00:02:55,092
<i>that their future child would</i>
<i>take over the company.</i>

42
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:58,512
<i>It was only a few years later</i>…

43
00:02:59,972 --> 00:03:02,141
<i>that my mother fell ill.</i>

44
00:03:05,936 --> 00:03:09,064
Don't forget to be grateful
to your grandfather,

45
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:13,819
and repay his kindness in full.

46
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:19,033
And your father is too kind
to stand up for himself,

47
00:03:22,411 --> 00:03:24,496
so be there for him, okay?

48
00:03:25,998 --> 00:03:30,002
<i>That is</i>… <i>the life my mother wanted for me.</i>

49
00:03:32,671 --> 00:03:34,548
Have you decided your post-grad plans?

50
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,761
I think I'll go work
at my grandfather's company.

51
00:03:40,638 --> 00:03:42,473
You're giving up on being a researcher?

52
00:03:43,432 --> 00:03:44,808
Think hard before deciding.

53
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:47,019
It's your life.

54
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,238
TEITO UNIVERSITY

55
00:04:03,494 --> 00:04:04,703
Can I help you?

56
00:04:06,872 --> 00:04:11,168
Oh, well, I came to Tokyo
to see my daughter,

57
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:14,672
but I had some time before the meeting,

58
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:18,676
so I thought I'd drop by
to see what her school's like.

59
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:21,303
But where do I go?

60
00:04:23,222 --> 00:04:26,016
Well, this is no place
for an old man like me.

61
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,685
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

62
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:30,270
-Um...
-Huh?

63
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:33,816
If you'd like, I can show you around.

64
00:04:34,358 --> 00:04:35,734
No, no, no…

65
00:04:36,819 --> 00:04:37,653
What?

66
00:04:39,488 --> 00:04:40,322
This way.

67
00:04:40,406 --> 00:04:41,573
Are you sure?

68
00:04:47,913 --> 00:04:48,747
I'll carry those.

69
00:04:48,831 --> 00:04:50,207
Oh, no, no!

70
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,084
-Thank you.
-No problem.

71
00:04:53,335 --> 00:04:54,169
Thank you.

72
00:04:57,256 --> 00:04:59,591
Well, now, this place sure is fancy.

73
00:05:02,011 --> 00:05:04,847
And it's so nice on the inside too.

74
00:05:06,515 --> 00:05:08,267
Oh, excuse me for barging in.

75
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:11,311
This is the literature classroom.

76
00:05:11,395 --> 00:05:12,980
Oh, classroom?

77
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:20,904
Isn't this building from before the war?

78
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:24,700
Yes, though I heard
they did some renovations a few years ago.

79
00:05:24,783 --> 00:05:28,996
Renovations? Well, history goes on
no matter how we dress things up.

80
00:05:29,955 --> 00:05:33,250
Wow, there are students
all over the place out here, too!

81
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,960
This is the courtyard.

82
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:39,048
After classes, everyone meets
around here to talk and have lunch.

83
00:05:39,131 --> 00:05:42,676
I see! That's what they're all
doing out here, huh?

84
00:05:44,553 --> 00:05:45,429
This is the cafeteria.

85
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:47,014
Oh, the cafeteria!

86
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:49,475
Wow. Such a large cafeteria.

87
00:05:49,558 --> 00:05:53,270
Do they serve fish here?
My daughter likes fish.

88
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:56,398
Well, I recommend the mentai butter udon.

89
00:05:56,482 --> 00:05:58,358
-Mentai butter udon?
-Yes.

90
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:02,696
These stacked--

91
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:07,034
What are all those things
stacked up there?

92
00:06:08,577 --> 00:06:10,120
-Those, over there?
-Yes.

93
00:06:10,204 --> 00:06:12,164
Those are the thesis collections.

94
00:06:12,247 --> 00:06:13,373
-Thesis?
-Yes.

95
00:06:13,457 --> 00:06:17,086
I see. I wonder if my daughter
is writing a thesis too?

96
00:06:18,212 --> 00:06:20,422
Wow.

97
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:23,759
This is a really nice place.

98
00:06:25,469 --> 00:06:28,263
I guess there's greenery like this
in Tokyo too.

99
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:36,522
My daughter really likes
the scenery of Toyama.

100
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:43,320
Kurobe Gorge, Gokayama,
and the Jinzu Bridge.

101
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:48,200
On our days off, I would take her
all over the place in the car.

102
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:51,453
I never thought she would end up in Tokyo.

103
00:06:53,622 --> 00:06:55,541
She's a sweet girl.

104
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:58,210
I'm afraid she's too nice sometimes.

105
00:06:59,044 --> 00:07:02,005
It's just been the two of us
for a long time now, you see.

106
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:04,591
It was the same for me too.

107
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:06,593
My mother and I.

108
00:07:06,677 --> 00:07:08,095
Is that so?

109
00:07:08,804 --> 00:07:11,223
If so, your mom must be proud of you.

110
00:07:12,516 --> 00:07:16,270
No... I wasn't able to do
anything for her.

111
00:07:17,396 --> 00:07:19,815
I couldn't give my mother
the happiness she deserved.

112
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:24,319
Nah. Kids don't need
to worry about making their parents happy.

113
00:07:25,112 --> 00:07:28,157
Your happiness is your mother's happiness.

114
00:07:30,701 --> 00:07:35,038
I wanted to protect my daughter
at least until she got married,

115
00:07:35,122 --> 00:07:37,207
but things have started to fall apart.

If you're going to Jimbocho,
you can take the bus from here.

118
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:50,762
-Oh. I see. Thank you.
-You're welcome.

119
00:07:50,846 --> 00:07:52,431
And thanks for holding my bags.

120
00:07:53,432 --> 00:07:56,226
Well, thank you so much for everything.

121
00:07:57,352 --> 00:08:00,689
I always thought
Tokyo was full of shady guys,

122
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:04,026
but it's nice to know there are
decent young men like you out here.

123
00:08:06,028 --> 00:08:07,738
Oh, and please have some if you'd like.

124
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:09,281
-It's okay.
-Toyama fish cakes.

125
00:08:09,364 --> 00:08:11,074
You brought those for your daughter.

126
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:13,911
But thank you.

127
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:15,204
Really?

128
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:18,999
Well, then...

129
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:21,585
I'm sorry, this is all I have.

130
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:24,546
Give me your hand. Your hand.

131
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:26,006
Here.

132
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:28,091
Oh, right.

133
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:30,135
Do you want to see a picture?

134
00:08:31,386 --> 00:08:32,387
Let's see.

135
00:08:33,388 --> 00:08:34,389
Here.

136
00:08:35,057 --> 00:08:36,683

139
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:46,568
Come on! That way!

140
00:08:46,652 --> 00:08:49,404
Are these oranges?
Do you think they're edible?

141
00:08:50,614 --> 00:08:52,407
She's pretty, yeah?

142
00:08:57,913 --> 00:09:00,999
Oh, well. Thanks again.

143
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:05,128
You should come visit Toyama sometime.

144
00:09:07,506 --> 00:09:08,340
All right.

145
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:33,657

-Hang in there!

<i>For some reason, whenever I saw her...</i>

155
00:11:08,794 --> 00:11:10,253
<i>I felt free.</i>

-I wanna eat it now!
-Yeah!

157
00:11:31,108 --> 00:11:32,150
Hello?

I'm waiting for my car.

00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:40,659
<i>It's Christmas Eve,</i>
<i>so you'll be home for dinner, right?</i>

161
00:11:42,119 --> 00:11:45,080
No, I'm going back to the office.
I'll be a little late.

162
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:48,834
<i>Come on, you know you're the only one</i>
<i>working on a day like this.</i>

163
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:02,013
For me?

164
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:28,707
Thanks.

165
00:12:30,292 --> 00:12:31,668
Merry Christmas.

166
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:46,516
It's the first snow.

What is this you brought us?

175
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:57,087
They're chocolates.

176
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:58,129
Chocolates.

177

00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:02,008
-Yes, please.
-Thank you.

179
00:14:02,092 --> 00:14:03,468
STAFF TRANSFER ANNOUNCEMENT

180
00:14:03,552 --> 00:14:05,512
{\an8}WATARU SUZUKI
DIRECTOR OF RESTAURANT OPERATIONS

181
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:07,973
{\an8}2016

182
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:09,099
{\an8}2025

183
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:13,937
{\an8}Suzutoya Holdings has decided to withdraw
from the restaurant business.

184
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:16,189
For over 50 years,

185
00:14:16,815 --> 00:14:23,238
this restaurant has been
a place of comfort for this community.

186
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:27,325
And now,
you're just going to tear it down?

187
00:14:27,409 --> 00:14:29,995
The decline in revenue
caused by the COVID-19 pandemic

188
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:31,204
was the decisive factor.

189
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:35,750
I sincerely regret
that it turned out this way.

190
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:44,050
When you were little,
you used to come here often.

191
00:14:44,718 --> 00:14:46,052
With your mother.

192
00:14:46,928 --> 00:14:48,054
This is a real shame.

193
00:14:55,145 --> 00:14:58,148
Hurry up, Mom.
I want to eat a matcha parfait.

194
00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:02,485
Director Suzuki.

195
00:15:03,987 --> 00:15:06,698
You're from the second planning division,
aren't you?

196
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:09,034
I'm Sumiyoshi.

197
00:15:13,788 --> 00:15:15,373
Nice to see you again.

198
00:15:15,457 --> 00:15:20,045
You too. I left headquarters
a long time ago.

199
00:15:20,754 --> 00:15:23,715
I heard that you transferred over
to Restaurant Operations.

200
00:15:23,798 --> 00:15:24,633
Yes.

201
00:15:25,342 --> 00:15:28,011
How is everyone
at the second planning division?

202
00:15:29,971 --> 00:15:33,600
Actually, I left the company.

203
00:15:34,768 --> 00:15:36,978
I have some issues with my health...

204
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:42,400
As my successor,
Ms. Kanbe was doing her best, but...

205
00:15:42,484 --> 00:15:47,489
I remember her being
a hardworking and talented employee.

206
00:15:49,616 --> 00:15:53,953
God is... really unfair, don't you think?

207
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:57,040
What do you mean?

208
00:16:13,848 --> 00:16:17,352
<i>I heard Ms. Kanbe</i>
<i>was diagnosed with cancer...</i>

209
00:16:17,435 --> 00:16:19,396
and that it's terminal.

210
00:16:20,522 --> 00:16:22,148
Her husband Hirano...

211
00:16:22,857 --> 00:16:28,905
He's too busy with some other woman
to even visit.

212
00:16:30,782 --> 00:16:32,409
<i>Even if I end up bothering her...</i>

213
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:36,830
<i>if I can do anything at all</i>
<i>to help her, I will.</i>

214
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:41,292
Excuse me.

215
00:16:41,793 --> 00:16:43,837
Is Kanbe... No.

216
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:47,048
Is Ms. Misa Hirano here?
I'd like to see her.

217
00:16:47,132 --> 00:16:50,260
Ms. Hirano has returned
to her home for the day.

218
00:16:50,969 --> 00:16:52,220
I see.

219
00:16:57,642 --> 00:16:59,436
I understand. Thank you.

220
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:48,109
What a disgraceful way to die!

221
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:54,991
There's no way I'm letting her ashes
into our family grave.

222
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,451
She's nothing but bad luck!

223
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:03,208
Tomoya Hirano. Reina Esaka.
You are under arrest for murder.

224
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:05,502
Huh? Wait. No, sir!

225
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:11,049
My son didn't do anything!
That woman jumped off on her own!

226
00:18:11,132 --> 00:18:12,675
Will you come with us too?

227
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:14,552
It's about the revisions
to her life insurance.

228
00:18:14,636 --> 00:18:16,429
Let go of me, you bastards!

229
00:18:16,513 --> 00:18:20,183
My daughter really likes
the scenery of Toyama.

230
00:18:21,726 --> 00:18:24,646
Hey, Tomo! Tomo!

231
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:28,525
Let go of him! Hey...
He didn't do anything!

232
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:32,487
{\an8}That woman jumped off on her own!

233
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:33,530
{\an8}Tomo!

234
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:35,573
Tomo! No!

235
00:18:35,657 --> 00:18:38,535
Tomo. Hey! Let him go!

236
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:39,911
Tomo!

237
00:18:39,994 --> 00:18:43,665
Let him go! Tomo!

238
00:18:43,748 --> 00:18:45,416
We don't know anything!

239
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,420
I told you that woman jumped on her own!

240
00:19:19,993 --> 00:19:24,831
I'm never... going to let you die again.

241
00:20:13,671 --> 00:20:15,632
I'm sorry. Please come in.

242
00:20:16,341 --> 00:20:17,842
No, I'm fine...

243
00:20:20,511 --> 00:20:21,930
Please come in.

244
00:20:25,475 --> 00:20:26,476
Excuse me.

245
00:20:32,023 --> 00:20:33,524
Please change into this.

246
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,611
No, I'm fine.

247
00:20:36,694 --> 00:20:39,906
I don't want you to catch a cold.
At least just the top.

248
00:20:43,701 --> 00:20:44,577
Thank you.

249
00:20:56,547 --> 00:20:57,757
Are you okay?

250
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,176
Yes.

251
00:21:04,055 --> 00:21:05,348
What happened?

252
00:21:11,354 --> 00:21:14,774
I got sick of it all.

253
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,777
I tried to change my fate.

254
00:21:18,736 --> 00:21:20,196
I told him we're breaking up.

255
00:21:21,364 --> 00:21:22,949
I said I didn't want to get married.

256
00:21:24,993 --> 00:21:28,496
But... it doesn't seem to work that way.

257
00:21:31,332 --> 00:21:32,417
Without a substitute.

258
00:21:33,418 --> 00:21:34,544
A substitute?

259
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:40,049
<i>I was the one</i>
<i>who was supposed to get burned.</i>

260
00:21:40,133 --> 00:21:41,759
But then you stepped in...

261
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:46,597
Why were you at that apartment?

262
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:50,852
I was taking a cab
through the neighborhood...

263
00:21:51,686 --> 00:21:53,896
and saw you heading to the apartment.

264
00:21:54,647 --> 00:21:58,609
Why are you helping me?

265
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:02,280
Why are you trying
to get involved with me?

266
00:22:03,531 --> 00:22:05,408
I don't understand why.

267
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:26,846
Actually...

268
00:22:32,018 --> 00:22:33,269
What's wrong?

269
00:22:35,146 --> 00:22:36,022
I'm sorry.

270
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:40,234
It's just... It looks terrible on you.

271
00:22:48,076 --> 00:22:48,910
Actually...

272
00:22:51,662 --> 00:22:54,540
we've met before. In college.

273
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:56,125
What?

274
00:22:56,209 --> 00:22:59,712
At the pond, near the bench
where I was always reading,

275
00:23:01,297 --> 00:23:04,050
you were always talking to a turtle.

276
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:08,054
What? That Daidai Pond?

277
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:10,014
Yes.

278
00:23:10,098 --> 00:23:11,974
We went to the same university?

279
00:23:12,058 --> 00:23:12,934
Yes.

280
00:23:14,685 --> 00:23:19,357
You saw me... talking to the turtle?

281
00:23:20,733 --> 00:23:24,612
Always... just you and that same turtle.

282
00:23:27,156 --> 00:23:29,158
I didn't have any other friends...

283
00:23:30,368 --> 00:23:31,786
So you just spied on me?

284
00:23:31,869 --> 00:23:34,080
You're the one
who came into my line of sight.

285
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:40,628
Can't miss the strange, lonely girl
that talks to a turtle, right?

286
00:23:42,755 --> 00:23:43,589
Right.

287
00:23:51,722 --> 00:23:54,851
When you joined the company as a new hire,

288
00:23:57,228 --> 00:24:01,315
I kept hoping that I'd get a chance
to speak with you.

289
00:24:02,567 --> 00:24:04,902
You should have just talked to me.

290
00:24:05,945 --> 00:24:07,363
You're right.

291
00:24:08,281 --> 00:24:09,490
That's why...

292
00:24:10,908 --> 00:24:12,535
I'm talking to you now.

293
00:24:18,708 --> 00:24:19,667
That day,

294
00:24:20,418 --> 00:24:22,962
you jumped into the elevator.

295
00:24:23,045 --> 00:24:23,880
<i>Sorry, sorry!</i>

296
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:33,222
<i>It...</i>

297
00:24:35,975 --> 00:24:40,438
It made me want to... change my life.

298
00:24:57,663 --> 00:25:00,166
Ms. Kanbe, it's Miku.

299
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:09,884
<i>Hello?</i>

300
00:25:09,967 --> 00:25:11,135
Tomoya?

301
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:16,933
<i>Reina. What is it? What happened?</i>

302
00:25:18,017 --> 00:25:21,604
Misa hasn't been well lately,
so I'm getting worried about her.

303
00:25:22,188 --> 00:25:24,523
Like maybe something happened or...

304
00:25:24,982 --> 00:25:26,067
Reina...

305
00:25:27,485 --> 00:25:29,695
I think I might be screwed.

306
00:25:31,697 --> 00:25:32,740
<i>Misa said...</i>

307
00:25:33,574 --> 00:25:35,952
she wants to break up!

308
00:25:44,043 --> 00:25:45,544
<i>This sucks!</i>

309
00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:47,922
Tomoya?

310
00:25:49,006 --> 00:25:50,049
Calm down.

311
00:25:50,132 --> 00:25:51,425
Tell me what happened.

312
00:25:52,343 --> 00:25:53,761
Don't worry.

313
00:25:54,303 --> 00:25:56,639
I'll talk it over with you.

314
00:26:36,637 --> 00:26:41,517
I'm never... going to let you die again.

315
00:26:43,561 --> 00:26:46,564
Never... again...

316
00:26:48,816 --> 00:26:49,817
"Again"?

317
00:26:50,985 --> 00:26:52,695
What did he mean by "again"?

318
00:26:57,450 --> 00:26:58,826
Maybe I misheard it...

319
00:27:09,253 --> 00:27:12,006
What are you going to do
with the apartment?

320
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:16,218
I think you should
definitely cancel the contract.

321
00:27:16,302 --> 00:27:19,096
Even if it was an accident,
almost falling from the eighth floor?

322
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:20,473
That's seriously bad luck.

323
00:27:21,182 --> 00:27:23,184
That's true, but...

324
00:27:23,267 --> 00:27:25,603
<i>When I tried to force</i>
<i>my way out of the wedding,</i>

325
00:27:25,686 --> 00:27:28,481
<i>the same ending that my first life had</i>
<i>came to me again.</i>

326
00:27:28,564 --> 00:27:30,691
<i>Without a substitute,</i>
<i>fate can't be changed.</i>

327
00:27:31,692 --> 00:27:33,152
<i>If that's true, then I have to...</i>

328
00:27:35,321 --> 00:27:36,614
Misa...

329
00:27:36,697 --> 00:27:41,160
I'm sorry I made things confusing for you
with my horrible apology yesterday.

330
00:27:41,911 --> 00:27:45,790
So, about not getting married,
or breaking up, or whatever...

331
00:27:45,873 --> 00:27:48,626
We've spent so much time
building this relationship,

332
00:27:48,709 --> 00:27:50,920
throwing it away
over something like this is just...

333
00:27:51,003 --> 00:27:52,922
I don't know what happened,

334
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:55,466
but an ambush on the way to work
is just plain creepy.

335
00:27:55,549 --> 00:27:56,926
This has nothing to do with you.

336
00:27:57,009 --> 00:28:00,304
Oh, sorry, Miku. Could you go on ahead?

337
00:28:00,388 --> 00:28:01,722
Sure...

338
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:03,933
Are you okay?

339
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:05,434
I'll be fine, thanks.

340
00:28:16,529 --> 00:28:19,782
I was got too emotional yesterday. Sorry.

341
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:25,538
I'm not hung up on it at all.
Really, it doesn't bother me at all.

342
00:28:25,621 --> 00:28:28,082
Let's just say we both messed up
and call it even.

343
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:33,712
Anyway, crypto's up again,
so I invested more.

344
00:28:33,796 --> 00:28:37,925
At this rate, I might be able
to buy that new condo in cash.

345
00:28:39,176 --> 00:28:40,010
You eat breakfast yet?

346
00:28:40,094 --> 00:28:43,139
<i>If it's a guy I dumped,</i>
<i>Reina won't want him.</i>

347
00:28:43,222 --> 00:28:44,223
I'll treat you.

348
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:47,893
Misa, are you listening?

349
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:54,442
Why doesn't she just dump him already?

350
00:28:54,984 --> 00:28:56,735
I guess the more a girl has it together,

351
00:28:56,819 --> 00:28:59,196
the more likely they are
to fall for a sleazebag.

352
00:28:59,697 --> 00:29:01,031
Are you talking about Ms. Kanbe?

353
00:29:01,115 --> 00:29:03,075
Honestly, I'm worried.

354
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:05,411
Let's do another girls' night out soon.

355
00:29:05,911 --> 00:29:06,745
Yep.

356
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:10,249
Reina,

357
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,209
wanna go to lunch with me?

358
00:29:15,379 --> 00:29:18,841
I've got some things
to discuss about Tomoya.

359
00:29:20,801 --> 00:29:23,721
Of course. Tell me everything.

360
00:29:25,181 --> 00:29:26,265
Let's eat!

361
00:29:26,849 --> 00:29:29,768
Anyway, let's dig in!
If you don't eat, you won't have energy.

362
00:29:31,687 --> 00:29:33,898
We decided on the day to meet his parents.

363
00:29:35,399 --> 00:29:36,233
Huh?

364
00:29:37,485 --> 00:29:39,987
I'm meeting Tomoya's parents
for the first time,

365
00:29:40,696 --> 00:29:42,615
so I don't know
what kind of clothes to wear.

366
00:29:42,698 --> 00:29:44,533
I'm really stressed out over it...

367
00:29:45,868 --> 00:29:48,204
Is that what you wanted to talk about?

368
00:29:48,287 --> 00:29:51,749
Yeah. Reina, you have good taste,
so I wanted your advice.

369
00:29:52,333 --> 00:29:54,793
Will you go shopping with me?

370
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:58,380
I thought things weren't
going well with Tomoya?

371
00:29:59,006 --> 00:30:01,550
Huh? No, no, it's not like that at all!

372
00:30:01,634 --> 00:30:06,514
Actually, just yesterday, he surprised me
by reserving a brand-new condo.

373
00:30:06,597 --> 00:30:09,433
But he should've talked to me first,
so we argued a bit.

374
00:30:09,517 --> 00:30:10,726
But we made up this morning.

375
00:30:13,687 --> 00:30:18,150
Reina, I heard
you told Tomoya about my mother.

376
00:30:20,402 --> 00:30:22,780
It was hard for me to tell him.

377
00:30:23,656 --> 00:30:26,700
I thought Tomoya
might not like me anymore,

378
00:30:27,743 --> 00:30:30,037
but he said he didn't mind at all,

379
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:33,123
and he was all worried
about how hard it was for me.

380
00:30:33,749 --> 00:30:35,501
So it actually brought us closer together.

381
00:30:35,584 --> 00:30:37,461
Thank you so much.

382
00:30:39,088 --> 00:30:40,089
Let's eat!

383
00:30:53,477 --> 00:30:54,728
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

384
00:30:55,312 --> 00:30:58,607
<i>thank you very much for attending</i>

385
00:30:58,691 --> 00:31:01,694
the Suzutoya Holdings
Hospitality Tasting Event today.

386
00:31:02,278 --> 00:31:04,071
In 2020, five years from now,

387
00:31:05,114 --> 00:31:07,825
the Olympic Games will be held in Tokyo.

388
00:31:08,367 --> 00:31:10,244
The Tokyo Olympics will be

389
00:31:10,327 --> 00:31:13,622
a major event to promote
our country as a tourist destination.

390
00:31:16,667 --> 00:31:21,797
<i>The number of foreign visitors to Japan</i>
<i>is targeted at 40 million per year.</i>

391
00:31:22,464 --> 00:31:23,924
We need to reconsider.

392
00:31:24,466 --> 00:31:28,887
Investing so much into
an Olympic-related business is risky.

393
00:31:29,597 --> 00:31:32,725
I'd like to propose measures
to reduce losses in restaurant operations.

394
00:31:32,808 --> 00:31:36,145
That's exactly why
you're not fit to be a leader.

395
00:31:36,228 --> 00:31:37,229
Enough. Stop talking!

396
00:31:38,522 --> 00:31:43,819
At Suzutoya, we believe it is our mission
to share Japan's rich culinary culture

397
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:47,406
with guests from around the world,

398
00:31:47,489 --> 00:31:50,659
and to offer heartfelt hospitality
in everything we do.

399
00:31:50,743 --> 00:31:54,079
Please relax and enjoy the event today.

400
00:32:15,142 --> 00:32:16,477
HOSPITALITY TASTING EVENT

401
00:32:56,809 --> 00:32:58,102
These are mushi manju.

402
00:32:58,185 --> 00:33:00,062
-Brown, white? Here you are.
-Thank you.

403
00:33:00,145 --> 00:33:02,523
Hey, what's going on,
Second Planning Division?

404
00:33:02,606 --> 00:33:03,899
Is there a problem?

405
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:05,693
There's a problem, all right.

406
00:33:05,776 --> 00:33:08,195
The chairman of Asahi Department Store
was hospitalized

407
00:33:08,278 --> 00:33:12,324
for his peanut allergy after eating
a mushi manju served at the tasting event!

408
00:33:12,408 --> 00:33:13,242
What?

409
00:33:14,243 --> 00:33:18,247
His wife said that a female employee
gave her this list of ingredients.

410
00:33:20,124 --> 00:33:22,084
Someone gave her
the wrong ingredient list.

411
00:33:22,584 --> 00:33:25,212
Of all people, the chairman
of Asahi Department Store?

412
00:33:25,963 --> 00:33:29,299
Who was it? Who was in charge
of the live kitchen at the tasting event?

413
00:33:37,057 --> 00:33:38,684
Here you are.

414
00:33:39,226 --> 00:33:41,437
-Would anybody like one? Thank you.
-Yes, thank you.

415
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,646
<i>That's right, at this time...</i>

416
00:33:44,231 --> 00:33:45,399
Excuse me.

417
00:33:45,482 --> 00:33:49,236
Please only serve mushi manju with
red bean paste and white bean paste today.

418
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:51,572
Please do not serve ones
with peanut paste.

419
00:33:51,655 --> 00:33:53,407
Yes, we've been informed.

420
00:33:54,158 --> 00:33:56,368
Huh? By whom?

421
00:34:00,873 --> 00:34:01,790
Director.

422
00:34:04,793 --> 00:34:05,961
What are you doing?

423
00:34:07,629 --> 00:34:11,717
One of our guests who loves this shop's
mushi manju will be visiting tomorrow.

424
00:34:12,426 --> 00:34:13,635
Are you keeping some on hold?

425
00:34:14,178 --> 00:34:15,012
Yes.

426
00:34:15,721 --> 00:34:16,764
This many?

427
00:34:17,473 --> 00:34:18,307
Yes.

428
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:19,892
Just the peanut ones?

429
00:34:21,143 --> 00:34:21,977
Ms. Kanbe.

430
00:34:22,644 --> 00:34:25,063
-Yes.
-We have a lot of guests.

431
00:34:25,147 --> 00:34:27,191
Should you really
be wasting your time here?

432
00:34:55,969 --> 00:34:58,180
Come to think of it, Misa...

433
00:34:58,263 --> 00:35:01,350
said that Director Suzuki
made a pass at her too.

434
00:35:14,154 --> 00:35:17,115
Director Suzuki,
may I have a word with you?

435
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,159
What is it?

436
00:35:19,243 --> 00:35:20,953
As director, I think you should

437
00:35:21,036 --> 00:35:23,664
refrain from any behavior
that could be misunderstood.

438
00:35:24,373 --> 00:35:25,916
And what kind of behavior is that?

439
00:35:26,959 --> 00:35:27,918
Well...

440
00:35:28,877 --> 00:35:29,920
For example,

441
00:35:31,255 --> 00:35:33,006
hitting on your subordinate's fiancée.

442
00:35:36,844 --> 00:35:39,471
Oh... Does that ring a bell?

443
00:35:39,555 --> 00:35:41,265
Is this something to talk about at work?

444
00:35:41,348 --> 00:35:44,059
You know that Ms. Kanbe and I
are engaged, right?

445
00:35:44,685 --> 00:35:47,646
You even celebrated with us
at the vineyard the other day.

446
00:35:47,729 --> 00:35:49,690
I didn't celebrate anything.

447
00:35:50,566 --> 00:35:51,400
Huh?

448
00:35:52,359 --> 00:35:54,444
You two don't suit each other at all.

449
00:35:55,404 --> 00:35:57,155
Can't you see that yourself?

450
00:35:58,407 --> 00:36:00,158
You're not a good match for her.

451
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:23,015
So exhausting with all the VIP guests.

452
00:36:32,149 --> 00:36:33,692
Why are these back here?

453
00:36:35,444 --> 00:36:37,404
What a waste.

454
00:36:47,289 --> 00:36:49,791
Oh, the chairman of Asahi.
Are you on your way out?

455
00:36:50,834 --> 00:36:51,710
Who are you?

456
00:36:51,793 --> 00:36:55,047
I'm Tomita of Suzutoya Holdings'
second planning division.

457
00:36:55,631 --> 00:36:58,175
I'm already done greeting people,
so I'll be leaving.

458
00:36:58,258 --> 00:37:00,594
Then, I'll see you out.
I'll go get my boss.

459
00:37:00,677 --> 00:37:03,680
No, no. I don't want to make a fuss.

460
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:06,725
In that case,
may I at least offer you a gift?

461
00:37:06,808 --> 00:37:10,687
These are mushi manju
from a very famous confectioner.

462
00:37:13,565 --> 00:37:15,776
Could you give us the list of ingredients?

463
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,236
-A list of ingredients?
-Yes.

464
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,571
Please wait a moment.

465
00:37:20,447 --> 00:37:21,448
Ms. Esaka.

466
00:37:21,531 --> 00:37:24,409
Can you bring me the list of ingredients
for the mushi manju?

467
00:37:24,493 --> 00:37:25,535
Hurry up.

468
00:37:25,619 --> 00:37:27,871
-We'll bring it right away.
-Yes. Thank you.

469
00:37:29,039 --> 00:37:29,957
Well, today...

470
00:37:31,917 --> 00:37:33,919
Always when I'm
in the middle of something.

471
00:37:34,002 --> 00:37:38,465
WHITE BEAN PASTE - PEANUT PASTE

472
00:37:38,548 --> 00:37:40,175
You can never be too careful nowadays...

473
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:41,093
Yeah.

474
00:37:41,176 --> 00:37:42,844
Thank you for your patience.

475
00:37:42,928 --> 00:37:44,805
Here is the ingredient list
for the mushi manju.

476
00:37:44,888 --> 00:37:46,723
Thank you. Okay, let's go.

477
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:55,148
Nitpicky old hag.

478
00:38:06,576 --> 00:38:09,496
Ms. Kanbe, can you attend
to that group over there?

479
00:38:09,579 --> 00:38:11,039
-Yes, got it.
-Thanks.

480
00:38:12,666 --> 00:38:14,251
-Are you enjoying the event?
-Yes.

481
00:38:14,334 --> 00:38:16,169
-Very good time. Thank you.
-That's good.

482
00:38:17,713 --> 00:38:19,381
Did you have anything you liked?

483
00:38:54,499 --> 00:38:55,625
Misa!

484
00:38:56,793 --> 00:39:01,339
Still working, huh? That's so you,
just like the class representative.

485
00:39:02,049 --> 00:39:04,342
I have to prepare
for the noon session tomorrow.

486
00:39:06,595 --> 00:39:08,472
Everyone's already at the reception.

487
00:39:10,015 --> 00:39:12,100
But honestly, that sounds like a hassle.

488
00:39:12,184 --> 00:39:13,769
Wanna grab a drink, just the two of us?

489
00:39:13,852 --> 00:39:17,022
I got a few tips
on some good local izakaya.

490
00:39:18,607 --> 00:39:21,359
But I'll be a while,
so you can go with someone else.

491
00:39:21,443 --> 00:39:22,402
What?

492
00:39:24,696 --> 00:39:28,492
Okay, I'll just wait right here
until your work is done.

493
00:39:33,997 --> 00:39:34,915
Oh...

494
00:39:36,541 --> 00:39:37,584
Am I intruding?

495
00:39:37,667 --> 00:39:39,503
Oh, well, you're not intruding but...

496
00:39:41,963 --> 00:39:44,091
You asked me earlier!

497
00:39:44,174 --> 00:39:46,134
About what to wear
to meet Tomoya's parents.

498
00:39:46,218 --> 00:39:49,096
-You wanted to talk about it.
-We can do that another time.

499
00:39:55,268 --> 00:39:57,312
"Let's go shopping together"?

500
00:39:57,938 --> 00:39:59,648
"Let's pick out clothes together"?

501
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:04,736
Misa... do you really want my opinion?

502
00:40:06,113 --> 00:40:07,197
What do you mean?

503
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,698
You don't mean it, do you?

504
00:40:09,366 --> 00:40:12,702
Like when you said,
"Thank you so much for telling Tomoya

505
00:40:12,786 --> 00:40:16,081
about my mom abandoning me for a man."

506
00:40:20,168 --> 00:40:23,004
Hey, Misa, what are you so angry about?

507
00:40:23,713 --> 00:40:24,548
Angry?

508
00:40:25,048 --> 00:40:26,925
Tell me how you really feel.

509
00:40:27,676 --> 00:40:30,929
I don't know how you feel at all
these days.

510
00:40:31,888 --> 00:40:33,515
You're really angry, aren't you?

511
00:40:34,099 --> 00:40:36,518
-What are you talking about?
-That's enough!

512
00:40:36,601 --> 00:40:38,687
There's something
that's bothering you, right?

513
00:40:39,396 --> 00:40:40,772
Is it about the class reunion?

514
00:40:41,606 --> 00:40:45,068
Maybe you still haven't forgiven me
for what happened with Yuto?

515
00:40:45,152 --> 00:40:47,362
-That was a long time ago.
-Then what?

516
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:50,991
What did I do to you?

517
00:40:53,743 --> 00:40:55,704
Just tell me already!

518
00:40:56,746 --> 00:40:57,706
It's just...

519
00:41:01,877 --> 00:41:05,505
I'm just getting
a little tired of being friends.

520
00:41:08,008 --> 00:41:11,970
I always thought that
I would be lost without you.

521
00:41:12,512 --> 00:41:16,057
That without you, I would be alone...

522
00:41:18,101 --> 00:41:20,854
But that wasn't true.

523
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:24,858
I have Tomoya.

524
00:41:28,028 --> 00:41:29,529
Oh, sorry.

525
00:41:29,613 --> 00:41:32,073
I'm actually meeting up
with Tomoya tonight.

526
00:41:32,782 --> 00:41:36,161
The view from my room is amazing at night,

527
00:41:36,244 --> 00:41:39,664
and we're planning to have
some drinks there after work.

528
00:41:43,335 --> 00:41:44,794
Reina,

529
00:41:45,795 --> 00:41:48,131
don't worry yourself so much over me.

530
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,884
Find someone nice.

531
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:58,225
Oh, I'll help with that!

532
00:42:47,983 --> 00:42:49,234
Reina.

533
00:42:51,945 --> 00:42:53,196
What's up?

534
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:54,531
What do you want?

535
00:42:55,532 --> 00:42:56,783
Have you seen Misa?

536
00:42:57,450 --> 00:42:59,869
I'm looking for her,
but I can't find her anywhere.

537
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:01,871
She's working.

538
00:43:02,706 --> 00:43:04,291
She's still working?

539
00:43:11,131 --> 00:43:14,509
I just... want to cry.

540
00:43:25,937 --> 00:43:26,980
There, there.

541
00:43:29,357 --> 00:43:33,611
I'm... always trying so hard.

542
00:43:35,822 --> 00:43:37,073
You are.

543
00:43:37,991 --> 00:43:39,075
Good for you.

544
00:43:40,994 --> 00:43:43,496
I always feel so alone!

545
00:43:44,205 --> 00:43:45,457
You poor thing.

546
00:43:46,708 --> 00:43:48,084
It's okay.

547
00:43:53,757 --> 00:43:54,674
You're so nice.

548
00:44:01,306 --> 00:44:02,640
{\an8}What do you think this is?

549
00:44:04,476 --> 00:44:06,728
The key to Misa's room.

550
00:44:08,938 --> 00:44:12,776
She said the view
is just gorgeous at night,

551
00:44:13,526 --> 00:44:17,947
but hard-working Misa
is working until late.

552
00:44:20,867 --> 00:44:25,538
Can you imagine
how exciting this situation could get?

553
00:44:29,084 --> 00:44:30,460
Just tonight.

554
00:44:31,211 --> 00:44:33,046
Just once before you get married...

555
00:44:34,714 --> 00:44:35,799
let's do something bad.

556
00:45:08,164 --> 00:45:09,833
-To Grand Stay Hotel.
-Got it.

557
00:46:14,522 --> 00:46:15,565
You'll get cold.

558
00:46:49,516 --> 00:46:52,310
That's not how
you're supposed to drink whiskey.

559
00:46:55,355 --> 00:46:57,565
You're not going to
ask me anything, are you?

560
00:47:01,277 --> 00:47:08,243
When I saw them in the cab earlier,
I thought of something strange.

561
00:47:09,118 --> 00:47:10,119
Something strange?

562
00:47:12,205 --> 00:47:14,582
How I fell in love with that man.

563
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:20,338
Do you want to exchange contacts?

564
00:47:26,511 --> 00:47:31,516
<i>I thought, "Oh, here we go again."</i>

565
00:47:33,685 --> 00:47:39,899
Everyone who talks to me
ends up liking Reina.

566
00:47:42,318 --> 00:47:43,736
Actually... I think I won't.

567
00:47:44,487 --> 00:47:45,321
What?

568
00:47:45,405 --> 00:47:47,282
I don't want Ms. Kanbe to misunderstand.

569
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:56,624
<i>Just from that one small thing...</i>

570
00:47:58,710 --> 00:48:03,089
I found myself thinking,
"I can trust this person."

571
00:48:05,133 --> 00:48:07,385
It was such a tiny gesture,

572
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:14,017
but back then, it meant the world to me.

573
00:48:16,644 --> 00:48:21,608
For some reason, I suddenly remembered
that moment from so long ago.

574
00:48:22,984 --> 00:48:24,485
Silly, right?

575
00:48:28,489 --> 00:48:30,074
Do you regret it?

576
00:48:32,577 --> 00:48:33,911
Not at all!

577
00:48:42,128 --> 00:48:44,339
Let's think about the future.

578
00:48:45,381 --> 00:48:47,592
There's so much to look forward to.

579
00:48:49,218 --> 00:48:51,012
I hope so.

580
00:48:51,095 --> 00:48:52,430
You don't believe so?

581
00:48:53,139 --> 00:48:54,807
Life is harsh.

582
00:48:56,267 --> 00:48:58,895
And you don't have the will
to dream of something better?

583
00:49:00,271 --> 00:49:02,690
Honestly... I don't.

584
00:49:06,402 --> 00:49:07,445
What about you?

585
00:49:08,571 --> 00:49:09,405
Huh?

586
00:49:10,239 --> 00:49:12,116
Do you have anything?

587
00:49:13,326 --> 00:49:14,619
Like a dream or...

588
00:49:22,168 --> 00:49:23,795
My dream...

589
00:49:25,129 --> 00:49:26,339
Shall I talk about it?

590
00:49:28,257 --> 00:49:30,259
My dreams for the future...

591
00:49:30,343 --> 00:49:31,177
Yeah.

592
00:49:32,804 --> 00:49:36,516
We get to know each other a little better.

593
00:49:37,392 --> 00:49:42,105
So far, the only thing we have in common
is a love of monaka and hojicha.

594
00:49:43,064 --> 00:49:44,315
We need real conversations.

595
00:49:45,692 --> 00:49:46,567
Yeah.

596
00:49:47,902 --> 00:49:49,404
Because...

597
00:49:50,697 --> 00:49:54,409
we don't know each other's
favorite books, music, or movies.

598
00:49:57,161 --> 00:49:58,246
That's why...

599
00:50:00,415 --> 00:50:02,875
we need to spend
a little more time together first.

600
00:50:04,377 --> 00:50:07,130
Strolling through the park, having tea...

601
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:11,467
watching movies
and exchanging thoughts afterward.

602
00:50:16,723 --> 00:50:22,395
Let's go watch <i>Your Name </i>and <i>La La Land.</i>

603
00:50:29,986 --> 00:50:32,655
We'll stroll around after the movie,

604
00:50:34,282 --> 00:50:38,369
join the line with the high school girls
in Harajuku,

605
00:50:40,121 --> 00:50:44,292
and have some tapioca milk tea.

606
00:50:45,585 --> 00:50:48,463
If you want to take pictures
at Instagrammable spots...

607
00:50:50,631 --> 00:50:53,843
well, I'll just have to tag along.

608
00:50:56,387 --> 00:50:59,766
When the state of emergency gets declared,
we can't go see each other,

609
00:51:00,975 --> 00:51:02,560
but we'll talk online.

610
00:51:04,854 --> 00:51:08,274
And during the no-spectator 2021 Olympics,

611
00:51:10,276 --> 00:51:12,737
let's cheer on the skateboarders
winning gold...

612
00:51:14,947 --> 00:51:16,741
from the sofa at home.

613
00:51:20,495 --> 00:51:22,330
Once the pandemic calms down,

614
00:51:23,623 --> 00:51:25,416
and our daily lives come back...

615
00:51:32,590 --> 00:51:34,133
Let's go wherever...

616
00:51:36,135 --> 00:51:37,470
together.

617
00:51:38,554 --> 00:51:40,723
Even to Toyama, where you were born.

618
00:51:42,850 --> 00:51:43,893
Or...

619
00:51:45,686 --> 00:51:49,398
we can go to Los Angeles
to watch Shohei Ohtani.

620
00:51:53,444 --> 00:51:54,362
This is...

621
00:51:59,408 --> 00:52:02,161
the future I wanted to spend with you.
