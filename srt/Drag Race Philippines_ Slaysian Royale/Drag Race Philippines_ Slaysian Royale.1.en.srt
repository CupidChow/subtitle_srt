1
00:00:05,156 --> 00:00:06,467
The tea is hot!

2
00:00:07,608 --> 00:00:09,177
The rice is steaming!

3
00:00:09,549 --> 00:00:10,767
And the competition?

4
00:00:10,966 --> 00:00:13,892
Spicier than your
auntie's secret chili oil!

5
00:00:14,011 --> 00:00:17,640
So grab your bobas and get ready
for the ultimate and

6
00:00:17,709 --> 00:00:20,515
fiercest battle of Asian
drag excellence!

7
00:00:21,001 --> 00:00:24,297
Slaysian divas of the world, unite!

8
00:00:35,466 --> 00:00:38,830
Hi guys, this is Arizona Brandy,
twenty-eight years old,

9
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:41,293
Drag Race Philippines Season Two winner.

10
00:00:42,283 --> 00:00:45,822
In an alternate
universe. Tada.. hahahaha

11
00:00:45,948 --> 00:00:47,982
Welcome to Drag Race Philippines,

12
00:00:48,083 --> 00:00:50,735
Slaysian Royale

13
00:00:50,936 --> 00:00:51,871
And I,

14
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:53,906
Thank you!

15
00:00:54,622 --> 00:00:59,286
Our season, Drag Race Philippines Season
Two, I think is the most fun.

16
00:00:59,352 --> 00:01:04,216
I just came there to have fun and
have drinks. But this time, I'm here to

17
00:01:04,583 --> 00:01:05,172
Win.

18
00:01:05,279 --> 00:01:06,074
I am good.

19
00:01:08,547 --> 00:01:13,907
A small lady came in. That was the
time I knew this is an all-Asian season.

20
00:01:23,065 --> 00:01:25,461
Did somebody order a drag queen?

21
00:01:27,177 --> 00:01:30,511
Hey, everyone. It's me, Yuwa Hamasaki
from RuPaul's Drag Race

22
00:01:30,566 --> 00:01:32,533
Season Ten. And guess what, bitches?

23
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:34,645
I'm back for what?

24
00:01:34,856 --> 00:01:37,738
Drag Race Philippines Slaysian
Royale, honey.

25
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:40,524
Oh, my God.

26
00:01:40,561 --> 00:01:41,681
Yuhua, what's your name?

27
00:01:41,951 --> 00:01:44,854
- Arizona Brandy
- Arizona Brandy

28
00:01:44,904 --> 00:01:46,365
Oh my God, we kind of match.

29
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:50,910
I am now going by just Yuhua because I'm
dropping Hamasaki because I feel

30
00:01:50,971 --> 00:01:53,297
like this is a rebirth. It's a new me.

31
00:01:53,351 --> 00:01:57,127
I've learned so much along the way that
Hamasaki is not really part of

32
00:01:57,181 --> 00:01:57,774
me anymore.

33
00:01:57,895 --> 00:01:58,871
I'm just Yuhua.

34
00:01:58,996 --> 00:02:00,657
Oh my God, give me a spin
of your outfit.

35
00:02:01,237 --> 00:02:03,276
Gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous.

36
00:02:03,308 --> 00:02:04,737
How about you give me a spin too?

37
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:07,842
Okay, I'll give you a spin.
You know how it is.

38
00:02:07,945 --> 00:02:10,668
I used to watch her season.
And I love her.

39
00:02:11,353 --> 00:02:15,176
So I'm like, okay, this is
getting real now. Ah, getting real.

40
00:02:16,611 --> 00:02:17,861
Uh-oh, who is it?

41
00:02:18,922 --> 00:02:22,524
Is there gonna be, like, a token
white person in the cast?

42
00:02:22,591 --> 00:02:25,437
Give us Caucasian culture, baby! Yas!

43
00:02:32,613 --> 00:02:34,353
She lost her culture.

44
00:02:36,208 --> 00:02:37,199
Ding Ding Ding

45
00:02:37,231 --> 00:02:40,487
It's a new ding in the werkroom!

46
00:02:41,943 --> 00:02:46,079
Ding, ding, ding! My name is Brigiding,
the brightest star of

47
00:02:46,146 --> 00:02:48,587
season one of Drag Race Philippines.

48
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:53,684
Baby, Oh my goodness, giving us glamour.

49
00:02:53,753 --> 00:02:56,948
Before Drag Race, I met her in two
thousand nineteen with Cyndi

50
00:02:56,999 --> 00:03:00,397
Lauper. We danced for her during World
Pride two thousand nineteen.

51
00:03:00,397 --> 00:03:03,445
I wasn't surprised that she was
going to be here because she's a fierce

52
00:03:03,488 --> 00:03:05,076
drag entertainer. Give me a spin too.

53
00:03:05,557 --> 00:03:07,863
Look at how gorgeous she looks.

54
00:03:07,863 --> 00:03:11,912
During season one, I had a lot of
insecurities. I was in my head

55
00:03:11,975 --> 00:03:14,569
three years, four
years after season one.

56
00:03:14,648 --> 00:03:17,619
I am still that
showgirl, powerhouse performer,

57
00:03:17,682 --> 00:03:19,451
mother of the house of Ding.

58
00:03:19,592 --> 00:03:23,434
If you remember Zimba Ding, that's my
drag daughter. She came from me.

59
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:24,730
She come from - she came?

60
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:25,755
Come, Came.

61
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:26,817
Cum.

62
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,480
Oh ho,

63
00:03:31,783 --> 00:03:32,593
Oh..

64
00:03:32,794 --> 00:03:33,981
it's a stick figure.

65
00:03:34,642 --> 00:03:36,075
She skimpy, she is tall!

66
00:03:44,826 --> 00:03:46,396
Wow. Fashion.

67
00:03:48,856 --> 00:03:50,603
I will do everything..

68
00:03:51,669 --> 00:03:52,331
everything..

69
00:03:53,303 --> 00:03:54,045
Give...

70
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:55,285
Give...

71
00:03:56,359 --> 00:03:57,027
Give...

72
00:03:57,982 --> 00:03:58,701
Give...

73
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:03,047
Girl, just stay your line and
move on so we can break for lunch.

74
00:04:03,308 --> 00:04:07,761
I am ready for it. I am ready
for the crown, Give me the crown!

75
00:04:16,009 --> 00:04:18,293
Hello everyone, my name is Siam Phusri.

76
00:04:18,352 --> 00:04:20,148
All the way from Thailand!

77
00:04:20,215 --> 00:04:22,672
Drag Race Thailand Season Three!

78
00:04:22,718 --> 00:04:24,257
She gave us the whole essay.

79
00:04:25,033 --> 00:04:25,682
Hello!

80
00:04:25,882 --> 00:04:28,808
I feel like the time that I jumped into
Drag Race Thailand, it seemed

81
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:30,588
like I can call like I'm
baby drag queen.

82
00:04:30,788 --> 00:04:34,064
So like the queen not really know anything
much because I just start

83
00:04:34,112 --> 00:04:37,627
doing drag. But now when I'm like
get to the show, I get more experience.

84
00:04:37,676 --> 00:04:39,120
So I feel like I'm an upgrade.

85
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:40,184
Are you ready?

86
00:04:40,764 --> 00:04:45,233
I want to be the best Asian drag
queen, and I will do anything to make my

87
00:04:45,294 --> 00:04:45,723
country

88
00:04:46,211 --> 00:04:47,019
proud.

89
00:04:51,831 --> 00:04:53,095
The devil is here girl!.

90
00:04:56,814 --> 00:04:57,656
I'm back!

91
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:00,329
Hello!

92
00:05:04,465 --> 00:05:09,407
Hello Ladies! Oh my God, this is
the national mouth of the Philippines

93
00:05:09,478 --> 00:05:13,927
once again, now with a fresher breath
of fresh air. Hahahaha...

94
00:05:14,155 --> 00:05:17,138
Viñas Deluxe, miss is it, Ladies.

95
00:05:17,358 --> 00:05:18,218
Gorgeous.

96
00:05:18,459 --> 00:05:19,961
Thank you, I've heard that.

97
00:05:21,062 --> 00:05:25,411
People remember me mostly because
of my Manananggaluk, which transcends

98
00:05:25,473 --> 00:05:29,760
in different culture and social
media, even if I can't understand what

99
00:05:29,822 --> 00:05:30,740
they're saying.

100
00:05:31,668 --> 00:05:35,349
I won in the design
challenge and then I went home in the

101
00:05:35,413 --> 00:05:38,514
design challenge. Oh my god,
what a coincidence!

102
00:05:38,574 --> 00:05:40,912
And I finished sixth place?

103
00:05:41,177 --> 00:05:42,636
Seventh? I don't know.

104
00:05:42,699 --> 00:05:44,120
I can't remember.

105
00:05:44,216 --> 00:05:45,648
Hello sis..

106
00:05:45,641 --> 00:05:46,932
Sister, my sister.

107
00:05:48,309 --> 00:05:48,932
How are you?

108
00:05:48,951 --> 00:05:49,581
I am good and you?

109
00:05:49,607 --> 00:05:52,168
Of course, I love seeing
Brigading again.

110
00:05:52,168 --> 00:05:54,732
It feels whole to see what
she will bring on the show. Of

111
00:05:54,777 --> 00:05:56,396
course, Viñas is a strong contender.

112
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:58,971
Tell us about your look.
This is fucking fierce, girl.

113
00:05:59,007 --> 00:06:03,098
Thank you. This is my favorite look from
my season. The manananggal look.

114
00:06:03,572 --> 00:06:05,417
So it's a half human,

115
00:06:05,785 --> 00:06:06,744
half human also.

116
00:06:07,641 --> 00:06:08,689
No, half human.

117
00:06:08,898 --> 00:06:11,906
I think she's one of
my biggest competition.

118
00:06:11,898 --> 00:06:14,886
Since we cater to the same
audience. Wow We're a catering service now.

119
00:06:14,935 --> 00:06:15,696
Wow, Catery!

120
00:06:18,141 --> 00:06:18,994
Oh my God!

121
00:06:19,076 --> 00:06:21,259
Oh, who's coming? I think
she's the tallest.

122
00:06:21,278 --> 00:06:22,341
She is the tallest.

123
00:06:22,358 --> 00:06:22,903
Yeah!

124
00:06:23,704 --> 00:06:26,670
Girl, we still have
tall Asian in the world.

125
00:06:26,788 --> 00:06:29,483
She has to have been mixed
with something that was very tall.

126
00:06:33,687 --> 00:06:37,780
Oh my god, oh my god, oh
my god, oh my god, oh my god!

127
00:06:39,002 --> 00:06:42,220
Hi, I'm Ivory Glaze. I'm
twenty-eight years old and I'm the Miss

128
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:45,237
Congeniality of RuPaul's Drag Race
Down Under Season Three.

129
00:06:45,588 --> 00:06:46,418
I'm so excited.

130
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:47,449
I think I could.

131
00:06:49,507 --> 00:06:52,256
Girl, don't die! The
season barely even started!

132
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:56,858
Fabulous! you got your airtime right
away Sis. That was quick.

133
00:06:56,891 --> 00:06:57,533
Need help?

134
00:06:57,559 --> 00:06:58,608
You all better lawyer up.

135
00:06:58,684 --> 00:07:02,314
I think that there's one thing
that fans remember about me and its

136
00:07:02,369 --> 00:07:05,559
definitely fainting. That
was a real fucking faint turing.

137
00:07:05,614 --> 00:07:07,759
Okay? Go check the tape, that was real.

138
00:07:07,742 --> 00:07:09,324
Do you need help or what?

139
00:07:09,523 --> 00:07:10,487
I did it this time.

140
00:07:10,509 --> 00:07:11,400
You did it this time

141
00:07:11,483 --> 00:07:12,667
You are alright?

142
00:07:12,925 --> 00:07:17,275
She is so tall. When someone is tall, doesn't
it mean they have a big... foot

143
00:07:17,526 --> 00:07:18,771
Her feet are big.

144
00:07:20,583 --> 00:07:23,196
Last time was an embarrassment and
I just need to prove everyone

145
00:07:23,237 --> 00:07:23,768
online wrong.

146
00:07:23,848 --> 00:07:25,110
I'm not doing it for me.

147
00:07:25,189 --> 00:07:26,872
I'm not doing it for my
friends and family.

148
00:07:27,112 --> 00:07:30,256
I'm doing it to spite the people online
that was talking shit about me.

149
00:07:30,499 --> 00:07:31,280
This is for you.

150
00:07:31,379 --> 00:07:32,641
I'm gonna get that crap bitch.

151
00:07:32,763 --> 00:07:34,963
Philippines, Thailand, China.

152
00:07:35,146 --> 00:07:36,473
Oh, you drag race China now.

153
00:07:37,881 --> 00:07:38,987
No. No, U. S. A. and China.

154
00:07:38,987 --> 00:07:39,704
Who are you?

155
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:40,627
I'm Chinese.

156
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:41,615
Are you really full Chinese?

157
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:42,394
Yes, I'm half Chinese.

158
00:07:42,429 --> 00:07:43,309
And what's the other half?

159
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:43,804
Dutch.

160
00:07:43,922 --> 00:07:46,949
I am fifty percent Chinese,
fifty percent Dutch, and one hundred

161
00:07:46,996 --> 00:07:49,454
percent gorgeous. My
mum's side is the Chinese side.

162
00:07:49,494 --> 00:07:52,653
I'm mixed, don't tell anyone. I'm
.. I am .. I am .. Asian.

163
00:07:52,797 --> 00:07:54,018
Okay, I'm still Asian.

164
00:07:54,059 --> 00:07:57,569
I'm the minority right now, David.
You better be nice to me.

165
00:08:01,596 --> 00:08:02,555
Isn't she adorable?

166
00:08:02,675 --> 00:08:03,341
So cute.

167
00:08:04,576 --> 00:08:07,627
The heigh difference is insane. One is
as tall as Kapre, then the other

168
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:09,302
one is like ... a really small person.

169
00:08:14,047 --> 00:08:15,418
Oh, adorable.

170
00:08:18,773 --> 00:08:20,521
Do you want me to get on top of you?

171
00:08:24,067 --> 00:08:27,895
Cheers everyone! Hiii!!! I'm Bernie
from Drag Race Philippines

172
00:08:27,957 --> 00:08:30,117
Season Two and one of the top four.

173
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:31,877
Did you miss me?

174
00:08:36,028 --> 00:08:41,247
During my season, I know, I had the best
runway. That's where I excel on

175
00:08:41,319 --> 00:08:42,116
the runway.

176
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:45,158
We're here!

177
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:46,768
Bernie.

178
00:08:46,842 --> 00:08:49,629
Baby, you're giving me
Nicki Minaj right now. I'm Yuhua.

179
00:08:49,726 --> 00:08:51,240
Nice to meet you.

180
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:52,310
Hello, sis.

181
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:55,693
She's season two sister, so I felt safe.

182
00:08:55,734 --> 00:09:01,388
I know she's going to be like
someone who I can rely on in the future.

183
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:03,092
Ahhhh... I said that right.

184
00:09:03,922 --> 00:09:06,118
Arizona is one of my...

185
00:09:06,226 --> 00:09:07,648
Actually, she's my best friend now.

186
00:09:07,729 --> 00:09:10,986
After our season, We have done
all our gigs and events

187
00:09:11,047 --> 00:09:12,977
together, we're always together.

188
00:09:12,977 --> 00:09:14,697
Oh, next girl! Come on, braids!

189
00:09:14,725 --> 00:09:15,417
Oh wow

190
00:09:15,442 --> 00:09:16,797
Come on, sequin.

191
00:09:31,962 --> 00:09:34,672
Did you prepare a big Asian buffet?

192
00:09:34,884 --> 00:09:36,485
Because I'm going to eat them all.

193
00:09:36,595 --> 00:09:37,475
Bon appétit.

194
00:09:40,187 --> 00:09:44,441
Hi, Cheers, it's Kitty Space.
Hello from Drag Race France Season Two.

195
00:09:47,091 --> 00:09:49,581
There's another accent. From France.

196
00:09:49,682 --> 00:09:51,908
We have Asian from France

197
00:09:52,226 --> 00:09:54,077
Joining competition. I feel like

198
00:09:54,447 --> 00:09:56,830
I want to learn fashion from her.

199
00:10:00,384 --> 00:10:01,533
Oh my god!

200
00:10:00,466 --> 00:10:01,491
Hello, HI!

201
00:10:01,692 --> 00:10:03,124
How are you?

202
00:10:01,834 --> 00:10:02,948
How are you?

203
00:10:03,149 --> 00:10:04,483
I am good.

204
00:10:04,484 --> 00:10:06,427
Yuhua. Nice to meet
you. What's your name, baby?

205
00:10:06,436 --> 00:10:08,395
Oh, hi., Kitty Space from France.

206
00:10:08,426 --> 00:10:09,614
Hi Brigiding.

207
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:14,493
I am really known in Paris for my
looks, like fashion and also

208
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:17,413
my campness. My season was like hard.

209
00:10:17,446 --> 00:10:19,932
I was not really
confident, but I was proud.

210
00:10:19,989 --> 00:10:20,836
You can't wait?

211
00:10:20,924 --> 00:10:22,980
Are you like, Filipino from France?

212
00:10:22,984 --> 00:10:24,498
No, I'm Vietnamese from France.

213
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:24,972
Oh Veitnamese

214
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:30,682
I was born in Vietnam, but I was adopted
by French parents, so the only

215
00:10:30,762 --> 00:10:33,889
Asian thing I have is where I was born.

216
00:10:33,908 --> 00:10:35,435
You were adopted when you were fifteen?

217
00:10:35,549 --> 00:10:37,071
No, fifteen months.

218
00:10:36,774 --> 00:10:37,691
Oh i see!

219
00:10:37,719 --> 00:10:38,914
Then I went to Canada,

220
00:10:38,933 --> 00:10:39,369
Okay

221
00:10:39,412 --> 00:10:40,610
and then France,

222
00:10:40,585 --> 00:10:41,054
Okay.

223
00:10:41,047 --> 00:10:45,404
and then China, and then
London, and then France, and then now.

224
00:10:45,663 --> 00:10:49,526
What's the French for
goodbye? Au revoir. Au revoir, Kitty

225
00:10:49,592 --> 00:10:51,657
Space. You said goodbye, right?

226
00:10:52,787 --> 00:10:54,648
Okay, we have another queen coming in.

227
00:10:59,623 --> 00:11:00,677
oh body?

228
00:11:03,108 --> 00:11:04,874
Oh, I think, I think...

229
00:11:10,907 --> 00:11:14,779
Sum Ting wicked
......... this way comes.

230
00:11:15,543 --> 00:11:22,159
Hello, my name is Sum Ting Wong and I'm from
the iconic Drag Race UK Season One.

231
00:11:23,504 --> 00:11:24,164
The best one.

232
00:11:24,326 --> 00:11:25,128
We started it all.

233
00:11:25,308 --> 00:11:26,412
But hello, how are you?

234
00:11:26,512 --> 00:11:27,087
It's me.

235
00:11:31,054 --> 00:11:32,389
Oh my god!

236
00:11:32,654 --> 00:11:35,292
She looks like a giant. She
is a little sweaty, isn't she?

237
00:11:36,379 --> 00:11:39,721
That was so nice.
Another giant woman up. Lovely.

238
00:11:39,725 --> 00:11:43,108
My name, obviously, the iconic Sum Ting
Wong. You can't have a Slaysian

239
00:11:43,155 --> 00:11:46,538
Royale without a slightly racist Chinese
name. These are all beautiful.

240
00:11:46,692 --> 00:11:48,354
Dude, these are all beauties

241
00:11:48,388 --> 00:11:49,980
Turn around for her

242
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:51,490
I am Chinese.

243
00:11:52,543 --> 00:11:56,660
I think my grandparents are Chinese, my
parents are Vietnamese because my

244
00:11:56,717 --> 00:12:00,496
grandparents moved to Vietnam but then
they moved to the UK because

245
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:01,624
of the Vietnam War.

246
00:12:01,716 --> 00:12:05,733
A bit wild but I know that my
blood is Chinese and my face is quite

247
00:12:05,793 --> 00:12:06,452
Asian so...

248
00:12:08,549 --> 00:12:09,158
Hello..

249
00:12:09,927 --> 00:12:13,696
I am the first Asian drag queen
to enter Drag Race UK, but this time

250
00:12:13,751 --> 00:12:17,741
I've been on this TV show before
and I will show you how to make a show.

251
00:12:17,998 --> 00:12:19,667
I'm the big uncle then.

252
00:12:19,706 --> 00:12:21,446
No, you're not the big uncle.

253
00:12:21,443 --> 00:12:24,733
Seeing her was like seeing a sister.
And she is chinese too.

254
00:12:24,788 --> 00:12:25,774
Relatable content.

255
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:34,714
Wow, she carried her luggage
to go home first.

256
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:47,234
Summer holidays, here I am.

257
00:12:48,164 --> 00:12:48,927
Joking!

258
00:12:49,128 --> 00:12:50,435
No, let's fight

259
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:52,157
for the crown!

260
00:12:55,806 --> 00:12:59,991
Hello, I am Madame Yoko. I am from
Drag Race Belgium Season Two.

261
00:13:00,134 --> 00:13:02,919
And as we say in my language, Hello.

262
00:13:04,582 --> 00:13:07,065
Hello girls, how are you doing?

263
00:13:07,226 --> 00:13:11,812
So my strength during the season was the
fact that I was so friendly with

264
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:16,398
the other girls and because I am a singer,
so I did sing a lot and well.

265
00:13:22,942 --> 00:13:24,576
I can't go higher than that.

266
00:13:24,624 --> 00:13:27,988
What the hell are you doing here?
Dont unpack, go back girl.

267
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:31,296
I will put you in the suitcase
to go back home.

268
00:13:31,321 --> 00:13:34,191
I never met her before but we talked
a lot on social media and

269
00:13:34,237 --> 00:13:36,042
she speaks French, she's Belgian but...

270
00:13:36,643 --> 00:13:39,209
She will be my French friend.

271
00:13:39,249 --> 00:13:41,793
It's good to have
someone who speaks French.

272
00:13:41,874 --> 00:13:43,096
Nice to meet you. I know you.

273
00:13:43,138 --> 00:13:44,360
Oh, I know you!

274
00:13:45,763 --> 00:13:50,028
I am like a mix of Asian
culture because I was born in Vietnam.

275
00:13:50,105 --> 00:13:52,494
Well, I was adopted when
I was very young.

276
00:13:52,528 --> 00:13:56,311
I arrived in Belgium when I
was three and a half and I grew up

277
00:13:56,372 --> 00:13:58,812
with my Belgian parents for all my life.

278
00:13:58,812 --> 00:14:00,214
Girl, we missed your name.
What's your name?

279
00:14:00,234 --> 00:14:01,344
Madame Yoko.

280
00:14:01,374 --> 00:14:03,696
I heard that in
Filipino, Yoko means I don't like.

281
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:04,594
You don't like?

282
00:14:06,376 --> 00:14:08,789
She looks like a veteran drag queen.

283
00:14:09,119 --> 00:14:10,341
I see it on the face.

284
00:14:13,918 --> 00:14:15,274
another one is arriving.

285
00:14:15,304 --> 00:14:16,191
Come on, Heels.

286
00:14:16,249 --> 00:14:16,841
Yeah, yes.

287
00:14:17,202 --> 00:14:17,866
Wow.

288
00:14:22,647 --> 00:14:23,751
Oh my god damn it.

289
00:14:29,498 --> 00:14:30,821
Mother doll has arrived.

290
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:32,236
Kisses!

291
00:14:34,643 --> 00:14:38,660
How are you doing? I am Suki Doll, from
Canada's Drag Race Season Two,

292
00:14:38,718 --> 00:14:40,210
as your Miss Congeniality.

293
00:14:40,707 --> 00:14:41,534
Werk!

294
00:14:43,774 --> 00:14:45,179
Oh my God, you're alive!

295
00:14:46,262 --> 00:14:49,969
I think in my season there's not a lot
of regrets because I don't live

296
00:14:50,022 --> 00:14:53,517
with regrets, but there's things that
I want to do differently and

297
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:55,741
to do even better, even
more fashionably.

298
00:14:56,102 --> 00:14:57,182
But which Asian are you?

299
00:14:57,323 --> 00:14:58,565
I'm all of the Asians.

300
00:14:58,605 --> 00:15:01,652
I'm Vietnamese, Chinese, Cambodian
and French-Canadian.

301
00:15:01,825 --> 00:15:03,467
Can you hear this, come on.

302
00:15:03,509 --> 00:15:06,798
I speak Vietnamese,
French, English and Spanish.

303
00:15:06,844 --> 00:15:10,407
So I do have a lot of mixture. So
I really want to showcase my

304
00:15:10,464 --> 00:15:14,258
heritage and the richness of my roots
to everyone that is in Asia.

305
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:16,284
It's warm in here.

306
00:15:20,229 --> 00:15:21,143
She's from the future.

307
00:15:21,172 --> 00:15:22,522
I think she's horny.

308
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,448
Is she? She is spiky.

309
00:15:33,649 --> 00:15:34,873
Come on

310
00:15:35,106 --> 00:15:36,600
I can't tell if it was like

311
00:15:37,003 --> 00:15:37,979
Oh, it's Khianna.

312
00:15:38,023 --> 00:15:40,951
I know her season was
like, what, three minutes ago?

313
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:45,408
Her walk was giving so much attitude,
like, good attitude.

314
00:15:45,455 --> 00:15:47,610
That's what makes a queen.

315
00:15:49,731 --> 00:15:50,656
Round two.

316
00:15:52,042 --> 00:15:53,027
Fight.

317
00:15:56,735 --> 00:15:58,552
Surprise-Mama Pao!

318
00:15:58,568 --> 00:16:02,104
It's me. It's I, the
i-kionic , the most, the best,

319
00:16:02,523 --> 00:16:04,254
and I am your first runner-up.

320
00:16:05,303 --> 00:16:07,639
of Season Three, Drag Race Philippines.

321
00:16:08,464 --> 00:16:10,549
The most iconic season.

322
00:16:14,243 --> 00:16:19,462
Back in season three, I was known for
like my stunts, my tricks, my

323
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:21,955
lip sync, my fashion, my looks,

324
00:16:22,253 --> 00:16:23,575
and most importantly,

325
00:16:24,198 --> 00:16:25,347
my kind heart.

326
00:16:25,879 --> 00:16:27,841
You're on top, it's
just because of your look.

327
00:16:30,858 --> 00:16:31,879
What now , fucker?

328
00:16:31,512 --> 00:16:33,036
Oh, my God.

329
00:16:35,302 --> 00:16:37,005
She's my fellow runner-up.

330
00:16:37,086 --> 00:16:39,770
So I think both of us have
something to prove.

331
00:16:39,817 --> 00:16:42,695
Not just to each
other, but to ourselves.

332
00:16:42,727 --> 00:16:43,817
Hello, I'm Ivory.

333
00:16:43,832 --> 00:16:45,392
Gosh, this one is handsome.

334
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:46,374
Are you blusing?

335
00:16:46,403 --> 00:16:49,908
Well, I did really expect to
win, but I kinda wanted Maxie to win

336
00:16:49,962 --> 00:16:53,467
also because I know that she is that
bitch. And I look up to her.

337
00:16:53,568 --> 00:16:57,709
What I felt when I lost, just like
how Versex said it, Breakdown a minute,

338
00:16:57,765 --> 00:17:00,115
jerk off the next,
then bounce right back.

339
00:17:01,653 --> 00:17:06,332
Oh my god! I love that all of us are Asians
and we're representing something.

340
00:17:06,441 --> 00:17:07,523
There's so many languages.

341
00:17:10,253 --> 00:17:12,650
This mix of bitches did not
come here to go home.

342
00:17:12,871 --> 00:17:14,935
And there is every type of drag here.

343
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:18,881
I was quite impressed by the
quality of their looks.

344
00:17:18,943 --> 00:17:23,170
Think about when you go to buffet place.
This is the best buffet place in

345
00:17:23,228 --> 00:17:23,808
the world.

346
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:28,739
If you want dim sum, you have
some. But the best fruit in the world is

347
00:17:28,807 --> 00:17:29,694
papaya salad.

348
00:17:35,479 --> 00:17:36,631
Where's that coming from though?

349
00:17:40,751 --> 00:17:41,954
Cheers Everyone!

350
00:17:44,783 --> 00:17:50,632
Mama Ru, oh my god, you again, but on
TV, but not here. What happened?

351
00:17:50,914 --> 00:17:55,141
Welcome to Drag Race Philippines
Slaysian Royale.

352
00:17:56,523 --> 00:18:01,533
It's time to shine like
only a true Asian sensation can.

353
00:18:01,694 --> 00:18:03,857
From Luzon to Mindanao.

354
00:18:04,158 --> 00:18:06,282
From Bangkok to Hanoi.

355
00:18:07,023 --> 00:18:12,429
Work the world, and prove that
you've got what it takes to battle Royale.

356
00:18:12,971 --> 00:18:17,096
So show us your charisma, uniqueness,
nerve, and talent,

357
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:19,379
and may the best Slaysian win.

358
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:25,850
Season one, baby!

359
00:18:24,216 --> 00:18:25,677
Oh my God!

360
00:18:25,878 --> 00:18:27,107
Oh, my God!

361
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:35,420
Who's that?

362
00:18:38,486 --> 00:18:40,381
Oh my god, it's Mama Pao.

363
00:18:40,409 --> 00:18:43,726
I've watched all the Philippine
seasons and she's always so much fun and

364
00:18:43,772 --> 00:18:47,180
like she seems to really know and
engage with the girls. I'm so excited to

365
00:18:47,226 --> 00:18:47,640
meet her.

366
00:18:48,763 --> 00:18:50,084
Hello, hello, hello!

367
00:18:50,745 --> 00:18:52,267
Hello, anybody home?

368
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:54,071
Mabuheeey!

369
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:56,658
And welcome to an
extra special season of

370
00:18:56,847 --> 00:19:01,254
Drag Race Philippines Slaysian Royale!

371
00:19:02,654 --> 00:19:06,565
Thank you for joining us in making
drag race "herstory".

372
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:12,322
For the first time ever, we are
uniting the fiercest Asian queens from across

373
00:19:12,397 --> 00:19:15,970
the globe to celebrate the
beauty, artistry, and

374
00:19:16,045 --> 00:19:18,352
undeniable power of Asian drag.

375
00:19:18,704 --> 00:19:25,172
And where better to do it than
right here in the land of fierce fiestas,

376
00:19:25,262 --> 00:19:31,371
karaoke battles, and hair as high as
our standards, the Philippines!

377
00:19:32,183 --> 00:19:36,516
Each week, you will be pushed to the limit
with challenges that will test

378
00:19:36,576 --> 00:19:39,247
your charisma,
uniqueness, nerve, and talent.

379
00:19:39,468 --> 00:19:44,117
And at the end of it all, one
queen will snatch a year's supply of

380
00:19:44,187 --> 00:19:48,765
Anastasia Beverly Hills
cosmetics and a jaw-dropping prize of two

381
00:19:48,835 --> 00:19:49,821
million pesos!

382
00:19:52,619 --> 00:19:54,260
Powered by Bingo Plus.

383
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,802
Bingo for the fun, plus for the win!

384
00:19:56,918 --> 00:20:01,130
Werk! Oh my gosh, the prize money
is two million pesos.

385
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:05,118
So that's twice the original season's
jackpot prize money.

386
00:20:05,253 --> 00:20:07,435
In France, we don't have
money prize, so...

387
00:20:07,575 --> 00:20:09,599
Can I get this two million pesos?

388
00:20:09,649 --> 00:20:12,408
Like, I need money
for outfit. Thank you.

389
00:20:12,703 --> 00:20:17,777
And of course, the ultimate honour of
becoming the very first Slaysian

390
00:20:17,849 --> 00:20:18,937
Drag Superstar!

391
00:20:18,973 --> 00:20:19,773
So, my queens...

392
00:20:21,456 --> 00:20:24,478
Are you ready to show
the world how Asians slay?

393
00:20:27,308 --> 00:20:30,574
Then let the slay off begin!

394
00:20:35,904 --> 00:20:40,198
The winner of Drag Race Philippines Slaysian
Royale will receive a one-year

395
00:20:40,255 --> 00:20:43,633
supply of Anastasia Beverly Hills
cosmetics, a coveted spot

396
00:20:43,691 --> 00:20:47,298
on the Drag Race Slaysian Hall of
Fame, and a cash prize of two

397
00:20:47,355 --> 00:20:49,474
million pesos, powered by Bingo Plus.

398
00:20:49,574 --> 00:20:54,294
Tonight with our extra
special guest judges, Maxi and Jimbo.

399
00:21:08,369 --> 00:21:12,981
For your first mini
challenge, you will go hair to hair

400
00:21:13,065 --> 00:21:16,419
in our Hairyography Dance Battle Royale.

401
00:21:16,494 --> 00:21:20,878
Brought to you by Cream Silk, the
number one haircare brand in the Philippines.

402
00:21:21,139 --> 00:21:25,321
I'm so excited because it's a dancing
again challenge. So, my God!

403
00:21:26,367 --> 00:21:27,343
My God! Exciting.

404
00:21:27,543 --> 00:21:31,782
In this challenge, you will face
off in a dance showdown where flipping

405
00:21:31,842 --> 00:21:34,170
that gorgeous, luscious hair is a must.

406
00:21:34,231 --> 00:21:38,376
Let's see how you whip it and show
us what strong hair can do.

407
00:21:38,475 --> 00:21:42,448
Now, the queen who serves the fiercest
moves will win a cash tip

408
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:44,062
of twenty thousand pesos.

409
00:21:44,882 --> 00:21:48,659
But who will be judging? Please
welcome a true modern

410
00:21:48,731 --> 00:21:50,869
Filipino icon and trailblazer.

411
00:21:51,029 --> 00:21:55,383
Give it up for the one-woman wonder,
Mrs. Jervie Wrightson

412
00:21:55,458 --> 00:21:56,434
, KaladKaren!

413
00:21:58,816 --> 00:22:01,533
Hi, Slaysian Queen!

414
00:22:03,021 --> 00:22:04,391
Lets blow this shit up!

415
00:22:04,703 --> 00:22:08,804
Jervie and I will be judging your
dance-offs, queens. Let the

416
00:22:08,871 --> 00:22:11,695
showdown begin with Arizona
and Siam Puzi!

417
00:22:12,295 --> 00:22:14,136
Let's go! Let's go, peeps!

418
00:22:19,502 --> 00:22:19,979
Aye.

419
00:22:20,743 --> 00:22:23,283
Flip that hair, queens.

420
00:22:29,327 --> 00:22:33,492
Arizona mama pulled off the
ponytail, split it in half, started swinging

421
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:36,037
like a cheerleader.
She was giving her all.

422
00:22:36,339 --> 00:22:37,338
Werk it out, girl.

423
00:22:39,216 --> 00:22:41,715
All the hair were really, like messy.

424
00:22:41,787 --> 00:22:44,195
And then I feel like I need to
keep going, going, because

425
00:22:44,237 --> 00:22:45,293
it's looking bad already.

426
00:22:45,333 --> 00:22:47,265
Like, just keep going, girl.

427
00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:49,046
Cheer leader.

428
00:22:50,783 --> 00:22:53,308
Bernie and Madame Yoko.

429
00:22:54,383 --> 00:22:56,181
She might break her neck.

430
00:23:01,167 --> 00:23:05,297
And under this wig cap there was something
else and obviously yeah it

431
00:23:05,356 --> 00:23:06,135
was stunning.

432
00:23:10,823 --> 00:23:14,031
Like hell, girls from
Philippines, they know how to do it.

433
00:23:14,757 --> 00:23:17,110
Brigiding and Kitty Space.

434
00:23:20,338 --> 00:23:23,693
I was flipping my hair like cha-cha-cha-cha
and then I do

435
00:23:23,751 --> 00:23:24,575
the cartwheel.

436
00:23:27,503 --> 00:23:30,715
Actually, I was so amazed with Brigiding.
Its been a while since I

437
00:23:30,764 --> 00:23:34,317
have seen her do these steps. She
was really fighting. There's no holding

438
00:23:34,366 --> 00:23:34,852
back here.

439
00:23:34,974 --> 00:23:37,417
Now, Khianna and Suki Doll!

440
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,170
hey.. hey.. Woo.. Woo..

441
00:23:44,362 --> 00:23:46,428
Khianna, she gave us hair.

442
00:23:46,488 --> 00:23:47,391
She was splitting.

443
00:23:47,552 --> 00:23:48,494
She gave her all.

444
00:23:49,257 --> 00:23:50,440
Move your hair, bitch!

445
00:23:56,530 --> 00:23:58,237
Go, Queen! Yeah!

446
00:23:59,511 --> 00:24:00,840
Not legal.

447
00:24:01,085 --> 00:24:03,269
I remember it's a hair flip challenge.

448
00:24:03,409 --> 00:24:05,052
We're trying to keep our wigs on.

449
00:24:05,372 --> 00:24:08,417
But that was funny to see a fashion
queen losing her wig.

450
00:24:08,537 --> 00:24:10,399
Yuhua and Viñas!

451
00:24:14,477 --> 00:24:16,043
Go Yuhua!

452
00:24:17,693 --> 00:24:19,994
I just gave it all, I got on my knees.

453
00:24:23,619 --> 00:24:26,161
I pulled my ponytail as if
I'm giving a blowjob.

454
00:24:26,531 --> 00:24:27,610
Go, Bitch!

455
00:24:30,257 --> 00:24:31,969
That hair flip was beautiful.

456
00:24:32,082 --> 00:24:33,462
Sis, that was a Cream Silk moment.

457
00:24:33,662 --> 00:24:34,967
Just like this... Cream Silk.

458
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:41,815
I didn't expect to get so dizzy!

459
00:24:42,565 --> 00:24:44,689
Ivory Glaze and Sum Ting Wong.

460
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:46,118
I'm with my sweaty sister.

461
00:24:46,223 --> 00:24:49,438
All right, get your mops
out, girls, because there's about

462
00:24:49,493 --> 00:24:51,212
to be water all over the floor.

463
00:24:51,318 --> 00:24:52,639
Yes!

464
00:24:54,949 --> 00:24:55,522
We are

465
00:24:56,003 --> 00:24:59,974
Two majestic, beautiful angels
dancing on this stage.

466
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:02,462
You cannot tell us anything.

467
00:25:06,721 --> 00:25:07,892
I did the hair flick.

468
00:25:08,214 --> 00:25:11,360
And the hair did the hair flick. I did the
challenge. The hair went flipping.

469
00:25:11,781 --> 00:25:12,282
Yeah.

470
00:25:12,783 --> 00:25:16,108
Whoa, from beautiful to handsome.

471
00:25:22,045 --> 00:25:26,810
All the girls were fabulous, and I can
say you deserve a lot of money.

472
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:33,910
Let's go!

473
00:25:34,443 --> 00:25:37,279
Let's go. Oh, wow. Oh, my God.

474
00:25:39,162 --> 00:25:42,748
Oh my god, the new werkroom is so big!

475
00:25:42,764 --> 00:25:44,611
I like big things!

476
00:25:45,873 --> 00:25:46,745
Oh my god! Ahhhh!

477
00:25:49,274 --> 00:25:50,116
We're here!

478
00:25:51,041 --> 00:25:53,906
Oh my gosh, I'm here again, guys.

479
00:25:54,203 --> 00:25:55,383
I take a deep breath

480
00:25:56,129 --> 00:26:01,354
And I told myself this is the
place for me to come and enjoy the time.

481
00:26:01,376 --> 00:26:06,601
I'm gonna make the best of me. To be the
best version on this competition.

482
00:26:09,534 --> 00:26:11,157
Am I disturbing you?

483
00:26:12,276 --> 00:26:13,736
You all look so different.

484
00:26:13,736 --> 00:26:16,045
Look at this handsome man!

485
00:26:16,423 --> 00:26:20,616
Now it's time to crown the
very first hairography champion.

486
00:26:20,857 --> 00:26:22,621
The winner of today's challenge is

487
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:25,815
Khianna!

488
00:26:25,858 --> 00:26:26,803
I told you.

489
00:26:28,004 --> 00:26:31,966
Oh my god, um, no biggie, you know me.

490
00:26:32,543 --> 00:26:34,530
Khianna with a K, she is that girl.

491
00:26:37,908 --> 00:26:40,600
Khianna with a K, come here.
Condragulations!

492
00:26:40,626 --> 00:26:41,930
Was I surprised?

493
00:26:41,971 --> 00:26:46,962
No. She gave us hairography. She gave
us swings. She gave us dips.

494
00:26:47,369 --> 00:26:52,003
Kiana really deserves the win because she
mopped the stage with her opponent.

495
00:26:52,063 --> 00:26:54,772
"Nilampaso" in
English, she mopped her enemy.

496
00:26:56,402 --> 00:27:00,611
You have won a cash tip of twenty thousand
pesos from Cream Silk! The

497
00:27:00,672 --> 00:27:03,477
number one hair care brand
in the Philippines.

498
00:27:03,819 --> 00:27:05,221
Thank you. Thank you, Cream Silk.

499
00:27:05,783 --> 00:27:08,453
Kiana is really a
strong, strong performer.

500
00:27:08,524 --> 00:27:11,497
It's funny because she's the youngest
among us, so she have the

501
00:27:11,544 --> 00:27:14,705
most energy and hunger! She was also
in the Top 2 of her season, so

502
00:27:14,752 --> 00:27:16,450
there is a lot at stake for Khianna.

503
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:21,074
And now, my queens, it's time for
your first maxi challenge.

504
00:27:21,101 --> 00:27:25,068
For this challenge, you'll be
stepping into the spotlight and competing in

505
00:27:25,122 --> 00:27:25,658
a pageant.

506
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:26,678
Yes.

507
00:27:26,859 --> 00:27:29,989
In Miss Shutacca Slaysian Edition!

508
00:27:34,466 --> 00:27:35,806
We love pageants.

509
00:27:35,868 --> 00:27:37,349
It's our Olympics.

510
00:27:37,408 --> 00:27:39,184
Like, it's really big here.

511
00:27:39,231 --> 00:27:43,415
I'm happy and I'm glad. I feel like
this is what I'm good at. And

512
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,798
I am a Miss Gaba from San Francisco.

513
00:27:45,798 --> 00:27:49,722
I'm the best Asian in San
Francisco in 2022.

514
00:27:50,183 --> 00:27:53,947
First up, we have
national costume extravaganza.

515
00:27:55,177 --> 00:27:56,402
Oh my god!

516
00:27:56,739 --> 00:28:00,030
Next, you have to prepare to dazzle
in evening gown eleganza.

517
00:28:00,334 --> 00:28:01,275
And, of course,

518
00:28:01,712 --> 00:28:04,014
a gag-worthy ruveal.

519
00:28:04,116 --> 00:28:05,775
Right, Viñas?

520
00:28:07,418 --> 00:28:10,427
And finally, what's a
pageant without a little pressure?

521
00:28:11,001 --> 00:28:11,941
Yes, queens.

522
00:28:12,704 --> 00:28:15,532
My question and answer portion.

523
00:28:15,822 --> 00:28:16,745
Oh my goodness.

524
00:28:16,967 --> 00:28:20,170
You have thirty
seconds to serve with wisdom

525
00:28:20,764 --> 00:28:21,847
and world peace.

526
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:24,933
Now, as the winner of our
mini challenge, Khianna with a C.

527
00:28:25,324 --> 00:28:25,983
hm hmm...

528
00:28:26,183 --> 00:28:29,132
You have the advantage of having
an additional five

529
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:31,561
seconds in the
question and answer round.

530
00:28:32,363 --> 00:28:35,264
I feel like the five seconds, is
not really an advantage to me because

531
00:28:35,306 --> 00:28:36,880
I feel like I won't be able to answer.

532
00:28:38,266 --> 00:28:39,987
Raise your hand if you are dumb!

533
00:28:41,008 --> 00:28:42,149
But?

534
00:28:43,402 --> 00:28:47,909
You can also take five seconds away from
another queen for her question

535
00:28:47,973 --> 00:28:48,988
and answer time.

536
00:28:48,988 --> 00:28:49,664
we are in trouble.

537
00:28:49,869 --> 00:28:54,320
Now, Khianna, who do you
choose to give that disadvantage?

538
00:28:54,338 --> 00:28:55,553
Oh, my God.

539
00:28:55,587 --> 00:28:56,732
I don't even know.

540
00:28:56,767 --> 00:28:57,736
You only have five seconds.

541
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:59,473
Five, four, three.

542
00:28:59,579 --> 00:29:00,479
Wait, wait, wait.

543
00:29:01,261 --> 00:29:02,330
I was looking.

544
00:29:02,924 --> 00:29:05,398
To my international girlies,
I was like...

545
00:29:06,117 --> 00:29:10,860
I cannot pick their name first because
I want them to feel welcome.

546
00:29:11,783 --> 00:29:15,310
I'm gonna challenge my first
runner-up sister.

547
00:29:16,291 --> 00:29:16,782
Who?

548
00:29:17,324 --> 00:29:18,853
Arizona Bandy?

549
00:29:18,896 --> 00:29:22,161
So you're taking away, five
seconds away from her.

550
00:29:22,219 --> 00:29:22,727
Yes.

551
00:29:23,565 --> 00:29:27,852
She picked Arizona. Are the Filipina
queens gonna fight?

552
00:29:27,968 --> 00:29:30,873
They were both Top 2 in their original
seasons. May be bit of

553
00:29:30,921 --> 00:29:31,493
rivary here?

554
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:33,069
I was gobsmacked.

555
00:29:33,315 --> 00:29:33,975
ahh...

556
00:29:34,175 --> 00:29:38,580
Because I thought we were
sisters. I thought Filipino queens will be

557
00:29:38,645 --> 00:29:41,236
sticking together this time. I was so...

558
00:29:41,546 --> 00:29:44,502
What are other deep fancy
words for "shock"?

559
00:29:45,302 --> 00:29:47,165
I was flabbergasted.

560
00:29:47,185 --> 00:29:51,913
The competition is just getting started,
so slay resplendently, my

561
00:29:51,985 --> 00:29:53,131
Slaysian queens.

562
00:29:54,093 --> 00:29:55,395
Resplendently.

563
00:29:56,176 --> 00:29:57,497
Good luck and ?

564
00:30:01,602 --> 00:30:03,300
So sister, I have a question to ask you.

565
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:03,862
Yep.

566
00:30:03,846 --> 00:30:04,946
Why did you choose her?

567
00:30:05,024 --> 00:30:05,648
Alright.

568
00:30:05,773 --> 00:30:08,193
Because your answer was very vague.

569
00:30:08,427 --> 00:30:09,159
Vague?

570
00:30:09,197 --> 00:30:12,539
Usually people have alliances within
their own countries. I know.

571
00:30:12,591 --> 00:30:14,441
And you picked her out of all of us.

572
00:30:14,943 --> 00:30:18,108
I don't know, like, it was just more
of like, I know she's going

573
00:30:18,157 --> 00:30:20,136
to understand why I'm going to pick her.

574
00:30:20,236 --> 00:30:22,202
The funny thing is actually...

575
00:30:22,556 --> 00:30:24,889
I always get compared to the runner-ups.

576
00:30:24,933 --> 00:30:27,782
It's Khianna and Marina Summers.

577
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,459
That made me sad. I thought.

578
00:30:29,741 --> 00:30:31,510
Don't they know,

579
00:30:31,842 --> 00:30:34,431
the struggle Arizona went through
during our season?

580
00:30:35,135 --> 00:30:36,722
And to this day...

581
00:30:37,314 --> 00:30:39,705
she continues to push herself even more.

582
00:30:39,766 --> 00:30:42,511
A lot of people were saying,
I'm not on the same level as the

583
00:30:42,556 --> 00:30:44,221
runner-ups. The runner-ups are on the

584
00:30:44,642 --> 00:30:48,659
international level, and
Arizona's just the one who ate her lenses.

585
00:30:49,206 --> 00:30:53,436
Just because I do comedy, just because
I ate my contacts, okay

586
00:30:53,505 --> 00:30:55,416
and licked the floor. Haahaa

587
00:30:55,625 --> 00:30:57,751
Does that mean my drag isn't excellent?

588
00:30:57,843 --> 00:31:00,354
Because that's the message I'm getting.

589
00:31:00,823 --> 00:31:03,786
The fans, you, know, the fans
are crazy for that.

590
00:31:03,814 --> 00:31:05,360
But it's okay, I think.

591
00:31:05,882 --> 00:31:08,459
I'm gonna have vindication on the stage.

592
00:31:08,848 --> 00:31:11,774
And yeah, it's also a compliment
because...

593
00:31:11,886 --> 00:31:12,425
It is.

594
00:31:12,533 --> 00:31:13,814
You are competition.

595
00:31:13,882 --> 00:31:14,358
Yeah.

596
00:31:14,579 --> 00:31:16,261
And it's good. It's good
to be competition.

597
00:31:17,183 --> 00:31:19,469
I'm good. I'm just shocked.

598
00:31:19,457 --> 00:31:19,829
Yeah.

599
00:31:20,029 --> 00:31:21,398
There's no lipstick yet
but you're like..

600
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:22,024
I'm gobsmacked.

601
00:31:22,042 --> 00:31:23,928
Its Drag Race, girl, ofcourse
you will be shocked.

602
00:31:24,008 --> 00:31:25,698
And I understand what she did.

603
00:31:26,315 --> 00:31:27,139
ahhhh

604
00:31:27,564 --> 00:31:30,051
I forgave her for what she did,

605
00:31:30,717 --> 00:31:32,267
but I won't forget.

606
00:31:32,908 --> 00:31:34,511
It's gonna be in my mind.

607
00:31:34,582 --> 00:31:37,125
Watch out for me, Sis, Kidding.

608
00:31:50,534 --> 00:31:54,198
It's a brand new day in the werkroom,
baby. And we are ready

609
00:31:54,259 --> 00:31:54,809
for what?

610
00:31:55,082 --> 00:31:56,716
Miss Shutacca, baby!

611
00:31:56,975 --> 00:32:00,580
Oh my god, I will be in a pageant. This
is my first time. I just look

612
00:32:00,632 --> 00:32:03,715
like I join pageants, but I never
really. I am just a girl.

613
00:32:03,767 --> 00:32:04,237
A Latina!

614
00:32:04,303 --> 00:32:06,091
But when was your
first time to go to Vietnam?

615
00:32:06,696 --> 00:32:08,466
I was twelve years old.

616
00:32:08,507 --> 00:32:09,726
12 years? What about you?

617
00:32:09,733 --> 00:32:13,242
And I was older, way older was like
almost twenty, twenty-three

618
00:32:13,298 --> 00:32:13,744
I think.

619
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:14,305
Oh really?

620
00:32:14,298 --> 00:32:16,202
And how do you feel when you go there?

621
00:32:16,581 --> 00:32:19,642
Did you feel like you're going
to go back to that country? or No.

622
00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:23,741
No. For me, it was a journey with
my adoptive parents. Well, my parents.

623
00:32:24,467 --> 00:32:28,527
I had some issues when I was a
teenager because you know once you're a

624
00:32:28,585 --> 00:32:32,413
teenager you are looking for who you
are and I thought at the time

625
00:32:32,471 --> 00:32:36,416
that maybe my roots back to
Vietnam would help me to find who I was.

626
00:32:36,476 --> 00:32:41,194
But for me it was when I when I landed
in Hanoi with my parents. I...

627
00:32:41,622 --> 00:32:43,745
I came out of the gates of the airport.

628
00:32:43,756 --> 00:32:48,001
I didn't recognize myself into
the faces I could see,

629
00:32:48,181 --> 00:32:50,048
you know, like I didn't connect.

630
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:55,367
And I discovered that I was not
a real Vietnamese guy in my heart,

631
00:32:55,446 --> 00:32:57,256
but more a Belgian one.

632
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:58,735
So I felt like, okay,

633
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:02,739
okay , the answer to
all your teenager's issues

634
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:06,962
ahh ... Teenage
issues, problems, is not here.

635
00:33:07,283 --> 00:33:10,739
You have to find the
answers back in Belgium because

636
00:33:11,588 --> 00:33:16,218
I think you are a real
European guy, loving beer, Belgian beer

637
00:33:16,292 --> 00:33:18,383
and Belgian fries, you know?

638
00:33:18,574 --> 00:33:19,439
It was kind of

639
00:33:19,827 --> 00:33:21,041
a relief for me.

640
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,469
I was, I felt...

641
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:28,452
Really comfortable to see
someone else who is Asian adopted.

642
00:33:28,452 --> 00:33:29,944
And I was really touched by

643
00:33:30,263 --> 00:33:34,208
Yoko because, you know, I can
feel myself in her story.

644
00:33:34,423 --> 00:33:39,410
Well being part of Slaysian Royale is
proud moment for me because for

645
00:33:39,482 --> 00:33:42,302
me feeling like going back to the roots

646
00:33:43,402 --> 00:33:48,253

already know that I will enjoy this season

647

And I thank you.

698
00:36:46,233 --> 00:36:47,075
Bernie.

699
00:36:47,584 --> 00:36:51,516
A glorious evening to each and everyone.
Standing in front of you,

700
00:36:51,576 --> 00:36:52,946
is a nineteen and fresh

701
00:36:53,584 --> 00:36:59,693
year old stunner, who hails at Mandaluyong
City? And I believe

702
00:36:59,792 --> 00:37:03,240
in the saying, "If beauty is a sin,

703
00:37:03,876 --> 00:37:06,537
then allow me to plead guilty. "

704
00:37:07,173 --> 00:37:08,289
I am sorry.

705
00:37:08,923 --> 00:37:10,407
Thank you so much.

706
00:37:12,372 --> 00:37:13,785
Sum ting Wong.

707
00:37:14,466 --> 00:37:20,671
Hello, I am Miss Sum ting Wong, representing
drag race, United Kingdom.

708
00:37:20,731 --> 00:37:25,861
And I stand here before as a
child of immigration, fortunate enough

709
00:37:25,938 --> 00:37:31,298
to represent the United Kingdom
and all of its drag on a global stage.

710
00:37:31,318 --> 00:37:33,780
And for that, I say, I
love you long time.

711
00:37:34,541 --> 00:37:35,041
Thank you.

712
00:37:36,001 --> 00:37:37,640
Arizona Brandy!

713
00:37:37,825 --> 00:37:42,778
Standing right in front of you, the
one and only, Arizona Brandy!

00:37:43,532 --> 00:37:47,568
Representing Drag Race Philippines
Season Two!

715
00:37:48,811 --> 00:37:51,200
Leaving you with these wise words ...

716
00:37:51,309 --> 00:37:55,120
(In Tagalog) "Aanhin mo ang
isang kilo ng gulay, kung mas mura

717
00:37:55,181 --> 00:37:57,148
naman ang isang bote ng tagay? "

718
00:37:57,227 --> 00:38:01,966
In English, what will you do
with a kilo of vegetable if a bottle

719
00:38:02,039 --> 00:38:04,153
of liquor is more affordable?

720
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:04,961
And I,

721
00:38:05,562 --> 00:38:06,345
thank you!

722
00:38:09,428 --> 00:38:10,803
Ivory Glaze.

723
00:38:11,745 --> 00:38:15,862
G'day everyone, my name is Ivory Glaze

I am, mind-your-business years old and
my life motto is never leave a

726
00:38:21,672 --> 00:38:22,595
dick unsucked.

727
00:38:22,936 --> 00:38:25,318
Thank you very much and

728
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:28,412
Viñas Deluxe.

729
00:38:28,782 --> 00:38:32,952
Cheers, Cheers everyone. Tiny things that
die, with the touch of these hands.

730
00:38:33,007 --> 00:38:35,064
Oh my, will stand up again and say hi.

731
00:38:35,521 --> 00:38:37,390
My name is Viñas Deluxe.

732
00:38:37,456 --> 00:38:43,610
Queens, there's no time to relax.
The boys be gagged, this mouth's Deluxe.

733
00:38:43,694 --> 00:38:47,936
So let the packed be
unboxed, because I love cocks!

734
00:38:48,104 --> 00:38:49,149
Shucks!

735
00:38:50,407 --> 00:38:52,160

Hello, everyone.

00:38:53,783 --> 00:38:58,845
My name is Siam Phusri from Drag

738
00:39:00,128 --> 00:39:03,671
I'm here to celebrate LGBT

739
00:39:03,729 --> 00:39:05,472
in Thailand already right now.

740
00:39:05,693 --> 00:39:08,834
Hopefully, it will be all
around the world.

741
00:39:09,215 --> 00:39:12,258
Everyone say love
because everyone needs love.

742
00:39:12,490 --> 00:39:13,762
Love wins!

743
00:39:19,383 --> 00:39:20,363
Brigading!

744
00:39:21,064 --> 00:39:25,501
Standing in front of you is
amazing, entertaining,

745
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:29,495
outstanding, thirty-three-year-old
stunning.

746
00:39:29,771 --> 00:39:31,532
My name is Brigading.

747
00:39:31,774 --> 00:39:36,619
Ding, ding, ding!
Representing the Pearl of the Orient Seas,

748
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:37,611
Philippines!

749
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:41,901
And I,

750
00:39:42,562 --> 00:39:43,474
Thank you.

751
00:39:46,206 --> 00:39:47,968
Madame Yoko.

752
00:39:48,111 --> 00:39:52,090
Cheers everyone, Hello everyone.
Good evening everyone.

753
00:39:52,350 --> 00:39:56,633
This is Madame Yoko from
Drag Race Belgium, season two.

754
00:39:56,894 --> 00:40:02,499
And as we say, in the little,
small, tiny kingdom I live in, there is

755
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:05,666
only one perfect drag, and this is me.

756
00:40:07,606 --> 00:40:10,327
So talented, but very demented.

757
00:40:11,211 --> 00:40:12,965
So thank you for having me.

758
00:40:13,059 --> 00:40:13,559
Bye.

759
00:40:14,177 --> 00:40:15,180
Oh, I forgot.

760
00:40:15,678 --> 00:40:16,780
Peace for all.

761
00:40:18,043 --> 00:40:19,001
Kitty Space!

762
00:40:19,883 --> 00:40:21,064
Hello, Hello, Hello!

763
00:40:21,124 --> 00:40:23,983
I am Kitty Space from
Drag Race France Season Two.

764
00:40:24,173 --> 00:40:28,449
I came here to bring love, joy,
happiness, and a sausage

765
00:40:28,525 --> 00:40:29,365
and cheese.

766
00:40:29,664 --> 00:40:30,671
It's free!

767
00:40:30,972 --> 00:40:34,372
And don't forget, I am
the T of the LGBT.

768
00:40:35,236 --> 00:40:38,543
From Moulin Rouge to Manila, the
French girl came to say,

769
00:40:39,081 --> 00:40:40,503
Long live the gays!

770
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:40,948
Oh!

771
00:40:45,023 --> 00:40:45,921
Yuhua.

772
00:40:46,403 --> 00:40:47,765
Good evening, everyone.

773
00:40:48,015 --> 00:40:51,546
My name is Yuhua, and I should be Miss
Shutacca, because I know how

774
00:40:51,598 --> 00:40:53,548
to curse in five different languages.

775
00:40:53,889 --> 00:40:59,512
Cantonese, Mandarin, Espanol, English, and
since I also speak broken English,

776
00:40:59,585 --> 00:41:02,215
I also know how to curse in Engrish.

777
00:41:02,495 --> 00:41:06,232
Enjoy the night, everyone,
and I'll be representing the most

778
00:41:06,294 --> 00:41:09,160
beloved countries in
the world, USA and China.

779
00:41:13,146 --> 00:41:13,928
Khianna!

780
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:17,546
This horny queen standing
in front of you

781
00:41:17,957 --> 00:41:18,760
is a fresh.

782
00:41:19,403 --> 00:41:22,858
Fresh from Drag Race Philippines,
Season Three!

783
00:41:23,323 --> 00:41:27,794
My name is Khianna With a K, and
that K stands for K-arabao,

784
00:41:27,869 --> 00:41:30,180
with beastly strength like WOW.

785
00:41:31,113 --> 00:41:31,704
Bow.

786
00:41:38,126 --> 00:41:40,829
Oh, wow, wow, wow.

787
00:41:41,110 --> 00:41:44,956
The national costumes are
absolutely stunning.

788
00:41:45,017 --> 00:41:47,539
I'm sure we're going to love
the next category.

789
00:41:47,633 --> 00:41:48,785
Right, Mama Pao?

790
00:41:48,782 --> 00:41:49,764
Of course!

791
00:41:50,966 --> 00:41:52,639
Because the category is,

792
00:41:53,162 --> 00:41:54,401
Ruveal Yourself!

793
00:41:56,178 --> 00:41:58,050
First up, Suki Doll.

794
00:41:58,702 --> 00:42:03,082
Yes, love is in the air
and in your gown.

795
00:42:03,227 --> 00:42:07,428
Suki Doll means love, the
loved one. So I present you a heart.

796
00:42:07,673 --> 00:42:11,157
Ruveals of heart on heart.
And it is fashion, it is couture.

797
00:42:11,376 --> 00:42:15,142
Another reveal, of course. And
there you go, another heart on the couch.

798
00:42:16,144 --> 00:42:18,595
Ooh, she's got a heart on.
I think she likes us.

799
00:42:20,805 --> 00:42:21,584
Bernie,

800
00:42:22,262 --> 00:42:24,881
this is my debutant fantasy, sweet?

801
00:42:25,343 --> 00:42:26,977
And then, my second reveal,

802
00:42:27,367 --> 00:42:29,796
was my first step into doing drag.

803
00:42:30,077 --> 00:42:31,401
And my third reveal.

804
00:42:31,863 --> 00:42:34,680
This is the Bernie
that you know very well.

805
00:42:36,894 --> 00:42:39,180
What a beautiful gown! Wow!

806
00:42:39,289 --> 00:42:43,376
With a simple dream to
become a Slaysian Royale Queen.

807
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:46,981
Sum Ting Wong!

808
00:42:47,503 --> 00:42:48,932
You know, this really suits her.

809
00:42:49,084 --> 00:42:49,564
Oh, yeah.

810
00:42:50,354 --> 00:42:54,008
I'm giving a mishmash of
all sorts of things.

811
00:42:54,267 --> 00:42:55,247
You want a reveal?

812
00:42:55,468 --> 00:42:56,428
I'll give a reveal.

813
00:42:56,570 --> 00:42:59,010
My skirt will turn into another skirt.

814
00:42:59,131 --> 00:43:03,438
My top will come off, and then my
skirt will come off, and I'll be there in

815
00:43:03,495 --> 00:43:03,954
a thong.

816
00:43:04,115 --> 00:43:06,677
Man to woman, woman to man.

817
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,416
I think something's really wrong.

818
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:12,961
Arizona brandy.

819
00:43:13,861 --> 00:43:16,144
I love Miss Grand.

820
00:43:16,144 --> 00:43:20,667
So, Miss Grand, we, like, do,
like, fabulous reveals, so I want to

821
00:43:20,736 --> 00:43:25,327
achieve the most number of
reveals, and the judges are shocked with

822
00:43:25,396 --> 00:43:27,999
my merkin, because I'm here to reveal,

823
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:29,490
not just the outfit,

824
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:31,349
but who I am.

825
00:43:34,003 --> 00:43:35,981
Ooh. Ooh. All right.

826
00:43:36,715 --> 00:43:37,740
Okay. Yes.

827
00:43:38,443 --> 00:43:39,446
So much peeling!

828
00:43:39,506 --> 00:43:40,689
And many bangs!

829
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:46,599
Ivory glaze!

830
00:43:48,365 --> 00:43:51,019
You put the nasty in dynasty.

831
00:43:51,981 --> 00:43:56,141
I am this gorgeous woman
in Chinese brocade. It's red,

832
00:43:56,218 --> 00:43:58,452
it's gold, it's good fortune.

833
00:43:58,631 --> 00:44:03,117
And I take off that centerpiece
to reveal a gorgeous nude illusion.

834
00:44:03,155 --> 00:44:04,155
And you think I'm done.

835
00:44:04,218 --> 00:44:09,006
I get to the end of the runway and
I just reach up to my head and I rip

836
00:44:09,073 --> 00:44:11,704
apart my wig into this beautiful balls.

837
00:44:11,789 --> 00:44:13,071
I can see her va-china.

838
00:44:16,099 --> 00:44:17,162
Viñas Deluxe!

839
00:44:18,986 --> 00:44:24,128
People know me as funny, I'm sassy, I'm
loud, but they don't know that,

840
00:44:24,201 --> 00:44:29,487
at the end of the day, I have my own talk
and connection with my God, who

841
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:30,356
created me.

842
00:44:30,356 --> 00:44:36,262
This reveal is not just a reveal of a dress.
It's a revelation of my faith.

843
00:44:36,599 --> 00:44:37,769
I'm living

844
00:44:38,611 --> 00:44:39,448
on a prayer.

845
00:44:43,142 --> 00:44:44,287
Siam Phusri!

846
00:44:44,673 --> 00:44:46,276
Sawasdee-cunt!

847
00:44:47,090 --> 00:44:51,128
I am a Thahan Phran of the Golden
Phreah, Royal Guardian.

848
00:44:51,343 --> 00:44:55,646
First protector of the palace and spiritual
warrior in gold and black.

849
00:44:55,905 --> 00:45:01,163
And I turn up to this Thai
woman serving Thai food because Thai

850
00:45:01,246 --> 00:45:04,166
food is the best food in the world.

851
00:45:07,235 --> 00:45:08,995
Oh, I want to toss her salad.

852
00:45:09,267 --> 00:45:10,657
She's really serving.

853
00:45:11,858 --> 00:45:15,903
Brigadine, phoenix or not phoenix,
pass your papers.

854
00:45:17,256 --> 00:45:18,340
Smoldering.

855
00:45:18,490 --> 00:45:19,399
Blazing.

856
00:45:19,490 --> 00:45:20,399
Raging.

857
00:45:21,365 --> 00:45:23,865
This is the SariManok, the
Philippine Phoenix.

858
00:45:24,128 --> 00:45:27,920
Brigading in a blaze of feathers and
flame. From season one to now,

859
00:45:27,976 --> 00:45:29,392
from learning to winning.

860
00:45:29,432 --> 00:45:30,133
Brigading.

861
00:45:30,293 --> 00:45:31,836
Rebirth. Rubranded.

862
00:45:31,847 --> 00:45:33,044
Rumembered.

863
00:45:33,595 --> 00:45:35,057
Let me see your phoenix.

864
00:45:35,276 --> 00:45:37,298
Ooh, her vagina's on fire!

865
00:45:37,356 --> 00:45:37,983
Yeah.

866
00:45:37,999 --> 00:45:38,999
And reeking.

867
00:45:42,104 --> 00:45:43,066
Madame Yoko.

868
00:45:45,655 --> 00:45:46,731
Bone to be wild.

869
00:45:48,242 --> 00:45:49,956
So for my look for the reveal,

870
00:45:50,407 --> 00:45:56,620
it's the story about someone being vulnerable
and I relieve myself by

871
00:45:57,503 --> 00:46:02,191
Taking off this skin and I was
very proud as well because the reveal

872
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:07,293
is an outfit I made myself and this is
the way I wanted to present myself

873
00:46:07,362 --> 00:46:09,637
as the most natural way possible.

874
00:46:09,979 --> 00:46:11,793
She's so skin-ny.

875
00:46:13,043 --> 00:46:14,356
Kitty space!

876
00:46:15,905 --> 00:46:21,329
My evening gown reveal is a cocoon
becoming a butterfly.

877
00:46:21,354 --> 00:46:26,607
So I remove the big coat and then I shine
during the night because in French

878
00:46:26,676 --> 00:46:29,441
we call draqueen - "Butterfly of light".

879
00:46:29,475 --> 00:46:32,838
So the butterfly is coming out
and ready for the show.

880
00:46:33,733 --> 00:46:35,037
It's mint to be.

881
00:46:39,082 --> 00:46:40,151
Yuhua!

882
00:46:42,206 --> 00:46:44,628
For this look, it is the reveal.

883
00:46:44,787 --> 00:46:46,363
And guess who I am?

884
00:46:46,468 --> 00:46:48,129
Uncle Sam. Because why?

885
00:46:48,209 --> 00:46:51,258
Politicians are wolves in sheep's
clothing. And we've

886
00:46:51,315 --> 00:46:53,213
got the hat. We've got the skirt.

887
00:46:53,434 --> 00:46:54,695
We've got the top.

888
00:46:54,956 --> 00:46:57,376
And then I reveal myself to be a wolf.

889
00:46:57,477 --> 00:46:59,564
Was the fur a little bit shabby?

890
00:46:59,615 --> 00:47:00,139
Yes.

891
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:01,160
But you know what?

892
00:47:01,173 --> 00:47:02,200
I sold the look.

893
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:04,162
And I believe that's what counts.

894
00:47:04,343 --> 00:47:05,961
She looks terrific.

895
00:47:07,912 --> 00:47:09,336
That's her natural state.

896
00:47:10,050 --> 00:47:10,812
Khianna!

897
00:47:11,823 --> 00:47:16,123
So for this runway, I am representing
life and death. I'm in

898
00:47:16,195 --> 00:47:18,345
all white. Then I will reveal.

899
00:47:18,494 --> 00:47:19,896
And there's a body bag.

900
00:47:20,097 --> 00:47:20,878
Wow.

901
00:47:21,999 --> 00:47:23,122
And of course...

902
00:47:23,809 --> 00:47:24,733
Brainy!

903
00:47:25,376 --> 00:47:27,745
If you wonder if Khianna
really has a brain, yes she does.

904
00:47:31,472 --> 00:47:33,258
Internal organs realness

905
00:47:44,653 --> 00:47:47,878
And now let's start the Q&A round with

906
00:47:48,028 --> 00:47:50,057
Miss Suki Doll.

907
00:47:50,220 --> 00:47:52,544
Suki, pick your judge.

908
00:47:53,142 --> 00:47:54,485
Judge Jimbo.

909
00:47:55,457 --> 00:47:56,740
All right, Suki doll.

910
00:47:56,889 --> 00:48:01,760
Your question is what advice would you
give to someone that is afraid to

911
00:48:01,828 --> 00:48:02,436
come out?

912
00:48:03,079 --> 00:48:05,341
Your timer starts now.

913
00:48:05,622 --> 00:48:08,902
The advice that I would give to
somebody, who's afraid to

914
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:12,698
be themselves, is to take that first
step and be with the counsel

915
00:48:12,756 --> 00:48:17,013
of somebody, who's senior, who has
the experience, who has the livelihood,

916
00:48:17,070 --> 00:48:20,867
that went through it , so they
can embrace, in their shadow , what

917
00:48:20,925 --> 00:48:25,009
the steps, that have done before so that
they can have those same tools

918
00:48:25,067 --> 00:48:25,470
to use.

919
00:48:25,702 --> 00:48:26,814
Oh, it's penis-hed.

920
00:48:28,608 --> 00:48:29,267
Thank you.

921
00:48:29,271 --> 00:48:30,970
The wisdom of a good friend.

922
00:48:31,091 --> 00:48:33,267
A wisdom of a good friend always helps.

923
00:48:33,314 --> 00:48:34,615
Thank you very much.

924
00:48:35,539 --> 00:48:37,441
We have Bernie.

925
00:48:38,142 --> 00:48:39,265
Hi, Bernie.

926
00:48:39,385 --> 00:48:40,939
How are you feeling right now?

927
00:48:41,309 --> 00:48:43,412
I don't feel any pressure right now.

928
00:48:43,492 --> 00:48:43,934
Wow.

929
00:48:44,274 --> 00:48:45,597
But are you sure?

930
00:48:46,149 --> 00:48:46,738
Sure?

931
00:48:47,039 --> 00:48:48,222
I'm sure, bitch.

932
00:48:50,084 --> 00:48:51,899
Okay, Bernie, pick your judge.

933
00:48:52,347 --> 00:48:53,108
Maxie.

934
00:48:54,193 --> 00:48:59,428
Do you believe that love is love regardless
of gender or identity?

935
00:48:59,816 --> 00:49:01,405
Why or why not?

936
00:49:02,568 --> 00:49:06,742
Ahm... Do You not know, Maxie,
what that means?

937
00:49:07,562 --> 00:49:11,269
Oh my god, That's
insane. Do you really not know?

938
00:49:11,789 --> 00:49:14,204
Well, anyway, I don't know either.

939
00:49:14,519 --> 00:49:17,269
Because love is all around the world.

940
00:49:18,037 --> 00:49:21,841
Okay, thank you, Ms. KaladKaren and
Sir Jon. Thank you so much.

941
00:49:23,104 --> 00:49:25,695
Sum Ting Wong, this is your question.

942
00:49:26,689 --> 00:49:27,954
What would you say

943
00:49:28,216 --> 00:49:29,684
to a trans person

944
00:49:30,106 --> 00:49:32,318
who feels like they don't belong?

945
00:49:32,620 --> 00:49:34,341
Timer starts now.

946
00:49:34,510 --> 00:49:35,410
Fantastic question.

947
00:49:35,604 --> 00:49:37,566
I'm gonna do
press-ups for thirty seconds.

948
00:49:37,666 --> 00:49:42,104
Anyway, so anyway, if you want to
be trans and you have a problem trying

949
00:49:42,166 --> 00:49:46,111
to get people to be in with
you, what you should do is find your

950
00:49:46,172 --> 00:49:49,748
chosen family, because
that's more important than anything

951
00:49:49,810 --> 00:49:51,720
else you can have in the world.

952
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:52,952
She started doing push-ups.

953
00:49:54,050 --> 00:49:55,111
I don't know why.

954
00:49:55,965 --> 00:49:59,773
Your blood relatives don't matter as
much as the people who care and

955
00:49:59,829 --> 00:50:03,693
love you and choose to do so even though
they are not related to you.

956
00:50:04,033 --> 00:50:08,872
Don't worry, this is a really bad idea
to try and do for thirty seconds!

957
00:50:11,642 --> 00:50:18,407
Khianna, how can you teach kids
to be proud of their Asian heritage?

958
00:50:18,407 --> 00:50:18,809
Okay.

959
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:19,289
Okay.

960
00:50:19,751 --> 00:50:23,590
Since you won in the mini challenge,
you have additional

961
00:50:23,658 --> 00:50:26,195
five seconds to answer this question.

962
00:50:26,474 --> 00:50:28,557
Your timer starts now.

963
00:50:28,736 --> 00:50:29,718
Thank you very much.

964
00:50:29,758 --> 00:50:34,821
I believe that every kid should be proud
of whether they're Asian or not.

965
00:50:35,602 --> 00:50:40,878
It's about time to think before
we click. Just kidding. Hahahaa ...

966
00:50:40,956 --> 00:50:41,508
ahm ...

967
00:50:41,615 --> 00:50:46,583
Be proud of what you have. Because whether
you're Asian or not, what really

968
00:50:46,649 --> 00:50:51,086
matters is your love for others, and
having a heart for everyone in

969
00:50:51,152 --> 00:50:51,814
the world.

970
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:52,820
And I thank you.

971
00:50:54,365 --> 00:50:57,374
Next, we have Ivory Glaze.

972
00:50:58,282 --> 00:50:59,646
My question is,

973
00:50:59,936 --> 00:51:03,945
how can we stop discrimination
against Asians

974
00:51:04,350 --> 00:51:05,445
in everyday life?

975
00:51:05,762 --> 00:51:09,863
We can stop discrimination against Asians
in everyday life if we just think

976
00:51:09,918 --> 00:51:12,597
of them as like
penguins. Like everybody's like a

977
00:51:12,651 --> 00:51:14,291
penguin. They're all the same.

978
00:51:14,334 --> 00:51:17,646
Penguins are just like so cute and they're
like endangered. I'm sorry,

979
00:51:17,693 --> 00:51:19,349
I feel really impassioned about it.

980
00:51:19,456 --> 00:51:22,966
The penguins were like, penguins
are so sweet. No one cares if you're

981
00:51:23,017 --> 00:51:24,798
a gay penguin or not a gay penguin.

982
00:51:24,832 --> 00:51:26,233
Like, I think if we just think

983
00:51:29,724 --> 00:51:30,586
What penguins?

984
00:51:30,767 --> 00:51:31,575
No. Okay.

985
00:51:31,709 --> 00:51:34,314
Thank you very much, Ivory Glaze!

986
00:51:34,394 --> 00:51:35,457
Thank you, Ivory!

987
00:51:36,604 --> 00:51:42,753
My question for you is, what
would you say to a parent struggling

988
00:51:42,847 --> 00:51:45,401
to accept their LGBT child?

989
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:49,525
Ahm .... I want to explain to
a parent who has an LGBT

990
00:51:49,595 --> 00:51:52,061
child to accept their child because

991
00:51:52,383 --> 00:51:55,834
one day they will be proud of their
children, just like me.

992
00:51:55,874 --> 00:51:57,218
I used to hide my,

993
00:51:57,497 --> 00:52:02,332
ahm .... personality, I used to
hide my sexuality. And I used to hide

994
00:52:02,709 --> 00:52:07,660
my mouth, which is the thing that
is celebrated for right now.

995
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:08,602
Thank you very much.

996
00:52:08,899 --> 00:52:10,414
Hello Everyone!

997
00:52:11,073 --> 00:52:17,901
Why do you think some people
struggle to understand the trans community?

998
00:52:18,702 --> 00:52:22,209
For me, people sometimes they don't understand
trans people because they

999
00:52:22,258 --> 00:52:24,548
don't know how human beings
are supposed to be.

1000
00:52:25,169 --> 00:52:26,414
We're here to live

1001
00:52:26,881 --> 00:52:28,311
and enjoy our life.

1002
00:52:28,611 --> 00:52:31,394
I don't think we need to care anymore
about what people think.

1003
00:52:31,474 --> 00:52:33,475
We need to care about what we are.

1004
00:52:33,916 --> 00:52:38,882
We need to know that we deserve to be
happy, because we are responsible

1005
00:52:38,952 --> 00:52:39,861
for our life.

1006
00:52:40,582 --> 00:52:41,410
When we die,

1007
00:52:41,796 --> 00:52:43,546
no one will know how happy we are.

1008
00:52:43,608 --> 00:52:44,517
Only you.

1009
00:52:44,713 --> 00:52:49,055
You deserve to do everything
that you love because it's your time.

1010
00:52:50,378 --> 00:52:51,240
Thank you.

1011
00:52:51,260 --> 00:52:52,220
It was time.

1012
00:52:53,503 --> 00:52:58,525
My question for you is, if
you had access to a time machine,

1013
00:52:58,608 --> 00:53:00,869
where would you go and why?

1014
00:53:01,198 --> 00:53:03,457
I think I will go to the future

1015
00:53:03,892 --> 00:53:04,588
to see

1016
00:53:04,986 --> 00:53:06,979
the beauty of acceptance

1017
00:53:07,361 --> 00:53:10,209
for the LGBTQIA plus community.

1018
00:53:10,416 --> 00:53:13,238
I think we all deserve to be accepted,

1019
00:53:13,477 --> 00:53:14,573
celebrated,

1020
00:53:14,831 --> 00:53:17,941
and if the time comes that we're there,

1021
00:53:18,343 --> 00:53:22,801
It's going to be one big happy family. It's
going to be a beautiful world that

1022
00:53:22,858 --> 00:53:24,972
we will all live in. And I thank you.

1023
00:53:25,108 --> 00:53:25,709
Yes.

1024
00:53:28,231 --> 00:53:29,492
What would you say

1025
00:53:30,093 --> 00:53:30,883
to someone

1026
00:53:31,936 --> 00:53:35,539
who thinks all Asians are the same?

1027
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:37,296
Timer starts now.

1028
00:53:38,562 --> 00:53:41,033
Well, you have to say that
you are lucky. I didn't bring my

1029
00:53:41,075 --> 00:53:43,840
brain today, but atleast I have black
hair, so everything is fine.

1030
00:53:44,314 --> 00:53:48,925
I would simply tell her that you
have to look closely. You have to learn

1031
00:53:48,989 --> 00:53:53,727
to understand. The unknown can be
scary. Because in life, you should never

1032
00:53:53,791 --> 00:53:56,865
regret anything. We
have to keep moving forward.

1033
00:53:57,874 --> 00:53:58,629
Thank you very much.

1034
00:53:58,874 --> 00:54:00,003
Wow, well said.

1035
00:54:00,006 --> 00:54:01,169
Thank you.

1036
00:54:01,845 --> 00:54:03,834
What is your opinion

1037
00:54:04,698 --> 00:54:06,260
on cancel culture?

1038
00:54:06,803 --> 00:54:08,028
And social media.

1039
00:54:13,811 --> 00:54:15,015
France!

1040
00:54:18,048 --> 00:54:18,823
Thank you.

1041
00:54:19,253 --> 00:54:20,928
It was not correct.

1042
00:54:22,102 --> 00:54:26,853
Which of your fellow contestants
do you think should go home tonight

1043
00:54:26,923 --> 00:54:27,481
and why?

1044
00:54:27,682 --> 00:54:28,282
Ooh.

1045
00:54:29,832 --> 00:54:32,160
Your timer starts now.

1046
00:54:32,722 --> 00:54:34,262
Girl, I don't know.

1047
00:54:34,340 --> 00:54:36,061
I'm just a werewolf, baby.

1048
00:54:36,441 --> 00:54:39,057
But all I know is if you're
adults watching,

1049
00:54:39,436 --> 00:54:40,044
do not

1050
00:54:40,363 --> 00:54:41,044
do drugs.

1051
00:54:42,425 --> 00:54:44,872
Unless somebody else is paying for it.

1052
00:54:48,856 --> 00:54:49,946
One plus one.

1053
00:54:50,475 --> 00:54:51,584
Two. Thank you.

1054
00:54:51,671 --> 00:54:52,445
I'm just kidding.

1055
00:54:53,178 --> 00:54:54,521
So here's your question.

1056
00:54:55,664 --> 00:54:59,004
Arizona, how would you use your platform

1057
00:54:59,356 --> 00:55:01,365
to promote inclusivity

1058
00:55:01,943 --> 00:55:06,731
and understanding for
the LGBTQIA plus community?

1059
00:55:07,850 --> 00:55:12,938
I would use my platform to promote inclusivity
to the LGBTQIA community

1060
00:55:13,010 --> 00:55:16,450
by facing any
challenges with my head held high.

1061
00:55:16,731 --> 00:55:19,903
Moments ago, I was given the disadvantage
of having twenty-five

1062
00:55:19,953 --> 00:55:21,615
seconds to answer, but I am here.

1063
00:55:21,794 --> 00:55:26,760
I am the example of just standing up and
facing all the challenges, and I

1064
00:55:27,247 --> 00:55:27,988
thank you.

1065
00:55:31,024 --> 00:55:34,914
And that's it for our question
and answer portion.

1066
00:55:35,195 --> 00:55:36,961
The results are in!

1067
00:55:37,483 --> 00:55:40,999
We will be sharing the result a
little later, but for now...

1068
00:55:41,602 --> 00:55:43,765
This has been your host, John Santos.

1069
00:55:44,182 --> 00:55:48,285
I am Mrs. Jervie
Wrightson, also known as KaladKaren.

1070
00:55:48,461 --> 00:55:50,111
Shutacca, John.

1071
00:55:50,298 --> 00:55:53,153
And Shutacca to the whole, damn crowd.

1072
00:55:53,332 --> 00:55:54,590
This has been -

1073
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:54,611
This has been

1074
00:55:54,713 --> 00:55:59,474
Miss Shutacca Slaysian Edition.

1075
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:01,519
Good night

1076
00:55:59,657 --> 00:56:01,537
Good Night

1077
00:56:06,327 --> 00:56:07,604
Welcome back, Queens.

1078
00:56:07,930 --> 00:56:09,448
Before we move forward,

1079
00:56:09,724 --> 00:56:11,966
I have some major, major news.

1080
00:56:12,055 --> 00:56:13,276
We're shaking things up.

1081
00:56:13,796 --> 00:56:16,077
The regular Lip Sync for
Your Life format

1082
00:56:16,495 --> 00:56:18,128
is on hold.

1083
00:56:18,903 --> 00:56:20,200
From this moment on,

1084
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:23,044
we're adopting the lipstick format,

1085
00:56:23,629 --> 00:56:25,450
where the top two queens will face off

1086
00:56:25,952 --> 00:56:27,800
in a lip sync for their legacy.

1087
00:56:28,602 --> 00:56:29,704
So this means

1088
00:56:30,195 --> 00:56:32,171
the winner will hold the power

1089
00:56:32,532 --> 00:56:36,111
to eliminate one of the
bottom two queens.

1090
00:56:36,966 --> 00:56:38,082
Its going to be a difficult task.

1091
00:56:38,282 --> 00:56:42,412
It's like you are cutting off..
You're like chopping these girls dreams.

1092
00:56:43,082 --> 00:56:43,885
It's hard.

1093
00:56:44,122 --> 00:56:48,485
What is this? Why did you make us
the judge here? What is this?

1094
00:56:49,742 --> 00:56:50,740
Now, Queens,

1095
00:56:51,581 --> 00:56:53,660
after witnessing your

1096
00:56:53,903 --> 00:56:59,231
Miss Shutacca Slaysian
Edition performances and runways,

1097
00:56:59,418 --> 00:57:01,595
I have made some decisions.

1098
00:57:01,995 --> 00:57:03,245
When I call your name,

1099
00:57:03,985 --> 00:57:05,956
please step forward.

1100
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:08,441
Yuhua ....

1101
00:57:09,825 --> 00:57:11,635
Vinas Deluxe,

1102
00:57:11,832 --> 00:57:12,537
Bernie,

1103
00:57:13,410 --> 00:57:14,787
Ivory Glaze.

1104
00:57:15,816 --> 00:57:16,807
Suki Doll.

1105
00:57:17,952 --> 00:57:19,999
Queens, you are all safe.

1106
00:57:20,586 --> 00:57:25,881
Safe is okay, but safe is not
where we want to be for all the season.

1107
00:57:26,343 --> 00:57:28,908
You may now go to
the werkroom and untuck.

1108
00:57:29,892 --> 00:57:31,548
We did it, we're not in the bottom two.

1109
00:57:31,586 --> 00:57:32,608
Love it!

1110
00:57:34,162 --> 00:57:39,035
For the remaining queens, you
represent the tops and the bottoms of the week.

1111
00:57:39,394 --> 00:57:41,099
Now let's start with the critiques,

1112
00:57:41,620 --> 00:57:43,802
starting with Sum Ting Wong.

1113
00:57:44,043 --> 00:57:49,440
Your first runway, I really felt
the UK vibes. It was giving Sherlock

1114
00:57:49,518 --> 00:57:52,021
homo, but I didn't really get...

1115
00:57:52,483 --> 00:57:55,608
a connection to your Asian
heritage in it?

1116
00:57:55,887 --> 00:57:59,411
My cultural heritage was being
brought up in England and it was meant to

1117
00:57:59,460 --> 00:58:02,397
mimic something to do with
the English wars and where people

1118
00:58:02,446 --> 00:58:04,550
were relocated from their
homes for safety.

1119
00:58:05,102 --> 00:58:07,546
And my parents came to the
UK because of the Vietnam War.

1120
00:58:07,945 --> 00:58:11,603
It's a shame it didn't come
across that way, but I wanted to show

1121
00:58:11,660 --> 00:58:15,262
an authentic part of myself,
but I guess I didn't do it as well.

1122
00:58:15,543 --> 00:58:19,990
No, now that I understand the
luggage, I can see the significance of that.

1123
00:58:20,392 --> 00:58:23,256
And I saw you reference it
when you tapped on it.

1124
00:58:23,378 --> 00:58:25,974
Now that I know that, I think
that was a really powerful message.

1125
00:58:26,023 --> 00:58:30,209
For me, I really enjoy your character
on stage. It's very jolly.

1126
00:58:30,410 --> 00:58:32,394
It's just that execution.

1127
00:58:32,492 --> 00:58:34,550
It's so messy for me, you know?

1128
00:58:34,577 --> 00:58:35,401
I wanted to

1129
00:58:35,919 --> 00:58:37,649
be the fumbly little clown.

1130
00:58:38,262 --> 00:58:41,133
but I feel like it maybe came
across as too fumbly.

1131
00:58:41,707 --> 00:58:45,336
It's okay to be fun, to be
quirky, but there's also a refinement.

1132
00:58:45,715 --> 00:58:50,062
With your question and answer,
well, I really enjoyed it, to be honest.

1133
00:58:50,890 --> 00:58:55,263
I really love the gimmick. I love
that you showed the people that you are

1134
00:58:52,715 --> 00:58:53,642
The Gimmick!

1135
00:58:55,323 --> 00:58:57,899
very, very strong.
And I love that for you.

1136
00:58:57,977 --> 00:58:59,399
But not for me though.

1137
00:58:59,456 --> 00:59:01,082
Thank you, Sum Ting Wong!

1138
00:59:01,202 --> 00:59:06,037
Now, Khianna, how does it
feel that the one who beat you in

1139
00:59:06,119 --> 00:59:08,658
your season is now judging you?

1140
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:10,021
I feel honored.

1141
00:59:10,657 --> 00:59:14,046
Actually, first honored because
she is the champion.

1142
00:59:14,686 --> 00:59:16,669
The second honor!
She is the first honor.

1143
00:59:16,769 --> 00:59:21,316
But I have to commend you by using
the national animal of the Philippines,

1144
00:59:21,377 --> 00:59:22,115
the carabao.

1145
00:59:22,296 --> 00:59:25,673
It was a unique blend of masculinity
and femininity.

1146
00:59:25,879 --> 00:59:28,256
The decision was incredibly wise.

1147
00:59:28,503 --> 00:59:31,285
And your reveal yourself look was
really, really cool as well.

1148
00:59:31,345 --> 00:59:35,858
There's a beautiful cross-section of
glamour and fun and playfulness.

1149
00:59:35,924 --> 00:59:39,129
And as a spooky, kooky queen,
I appreciated that.

1150
00:59:39,309 --> 00:59:41,532
Thank you, Khianna. Next, Siam Phusri.

1151
00:59:41,872 --> 00:59:43,492
You are so beautiful.

1152
00:59:43,954 --> 00:59:45,934
You're bursting with charisma.

1153
00:59:46,414 --> 00:59:47,358
Thank you.

1154
00:59:47,615 --> 00:59:50,155
The moment you step on the stage.

1155
00:59:50,238 --> 00:59:50,758
Wow.

1156
00:59:51,137 --> 00:59:52,276
Our jaws dropped.

1157
00:59:52,479 --> 00:59:52,919
Really.

1158
00:59:52,979 --> 00:59:53,499
Thank you.

1159
00:59:53,700 --> 00:59:56,841
For your first runway, why did
you wear a big RuBadge?

1160
00:59:57,202 --> 01:00:01,626
In my season, I never had the opportunity
to win any RuBadge.

1161
01:00:01,671 --> 01:00:02,146
Oh.

1162
01:00:02,146 --> 01:00:03,418
But I'm happy that

1163
01:00:03,774 --> 01:00:06,110
I was able to represent something.

1164
01:00:06,510 --> 01:00:13,908
And today I'm so happy that I can
be LGBTQ rainbow and proud to be Thai.

1165
01:00:14,115 --> 01:00:16,358
Your first runway was really powerful.

1166
01:00:16,678 --> 01:00:20,874
You know, it was about legalization of
same-sex marriage in your country.

1167
01:00:21,622 --> 01:00:24,619
first Southeast Asian nation to do so.

1168
01:00:25,070 --> 01:00:27,233
And for this Ruveal,

1169
01:00:27,780 --> 01:00:29,260
it was done flawlessly.

1170
01:00:30,070 --> 01:00:32,930
You had one of the
best answers in the Q&A.

1171
01:00:32,983 --> 01:00:34,872
Oh, thank you, thank you.

1172
01:00:34,892 --> 01:00:36,948
I felt like I was watching
Miss Universe.

1173
01:00:36,979 --> 01:00:39,599
Shutacca!

1174
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:40,702
Thank you, thank you.

1175
01:00:40,923 --> 01:00:41,633
Brigiding.

1176
01:00:42,003 --> 01:00:45,869
With your first look, I want to say
it was absolutely breathtaking.

1177
01:00:46,068 --> 01:00:50,088
It looked just so
special, so editorial, so fashion.

1178
01:00:50,334 --> 01:00:52,785
Your second runway was smoking hot.

1179
01:00:53,577 --> 01:00:56,450
Your smoke effect
really made you stand out.

1180
01:00:56,903 --> 01:01:00,668
I hosnestly felt a different
level of sadness, because I didn't hear

1181
01:01:00,723 --> 01:01:02,827
from any good critiques in Season One.

1182
01:01:02,988 --> 01:01:07,267
To be getting these comments
from the judges, it felt so amazing.

1183
01:01:07,566 --> 01:01:09,026
Madame Yoko,

1184
01:01:09,861 --> 01:01:14,302
for your first look, I would say it's
kind of safe compared to your

1185
01:01:14,369 --> 01:01:15,296
fellow queens.

1186
01:01:15,379 --> 01:01:17,593
It needed more editing.

1187
01:01:18,523 --> 01:01:20,229
With your pageant look,

1188
01:01:20,662 --> 01:01:23,640
the Ruveal was kind of underwhelming.

1189
01:01:24,684 --> 01:01:28,061
I just don't think
that the hair is giving.

1190
01:01:28,331 --> 01:01:30,061
You look unfinished.

1191
01:01:30,233 --> 01:01:31,414
Thank you, Madame Yoko.

1192
01:01:31,436 --> 01:01:34,242
Now, Kitty Space.. From France.

1193
01:01:32,381 --> 01:01:32,965
hi

1194
01:01:34,523 --> 01:01:37,361
Your first runway
was really, really fun.

1195
01:01:37,642 --> 01:01:39,966
I love a burlesque moment.

1196
01:01:40,166 --> 01:01:44,088
This look that you have on
now is really spectacular. I love

1197
01:01:44,154 --> 01:01:46,245
the headpiece. I love the color.

1198
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:46,832
Thank you.

1199
01:01:46,832 --> 01:01:51,095
I think the only thing I would change is maybe
a little bit more volume and maybe

1200
01:01:51,147 --> 01:01:53,358
show your legs and maybe
a different shoe.

1201
01:01:53,657 --> 01:01:54,626
Thank you, Jimbo.

1202
01:01:54,658 --> 01:01:55,532
Thank you, Kitty.

1203
01:01:55,591 --> 01:01:56,254
Thank you.

1204
01:01:56,340 --> 01:01:58,041
Arizona Brandy.

1205
01:01:59,122 --> 01:02:03,200
Your first look, I think, is
the most beautiful that I've seen

1206
01:02:03,266 --> 01:02:03,727
you in.

1207
01:02:03,787 --> 01:02:04,856
Aw, thank you.

1208
01:02:04,887 --> 01:02:07,495
You elevated the national costume.

1209
01:02:08,231 --> 01:02:13,986
Your second runway, I had the most
laugh with your ruveals.

1210
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:18,756
You know your timing very well, and
that's what I love about you.

1211
01:02:19,562 --> 01:02:20,923
With your Q&A,

1212
01:02:21,354 --> 01:02:23,006
you had a disadvantage

1213
01:02:23,289 --> 01:02:25,901
and you turned it into your advantage.

1214
01:02:27,224 --> 01:02:33,294
Well, thank you all of you for showing us
what Asian excellence is all about.

1215
01:02:34,235 --> 01:02:37,561
Now, we have made some decisions.

1216
01:02:38,776 --> 01:02:39,744
Khianna.

1217
01:02:40,591 --> 01:02:42,405
Siam Phusri.

1218
01:02:42,890 --> 01:02:48,037
Condragulations. You are the top
two slaysians of the week.

1219
01:02:51,845 --> 01:02:53,113
Oh my gosh!

1220
01:02:53,564 --> 01:02:55,280
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh.

1221
01:02:55,633 --> 01:02:58,803
Like, yes! So now I'm like top two.

1222
01:02:58,854 --> 01:03:01,899
Oh my God. It's unbelievable.

1223
01:03:02,169 --> 01:03:03,015
Brigiding.

1224
01:03:03,762 --> 01:03:04,655
Arizona,

1225
01:03:05,735 --> 01:03:06,809
Kitty Space.

1226
01:03:07,354 --> 01:03:08,899
You three are safe.

1227
01:03:10,104 --> 01:03:13,684
which means Sum Ting Wong,
and Madame Yoko,

1228
01:03:14,930 --> 01:03:17,021
you are the bottom two this week.

1229
01:03:18,142 --> 01:03:19,725
Khianna and Siam Phusri.

1230
01:03:20,767 --> 01:03:24,191
Each of you will have to
decide which of the bottom two queens

1231
01:03:24,657 --> 01:03:29,686
you choose to eliminate if you win
the Lipsync for your legacy.

1232
01:03:30,543 --> 01:03:33,907
So while you queens deliberate
in the werkroom,

1233
01:03:34,769 --> 01:03:36,470
the judges and I...

1234
01:03:37,414 --> 01:03:38,767
We'll go home.

1235
01:03:38,948 --> 01:03:39,561
No.

1236
01:03:41,533 --> 01:03:43,461
We'll be giving out homecoming treats.

1237
01:03:44,928 --> 01:03:49,899
So you can go to the werkroom and
deliberate, please evaporate.

1238
01:03:54,428 --> 01:03:55,497
See you, Queens!

1239
01:03:57,914 --> 01:03:59,039
Sisters!

1240
01:03:59,097 --> 01:04:00,600
Here they are!

1241
01:04:01,762 --> 01:04:05,870
I'm like, I enjoy the energy that we can
hold the power in the room. I feel

1242
01:04:05,925 --> 01:04:08,664
like being top two ,
this is how it feels , girls!

1243
01:04:09,323 --> 01:04:10,503
Oh my god, there's kwek-kwek!

1244
01:04:10,586 --> 01:04:12,785
Yeah sister, come come come.

1245
01:04:12,910 --> 01:04:15,189
Girls, who's on the top and
who's on the bottom?

1246
01:04:15,222 --> 01:04:16,077
We need some answer.

1247
01:04:16,084 --> 01:04:18,894
Khianna and Siam are on the top.

1248
01:04:19,015 --> 01:04:20,128
I'm here, darling!

1249
01:04:20,128 --> 01:04:21,102
And me and,

1250
01:04:21,177 --> 01:04:23,278
I know Arizona's in the
top, is she here?

1251
01:04:23,399 --> 01:04:24,620
I'm not on the top. What?

1252
01:04:24,680 --> 01:04:26,247
If you win money, I'm taking ....

1253
01:04:26,282 --> 01:04:27,778
What ? Bitch ! don't fucking lie.

1254
01:04:28,296 --> 01:04:30,385
I wish that I made it to the top two.

1255
01:04:31,026 --> 01:04:36,995
However, I somehow agree because I think
we all did good in the challenge.

1256
01:04:37,155 --> 01:04:39,986
And I'm happy that I
don't get to decide the first

1257
01:04:40,043 --> 01:04:42,082
person who's going to be eliminated.

1258
01:04:42,423 --> 01:04:43,836
For me, they didn't understand

1259
01:04:44,283 --> 01:04:46,407
the fact that I wasn't

1260
01:04:46,843 --> 01:04:52,022
really in the representation of
Asia with my outfit, national outfit,

1261
01:04:52,097 --> 01:04:56,075
but I was in the Belgian representation
of my country

1262
01:04:56,150 --> 01:04:57,050
of adoption.

1263
01:04:57,785 --> 01:04:58,684
And,

1264
01:05:01,403 --> 01:05:03,579
And well Sum Ting Wong crying.

1265
01:05:04,403 --> 01:05:08,764
I can understand because
critiques that we get, you don't always

1266
01:05:08,833 --> 01:05:10,740
understand why the judges...

1267
01:05:11,207 --> 01:05:16,117
think or say what they say
because for you, you have done your best.

1268
01:05:16,182 --> 01:05:17,407
But how do you feel, Sum Ting?

1269
01:05:17,867 --> 01:05:18,553
You okay?

1270
01:05:18,836 --> 01:05:19,283
Yeah.

1271
01:05:21,387 --> 01:05:24,410
The things that they said on stage were
exactly the things that I had

1272
01:05:24,454 --> 01:05:24,979
issues with.

1273
01:05:26,466 --> 01:05:27,753
I didn't get my point across.

1274
01:05:29,702 --> 01:05:31,227
I've always been that Asian.

1275
01:05:31,778 --> 01:05:34,470
TMy Heritage - he only heritage
I know is British.

1276
01:05:35,722 --> 01:05:39,562
and having the opportunity to
learn my Asian self and the beauty of

1277
01:05:39,619 --> 01:05:40,707
it with all of you.

1278
01:05:41,742 --> 01:05:45,461
And the idea that it
could be taken away, so quick.

1279
01:05:48,213 --> 01:05:50,256
It really, really, really hurts.

1280
01:05:52,164 --> 01:05:56,956
I recognize myself in what
you say, because they also didn't

1281
01:05:57,036 --> 01:05:59,832
find my Asian culture in my runway.

1282
01:06:01,271 --> 01:06:02,508
I'm back now.

1283
01:06:03,050 --> 01:06:04,918
Let me have a moment, please.

1284
01:06:06,303 --> 01:06:08,528
Oh, that's something.

1285
01:06:08,729 --> 01:06:09,671
That's something.

1286
01:06:10,113 --> 01:06:11,294
That's Sum Ting Wong.

1287
01:06:13,099 --> 01:06:13,640
If you want.

1288
01:06:14,133 --> 01:06:19,299
someone who's just had the biggest fire
under them to really see you in

1289
01:06:19,372 --> 01:06:20,099
the final.

1290
01:06:20,903 --> 01:06:22,113
Then please save me.

1291
01:06:23,655 --> 01:06:27,943
I believe he is really pretty big in UK.
You know, she says she do drag for

1292
01:06:28,269 --> 01:06:33,529
From many years so I feel like he, she might
have a lot of opportunity to grow,

1293
01:06:33,596 --> 01:06:38,921
you know. But Madame Yoko is like, I
get to know her already from the first day.

1294
01:06:39,303 --> 01:06:41,240
I give love to her already.

1295
01:06:41,225 --> 01:06:45,120
This is very difficult because you're
gonna crush somebody's dreams

1296
01:06:45,178 --> 01:06:47,155
and nobody wants to go home first.

1297
01:06:49,338 --> 01:06:51,282
We don't know any track records yet.

1298
01:06:51,782 --> 01:06:55,995
I don't know some of these girls so
it's very pressuring to choose.

1299
01:06:56,224 --> 01:06:59,122
I think I'm just gonna go with
like whoever is like

1300
01:06:59,599 --> 01:07:04,412
willing to go through and has like
the eagerness to like stay,

1301
01:07:04,490 --> 01:07:07,207
I think I'm gonna choose that girl.

1302
01:07:10,311 --> 01:07:14,586
I think something Wong do a
really good job, you know, like how

1303
01:07:14,654 --> 01:07:17,097
she puts herself during like runway.

1304
01:07:17,097 --> 01:07:21,438
Madame Yoko, I feel like we really have
good connection and I feel like

1305
01:07:21,499 --> 01:07:25,655
if I am the position that he is, he
will probably choose to save me.

1306
01:07:26,082 --> 01:07:27,347
That's why it's hard for me to choose.

1307
01:07:30,457 --> 01:07:31,441
Welcome back.

1308
01:07:32,082 --> 01:07:34,905
Two top slaysians stand before me.

1309
01:07:35,582 --> 01:07:40,321
Prior to tonight, you were asked to
prepare a lip-sync performance

1310
01:07:40,393 --> 01:07:43,481
of debut by the
global girl group, KATSEYE.

1311
01:07:44,619 --> 01:07:48,939
Ladies, this is your chance to impress
me, win eighty thousand

1312
01:07:49,008 --> 01:07:54,235
pesos, and earn the power to give one of
the bottom queens the karate chop.

1313
01:07:58,820 --> 01:08:00,001
The time has come.

1314
01:08:00,702 --> 01:08:03,785
For you to lip-sync, for your legacy!

1315
01:08:05,867 --> 01:08:09,649
For all beauty pageants and all
of Thai versus Philippines

1316
01:08:09,715 --> 01:08:13,236
competitions... , How is
it Thai vs Philippines again?

1317
01:08:13,695 --> 01:08:15,581
Let's see who gonna win!

1318
01:08:16,496 --> 01:08:21,843
Hi Siam, Sawasdee kha, , but I
am more sawadee kunt, so...

1319
01:08:22,304 --> 01:08:23,388
Let's see about that.

1320
01:08:23,689 --> 01:08:24,790
Sawasdee Kunt with a K

1321
01:08:25,478 --> 01:08:26,059
Good luck.

1322
01:08:26,643 --> 01:08:28,728
And don't fuck it up!

1323
01:09:27,964 --> 01:09:32,416
Siam was so fierce. She busted
out some bollywood moves to "debut".

1324
01:10:22,063 --> 01:10:25,473
But Khianna was really moving
like this, so I was like, uh, uh, uh.

1325
01:10:47,184 --> 01:10:50,198
Ladies, I have made my decision.

1326
01:10:53,434 --> 01:10:54,178
Khianna.

1327
01:10:55,282 --> 01:10:57,005
Condragulations!

1328
01:10:57,345 --> 01:10:58,647
You're a winner, baby!

1329
01:10:59,568 --> 01:11:02,805
You won a cash tip of eighty
thousand pesos.

1330
01:11:03,147 --> 01:11:07,198
And you will also receive a RuBadge.
Give her the RuBadge!

1331
01:11:08,004 --> 01:11:08,678
Thank you!

1332
01:11:09,063 --> 01:11:11,191
Wear it with Slaysian pride, Khianna.

1333
01:11:11,472 --> 01:11:14,000
Oh my gosh, oh my
gosh. Deja vu. Kidding.

1334
01:11:14,964 --> 01:11:19,975
It happened to me twice in the
Mini and Maxi challenge.

1335
01:11:20,457 --> 01:11:22,322
So yeah, I'm so happy, shit.

1336
01:11:23,103 --> 01:11:24,428
Siam Phusri.

1337
01:11:25,149 --> 01:11:27,375
You are safe to slay another day.

1338
01:11:27,677 --> 01:11:29,350
You may join the other girls.

1339
01:11:29,884 --> 01:11:32,019
So now, the bottom queens.

1340
01:11:32,075 --> 01:11:32,848
Khianna.

1341
01:11:33,702 --> 01:11:38,224
With great power from our Slaysian
ancestors, comes

1342
01:11:38,313 --> 01:11:40,174
great responsibility.

1343
01:11:40,595 --> 01:11:43,902
Which queen have you
chosen to get the karate chop?

1344
01:11:45,044 --> 01:11:50,880
I chose this queen just because I didn't
enjoy her performance and the

1345
01:11:50,963 --> 01:11:54,214
vibe that she's giving on the werkroom.

1346
01:11:54,295 --> 01:11:57,017
And you are and will always be an icon,

1347
01:11:57,684 --> 01:12:00,022
a legend, a superstar. But I'm sorry.

1348
01:12:00,415 --> 01:12:01,326
I chose...

1349
01:12:03,398 --> 01:12:04,620
Yoko to go home.

1350
01:12:09,630 --> 01:12:10,988
Good girl, good girl.

1351
01:12:14,603 --> 01:12:15,817
I said, okay girl,

1352
01:12:17,402 --> 01:12:20,358
if you have to leave now, then...

1353
01:12:21,823 --> 01:12:25,714
Do it with the head looking forward.

1354
01:12:26,387 --> 01:12:30,169
As it is written, so it shall be done.

1355
01:12:31,110 --> 01:12:36,197
Madame Yoko, the enigmatic
and chic drag queen from Belgium.

1356
01:12:36,338 --> 01:12:39,062
You will always be a Slaysian sensation.

1357
01:12:39,582 --> 01:12:44,954
I have been so, so happy to
be able to meet all of you here.

1358
01:12:45,378 --> 01:12:48,361
I will keep that in my mind forever.

1359
01:12:49,442 --> 01:12:51,219
Thank you, Madame Yoko. Now,

1360
01:12:52,469 --> 01:12:53,613
Sashay away.

1361
01:13:01,006 --> 01:13:03,354
I'll slay in another part
of the world then.

1362
01:13:03,595 --> 01:13:04,698
Thank you, bye!

1363
01:13:08,352 --> 01:13:10,880
The thing I've
learned the most is how...

1364
01:13:11,643 --> 01:13:18,339
to present yourself. Because the
queens here in the Philippines know how to

1365
01:13:18,429 --> 01:13:18,964
do so.

1366
01:13:19,541 --> 01:13:24,792
I know that I will keep it as a souvenir
and I will bring it back in

1367
01:13:24,869 --> 01:13:30,352
my luggage. Also back to Europe in Belgium
and Luxembourg where I live.

1368
01:13:32,103 --> 01:13:33,805
Condragulations, Queens.

1369
01:13:34,168 --> 01:13:37,213
You have made all your mothers proud.

1370
01:13:37,513 --> 01:13:38,635
Your mothers are all queens!

1371
01:13:39,558 --> 01:13:40,733
Your mother is a queen, too!

1372
01:13:39,589 --> 01:13:40,688
Your mother is a queen, too!

1373
01:13:39,622 --> 01:13:41,015
Your mother is a queen, too!

1374
01:13:42,390 --> 01:13:46,233
And remember, always be true
to yourself in your thoughts, in

1375
01:13:46,296 --> 01:13:48,942
your words, and in everything
that you do.

1376
01:13:49,171 --> 01:13:51,277
All heart. Alwayys and in all ways.

1377
01:13:51,742 --> 01:13:53,625
Can I get an amen up in here?

1378
01:13:54,505 --> 01:13:57,677
Amen! Now let the
music play! Party, party!

1379
01:13:57,737 --> 01:13:59,131
Let's reincarnate!

1380
01:14:18,384 --> 01:14:20,888
Next on Drag Race Philippines:
Slaysian Royale.

1381
01:14:20,888 --> 01:14:24,995
Now for your maxi-challenge,
queens. Get ready your A-pop fantasies.

1382
01:14:25,054 --> 01:14:28,835
Because you'll be forming your
very own girl groups!

1383
01:14:30,144 --> 01:14:32,700
You guys were absolutely amazing.

1384
01:14:32,777 --> 01:14:36,881
You started so strong, but a
little messy in the end.

1385
01:14:37,076 --> 01:14:40,394
You are the reason we change the
choreos every time, because you kept fucking

1386
01:14:40,437 --> 01:14:40,696
it up.

1387
01:14:40,942 --> 01:14:42,021
I kept fucking it up?

1388
01:14:42,419 --> 01:14:43,303
It's a war!

1389
01:14:44,330 --> 01:14:46,048
We're really in the competition now.
