00:00:01,307 --> 00:00:04,143
Previously on Drag Race Philippines: Slaysian Royale.

2
00:00:04,143 --> 00:00:06,112
Queens, for this week's Maxi Challenge,

3
00:00:06,112 --> 00:00:08,614
You'll be creating jaw-dropping couture looks

4
00:00:08,614 --> 00:00:10,950
using fossilized cacao leaves.

5
00:00:11,117 --> 00:00:13,052
I want to show everyone

6
00:00:13,052 --> 00:00:16,722
and myself, as well, that I can be a look queen.

7
00:00:16,722 --> 00:00:17,623
Arizona!

8
00:00:17,623 --> 00:00:19,325
I like the orange on you.

9
00:00:19,358 --> 00:00:21,927
but I have to say that this look is

10
00:00:21,927 --> 00:00:23,462
underwhelming.

11
00:00:23,663 --> 00:00:25,398
Next, Ivory Glaze.

12
00:00:25,665 --> 00:00:29,468
To be honest, I think this outfit leaves me quite underwhelmed.

13
00:00:29,568 --> 00:00:30,770
Viñas DeLuxe.

14
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:32,638
You must not be hungry

15
00:00:32,638 --> 00:00:34,073
because, bitch, you ate.

16
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:35,274
Kitty Space.

17
00:00:35,274 --> 00:00:36,942
I love that outfit.

18
00:00:37,343 --> 00:00:39,345
It's polished from head to toe.

19
00:00:39,445 --> 00:00:40,846
Viñas DeLuxe.

20
00:00:40,846 --> 00:00:42,248
Kitty Space.

21
00:00:42,448 --> 00:00:46,385
Condragulations, you are the Top 2 Slaysians of the week.

22
00:00:46,686 --> 00:00:48,320
Arizona Brandy

23
00:00:48,454 --> 00:00:49,922
and Ivory Glaze,

24
00:00:50,089 --> 00:00:51,323
you are both in the bottom.

25
00:00:52,391 --> 00:00:54,160
I'm so embarrassed.

26
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,327
Because...

27
00:00:55,327 --> 00:00:58,030
I was just at the top and then,

28
00:00:58,097 --> 00:01:00,266
I fell again, here.

29
00:01:00,266 --> 00:01:02,568
I know if I eliminate Arizona,

30
00:01:02,568 --> 00:01:03,602
she will be mad.

31
00:01:03,636 --> 00:01:06,338
And because it's a Pinoy queen,

32
00:01:06,372 --> 00:01:07,807
The time has come

33
00:01:07,873 --> 00:01:09,608
for you to Lip Sync

34
00:01:09,608 --> 00:01:12,845
for your Legacy!

35
00:01:12,978 --> 00:01:14,246
Viñas DeLuxe,

36
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:16,782
you’re a winner baby!

37
00:01:17,083 --> 00:01:20,486
Which queen have you chosen to get the karate chop?

38
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,254
Ivory.

39
00:01:23,322 --> 00:01:25,391
Thank you, Ivory Glaze.

40
00:01:25,391 --> 00:01:26,926
Now, sashay away.

41
00:01:29,361 --> 00:01:30,463
Aww.

42
00:01:32,331 --> 00:01:32,965
Oh, my God.

43
00:01:32,965 --> 00:01:36,035
Ivory Glaze, my sister from Down Under!

44
00:01:36,035 --> 00:01:38,070
It is sad to see her go.

45
00:01:38,104 --> 00:01:40,473
It's a great Aussie proverb.

46
00:01:40,506 --> 00:01:42,708
- “Shit happens.”
- We love you Ivory.

47
00:01:42,708 --> 00:01:45,678
- I love you, Ivory.
- We love you.

48
00:01:45,678 --> 00:01:46,946
She mentioned that

49
00:01:46,946 --> 00:01:48,481
she felt like a weight was lifted off her chest.

50
00:01:48,481 --> 00:01:50,416
because she doesn't have to deal with the stress and all that.

51
00:01:50,449 --> 00:01:54,186
So, I'm so happy I get to relieve you from your troubles.

52
00:01:54,353 --> 00:01:56,088
Wow, you're so good at cleaning now!

53
00:01:56,088 --> 00:01:57,323
Right?

54
00:01:57,323 --> 00:01:58,624
Ivory, I think,

55
00:01:58,624 --> 00:02:01,060
You have made a difference, this time around.

56
00:02:01,093 --> 00:02:02,361
You have outdone yourself and

57
00:02:02,361 --> 00:02:04,196
that's the least we can say.

58
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:06,265
Congrats, Sister!

59
00:02:06,298 --> 00:02:08,067
Congrats, Sis!

60
00:02:08,067 --> 00:02:09,335
- Thank you, thank you.
- Congrats.

61
00:02:09,368 --> 00:02:10,269
Thank you so much.

62
00:02:10,402 --> 00:02:11,837
It's so

63
00:02:11,837 --> 00:02:13,606
fulfilling to see my design to

64
00:02:13,606 --> 00:02:14,540
look like that.

65
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:16,408
And I don't even believe that

66
00:02:16,442 --> 00:02:18,210
I did that, so I'm so happy.

67
00:02:18,244 --> 00:02:19,512
It's so beautiful.

68
00:02:19,545 --> 00:02:21,447
It is beautiful. It's really good, yeah.

69
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,316
Oh, my God, the pressure is on!

70
00:02:24,316 --> 00:02:25,885
Now that I'm at the top,

71
00:02:25,885 --> 00:02:27,486
I keep on thinking, "what's next?"

72
00:02:27,486 --> 00:02:29,321
Will I be one of the judges now? Kidding.

73
00:02:29,321 --> 00:02:30,990
That’s not what’s gonna happen.

74
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:32,324
So I have to maintain this streak.

75
00:02:32,358 --> 00:02:33,993
How about you, Kitty?

76
00:02:33,993 --> 00:02:35,494
- Yes, Kitty!
- How do you feel?

77
00:02:35,494 --> 00:02:37,363
- Congratulations as well.
- I'm really happy,

78
00:02:37,363 --> 00:02:39,365
you know, because I really wanted to win this challenge.

79
00:02:39,398 --> 00:02:41,000
- Yes.
- It means so much to me because

80
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,134
I love fashion and...

81
00:02:42,134 --> 00:02:42,968
I'm super happy because

82
00:02:42,968 --> 00:02:44,970
I got eliminated in episode three

83
00:02:45,004 --> 00:02:46,305
and now I'm in the top, on episode three.

84
00:02:46,305 --> 00:02:48,707
So it feels like revenge

85
00:02:48,707 --> 00:02:50,976
- to be in the top!
- It's a full circle moment

86
00:02:50,976 --> 00:02:51,911
- for you!
- Yes!

87
00:02:51,911 --> 00:02:53,846
- Congratulations, Kitty!
- Congratulations!

88
00:02:53,846 --> 00:02:55,614
So, whose lipstick did you choose,

89
00:02:55,614 --> 00:02:57,883
- Miss Meow Meow?
- We wanna know.

90
00:02:58,217 --> 00:03:00,019
That was super difficult to me,

91
00:03:00,019 --> 00:03:01,954
because I love you both.

92
00:03:01,954 --> 00:03:03,589
I chose...

93
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:06,091
Arizona...

94
00:03:09,128 --> 00:03:10,262
Wait.

95
00:03:11,497 --> 00:03:12,731
I was the one you voted out?

96
00:03:12,731 --> 00:03:14,500
So you wanna play this game?

97
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,302
And this is how you wanna play it?

98
00:03:16,302 --> 00:03:17,303
Just you wait.

99
00:03:19,972 --> 00:03:21,574
Maybe I should have just let Kitty win.

100
00:03:24,977 --> 00:03:26,178
Because

101
00:03:26,212 --> 00:03:27,847
Ivory is really my friend.

102
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,815
Like, I am closer to her.

103
00:03:30,449 --> 00:03:31,817
I call bullshit.

104
00:03:31,817 --> 00:03:33,252
These bitches are full of shit.

105
00:03:33,252 --> 00:03:34,220
about being close.

106
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:36,088
They haven’t know each other that long, how can they be that close?

107
00:03:36,088 --> 00:03:37,489
Are you kidding me?

108
00:03:37,556 --> 00:03:39,758
And Kitty Space reveals her lipstick,

109
00:03:39,758 --> 00:03:40,726
and it’s Arizona?

110
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:42,361
Oh, my God.

111
00:03:42,361 --> 00:03:44,196
I thought we’re going by track record?

112
00:03:44,196 --> 00:03:45,664
are you fucking shit uped already?

113
00:03:46,065 --> 00:03:48,434
This could really settle the competition in a different way.

114
00:03:49,101 --> 00:03:51,270
So you're all playing sister sister, huh?

115
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:55,007
So if it's a Filipino queen versus an International queen,

116
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,242
and the Filipino queen wins,

117
00:03:56,242 --> 00:03:58,077
should we play the sister card too?

118
00:03:59,979 --> 00:04:00,946
Babe,

119
00:04:00,946 --> 00:04:02,214
don't try us.

120
00:04:02,248 --> 00:04:03,449
Don't be mad at me.

121
00:04:03,482 --> 00:04:04,950
I'm not mad, sis.

122
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:05,751
I understand.

123
00:04:05,751 --> 00:04:06,785
I told you that

124
00:04:06,785 --> 00:04:08,520
I will respect your choice.

125
00:04:08,554 --> 00:04:10,389
But that would be noted,

126
00:04:10,556 --> 00:04:11,991
in the future.

127
00:04:13,859 --> 00:04:15,427
And all the Pinoy queens were like...

128
00:04:16,362 --> 00:04:17,930
Don't act like this. Because when

129
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:18,964
Yoko was eliminated,

130
00:04:18,998 --> 00:04:20,332
when Sum Ting Wong was eliminated,

131
00:04:20,366 --> 00:04:21,867
you didn't react like this.

132
00:04:22,001 --> 00:04:23,202
And we didn't react like...

133
00:04:24,336 --> 00:04:25,671
“Khianna, you chose Yoko.

134
00:04:25,671 --> 00:04:26,739
It's not good.”

135
00:04:26,739 --> 00:04:29,341
No, we are more like...

136
00:04:29,408 --> 00:04:30,776
We didn't react too much.

137
00:04:30,776 --> 00:04:31,877
This just proves that

138
00:04:31,877 --> 00:04:33,545
the competition is, like,

139
00:04:33,545 --> 00:04:34,580
anyone's game.

140
00:04:34,613 --> 00:04:36,982
But I will make sure, that next week

141
00:04:37,283 --> 00:04:38,384
will be mine.

142
00:04:38,717 --> 00:04:39,718
Thank you!

143
00:04:40,219 --> 00:04:44,189
THANK YOU!

144
00:04:44,189 --> 00:04:45,858
Let's de-drag, ladies!

145
00:04:45,858 --> 00:04:48,761
Let's go.

146
00:04:48,761 --> 00:04:50,195
It's been a long day.

147
00:04:50,195 --> 00:04:51,430
Kitty!

148
00:04:51,463 --> 00:04:51,997
It's okay.

149
00:04:52,298 --> 00:04:53,365
It's no problem.

150
00:04:53,365 --> 00:04:54,967
I understand, Sis.

151
00:04:55,234 --> 00:04:56,268
I think she should have

152
00:04:56,302 --> 00:04:57,803
thought of it, first,

153
00:04:57,803 --> 00:04:59,705
before picking my lipstick, because,

154
00:04:59,705 --> 00:05:01,740
I strike back hard.

155
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:06,879
I really love you. I really admire you, you know?

156
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:07,780
I just, like...

157
00:05:09,748 --> 00:05:11,650
That's okay. It's okay.

158
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:13,919
If somebody doesn't want me here,

159
00:05:14,086 --> 00:05:15,354
I'm gonna send them home.

160
00:05:15,354 --> 00:05:17,089
I respect your decision.

161
00:05:17,122 --> 00:05:18,057
But I hate it.

162
00:05:26,231 --> 00:05:29,001
The winner of Drag Race Philippines: Slaysian Royale

163
00:05:29,001 --> 00:05:30,269
will receive a one-year supply of

164
00:05:30,269 --> 00:05:32,137

165
00:05:32,204 --> 00:05:34,239
A coveted spot on the Drag Race

166
00:05:34,239 --> 00:05:35,841
Slaysian Hall of Fame.

167
00:05:35,841 --> 00:05:36,842
And a cash prize of...

168
00:05:36,842 --> 00:05:38,377
2 Million Pesos!

169
00:05:38,377 --> 00:05:39,678
Powered by Bingo Plus!

170
00:05:39,678 --> 00:05:42,047
Tonight with our extra-special guest judges,

171
00:05:42,047 --> 00:05:43,782
Jervi “KaladKaren” Wrightson,

172
00:05:43,782 --> 00:05:44,316
and...

173
00:05:44,316 --> 00:05:45,918
Pangina Heals!

174
00:05:54,126 --> 00:05:56,628
Good morning!

175
00:05:56,662 --> 00:05:57,930
Mornings in the Werkroom.

176
00:05:57,963 --> 00:05:59,631
It's a new day again!

177
00:05:59,631 --> 00:06:00,966
I will do

178
00:06:00,966 --> 00:06:02,134
whatever I can do

179
00:06:02,167 --> 00:06:05,070
to make myself stay in another episode.

180
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:06,105
Yay!

181
00:06:06,171 --> 00:06:07,573
Are we gonna talk about, like,

182
00:06:07,573 --> 00:06:08,340
how we pick

183
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:10,676
- our lipsticks now?
- Yeah, I think we should talk about that.

184
00:06:10,709 --> 00:06:12,511
- Yeah, let's.
- It really brings in, you know,

185
00:06:12,544 --> 00:06:13,412
some spice.

186
00:06:13,412 --> 00:06:14,380
Your reason

187
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:15,881
for choosing my lipstick

188
00:06:15,914 --> 00:06:17,149
was she was your friend.

189
00:06:17,182 --> 00:06:18,951
If it was Bernie, would you choose her?

190
00:06:18,951 --> 00:06:21,320
I would still look at the track record,

191
00:06:21,353 --> 00:06:22,821
regardless if she's my friend.

192
00:06:22,855 --> 00:06:23,756
If she's done

193
00:06:23,756 --> 00:06:25,657
really bad on this competition,

194
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:27,159
I'm sending her home.

195
00:06:27,192 --> 00:06:28,460
I think it's common sense that

196
00:06:28,494 --> 00:06:29,928
it should be track record.

197
00:06:29,928 --> 00:06:31,830
However, when somebody already

198
00:06:31,864 --> 00:06:33,732
pulled the friendship card.

199
00:06:33,732 --> 00:06:34,600
So you know what?

200
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,835
There's no rules anymore.

201
00:06:36,869 --> 00:06:38,604
I don't want to follow that rule

202
00:06:38,604 --> 00:06:41,073
because that rule has already been broken.

203
00:06:41,073 --> 00:06:41,874
So next time,

204
00:06:41,874 --> 00:06:43,442
when we have an international queen,

205
00:06:43,442 --> 00:06:44,510
versus a Filipino friend,

206
00:06:44,543 --> 00:06:46,011
you're not going to pick your friends?

207
00:06:46,011 --> 00:06:47,546
- Is that what you're saying?
- Yeah.

208
00:06:49,181 --> 00:06:50,682
- Are you not going to save your sister?
- I don't know because-

209
00:06:50,716 --> 00:06:51,683
- Is that what you're saying?
- Yeah.

210
00:06:51,717 --> 00:06:52,885
But I don't know, ‘cause...

211
00:06:52,918 --> 00:06:53,986
she already did that.

212
00:06:53,986 --> 00:06:54,853
She started it.

213
00:06:54,887 --> 00:06:56,355
So... I might just as well.

214
00:06:56,688 --> 00:06:57,623
So, now you're changing.

215
00:06:57,656 --> 00:06:59,625
Now you're changing!

216
00:06:59,658 --> 00:07:01,093
I will never change.

217
00:07:01,126 --> 00:07:02,895
I will always pick friends.

218
00:07:02,928 --> 00:07:04,229
I want to win.

219
00:07:04,329 --> 00:07:05,998
And I know, competition is important.

220
00:07:06,031 --> 00:07:07,332
But I will never,

221
00:07:07,332 --> 00:07:09,101
never betray

222
00:07:09,101 --> 00:07:10,235
friends or family.

223
00:07:10,235 --> 00:07:11,603
It's Bernie's turn.

224
00:07:11,637 --> 00:07:14,039
What are you going to do to get critiqued?

225
00:07:14,073 --> 00:07:14,873
This time,

226
00:07:14,873 --> 00:07:16,075
I'll bring Bernie.

227
00:07:16,075 --> 00:07:17,376
All that I have.

228
00:07:17,876 --> 00:07:18,744
I'm bringing it now.

229
00:07:18,944 --> 00:07:20,446
Did you forget anything?

230
00:07:20,646 --> 00:07:21,113
No.

231
00:07:21,146 --> 00:07:22,815
Actually, I forgot my bra.

232
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:25,617
I'm anxious.

233
00:07:25,617 --> 00:07:26,985
Safe, safe, safe.

234
00:07:27,486 --> 00:07:28,554
I'm in trouble.

235
00:07:28,587 --> 00:07:30,456
I feel like a tag-along

236
00:07:30,489 --> 00:07:31,190
in the group.

237
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:32,758
I need to step up.

238
00:07:35,194 --> 00:07:37,563
She done already done had herses.

239
00:07:37,729 --> 00:07:39,731
Ooh, girl!

240
00:07:39,731 --> 00:07:42,334
She done already done had herses.

241
00:07:42,835 --> 00:07:44,269
Hello, hello, hello!

242
00:07:44,603 --> 00:07:47,339
My crazy bitch Slaysians!

243
00:07:47,339 --> 00:07:49,475
It's time to flex your throats

244
00:07:49,475 --> 00:07:51,743
and serve those notes.

245
00:07:52,144 --> 00:07:53,712
Now some people say

246
00:07:53,712 --> 00:07:55,214
"You'll never be good enough."

247
00:07:55,347 --> 00:07:56,715
So prove them wrong...

248
00:07:56,715 --> 00:07:57,583
...dead wrong.

249
00:07:58,183 --> 00:07:59,718
Break a leg!

250
00:07:59,718 --> 00:08:01,854
- Break a leg?
- Oh, my God!

251
00:08:01,854 --> 00:08:03,122
A wrestling challenge!

252
00:08:03,388 --> 00:08:05,657
Haller! Haller! Haller!

253
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:08,227
Oh, my God!

254
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,129
Mama Pao!

255
00:08:10,429 --> 00:08:11,964
Mama Pao!

256
00:08:12,231 --> 00:08:17,302
Mama Pao!

257
00:08:17,336 --> 00:08:18,470
Hi, Queens!

258
00:08:19,471 --> 00:08:20,906
Lucky 9 queens,

259
00:08:20,906 --> 00:08:22,875
smashing the competition.

260
00:08:22,908 --> 00:08:25,811
who's feeling lucky and auspicious?

261
00:08:26,011 --> 00:08:28,280
AUSPICIOUS?!

262
00:08:28,747 --> 00:08:30,349
And speaking of luck,

263
00:08:30,382 --> 00:08:31,884
let's see who's great

264
00:08:31,884 --> 00:08:33,585
at handling balls.

265
00:08:33,852 --> 00:08:35,387
And speaking of balls,

266
00:08:35,687 --> 00:08:36,989
Pit Crew!

267
00:08:41,393 --> 00:08:42,661
Oh, four!

268
00:08:43,629 --> 00:08:44,363
It's like a

269
00:08:44,363 --> 00:08:45,164
buffet.

270
00:08:45,197 --> 00:08:46,398
Good dinner.

271
00:08:46,465 --> 00:08:47,032
And I'm like,

272
00:08:47,032 --> 00:08:47,499
“Hmm.”

273
00:08:47,499 --> 00:08:48,367
We should pick one?

274
00:08:48,367 --> 00:08:50,002
Can I take the four? That's better.

275
00:08:50,002 --> 00:08:51,336
In this Mini Challenge,

276
00:08:51,336 --> 00:08:53,805
we'll be dropping balls in a game called

277
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:55,274
“Drop Balls!”

278
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:57,676
Presented to us by Bingo Plus,

279
00:08:57,709 --> 00:08:59,411
the country's most comprehensive

280
00:08:59,411 --> 00:09:01,046
digital entertainment platform,

281
00:09:01,079 --> 00:09:02,014
and the first

282
00:09:02,047 --> 00:09:04,983
live streaming bingo in the Philippines.

283
00:09:05,384 --> 00:09:07,219
Bingo for the fun, plus for the win!

284
00:09:07,719 --> 00:09:09,922
Bingo! Oh, my God!

285
00:09:09,922 --> 00:09:11,823
And I’m so excited to play this game!

286
00:09:11,823 --> 00:09:13,992
because I need to win something!

287
00:09:14,726 --> 00:09:15,994
Something! Something!

288
00:09:16,495 --> 00:09:17,829
Let’s see if I’m gonna win or not.

289
00:09:17,963 --> 00:09:19,231
In our Drop Ball Machine,

290
00:09:19,264 --> 00:09:21,633
you'll find the faces of our Pit Crew.

291
00:09:21,667 --> 00:09:22,668
You'll have to guess

292
00:09:22,668 --> 00:09:24,670
whose face the ball will land on

293
00:09:24,703 --> 00:09:25,571
when the ball drops.

294
00:09:25,604 --> 00:09:27,072
But, if the ball

295
00:09:27,105 --> 00:09:28,440
lands on my face,

296
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,276
you'll all get free Bingo Plus merch.

297
00:09:34,213 --> 00:09:35,581
The queen who guesses correctly,

298
00:09:35,614 --> 00:09:37,282
each time, wins.

299
00:09:37,316 --> 00:09:38,584
So, Queens,

300
00:09:38,584 --> 00:09:40,085
let's play!

301
00:09:40,085 --> 00:09:42,821
- Yeah!
- Yay!

302
00:09:43,855 --> 00:09:44,456
All right, Queens,

303
00:09:44,456 --> 00:09:46,225
let's drop some balls!

304
00:09:48,227 --> 00:09:49,328
So, now you have to choose

305
00:09:49,328 --> 00:09:50,395
which pit crew do you think

306
00:09:50,429 --> 00:09:51,463
the ball will land in.

307
00:09:51,463 --> 00:09:52,531
Go!

308
00:09:55,601 --> 00:09:56,401
Alright, line up.

309
00:09:56,435 --> 00:09:56,802
Line up.

310
00:09:56,802 --> 00:09:57,703
Let's drop the balls

311
00:09:57,736 --> 00:09:59,271
in 3, 2, 1!

312
00:10:06,979 --> 00:10:08,914
Landed on Dale!

313
00:10:08,914 --> 00:10:10,082
So all of you Queens,

314
00:10:10,082 --> 00:10:12,084
you're out!

315
00:10:15,787 --> 00:10:17,422
Well? That was quick!

316
00:10:17,422 --> 00:10:18,890
Basically everybody lost,

317
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:22,928
it’s up to Siam and Suki now, the two ‘S’ of this episode!

318
00:10:23,228 --> 00:10:24,496
Let's drop some balls!

319
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:25,631
Oh.

320
00:10:38,243 --> 00:10:39,645
Mama Pao!

321
00:10:39,945 --> 00:10:41,246
Mama Pao!

322
00:10:41,613 --> 00:10:43,048
Mama Pao!

323
00:10:43,282 --> 00:10:44,549
Mama Pao!

324
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:46,184
Mama Pao!

325
00:10:46,451 --> 00:10:48,253
It dropped on my face, so,

326
00:10:48,287 --> 00:10:48,954
for now,

327
00:10:48,987 --> 00:10:50,689
you get free Bingo Plus merch.

328
00:10:51,623 --> 00:10:53,125
Siam, and Suki Doll.

329
00:10:53,158 --> 00:10:54,426
Choose your Pit Crew.

330
00:10:54,459 --> 00:10:55,427
Choose Mama Pao!

331
00:10:55,427 --> 00:10:56,695
Yes, choose me, please.

332
00:10:56,728 --> 00:10:57,696
Suki Doll,

333
00:10:57,696 --> 00:10:59,931
I'm sorry my sister, my dear, but,

334
00:10:59,965 --> 00:11:01,400
I need to win this!

335
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:02,401
Okay?

336
00:11:02,434 --> 00:11:03,302
Give it to me!

337
00:11:03,335 --> 00:11:04,236
Alright.

338
00:11:04,236 --> 00:11:05,937
Drop the ball!

339
00:11:08,006 --> 00:11:11,677
Here we go!

340
00:11:14,846 --> 00:11:16,715
- We have a winner!
- Siam! Siam!

341
00:11:16,882 --> 00:11:19,584
- Siam! Siam!
- Hi, Siam!

342
00:11:19,618 --> 00:11:21,553
Mabuhay!

343
00:11:21,586 --> 00:11:22,020
Ah!

344
00:11:22,054 --> 00:11:23,355
So close to winning.

345
00:11:23,355 --> 00:11:24,690
Siam gets the win.

346
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:26,525
She's luckier than I am, I guess.

347
00:11:26,558 --> 00:11:27,693
Oh, my God!

348
00:11:27,726 --> 00:11:29,361
I win something,

349
00:11:29,361 --> 00:11:30,762
everybody!

350
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:32,698
It was a Mini Challenge,

351
00:11:32,698 --> 00:11:35,367
but I am so fucking proud that I'm the winner

352
00:11:35,634 --> 00:11:36,468
of something.

353
00:11:37,602 --> 00:11:39,604
You all have a way with balls.

354
00:11:39,638 --> 00:11:42,007
I love it, but only one hoe

355
00:11:42,007 --> 00:11:43,342
is good with holes.

356
00:11:43,508 --> 00:11:45,677
The winner of our Mini Challenge is,

357
00:11:45,711 --> 00:11:47,846
Siam Phusri!

358
00:11:49,348 --> 00:11:52,017
Thank you, you all.

359
00:11:52,684 --> 00:11:53,618
Now I have

360
00:11:53,652 --> 00:11:54,686
money.

361
00:11:56,054 --> 00:11:56,988
Condragulations!

362
00:11:56,988 --> 00:11:59,591
Because you will receive a cash tip of 20,000 pesos,

363
00:11:59,825 --> 00:12:01,326
brought to us by Bingo Plus.

364
00:12:01,326 --> 00:12:03,628
Bingo for the fun, plus for the win!

365
00:12:04,496 --> 00:12:06,465
But for the rest of you, don't be sad because

366
00:12:06,498 --> 00:12:08,667
Bingo Plus is generous.

367
00:12:09,568 --> 00:12:11,536
You will all have Bingo Plus merch

368
00:12:11,536 --> 00:12:13,238
so you'll get umbrellas,

369
00:12:13,271 --> 00:12:15,741
we have plushies as well, it's Bing Bing,

370
00:12:15,774 --> 00:12:16,842
tumblers,

371
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:17,976
and tote bags.

372
00:12:18,176 --> 00:12:22,614
- So everyone wins!
- Yay!

373
00:12:22,647 --> 00:12:23,582
My Queens.

374
00:12:23,615 --> 00:12:25,851
Let's now see how far

375
00:12:25,884 --> 00:12:27,786
luck is going to take you.

376
00:12:28,487 --> 00:12:29,454
Good luck.

377
00:12:29,755 --> 00:12:31,957
Will fortune favor you this week,

378
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:34,025
or are you going to be left

379
00:12:34,059 --> 00:12:35,927
singing a different tune?

380
00:12:36,828 --> 00:12:38,630
Because this week's Maxi Challenge is

381
00:12:38,663 --> 00:12:40,499
a Rusical!

382
00:12:43,435 --> 00:12:45,504
Get ready to be crazy!

383
00:12:45,537 --> 00:12:47,172
Channel your inner bitch,

384
00:12:47,205 --> 00:12:49,641
and serve the ultimate Slaysian fantasy.

385
00:12:49,841 --> 00:12:51,576
Because tomorrow, you'll be starring

386
00:12:51,576 --> 00:12:54,413
in a Rusical production entitled,

387
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,049
Crazy Bitch Slaysians.

388
00:12:59,618 --> 00:13:01,720
It's a Rusical!

389
00:13:01,753 --> 00:13:03,221
So let's sing,

390
00:13:03,221 --> 00:13:05,590
and dance it out, baby.

391
00:13:05,624 --> 00:13:06,725
Jazz hands!

392
00:13:06,725 --> 00:13:08,727
Siam Phusri, as the winner of our Mini Challenge,

393
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,996
you get to pick whatever role that you want.

394
00:13:10,996 --> 00:13:12,464
Ooh.

395
00:13:13,064 --> 00:13:15,434
But, that's not all.

396
00:13:15,467 --> 00:13:17,369
Power comes with responsibility.

397
00:13:17,369 --> 00:13:18,737
- My God.
- You have to give a queen

398
00:13:18,737 --> 00:13:20,739
- a disadvantage.
- Oh, my God.

399
00:13:20,739 --> 00:13:22,107
You will deny her right

400
00:13:22,107 --> 00:13:23,275
to choose for herself

401
00:13:23,308 --> 00:13:24,976
because she'll be taking whatever role

402
00:13:24,976 --> 00:13:26,545
that's left on the table.

403
00:13:26,578 --> 00:13:27,879
- What?
- Oh, my God.

404
00:13:27,946 --> 00:13:29,681
As for the rest of you, Queens,

405
00:13:29,714 --> 00:13:31,416
It's a free-for-all buffet.

406
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:33,084
so you have to fight for your role.

407
00:13:33,084 --> 00:13:35,387
And remember, there are no small roles,

408
00:13:35,387 --> 00:13:37,055
but only queens

409
00:13:37,055 --> 00:13:37,923
who slay big.

410
00:13:37,956 --> 00:13:40,659
So, I cannot wait to see your Rusical

411
00:13:40,759 --> 00:13:41,793
take over the Main Stage.

412
00:13:41,827 --> 00:13:43,195
And tomorrow on the Runway,

413
00:13:43,195 --> 00:13:44,129
category is

414
00:13:44,129 --> 00:13:46,364
“Happy Face-tival!”

415
00:13:48,033 --> 00:13:49,835
#SlaysianRoyale

416
00:13:49,901 --> 00:13:51,403
Racers, start your engines.

417
00:13:51,436 --> 00:13:54,339
And may the best Slaysian queen, win!

418
00:13:57,008 --> 00:13:59,144
Bye, Mama Pao!

419
00:13:59,544 --> 00:14:00,111
Good luck!

420
00:14:00,111 --> 00:14:01,346
Mama Pao!

421
00:14:01,413 --> 00:14:02,914
Mama Pao!

422
00:14:04,015 --> 00:14:07,352
Well, well, well.

423
00:14:07,352 --> 00:14:09,554
Yes! I love Rusicals!

424
00:14:09,554 --> 00:14:11,356
I have been doing theater

425
00:14:11,356 --> 00:14:13,492
for half of my life, so,

426
00:14:13,492 --> 00:14:15,160
I'm excited to show the world,

427
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,828
that I can do musicals,

428
00:14:16,828 --> 00:14:17,929
I can dance,

429
00:14:17,929 --> 00:14:19,731
and I can do it all at once.

430
00:14:19,731 --> 00:14:20,799
And...

431
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:22,033
This week is gonna be mine.

432
00:14:22,167 --> 00:14:23,168
Let's read the characters.

433
00:14:23,735 --> 00:14:24,369
Title.

434
00:14:24,369 --> 00:14:26,905
Crazy Bitch Slaysians: The Rusical

435
00:14:26,905 --> 00:14:28,974
Unveils the wedding of the century,

436
00:14:28,974 --> 00:14:30,208
where Raquel Achoo

437
00:14:30,442 --> 00:14:32,143
is set to marry Allan Masc,

438
00:14:32,177 --> 00:14:34,613
the heir of a billion-dollar empire.

439
00:14:34,613 --> 00:14:35,947
But chaos erupts

440
00:14:35,981 --> 00:14:37,315
when it's revealed that

441
00:14:37,349 --> 00:14:39,584
all the elite wedding guests,

442
00:14:39,618 --> 00:14:41,152
are Allan's exes.

443
00:14:41,186 --> 00:14:42,320
The first character,

444
00:14:42,354 --> 00:14:43,421
Raquel Achoo.

445
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:44,422
A westernized,

446
00:14:44,456 --> 00:14:46,691
upper middle class woman,

447
00:14:46,691 --> 00:14:48,727
who is way too English-speaking,

448
00:14:48,727 --> 00:14:50,161
for the rich Asian elite.

449
00:14:50,161 --> 00:14:52,264
Mrs. Chelle Yo-Masc.

450
00:14:52,297 --> 00:14:54,299
Allan's fierce, traditional,

451
00:14:54,332 --> 00:14:55,800
domineering dragon mom.

452
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,135
Lin-tek Lee.

453
00:14:57,135 --> 00:14:59,237
A nerdy tech mogul,

454
00:14:59,237 --> 00:15:00,805
and computer genius

455
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:02,774
always buried in her gadgets.

456
00:15:02,807 --> 00:15:04,175
Doja Park.

457
00:15:04,175 --> 00:15:05,911
A spoiled, over-the-top

458
00:15:05,944 --> 00:15:07,012
K-pop star.

459
00:15:07,045 --> 00:15:08,914
Chef Lee Cum Queen.

460
00:15:08,947 --> 00:15:09,848
Oh, girl.

461
00:15:09,848 --> 00:15:11,983
Ruthless, culinary tycoon,

462
00:15:11,983 --> 00:15:13,285
and chef and owner

463
00:15:13,318 --> 00:15:16,421
of the Lee Cum Queen Restaurant Empire.

464
00:15:16,555 --> 00:15:18,023
Master Jackie Ho.

465
00:15:18,023 --> 00:15:19,524
A warrior princess.

466
00:15:19,558 --> 00:15:20,992
Dr. Tammy Tak.

467
00:15:20,992 --> 00:15:23,228
Asia's most famous plastic surgeon.

468
00:15:23,261 --> 00:15:24,663
Liu Vuitong.

469
00:15:24,663 --> 00:15:26,998
A glamorous fashion mogul.

470
00:15:27,032 --> 00:15:28,867
Sister Mary Grace.

471
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,569
The quirky, deadpan

472
00:15:30,602 --> 00:15:32,571
officiant of the wedding,

473
00:15:32,571 --> 00:15:33,638
who narrates the story

474
00:15:33,672 --> 00:15:35,607
with sarcastic commentary.

475
00:15:36,308 --> 00:15:37,275
This is so fun.

476
00:15:37,275 --> 00:15:38,543
I mean, all the stereotype

477
00:15:38,543 --> 00:15:39,945
we do believe in,

478
00:15:39,978 --> 00:15:41,913
because we do have all these personas

479
00:15:41,913 --> 00:15:42,981
in our lives.

480
00:15:43,014 --> 00:15:44,249
So I'm excited to be

481
00:15:44,249 --> 00:15:45,884
one of them and portray it.

482
00:15:45,984 --> 00:15:47,786
- That was so good!
- I know, right?!

483
00:15:47,953 --> 00:15:49,821
The Rusical is incredible.

484
00:15:49,854 --> 00:15:50,655
So I thought,

485
00:15:50,655 --> 00:15:52,791
whatever character I get,

486
00:15:52,824 --> 00:15:53,992
I will try my best.

487
00:15:54,025 --> 00:15:55,360
As the saying goes,

488
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,495
There are no small roles,

489
00:15:57,529 --> 00:15:59,831
only small actors.

490
00:16:00,398 --> 00:16:01,366
Let's go. Let's decide!

491
00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:03,635
- Yes.
- Oh, my God.

492
00:16:04,102 --> 00:16:05,370
Do you guys have anything,

493
00:16:05,403 --> 00:16:06,871
a brand, that you want to

494
00:16:06,905 --> 00:16:08,073
show?

495
00:16:08,106 --> 00:16:09,174
- How about you?
- Who do you want?

496
00:16:09,207 --> 00:16:11,343
I would love to be like a bitchy one.

497
00:16:11,343 --> 00:16:13,178
And I never played the bitchy one.

498
00:16:13,211 --> 00:16:14,813
And I feel like the Liu Vuitong...

499
00:16:14,813 --> 00:16:17,015
- She's the bitchy one.
- Oh!

500
00:16:17,449 --> 00:16:18,650
Liu Vuitong.

501
00:16:18,683 --> 00:16:21,019
I would love to play her because

502
00:16:21,019 --> 00:16:22,087
I want to be rich.

503
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,755
I really wanna see myself in there.

504
00:16:24,322 --> 00:16:26,558
So Siam chooses Liu Vuitong,

505
00:16:26,558 --> 00:16:28,159
but she is very different,

506
00:16:28,193 --> 00:16:29,361
personality-wise.

507
00:16:29,394 --> 00:16:30,996
I don't know how this is going to translate,

508
00:16:31,029 --> 00:16:32,163
but she does want a challenge,

509
00:16:32,197 --> 00:16:33,398
and it'll be challenging.

510
00:16:33,465 --> 00:16:35,066
Sister, who are you giving

511
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,301
the disadvantage to?

512
00:16:36,334 --> 00:16:37,535
Who's going to pick last?

513
00:16:37,535 --> 00:16:39,371
I would love to be fair.

514
00:16:39,404 --> 00:16:41,206
And I know the person that I pick,

515
00:16:41,239 --> 00:16:42,874
she's gonna do good also.

516
00:16:47,112 --> 00:16:48,880
She already has RuBadges!

517
00:16:49,247 --> 00:16:50,515
Viñas already has

518
00:16:50,515 --> 00:16:51,316
two RuBadges.

519
00:16:51,349 --> 00:16:52,917
I feel like, she's very good.

520
00:16:52,951 --> 00:16:53,818
She's really smart.

521
00:16:53,818 --> 00:16:55,186
She's going to

522
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:57,122
do well whatever

523
00:16:57,122 --> 00:16:58,189
role we give to her.

524
00:16:58,223 --> 00:16:59,958
- You're gonna do good in anything.
- If I win,

525
00:16:59,991 --> 00:17:01,226
I'm gonna miss you.

526
00:17:02,694 --> 00:17:05,797
- I'll miss you, too.
- I'm just kidding.

527
00:17:06,297 --> 00:17:08,066
I guess she just really had to do it,

528
00:17:08,066 --> 00:17:10,669
I mean, I do have two RuBadges now, and

529
00:17:10,669 --> 00:17:12,070
maybe she's getting jealous. Kidding!

530
00:17:13,838 --> 00:17:15,807
Who wants the lead role?

531
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,876
I want Raquel Achoo.

532
00:17:17,909 --> 00:17:20,545
Brigiding's the only one who wants Raquel Achoo?

533
00:17:20,845 --> 00:17:22,614
- Does anyone want that?
- Nobody wants it.

534
00:17:23,548 --> 00:17:25,583
Right there and then,

535
00:17:25,617 --> 00:17:27,552
I picked Raquel Achoo immediately.

536
00:17:27,552 --> 00:17:29,354
Actually, I wanted Doja Park.

537
00:17:29,487 --> 00:17:30,255
Okay, go.

538
00:17:30,288 --> 00:17:32,057
I guess I can do Master Jackie Ho,

539
00:17:32,057 --> 00:17:33,358
- and you can do Doja Cat.
- Park.

540
00:17:33,391 --> 00:17:34,626
Okay. Doja Cat, right?

541
00:17:34,659 --> 00:17:35,827
- Doja Cat or Doja Park?
- Doja Park.

542
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:39,164
- Next character is Chef Lee Cum Queen.
- Lee Cum Queen.

543
00:17:39,831 --> 00:17:41,466
If nobody wants this,

544
00:17:41,499 --> 00:17:42,767
I can take it,

545
00:17:42,801 --> 00:17:43,835
I think.

546
00:17:43,868 --> 00:17:45,003
But I really want

547
00:17:45,036 --> 00:17:47,205
Dr. Tammy Tak, so I'm gonna wait.

548
00:17:47,205 --> 00:17:48,339
- You do that.
- Oh, I can be Chef.

549
00:17:48,373 --> 00:17:49,240
I can be Chef.

550
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,176
- I love the song
- You want it?

551
00:17:51,176 --> 00:17:51,543
Okay,

552
00:17:51,543 --> 00:17:52,277
Okay, we have Chef Lee Cum Queen.

553
00:17:52,444 --> 00:17:53,378
I love the Chef

554
00:17:53,378 --> 00:17:54,746
because I love this song,

555
00:17:54,746 --> 00:17:57,215
and I love to cook, so...

556
00:17:57,415 --> 00:17:58,817
I think it's a good character

557
00:17:58,817 --> 00:18:00,485
for me, and I can do it well.

558
00:18:00,485 --> 00:18:03,555
Okay, Mrs. Chelle Yo-Masc is open.

559
00:18:03,688 --> 00:18:04,389
Who wants it?

560
00:18:04,389 --> 00:18:05,123
You want to go?

561
00:18:05,156 --> 00:18:06,891
- Actually, I want to go also...
- Love it.

562
00:18:06,891 --> 00:18:08,727
So you want to go, and you want to go?

563
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:09,394
Who else?

564
00:18:09,427 --> 00:18:10,095
How do we do this?

565
00:18:10,095 --> 00:18:11,796
Rock, paper, scissors? Role acting?

566
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:12,363
What are we doing?

567
00:18:12,397 --> 00:18:13,465
- Role acting.
- We can act.

568
00:18:13,465 --> 00:18:14,265
We're gonna act.

569
00:18:14,299 --> 00:18:16,701
I have to audition for my role,

570
00:18:16,701 --> 00:18:17,736
but I can see why.

571
00:18:17,736 --> 00:18:19,571
Because we want the best, for the best.

572
00:18:19,571 --> 00:18:21,139
I do want this Rusical

573
00:18:21,139 --> 00:18:22,407
to be a success.

574
00:18:22,407 --> 00:18:24,609
So Yuhua also wants the same role as me.

575
00:18:24,609 --> 00:18:27,078
We will fight to the death for this one.

576
00:18:27,512 --> 00:18:29,114
You need to know your place.

577
00:18:29,147 --> 00:18:29,981
This wedding

578
00:18:30,014 --> 00:18:31,483
is a big disgrace.

579
00:18:31,483 --> 00:18:32,550
You don't fit in.

580
00:18:33,485 --> 00:18:34,119
No shade.

581
00:18:34,753 --> 00:18:35,787
WERK!

582
00:18:36,988 --> 00:18:38,256
- I'm pregnant!
- Yeah, where is it?

583
00:18:38,289 --> 00:18:39,858
We let them play the role

584
00:18:39,891 --> 00:18:40,925
and vote.

585
00:18:40,959 --> 00:18:42,460
This is what I love.

586
00:18:42,527 --> 00:18:44,195
My Asian Queens,

587
00:18:44,229 --> 00:18:46,331
we made the best decision.

588
00:18:46,364 --> 00:18:48,299
Let them do it, and then we vote.

589
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:50,268
- It's Yuhua's turn, let's go.
- Okay.

590
00:18:50,301 --> 00:18:52,771
You need to know your fucking place.

591
00:18:53,371 --> 00:18:54,305
This wedding

592
00:18:54,539 --> 00:18:56,407
is a big disgrace.

593
00:18:56,407 --> 00:18:57,609
You don't fit in.

594
00:18:57,642 --> 00:18:58,977
No shade.

595
00:19:01,246 --> 00:19:03,648
Umm, I feel like we don't have a winner.

596
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:07,852
Okay, let's decide one by one.

597
00:19:08,186 --> 00:19:10,155
And then the final decision is yours, Siam.

598
00:19:10,155 --> 00:19:12,590
- Who's yours?
- For me, Suki Doll.

599
00:19:12,624 --> 00:19:14,125
I think Suki, as well.

600
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:14,793
Suki.

601
00:19:14,793 --> 00:19:16,694
Oh, okay. Then it's Suki's.

602
00:19:16,694 --> 00:19:17,862
- Sorry, babes.
- You were giving theater,

603
00:19:17,896 --> 00:19:18,830
I was giving TV.

604
00:19:18,863 --> 00:19:20,265
But it's all good.

605
00:19:20,532 --> 00:19:22,167
Well, see, this is a theater piece.

606
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,735
Suki's getting the role.

607
00:19:23,768 --> 00:19:25,069
Because she looks more...

608
00:19:25,069 --> 00:19:26,004
motherly?

609
00:19:27,238 --> 00:19:28,540
Yuhua looks more like an auntie.

610
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:29,607
She doesn't look like a mother.

611
00:19:29,607 --> 00:19:31,242
I'll do Tammy then, I guess.

612
00:19:31,242 --> 00:19:32,277
I'll do Tammy.

613
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:33,077
You'll do Tammy?

614
00:19:33,111 --> 00:19:35,079
I resonated with

615
00:19:35,079 --> 00:19:35,847
Tammy Tak.

616
00:19:35,847 --> 00:19:37,982
I wanna try to be funny, for once.

617
00:19:37,982 --> 00:19:40,118
Because I've always been a beauty queen.

618
00:19:40,151 --> 00:19:42,487
I want the Tammy Tak role.

619
00:19:42,887 --> 00:19:43,655
Okay!

620
00:19:43,688 --> 00:19:45,690
Good evening, everyone.

621
00:19:45,723 --> 00:19:47,358
I am Dr. Tammy Tak.

622
00:19:47,358 --> 00:19:48,793
Hello, it's nice to meet you.

623
00:19:48,827 --> 00:19:50,295
Thank you.

624
00:19:51,663 --> 00:19:52,764
You do it, Sister.

625
00:19:53,064 --> 00:19:54,465
Hello, it's nice to meet you!

626
00:19:54,465 --> 00:19:55,934
I'm Dr. Tammy Tak.

627
00:19:55,934 --> 00:19:57,335
Breast enhancement,

628
00:19:57,335 --> 00:19:59,337
facial contour, lip fillers,

629
00:19:59,337 --> 00:20:01,372
tummy tuck, yeah!

630
00:20:02,974 --> 00:20:04,075
Okay, let's vote!

631
00:20:04,342 --> 00:20:05,410
I'm gonna vote for her.

632
00:20:05,443 --> 00:20:07,045
- Okay.
- Yuhua.

633
00:20:07,045 --> 00:20:08,446
- Me too, it's Yuhua.
- Yuhua.

634
00:20:08,913 --> 00:20:09,681
Yeah.

635
00:20:10,315 --> 00:20:11,649
I don't have to audition again.

636
00:20:11,683 --> 00:20:13,618
Thank the Lord Jesus.

637
00:20:13,651 --> 00:20:16,154
- She has to decide now.
- For now, I'll get Lin-tek Lee.

638
00:20:16,187 --> 00:20:18,189
Because I think I can also turn her out.

639
00:20:18,189 --> 00:20:19,023
Okay.

640
00:20:19,057 --> 00:20:20,458
So I'll get Lin-Tek Lee.

641
00:20:20,558 --> 00:20:21,793
The selection process was overwhelming.

642
00:20:21,793 --> 00:20:23,895
Everybody's like looking for the best

643
00:20:23,895 --> 00:20:25,296
roles for themselves

644
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:26,664
and I can't even

645
00:20:26,698 --> 00:20:27,699
say a thing.

646
00:20:27,899 --> 00:20:29,000
The last character is

647
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,101
Sister Mary Grace.

648
00:20:30,134 --> 00:20:31,336
All of you has a character, right?

649
00:20:31,369 --> 00:20:31,803
Yes.

650
00:20:31,803 --> 00:20:33,371
Okay, I'm Sister Mary Grace.

651
00:20:33,371 --> 00:20:34,572
We're done!

652
00:20:34,572 --> 00:20:36,641
- Love it!
- Yes!

653
00:20:36,674 --> 00:20:39,244
My second choice is Chef Lee Cum Queen.

654
00:20:39,244 --> 00:20:41,179
Kitty, my good friend, Kitty,

655
00:20:41,179 --> 00:20:42,180
has that role.

656
00:20:42,213 --> 00:20:44,048
So I have to ask for a favor, like...

657
00:20:44,082 --> 00:20:45,917
"Would you want to switch with me?"

658
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:47,452
You can listen to both and

659
00:20:47,485 --> 00:20:49,087
then we decide.

660
00:20:49,087 --> 00:20:51,623
- No, but I really wanted the Chef.
- You just want the Chef.

661
00:20:51,656 --> 00:20:52,156
Okay.

662
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:54,192
Let me listen to it.

663
00:20:54,392 --> 00:20:56,761
Me too, I'm kind of still undecided.

664
00:20:56,861 --> 00:20:58,863
No, I’m already decided, but...

665
00:20:59,063 --> 00:21:00,632
Are you not happy with this?

666
00:21:01,032 --> 00:21:02,300
I really want the Chef.

667
00:21:05,136 --> 00:21:06,604
- Let me listen first.
- Okay, listen.

668
00:21:06,638 --> 00:21:08,039
I asked her politely,

669
00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:10,341
very politely, very courteously,

670
00:21:10,375 --> 00:21:11,709
to switch roles with me,

671
00:21:11,743 --> 00:21:13,044
and she said yes.

672
00:21:13,244 --> 00:21:15,246
This is me, apologizing to you,

673
00:21:15,246 --> 00:21:15,880
for what I did to you,

674
00:21:15,914 --> 00:21:17,615
I'll give you the role and I'm okay with

675
00:21:17,615 --> 00:21:18,783
the Britney Spears.

676
00:21:18,783 --> 00:21:21,519
- No, sister, I don't want you to do that.
- So I'm giving it to you.

677
00:21:21,552 --> 00:21:22,487
No, it's fine.

678
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:24,322
- I'm okay, I listened.
- But I'm fine...

679
00:21:24,355 --> 00:21:25,290
You're fine with the song?

680
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:27,025
Sure. Because I love Britney Spears and I also

681
00:21:27,025 --> 00:21:28,092
can fit the role.

682
00:21:28,393 --> 00:21:29,861
I am okay with all characters

683
00:21:29,861 --> 00:21:31,562
So if you can't do another character,

684
00:21:31,562 --> 00:21:32,797
I'll do another character.

685
00:21:32,797 --> 00:21:33,564
It's fine.

686
00:21:33,731 --> 00:21:34,899
Thank you. My God.

687
00:21:34,899 --> 00:21:35,967
Look at them hugging and all,

688
00:21:36,301 --> 00:21:38,469
they will be picking each other's lipsticks in the end.

689
00:21:39,938 --> 00:21:41,105
Teacher!

690
00:21:41,539 --> 00:21:42,607
It’s time to rehearse for the

691
00:21:42,607 --> 00:21:44,309
Crazy Bitch Slaysian!

692
00:21:44,309 --> 00:21:46,177
So teacher Cecile is giving us this

693
00:21:46,177 --> 00:21:48,680
Easy breezy teaching skill sets

694
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:51,749
so I’m very excited how it comes on stage.

695
00:21:51,916 --> 00:21:53,117
It's a lot of work.

696
00:21:53,151 --> 00:21:54,752
Let's have fun building it

697
00:21:54,786 --> 00:21:55,920
- together.
- Yes.

698
00:21:55,954 --> 00:21:57,388
Okay, Raquel,

699
00:21:57,388 --> 00:21:58,589
let's do this!

700
00:21:58,589 --> 00:22:00,992
Remind the guests, strictly black

701
00:22:01,025 --> 00:22:02,660
- tie.
- Strictly black tie.

702
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:03,494
Call the caterers.

703
00:22:03,528 --> 00:22:04,629
Get the garters.

704
00:22:04,629 --> 00:22:05,530
Get the garters.

705
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:06,197
Call the—

706
00:22:06,197 --> 00:22:07,231
The photographers.

707
00:22:07,265 --> 00:22:09,567
I really want to be part of everybody's story

708
00:22:09,567 --> 00:22:11,035
because it's my wedding.

709
00:22:11,035 --> 00:22:12,470
I have to be everywhere.

710
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:13,738
I have to be the one

711
00:22:13,771 --> 00:22:15,073
at the center of the plot.

712
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:16,741
Remind the guests!

713
00:22:16,975 --> 00:22:18,009
Remind the guests!

714
00:22:18,476 --> 00:22:19,944
You can add your own flair, okay?

715
00:22:19,978 --> 00:22:21,279
- Okay.
- You can add your own flair.

716
00:22:21,446 --> 00:22:22,747
I took it as a challenge,

717
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:24,882
to show everybody,

718
00:22:24,882 --> 00:22:26,517
and the judges, that

719
00:22:26,551 --> 00:22:28,286
I am really here to show off

720
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:29,354
what I can really do.

721
00:22:29,487 --> 00:22:30,521
Viral!

722
00:22:37,462 --> 00:22:39,263
I still haven't figured out what I was gonna do

723
00:22:39,297 --> 00:22:40,598
because I was panicking already.

724
00:22:40,598 --> 00:22:42,834
So I was like, stay here, get in position...

725
00:22:42,867 --> 00:22:44,235
I need a plan.

726
00:22:44,268 --> 00:22:46,337
I really need to figure out what to do.

727
00:22:46,371 --> 00:22:48,172
Think, Bernie. Think.

728
00:22:48,172 --> 00:22:49,407
We are good.

729
00:22:49,507 --> 00:22:51,943
This, and then lift.

730
00:22:52,243 --> 00:22:54,512
I want to be lifted by dancers to be more

731
00:22:54,512 --> 00:22:55,380
campy, you know?

732
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:57,415
Because I'm playing a girl who

733
00:22:57,415 --> 00:22:59,050
thinks she's more intelligent than the others.

734
00:22:59,083 --> 00:22:59,517
So I'm like,

735
00:22:59,517 --> 00:23:00,351
oh, I'm elevated,

736
00:23:00,385 --> 00:23:01,552
I'm more intelligent.

737
00:23:01,819 --> 00:23:03,955
I'm the beauty.

738
00:23:04,122 --> 00:23:06,024
Oops!

739
00:23:07,125 --> 00:23:08,192
No, we can practice that.

740
00:23:08,192 --> 00:23:09,060
We can practice that.

741
00:23:09,093 --> 00:23:10,361
She's not doing so well

742
00:23:10,395 --> 00:23:12,830
and she needs to do some extra work overnight.

743
00:23:13,498 --> 00:23:14,966
I was happy, I was confident. Because

744
00:23:14,999 --> 00:23:17,001
the choreo was not really bad,

745
00:23:17,035 --> 00:23:18,102
not really difficult.

746
00:23:18,369 --> 00:23:19,871
So, I was good.

747
00:23:19,904 --> 00:23:20,772
For me,

748
00:23:20,805 --> 00:23:23,174
Chef Lee Cum's character,

749
00:23:23,207 --> 00:23:25,576
is a respectable woman,

750
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:26,244
at first.

751
00:23:26,244 --> 00:23:29,047
But I feel like her lyrics have sexual innuendos.

752
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,014
Okay.

753
00:23:30,014 --> 00:23:31,482
So as the song keeps going, I want her to get more like...

754
00:23:31,482 --> 00:23:32,550
It's so fresh.

755
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:33,551
It's so fresh.

756
00:23:33,551 --> 00:23:35,653
My plan for the character is,

757
00:23:35,686 --> 00:23:38,322
she's gonna start off very matronly.

758
00:23:38,322 --> 00:23:39,457
And then, she's gonna be

759
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:41,192
wild and wild and wild!

760
00:23:41,426 --> 00:23:42,727
So I'll be targetting

761
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,095
- his crotch.
- Yeah, that works.

762
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:45,863
Right? You know what I mean?

763
00:23:45,897 --> 00:23:47,365
Arizona really is

764
00:23:47,398 --> 00:23:48,533
a big threat.

765
00:23:48,533 --> 00:23:50,068
The bitch is really good.

766
00:23:50,068 --> 00:23:52,570
And if there's someone who can take on the big roles,

767
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:54,572
even if all the roles of the exes are supposed to be equal,

768
00:23:54,572 --> 00:23:56,607
she makes hers feel like the strongest character.

769
00:23:56,674 --> 00:23:57,909
Oh, yours is easy.

770
00:23:57,909 --> 00:23:58,676
Just make sure you

771
00:23:58,676 --> 00:24:00,378
feel all the

772
00:24:00,411 --> 00:24:02,113
- The lyrics.
- Yeah, the lyrics.

773
00:24:02,146 --> 00:24:03,314
Everyone has their choreo.

774
00:24:03,314 --> 00:24:04,449
But...

775
00:24:04,449 --> 00:24:05,616
I don't have it.

776
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:06,651
But I understand why.

777
00:24:06,684 --> 00:24:08,586
Maybe my section

778
00:24:08,619 --> 00:24:10,655
has to be more emotional.

779
00:24:10,688 --> 00:24:11,522
Okay!

780
00:24:11,556 --> 00:24:12,757
I will play the drama

781
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:14,792
that I think works for me.

782
00:24:16,227 --> 00:24:17,662
Not your face. Your tummy.

783
00:24:17,695 --> 00:24:19,831
I think I'm very nervous for Siam.

784
00:24:19,864 --> 00:24:23,000
Siam had the most climactic scene

785
00:24:23,034 --> 00:24:24,469
and she's the villainous type

786
00:24:24,469 --> 00:24:26,104
of character, so I think

787
00:24:26,137 --> 00:24:28,272
she needs to put more to it.

788
00:24:28,306 --> 00:24:29,006
Good.

789
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,608
For some general notes.

790
00:24:30,608 --> 00:24:32,743
If you don't know the steps well,

791
00:24:32,743 --> 00:24:34,245
you have time to memorize.

792
00:24:34,278 --> 00:24:36,013
Again, here in your Rusical,

793
00:24:36,047 --> 00:24:37,115
you are competing

794
00:24:37,148 --> 00:24:38,282
against the other queens

795
00:24:38,316 --> 00:24:40,151
for the love of the groom.

796
00:24:40,151 --> 00:24:42,186
Everyone really did great today.

797
00:24:42,553 --> 00:24:43,187
Okay!

798
00:24:43,421 --> 00:24:46,257
Good job, everyone.

799
00:24:50,194 --> 00:24:53,197
It's a new day in the Werkroom!

800
00:24:53,731 --> 00:24:56,067
- Are you excited?
- Yeah!

801
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,302
It’s a new day in the Werkroom!

802
00:24:58,302 --> 00:25:00,471
and it’s anybody’s chance to be on the top!

803
00:25:00,471 --> 00:25:01,539
and win!

804
00:25:01,939 --> 00:25:03,908
For the International queens,

805
00:25:03,941 --> 00:25:04,675
You didn't know, but,

806
00:25:04,675 --> 00:25:06,377
Brigiding was the number one drag queen

807
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:09,347
in the Philippines, before Drag Race.

808
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:10,715
Everybody should know that.

809
00:25:10,715 --> 00:25:11,682
She's the most famous

810
00:25:11,716 --> 00:25:13,351
- drag queen in the Philippines!
- Oh, really?

811
00:25:13,351 --> 00:25:15,520
She's known to be a celebrity make up artist.

812
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,421
Also, she's been doing

813
00:25:17,455 --> 00:25:19,657
theater plays, she's in the big

814
00:25:19,657 --> 00:25:22,760
shows, international and whatnot.

815
00:25:22,793 --> 00:25:24,195
You know what I just realized?

816
00:25:24,195 --> 00:25:26,430
I've gone to DragCon LA

817
00:25:26,464 --> 00:25:27,365
all the time,

818
00:25:27,365 --> 00:25:28,866
but I've never seen you.

819
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:29,734
Because I've met

820
00:25:29,734 --> 00:25:31,736
all your other sisters except you.

821
00:25:33,604 --> 00:25:35,239
There was a time before

822
00:25:35,239 --> 00:25:36,374
where...

823
00:25:36,407 --> 00:25:39,343
I went to LA and got

824
00:25:39,343 --> 00:25:40,611
asked to return

825
00:25:40,645 --> 00:25:41,512
to the Philippines.

826
00:25:41,512 --> 00:25:43,047
So I didn't get through.

827
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,049
I didn't get through the immigration.

828
00:25:45,049 --> 00:25:45,816
Oh.

829
00:25:45,850 --> 00:25:48,352
Yeah, that was after Drag Race, when

830
00:25:48,386 --> 00:25:51,222
I felt so depressed and like...

831
00:25:51,422 --> 00:25:53,424
It got in my head so much

832
00:25:53,491 --> 00:25:54,458
that after Drag Race

833
00:25:54,492 --> 00:25:55,893
I wanted to find myself somewhere

834
00:25:55,927 --> 00:25:57,228
out of the Philippines.

835
00:25:57,261 --> 00:25:58,930
After my original season,

836
00:25:58,930 --> 00:26:00,231
I really had a hard time

837
00:26:00,264 --> 00:26:02,433
believing and telling myself

838
00:26:02,433 --> 00:26:05,069
that I have what it takes to be

839
00:26:05,369 --> 00:26:07,205
the best version of myself.

840
00:26:07,238 --> 00:26:10,741
During Season 1, I faced so many challenges,

841
00:26:10,741 --> 00:26:12,443
I faced so much

842
00:26:12,443 --> 00:26:13,978
discrimination.

843
00:26:13,978 --> 00:26:16,881
A lot of people looked down on me.

844
00:26:16,914 --> 00:26:18,583
Because of what they saw on the show.

845
00:26:18,583 --> 00:26:20,084
I wanted to quit drag,

846
00:26:20,251 --> 00:26:21,319
I didn't know what to do,

847
00:26:21,319 --> 00:26:22,286
I didn't know how to

848
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,655
go back to going to clubs and performing.

849
00:26:24,655 --> 00:26:26,524
When I went to America

850
00:26:26,557 --> 00:26:28,259
to find myself,

851
00:26:28,259 --> 00:26:30,127
I got deported back here.

852
00:26:30,127 --> 00:26:32,763
It felt like doors were closing and

853
00:26:32,797 --> 00:26:34,865
- Doors are never closing.
- I didn't know what to do.

854
00:26:34,899 --> 00:26:37,535
Imagine yourself trying to go

855
00:26:37,535 --> 00:26:38,936
for your dreams,

856
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:39,937
and then,

857
00:26:39,971 --> 00:26:41,072
you were not allowed.

858
00:26:41,105 --> 00:26:42,173
You were told that

859
00:26:42,206 --> 00:26:43,674
this is not the place for you.

860
00:26:43,708 --> 00:26:45,176
This is not where you belong.

861
00:26:45,343 --> 00:26:46,744
On Season 1,

862
00:26:46,744 --> 00:26:47,812
I was told that I'm

863
00:26:47,845 --> 00:26:48,746
always safe,

864
00:26:48,746 --> 00:26:50,548
I am fading in the background.

865
00:26:50,581 --> 00:26:51,849
Which was very

866
00:26:51,882 --> 00:26:53,084
painful at that time.

867
00:26:53,117 --> 00:26:54,986
Because I've always been trying my best

868
00:26:54,986 --> 00:26:56,287
to show off

869
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,688
and show the people who

870
00:26:57,688 --> 00:26:59,824
I really am and what I can really do.

871
00:26:59,857 --> 00:27:01,325
I had a hard time

872
00:27:01,359 --> 00:27:03,094
finding myself back.

873
00:27:03,127 --> 00:27:04,095
That's why whenever I'm

874
00:27:04,128 --> 00:27:06,731
on stage here, in Drag Race, now,

875
00:27:06,831 --> 00:27:08,466
it feels so special. And

876
00:27:08,499 --> 00:27:10,268
to see the judges

877
00:27:10,534 --> 00:27:12,670
smiling every Runway,

878
00:27:13,271 --> 00:27:14,272
it feels different

879
00:27:14,272 --> 00:27:16,841
because I've never seen those smiles before.

880
00:27:16,874 --> 00:27:18,609
I felt sad for Brigiding, that

881
00:27:18,643 --> 00:27:19,910
that's what she experienced.

882
00:27:19,944 --> 00:27:21,078
It's so different

883
00:27:21,078 --> 00:27:22,747
compared to what Precious and I experienced.

884
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:24,215
She struggled so much,

885
00:27:24,248 --> 00:27:26,083
it's like bad luck really fucked her.

886
00:27:26,884 --> 00:27:27,952
I know this is

887
00:27:27,952 --> 00:27:29,387
our chances back here

888
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:31,289
to prove ourselves to the world, that

889
00:27:31,322 --> 00:27:33,391
we are not what the audience saw

890
00:27:33,391 --> 00:27:34,992
during our season.

891
00:27:35,026 --> 00:27:36,294
We're not failures.

892
00:27:36,327 --> 00:27:38,829
We're not disappointments. We're not losers.

893
00:27:38,863 --> 00:27:40,097
We're winners and

894
00:27:40,097 --> 00:27:40,898
we just have to

895
00:27:40,931 --> 00:27:41,932
believe it and

896
00:27:41,966 --> 00:27:43,768
show them who we really are

897
00:27:43,768 --> 00:27:45,303
in the show and after the show.

898
00:27:45,903 --> 00:27:47,305
- Love it.
- Yeah.

899
00:27:47,338 --> 00:27:49,206
I'm very, very grateful that

900
00:27:49,206 --> 00:27:51,809
Drag Race Slaysian Royale,

901
00:27:51,842 --> 00:27:52,843
is seeing me.

902
00:27:53,311 --> 00:27:55,279
This competition is a beautiful thing

903
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,481
so let’s appreciate it and

904
00:27:57,481 --> 00:27:59,083
not take it too seriously.

905
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:00,918
So I'm very excited to tour around the world

906
00:28:00,918 --> 00:28:03,688
- with all of you girls.
- Yes!

907
00:28:29,313 --> 00:28:30,481
Mabuheeey!

908
00:28:30,481 --> 00:28:33,150
I am your mothertucking laundry lady,

909
00:28:33,317 --> 00:28:35,186
and welcome to the Main Stage of

910
00:28:35,219 --> 00:28:40,524
Drag Race Philippines: Slaysian Royale!

911
00:28:40,558 --> 00:28:43,227
The first Transgender Best Supporting Actress

912
00:28:43,227 --> 00:28:44,495
in the Philippines,

913
00:28:44,495 --> 00:28:47,365
and a resident judge on Drag Race Philippines.

914
00:28:47,398 --> 00:28:49,767
It's the one woman wonder, KaladKaren.

915
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:52,069
Mrs. Jervi Wrightson.

916
00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:53,237
Hi, Jervi.

917
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:54,739
Are you a fan of musicals?

918
00:28:54,805 --> 00:28:56,140
What is your favorite?

919
00:28:56,273 --> 00:28:57,208
Of course!

920
00:28:57,208 --> 00:28:59,410
And my favorite musical

921
00:28:59,443 --> 00:29:01,846
has so many notes.

922
00:29:02,146 --> 00:29:02,713
It is

923
00:29:02,713 --> 00:29:05,249
the Book of More-men!

924
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:07,451
That's my favorite too.

925
00:29:07,485 --> 00:29:09,520
Next to Fiddler on the Lube

926
00:29:09,587 --> 00:29:11,722
and Chitty Chitty Gang Bang!

927
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:13,891
Next up. Khop khun ka.

928
00:29:13,891 --> 00:29:15,960
Drag Race Thailand's very own,

929
00:29:15,993 --> 00:29:16,994
Pangina Heals.

930
00:29:17,027 --> 00:29:18,929
Hello!

931
00:29:18,963 --> 00:29:21,165
If you were in a musical, Panpan,

932
00:29:21,332 --> 00:29:23,000
what role would you live for?

933
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,368
Spill the Boba Tea.

934
00:29:24,368 --> 00:29:25,035
Ooh.

935
00:29:25,035 --> 00:29:27,204
Well, I think it would probably be

936
00:29:27,238 --> 00:29:28,806
be Roxy Hart from

937
00:29:28,839 --> 00:29:31,409
Chicago because it's a crime

938
00:29:31,442 --> 00:29:33,878
for us all to look so good.

939
00:29:33,878 --> 00:29:35,646
Oh, please.

940
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:36,981
Get me.

941
00:29:36,981 --> 00:29:38,849
Don't worry, the FBI is on standby.

942
00:29:38,883 --> 00:29:39,817
We called them.

943
00:29:40,117 --> 00:29:40,951
Tonight,

944
00:29:40,985 --> 00:29:42,520
our talented queens will walk us

945
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,320
down the aisle,

946
00:29:43,354 --> 00:29:44,822
in a uniquely Asian

947
00:29:44,822 --> 00:29:46,223
tale of love

948
00:29:46,257 --> 00:29:47,057
loss,

949
00:29:47,091 --> 00:29:49,193
and all kinds of lust.

950
00:29:49,193 --> 00:29:50,261
Get ready for their

951
00:29:50,261 --> 00:29:52,163

952
00:29:52,229 --> 00:29:54,365
Crazy Bitch Slaysians.

00:29:54,532 --> 00:29:56,567
And on the Runway, category is

00:29:56,767 --> 00:29:58,669
“Happy Face-tival.”

955
00:29:59,203 --> 00:30:01,639
Face-tival?!

956
00:30:03,908 --> 00:30:06,510
Racers, start your engines.

957
00:30:06,544 --> 00:30:08,946
And may the best Slaysian queen

958
00:30:08,979 --> 00:30:10,915

959
00:30:11,315 --> 00:30:13,350
Get ready to snatch the spotlight.

Because tonight,

961
00:30:14,285 --> 00:30:16,253
it's all about the drama,

962
00:30:16,253 --> 00:30:16,921
decadence,

963
00:30:16,954 --> 00:30:18,956
and diva realness in

00:30:18,989 --> 00:30:22,693

00:30:31,335 --> 00:30:33,237

No lilies.

974
00:30:54,024 --> 00:30:54,725
Tell the florist.

975
00:30:54,758 --> 00:30:56,227
Has the string quartet arrived?

976
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:57,995
Remind the guests, strictly black tie.

977
00:30:57,995 --> 00:30:58,829
Call the caterers.

992
00:31:24,655 --> 00:31:26,323
Dearly beloved,

993
00:31:26,357 --> 00:31:27,858
we are gathered here today

994
00:31:27,858 --> 00:31:31,495
to bless the union of Raquel and Allan.

995
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:33,497
If anyone here knows

996
00:31:33,497 --> 00:31:34,665
of any reason why

997
00:31:34,665 --> 00:31:38,002
these two should not be joined in holy matrimony,

998
00:31:38,035 --> 00:31:39,236
let them speak now

999
00:31:39,236 --> 00:31:41,472
or forever hold their peace.

1000
00:31:41,539 --> 00:31:43,007
I object!

1001
00:31:43,807 --> 00:31:45,042
Stop the wedding!

1002
00:31:45,075 --> 00:31:47,044
Stop the wedding!

00:31:47,444 --> 00:31:49,613
Stop the wedding!

00:31:51,415 --> 00:31:53,117
Stop the wedding!

1005
00:31:54,685 --> 00:31:57,154
Stop the wedding!

Listen up, let me plead my case.

1009
00:32:11,035 --> 00:32:14,138
Let me put that mid-queen in her place.

1010
00:32:14,138 --> 00:32:17,374
Give me my turn on that microphone.

1011
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:20,678
This wedding's about to get overthrown.

1012
00:32:20,711 --> 00:32:22,413
Let us read the house down.

1013
00:32:22,413 --> 00:32:24,114
From our roledex of hate.

1014
00:32:24,148 --> 00:32:25,883
Sashay away.

1015
00:32:25,883 --> 00:32:28,018
All tea, all shade.

1016
00:32:28,018 --> 00:32:28,886
1! 2!

1017
00:32:28,919 --> 00:32:29,320

00:32:36,327 --> 00:32:37,561
I object!

1023
00:32:40,764 --> 00:32:44,101
Miss Doja Park, why do you object this union?

1024
00:32:47,004 --> 00:32:53,210
I've got sponsorships and collabs with brands of every kind.

1025
00:32:53,644 --> 00:32:59,717
I've got a blue check on my profile and I didn’t subscribe.

1026
00:33:00,217 --> 00:33:06,323
Millions of people check online to see what I post next.

1027
00:33:06,757 --> 00:33:12,796
I rule Insta, Tiktok, Threads and Twitter I mean X.

1028
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:16,433
Cause I'm thriving in a viral world.

1029

Ho...

1041
00:33:51,035 --> 00:33:54,004
The world is dark and frightening.

1042
00:33:54,004 --> 00:33:54,872
Hah!

1043
00:33:55,272 --> 00:33:58,342
Full off lip sync assassins.

1044
00:33:58,375 --> 00:33:59,243
Hah!

1045
00:33:59,643 --> 00:34:02,713

Let me be your fighter.

00:34:31,675 --> 00:34:33,310
Spill your tea!

1057
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:38,348
I can solve a Rubix.

1058
00:34:38,348 --> 00:34:40,117
I can hack a site.

1059
00:34:40,217 --> 00:34:41,919
I can file your taxes.

Read a book overnight.

1061
00:34:44,188 --> 00:34:45,422
I'm smart bitch.

1062
00:34:47,958 --> 00:34:49,660
Calculus is easy.

1063
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:51,495
I’ve got five degrees

1064
00:34:51,862 --> 00:34:53,864

No complaints.

1070
00:35:04,208 --> 00:35:07,511
I'm the beauty and the brains.

1120
00:37:10,901 --> 00:37:11,702
To the bride.

1121
00:37:11,735 --> 00:37:12,703
To the bride.

1122
00:37:12,703 --> 00:37:13,370
To the bride.

1123
00:37:13,403 --> 00:37:15,505
And I’ve brought a gift.

1124
00:37:15,505 --> 00:37:16,874
She brought a gift.

1125
00:37:17,274 --> 00:37:18,475
It's a surprise.

1126
00:37:18,475 --> 00:37:21,478
Surprise, surprise, surprise!

1127
00:37:21,778 --> 00:37:22,913
Do you remember that night?

1128
00:37:22,946 --> 00:37:23,881
You remember that night

1129
00:37:23,881 --> 00:37:25,849
when you slept by my side?

1130
00:37:25,916 --> 00:37:27,784
I told you I was on the pill for a month.

1131
00:37:27,784 --> 00:37:28,452
Jokes on you,

1132
00:37:28,485 --> 00:37:29,720
I lied.

1133
00:37:29,753 --> 00:37:31,655
So here's my wedding gift to you and your bride.

1134
00:37:31,655 --> 00:37:33,357
What a surprise!

1135
00:37:33,357 --> 00:37:34,524
Here's the tea,

1136
00:37:34,524 --> 00:37:35,392
I took a test

1137
00:37:35,392 --> 00:37:38,128
and now I bear your child.

1138
00:37:38,195 --> 00:37:39,630
I'm pregnant.

1139
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:40,797
It's your child.

1140
00:37:40,797 --> 00:37:42,499
Your child, your child.

1141
00:37:42,699 --> 00:37:43,901
Your child.

1142
00:37:43,901 --> 00:37:44,835
Child.

1143
00:37:47,004 --> 00:37:48,505
Enough of this!

1144
00:37:49,473 --> 00:37:52,376
It was I who invited the exes.

1145
00:37:54,778 --> 00:37:55,746
Because you

1146
00:37:55,746 --> 00:37:58,115
will never be good enough

1147
00:37:59,416 --> 00:38:02,753
for him.

1148
00:38:05,222 --> 00:38:09,760
You need to know your place.

1149
00:38:11,662 --> 00:38:16,800
This wedding is a big disgrace.

1150
00:38:17,301 --> 00:38:20,037
You don't fit in.

1151
00:38:20,037 --> 00:38:24,007
No shade.

1152
00:38:24,374 --> 00:38:27,811
You may look like a beautiful bride.

1153
00:38:27,844 --> 00:38:30,347
But you know deep inside,

1154
00:38:30,347 --> 00:38:33,016
you're not good enough.

1155
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:36,386
You're not good enough.

1156
00:38:36,687 --> 00:38:39,489
Not good enough.

1157
00:38:39,656 --> 00:38:42,592
Not good enough.

1158
00:38:42,626 --> 00:38:45,595
For him.

1159
00:38:45,862 --> 00:38:49,199
For him.

1160
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:50,500
Now,

1161
00:38:50,534 --> 00:38:52,502
sashay

1162
00:38:52,636 --> 00:38:53,971
away...

1163
00:38:54,538 --> 00:38:59,276
And I'll tell you this,

1164
00:38:59,276 --> 00:39:02,946
I'm not sashaying

1165
00:39:03,413 --> 00:39:07,117
I may not be as famous, I may not be as smart.

1166
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:08,986
I don’t know how to cook,

1167
00:39:08,986 --> 00:39:10,821
I don’t know martial arts.

1168
00:39:10,854 --> 00:39:14,057
But I love him.

1169
00:39:14,224 --> 00:39:17,761
I love him.

1170
00:39:19,830 --> 00:39:21,164
Shantay!

1171
00:39:21,431 --> 00:39:22,532
I’ll stay!

1172
00:39:22,632 --> 00:39:24,234
I’ll stay!

1173
00:39:24,468 --> 00:39:30,941
And I'll make you love me!

1174
00:39:32,242 --> 00:39:37,581
Love me!

1175
00:39:48,625 --> 00:39:50,994
Now the queens have pled their case.

1176
00:39:52,829 --> 00:39:55,265
Now the bride's in her rightful place.

1177
00:39:57,034 --> 00:39:58,902
Walking down the aisle,

1178
00:39:58,902 --> 00:40:03,874
with undeniable style, she came to slay.

1179
00:40:04,408 --> 00:40:08,745
Now it's her wedding day!

1180
00:40:09,212 --> 00:40:11,648
So prance, my queen!

1181
00:40:11,681 --> 00:40:13,116
Prance my queen!

1182
00:40:13,116 --> 00:40:16,787
Go and steal the scene.

1183
00:40:17,721 --> 00:40:20,123
So prance, my queen!

1184
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:21,525
Prance my queen!

1185
00:40:21,525 --> 00:40:25,562
Go and live your dreams.

1186
00:40:25,595 --> 00:40:30,467
- Go prance!
- Prancing Queen!

1187
00:40:30,467 --> 00:40:34,071
- Prance it! Prance it! Prance it! Prance it!
- Prance my queen!

1188
00:40:34,104 --> 00:40:40,610
'Cause love wins!

1189
00:40:48,085 --> 00:40:50,187
The wedding is on!

1190
00:40:51,288 --> 00:40:53,223
The wedding is on!

1191
00:40:53,990 --> 00:40:55,459
What a Rusical!

1192
00:40:55,459 --> 00:40:57,561
I can't wait for the sequel.

1193
00:40:57,561 --> 00:40:59,763
Jon M. Chu, call me.

1194
00:41:00,297 --> 00:41:02,432
And now on the Runway, category is

1195
00:41:02,466 --> 00:41:05,102
“Happy Face-tival!”

1196
00:41:05,102 --> 00:41:05,936
First up,

1197
00:41:05,969 --> 00:41:07,938
Brigiding.

1198
00:41:08,004 --> 00:41:09,239
Brigiding?

1199
00:41:09,239 --> 00:41:09,673
Is-

1200
00:41:09,706 --> 00:41:12,476
Is-tatue?

1201
00:41:14,644 --> 00:41:16,279
OH!

1202
00:41:16,513 --> 00:41:18,014
Getting stoned?

1203
00:41:18,014 --> 00:41:21,551
Maybe that guilt's your own.

1204
00:41:21,585 --> 00:41:23,854
Inspired by the iconography of

1205
00:41:23,854 --> 00:41:25,989
churches in the Philippines.

1206
00:41:26,123 --> 00:41:27,591
I prayed for this.

1207
00:41:27,624 --> 00:41:29,593
Gagged? You should be.

1208
00:41:29,926 --> 00:41:31,361
Saint Brigiding,

1209
00:41:31,394 --> 00:41:34,097
slay for us.

1210
00:41:34,564 --> 00:41:36,066
Kitty Space.

1211
00:41:36,133 --> 00:41:37,134
My outfit

1212
00:41:37,134 --> 00:41:39,302
is inspired by the forest creature

1213
00:41:39,336 --> 00:41:40,337
in France.

1214
00:41:40,370 --> 00:41:41,738
It's under the snow.

1215
00:41:41,738 --> 00:41:44,241
So I wanted to create something really poetic.

1216
00:41:44,274 --> 00:41:47,077
It also represents my childhood.

1217
00:41:47,110 --> 00:41:49,279
With my brother and my sister,

1218
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:51,848
We used to go to the forest and play,

1219
00:41:52,048 --> 00:41:52,883
with the snow.

1220
00:41:52,883 --> 00:41:56,019
So that was kind of a family moment.

1221
00:41:56,386 --> 00:41:57,988
She's an ethereal girl

1222
00:41:57,988 --> 00:42:00,590
in an ethereal world!

1223
00:42:02,893 --> 00:42:04,127
Bernie.

1224
00:42:06,029 --> 00:42:07,797
My Runway look

1225
00:42:07,831 --> 00:42:09,466
is a three-headed devil.

1226
00:42:09,499 --> 00:42:11,234
You may think you know Diday,

1227
00:42:11,268 --> 00:42:13,403
but I have two more faces.

1228
00:42:16,006 --> 00:42:18,141
The devil wears nada!

1229
00:42:20,110 --> 00:42:22,179
Heaven and earth, in—

1230
00:42:22,212 --> 00:42:23,246
fairness.

1231
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:24,181
In,

1232
00:42:24,214 --> 00:42:27,284
in, in fairness.

1233
00:42:32,656 --> 00:42:34,357
Arizona Brandy.

1234
00:42:34,724 --> 00:42:36,059
For this Runway,

1235
00:42:36,126 --> 00:42:38,528
it's an embodiment of how I feel

1236
00:42:38,528 --> 00:42:40,063
when I'm anxious,

1237
00:42:40,130 --> 00:42:42,399
how I feel when I'm depressed.

1238
00:42:42,432 --> 00:42:43,500
The other one,

1239
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:44,501
is when sometimes I feel like

1240
00:42:44,534 --> 00:42:45,869
I'm judging myself.

1241
00:42:45,869 --> 00:42:47,470
The other one's sad,

1242
00:42:47,504 --> 00:42:48,872
but at the end of the day,

1243
00:42:48,905 --> 00:42:50,674
I still try to smile.

1244
00:42:51,107 --> 00:42:53,076
Face to face to face!

1245
00:42:54,010 --> 00:42:55,045
The face card

1246
00:42:55,045 --> 00:42:56,780
always declines.

1247
00:42:56,813 --> 00:42:58,415
Aww!

1248
00:43:04,354 --> 00:43:05,855
Khianna.

1249
00:43:06,756 --> 00:43:07,991
So for this Runway,

1250
00:43:08,024 --> 00:43:09,559
I am heavily inspired

1251
00:43:09,559 --> 00:43:11,228
by The Substance.

1252
00:43:11,261 --> 00:43:13,029
And I feel very...

1253
00:43:16,533 --> 00:43:17,934
The new me

1254
00:43:18,001 --> 00:43:19,803
is about to come.

1255
00:43:21,371 --> 00:43:23,006
That's how you do it!

1256
00:43:23,073 --> 00:43:25,542
Respect the balance!

1257
00:43:27,911 --> 00:43:29,412
BMW.

1258
00:43:29,813 --> 00:43:32,115
Body Made Wong.

1259
00:43:33,850 --> 00:43:34,851
Yuhua.

1260
00:43:35,785 --> 00:43:36,519
For this Runway,

1261
00:43:36,553 --> 00:43:38,822
I'm trying to give a little bit something different

1262
00:43:38,955 --> 00:43:40,590
So I went a different route.

1263
00:43:40,590 --> 00:43:42,659
I am inspired by The Substance, baby.

1264
00:43:42,692 --> 00:43:44,160
With Demi Moore.

1265
00:43:45,362 --> 00:43:46,763
Face, face, face,

1266
00:43:46,763 --> 00:43:47,864
face, face.

1267
00:43:47,931 --> 00:43:49,733
Beauty face.

1268
00:43:52,335 --> 00:43:54,137
The Substance—

1269
00:43:54,137 --> 00:43:56,740
abuse.

1270
00:43:57,374 --> 00:43:58,775
It's Demi

1271
00:43:58,875 --> 00:44:00,710
Moore faces.

1272
00:44:02,679 --> 00:44:04,114
Siam Phusri.

1273
00:44:04,514 --> 00:44:06,283
Every time I have doubts in my life,

1274
00:44:06,316 --> 00:44:08,752
I always go to Phra Phum.

1275
00:44:08,785 --> 00:44:11,288
And ask the spirits to help me.

1276
00:44:11,321 --> 00:44:12,088
And guide me

1277
00:44:12,155 --> 00:44:14,491
through everything that I would love to see.

1278
00:44:14,624 --> 00:44:15,759
My hairstylist,

1279
00:44:15,792 --> 00:44:17,027
my massage therapist,

1280
00:44:17,027 --> 00:44:18,328
everyone's an artist.

1281
00:44:18,361 --> 00:44:19,429
So I put it right there.

1282
00:44:19,663 --> 00:44:21,331
I'm not just showing my face,

1283
00:44:21,431 --> 00:44:22,699
but I'm showing

1284
00:44:22,732 --> 00:44:24,134
my life story.

1285
00:44:24,601 --> 00:44:26,403
Mother Buddha!

1286
00:44:33,109 --> 00:44:34,778
Suki Doll.

1287
00:44:35,712 --> 00:44:36,680
For this Runway,

1288
00:44:36,713 --> 00:44:37,947
I am your

1289
00:44:37,981 --> 00:44:39,416
Japanese inspiration.

1290
00:44:39,449 --> 00:44:40,817
We do have a multi-face

1291
00:44:40,850 --> 00:44:42,986
and I am giving you all the expressions that

1292
00:44:42,986 --> 00:44:44,721
I would do.

1293
00:44:44,754 --> 00:44:46,690
The thigh-high Geta,

1294
00:44:46,723 --> 00:44:48,158
that is killing my feet,

1295
00:44:48,191 --> 00:44:49,426
but it's giving you

1296
00:44:49,459 --> 00:44:51,895
this amazing traditional look.

1297
00:44:51,995 --> 00:44:54,397
Yas-queen kudasai!

1298
00:44:54,998 --> 00:44:56,132
Arigatou gozai-

1299
00:44:56,132 --> 00:44:57,500
mask.

1300
00:45:00,537 --> 00:45:02,205
Viñas DeLuxe.

1301
00:45:07,677 --> 00:45:09,713
This Runway is actually very

1302
00:45:09,746 --> 00:45:10,980
important to me.

1303
00:45:11,014 --> 00:45:13,883
As a child, I wanted to try painting, but,

1304
00:45:13,917 --> 00:45:15,785
we didn't have a budget.

1305
00:45:15,819 --> 00:45:16,686
And now,

1306
00:45:16,686 --> 00:45:17,787
I didn't just try it,

1307
00:45:17,787 --> 00:45:19,055
I'm also wearing it

1308
00:45:19,055 --> 00:45:22,525
on the biggest stage for a drag queen.

1309
00:45:22,525 --> 00:45:26,029
It's the Missus Multiverse.

1310
00:45:27,864 --> 00:45:29,632
Welcome back, ladies.

1311
00:45:29,699 --> 00:45:31,801
You all deserve every Tony in the world,

1312
00:45:31,801 --> 00:45:33,737
for that Rusical.

1313
00:45:33,737 --> 00:45:35,171
Yay!

1314
00:45:35,438 --> 00:45:37,006
Very good, ladies.

1315
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:38,908
You've also slapped us all

1316
00:45:38,908 --> 00:45:40,110
in the face with those

1317
00:45:40,110 --> 00:45:42,312
“Face-tival” Runway looks.

1318
00:45:42,345 --> 00:45:43,380
And now,

1319
00:45:43,413 --> 00:45:44,647
we're face to face

1320
00:45:44,681 --> 00:45:47,917
as we face our fiercest fears.

1321
00:45:47,951 --> 00:45:49,619
- Wow, tongue twister.
- But, take your

1322
00:45:49,652 --> 00:45:52,489
place in this space at your own pace...

1323
00:45:52,522 --> 00:45:53,390
because,

1324
00:45:53,390 --> 00:45:55,925
it's all just a phase.

1325
00:45:55,959 --> 00:45:57,660
Let's mani-face, and

1326
00:45:57,660 --> 00:46:00,230
face be with you!

1327
00:46:00,663 --> 00:46:02,632
Now, when I call your name

1328
00:46:02,632 --> 00:46:04,701
please face the wall.

1329
00:46:04,701 --> 00:46:07,504
No, please step forward.

1330
00:46:07,504 --> 00:46:08,838
Okay, Queens?

1331
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:11,741
Brigiding.

1332
00:46:14,544 --> 00:46:16,346
Kitty Space.

1333
00:46:18,882 --> 00:46:20,216
Bernie.

1334
00:46:21,718 --> 00:46:23,720
Arizona Brandy.

1335
00:46:25,688 --> 00:46:27,290
Siam Phusri.

1336
00:46:29,526 --> 00:46:31,761
Viñas DeLuxe.

1337
00:46:34,230 --> 00:46:35,598
Queens, you are the Tops

1338
00:46:35,632 --> 00:46:37,767
and Bottoms of the week.

1339
00:46:41,137 --> 00:46:43,006
The rest of you are safe.

1340
00:46:43,673 --> 00:46:45,708
Thank you, Mama Pao.

1341
00:46:46,075 --> 00:46:48,678
Please head back to the Werkroom and untuck.

1342
00:46:48,711 --> 00:46:50,747
And face the wall. Yes.

1343
00:46:56,319 --> 00:46:59,055
Now, for the judges' critiques.

1344
00:46:59,122 --> 00:47:00,089
First of all,

1345
00:47:00,123 --> 00:47:01,257
I just want to say

1346
00:47:01,257 --> 00:47:03,193
that the Slaysian Queens,

1347
00:47:03,226 --> 00:47:05,228
are slaying!

1348
00:47:05,261 --> 00:47:07,263
Yay!

1349
00:47:08,431 --> 00:47:10,433
And this is one of the best

1350
00:47:10,467 --> 00:47:14,003
Runway presentations I've ever seen

1351
00:47:14,003 --> 00:47:17,774
in my judging career in Drag Race Philippines.

1352
00:47:17,807 --> 00:47:20,577
Congratulations to all of you.

1353
00:47:20,677 --> 00:47:22,145
My goodness.

1354
00:47:22,178 --> 00:47:23,980
Now, let's start with

1355
00:47:24,013 --> 00:47:25,081
Brigiding.

1356
00:47:25,448 --> 00:47:28,618
When it came to your Runway today,

1357
00:47:28,885 --> 00:47:30,453
bitch, I'm floored.

1358
00:47:30,487 --> 00:47:31,654
Because that look,

1359
00:47:31,688 --> 00:47:34,023
I wasn't sure which was the real face.

1360
00:47:34,057 --> 00:47:35,992
I know you have two faces,

1361
00:47:36,025 --> 00:47:38,661
but both of them were

1362
00:47:38,695 --> 00:47:40,730
so confusingly great.

1363
00:47:40,763 --> 00:47:41,965
And you sold it,

1364
00:47:41,998 --> 00:47:44,300
and it's such a memorable look, that

1365
00:47:44,334 --> 00:47:45,702
I'm stoned!

1366
00:47:47,070 --> 00:47:49,205
Brigs, you slayed

1367
00:47:49,205 --> 00:47:50,507
the Rusical.

1368
00:47:50,507 --> 00:47:53,977
It's always very refreshing to see you on stage

1369
00:47:53,977 --> 00:47:56,946
giving that 100% energy.

1370
00:47:56,946 --> 00:47:59,749
The characterization was on point.

1371
00:47:59,749 --> 00:48:02,385
I really felt that you were the bride

1372
00:48:02,385 --> 00:48:04,554
fighting for the love of your life.

1373
00:48:04,587 --> 00:48:07,524
You are such a great drag artist.

1374
00:48:07,524 --> 00:48:09,459
- Thank you.
- Congratulations, Brigs.

1375
00:48:09,492 --> 00:48:10,927
This is your moment!

1376
00:48:10,927 --> 00:48:13,730
Brigiding, you were so great in your Rusical.

1377
00:48:13,730 --> 00:48:17,133
You really looked like a Hollywood Star.

1378
00:48:17,333 --> 00:48:18,468
Thank you so much, Mama Pao,

1379
00:48:18,468 --> 00:48:20,069
Pangina, and KaladKaren.

1380
00:48:20,103 --> 00:48:21,704
I've always wanted to make you proud,

1381
00:48:21,704 --> 00:48:23,806
and to hear these words from you.

1382
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:24,641
I really look up to you.

1383
00:48:24,641 --> 00:48:26,843
Thank you so much for your words today.

1384
00:48:27,944 --> 00:48:29,279
Kitty Space.

1385
00:48:29,279 --> 00:48:31,781
- Hi, Mama Pao.
- Hi, Kitty Space.

1386
00:48:31,948 --> 00:48:34,150
My God, as Lin-Tek Lee,

1387
00:48:34,150 --> 00:48:36,753
the tech mogul,

1388
00:48:36,819 --> 00:48:38,721
my God, you were so funny.

1389
00:48:38,755 --> 00:48:40,924
However,

1390
00:48:41,024 --> 00:48:44,227
I think there was a problem with your lip sync.

1391
00:48:44,561 --> 00:48:46,029
In order to command

1392
00:48:46,029 --> 00:48:47,163
a character,

1393
00:48:47,196 --> 00:48:49,098
and to make people believe you are

1394
00:48:49,098 --> 00:48:50,667
that actual character,

1395
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:53,469
your lip syncing has to be so sharp.

1396
00:48:53,770 --> 00:48:55,338
And for me, you were not sharp.

1397
00:48:55,471 --> 00:48:57,240
Well with this look, though,

1398
00:48:57,273 --> 00:49:00,043
I know you're a fashion queen,

1399
00:49:00,243 --> 00:49:01,811
and we love your fashion, but

1400
00:49:01,811 --> 00:49:04,747
I think I kind of saw that already

1401
00:49:04,781 --> 00:49:06,082
in your previous Runways, you know?

1402
00:49:06,115 --> 00:49:07,350
The fur, and

1403
00:49:07,417 --> 00:49:08,885
the silhouette, you know?

1404
00:49:08,918 --> 00:49:10,887
Some more variety, I guess.

1405
00:49:11,054 --> 00:49:12,789
Thank you, Kitty Space.

1406
00:49:12,789 --> 00:49:13,756
Thank you very much.

1407
00:49:13,790 --> 00:49:15,258
Next.

1408
00:49:15,758 --> 00:49:17,093
Bernie.

1409
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:19,495
Your character in the Rusical

1410
00:49:19,495 --> 00:49:21,130
for me, fell flat.

1411
00:49:22,165 --> 00:49:23,666
The character could have been more

1412
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:26,469
ditzy, more fun, and much bigger.

1413
00:49:26,536 --> 00:49:27,670
And I felt like,

1414
00:49:27,670 --> 00:49:28,771
for me,

1415
00:49:28,771 --> 00:49:31,441
it just did not go anywhere.

1416
00:49:31,908 --> 00:49:32,976
And I know

1417
00:49:33,042 --> 00:49:35,278
what kind of a performer you are.

1418
00:49:35,445 --> 00:49:38,014
In the drag world, you are a Titan.

1419
00:49:38,114 --> 00:49:40,183
That did not come through today,

1420
00:49:40,216 --> 00:49:41,951
unfortunately, for me.

1421
00:49:41,985 --> 00:49:43,586
I think it's too you.

1422
00:49:43,586 --> 00:49:44,554
It's too Bernie.

1423
00:49:44,554 --> 00:49:46,055
And it's not a character.

1424
00:49:46,055 --> 00:49:48,925
So I guess what we're trying to say here is that

1425
00:49:48,958 --> 00:49:49,425
make it

1426
00:49:49,425 --> 00:49:50,994
totally different from you.

1427
00:49:51,127 --> 00:49:52,695
Because we all know who you are

1428
00:49:52,695 --> 00:49:54,464
and how you are as a performer.

1429
00:49:54,564 --> 00:49:57,300
When it comes to your look today as well,

1430
00:49:57,333 --> 00:49:58,868
I felt like, for me,

1431
00:49:58,868 --> 00:50:01,838
the faces does not really resemble yours.

1432
00:50:01,938 --> 00:50:04,540
And you know, with the bodysuit

1433
00:50:04,674 --> 00:50:06,075
and the stripper heels,

1434
00:50:06,109 --> 00:50:07,710
I felt like,

1435
00:50:07,777 --> 00:50:10,380
I know that you're more capable than this.

1436
00:50:11,014 --> 00:50:11,614
So...

1437
00:50:11,648 --> 00:50:12,949
Know that I love you,

1438
00:50:12,949 --> 00:50:14,951
but I am an honest bitch,

1439
00:50:15,051 --> 00:50:16,319
and I will say

1440
00:50:16,319 --> 00:50:17,286
what I think.

1441
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:18,521
And I love you.

1442
00:50:18,921 --> 00:50:20,590
- Thank you.
- Thank you very much.

1443
00:50:20,923 --> 00:50:22,225
Next up.

1444
00:50:22,291 --> 00:50:24,327
Arizona Brandy.

1445
00:50:24,594 --> 00:50:26,529
This look is fashion forward.

1446
00:50:26,529 --> 00:50:28,297
I love it, I love the

1447
00:50:28,331 --> 00:50:30,967
play of black fabric,

1448
00:50:31,034 --> 00:50:32,902
and how you made it like

1449
00:50:32,935 --> 00:50:34,037
hair or web.

1450
00:50:34,070 --> 00:50:36,873
- I swear it's creepy.
- Yes, it's creepy.

1451
00:50:36,906 --> 00:50:38,341
- It's creepy good.
- It looks exactly like you.

1452
00:50:38,374 --> 00:50:40,543
- Creepy good.
- The face is looking at Bernie.

1453
00:50:40,576 --> 00:50:41,878
It's like saying, "Really, bitch?"

1454
00:50:41,878 --> 00:50:43,046
I know!

1455
00:50:43,479 --> 00:50:45,314
Your performance,

1456
00:50:45,381 --> 00:50:47,817
5, 6, 7,

1457
00:50:47,984 --> 00:50:49,052
ATE.

1458
00:50:49,085 --> 00:50:50,753
- You ate.
- Thank you!

1459
00:50:50,787 --> 00:50:53,256
From the minute you walked onto that stage

1460
00:50:53,322 --> 00:50:54,624
with every single person

1461
00:50:54,624 --> 00:50:56,259
in the room, and all the craziness,

1462
00:50:56,259 --> 00:50:58,161
I was looking at you.

1463
00:50:58,528 --> 00:51:01,597
Your lip-syncing skill is so high because

1464
00:51:01,964 --> 00:51:03,466
I was convinced.

1465
00:51:03,466 --> 00:51:05,068
Your eye contact,

1466
00:51:05,134 --> 00:51:06,469
your movement,

1467
00:51:06,536 --> 00:51:07,904
your wording,

1468
00:51:07,937 --> 00:51:09,305
your conviction,

1469
00:51:09,405 --> 00:51:10,573
every single thing,

1470
00:51:10,606 --> 00:51:12,108
I could not clock.

1471
00:51:12,408 --> 00:51:13,076
It was

1472
00:51:13,109 --> 00:51:16,045
near perfection when it came to your performance.

1473
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:18,047
Like, I was so floored.

1474
00:51:18,081 --> 00:51:19,649
I was so entertained.

1475
00:51:19,682 --> 00:51:21,751
I was laughing the whole time.

1476
00:51:22,351 --> 00:51:24,754
And you're scary as a drag queen, girl.

1477
00:51:24,821 --> 00:51:26,355
Thank you, Arizona Brandy.

1478
00:51:26,389 --> 00:51:27,423
Next up.

1479
00:51:27,623 --> 00:51:29,992
Siam Phusri.

1480
00:51:30,026 --> 00:51:31,360
It's always fun

1481
00:51:31,394 --> 00:51:33,262
to see you performing on stage,

1482
00:51:33,296 --> 00:51:34,430
Siam.

1483
00:51:34,464 --> 00:51:36,899
You have this infectious energy

1484
00:51:36,899 --> 00:51:38,534
that gets me.

1485
00:51:39,102 --> 00:51:41,571
When it comes to you presenting your Runway,

1486
00:51:41,637 --> 00:51:43,306
when you first walked out, I was like,

1487
00:51:43,306 --> 00:51:45,341
"Oh, my God, this is beautiful."

1488
00:51:45,441 --> 00:51:46,676
And then

1489
00:51:46,709 --> 00:51:49,178
the shrine almost fell off your head.

1490
00:51:49,245 --> 00:51:51,114
Us, as drag queens,

1491
00:51:51,147 --> 00:51:52,248
we have to practice with

1492
00:51:52,281 --> 00:51:54,150
every single thing

1493
00:51:54,183 --> 00:51:56,018
when we're on that stage.

1494
00:51:56,052 --> 00:51:57,887
It becomes a part of your body.

1495
00:51:57,920 --> 00:51:59,188
Do your homework more

1496
00:51:59,188 --> 00:52:00,656
and I think you will excel.

1497
00:52:00,923 --> 00:52:01,758
Thank you.

1498
00:52:02,391 --> 00:52:04,293
Thank you, Siam Phusri.

1499
00:52:04,627 --> 00:52:05,862
Viñas DeLuxe.

1500
00:52:06,362 --> 00:52:08,931
My God, Viñas, you are

1501
00:52:09,031 --> 00:52:10,900
and you have always been,

1502
00:52:10,933 --> 00:52:12,769
an intelligent

1503
00:52:12,835 --> 00:52:13,870
performer.

1504
00:52:14,003 --> 00:52:15,571
You know how to attack

1505
00:52:15,571 --> 00:52:18,241
each segment of the story.

1506
00:52:18,274 --> 00:52:20,376
So that is really, very important.

1507
00:52:20,676 --> 00:52:22,345
Your look

1508
00:52:22,545 --> 00:52:25,248
was kind of underwhelming for me,

1509
00:52:25,782 --> 00:52:26,983
just because

1510
00:52:27,049 --> 00:52:30,052
I saw you last week and you blew me away.

1511
00:52:30,153 --> 00:52:32,088
With the look that you made yourself.

1512
00:52:32,188 --> 00:52:36,793
I felt like today, it relied so heavily on the reveal.

1513
00:52:36,859 --> 00:52:38,227
And like the look itself,

1514
00:52:38,261 --> 00:52:40,096
needs to stand alone,

1515
00:52:40,129 --> 00:52:41,397
without the reveal.

1516
00:52:41,430 --> 00:52:43,800
And I don't know if it can.

1517
00:52:44,233 --> 00:52:46,402
And I'm being nitpicky, but that's

1518
00:52:46,469 --> 00:52:48,204
how I'm gonna be with you all.

1519
00:52:48,337 --> 00:52:51,507
Because this is not just a regular season.

1520
00:52:51,507 --> 00:52:54,477
This is a Slaysian Royale.

1521
00:52:55,178 --> 00:52:56,379
Thank you, ladies.

1522
00:52:56,412 --> 00:52:58,714
I think I've heard enough.

1523
00:52:58,781 --> 00:53:00,616
Now based on your Rusical performances

1524
00:53:00,650 --> 00:53:02,351
and your Runway looks,

1525
00:53:02,385 --> 00:53:04,887
we have made some decisions.

1526
00:53:08,357 --> 00:53:09,325
Brigiding.

1527
00:53:13,329 --> 00:53:14,630
Arizona Brandy.

1528
00:53:17,233 --> 00:53:18,734
Condragratulations,

1529
00:53:18,734 --> 00:53:21,070
you are the Top 2 Slaysians

1530
00:53:21,070 --> 00:53:22,238
of the week.

1531
00:53:22,305 --> 00:53:25,208
- Thank you.
- Yay!

1532
00:53:27,977 --> 00:53:29,579
Viñas DeLuxe.

1533
00:53:31,414 --> 00:53:32,648
You are safe.

1534
00:53:35,384 --> 00:53:36,152
Thank you.

1535
00:53:36,185 --> 00:53:38,521
Siam Phusri.

1536
00:53:40,690 --> 00:53:42,425
You are also safe.

1537
00:53:44,093 --> 00:53:45,595
That means,

1538
00:53:45,695 --> 00:53:46,562
Bernie,

1539
00:53:46,562 --> 00:53:48,497
and Kitty Space,

1540
00:53:48,564 --> 00:53:51,934
You are the Bottom 2 queens of the week.

1541
00:53:53,069 --> 00:53:55,438
Brigiding, Arizona Brandy,

1542
00:53:55,438 --> 00:53:57,340
each of you needs to decide

1543
00:53:57,373 --> 00:53:58,941
which of the bottom queens

1544
00:53:58,975 --> 00:54:00,409
you will eliminate

1545
00:54:00,443 --> 00:54:02,411
if you win the lip sync.

1546
00:54:03,212 --> 00:54:05,248
Now while you Queens

1547
00:54:05,281 --> 00:54:07,950
deliberate and untuck in the Werkroom,

1548
00:54:08,084 --> 00:54:09,452
the judges and I,

1549
00:54:09,485 --> 00:54:12,088
will winnow the rice.

1550
00:54:12,121 --> 00:54:14,090
Winnow?!

1551
00:54:14,624 --> 00:54:15,791
Please proceed to the Werkroom,

1552
00:54:15,791 --> 00:54:17,159
and evaporate.

1553
00:54:29,138 --> 00:54:30,006
Oh, it's so big!

1554
00:54:30,273 --> 00:54:31,874
Hi!

1555
00:54:31,874 --> 00:54:34,110
- Hello!
- Oh, my God.

1556
00:54:34,176 --> 00:54:35,845
What's up, ladies?

1557
00:54:36,178 --> 00:54:38,381
We don't know which face to look at.

1558
00:54:40,082 --> 00:54:43,085
So, what did the judges say?

1559
00:54:43,286 --> 00:54:44,387
I'm at the top!

1560
00:54:44,387 --> 00:54:45,221
Yay!

1561
00:54:45,221 --> 00:54:46,322
Bitch, we knew!

1562
00:54:46,322 --> 00:54:48,124
Bitch, what did I tell you?

1563
00:54:48,124 --> 00:54:49,725
- First time at the top.
- We all saw how hard you worked.

1564
00:54:49,725 --> 00:54:51,527
- You should be so proud.
- Thank you!

1565
00:54:51,527 --> 00:54:53,529
I'm very, very grateful for this

1566
00:54:53,596 --> 00:54:55,431
chance to be at the top.

1567
00:54:55,731 --> 00:54:56,933
I am very happy

1568
00:54:57,033 --> 00:54:59,068
That I took the risk

1569
00:54:59,135 --> 00:55:00,903
to get one of the biggest roles.

1570
00:55:00,970 --> 00:55:02,872
I'm on the top, too.

1571
00:55:04,140 --> 00:55:07,043
It feels nice to be back on the top.

1572
00:55:08,577 --> 00:55:11,113
I felt like I vindicated myself

1573
00:55:11,113 --> 00:55:12,281
for that trip

1574
00:55:13,449 --> 00:55:15,785
that I did last week.

1575
00:55:15,952 --> 00:55:18,187
The judges really loved it.

1576
00:55:18,454 --> 00:55:20,356
They were really entertained.

1577
00:55:20,356 --> 00:55:22,825
So it's given me the

1578
00:55:22,825 --> 00:55:24,026
affirmation,

1579
00:55:24,026 --> 00:55:25,594
that I needed that

1580
00:55:25,594 --> 00:55:27,596
I'm a great performer.

1581
00:55:28,164 --> 00:55:30,466
Let's just reveal the Bottoms, sis.

1582
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:32,802
- Bernie.
- I'm the Bottom.

1583
00:55:33,235 --> 00:55:34,804
The two trans are in the bottom.

1584
00:55:35,671 --> 00:55:36,639
You are in the bottom?

1585
00:55:36,639 --> 00:55:37,540
Yes.

1586
00:55:37,573 --> 00:55:39,141
Kitty, how do you feel?

1587
00:55:39,141 --> 00:55:40,076
I'm okay.

1588
00:55:40,076 --> 00:55:42,311
Honestly, it's weird because

1589
00:55:42,345 --> 00:55:44,280
I'm proud of what I did today.

1590
00:55:44,580 --> 00:55:45,982
Because...

1591
00:55:50,019 --> 00:55:53,189
My hope now is, I hope Mama Pao will save me.

1592
00:55:53,189 --> 00:55:56,625
Because I know they want to save a Filipina girl

1593
00:55:56,625 --> 00:56:00,329
and Arizona will have her revenge.

1594
00:56:01,364 --> 00:56:03,899
I feel so guilty.

1595
00:56:03,899 --> 00:56:06,635
In a sense that it’s not my fault

1596
00:56:06,635 --> 00:56:09,839
that Kitty’s in the bottom but I was thinking

1597
00:56:09,839 --> 00:56:13,009
it should’ve been the role that I have.

1598
00:56:15,244 --> 00:56:18,180
Because for the first time in my life,

1599
00:56:18,214 --> 00:56:20,182
in Drag Race,

1600
00:56:20,182 --> 00:56:22,184
I enjoyed it.

1601
00:56:22,251 --> 00:56:23,586
I don't think I did bad.

1602
00:56:23,586 --> 00:56:26,522
I was funny, I was confident.

1603
00:56:26,555 --> 00:56:28,290
So...

1604
00:56:29,091 --> 00:56:32,194
And today I really realized why I do drag.

1605
00:56:32,261 --> 00:56:33,896
Because it's my passion.

1606
00:56:34,363 --> 00:56:37,466
And because drag really saved my life.

1607
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:40,202
I want to stay for sure.

1608
00:56:40,202 --> 00:56:42,104
Because I have so much more

1609
00:56:42,171 --> 00:56:43,572
to prove, to show.

1610
00:56:44,106 --> 00:56:46,108
- What about you, sis?
- My sister,

1611
00:56:46,175 --> 00:56:48,344
- How do you feel?
- with an angry face.

1612
00:56:49,345 --> 00:56:51,414
There you go, right? I said I wanted critiques.

1613
00:56:51,447 --> 00:56:53,883
Well, I got critiqued alright and ended up in the bottom.

1614
00:56:55,251 --> 00:56:57,686
Fuck you! This bitch.

1615
00:56:57,753 --> 00:56:59,789
You need to accept it, Diday. You need to accept it.

1616
00:56:59,789 --> 00:57:01,690
Don't lose your cool, hold it in.

1617
00:57:01,690 --> 00:57:03,025
I told myself to hold it in.

1618
00:57:03,025 --> 00:57:04,693
“There was nothing wrong with what you did.”

1619
00:57:05,394 --> 00:57:06,829
Sorry for this.

1620
00:57:08,597 --> 00:57:11,467
Actually this is my first time to be at the Bottom and...

1621
00:57:11,667 --> 00:57:15,771
I know that there's still so much that I can show here.

1622
00:57:17,239 --> 00:57:18,607
I can still fight.

1623
00:57:19,975 --> 00:57:21,043
I still have it.

1624
00:57:21,043 --> 00:57:23,112
I can do this.

1625
00:57:25,648 --> 00:57:27,550
It's not yet my time to go.

1626
00:57:28,250 --> 00:57:30,586
I'm embarrassed for myself because

1627
00:57:30,719 --> 00:57:33,522
I was the second Filipina that was in the bottom.

1628
00:57:34,824 --> 00:57:36,592
I want to ask the girls.

1629
00:57:36,659 --> 00:57:39,395
How are we trying to play the game?

1630
00:57:39,428 --> 00:57:41,430
Are we trying to

1631
00:57:43,032 --> 00:57:45,734
do it based on track record?

1632
00:57:45,734 --> 00:57:47,603
Or are we basing it on friendship

1633
00:57:47,603 --> 00:57:50,539
or relationship or who we get along with?

1634
00:57:50,706 --> 00:57:54,543
For me, I really wanna weigh in everything.

1635
00:57:54,543 --> 00:57:56,679
To be honest, like I know Bernie.

1636
00:57:56,679 --> 00:57:58,681
We've been on the same season.

1637
00:57:58,747 --> 00:58:01,617
We've had shows together after.

1638
00:58:02,284 --> 00:58:03,786
I want to look at the person

1639
00:58:03,819 --> 00:58:06,755
and see like the fire, you know.

1640
00:58:06,956 --> 00:58:08,023
There's no rules.

1641
00:58:08,023 --> 00:58:10,626
We can send our competition home, that's fine.

1642
00:58:10,626 --> 00:58:11,994
I would understand Arizona

1643
00:58:11,994 --> 00:58:13,863
if she decides to pick Kitty.

1644
00:58:13,863 --> 00:58:15,397
Because,

1645
00:58:15,464 --> 00:58:18,634
Kitty voted for her when she was at the bottom.

1646
00:58:18,701 --> 00:58:21,403
But if we were to base it on track record,

1647
00:58:21,403 --> 00:58:24,206
Bernie should be the one to sashay.

1648
00:58:25,307 --> 00:58:25,841
Okay.

1649
00:58:25,875 --> 00:58:27,109
Okay.

1650
00:58:27,143 --> 00:58:28,277
Why do you want to stay?

1651
00:58:28,310 --> 00:58:29,211
Drag is my life.

1652
00:58:29,211 --> 00:58:31,413
Drag really saved my life.

1653
00:58:31,747 --> 00:58:34,517
Like as a fashion designer, as an artist,

1654
00:58:34,550 --> 00:58:36,452
as a trans girl,

1655
00:58:36,485 --> 00:58:38,254
as...

1656
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:39,455
- as me.
- Yeah.

1657
00:58:39,989 --> 00:58:42,024
She's kind of convincing me.

1658
00:58:42,091 --> 00:58:44,727
I want to save her

1659
00:58:44,793 --> 00:58:47,830
because I see the fire and the passion.

1660
00:58:48,330 --> 00:58:49,765
I know what you're going to do

1661
00:58:49,765 --> 00:58:52,368
because I took your lipstick, I know.

1662
00:58:52,401 --> 00:58:54,270
But in any case, I'm proud.

1663
00:58:54,570 --> 00:58:55,704
I'm proud of you.

1664
00:58:55,738 --> 00:58:56,872
Thank you, me too.

1665
00:58:56,939 --> 00:58:59,241
If you want to be based on track record,

1666
00:58:59,241 --> 00:59:00,776
I think I shouldn't go home

1667
00:59:00,809 --> 00:59:04,146
because my track record is better.

1668
00:59:04,146 --> 00:59:06,315
Like I was safe, safe, top.

1669
00:59:06,315 --> 00:59:07,683
When I said I wanted critiques,

1670
00:59:07,683 --> 00:59:09,685
I didn't mean for it to be bottom critiques.

1671
00:59:09,685 --> 00:59:12,454
I know I can do more and show more.

1672
00:59:12,488 --> 00:59:14,023
You know, you are my sister

1673
00:59:14,023 --> 00:59:16,091
and I've known you for a long time.

1674
00:59:16,125 --> 00:59:17,960
And I know you can do so much.

1675
00:59:17,993 --> 00:59:19,028
I believe in you.

1676
00:59:19,028 --> 00:59:20,362
You know that, Bernie.

1677
00:59:20,362 --> 00:59:22,064
If they will be Top 4,

1678
00:59:22,131 --> 00:59:23,832
who do you see in the Top 4?

1679
00:59:24,233 --> 00:59:26,168
Viñas, you,

1680
00:59:26,235 --> 00:59:27,736
me,

1681
00:59:27,903 --> 00:59:29,238
and Ari.

1682
00:59:29,338 --> 00:59:30,072
Okay.

1683
00:59:30,339 --> 00:59:32,575
Thank you Bernie, love you.

1684
00:59:33,108 --> 00:59:35,344
Why do you want to stay?

1685
00:59:35,377 --> 00:59:37,179
This was my first mistake.

1686
00:59:37,179 --> 00:59:38,380
Yes, I was safe.

1687
00:59:38,380 --> 00:59:40,749
But I've never been in the bottom.

1688
00:59:41,050 --> 00:59:44,520
If ever I don't pick your lipstick,

1689
00:59:44,887 --> 00:59:47,089
what if you still have a chance?

1690
00:59:47,089 --> 00:59:48,891
Can you promise me that

1691
00:59:48,924 --> 00:59:50,392
this will be the last time you're in the bottom?

1692
00:59:50,426 --> 00:59:51,760
Yes, this is the last time.

1693
00:59:51,794 --> 00:59:53,395
As in, legit.

1694
00:59:53,429 --> 00:59:55,397
This will be the last time that I'm in the bottom.

1695
00:59:55,397 --> 00:59:56,999
Fuck this!

1696
00:59:57,066 --> 00:59:58,968
I don't want to beg you or anything.

1697
00:59:58,968 --> 01:00:01,370
It's up to you to choose the queen

1698
01:00:01,370 --> 01:00:04,773
you feel deserves to stay here,

1699
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:06,141
go.

1700
01:00:06,208 --> 01:00:07,042
How are you? How do you feel?

1701
01:00:07,076 --> 01:00:07,810
- I'm fine.
- I'm so proud of you—

1702
01:00:07,810 --> 01:00:09,378
I feel proud and I am—

1703
01:00:09,378 --> 01:00:10,879
for everything that you did

1704
01:00:10,879 --> 01:00:11,947
- I feel sad.
- on this show.

1705
01:00:11,947 --> 01:00:12,815
I feel sad about leaving

1706
01:00:12,815 --> 01:00:14,383
because you know how

1707
01:00:17,152 --> 01:00:18,954
how I worked every day,

1708
01:00:18,988 --> 01:00:20,756
every night to be there.

1709
01:00:20,756 --> 01:00:22,458
I just want to stay to...

1710
01:00:22,458 --> 01:00:24,827
to show to the world that

1711
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:27,496
I'm that girl. I'm worth it, you know.

1712
01:00:27,730 --> 01:00:28,831
I love you so much.

1713
01:00:28,897 --> 01:00:29,832
Yeah, same.

1714
01:00:29,932 --> 01:00:30,933
I love you.

1715
01:00:32,801 --> 01:00:35,170
As I was walking towards the lipstick,

1716
01:00:35,170 --> 01:00:36,739
I was thinking of,

1717
01:00:36,805 --> 01:00:40,209
you know, what dinner I will have after this.

1718
01:00:40,242 --> 01:00:43,112
I'm craving for steamed pork buns,

1719
01:00:44,113 --> 01:00:46,949
Chicken Kung Pao and Szechuan.

1720
01:00:47,016 --> 01:00:50,019
And then I saw those lipsticks

1721
01:00:50,052 --> 01:00:52,421
and it made me more hungry

1722
01:00:52,488 --> 01:00:53,656
for the crown.

1723
01:00:58,327 --> 01:01:00,362
I don't know who to choose.

1724
01:01:00,396 --> 01:01:01,764
If it's Bernie,

1725
01:01:01,764 --> 01:01:02,464
or Kitty.

1726
01:01:02,464 --> 01:01:04,199
Both of them are trans women

1727
01:01:04,199 --> 01:01:06,568
that I am starting to love more

1728
01:01:06,568 --> 01:01:08,671
in this competition. So,

1729
01:01:08,704 --> 01:01:11,674
it's gonna be a very, very tough decision.

1730
01:01:14,743 --> 01:01:16,879
Let the grand winnowing of rice begin!

1731
01:01:17,079 --> 01:01:18,113
Just like this.

1732
01:01:20,149 --> 01:01:21,884
- Like this!
- Fuck you!

1733
01:01:23,552 --> 01:01:24,586
- Fuck you!

1734
01:01:29,491 --> 01:01:30,626
It’s so dusty!

1735
01:01:30,626 --> 01:01:31,560
So noisy!

1736
01:01:31,560 --> 01:01:32,695
I've made my decision.

1737
01:01:32,695 --> 01:01:34,563
Bring back my Miss Slay-gons.

1738
01:01:38,701 --> 01:01:40,636
Welcome back, ladies.

1739
01:01:41,637 --> 01:01:45,574
Two top Slaysian Divas stand before me!

1740
01:01:45,708 --> 01:01:46,642
Prior to tonight,

1741
01:01:46,642 --> 01:01:50,045
you were asked to prepare a lip sync performance of

1742
01:01:50,145 --> 01:01:52,881
"Cartoon Heroes" by Aqua.

1743
01:01:53,215 --> 01:01:54,350
Ladies.

1744
01:01:54,416 --> 01:01:56,585
This is your chance to impress me,

1745
01:01:56,618 --> 01:01:58,887
win 80,000 pesos,

1746
01:01:58,921 --> 01:02:00,856
and earn the power to give

1747
01:02:00,856 --> 01:02:02,958
one of the Bottom queens the

1748
01:02:02,991 --> 01:02:04,093
karate chop!

1749
01:02:04,093 --> 01:02:05,894
Hiya!

1750
01:02:08,097 --> 01:02:09,765
The time has come

1751
01:02:11,734 --> 01:02:13,836
for you to Lip Sync

1752
01:02:15,437 --> 01:02:17,606
for your Legacy!

1753
01:02:20,376 --> 01:02:22,010
To be performing against Arizona,

1754
01:02:22,010 --> 01:02:23,112
I got nervous because

1755
01:02:23,112 --> 01:02:25,848
we know Arizona is the queen of reveals,

1756
01:02:25,881 --> 01:02:27,483
queen of gimmicks,

1757
01:02:27,516 --> 01:02:28,717
campy queen.

1758
01:02:28,717 --> 01:02:31,754
But I also know what I can do.

1759
01:02:32,187 --> 01:02:35,257
Good luck, Queens and don't fuck it up.

1760
01:02:35,491 --> 01:02:36,392
I'm sorry Brigiding,

1761
01:02:36,392 --> 01:02:38,627
you may be the main character on the play,

1762
01:02:38,660 --> 01:02:39,862
but in this song,

1763
01:02:39,895 --> 01:02:42,431
I am the main characters.

1764
01:02:49,838 --> 01:02:53,642
We are what we're supposed to be

1765
01:02:53,675 --> 01:02:57,413
Illusions of your fantasy

1766
01:02:57,446 --> 01:03:00,682
All dots and lines that speak and say

1767
01:03:00,716 --> 01:03:04,620
What we do is what you wish to do

1768
01:03:04,853 --> 01:03:08,223
We are the color symphony

1769
01:03:08,624 --> 01:03:11,927
We do the things you wanna see

1770
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:15,664
Frame by frame to the extreme

1771
01:03:16,165 --> 01:03:19,668
Our friends are so unreasonable

1772
01:03:19,935 --> 01:03:23,405
They do the unpredictable

1773
01:03:23,672 --> 01:03:26,708
All dots and lines that speak and say

1774
01:03:26,742 --> 01:03:30,712
What we do is what you wish to do

1775
01:03:31,180 --> 01:03:34,683
It's all an orchestra of strings

1776
01:03:34,917 --> 01:03:37,920
Doing unbelievable things

1777
01:03:38,187 --> 01:03:41,690
Frame by frame to the extreme

1778
01:03:41,857 --> 01:03:45,227
One by one we're making it fun

1779
01:03:45,861 --> 01:03:49,665
We are the cartoon heroes, oh whoa

1780
01:03:49,698 --> 01:03:53,402
We are the ones who're gonna last forever

1781
01:03:53,435 --> 01:03:57,172
We came out of a crazy mind, oh whoa

1782
01:03:57,206 --> 01:04:00,476
And walked out on a piece of paper

1783
01:04:01,109 --> 01:04:02,778
Here comes Spider-Man,

1784
01:04:02,811 --> 01:04:04,346
Arachnophobian

1785
01:04:04,346 --> 01:04:08,217
Welcome to the toon town party

1786
01:04:08,650 --> 01:04:10,252
Here comes Superman

1787
01:04:10,252 --> 01:04:11,854
from never, never land

1788
01:04:11,854 --> 01:04:15,724
Welcome to the toon town party

1789
01:04:16,191 --> 01:04:19,495
You think we're so mysterious

1790
01:04:19,495 --> 01:04:23,198
Don't take us all too serious

1791
01:04:23,665 --> 01:04:26,768
Be original and remember that

1792
01:04:26,768 --> 01:04:30,572
What we do is what you just can't do

1793
01:04:30,706 --> 01:04:34,176
What we do is what you just can't do

1794
01:04:34,209 --> 01:04:37,946
What we do is what you just can't do

1795
01:04:37,980 --> 01:04:41,683
What we do is what you just can't do

1796
01:04:41,717 --> 01:04:45,454
What we do is what you just can't do

1797
01:04:45,888 --> 01:04:49,658
We are the cartoon heroes, oh whoa

1798
01:04:49,691 --> 01:04:53,428
We are the ones who're gonna last forever

1799
01:04:53,428 --> 01:04:57,165
We came out of a crazy mind, oh whoa

1800
01:04:57,199 --> 01:05:00,669
And walked out on a piece of paper

1801
01:05:01,136 --> 01:05:02,771
There's still more to come,

1802
01:05:02,804 --> 01:05:04,473
and everyone will be

1803
01:05:04,473 --> 01:05:07,009
welcomed at the toon,

1804
01:05:07,009 --> 01:05:07,943
toon,

1805
01:05:07,943 --> 01:05:08,877
town,

1806
01:05:08,911 --> 01:05:09,811
town,

1807
01:05:10,045 --> 01:05:14,216
party

1808
01:05:20,255 --> 01:05:23,392
Ladies, I have made my decision.

1809
01:05:27,663 --> 01:05:29,698
Arizona Brandy,

1810
01:05:30,866 --> 01:05:33,335
you are a winner, baby.

1811
01:05:33,402 --> 01:05:34,603
Condragulations!

1812
01:05:34,603 --> 01:05:38,507
You have won a cash tip worth 80,000 pesos.

1813
01:05:40,342 --> 01:05:41,610
- Thank you!
- And

1814
01:05:41,610 --> 01:05:43,679
you will also receive a RuBadge.

1815
01:05:43,679 --> 01:05:45,514
Give her a RuBadge!

1816
01:05:45,514 --> 01:05:46,815
Thank you, Lord.

1817
01:05:46,815 --> 01:05:50,452
Wear it with Slaysian Pride, Arizona Brandy.

1818
01:05:50,452 --> 01:05:51,219
Oh, my God.

1819
01:05:51,219 --> 01:05:52,821
So I finally won.

1820
01:05:52,854 --> 01:05:55,057
I've been waiting for this, you know.

1821
01:05:55,090 --> 01:05:57,025
I've been manifesting the RuBadge.

1822
01:05:57,059 --> 01:05:58,894
I don't have the RoBadge anymore.

1823
01:05:58,927 --> 01:06:01,163
I have the RuBadge.

1824
01:06:02,097 --> 01:06:04,199
Brigiding, my Brigiding you are safe.

1825
01:06:04,232 --> 01:06:04,666
Thank you.

1826
01:06:04,700 --> 01:06:06,101
You may join the other queens.

1827
01:06:06,101 --> 01:06:07,703
- Thank you.
- Congrats, sis!

1828
01:06:07,736 --> 01:06:09,538
Yes!

1829
01:06:10,105 --> 01:06:13,175
Now will the Bottom 2 queens

1830
01:06:13,208 --> 01:06:16,244
please step forward.

1831
01:06:22,517 --> 01:06:24,786
Arizona Brandy.

1832
01:06:26,421 --> 01:06:30,525
With great power from our Slaysian ancestors,

1833
01:06:30,592 --> 01:06:32,928
comes great responsibility.

1834
01:06:33,562 --> 01:06:36,865
Which queen have you chosen to give

1835
01:06:36,932 --> 01:06:38,867
the Karate Chop?

1836
01:06:40,602 --> 01:06:43,538
The person that I chose

1837
01:06:44,473 --> 01:06:47,509
is a beautiful woman.

1838
01:06:47,609 --> 01:06:49,011
And I know,

1839
01:06:49,077 --> 01:06:53,181
she's gonna do good after this.

1840
01:06:53,215 --> 01:06:55,617
So I choose...

1841
01:06:58,353 --> 01:07:00,756
Kitty Space.

1842
01:07:03,158 --> 01:07:06,595
As it is written, so it shall be done.

1843
01:07:06,628 --> 01:07:08,096
I love you so much.

1844
01:07:08,130 --> 01:07:10,465
Kitty Space,

1845
01:07:10,632 --> 01:07:13,702
our trans doll from France.

1846
01:07:13,869 --> 01:07:16,304
You are and will always be

1847
01:07:16,371 --> 01:07:20,008
a Slaysian sensation. Now,

1848
01:07:20,409 --> 01:07:21,743
au revoir.

1849
01:07:21,777 --> 01:07:23,512
And sashay away.

1850
01:07:23,545 --> 01:07:24,980
Thank you for everything.

1851
01:07:25,013 --> 01:07:27,449
You made me feel like a proud Asian.

1852
01:07:27,516 --> 01:07:29,351
And I want to continue to make

1853
01:07:29,351 --> 01:07:30,886
the French-Asian proud.

1854
01:07:30,886 --> 01:07:32,087
So thank you very much.

1855
01:07:32,120 --> 01:07:33,055
I'm sorry.

1856
01:07:34,022 --> 01:07:38,827
I'm sorry, sister.

1857
01:07:40,729 --> 01:07:42,497
As we say in French...

1858
01:07:42,698 --> 01:07:43,632
Liberty

1859
01:07:43,632 --> 01:07:44,900
Equality.

1860
01:07:44,933 --> 01:07:47,135
Trans identity!

1861
01:07:52,708 --> 01:07:56,078
Today, I realize I'm really proud of myself.

1862
01:07:56,111 --> 01:07:58,146
And I know why I do drag.

1863
01:07:58,180 --> 01:08:00,415
And I know why I still want to do drag.

1864
01:08:00,449 --> 01:08:03,085
So you'll see a new Kitty even better

1865
01:08:03,118 --> 01:08:05,620
with real boobs this time.

1866
01:08:07,856 --> 01:08:10,392
Mabuhay, accla!

1867
01:08:12,360 --> 01:08:14,296
Condragulations, Queens!

1868
01:08:14,296 --> 01:08:15,964
You all made your mothers proud.

1869
01:08:15,964 --> 01:08:17,532
You mothers are queens!

1870
01:08:17,532 --> 01:08:19,835
Your mother is a queen too!

1871
01:08:19,868 --> 01:08:22,104
And remember, always be true to yourself

1872
01:08:22,137 --> 01:08:23,772
in your thoughts, in your words,

1873
01:08:23,805 --> 01:08:24,973
and in all that you do.

1874
01:08:24,973 --> 01:08:27,042
All heart, always and in all ways.

1875
01:08:27,075 --> 01:08:29,678
Can I get an eme up in here?

1876
01:08:29,711 --> 01:08:31,346
Eme!

1877
01:08:31,379 --> 01:08:34,750
Now let the music play! Party! Party!

1878
01:08:45,327 --> 01:08:47,929
Next on Drag Race Philippines: Slaysian Royale.

1879
01:08:47,996 --> 01:08:50,098
So for this week's Maxi Challenge,

1880
01:08:50,098 --> 01:08:52,467
let's welcome our balikbayans!
(Overseas Filipinos coming home)

1881
01:08:52,801 --> 01:08:55,971
Transforming them as part of your drag family.

1882
01:08:55,971 --> 01:08:57,472
I am pretty good at, you know,

1883
01:08:57,472 --> 01:08:59,107
doing aesthetics and styling people,

1884
01:08:59,107 --> 01:09:00,909
so I want to see what I can pull off.

1885
01:09:01,042 --> 01:09:03,512
It was very obvious who the star was.

1886
01:09:03,912 --> 01:09:05,914
If you don't have anything good to say,

1887
01:09:05,981 --> 01:09:07,516
just shut the fuck up.

1888
01:09:07,582 --> 01:09:08,884
If international queens

1889
01:09:08,884 --> 01:09:10,285
are in the bottom again, you're gonna pick

1890
01:09:10,285 --> 01:09:11,219
to send an international queen home.

1891
01:09:11,219 --> 01:09:14,022
No, no! It's not that we're picking international queens, like,

1892
01:09:14,422 --> 01:09:16,391
For me, my reason was,

1893
01:09:16,424 --> 01:09:18,260
she tried to pick my lipstick.

1894
01:09:18,493 --> 01:09:19,995
But personally,

1895
01:09:20,562 --> 01:09:21,930
I thought...

1896
01:09:22,130 --> 01:09:23,665
Kitty should be safe.

1897
01:09:23,832 --> 01:09:26,668
Khianna, you shady ass bitch.
