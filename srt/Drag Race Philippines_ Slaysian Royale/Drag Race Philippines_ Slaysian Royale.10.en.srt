188
00:09:31,947 --> 00:09:34,850
I'm serving you Kenneth Cobonpue realness.

189
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:37,319
The amazing chair work of art.

190
00:09:37,319 --> 00:09:40,389
I feel like a work of art tonight.

191
00:09:40,623 --> 00:09:42,024
Bloom!

192
00:09:42,157 --> 00:09:44,259
Bloom, Panis!
(Boom, Panis! means owned or burned in Filipino street slang)

193
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,628
Bloom Tarat Tarat!
(Boom Tarat Tarat is a popular Filipino novelty song)

194
00:09:45,628 --> 00:09:47,129
Yo mama's bloom-ing!

195
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,669
- She's teasing us.
- Yes.

196
00:09:54,303 --> 00:09:56,138
Next, Brigiding.

197
00:09:57,373 --> 00:10:01,076
Hi, yellow, good bye.

198
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:04,446
On this Runway, I walk with a purpose.

199
00:10:04,446 --> 00:10:08,217
This gown carries the spirit of the thousands who marched

200
00:10:08,217 --> 00:10:09,918
at the EDSA revolution.

201
00:10:09,952 --> 00:10:14,089
A symbol of hope, of peace, of what we can become

202
00:10:14,123 --> 00:10:15,991
when we rise as one.

203
00:10:16,058 --> 00:10:18,160
This is more than a Runway.

204
00:10:18,227 --> 00:10:22,898
This is a revolution, a history that cannot be erased.

205
00:10:22,898 --> 00:10:24,733
This is power.

206
00:10:24,733 --> 00:10:27,302
Even a bird with freedom to fly.
(Lyrics of Bayan Ko, a Filipino patriotic song)

207
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:30,105
Yellow-k gorgeous!

208
00:10:30,139 --> 00:10:32,007
Yellow po!
(Hello po! “Po” is a Tagalog polite particle)

209
00:10:32,307 --> 00:10:33,609
Mama Bow!

210
00:10:33,609 --> 00:10:34,877
Ass-bow-le.

211
00:10:35,077 --> 00:10:36,545
“Fuck you!”

212
00:10:36,712 --> 00:10:38,814
Bow wow wow wow wow.

213
00:10:39,014 --> 00:10:40,816
Suki Doll.

214
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:43,952
She is a glow-getter.

215
00:10:44,753 --> 00:10:46,388
Have you seen the yellow bird?

216
00:10:46,388 --> 00:10:48,691
Yes, that's me, Suki Doll!

217
00:10:48,691 --> 00:10:52,227
This is where I present to you the pageant show girl in me.

218
00:10:52,294 --> 00:10:54,329
The dripping jewelry, and obviously

219
00:10:54,329 --> 00:10:56,732
this slow, sultry walk.

220
00:10:56,765 --> 00:11:00,335
I'm presenting to you, candidate number seven.

221
00:11:00,936 --> 00:11:02,938
She raided my closet.

222
00:11:02,938 --> 00:11:04,540
Return my dress.

223
00:11:05,374 --> 00:11:07,409
Now with the feather forecast.

224
00:11:07,409 --> 00:11:09,578
It's Suki Doll!

225
00:11:09,578 --> 00:11:10,813
Take life as is.

226
00:11:10,813 --> 00:11:13,482
What-feather will be, will be.

227
00:11:14,883 --> 00:11:17,486
And finally, Viñas DeLuxe.

228
00:11:19,354 --> 00:11:21,590
- Wow!
- Yes!

229
00:11:21,623 --> 00:11:24,526
Viñas! How's your head?

230
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:26,962
I want to be invisible.

231
00:11:26,995 --> 00:11:30,766
I want to represent Viñas DeLuxe as a young

232
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:34,236
gay kid who feels invisible.

233
00:11:34,236 --> 00:11:37,539
And then because of drag, it became my power.

234
00:11:37,573 --> 00:11:41,510
And now everybody looks at me with a smile on their faces.

235
00:11:41,744 --> 00:11:43,545
Oh!

236
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:48,484
Head’s in, body’s not around, when the body joins,
(Filipino popular street chant)

237
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:50,753
everything’s blown down.

238
00:11:55,457 --> 00:11:58,093
And now for the final Runway of this

239
00:11:58,127 --> 00:12:00,496
epic Slaysian Royale season,

240
00:12:00,562 --> 00:12:01,697
category is...

241
00:12:02,164 --> 00:12:04,533
“Come in Your Best Drag”

242
00:12:04,566 --> 00:12:07,870
Starting with, Arizona Brandy.

243
00:12:10,739 --> 00:12:13,408
- Orange you glad to see me, again?
- Yes.

244
00:12:13,408 --> 00:12:14,543
For my best drag,

245
00:12:14,576 --> 00:12:16,478
this is inspired by my promo look,

246
00:12:16,512 --> 00:12:19,848
but I'm going on an abstract-ball-gown route.

247
00:12:19,848 --> 00:12:21,917
Rhinestones everywhere,

248
00:12:21,917 --> 00:12:24,720
big earrings, big hair, big everything.

249
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,455
I'm giving you drag.

250
00:12:26,488 --> 00:12:28,190
I'm giving you the rebirth

251
00:12:28,524 --> 00:12:31,226
of the orange Arizona Brandy.

252
00:12:32,094 --> 00:12:36,865
She is the zest in long gown competition.

253
00:12:37,132 --> 00:12:38,534
Yes, you can,

254
00:12:38,534 --> 00:12:39,401
ponkan.

255
00:12:39,401 --> 00:12:42,638
I've never seen a vagina so orange.

256
00:12:43,238 --> 00:12:44,306
Brigiding.

257
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,942
Oh, you should see her black hole.

258
00:12:49,111 --> 00:12:51,480
This is the brightest star phenomenon.

259
00:12:51,547 --> 00:12:54,449
A sparkling universe swirling with moons,

260
00:12:54,449 --> 00:12:56,985
planets, and galaxies.

261
00:12:57,019 --> 00:13:00,355
We are all made of stars, but tonight,

262
00:13:00,355 --> 00:13:02,791
I shine brighter than the rest.

263
00:13:02,858 --> 00:13:05,427
She's a universe top.

264
00:13:05,961 --> 00:13:09,164
- Oh, a universe top?
- A uni-versa top.

265
00:13:09,164 --> 00:13:12,100
That's what's on her Grindr profile.

266
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:14,469
- Universe top.
- Oh!

267
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:18,173
She's uni-versatile, oh, my God.

268
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,042
Suki Doll.

269
00:13:22,544 --> 00:13:24,446
Blow it to my face.

270
00:13:27,649 --> 00:13:29,418
Have you seen the balloon pop?

271
00:13:29,451 --> 00:13:32,521
Well, under that is the true beauty, Suki.

272
00:13:32,588 --> 00:13:34,923
I am presenting to you a look that's very Harajuku

273
00:13:34,923 --> 00:13:37,159
and also obviously a wink to Wicked

274
00:13:37,326 --> 00:13:39,862
with a beautiful pink and green combo.

275
00:13:39,895 --> 00:13:42,965
Life in plastic, it's fantastic.

276
00:13:42,998 --> 00:13:44,399
Suki Doll

277
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:45,868
domination.

278
00:13:46,301 --> 00:13:48,303
Dollification.

279
00:13:48,303 --> 00:13:50,839
Doll shenanigans.

280
00:13:52,341 --> 00:13:54,443
Viñas DeLuxe.

281
00:13:55,978 --> 00:13:58,380
Let me get my slipper.

282
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:02,584
I'm serving you Cockroach Eleganza, missus, because

283
00:14:02,584 --> 00:14:04,486
when the world ends

284
00:14:04,486 --> 00:14:06,054
I'll be the last one standing.

285
00:14:06,054 --> 00:14:07,923
Only cockroaches will survive.

286
00:14:07,923 --> 00:14:09,391
When there's a cockroach,

287
00:14:09,424 --> 00:14:11,460
world peace will encroach. Kidding!

288
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:14,296
- She's about to take flight.
- She's taking flight.

289
00:14:16,665 --> 00:14:19,134
A flying cockroach!

290
00:14:22,404 --> 00:14:25,407
It's time to present a very special award.

291
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,776
This award is given to the Queen

292
00:14:27,809 --> 00:14:29,444
who embodied kindness,

293
00:14:29,444 --> 00:14:32,414
support, and sisterhood throughout the competition,

294
00:14:32,414 --> 00:14:34,283
spreading good vibes like a warm,

295
00:14:34,283 --> 00:14:37,052
comforting bowl of congee.

296
00:14:37,052 --> 00:14:38,453
The queens have spoken.

297
00:14:38,453 --> 00:14:40,656
And it's time to crown their Miss

298
00:14:40,989 --> 00:14:43,191
Congee-niality.

299
00:14:43,392 --> 00:14:45,961
Congee-niality?!

300
00:14:47,829 --> 00:14:52,634
And Slaysian Royale's Miss Congee-niality is...

301
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:56,171
Suki Doll!

302
00:14:56,171 --> 00:14:58,440
Yes, Suki!

303
00:14:58,907 --> 00:14:59,007
Her heart is so pure.

304
00:14:59,007 --> 00:15:01,743
Being a double-crowned Miss Congeniality,

305
00:15:02,411 --> 00:15:05,380
this is really a moment to celebrate.

306
00:15:05,414 --> 00:15:08,483
I'm very grateful that my sisters recognize that

307
00:15:08,517 --> 00:15:11,119
I truly love them, not from just words,

308
00:15:11,153 --> 00:15:13,021
but also through the actions I've done.

309
00:15:13,021 --> 00:15:15,190
It's sometimes good to be remembered

310
00:15:15,223 --> 00:15:16,525
that you have a heart of gold,

311
00:15:16,525 --> 00:15:17,993
but it's also good being recognized.

312
00:15:18,226 --> 00:15:19,962
She should be celebrated

313
00:15:19,962 --> 00:15:23,598
she is a very professional, talented,

314
00:15:23,598 --> 00:15:25,267
and a beautiful drag queen.

315
00:15:25,267 --> 00:15:27,636
Her heart is so pure.

316
00:15:27,769 --> 00:15:29,705
Con-Dragulations!

317
00:15:29,838 --> 00:15:30,839
Thank you!

318
00:15:30,839 --> 00:15:32,407
You deserve it!

319
00:15:33,608 --> 00:15:38,146
And now it's time for the grand TITE!

320
00:15:38,146 --> 00:15:40,048
Now, I ask you,

321
00:15:40,048 --> 00:15:42,484
who doesn't love TITE?

322
00:15:42,517 --> 00:15:44,953
What's TITE, Mama Pao?

323
00:15:45,354 --> 00:15:46,555
Let's ask Nymphia.

324
00:15:46,555 --> 00:15:48,090
- Nymphia, show us your TITE.

325
00:15:48,123 --> 00:15:48,824
Okay.

326
00:15:50,359 --> 00:15:51,259
No!

327
00:15:51,259 --> 00:15:55,897
Let's start our Slaysian Totally Impressive Talent Show Extravaganza!

328
00:15:55,897 --> 00:15:58,200
First, put your hands together for

329
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,402
Arizona Brandy.

330
00:16:01,003 --> 00:16:02,704
Get ready for my performance.

331
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:04,072
You’re gonna be gagged.

332
00:16:04,072 --> 00:16:07,376
It’s gonna be a roller coaster ride of emotions.

333
00:16:07,376 --> 00:16:08,677
You know, you’re gonna feel anything.

334
00:16:08,677 --> 00:16:10,946
You’re gonna feel every muscle of your body.

335
00:16:11,013 --> 00:16:12,014
Everything!

336
00:16:12,848 --> 00:16:14,216
Don’t get too close to whoever’s beside you

337
00:16:14,216 --> 00:16:16,218
‘cause you might hit them while...

338
00:16:16,218 --> 00:16:17,519
while watching my performance.

339
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,788
And this is my drag.

340
00:16:19,788 --> 00:16:21,456
Welcome to Arizona Brandy.

341
00:16:21,456 --> 00:16:23,125
This is how my mind works.

342
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:26,728
This performance is a reflection of my drag.

343
00:16:27,062 --> 00:16:27,796
Thank you.

344
00:16:37,873 --> 00:16:41,276
This world’s so cruel, it’s such a blow

345
00:16:41,276 --> 00:16:44,613
Where’s my drink?

346
00:16:45,013 --> 00:16:48,383
My throat is parched and dry

347
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:52,220
Quench my heart, don’t let it die

348
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:55,857
I am one gay

349
00:16:55,857 --> 00:16:58,693
Who wants to sip and sway

350
00:16:59,094 --> 00:17:02,397
Craving just one taste

351
00:17:02,731 --> 00:17:06,134
of one daddy's way

352
00:17:06,168 --> 00:17:09,604
Chug down your drink

353
00:17:09,604 --> 00:17:12,641
Booze so strong and true

354
00:17:12,641 --> 00:17:16,044
Pass out hard and cold

355
00:17:16,044 --> 00:17:21,083
But never say you're through

356
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:22,451
Yeah!

357
00:17:22,651 --> 00:17:24,086
Go, Arizona!

358
00:17:26,721 --> 00:17:28,090

359
00:17:28,356 --> 00:17:29,925
Arizona B

360
00:17:29,925 --> 00:17:31,760
B is for Budots
(A Filipino electronic dance music genre)

361
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:35,163
Budots, Budots, Budots, Budots!

362
00:17:35,263 --> 00:17:38,133
Arizona ready for the coronation

00:17:38,133 --> 00:17:41,670
She’s royalty and comedy, a true Slaysian

364
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:44,940
The other girls they tried, but to no epek (effect)

365
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:48,477
But I do it so good cause I’m what? Perpek! (Perfect)

366
00:17:48,477 --> 00:17:55,817
Perpek Pek Pek Pek Pek Pek Pek

00:18:02,657 --> 00:18:05,227
Drag Race Philippines, will you sing it with me?

371
00:18:05,227 --> 00:18:08,663
Brandy Shark Shark Shark Shark

372
00:18:08,663 --> 00:18:15,504
Brandy Shark Shark Shark Shark Shark

373
00:18:15,504 --> 00:18:16,872
Brandy Shark

374
00:18:17,172 --> 00:18:19,708
Drag Race Philippines, will you sing it with me?

375
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:21,510
Arizona B

376
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:23,245
- B is for Budots!
- Fierce!

377
00:18:23,245 --> 00:18:24,946
B is for Bold

378
00:18:24,946 --> 00:18:26,648
B is for Beautiful

379
00:18:26,681 --> 00:18:28,383
Arizona B

380
00:18:28,383 --> 00:18:29,885
B is for Budots!

381
00:18:29,885 --> 00:18:30,552
Bideoke

382
00:18:30,552 --> 00:18:31,553
Bery good

383
00:18:31,553 --> 00:18:34,489
B is for Bayot!
(Another word for gay from another Filipino language family)

384
00:18:34,589 --> 00:18:35,891
- Queen!
- Bitch!

385
00:18:35,891 --> 00:18:37,893
B is for Balls!

386
00:18:39,127 --> 00:18:40,495
Arizona Brandy.

387
00:18:40,529 --> 00:18:42,764
How does it feel to be in a finale again

388
00:18:42,797 --> 00:18:44,733
of Drag Race Philippines?

389
00:18:44,766 --> 00:18:47,669
It feels rewarding to be here again,

390
00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:49,871
to be able to prove myself that

391
00:18:49,871 --> 00:18:52,240
I'm still a good drag queen.

392
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,609
I was able to prove to everyone

393
00:18:54,643 --> 00:18:56,478
and to myself how good

394
00:18:56,511 --> 00:18:58,947
and how excellent my drag is.

395
00:18:58,947 --> 00:19:01,683
We know. It seems like you're on a mission to prove that you are

396
00:19:01,683 --> 00:19:04,586
worthy of your first runner-up placement during your season.

397
00:19:04,619 --> 00:19:05,387
Why?

398
00:19:05,387 --> 00:19:09,491
Because I'm always overlooked.

399
00:19:09,524 --> 00:19:12,360
When I was the first runner-up, I felt like

400
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:17,532
I'm holding a high torch for Marina, for Khianna,

401
00:19:17,532 --> 00:19:21,503
my fellow runner-ups, who are really amazing performers.

402
00:19:21,503 --> 00:19:23,438
I know my drag is different.

403
00:19:23,471 --> 00:19:25,106
I have learned that here.

404
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:26,942
I'm Arizona. I'm just me.

405
00:19:26,942 --> 00:19:29,844
And I'm so good at doing me.

406
00:19:29,878 --> 00:19:32,447
I know that you have this burden.

407
00:19:32,447 --> 00:19:35,951
People don't see you as an equal to Marina and Khianna.

408
00:19:35,984 --> 00:19:38,186
But let me tell you, Marina and Khianna

409
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:40,622
can never do what Arizona does.

410
00:19:41,323 --> 00:19:45,160
You are a queen in your own right.

411
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,261
So be proud of yourself.

412
00:19:46,294 --> 00:19:48,263
Who are you dedicating your journey to?

413
00:19:48,263 --> 00:19:51,566
I'm dedicating it to all the local Filipino queens

414
00:19:51,566 --> 00:19:54,736
who are sometimes just in the background.

415
00:19:54,736 --> 00:19:55,870
They can also do this.

416
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:57,739
Because I came from nothing.

417
00:19:57,739 --> 00:20:01,309
I still have the memory of when I started.

418
00:20:01,343 --> 00:20:06,114
I just stumbled upon a video of Jiggly Caliente on YouTube.

419
00:20:06,481 --> 00:20:08,016
That's how I started.

420
00:20:08,149 --> 00:20:09,985
I hope when they see me now,

421
00:20:09,985 --> 00:20:13,188
they'll be proud and they'll be inspired that

422
00:20:13,188 --> 00:20:15,290
everyone starts from nothing.

423
00:20:15,323 --> 00:20:16,658
Thank you very much.

424
00:20:16,691 --> 00:20:17,959
Arizona Brandy,

425
00:20:17,959 --> 00:20:21,129
someone wants to give you a special message.

426
00:20:21,997 --> 00:20:24,799
Hi, bunso! Love and miss you so much, my dear.
(Youngest child)

427
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:29,104
I know you're prepared for this competition and wish-come-true.

428
00:20:29,471 --> 00:20:31,072
Mama is so proud of you.

429
00:20:31,106 --> 00:20:32,507
Stay happy and blessed,

430
00:20:32,507 --> 00:20:34,509
and I'm your number one avid fan

431
00:20:34,509 --> 00:20:36,645
supporting you at all times.

432
00:20:37,078 --> 00:20:40,849
Especially for all your plans that are for your own good.

433
00:20:40,849 --> 00:20:42,484
Focus on your performance.

434
00:20:42,484 --> 00:20:45,353
You have great and amazing talent, my dear.

435
00:20:45,487 --> 00:20:47,455
Praying for you always that you have

436
00:20:47,455 --> 00:20:49,591
the strength and endurance

437
00:20:49,591 --> 00:20:51,426
to overcome challenges

438
00:20:51,426 --> 00:20:53,962
and the grace to remain calm under pressure.

439
00:20:53,995 --> 00:20:55,830
Whether you win or lose,

440
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:57,866
I'm always here to support you.

441
00:20:57,866 --> 00:21:00,935
Good luck, more power, and I'll be cheering for you.

442
00:21:00,935 --> 00:21:02,637
Stay humble and jolly.

443
00:21:02,771 --> 00:21:03,972
God bless you, always.

444
00:21:03,972 --> 00:21:05,507
A lot of people love you.

445
00:21:05,774 --> 00:21:07,776
And you make so many people, happy.

446
00:21:07,776 --> 00:21:09,077
See you soon, Arizona.

447
00:21:09,411 --> 00:21:11,146
I love you. We love you so much.

448
00:21:11,146 --> 00:21:12,814
Take care, God bless you.

449
00:21:16,217 --> 00:21:17,986
So sweet.

450
00:21:18,086 --> 00:21:22,057
My mom is like the Christian mother who goes to the choir,

451
00:21:22,057 --> 00:21:23,692
I always say this, but she

452
00:21:23,692 --> 00:21:26,628
sacrificed her religion for me.

453
00:21:26,661 --> 00:21:27,696
Step by step,

454
00:21:27,729 --> 00:21:30,632
she started to love who I am.

455
00:21:30,665 --> 00:21:32,734
If ever I win this,

456
00:21:32,734 --> 00:21:34,769
I'm giving all my prizes to my mom.

457
00:21:35,236 --> 00:21:37,939
I just don't care about the cash, I want her to

458
00:21:37,939 --> 00:21:39,107
live her life.

459
00:21:39,107 --> 00:21:42,110
I am so proud that she's my mother.

460
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:43,912
Thank you so much, Arizona Brandy.

461
00:21:43,912 --> 00:21:47,048
Thank you.

462
00:21:47,082 --> 00:21:50,719
Let's all stomp our heels for our second finalist,

463
00:21:50,719 --> 00:21:52,620
Brigiding.

464
00:21:53,588 --> 00:21:54,756
For my grand talent show,

465
00:21:54,756 --> 00:21:57,992
you will hear my story from Season 1

466
00:21:57,992 --> 00:22:00,562
to coming back into this competition.

467
00:22:00,562 --> 00:22:02,997
And to be reaching this far.

468
00:22:02,997 --> 00:22:04,999
What I have learned so far.

469
00:22:04,999 --> 00:22:07,135
I’ll just show you the best that I can do.

470
00:22:07,135 --> 00:22:10,271
And from learning is the new winning,

471
00:22:10,271 --> 00:22:12,507
to actually winning this competition.

472
00:22:12,507 --> 00:22:15,744
And I’m very very proud to show the real Brigiding

473
00:22:15,744 --> 00:22:18,380
and the star that I am in front of all of you.

474
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:30,825
Step to the left, step to the right

475
00:22:30,859 --> 00:22:32,627
Runway smile, I'm shining so bright

476
00:22:32,627 --> 00:22:34,496
Dripping in diamonds, dripping in grace

477
00:22:34,529 --> 00:22:36,197
Bringing you kicks, serving face to face

478
00:22:36,197 --> 00:22:37,832
I don't back down, I'm going to fight

479
00:22:37,832 --> 00:22:39,868
For you and the nation, that's just right

480
00:22:39,901 --> 00:22:41,870
Feathered and fierce, regal and grand

481
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:42,771
I'm the brand

482
00:22:42,771 --> 00:22:43,505
Understand?

483
00:22:43,505 --> 00:22:45,206
Shining foreva

484
00:22:45,206 --> 00:22:46,841
Your Divine Diva

485
00:22:46,841 --> 00:22:49,878
Are you ready to be entertained yeah?

486
00:22:50,645 --> 00:22:52,647
Sis just wait a while

487
00:22:52,647 --> 00:22:54,582
I'm coming back in style

488
00:22:54,582 --> 00:22:57,719
Shouting "crazy" all the while

489
00:22:57,719 --> 00:22:59,587
Heart-stirring, sashaying,

490
00:22:59,587 --> 00:23:00,922
Back in the ring

491
00:23:00,922 --> 00:23:04,292
Watch this legendary, gender-bending-ding-ding-ding

492
00:23:04,359 --> 00:23:07,996
Look slaying, game-changing, Queen reigning

493
00:23:07,996 --> 00:23:10,999
Head of the house, I'm mothering-ring-ring-ring

494
00:23:11,099 --> 00:23:14,035
Mother's here to slay

495
00:23:14,369 --> 00:23:17,705
I'm a star, Brigiding-ding-ding-ding-ding

496
00:23:18,373 --> 00:23:20,842
Mother's here to stay

497
00:23:21,943 --> 00:23:24,212
Learning is the new winning

498
00:23:33,521 --> 00:23:35,256
Mama knows best, I run the biz

499
00:23:35,256 --> 00:23:37,325
Think the crown is yours? You're funny, sis

500
00:23:37,325 --> 00:23:38,760
Head held high, no doubts inside

501
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,762
It's Brigi-fucking-ding-ding, bitches move aside

502
00:23:40,762 --> 00:23:42,564
All the gays, and all the queens

503
00:23:42,597 --> 00:23:44,132
I'm your queen mother Brigiding-ding

504
00:23:44,165 --> 00:23:46,034
A queen with a legacy, so bright I'm shinin'

505
00:23:46,067 --> 00:23:48,002
The stars don't lie, Brigiding for the win

506
00:23:48,002 --> 00:23:49,704
Shining foreva

507
00:23:49,704 --> 00:23:51,272
Your Divine Diva

508
00:23:51,272 --> 00:23:54,442
Are you ready to be entertained yeah?

509
00:23:55,109 --> 00:23:56,911
Sis just wait a while

510
00:23:56,911 --> 00:23:58,947
I'm coming back in style

511
00:23:58,947 --> 00:24:01,950
Shouting "crazy" all the while

512
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:03,952
Heart-stirring, sashaying

513
00:24:03,952 --> 00:24:05,386
Back in the ring

514
00:24:05,386 --> 00:24:09,190
Watch this legendary, gender-bending-ding-ding-ding-ding

515
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:12,360
Look slaying, game-changing, Queen reigning

00:24:19,634 --> 00:24:21,035
I'm a star

518
00:24:23,438 --> 00:24:26,007
Brigiding-ding-ding-ding-ding

519
00:24:26,341 --> 00:24:28,676
Mama's here to slay

520
00:24:29,143 --> 00:24:31,379
Learning is the new winning

521
00:24:31,379 --> 00:24:33,281
I'm a star, you're a star

522
00:24:33,281 --> 00:24:34,883
We're all stars

523
00:24:34,983 --> 00:24:37,652
But my victory is at hand

524
00:24:37,652 --> 00:24:40,321
'Cause darling

525
00:24:40,755 --> 00:24:42,624
Winning is my brand

526
00:24:43,124 --> 00:24:44,025
Yes!

527
00:24:44,726 --> 00:24:47,695
- Go, Brigiding!
- Ding, ding, ding!

528
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:49,364
Brigding.

529
00:24:49,364 --> 00:24:51,499
You did well all throughout the season.

530
00:24:51,533 --> 00:24:54,736
What would you say to people who still doubt you

531
00:24:54,769 --> 00:24:57,405
and call you a brandless queen?

532
00:24:57,405 --> 00:25:00,141
With this whole competition, I was able to show them

533
00:25:00,141 --> 00:25:01,142
who I really am.

534
00:25:01,142 --> 00:25:04,746
And I'm very thankful because if not for them, and this show,

535
00:25:04,779 --> 00:25:08,316
I wouldn't be realizing my fullest potential and who I really am.

536
00:25:08,349 --> 00:25:09,651
Just like what I said

537
00:25:09,651 --> 00:25:11,719
when I exited during season one,

538
00:25:11,719 --> 00:25:14,789
that I'm excited to rediscover myself

539
00:25:14,789 --> 00:25:16,124
and learn more about myself.

540
00:25:16,124 --> 00:25:18,326
So, thank you so much to everyone.

541
00:25:18,459 --> 00:25:19,527
You had a RuBirth.

542
00:25:19,561 --> 00:25:21,763
- RuBirth.
- Ru-incarnation.

543
00:25:21,763 --> 00:25:25,033
Ru-incarnation, yes.

544
00:25:25,066 --> 00:25:26,534
Your brand is being the professional

545
00:25:26,534 --> 00:25:28,102
and the brightest star, you know.

546
00:25:28,136 --> 00:25:29,370
- Thank you.
- Your glow?

547
00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:32,440
All throughout the season, we really felt the fire in you.

548
00:25:32,473 --> 00:25:34,342
What brought about this change?

549
00:25:34,375 --> 00:25:37,211
I honestly feel like I was humbled during Season 1.

550
00:25:37,211 --> 00:25:39,781
And I really had to work harder.

551
00:25:39,814 --> 00:25:42,150
With everything that happened after Season 1,

552
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:44,252
I was able to put myself back up,

553
00:25:44,285 --> 00:25:47,121
to trying new things, exploring, and

554
00:25:47,121 --> 00:25:50,091
more importantly, to share what I already have.

555
00:25:50,124 --> 00:25:52,260
So what does winning the crown mean to you, Brigiding?

556
00:25:52,293 --> 00:25:55,463
Winning the crown, Mama Pao, will be a testament

557
00:25:55,496 --> 00:25:58,566
that learning is the new winning.

558
00:25:58,633 --> 00:26:01,336
Even in your darkest moments, you can

559
00:26:01,336 --> 00:26:04,539
find that love inside of you and use that

560
00:26:04,539 --> 00:26:07,041
to light yourself and others around you.

561
00:26:07,041 --> 00:26:08,109
Things will change,

562
00:26:08,109 --> 00:26:09,477
your time will come,

563
00:26:09,477 --> 00:26:12,146
and you will win.

564
00:26:13,314 --> 00:26:16,317
Brigidng, someone wants to send you a message.

565
00:26:16,317 --> 00:26:17,452
Oh!

566
00:26:18,753 --> 00:26:20,088
Ding ding ding!

567
00:26:20,088 --> 00:26:21,456
- Oh my God!
- Hello, babe.

568
00:26:21,456 --> 00:26:22,323
Hi.

569
00:26:23,858 --> 00:26:26,761
I just want to say congratulations

570
00:26:26,794 --> 00:26:29,964
on making it this far in the competition.

571
00:26:31,566 --> 00:26:34,035
You deserve it. I know you deserve this.

572
00:26:34,068 --> 00:26:37,605
All this glory that you are receiving right now, these,

573
00:26:37,605 --> 00:26:41,175
these are the things that you have dreamt of.

574
00:26:41,275 --> 00:26:45,179
I'm just so happy to see all the good things

575
00:26:45,179 --> 00:26:47,181
unfolding in front of you.

576
00:26:47,348 --> 00:26:51,619
Know that I am here all the way,

577
00:26:51,819 --> 00:26:54,822
and that your family, your friends, your

578
00:26:54,822 --> 00:26:59,193
Team Brigiding Darlings are here rooting for you.

579
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:01,896
I am so, so, so excited.

580
00:27:02,597 --> 00:27:05,366
God, I miss you so much, but

581
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:09,370
yeah, I'm so excited to hear all the good stories that

582
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:11,773
you have for us when you return.

583
00:27:13,841 --> 00:27:16,644
That was Kevin, your boyfriend.

584
00:27:16,644 --> 00:27:19,313
He's the one who taught me to be sensitive

585
00:27:19,781 --> 00:27:21,115
to listen, to feel,

586
00:27:21,115 --> 00:27:23,351
instead of using my head all the time.

587
00:27:23,351 --> 00:27:26,187
I think I would not be here in front of you as

588
00:27:26,187 --> 00:27:28,690
this version of myself if it was not for him as well.

589
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:30,358
So I love you so much, Kevin.

590
00:27:30,358 --> 00:27:31,559
Thank you for your message.

591
00:27:31,559 --> 00:27:32,627
I'll see you.

592
00:27:34,028 --> 00:27:36,130
- Get that lucky bitch with the boyfriend.
- Can't believe it.

593
00:27:36,664 --> 00:27:38,099
Thank you so much, Brigiding.

594
00:27:38,099 --> 00:27:40,168
Thank you so much, Mama Pao.

595
00:27:40,301 --> 00:27:42,603
Let's call in our next finalist,

596
00:27:42,837 --> 00:27:45,540
Suki Doll.

597
00:27:45,807 --> 00:27:46,774
I think...

598
00:27:46,774 --> 00:27:48,676
One of the most important thing for me

599
00:27:48,676 --> 00:27:50,378
in my talent show is

600
00:27:50,845 --> 00:27:53,815
what reason I came here to Slaysian Royale.

601
00:27:53,815 --> 00:27:56,117
It’s to connect back to my roots,

602
00:27:56,117 --> 00:27:57,618
celebrate my heritage.

603
00:27:57,618 --> 00:28:00,621
And like we say it itself, in the name, it’s “Slaysian Royale.”

604
00:28:00,621 --> 00:28:03,725
It is my Asian heritage that is royalty to me.

605
00:28:03,725 --> 00:28:05,760
To my blood. That I want to celebrate.

606
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,463
So, we have to expect that I celebrate my roots

607
00:28:08,463 --> 00:28:11,099
in the most cultural and the most respectful way.

608
00:29:01,048 --> 00:29:04,852
Suki, it is mom.

609
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:09,323
My child, you are my love.

610
00:29:09,323 --> 00:29:11,692
I know you are my everything,

611
00:29:11,692 --> 00:29:12,226
Wow.

612
00:29:12,226 --> 00:29:15,897
you will always be in my heart.

613
00:29:18,633 --> 00:29:22,036
Thank you mom for believing in me

614
00:29:23,104 --> 00:29:25,673
in my heart you’re my beloved mother and my everything

615
00:29:26,107 --> 00:29:27,675
No matter what you choose to do,

616
00:29:27,675 --> 00:29:29,443
happiness is more important than anything else.

617
00:29:29,443 --> 00:29:31,012
Mom I miss you.

618
00:29:31,312 --> 00:29:34,282
In my lifetime, I will never be able

619
00:29:34,282 --> 00:29:37,518
to repay you for sacrificing your youth

620
00:29:37,518 --> 00:29:41,622
and taking care of me all your life.

621
00:29:42,256 --> 00:29:44,826
Thank you, Mom, for always believing in me.

622
00:29:53,668 --> 00:29:54,802
Suki Doll.

623
00:29:54,802 --> 00:29:57,905
Can you explain to us what was your talent?

624
00:29:57,905 --> 00:30:00,875
So in my talent, I wanted to do a storytelling about

625
00:30:00,875 --> 00:30:03,611
my art, of where I became a drag queen

626
00:30:03,611 --> 00:30:05,580
and how I was accepted by my mother.

627
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:09,884
It is also a dying art from my heritage, which is Cambodia.

628
00:30:09,884 --> 00:30:11,719
And this is the Lakhon Khol,

629
00:30:11,752 --> 00:30:14,722
and it is also the role of Apsara, that I presented today.

630
00:30:14,722 --> 00:30:18,125
I really want to give more visibility to our country's art,

631
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:20,995
and also, it's an art that I've seen my mother perform before.

632
00:30:20,995 --> 00:30:23,264
And so the marriage of everything together,

633
00:30:23,297 --> 00:30:24,966
gave you that talent show today.

634
00:30:24,966 --> 00:30:27,335
What was it like discovering and celebrating

635
00:30:27,335 --> 00:30:29,971
other Asian cultures this season, Suki?

636
00:30:29,971 --> 00:30:32,406
Some days it was overwhelming

637
00:30:32,406 --> 00:30:34,108
because I'm doing a competition,

638
00:30:34,108 --> 00:30:35,276
I'm trying to focus,

639
00:30:35,276 --> 00:30:36,477
I'm learning a new language,

640
00:30:36,477 --> 00:30:37,879
I'm in a country, I don't know.

641
00:30:37,912 --> 00:30:40,381
But I think it's so rich,

642
00:30:40,381 --> 00:30:44,719
it's so powerful to embrace a situation and a place

643
00:30:44,719 --> 00:30:46,954
that you do not understand

644
00:30:46,954 --> 00:30:49,590
and to be able to adapt and be resilient in it.

645
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:53,160
It also makes you flexible to anything that happens,

646
00:30:53,194 --> 00:30:55,630
and I just loved every part of it.

647
00:30:55,663 --> 00:30:58,466
Suki Doll, being the only international queen,

648
00:30:58,499 --> 00:31:00,268
what does winning the crown mean to you?

649
00:31:00,334 --> 00:31:01,969
Being an international queen that

650
00:31:01,969 --> 00:31:04,038
was born in a foreign land

651
00:31:04,038 --> 00:31:06,307
that was not my own culture and heritage,

652
00:31:06,307 --> 00:31:07,608
I think representing,

653
00:31:07,608 --> 00:31:10,411
as an international queen myself, as Suki Doll,

654
00:31:10,411 --> 00:31:12,380
with the crown of Slaysian Royale

655
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:15,516
represents also a facet of the Asian community that is queer,

656
00:31:15,516 --> 00:31:18,519
that is not represented as often, that doesn't have

657
00:31:18,552 --> 00:31:20,955
the chance to be in their own countries,

658
00:31:20,955 --> 00:31:23,424
that are embracing the culture,

659
00:31:23,424 --> 00:31:26,327
that are able to be with people that look like themselves

660
00:31:26,327 --> 00:31:28,963
or to have that love, to be surrounded by it,

661
00:31:28,963 --> 00:31:30,398
the same way I feel right now.

662
00:31:30,431 --> 00:31:32,533
Having me as a representation of that

663
00:31:32,533 --> 00:31:36,003
facet of the queer community is just

664
00:31:36,003 --> 00:31:38,239
what matters the most to me also, personally.

665
00:31:38,272 --> 00:31:40,474
Thank you very much, Suki Doll.

666
00:31:40,508 --> 00:31:42,176
We have a message for you.

667
00:31:42,209 --> 00:31:44,345
Sister, congratulations.

668
00:31:44,378 --> 00:31:47,348
I am so proud of you.

669
00:31:47,348 --> 00:31:48,849
Not only am I proud of you,

670
00:31:48,849 --> 00:31:51,285
but I absolutely miss you.

671
00:31:51,319 --> 00:31:54,555
It has been the longest time since I've seen you,

672
00:31:54,555 --> 00:31:57,091
since we've had our amazing conversations.

673
00:31:57,591 --> 00:32:00,761
I know for me personally, when I first met you

674
00:32:00,761 --> 00:32:02,730
on Season 2 in Canada,

675
00:32:03,164 --> 00:32:05,967
I just knew that we would be best friends.

676
00:32:05,967 --> 00:32:08,302
Not only that we would be best friends,

677
00:32:08,703 --> 00:32:10,504
but that we would be family.

678
00:32:10,538 --> 00:32:13,240
That together we would change the world.

679
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:15,076
You would change the world.

680
00:32:15,076 --> 00:32:19,413
As an AAPI International Mother icon,

681
00:32:19,413 --> 00:32:21,983
you have changed the face of drag.

682
00:32:21,983 --> 00:32:25,019
You have changed the face of Canadian Drag.

683
00:32:25,019 --> 00:32:29,790
I, your family, all of Canada is absolutely rooting you on.

684
00:32:29,991 --> 00:32:32,226
Keep striving for that crown.

685
00:32:32,226 --> 00:32:34,628
Keep doing you.

686
00:32:34,628 --> 00:32:35,863
You are perfect.

687
00:32:35,896 --> 00:32:37,131
You are beautiful

688
00:32:37,131 --> 00:32:38,899
and I love you.

689
00:32:38,899 --> 00:32:40,868
Congratulations.

690
00:32:42,636 --> 00:32:43,437
Hi, Suki.

691
00:32:43,437 --> 00:32:44,271
My beloved child,

692
00:32:44,638 --> 00:32:46,374
our family is so proud of you.

693
00:32:46,874 --> 00:32:48,676
Our family is very happy and joyful

694
00:32:48,676 --> 00:32:50,177
to have you in our life.

695
00:32:50,344 --> 00:32:51,846
Mami wish you success.

696
00:32:51,979 --> 00:32:53,481
Mami love you. Mwah!

697
00:32:54,215 --> 00:32:55,416
Hi, Suki.

698
00:32:55,449 --> 00:32:58,486
I want to thank you for everything you do for the family.

699
00:32:58,886 --> 00:33:00,888
I'm so proud of how far you've come

700
00:33:00,888 --> 00:33:03,024
and everything you've accomplished.

701
00:33:03,090 --> 00:33:06,027
I love you very much, and we'll see you soon.

702
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:08,162
- Bye!
- Bye-bye!

703
00:33:09,163 --> 00:33:10,798
Suki Doll!

704
00:33:11,699 --> 00:33:13,467
How supportive is your mom

705
00:33:13,501 --> 00:33:14,902
of your drag career?

706
00:33:15,002 --> 00:33:17,038
My mom is the first person who

707
00:33:17,038 --> 00:33:20,341
paired my earrings with the dress that I was wearing.

708
00:33:20,341 --> 00:33:23,444
She is also the first one that found out I was doing drag.

709
00:33:23,477 --> 00:33:26,013
She picked the dresses from my sister's closet

710
00:33:26,047 --> 00:33:27,782
and said it looked better on me.

711
00:33:27,815 --> 00:33:28,516
She said

712
00:33:28,516 --> 00:33:30,151
she always knew that I was gonna be the

713
00:33:30,151 --> 00:33:31,485
third daughter that she wanted.

714
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:32,420
She's—

715
00:33:33,087 --> 00:33:35,589
My mother has always supported me in anything I've done

716
00:33:35,589 --> 00:33:37,358
and I've chosen in my life, and

717
00:33:37,358 --> 00:33:39,760
not only has she given me the life that I have today,

718
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,262
I wouldn't have been

719
00:33:41,262 --> 00:33:44,432
even alive today if it wasn't for her, and

720
00:33:44,865 --> 00:33:47,868
for every support that she's given to me,

721
00:33:47,868 --> 00:33:50,304
every moment that I've shared with her, I just

722
00:33:50,304 --> 00:33:52,506
am very thankful because today

723
00:33:52,506 --> 00:33:55,309
I am able to give back that love to everyone around me

724
00:33:55,342 --> 00:33:56,911
and be the mother that she was to me.

725
00:33:56,944 --> 00:33:59,346
And that's the first thing she taught me to be, a mother.

726
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:02,383
And how about your friend, Icesis Couture?

727
00:34:03,717 --> 00:34:04,985
That old hag.

728
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,422
We share so many memories.

729
00:34:08,422 --> 00:34:11,192
I mean, she's my brother, she's my sister, she's my other half.

730
00:34:11,192 --> 00:34:12,326
When you see this girl,

731
00:34:12,359 --> 00:34:14,028
I can't wait to see you and give you a big hug

732
00:34:14,028 --> 00:34:15,696
because you are really

733
00:34:15,729 --> 00:34:18,499
my support system, and we've built each other up.

734
00:34:18,532 --> 00:34:20,768
And I never knew that in Drag Race

735
00:34:20,768 --> 00:34:22,570
or even in a drag career,

736
00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:23,904
you can have somebody that's

737
00:34:23,904 --> 00:34:26,373
your better half that's going to push you even further

738
00:34:26,373 --> 00:34:28,075
than what you are capable of.

739
00:34:28,075 --> 00:34:30,945
Not only your artistry, but as a person to be even better.

740
00:34:30,945 --> 00:34:32,480
So thank you, sister.

741
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,080
I love you.

742
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,982
Thank you very much, Suki Doll.

743
00:34:34,982 --> 00:34:35,983
Thank you, also.

744
00:34:36,283 --> 00:34:37,251
Thank you so much.

745
00:34:37,551 --> 00:34:39,620
And finally, make some noise for

746
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,722
Viñas DeLuxe.

747
00:34:42,990 --> 00:34:46,093
I will do the best that Viñas is.

748
00:34:46,093 --> 00:34:47,728
So I will do what Viñas is.

749
00:34:47,728 --> 00:34:50,531
So expect Viñas on that stage.

750
00:34:50,531 --> 00:34:52,299
But on another level!

751
00:34:52,299 --> 00:34:54,235
So, I’m excited to showcase...

752
00:34:54,602 --> 00:34:55,302

753
00:34:59,974 --> 00:35:02,843

Lemme get to that hall of fame oh divine!

771
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:38,546

00:35:38,546 --> 00:35:40,181
Shout "Misis" clear and proud!

773
00:35:40,181 --> 00:35:42,349

00:35:42,349 --> 00:35:44,485
I'm the boss, I'm the queen, this is it, MISIS IT!

775
00:35:44,485 --> 00:35:46,620

00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:48,389
Shout "Misis" clear and proud!

777
00:35:48,389 --> 00:35:50,391
Kalabog kalakitch, kala bwakanabitch

778
00:35:50,391 --> 00:35:52,760
I'm the boss, I'm the queen, this is it, MISIS IT!

779
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:56,363
Mouth so wide

780
00:35:56,363 --> 00:36:00,768
The very thing I used to hide

781
00:36:00,768 --> 00:36:04,738
Now I've healed my inner child

782
00:36:04,738 --> 00:36:08,642
Maybe you might be inspired

783
00:36:08,642 --> 00:36:12,413
Lips so big

784
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:16,684
A gift I own with so much pride

785
00:36:16,850 --> 00:36:20,487
It is now my claim to fame

786
00:36:20,487 --> 00:36:24,758
Let your lips say my name

787
00:36:24,758 --> 00:36:25,492
Misis it!

788
00:36:25,492 --> 00:36:26,794
It’s my time

789
00:36:26,794 --> 00:36:27,661
Misis it!

790
00:36:27,661 --> 00:36:28,963
That crown is mine

791
00:36:28,963 --> 00:36:29,663
Misis it!

792
00:36:29,663 --> 00:36:31,165
I was born for this

793
00:36:31,165 --> 00:36:31,865
Misis it!

794
00:36:31,865 --> 00:36:33,734
Read my lips
(Misis it)

795
00:36:33,734 --> 00:36:35,569
I’m the ultimate
(Misis it)

796
00:36:35,569 --> 00:36:37,838
I’m sure as fate
(Misis it)

797
00:36:37,838 --> 00:36:39,807
For the representASIAN
(Misis it)

798
00:36:39,807 --> 00:36:47,615
Asian sensASIAN
(Misis it)

799
00:36:49,483 --> 00:36:52,953
I ain't called the National Mouth for nothin'

800
00:37:04,465 --> 00:37:05,966
Smells like victory!

801
00:37:07,835 --> 00:37:08,802
Yes!

802
00:37:13,507 --> 00:37:14,742
Viñas.

803
00:37:15,142 --> 00:37:17,745
You really stepped out of the box this season

804
00:37:17,778 --> 00:37:20,381
from your looks, to your performances.

805
00:37:20,381 --> 00:37:22,383
Your brain is on another level.

806
00:37:23,017 --> 00:37:24,852
Where did you get your ideas?

807
00:37:24,952 --> 00:37:26,253
It's from all the fat I eat.

808
00:37:26,253 --> 00:37:28,155
I'm kidding, of course.

809
00:37:28,188 --> 00:37:29,790
Of course, with the help of my friends,

810
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:31,625
and I always want to

811
00:37:31,625 --> 00:37:34,395
think outside of the box, I don't want to

812
00:37:34,428 --> 00:37:36,297
blend in, I want to

813
00:37:36,330 --> 00:37:38,632
be unique and

814
00:37:38,666 --> 00:37:41,402
I want to top, whatever I've already done before.

815
00:37:41,402 --> 00:37:43,003
So wait, so you're a top?

816
00:37:43,504 --> 00:37:45,639
Vers... I'm kidding.

817
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:48,509
Versa-tile. I'm versatile in drag.

818
00:37:48,609 --> 00:37:49,743
Oh!

819
00:37:49,777 --> 00:37:53,314
How would you describe your journey here in Slaysian Royale?

820
00:37:53,314 --> 00:37:55,683
After the Season 1, I tried

821
00:37:55,683 --> 00:37:59,153
vocal trainings, dance trainings,

822
00:37:59,153 --> 00:38:01,155
hosting, makeup...

823
00:38:01,188 --> 00:38:03,157
I tried...

824
00:38:03,157 --> 00:38:04,925
Science. It made me a new nose.

825
00:38:05,192 --> 00:38:09,263
And then, this is me now, and I'm so happy

826
00:38:09,296 --> 00:38:10,764
with my run.

827
00:38:10,764 --> 00:38:13,300
Here in Slaysian Royale, I was able

828
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:16,637
to showcase everything that I have once again

829
00:38:16,637 --> 00:38:18,339
and with flying colors, even.

830
00:38:19,239 --> 00:38:21,775
What does winning the crown mean to you, Viñas DeLuxe?

831
00:38:21,775 --> 00:38:24,912
Winning this crown will be the measure

832
00:38:24,912 --> 00:38:28,982
of how growth can bring you to places.

833
00:38:29,016 --> 00:38:31,952
And I want to tell the kids that

834
00:38:31,952 --> 00:38:34,288
you only have to be whoever you are because

835
00:38:34,288 --> 00:38:38,359
someday, you will flourish in all the things you do

836
00:38:38,359 --> 00:38:40,661
and you will be celebrated because of that.

837
00:38:40,728 --> 00:38:43,597
And that is the quintessential

838
00:38:43,964 --> 00:38:46,867
essence of the crown, to me.

839
00:38:47,368 --> 00:38:50,337
And thank you very much, Candidate No. 4.

840
00:38:50,771 --> 00:38:52,406
Viñas DeLuxe.

841
00:38:52,439 --> 00:38:55,542
Someone wants to give you a special message.

842
00:38:56,610 --> 00:38:58,212
Hi, Christian.

843
00:38:58,746 --> 00:39:00,214
How are you doing?

844
00:39:00,447 --> 00:39:02,583
We miss you so much.

845
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:05,886
You are talented, and you always amaze us

846
00:39:05,886 --> 00:39:09,990
with everything you can do.

847
00:39:10,023 --> 00:39:15,562
And that will be your stepping stone to your brightest future.

848
00:39:15,763 --> 00:39:18,432
Best of luck, Christian.

849
00:39:18,432 --> 00:39:20,434
You can do it.

850
00:39:20,434 --> 00:39:24,638
You are our superstar, Viñas DeLuxe.

851
00:39:24,638 --> 00:39:26,039
We love you.

852
00:39:28,108 --> 00:39:29,376
I thought your dad was going to say

853
00:39:29,376 --> 00:39:30,911
“Good luck and don't fuck it up.”

854
00:39:30,911 --> 00:39:33,113
I thought he was making a move for my job.

855
00:39:34,448 --> 00:39:37,751
What can you say about your parents?

856
00:39:38,852 --> 00:39:40,854
I'm crying because

857
00:39:40,854 --> 00:39:43,390
I think this is the first time I heard

858
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:45,926
Daddy say that I'm amazing.

859
00:39:46,026 --> 00:39:49,730
Because of his care for me, he didn't want me to become gay and

860
00:39:49,763 --> 00:39:53,667
he would scold me whenever I would sing loudly at home.

861
00:39:53,834 --> 00:39:56,470
But I'm so happy because

862
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:59,606
they're making it up to me now and

863
00:39:59,606 --> 00:40:00,974
I also want to

864
00:40:01,008 --> 00:40:05,679
rebuild our relationship with each other, my parents and I.

865
00:40:05,679 --> 00:40:07,714
Especially now that they're seniors,

866
00:40:07,714 --> 00:40:09,082
I want to

867
00:40:09,383 --> 00:40:10,784
make the most

868
00:40:10,818 --> 00:40:14,521
of their time, while they're still with us.

869
00:40:14,521 --> 00:40:17,624
And now, if I win, I'll buy you a house.

870
00:40:17,691 --> 00:40:20,160
Thank you so much, Viñas DeLuxe.

871
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,161
Thank you.

872
00:40:21,528 --> 00:40:22,930
Thank you very much.

873
00:40:23,464 --> 00:40:26,266
Now the judges and I will deliberate.

874
00:40:26,266 --> 00:40:30,170
You may leave the stage, and evaporate, condensate,

875
00:40:30,170 --> 00:40:32,005
and precipitate,

876
00:40:32,005 --> 00:40:35,342
just like the water cycle.

877
00:40:36,176 --> 00:40:38,378
- Thank you!
- Thank you, Viñas.

878
00:40:41,014 --> 00:40:43,650
Now judges, what can you say about the Runway and

879
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:45,552
talents of our Top 4?

880
00:40:45,619 --> 00:40:47,821
Are you all totally impressed?

881
00:40:47,855 --> 00:40:49,523
First up, Arizona Brandy.

882
00:40:49,523 --> 00:40:51,525
I had so much fun.

883
00:40:51,758 --> 00:40:55,529
with Arizona Brandy and her whole package, this finale.

884
00:40:55,562 --> 00:40:58,966
I would say her package was a little bit

885
00:40:58,999 --> 00:41:00,434
weaker than the other girls.

886
00:41:00,467 --> 00:41:02,503
It's the finale and I wish

887
00:41:02,503 --> 00:41:05,138
there was a little bit more polish when it comes to the looks.

888
00:41:05,172 --> 00:41:09,877
but what I love about her is, she still gives an ode to Filipino drag.

889
00:41:09,877 --> 00:41:12,479
And I love that she brings that everywhere she goes.

890
00:41:12,546 --> 00:41:15,182
I would say the talent and the performance is

891
00:41:15,182 --> 00:41:17,484
where she truly shines as a drag queen.

892
00:41:17,518 --> 00:41:20,354
And you can really see her personality shine through.

893
00:41:20,587 --> 00:41:22,189
Next up, Brigiding.

894
00:41:22,189 --> 00:41:25,325
We see her deliver every single time.

895
00:41:25,425 --> 00:41:28,295
- Brigiding is through and through a professional.
- Yes.

896
00:41:28,295 --> 00:41:31,331
Her Runway package was very, very strong.

897
00:41:31,331 --> 00:41:33,233
But her talent show?

898
00:41:33,233 --> 00:41:34,601
That was so much fun to watch.

899
00:41:34,601 --> 00:41:37,404
She hit every single mark on that stage.

900
00:41:37,404 --> 00:41:39,573
Every single lip sync was tight,

901
00:41:39,573 --> 00:41:41,475
every single choreography.

902
00:41:41,475 --> 00:41:44,177
You can see Brigiding is definitely a more seasoned queen.

903
00:41:44,177 --> 00:41:47,114
Very polished, and everything's very calculated.

904
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:49,216
But overall, I think what she presented is

905
00:41:49,249 --> 00:41:50,817
very high quality.

906
00:41:50,817 --> 00:41:53,420
Yes. Brigiding is a star.

907
00:41:53,554 --> 00:41:55,322
Next up, Suki Doll.

908
00:41:55,889 --> 00:41:59,126
Suki Doll is definitely the fashion queen of the season.

909
00:41:59,126 --> 00:42:01,929
You could see her feel her most confident

910
00:42:01,929 --> 00:42:04,231
and shine the brightest on the Runway

911
00:42:04,231 --> 00:42:05,766
and when she's presenting looks.

912
00:42:05,766 --> 00:42:08,902
The whole Runway package of the whole night was

913
00:42:08,902 --> 00:42:09,870
very strong.

914
00:42:09,870 --> 00:42:11,438
Even though she may lack

915
00:42:11,438 --> 00:42:11,471
very strong.

916
00:42:11,471 --> 00:42:13,507
compared to the other girls in performance,

917
00:42:13,507 --> 00:42:15,242
she makes up in fashion.

918
00:42:15,242 --> 00:42:18,078
I enjoyed her talent show as well.

919
00:42:18,312 --> 00:42:21,949
I love that she puts a lot of like storytelling and

920
00:42:21,949 --> 00:42:24,785
and her culture and tradition behind it because,

921
00:42:24,785 --> 00:42:28,088
traditional and cultural performances

922
00:42:28,088 --> 00:42:30,857
- should also be considered as talent, you know?
- Yes, of course.

923
00:42:30,891 --> 00:42:34,795
However, I wish there was a little bit more to it

924
00:42:34,828 --> 00:42:37,431
but all in all, it was a very, very

925
00:42:37,464 --> 00:42:39,666
- heartwarming performance from Suki.
- Yes.

926
00:42:39,666 --> 00:42:41,702
And lastly, Viñas DeLuxe.

927
00:42:41,735 --> 00:42:42,736
Marina?

928
00:42:42,736 --> 00:42:45,505
Viñas DeLuxe is camp.

929
00:42:45,539 --> 00:42:47,040
- Yeah.
- Across the board.

930
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:50,644
Especially her Yellow, Yellow, Yellow Runway,

931
00:42:50,644 --> 00:42:53,447
I think that was one of the best on that category.

932
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:55,882
The performance is what she always

933
00:42:55,916 --> 00:42:58,418
brings to the Runway, even though it's just a Runway.

934
00:42:58,418 --> 00:43:00,020
There's always a story behind it.

935
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:02,956
There's always a there performance behind it.

936
00:43:03,156 --> 00:43:05,525
On the performance aspect, she is very strong.

937
00:43:05,525 --> 00:43:08,228
She knows every single corner of the stage, she started

938
00:43:08,261 --> 00:43:09,563
on her own,

939
00:43:09,563 --> 00:43:12,733
delivered the same amount of energy with her dancers.

940
00:43:12,733 --> 00:43:16,370
And overall it's a very, very strong performance for Viñas DeLuxe.

941
00:43:16,403 --> 00:43:19,940
We can see how tenured she is when it comes to performing.

942
00:43:20,607 --> 00:43:23,276
Viñas DeLuxe is just so funny.

943
00:43:23,276 --> 00:43:25,746
I love her comedy, her physical comedy and

944
00:43:25,779 --> 00:43:27,381
everything that she presented,

945
00:43:27,381 --> 00:43:28,382
where she was a cockroach,

946
00:43:28,382 --> 00:43:29,883
and the Yellow, Yellow, Yellow.

947
00:43:29,883 --> 00:43:33,086
I was so gagged with the invisible head.

948
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:35,055
Overall, the performance was really solid,

949
00:43:35,088 --> 00:43:38,025
was really polished, and was just beautiful to watch.

950
00:43:38,191 --> 00:43:43,230
And now, Queens, let's call back our Top 4 Slaysians.

951
00:43:43,230 --> 00:43:44,364
Let's go.

952
00:43:48,335 --> 00:43:49,903
Queens.

953
00:43:49,903 --> 00:43:53,473
It's time to take a trip down memory lane.

954
00:43:53,707 --> 00:43:56,977
We've got some adorable baby photos of you all.

955
00:43:57,110 --> 00:43:59,646
Let's see what you look like, before you became

956
00:43:59,646 --> 00:44:02,649
the fabulous queens we know and love today.

957
00:44:06,286 --> 00:44:08,288
Arizona Brandy.

958
00:44:08,555 --> 00:44:11,324
What would you like to tell Esis?

959
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:14,761
I just want to say to Esis that

960
00:44:14,795 --> 00:44:16,797
he should be strong.

961
00:44:16,963 --> 00:44:20,801
He's going to face a lot of challenges, a lot,

962
00:44:20,901 --> 00:44:24,104
but his time will come.

963
00:44:24,171 --> 00:44:27,274
Cherish all the moments with your loved ones.

964
00:44:27,340 --> 00:44:30,177
You're not going to have enough with some of them.

965
00:44:30,210 --> 00:44:33,280
If Esis can watch right now,

966
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:35,282
this is gonna be you!

967
00:44:35,916 --> 00:44:40,387
Yeah, just hold on because,

968
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:41,822
you're going to be through a lot,

969
00:44:41,822 --> 00:44:45,859
but you're going to be standing so proud.

970
00:44:45,959 --> 00:44:49,196
You're going to know that everything has a reason.

971
00:44:49,262 --> 00:44:51,732
Everything will make sense.

972
00:44:51,798 --> 00:44:55,202
All the hardships that you will go through,

973
00:44:55,202 --> 00:44:57,404
it will all make sense later.

974
00:44:58,271 --> 00:45:00,507
I love you, Esis. Oh, my God.

975
00:45:01,141 --> 00:45:03,543
- Thank you, Arizona Brandy.
- Thank you.

976
00:45:04,478 --> 00:45:05,412
Whoops!

977
00:45:07,347 --> 00:45:09,182
So handsome!

978
00:45:09,182 --> 00:45:09,983
Brigiding.

979
00:45:10,016 --> 00:45:13,053
- So young yet already so much attitude.
- Brigs.

980
00:45:13,153 --> 00:45:15,455
Hello, hi, Brigs.

981
00:45:15,956 --> 00:45:17,791
You are loved.

982
00:45:18,191 --> 00:45:20,794
You will grow up with a very traumatic childhood,

983
00:45:20,794 --> 00:45:23,130
but your parents will love you.

984
00:45:23,430 --> 00:45:25,899
Your father and your mother will accept you and

985
00:45:25,899 --> 00:45:27,267
you will make them proud.

986
00:45:27,267 --> 00:45:31,037
But by making them proud, you will think that

987
00:45:31,204 --> 00:45:33,306
you can do anything, but you will fail.

988
00:45:33,306 --> 00:45:35,408
You will also lose.

989
00:45:35,876 --> 00:45:38,178
Doors will be closed for you, but

990
00:45:38,245 --> 00:45:41,782
you will learn and you will figure things out.

991
00:45:41,848 --> 00:45:43,316
There are many who love you

992
00:45:43,316 --> 00:45:45,152
because you are beautiful,

993
00:45:45,152 --> 00:45:46,586
because you are kind,

994
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:47,921
and because you're amazing.

995
00:45:47,921 --> 00:45:49,089
I love you, Brigs.

996
00:45:49,122 --> 00:45:50,690
I'm proud of you.

997
00:45:51,658 --> 00:45:53,293
Thank you, Brigiding.

998
00:45:54,661 --> 00:45:56,129
Let's see.

999
00:45:58,632 --> 00:46:00,801
What can you say to Andre?

1000
00:46:00,801 --> 00:46:02,669
Hello, Andre. I love you.

1001
00:46:02,669 --> 00:46:05,005
You will always have a place in my heart.

1002
00:46:05,005 --> 00:46:07,574
You're going to grow into an amazing person.

1003
00:46:07,574 --> 00:46:08,975
You're going to grow into the adult

1004
00:46:08,975 --> 00:46:10,410
that you wish you had in your life

1005
00:46:10,443 --> 00:46:13,113
that guides you in the other places your mother can't.

1006
00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:14,881
You are amazing.

1007
00:46:14,881 --> 00:46:17,517
You're going to become an icon to a lot of people

1008
00:46:17,517 --> 00:46:19,619
who will look up to you.

1009
00:46:19,653 --> 00:46:22,222
There's going to be moments that are going to be very, very dark

1010
00:46:22,222 --> 00:46:25,525
but take the courage to believe in yourself

1011
00:46:25,559 --> 00:46:27,060
and you're more than good enough.

1012
00:46:27,060 --> 00:46:28,728
You're more than

1013
00:46:28,728 --> 00:46:30,564
loved, you are respected.

1014
00:46:30,597 --> 00:46:32,132
You have a place in this world,

1015
00:46:32,165 --> 00:46:34,201
and you never should doubt that ever

1016
00:46:34,201 --> 00:46:36,102
for any second, from anybody,

1017
00:46:36,102 --> 00:46:37,771
no matter what you go through.

1018
00:46:38,905 --> 00:46:45,078
Remember, Mom loves you, and she loves you the most.

1019
00:46:45,912 --> 00:46:47,914
So just remember that

1020
00:46:47,948 --> 00:46:50,417
your mom will always be there for you.

1021
00:46:50,450 --> 00:46:53,520
And you'll be the one that's going to be there for yourself.

1022
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:55,121
You'll grow into that adult and

1023
00:46:55,121 --> 00:46:58,091
be so proud and step foot into the world

1024
00:46:58,091 --> 00:46:59,860
like no one has done before, because

1025
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:01,628
you are unique in your own way.

1026
00:47:01,661 --> 00:47:04,564
And it's okay if people don't understand you or your language.

1027
00:47:04,564 --> 00:47:05,665
I love you.

1028
00:47:06,366 --> 00:47:07,400
Oh, she's...

1029
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:09,102
She's already sewing!

1030
00:47:09,102 --> 00:47:10,337
- Yeah.
- Already!

1031
00:47:10,337 --> 00:47:11,872
They put me early. Look at this.

1032
00:47:11,872 --> 00:47:12,873
A designer.

1033
00:47:15,008 --> 00:47:17,177
And lastly,

1034
00:47:20,981 --> 00:47:22,549
Oh, my God.

1035
00:47:22,549 --> 00:47:24,684
What would you like to tell Lawlaw (means Saggy)?

1036
00:47:27,187 --> 00:47:30,624
They call you Saggy because of your lips, and

1037
00:47:30,624 --> 00:47:33,260
they tease you, they laugh at you, but

1038
00:47:33,260 --> 00:47:35,662
you will be proud of it, someday.

1039
00:47:35,662 --> 00:47:38,732
Just continue curling threads,

1040
00:47:38,732 --> 00:47:41,167
because you're not allowed to touch hair.

1041
00:47:41,167 --> 00:47:46,907
Continue to wear those towels in your room

1042
00:47:46,907 --> 00:47:50,844
because one day, the world will see you wearing that towel.

1043
00:47:50,877 --> 00:47:52,646
And continue to sing

1044
00:47:52,646 --> 00:47:54,214
even if you have to sing to pillows

1045
00:47:54,214 --> 00:47:57,350
so people don't hear how high your voice is.

1046
00:47:57,350 --> 00:47:59,052
Because someday,

1047
00:47:59,085 --> 00:48:01,688
it will bring you to places you deserve,

1048
00:48:01,688 --> 00:48:03,323
places you are appreciated.

1049
00:48:03,323 --> 00:48:05,592
And you will become a good person because of that.

1050
00:48:05,592 --> 00:48:08,428
You will still love your parents, they just weren't aware

1051
00:48:08,428 --> 00:48:11,164
of all the things you could do.

1052
00:48:11,398 --> 00:48:13,733
And... I love you.

1053
00:48:15,802 --> 00:48:16,469
That's all.

1054
00:48:16,469 --> 00:48:18,672
Thank you, Queens.

1055
00:48:24,711 --> 00:48:28,214
Now, based on your Grand Finale Runway looks,

1056
00:48:28,214 --> 00:48:32,385
and Totally Impressive Talent Extravaganza,

1057
00:48:33,253 --> 00:48:35,388
I have made my decision.

1058
00:48:38,992 --> 00:48:41,027
From the Top 4,

1059
00:48:41,161 --> 00:48:45,699
we will now unveil our Top 2.

1060
00:48:46,599 --> 00:48:49,302
Always remember, Queens,

1061
00:48:49,469 --> 00:48:51,604
you are all winners

1062
00:48:51,738 --> 00:48:55,342
and we are very proud of all of you.

1063
00:49:04,851 --> 00:49:06,820
Suki Doll.

1064
00:49:12,325 --> 00:49:14,461
I'm sorry, dear,

1065
00:49:14,494 --> 00:49:17,097
but this is not your time.

1066
00:49:18,498 --> 00:49:22,569
Thank you so much for sharing your beauty and talent with us.

1067
00:49:22,836 --> 00:49:24,070
Thank you, Mama Pao.

1068
00:49:24,204 --> 00:49:25,005
Suki Doll,

1069
00:49:25,038 --> 00:49:28,008
Canada's Asian fashion queen.

1070
00:49:28,241 --> 00:49:30,710
You will always be and forever be

1071
00:49:30,744 --> 00:49:33,146
a Slaysian sensation.

1072
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:35,815
We're so close to the Top 2.

1073
00:49:35,815 --> 00:49:38,118
It feels like I could even touch it.

1074
00:49:38,251 --> 00:49:40,153
I mean, I've worked so hard for it

1075
00:49:40,153 --> 00:49:41,621
and I'm so proud of myself.

1076
00:49:41,654 --> 00:49:43,123
There's nothing that I can say

1077
00:49:43,123 --> 00:49:44,024
that I have not done.

1078
00:49:44,024 --> 00:49:44,657
that I have not done.

1079
00:49:44,657 --> 00:49:46,559
Every stone was turned.

1080
00:49:46,626 --> 00:49:48,128
And everything was pulled.

1081
00:49:48,128 --> 00:49:49,796
Every trick was shown.

1082
00:49:49,829 --> 00:49:51,631
I'm very happy with myself.

1083
00:49:51,698 --> 00:49:52,732
We are privileged

1084
00:49:52,766 --> 00:49:54,834
to even be able to put on a wig

1085
00:49:54,868 --> 00:49:56,369
and do what we do today

1086
00:49:56,369 --> 00:49:57,871
while there's so much happening in the world.

1087
00:49:58,571 --> 00:49:59,539
So I take the moment

1088
00:49:59,539 --> 00:50:00,774
to appreciate my privilege

1089
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:02,509
and that we are paid

1090
00:50:02,542 --> 00:50:04,544
and we are able to live our queer lives

1091
00:50:04,644 --> 00:50:05,745
and have our rights

1092
00:50:05,812 --> 00:50:07,747
that is equal here on this stage.

1093
00:50:07,847 --> 00:50:09,716
So to be celebrated on this platform

1094
00:50:09,716 --> 00:50:12,085
with everybody here who's beyond talented

1095
00:50:12,118 --> 00:50:13,119
I am

1096
00:50:13,186 --> 00:50:14,587
acknowledging my privilege

1097
00:50:14,654 --> 00:50:16,189
and I just want to thank everybody

1098
00:50:16,189 --> 00:50:17,557
who has been part of this journey

1099
00:50:17,624 --> 00:50:19,459
behind the scenes or in front of the scenes.

1100
00:50:19,492 --> 00:50:20,860
and even during

1101
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:22,028
any of these moments.

1102
00:50:22,095 --> 00:50:23,129
So I thank everybody

1103
00:50:23,196 --> 00:50:24,831
and I am more than

1104
00:50:24,898 --> 00:50:26,900
appreciative of everything that's been going on.

1105
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:28,568
We love you, Suki Doll.

1106
00:50:28,568 --> 00:50:30,270
Sashay away.

1107
00:50:30,537 --> 00:50:32,238
Thank you, Mama Pao. Thank you everyone.

1108
00:50:32,272 --> 00:50:35,008
- Love you, sisters.
- We love you.

1109
00:50:38,678 --> 00:50:39,913
Now, you know I'm busy.

1110
00:50:39,946 --> 00:50:41,915
I don't want to see you in my DMs for outfits.

1111
00:50:43,616 --> 00:50:44,751
That bitch!

1112
00:50:44,784 --> 00:50:46,920
Nymphia will be the first one.

1113
00:50:49,856 --> 00:50:50,790
Now,

1114
00:50:50,824 --> 00:50:53,927
Arizona Brandy.

1115
00:50:55,061 --> 00:50:56,830
This moment is not yet

1116
00:50:56,896 --> 00:51:00,033
written in your stars.

1117
00:51:00,233 --> 00:51:02,502
I'm sorry, my dear.

1118
00:51:02,902 --> 00:51:05,271
We thank you so much for sharing your charisma

1119
00:51:05,271 --> 00:51:07,073
and talent with us.

1120
00:51:09,509 --> 00:51:13,813
Arizona Brandy, the thirst-quenching queen of slay.

1121
00:51:14,614 --> 00:51:18,718
You will always and forever be a Slaysian Sensation.

1122
00:51:18,751 --> 00:51:20,487
It's not going to end here.

1123
00:51:20,553 --> 00:51:21,988
It's just the beginning

1124
00:51:21,988 --> 00:51:24,824
of my love letter to the Filipino drag queens.

1125
00:51:24,858 --> 00:51:27,794
I hope they get inspired when they see me.

1126
00:51:27,827 --> 00:51:32,432
I hope that they know that I am so inspired by them.

1127
00:51:33,199 --> 00:51:36,436
Thank you so much, Drag Race Philippines

1128
00:51:36,536 --> 00:51:39,672
for this once in a lifetime opportunity.

1129
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:44,110
Thank you for giving me the chance to prove myself.

1130
00:51:44,110 --> 00:51:46,946
Thank you for letting me love myself.

1131
00:51:47,247 --> 00:51:49,115
It's not about winning.

1132
00:51:49,282 --> 00:51:50,683
It's about showing up

1133
00:51:50,750 --> 00:51:51,818
and I showed up.

1134
00:51:52,819 --> 00:51:54,420
Thank you, Arizona Brandy.

1135
00:51:54,521 --> 00:51:56,256
Sashay away.

1136
00:51:56,356 --> 00:51:58,191
We're so proud of you.

1137
00:52:05,965 --> 00:52:07,667
Let it be known,

1138
00:52:08,034 --> 00:52:10,236
I did not lose.

1139
00:52:10,436 --> 00:52:11,638
I just didn't win.

1140
00:52:14,174 --> 00:52:17,076
It's the same thing, you stupid bitch!

1141
00:52:18,478 --> 00:52:19,879
That means,

1142
00:52:19,979 --> 00:52:21,548
Brigiding,

1143
00:52:21,748 --> 00:52:24,884
and Viñas DeLuxe, condragulations!

1144
00:52:25,218 --> 00:52:27,187
You're both moving forward to the finals.

1145
00:52:27,187 --> 00:52:30,790
You two will lip sync for the crown.

1146
00:52:31,124 --> 00:52:33,393
Now my Top 2 Slaysian Royale Queens,

1147
00:52:33,426 --> 00:52:34,994
you may now go back to the Werkroom

1148
00:52:35,061 --> 00:52:39,299
to change for your Lip Sync for The Crown looks.

1149
00:52:39,499 --> 00:52:40,867
Please evaporate, disseminate,

1150
00:52:40,934 --> 00:52:42,502
propagate, and inseminate.

1151
00:52:42,535 --> 00:52:46,105
Inseminate?!

1152
00:52:47,173 --> 00:52:49,676
Go, Top 2 Queens!

1153
00:52:52,412 --> 00:52:54,214
Thank you!

1154
00:52:54,247 --> 00:52:55,281
What the fuck!

1155
00:52:58,952 --> 00:53:00,320
And now,

1156
00:53:00,353 --> 00:53:03,590
the moment you've all been waiting for.

1157
00:53:03,923 --> 00:53:05,892
From 12 Queens,

1158
00:53:05,992 --> 00:53:08,127
now we present to you all

1159
00:53:08,161 --> 00:53:11,931
our Top 2 Slaysian Royale Queens!

1160
00:53:12,031 --> 00:53:13,299
Brigiding.

1161
00:53:13,466 --> 00:53:15,835
I am so grateful and happy

1162
00:53:15,868 --> 00:53:17,237
to be sharing this moment

1163
00:53:17,303 --> 00:53:20,607
with my very good sister, Viñas DeLuxe

1164
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:22,242
who's also inspiring,

1165
00:53:22,342 --> 00:53:24,277
who's also loving,

1166
00:53:24,344 --> 00:53:26,412
and honest and true.

1167
00:53:26,479 --> 00:53:29,215
And Viñas DeLuxe.

1168
00:53:29,515 --> 00:53:31,951
I'm so, so, so happy and grateful

1169
00:53:31,951 --> 00:53:34,354
that I get to share the same experience

1170
00:53:34,454 --> 00:53:35,655
with Brigiding.

1171
00:53:35,655 --> 00:53:35,788
from Season 1.

1172
00:53:35,822 --> 00:53:37,490
And now,

1173
00:53:37,557 --> 00:53:39,292
whoever wins this,

1174
00:53:39,325 --> 00:53:41,494
this is both our win.

1175
00:53:41,728 --> 00:53:44,530
Two Queens stand behind me.

1176
00:53:44,797 --> 00:53:46,099
Prior to tonight,

1177
00:53:46,165 --> 00:53:47,934
you were asked to prepare a lip sync

1178
00:53:47,934 --> 00:53:50,203
performance of the song

1179
00:53:50,270 --> 00:53:54,607
“Born to Do Drag” by Marina Summers.

1180
00:53:55,074 --> 00:53:56,042
Ladies,

1181
00:53:56,109 --> 00:53:58,444
this is your last chance to impress me.

1182
00:53:58,511 --> 00:54:00,546
And prove to the world

1183
00:54:00,613 --> 00:54:02,315
that you have what it takes

1184
00:54:02,382 --> 00:54:03,583
to be the first

1185
00:54:03,616 --> 00:54:07,820
Slaysian Royale Drag Superstar!

1186
00:54:08,554 --> 00:54:10,089
Now,

1187
00:54:10,356 --> 00:54:13,226
the time has come

1188
00:54:14,294 --> 00:54:16,829
for you to Lip Sync

1189
00:54:17,096 --> 00:54:21,034
for the Crown!

1190
00:54:25,038 --> 00:54:26,272
In one lip sync,

1191
00:54:26,306 --> 00:54:27,573
my life will be changed

1192
00:54:27,607 --> 00:54:30,510
and I am so sure that

1193
00:54:30,943 --> 00:54:33,313
this fight is not just my fight.

1194
00:54:33,413 --> 00:54:35,348
It's the fight of the many people

1195
00:54:35,348 --> 00:54:38,117
who have lost and failed.

1196
00:54:38,151 --> 00:54:41,321
Maybe I'm just too hard on myself

1197
00:54:41,387 --> 00:54:43,089
but I wasn't expecting to be in the Top 4.

1198
00:54:43,089 --> 00:54:45,291
But now I'm in the Top 2.

1199
00:54:45,358 --> 00:54:47,060
I'm so, so, so happy.

1200
00:54:47,093 --> 00:54:47,827
Thank you.

1201
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:49,329
I'm going to give my all!

1202
00:54:49,329 --> 00:54:51,331
I will fight my way to the Top 1.

1203
00:54:51,397 --> 00:54:52,598
Good luck.

1204
00:54:52,699 --> 00:54:55,268
And don't fuck it up.

1205
00:54:57,003 --> 00:55:01,374
World, it's summertime

1206
00:55:01,674 --> 00:55:04,110
I was born to do drag

1207
00:55:04,143 --> 00:55:05,845
Built like a queen,

1208
00:55:05,845 --> 00:55:07,347
it runs in my veins

1209
00:55:07,347 --> 00:55:10,016
Oh, baby, how can I live without it?

1210
00:55:10,049 --> 00:55:11,517
Born to do drag,

1211
00:55:11,784 --> 00:55:13,886
the world is my stage

1212
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:15,188
Turn on the lights,

1213
00:55:15,188 --> 00:55:17,890
You put the crown on my head, now, baby

1214
00:55:17,957 --> 00:55:21,494
Born to do drag, born to do drag

1215
00:55:21,627 --> 00:55:25,264
Born to do, born to do, born to do drag

1216
00:55:25,298 --> 00:55:29,369
I was born to do drag, born to do drag

1217
00:55:29,702 --> 00:55:33,039
Born to do, born to do, born to do drag

1218
00:55:33,072 --> 00:55:35,708
I was born to do drag

1219
00:55:38,811 --> 00:55:42,749
I set the world for the birth of a star

1220
00:55:42,982 --> 00:55:46,686
Best believe I'm gonna strut it so far (straight to the Runway)

1221
00:55:46,719 --> 00:55:50,590
Born for the game and I do it so right
(tens, tens, tens across the board)

1222
00:55:50,656 --> 00:55:54,460
This little diva has it shining so bright (so bright)

1223
00:55:54,460 --> 00:55:58,398
Oh

1224
00:55:58,698 --> 00:56:02,335
Ain't no way I'm gonna stop 'cause it's where I belong

1225
00:56:02,368 --> 00:56:06,305
Oh

1226
00:56:06,539 --> 00:56:10,676
Gotta show 'em I'm that bitch, time to bring it on

1227
00:56:10,777 --> 00:56:14,714
'Cause I got the fire, that burning desire

1228
00:56:14,714 --> 00:56:18,584
She's taking me higher
(taking it higher)

1229
00:56:18,618 --> 00:56:22,755
And let me remind ya that you can't deny her

1230
00:56:22,822 --> 00:56:24,590
Come through whatever

1231
00:56:24,657 --> 00:56:26,626
I was born to do drag,

1232
00:56:26,759 --> 00:56:28,461
Built like a queen

1233
00:56:28,494 --> 00:56:29,929
It runs in my veins,

1234
00:56:29,929 --> 00:56:32,632
Oh, baby, how can I live without it?

1235
00:56:32,698 --> 00:56:34,367
Born to do drag,

1236
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:36,502
the world is my stage

1237
00:56:36,569 --> 00:56:37,804
Turn on the lights,

1238
00:56:37,804 --> 00:56:40,506
You put the crown on my head, now, baby

1239
00:56:40,540 --> 00:56:44,377
Born to do drag, born to do drag

1240
00:56:44,444 --> 00:56:47,880
Born to do, born to do, born to do drag

1241
00:56:47,914 --> 00:56:52,018
I was born to do drag, born to do drag

1242
00:56:52,285 --> 00:56:55,788
Born to do, born to do, born to do drag

1243
00:56:55,788 --> 00:56:58,257
I was born to do drag

1244
00:56:58,291 --> 00:56:59,559
Hold up, hold up

1245
00:56:59,592 --> 00:57:01,227
Let me tell you something real quick

1246
00:57:01,227 --> 00:57:03,129
Filipino diva with a confession

1247
00:57:03,162 --> 00:57:05,097
Fine, fresh, fierce, shook a whole nation

1248
00:57:05,131 --> 00:57:07,300
Let me take it back, give a standing ovation

1249
00:57:07,333 --> 00:57:09,769
Pull up, start the Filipina invasion

1250
00:57:09,836 --> 00:57:11,737
Three stars and the sun domination

1251
00:57:11,771 --> 00:57:13,739
Feels right like a summer vacation

1252
00:57:13,739 --> 00:57:17,577
Guns up, aim fire, international Marina sensation

1253
00:57:17,643 --> 00:57:21,614
'Cause I got the fire, that burning desire

1254
00:57:21,647 --> 00:57:24,784
She's taking me higher

1255
00:57:25,518 --> 00:57:29,422
And let me remind ya that you can't deny her

1256
00:57:29,489 --> 00:57:31,424
Come through whatever

1257
00:57:31,457 --> 00:57:33,526
I was born to do drag,

1258
00:57:33,659 --> 00:57:35,127
Built like a queen

1259
00:57:35,361 --> 00:57:36,829
It runs in my veins,

1260
00:57:36,829 --> 00:57:39,499
Oh, baby, how can I live without it?

1261
00:57:39,532 --> 00:57:41,267
Born to do drag,

1262
00:57:41,300 --> 00:57:43,402
The world is my stage

1263
00:57:43,436 --> 00:57:44,737
Turn on the lights,

1264
00:57:44,737 --> 00:57:47,440
You put the crown on my head, now, baby

1265
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:51,010
Born to do drag, Born to do drag

1266
00:57:51,244 --> 00:57:54,914
Born to do, born to do, born to do drag

1267
00:57:54,914 --> 00:57:58,885
I was born to do drag, born to do drag

1268
00:57:59,185 --> 00:58:02,722
Born to do, born to do, born to do drag

1269
00:58:02,722 --> 00:58:04,724
I was born to do drag

1270
00:58:04,724 --> 00:58:06,792
You're a winner, baby

1271
00:58:13,232 --> 00:58:14,700
Before we announce the winner,

1272
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:17,403
we have a very special announcement.

1273
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:23,543
She done already done had herses.

1274
00:58:23,843 --> 00:58:26,045
Mabuheeey, Queens!

1275
00:58:26,245 --> 00:58:30,716
Condragulations for making it to the grand finale.

1276
00:58:30,850 --> 00:58:32,218
You turned looks,

1277
00:58:32,251 --> 00:58:33,519
snatched wigs,

1278
00:58:33,586 --> 00:58:35,421
and shut it down.

1279
00:58:35,621 --> 00:58:37,990
But the question remains.

1280
00:58:38,024 --> 00:58:40,826
Who will claim the crown?

1281
00:58:41,227 --> 00:58:42,395
The time has come

1282
00:58:42,428 --> 00:58:43,763
to show the world

1283
00:58:43,796 --> 00:58:46,866
which Queen will reign supreme

1284
00:58:47,199 --> 00:58:50,903
as the winner of Slaysian Royale

1285
00:58:51,070 --> 00:58:53,673

00:58:57,076 --> 00:58:58,444
Thank you, Mama Ru.

who crafted my fabulous, Slaysian Royale-worthy looks.

Each stitch, sparkle, and silhouette

1296
00:59:22,168 --> 00:59:23,703
was a work of art.

1297
00:59:23,769 --> 00:59:25,938

Yes! Crown it!

1350
01:01:38,003 --> 01:01:40,272
I can't believe it.

1351
01:01:40,339 --> 01:01:42,141
So it's true.

1352
01:01:42,208 --> 01:01:43,876
All the things I said

1353
01:01:43,876 --> 01:01:45,678
to myself was true.

1354
01:01:45,678 --> 01:01:47,880
I actually did it.

1355
01:01:47,947 --> 01:01:48,881
Like

1356
01:01:49,014 --> 01:01:51,817
these are the same emotions when I said

1357
01:01:51,851 --> 01:01:54,086
on Season 1,

1358
01:01:54,186 --> 01:01:57,389
thank you Drag Race Philippines, and I'm excited to

1359
01:01:57,423 --> 01:02:00,726
explore myself and understand myself better.

1360
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:03,629
Now Brigiding, what would you like to say to the Philippines,

1361
01:02:03,629 --> 01:02:06,499
and to the rest of Asia, and the world?

1362
01:02:06,632 --> 01:02:09,068
Mama Pao this is the testament

1363
01:02:09,235 --> 01:02:11,303
that learning is the new winning.

1364
01:02:11,303 --> 01:02:13,272
So please, please don't be afraid

1365
01:02:13,272 --> 01:02:15,007
to share your story.

1366
01:02:15,074 --> 01:02:17,076
And do not give up on your dreams

1367
01:02:17,076 --> 01:02:20,045
because dreams don't expire, Mama Pao.

1368
01:02:20,045 --> 01:02:22,348
Thank you so much!

1369
01:02:22,381 --> 01:02:23,649
Condragulations, Brigiding!

1370
01:02:23,649 --> 01:02:24,950
Now prance my Queen.

01:02:30,589 --> 01:02:32,691

01:02:44,737 --> 01:02:46,939
The Runiverse has its own way

1377
01:02:46,939 --> 01:02:50,543
of Rudirecting you to where you deserve.

1378

You all made your mothers proud!

That is why your mothers are queens!

1387
01:03:04,790 --> 01:03:07,827
Your mother is a queen too!

1388
01:03:07,827 --> 01:03:08,894

All heart, always and in all ways.
