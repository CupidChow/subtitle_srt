00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:04,023
Previously, on Drag Race Philippines: Slaysian Royale.

2
00:00:04,023 --> 00:00:05,858
So for this week's Maxi Challenge,

3
00:00:05,891 --> 00:00:07,893
Let's welcome our balikbayans!
(Overseas Filipinos coming home)

4
00:00:07,893 --> 00:00:11,063
Transforming them as part of your drag family.

5
00:00:11,063 --> 00:00:11,964
Makeover!

6
00:00:11,964 --> 00:00:13,365
I am pretty good at, you know,

7
00:00:13,365 --> 00:00:15,000
doing aesthetics and styling people,

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,569
so I want to see what I can pull off.

9
00:00:16,569 --> 00:00:19,205
Khianna, in addition to your winning advantage,

10
00:00:19,205 --> 00:00:20,706
you have the power to switch

11
00:00:20,706 --> 00:00:21,874
things up, literally.

12
00:00:21,874 --> 00:00:23,242
You have to choose a queen

13
00:00:23,242 --> 00:00:24,343
from a different pair

14
00:00:24,376 --> 00:00:26,212
to switch with another group.

15
00:00:26,312 --> 00:00:28,481
You know, for more drama.

16
00:00:28,614 --> 00:00:30,549
I wanna take sister V,

17
00:00:30,549 --> 00:00:31,550
as my partner

18
00:00:31,584 --> 00:00:34,120
and Siam to go to Yuhua.

19
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:36,956
Khianna, you shady ass bitch.

20
00:00:36,956 --> 00:00:38,924
Brigiding and Suki Doll with

21
00:00:38,924 --> 00:00:40,793
Bevalicious D!

22
00:00:40,793 --> 00:00:42,294
from head to toe,

23
00:00:42,294 --> 00:00:43,762
this was a finished look.

24
00:00:43,762 --> 00:00:45,898
Arizona Brandy and Bernie with

25
00:00:45,898 --> 00:00:46,932
Hermhie!

26
00:00:46,932 --> 00:00:48,601
I do believe in the saying that

27
00:00:48,634 --> 00:00:50,636
if you don't have anything good to say,

28
00:00:50,669 --> 00:00:52,004
just shut the fuck up.

29
00:00:52,037 --> 00:00:52,705
Oh, my God.
Brigiding.

30
00:00:53,372 --> 00:00:54,473
Suki Doll.

31
00:00:54,473 --> 00:00:56,008
Condragulations!

32
00:00:56,008 --> 00:00:57,309
You are the winning group

33
00:00:57,543 --> 00:00:59,879
of this week's challenge.

34
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:00,679
This means,

35
00:01:00,679 --> 00:01:02,181
I'm sorry, Bernie

36
00:01:02,181 --> 00:01:03,582
and Arizona Brandy.

37
00:01:03,582 --> 00:01:05,451
You are the Bottom 2 queens

38
00:01:05,451 --> 00:01:06,185
of the week.

39
00:01:06,185 --> 00:01:08,220
The time has come

40
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:09,488
for you to lip sync

41
00:01:09,488 --> 00:01:12,391
for your legacy!

42
00:01:12,391 --> 00:01:13,192
Brigiding.

43
00:01:13,192 --> 00:01:14,326
You are a slayer, baby.

44
00:01:14,326 --> 00:01:15,494
Condragulations!

45
00:01:15,828 --> 00:01:17,930
You will always be a star, Sis.

46
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:19,198
Bernie.

47
00:01:19,565 --> 00:01:20,232
Bernie.

48
00:01:20,232 --> 00:01:21,667
As it is written,

49
00:01:21,667 --> 00:01:23,269
so it shall be done.

50
00:01:23,269 --> 00:01:25,337
Now, sashay away.

51
00:01:30,442 --> 00:01:32,111
You...

52
00:01:33,412 --> 00:01:34,880
Enter, Mariah.

53
00:01:37,883 --> 00:01:38,717
Finally!

54
00:01:38,751 --> 00:01:41,921
For the last five weeks, I've been in the top.

55
00:01:41,921 --> 00:01:44,523
It's a great feeling, knowing you did your best.

56
00:01:44,557 --> 00:01:45,991
But unfortunately,

57
00:01:46,025 --> 00:01:49,595
I have to send one of my sisters to go home, which is Bernie.

58
00:01:49,995 --> 00:01:51,330
I love you all.

59
00:01:51,363 --> 00:01:53,933
See you, bitches.

60
00:01:54,266 --> 00:01:55,501
We love you, Bernie!

61
00:01:55,734 --> 00:01:59,205
We love you, Bernie!

62
00:01:59,438 --> 00:02:00,673
It's sad because

63
00:02:00,673 --> 00:02:03,943
there's a Filipina queen going home and

64
00:02:03,976 --> 00:02:06,845
another Filipina queen also eliminated her.

65
00:02:06,845 --> 00:02:09,782
So, things are getting serious up in here.

66
00:02:09,815 --> 00:02:10,983
For the first time ever,

67
00:02:10,983 --> 00:02:13,285
a Pinay queen leaves the competition.

68
00:02:13,352 --> 00:02:15,888
All the Pinay queens are shook.

69
00:02:15,988 --> 00:02:17,957
Because girl, it could be you too.

70
00:02:18,324 --> 00:02:18,991
Bye, Bernie.

71
00:02:18,991 --> 00:02:19,992
We love you.

72
00:02:20,025 --> 00:02:22,027
How do you feel, Arizona?

73
00:02:22,294 --> 00:02:25,064
You seem very wrecked.

74
00:02:27,366 --> 00:02:28,968
I want Bernie to stay.

75
00:02:29,301 --> 00:02:30,769
The one who really had my back is gone.

76
00:02:31,036 --> 00:02:32,438
That's how I feel.

77
00:02:32,571 --> 00:02:33,973
Me and Bernie

78
00:02:34,206 --> 00:02:35,774
have been really close

79
00:02:35,808 --> 00:02:37,543
after the competition and

80
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:41,513
It's all flashing back to me how we

81
00:02:41,513 --> 00:02:44,583
manifested everything together.

82
00:02:45,618 --> 00:02:46,785
Someone's got to go.

83
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:48,320
Someone’s got to go.

84
00:02:48,787 --> 00:02:50,122
It hurts me that

85
00:02:50,422 --> 00:02:53,425
I get to be here and then in return she has to leave.

86
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:56,128
I don't want to waste Bernie's spot.

87
00:02:56,161 --> 00:02:57,229
I don't want to waste

88
00:02:57,263 --> 00:02:59,999
the opportunity that Bernie has to be eliminated

89
00:02:59,999 --> 00:03:01,600
just so I could stay.

90
00:03:01,634 --> 00:03:04,403
So Suki, whose lipstick did you choose?

91
00:03:04,403 --> 00:03:06,372
I respect really much

92
00:03:06,372 --> 00:03:07,573
the score sheet,

93
00:03:07,573 --> 00:03:09,074
that myself did.

94
00:03:09,141 --> 00:03:12,244
So, obviously I went with my principles and values

95
00:03:12,244 --> 00:03:14,613
and I would never go against my values.

96
00:03:14,613 --> 00:03:16,048
So, I chose Bernie.

97
00:03:16,749 --> 00:03:18,651
Track record is a good guide.

98
00:03:18,784 --> 00:03:20,452
But I think what's more important is,

99
00:03:20,452 --> 00:03:22,254
it really depends on who you are.

100
00:03:22,288 --> 00:03:24,757
If I had power, I would like to do the opposite way.

101
00:03:24,757 --> 00:03:27,926
I would love to give another chance to Bernie.

102
00:03:28,327 --> 00:03:31,363
- And congrats, Brigiding!
- Congratulations, Brigiding!

103
00:03:31,363 --> 00:03:33,098
I'm so happy that

104
00:03:33,132 --> 00:03:34,733
track record wise,

105
00:03:34,733 --> 00:03:38,604
Viñas, Khianna, me, in the tops, Arizona,

106
00:03:38,871 --> 00:03:40,105
have been slaying.

107
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:42,074
So, I’m really looking forward to seeing

108
00:03:42,074 --> 00:03:43,709
Siam, Yuhua...

109
00:03:43,742 --> 00:03:44,576
in the next weeks,

110
00:03:44,576 --> 00:03:47,413
to be proving themselves more.

111
00:03:47,613 --> 00:03:48,480
Bitch,

112
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,748
for the next week,

113
00:03:49,748 --> 00:03:52,084
I better fucking slay, girl.

114
00:03:52,284 --> 00:03:54,286
Because if I don't get a win next week...

115
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,587
Girl.

116
00:03:55,654 --> 00:03:56,955
Then this crown ain't for me, girl.

117
00:03:57,022 --> 00:03:59,158
And I'm sure the next challenges

118
00:03:59,158 --> 00:04:00,426
in the next weeks, will be

119
00:04:00,426 --> 00:04:02,761
tougher and harder for everyone.

120
00:04:02,761 --> 00:04:04,163
- As it should be.
- For everyone.

121
00:04:04,163 --> 00:04:04,830
Let's do it!

122
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:06,031
- Siam, you ready?
- Let's de-drag.

123
00:04:06,065 --> 00:04:08,500
- Ready, yes.
- Let's prove these bitches wrong.

124
00:04:09,835 --> 00:04:12,471
It's time for me to show what I have.

125
00:04:12,504 --> 00:04:15,207
And everything I will do to get the crown.

126
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:18,377
I just want to get out of that safe zone.

127
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:19,812
Girl, I want to be on top.

128
00:04:19,845 --> 00:04:24,016
Bring back my...

129
00:04:25,117 --> 00:04:27,052
Bitch, you sound like you're getting choked.

130
00:04:27,286 --> 00:04:29,355
Girl, my rank keeps dropping. I'm always safe.

131
00:04:29,388 --> 00:04:31,357
I want my track record to go up.

132
00:04:39,965 --> 00:04:41,100
Go ahead and tire yourself out.

133
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:41,500
Keep going.

134
00:04:44,837 --> 00:04:47,639
The winner of Drag Race Philippines: Slaysian Royale

135
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:48,941
will receive a one-year supply of

136
00:04:48,941 --> 00:04:50,743
Anastasia Beverly Hills Cosmetics.

137
00:04:50,776 --> 00:04:54,213
A coveted spot on the Drag Race Slaysian Hall of Fame.

138
00:04:54,246 --> 00:04:55,547
And a cash prize of

139
00:04:55,547 --> 00:04:56,782
2 Million Pesos!

140
00:04:56,782 --> 00:04:58,550
Powered by Bingo Plus.

141
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:00,953
Tonight with our extra special guest judges,

142
00:05:00,986 --> 00:05:02,154
Captivating Katkat

143
00:05:02,154 --> 00:05:04,123
and Alyssa Edwards.

144
00:05:12,865 --> 00:05:15,667
Hello, hello...

145
00:05:15,667 --> 00:05:18,203
Energy!

146
00:05:18,203 --> 00:05:20,906
It's a brand new day!

147
00:05:20,939 --> 00:05:23,008
It's a new day in the Werkroom and obviously

148
00:05:23,008 --> 00:05:23,842
I wasn't the top

149
00:05:23,842 --> 00:05:25,644
so we have to do even better.

150
00:05:26,111 --> 00:05:30,449
Oh, my God, Top 7 and I'm still in the competition.

151
00:05:30,449 --> 00:05:33,285
Three international queens and four Pinay queens.

152
00:05:33,852 --> 00:05:36,288
This could be anybody's game.

153
00:05:36,321 --> 00:05:37,589
I want to give props

154
00:05:37,589 --> 00:05:40,893
and share this RuBadge to my sister here,

155
00:05:40,893 --> 00:05:42,528
- Thank you.
- Suki Doll.

156
00:05:42,528 --> 00:05:45,864
- Because I wouldn't have gotten this RuBadge...
- Did you thank her in the room after?

157
00:05:47,299 --> 00:05:49,301
- I wouldn't have gotten this RuBadge
- We've gotten closer.

158
00:05:49,301 --> 00:05:50,869
if it wasn't for her help.

159
00:05:50,869 --> 00:05:52,004
How about you, girl?

160
00:05:52,004 --> 00:05:53,305
I think it’s the same as mine.

161
00:05:53,305 --> 00:05:55,073
Because it’s my first time learning

162
00:05:55,107 --> 00:05:56,875
the kind of makeup that you do.

163
00:05:57,109 --> 00:05:57,676
For me,

164
00:05:57,676 --> 00:05:59,011
working with Yuhua is like

165
00:05:59,011 --> 00:06:01,046
a good learning experience to me.

166
00:06:01,413 --> 00:06:03,749
I feel like after that I got

167
00:06:03,782 --> 00:06:05,117
a lot of energy from her.

168
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:07,386
Shout out those outfits that we wore.

169
00:06:07,419 --> 00:06:09,955
From the top, and all those pieces that hang from the bottom

170
00:06:10,189 --> 00:06:12,491
were from her family passed down from generations.

171
00:06:12,891 --> 00:06:14,560
And we believe that

172
00:06:14,593 --> 00:06:15,828
when we wear something,

173
00:06:16,094 --> 00:06:19,531
you will feel the spirits of those people who used to wear them.

174
00:06:19,531 --> 00:06:22,367
Siam and I are just appreciating each other's culture,

175
00:06:22,367 --> 00:06:24,470
of how both of those cultures blended

176
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:25,737
together beautifully.

177
00:06:25,737 --> 00:06:27,272
What are your game plans?

178
00:06:27,272 --> 00:06:28,240
Do you have any?

179
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:29,975
I want

180
00:06:29,975 --> 00:06:30,909
to do better,

181
00:06:30,909 --> 00:06:32,845
not only just for myself, because coming here,

182
00:06:32,845 --> 00:06:35,147
not only do I want to show my drag to the world,

183
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:36,615
that there are different ways to do drag,

184
00:06:36,615 --> 00:06:38,550
but also a learning experience.

185
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:40,786
So, I'm learning so much but at the same time,

186
00:06:40,786 --> 00:06:41,887
I want to do better

187
00:06:41,887 --> 00:06:43,989
and I want to be the best version of myself.

188
00:06:44,189 --> 00:06:45,657
And I want that fucking crown.

189
00:06:45,657 --> 00:06:47,159
What about you, Siam?

190
00:06:47,226 --> 00:06:49,194
I'm going to clear the energy.

191
00:06:49,595 --> 00:06:50,929
Energy around me.

192
00:06:50,963 --> 00:06:52,431
And I feel like last week,

193
00:06:52,464 --> 00:06:54,933
I kind of cleared all the bad energy out

194
00:06:54,967 --> 00:06:58,070
and now I'm ready for the new Siam to arrive again.

195
00:06:58,337 --> 00:06:59,972
Oh!

196
00:06:59,972 --> 00:07:01,740
- Siam 3.0!
- Feisty!

197
00:07:01,773 --> 00:07:02,975
If you do not believe in yourself,

198
00:07:03,008 --> 00:07:04,510
who the hell is going to believe in you?

199
00:07:04,943 --> 00:07:05,511
Right?

200
00:07:05,511 --> 00:07:07,613
I'm going to stand up for myself,

201
00:07:07,613 --> 00:07:09,815
- And I'm getting that crown.
- Well, I'm standing up for myself.

202
00:07:09,982 --> 00:07:11,416
I believe I can do it.

203
00:07:11,416 --> 00:07:12,651
No matter what happens,

204
00:07:12,651 --> 00:07:14,319
I will do what it takes, until I die.

205
00:07:14,353 --> 00:07:16,755
And then if I die, I will do it again

206
00:07:16,755 --> 00:07:18,357
and again to get this crown!

207
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,762
Siam is going off.

208
00:07:23,762 --> 00:07:26,131
And I don't know in which planet

209
00:07:26,164 --> 00:07:27,633
but she is going off.

210
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:29,067
Are you ready for me?

211
00:07:29,134 --> 00:07:31,436
Because I'm so ready, girl!

212
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:38,210
Her speech was definitely something.

213
00:07:39,077 --> 00:07:42,314
Because I'm willing to do anything because I want to be the crown!

214
00:07:42,648 --> 00:07:44,349
This is Siam Phusri.

215
00:07:44,349 --> 00:07:46,018
I'm ready to win!

216
00:07:47,886 --> 00:07:48,987
This is me!

217
00:07:49,821 --> 00:07:50,889
New me!

218
00:07:51,189 --> 00:07:53,225
I'm happy to be the new me!

219
00:07:55,994 --> 00:07:57,129
I love it!

220
00:07:57,963 --> 00:07:58,864
Love it!

221
00:07:59,131 --> 00:07:59,865
Love it!

222
00:08:00,899 --> 00:08:02,134
You ready for me?!

223
00:08:02,467 --> 00:08:04,202
Is this what you wanted to see from me?

224
00:08:04,803 --> 00:08:06,138
And I like it.

225
00:08:06,505 --> 00:08:07,906
Thank you for all the beautiful and

226
00:08:07,906 --> 00:08:09,808
everything and all the funny energy from you.

227
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:13,011
I received everything in me.

228
00:08:14,446 --> 00:08:15,480
So happy.

229
00:08:16,448 --> 00:08:18,250
Siam Phusri just arrived.

230
00:08:20,152 --> 00:08:21,753
Is what just happened for real?

231
00:08:21,753 --> 00:08:22,955
I was waiting for her to say

232
00:08:22,988 --> 00:08:23,789
"I'm just kidding, babes"

233
00:08:23,822 --> 00:08:25,724
I was waiting for her to say that or whatever,

234
00:08:25,724 --> 00:08:26,758
but she said nothing after.

235
00:08:26,758 --> 00:08:29,161
I got scared, babes.

236
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:32,531
Enough, Sis.

237
00:08:32,698 --> 00:08:35,200
At first, I thought she was just being funny, right?

238
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,401
But then,

239
00:08:36,401 --> 00:08:37,502
I got scared.

240
00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:39,004
Wow.

241
00:08:39,037 --> 00:08:41,440
- That was scary.
- A round of applause for...

242
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,977
Siam!

243
00:08:46,078 --> 00:08:47,512
The shaking of like,

244
00:08:47,512 --> 00:08:49,915
the lips and the eyes?

245
00:08:49,915 --> 00:08:52,050
After this, I'm having nightmares.

246
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:52,618
Is that...

247
00:08:52,618 --> 00:08:53,752
Is that acting?

248
00:08:53,752 --> 00:08:55,287
Or is that like a real thing?

249
00:08:55,287 --> 00:08:57,656
- I’m like... I got scared.
- Okay.

250
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:00,425
I got scared because

251
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:02,961
I felt as if something

252
00:09:02,995 --> 00:09:04,763
like a dark energy

253
00:09:04,763 --> 00:09:07,132
came over her during that time.

254
00:09:07,132 --> 00:09:10,335
And I have no idea what that was, but

255
00:09:10,402 --> 00:09:12,004
I've seen that before.

256
00:09:13,438 --> 00:09:14,906
Ooh, girl!

257
00:09:14,906 --> 00:09:18,110
- Oh, my God!
- She done already done had herses.

258
00:09:18,543 --> 00:09:20,445
Hello, hello, hello!

259
00:09:20,579 --> 00:09:21,380
Queens.

260
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:22,981
It's campaign season.

261
00:09:22,981 --> 00:09:25,317
Will you snatch the popular vote

262
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:27,419
or get lost on the ballot?

263
00:09:27,419 --> 00:09:28,587
Only time will tell.

264
00:09:28,587 --> 00:09:31,023
So be the baddest bitch in the game,

265
00:09:31,023 --> 00:09:31,890
or...

266
00:09:31,923 --> 00:09:33,692
snap out of it!

267
00:09:33,792 --> 00:09:36,428
Oh, my goodness!

268
00:09:36,428 --> 00:09:37,896
It's a snapping competition.

269
00:09:37,929 --> 00:09:40,565
Haller, haller, haller!

270
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:42,834
Mama Pao!

271
00:09:42,868 --> 00:09:44,569
Mama Pao!

272
00:09:44,603 --> 00:09:46,471
Mama Pao!

273
00:09:46,505 --> 00:09:49,975
Mabuheeey, my dazzling delegates of drag.

274
00:09:49,975 --> 00:09:52,678
If there's one thing we, Asians, have perfected

275
00:09:52,678 --> 00:09:55,847
it's making serious noise and leaving a mark.

276
00:09:55,847 --> 00:09:57,282
From Manila's People Power

277
00:09:57,282 --> 00:09:59,618
to Bangkok's electrifying protests,

278
00:09:59,618 --> 00:10:01,753
all the way to K-pop stans

279
00:10:01,753 --> 00:10:04,890
dominating the digital sphere.

280
00:10:04,923 --> 00:10:07,826
Digital SPHERES?!

281
00:10:08,226 --> 00:10:11,596
Asian voices are loud, proud, and unstoppable.

282
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:14,566
And in the spirit of making our voices heard,

283
00:10:14,599 --> 00:10:16,001
today's Mini Challenge is all about

284
00:10:16,001 --> 00:10:17,436
casting our votes,

285
00:10:18,503 --> 00:10:20,072
making strategic choices,

286
00:10:20,205 --> 00:10:22,040
and stirring the pot just a little bit.

287
00:10:22,074 --> 00:10:22,908
Oh, my God!

288
00:10:22,941 --> 00:10:24,376
It's time for you to...

289
00:10:24,376 --> 00:10:28,480
- Rate-A-Queen!
- Oh, my God!

290
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:29,981
Let's do it, baby!

291
00:10:29,981 --> 00:10:30,749
You want opinions?

292
00:10:30,782 --> 00:10:31,750
I got them!

293
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:34,152
So each of you will go to the precinct

294
00:10:34,186 --> 00:10:36,221
and cast your private ballots

295
00:10:36,221 --> 00:10:38,256
and rank yourself and your fellow queens

296
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:41,259
from best to worst, from 1 to 7.

297
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,528
Based on overall performances,

298
00:10:43,562 --> 00:10:44,730
audience impact,

299
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:46,031
tiny or well-endowed, or

300
00:10:46,031 --> 00:10:47,566
whatever—top or bottom,

301
00:10:47,566 --> 00:10:49,434
whichever reasons there may be.

302
00:10:49,434 --> 00:10:52,070
So, Queens, grab your ballots and get ready to make your pick.

303
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:55,240
It's time to see who you're ready to elect.

304
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:58,009
Well, rating a queen will be very easy with a score sheet.

305
00:10:58,009 --> 00:11:00,312
During Season 1, we did Rate-A-Queen when

306
00:11:00,345 --> 00:11:01,747
I was also getting high placements.

307
00:11:01,747 --> 00:11:03,715
So the bitches dropped me to the bottom.

308
00:11:03,715 --> 00:11:05,717
Since I was competition, they said.

309
00:11:05,717 --> 00:11:07,986
So I thought, well I guess I'm competition again, okay,

310
00:11:08,019 --> 00:11:10,522
so I expect to be ranked lowest again this time.

311
00:11:12,991 --> 00:11:15,560
Alright, let's start with Arizona Brandy.

312
00:11:18,263 --> 00:11:18,997
Okay.

313
00:11:18,997 --> 00:11:20,732
Seven is...

314
00:11:20,732 --> 00:11:23,535
I love Yuhua as a person, however,

315
00:11:23,568 --> 00:11:24,770
she has to bring more.

316
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:26,171
I want to see her top...

317
00:11:26,171 --> 00:11:28,740
Oh. You really want to see her on top?

318
00:11:28,774 --> 00:11:30,242
Next up, Brigiding.

319
00:11:30,242 --> 00:11:31,409
Who is your best?

320
00:11:31,409 --> 00:11:32,210
Who's your number one?

321
00:11:32,244 --> 00:11:33,745
Viñas DeLuxe.

322
00:11:33,779 --> 00:11:36,648
I can really see the growth of Vinas DeLuxe

323
00:11:36,681 --> 00:11:37,682
from our season.

324
00:11:37,682 --> 00:11:39,351
And how she’s such a risk-taker,

325
00:11:39,351 --> 00:11:40,485
and the belief she has in herself,

326
00:11:40,485 --> 00:11:41,586
it’s so commendable…

327
00:11:41,586 --> 00:11:42,721
And I wished

328
00:11:42,721 --> 00:11:43,789
I have the same.

329
00:11:43,822 --> 00:11:44,990
Khianna.

330
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:46,291
Seven is Siam

331
00:11:46,324 --> 00:11:48,326
because I was a bit scared

332
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,694
- Why?
- of her shouting.

333
00:11:49,694 --> 00:11:50,529
I don't know if

334
00:11:50,529 --> 00:11:52,898
she was serious, or if she was joking, but

335
00:11:52,931 --> 00:11:53,799
I was afraid.

336
00:11:53,832 --> 00:11:54,800
Siam.

337
00:11:54,966 --> 00:11:57,836
The second place, I would love to give to Yuhua.

338
00:11:57,869 --> 00:11:59,638
- Yuhua?
- Because Yuhua is a good friend

339
00:11:59,638 --> 00:12:02,340
and because she's on the same place all the time.

340
00:12:02,607 --> 00:12:04,409
I want to put fire in her.

341
00:12:04,543 --> 00:12:07,045
And the last one, I will give to

342
00:12:07,078 --> 00:12:07,846
Khianna.
Khianna.

343
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:09,881
Not because I think she's not good.

344
00:12:09,881 --> 00:12:11,116
I think she's very good.

345
00:12:11,116 --> 00:12:12,884
And she already got the crown

346
00:12:12,884 --> 00:12:15,287
for the first episode, so...

347
00:12:15,353 --> 00:12:16,254
Khianna,

348
00:12:16,288 --> 00:12:17,355
you already got a crown.

349
00:12:17,389 --> 00:12:18,423
Suki Doll.

350
00:12:18,423 --> 00:12:19,991
My first one is

351
00:12:19,991 --> 00:12:20,959
Brigiding.

352
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:23,695
She is one of my strongest competitors

353
00:12:23,695 --> 00:12:25,530
and she's very well-rounded.

354
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:27,332
How about in kissing?

355
00:12:27,532 --> 00:12:29,467
- The tongue was lacking,
- Okay.

356
00:12:29,467 --> 00:12:30,769
but the saliva was there.

357
00:12:30,936 --> 00:12:32,437
- We'll give her a point for that.
- Definitely there.

358
00:12:32,704 --> 00:12:33,872
Viñas DeLuxe.

359
00:12:33,872 --> 00:12:35,240
So who's your number one?

360
00:12:35,373 --> 00:12:36,775
Myself, of course.

361
00:12:36,808 --> 00:12:38,376
Who else is going to love me,

362
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:39,911
- but myself?
- But yourself...

363
00:12:40,212 --> 00:12:42,247
And my seventh is...

364
00:12:42,247 --> 00:12:43,348
Siam.

365
00:12:43,348 --> 00:12:43,748
Yeah.

366
00:12:43,782 --> 00:12:46,051
She already got more than enough airtime earlier,

367
00:12:46,084 --> 00:12:48,253
so I think it's time for her

368
00:12:48,253 --> 00:12:50,422
- Why? What happened earlier?
- to pack her things. Kidding.

369
00:12:50,522 --> 00:12:51,790
She went crazy earlier.

370
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:54,125
And after she didn’t say she was joking or whatever.

371
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:55,493
So I feel like it was real,

372
00:12:55,527 --> 00:12:57,596
- the outburst was real.
- Outburst? Was she mad?

373
00:12:57,629 --> 00:13:00,398
She totally lost it, got up on the table, and

374
00:13:00,398 --> 00:13:02,767
she was super feeling herself, shouting that she just arrived.

375
00:13:02,767 --> 00:13:04,469
Okay, since you've arrived, now, you can leave.

376
00:13:04,469 --> 00:13:05,103
Kidding!

377
00:13:05,136 --> 00:13:06,905
Start to finish?

378
00:13:06,905 --> 00:13:08,206
And last, we have Yuhua.

379
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,242
I think I'm going to put...

380
00:13:10,442 --> 00:13:12,644
Khianna as number six.

381
00:13:12,911 --> 00:13:14,246
She's fading a little bit.

382
00:13:14,246 --> 00:13:16,948
No tea, no shade. She started off very strong.

383
00:13:17,215 --> 00:13:18,717
But what happened, Khianna?

384
00:13:19,417 --> 00:13:20,018
Queens,

385
00:13:20,018 --> 00:13:22,120
the votes have been cast.

386
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,588
And the tea has been spilled.

387
00:13:23,588 --> 00:13:26,057
So, just like any good election,

388
00:13:26,057 --> 00:13:28,693
there can only be one landslide victory.

389
00:13:28,727 --> 00:13:31,229
Which queen has survived the polls and

390
00:13:31,229 --> 00:13:32,764
dominated the race?

391
00:13:32,797 --> 00:13:34,332
The winner of the Mini Challenge is...

392
00:13:36,534 --> 00:13:38,470
Viñas DeLuxe!

393
00:13:40,739 --> 00:13:42,374
She is the frontrunner.

394
00:13:42,374 --> 00:13:44,376
Might as well give her the first round.

395
00:13:44,442 --> 00:13:46,244
But do I agree with it?

396
00:13:46,311 --> 00:13:47,245
No.

397
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:49,981
Condragulations, Viñas.

398
00:13:49,981 --> 00:13:52,617
- Thank you.
- You’ve won cash tip of 20,000 pesos.

399
00:13:53,318 --> 00:13:54,452
Thank you!

400
00:13:54,452 --> 00:13:55,820
Thank you, Lord!

401
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:58,123
And that's how fast karma works, I love it!

402
00:13:58,156 --> 00:13:59,591
Good karma, come come come.

403
00:13:59,591 --> 00:14:00,125
Kidding!

404
00:14:01,092 --> 00:14:04,095
You got a little taste of politics by ranking your queens

405
00:14:04,129 --> 00:14:05,430
from best to worst.

406
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:08,066
So now, it's time to take things to the next level.

407
00:14:08,066 --> 00:14:10,135
Because for this week's Maxi Challenge,

408
00:14:10,135 --> 00:14:11,202
we will be doing

409
00:14:11,202 --> 00:14:14,406
the Snatch...

410
00:14:14,673 --> 00:14:17,242
Elections!

411
00:14:17,275 --> 00:14:18,410
Snatch Elections.

412
00:14:18,443 --> 00:14:19,678
- Snatch Elections.
- Oh, my God.

413
00:14:19,711 --> 00:14:21,246
Snatch Election?

414
00:14:23,081 --> 00:14:24,649
Instead of a game show,

415
00:14:24,683 --> 00:14:28,086
you, Queens, will be serving the ultimate comedy challenge...

416
00:14:28,586 --> 00:14:29,988
Politics, yes!

417
00:14:30,221 --> 00:14:31,623
That's right, Queens.

418
00:14:32,223 --> 00:14:34,926
You'll each be running for office,

419
00:14:34,926 --> 00:14:36,661
but not as yourselves, of course.

420
00:14:36,695 --> 00:14:37,595
No, no, no, no.

421
00:14:37,595 --> 00:14:39,164
You must transform into a celebrity,

422
00:14:39,164 --> 00:14:41,933
a historical figure, a pop culture icon,

423
00:14:41,967 --> 00:14:43,902
or anyone your heart desires.

424
00:14:43,902 --> 00:14:46,771
And deliver a campaign video so hilarious

425
00:14:46,805 --> 00:14:48,473
it leaves voters and judges

426
00:14:48,506 --> 00:14:49,274
gagged,
gooped,

427
00:14:49,941 --> 00:14:52,777
and flooding the timeline with skull emojis.

428
00:14:52,811 --> 00:14:54,346
And shit emojis.

429
00:14:54,379 --> 00:14:55,714
You will each have 20 minutes

430
00:14:55,714 --> 00:14:58,116
to shoot your snatch election campaign video.

431
00:14:58,116 --> 00:14:58,883
And Viñas,

432
00:14:58,883 --> 00:15:00,652
you're the winner of our Mini Challenge.

433
00:15:00,685 --> 00:15:02,787
You will get an extra minute.

434
00:15:03,321 --> 00:15:04,756
You also have the power

435
00:15:04,789 --> 00:15:08,293
to deduct one minute from one of your fellow queens.

436
00:15:09,661 --> 00:15:12,230
Who would you give that disadvantage to

437
00:15:12,263 --> 00:15:13,832
- and why?
- Siam.

438
00:15:15,667 --> 00:15:16,968
She's so decisive, so

439
00:15:16,968 --> 00:15:19,037
she really has what it takes to be president.

440
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:20,739
Yeah, because she already...

441
00:15:20,772 --> 00:15:22,574
had her one minute earlier

442
00:15:23,641 --> 00:15:25,043
on the table top.

443
00:15:25,076 --> 00:15:27,612
Thank you, Sister, because last time,

444
00:15:27,645 --> 00:15:28,913
when we were doing the Rusical,

445
00:15:28,947 --> 00:15:31,316
I chose her because I know she's really good.

446
00:15:31,316 --> 00:15:33,051
That's why I gave that to her.

447
00:15:33,051 --> 00:15:34,386
This is probably the same thing.

448
00:15:34,419 --> 00:15:36,021
She's probably thinking,

449
00:15:36,054 --> 00:15:37,956
"It's going to be good, going to be fine for Siam."

450
00:15:37,989 --> 00:15:39,557
That's why she picked me.

451
00:15:39,591 --> 00:15:41,126
That means, I'm sorry, Siam,

452
00:15:41,126 --> 00:15:43,762
you will only be getting 19 minutes

453
00:15:43,762 --> 00:15:47,832
to shoot your campaign video as decided by Viñas DeLuxe.

454
00:15:48,366 --> 00:15:50,402
So use all of your time wisely

455
00:15:50,402 --> 00:15:52,404
and judiciously.

456
00:15:52,637 --> 00:15:55,306
JUDICIOUSLY?!

457
00:15:55,607 --> 00:15:57,675
Get ready to shake some hands,

458
00:15:57,709 --> 00:15:58,910
make big promises

459
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:00,311
you, yourself cannot keep,

460
00:16:00,345 --> 00:16:01,679
and most importantly,

461
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:03,048
make us laugh.

462
00:16:03,214 --> 00:16:04,382
- Yes.
- Alright?

463
00:16:04,482 --> 00:16:05,850
Bye, Queens! See you later!

464
00:16:05,884 --> 00:16:08,253
- Thank you, Mama Pao!
- Bye!

465
00:16:08,253 --> 00:16:09,954
Bye?!

466
00:16:14,359 --> 00:16:16,561
How are you, Yuhua?

467
00:16:16,628 --> 00:16:19,464
This snatch game is not any snatch game,

468
00:16:19,464 --> 00:16:22,934
but a campaign for running for president.

469
00:16:24,269 --> 00:16:25,904
This is going to be so much fun!

470
00:16:25,904 --> 00:16:28,306
I'm good. I'm jotting down every idea

471
00:16:28,306 --> 00:16:30,241
that's coming into my head, and then I'm going to

472
00:16:30,241 --> 00:16:31,443
slim it down

473
00:16:31,476 --> 00:16:33,211
and see which ones work best.

474
00:16:33,211 --> 00:16:34,813
I'm trying to

475
00:16:34,813 --> 00:16:36,748
think of the corresponding

476
00:16:36,781 --> 00:16:40,085
video of the lines that I am thinking.

477
00:16:40,118 --> 00:16:41,486
Here we go again!

478
00:16:41,486 --> 00:16:43,688
Another triggering challenge!

479
00:16:43,922 --> 00:16:46,357
Girl, the humiliation that I got from the Snatch Game

480
00:16:46,357 --> 00:16:47,859
in Season 1...

481
00:16:48,026 --> 00:16:49,294
It was so bad.

482
00:16:49,327 --> 00:16:51,429
I wish I can do better this time.

483
00:16:51,429 --> 00:16:53,031
Can I give you a little bit of advice?

484
00:16:53,031 --> 00:16:54,032
Okay, go.

485
00:16:54,032 --> 00:16:56,201
- Have the lines ready first
- Yeah.

486
00:16:56,234 --> 00:16:57,435
that you want to use in the story

487
00:16:57,435 --> 00:16:58,970
that you want to convey in the message.

488
00:16:59,003 --> 00:17:01,339
And then go to the video.

489
00:17:01,339 --> 00:17:02,207
The visual.

490
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:03,408
Yeah, because right now it seems like

491
00:17:03,408 --> 00:17:05,944
you are trying to run before you can even walk.

492
00:17:05,944 --> 00:17:08,813
This is the week and challenge where I want

493
00:17:08,813 --> 00:17:11,616
to prove to everyone that I'm not

494
00:17:11,649 --> 00:17:12,884
stupid when it comes to comedy.

495
00:17:12,884 --> 00:17:14,419
I'm not a flop.

496
00:17:16,321 --> 00:17:18,156
Haller! Haller! Haller!

497
00:17:18,156 --> 00:17:20,158
You're all so serious, huh?

498
00:17:20,158 --> 00:17:22,026
My presidentiables.

499
00:17:24,295 --> 00:17:26,764
Who's ready to snatch some votes?

500
00:17:26,865 --> 00:17:28,466
Well, let's see what you have so far.

501
00:17:28,466 --> 00:17:29,567
Let's start with

502
00:17:29,567 --> 00:17:31,836
Viñas, Siam, and Khianna.

503
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:33,171
What's your character?

504
00:17:33,304 --> 00:17:36,407
Lisa. But I'm going to use a name like

505
00:17:36,474 --> 00:17:37,542
Phnom Look

506
00:17:37,542 --> 00:17:39,344
from Blackpink Lotus.

507
00:17:39,344 --> 00:17:41,012
Oh. Blackpink Lotus?

508
00:17:41,112 --> 00:17:44,849
I'm gonna be impersonating Lalisa.

509
00:17:44,849 --> 00:17:47,986
But I will do the version of her in her series.

510
00:17:48,019 --> 00:17:50,955
Because in her series, it's pretty much me, you know?

511
00:17:50,955 --> 00:17:53,358
Because they have like a Thai dancing scene.

512
00:17:53,691 --> 00:17:55,160
She's like a server,

513
00:17:55,193 --> 00:17:58,263
from a wellness center, and I feel like...

514
00:17:58,296 --> 00:18:00,064
I can see myself doing that.

515
00:18:00,064 --> 00:18:00,899
It's going to be fun.

516
00:18:00,965 --> 00:18:03,468
Khianna, you've been in the safe zone.

517
00:18:03,501 --> 00:18:05,036
When are you going to be on top again?

518
00:18:05,036 --> 00:18:06,838
I think this time I'm going be on top.

519
00:18:06,871 --> 00:18:10,675
And I am manifesting that because I know that

520
00:18:11,843 --> 00:18:13,878
I'm gonna be on top this week.

521
00:18:13,878 --> 00:18:14,579
So, I hope.

522
00:18:14,579 --> 00:18:16,347
I'm doing Mommy Oni.

523
00:18:16,614 --> 00:18:18,550
Or should I say, Toni

524
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:19,651
FollowHer.

525
00:18:19,651 --> 00:18:20,518
Oh...

526
00:18:20,518 --> 00:18:21,753
Toni FollowHer.

527
00:18:21,753 --> 00:18:23,821
So I decided to go

528
00:18:23,821 --> 00:18:25,890
and choose Mommy Oni.

529
00:18:26,624 --> 00:18:27,959
She is...

530
00:18:27,959 --> 00:18:28,893
an actress.

531
00:18:28,893 --> 00:18:30,061
She is a singer.

532
00:18:30,094 --> 00:18:31,129
She's a rapper.

533
00:18:31,129 --> 00:18:32,363
She's known for the boobs.

534
00:18:32,363 --> 00:18:33,865
She's known for the hips.

535
00:18:33,865 --> 00:18:35,733
I'm very confident about this, Mama Pao.

536
00:18:35,733 --> 00:18:37,335
I hope you can see it.

537
00:18:37,602 --> 00:18:38,503
I have seen it.

538
00:18:38,703 --> 00:18:41,172
Bitch, I’ve seen those big boob looks before.

539
00:18:41,172 --> 00:18:43,041
I know you're worried about the looks, but

540
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:44,442
I know that this is going to be good.

541
00:18:44,475 --> 00:18:46,578
- Don't you worry, Mama Pao.
- And I believe in you.

542
00:18:46,744 --> 00:18:47,445
I know.

543
00:18:47,478 --> 00:18:51,249
My plan for this Snatch Election,

544
00:18:51,282 --> 00:18:53,318
I am just going to, you know...

545
00:18:55,286 --> 00:18:56,688
Actually, I don't have a plan.

546
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:01,259
That's where the challenge is.

547
00:19:01,292 --> 00:19:03,061
So, I think I'm taking a risk

548
00:19:03,094 --> 00:19:06,197
because Mami Oni has a lot of viral moments.

549
00:19:06,231 --> 00:19:07,298
Viñas.

550
00:19:07,298 --> 00:19:09,801
Well, are you're doing two characters again?

551
00:19:09,801 --> 00:19:11,469
Ah no!

552
00:19:12,036 --> 00:19:14,005
Still challenging myself,

553
00:19:14,038 --> 00:19:15,873
and I hope it pays off this time.

554
00:19:15,873 --> 00:19:16,908
I'm going to be doing

555
00:19:16,908 --> 00:19:19,010
Inday Sara.
(The current Vice President on the Philippines)

556
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:21,112
And I'm very open for suggestions

557
00:19:21,112 --> 00:19:22,880
although I'm Sara.
(Sará is a Filipino word that means to close)

558
00:19:22,947 --> 00:19:24,415
It's my first time to do a

559
00:19:24,415 --> 00:19:26,417
political character

560
00:19:26,417 --> 00:19:28,319
because I'm still hesitant to

561
00:19:28,353 --> 00:19:29,487
touch such topics especially when

562
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,356
I'm not so educated about it yet.

563
00:19:31,389 --> 00:19:33,491
So, I'm willing to take a risk

564
00:19:33,491 --> 00:19:35,093
and I hope it pays off.

565
00:19:35,093 --> 00:19:35,860
If not,

566
00:19:35,893 --> 00:19:38,196
then so be it.

567
00:19:38,229 --> 00:19:41,299
Suki, Brigiding, Yuhua, and Arizona.

568
00:19:41,399 --> 00:19:43,635
My Snatch Game character is Lyn May.

569
00:19:43,635 --> 00:19:45,903
She's an old sex icon.

570
00:19:45,937 --> 00:19:47,639
She used to be an exotic dancer.

571
00:19:47,639 --> 00:19:49,307
She was popular in the 70s, 80s.

572
00:19:49,307 --> 00:19:50,842
So she is now

573
00:19:50,842 --> 00:19:52,277
recognized a lot on TikTok

574
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:53,945
He has lots of notes.

575
00:19:54,379 --> 00:19:56,748
There's Excel sheets for everything.

576
00:19:56,848 --> 00:19:58,049
Oh, you're so prepared.

577
00:19:58,049 --> 00:19:58,983
Yes, I'm very prepared

578
00:19:58,983 --> 00:20:01,219
because I left on Snatch Game in my season.

579
00:20:01,219 --> 00:20:02,553
What did you do in your season?

580
00:20:02,587 --> 00:20:03,788
What did I not do?

581
00:20:03,988 --> 00:20:06,724
I did Yoko Ono and I went for the smart route

582
00:20:06,724 --> 00:20:09,794
and honestly, my humor is a bit more direct.

583
00:20:09,827 --> 00:20:10,395
Okay.

584
00:20:10,428 --> 00:20:11,529
So I went more direct this time.

585
00:20:11,529 --> 00:20:13,965
So this character itself, it's already over the top.

586
00:20:13,965 --> 00:20:15,199
So I think the

587
00:20:15,199 --> 00:20:17,302
physical comedy is the route to go.

588
00:20:17,335 --> 00:20:18,670
Alright, Arizona.

589
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:21,506
I'm doing Lynn from Las Vegas

590
00:20:21,506 --> 00:20:22,440
Models.

591
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,776
We've seen her one-minute video

592
00:20:24,776 --> 00:20:26,444
and it's gone viral.

593
00:20:26,444 --> 00:20:29,414
I want to bring her more life this time.

594
00:20:29,414 --> 00:20:31,449
I don't want to make fun of her accent.

595
00:20:31,449 --> 00:20:32,617
I want her to have like

596
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:34,719
a dimension that she's smart.

597
00:20:34,752 --> 00:20:36,821
My strategy in winning this Snatch Game

598
00:20:36,821 --> 00:20:38,289
is I'm gonna amp it up.

599
00:20:38,323 --> 00:20:41,459
If I think I'm on the 150%,

600
00:20:41,492 --> 00:20:43,061
I'm going to crank it to

601
00:20:43,061 --> 00:20:45,063
151%.

602
00:20:46,064 --> 00:20:48,599
Brigiding. I remember in your season,

603
00:20:48,599 --> 00:20:49,701
you almost went home

604
00:20:49,701 --> 00:20:51,369
- because of this challenge, right?
- Yes.

605
00:20:51,402 --> 00:20:53,771
I'm honestly very anxious, Mama Pao, because

606
00:20:53,771 --> 00:20:56,808
impersonation is really not my turf.

607
00:20:56,908 --> 00:20:58,176
But I have prepared

608
00:20:58,176 --> 00:20:59,143
Maria Ressa.

609
00:20:59,177 --> 00:21:01,546
Maria Ressa is one of the

610
00:21:01,579 --> 00:21:04,248
iconic figures in the field of mass media.

611
00:21:04,248 --> 00:21:07,485
I went with someone who's very serious,

612
00:21:07,685 --> 00:21:09,687
who is very prim and proper.

613
00:21:09,754 --> 00:21:10,788
Like me.

614
00:21:10,822 --> 00:21:13,424
So I won't have a hard time characterizing her.

615
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:14,158
But,

616
00:21:14,158 --> 00:21:16,160
the challenge is to make her funny.

617
00:21:16,194 --> 00:21:16,794
Yuhua.
Yes.

618
00:21:17,328 --> 00:21:20,398
I'm doing Anna Delvey. She's a scam artist.
(A known mini series was inspired by the story of her life.)

619
00:21:20,398 --> 00:21:22,600
But the thing is that she's so direct.

620
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,769
She's not afraid to admit that she is a scam artist.

621
00:21:24,836 --> 00:21:25,670
She's proud of it.

622
00:21:25,703 --> 00:21:27,605
So I want to take all the political stuff

623
00:21:27,605 --> 00:21:29,774
that politicians say and make fun of it.

624
00:21:29,807 --> 00:21:32,176
What you have said is actually really good.

625
00:21:32,443 --> 00:21:35,046
For me, what's funny is really being natural.

626
00:21:35,079 --> 00:21:36,214
Thank you so much for that.

627
00:21:36,214 --> 00:21:38,416
It's perfect for this campaign because

628
00:21:38,449 --> 00:21:41,219
politicians are also con artists, and what?

629
00:21:41,219 --> 00:21:43,554
Anna Delvey is also a con artist.

630
00:21:43,588 --> 00:21:46,424
- Good luck, Queens!
- Thank you!

631
00:21:46,457 --> 00:21:48,126
Tomorrow, Queens,

632
00:21:48,126 --> 00:21:51,362
the judges and I will watch your campaign videos

633
00:21:51,396 --> 00:21:52,630
on the Main Stage.

634
00:21:52,663 --> 00:21:54,365
And on the Runway, category is...

635
00:21:54,365 --> 00:21:57,668
Asian Mythical Creature Couture!

636
00:21:57,668 --> 00:21:59,437
Yaaas!

637
00:21:59,871 --> 00:22:01,973
#SlaysianRoyale

638
00:22:02,173 --> 00:22:03,074
Good luck, Queens.

639
00:22:03,107 --> 00:22:04,275
And don't fuck it up.

640
00:22:04,308 --> 00:22:06,477
- Yeah!
- Thank you, Mama Pao!

641
00:22:06,477 --> 00:22:07,445
Bye!

642
00:22:07,979 --> 00:22:09,180
Wait, there's more.

643
00:22:09,447 --> 00:22:10,248
Oh.

644
00:22:11,749 --> 00:22:13,017
Oh, Pit Crew!

645
00:22:16,187 --> 00:22:17,155
Oh!

646
00:22:17,388 --> 00:22:18,956
What's that?

647
00:22:19,023 --> 00:22:21,626
Here's the folder with the Rate-A-Queen results.

648
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:25,096
Inside, you'll see the final tally of the votes.

649
00:22:25,096 --> 00:22:27,265
You will see who scored high and low.

650
00:22:27,265 --> 00:22:29,167
And more importantly,

651
00:22:29,167 --> 00:22:31,002
who voted for whom.

652
00:22:31,002 --> 00:22:31,569
Okay?

653
00:22:31,636 --> 00:22:33,037
Yas!

654
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:34,405
Oh, okay.

655
00:22:34,439 --> 00:22:35,540
It's time to know

656
00:22:35,573 --> 00:22:37,508
what other people are thinking.

657
00:22:37,542 --> 00:22:39,010
So, I'm just going to leave it here.

658
00:22:39,043 --> 00:22:39,844
You open it.
Don't open it.

659
00:22:40,478 --> 00:22:41,412
It's up to you.

660
00:22:41,412 --> 00:22:42,613
Bye, Queens!

661
00:22:42,613 --> 00:22:44,081
- No! No!
- Let's burn it!

662
00:22:44,115 --> 00:22:46,017
- Everybody, just get your sheets and then go.
- Good luck!

663
00:22:47,051 --> 00:22:49,387
You're opening it. Bye, Queens! I don't wanna see it!

664
00:22:49,387 --> 00:22:51,589
- Open it, girl!
- Are we going to open it?

665
00:22:51,789 --> 00:22:52,690
Oh, my God.

666
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:54,859
I really didn't wanna open it, but Suki,

667
00:22:54,859 --> 00:22:57,428
the drama of it all Mother Lily, she really...

668
00:22:57,462 --> 00:22:58,963
wanted to open it immediately.

669
00:22:58,963 --> 00:23:01,332
Number one, Viñas DeLuxe.

670
00:23:01,332 --> 00:23:02,200
Number two,
Brigiding.

671
00:23:03,134 --> 00:23:05,403
Number three, four, together,

672
00:23:05,436 --> 00:23:07,238
Arizona and Suki.

673
00:23:07,305 --> 00:23:09,273
Fifth, Khianna.

674
00:23:09,507 --> 00:23:10,708
Okay.

675
00:23:10,775 --> 00:23:12,743
Six, Yuhua.

676
00:23:12,777 --> 00:23:14,879
Seven, Siam.

677
00:23:15,313 --> 00:23:17,982
- We want to take our sheet personally.
- It is what it is.

678
00:23:18,082 --> 00:23:20,084
My personal ranking was number six.

679
00:23:20,084 --> 00:23:21,786
Do I care what other people think?

680
00:23:21,819 --> 00:23:22,320
No.

681
00:23:22,954 --> 00:23:24,155
Are you good?

682
00:23:26,057 --> 00:23:28,493
I put too much pressure on myself.

683
00:23:28,593 --> 00:23:29,927
To be in this show.

684
00:23:29,927 --> 00:23:31,929
And I know...

685
00:23:36,234 --> 00:23:38,536
I just didn't want to...

686
00:23:38,603 --> 00:23:39,871
deal with him.

687
00:23:39,871 --> 00:23:43,140
That's up to you if you want to hog all the airtime.

688
00:23:43,541 --> 00:23:44,542
I'm so sorry if

689
00:23:44,542 --> 00:23:46,143
I made you all scared.

690
00:23:46,177 --> 00:23:47,278
You didn't scare me

691
00:23:47,278 --> 00:23:50,581
and I think I can speak for most of us when I say

692
00:23:50,581 --> 00:23:52,316
that we're more worried for you.

693
00:23:52,316 --> 00:23:54,452
I don't think this translated on the chart,

694
00:23:54,452 --> 00:23:56,254
because of what happened this morning.

695
00:23:56,287 --> 00:23:58,189
I think we all agree on that, right?

696
00:23:58,222 --> 00:23:59,156
You're going to be okay.

697
00:23:59,156 --> 00:24:00,591
- We're all good.
- Yeah.

698
00:24:00,625 --> 00:24:01,792
We're all fine.

699
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:03,494
Maybe we can leave this.

700
00:24:03,528 --> 00:24:04,829
- We can go back to work.
- Let's do this.

701
00:24:04,829 --> 00:24:04,929
- We can go back to work.
- Let's do this.

702
00:24:04,929 --> 00:24:07,164
We will talk more about this later for sure.

703
00:24:11,536 --> 00:24:13,004
Are you crying?

704
00:24:15,273 --> 00:24:17,141
I'm trying so hard

705
00:24:18,376 --> 00:24:20,411
to feel like I belong here but

706
00:24:20,411 --> 00:24:24,549
after everything, I feel like I'm really not okay.

707
00:24:24,615 --> 00:24:25,449
In all the challenges,

708
00:24:25,449 --> 00:24:27,318
I know that I'm giving my best.

709
00:24:27,351 --> 00:24:30,154
I am giving the mostest that I can

710
00:24:30,187 --> 00:24:31,455
give to everybody.

711
00:24:31,455 --> 00:24:34,325
So I don't know where I'm lacking.

712
00:24:34,325 --> 00:24:35,993
I've been enjoying

713
00:24:35,993 --> 00:24:38,829
but it seems like I'm not good enough.

714
00:24:40,598 --> 00:24:42,333
It just makes me think that

715
00:24:42,366 --> 00:24:44,969
I don't think I deserve to be here with them

716
00:24:44,969 --> 00:24:46,737
because they're so good.

717
00:24:47,338 --> 00:24:49,073
I'm so tired.

718
00:24:49,373 --> 00:24:51,342
All of us here are tired.

719
00:24:51,375 --> 00:24:53,377
We're all exhausted.

720
00:24:54,011 --> 00:24:56,881
These last challenges,

721
00:24:56,881 --> 00:24:59,417
these will forever dictate

722
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:02,219
what happens to us and our careers.

723
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:03,921
I've seen many situations

724
00:25:03,921 --> 00:25:05,256
where people just lose control

725
00:25:05,289 --> 00:25:07,925
because they are under a lot of pressure and they crack.

726
00:25:07,959 --> 00:25:09,460
It's only human.

727
00:25:09,493 --> 00:25:12,129
And I just need to make sure that everyone's okay.

728
00:25:12,129 --> 00:25:12,496
And I just need to make sure that everyone's okay.

729
00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:15,466
It's a big thing and it wasn't good that I did that.

730
00:25:15,499 --> 00:25:18,035
But sometimes, I still don't know

731
00:25:18,102 --> 00:25:19,236
what's going on.

732
00:25:19,804 --> 00:25:21,639
It came as a surprise, obviously.

733
00:25:22,106 --> 00:25:23,474
And I'm just making sure that

734
00:25:23,474 --> 00:25:24,575
you're okay.

735
00:25:26,277 --> 00:25:28,546
Thank you for everything.

736
00:25:31,782 --> 00:25:32,683
You're gonna be fine.

737
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:34,619
Drama queen.

738
00:25:35,453 --> 00:25:37,121
Don't let those comments

739
00:25:37,154 --> 00:25:38,489
affect you.

740
00:25:38,522 --> 00:25:40,691
I was making coffee when she told me,

741
00:25:40,691 --> 00:25:42,493
"You don't know me."

742
00:25:42,627 --> 00:25:45,196
"I just arrived. I just got here."

743
00:25:45,229 --> 00:25:46,831
"And you'll know who I am."

744
00:25:47,098 --> 00:25:50,101
She told me, "There's a reason why I'm here."

745
00:25:50,134 --> 00:25:51,769
"There's a reason why I was invited to come."

746
00:25:51,802 --> 00:25:53,170
I was really freaked out.

747
00:25:53,404 --> 00:25:54,605
- You were freaked out?
- Yes, sis.

748
00:25:54,639 --> 00:25:56,440
I mean, why would you suddenly do that?

749
00:25:56,474 --> 00:25:58,909
And then she just cackled, loudly.

750
00:25:58,909 --> 00:26:01,779
And now she's crying again because there's a camera.

751
00:26:01,812 --> 00:26:03,047
It's bullshit.

752
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:05,282
So I felt like, oh, my God, this person

753
00:26:05,316 --> 00:26:06,550
cannot be trusted.

754
00:26:06,684 --> 00:26:07,985
Then I asked her,

755
00:26:07,985 --> 00:26:09,453
"Do you do...

756
00:26:09,453 --> 00:26:10,521
witchcraft?"

757
00:26:10,521 --> 00:26:11,522
She said,

758
00:26:11,555 --> 00:26:12,957
"I can't say it...

759
00:26:12,957 --> 00:26:14,959
because of the Gods."

760
00:26:15,092 --> 00:26:16,827
You really believe in those things?

761
00:26:16,827 --> 00:26:18,929
Yes, Sis. My last experience was that.

762
00:26:18,963 --> 00:26:20,564
And it's very traumatic.

763
00:26:21,732 --> 00:26:24,068
And I can't allow someone like that

764
00:26:24,068 --> 00:26:25,736
in my life once again.

765
00:26:25,836 --> 00:26:27,772
I'm not exactly a believer,

766
00:26:27,772 --> 00:26:29,206
but I had a friend,

767
00:26:29,206 --> 00:26:32,410
who, after our friendship, I discovered that

768
00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:34,612
that person was doing things

769
00:26:34,645 --> 00:26:37,481
like lighting black candles,

770
00:26:37,515 --> 00:26:40,785
cursing or hexing other people,

771
00:26:40,785 --> 00:26:43,888
goes to Quiapo to buy potions and stuff like that.

772
00:26:43,888 --> 00:26:46,157
So I don't know if its the same thing for Siam,

773
00:26:46,157 --> 00:26:48,993
but I saw her hand gestures,

774
00:26:48,993 --> 00:26:51,929
and similar movements that my ex friend did before.

775
00:26:51,962 --> 00:26:53,431
Is it also triggering you,

776
00:26:53,431 --> 00:26:54,999
- your experiences?
- Yeah.

777
00:26:55,032 --> 00:26:56,500
I just prayed for her

778
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:59,470
and I hope she's in a proper mindset

779
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:01,806
and that she's okay.

780
00:27:01,839 --> 00:27:04,375
So she doesn't turn into whatever that was.

781
00:27:04,375 --> 00:27:06,644
Shoo away the energy since it's a...

782
00:27:06,677 --> 00:27:08,946
Yeah, I'll shoo it later,

783
00:27:08,946 --> 00:27:10,715
when my character's whole.

784
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:14,518
Let's start with the shots

785
00:27:14,518 --> 00:27:16,087
with this set up.

786
00:27:16,087 --> 00:27:17,655
I'm the first to shoot my video

787
00:27:17,688 --> 00:27:19,123
and I'm freaking out because

788
00:27:19,156 --> 00:27:20,624
what if it flops?

789
00:27:20,658 --> 00:27:22,059
So, this is scrapped.

790
00:27:22,126 --> 00:27:24,128
I need the Pit Crew now.

791
00:27:24,161 --> 00:27:26,430
- Is it okay if I touch your butts?
- Of course.

792
00:27:26,464 --> 00:27:28,432
So we're going to do a tight shot first.

793
00:27:28,432 --> 00:27:30,401
My experience with shooting the campaign video is

794
00:27:30,401 --> 00:27:31,602
very straightforward.

795
00:27:31,602 --> 00:27:34,238
I just started doing all the scenes,

796
00:27:34,271 --> 00:27:35,072
one by one.
Action!

797
00:27:35,473 --> 00:27:36,874
For you.

798
00:27:36,874 --> 00:27:38,175
And you.

799
00:27:38,175 --> 00:27:39,543
Fuck you.

800
00:27:41,278 --> 00:27:44,381
It's so funny, like, I am enjoying myself.

801
00:27:44,415 --> 00:27:45,883
Because when you have nothing in your gut,

802
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:47,418
your nips will smell like butt.

803
00:27:47,752 --> 00:27:48,452
Word for-

804
00:27:49,153 --> 00:27:52,056
I just have simple lines

805
00:27:52,089 --> 00:27:54,125
but I'll show more acting.

806
00:27:54,125 --> 00:27:55,559
Hello!

807
00:27:55,593 --> 00:27:57,194
“Look” is here.

808
00:27:57,228 --> 00:28:01,031
I enjoyed my drag version of Lisa because

809
00:28:01,065 --> 00:28:03,467
I know Lisa is not going to do anything like this.

810
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:05,569
So, I'll be the unique one.

811
00:28:05,603 --> 00:28:07,171
Lisa, thank you!

812
00:28:07,204 --> 00:28:08,572
I already done the...

813
00:28:08,572 --> 00:28:09,840
I already-

814
00:28:10,307 --> 00:28:11,876
I already run

815
00:28:11,909 --> 00:28:13,911
the whole damn resort.

816
00:28:13,911 --> 00:28:15,913
And you have to lift me up.

817
00:28:16,347 --> 00:28:18,582
And you have to pass through the table.

818
00:28:18,783 --> 00:28:20,518
Pass through the table.

819
00:28:20,518 --> 00:28:21,685
Across, like that.

820
00:28:21,685 --> 00:28:22,686
Okay, this is how you do it.

821
00:28:22,753 --> 00:28:23,954
Stand over here, look at me.

822
00:28:24,121 --> 00:28:25,756
Sorry if I'm being direct.

823
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:28,125
I have a very limited time. You're going to be like

824
00:28:28,225 --> 00:28:28,993
very sad.

825
00:28:28,993 --> 00:28:30,828
Girl, there was a lot of things going on.

826
00:28:30,861 --> 00:28:32,863
Baby, I've got 20 minutes to make

827
00:28:32,863 --> 00:28:33,931
this campaign work.

828
00:28:33,931 --> 00:28:35,366
You don't look excited, baby.

829
00:28:35,966 --> 00:28:37,234
Smile, baby! Smile!

830
00:28:37,234 --> 00:28:38,102
Smile! Come on!

831
00:28:38,135 --> 00:28:40,504
This is a Yuhua-produced movie.

832
00:28:40,638 --> 00:28:42,006
But I think that at the end of the day,

833
00:28:42,006 --> 00:28:43,140
it was a success.

834
00:28:43,207 --> 00:28:44,275
Very good! Okay, perfect!

835
00:28:44,275 --> 00:28:45,409
So I'll be in the wide shot first,

836
00:28:45,409 --> 00:28:47,845
then when I turn, go into the medium shot.

837
00:28:47,878 --> 00:28:50,114
please do a super extra close-up.

838
00:28:50,247 --> 00:28:51,982
That's it!

839
00:28:52,116 --> 00:28:53,017
Shit, I look ridiculous.

840
00:28:53,050 --> 00:28:54,018
Okay, go.

841
00:28:54,051 --> 00:28:55,519
As a producer, and

842
00:28:55,519 --> 00:28:56,887
I've also directed,

843
00:28:56,887 --> 00:28:58,155
I've also acted,

844
00:28:58,155 --> 00:28:59,957
you know, I have background in that.

845
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:01,859
I know what I want.

846
00:29:01,892 --> 00:29:04,161
Shh! Quiet on the set!

847
00:29:04,195 --> 00:29:05,029
Okay.

848
00:29:05,229 --> 00:29:06,897
It was very smooth.

849
00:29:07,164 --> 00:29:09,433
That's a wrap! Oh, my God!

850
00:29:09,466 --> 00:29:11,168
Thank you!

851
00:29:12,102 --> 00:29:14,071
I am Inday Sara.

852
00:29:14,104 --> 00:29:15,306
One more time.

853
00:29:15,406 --> 00:29:17,208
I've been preparing for the Snatch Game,

854
00:29:17,208 --> 00:29:18,742
so I thought I was ready.

855
00:29:18,742 --> 00:29:20,978
Turns out, I only prepared for one aspect.

856
00:29:21,011 --> 00:29:22,146
Just the punchlines.

857
00:29:22,179 --> 00:29:24,148
I wasn't able to practice how she stands,

858
00:29:24,181 --> 00:29:25,783
things like that.

859
00:29:25,816 --> 00:29:27,585
I am Inday Sara.

860
00:29:27,618 --> 00:29:28,385
Oh, sorry.
Again.

861
00:29:28,819 --> 00:29:30,821
I am your VP BP Sara.

862
00:29:30,888 --> 00:29:32,122
That was a struggle.

863
00:29:32,156 --> 00:29:34,925
A lot was going on in my head and I have to

864
00:29:34,959 --> 00:29:37,194
live up to my RuBadges.

865
00:29:37,194 --> 00:29:38,929
I can’t afford a misstep.

866
00:29:38,929 --> 00:29:40,097
That's okay.

867
00:29:40,197 --> 00:29:41,632
Double-checked everything.

868
00:29:41,665 --> 00:29:42,666
That's it.

869
00:30:05,289 --> 00:30:06,590
Mabuheeey!

870
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:07,758
I'm your mothertucking host,

871
00:30:07,791 --> 00:30:09,460
and welcome to the Main Stage of

872
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:13,464
Drag Race Philippines: Slaysian Royale!

873
00:30:13,497 --> 00:30:15,532
Drag Race Philippines, Season 2 Winner,

874
00:30:15,566 --> 00:30:17,134
Captivating Katkat.

875
00:30:17,134 --> 00:30:18,469
Hi, Katkat.

876
00:30:18,469 --> 00:30:20,804
What would be your political slogan?

877
00:30:20,938 --> 00:30:22,740
With Captivating Katkat,

878
00:30:22,773 --> 00:30:24,642
no dicks get bitten

879
00:30:24,642 --> 00:30:26,510
but everyone gets ridden

880
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:27,978
for free every night!

881
00:30:28,012 --> 00:30:31,348
Tempting! You have my vote, Katkat.

882
00:30:31,382 --> 00:30:33,484
And we also have Global Drag Superstar,

883
00:30:33,517 --> 00:30:35,219
Alyssa Edwards.

884
00:30:35,219 --> 00:30:38,355
Alyssa, if you were to become the global president,

885
00:30:38,422 --> 00:30:39,957
what would be the first act

886
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:41,091
that you would sign?

887
00:30:42,626 --> 00:30:44,261
And world peace.

888
00:30:44,261 --> 00:30:45,062
Oh.

889
00:30:46,397 --> 00:30:48,499
You also have my vote, Alyssa.

890
00:30:48,499 --> 00:30:51,468
Alyssa for Sergeant at Arms!

891
00:30:52,336 --> 00:30:54,872
This week, we challenged our queens to become

892
00:30:54,872 --> 00:30:56,974
political animals in the very first

893
00:30:57,007 --> 00:30:58,709
Snatch Elections.

894
00:30:58,742 --> 00:31:00,477
And tonight on the Runway,

895
00:31:00,544 --> 00:31:02,546
they will take us to different worlds

896
00:31:02,546 --> 00:31:05,883
with their mystical and fantastical looks.

897
00:31:07,284 --> 00:31:08,519
Racers,

898
00:31:08,519 --> 00:31:10,054
start your engines

899
00:31:10,054 --> 00:31:11,255
and may the best

900
00:31:11,288 --> 00:31:14,191
Slaysian Queen, win!

901
00:31:16,327 --> 00:31:17,528
Category is...

902
00:31:17,561 --> 00:31:20,164
“Asian Mythical Creature Couture”

903
00:31:20,164 --> 00:31:20,798
First up,

904
00:31:21,098 --> 00:31:22,700
Arizona Brandy.

905
00:31:22,733 --> 00:31:24,802
For the Mythical Creature Runway,

906
00:31:24,835 --> 00:31:27,438
I'm serving you Tiktik realness.
(Filipino monster)

907
00:31:27,438 --> 00:31:27,938
Oh!

908
00:31:27,938 --> 00:31:31,175
I'm tongue-tied!

909
00:31:31,775 --> 00:31:33,344
I'm serving you tongue,

910
00:31:33,344 --> 00:31:35,112
I'm serving you body,

911
00:31:35,145 --> 00:31:38,782
I'm still serving you glam while serving you gore.

912
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:46,256
Now can she do that with that tongue?

913
00:31:47,858 --> 00:31:49,893
Tongue-ina mo, Arizona.

914
00:32:00,838 --> 00:32:02,673
Siam Phusri!

915
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:04,208
Oh...

916
00:32:04,808 --> 00:32:07,778
She done already done had her horses!

917
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:12,883
In this Runway, I embody the horse

918
00:32:12,883 --> 00:32:14,485
for the Buddha.

919
00:32:14,485 --> 00:32:16,787
So this horse is the one

920
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:18,389
who sent him

921
00:32:18,422 --> 00:32:19,790
to become a Buddha.

922
00:32:19,923 --> 00:32:22,960
So I'm so proud and so grateful

923
00:32:22,993 --> 00:32:25,062
to embody the horse, you know?

924
00:32:25,095 --> 00:32:27,731
So now it's time for him

925
00:32:27,731 --> 00:32:30,968
to entertain the world and become a drag horse

926
00:32:31,001 --> 00:32:33,103
like what you guys see right now.

927
00:32:33,303 --> 00:32:34,772
Now watch her whip!

928
00:32:34,805 --> 00:32:37,307
Watch her neigh!

929
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:43,847
Brigiding.

930
00:32:44,882 --> 00:32:48,352
Peek-a-bull!

931
00:32:49,987 --> 00:32:51,855
I am the Sarangay.

932
00:32:51,855 --> 00:32:54,992
The protector of precious jewels.

933
00:32:54,992 --> 00:32:57,327
I'm horny for expensive,

934
00:32:57,361 --> 00:32:58,328
precious,

935
00:32:58,328 --> 00:32:59,496
captivating and

936
00:32:59,496 --> 00:33:01,498
maxie-mum jewelries.

937
00:33:01,532 --> 00:33:03,367
Cara-bow before me.

938
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,635
Mama Pao!

939
00:33:04,701 --> 00:33:06,904
Don't be so bull-headed, give me a chance!

940
00:33:06,970 --> 00:33:09,440
You're so horny!

941
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,876
Now get a load of this bullshit!

942
00:33:23,353 --> 00:33:24,888
Suki Doll!

943
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:31,295
Oh!

944
00:33:31,295 --> 00:33:33,330
Can you wing my bell?

945
00:33:33,497 --> 00:33:36,733
The ghost cicada is a very traditional

946
00:33:36,733 --> 00:33:40,270
folklore character in the Thai and Chinese history.

947
00:33:40,304 --> 00:33:41,271
It is an

948
00:33:41,271 --> 00:33:43,273
insect that takes the soul away

949
00:33:43,307 --> 00:33:45,542
from the people that are living and dead.

950
00:33:45,576 --> 00:33:46,743
Now, in this Runway,

951
00:33:46,743 --> 00:33:49,179
I want to represent the shape of Mugler

952
00:33:49,179 --> 00:33:51,215
and make it into something that is

953
00:33:51,215 --> 00:33:52,249
a la Suki Doll.

954
00:33:52,249 --> 00:33:55,419
There's so much love and labor going to this design.

955
00:33:55,586 --> 00:33:57,888
- Now, that's a fly girl.
- Uh huh.

956
00:33:57,921 --> 00:33:59,890
Girl, will you stop bugging me?

957
00:34:02,926 --> 00:34:04,795
Khianna.

958
00:34:06,430 --> 00:34:07,631
Eyyy!

959
00:34:10,634 --> 00:34:11,668
This

960
00:34:11,668 --> 00:34:13,137
is the mane attraction.

961
00:34:13,137 --> 00:34:13,804
Ah, yeah.

962
00:34:13,804 --> 00:34:16,206
Literally, the mane.

963
00:34:16,473 --> 00:34:18,709
In this Runway, I am

964
00:34:18,709 --> 00:34:20,144
Arimaonga.

965
00:34:20,444 --> 00:34:22,980
And I am the lion-like creature,

966
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:24,014
I'm a goddess

967
00:34:24,014 --> 00:34:25,983
known as the moon eater,

968
00:34:25,983 --> 00:34:28,886
the cause of the lunar eclipse.

969
00:34:28,952 --> 00:34:30,888
You didn't know?

970
00:34:30,988 --> 00:34:32,222
Now you know.

971
00:34:32,222 --> 00:34:34,024
With a K.

972
00:34:37,461 --> 00:34:39,396
Eyyy!

973
00:34:42,266 --> 00:34:43,634
Yuhua.

974
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:46,069
I am giving you white lion, baby.

975
00:34:46,103 --> 00:34:47,971
I am white from head to toe!

976
00:34:48,005 --> 00:34:48,872
The wig,

977
00:34:48,872 --> 00:34:51,508
the outfit, the fur, the feathers, the train.

978
00:34:51,542 --> 00:34:53,577
Baby, I am feeling it.

979
00:34:53,610 --> 00:34:55,045
I'm wiggling myself

980
00:34:55,045 --> 00:34:55,879
like the wings.

981
00:34:55,879 --> 00:34:58,649
I'm giving you screams!

982
00:35:00,484 --> 00:35:02,085
What's up?

983
00:35:02,286 --> 00:35:03,921
Nothing. Just lion around.

984
00:35:07,191 --> 00:35:08,859
Viñas DeLuxe.

985
00:35:09,259 --> 00:35:11,295
Oh, my God!

986
00:35:12,629 --> 00:35:14,064
Wow!

987
00:35:14,097 --> 00:35:16,934
Oh, my God!

988
00:35:19,536 --> 00:35:22,606
- Fuck you, I'm gagging!
- I'm gooped, Viñas!

989
00:35:22,739 --> 00:35:24,641
Over!

990
00:35:24,675 --> 00:35:26,376
Over!

991
00:35:30,781 --> 00:35:33,717
Re-arrange and clear the path for it's on its way—

992
00:35:33,717 --> 00:35:36,320
the Gnome of Feng Shui!

993
00:35:36,386 --> 00:35:38,989
Not just a forest guardian,

994
00:35:39,022 --> 00:35:39,923
but

995
00:35:39,923 --> 00:35:42,993
an interior designer also. Kidding!

996
00:35:55,906 --> 00:35:57,341
Welcome, Queens!

997
00:35:57,407 --> 00:35:58,442
Now it's time to see your

998
00:35:58,442 --> 00:36:00,877
Snatch Elections campaign videos

999
00:36:00,877 --> 00:36:02,946
and the critiques, after.

1000
00:36:03,046 --> 00:36:04,781
Quick reminder, Queens.

1001
00:36:04,848 --> 00:36:06,984
Drag Race Philippines' regular rules

1002
00:36:06,984 --> 00:36:09,820
are still suspended as of this moment.

1003
00:36:09,886 --> 00:36:12,055
Because there are only seven of you in the competition,

1004
00:36:12,055 --> 00:36:13,824
all of you will be critiqued.

1005
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:15,359
Let's start off with...

1006
00:36:15,392 --> 00:36:16,526
Arizona Brandy

1007
00:36:16,526 --> 00:36:17,861
as the viral talent promoter,

1008
00:36:17,894 --> 00:36:20,497
Lynn from Las Vegas.

1009
00:36:21,231 --> 00:36:24,234
Hi! I'm Lynn from Las Vegas

1010
00:36:25,736 --> 00:36:26,637
Models.

1011
00:36:26,937 --> 00:36:28,639
I'm not just a model,

1012
00:36:28,639 --> 00:36:31,008
I'm the next president

1013
00:36:31,341 --> 00:36:33,043
of the Philippines.

1014
00:36:33,076 --> 00:36:35,779
Are you 18 and above

1015
00:36:37,147 --> 00:36:38,515
years old?

1016
00:36:38,682 --> 00:36:41,151
Are you a registered voter?

1017
00:36:41,184 --> 00:36:42,653
If not,

1018
00:36:42,686 --> 00:36:43,720
fuck off!

1019
00:36:43,754 --> 00:36:44,955
If so,

1020
00:36:44,955 --> 00:36:46,390
this opportunity

1021
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:47,391
may be

1022
00:36:47,424 --> 00:36:48,525
for you.

1023
00:36:48,792 --> 00:36:50,794
What are my platforms?

1024
00:36:50,994 --> 00:36:53,196
These are my platforms.

1025
00:36:53,196 --> 00:36:55,766
The first platform is bright,

1026
00:36:55,799 --> 00:36:57,634
just like your future

1027
00:36:58,402 --> 00:36:59,369
with me.

1028
00:37:00,337 --> 00:37:02,539
The next platform is clear,

1029
00:37:02,673 --> 00:37:05,075
just like my intentions

1030
00:37:05,509 --> 00:37:06,710
for you.

1031
00:37:06,743 --> 00:37:08,745
The next platform is...

1032
00:37:08,745 --> 00:37:09,913
orange.

1033
00:37:09,946 --> 00:37:10,480
Duh!

1034
00:37:10,881 --> 00:37:12,516
This is not even a platform.

1035
00:37:12,516 --> 00:37:13,383
Fuck off!

1036
00:37:13,517 --> 00:37:15,185
Do you like my platform?

1037
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:17,454
Thanks.

1038
00:37:17,454 --> 00:37:19,323
It's time for the world to know

1039
00:37:19,323 --> 00:37:21,692
that Filipinos are world-class

1040
00:37:21,692 --> 00:37:24,294
and have a pleasing personality.

1041
00:37:24,328 --> 00:37:25,729
A vote for Lynn

1042
00:37:25,796 --> 00:37:27,764
is a vote for an exciting

1043
00:37:27,864 --> 00:37:28,832
new life.

1044
00:37:30,767 --> 00:37:31,501
Thanks.

1045
00:37:31,868 --> 00:37:36,340
New Pilipinas, with Lynn from Las Vegas

1046
00:37:36,473 --> 00:37:37,874
Models.

1047
00:37:39,042 --> 00:37:40,043
Thanks.

1048
00:37:41,011 --> 00:37:41,745
Fuck off!
Oh. Fuck off.

1049
00:37:43,513 --> 00:37:46,950
- Yas!
- Oh, my God!

1050
00:37:47,317 --> 00:37:48,819
Arizona Brandy,

1051
00:37:49,453 --> 00:37:52,289
condragulations on your awesome video.

1052
00:37:52,356 --> 00:37:54,891
It was hilarious.

1053
00:37:54,925 --> 00:37:56,827
You really looked like the girl

1054
00:37:56,827 --> 00:37:58,695
- in the original video.
- Yeah.

1055
00:37:58,729 --> 00:38:00,697
You have the timing, I love the hair whip,

1056
00:38:00,697 --> 00:38:03,200
I love that you were standing in front of a Christmas tree

1057
00:38:03,467 --> 00:38:05,569
with two go-go boys Pit Crew.

1058
00:38:05,602 --> 00:38:07,838
And also, I loved your platforms,

1059
00:38:07,871 --> 00:38:09,272
literally,

1060
00:38:09,272 --> 00:38:11,808
and I will surely vote for you.

1061
00:38:12,109 --> 00:38:14,077
However,

1062
00:38:14,077 --> 00:38:15,612
with this Runway,

1063
00:38:15,645 --> 00:38:18,014
the back dress is kind of disconnected

1064
00:38:18,014 --> 00:38:19,583
with your catsuit.

1065
00:38:19,583 --> 00:38:20,984
It's a little ill-fitting,

1066
00:38:21,017 --> 00:38:22,552
closer to the shoe.

1067
00:38:22,619 --> 00:38:24,788
I think you could have tightened that up just a little bit.

1068
00:38:24,821 --> 00:38:28,225
Yeah, this Runway is kind of underwhelming.

1069
00:38:28,392 --> 00:38:31,261
I can only see the claws, the tongue, and your

1070
00:38:31,328 --> 00:38:32,062
bodysuit.

1071
00:38:32,062 --> 00:38:34,097
- Thank you, Arizona.
- Thank you.

1072
00:38:34,197 --> 00:38:34,831
Next,

1073
00:38:34,965 --> 00:38:36,199
Siam Phusri

1074
00:38:36,233 --> 00:38:38,168
as Thai rapper and singer,

1075
00:38:38,168 --> 00:38:40,036
Lisa of Blackpink.

1076
00:38:45,909 --> 00:38:47,144
“Look” is here.

1077
00:38:47,577 --> 00:38:48,645
No

1078
00:38:48,645 --> 00:38:49,146
more

1079
00:38:49,413 --> 00:38:51,014
fear.

1080
00:38:51,248 --> 00:38:53,083
If I am the president,

1081
00:38:54,151 --> 00:38:56,153
free meditation center

1082
00:38:56,186 --> 00:38:57,621
in every city

1083
00:38:57,621 --> 00:38:59,256
with monkeys and trees.

1084
00:38:59,289 --> 00:39:01,792
Because this is how I taught American people

1085
00:39:01,792 --> 00:39:03,193
meditation

1086
00:39:03,193 --> 00:39:04,828
with monkeys and trees.

1087
00:39:04,828 --> 00:39:06,062
And they love it.

1088
00:39:06,096 --> 00:39:08,265
Breathe in.

1089
00:39:08,265 --> 00:39:10,600
Breathe out.

1090
00:39:11,001 --> 00:39:13,970
Free mango sticky rice every Friday

1091
00:39:13,970 --> 00:39:16,740
while you're watching RuPaul's Drag Race.

1092
00:39:18,108 --> 00:39:21,211
Cancel all tech and luxury brands,

1093
00:39:21,244 --> 00:39:24,314
except for the ones that I am, an Ambassador for.

1094
00:39:25,215 --> 00:39:26,850
You guys should hire me

1095
00:39:26,850 --> 00:39:29,119
because you're going to get a lot of money after that.

1096
00:39:31,388 --> 00:39:33,690
Dear rockstar people,

1097
00:39:33,690 --> 00:39:35,292
I will replace

1098
00:39:35,292 --> 00:39:37,527
drama with astrology,

1099
00:39:37,527 --> 00:39:39,262
gossip with gold.

1100
00:39:39,262 --> 00:39:41,031
No more secrets!

1101
00:39:41,064 --> 00:39:41,631
Unless
they are

1102
00:39:42,833 --> 00:39:43,667
mine!

1103
00:39:44,134 --> 00:39:45,502
Vote for Look,

1104
00:39:45,502 --> 00:39:48,138
and make us born

1105
00:39:48,138 --> 00:39:49,139
again.

1106
00:39:59,516 --> 00:40:00,750
There was no

1107
00:40:00,784 --> 00:40:03,220
Lisa in that fucking shit.

1108
00:40:04,254 --> 00:40:06,656
- Mabuhay, Siam!
- Mabuhay!

1109
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:08,658
Let me start with your Runway.

1110
00:40:08,992 --> 00:40:10,260
I love it. You look like

1111
00:40:10,293 --> 00:40:11,595
a futuristic

1112
00:40:11,628 --> 00:40:13,530
mythical creature.

1113
00:40:13,563 --> 00:40:15,999
But on your campaign video,

1114
00:40:16,032 --> 00:40:18,535
it kind of fell flat for me.

1115
00:40:18,568 --> 00:40:20,036
You're portraying Lisa, right?

1116
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:21,171
Of Blackpink.

1117
00:40:21,204 --> 00:40:23,840
It didn't quite give me that Lisa vibe.

1118
00:40:23,874 --> 00:40:26,443
You are a funny, funny queen.

1119
00:40:26,476 --> 00:40:29,546
I don't know if it read in the video as much.

1120
00:40:29,579 --> 00:40:31,848
It was such a beautiful,

1121
00:40:31,848 --> 00:40:34,050
chaotic disaster.

1122
00:40:34,484 --> 00:40:37,020
In the sense of like, I didn't really know

1123
00:40:37,087 --> 00:40:38,355
what I was kind of watching

1124
00:40:38,355 --> 00:40:40,423
and I think I kind of liked some of that.

1125
00:40:40,957 --> 00:40:42,759
Thank you, Siam Phusri.

1126
00:40:42,826 --> 00:40:43,827
Thank you.

1127
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:45,595
Next, we have Brigiding

1128
00:40:45,896 --> 00:40:48,064
as Nobel Laureate

1129
00:40:48,064 --> 00:40:50,400
and journalist, Maria Ressa.

1130
00:40:54,137 --> 00:40:56,540
I am Maria Ressa.

1131
00:40:56,673 --> 00:40:58,008
In this modern world

1132
00:40:58,041 --> 00:40:59,376
of social media

1133
00:40:59,376 --> 00:41:01,211
and exponential lies.

1134
00:41:02,178 --> 00:41:04,347
EXPONENTIAL?!

1135
00:41:05,048 --> 00:41:06,650
I have a confession.

1136
00:41:07,217 --> 00:41:08,084
I

1137
00:41:08,084 --> 00:41:09,886
am LGBT.

1138
00:41:11,021 --> 00:41:13,223
Looking Gorgeous But Tired

1139
00:41:13,223 --> 00:41:15,592
I am sick and tired of BUTT.

1140
00:41:17,127 --> 00:41:17,594
Butt?

1141
00:41:18,161 --> 00:41:18,962
Bullshit.

1142
00:41:19,229 --> 00:41:20,797
Unapologetic.

1143
00:41:21,231 --> 00:41:22,365
Tool.

1144
00:41:23,066 --> 00:41:24,167
Trolls.

1145
00:41:24,868 --> 00:41:25,835
We don't need

1146
00:41:25,835 --> 00:41:27,003
a dictator.

1147
00:41:28,338 --> 00:41:30,040
What we need,

1148
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,841
is a president with TITE.
(Filipino word for penis)

1149
00:41:32,542 --> 00:41:33,610
TITE.

1150
00:41:34,077 --> 00:41:35,245
Truth.

1151
00:41:35,278 --> 00:41:36,846
Integrity.

1152
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,481
Transparency.

1153
00:41:38,481 --> 00:41:40,350
Equality.

1154
00:41:40,350 --> 00:41:41,217
TITE.

1155
00:41:41,585 --> 00:41:43,186
Maria Ressa.

1156
00:41:43,186 --> 00:41:44,321
Journalist.

1157
00:41:44,321 --> 00:41:46,156
Time Magazine Person of the Year.

1158
00:41:46,623 --> 00:41:49,125
Nobel Peace Prize Laureate.

1159
00:41:49,125 --> 00:41:51,027
My opponents could never.

1160
00:41:51,394 --> 00:41:54,064
Maria Ressa, vote for me now!

1161
00:41:54,064 --> 00:41:55,832
This election I’ll give

1162
00:41:55,832 --> 00:41:58,568
award-winning beauty and brains

1163
00:41:58,568 --> 00:41:59,302
Maria Ressa.

1164
00:41:59,536 --> 00:42:00,637
Will stand for what’s right,

1165
00:42:00,837 --> 00:42:02,138
will strike down corruption,

1166
00:42:02,138 --> 00:42:03,406
will rise as the people’s pride.

1167
00:42:03,406 --> 00:42:05,241
Vote Maria Ressa,

1168
00:42:05,241 --> 00:42:06,376
the president with TITE.

1169
00:42:06,409 --> 00:42:10,113
Tite, Tite, Tite, Tite, Tite!

1170
00:42:10,146 --> 00:42:10,981
This ad is paid

1171
00:42:11,014 --> 00:42:12,849
by the Fingers Association of the Philippines.

1172
00:42:16,086 --> 00:42:18,288
Wow, Brigiding!

1173
00:42:18,755 --> 00:42:19,823
I love it!

1174
00:42:19,823 --> 00:42:21,958
Brigiding, Brigiding, Brigiding.

1175
00:42:21,992 --> 00:42:24,127
You definitely understood the assignment.

1176
00:42:24,694 --> 00:42:27,130
From the minute you walked to the podium,

1177
00:42:27,530 --> 00:42:29,399
I was already laughing.

1178
00:42:29,399 --> 00:42:32,402
And what I think you mastered in this

1179
00:42:32,435 --> 00:42:34,638
video, this one-minute campaign,

1180
00:42:34,871 --> 00:42:37,407
is physical comedy at its finest.

1181
00:42:37,774 --> 00:42:38,975
Home run.

1182
00:42:39,075 --> 00:42:41,244
What a Rudemption, huh?

1183
00:42:41,244 --> 00:42:43,913
From your last season's Snatch Game.

1184
00:42:44,014 --> 00:42:45,548
And with this look...

1185
00:42:46,116 --> 00:42:46,783
Wow!

1186
00:42:47,584 --> 00:42:48,985
I loved it.

1187
00:42:49,219 --> 00:42:51,421
The presentation, the concept,

1188
00:42:51,421 --> 00:42:53,723
and you're so fierce in this.

1189
00:42:53,723 --> 00:42:56,359
Congratulations, Brigiding. Congrats.

1190
00:42:56,426 --> 00:42:58,795
- Why are you so emotional?
- Why are you crying?

1191
00:42:58,795 --> 00:43:00,163
I am overwhelmed.

1192
00:43:02,599 --> 00:43:04,467
For the whole competition, I've been

1193
00:43:04,501 --> 00:43:05,635
at the top,

1194
00:43:05,669 --> 00:43:08,004
but I think this is the time where

1195
00:43:08,004 --> 00:43:09,205
it's all hitting me.

1196
00:43:10,206 --> 00:43:12,409
I am fully realizing

1197
00:43:12,409 --> 00:43:13,910
what I can really do.

1198
00:43:14,277 --> 00:43:16,880
From being so fearful,

1199
00:43:16,946 --> 00:43:18,448
from being so ashamed,

1200
00:43:18,448 --> 00:43:20,150
from being so

1201
00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:21,818
depressed from my season,

1202
00:43:21,851 --> 00:43:23,687
I just feel so proud that

1203
00:43:23,687 --> 00:43:25,488
this is me, I could do it.

1204
00:43:25,522 --> 00:43:27,190
I am reminded of who I am.

1205
00:43:27,223 --> 00:43:29,225
So, thank you so much for appreciating it.

1206
00:43:29,225 --> 00:43:30,527
Condragulations.

1207
00:43:31,561 --> 00:43:33,563
Next up, Suki Doll,

1208
00:43:33,563 --> 00:43:34,831
as a Mexican-Chinese

1209
00:43:34,864 --> 00:43:37,634
actress and exotic dancer,

1210
00:43:37,634 --> 00:43:39,302
Lyn May.

1211
00:43:46,376 --> 00:43:47,243
Down with the suits

1212
00:43:47,243 --> 00:43:48,311
and down with the ties.

1213
00:43:48,311 --> 00:43:50,780
And strut high heels and world-class thighs.

1214
00:43:51,181 --> 00:43:53,249
So vote Lyn May, it's clear to see

1215
00:43:53,316 --> 00:43:55,685
She's a sex icon who will set you free.

1216
00:43:56,119 --> 00:43:59,089
It's me, Lyn May.

1217
00:43:59,089 --> 00:44:01,324
Your goddess of love.

1218
00:44:01,691 --> 00:44:05,829
Mexico's Nicki Minaj, telling you

1219
00:44:05,829 --> 00:44:07,430
I promise here,

1220
00:44:07,430 --> 00:44:09,799
no more taxes!

1221
00:44:09,799 --> 00:44:12,902
Just kisses for everyone

1222
00:44:13,169 --> 00:44:16,139
and sequined thigh-high boots.

1223
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:20,877
Replace the army of boys

1224
00:44:20,910 --> 00:44:23,480
with strippers!

1225
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:26,149
Look, we dance!

1226
00:44:26,182 --> 00:44:27,784
Vote for me

1227
00:44:27,784 --> 00:44:31,154
and I'll make presidential love to you.

1228
00:44:31,588 --> 00:44:35,024
Deliberate it and with sex

1229
00:44:35,024 --> 00:44:36,326
Let's dance!

1230
00:44:36,326 --> 00:44:36,826
WARNING!

1231
00:44:36,826 --> 00:44:38,328
Voting for Lyn May may cause excessive swooning,

1232
00:44:38,328 --> 00:44:40,630
spontaneous dance parties and sudden increase in fabulousness.

1233
00:44:40,630 --> 00:44:42,198
Side effects includes overwhelming confidence,

1234
00:44:42,198 --> 00:44:43,032
slight intoxication,

1235
00:44:43,032 --> 00:44:44,134
and an urge to wear sequins.

1236
00:44:44,134 --> 00:44:45,068
Vote reponsibly
or don't!

1237
00:44:45,535 --> 00:44:46,703
Either way, you'll be entertained.

1238
00:44:54,611 --> 00:44:57,046
- Yas!
- Suki Doll.

1239
00:44:57,046 --> 00:44:58,715
I was just like smiling

1240
00:44:58,715 --> 00:45:00,683
the whole time watching your video.

1241
00:45:01,050 --> 00:45:02,886
Just looking at your character,

1242
00:45:02,919 --> 00:45:04,254
you know the character was there,

1243
00:45:04,487 --> 00:45:05,955
and it was a bit funny, not

1244
00:45:05,989 --> 00:45:08,558
totally, but a bit funny and that's okay.

1245
00:45:08,558 --> 00:45:11,060
I think you could've taken it a bit further

1246
00:45:11,094 --> 00:45:12,295
with this character.

1247
00:45:12,295 --> 00:45:14,464
I was ready for you to swing around on a pole,

1248
00:45:15,031 --> 00:45:17,167
and beg for the votes on your knees.

1249
00:45:17,767 --> 00:45:18,635
I think next time

1250
00:45:18,668 --> 00:45:21,304
and the next challenge and the next opportunity you get

1251
00:45:21,304 --> 00:45:23,173
to show a different side of Suki

1252
00:45:23,373 --> 00:45:24,741
that's on the same level

1253
00:45:24,741 --> 00:45:28,178
as the Runway package you are presenting on this Main Stage

1254
00:45:28,178 --> 00:45:30,246
I mean it's whimsical, it's magical

1255
00:45:30,246 --> 00:45:32,682
it's mystical, theatrical.

1256
00:45:32,715 --> 00:45:35,585
You know how to deliver drag at its finest.

1257
00:45:35,885 --> 00:45:38,521
- Congratulations.
- Thank you, thank you.

1258
00:45:38,555 --> 00:45:40,957
Congratulations Suki, thank you.

1259
00:45:40,957 --> 00:45:42,058
Thank you.

1260
00:45:42,091 --> 00:45:42,826
Next up,

1261
00:45:42,859 --> 00:45:45,228
Khianna as viral social media personality,

1262
00:45:45,261 --> 00:45:46,763
Mommy Toni Fowler.

1263
00:45:47,430 --> 00:45:49,899
Hello, my besties, I am Toni Fowler.

1264
00:45:49,899 --> 00:45:52,735
Most of them look at me and think I'm a walker.

1265
00:45:55,071 --> 00:45:56,072
Oh, fuck.

1266
00:45:56,105 --> 00:45:57,173
Can you handle that, besties?

1267
00:45:57,173 --> 00:45:57,941
I'm going to run.
Ah, daddy!

1268
00:45:58,908 --> 00:45:59,442
Daddy!

1269
00:45:59,442 --> 00:46:01,511
I am known for being a mother.

1270
00:46:01,511 --> 00:46:02,679
In Tagalog,

1271
00:46:02,679 --> 00:46:03,680
ina ka.

1272
00:46:03,980 --> 00:46:05,815
Motherfucking bitch.

1273
00:46:05,915 --> 00:46:07,317
I have prepared many platforms,

1274
00:46:07,350 --> 00:46:10,086
and promises I want to tell of you.

1275
00:46:10,119 --> 00:46:11,788
There's free birthing facilities.

1276
00:46:13,723 --> 00:46:15,024
Free enhancement surgeries.

1277
00:46:16,893 --> 00:46:18,461
Sex education.

1278
00:46:18,494 --> 00:46:19,462
In Tagalog,

1279
00:46:19,462 --> 00:46:20,897
let's go straight to fucking!

1280
00:46:22,632 --> 00:46:24,601
And most importantly,

1281
00:46:24,601 --> 00:46:26,102
to end world hunger.

1282
00:46:26,135 --> 00:46:27,270
That is why

1283
00:46:27,270 --> 00:46:29,973
there's free fine dining restaurants for everyone!

1284
00:46:30,006 --> 00:46:30,773
Slay.

1285
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:31,941
For you,

1286
00:46:31,941 --> 00:46:32,842
and you,

1287
00:46:32,876 --> 00:46:34,043
fuck you.

1288
00:46:34,043 --> 00:46:36,112
I vow, to all of you,

1289
00:46:36,145 --> 00:46:38,314
food will always be available.

1290
00:46:39,148 --> 00:46:40,316
Because when you have nothing in your gut,

1291
00:46:40,316 --> 00:46:41,684
your nips will smell like butt.

1292
00:46:41,684 --> 00:46:43,720
And besties, I also promise,

1293
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:46,656
to sew each and every promise I made.

1294
00:46:46,890 --> 00:46:48,324
As tight as the ones in my pussy.

1295
00:46:49,058 --> 00:46:50,827
She's your mommy,

1296
00:46:50,860 --> 00:46:52,061
everyone's mommy,

1297
00:46:52,061 --> 00:46:53,363
the generous mommy,

1298
00:46:53,363 --> 00:46:54,664
and the finger mommy.

1299
00:46:54,898 --> 00:46:57,233
So choose, motherfucking wisely.

1300
00:46:57,233 --> 00:46:59,969
Vote Mommy Oni, Followher.

1301
00:47:00,003 --> 00:47:02,639
Vote for me, like a dick that's zesty!

1302
00:47:03,306 --> 00:47:06,342
Come on, come on, come on, vote for me.

1303
00:47:11,714 --> 00:47:12,615
Alright, Khianna,

1304
00:47:12,615 --> 00:47:14,450
we have another big-breasted

1305
00:47:14,450 --> 00:47:15,919
stripper in the house.

1306
00:47:16,786 --> 00:47:18,087
I think the concept

1307
00:47:18,121 --> 00:47:20,456
of the campaign video was clever.

1308
00:47:20,490 --> 00:47:22,191
And I think as the video went on,

1309
00:47:22,225 --> 00:47:23,259
there were some bits

1310
00:47:23,259 --> 00:47:24,928
that I kind of giggled at.

1311
00:47:24,961 --> 00:47:26,329
It's a campaign video,

1312
00:47:26,329 --> 00:47:27,697
so you should convince

1313
00:47:27,697 --> 00:47:29,032
the people to vote you.

1314
00:47:29,065 --> 00:47:31,234
But I didn't feel that.

1315
00:47:31,467 --> 00:47:33,269
There's no convincing power.

1316
00:47:33,269 --> 00:47:35,972
And it kind of fell flat also.

1317
00:47:36,005 --> 00:47:37,573
It's not that funny.

1318
00:47:37,607 --> 00:47:39,242
But with this look, I love it.

1319
00:47:39,275 --> 00:47:41,344
You look so gorgeous.

1320
00:47:41,377 --> 00:47:43,346
The mug is mugging.

1321
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:46,516
But I love this more

1322
00:47:46,549 --> 00:47:49,385
without the other feet.

1323
00:47:49,485 --> 00:47:51,120
Try to edit your look.

1324
00:47:51,321 --> 00:47:52,488
Make sure it won't look

1325
00:47:52,488 --> 00:47:53,890
like a stuffed toy.

1326
00:47:53,890 --> 00:47:55,725
It is a strong look but

1327
00:47:55,825 --> 00:47:56,993
it's a whole lot.

1328
00:47:57,260 --> 00:47:58,695
And I will say it,

1329
00:47:58,695 --> 00:48:00,096
I've already seen that.

1330
00:48:00,096 --> 00:48:02,231
Of course, we search for different looks.

1331
00:48:02,231 --> 00:48:03,599
We have our references.

1332
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:05,401
There's nothing wrong with that, Khianna.

1333
00:48:05,401 --> 00:48:06,869
But you can make it your own.

1334
00:48:07,403 --> 00:48:08,571
That's all I'm saying.

1335
00:48:09,072 --> 00:48:10,473
Khianna got clocked,

1336
00:48:10,473 --> 00:48:11,407
award.

1337
00:48:12,241 --> 00:48:15,111
I'm sorry if I disappointed y’all guys.

1338
00:48:15,812 --> 00:48:16,879
I'm trying my hardest.

1339
00:48:16,879 --> 00:48:18,214
I'm trying my best.

1340
00:48:18,648 --> 00:48:21,384
Khianna, when I say

1341
00:48:21,818 --> 00:48:23,219
I've seen this look before,

1342
00:48:23,219 --> 00:48:24,754
I've seen it already.

1343
00:48:24,754 --> 00:48:26,956
I'm telling that to you,

1344
00:48:26,956 --> 00:48:29,492
not for you to doubt yourself.

1345
00:48:29,525 --> 00:48:30,326
I'm just saying that
so that you can

1346
00:48:31,361 --> 00:48:32,095
challenge yourself
and make it a little bit

1347
00:48:32,929 --> 00:48:34,097
different this time.

1348
00:48:34,097 --> 00:48:35,398
For variation.

1349
00:48:35,398 --> 00:48:36,733
I know you're a creative person.

1350
00:48:36,733 --> 00:48:38,234
See, you conceptualized that,

1351
00:48:38,234 --> 00:48:39,102
you designed that.

1352
00:48:39,135 --> 00:48:40,269
You have that in you.

1353
00:48:40,303 --> 00:48:41,704
So help yourself.

1354
00:48:41,771 --> 00:48:43,439
And conquer your inner saboteur

1355
00:48:43,473 --> 00:48:45,274
to win this competition.

1356
00:48:45,408 --> 00:48:46,776
Thank you, Khianna.

1357
00:48:46,843 --> 00:48:47,510
Thank you.
Next,

1358
00:48:48,277 --> 00:48:51,848
Yuhua as con artist Anna Delvey.

1359
00:48:53,282 --> 00:48:55,018
Hello, I'm Anna Delvey.

1360
00:48:55,051 --> 00:48:57,253
And this is my presidential plea—

1361
00:48:57,954 --> 00:48:58,755
campaign.

1362
00:48:59,255 --> 00:49:00,690
It will be very on brand

1363
00:49:00,690 --> 00:49:01,858
for me to be president.

1364
00:49:01,858 --> 00:49:04,160
because electing con artist right now

1365
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:05,661
is very popular.

1366
00:49:05,695 --> 00:49:07,764
Shout out to the USA!

1367
00:49:10,166 --> 00:49:10,700
Whoops!

1368
00:49:10,733 --> 00:49:13,369
Sorry, that is my ankle bracelet.

1369
00:49:13,536 --> 00:49:15,104
But don't you worry, baby.

1370
00:49:15,138 --> 00:49:16,406
I am a Republican.

1371
00:49:16,406 --> 00:49:18,875
So I have a loaded gun ready.

1372
00:49:20,176 --> 00:49:22,078
I vow to free our prisoners,

1373
00:49:22,078 --> 00:49:23,746
starting with myself.

1374
00:49:26,716 --> 00:49:28,551
I want the economy to be better,

1375
00:49:28,584 --> 00:49:31,087
that's why I'm giving every child a fake ID.

1376
00:49:33,656 --> 00:49:36,692
Hashtag cheap labor.

1377
00:49:37,026 --> 00:49:39,095
I believe education is key,

1378
00:49:39,128 --> 00:49:40,830
and that's why I'm releasing my book

1379
00:49:40,830 --> 00:49:43,332
to teach others how to scam properly,

1380
00:49:43,332 --> 00:49:44,700
The Road to FRAUD-DOM.

1381
00:49:45,001 --> 00:49:47,136
A.K.A Capitalism.

1382
00:49:47,336 --> 00:49:48,905
And you're probably wondering,

1383
00:49:49,005 --> 00:49:51,441
why is my accent so strange?

1384
00:49:51,607 --> 00:49:52,975
If I say I'm Chinese,

1385
00:49:53,009 --> 00:49:54,110
then I'm Chinese.

1386
00:49:54,143 --> 00:49:55,311
If I say I'm British,

1387
00:49:55,344 --> 00:49:56,245
then I'm British.

1388
00:49:56,245 --> 00:49:57,980
If I say I'm Russian,

1389
00:49:57,980 --> 00:50:00,383
then I'm motherfucking Russian.

1390
00:50:00,383 --> 00:50:02,985
Because I'm Anna fucking Delvey.

1391
00:50:03,152 --> 00:50:04,353
So vote for me,

1392
00:50:04,420 --> 00:50:05,288
or whatever.

1393
00:50:05,455 --> 00:50:07,757
We have Russian bots for that anyway.

1394
00:50:08,291 --> 00:50:09,292
Yay!

1395
00:50:10,359 --> 00:50:12,895
Hello, I'm Anna Delvey.

1396
00:50:12,929 --> 00:50:15,364
And this is my presidential plea—

1397
00:50:15,765 --> 00:50:16,732
campaign!

1398
00:50:17,233 --> 00:50:19,135
The road to FRAUD-DOM

1399
00:50:19,135 --> 00:50:21,337
is the only way.

1400
00:50:22,038 --> 00:50:24,273
- Yay!
- Oh, wow!

1401
00:50:24,574 --> 00:50:25,608
Yuhua.

1402
00:50:25,608 --> 00:50:27,009
Alright.

1403
00:50:27,043 --> 00:50:29,645
This video was comical.

1404
00:50:29,679 --> 00:50:32,315
It was clearly hysterical.

1405
00:50:32,315 --> 00:50:34,684
The bit was precise.

1406
00:50:34,684 --> 00:50:35,818
It was tight.

1407
00:50:35,818 --> 00:50:37,286
There was physical comedy.

1408
00:50:37,286 --> 00:50:38,454
Did you write all this?

1409
00:50:38,454 --> 00:50:39,422
Yes!

1410
00:50:39,422 --> 00:50:40,656
Genius.

1411
00:50:40,723 --> 00:50:42,959
I loved everything about this.

1412
00:50:42,959 --> 00:50:44,360
This is probably my

1413
00:50:44,427 --> 00:50:46,162
favorite video of the night.

1414
00:50:46,496 --> 00:50:47,864
I love the video.

1415
00:50:47,897 --> 00:50:49,298
It was so hilarious.

1416
00:50:49,332 --> 00:50:52,034
And I love the character choice.

1417
00:50:52,068 --> 00:50:54,203
It's so witty with the FRAUD-DOM.

1418
00:50:54,270 --> 00:50:55,638
Road to Fraud-dom.

1419
00:50:55,638 --> 00:50:56,973
Fraud-dom.

1420
00:50:57,006 --> 00:50:59,175
For sure the scammers will vote for you.

1421
00:51:00,710 --> 00:51:01,677
And your look,

1422
00:51:01,711 --> 00:51:03,980
it may not look like something

1423
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:05,515
that you will get right away,

1424
00:51:05,515 --> 00:51:06,549
but I love it.

1425
00:51:06,716 --> 00:51:07,783
Thank you, Yuhua.

1426
00:51:07,817 --> 00:51:09,619
Now, Viñas DeLuxe

1427
00:51:09,619 --> 00:51:11,754
as the Vice President of the Philippines,

1428
00:51:11,754 --> 00:51:13,689
Inday Sara Duterte.

1429
00:51:15,191 --> 00:51:17,193
I am Inday Sara.

1430
00:51:17,793 --> 00:51:18,628
Inday

1431
00:51:18,728 --> 00:51:19,795
am telling you,

1432
00:51:20,463 --> 00:51:21,731
I'm not going.

1433
00:51:22,698 --> 00:51:23,833
I am running

1434
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:26,002
from accountability

1435
00:51:26,502 --> 00:51:27,303
because...

1436
00:51:27,503 --> 00:51:29,071
I'm not an accountant.

1437
00:51:29,405 --> 00:51:31,207
I'm not here to smile and wave.

1438
00:51:31,374 --> 00:51:32,375
I'm here

1439
00:51:32,608 --> 00:51:33,309
to take

1440
00:51:33,709 --> 00:51:34,477
action!

1441
00:51:36,045 --> 00:51:37,747
Transparency is very,

1442
00:51:37,747 --> 00:51:39,482
very important to me.

1443
00:51:39,515 --> 00:51:40,616
That's why today,

1444
00:51:40,683 --> 00:51:43,286
I will reveal our budget.

1445
00:51:44,453 --> 00:51:46,055
Gao xing,

1446
00:51:46,055 --> 00:51:47,857
Shiminet,

1447
00:51:47,857 --> 00:51:49,625
Mai Poo Si,

1448
00:51:49,625 --> 00:51:50,927
is loose.

1449
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:52,261
In short,

1450
00:51:52,295 --> 00:51:53,763
that's confidential.

1451
00:51:54,463 --> 00:51:55,364
If I win,

1452
00:51:55,364 --> 00:51:56,465
I do not want

1453
00:51:56,465 --> 00:51:57,867
to be called president.

1454
00:51:57,900 --> 00:51:59,535
I want to be called

1455
00:51:59,535 --> 00:52:00,803
“Princess.”

1456
00:52:01,204 --> 00:52:02,338
Princess Sara.

1457
00:52:02,605 --> 00:52:04,574
Everyone gets potatoes for free,

1458
00:52:04,740 --> 00:52:07,009
personally peeled by me.

1459
00:52:07,210 --> 00:52:09,312
And if I don't win,

1460
00:52:09,512 --> 00:52:11,581
I'm sure you're a PINK!

1461
00:52:12,114 --> 00:52:13,983
Puck off
Idiots

1462
00:52:13,983 --> 00:52:14,884
Now
K?!

1463
00:52:16,586 --> 00:52:18,921
I am your VP BP Sara.

1464
00:52:18,921 --> 00:52:20,957
Her blood pressure is spiking.

1465
00:52:20,957 --> 00:52:21,724
Inday

1466
00:52:21,991 --> 00:52:23,392
will always love you.

1467
00:52:24,093 --> 00:52:25,595
Inday...

1468
00:52:27,029 --> 00:52:28,064
Am I impeached (in pitch)?

1469
00:52:35,271 --> 00:52:36,672
Viñas DeLuxe.

1470
00:52:36,939 --> 00:52:38,507
Your video is really funny.

1471
00:52:38,674 --> 00:52:40,876
I love the wit and the humor.

1472
00:52:40,876 --> 00:52:41,644
It's smart.

1473
00:52:41,644 --> 00:52:44,547
Now this is the Slaysian Royale

1474
00:52:44,847 --> 00:52:47,083
that I was hoping to see.

1475
00:52:47,650 --> 00:52:49,151
A combination of a

1476
00:52:49,151 --> 00:52:51,921
hilarious, funny video.

1477
00:52:52,221 --> 00:52:54,223
It was very minimalistic.

1478
00:52:54,523 --> 00:52:55,825
It was right to the point.

1479
00:52:55,825 --> 00:52:57,326
There was physical comedy.

1480
00:52:57,860 --> 00:52:59,028
But tonight,

1481
00:52:59,595 --> 00:53:00,696
I mean, come on.

1482
00:53:00,730 --> 00:53:02,265
Since you came out on the stage,

1483
00:53:02,265 --> 00:53:03,866
it's done, it's over.

1484
00:53:04,033 --> 00:53:05,434
Let's pack up.

1485
00:53:05,568 --> 00:53:07,336
This is mystical,

1486
00:53:07,336 --> 00:53:10,406
fantastical at its finest,

1487
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:11,941
gone drag.

1488
00:53:12,141 --> 00:53:14,744
The Slaysian Royale right here.

1489
00:53:14,744 --> 00:53:15,845
With this look, I love it.

1490
00:53:15,845 --> 00:53:17,013
This is what I'm saying.

1491
00:53:17,079 --> 00:53:18,281
You made it drag,

1492
00:53:18,281 --> 00:53:19,949
you played with it, and

1493
00:53:19,949 --> 00:53:22,251
it was so smart, so good.

1494
00:53:22,652 --> 00:53:24,754
You, to me, were the most consistent.

1495
00:53:25,221 --> 00:53:26,956
- Runway and video.
- Yes.

1496
00:53:26,956 --> 00:53:28,524
Thank you!

1497
00:53:28,958 --> 00:53:30,626
Alright, thank you Alyssa.

1498
00:53:31,227 --> 00:53:32,795
After the judges' critiques,

1499
00:53:32,995 --> 00:53:35,231
we have made some decisions.

1500
00:53:36,766 --> 00:53:38,401
Arizona Brandy.

1501
00:53:41,137 --> 00:53:42,405
Suki Doll.

1502
00:53:45,308 --> 00:53:47,643
You two are safe.

1503
00:53:51,447 --> 00:53:53,316
Viñas DeLuxe,

1504
00:53:55,985 --> 00:53:56,852
Brigiding.

1505
00:53:59,388 --> 00:54:01,190
Condragulations, Queens.

1506
00:54:01,190 --> 00:54:03,726
You are the Top 2 Slaysians of the week.

1507
00:54:03,859 --> 00:54:05,461
Oh, my God!

1508
00:54:06,295 --> 00:54:07,496
I'm so happy, like

1509
00:54:07,530 --> 00:54:09,065
this episode?

1510
00:54:09,432 --> 00:54:10,433
Me?

1511
00:54:10,466 --> 00:54:11,934
Snatch Elections?

1512
00:54:12,034 --> 00:54:14,036
I'm so great!

1513
00:54:14,036 --> 00:54:15,971
I’m a winner!

1514
00:54:16,005 --> 00:54:16,939
My God!

1515
00:54:18,107 --> 00:54:20,242
Yuhua.

1516
00:54:21,310 --> 00:54:23,045
Condragulations.

1517
00:54:23,079 --> 00:54:24,814
You are also on top

1518
00:54:24,814 --> 00:54:26,282
this week.

1519
00:54:26,282 --> 00:54:27,783
My name is called too?

1520
00:54:28,150 --> 00:54:29,085
What the fuck?

1521
00:54:29,085 --> 00:54:30,553
What the fuck is going on

1522
00:54:30,553 --> 00:54:31,987
in Slaysian Royale?

1523
00:54:32,388 --> 00:54:33,055
Yes.

1524
00:54:33,289 --> 00:54:34,657
You heard it right.

1525
00:54:35,091 --> 00:54:37,727
We have a Top 3 this week.

1526
00:54:37,860 --> 00:54:39,128
Wow!

1527
00:54:39,128 --> 00:54:40,429
Wait, I'm confused. What?

1528
00:54:41,163 --> 00:54:42,098
What happened?

1529
00:54:42,098 --> 00:54:43,432
This is mine and Viñas' moment.

1530
00:54:43,432 --> 00:54:45,368
Now Yuhua's the third wheel.

1531
00:54:45,568 --> 00:54:46,335
Sigh.

1532
00:54:46,769 --> 00:54:48,904
Which means Siam Phusri,

1533
00:54:48,971 --> 00:54:50,406
Khianna,

1534
00:54:50,439 --> 00:54:52,641
you are the Bottom 2 this week.

1535
00:54:55,044 --> 00:54:58,080
Viñas DeLuxe, Brigiding, and Yuhua.

1536
00:54:58,347 --> 00:55:00,049
Each of you will have to decide

1537
00:55:00,049 --> 00:55:01,984
which of the Bottom queens

1538
00:55:02,418 --> 00:55:03,986
you choose to eliminate

1539
00:55:04,019 --> 00:55:06,222
if you win the lip sync.

1540
00:55:06,655 --> 00:55:08,357
So while you Queens deliberate

1541
00:55:08,391 --> 00:55:10,226
and untuck in the Werkroom,

1542
00:55:10,259 --> 00:55:12,461
the judges and I will be playing

1543
00:55:12,495 --> 00:55:14,797
Pinoy Genius Yarn.

1544
00:55:16,098 --> 00:55:19,034
Queens, you may leave the stage and evaporate.

1545
00:55:35,050 --> 00:55:36,419
Oh, my God!

1546
00:55:36,419 --> 00:55:38,287
Can you imagine?

1547
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:39,688
Brigiding!

1548
00:55:39,722 --> 00:55:41,323
- Ding, Ding, Ding!
- Viñas!

1549
00:55:41,357 --> 00:55:43,692
- Congratulations!
- Top 3!

1550
00:55:43,692 --> 00:55:44,794
I know!

1551
00:55:45,094 --> 00:55:46,796
Baby, we are walking back

1552
00:55:46,796 --> 00:55:47,663
into the Werkroom.

1553
00:55:47,663 --> 00:55:49,031
We got Viñas, we got Brigiding,

1554
00:55:49,031 --> 00:55:50,766
we got me in the Top 3.

1555
00:55:50,766 --> 00:55:52,735
Siam and Khianna are in the bottom

1556
00:55:52,735 --> 00:55:54,003
and it kind of makes sense.

1557
00:55:54,003 --> 00:55:55,771
I mean, I didn't laugh at all.

1558
00:55:56,071 --> 00:55:57,440
Khianna, how are you?

1559
00:55:57,440 --> 00:55:58,174
How are you feeling?

1560
00:55:58,174 --> 00:55:59,642
You were very emotional earlier.

1561
00:55:59,642 --> 00:56:00,910
Yeah.

1562
00:56:01,777 --> 00:56:05,548
I don't really know exactly what to feel.

1563
00:56:06,148 --> 00:56:06,849
Because at this point,

1564
00:56:06,882 --> 00:56:08,050
I'm very,

1565
00:56:09,118 --> 00:56:10,419
very tired.

1566
00:56:10,853 --> 00:56:12,621
And I don't know what to feel.

1567
00:56:13,088 --> 00:56:15,691
And I'm also sorry because I think

1568
00:56:17,326 --> 00:56:21,530
I am such a disappointment for everyone.

1569
00:56:23,032 --> 00:56:24,133
I feel like

1570
00:56:26,168 --> 00:56:27,570
I'm finding myself.

1571
00:56:28,404 --> 00:56:29,972
I'm finding that old Khianna

1572
00:56:29,972 --> 00:56:31,307
that I saw last year.

1573
00:56:31,907 --> 00:56:34,343
And she's not here with us.

1574
00:56:34,477 --> 00:56:36,078
You know, I just wanted to see the Khianna

1575
00:56:36,078 --> 00:56:37,513
that I was before.

1576
00:56:37,913 --> 00:56:39,949
Like, anything I wear,

1577
00:56:39,949 --> 00:56:41,617
any challenges,

1578
00:56:41,617 --> 00:56:43,385
I was enjoying it, I was fighting.

1579
00:56:43,819 --> 00:56:45,287
Like, just doing the most.

1580
00:56:45,287 --> 00:56:48,123
And now, I'm just overthinking everything so,

1581
00:56:48,224 --> 00:56:49,859
I don't know what else to do.

1582
00:56:51,961 --> 00:56:53,929
So, if you want to choose my lipstick,

1583
00:56:53,929 --> 00:56:54,930
I'm good with it.

1584
00:56:58,434 --> 00:57:00,169
I'm just so fucking tired.

1585
00:57:02,938 --> 00:57:04,573
I'm such a failure.

1586
00:57:04,740 --> 00:57:06,675
You're not a failure, baby.

1587
00:57:06,976 --> 00:57:07,877
Girl.

1588
00:57:11,780 --> 00:57:13,249
I want to go home.

1589
00:57:13,516 --> 00:57:15,284
No. Don’t.

1590
00:57:15,851 --> 00:57:17,386
I'm sorry, I'm giving up.

1591
00:57:17,586 --> 00:57:18,787
I don't know what's happening.

1592
00:57:20,022 --> 00:57:22,625
I'm so sorry, everyone.

1593
00:57:22,825 --> 00:57:23,993
I don't know. I just...

1594
00:57:23,993 --> 00:57:24,860
felt like...

1595
00:57:24,860 --> 00:57:26,328
so defeated.

1596
00:57:29,164 --> 00:57:30,666
I think I want to go home.

1597
00:57:32,868 --> 00:57:34,270
Bitch, don't quit.

1598
00:57:34,303 --> 00:57:35,938
Girl, don't be stupid.

1599
00:57:35,938 --> 00:57:37,740
I want to go home, please.

1600
00:57:37,740 --> 00:57:39,642
You're not going home, dumbass.

1601
00:57:39,675 --> 00:57:42,011
- I'm so tired.
- No.

1602
00:57:42,444 --> 00:57:44,346
Everyone is just so

1603
00:57:44,346 --> 00:57:46,081
adamant of wanting to show their best,

1604
00:57:46,081 --> 00:57:48,117
and sometimes when you don't achieve that,

1605
00:57:48,117 --> 00:57:48,717
you just—

1606
00:57:48,717 --> 00:57:51,687
it's cultural also to be so hard on ourselves.

1607
00:57:51,787 --> 00:57:53,322
You're so talented.

1608
00:57:53,322 --> 00:57:53,889
Yeah.

1609
00:57:53,889 --> 00:57:55,057
I know you cannot see it right now

1610
00:57:55,057 --> 00:57:56,158
just because you feel so weak

1611
00:57:56,158 --> 00:57:57,626
and you feel so tired,

1612
00:57:57,693 --> 00:57:58,827
but you're the same person

1613
00:57:58,827 --> 00:58:00,529
that walked in, girl.

1614
00:58:00,596 --> 00:58:02,097
You're the same person.

1615
00:58:02,097 --> 00:58:03,666
Nothing has changed.

1616
00:58:03,666 --> 00:58:05,834
Girl, we're all tired.

1617
00:58:05,868 --> 00:58:06,969
Pick it up,

1618
00:58:06,969 --> 00:58:08,571
stand up, and fight.

1619
00:58:08,604 --> 00:58:11,774
Because, girl, you're Khianna, right?

1620
00:58:11,774 --> 00:58:13,609
Comparing me and Khianna,

1621
00:58:13,642 --> 00:58:15,811
she's very amazing to me.

1622
00:58:16,045 --> 00:58:19,048
At my age, at 35,

1623
00:58:19,081 --> 00:58:20,516
you guys taught me how—

1624
00:58:20,749 --> 00:58:22,785
how to do your drag, your art.

1625
00:58:24,153 --> 00:58:24,853
Oh, my God.

1626
00:58:29,892 --> 00:58:30,826
Come on.

1627
00:58:31,260 --> 00:58:33,228
Do you know how many Asian girls right now

1628
00:58:33,228 --> 00:58:35,064
want to be here and you're here

1629
00:58:35,130 --> 00:58:36,365
and you want to give up?

1630
00:58:36,699 --> 00:58:38,100
Yeah, give her a second.

1631
00:58:38,100 --> 00:58:40,169
She just needs to be by herself for a second.

1632
00:58:42,571 --> 00:58:44,473
I just really want to go home.

1633
00:58:45,107 --> 00:58:48,310
I really think I had an anxiety attack.

1634
00:58:48,310 --> 00:58:50,913
I was having a hard time breathing.

1635
00:58:50,946 --> 00:58:53,849
I just feel like I was in a ride of emotions.

1636
00:58:54,483 --> 00:58:56,418
After I just walked out,

1637
00:58:56,418 --> 00:58:57,653
I just realized, like,

1638
00:58:57,686 --> 00:58:59,855
what the fuck am I doing?

1639
00:59:00,055 --> 00:59:01,590
To be honest, I don't—

1640
00:59:02,057 --> 00:59:03,759
I didn't really see any fire

1641
00:59:03,792 --> 00:59:06,195
in both of your cases.

1642
00:59:06,195 --> 00:59:07,229
Is it just me?

1643
00:59:10,065 --> 00:59:11,367
Girls, there's so many people

1644
00:59:11,367 --> 00:59:12,534
who would have fought for your spot

1645
00:59:12,568 --> 00:59:14,003
to be here.

1646
00:59:14,336 --> 00:59:14,737
Know what I mean?

1647
00:59:14,737 --> 00:59:17,006
Like all the other sisters that just left.

1648
00:59:17,239 --> 00:59:18,941
What's happening?

1649
00:59:19,108 --> 00:59:21,043
You've done so much to be here.

1650
00:59:21,110 --> 00:59:22,745
You've worked so hard to be here.

1651
00:59:22,745 --> 00:59:23,979
You've been at tops and the bottoms,

1652
00:59:23,979 --> 00:59:26,215
and now you're just sitting here like idle.

1653
00:59:26,248 --> 00:59:28,350
I find it in a way disrespectful

1654
00:59:28,384 --> 00:59:29,918
that you will take a spot

1655
00:59:29,918 --> 00:59:30,819
and the space

1656
00:59:30,819 --> 00:59:32,388
if you're not going to fight for it.

1657
00:59:33,188 --> 00:59:35,257
I want to stay

1658
00:59:35,758 --> 00:59:37,292
because I haven't seen

1659
00:59:37,326 --> 00:59:39,695
or found myself yet.

1660
00:59:39,962 --> 00:59:42,097
And I want to be the best version

1661
00:59:42,164 --> 00:59:44,099
that you will ever defeat.

1662
00:59:44,333 --> 00:59:45,934
I have to show the people

1663
00:59:45,934 --> 00:59:48,771
who love me, see me fight.

1664
00:59:48,804 --> 00:59:51,006
I will try to fight for me a little bit.

1665
00:59:52,174 --> 00:59:53,909
I want to stay as well

1666
00:59:53,909 --> 00:59:55,678
because I just feel like

1667
00:59:56,912 --> 00:59:58,414
the Phusri,

1668
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:00,082
the Siam Phusri,

1669
01:00:00,349 --> 01:00:02,584
just came out,

1670
01:00:03,485 --> 01:00:05,521
just enjoyed the stay,

1671
01:00:05,821 --> 01:00:08,157
just enjoyed the moment of the song.

1672
01:00:08,924 --> 01:00:09,992
I'm safe,

1673
01:00:10,292 --> 01:00:11,560
I'm safe,

1674
01:00:11,560 --> 01:00:12,461
- and you,
- Shh! Shh!

1675
01:00:12,461 --> 01:00:13,662
Shh.

1676
01:00:13,662 --> 01:00:14,830
- please love me.
- Shh.

1677
01:00:14,830 --> 01:00:16,765
Stop chanting.

1678
01:00:19,702 --> 01:00:21,537
It's not hard for me to choose.

1679
01:00:21,537 --> 01:00:24,406
I was really affected by

1680
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:26,942
what she did earlier.

1681
01:00:26,942 --> 01:00:28,877
And now she will get affected by me.

1682
01:00:28,877 --> 01:00:30,245
So, stop chanting.

1683
01:00:30,245 --> 01:00:30,846
Kidding!

1684
01:00:34,450 --> 01:00:35,884
The lipstick that I will choose

1685
01:00:35,884 --> 01:00:37,086
is someone that

1686
01:00:37,086 --> 01:00:39,054
I really love and appreciate

1687
01:00:39,088 --> 01:00:40,856
for what she does.

1688
01:00:40,889 --> 01:00:43,025
Although in this competition,

1689
01:00:43,025 --> 01:00:44,626
she's been struggling.

1690
01:00:44,660 --> 01:00:45,661
So I think

1691
01:00:45,661 --> 01:00:48,063
this is her time to go now.

1692
01:00:49,031 --> 01:00:50,833
It's my first time

1693
01:00:50,833 --> 01:00:52,501
to get to choose a lipstick.

1694
01:00:52,701 --> 01:00:53,736
Not gonna lie,

1695
01:00:53,736 --> 01:00:54,837
this is kind of fun.

1696
01:00:54,837 --> 01:00:56,038
I get to be like

1697
01:00:56,271 --> 01:00:57,773
dramatic and pick a lipstick.

1698
01:00:57,806 --> 01:00:58,774
But seriously,

1699
01:00:58,807 --> 01:01:00,609
somebody's got to go.

1700
01:01:00,609 --> 01:01:01,877
And it's you, baby.

1701
01:01:07,116 --> 01:01:09,284
Alyssa, the game is simple.

1702
01:01:09,284 --> 01:01:10,853
All you need to do is guess the word

1703
01:01:10,853 --> 01:01:12,521
written on your forehead

1704
01:01:12,554 --> 01:01:13,956
by asking us a question

1705
01:01:13,989 --> 01:01:15,624
and we can only answer yes

1706
01:01:15,624 --> 01:01:16,325
or no.
Got it?

1707
01:01:17,025 --> 01:01:17,693
Got it.

1708
01:01:17,693 --> 01:01:18,994
I'll start.

1709
01:01:19,728 --> 01:01:20,896
Is this a person?

1710
01:01:20,929 --> 01:01:21,897
Correct!

1711
01:01:22,765 --> 01:01:23,899
That's amazing!

1712
01:01:23,899 --> 01:01:25,033
That's fast, Katkat.

1713
01:01:25,267 --> 01:01:26,201
Alyssa, your turn.

1714
01:01:26,201 --> 01:01:27,202
Is this a person?

1715
01:01:27,202 --> 01:01:28,170
No.

1716
01:01:28,170 --> 01:01:29,571
Is this a food?

1717
01:01:29,605 --> 01:01:30,806
No.

1718
01:01:30,939 --> 01:01:32,274
What about an animal?

1719
01:01:32,508 --> 01:01:33,509
Yes!

1720
01:01:33,509 --> 01:01:34,143
Is it a-

1721
01:01:34,143 --> 01:01:35,844
animal, animal, animal, okay.

1722
01:01:36,011 --> 01:01:37,246
Is it a beast?!

1723
01:01:37,346 --> 01:01:38,947
- Yes!
- Correct!

1724
01:01:39,281 --> 01:01:40,315
I won!

1725
01:01:40,349 --> 01:01:42,251
- Oh, my God!
- Condragulations!

1726
01:01:43,285 --> 01:01:44,486
Fun's over.

1727
01:01:44,620 --> 01:01:47,456
Bring back my political butterflies.

1728
01:01:50,425 --> 01:01:52,961
Welcome back, ladies.

1729
01:01:52,995 --> 01:01:56,899
Three top Slaysians stand before me.

1730
01:01:57,065 --> 01:01:58,400
Prior to tonight,

1731
01:01:58,467 --> 01:02:01,436
you were asked to prepare a lip sync performance of

1732
01:02:01,503 --> 01:02:02,738
“Out of My Head”

1733
01:02:02,771 --> 01:02:05,774
by the Nation's Girl Group, BINI.

1734
01:02:06,241 --> 01:02:09,378
Ladies, this is your chance to impress me

1735
01:02:09,411 --> 01:02:12,815
and earn the power to give one of the Bottom queens

1736
01:02:12,881 --> 01:02:14,716
the karate chop.

1737
01:02:16,185 --> 01:02:18,320
The time has come,

1738
01:02:19,721 --> 01:02:22,090
for you to Lip Sync

1739
01:02:22,257 --> 01:02:25,561
for your Legacy!

1740
01:02:26,762 --> 01:02:28,163
Yuhua and Brigiding,

1741
01:02:28,197 --> 01:02:29,832
I will prove to you that

1742
01:02:29,832 --> 01:02:32,267
the National Mouth of the Philippines is right here.

1743
01:02:32,367 --> 01:02:33,368
Good luck Queens,

1744
01:02:33,368 --> 01:02:35,904
and don't fuck it up.

1745
01:02:35,904 --> 01:02:37,806
I've worked hard for this challenge,

1746
01:02:37,806 --> 01:02:41,076
so I think this lip sync win will be mine.

1747
01:02:41,243 --> 01:02:42,811
Viñas and Brigiding,

1748
01:02:42,811 --> 01:02:45,013
I know y'all are fierce-ass lip syncers,

1749
01:02:45,013 --> 01:02:45,948
but baby,

1750
01:02:45,948 --> 01:02:47,482
I'm going to bring you my version

1751
01:02:47,516 --> 01:02:48,817
of performing.

1752
01:02:49,651 --> 01:02:51,119
Get it, girls!

1753
01:02:51,787 --> 01:02:52,654
Let's go

1754
01:02:52,855 --> 01:02:56,024
Stepped out of a movie scene

1755
01:02:56,592 --> 01:02:59,628
Feels like you are my wildest dream

1756
01:03:00,095 --> 01:03:03,131
I'll be the queen and you'll be the knight

1757
01:03:03,398 --> 01:03:06,835
But don't you think, I won't speak my mind

1758
01:03:07,736 --> 01:03:10,539
Coming out of a fantasy

1759
01:03:11,406 --> 01:03:14,643
Make believe in our greatest schemes

1760
01:03:14,877 --> 01:03:17,880
I'll cast a spell and you'll do the crime

1761
01:03:18,113 --> 01:03:21,583
A match more perfect than fate designed

1762
01:03:22,417 --> 01:03:25,888
Tick tock, the clock is talking

1763
01:03:26,188 --> 01:03:29,925
Don't think too much (Don't think too much)

1764
01:03:29,958 --> 01:03:33,128
It's just a simple question

1765
01:03:33,128 --> 01:03:36,865
To fall, to fall (Hey) to fall in love

1766
01:03:37,065 --> 01:03:43,939
I want out of my, I want out of my head

1767
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:50,712
Can't seem to find, can't seem to find the path ahead

1768
01:03:50,846 --> 01:03:54,116
You makin' me blind and keepin' me up at night

1769
01:03:54,149 --> 01:03:55,951
Don't know which way to go

1770
01:03:55,984 --> 01:03:58,287
My heart's lost all control

1771
01:03:59,454 --> 01:04:05,394
I want out of my, I want out of my head

1772
01:04:05,460 --> 01:04:06,361
(Out of my head)

1773
01:04:06,361 --> 01:04:08,130
Come on, come on, hey, don't walk away

1774
01:04:08,130 --> 01:04:10,165
Sometimes what's scary is worth all the pain

1775
01:04:10,165 --> 01:04:11,934
Pressure from stone build it like diamonds

1776
01:04:11,934 --> 01:04:14,002
I'll be the queen of all our islands (Yeah)

1777
01:04:14,002 --> 01:04:15,837
Be real, be true, be calm

1778
01:04:15,837 --> 01:04:17,439
Babe love can do no wrong

1779
01:04:17,439 --> 01:04:19,207
Don't overthink, don't stand on the edge

1780
01:04:19,274 --> 01:04:20,909
Life is much sweeter when you're off the ledge (Oh)

1781
01:04:20,909 --> 01:04:22,945
Wanna take time, wanna figure things out

1782
01:04:22,978 --> 01:04:25,080
Treat me like the one, show me all good crowds

1783
01:04:25,080 --> 01:04:26,448
Need a rose or a story to tell

1784
01:04:26,648 --> 01:04:28,483
Might be known as the candy that fell

1785
01:04:28,483 --> 01:04:30,485
My mind, my heart, ain't trusted

1786
01:04:30,485 --> 01:04:32,254
Been at war since you just walked in

1787
01:04:32,254 --> 01:04:33,956
'Scuse me for bein' straightforward

1788
01:04:33,956 --> 01:04:36,291
You make me wanna lose then start all over

1789
01:04:36,291 --> 01:04:39,594
Tick tock, the clock is talking

1790
01:04:40,028 --> 01:04:43,765
Don't think too much (Don't think too much)

1791
01:04:43,765 --> 01:04:46,969
It's just a simple question

1792
01:04:47,002 --> 01:04:50,706
To fall, to fall (Hey) to fall in love

1793
01:04:50,706 --> 01:04:58,280
I want out of my, I want out of my head

1794
01:04:58,313 --> 01:05:05,420
Can't seem to find, can't seem to find the path ahead

1795
01:05:05,687 --> 01:05:12,995
I want out of my, I want out of my head

1796
01:05:13,228 --> 01:05:19,434
Can't seem to find, can't seem to find the path ahead

1797
01:05:19,434 --> 01:05:22,738
You makin' me blind and keepin' me up at night

1798
01:05:22,738 --> 01:05:24,573
Don't know which way to go

1799
01:05:24,606 --> 01:05:26,675
My heart's lost all control

1800
01:05:28,076 --> 01:05:34,349
I want out of my, I want out of my head

1801
01:05:34,349 --> 01:05:35,617
(Out of my head)

1802
01:05:35,617 --> 01:05:37,452
Yes!

1803
01:05:38,353 --> 01:05:40,689
Alright girls!

1804
01:05:42,591 --> 01:05:43,892
Ladies,

1805
01:05:43,959 --> 01:05:46,428
I have made my decision.

1806
01:05:49,331 --> 01:05:51,366
Yuhua.

1807
01:05:52,768 --> 01:05:53,969
Condragulations!

1808
01:05:53,969 --> 01:05:54,403
Oh, my God!

1809
01:05:54,403 --> 01:05:56,905
- You're a winner, baby!
- Thank you! Thank you!

1810
01:05:56,938 --> 01:06:00,042
You've won a cash tip of 80,000 pesos!

1811
01:06:00,042 --> 01:06:01,910
I beat these two Pinay queens

1812
01:06:01,910 --> 01:06:02,844
and this is...

1813
01:06:02,878 --> 01:06:04,446
Oh, my God!

1814
01:06:04,446 --> 01:06:05,147
Thank you.

1815
01:06:05,147 --> 01:06:06,982
- You will also receive a RuBadge!
- Oh, my God!

1816
01:06:06,982 --> 01:06:08,950
Give her a RuBadge!

1817
01:06:08,984 --> 01:06:11,620
Yay!

1818
01:06:11,620 --> 01:06:14,322
Yuhua wear it with Slaysian pride!

1819
01:06:14,322 --> 01:06:15,057
I will.

1820
01:06:15,123 --> 01:06:17,692
Yuhua is something else, right?

1821
01:06:17,692 --> 01:06:19,961
I didn't expect that from her.

1822
01:06:20,328 --> 01:06:22,798
Viñas DeLuxe, Brigiding,

1823
01:06:23,031 --> 01:06:25,667
you are safe to slay another day.

1824
01:06:25,801 --> 01:06:27,069
Please join the other girls.

1825
01:06:27,069 --> 01:06:28,203
You were also great.

1826
01:06:28,203 --> 01:06:29,938
Thank you!

1827
01:06:29,938 --> 01:06:32,674
- Thank you, Queens.
- Thank you!

1828
01:06:34,810 --> 01:06:37,446
Now, will the Bottom 2 queens

1829
01:06:37,446 --> 01:06:40,148
please step forward.

1830
01:06:50,492 --> 01:06:52,027
Yuhua.

1831
01:06:52,294 --> 01:06:55,630
With great power from our Slaysian ancestors,

1832
01:06:55,697 --> 01:06:58,266
comes great responsibility.

1833
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:00,969
Which queen have you chosen

1834
01:07:01,036 --> 01:07:03,171
to get the karate chop?

1835
01:07:03,238 --> 01:07:05,640
The queen that I have chosen,

1836
01:07:06,174 --> 01:07:08,176
she is super talented.

1837
01:07:09,611 --> 01:07:12,280
But based on the pleading of the cases,

1838
01:07:12,714 --> 01:07:14,416
I'm sorry to say

1839
01:07:14,850 --> 01:07:16,218
that I'll be sending home...

1840
01:07:19,087 --> 01:07:20,322
Siam.

1841
01:07:23,425 --> 01:07:25,460
As it is written,

1842
01:07:25,494 --> 01:07:27,195
so it shall be done.

1843
01:07:28,130 --> 01:07:29,898
Siam Phusri.

1844
01:07:29,965 --> 01:07:32,834
Our glamorous Thai temptress.

1845
01:07:33,068 --> 01:07:35,237
You will always be a Slaysian sensation.

1846
01:07:35,270 --> 01:07:36,371
Now,

1847
01:07:36,404 --> 01:07:38,006
sashay away.

1848
01:07:38,039 --> 01:07:39,841
I still want to

1849
01:07:40,142 --> 01:07:41,877
thank you, all of you.

1850
01:07:41,910 --> 01:07:42,677
I learned a lot.
I learned a few things

1851
01:07:43,578 --> 01:07:45,447
and I enjoyed everything.

1852
01:07:45,514 --> 01:07:47,282
Just enjoy life.

1853
01:07:47,616 --> 01:07:49,351
Take a breath in,

1854
01:07:49,417 --> 01:07:50,619
and breathe out.

1855
01:07:50,652 --> 01:07:53,555
And Phusri on tonight.

1856
01:07:53,588 --> 01:07:56,458
Yes, queen!

1857
01:07:58,226 --> 01:07:59,327
My new song,

1858
01:07:59,327 --> 01:08:00,762
Phusri On

1859
01:08:00,795 --> 01:08:02,430
Tonight.

1860
01:08:08,170 --> 01:08:10,906
I'm so honored to be working with

1861
01:08:10,939 --> 01:08:12,107
beautiful,

1862
01:08:12,140 --> 01:08:14,176
very talented queens,

1863
01:08:14,209 --> 01:08:16,478
Asian queens, who make me feel so proud

1864
01:08:16,478 --> 01:08:17,712
to be Asian.

1865
01:08:17,779 --> 01:08:20,182
I hope I can see you guys

1866
01:08:20,182 --> 01:08:22,017
and everyone around the world.

1867
01:08:22,384 --> 01:08:27,489
Let me, Siam Phusri, in your area.

1868
01:08:27,756 --> 01:08:31,927
I see you in...

1869
01:08:31,927 --> 01:08:34,296
the...

1870
01:08:34,529 --> 01:08:38,567
sky!

1871
01:08:40,969 --> 01:08:43,004
Condragulations, Queens.

1872
01:08:43,071 --> 01:08:45,173
You have made all your mothers proud!

1873
01:08:45,173 --> 01:08:47,008
Your mothers are all queens!

1874
01:08:47,042 --> 01:08:49,611
Your mother is a queen too!

1875
01:08:50,412 --> 01:08:52,380
And remember, always be true to yourself

1876
01:08:52,380 --> 01:08:54,082
in your thoughts, in your words,

1877
01:08:54,115 --> 01:08:55,050
and in all that you do.

1878
01:08:55,050 --> 01:08:58,853
All hearts, always, and in all ways.

1879
01:08:58,853 --> 01:09:00,622
Can I get an eme up in here?

1880
01:09:00,622 --> 01:09:02,991
Eme!

1881
01:09:03,024 --> 01:09:06,361
And, oh, wait a minute, just a second,

1882
01:09:06,561 --> 01:09:08,797
I have one more thing to say.

1883
01:09:08,830 --> 01:09:10,131
Oh, my gosh!

1884
01:09:10,131 --> 01:09:11,566
I'm so scared!

1885
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:13,168
Starting next week,

1886
01:09:13,268 --> 01:09:18,273
Slaysian Royale rules are lifted, officially!

1887
01:09:18,573 --> 01:09:20,308
Wait, what?

1888
01:09:20,909 --> 01:09:24,246
Yes, you heard that right, but...

1889
01:09:24,246 --> 01:09:27,082
Are you ready to lip sync the house down?

1890
01:09:27,115 --> 01:09:27,515
Yes!

1891
01:09:27,515 --> 01:09:29,851
Well, Queens, you better be because next week,

1892
01:09:29,851 --> 01:09:34,356
you will all go head-to-head in an all-out drag war.

1893
01:09:34,389 --> 01:09:37,592
Get ready for battle because it is time for

1894
01:09:37,626 --> 01:09:41,796
the Lip Sync LaLaPaRuza Slaysian Smackdown!

1895
01:09:42,530 --> 01:09:44,866
We're doing the LaLaPaRuza and it's about time.

1896
01:09:44,899 --> 01:09:48,203
Everyone here are performers and I want to see what's our styles.

1897
01:09:48,303 --> 01:09:51,006
Oh, my God, like I don't do any props.

1898
01:09:51,039 --> 01:09:54,142
So, I'm so scared and nervous for this.

1899
01:09:57,912 --> 01:09:59,047
Now let the music play.

1900
01:09:59,080 --> 01:10:00,749
Party, party!

1901
01:10:13,828 --> 01:10:16,531
Next, on Drag Race Philippines: Slaysian Royale.

1902
01:10:18,633 --> 01:10:22,437
Welcome to Drag Race Philippines: Slaysian Royale's first-ever

1903
01:10:22,470 --> 01:10:26,374
Lip Sync LaLaParuza Slaysian Smackdown!

1904
01:10:26,908 --> 01:10:28,543
This is exactly why I came

1905
01:10:28,543 --> 01:10:30,312
- to the Philippines was to see

1906
01:10:30,312 --> 01:10:31,212
some good drag.
Mama Pao, I want to be honest.

1907
01:10:31,680 --> 01:10:32,547
Mama Pao, I want to be honest.

1908
01:10:32,547 --> 01:10:33,882
I’m very disappointed.

1909
01:10:33,982 --> 01:10:36,518
I’m like “what the fuck is going on?”

1910
01:10:36,718 --> 01:10:38,286
I just wanted to say I'm sorry

1911
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:39,120
because...
I gave up.

1912
01:10:39,754 --> 01:10:40,588
But this time,

1913
01:10:40,588 --> 01:10:41,756
I’m sorry again because

1914
01:10:41,756 --> 01:10:43,458
I'm sending y’all guys home.
