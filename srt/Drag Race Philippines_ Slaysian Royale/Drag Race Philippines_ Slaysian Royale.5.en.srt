1
00:00:01,044 --> 00:00:03,880
Previously on Drag Race Philippines: Slaysian Royale.

2
00:00:04,347 --> 00:00:05,048
Oh, my God!

3
00:00:05,048 --> 00:00:07,016
Get ready to be crazy!

4
00:00:07,016 --> 00:00:08,584
Because tomorrow, you'll be starring

5
00:00:08,584 --> 00:00:11,320
in a Rusical production entitled,

6
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:13,956
Crazy Bitch Slaysians.

7
00:00:13,956 --> 00:00:17,794
No no no no no!!!

8
00:00:17,927 --> 00:00:19,362
Kitty Space.

9
00:00:19,362 --> 00:00:21,564
I think there was a problem with your lip sync.

10
00:00:21,731 --> 00:00:23,132
And for me, you were not sharp.

11
00:00:23,299 --> 00:00:23,833
Bernie.

12
00:00:23,833 --> 00:00:25,034
Your character

13
00:00:25,034 --> 00:00:26,369
for me, fell flat.

14
00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:27,036
Brigiding.

15
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:29,972
You are such a great drag artist.

16
00:00:30,139 --> 00:00:31,507
This is your moment!

17
00:00:31,741 --> 00:00:33,609
Arizona Brandy.

18
00:00:33,609 --> 00:00:34,277
It was...

19
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:36,779
near perfection when it came to your performance.

20
00:00:36,779 --> 00:00:37,613
Brigiding.

21
00:00:37,613 --> 00:00:38,748
Arizona Brandy.

22
00:00:38,781 --> 00:00:40,116
Condragratulations,

23
00:00:40,116 --> 00:00:42,385
you are the Top 2 Slaysians

24
00:00:42,385 --> 00:00:43,352
of the week.

25
00:00:43,586 --> 00:00:44,454
That means,

26
00:00:44,454 --> 00:00:45,054
Bernie,

27
00:00:45,054 --> 00:00:46,456
and Kitty Space,

28
00:00:46,456 --> 00:00:49,292
You are the Bottom 2 queens of the week.

29
00:00:49,392 --> 00:00:50,793
Arizona Brandy,

30
00:00:50,793 --> 00:00:53,196
you are a winner, baby.

31
00:00:53,196 --> 00:00:55,898
Which queen have you chosen to give

32
00:00:55,898 --> 00:00:57,033
the karate chop?

33
00:00:57,033 --> 00:00:58,634
So I choose...

34
00:00:58,634 --> 00:01:00,336
Kitty Space.

35
00:01:00,336 --> 00:01:01,571
Kitty Space,

36
00:01:01,571 --> 00:01:02,338
au revoir.

37
00:01:02,338 --> 00:01:03,639
And sashay away.

38
00:01:09,312 --> 00:01:11,781
Congrats.

39
00:01:12,748 --> 00:01:14,317
And we're back.

40
00:01:15,551 --> 00:01:18,721
Another international queen, gone.

41
00:01:18,821 --> 00:01:25,461
(French)

42
00:01:25,495 --> 00:01:26,429
What?

43
00:01:26,462 --> 00:01:29,232
Reading Kitty's lipstick message...

44
00:01:29,232 --> 00:01:30,433
I had a

45
00:01:30,466 --> 00:01:31,200
headache.

46
00:01:32,368 --> 00:01:33,503
- What did she say?
- In French?

47
00:01:33,503 --> 00:01:35,805
I'll continue to ruin you and your dreams.

48
00:01:35,805 --> 00:01:37,773
- Slay, accla.
- Really?

49
00:01:37,974 --> 00:01:38,774
No.

50
00:01:38,808 --> 00:01:41,377
She said continue to believe in your dreams.

51
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:43,880
Slay, accla.

52
00:01:44,147 --> 00:01:45,815
- I love you, Kitty.
- We love you, Kitty.

53
00:01:45,948 --> 00:01:47,650
To be performing against Arizona,

54
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:48,718
was a little nerve-wracking because

55
00:01:48,718 --> 00:01:51,053
we know Arizona is the queen of reveals.

56
00:01:51,053 --> 00:01:52,655
I didn't see what she did,

57
00:01:52,655 --> 00:01:54,891
but I know the judges were gagging.

58
00:01:54,891 --> 00:01:56,859
I think it's a testimony that

59
00:01:56,859 --> 00:01:58,494
some people may have

60
00:01:58,494 --> 00:01:59,562
had mistakes.

61
00:01:59,762 --> 00:02:02,198
If you give them the chance, they may

62
00:02:02,198 --> 00:02:03,699
rise from the top.

63
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,034
To the top.

64
00:02:05,067 --> 00:02:05,868
To the—sorry,

65
00:02:05,868 --> 00:02:06,702
to the top.

66
00:02:08,304 --> 00:02:08,871
I’m mad.

67
00:02:08,871 --> 00:02:10,239
And I'm sad at the same time.

68
00:02:10,473 --> 00:02:12,375
Because I know deep down,

69
00:02:12,375 --> 00:02:13,409
they're gonna pick

70
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:15,478
my best friends to go home.

71
00:02:15,711 --> 00:02:17,313
The lipstick that I chose

72
00:02:17,313 --> 00:02:19,549
is someone that I am

73
00:02:19,549 --> 00:02:21,050
very, very close with.

74
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:22,451
I chose...

75
00:02:22,451 --> 00:02:23,920
Kitty as well.

76
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,454
It is what it is.

77
00:02:25,755 --> 00:02:27,924
So, I hope Bernie doesn't waste

78
00:02:27,924 --> 00:02:30,826
the chance that we gave her.

79
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,062
Thank you for this second chance.

80
00:02:33,329 --> 00:02:34,096
But this time,

81
00:02:34,096 --> 00:02:35,598
this is the first and the last time

82
00:02:35,598 --> 00:02:37,200
that I will be in the bottom.

83
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,301
Are you sure?

84
00:02:38,301 --> 00:02:38,834
Yes.

85
00:02:38,834 --> 00:02:40,536
This is the first and last.

86
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:42,872
I hope she does really well this time

87
00:02:42,872 --> 00:02:45,208
because if she's gonna be in the bottom,

88
00:02:45,474 --> 00:02:45,942
again.

89
00:02:45,942 --> 00:02:46,576
Girl.

90
00:02:46,576 --> 00:02:48,477
I will not save you, girl.

91
00:02:48,611 --> 00:02:49,712
Yeah, because next time

92
00:02:49,712 --> 00:02:51,747
it's gonna be all international again, huh?

93
00:02:51,781 --> 00:02:53,082
If international queens

94
00:02:53,115 --> 00:02:54,483
are in the bottom again, you're gonna pick

95
00:02:54,483 --> 00:02:55,418
to send an international queen home.

96
00:02:55,418 --> 00:02:58,221
No, no! It's not that we're picking international queens, like,

97
00:02:58,621 --> 00:03:00,590
For me, my reason was,

98
00:03:00,623 --> 00:03:02,458
she tried to pick my lipstick.

99
00:03:02,725 --> 00:03:03,226
And,

100
00:03:03,526 --> 00:03:05,294
it kind of evens out the game

101
00:03:05,294 --> 00:03:06,429
because all the time

102
00:03:06,429 --> 00:03:07,663
Bernie was safe and

103
00:03:07,697 --> 00:03:08,598
then the bottom and

104
00:03:08,598 --> 00:03:10,166
then Kitty has one low.

105
00:03:10,299 --> 00:03:11,667
And so that's how I saw

106
00:03:11,667 --> 00:03:12,935
the track record thing.

107
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:15,938
I feel like they're lying.

108
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:18,374
Kitty Space was more fashionable.

109
00:03:18,641 --> 00:03:19,809
Because she's from Paris.

110
00:03:19,809 --> 00:03:21,277
She served everything that

111
00:03:21,277 --> 00:03:22,578
we've never seen in the show.

112
00:03:22,712 --> 00:03:23,946
But, I understand.

113
00:03:25,081 --> 00:03:26,849
I don't think that the other queens,

114
00:03:26,849 --> 00:03:29,318
Siam, are seeing the fact that Kitty Space,

115
00:03:29,318 --> 00:03:31,587
Ivory, Sum Ting, as well as Madame Yoko

116
00:03:31,587 --> 00:03:33,422
aren't doing as well as the other queens.

117
00:03:33,589 --> 00:03:35,791
I don't think that the Pinay queens are ganging up on us.

118
00:03:36,025 --> 00:03:37,560
I just think it's based on performance.

119
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,662
I realize that

120
00:03:40,796 --> 00:03:43,132
most of the international queens aren't ready.

121
00:03:46,202 --> 00:03:47,703
But personally,

122
00:03:48,271 --> 00:03:49,639
I thought...

123
00:03:51,173 --> 00:03:52,708
Kitty should be safe.

124
00:03:53,943 --> 00:03:55,578
And who should leave?

125
00:03:55,678 --> 00:03:56,812
I'm sorry, Sister,

126
00:03:56,812 --> 00:03:58,414
but it's just a personal

127
00:03:58,414 --> 00:03:59,181
thing for me because

128
00:03:59,215 --> 00:04:00,683
I know you personally.

129
00:04:00,983 --> 00:04:01,917
You're very good.

130
00:04:01,917 --> 00:04:03,152
You're very that bitch.

131
00:04:03,152 --> 00:04:05,154
And as of this season,

132
00:04:05,187 --> 00:04:06,856
I am not

133
00:04:06,856 --> 00:04:07,723
looking at

134
00:04:07,723 --> 00:04:09,959
the same Bernie I was inspired by with.

135
00:04:11,127 --> 00:04:12,495
Babe, it's done.

136
00:04:12,495 --> 00:04:14,263
The lipstick on the mirror has been erased.

137
00:04:14,263 --> 00:04:15,564
I was about to go home...

138
00:04:15,564 --> 00:04:16,999
So, just give me a break.

139
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:18,768
Let's de-drag!

140
00:04:18,768 --> 00:04:20,236
De-drag time!

141
00:04:20,236 --> 00:04:21,404
Bye, girls!

142
00:04:22,338 --> 00:04:23,739
You're so aggressive today, Sis!

143
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,375
She's bringing the drama, Mama.

144
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:29,712
Are y’all guys watching right now?

145
00:04:29,712 --> 00:04:31,447
Everybody needs to step their pussy up.

146
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:33,516
You did so well.

147
00:04:33,516 --> 00:04:35,751
Everybody needs to step their pussy up, so let's go.

148
00:04:43,626 --> 00:04:46,195
The winner of Drag Race Philippines: Slaysian Royale

149
00:04:46,195 --> 00:04:47,697
will receive a one-year supply of

150
00:04:47,697 --> 00:04:49,465
Anastasia Beverly Hills Cosmetics.

151
00:04:49,465 --> 00:04:50,700
A coveted spot

152
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:53,002
on the Drag Race Slaysian Hall of Fame.

153
00:04:53,002 --> 00:04:54,370
And a cash prize of...

154
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:55,871
2 Million Pesos!

155
00:04:55,871 --> 00:04:57,373
Powered by Bingo Plus.

156
00:04:57,373 --> 00:04:59,775
Tonight, with our extra special guest judges,

157
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:01,110
Captivating Katkat,

158
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:02,745
and Alyssa Edwards!

159
00:05:17,259 --> 00:05:19,195
It's a brand new week!

160
00:05:19,228 --> 00:05:21,564
And because it's a brand new week, there's...

161
00:05:21,697 --> 00:05:22,565
Brandy.

162
00:05:22,565 --> 00:05:23,432
Brandy Arizona.

163
00:05:23,432 --> 00:05:24,900
There's Arizona Brandy.

164
00:05:25,167 --> 00:05:29,138
- Congratulations, Ari!
- Congratulations!

165
00:05:29,372 --> 00:05:31,974
Oh, my God. I manifested it.

166
00:05:33,976 --> 00:05:35,344
I’ll take that. I’ll take—

167
00:05:35,811 --> 00:05:37,680
I'll take that bootleg badge, girl.

168
00:05:38,781 --> 00:05:40,649
I don't have the RoBadge anymore.

169
00:05:40,649 --> 00:05:42,485
I have the RuBadge.

170
00:05:42,485 --> 00:05:43,853
But how did we feel about

171
00:05:43,886 --> 00:05:45,454
last elimination?

172
00:05:45,488 --> 00:05:45,988
For me...

173
00:05:46,822 --> 00:05:49,492
Yeah, If somebody doesn't want me here,

174
00:05:49,492 --> 00:05:50,760
they better leave first.

175
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,962
Because if I'm going to be there again,

176
00:05:52,962 --> 00:05:54,563
they might vote for me again.

177
00:05:54,597 --> 00:05:56,432
- She's in survival mode, y’all.
- Right.

178
00:05:56,432 --> 00:05:57,967
Yeah, but I think it's right also

179
00:05:57,967 --> 00:06:00,069
we talked about the track record and being fair.

180
00:06:00,069 --> 00:06:01,871
But obviously we come back and then we see

181
00:06:01,871 --> 00:06:03,305
how the person actually plays.

182
00:06:03,305 --> 00:06:05,241
And also like if the person wants to be there.

183
00:06:05,274 --> 00:06:06,842
There's like isolated cases,

184
00:06:06,842 --> 00:06:07,710
and we need to see if

185
00:06:07,743 --> 00:06:09,111
the person actually wants to fight.

186
00:06:09,145 --> 00:06:09,812
Same, I agree.

187
00:06:09,845 --> 00:06:10,646
Some of them I felt like,

188
00:06:10,679 --> 00:06:12,047
they were just here for the ride.

189
00:06:12,081 --> 00:06:13,315
Because I've heard some of them said,

190
00:06:13,315 --> 00:06:15,084
“Well, I just wanna make it past through Episode 2"

191
00:06:15,084 --> 00:06:16,952
I'm like, girl, don't you want to be in the finale?

192
00:06:16,952 --> 00:06:17,453
Yeah.

193
00:06:17,453 --> 00:06:19,288
I'm one of three

194
00:06:19,321 --> 00:06:20,923
international queens left.

195
00:06:20,956 --> 00:06:23,325
Yuhua, Suki, Siam,

196
00:06:23,325 --> 00:06:26,362
please win the next thing.

197
00:06:26,395 --> 00:06:27,096
Please.

198
00:06:27,163 --> 00:06:27,930
What are we gonna do?

199
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:29,965
Is it gonna be track record, or like,

200
00:06:29,965 --> 00:06:32,134
- a personal connection to somebody?
- Well, I think,

201
00:06:32,168 --> 00:06:33,436
that I'm the type of Asian that

202
00:06:33,436 --> 00:06:34,570
loves to do Excels.

203
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:35,938
Given that, I do...

204
00:06:35,938 --> 00:06:37,039
So what's coming on?

205
00:06:37,072 --> 00:06:39,141
I think it's good to have a scoring system.

206
00:06:39,241 --> 00:06:39,809
Oh.

207
00:06:39,809 --> 00:06:41,310
And to know, like, where we place.

208
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:42,378
I just want to comment on

209
00:06:42,378 --> 00:06:43,679
what you said last time,

210
00:06:43,679 --> 00:06:45,881
that Kitty should have been the one to stay.

211
00:06:45,915 --> 00:06:47,416
Yeah, Kitty was on Top once.

212
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:50,119
But if you look at the track record, we're the same.

213
00:06:50,152 --> 00:06:51,687
No, they're not the same because

214
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,022
Kitty has been in the top.

215
00:06:53,088 --> 00:06:53,689
Yeah.

216
00:06:53,722 --> 00:06:55,591
- And Bernie hasn't been.
- Oh.

217
00:06:55,591 --> 00:06:57,827
- It's very similar.
- It's similar.

218
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:58,661
- Yeah, it's similar.
- That it

219
00:06:58,694 --> 00:07:00,329
boils down to what you want to do with it.

220
00:07:00,329 --> 00:07:01,096
- Yes.
- Right.

221
00:07:01,096 --> 00:07:02,531
I also think it comes down to

222
00:07:02,531 --> 00:07:03,866
if they want to be here or not.

223
00:07:03,866 --> 00:07:04,633
And I feel like

224
00:07:04,633 --> 00:07:07,336
- you wanted to be here... more.
- Yes, I told that...

225
00:07:07,336 --> 00:07:08,404
Before, like—

226
00:07:08,437 --> 00:07:10,439
But why did you say that Bernie should

227
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:11,106
be the one leaving,

228
00:07:11,106 --> 00:07:12,575
if that's what you said?

229
00:07:12,608 --> 00:07:13,776
- Because, just because—
- Ooh, messy.

230
00:07:13,776 --> 00:07:15,644
No, no, I'm just clarifying.

231
00:07:15,678 --> 00:07:16,879
- Because that's what you said.
- It's because of the track record

232
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:18,848
because everyone's telling everyone that

233
00:07:18,848 --> 00:07:20,115
it has to be based on the track record,

234
00:07:20,115 --> 00:07:20,783
it has to be this,

235
00:07:20,783 --> 00:07:21,450
it has to be that.

236
00:07:21,484 --> 00:07:22,551
And you also said my name

237
00:07:22,551 --> 00:07:23,519
that I wasn't deserving

238
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:24,820
to be on Top 4, so...

239
00:07:25,588 --> 00:07:27,456
Who do you see in the Top 4?

240
00:07:27,456 --> 00:07:29,358
Viñas, you,

241
00:07:29,358 --> 00:07:30,392
me,

242
00:07:31,527 --> 00:07:32,094
and Ari.

243
00:07:32,695 --> 00:07:34,763
So that's why you said that about me.

244
00:07:34,763 --> 00:07:35,764
- At the end of the day,
- That's not it.

245
00:07:35,798 --> 00:07:37,733
there aren't any judges here, right?

246
00:07:37,733 --> 00:07:39,335
- Yeah, exactly, you're not
- I was just saying—

247
00:07:39,368 --> 00:07:40,703
I'm judging you.

248
00:07:40,703 --> 00:07:41,737
But thank you.

249
00:07:41,737 --> 00:07:42,872
You gave me a wake-up call.

250
00:07:44,907 --> 00:07:46,141
Oh, my God!

251
00:07:46,275 --> 00:07:47,910
Ooh, girl.

252
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:51,046
She done already done had herses.

253
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,115
My hardworking queens.

254
00:07:54,016 --> 00:07:56,552
Get ready for a box that rocks.

255
00:07:56,819 --> 00:07:58,254
Please handle with care.

256
00:07:58,254 --> 00:08:00,189
Because what's inside

257
00:08:00,189 --> 00:08:02,191
has flown around the world

258
00:08:02,191 --> 00:08:04,026
and back just for you.

259
00:08:05,828 --> 00:08:06,862
Transformation?!

260
00:08:06,862 --> 00:08:09,031
Transformation!

261
00:08:09,031 --> 00:08:11,600
Haller! Haller! Haller!

262
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,502
- Hello, hello, Queens.
- Mama Pao!

263
00:08:13,502 --> 00:08:14,937
Mama Pao!

264
00:08:15,204 --> 00:08:18,674
Mama Pao! Mama Pao!

265
00:08:18,674 --> 00:08:20,175
Mama Pao!

266
00:08:20,175 --> 00:08:21,644
Queens, the competition has been

267
00:08:21,644 --> 00:08:23,445
tightening like a tangled web.

268
00:08:23,479 --> 00:08:25,080
But only the fiercest

269
00:08:25,114 --> 00:08:26,582
will scuttle their way

270
00:08:26,615 --> 00:08:27,683
to victory.

271
00:08:27,683 --> 00:08:29,685
Well, luckily for our Mini Challenge,

272
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:31,220
we will do just that.

273
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,555
Oh, my God.

274
00:08:32,588 --> 00:08:34,657
We are bringing you a battle of balance and strategy

275
00:08:34,657 --> 00:08:35,824
In a game we call,

276
00:08:36,158 --> 00:08:37,226
“Spidergay!”

277
00:08:38,827 --> 00:08:39,929
Spidergay!

278
00:08:40,062 --> 00:08:41,697
Oh, it means gay spiders.

279
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:42,898
Perfect.

280
00:08:42,932 --> 00:08:44,233
Queens, you have 15 minutes

281
00:08:44,233 --> 00:08:45,601
to get into your fiercest

282
00:08:45,601 --> 00:08:47,503
Spidergay quick drag looks.

283
00:08:47,503 --> 00:08:48,637
So, spin it

284
00:08:48,671 --> 00:08:50,039
and win it!

285
00:08:50,072 --> 00:08:51,206
Come on, Queens!

286
00:08:51,206 --> 00:08:53,108
15 minutes!

287
00:08:54,076 --> 00:08:54,710
Okay, Queens.

288
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:55,945
In the Philippines we usually

289
00:08:55,945 --> 00:08:57,012
do this on a stick.

290
00:08:57,046 --> 00:08:58,614
But this is Drag Race, baby.

291
00:08:58,614 --> 00:09:00,249
So, it's a STICK!

292
00:09:01,817 --> 00:09:02,751
It's actually very exciting.

293
00:09:02,785 --> 00:09:04,553
It’s like I’m a child again.

294
00:09:04,553 --> 00:09:05,387
When I was in elementary,

295
00:09:05,387 --> 00:09:07,823
they would sell spiders in front of our schools.

296
00:09:07,856 --> 00:09:09,925
Here's the deal. Each queen will choose

297
00:09:09,925 --> 00:09:11,994
her opponent for a one-on-one duel.

298
00:09:12,027 --> 00:09:14,430
Whatever web of drama you've been holding on to.

299
00:09:14,496 --> 00:09:15,664
It's time to release your

300
00:09:15,698 --> 00:09:16,832
inner arachnid

301
00:09:16,832 --> 00:09:19,668
and knock your rival off that platform.

302
00:09:19,702 --> 00:09:20,469
Are you ready?

303
00:09:20,502 --> 00:09:21,904
YES!

304
00:09:21,904 --> 00:09:24,106
You can now choose your opponent. Grab a queen!

305
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,509
- Don't kill them yet.
- I didn’t get to do anything!

306
00:09:28,444 --> 00:09:29,578
After seven rounds,

307
00:09:29,578 --> 00:09:32,014
Queens, the last queen standing, wins.

308
00:09:32,014 --> 00:09:33,515
Are you ready to fight for your spot?

309
00:09:33,649 --> 00:09:35,184
- Yes!
- Yes!

310
00:09:35,184 --> 00:09:36,318
It’s giving...

311
00:09:36,418 --> 00:09:38,454
a face-off, literally, because some of them...

312
00:09:39,555 --> 00:09:40,856
Some of them are scared because

313
00:09:40,856 --> 00:09:41,991
they've had their noses done.

314
00:09:41,991 --> 00:09:44,093
So I feel like this is going to be easy.

315
00:09:46,061 --> 00:09:48,697
All right, we have our first pair of Spidergays.

316
00:09:48,697 --> 00:09:49,965
Bernie and Viñas.

317
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:53,235
- Spidergays, go!
- Do it!

318
00:09:57,106 --> 00:09:59,008
I feel like she lost on purpose.

319
00:09:59,008 --> 00:10:00,509
So she comes off more feminine.

320
00:10:00,509 --> 00:10:01,610
I'm kidding!

321
00:10:01,644 --> 00:10:02,244
Out!

322
00:10:02,277 --> 00:10:02,878
Bernie.

323
00:10:02,911 --> 00:10:04,580
Oh, Bernie.

324
00:10:04,613 --> 00:10:07,483
Next Spidergays. Arizona and Khianna.

325
00:10:07,516 --> 00:10:09,785
Aim for the foreign body, okay?

326
00:10:09,785 --> 00:10:10,986
Yes!

327
00:10:12,187 --> 00:10:15,391
We gave a show, of course, as first runner-ups.

328
00:10:15,391 --> 00:10:16,792
The ones who lost, you know? Kidding!

329
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:20,462
- Go sisters!
- The rivalry of the franchise.

330
00:10:37,413 --> 00:10:39,648
Fuck you, bitch!

331
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:43,085
Of course, she's gonna win.

332
00:10:43,085 --> 00:10:44,653
Because you know, she's...

333
00:10:44,653 --> 00:10:45,954
very desperate!

334
00:10:45,988 --> 00:10:47,356
Desperate to beat me.

335
00:10:47,356 --> 00:10:50,259
- Next Spidergays. We have Suki and Siam.
- Hi, Siam.

336
00:10:50,259 --> 00:10:54,029
Go, Siam, and Suki.

337
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:55,464
My strategy is to

338
00:10:55,464 --> 00:10:56,465
push her

339
00:10:56,498 --> 00:10:58,400
at her weakest moment.

340
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:04,873
Here we go!

341
00:11:08,911 --> 00:11:09,945
You're so strong!

342
00:11:09,945 --> 00:11:11,613
It's just a game!

343
00:11:12,214 --> 00:11:13,082
Well,

344
00:11:13,115 --> 00:11:14,750
you balance better than me...

345
00:11:14,817 --> 00:11:15,584
That's it.

346
00:11:16,185 --> 00:11:17,853
Brigiding and Yuhua.

347
00:11:17,853 --> 00:11:19,788
Come on, Spidergays, go!

348
00:11:21,757 --> 00:11:25,461
Yuhua, the leech!

349
00:11:25,461 --> 00:11:26,428
Leech?

350
00:11:29,198 --> 00:11:32,000
That's not fair! I've never played this before!

351
00:11:32,534 --> 00:11:34,570
Oh, my God, you strong ass bitch.

352
00:11:35,471 --> 00:11:36,972
For the semifinals,

353
00:11:37,005 --> 00:11:38,373
Viñas and Khianna.

354
00:11:39,675 --> 00:11:43,078
- Viñas, the leech!
- Bring it on, bitches!

355
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:44,813
Khianna, dumbass!

356
00:11:48,417 --> 00:11:49,351
Dumbass!

357
00:11:49,351 --> 00:11:50,953
I was gagging!

358
00:11:50,953 --> 00:11:53,956
Khianna was so strong.

359
00:11:53,989 --> 00:11:56,024
Brigding and Suki, semifinals, go!

360
00:11:56,458 --> 00:11:58,026
Suki has balls!

361
00:11:58,193 --> 00:11:59,762
Suki has balls!

362
00:12:00,362 --> 00:12:01,797
Brigiding, dumbass!

363
00:12:06,435 --> 00:12:08,537
Oh, my God, you're so strong!

364
00:12:08,537 --> 00:12:09,738
You're so strong.

365
00:12:09,772 --> 00:12:11,774
I just won against Brigiding.

366
00:12:11,807 --> 00:12:13,575
Obviously, she's so tiny,

367
00:12:13,575 --> 00:12:14,910
one push is all it took.

368
00:12:15,644 --> 00:12:17,379
And for the final round we have,

369
00:12:17,379 --> 00:12:18,847
Spidergay Suki, and

370
00:12:18,847 --> 00:12:21,383
Spidergay Khianna.

371
00:12:23,352 --> 00:12:25,754
It's always that ending.

372
00:12:26,021 --> 00:12:27,322
International Queen

373
00:12:27,823 --> 00:12:29,158
versus a Filipina Queen.

374
00:12:31,193 --> 00:12:34,363
- Dumb and big balls!
- Go, queens!

375
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:39,401
Go for it!

376
00:12:39,401 --> 00:12:40,736
- Do it!
- Hit her face!

377
00:12:41,103 --> 00:12:42,905
The face! Hit the face!

378
00:12:43,105 --> 00:12:44,706
- Hit the face!
- Hit the balls!

379
00:12:44,706 --> 00:12:45,374
My gosh!

380
00:12:54,082 --> 00:12:54,850
Queens.

381
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:57,186
There's a true Spidergay amongst us.

382
00:12:57,186 --> 00:12:59,154
The winner of today's Mini Challenge is...

383
00:12:59,154 --> 00:13:00,622
Khianna!

384
00:13:03,559 --> 00:13:06,061
Dumbass! Dumbass! Dumbass!

385
00:13:06,061 --> 00:13:06,995
What do you want?

386
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:07,963
KBBQ?

387
00:13:08,497 --> 00:13:09,364
Burger?

388
00:13:09,364 --> 00:13:10,299
Pizza?

389
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:11,633
Khianna's got you.

390
00:13:13,202 --> 00:13:16,271
You have won a cash tip of 20,000 pesos.

391
00:13:16,271 --> 00:13:17,439
Yay!

392
00:13:17,506 --> 00:13:19,708
If there's something Khianna's good at

393
00:13:19,741 --> 00:13:21,743
it's winning the Mini Challenges.

394
00:13:23,312 --> 00:13:24,980
Well, playing childhood games like that

395
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,782
really brings the most of us home.

396
00:13:26,815 --> 00:13:29,084
That sense of familiarity and

397
00:13:29,117 --> 00:13:30,152
comfort.

398
00:13:30,185 --> 00:13:32,821
And that's exactly what many Filipinos abroad

399
00:13:32,855 --> 00:13:36,191
feel as they work tirelessly in unfamiliar lands.

400
00:13:36,191 --> 00:13:37,726
Wait.

401
00:13:37,926 --> 00:13:38,694
Can you hear that?

402
00:13:38,694 --> 00:13:40,128
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

403
00:13:40,429 --> 00:13:41,263
What is that?

404
00:13:41,263 --> 00:13:42,664
They just arrived!

405
00:13:43,131 --> 00:13:45,334
So for this week's Maxi Challenge,

406
00:13:45,367 --> 00:13:46,969
we're bringing them home.

407
00:13:46,969 --> 00:13:48,403
The Philippines biggest export

408
00:13:48,403 --> 00:13:49,404
and the backbone of

409
00:13:49,438 --> 00:13:51,506
the global workforce,

410
00:13:51,506 --> 00:13:52,875
some of them are here today.

411
00:13:52,908 --> 00:13:55,277
Let's welcome our balikbayans!
(Overseas Filipino Workers coming home)

412
00:13:57,145 --> 00:13:57,913
First up,

413
00:13:57,913 --> 00:14:00,315
a resilient mom with a heart of gold.

414
00:14:00,315 --> 00:14:02,484
Miss Ermie Caoile!

415
00:14:05,053 --> 00:14:05,654
Next.

416
00:14:05,687 --> 00:14:06,822
Single mom and vlogger,

417
00:14:06,855 --> 00:14:07,556
let's all welcome

418
00:14:07,589 --> 00:14:09,625
Miss Christine Salta!

419
00:14:11,827 --> 00:14:12,427
Hi!

420
00:14:12,427 --> 00:14:14,529
Yes, girl!

421
00:14:14,696 --> 00:14:15,898
Digital marketer,

422
00:14:15,898 --> 00:14:17,933
Miss Angelique Parungao!

423
00:14:18,867 --> 00:14:19,735
Hey!

424
00:14:19,735 --> 00:14:21,536
Hi!

425
00:14:21,536 --> 00:14:23,438
And lastly, we have a teacher

426
00:14:23,472 --> 00:14:26,141
who has a training center for OFWs.

427
00:14:26,141 --> 00:14:26,942
Let's all welcome,

428
00:14:26,942 --> 00:14:28,677
Miss Bevily Devis!

429
00:14:28,677 --> 00:14:30,946
- Hey!
- Hi!

430
00:14:31,179 --> 00:14:31,980
Queens,

431
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:33,515
say hello to our

432
00:14:33,515 --> 00:14:35,784
Overseas Filipino Workers.

433
00:14:35,817 --> 00:14:38,353
- Our OFWs.
- Hello, everyone.

434
00:14:38,387 --> 00:14:40,255
OFWs are really

435
00:14:40,255 --> 00:14:41,556
important because

436
00:14:41,556 --> 00:14:43,325
they are heroes to us.

437
00:14:43,358 --> 00:14:45,327
They leave their families here,

438
00:14:45,327 --> 00:14:47,329
to take care of other families

439
00:14:47,329 --> 00:14:49,264
in other countries.

440
00:14:49,298 --> 00:14:50,866
Just so they could provide for their families.

441
00:14:50,899 --> 00:14:52,034
So your job Queens is to

442
00:14:52,034 --> 00:14:53,769
make their homecoming night

443
00:14:53,802 --> 00:14:55,537
a night they will never forget.

444
00:14:55,704 --> 00:14:56,738
And the theme is

445
00:14:56,772 --> 00:14:58,607
Homecoming Gala Night.

446
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:01,810
Transforming them as part of your drag family.

447
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:02,678
Makeover!

448
00:15:02,678 --> 00:15:04,112
I am pretty good at, you know,

449
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:05,747
doing aesthetics and styling people,

450
00:15:05,747 --> 00:15:07,549
so I want to see what I can pull off.

451
00:15:07,616 --> 00:15:08,483
But there's a twist.

452
00:15:08,517 --> 00:15:09,985
You'll have to do it in pairs.

453
00:15:10,152 --> 00:15:10,819
Queens.

454
00:15:10,919 --> 00:15:12,087
Go ahead, and

455
00:15:12,087 --> 00:15:12,921
pair up.

456
00:15:13,255 --> 00:15:13,922
Pair up!

457
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:15,390
Oh.

458
00:15:16,425 --> 00:15:17,793
We said we’re gonna be together.

459
00:15:17,793 --> 00:15:18,193
Oh, okay.

460
00:15:18,193 --> 00:15:19,594
So obviously, I do have a little

461
00:15:19,594 --> 00:15:20,963
crush on Brigiding.

462
00:15:20,963 --> 00:15:22,030
And she's really cute.

463
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:22,965
She's very talented

464
00:15:22,965 --> 00:15:24,900
and she's good at what she does, so...

465
00:15:24,967 --> 00:15:26,034
She's—yes.

466
00:15:26,068 --> 00:15:28,337
Bitch, I thought we were best friends now.

467
00:15:28,737 --> 00:15:30,672
I'm really confused about who I should pick.

468
00:15:30,672 --> 00:15:32,007
The one I love, or the one who loves me,

469
00:15:32,007 --> 00:15:33,041
you know what I mean?

470
00:15:33,075 --> 00:15:34,676
We have Bernie, Arizona.

471
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:36,244
Khianna and Siam.

472
00:15:36,445 --> 00:15:38,046
Brigiding and Suki.

473
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:39,581
And Viñas and Yuhua.

474
00:15:39,614 --> 00:15:40,382
Oh, okay.

475
00:15:40,382 --> 00:15:41,283
Khianna,

476
00:15:41,283 --> 00:15:43,018
maybe it's time for me

477
00:15:43,051 --> 00:15:44,686
to get to know you more, okay.

478
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,954
Excited to work with you.

479
00:15:45,954 --> 00:15:47,656
Because you won the Mini Challenge,

480
00:15:47,656 --> 00:15:49,791
Khianna, you have the power

481
00:15:49,825 --> 00:15:52,260
to assign our balikbayans to

482
00:15:52,294 --> 00:15:53,528
their drag families.

483
00:15:53,562 --> 00:15:57,432
So my pick for Bernie and Arizona is...

484
00:15:57,466 --> 00:15:58,934
- Hello, Ma'am Ermie.
- Hi, hello.

485
00:15:59,668 --> 00:16:01,803
- Nice meeting you.
- Hello, Ma'am.

486
00:16:02,304 --> 00:16:04,239
I'm gonna choose,

487
00:16:04,239 --> 00:16:05,507
Teacher, and give her to

488
00:16:05,674 --> 00:16:08,176
Brigiding and Suki.

489
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:09,811
- Hello, Ma'am.
- Hi!

490
00:16:09,811 --> 00:16:11,980
Viñas and Yuhua,

491
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:13,415
to...

492
00:16:13,415 --> 00:16:16,218
- Omg, hello, twin.
- Welcome!

493
00:16:16,551 --> 00:16:19,454
And oh, my gosh, hello, nice to meet you.

494
00:16:19,588 --> 00:16:20,589
So she'll be in our team.

495
00:16:21,823 --> 00:16:24,393
When I first saw Mother Christine, I just

496
00:16:24,393 --> 00:16:25,594
felt like we were connected.

497
00:16:25,594 --> 00:16:27,429
I didn't really strategize that much

498
00:16:27,429 --> 00:16:29,431
because I know that these girls

499
00:16:29,431 --> 00:16:31,700
are going to do their best.

500
00:16:31,733 --> 00:16:32,801
Oh, one more thing.

501
00:16:32,834 --> 00:16:33,535
Khianna.

502
00:16:33,568 --> 00:16:35,570
In addition to your winning advantage,

503
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:37,072
you have the power to switch

504
00:16:37,072 --> 00:16:38,473
things up, literally.

505
00:16:39,474 --> 00:16:41,143
You have to choose a queen

506
00:16:41,176 --> 00:16:42,310
from a different pair

507
00:16:42,344 --> 00:16:44,179
to switch with another group.

508
00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:46,481
You know, for more drama.

509
00:16:46,681 --> 00:16:48,617
Drama?!

510
00:16:49,384 --> 00:16:50,052
Hmmm.

511
00:16:53,588 --> 00:16:55,624
So I have the power to choose.

512
00:16:56,258 --> 00:16:57,125
Hmmm.

513
00:16:58,460 --> 00:16:59,027
Oh, my God.

514
00:16:59,027 --> 00:17:00,228
I was staring at Khianna

515
00:17:00,228 --> 00:17:01,730
and speaking through my eyes, I told her,

516
00:17:01,997 --> 00:17:03,265
"Pick me."

517
00:17:04,866 --> 00:17:07,536
I wanna take sister V,

518
00:17:07,602 --> 00:17:08,637
as my partner

519
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:11,640
and Siam to go to Yuhua.

520
00:17:12,107 --> 00:17:13,975
Aww, nice to meet you.

521
00:17:14,009 --> 00:17:16,778
Khianna, you shady ass bitch.

522
00:17:16,845 --> 00:17:17,913
So to recap,

523
00:17:17,946 --> 00:17:19,347
Khianna and Viñas,

524
00:17:19,381 --> 00:17:20,382
is the new group.

525
00:17:20,449 --> 00:17:23,118
I think that Viñas also had a connection with her,

526
00:17:23,351 --> 00:17:24,886
so I chose Viñas.

527
00:17:24,886 --> 00:17:25,620
That's just about it.

528
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:27,589
The RuBadge group,

529
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:28,590
- right?
- Oh.

530
00:17:28,757 --> 00:17:30,492
With Mommy Christine.

531
00:17:30,525 --> 00:17:32,327
And Siam and Yuhua,

532
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,029
with Angelique.

533
00:17:34,029 --> 00:17:37,499
Sis, Khianna, it seems you want to pick a fight outside.

534
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,335
Siam, how do you feel?

535
00:17:40,335 --> 00:17:41,136
I feel awesome.

536
00:17:41,136 --> 00:17:42,370
To be passed around?

537
00:17:42,404 --> 00:17:43,271
I'm all good.

538
00:17:43,472 --> 00:17:44,673
That means she's popular.

539
00:17:44,673 --> 00:17:45,474
Yes.

540
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:47,409
So you don't want to be friends with me?

541
00:17:48,143 --> 00:17:49,044
So sad.

542
00:17:49,077 --> 00:17:50,812
But me and Yuhua,

543
00:17:50,812 --> 00:17:54,216
will make everything work, girl.

544
00:17:54,649 --> 00:17:57,185
Now that you all have your OFW partners,

545
00:17:57,219 --> 00:17:58,253
feel free to use the makeup

546
00:17:58,253 --> 00:18:00,722
provided by Anastasia Beverly Hills Cosmetics

547
00:18:01,056 --> 00:18:03,191
Brought us by none other than,

548
00:18:03,191 --> 00:18:04,659
the president herself,

549
00:18:04,693 --> 00:18:06,361
Norvina.

550
00:18:06,361 --> 00:18:07,562
Oh, my God!

551
00:18:07,562 --> 00:18:08,296
Mabuhay, Queens!

552
00:18:08,296 --> 00:18:09,231
Norvina here,

553
00:18:09,231 --> 00:18:10,632
and I'm absolutely thrilled to have

554
00:18:10,632 --> 00:18:11,800
Anastasia Beverly Hills

555
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,969
return to the Drag Race Philippines stage

556
00:18:14,002 --> 00:18:16,238
for the Homecoming Queens Makeover Challenge.

557
00:18:16,571 --> 00:18:18,373
I'm excited to see the cast this season.

558
00:18:18,673 --> 00:18:20,242
Our makeup and beauty products are here

559
00:18:20,242 --> 00:18:22,310
to empower you and your hardworking

560
00:18:22,344 --> 00:18:24,379
Overseas Filipino Worker partners

561
00:18:24,412 --> 00:18:25,347
to fully embrace your

562
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:27,349
inner Slaysian Royale personas.

563
00:18:27,449 --> 00:18:28,683
Let's make your mothers proud,

564
00:18:28,717 --> 00:18:29,985
and spread the love.

565
00:18:30,018 --> 00:18:32,320
Sending you all virtual hugs and kisses.

566
00:18:32,387 --> 00:18:33,388
Thank you!

567
00:18:33,722 --> 00:18:34,422
Bye!

568
00:18:34,923 --> 00:18:37,792
Thank you!

569
00:18:37,792 --> 00:18:39,361
Thank you, Norvina

570
00:18:39,361 --> 00:18:41,630
and Anastasia Beverly Hills Cosmetics!

571
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:42,697
And to our balikbayans,

572
00:18:42,697 --> 00:18:44,032
Enjoy your day off today!

573
00:18:44,032 --> 00:18:45,467
- Yes!
- With these Queens.

574
00:18:45,734 --> 00:18:47,402
Enjoy!

575
00:18:47,435 --> 00:18:49,204
Alright, see you later. Bye!

576
00:18:51,206 --> 00:18:54,209
Mama Pao! Mama Pao!

577
00:18:54,209 --> 00:18:55,477
Bye!

578
00:18:55,744 --> 00:18:57,078
- Let's go, Mother.
- So, what's next?

579
00:18:57,312 --> 00:18:58,780
I'm super excited for the makeover.

580
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,483
Because it's one of the challenges I won

581
00:19:01,516 --> 00:19:02,984
during my season.

582
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,254
I am very, very excited.

583
00:19:06,288 --> 00:19:07,556
This is the episode where

584
00:19:07,556 --> 00:19:09,824
I left, in Season 1.

585
00:19:09,858 --> 00:19:10,892
I'm so excited

586
00:19:10,892 --> 00:19:11,893
- for this one.
- Yeah, are you excited?

587
00:19:11,893 --> 00:19:12,527
How, how—

588
00:19:12,561 --> 00:19:14,262
- How excited am I?
- Yeah, how excited are you?

589
00:19:14,262 --> 00:19:15,864
- Are you excited?
- How are you feeling right now?

590
00:19:16,298 --> 00:19:17,599
Ecstatic.

591
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:20,302
- Wow, ecstatic?!
- Ecstatic?!

592
00:19:21,236 --> 00:19:23,004
So, we got Mommy Bevily

593
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:24,105
who seems to be,

594
00:19:24,105 --> 00:19:25,640
out of all four,

595
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,709
the most energetic.

596
00:19:27,709 --> 00:19:28,777
How long have you been

597
00:19:28,777 --> 00:19:30,111
an OFW?

598
00:19:30,512 --> 00:19:31,813
I was in Dubai

599
00:19:31,813 --> 00:19:33,615
for, like, eight years.

600
00:19:33,615 --> 00:19:34,683
But before I went there,

601
00:19:34,683 --> 00:19:36,351
I was a college professor.

602
00:19:36,351 --> 00:19:37,586
I want to ask, Mother,

603
00:19:37,619 --> 00:19:38,987
why did you go to Dubai?

604
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:40,322
I'm a single mom.

605
00:19:40,422 --> 00:19:41,790
And I also have my

606
00:19:41,823 --> 00:19:42,824
extended family.

607
00:19:42,857 --> 00:19:44,593
So, my brothers, my sisters...

608
00:19:45,193 --> 00:19:46,728
I wasn't really like—

609
00:19:46,728 --> 00:19:48,363
I don't really provide everything.

610
00:19:48,396 --> 00:19:49,965
- but of course...
- You support them, too.

611
00:19:49,965 --> 00:19:51,733
- That's part of the Filipino values.
- I know.

612
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,968
I relate so much to it

613
00:19:52,968 --> 00:19:53,969
because my own mother

614
00:19:53,969 --> 00:19:55,170
had to leave the country.

615
00:19:55,203 --> 00:19:56,071
We were displaced

616
00:19:56,071 --> 00:19:57,005
because of the war, and

617
00:19:57,005 --> 00:19:58,306
she had to start over.

618
00:19:58,306 --> 00:19:59,174
So when she's talking,

619
00:19:59,174 --> 00:20:01,243
I can only imagine my mother talking to me.

620
00:20:01,276 --> 00:20:03,111
You remind me of my mother just because she

621
00:20:03,144 --> 00:20:04,946
was also a single mother.

622
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,181
And she had to raise all of us,

623
00:20:06,214 --> 00:20:06,915
we were six kids.

624
00:20:06,948 --> 00:20:08,416
She was working three jobs,

625
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:09,718
she was working sometimes four jobs,

626
00:20:09,718 --> 00:20:11,353
and every time she'd come home, she's so tired.

627
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:12,821
And I don't get to see her.

628
00:20:13,054 --> 00:20:14,189
So, yeah.

629
00:20:14,756 --> 00:20:16,324
Thank you for taking care of your sons.

630
00:20:17,892 --> 00:20:19,594
I'm happy to get to know Suki

631
00:20:19,594 --> 00:20:20,829
on a deeper level

632
00:20:20,829 --> 00:20:21,963
through this challenge.

633
00:20:21,997 --> 00:20:22,797
Suki is one of the most

634
00:20:22,831 --> 00:20:25,033
beautiful drag queens I've seen so far.

635
00:20:25,166 --> 00:20:26,635
You need a tissue?

636
00:20:26,868 --> 00:20:28,637
So how do we win this?

637
00:20:28,637 --> 00:20:30,071
- What's the plan?
- So here it is.

638
00:20:30,071 --> 00:20:32,274
- Here's the plan...
- We need to win.

639
00:20:32,307 --> 00:20:33,808
My mom was an OFW

640
00:20:33,808 --> 00:20:35,410
for like 15 years.

641
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:36,978
I relate to the stories of

642
00:20:37,012 --> 00:20:39,047
all the OFWs because

643
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,750
most of them have to leave their families.

644
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,551
Life always knocks us down.

645
00:20:44,152 --> 00:20:44,919
But this time,

646
00:20:44,919 --> 00:20:47,622
- you have the power.
- Yeah.

647
00:20:47,656 --> 00:20:50,492
We want to make her experience, even just for a day,

648
00:20:50,492 --> 00:20:52,193
to be high and mighty.

649
00:20:52,294 --> 00:20:54,763
Kinda like a sweet revenge on life.

650
00:20:54,763 --> 00:20:56,064
It suits you really well, Mother.

651
00:20:56,431 --> 00:20:58,300
- I got you.
- This is exciting.

652
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,702
- Hi, Mommy.
- Hello.

653
00:21:00,735 --> 00:21:02,003
When she was in Japan,

654
00:21:02,037 --> 00:21:03,705
she said that she was alone,

655
00:21:03,738 --> 00:21:06,241
and she had all the money, but,

656
00:21:06,274 --> 00:21:08,310
money really can't buy happiness.

657
00:21:08,443 --> 00:21:11,046
Of course, you're happy because you're earning

658
00:21:11,046 --> 00:21:13,081
and money is good, right?

659
00:21:13,081 --> 00:21:13,882
But,

660
00:21:13,882 --> 00:21:15,884
the truth is, happiness,

661
00:21:15,884 --> 00:21:17,585
is here, in the Philippines.

662
00:21:17,585 --> 00:21:19,387
Even though you have lots of money,

663
00:21:19,387 --> 00:21:20,288
but

664
00:21:20,288 --> 00:21:22,924
it's different being with your family.

665
00:21:22,924 --> 00:21:24,426
My aunt,

666
00:21:24,459 --> 00:21:25,760
who worked

667
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,028
hard for us,

668
00:21:27,028 --> 00:21:29,197
- also worked in Japan.
- She was the one helping you?

669
00:21:29,197 --> 00:21:30,532
My father also worked in Japan, that's why

670
00:21:30,532 --> 00:21:32,434
I chose you immediately.

671
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,369
- Because I felt so connected to you.
- You remember them.

672
00:21:34,369 --> 00:21:36,237
My mother's also an OFW.

673
00:21:36,237 --> 00:21:38,173
My two sisters, as well.

674
00:21:38,173 --> 00:21:40,008
And I feel really sad,

675
00:21:40,241 --> 00:21:42,610
that I grew up to be an adult,

676
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:45,213
without Mama around, most of the time.

677
00:21:45,213 --> 00:21:48,850
I cried because I guess I missed my Mama.

678
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:50,985
I know she works hard for

679
00:21:50,985 --> 00:21:52,153
us, so,

680
00:21:52,153 --> 00:21:53,321
I'm so happy for that.

681
00:21:53,321 --> 00:21:55,357
And we were able to build a house,

682
00:21:55,357 --> 00:21:56,424
because of her.

683
00:21:56,958 --> 00:21:58,460
We're grateful, of course, but the work—

684
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,495
- Did you rebel?
- No, Ma'am.

685
00:22:00,495 --> 00:22:02,364
My child did.

686
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:03,598
So her child,

687
00:22:03,598 --> 00:22:05,400
grew up with an aunt.

688
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,668
It's basically me.

689
00:22:06,668 --> 00:22:08,403
I'd often get left with my aunt.

690
00:22:08,737 --> 00:22:10,739
I was one of the children

691
00:22:10,905 --> 00:22:12,240
who rebelled.

692
00:22:13,241 --> 00:22:14,242
It was really hard for me.

693
00:22:14,242 --> 00:22:15,143
It's hard, I know.

694
00:22:15,143 --> 00:22:16,277
You know what used to happen?

695
00:22:16,277 --> 00:22:17,078
When I'd come home,

696
00:22:17,078 --> 00:22:18,947
my child would ignore me.

697
00:22:18,947 --> 00:22:20,849
And when I'd have to leave,

698
00:22:20,849 --> 00:22:21,683
I'd ask for a kiss,

699
00:22:22,517 --> 00:22:23,952
but he'd just lay down and ignore me.

700
00:22:23,952 --> 00:22:25,887
It was so painful.

701
00:22:25,887 --> 00:22:28,123
It was heartbreaking, I'm telling you.

702
00:22:28,356 --> 00:22:31,159
For a mother, it's devastating, but,

703
00:22:31,659 --> 00:22:33,461
I had to do it.

704
00:22:33,461 --> 00:22:36,231
I had to endure

705
00:22:36,231 --> 00:22:38,032
so I could give them everything.

706
00:22:38,032 --> 00:22:39,467
I want her to experience

707
00:22:39,467 --> 00:22:40,702
the best experience

708
00:22:40,702 --> 00:22:41,970
that she never had.

709
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:43,772
- So, how do you feel?
- Hi.

710
00:22:43,772 --> 00:22:44,806
Hi, good.

711
00:22:44,806 --> 00:22:46,975
- Yeah?
- I’m so happy to be here.

712
00:22:46,975 --> 00:22:49,577
- Okay, welcome!
- Because I'm a fan of RuPaul's Drag Race.

713
00:22:50,512 --> 00:22:52,914
She's from the US season.

714
00:22:52,947 --> 00:22:54,582
I love Makeover Challenges

715
00:22:54,582 --> 00:22:56,518
because it shows your artistry

716
00:22:56,551 --> 00:22:58,453
on how you deal with different faces,

717
00:22:58,453 --> 00:22:59,154
wig,

718
00:22:59,187 --> 00:23:00,255
and, also, guiding them

719
00:23:00,288 --> 00:23:02,123
how to find their drag character.

720
00:23:02,157 --> 00:23:03,825
When did you go overseas?

721
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:05,126
2013.

722
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,628
First in Malaysia,

723
00:23:06,661 --> 00:23:07,796
and then Thailand.

724
00:23:08,129 --> 00:23:10,632
Thailand? Hello!

725
00:23:10,765 --> 00:23:13,001
Remind me, what did you do overseas, again?

726
00:23:13,334 --> 00:23:14,335
I do marketing.

727
00:23:14,369 --> 00:23:15,603
- Marketing, okay.
- Oh, marketing.

728
00:23:15,637 --> 00:23:16,604
OFW

729
00:23:16,638 --> 00:23:18,506
is completely new to me.

730
00:23:18,506 --> 00:23:19,774
I've never heard of it.

731
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:21,509
I've learned something new here,

732
00:23:21,509 --> 00:23:22,811
but a lot of the stories that

733
00:23:22,844 --> 00:23:24,112
everybody shared

734
00:23:24,412 --> 00:23:25,547
was very similar.

735
00:23:25,947 --> 00:23:27,048
That it was hard.

736
00:23:27,048 --> 00:23:28,550
Well, because my dad is like,

737
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:29,551
ninety something.

738
00:23:29,551 --> 00:23:30,718
So when he gets sick,

739
00:23:30,718 --> 00:23:32,220
or he goes to the hospital,

740
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:33,254
it's like, it's so difficult

741
00:23:33,254 --> 00:23:34,756
not to worry and stuff.

742
00:23:34,756 --> 00:23:36,424
So I think it's more of, like,

743
00:23:36,491 --> 00:23:37,826
the guilt of being away

744
00:23:37,826 --> 00:23:39,160
and not being there,

745
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,663
it's like, oh, my God...

746
00:23:41,696 --> 00:23:43,898
You know, it gets difficult because

747
00:23:43,898 --> 00:23:45,600
I don't wanna ask from them

748
00:23:45,633 --> 00:23:46,935
because they're too far.

749
00:23:46,935 --> 00:23:48,036
Oh, my God.

750
00:23:48,403 --> 00:23:50,071
I know, you want to be like,

751
00:23:50,071 --> 00:23:51,739
make everyone happy and

752
00:23:51,773 --> 00:23:52,807
you don't want anyone to

753
00:23:52,807 --> 00:23:54,008
feel serious and sad about you,

754
00:23:54,008 --> 00:23:57,212
- you don't want to show you're emotional.
- Yes. I don't want them to worry.

755
00:23:57,245 --> 00:23:58,746
It's happened to me also, like,

756
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:00,682
- when Mom would say something,
- Sorry.

757
00:24:00,715 --> 00:24:03,251
- That's okay. We'll have some tissue for you.
- we always say we're fine.

758
00:24:03,751 --> 00:24:05,153
We always say we're okay,

759
00:24:05,186 --> 00:24:07,655
but deep down, we still worry as well.

760
00:24:07,689 --> 00:24:08,656
It's like me.

761
00:24:08,656 --> 00:24:11,326
Sometimes, I try to be too strong.

762
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:12,460
I try to be like,

763
00:24:12,494 --> 00:24:14,596
"It's okay, Mom."
"It's okay, Dad."

764
00:24:14,596 --> 00:24:16,564
But a part of me sometimes,

765
00:24:16,598 --> 00:24:17,599
is really not okay.

766
00:24:17,866 --> 00:24:18,833
Same, I

767
00:24:18,867 --> 00:24:20,702
relate to that so much.

768
00:24:20,735 --> 00:24:22,237
- Whenever they call me
- I'm so sorry.

769
00:24:22,237 --> 00:24:24,038
and like if I'm not okay,

770
00:24:24,038 --> 00:24:24,973
I just say

771
00:24:24,973 --> 00:24:28,176
- like, I'm okay. Everything's fine.
- That you're okay.

772
00:24:28,209 --> 00:24:29,978
I'm not sick or anything but

773
00:24:30,044 --> 00:24:32,413
I have to lie to them to make them know,

774
00:24:32,614 --> 00:24:34,382
that they don't need to worry.

775
00:24:34,516 --> 00:24:35,783
And then today,

776
00:24:36,384 --> 00:24:37,585
we are filming.

777
00:24:37,619 --> 00:24:38,753
So they're going to see us

778
00:24:39,654 --> 00:24:41,222
enjoy our time.

779
00:24:41,356 --> 00:24:44,025
- For sure.
- I want to stop fucking crying, girls.

780
00:24:44,058 --> 00:24:46,828
This is going to be an amazing opportunity for them.

781
00:24:46,828 --> 00:24:47,996
They work their ass off

782
00:24:47,996 --> 00:24:49,330
and they're getting to experience

783
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:50,665
joy and some drag,

784
00:24:50,665 --> 00:24:53,101
some glitter and some sparkles in their life.

785
00:24:57,906 --> 00:24:59,641
Hi, Siam!

786
00:24:59,641 --> 00:25:01,476
Mabuhay!

787
00:25:01,476 --> 00:25:03,845
Mother, welcome back!

788
00:25:03,845 --> 00:25:05,747
No pictures, please.

789
00:25:05,747 --> 00:25:07,181
It's a new day in the Werkroom.

790
00:25:07,181 --> 00:25:08,883
We are about to hit the Runway

791
00:25:08,917 --> 00:25:09,684
for the makeover,

792
00:25:09,684 --> 00:25:11,619
and we feel fantastic.

793
00:25:11,853 --> 00:25:13,988
What do you want your drag name to be?

794
00:25:13,988 --> 00:25:16,624
Still, I'm going to stick with my

795
00:25:16,658 --> 00:25:17,759
beautiful name,

796
00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:20,261
Bevalicious!

797
00:25:21,296 --> 00:25:22,196
We're very excited.

798
00:25:22,196 --> 00:25:23,998
Because it's about time

799
00:25:23,998 --> 00:25:25,233
that she's rewarded

800
00:25:25,233 --> 00:25:26,267
for all the hard work

801
00:25:26,267 --> 00:25:27,802
that she's been doing for

802
00:25:27,802 --> 00:25:29,671
the whole OFW community.

803
00:25:29,871 --> 00:25:31,806
Bevalicious D!

804
00:25:31,806 --> 00:25:32,807
D for what?

805
00:25:32,807 --> 00:25:33,708
D for

806
00:25:33,708 --> 00:25:35,109
dick.

807
00:25:36,344 --> 00:25:39,247
Bevily is our Mommy Bevalicious.

808
00:25:39,247 --> 00:25:40,315
Her energy is so positive.

809
00:25:40,315 --> 00:25:42,250
Everything she's telling us, we're absorbing.

810
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:43,184
And we wanna be sure that

811
00:25:43,217 --> 00:25:45,353
we are just representing her best aspect

812
00:25:45,353 --> 00:25:46,554
in this makeover.

813
00:25:46,921 --> 00:25:48,323
I'm really inspired also

814
00:25:48,323 --> 00:25:49,290
with you guys,

815
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:50,758
because you're still

816
00:25:50,758 --> 00:25:52,393
very young and you are

817
00:25:52,427 --> 00:25:55,029
- helping your family already.
- Yeah.

818
00:25:55,396 --> 00:25:56,464
You're also

819
00:25:56,497 --> 00:25:57,999
heroes in your own,

820
00:25:57,999 --> 00:25:59,367
small,

821
00:25:59,367 --> 00:26:00,568
natural way.

822
00:26:00,568 --> 00:26:01,803
Yeah.

823
00:26:01,803 --> 00:26:04,238
Your mothers should be very proud of you.

824
00:26:04,238 --> 00:26:06,941
- Who is Hermhie?
- Hermhie is,

825
00:26:06,941 --> 00:26:08,242
a fighter.

826
00:26:10,211 --> 00:26:11,179
Am I right?

827
00:26:11,179 --> 00:26:12,947
Hermhie is THE fighter.

828
00:26:12,947 --> 00:26:14,182
What I realized,

829
00:26:14,182 --> 00:26:17,885
from all Mama Ermie's stories, is to be strong.

830
00:26:17,885 --> 00:26:20,555
You always have to have courage in your heart.

831
00:26:20,555 --> 00:26:22,557
I'm really thankful that

832
00:26:23,424 --> 00:26:24,759
I became a part of

833
00:26:24,759 --> 00:26:25,693
your team.

834
00:26:26,961 --> 00:26:27,795
Mama, you're too much.

835
00:26:27,795 --> 00:26:28,997
Are you happy with us?

836
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:29,764
Of course!

837
00:26:29,764 --> 00:26:30,565
Huh?

838
00:26:30,565 --> 00:26:31,099
Yeah.

839
00:26:31,132 --> 00:26:32,000
We're not.

840
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,267
Joke!

841
00:26:33,267 --> 00:26:35,136
Oh, my God then that's just sad.

842
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:37,672
I see the joy and excitement,

843
00:26:37,672 --> 00:26:38,906
in mama Ermie’s eyes.

844
00:26:38,906 --> 00:26:40,642
How did you meet each other?

845
00:26:40,642 --> 00:26:43,611
Bernie and I met each other,

846
00:26:44,078 --> 00:26:46,080
in a gay bar. Kidding!

847
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,984
We were both part of Drag Race Philippines Season 2.

848
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:54,389
- We knew each other, but we weren't friends.
- We weren't friends.

849
00:26:54,589 --> 00:26:56,991
I never expected us out of everyone would be the close ones.

850
00:26:56,991 --> 00:26:58,860
Ever since we've been out,

851
00:26:58,926 --> 00:27:02,997
I never thought we'd become so close.

852
00:27:02,997 --> 00:27:05,733
We went on a trip to Tagaytay before coming here.

853
00:27:05,733 --> 00:27:07,835
- Oh right!
- We went to Tagaytay right.

854
00:27:07,835 --> 00:27:10,505
We went to Tagaytay, because we’re manifesting,

855
00:27:10,505 --> 00:27:14,475
beautiful outcomes in life.

856
00:27:14,475 --> 00:27:15,677
Even before this.

857
00:27:15,677 --> 00:27:17,979
It’s nice to bring

858
00:27:17,979 --> 00:27:19,447
the joy in drag

859
00:27:19,447 --> 00:27:21,516
and share it with other people.

860
00:27:23,184 --> 00:27:24,485
- Alright!
- That's how you do it!

861
00:27:24,485 --> 00:27:25,687
Did I just hit her?!

862
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:27,722
Sorry, sorry.

863
00:27:52,947 --> 00:27:54,549
Mabuheeey!

864
00:27:54,549 --> 00:27:56,417
I am your mothertucking host,

865
00:27:56,451 --> 00:27:57,985
and welcome to the Main Stage of

866
00:27:58,052 --> 00:28:01,522
Drag Race Philippines: Slaysian Royale.

867
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:03,858
We'll love her forever,

868
00:28:03,891 --> 00:28:05,226
but not today.

869
00:28:05,493 --> 00:28:07,595
The winner of Drag Race Philippines, Season 2,

870
00:28:07,595 --> 00:28:09,363
Captivating Katkat.

871
00:28:09,731 --> 00:28:11,032
Welcome back, Katkat.

872
00:28:11,399 --> 00:28:13,434
This is a homecoming for you, too.

873
00:28:13,735 --> 00:28:15,269
Did you miss the stage?

874
00:28:15,636 --> 00:28:16,904
Of course,

875
00:28:16,904 --> 00:28:18,306
I'm happy to be back,

876
00:28:18,306 --> 00:28:19,874
back, back again.

877
00:28:19,874 --> 00:28:21,242
This is the stage that made

878
00:28:21,242 --> 00:28:23,311
all my dreams come true.

879
00:28:23,344 --> 00:28:24,245
I'm so happy and

880
00:28:24,245 --> 00:28:26,781
honored to be here, Mama Pao.

881
00:28:27,081 --> 00:28:28,216
That's so lovely.

882
00:28:28,249 --> 00:28:30,118
Thank you, Captivating KatKat.

883
00:28:30,118 --> 00:28:32,286
Next, our extra special guest judge,

884
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,989
Drag Grace Global All Stars Winner,

885
00:28:35,022 --> 00:28:36,157
the iconic,

886
00:28:36,157 --> 00:28:38,059
Alyssa Edwards!

887
00:28:38,059 --> 00:28:39,727
Your mother is a queen,

888
00:28:39,727 --> 00:28:41,229
Mama Pao!

889
00:28:41,596 --> 00:28:43,831
Alyssa. If a balikbayan box

890
00:28:43,831 --> 00:28:45,500
landed at your doorstep,

891
00:28:45,533 --> 00:28:47,034
what surprise inside,

892
00:28:47,068 --> 00:28:49,670
would have you hollering like a banshee?

893
00:28:50,638 --> 00:28:52,006
Alright now.

894
00:28:52,073 --> 00:28:53,274
Well, if that box is stuffed

895
00:28:53,274 --> 00:28:54,742
with some wigs, lashes,

896
00:28:54,742 --> 00:28:56,444
and a cinched-to-the-gods corset,

897
00:28:56,644 --> 00:28:58,146
you can consider me shipped,

898
00:28:58,146 --> 00:29:00,214
signed, sealed and delivered.

899
00:29:00,314 --> 00:29:01,315
Well with that list,

900
00:29:01,315 --> 00:29:03,551
we better slap a fragile sticker on it.

901
00:29:03,885 --> 00:29:05,720
Because that package is serving

902
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:06,954
precious cargo.

903
00:29:07,088 --> 00:29:08,523
Thank you, Alyssa.

904
00:29:08,823 --> 00:29:10,258
For this week's challenge,

905
00:29:10,258 --> 00:29:11,392
the queens were tasked

906
00:29:11,392 --> 00:29:13,161
with transforming our beloved

907
00:29:13,161 --> 00:29:14,862
Overseas Filipino Workers

908
00:29:14,862 --> 00:29:16,697
as part of their family

909
00:29:16,697 --> 00:29:18,266
in a once in a lifetime event

910
00:29:18,266 --> 00:29:19,600
on Drag Race.

911
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,803
Their Homecoming Gala Night.

912
00:29:22,804 --> 00:29:23,771
Racers,

913
00:29:23,805 --> 00:29:25,439
start your engines,

914
00:29:25,473 --> 00:29:26,541
and may the best

915
00:29:26,541 --> 00:29:29,177
Slaysian queen, win!

916
00:29:31,879 --> 00:29:33,314
Category is...

917
00:29:33,347 --> 00:29:35,416
Homecoming Gala Night.

918
00:29:35,416 --> 00:29:36,584
Starting with,

919
00:29:36,617 --> 00:29:39,620
Viñas DeLuxe and Khianna with

920
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:42,089
Mariah Ozawa.

921
00:29:42,323 --> 00:29:43,724
Oh, wow.

922
00:29:44,625 --> 00:29:46,727
All I want for Christmas

923
00:29:46,727 --> 00:29:48,429
is drag!

924
00:29:48,629 --> 00:29:50,198
So we're in the Runway,

925
00:29:50,198 --> 00:29:52,567
and I'm with Mommy Christine,

926
00:29:52,567 --> 00:29:54,101
and Khianna as

927
00:29:54,101 --> 00:29:55,837
Mariah with a K,

928
00:29:55,837 --> 00:29:57,538
Mariah Makiling,

929
00:29:57,572 --> 00:30:00,441
and Mariah Ozawa.

930
00:30:00,441 --> 00:30:02,310
Fierce, right?

931
00:30:03,644 --> 00:30:05,379
I don't know if this world is large enough

932
00:30:05,413 --> 00:30:06,781
for three Mariahs.

933
00:30:06,781 --> 00:30:08,316
- Oh, good catch!
- Yeah.

934
00:30:08,316 --> 00:30:10,184
This outfit is not just about the

935
00:30:10,184 --> 00:30:11,919
makeup transformation

936
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:12,787
for a drag queen.

937
00:30:12,787 --> 00:30:14,922
We are on another level of being a drag queen.

938
00:30:14,956 --> 00:30:15,723
This is

939
00:30:15,723 --> 00:30:17,859
impersonation.

940
00:30:17,892 --> 00:30:21,929
We are the Three Mariahs.

941
00:30:22,797 --> 00:30:24,165
We are the past,

942
00:30:24,165 --> 00:30:25,900
present, and future.

943
00:30:28,502 --> 00:30:30,872
Brigiding and Suki Doll with

944
00:30:30,905 --> 00:30:32,673
Bevalicious D!

945
00:30:33,574 --> 00:30:36,277
As we honor our modern-day heroes,

946
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:38,012
the OFWs,

947
00:30:38,045 --> 00:30:39,747
we also want to pay homage

948
00:30:39,747 --> 00:30:42,216
to the Philippine National Flag.

949
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:43,784
Gold and yellow,

950
00:30:43,784 --> 00:30:45,486
representing freedom.

951
00:30:45,486 --> 00:30:47,121
Red for bravery.

952
00:30:47,154 --> 00:30:48,122
And blue

953
00:30:48,155 --> 00:30:51,058
for peace, justice, and beauty.

954
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:55,796
What...

955
00:30:56,063 --> 00:30:57,732
Werk!

956
00:30:59,467 --> 00:31:00,968
We wanted to do a dance

957
00:31:00,968 --> 00:31:02,536
to celebrate the Pinay

958
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:03,871
flag creation,

959
00:31:03,905 --> 00:31:05,673
and the ceremonial part of it.

960
00:31:07,541 --> 00:31:08,409
Ladies and gentlemen,

961
00:31:08,409 --> 00:31:10,511
the primary colors.

962
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:13,047
Hey!

963
00:31:13,481 --> 00:31:15,716
Not so lady-like!

964
00:31:16,984 --> 00:31:17,985
Go home!

965
00:31:21,989 --> 00:31:24,425
Arizona Brandy and Bernie with

966
00:31:24,458 --> 00:31:26,127
Hermhie!

967
00:31:27,962 --> 00:31:29,463
While walking the Runway,

968
00:31:29,463 --> 00:31:32,400
We're giving Lavinia energy.
(An iconic Filipina villain)

969
00:31:32,466 --> 00:31:33,067
Like...

970
00:31:34,135 --> 00:31:34,635
“Who do you think you are?”

971
00:31:34,635 --> 00:31:35,836
Like that!

972
00:31:35,836 --> 00:31:37,672
This Runway, we're serving

973
00:31:37,705 --> 00:31:39,674
the 80s' villains.

974
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:41,676
This time, we have the power.

975
00:31:41,676 --> 00:31:43,911
We are reclaiming that power.

976
00:31:43,945 --> 00:31:45,346
You're nothing

977
00:31:45,346 --> 00:31:46,881
but a second-rate...

978
00:31:46,881 --> 00:31:48,282
...trying hard,

979
00:31:48,349 --> 00:31:49,317
copycat!

980
00:31:52,386 --> 00:31:54,555
CHEERS!

981
00:31:55,056 --> 00:31:56,557
This Runway represents

982
00:31:56,557 --> 00:31:59,827
how OFWs have to be strong,

983
00:31:59,827 --> 00:32:01,762
resilient,

984
00:32:01,762 --> 00:32:04,398
and extremely brave, in other countries.

985
00:32:12,006 --> 00:32:14,475
Siam Phusri and Yuhua with

986
00:32:14,542 --> 00:32:16,978
Mehua Phusri!

987
00:32:18,779 --> 00:32:20,448
Oh!

988
00:32:21,549 --> 00:32:23,217
Hello, everyone!

989
00:32:23,217 --> 00:32:24,485
How are you?

990
00:32:24,485 --> 00:32:26,887
Am I beautiful?

991
00:32:26,887 --> 00:32:28,389
Hello, in Chinese,

992
00:32:28,389 --> 00:32:31,392
because I would love to ask all Chinese fans,

993
00:32:31,392 --> 00:32:32,626
am I beautiful?

994
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:34,061
Because I look very

995
00:32:34,095 --> 00:32:36,998
traditional Chinese woman right now.

996
00:32:36,998 --> 00:32:37,732
Look at me.

997
00:32:37,732 --> 00:32:38,799
Look at the hair.

998
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:40,368
Look at the dress.

999
00:32:41,535 --> 00:32:42,837
Do you love this place?

1000
00:32:42,837 --> 00:32:44,071
Stop!

1001
00:32:44,605 --> 00:32:47,641
Mehua Phusri is serving it, baby!

1002
00:32:47,675 --> 00:32:49,143
She is serving us power.

1003
00:32:49,143 --> 00:32:50,711
She is serving us Empress,

1004
00:32:50,745 --> 00:32:51,445
and in the back,

1005
00:32:51,445 --> 00:32:53,714
Siam and I are just fighting.

1006
00:32:53,714 --> 00:32:54,515
Fighting.

1007
00:32:54,548 --> 00:32:57,018
It reflects the concubines in the ancient times,

1008
00:32:57,051 --> 00:32:57,952
perfectly,

1009
00:32:57,952 --> 00:32:59,487
with a comedic style.

1010
00:33:04,325 --> 00:33:06,193
Welcome back, ladies.

1011
00:33:06,227 --> 00:33:08,562
We want to take a heartfelt moment

1012
00:33:08,562 --> 00:33:10,664
to once again honor and thank

1013
00:33:10,664 --> 00:33:13,167
our incredible OFWs.

1014
00:33:13,434 --> 00:33:14,702
We see you,

1015
00:33:14,735 --> 00:33:16,670
we celebrate you, and

1016
00:33:16,670 --> 00:33:19,573
we salute you with all our hearts.

1017
00:33:19,573 --> 00:33:20,441
Thank you.

1018
00:33:21,075 --> 00:33:24,011
Now it's time for the judges' critiques.

1019
00:33:24,245 --> 00:33:25,513
For this challenge,

1020
00:33:25,546 --> 00:33:27,848
Queens, you will be judged as a group.

1021
00:33:27,848 --> 00:33:28,716
Okay?

1022
00:33:28,816 --> 00:33:30,117
First up,

1023
00:33:30,251 --> 00:33:33,320
this is Christine Salta before and

1024
00:33:33,354 --> 00:33:34,889
this is her now.

1025
00:33:34,922 --> 00:33:37,525
Mariah Ozawa.

1026
00:33:37,558 --> 00:33:39,393
This was absolutely fantastic.

1027
00:33:39,427 --> 00:33:40,528
This was a spectacle

1028
00:33:40,528 --> 00:33:42,263
from beginning to end.

1029
00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:43,497
There were so many things

1030
00:33:43,497 --> 00:33:45,166
about this that I loved.

1031
00:33:45,232 --> 00:33:47,401
I would buy a ticket to this

1032
00:33:47,401 --> 00:33:49,403
Mariah Carey concert.

1033
00:33:50,171 --> 00:33:51,572
Especially because

1034
00:33:51,605 --> 00:33:54,041
we had the Queen Mariah.

1035
00:33:54,108 --> 00:33:55,176
The mother herself.

1036
00:33:55,209 --> 00:33:56,410
- Yes.
- Thank you.

1037
00:33:56,644 --> 00:33:58,546
I love the presentation.

1038
00:33:58,546 --> 00:34:01,282
It's so much fun and goofy.

1039
00:34:01,315 --> 00:34:03,451
I love Mother Ozawa

1040
00:34:03,451 --> 00:34:05,853
having so much fun on stage.

1041
00:34:05,853 --> 00:34:08,989
The emancipation of me, me, me.

1042
00:34:09,623 --> 00:34:10,724
Are you a performer?

1043
00:34:10,724 --> 00:34:11,926
Is this what you do?

1044
00:34:11,959 --> 00:34:15,329
I started at 18 years old actually.

1045
00:34:15,362 --> 00:34:17,431
- In Japan, right?
- Yeah. in Japan.

1046
00:34:17,431 --> 00:34:20,334
And how did you feel tonight?

1047
00:34:20,334 --> 00:34:22,436
In full drag,

1048
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:25,573
on the Main Stage of Drag Race?

1049
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:28,075
It's very amazing.

1050
00:34:28,142 --> 00:34:29,043
Fantastic.

1051
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:31,245
I will never forget this.

1052
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,281
Thank you very much.

1053
00:34:34,415 --> 00:34:36,917
Now, this is Bevily Devis before

1054
00:34:36,917 --> 00:34:38,652
and this is her now.

1055
00:34:38,686 --> 00:34:40,921
Bevalicious D!

1056
00:34:40,955 --> 00:34:42,256
I think that

1057
00:34:42,289 --> 00:34:43,824
from head to toe,

1058
00:34:43,824 --> 00:34:45,693
this was a finished look.

1059
00:34:45,726 --> 00:34:47,194
But beyond the look,

1060
00:34:47,194 --> 00:34:48,896
I think the story

1061
00:34:48,896 --> 00:34:51,365
is so remarkably beautiful

1062
00:34:51,398 --> 00:34:52,666
and touching.

1063
00:34:52,666 --> 00:34:55,102
And Bevalicious D,

1064
00:34:55,169 --> 00:34:57,304
this is the embodiment

1065
00:34:57,371 --> 00:34:59,573
of who I hope to be one day.

1066
00:34:59,673 --> 00:35:01,442
I was blown away.

1067
00:35:01,475 --> 00:35:03,911
Yeah. You're so gorgeous, Mother.

1068
00:35:03,944 --> 00:35:04,945
And to my sisters,

1069
00:35:04,945 --> 00:35:06,180
Brigiding and Suki,

1070
00:35:06,213 --> 00:35:07,982
may I ask who did the costumes

1071
00:35:07,982 --> 00:35:08,949
and the hair?

1072
00:35:08,983 --> 00:35:10,751
So, this is

1073
00:35:10,751 --> 00:35:12,920
the costumes that I have prepared.

1074
00:35:12,953 --> 00:35:14,955
And Suki Doll,

1075
00:35:14,955 --> 00:35:16,056
did the accessorizing,

1076
00:35:16,056 --> 00:35:17,558
the styling, the hair.

1077
00:35:17,558 --> 00:35:19,460
And the fixing of the hem line,

1078
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:20,461
to adjust everything

1079
00:35:20,461 --> 00:35:22,129
so it could fit the three of us.

1080
00:35:22,129 --> 00:35:25,266
When it came to the concept of OFW,

1081
00:35:25,299 --> 00:35:26,133
we wanted to respect

1082
00:35:26,167 --> 00:35:27,401
and also honor the culture

1083
00:35:27,401 --> 00:35:29,136
and obviously the workforce

1084
00:35:29,136 --> 00:35:30,604
and independent mothers.

1085
00:35:30,604 --> 00:35:32,039
So we decided to go

1086
00:35:32,039 --> 00:35:33,140
in this direction.

1087
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:34,175
And obviously this is like

1088
00:35:34,175 --> 00:35:34,909
my coming out.

1089
00:35:34,909 --> 00:35:36,477
I was very scared

1090
00:35:36,477 --> 00:35:38,445
as a Filipina maiden.

1091
00:35:38,445 --> 00:35:39,980
Filipina maiden!

1092
00:35:40,114 --> 00:35:42,383
I loved the presentation and

1093
00:35:42,383 --> 00:35:43,484
the costumes.

1094
00:35:43,517 --> 00:35:45,252
It blends well.

1095
00:35:45,286 --> 00:35:46,453
And,

1096
00:35:46,453 --> 00:35:49,223
the overall look is so amazing.

1097
00:35:49,223 --> 00:35:51,025
You are my top for tonight.

1098
00:35:51,058 --> 00:35:53,794
Awww. Thank you.

1099
00:35:53,827 --> 00:35:56,297
How are you, Bevalicious D?

1100
00:35:56,330 --> 00:35:58,966
I feel so proud

1101
00:35:58,999 --> 00:36:00,701
with my two daughters here.

1102
00:36:01,502 --> 00:36:02,603
My children.

1103
00:36:03,237 --> 00:36:04,271
And...

1104
00:36:04,438 --> 00:36:05,139
Sorry.

1105
00:36:06,807 --> 00:36:08,709
I always tell them that

1106
00:36:09,043 --> 00:36:11,445
heroes don't wear capes only.

1107
00:36:11,478 --> 00:36:12,446
They wear

1108
00:36:12,479 --> 00:36:13,480
gowns.

1109
00:36:14,748 --> 00:36:16,750
Fabulous gowns.

1110
00:36:16,784 --> 00:36:17,885
It's really good.

1111
00:36:17,952 --> 00:36:19,086
Congratulations.

1112
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:20,521
Thank you, Mama Pao.

1113
00:36:20,554 --> 00:36:21,655
What does the D mean?

1114
00:36:21,689 --> 00:36:23,123
What does the D mean?

1115
00:36:23,123 --> 00:36:24,358
It's BIG

1116
00:36:24,358 --> 00:36:25,025
DIRTY

1117
00:36:25,025 --> 00:36:25,859
DICK.

1118
00:36:28,262 --> 00:36:29,630
Bevalicious D!

1119
00:36:31,498 --> 00:36:32,967
- No, kidding aside,
- I love it!

1120
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,069
it's Bevalicious

1121
00:36:35,202 --> 00:36:35,970
Doll

1122
00:36:36,003 --> 00:36:36,537
Ding.

1123
00:36:36,537 --> 00:36:38,105
Or Ding-Doll.

1124
00:36:38,138 --> 00:36:39,773
Oh! Suki Doll and Brigiding.

1125
00:36:39,807 --> 00:36:41,775
I thought you were a biter too, mother!

1126
00:36:44,445 --> 00:36:46,480
Bevalicious D, thank you very much.

1127
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,082
for your dirty dick.

1128
00:36:49,483 --> 00:36:51,485
Next up, we have

1129
00:36:51,518 --> 00:36:53,320
Ermie Caoile before

1130
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,589
and this is her now.

1131
00:36:55,656 --> 00:36:56,924
Hermhie!

1132
00:36:56,957 --> 00:36:59,393
Hello, my Season 2 sisters!

1133
00:36:59,426 --> 00:37:00,394
- Oh, my God.
- Hi.

1134
00:37:00,394 --> 00:37:03,464
Good to see you again!

1135
00:37:03,530 --> 00:37:04,098
Oh, my God.

1136
00:37:04,098 --> 00:37:05,532
Because of that, you know

1137
00:37:05,566 --> 00:37:07,234
I do believe in the saying that

1138
00:37:07,268 --> 00:37:09,270
if you don't have anything good to say,

1139
00:37:09,303 --> 00:37:10,638
just shut the fuck up.

1140
00:37:10,671 --> 00:37:11,805
Oh, my God.

1141
00:37:12,072 --> 00:37:13,641
So, that's it.

1142
00:37:13,641 --> 00:37:15,109
Thank you, Mama Pao.

1143
00:37:15,676 --> 00:37:17,344
Oh!

1144
00:37:17,344 --> 00:37:19,480
Well, I just want to ask

1145
00:37:19,513 --> 00:37:21,315
our mother, Hermhie.

1146
00:37:21,315 --> 00:37:21,782
Yes?

1147
00:37:21,782 --> 00:37:24,618
How's your experience on doing this drag?

1148
00:37:24,685 --> 00:37:25,352
I love it.

1149
00:37:25,953 --> 00:37:28,022
This is my first time.

1150
00:37:28,055 --> 00:37:30,057
So, thank you to these,

1151
00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:31,325
beautiful ladies,

1152
00:37:31,859 --> 00:37:34,094
for creating me

1153
00:37:34,261 --> 00:37:36,563
as Hermhie.

1154
00:37:36,563 --> 00:37:37,464
The way you performed

1155
00:37:37,464 --> 00:37:39,266
on stage today,

1156
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:40,434
is really good.

1157
00:37:40,501 --> 00:37:41,135
Thank you.

1158
00:37:41,135 --> 00:37:42,136
This is

1159
00:37:42,136 --> 00:37:45,306
the definition of 80's villains.

1160
00:37:45,339 --> 00:37:47,474
I got the Supremes,

1161
00:37:47,474 --> 00:37:49,276
I got the Dream Girls.

1162
00:37:49,276 --> 00:37:51,545
- Dynasty.
- Dynasty!

1163
00:37:51,578 --> 00:37:52,813
You had this energy

1164
00:37:52,846 --> 00:37:54,148
and air about you

1165
00:37:54,181 --> 00:37:55,683
that was so memorable

1166
00:37:55,683 --> 00:37:57,251
and electrifying.

1167
00:37:57,284 --> 00:37:59,119
Do you have a motivation,

1168
00:37:59,586 --> 00:38:00,587
when you

1169
00:38:00,654 --> 00:38:01,588
walked in there and

1170
00:38:01,588 --> 00:38:02,790
you're so proud and

1171
00:38:02,790 --> 00:38:04,058
I'm this character?

1172
00:38:04,058 --> 00:38:06,093
Before, I have an

1173
00:38:06,193 --> 00:38:08,495
experience in Hong Kong.

1174
00:38:08,562 --> 00:38:10,631
My first employer,

1175
00:38:11,031 --> 00:38:13,200
they abused me.

1176
00:38:13,534 --> 00:38:15,169
They said,

1177
00:38:15,369 --> 00:38:17,438
Filipinas are dirty,

1178
00:38:17,504 --> 00:38:18,839
dirty people

1179
00:38:18,839 --> 00:38:21,775
because we are OFW.

1180
00:38:22,042 --> 00:38:22,976
So,

1181
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:24,511
with my boss, I could not,

1182
00:38:24,545 --> 00:38:26,847
I could not touch the baby.

1183
00:38:27,247 --> 00:38:29,817
I just looked after them.

1184
00:38:30,117 --> 00:38:31,819
After they eat,

1185
00:38:32,219 --> 00:38:33,754
they forget that

1186
00:38:33,787 --> 00:38:35,556
they have a helper.

1187
00:38:35,622 --> 00:38:37,424
So I needed to

1188
00:38:37,424 --> 00:38:38,726
sacrifice.

1189
00:38:39,193 --> 00:38:41,729
A lot of Overseas Filipino Workers

1190
00:38:41,762 --> 00:38:44,331
usually have this kind of story

1191
00:38:44,765 --> 00:38:46,433
Some of us kids, were left

1192
00:38:46,467 --> 00:38:47,901
back home were

1193
00:38:47,901 --> 00:38:48,936
taking advantage of

1194
00:38:48,936 --> 00:38:50,971
the fact that they're not here.

1195
00:38:51,004 --> 00:38:52,606
And,

1196
00:38:52,606 --> 00:38:54,341
without even thinking that

1197
00:38:54,375 --> 00:38:56,343
their sacrifices

1198
00:38:56,443 --> 00:38:57,544
they're doing this

1199
00:38:57,578 --> 00:39:00,481
for those of us that they love back home.

1200
00:39:00,481 --> 00:39:02,750
So, we just want to say thank you, and

1201
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:04,385
one day we'll be like Hermhie

1202
00:39:04,385 --> 00:39:06,053
and be the villain herself.

1203
00:39:06,053 --> 00:39:07,554
With a wine glass and

1204
00:39:09,656 --> 00:39:10,858
laughing like this.

1205
00:39:10,858 --> 00:39:12,192
I love it!

1206
00:39:12,226 --> 00:39:13,360
Yes.

1207
00:39:13,394 --> 00:39:15,662
Thank you very much, Hermhie.

1208
00:39:15,696 --> 00:39:16,930
Okay, next up.

1209
00:39:16,930 --> 00:39:19,099
This is Angelique Parungao before

1210
00:39:19,099 --> 00:39:20,567
and this is her now.

1211
00:39:20,601 --> 00:39:22,569
Mehua Phusri!

1212
00:39:22,569 --> 00:39:24,538
I love the idea that you combined

1213
00:39:24,538 --> 00:39:26,407
both traditions and cultures.

1214
00:39:26,407 --> 00:39:28,542
And thank you so much for sharing

1215
00:39:28,542 --> 00:39:30,210
your cultures here and

1216
00:39:30,210 --> 00:39:31,812
also in the presentation

1217
00:39:31,812 --> 00:39:33,547
you had so much fun.

1218
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:35,015
And also the makeup,

1219
00:39:35,015 --> 00:39:35,816
I love it.

1220
00:39:35,816 --> 00:39:37,885
And congratulations.

1221
00:39:37,885 --> 00:39:39,520
Okay, so I love this one.

1222
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,587
I kind of felt like

1223
00:39:40,587 --> 00:39:42,723
I was watching,

1224
00:39:42,723 --> 00:39:46,593
- Cinderella with her two evil stepsisters.
- Yeah.

1225
00:39:46,593 --> 00:39:49,863
I thought the colors were vibrant.

1226
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:50,764
I loved how you all were

1227
00:39:50,764 --> 00:39:52,332
in and out of character.

1228
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:53,867
And truly

1229
00:39:53,901 --> 00:39:56,370
it was very obvious who the star was.

1230
00:39:56,370 --> 00:39:59,106
- Who the Homecoming empress was,
- Yes, of course.

1231
00:39:59,106 --> 00:40:00,641
it was very clear

1232
00:40:00,641 --> 00:40:02,443
from start to finish.

1233
00:40:02,509 --> 00:40:04,077
Bravo to all of you.

1234
00:40:04,211 --> 00:40:06,513
Merging your concepts,

1235
00:40:06,547 --> 00:40:08,115
it was messy.

1236
00:40:08,115 --> 00:40:10,317
But it was so memorable

1237
00:40:10,317 --> 00:40:12,386
and that's what we loved about your group.

1238
00:40:12,419 --> 00:40:14,221
- I'm so happy.
- Thank you.

1239
00:40:14,388 --> 00:40:16,690
I've been a fan of the show for so long.

1240
00:40:17,157 --> 00:40:18,725
And to be on the stage

1241
00:40:18,725 --> 00:40:19,960
is so electrifying.

1242
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:23,130
Electrifying?!

1243
00:40:25,499 --> 00:40:27,167
Thank you.

1244
00:40:27,167 --> 00:40:27,901
Once again,

1245
00:40:27,901 --> 00:40:29,470
let's give a round of applause

1246
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:30,904
for our amazing

1247
00:40:30,904 --> 00:40:33,740
OFW’s!

1248
00:40:35,175 --> 00:40:36,477
Now let us get back

1249
00:40:36,477 --> 00:40:38,512
to business, ladies.

1250
00:40:39,079 --> 00:40:42,883
We have made some decisions.

1251
00:40:44,151 --> 00:40:47,588
Siam Phusri and Yuhua.

1252
00:40:48,522 --> 00:40:50,858
You are safe.

1253
00:40:51,792 --> 00:40:54,928
Khianna and Viñas DeLuxe.

1254
00:40:55,662 --> 00:40:57,598
You are safe.

1255
00:40:57,598 --> 00:40:59,833
Ahh! Is it really true?!

1256
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:00,601
No, it's just a joke!

1257
00:41:00,601 --> 00:41:01,935
Yes, you are safe.

1258
00:41:01,935 --> 00:41:02,603
For real.

1259
00:41:03,070 --> 00:41:04,938
You did well too.

1260
00:41:05,005 --> 00:41:06,540
Fly high, Pinays!

1261
00:41:06,974 --> 00:41:08,308
Shit.

1262
00:41:08,342 --> 00:41:09,977
Brigiding.

1263
00:41:10,244 --> 00:41:12,479
Suki Doll.

1264
00:41:15,883 --> 00:41:17,451
Condragulations!

1265
00:41:17,451 --> 00:41:18,752
You are the winning group

1266
00:41:18,986 --> 00:41:21,555
of this week's challenge.

1267
00:41:21,655 --> 00:41:24,758
You are the Top 2 Slaysians of the week.

1268
00:41:25,759 --> 00:41:28,228
With Bevalicious D!

1269
00:41:28,228 --> 00:41:29,530
Thank you.

1270
00:41:29,563 --> 00:41:30,364
This means,

1271
00:41:30,364 --> 00:41:32,199
I'm sorry, Bernie

1272
00:41:32,199 --> 00:41:34,167
and Arizona Brandy.

1273
00:41:34,201 --> 00:41:36,537
You are the Bottom 2 queens

1274
00:41:36,603 --> 00:41:38,505
of the week.

1275
00:41:38,839 --> 00:41:40,440
Queens Brigiding and Suki Doll,

1276
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:42,576
each of you need to decide

1277
00:41:42,643 --> 00:41:43,744
which of the Bottom 2

1278
00:41:43,744 --> 00:41:44,811
you'll eliminate

1279
00:41:44,811 --> 00:41:46,880
if you win the lip sync.

1280
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:48,649
So while you, Queens

1281
00:41:48,682 --> 00:41:51,318
deliberate and untuck in the Werkroom,

1282
00:41:51,418 --> 00:41:53,153
the judges and I

1283
00:41:53,186 --> 00:41:55,355
will have therapy.

1284
00:41:55,389 --> 00:41:58,191
We'll have an intense game of Sungka.

1285
00:41:58,225 --> 00:42:01,962
You may leave the stage and evaporate,

1286
00:42:02,162 --> 00:42:04,131
and resuscitate,

1287
00:42:04,131 --> 00:42:06,033
and reincarnate.

1288
00:42:12,539 --> 00:42:14,007
Oh! Red and blue.

1289
00:42:14,007 --> 00:42:17,978
- Red and blue!
- Werk!

1290
00:42:17,978 --> 00:42:20,013
The bootleg version!

1291
00:42:20,714 --> 00:42:22,115
It feels good because

1292
00:42:22,115 --> 00:42:24,418
the judges saw

1293
00:42:24,418 --> 00:42:24,918
all the effort.

1294
00:42:25,586 --> 00:42:27,087
So how do we feel?

1295
00:42:27,688 --> 00:42:28,689
It feels great.

1296
00:42:28,689 --> 00:42:30,057
Because during my season,

1297
00:42:30,057 --> 00:42:31,625
I left because

1298
00:42:31,658 --> 00:42:33,126
my partner

1299
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:34,494
was more beautiful than me.

1300
00:42:34,494 --> 00:42:35,662
That's what they said.

1301
00:42:35,796 --> 00:42:36,530
Yeah!

1302
00:42:36,997 --> 00:42:38,565
So to be at the top,

1303
00:42:38,599 --> 00:42:40,167
it's a good feeling.

1304
00:42:40,334 --> 00:42:42,202
And to be sharing it with Suki,

1305
00:42:42,202 --> 00:42:43,403
is so beautiful.

1306
00:42:43,437 --> 00:42:45,372
Bridiging and Suki

1307
00:42:45,372 --> 00:42:46,573
deserve to be on top.

1308
00:42:46,607 --> 00:42:50,377
That was a good Runway.

1309
00:42:50,444 --> 00:42:52,446
And the presentation,

1310
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:53,880
I love it.

1311
00:42:54,147 --> 00:42:55,549
Being on the top for an episode

1312
00:42:55,616 --> 00:42:57,084
where mothers are celebrated

1313
00:42:57,084 --> 00:42:58,585
means the world to me because

1314
00:42:58,619 --> 00:43:00,253
my drag is to celebrate my mother.

1315
00:43:00,253 --> 00:43:01,922
It's a love letter to my mother and

1316
00:43:01,955 --> 00:43:03,023
she means the world to me

1317
00:43:03,023 --> 00:43:04,391
and she's the love of my life

1318
00:43:04,391 --> 00:43:06,526
and I never get to tell her that enough.

1319
00:43:06,526 --> 00:43:07,928
And I hope that, you know,

1320
00:43:07,961 --> 00:43:09,563
She can see this on TV

1321
00:43:09,563 --> 00:43:11,331
- and celebrate with my sister.
- She will.

1322
00:43:11,331 --> 00:43:13,133
And just see how much

1323
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:14,468
love that she gave to me

1324
00:43:14,468 --> 00:43:15,369
that I'm able to give back

1325
00:43:15,369 --> 00:43:16,236
to the people around me

1326
00:43:16,236 --> 00:43:17,304
and my sisters.

1327
00:43:17,304 --> 00:43:19,306
- Same.
- Mother!

1328
00:43:19,306 --> 00:43:20,807
Finally, I'm at the top,

1329
00:43:20,807 --> 00:43:21,808
well, I mean,

1330
00:43:21,808 --> 00:43:23,176
it's a very strong top

1331
00:43:23,176 --> 00:43:24,911
and we are great at what we did

1332
00:43:24,911 --> 00:43:26,146
so I'm so proud of us.

1333
00:43:26,346 --> 00:43:27,614
Did you expect

1334
00:43:27,614 --> 00:43:29,082
- this?
- No.

1335
00:43:29,082 --> 00:43:31,518
We didn't expect to be in the bottom.

1336
00:43:31,985 --> 00:43:33,120
If it were my choice...

1337
00:43:33,754 --> 00:43:34,788
I feel like...

1338
00:43:34,788 --> 00:43:36,156
They would be my bottom too.

1339
00:43:37,090 --> 00:43:38,959
Yeah, but I think also at the same time

1340
00:43:38,959 --> 00:43:41,194
the girls had such good critiques

1341
00:43:41,228 --> 00:43:43,397
that it made, in comparison,

1342
00:43:43,430 --> 00:43:45,065
harder for them to choose.

1343
00:43:45,098 --> 00:43:46,466
So maybe it wasn't the fact

1344
00:43:46,466 --> 00:43:48,502
that you didn't understand your concept,

1345
00:43:48,535 --> 00:43:49,736
but just like comparatively,

1346
00:43:49,736 --> 00:43:51,338
they love the other stories better,

1347
00:43:51,338 --> 00:43:52,472
the storytelling.

1348
00:43:52,472 --> 00:43:54,541
Despite like whatever they decided,

1349
00:43:54,541 --> 00:43:56,376
- we still have to make a decision.
- Right.

1350
00:43:56,410 --> 00:43:57,711
And to be

1351
00:43:57,744 --> 00:43:59,379
choosing one of our sisters tonight,

1352
00:43:59,413 --> 00:44:00,180
you know what I mean?

1353
00:44:00,313 --> 00:44:03,316
So now I need to please someone again.

1354
00:44:03,316 --> 00:44:06,153
Or I need to negotiate again.

1355
00:44:06,653 --> 00:44:07,754
- Thank you.
- Excuse me.

1356
00:44:07,754 --> 00:44:09,456
We have to hear the girls.

1357
00:44:09,489 --> 00:44:10,157
Excuse me.

1358
00:44:10,457 --> 00:44:11,391
Wow.

1359
00:44:11,892 --> 00:44:12,926
Who is going to go home?

1360
00:44:12,959 --> 00:44:13,293
You know?

1361
00:44:13,293 --> 00:44:14,394
Because it is going to be hard

1362
00:44:14,394 --> 00:44:15,362
for the winner

1363
00:44:15,362 --> 00:44:16,396
to pick.

1364
00:44:16,430 --> 00:44:17,364
But,

1365
00:44:17,464 --> 00:44:18,865
I really want to know.

1366
00:44:20,333 --> 00:44:21,868
Oh, my God.

1367
00:44:22,169 --> 00:44:24,738
Two sisters from the same season?

1368
00:44:24,905 --> 00:44:26,573
One has to go home?

1369
00:44:26,973 --> 00:44:28,642
That must be hard!

1370
00:44:35,115 --> 00:44:37,284
I was emotional because

1371
00:44:37,317 --> 00:44:39,553
I remembered all the hard work

1372
00:44:39,586 --> 00:44:41,254
that we did for this.

1373
00:44:41,288 --> 00:44:44,191
And to see her in the bottom with me,

1374
00:44:44,324 --> 00:44:46,093
it's very emotional.

1375
00:44:47,127 --> 00:44:48,128
For me,

1376
00:44:49,529 --> 00:44:50,630
I just want you to know,

1377
00:44:50,630 --> 00:44:52,365
if you don't feel like

1378
00:44:52,399 --> 00:44:53,967
I'm here to fight,

1379
00:44:53,967 --> 00:44:55,669
I'm here to

1380
00:44:55,702 --> 00:44:58,805
win all the challenges.

1381
00:44:59,172 --> 00:45:01,308
- That is my goal.
- I see it.

1382
00:45:01,308 --> 00:45:02,909
You're very competitive.

1383
00:45:02,943 --> 00:45:05,445
And actually I am very scared that

1384
00:45:05,479 --> 00:45:07,013
when you win another challenge,

1385
00:45:07,013 --> 00:45:07,981
you have—

1386
00:45:07,981 --> 00:45:09,816
and you have opportunities to take me out,

1387
00:45:09,816 --> 00:45:11,184
you will take me out.

1388
00:45:12,953 --> 00:45:13,987
It depends. Kidding!

1389
00:45:15,322 --> 00:45:16,490
- Depends?
- I'm kidding!

1390
00:45:16,490 --> 00:45:18,058
Depends, okay.

1391
00:45:18,058 --> 00:45:19,526
- Okay. Oh, depends.
- No, I'm kidding!

1392
00:45:19,526 --> 00:45:20,327
If I will be strategic,

1393
00:45:20,327 --> 00:45:21,428
I will choose Arizona

1394
00:45:21,428 --> 00:45:22,429
to leave this competition

1395
00:45:22,429 --> 00:45:23,897
because I know

1396
00:45:23,897 --> 00:45:24,898
that she will do well in

1397
00:45:24,898 --> 00:45:26,066
the next coming weeks.

1398
00:45:26,633 --> 00:45:28,735
I just want you to know that

1399
00:45:28,769 --> 00:45:30,036
whatever the universe decides,

1400
00:45:30,036 --> 00:45:30,871
I'm fine with it.

1401
00:45:30,904 --> 00:45:33,206
But what I really want

1402
00:45:33,774 --> 00:45:36,510
is to get to the end.

1403
00:45:37,144 --> 00:45:38,678
As in, I really,

1404
00:45:38,845 --> 00:45:41,515
I really want this.

1405
00:45:41,548 --> 00:45:43,150
I really want to

1406
00:45:43,150 --> 00:45:44,284
make myself believe that

1407
00:45:44,284 --> 00:45:45,252
she's gonna save me.

1408
00:45:45,252 --> 00:45:46,853
However, I know that she

1409
00:45:46,853 --> 00:45:49,122
and Bernie have worked

1410
00:45:49,189 --> 00:45:51,158
for a long time, so

1411
00:45:51,191 --> 00:45:52,259
I don't know if she's

1412
00:45:52,259 --> 00:45:53,727
going to judge by that.

1413
00:45:54,094 --> 00:45:55,929
I want to see the world.

1414
00:45:56,062 --> 00:45:57,798
And—

1415
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,668
How can I say to you?

1416
00:46:03,103 --> 00:46:05,005
Because of the language barrier.

1417
00:46:05,906 --> 00:46:07,908
I was not able to express myself

1418
00:46:07,908 --> 00:46:10,277
but I know Suki understood me.

1419
00:46:10,710 --> 00:46:12,779
I want to show them

1420
00:46:12,779 --> 00:46:15,448
that being in the bottom isn't a hindrance...

1421
00:46:15,649 --> 00:46:17,818
I didn't understand.

1422
00:46:17,818 --> 00:46:20,887
That... you can overcome anything for your dreams.

1423
00:46:21,087 --> 00:46:22,489
- Dreams?
- Yeah.

1424
00:46:22,489 --> 00:46:23,490
You’re going to fight for it?

1425
00:46:23,523 --> 00:46:24,191
Yeah.

1426
00:46:25,725 --> 00:46:26,860
Oh sister,

1427
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:28,962
I didn't understand half of it, girl.

1428
00:46:29,029 --> 00:46:31,097
Even if I was not able to

1429
00:46:31,131 --> 00:46:33,233
speak in straight English,

1430
00:46:33,333 --> 00:46:35,268
I know she understood me.

1431
00:46:35,302 --> 00:46:36,736
She knows I wanted to stay,

1432
00:46:36,736 --> 00:46:38,438
I know she felt it.

1433
00:46:38,471 --> 00:46:39,973
So, Bernie,

1434
00:46:39,973 --> 00:46:41,474
why you,

1435
00:46:41,508 --> 00:46:42,642
and not Arizona?

1436
00:46:42,642 --> 00:46:44,377
You've been in the bottom twice.

1437
00:46:44,411 --> 00:46:46,012
And this is the second time

1438
00:46:46,046 --> 00:46:47,647
that...

1439
00:46:47,881 --> 00:46:48,915
You're in the same position

1440
00:46:48,915 --> 00:46:50,217
and I am in the same position.

1441
00:46:50,217 --> 00:46:51,952
- Yes.
- I gave you the chance last time.

1442
00:46:51,985 --> 00:46:54,855
They both still have stories they want to keep telling

1443
00:46:54,855 --> 00:46:57,657
and things they want to prove here on our show.

1444
00:46:57,724 --> 00:46:58,925
But,

1445
00:46:58,959 --> 00:47:01,161
I don't see any fire with Bernie.

1446
00:47:01,161 --> 00:47:03,330
I don't know, and I don't understand.

1447
00:47:06,099 --> 00:47:08,001
I told you, I was going to step up.

1448
00:47:08,001 --> 00:47:10,237
Sis, I did the work, I did everything right, today.

1449
00:47:10,237 --> 00:47:12,239
I know I did.

1450
00:47:13,373 --> 00:47:16,476
I guess I just feel like they don't want me here.

1451
00:47:17,911 --> 00:47:20,113
Who doesn't want you here?

1452
00:47:20,113 --> 00:47:21,147
Who?

1453
00:47:21,147 --> 00:47:22,349
They don't want me here.

1454
00:47:22,349 --> 00:47:23,016
Who do you mean, they?

1455
00:47:23,049 --> 00:47:25,285
Them! Who are they?

1456
00:47:25,585 --> 00:47:28,021
- The judges?
- I think.

1457
00:47:28,021 --> 00:47:29,489
I don't think so, Bernie.

1458
00:47:30,023 --> 00:47:31,725
You've been a fierce

1459
00:47:31,858 --> 00:47:32,659
competitor.

1460
00:47:32,659 --> 00:47:34,060
You've been a fierce drag queen.

1461
00:47:34,094 --> 00:47:35,562
I love you.

1462
00:47:35,695 --> 00:47:37,564
You know that, I love you, sis.

1463
00:47:38,698 --> 00:47:40,467
I have a feeling that they're going to pick me.

1464
00:47:40,467 --> 00:47:42,469
Because of the track record.

1465
00:47:42,469 --> 00:47:43,770
They're basing it off of the track record.

1466
00:47:43,770 --> 00:47:45,672
And I have the worst track record.

1467
00:47:46,172 --> 00:47:47,574
Because I was safe, safe, safe,

1468
00:47:47,574 --> 00:47:48,575
bottom, bottom.

1469
00:47:49,242 --> 00:47:51,011
I have the lowest score.

1470
00:47:51,444 --> 00:47:52,712
How are you, sister?

1471
00:47:52,979 --> 00:47:53,847
I'm good.

1472
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:54,948
It just hurts to

1473
00:47:54,948 --> 00:47:56,149
be with my sister.

1474
00:47:56,149 --> 00:47:57,150
Like she's your

1475
00:47:57,150 --> 00:47:58,051
best friend.

1476
00:47:58,118 --> 00:47:58,852
She is.

1477
00:47:59,819 --> 00:48:01,488
But I want to stay

1478
00:48:01,521 --> 00:48:02,722
so bad.

1479
00:48:02,756 --> 00:48:04,925
The feeling, while pleading, I was like

1480
00:48:04,925 --> 00:48:06,927
being beaten all over.

1481
00:48:06,927 --> 00:48:07,627
I was being

1482
00:48:07,661 --> 00:48:08,628
pushed around.

1483
00:48:08,628 --> 00:48:09,663
That's how it feels.

1484
00:48:09,729 --> 00:48:10,897
I'm really struggling.

1485
00:48:10,897 --> 00:48:11,831
If there's one thing I

1486
00:48:11,831 --> 00:48:13,533
can say, but obviously

1487
00:48:13,667 --> 00:48:14,834
because it—compared to

1488
00:48:14,834 --> 00:48:16,336
the other like, group,

1489
00:48:16,436 --> 00:48:18,071
yours were more simple.

1490
00:48:18,138 --> 00:48:18,838
- Yeah.
- You made—

1491
00:48:18,838 --> 00:48:21,274
- it is a stretch dress.
- Okay.

1492
00:48:21,274 --> 00:48:22,309
I'm not going to take that away,

1493
00:48:22,309 --> 00:48:23,310
it is a stretch dress,

1494
00:48:23,343 --> 00:48:24,177
and I think that's

1495
00:48:24,177 --> 00:48:25,345
where you could have,

1496
00:48:25,378 --> 00:48:26,746
you know, added more

1497
00:48:26,746 --> 00:48:28,181
to it or make it better

1498
00:48:28,214 --> 00:48:30,016
to not fall into that.

1499
00:48:30,283 --> 00:48:31,584
I may have been in the bottom,

1500
00:48:31,618 --> 00:48:33,320
twice now, but I think,

1501
00:48:33,353 --> 00:48:34,287
think I've shown where

1502
00:48:34,287 --> 00:48:35,789
my strengths are

1503
00:48:35,822 --> 00:48:38,158
and I know what my weaknesses are

1504
00:48:38,158 --> 00:48:39,125
and I'm going to work

1505
00:48:39,125 --> 00:48:40,527
on those weaknesses.

1506
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:41,695
Thank you for pointing

1507
00:48:41,695 --> 00:48:44,064
that out because,

1508
00:48:44,531 --> 00:48:46,366
I didn't have any doubts today,

1509
00:48:46,399 --> 00:48:49,035
but thank you for being honest that

1510
00:48:49,202 --> 00:48:50,070
this was, this was

1511
00:48:50,070 --> 00:48:51,938
a stretch fabric, I know.

1512
00:48:51,972 --> 00:48:53,173
Girl, like

1513
00:48:53,173 --> 00:48:54,975
that was also my weakest point

1514
00:48:54,975 --> 00:48:55,842
on my season.

1515
00:48:55,909 --> 00:48:56,876
But that's what I mean.

1516
00:48:56,876 --> 00:48:58,078
- It shouldn't be again.
- Yeah.

1517
00:48:58,211 --> 00:49:00,213
Know what I mean? And I know you can do it.

1518
00:49:00,246 --> 00:49:02,449
It's not a win-win situation.

1519
00:49:02,449 --> 00:49:03,850
If I stay,

1520
00:49:03,883 --> 00:49:05,418
Bernie's going to leave.

1521
00:49:05,452 --> 00:49:08,488
And if Bernie stays, I don't—

1522
00:49:08,521 --> 00:49:09,689
I'm not going to be

1523
00:49:09,689 --> 00:49:10,757
on the finale.

1524
00:49:10,757 --> 00:49:12,258
It's the end of my journey.

1525
00:49:12,726 --> 00:49:14,561
But if ever

1526
00:49:14,594 --> 00:49:16,396
Bernie stays,

1527
00:49:16,396 --> 00:49:17,430
I'm gonna be

1528
00:49:17,464 --> 00:49:18,865
really happy for her.

1529
00:49:18,898 --> 00:49:20,400
And I'm gonna be rooting

1530
00:49:20,433 --> 00:49:22,002
for her all the way.

1531
00:49:23,937 --> 00:49:25,505
At least you're still pretty when you cry.

1532
00:49:25,538 --> 00:49:27,140
Right?

1533
00:49:27,474 --> 00:49:28,808
That's a talent itself.

1534
00:49:33,079 --> 00:49:34,381
It's so hard to be

1535
00:49:34,381 --> 00:49:36,383
choosing a lipstick from

1536
00:49:36,383 --> 00:49:38,451
both Filipino queens.

1537
00:49:38,551 --> 00:49:40,320
I love these queens

1538
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:43,056
so much, and,

1539
00:49:43,056 --> 00:49:46,126
it feels sad to be

1540
00:49:46,159 --> 00:49:48,495
sending someone home.

1541
00:49:52,499 --> 00:49:53,700
I can't believe I have

1542
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:54,601
to choose one of my

1543
00:49:54,601 --> 00:49:56,102
sister's lipstick because

1544
00:49:56,136 --> 00:49:57,604
she's so close to me and

1545
00:49:57,604 --> 00:49:59,639
we have bonded so much.

1546
00:50:03,743 --> 00:50:05,378
Alright, we're playing this game.

1547
00:50:05,378 --> 00:50:07,147
It's called Sungka.

1548
00:50:07,247 --> 00:50:07,947
It's called who?

1549
00:50:07,981 --> 00:50:08,948
Sungka.

1550
00:50:08,982 --> 00:50:09,816
Sungka.

1551
00:50:09,849 --> 00:50:10,817
Yes.

1552
00:50:10,917 --> 00:50:12,318
So you go like this,

1553
00:50:12,352 --> 00:50:13,887
get the seashells.

1554
00:50:13,953 --> 00:50:14,487
Yes.

1555
00:50:14,521 --> 00:50:15,522
And then, like,

1556
00:50:15,555 --> 00:50:16,056
this, right,

1557
00:50:16,056 --> 00:50:16,756
Katkat?

1558
00:50:16,790 --> 00:50:17,323
Yes.

1559
00:50:17,323 --> 00:50:18,792
Come on, you can do it!

1560
00:50:18,792 --> 00:50:19,759
- Come on!
- Go, cheer!

1561
00:50:19,926 --> 00:50:21,294
Is it a race or something?

1562
00:50:21,294 --> 00:50:21,661
Yes.

1563
00:50:21,661 --> 00:50:23,329
- Is it a race?
- Yes, go!

1564
00:50:23,396 --> 00:50:24,297
Go!

1565
00:50:24,297 --> 00:50:25,865
- Yeah, that's it.
- Yes!

1566
00:50:25,865 --> 00:50:27,400
And that!

1567
00:50:27,434 --> 00:50:30,070
Oh, my gosh, that was ferocious for real!

1568
00:50:30,070 --> 00:50:31,938
And you're right, that was a ferocious and

1569
00:50:31,971 --> 00:50:33,673
cataclysmic game.

1570
00:50:33,673 --> 00:50:35,742
Cataclysmic?!

1571
00:50:35,742 --> 00:50:39,913
Now bring back my hardworking girls.

1572
00:50:39,946 --> 00:50:42,582
Welcome back, ladies.

1573
00:50:42,615 --> 00:50:44,084
Two Top Slaysians

1574
00:50:44,084 --> 00:50:45,652
stand before me.

1575
00:50:46,519 --> 00:50:47,720
Prior to tonight,

1576
00:50:47,754 --> 00:50:49,189
you were asked to prepare

1577
00:50:49,189 --> 00:50:50,857
a lip sync performance of

1578
00:50:50,890 --> 00:50:53,193
“Room” by Stell.

1579
00:50:53,326 --> 00:50:55,628
Queens, this is your chance to impress me

1580
00:50:55,662 --> 00:50:57,931
and win 80,000 pesos,

1581
00:50:57,964 --> 00:51:01,534
and earn the power to give one of the Bottom queens, the

1582
00:51:01,568 --> 00:51:02,902
karate chop!

1583
00:51:02,902 --> 00:51:04,904
Hi-ya!

1584
00:51:06,806 --> 00:51:08,308
Excuse me.

1585
00:51:08,641 --> 00:51:11,277
The time has come

1586
00:51:12,212 --> 00:51:14,080
for you to lip sync

1587
00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:17,917
for your legacy!

1588
00:51:20,587 --> 00:51:21,721
So, me and Brigiding

1589
00:51:21,721 --> 00:51:23,123
we are about to lipsync

1590
00:51:23,123 --> 00:51:24,524
and I’m so excited to, because

1591
00:51:24,524 --> 00:51:26,493
I’m an entertainer and I want to perform.

1592
00:51:26,759 --> 00:51:28,728
so it’s very exciting for me.

1593
00:51:29,996 --> 00:51:30,964
Good luck, Queens.

1594
00:51:30,964 --> 00:51:32,966
And don't fuck it up.

1595
00:51:33,766 --> 00:51:36,769
Suki Doll, I love you so much, but

1596
00:51:36,803 --> 00:51:38,338
if this was a Lip Sync For Your Life,

1597
00:51:38,371 --> 00:51:40,640
you'd be sashaying away.

1598
00:51:45,278 --> 00:51:46,713
Go motherfucker!

1599
00:51:57,090 --> 00:52:00,026
As soon as I set foot and try

1600
00:52:00,026 --> 00:52:01,661
To make myself alive

1601
00:52:01,661 --> 00:52:04,297
I see your eyes they glued in mine,

1602
00:52:04,297 --> 00:52:06,566
happens all the time

1603
00:52:06,599 --> 00:52:09,903
And then you'll tell me, "I can't get you off of my mind"

1604
00:52:09,903 --> 00:52:12,739
My, oh my

1605
00:52:12,739 --> 00:52:15,241
Come and get inside, let's talk about it in my room

1606
00:52:15,275 --> 00:52:17,477
Babe,

1607
00:52:17,477 --> 00:52:19,412
hope you're ready 'cause I'm gon' invade

1608
00:52:19,412 --> 00:52:22,148
- hope you're ready 'cause I'm gon' invade
- Come on girls!

1609
00:52:22,182 --> 00:52:25,251
Listen to what I'm about to say (oh)

1610
00:52:25,251 --> 00:52:26,786
- Listen to what I'm about to say (oh)
- Oh, my God!

1611
00:52:26,786 --> 00:52:28,955
You will find the answer

1612
00:52:28,955 --> 00:52:33,693
This energy that's within me might be too much to take

1613
00:52:33,693 --> 00:52:38,264
Damn, it is so pretty, I see me flow in your body

1614
00:52:38,264 --> 00:52:42,835
Picture-perfect movie, trembling thrills me, I don't want an ending

1615
00:52:42,835 --> 00:52:47,507
Savor every bit of it, 'cause we're not in a hurry

1616
00:52:47,507 --> 00:52:53,046
I hate to break it to you, but in this room, there's no one leaving

1617
00:52:53,613 --> 00:53:02,021
Ah, ah, can you read the room?

1618
00:53:02,021 --> 00:53:04,857
Ah, ah (aw)

1619
00:53:05,959 --> 00:53:12,332
I hate to break it to you, but in this room, there's no one leaving

1620
00:53:12,398 --> 00:53:12,999
Dance

1621
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:22,141
Hit it (aw)

1622
00:53:31,117 --> 00:53:32,218
Go

1623
00:53:35,455 --> 00:53:36,889
Werk it girl, werk it!

1624
00:53:39,459 --> 00:53:40,226
Yas!

1625
00:53:43,529 --> 00:53:45,565
Baby, don't you worry,

1626
00:53:45,565 --> 00:53:46,432
- as long as you're here with me

1627
00:53:46,432 --> 00:53:48,067
- as long as you're here with me
- Kiss!

1628
00:53:48,067 --> 00:53:50,003
- You won't take no hurt, 'cause I will be your sanctuary
- Kiss!

1629
00:53:50,003 --> 00:53:52,438
You won't take no hurt, 'cause I will be your sanctuary

1630
00:53:52,438 --> 00:53:53,373
Oh, my God!

1631
00:53:53,373 --> 00:53:56,776
If you only let me orchestrate this story

1632
00:53:56,776 --> 00:53:58,711
We won't have to leave this room,

1633
00:53:58,711 --> 00:54:01,481
'cause I'm your everything (aw)

1634
00:54:06,019 --> 00:54:07,320
Oh, my God!

1635
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:09,889
They’re serving sex, slut, and cunt.

1636
00:54:11,424 --> 00:54:13,226
Oh, my God!

1637
00:54:13,559 --> 00:54:16,162
Ah, ah, mm

1638
00:54:16,162 --> 00:54:17,864
Read the room

1639
00:54:18,431 --> 00:54:21,668
Can you, can you? (Aw, ha-ha)

1640
00:54:21,734 --> 00:54:23,503
I hate to break it to you,

1641
00:54:23,503 --> 00:54:27,373
but in this room, there's no one leaving

1642
00:54:27,373 --> 00:54:33,112
- Werk!
- Yas!!!

1643
00:54:33,713 --> 00:54:34,547
Disgusting.

1644
00:54:34,814 --> 00:54:37,383
- Oh my, I love it!
- Oh, my God!

1645
00:54:37,650 --> 00:54:38,818
Queens.

1646
00:54:38,918 --> 00:54:40,920
I have made my decision.

1647
00:54:46,359 --> 00:54:47,660
Brigiding.

1648
00:54:50,797 --> 00:54:51,931
You are a slayer, baby.

1649
00:54:51,931 --> 00:54:53,032
Condragulations!

1650
00:54:53,032 --> 00:54:53,933
- Yes!
- Yas!

1651
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:57,170
You've earned a cash tip of 80,000 pesos.

1652
00:54:57,170 --> 00:54:58,671
And you also get a RuBadge.

1653
00:54:58,705 --> 00:55:00,139
Give her a RuBadge!

1654
00:55:00,139 --> 00:55:01,808
Thank you!

1655
00:55:01,841 --> 00:55:03,976
Wear it with Slaysian pride.

1656
00:55:04,110 --> 00:55:04,711
What?!

1657
00:55:05,178 --> 00:55:07,046
It's such a great feeling to finally,

1658
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:09,148
get my first RuBadge.

1659
00:55:09,215 --> 00:55:10,717
Suki Doll,

1660
00:55:11,050 --> 00:55:11,651
you're safe.

1661
00:55:11,651 --> 00:55:13,686
You may join the other queens.

1662
00:55:17,256 --> 00:55:20,426
Now, will the Bottom queens please step forward.

1663
00:55:31,304 --> 00:55:32,238
Brigiding.

1664
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:36,776
With great power from our Slaysian ancestors,

1665
00:55:36,776 --> 00:55:38,911
comes great responsibility.

1666
00:55:38,911 --> 00:55:40,079
Which Queen

1667
00:55:40,179 --> 00:55:41,180
have you chosen

1668
00:55:41,180 --> 00:55:42,949
to get the Karate Chop?

1669
00:55:44,350 --> 00:55:45,952
Oh, my goodness.

1670
00:55:45,952 --> 00:55:47,787
This is it!

1671
00:55:48,087 --> 00:55:50,456
One Filipina Queen is gonna go home,

1672
00:55:50,556 --> 00:55:51,391
tonight.

1673
00:55:52,358 --> 00:55:53,393
International Queens,

1674
00:55:53,393 --> 00:55:55,128
make some noise! Kidding!

1675
00:55:56,429 --> 00:55:59,031
The queen that I've chosen is someone

1676
00:55:59,065 --> 00:56:00,199
that is

1677
00:56:00,233 --> 00:56:02,802
a real force in the drag industry,

1678
00:56:02,802 --> 00:56:06,439
especially after Drag Race Philippines.

1679
00:56:07,807 --> 00:56:09,776
She has grown so much

1680
00:56:09,809 --> 00:56:12,412
before coming in Drag Race Season 2,

1681
00:56:12,445 --> 00:56:14,313
to after Season 2,

1682
00:56:14,313 --> 00:56:15,615
to here.

1683
00:56:16,649 --> 00:56:20,119
So the queen that I've chosen is...

1684
00:56:21,187 --> 00:56:23,322
You will always be a star, Sis.

1685
00:56:24,891 --> 00:56:26,225
Bernie.

1686
00:56:31,864 --> 00:56:33,266
Bernie.

1687
00:56:33,266 --> 00:56:34,901
As it is written,

1688
00:56:34,901 --> 00:56:37,670
so it shall be done.

1689
00:56:40,106 --> 00:56:42,608
The Philippines' Powerhouse Diday.

1690
00:56:42,675 --> 00:56:45,445
You will always be a Slaysian Sensation.

1691
00:56:47,613 --> 00:56:49,682
Now, sashay away.

1692
00:56:51,250 --> 00:56:52,919
Thank you so much for the opportunity,

1693
00:56:52,952 --> 00:56:54,387
Drag Race Philippines.

1694
00:56:54,420 --> 00:56:55,721
Thank you so much.

1695
00:56:55,755 --> 00:56:56,456
Thank you, thank you.

1696
00:56:56,456 --> 00:56:58,391
I love you, Bernie.

1697
00:57:00,326 --> 00:57:03,062
Bernie, love you, Bernie.

1698
00:57:05,064 --> 00:57:07,500
You're a fucking fierce ass queen.

1699
00:57:10,636 --> 00:57:13,105
Goodbye, my Didays!

1700
00:57:15,675 --> 00:57:18,144
You can do it. I know I did.

1701
00:57:18,177 --> 00:57:19,479
Bye bye!

1702
00:57:20,580 --> 00:57:23,483
Bye, Bernie!

1703
00:57:25,284 --> 00:57:27,086
Oh, my God.

1704
00:57:27,086 --> 00:57:30,356
So, this is how it feels to be eliminated.

1705
00:57:31,390 --> 00:57:33,159
I feel bad

1706
00:57:33,192 --> 00:57:35,261
because I feel like

1707
00:57:35,261 --> 00:57:37,263
I've made a lot of mistakes in life.

1708
00:57:38,164 --> 00:57:40,132
I guess what's next for Diday is

1709
00:57:40,132 --> 00:57:43,135
to prove that I shouldn't have been eliminated.

1710
00:57:46,305 --> 00:57:48,140
I'm still Bernie.

1711
00:57:48,841 --> 00:57:50,710
I'm still your one, and only Diday.

1712
00:57:50,710 --> 00:57:52,178
Remember that.

1713
00:57:52,645 --> 00:57:56,115
I may not have won the Slaysian Royale,

1714
00:57:56,749 --> 00:57:57,917
but, for now,

1715
00:57:58,351 --> 00:58:00,920
I'll see you soon.

1716
00:58:00,953 --> 00:58:03,623
Thank you, everyone. Thank you.

1717
00:58:07,460 --> 00:58:09,228
Condragulations, Queens!

1718
00:58:09,228 --> 00:58:11,264
You all made your mothers proud!

1719
00:58:11,264 --> 00:58:12,431
So here I say,

1720
00:58:12,431 --> 00:58:13,432
Your mothers are all queens!

1721
00:58:13,633 --> 00:58:16,035
Your mother is a queen, too!

1722
00:58:16,035 --> 00:58:17,136
Your mother is a queen!

1723
00:58:17,203 --> 00:58:18,070
Do it again, slowly.

1724
00:58:18,070 --> 00:58:19,405
Your mother is a queen!

1725
00:58:19,605 --> 00:58:21,073
Your mother is a queen!

1726
00:58:21,073 --> 00:58:23,376
Your mother is a queen, too!

1727
00:58:23,709 --> 00:58:25,278
And remember,

1728
00:58:25,311 --> 00:58:26,779
always be true to yourself

1729
00:58:26,779 --> 00:58:27,914
in your thoughts,

1730
00:58:27,947 --> 00:58:28,781
in your words

1731
00:58:28,781 --> 00:58:29,916
and in all that you do,

1732
00:58:29,916 --> 00:58:31,817
All heart. Always and in all ways.

1733
00:58:31,817 --> 00:58:33,286
We love you, Jiggly.

1734
00:58:33,286 --> 00:58:35,555
Can I get an eme up in here?

1735
00:58:35,621 --> 00:58:38,024
Eme!

1736
00:58:38,324 --> 00:58:40,393
Now let the music play, let's party!

1737
00:58:55,041 --> 00:58:57,643
Next on Drag Race Philippines: Slaysian Royale.

1738
00:58:57,977 --> 00:59:00,046
It's time to take things to the next level.

1739
00:59:00,046 --> 00:59:02,114
Because for this week's Maxi Challenge,

1740
00:59:02,114 --> 00:59:03,182
we will be doing

1741
00:59:03,182 --> 00:59:06,385
the Snatch...

1742
00:59:06,652 --> 00:59:08,454
Elections!

1743
00:59:08,454 --> 00:59:10,456
I am just going to, you know...

1744
00:59:12,425 --> 00:59:13,826
Actually, I don't have a plan.

1745
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:15,861
I've been enjoying

1746
00:59:15,861 --> 00:59:18,364
but it seems like I'm not good enough.

1747
00:59:18,364 --> 00:59:20,733
It kind of felt flat for me.

1748
00:59:20,833 --> 00:59:22,602
This is mystical,

1749
00:59:22,602 --> 00:59:25,571
fantastical at its finest.

1750
00:59:25,571 --> 00:59:26,572
Are you ready for me?

1751
00:59:26,639 --> 00:59:28,374
Is this what you wanted to see from me?

1752
00:59:28,507 --> 00:59:29,875
Is what just happened for real?
