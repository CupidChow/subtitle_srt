00:00:01,244 --> 00:00:03,946
Previously on Drag Race Philippines: Slaysian Royale.

2
00:00:03,946 --> 00:00:05,882
Queens, for this week's Maxi Challenge,

3
00:00:05,882 --> 00:00:08,684
we're making herstory with the first-ever,

4
00:00:08,684 --> 00:00:10,253
DragCon Slaysia

5
00:00:10,386 --> 00:00:13,289
Each one of you must present and showcase your brand

6
00:00:13,289 --> 00:00:16,726
and personality at your DIY DragCon booth.

7
00:00:16,726 --> 00:00:17,994
Suki Doll.

8
00:00:18,094 --> 00:00:19,595
I felt

9
00:00:19,629 --> 00:00:21,464
completely engaged the whole time.

10
00:00:21,464 --> 00:00:23,299
Impeccable branding.

11
00:00:23,366 --> 00:00:24,700
You're a star, Brigiding.

12
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:25,201
Yes!

13
00:00:25,201 --> 00:00:26,936
Because you are that girl.

14
00:00:26,936 --> 00:00:28,905
Viñas DeLuxe.

15
00:00:29,005 --> 00:00:30,606
I felt that you were more controlling

16
00:00:30,606 --> 00:00:32,675
and was a little aggressive to a fan.

17
00:00:32,675 --> 00:00:34,110
I wouldn't feel like

18
00:00:34,143 --> 00:00:34,944
I would want to go back

19
00:00:34,944 --> 00:00:36,179
and I know that's not you.

20
00:00:36,379 --> 00:00:37,346
There's a lot of things

21
00:00:37,346 --> 00:00:38,881
that's happening in my mind.

22
00:00:38,948 --> 00:00:41,050
And I'm so pressured.

23
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:42,618
Arizona Brandy.

24
00:00:42,618 --> 00:00:44,520
Out of all these girls,

25
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,389
you were the one I enjoyed the most

26
00:00:46,389 --> 00:00:48,524
because you really let me know you.

27
00:00:48,524 --> 00:00:49,625
Khianna.

28
00:00:49,692 --> 00:00:51,494
You did have a lot of great things,

29
00:00:51,561 --> 00:00:54,330
but you were not the Khianna that we know.

30
00:00:54,564 --> 00:00:55,898
Arizona Brandy,

31
00:00:55,898 --> 00:00:57,066
Condragulations!

32
00:00:57,066 --> 00:00:58,000
- You are the winner of this week's challenge.
- Oh, my God!

33
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,235
You are the winner of this week's challenge.

34
00:00:59,235 --> 00:00:59,969
Oh, my God!

35
00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:01,604
Suki Doll.

36
00:01:01,604 --> 00:01:03,306
Condragulations!

37
00:01:03,306 --> 00:01:04,707
You are also the winner of

38
00:01:04,707 --> 00:01:06,209
this week's challenge.

39
00:01:06,242 --> 00:01:07,710
Viñas DeLuxe.

40
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:08,344
Khianna.

41
00:01:08,344 --> 00:01:10,446
You two are the Bottom queens of the week.

42
00:01:10,613 --> 00:01:12,181
The time has come

43
00:01:12,181 --> 00:01:13,783
for you to Lip Sync

44
00:01:13,783 --> 00:01:15,985
for your Life!

45
00:01:16,052 --> 00:01:18,921
You will always be a Slaysian Sensation.

46
00:01:19,055 --> 00:01:21,090
Khianna, sashay away.

47
00:01:25,928 --> 00:01:27,430
Oh, my God.

48
00:01:29,565 --> 00:01:30,199
Twinning!

49
00:01:30,199 --> 00:01:32,368
- Twinning, fashion girlies.
- Yeah!

50
00:01:32,368 --> 00:01:34,770
The fashion girlies are walking.

51
00:01:34,871 --> 00:01:35,905
Aww.

52
00:01:36,172 --> 00:01:40,910
It did not sink in to me that Khianna was eliminated.

53
00:01:41,144 --> 00:01:43,746
"I'm sorry, thank you for believing."

54
00:01:43,779 --> 00:01:46,382
K for “this kannot be the end."

55
00:01:46,415 --> 00:01:47,884
"Ikonic."

56
00:01:49,452 --> 00:01:51,154
Khianna!

57
00:01:51,154 --> 00:01:53,256
We love you, Khianna!

58
00:01:53,289 --> 00:01:56,492
Her run in this season is interesting.

59
00:01:56,526 --> 00:01:59,428
And I know Khianna has more to offer.

60
00:01:59,462 --> 00:02:02,598
Unfortunately, it was her time to leave.

61
00:02:02,598 --> 00:02:04,300
I really deserved to be in the bottom

62
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,735
and I felt that.

63
00:02:05,735 --> 00:02:08,171
It's hard to lip sync against Khianna,

64
00:02:08,171 --> 00:02:09,539
one of the best lip syncers.

65
00:02:09,572 --> 00:02:13,109
Khianna, I'm sorry that I had to be the reason you left, but

66
00:02:13,142 --> 00:02:15,011
I'm so happy to be here.

67
00:02:15,011 --> 00:02:16,846
Track record-wise,

68
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:19,282
Khianna's out, sister's in.

69
00:02:19,282 --> 00:02:22,218
She has two RuBadges so she deserves to stay.

70
00:02:22,251 --> 00:02:23,920
We love you, Khianna!

71
00:02:25,221 --> 00:02:27,823
And congratulations, Ari and Suki!

72
00:02:29,025 --> 00:02:31,494
- For winning your RuBadges this week!
- Fashion girl!

73
00:02:32,228 --> 00:02:33,729
I really want to be on the finale.

74
00:02:33,729 --> 00:02:36,265
I've been saying that a lot of times here.

75
00:02:36,265 --> 00:02:37,667
I'm gonna do my best to be there.

76
00:02:37,667 --> 00:02:38,801
How do you feel, Suki?

77
00:02:38,801 --> 00:02:40,937
This is the win that you've been wanting.

78
00:02:41,037 --> 00:02:43,573
I finally feel that I've worked my worth

79
00:02:43,573 --> 00:02:45,808
and also proven to everyone

80
00:02:45,841 --> 00:02:47,743
that I deserve my top place

81
00:02:47,777 --> 00:02:50,713
with the badge and these challenges I've been nailing.

82
00:02:50,713 --> 00:02:52,248
Like, we are so far in the competition,

83
00:02:52,248 --> 00:02:53,649
I felt undeserving.

84
00:02:53,683 --> 00:02:55,117
Even if I always say that

85
00:02:55,117 --> 00:02:56,652
I don't need the validation outside,

86
00:02:56,652 --> 00:02:58,854
obviously you do feel at some point

87
00:02:58,854 --> 00:03:01,023
that you want to be seen and I think

88
00:03:01,023 --> 00:03:03,159
this is what I needed just to push

89
00:03:03,192 --> 00:03:04,660
even further and I think

90
00:03:05,895 --> 00:03:07,964
everyone is just so amazing and I want to be

91
00:03:07,964 --> 00:03:09,932
showing the same level of like,

92
00:03:09,932 --> 00:03:12,335
spirit and energy that everyone is.

93
00:03:12,335 --> 00:03:14,770
That was the first time I saw her cry and I was like,

94
00:03:15,538 --> 00:03:17,273
aww, she's still human.

95
00:03:17,573 --> 00:03:20,042
This is not the Top 4 I expected

96
00:03:20,076 --> 00:03:21,410
from the beginning, but, like,

97
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:23,112
- Who are your Top 4?
- Who is it?

98
00:03:23,112 --> 00:03:25,047
- Hold on, bitch, that's not the point.
- No, no, say it.

99
00:03:25,047 --> 00:03:27,416
- Well, I'm just saying-
- That's not the point!

100
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:30,453
Going throughout the challenges, like, you two

101
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:32,021
are fierce competition.

102
00:03:32,021 --> 00:03:32,822
Yeah, hundred percent.

103
00:03:32,822 --> 00:03:36,325
Girl, you've proven it to us that you can stay on the top

104
00:03:36,325 --> 00:03:37,426
consistently.

105
00:03:37,426 --> 00:03:38,995
And you deserve this spot.

106
00:03:39,095 --> 00:03:40,863
I didn't envision a Top 4.

107
00:03:42,932 --> 00:03:45,735
I just thought as long as Brigiding and I are the Top 2, I'll be happy.

108
00:03:45,768 --> 00:03:47,136
As long as it is one of us, I'm okay.

109
00:03:47,169 --> 00:03:49,538
I didn't even see myself in the Top 4.

110
00:03:49,538 --> 00:03:52,241
But as the weeks progressed, this

111
00:03:52,275 --> 00:03:56,078
is the fucking Brigiding deserving of the Top 4,

112
00:03:56,078 --> 00:03:58,714
to be in the finale, to be getting that crown.

113
00:03:59,248 --> 00:04:00,616
Okay!

114
00:04:00,616 --> 00:04:04,920
- And because of that let's de-drag, darling.
- Okay! Let's de-drag!

115
00:04:04,954 --> 00:04:06,856
I'm the only one and there's three of them.

116
00:04:06,856 --> 00:04:08,291
Are they going to gang up on me?

117
00:04:09,425 --> 00:04:10,426
I just feel hot.

118
00:04:10,426 --> 00:04:12,795
Can I try it, sis? Come on, do it to me.

119
00:04:12,795 --> 00:04:15,731
It feels so rewarding to finally be here,

120
00:04:15,731 --> 00:04:18,067
be the final four, the Top 4.

121
00:04:18,067 --> 00:04:18,868
And I'm excited.

122
00:04:18,868 --> 00:04:20,736
Just throw me any challenges, you know?

123
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:24,373
How about, okay, okay how about this?

124
00:04:24,373 --> 00:04:26,409
If these girls are going to try to bite mother,

125
00:04:26,442 --> 00:04:27,543
she will bite back.

126
00:04:29,845 --> 00:04:30,946
Kidding!

127
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:41,057
The winner of Drag Race Philippines: Slaysian Royale

128
00:04:41,057 --> 00:04:42,358
will receive a one-year supply of

129
00:04:42,358 --> 00:04:44,160
Anastasia Beverly Hills Cosmetics.

130
00:04:44,193 --> 00:04:47,630
A coveted spot on the Drag Race Slaysian Hall of Fame.

131
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:48,898
And a cash prize of

132
00:04:48,898 --> 00:04:50,466
2 Million Pesos!

133
00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:51,967
Powered by Bingo Plus.

134
00:04:51,967 --> 00:04:54,403
Tonight with our extra special guest judges,

135
00:04:54,403 --> 00:04:55,938
Marina Summers and

136
00:04:55,938 --> 00:04:57,239
Nymphia Wind!

137
00:05:09,018 --> 00:05:10,686
Top 4!

138
00:05:10,686 --> 00:05:11,887
Oh, my God!

139
00:05:11,887 --> 00:05:13,489
Good morning!

140
00:05:13,489 --> 00:05:15,224
Now, there's just four of us.

141
00:05:15,224 --> 00:05:16,992
I don't know how many is going to stay,

142
00:05:16,992 --> 00:05:19,862
but I'm making sure that I am in the last

143
00:05:19,895 --> 00:05:21,797
Top 4, 3, 2, or 1.

144
00:05:21,797 --> 00:05:24,834
- It's Top 4!
- Yeah!

145
00:05:24,834 --> 00:05:25,901
I'm really happy.

146
00:05:25,901 --> 00:05:27,636
It's the gravity in the popcorn.

147
00:05:27,636 --> 00:05:28,537
- Right!
- Yes!

148
00:05:28,571 --> 00:05:30,773
Do you have that one person who you think

149
00:05:30,806 --> 00:05:32,141
is the competition?

150
00:05:32,174 --> 00:05:34,043
Well, I follow a score sheet.

151
00:05:34,043 --> 00:05:35,778
And the one that's on the top right now

152
00:05:35,811 --> 00:05:37,480
- is Brigiding, no?
- Okay.

153
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,148
Ding ding ding ding ding ding!

154
00:05:39,181 --> 00:05:41,350
I'm happy and very excited

155
00:05:41,384 --> 00:05:45,020
because I am two weeks away from the crown.

156
00:05:45,054 --> 00:05:47,957
My biggest threat in this competition is my sister.

157
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:52,128
She knows her drag, and the way to do it best.

158
00:05:52,161 --> 00:05:55,064
I didn't make it to the Top 4 before, and now,

159
00:05:55,064 --> 00:05:56,565
it feels right.

160
00:05:56,565 --> 00:05:59,435
And I've proven to myself, that—oh, my God,

161
00:05:59,435 --> 00:06:02,037
I can do it. I really can do it.

162
00:06:02,238 --> 00:06:03,806
Can I be honest?

163
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:05,808
I also didn't see you in this finale.

164
00:06:07,176 --> 00:06:08,344
Wow!

165
00:06:09,812 --> 00:06:11,781
But seeing your growth and how you've

166
00:06:11,781 --> 00:06:14,984
prepared yourself and how you want to change the narrative

167
00:06:14,984 --> 00:06:16,552
of how people perceive you,

168
00:06:16,585 --> 00:06:18,888
I admire you and I've learned to love you so much

169
00:06:18,921 --> 00:06:20,055
in this competition and

170
00:06:20,055 --> 00:06:21,624
you are a force

171
00:06:21,957 --> 00:06:23,459
- To be reckoned with.
- A hundred percent.

172
00:06:23,459 --> 00:06:24,794
- but not to be reckoned with.
- You really are.

173
00:06:25,594 --> 00:06:27,062
- I'm just a force.
- Just a force.

174
00:06:27,563 --> 00:06:28,831
- Aww, thank you.
- Force of disaster.

175
00:06:28,831 --> 00:06:29,732
Force sister.

176
00:06:29,732 --> 00:06:30,800
- No, you're really talented.
- Yeah.

177
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,903
The things that you do, the different facets of your drag,

178
00:06:33,936 --> 00:06:34,937
it's been amazing, really.

179
00:06:34,937 --> 00:06:37,339
The other girls see me as a threat now.

180
00:06:37,373 --> 00:06:38,707
Not just the funny queen.

181
00:06:38,707 --> 00:06:40,509
I'm not just like, you know,

182
00:06:40,509 --> 00:06:42,445
"We want to laugh, so let me talk to you."

183
00:06:42,445 --> 00:06:44,480
I also see you as the biggest threat

184
00:06:44,513 --> 00:06:46,515
because you are so well-rounded.

185
00:06:46,515 --> 00:06:49,151
You have no idea how you mothered

186
00:06:49,185 --> 00:06:50,319
- this competition.
- The whole season.

187
00:06:50,352 --> 00:06:51,921
- Like, you've mothered.
- Right.

188
00:06:51,954 --> 00:06:54,123
You did not only think about yourself,

189
00:06:54,123 --> 00:06:55,858
you thought about everyone.

190
00:06:55,891 --> 00:06:58,594
It's such an incomparable experience

191
00:06:58,594 --> 00:07:00,129
that I've had so far.

192
00:07:00,129 --> 00:07:02,131
Every single moment that we share

193
00:07:02,131 --> 00:07:05,000
has been unique in its own taste and flavor

194
00:07:05,034 --> 00:07:06,435
and it's been spicy.

195
00:07:06,435 --> 00:07:10,039
We should bring him to bathhouses. Just kidding!

196
00:07:13,442 --> 00:07:16,212
She's done already done had herses.

197
00:07:16,579 --> 00:07:18,247
Hello, hello, hello!

198
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:21,617
Are you ready to be a Slaysian Superstar?

199
00:07:21,784 --> 00:07:23,752
The spotlight is hot,

200
00:07:23,752 --> 00:07:25,187
but so are you.

201
00:07:25,354 --> 00:07:28,357
So don't just stand there, bitches.

202
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:29,291
Harmonize.

203
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:30,726
Harmonize?

204
00:07:30,726 --> 00:07:32,228
Mesmerize.

205
00:07:32,228 --> 00:07:35,731
And serve that big REYNA energy.
(Queen)

206
00:07:36,265 --> 00:07:37,633
Werk!

207
00:07:40,469 --> 00:07:42,137
Haller haller haller!

208
00:07:43,239 --> 00:07:43,806
Yay!

209
00:07:43,806 --> 00:07:45,341
The shoes!

210
00:07:45,341 --> 00:07:47,309
Oh, my God!

211
00:07:47,309 --> 00:07:48,110
Haller haller haller!

212
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:50,779
My fabulous, fantastic final four!

213
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,517
Condragulations, Slaysians! Yay!

214
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:56,552
You have proven that you are not just here to play,

215
00:07:56,552 --> 00:07:58,187
but you are here to slay,

216
00:07:58,187 --> 00:07:59,288
dominate,

217
00:07:59,288 --> 00:08:01,023
and preponderate.

218
00:08:01,557 --> 00:08:04,627
PREPONDERATE?!

219
00:08:04,627 --> 00:08:06,228
So we're going to celebrate

220
00:08:06,228 --> 00:08:07,830
Filipino style, Queens!

221
00:08:07,863 --> 00:08:10,799
Today, we're indulging in a beloved tradition,

222
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:12,801
the boodle fight!

223
00:08:12,801 --> 00:08:14,837
And while you savor this feast,

224
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:18,374
you'll also be serving us some realness in an intimate chit-chat

225
00:08:18,374 --> 00:08:20,876
with me, and Jervi “KaladKaren” Wrightson.

226
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:24,013
I'm so excited to have a kiki with Mama Pao

227
00:08:24,013 --> 00:08:27,283
for the first time that I won't feel that I'm being judged.

228
00:08:27,316 --> 00:08:28,717
I just feel that

229
00:08:28,751 --> 00:08:31,954
they want to get to know me better, and on a deeper level.

230
00:08:32,087 --> 00:08:34,323
After the feast, you'll head straight into your next

231
00:08:34,356 --> 00:08:37,493
Mini Challenge, the Yin and Yang Photoshoot Challenge.

232
00:08:37,493 --> 00:08:38,661
Brought to you by Cream Silk,

233
00:08:38,661 --> 00:08:40,863
the number one hair care brand in the Philippines.

234
00:08:40,896 --> 00:08:42,731
You'll each take part in a raw

235
00:08:42,731 --> 00:08:44,233
black and white photoshoot.

236
00:08:44,266 --> 00:08:45,134
No wigs!

237
00:08:45,134 --> 00:08:46,669
No heavy makeup.

238
00:08:46,702 --> 00:08:48,103
No glitter. Just you.

239
00:08:48,137 --> 00:08:49,838
The queen who delivers the most authentic

240
00:08:49,838 --> 00:08:51,874
and powerful and emotional shot

241
00:08:51,874 --> 00:08:53,075
will snatch the win.

242
00:08:53,108 --> 00:08:54,310
See you, Queens!

243
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:56,745
- See you!
- Bye, Mama Pao!

244
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:02,384
Mabuheeey!

245
00:09:02,418 --> 00:09:03,819
- Hello!
- Yay!

246
00:09:03,819 --> 00:09:05,454
Arizona Brandy!

247
00:09:05,454 --> 00:09:09,358
- Welcome to the Slaysian Fiesta Boodle Fight!
- Hi, Mama Pao.

248
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:12,328
I'm actually hungry, so,

249
00:09:12,361 --> 00:09:14,663
you know, I'm ready to boodle in.

250
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:17,032
So, while we're eating...

251
00:09:17,066 --> 00:09:20,269
Of course, you were the first runner-up in your season.

252
00:09:20,302 --> 00:09:23,305
And now, you're Top 4 here in Slaysian Royale.

253
00:09:23,305 --> 00:09:24,807
What kind of growth

254
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,343
do you think you've had since your season?

255
00:09:27,343 --> 00:09:29,778
Compared to my first season, I feel like

256
00:09:29,778 --> 00:09:32,314
I've grown mature,

257
00:09:32,314 --> 00:09:33,382
with my perspective and mindset.

258
00:09:33,382 --> 00:09:36,151
Before, I feel like I was all play

259
00:09:36,185 --> 00:09:37,853
but this time, I still like to play around

260
00:09:37,853 --> 00:09:39,722
but with much more focus.

261
00:09:39,755 --> 00:09:41,390
The only goal I had back then was

262
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:43,626
that I'm okay, as long as I'm not the Porkchop, I'll be happy.

263
00:09:43,626 --> 00:09:46,629
But now, I really want to win this time.

264
00:09:46,662 --> 00:09:48,897
I've heard you've gone through moments where you

265
00:09:48,897 --> 00:09:52,001
felt overlooked as a runner-up in your season.

266
00:09:52,034 --> 00:09:54,036
- Compared to the other runners up, like
- Yeah.

267
00:09:54,036 --> 00:09:55,337
- Marina and Khianna.
- Yeah.

268
00:09:55,371 --> 00:09:57,806
I got over that as well here.

269
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:00,009
And I've also realized and reminded myself that

270
00:10:00,042 --> 00:10:01,644
the three of us are so different.

271
00:10:01,677 --> 00:10:02,711
I want to be me.

272
00:10:02,711 --> 00:10:04,446
I don't want to be Marina.

273
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,382
I don't want to be like Khianna.

274
00:10:06,382 --> 00:10:07,983
I'm still going to do Arizona

275
00:10:08,017 --> 00:10:09,418
and you're going to love it

276
00:10:09,418 --> 00:10:11,120
whether you like it or not.

277
00:10:12,121 --> 00:10:13,589
That's right! So...

278
00:10:13,589 --> 00:10:16,592
You're fine with being an acquired taste.

279
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:18,494
If they don't like me, they will.

280
00:10:19,061 --> 00:10:19,795
They should.

281
00:10:20,562 --> 00:10:21,964
It's a requirement.

282
00:10:22,398 --> 00:10:24,133
Required taste.

283
00:10:24,133 --> 00:10:27,136
Required taste, not an acquired taste.

284
00:10:27,169 --> 00:10:29,238
- That's new. I love that.
- In all fairness.

285
00:10:29,238 --> 00:10:31,540
- Thank you very much, Arizona.
- Thank you, Arizona.

286
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:32,741
And good luck to you.

287
00:10:32,775 --> 00:10:33,375
Thank you.

288
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:35,644
- The Required Taste Queen.
- Yes.

289
00:10:35,711 --> 00:10:38,347
- Arizona Brandy!
- I'm a required taste!

290
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:40,983
I am so contented with my run here,

291
00:10:40,983 --> 00:10:42,551
with my journey here.

292
00:10:42,551 --> 00:10:45,587
I feel like I get to show them the other side of me.

293
00:10:45,621 --> 00:10:46,755
My drag

294
00:10:46,789 --> 00:10:48,924
can sometimes be rough around the edges

295
00:10:48,957 --> 00:10:50,092
I know, I'm aware and

296
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:50,959
I like it.

297
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:51,760
I love it.

298
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,961
That's who I am.

299
00:10:52,995 --> 00:10:54,129
I don't want to be perfect.

300
00:10:54,129 --> 00:10:55,397
I want the people,

301
00:10:55,397 --> 00:10:58,167
I want my fellow sisters outside

302
00:10:58,167 --> 00:10:59,301
watching this

303
00:10:59,301 --> 00:11:01,203
to relate to me.

304
00:11:03,972 --> 00:11:06,809
- Hi!
- Hi, Brigs!

305
00:11:06,809 --> 00:11:09,044
- Welcome!
- Wow! Hi!

306
00:11:09,078 --> 00:11:10,979
- Something's missing, Mama Pao.
- What's missing?

307
00:11:10,979 --> 00:11:12,247
I have a surprise for you.

308
00:11:12,281 --> 00:11:13,048
What is it?

309
00:11:13,048 --> 00:11:14,650
Surprise!

310
00:11:15,818 --> 00:11:18,587
I'm happy that I get to experience kiki time

311
00:11:18,587 --> 00:11:21,457
with Mama Pao and Mrs. Jervi Wrightson.

312
00:11:21,457 --> 00:11:24,226
I'm so happy because I never got to do it

313
00:11:24,259 --> 00:11:25,427
in my season.

314
00:11:25,461 --> 00:11:28,530
Brigiding, how does it feel to be part of the Top 4?

315
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:31,533
Surprisingly, I didn't really expect to be in the Top 4.

316
00:11:31,533 --> 00:11:34,603
- Really?
- All I wanted to do was to show you

317
00:11:34,636 --> 00:11:36,205
everything I have learned

318
00:11:36,238 --> 00:11:38,073
and who I really am.

319
00:11:38,073 --> 00:11:40,409
The Brigiding you were looking for since Season 1.

320
00:11:40,409 --> 00:11:42,111
During Season 1, I do feel

321
00:11:42,111 --> 00:11:43,545
that I was arrogant.

322
00:11:43,545 --> 00:11:44,813
Okay.

323
00:11:45,013 --> 00:11:46,982
Before coming into Season 1,

324
00:11:49,818 --> 00:11:52,254
I felt like I could do anything

325
00:11:52,287 --> 00:11:54,656
coming from a place where I was at the top.

326
00:11:54,656 --> 00:11:57,726
I was one of the most famous queens, touring around the world.

327
00:11:57,726 --> 00:12:00,062
And then the feedback I heard were

328
00:12:00,095 --> 00:12:03,065
that I was fading in the background, I was always safe.

329
00:12:03,132 --> 00:12:05,501
I had to lip sync for my life thrice.

330
00:12:05,501 --> 00:12:09,204
Instead of thinking that you were toying with me,

331
00:12:09,238 --> 00:12:11,340
what I did was, I worked hard

332
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:13,609
and find that Brigiding inside me.

333
00:12:13,609 --> 00:12:16,812
That drag queen inside me that you've always wanted to see.

334
00:12:16,812 --> 00:12:21,116
- A star really does live inside this tiny person.
- Of course, there is!

335
00:12:21,216 --> 00:12:23,619
So Brigiding, what message do you want to share with

336
00:12:23,652 --> 00:12:26,155
people who've experienced defeat where

337
00:12:26,155 --> 00:12:27,990
they felt like their story was over?

338
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:29,324
Do you remember what I said

339
00:12:29,324 --> 00:12:31,260
for my exit line in Season 1?

340
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:32,561
Learning is the new winning.

341
00:12:32,561 --> 00:12:34,329
I think I am here as

342
00:12:34,329 --> 00:12:35,597
my better version.

343
00:12:35,597 --> 00:12:38,734
Rubirthed, rubranded, learned my lessons,

344
00:12:38,734 --> 00:12:40,736
and I am here to win this time.

345
00:12:40,769 --> 00:12:41,503
Yes.

346
00:12:41,537 --> 00:12:43,939
Making it to the Top 4 is no small feat.

347
00:12:43,939 --> 00:12:45,874
So wishing you all the success ahead.

348
00:12:45,908 --> 00:12:46,542
This is me.

349
00:12:46,575 --> 00:12:47,376
This is the real me.

350
00:12:47,376 --> 00:12:49,011
You get the real me. This is my story.

351
00:12:49,044 --> 00:12:51,547
And I'm opening it all up to you because

352
00:12:51,547 --> 00:12:53,649
I need to do this for me to heal,

353
00:12:53,649 --> 00:12:54,650
figure things out,

354
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:56,885
for me to realize my best self

355
00:12:56,919 --> 00:12:59,121
with your help, and for me to win.

356
00:13:01,256 --> 00:13:04,059
Welcome to the Slaysian Fiesta Boodle Fight, Suki Doll!

357
00:13:04,092 --> 00:13:06,461
- Hi Mama Pao, KaladKaren!
- Hi, Suki!

358
00:13:06,495 --> 00:13:08,063
- Are you ready?
- Welcome.

359
00:13:08,096 --> 00:13:10,766
- Well, first of all, congratulations.
- Thank you.

360
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:13,602
Because out of all the seven international queens,

361
00:13:13,635 --> 00:13:16,705
you are the only one who made it to the Top 4.

362
00:13:16,705 --> 00:13:18,173
How does it feel?

363
00:13:18,173 --> 00:13:20,209
There's just not a lot of moments in my life

364
00:13:20,209 --> 00:13:22,277
where I'd step back and celebrate myself.

365
00:13:22,311 --> 00:13:24,279
Because I always celebrate people before me

366
00:13:24,313 --> 00:13:25,981
and I always put people's feelings before me.

367
00:13:25,981 --> 00:13:29,418
Being in the Top 4, stopping for a second and breathing,

368
00:13:29,451 --> 00:13:31,353
and realizing that I am-

369
00:13:31,353 --> 00:13:32,588
You are the celebration.

370
00:13:32,588 --> 00:13:36,191
That I'm the celebration and also that I'm worth celebrating.

371
00:13:36,225 --> 00:13:36,992
It feels amazing.

372
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:39,228
One of the biggest point in our cultures that

373
00:13:39,228 --> 00:13:41,663
- reunites Asia is our resilience.
- Yeah.

374
00:13:41,663 --> 00:13:43,699
Because the resilience that my mother taught me

375
00:13:43,699 --> 00:13:44,800
to become

376
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,603
is what I've used throughout my journey in drag

377
00:13:47,636 --> 00:13:50,105
and even in everyday life.

378
00:13:50,138 --> 00:13:51,406
Do you miss your mom?

379
00:13:51,506 --> 00:13:53,675
I miss her everyday.

380
00:13:53,742 --> 00:13:56,645
I just wish I had more time to tell her how much she has given me.

381
00:13:56,645 --> 00:13:59,281
We're from a family that was displaced from war.

382
00:13:59,348 --> 00:14:01,650
So I grew up in a land that is foreign to me

383
00:14:01,683 --> 00:14:03,151
and foreign to my family.

384
00:14:03,151 --> 00:14:06,321
So we learned languages and cultures that are not ours.

385
00:14:06,321 --> 00:14:09,191
And we weren't with people who looked like us.

386
00:14:09,191 --> 00:14:13,161
So, being celebrated in the Slaysian Royale is very special to me.

387
00:14:13,161 --> 00:14:14,897
This has been a healing journey for myself.

388
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:16,265
I'm so grateful to be here.

389
00:14:16,265 --> 00:14:17,399
Thank you for inspiring us

390
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:19,801
and we hope to see in the finale.

391
00:14:19,835 --> 00:14:21,737
- So, keep it up.
- Thank you.

392
00:14:21,737 --> 00:14:23,705
- Thank you so much.
- I'm so excited for you!

393
00:14:23,739 --> 00:14:25,807
These shared experiences that I'm giving are

394
00:14:25,841 --> 00:14:28,744
the ones that are so relatable to so many queer Asians

395
00:14:28,744 --> 00:14:30,846
that are not born in their own countries.

396
00:14:30,846 --> 00:14:33,348
I want to be sure that we are heard

397
00:14:33,348 --> 00:14:35,484
because we are also seen.

398
00:14:38,253 --> 00:14:39,388
Hello!

399
00:14:39,388 --> 00:14:42,557
- Haller haller haller haller! Welcome!
- Missus!

400
00:14:42,591 --> 00:14:44,293
This looks fun!

401
00:14:44,293 --> 00:14:46,328
- I can eat.
- Go ahead, eat.

402
00:14:46,628 --> 00:14:48,597
You've always been original,

403
00:14:48,597 --> 00:14:49,998
you've always been creative,

404
00:14:49,998 --> 00:14:53,068
- you've always been campy.
- Super creative. Always with so many ideas in her head.

405
00:14:53,068 --> 00:14:55,938
Full of life, full of energy, very witty.

406
00:14:55,938 --> 00:14:58,440
But now, Viñas is even better.

407
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,609
I think it's because of what you've learned

408
00:15:00,609 --> 00:15:01,810
during your season, right?

409
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:03,679
Because of the experiences I've had,

410
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:07,115
things that happened, for the past three years.

411
00:15:07,115 --> 00:15:09,518
So now, my take on Drag Race is

412
00:15:09,518 --> 00:15:11,887
a more mature take and

413
00:15:11,887 --> 00:15:13,956
and more ready to

414
00:15:13,989 --> 00:15:15,991
have a crown on my head.

415
00:15:17,059 --> 00:15:17,993
Love it.

416
00:15:18,226 --> 00:15:20,062
Who do you think you will be facing off with

417
00:15:20,095 --> 00:15:22,864
- in the finale?
- Who's taking the crown away from you?

418
00:15:23,131 --> 00:15:25,767
You know, before I even started drag,

419
00:15:25,767 --> 00:15:28,804
I was already super amazed by Brigiding.

420
00:15:28,837 --> 00:15:31,974
And then she lost her shine

421
00:15:32,007 --> 00:15:33,542
after our season.

422
00:15:33,542 --> 00:15:35,577
That's why I was so pleasantly surprised

423
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:39,014
when Slaysian Royale started.

424
00:15:39,047 --> 00:15:41,984
Because this is the Brigiding I've always known.

425
00:15:41,984 --> 00:15:44,786
And I'm so excited to lip sync with her

426
00:15:44,786 --> 00:15:46,388
because I want to beat the best.

427
00:15:46,421 --> 00:15:48,090
And I think she's the best.

428
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:50,092
- Viñas DeLuxe, hats off to you
- Thank you!

429
00:15:50,092 --> 00:15:52,327
for earning your spot in theTop 4.

430
00:15:52,327 --> 00:15:54,162
- Thank you.
- You've truly served excellence

431
00:15:54,196 --> 00:15:54,963
every step of the way.

432
00:15:54,963 --> 00:15:55,897
You’re truly so talented.

433
00:15:55,931 --> 00:15:59,901
Before they picked me up to come into the competition,

434
00:15:59,935 --> 00:16:03,071
from our province, my parents made the trip to the city

435
00:16:03,105 --> 00:16:05,007
just to tell me to do well,

436
00:16:05,007 --> 00:16:06,241
and that they believe in me.

437
00:16:06,274 --> 00:16:08,043
I was very touched by that and

438
00:16:08,076 --> 00:16:10,012
that's what I thought of when we started

439
00:16:10,012 --> 00:16:12,948
that's why I looked a little emotional.

440
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:15,784
My Queens!

441
00:16:15,784 --> 00:16:17,319
One queen in particular

442
00:16:17,319 --> 00:16:19,521
gave us a photo so vulnerable that

443
00:16:19,554 --> 00:16:22,691
it felt like we were looking straight into her soul.

444
00:16:22,691 --> 00:16:25,727
- Seven, who won our Mini Challenge?
- We don't have a winner today.

445
00:16:26,328 --> 00:16:27,396
We have a winner today!

446
00:16:27,662 --> 00:16:30,866
For today's Mini Challenge our winner is

447
00:16:33,168 --> 00:16:34,369
Viñas.

448
00:16:39,107 --> 00:16:40,809
My God, I'm a slayer also.

449
00:16:40,809 --> 00:16:42,277
I'm a Slaysian!

450
00:16:42,577 --> 00:16:45,981
Thank you!
- You won cash tip of 20,000 pesos!

451
00:16:45,981 --> 00:16:47,749
Thank you!

454
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:54,156
- Once again, thank you very much, Seven!
- Thank you.

455
00:16:54,156 --> 00:16:56,458
- Thank you Seven!
- Thank you, good luck!

456
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:58,960
- Thank you! So cute.
- Thank you, Seven!

457
00:16:58,994 --> 00:17:00,262
My Top 4.

458
00:17:00,262 --> 00:17:04,032
This is the penultimate challenge before the grand finale.

459
00:17:04,066 --> 00:17:05,901
PENULTIMATE?!

460
00:17:05,901 --> 00:17:07,369
For your last Maxi Challenge

461
00:17:07,369 --> 00:17:09,104
you will star in a music video

462
00:17:09,104 --> 00:17:12,374
and transform into the slay-gendary divas you were meant to be.

463
00:17:12,374 --> 00:17:13,608
Brought to you by Cream Silk,

464
00:17:13,642 --> 00:17:16,511
the ultimate in hair care for your fiercest transformation.

465
00:17:16,545 --> 00:17:19,047
I have not really done music videos before,

466
00:17:19,047 --> 00:17:22,084
so this is going to be an interesting experience.

467
00:17:22,084 --> 00:17:24,319
Each queen, you'll have ten minutes

468
00:17:24,352 --> 00:17:25,420
of shooting time.

469
00:17:25,454 --> 00:17:27,122
The winner of the Mini Challenge can steal

470
00:17:27,122 --> 00:17:29,257
two minutes from other queens' shooting time.

471
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:31,760
Two minutes can make or break the competition.

472
00:17:31,827 --> 00:17:34,229
Viñas, who's the queen that you're taking

473
00:17:34,229 --> 00:17:36,298
- the two minutes from?
- You're looking too far away, Arizona.

474
00:17:36,298 --> 00:17:38,366
I'm just looking for something, sis. Hold on.

475
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,969
I want to give it to the person

476
00:17:40,969 --> 00:17:43,905
who is very good in improv.

477
00:17:43,905 --> 00:17:46,274
So, I think the most confident

478
00:17:46,308 --> 00:17:48,343
is Arizona.

479
00:17:51,146 --> 00:17:53,048
Why me?

480
00:17:53,348 --> 00:17:56,118
This is crazy. What the hell?

481
00:17:56,118 --> 00:17:57,519
She's crazy.

482
00:17:57,519 --> 00:17:59,221
Two minutes is two minutes.

483
00:17:59,321 --> 00:18:00,989
That's a lot of time.

484
00:18:01,022 --> 00:18:02,991
So, Viñas DeLuxe, you're taking away

485
00:18:02,991 --> 00:18:05,560
two minutes from Arizona's shooting time.

486
00:18:05,594 --> 00:18:08,964
And because this is Drag Race Philippines: Slaysian Royale,

487
00:18:08,997 --> 00:18:10,332
for our Maxi Challenge,

488
00:18:10,365 --> 00:18:14,870
you will be coached by our Supergroup Queens...

489
00:18:14,936 --> 00:18:17,072
REYN4!

490
00:18:18,507 --> 00:18:21,109
Who the fuck is REYN4, girl?

491
00:18:21,109 --> 00:18:23,044
Captivating KatKat!

492
00:18:23,778 --> 00:18:26,548
Hi, sisters!

493
00:18:26,548 --> 00:18:28,283
Oh, my God!

494
00:18:28,283 --> 00:18:30,519
Am I pretty in person?

495
00:18:31,419 --> 00:18:34,055
Marina Summers!

496
00:18:34,389 --> 00:18:37,125
Asia, it's summertime!

497
00:18:37,792 --> 00:18:39,561
- Hi, girls!
- Maxie!

498
00:18:39,594 --> 00:18:41,863
Wow, Maxie!

499
00:18:41,897 --> 00:18:43,999
Fuck you all, now what?

500
00:18:44,099 --> 00:18:46,301
Let's fuck this shit up!

501
00:18:46,568 --> 00:18:49,070
And Precious Paula Nicole!

502
00:18:53,675 --> 00:18:56,745
No make up!

503
00:19:04,753 --> 00:19:07,522
Queens, you are about to witness the birth

504
00:19:07,522 --> 00:19:10,892
of Drag Race Universe's newest and fiercest supergroup.

505
00:19:10,892 --> 00:19:14,930
Bow down to our supergroup, REYN4!

506
00:19:15,764 --> 00:19:17,532
With their single, High Time.

507
00:19:17,532 --> 00:19:20,001
And Mama Pao, I want to introduce my girls.

508
00:19:20,035 --> 00:19:20,936
Marina

509
00:19:20,969 --> 00:19:22,370
as the leader.

510
00:19:22,971 --> 00:19:25,006
Precious as the dancer.

511
00:19:25,574 --> 00:19:27,209
Maxie as the singer.

512
00:19:27,409 --> 00:19:29,377
And me, as the manager.

513
00:19:29,744 --> 00:19:32,847
If you want us, just call me, I'll give you a discount.

514
00:19:33,782 --> 00:19:37,485
REYN4 is the first ever all-Filipina

515
00:19:37,519 --> 00:19:39,588
drag supergroup that is launched

516
00:19:39,588 --> 00:19:42,090
into global superstardom by World of Wonder.

517
00:19:42,123 --> 00:19:45,026
to represent not only Philippine drag excellence but

518
00:19:45,026 --> 00:19:46,928
also Asian excellence.

519
00:19:46,928 --> 00:19:48,930
That's why we're here finally setting foot

520
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:50,532
on Drag Race Philippines as a group.

521
00:19:50,565 --> 00:19:53,001
And we are so, so happy to be here.

522
00:19:53,134 --> 00:19:55,370
It's very, very important because we have a lot of

523
00:19:55,403 --> 00:19:57,839
of Filipino drag queens who are very, very talented.

524
00:19:57,839 --> 00:19:59,841
So it's very, very important to us

525
00:19:59,841 --> 00:20:00,909
to show what we got.

526
00:20:00,909 --> 00:20:02,711
It proves that nothing is impossible.

527
00:20:02,711 --> 00:20:03,378
Correct.

528
00:20:03,378 --> 00:20:05,513
Even talented drag queens can be

529
00:20:05,513 --> 00:20:06,581
- a recording artist.
- Yes.

530
00:20:06,581 --> 00:20:09,784
And be the superstars that we already are.

531
00:20:09,784 --> 00:20:10,619
Oh, yes.

532
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,889
And you can be a talented manager too.

533
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:19,094
So Queens, you better Slay Accla because tomorrow

534
00:20:19,127 --> 00:20:22,163
on the panel we will be joined by our extra special judges

535
00:20:22,163 --> 00:20:24,399
from Drag Race Philippines Season 1 and

536
00:20:24,399 --> 00:20:26,334
UK Versus the World Season 2.

537
00:20:26,368 --> 00:20:29,904
She's born to do drag, Marina Summers.

538
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,442
Also joining us from Drag Race Season Season 16

539
00:20:34,442 --> 00:20:37,579

- Oh, my gosh.

540
00:20:37,612 --> 00:20:39,614
Nymphia Wind!

541
00:20:40,582 --> 00:20:42,050
And on the Runway category is,

542
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:45,253
- Award Giving Body-yodi-yodi-yodies!
- Yes.

00:20:45,253 --> 00:20:48,156
Show us your award-winning look on the red carpet.

544
00:20:48,223 --> 00:20:50,091
#SlaysianRoyale

545
00:20:50,091 --> 00:20:50,859
Yes!

546
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:53,795
Now get to work, my Slaysian Pop Sensations!

547
00:20:53,795 --> 00:20:55,263
Later our REYN4 super group,

548
00:20:55,263 --> 00:20:57,632
will check on your maxi challenge preparation.

549
00:20:57,699 --> 00:20:58,700
Let's go Supergroup!

550
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:02,003
- Let's go!
- Let's get a snack!

551
00:21:02,037 --> 00:21:03,438
- Bye!
- Bye, sis!

552
00:21:07,242 --> 00:21:09,044
How do you guys feel?

553
00:21:10,278 --> 00:21:12,280
This is it, sisters.

554
00:21:12,547 --> 00:21:15,483
- Very, very excited because
- Yeah.

555
00:21:15,483 --> 00:21:18,853
this is the first time that we are doing this in the history of

556
00:21:18,853 --> 00:21:20,722
the whole Drag Race world.

557
00:21:20,722 --> 00:21:21,323
- Wow.
- Yes.

558
00:21:21,356 --> 00:21:22,824
To have a girl group.

559
00:21:22,857 --> 00:21:25,293
We're not just starring in this music video.

560
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:28,296
Like, we get to write our verses.

561
00:21:28,296 --> 00:21:31,333
And our verses should tell a story about our journey here.

562
00:21:31,433 --> 00:21:34,803
- Thank you for that disadvantage, sis.
- Oopsie.

563
00:21:36,871 --> 00:21:38,139
It's okay because,

564
00:21:38,173 --> 00:21:39,974
whatever we do, we need to give that

565
00:21:39,974 --> 00:21:41,376
- that disadvantage.
- To somebody.

566
00:21:41,409 --> 00:21:42,610
So it's okay.

567
00:21:42,644 --> 00:21:43,611
- It's Su-kay?
- Yes.

568
00:21:43,611 --> 00:21:45,480
- You'll be fine.
- You better help me with this.

569
00:21:46,281 --> 00:21:48,416
But you have more time, so yours has to be extra good.

570
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:49,084
Yes.

571
00:21:49,117 --> 00:21:50,719
Thank you for pressuring me.

572
00:21:50,719 --> 00:21:51,920
I mean, it's true.

573
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,289
It's so exciting to write lyrics

574
00:21:54,322 --> 00:21:56,324
I don't particularly enjoy doing it, but

575
00:21:56,358 --> 00:21:58,259
it's the most fulfilling thing to accomplish.

576
00:21:58,259 --> 00:22:02,030
- Let's listen to the music now.
- Yes, excited to listen.

577
00:22:02,063 --> 00:22:04,499
If I want to win this challenge that is new to me,

578
00:22:04,532 --> 00:22:06,368
I need to be sure that I'm organized

579
00:22:06,368 --> 00:22:08,570
and I have all this prepared in advance.

580
00:22:08,603 --> 00:22:11,272
And obviously, practice, practice, practice.

581
00:22:11,306 --> 00:22:13,508
I want to tell my story throughout the song.

582
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:14,609
To be honest,

583
00:22:14,609 --> 00:22:17,178
I want to expand to the music industry.

584
00:22:17,212 --> 00:22:19,347
I want to make more music!

585
00:22:23,118 --> 00:22:26,354
We’re gonna do a RuMix to an original song, “High Time”

586
00:22:26,388 --> 00:22:30,859
and we're going to be coached by our sisters, REYN4!

587
00:22:30,992 --> 00:22:34,562
Thank God the super REYN4 is here to guide me

588
00:22:34,562 --> 00:22:35,463
Because

589
00:22:35,897 --> 00:22:38,433
who would help me but them.

590
00:22:38,433 --> 00:22:39,834
Because this is their song,

591
00:22:39,834 --> 00:22:41,703
REYN4’s song “High Time”.

592
00:22:41,936 --> 00:22:44,139
I’m so happy to hear advices from

593
00:22:44,139 --> 00:22:45,807
Maxie and Marina who’s super good and pretty.

594
00:22:45,807 --> 00:22:46,641
Maxie and Marina who’s super good and pretty.

595
00:22:46,641 --> 00:22:47,409
Maxie and Marina who’s super good and pretty.

596
00:22:47,409 --> 00:22:49,744
They’re so well in terms of recording.

597
00:22:49,744 --> 00:22:52,547
Precious, of course, as a supporter.

598
00:22:52,547 --> 00:22:53,848
And

599
00:22:53,848 --> 00:22:56,217
Katkat as the manager.

600
00:22:57,919 --> 00:22:59,654
Suki Doll.

601
00:22:59,854 --> 00:23:02,490
Suki for the crown, got them gagging on the Runway

602
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:05,994
Polyglot Princess, I finesse in the ten way

603
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:07,595
- I think he's off-beat.
- Yeah.

604
00:23:07,629 --> 00:23:11,065
Polyglot Princess, I finesse in like ten way

605
00:23:11,699 --> 00:23:13,935
The recording was okay, it was not the top,

606
00:23:13,935 --> 00:23:15,837
but I was obviously a little bit in my head.

607
00:23:15,837 --> 00:23:18,440
Polyglot Princess, finesse it like ten way

608
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,073
Yeah.

609
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:21,943
Polyglot Princess, finesse like a ten way

610
00:23:21,976 --> 00:23:23,545
- No.
- Finesse it like ten way

611
00:23:23,545 --> 00:23:25,013
Finesse it like ten way

612
00:23:25,146 --> 00:23:28,316
Now she's slaying the Runway, serving you fashion

613
00:23:28,316 --> 00:23:31,653
Funny in English, no translation

614
00:23:33,955 --> 00:23:36,224
I want to prove I can sing, because

615
00:23:36,257 --> 00:23:37,425
you know, I can!

616
00:23:37,425 --> 00:23:39,561
Duh!

617
00:23:40,395 --> 00:23:42,096
Take a shot if you get back up

618
00:23:42,096 --> 00:23:43,431
Yes I'm still around

619
00:23:43,431 --> 00:23:46,501
- Yeah!
- Spicy!

620
00:23:46,634 --> 00:23:48,169
Slaygendary, slaygacy

621
00:23:48,169 --> 00:23:49,537
I'm the brightest star

622
00:23:49,571 --> 00:23:50,839
Filipinas to the world

623
00:23:50,839 --> 00:23:52,674
Watch me go far

624
00:23:52,674 --> 00:23:55,343
From the Philippines to the world, watch me go far

625
00:23:55,343 --> 00:23:56,778
- Watch me go far.
- Yeah.

626
00:23:56,778 --> 00:23:58,513
To make the flow better.

627
00:23:58,546 --> 00:24:02,350
Heart full of fire always shining-ni-ning-ning-ding!

628
00:24:02,383 --> 00:24:04,018
Can you do it like

629
00:24:04,052 --> 00:24:06,621
Heart full of fire dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun

630
00:24:06,621 --> 00:24:08,156
We build it up.

631
00:24:08,156 --> 00:24:09,023
Sing it first.

632
00:24:09,057 --> 00:24:10,525
Yeah, that's good, Maxie.

633
00:24:10,525 --> 00:24:12,360
- I know, right?
- That's a great suggestion.

634
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,528
- You should do that.
- Right, manager?

635
00:24:13,561 --> 00:24:14,429
I'm nervous because

636
00:24:14,429 --> 00:24:16,331
it might reflect in the recording

637
00:24:16,331 --> 00:24:17,832
how I struggled with the lyrics.

638
00:24:17,866 --> 00:24:20,835
So, I'm not sure, maybe it won't?

639
00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:24,172
The pressure, Precious is here again.

640
00:24:24,172 --> 00:24:26,407
Precious really pressures you.

641
00:24:26,875 --> 00:24:28,243
Smart take, Elevate,

642
00:24:28,276 --> 00:24:31,212
- Always out of the box. Dare dream.
- Do it again.

643
00:24:31,246 --> 00:24:33,615
If you can bring in the groove there like

644
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:35,416
Dance with it.

645
00:24:35,416 --> 00:24:36,551
So it doesn't sound too rap-y.

646
00:24:36,551 --> 00:24:38,686
She has that voice. She already has that.

647
00:24:38,686 --> 00:24:41,756
All she has to do is to focus and to enjoy.

648
00:24:41,856 --> 00:24:44,792
Smart take, elevate, always out of the box

649
00:24:44,792 --> 00:24:46,160
Dare to dream, do the work

650
00:24:46,194 --> 00:24:47,829
And make it DeLuxe

651
00:24:47,829 --> 00:24:49,330
Make it DeLuxe

652
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:51,065
This is your note

653
00:24:51,065 --> 00:24:52,700
- Viñas
- Make it DeLuxe

654
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,035
That's it.

655
00:24:54,035 --> 00:24:55,670
I've always been an overthinker

656
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:57,105
ever since the beginning.

657
00:24:57,105 --> 00:25:00,708
This time, overthinking while taking risks and

658
00:25:00,708 --> 00:25:03,511
I'm becoming hard on myself because I want to do good.

659
00:25:03,578 --> 00:25:04,979
Showing versatility

660
00:25:04,979 --> 00:25:06,247
Being me my priority

661
00:25:06,247 --> 00:25:07,682
This is for my family

662
00:25:07,682 --> 00:25:09,050
Mom and dad don't you worry

663
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:10,552
I just have a suggestion.

664
00:25:10,552 --> 00:25:13,254
I just want to re-do the "my family" part

665
00:25:13,254 --> 00:25:15,857
- because you were almost mumbling the lyrics.
- It wasn't highlighted well.

666
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:17,859
Viñas has this tendency

667
00:25:17,859 --> 00:25:19,460
when she starts to fuck up doing something,

668
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:20,795
she'll still push to finish it,

669
00:25:20,828 --> 00:25:22,997
but the results will be, 'who cares' to her.

670
00:25:22,997 --> 00:25:25,867
I just hope the outcome is good because

671
00:25:25,867 --> 00:25:28,670
she's been in the bottom twice for the last

672
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:29,971
two weeks, so,

673
00:25:30,004 --> 00:25:31,739
I cannot afford to see her again

674
00:25:31,739 --> 00:25:34,409
lip syncing for her life this time.

675
00:25:36,444 --> 00:25:39,013
- Say hi!
- Hi, Queens!

676
00:25:39,013 --> 00:25:41,215
I am Nunoy, I will be your choreographer

677
00:25:41,215 --> 00:25:43,551
for the Supergroup music video.

678
00:25:43,551 --> 00:25:46,254
So yeah, it's Nunoy who's gonna give us the choreography.

679
00:25:46,254 --> 00:25:47,989
As a trained dancer,

680
00:25:47,989 --> 00:25:49,357
I know I can do this.

681
00:25:49,357 --> 00:25:52,794
So let's go. Whatever step you have for us, Nunoy.

682
00:25:52,794 --> 00:25:53,294
Do it!

683
00:25:53,294 --> 00:25:57,899
Seven, eight, one, two, out, three, and four.

684
00:25:58,499 --> 00:25:59,133
Yes.

685
00:25:59,133 --> 00:26:00,535
I had fun!

686
00:26:00,535 --> 00:26:01,569
The steps were easy.

687
00:26:01,569 --> 00:26:03,137
It wasn't like - pak, pak, pak, pak, pak, pak.

688
00:26:03,438 --> 00:26:06,274
Seven, and boom, boom, boom, boom!

689
00:26:06,274 --> 00:26:08,977
Ha, ha, ha, ha, touch, touch, touch, and

690
00:26:08,977 --> 00:26:10,378
tap, tap, tap, tap!

691
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:12,347
Are we good?

692
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:15,650
The most difficult part for me is memorizing the song.

693
00:26:15,683 --> 00:26:17,485
And of course if I don't memorize it,

694
00:26:17,485 --> 00:26:20,588
I won't be able to give 100% to the steps I learned.

695
00:26:20,622 --> 00:26:24,192
Inwards and- ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-stop!

696
00:26:24,659 --> 00:26:26,661
Practice, practice, practice, practice, okay, good.

697
00:26:26,694 --> 00:26:28,696
Nunoy's giving me all these new beats and

698
00:26:28,696 --> 00:26:31,833
new moves and she's popping every beat and half beats.

699
00:26:31,866 --> 00:26:33,434
It's giving a lot.

700
00:26:33,434 --> 00:26:34,969
What part do you...

701
00:26:35,103 --> 00:26:36,537
I think it's more the pulling.

702
00:26:36,571 --> 00:26:41,042
- Okay, so right, left, grab it, in.
- At the last part.

703
00:26:41,075 --> 00:26:43,711
I'm so burned out. It so difficult right now

704
00:26:43,711 --> 00:26:45,346
but I'm trying to push through.

705
00:26:48,216 --> 00:26:51,519
So, right now, we're going to be shooting the music video.

706
00:26:51,519 --> 00:26:53,554
You know, as a model myself,

707
00:26:53,588 --> 00:26:57,325
I'm very excited to like, emote, emote, and project, project.

708
00:26:57,325 --> 00:26:58,926
3, 2, 1 cue music!

709
00:26:59,193 --> 00:27:00,395
Yes!

710
00:27:00,395 --> 00:27:02,130
I don't think you can lick the wall.

711
00:27:06,968 --> 00:27:08,903
I'm so happy and so glad.

712
00:27:08,903 --> 00:27:10,271
To see them there.

713
00:27:10,271 --> 00:27:10,838
There’s a sense of comfort.

714
00:27:10,838 --> 00:27:12,473
There’s a sense of comfort.

715
00:27:12,473 --> 00:27:15,343
Because I know they have us, they got us.

716
00:27:15,343 --> 00:27:16,377
They got our backs,

717
00:27:16,611 --> 00:27:17,745
I'm going to enjoy.

718
00:27:17,745 --> 00:27:18,980
And I'm so thankful

719
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:21,883
I have Precious and Marina by my side.

720
00:27:24,052 --> 00:27:25,920
Big Reyna energy!

721
00:27:28,923 --> 00:27:30,758
Okay.

722
00:27:31,059 --> 00:27:33,194
We're shooting and there's nothing

723
00:27:33,227 --> 00:27:34,028
that I'm getting on.

724
00:27:34,028 --> 00:27:35,930
It's a little bit stressful.

725
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:37,265
I don't even know what to think

726
00:27:37,298 --> 00:27:39,200
because my head is like going blank.

727
00:27:39,767 --> 00:27:40,568
You okay?

728
00:27:40,568 --> 00:27:41,736
Yeah, just cramping.

729
00:27:41,736 --> 00:27:43,171
- Cramping?
- Cramping.

730
00:27:43,204 --> 00:27:45,039
Oof, we're shooting the solo part

731
00:27:45,073 --> 00:27:46,307
and my legs are cramping.

732
00:27:46,307 --> 00:27:48,443
The body is really not happy.

733
00:27:48,443 --> 00:27:50,078
This is the last stretch and

734
00:27:50,111 --> 00:27:52,146
the body hasn't stretched properly, I guess.

735
00:27:52,146 --> 00:27:54,115
I'm not as focused anymore.

736
00:27:54,115 --> 00:27:56,017
I don't know how this is going to look like.

737
00:27:56,984 --> 00:27:59,353
Seeing them, I want to be like them.

738
00:27:59,353 --> 00:28:01,489
I need to do everything to be like them.

739
00:28:01,489 --> 00:28:03,958
But I forgot that I just need to be me.

740
00:28:03,991 --> 00:28:05,760
And then it got me.

741
00:28:06,194 --> 00:28:07,361
Pressure.

742
00:28:07,795 --> 00:28:08,996
Hey!

743
00:28:11,032 --> 00:28:13,000
Go, go, go, go!

744
00:28:14,502 --> 00:28:16,170
It's so ridiculous!

745
00:28:16,204 --> 00:28:18,606
Everything I learned—the lyrics and the dance,

746
00:28:18,639 --> 00:28:20,074
I forgot them all.

747
00:28:20,074 --> 00:28:21,709
I don't know why.

748
00:28:22,043 --> 00:28:24,946
- Don't stress about the time.
- Your focus, Vinas is to have fun.

749
00:28:24,979 --> 00:28:27,782
You're way too fixated on the time! Silly girl.

750
00:28:27,782 --> 00:28:29,984
I rehearsed this so much, why is it gone?

751
00:28:30,017 --> 00:28:31,052
As in, gone.

752
00:28:31,085 --> 00:28:32,320
I blacked out during the shoot.

753
00:28:32,687 --> 00:28:34,388
Can we fix her hair quickly?

754
00:28:34,388 --> 00:28:35,223
Yes, please.

755
00:28:35,223 --> 00:28:37,859
Do we have a brush?

756
00:28:37,892 --> 00:28:39,560
Wait, yeah okay face front.

757
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:41,763
If they weren't there, I'd probably be

758
00:28:41,763 --> 00:28:43,698
more nervous, and wouldn't have shown

759
00:28:43,731 --> 00:28:46,634
my personality, comedic bits, and my flirty moves.

760
00:28:46,634 --> 00:28:49,470
I just told you not to think about the time!

761
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:51,038
3, 2, 1, cue music!

762
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:52,406
Yeah!

763
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,475
Sexier, come on!

764
00:28:54,475 --> 00:28:56,144
Yes!

765
00:28:59,814 --> 00:29:02,450
What I really learned from the two queens,

766
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:04,886
is to enjoy and give

767
00:29:04,919 --> 00:29:07,755
variations and amp up the energy.

768
00:29:07,789 --> 00:29:09,490
There are no reservations.

769
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:11,225
This is the last week before the grand finale

770
00:29:11,225 --> 00:29:12,994
so I needed to give it my all.

771
00:29:12,994 --> 00:29:15,563
Because you don't know if you'll even get that far!

772
00:29:17,431 --> 00:29:19,767
- I love it!
- Good job! That's good!

773
00:29:43,357 --> 00:29:45,526
Mabuheeey! I am your mothertucking host and

774
00:29:45,526 --> 00:29:46,360
welcome to the Main Stage of

775
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:49,897
Drag Race Philippines: Slaysian Royale.

776
00:29:49,931 --> 00:29:51,399
It's our Filipina diva.

777
00:29:51,399 --> 00:29:54,635
Fine, fresh, fierce, on a silver platter.

778
00:29:54,635 --> 00:29:56,437
Marina Summers. Hello, Marina.

779
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:58,406
Are you excited to see what the Slaysian Top 4

780
00:29:58,406 --> 00:29:59,907
has in store for us today?

781
00:30:00,508 --> 00:30:02,043
Hello. Hi. Mabuhay, Mama Pao!

782
00:30:02,043 --> 00:30:04,846
I am more than excited and I cannot wait

783
00:30:04,846 --> 00:30:06,714
to see which fierce queen will win tonight

784
00:30:06,714 --> 00:30:09,517
and reign as the baddest bitch in the game, no?

785
00:30:10,351 --> 00:30:12,153
But before that Mama Pao...

786
00:30:12,386 --> 00:30:14,155
Do the Marina!

787
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:18,426
- Yes!
- Yay!

788
00:30:18,893 --> 00:30:19,560
Thank you, Marina.

789
00:30:19,594 --> 00:30:21,996
Next up is RuPaul's Drag Race Season 16 Winner,

790
00:30:21,996 --> 00:30:24,098
the Queen of the Wind, Nymphia Wind.

791
00:30:24,365 --> 00:30:25,800
Nymphia, hello.

792
00:30:25,833 --> 00:30:26,934
Welcome to the Philippines.

793
00:30:26,968 --> 00:30:28,636
Do you like our bananas here?

794
00:30:28,936 --> 00:30:31,038
Hello, Mama Pao!

795
00:30:31,038 --> 00:30:32,607
Love the bananas here.

796
00:30:32,607 --> 00:30:34,909
They're so juicy, so thick,

797
00:30:34,909 --> 00:30:37,778
so luscious, and just so yellow.

798
00:30:38,112 --> 00:30:40,381
Oh, I think that's a dirty banana.

799
00:30:40,748 --> 00:30:43,851
I'll have some good ones bananas for you later.

800
00:30:43,951 --> 00:30:45,419
Thank you, Marina and Nymphia.

801
00:30:46,287 --> 00:30:48,155

Hit it!

814
00:31:21,322 --> 00:31:22,590
Oh, my God!

815
00:31:22,957 --> 00:31:25,159
That was so fun!

816
00:31:26,727 --> 00:31:27,161
Wait.

817
00:31:27,795 --> 00:31:29,297
It's all ready?

818
00:31:36,537 --> 00:31:37,672
Suki for the crown

819
00:31:37,705 --> 00:31:39,340
Got 'em gagging on the Runway

820
00:31:39,373 --> 00:31:40,708
Polyglot princess

821
00:31:40,741 --> 00:31:42,076
I finesse it like ten way

822
00:31:42,109 --> 00:31:43,077
Tongue so sharp

823
00:31:43,144 --> 00:31:44,812
Every win like a needle

824
00:31:44,845 --> 00:31:45,813
Asian excellence

825
00:31:45,813 --> 00:31:47,548
Yeah, this doll be lethal

826
00:31:47,581 --> 00:31:48,549
Mother mother shines

827
00:31:48,582 --> 00:31:49,951
Just like a star

828
00:31:50,184 --> 00:31:51,152
Dressed in gold

829
00:31:51,185 --> 00:31:52,853
Finer than she is

830
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,021
Triple bloodline

831
00:31:54,055 --> 00:31:55,690
Got the culture in the fine wire

832
00:31:55,723 --> 00:31:56,657
Tongue talk slick

833
00:31:56,724 --> 00:31:58,592
French kissin’ on the punchlines

834
00:31:59,093 --> 00:32:02,096
Can you handle this big Reyna energy?

835
00:32:02,096 --> 00:32:03,164
I think not

836
00:32:03,197 --> 00:32:04,732
Nah, 'cause it's high time

837
00:32:04,932 --> 00:32:05,633
High time

838
00:32:05,633 --> 00:32:07,635
That you noticed it's my time

839
00:32:07,668 --> 00:32:08,369
I shine

840
00:32:08,369 --> 00:32:10,371
Every single time that I climb

841
00:32:10,404 --> 00:32:11,872
Those stairs to the stage

842
00:32:12,106 --> 00:32:14,475
Who you think done put you on the map, babes?

843
00:32:14,508 --> 00:32:16,844
Even stars catch fire

844
00:32:17,011 --> 00:32:19,547
Watch us light up the sky

845
00:32:19,947 --> 00:32:22,116
Baby, dreams don't expire

846
00:32:22,149 --> 00:32:24,518
So raise 'em high

847
00:32:24,585 --> 00:32:25,653
Now whatchu know about?

848
00:32:25,753 --> 00:32:27,054
Big Reyna energy

849
00:32:27,455 --> 00:32:28,456
Big energy

850
00:32:28,522 --> 00:32:30,157
Big Reyna energy

851
00:32:30,191 --> 00:32:31,192
Big energy

852
00:32:31,225 --> 00:32:32,860
Big Reyna energy

853
00:32:32,927 --> 00:32:33,928
Big energy

854
00:32:33,961 --> 00:32:36,263
Who you think done put you on the map, babes?

855
00:32:36,263 --> 00:32:37,999
Take a shot! If you're put aside

856
00:32:38,032 --> 00:32:39,000
Always beaten down

857
00:32:39,033 --> 00:32:40,701
Take a shot! If you'll get back up

858
00:32:40,735 --> 00:32:41,936
Yes I'm still around!

859
00:32:41,969 --> 00:32:43,137
But this time I'm not joking

860
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:44,472
Ready for the second round

861
00:32:44,505 --> 00:32:45,806
Can't ever let nobody

862
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,341
else take away my crown

863
00:32:47,341 --> 00:32:48,776
Now I’m slaying the Runway,

864
00:32:48,809 --> 00:32:50,277
Serving you fashion

865
00:32:50,311 --> 00:32:53,347
Funny in english (no translations)
Pour everything out

866
00:32:53,347 --> 00:32:54,382
Every last drop

867
00:32:54,382 --> 00:32:56,384
Arizona’s back, ready to attack

868
00:32:56,417 --> 00:32:58,452
Babe you better pack your bags

869
00:32:58,452 --> 00:33:01,889
I don’t think you can handle this big Reyna energy

870
00:33:01,889 --> 00:33:03,090
Certainly not

871
00:33:03,257 --> 00:33:04,892
Yeah, cuz it’s high time

872
00:33:04,925 --> 00:33:05,626
High time

873
00:33:05,626 --> 00:33:07,328
That you noticed it’s my time

874
00:33:07,661 --> 00:33:08,362
Big vibes

875
00:33:08,396 --> 00:33:10,097
Every single time that I serve

876
00:33:10,431 --> 00:33:12,066
This hair and the face

877
00:33:12,133 --> 00:33:14,468
Who you think done put you on the map, babes?

878
00:33:14,502 --> 00:33:16,804
Even stars catch fire

879
00:33:17,004 --> 00:33:19,573
Watch us light up the sky

880
00:33:19,907 --> 00:33:22,109
Baby dreams don’t expire

881
00:33:22,109 --> 00:33:24,578
So raise ‘em high

882
00:33:24,645 --> 00:33:25,679
It’s my time!

883
00:33:25,713 --> 00:33:26,747
I’ve been through the fire

884
00:33:26,747 --> 00:33:28,082
I’ve been through the storm

885
00:33:28,115 --> 00:33:29,383
Rubirth, rubranded

886
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:30,951
I was born to transform.

887
00:33:31,018 --> 00:33:33,521
Darling believe it you’re always on top!

888
00:33:33,554 --> 00:33:36,257
Rise up, sail on, take flight, keep believing, don’t stop!

889
00:33:36,257 --> 00:33:37,625
Slaygendary, slaygacy

890
00:33:37,658 --> 00:33:38,959
I’m the brightest star

891
00:33:38,993 --> 00:33:40,327
From Philippines to the world

892
00:33:40,361 --> 00:33:42,029
Watch me go far!

893
00:33:42,029 --> 00:33:44,432
Mother Brigiding, don't stop never tire

894
00:33:44,465 --> 00:33:45,766
Heart full of fire

895
00:33:45,766 --> 00:33:48,002
Always shining-ni-ning-ning-Ding!

896
00:33:48,135 --> 00:33:51,105
Can you handle this big Reyna energy?

897
00:33:51,172 --> 00:33:52,239
I think not

898
00:33:52,273 --> 00:33:53,941
Nah, ‘cause it’s high time

899
00:33:53,974 --> 00:33:54,675
High time

900
00:33:54,742 --> 00:33:56,710

00:33:56,744 --> 00:33:57,411
I shine

902
00:33:57,445 --> 00:33:59,413
Every single time that I climb

903
00:33:59,447 --> 00:34:01,182
Those stairs to the stage

904
00:34:01,182 --> 00:34:03,517
Who you think done put you on the map, babes?

905
00:34:03,551 --> 00:34:05,753
Even stars catch fire

906
00:34:05,953 --> 00:34:08,589
Watch us light up the sky

907
00:34:08,989 --> 00:34:11,192
Baby, dreams don’t expire

908
00:34:11,192 --> 00:34:13,594
So raise ‘em high

909
00:34:13,594 --> 00:34:14,795
Now whatchu know about?

910
00:34:14,829 --> 00:34:16,163
Big Reyna energy

911
00:34:16,497 --> 00:34:17,498
Big energy

912
00:34:17,531 --> 00:34:18,866
Big Reyna energy

913
00:34:19,266 --> 00:34:20,201
Big energy

914
00:34:20,234 --> 00:34:21,602
Big Reyna energy

915
00:34:21,969 --> 00:34:22,970
Big energy

916
00:34:23,003 --> 00:34:25,272
Who you think done put you on the map, babes?

917
00:34:25,272 --> 00:34:26,707
Missus it, I’m the one

918
00:34:26,774 --> 00:34:28,042
Viñas owns the crown

919
00:34:28,042 --> 00:34:29,410
Crowd of queens I’ll stand out

920
00:34:29,443 --> 00:34:30,644
No one brings me down

921
00:34:30,711 --> 00:34:32,113
Smart take, elevate

922
00:34:32,146 --> 00:34:33,514
Always out of the box

923
00:34:33,547 --> 00:34:34,882
Dared to dream, do the work

924
00:34:34,915 --> 00:34:36,617
And make it DeLuxe

925
00:34:36,684 --> 00:34:37,785
Lips were insecurity

926
00:34:37,785 --> 00:34:39,253
And now it is my trophy

927
00:34:39,253 --> 00:34:42,123
Showing versatility, being me my priority

928
00:34:42,123 --> 00:34:43,424
This is for my family

929
00:34:43,457 --> 00:34:44,758
Mom and Dad don’t you worry

930
00:34:44,792 --> 00:34:45,993
Future is secured with me

931
00:34:46,026 --> 00:34:47,895
My mouth is so pretty

932
00:34:47,895 --> 00:34:51,198
I don’t think you can handle this big Reyna energy

933
00:34:51,198 --> 00:34:52,299
Certainly not

934
00:34:52,333 --> 00:34:53,634
Yeah, cuz it’s high time

935
00:34:53,968 --> 00:34:54,635
High time

That you noticed it’s my time

Big vibes

938
00:34:57,438 --> 00:34:59,406
Every single time that I serve

939
00:34:59,473 --> 00:35:01,142
This hair and the face

940
00:35:01,175 --> 00:35:03,544
Who you think done put you on the map, babes?

941
00:35:03,577 --> 00:35:05,846
Even stars catch fire

942
00:35:06,113 --> 00:35:08,616
Watch us light up the sky

943
00:35:08,983 --> 00:35:11,185

So raise ‘em high

945
00:35:14,321 --> 00:35:16,757
‘Cause even stars catch fire

Watch us light up the sky

947
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:22,096
Baby dreams don’t expire

948
00:35:22,096 --> 00:35:23,564

00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,836
Up first, Suki Doll.

00:36:37,438 --> 00:36:39,607
She's a golden girl!

985
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:42,343
This award is represented by The Loved One.

986
00:36:42,343 --> 00:36:45,412
The Loved One is not only my name, Suki,

987
00:36:45,446 --> 00:36:47,982
but it is also my label, The Loved One.

988
00:36:47,982 --> 00:36:50,718
This golden dress represents my golden heart

989
00:36:50,751 --> 00:36:52,653
with this beautiful golden trophy

990
00:36:52,686 --> 00:36:54,521
that represents the same dress.

991
00:36:54,555 --> 00:36:58,592
Only Midas touches my skin.

992
00:36:59,526 --> 00:37:01,929
Any hole is gold.

993
00:37:01,929 --> 00:37:03,197
And in that case,

994
00:37:03,197 --> 00:37:05,199
hers is.

995
00:37:06,133 --> 00:37:08,802
Next, Arizona Brandy.

996
00:37:09,303 --> 00:37:12,706
Oh, she shows her range.

997
00:37:12,706 --> 00:37:14,508
O-range.

998
00:37:16,310 --> 00:37:18,545
For this Runway, I'm serving you

999
00:37:18,579 --> 00:37:21,015
the Spark of Joy Award.

1000
00:37:21,015 --> 00:37:23,117
That's the award I'm giving myself

1001
00:37:23,117 --> 00:37:26,687
because sometimes you just need a little bit of spark

1002
00:37:26,887 --> 00:37:29,823
inside you to be able to move forward.

1003
00:37:29,890 --> 00:37:32,726
I'm holding my trophy shaped as a wine glass because

1004
00:37:32,726 --> 00:37:35,195
I am celebrating this award.

1005
00:37:35,429 --> 00:37:36,163
Winner?

1006
00:37:36,196 --> 00:37:37,665
I don't even know her.

1007
00:37:40,367 --> 00:37:41,935
Oh wow. Is that Regine?
(Famous Filipina Singer)

1008
00:37:43,437 --> 00:37:45,105
Next up, Brigiding.

1009
00:37:46,707 --> 00:37:48,976
She would like to thank her family.

1010
00:37:49,009 --> 00:37:49,977
Oh, my God.

1011
00:37:49,977 --> 00:37:51,312
I'm walking down the Runway

1012
00:37:51,312 --> 00:37:53,681
serving Powder Blue Elegance,

1013
00:37:53,714 --> 00:37:56,650
channeling the spirit of silver screen goddesses,

1014
00:37:56,750 --> 00:38:00,187
This is what beautiful looks like in pictures, and in person.

1015
00:38:00,421 --> 00:38:02,923
She's so fucking blinding.

1016
00:38:02,956 --> 00:38:05,426
Fuck you, too, Mama Pao.

1017
00:38:05,426 --> 00:38:07,961
You are so blue-tiful!

1018
00:38:08,262 --> 00:38:10,064
Hella glowing!

1019
00:38:10,097 --> 00:38:11,365
Like Cinder-hella.

1020
00:38:14,301 --> 00:38:16,637
And finally, Viñas DeLuxe.

1021
00:38:17,404 --> 00:38:18,172
Oh, my God!

1022
00:38:18,172 --> 00:38:20,441
Shout out, my sisters!

1023
00:38:20,441 --> 00:38:23,777
(A Filipino song)

1024
00:38:23,811 --> 00:38:26,213
I'm wearing a National Mouth Costume

1025
00:38:26,213 --> 00:38:29,149
matching my National Mouth trophy

1026
00:38:29,149 --> 00:38:30,584
because I am what?

1027
00:38:30,617 --> 00:38:33,687
The National Mouth of the Philippines.

1028
00:38:33,954 --> 00:38:35,656
I stand out among all the bitches.

1029
00:38:35,656 --> 00:38:37,257
They all dressed up gorgeously,

1030
00:38:37,291 --> 00:38:38,392
while I'm here, already gorgeous,

1031
00:38:38,392 --> 00:38:40,761
and a campy queen at that!

1032
00:38:40,761 --> 00:38:43,263
Kiss! Kiss!

1033
00:38:44,865 --> 00:38:47,901
You're so delu-luscious!

1034
00:38:47,901 --> 00:38:50,471
Is she the next Pinoy Bibig Winner?
(Mouth)

1035
00:38:53,741 --> 00:38:55,209
Welcome, Queens.

1036
00:38:55,743 --> 00:38:58,145
Now, it's time for the judges' critiques.

1037
00:38:59,747 --> 00:39:01,415
First up, Suki Doll.

1038
00:39:02,316 --> 00:39:04,718
Hi, my polyglot queen.

1039
00:39:04,718 --> 00:39:05,986
Hi, Nymphia.

1040
00:39:06,253 --> 00:39:07,921
I definitely loved your lyrics.

1041
00:39:07,955 --> 00:39:11,225
It really shone through what your personality is.

1042
00:39:11,258 --> 00:39:12,493
I just wished

1043
00:39:12,493 --> 00:39:14,595
you had more connection with the camera.

1044
00:39:14,628 --> 00:39:17,464
I want you to make love to the camera, you know?

1045
00:39:17,564 --> 00:39:19,233
You could tell you were

1046
00:39:19,233 --> 00:39:20,634
a little bit in your head.

1047
00:39:20,634 --> 00:39:22,202
I was rooting for you. I was like,

1048
00:39:22,202 --> 00:39:25,272
“Come on, Suki Doll," 'cause like you were dressed so beautifully.

1049
00:39:25,272 --> 00:39:26,140
But

1050
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:29,243
I would say I commend you for your commitment

1051
00:39:29,243 --> 00:39:31,011
to your work and

1052
00:39:31,011 --> 00:39:33,947
making sure that you hit every mark.

1053
00:39:34,014 --> 00:39:36,583
And you look absolutely gorgeous today.

1054
00:39:36,617 --> 00:39:39,086
Love, love, love the Runway presentation.

1055
00:39:39,086 --> 00:39:42,890
From the mesh details to the printed fabric

1056
00:39:42,890 --> 00:39:45,526
to the corseted waistline.

1057
00:39:45,559 --> 00:39:49,930
Suki Doll, you showed us that you're not just about fashion and art.

1058
00:39:49,963 --> 00:39:53,333
You're also a doll with a golden heart.

1059
00:39:53,467 --> 00:39:55,335
And I thank you for being part

1060
00:39:55,335 --> 00:39:57,271
of this special season.

1061
00:39:57,271 --> 00:39:58,839
Thank you, Mama Pao.

1062
00:39:59,173 --> 00:40:01,875
Next up, Arizona Brandy.

1063
00:40:01,909 --> 00:40:03,143
Hi!

1064
00:40:03,677 --> 00:40:05,913
It just put a smile on my face watching you

1065
00:40:05,913 --> 00:40:07,748
perform in front of the camera.

1066
00:40:07,748 --> 00:40:10,651
You had a great connection and great charisma.

1067
00:40:10,684 --> 00:40:13,420
And the Runway is beautiful.

1068
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:17,324
Love, love, love that the gown matches your trophy.

1069
00:40:17,357 --> 00:40:18,525
And it's just like,

1070
00:40:18,559 --> 00:40:21,195
you just see your personality in your presentation of

1071
00:40:21,228 --> 00:40:21,762
the trophy.

1072
00:40:21,762 --> 00:40:23,630
It felt like, okay, maybe you love orange.

1073
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:24,898
Do you like orange?

1074
00:40:25,499 --> 00:40:26,467
Kinda. Kidding!

1075
00:40:26,467 --> 00:40:28,135
- Kinda?
- Yes, I really love—

1076
00:40:28,936 --> 00:40:31,104
I love orange so much.

1077
00:40:31,238 --> 00:40:35,042
I really, really love the way you wrote your lyrics.

1078
00:40:35,042 --> 00:40:39,379
How you changed the flow from rapping to singing.

1079
00:40:39,379 --> 00:40:41,315
It gives a little bit of...

1080
00:40:41,315 --> 00:40:42,382
Surprise.

1081
00:40:42,382 --> 00:40:44,885
And I think among everyone,

1082
00:40:44,918 --> 00:40:47,387
you were the one who really wrote down

1083
00:40:47,387 --> 00:40:50,224
what their journey has been, their evolution.

1084
00:40:50,224 --> 00:40:52,359
And I think that was the brief and you really hit

1085
00:40:52,359 --> 00:40:53,494
the nail on that one.

1086
00:40:53,527 --> 00:40:55,762
And you really glowed up from your season.

1087
00:40:55,762 --> 00:40:57,664
And I'm so, so proud to see you here.

1088
00:40:57,664 --> 00:40:59,867
Congratulations. What a strong night for you.

1089
00:41:00,133 --> 00:41:02,736
Hearing that is like music to my ears.

1090
00:41:04,071 --> 00:41:06,106
But yeah, no kidding.

1091
00:41:06,106 --> 00:41:09,142
My goal entering here,

1092
00:41:09,142 --> 00:41:13,480
I just wanted to feel beautiful for once.

1093
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:17,284
Like, I've never felt beautiful on our,

1094
00:41:17,317 --> 00:41:19,052
on my previous season.

1095
00:41:19,086 --> 00:41:23,190
And thank you for always reminding me

1096
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:25,192
now that I look beautiful.

1097
00:41:25,225 --> 00:41:28,896
You know, Arizona, you do not need us reminding you

1098
00:41:28,929 --> 00:41:30,764
or telling you that you're beautiful.

1099
00:41:30,898 --> 00:41:32,799
Because you are beautiful.

1100
00:41:32,866 --> 00:41:34,801
You don't need any rhinestones or

1101
00:41:34,835 --> 00:41:36,370
fancy clothes.

1102
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:38,405
It's how you feel inside.

1103
00:41:38,438 --> 00:41:40,607
What's important is in here.

1104
00:41:41,041 --> 00:41:43,210
- Thank you very much, Arizona Brandy.
- Thank you.

1105
00:41:43,243 --> 00:41:44,845
Next up, Brigiding.

1106
00:41:44,878 --> 00:41:46,580
Let's start with the music video.

1107
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:48,782
It was so beautiful watching you.

1108
00:41:48,815 --> 00:41:50,217
Your eye connection

1109
00:41:50,217 --> 00:41:52,319
to me was the best out of the group.

1110
00:41:52,352 --> 00:41:54,588
It just felt like you were making love to me.

1111
00:41:54,588 --> 00:41:56,456
Like, you looked so hot.

1112
00:41:56,490 --> 00:41:58,425
Really? Am I really that pretty?!

1113
00:41:59,226 --> 00:42:01,628
Okay, that sounded like a...

1114
00:42:01,962 --> 00:42:03,230
Okay, wait a minute.

1115
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:04,565
Shocks!

1116
00:42:05,499 --> 00:42:07,534
When we were filming the music video,

1117
00:42:07,534 --> 00:42:11,038
your energy from start to finish was just up there.

1118
00:42:11,038 --> 00:42:13,974
You were everywhere in all the good ways, you were

1119
00:42:13,974 --> 00:42:16,877
down on the floor, you were on the wall, you were

1120
00:42:16,877 --> 00:42:18,211
prancing down.

1121
00:42:18,245 --> 00:42:19,479
And I loved it.

1122
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:23,283
- Brigiding, Brigiding Ding Ding.
- Ding ding ding, Mama Pao!

1123
00:42:23,317 --> 00:42:25,052
As always, Brigiding.

1124
00:42:25,185 --> 00:42:29,222
The way you act, the way you present yourself on camera,

1125
00:42:29,256 --> 00:42:31,658
on stage is always professional.

1126
00:42:31,658 --> 00:42:33,026
So...

1127
00:42:33,026 --> 00:42:34,928
- Kudos to you, Brigiding.
- Thank you.

1128
00:42:34,928 --> 00:42:38,966
On the Runway tonight, you looked amazing.

1129
00:42:38,999 --> 00:42:40,734
I want to ask about your trophy.

1130
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:42,302
Could you tell us more about it?

1131
00:42:42,336 --> 00:42:46,139
My trophy is the “Kiki ng Ina” Award.
(Sparkling Mother)

1132
00:42:46,139 --> 00:42:48,609
It's a testament to myself.

1133
00:42:48,642 --> 00:42:52,613
From believing in that spark inside my heart

1134
00:42:52,646 --> 00:42:55,616
that I've been looking for the last few years,

1135
00:42:55,616 --> 00:42:58,085
and I finally found it and I was able to

1136
00:42:58,085 --> 00:43:00,754
share the spotlight with everyone around me.

1137
00:43:00,954 --> 00:43:04,224
Brigiding, you truly are a bright star and we can

1138
00:43:04,224 --> 00:43:06,627
see that shining through tonight.

1139
00:43:06,693 --> 00:43:08,862
I love how you presented the trophy,

1140
00:43:08,895 --> 00:43:10,330
how you walked on this Runway.

1141
00:43:10,330 --> 00:43:11,932
Your heart shone through

1142
00:43:11,932 --> 00:43:13,333
when you held that trophy.

1143
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:15,369
It's like the perfect marination

1144
00:43:15,369 --> 00:43:16,903
of your personality and the dress.

1145
00:43:16,903 --> 00:43:18,438
It was just
beautiful to watch.

1146
00:43:18,472 --> 00:43:20,407
- Thank you so much.
- Congratulations.

1147
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:23,710
Last but not the least, Viñas DeLuxe.

1148
00:43:23,710 --> 00:43:25,245
When I think of Viñas DeLuxe

1149
00:43:25,278 --> 00:43:28,815
This is exactly what I want to see on the Runway.

1150
00:43:28,815 --> 00:43:31,118
It's pure camp excellence.

1151
00:43:31,151 --> 00:43:34,354
It's not just a look, it's an entire performance.

1152
00:43:34,554 --> 00:43:36,690
And it represents your drag

1153
00:43:36,723 --> 00:43:39,726
and your branding a hundred percent.

1154
00:43:39,726 --> 00:43:41,862
All I want to know is,

1155
00:43:41,862 --> 00:43:44,464
is that a fleshlight in your trophy?

1156
00:43:44,665 --> 00:43:46,366
It's not just a fleshlight,

1157
00:43:46,366 --> 00:43:48,035
It's a used fleshlight. I'm kidding!

1158
00:43:48,035 --> 00:43:48,568
I'm kidding!

1159
00:43:49,636 --> 00:43:53,340
Tell us more about your very interesting trophy.

1160
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:55,942
So my trophy is

1161
00:43:55,976 --> 00:43:58,245
The National Mouth Award.

1162
00:43:58,311 --> 00:44:00,681
Actually, when I was a kid,

1163
00:44:01,348 --> 00:44:03,583
my nickname was "Saggy" because

1164
00:44:03,583 --> 00:44:06,253
my lips were saggy and

1165
00:44:06,386 --> 00:44:09,890
it became an insecurity to me for a long time.

1166
00:44:09,923 --> 00:44:12,292
And then when I accepted it, I

1167
00:44:12,325 --> 00:44:16,997
flourished and those insecurities are my strength now.

1168
00:44:16,997 --> 00:44:19,800
And it's the one that feeds my family.

1169
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:21,968
It's the one that I use to sing,

1170
00:44:21,968 --> 00:44:23,503
I use to lip sync,

1171
00:44:23,503 --> 00:44:25,272
I use to talk

1172
00:44:25,272 --> 00:44:26,206
shit.

1173
00:44:26,707 --> 00:44:28,675
One day, as long as you push through and

1174
00:44:28,675 --> 00:44:31,478
you learn to accept that you are enough,

1175
00:44:31,511 --> 00:44:32,979
that you are loved,

1176
00:44:32,979 --> 00:44:35,482
it will be your strength and

1177
00:44:35,582 --> 00:44:37,050
it can bring you to places.

1178
00:44:37,050 --> 00:44:39,419
And what a great use of your mouth.

1179
00:44:39,686 --> 00:44:42,055
I know yesterday when we were recording,

1180
00:44:42,089 --> 00:44:44,624
you were a little bit nervous but

1181
00:44:44,658 --> 00:44:47,227
I mean, you can't tell that when you hear the song.

1182
00:44:47,227 --> 00:44:48,628
When you danced the wrong moves,

1183
00:44:48,628 --> 00:44:50,864
I couldn't even tell because your personality just

1184
00:44:50,864 --> 00:44:52,065
covered it so well.

1185
00:44:52,232 --> 00:44:54,267
I was just mesmerized looking at you.

1186
00:44:54,267 --> 00:44:56,636
Your wit really goes a long way.

1187
00:44:56,636 --> 00:45:00,006
So congratulations, Viñas DeLuxe.

1188
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:01,441
Thank you.

1189
00:45:01,541 --> 00:45:03,043
Now, before I decide

1190
00:45:03,076 --> 00:45:07,013
who among you will move on to the grand finale of the very first

1191
00:45:07,047 --> 00:45:10,250
Drag Race Philippines: Slaysian Royale

1192
00:45:10,550 --> 00:45:13,553
I want to hear from you, Queens.

1193
00:45:13,587 --> 00:45:16,490
Why should you be the very first

1194
00:45:16,556 --> 00:45:19,559
Slaysian Royale Drag Superstar?

1195
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:21,094
Suki Doll.

1196
00:45:21,228 --> 00:45:24,698
I believe to be the Slaysian Royale's first winner,

1197
00:45:24,698 --> 00:45:27,901
it has to be represented by somebody who has

1198
00:45:27,934 --> 00:45:30,904
not only the virtues, the values to represent all of Asia,

1199
00:45:30,937 --> 00:45:32,639
but also the talent and the roundness

1200
00:45:32,672 --> 00:45:34,107
that is needed in the competition.

1201
00:45:34,107 --> 00:45:36,343
Obviously, in every step of the way,

1202
00:45:36,343 --> 00:45:38,478
we have all had our impediments and we have

1203
00:45:38,512 --> 00:45:39,813
tripped along the way.

1204
00:45:39,846 --> 00:45:42,949
But in any of those moments, I have been able to

1205
00:45:42,949 --> 00:45:45,485
surpass it and also continue with it.

1206
00:45:45,519 --> 00:45:48,855
I do represent myself as a winner of not only Slaysian Royale,

1207
00:45:48,889 --> 00:45:51,424
but of the drag art that I perform for myself,

1208
00:45:51,458 --> 00:45:53,326
and also that I represent on this platform.

1209
00:45:53,727 --> 00:45:55,328
Thank you, Mama Pao.

1210
00:45:55,328 --> 00:45:56,930
Arizona Brandy.

1211
00:45:57,564 --> 00:45:58,965
I've grown a lot.

1212
00:45:58,999 --> 00:46:00,567
I've shown that growth

1213
00:46:00,634 --> 00:46:02,869
all throughout my journey here.

1214
00:46:02,936 --> 00:46:04,871
I've shown them versatility.

1215
00:46:04,871 --> 00:46:06,239
I just don't want to win

1216
00:46:06,273 --> 00:46:07,841
just because I want to win.

1217
00:46:07,908 --> 00:46:09,676
Like I want to win this so that

1218
00:46:09,676 --> 00:46:11,478
I could inspire other people.

1219
00:46:11,478 --> 00:46:14,915
I could inspire local, Filipino drag queens like me.

1220
00:46:14,915 --> 00:46:16,249
And this time around,

1221
00:46:16,249 --> 00:46:18,718
I'm not just going to represent my drag family.

1222
00:46:18,752 --> 00:46:20,053
I want to represent

1223
00:46:20,053 --> 00:46:23,790
the whole local Filipino drag queens, and I hope

1224
00:46:23,824 --> 00:46:25,225
when they watch this,

1225
00:46:25,225 --> 00:46:28,195
they'll be proud and they'll be inspired because

1226
00:46:28,228 --> 00:46:31,364
they have all inspired me all throughout my journey here.

1227
00:46:31,464 --> 00:46:32,265
Thank you.

1228
00:46:32,599 --> 00:46:33,500
Brigiding.

1229
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,103
I think I should be the first Slaysian Royale winner

1230
00:46:38,238 --> 00:46:40,540
because through this show,

1231
00:46:41,141 --> 00:46:42,409
I believed in myself.

1232
00:46:42,442 --> 00:46:45,078
I've learned to accept my flaws.

1233
00:46:45,145 --> 00:46:47,214
I've learned to accept my journey.

1234
00:46:47,247 --> 00:46:50,517
And I want the whole world to see themselves in me.

1235
00:46:50,550 --> 00:46:51,852
They may be losing.

1236
00:46:51,885 --> 00:46:53,587
They may be heartbroken.

1237
00:46:53,587 --> 00:46:55,922
But soon, if they believe in themselves

1238
00:46:55,922 --> 00:46:59,793
and trust the process, everything will happen for a reason.

1239
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:02,128
And soon, they will be crowned

1240
00:47:02,128 --> 00:47:05,665
and represent Slaysian Royale to the world.

1241
00:47:05,699 --> 00:47:06,900
Viñas DeLuxe.

1242
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:09,436
I should win the Slaysian Royale because

1243
00:47:09,469 --> 00:47:12,205
I'm a great representation

1244
00:47:12,239 --> 00:47:15,342
of being celebrated for their flaws.

1245
00:47:15,375 --> 00:47:18,778
And I know I represent drag

1246
00:47:18,812 --> 00:47:20,780
of the Philippines very, very well.

1247
00:47:20,780 --> 00:47:22,582
I have the charisma.

1248
00:47:22,649 --> 00:47:24,684
I am very, very unique.

1249
00:47:24,718 --> 00:47:25,986
I am talented.

1250
00:47:25,986 --> 00:47:27,854
I sing, I dance, I act.

1251
00:47:27,854 --> 00:47:30,457
I did everything in this competition.

1252
00:47:30,457 --> 00:47:33,827
And I've proven myself that I can be on the top.

1253
00:47:33,860 --> 00:47:35,028
Thank you.

1254
00:47:36,296 --> 00:47:38,999
Queens, thank you for your openness

1255
00:47:38,999 --> 00:47:42,669
and for showing such fierce determination.

1256
00:47:43,703 --> 00:47:46,072
Now, while you untuck in the Werkroom,

1257
00:47:46,106 --> 00:47:48,375
the judges and I

1258
00:47:48,475 --> 00:47:50,510
will have a long,

1259
00:47:50,543 --> 00:47:52,379
long,

1260
00:47:52,445 --> 00:47:54,080
long

1261
00:47:54,114 --> 00:47:56,082
dinner break.

1262
00:47:56,149 --> 00:47:57,050
And then we come back

1263
00:47:57,050 --> 00:47:58,852
and deliberate for a bit, okay?

1264
00:47:59,452 --> 00:48:00,854
You may leave the stage

1265
00:48:00,921 --> 00:48:02,355
- and evaporate.
- Evaporate.

1266
00:48:02,355 --> 00:48:03,290
Thank you.

1267
00:48:09,562 --> 00:48:11,698
Cheers to the Top 4!

1268
00:48:11,698 --> 00:48:12,766
Oh my God!

1269
00:48:12,832 --> 00:48:14,267
Top 4 of Slaysian Royale!

1270
00:48:14,267 --> 00:48:16,436
Cheers!

1271
00:48:16,469 --> 00:48:18,471
I think whatever happens tonight,

1272
00:48:18,505 --> 00:48:19,472
I think no one should

1273
00:48:19,472 --> 00:48:20,907
feel defeated anymore

1274
00:48:20,907 --> 00:48:22,609
because we did all that.

1275
00:48:22,709 --> 00:48:25,011
Oh, my God!

1276
00:48:25,045 --> 00:48:27,480
Oh, my gosh!

1277
00:48:27,514 --> 00:48:29,683
Bottoms up, Top 4!

1278
00:48:30,116 --> 00:48:31,184
I truly believe that

1279
00:48:31,217 --> 00:48:32,152
the experience we had here

1280
00:48:32,152 --> 00:48:33,420
is worth more than 2 million

1281
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:35,422
This is a one in a lifetime experience

1282
00:48:35,455 --> 00:48:36,089
that we shared

1283
00:48:36,089 --> 00:48:37,157
and there's nothing

1284
00:48:37,190 --> 00:48:39,025
that we can compare even.

1285
00:48:39,059 --> 00:48:41,828
Since we've had awards,

1286
00:48:41,928 --> 00:48:44,130
what award would we give

1287
00:48:44,197 --> 00:48:46,833
- to our queens who went home?
- Left.

1288
00:48:46,866 --> 00:48:48,802
Let's start with Madame Yoko.

1289
00:48:48,835 --> 00:48:50,403
Best Porkchop ever.

1290
00:48:51,237 --> 00:48:52,839
The Slaysian Porkchop.

1291
00:48:52,839 --> 00:48:54,741
The Slaysian Porkchop!

1292
00:48:54,808 --> 00:48:57,444
You know why she's the best Porkchop?

1293
00:48:57,444 --> 00:48:57,877
- Because?
- Why?

1294
00:48:57,877 --> 00:48:59,045
Because before she entered,

1295
00:48:59,045 --> 00:49:00,313
she's already packed.

1296
00:49:03,149 --> 00:49:04,184
Right?

1297
00:49:04,317 --> 00:49:05,385
Who's the next one?

1298
00:49:05,418 --> 00:49:06,386
Sum Ting Wong.

1299
00:49:06,386 --> 00:49:07,687
Sum Ting!

1300
00:49:07,687 --> 00:49:08,888
- What's the award?
- Okay.

1301
00:49:08,888 --> 00:49:10,290
The award for Sum Ting,

1302
00:49:10,323 --> 00:49:11,291
you think you have the biggest mouth,

1303
00:49:11,324 --> 00:49:12,092
but actually she does.

1304
00:49:13,994 --> 00:49:15,061
She has the most to say

1305
00:49:15,061 --> 00:49:16,062
and honestly,

1306
00:49:16,096 --> 00:49:16,730
Yes.

1307
00:49:16,730 --> 00:49:17,664
yeah, she does.

1308
00:49:17,697 --> 00:49:18,999
Yuhua, the reason we changed

1309
00:49:18,999 --> 00:49:19,966
the choreo so many times

1310
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,334
is because you kept fucking it up.

1311
00:49:21,601 --> 00:49:22,936
But I think like Sum Ting Wong,

1312
00:49:22,936 --> 00:49:24,104
even though we know

1313
00:49:24,104 --> 00:49:25,872
she has like a big mouth.

1314
00:49:25,872 --> 00:49:27,941
She also has like a big heart.

1315
00:49:27,941 --> 00:49:28,842
Yeah.

1316
00:49:28,842 --> 00:49:30,243
- She cares so much for
- She does.

1317
00:49:30,243 --> 00:49:32,212
- the whole international queens.
- She did.

1318
00:49:32,212 --> 00:49:33,013
What about Ivory Glaze?

1319
00:49:33,046 --> 00:49:33,646
Ivory.

1320
00:49:33,646 --> 00:49:35,115
Aww, Most Cute.

1321
00:49:35,148 --> 00:49:36,349
Kidding!

1322
00:49:36,349 --> 00:49:38,952
She's the “Most Shady” queen.

1323
00:49:38,952 --> 00:49:39,552
Is she shady?

1324
00:49:39,552 --> 00:49:41,388
- Didn't you notice?
- Yeah, she's shady but

1325
00:49:41,421 --> 00:49:42,489
you know, like she's

1326
00:49:42,489 --> 00:49:44,391
- She's so shady but you can't-
- Ooh.

1327
00:49:46,259 --> 00:49:46,860
Pass.

1328
00:49:48,228 --> 00:49:49,596
Okay, next.

1329
00:49:49,596 --> 00:49:50,530
- Next.
- Kitt-

1330
00:49:50,730 --> 00:49:51,698
Let's do fast round.

1331
00:49:51,731 --> 00:49:53,333
The first thing you have in mind.

1332
00:49:53,366 --> 00:49:53,733
For who?

1333
00:49:53,767 --> 00:49:55,135
Kitty Space.

1334
00:49:55,135 --> 00:49:55,635
Okay.

1335
00:49:55,668 --> 00:49:57,137
One, two, three, go.

1336
00:49:57,203 --> 00:49:58,605
- Best...
- Most CAT.

1337
00:50:01,841 --> 00:50:03,743
C is for very caring.

1338
00:50:06,112 --> 00:50:08,281
A is for she's very alluring.

1339
00:50:08,815 --> 00:50:10,250
Alluring?!

1340
00:50:10,250 --> 00:50:11,751
And T is for her-

1341
00:50:11,818 --> 00:50:13,319
she's very tenacious.

1342
00:50:13,486 --> 00:50:15,922
Tenacious?!

1343
00:50:15,922 --> 00:50:17,123
She is tenacious.

1344
00:50:17,123 --> 00:50:19,092
Like, when I see her, she's

1345
00:50:19,192 --> 00:50:21,127
such a hardworking queen.

1346
00:50:21,161 --> 00:50:21,828
- True.
- She is.

1347
00:50:21,828 --> 00:50:22,529
Okay, next.

1348
00:50:23,229 --> 00:50:24,030
Kitty Space.

1349
00:50:24,030 --> 00:50:24,597
Bernie.

1350
00:50:24,597 --> 00:50:26,299
Oh, my God, Bernie!

1351
00:50:26,299 --> 00:50:27,734
The Biggest Heart Award.

1352
00:50:27,834 --> 00:50:28,568
Because, you know,

1353
00:50:28,568 --> 00:50:29,836
we were sitting next to each other

1354
00:50:29,836 --> 00:50:30,804
and she was always the one

1355
00:50:30,837 --> 00:50:31,771
trying to help me,

1356
00:50:31,771 --> 00:50:32,572
trying to make me understand

1357
00:50:32,572 --> 00:50:33,540
the conversations.

1358
00:50:33,807 --> 00:50:35,608
- To be honest,
- She's teaching you.

1359
00:50:35,642 --> 00:50:36,676
she was always teaching me.

1360
00:50:36,676 --> 00:50:38,578
- That's a crazy body, girl.
- Okay, next is,

1361
00:50:38,645 --> 00:50:40,814
Siam!

1362
00:50:40,814 --> 00:50:41,948
The Spirit Award.

1363
00:50:41,948 --> 00:50:42,849
Spirit Award.

1364
00:50:42,849 --> 00:50:43,650
Okay, next.

1365
00:50:44,284 --> 00:50:45,518
Stop chanting.

1366
00:50:46,686 --> 00:50:47,754
I'm safe,

1367
00:50:48,054 --> 00:50:49,322
I'm safe,

1368
00:50:49,322 --> 00:50:50,223
- and you,
- Shh! Shh!

1369
00:50:50,223 --> 00:50:51,424
Shh.

1370
00:50:51,424 --> 00:50:52,592
- please love me.
- Shh.

1371
00:50:52,592 --> 00:50:53,793
Stop chanting.

1372
00:50:54,394 --> 00:50:56,296
“Charing!” I said stop charing.

1373
00:50:56,296 --> 00:50:57,063
That was “kidding.”

1374
00:50:57,097 --> 00:50:59,866
Kidding!

1375
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:02,402
Yuhua!

1376
00:51:02,402 --> 00:51:04,170
Okay, Ugliest Wig Award.

1377
00:51:06,973 --> 00:51:09,642
We love that ugly wig of her.

1378
00:51:09,676 --> 00:51:10,143
Do we?

1379
00:51:10,443 --> 00:51:11,544
No, I do.

1380
00:51:11,611 --> 00:51:12,479
Yes, it's iconic.

1381
00:51:12,479 --> 00:51:13,913
I just love Yuhua.

1382
00:51:13,913 --> 00:51:15,248
I love Yuhua.

1383
00:51:15,248 --> 00:51:16,916
I love her.

1384
00:51:16,950 --> 00:51:18,184
I love her the most.

1385
00:51:19,419 --> 00:51:20,753
Okay, who's next?

1386
00:51:21,621 --> 00:51:22,589
Khianna?

1387
00:51:22,989 --> 00:51:25,125
Khianna!

1388
00:51:25,125 --> 00:51:26,559
The K Award.

1389
00:51:26,993 --> 00:51:28,161
The Most K Award.

1390
00:51:28,194 --> 00:51:30,830
Khianna with a K!

1391
00:51:30,864 --> 00:51:33,099
Khianna is the El Tocuyo Award.

1392
00:51:33,166 --> 00:51:34,634
What's El Tocuyo?

1393
00:51:34,634 --> 00:51:35,835
Nobody got the reference?

1394
00:51:35,902 --> 00:51:37,036
Nevermind.

1395
00:51:38,605 --> 00:51:41,975
- Oh, my God!
- You girls are here still here!

1396
00:51:42,075 --> 00:51:44,477
The Queens! The icons!

1397
00:51:44,544 --> 00:51:46,746
Not our sisters joining us back.

1398
00:51:46,779 --> 00:51:48,648
They look so good,

1399
00:51:48,681 --> 00:51:49,816
but I look better.

1400
00:51:51,751 --> 00:51:53,353
- Hello! Hi, I'm here.
- Sit down here!

1401
00:51:56,756 --> 00:52:00,994
Let's make a toast for the Top 4! Cheers!

1402
00:52:01,294 --> 00:52:03,396
Before they entered, it was just so light.

1403
00:52:03,429 --> 00:52:06,699
And then when they entered, it was so heavy. Kidding.

1404
00:52:06,766 --> 00:52:08,434
Because there's a lot of us now.

1405
00:52:08,501 --> 00:52:10,937
How are you, girls?

1406
00:52:10,970 --> 00:52:14,107
- How are you?
- Very good, yeah.

1407
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:15,742
Are you okay?

1408
00:52:15,775 --> 00:52:17,844
Yes yes, yes. I'm so happy about

1409
00:52:17,844 --> 00:52:20,146
this whole experience because

1410
00:52:20,246 --> 00:52:24,217
I'm rediscovering myself, and I'm so happy that

1411
00:52:24,250 --> 00:52:28,421
I've shown every side of me, from being top,

1412
00:52:28,421 --> 00:52:31,858
bottom, nervous, happy, confident, whatever.

1413
00:52:31,858 --> 00:52:33,259
So Brigiding, how are you?

1414
00:52:33,259 --> 00:52:34,761
You have so many jewels!

1415
00:52:34,761 --> 00:52:37,297
Why don't you pawn one off to Katkat?

1416
00:52:37,330 --> 00:52:40,733
You're over-accessorized, it's better if you...

1417
00:52:40,767 --> 00:52:44,003
Seriously, it looks better without the necklace.

1418
00:52:44,003 --> 00:52:44,771
Look.

1419
00:52:44,771 --> 00:52:45,505
Check her hands.

1420
00:52:45,505 --> 00:52:47,207
I'm starting to get fucking worried about this!

1421
00:52:47,207 --> 00:52:50,109
- Those earrings, you should really remove them.
- You just really have to go for the expensive ones, huh?

1422
00:52:50,276 --> 00:52:51,711
That's expensive, girl!

1423
00:52:51,911 --> 00:52:54,781
There's just too much accessories.

1424
00:52:54,781 --> 00:52:56,549
- I knew it.
- How about the ring?

1425
00:52:56,849 --> 00:52:59,552
I was right all along.

1426
00:52:59,552 --> 00:53:01,721
It really suits better without...

1427
00:53:01,888 --> 00:53:03,189
You don't have to pull it off!

1428
00:53:03,223 --> 00:53:04,490
I can't see it well!

1429
00:53:04,524 --> 00:53:07,026
I need the 2 million even more now.

1430
00:53:07,026 --> 00:53:09,329
So I can get these back.

1431
00:53:09,329 --> 00:53:14,000
I'm really going to pawn these in the pawnshop near us.

1432
00:53:14,734 --> 00:53:17,003
So many stars! There's two.

1433
00:53:17,003 --> 00:53:20,473
- Just like your RuBadge, you have two!
- Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1434
00:53:20,473 --> 00:53:22,675
Who do you think will get the third RuBadge?

1435
00:53:22,709 --> 00:53:25,245
Who do you think will get the last RuBadge?

1436
00:53:25,278 --> 00:53:27,847
I mean, some of the other girls did so amazing.

1437
00:53:27,847 --> 00:53:30,650
And obviously, I only got to see the girls in the group,

1438
00:53:30,683 --> 00:53:32,518
but Viñas, you were so amazing.

1439
00:53:32,518 --> 00:53:35,288
Your vocals were amazing, your dance performance was amazing.

1440
00:53:35,288 --> 00:53:36,556
Brigs also was the same.

1441
00:53:36,589 --> 00:53:37,690
You were the same, obviously.

1442
00:53:37,724 --> 00:53:40,026
This is why, you know, this is the Top 4.

1443
00:53:40,093 --> 00:53:41,894
But in my heart right now,

1444
00:53:41,894 --> 00:53:44,197
it's balancing for, you know,

1445
00:53:44,197 --> 00:53:47,934
the crush that I have, Brigs!

1446
00:53:47,967 --> 00:53:48,635
Thank you!

1447
00:53:48,801 --> 00:53:51,271
Kiss! Kiss!

1448
00:53:51,271 --> 00:53:53,072
Kiss again?

1449
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:56,109
- Oh, you kissed already?
- You kissed?

1450
00:53:56,109 --> 00:53:57,343
Did you kiss?

1451
00:53:58,311 --> 00:53:59,345
Oh, shit!

1452
00:53:59,379 --> 00:54:01,948
You made Maxie mad now.

1453
00:54:01,948 --> 00:54:04,117
Did you kiss?

1454
00:54:04,150 --> 00:54:05,118
Why did you kiss?

1455
00:54:05,118 --> 00:54:07,754
I think, Maxie, actually, I think what the fans want

1456
00:54:07,787 --> 00:54:08,821
is the three-way kiss.

1457
00:54:10,657 --> 00:54:12,892
Don't you challenge Maxie.

1458
00:54:14,394 --> 00:54:16,129
Kiss!

1459
00:54:16,129 --> 00:54:17,030
Kiss!

1460
00:54:17,030 --> 00:54:17,864
Kiss!

1461
00:54:17,864 --> 00:54:20,033
- Oh, my God, is this happening?
- No! Shh. Shh.

1462
00:54:20,066 --> 00:54:20,667
Silence!

1463
00:54:20,667 --> 00:54:21,668
So noisy.

1464
00:54:22,735 --> 00:54:24,671
My other love team is out.

1465
00:54:25,104 --> 00:54:27,373
Though my other chance is here.

1466
00:54:28,207 --> 00:54:29,776
- I love you. Love you.
- Brianna.

1467
00:54:31,377 --> 00:54:32,979
I meant Brixie! Brixie.

1468
00:54:33,479 --> 00:54:34,213
Brixie, indeed.

1469
00:54:35,381 --> 00:54:37,917
Khianna, sorry. I told you so.

1470
00:54:37,950 --> 00:54:39,852
House of Ding will win this.

1471
00:54:42,288 --> 00:54:43,790
Can I just share this?

1472
00:54:43,790 --> 00:54:44,824
I just want to say

1473
00:54:44,824 --> 00:54:46,526
I'm so proud of Arizona.

1474
00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:49,295
- coming from our season,
- Kiss!

1475
00:54:49,295 --> 00:54:51,030
you've grown so much

1476
00:54:51,064 --> 00:54:53,866
and I'm so so proud of you

1477
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:56,803
for representing our season

1478
00:54:56,869 --> 00:54:58,104
so well.

1479
00:54:58,171 --> 00:54:59,939
I'm sure our Season 2 sisters

1480
00:55:00,006 --> 00:55:01,507
are so proud of you

1481
00:55:01,507 --> 00:55:03,242
and rooting for you also.

1482
00:55:04,310 --> 00:55:06,612
Brigiding, I've seen you

1483
00:55:06,612 --> 00:55:07,580
up front,

1484
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:09,248
close, in person.

1485
00:55:09,248 --> 00:55:11,250
Your journey from Season 1,

1486
00:55:11,250 --> 00:55:12,485
even after Season 1,

1487
00:55:12,485 --> 00:55:13,820
until now is just

1488
00:55:13,853 --> 00:55:15,154
so amazing to see.

1489
00:55:15,154 --> 00:55:17,390
So I'm really really happy that you're here.

1490
00:55:17,423 --> 00:55:20,760
Suki Doll, I have admired you from afar.

1491
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:22,562
We've met a couple of times

1492
00:55:22,595 --> 00:55:23,796
in Drag Con, and I'm-

1493
00:55:23,830 --> 00:55:26,065
To be able to see you here is just amazing

1494
00:55:26,065 --> 00:55:28,234
because you represent Canada so much

1495
00:55:28,234 --> 00:55:29,902
as you represent Asia.

1496
00:55:30,002 --> 00:55:31,003
You're multicultural

1497
00:55:31,003 --> 00:55:32,171
and I'm really, really happy that

1498
00:55:32,171 --> 00:55:33,373
you add such a

1499
00:55:33,406 --> 00:55:34,507
different flavor

1500
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:35,241
to this cast.

1501
00:55:35,241 --> 00:55:36,809
And Viñas, you are

1502
00:55:36,876 --> 00:55:39,812
a ball of talent and joy.

1503
00:55:39,879 --> 00:55:41,614
And I am sure that

1504
00:55:41,681 --> 00:55:43,383
everyone on this cast

1505
00:55:43,449 --> 00:55:45,385
saw that and the entire world

1506
00:55:45,451 --> 00:55:46,219
will see it.

1507
00:55:46,252 --> 00:55:48,054
So please, please

1508
00:55:48,154 --> 00:55:49,722
keep inspiring a lot of

1509
00:55:49,756 --> 00:55:51,023
Asian queens out there

1510
00:55:51,023 --> 00:55:51,991
because you represent

1511
00:55:51,991 --> 00:55:53,493
the best of the best.

1512
00:55:53,559 --> 00:55:55,161
And we are so honored to be

1513
00:55:55,228 --> 00:55:56,496
seated beside you all.

1514
00:55:56,562 --> 00:55:59,098
My Season 1 sister, Marina Summers.

1515
00:55:59,132 --> 00:56:01,100
I haven't spoken to Marina

1516
00:56:01,134 --> 00:56:02,735
for the past

1517
00:56:02,969 --> 00:56:04,070
four years.

1518
00:56:04,137 --> 00:56:04,971
This was our first meeting

1519
00:56:04,971 --> 00:56:06,139
in a long time.

1520
00:56:06,272 --> 00:56:08,141
I love seeing her.

1521
00:56:08,174 --> 00:56:10,243
I know she's a great queen and

1522
00:56:10,243 --> 00:56:13,479
she deserves to be in the position she's in now.

1523
00:56:13,546 --> 00:56:15,047
And can I just say,

1524
00:56:15,515 --> 00:56:16,849
as the youngest queen here

1525
00:56:16,849 --> 00:56:18,651
inside the Werkroom,

1526
00:56:19,051 --> 00:56:20,153
I just want to say

1527
00:56:20,186 --> 00:56:21,287
that you girls

1528
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:23,523
inspired me so much.

1529
00:56:23,556 --> 00:56:24,757
I can see that you're

1530
00:56:24,791 --> 00:56:26,192
performing from your heart.

1531
00:56:26,225 --> 00:56:27,593
And that's what most,

1532
00:56:27,627 --> 00:56:29,128
that's, what—

1533
00:56:29,262 --> 00:56:29,862
Pass!

1534
00:56:30,963 --> 00:56:33,433
But yeah, I'm so proud of you.

1535
00:56:33,466 --> 00:56:34,600
Please, please,

1536
00:56:34,634 --> 00:56:36,903
we only have one last chance

1537
00:56:36,903 --> 00:56:38,337
before you go to the finale

1538
00:56:38,337 --> 00:56:40,573
so please, enjoy the moment.

1539
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:42,408
Again, and...

1540
00:56:42,742 --> 00:56:43,443
I just want to say

1541
00:56:43,443 --> 00:56:45,077
that I love you girls so much.

1542
00:56:45,278 --> 00:56:48,214
I'm so happy that they are there.

1543
00:56:48,281 --> 00:56:50,716
I really feel that all throughout this week

1544
00:56:50,716 --> 00:56:52,185
that they're with us,

1545
00:56:52,251 --> 00:56:53,920
they were our older sisters.

1546
00:56:53,953 --> 00:56:55,221
REYN4s.

1547
00:56:55,721 --> 00:56:57,490
Time to leave, REYN4s.

1548
00:56:57,523 --> 00:56:58,791
Let's go, REYN4s.

1549
00:56:58,791 --> 00:56:59,992
She's wearing heels.

1550
00:57:00,193 --> 00:57:01,160
Okay, one more cheers

1551
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:03,629
for Asian excellence, everybody!

1552
00:57:03,629 --> 00:57:05,498
Congratulations!

1553
00:57:07,467 --> 00:57:09,001
Can I borrow it for a while?

1554
00:57:09,068 --> 00:57:10,603
Wait! Let me use it.

1555
00:57:10,636 --> 00:57:12,171
All the times you were here

1556
00:57:12,238 --> 00:57:13,406
I got nervous.

1557
00:57:13,873 --> 00:57:16,175
You're such a jerk. Can you just go home?

1558
00:57:16,175 --> 00:57:17,376
Love you.

1559
00:57:17,443 --> 00:57:18,444
You smell so nice.

1560
00:57:18,444 --> 00:57:21,180
So that's what a winner smells like.

1561
00:57:21,347 --> 00:57:22,715
Good luck, girls!

1562
00:57:22,715 --> 00:57:24,083
Bye!

1563
00:57:24,116 --> 00:57:25,351
Okay, Top 4.

1564
00:57:25,351 --> 00:57:26,052
Yes?

1565
00:57:26,052 --> 00:57:27,019
You have ten minutes

1566
00:57:27,019 --> 00:57:28,421
to rehearse your lip sync song.

1567
00:57:28,421 --> 00:57:29,755
Wow!

1568
00:57:29,789 --> 00:57:31,023
Can you show us a sample

1569
00:57:31,023 --> 00:57:32,225
of the lip sync song?

1570
00:57:33,526 --> 00:57:35,361
Bye!

1571
00:57:35,461 --> 00:57:37,396
It just sinked in that

1572
00:57:37,497 --> 00:57:38,464
a lot can still happen,

1573
00:57:38,464 --> 00:57:40,466
and the fight is not yet over.

1574
00:57:41,467 --> 00:57:42,635
I'm still nervous, of course.

1575
00:57:42,668 --> 00:57:43,936
Like I said...

1576
00:57:45,771 --> 00:57:47,907
Alright, just between us super judges,

1577
00:57:47,907 --> 00:57:49,041
what did you think?

1578
00:57:49,141 --> 00:57:50,743
First up, Suki Doll.

1579
00:57:50,776 --> 00:57:52,512
Great fashion for sure,

1580
00:57:52,545 --> 00:57:54,280
but I feel like she's definitely a queen

1581
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:55,915
with a lot of room to grow,

1582
00:57:55,948 --> 00:57:58,117
but she's also very willing to grow.

1583
00:57:58,150 --> 00:57:59,685
For Arizona Brandy.

1584
00:58:00,052 --> 00:58:02,555
Arizona is such a joy to watch,

1585
00:58:02,622 --> 00:58:06,292
and also you can feel the heart and passion

1586
00:58:06,392 --> 00:58:07,693
in everything that she says,

1587
00:58:07,693 --> 00:58:09,028
in everything that she does.

1588
00:58:09,095 --> 00:58:10,863
Arizona tonight is very, very strong.

1589
00:58:10,930 --> 00:58:11,964
For Brigiding.

1590
00:58:12,064 --> 00:58:14,100
Brigiding is a true professional.

1591
00:58:14,133 --> 00:58:15,701
She shows up for the job

1592
00:58:15,701 --> 00:58:17,737
and gets the job done.

1593
00:58:17,770 --> 00:58:19,605
Very strong night for her as well.

1594
00:58:20,006 --> 00:58:21,707
For Viñas DeLuxe.

1595
00:58:21,741 --> 00:58:24,043
Even though you could tell in the music video she was

1596
00:58:24,043 --> 00:58:27,046
a little, little, little bit nervous at some points,

1597
00:58:27,079 --> 00:58:29,815
but like her personality was just so fun.

1598
00:58:29,916 --> 00:58:32,018
Everything that she does is just so funny.

1599
00:58:32,051 --> 00:58:33,719
And that trophy, oh, my God.

1600
00:58:33,753 --> 00:58:35,821
That trophy is brilliant.

1601
00:58:35,821 --> 00:58:37,323
- So funny.
- Really stood out.

1602
00:58:38,224 --> 00:58:39,559
Nymphia, Marina,

1603
00:58:39,825 --> 00:58:41,427
I don't know what to do.

1604
00:58:41,794 --> 00:58:43,062
These 4 Slaysian Queens

1605
00:58:43,062 --> 00:58:44,964
are bringing it so hard.

1606
00:58:45,031 --> 00:58:46,732
I mean,

1607
00:58:46,832 --> 00:58:48,734
how do you even begin to choose

1608
00:58:48,768 --> 00:58:50,603
who goes home?

1609
00:58:52,171 --> 00:58:54,173
Welcome back, Queens.

1610
00:58:54,206 --> 00:58:56,075
We have made some decisions.

1611
00:58:56,142 --> 00:58:59,712
Who among you will be part of the finale?

1612
00:59:03,783 --> 00:59:05,551
Brigiding.

1613
00:59:07,853 --> 00:59:09,655
Condragulations.

1614
00:59:09,722 --> 00:59:13,225
You are the winner of this week's challenge.

1615
00:59:15,094 --> 00:59:17,797
This is insane. I was really not expecting this.

1616
00:59:19,165 --> 00:59:21,500
You have won a cash tip of 80,000 pesos

1617
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:23,069
courtesy of Cream Silk,

1618
00:59:23,102 --> 00:59:25,738
the number one hair care brand in the Philippines.

1619
00:59:25,771 --> 00:59:27,773
Oh, my God, for real Mama Pao?

1620
00:59:28,441 --> 00:59:29,508
You will also receive

1621
00:59:29,575 --> 00:59:32,311
the last Slaysian RuBadge of the season.

1622
00:59:32,411 --> 00:59:33,813
Give her a RuBadge!

1623
00:59:33,813 --> 00:59:34,880
Oh, my God!

1624
00:59:36,082 --> 00:59:37,917
- Wear it with Slaysian pride.
- Thank you.

1625
00:59:37,984 --> 00:59:39,385
You are going to be the first

1626
00:59:39,418 --> 00:59:42,588
finalist in the grand finale next week, Brigiding!

1627
00:59:42,622 --> 00:59:43,923
Shit, this is real.

1628
00:59:43,956 --> 00:59:44,657
Fuck!

1629
00:59:44,690 --> 00:59:45,992
Me, Brigiding,

1630
00:59:46,025 --> 00:59:46,993
from Season 1

1631
00:59:46,993 --> 00:59:49,795
who always lip synced for her life?

1632
00:59:50,029 --> 00:59:51,664
I have 3 RuBadges,

1633
00:59:51,697 --> 00:59:53,432
never lip synced for my life,

1634
00:59:53,499 --> 00:59:57,503
and can win Drag Race Slaysian Royale?

1635
00:59:58,204 --> 01:00:00,840
I'm going to the finale for real!

1636
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:02,141
What?

1637
01:00:03,843 --> 01:00:05,611
Thank you so much, Mama Pao.

1638
01:00:05,745 --> 01:00:07,947
You may go to the back of the stage.

1639
01:00:12,685 --> 01:00:14,887
Arizona Brandy.

1640
01:00:16,389 --> 01:00:17,957
Condragulations.

1641
01:00:17,990 --> 01:00:19,158
You're the second finalist

1642
01:00:19,191 --> 01:00:21,227
to be part of the grand finale.

1643
01:00:21,460 --> 01:00:23,029
Yeah, I'm in the finale!

1644
01:00:23,029 --> 01:00:24,263
Oh, my God!

1645
01:00:24,296 --> 01:00:25,931
Okay, thank you Mama Pao.

1646
01:00:25,931 --> 01:00:27,400
Thank you, everyone.

1647
01:00:27,533 --> 01:00:28,467
I'm going to show

1648
01:00:28,501 --> 01:00:31,270
why I deserve this spot again

1649
01:00:31,537 --> 01:00:32,705
on the finale.

1650
01:00:32,738 --> 01:00:34,073
Thank you.

1651
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:36,909
You may join Brigiding at the back.

1652
01:00:38,744 --> 01:00:39,812
Congrats.

1653
01:00:39,845 --> 01:00:40,980
That means Suki Doll

1654
01:00:40,980 --> 01:00:43,883
and Viñas DeLuxe, I'm sorry.

1655
01:00:44,450 --> 01:00:46,919
But you two are the Bottom queens this week.

1656
01:00:46,986 --> 01:00:49,121
I knew that I'd be in the bottom.

1657
01:00:49,155 --> 01:00:50,389
I felt it.

1658
01:00:50,423 --> 01:00:52,458
I'm not going to pretend I don't know.

1659
01:00:52,458 --> 01:00:53,526
Because

1660
01:00:53,526 --> 01:00:54,760
they were super happy

1661
01:00:54,794 --> 01:00:55,594
with their performances

1662
01:00:55,594 --> 01:00:56,962
while I was not so happy with mine.

1663
01:00:56,962 --> 01:00:57,863
Viñas.

1664
01:00:57,897 --> 01:00:59,231
She is so iconic.

1665
01:00:59,265 --> 01:01:01,901
I am feeling all the feels.

1666
01:01:02,201 --> 01:01:04,570
Two queens stand before me.

1667
01:01:05,638 --> 01:01:06,372
Prior to tonight,

1668
01:01:06,405 --> 01:01:07,406
you were asked to prepare

1669
01:01:07,406 --> 01:01:08,841
a lip sync performance of

1670
01:01:08,874 --> 01:01:10,876
“Power” by Morissette.

1671
01:01:11,377 --> 01:01:14,146
Ladies, this is your last chance to impress me.

1672
01:01:14,246 --> 01:01:17,683
And secure your place in the grand finale.

1673
01:01:18,784 --> 01:01:21,153
The time has come

1674
01:01:23,422 --> 01:01:25,725
for you to Lip Sync

1675
01:01:26,292 --> 01:01:28,227
for your Life.

1676
01:01:29,161 --> 01:01:32,498
Viñas, this is a song made for Suki.

1677
01:01:32,565 --> 01:01:33,399
I love you,

1678
01:01:33,399 --> 01:01:36,235
but I will powerhouse it down.

1679
01:01:36,435 --> 01:01:38,237
This is the first time we're using a slow song, so

1680
01:01:38,304 --> 01:01:41,006
this is a good chance to show the variety

1681
01:01:41,006 --> 01:01:43,943
and the capabilities of Vinas DeLuxe.

1682
01:01:44,043 --> 01:01:45,845
Queens, I want to see you fight

1683
01:01:45,911 --> 01:01:47,913
and pour your heart out.

1684
01:01:47,980 --> 01:01:50,816
Good luck, Queens, and don't fuck it up.

1685
01:02:02,027 --> 01:02:03,863
I've got today

1686
01:02:04,597 --> 01:02:07,133
I'm gonna break it

1687
01:02:07,133 --> 01:02:10,803
I'm gonna make it mine

1688
01:02:12,104 --> 01:02:14,573
This voice inside

1689
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:17,143
Now you can hear it

1690
01:02:17,209 --> 01:02:21,413
I know the choice is mine

1691
01:02:21,614 --> 01:02:26,418
I got this fire burning inside

1692
01:02:26,585 --> 01:02:32,658
You're gonna see me shine the light

1693
01:02:32,758 --> 01:02:35,094
I got wings to fly

1694
01:02:35,361 --> 01:02:37,663
To fly so high

1695
01:02:38,063 --> 01:02:40,132
I am a woman

1696
01:02:40,366 --> 01:02:42,768
And I got the power

1697
01:02:42,802 --> 01:02:45,137
I got more to give

1698
01:02:45,204 --> 01:02:47,807
The love that you need

1699
01:02:48,073 --> 01:02:50,242
I am a woman

1700
01:02:50,509 --> 01:02:54,547
And I got the power

1701
01:02:54,580 --> 01:02:58,017
Fly

1702
01:02:58,184 --> 01:03:00,352
I am a woman

1703
01:03:00,586 --> 01:03:04,356
And I got the power

1704
01:03:04,390 --> 01:03:08,294
Fly

1705
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:10,462
I am a woman

1706
01:03:10,696 --> 01:03:14,867
And I got the power

1707
01:03:14,900 --> 01:03:17,503
I'm gonna take you all by storm

1708
01:03:17,636 --> 01:03:19,738
I got the best of both worlds

1709
01:03:20,039 --> 01:03:22,241
I am a woman

1710
01:03:22,508 --> 01:03:28,113
You know that I got wings to fly so high, so high

1711
01:03:28,514 --> 01:03:33,152
I've got hands to touch the sky, the sky

1712
01:03:33,252 --> 01:03:35,754
I got more to give

1713
01:03:35,788 --> 01:03:38,557
The love that you need

1714
01:03:38,657 --> 01:03:40,659
I am a woman

1715
01:03:40,993 --> 01:03:46,198
And I got the power

1716
01:03:46,232 --> 01:03:48,534
To fly so high

1717
01:03:48,734 --> 01:03:50,936
I am a woman

1718
01:03:51,170 --> 01:03:53,472
And I got the power

1719
01:03:53,505 --> 01:03:55,808
I got more to give

1720
01:03:56,008 --> 01:03:58,677
The love that you need

1721
01:03:58,811 --> 01:04:00,980
I am a woman

1722
01:04:01,046 --> 01:04:04,383
Yes, I got the power

1723
01:04:04,383 --> 01:04:06,252
I got wings to fly

1724
01:04:06,252 --> 01:04:08,721
To fly so high

1725
01:04:08,954 --> 01:04:11,123
I am a woman

1726
01:04:11,357 --> 01:04:13,993
And I got the power

1727
01:04:14,026 --> 01:04:16,161
I got more to give

1728
01:04:16,228 --> 01:04:18,964
The love that you need

1729
01:04:19,098 --> 01:04:21,333
I am a woman

1730
01:04:21,367 --> 01:04:24,103
Yes, I got the power

1731
01:04:40,653 --> 01:04:41,754
Wow.

1732
01:04:44,390 --> 01:04:47,259
Ladies, I have made my decision.

1733
01:04:49,428 --> 01:04:51,730
Viñas DeLuxe.

1734
01:04:54,133 --> 01:04:56,068
Shantay, you stay.

1735
01:04:57,036 --> 01:04:59,772
If I wasn't gonna be in the finals

1736
01:04:59,772 --> 01:05:00,673
because of that song,

1737
01:05:00,673 --> 01:05:02,408
I would've quit drag, literally.

1738
01:05:03,409 --> 01:05:04,710
Thank you, Mama Pao,

1739
01:05:04,743 --> 01:05:07,980
that you saw the fire in me.

1740
01:05:08,113 --> 01:05:10,082
Condragulations, you're the third

1741
01:05:10,182 --> 01:05:13,252
finalist in the grand finale next week.

1742
01:05:13,819 --> 01:05:15,754
You may join the other queens.

1743
01:05:26,932 --> 01:05:29,168
Suki Doll.

1744
01:05:30,202 --> 01:05:33,472
We saw that you've poured your heart this week

1745
01:05:33,539 --> 01:05:35,874
and in this lip sync.

1746
01:05:37,109 --> 01:05:39,411
We want to see more from our fashion queen

1747
01:05:39,445 --> 01:05:40,212
with a golden heart

1748
01:05:40,245 --> 01:05:41,981
in the grand finale.

1749
01:05:43,015 --> 01:05:45,851
Shantay you also stay.

1750
01:05:47,019 --> 01:05:49,488
Condragulations, Suki Doll!

1751
01:05:49,722 --> 01:05:51,223
You are the last finalist

1752
01:05:51,223 --> 01:05:53,592
to make it to the grand finale.

1753
01:05:53,625 --> 01:05:55,361
We have a Top 4!

1754
01:05:58,697 --> 01:06:00,065
Yes!

1755
01:06:00,165 --> 01:06:01,867
Oh, my God!

1756
01:06:02,001 --> 01:06:02,801
There's so many things

1757
01:06:02,801 --> 01:06:03,602
that I've worked for,

1758
01:06:03,602 --> 01:06:04,503
that I've thrived for,

1759
01:06:04,503 --> 01:06:06,672
and having this validation

1760
01:06:06,705 --> 01:06:09,041
is such a marking moment

1761
01:06:09,108 --> 01:06:10,976
that just gives you a pat on your back

1762
01:06:11,043 --> 01:06:12,044
that can tell you

1763
01:06:12,077 --> 01:06:13,479
“Breathe, it's okay,

1764
01:06:13,512 --> 01:06:14,346
you've done it,

1765
01:06:14,413 --> 01:06:15,414
you've worked hard,

1766
01:06:15,414 --> 01:06:17,082
and we are rewarding you.”

1767
01:06:17,416 --> 01:06:19,084
Well deserved, Suki Doll.

1768
01:06:19,151 --> 01:06:20,085
Thank you, Mama Pao.

1769
01:06:20,085 --> 01:06:21,720
Thank you for your decision.

1770
01:06:24,189 --> 01:06:25,657
I don't even know what to say.

1771
01:06:25,724 --> 01:06:28,527
Yes! Oh my God, Suki Doll!

1772
01:06:28,660 --> 01:06:32,364
Oh my God, in fairness Suki doesn’t deserve to be eliminated

1773
01:06:32,364 --> 01:06:34,299
through a lip sync battle.

1774
01:06:34,299 --> 01:06:36,802
Because Suki has a different type of drag.

1775
01:06:36,802 --> 01:06:39,238
And she should be celebrated for her drag.

1776
01:06:41,740 --> 01:06:42,975
I'll make sure that

1777
01:06:43,042 --> 01:06:44,376
every single step, I'll make you proud

1778
01:06:44,376 --> 01:06:45,277
and I'll make the world proud,

1779
01:06:45,277 --> 01:06:46,645
and I'll make myself proud.

1780
01:06:48,547 --> 01:06:49,848
Condragulations to our

1781
01:06:49,915 --> 01:06:51,917

grand finale.

1789
01:07:05,798 --> 01:07:06,932
Who among you four

1790
01:07:06,932 --> 01:07:07,933
will snatch the crown and

1791
01:07:07,966 --> 01:07:10,803
be the first Slaysian Superstar?

1792

To my Top 4 Queens,

01:07:33,292 --> 01:07:35,160
you all made your mothers proud

1803
01:07:35,194 --> 01:07:37,429
that's why your mothers are queens!

1804
01:07:37,496 --> 01:07:39,665
Your mother is a queen too!

1805
01:07:39,665 --> 01:07:40,299
And remember

1806
01:07:40,299 --> 01:07:41,467
always be true to yourself,
