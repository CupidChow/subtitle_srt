Shantay, you stay.

each of your LaLaPaRuza lip syncs.

00:00:51,791 --> 00:00:54,460
The three of you will lip sync to determine

who the Lip Sync LaLaPaRuza Slaysian Assassin Winner will be.

23

Brigiding.

24
00:01:01,867 --> 00:01:03,469
You are a winner, baby!

25
00:01:03,469 --> 00:01:04,103
This week, you, Brigiding,

26
00:01:04,103 --> 00:01:05,671
This week, you, Brigiding,

27
00:01:05,671 --> 00:01:07,440
the winner of the LaLaPaRuza

28
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:10,376
holds the power of the Golden Balut.

29
00:01:10,676 --> 00:01:11,744
The Golden Balut

30
00:01:11,777 --> 00:01:13,846
grants you the ability to choose

31
00:01:13,879 --> 00:01:15,848
two of the bottom queens

32
00:01:15,848 --> 00:01:17,717
to Lip Sync for their Lives

33
00:01:17,717 --> 00:01:19,752
in the final round of LaLaPaRuza.

34
00:01:19,752 --> 00:01:22,555
I'm giving this Balut to

35
00:01:22,888 --> 00:01:24,356
my sister, Viñas DeLuxe.

36
00:01:24,356 --> 00:01:25,658
Yuhua and Khianna.

37
00:01:25,658 --> 00:01:27,526
I'm sorry, but both of you

38
00:01:27,526 --> 00:01:29,862
are up for elimination.

39
00:01:29,862 --> 00:01:31,597
The time has come

40
00:01:31,597 --> 00:01:34,066
for you to Lip Sync

41
00:01:34,066 --> 00:01:36,635
for your Life!

42
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:39,004
Khianna.

43
00:01:39,004 --> 00:01:40,573
Shantay, you stay.

44
00:01:40,706 --> 00:01:41,674
Yuhua.

45
00:01:41,774 --> 00:01:43,909
Sashay away.

46
00:01:49,115 --> 00:01:52,418
- Oh, my God.
- Aww.

47
00:01:53,586 --> 00:01:54,453
Oh, my God.

48
00:01:54,453 --> 00:01:56,555
Lip syncing for my life, for the first time,

49
00:01:56,555 --> 00:01:57,623
feels so good.

50
00:01:57,623 --> 00:01:59,391
Girl, there were so many twists and turns.

51
00:01:59,391 --> 00:02:02,661
Stay blessed and keep on loving one another.

52
00:02:02,695 --> 00:02:03,896
Take care.

53
00:02:03,896 --> 00:02:05,097
Yuhua!

54
00:02:05,131 --> 00:02:09,135
We love you, Yuhua!

55
00:02:09,135 --> 00:02:10,636
Yuhua is love.

56
00:02:10,636 --> 00:02:14,240
It's sad to see Yuhua go, but I think

57
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,641
she's so fulfilled.

58
00:02:15,674 --> 00:02:20,513
I just want to thank Yuhua for giving me another chance

59
00:02:20,513 --> 00:02:22,148
to stay in this competition.

60
00:02:22,148 --> 00:02:24,650
You reminded me of who I am.

61
00:02:24,683 --> 00:02:27,920
I didn't expect that I needed her as a friend.

62
00:02:27,953 --> 00:02:32,358
Every moment that we had together, it was amazing.

63
00:02:32,725 --> 00:02:33,926
Look, bitch is gonna split.

64
00:02:33,926 --> 00:02:35,928
She’s gonna tumble.

65
00:02:37,663 --> 00:02:38,397
That must’ve hurt.

66
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:40,533
Who told me to do that?

67
00:02:40,533 --> 00:02:41,567
Me.

68
00:02:41,567 --> 00:02:43,169
That did hurt.

69
00:02:43,169 --> 00:02:45,638
Khianna deserved to stay.

70
00:02:45,638 --> 00:02:48,607
Other than her killer lip sync performance,

71
00:02:48,607 --> 00:02:52,244
she also used props from our Mariah Runway.

72
00:02:52,478 --> 00:02:54,847
That was the first

73
00:02:54,847 --> 00:02:58,417
- Lip Sync for Your Life this whole season.
- Right? Yeah.

74
00:02:58,884 --> 00:03:01,153
How do you feel, Khianna, lip syncing for your life?

75
00:03:01,187 --> 00:03:02,621
That was fucking iconic.

76
00:03:02,655 --> 00:03:03,889
- That was so good.
- Thank you so much.

77
00:03:03,889 --> 00:03:07,259
- With a live band, girl!
- I know! I didn't expect that!

78
00:03:07,293 --> 00:03:09,461
I didn't expect there was a live band.

79
00:03:09,461 --> 00:03:13,199
We are the Top 5!

80
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:15,768
Alarma! (Toss!)

81
00:03:15,768 --> 00:03:17,770
- Alarma!
- Do you know Alarma?

82
00:03:18,904 --> 00:03:20,239
Alarma!

83
00:03:20,306 --> 00:03:22,141
Alarma!

84
00:03:22,575 --> 00:03:24,677
I think the four other girls that is with me,

85
00:03:24,677 --> 00:03:26,745
that are Filipinas, are super strong.

86
00:03:26,745 --> 00:03:29,181
They're the sisters to be watching out.

87
00:03:29,248 --> 00:03:31,383
So how do you feel, like, being the only...

88
00:03:31,417 --> 00:03:32,351
International girl?

89
00:03:32,351 --> 00:03:33,953
I think at this moment,

90
00:03:34,053 --> 00:03:35,721
we should all consider ourselves like

91
00:03:35,721 --> 00:03:36,555
one group now.

92
00:03:36,555 --> 00:03:38,324
Yeah. Honestly, like you girls never make me

93
00:03:38,324 --> 00:03:40,192
feel like, separate from the group, to be honest.

94
00:03:40,192 --> 00:03:43,162
She just exudes that mother energy

95
00:03:43,162 --> 00:03:45,064
and she used that to this competition.

96
00:03:45,064 --> 00:03:48,367
So she really deserves the spot in the Top 5.

97
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,569
And I think you're almost Filipino now.

98
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:52,838
You look like a fool!

99
00:03:53,105 --> 00:03:55,140
You look like a fool!

100
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:56,342
Girl.

101
00:03:56,342 --> 00:03:59,879
I need to step my pussy up!

102
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:01,447
I'm so excited and

103
00:04:01,447 --> 00:04:02,581
nervous but...

104
00:04:02,581 --> 00:04:04,216
as said by the brilliant drag queen,

105
00:04:04,216 --> 00:04:05,284
Viñas DeLuxe,

106
00:04:05,284 --> 00:04:07,486
“Just believe in yourself, and a win won't be far!”

107
00:04:17,963 --> 00:04:20,432
The winner of Drag Race Philippines: Slaysian Royale

108
00:04:20,432 --> 00:04:21,734
will receive a one-year supply of

109
00:04:21,734 --> 00:04:23,702
Anastasia Beverly Hills Cosmetics.

110
00:04:23,702 --> 00:04:27,006
A coveted spot on the Drag Race Slaysian Hall of Fame.

111
00:04:27,339 --> 00:04:28,507
And a cash prize of...

112
00:04:28,507 --> 00:04:30,042
2 Million Pesos!

113
00:04:30,042 --> 00:04:31,543
Powered by Bingo Plus.

114
00:04:31,543 --> 00:04:34,046
Tonight with our extra special guest judges,

115
00:04:34,046 --> 00:04:35,314
Precious Paula Nicole

116
00:04:35,314 --> 00:04:36,916
and Sasha Colby!

117
00:04:51,297 --> 00:04:52,665
Love it!

118
00:04:52,698 --> 00:04:54,633
It's a new day in the Werkroom.

119
00:04:54,633 --> 00:04:55,734
At this point, you know what?

120
00:04:55,734 --> 00:04:57,937
I'm ready for any challenges.

121
00:04:57,937 --> 00:05:00,072
Oh! Whatever challenge that is.

122
00:05:00,072 --> 00:05:02,274
You want us to do some carpentry? Go!

123
00:05:02,274 --> 00:05:04,209
- Okay.
- Oh, my God!

124
00:05:04,243 --> 00:05:06,946
- We're Top 5!
- Top 5!

125
00:05:06,979 --> 00:05:08,080
We're Top 5!

126
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,748
I'm the last international queen standing,

127
00:05:09,782 --> 00:05:12,685
but I'm the most iconic, so why not?

128
00:05:12,718 --> 00:05:14,720
Oh, my God. It's so loose now in the Werkroom.

129
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,888
Just like Brigiding.

130
00:05:15,888 --> 00:05:16,822
Kidding!

131
00:05:17,656 --> 00:05:21,593
- Congratulations, Brigiding, on your win! Wow!
- Thank you!

132
00:05:21,593 --> 00:05:23,362
After this second RuBadge,

133
00:05:23,362 --> 00:05:24,430
I really felt that...

134
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:25,731
Oh, okay.

135
00:05:25,731 --> 00:05:27,199
This is "the game face is on."

136
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:29,001
Let's get to the top right now.

137
00:05:29,168 --> 00:05:30,336
Do you miss Yuhua?

138
00:05:30,336 --> 00:05:31,170
No.

139
00:05:32,571 --> 00:05:35,874
My last international sister is sent home,

140
00:05:35,908 --> 00:05:37,776
but at the same time, she shouldn't have tested me.

141
00:05:37,776 --> 00:05:39,178
The reason why I picked her

142
00:05:39,211 --> 00:05:40,746
is because she told me twice

143
00:05:40,746 --> 00:05:42,147
that I'm not a good performer.

144
00:05:42,314 --> 00:05:42,848
Oh!

145
00:05:43,215 --> 00:05:44,116
Were you offended?

146
00:05:44,149 --> 00:05:45,084
At first, no.

147
00:05:45,084 --> 00:05:46,719
But on the second time I was like, baby.

148
00:05:47,219 --> 00:05:48,387
- Yeah.
- Let's do it.

149
00:05:48,387 --> 00:05:49,888
So yeah, that's our picture.

150
00:05:49,888 --> 00:05:51,190
You're a good performer.

151
00:05:51,223 --> 00:05:54,126
Suki really is a fierce competitor.

152
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:56,295
She is a performer of her own.

153
00:05:56,295 --> 00:05:57,396
I can see it...

154
00:05:58,197 --> 00:05:59,365
On a billboard...

155
00:06:00,766 --> 00:06:02,434
Because a billboard don't move, right?

156
00:06:03,736 --> 00:06:04,670
Iconic.

157
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:05,938
- This is iconic.
- Yeah.

158
00:06:10,109 --> 00:06:13,812
I am so happy to see Khianna fight once again.

159
00:06:13,812 --> 00:06:15,948
Because I know her story and

160
00:06:15,948 --> 00:06:18,717
I know she really needs this.

161
00:06:18,751 --> 00:06:20,552
Okay, congratulations,

162
00:06:20,552 --> 00:06:22,855
- On the Golden Balut.
- to the Golden Balut receiver.

163
00:06:22,855 --> 00:06:25,591
- Congratulations, Sis.
- Thank you so much.

164
00:06:25,591 --> 00:06:28,494
If she had really chosen me to lip sync,

165
00:06:28,494 --> 00:06:29,661
I would've just left

166
00:06:29,661 --> 00:06:31,897
and she'd have that on her conscience for the rest of her life.

167
00:06:31,897 --> 00:06:32,564
Kidding!

168
00:06:33,665 --> 00:06:36,268
Slaysian Royale format is canceled.

169
00:06:36,301 --> 00:06:37,269
You are happy.

170
00:06:37,302 --> 00:06:38,604
Because you saved yourself from the bottom.

171
00:06:38,604 --> 00:06:40,372
- Yeah.
- This is good for her.

172
00:06:40,372 --> 00:06:41,373
Because you're always going to be bottom.

173
00:06:41,373 --> 00:06:43,242
Well, don't pray that I'm going to be in the bottom, bitch!

174
00:06:43,242 --> 00:06:45,477
Lip syncing for your life in this competition

175
00:06:45,477 --> 00:06:46,478
is so good.

176
00:06:46,512 --> 00:06:47,379
I love that.

177
00:06:47,846 --> 00:06:50,549
Everyone here has a RuBadge

178
00:06:50,582 --> 00:06:52,451
and I'm sitting here naked,

179
00:06:52,451 --> 00:06:53,719
bare, and alive.

180
00:06:53,719 --> 00:06:55,154
So I want to be sure that

181
00:06:55,187 --> 00:06:58,090
I have something to cover these beauties.

182
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:00,492
I'm so excited to fight for the crown

183
00:07:00,492 --> 00:07:03,228
with the best queens in this season.

184
00:07:03,295 --> 00:07:05,697
Khianna, a sickeningly talented lip syncer.

185
00:07:05,697 --> 00:07:09,868
We have Brigiding serving us star quality.

186
00:07:09,868 --> 00:07:13,939
We have Suki, an incredible designer for the house down boots.

187
00:07:13,939 --> 00:07:16,075
And then we have Arizona...

188
00:07:17,309 --> 00:07:18,777
Oh, my God!

189
00:07:19,778 --> 00:07:21,680
Ooh, girl!

190
00:07:21,814 --> 00:07:24,083
She done already done had herses.

191
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:25,851
My Queens.

192
00:07:25,851 --> 00:07:26,852
Hi!

193
00:07:26,852 --> 00:07:30,055
Can you sell the fantasy and seal your fate?

194
00:07:30,089 --> 00:07:32,891
Or will you flop and be second rate?

195
00:07:33,158 --> 00:07:36,929
Build that brand and keep your sales high

196
00:07:36,962 --> 00:07:40,299
or you can kiss those coins goodbye!

197
00:07:40,432 --> 00:07:42,334
You better werk!

198
00:07:42,668 --> 00:07:43,435
Oh, my God.

199
00:07:43,435 --> 00:07:45,771
- Sell it, baby.
- We're going to sell outside, like, food.

200
00:07:46,472 --> 00:07:48,707
Haller! Haller! Haller!

201
00:07:49,675 --> 00:07:50,976
Mama Pao!

202
00:07:51,043 --> 00:07:52,778
Mama Pao!

203
00:07:52,811 --> 00:07:54,513
Mama Pao!

204
00:07:54,546 --> 00:07:56,582
- And then, there were five.
- Aww.

205
00:07:56,582 --> 00:07:59,384
You, Queens, have represented your franchises,

206
00:07:59,384 --> 00:08:01,386
Canada and the Philippines

207
00:08:01,386 --> 00:08:03,188
with such poise and grace

208
00:08:03,222 --> 00:08:06,024
tantamount to Asian excellence.

209
00:08:06,358 --> 00:08:08,627
TANTAMOUNT?!

210
00:08:08,627 --> 00:08:10,262
For today's Mini Challenge,

211
00:08:10,262 --> 00:08:12,865
we're taking you on a whirlwind tour of the most

212
00:08:12,865 --> 00:08:14,333
breathtaking views in the Philippines

213
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:16,768
- without leaving the Werkroom.
- Ooh.

214
00:08:17,436 --> 00:08:18,804
So Queens, you have 15 minutes,

215
00:08:18,804 --> 00:08:21,840
to change into your Tour-rizz quick drag looks.

216
00:08:21,874 --> 00:08:23,342
Do it quick, and hurry up ladies

217
00:08:23,342 --> 00:08:25,244
while there's still Piso Fare!

218
00:08:25,544 --> 00:08:26,245
Go!

219
00:08:26,545 --> 00:08:28,480
Tour-rizz tour-rizz tour-rizz tour-rizz...

220
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:31,083
Okay, Queens, you need to pose the house down

221
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:34,620
and photo bomb these tourist spots in the country.

222
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:38,557
The queen with the most meme-worthy photo wins!

223
00:08:38,557 --> 00:08:41,193
And capturing your Tour-rizz photobombing looks today

224
00:08:41,193 --> 00:08:43,662
is none other than, photographer to the stars,

225
00:08:43,662 --> 00:08:45,430
Seven Baretto!

226
00:08:46,431 --> 00:08:48,600
Oh, my God!

227
00:08:48,634 --> 00:08:49,601
He's a snack.

228
00:08:51,069 --> 00:08:52,738
Let's start with Suki Doll!

229
00:08:53,805 --> 00:08:58,210
My campy Tour-rizz look is Grandma Doll.

230
00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:00,946
You have never met her, but you want to meet her.

231
00:09:02,481 --> 00:09:03,849
Oh, she jumped.

232
00:09:04,183 --> 00:09:05,317
What the—

233
00:09:06,285 --> 00:09:07,319
More face towards me.

234
00:09:07,319 --> 00:09:08,654
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

235
00:09:08,654 --> 00:09:09,087
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

236
00:09:10,689 --> 00:09:11,657
Brigiding.

237
00:09:11,657 --> 00:09:12,824
I'm the kind of tourist who is

238
00:09:12,824 --> 00:09:14,826
bougie, and looks like I just flew in from abroad.

239
00:09:14,826 --> 00:09:16,862
I'm feeling fancy, as if I'm on a safari.

240
00:09:18,564 --> 00:09:19,398
That's Mommy Dionisia.
(Manny Pacquiao's mother)

241
00:09:19,398 --> 00:09:20,632
I thought it was Veruschka.

242
00:09:21,133 --> 00:09:22,034
Veruschka?

243
00:09:22,601 --> 00:09:23,168
Nice.

244
00:09:23,168 --> 00:09:25,971
- There you go. Nice nice nice nice.
- Arch that back more. Come on, arch.

245
00:09:26,004 --> 00:09:27,873
Holy shit, your balls!

246
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,042
Oh, my God, the bitch's balls are slipping out.

247
00:09:30,042 --> 00:09:30,876
Gooped!

248
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:36,248
We have Viñas DeLuxe.

249
00:09:36,348 --> 00:09:36,848
Oh.

250
00:09:37,416 --> 00:09:39,151
At least...

251
00:09:40,452 --> 00:09:42,554
Pretend you're pissing on me.

252
00:09:42,554 --> 00:09:44,189
Viñas was hilarious.

253
00:09:44,189 --> 00:09:46,625
She was an alien who fell in Boracay.

254
00:09:52,064 --> 00:09:53,298
Arizona Brandy.

255
00:09:53,398 --> 00:09:55,701
I'm giving you Plastic Bag Realness.

256
00:09:55,701 --> 00:09:58,170
I am the plastic, the kind that just gets thrown away.

257
00:09:58,370 --> 00:09:59,905
I want to do the Dingdong Dantes pose.
(A Filipino actor in a popular Filipino meme)

258
00:09:59,905 --> 00:10:01,240
1, 2, 3, go.

259
00:10:03,275 --> 00:10:04,977
- It's time to get serious.
- Serious? Okay.

260
00:10:05,143 --> 00:10:06,378
1, 2, 3, go!

261
00:10:09,715 --> 00:10:12,317
I think this is the best she's ever looked.

262
00:10:12,317 --> 00:10:13,385
Kidding!

263
00:10:15,554 --> 00:10:17,256
Khianna.

264
00:10:17,256 --> 00:10:18,857
I am a pregnant woman

265
00:10:19,057 --> 00:10:20,559
doing her maternity shoot.

266
00:10:20,692 --> 00:10:21,593
That's how you do it!

267
00:10:22,427 --> 00:10:24,096
Okay, next pose.

268
00:10:24,329 --> 00:10:26,265
We can't see the volcano anymore.

269
00:10:26,265 --> 00:10:27,799
Mommy's so flexible.

270
00:10:29,334 --> 00:10:30,035
The baby is coming.

271
00:10:31,403 --> 00:10:32,704
I think this is it.

272
00:10:32,971 --> 00:10:34,873
Khianna is at the Mayon Volcano.

273
00:10:34,873 --> 00:10:36,842
I think that water leakage

274
00:10:36,842 --> 00:10:38,944
is gonna extinguish the whole volcano.

275
00:10:44,883 --> 00:10:47,152
Queens, I hope you bought souvenirs,

276
00:10:47,152 --> 00:10:49,788
because you are all born scene-stealers.

277
00:10:49,788 --> 00:10:51,356
In short, attention-seekers.

278
00:10:52,524 --> 00:10:55,460
But one of you is a certified Photo-Bombing Queen.

279
00:10:55,527 --> 00:10:57,162
Seven, will you do the honors?

280
00:10:57,195 --> 00:10:59,998
And our winner for today's Mini Challenge is...

281
00:11:03,335 --> 00:11:04,703
Khianna with a K!

282
00:11:06,738 --> 00:11:08,573
Yay!

283
00:11:09,174 --> 00:11:10,442
Oh, my God!

284
00:11:10,442 --> 00:11:12,911
Am I the only one who won four challenges?

285
00:11:12,911 --> 00:11:15,013
I think I am, so...

286
00:11:16,381 --> 00:11:19,051
- Condragulations, Khianna!
- Oh, my God!

287
00:11:19,051 --> 00:11:22,387
You won a cash tip of 20,000 pesos.

288
00:11:23,522 --> 00:11:25,357
Mini Challenge Slayer!

289
00:11:25,357 --> 00:11:27,326
Too bad there's no RuBadge from it, Sis.

290
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,028
Thank you very much, Seven!

291
00:11:30,062 --> 00:11:31,530
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Seven!

292
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:32,597
See you!

293
00:11:32,698 --> 00:11:34,766
Queens, for this week's Maxi Challenge,

294
00:11:34,766 --> 00:11:37,569
we're making herstory with the first-ever,

295
00:11:37,569 --> 00:11:39,137
DragCon Slaysia

296
00:11:39,304 --> 00:11:39,705
Oh!

297
00:11:39,705 --> 00:11:42,741
where charisma meets commerce.

298
00:11:42,741 --> 00:11:44,943
And only the fiercest will prevail.

299
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:47,045
PREVAIL?!

300
00:11:47,045 --> 00:11:49,281
Another historical moment

301
00:11:49,314 --> 00:11:52,818
for the Drag Race franchises all over the world.

302
00:11:52,851 --> 00:11:54,753
Come on, Slaysian Royale!

303
00:11:54,753 --> 00:11:57,756
Each one of you must present and showcase your brand

304
00:11:57,756 --> 00:12:01,226
and personality at your DIY DragCon booth.

305
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,829
We have to brand and design?

306
00:12:04,096 --> 00:12:07,733
I mean, this is a Maxi Challenge designed for Suki.

307
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:11,870
Khianna, because you won the Mini Challenge,

308
00:12:12,037 --> 00:12:14,606
you have the advantage of giving another queen a disadvantage

309
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:16,975
by taking a minute from her presentation

310
00:12:16,975 --> 00:12:18,877
and adding it to yours.

311
00:12:20,011 --> 00:12:21,580
Who am I giving it to?

312
00:12:24,783 --> 00:12:25,684
Suki Doll.

313
00:12:26,885 --> 00:12:28,653
Ooh!

314
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,889
Khianna's giving me a disadvantage.

315
00:12:31,022 --> 00:12:32,591
To the girl that has no badge.

316
00:12:32,791 --> 00:12:34,593
This is crazy thinking.

317
00:12:34,993 --> 00:12:36,528
Your DragCon booth, Queens,

318
00:12:36,528 --> 00:12:38,263
should be an explosion of you.

319
00:12:38,263 --> 00:12:41,333
From the fierce design to the fab fan activities,

320
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:42,601
and must-have merch.

321
00:12:42,601 --> 00:12:43,769
So it has to have merch.

322
00:12:43,769 --> 00:12:45,971
Make it a vibe, so we never want to leave.

323
00:12:46,138 --> 00:12:47,005
Bye!

324
00:12:47,205 --> 00:12:49,741
Bye!

325
00:12:54,446 --> 00:12:55,147
Oh!

326
00:12:55,781 --> 00:12:57,883
So it's the battle of the drawings now.

327
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:59,451
Is it a battle of drawing?

328
00:12:59,584 --> 00:13:00,452
I don't see any battle.

329
00:13:00,752 --> 00:13:01,186
Ooh.

330
00:13:01,753 --> 00:13:05,724
I am beyond excited that it's a DragCon Booth Design Challenge,

331
00:13:05,724 --> 00:13:08,093
because I am known for my branding

332
00:13:08,093 --> 00:13:10,162
and one of the strongest brands that I have

333
00:13:10,162 --> 00:13:11,763
in this competition is me.

334
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:14,366
Thank God, I took one minute from you.

335
00:13:14,499 --> 00:13:17,602
Did you feel like, I owe you from the last challenge?

336
00:13:18,403 --> 00:13:19,938
- No!
- No?

337
00:13:19,971 --> 00:13:21,606
I just think that you're gonna do great.

338
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,841
Well, you didn't see this before, so,

339
00:13:22,841 --> 00:13:24,709
why did you choose me before seeing the sketch?

340
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:28,013
Because I've always told you that you're fierce competition, that's why.

341
00:13:28,046 --> 00:13:29,047
I don't even have a RuBadge.

342
00:13:29,047 --> 00:13:30,115
Why not one of them?

343
00:13:30,115 --> 00:13:30,649
Oh.

344
00:13:30,715 --> 00:13:31,349
Huh?

345
00:13:31,349 --> 00:13:32,317
That's a good question.

346
00:13:32,317 --> 00:13:34,853
So I don't have one already and you want to eliminate me?

347
00:13:34,986 --> 00:13:35,754
Is that the reason?

348
00:13:36,054 --> 00:13:37,722
- Not really.
- So silent, right?

349
00:13:37,889 --> 00:13:39,624
There’s a little bit of getting even.

350
00:13:39,758 --> 00:13:40,759
That's how we do it in the province.

351
00:13:40,759 --> 00:13:42,227
If someone pokes you,

352
00:13:42,227 --> 00:13:43,061
you poke back.

353
00:13:43,462 --> 00:13:44,796
Khianna.

354
00:13:46,631 --> 00:13:48,700
With love and sisterhood,

355
00:13:49,334 --> 00:13:51,937
I send to you that disadvantage.

356
00:13:53,972 --> 00:13:55,607
I hope you enjoy your extra minute

357
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:57,609
- Yeah, it's just a minute.
- by ruining our sisterhood.

358
00:13:57,676 --> 00:13:58,677
Ooh!

359
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:06,852
Oh, my God!

360
00:14:07,018 --> 00:14:09,421
It's another Design Challenge and

361
00:14:09,421 --> 00:14:11,156
I always do space out.

362
00:14:16,394 --> 00:14:17,429
There you go.

363
00:14:17,429 --> 00:14:18,964
That's it. I'm flustered.

364
00:14:19,798 --> 00:14:21,099
What the fuck am I going to do?

365
00:14:26,037 --> 00:14:28,773
I've done my booth before with my bestie, Icesis.

366
00:14:28,874 --> 00:14:31,643
Oh, a black sewing machine.

367
00:14:31,643 --> 00:14:32,711
Yeah.

368
00:14:33,512 --> 00:14:35,814
- You requested for that?
- Of course.

369
00:14:35,814 --> 00:14:37,616
When I saw Suki's booth,

370
00:14:37,616 --> 00:14:41,319
girl, I started to feel nervous and got in my head because

371
00:14:41,319 --> 00:14:43,121
she's so good.

372
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:45,857
Suki!

373
00:14:46,491 --> 00:14:48,126
Girl, you're almost done?

374
00:14:50,462 --> 00:14:51,296
She's done!

375
00:14:52,564 --> 00:14:54,633
Thank you for the disadvantage.

376
00:14:55,033 --> 00:14:57,269
Everything is always planned with Suki.

377
00:14:57,269 --> 00:14:59,137
So this is where we go.

378
00:14:59,237 --> 00:15:00,338
Are you done, Arizona?

379
00:15:00,572 --> 00:15:03,174
This challenge, you know, it's very useful because

380
00:15:03,542 --> 00:15:05,944
it's preparing us for the real world after.

381
00:15:05,944 --> 00:15:09,247
I'm excited but I really do work slow.

382
00:15:09,247 --> 00:15:09,848
See?

383
00:15:10,649 --> 00:15:11,716
Well, fuck.

384
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:14,486
Or maybe we can just pay someone?

385
00:15:14,653 --> 00:15:15,620
How about you, Sis?

386
00:15:15,921 --> 00:15:19,624
- I'm also pretty confident about what I'm doing now.
- Uh-huh.

387
00:15:19,624 --> 00:15:21,092
Me and my boyfriend,

388
00:15:21,092 --> 00:15:21,793
woah!

389
00:15:21,793 --> 00:15:23,762
We design for events sometimes,

390
00:15:23,762 --> 00:15:26,565
and make decorations, for example, for debuts...

391
00:15:26,565 --> 00:15:27,666
So it’s like...

392
00:15:27,832 --> 00:15:29,701
I'm just channeling Kevin today.

393
00:15:29,701 --> 00:15:30,769
Shoutout to my boyfriend!

394
00:15:30,769 --> 00:15:32,337
Because I've never been to a booth,

395
00:15:32,337 --> 00:15:34,406
so all I am going to say is...

396
00:15:34,973 --> 00:15:35,974
My brain needs a re-booth.

397
00:16:00,565 --> 00:16:03,068
Slaydies and gentle fluids.

398
00:16:03,401 --> 00:16:04,603
Welcome to

399
00:16:04,636 --> 00:16:06,571
DragCon Slaysia!

400
00:16:06,571 --> 00:16:08,406
Woo-hoo!

401
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:11,810
Before we start this pivotal celebration—

402
00:16:12,077 --> 00:16:13,979
PIVOTAL?!

403
00:16:14,245 --> 00:16:16,081
I would like to say a few words.

404
00:16:17,382 --> 00:16:18,583
A few words.

405
00:16:21,019 --> 00:16:22,020
It's all so exciting.

406
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:24,022
I think this challenge will open so many doors.

407
00:16:24,055 --> 00:16:27,959
This makes me feel that soon, there might be a DragCon Asia

408
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:30,061
and that it's going to be in the Philippines so,

409
00:16:30,061 --> 00:16:31,997
I can't wait for that to happen.

410
00:16:32,731 --> 00:16:34,099
Here we go!

411
00:16:35,266 --> 00:16:38,303
And now we are officially open!

412
00:16:39,738 --> 00:16:40,538
Welcome!

413
00:16:40,538 --> 00:16:44,342
And this is the first-ever DragCon Slaysia.

414
00:16:44,542 --> 00:16:45,977
And this is my first time.

415
00:16:46,244 --> 00:16:48,246
Yes!

416
00:16:52,884 --> 00:16:55,020
Brigiding. Hello, hi!

417
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:57,656
Suddenly there were two beautiful Drag Queens that arrived.

418
00:16:57,822 --> 00:16:59,858
They’re really a fan of me they said.

419
00:16:59,924 --> 00:17:02,093
I can’t help it, if they’re really a fan.

420
00:17:02,193 --> 00:17:04,863
And they support me, I love that.

421
00:17:04,896 --> 00:17:06,831
I will give it back right away.

422
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:10,402
- I'm such a big fan!
- Hello, hello, hello, darling.

423
00:17:11,336 --> 00:17:13,705
Precious and Sasha Colby's energy was so good,

424
00:17:13,705 --> 00:17:16,074
so I needed to match that energy.

425
00:17:16,274 --> 00:17:18,877
I am shooting my show.

426
00:17:18,943 --> 00:17:20,879
- So can you be my guest?
- Show?

427
00:17:20,912 --> 00:17:22,247
Come on, sit down. Sit down here.

428
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:23,982
You may ask me a question now.

429
00:17:24,315 --> 00:17:26,951
How do you feel you're doing in the competition so far?

430
00:17:28,787 --> 00:17:30,021
Sasha, you know what?

431
00:17:30,021 --> 00:17:32,757
I am very, very grateful to be doing this

432
00:17:32,791 --> 00:17:34,559
another chance in life.

433
00:17:34,826 --> 00:17:38,029
I remember you won Miss Continental

434
00:17:38,063 --> 00:17:40,532
and you won RuPaul's Drag Race.

435
00:17:40,565 --> 00:17:42,233
How do you feel about winning twice?

436
00:17:42,233 --> 00:17:43,401
Two crowns already.

437
00:17:43,401 --> 00:17:46,337
It feels really good. I highly recommend it.

438
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:50,442
Before you join the game,

439
00:17:50,442 --> 00:17:53,278
- I need you to buy something from my merch table.
- Yeah, I'm going to buy some merch.

440
00:17:53,278 --> 00:17:55,814
That's my exit line during the first season.

441
00:17:55,947 --> 00:17:57,649
Learning is the new winning.

442
00:17:57,816 --> 00:17:59,317
This is a branding challenge.

443
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:01,486
So this is what you're looking for, right?

444
00:18:01,486 --> 00:18:03,488
Well, let me show you now.

445
00:18:03,655 --> 00:18:05,924
You also get a chance

446
00:18:05,924 --> 00:18:07,959
to stir the wheel

447
00:18:07,959 --> 00:18:10,261
because we're not stirring the pot anymore.

448
00:18:10,295 --> 00:18:12,831
This is Slaysian Royale so we're stirring the wheel.

449
00:18:13,031 --> 00:18:14,799
Come on, stir the wheel.

450
00:18:17,268 --> 00:18:18,803
You get a surprise!

451
00:18:20,071 --> 00:18:20,872
Blue?

452
00:18:20,872 --> 00:18:21,506
- Wait.
- White?

453
00:18:21,506 --> 00:18:22,607
Blue?

454
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:24,776
What will you do?

455
00:18:25,076 --> 00:18:25,910
Oh, my gosh.

456
00:18:27,412 --> 00:18:28,513
Sasha.

457
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:31,583
- Never in my life.
-  As my fan,

458
00:18:32,016 --> 00:18:33,685
I need you to

459
00:18:33,852 --> 00:18:37,055
- give everyone in this whole DragCon
- What the fuck?

460
00:18:37,055 --> 00:18:38,990
a jump split.

461
00:18:39,023 --> 00:18:41,059
- I know you can do it.
- Now, I've never done a jump split

462
00:18:41,059 --> 00:18:41,960
but I will do a split.

463
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,762
- In 3, 2,
- Very cutely into a split.

464
00:18:43,795 --> 00:18:45,263
3, 2, 1!

465
00:18:46,097 --> 00:18:47,265
Okay, I'm going to do the jump.

466
00:18:49,033 --> 00:18:50,702
- Okay, that's a jump split, right there.
- Oh!

467
00:18:51,336 --> 00:18:53,238
This is my balls.

468
00:18:53,238 --> 00:18:55,440
Okay, you have to try these balls

469
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,008
- I like this one
- Because this is a very famous

470
00:18:57,008 --> 00:18:59,410
delicacy here in the Philippines.

471
00:19:01,146 --> 00:19:01,880
You like it?

472
00:19:02,247 --> 00:19:03,615
It's so sour! Fuck you.

473
00:19:05,483 --> 00:19:07,385
Do you like it? It's sour balls.

474
00:19:07,652 --> 00:19:09,220
That's how my balls taste like.

475
00:19:09,287 --> 00:19:10,722
So let's have a selfie!

476
00:19:13,224 --> 00:19:14,392
I think I got this.

477
00:19:14,392 --> 00:19:17,162
Let's see what I'll do for you, girls.

478
00:19:17,362 --> 00:19:18,963
Wow!

479
00:19:18,997 --> 00:19:21,166
- Alarma! (Toss!)
- Come on, here, boys.

480
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:21,866
Do you know what Alarma is?

481
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:22,467
No.

482
00:19:22,467 --> 00:19:24,836
- I'm going to show you what Alarma is.
- It's a tradition.

483
00:19:24,836 --> 00:19:26,137
- Okay, I'll watch.
- Will I carry you, Sis?

484
00:19:26,137 --> 00:19:27,438
- And then you take the photos.
- I'll take the picture.

485
00:19:27,438 --> 00:19:28,640
- Yes.
- You're going to take the photos.

486
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,275
- Go, Sasha Colby.
- What the fuck?

487
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:31,743
Okay!

488
00:19:38,016 --> 00:19:39,484
Thank you, Brigs.

489
00:19:40,985 --> 00:19:42,420
- Thank you!
- Bye!

490
00:19:42,453 --> 00:19:44,589
Keep shining!

491
00:19:51,229 --> 00:19:52,630
Is this for free?

492
00:19:52,664 --> 00:19:55,633
For my super fan, everything is free.

493
00:19:55,667 --> 00:19:57,936
You're my number one in my heart.

494
00:19:58,002 --> 00:20:00,738
- Oh, thank you!
- Do you know what else I have to offer to you today?

495
00:20:00,805 --> 00:20:03,241
- What? What?
- Look right on the rack here.

496
00:20:03,241 --> 00:20:06,411
This is the Ready-to-Wear Collection

497
00:20:06,411 --> 00:20:08,246
as seen on TV.

498
00:20:08,246 --> 00:20:11,149
I will empower the loved one

499
00:20:11,149 --> 00:20:13,384
which is my brand of Suki Doll.

500
00:20:13,418 --> 00:20:15,453
But do you know what else I want to offer to you today?

501
00:20:15,453 --> 00:20:17,422
A personalized design.

502
00:20:17,622 --> 00:20:19,524
- Why don't you sit here, Ms. Precious?
- Okay.

503
00:20:19,524 --> 00:20:21,426
- Sasha, stand here for me please.
- I would love to.

504
00:20:21,526 --> 00:20:26,030
Let me give you a full, interactive, sensational

505
00:20:26,497 --> 00:20:28,032
- measurement.
- Okay.

506
00:20:28,399 --> 00:20:31,236
Oh, I think this tape's going to be a little bit too small.

507
00:20:31,636 --> 00:20:33,204
- Let's get a—
- Get a big one.

508
00:20:33,204 --> 00:20:34,138
Yes!

509
00:20:34,539 --> 00:20:37,041
Now, now we can measure.

510
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:39,010
It's very voluptuous.

511
00:20:39,177 --> 00:20:41,179
Voluptuous?!

512
00:20:41,379 --> 00:20:43,281
For me, the most important part is

513
00:20:43,281 --> 00:20:45,383
the experience of the customer,

514
00:20:45,416 --> 00:20:46,818
and of course, the mega fans.

515
00:20:46,951 --> 00:20:49,520
So I want to be sure that they have something that's unique,

516
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,356
personalized, hand-sketched,

517
00:20:51,656 --> 00:20:53,825
handmade from Suki Doll.

518
00:20:53,858 --> 00:20:54,826
Ladies.

519
00:20:54,859 --> 00:20:55,894
Why don't we look...

520
00:20:55,894 --> 00:20:56,694
Look over there!

521
00:20:57,896 --> 00:20:58,863
There you go.

522
00:20:58,897 --> 00:21:00,198
Sasha.

523
00:21:00,331 --> 00:21:02,033
A design for you.

524
00:21:02,066 --> 00:21:03,701
- Just like that!
- And just like that.

525
00:21:03,735 --> 00:21:04,469
Look over there!

526
00:21:05,703 --> 00:21:06,304
Did no—

527
00:21:06,704 --> 00:21:07,705
My wig!

528
00:21:09,073 --> 00:21:11,109
Do you like your design?

529
00:21:11,209 --> 00:21:12,677
I love it.

530
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:13,912
- You love it?
- Yes.

531
00:21:14,012 --> 00:21:16,881
The crazy part is I'm actually a mega fan of Sasha.

532
00:21:17,081 --> 00:21:19,784
So both of us are just bouncing back our energies.

533
00:21:19,851 --> 00:21:22,320
And this is the real DragCon experience.

534
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:23,421
Precious, look over there!

535
00:21:25,156 --> 00:21:26,324
Look over there again!

536
00:21:26,691 --> 00:21:27,292
Look over there!

537
00:21:27,859 --> 00:21:28,660
Look back over here!

538
00:21:28,893 --> 00:21:29,560
Okay, yes.

539
00:21:30,194 --> 00:21:31,663
Now for you, Precious.

540
00:21:32,196 --> 00:21:32,997
That's you!

541
00:21:33,998 --> 00:21:35,633
I think you have a big asset,

542
00:21:35,667 --> 00:21:37,669
so we're going to give you volume,

543
00:21:37,669 --> 00:21:38,603
and flowers.

544
00:21:38,603 --> 00:21:41,973
Now, since you love your colors and your designs,

545
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:43,975
I have especially made them

546
00:21:43,975 --> 00:21:45,209
in advance!

547
00:21:45,944 --> 00:21:47,345
This is for you, Sasha,

548
00:21:47,812 --> 00:21:49,247
and this is for you.

549
00:21:49,247 --> 00:21:49,948
What is this?

550
00:21:49,948 --> 00:21:50,848
But hold on.

551
00:21:51,249 --> 00:21:52,383
Do you know Labubu?

552
00:21:52,417 --> 00:21:53,618
This is LaSusu.

553
00:21:53,885 --> 00:21:55,453
Now, for LaSusu,

554
00:21:55,486 --> 00:21:57,889
Sasha, why don't you reveal for us your

555
00:21:57,922 --> 00:21:59,524
personalized LaSusu?

556
00:22:02,493 --> 00:22:03,928
Did I get the proportions right?

557
00:22:04,963 --> 00:22:06,664
- Is the proportion right?
- She's a Colby!

558
00:22:06,664 --> 00:22:07,565
Yeah!

559
00:22:07,665 --> 00:22:09,334
I don't know how to feel about mine.

560
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,135
No, because yours my darling,

561
00:22:11,169 --> 00:22:12,370
is the asset!

562
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:13,137
Ooh!

563
00:22:13,137 --> 00:22:14,572
- Yes.
- There it is.

564
00:22:14,605 --> 00:22:16,708
If you come to see me at DragCon,

565
00:22:16,708 --> 00:22:20,178
expect the same treatment and of course, the same merch.

566
00:22:20,178 --> 00:22:21,612
This is new release.

567
00:22:21,612 --> 00:22:23,114
And here's your personalized card.

568
00:22:24,215 --> 00:22:27,785
Precious, because you're my most precious gem. Aww!

569
00:22:28,019 --> 00:22:29,187
I need money...

570
00:22:29,187 --> 00:22:29,787
Why?

571
00:22:29,787 --> 00:22:30,655
I need money?

572
00:22:30,688 --> 00:22:32,323
Because everything has to be paid!

573
00:22:32,323 --> 00:22:33,624
DragCon is expensive!

574
00:22:33,658 --> 00:22:34,892
Bitch, I'm from this country,

575
00:22:34,892 --> 00:22:37,195
- so I'm much richer than you, so
- Yes.

576
00:22:37,228 --> 00:22:38,129
take these all.

577
00:22:38,129 --> 00:22:38,629
Wow!

578
00:22:38,629 --> 00:22:39,464
Stop!

579
00:22:39,497 --> 00:22:41,165
Can we make it rain for each one of us?

580
00:22:41,699 --> 00:22:42,333
- Of course!
- Yes!

581
00:22:42,333 --> 00:22:43,835
Make it rain. Make it rain.

582
00:22:46,704 --> 00:22:49,640
This is going to be the best day of your lives.

583
00:22:50,041 --> 00:22:51,609
- I’m so happy.
- Thank you, Suki.

584
00:22:51,609 --> 00:22:52,643
Smile, ladies.

585
00:22:53,044 --> 00:22:54,045
LaSusu!

586
00:22:54,145 --> 00:22:55,780
LaSusu!

587
00:23:01,185 --> 00:23:04,055
- Oh, my God, hello!
- Hello, hello, hello!

588
00:23:04,055 --> 00:23:05,423
Oh, my God, hi!

589
00:23:05,423 --> 00:23:06,524
Oh, my God, welcome!

590
00:23:06,524 --> 00:23:11,662
Welcome to my blasted booth! Where the blabbermouth is—

591
00:23:11,729 --> 00:23:14,265
- Oh, sorry. Hi! Oh, my God.
- Hi, my name is Precious.

592
00:23:14,265 --> 00:23:16,100
- Welcome. Nice to meet you.
- And this is my girl friend, Sasha.

593
00:23:16,134 --> 00:23:18,603
- Nice to meet you, oh, I love it.
- She's a huge fan.

594
00:23:18,636 --> 00:23:21,939
Everyone's booths are so fun and I think mine's the worst.

595
00:23:21,939 --> 00:23:24,542
So I thought I should amp up

596
00:23:24,575 --> 00:23:25,943
my acting and all.

597
00:23:25,977 --> 00:23:28,112
I'm going to give you my

598
00:23:28,146 --> 00:23:30,081
refreshing towelettes, come on.

599
00:23:30,081 --> 00:23:32,917
Freshly picked from my outfit.

600
00:23:32,917 --> 00:23:34,352
Go, go, go refresh yourselves

601
00:23:34,385 --> 00:23:35,853
because I know you've been into

602
00:23:36,054 --> 00:23:37,355
dirty booths of the other—

603
00:23:37,355 --> 00:23:39,424
Oh, no, no. You’re not allowed yet to go there.

604
00:23:39,457 --> 00:23:41,059
Here, here, here. Stay here, stay here. Yeah.

605
00:23:41,059 --> 00:23:42,960
We have a program to, you know,

606
00:23:43,261 --> 00:23:43,928
follow?

607
00:23:43,928 --> 00:23:45,596
I was so

608
00:23:45,663 --> 00:23:46,597
pressured.

609
00:23:47,065 --> 00:23:49,267
Oh, my God. I think she's about to faint.

610
00:23:49,267 --> 00:23:52,003
You need to sit down, here.

611
00:23:52,036 --> 00:23:54,038
- She's a huge fan.
- You need to sit down here

612
00:23:54,038 --> 00:23:57,708
because you need to be eligible to enter my booth.

613
00:23:57,975 --> 00:24:00,278
BP check? Come on, BP check?

614
00:24:00,278 --> 00:24:01,879
Come on, come on. Oh you need to stay there.

615
00:24:01,879 --> 00:24:02,780
You need to stay there.

616
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:04,048
You, bitch.

617
00:24:04,215 --> 00:24:05,116
Okay, go.

618
00:24:05,383 --> 00:24:06,150
Normal? Is it normal?

619
00:24:06,751 --> 00:24:09,187
Her BP's normal? How fabulous! So much airtime!

620
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:10,688
Okay, come here. Come here.

621
00:24:10,688 --> 00:24:11,989
My game plan is,

622
00:24:12,023 --> 00:24:14,192
whatever I've prepared,

623
00:24:14,659 --> 00:24:15,760
I'll just present it.

624
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,929
The one thing you will do in my booth,

625
00:24:17,962 --> 00:24:21,732
is you're going to defy the gravity inside the popcorn.

626
00:24:22,266 --> 00:24:24,902
You just need to catch a popcorn

627
00:24:24,902 --> 00:24:26,304
with your national mouth,

628
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:27,572
with your national mouth,

629
00:24:27,572 --> 00:24:29,273
and you will get a chance

630
00:24:29,273 --> 00:24:32,477
to win next-level, amazing prizes!

631
00:24:32,477 --> 00:24:33,911
- Are you ready?
- Ready!

632
00:24:33,911 --> 00:24:34,979
- Are you ready?
- Ready!

633
00:24:35,012 --> 00:24:36,914
Okay. Sasha, first.

634
00:24:36,948 --> 00:24:38,449
Okay, 1, 2, 3, go!

635
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:42,353
Go! More! More!

636
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:44,722
More! My booth is falling apart!

637
00:24:44,856 --> 00:24:47,458
More! You need to catch just one.

638
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:49,961
Just one!

639
00:24:51,095 --> 00:24:52,497
Please!

640
00:24:52,997 --> 00:24:55,800
My win is in your hands!

641
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,969
Please!

642
00:24:58,169 --> 00:25:00,171
She got one! She got one! She got one!

643
00:25:00,571 --> 00:25:02,373
Oh, my God!

644
00:25:02,373 --> 00:25:04,909
It’s already in, and now it’s coming out again.

645
00:25:05,576 --> 00:25:07,645
You caught two!

646
00:25:07,645 --> 00:25:09,480
You're so great in catching

647
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:12,250
because you got two popcorns.

648
00:25:12,283 --> 00:25:15,286
Oh, my God. This is the most amazing prize ever

649
00:25:15,286 --> 00:25:16,420
that you will receive!

650
00:25:17,889 --> 00:25:18,689
Okay.

651
00:25:18,723 --> 00:25:20,391
You're gonna receive

652
00:25:20,391 --> 00:25:24,061
a ticket from the DeLuxe Airlines.

653
00:25:24,061 --> 00:25:26,564
- You have an airline?
- Yes, I have an airline.

654
00:25:26,564 --> 00:25:29,167
- Wow.
- And you're so lucky because I only have

655
00:25:29,167 --> 00:25:30,401
two here.

656
00:25:30,434 --> 00:25:35,439
So this is the DeLuxe Airline using the mananang-gay!
(Manananggal: Half-bodied, winged monster)

657
00:25:35,706 --> 00:25:37,542
Come on, come on, mananang-gay!

658
00:25:37,909 --> 00:25:40,444
It's a trip to anywhere you want in the globe.

659
00:25:40,478 --> 00:25:42,880
- Anywhere?
- But it's one-way only.

660
00:25:43,114 --> 00:25:45,082
I totally forgot that

661
00:25:45,349 --> 00:25:46,417
oh, my God,

662
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:47,718
I should have...

663
00:25:47,818 --> 00:25:48,953
prepared to do an improv challenge

664
00:25:48,953 --> 00:25:50,821
that requires bantering and whatnot.

665
00:25:51,222 --> 00:25:53,558
The only thing you need to remember is,

666
00:25:53,558 --> 00:25:54,759
if there's a Ruveal,

667
00:25:54,759 --> 00:25:55,760
then Ruveal.

668
00:25:55,793 --> 00:25:58,996
Okay, fly my Queens, fly!

669
00:25:58,996 --> 00:26:01,032
I literally just presented the booth and then

670
00:26:01,032 --> 00:26:01,732
that was it.

671
00:26:01,732 --> 00:26:04,101
I was so rattled that I went through it too quickly.

672
00:26:11,209 --> 00:26:12,276
Hi!

673
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:13,678
Hi, how are you?

674
00:26:15,079 --> 00:26:17,648
When Sasha and Precious visited my booth,

675
00:26:17,648 --> 00:26:19,483
I thought we were going to go on a route.

676
00:26:19,717 --> 00:26:22,019
This is a place where it's easy

677
00:26:22,019 --> 00:26:23,087
to drink.

678
00:26:23,387 --> 00:26:25,356
And it's easy to speak.

679
00:26:25,489 --> 00:26:27,558
- Yes.
- And speak...

680
00:26:27,558 --> 00:26:30,394
So on that note, would you like some drinks?

681
00:26:30,394 --> 00:26:31,562
- Yes, please!
- Yes!

682
00:26:31,562 --> 00:26:33,397
Let's have a toast, okay?

683
00:26:33,397 --> 00:26:36,867
- Cheers.
- When I say “Arizona” you say “One more shot.”

684
00:26:37,068 --> 00:26:39,937
- Arizona!
- One more shot!

685
00:26:39,937 --> 00:26:41,939
Cheers!

686
00:26:42,306 --> 00:26:44,575
Sasha and Precious, drinking with me.

687
00:26:44,609 --> 00:26:46,744
I’m still reminding myself that, no.

688
00:26:46,777 --> 00:26:48,212
They're the mega fans.

689
00:26:48,212 --> 00:26:49,814
- You thought it's fake, right?
- Shit, that's real.

690
00:26:50,615 --> 00:26:52,316
- Yes, it's real!
- It's got a punch!

691
00:26:52,316 --> 00:26:54,518
For our entertainment for today,

692
00:26:54,552 --> 00:26:56,887
- we have the Vape Tricks.
- Okay.

693
00:27:08,165 --> 00:27:09,333
What?!

694
00:27:13,204 --> 00:27:14,672
- You want to try?
- That was amazing.

695
00:27:14,839 --> 00:27:17,174
Never before seen vape tricks.

696
00:27:17,174 --> 00:27:18,242
That's how you do it!

697
00:27:18,276 --> 00:27:19,910
- Wow!
- Are you entertained?

698
00:27:19,944 --> 00:27:20,745
- I am entertained.
- Super.

699
00:27:20,778 --> 00:27:22,380
If you're entertained, you need to tip.

700
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:22,947
Okay.

701
00:27:22,947 --> 00:27:24,148
Oh.

702
00:27:24,482 --> 00:27:26,117
Yes, put it inside me.

703
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:28,386
Right!

704
00:27:28,953 --> 00:27:31,956
So here, in Arizona Brandy's Speakeasy,

705
00:27:31,956 --> 00:27:34,859
I would like it for you to speak easy on me.

706
00:27:34,892 --> 00:27:35,693
- Okay!
- So,

707
00:27:35,726 --> 00:27:37,261
if you have something to confess,

708
00:27:37,295 --> 00:27:40,131
if you have any problems, you would like some advice for,

709
00:27:40,131 --> 00:27:42,600
I am here to listen. Okay?

710
00:27:42,633 --> 00:27:45,736
I want them to know that Arizona Brandy is not

711
00:27:45,736 --> 00:27:47,872
just a girl who drinks, drinks, drinks.

712
00:27:47,905 --> 00:27:51,542
Arizona Brandy is also a friend by your side.

713
00:27:52,777 --> 00:27:54,679
How do I take care of

714
00:27:54,712 --> 00:27:56,814
all my kids as a single mother?

715
00:27:56,814 --> 00:27:59,617
Oh, my God, you're a single mother.

716
00:27:59,617 --> 00:28:01,552
So you need to take care of your kids,

717
00:28:01,552 --> 00:28:03,621
as a drag queen takes care of

718
00:28:03,621 --> 00:28:05,956
their wigs, right?

719
00:28:06,223 --> 00:28:07,858
- That's what you do.
- Smart.

720
00:28:08,092 --> 00:28:08,759
- Right?
- Smart.

721
00:28:08,759 --> 00:28:10,861
We've had a really long night,

722
00:28:10,895 --> 00:28:15,199
so sometimes I want it to be easy for you to cure hangover.

723
00:28:15,199 --> 00:28:16,334
- Oh, yes!
- Yes.

724
00:28:16,334 --> 00:28:18,202
So we have the Hangover Kit!

725
00:28:18,636 --> 00:28:20,438
Inside the Hangover Kit,

726
00:28:20,438 --> 00:28:22,440
is one shot of

727
00:28:22,573 --> 00:28:23,908
brandy!

728
00:28:23,908 --> 00:28:25,009
Again?

729
00:28:25,042 --> 00:28:27,011
And then, another shot of

730
00:28:27,578 --> 00:28:29,146
brandy!

731
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:31,248
And then one more shot of...

732
00:28:32,016 --> 00:28:33,517
Brandy!

733
00:28:34,085 --> 00:28:35,286
Vodka!

734
00:28:36,253 --> 00:28:37,955
That's how you cure your hangover?

735
00:28:37,955 --> 00:28:40,391
- Yes, that is how we cure...
- Two brandies and a vodka.

736
00:28:40,424 --> 00:28:41,058
- Wow.
- That's smart.

737
00:28:41,092 --> 00:28:43,027
Yeah. That's really smart of me.

738
00:28:43,027 --> 00:28:44,628
And this is for only—

739
00:28:44,995 --> 00:28:46,130
how much is this?

740
00:28:46,364 --> 00:28:48,666
2,014 pesos!

741
00:28:48,666 --> 00:28:49,600
Right!

742
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:51,836
I enjoyed it and I think that's the key.

743
00:28:51,836 --> 00:28:53,537
The key is just to enjoy,

744
00:28:53,537 --> 00:28:56,107
and the people around you will enjoy as well.

745
00:28:56,107 --> 00:28:59,677
And if ever you get stressed with all your DragCon experience,

746
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:01,212
you can go back here

747
00:29:01,245 --> 00:29:04,048
- and we can have some more drinks, okay?
- Okay.

748
00:29:04,048 --> 00:29:05,683
Thank goodness, I'll be back.

749
00:29:05,683 --> 00:29:08,152
One of the best experiences and I hope

750
00:29:08,152 --> 00:29:09,520
I gave that to them.

751
00:29:09,854 --> 00:29:12,656
Or did I just give them a headache? I'm not sure.

752
00:29:12,823 --> 00:29:14,692
Bye!

753
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,802
What's, oh, why are you crying?

754
00:29:24,802 --> 00:29:26,537
She's just such a big fan.

755
00:29:26,537 --> 00:29:28,773
- Omg.
- Such a big fan.

756
00:29:28,773 --> 00:29:30,040
What's your name, baby?

757
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:32,243
- Precious.
- Tell her your name, baby.

758
00:29:32,243 --> 00:29:34,812
These are winners so I just thought,

759
00:29:34,812 --> 00:29:37,148
that I'm an actor, I'm a professional.

760
00:29:37,148 --> 00:29:39,283
I'm gonna do whatever I can do

761
00:29:39,283 --> 00:29:39,950
with a K.

762
00:29:40,151 --> 00:29:42,253
Thank you for coming here in my booth,

763
00:29:42,286 --> 00:29:44,655
because this is the i-Khiannic booth

764
00:29:44,688 --> 00:29:47,291
where we have Khiannic movements,

765
00:29:47,458 --> 00:29:48,893
Khiannic moments,

766
00:29:48,926 --> 00:29:53,264
and we are gonna have a Khia-tic experience.

767
00:29:53,297 --> 00:29:54,732
Are you ready?

768
00:29:54,932 --> 00:29:58,068
But before coming in, we are gonna have

769
00:29:58,068 --> 00:29:59,203
a Dance Kombat

770
00:29:59,203 --> 00:30:01,305
with a K!

771
00:30:01,305 --> 00:30:03,307
Now, I want to see you dance together!

772
00:30:08,612 --> 00:30:09,413
Come on, dance.

773
00:30:10,681 --> 00:30:12,283
You have something in your back.

774
00:30:12,316 --> 00:30:13,017
What?

775
00:30:13,083 --> 00:30:15,453
I know how to khiropract with a K.

776
00:30:15,586 --> 00:30:17,021
Breathe in.

777
00:30:17,254 --> 00:30:18,689
Breathe out.

778
00:30:21,592 --> 00:30:22,760
Perfect!

779
00:30:23,093 --> 00:30:25,996
And we are going to krack our neck, with a K.

780
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:27,231
1, 2, 3!

781
00:30:29,533 --> 00:30:31,969
Next, can I have my chairs?

782
00:30:32,002 --> 00:30:32,503
Okay.

783
00:30:32,736 --> 00:30:34,305
Are you ready for the

784
00:30:34,438 --> 00:30:35,539
an-

785
00:30:35,539 --> 00:30:37,708
- kupuncture?
What? Ancu-

786
00:30:38,108 --> 00:30:40,211
- Akupunkture with a K.
- Sure.

787
00:30:40,344 --> 00:30:42,480
- Okay. I really need it.
- You mean, you mean those sharp

788
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:45,683
- thingies?
- The sharp thingies that we put on our face.

789
00:30:50,855 --> 00:30:53,457
- That feel good?
- It fell.

790
00:30:54,258 --> 00:30:56,694
Does that feel sharp enough?

791
00:30:57,595 --> 00:30:58,996
Where is it? Where is it?

792
00:30:59,597 --> 00:31:01,332
Oh, nevermind. Fuck that.

793
00:31:03,701 --> 00:31:05,903
Damn! What the fuck's happening?

794
00:31:05,936 --> 00:31:07,638
Picture!

795
00:31:09,507 --> 00:31:11,008
Wacky!

796
00:31:12,042 --> 00:31:13,444
In Tagalog, it's "ang cute" (so cute).

797
00:31:14,278 --> 00:31:16,714
ang-cute-picture that's why we were taking pictures

798
00:31:16,714 --> 00:31:17,948
with the needles.

799
00:31:18,082 --> 00:31:19,650
Since it's a wacky shot.

800
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:20,985
Did nobody get it?

801
00:31:21,018 --> 00:31:22,152
Thank you so much.

802
00:31:22,152 --> 00:31:23,521
Where's the time?

803
00:31:24,588 --> 00:31:27,324
And now, what do you want to do next?

804
00:31:28,626 --> 00:31:30,327
- Do you have a merch? Can I ask?
- Yes!

805
00:31:30,361 --> 00:31:31,862
I have a merch.

806
00:31:31,896 --> 00:31:35,099
This is the one-of-a-kind merch.

807
00:31:35,232 --> 00:31:36,567
The stick.

808
00:31:37,902 --> 00:31:39,403
- Ahh.
- Oh.

809
00:31:39,803 --> 00:31:41,038
Get it.

810
00:31:41,605 --> 00:31:44,441
My merch always gets sold out so

811
00:31:44,942 --> 00:31:47,144
I wasn't able to bring merch.

812
00:31:48,178 --> 00:31:50,314
Oh, my God, Khianna, I just want to say

813
00:31:50,347 --> 00:31:52,449
you changed my life.

814
00:31:53,484 --> 00:31:56,687
- Thank you so much.
- Don't worry, dear.

815
00:31:56,687 --> 00:31:58,756
You will change my life after this.

816
00:31:59,123 --> 00:32:00,958
If you're going to save me.

817
00:32:01,692 --> 00:32:02,326
Well...

818
00:32:02,493 --> 00:32:03,827
Pit Crew!

819
00:32:03,827 --> 00:32:05,663
Bring me the food.

820
00:32:06,664 --> 00:32:09,500
Now, that's why you bought those sticks,

821
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:11,535
because that's very important.

822
00:32:11,936 --> 00:32:14,572
Because how are you gonna eat if you don't have a stick?

823
00:32:14,705 --> 00:32:16,840
Now, eat for me.

824
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,742
It's like selling someone a pen.

825
00:32:18,742 --> 00:32:19,176
Okay.

826
00:32:19,176 --> 00:32:21,912
Can you write your name in the paper please?

827
00:32:22,513 --> 00:32:24,148
"But I don't have a pen."

828
00:32:24,214 --> 00:32:25,616
But I have a pen!

829
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:28,385
I have a apple...

830
00:32:29,787 --> 00:32:31,355
- So...
- What is this?

831
00:32:31,355 --> 00:32:34,592
- Can you please explain first for Sasha?
- This,

832
00:32:34,625 --> 00:32:38,429
is a Kikiam, with a K!

833
00:32:38,796 --> 00:32:41,565
And then you put it in the vinegar

834
00:32:41,565 --> 00:32:44,768
you swirl it around and then...

835
00:32:46,136 --> 00:32:48,205
So they finally ate using the

836
00:32:48,205 --> 00:32:50,641
stick with a K.

837
00:32:50,641 --> 00:32:51,809
Are you gagging?

838
00:32:52,109 --> 00:32:53,310
Can we take a picture?

839
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:55,512
Yeah, of course, anytime!

840
00:32:56,213 --> 00:32:57,815
It was a little chaotic.

841
00:32:57,815 --> 00:32:59,550
That was what I was saying, that

842
00:32:59,583 --> 00:33:01,986
this is gonna be a K-otic experience.

843
00:33:02,353 --> 00:33:03,988
Oh, my God!

844
00:33:04,254 --> 00:33:06,223
- Oh, my God, sis, that was so much fun.
- So much fun!

845
00:33:06,256 --> 00:33:07,124
What did you get? What did you get?

846
00:33:07,124 --> 00:33:09,360
I got, I mean, I got a plane ticket.

847
00:33:09,426 --> 00:33:11,261
- A plane ticket?
- I got a doll, yes!

848
00:33:11,295 --> 00:33:13,897
Oh, Pit Crew!

849
00:33:13,897 --> 00:33:15,733
- That's the merch?
- Would you like my balls?

850
00:33:16,367 --> 00:33:17,835
Because we have this.

851
00:33:17,835 --> 00:33:19,803
Gosh, alright. Come on, guys, let's go.

852
00:33:23,974 --> 00:33:26,577
- You break her, you buy her.
- DragCon Slaysia, I love you!

853
00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:28,112
I love you, RuPaul!

854
00:33:28,112 --> 00:33:30,180
- Can't take her anywhere.
- I love you, Mama Pao!

855
00:33:30,214 --> 00:33:31,849
I love everyone!

856
00:33:32,016 --> 00:33:33,283
Shut up!

857
00:33:40,391 --> 00:33:43,060
Slaysian Royale!

858
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:46,263
It's a new day in the Werkroom and I am fantastic!

859
00:33:46,263 --> 00:33:48,265
Because who am I? Suki Doll.

860
00:33:48,298 --> 00:33:50,000
I'm excited for the Runway.

861
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,869
I mean, it's a redemption of like

862
00:33:51,869 --> 00:33:53,170
our seasons, right?

863
00:33:53,504 --> 00:33:55,706
So bigger drag, bigger outfits.

864
00:33:55,706 --> 00:33:57,541
Category is RuBirth.

865
00:33:57,574 --> 00:33:58,809
RuBirth!

866
00:33:58,809 --> 00:34:01,011
It's our best Runway

867
00:34:01,011 --> 00:34:02,780
- Do you feel rebirthed?
- and we make it into an elevated version.

868
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:04,415
So I think I really want to do like

869
00:34:04,448 --> 00:34:07,317
my makeup now because it's going to be so elevated.

870
00:34:08,452 --> 00:34:09,787
Even the makeup's elevated?

871
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:11,055
I needed this.

872
00:34:11,055 --> 00:34:12,356
I need this Runway.

873
00:34:12,356 --> 00:34:12,990
I want...

874
00:34:12,990 --> 00:34:14,692
This is why I came here,

875
00:34:14,692 --> 00:34:16,427
I want to redeem myself.

876
00:34:21,565 --> 00:34:23,367
Guys, how was your experience on

877
00:34:23,367 --> 00:34:25,102
the real DragCon, girl?

878
00:34:25,102 --> 00:34:26,804
- Our real DragCon?
- Yeah.

879
00:34:26,804 --> 00:34:29,073
Because I haven't been to DragCon, so.

880
00:34:29,106 --> 00:34:32,443
DragCon LA was postponed and then I couldn't afford

881
00:34:32,443 --> 00:34:34,144
going to UK by myself.

882
00:34:34,178 --> 00:34:37,781
I think that we have one of the best fan bases

883
00:34:37,781 --> 00:34:39,783
in all reality TV shows.

884
00:34:39,783 --> 00:34:42,186
They are very intense, but they're also very loving

885
00:34:42,219 --> 00:34:44,555
and they support, unconditionally, our art.

886
00:34:44,588 --> 00:34:46,423
And I think it's very important to go to DragCon

887
00:34:46,457 --> 00:34:48,459
just to see who your fans really are.

888
00:34:48,492 --> 00:34:49,526
So...

889
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:51,695
- Very happy with DragCon.
- And I think one special part of

890
00:34:51,695 --> 00:34:54,031
DragCon is you get to meet the fans and

891
00:34:54,031 --> 00:34:57,468
they tell you how much you have affected their lives

892
00:34:57,501 --> 00:34:58,469
by watching the show,

893
00:34:58,469 --> 00:35:01,538
by your story, by what you did on the show.

894
00:35:01,638 --> 00:35:04,875
I think my favorite part of DragCon UK

895
00:35:04,908 --> 00:35:08,479
is, before DragCon, all the queens meet, right?

896
00:35:08,479 --> 00:35:10,314
- Yeah, yeah.
- We have like a tea time.

897
00:35:10,314 --> 00:35:11,582
- Yeah!
- And then you get to see

898
00:35:11,615 --> 00:35:13,083
all the girls together.

899
00:35:13,083 --> 00:35:15,352
- And I realized at that moment that
- Yeah.

900
00:35:15,352 --> 00:35:17,821
- I'm part of the family now.
- Aww.

901
00:35:17,821 --> 00:35:20,157
Like, aww, I'm also a RuGirl.

902
00:35:20,357 --> 00:35:23,160
And Raja O'Hara was really nice.

903
00:35:23,193 --> 00:35:26,363
One of the most memorable times I was there in

904
00:35:26,363 --> 00:35:28,165
the US was,

905
00:35:28,165 --> 00:35:29,500
with Jiggly Caliente.

906
00:35:29,533 --> 00:35:31,335
Jiggly Caliente was so nice.

907
00:35:31,735 --> 00:35:35,806
In New York, she booked a hotel so that I have a place to stay in.

908
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:38,342
For both of us.

909
00:35:38,342 --> 00:35:40,511
She's one of the icons who's been

910
00:35:40,511 --> 00:35:43,580
advocating for Asian pride, Asian beauty,

911
00:35:43,614 --> 00:35:45,115
Asian appreciation.

912
00:35:45,182 --> 00:35:46,884
And finally, it's happening.

913
00:35:46,884 --> 00:35:49,520
I love how Jiggly judged us during our season.

914
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,522
It's very intelligent.

915
00:35:51,555 --> 00:35:53,223
She knows what she says.

916
00:35:53,223 --> 00:35:55,993
I guess what I remember most of Mama Jiggly

917
00:35:55,993 --> 00:35:57,761
is every time she came to visit us,

918
00:35:57,761 --> 00:35:59,463
or whenever she was in the Philippines,

919
00:35:59,463 --> 00:36:01,799
she always gave us her things.

920
00:36:01,832 --> 00:36:03,934
And actually as a Filipino,

921
00:36:03,967 --> 00:36:07,171
she really knows and gets all the jokes.

922
00:36:07,371 --> 00:36:08,906
She really is an icon.

923
00:36:09,006 --> 00:36:10,974
She'd always react to my posts,

924
00:36:10,974 --> 00:36:13,844
telling me I'm so great, and things like that.

925
00:36:13,844 --> 00:36:17,080
For sure I'm gonna miss her and her random check-ins.

926
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,715
I didn't really get a chance to know her as

927
00:36:18,715 --> 00:36:20,050
much as you girls did,

928
00:36:20,083 --> 00:36:22,186
but every time I encountered her, or like see her,

929
00:36:22,186 --> 00:36:24,221
she always had like the kind heart and

930
00:36:24,221 --> 00:36:25,322
she's very welcoming.

931
00:36:25,322 --> 00:36:27,958
She obviously was one of the biggest mentors for

932
00:36:27,958 --> 00:36:29,259
all of her sisterhood.

933
00:36:29,293 --> 00:36:31,295
That is the one thing you need to remember

934
00:36:31,328 --> 00:36:34,064
about Jiggly is the unlimited love

935
00:36:34,097 --> 00:36:35,065
that she always gave.

936
00:36:35,098 --> 00:36:36,733
It's my first time in the US.

937
00:36:36,733 --> 00:36:39,636
The DragCon LA 2024.

938
00:36:39,636 --> 00:36:42,005
Jiggly was there with me the whole time.

939
00:36:42,039 --> 00:36:42,873
Really?

940
00:36:45,909 --> 00:36:49,513
She helped me set up my booth, and then...

941
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:52,015
she bought food for everyone.

942
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:58,555
I'm never going to be able to tell her, after this,

943
00:36:58,555 --> 00:37:01,358
I can never tell her how...

944
00:37:01,491 --> 00:37:03,360
I did really good

945
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,429
on the challenges.

946
00:37:05,729 --> 00:37:08,031
I've always told her that

947
00:37:08,265 --> 00:37:10,767
"Jiggly, I started drag because of you."

948
00:37:10,767 --> 00:37:13,737
And she always replies with "Fuck you."

949
00:37:14,271 --> 00:37:15,005
Aww.

950
00:37:15,005 --> 00:37:17,040
But it's really true.

951
00:37:17,341 --> 00:37:21,211
If I hadn't seen that video of her on YouTube,

952
00:37:21,645 --> 00:37:23,380
I would not be here.

953
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:26,250
Back on our season, I told her that

954
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:29,319
and she let me go down the stage

955
00:37:29,353 --> 00:37:31,855
and she let me hug her.

956
00:37:32,055 --> 00:37:35,692
I dedicate this whole challenge to her.

957
00:37:35,692 --> 00:37:37,294
Thank you.

958
00:37:37,427 --> 00:37:38,428
I hope...

959
00:37:39,029 --> 00:37:40,330
I wanna see you again.

960
00:37:40,998 --> 00:37:42,633
One more time.

961
00:37:43,667 --> 00:37:46,169
Just to thank you for everything.

962
00:37:46,203 --> 00:37:48,538
I know she's going to be really proud of me.

963
00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:49,940
She'll be proud of you.

964
00:37:49,973 --> 00:37:52,009
So are you Jiggly? Kidding.

965
00:38:17,067 --> 00:38:18,635
Mabuhey!

966
00:38:18,635 --> 00:38:20,437
I'm your mothertucking host,

967
00:38:20,437 --> 00:38:23,573
and I am with child.

968
00:38:23,607 --> 00:38:24,841
And welcome to the Main Stage of

969
00:38:24,841 --> 00:38:28,011
Drag Race Philippines: Slaysian Royale!

970
00:38:29,413 --> 00:38:33,550
My precious, delicious, ambitious, industrious,

971
00:38:33,884 --> 00:38:36,653
the inaugural winner of Drag Race Philippines,

972
00:38:36,653 --> 00:38:38,355
Precious Paula Nicole.

973
00:38:38,355 --> 00:38:40,490
What are your plans for the next DragCon?

974
00:38:40,490 --> 00:38:42,659
Your mother is a Queen, Mama Pao!

975
00:38:42,659 --> 00:38:45,295
The lady in red!

976
00:38:45,295 --> 00:38:49,199
What I really want to do next is, I want to...

977
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:49,967
What?

978
00:38:50,167 --> 00:38:51,802
Cut the ribbon!

979
00:38:51,802 --> 00:38:52,936
Can I, Mama Pao?

980
00:38:52,936 --> 00:38:54,972
Scissoring skills, Precious.

981
00:38:54,972 --> 00:38:58,475
Next, she's a G-O-D-D-E-S-S!

982
00:38:58,742 --> 00:39:00,010
And a true legend.

983
00:39:00,043 --> 00:39:01,912
Winner of RuPaul's Drag Race Season 15,

984
00:39:01,912 --> 00:39:03,213
Sasha Colby!

985
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:06,149
What is a Sasha Colby booth experience?

986
00:39:06,183 --> 00:39:08,418
At a Sasha Colby booth experience,

987
00:39:08,452 --> 00:39:09,553
you can expect

988
00:39:09,553 --> 00:39:12,122
G-O-D-D-E-S-

989
00:39:12,122 --> 00:39:14,224
ASS.

990
00:39:15,392 --> 00:39:16,994
I want that.

991
00:39:16,994 --> 00:39:18,295
Thank you, Sasha.

992
00:39:18,295 --> 00:39:21,098
For this week's challenge, the Queens presented their very own

993
00:39:21,098 --> 00:39:22,599
DragCon Slaysia booth.

994
00:39:22,599 --> 00:39:26,503
And tonight, on the Runway they will be reborn.

995
00:39:27,604 --> 00:39:29,906
Racers, start your engines.

996
00:39:29,906 --> 00:39:33,844
And may the best Slaysian Queen, win!

997
00:39:35,746 --> 00:39:36,913
Category is...

998
00:39:36,913 --> 00:39:38,048
RuBirth.

999
00:39:38,048 --> 00:39:40,617
Starting with Suki Doll.

1000
00:39:43,487 --> 00:39:45,022
Suki, Suki.

1001
00:39:45,022 --> 00:39:47,224
Pula-la.
(Tagalog for Red)

1002
00:39:47,257 --> 00:39:49,359
Makes me want a red velvet.

1003
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:50,360
Yes!

1004
00:39:50,394 --> 00:39:52,029
This is my RuBirth.

1005
00:39:52,029 --> 00:39:54,564
Girl, I mean, I already look so expensive in my season,

1006
00:39:54,598 --> 00:39:57,067
but this time around I'm amplifying it.

1007
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:58,368
The shape I'm giving you.

1008
00:39:58,368 --> 00:40:02,639
This fur coat is dragging me to heaven.

1009
00:40:02,672 --> 00:40:05,642
Code red! Code red!

1010
00:40:05,709 --> 00:40:07,511
Red-y to slay!

1011
00:40:07,844 --> 00:40:11,481
- Craving for red velvet.
- Red carpet!

1012
00:40:11,548 --> 00:40:13,450
She's the red carpet.

1013
00:40:14,384 --> 00:40:15,385
Yes.

1014
00:40:17,054 --> 00:40:18,355
Brigiding.

1015
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:21,525
Yes.

1016
00:40:22,025 --> 00:40:24,227
Pink's not dead!

1017
00:40:24,361 --> 00:40:27,130
In Season 1, my Pink Pak Boom look

1018
00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:30,801
marked a turning point where I had to lip sync for my life.

1019
00:40:30,834 --> 00:40:33,737
And that's where I found my power.

1020
00:40:33,770 --> 00:40:34,971
Now I bring her back.

1021
00:40:35,005 --> 00:40:36,673
So pink, so on point,

1022
00:40:36,673 --> 00:40:37,808
and boom-serving!

1023
00:40:37,841 --> 00:40:39,976
- She's got a little dinkle berry.
- Can you see it?

1024
00:40:45,015 --> 00:40:47,017
Spray Coulee!

1025
00:40:47,017 --> 00:40:49,019
Spray Coulee.

1026
00:40:49,553 --> 00:40:51,021
- Wow.
- Werk.

1027
00:40:51,021 --> 00:40:51,788
Beautiful.

1028
00:40:54,424 --> 00:40:56,393
Viñas DeLuxe.

1029
00:40:59,062 --> 00:41:00,864
Slay!

1030
00:41:01,198 --> 00:41:03,300
That hair's defying gravity.

1031
00:41:04,468 --> 00:41:07,604
I am recreating my pink rollers look.

1032
00:41:07,971 --> 00:41:10,574
Now it's not just rollers,

1033
00:41:10,574 --> 00:41:13,043
but a Korean perm at that.

1034
00:41:13,543 --> 00:41:14,411
Peek-a-boo.

1035
00:41:15,445 --> 00:41:17,581
Peek-a-Ru.

1036
00:41:18,348 --> 00:41:21,451
When you reveal, into another reveal.

1037
00:41:21,685 --> 00:41:24,554
She looks electrifying.

1038
00:41:24,588 --> 00:41:26,256
And electri-fried.

1039
00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:28,592
She put her finger in that socket.

1040
00:41:28,625 --> 00:41:29,860
Yes!

1041
00:41:31,595 --> 00:41:33,130
Shake and go!

1042
00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:35,232
That's amazing.

1043
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:38,435
Arizona Brandy.

1044
00:41:41,138 --> 00:41:44,708
She's a super meow-del!

1045
00:41:44,708 --> 00:41:48,111
For this Runway, I chose my Animal Kingdom Couture.

1046
00:41:48,145 --> 00:41:50,680
But this time I am RuBirthed

1047
00:41:50,714 --> 00:41:51,948
as a fashion queen.

1048
00:41:52,516 --> 00:41:54,151
So I'm strutting the Runway,

1049
00:41:54,151 --> 00:41:56,520
I'm giving them tailored realness.

1050
00:41:56,553 --> 00:41:58,488
I'm giving them Arizona Brandy

1051
00:41:58,522 --> 00:42:00,257
they've never seen before.

1052
00:42:00,257 --> 00:42:04,027
I'm giving them a glimpse of what Arizona Brandy

1053
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:05,462
is heading towards

1054
00:42:05,795 --> 00:42:07,731
which is high fashion.

1055
00:42:07,831 --> 00:42:11,001
She's just purr-fection.

1056
00:42:11,835 --> 00:42:14,037
Is it Mugler or mug-ler?

1057
00:42:14,037 --> 00:42:17,207
Meow-gler!

1058
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:19,209
Khianna!

1059
00:42:20,110 --> 00:42:22,712
- Oh, my gosh.
- Let's have a ball!

1060
00:42:22,746 --> 00:42:24,581
A Carni-ball!

1061
00:42:24,581 --> 00:42:28,118
I am now wearing my Fair Couture look

1062
00:42:28,118 --> 00:42:31,821
from Drag Race Philippines Season 3, Episode 3.

1063
00:42:31,821 --> 00:42:34,691
And I chose this because I think

1064
00:42:34,724 --> 00:42:40,330
this is my best Runway, the most i-Khiannic look that I had.

1065
00:42:40,430 --> 00:42:43,533
I'm very confident that you're going to eat it up again.

1066
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:44,935
That merry

1067
00:42:44,935 --> 00:42:48,805
goes round and round

1068
00:42:48,805 --> 00:42:50,774
all the way to the back, I think.

1069
00:42:50,774 --> 00:42:53,109
Yay! All the way to the back!

1070
00:42:53,143 --> 00:42:53,843
Yay!

1071
00:42:53,877 --> 00:42:55,011
Wow.

1072
00:42:55,011 --> 00:42:56,980
Love it. She's gullible, isn't she?

1073
00:43:00,050 --> 00:43:02,219
Welcome back, ladies.

1074
00:43:02,219 --> 00:43:04,321
Because there are only five of you

1075
00:43:04,321 --> 00:43:06,323
left in the competition,

1076
00:43:06,323 --> 00:43:09,492
you will all be critiqued.

1077
00:43:10,527 --> 00:43:11,561
First up,

1078
00:43:11,595 --> 00:43:12,862
Suki Doll.

1079
00:43:13,129 --> 00:43:14,764
I just want to say that

1080
00:43:14,764 --> 00:43:17,667
I really enjoyed your booth.

1081
00:43:17,667 --> 00:43:19,236
You made me feel so welcome.

1082
00:43:19,769 --> 00:43:21,671
You were so generous.

1083
00:43:21,671 --> 00:43:23,340
As far as your booth,

1084
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:24,841
I felt

1085
00:43:24,874 --> 00:43:26,710
completely engaged the whole time.

1086
00:43:26,710 --> 00:43:28,545
Impeccable branding.

1087
00:43:28,645 --> 00:43:30,013
The branding was perfect.

1088
00:43:30,013 --> 00:43:32,048
I know exactly the queen you are.

1089
00:43:32,115 --> 00:43:33,817
And the merch was amazing.

1090
00:43:33,817 --> 00:43:35,685
- I'm taking that bag.
- Lasusu.

1091
00:43:35,719 --> 00:43:38,922
I actually love your Runway look tonight.

1092
00:43:39,022 --> 00:43:40,890
It's so expensive-looking.

1093
00:43:40,890 --> 00:43:41,992
It's so Suki Doll,

1094
00:43:41,992 --> 00:43:44,361
just like your booth as well.

1095
00:43:44,361 --> 00:43:45,829
It's on brand.

1096
00:43:45,895 --> 00:43:47,797
You did a great job, Suki Doll.

1097
00:43:47,864 --> 00:43:48,865
Thank you, Mama Pao.

1098
00:43:48,865 --> 00:43:50,367
Thank you, Suki Doll.

1099
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:51,735
Next up,

1100
00:43:51,735 --> 00:43:52,669
Brigiding.

1101
00:43:52,669 --> 00:43:54,904
Seeing your original look,

1102
00:43:55,038 --> 00:43:58,208
this is what it means to level up.

1103
00:43:58,241 --> 00:43:59,743
The scale of your hair,

1104
00:43:59,743 --> 00:44:01,011
the fit of-

1105
00:44:01,011 --> 00:44:02,445
open that tulle up for me.

1106
00:44:02,445 --> 00:44:03,580
The fit of that.

1107
00:44:03,647 --> 00:44:05,282
And to put it with that black

1108
00:44:05,282 --> 00:44:08,451
just made it look so like rock and roll.

1109
00:44:08,485 --> 00:44:09,819
This is very grown up Barbie

1110
00:44:09,819 --> 00:44:11,454
and I enjoy the gimmick

1111
00:44:11,454 --> 00:44:12,689
of the spraying the hair

1112
00:44:12,722 --> 00:44:13,923
because I'm really mad

1113
00:44:13,923 --> 00:44:15,292
that you just spray painted my hair.

1114
00:44:18,128 --> 00:44:19,529
But I will let it go

1115
00:44:19,529 --> 00:44:22,032
because you had an amazing booth as well.

1116
00:44:22,198 --> 00:44:23,233
I...

1117
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:24,934
feel like I would've gotten my money worth.

1118
00:44:25,201 --> 00:44:26,236
Because you sat down

1119
00:44:26,236 --> 00:44:27,837
and you made us feel special.

1120
00:44:27,904 --> 00:44:29,105
You were so generous.

1121
00:44:29,105 --> 00:44:31,308
You let us ask you some questions

1122
00:44:31,308 --> 00:44:32,108
and...

1123
00:44:32,108 --> 00:44:33,410
Out of all the five girls,

1124
00:44:33,410 --> 00:44:35,145
you were the only one with a Polaroid camera

1125
00:44:35,145 --> 00:44:36,513
which is very smart.

1126
00:44:36,513 --> 00:44:36,946
Thank you.

1127
00:44:36,946 --> 00:44:38,815
I love that we had a solid picture

1128
00:44:38,815 --> 00:44:41,451
together with Sasha, of course.

1129
00:44:41,751 --> 00:44:42,986
Amazing.

1130
00:44:42,986 --> 00:44:45,155
- Thank you!
- With a branding.

1131
00:44:46,623 --> 00:44:48,458
Yes, finally, right?

1132
00:44:48,458 --> 00:44:49,426
Finally?!

1133
00:44:51,828 --> 00:44:53,430
You're a star, Brigiding.

1134
00:44:53,530 --> 00:44:55,765
Don't ever doubt yourself, Brigiding.

1135
00:44:55,832 --> 00:44:56,366
Yes!

1136
00:44:56,366 --> 00:44:58,335
Because you are that girl.

1137
00:44:58,401 --> 00:44:59,169
Thank you so much.

1138
00:44:59,169 --> 00:44:59,903
Thank you.

1139
00:45:00,003 --> 00:45:00,737
Thank you.

1140
00:45:00,870 --> 00:45:02,072
Next up,

1141
00:45:02,138 --> 00:45:03,640
Viñas DeLuxe.

1142
00:45:03,673 --> 00:45:04,641
Okay.

1143
00:45:04,708 --> 00:45:05,675
Who made this wig?

1144
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:08,111
Who made this hair?

1145
00:45:08,144 --> 00:45:08,812
I need it.

1146
00:45:08,945 --> 00:45:10,113
This is so impressive.

1147
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:12,215
I love how you took your

1148
00:45:12,282 --> 00:45:14,184
original look and

1149
00:45:14,217 --> 00:45:15,251
then told a story,

1150
00:45:15,251 --> 00:45:16,519
like what happens after that?

1151
00:45:16,519 --> 00:45:17,120
You know?

1152
00:45:17,153 --> 00:45:18,655
As far as your booth,

1153
00:45:18,822 --> 00:45:20,623
I thought it was a really great concept.

1154
00:45:20,657 --> 00:45:21,157
I love you.

1155
00:45:21,157 --> 00:45:22,926
I love me some Viñas.

1156
00:45:23,093 --> 00:45:24,594
But to be quite honest, I didn't

1157
00:45:24,661 --> 00:45:26,529
feel like I would want to go back to your booth.

1158
00:45:26,529 --> 00:45:27,030
Oh!

1159
00:45:27,030 --> 00:45:28,631
Because I didn't really feel that like

1160
00:45:28,631 --> 00:45:30,233
I felt that you were more controlling

1161
00:45:30,233 --> 00:45:32,302
and was a little aggressive to a fan.

1162
00:45:32,302 --> 00:45:33,737
I wouldn't feel like

1163
00:45:33,770 --> 00:45:34,571
I would want to go back

1164
00:45:34,571 --> 00:45:36,005
and I know that's not you.

1165
00:45:36,072 --> 00:45:38,475
Maybe you could have enjoyed the moment more

1166
00:45:38,508 --> 00:45:40,744
with us and with Sasha.

1167
00:45:40,810 --> 00:45:42,846
Because I felt like you're in a hurry

1168
00:45:42,846 --> 00:45:44,714
and, you know, running out of time

1169
00:45:44,714 --> 00:45:46,416
and you were so conscious about

1170
00:45:46,483 --> 00:45:47,484
you running out of time

1171
00:45:47,484 --> 00:45:49,152
that you might not present everything.

1172
00:45:49,219 --> 00:45:50,920
And then when I looked at the timer,

1173
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:53,790
you had an extra three minutes.

1174
00:45:53,823 --> 00:45:55,692
Whatever's going in your head,

1175
00:45:56,092 --> 00:45:57,560
bring it down and slow it down a little bit.

1176
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:58,762
Because you had so much time.

1177
00:45:59,529 --> 00:46:01,898
Viñas tell me what happened.

1178
00:46:01,898 --> 00:46:03,066
I don't know.

1179
00:46:03,366 --> 00:46:04,334
There's a lot of things

1180
00:46:04,334 --> 00:46:05,869
that's happening in my mind.

1181
00:46:05,902 --> 00:46:07,103
Maybe because

1182
00:46:07,137 --> 00:46:09,472
I was eliminated in the seventh episode

1183
00:46:09,472 --> 00:46:11,541
during my season and

1184
00:46:11,841 --> 00:46:14,210
it's my first time to like,

1185
00:46:14,811 --> 00:46:17,113
get past Episode 7.

1186
00:46:17,113 --> 00:46:19,149
So I'm like thinking of

1187
00:46:19,883 --> 00:46:21,351
making the most out of it.

1188
00:46:21,384 --> 00:46:23,520
And I got into my own head.

1189
00:46:23,586 --> 00:46:25,455
I ended up overthinking everything.

1190
00:46:25,455 --> 00:46:27,557
And I'm so pressured.

1191
00:46:27,657 --> 00:46:29,759
Are you having a premonition?

1192
00:46:30,460 --> 00:46:31,628
I hope not!

1193
00:46:32,562 --> 00:46:33,997
We know that you're a wise queen

1194
00:46:33,997 --> 00:46:35,432
and you're a smart queen.

1195
00:46:35,498 --> 00:46:38,468
Even if you don't show it all at once.

1196
00:46:38,535 --> 00:46:40,170
But the idea

1197
00:46:40,303 --> 00:46:42,038
of that look is really

1198
00:46:42,138 --> 00:46:43,573
amazing and

1199
00:46:43,573 --> 00:46:45,909
only Viñas can think of that.

1200
00:46:48,077 --> 00:46:50,313
- Thank you very much, Viñas DeLuxe.
- Thank you.

1201
00:46:50,346 --> 00:46:51,247
Next up,

1202
00:46:51,247 --> 00:46:52,949
Arizona Brandy.

1203
00:46:53,016 --> 00:46:54,284
Hi!

1204
00:46:54,384 --> 00:46:55,485
Meow.

1205
00:46:55,618 --> 00:46:56,219
Meow.

1206
00:46:56,252 --> 00:46:57,520
Meow, meow, meow.

1207
00:46:57,921 --> 00:46:58,922
Meow.

1208
00:46:58,922 --> 00:46:59,889
Subtitles.

1209
00:47:01,958 --> 00:47:04,294
I love how you

1210
00:47:04,294 --> 00:47:06,796
showed us the image of the cheetah

1211
00:47:06,796 --> 00:47:08,998
when you first went to the Main Stage.

1212
00:47:08,998 --> 00:47:11,134
This look is very smart.

1213
00:47:11,201 --> 00:47:14,404
I've seen a lot of Mugler's been done badly

1214
00:47:15,205 --> 00:47:17,140
on the Drag Race Runway.

1215
00:47:17,173 --> 00:47:18,708
And this is not one of them.

1216
00:47:18,741 --> 00:47:20,109
Oh, my God.

1217
00:47:20,143 --> 00:47:23,313
As far as your DragCon booth,

1218
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:25,748
what I did appreciate is

1219
00:47:25,815 --> 00:47:27,684
let's say, Viñas

1220
00:47:27,717 --> 00:47:30,787
you both had a destination to take us on.

1221
00:47:30,954 --> 00:47:32,956
Viñas went the freeway route,

1222
00:47:32,956 --> 00:47:34,457
and you went the scenic route.

1223
00:47:34,457 --> 00:47:35,525
There was never a moment of time

1224
00:47:35,525 --> 00:47:36,826
that I was like, okay, now what?

1225
00:47:36,893 --> 00:47:38,495
The branding is amazing.

1226
00:47:38,528 --> 00:47:39,963
And for me, I'm a lush,

1227
00:47:39,963 --> 00:47:41,498
so you got me drunk and I lived.

1228
00:47:41,498 --> 00:47:42,599
Yes!

1229
00:47:42,599 --> 00:47:43,032
Period.

1230
00:47:43,032 --> 00:47:44,133
Thanks!

1231
00:47:44,534 --> 00:47:46,469
Out of all these girls,

1232
00:47:46,469 --> 00:47:48,505
you were the one I enjoyed the most

1233
00:47:48,671 --> 00:47:51,207
because you really let me know you.

1234
00:47:51,241 --> 00:47:52,308
And I had fun

1235
00:47:52,308 --> 00:47:53,610
because you listened to me,

1236
00:47:53,610 --> 00:47:54,911
you listened to Sasha.

1237
00:47:55,278 --> 00:47:59,148
One more thing that I liked about it was

1238
00:47:59,215 --> 00:48:00,250
you were selling us merch

1239
00:48:00,250 --> 00:48:01,417
while getting us drunk.

1240
00:48:01,417 --> 00:48:02,285
Yes!

1241
00:48:02,285 --> 00:48:03,486
That's so smart of you.

1242
00:48:04,454 --> 00:48:05,555
Because let's face it,

1243
00:48:05,555 --> 00:48:06,389
we have to earn money.

1244
00:48:06,422 --> 00:48:08,691
In DragCon, we need to sell,

1245
00:48:08,691 --> 00:48:10,126
we need to earn.

1246
00:48:10,126 --> 00:48:12,028
And I commend you for not forgetting that.

1247
00:48:12,095 --> 00:48:13,062
Thank you.

1248
00:48:14,264 --> 00:48:16,065
How are you feeling, Arizona?

1249
00:48:16,065 --> 00:48:18,835
I feel so happy because

1250
00:48:18,968 --> 00:48:21,638
I've never been known for my looks.

1251
00:48:21,671 --> 00:48:23,506
I've always been just the funny one,

1252
00:48:23,506 --> 00:48:25,208
not the fashion one.

1253
00:48:25,308 --> 00:48:27,243
So this is what it feels like

1254
00:48:27,277 --> 00:48:30,880
to be complimented for your outfit, your look.

1255
00:48:30,914 --> 00:48:33,316
Thank you very much.

1256
00:48:33,750 --> 00:48:35,885
And I want to thank my sisters.

1257
00:48:35,885 --> 00:48:38,621
The Royalties are still here with me.

1258
00:48:38,755 --> 00:48:40,990
They stoned this outfit.

1259
00:48:42,292 --> 00:48:44,260
That's it. Thank you.

1260
00:48:44,694 --> 00:48:46,362
And thank you, sister.

1261
00:48:46,496 --> 00:48:48,064
May I say

1262
00:48:48,231 --> 00:48:51,701
you're really becoming the fashion queen.

1263
00:48:52,135 --> 00:48:55,872
And I love that for you, Arizona Brandy.

1264
00:48:56,439 --> 00:48:58,274
Thank you very much, Arizona.

1265
00:48:58,274 --> 00:48:59,676
Thank you!

1266
00:49:01,578 --> 00:49:03,413
Next up, oh!

1267
00:49:03,446 --> 00:49:04,614
Khianna.

1268
00:49:04,614 --> 00:49:05,848
What's up?

1269
00:49:05,915 --> 00:49:06,950
When I went to your booth,

1270
00:49:06,983 --> 00:49:08,818
I already felt the nerve,

1271
00:49:08,818 --> 00:49:10,820
you were so nervous.

1272
00:49:10,853 --> 00:49:12,355
I wish like

1273
00:49:12,355 --> 00:49:15,091
maybe you used your time wisely.

1274
00:49:15,191 --> 00:49:16,659
Because there were times

1275
00:49:16,659 --> 00:49:17,694
that you were asking us—

1276
00:49:18,161 --> 00:49:20,129
“What do you want to do next?”

1277
00:49:20,229 --> 00:49:22,065
You asked me.

1278
00:49:22,065 --> 00:49:23,399
I was like, what?

1279
00:49:23,566 --> 00:49:25,702
But in your Runway look tonight,

1280
00:49:25,768 --> 00:49:26,903
it's grand.

1281
00:49:26,903 --> 00:49:27,337
Wow.

1282
00:49:27,337 --> 00:49:29,572
You're the biggest one here.

1283
00:49:29,606 --> 00:49:31,374
But the thing is,

1284
00:49:31,374 --> 00:49:32,709
this is a RuBirth.

1285
00:49:32,775 --> 00:49:34,544
It looks grand.

1286
00:49:34,744 --> 00:49:35,745
But for me,

1287
00:49:35,745 --> 00:49:38,181
I really love the past look,

1288
00:49:38,181 --> 00:49:39,816
the Ruveal with the face.

1289
00:49:40,016 --> 00:49:42,251
Knowing what the original look was,

1290
00:49:42,251 --> 00:49:44,287
your best drag, that's hard...

1291
00:49:44,287 --> 00:49:44,754
Yes.

1292
00:49:44,754 --> 00:49:45,955
to top.

1293
00:49:45,955 --> 00:49:46,756
And I was thinking

1294
00:49:46,756 --> 00:49:47,724
the only thing you could do

1295
00:49:47,724 --> 00:49:48,858
is just add more on.

1296
00:49:48,925 --> 00:49:49,559
And you did,

1297
00:49:49,559 --> 00:49:50,560
you put it all on.

1298
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:52,261
You add more faces, you add more

1299
00:49:52,261 --> 00:49:54,530
more horses, more tassel.

1300
00:49:54,530 --> 00:49:57,333
What I did feel was

1301
00:49:57,333 --> 00:49:59,402
you're a dancing girl like me.

1302
00:49:59,502 --> 00:50:00,503
All you need

1303
00:50:00,570 --> 00:50:02,639
is a leotard and a thigh-high boot,

1304
00:50:02,672 --> 00:50:04,340
and you're ready to go, just like me.

1305
00:50:04,607 --> 00:50:06,576
Sometimes we lose that

1306
00:50:06,576 --> 00:50:08,845
when we have all of this artifice on.

1307
00:50:08,845 --> 00:50:11,014
Even when we were in your booth.

1308
00:50:11,147 --> 00:50:13,783
One, the booth just seemed a little haphazard.

1309
00:50:13,783 --> 00:50:15,118
It seemed like, oh, I got nervous

1310
00:50:15,118 --> 00:50:17,220
and let me just throw some fabric on the side.

1311
00:50:17,253 --> 00:50:18,888
And it just seemed like it wasn't really well-curated.

1312
00:50:18,921 --> 00:50:20,089
And it just seemed like it wasn't really well-curated.

1313
00:50:20,089 --> 00:50:22,058
You did have a lot of great things,

1314
00:50:22,125 --> 00:50:25,294
but you were not the Khianna that we know.

1315
00:50:25,328 --> 00:50:26,696
Just really have the confidence

1316
00:50:26,696 --> 00:50:29,165
of knowing that with all this storm around you,

1317
00:50:29,198 --> 00:50:30,266
you're still you.

1318
00:50:30,266 --> 00:50:32,235
And all we want to know is you.

1319
00:50:32,669 --> 00:50:34,303
What we are trying to say to you is

1320
00:50:34,337 --> 00:50:36,472
you should learn to edit.

1321
00:50:36,806 --> 00:50:38,074
Take a step back and

1322
00:50:38,107 --> 00:50:39,676
see the bigger picture.

1323
00:50:39,776 --> 00:50:41,444
Can I say something?

1324
00:50:41,778 --> 00:50:42,378
Something.

1325
00:50:42,378 --> 00:50:43,546
Okay, you can say something.

1326
00:50:43,546 --> 00:50:45,148
- Go Khianna.
- I just wanna—

1327
00:50:45,181 --> 00:50:46,082
I just wanna say,

1328
00:50:46,082 --> 00:50:47,283
I'm just trying to like

1329
00:50:47,283 --> 00:50:48,985
you know, trying to find myself again

1330
00:50:48,985 --> 00:50:50,553
here in this competition.

1331
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:52,689
I am doing my most,

1332
00:50:53,022 --> 00:50:54,857
and yeah,

1333
00:50:54,891 --> 00:50:55,792
I'm just happy now.

1334
00:50:55,792 --> 00:50:57,694
I'm just getting all the stuff

1335
00:50:57,694 --> 00:50:58,861
that you are telling me guys,

1336
00:50:58,861 --> 00:51:00,530
and I'm fucking with it.

1337
00:51:00,697 --> 00:51:02,165
I heard that you are in the middle

1338
00:51:02,198 --> 00:51:04,400
of a rebranding period, right?

1339
00:51:04,467 --> 00:51:05,802
And I think this is what we're witnessing.

1340
00:51:05,802 --> 00:51:06,969
You're... we're witnessing your,

1341
00:51:06,969 --> 00:51:08,237
your growing pains.

1342
00:51:08,371 --> 00:51:09,605
And it's nothing to be ashamed of

1343
00:51:09,605 --> 00:51:11,140
or to be worried about.

1344
00:51:11,174 --> 00:51:13,276
But it's nice to watch

1345
00:51:13,376 --> 00:51:15,511
the new elevation of Khianna.

1346
00:51:15,578 --> 00:51:16,913
Thank you.

1347
00:51:18,481 --> 00:51:20,483
Thank you, Queens.

1348
00:51:20,550 --> 00:51:22,952
While you untuck in the Werkroom,

1349
00:51:22,952 --> 00:51:24,654
the judges and I

1350
00:51:24,687 --> 00:51:26,422
will deliberate.

1351
00:51:26,456 --> 00:51:27,757
You may now leave the stage.

1352
00:51:27,790 --> 00:51:28,758
Please evaporate.

1353
00:51:29,225 --> 00:51:30,526
Thank you.

1354
00:51:38,267 --> 00:51:40,703
Oh, my God.

1355
00:51:41,237 --> 00:51:42,972
Everybody deserves a drink.

1356
00:51:42,972 --> 00:51:43,673
Right.

1357
00:51:44,073 --> 00:51:46,909
And I'm choosing my favorite color.

1358
00:51:47,376 --> 00:51:48,444
Blue.

1359
00:51:48,478 --> 00:51:50,413
Blue? Since when?

1360
00:51:50,580 --> 00:51:51,314
Yeah.

1361
00:51:51,314 --> 00:51:53,249
In the critique

1362
00:51:53,282 --> 00:51:54,617
with a K.

1363
00:51:54,684 --> 00:51:56,519
I just felt like

1364
00:51:56,586 --> 00:51:58,154
it didn't translate

1365
00:51:58,154 --> 00:52:00,590
what I was thinking.

1366
00:52:01,057 --> 00:52:02,759
How do we feel, everybody?

1367
00:52:02,759 --> 00:52:04,761
How are we? How are we?

1368
00:52:05,762 --> 00:52:06,829
I'm okay.

1369
00:52:06,829 --> 00:52:09,398
I mean, I've been in my head

1370
00:52:09,398 --> 00:52:12,902
for the whole day.

1371
00:52:13,035 --> 00:52:13,870
But

1372
00:52:13,903 --> 00:52:16,806
when I heard what the critiques are,

1373
00:52:16,873 --> 00:52:18,174
it's like, oh yeah,

1374
00:52:18,207 --> 00:52:19,742
I agree with them.

1375
00:52:19,809 --> 00:52:21,778
It's hard to battle with your own mind,

1376
00:52:21,778 --> 00:52:23,246
your inner saboteur.

1377
00:52:23,312 --> 00:52:25,648
I've been in that place before,

1378
00:52:25,715 --> 00:52:27,183
but you can still win it.

1379
00:52:27,216 --> 00:52:29,152
It just proves that

1380
00:52:29,252 --> 00:52:30,887
I'm still

1381
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:32,221
a human being that's—

1382
00:52:32,255 --> 00:52:34,624
there's a lot of things to improve.

1383
00:52:34,657 --> 00:52:36,492
I know that I can do the DragCon,

1384
00:52:36,492 --> 00:52:38,261
I just got rattled.

1385
00:52:38,361 --> 00:52:39,562
We won’t give up.

1386
00:52:39,896 --> 00:52:41,297
As for me,

1387
00:52:41,397 --> 00:52:42,799
Very much enjoyed it.

1388
00:52:42,865 --> 00:52:44,734
I do agree with what they're saying.

1389
00:52:44,734 --> 00:52:47,136
Maybe they were right

1390
00:52:47,236 --> 00:52:49,906
to feel that I was not crazier

1391
00:52:49,906 --> 00:52:51,607
or much myself.

1392
00:52:51,607 --> 00:52:54,343
Girl, I'm so very like happy

1393
00:52:54,343 --> 00:52:55,378
about what I did.

1394
00:52:55,411 --> 00:52:57,046
I don't know if the judges were,

1395
00:52:57,046 --> 00:53:00,082
I did really enjoy everything that happened.

1396
00:53:00,082 --> 00:53:01,417
But

1397
00:53:01,484 --> 00:53:02,952
you know, it comes down to

1398
00:53:02,952 --> 00:53:04,654
what's their critique?

1399
00:53:04,887 --> 00:53:07,890
I think I'll fight as long as I kan

1400
00:53:07,957 --> 00:53:10,626
with a K!

1401
00:53:10,660 --> 00:53:12,228
I want to shake her up like,

1402
00:53:12,228 --> 00:53:14,063
“Sis, you can do this.”

1403
00:53:14,063 --> 00:53:16,199
Like, you don't need to prove to anyone

1404
00:53:16,199 --> 00:53:17,400
what you can do.

1405
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:19,836
They know what you can do, girl.

1406
00:53:19,869 --> 00:53:19,969
I'm very proud of myself.

1407
00:53:19,969 --> 00:53:20,870
I'm very proud of myself.

1408
00:53:20,870 --> 00:53:21,904
I'll be very honest.

1409
00:53:21,904 --> 00:53:24,207
The DragCon booth was more than a success.

1410
00:53:24,207 --> 00:53:27,076
I think I aced it and I was so interactive.

1411
00:53:27,176 --> 00:53:28,477
The judges had so much fun

1412
00:53:28,477 --> 00:53:29,445
at my DragCon booth

1413
00:53:29,445 --> 00:53:31,013
that they want more of it.

1414
00:53:31,314 --> 00:53:32,915
Can we do a take two?

1415
00:53:33,049 --> 00:53:34,650
The reason why I'm very nervous

1416
00:53:34,650 --> 00:53:35,952
is because of your booth.

1417
00:53:36,419 --> 00:53:37,253
Yeah.

1418
00:53:37,253 --> 00:53:39,322
- And you finished it really fast.
- When we saw your booth,

1419
00:53:39,322 --> 00:53:40,156
we were like,

1420
00:53:40,156 --> 00:53:41,157
“Oh, my gosh,

1421
00:53:41,190 --> 00:53:43,826
this bitch is really a professional.”

1422
00:53:44,060 --> 00:53:45,294
I'm very happy that they were

1423
00:53:45,294 --> 00:53:46,829
able to feel what I'm

1424
00:53:46,829 --> 00:53:48,731
trying to make them feel.

1425
00:53:48,731 --> 00:53:51,000
Comfortable, relaxed.

1426
00:53:51,267 --> 00:53:52,101
Yeah. I'm very happy.

1427
00:53:52,101 --> 00:53:52,869
And they said that

1428
00:53:52,869 --> 00:53:55,338
my booth is the most professionally looking.

1429
00:53:55,338 --> 00:53:56,706
It makes me happy that

1430
00:53:56,706 --> 00:54:00,776
every week, the judges seem to appreciate and enjoy

1431
00:54:00,843 --> 00:54:03,246
the things I serve and offer them.

1432
00:54:03,279 --> 00:54:04,480
How about you,

1433
00:54:04,513 --> 00:54:06,282
Arizona?

1434
00:54:06,883 --> 00:54:09,585
It's so nice to finally hear them

1435
00:54:09,719 --> 00:54:12,154
say they like my outfit.

1436
00:54:12,188 --> 00:54:13,222
- Yes.
- You look good.

1437
00:54:13,222 --> 00:54:14,757
Thank you.

1438
00:54:14,924 --> 00:54:17,894
I've worked so hard

1439
00:54:17,927 --> 00:54:19,395
after my season

1440
00:54:19,428 --> 00:54:21,197
to redeem myself but

1441
00:54:21,264 --> 00:54:22,598
the people still don't see it.

1442
00:54:22,598 --> 00:54:23,766
And finally,

1443
00:54:23,833 --> 00:54:25,201
when they see this,

1444
00:54:25,268 --> 00:54:26,068
they're going to see that

1445
00:54:26,068 --> 00:54:27,737
I can be a fashion queen.

1446
00:54:29,138 --> 00:54:31,140
I was branded as the fashion queen.

1447
00:54:31,140 --> 00:54:32,608
Oh, my God!

1448
00:54:32,909 --> 00:54:34,977
Let's cheers for the Top 5.

1449
00:54:34,977 --> 00:54:35,544
Like—

1450
00:54:35,544 --> 00:54:37,513
This is the strongest Top 5

1451
00:54:37,546 --> 00:54:39,048
- Ever.
- in Slaysia.

1452
00:54:39,148 --> 00:54:40,449
- In Slaysia.
- Cheers!

1453
00:54:40,883 --> 00:54:42,652
Cheers! To the Top 5!

1454
00:54:42,652 --> 00:54:45,154
Queens, last ten minutes.

1455
00:54:45,488 --> 00:54:48,791
- Queens, last ten minutes to start your lip sync song.
- Oh, my God!

1456
00:54:49,525 --> 00:54:51,427
Shit! Mama Remz came in.

1457
00:54:51,427 --> 00:54:53,529
For the first time ever,

1458
00:54:53,529 --> 00:54:54,664
I missed her.

1459
00:54:55,498 --> 00:54:57,166
She's so extra with that hair.

1460
00:54:57,166 --> 00:54:59,101
Iconic!

1461
00:54:59,802 --> 00:55:00,536
Oh, my God,

1462
00:55:00,536 --> 00:55:02,605
we missed you, Mama Remz!

1463
00:55:02,838 --> 00:55:05,274
Okay! So the “five minute queen” entered the

1464
00:55:05,274 --> 00:55:07,343
Werkroom, oh, my God. I missed her so much!

1465
00:55:07,576 --> 00:55:09,779
She still looks really beautiful.

1466
00:55:09,779 --> 00:55:11,781
I know that she prepared for this gig.

1467
00:55:11,781 --> 00:55:13,716
Because she has her curly hair.

1468
00:55:13,716 --> 00:55:15,351
Has her red lipstick.

1469
00:55:15,351 --> 00:55:17,119
She looks really beautiful.

1470
00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:21,824
I wanna hug her, then give her an uppercut.

1471
00:55:21,824 --> 00:55:23,159
Where have you been?

1472
00:55:23,159 --> 00:55:25,227
Hey! Come back here!

1473
00:55:25,227 --> 00:55:26,762
Hey! Come back!

1474
00:55:26,762 --> 00:55:28,097
Come back here, sis!

1475
00:55:28,464 --> 00:55:30,766
Now my dear DragCon Slaysian committee.

1476
00:55:30,933 --> 00:55:32,468
What can you say about Suki Doll?

1477
00:55:32,468 --> 00:55:34,370
I think she should be

1478
00:55:34,437 --> 00:55:36,872
safe or even my top tonight.

1479
00:55:36,872 --> 00:55:38,374
Suki is my winner for the night.

1480
00:55:38,374 --> 00:55:40,276
Everything was just on point.

1481
00:55:40,276 --> 00:55:41,610
And I really liked that because

1482
00:55:41,644 --> 00:55:43,179
for me it was a style challenge.

1483
00:55:43,212 --> 00:55:43,813
Brigiding.

1484
00:55:43,813 --> 00:55:45,047
I love that she made me feel

1485
00:55:45,047 --> 00:55:46,215
seen in her booth.

1486
00:55:46,282 --> 00:55:48,117
And I love the BLACKPINK

1487
00:55:48,150 --> 00:55:49,752
in the area situation.

1488
00:55:49,852 --> 00:55:52,822
This is Brigiding's redemption season.

1489
00:55:52,822 --> 00:55:54,256
Next up, Viñas DeLuxe.

1490
00:55:54,256 --> 00:55:55,424
I know Viñas

1491
00:55:55,424 --> 00:55:56,993
and I know her brand.

1492
00:55:57,026 --> 00:55:57,793
I got it,

1493
00:55:57,793 --> 00:55:59,662
but it made me feel a little uneasy.

1494
00:55:59,662 --> 00:56:00,696
So I'm a little

1495
00:56:00,730 --> 00:56:02,598
nervous about Viñas tonight.

1496
00:56:02,631 --> 00:56:04,400
I wish my sister wasn't in such a hurry.

1497
00:56:04,867 --> 00:56:06,168
Next up, Khianna.

1498
00:56:06,168 --> 00:56:08,104
Khianna is the epitome of

1499
00:56:08,104 --> 00:56:10,339
when RuPaul says “self-saboteur.”

1500
00:56:10,339 --> 00:56:10,806
Oh.

1501
00:56:10,806 --> 00:56:13,209
She knows who she is,

1502
00:56:13,209 --> 00:56:14,844
but she's really scared

1503
00:56:14,844 --> 00:56:16,278
to figure out who else she is.

1504
00:56:16,278 --> 00:56:18,280
I love the Khianna with a K,

1505
00:56:18,314 --> 00:56:19,949
but I think

1506
00:56:20,016 --> 00:56:20,816
she's a bottom.

1507
00:56:20,883 --> 00:56:22,084
I want to bottom her tonight.

1508
00:56:22,118 --> 00:56:24,120
Next up, Arizona Brandy.

1509
00:56:24,186 --> 00:56:25,554
Meow, meow, meow, meow.

1510
00:56:25,554 --> 00:56:26,288
Meow.

1511
00:56:27,857 --> 00:56:28,391
Meow.

1512
00:56:28,391 --> 00:56:30,059
Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.

1513
00:56:30,092 --> 00:56:31,660
Meow, meow.

1514
00:56:31,827 --> 00:56:32,628
Meow.

1515
00:56:32,862 --> 00:56:33,496
Meow, meo- hmm.

1516
00:56:35,498 --> 00:56:36,699
Shh!

1517
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:39,301
So noisy.

1518
00:56:39,769 --> 00:56:42,505
Bring back my branded queens.

1519
00:56:43,506 --> 00:56:45,608
Welcome back, Queens.

1520
00:56:45,775 --> 00:56:48,110
I have made my decision.

1521
00:56:51,514 --> 00:56:53,716
Arizona Brandy,

1522
00:56:54,216 --> 00:56:56,152
your DragCon booth was fun

1523
00:56:56,185 --> 00:56:58,154
and smoking hot

1524
00:56:58,320 --> 00:57:00,189
and your Runway made us

1525
00:57:00,256 --> 00:57:03,159
roar.

1526
00:57:04,994 --> 00:57:06,228
Condragulations!

1527
00:57:06,228 --> 00:57:08,497
You are the winner of this week's challenge.

1528
00:57:08,731 --> 00:57:10,499
Our fashion queen!

1529
00:57:10,733 --> 00:57:13,536
Oh, my God!

1530
00:57:13,669 --> 00:57:14,203
Oh, my God.

1531
00:57:14,203 --> 00:57:16,038
So I won again!

1532
00:57:16,038 --> 00:57:18,274
This is my second win!

1533
00:57:18,340 --> 00:57:19,608
Oh, my God!

1534
00:57:20,176 --> 00:57:21,911
I will treat everybody tonight.

1535
00:57:21,911 --> 00:57:23,379
Kidding!

1536
00:57:23,446 --> 00:57:24,747
Thank you.

1537
00:57:25,214 --> 00:57:27,716
Suki Doll.

1538
00:57:28,717 --> 00:57:30,152
In the DragCon Slaysia,

1539
00:57:30,152 --> 00:57:33,289
your merch was the most professional.

1540
00:57:34,223 --> 00:57:35,958
I saw your fashion

1541
00:57:36,025 --> 00:57:38,861
and mentor brand.

1542
00:57:40,096 --> 00:57:41,897
Condragulations!

1543
00:57:41,897 --> 00:57:43,299
You are also the winner of

1544
00:57:43,299 --> 00:57:44,800
this week's challenge.

1545
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:45,468
Oh, my God!

1546
00:57:45,468 --> 00:57:48,137
Suki Doll and Arizona Brandy.

1547
00:57:48,504 --> 00:57:51,107
- Oh, my God, fashion girlies!
- Fashion queens won!

1548
00:57:51,107 --> 00:57:53,142
Our fashion queens.

1549
00:57:53,209 --> 00:57:55,344
There's two winners and I'm part of them.

1550
00:57:55,544 --> 00:57:57,847
I mean, this is iconic.

1551
00:57:58,080 --> 00:57:59,381
We felt like this was

1552
00:57:59,381 --> 00:58:01,450
one of the best Maxi Challenges so far.

1553
00:58:01,450 --> 00:58:03,452
And you both did great.

1554
00:58:03,719 --> 00:58:04,553
You've earned a cash tip

1555
00:58:04,553 --> 00:58:05,921
of 40,000 pesos each.

1556
00:58:05,921 --> 00:58:06,789
And both of you will

1557
00:58:06,789 --> 00:58:08,791
also get a RuBadge.

1558
00:58:08,791 --> 00:58:10,960
Give them RuBadges!

1559
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:11,794
Yes!

1560
00:58:11,861 --> 00:58:14,230
- Wear it with Slaysian pride, Queens.
- Thank you!

1561
00:58:14,230 --> 00:58:17,399
I’m so happy because this is a branding challenge.

1562
00:58:17,399 --> 00:58:19,001
I wanna win this challenge.

1563
00:58:19,001 --> 00:58:22,104
I’ve worked so hard, I redeemed myself,

1564
00:58:22,104 --> 00:58:25,574
the Design Challenge, I redeemed a lot!

1565
00:58:25,641 --> 00:58:26,842
It feels great

1566
00:58:26,842 --> 00:58:28,477
to represent the international girls

1567
00:58:28,477 --> 00:58:29,778
and be at the top.

1568
00:58:29,778 --> 00:58:32,648
This is a mark in history.

1569
00:58:34,216 --> 00:58:36,852
Arizona and Suki Doll.

1570
00:58:37,019 --> 00:58:38,621
You may go back to the back of the stage.

1571
00:58:38,621 --> 00:58:40,022
Thank you.

1572
00:58:40,156 --> 00:58:42,224
Thank you.

1573
00:58:42,925 --> 00:58:45,461
What the heck, I have to split the prize amount with you!

1574
00:58:45,461 --> 00:58:45,895
Kidding!

1575
00:58:49,198 --> 00:58:50,533
Brigiding.

1576
00:58:53,836 --> 00:58:56,005
You are safe.

1577
00:58:58,307 --> 00:59:00,576
Please go to the back of the stage.

1578
00:59:08,083 --> 00:59:10,152
That means,

1579
00:59:10,553 --> 00:59:12,555
Viñas DeLuxe.

1580
00:59:12,922 --> 00:59:14,757
Khianna.

1581
00:59:15,558 --> 00:59:18,327
You two are the bottom queens of the week.

1582
00:59:18,761 --> 00:59:21,830
I did not expect this.

1583
00:59:21,830 --> 00:59:24,033
Two of the biggest competition

1584
00:59:24,066 --> 00:59:25,968

1585
00:59:25,968 --> 00:59:28,137
and one of them

1586
00:59:28,137 --> 00:59:29,471
is gonna go home.

1587
00:59:29,538 --> 00:59:31,874
These are two of the best

1588
00:59:31,907 --> 00:59:33,375
lip sync performers

1589
00:59:33,442 --> 00:59:35,211
in the whole cast.

1590
00:59:35,878 --> 00:59:37,813
Two queens stand before me.

1591
00:59:38,681 --> 00:59:39,915
Prior to tonight,

1592
00:59:39,982 --> 00:59:40,883
you were asked to prepare

1593
00:59:40,883 --> 00:59:43,185
a lip sync performance of “Race Car,”

1594
00:59:43,352 --> 00:59:46,088
by P-Pop group, CALISTA.

1595
00:59:47,022 --> 00:59:47,756
Ladies,

1596
00:59:47,823 --> 00:59:50,292
this is your last chance to impress me.

1597
00:59:50,359 --> 00:59:52,461
And save yourself from

1598
00:59:52,494 --> 00:59:54,363
elimination.

1599
00:59:55,798 --> 00:59:57,366
Khianna!

1600
00:59:57,366 --> 00:59:58,300
What the heck.

1601
00:59:58,300 --> 00:59:59,635
We should have sent you home!

1602
01:00:01,503 --> 01:00:03,839
The time has come

1603
01:00:04,673 --> 01:00:07,076
for you to Lip Sync

1604
01:00:07,276 --> 01:00:10,079

Ate V, I know that you're very good,

1606
01:00:12,348 --> 01:00:14,350
but let's give them a great fight.

1607
01:00:14,416 --> 01:00:16,318
This is going to be i-Khiannic

1608
01:00:16,385 --> 01:00:18,320
with a K!

1609
01:00:18,354 --> 01:00:19,188
Good luck, Queens.

1610
01:00:19,188 --> 01:00:21,857
And don't fuck it up.

1611
01:00:24,693 --> 01:00:27,663
Watch me vroom, vroom, vroom

1612
01:00:30,266 --> 01:00:32,601

(We here to stay)

1614
01:00:34,470 --> 01:00:36,839
Coming up fast better get out the way

1615
01:00:37,106 --> 01:00:38,140
(Get out the way)

1616
01:00:38,974 --> 01:00:41,043
Maserati when I hit the curves

1617
01:00:41,043 --> 01:00:43,145
120 and I'm still in third

1618
01:00:43,145 --> 01:00:44,713
Leave the competition in the dirt

1619
01:00:44,913 --> 01:00:47,816
Make it look easy while get'n this work

1620
01:00:48,017 --> 01:00:52,154
Savor the moment 'cause it never last

1621
01:00:52,187 --> 01:00:55,891
Straight to the top, and coming up fast

1622
01:00:55,924 --> 01:00:58,127
We do whatever it takes

1623
01:00:58,127 --> 01:00:59,762
Coming and raising the stakes

1624
01:00:59,762 --> 01:01:01,797
It's just the thrill of the chase

1625
01:01:02,798 --> 01:01:04,400
Foot off the brakes

1626
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:06,735
We coming on like a race car

1627
01:01:06,735 --> 01:01:08,404

Try to catch us but we too far

1629
01:01:10,039 --> 01:01:12,074
Live life in the fast lane, rock star

1630
01:01:12,374 --> 01:01:14,777
Khianna has this giant ass outfit.

1631
01:01:14,777 --> 01:01:16,478
I don't even know how she's hovering

1632
01:01:16,478 --> 01:01:17,379
around that stage.

1633
01:01:17,379 --> 01:01:18,814
It's crazy.

1634
01:01:18,814 --> 01:01:21,650
We coming on we're Calista

1635
01:01:21,684 --> 01:01:23,452
Watch me vroom, vroom, vroom

1636
01:01:23,485 --> 01:01:25,587
Catch us that's a no go, too slow

1637

1642
01:01:40,069 --> 01:01:42,338
Too hot to handle, we leave 'em on ice

1643
01:01:42,404 --> 01:01:43,739
- (We leave 'em on ice)
- C’mon.

1644
01:01:44,540 --> 01:01:46,542
Maserati when I hit the curves

1645
01:01:46,608 --> 01:01:48,711
See me coming and I make 'em nervous

1646
01:01:48,777 --> 01:01:50,913
Take over and I leave ‘em swervin’

1647
01:01:51,046 --> 01:01:51,547

01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:53,382

01:01:53,649 --> 01:01:57,786
Savor the moment 'cause it never last

It's just the thrill of the chase

1654
01:02:08,430 --> 01:02:10,065
Foot off the brakes

1655
01:02:10,099 --> 01:02:12,368

01:02:31,186 --> 01:02:33,021
I just burned a hundred in the gas tank

1665
01:02:33,021 --> 01:02:35,124
We play'n for keeps in this cash game

01:02:39,294 --> 01:02:41,497
more actions, more dynamics on stage.

1669
01:02:41,663 --> 01:02:44,800
While Khianna is giving the same movements.

1670
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:46,101
The same acting.

1671
01:02:46,702 --> 01:02:49,037
Switch lanes on them, take off life a runway

1672
01:02:49,071 --> 01:02:50,906
Go'n way too fast on a one way

1673
01:02:50,906 --> 01:02:52,674
One shot so it's peddle to the medal

1674
01:02:52,708 --> 01:02:54,543

01:03:32,114 --> 01:03:33,682
Yes, girls.

1692
01:03:34,483 --> 01:03:37,252
Queens, I have made my decision.

1693
01:03:42,324 --> 01:03:44,059
Viñas DeLuxe.

1694
01:03:46,695 --> 01:03:48,230
Shantay you stay.

1695
01:03:50,332 --> 01:03:51,567
Thank you.

1696
01:03:51,567 --> 01:03:53,769
You may join the other queens, Viñas.

1697
01:03:58,740 --> 01:04:00,843
Thank you, Mama Pao.

1698
01:04:04,513 --> 01:04:06,415
Khianna with a K.

1699
01:04:06,448 --> 01:04:09,585
The i-Khiannic queen from CDO.

1700
01:04:11,119 --> 01:04:13,989
You will always be a Slaysian Sensation.

1701
01:04:14,122 --> 01:04:16,458
Khianna, sashay away.

1702
01:04:20,596 --> 01:04:22,698
Bye, everyone.

1703
01:04:22,998 --> 01:04:24,733
Thank you for having me.

1704
01:04:27,769 --> 01:04:29,838
I don't know what to say.

1705
01:04:30,239 --> 01:04:31,607
Thank you.

1706
01:04:41,416 --> 01:04:43,151
Go back to your spots.

1707
01:04:43,318 --> 01:04:44,786
Back with a K!

1708
01:04:49,958 --> 01:04:52,160
Please!

1709
01:04:52,194 --> 01:04:54,696
I'm a star!

1710
01:05:01,470 --> 01:05:02,938
Well...

1711
01:05:03,739 --> 01:05:06,241
I don't really want to cry right now,

1712
01:05:07,809 --> 01:05:10,445
but I'm so sorry.

1713
01:05:11,446 --> 01:05:13,382
I'm so sorry if I disappointed you.

1714
01:05:13,415 --> 01:05:15,083
But I promise you guys

1715
01:05:15,083 --> 01:05:16,585
that this

1716
01:05:16,885 --> 01:05:18,053
is not the end.

1717
01:05:18,153 --> 01:05:20,489
What's next for Khianna?

1718
01:05:20,889 --> 01:05:22,057
I don't know.

1719
01:05:22,457 --> 01:05:23,425
Girl, I don't know what's going on

1720
01:05:23,458 --> 01:05:24,426
in my head right now,

1721
01:05:24,426 --> 01:05:26,061
but I can sense it.

1722
01:05:26,094 --> 01:05:28,564
There's a bigger picture out there.

1723
01:05:28,664 --> 01:05:30,699
I am still very thankful

1724
01:05:30,899 --> 01:05:32,901
for my run here.

1725
01:05:33,135 --> 01:05:35,904
And please don't be sad

1726
01:05:36,038 --> 01:05:37,272
for me.

1727
01:05:37,306 --> 01:05:39,408
Because it will make me sad too.

1728
01:05:39,808 --> 01:05:43,111
And I will kontinue my journey

1729
01:05:43,211 --> 01:05:45,781
with a K.

1730
01:05:46,048 --> 01:05:48,050
Kontinue with a K.

1731
01:05:50,285 --> 01:05:51,920
End scene.

1732
01:05:53,855 --> 01:05:55,424
Condragulations, Queens.

1733
01:05:55,424 --> 01:05:56,959
You all made your mothers proud.

1734
01:05:56,992 --> 01:05:58,927
So here I say your mothers are queens.

1735
01:05:59,127 --> 01:06:01,697
Your mother is a queen, too!

1736
01:06:01,730 --> 01:06:03,298
And remember, always be true to yourself,

1737
01:06:03,298 --> 01:06:04,499
in your thoughts, in your words,

1738
01:06:04,499 --> 01:06:05,667
and all that you do.

1739
01:06:05,667 --> 01:06:07,269
All heart, always and in all ways.

1740
01:06:07,269 --> 01:06:09,037
Can I get an eme up in here?

1741
01:06:09,104 --> 01:06:11,006
Eme!

1742
01:06:11,006 --> 01:06:12,608
Now let the music play! Party! Party!

1743
01:06:25,387 --> 01:06:28,223
Next on Drag Race Philippines: Slaysian Royale

1744
01:06:28,223 --> 01:06:29,491

1745
01:06:29,491 --> 01:06:31,059
you will star in a music video.

1746
01:06:31,193 --> 01:06:35,564
You will be coached by our Supergroup Queens...

1747
01:06:35,764 --> 01:06:37,432
REYN4!

1748
01:06:37,432 --> 01:06:39,801
Seeing them, I wanted to be like them.

1749
01:06:39,801 --> 01:06:41,803
I need to do everything to be like them.

1750
01:06:41,803 --> 01:06:43,572
And then it got me.

1751
01:06:43,572 --> 01:06:44,640
Pressure.

1752
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:45,374
You really hit

1753
01:06:45,374 --> 01:06:46,308
the nail on that one.

1754
01:06:46,375 --> 01:06:48,610
And you really glowed up from your season.

1755
01:06:48,677 --> 01:06:50,512
It was so beautiful watching you.

1756
01:06:50,512 --> 01:06:51,847
Like, you looked so hot.

1757
01:06:51,847 --> 01:06:54,783
It feels so rewarding to finally be here,

1758
01:06:54,783 --> 01:06:56,952
be the final four, the Top 4.

1759
01:06:56,952 --> 01:06:58,120
Can I be honest?

1760
01:06:58,120 --> 01:07:00,022
I also didn't see you in this finale.

1761
01:07:00,055 --> 01:07:01,189
Wow!
