Previously on Drag Race Philippines: Slaysian Royale.

2
00:00:04,247 --> 00:00:05,715
This week's Maxi Challenge,

3
00:00:05,715 --> 00:00:06,783
we will be doing

4
00:00:06,949 --> 00:00:08,518
the Snatch...

5
00:00:08,518 --> 00:00:10,319
Elections!

6
00:00:10,653 --> 00:00:11,687
Khianna.

7
00:00:11,687 --> 00:00:13,022
It's a campaign video,

8
00:00:13,022 --> 00:00:14,390
so you should convince

9
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:15,725
the people to vote you.

10
00:00:15,792 --> 00:00:17,326
But I didn't feel that.

11
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:19,228
Siam Phusri.

12
00:00:19,295 --> 00:00:20,696
You're portraying Lisa, right?

13
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:23,199
It didn't quite give me that Lisa vibe.

14
00:00:23,466 --> 00:00:24,267
Brigiding.

15
00:00:24,333 --> 00:00:26,869
And what I think you mastered in this

16
00:00:26,869 --> 00:00:28,271
one-minute campaign,

17
00:00:28,271 --> 00:00:30,640
is physical comedy at its finest.

18
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,974
Viñas DeLuxe.

19
00:00:31,974 --> 00:00:33,476
Since you came out on the stage,

20
00:00:33,476 --> 00:00:34,944
it's done, it's over.

21
00:00:34,944 --> 00:00:36,312
Let's pack up.

22
00:00:36,312 --> 00:00:37,180
Yuhua.

23
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:38,514
This is probably my

24
00:00:38,581 --> 00:00:40,249
favorite video of the night.

25
00:00:40,249 --> 00:00:41,684
Viñas DeLuxe,

26
00:00:41,684 --> 00:00:42,285
Brigiding.

27
00:00:42,285 --> 00:00:42,718
Yuhua.

28
00:00:43,019 --> 00:00:44,420
Condragulations.

29
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:47,056
We have a Top 3 this week.

30
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:48,491
Siam Phusri,

31
00:00:48,524 --> 00:00:49,258
Khianna,

32
00:00:49,258 --> 00:00:49,292
Khianna,

33
00:00:49,325 --> 00:00:51,094
you are the Bottom 2 this week.

34
00:00:51,094 --> 00:00:52,195
The time has come,

35
00:00:52,195 --> 00:00:53,796
for you to Lip Sync

36
00:00:53,796 --> 00:00:56,132
for your Legacy!

37
00:00:56,132 --> 00:00:56,833
Yuhua.

38
00:00:56,833 --> 00:00:57,900
Condragulations!

39
00:00:57,934 --> 00:00:59,969
You're a winner, baby!

40
00:01:00,036 --> 00:01:01,904
Which queen have you chosen

41
00:01:02,004 --> 00:01:03,306
to get the karate chop?

42
00:01:03,339 --> 00:01:04,941
The queen that I have chosen,

43
00:01:05,141 --> 00:01:05,775
Siam.

44
00:01:06,642 --> 00:01:07,743
Siam Phusri.

45
00:01:07,777 --> 00:01:09,278
Sashay away.

46
00:01:12,281 --> 00:01:14,584
AAAH!

47
00:01:14,884 --> 00:01:18,121
So this is what it means to be on the fucking top and win?

48
00:01:19,055 --> 00:01:21,591
This is what it fucking means?

49
00:01:21,591 --> 00:01:22,325
Baby,

50
00:01:22,325 --> 00:01:23,993
I am the only international queen

51
00:01:23,993 --> 00:01:24,927
to have a RuBadge.

52
00:01:24,927 --> 00:01:25,728
I feel great.

53
00:01:25,761 --> 00:01:26,662
I feel excited.

54
00:01:26,662 --> 00:01:27,830
I can conquer the world.

55
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:29,999
I could even conquer Slaysian Royale, maybe.

56
00:01:30,766 --> 00:01:33,769
Yuhua eliminating an international girl.

57
00:01:33,769 --> 00:01:36,038
Now we're dwindling to two girls only.

58
00:01:36,072 --> 00:01:36,639
But I mean,

59
00:01:36,672 --> 00:01:38,941
if you follow the track record, it made sense.

60
00:01:39,075 --> 00:01:40,676
Never say goodbye.

61
00:01:40,977 --> 00:01:42,812
Phusri on tonight.

62
00:01:43,179 --> 00:01:44,947
I feel really sad for Siam.

63
00:01:44,947 --> 00:01:46,215
I really want her to stay.

64
00:01:46,215 --> 00:01:48,484
However, I think it's her time and

65
00:01:48,518 --> 00:01:51,053
I commend Yuhua for doing the right thing.

66
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,922
I'm starting to love Yuhua.

67
00:01:53,356 --> 00:01:54,624
In fairness.

68
00:01:54,624 --> 00:01:55,258
Kidding!

69
00:01:55,691 --> 00:01:58,728
Karma bit us back, Yuhua won!

70
00:01:58,728 --> 00:02:00,363
Can you believe that?

71
00:02:00,563 --> 00:02:01,330
Yuhua?

72
00:02:01,697 --> 00:02:02,498
You, huh?

73
00:02:03,366 --> 00:02:04,467
You’re slaying, huh.

74
00:02:04,467 --> 00:02:04,834
Yuhua.

75
00:02:05,034 --> 00:02:05,801
You there?

76
00:02:06,435 --> 00:02:07,270
Fuck you.

77
00:02:08,237 --> 00:02:09,839
Who did the other two voted for?

78
00:02:10,072 --> 00:02:11,607
I chose Siam.

79
00:02:12,008 --> 00:02:12,608
Why?

80
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:14,544
Because of...

81
00:02:14,544 --> 00:02:15,745
the track record.

82
00:02:15,845 --> 00:02:18,781
I can also sense that she's been struggling.

83
00:02:19,081 --> 00:02:20,883
I'm sorry.

84
00:02:20,883 --> 00:02:22,318
I chose Siam also.

85
00:02:22,451 --> 00:02:24,020
You're such a bad actress, bitch.

86
00:02:24,187 --> 00:02:26,088
Yeah, I just chose her because I think

87
00:02:26,088 --> 00:02:27,223
it's her time to go.

88
00:02:27,223 --> 00:02:28,124
Same.

89
00:02:28,357 --> 00:02:30,026
We are in Week 7 already.

90
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:32,061
The competition is getting tougher.

91
00:02:32,161 --> 00:02:33,863
It's not about the strategy anymore,

92
00:02:33,863 --> 00:02:35,731
it's about integrity as well.

93
00:02:35,731 --> 00:02:36,399
And...

94
00:02:36,399 --> 00:02:39,101
Yuhua is a person with integrity,

95
00:02:39,101 --> 00:02:40,336
and I love that for her.

96
00:02:40,369 --> 00:02:41,771
How do you feel, Khianna?

97
00:02:42,104 --> 00:02:43,973
Thank you so much for y’all guys,

98
00:02:43,973 --> 00:02:45,708
because the decisions were...

99
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:46,342
Unanimous.

100
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:47,076
Unanimous.

101
00:02:47,076 --> 00:02:47,743
Thank you so much.

102
00:02:48,044 --> 00:02:50,046
Thank you for believing in me

103
00:02:50,046 --> 00:02:51,380
in my roughest times.

104
00:02:51,547 --> 00:02:52,815
No more second guessing.

105
00:02:52,915 --> 00:02:53,749
Yeah, I'll do my best.

106
00:02:53,783 --> 00:02:54,984
Or should I say, I'll do

107
00:02:54,984 --> 00:02:55,751
the most?

108
00:02:55,851 --> 00:02:57,687
Just need to go up, straightforward,

109
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,122
and just perform my whole heart out.

110
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:03,326
- Yeah. And thank you so much for —
- Oh, my God!

111
00:03:03,326 --> 00:03:05,461
- That was fast.
- Oh, what's that?

112
00:03:05,995 --> 00:03:06,662
Woah!

113
00:03:06,662 --> 00:03:08,030
Oh, my! Oh, my! Oh, my!

114
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:09,765
- Oh, my God.
- Another golden egg!

115
00:03:11,367 --> 00:03:12,468
Girl, we all turned around,

116
00:03:12,468 --> 00:03:14,036
there was a yellow egg over there.

117
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:16,639
I'm like, what the fuck is going on?

118
00:03:16,672 --> 00:03:18,674
Who the hell slipped that there?

119
00:03:18,674 --> 00:03:19,976
I don't know what it means.

120
00:03:21,143 --> 00:03:22,545
There's a golden balut.
(A Filipino delicacy made from fertilized duck eggs)

121
00:03:22,645 --> 00:03:23,779
I know what it is.

122
00:03:24,113 --> 00:03:26,415
I have played this game before.

123
00:03:26,449 --> 00:03:27,717
This is the golden balut.

124
00:03:27,717 --> 00:03:30,386
I can remember seeing this on Season 3.

125
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:31,487
- Oh, my God.
- Right?

126
00:03:31,487 --> 00:03:33,122
I had the golden balut myself.

127
00:03:33,122 --> 00:03:34,991
They saved me from the Bottom 3.

128
00:03:35,024 --> 00:03:37,059
The Golden Balut is very powerful.

129
00:03:37,126 --> 00:03:39,962
It can save someone from the bottom three.

130
00:03:39,996 --> 00:03:41,764
Maybe there's some twists and turns or like

131
00:03:41,797 --> 00:03:42,798
changes up in here.

132
00:03:42,832 --> 00:03:44,267
I really don't know what to expect.

133
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,901
This is Slaysian Royale, girl.

134
00:03:45,901 --> 00:03:47,003
Everything can happen.

135
00:03:47,169 --> 00:03:47,737
Yeah.

136
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:49,405
- Okay, girls.
- It's time to de-drag.

137
00:03:49,405 --> 00:03:50,740
- Let's all rest so we can all
- I want to remove this

138
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:52,908
- work hard.
- hard-ass wig.

139
00:03:53,242 --> 00:03:54,277
You want to remove that

140
00:03:54,277 --> 00:03:55,811
- hard ass wig?
- Yes, you bald-ass bitch.

141
00:03:56,145 --> 00:03:58,648
I'm excited to perform.

142
00:03:58,681 --> 00:04:00,683
I know I'm going to win this.

143
00:04:00,683 --> 00:04:02,585
You know what? I want to...

144
00:04:03,586 --> 00:04:04,253
Yeah.

145
00:04:05,288 --> 00:04:07,523
Explain to me, what's the golden balut again?

146
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:09,725
- The golden—
- I need a clarification.

147
00:04:10,259 --> 00:04:11,193
Because you're...

148
00:04:11,193 --> 00:04:12,261
Okay, I get it.

149
00:04:12,295 --> 00:04:14,597
- You don't get things really fast, so...
- Yes.

150
00:04:14,997 --> 00:04:15,965
What the fuck? Bitch!

151
00:04:22,338 --> 00:04:25,041
The winner of Drag Race Philippines: Slaysian Royale

152
00:04:25,041 --> 00:04:26,375
will receive a one-year supply of

153
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:28,110
Anastasia Beverly Hills Cosmetics.

154
00:04:28,144 --> 00:04:29,245
A coveted spot

155
00:04:29,245 --> 00:04:31,547
on the Drag Race Slaysian Hall of Fame.

156
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:32,848
And a cash prize of

157
00:04:32,848 --> 00:04:34,450
2 Million Pesos!

158
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:35,885
Powered by Bingo Plus.

159
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:38,254
Tonight with our extra special guest judges,

160
00:04:38,354 --> 00:04:39,689
Precious Paula Nicole and

161
00:04:39,689 --> 00:04:41,023
Sasha Colby!

162
00:04:50,066 --> 00:04:51,701
Yes, let's go!

163
00:04:51,734 --> 00:04:52,935
Yes!

164
00:04:52,935 --> 00:04:56,138
Top 6!

165
00:04:56,138 --> 00:04:56,739
Girls!

166
00:04:56,739 --> 00:04:58,307
It's a new day in the Werkroom.

167
00:04:58,307 --> 00:04:58,974
And guess what?

168
00:04:59,008 --> 00:05:02,378
It is a LaLaPaRuza!

169
00:05:02,478 --> 00:05:04,980
And Slaysian Royale rules are suspended.

170
00:05:05,715 --> 00:05:08,250
The Bottom 2 have to lip sync.

171
00:05:08,818 --> 00:05:10,619
Oh, I hope it's not me.

172
00:05:10,686 --> 00:05:11,887
You got the RuBadge.

173
00:05:11,921 --> 00:05:13,389
- I got my RuBadge.
- Yeah!

174
00:05:13,389 --> 00:05:14,223
You got the RuBadge.

175
00:05:14,223 --> 00:05:15,257
- My RuBadge.
- Congratulations!

176
00:05:15,257 --> 00:05:17,560
Am I the only one who doesn't have a RuBadge?

177
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:18,728
Huh?

178
00:05:18,828 --> 00:05:19,462
Huh?

179
00:05:19,562 --> 00:05:21,263
You don't have a RuBadge?

180
00:05:21,263 --> 00:05:22,565
Did you steal mine?

181
00:05:22,698 --> 00:05:24,200
Oh, don't touch it!

182
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:24,934
She has two!

183
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,669
- You have two?!
- Yeah, you can give her one.

184
00:05:26,669 --> 00:05:27,970
It doesn't make sense.

185
00:05:28,204 --> 00:05:30,306
I wanted to be the first international girl to have a win.

186
00:05:30,339 --> 00:05:31,640
I'm happy for Yuhua.

187
00:05:31,707 --> 00:05:33,342
But the next one has to be mine.

188
00:05:33,342 --> 00:05:34,610
I have to prove myself.

189
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:35,878
This is a competition.

190
00:05:35,945 --> 00:05:37,079
Khianna, how are you?

191
00:05:37,113 --> 00:05:38,881
Yeah, I'm feeling a lot better.

192
00:05:38,881 --> 00:05:40,416
- I'm more motivated.
- Good.

193
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:41,417
And...

194
00:05:41,417 --> 00:05:43,152
I just wanted to say I'm sorry

195
00:05:43,185 --> 00:05:44,620
because...

196
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:45,488
I gave up.

197
00:05:45,488 --> 00:05:46,555
But this time,

198
00:05:46,722 --> 00:05:47,890
I’m sorry again because

199
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:49,592
I'm sending y’all guys home.

200
00:05:49,859 --> 00:05:51,193
- You sure about that?
- Oooh.

201
00:05:52,461 --> 00:05:53,596
She's back.

202
00:05:53,763 --> 00:05:55,998
Khianna is all about performing.

203
00:05:56,165 --> 00:05:57,333
If no one's gonna tell it,

204
00:05:57,366 --> 00:05:59,168
I'm gonna tell it myself that

205
00:05:59,235 --> 00:06:00,469
I'm born to do drag

206
00:06:00,469 --> 00:06:01,771
or I'm born to be a star.

207
00:06:02,405 --> 00:06:03,339
OH!!!

208
00:06:03,606 --> 00:06:04,974
Ooh, girl.

209
00:06:05,341 --> 00:06:08,277
She done already done had herses.

210
00:06:08,778 --> 00:06:10,379
My lip sync assassins.

211
00:06:10,413 --> 00:06:13,182
Drag may not be a contact sport,

212
00:06:13,182 --> 00:06:14,116
but tonight,

213
00:06:14,116 --> 00:06:15,851
it's a battle royale.

214
00:06:15,851 --> 00:06:17,253
The stakes are high,

215
00:06:17,253 --> 00:06:18,554
the pressure's on,

216
00:06:18,587 --> 00:06:22,525
and only the most egg-cellent will crack the competition.

217
00:06:22,525 --> 00:06:23,025
Oh!

218
00:06:23,025 --> 00:06:24,727
So let the crack down,

219
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,461
I mean...

220
00:06:25,694 --> 00:06:27,062
Smackdown

221
00:06:27,096 --> 00:06:27,797
begin!

222
00:06:29,765 --> 00:06:31,467
- Oh!
- Oh, my God.

223
00:06:31,467 --> 00:06:32,401
Oh, okay.

224
00:06:32,768 --> 00:06:34,637
Haller! Haller! Haller!

225
00:06:35,538 --> 00:06:37,139
Mama Pao!

226
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:40,009
- Mama Pao! Mama Pao!
- Hi, Queens!

227
00:06:40,042 --> 00:06:41,143
My Queens.

228
00:06:41,143 --> 00:06:41,944
How are you?

229
00:06:42,077 --> 00:06:43,979
Good!

230
00:06:43,979 --> 00:06:44,513
- Grrr!
- Ooh.

231
00:06:44,914 --> 00:06:46,749
Ooh. Lots of RuBadges.

232
00:06:49,018 --> 00:06:50,085
- Don’t touch.
- Well.

233
00:06:50,085 --> 00:06:51,954
No one can predict the future, my Queens.

234
00:06:51,954 --> 00:06:53,589
Not even the winning queen

235
00:06:53,589 --> 00:06:54,924
of the first season

236
00:06:54,924 --> 00:06:56,559
of the Slaysian Royale.

237
00:06:56,592 --> 00:06:58,327
But one thing we can predict

238
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,796
is just how bitchy you girls are.

239
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:02,565
And my guess is very, very much.

240
00:07:02,565 --> 00:07:03,432
You're all bitchy.

241
00:07:03,432 --> 00:07:06,035
You've already proven that you're all shady queens,

242
00:07:06,168 --> 00:07:07,736
surreptitiously salty.

243
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:11,440
SURREPTITIOUSLY SALTY?!

244
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:13,042
For this week's Mini Challenge,

245
00:07:13,075 --> 00:07:14,410
the library is...

246
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:16,679
- open!
- Ohhh!

247
00:07:16,679 --> 00:07:18,914
And that's not the only thing that's open.

248
00:07:18,914 --> 00:07:20,249
- No, not your flies.
- My zipper?

249
00:07:20,282 --> 00:07:23,686
Your third eye is already open as well.

250
00:07:23,686 --> 00:07:24,687
What do I mean?

251
00:07:24,753 --> 00:07:26,322
Oh, Pit Crew!

252
00:07:26,455 --> 00:07:29,291
Ohhh.

253
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:31,427
This isn't just a reading challenge.

254
00:07:31,427 --> 00:07:33,229
It is a Reading-the-Future

255
00:07:33,229 --> 00:07:35,798
- Reading Challenge.
- Oh.

256
00:07:36,031 --> 00:07:37,766
You'll be predicting the future,

257
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,401
the fates of your fellow queens,

258
00:07:39,435 --> 00:07:40,803
but not just in the competition,

259
00:07:40,803 --> 00:07:42,271
but in life itself.

260
00:07:42,271 --> 00:07:43,739
The shadier the prophecy,

261
00:07:43,772 --> 00:07:44,974
the better the tea.

262
00:07:44,974 --> 00:07:46,742
It's harder, but you know what?

263
00:07:46,742 --> 00:07:48,077
This is Slaysian Royale.

264
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:49,678
Everything has to be hard.

265
00:07:49,712 --> 00:07:50,679
Right? Even I'm hard.

266
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:51,347
Kidding!

267
00:07:51,614 --> 00:07:53,749
Let's get mythical and shady,

268
00:07:53,749 --> 00:07:54,917
darlings!

269
00:07:54,917 --> 00:07:57,253
Alright, first up. Yuhua.

270
00:07:59,455 --> 00:08:03,092
Brigiding, Brigiding, Brigiding, Brigiding.

271
00:08:03,092 --> 00:08:04,894
After that kiss with Suki,

272
00:08:04,927 --> 00:08:06,562
I see you in the future,

273
00:08:06,562 --> 00:08:08,430
getting a shot of Penicillin.

274
00:08:09,632 --> 00:08:10,733
I see...

275
00:08:10,733 --> 00:08:12,501
Is that Marina Summers?

276
00:08:12,535 --> 00:08:14,069
I get to read Marina Summers?

277
00:08:14,069 --> 00:08:15,170
Oh, it's just Khianna.

278
00:08:15,204 --> 00:08:15,938
Oh, wait.

279
00:08:15,938 --> 00:08:17,339
It's just Arizona.

280
00:08:17,339 --> 00:08:18,541
Nevermind.

281
00:08:18,774 --> 00:08:19,508
Khianna!

282
00:08:19,675 --> 00:08:20,509
I forgot about Khianna.

283
00:08:20,576 --> 00:08:21,043
Oh, wait.

284
00:08:21,043 --> 00:08:21,744
It's okay.

285
00:08:21,744 --> 00:08:23,412
The judges have forgotten about her too.

286
00:08:23,479 --> 00:08:25,848
Ohhh!

287
00:08:25,848 --> 00:08:26,749
Viñas.

288
00:08:26,782 --> 00:08:28,651
Yuhua...

289
00:08:28,651 --> 00:08:30,986
I can see here that one day

290
00:08:30,986 --> 00:08:31,921
you will realize

291
00:08:31,921 --> 00:08:34,790
that the food of our security officers

292
00:08:34,957 --> 00:08:36,592
is not for you to eat.

293
00:08:36,725 --> 00:08:38,861
- Yuhua?
- How is that funny?

294
00:08:39,962 --> 00:08:40,996
You have food!

295
00:08:41,297 --> 00:08:44,700
Okay, Khianna with a K!

296
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:47,369
Oh, my God. I'm so excited for your future!

297
00:08:47,636 --> 00:08:49,538
Because finally, you will realize that

298
00:08:49,572 --> 00:08:51,240
K is not a brand.

299
00:08:51,373 --> 00:08:51,540
Oh!

300
00:08:51,974 --> 00:08:53,208
You know what's a brand?

301
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:53,609
What?

302
00:08:53,609 --> 00:08:54,944
It's P...

303
00:08:55,177 --> 00:08:55,811
Polident.

304
00:08:55,811 --> 00:08:56,378
Kidding!

305
00:08:56,545 --> 00:08:58,447
What the fuck?

306
00:08:59,949 --> 00:09:00,516
Savage!

307
00:09:03,719 --> 00:09:04,620
You good?

308
00:09:05,287 --> 00:09:06,322
That's it?

309
00:09:07,022 --> 00:09:08,691
This is remastered.

310
00:09:09,258 --> 00:09:12,361
And Suki Doll, of course, Mother Doll.

311
00:09:12,394 --> 00:09:14,763
Your clothes are very stunning.

312
00:09:14,763 --> 00:09:16,131
Yes, they're very stunning

313
00:09:16,131 --> 00:09:17,600
when worn by others.

314
00:09:18,334 --> 00:09:19,335
Oooh.

315
00:09:19,568 --> 00:09:21,904
Is she visually impaired?

316
00:09:21,971 --> 00:09:23,072
Suki Doll.

317
00:09:23,105 --> 00:09:23,872
Ohhh.

318
00:09:23,872 --> 00:09:26,208
The big ball is speaking to me.

319
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:27,209
Silence!

320
00:09:27,309 --> 00:09:28,811
Arizona Brandy.

321
00:09:28,844 --> 00:09:31,780
I see in the future you're even more eco-friendly.

322
00:09:31,814 --> 00:09:33,382
Reused, recycled,

323
00:09:33,382 --> 00:09:34,717
and to be replaced.

324
00:09:35,384 --> 00:09:36,919
Brigiding!

325
00:09:36,919 --> 00:09:39,154
I see a picture of you in the future.

326
00:09:39,254 --> 00:09:41,156
Oh, you let that hair grow!

327
00:09:41,156 --> 00:09:42,825
It's beautiful. I love it.

328
00:09:42,992 --> 00:09:45,027
How did you get it out your nose like that?

329
00:09:46,161 --> 00:09:48,397
Oh, Viñas, my daughter.

330
00:09:48,397 --> 00:09:51,033
You are still wearing outfits that's giving

331
00:09:51,066 --> 00:09:52,534
DDIY.

332
00:09:52,835 --> 00:09:55,037
Don't. Do. It. Yourself!

333
00:09:55,204 --> 00:09:57,673
Leave it to the professionals.

334
00:09:58,674 --> 00:09:59,575
Yuhua.

335
00:09:59,575 --> 00:10:00,509
In four years,

336
00:10:00,542 --> 00:10:02,811
God still hasn't saved America.

337
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:04,346
And you will be the reminder

338
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:06,548
of why we hate Americans.

339
00:10:06,548 --> 00:10:08,484
Yeah!

340
00:10:08,484 --> 00:10:09,518
That was good!

341
00:10:09,518 --> 00:10:12,021
- Oh, sorry.
- Khianna, with a capital K.

342
00:10:12,221 --> 00:10:13,989
Brigiding, Brigiding, Brigiding.

343
00:10:14,023 --> 00:10:15,724
Your future is bright,

344
00:10:15,758 --> 00:10:17,793
but those nipples are dark.

345
00:10:19,128 --> 00:10:21,196
- Dark nipples!
- You want to lick it?

346
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:22,031
You want to lick it?

347
00:10:22,231 --> 00:10:23,732
At least only my nipples are dark.

348
00:10:23,732 --> 00:10:25,067
Can't say the same for her ass.

349
00:10:25,067 --> 00:10:26,502
Dirty, smelly,

350
00:10:26,502 --> 00:10:27,670
filthy as mud.

351
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:29,672
It already goes through so much shit,

352
00:10:29,672 --> 00:10:31,273
and it looks like shit, too.

353
00:10:31,273 --> 00:10:32,875
Viñas DeLuxe.

354
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:33,776
You

355
00:10:33,776 --> 00:10:34,843
are gonna win

356
00:10:34,843 --> 00:10:37,246
in That's My Tomboy, Season 3.
(A popular talent competition for lesbians)

357
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,115
Let's just play Tong-its.
(A Filipino card game)

358
00:10:40,115 --> 00:10:40,816
Brigiding.

359
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:43,052
Viñas DeLuxe, Sis.

360
00:10:43,218 --> 00:10:44,486
You will be awarded

361
00:10:44,586 --> 00:10:47,790
as the National Mouth of the Philippines.

362
00:10:47,823 --> 00:10:49,158
In Filipino,

363
00:10:49,158 --> 00:10:51,126
Boo. Flop.

364
00:11:00,035 --> 00:11:01,770
Khianna with a K.

365
00:11:01,804 --> 00:11:05,107
You need to change your name to Khianna with KSP.

366
00:11:05,107 --> 00:11:06,642
Known for Seeking Praise,

367
00:11:06,642 --> 00:11:07,609
and Partial Dentures,

368
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:09,311
Keeps Seeking Parents.

369
00:11:09,311 --> 00:11:10,846
Awww.

370
00:11:10,846 --> 00:11:14,383
- Aww, no parents.
- How can you joke about that? Fucker.

371
00:11:14,383 --> 00:11:15,651
I'm not going to laugh.

372
00:11:16,618 --> 00:11:18,854
So we're getting personal now, Sis, huh?

373
00:11:19,254 --> 00:11:19,922
It's okay.

374
00:11:19,922 --> 00:11:21,824
Maybe KSP is just what Brigiding is too.

375
00:11:21,824 --> 00:11:23,625
Knock Still Pending.

376
00:11:24,259 --> 00:11:25,461
I'll knock some sense into her head.

377
00:11:26,261 --> 00:11:27,463
Arizona Brandy.

378
00:11:27,463 --> 00:11:28,764
Viñas DeLuxe.

379
00:11:28,797 --> 00:11:31,266
Award-winning singer,

380
00:11:31,266 --> 00:11:32,534
dancer,

381
00:11:32,568 --> 00:11:34,169
choreographer.

382
00:11:34,403 --> 00:11:35,771
This isn't you.

383
00:11:35,771 --> 00:11:37,106
Who the fuck is it then?

384
00:11:37,372 --> 00:11:38,640
Who's that?

385
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,875
Okay, Brigiding.

386
00:11:39,908 --> 00:11:42,010
In the future I can see you getting bit

387
00:11:42,044 --> 00:11:43,645
by Captivating Katkat

388
00:11:43,645 --> 00:11:44,947
because you look like a penis.

389
00:11:46,749 --> 00:11:47,616
Boo! Flop!

390
00:11:47,616 --> 00:11:51,954
Boo! Flop flop flop.

391
00:11:51,954 --> 00:11:54,556
And as I predicted, you are all a bunch of

392
00:11:54,556 --> 00:11:56,125
whore-racles!

393
00:11:56,391 --> 00:12:00,395
But only one of you is the best misfortune teller of all.

394
00:12:00,429 --> 00:12:03,265
Our Miss Fortune is...

395
00:12:04,466 --> 00:12:06,802
Suki Doll!

396
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:10,139
Condragulations, Suki Doll!

397
00:12:10,139 --> 00:12:12,107
You won a cash tip of 20,000 pesos

398
00:12:12,107 --> 00:12:14,743
and an advantage for our main challenge

399
00:12:14,743 --> 00:12:16,245
- Advantage?
- to be revealed later.

400
00:12:16,245 --> 00:12:18,046
Oh, my God!

401
00:12:18,046 --> 00:12:19,515
I might be congenial,

402
00:12:19,515 --> 00:12:21,683
but I have a thing or two to say about everyone

403
00:12:21,683 --> 00:12:23,285
and I'll let them know it.

404
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:24,920
Now let's get back to the present,

405
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,088
because today,

406
00:12:26,088 --> 00:12:27,322
we are doing the very first

407
00:12:27,356 --> 00:12:32,027

- Ooh.

413
00:12:41,236 --> 00:12:43,839
Oh, my gosh, I'm so scared!

414
00:12:43,872 --> 00:12:46,642
Because I know how to perform, but,

415
00:12:46,642 --> 00:12:50,112
I know how my competitions perform as well.

416
00:12:50,112 --> 00:12:52,114
Now show me how you slay, Queens.

417
00:12:52,114 --> 00:12:54,116
And later on, in the judging panel,

418
00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:56,819
we'll be joined by our extra special guest judge,

419
00:12:56,852 --> 00:12:58,720
Drag Race Philippines' first-ever winner,

420

Precious Paula Nicole.

421
00:13:02,124 --> 00:13:03,392
Oh, my God.

422
00:13:03,425 --> 00:13:06,461
The Pressure Paula Nicole herself.

423
00:13:06,461 --> 00:13:06,929
Let's go!

424
00:13:06,929 --> 00:13:09,898
I’m so happy that she'll be in the judging panel.

425
00:13:10,365 --> 00:13:11,667
I'm so excited.

426
00:13:12,334 --> 00:13:12,868
And...

427
00:13:12,868 --> 00:13:15,437
RuPaul's Drag Race, Season 15 Winner.

428
00:13:15,437 --> 00:13:18,240

00:13:21,376 --> 00:13:22,911
I love Sasha Colby.

431
00:13:22,911 --> 00:13:25,314
I think Sasha Colby is the epitome

432
00:13:25,314 --> 00:13:27,182
of being a great performer.

433
00:13:27,349 --> 00:13:29,284
#SlaysianRoyale

434
00:13:29,284 --> 00:13:29,985
Yaaas!

See you on the Main Stage, Queens.

436
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:32,921
Good luck, and don't

437
00:13:32,921 --> 00:13:34,389
fuck it up!

438
00:13:34,389 --> 00:13:35,557
Bye, Queens. See you later!

439
00:13:35,557 --> 00:13:36,692
- Oh, my God!
- Bye!

440
00:13:37,259 --> 00:13:38,493
This is going to be fierce, Sis!

441
00:13:38,694 --> 00:13:40,295
Oh, my God. Bye, Mama Pao!

442
00:14:03,619 --> 00:14:04,820
Mabuheeey!

443
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:06,355
I’m your mothertucking host,

444
00:14:06,388 --> 00:14:07,956

445
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:12,361

447
00:14:13,929 --> 00:14:16,064
my precious,

448
00:14:16,064 --> 00:14:17,532
Precious Paula Nicole.

449
00:14:17,532 --> 00:14:18,133
Tell me,

450
00:14:18,133 --> 00:14:19,835
Are you a lip sync assassin or what?

451
00:14:19,835 --> 00:14:21,503
Your mother is a queen, Mama Pao.

452
00:14:21,503 --> 00:14:23,472
I'm so happy to be here,

453
00:14:23,472 --> 00:14:26,008
and yes, these lips can do a lot of things.

454
00:14:26,008 --> 00:14:27,643
And aside from the things it can do,

455
00:14:27,776 --> 00:14:29,645
it can also bite a lot of things!

456
00:14:29,878 --> 00:14:30,946
Raaah!

457
00:14:30,946 --> 00:14:33,048
What a fierce mouth you have.

458
00:14:34,082 --> 00:14:35,183
Multi-talented.

459
00:14:35,217 --> 00:14:36,518
Speaking of talented,

460
00:14:36,551 --> 00:14:38,720
Winner of RuPaul's Drag Race, Season 15.

461
00:14:38,754 --> 00:14:40,155
The Goddess herself,

462
00:14:40,155 --> 00:14:42,157
Sasha Colby!

463
00:14:42,157 --> 00:14:43,425
Hello, Sasha.

464
00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:45,060
Do you know any Tagalog words?

465
00:14:45,093 --> 00:14:45,994
Yes, Mama Pao.

466
00:14:46,028 --> 00:14:46,962
Good luck.

467
00:14:46,995 --> 00:14:48,497
And don't fuck it up.

468
00:14:48,597 --> 00:14:49,364
Very good.

469
00:14:49,498 --> 00:14:51,066
As a lip sync assassin yourself,

470
00:14:51,233 --> 00:14:53,602
what are you expecting from this LaLaPaRuza?

471
00:14:53,602 --> 00:14:54,970
I'm expecting them to

472
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:56,805
know their words.

473
00:14:56,838 --> 00:15:00,342
You are really the G-O-D-D-E-S-S.

474
00:15:00,342 --> 00:15:01,376
Thank you, Sasha.

475
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:02,844
And tonight the stakes are high,

476
00:15:02,844 --> 00:15:04,346
the wings are secured,

477
00:15:04,346 --> 00:15:05,714
and the claws are out.

478
00:15:05,781 --> 00:15:06,815
Welcome to the ultimate

479
00:15:06,815 --> 00:15:09,084
Lip Sync LaLaPaRuza Slaysian Smackdown!

480
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:10,752
Where only the fiercest will survive

481
00:15:10,752 --> 00:15:11,553
and the rest

482
00:15:11,553 --> 00:15:14,056
will sashay into oblivion.

483
00:15:14,323 --> 00:15:17,426
OBLIVION?!

484
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:18,927
Racers.

485
00:15:18,961 --> 00:15:20,462
Start your engines.

486
00:15:20,462 --> 00:15:23,832
And may the best Slaysian queen win!

487
00:15:26,835 --> 00:15:29,972
Bring back my lip sync assassins.

488
00:15:46,355 --> 00:15:46,989
Queens.

489
00:15:47,022 --> 00:15:50,926
Welcome to Drag Race Philippines: Slaysian Royale's first-ever

490
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:54,863
Lip Sync LaLaPaRuza Slaysian Smackdown!

491
00:15:54,997 --> 00:15:56,365
- Yeah!
- Wooh!

492
00:15:56,365 --> 00:15:58,100
This challenge is a dance-off

493
00:15:58,133 --> 00:15:59,634
through a series of lip syncs,

494
00:15:59,634 --> 00:16:00,769
tournament style.

495
00:16:00,769 --> 00:16:02,771
One queen will be randomly selected

496
00:16:02,771 --> 00:16:04,006
from a tambiolo

497
00:16:04,006 --> 00:16:06,508
containing the names of all the remaining queens.

498
00:16:06,541 --> 00:16:07,976
The queen picked first,

499
00:16:07,976 --> 00:16:10,479
will have the power to choose her lip sync opponent

500
00:16:10,479 --> 00:16:12,014
among her fellow queens.

501
00:16:12,047 --> 00:16:13,648
That chosen queen, in turn,

502
00:16:13,648 --> 00:16:16,385
will have the power to choose their lip sync song

503
00:16:16,385 --> 00:16:18,387
among the choices available.

504
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:20,789
“Goddess” by Sasha Colby.

505
00:16:20,789 --> 00:16:21,957
- Yes!
- Yes!

506
00:16:22,224 --> 00:16:24,092
“Queen” by Silvy.

507
00:16:24,593 --> 00:16:26,928
“Queendom” by RuPaul.

508
00:16:27,362 --> 00:16:30,198
And “Boom, Boom, Boom, Boom” by the Vengaboys.

509
00:16:30,298 --> 00:16:33,101
The losing queen after each lip sync battle

510
00:16:33,135 --> 00:16:35,170
will make her way back to the Werkroom,

511
00:16:35,203 --> 00:16:38,373
while the winning queen remains on the Main Stage.

512
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,508
But wait,

513
00:16:40,175 --> 00:16:41,543
there's more.

514
00:16:41,877 --> 00:16:42,811
Suki Doll.

515
00:16:43,011 --> 00:16:44,046
As promised,

516
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:45,580
as the Mini Challenge winner,

517
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:47,182
you have two advantages.

518
00:16:47,482 --> 00:16:49,584
To choose and to block.

519
00:16:51,253 --> 00:16:54,189
First, you have the ability to block a queen

520
00:16:54,222 --> 00:16:55,524
from choosing their opponent

521
00:16:55,557 --> 00:16:57,459
and song in any round.

522
00:16:58,260 --> 00:16:59,895
So, Suki Doll,

523
00:16:59,928 --> 00:17:02,097
which queen would you choose to block,

524
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:03,098
and why?

525
00:17:04,566 --> 00:17:05,934
Suki has the power

526
00:17:05,967 --> 00:17:07,803
of advantage and disadvantage.

527
00:17:07,836 --> 00:17:09,271
This could flip the script

528
00:17:09,304 --> 00:17:10,439
with the LaLaPaRuza.

529
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:12,941
So I will choose my sister that I know

530
00:17:12,941 --> 00:17:14,910
does so well in this challenge.

531
00:17:19,648 --> 00:17:20,982
Khianna.

532
00:17:22,818 --> 00:17:24,886
With love and sisterhood,

533
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,123
I send to you that disadvantage.

534
00:17:30,158 --> 00:17:31,793
Well damn, I got the disadvantage.

535
00:17:31,827 --> 00:17:33,628
I can't pick a song.

536
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:36,665
I can't pick my lip sync partner either. Okay.

537
00:17:36,932 --> 00:17:39,167
I'll let the universe decide for me.

538
00:17:40,102 --> 00:17:42,204
Khianna, you’re in danger.

539
00:17:43,138 --> 00:17:45,740
Now, let the Lip Sync LaLaPaRuza SmackDown

540
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:47,342
begin!

541
00:17:48,376 --> 00:17:51,079
Lip Sync LaLaPaRuza SmackDown, Round 1.

542
00:17:51,146 --> 00:17:52,380
Suki Doll.

543
00:17:52,414 --> 00:17:55,951
Which queen will you choose to battle against with and why?

544
00:17:55,951 --> 00:17:57,519
I have chosen my sister

545
00:17:57,519 --> 00:17:58,787
that have mentioned to me before

546
00:17:58,787 --> 00:18:00,388
that she wants to lip sync together.

547
00:18:00,388 --> 00:18:02,424
This is gonna be a great moment for us to share

548
00:18:02,424 --> 00:18:03,692
and to bond further.

549
00:18:03,692 --> 00:18:04,960
I have chosen...

550
00:18:07,529 --> 00:18:10,432
Yuhua, as my opponent.

551
00:18:10,432 --> 00:18:11,333
Ohhh.

552
00:18:11,566 --> 00:18:12,501
Suki Doll.

553
00:18:12,567 --> 00:18:14,436
What would you choose as your lip sync song?

554
00:18:14,469 --> 00:18:16,404
I do have a favorite in the group,

555
00:18:16,404 --> 00:18:18,573
and obviously it's from an artist that I respect a lot

556
00:18:18,607 --> 00:18:19,541
and admire a lot.

557
00:18:19,574 --> 00:18:20,842
She's Mother of Mothers.

558
00:18:22,077 --> 00:18:23,712
It's going to be “Goddess” by Sasha.

559
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,014
Oh, wow.

560
00:18:26,014 --> 00:18:27,449
Now, the rest of the queens

561
00:18:27,449 --> 00:18:29,184
may go to the back of the stage.

562
00:18:29,885 --> 00:18:33,421
Suki and Yuhua, assume your position.

563
00:18:37,259 --> 00:18:40,095
Lip Sync LaLaPaRuza Slaysian SmackDown,

564
00:18:40,095 --> 00:18:41,830
Round 1!

565
00:18:41,997 --> 00:18:44,499
Suki Doll versus Yuhua.

566
00:18:44,966 --> 00:18:47,202
Two queens stand before me.

567
00:18:48,203 --> 00:18:49,838
This is your chance to impress me

568
00:18:49,838 --> 00:18:52,774
for another opportunity to slay another day.

569
00:18:53,775 --> 00:18:55,477
The time has come

570
00:18:56,678 --> 00:18:59,181
for you to Lip Sync

571
00:18:59,214 --> 00:19:01,216
for your Life!

572
00:19:03,718 --> 00:19:05,387
Yuhua, you better tigthen your boots

573
00:19:05,387 --> 00:19:07,489
because you are dancing in front of Sasha

574
00:19:07,489 --> 00:19:09,291
for her song with me.

575
00:19:09,324 --> 00:19:10,225
Suki Doll!

576
00:19:10,258 --> 00:19:12,527
This lip sync is from Mama Yuhua, honey.

577
00:19:13,228 --> 00:19:14,596
You think you're the real Mother?

578
00:19:14,596 --> 00:19:15,897
I'm the other Mother.

579
00:19:15,931 --> 00:19:19,067
Good luck, Queens, and don't fuck it up.

580
00:19:19,568 --> 00:19:22,037
G-O-D-D-E-S-S

581
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:23,438
That bitch is a goddess

582
00:19:23,438 --> 00:19:25,874
G-O-D-D-E-S-S

583
00:19:26,107 --> 00:19:27,275
That bitch is a goddess

584
00:19:27,275 --> 00:19:29,544
She's not trying to impress

585
00:19:29,878 --> 00:19:31,213
She's just being honest

586
00:19:31,246 --> 00:19:33,515
G-O-D-D-E-S-S

587
00:19:33,915 --> 00:19:35,150
That bitch is a goddess

588
00:19:35,183 --> 00:19:36,551
That bitch is a goddess

589
00:19:36,585 --> 00:19:38,553
Look at her face and look at her bodice

590
00:19:38,553 --> 00:19:40,388
She a real professional, she ain't no novice

591
00:19:40,388 --> 00:19:41,690
When she need to turn it up, she do

592
00:19:41,723 --> 00:19:42,857
That's a promise, uh

593
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:44,159
That bitch is a diva

594
00:19:44,192 --> 00:19:46,027
She can change her name if she want to Tina

595
00:19:46,027 --> 00:19:48,330
Or maybe when she's wakin' up, she's feeling like Nina

596
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:50,232
Maybe down at Mexico, she go by Margarita

597
00:19:50,265 --> 00:19:50,732
Uh

598
00:19:50,765 --> 00:19:51,733
That bitch is ethereal

599
00:19:51,766 --> 00:19:52,500
And in the best material

600
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,568
She lookin' likе a work of art

601
00:19:53,568 --> 00:19:54,569
And they should make a mur-i-al

602
00:19:54,569 --> 00:19:55,470
She nеver wanna take a break

603
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:56,471
She show up early, never late

604
00:19:56,471 --> 00:19:57,505
And she can take out anyone

605
00:19:57,505 --> 00:19:58,540
But she don't ever instigate

606
00:19:59,441 --> 00:20:02,510
'Cause she's a G-O-D-D-E-S-S

607
00:20:02,744 --> 00:20:04,012
That bitch is a goddess

608
00:20:04,045 --> 00:20:06,314
G-O-D-D-E-S-S

609
00:20:06,548 --> 00:20:07,916
That bitch is a goddess

610
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:10,352
She's not trying to impress

611
00:20:10,552 --> 00:20:11,853
She's just being honest

612
00:20:11,886 --> 00:20:14,222
G-O-D-D-E-S-S

613
00:20:14,456 --> 00:20:15,757
That bitch is a goddess

614
00:20:15,991 --> 00:20:18,159
G-O-D-D-E-S-S

615
00:20:19,661 --> 00:20:21,963
G-O-D-D-E-S-S

616
00:20:23,531 --> 00:20:24,532
G-O-D-D-E-S-S

617
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,635
G-O-D-D-E-S-S

618
00:20:27,435 --> 00:20:30,105
G-O-D-D-E-S-S (Oh)

619
00:20:30,138 --> 00:20:31,373
That bitch is a goddess
(That bitch is a goddess)

620
00:20:31,406 --> 00:20:33,575
G-O-D-D-E-S-S (Oh)

621
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:35,210
That bitch is a goddess
(That bitch is a goddess)

622
00:20:35,243 --> 00:20:37,679
She's not trying to impress
(Trying to impress)

623
00:20:37,879 --> 00:20:39,180
She's just being honest

624
00:20:39,214 --> 00:20:41,449
G-O-D-D-E-S-S (Oh)

625
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:43,918
That bitch is a goddess
(That bitch is a goddess)

626
00:20:44,152 --> 00:20:45,987
- Eyyy!
- Wooh!

627
00:20:51,226 --> 00:20:52,560
Sasha, what can you say about

628
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,262
that Slaysian Smackdown?

629
00:20:54,629 --> 00:20:55,897
It was...

630
00:20:55,897 --> 00:20:58,833
the perfect way to start off this LaLaPaRuza.

631
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,669
I thought the energy was so high level.

632
00:21:00,702 --> 00:21:02,137
I know both of you from

633
00:21:02,137 --> 00:21:04,005
watching your respective seasons.

634
00:21:04,039 --> 00:21:07,409
And I know Suki's going to come with the fashion and the style,

635
00:21:07,442 --> 00:21:09,010
and Yuhua is going to come with

636
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:10,645
the camp and all the levels.

637
00:21:10,712 --> 00:21:12,314
The only real thing I could really say is

638
00:21:12,314 --> 00:21:13,214
not even a critique,

639
00:21:13,214 --> 00:21:15,684
but I just know how hard this song is to lip sync.

640
00:21:15,717 --> 00:21:17,252
And you all did like

641
00:21:17,252 --> 00:21:18,787
your perfect best, and I

642
00:21:18,787 --> 00:21:20,855
applaud that because it is a hard song.

643
00:21:20,855 --> 00:21:21,656
Yes.

644
00:21:21,823 --> 00:21:22,957
Thank you, Sasha.

645
00:21:22,991 --> 00:21:24,759
And thank you for that hard song.

646
00:21:24,826 --> 00:21:26,661
Ooh, I love a hard song.

647
00:21:26,861 --> 00:21:27,762
Ooh.

648
00:21:28,029 --> 00:21:29,331
Ladies.

649
00:21:29,331 --> 00:21:31,533
I have made my decision.

650
00:21:34,602 --> 00:21:35,804
Suki Doll.

651
00:21:37,305 --> 00:21:38,807
Shantay, you stay.

652
00:21:39,007 --> 00:21:39,507
Yes!

653
00:21:39,507 --> 00:21:42,177
You may go to the back of the stage, thank you.

654
00:21:44,312 --> 00:21:46,648
Yeah, I just got what I wanted.

655
00:21:46,648 --> 00:21:48,583
I just won in front of Sasha.

656
00:21:48,583 --> 00:21:50,018
And with Yuhua,

657
00:21:50,051 --> 00:21:51,386
I love you girl, but,

658
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,555
you got to go.

659
00:21:53,688 --> 00:21:55,423
Suki Doll really won

660
00:21:55,423 --> 00:21:57,492
and of course she deserves it.

661
00:22:02,397 --> 00:22:03,565
Yuhua.

662
00:22:03,598 --> 00:22:04,432
- Yes.
- Don't worry.

663
00:22:04,466 --> 00:22:06,835
You still have a chance to redeem yourself.

664
00:22:06,868 --> 00:22:07,435
- Yes.
- Okay.

665
00:22:07,469 --> 00:22:09,404
But for now, please go back to the Werkroom.

666
00:22:10,839 --> 00:22:11,840
Why?

667
00:22:11,873 --> 00:22:13,842
Fuck you, bitch.

668
00:22:13,842 --> 00:22:15,276
Fuck you!

669
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:16,111
Look at this.

670
00:22:16,144 --> 00:22:16,644
Yes!

671
00:22:16,678 --> 00:22:18,580
Suck this, motherfucker.

672
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:19,347
See you all soon!

673
00:22:19,381 --> 00:22:20,448
See you soon.

674
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:23,852
Oh, my God!

675
00:22:23,852 --> 00:22:27,856
I'm the first one in, but not too bad, baby.

676
00:22:27,889 --> 00:22:29,891
I get to watch

677
00:22:29,924 --> 00:22:31,960
the rest of the show?!

678
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:34,963
It sucks to be the first one to lose the LaLaPaRuza,

679
00:22:34,963 --> 00:22:35,997
but I'm okay with it.

680
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:37,766
There's still a second chance for me

681
00:22:37,766 --> 00:22:38,833
to redeem myself.

682
00:22:39,534 --> 00:22:41,803
Bring on the show, girls!

683
00:22:42,303 --> 00:22:45,507
It's time for Lip Sync LaLaPaRuza Slaysian Smackdown,

684
00:22:45,507 --> 00:22:47,041
Round 2!

685
00:22:47,242 --> 00:22:48,309
Oh, Pit Crew.

686
00:22:48,343 --> 00:22:51,045
Show us your ball, right now!

687
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:53,715
- Wooh!
- Yes!

688
00:23:01,589 --> 00:23:02,524
Brigiding.

689
00:23:02,924 --> 00:23:04,826
It's your turn to lip sync.

690
00:23:10,098 --> 00:23:14,169
Who will you choose to compete against and why?

691
00:23:14,969 --> 00:23:16,938
I want to share

692
00:23:17,005 --> 00:23:18,873
an iconic performance with

693
00:23:18,873 --> 00:23:20,175
my lovely sister.

694
00:23:20,742 --> 00:23:23,445
And I want to have that moment while

695
00:23:23,445 --> 00:23:26,114
one of our sisters here is watching us as well,

696
00:23:26,114 --> 00:23:27,282
Precious Paula Nicole.

697
00:23:27,449 --> 00:23:29,717
I want to battle it out with Viñas DeLuxe.

698
00:23:29,717 --> 00:23:30,084
Eyyy!

699
00:23:30,084 --> 00:23:31,052
You're so annoying!

700
00:23:32,987 --> 00:23:36,090
Oh, my God, Viñas?!

701
00:23:36,257 --> 00:23:38,693
Oh. They're such cool sisters.

702
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:40,695
They've known each other for over 10 years.

703
00:23:40,695 --> 00:23:42,964
So let's see how this is gonna go down.

704
00:23:43,131 --> 00:23:45,200
What lip sync song will you choose?

705
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,735
Will it be “Queen” by Silvy,

706
00:23:47,836 --> 00:23:49,604
“Queendom” by RuPaul

707
00:23:49,671 --> 00:23:52,140
or “Boom, Boom, Boom, Boom” by the Vengaboys?

708
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,042
I'm gonna choose

709
00:23:54,442 --> 00:23:56,544
“Queendom” by Mother Ru.

710
00:23:56,611 --> 00:23:58,847
- Yes!
- Yay!

711
00:23:58,847 --> 00:24:00,682
Any last words

712
00:24:00,682 --> 00:24:02,450
for your opponent?

713
00:24:03,685 --> 00:24:05,086
Good luck to us, Sis.

714
00:24:05,153 --> 00:24:06,488
- We got this.
- Please don't kiss me, Sis!

715
00:24:06,488 --> 00:24:06,855
Kidding!

716
00:24:06,988 --> 00:24:08,089
Just give this to me.

717
00:24:10,492 --> 00:24:12,627
Are you feeling pressured that your sister,

718
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:14,362
Precious Paula Nicole is here?

719
00:24:14,362 --> 00:24:15,196
Yes. Like.

720
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:16,331
Pressure Paula Nicole.

721
00:24:16,364 --> 00:24:17,832
Pressure Paula Nicole.

722
00:24:17,966 --> 00:24:18,800
Alright.

723
00:24:20,134 --> 00:24:23,738
Lip Sync LaLaPaRuza Slaysian Smackdown, Round 2!

724
00:24:24,572 --> 00:24:27,408
Brigiding versus Viñas DeLuxe.

725
00:24:27,442 --> 00:24:27,809
Wooh!

726
00:24:28,209 --> 00:24:29,577
Two queens stand before me.

727
00:24:31,079 --> 00:24:32,514
This is your chance to impress me

728
00:24:32,514 --> 00:24:34,148
and save yourself from elimination.

729
00:24:35,316 --> 00:24:36,384
The time has come

730
00:24:37,318 --> 00:24:38,686
for you to Lip Sync

731
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,022
for your Life!

732
00:24:43,258 --> 00:24:45,527
Looks like my sister wants to prove something.

733
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,161
Go, bring it on.

734
00:24:47,195 --> 00:24:48,363
Bring it on, darling.

735
00:24:48,696 --> 00:24:51,299
Good luck, and don't fuck it up.

736
00:24:51,499 --> 00:24:53,034
Sister, I think...

737
00:24:53,067 --> 00:24:55,737
I know you are a very fierce performer,

738
00:24:55,803 --> 00:24:57,405
but I think this one is mine

739
00:24:57,405 --> 00:24:59,607
because I am the Queen of the Queendom.

740
00:25:01,843 --> 00:25:03,845
(Hold up) Who got the keys to the queendom?

741
00:25:03,912 --> 00:25:05,880
(What?) Who got the keys to the queendom?

742
00:25:05,914 --> 00:25:07,549
(Oh) We got the keys to the queendom

743
00:25:07,549 --> 00:25:09,584
I heard she tryna shade, but really, I don't see her

744
00:25:09,584 --> 00:25:11,452
(Hold up) Who got the keys to the queendom?

745
00:25:11,452 --> 00:25:13,421
(What?) Who got the keys to the queendom?

746
00:25:13,421 --> 00:25:15,089
(Oh) We got the keys to the queendom

747
00:25:15,089 --> 00:25:17,025
I heard she tryna shade, but really, I don't see her

748
00:25:17,025 --> 00:25:18,526
I used to play ball like a girl

749
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,395
Now I slay ballroom floors across the world

750
00:25:20,395 --> 00:25:22,297
Shame to waste talent, and all of this nerve

751
00:25:22,297 --> 00:25:24,532
Unique, charismatic, my calling is to serve

752
00:25:24,599 --> 00:25:26,267
I used to play ball likе a girl

753
00:25:26,301 --> 00:25:28,202
Now I slay ballroom floors across the world

754
00:25:28,202 --> 00:25:30,071
Shame to waste talеnt, and all of this nerve

755
00:25:30,071 --> 00:25:32,073
Unique, charismatic, my calling is to serve

756
00:25:32,073 --> 00:25:33,741
Daddy didn't like when I'm feminine cunt

757
00:25:33,808 --> 00:25:35,677
But I got a, got a right to give the people what they want

Turns out they wanna work it, walk and talk and watch me

Work it, walk and talk and watch me

765
00:25:51,993 --> 00:25:53,828
Work it, walk and talk and watch me

766
00:25:53,895 --> 00:25:55,463

YES!

820
00:28:02,023 --> 00:28:04,025
Go, Queens, go!

821
00:28:04,659 --> 00:28:05,727
Fuck, y’all slayed!

822
00:28:05,727 --> 00:28:06,894
You both fucking slayed!

823
00:28:08,029 --> 00:28:10,231
Yaaas!

824
00:28:10,231 --> 00:28:13,468
Those are my Slaysian sisters.

825
00:28:13,501 --> 00:28:15,336
Oh, my God!

826
00:28:15,837 --> 00:28:16,804
Precious.

827
00:28:17,038 --> 00:28:20,007
How did you find that Slaysian Smackdown?

828
00:28:20,108 --> 00:28:21,776
Mama Pao, I want to be honest.

829
00:28:21,809 --> 00:28:22,710
Oh, what?

830
00:28:22,744 --> 00:28:24,312
I’m very disappointed.

831
00:28:24,345 --> 00:28:24,879
What?

832
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,347
Why?

833
00:28:27,515 --> 00:28:29,484
- Just kidding!
- Oh, how dare you.

834
00:28:29,884 --> 00:28:31,285
All I can say is wow.

835
00:28:31,285 --> 00:28:31,686
Wow.

836
00:28:32,253 --> 00:28:34,088
You took us on a thrilling ride.

837
00:28:34,088 --> 00:28:35,256
And you enjoyed yourselves as well.

838
00:28:35,289 --> 00:28:36,724
- Yes.
- You know the words,

839
00:28:36,724 --> 00:28:38,159
you had fun,

840
00:28:38,192 --> 00:28:39,093
and you owned the song.

841
00:28:39,093 --> 00:28:39,861
That’s why...

842
00:28:39,927 --> 00:28:41,496
I'm very, very proud to call

843
00:28:41,496 --> 00:28:42,697
both of you my sisters.

844
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:44,932
- Thank you.
- And condragulations.

845
00:28:44,932 --> 00:28:45,566
That's all.

846
00:28:46,834 --> 00:28:48,236
Ladies,

847
00:28:48,536 --> 00:28:50,104
I have made my decision.

848
00:28:54,275 --> 00:28:55,243
Brigiding.

849
00:28:58,079 --> 00:28:59,213
Shantay, you stay.

850
00:29:01,616 --> 00:29:03,217
You are free to slay another day.

851
00:29:03,217 --> 00:29:06,187
You may go back to the back of the stage.

852
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:07,455
My sister really deserves it

853
00:29:07,455 --> 00:29:11,025
because she really is a great Drag Queen ever since

854
00:29:11,025 --> 00:29:13,060
and she will never have fans admiring her a lot

855
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:14,195
if she’s not a good performer.

856
00:29:15,563 --> 00:29:16,798
It's so hard.

857
00:29:18,366 --> 00:29:18,866
Let me get that.

858
00:29:18,866 --> 00:29:21,969
Viñas DeLuxe, you'll have another chance to prove yourself later.

859
00:29:22,403 --> 00:29:24,572
But for now, please go back to the Werkroom.

860
00:29:27,575 --> 00:29:30,378
- Good job!
- Thank you, Sis.

861
00:29:33,815 --> 00:29:35,783
I don't want to know who it is.

862
00:29:36,117 --> 00:29:37,552
Don't say anything.

863
00:29:37,552 --> 00:29:39,420
If you can hear my voice,

864
00:29:39,854 --> 00:29:42,690
I want to be surprised when you sit next to me.

865
00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:43,925
Let me feel your hand.

866
00:29:44,058 --> 00:29:46,027
Okay. It's very soft.

867
00:29:47,228 --> 00:29:48,296
Okay. It's a little bit

868
00:29:48,496 --> 00:29:49,964
chubby so I feel like it's Viñas.

869
00:29:49,964 --> 00:29:50,364
Okay...

870
00:29:50,798 --> 00:29:51,833
Fuck you!

871
00:29:51,866 --> 00:29:52,867
What do you mean chubby?

872
00:29:52,867 --> 00:29:54,802
- I'm not chubby.
- No, you're not chubby, baby.

873
00:29:54,802 --> 00:29:55,636
You did so well.

874
00:29:55,636 --> 00:29:56,771
I thought you were going to win the lip sync

875
00:29:56,771 --> 00:29:58,973
because they love like gimmicks and surprises.

876
00:29:59,006 --> 00:30:00,608
- Ah, you saw it?
- I saw it.

877
00:30:00,608 --> 00:30:02,310
You were playing with the cameras and stuff.

878
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:03,177
You did so great.

879
00:30:03,177 --> 00:30:05,079
- It's okay.
- It's okay?

880
00:30:05,112 --> 00:30:07,114
I mean, I'm happy with the performance.

881
00:30:07,114 --> 00:30:08,749
I didn't know also who

882
00:30:08,749 --> 00:30:10,718
deserves to stay, but...

883
00:30:11,018 --> 00:30:12,620
I know I'm going to stay.

884
00:30:14,789 --> 00:30:19,660
Are you ready for your Lip Sync LaLaPaRuza Smackdown, Round 3?

885
00:30:20,027 --> 00:30:21,929
Arizona Brandy and Khianna.

886
00:30:21,963 --> 00:30:24,432
You are the remaining queens.

887
00:30:25,132 --> 00:30:27,935
I really want to do a lip sync battle with Khianna,

888
00:30:27,935 --> 00:30:29,370
my biggest competition,

889
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:30,638
my frenemy.

890
00:30:30,671 --> 00:30:33,941
She's one of the best lip syncers ever.

891
00:30:33,975 --> 00:30:35,710
And I want to prove to myself that

892
00:30:35,743 --> 00:30:38,613
I'm also one of the best performers, and

893
00:30:38,679 --> 00:30:42,250
I want this to be a really good battle between us.

894
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:43,651
And since Khianna

895
00:30:43,651 --> 00:30:45,586
was given the disadvantage,

896
00:30:45,586 --> 00:30:46,821
Arizona

897
00:30:46,854 --> 00:30:49,724
you're going to choose your lip sync song.

898
00:30:50,658 --> 00:30:53,361
Arizona, what song would you want to lip sync?

899
00:30:53,427 --> 00:30:56,097
Will it be “Queen” by Silvy

900
00:30:56,797 --> 00:30:59,267
“Boom, Boom, Boom, Boom” by the Vengaboys?

901
00:31:00,268 --> 00:31:01,302
I would choose...

902
00:31:01,302 --> 00:31:02,904
What do you want, sis?

903
00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:05,673
I, um, I want two-piece chicken

904
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,875
- and then fries.
- Not that kind of order.

905
00:31:07,875 --> 00:31:08,943
Not that kind of order!

906
00:31:08,976 --> 00:31:09,677
Yeah.

907
00:31:09,877 --> 00:31:11,879
The song, please.

908
00:31:13,514 --> 00:31:15,416
I would like to choose

909
00:31:15,549 --> 00:31:18,653
“Boom, Boom, Boom, Boom” by the Vengaboys.

910
00:31:18,753 --> 00:31:19,587
Okay.

911
00:31:20,154 --> 00:31:22,356
Do you think you can beat Khianna?

912
00:31:23,124 --> 00:31:25,760
Yes, I can beat her face. Kidding!

913
00:31:27,295 --> 00:31:28,796
I will try my best.

914
00:31:29,196 --> 00:31:31,299
Whatever happens,

915
00:31:31,332 --> 00:31:33,301
you know, it's the universe's will

916
00:31:33,334 --> 00:31:33,901
if I win.

917
00:31:33,901 --> 00:31:34,769
Ahh, like that!

918
00:31:34,769 --> 00:31:36,037
Okay.

919
00:31:36,203 --> 00:31:37,071
Khianna.

920
00:31:37,071 --> 00:31:39,273
What can you say about that?

921
00:31:40,675 --> 00:31:42,643
To my first runner-up sister,

922
00:31:44,412 --> 00:31:45,913
you'll always be a runner-up.

923
00:31:47,481 --> 00:31:49,517
Wait, let me clap back real quick.

924
00:31:49,517 --> 00:31:50,284
Kidding!

925
00:31:50,318 --> 00:31:53,387
Okay, so we got Khianna and Arizona next.

926
00:31:53,387 --> 00:31:56,390
Oh! I'm so excited for them.

927
00:31:56,424 --> 00:31:58,326
They have the same placement

928
00:31:58,326 --> 00:32:00,494
in our track records.

929
00:32:00,828 --> 00:32:01,662
I know.

930
00:32:01,662 --> 00:32:04,131
Lip Sync LaLaPaRuza Smackdown, Round 3.

931
00:32:04,165 --> 00:32:07,268
Arizona Brandy versus Khianna.

932
00:32:07,335 --> 00:32:09,170
Two queens stand before me.

933
00:32:09,804 --> 00:32:11,172
This is your chance to impress me

934
00:32:11,205 --> 00:32:13,474
and save yourself from elimination.

935
00:32:14,575 --> 00:32:16,544
I don't know what's about to happen, so

936
00:32:16,577 --> 00:32:18,512
I'm kind of nervous because I know that

937
00:32:18,546 --> 00:32:20,748
she's a good performer, so

938
00:32:20,748 --> 00:32:22,750
I'm trying my best to look

939
00:32:22,783 --> 00:32:26,187
like a fighter, but deep inside I'm shaking.

940
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,756
The time has come

941
00:32:28,789 --> 00:32:30,758
for you to Lip Sync

942
00:32:30,758 --> 00:32:32,860

943
00:32:35,396 --> 00:32:36,197
Good luck, Queens.

944
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:38,199
And don't fuck it up.

00:32:45,506 --> 00:32:47,708

Someone to make you forget your problems

952
00:33:06,527 --> 00:33:09,130
Just come along, baby, take my hand

953
00:33:09,964 --> 00:33:12,199

Love it!

1006
00:35:34,675 --> 00:35:39,013
- So who do you think is going to win this lip sync?
- Love it!

1007
00:35:39,046 --> 00:35:39,647
This is hard.

1008
00:35:39,647 --> 00:35:41,048
- Because this is like two different
- Yes, this is hard.

1009
00:35:41,048 --> 00:35:42,449
takes on drag.

1010
00:35:42,483 --> 00:35:44,018
One is like very energetic

1011
00:35:44,018 --> 00:35:45,986
and one is like very camp.

1012
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:49,890
I feel like Khianna was doing, going too hard, maybe, a little bit.

1013
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:51,358
Yeah, she's so serious.

1014
00:35:51,392 --> 00:35:53,093
Like this is supposed to be a fun song, you know?

1015
00:35:53,093 --> 00:35:54,028
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1016
00:35:54,295 --> 00:35:55,796
Now, Sasha.

1017
00:35:55,829 --> 00:35:57,798
Do these Slaysian assassins

1018
00:35:57,798 --> 00:35:59,700
have you gagged or

1019
00:35:59,833 --> 00:36:01,702
left you wanting more?

1020
00:36:01,869 --> 00:36:04,138
Oh, Mama Pao, they have me

1021
00:36:04,138 --> 00:36:05,639
gagged.

1022
00:36:05,706 --> 00:36:07,374
You all were so amazing.

1023
00:36:07,374 --> 00:36:08,676
The lip sync was on.

1024
00:36:08,676 --> 00:36:10,945
The choreography was amazing.

1025
00:36:11,212 --> 00:36:13,147
This is exactly why I came

1026
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:14,915
- to the Philippines was to see
- Yes.

1027
00:36:14,915 --> 00:36:15,950
some good drag.

1028
00:36:15,950 --> 00:36:17,051
I'm just saying.

1029
00:36:18,919 --> 00:36:20,821
The Slaysian Royale is slaying.

1030
00:36:20,821 --> 00:36:22,489
Amazing job, both of you.

1031
00:36:22,957 --> 00:36:23,424
Thank you.

1032
00:36:23,457 --> 00:36:25,159
Thank you, Sasha.

1033
00:36:25,526 --> 00:36:27,461
Ladies.

1034
00:36:27,461 --> 00:36:29,430
I have made my decision.

1035
00:36:34,268 --> 00:36:36,036
Arizona Brandy.

1036
00:36:38,639 --> 00:36:39,807
Shantay, you stay.

1037
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,242
Oh, my God, thank you!

1038
00:36:42,009 --> 00:36:44,912
I'm just so proud of myself for winning this.

1039
00:36:44,945 --> 00:36:47,014
It just proved that

1040
00:36:47,014 --> 00:36:48,382
I can do it.

1041
00:36:48,382 --> 00:36:50,451
So yeah, I'm happy.

1042
00:36:52,086 --> 00:36:53,821
You are free to slay another day.

1043
00:36:53,988 --> 00:36:55,956
You may go to the back of the stage.

1044
00:36:57,992 --> 00:36:59,260
I love you.

1045
00:37:01,262 --> 00:37:02,162
Shit.

1046
00:37:02,196 --> 00:37:03,697
Congrats!

1047
00:37:03,731 --> 00:37:04,565
Oh, my God.

1048
00:37:04,598 --> 00:37:05,866
Khianna, don't worry.

1049
00:37:05,899 --> 00:37:08,335
You have one more chance to prove yourself later.

1050
00:37:08,369 --> 00:37:10,404
But for now, please go back to the Werkroom.

1051
00:37:11,605 --> 00:37:12,706
That was great, Khianna.

1052
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:14,508
- Good job, Khianna!
- Amazing.

1053
00:37:14,508 --> 00:37:15,342
Love me.

1054
00:37:15,376 --> 00:37:18,479
- Yes! Go sister!
- Congrats!

1055
00:37:19,713 --> 00:37:20,481
See you later!

00:37:20,481 --> 00:37:21,482
See you later.

1057
00:37:21,815 --> 00:37:23,417
What a waste!

1058
00:37:23,717 --> 00:37:24,084
See you later.

1059
00:37:24,184 --> 00:37:26,987
Come join the circle, baby.

1060
00:37:27,021 --> 00:37:28,322
- Oh, my God.
- What's up?

1061
00:37:28,455 --> 00:37:30,157
Oh, Khianna!

1062
00:37:30,624 --> 00:37:32,059
You're very quiet.

1063
00:37:32,793 --> 00:37:34,795
I'm still catching my breath because

1064
00:37:35,462 --> 00:37:38,699
I did the mostest that I could, girl.

1065
00:37:38,966 --> 00:37:40,868
I was fainting but

1066
00:37:40,868 --> 00:37:41,935
amazed also.

1067
00:37:42,036 --> 00:37:43,003
But you know what?

1068
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:45,239
It is what it is.

1069
00:37:46,974 --> 00:37:51,178
Queens, Suki Doll, Brigiding, and Arizona Brandy,

1070
00:37:51,245 --> 00:37:53,414

00:37:56,884 --> 00:37:58,786
They're going to lip sync already.

1073
00:37:59,753 --> 00:38:00,654
All three?

1074
00:38:01,221 --> 00:38:03,157
But wait, there's more.

1075
00:38:06,994 --> 00:38:08,295
It's the Lip Sync

1077
00:38:12,199 --> 00:38:16,337
Oh, my God!

1078
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:18,138
You heard that right.

1079
00:38:18,238 --> 00:38:20,908
- Yes.
- The three of you will lip sync to determine

1080
00:38:20,974 --> 00:38:25,379

1084
00:38:32,686 --> 00:38:35,356
I'm excited because there's a RuBadge at stake.

1085
00:38:35,389 --> 00:38:38,092
I hope it's going to be my second RuBadge.

1086
00:38:38,125 --> 00:38:39,093
I want to win this.

1087
00:38:39,126 --> 00:38:41,895

Three queens stand before me.

1091
00:38:51,472 --> 00:38:53,474

00:39:34,548 --> 00:39:37,551

I'm a, I'm a queen de la fiesta

1110
00:39:40,354 --> 00:39:42,990
Why be regular when you can be extra?

You wanna be me, but I won't let ya

Who do you think is going to win?

1172
00:42:30,524 --> 00:42:32,259
This is hard.

1173
00:42:32,259 --> 00:42:34,661
- But I think Brigiding.
- I think for me, yeah.

1174
00:42:34,661 --> 00:42:36,430
Brigiding

1175
00:42:36,530 --> 00:42:38,465
was shining the most out of the three.

1176
00:42:38,498 --> 00:42:39,032
Yeah.

1177
00:42:39,032 --> 00:42:39,833
Same for me too.

1178
00:42:39,833 --> 00:42:41,101
You, Viñas?

1179
00:42:41,201 --> 00:42:42,669
It's Brigiding.

1180
00:42:43,203 --> 00:42:46,707
My Precious, delicious...

1181
00:42:46,773 --> 00:42:48,842
Who do you think ate this round?

1182
00:42:49,409 --> 00:42:51,244
Okay, Mama Pao, I just want to say

1183
00:42:51,311 --> 00:42:53,146
condragulations, the three of you.

1184
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:55,415
All of you are equally talented

1185
00:42:55,449 --> 00:42:57,217
and all of you are superstars.

1186
00:42:57,217 --> 00:42:58,986
But, there's one queen

1187
00:42:59,019 --> 00:43:00,354
who really stood out to me.

1188
00:43:00,354 --> 00:43:02,789
Because she knows the words,

1189
00:43:02,823 --> 00:43:04,458
she enjoyed the song,

1190
00:43:04,591 --> 00:43:06,059
and she had fun.

1191
00:43:06,059 --> 00:43:07,361
How about you, Sasha?

1192
00:43:07,394 --> 00:43:08,862

- Instead of like competing with each other

1196
00:43:14,601 --> 00:43:15,802
you all just...

1197
00:43:15,902 --> 00:43:18,105
It was just a three stars on stage.

1198
00:43:18,105 --> 00:43:19,339
That's all I can say.

1199
00:43:19,439 --> 00:43:21,808
Good luck to all of you because

1200
00:43:21,842 --> 00:43:22,809
this is a hard challenge

1201
00:43:22,809 --> 00:43:23,977
and you all turned it.

You two queens were really great.

1225
00:44:14,995 --> 00:44:16,463
You are safe.

1226
00:44:16,830 --> 00:44:20,200
- What a pity.
- What a pity, indeed.

1227
00:44:21,501 --> 00:44:22,602
Queens.

1228
00:44:23,136 --> 00:44:25,739
We are now at the end of our Lip Sync LaLaPaRuza Slaysian Smackdown.

1229
00:44:27,908 --> 00:44:28,909
For the last song,

two of the losing queens

1231
00:44:30,043 --> 00:44:32,546
will lip sync for their lives.

1232
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:34,748
Just two.

1233
00:44:35,882 --> 00:44:38,985
This week, you, Brigiding,

00:44:39,019 --> 00:44:41,054

1238
00:44:49,329 --> 00:44:51,298

00:44:53,166 --> 00:44:55,736
in the final round of LaLaPaRuza.

You hold your sisters' fates in your hands.

1242
00:45:01,441 --> 00:45:03,510
That means Yuhua,

1243
00:45:03,677 --> 00:45:05,078
Viñas DeLuxe,

1244
00:45:05,078 --> 00:45:06,513
Khianna,

1245
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:08,515
as the bottom queens,

1246
00:45:08,682 --> 00:45:11,618
you may plead your case while you untuck.

1247
00:45:11,985 --> 00:45:13,787
Let's plead our cases.

1248
00:45:13,787 --> 00:45:15,655
- Oh, my God, I knew it.
- With them.

1249
00:45:16,123 --> 00:45:17,357
I...

1250
00:45:17,357 --> 00:45:17,858
knew it

1251
00:45:17,858 --> 00:45:19,693
that they're going to save someone from the bottom because

1252
00:45:19,693 --> 00:45:21,161
this happened to me

1253
00:45:22,529 --> 00:45:22,963
last

1254
00:45:22,963 --> 00:45:25,432
season, Season 3, so...

1255
00:45:26,366 --> 00:45:27,334
I know what's going on.

1256
00:45:27,334 --> 00:45:30,070
So from the winning team, they're gonna choose

1257
00:45:30,070 --> 00:45:34,908
one queen to save from the bottom, and then the two remaining

1258
00:45:34,908 --> 00:45:38,145
have to save thier asses out from the bottom.

1259
00:45:38,378 --> 00:45:41,081
Queens, you may leave the stage.

1260
00:45:42,649 --> 00:45:43,683
Thank you.

1261
00:45:44,084 --> 00:45:45,752
Thank you.

1262
00:45:50,657 --> 00:45:51,491
Congrats!

1263
00:45:56,930 --> 00:45:59,533
- I'm a, I'm a queen de la fiesta

1264
00:45:59,533 --> 00:46:02,369
- Oh, my God!
- Congrats, Brigiding!

1265
00:46:03,336 --> 00:46:04,571
Congratulations, sister.

1266
00:46:04,571 --> 00:46:05,739
Come, eat something.

1267
00:46:06,306 --> 00:46:08,308
- You all do look like a girl group.
- Sister, this is for you, sister.

1268
00:46:08,308 --> 00:46:10,510
Girl for you, for you, for you.

1269
00:46:10,510 --> 00:46:14,247
If you survive LaLaPaRuza, that means when it comes to

1270
00:46:14,281 --> 00:46:18,285
lips, mouth, syncing the words,

1271
00:46:18,318 --> 00:46:19,853
and you win in that, then

1272
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,289
you are one hell of a good drag performer.

1273
00:46:23,623 --> 00:46:24,991
How do you all feel?

1274
00:46:25,892 --> 00:46:27,394
I feel very ecstatic.

1275
00:46:27,794 --> 00:46:30,230
ECSTATIC?!

1276
00:46:30,597 --> 00:46:32,499
I was gobsmacked by the—

1277
00:46:32,833 --> 00:46:34,801
GOBSMACKED?!

1278
00:46:34,968 --> 00:46:37,137
But I feel fantabulous tonight.

1279
00:46:37,270 --> 00:46:39,139
FANTABULOUS?!

1280
00:46:39,139 --> 00:46:41,141
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

1281
00:46:41,141 --> 00:46:42,142
That's how I feel.

1282
00:46:42,142 --> 00:46:43,276
How about you?

1283
00:46:43,643 --> 00:46:44,744
Honestly, I feel great because

1284
00:46:44,744 --> 00:46:46,146
I never really get a chance to perform

1285
00:46:46,146 --> 00:46:48,381
or like do that aspect of my drag.

1286
00:46:48,381 --> 00:46:49,449
Because I'm so focused on design,

1287
00:46:49,449 --> 00:46:50,884
making things for the girls,

1288
00:46:50,884 --> 00:46:52,319
always like mothering everyone.

1289
00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:53,920
So it's just fun to be able to

1290
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:56,156
let loose and go out there, you know, and

1291
00:46:56,156 --> 00:46:57,324
show my performance side.

1292
00:46:57,324 --> 00:47:00,360
So I'm very happy, and I'm happy to be

1293
00:47:00,427 --> 00:47:01,728
in the LaLaPaRuza second round!

1294
00:47:01,728 --> 00:47:03,263
Yes! You were fabulous.

1295
00:47:03,463 --> 00:47:04,531
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

1296
00:47:04,831 --> 00:47:08,602
- Congratulations to me, cheers!
- Congrats, Brigiding!

1297
00:47:08,869 --> 00:47:11,271
I won LaLaPaRuza, bitches!

1298
00:47:11,271 --> 00:47:13,139
And you well deserve it.

1299
00:47:13,139 --> 00:47:16,009
To be able to win

1300
00:47:16,276 --> 00:47:21,147
a challenge that requires lip syncing, performance,

1301
00:47:21,147 --> 00:47:25,352
and serving essence and looks...

1302
00:47:27,387 --> 00:47:28,121
Mine!

1303
00:47:28,154 --> 00:47:29,656
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding!

1304
00:47:29,856 --> 00:47:32,626
So, as you know, I was awarded by Mama Pao

1305
00:47:32,659 --> 00:47:35,996
to choose two queens

1306
00:47:35,996 --> 00:47:39,299
who will Lip Sync for their Lives tonight.

1307
00:47:39,299 --> 00:47:41,334
And I wanna hear from all of you guys

1308
00:47:41,334 --> 00:47:43,470
in front of everybody, so...

1309
00:47:43,570 --> 00:47:48,541
I share that win with Suki and Arizona so we can get to decide at least.

1310
00:47:48,608 --> 00:47:50,510
Now, Brigiding has the power

1311
00:47:50,543 --> 00:47:52,112
but she's also asking our advice

1312
00:47:52,145 --> 00:47:54,381
because she doesn't want to take the full responsibility.

1313
00:47:54,481 --> 00:47:56,516
I think this is a great responsibility

1314
00:47:56,516 --> 00:47:57,550
to save somebody,

1315
00:47:57,550 --> 00:47:59,519
but it should be deserved.

1316
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:02,188
Who do we think should be saved tonight?

1317
00:48:03,356 --> 00:48:04,658
You should go first, Yuhua.

1318
00:48:05,091 --> 00:48:06,760
I am a fierce competitor.

1319
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:08,428
I'm a great queen.

1320
00:48:08,628 --> 00:48:10,797
I'm kind, I'm smart, I'm creative.

1321
00:48:10,897 --> 00:48:12,232
I'm great at what I do.

1322
00:48:12,365 --> 00:48:14,267
And I want to be in the finale with

1323
00:48:14,267 --> 00:48:15,335
you.

1324
00:48:15,335 --> 00:48:17,837
My drag is different, and so is yours.

1325
00:48:17,871 --> 00:48:19,873
And I think that with both of our perspectives,

1326
00:48:19,873 --> 00:48:21,675
we can create great moments together.

1327
00:48:21,675 --> 00:48:24,377
I think that when you compare

1328
00:48:24,377 --> 00:48:26,246
two different sides of drag together

1329
00:48:26,813 --> 00:48:29,950
and you are the best at what you do, I think that makes

1330
00:48:29,983 --> 00:48:30,884
a great queen

1331
00:48:30,917 --> 00:48:32,185
if that makes sense.

1332
00:48:32,185 --> 00:48:33,320
Because we're so different.

1333
00:48:33,486 --> 00:48:35,588
While Yuhua is giving fire,

1334
00:48:35,722 --> 00:48:37,290
is giving emotions.

1335
00:48:37,524 --> 00:48:38,258
It’s hard.

1336
00:48:38,258 --> 00:48:39,259
Making a decision is very hard.

1337
00:48:41,227 --> 00:48:42,262
Why not the others?

1338
00:48:42,262 --> 00:48:43,797
Because I'm different.

1339
00:48:43,830 --> 00:48:44,864
I'm different.

1340
00:48:45,732 --> 00:48:47,167
And to beat someone different,

1341
00:48:47,167 --> 00:48:49,602
that takes great talent.

1342
00:48:49,602 --> 00:48:51,571
But to beat someone similar,

1343
00:48:51,571 --> 00:48:53,306
that's an easy route.

1344
00:48:55,308 --> 00:48:57,243
What about you, sister?

1345
00:48:57,877 --> 00:49:00,847
If we look at the track records,

1346
00:49:00,847 --> 00:49:02,549
you know, I mean,

1347
00:49:02,549 --> 00:49:05,285
I deserve to stay

1348
00:49:05,318 --> 00:49:07,988
and I don't want lip sync tonight.

1349
00:49:08,021 --> 00:49:09,823
- Please spare me some lip sync.
- Why not?

1350
00:49:09,823 --> 00:49:10,790
- But you're so good at it.
- Just kidding.

1351
00:49:10,824 --> 00:49:12,826
- Please spare me some lip sync.
- Why not?

1352
00:49:12,826 --> 00:49:16,029
So my strategy is to use my

1353
00:49:16,096 --> 00:49:17,998
you know, RuBadges.

1354
00:49:17,998 --> 00:49:19,532
Go ahead and try to eliminate me.

1355
00:49:19,532 --> 00:49:21,768
People are going to bash you. Kidding!

1356
00:49:21,768 --> 00:49:24,738
I've been on the top for the past six weeks.

1357
00:49:24,771 --> 00:49:26,840
And...

1358
00:49:26,940 --> 00:49:29,309
I want to stay.

1359
00:49:29,876 --> 00:49:32,679
And I'm telling you I'm not going.

1360
00:49:33,046 --> 00:49:33,913
Yeah, that's it.

1361
00:49:33,913 --> 00:49:35,482
Viñas...

1362
00:49:35,515 --> 00:49:37,250
Pleading her case...

1363
00:49:37,851 --> 00:49:40,120
Was she really pleading? Kidding!

1364
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:44,657
She says she was, but I don't think so. Kidding.

1365
00:49:45,158 --> 00:49:46,726
I didn't need to strategize.

1366
00:49:46,726 --> 00:49:49,195
I just had to scare them a little. Kidding.

1367
00:49:49,629 --> 00:49:54,601
I just let go and let Brigiding do her thing.

1368
00:49:54,667 --> 00:49:56,803
And I hope that she

1369
00:49:56,803 --> 00:49:59,239
will do the right thing this time.

1370
00:49:59,272 --> 00:50:00,106
How about you, Khianna?

1371
00:50:00,106 --> 00:50:00,974
Me?

1372
00:50:01,708 --> 00:50:04,144
I just want to say

1373
00:50:04,244 --> 00:50:05,078
that

1374
00:50:05,111 --> 00:50:06,679
Viñas is right.

1375
00:50:07,013 --> 00:50:08,882
She has two RuBadges.

1376
00:50:08,915 --> 00:50:10,383
I have one RuBadge,

1377
00:50:10,383 --> 00:50:12,619
you have one RuBadge,

1378
00:50:12,652 --> 00:50:14,254
and we've been safe.

1379
00:50:14,287 --> 00:50:15,655
So I think,

1380
00:50:16,056 --> 00:50:18,124
it's between me and you.

1381
00:50:18,124 --> 00:50:20,060
I don't need the Golden Balut.

1382
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:22,662
I will save myself.

1383
00:50:22,796 --> 00:50:24,864
So Brigiding, save

1384
00:50:25,031 --> 00:50:26,433
Viñas.

1385
00:50:26,499 --> 00:50:28,301
Choose me and Yuhua.

1386
00:50:28,334 --> 00:50:30,670
Because I want to prove myself.

1387
00:50:30,703 --> 00:50:32,238
Because last week,

1388
00:50:32,238 --> 00:50:34,207
that was not me.

1389
00:50:34,441 --> 00:50:35,442
And tonight,

1390
00:50:35,442 --> 00:50:38,078
I'm proving myself again.

1391
00:50:38,111 --> 00:50:40,146
Because this,

1392
00:50:40,780 --> 00:50:42,882
this is Slaysian Royale.

1393
00:50:43,049 --> 00:50:44,884
I don't want to lip sync just once.

1394
00:50:45,018 --> 00:50:47,487
I want to lip sync twice, or thrice, today if need be.

1395
00:50:47,487 --> 00:50:49,222
I can do it five more times. Go.

1396
00:50:49,456 --> 00:50:51,724
I k-an do it. (With a K)

1397
00:50:52,225 --> 00:50:53,760
And I'm so sorry

1398
00:50:53,893 --> 00:50:55,762
if last week I said I wanted to go home.

1399
00:50:55,795 --> 00:50:56,763
No.

1400
00:50:56,896 --> 00:50:59,799
I don't want to go home.

1401
00:50:59,866 --> 00:51:01,935
I want to be in the Top 4 with y’all guys.

1402
00:51:01,968 --> 00:51:04,504
And I am going to prove it to y’all, now.

1403
00:51:04,838 --> 00:51:07,707
So please save her because she's been on top.

1404
00:51:07,707 --> 00:51:09,742
And it's between me and Yuhua.

1405
00:51:10,443 --> 00:51:11,711
I need to fight.

1406
00:51:11,711 --> 00:51:12,345
I need to fight.

1407
00:51:12,345 --> 00:51:13,379
Don't save me.

1408
00:51:13,413 --> 00:51:14,147
Don't

1409
00:51:14,147 --> 00:51:16,015
fucking ever save me, girl.

1410
00:51:16,049 --> 00:51:18,284
Because I want to prove myself this time.

1411
00:51:18,284 --> 00:51:20,153
So I love that this time,

1412
00:51:20,153 --> 00:51:21,621
Khianna wants to fight.

1413
00:51:21,654 --> 00:51:22,755
I see the fire in her.

1414
00:51:22,755 --> 00:51:23,890
It's back.

1415
00:51:23,890 --> 00:51:25,091
The Khianna that

1416
00:51:25,325 --> 00:51:27,193
I want to compete with, is back.

1417
00:51:27,193 --> 00:51:28,528
And I'm happy for her.

1418
00:51:28,561 --> 00:51:29,863
First of all, so

1419
00:51:29,963 --> 00:51:32,065
right now, Khianna is like surrendering

1420
00:51:32,065 --> 00:51:34,467
and she wants to lip sync, she wants to prove herself.

1421
00:51:34,501 --> 00:51:35,969
- Exactly.
- So the choice is between...

1422
00:51:35,969 --> 00:51:38,571
if we're going to save Yuhua, or Viñas.

1423
00:51:38,605 --> 00:51:41,141
If I have the Golden Balut, you know what?

1424
00:51:41,174 --> 00:51:43,643
Just for it to be funny, I would give it to her.

1425
00:51:43,676 --> 00:51:44,277
You know what I mean?

1426
00:51:44,310 --> 00:51:47,046
Imagine, how she’s saying "I can do this, I have what it takes!"

1427
00:51:47,046 --> 00:51:49,048
Then you hand it to her.

1428
00:51:50,917 --> 00:51:52,485
I felt the fire

1429
00:51:52,485 --> 00:51:53,686
that you had.

1430
00:51:53,686 --> 00:51:55,688
If we're basing that on how you pled,

1431
00:51:55,722 --> 00:51:57,157
I would choose Yuhua.

1432
00:51:57,190 --> 00:51:59,425
You've earned so much respect from me.

1433
00:51:59,459 --> 00:52:01,327
Ever since you've been here.

1434
00:52:01,327 --> 00:52:03,730
She has always been someones who says

1435
00:52:03,763 --> 00:52:06,065
we're doing amazing, and

1436
00:52:06,099 --> 00:52:08,201
you are doing so amazing.

1437
00:52:10,603 --> 00:52:12,472
Oh, my goodness. Bitch.

1438
00:52:12,505 --> 00:52:15,008
Why'd you have to make me cry like this?

1439
00:52:15,041 --> 00:52:16,976
She shared a very sincere moment,

1440
00:52:17,010 --> 00:52:19,612
a lot of positive comments, and bitch!

1441
00:52:19,612 --> 00:52:21,748
I want go unto that Main Stage with fire.

1442
00:52:21,748 --> 00:52:22,815
And now you're making me cry?

1443
00:52:22,815 --> 00:52:24,017
Girl, come on!

1444
00:52:24,250 --> 00:52:27,086
Sorry, I just... I just never really hear words like that

1445
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:30,023
from my other fellow drag sisters.

1446
00:52:32,025 --> 00:52:34,994
To connect with all of you,

1447
00:52:35,061 --> 00:52:37,997
and we're all from different parts of the world,

1448
00:52:38,131 --> 00:52:40,366
and we're all under one roof,

1449
00:52:40,466 --> 00:52:42,936
to share the drag, the love, the compassion,

1450
00:52:42,936 --> 00:52:44,604
the joy that it brings.

1451
00:52:45,505 --> 00:52:46,673
It's amazing.

1452
00:52:47,907 --> 00:52:49,442
Fucking amazing.

1453
00:52:49,709 --> 00:52:50,877
I feel seen.

1454
00:52:50,877 --> 00:52:51,744
I feel...

1455
00:52:51,911 --> 00:52:54,347
like I'm not invisible. I feel like...

1456
00:52:58,117 --> 00:53:00,420
- Yuhua, let this be a reminder.
- You're not. We've been watching you.

1457
00:53:00,453 --> 00:53:03,356
Let this be a reminder that you exist.

1458
00:53:03,356 --> 00:53:05,358
You are a powerhouse.

1459
00:53:05,592 --> 00:53:09,862
You, representing Asia in the US franchise

1460
00:53:09,862 --> 00:53:12,632
is one big hell of a thing.

1461
00:53:12,765 --> 00:53:13,967
We see you and

1462
00:53:13,967 --> 00:53:15,702
you are fucking Slaysian Royale.

1463
00:53:16,102 --> 00:53:19,272
You really inspired me so much.

1464
00:53:19,272 --> 00:53:20,707
No, I'm not kidding.

1465
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:24,010
Because Yuhua Hamasaki was doing the most.

1466
00:53:24,010 --> 00:53:26,713
Extravagant. She is that...

1467
00:53:26,713 --> 00:53:28,715
character.

1468
00:53:29,115 --> 00:53:32,118
And I've been that. I've been that kind of kid.

1469
00:53:32,118 --> 00:53:33,553
So thank you.

1470
00:53:33,853 --> 00:53:35,989
I love Yuhua because she's so

1471
00:53:36,022 --> 00:53:38,725
positive in every aspect.

1472
00:53:38,725 --> 00:53:40,727
She somehow always finds

1473
00:53:40,827 --> 00:53:43,229
light in the darkness.

1474
00:53:43,796 --> 00:53:46,966
I guess I came here to find acceptance

1475
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,769
and love and I guess I found it.

1476
00:53:49,802 --> 00:53:53,006
Thanks to all of you, everybody involved.

1477
00:53:54,941 --> 00:53:56,776
Thank you so much.

1478
00:53:58,177 --> 00:54:00,246
Don't worry, all the,

1479
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:02,448
our security officers' food is

1480
00:54:02,448 --> 00:54:03,583
- for you.
- Will be given to you.

1481
00:54:03,616 --> 00:54:06,185
Fucking raise the budget for food!

1482
00:54:06,219 --> 00:54:07,820
We're hungry for you.

1483
00:54:07,820 --> 00:54:08,721
Don't worry, don't worry.

1484
00:54:08,755 --> 00:54:11,591
Yeah, we know there's a lot of energy that's you know...

1485
00:54:11,624 --> 00:54:13,359
Wait, but Yuhua,

1486
00:54:13,359 --> 00:54:14,260
You, huh?

1487
00:54:14,294 --> 00:54:16,763
- Yuhua you still have one more chance
- You here?

1488
00:54:16,796 --> 00:54:18,531
- to prove yourself, that you
- Right, yeah.

1489
00:54:18,531 --> 00:54:21,067
- have to be here in this competition.
- One more chance?

1490
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:22,635
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?

1491
00:54:22,635 --> 00:54:23,369
No...

1492
00:54:23,569 --> 00:54:25,405
You're not going to save me, bitch?

1493
00:54:26,005 --> 00:54:27,440
After all those tears?!

1494
00:54:31,944 --> 00:54:34,414
What if we're strategic this time?

1495
00:54:34,447 --> 00:54:38,718
This track record shit is getting old.

1496
00:54:38,718 --> 00:54:42,221
Why don't we twist things a bit? Add a little drama.

1497
00:54:42,221 --> 00:54:43,556
Since this is Slaysian Royale and

1498
00:54:43,556 --> 00:54:45,058
we love drama in the Philippines.

1499
00:54:45,058 --> 00:54:46,526
You know, it's like,

1500
00:54:46,626 --> 00:54:48,594
we're just giving a good show.

1501
00:54:50,196 --> 00:54:52,365
Welcome back, Queens.

1502
00:54:52,465 --> 00:54:53,733
Brigiding.

1503
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,136
Heavy is the hand that holds the Golden Balut.

1504
00:54:57,236 --> 00:54:59,539
Who are the two queens you choose

1505
00:54:59,572 --> 00:55:01,674
to Lip Sync for their Lives?

1506
00:55:02,208 --> 00:55:05,445
The first queen that I'm choosing to Lip Sync for

1507
00:55:05,478 --> 00:55:07,046
her Life

1508
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:10,483
is someone that I have been looking up to.

1509
00:55:10,616 --> 00:55:13,686
She's someone that has shown

1510
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:16,055
Slaysian Royale excellence.

1511
00:55:16,055 --> 00:55:18,257
Her drag may be different,

1512
00:55:18,324 --> 00:55:21,761
but she is someone to be celebrated.

1513
00:55:21,761 --> 00:55:24,163
And that queen is...

1514
00:55:25,998 --> 00:55:26,866
Yuhua.

1515
00:55:29,135 --> 00:55:32,638
And the second queen that I'm choosing to lip sync against Yuhua,

1516
00:55:32,672 --> 00:55:34,941
is someone that I can call

1517
00:55:35,441 --> 00:55:37,210
my best friend.

1518
00:55:40,713 --> 00:55:43,416
She's been doing so well in this competition as well.

1519
00:55:45,818 --> 00:55:46,819
Are you sure?

1520
00:55:46,886 --> 00:55:48,321
And

1521
00:55:48,321 --> 00:55:51,124
the queen that I'm choosing to lip sync against Yuhua

1522
00:55:51,124 --> 00:55:53,726
is someone that I believe

1523
00:55:53,726 --> 00:55:55,495
that will

1524
00:55:55,595 --> 00:55:58,064
give us an amazing show.

1525
00:55:58,064 --> 00:55:58,798
Sis, no.

1526
00:55:58,831 --> 00:56:01,033
Amazing drag,

1527
00:56:01,100 --> 00:56:02,869
amazing talent,

1528
00:56:02,969 --> 00:56:06,439
all throughout, even after this competition.

1529
00:56:08,074 --> 00:56:11,043
And that queen that I'm choosing is...

1530
00:56:13,045 --> 00:56:14,380
Khianna.

1531
00:56:16,582 --> 00:56:17,150
Fuck you.

1532
00:56:18,351 --> 00:56:21,053
So I'm giving this Balut to

1533
00:56:21,621 --> 00:56:24,056
my sister, Viñas DeLuxe.

1534
00:56:24,257 --> 00:56:26,192
She’s so annoying!

1535
00:56:26,426 --> 00:56:27,393
Attention-seeker!

1536
00:56:27,393 --> 00:56:30,129
How did Khianna become your best friend?

1537
00:56:30,129 --> 00:56:31,731
You just met her this season.

1538
00:56:31,731 --> 00:56:32,965
Now you're best friends already?

1539
00:56:32,965 --> 00:56:34,600
We've been together for so long and

1540
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:36,002
we just call each other Divine Divas?

1541
00:56:36,002 --> 00:56:38,704
Sis, you don't even call me your best friend, you’re so extra.

1542
00:56:39,071 --> 00:56:40,573
Viñas DeLuxe.

1543
00:56:40,673 --> 00:56:42,041
You are saved

1544
00:56:42,041 --> 00:56:43,910
by the Golden Balut.

1545
00:56:44,043 --> 00:56:47,447
- So Khianna is your best friend now?
- I didn't know we were best friends, sis.

1546
00:56:48,247 --> 00:56:49,549
You deserve it.

1547
00:56:49,549 --> 00:56:50,149
Thank you, sis.

1548
00:56:51,451 --> 00:56:54,320
Thank you, sister. Okay.

1549
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:56,322
Your debt is paid. Just kidding!

1550
00:56:58,524 --> 00:56:59,992
Yuhua and Khianna.

1551
00:57:01,060 --> 00:57:03,196
I'm sorry, but both of you

1552
00:57:03,262 --> 00:57:05,731
are up for elimination.

1553
00:57:05,898 --> 00:57:08,367
Two queens stand before me.

1554
00:57:09,101 --> 00:57:11,571
Prior to tonight, you were asked to prepare

1555
00:57:11,571 --> 00:57:13,539
a lip sync performance of the song

1556
00:57:13,573 --> 00:57:16,209
“Misbehave” by Lola Amour.

1557
00:57:16,309 --> 00:57:17,677
This is the final battle

1558
00:57:17,743 --> 00:57:20,480
for this LaLaPaRuza Slaysian Smackdown.

1559
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:22,715
So you better behave

1560
00:57:22,782 --> 00:57:26,252
because for the first time in Drag Race herstory,

1561
00:57:26,385 --> 00:57:28,654
Lola Amour will be playing their song

1562
00:57:28,788 --> 00:57:31,858
LIVE while you Lip Sync for your Life.

1563
00:57:32,258 --> 00:57:33,960
Oh, my God, this is so iconic

1564
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:36,128
because Lola Amour is here.

1565
00:57:36,329 --> 00:57:37,563
I love them so much.

1566
00:57:37,563 --> 00:57:39,732
So this is a Drag Race’s first, right?

1567
00:57:39,732 --> 00:57:41,968
It’s a live band

1568
00:57:41,968 --> 00:57:44,370
playing, and then the girls are lip syncing.

1569
00:57:44,370 --> 00:57:45,571
I really want it,

1570
00:57:45,571 --> 00:57:46,906
I really want to do it!

1571
00:57:46,906 --> 00:57:48,741
I should’ve placed myself in the bottom.

1572
00:57:48,741 --> 00:57:49,675
Kidding!

1573
00:57:56,082 --> 00:57:57,583
Now, Queens.

1574
00:57:57,583 --> 00:57:59,585
This is your last chance to impress me

1575
00:57:59,619 --> 00:58:03,789
and save yourself from elimination.

1576
00:58:04,123 --> 00:58:04,957
Khianna.

1577
00:58:04,991 --> 00:58:07,326
I know you are fierce, baby.

1578
00:58:07,326 --> 00:58:08,594
But baby,

1579
00:58:08,628 --> 00:58:10,997
I've been doing this shit longer than you, girl.

1580
00:58:10,997 --> 00:58:12,965
So let's see how this turns out.

1581
00:58:13,699 --> 00:58:15,735
The time has come

1582
00:58:17,270 --> 00:58:19,772
for you to Lip Sync

1583
00:58:19,772 --> 00:58:22,341
for your Life!

1584
00:58:24,777 --> 00:58:28,347
So I'm going to give you what Khianna is all about,

1585
00:58:28,648 --> 00:58:29,949
why she deserves to stay,

1586
00:58:29,949 --> 00:58:31,017
and I will give you

1587
00:58:31,050 --> 00:58:32,585
the gag of your life.

1588
00:58:33,386 --> 00:58:34,620
Enjoy.

1589
00:58:34,854 --> 00:58:36,055
Good luck, Queens.

1590
00:58:36,055 --> 00:58:38,758
And don't fuck it up!

1591
00:58:50,570 --> 00:58:52,238
One, two.

1592
00:58:52,538 --> 00:58:54,473
One, two, three, woo!

1593
00:59:10,423 --> 00:59:13,459
Shit, I didn't wanna go on a trip

1594
00:59:13,459 --> 00:59:17,363
But it's looks like I'm not in control

1595
00:59:18,397 --> 00:59:21,133
I had more than I would like to admit

1596
00:59:21,334 --> 00:59:25,037
But I feel like that might be the goal

1597
00:59:25,204 --> 00:59:28,207
Try to fight,

1598
00:59:28,207 --> 00:59:32,144
But I'm a lonely night away

1599
00:59:33,079 --> 00:59:36,015
In the siren

1600
00:59:36,015 --> 00:59:40,252
Finding the move to make mistakes

1601
00:59:41,487 --> 00:59:44,924
Take my hand if you wanna escape

1602
00:59:44,924 --> 00:59:48,361
It don’t matter cause the night is young

1603
00:59:48,828 --> 00:59:52,598
No regrets, let go, put your problems away

1604
00:59:52,632 --> 00:59:55,735
Cause tonight I don't care if it's wrong

1605
00:59:55,768 --> 00:59:58,871
I wanna misbehave

1606
00:59:58,938 --> 00:59:59,672
(Hey)

1607
01:00:00,673 --> 01:00:02,108
Do something about it

1608
01:00:02,642 --> 01:00:03,342
(Go ahead)

1609
01:00:03,609 --> 01:00:06,746
I wanna misbehave

1610
01:00:06,812 --> 01:00:08,514
(You)

1611
01:00:08,547 --> 01:00:09,982
Do something about it

1612
01:00:10,016 --> 01:00:11,217
(Go ahead)

1613
01:00:13,653 --> 01:00:16,389
Damn baby I'm a mess since you left

1614
01:00:16,422 --> 01:00:20,292
Now I'm feeling for trouble tonight

1615
01:00:21,527 --> 01:00:24,263
No baby I'm not looking for love,

1616
01:00:24,296 --> 01:00:28,167
I'm just looking for paradise

1617
01:00:28,868 --> 01:00:31,871
Take my hand if you wanna escape

1618
01:00:32,138 --> 01:00:35,574
It don't matter cause the night is young

1619
01:00:36,075 --> 01:00:40,012
No regrets, let go, put your problems away

1620
01:00:40,012 --> 01:00:42,948
Cause tonight I don't care if it's wrong

1621
01:00:42,948 --> 01:00:46,152
I wanna misbehave

1622
01:00:46,152 --> 01:00:46,886
(Hey)

1623
01:00:47,887 --> 01:00:49,355
Do something about it

1624
01:00:49,855 --> 01:00:50,589
(Go ahead)

1625
01:00:50,790 --> 01:00:53,993
I wanna misbehave

1626
01:00:54,026 --> 01:00:55,728
(You)

1627
01:00:55,728 --> 01:00:57,196
Do something about it

1628
01:00:57,697 --> 01:00:58,431
(Go ahead)

1629
01:00:58,698 --> 01:01:05,538
I wanna misbehave

1630
01:01:05,571 --> 01:01:06,505
(Go ahead)

1631
01:01:06,539 --> 01:01:09,008
I wanna misbehave

1632
01:01:09,008 --> 01:01:09,675
Bum bum

1633
01:01:10,242 --> 01:01:11,644
bum bum bum bum

1634
01:01:12,211 --> 01:01:13,646
bum bum bum bum

1635
01:01:14,146 --> 01:01:15,381
bum bum bum bum

1636
01:01:16,148 --> 01:01:17,616
Take the shot

1637
01:01:18,084 --> 01:01:19,552
Don’t regret

1638
01:01:20,086 --> 01:01:21,787
Don’t give a shhhhhh

1639
01:01:22,221 --> 01:01:26,425
I wanna misbehave

1640
01:01:32,098 --> 01:01:35,034
I wanna misbehave

1641
01:01:35,301 --> 01:01:37,002
(You)

1642
01:01:37,036 --> 01:01:38,504
Do something about it

1643
01:01:39,004 --> 01:01:39,939
(Go ahead)

1644
01:01:40,005 --> 01:01:42,475
I wanna misbehave

1645
01:01:44,143 --> 01:01:45,344
Wow!

1646
01:01:45,344 --> 01:01:46,312
Let's go!

1647
01:01:50,282 --> 01:01:52,084
Thank you, Lola Amour.

1648
01:01:52,184 --> 01:01:54,053
That was stupendous.

1649
01:01:54,086 --> 01:01:56,989
STUPENDOUS?!

1650
01:01:57,923 --> 01:02:00,426
Ladies, I have made my decision.

1651
01:02:03,295 --> 01:02:05,264
Khianna.

1652
01:02:06,565 --> 01:02:08,734
Shantay, you stay.

1653
01:02:10,102 --> 01:02:12,138
You may join the other queens.

1654
01:02:12,271 --> 01:02:13,205
Thank you so much.

1655
01:02:13,205 --> 01:02:14,673
I just wanted to say that

1656
01:02:14,707 --> 01:02:16,242
I'm so proud of myself.

1657
01:02:17,042 --> 01:02:19,645
This is my redemption. Thank you so much.

1658
01:02:20,980 --> 01:02:22,615
Thank you.

1659
01:02:24,083 --> 01:02:25,951
Yuhua.

1660
01:02:26,485 --> 01:02:29,355
The Asian Seamstress and Hostess

1661
01:02:29,388 --> 01:02:31,357
with The Mostest.

1662
01:02:31,690 --> 01:02:36,228
You are and will always be a Slaysian Sensation.

1663
01:02:36,362 --> 01:02:39,632
We enjoyed your stay here, Yuhua.

1664
01:02:39,899 --> 01:02:41,500
- We love you always.
- I love you, too.

1665
01:02:41,567 --> 01:02:43,269
Now,

1666
01:02:43,602 --> 01:02:45,738
sashay away.

1667
01:02:47,473 --> 01:02:50,543
I want to say that I came to Slaysian Royale

1668
01:02:50,776 --> 01:02:52,611
not only to possibly win

1669
01:02:53,379 --> 01:02:54,413
the title.

1670
01:02:55,581 --> 01:02:57,383
But also to be seen,

1671
01:02:58,217 --> 01:02:59,785
to find love,

1672
01:03:00,252 --> 01:03:01,787
acceptance,

1673
01:03:02,254 --> 01:03:04,423
and to show myself to the world.

1674
01:03:04,957 --> 01:03:06,625
And I couldn't have

1675
01:03:06,692 --> 01:03:08,561
done it any other way.

1676
01:03:08,561 --> 01:03:10,362
Thank you so much!

1677
01:03:10,396 --> 01:03:12,464
I came here, I got what I wanted.

1678
01:03:18,804 --> 01:03:20,639
We love you, Yuhua.

1679
01:03:20,639 --> 01:03:23,209
I love you, thank you.

1680
01:03:23,242 --> 01:03:23,943
Thank you.

1681
01:03:23,943 --> 01:03:25,511
Thank you, Yuhua.

1682
01:03:27,780 --> 01:03:30,316
See y'all for Season 2, baby!

1683
01:03:31,784 --> 01:03:33,352
We love you!

1684
01:03:38,657 --> 01:03:39,825
I feel like

1685
01:03:39,825 --> 01:03:42,561
I'm honestly leaving here with so much.

1686
01:03:42,661 --> 01:03:44,697
Thank you so much, Drag Race Philippines.

1687
01:03:44,697 --> 01:03:47,166
Thank you so much, Slaysian Royale.

1688
01:03:47,233 --> 01:03:49,835
I feel like a new version of Yuhua.

1689
01:03:49,902 --> 01:03:51,604
I've discovered that here.

1690
01:03:51,604 --> 01:03:53,339
Thank you all so much.

1691
01:03:53,505 --> 01:03:55,040
Till next time!

1692
01:03:55,107 --> 01:03:56,842
Bye!

1693
01:04:02,781 --> 01:04:04,083
Queens,

1694
01:04:04,083 --> 01:04:05,718
as a reminder,

1695
01:04:05,851 --> 01:04:08,787
the Slaysian rules are officially lifted.

1696
01:04:08,921 --> 01:04:10,823
Starting next week,

1697
01:04:10,856 --> 01:04:13,525
the judges' deliberation will return.

1698
01:04:13,559 --> 01:04:16,362
And your fate in this competition

1699
01:04:16,428 --> 01:04:18,497
is back in

1700
01:04:18,697 --> 01:04:20,900
my hands.

1701
01:04:26,372 --> 01:04:28,173
Condragulations, Queens!

1702
01:04:28,173 --> 01:04:29,975
You all made your mothers proud!

1703
01:04:29,975 --> 01:04:31,110
Your mothers are all queens!

1704
01:04:31,143 --> 01:04:33,445
Your mother is a queen too!

1705
01:04:33,445 --> 01:04:35,614
And remember, always be true to yourself

1706
01:04:35,614 --> 01:04:36,415
in your thoughts,

1707
01:04:36,448 --> 01:04:38,484
in your words and in all that you do.

1708
01:04:38,550 --> 01:04:40,152
All heart, always and in all ways.

1709
01:04:40,219 --> 01:04:42,087
Can I get an eme up in here?

1710
01:04:42,121 --> 01:04:43,989
Eme!

1711
01:04:43,989 --> 01:04:46,392
Now let the music play! Party! Party!

1712
01:04:59,805 --> 01:05:02,474
Next on Drag Race Philippines: Slaysian Royale.

1713
01:05:02,474 --> 01:05:04,543
Queens, for this week's Maxi Challenge,

1714
01:05:04,543 --> 01:05:07,346
we're making herstory with the first-ever,

1715
01:05:07,346 --> 01:05:08,847
DragCon Slaysia

1716
01:05:08,847 --> 01:05:11,784
Each one of you must present and showcase your brand

1717
01:05:11,784 --> 01:05:15,254
and personality at your DIY DragCon booth.

1718
01:05:15,621 --> 01:05:16,922
You made me feel so welcome.

1719
01:05:17,456 --> 01:05:19,291
You were so generous.

1720
01:05:19,291 --> 01:05:20,893
I thought it was a really great concept.

1721
01:05:20,893 --> 01:05:22,094
But to be quite honest, I didn't

1722
01:05:22,094 --> 01:05:23,796
feel like I would want to go back to your booth.

1723
01:05:24,263 --> 01:05:26,832
Slaysian Royale format is canceled.

1724
01:05:26,865 --> 01:05:27,833
You are happy.

1725
01:05:27,866 --> 01:05:29,168
Because you saved yourself from the bottom.

1726
01:05:29,234 --> 01:05:30,336
This is good for her.

1727
01:05:30,336 --> 01:05:31,337
Because you're always going to be bottom.

1728
01:05:31,337 --> 01:05:33,105
Well, don't pray that I'm going to be in the bottom, bitch!
