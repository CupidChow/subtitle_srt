1
00:00:01,190 --> 00:00:03,857
Previously on Drag Race Philippines
Slaysian Royale.

2
00:00:04,014 --> 00:00:08,937
It's time for your first Maxi
Challenge. In Miss Shutacca Slaysian Edition!

3
00:00:09,514 --> 00:00:14,186
My name is Khianna with a K, and
that K stands for K-arabao,

4
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:17,678
I have to commend you, It was a
unique blend of masculinity

5
00:00:17,736 --> 00:00:18,616
and femininity.

6
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:21,152
This is Madame Yoko
from Drag Race Belgique.

7
00:00:21,227 --> 00:00:22,995
You look unfinished.

8
00:00:23,195 --> 00:00:26,516
What you should do is find your chosen
family, because that's more

9
00:00:26,566 --> 00:00:29,335
important than anything
else you can have in the world.

10
00:00:29,361 --> 00:00:33,872
It's okay to be fun, to be quirky, but
there's also a refinement. Siam

11
00:00:33,937 --> 00:00:34,323
Phusri

12
00:00:34,457 --> 00:00:37,143
You had one of the
best answers in the Q&As.

13
00:00:37,734 --> 00:00:41,896
Khianna! Siam Phusri! Condragulations!

14
00:00:41,972 --> 00:00:45,576
You are absolutely the
top 2 Slaysians of the week!

15
00:00:45,808 --> 00:00:48,552
Sum Ting Wong & Madame Yoko

16
00:00:48,753 --> 00:00:50,606
you are the Bottom 2 this week.

17
00:00:51,089 --> 00:00:55,018
The time has come... for you to
Lip Sync for your Legacy!

18
00:00:56,625 --> 00:00:57,512
Khianna.

19
00:00:57,711 --> 00:01:02,860
You are a winner, baby! Which queen have
you chosen to get the karate chop?

20
00:01:03,034 --> 00:01:05,237
I chose... Yoko to go home.

21
00:01:05,604 --> 00:01:08,407
Thank you, Madame
Yoko. Now... Sashay away.

22
00:01:17,666 --> 00:01:19,280
Condrags,

23
00:01:19,461 --> 00:01:23,157
Oh my God. Yay...

24
00:01:24,622 --> 00:01:27,826
So, it's a bittersweet moment
because you won.

25
00:01:28,469 --> 00:01:30,862
But then again, you crushed
somebody's dream.

26
00:01:31,012 --> 00:01:33,643
The journey is not finished.

27
00:01:33,809 --> 00:01:34,979
We Love you Madame Yoko

28
00:01:39,555 --> 00:01:42,208
Madame Yoko just got eliminated.

29
00:01:42,341 --> 00:01:47,121
Wow wow wow! This is like a realization
that the competition is on.

30
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:51,291
At first, we're all having
fun, getting to know each other.

31
00:01:51,484 --> 00:01:54,619
But bitches are gonna be
dropping one by one.

32
00:01:54,619 --> 00:01:57,787
Seeing her go is really
upsetting. But hopefully she never

33
00:01:57,841 --> 00:02:00,026
unpacked that suitcase she came in with.

34
00:02:01,627 --> 00:02:03,678
How do you feel, Sum Ting Wong?

35
00:02:03,595 --> 00:02:05,279
Relieved. Like,

36
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:09,309
Thank you, bitch. Why did you save
me instead of Yoko then?

37
00:02:09,659 --> 00:02:12,779
Because I felt like,
honestly, you were doing the most...

38
00:02:12,834 --> 00:02:14,641
And I have definitely been doing,

39
00:02:16,216 --> 00:02:20,273
I mean— I mean, I have
really been doing the most my last

40
00:02:20,344 --> 00:02:23,049
season. So I definitely saw something.

41
00:02:23,665 --> 00:02:27,462
in you that was me. Maybe next time
there is something right.

42
00:02:28,053 --> 00:02:30,514
I gotcha... Sum Ting Wight?!

43
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:35,348
I was just like, oh, my little baby!
I'll be a little baby for

44
00:02:35,411 --> 00:02:36,420
Khianna. Hahaha!

45
00:02:36,661 --> 00:02:39,522
This is the game. This is what
we signed up for, so...

46
00:02:40,299 --> 00:02:41,374
more to come.

47
00:02:43,101 --> 00:02:44,236
Kiss! - Come here!

48
00:02:44,236 --> 00:02:46,171
Let's shake things up! - Kiss!

49
00:02:46,171 --> 00:02:49,207
Siam too! - So you're hugging her?
Whose lipstick did you pick?

50
00:02:49,241 --> 00:02:51,538
Okay. - Yeah! We wanna know! -

51
00:02:52,365 --> 00:02:54,998
I have to apologize that... -

52
00:02:52,899 --> 00:02:54,248
Let me hug her before.

53
00:02:55,089 --> 00:02:56,815
I picked you. - Oh.

54
00:02:57,349 --> 00:02:59,010
Because I have to show how...

55
00:02:59,652 --> 00:03:00,645
friendship is.

56
00:03:01,069 --> 00:03:02,878
Yeah, you were close with Madame Yoko.

57
00:03:02,712 --> 00:03:04,071
At the first day.

58
00:03:04,189 --> 00:03:08,267
First time I see Madame Yoko, I
feel like we really have good connection

59
00:03:08,393 --> 00:03:11,639
and I feel like if I was
in the position that she was

60
00:03:11,701 --> 00:03:13,967
in, she’d probably choose to save me.

61
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,838
I think I need to pick her because if
I'm done from the show, at least

62
00:03:18,896 --> 00:03:23,050
- Yeah, I'm not mad at you. at
least I can tell her that I'm her friend.

63
00:03:23,377 --> 00:03:26,787
Yeah! Truly, no hard
feelings, like I understand. Like this

64
00:03:26,845 --> 00:03:28,463
entire thing's a game but...

65
00:03:29,115 --> 00:03:30,866
you need friends in games.

66
00:03:31,165 --> 00:03:35,121
So now that she's gone... now
we can become friends.

67
00:03:37,589 --> 00:03:39,909
Now we get to know each other.

68
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:43,278
We're gonna talk more,
dance more, dream more, right?

69
00:03:43,308 --> 00:03:43,845
Yeah!

70
00:03:43,829 --> 00:03:45,480
Let's do this girl! -

71
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:48,234
Alright! - Let's do this together!

72
00:03:45,583 --> 00:03:48,218
Alright! - Let's do this together!

73
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:48,193
Alright! - Let's do this together!

74
00:03:49,601 --> 00:03:51,202
- Slaysians, honey! - yes

75
00:03:51,202 --> 00:03:53,046
Let's remove our makeup, alright.

76
00:03:54,206 --> 00:03:56,207
Let's go!

77
00:03:56,207 --> 00:04:00,720
You cried to my face, bitch! And you
had my fucking lipstick! I hate you! But

78
00:04:00,778 --> 00:04:04,060
I don't. Because who can fucking
hate Siam? Look at her!

79
00:04:04,118 --> 00:04:05,818
She's like a little princess.

80
00:04:05,885 --> 00:04:09,374
Yeah, I'm thinking a little bit, right?
That if Sum Ting were like

81
00:04:09,427 --> 00:04:11,490
on top, he probably would kick me home.

82
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:14,527
You're here to play the game,
girl. Okay, okay.

83
00:04:14,527 --> 00:04:18,105
Pray to the mighty God above,
I'm not going home!

84
00:04:18,663 --> 00:04:20,706
May the best woman win. Hahaha!

85
00:04:20,732 --> 00:04:22,576
Okay, we will!

86
00:04:29,675 --> 00:04:33,168
The winner of Drag Race

87
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:36,765
one-year supply of Anastasia

Yay!

92
00:04:59,838 --> 00:05:00,432
- Yes!

93
00:05:00,598 --> 00:05:02,908
- Cheers to being queer!

94
00:05:02,908 --> 00:05:03,588
Wooh!

95
00:05:03,682 --> 00:05:06,487
Ding Ding Ding!
Brigiding in the Werkroom!

96
00:05:07,446 --> 00:05:10,866
It's a new day in the
Werkroom. And I wonder what the next

97
00:05:10,925 --> 00:05:13,285
challenge is. I'm so ready, bring it on!

98
00:05:13,442 --> 00:05:15,620
I finally won something!

99
00:05:15,687 --> 00:05:19,023
- Oh! - Yay! Wow!

100
00:05:19,023 --> 00:05:20,497
We forget you at the back.

101
00:05:20,555 --> 00:05:21,518
Prance, my queen!

102
00:05:23,862 --> 00:05:24,997
Where's Sum Ting Wong?

103
00:05:26,456 --> 00:05:31,012
Oh, my God! For the first time ever, in
the first episode, I got crowned,

104
00:05:31,075 --> 00:05:33,446
Oh my God! I can go home now. Kidding!

105
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:35,040
Never!

106
00:05:35,107 --> 00:05:39,177
Congrats! Miss Shutacca!

107
00:05:35,259 --> 00:05:35,944
Congrats!

108
00:05:39,235 --> 00:05:40,235
Congrats, sis!

109
00:05:40,293 --> 00:05:41,720
- How does it feel to win?

110
00:05:41,776 --> 00:05:43,773
Coming from your season, you know?

111
00:05:43,816 --> 00:05:45,617
Yeah! You won the Mini and the Maxi.

112
00:05:45,667 --> 00:05:46,735
- Mini Maxi, girl!

113
00:05:46,617 --> 00:05:47,319
- Of the Maxi.

114
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:49,579
- That's what happened on
her season as well.

115
00:05:49,042 --> 00:05:49,679
- Now she’s rich!

116
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:51,107
She won the first one,

117
00:05:51,168 --> 00:05:52,386
and then mini, maxie

118
00:05:52,437 --> 00:05:54,293
What happened
throughout the rest of the season?

119
00:05:54,331 --> 00:05:54,980
That's her only.

120
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:55,994
That's her only RuBadge.

121
00:05:56,362 --> 00:05:56,995
Yeah.

122
00:05:57,062 --> 00:05:57,615
- Ooh.

123
00:05:57,614 --> 00:05:59,704
Why are you looking
at me like that, girl?

124
00:06:00,331 --> 00:06:02,376
That could be your only one! Khianna.

125
00:06:02,668 --> 00:06:05,461
Congrats for the win
last week. But this week,

126
00:06:05,754 --> 00:06:09,164
it's gotta be an international queen.
Girl, we didn't fly over here

127
00:06:09,215 --> 00:06:09,775
to be safe!

128
00:06:09,841 --> 00:06:13,308
What about you Arizona, how do you feel?
Were you expecting to be in the

129
00:06:13,357 --> 00:06:13,646
Top 2?

130
00:06:13,804 --> 00:06:16,800
Yeah, but... I'm used to
like, not winning.

131
00:06:18,675 --> 00:06:22,146
I was almost at the Top 2.
I'm so fucking pissed!

132
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:26,191
I want to do better
because I want to lip sync.

133
00:06:26,624 --> 00:06:29,588
I'm excited to send home a queen.

134
00:06:29,946 --> 00:06:31,297
I want that power.

135
00:06:33,232 --> 00:06:34,355
- Girl, I'm like- -

136
00:06:34,362 --> 00:06:37,502
It was horrid. Being in the
bottom, I'll tell you that. So it's never

137
00:06:37,547 --> 00:06:40,506
gonna happen again. And if it does,
then I'll see you later, bye!

138
00:06:42,507 --> 00:06:45,110
Right, Bottom 2, Episode 1. Fantastic!

139
00:06:45,177 --> 00:06:48,814
Fantastic, it's fine. It's fine! These
queens were actually handpicked.

140
00:06:48,881 --> 00:06:52,785
We'll see what happens when
other people pick lipsticks, won't we?

141
00:06:55,119 --> 00:06:56,120
Ohh girl

142
00:07:00,391 --> 00:07:01,961
Hello, hello, hello.

143
00:07:02,427 --> 00:07:06,699
Loosen up your buttons baby Because
it’s time to ring the alarm

144
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:09,201
If you wanna be my idol

145
00:07:09,468 --> 00:07:11,218
you need to blink twice

146
00:07:11,603 --> 00:07:13,439
and put a cherry on top.

147
00:07:13,939 --> 00:07:15,425
Now, how you like that?

148
00:07:15,533 --> 00:07:18,576
- Oh, my God! - We're doing
the Girl Group!

149
00:07:18,576 --> 00:07:20,646
RuPaul is so beautiful

150
00:07:21,321 --> 00:07:23,173
and we’re like, okay idol.

151
00:07:23,732 --> 00:07:24,382
Ahh..

152
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:25,968
Is it a Hotdog?

153
00:07:27,143 --> 00:07:28,787
Girl Group!

154
00:07:28,787 --> 00:07:32,290
Hello, hello, hello!

155
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:35,059
So gay.

156
00:07:36,668 --> 00:07:37,463
Hi, Queens!

157
00:07:37,795 --> 00:07:41,066
Come on, bebe! Come on, bebe!
Give me that after!

158
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,067
Hello, hello, hello Queens.

159
00:07:43,168 --> 00:07:47,362
Well, as you embark on your
journey to be the first Drag Queen,

160
00:07:47,428 --> 00:07:49,891
to be anointed in Slaysian Royalty...

161
00:07:49,932 --> 00:07:54,460
You must hop, skip, and sashay your
way to the crown. So Queens,

162
00:07:54,531 --> 00:07:57,148
are you ready to leap into greatness?

163
00:07:57,148 --> 00:07:58,650
- Yes! - Yes!

164
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:00,826
Alright. For our Mini Challenge,

165
00:08:00,843 --> 00:08:06,294
You will do just that, okay? So I
will give you 15 minutes to slip in to

166
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:09,929
your Cock-Hoe-Nut
looks. So go, grow, and glow.

167
00:08:09,994 --> 00:08:15,134
Come on! 15 minutes! Go,
Queens! Cock-Hoe! As in right now, yes.

168
00:08:16,735 --> 00:08:18,836
Oh, amazing, Queens.

169
00:08:18,961 --> 00:08:22,891
15 minutes to get in to your
natural state. Right?

170
00:08:24,475 --> 00:08:25,810
Pit Crew!

171
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:28,956
The trees.

172
00:08:30,281 --> 00:08:32,836
We will call this
game, “Why Not, Coconut?

173
00:08:32,964 --> 00:08:34,198
Oh. Okay.

174
00:08:34,217 --> 00:08:37,922
And this is inspired by the
classic Filipino game, Kadang-Kadang.

175
00:08:37,922 --> 00:08:41,177
Kadang-Kadang with a K. Kidding!
Everything has a K!

176
00:08:43,135 --> 00:08:46,411
So in this race, you will be running,
and skipping, and hopping,

177
00:08:46,462 --> 00:08:48,100
and hustling to the finish line.

178
00:08:48,167 --> 00:08:50,802
While balancing on those coconut stilts.

179
00:08:50,936 --> 00:08:52,529
We will have 3 rounds.

180
00:08:52,553 --> 00:08:57,746
Each queen will draw a paper to determine
which group they will

181
00:08:57,828 --> 00:08:58,322
be in.

182
00:08:58,382 --> 00:08:59,832
We have Group Cock,

183
00:08:59,961 --> 00:09:01,938
Group Hoe, and Group Nut.

184
00:09:02,005 --> 00:09:04,549
And all together, what group do we have?

185
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:08,336
What did you say? Cock-Hoe-Nut?

186
00:09:08,486 --> 00:09:10,589
Putting nuts on our feet

187
00:09:10,721 --> 00:09:12,423
and we have to run with it.

188
00:09:12,691 --> 00:09:14,259
Well say less.

189
00:09:14,525 --> 00:09:15,961
Cock-Hoe-Nut.

190
00:09:15,961 --> 00:09:20,555
The Mini Challenge is
Cock-Hoe-Nut! I'm gonna speak to Human Resources

191
00:09:20,621 --> 00:09:23,969
about this. Because the name
is very, very rated R!

192
00:09:24,402 --> 00:09:29,007
The queen who finishes the
race first, will win magnanimously!

193
00:09:29,441 --> 00:09:34,274
- Magnanimously?! -
Magnanimously?! - Such a big word! - Magnanimom

194
00:09:34,346 --> 00:09:36,798

Go!

199
00:09:49,994 --> 00:09:52,063
This is a race, okay?

200
00:09:58,778 --> 00:09:59,571
Sorry!

201
00:09:59,571 --> 00:10:03,710
Bernie and Kitty, the two smallest girls
in the group against my long

202
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:06,110
legs. They did not even stand a chance.

203
00:10:06,845 --> 00:10:08,279
That was my first time!

204
00:10:09,447 --> 00:10:11,658
For Group Cock, we have Suki Doll.

205
00:10:13,751 --> 00:10:14,887
Thank you.

206
00:10:16,078 --> 00:10:18,048

00:10:18,322 --> 00:10:20,567

218
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:48,287
We'll wait. Wait for you auntie.

221
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:55,251
Ooh baby, it was a
workout. I'm not gonna lie.

222
00:10:55,661 --> 00:10:57,062
I'm too old for this shit.

223
00:10:57,553 --> 00:10:59,581
For Group Hoe, we have

224
00:10:59,592 --> 00:11:01,908

225
00:11:01,899 --> 00:11:05,610
Yay! I’ve never won anything
before. So winning a round in a race? I'll

00:11:05,662 --> 00:11:07,648
take it. Is there pesos with that too?

227
00:11:07,971 --> 00:11:11,125
No? Only for the... only for the

Is there Sum Ting Wong?

231
00:11:19,217 --> 00:11:22,037
This round is a test of
strength. My opponents are bigger

232
00:11:22,087 --> 00:11:23,522
than me. They're big gay men.

233
00:11:23,696 --> 00:11:25,523
Cock-Hoe-Nut, go!

234
00:11:28,393 --> 00:11:29,695
This is a race!

235
00:11:34,032 --> 00:11:35,799
The winner for the third group is,

236
00:11:36,284 --> 00:11:37,969
Khianna!

237
00:11:37,961 --> 00:11:41,122
Why is this fun for anyone?
We thought it was gonna be a fun

238
00:11:41,174 --> 00:11:44,810
childhood game. No, no, no, no,
no! This is worse than wearing heels.

For the final round, we have Khianna,
Ivory Glaze, and Suki Doll.

240
00:11:49,615 --> 00:11:51,082

00:12:08,961 --> 00:12:10,831
Khianna!

245
00:12:10,834 --> 00:12:12,803
You're a real hoe!

246
00:12:15,007 --> 00:12:16,274
You're a bad bitch!

247
00:12:17,241 --> 00:12:19,027
Damn, bitch! Khianna won again?

248
00:12:19,411 --> 00:12:21,941
Honestly, like, I don't think you even
need the rest of the Filipinos

249
00:12:21,977 --> 00:12:23,994
to defend the coast.
Khianna is just gonna keep winning

250
00:12:24,031 --> 00:12:25,534
everything. You
could have just sent her.

251
00:12:25,687 --> 00:12:27,552
Khianna wins! Again.

252
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:29,955
I'm so fierce, I love it.

253
00:12:30,054 --> 00:12:32,850
You won a cash tip of twenty
thousand pesos.

254
00:12:34,133 --> 00:12:34,965
Khianna wins.

255
00:12:35,033 --> 00:12:36,794
Now for your Maxi Challenge, Queens.

256
00:12:36,861 --> 00:12:39,456
Get ready with your A-Pop fantasies.

257
00:12:39,498 --> 00:12:44,101
Because you will be
forming your very own Girl Groups!

258
00:12:46,238 --> 00:12:50,841
Brought to us by Cream Silk, the number one
hair care brand in the Philippines.

259
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:52,543
Yes! Girl Group!

260
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:56,356
Finally! A challenge that I'm very
excited. I had a great memory

261
00:12:56,414 --> 00:12:59,926
from my Girl Group in Season 1.
It's one of the most iconic.

262
00:13:00,134 --> 00:13:02,053
I'm excited to create another history.

263
00:13:02,453 --> 00:13:03,889
With my Asian sisters.

264
00:13:03,906 --> 00:13:07,271
You'll be writing your
own verses, Queens. Your own

265
00:13:07,337 --> 00:13:11,428
lyrics that will be
representative of you. What your brand is.

266
00:13:11,712 --> 00:13:15,925
And what it means for you to be
a strong Asian Drag. In Drag Race

267
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:16,768
Philippines’

268
00:13:16,993 --> 00:13:18,172
biggest bop yet.

269
00:13:18,441 --> 00:13:23,581
Asian EYYY! Werk!

270
00:13:23,642 --> 00:13:27,028
Of course, you'll be doing your
choreography. And Khianna,

271
00:13:27,087 --> 00:13:29,014
since you won our Mini Challenge,

272
00:13:29,096 --> 00:13:33,963
you will choose your own queens,
for your group. You may choose 4 or 5.

273
00:13:34,032 --> 00:13:36,980
And the remaining
queens that are unchosen,

274
00:13:37,438 --> 00:13:42,518
will unite together. And form a
group with hostility that will be your

275
00:13:42,591 --> 00:13:43,461
rival group.

276
00:13:43,854 --> 00:13:46,297
Okay. I will pick Brigiding.

277
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:47,222
Brigiding?

278
00:13:47,221 --> 00:13:50,241
First. Yeah. Ding,
Ding, Ding come over here.

279
00:13:50,417 --> 00:13:54,806
Next, Arizona Brandy because...
we need her drunk ass in our group.

280
00:13:54,947 --> 00:13:57,709
I'm actually just gonna choose
my Filipino girlies.

281
00:13:57,817 --> 00:13:58,153
Oh.

282
00:13:58,205 --> 00:14:00,264
That's gotta be where this is going to.

283
00:14:00,317 --> 00:14:03,695
Yeah. That's how it's
gonna go. So yeah, I made an all

284
00:14:03,757 --> 00:14:05,759
Filipino group to be... Uniteam.

285
00:14:06,735 --> 00:14:08,036
Kidding! I'm just kidding!

286
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:10,654
I'm kidding!

287
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:12,190
That's about it.

288
00:14:13,182 --> 00:14:14,400
Yeah! That bitch!

289
00:14:19,847 --> 00:14:22,300
And then she picks all the Filipina
girls. And I was like, oh,

290
00:14:22,339 --> 00:14:24,792
that's nice. That's really
cute and really like, that's really

291
00:14:24,831 --> 00:14:27,205
homely and like fair. And
then I look around and I'm like...

292
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:30,975
Oh, fuck! None of these girls can dance.

293
00:14:32,068 --> 00:14:32,568
Shit.

294
00:14:32,626 --> 00:14:36,486
So it's Filipinos
versus... the international girlies.

295
00:14:36,566 --> 00:14:38,422
So... No worries!

296
00:14:38,464 --> 00:14:39,650
Yeah. It's a war.

297
00:14:41,102 --> 00:14:41,836
Okay.

298
00:14:42,062 --> 00:14:43,763
We're really in the competition now.

299
00:14:43,897 --> 00:14:48,193
It's Filipino against
international. So we really feel that we are in

300
00:14:48,255 --> 00:14:49,251
the Philippines.

301
00:14:49,436 --> 00:14:52,903
Tomorrow on the Runway, category
is... Tech Couture!

302
00:14:53,072 --> 00:14:54,445
- Oh! - Oh, my gosh!

303
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:58,795
Tech Couture. So gag us with your
futuristic, animalistic,

304
00:14:58,867 --> 00:15:02,600
automatic, animatronic, moving,
avant-garde couture.

305
00:15:03,422 --> 00:15:07,412
Okay, Queens?
#SlaysianRoyale Racers, start your engines.

306
00:15:07,446 --> 00:15:09,341
And may the best Slaysian win.

307
00:15:09,716 --> 00:15:12,956
Eeeeeyyyy!

308
00:15:12,976 --> 00:15:14,219
Bye, Queens!

309
00:15:14,286 --> 00:15:17,788
- Bye! - Bye, Mama Pao! - Kadang-Kadang.
- Ey! Ey! Ey! Ey!

310
00:15:17,822 --> 00:15:21,738
- Ey! Ey! Ey! Ey! Ey! - Ey! Ey! Ey!
Ey! Ey! - Ey! Ey! Ey! - Ey!

311
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,168
Ey! Ey! Bye, Mama Pao!

312
00:15:23,195 --> 00:15:24,720
Your Mama Pao is so so easy to egg on!

313
00:15:27,432 --> 00:15:29,475
Okay. Let's focus now.

314
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:31,135
Let's listen to the whole song.

315
00:15:31,173 --> 00:15:31,692
Okay.

316
00:15:37,201 --> 00:15:40,879
Rhyming... Asian.

317
00:15:41,278 --> 00:15:43,347
It's a bop. It has an Asian sound to it.

318
00:15:43,547 --> 00:15:48,194
It's so nice! I was dancing
while listening to it. I had a feeling

319
00:15:48,265 --> 00:15:49,461
that, oh, my God!

320
00:15:49,979 --> 00:15:51,222
This will be a bop!

321
00:15:51,906 --> 00:15:52,606
It's kinda slow.

322
00:15:53,091 --> 00:15:54,163
Yeah, it's a little sexy.

323
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:55,469
We are gonna rap and rhyme.

324
00:15:55,543 --> 00:15:56,786
You can do half time.

325
00:15:58,721 --> 00:16:01,733
I love the sound. I love the
beat. I love the energy.

326
00:16:01,799 --> 00:16:03,668
And it's not too fast. It's not...

327
00:16:05,302 --> 00:16:06,070
And I can't do...

328
00:16:07,873 --> 00:16:09,039
You know, I prefer to be like...

329
00:16:10,158 --> 00:16:13,544
Okay, girls. Hey, girls.
How do you feel?

330
00:16:10,173 --> 00:16:11,273
Okay, girls.

331
00:16:10,249 --> 00:16:12,119
Okay, girls. Hey, girls.
How do you feel?

332
00:16:13,544 --> 00:16:14,245
I feel fine.

333
00:16:14,245 --> 00:16:16,081
Yeah? I like the team.

334
00:16:16,114 --> 00:16:17,749
Okay. I think this is interesting.

335
00:16:17,749 --> 00:16:20,851
I think it's good because you
know... they're Filipinos. We know they

336
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:23,774
can dance. We know this. But we are
different. We can bring more

337
00:16:23,819 --> 00:16:26,158
originality and bring
more diversity. You know? Yes.

338
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:26,666
yes.

339
00:16:26,691 --> 00:16:31,042
She started a war. She's picked
all of the Filipina girls in one team.

340
00:16:31,104 --> 00:16:34,398
And left all of us
international queens in the other.

341
00:16:34,398 --> 00:16:37,224
Girl, I don't know if that's
like the smartest move to do, to be

342
00:16:37,268 --> 00:16:39,608
honest. Because, you know, eventually...
You guys are

343
00:16:39,653 --> 00:16:41,639
gonna have an
international queen on the top.

344
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:46,311
She's just set herself up to be a
big target when things start heating up.

345
00:16:46,702 --> 00:16:48,621
We'll see how this goes, but you know...

346
00:16:48,922 --> 00:16:52,158
I think that's making it very clear
where the alliances lie.

347
00:16:52,161 --> 00:16:53,393
That’’s pretty obvious now.

348
00:16:52,186 --> 00:16:52,733
That's okay.

349
00:16:53,409 --> 00:16:57,753
We, as an international group-is gonna be
fucking fierce. Because you know why?

350
00:16:57,808 --> 00:17:01,657
We have all different cultures. We have
Thailand, we have Canadian, we

351
00:17:01,712 --> 00:17:02,152
have UK,

352
00:17:02,193 --> 00:17:05,542
we have the USA, France,
and Australia. All the cultures

353
00:17:05,602 --> 00:17:09,369
together is gonna make a fierce group,
baby! - Let's go around,

354
00:17:09,429 --> 00:17:09,967
Let's go.

355
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:13,612
and look for each other's
strengths and weaknesses. So we can,

356
00:17:13,671 --> 00:17:15,674
Yeah. assign roles for each other.

357
00:17:15,674 --> 00:17:19,696
So we have different roles, right? We have
choreographer, we have the leader.

358
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:19,770
We have Stylist?

359
00:17:20,218 --> 00:17:23,168
Yeah, we can do styling. Do we have
that? We'll all do styling.

360
00:17:23,215 --> 00:17:26,351
Yeah. Leader, choreographer, and also
lyricist. Sum Ting could help

361
00:17:26,398 --> 00:17:29,020
with that. Lyricist, yeah. And
that's the overall of it.

362
00:17:29,177 --> 00:17:32,648
So who is... A dancer or who can dance?

363
00:17:36,561 --> 00:17:39,010
I've watched plenty of Drag
Race. Whoever's like, who's good at

364
00:17:39,049 --> 00:17:41,576
doing this? And everyone's
scared to put their hand up because if

365
00:17:41,615 --> 00:17:43,092
you put your hand up, and you do shit,

366
00:17:43,575 --> 00:17:45,820
they're gonna kick you
out. So everyone's just like...

367
00:17:46,513 --> 00:17:48,946
Are you a good dancer, or a bad dancer?

368
00:17:48,657 --> 00:17:49,819
I saw your last dance.

369
00:17:49,835 --> 00:17:51,900
As long as it's choreo, absolutely fine.

370
00:17:52,043 --> 00:17:55,720
But, I'm familiar with it, but
like, I think, I could probably be better

371
00:17:55,771 --> 00:17:56,231
at making

372
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:59,481
the choreo. But if someone else
could block it to make it look better.

373
00:17:59,523 --> 00:18:01,079
And we can make sure that everything.

374
00:17:59,834 --> 00:18:01,202
We can work together.

375
00:18:01,218 --> 00:18:02,562
Yeah, yeah. Let us work together.

376
00:18:02,598 --> 00:18:05,217
You can do the K-Pop movement. -
And I'll do the placements. -

377
00:18:05,259 --> 00:18:06,992
Yeah, yeah. - The
whole like scenography.

378
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:08,532
Lots of blocking. -
And choreography, okay?

379
00:18:07,139 --> 00:18:07,543
- Exactly.

380
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:12,205
Girl Group is so fun. We have to
dance, we have to do our singing, we have

381
00:18:12,255 --> 00:18:15,506
to choreograph. There is so many like
talent and skills we have to

382
00:18:15,556 --> 00:18:18,069
put together. And it also challenges
us as a group.

383
00:18:18,069 --> 00:18:21,648
And we will have to see if we survive as
a group. So that's gonna be exciting.

384
00:18:21,681 --> 00:18:24,075
Why did you choose us for the group?

385
00:18:24,266 --> 00:18:27,120
Because I wanted us to show them

386
00:18:27,761 --> 00:18:29,715
why we Filipina Drag Queens...

387
00:18:30,364 --> 00:18:30,969
Why we're here.

388
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:31,616
Why we're here.

389
00:18:31,616 --> 00:18:35,111
I chose the Filipino Queens because I
know we'll understand each other.

390
00:18:35,161 --> 00:18:38,213
So there's less for us to
worry. We'll be able to focus on the

391
00:18:38,263 --> 00:18:39,690
challenge better, than worry.

392
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:42,436
In all fairness to Khianna, she made
a smart move. But it just looks

393
00:18:42,476 --> 00:18:44,777
a little, you know...
because it's like team Philippines,

394
00:18:44,817 --> 00:18:46,473
versus International Queens,
it's like...

395
00:18:47,023 --> 00:18:49,425
a cockfight. It just kinda
looks that way.

396
00:18:49,618 --> 00:18:52,669
You could've gotten 6 queens, why
didn't you pick one of them?

397
00:18:54,013 --> 00:18:55,698
Is it because it'd be hard
to fly them over?

398
00:18:57,324 --> 00:19:01,255
I see the other team. They were all
serious. Like they're having a

399
00:19:01,315 --> 00:19:04,888
hard time. But us, we're just laughing
because for the first

400
00:19:04,948 --> 00:19:07,151
time ever we get to speak in Tagalog.

401
00:19:07,659 --> 00:19:10,768
We were all like, "yes, we can
speak our language, " we get to joke

402
00:19:10,814 --> 00:19:11,881
around with each other.

403
00:19:11,898 --> 00:19:16,169
Here in the Philippines, Drag is like
all about production numbers

404
00:19:16,234 --> 00:19:19,600
and all that. So I know that
we work well in groups.

405
00:19:19,891 --> 00:19:20,598
Sisters!

406
00:19:20,846 --> 00:19:21,974
Hi!

407
00:19:21,984 --> 00:19:23,092
We have something to say.

408
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,436
Oh, we’re sisters?

409
00:19:24,886 --> 00:19:28,239
Okay, girls. We have something to say.

410
00:19:28,389 --> 00:19:28,985
Boys.

411
00:19:29,027 --> 00:19:30,225
Say it girl! We're ready.

412
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,743
I'm gonna say it.

413
00:19:32,718 --> 00:19:33,593
Umm

414
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:37,048
- Bye, Felicia! - Thank you very much.

415
00:19:37,282 --> 00:19:38,750
That was the message for you.

416
00:19:39,191 --> 00:19:39,918
Good girl!

417
00:19:40,601 --> 00:19:43,696
I'm just gonna say that we
are... two, three...

418
00:19:43,955 --> 00:19:46,091
PI-NICE!

419
00:19:46,248 --> 00:19:46,958
Peanuts?

420
00:19:47,048 --> 00:19:47,758
Peanuts?

421
00:19:47,758 --> 00:19:48,592
Penis?

422
00:19:49,068 --> 00:19:50,846
We're nice! We're so nice.

423
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:52,296
Oh! Pinays!

424
00:19:52,331 --> 00:19:56,295
What? You can make the
Philippines proud. But we will make

425
00:19:56,364 --> 00:19:57,254
- Asia proud!

426
00:19:56,388 --> 00:19:58,531
Asia and the world proud!

427
00:19:58,617 --> 00:20:00,564
- Wow! - Wow!

428
00:20:00,609 --> 00:20:02,048
We're going international!

429
00:20:02,072 --> 00:20:07,139
You may make Asia proud, but
we're gonna make the universe proud.

430
00:20:06,286 --> 00:20:07,144
proud.

431
00:20:06,306 --> 00:20:07,170
proud

432
00:20:06,314 --> 00:20:07,138
proud

433
00:20:07,946 --> 00:20:09,647
The universe is an illusion!

434
00:20:22,636 --> 00:20:23,552
Hello.

435
00:20:23,994 --> 00:20:24,728
Meow.

436
00:20:24,763 --> 00:20:25,637
Hello!

437
00:20:25,944 --> 00:20:26,997

“Asian EYYY! ” With Maxie!

439
00:20:32,102 --> 00:20:32,946

00:20:49,386 --> 00:20:55,827
Hi Siam, Sawasdee ka, Mabuhay!
Let Siam Phusri serve you all night.

448
00:20:55,894 --> 00:21:00,931
What you did here is just safe. I wanna
hear some impact on all of them.

449
00:21:00,931 --> 00:21:01,846
Drama?

450
00:21:01,425 --> 00:21:02,433
Let Siam Phusri serve you.

451
00:21:01,915 --> 00:21:03,523
Yes. More drama.

452
00:21:03,225 --> 00:21:04,070

453
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:04,617
Yes! Do it.

454
00:21:04,645 --> 00:21:05,611
Yeah, shit like that.

Yes do it, please.

456
00:21:06,478 --> 00:21:11,640
I feel like, sometimes I put a lot of
like man energy during recording.

457
00:21:12,647 --> 00:21:16,226
I feel like if I put more
Siam energy, that would be more

458
00:21:16,289 --> 00:21:18,550
like fierce, more soft, more sexier.

459
00:21:18,616 --> 00:21:24,451
Runway slayer, Asia's top player, Came
to shut it down, taste my true

460
00:21:24,536 --> 00:21:25,636
north flavor.

461
00:21:25,822 --> 00:21:29,819
Okay. If you're singing, do
not you know, do not move a lot.

462
00:21:30,044 --> 00:21:32,258
Sing it with the mic. So we can hear it.

463
00:21:32,367 --> 00:21:33,175
Perfect. Okay.

464
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:37,668
Come take a sip of
delicious milk tea, yeah. I'm a mixed

465
00:21:37,739 --> 00:21:39,803
breed, still got Asian in me.

466
00:21:39,838 --> 00:21:40,956
Feel the beat.

467
00:21:41,456 --> 00:21:42,598
Take your time.

468
00:21:42,648 --> 00:21:46,057
I'm getting a bit like,
disorientated. But I'm trying to smash out my

469
00:21:46,106 --> 00:21:49,170
verse. I know what I wanted it to
sound like. I know I need to

470
00:21:49,219 --> 00:21:50,948
give it some energy and a build-up.

471
00:21:50,948 --> 00:21:51,582
Are we good?

472
00:21:51,616 --> 00:21:53,217
Yeah, thank you very much.

473
00:21:53,534 --> 00:21:57,905
Ni hao ma! I'm Yuhua with the red and
yellow. I think I started too

474
00:21:57,971 --> 00:22:01,559
late, sorry! I know my ABCs so
don't you dare go herro?

475
00:22:01,801 --> 00:22:02,478
Yuhua! Yuhua!

476
00:22:02,784 --> 00:22:03,765
Who's talking to me?

477
00:22:03,781 --> 00:22:06,629
I know my ABCs so don't you say herro!

478
00:22:06,688 --> 00:22:07,566
It's more relaxed.

479
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:10,565
I'll give it a try, but I think I still like
my version better. But I'll give it

480
00:22:10,602 --> 00:22:12,094
a try. This is my verse, not your verse.

481
00:22:12,579 --> 00:22:13,437
I'm gonna take it...

482
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:16,841
put in here. And out the
other way. But this is my verse.

483
00:22:17,199 --> 00:22:22,388
Hello Asia bite me, I came to slay
here. Just landed from space,

484
00:22:22,469 --> 00:22:24,415
and ready for the queer.

485
00:22:24,631 --> 00:22:26,274
Wow!

486
00:22:26,391 --> 00:22:27,611
That's really nice.

487
00:22:27,642 --> 00:22:28,541
That was dope.

488
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:33,390
I just want you to sing the first
part on the mic. Because it's not clear.

489
00:22:33,431 --> 00:22:37,503
I'm impressed because and I'm
really happy that the two of them like

490
00:22:37,563 --> 00:22:41,695
really teach me because they are really
professional and I can really

491
00:22:41,755 --> 00:22:45,887
learn more, you know. About how to sing
better and, how to be better.

492
00:22:46,312 --> 00:22:52,327
I’m slaying with my Asians... Let
me hear you say EYYYYYYYY!

493
00:22:55,412 --> 00:22:56,882
Come on, vocals!

494
00:22:57,053 --> 00:23:00,050
We have a code. When a singer sees
another singer, and a singer

495
00:23:00,098 --> 00:23:03,237
knows that you— It's like when
you see another gay, you're like...

496
00:23:05,982 --> 00:23:08,693
Can I... Go harmonize with my own voice?

497
00:23:08,732 --> 00:23:10,049
Yes. - Sure! -

498
00:23:10,064 --> 00:23:12,484
Can you start playing - Okay. - from
grew out with Asian. Sorry, I

499
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,866
haven’t got much time, I'm just like,
I wanna do this, and this,

500
00:23:14,903 --> 00:23:15,233
and this.

501
00:23:15,233 --> 00:23:16,967
She said, it's not your first
time in the studio.

502
00:23:16,967 --> 00:23:19,046
Alone without you Maxie.

503
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:21,714
Uh, ok! I just want you
to punch on that last part.

504
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:26,444
Let me hear you say eyyyyyyyy!

505
00:23:26,476 --> 00:23:26,935
Yes!

506
00:23:26,935 --> 00:23:28,020
Wow! - Wow!

507
00:23:28,052 --> 00:23:31,685
That's going to be like it.
Me, Maxie, Moophs can sit there in

508
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:35,610
the studio for an hour and just whack
this shit out. I can't wait!

509
00:23:35,636 --> 00:23:43,744
Now we got the power
serve it up with extra rice!

510
00:23:44,094 --> 00:23:45,679
Sum Ting, she's kinda like this.

511
00:23:52,085 --> 00:23:54,522
Sum Ting, calm down. It's
not an opera thing.

512
00:23:55,367 --> 00:24:00,002
Ooooooh

513
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,147
Eyyy!

514
00:24:03,305 --> 00:24:06,000
Okay! Domination Eyyy!

515
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:07,519
Oh, Sum Ting.

516
00:24:09,486 --> 00:24:12,849
I know you have a beautiful
voice, Sum Ting. It's fine. When she's

517
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:15,651
gonna stop? Like, and I
think she wanted to show that.

518
00:24:17,227 --> 00:24:19,942
You know like she wanted to show,
yeah I can do it. Like, I

519
00:24:19,988 --> 00:24:21,599
think she was too... overconfident.

520
00:24:21,706 --> 00:24:22,834
Thank you, girls!

521
00:24:22,853 --> 00:24:23,965
We served it!

522
00:24:24,051 --> 00:24:25,247
You killed it,

523
00:24:25,333 --> 00:24:26,103
good job!

524
00:24:26,536 --> 00:24:29,107
That other bitches better
watch out, girls!

525
00:24:29,224 --> 00:24:32,593
Welcome to Maxie... Challenge.

526
00:24:35,487 --> 00:24:37,223
Brigiding, one, two, three!

527
00:24:37,289 --> 00:24:41,446
Fly high, mabuhay! Brigiding, I’m the
queen-A! Winning, shining like a

528
00:24:41,506 --> 00:24:43,822
star Asian pride, let’s make it clear-A

529
00:24:44,456 --> 00:24:46,491
At first, I was a little nervous.

530
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:51,150
Because I was up first. I was
trying to get the vibe, should we be

531
00:24:51,216 --> 00:24:52,996
jolly, relaxed, or serious?

532
00:24:52,996 --> 00:24:57,878
I just want you to sing the first
part as loud as you can.

533
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:58,706
Fly high! - Yes.

534
00:24:58,755 --> 00:25:00,014
You are proud, right? -

535
00:25:00,063 --> 00:25:00,459
Yeah.

536
00:25:00,568 --> 00:25:01,372
Let me hear it then.

537
00:25:01,406 --> 00:25:04,441
Morena from the Eastern side, Diday
stands with fearless pride

538
00:25:04,508 --> 00:25:08,412
Show the fire of Team Philippines!

539
00:25:08,478 --> 00:25:13,016
Yes! Team Philippines, one more shot!

540
00:25:14,552 --> 00:25:16,703
It's really my dream to have an album.

541
00:25:17,376 --> 00:25:18,255
Photo album.

542
00:25:20,292 --> 00:25:25,777
The funny and the fierce, hear me roar!
Smoking out the competition,

543
00:25:25,858 --> 00:25:26,907
vape couture!

544
00:25:27,113 --> 00:25:27,898
Perfect!

545
00:25:28,364 --> 00:25:33,720
I want to showcase my singing
abilities. When someone asks, "Can you sing? "

546
00:25:33,791 --> 00:25:34,214
I can!

547
00:25:34,821 --> 00:25:36,639
So, Will we like it or not?

548
00:25:36,814 --> 00:25:38,042
I'm not sure.

549
00:25:38,975 --> 00:25:41,212
Vape couture!

550
00:25:41,312 --> 00:25:42,764
That was so smooth, right?

551
00:25:42,824 --> 00:25:43,781
That was smooth.

552
00:25:44,748 --> 00:25:46,316
So smooth!

553
00:25:46,751 --> 00:25:49,498
Yes me, that bitch,
Khianna with a K K for Krazy. -

554
00:25:49,658 --> 00:25:50,821
One more time, sorry.

555
00:25:50,937 --> 00:25:55,395
It has to be sure. It
should have steady dynamics. Like,

556
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:56,636
"Yes me, that bitch! "

557
00:25:56,677 --> 00:25:57,395
Okay.

558
00:25:57,469 --> 00:25:58,629
Yes me, that bitch!

559
00:25:58,737 --> 00:26:01,245
Big bold mouth, she doesn't miss, endless
airtime for this missus. -

560
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,566
Let me do that again, sorry.

561
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:06,052
Do you want to exercise your
your vocal chords.

562
00:26:08,272 --> 00:26:08,924
Go, sis!

563
00:26:10,006 --> 00:26:11,097
Go, sister! Yes.

564
00:26:11,747 --> 00:26:12,648
Let's Go!

565
00:26:11,767 --> 00:26:12,700
Let’s go!

566
00:26:12,802 --> 00:26:17,798
When I stepped in front of the mic, I got
nervous. So I had multiple takes,

567
00:26:17,865 --> 00:26:18,131
but…

568
00:26:18,815 --> 00:26:19,950
I hope I nailed it.

569
00:26:20,016 --> 00:26:20,876
One, two...

570
00:26:20,952 --> 00:26:29,967
Runs! - Oooh! - Oooh!

571
00:26:29,994 --> 00:26:33,395
Okay, girls... Congratulations!
When we're joking around, my good voice

572
00:26:33,442 --> 00:26:35,407
comes out. I hope
you had fun! Thank you!

573
00:26:35,416 --> 00:26:36,342
Thank you!

574
00:26:36,377 --> 00:26:36,977
Bravo!

575
00:26:36,971 --> 00:26:37,671
Thank you!

576
00:26:37,622 --> 00:26:38,183
Thank you!

577
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,879
Take care! Bye!

578
00:26:39,971 --> 00:26:45,543
Alright! Let's
practice and slay this week!

579
00:26:45,543 --> 00:26:48,382
It is finally time for us
to rehearse. We have to do the

580
00:26:48,433 --> 00:26:51,983
choreo, we have to do the
blocking. There's a lot on our plate, girls.

581
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:57,334
It was decided that I do the
blocking on stage. And when the song start,

582
00:26:57,407 --> 00:26:59,931
you and I, we s— We do— We go here.

583
00:27:00,265 --> 00:27:03,435
And Sum Ting do the whole choreography.

584
00:27:08,841 --> 00:27:10,274
You forgot the first choreo.

585
00:27:10,068 --> 00:27:10,975
- No, no. - We'll block— -

586
00:27:10,998 --> 00:27:11,569
I think—

587
00:27:11,601 --> 00:27:12,809
We'll block first, yes.

588
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:12,969
We'll block first.

589
00:27:12,969 --> 00:27:16,128
And while we are doing this, Sum Ting
was like, okay we can do... this

590
00:27:16,173 --> 00:27:17,842
and this, and this... And I was like,

591
00:27:18,892 --> 00:27:23,159
Sum Ting, can you wait? Like just first
do the blocking, and then we do

592
00:27:23,219 --> 00:27:23,880
the choreo.

593
00:27:23,915 --> 00:27:26,449
Wait. Let them choreograph it
first before you learn it.

594
00:27:26,625 --> 00:27:28,921
Yeah, let them
decide first and then we...

595
00:27:28,972 --> 00:27:30,987
Yeah, because if you
start learning, you mix it up.

596
00:27:31,289 --> 00:27:32,423
Should we break for tea, then?

597
00:27:32,456 --> 00:27:32,889
No.

598
00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:34,492
Shit.

599
00:27:35,392 --> 00:27:36,710
It went fucking shit.

600
00:27:37,093 --> 00:27:40,301
Kitty will say something, and
then Sum Ting will cut her off, with

601
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:43,266
something else. And then
Kitty will try to say it again. And

602
00:27:43,314 --> 00:27:46,571
then I'll be like, guys this is not
gonna work. It's too confusing.

603
00:27:46,571 --> 00:27:47,705
You and me,

604
00:27:48,156 --> 00:27:49,840
we need to think about - where we go.

605
00:27:49,947 --> 00:27:52,513
I got an idea, so... Before it
goes to the second, the first eyes on

606
00:27:52,551 --> 00:27:55,079
the prize, which we know a little choreo
for, I'll let you girls...

607
00:27:55,946 --> 00:28:00,533
We know the choreo, we know you're really
excited because it's your choreo.

608
00:28:02,145 --> 00:28:04,171
Too much energy! Too much!

609
00:28:04,221 --> 00:28:05,748
Everyone's looking at me was like...

610
00:28:06,456 --> 00:28:10,385
And I'm like, I only picked this to
make sure we look good, okay? I'm not God!

611
00:28:10,436 --> 00:28:14,364
I can't just all of a sudden turn you all
into the members of BLACKPINK, okay?

612
00:28:14,398 --> 00:28:15,758
I'm a little confused—

613
00:28:15,781 --> 00:28:17,177
We don't have it ready.

614
00:28:17,185 --> 00:28:20,368
One second, no I just mean like,
so, when we're done our solo, where are

615
00:28:20,412 --> 00:28:22,313
we going? Where's the next
person standing?

616
00:28:22,372 --> 00:28:26,744
Oh, we're fucked. We're
so fucked, girls. Oh, God!

617
00:28:27,014 --> 00:28:28,580
As we say in French,

618
00:28:29,287 --> 00:28:34,769
It means like, the choreo is still in
the oven. We will show you later.

619
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,144
One, two, three, go.

620
00:28:38,185 --> 00:28:40,457
P-P-P-P-NICE.

621
00:28:46,863 --> 00:28:51,134
Our choreography session was just
fun. It was just light. And everyone is

622
00:28:51,192 --> 00:28:54,995
well-trained in bars and
performing. Khianna is well-trained from

623
00:28:55,053 --> 00:28:56,282
the streets. Kidding!

624
00:28:57,808 --> 00:29:00,619
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight.

625
00:29:03,747 --> 00:29:06,801
Fly high, - Mabuhay! -
Are we going straight down?

626
00:29:07,385 --> 00:29:08,218
Let's do this position.

627
00:29:08,218 --> 00:29:09,853
Should we do an airplane position?

628
00:29:10,662 --> 00:29:12,648
No! That's too comedic.

629
00:29:12,735 --> 00:29:16,019
Arriving is mother, Bernie for another

630
00:29:16,535 --> 00:29:19,546
My buzz today says
that I will win the prize

631
00:29:21,741 --> 00:29:25,899
We were all laughing during our choreography
because like, this is

632
00:29:25,962 --> 00:29:30,057
a challenge that the judges and the
audience needs to see that we

633
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:30,625
had fun.

634
00:29:37,864 --> 00:29:40,318
- Slaymix! - Slaymix!

635
00:29:41,584 --> 00:29:42,852
Girl!

636
00:29:43,286 --> 00:29:44,421
Oh, my God!

637
00:29:45,389 --> 00:29:47,283
Oh, my God! That was so much-

638
00:29:50,427 --> 00:29:52,696
- P-P-P-P-P-NICE. - P-P-P-P-P-NICE.

639
00:30:01,479 --> 00:30:04,049
Are you excited for
this challenge, - my sister?

640
00:30:04,398 --> 00:30:05,659
Yeah! Why?

641
00:30:05,909 --> 00:30:09,746
This challenge is one of the most anticipated
episodes. Girl Group.

642
00:30:10,548 --> 00:30:12,829
By who? Do you remember our
season's Girl Group song? When we were at

643
00:30:12,862 --> 00:30:14,185
the viewing party. I know! That was fun.

644
00:30:14,185 --> 00:30:17,184
The crowd was screaming. It
was so fierce. I hope we get the

645
00:30:17,234 --> 00:30:18,984
same reaction with this Girl Group.

646
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,658
Now I feel the pressure, Sis!

647
00:30:21,892 --> 00:30:25,015
Drag is about finding the stuff
you needed - on our—

648
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:26,321
No, actually no. I'm just saying.

649
00:30:26,330 --> 00:30:29,394
Because I was holding my tongue on it.
Because it's about team dynamic.

650
00:30:29,437 --> 00:30:31,767
But... Yuhua, the reason
we changed the choreo so many

651
00:30:31,810 --> 00:30:33,536
times is because you kept fucking it up.

652
00:30:33,771 --> 00:30:34,671
I kept fucking it up?!

653
00:30:34,671 --> 00:30:38,186
Then this little fucking bitch,
Yuhua comes up and tells everyone, "Oh we

654
00:30:38,234 --> 00:30:41,026
changed the choreography
like 7000 times. " "It was really

655
00:30:41,074 --> 00:30:44,348
difficult to learn. " I was like, we
only changed the fucking choreo

656
00:30:44,348 --> 00:30:48,025
Because you fucking couldn't get the
steps. It doesn't matter if like

657
00:30:48,078 --> 00:30:52,022
3 people could smash it, if you guys look
shit, we're all gonna look shit.

658
00:30:52,022 --> 00:30:52,656
No.

659
00:30:52,656 --> 00:30:53,523
Yes.

660
00:30:53,523 --> 00:30:54,818
Specifically me?

661
00:30:54,868 --> 00:30:55,389
Yeah!

662
00:30:55,417 --> 00:30:58,732
Sum Ting's supposed to give choreography.
But she gave like,

663
00:30:58,787 --> 00:31:00,389
10 choreographies. So like...

664
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:03,842
Girl, we need a game plan. And
we need to stick to it.

665
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:06,035
You are one of the weakest on the team.

666
00:31:06,235 --> 00:31:06,837
Was I?

667
00:31:06,837 --> 00:31:07,604
Yeah.

668
00:31:07,795 --> 00:31:09,055
Was I the weakest on the team?

669
00:31:09,532 --> 00:31:13,256
Girl, I was focusing on me. I'm staying—
I, I am like— So... Not a

670
00:31:13,313 --> 00:31:15,739
performer and it's
like - I'm known for it.

671
00:31:15,756 --> 00:31:17,023
I asked for you to decide, girl.

672
00:31:17,004 --> 00:31:18,282
I will mind my own business.

673
00:31:18,349 --> 00:31:21,077
Girl, we have decided and you
couldn't do it. That's why we had to keep

674
00:31:21,115 --> 00:31:21,577
changing it.

675
00:31:21,685 --> 00:31:25,089
I couldn't do it? I thought that the majority
of the team couldn't do it.

676
00:31:25,089 --> 00:31:25,532
Nope.

677
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:28,858
I mean, there were changes done when
I also raised that I couldn't

678
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,388
do it. And they were done but, I was

679
00:31:30,444 --> 00:31:31,395
I was one of them— Yeah!

680
00:31:31,395 --> 00:31:34,098
So the changes were done
because people couldn't do the choreo.

681
00:31:34,098 --> 00:31:37,501
But you knew that...
most of us are not dancers.

682
00:31:36,109 --> 00:31:38,591
No, we knew what you would
do in the choreo,

683
00:31:38,651 --> 00:31:40,879
You knew that most
of us weren't dancers!

684
00:31:41,495 --> 00:31:43,882
We need to get started,
time’s running out it’s ticking.

685
00:32:08,823 --> 00:32:10,266

771
00:40:53,622 --> 00:40:58,070
custom from Suki Doll. Very showgirl.
What else can you ask for?

772
00:40:58,428 --> 00:41:00,939
I'm a fan. An electric fan.

773
00:41:01,856 --> 00:41:03,091
Sum Ting Wong.

774
00:41:03,448 --> 00:41:07,137
She is ready for a hand job!

775
00:41:07,771 --> 00:41:10,815
I've got hands for you, girl. Hands in
my ass, hands in my head. Hands in

776
00:41:10,857 --> 00:41:13,568
my titties. Hands covering my private
parts. I've got Lizzo rings

777
00:41:13,610 --> 00:41:16,071
on as well because I wanted
to decorate it. Well, I think I

778
00:41:16,113 --> 00:41:17,448
look cool. I think I look cunty.

779
00:41:18,213 --> 00:41:20,876
Come on, teletubby. Teleport us to Mars!

780
00:41:22,244 --> 00:41:23,878
Kitty Space.

781
00:41:27,483 --> 00:41:32,971
My costume is inspired by the freak
show, the circus clown,

782
00:41:33,064 --> 00:41:36,599
from the 19th century in France. Boom.

783
00:41:36,999 --> 00:41:41,470
All my costume is inflatable. And
my hat, just open like this.

784
00:41:41,628 --> 00:41:43,573
Cirque du Slay!

785
00:41:45,008 --> 00:41:46,725
Siam Phusri.

786
00:41:47,577 --> 00:41:49,646
She's ready to be deflowered.

787
00:41:50,479 --> 00:41:55,533
My Tech Couture is the Queen of
the Lotus. Serving fierce,

788
00:41:55,620 --> 00:42:00,673
serving beauty. Serving
culture. Because I am the culture.

789
00:42:01,291 --> 00:42:05,128
Lot-lotus and friends. Oh, I love it.

790
00:42:07,196 --> 00:42:08,332
Yuhua.

791
00:42:09,899 --> 00:42:11,318
Robo-cunt.

792
00:42:12,535 --> 00:42:16,947
During this Runway, I am
feeling what?! Very extra bootleg. My

793
00:42:17,018 --> 00:42:22,211
outfit broke down, so... My bootleg brain
came on. It went to my luggage.

794
00:42:22,211 --> 00:42:25,583
I pulled out a costume that
kinda looks like a robot. But I know,

795
00:42:25,635 --> 00:42:28,852
the judges were going "What
the fuck is this bitch thinking? "

796
00:42:29,068 --> 00:42:31,769
Artificial Intelligence ! Thank You!

797
00:42:34,198 --> 00:42:35,532
Khianna

798
00:42:35,642 --> 00:42:37,535
She's root-iful, isn't she?

799
00:42:38,135 --> 00:42:42,587
For this Runway, the concept
of my look, is the modern world

800
00:42:42,661 --> 00:42:48,003
meets nature's anger. This look
simply means nature reclaims the Runway.

801
00:42:48,003 --> 00:42:52,450
A white, futuristic vision where
wild beauty conquers the

802
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:53,776
concrete jungle.

803
00:43:00,383 --> 00:43:01,276
Brigiding.

804
00:43:02,285 --> 00:43:06,847
Salamin, salamin, sa
dingding-ding! (A song by P-Pop Girl Group, BINI)

805
00:43:07,224 --> 00:43:11,211
Reflections shimmering, feathers
fluttering. A vision

806
00:43:11,286 --> 00:43:15,349
of duality, where the
physical meets the spirituality.

807
00:43:16,099 --> 00:43:20,820
Mirror, mirror, isn't this the look,
the best you've ever seen?

808
00:43:26,575 --> 00:43:28,010
Viñas DeLuxe.

809
00:43:28,745 --> 00:43:31,097
Fishes, fishes, fishes, fishes!
(In the tune of Misis by Viñas DeLuxe)

810
00:43:32,149 --> 00:43:39,530
I wanna celebrate, our market missus.
Freshly-caught, just like me.

811
00:43:39,555 --> 00:43:43,144
Oh, my gosh! They're alive!

812
00:43:44,186 --> 00:43:45,236
What a catch!

813
00:43:45,361 --> 00:43:47,079
Let there be fish on Earth.

814
00:43:47,296 --> 00:43:50,975
Find the pearl, on the West Philippine
cheeks! Kidding.

815
00:43:54,604 --> 00:43:55,546
Bernie.

816
00:43:58,774 --> 00:44:00,885
This is a kind of metamorphosis.

817
00:44:01,144 --> 00:44:04,434
A cocoon, that
transformed into a butterfly.

818
00:44:04,858 --> 00:44:10,262
Because I am Diday, who used to
be a sweet little queer but

819
00:44:10,353 --> 00:44:14,291
now, is a full-blown queen.
A fierce Diday!

820
00:44:17,193 --> 00:44:19,345
I wanna have in-sex with her.

821
00:44:22,365 --> 00:44:23,600
Arizona Brandy.

822
00:44:24,633 --> 00:44:26,135
I think her lace is untied.

823
00:44:29,079 --> 00:44:34,288
I'm walking like as a ball of fire.
You've never seen Arizona be

824
00:44:34,369 --> 00:44:39,334
this couture! This Arizona has evolved.
And, is ready for all

825
00:44:39,415 --> 00:44:40,392
the Runways.

826
00:44:45,088 --> 00:44:46,916
She looks too hot to handle!

827
00:44:49,725 --> 00:44:50,818
Ivory Glaze.

828
00:44:51,510 --> 00:44:54,015
I'm seeing double! Double D.

829
00:44:55,131 --> 00:44:59,683
I am hypnosis-inspired. I've got wheels spinning
on each breast, and on my head

830
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:04,062
as well. I'm selling it to the
judges, I'm like, you're gonna look, into my

831
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:08,384
wheels and you will let me be safe. Hey,
I’m just hoping anything works at

832
00:45:08,441 --> 00:45:11,323
this point. I just don't want
to be in the bottom.

833
00:45:14,550 --> 00:45:16,316
Welcome back, ladies.

834
00:45:17,271 --> 00:45:18,945
I have one thing to say.

835
00:45:19,180 --> 00:45:20,428
That was yummy.

836
00:45:20,479 --> 00:45:24,168
Eyy! - EYY!

837
00:45:25,736 --> 00:45:29,840
This week you performed as two
teams, but you will be judged individually

838
00:45:29,896 --> 00:45:31,977
by the Lord God, Almighty. No, by us.

839
00:45:32,869 --> 00:45:34,847
When I call your
name, please step forward.

840
00:45:36,071 --> 00:45:37,423
Ivory Glaze.

841
00:45:39,291 --> 00:45:40,059
Yuhua.

842
00:45:42,329 --> 00:45:43,504
Yes, Sum Ting Wong.

843
00:45:45,448 --> 00:45:46,258
Brigiding.

844
00:45:48,293 --> 00:45:50,044
Arizona Brandy.

845
00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:53,097
Viñas DeLuxe.

846
00:45:56,059 --> 00:45:59,595
You, Queens, are the tops and
bottoms of this week.

847
00:46:00,497 --> 00:46:01,898
Condragulations.

848
00:46:01,898 --> 00:46:03,265
Oh, my God.

849
00:46:04,157 --> 00:46:06,535
The rest of you, are safe.

850
00:46:07,428 --> 00:46:09,640
Please head back to
the Werkroom and untuck.

851
00:46:10,173 --> 00:46:12,408
Shit. It's drink o'clock, Bernie!

852
00:46:18,948 --> 00:46:21,318
Before we begin the judges' critiques,

853
00:46:21,832 --> 00:46:22,617
Queens,

854
00:46:22,981 --> 00:46:26,323
you must first answer this
question, honestly.

855
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:28,671
Is there anyone,

856
00:46:29,285 --> 00:46:30,148
in your group,

857
00:46:30,923 --> 00:46:34,106
that was dragging your team down?

858
00:46:34,631 --> 00:46:37,657
I want names, I want details.

859
00:46:38,059 --> 00:46:40,144
Let's start with, Ivory Glaze.

860
00:46:40,787 --> 00:46:45,264
There was a lot of back and forth,
and switching choreography. And that was

861
00:46:45,324 --> 00:46:48,010
mostly coming from Sum Ting.
I'm sorry, girl.

862
00:46:48,010 --> 00:46:49,646
It was Sum Ting, as well.

863
00:46:50,314 --> 00:46:52,548
Unfortunately, we
changed the choreography a lot.

864
00:46:53,015 --> 00:46:54,283
And we didn't have enough time.

865
00:46:54,242 --> 00:46:57,649
I should have just said “fuck it”, if
you can't learn it then... You're

866
00:46:57,697 --> 00:47:00,817
just gonna have to look bad. But then,
that's my fault for trying

867
00:47:00,865 --> 00:47:01,249
to help.

868
00:47:02,291 --> 00:47:03,068
Sum Ting.

869
00:47:03,876 --> 00:47:05,445
I'd probably say, Yuhua.

870
00:47:06,095 --> 00:47:09,726
Because when we did choreography, everyone
had it set, and the one that

871
00:47:09,777 --> 00:47:11,617
was dragging us all down, was Yuhua.

872
00:47:12,702 --> 00:47:15,637
But I was speaking on behalf of
half of the group, though.

873
00:47:15,637 --> 00:47:16,613
They all got it, girl.

874
00:47:17,231 --> 00:47:19,912
I spoke on behalf of
the girls, so I don't think

875
00:47:20,486 --> 00:47:21,553
I should be punished,

876
00:47:22,028 --> 00:47:23,446
because I spoke up.

877
00:47:25,021 --> 00:47:25,740
Brigiding.

878
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:29,867
All of us, the five of us,
helped each other to have the best

879
00:47:29,926 --> 00:47:32,363
choreography for our performance
earlier.

880
00:47:33,055 --> 00:47:33,950
Okay.

881
00:47:35,983 --> 00:47:37,026
Arizona.

882
00:47:37,727 --> 00:47:40,753
I don't think anyone's dragging
us down as well.

883
00:47:41,099 --> 00:47:44,858
I think we were lifting each other
up. Lifting?! Kidding.

884
00:47:45,334 --> 00:47:46,068
Okay.

885
00:47:47,003 --> 00:47:48,570
Now, Viñas, shutacca.

886
00:47:48,713 --> 00:47:50,399
If I have to name a name,

887
00:47:51,182 --> 00:47:55,481
I didn't learn anything from Bernie's
lyrics about her. I just

888
00:47:55,550 --> 00:47:58,046
noticed that it's about trans power,

889
00:47:58,539 --> 00:48:01,376
but other than that,
all of us gave our best.

890
00:48:01,684 --> 00:48:06,350
And that's the answer we want to hear.
Then why didn't we just ask

891
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:07,340
Viñas, right?

892
00:48:08,258 --> 00:48:11,077
Now, let's start the judges' critiques.

893
00:48:11,727 --> 00:48:13,595
Let's start with, Ivory Glaze.

894
00:48:13,887 --> 00:48:17,904
I'm not the best dancer, myself,
so I sympathize. You know, whenever

895
00:48:17,963 --> 00:48:21,152
you got some fear going
into the challenge, just bring

896
00:48:21,211 --> 00:48:23,515
your personality on the stage, because,

897
00:48:24,057 --> 00:48:27,179
sometimes if you don't know all
the moves, at least if you're showing

898
00:48:27,224 --> 00:48:30,255
with your face that you're really having
a good time, it helps kind

899
00:48:30,301 --> 00:48:33,015
of make up for the fact that you're
a bit afraid, or unsure.

900
00:48:33,682 --> 00:48:37,787
I think a bit more stage
presence would be helpful next time.

901
00:48:38,988 --> 00:48:39,405
But

902
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:41,992
on your runway I loved it.

903
00:48:42,758 --> 00:48:44,419
You looked expensive.

904
00:48:44,885 --> 00:48:48,423
I like the thing thats rolling
rolling in the deep deep blue sea like that.

905
00:48:48,865 --> 00:48:51,401
And because of that, this is your score.

906
00:48:53,635 --> 00:48:54,329
Yuhua.

907
00:48:54,584 --> 00:48:58,347
So, I really thought that you came out
of the gate with a lot of energy

908
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:02,268
behind you. And I didn't really care that
you didn't necessarily know all

909
00:49:02,321 --> 00:49:04,706
the choreo. I was
there with you, having fun.

910
00:49:05,006 --> 00:49:06,474
Well, for me, personally,

911
00:49:06,972 --> 00:49:10,211
I loved your energy duing the
Girl Group Performance.

912
00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:14,874
Your Runway tonight, was a
little bit confusing. Is this what

913
00:49:14,941 --> 00:49:19,262
the original concept was, or did you
encounter some difficulties?

914
00:49:19,394 --> 00:49:24,579
Girl, I'm not gonna lie. This Runway
is bootleg as fuck, girls.

915
00:49:25,836 --> 00:49:29,626
So, my original concept was to come
out with the Drag Race flag.

916
00:49:29,685 --> 00:49:33,356
Checkered. Huge. This tall,
and I'll wave it. And then I press

917
00:49:33,415 --> 00:49:35,961
the button, all the cars
start moving. But,

918
00:49:36,378 --> 00:49:40,216
I had to get bootleg and grab
everything that I had in my luggage and made

919
00:49:40,268 --> 00:49:40,682
it work.

920
00:49:40,682 --> 00:49:45,053
You have a beautiful story
behind it, but, unfortunately, this

921
00:49:45,123 --> 00:49:46,745
is what we are judging.

922
00:49:46,791 --> 00:49:47,296
Right.

923
00:49:47,321 --> 00:49:48,608
Thank you very much.

924
00:49:49,258 --> 00:49:51,318
Now, finally. Yes, Sum Ting Wong?

925
00:49:52,503 --> 00:49:53,428
Hello.

926
00:49:53,662 --> 00:49:58,258
It was nice seeing you elevated
and put-together. This kinda reminds

927
00:49:58,325 --> 00:50:01,028
me of like an AI nightmare or something.

928
00:50:01,236 --> 00:50:04,282
In your Girl Group
performance, you started so strong.

929
00:50:04,890 --> 00:50:05,423
But,

930
00:50:05,780 --> 00:50:08,593
it dips in the end. A little

931
00:50:08,986 --> 00:50:10,354
messy in the end.

932
00:50:10,521 --> 00:50:15,024
And also, it's a missed chance that
you didn't sing your adlibs.

933
00:50:15,053 --> 00:50:15,718
Yes.

934
00:50:20,189 --> 00:50:25,260
Your vocals! There's a hint
of Beyoncé. And a lot of Jay-Z.

935
00:50:27,129 --> 00:50:29,064
Yuhua, do you think she's the
Beyoncé of the group?

936
00:50:29,215 --> 00:50:30,175
I don't think so.

937
00:50:30,664 --> 00:50:33,736
I just think that she was
also very excited,

938
00:50:34,131 --> 00:50:37,160
and she meant well. But I just
don't think that it was

939
00:50:37,216 --> 00:50:39,291
executed in the perfect way possible.

940
00:50:39,370 --> 00:50:40,193
Alright.

941
00:50:40,492 --> 00:50:41,760
Now, Brigiding.

942
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:45,715
Filipina power. You guys were
absolutely amazing.

943
00:50:46,298 --> 00:50:50,434
Cohesive. I loved all your
looks together. I could tell that as

944
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:53,389
a team, you were
having a really great time.

945
00:50:53,389 --> 00:50:57,018
In this Runway, you look incredible.
I'm obsessed with

946
00:50:57,085 --> 00:50:58,093
your headdress.

947
00:50:58,093 --> 00:50:58,831
Thank you.

948
00:50:58,867 --> 00:50:59,225
Yeah.

949
00:50:59,291 --> 00:51:01,323
You look great. - I'm obsessed with you.

950
00:51:01,689 --> 00:51:03,700
Why don't you just live
together already?

951
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:07,026
Stop teasing, Mama Pao.
We'll have time for that later.

952
00:51:07,086 --> 00:51:07,959
Thank you,

953
00:51:08,014 --> 00:51:09,995
Brigiding. Arizona Brandy.

954
00:51:10,233 --> 00:51:14,819
For your look on the Runway tonight,
I love it. It's very avant-garde. It's

955
00:51:14,881 --> 00:51:17,387
also very powerful, almost
like a dragon.

956
00:51:17,747 --> 00:51:18,437
Thank you.

957
00:51:18,452 --> 00:51:21,666
I think the only critique would be
the shoes, for me. Other than

958
00:51:21,716 --> 00:51:24,778
that, it's just nitpicking, because
you look so stunning. So,

959
00:51:25,003 --> 00:51:25,581
Thank you.

960
00:51:25,628 --> 00:51:26,671
congratulations, great night.

961
00:51:26,796 --> 00:51:31,514
I really, really loved your confidence.
It really translated on

962
00:51:31,589 --> 00:51:32,861
your performance.

963
00:51:33,220 --> 00:51:37,466
I loved the lyrics, the
performance, the choreography. You really worked

964
00:51:37,525 --> 00:51:41,063
hard for that. It's just
like, you were born to do drag. I'm

965
00:51:41,122 --> 00:51:43,305
teasing! Yeah, that's Mama Ru's line.

966
00:51:42,965 --> 00:51:45,575
Is Mama Ru here? No, don't
take that back!

967
00:51:45,575 --> 00:51:47,242
I'm claiming that as part
of my critique.

968
00:51:47,242 --> 00:51:48,644
Thank you very much, Arizona.

969
00:51:48,644 --> 00:51:49,970
Thank you so much.

970
00:51:50,146 --> 00:51:51,939
And last but not the least,

971
00:51:52,483 --> 00:51:54,349
Viñas DeLuxe.

972
00:51:54,517 --> 00:51:58,882
Your Runway really surprised
me. It was like a reveal when you

973
00:51:58,952 --> 00:52:03,459
emptied your hat and all the
fish splashed out like a big catch.

974
00:52:03,459 --> 00:52:05,644
It looks like you met a friendly seaman.

975
00:52:06,796 --> 00:52:10,899
Tonight, you've shown us that
you really are a star.

976
00:52:11,233 --> 00:52:13,135
I didn't know you could still split!

977
00:52:13,486 --> 00:52:14,620
OMG!

978
00:52:14,637 --> 00:52:16,139
Just for the right men.

979
00:52:16,247 --> 00:52:17,740
You gave us everything.

980
00:52:18,073 --> 00:52:19,872
Stunts, beauty,

981
00:52:20,251 --> 00:52:23,963
and the Viñas brand of confidence,
and comedy.

982
00:52:24,562 --> 00:52:26,448
Thank you, thank you, Viñas.

983
00:52:27,740 --> 00:52:30,903
So based on your
performances in Tech Couture Runway,

984
00:52:31,503 --> 00:52:32,889
we have made some decisions.

985
00:52:34,414 --> 00:52:35,666
Viñas DeLuxe.

986
00:52:37,617 --> 00:52:38,762
Arizona Brandy.

987
00:52:40,436 --> 00:52:41,907
Condragulations, Queens.

988
00:52:42,068 --> 00:52:44,506
You are the Top 2 Slaysians of the week.

989
00:52:44,506 --> 00:52:45,459
Condragulations.

990
00:52:51,180 --> 00:52:51,858
Brigiding.

991
00:52:53,475 --> 00:52:54,102
Yuhua.

992
00:52:56,012 --> 00:52:57,463
You two, are safe.

993
00:52:58,514 --> 00:52:59,524
That means,

994
00:53:00,258 --> 00:53:02,751
Sum Ting Wong and Ivory Glaze,

995
00:53:03,486 --> 00:53:05,754
you are the Bottom 2 queens of the week.

996
00:53:06,856 --> 00:53:09,057
Viñas DeLuxe and Arizona Brandy.

997
00:53:09,691 --> 00:53:13,904
Each of you needs to decide which
of the bottom queens you'll eliminate.

998
00:53:13,962 --> 00:53:18,233
If you win the lip sync. Now while you
queens deliberate in the Werkroom,

999
00:53:18,483 --> 00:53:21,704
the judges and I will eat snacks.

1000
00:53:22,070 --> 00:53:26,117
Alright? So don't disturb us. You may
leave the stage and evaporate.

1001
00:53:33,349 --> 00:53:34,983
So who do you think is gonna be Top?

1002
00:53:35,151 --> 00:53:39,313
You know what, I loved Viñas'
lyrics. Viñas' lyrics were very iconic. It

1003
00:53:39,371 --> 00:53:40,122
was good, no?

1004
00:53:40,122 --> 00:53:42,291
The Runway that I loved was Viñas'.

1005
00:53:42,291 --> 00:53:44,519
Amen. No, I love Arizona's verse.

1006
00:53:45,169 --> 00:53:46,323
What was it?

1007
00:53:46,430 --> 00:53:47,546
Yes. Arizona's verse.

1008
00:53:47,497 --> 00:53:49,423
What was she saying again in the song?

1009
00:53:47,577 --> 00:53:49,432
What was she singing?

1010
00:53:49,465 --> 00:53:50,633
I don't know. Kidding!

1011
00:53:52,153 --> 00:53:52,787
I liked it.

1012
00:53:54,236 --> 00:53:57,222
That was perfect. And who do
you think would be at the bottom?

1013
00:53:57,648 --> 00:53:59,274
I think the Bottom is...

1014
00:53:59,316 --> 00:54:01,693
Now, It's Sum, and

1015
00:54:02,077 --> 00:54:02,778
Ivory.

1016
00:54:02,979 --> 00:54:04,514
Why do you think they are in the bottom?

1017
00:54:04,514 --> 00:54:07,682
Oh, you mean like it was boring?
Or the same silhouettes

1018
00:54:07,738 --> 00:54:09,718
were not really interesting to you?

1019
00:54:09,718 --> 00:54:11,336
Oh, wow, she's adding all of that.

1020
00:54:11,553 --> 00:54:13,293
I think that's your comment, girl.

1021
00:54:12,943 --> 00:54:13,747
No!

1022
00:54:13,805 --> 00:54:17,239
Cause like, well, Oh, yeah.
She was not good, no silhouette,

1023
00:54:17,296 --> 00:54:18,327
very repetitive...

1024
00:54:18,361 --> 00:54:22,832
No, because I could— she's the
one who, like, struggled and then...

1025
00:54:22,898 --> 00:54:27,570
Yeah. The most. You need to be,
like, 1-2-3-4-5. You have to be exact.

1026
00:54:27,570 --> 00:54:28,117
Yeah.

1027
00:54:28,169 --> 00:54:29,390
But in the live,

1028
00:54:29,434 --> 00:54:30,553
It's not like that.

1029
00:54:30,581 --> 00:54:31,546
Everything is not the same.

1030
00:54:31,452 --> 00:54:31,887
Yeah.

1031
00:54:31,812 --> 00:54:34,325
Girl, on the live scene, if something
happens, you don't...

1032
00:54:34,318 --> 00:54:36,394
But this is show
business, you know what I mean?

1033
00:54:36,412 --> 00:54:38,305
Yo, this fucking bullshit!

1034
00:54:38,311 --> 00:54:39,593
Girls.

1035
00:54:39,617 --> 00:54:41,318
Guess who's in the fucking bottom again?

1036
00:54:41,850 --> 00:54:43,193
Could I not just be safe?

1037
00:54:43,660 --> 00:54:44,220
Huh?

1038
00:54:44,352 --> 00:54:47,834
Please, please. Why do I have to
be so chaotic, that I gotta be... the

1039
00:54:47,884 --> 00:54:51,465
judges either loved it or they
fucking hate her and she's going to be in

1040
00:54:51,515 --> 00:54:53,555
the Bottom 2. And that's
happening again!

1041
00:54:54,729 --> 00:54:56,812
Are you gonna be at the Top? Sister?

1042
00:54:56,412 --> 00:54:58,392
Are Pinay girls at the Top?

1043
00:54:58,867 --> 00:55:00,336
And Arizona, I think.

1044
00:55:00,635 --> 00:55:02,296
Yas! - Yas!

1045
00:55:02,628 --> 00:55:04,274
I'm proud of my girls!

1046
00:55:06,142 --> 00:55:07,635
I'm so happy because

1047
00:55:08,602 --> 00:55:13,520
this is a really great chance for
me to show how I sing, and this is one

1048
00:55:13,588 --> 00:55:17,276
of the challenges that I dreamed
to be on the Top. And

1049
00:55:17,345 --> 00:55:19,394
it happened, so. I'm so happy.

1050
00:55:19,419 --> 00:55:20,905
Congratulations, Sis.

1051
00:55:20,979 --> 00:55:24,578
It really is a different
feeling, being on Top for the first time.

1052
00:55:24,633 --> 00:55:26,595
And, I don't know which to focus on.

1053
00:55:26,595 --> 00:55:31,045
I have to learn a song, I have to
win. I can’t just be on top, I want that

1054
00:55:31,105 --> 00:55:31,767
money, too.

1055
00:55:32,593 --> 00:55:33,923
How about you, Arizona?

1056
00:55:33,975 --> 00:55:37,037
It feels nice, because, people
were appreciating my

1057
00:55:37,097 --> 00:55:37,878
look because,

1058
00:55:38,398 --> 00:55:41,220
Like what I've said, I've never been
told, "Oh, my God, you're dress

1059
00:55:41,261 --> 00:55:41,677
is nice! "

1060
00:55:41,677 --> 00:55:45,135
This is my first time
having that appreciation but,

1061
00:55:45,814 --> 00:55:52,354
it also feels sad because we have to,
somehow, end somebody's run here.

1062
00:55:53,555 --> 00:55:57,325
We don't just get to eliminate. We
have to. It's a requirement.

1063
00:55:58,394 --> 00:55:59,787
Can we eliminate two?

1064
00:56:01,796 --> 00:56:05,909
Bernie. We were asked by Mama
Pao to mention someone who we think

1065
00:56:05,972 --> 00:56:09,831
is dragging the group down. I said
that there's no one in our

1066
00:56:09,894 --> 00:56:12,298
group who was bringing the group down.

1067
00:56:12,374 --> 00:56:14,953
She's been telling us, "I
don't want that answer. " "I need a

1068
00:56:14,995 --> 00:56:16,178
real answer. " and I'm like,

1069
00:56:16,345 --> 00:56:20,377
there really was no weakest link, but
if you really want one, Bernie

1070
00:56:20,436 --> 00:56:25,120
was... like, the only thing I
understood from her lyrics was about trans power.

1071
00:56:25,361 --> 00:56:29,654
If I really needed to answer, I mean, we're
in a reality show, I won't give

1072
00:56:29,712 --> 00:56:33,947
some showbiz answer. So, I mentioned who
the weakest link is from my point

1073
00:56:34,005 --> 00:56:34,463
of view.

1074
00:56:34,771 --> 00:56:36,758
No, it's okay. I know that...

1075
00:56:36,827 --> 00:56:38,200
You know I love you.

1076
00:56:38,968 --> 00:56:42,321
Sum Ting and Ivory, I
already knew from rehearsals,

1077
00:56:42,829 --> 00:56:45,800
that Ivory was struggling with Sum Ting.

1078
00:56:46,608 --> 00:56:49,171
For me to decide, like I also wanna hear

1079
00:56:50,046 --> 00:56:50,879
the group.

1080
00:56:50,912 --> 00:56:52,180
Me and Ivory are Bottom 2.

1081
00:56:52,180 --> 00:56:56,063
The problem was, because it took so
many iterations to - land where

1082
00:56:55,577 --> 00:56:58,012
But without me there wouldn't
have been a single fucking iteration

1083
00:56:56,121 --> 00:56:56,584
we were.

1084
00:56:58,048 --> 00:56:58,713
to start off with.

1085
00:56:59,354 --> 00:57:00,448
That's what I'm saying.

1086
00:57:00,957 --> 00:57:05,545
I think the group does owe a lot to Sum.
We wouldn't even have a choreo

1087
00:57:05,609 --> 00:57:10,456
without him. But Sum did
modifications to all the blockings, and all of the

1088
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:13,235
choreos and that
really set everyone back.

1089
00:57:13,501 --> 00:57:18,006
So, Ivory and Yuhua mentioned Sum
Ting Wong to be like least

1090
00:57:18,006 --> 00:57:19,800
By the way, within seconds...

1091
00:57:20,408 --> 00:57:23,273
When the Pinoy girls were asked, who
was in— "Who dragged down your

1092
00:57:23,315 --> 00:57:25,838
group? " they were like, "No one
dragged our group, we were

1093
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:27,932
all fantastic. " And
I'm standing there, like...

1094
00:57:28,985 --> 00:57:32,451
You motherfuckers took three
seconds to throw me under this fucking

1095
00:57:32,503 --> 00:57:36,021
bus. Snakes, all of them. Both of them,
snakes. Bitches. Hoes. Never

1096
00:57:36,072 --> 00:57:38,193
gonna talk to them again.
And without me,

1097
00:57:38,794 --> 00:57:40,771
there wouldn't have been
a fucking dance.

1098
00:57:41,062 --> 00:57:42,913
And then soon as they got the opportunity
they were like, "You

1099
00:57:42,943 --> 00:57:44,733
know what, fuck it. " "Let's throw
Sum Ting under the bus. "

1100
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:47,361
And I was like, we were all
friends here. When it comes to saving

1101
00:57:47,396 --> 00:57:48,787
your own ass, I was just like, oh, okay.

1102
00:57:49,338 --> 00:57:50,347
Oh, I see what you're like.

1103
00:57:50,805 --> 00:57:52,073
I see what you're doing. Okay, cool.

1104
00:57:52,416 --> 00:57:53,157
Play the game.

1105
00:57:54,010 --> 00:57:57,627
It was pretty obvious. The other group took
their time, because they couldn't

1106
00:57:57,674 --> 00:58:01,104
pinpoint anyone right away. We knew right
away who it was. We didn't have

1107
00:58:01,151 --> 00:58:04,486
to think about it. Of course, it
was gonna take less than five seconds.

1108
00:58:04,753 --> 00:58:06,488
I don't wanna fucking go home, right?

1109
00:58:06,856 --> 00:58:11,024
If you want to put it down to who you thought
did the worse in this, and you

1110
00:58:11,078 --> 00:58:14,808
pick my name, I'm gonna think
you're weird for it, but, I'll respect

1111
00:58:14,863 --> 00:58:15,631
your decision.

1112
00:58:15,631 --> 00:58:17,710
If you wanna save for a different
reason, that's

1113
00:58:17,754 --> 00:58:20,094
completely valid, too. You can
pick depending on track

1114
00:58:20,137 --> 00:58:21,870
record. I've already been in the bottom.

1115
00:58:22,137 --> 00:58:23,162
Maybe you wanna pick on that.

1116
00:58:23,379 --> 00:58:26,539
If you want to pick on who you
want to have more time in the spotlight

1117
00:58:26,584 --> 00:58:29,563
to really showcase their drag,
you can do that as well. Or, if you

1118
00:58:29,608 --> 00:58:32,632
wanna pick specifically on this challenge,
you can pick to save me.

1119
00:58:32,677 --> 00:58:34,483
But tonight, it's up to you, completely.

1120
00:58:34,550 --> 00:58:35,684
Because at the end of the day,

1121
00:58:36,318 --> 00:58:39,415
I'm proud of our work. I'm
proud of my work. And I'm proud of

1122
00:58:39,465 --> 00:58:41,039
the work that the girls put in.

1123
00:58:41,957 --> 00:58:43,224
How do you feel, Ivory?

1124
00:58:43,224 --> 00:58:43,912
I'm just,

1125
00:58:44,472 --> 00:58:48,462
like, upset. Like frustrated, to
be honest. I've come in as

1126
00:58:48,529 --> 00:58:51,099
the, statistically... the worst queen.

1127
00:58:51,767 --> 00:58:54,820
You know, I was 8th place on
my season. Earliest out.

1128
00:58:55,604 --> 00:58:57,673
My time last time, was horrible.

1129
00:58:58,173 --> 00:59:01,452
It's kind of
burdened me for a long time.

1130
00:59:02,311 --> 00:59:04,629
I just wanted a chance to, like, shine.

1131
00:59:06,140 --> 00:59:08,142
I just wanna be there one time.

1132
00:59:08,468 --> 00:59:09,084
To like,

1133
00:59:09,711 --> 00:59:10,640
show people

1134
00:59:11,204 --> 00:59:12,070
that I can

1135
00:59:12,539 --> 00:59:14,323
do good drag. And like...

1136
00:59:15,323 --> 00:59:16,557
And so this time I wanna just,

1137
00:59:17,314 --> 00:59:18,561
I wanted to stick around.

1138
00:59:19,461 --> 00:59:20,628
I wanna stick around.

1139
00:59:20,995 --> 00:59:22,731
To show people that I'm not trash.

1140
00:59:23,164 --> 00:59:25,675
I'm sorry to say this in
front of you, Sum Ting, but, I

1141
00:59:25,721 --> 00:59:27,135
hope you guys pick my lipstick.

1142
00:59:27,403 --> 00:59:32,240
Because, wait, no, that means I go home.
I hope you don't pick my lipstick.

1143
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:36,061
I hope you pick to keep me. I think
I've pleaded my case well.

1144
00:59:37,079 --> 00:59:40,348
I have a lot on the line, so I just
need, I just want... Please,

1145
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:42,035
save me, girls. Please, save me.

1146
00:59:46,546 --> 00:59:51,827
I chose this person
because I know that she will do

1147
00:59:52,035 --> 00:59:56,196
better or best outside the competition.
Because she's

1148
00:59:56,275 --> 00:59:59,100
been feeling some type of ways here.

1149
00:59:59,117 --> 01:00:01,586
So I want her to be free.

1150
01:00:04,740 --> 01:00:10,403
It's getting real. Because we really get
to decide. We have their... We have

1151
01:00:10,477 --> 01:00:13,532
their fate upon our hands,
and it's hard.

1152
01:00:16,885 --> 01:00:18,053
Oh, wow!

1153
01:00:18,336 --> 01:00:19,854
Big bad bananas?

1154
01:00:20,289 --> 01:00:25,366
Jimbo, why are your bananas
so, so long? Why is mine so short?

1155
01:00:25,448 --> 01:00:27,823
Mama Pao, you have a problem?

1156
01:00:27,930 --> 01:00:30,983
Maxie, that's not
"bananacue". That's "banana-cute"!

1157
01:00:32,418 --> 01:00:34,202
Banana-cute?!

1158
01:00:35,687 --> 01:00:40,242
Okay! Enough with these bananas! These
bananas are making me hard.

1159
01:00:41,133 --> 01:00:43,128
Bring back my A-Pop girlies.

1160
01:00:47,365 --> 01:00:50,443
Two Top Slaysian Divas stand before me.

1161
01:00:51,294 --> 01:00:52,229
Prior to tonight,

1162
01:00:52,454 --> 01:00:56,832
you were asked to prepare a
lip sync performance of “XL”, by

1163
01:00:56,904 --> 01:00:59,093
Thai-Italian superstar, Silvy.

1164
01:01:00,253 --> 01:01:02,966
Ladies. This is your chance
to impress me,

1165
01:01:03,367 --> 01:01:07,111
Win 80, 000 pesos, and earn the
power to give one of the

1166
01:01:07,178 --> 01:01:09,251
Bottom queens, the karate chop.

1167
01:01:09,515 --> 01:01:11,012
Hi-ya!

1168
01:01:13,867 --> 01:01:15,427
The time has come

1169
01:01:16,412 --> 01:01:17,696
for you to Lip Sync

1170
01:01:18,421 --> 01:01:20,082
for your Legacy!

1171
01:01:22,050 --> 01:01:23,986
It's the battle of the singers.

1172
01:01:24,787 --> 01:01:26,254
I can feel that...

1173
01:01:26,831 --> 01:01:28,423
there’s a lot of tension.

1174
01:01:29,015 --> 01:01:33,470
Arizona, give this to me. You're
not a singer anyway.

1175
01:01:34,195 --> 01:01:37,383
If I lose, it'll be embarrassing.
I'm kidding.

1176
01:01:39,059 --> 01:01:40,269
Good luck, Queens.

1177
01:01:40,494 --> 01:01:42,046
And don't fuck it up.

1178
01:02:49,104 --> 01:02:53,215
I've got the baddest ass
you've ever seen Be your own kind of

1179
01:02:53,282 --> 01:02:55,843
beautiful. Fuck it we're all beautiful

1180
01:03:44,202 --> 01:03:46,695
Call it a win

No need to hide it Show me some skin Be
your own kind of beautiful Fuck it,

01:03:52,096 --> 01:03:55,044
we're all beautiful

1184
01:04:01,188 --> 01:04:01,510

Be your own kind of beautiful
Fuck it we're all beautiful. S M L but

Oh, my God!

1188
01:04:15,798 --> 01:04:17,660
Ladies, I have made my decision.

1189
01:04:19,653 --> 01:04:20,921
Viñas DeLuxe.

1190
01:04:23,323 --> 01:04:28,718
You’re a winner, baby!
