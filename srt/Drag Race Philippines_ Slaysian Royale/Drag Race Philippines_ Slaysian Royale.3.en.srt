00:00:01,044 --> 00:00:03,880
Previously on Drag Race Philippines: Slaysian Royale.

2
00:00:04,247 --> 00:00:05,782
Now for your Maxi Challenge,

3
00:00:05,782 --> 00:00:08,051
get ready with your A-Pop fantasies.

4
00:00:08,051 --> 00:00:10,987
Because you will be forming your very own

5
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:12,155
Girl Groups!

6
00:00:12,422 --> 00:00:14,323
Asian Eyyy!

7
00:00:14,424 --> 00:00:16,926
Domination Eyyy!

8
00:00:17,193 --> 00:00:18,261
Sum Ting Wong.

9
00:00:18,394 --> 00:00:19,762
In your Girl Group performance,

10
00:00:19,762 --> 00:00:21,264
you started so strong.

11
00:00:21,264 --> 00:00:21,931
But,

12
00:00:21,931 --> 00:00:23,866
it dips in the end.

13
00:00:24,033 --> 00:00:25,334
Ivory Glaze.

14
00:00:25,468 --> 00:00:28,004
I think a bit more stage presence

15
00:00:28,004 --> 00:00:28,037
I think a bit more stage presence

16
00:00:28,037 --> 00:00:29,305
would be helpful next time.

17
00:00:29,305 --> 00:00:30,940
Get your popcorn watch me slay

18
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:32,141
Beauty never gonna fade away

19
00:00:32,408 --> 00:00:33,676
You gave us everything.

20
00:00:33,676 --> 00:00:35,411
Stunts, beauty,

21
00:00:35,411 --> 00:00:37,780
and the Viñas brand of confidence.

22
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:40,850
Raise the flag, and let it fly

23
00:00:41,084 --> 00:00:42,351
Your confidence,

24
00:00:42,351 --> 00:00:44,020
It really translated

25
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:45,621
on your performance.

26
00:00:45,822 --> 00:00:46,856
Viñas DeLuxe.

27
00:00:46,856 --> 00:00:47,857
Arizona Brandy.

28
00:00:47,857 --> 00:00:50,259
You are the Top 2 Slaysians of the week.

29
00:00:50,293 --> 00:00:52,562
Sum Ting Wong and Ivory Glaze.

30
00:00:52,562 --> 00:00:54,864
You are the Bottom 2 queens of the week.

31
00:00:55,565 --> 00:00:57,400
Viñas DeLuxe.

32
00:00:57,767 --> 00:01:00,036
You’re a winner, baby!

33
00:01:00,036 --> 00:01:02,205
Which queen have you chosen to get

34
00:01:02,205 --> 00:01:03,139
the karate chop?

35
00:01:03,139 --> 00:01:03,739
It’s...

36
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,341
Sum Ting Wong.

37
00:01:05,441 --> 00:01:06,275
Sum Ting Wong.

38
00:01:06,342 --> 00:01:07,577
Sashay away.

39
00:01:13,282 --> 00:01:15,785
She's definitely something.

40
00:01:16,119 --> 00:01:17,320
I will miss his energy.

41
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,088
I'm so sorry, Sum Ting!

42
00:01:19,589 --> 00:01:21,591
I know Drag Race Philippines is amazing.

43
00:01:21,591 --> 00:01:22,792
The Pinay queens are amazing.

44
00:01:22,792 --> 00:01:24,127
But are we really that bad?

45
00:01:24,627 --> 00:01:25,928
Love you long time,

46
00:01:26,262 --> 00:01:27,497
Sum Ting Wong.

47
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:29,232
- Aww.
- Aww.

48
00:01:29,432 --> 00:01:31,134
It's actually sad, isn't it?

49
00:01:31,134 --> 00:01:33,469
To see your sister go.

50
00:01:33,469 --> 00:01:34,704
And it being because of you.

51
00:01:34,704 --> 00:01:36,806
So, I'm so sorry, Sum Ting.

52
00:01:36,939 --> 00:01:39,609
So, Sum Ting Wong was just eliminated,

53
00:01:39,742 --> 00:01:40,543
Umm...

54
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:42,245
And it’s just fine.

55
00:01:42,245 --> 00:01:42,879
Kidding!

56
00:01:43,346 --> 00:01:45,047
Sum was always the most energy.

57
00:01:45,481 --> 00:01:48,117
Yes, and she was always authentic to herself.

58
00:01:48,117 --> 00:01:52,121
- Miss Viñas,
- she just won.

59
00:01:56,692 --> 00:01:58,628
I think this is a validation of

60
00:01:58,628 --> 00:02:00,096
my drag and my artistry,

61
00:02:00,096 --> 00:02:02,198
so this really means a lot to me.

62
00:02:02,198 --> 00:02:03,166
So,

63
00:02:03,166 --> 00:02:05,434
- I'm so happy.
- Yas!

64
00:02:05,668 --> 00:02:07,937
Not only that, you were so funny during the lip sync.

65
00:02:07,937 --> 00:02:09,305
When you pulled out the middle finger.

66
00:02:09,305 --> 00:02:11,440
- But Ari did amazing, too.
- Thank you.

67
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,108
Yes.

68
00:02:12,108 --> 00:02:13,242
The bang?

69
00:02:13,242 --> 00:02:15,044
- The reveal?
-  Yeah, the bang. The reveals.

70
00:02:15,044 --> 00:02:16,379
- The bang, and then the bang-taking.
- The pearls!

71
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:18,881
I want a RuMatch with Viñas DeLuxe.

72
00:02:18,881 --> 00:02:20,950
‘Cause I want that RuBadge.

73
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:22,552
- And which lipstick did you take?
- Prop queen.

74
00:02:23,352 --> 00:02:24,587
- Okay.
- Oh.

75
00:02:24,587 --> 00:02:25,821
Here we go.

76
00:02:25,821 --> 00:02:26,789
Don't even try.

77
00:02:26,789 --> 00:02:28,357
Show it, girl. We can handle it.

78
00:02:28,357 --> 00:02:29,258
We're all adults.

79
00:02:29,425 --> 00:02:31,027
Okay, I love you, but...

80
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,962
I chose Sum Ting as well.

81
00:02:32,962 --> 00:02:33,863
Why?

82
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:36,566
I chose her because of the track record.

83
00:02:36,666 --> 00:02:38,834
I felt like Ivory has

84
00:02:38,834 --> 00:02:40,436
more conviction,

85
00:02:40,436 --> 00:02:43,072
really wanted to stay and learn.

86
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:44,473
However, in this competition,

87
00:02:44,473 --> 00:02:45,875
we’re not here to learn.

88
00:02:46,309 --> 00:02:48,411
- I really appreciate it.
- I know you're gonna do amazing, so...

89
00:02:49,011 --> 00:02:49,879
Please do.

90
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:50,546
Thank you.

91
00:02:50,546 --> 00:02:51,714
And I'll remember this.

92
00:02:51,981 --> 00:02:54,116
I don't know what kind of thing is rushing over me

93
00:02:54,116 --> 00:02:55,918
but I kinda feel like, so much relief.

94
00:02:55,918 --> 00:02:57,353
I feel like I've just been cleansed.

95
00:02:57,353 --> 00:02:58,854
Let's call it a day.

96
00:02:58,921 --> 00:03:01,157
- Let's de-drag, girls.
- It's been a long day.

97
00:03:01,924 --> 00:03:03,826
- Sister.
- Yes.

98
00:03:03,826 --> 00:03:07,797
What a great episode.

99
00:03:07,797 --> 00:03:09,899
Sum Ting Wong.

100
00:03:09,899 --> 00:03:11,601
Goodbye to you.

101
00:03:12,001 --> 00:03:14,036
My game plan is to focus

102
00:03:14,036 --> 00:03:15,638
because I almost had it.

103
00:03:15,638 --> 00:03:17,673
I'm here to prove to myself that

104
00:03:17,673 --> 00:03:18,574
I can do it.

105
00:03:18,574 --> 00:03:19,742
I’m on Top, so,

106
00:03:19,742 --> 00:03:21,010
I don't wanna come down.

107
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:22,178
No, no, no.

108
00:03:22,545 --> 00:03:23,646
This is your redemption.

109
00:03:23,646 --> 00:03:25,281
I know, this is my redemption.

110
00:03:25,481 --> 00:03:26,282
So you're happy?

111
00:03:26,415 --> 00:03:28,584
You're happy if you get eliminated next week?

112
00:03:28,751 --> 00:03:30,553
- Yeah, well...
- No...

113
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:40,596
The winner of Drag Race Philippines: Slaysian Royale

114
00:03:40,596 --> 00:03:41,931
will receive a one-year supply of

00:03:41,931 --> 00:03:43,799

A coveted spot on the Drag Race Slaysian Hall of Fame.

117
00:03:47,069 --> 00:03:48,504

It's a brand new Ding!

125
00:04:10,393 --> 00:04:14,196
Welcome to the Werkroom of Slaysian Royale!

126
00:04:14,297 --> 00:04:15,798
Good day, good day, good day!

127
00:04:15,798 --> 00:04:18,401
It's a new week in the Werkroom.

128
00:04:18,401 --> 00:04:19,969
I feel like a lion, because

129
00:04:19,969 --> 00:04:22,972
I really want to be in the Top.

130
00:04:22,972 --> 00:04:25,441
- And may the best...
- International queen...

131
00:04:25,441 --> 00:04:28,678
- win!
- We fucked that up like the Girl Group Challenge, girl.

132
00:04:28,678 --> 00:04:32,615
Last week was fucking draining, girl, like,

133
00:04:32,615 --> 00:04:35,785
I'm just trying to pull myself back together.

134
00:04:40,122 --> 00:04:43,893
I have a RuBagde now, misis!

135
00:04:43,893 --> 00:04:45,194
And I feel like,

136
00:04:45,194 --> 00:04:47,163
the queens seem happy that I got a RuBadge.

137
00:04:47,163 --> 00:04:48,431
Or so I think they are.

138
00:04:48,431 --> 00:04:48,998
Is it true?

139
00:04:48,998 --> 00:04:51,000
What are they saying in their confessionals?

140
00:04:52,134 --> 00:04:53,903
Me, I'm less in my head now

141
00:04:53,903 --> 00:04:55,471
because she said "Don't think too much."

142
00:04:56,072 --> 00:04:57,640
"You're a bit like, at the back."

143
00:04:57,973 --> 00:05:00,743
You kind of...faded.

144
00:05:01,143 --> 00:05:03,079
So, I want to be in the front, I want to be on Top.

145
00:05:03,379 --> 00:05:05,348
So now, Kitty is out!

146
00:05:05,548 --> 00:05:07,683
- Yeah, you'll be out now.
- Out?!

147
00:05:07,683 --> 00:05:08,451
Bye!

148
00:05:08,451 --> 00:05:10,286
Oh, wow, Khianna!

149
00:05:10,286 --> 00:05:10,786
I want this.

150
00:05:10,786 --> 00:05:12,088
I don't wanna go home now.

151
00:05:12,088 --> 00:05:12,888
I want to be in the Top.

152
00:05:12,888 --> 00:05:14,423
I wanna impress the judges.

153
00:05:14,423 --> 00:05:16,959
And I want to make me proud, and Mama Pao proud.

154
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:19,462
And I think it's the international girls' time to win.

155
00:05:19,829 --> 00:05:20,463
You know?

156
00:05:20,463 --> 00:05:22,631
- We can send one of these Pinay queens away.
- No.

157
00:05:22,631 --> 00:05:25,735
So do you think it's gonna be an international girl that's gonna be on Top this week?

158
00:05:25,735 --> 00:05:27,336
Yes! It's gonna be me.

159
00:05:27,536 --> 00:05:28,637
There's a pattern.

160
00:05:28,637 --> 00:05:30,840
The international queens are leaving,

161
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,509
from time to time, so that's the goal.

162
00:05:34,744 --> 00:05:36,479
We are like, now even, finally.

163
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,180
- Right? Five, five.
- Five, five.

164
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:39,482
Everything's even.

165
00:05:39,849 --> 00:05:41,183
So we have to score down.

166
00:05:41,183 --> 00:05:42,718
Now the next one that goes off,

167
00:05:42,718 --> 00:05:44,353
is gonna be you know, the balance.

168
00:05:44,954 --> 00:05:45,621
Uhm...

169
00:05:46,188 --> 00:05:47,957
What am I supposed to do?

170
00:05:47,957 --> 00:05:49,525
The Pinay queens are good.

171
00:05:50,626 --> 00:05:52,628
Filipinos are fierce competitors

172
00:05:52,628 --> 00:05:54,230
that won’t go down without a fight, so...

173
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:55,731
I hope they step it up.

174
00:05:55,965 --> 00:05:56,499
Kidding!

175
00:06:00,169 --> 00:06:02,571
She already done had her herses!

176
00:06:03,339 --> 00:06:04,807
Holy Cacao!

177
00:06:05,608 --> 00:06:08,644
If you wanna melt the competition sweetie,

178
00:06:09,211 --> 00:06:13,783
you need to serve some rich delicious haute couture.

179
00:06:14,183 --> 00:06:15,017
And then...

180
00:06:15,317 --> 00:06:18,554
leaf it all on the Runway.

181
00:06:20,956 --> 00:06:21,757
Competition!

182
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:25,060
Haller, haller, haller!

183
00:06:25,761 --> 00:06:27,530
She's in cacao colors!

184
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:30,266
Oh, my God, that outfit's amazing!

185
00:06:33,068 --> 00:06:34,837
Holy cow!

186
00:06:34,937 --> 00:06:37,273
Only ten cows left.

187
00:06:38,274 --> 00:06:40,776
- Moo.
- Just kidding!

188
00:06:40,876 --> 00:06:42,478
Only ten of you left.

189
00:06:42,478 --> 00:06:43,345
Yeah.

190
00:06:43,345 --> 00:06:44,380
It's bittersweet, you know?

191
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:45,648
But as they say,

192
00:06:45,648 --> 00:06:48,717
One queen's loss, is another queen's sugar rush.

193
00:06:48,717 --> 00:06:50,653
- Oh.
- Oh.

194
00:06:50,653 --> 00:06:53,456
So let's sprinkle it with sweetness,

195
00:06:53,456 --> 00:06:56,725
and let's celebrate for the queens who remain!

196
00:06:56,725 --> 00:06:58,961
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

197
00:06:58,961 --> 00:07:01,096
And let's get this celebration started!

198
00:07:01,096 --> 00:07:02,331
For our Mini Challenge,

199
00:07:02,331 --> 00:07:04,834
we are going to play Kep Kep Boobay!

200
00:07:05,034 --> 00:07:06,735
Okay, what is that?

201
00:07:06,735 --> 00:07:07,570
Secret! I'll—

202
00:07:09,505 --> 00:07:10,873
Kep Kep Boobay?

203
00:07:10,873 --> 00:07:11,707
It's iconic.

204
00:07:11,707 --> 00:07:14,243
Hip Hip Hooray, is already a big part of our culture.

205
00:07:14,243 --> 00:07:15,678
I'll explain it to you later.

206
00:07:15,678 --> 00:07:19,682
I'll give you 15 minutes to get in your Sexy Swimwear quick drag.

207
00:07:21,016 --> 00:07:22,218
Alright, Queens.

208
00:07:22,218 --> 00:07:25,087
- Go! Come on, go!
- Let's go!

209
00:07:32,194 --> 00:07:33,128
Alright, Queens.

210
00:07:33,128 --> 00:07:35,130
This is a fast-paced challenge, okay?

211
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:37,800
We'll be testing your coordination, your memory,

212
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,668
and your quick reflexes.

213
00:07:39,869 --> 00:07:41,971
I'm good with learning.

214
00:07:41,971 --> 00:07:42,872
A-student.

215
00:07:42,872 --> 00:07:43,739
But coordination?

216
00:07:43,739 --> 00:07:44,773
We'll see about that.

217
00:07:45,074 --> 00:07:46,775
And to demonstrate how it's done...

218
00:07:46,909 --> 00:07:48,310
Oh, Pit Crew!

219
00:07:55,985 --> 00:07:57,152
So, like this.

220
00:07:57,286 --> 00:07:58,254
Here's how it works.

221
00:07:58,454 --> 00:08:01,824
When I say Kep Kep, you will touch your flower.

222
00:08:01,824 --> 00:08:02,558
Like this.

223
00:08:02,825 --> 00:08:03,926
When I say Boobay,

224
00:08:03,926 --> 00:08:06,128
you’ll touch your boobies with both of your hands, alright?

225
00:08:06,128 --> 00:08:06,962
Kep Kep

226
00:08:06,962 --> 00:08:07,329
Boobay

227
00:08:07,329 --> 00:08:09,865
If you mess up the order, or the action, you're out.

228
00:08:09,865 --> 00:08:12,034
So this is a brand new game for me.

229
00:08:12,034 --> 00:08:13,569
I've never played it before.

230
00:08:13,569 --> 00:08:15,938
But the way that I remember Kep Kep Boobay is...

231
00:08:15,938 --> 00:08:17,806
“Boobay” it kinda sounds like boobie.

232
00:08:17,907 --> 00:08:19,074
And “Kep Kep” is,

233
00:08:19,642 --> 00:08:22,278
I've kept this for 35 years, so I'm keeping it.

234
00:08:22,711 --> 00:08:25,347
Are you ready to play, Kep Kep Boobay?

235
00:08:25,381 --> 00:08:27,082
YES!

236
00:08:27,082 --> 00:08:28,417
Alright! Here we go.

237
00:08:29,151 --> 00:08:29,852
Kep Kep

238
00:08:29,852 --> 00:08:30,553
Boobay

239
00:08:30,553 --> 00:08:31,120
Kep Kep

240
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:31,987
Boobay

241
00:08:31,987 --> 00:08:32,688
Kep Kep

242
00:08:32,688 --> 00:08:33,289
Boobay

243
00:08:33,289 --> 00:08:34,056
Kep Kep

244
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:34,957
Kep—

245
00:08:34,957 --> 00:08:35,491
Oh, Boobay!

246
00:08:35,824 --> 00:08:39,562
- Oh, Yuhua, what? Why?
- Bitch, why would you do this to me? Why?

247
00:08:39,562 --> 00:08:41,263
I am an early out.

248
00:08:41,263 --> 00:08:42,131
This is a set up.

249
00:08:42,131 --> 00:08:43,899
Mama Pao, why would you do this?

250
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:44,733
Next.

251
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:45,434
Kep Kep

252
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:46,302
Boobay

253
00:08:46,435 --> 00:08:47,202
Kep Kep

254
00:08:47,236 --> 00:08:47,770
Boobay

255
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:48,804
Boobay

256
00:08:51,507 --> 00:08:54,410
I haven't had coffee yet, that time, probably.

257
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:56,045
I wanted to be the winner.

258
00:08:57,079 --> 00:08:57,680
Kep Kep

259
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,280
Boobay

260
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:58,948
Kep Kep

261
00:08:58,948 --> 00:08:59,648
Boobay

262
00:08:59,648 --> 00:09:00,349
Kep Kep

263
00:09:00,349 --> 00:09:01,050
Kep—

264
00:09:04,153 --> 00:09:05,888
I got the wrong body part.

265
00:09:05,888 --> 00:09:06,922
Who would've thought?

266
00:09:07,056 --> 00:09:07,923
And I'm out!

267
00:09:08,123 --> 00:09:08,857
Alright.

268
00:09:09,058 --> 00:09:09,825
Kep Kep

269
00:09:09,825 --> 00:09:10,526

270
00:09:10,526 --> 00:09:11,126
Kep Kep

272
00:09:12,494 --> 00:09:12,828
Boo—

273
00:09:12,828 --> 00:09:13,262
Kep Kep

274
00:09:14,496 --> 00:09:16,799
What a waste!

275
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:18,100
I just gave them a chance.

276
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:18,934
I did it on purpose.

277
00:09:18,934 --> 00:09:19,468
I'm kidding!

278
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:21,503
Kep Kep

279
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:22,137
Boobay

280
00:09:22,504 --> 00:09:22,938

285
00:09:29,044 --> 00:09:30,746
Kep Kep, Boobay!

286
00:09:30,746 --> 00:09:33,916
I don't know what the fuck is going on but it's fun.

287
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:34,617
Kep Kep

288
00:09:35,117 --> 00:09:35,651

291
00:09:37,219 --> 00:09:38,320
Why are you so serious?!

292
00:09:39,622 --> 00:09:40,356
Boobay?

293
00:09:40,756 --> 00:09:41,624
Bitch got slapped!

294
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:44,526
Okay, just stay on your lane.

295
00:09:44,593 --> 00:09:46,128
We'll call you when we need you.

296
00:09:46,128 --> 00:09:47,363
Right? Versex?

297
00:09:47,763 --> 00:09:48,464

298
00:09:48,597 --> 00:09:49,264

303
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,267
- Kep Kep.
- Fuck this.

304
00:09:52,401 --> 00:09:52,968
BOOBAY!

305
00:09:53,202 --> 00:09:53,836

308
00:09:59,842 --> 00:10:00,576
It's over.

309
00:10:00,743 --> 00:10:03,278
Auntie Kitty, you can do it!

310
00:10:03,445 --> 00:10:03,979

Kep Kep, Boobay, Kep Kep, Boobay, Kep Kep, Boobay

322
00:10:19,028 --> 00:10:20,796
I had so much fun because

323
00:10:20,796 --> 00:10:23,365
I don't know why I took this stupid voice, like,

324
00:10:23,365 --> 00:10:24,166
Kep Kep, Boobay

325
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,067

Kep Kep, Boobay!

329
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:29,672
Kitty is holding on for dear life

330
00:10:29,672 --> 00:10:31,573
and she was so funny the whole time.

331
00:10:31,774 --> 00:10:32,274
She's like,

332
00:10:32,274 --> 00:10:34,176
"Kep Kep, Boobay, Kep Kep, Boobay"

333
00:10:34,343 --> 00:10:35,678
This is the 2nd round,

334
00:10:35,678 --> 00:10:36,712
the Grand Finals.

335
00:10:36,712 --> 00:10:38,981
When I say Kep Kep, you go like this.

336
00:10:39,848 --> 00:10:40,849
Oh, they're switching it up.

337
00:10:41,016 --> 00:10:43,118
- Change it up, girl.
- Change it up, yeah.

338
00:10:43,252 --> 00:10:44,219
Change it up, alright.

339
00:10:44,219 --> 00:10:44,820
Okay.

What?

351
00:11:00,602 --> 00:11:01,103
Out!

352
00:11:02,938 --> 00:11:05,240
Mama Pao changed it, so,

353
00:11:05,274 --> 00:11:06,642
it's Mama Pao's fault.

354
00:11:08,143 --> 00:11:08,744

Khianna!

363
00:11:17,419 --> 00:11:18,120
What the fuck?

364
00:11:18,487 --> 00:11:19,788
Why was it changed?!

365
00:11:19,788 --> 00:11:20,489
I mean shit.

366
00:11:20,489 --> 00:11:21,824
They shouldn't have changed it.

367
00:11:22,224 --> 00:11:23,058
Here we go.

368
00:11:24,426 --> 00:11:24,893

- Yay!
- Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding!

373
00:11:30,699 --> 00:11:31,934
Auntie Kitty was great.

374
00:11:31,934 --> 00:11:33,335
You should come with me one time.

375
00:11:33,335 --> 00:11:36,138
We can go to festivals in Mandaluyong.

376
00:11:36,138 --> 00:11:37,706
They will love you there!

377
00:11:38,907 --> 00:11:41,210
And the winner of our Mini Challenge is...

378
00:11:41,844 --> 00:11:44,012
Brigiding ding ding ding ding!

379
00:11:44,847 --> 00:11:47,516
Oh, my God, Sis, congratulations!

380
00:11:47,516 --> 00:11:49,852
You finally won something!

381
00:11:49,852 --> 00:11:51,153
And because of that...

382
00:11:51,754 --> 00:11:53,021
you can have Sum Ting Wong.

383
00:11:53,021 --> 00:11:53,522
Kidding!

384
00:11:54,256 --> 00:11:57,493
Condragulations, you won a cash tip of 20,000 pesos.

385
00:11:57,493 --> 00:11:59,128
Wow!

386
00:11:59,762 --> 00:12:03,232
You won’t be able to have your pussy or boobies done with 20,000 pesos.

387
00:12:03,232 --> 00:12:04,366
But, this is still good.

388
00:12:04,533 --> 00:12:06,301
I'm still grateful. Thank you.

389
00:12:06,735 --> 00:12:08,704
Queens, for this week's Maxi Challenge,

390
00:12:08,704 --> 00:12:12,608
we're going to honor our local farmers in a truly unique way.

391
00:12:12,608 --> 00:12:15,110
You'll be creating jaw-dropping couture looks

392
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:17,613
using fossilized cacao leaves.

393
00:12:18,447 --> 00:12:23,085
made for you by the farmers of Barangay Paquibato of Davao City,

394
00:12:23,085 --> 00:12:25,454
of the Philippines!

395
00:12:26,588 --> 00:12:29,391
A Design Challenge? For me?

396
00:12:29,391 --> 00:12:30,359
Pit Crew!

397
00:12:30,626 --> 00:12:33,896
- Pit Crew! Pit Crew! Pit Crew!
- Eyyy!

398
00:12:34,029 --> 00:12:35,364
- Wow!
- Pit Crew!

399
00:12:35,597 --> 00:12:38,300
The Design Challenge episode is the one I went home on, last time.

400
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,701
So, I'm thinking to myself...

401
00:12:40,669 --> 00:12:41,170
Cool.

402
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:44,573
Auro Chocolate, a proudly Filipino tree-to-bar chocolate brand,

403
00:12:44,573 --> 00:12:47,009
is blending Filipino craftsmanship

404
00:12:47,009 --> 00:12:48,243
with conscious design

405
00:12:48,243 --> 00:12:52,080
to show us that fashion and sustainability can sashay together

406
00:12:52,414 --> 00:12:53,282
perfectly.

407
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,785
These fossilized cacao leaves

408
00:12:56,785 --> 00:12:59,955
were handcrafted especially for you, Queens.

409
00:13:00,622 --> 00:13:02,691
So there are over 9,000 pieces

410
00:13:02,691 --> 00:13:05,694
and each of you will receive 900 each.

411
00:13:05,894 --> 00:13:08,564
Each leaf was carefully created by collecting

412
00:13:08,564 --> 00:13:09,798
real cacao leaves

413
00:13:09,798 --> 00:13:12,634
and treating them to preserve their natural structure.

414
00:13:13,101 --> 00:13:15,537
From their farms to your hands,

415
00:13:15,871 --> 00:13:17,406
these fossilized cacao leaves

416
00:13:17,406 --> 00:13:18,540
are now yours

417
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:21,710
for you to transform into striking works of art and couture.

418
00:13:22,044 --> 00:13:23,979
I'm really confident with this challenge

419
00:13:23,979 --> 00:13:25,280
because in France, in Paris,

420
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,348
and in my season,

421
00:13:26,348 --> 00:13:27,282
I think,

422
00:13:27,282 --> 00:13:29,051
I was considered as a look queen.

423
00:13:29,184 --> 00:13:30,986
This is my best skill.

424
00:13:30,986 --> 00:13:34,356
The rest of you will be choosing your leaf materials based on the order

425
00:13:34,356 --> 00:13:36,692
of your elimination during the Mini Challenge.

426
00:13:36,692 --> 00:13:37,259
But,

427
00:13:37,693 --> 00:13:38,360
there's a twist.

428
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:39,194
Brigiding!

429
00:13:39,194 --> 00:13:42,097
You will select the color of your fossilized leaves.

430
00:13:42,264 --> 00:13:43,465
You will be the first one.

431
00:13:43,465 --> 00:13:44,800
And then, you have the power

432
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,835
to give another queen a disadvantage.

433
00:13:46,969 --> 00:13:49,271
You'll choose who will pick last.

434
00:13:49,271 --> 00:13:52,374
So, Brigiding, pick your preferred color.

435
00:13:53,809 --> 00:13:56,011
Since I'm wearing the color red,

436
00:13:56,011 --> 00:13:57,179
I'll choose...

437
00:13:57,179 --> 00:13:57,880
Yellow.

438
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,314
No, I’m choosing red!

439
00:13:59,648 --> 00:14:00,382
Red.

440
00:14:00,382 --> 00:14:01,450
So, Brigiding,

441
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:03,518
among these cows,

442
00:14:03,652 --> 00:14:07,055
who do you choose to be the last to pick their cacao leaves?

443
00:14:07,189 --> 00:14:09,825
I think I will be choosing someone,

444
00:14:09,825 --> 00:14:12,427
who is believed to be one the most successful.

445
00:14:12,594 --> 00:14:14,296
- So I'm giving...
- Who is it?

446
00:14:14,296 --> 00:14:15,564
the last pick to...

447
00:14:18,934 --> 00:14:19,902
Suki Doll.

448
00:14:20,535 --> 00:14:23,705
- Where is she? Where is she?
- Yeah, girl.

449
00:14:23,906 --> 00:14:26,208
My sister, Brigiding, is choosing me

450
00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:28,543
to have a disadvantage in a Design Challenge?

451
00:14:28,543 --> 00:14:30,178
We'll see how much that gives her.

452
00:14:30,379 --> 00:14:31,613
Alright, remaining queens,

453
00:14:31,613 --> 00:14:34,616
it's time to pick your desired color for your materials.

454
00:14:34,616 --> 00:14:36,318
Let's start with, Kitty Space.

455
00:14:36,551 --> 00:14:37,619
Color...

456
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,121
Khianna.

457
00:14:39,121 --> 00:14:40,322
I'll get the yellow.

458
00:14:40,989 --> 00:14:42,090
Arizona Brandy.

459
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:43,425
I guess I'll choose this.

460
00:14:43,425 --> 00:14:44,226
Oh, really?

461
00:14:44,226 --> 00:14:44,793
Diday.

462
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:46,128
I want pink.

463
00:14:47,562 --> 00:14:48,597
Go, Viñas DeLuxe.

464
00:14:48,597 --> 00:14:50,032
I'm gonna go with white.

465
00:14:50,933 --> 00:14:51,800
Ivory Glaze.

466
00:14:53,035 --> 00:14:53,936
Siam Phusri.

467
00:14:55,637 --> 00:14:56,204
Yuhua.

468
00:14:56,204 --> 00:14:57,306
Oh, you only have two.

469
00:14:57,506 --> 00:14:59,207
I know, thanks to you.

470
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:03,278
Oh, lastly, Suki Doll.

471
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:07,249
Well, it was actually my choice.

472
00:15:07,416 --> 00:15:08,483
- Oh.
- Thank you.

473
00:15:08,483 --> 00:15:09,651
You got your choice really?

474
00:15:09,651 --> 00:15:12,287
I hope you do that very well without my help.

475
00:15:16,058 --> 00:15:18,427
I didn't get to choose any of the colors,

476
00:15:18,427 --> 00:15:20,796
but the color teal comes to me.

477
00:15:20,796 --> 00:15:24,132
Teal was the color I got also in my season,

478
00:15:24,132 --> 00:15:25,600
that I chose, actually,

479
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,036
to represent a past friend of mine.

480
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:30,339
So Queens, I want couture!

481
00:15:30,339 --> 00:15:32,240
I want elevated fashion.

482
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,377
I want to be gagged, so better start working.

483
00:15:35,377 --> 00:15:36,945
Slaysians, go!

484
00:15:36,945 --> 00:15:39,181
- Yes!
- Yes!

485
00:15:39,481 --> 00:15:41,650
Our challenge is Holy Cacao.

486
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:42,351
Oh, my God.

487
00:15:42,351 --> 00:15:45,554
Just like in our season, we've got leaves!

488
00:15:45,654 --> 00:15:47,122
Thank you, Auro!

489
00:15:48,357 --> 00:15:50,292
Okay, so, what I wanna do,

490
00:15:51,259 --> 00:15:52,494
for this challenge,

491
00:15:52,861 --> 00:15:54,262
is to not be

492
00:15:54,429 --> 00:15:55,297
in the bottom.

493
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:56,798
Back in my season,

494
00:15:57,432 --> 00:15:59,167
I've done a really

495
00:15:59,167 --> 00:16:00,569
really good job.

496
00:16:00,569 --> 00:16:02,637
That was one of the best outfits

497
00:16:02,637 --> 00:16:05,107
that ever walked on the Main Stage.

498
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:07,909
You look like...

499
00:16:07,909 --> 00:16:09,077
...a Christmas decoration

500
00:16:09,077 --> 00:16:11,546
but that’s not the category assigned to you, right?

501
00:16:11,613 --> 00:16:13,482
Are you going to redeem yourself in this challenge,

502
00:16:13,482 --> 00:16:14,649
or will you be in the bottom again?

503
00:16:14,649 --> 00:16:15,650
Bottom, again.

504
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:16,284
Just kidding!

505
00:16:16,351 --> 00:16:18,854
I want to redeem myself in this challenge, sis.

506
00:16:18,854 --> 00:16:19,755
I've already said that

507
00:16:19,755 --> 00:16:23,392
this all-star season will be my moment of redemption

508
00:16:23,392 --> 00:16:25,193
for my looks.

509
00:16:25,193 --> 00:16:27,429
I feel really good, because,

510
00:16:27,429 --> 00:16:29,231
I've studied how to sew.

511
00:16:29,231 --> 00:16:32,534
However, we can't sew those leaves, like...

512
00:16:32,534 --> 00:16:33,835
I need fabric!

513
00:16:34,269 --> 00:16:35,771
Wouldn't that be the biggest plot twist,

514
00:16:35,771 --> 00:16:38,073
if I win this or be on Top for this challenge?

515
00:16:38,073 --> 00:16:40,042
You know what I mean? What a plot twist.

516
00:16:46,448 --> 00:16:47,682
Ah, Suki, girl.

517
00:16:47,983 --> 00:16:48,750
Yes?

518
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:51,753
How do you feel about the disadvantage that you got?

519
00:16:51,753 --> 00:16:54,656
See, in design, there is no such thing as disadvantage.

520
00:16:54,656 --> 00:16:57,692
You just have to roll with what you have, and drag teaches you that.

521
00:16:57,692 --> 00:16:59,661
Suki is a fashion designer

522
00:16:59,661 --> 00:17:01,596
that makes incredible clothing for

523
00:17:01,596 --> 00:17:02,764
other drag queens,

524
00:17:03,031 --> 00:17:03,965
all around the world.

525
00:17:03,965 --> 00:17:06,201
So, I mean, if I was gonna put someone at a disadvantage,

526
00:17:06,201 --> 00:17:07,302
I would pick Suki, too.

527
00:17:07,302 --> 00:17:08,403
So, obviously,

528
00:17:08,403 --> 00:17:09,771
choosing your color last,

529
00:17:09,771 --> 00:17:11,106
or not choosing a color,

530
00:17:11,106 --> 00:17:11,973
could be,

531
00:17:11,973 --> 00:17:14,776
if you don't have the capacity to design properly.

532
00:17:14,776 --> 00:17:15,610
But what are we?

533
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:16,945
- Professionals.
- Exactly.

534
00:17:16,945 --> 00:17:18,914
And I feel like, having a constraint,

535
00:17:18,914 --> 00:17:20,382
is a good way of...

536
00:17:20,382 --> 00:17:21,783
- Being creative.
- Yes.

537
00:17:21,783 --> 00:17:23,552
The thing is, I know how to sew.

538
00:17:23,552 --> 00:17:25,087
And I know how to design.

539
00:17:25,087 --> 00:17:27,456
I just don't like doing it really, really quickly.

540
00:17:30,092 --> 00:17:32,894
I didn’t realize how beautiful these cacao leaves were!

541
00:17:32,894 --> 00:17:34,096
I didn't expect that

542
00:17:34,096 --> 00:17:36,498
such art could come from these leaves.

543
00:17:36,498 --> 00:17:39,534
So I'm excited for this Design Challenge.

544
00:17:39,568 --> 00:17:41,236
- Can you imagine?
- I know.

545
00:17:41,236 --> 00:17:44,072
I won in the first Design Challenge, and then now...

546
00:17:44,439 --> 00:17:46,208
I want to win, because,

547
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:49,678
I want to prove that I wasn't just lucky during my season

548
00:17:49,678 --> 00:17:51,012
when I won the design challenge.

549
00:17:51,012 --> 00:17:54,216
So, may we be guided by the Holy Cacao.

550
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:56,685
You installed quick.

551
00:17:56,685 --> 00:17:58,787
So, do you have anything in mind already?

552
00:17:58,787 --> 00:18:00,188
You're a fashion designer, right?

553
00:18:00,722 --> 00:18:04,059
In my school, during my studies for my graduation collection,

554
00:18:04,059 --> 00:18:05,794
I used unconventional material.

555
00:18:05,794 --> 00:18:07,395
It was like plastic straws,

556
00:18:07,395 --> 00:18:10,031
and I burned it to make fake corals.

557
00:18:10,031 --> 00:18:13,568
To denunciate the pollution in the oceans.

558
00:18:13,835 --> 00:18:16,204
In this challenge, I want to make France shine.

559
00:18:16,204 --> 00:18:18,840
I want to serve an amazing look,

560
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:21,843
inspired by really famous French designers like,

561
00:18:21,877 --> 00:18:23,979
Jean-Paul Gaultier or Thierry Mugler.

562
00:18:23,979 --> 00:18:25,213
I can't fail this.

563
00:18:26,114 --> 00:18:29,017
- Haller haller haller, Queens!
- Hi!

564
00:18:29,017 --> 00:18:30,385
Your time is up!

565
00:18:30,919 --> 00:18:31,753
I'm just kidding!

566
00:18:31,753 --> 00:18:33,555
Girl, we've barely even started.

567
00:18:33,922 --> 00:18:36,691
How are my favorite fashion designers?

568
00:18:36,691 --> 00:18:37,893
- Good.
- Not good.

569
00:18:37,893 --> 00:18:38,894
Yuhua,

570
00:18:38,894 --> 00:18:39,661
Suki,

571
00:18:39,661 --> 00:18:41,696
Viñas, and Khianna.

572
00:18:41,897 --> 00:18:44,132
- I'm planing to create,
- Oh, no. You showed it.

573
00:18:44,132 --> 00:18:46,535
- a look with a face.
- Oh you're planning to

574
00:18:46,535 --> 00:18:47,702
create a scribble.

575
00:18:47,836 --> 00:18:49,504
I don't just want to make a dress,

576
00:18:49,638 --> 00:18:51,173
I want to create art.

577
00:18:51,173 --> 00:18:54,910
So, I want to make a sculpture!

578
00:18:55,610 --> 00:18:56,444
We'll see.

579
00:18:56,444 --> 00:18:58,780
This is very flat, so,

580
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:01,416
it should hug the curves, you know?

581
00:19:01,716 --> 00:19:03,785
I'm gonna put it on a curve, maybe in the middle.

582
00:19:04,252 --> 00:19:04,986
Good luck.

583
00:19:04,986 --> 00:19:06,788
- Thank you.
- I think that's a wonderful idea.

584
00:19:06,788 --> 00:19:07,489
Got it.

585
00:19:07,489 --> 00:19:08,990
Thank you, Mama Pao.

586
00:19:09,157 --> 00:19:10,825
Khianna, you almost won,

587
00:19:10,825 --> 00:19:12,794
- the Design Challenge last season. Almost.
- Yeah.

588
00:19:12,794 --> 00:19:13,762
I almost did.

589
00:19:13,762 --> 00:19:15,797
Last year we had a lot of things

590
00:19:15,797 --> 00:19:16,898
to get, like,

591
00:19:16,898 --> 00:19:19,534
we could make the outfit puffier with plastics,

592
00:19:19,534 --> 00:19:21,703
and use cardboard boxes for structuring it.

593
00:19:21,703 --> 00:19:23,705
And I don't have any of those, so...

594
00:19:23,705 --> 00:19:24,573
But you have this.

595
00:19:25,307 --> 00:19:26,508
Yeah, a little bit.

596
00:19:26,508 --> 00:19:27,442
This is the only part that works.

597
00:19:28,009 --> 00:19:29,344
Suki, were you surprised that

598
00:19:29,344 --> 00:19:31,046
Brigiding gave you a disadvantage?

599
00:19:31,213 --> 00:19:32,113
Shocked!

600
00:19:33,148 --> 00:19:34,182
No, I was not shocked.

601
00:19:34,182 --> 00:19:35,450
I mean, it's only fair.

602
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:37,118
But, I mean, a color disadvantage,

603
00:19:37,118 --> 00:19:39,654
was not a disadvantage, so, I don't mind.

604
00:19:39,654 --> 00:19:40,088
Yeah.

605
00:19:40,088 --> 00:19:43,491
As a mentor for the Design Challenge in Canada's Drag Race...

606
00:19:43,491 --> 00:19:44,192
That's not me.

607
00:19:44,192 --> 00:19:45,727
do you feel any pressure?

608
00:19:46,194 --> 00:19:47,529
Pressure for myself, for sure.

609
00:19:47,529 --> 00:19:49,197
For this concept of mine,

610
00:19:49,197 --> 00:19:52,167
I want to be sure to thank Mother Nature,

611
00:19:52,167 --> 00:19:53,068
and obviously,

612
00:19:53,068 --> 00:19:56,471
all the bountiful resources that's given to the local farmers.

613
00:19:56,471 --> 00:19:58,373
And the natural fibers of the cacao.

614
00:19:58,373 --> 00:20:00,308
So I want to represent Mother Nature,

615
00:20:00,308 --> 00:20:03,478
and represent the goddess, that is Mother Nature.

616
00:20:03,511 --> 00:20:04,879
Next, Yuhua.

617
00:20:04,879 --> 00:20:09,317
My original idea was to do the CEO of Auro Chocolates.

618
00:20:09,451 --> 00:20:10,685
But then, I was thinking, you know,

619
00:20:10,685 --> 00:20:11,886
a top, pants,

620
00:20:11,886 --> 00:20:13,555
a briefcase—that's kinda boring, right?

621
00:20:13,622 --> 00:20:14,889
So, I took a little bit more

622
00:20:14,889 --> 00:20:17,359
advantage of the fact that these are leaves,

623
00:20:17,359 --> 00:20:19,294
so I wanna move in the nature route with it

624
00:20:19,294 --> 00:20:21,763
and take advantage of that because the leaves are already here.

625
00:20:21,763 --> 00:20:23,765
So I'm gonna cut it up a little bit more,

626
00:20:23,765 --> 00:20:24,866
roll it up...

627
00:20:24,866 --> 00:20:26,701
- Don't steal some ideas.
- Manipulate it.

628
00:20:26,701 --> 00:20:29,704
Yeah, manipulate it, give it some more shape, but still see the leaves in it.

629
00:20:29,704 --> 00:20:31,539
But you only have 900.

630
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,775
And I will count every leaf.

631
00:20:33,775 --> 00:20:35,777
And I only need 800 and 99.

632
00:20:35,777 --> 00:20:37,112
Oh, I love it. Give me that last one.

633
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,215
- I'll give it to you as a gift.
- Yes. Yes, yes, yes.

634
00:20:40,248 --> 00:20:41,850
Alright, good luck, queens.

635
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:43,151
- Thank you.
- Relax.

636
00:20:43,151 --> 00:20:44,252
- And enjoy.
- Thank you!

637
00:20:44,252 --> 00:20:45,387
- Thank you.
- Yes, thank you.

638
00:20:45,387 --> 00:20:47,455
- Thank you, Mama Pao. Thank you, for the advice.
- I love your ideas.

639
00:20:47,455 --> 00:20:51,893
Next up, Kitty Space,
Siam Phusri, and Ivory Glaze.

640
00:20:51,893 --> 00:20:53,595
- You said, you're a designer, right?
- Yes.

641
00:20:53,595 --> 00:20:55,430
I'm a designer, that's why I'm so excited.

642
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:56,498
Oh, let's see your design.

643
00:20:56,498 --> 00:20:57,599
My goal is to

644
00:20:57,599 --> 00:21:00,135
show that France is really Paris,

645
00:21:00,135 --> 00:21:02,337
you know, it's really the
capital of fashion and

646
00:21:02,337 --> 00:21:06,341
that it represents France, and that we have amazing fashion designers in Paris.

647
00:21:06,341 --> 00:21:09,244
Isn't this the same with what you already wear...

648
00:21:09,244 --> 00:21:10,278
It's a different idea.

649
00:21:10,278 --> 00:21:12,514
It's just some bustier and stuff...

650
00:21:12,514 --> 00:21:14,115
Ah, yes.

651
00:21:14,115 --> 00:21:15,684
I didn't realize.

652
00:21:15,684 --> 00:21:18,353
I love this kind of silhouette but I already did it.

653
00:21:18,353 --> 00:21:22,557
I'm like, "Oh it's fine, Mama Pao."
I said, "Okay, I can change it."

654
00:21:22,557 --> 00:21:24,559
And now, I started to doubt.

655
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:26,695
I know we're running out of time, but,

656
00:21:26,695 --> 00:21:29,264
I used to work, you know, for fashion jobs.

657
00:21:29,264 --> 00:21:31,499
And sometimes we'd have like, one hour to do it.

658
00:21:31,499 --> 00:21:33,735
Oh, okay, then you can do it.

659
00:21:33,735 --> 00:21:35,303
- I trust you.
- I trust myself now.

660
00:21:35,303 --> 00:21:38,506
Like with what you said to me last week,

661
00:21:38,506 --> 00:21:40,308
- that I need to be "more", you know?
- Yeah.

662
00:21:40,508 --> 00:21:43,311
So I want to show you, that I want to make you proud.

663
00:21:43,311 --> 00:21:44,846
- Alright.
- And make me proud, also.

664
00:21:45,213 --> 00:21:47,248
When I arrive in this Runway,

665
00:21:47,248 --> 00:21:49,017
I want the judges to say,

666
00:21:49,017 --> 00:21:50,752
"Wow!"

667
00:21:51,252 --> 00:21:52,654
I wanna gag them.

668
00:21:52,654 --> 00:21:53,788
And that's what's important.

669
00:21:53,788 --> 00:21:56,057
- Yes.
- And what's important is that Siam is still sketching.

670
00:21:56,057 --> 00:21:58,493
On my Mini Challenge, I used a used big-boob-plate,

671
00:21:58,493 --> 00:22:00,528
- Oh, really?
- but, I've never had

672
00:22:00,528 --> 00:22:02,964
the chance to find a Runway for her yet.

673
00:22:02,997 --> 00:22:05,633
- Oh, so you want her on.
- I call her Phusri, because,

674
00:22:05,633 --> 00:22:07,569
she's like another version of Siam.

675
00:22:07,669 --> 00:22:08,536
Alright, good luck with that.

676
00:22:08,536 --> 00:22:10,505
Ivory. I was surprised you picked

677
00:22:10,538 --> 00:22:12,440
black for your color.

678
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:15,377
- Well...
- Well, actually, I wasn't surprised.

679
00:22:15,977 --> 00:22:19,080
Yeah, I've actually worn black a few times on the Runway already.

680
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:20,849
I don't wear that much black.

681
00:22:20,849 --> 00:22:22,984
I do love black, because I like to accent

682
00:22:23,251 --> 00:22:24,753
other things using black.

683
00:22:24,919 --> 00:22:27,322
So, in that sense, I understand where she's coming from.

684
00:22:27,322 --> 00:22:28,957
So my design...I'm not a drawer...

685
00:22:29,124 --> 00:22:31,059
- It's okay.
- Okay, well, here you go.

686
00:22:31,059 --> 00:22:32,594
It's avant-garde.

687
00:22:32,594 --> 00:22:34,062
This is gonna sell for a lot, one day.

688
00:22:34,195 --> 00:22:36,898
And then what I'm going to do is, I'm going to

689
00:22:37,165 --> 00:22:40,835
coat these with a bit of gold glitter just to help the black pop a bit more.

690
00:22:41,102 --> 00:22:46,107
- I don't like it when it just looks like a swimsuit.
- No, it's not a swimsuit anymore.

691
00:22:46,107 --> 00:22:47,876
It's just because I had only a

692
00:22:47,876 --> 00:22:49,377
- stretch bodysuit.
- Alright.

693
00:22:49,477 --> 00:22:51,780
- Just make a dress, or something.
- It will be a gown.

694
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:52,981
- Gown, yeah.
- It will be a gown.

695
00:22:52,981 --> 00:22:53,748
Gag us.

696
00:22:53,748 --> 00:22:54,516
I will.

697
00:22:54,549 --> 00:22:55,383
Good luck, Queens.

698
00:22:55,383 --> 00:22:57,452
- Thank you, very much.
- Thank you, Mama Pao.

699
00:22:57,552 --> 00:22:59,687
Arizona, Bernie, and Brigiding.

700
00:22:59,921 --> 00:23:01,322
So what's your design?

701
00:23:01,423 --> 00:23:04,092
For me, I am going to try to show

702
00:23:04,092 --> 00:23:06,394
- some legs.
- Show off?

703
00:23:06,394 --> 00:23:08,363
Show off... and show off some legs.

704
00:23:08,563 --> 00:23:10,398
What about you, Arizona?

705
00:23:10,398 --> 00:23:12,167
I would like to honor...

706
00:23:12,167 --> 00:23:14,269
- So there's a graduation, huh?
- Yes.

707
00:23:14,269 --> 00:23:16,538
The salutatorians are the farmers.

708
00:23:18,339 --> 00:23:20,809
I want to respect the leaves they made...

709
00:23:20,842 --> 00:23:22,710
- but I cut them, right?
- I know, right?

710
00:23:22,977 --> 00:23:25,079
No, I want them to see this and

711
00:23:25,079 --> 00:23:27,415
be so moved by it that they cry.

712
00:23:28,349 --> 00:23:30,151
"Why did you cut them?"

713
00:23:30,285 --> 00:23:31,953
They're gonna cry 'cause you cut them.

714
00:23:33,688 --> 00:23:35,590
So my theme for this is

715
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:37,358
like a feathery vibe.

716
00:23:37,358 --> 00:23:38,893
So I was in the bottom

717
00:23:38,893 --> 00:23:40,995
for this challenge, back in my season.

718
00:23:41,129 --> 00:23:43,064
I really wanna do well.

719
00:23:43,264 --> 00:23:45,834
I want to redeem myself, this time.

720
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,836
I want to show everyone

721
00:23:47,836 --> 00:23:51,639
and myself, as well, that I can be a look queen.

722
00:23:53,708 --> 00:23:55,543
So do these look like feathers?

723
00:23:55,577 --> 00:23:57,178
Yes, it looks so much like a feather.

724
00:23:57,178 --> 00:23:59,347
Feathers from a cockfight.

725
00:23:59,948 --> 00:24:01,483
Just snip the edges, don’t cut all the way.

726
00:24:01,483 --> 00:24:02,884
- Just snip the edges, not all the way.
- Ah, so not the entire thing.

727
00:24:02,884 --> 00:24:03,551
- Or you can-
- Oh, no.

728
00:24:03,551 --> 00:24:05,320
- I've cut 400 of them like that.

729
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,287
- Well, shit.

730
00:24:07,755 --> 00:24:08,923
That's half of it.

731
00:24:09,357 --> 00:24:12,460
- Bernie.
- Well, I got pink leaves.

732
00:24:12,827 --> 00:24:15,330
I placed some wire on the leaves.

733
00:24:15,897 --> 00:24:16,865
So...

734
00:24:17,131 --> 00:24:18,933
This one, I'll place here.

735
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,070
Then I'll probably accessorize with a shell in the middle.

736
00:24:23,004 --> 00:24:23,972
Okay. Alright.

737
00:24:23,972 --> 00:24:25,273
Thank you very much, queens.

738
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,674
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Mama Pao.

739
00:24:26,674 --> 00:24:28,376
You may go back to your mothers' wombs.

740
00:24:28,376 --> 00:24:31,679
My Queens, I can't wait to see your looks tomorrow!

741
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:35,517
And on the Main Stage, we'll be joined by our extra special guest judge,

742
00:24:35,617 --> 00:24:37,752
one of the main judges of Drag Race Philippines,

743
00:24:37,752 --> 00:24:39,888
Jervi "KaladKaren" Wrightson.

744
00:24:39,888 --> 00:24:41,222
Yes!

745
00:24:41,222 --> 00:24:43,925
Super eloquent, the comments are beautiful.

746
00:24:43,925 --> 00:24:44,893
Always.

747
00:24:44,893 --> 00:24:47,128
And the host of Drag Race Thailand,

748
00:24:47,128 --> 00:24:48,429
Pangina Heals.

749
00:24:48,429 --> 00:24:50,331
- Wow!
- Yay!

750
00:24:50,331 --> 00:24:52,500
Oh, my goodness.

751
00:24:52,734 --> 00:24:55,770
My mother from Drag Race Thailand.

752
00:24:55,770 --> 00:24:56,404
Okay.

753
00:24:56,437 --> 00:24:59,073
We're gonna get the critique that we are used to getting.

754
00:24:59,073 --> 00:25:00,842
Let's see what it's gonna be!

755
00:25:01,075 --> 00:25:03,044
Queens, it's time to turn a new leaf,

756
00:25:03,044 --> 00:25:04,812
and serve us extravaganza.

757
00:25:04,846 --> 00:25:06,714
#SlaysianRoyale

758
00:25:06,848 --> 00:25:08,850
So racers, start your engines.

759
00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:11,019
And may the best Slaysian queen

760
00:25:11,019 --> 00:25:12,387
- win!
- Win!

761
00:25:13,221 --> 00:25:13,755
Bye!

762
00:25:13,755 --> 00:25:16,791
- Bye, Mama Pao!
- Bye!

763
00:25:16,858 --> 00:25:17,759
It's pressuring.

764
00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:19,694
There's gonna be pressure!

765
00:25:20,728 --> 00:25:21,930
I was like “Okay.”

766
00:25:22,063 --> 00:25:22,931
“What should I do?”

767
00:25:22,931 --> 00:25:25,033
So I started to redraw something really well.

768
00:25:25,333 --> 00:25:26,200
I love you, Jean-Paul, but,

769
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,169
no more Jean-Paul Gaultier, no more cone boobs.

770
00:25:28,236 --> 00:25:29,504
Let's do the other option,

771
00:25:29,504 --> 00:25:30,705
the Mugler inspiration.

772
00:25:31,072 --> 00:25:32,840
So I changed the entire silhouette.

773
00:25:37,545 --> 00:25:38,613
- Get to it, henny.
- Let's go.

774
00:25:39,147 --> 00:25:40,515
Oh, my God, this is it!

775
00:25:40,515 --> 00:25:41,783
It's a new day in the Werkroom.

776
00:25:41,783 --> 00:25:44,586
And so many bitches are stressed out,

777
00:25:44,586 --> 00:25:45,720
except for me. Kidding!

778
00:25:47,088 --> 00:25:49,023
Who do you think

779
00:25:49,023 --> 00:25:50,358
WE will be up against at the Top?

780
00:25:51,392 --> 00:25:53,061
I get nervous when you say shit like that, sis.

781
00:25:53,061 --> 00:25:55,530
Sometimes when I expect an outcome, that’s when things don't go as planned.

782
00:25:55,530 --> 00:25:58,366
But I think Kitty's is fire. Look.

783
00:25:58,366 --> 00:26:00,435
Viñas DeLuxe is a visual artist.

784
00:26:00,602 --> 00:26:01,336
The challenge just started,

785
00:26:01,336 --> 00:26:03,504
and I see she's already explored so much.

786
00:26:03,504 --> 00:26:05,073
She's already made a sculpture,

787
00:26:05,073 --> 00:26:07,575
she made a face, a flower,

788
00:26:07,575 --> 00:26:08,910
and then she made a skirt.

789
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:11,779
So I know that Vinas DeLuxe's creation will be

790
00:26:11,779 --> 00:26:13,414
the competition in this week.

791
00:26:13,748 --> 00:26:14,983
You know, I can see that

792
00:26:15,617 --> 00:26:17,018
that's your favorite silhouette.

793
00:26:17,118 --> 00:26:19,554
- Yes.
- I mean, whenever we had

794
00:26:19,554 --> 00:26:21,789
a chance to design or whatever,

795
00:26:21,789 --> 00:26:25,560
or draw, ten years ago, from O Bar, do you remember?

796
00:26:25,893 --> 00:26:28,129
That's the silhouette I've always seen from you and

797
00:26:28,129 --> 00:26:29,230
it suits you very well.

798
00:26:29,364 --> 00:26:32,033
I love seeing her

799
00:26:32,033 --> 00:26:34,168
more confident in what she's doing,

800
00:26:34,168 --> 00:26:37,405
and it's beautiful 'cause what she made was very her.

801
00:26:37,405 --> 00:26:39,574
And she delivered.

802
00:26:45,113 --> 00:26:46,914
I can't get this bitch in the hole.

803
00:26:47,582 --> 00:26:49,317
My original concept was

804
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:51,886
to have a bit of like a corset top

805
00:26:51,886 --> 00:26:54,555
with a skirt that was floor-length.

806
00:26:54,722 --> 00:26:56,224
But just with the time.

807
00:26:56,224 --> 00:26:58,693
I had to change it, just so I could at least...

808
00:26:58,693 --> 00:27:01,696
I needed to have something presentable for the Runway, you know?

809
00:27:02,497 --> 00:27:03,297
Ivory.

810
00:27:03,564 --> 00:27:05,400
- Hey!
- How are you doing, girl?

811
00:27:05,633 --> 00:27:07,502
- I'm feeling good. I've got
- Yeah.

812
00:27:07,502 --> 00:27:08,670
most of it done.

813
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:10,471
And then I'll just do the final details

814
00:27:10,471 --> 00:27:11,205
at the end, so...

815
00:27:11,239 --> 00:27:13,007
You're like a perfectionist, aren't you?

816
00:27:13,708 --> 00:27:15,443
I am, like,

817
00:27:15,443 --> 00:27:17,011
I really struggled with it as well,

818
00:27:17,045 --> 00:27:18,680
to like the point it became my detriment.

819
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:21,382
I don't know, I've always been raised in such a way that like

820
00:27:21,649 --> 00:27:22,684
I've always had

821
00:27:22,684 --> 00:27:24,452
like a really high standard put on me.

822
00:27:24,452 --> 00:27:27,188
I don't know. We always want to make our parents proud, and stuff...

823
00:27:27,188 --> 00:27:29,090
I guess really, I wasn't really struggling

824
00:27:29,123 --> 00:27:30,692
with achieving what they wanted.

825
00:27:30,692 --> 00:27:32,960
I was good with grades, and I did all the sports,

826
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,362
and picked up music and stuff...

827
00:27:34,562 --> 00:27:36,698
Do you feel like you bring it also in the competition?

828
00:27:36,864 --> 00:27:38,499
I think I have been, a little bit.

829
00:27:38,599 --> 00:27:39,500
- And I think...
- In a good way?

830
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:40,668
Good and bad, you know?

831
00:27:40,702 --> 00:27:42,670
Because, good, you can see all the things that are wrong.

832
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:46,007
Bad, in a way that you, you know it's wrong and then you try to fix everything,

833
00:27:46,007 --> 00:27:47,141
and it makes you flustered

834
00:27:47,141 --> 00:27:48,943
because you can't fix everything and make it perfect.

835
00:27:49,143 --> 00:27:52,647
Yeah. I think, honestly, in drag also, what makes us realize

836
00:27:52,647 --> 00:27:54,048
that imperfection's perfect,

837
00:27:54,048 --> 00:27:56,050
is also, that everything we do,

838
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:57,452
has so many steps and processes,

839
00:27:57,452 --> 00:27:59,520
and like there's so many ways to go about it and

840
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,889
to finish it or to have, like, a way of

841
00:28:01,889 --> 00:28:03,558
- you know, achieving the goal.
- Yeah.

842
00:28:03,591 --> 00:28:04,792
That it's not

843
00:28:05,026 --> 00:28:06,561
imperfect, in a way.

844
00:28:08,229 --> 00:28:09,731
It's just stressing me out

845
00:28:09,731 --> 00:28:11,365
at this point in life. Where like,

846
00:28:11,365 --> 00:28:13,067
if I'm not perfect, then, I'm

847
00:28:13,067 --> 00:28:14,702
upset that I'm not perfect.

848
00:28:14,702 --> 00:28:16,504
But if I let myself be "not perfect",

849
00:28:16,504 --> 00:28:18,873
then I'm upset that the thing is not perfect.

850
00:28:19,006 --> 00:28:21,242
And I'm just constantly like, never satisfied,

851
00:28:21,275 --> 00:28:24,212
and never happy, and I could never just enjoy myself.

852
00:28:24,512 --> 00:28:26,180
- I have a question.
- Go.

853
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:28,549
When you were announced on your cast,

854
00:28:28,549 --> 00:28:30,752
for Drag Race Down Under...
- Yeah.

855
00:28:30,752 --> 00:28:32,720
What was like your family's reaction?

856
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,955
Well, I told my mum.

857
00:28:33,955 --> 00:28:34,355
Right.

858
00:28:34,355 --> 00:28:36,758
On the day of the cast announcement, it was kind of like,

859
00:28:36,758 --> 00:28:38,993
the best and the worst day of my life, because,

860
00:28:39,227 --> 00:28:40,261
- Why?
- on one hand,

861
00:28:40,294 --> 00:28:42,196
you get announced for Drag Race, and

862
00:28:42,196 --> 00:28:45,032
you know, you're so happy, and everyone's celebrating you.

863
00:28:45,266 --> 00:28:46,033
On the other hand,

864
00:28:46,033 --> 00:28:49,604
my mum had died just, like, two weeks before the cast announcement.

865
00:28:49,604 --> 00:28:51,806
And she was really excited to watch the season.

866
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,643
And the announcement date was the same day as her funeral that I was running.

867
00:28:55,643 --> 00:28:56,310
Shit.

868
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:58,012
So I was

869
00:28:58,012 --> 00:29:01,182
speaking at my mother's funeral, and running it at the same time

870
00:29:01,182 --> 00:29:02,316
as my phone blowing up.

871
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:03,518
And so,

872
00:29:03,618 --> 00:29:06,654
I never really got to, like, enjoy actually being on Drag Race.

873
00:29:07,054 --> 00:29:09,123
We had a bit of a rocky past, but we

874
00:29:09,123 --> 00:29:12,193
had mended it and she was actually excited to watch the show.

875
00:29:12,193 --> 00:29:14,462
And like, it was only within those last—

876
00:29:15,062 --> 00:29:16,364
between filming and airing,

877
00:29:16,364 --> 00:29:20,034
that we had really gotten that reconcilliation. And so,

878
00:29:20,034 --> 00:29:22,069
I felt almost cheated

879
00:29:22,203 --> 00:29:23,671
by life, because,

880
00:29:23,905 --> 00:29:25,606
that enjoyment was gone.

881
00:29:25,606 --> 00:29:28,176
But I had to keep going because

882
00:29:28,176 --> 00:29:30,178
you know, the show's airing, I still gotta

883
00:29:30,511 --> 00:29:32,213
tour, and like, I can't

884
00:29:32,213 --> 00:29:32,814
hide.

885
00:29:33,314 --> 00:29:35,116
So it was a very confusing

886
00:29:35,249 --> 00:29:36,484
time of my life.

887
00:29:36,851 --> 00:29:38,786
- I'm sorry that happened to you, but,
- It's okay.

888
00:29:39,287 --> 00:29:41,455
- she's looking down, she's
- It's life, you know.

889
00:29:41,455 --> 00:29:43,090
- extremely proud of you.
- Right.

890
00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:45,159
- for being here.
- Yeah, I mean, like, I wear this necklace a lot,

891
00:29:45,159 --> 00:29:46,861
because it's got her hair.

892
00:29:46,894 --> 00:29:48,663
I cut her hair and put it in here.

893
00:29:49,664 --> 00:29:52,700
So whenever I feel stressed, I

894
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,368
- take this with me. Yeah.
- Have her around.

895
00:29:57,338 --> 00:29:58,372
- I’m sorry.
- That's okay.

896
00:29:58,472 --> 00:29:59,841
I felt sad for her,

897
00:29:59,841 --> 00:30:02,310
but I know her mom is smiling at her.

898
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:04,745
I think her mom would be really proud.

899
00:30:04,745 --> 00:30:05,746
So, tough,

900
00:30:05,746 --> 00:30:06,681
but life goes on.

901
00:30:07,915 --> 00:30:11,752
- But I know it sucks, and I'm trying not to do that.
- It sucks.

902
00:30:11,752 --> 00:30:13,788
I don't know. I just wanna do good at one challenge

903
00:30:13,788 --> 00:30:15,189
so I wanna get my make up on.
- Good.

904
00:30:15,189 --> 00:30:16,157
You're doing good.

905
00:30:16,157 --> 00:30:18,759
- Love you.
- And, thank you, I love you, too.

906
00:30:43,751 --> 00:30:44,485
Mabuheeey!

907
00:30:44,485 --> 00:30:46,153
I'm your mothertucking host,

908
00:30:46,153 --> 00:30:47,655
and welcome to the Main Stage of

909
00:30:47,655 --> 00:30:51,292
Drag Race Philippines: Slaysian Royale!

910
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:55,196
The first-ever Trans Best Supporting Actress

911
00:30:55,196 --> 00:30:57,064
and news anchor in the Philippines,

912
00:30:57,064 --> 00:31:00,534
and Drag Race Philippines Resident Evil...

913
00:31:00,868 --> 00:31:04,972
It’s the one woman wonder, Jervi “Kaladkaren” Wrightson!

914
00:31:05,373 --> 00:31:07,308
Hi! May I ask you, Jervi,

915
00:31:07,475 --> 00:31:09,610
is it sex or chocolate?

916
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:10,311
Wait,

917
00:31:10,978 --> 00:31:12,380
I think it's...

918
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:14,315
chocolates!

919
00:31:14,315 --> 00:31:16,050
- With sex.
- Oh.

920
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:18,586
But it's Auro Chocolate!

921
00:31:18,586 --> 00:31:20,021
Got it, Jervi.

922
00:31:20,154 --> 00:31:21,455
She has arrived!

923
00:31:21,455 --> 00:31:22,990
RuGirl from Bangkok,

924
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:24,992
and host of Drag Race Thailand,

925
00:31:25,226 --> 00:31:27,128
Pangina Heals!

926
00:31:27,228 --> 00:31:29,630
- Sawasdee kha.
- Sawasdee kha.

927
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:31,332
Mabuheeey!

928
00:31:31,332 --> 00:31:34,101
Are you gonna be sweeter than chocolate, Pangina?

929
00:31:34,168 --> 00:31:36,771
Well, my favorite chocolate is dark chocolate

930
00:31:36,771 --> 00:31:39,507
so, depending on what I see on the stage today,

931
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,809
you'll see which Pangina you'll get.

932
00:31:42,109 --> 00:31:42,910
Oh!

933
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:45,613
By the way, that just makes my mouth

934
00:31:45,613 --> 00:31:46,847
salivate.

935
00:31:47,214 --> 00:31:49,317
Salivate?!

936
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:54,288
By the way, Jimbo left you a message, Pangina.

937
00:31:54,388 --> 00:31:55,456
What did that bitch say?

938
00:31:55,656 --> 00:31:56,791
She said,

939
00:31:56,791 --> 00:31:58,326
"You deserve it."

940
00:31:59,827 --> 00:32:00,761
Okay!

941
00:32:02,897 --> 00:32:05,366
For this week’s challenge, the queens were tasked

942
00:32:05,366 --> 00:32:09,637
with transforming fossilized cacao leaves into Fashion Eleganza.

943
00:32:10,738 --> 00:32:11,706
Racers,

944
00:32:11,806 --> 00:32:13,140
start your engines.

945
00:32:13,341 --> 00:32:14,508
And may the best

946
00:32:14,508 --> 00:32:17,611
Slaysian queen win!

947
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:22,049
Holy moly! Category is,

948
00:32:22,216 --> 00:32:23,651
“Holy Cacao!”

949
00:32:23,651 --> 00:32:24,585
Starting with

950
00:32:24,585 --> 00:32:26,120
Arizona Brandy.

951
00:32:27,054 --> 00:32:28,422
For this Runway,

952
00:32:28,422 --> 00:32:34,528
I'm wearing this beautiful gown, accented with feathers!

953
00:32:34,528 --> 00:32:36,831
I hope the farmers are really proud,

954
00:32:36,831 --> 00:32:38,866
I hope I respected

955
00:32:38,866 --> 00:32:39,800
the material.

956
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:42,136
I feel really beautiful in this outfit.

957
00:32:42,136 --> 00:32:43,704
I'm so proud of myself

958
00:32:43,704 --> 00:32:46,107
because I was able to pull this off.

959
00:32:46,707 --> 00:32:49,143
In Filipino, it's so orange!

960
00:32:49,377 --> 00:32:50,745
Orangy-slutty!

961
00:32:51,479 --> 00:32:52,546
Ah, I'm beautiful.

962
00:32:53,681 --> 00:32:55,716
Stun-gerine!

963
00:32:57,651 --> 00:32:59,020
Kitty Space.

964
00:33:02,757 --> 00:33:04,725
She blue me away!

965
00:33:04,792 --> 00:33:06,427
way... way...

966
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,195
Fuck it, let's blue up this joint.

967
00:33:09,296 --> 00:33:12,166
This look is inspired by Thierry Mugler.

968
00:33:12,666 --> 00:33:14,969
It's a blue and intergalactic

969
00:33:15,036 --> 00:33:16,337
space look.

970
00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:18,072
It's really me.

971
00:33:18,239 --> 00:33:21,575
This look has a big halo around my head

972
00:33:21,575 --> 00:33:23,244
and big, big hips.

973
00:33:23,377 --> 00:33:25,613
I really feel my Kitty Space fantasy

974
00:33:25,613 --> 00:33:26,981
because I am the kitty

975
00:33:27,114 --> 00:33:28,616
in the middle of the space.

976
00:33:28,883 --> 00:33:29,984
This is fashion.

977
00:33:29,984 --> 00:33:31,886
So, go for it.

978
00:33:32,119 --> 00:33:33,287
Beautiful.

979
00:33:33,621 --> 00:33:34,889
Futuristic

980
00:33:35,122 --> 00:33:36,757
nymph creature.

981
00:33:37,258 --> 00:33:38,859
Khianna.

982
00:33:40,027 --> 00:33:41,862
Yellow, yellow, yellow!

983
00:33:42,296 --> 00:33:43,631
So for this Runway,

984
00:33:43,631 --> 00:33:46,801
I am the ray of sunshine after the rain.

985
00:33:46,901 --> 00:33:50,371
So as you can see, my details on my outfit,

986
00:33:50,371 --> 00:33:53,574
there are some droplets of rain.

987
00:33:54,341 --> 00:33:58,479
And I think that I'm bold and bright today, because

988
00:33:58,479 --> 00:34:00,047
yellow is

989
00:34:00,047 --> 00:34:01,615
saying hello!

990
00:34:02,283 --> 00:34:03,217
Yes!

991
00:34:07,621 --> 00:34:09,857
She's walking on sunshine.

992
00:34:11,826 --> 00:34:13,260
Siam Phusri.

993
00:34:14,428 --> 00:34:16,931
It’s shocked-colate.

994
00:34:18,099 --> 00:34:20,101
Hello, ladies and gentlemen.

995
00:34:20,101 --> 00:34:22,703
Phusri just arrived.

996
00:34:22,703 --> 00:34:23,971
Look at my hair,

997
00:34:23,971 --> 00:34:26,540
look at my boobs, look at my ass.

998
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:29,477
Look at me, sexy everywhere.

999
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:33,647
Now it's time for Phusri to shine!

1000
00:34:33,848 --> 00:34:36,617
Hot cocoa, haute couture!

1001
00:34:38,452 --> 00:34:39,687
What kind of chocolate is that?

1002
00:34:39,687 --> 00:34:41,322
Is that milk chocolate?

1003
00:34:44,091 --> 00:34:44,925
Brigiding.

1004
00:34:45,593 --> 00:34:46,861
Red-y or not,

1005
00:34:46,861 --> 00:34:49,230
here she comes!

1006
00:34:49,497 --> 00:34:55,069
I am coming down the Runway as the Queen of the cacao forests.

1007
00:34:55,236 --> 00:34:58,806
I am blooming, but also bleeding in red.

1008
00:34:59,206 --> 00:35:00,608
Red-y to spread

1009
00:35:01,008 --> 00:35:02,743
bittersweetness,

1010
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:05,045
elegance, and opulence.

1011
00:35:06,914 --> 00:35:08,949
She is a scarlet harlot.

1012
00:35:12,153 --> 00:35:13,387
Ivory Glaze.

1013
00:35:16,257 --> 00:35:17,458
Tonight, on the Runway,

1014
00:35:17,458 --> 00:35:19,293
I am serving you

1015
00:35:19,326 --> 00:35:20,427
my best, girl.

1016
00:35:20,427 --> 00:35:21,128
Doing the best!

1017
00:35:21,128 --> 00:35:23,230
It's dark, it's elven,

1018
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:25,199
but also kinda like a Victoria Secret model.

1019
00:35:25,266 --> 00:35:26,634
I actually felt really good

1020
00:35:26,667 --> 00:35:28,335
walking that Runway for the first time.

1021
00:35:28,335 --> 00:35:29,203
I feel like,

1022
00:35:29,203 --> 00:35:30,938
that was the first time that I actually got to

1023
00:35:30,938 --> 00:35:34,108
strut, and stomp, and actually live

1024
00:35:34,241 --> 00:35:37,411
that proper fantasy that all the girls have always been telling me about.

1025
00:35:37,811 --> 00:35:39,413
Oh, my goth!

1026
00:35:39,813 --> 00:35:41,715
Goth bleth you.

1027
00:35:42,783 --> 00:35:44,318
Viñas DeLuxe.

1028
00:35:47,221 --> 00:35:48,889
Oh, bitch!

1029
00:35:48,889 --> 00:35:50,624
Oh, bitch!

1030
00:35:51,492 --> 00:35:52,393
Oh!

1031
00:35:52,693 --> 00:35:53,994
Fuck you!

1032
00:35:54,562 --> 00:35:55,496
For this look,

1033
00:35:55,496 --> 00:35:58,732
we trusted our intuition.

1034
00:35:58,732 --> 00:36:03,771
I added a sculpture of a face, to show my talent

1035
00:36:03,771 --> 00:36:05,773
with sculpting.

1036
00:36:05,773 --> 00:36:07,775
And of course, I gave it hair,

1037
00:36:07,775 --> 00:36:10,244
to showcase the same technique

1038
00:36:10,277 --> 00:36:12,413
that I use in my hairstyling, so,

1039
00:36:12,413 --> 00:36:14,815
this is my story as a drag queen.

1040
00:36:15,082 --> 00:36:15,683
Bitch!

1041
00:36:19,286 --> 00:36:20,988
- I have no words.
- Yeah.

1042
00:36:21,689 --> 00:36:22,890
Suki Doll.

1043
00:36:23,290 --> 00:36:24,525
I like the teal.

1044
00:36:24,758 --> 00:36:26,894
Teal as old as time.

1045
00:36:27,127 --> 00:36:28,229
For this Runway,

1046
00:36:28,229 --> 00:36:30,097
I am the goddess, Mother Nature.

1047
00:36:30,097 --> 00:36:31,498
The mother of all

1048
00:36:31,498 --> 00:36:33,500
that gives you the plentiful fruit

1049
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:35,202
of the cacao.

1050
00:36:35,402 --> 00:36:36,503
What's the tea-l?

1051
00:36:36,737 --> 00:36:38,038
Something real.

1052
00:36:39,373 --> 00:36:41,008
These leaves are represented

1053
00:36:41,008 --> 00:36:43,544
with the transparency, the beauty of the fibers.

1054
00:36:43,711 --> 00:36:46,046
And obviously, I'm doing this asymmetrical look,

1055
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:47,681
with the gold flaking through

1056
00:36:47,681 --> 00:36:48,716
the top to the bottom,

1057
00:36:48,716 --> 00:36:51,485
having a crown that goes around the neck,

1058
00:36:51,485 --> 00:36:54,688
and the beauty of the leg, and the body of Mother Nature.

1059
00:36:57,925 --> 00:36:58,525
Bernie.

1060
00:36:59,026 --> 00:37:00,527
Oh, Barbie-cute.

1061
00:37:00,561 --> 00:37:02,162
No, Bar-coochie.

1062
00:37:03,597 --> 00:37:07,034
My inspiration for this Runway, is like a flower.

1063
00:37:07,034 --> 00:37:09,036
A flower in full bloom,

1064
00:37:09,036 --> 00:37:10,170
for everyone to marvel at.

1065
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:12,273
You won't be able to tell they're leaves

1066
00:37:12,273 --> 00:37:14,341
because at the top part, it looks fresh.

1067
00:37:14,341 --> 00:37:17,244
But on the bottom half, well, not so much!

1068
00:37:18,746 --> 00:37:21,282
We can see the cock-ao from here.

1069
00:37:22,316 --> 00:37:24,451
She's the Queen of Cock-ao.

1070
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:27,454
Yuhua.

1071
00:37:28,389 --> 00:37:30,190
She's so ultra-

1072
00:37:30,524 --> 00:37:31,358
violet!

1073
00:37:31,425 --> 00:37:34,728
As I'm walking down this Runway, I'm feeling, what?

1074
00:37:35,195 --> 00:37:36,297
Gorgeous!

1075
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:37,898
I am feeling purple,

1076
00:37:37,898 --> 00:37:39,933
I'm feeling a bit of punk rock,

1077
00:37:39,933 --> 00:37:41,602
mixing with the whole element.

1078
00:37:41,602 --> 00:37:43,304
Nobody else is really doing it.

1079
00:37:43,304 --> 00:37:44,805
I have my sunglasses on,

1080
00:37:44,838 --> 00:37:46,774
my punk rock hair, but yeah.

1081
00:37:46,774 --> 00:37:48,042
I feel good.

1082
00:37:48,776 --> 00:37:50,444
Any violet reactions?

1083
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:55,416
- Violet reaction.
- Okay, okay, okay.

1084
00:37:57,484 --> 00:37:59,219
Welcome back, ladies.

1085
00:37:59,219 --> 00:38:01,889
When I call your name, please step forward.

1086
00:38:06,093 --> 00:38:07,594
Khianna.

1087
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:10,097
Brigiding.

1088
00:38:11,432 --> 00:38:12,433
Bernie.

1089
00:38:13,834 --> 00:38:15,169
And Yuhua.

1090
00:38:17,237 --> 00:38:17,971
Queens,

1091
00:38:17,971 --> 00:38:19,440
you are safe.

1092
00:38:20,541 --> 00:38:22,843
Please, go untuck in the Werkroom.

1093
00:38:23,344 --> 00:38:24,812
Thank you, Mama Pao.

1094
00:38:30,918 --> 00:38:32,820
The rest of you represent the Tops

1095
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:34,221
and Bottoms of the week.

1096
00:38:34,888 --> 00:38:38,158
Now, it's time for the judges' critiques.

1097
00:38:38,158 --> 00:38:40,394
First up, Arizona Brandy.

1098
00:38:40,928 --> 00:38:42,096
Arizona!

1099
00:38:42,896 --> 00:38:44,631
I like the orange on you.

1100
00:38:44,832 --> 00:38:46,700
- Thank you.
- But I'm so sorry,

1101
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:49,269
but I have to say that this look is

1102
00:38:49,269 --> 00:38:50,804
underwhelming.

1103
00:38:51,305 --> 00:38:54,041
How I wish, you used more leaves

1104
00:38:54,041 --> 00:38:55,242
in your outfit.

1105
00:38:55,242 --> 00:38:57,277
I felt your confidence on stage.

1106
00:38:57,277 --> 00:39:00,614
You were able to actually sell us your outfit.

1107
00:39:00,647 --> 00:39:05,119
However, I just felt like, the outfit could have been

1108
00:39:05,452 --> 00:39:06,487
improved.

1109
00:39:07,154 --> 00:39:08,789
Also, your fabric choice, I think,
- Right.

1110
00:39:08,789 --> 00:39:10,290
was the wrong fabric choice.

1111
00:39:10,290 --> 00:39:14,228
It didn't really compliment the treatment of the leaves.

1112
00:39:14,228 --> 00:39:16,663
However, I think you really did a good job with

1113
00:39:16,663 --> 00:39:17,931
what you started with.

1114
00:39:17,931 --> 00:39:19,366
It just could have gone more.

1115
00:39:19,366 --> 00:39:20,834
Can you turn around, as well?

1116
00:39:21,869 --> 00:39:23,337
It seems messy in the back.

1117
00:39:23,804 --> 00:39:25,005
It seems messy in the back.

1118
00:39:25,005 --> 00:39:26,673
And that’s what I noticed as well.

1119
00:39:26,673 --> 00:39:27,775
But good job.

1120
00:39:27,941 --> 00:39:29,576
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1121
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:31,478
Oh, Arizona.

1122
00:39:32,012 --> 00:39:33,414
Where's the leaf?

1123
00:39:34,515 --> 00:39:35,449
It's here, Mama Pao.

1124
00:39:35,449 --> 00:39:35,849
But

1125
00:39:35,849 --> 00:39:39,787
this is much better than your Design Challenge in your season.

1126
00:39:39,787 --> 00:39:41,054
Thank you, Arizona.

1127
00:39:41,054 --> 00:39:42,389
Thank you.

1128
00:39:42,656 --> 00:39:43,857
Kitty Space.

1129
00:39:43,857 --> 00:39:45,826
- Hi, everyone!
- Hi.

1130
00:39:45,826 --> 00:39:47,694
I think you look like

1131
00:39:47,694 --> 00:39:50,998
a wonderful intergalactic nymph creature.

1132
00:39:50,998 --> 00:39:51,598
Oh!

1133
00:39:51,598 --> 00:39:52,800
- When you-
- That was

1134
00:39:52,833 --> 00:39:53,967
- What?
- the inspiration.

1135
00:39:53,967 --> 00:39:55,402
Kitty. Space.

1136
00:39:55,402 --> 00:39:56,170
- Yes.
- Yes.

1137
00:39:56,170 --> 00:39:56,937
Yes.

1138
00:39:56,937 --> 00:39:59,940
And I think the way, when you walked down the Runway,

1139
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:02,876
you utilized the translucent quality of the leaves,

1140
00:40:02,876 --> 00:40:05,612
and it really excited me to see someone who

1141
00:40:05,612 --> 00:40:08,148
considers aesthetic from head to toe.

1142
00:40:08,315 --> 00:40:09,049
So, well done.

1143
00:40:09,316 --> 00:40:11,752
You are absolutely

1144
00:40:11,752 --> 00:40:13,487
- gorgeous!
- Thank you.

1145
00:40:13,487 --> 00:40:15,189
I love that outfit.

1146
00:40:15,589 --> 00:40:17,925
It's polished from head to toe.

1147
00:40:18,025 --> 00:40:22,963
I like how you made that headdress seamlessly connect

1148
00:40:22,963 --> 00:40:24,798
- to your whole outfit.
- It is.

1149
00:40:24,798 --> 00:40:25,866
It's so I can't move.

1150
00:40:25,866 --> 00:40:27,534
And with your hair...

1151
00:40:27,568 --> 00:40:28,368
Yeah.

1152
00:40:28,368 --> 00:40:31,171
- Everything is fabulous.
- Thank you.

1153
00:40:31,171 --> 00:40:33,474
You have really improved, Kitty Space.

1154
00:40:33,474 --> 00:40:34,942
Your fart is bleu.

1155
00:40:34,942 --> 00:40:37,311
Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir?

1156
00:40:37,311 --> 00:40:38,278
I love it.

1157
00:40:38,278 --> 00:40:39,613
Siam Phusri.

1158
00:40:39,646 --> 00:40:41,315
Hi, Siam!

1159
00:40:41,315 --> 00:40:43,851
Mabuhay.

1160
00:40:43,917 --> 00:40:47,921
I like that you are always thinking out of the box,

1161
00:40:47,921 --> 00:40:49,323
in terms of your look.

1162
00:40:49,456 --> 00:40:50,757
However,

1163
00:40:50,924 --> 00:40:53,227
Where is the ass?

1164
00:40:53,594 --> 00:40:57,397
If you're showing your hips, and your bum,

1165
00:40:57,397 --> 00:41:00,000
I would like to see some pads in there, honey.

1166
00:41:00,601 --> 00:41:01,368
I think

1167
00:41:01,368 --> 00:41:04,471
your look is more polished than what I've seen

1168
00:41:04,471 --> 00:41:06,406
when you were on Drag Race Thailand.

1169
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,242
Having said that,

1170
00:41:09,343 --> 00:41:12,379
your breast plate is a different color to your face

1171
00:41:12,379 --> 00:41:13,780
and your body, number one.

1172
00:41:13,847 --> 00:41:16,316
Number two, your g-string is so loose,

1173
00:41:16,316 --> 00:41:19,253
it ends up looking more like a diaper than a g-string.

1174
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:21,755
You need to consider

1175
00:41:21,788 --> 00:41:23,223
the polished quality.

1176
00:41:23,223 --> 00:41:26,727
You're on a show that is seen all around the world.

1177
00:41:26,727 --> 00:41:28,529
I am not gonna sit here and be like,

1178
00:41:28,529 --> 00:41:29,496
"Oh, it's amazing!"

1179
00:41:29,496 --> 00:41:32,666
when I can clock details that needs to be fixed.

1180
00:41:33,133 --> 00:41:34,468
I think your make up looks great.

1181
00:41:34,835 --> 00:41:36,270
So I'm not saying that everything is bad.

1182
00:41:36,270 --> 00:41:38,672
I'm just saying, there's certain things that you need to consider,

1183
00:41:38,672 --> 00:41:41,909
while you're walking on this prestigious stage.

1184
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:44,645
Next, Ivory Glaze.

1185
00:41:44,745 --> 00:41:45,712
Hello!

1186
00:41:46,046 --> 00:41:48,415
I love the legs.

1187
00:41:48,582 --> 00:41:51,752
You know how to accentuate your assets.

1188
00:41:51,752 --> 00:41:53,554
However, I felt like,

1189
00:41:53,554 --> 00:41:55,556
this look is a little bit unfinished.

1190
00:41:55,956 --> 00:41:59,259
For me, you could have added more leaves at the back.

1191
00:41:59,793 --> 00:42:01,762
I felt like, it's quite too short.

1192
00:42:02,229 --> 00:42:07,401
I just felt like you could have improved more in terms of the structure

1193
00:42:07,668 --> 00:42:08,835
of the outfit,

1194
00:42:08,835 --> 00:42:12,940
and the use of leaves in some parts of the look.

1195
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:17,044
To be honest, I think this outfit leaves me quite underwhelmed.

1196
00:42:17,044 --> 00:42:19,146
And there are some editing choices with

1197
00:42:19,146 --> 00:42:20,647
jewelry as well.

1198
00:42:20,647 --> 00:42:22,149
I mean if you're going with gold,

1199
00:42:22,849 --> 00:42:24,885
in your décolletage area...

1200
00:42:24,885 --> 00:42:27,421
You're actually wearing something that’s diamonds,

1201
00:42:27,421 --> 00:42:29,623
and it pulls me a little bit out of the fantasy of

1202
00:42:29,623 --> 00:42:31,224
making everything seamless.

1203
00:42:31,224 --> 00:42:33,827
I feel like the construction is not doing your body justice.

1204
00:42:33,827 --> 00:42:35,128
I mean, you just have,

1205
00:42:35,128 --> 00:42:37,564
one of the most amazing legs I've ever seen in my life, so,

1206
00:42:37,564 --> 00:42:39,066
I do wish that

1207
00:42:39,066 --> 00:42:41,702
your construction would have flattered your

1208
00:42:42,002 --> 00:42:43,036
body more.

1209
00:42:44,605 --> 00:42:45,105
Thank you.

1210
00:42:45,138 --> 00:42:47,207
Ivory Glaze, how are you feeling?

1211
00:42:47,574 --> 00:42:49,576
My mum passed away

1212
00:42:49,977 --> 00:42:52,479
just before my last Drag Race experience.

1213
00:42:52,613 --> 00:42:53,513
Oh.

1214
00:42:55,515 --> 00:42:55,916
I know.

1215
00:42:55,916 --> 00:42:58,952
I believe a bit in ancestors, who are always watching over me.

1216
00:42:59,219 --> 00:43:01,588
Not enough to tell me to make my skirt longer.

1217
00:43:01,822 --> 00:43:05,459
But long enough, I believe that she's watching over me.

1218
00:43:05,459 --> 00:43:06,493
Well... you said

1219
00:43:06,493 --> 00:43:08,595
she's watching you right now, that she's always watching you.

1220
00:43:08,595 --> 00:43:09,763
What do you want to say to her?

1221
00:43:11,798 --> 00:43:12,766
Sorry.

1222
00:43:15,502 --> 00:43:16,336
I don't...

1223
00:43:16,403 --> 00:43:18,238
I want to apologize.

1224
00:43:18,238 --> 00:43:19,673
Why?

1225
00:43:20,273 --> 00:43:21,675
Why do you want to apologize?

1226
00:43:23,377 --> 00:43:24,511
Yeah, it’s tough,

1227
00:43:24,811 --> 00:43:26,980
I’m sad, I feel like I’ve disappointed

1228
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:30,350
my mother and myself mostly.

1229
00:43:31,785 --> 00:43:33,153
This is so frustrating.

1230
00:43:34,921 --> 00:43:35,455
Sorry.

1231
00:43:35,455 --> 00:43:38,792
Baby, you have to understand something.

1232
00:43:38,792 --> 00:43:40,927
We're not fucking superhumans.

1233
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:43,930
We can't excel in every single challenge.

1234
00:43:43,930 --> 00:43:45,165
So just because you trip,

1235
00:43:45,165 --> 00:43:47,434
and you fall, does not mean you can't get back up

1236
00:43:47,434 --> 00:43:49,736
and kill the next fucking challenge.

1237
00:43:49,736 --> 00:43:52,205
I understand that you're frustrated and

1238
00:43:52,239 --> 00:43:54,141
sometimes, you do fall. But,

1239
00:43:54,141 --> 00:43:55,308
this is a competition

1240
00:43:55,308 --> 00:43:56,543
and we're gonna tell you the truth.

1241
00:43:56,543 --> 00:43:58,779
But just know, that next week,

1242
00:43:58,779 --> 00:44:02,015
next week, there's an opportunity for you to slay again.

1243
00:44:02,015 --> 00:44:03,850
And I believe that you can do it, as well.

1244
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:06,486
So don't ever let that get to you.

1245
00:44:06,486 --> 00:44:07,654
Thank you, Pangina.

1246
00:44:07,654 --> 00:44:09,623
I'm sure your mom's proud of you,

1247
00:44:09,623 --> 00:44:13,326
- as much as I am proud of you.
- Thank you.

1248
00:44:14,261 --> 00:44:15,462
Viñas DeLuxe.

1249
00:44:15,462 --> 00:44:16,697
Hi!

1250
00:44:17,064 --> 00:44:18,965
You must not be hungry

1251
00:44:18,965 --> 00:44:20,634
because, bitch, you ate.

1252
00:44:21,301 --> 00:44:23,070
You fucking ate!

1253
00:44:23,070 --> 00:44:24,771
- When you turned the corner...
- Thank you.

1254
00:44:24,771 --> 00:44:26,339
The way you used the leaves

1255
00:44:26,339 --> 00:44:28,608
in every single area of that dress,

1256
00:44:28,608 --> 00:44:30,844
it is not crafty, it’s couture.

1257
00:44:31,178 --> 00:44:33,814
And honestly, when I saw the color of the leaves,

1258
00:44:33,814 --> 00:44:35,882
this is my least favorite

1259
00:44:36,850 --> 00:44:38,452
color of the leaves.

1260
00:44:38,452 --> 00:44:41,321
And you somehow turned it into this beautiful creation.

1261
00:44:41,321 --> 00:44:43,123
And every single step,

1262
00:44:43,123 --> 00:44:45,325
when you walked on the Runway, I was trying to clock.

1263
00:44:45,559 --> 00:44:49,429
Every single direction I was looking at the outfit,

1264
00:44:49,463 --> 00:44:51,064
I cannot say anything.

1265
00:44:51,164 --> 00:44:52,699
In a Design Challenge,

1266
00:44:52,699 --> 00:44:57,070
we are looking for creative expression,

1267
00:44:57,370 --> 00:44:58,572
execution,

1268
00:44:58,839 --> 00:45:01,908
and overall presentation.

1269
00:45:02,542 --> 00:45:03,877
And I can say

1270
00:45:03,877 --> 00:45:07,280
that you ticked all the boxes.

1271
00:45:07,481 --> 00:45:11,585
This is a million-dollar look, baby!

1272
00:45:11,585 --> 00:45:12,853
Come on!

1273
00:45:12,853 --> 00:45:15,722
And you're also an artist, Viñas.

1274
00:45:15,722 --> 00:45:17,357
It's very ethereal.

1275
00:45:17,657 --> 00:45:18,925
Wow.

1276
00:45:19,259 --> 00:45:24,664
The farmers who made those cacao leaves must be very proud of you.

1277
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:28,301
Thank you very much, Viñas.

1278
00:45:28,401 --> 00:45:30,470
This really means a lot to me, so thank you.

1279
00:45:30,470 --> 00:45:32,572
Thank you, thank you so much.

1280
00:45:32,773 --> 00:45:34,541
Suki Doll.

1281
00:45:34,541 --> 00:45:35,509
Good day!

1282
00:45:35,509 --> 00:45:37,377
Your outfit, for me,

1283
00:45:37,811 --> 00:45:40,013
is so expensive-looking.

1284
00:45:40,814 --> 00:45:43,850
It's giving me fashion, it's giving me

1285
00:45:43,850 --> 00:45:47,287
couture, and it's, it's so well thought of.

1286
00:45:47,287 --> 00:45:48,755
And I loved it.

1287
00:45:48,755 --> 00:45:49,923
Jervi.

1288
00:45:49,923 --> 00:45:52,926
My gosh, your look is amazing!

1289
00:45:52,926 --> 00:45:56,196
Teal is quite a tricky color when you mix it with

1290
00:45:56,596 --> 00:45:59,032
a non-complimentary color.

1291
00:45:59,032 --> 00:46:00,767
But that gold,

1292
00:46:00,901 --> 00:46:03,570
looks fabulous with the teal.

1293
00:46:04,070 --> 00:46:07,607
Very great choice, and I love how

1294
00:46:07,607 --> 00:46:09,609
cohesive the look is,

1295
00:46:09,609 --> 00:46:11,411
even your shoes!

1296
00:46:11,812 --> 00:46:13,246
So, I love it.

1297
00:46:13,246 --> 00:46:14,714
It looks so polished.

1298
00:46:15,081 --> 00:46:17,984
I just wish I could see your waist more.

1299
00:46:18,418 --> 00:46:20,053
I'll stop eating.

1300
00:46:20,821 --> 00:46:22,923
- Strike now.
- Yes.

1301
00:46:22,923 --> 00:46:24,624
But otherwise, I love that look.

1302
00:46:25,492 --> 00:46:27,294
You've proven yourself as a designer,

1303
00:46:27,294 --> 00:46:28,195
yet again, Suki Doll.

1304
00:46:28,195 --> 00:46:29,496
Thank you.

1305
00:46:29,496 --> 00:46:32,432
Actually, I know I didn't choose this color. And,

1306
00:46:32,432 --> 00:46:36,570
- I was the last one to get it...Yes.
- Yes, you were given the disadvantage.

1307
00:46:36,570 --> 00:46:39,105
But honestly, on my season, four years ago,

1308
00:46:39,105 --> 00:46:42,175
I also chose to do, in the Design Challenge, a teal dress.

1309
00:46:42,576 --> 00:46:45,011
And that teal dress

1310
00:46:45,011 --> 00:46:46,546
meant something for me because

1311
00:46:46,546 --> 00:46:49,082
a friend of mine, Alison,

1312
00:46:49,082 --> 00:46:51,084
passed away from cancer.

1313
00:46:51,084 --> 00:46:52,118
And she...

1314
00:46:52,118 --> 00:46:55,689
This color represents the type of cancer she had, which is not curable yet.

1315
00:46:55,689 --> 00:46:58,291
And the fact that I got this color,

1316
00:46:58,291 --> 00:47:00,827
really meant a lot to me even if I didn't choose it.

1317
00:47:00,827 --> 00:47:03,697
So, I'm happy to bring this back and have a full circle moment from my season.

1318
00:47:03,697 --> 00:47:04,631
To come back here

1319
00:47:04,931 --> 00:47:06,566
and be able to represent her again,

1320
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:08,235
and be in the top again, for this.

1321
00:47:08,702 --> 00:47:10,470
And I just think

1322
00:47:10,470 --> 00:47:12,639
everything happens for a reason in life, and

1323
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:14,341
this moment was meant to be happening.

1324
00:47:15,075 --> 00:47:16,776
Thank you for sharing your story, Suki.

1325
00:47:17,777 --> 00:47:18,979
Thank you, ladies.

1326
00:47:19,446 --> 00:47:20,780
I think we've heard enough.

1327
00:47:21,948 --> 00:47:26,052
Based on your Holy Cacao Runway looks, we have made some decisions.

1328
00:47:30,257 --> 00:47:31,558
Suki Doll,

1329
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:35,061
you are safe.

1330
00:47:37,998 --> 00:47:39,232
Siam Phusri,

1331
00:47:42,535 --> 00:47:43,503
you are also safe.

1332
00:47:46,806 --> 00:47:48,508
Viñas DeLuxe.

1333
00:47:50,043 --> 00:47:51,444
Kitty Space.

1334
00:47:52,746 --> 00:47:56,683
Condragulations, you are the Top 2 Slaysians of the week.

1335
00:47:56,683 --> 00:47:57,918
Thank you.

1336
00:47:58,852 --> 00:48:00,487
That means,

1337
00:48:00,487 --> 00:48:02,122
Arizona Brandy

1338
00:48:02,255 --> 00:48:03,723
and Ivory Glaze,

1339
00:48:04,925 --> 00:48:06,192
you are both, in the bottom.

1340
00:48:07,994 --> 00:48:11,531
Viñas DeLuxe, and Kitty Space, each of you

1341
00:48:11,531 --> 00:48:13,099
needs to decide which

1342
00:48:13,099 --> 00:48:16,069
of the Bottom 2, you will eliminate,

1343
00:48:16,136 --> 00:48:18,071
if you win the lip sync.

1344
00:48:19,572 --> 00:48:21,942
So while you queens deliberate in the Werkroom,

1345
00:48:21,942 --> 00:48:25,478
the judges and I, will make sampaguita necklaces,

1346
00:48:25,478 --> 00:48:27,681
as an offering to my beauty.

1347
00:48:28,815 --> 00:48:31,418
You may leave the stage, queens.

1348
00:48:36,656 --> 00:48:38,758
So who do we think is gonna be on top?

1349
00:48:39,693 --> 00:48:41,294
Suki and Viñas for sure.

1350
00:48:41,294 --> 00:48:42,395
- Yes!
- Me too!

1351
00:48:42,395 --> 00:48:43,930
Me too, Suki and Viñas.

1352
00:48:43,930 --> 00:48:44,597
Yeah.

1353
00:48:44,597 --> 00:48:46,666
So given, Suki and Viñas.

1354
00:48:46,666 --> 00:48:48,068
I thought you were gonna be on top.

1355
00:48:48,068 --> 00:48:48,668
Thank you.

1356
00:48:50,003 --> 00:48:51,304
Actually...

1357
00:48:54,407 --> 00:48:55,041
Kidding!

1358
00:48:55,041 --> 00:48:56,810
It's okay! It's fine, really.

1359
00:48:56,810 --> 00:48:58,979
Okay, so we think Suki and Viñas are in the top.

1360
00:48:59,346 --> 00:49:00,480
Who else is gonna be on top?

1361
00:49:00,780 --> 00:49:02,882
It's gonna be Siam or Arizona.

1362
00:49:03,316 --> 00:49:04,250
I think Arizona.

1363
00:49:04,250 --> 00:49:05,352
- I think Arizona as well.
- Arizona...

1364
00:49:05,352 --> 00:49:06,219
I think Arizona.

1365
00:49:06,219 --> 00:49:09,055
has a more cleaner silhouette.

1366
00:49:09,055 --> 00:49:10,724
And the part with the plating was beautiful.

1367
00:49:10,757 --> 00:49:12,993
- The plating, I was so amazed.
- Yeah.

1368
00:49:13,026 --> 00:49:15,161
Shall we talk about the bottom?

1369
00:49:15,261 --> 00:49:16,596
- Yeah, okay.
- Who do we think is gonna be in the bottom?

1370
00:49:16,596 --> 00:49:19,265
I think it's gonna be...

1371
00:49:19,299 --> 00:49:21,334
I was not expecting for Kitty to be there.

1372
00:49:22,202 --> 00:49:23,536
- Really.
- Actually, me too.

1373
00:49:23,570 --> 00:49:25,338
Because the thing is, I told her.

1374
00:49:25,405 --> 00:49:27,841
- Do something with the bottom half of her outfit.
- Yes!

1375
00:49:27,874 --> 00:49:28,408
Keep the blue.

1376
00:49:28,408 --> 00:49:30,477
She was like, no I'm not gonna do it.

1377
00:49:30,510 --> 00:49:32,612
- And then she started working on the white fabric, I'm like girl,
- She had a headdress.

1378
00:49:32,612 --> 00:49:34,981
- the white fabric looks cheap as fuck.
- You have a...

1379
00:49:34,981 --> 00:49:36,116
And then she got rid of that.

1380
00:49:36,149 --> 00:49:36,916
I don't know

1381
00:49:36,916 --> 00:49:38,952
- what happened afterwards.
- For me, the outfit is okay.

1382
00:49:38,952 --> 00:49:40,453
- The top is okay.
- But the gloves are a no.

1383
00:49:40,487 --> 00:49:40,954
Yeah!

1384
00:49:40,954 --> 00:49:42,856
- Yeah, and the boots!
- The gloves are a no.

1385
00:49:42,856 --> 00:49:43,957
And the boots!

1386
00:49:44,157 --> 00:49:44,924
I'm always hungry.

1387
00:49:44,924 --> 00:49:46,292
Always hungry.

1388
00:49:46,326 --> 00:49:47,394
What's happening?

1389
00:49:47,394 --> 00:49:50,330
Oh, my God!

1390
00:49:50,330 --> 00:49:51,598
I was so happy.

1391
00:49:51,598 --> 00:49:52,699
I'm so happy.

1392
00:49:52,699 --> 00:49:54,434
When Mama Pao told me I'm so...

1393
00:49:54,434 --> 00:49:56,102
I'm beautiful and she likes my outfit,

1394
00:49:56,102 --> 00:49:57,971
I'm so happy because...

1395
00:49:57,971 --> 00:49:58,938
I...

1396
00:49:58,972 --> 00:50:00,273
All the pressure was like...

1397
00:50:00,774 --> 00:50:01,674
I did it.

1398
00:50:01,708 --> 00:50:04,077
We want y'all to guess

1399
00:50:04,077 --> 00:50:05,645
who's in the top,

1400
00:50:05,645 --> 00:50:07,313
and who's in the bottom.

1401
00:50:07,714 --> 00:50:08,948
I'm guessing...

1402
00:50:09,649 --> 00:50:11,351
All of you are gonna go home.

1403
00:50:13,420 --> 00:50:16,189
Our tops are Viñas and Suki.

1404
00:50:16,189 --> 00:50:17,190
And Arizona.

1405
00:50:17,190 --> 00:50:18,425
You're so big, bitch.

1406
00:50:18,458 --> 00:50:19,893
What about the bottoms?

1407
00:50:19,893 --> 00:50:20,994
Like who did you guess?

1408
00:50:20,994 --> 00:50:23,496
We think the bottoms are...

1409
00:50:23,496 --> 00:50:24,898
- You, darling.
- Yes.

1410
00:50:24,964 --> 00:50:27,133
And you.

1411
00:50:27,133 --> 00:50:27,867
And Siam also.

1412
00:50:27,867 --> 00:50:28,568
Siam.

1413
00:50:28,568 --> 00:50:29,869
- That's what they're saying.
- Yeah, I'm...

1414
00:50:29,903 --> 00:50:31,271
I'm in the Bottom 2.

1415
00:50:31,271 --> 00:50:31,938
Oh.

1416
00:50:31,938 --> 00:50:32,839
- Two?!
- Huh?

1417
00:50:32,839 --> 00:50:33,506
Yeah.

1418
00:50:33,506 --> 00:50:35,141
- Oh yes, she is.
- With who?

1419
00:50:35,141 --> 00:50:35,842
With...

1420
00:50:35,842 --> 00:50:36,643
Me.

1421
00:50:36,743 --> 00:50:38,845
- Ivory.
- Oh, really?!

1422
00:50:39,746 --> 00:50:41,147
Oh... That shocked me.

1423
00:50:41,147 --> 00:50:42,515
Because I thought,

1424
00:50:42,916 --> 00:50:46,119
Arizona Brandy got my spot

1425
00:50:46,152 --> 00:50:47,087
at the top.

1426
00:50:47,253 --> 00:50:48,621
And you are in the top?

1427
00:50:48,621 --> 00:50:49,489
Yeah.

1428
00:50:49,489 --> 00:50:51,191
- Wow!
- Really?

1429
00:50:51,591 --> 00:50:52,692
- It was Viñas.
- What about the Top 2?

1430
00:50:52,692 --> 00:50:54,894
- What was that reaction? Really...
- Reveal the Top 2.

1431
00:50:54,894 --> 00:50:57,530
Suki will be Top 2 with Viñas.

1432
00:50:57,730 --> 00:50:58,598
Wow!

1433
00:50:58,598 --> 00:51:00,567
Do I agree with the Top 3?

1434
00:51:01,134 --> 00:51:01,734
Somewhat.

1435
00:51:01,734 --> 00:51:02,669
Kitty Space, no.

1436
00:51:02,669 --> 00:51:04,504
But Suki and Viñas, yes.

1437
00:51:04,704 --> 00:51:05,905
It was a...

1438
00:51:06,206 --> 00:51:08,074
An amazing moment for me.

1439
00:51:08,074 --> 00:51:09,142
It's a

1440
00:51:09,142 --> 00:51:11,177
full circle moment because...

1441
00:51:11,211 --> 00:51:13,580
my last Design Challenge in Drag Race,

1442
00:51:13,580 --> 00:51:14,781
was a flop.

1443
00:51:14,781 --> 00:51:16,149
I went home.

1444
00:51:16,149 --> 00:51:17,584
This is proof

1445
00:51:17,650 --> 00:51:21,988
that I was not just lucky in the first Design Challenge.

1446
00:51:21,988 --> 00:51:24,657
I really just tripped during that challenge.

1447
00:51:24,958 --> 00:51:25,992
Literally!

1448
00:51:26,025 --> 00:51:26,826
Can we be honest?

1449
00:51:26,826 --> 00:51:27,961
We all predicted

1450
00:51:27,961 --> 00:51:29,963
that it was gonna be those 2

1451
00:51:30,196 --> 00:51:31,030
who are gonna be on the top.

1452
00:51:31,030 --> 00:51:32,632
- Not to take away-
- Yeah, I know.

1453
00:51:32,632 --> 00:51:34,200
But you did great.

1454
00:51:34,234 --> 00:51:35,702
Let's celebrate it regardless.

1455
00:51:35,702 --> 00:51:36,269
Yeah.

1456
00:51:36,269 --> 00:51:37,604
But just in case you watch it back,

1457
00:51:37,604 --> 00:51:38,805
and tell me like, what?!

1458
00:51:38,805 --> 00:51:40,039
We talked so much shit about you.

1459
00:51:40,039 --> 00:51:41,641
- Yes, we did.
- Oh wow.

1460
00:51:43,476 --> 00:51:44,944
You think I'm not good enough?

1461
00:51:47,013 --> 00:51:48,515
I was really disappointed.

1462
00:51:49,282 --> 00:51:50,250
Okay, girls.

1463
00:51:50,250 --> 00:51:51,784
I don't think we should tear Kitty down.

1464
00:51:51,784 --> 00:51:53,586
Because, like, we have different opinions.

1465
00:51:53,586 --> 00:51:55,054
I think she had had

1466
00:51:55,121 --> 00:51:56,656
a rougher start, obviously,

1467
00:51:56,656 --> 00:51:58,558
with the other episodes.

1468
00:51:58,558 --> 00:51:59,959
And I think she's an—

1469
00:51:59,959 --> 00:52:02,228
amazing sister, amazing drag artist.

1470
00:52:02,362 --> 00:52:03,563
What's not okay,

1471
00:52:03,563 --> 00:52:04,998
is for Kitty to be going back home

1472
00:52:04,998 --> 00:52:06,299
thinking that she's not good enough

1473
00:52:06,299 --> 00:52:07,967
or she doesn't deserve a win.

1474
00:52:07,967 --> 00:52:09,269
So I want her to win

1475
00:52:09,269 --> 00:52:10,336
in the proper way.

1476
00:52:10,336 --> 00:52:11,704
And I want her to be celebrated.

1477
00:52:11,704 --> 00:52:13,306
And I don't want us to take away

1478
00:52:13,306 --> 00:52:14,807
anything that is hers.

1479
00:52:14,841 --> 00:52:18,178
Congratulations, Kitty Space!

1480
00:52:18,178 --> 00:52:19,345
“Yeah, Kitty!”

1481
00:52:19,345 --> 00:52:20,180
I...

1482
00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:21,314
I found it fake.

1483
00:52:23,082 --> 00:52:25,585
They kinda ruined my big moment, you know.

1484
00:52:26,352 --> 00:52:26,986
Look,

1485
00:52:26,986 --> 00:52:28,521
I'm not gonna lie, I'm not shocked.

1486
00:52:28,988 --> 00:52:30,089
Like I feel awful,

1487
00:52:30,089 --> 00:52:32,091
because I love you all.

1488
00:52:32,225 --> 00:52:34,194
And I don't wanna put any queen down

1489
00:52:34,727 --> 00:52:36,062
to plead my case.

1490
00:52:36,262 --> 00:52:38,731
It's just everyone thinks of me

1491
00:52:38,865 --> 00:52:40,266
through failure.

1492
00:52:40,366 --> 00:52:42,135
And I just—I cannot

1493
00:52:42,135 --> 00:52:43,770
I cannot let it end this way.

1494
00:52:43,770 --> 00:52:44,704
And I

1495
00:52:44,704 --> 00:52:47,774
know I could do well in the challenges coming up.

1496
00:52:47,807 --> 00:52:49,342
I just feel that

1497
00:52:49,342 --> 00:52:50,476
right now,

1498
00:52:51,477 --> 00:52:53,580
like I've just had a string of bad luck.

1499
00:52:53,613 --> 00:52:55,882
I am in the bottom with Arizona,

1500
00:52:55,882 --> 00:52:58,184
who was in the Top 2 last week.

1501
00:52:58,184 --> 00:52:59,152
So like,

1502
00:52:59,152 --> 00:53:01,487
if the girls are going to

1503
00:53:01,487 --> 00:53:03,189
kind of go by what they said earlier

1504
00:53:03,189 --> 00:53:05,225
where they said they will go by track record,

1505
00:53:05,225 --> 00:53:06,326
I'm fucked!

1506
00:53:06,693 --> 00:53:08,261
How do you feel, Arizona?

1507
00:53:08,528 --> 00:53:10,530
I don't know how to feel actually.

1508
00:53:10,863 --> 00:53:11,965
We thought you were safe.

1509
00:53:12,265 --> 00:53:14,234
I'm so embarrassed.

1510
00:53:17,203 --> 00:53:19,105
I'm so embarrassed.

1511
00:53:23,142 --> 00:53:24,377
Because...

1512
00:53:25,445 --> 00:53:27,213
I'm so embarrassed.

1513
00:53:28,281 --> 00:53:29,816
Because...

1514
00:53:31,384 --> 00:53:34,120
I was just at the top and then,

1515
00:53:34,187 --> 00:53:36,556
I fell again, here.

1516
00:53:37,123 --> 00:53:39,525
And then I see like my Filipino—

1517
00:53:39,525 --> 00:53:40,493
I'm sorry I'm—

1518
00:53:40,493 --> 00:53:41,928
I don't wanna fucking cry,

1519
00:53:41,928 --> 00:53:42,729
I don't wanna—

1520
00:53:42,729 --> 00:53:45,398
I don't wanna look like I'm pleading, or I'm begging.

1521
00:53:45,398 --> 00:53:46,366
I don't wanna look like that.

1522
00:53:46,366 --> 00:53:47,367
I'm sorry.

1523
00:53:47,367 --> 00:53:49,369
I thought we're really doing good.

1524
00:53:49,402 --> 00:53:51,638
Like everybody's on top or safe.

1525
00:53:51,638 --> 00:53:52,438
Like no one—

1526
00:53:52,438 --> 00:53:54,841
No Filipino queen has been in the bottom and

1527
00:53:54,841 --> 00:53:58,077
it's so embarrassing to be the first one there.

1528
00:53:58,378 --> 00:54:01,447
I prepared myself for the Design Challenge.

1529
00:54:02,148 --> 00:54:04,250
I did bad on my season.

1530
00:54:04,250 --> 00:54:06,719
I did really bad.

1531
00:54:06,786 --> 00:54:07,754
And

1532
00:54:07,787 --> 00:54:10,690
all I did was to lip sync for my life.

1533
00:54:10,690 --> 00:54:11,357
Like,

1534
00:54:11,357 --> 00:54:13,459
if you all watch my season,

1535
00:54:13,660 --> 00:54:16,095
I was struggling every time,

1536
00:54:16,095 --> 00:54:18,231
but I know I could save myself,

1537
00:54:18,765 --> 00:54:20,767
lip syncing for my life.

1538
00:54:21,367 --> 00:54:22,368
But,

1539
00:54:22,435 --> 00:54:24,637
it's in your hands.

1540
00:54:24,637 --> 00:54:27,073
I really felt like...

1541
00:54:27,106 --> 00:54:29,042
I also felt

1542
00:54:29,108 --> 00:54:30,910
what Ari felt because,

1543
00:54:30,910 --> 00:54:33,780
Ari being in the bottom, is like me being in the bottom too.

1544
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:36,015
I wanna stay because

1545
00:54:36,182 --> 00:54:37,917
this is not how I end.

1546
00:54:38,284 --> 00:54:40,620
This is still me, I love this outfit.

1547
00:54:42,021 --> 00:54:44,657
I know I'm gonna excel in other challenges.

1548
00:54:44,657 --> 00:54:46,225
I'm not just like,

1549
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:48,961
"I hope I'm lucky next week."

1550
00:54:48,961 --> 00:54:49,729
I'm not.

1551
00:54:49,829 --> 00:54:52,932
No, I know I'm gonna excel in the following weeks.

1552
00:54:53,333 --> 00:54:55,134
If I wanna win easily,

1553
00:54:55,134 --> 00:54:57,837
I can take down the toughest competitor.

1554
00:54:58,738 --> 00:55:00,073
But...

1555
00:55:00,139 --> 00:55:02,008
I'll be in trouble with her fans, kidding!

1556
00:55:03,609 --> 00:55:05,244
With Kitty, I...

1557
00:55:05,244 --> 00:55:07,613
Like she's become quickly one of my like

1558
00:55:07,613 --> 00:55:09,115
best friends in this competition.

1559
00:55:09,115 --> 00:55:11,651
Like we are very close and I think,

1560
00:55:11,651 --> 00:55:13,119
she,

1561
00:55:13,152 --> 00:55:15,421
I think she's got my back, you know.

1562
00:55:15,455 --> 00:55:18,091
If we can lip sync for our lives,

1563
00:55:18,124 --> 00:55:20,093
I'm gonna stay, I know that.

1564
00:55:20,159 --> 00:55:22,995
But this time, our fate is in

1565
00:55:23,029 --> 00:55:24,163
other girls' hands.

1566
00:55:24,163 --> 00:55:26,799
So I trust Viñas,

1567
00:55:26,799 --> 00:55:28,701
I hope she saves me.

1568
00:55:31,070 --> 00:55:33,406
It's hard to decide because

1569
00:55:33,573 --> 00:55:35,942
they both want to prove something, right?

1570
00:55:35,942 --> 00:55:39,178
They both want to recover from their

1571
00:55:39,178 --> 00:55:41,381
regular seasons.

1572
00:55:41,514 --> 00:55:42,548
But,

1573
00:55:42,548 --> 00:55:44,817
I also want to prove something.

1574
00:55:44,851 --> 00:55:46,319
My

1575
00:55:46,319 --> 00:55:48,020
integrity.

1576
00:55:48,054 --> 00:55:49,622
So let's see.

1577
00:55:53,860 --> 00:55:55,027
I'm lost.

1578
00:55:55,027 --> 00:55:57,130
I don't want to eliminate anyone.

1579
00:55:57,130 --> 00:55:59,432
I know if I eliminate Arizona,

1580
00:55:59,432 --> 00:56:00,466
she will be mad.

1581
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:03,436
And because it's a Pinoy queen,

1582
00:56:03,436 --> 00:56:05,938
and she's in her country.

1583
00:56:05,972 --> 00:56:07,573
And in another way,

1584
00:56:07,573 --> 00:56:08,975
if I eliminate Ivory,

1585
00:56:08,975 --> 00:56:11,344
I feel like I will betray my friend.

1586
00:56:11,411 --> 00:56:12,578
So,

1587
00:56:12,578 --> 00:56:13,913
I didn’t know really well.

1588
00:56:13,913 --> 00:56:15,648
And I don't want to eliminate anyone.

1589
00:56:15,648 --> 00:56:17,850
But I have to choose one, but I don't want to.

1590
00:56:23,322 --> 00:56:25,792
Alright, just between us sampaguita ladies,

1591
00:56:25,958 --> 00:56:28,060
do you know that this flower,

1592
00:56:28,060 --> 00:56:29,462
the Sampaguita,

1593
00:56:29,462 --> 00:56:32,165
symbolizes purity and simplicity.

1594
00:56:32,632 --> 00:56:35,968
The total and complete opposite of both of you.

1595
00:56:36,002 --> 00:56:37,003
Sluts.

1596
00:56:38,337 --> 00:56:39,439
Mama Pao,

1597
00:56:39,439 --> 00:56:41,641
how much do we sell this for?

1598
00:56:41,674 --> 00:56:42,875
Well,

1599
00:56:42,909 --> 00:56:45,044
we can sell it around 35 to 50,

1600
00:56:45,044 --> 00:56:46,979
but if they have a manager's check,

1601
00:56:46,979 --> 00:56:48,181
then it's okay.

1602
00:56:48,881 --> 00:56:52,018
Don’t worry, I’ll buy them all!

1603
00:56:52,485 --> 00:56:53,319
Alright!

1604
00:56:53,319 --> 00:56:56,255
Now, bring back my sweet girls!

1605
00:56:58,691 --> 00:57:01,494
Welcome back, ladies.

1606
00:57:03,162 --> 00:57:06,332
Two top Slaysians stand before me.

1607
00:57:06,399 --> 00:57:07,667
Prior to tonight,

1608
00:57:07,667 --> 00:57:10,937
you were asked to prepare a lip sync performance of

1609
00:57:10,937 --> 00:57:14,073
“Winna Winna” by Pangina Heals.

1610
00:57:15,942 --> 00:57:18,144
This is your chance to impress me

1611
00:57:18,144 --> 00:57:20,246
and win 80,000 pesos.

1612
00:57:20,246 --> 00:57:25,284
Plus a one-year supply of Auro products courtesy of Auro Chocolate.

1613
00:57:25,518 --> 00:57:28,821
You will also earn the power to give one of the bottom queens,

1614
00:57:28,855 --> 00:57:30,690
the karate chop!

1615
00:57:30,723 --> 00:57:32,992
Hiya!

1616
00:57:34,894 --> 00:57:36,362
The time has come

1617
00:57:36,429 --> 00:57:38,898
for you to Lip Sync

1618
00:57:39,098 --> 00:57:42,368
for your Legacy!

1619
00:57:45,738 --> 00:57:47,206
To Kitty,

1620
00:57:47,373 --> 00:57:48,608
Hello!

1621
00:57:50,276 --> 00:57:51,644
Hello Kitty, kidding!

1622
00:57:51,644 --> 00:57:53,946
Good luck, Kitty.

1623
00:57:54,647 --> 00:57:56,549
I'm so proud to be in the top.

1624
00:57:56,549 --> 00:57:57,717
But I can win.

1625
00:57:57,717 --> 00:58:00,319
And winning on an episode,

1626
00:58:00,353 --> 00:58:03,356
where I got eliminated in my season,

1627
00:58:03,356 --> 00:58:05,491
will represent so much for me, like

1628
00:58:05,491 --> 00:58:06,626
I need this.

1629
00:58:06,626 --> 00:58:08,127
Good luck, queens.

1630
00:58:08,127 --> 00:58:10,129
And don't fuck it up.

1631
00:58:18,070 --> 00:58:19,906
I’m a winnah, winnah

1632
00:58:19,906 --> 00:58:21,674
Nevah been a quitah

1633
00:58:21,674 --> 00:58:23,576
I walk the walk, talk the talk

1634
00:58:23,576 --> 00:58:25,244
Look what I can give yah

1635
00:58:25,611 --> 00:58:27,446
I’m a winnah, winnah

1636
00:58:27,446 --> 00:58:29,215
I’m your chicken dinnah (dinner)

1637
00:58:29,215 --> 00:58:31,117
Spicy hot, can’t be stopped

1638
00:58:31,117 --> 00:58:32,785
Baby I delivah (deliver)

1639
00:58:33,352 --> 00:58:35,187
Come hurry onto the beat

1640
00:58:35,187 --> 00:58:36,956
Just taste my lips they’re so sweet

1641
00:58:36,956 --> 00:58:38,858
My moves will make you squeal

1642
00:58:38,858 --> 00:58:40,526
And my mothering appeal

1643
00:58:40,893 --> 00:58:42,728
Don’t think you’ll stop and stare

1644
00:58:42,728 --> 00:58:44,497
You’ll see me everywhere

1645
00:58:44,497 --> 00:58:46,399
I’m living out my pride

1646
00:58:46,399 --> 00:58:48,067
Let me take you for a ride

1647
00:58:48,301 --> 00:58:51,871
Workin at 3 clubs at night (till the sun comes up)

1648
00:58:52,038 --> 00:58:55,608
I was young, I brought the fight, (Pangina don’t give up)

1649
00:58:55,908 --> 00:58:59,478
Broken wings, I learned to fly, (had to be so tough)

1650
00:58:59,712 --> 00:59:03,282
I’m the queen you can’t deny, (now you can’t get enough)

1651
00:59:03,683 --> 00:59:05,518
Hustle in and out in the heat

1652
00:59:05,518 --> 00:59:07,286
The streets of Silom and Sukhumvit

1653
00:59:07,286 --> 00:59:09,188
Jumpin’ and dancin’ and whackin’

1654
00:59:09,188 --> 00:59:10,856
and grindin’ all night long

1655
00:59:11,223 --> 00:59:13,059
And now I’m dominating

1656
00:59:13,059 --> 00:59:14,827
I’m crushin all the hating

1657
00:59:14,827 --> 00:59:16,729
From Thailand to LA

1658
00:59:16,729 --> 00:59:18,397
Pangina Heals, let’s hear you say,

1659
00:59:18,531 --> 00:59:20,366
I’m a winnah, winnah

1660
00:59:20,366 --> 00:59:22,134
Nevah been a quitah

1661
00:59:22,134 --> 00:59:24,036
I walk the walk, talk the talk

1662
00:59:24,036 --> 00:59:25,705
Look what I can give yah

1663
00:59:26,072 --> 00:59:27,907
I’m a winnah, winnah

1664
00:59:27,907 --> 00:59:29,675
I’m your chicken dinnah (dinner)

1665
00:59:29,675 --> 00:59:31,577
Spicy hot, can’t be stopped

1666
00:59:31,577 --> 00:59:33,245
Baby I delivah (deliver)

1667
00:59:36,349 --> 00:59:37,550
Fight for your life

1668
00:59:43,189 --> 00:59:44,924
Pangina Heals, baby

1669
00:59:46,859 --> 00:59:48,694
One, two, three, let’s go

1670
00:59:48,894 --> 00:59:50,730
Now I got House Of Heals

1671
00:59:50,730 --> 00:59:52,498
Making deals with no appeals

1672
00:59:52,498 --> 00:59:54,400
Still jumpin, dancin’ and whackin’

1673
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:55,735
and grindin’ all night long

1674
00:59:55,735 --> 00:59:56,235
- Go Kitty!
- and grindin’ all night long

1675
00:59:56,235 --> 00:59:58,004
- Go Kitty please!
- I’m keepin’ up the pride

1676
00:59:58,004 --> 00:59:59,238
- Oh shit, she don't know the words.
- As long as I’m alive

1677
00:59:59,238 --> 01:00:00,139
- I'm fucked.
- As long as I’m alive

1678
01:00:00,139 --> 01:00:01,807
Don’t you cry, dry your eyes

1679
01:00:01,807 --> 01:00:03,709
Because you know I will survive!

1680
01:00:04,010 --> 01:00:05,911
You know I will survive!

1681
01:00:07,446 --> 01:00:09,281
I’m a winnah, winnah

1682
01:00:09,281 --> 01:00:11,050
Nevah been a quitah

1683
01:00:11,050 --> 01:00:12,952
I walk the walk, talk the talk

1684
01:00:12,952 --> 01:00:14,620
Look what I can give yah

1685
01:00:15,588 --> 01:00:17,123
I'm sorry, Kitty.

1686
01:00:17,123 --> 01:00:18,691
That's my sister there.

1687
01:00:18,691 --> 01:00:21,727
She won't rest until that win is hers.

1688
01:00:22,528 --> 01:00:24,363
I’m a winnah, winnah

1689
01:00:24,363 --> 01:00:26,132
I’m your chicken dinnah (dinner)

1690
01:00:26,132 --> 01:00:27,900
Spicy hot, can’t be stopped

1691
01:00:27,900 --> 01:00:29,568
Baby I delivah (deliver)

1692
01:00:30,636 --> 01:00:31,771
Stupid!

1693
01:00:35,574 --> 01:00:37,410
I’m a winnah, winnah

1694
01:00:43,215 --> 01:00:45,017
Baby I delivah (deliver)

1695
01:00:53,693 --> 01:00:55,661
Queens, I’ve made my decision.

1696
01:01:00,399 --> 01:01:02,568
Viñas DeLuxe,

1697
01:01:03,135 --> 01:01:05,538
you’re a winner baby!

1698
01:01:06,605 --> 01:01:07,973
Condragulations!

1699
01:01:07,973 --> 01:01:11,043
You’ve earned a cash tip of 80,000 pesos

1700
01:01:11,043 --> 01:01:14,747
plus a one year supply of Auro products courtesy of Auro Chocolate.

1701
01:01:15,014 --> 01:01:17,450
You also get a RuBadge!

1702
01:01:17,450 --> 01:01:19,318
Give her a RuBadge!

1703
01:01:19,418 --> 01:01:21,954
Wear it with Slaysian pride, Viñas.

1704
01:01:21,954 --> 01:01:24,356
Thank you!

1705
01:01:24,390 --> 01:01:25,491
Oh, my God!

1706
01:01:25,491 --> 01:01:26,859
Thank you! Thank you, so much!

1707
01:01:26,859 --> 01:01:27,860
Another?!

1708
01:01:27,860 --> 01:01:31,097
Another Design Challenge, and I won again.

1709
01:01:31,564 --> 01:01:33,566
Condragulations, Kitty Space.

1710
01:01:33,999 --> 01:01:34,967
You are safe.

1711
01:01:34,967 --> 01:01:36,736
You may join the other queens, Kitty Space.

1712
01:01:36,736 --> 01:01:39,004
Very good, Kitty Space.

1713
01:01:39,038 --> 01:01:39,939
Congrats, Kitty!

1714
01:01:42,508 --> 01:01:44,210
Now...

1715
01:01:44,643 --> 01:01:46,912
Will the bottom queens

1716
01:01:46,912 --> 01:01:49,482
please step forward.

1717
01:01:50,082 --> 01:01:54,587
Please Viñas, I hope you didn't get Ari's lipstick.

1718
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:03,262
Viñas DeLuxe,

1719
01:02:03,329 --> 01:02:06,232
with great power from our Slaysian ancestors

1720
01:02:06,232 --> 01:02:08,934
comes great responsibility.

1721
01:02:09,235 --> 01:02:12,838
Which queen have you chosen to get the karate chop?

1722
01:02:13,906 --> 01:02:15,474
Oh, my God, Mama Pao.

1723
01:02:15,474 --> 01:02:17,676
This decision is actually

1724
01:02:17,710 --> 01:02:19,578
so hard for me because

1725
01:02:19,612 --> 01:02:21,981
I don't know who to eliminate.

1726
01:02:22,448 --> 01:02:25,384
My biggest threat in the competition,

1727
01:02:25,985 --> 01:02:28,120
or my biggest crush, kidding!

1728
01:02:29,889 --> 01:02:31,123
But,

1729
01:02:31,123 --> 01:02:33,125
I have to

1730
01:02:33,559 --> 01:02:35,361
stay

1731
01:02:35,394 --> 01:02:38,297
with my belief and,

1732
01:02:38,330 --> 01:02:40,800
the queen that I have chosen to get the chop,

1733
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:43,502
the karate chop rather, is...

1734
01:02:43,869 --> 01:02:45,504
I'm sorry, sister.

1735
01:02:48,073 --> 01:02:49,208
Ivory.

1736
01:02:52,011 --> 01:02:53,612
Ivory Glaze.

1737
01:02:54,013 --> 01:02:55,381
As it is written,

1738
01:02:55,381 --> 01:02:57,082
so it shall be done.

1739
01:02:57,483 --> 01:03:00,319
The stunner from Down Under.

1740
01:03:00,352 --> 01:03:03,055
You'll always be a Slaysian sensation.

1741
01:03:05,391 --> 01:03:06,525
I came

1742
01:03:06,525 --> 01:03:08,527
to this season to try and

1743
01:03:08,527 --> 01:03:10,095
rewrite

1744
01:03:10,095 --> 01:03:11,964
some of the damage

1745
01:03:11,997 --> 01:03:13,732
that happened last time.

1746
01:03:14,433 --> 01:03:17,069
Unfortunately, it didn't get to end that way.

1747
01:03:17,069 --> 01:03:18,637
But, to my friends

1748
01:03:18,637 --> 01:03:21,240
and my partner who worked very hard to help me,

1749
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:23,342
I love you all and

1750
01:03:23,375 --> 01:03:24,410
good luck.

1751
01:03:24,410 --> 01:03:25,444
Have fun

1752
01:03:25,444 --> 01:03:27,780
with no one attractive left in the cast.

1753
01:03:30,649 --> 01:03:31,984
Thank you, I love you, girl.

1754
01:03:33,519 --> 01:03:35,588
Thank you, Ivory Glaze.

1755
01:03:36,522 --> 01:03:38,090
Now, sashay away.

1756
01:03:39,525 --> 01:03:42,294
- Bye, Ivory!
- Bye, Ivory!

1757
01:03:45,331 --> 01:03:48,000
If I faint again can I stay next episode?

1758
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:48,467
Yes.

1759
01:03:48,500 --> 01:03:49,635
Yes? Oh, okay.

1760
01:03:56,275 --> 01:03:57,309
Medic!

1761
01:03:57,376 --> 01:03:59,144
- Medic!
- Medic!

1762
01:04:00,779 --> 01:04:02,982
Okay, fine I'll go, Jesus!

1763
01:04:04,183 --> 01:04:05,684
Airtime, kidding!

1764
01:04:09,188 --> 01:04:11,290
I'm feeling pretty terrible right now.

1765
01:04:11,891 --> 01:04:13,158
But,

1766
01:04:13,259 --> 01:04:14,793
it's okay.

1767
01:04:15,060 --> 01:04:17,029
You know, things happen.

1768
01:04:18,330 --> 01:04:20,199
I would like people to remember me

1769
01:04:20,232 --> 01:04:21,734
as not sweaty

1770
01:04:21,734 --> 01:04:23,569
and very competent.

1771
01:04:23,669 --> 01:04:25,537
I would like you remember me that way.

1772
01:04:26,105 --> 01:04:28,207
And not by whatever you just saw.

1773
01:04:28,207 --> 01:04:29,909
My heart is full, getting to meet them.

1774
01:04:29,909 --> 01:04:33,145
And I feel so honored to be part of this season.

1775
01:04:33,379 --> 01:04:35,981
Good bye, Werkroom, and remember...

1776
01:04:35,981 --> 01:04:37,449
Putangina! (Your mother is a whore!)

1777
01:04:37,483 --> 01:04:39,485
It means good morning, I learned that over here.

1778
01:04:39,551 --> 01:04:41,453
Alright, bye!

1779
01:04:43,489 --> 01:04:45,357
Condragulations, Queens!

1780
01:04:45,357 --> 01:04:47,626
You all made your mothers proud!

1781
01:04:47,626 --> 01:04:48,727
So here I say,

1782
01:04:48,727 --> 01:04:50,296
your mothers are all Queens!

1783
01:04:50,296 --> 01:04:52,398
- Your mother is a queen too!
- Your mother is a queen too!

1784
01:04:52,398 --> 01:04:53,265
And remember,

1785
01:04:53,265 --> 01:04:54,366
always be true to yourself.

1786
01:04:54,366 --> 01:04:57,069
In your thoughts, in your words and in everything that you do.

1787
01:04:57,069 --> 01:04:58,270
All heart, always and in all ways.

1788
01:04:58,304 --> 01:04:59,605
Flushes, flushes, flushes.

1789
01:04:59,605 --> 01:05:01,307
Can I get an eme up in here?

1790
01:05:01,307 --> 01:05:03,409
- Eme!
- Eme!

1791
01:05:03,409 --> 01:05:04,810
Now let the music play!

1792
01:05:04,810 --> 01:05:06,512
Party! Party!

1793
01:05:18,490 --> 01:05:21,093
Next on Drag Race Philippines: Slaysian Royale.

1794
01:05:21,327 --> 01:05:23,228
Get ready to be crazy!

1795
01:05:23,228 --> 01:05:24,930
Because tomorrow, you'll be starring

1796
01:05:24,930 --> 01:05:27,533
in a Rusical production entitled,

1797
01:05:27,533 --> 01:05:30,703
“Crazy Bitch Slaysians”

1798
01:05:31,003 --> 01:05:33,105
It's a Rusical!

1799
01:05:33,138 --> 01:05:34,606
So let's sing,

1800
01:05:34,606 --> 01:05:36,875
and dance it out, baby.

1801
01:05:36,942 --> 01:05:38,577
I'll do Tammy then, I guess.

1802
01:05:38,577 --> 01:05:39,578
I'll do Tammy.

1803
01:05:40,079 --> 01:05:41,146
I'm gonna vote for her.

1804
01:05:41,180 --> 01:05:41,513
- Okay.
- Yuhua.

1805
01:05:41,513 --> 01:05:42,514
- Okay.
- Yuhua.

1806
01:05:42,514 --> 01:05:42,581
- Okay.
- Yuhua.

1807
01:05:42,581 --> 01:05:43,983
- Me too, it's Yuhua.
- Yuhua.

1808
01:05:44,416 --> 01:05:45,050
Wait.

1809
01:05:45,050 --> 01:05:45,184
I was the one you voted out?

1810
01:05:45,184 --> 01:05:46,385
So you wanna play this game?

1811
01:05:46,585 --> 01:05:48,554
So you're all playing sister sister, huh?
