1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:09,050

2
00:00:10,572 --> 00:00:15,830

3
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:28,990
 I think I'm in big trouble.

4
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:30,160
I'm 8 years old.

5
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,130
 What should I do now?

6
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:45,220
When will your class be over today?

7
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:47,045
I'm done with my classes.

8
00:00:47,045 --> 00:00:49,869
Do you want to grab a beer with me tonight?

9
00:00:49,869 --> 00:00:52,089
I'll be free in 30 minutes.

10
00:00:52,089 --> 00:00:53,800
I have to go to my part-time job today.

11
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,180
When is it?

12
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:56,646
In about 3 hours.

13
00:00:56,646 --> 00:00:59,131
Why don't you have a drink before you go?

14
00:01:00,316 --> 00:01:02,391
Will you work after drinking?

15
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,245
Part-time worker?

16
00:01:05,245 --> 00:01:08,501
Why are you meddling in our business?

17
00:01:08,501 --> 00:01:11,544
I'm working with her. That's why I meddled.

18
00:01:11,544 --> 00:01:13,610
How long has it been since you started working with her?

19
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:15,808
I've been her best friend for 2 years!

20
00:01:15,808 --> 00:01:17,905
- Are you my best friend? 
 - Sure!

21
00:01:17,905 --> 00:01:20,140
The length of time doesn't matter when it comes to a relationship between two people.

22
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:23,602
How well do they understand each other? That matters more.

23
00:01:23,602 --> 00:01:25,000
People?

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,260
So how close are you to Yeon Ah?

25
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:31,880
- She farted in front of me! 
 - Hey!

26
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:34,495
I live withâ€“

27
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,400
Live, what?

28
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,210
Live, what?

29
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:41,605
Ah...

30
00:01:41,605 --> 00:01:44,390
We...

31
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,785
bought pork belly meat together! 
  (T/N: In Korean, "live" and "buy" start with the same letter.)

32
00:01:47,785 --> 00:01:50,355
We ate pork belly meat together.

33
00:01:50,355 --> 00:01:52,340
Did you eat that together?

34
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:54,960
Does that mean you drank with him?

35
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:59,320
I should get going now.

36
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,125
Hey!

37
00:02:02,125 --> 00:02:04,320
What's wrong with him?

38
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,645
Stop being friends with him.

39
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:12,211
Anyway, let's grab a beer together.

40
00:02:13,885 --> 00:02:15,324
Oh?

41
00:02:15,324 --> 00:02:17,746
Oh Yeon Ah, answer me.

42
00:02:17,746 --> 00:02:19,611
Oh, sorry.

43
00:02:19,611 --> 00:02:22,064
Maybe next time. Next time.

44
00:02:22,064 --> 00:02:23,970
Oh Yeon Ah!

45
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:33,135
Emptiness, sympathy, sadness, anger, joy,

46
00:02:33,135 --> 00:02:35,640
desire, infatuation.

47
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,570
 I should get going.

48
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,595
What's this emotion?

49
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,600
You shouldn't have said we live together.

50
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,935
Why are you here?

51
00:02:50,935 --> 00:02:52,695
I thought you were going to drink with that guy.

52
00:02:52,695 --> 00:02:55,125
After drinking, work while being tipsy.

53
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:56,383
Are you being sarcastic?

54
00:02:56,383 --> 00:02:58,578
What's so wrong with saying that we live together?

55
00:02:58,578 --> 00:02:59,828
Do I embarrass you?

56
00:02:59,828 --> 00:03:02,858
No, I'm not embarrassed.

57
00:03:02,858 --> 00:03:06,456
But it will bother us a lot if we say that we live together.

58
00:03:06,456 --> 00:03:10,080
B-Bothering. It becomes bothersome?

59
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,420
Do you think I'm bothering you?

60
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:14,190
Why are you so angry?

61
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:17,370
It's not your business who I drink with.

62
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,440
Are you jealous?

63
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,543
Jealous?

64
00:03:23,543 --> 00:03:24,955
I don't do such things!

65
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:27,265
What? Am I jealous? Me?

66
00:03:27,265 --> 00:03:29,456
Of you?

67
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:34,075
Why are you so angry?

68
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,235
We're still getting ready to open this place.

69
00:03:51,235 --> 00:03:53,786
Will you please wait a bit?

70
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,000
Goblin Queen?

71
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,660
Goblin Queen?

72
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:01,578
That lady?

73
00:04:01,578 --> 00:04:03,145
Yes.

74
00:04:04,865 --> 00:04:06,357
What brought you here?

75
00:04:06,357 --> 00:04:08,527
I'm here to see how you're doing.

76
00:04:08,527 --> 00:04:11,287
Managing goblins is my job.

77
00:04:11,287 --> 00:04:12,765
But you...

78
00:04:12,765 --> 00:04:15,375
You know us. Right?

79
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,505
Are there any inconveniences in your life?

80
00:04:22,505 --> 00:04:24,765
Nothing.

81
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:28,620
What's your name?

82
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:31,145
Yeon Ah.

83
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:33,040
Oh Yeon Ah.

84
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,590
Oh Yeon Ah...

85
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:37,262
Are you dating someone?

86
00:04:37,262 --> 00:04:38,825
No.

87
00:04:38,825 --> 00:04:40,391
Anyone you're interested in?

88
00:04:40,391 --> 00:04:41,858
Sorry?

89
00:04:47,895 --> 00:04:49,360
No.

90
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,775
Why do you ask that?

91
00:04:50,775 --> 00:04:52,962
No reason.

92
00:04:52,962 --> 00:04:55,800
I texted you about the next target.

93
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:58,970

94
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:01,935
 She will come to this place tonight.

95
00:05:03,035 --> 00:05:06,170
I should get going since I've seen how you're doing.

96
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,780
Please take good care of Ban Sook.

97
00:05:20,055 --> 00:05:22,935
 If you like someone, it's so obvious.

98
00:05:22,935 --> 00:05:24,575
 You may deny it.

99
00:05:24,575 --> 00:05:27,380
 But you always look at that person.

100
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:31,455
But it's so obvious that

101
00:05:31,455 --> 00:05:34,734
the person I like doesn't like me back.

102
00:05:34,734 --> 00:05:38,080
The person doesn't look at me as much as I look at her.

103
00:05:40,325 --> 00:05:41,725
 Oh?

104
00:05:41,725 --> 00:05:44,356
 Oh Yeon Ah, answer me.

105
00:05:44,356 --> 00:05:46,027
 Oh, sorry.

106
00:05:46,027 --> 00:05:47,909
 Maybe, next time. Next time.

107
00:05:47,909 --> 00:05:50,006
 Oh Yeon Ah!

108
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:55,440
Were you dumped?

109
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,475
No, not dumped.

110
00:05:58,475 --> 00:06:00,265
But there's no hope.

111
00:06:00,265 --> 00:06:02,385
Did you see that guy who looks like a girl?

112
00:06:02,385 --> 00:06:05,265
Did you see the guy that she's flirting with?

113
00:06:05,265 --> 00:06:06,905
Guys always say this.

114
00:06:06,905 --> 00:06:09,530
That a guy looks like a girl when he's handsome.

115
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:12,535
Girls have no eyes for guys.

116
00:06:12,535 --> 00:06:14,700
He looks like someone who will betray a girl.

117
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:15,835
Too girlish.

118
00:06:15,835 --> 00:06:18,150
I bet he's very handsome.

119
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:23,290
So, will you give up?

120
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:25,340
I don't know.

121
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,320
Call her again later.

122
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:32,290
Have a drink and set the mood.

123
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:34,788
I'll be away.

124
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,700
Why? What?

125
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,415
The shower curtain moved by itself.

126
00:07:31,415 --> 00:07:32,965
I didn't touch it.

127
00:07:32,965 --> 00:07:34,992
But it moved like...

128
00:07:34,992 --> 00:07:36,037
Oh...

129
00:07:36,037 --> 00:07:40,320

130
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,395
Why did I....

131
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:45,941
You know, the wind.

132
00:07:45,941 --> 00:07:48,880
When the wind blows, the curtain moves.

133
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,291
It's the wind. Wind.

134
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:52,610
Oh, I'm scared.

135
00:08:31,085 --> 00:08:34,045
Thank you. I'm okay now.

136
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:39,295
Don't look at me like that.

137
00:08:39,295 --> 00:08:40,780
Why?

138
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:44,468
Don't look at me just like when you try to seduce other girls!

139
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,300
Seduce?

140
00:08:48,515 --> 00:08:49,820
Good for you.

141
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:52,260
You can go around kissing many girls.

142
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:54,063
It's not good.

143
00:08:55,755 --> 00:08:57,250
Is not good?

144
00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:01,260
Don't you feel anything when you kiss a girl?

145
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,720
No. I don't have any feelings.

146
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,560
I do that because I have to.

147
00:09:14,196 --> 00:09:16,276
What about me?

148
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:20,965
Don't you feel anything with me?

149
00:09:23,355 --> 00:09:25,445
I don't know such things.

150
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:30,055
What about now?

151
00:09:30,055 --> 00:09:32,140
At this close distance?

152
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:34,560
Don't you feel anything?

153
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,848
Nothing.

154
00:09:35,848 --> 00:09:38,088
Nothing. Nothing at all.

155
00:09:38,088 --> 00:09:39,403
If you can't feel anything about me,

156
00:09:39,403 --> 00:09:41,323
why did you come into my life and made me confused?

157
00:09:41,323 --> 00:09:44,278
You, silly goblin!

158
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,000

159
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:56,200
Oh...

160
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,420
Do you want to have a drink now?

161
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,155
All right.

162
00:10:05,155 --> 00:10:07,819
Let's drink together. I'll be there soon.

163
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:17,980

164
00:10:26,253 --> 00:10:32,350
