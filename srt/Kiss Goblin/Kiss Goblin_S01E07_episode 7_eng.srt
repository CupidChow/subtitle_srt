1
00:00:08,224 --> 00:00:12,865

2
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:23,280

3
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:27,670

4
00:00:30,729 --> 00:00:33,406
What was the 7th emotion?

5
00:00:33,406 --> 00:00:35,313
I'm not sure.

6
00:00:35,313 --> 00:00:37,440
I don't feel anything.

7
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,361
What's that?

8
00:00:41,935 --> 00:00:46,775
What do you want to do first when you become human?

9
00:00:46,775 --> 00:00:49,306
First...

10
00:01:00,944 --> 00:01:03,574

11
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,420
Stay still. It's dangerous.

12
00:01:19,857 --> 00:01:21,997
Is he gone?

13
00:01:21,997 --> 00:01:24,597
No, he isn't.

14
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:33,096
The first thing I want to do when I become human...

15
00:01:33,096 --> 00:01:35,907
is to be friends with you, Yeon Ah.

16
00:01:35,907 --> 00:01:38,250
Formally.

17
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:42,972
Oh... Friends...

18
00:01:52,839 --> 00:01:56,071
- Oh Yeon Ah, did you stay up all night? 
 - Yes.

19
00:01:56,071 --> 00:01:58,178
- But you're almost finished with your assignments. 
 - Yes.

20
00:01:58,178 --> 00:01:59,867
- So why did you stay up? 
 - Yes.

21
00:01:59,867 --> 00:02:02,106
- Are you crazy? 
 - Yes.

22
00:02:05,816 --> 00:02:07,787
This is seriously driving me crazy.

23
00:02:07,787 --> 00:02:10,871
I'm a disgusting, horrible person.

24
00:02:12,394 --> 00:02:14,491
What's with her?

25
00:02:14,491 --> 00:02:18,369
 The reason that I started to lose sleep

26
00:02:18,369 --> 00:02:20,914
 is because of a goblin.

27
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:25,120
 The problem is that this goblin

28
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,960
 is sexy.

29
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,980
You're up early. I was going to wake you up when I'm done.

30
00:02:41,671 --> 00:02:43,404
What are you doing this early?

31
00:02:43,404 --> 00:02:46,325
You have class in the 1st period today. You should have breakfast before you go.

32
00:02:46,325 --> 00:02:48,314
Do you know my class schedule?

33
00:02:48,314 --> 00:02:51,199
1st-period classes on Mondays and Wednesdays; 2nd-period classes on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

34
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:53,420
And you have an afternoon class on Fridays.

35
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,980
- Eat some. 
 - Yes.

36
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,420
Wow, it's delicious.

37
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,040
Is it good?

38
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,119
I didn't add any artificial seasoning.

39
00:03:10,119 --> 00:03:13,411
They say it's healthier that way.

40
00:03:13,411 --> 00:03:15,280
You already mastered housekeeping?

41
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,860
Yes, it's delicious.

42
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:21,640
Oh! You like ketchup with this. Don't you?

43
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:33,020
Look at that.

44
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,140
What shampoo did you use?

45
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,280
I used soap.

46
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,940
 He's so handsome.

47
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:51,280
I think we need to set some rules.

48
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,055
What rules?

49
00:04:53,055 --> 00:04:54,640
Rules for shared living.

50
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,880
We shouldn't inconvenience each other while living together.

51
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,780
Are you inconvenienced?

52
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:04,131
No. I mean, you're still a man even if you're a goblin.

53
00:05:04,131 --> 00:05:05,685
Do you think it's appropriate for you

54
00:05:05,685 --> 00:05:08,387
to walk around the house wearing a T-shirt,

55
00:05:08,387 --> 00:05:11,080
exposing your arms and legs?

56
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,902
What else?

57
00:05:12,902 --> 00:05:16,089
We'll make an exception when you're on a mission because there's no other option.

58
00:05:16,089 --> 00:05:20,571
But don't you think we should maintain about 1-meter distance?

59
00:05:20,571 --> 00:05:25,457
It could make us uncomfortable when we accidentally touch each other.

60
00:05:27,873 --> 00:05:30,667
Fine. Then I'll make a suggestion, too.

61
00:05:30,667 --> 00:05:31,829
Why?

62
00:05:31,829 --> 00:05:35,135
Because I'm paying the rent and doing housework.

63
00:05:35,135 --> 00:05:37,880
I should get a say in this, too.

64
00:05:38,578 --> 00:05:41,720
All right. Let's hear it.

65
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,920
Your hair! Your hair is everywhere. No matter how much I clean, there's still traces of your hair.

66
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,337
Please pick up your own hair.

67
00:05:46,337 --> 00:05:48,877
And you know, you could also help me when I fold the laundry.

68
00:05:48,877 --> 00:05:52,200
Yes, I did say I would do everything.

69
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,200
But do you realize how exhausting housework is?

70
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:59,880
Is it that hard to do the dishes once in a while?

71
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,760
Hey! Do you know how to drink alcohol?

72
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:10,980
This is the first time I saw you drink.

73
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,120
No.

74
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,200
I'm just having a hard time these days.

75
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,240
What is giving you a hard time?

76
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,800
I'm suddenly acquiring all these emotions.

77
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,200
It's confusing.

78
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,620
I was pretending to be cool and strong,

79
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:36,120
but I'd cry or laugh out of nowhere watching TV.

80
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,800
And when I see you, I just...

81
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,040
When you see me?

82
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:46,020
 - Eat some. 
 - Yes.

83
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:51,000
 Mmm! It's so good.

84
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:59,200
 Hey, look at that.

85
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:41,060
 She's pretty.

86
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,740
I just...

87
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:49,100
I just feel...

88
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,560
I get...

89
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:55,520
Emotional.

90
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:59,660
Are you drunk right now?

91
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,640
I just,

92
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:24,540
keep wanting to be nice to you.

93
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:38,700
- Yoon Sul hee. 
 - Yes.

94
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:41,340
I have this friend.

95
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:44,600
She's seeing a guy who's pretty good looking.

96
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,260
Are you talking about yourself?

97
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,080
No, I'm talking about my friend.

98
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,960
Anyway, she doesn't know whether she likes him because he's handsome,

99
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:56,260
or if she likes him as a person.

100
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:59,740
Well... There's a solution for that.

101
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:02,100
I use this method often.

102
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:05,020
Send him a message right now.

103
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:09,000
No... It's my friend...

104
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,200
Is that so?

105
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,240
Anyway. You have to send him a message first.

106
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,860
Then you can find out if you like him or not.

107
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:19,420
How do you know that?

108
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:22,820
Has he seen the message I sent? Has he replied yet?

109
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:25,340
If you find yourself constantly checking your phone.

110
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:29,040
And once he replies, you find yourself agonizing over what to write back.

111
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,440
All day long you're just stuck to your phone because of this.

112
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,740
Then you like him.

113
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,940
You wouldn't care whether someone who you don't like,

114
00:09:37,945 --> 00:09:40,682
writes back or not.

115
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,360

116
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:51,980

117
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:59,940
Well, that was a piece of cake.

118
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,880
Oh? That's the handsome guy that I don't have feelings for.

119
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,420
- Here. 
 - Thank you.

120
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:22,510
My name is Baek Yang.

121
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:23,980
I'm 8 years old.

122
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:33,020
 I think I'm in big trouble.

123
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,800
 What am I going to do?

124
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:48,100
♫  Oh babe nowadays slowly  ♫

125
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,580
♫  Infiltrate me, love is Fallin’  ♫

126
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:53,120

♫  Infiltrate me, love is Fallin’  ♫

127
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:57,220

128
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:59,560
- Did Yeon Ah leave? 
 - Yes.

129
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:02,107
She just left. Didn't you catch her?

130
00:11:02,107 --> 00:11:05,180
I was too busy.

131
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:08,480
It looks like Yeon Ah is going to get a boyfriend soon.

132
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,760
- What? 
 - I think they're still flirting.

133
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:15,520
But you should get the taxi before it's too late.

134
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,980
Or you'll regret it.
