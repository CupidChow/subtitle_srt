1
00:00:06,025 --> 00:00:10,725

2
00:00:10,725 --> 00:00:14,390
According to the rule, exorcists can't kill humans, right?

3
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:16,629
Right, we can't.

4
00:00:17,612 --> 00:00:20,897
I'll torture you just painfully enough so you won't die.

5
00:00:20,897 --> 00:00:22,640
Damn it.

6
00:00:32,155 --> 00:00:33,055
Exactly.

7
00:00:33,441 --> 00:00:34,611
Why did you interrupt me?

8
00:00:35,211 --> 00:00:37,709
Do you regret it?

9
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:48,050

10
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:58,190
Get your hands off her.

11
00:01:01,515 --> 00:01:04,140
Get your hand off!

12
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,960
You... You!

13
00:01:34,419 --> 00:01:36,945
You...

14
00:01:36,945 --> 00:01:40,020
touched the wrong person.

15
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:42,784
Die!

16
00:02:03,662 --> 00:02:06,125
Ban Sook...

17
00:02:06,652 --> 00:02:08,912
Are you okay?

18
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:18,040
Didn't you leave?

19
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:22,080
I was going to.

20
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,280
But I had a question to ask.

21
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:27,040
What is it?

22
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:34,380
If we forget about each other,

23
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:36,720
will we be able to recognize each other?

24
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:42,490
How can we when we've lost our memories?

25
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:47,000
 There's this word in the human world.

26
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,980
 Fate.

27
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,780
If we're destined to be together,

28
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:55,655
wouldn't we be drawn to each other again?

29
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:00,230
So...

30
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:03,900
Do you want to bet our future on fate?

31
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:07,240
If we're meant to be,

32
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,555
then we'll meet again.

33
00:03:09,555 --> 00:03:12,920
If we're meant to be from the beginning,

34
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,725
wouldn't it be okay to leave it to fate?

35
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:23,880
I don't believe in fate.

36
00:03:35,699 --> 00:03:38,059
Do you like me?

37
00:03:39,615 --> 00:03:41,225
Yes.

38
00:03:41,257 --> 00:03:43,741
Ask me the same question.

39
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:47,010
Do you... like me?

40
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:48,670
Yes.

41
00:03:49,865 --> 00:03:54,420
I like the way you are now.

42
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:57,360
I like you making breakfast every morning.

43
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,380
I like you calling my name.

44
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:03,800
I like you who likes me.

45
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:07,240
Not something like fate.

46
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:10,420
I like you the way you are now.

47
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:16,460
Isn't that enough?

48
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:30,880
Let's let the future us take care of our future.

49
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:35,058
For now, I just want us to think about what we want.

50
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,190
I realized the reason why I fell for you.

51
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:42,726
What is it?

52
00:04:42,726 --> 00:04:45,521
You are so cool.

53
00:04:45,521 --> 00:04:47,784
It better be because I'm pretty...

54
00:04:47,784 --> 00:04:50,046
Oh Yeon ah, you are so cool.

55
00:04:50,046 --> 00:04:52,914
I think the future me will fall for you all over again.

56
00:04:52,914 --> 00:04:55,500
I'm confident.

57
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,995
Okay.

58
00:04:56,995 --> 00:05:00,783
That is better than relying on fate.

59
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:19,320
♫  Oh babe nowadays slowly  ♫

60
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:25,520
♫  Infiltrate me, love is Fallin’  ♫

00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,820
♫  Oh babe nothing My babe  ♫

62
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:35,320
♫  My story that I couldn’t tell you  ♫

63
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,820
♫  Oh oh, do you hear me?  ♫

64
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:40,720
♫  Someday yours  ♫

65

67
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:56,480
♫  A lonely song  ♫

68
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:59,110
♫  Faraway black  ♫

69
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:01,960

♫  My time that was lonely  ♫

72

♫  I knew the salvation I was looking for, your kiss  ♫

74
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:20,865

75
00:06:35,505 --> 00:06:37,233
What is this?

76
00:06:37,233 --> 00:06:40,633
- Are you discriminating against me? 
 - No, I'm not.

77
00:06:40,633 --> 00:06:42,803
It's so sweet, babe.

78
00:06:42,803 --> 00:06:44,238
Tell me if you need more, sweetie.

79
00:06:44,238 --> 00:06:45,803
You get an unlimited free refill.

80
00:06:45,803 --> 00:06:48,620
My love is also unlimited!

81
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:49,946
Seriously!

82
00:06:49,946 --> 00:06:53,466
Does your hand hurt? I'll give you a massage.

83
00:06:53,466 --> 00:06:55,850
 My name is Oh Yeon Ah.

84
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:59,690
 I'm an undergraduate living a normal life.

85
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:03,021
Well, I'm going to class.

86
00:07:03,021 --> 00:07:05,325
What class?

87
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:09,040
Yes, it's this one.

88
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,230
Last time I could go, too. Let's go there together.

89
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:13,220
Is that all?

90
00:07:14,603 --> 00:07:17,041
Changjukwan is...

91
00:07:19,025 --> 00:07:20,770
Ah, it's right here!

92
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:22,470

93
00:07:37,965 --> 00:07:42,374
 That was just a normal day, too.

94
00:07:50,295 --> 00:07:53,585
 Not boring; not exciting.

95
00:07:54,365 --> 00:07:58,745
 Little uncertain; little settled.

96
00:07:59,335 --> 00:08:01,810
 A normal day.

97
00:08:02,774 --> 00:08:05,350
This class doesn't have a midterm or final.

98
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:07,800
Your grades will be given 100% by a team project.

99
00:08:09,675 --> 00:08:13,523
I'll randomly divide you into groups of 2.

100
00:08:13,523 --> 00:08:16,100
Check out the board.

101
00:08:25,285 --> 00:08:27,455
Ah! It's here.

102
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:31,080

103
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,040

104
00:08:36,084 --> 00:08:38,768
We're making our own fate.

105
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:42,274
Now the choice is all yours.

106
00:09:00,545 --> 00:09:03,040
 I'm contacting you because of the team project.

107
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,051
 Can I meet you in front of the library?

108
00:09:06,735 --> 00:09:08,985
- Hello? 
 - Ah, yes.

109
00:09:08,985 --> 00:09:11,268
I'm almost there.

110
00:09:11,268 --> 00:09:13,048
Where are you?

111
00:09:13,048 --> 00:09:15,548
 I don't believe in fate.

112
00:09:15,548 --> 00:09:17,479
Ah, I see you.

113
00:09:17,479 --> 00:09:20,745
 But, when I saw him, I thought.

114
00:09:28,315 --> 00:09:32,786
 I'm going to date this person.

115
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:40,625
Are you okay?

116
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:42,870
Ah, yes.

117
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:44,855
Thank you.

118
00:09:45,565 --> 00:09:47,865
Oh Yeon Ah?

119
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:50,370
Yes.

120
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:52,145
And your name is?

121
00:09:52,145 --> 00:09:55,959
Ah, I'm Keon Woo. Kim Keon Woo.

122
00:09:55,959 --> 00:09:57,675
Ah, yes.

123
00:09:57,675 --> 00:09:59,814
Kim Keon Woo.

124
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,660
You are cool.

125
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:05,898
What?

126
00:10:05,898 --> 00:10:08,508
I would've been in big trouble if not for you.

127
00:10:08,508 --> 00:10:10,943
Thank you for saving me.

128
00:10:13,078 --> 00:10:18,325
Have we met before?

129
00:10:19,105 --> 00:10:21,570
I don't know.

130
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:23,965
Maybe.

131
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:28,295
 Like a sunset on the surface of water,

132
00:10:28,965 --> 00:10:33,760
 you approached gently and beautifully.

133
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,465
Should we go?

134
00:10:35,465 --> 00:10:37,524
Should we?

135
00:10:37,524 --> 00:10:39,410
Did you eat something?

136
00:10:40,126 --> 00:10:46,683
 On a normal day with a little uncertainty and a little comfort.

137
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:55,010

138
00:10:55,010 --> 00:11:00,000
 Thank you to our channel manager: 
 ansru

139
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,020
 Thank you to our chief segmenter: 
 SignsofSerendipity

140
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:10,030
 Thank you to our segmenters: 
 miss_rochester and pilar_velasquez

141
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:15,060
 Thank you to our chief editor: 
 lazarini

142
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:20,000
 Thank you to our English editor: 
 cerejacult

143
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,050
 Thank you to our translation editor: 
 mckay_800

144
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:30,000

145
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:35,365

146
00:11:35,365 --> 00:11:38,095
40-10-1

147
00:11:38,749 --> 00:11:40,530
 Cut.

148
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:43,721
Fox ate 100 livers by luring humans...

149
00:11:43,721 --> 00:11:45,106
I really can't hear it.

150
00:11:45,106 --> 00:11:48,026
Why are you laughing?

151
00:11:48,026 --> 00:11:50,305
- Cut. 
 - Ban Sook doesn't look me in the eye.

152
00:11:50,305 --> 00:11:51,810
Cut.

153
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:54,500
Surprised me... I'm sorry.

154
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:57,100

155
00:12:00,161 --> 00:12:03,103
- I'm sorry. 
 - Again.

156
00:12:05,616 --> 00:12:07,661
So sweet.

157
00:12:08,613 --> 00:12:10,360
Then...

158
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,060
I'm sorry. I messed it up. I'll do it again. Sorry.

159
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:14,050
Cut.

160
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,250
Did you see that?

161
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,190
Cut.

162
00:12:35,965 --> 00:12:39,824

163
00:12:39,824 --> 00:12:41,604

164
00:12:41,604 --> 00:12:43,821

165
00:12:43,821 --> 00:12:48,000
