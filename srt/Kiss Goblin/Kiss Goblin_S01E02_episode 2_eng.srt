1
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:14,930

2
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:47,888

3
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,920
Oh, Yeon Ah!

4
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:05,701
It's because of bastards like you that I hate humans.

5
00:01:16,994 --> 00:01:18,833
Why did you hit me?

6
00:01:18,833 --> 00:01:21,027
Is this fun?

7
00:01:21,027 --> 00:01:23,206
Is it fun toying with people?

8
00:01:23,206 --> 00:01:26,912
Do you feel excited and superior when people fall for you?

9
00:01:26,912 --> 00:01:31,152
You probably flirt with people to amuse yourself,

10
00:01:31,152 --> 00:01:34,745
but most people want a serious relationship.

11
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,080
 Look at this.

12
00:01:41,911 --> 00:01:44,870
Because of bastards like you,

13
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,728
do you know how deeply other people get hurt?

14
00:02:03,901 --> 00:02:08,109
 Goblin Queen, I feel strange.

15
00:02:08,109 --> 00:02:10,120
 How do you feel?

16
00:02:10,993 --> 00:02:13,669
 I wanted to wipe her tears.

17
00:02:13,669 --> 00:02:17,895
 I wanted to pat her back.

18
00:02:17,895 --> 00:02:20,311
 The second emotion is compassion.

19
00:02:20,311 --> 00:02:23,548
 It's a feeling that makes you want to comfort someone.

20
00:02:23,548 --> 00:02:26,119
Oh Yeon Ah! What's going on? What's wrong?

21
00:02:26,119 --> 00:02:28,953
He's a two-timing bastard. I saw him with another woman yesterday.

22
00:02:28,953 --> 00:02:30,763
What?

23
00:02:31,948 --> 00:02:34,224
- So? 
 - So?

24
00:02:34,224 --> 00:02:36,877
He's a two-timing bastard!

25
00:02:36,877 --> 00:02:38,407
Did he make a move on you?

26
00:02:38,407 --> 00:02:41,003
You were kissing him.

27
00:02:41,003 --> 00:02:42,968
What are you talking about?

28
00:02:42,968 --> 00:02:46,355
Why would I kiss a stranger?

29
00:02:48,499 --> 00:02:50,232
Well...

30
00:02:50,232 --> 00:02:53,672
You just... Earlier...

31
00:02:53,672 --> 00:02:56,615
Yeon Ah, you need to rest.

32
00:02:56,615 --> 00:02:59,504
Let's go. I'll take you home.

33
00:02:59,504 --> 00:03:02,808
 The world doesn't revolve around me.

34
00:03:02,808 --> 00:03:05,044
 No matter how awful I feel,

35
00:03:05,044 --> 00:03:06,992
 nothing changes.

36
00:03:06,992 --> 00:03:11,030
 One of those things is my assignment.

37
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:15,533
I stayed up all night, but it's still not finished!

38
00:03:18,587 --> 00:03:20,283
 You were kissing him.

39
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:23,191
 Why would I kiss a stranger?

40
00:03:23,191 --> 00:03:27,135
 What game is he playing?

41
00:03:34,525 --> 00:03:35,554
Hello?

42
00:03:35,554 --> 00:03:38,119
 Yeon Ah, you need to start dating.

43
00:03:38,119 --> 00:03:41,572
 I'm saying this for your own good.

44
00:03:41,572 --> 00:03:44,867
Sunbae, why would my dating life concern you?

45
00:03:44,867 --> 00:03:46,553
I'll take care of it.

46
00:03:46,553 --> 00:03:49,038
 Just this once! He's lovesick after seeing your profile picture,

47
00:03:49,038 --> 00:03:52,582
 and he's been refusing to eat for 5 days now.

48
00:03:52,582 --> 00:03:54,622
 Just have a meal with him.

49
00:03:54,622 --> 00:03:58,394
I don't want someone who only wants to meet 
me because of my looks.

50
00:03:58,394 --> 00:04:00,671
I'm having enough trouble doing my assignment.

51
00:04:00,671 --> 00:04:03,833
 Our team project! I'll make the PowerPoint slides.

52
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:05,627
 I'll even do the presentation!

53
00:04:05,627 --> 00:04:10,074
Hey, Sunbae! You said you didn't have time because of your job interview.

54
00:04:10,074 --> 00:04:12,031
 I thought I wouldn't have time, but I'll do it.

55
00:04:12,031 --> 00:04:14,010
 I'll make time.

56
00:04:15,082 --> 00:04:17,277
 Sometimes I wonder.

57
00:04:17,277 --> 00:04:19,343
 Why do people act like this?

58
00:04:19,343 --> 00:04:21,030
 Why aren't you answering?

59
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:23,060
 Will you have lunch with him?

60
00:04:28,364 --> 00:04:31,698
Do I only need to have a meal with him?

61
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:52,350

62
00:04:53,438 --> 00:04:55,199
Are you Oh Yeon Ah?

63
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,816
- Yes, hello. 
 - Hello.

64
00:05:00,676 --> 00:05:02,780
You look different from your picture.

65
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:04,215
Excuse me?

66
00:05:04,215 --> 00:05:06,509
What editing app do you use?

67
00:05:06,509 --> 00:05:08,500
I want to download it.

68
00:05:09,328 --> 00:05:11,728
I pestered Seong Su for 4 nights and 5 days,

69
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:14,060
to set me up with you.

70
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:16,477
You pestered him for 4 nights and 5 days.

71
00:05:16,477 --> 00:05:19,836
It's too bad I don't look good in person.

72
00:05:19,836 --> 00:05:23,280
I was joking. I guess you're the type that holds grudges.

73
00:05:23,899 --> 00:05:25,973
Holds... grudges?

74
00:05:25,973 --> 00:05:29,613
Making jokes is the best way to break the ice. Right?

75
00:05:29,613 --> 00:05:33,513
 People sometimes confuse being rude with being fun-loving.

76
00:05:33,513 --> 00:05:36,140
You're not offended or anything, are you?

77
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:38,105
You're not a square person, are you?

78
00:05:38,105 --> 00:05:40,475
I don't really get along with stern, serious types.

79
00:05:40,475 --> 00:05:44,160
 They think having manners is old-fashioned.

80
00:05:44,775 --> 00:05:48,444
Have you been in a lot of blind dates?

81
00:05:48,444 --> 00:05:51,601
No, this is my first time.

82
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:54,200
Have you been in a lot of relationships?

83
00:05:54,898 --> 00:05:57,000
Is that... what you want to know?

84
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,300
Of course.

85
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:02,441
You could be my future girlfriend. Of course, I want to know.

86
00:06:02,441 --> 00:06:06,879
 Sometimes I wonder why people act like this.

87
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:10,998
 Why aren't they considerate of other people's feelings?

88
00:06:13,636 --> 00:06:17,960
You seem like you've been into a lot of blind dates.

89
00:06:18,815 --> 00:06:21,440
Is it because I'm so smooth?

90
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,731
I went on... a lot of blind dates.

91
00:06:24,731 --> 00:06:26,140
But don't worry.

92
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:28,670
I'm a very devoted boyfriend.

93
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:32,519
You must've been into a lot of blind dates, only.

94
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:35,032
Only going on a lot of blind dates?

95
00:06:35,032 --> 00:06:37,725
That feels like a pinprick comment.

96
00:06:37,725 --> 00:06:39,975
Oh, so you're not totally clueless.

97
00:06:39,975 --> 00:06:45,450
I want to stitch up your mouth with those pins.

98
00:06:46,965 --> 00:06:49,533
I'm just joking.

99
00:06:51,386 --> 00:06:54,081
I'm punching in.

100
00:06:59,568 --> 00:07:01,298
What is going on?

101
00:07:15,069 --> 00:07:17,308
Hey, two-timer! What're you doing here?

102
00:07:17,308 --> 00:07:18,787
I'm a part-time worker here.

103
00:07:18,787 --> 00:07:21,087
Did you come to get back at me for hitting you, right?

104
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:24,001
No, my water got shut off.

105
00:07:24,001 --> 00:07:26,028
I'm not finished talking with you!

106
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:28,059
Talk, then.

107
00:07:28,805 --> 00:07:33,894
You! Why can't Sul Hee remember kissing you?

108
00:07:37,228 --> 00:07:41,178
I'm not "you" or "hey." I'm Ban Sook.

109
00:07:41,178 --> 00:07:43,293
Call me Ban Sook from now on.

110
00:07:43,293 --> 00:07:45,832
And I have my reasons.

111
00:07:45,832 --> 00:07:48,180
So mind your own business.

112
00:07:52,926 --> 00:07:54,651
Do you have your reasons?

113
00:07:54,651 --> 00:07:56,680
It's my friend we're talking about. Do you want me to mind my own business?

114
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,478
Why are you scowling?

115
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,270
And what's wrong with your name?

116
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:03,170
Are you an egg or something? 
  (T/N: Ban Sook means soft boiled in Korean.)

117
00:08:06,438 --> 00:08:10,057
So what are your reasons? Let's hear them.

118
00:08:17,109 --> 00:08:19,179
I'll tell you.

119
00:08:25,236 --> 00:08:28,790
I'm actually a goblin.

120
00:08:29,758 --> 00:08:31,549
To become human,

121
00:08:31,549 --> 00:08:34,731
I need to kiss 10 human beings.

122
00:08:34,731 --> 00:08:36,713
After they kiss me,

123
00:08:36,713 --> 00:08:39,936
everything about me will be erased from their memory

124
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:42,465
to protect those humans.

125
00:08:46,782 --> 00:08:48,579
A goblin?

126
00:08:51,378 --> 00:08:53,544
What a nutcase...

127
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:04,205
What kind of nonsense is that?

128
00:09:04,205 --> 00:09:06,950
We don't allow outside food in our restaurant.

129
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:08,638
I'll store your chicken somewhere else.

130
00:09:08,638 --> 00:09:12,367
Why is this place the only restaurant that doesn't allow outside food?  Huh?

131
00:09:12,367 --> 00:09:14,680
Is this how you run your business?

132
00:09:15,724 --> 00:09:18,492
Every business has its own policies.

133
00:09:18,492 --> 00:09:22,179
But, usually, restaurants don't allow it...

134
00:09:22,179 --> 00:09:24,195
Oh, we almost made a huge mistake.

135
00:09:24,195 --> 00:09:25,617
We almost made a huge mistake.

136
00:09:25,617 --> 00:09:27,307
I'm sorry! I apologize!

137
00:09:27,307 --> 00:09:31,559
Don't bother storing it. You can have all of it, okay?

138
00:09:34,479 --> 00:09:36,633
You crazy...

139
00:09:36,633 --> 00:09:39,356
What? Crazy?

140
00:09:57,008 --> 00:09:58,656
Hey, you jerks!

141
00:09:58,656 --> 00:10:02,279
Why did you get fried chicken delivered to a restaurant?

142
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:04,590
Why did you grab me? Come on!

143
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:06,530
Go! Go! Go!

144
00:10:21,974 --> 00:10:24,876
These last two days have been horrible.

145
00:10:32,301 --> 00:10:35,158
 The second emotion is compassion.

146
00:10:35,158 --> 00:10:38,813
 It makes you want to comfort someone.

147
00:10:45,942 --> 00:10:49,794
What are you looking at?

148
00:10:49,794 --> 00:10:52,717
Are you happy to see me so bent out of shape?

149
00:10:52,717 --> 00:10:54,580
You didn't do anything wrong.

150
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:57,040
They're the ones at fault.

151
00:10:57,871 --> 00:11:01,091
So don't hunch over. Sit up straight.

152
00:11:13,178 --> 00:11:17,312
And I looked up how to comfort people.

153
00:11:17,312 --> 00:11:20,736
Apparently, people feel comforted when they're given chocolate milk.

154
00:11:23,748 --> 00:11:26,280
 Sometimes I wonder.

155
00:11:27,038 --> 00:11:29,833
 Why do people act the way they do?

156
00:11:30,996 --> 00:11:32,984
 All it takes,

157
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:37,165
 is a little bit of thoughtfulness.

158
00:11:45,216 --> 00:11:49,545

159
00:11:49,545 --> 00:11:50,533

160
00:11:50,533 --> 00:11:52,953

161
00:11:55,953 --> 00:12:05,040
