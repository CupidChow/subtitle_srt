1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:08,020

2
00:00:09,225 --> 00:00:12,960

3
00:00:14,715 --> 00:00:17,736
Yeon Ah, I...

4
00:00:19,136 --> 00:00:21,756
I'm going to get a taxi now.

5
00:00:23,049 --> 00:00:25,220
It's hard to get a taxi around here.

6
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:27,656
I'm not talking about that kind of taxi.

7
00:00:27,656 --> 00:00:29,786
Then what?

8
00:00:29,786 --> 00:00:31,493
Yeon Ah.

9
00:00:32,781 --> 00:00:34,380
I...

10
00:00:40,223 --> 00:00:41,965
Lend me some money.

11
00:00:41,965 --> 00:00:43,090
What?

12
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:45,560
I don't have money for a taxi.

13
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:49,800
Hey! Just walk. It's only a 10-minute walk from here. Why do you need a taxi?

14
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,560
Don't you know it's late? It could be dangerous.

15
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:55,300
The street light in front of my house is broken, so it's dark.

16
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,660
I filed a complaint, but they won't fix it.

17
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:59,094
Ji Seung Heon.

18
00:00:59,094 --> 00:01:01,117
Don't you ever try to take me home again.

19
00:01:01,117 --> 00:01:03,937
What kind of gangster are you?

20
00:01:03,937 --> 00:01:05,620
It's only going to cost a minimum fare.

21
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:07,990
You're being really cheap.

22
00:01:10,664 --> 00:01:12,339
Here.

23
00:01:12,339 --> 00:01:15,138
Go, go now.

24
00:01:18,761 --> 00:01:20,709
What's wrong with him?

25
00:01:20,709 --> 00:01:22,700
Has he gone crazy?

26
00:01:25,891 --> 00:01:28,991
 What are you doing Yeon Ah?

27
00:01:35,583 --> 00:01:39,524
 Good morning! When are you available between classes today?

28
00:01:44,265 --> 00:01:47,160
 Do you want to go for a drink tomorrow evening?

29
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,873
 I don't really drink alcohol...

30
00:01:48,873 --> 00:01:53,300
 I'm sorry. I don't think that you're the right person for me.

31
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:55,520
 We can work on our relationship.

32
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,660
 I was a sharpshooter in the military.  
  (T/N: It's a Korean wordplay)

33
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:03,592
 Are you asleep? What are you doing now? Are you outside?

34
00:02:03,592 --> 00:02:05,580
 What are you doing, Yeon Ah?

35
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:08,120
 I'm sorry. Please. I would prefer it if you don't contact me again.

36
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,584
 I hope you meet someone nice.

37
00:02:09,584 --> 00:02:14,100
 Let's see each other one more time! Just once! What do you say?

38
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,780
Wow, how resilient.

39
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:18,720
Why is he being so pushy when I said no?

40
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,847
He's like a bulldozer.

41
00:02:32,337 --> 00:02:35,357
 I'm sending you the 4th person you have to kiss.

42
00:02:35,357 --> 00:02:38,253
 Jeong Eunjeong. 27 years old.

43
00:02:38,253 --> 00:02:41,018
 A graduate student in Seorin University.

44
00:02:46,795 --> 00:02:48,675
This is so annoying.

45
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:12,833
 This is going to be a problem.

46
00:03:13,863 --> 00:03:16,743
Yeon Ah, I've been waiting for quite a while.

47
00:03:18,339 --> 00:03:20,999
Why were you waiting for me?

48
00:03:20,999 --> 00:03:23,050
I sent you messages, but you didn't reply.

49
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:25,220
So I wanted to ask you in person.

50
00:03:26,179 --> 00:03:29,080
Maybe there's a reason I didn't reply.

51
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,265
I made myself clear.

52
00:03:31,265 --> 00:03:34,165
I asked you not to contact me again.

53
00:03:36,932 --> 00:03:40,737
I was really rude to you, wasn't I?

54
00:03:40,737 --> 00:03:42,167
What?

55
00:03:42,167 --> 00:03:45,500
I'm sorry. I like you.

56
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:49,040
But I don't know how to express my feelings...

57
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,300
I'm usually very shy.

58
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,830
But I was trying to overcome that.

59
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:57,518
Maybe that came across as rude and full of bravado.

60
00:03:59,555 --> 00:04:01,580
I see...

61
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:03,600
I'm sorry.

62
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,960
But can you give me another chance?

63
00:04:07,865 --> 00:04:11,860
If you still don't think I'm the right person after that, I won't bother you again.

64
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:15,440
I'd like to be sincere with you this time.

65
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:22,155
Well, then what about this evening?

66
00:04:22,155 --> 00:04:25,100
This evening? Great. I'd love that.

67
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,645
Thank you.

68
00:04:26,645 --> 00:04:29,380
I'll be in touch. Thank you!

69
00:04:30,397 --> 00:04:33,030
 Some problems are like cleaning your room.

70
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:35,920
 You just have to suck it up and deal with it.

71
00:04:43,725 --> 00:04:45,385
 But...

72
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:47,270
Hey, did that work on Oh Yeon Ah?

73
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:50,396
 When you find yourself in a situation you can't handle on your own,

74
00:04:50,396 --> 00:04:51,519
 what are you supposed to do?

75
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:54,334
She's been acting so stuck up but as soon as I was a little bit nice to her,

76
00:04:54,334 --> 00:04:57,014
she fell for it instantly.

77
00:04:57,014 --> 00:04:58,980
I owe it all to you. Because of you, I overcame.

78
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:02,690
She really goes for guys who have good manners.

79
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:07,430
Back in the day, when I was trying to go out with her, I pretended to be a gentleman too.

80
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:08,831
Thank you so much.

81
00:05:08,831 --> 00:05:12,566
Your tactics totally worked on Oh Yeon Ah.

82
00:05:12,566 --> 00:05:13,778
Enough of that.

83
00:05:13,778 --> 00:05:15,360
You need to feed Oh Yeon Ah a lot of alcohol today.

84
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,770
Alcohol? But she said she doesn't drink alcohol.

85
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:20,640
Of course that's a lie.

86
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,377
She's a heavy drinker.

87
00:05:22,377 --> 00:05:25,340
If you talk her into drinking one glass,

88
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:27,920
then she's going to keep drinking all by herself.

89
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,145
And she's going to get drunk and fall asleep. Do you get what I'm saying?

90
00:05:30,145 --> 00:05:32,315
I know what you mean.

91
00:05:32,315 --> 00:05:35,011
Oh, right.

92
00:05:35,011 --> 00:05:37,513
She also has a great figure.

93
00:05:38,467 --> 00:05:40,717
Oh my god. Seriously.

94
00:05:40,717 --> 00:05:43,482
Oh, Yeon Ah is totally my type.

95
00:05:43,482 --> 00:05:44,847
Thank you.

96
00:05:44,847 --> 00:05:47,957
What about that girl that I asked you to introduce me to?  The girl in the Aviation Department?

97
00:05:47,957 --> 00:05:50,360
She's really pretty.

98
00:05:51,224 --> 00:05:53,437
- I... 
 - What?

99
00:06:30,789 --> 00:06:34,699
I'm going to learn your emotion.

100
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:46,516
 The 4th human emotion is anger.

101
00:06:46,516 --> 00:06:50,215
 Anger can make people fail or succeed.

102
00:06:50,215 --> 00:06:53,950
 They say controlling your anger can make or break your life.

103
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:06,678
What's wrong?

104
00:07:09,123 --> 00:07:10,823
Why are you here?

105
00:07:10,823 --> 00:07:12,963
Why are you crying?

106
00:07:14,553 --> 00:07:15,633
It's nothing.

107
00:07:15,633 --> 00:07:19,308
Why are you crying here like an idiot all by yourself?

108
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:23,350
Tell me.

109
00:07:34,377 --> 00:07:39,037
So, I don't know what to do.

110
00:07:44,492 --> 00:07:46,072
Let's go.

111
00:07:46,789 --> 00:07:49,076
Where?

112
00:07:49,076 --> 00:07:51,440
Lead the way to where they are.

113
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:06,140
Lee Woo Hyeon, Kim Jae Woong.

114
00:08:07,889 --> 00:08:08,893
Come outside.

115
00:08:08,893 --> 00:08:10,543
What... Why?

116
00:08:10,543 --> 00:08:12,184
Who are you?

117
00:08:12,184 --> 00:08:14,417
Outside, right now!

118
00:08:18,795 --> 00:08:21,260
Hey, let go. What did we do wrong?

119
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:23,760
I'm going to file a report.

120
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,720
Get your hands off of us!

121
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:28,089
Oh Yeon Ah, is this your boyfriend?

122
00:08:28,089 --> 00:08:31,860
What? Did you ask me out for dinner when you already had a boyfriend?

123
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:34,420
What a piece of trash.

124
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:38,904
Were you like this when you were dating me?

125
00:08:38,904 --> 00:08:40,812
Whoa, is Oh Yeon Ah cheating?

126
00:08:40,812 --> 00:08:42,876
No way.

127
00:08:42,876 --> 00:08:46,096
 When you can't handle it on your own,

128
00:08:46,096 --> 00:08:48,395
 but you have to...

129
00:08:48,395 --> 00:08:50,380
Ban Sook.

130
00:08:52,463 --> 00:08:54,133
Stop.

131
00:08:54,133 --> 00:08:56,778
 It's not my fault.

132
00:08:56,778 --> 00:08:59,792
 But why do I have to handle it by myself?

133
00:09:13,495 --> 00:09:16,970
 - You need to feed Oh Yeon Ah a lot of alcohol today.
 - Alcohol?

134
00:09:17,985 --> 00:09:20,160
 But she said she doesn't drink alcohol.

135
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,962
 Of course that's lie.

136
00:09:21,962 --> 00:09:23,740
 She's a heavy drinker.

137
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:26,640
 If you talk her into drinking one glass,

138
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,325
 then she's going to keep drinking all by herself.

139
00:09:29,325 --> 00:09:31,340
 And she's going to get drunk and fall asleep. Do you get what I'm saying?

140
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:33,740
 I know what you mean.

141
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:37,330
 Oh, right. She also has a great figure.

142
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:39,560
 Oh my god. Seriously.

143
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:42,255
 Oh Yeon Ah is totally my type.

144
00:09:42,255 --> 00:09:44,555
 Thank you so much.

145
00:09:51,249 --> 00:09:54,518
 If I can't handle it by myself,

146
00:09:54,518 --> 00:09:57,425
 I'm not going to handle it by myself anymore.

147
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:04,700
You dirty bastard.

148
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:07,124
Don't ever show your face to me again.

149
00:10:07,124 --> 00:10:10,188
 Because I have people who will unconditionally be on my side.

150
00:10:12,734 --> 00:10:15,441
Hold on. Listen to me.

151
00:10:15,441 --> 00:10:17,567
Hold on.

152
00:10:17,567 --> 00:10:19,760
Wait a minute.

153
00:10:20,874 --> 00:10:24,725
Shouldn't have been me the first to know if you got a new boyfriend?

154
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:27,920
He's not my boyfriend.

155
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,643
He's handsome.

156
00:10:29,643 --> 00:10:31,720
What are you talking about?

157
00:10:35,674 --> 00:10:37,614
Thank you.

158
00:10:38,787 --> 00:10:43,997
How you control anger can be the difference between success and failure.

159
00:10:43,997 --> 00:10:46,550
Now that I've experienced it, I get it.

160
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:47,677
How can you hold it back?

161
00:10:47,677 --> 00:10:50,126
You should just teach them all a lesson.

162
00:10:57,141 --> 00:11:00,391
 So after you're done kissing someone, before the exorcist shows up,

163
00:11:00,391 --> 00:11:02,297
 you need to leave quickly.

164
00:11:02,297 --> 00:11:04,551
Oh, I forgot...

165
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:30,090
♫  Oh babe nowadays slowly  ♫
