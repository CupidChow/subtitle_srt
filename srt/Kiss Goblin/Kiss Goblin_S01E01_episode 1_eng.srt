1
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:14,980

2
00:00:36,917 --> 00:00:38,820
 If a Goblin wants to become a human being,

3
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:43,022
 he must kiss 10 human beings.

4
00:00:44,947 --> 00:00:49,288
 If you learn all 10 emotions, you'll become human.

5
00:00:49,288 --> 00:00:52,729

6
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,120
Give us another glass here!

7
00:00:55,123 --> 00:00:57,900
Yes, just a second!

8
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:00,183
 My name is Oh Yeon Ah.

9
00:01:00,183 --> 00:01:03,314
 A diligent person who aims to have an ordinary life...

10
00:01:03,314 --> 00:01:07,783
Yes, just a moment. Yes, I'll get that for you.

11
00:01:07,783 --> 00:01:10,123
- Hey. 
 - Hey.

12
00:01:10,123 --> 00:01:11,151
- She ignores me. 
 - I guess she can't hear us.

13
00:01:11,151 --> 00:01:12,701
 I'm sick and tired of human beings.

14
00:01:12,701 --> 00:01:14,092
Hey, come here!

15
00:01:14,092 --> 00:01:16,939
 I'm a college student who is sick and tired of people.

16
00:01:16,939 --> 00:01:19,196
Yes, I'll bring it to you.

17
00:01:19,196 --> 00:01:21,150
Yes, will you order please?

18
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:23,570
- Fried potatoes and Soju, please. 
 - Okay.

19
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:26,579
Anything else you need?

20
00:01:26,579 --> 00:01:29,247
Oh, there's one thing.

21
00:01:29,247 --> 00:01:30,992
What is it?

22
00:01:30,992 --> 00:01:34,382
Your number.

23
00:01:37,247 --> 00:01:39,564
- She seems excited. 
 - Right!

24
00:01:39,564 --> 00:01:41,544
Look at her face.

25
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:45,593
Is it fun?

26
00:01:45,593 --> 00:01:47,428
Excuse me?

27
00:01:51,985 --> 00:01:55,278
 When I was young, I used to believe that human nature was fundamentally good.

28
00:01:56,874 --> 00:02:00,490
 But now I am sure

29
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:02,510
 that human nature is fundamentally evil.

30
00:02:03,711 --> 00:02:07,354
 People are evil. Evil.

31
00:02:12,953 --> 00:02:16,933
Boss! Don't you think we need another part-time worker?

32
00:02:16,933 --> 00:02:19,405
I'll take out the trash!

33
00:02:26,704 --> 00:02:30,951
What's wrong with those people. Just get a room.

34
00:02:34,332 --> 00:02:36,863
Oh...

35
00:02:58,632 --> 00:03:02,261
I'll learn one of your emotions.

36
00:03:13,775 --> 00:03:16,537
Where am I?

37
00:03:16,537 --> 00:03:20,414
Oh, I should really quit drinking.

38
00:03:28,635 --> 00:03:30,964
What is this?

39
00:03:30,964 --> 00:03:34,120
 That's a sigh.

40
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,297
What is a sigh?

41
00:03:40,355 --> 00:03:43,942
When you breathe in deeply,

42
00:03:43,942 --> 00:03:46,792
and breathe out.

43
00:03:46,792 --> 00:03:50,847
The emotion that you learned this time is emptiness.

44
00:03:52,644 --> 00:03:54,557
 Emptiness is like a black hole.

45
00:03:54,557 --> 00:03:58,627
 The more you try to fill it, the deeper it becomes.

46
00:03:58,627 --> 00:04:01,209
It feels like I'm empty.

47
00:04:01,209 --> 00:04:04,201
It's empty, but why is it heavy?

48
00:04:04,201 --> 00:04:06,337
This doesn't feel so nice.

49
00:04:06,337 --> 00:04:08,861
But you accomplished the first mission.

50
00:04:08,861 --> 00:04:10,928
Congratulations!

51
00:04:12,653 --> 00:04:16,955
A bear ate mugwort for 100 days to become human.

52
00:04:16,955 --> 00:04:20,028
A fox attracted people and ate 100 human livers.

53
00:04:20,028 --> 00:04:24,600
But you, a goblin, need to kiss 10 people to become human.

54
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,675
Sounds easy, right?

55
00:04:28,248 --> 00:04:31,699
Ten kisses might be easy

56
00:04:31,699 --> 00:04:34,496
because you can use your magical power.

57
00:04:34,496 --> 00:04:39,126
But getting 10 emotions aren't easy.

58
00:04:39,126 --> 00:04:43,533
Emotions are complicated, weird,

59
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,542
and painful.

60
00:04:47,984 --> 00:04:51,502
Despite all this. Do you still want to be human?

61
00:04:53,178 --> 00:04:55,949
Yes, I do.

62
00:04:55,949 --> 00:04:59,833
All right. I'll show you the second target.

63
00:05:13,217 --> 00:05:15,163
Oh, right.

64
00:05:17,172 --> 00:05:19,673
I don't need to use my magical power for such things these days.

65
00:05:19,673 --> 00:05:21,983
This is easier.

66
00:05:23,244 --> 00:05:25,988
Here.

67
00:05:25,988 --> 00:05:28,172
Your second target.

68
00:05:28,172 --> 00:05:30,390
Yoon Sul Hee, 21 years old.

69
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:33,180
Living in the dorm at Seorin University.

70
00:05:36,786 --> 00:05:38,929
Ban Sook.

71
00:05:40,286 --> 00:05:42,636
Yes, Goblin Queen.

72
00:05:42,636 --> 00:05:45,779
Why do you want to be human?

73
00:05:46,657 --> 00:05:48,850
Because I don't want to be alone.

74
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:52,095
You've been alone for over 1,000 years.

75
00:05:52,095 --> 00:05:53,988
I...

76
00:05:55,194 --> 00:05:57,547
I don't want to live like that.

77
00:06:02,277 --> 00:06:04,842
That rude...!

78
00:06:08,872 --> 00:06:10,955
Oh Yeon Ah!

79
00:06:10,955 --> 00:06:13,964
Why do you have a long face? Did anything happen?

80
00:06:13,964 --> 00:06:15,433
Yesterday, my part-time job was difficult.

81
00:06:15,433 --> 00:06:17,394
Didn't you have a fight yesterday?

82
00:06:17,394 --> 00:06:20,216
Hey, there are so many crazy guys.

83
00:06:20,216 --> 00:06:21,927
I guess those crazy ones

84
00:06:21,927 --> 00:06:23,871
will walk around properly, pretending to be normal!

85
00:06:23,871 --> 00:06:25,997
Hey, calm down.

86
00:06:25,997 --> 00:06:28,941
Why are you so angry?

87
00:06:28,941 --> 00:06:30,958
Hatred, go away!

88
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:32,898
Never mind.

89
00:06:32,898 --> 00:06:34,476
Why don't you date someone?

90
00:06:34,476 --> 00:06:39,378
You'll feel stable and the world will look beautiful.

91
00:06:39,378 --> 00:06:41,514
Are you telling me to try dating again?

92
00:06:41,514 --> 00:06:43,793
My ex made me hate people!

93
00:06:43,793 --> 00:06:46,034
You can forget the wrong guy with the right guy.

94
00:06:46,034 --> 00:06:48,866
You have to overcome that hatred towards people.

95
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:52,907
Otherwise, you will have eighth-grade syndrome at your age!

96
00:06:52,907 --> 00:06:54,665
Enjoy dating.

97
00:06:54,665 --> 00:06:57,287
Yes, I will!

98
00:06:57,287 --> 00:07:01,063
Someone asked my number.

99
00:07:01,063 --> 00:07:02,772
Who's he?

100
00:07:02,772 --> 00:07:05,287
I don't know him. I've never seen him around here.

101
00:07:07,453 --> 00:07:09,818
 But he's so handsome.

102
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:23,754
 Excuse me.

103
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:26,655
 Are you Yoon Sul Hee?

104
00:07:26,655 --> 00:07:29,581
 Yes. So?

105
00:07:39,328 --> 00:07:41,567
 Awesome.

106
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:44,974
 He's so gorgeous.

107
00:07:47,021 --> 00:07:51,449
 He has an aura that attracts people.

108
00:07:51,449 --> 00:07:56,553
 When he was just standing there, I thought he was filming a coffee commercial.

109
00:07:58,544 --> 00:08:00,074
I'm curious about him.

110
00:08:00,074 --> 00:08:02,843
I hope you move on from your past relationship.

111
00:08:02,843 --> 00:08:05,499
And meet someone.

112
00:08:05,499 --> 00:08:07,678
I'll take care of it!

113
00:08:07,678 --> 00:08:10,856
I am going to the library. Enjoy dating!

114
00:08:10,856 --> 00:08:13,167
Thank you!

115
00:08:18,256 --> 00:08:21,215
Oh, my.

116
00:08:21,215 --> 00:08:25,157
Is this a place to leave their books?

117
00:09:21,743 --> 00:09:24,451
Stop thinking about it.

118
00:09:33,855 --> 00:09:36,421
Yoon Sul Hee?

119
00:09:36,421 --> 00:09:39,465
Wow, she's moving so fast.

120
00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:00,280
 Where should I buy it.

121
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:11,082

122
00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:19,669
 Look at this.

123
00:10:41,081 --> 00:10:42,766
Oh Yeon Ah!

124
00:10:42,766 --> 00:10:45,321
I've seen you before.

125
00:10:47,235 --> 00:10:49,421
Do you know when I saw him?

126
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:55,717
Because of guys like you, I hate people!

127
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:05,070

128
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,630
♫  In the far black eternity  ♫

129
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:11,160

♫  In the far black eternity  ♫

130
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,310

♫  In the far black eternity  ♫

131
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:14,250
♫  It flows slowly as it stopped  ♫

132
00:11:14,258 --> 00:11:18,253

♫  My time was lonely, I want you  ♫
