1
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:07,040

2
00:00:07,047 --> 00:00:10,357

3
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:14,730
Yeon Ah, we decided to start dating,

4
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:18,100
but that won't be possible if I don't remember you.

5
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:21,660
That's why I decided to just keep liking you.

6
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:26,940
I'll keep remembering and liking you.

7
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,360
You told me

8
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:34,280
that you'll become a human that I'll like.

9
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:38,460
Then the only thing we should do is just like each other.

10
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:40,255
Become human and recognize me.

11
00:00:40,255 --> 00:00:43,445
Be responsible for your words.

12
00:00:43,445 --> 00:00:46,500
The reason why I want to become a human

13
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,360
is that I don't want to be alone.

14
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:54,520
I've stayed alone for 160 years.

15
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:08,350
This is the first time that I like someone.

16
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,335
While liking you...

17
00:01:11,335 --> 00:01:16,980
I get sad, hurt, and angry.

18
00:01:19,285 --> 00:01:21,560
But I've been happy.

19
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:25,835
I've been determined since I realized that I like you,

20
00:01:25,835 --> 00:01:28,460
that I'll never forget this.

21
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:34,420
Even if I remain alone for good,

22
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:37,080
I don't want to forget

23
00:01:37,785 --> 00:01:39,985
all the memories with you.

24
00:01:42,385 --> 00:01:45,040
Because they're so precious.

25
00:01:56,125 --> 00:01:59,005
I'll go home in an hour.

26
00:01:59,545 --> 00:02:01,945
If you're not there, I'll be thinking that you've left.

27
00:02:01,945 --> 00:02:03,740
But...

28
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:07,265
If you keep staying alone and thinking about me forever,

29
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,825
that would make me sad.

30
00:02:33,205 --> 00:02:35,660
 So Ban Sook,

31
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:38,290
 you've succeeded in 4 kisses out of 10,

32
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:41,137
 and there are 6 to go.

33
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:49,100

34
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:53,160

35
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,440

36
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,680

37
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,010

38
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:15,770

39
00:04:53,055 --> 00:04:55,510
Why are you being so clingy?

40
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:58,327
Stop it.

41
00:04:58,327 --> 00:05:01,032
I won't leave you.

42
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,960
Don't leave me.

43
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,000
And just be with me like this.

44
00:05:10,466 --> 00:05:14,279
Okay. Of course.

45
00:05:16,885 --> 00:05:18,785
Ban Sook.

46
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:24,940
Ban Sook?

47
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:30,005
Ban Sook!

48
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:44,160
 Ban Sook has left.

49
00:05:45,355 --> 00:05:47,415
 Okay...

50
00:05:48,961 --> 00:05:51,286
 It was just a fling...

51
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:59,505
 Among a number of flings that I would experience in my life,

52
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:03,790
 this is just one among them.

53
00:06:09,695 --> 00:06:13,300
 I'll be meeting someone better than Ban Sook, right?

54
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:22,960
 Someone like Ban Sook...

55
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:26,100
 Will I be able to meet someone like him?

56
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:41,240
 Ban Sook has left.

57
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:12,050
I didn't order it.

58
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:14,210
It's a gift.

59
00:07:15,794 --> 00:07:18,628
Thank you, but I won't accept it.

60
00:07:18,628 --> 00:07:20,620
Did you get dumped?

61
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:25,855
I told you to stay away from that one.

62
00:07:25,855 --> 00:07:29,485
I knew it. You're not good at sorting out a nice guy.

63
00:07:29,485 --> 00:07:32,685
Even if I'm really bad at sorting out a nice guy,

64
00:07:32,685 --> 00:07:35,089
I would never meet someone like y...

65
00:07:40,675 --> 00:07:45,105
Do you perhaps still...

66
00:07:45,105 --> 00:07:46,625
What?

67
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:48,920
Why are you looking at me with those pitiful eyes?

68
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:52,300
Stop it.

69
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,625
I've already given up on you.

70
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:57,540
You...

71
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:00,580
You haven't been interested in me.

72
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:06,470
I...

73
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,800
I've been determined since I first saw you,

74
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,440
that I would never date you.

75
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,105
Pardon?

76
00:08:14,105 --> 00:08:15,757
Such a decision...

77
00:08:15,757 --> 00:08:17,691
would be opposite normally.

78
00:08:17,691 --> 00:08:19,806
You're a good friend

79
00:08:19,806 --> 00:08:21,486
and a nice person.

80
00:08:21,486 --> 00:08:24,095
So I've decided that I would see you forever.

81
00:08:24,095 --> 00:08:27,000
For that, I would have to stay as a friend of yours.

82
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,280
That was my decision.

83
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:34,554
If we date, then there could be some incidents.

84
00:08:34,554 --> 00:08:37,479
And if we break up, then it would be the end of our relationship.

85
00:08:38,629 --> 00:08:40,240
I don't want to take that risk.

86
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,620
I want to be good friends with you for good.

87
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:46,420
So please remain as my friend forever, Ji Seung Heon!

88
00:08:47,585 --> 00:08:52,300
If we date, we could not have a dispute like this.

89
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:55,810
I'll keep having disputes with you as a friend.

90
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:58,710
Yes, please.

91
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:01,695
You tease and bother me...

92
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:05,210
Please share comforting words when I feel depressed like I do today.

93
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:06,863
I'll do that for you, too.

94
00:09:06,863 --> 00:09:10,258
Okay, I'll give comfort and encouragement on difficult days, and I'll bother you all the time.

95
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:13,561
- Go away! 
 - You go away.

96
00:09:13,561 --> 00:09:14,770
I'm leaving for class.

97
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:18,054
Thank you for the cake. Let's just say I ate it.

98
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:34,850
How...

99
00:09:37,332 --> 00:09:39,775
Have you decided to give it up?

100
00:09:40,769 --> 00:09:42,474
Yes.

101
00:09:43,073 --> 00:09:47,143
It's your decision, no matter what choice you make.

102
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:51,520
Then you're going back to the goblin world,

103
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:54,140
and you'll never be able to come back to the human world.

104
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:56,170
Do you understand?

105
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,350
How was it for you, Goblin Queen?

106
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,720
What?

107
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:09,070
How did you feel when you had to leave someone you loved?

108
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,220
I wanted to commit suicide.

109
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:22,955
It was tough. I regretted it.

110
00:10:23,737 --> 00:10:25,820
If I became human,

111
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:28,360
I wouldn't be in this much pain.

112
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,860
Even if we couldn't recognize each other,

113
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:34,700
we might've encountered and fallen in love with each other by chance.

114
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:39,730
Even if it wasn't in this lifetime. Maybe in my next life.

115
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:42,580
Or the next one.

116
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:47,540
I shouldn't have wanted to become a human,

117
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:51,465
then everything would have been alright.

118
00:10:56,660 --> 00:11:01,835
The chances are that you cannot meet each other even if you become human.

119
00:11:01,835 --> 00:11:05,040
There's no certainty that you would be his lover even if you meet him.

120
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:12,040
There's this word in the human world.

121
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,120
Fate.

122
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:21,110
The goblin you're looking for isn't here.

123
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:23,000
He'll never come back.

124
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:26,578
I can't sleep at night lately, because I'm so ashamed.

125
00:11:26,578 --> 00:11:30,228
When I think of you and that goblin,

126
00:11:30,228 --> 00:11:33,180
I get outraged.

127
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:38,020
I think I would be haunted by this emotion forever if I fail to kill that goblin.

128
00:11:38,684 --> 00:11:40,819
Oh...

129
00:11:40,819 --> 00:11:44,655
You have such high self-esteem.

130
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:48,240
That's why I thought...

131
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,990
If you and that goblin are in that kind of relationship,

132
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:55,620
he would've come when you're in danger.

133
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:59,295
I thought that exorcists weren't allowed to kill humans.

134
00:11:59,295 --> 00:12:01,460
We're not allowed to.

135
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:06,200
I'll torture you just painfully enough so you won't die.

136
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:10,930
Oh no!

137
00:12:29,338 --> 00:12:34,000
