1
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:11,482

2
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:22,970

3
00:00:44,484 --> 00:00:48,471
Female human, stay out of this.

4
00:00:48,471 --> 00:00:50,407
Stop it!

5
00:00:51,292 --> 00:00:54,792
Why do you keep covering for Goblin?

6
00:00:54,792 --> 00:00:57,515
Then, why do you keep trying to kill him?

7
00:00:57,515 --> 00:00:59,991
Killing goblins and protecting humans,

8
00:00:59,991 --> 00:01:02,115
that's my job.

9
00:01:02,115 --> 00:01:04,740
I don't know about other goblins because I haven't met them.

10
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:07,085
But Ban Sook is nothing like that.

11
00:01:07,085 --> 00:01:09,839
Ban Sook helped me today, too.

12
00:01:09,839 --> 00:01:13,980
I was so angry, upset, and frustrated.

13
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:15,480
But Ban Sook helped me out.

14
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,560
So, don't kill him.

15
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,833
Step aside.

16
00:01:18,833 --> 00:01:20,740
I can't kill you, too.

17
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:23,480
Stop it! I'll call the police!

18
00:01:24,025 --> 00:01:25,785
Wait.

19
00:01:25,785 --> 00:01:28,360
You can't kill me, too?

20
00:01:28,957 --> 00:01:31,632
Does that mean you can't kill me?

21
00:01:32,483 --> 00:01:34,798
I can't kill a human even if I want to.

22
00:01:34,798 --> 00:01:37,679
Because I'm an exorcist who protects humans.

23
00:01:37,679 --> 00:01:39,797
So, step aside.

24
00:01:39,797 --> 00:01:42,122
Ah...

25
00:01:47,804 --> 00:01:49,329
I don't want to.

26
00:01:49,329 --> 00:01:52,247
Try me.

27
00:01:52,247 --> 00:01:53,569
Try to kill me!

28
00:01:53,569 --> 00:01:56,183
How can an exorcist kill a human? An exorcist?

29
00:01:56,183 --> 00:01:59,445
Ah, kill me! Try to kill me now!

30
00:01:59,445 --> 00:02:01,665
Ah, kill me! Try!

31
00:02:01,665 --> 00:02:04,905
Kill me! Kill me! Kill me! Try!

32
00:02:04,905 --> 00:02:07,925
Quickly, kill me!

33
00:02:12,252 --> 00:02:16,933
You... I'll see you later.

34
00:02:26,754 --> 00:02:31,014
Are you okay? He really can't touch me.

35
00:02:59,857 --> 00:03:02,049
Protect me.

36
00:03:02,851 --> 00:03:04,529
What?

37
00:03:04,529 --> 00:03:06,344
Me.

38
00:03:06,921 --> 00:03:08,937
Please protect me.

39
00:03:09,741 --> 00:03:14,656
How can I protect you?

40
00:03:15,728 --> 00:03:18,050
Let's live together.

41
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:20,690
Right, okay.

42
00:03:21,191 --> 00:03:22,960
Ah, what?

43
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:31,240
Ban Sook pays 100% of the rental fee to Oh Yeon Ah.

44
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:34,160
Oh Yeon Ah provides Ban Sook a place to live.

45
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:37,130
Ban Sook is in charge of cleaning, laundry, cooking, dishwashing, recycling, and

46
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:39,075
every other house chore.

47
00:03:39,075 --> 00:03:42,269
Oh Yeon Ah protects Ban Sook's life from the exorcist.

48
00:03:42,269 --> 00:03:46,896
Ban Sook obeys Oh Yeon Ah's word.

49
00:03:46,896 --> 00:03:50,170
Oh Yeon Ah supports Ban Sook's

50
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:53,610
project of becoming a human.

51
00:03:55,351 --> 00:04:00,694

52
00:04:00,694 --> 00:04:01,875

53
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:05,935
 100% rent fee, jackpot.

54
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:11,160
Anyway, I hope you stick up to your words.

55
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:14,218

56
00:04:14,218 --> 00:04:16,580
So, until now you

57
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:19,519
have succeeded in 4 out of 10 kisses.

58
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,139
And there are 6 kisses left.

59
00:04:21,139 --> 00:04:24,160
How come you only got bad emotions?

60
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,120
All the feelings that you're feeling are all not good.

61
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,740
When you are on a part-time job, do you know those rude customers?

62
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,700
That's what they feel.

63
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:36,170
As soon as the Goblin Queen points out a person, we'll go right away to kiss that person.

64
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:38,825
I must accompany you.

65
00:04:38,825 --> 00:04:41,649
Or else, you will be...

66
00:04:41,649 --> 00:04:43,475
Killed by the exorcist.

67
00:04:43,475 --> 00:04:46,360
I'm that important. Got it?

68
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:50,940
And we should leave the scene as soon as we're done with the job.

69
00:05:40,226 --> 00:05:43,472

70
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:23,400

71
00:06:23,403 --> 00:06:25,723

72
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,400

73
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:26,890

74
00:07:31,885 --> 00:07:33,925
I've come to pick you up.

75
00:07:35,089 --> 00:07:38,369
Now you know how to smile. You're all grown up.

76
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,060

77
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:58,142

78
00:07:58,872 --> 00:08:00,951
I...

79
00:08:00,951 --> 00:08:03,385
Want to have something...

80
00:08:03,385 --> 00:08:05,286
What is it?

81
00:08:05,286 --> 00:08:07,188
A friend.

82
00:08:07,188 --> 00:08:08,801
What?

83
00:08:08,801 --> 00:08:10,942
Do you want to be friends with me?

84
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:22,800

85
00:08:23,624 --> 00:08:25,672
You...

86
00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:41,942
- What's this? 
 - Snacks?

87
00:08:41,943 --> 00:08:43,660
- No. 
 - It's my favorite.

88
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:45,875
No!

89
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:48,810
Just one...

90
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:51,979
- Let's eat this. 
 - Tomato?

91
00:08:51,979 --> 00:08:53,501
This doesn't look that fresh.

92
00:08:53,501 --> 00:08:56,468
No, it looks really fresh.

93
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,437
 It isn't so bad actually.

94
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:17,420
 The way he takes care of me,

95
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:21,263
 or the way he looks at me.

96
00:09:28,677 --> 00:09:31,877
Your face is somewhat different these days.

97
00:09:31,877 --> 00:09:36,398
I have gained some weight...

98
00:09:37,061 --> 00:09:39,041
Before,

99
00:09:39,657 --> 00:09:41,387
your face was like this most of the time.

100
00:09:41,387 --> 00:09:43,262
But these days,

101
00:09:44,456 --> 00:09:46,236
you're like this.

102
00:09:47,179 --> 00:09:49,404
Was I?

103
00:09:54,365 --> 00:09:57,330
It looks better.

104
00:10:00,654 --> 00:10:03,074
Stop flirting with me.

105
00:10:09,982 --> 00:10:13,516
These days, maybe because I mostly go around with you.

106
00:10:13,516 --> 00:10:16,580
It's probably because I don't really think about people.

107
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:19,065
I hate people.

108
00:10:19,065 --> 00:10:20,435
Why?

109
00:10:20,435 --> 00:10:22,971
When there's an empty seat in a subway,

110
00:10:22,971 --> 00:10:25,871
it's a human who rushes to sit on it.

111
00:10:25,871 --> 00:10:28,308
And you hate it that much?

112
00:10:29,055 --> 00:10:30,935
But the problem is

113
00:10:30,935 --> 00:10:33,820
that behavior applies to every situation.

114
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:37,320
At school, in a café, in a restaurant.

115
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:40,480
People rush in to take their place.

116
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,655
They don't care about how other people feel.

117
00:10:46,265 --> 00:10:49,465
It's suffocating to live with them.

118
00:10:49,465 --> 00:10:52,127
I shouldn't hate them though.

119
00:10:52,127 --> 00:10:54,549
You can hate them.

120
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,860
I'm human, too. How can I hate humans?

121
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:00,440
And you also want to be human.

122
00:11:01,731 --> 00:11:05,741
Then, I will not be the kind of human that you hate.

123
00:11:05,741 --> 00:11:08,179
I will be the human that you like.

124
00:11:08,179 --> 00:11:10,193
Then you can like me.

125
00:11:10,193 --> 00:11:12,613
I can like you.

126
00:11:12,613 --> 00:11:14,995
Isn't that what a friend is?

127
00:11:16,637 --> 00:11:20,877
It would be so nice if you were human.

128
00:11:23,654 --> 00:11:25,691
I like this.

129
00:11:26,492 --> 00:11:29,012
Smiling face.

130
00:11:31,212 --> 00:11:33,957
 Spending time with you

131
00:11:34,721 --> 00:11:37,061
 it's not so bad.

132
00:11:38,374 --> 00:11:40,274
 So,

133
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:48,961
 I'm sad.

134
00:11:51,765 --> 00:11:56,405
 I don't think I can be friends with you...

135
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:04,460
♫  Oh babe nowadays slowly  ♫

136
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:06,670
♫  Infiltrate me, love is Fallin’  ♫

137
00:12:06,678 --> 00:12:11,032

♫  Infiltrate me, love is Fallin’  ♫
