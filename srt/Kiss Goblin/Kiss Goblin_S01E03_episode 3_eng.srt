1
00:00:09,366 --> 00:00:15,636

2
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:30,050

3
00:00:46,628 --> 00:00:47,973
What's going on?

4
00:00:47,973 --> 00:00:51,165
Hey, Ji Seung Heon. Why do I have such a small amount of cream?

5
00:00:51,165 --> 00:00:54,397
You said you're on a diet. I'm being considerate of you.

6
00:00:54,397 --> 00:00:57,449
Really? Thank you!

7
00:00:57,449 --> 00:00:59,346
Thank you!

8
00:00:59,346 --> 00:01:01,593
Yeon Ah, how did your blind date go?

9
00:01:01,593 --> 00:01:04,067
Blind date? Did you have a blind date?

10
00:01:04,067 --> 00:01:05,480
Hey. Why did you shout?

11
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,649
So, what happened?

12
00:01:06,649 --> 00:01:09,335
It didn't go well. I didn't want to do it.

13
00:01:09,335 --> 00:01:11,403
I thought you said you didn't want to be in a relationship.

14
00:01:11,403 --> 00:01:14,963
Why didn't you tell me about going on this blind date?

15
00:01:14,963 --> 00:01:19,046
Whether I want a relationship or not, why do I have to tell you?

16
00:01:19,046 --> 00:01:22,883
Because... you need a relationship guide.

17
00:01:22,883 --> 00:01:25,501
Think about your ex.

18
00:01:25,501 --> 00:01:27,465
Don't bring him up.

19
00:01:27,465 --> 00:01:30,215
You were madly in love and gave him everything.

20
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:33,301
And you couldn't say anything even when he cheated on you.

21
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:36,316
Was that really Oh Yeon Ah? The same person who always punch others first?

22
00:01:36,316 --> 00:01:40,210
In front of him, you were so calm and nice.

23
00:01:41,066 --> 00:01:43,933
- Where are you going? 
 - Class!

24
00:01:45,788 --> 00:01:48,604
If you have a crush on her, you need to be kind.

25
00:01:48,604 --> 00:01:50,987
Why do you always blame and tease her?

26
00:01:50,987 --> 00:01:52,563
What about it?

27
00:01:52,563 --> 00:01:55,168
Oh, this fool.

28
00:02:00,827 --> 00:02:04,566
Do you see that unnie at the desk?

29
00:02:07,426 --> 00:02:11,846
Unnie? Goblin Queen, I think you're much older than her.

30
00:02:11,846 --> 00:02:13,649
Shut up.

31
00:02:15,399 --> 00:02:17,805
She's the 3rd person you need to kiss.

32
00:02:17,805 --> 00:02:23,694
I guess that by now, he would've recognized you.

33
00:02:23,694 --> 00:02:26,870
- Who? 
 - The exorcist.

34
00:02:27,681 --> 00:02:31,040
When you kiss someone, your goblin energy spreads out.

35
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,543
When he senses it, he will come to kill you.

36
00:02:34,543 --> 00:02:38,896
So, if you succeed in a mission, you have to leave 
that place immediately.

37
00:02:38,896 --> 00:02:42,040
Shouldn't I know who he is to avoid him?

38
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,230
How dare...

39
00:02:45,275 --> 00:02:49,096
Never mind. It'll not be easy to handle this emotion.

40
00:02:49,096 --> 00:02:51,614
Be careful.

41
00:03:06,035 --> 00:03:07,885
Is that your husband?

42
00:03:07,885 --> 00:03:10,480
That's my ex.

43
00:03:11,216 --> 00:03:14,450
Why do you have his picture there?

44
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:19,284
He died 2 years ago. It was a car accident.

45
00:03:19,284 --> 00:03:21,860
A week before our wedding.

46
00:03:22,726 --> 00:03:24,488
Oh...

47
00:03:24,488 --> 00:03:26,457
It sounds so sad, right?

48
00:03:26,457 --> 00:03:31,729
But, I try my best to say it as nonchalantly as possible.

49
00:03:31,729 --> 00:03:35,997
Because I want to treat it like it's nothing special.

50
00:03:35,997 --> 00:03:38,522
It's okay.

51
00:03:38,522 --> 00:03:41,063
Actually, I can't forget about him.

52
00:03:41,063 --> 00:03:42,930
It's just that...

53
00:03:43,721 --> 00:03:47,510
When I look at that picture,

54
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:50,810
it feels like he'll open the door and walk into the room.

55
00:03:52,057 --> 00:03:54,338
All right. Done.

56
00:03:54,338 --> 00:03:57,170
Oh, yes. Thank you.

57
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,974
Thank you.

58
00:04:32,367 --> 00:04:34,621
Is it a dream?

59
00:04:34,621 --> 00:04:36,911
I'm really late, right?

60
00:04:38,433 --> 00:04:40,950
You're so late.

61
00:04:41,816 --> 00:04:45,327
Why did it take you 2 years to get here?

62
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:47,152
I'm sorry.

63
00:05:13,549 --> 00:05:16,149
Thank you for coming.

64
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:20,930
Please come to my dream again, just like today.

65
00:05:22,817 --> 00:05:25,370
I'll be in your dream very often from now on.

66
00:05:51,237 --> 00:05:54,630
 This emotion will be hard to handle.

67
00:06:19,663 --> 00:06:22,772
 My ex is here.

68
00:06:24,046 --> 00:06:28,840
 My ex who made my heart race for the first time.

69
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:34,889
 My ex who broke my heart for the first time.

70
00:06:34,889 --> 00:06:37,512
 He's here.

71
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:44,628
Do you know her?

72
00:06:44,628 --> 00:06:47,960
Oh, she's just one of my juniors.

73
00:06:48,853 --> 00:06:50,650
Oh...

74
00:06:51,232 --> 00:06:53,278
We'll be late. Let's go.

75
00:06:53,278 --> 00:06:55,026
OK.

76
00:07:04,669 --> 00:07:07,315
What was I expecting?

77
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:50,750
What's wrong with you?

78
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:53,541
I don't know.

79
00:08:16,512 --> 00:08:18,800
What happened to you?

80
00:08:20,057 --> 00:08:23,170
What made you feel so sad that you were crying?

81
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,064
Because I'm sad?

82
00:08:26,064 --> 00:08:30,413
Weren't you crying because you were sad?

83
00:08:30,413 --> 00:08:32,820
It feels like my heart is breaking.

84
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:35,630
Is it because I'm sad?

85
00:08:37,055 --> 00:08:40,108
Are you pretending to be a goblin again?

86
00:08:40,108 --> 00:08:42,586
What should I do not to feel sad?

87
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:57,569
Well... Is there any way not to feel sad?

88
00:08:57,569 --> 00:09:00,635
I guess everyone's sad.

89
00:09:00,635 --> 00:09:05,627
But they hide it in their own ways.

90
00:09:05,627 --> 00:09:09,580
Isn't it comforting when you think of it that way?

91
00:09:10,224 --> 00:09:14,142
Sorry, that doesn't work.

92
00:09:14,142 --> 00:09:16,720
All right. You need to be sad until you'll feel okay.

93
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,805
There's no solution.

94
00:09:19,805 --> 00:09:22,456
So there's really no answer.

95
00:09:22,456 --> 00:09:25,296
You're not thankful. I even tried to comfort you...

96
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:35,020

97
00:09:36,881 --> 00:09:39,602
You're Ban Sook, right?

98
00:09:39,602 --> 00:09:41,627
Yes. Do I know you?

99
00:09:41,627 --> 00:09:44,096
I could just smell it.

100
00:09:44,096 --> 00:09:46,375
The scent of a goblin.

101
00:09:52,685 --> 00:09:54,735
Exorcist?

102
00:10:03,761 --> 00:10:08,491
