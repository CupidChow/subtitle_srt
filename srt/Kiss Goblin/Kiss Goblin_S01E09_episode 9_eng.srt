1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:06,950

2
00:00:08,225 --> 00:00:10,260

3
00:00:12,051 --> 00:00:13,367
If you feel nothing,

4
00:00:13,367 --> 00:00:15,415
why did you appear in front of me and made me feel confused?

5
00:00:15,415 --> 00:00:18,235
This goblin!

6
00:00:24,562 --> 00:00:26,647

7
00:00:28,215 --> 00:00:29,815
Hello.

8
00:00:29,815 --> 00:00:32,141
Drinking? Right now?

9
00:00:37,627 --> 00:00:41,682
Okay. Let's meet and drink.

10
00:00:55,275 --> 00:00:56,375

11
00:00:56,375 --> 00:00:58,747
 Ninth kiss partner.

12
00:00:58,747 --> 00:01:02,951
 You should accomplish it before 2:00 a.m.

13
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:22,220

14
00:01:32,515 --> 00:01:36,153
 You should accomplish it before 2:00 a.m.

15
00:01:41,612 --> 00:01:47,633

16
00:01:55,675 --> 00:01:59,965
Are you happy?

17
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:28,160
I'll learn your emotion.

18
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,070
 What should we eat?

19
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:04,120
 Are you happy?

20
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:09,905
 I'm happy.

21
00:03:09,905 --> 00:03:12,770
 I'm happy when I'm with that person.

22
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,617
 I want to stay happy.

23
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:22,055

24
00:03:22,055 --> 00:03:23,555
Pardon?

25
00:03:23,555 --> 00:03:26,602
It is something that remains for only a split second.

26
00:03:26,602 --> 00:03:29,119
Its lifespan is...

27
00:03:29,119 --> 00:03:31,229
as short as that of milk.

28
00:03:34,211 --> 00:03:35,976
Why?

29
00:03:35,976 --> 00:03:37,557
You know...

30
00:03:37,557 --> 00:03:40,654
Meet a good person and be happy.

31
00:03:40,654 --> 00:03:43,316
You could feel happy for a moment. I understand!

32
00:03:43,316 --> 00:03:45,775
You'll be so happy.

33
00:03:46,983 --> 00:03:49,480
But...

34
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,180
 One more time. Where did you buy it from?

35
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:53,968
humans don't know how to be satisfied.

36
00:03:53,968 --> 00:03:58,541
We always want to be happier and happier.

37
00:04:00,575 --> 00:04:04,425
Keep this in mind, happiness at the moment equals milk!

38
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,535
So...

39
00:04:07,535 --> 00:04:12,249
We give up before the milk expires.

40
00:04:12,249 --> 00:04:14,690
Before love becomes deeper.

41
00:04:16,435 --> 00:04:18,875
This much is enough. It's okay.

42
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:20,932
That shouldn't go on beyond here.

43
00:04:20,932 --> 00:04:25,291
That's how I protect myself.

44
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:30,558
I...

45
00:04:30,558 --> 00:04:33,558
I can make you stay happy.

46
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:36,255
Pardon?

47
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,585
I...

48
00:04:39,585 --> 00:04:41,609
I can...

49
00:04:42,091 --> 00:04:44,603
I can make you happy.

50
00:04:45,582 --> 00:04:47,927
How?

51
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:51,050
I...

52
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:53,476
I'll keep liking you a lot.

53
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,640
Are you crazy?

54
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,634
I mean it.

55
00:04:58,634 --> 00:05:01,437
I asked you to come here today, so I could confess.

56
00:05:01,437 --> 00:05:03,980
I didn't call you because I was bored.

57
00:05:45,899 --> 00:05:48,646

58
00:05:52,165 --> 00:05:54,090
Sorry, I've to go.

59
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:56,296
Who is it? That part-timer?

60
00:05:56,296 --> 00:05:58,782
Yes, I have to go to him.

61
00:05:58,782 --> 00:06:01,635
Sorry! Let's talk about it next time.

62
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:15,247
Why aren't you answering?

63
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:27,570
For a mere goblin, I've been going around too actively.

64
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:31,705
What do you mean by "a mere goblin"?

65
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,540
A being that has been abandoned by humans.

66
00:06:39,032 --> 00:06:43,017
Stop bringing chaos to the human world.

67
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:56,938
What are you that keeps trying to hurt Ban Sook!

68
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,415
What are you?

69
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:07,430
Hey, Ban Sook!

70
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:11,025
Wake up, Ban Sook! Are you okay?

71
00:07:14,165 --> 00:07:17,339
Blood... What should I do?

72
00:07:17,339 --> 00:07:19,093
What should I do?

73
00:07:19,093 --> 00:07:22,225
Ban Sook. Wake up!

74
00:07:22,225 --> 00:07:24,868
Why are you so late?

75
00:07:24,868 --> 00:07:27,125
I've been waiting for you to come.

76
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:28,975
Sorry.

77
00:07:28,975 --> 00:07:31,413
I promised that I would keep you safe.

78
00:07:31,413 --> 00:07:34,183
Sorry for being late.

79
00:07:37,026 --> 00:07:39,979
Still, I'm happy to see you.

80
00:07:40,899 --> 00:07:43,599
I really missed you.

81
00:07:50,395 --> 00:07:52,620
Ban Sook...

82
00:07:55,119 --> 00:07:57,976
Ban Sook. Wake up!

83
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:01,715
Wake up, Ban Sook, please!

84
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:06,415
No!

85
00:08:06,415 --> 00:08:08,940
We promised to be friends.

86
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:12,517
We haven't become friends yet!

87
00:08:13,365 --> 00:08:15,335
Hey, Ban Sook...

88
00:08:15,335 --> 00:08:18,557
I like you very much.

89
00:08:19,622 --> 00:08:23,723
I really like you!

90
00:08:23,723 --> 00:08:26,137
Please wake up.

91
00:08:26,137 --> 00:08:28,131
I'll do whatever I can.

92
00:08:28,131 --> 00:08:30,854
Please wake up.

93
00:08:30,854 --> 00:08:33,405
Please, Ban Sook.

94
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:48,000
So, were you born again?

95
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:30,395
He's been treated well, so he will get well if he takes some rest.

96
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:33,595
You...

97
00:09:34,505 --> 00:09:38,200
Did you mean it when you said you can do everything for Ban Sook?

98
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,560
Pardon?

99
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:43,528
After the last kiss, Ban Sook will become human.

100
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:46,975
Please take good care of him.

101
00:10:06,015 --> 00:10:09,769
 Ban Sook, I really like you.

102
00:10:09,769 --> 00:10:14,023
 I like you so much!

103
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:43,095
Don't do anything.

104
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,850
Pardon?

105
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,130
Please don't leave me alone.

106
00:10:51,365 --> 00:10:54,105
Don't drink with any other guy.

107
00:10:54,105 --> 00:10:56,517
Don't talk to them either.

108
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:00,390
Don't ignore my calls.

109
00:11:01,695 --> 00:11:04,470
Don't make me feel sad.

110
00:11:07,735 --> 00:11:10,820
Why are there so many "don'ts?"

111
00:11:11,416 --> 00:11:13,504
Instead...

112
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:17,235
I'll continue to like you a lot.

113
00:11:19,305 --> 00:11:21,305
I'll...

114
00:11:22,149 --> 00:11:24,996
really, keep liking you a lot.

115
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:29,575
So please don't do anything.

116
00:11:31,695 --> 00:11:34,440
I like you very much, too.

117
00:11:35,745 --> 00:11:38,645
So don't be hurt because of anything.

118
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:49,950

119
00:11:57,351 --> 00:12:02,000
