1
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:09,990

2
00:00:16,076 --> 00:00:19,495

3
00:01:25,281 --> 00:01:27,946
Wait a moment.

4
00:01:37,965 --> 00:01:39,276
Did you make all this?

5
00:01:39,276 --> 00:01:40,510
Yes.

6
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:43,040
I can't do many things,

7
00:01:43,043 --> 00:01:45,200
but I can make you simple dishes from time to time.

8
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,020
You said housekeeping wasn't easy.

9
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:49,593
This is why...

10
00:01:49,593 --> 00:01:51,690
they risk their lives to become human.

11
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:52,890
Huh?

12
00:01:53,698 --> 00:01:58,620
I mean, I'm happy to be with you like this.

13
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:01,027
Come on.

14
00:02:06,794 --> 00:02:08,296
I'll do it.

15
00:02:08,296 --> 00:02:12,118
Just go get some rest and get well soon.

16
00:02:28,556 --> 00:02:31,397
Just until the last kiss.

17
00:02:32,506 --> 00:02:34,960
I'll be tolerating

18
00:02:34,963 --> 00:02:37,399
the last kiss only.

19
00:02:37,399 --> 00:02:41,902
If you kiss someone else after you become human, you are so dead.

20
00:02:43,834 --> 00:02:47,244
If I become human, the kiss...

21
00:02:48,598 --> 00:02:51,006
should I kiss you only?

22
00:02:51,909 --> 00:02:54,300
Then...

23
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,920
Are we dating?

24
00:02:56,929 --> 00:02:59,448
Not yet!

25
00:02:59,448 --> 00:03:02,443
The day you become human.

26
00:03:02,443 --> 00:03:05,912
That's Day 1.

27
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:09,000
I can't wait.

28
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:14,955
 The more you refuse to accept the feeling of liking someone, the deeper it becomes.

29
00:03:14,955 --> 00:03:19,974
 The moment you accept it, it will grow out of control.

30
00:03:19,974 --> 00:03:22,178
 Like an expanded balloon.

31
00:03:22,178 --> 00:03:24,140

32
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:26,124

33
00:03:26,858 --> 00:03:29,574
 You don't know when it will burst.

34
00:03:31,332 --> 00:03:33,886
I'll go out shortly.

35
00:03:34,838 --> 00:03:37,960
Where are you going? You are still sick.

36
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,839
Don't tell me you are off for another mission alone.

37
00:03:40,839 --> 00:03:44,173
I'm just going to get some Coke at the market.

38
00:03:54,163 --> 00:03:56,723
Why Oh Yeon Ah?

39
00:03:58,948 --> 00:04:01,402
Her main emotion is love.

40
00:04:01,402 --> 00:04:04,730
Which is the last emotion you need.

41
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:06,270
It doesn't have to be her!

42
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:10,133
The last kiss has to be with someone who loves you!

43
00:04:12,423 --> 00:04:15,030
If I kiss Oh Yeon Ah,

44
00:04:15,812 --> 00:04:18,555
she won't remember me.

45
00:04:28,592 --> 00:04:30,510
I told you.

46
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:34,529
Nobody has ever been able to become human.

47
00:04:34,529 --> 00:04:38,876
Many goblins failed to kiss the last person, which was the last mission.

48
00:04:38,876 --> 00:04:43,557
Instead, they chose to keep the memory forever.

49
00:04:44,874 --> 00:04:48,360
Make your decision. You are running out of time.

50
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:52,716
If you give up the mission, you must leave the human world immediately.

51
00:04:59,513 --> 00:05:02,110
 Did you come here to die alone?

52
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:05,158
 I know the person for my last kiss.

53
00:05:05,158 --> 00:05:08,935
 I failed to kill you, nine times.

54
00:05:08,935 --> 00:05:12,126
 I will this time, defiantly.

55
00:05:13,823 --> 00:05:17,014
 Can you really kill me?

56
00:05:17,977 --> 00:05:19,775
 What?

57
00:05:19,775 --> 00:05:23,064
 Do you really think you can kill me?

58
00:05:24,527 --> 00:05:27,117
 Why are you moving the sword away?

59
00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:33,128
 My last kiss is with...

60
00:05:34,118 --> 00:05:36,011
 you.

61
00:05:43,848 --> 00:05:46,459
 If you kiss me,

62
00:05:47,185 --> 00:05:49,829
 will you  become human?

63
00:05:50,773 --> 00:05:52,654
 What?

64
00:05:53,219 --> 00:05:57,393
 Does that mean you can fulfill your long-held desire of becoming human?

65
00:06:02,603 --> 00:06:05,633
 I won't become human.

66
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:10,189
 Because I'm not going to kiss you.

67
00:06:13,935 --> 00:06:16,188
 Because you don't like me?

68
00:06:21,315 --> 00:06:25,815
 You are human. You only have 40 years to live at most.

69
00:06:25,815 --> 00:06:28,614
 But me...

70
00:06:28,614 --> 00:06:32,473
 I will remember you forever.

71
00:07:21,853 --> 00:07:24,930
Why aren't you coming home?

72
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:28,723
I wanted to think...

73
00:07:28,723 --> 00:07:32,055
Are you excited about becoming a human?

74
00:07:35,563 --> 00:07:37,631
You dressed up.

75
00:07:37,631 --> 00:07:40,091
Do I look pretty?

76
00:07:40,091 --> 00:07:42,503
You are always pretty.

77
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:45,049
But you're pretty in a different way today.

78
00:07:45,049 --> 00:07:47,459
Oh.

79
00:07:53,272 --> 00:07:56,194
I have something to say...

80
00:07:56,812 --> 00:07:58,256
Okay!

81
00:07:58,256 --> 00:08:00,170
I...

82
00:08:01,297 --> 00:08:03,231
think I have to go.

83
00:08:03,231 --> 00:08:05,177
Go where?

84
00:08:06,288 --> 00:08:09,016
To where I originally was.

85
00:08:09,016 --> 00:08:12,330
Where originally?

86
00:08:14,788 --> 00:08:17,288
To the goblin world.

87
00:08:19,309 --> 00:08:21,232
Why?

88
00:08:25,871 --> 00:08:28,245
This whole human thing,

89
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:30,992
I decided not to do it anymore.

90
00:08:32,891 --> 00:08:36,271
Why are you suddenly giving up?

91
00:08:36,271 --> 00:08:40,748
If you go there, can you come back?

92
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:47,009
No, never.

93
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:52,552
What about me?

94
00:08:56,284 --> 00:08:58,474
What is all this? Are you kidding me?

95
00:08:58,474 --> 00:09:02,712
You said you liked me. Did you change your mind? After one day?

96
00:09:02,712 --> 00:09:06,521
I didn't. I like you.

97
00:09:08,518 --> 00:09:13,235
Are you giving up because you have to kiss me as the last person?

98
00:09:18,046 --> 00:09:20,391
 I'll be back soon.

99
00:09:21,542 --> 00:09:23,155
 Where are you going?

100
00:09:23,155 --> 00:09:26,442
 I'm just going to get some Coke at the market.

101
00:09:27,879 --> 00:09:30,583
 He's so bad at lying.

102
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:32,649
 What's going on?

103
00:09:38,714 --> 00:09:41,956

104
00:09:49,534 --> 00:09:53,124
 If you kiss me, your memory about me will be erased.

105
00:09:53,124 --> 00:09:56,341
 Please get up. I'll do anything.

106
00:09:56,341 --> 00:10:00,994
 Can you really do anything for Ban Sook?

107
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:14,077
 If love has temperature,

108
00:10:14,077 --> 00:10:16,892
 I wonder what the temperature is between you and me.

109
00:10:26,571 --> 00:10:28,826
Is that the best you can do?

110
00:10:28,826 --> 00:10:32,708
If I forget you,

111
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:34,602
are you worried you can't make me like you again?

112
00:10:34,602 --> 00:10:36,852
How can you said you liked me when you are this insecure?

113
00:10:36,852 --> 00:10:39,844
Just hit on me! You are handsome

114
00:10:39,844 --> 00:10:41,722
and you are my type.

115
00:10:41,722 --> 00:10:45,541
I will easily fall for you if you try.

116
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:47,924
It's not like that.

117
00:10:47,924 --> 00:10:51,947
Is it because you don't want to kiss me then?

118
00:10:53,638 --> 00:10:55,943
Really?

119
00:10:56,823 --> 00:11:00,054
No, I want to. Even now.

120
00:11:00,054 --> 00:11:02,254
Then do it! I'm ready.

121
00:11:02,254 --> 00:11:05,152
I got myself prepared when I left.

122
00:11:12,904 --> 00:11:15,828
 Goblins were once humans, but they have no memory of when they were human.

123
00:11:15,828 --> 00:11:17,314
 Likewise.

124
00:11:17,314 --> 00:11:21,838
 When goblins become human, the memories of being goblins get erased.

125
00:11:21,838 --> 00:11:25,359
 If you do the last kiss, not only Oh Yeon Ah will lose her memories,

126
00:11:25,359 --> 00:11:29,283
 but you also will lose all memory of Oh Yeon Ah.

127
00:11:32,803 --> 00:11:35,014
 What... What did you say?

128
00:11:37,349 --> 00:11:42,000
 I... How can I forget her?

129
00:11:44,528 --> 00:11:47,511
If I become human,

130
00:11:47,511 --> 00:11:50,693
I lose all memory of being a goblin.

131
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:56,210
Yeon Ah. You and I,

132
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:58,542
will both lose our memories of each other.

133
00:12:01,278 --> 00:12:03,003
What?

134
00:12:03,003 --> 00:12:05,842
 If love has temperature,

135
00:12:05,842 --> 00:12:11,540
 ours must be one degree short of the boiling point. It's 99 degrees.

136
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:15,856
 A temperature that can't boil, can't vaporize.

137
00:12:15,856 --> 00:12:19,390
 But turned off at 99 degrees...

138
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:22,332
We talked about Day 1.

139
00:12:22,332 --> 00:12:26,072
If I don't remember you, that won't be possible.

140
00:12:26,072 --> 00:12:29,549
So I decided to just like you.

141
00:12:29,549 --> 00:12:35,480
I.. I will remember you and continue liking you.

142
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:38,453
 Our love temperature rose.

143
00:12:38,453 --> 00:12:43,140
 But never boiled, not even once.

144
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:47,340
♫  A lonely song  ♫

145
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:49,900
♫  Faraway black  ♫

146
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:52,790
♫  For an eternity  ♫

147
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:55,260
♫  It seemed to have slowly stopped  ♫

148
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:57,508
♫  My time of loneliness  ♫

149
00:12:57,508 --> 00:13:00,117

150
00:13:02,444 --> 00:13:04,780
Then Ban Sook...

151
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:06,988
What does your name mean?

152
00:13:06,988 --> 00:13:09,420
Ban means to be abandoned. Sook, to ripe.

153
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:13,877
I was abandoned in the woods when I was human.

154
00:13:13,877 --> 00:13:16,590
That's how I became a goblin.

155
00:13:17,486 --> 00:13:21,797
Did you live in the woods all by yourself?

156
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:25,000
When you become human, we must change your name.

157
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,372
I'll come up with something good.

158
00:13:27,372 --> 00:13:29,302
Like what?

159
00:13:32,849 --> 00:13:36,468
Happy, so that you are happy.

160
00:13:36,468 --> 00:13:39,450
- Happy? 
 - Happy.

161
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:46,360
