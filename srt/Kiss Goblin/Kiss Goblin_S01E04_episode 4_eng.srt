1
00:00:01,375 --> 00:00:03,575
Hey, Kiss Goblin.

2
00:00:03,575 --> 00:00:06,986
It was nice meeting you, although it was ill-fated.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,865

4
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:23,890
You're Ban Sook, right?

5
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:26,017
Yes, do I know you?

6
00:00:26,017 --> 00:00:28,407
I could just smell it.

7
00:00:28,407 --> 00:00:30,542
The scent of a goblin.

8
00:00:33,695 --> 00:00:35,715
 The exorcist.

9
00:00:35,715 --> 00:00:37,480
 He's going to come and kill you.

10
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:39,254
The exorcist?

11
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:49,960

12
00:00:52,222 --> 00:00:55,900
Stop! Stop it!

13
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,376
 I'm a goblin.

14
00:02:24,376 --> 00:02:28,171
 To become human, I need to kiss 10 human beings.

15
00:02:28,171 --> 00:02:32,554
 After they kiss me, everything about me will be erased from their memory.

16
00:02:32,554 --> 00:02:34,202
Ouch!

17
00:02:35,377 --> 00:02:38,619
 Hold still. Let me put on a band-aid.

18
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,645
Was it a dream?

19
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:50,301
It was a dream, wasn't it?

20
00:02:50,301 --> 00:02:52,456
It wasn't a dream.

21
00:02:53,453 --> 00:02:55,358
Sure it was.

22
00:02:55,358 --> 00:02:58,832
A goblin? Does that make any sense?

23
00:02:58,832 --> 00:03:03,980
Besides, I thought you were too handsome to be real.

24
00:03:05,495 --> 00:03:07,985
I need to wake up from this dream quickly.

25
00:03:09,513 --> 00:03:12,083
Hey, Kiss Goblin.

26
00:03:13,275 --> 00:03:15,350
Kiss Goblin?

27
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:18,234
They say kissing someone makes you wake up.

28
00:03:18,234 --> 00:03:19,752
I told you that this isn't a dream.

29
00:03:19,752 --> 00:03:21,806
I really didn't want to do this,

30
00:03:21,806 --> 00:03:24,359
but I'll just have to bite the bullet. Ok?

31
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:29,375
It was nice meeting you, although it was ill-fated.

32
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,880
Whoa!

33
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,874
Whoa, your lips feel too real!

34
00:04:01,874 --> 00:04:04,716
I've told you it wasn't a dream!

35
00:04:04,716 --> 00:04:06,980
Ahhh!

36
00:04:07,685 --> 00:04:09,319
So it was all real?

37
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:10,933
So you're really a goblin?

38
00:04:10,933 --> 00:04:13,232
Goblins are, you know...

39
00:04:13,232 --> 00:04:14,997
They're characters from fairytales!

40
00:04:14,997 --> 00:04:18,981
Fairytales are mostly based on true stories.

41
00:04:21,591 --> 00:04:23,894
Wow, this is absurd.

42
00:04:23,894 --> 00:04:26,796
Ban Sook, please forget what just happened.

43
00:04:26,796 --> 00:04:29,681
I really thought it was a dream...

44
00:04:36,655 --> 00:04:39,075
By the way,

45
00:04:39,075 --> 00:04:42,115
did you say you'll become human when you kiss 10 people?

46
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:43,639
Yes.

47
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:45,391
How many people have you kissed?

48
00:04:45,391 --> 00:04:48,010
3 , I have 7 more to go.

49
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:51,043
3? Including me just now?

50
00:04:51,043 --> 00:04:52,106
No.

51
00:04:52,106 --> 00:04:54,654
It has to be the person that the Goblin Queen tells me to kiss.

52
00:04:54,654 --> 00:04:57,809
Otherwise, it doesn't count.

53
00:04:57,809 --> 00:05:01,417
Also, an emotion needs to be passed through that person's lips.

54
00:05:01,417 --> 00:05:03,717
But nothing passed through yours.

55
00:05:05,457 --> 00:05:09,358
Who's the Goblin Queen? And what's with that scary guy?

56
00:05:09,358 --> 00:05:11,457
The Goblin Queen is our leader.

57
00:05:11,457 --> 00:05:13,875
And the person you saw earlier is an exorcist.

58
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:17,960
He's going to keep looking for me to stop me from becoming human.

59
00:05:19,145 --> 00:05:21,135
So,

60
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:24,275
am I handsome?

61
00:05:24,275 --> 00:05:27,007
Aishhh!!

62
00:05:42,976 --> 00:05:45,922
Aishhh!! Really?

63
00:05:45,922 --> 00:05:50,055
Are you insane? Why did you do that for?

64
00:05:52,273 --> 00:05:55,640
Aishhh!!

65
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:59,046
The exorcist showed up yesterday.

66
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:03,370
So you finally met him.

67
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:09,379
Why is the exorcist trying to kill us?

68
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:13,303
Goblins used to be humans.

69
00:06:13,303 --> 00:06:17,643
When someone's wounded heart keeps getting torn and ground up,

70
00:06:17,643 --> 00:06:20,614
and that wound gets unimaginably deep,

71
00:06:20,614 --> 00:06:24,134
that person becomes a goblin, bearing deep resentment.

72
00:06:25,575 --> 00:06:28,270
That's why humans are afraid of goblins.

73
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:30,997
They think we'll take revenge on them.

74
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,960
Goblins just want to become humans.

75
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:39,181
But humans hate having goblins around.

76
00:06:39,181 --> 00:06:43,153
So they started to get rid of the goblins who come into this world.

77
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:45,730
Those people are exorcists.

78
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:48,325
They have been getting rid of goblins for generations now.

79
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:52,945
And, in the end, none of us could become human.

80
00:06:54,195 --> 00:06:56,740
No one has been able to do this.

81
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:59,195
But do you really think I can?

82
00:06:59,195 --> 00:07:01,255
I don't know that either.

83
00:07:01,255 --> 00:07:04,176
Doesn't it depend on what you do?

84
00:07:04,176 --> 00:07:07,003
So, immediately after you're done kissing someone, 
before the exorcist gets there,

85
00:07:07,003 --> 00:07:09,733
you need to leave that place.

86
00:07:11,535 --> 00:07:13,470
Yes, I understand.

87
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:16,240
Good. Off you go.

88
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:23,555
Goblin Queen, did you also

89
00:07:24,623 --> 00:07:27,080
want to become a human being?

90
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:33,355
 Did you come here to die by yourself?

91
00:07:34,065 --> 00:07:37,240
 I haven't been able to kill you this past 9 times.

92
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:40,130
 This time I'll make sure I do.

93
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:01,981
This is so embarrassing.

94
00:08:03,219 --> 00:08:05,916
How can he be so unaffected?

95
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:12,250
This tastes so good.

96
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:16,300
 In human relationships, it's important to keep a safe distance.

97
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,940
- Yes! 
 - Thank you!

98
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:24,160
 The moment you get careless, usually, is when accidents happen.

99
00:08:27,665 --> 00:08:31,145
Fender benders are no joke.

100
00:08:31,145 --> 00:08:34,990
Just look at me. I've been suffering the after-effects for the past 2 years.

101
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:37,235
While the victim suffers like this,

102
00:08:37,235 --> 00:08:41,239
the assailant doesn't even know she caused an accident. That's the problem.

103
00:08:42,395 --> 00:08:45,861
Yeon Ah doesn't even know when she causes an accident.

104
00:08:45,861 --> 00:08:48,588
She doesn't even know you have a crush on her.

105
00:08:48,588 --> 00:08:50,880
I've always thought that one day her feelings would swing this way.

106
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,742
So I've been waiting for her to notice me.

107
00:08:55,655 --> 00:08:57,735
But she doesn't see me in that light.

108
00:08:57,735 --> 00:09:00,240
How long are you going to wait in vain?

109
00:09:00,258 --> 00:09:01,983
What?

110
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:07,901
How are people supposed to know if you're waiting for a bus or a taxi?

111
00:09:07,901 --> 00:09:12,926
If you're just standing by the road doing nothing do you think a taxi is going to just stop for you?

112
00:09:12,926 --> 00:09:14,260
If you see a vacant sign on a taxi,

113
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:17,680
you need to wave for it. Taxi!

114
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:23,860
So don't just stand by like a fool and miss an empty taxi.

115
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:26,440
Wave for it and make it stop for you.

116
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,108
You're really articulate.

117
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:31,664
- Yoon Sul Hee! 
 - Yes?

118
00:09:31,664 --> 00:09:34,312
- I need to go now. 
 - Where?

119
00:09:34,312 --> 00:09:37,518
You told me to wave at the taxi. Yeon Ah's shift is almost over.

120
00:09:38,398 --> 00:09:41,738
You're really good at taking advice.

121
00:10:00,075 --> 00:10:01,540
Sorry, we're closed.

122
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:03,082
Who are you?

123
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:05,503
I haven't seen you around before.

124
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,440
Ji Seung Heon!

125
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,610
Yeon Ah.

126
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,089
What are you doing here?

127
00:10:12,089 --> 00:10:14,274
- To take you home. 
 - Why would you do that?

128
00:10:14,274 --> 00:10:16,485
It's late. It's not safe.

129
00:10:16,485 --> 00:10:19,712
I think we're close enough for that.

130
00:10:19,712 --> 00:10:22,397
What are you talking about? Are you drunk?

131
00:10:22,908 --> 00:10:25,078
Just hurry up. Let's go.

132
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,145
Don't forget to lock up before you go. I'm heading off.

133
00:10:38,355 --> 00:10:40,390
Who was that, by the way?

134
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:41,728
A new part-time worker?

135
00:10:41,728 --> 00:10:44,208
Oh yes, a new-part time worker.

136
00:10:44,225 --> 00:10:45,945
Is he really human?

137
00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:47,336
What?

138
00:10:47,336 --> 00:10:48,853
How did you know?

139
00:10:48,853 --> 00:10:50,277
What are you talking about?

140
00:10:50,277 --> 00:10:52,927
I mean, how can a real person be so handsome?

141
00:10:52,927 --> 00:10:54,813
He's seriously handsome.

142
00:10:54,813 --> 00:10:57,288
Handsome? Come on.

143
00:10:57,288 --> 00:11:02,268
But why are you suddenly acting out of character?

144
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,470
Were you surprised?

145
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:07,720
Didn't you expect me to be surprised when you showed up so suddenly?

146
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:10,040
Then I'll surprise you every day.

147
00:11:10,057 --> 00:11:11,457
What?

148
00:11:11,457 --> 00:11:14,063
I'll stop by to pick you up every day.

149
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,945
Why?

150
00:11:18,286 --> 00:11:20,038
Yeon Ah.

151
00:11:20,486 --> 00:11:22,211
I...

152
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,115
I'm going to get a taxi now.

153
00:11:30,075 --> 00:11:32,530
It's hard to get a taxi here.

154
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:34,954
I'm not talking about that kind of taxi.

155
00:11:34,954 --> 00:11:36,551
Then what?

156
00:11:37,028 --> 00:11:38,822
Yeon Ah.

157
00:11:40,013 --> 00:11:41,738
I...

158
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:52,170

159
00:11:53,841 --> 00:11:55,891

160
00:11:55,891 --> 00:11:58,491

161
00:11:58,491 --> 00:12:02,000
