1
00:01:27,124 --> 00:01:30,946
To maintain your inner peace.

2
00:01:31,603 --> 00:01:34,487
To not be sensitive to the external stimulus.

3
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:40,199
As Captain Yellow Duck, with long and curled eyelashes,

4
00:01:40,199 --> 00:01:45,186
floating on a contaminated artificial river.

5
00:01:46,404 --> 00:01:50,784
Words that repeat in my head, over and over, like a spell.

6
00:01:56,645 --> 00:01:58,245
Still,

7
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:04,732
my world has suddenly changed.

8
00:02:56,916 --> 00:02:58,714
Wake up.

9
00:02:59,717 --> 00:03:02,185
Wake up.

10
00:03:02,185 --> 00:03:05,321
Time to get up!

11
00:03:05,321 --> 00:03:06,740
Good morning.

12
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:10,173
What kind of assistant gets up later than his boss?

13
00:03:12,492 --> 00:03:14,449
But it's still early.

14
00:03:14,449 --> 00:03:18,004
We start working as soon as I wake up.

15
00:03:18,004 --> 00:03:20,372
All right. I'm sorry.

16
00:03:20,372 --> 00:03:23,219
- Hurry up and get ready.
- Okay.

17
00:03:24,224 --> 00:03:27,323
Noguchi-san is so high maintenance.

18
00:03:28,047 --> 00:03:30,495
He's not too bad once you get used to it.

19
00:03:30,495 --> 00:03:31,719
To what?

20
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:33,721
Serving the king.

21
00:03:33,721 --> 00:03:35,321
The king?

22
00:03:36,825 --> 00:03:40,591
Hey, I can hear you guys, you know.

23
00:03:41,404 --> 00:03:44,222
However, I do like to be called king.

24
00:03:44,222 --> 00:03:47,950
- No. I wasn't talking about you, Noguchi-san.
- What?

25
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:50,172
It's about a friend?

26
00:03:50,172 --> 00:03:53,971
No, not a friend. Is more like a...

27
00:03:56,524 --> 00:04:00,750
Lover.

28
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,582
Cut! Good.

29
00:04:04,582 --> 00:04:07,425
Well done.

30
00:04:07,425 --> 00:04:09,329
Anna, that was impressive.

31
00:04:09,329 --> 00:04:11,195
President, thank you.

32
00:04:11,195 --> 00:04:14,445
Kiyoi, your expression was excellent!

33
00:04:15,071 --> 00:04:17,538
By the way, tell me more about you two.

34
00:04:17,538 --> 00:04:20,664
Such as how and when you first met.

35
00:04:20,664 --> 00:04:25,298
It startled me to know that such a creepy person existed.

36
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:31,340
When we first met, I couldn't believe that such a beautiful man existed.

37
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:35,479
He was the most popular guy in my class... No, in the entire school.

38
00:04:35,479 --> 00:04:37,852
He was always surrounded by his admirers.

39
00:04:37,852 --> 00:04:40,405
He was born to be a shining star.

40
00:04:42,013 --> 00:04:45,066
Boring and creepy.

41
00:04:45,066 --> 00:04:48,123
He always kept his head down,

42
00:04:48,123 --> 00:04:51,015
giving off a sense of helpless loneliness.

43
00:04:51,015 --> 00:04:52,862
So pathetic.

44
00:04:52,862 --> 00:04:55,131
Then why are you with him?

45
00:04:55,131 --> 00:05:00,676
Because we learned each other's secrets when we were alone together.

46
00:05:01,341 --> 00:05:03,041
Kiyoi...

47
00:05:04,789 --> 00:05:07,061
is like a fanatic.

48
00:05:07,061 --> 00:05:11,885
He's capable of doing anything to protect me.

49
00:05:11,885 --> 00:05:16,218
I was wondering at the time if I could trust him.

50
00:05:17,427 --> 00:05:19,490
And before I knew it,

51
00:05:20,972 --> 00:05:26,534
I had been drawn to his eyes deeply.

52
00:05:27,561 --> 00:05:32,263
I couldn't resist his gaze.

53
00:05:39,302 --> 00:05:41,002
Kiyoi-kun,

54
00:05:42,695 --> 00:05:44,981
are you showing off your love?

55
00:05:44,981 --> 00:05:47,356
What makes you think that?

56
00:05:47,356 --> 00:05:49,476
It's bad, okay?

57
00:05:49,476 --> 00:05:50,820
Here.

58
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:53,077
For example, a while back...

59
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,458
No, don't look, Kiyoi.

60
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:00,297
Why do you collect these things?

61
00:06:00,297 --> 00:06:02,276
They are all related to you. I don't need a reason.

62
00:06:02,276 --> 00:06:03,472
No! Stop looking!

63
00:06:03,472 --> 00:06:05,343
Don't disrespect my house of worship!

64
00:06:05,343 --> 00:06:06,952
But I'm standing right here.

65
00:06:06,952 --> 00:06:09,299
Don't!

66
00:06:10,547 --> 00:06:12,922
You are still showing off.

67
00:06:12,922 --> 00:06:15,357
Why do you keep saying that?

68
00:06:18,007 --> 00:06:21,246
Because I want to hear happy love stories.

69
00:06:21,246 --> 00:06:22,662
What?

70
00:06:23,342 --> 00:06:26,002
- Anna-san, you are on.
- Okay.

71
00:06:26,002 --> 00:06:27,477
- Kiyoi-kun, you can rest a little longer.
- All right.

72
00:06:27,477 --> 00:06:29,722
- Suga-san, please hold it for me.
- Sure.

73
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:33,313
- Give me your coat.
- Okay, thanks.

74
00:06:33,313 --> 00:06:35,532
So are you living together?

75
00:06:35,532 --> 00:06:37,076
Yes.

76
00:06:37,076 --> 00:06:40,370
And she's the one you want to shoot?

77
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:42,730
- Yes.
- I see.

78
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:45,017
Then bring her here next time.

79
00:06:45,017 --> 00:06:48,020
I don't think I'm ready.

80
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:49,531
Why not?

81
00:06:49,531 --> 00:06:54,469
Because I'm afraid you'll laugh at me.

82
00:06:56,333 --> 00:07:00,386
If you don't do your job right, I'll fire you right away.

83
00:07:00,386 --> 00:07:03,176
I... I'm sorry.

84
00:07:03,176 --> 00:07:05,475
You are doing very well. No worries.

85
00:07:05,475 --> 00:07:07,373
I... I am?

86
00:07:07,373 --> 00:07:11,623
It's the first time Noguchi-san has hired a student to be his assistant.

87
00:07:11,623 --> 00:07:14,490
Can you balance your study and work?

88
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:17,108
I don't have classes anymore.

89
00:07:17,108 --> 00:07:18,811
I see.

90
00:07:18,811 --> 00:07:21,066
Did you graduate?

91
00:07:22,047 --> 00:07:24,292
Yes.

92
00:07:24,292 --> 00:07:26,537
Graduation season.

93
00:07:26,537 --> 00:07:31,909
Following the spring we first met, there came a hot summer, a chilly fall,

94
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:36,500
and a cold winter, and then we welcomed spring again.

95
00:07:37,355 --> 00:07:42,311
From there, we embarked upon a new journey.

96
00:07:42,311 --> 00:07:45,172
Kiyoi,

97
00:07:45,928 --> 00:07:48,360
the perfect king, and I.

98
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:52,444
No, he's mine.

99
00:07:52,444 --> 00:07:54,315
He's my king.

100
00:07:54,315 --> 00:08:01,982
[My Beautiful Man - Eternal | He is so Beautiful]

101
00:08:20,407 --> 00:08:22,807
So handsome.

102
00:08:22,807 --> 00:08:25,804
Kiyoi is indeed the most handsome man.

103
00:08:25,804 --> 00:08:28,286
The episode last week was awesome.

104
00:08:28,286 --> 00:08:31,578
Tell me about it. His commanding look was so charming.

105
00:08:31,578 --> 00:08:34,081
Kiyoi-kun, eternal love.

106
00:08:34,081 --> 00:08:35,951
Kiyoi...

107
00:08:39,365 --> 00:08:42,150
Kiyoi-kun.

108
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:43,488
It's that freak again.

109
00:08:43,488 --> 00:08:44,785
It is him.

110
00:08:44,785 --> 00:08:46,293
Freak.

111
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:50,668
I... I'm sorry.

112
00:08:52,456 --> 00:08:54,940
You came.

113
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:56,993
Yes.

114
00:08:56,993 --> 00:09:00,253
I haven't seen you for a while.

115
00:09:00,253 --> 00:09:03,547
I... I've been busy.

116
00:09:03,547 --> 00:09:06,654
But I watched the episode last week.

117
00:09:07,496 --> 00:09:11,896
I'll stand afar and support my hard-working Kiyoi.

118
00:09:11,896 --> 00:09:15,762
He's the center of my life.

119
00:09:15,762 --> 00:09:17,501
I understand.

120
00:09:18,181 --> 00:09:20,181
What?

121
00:09:20,181 --> 00:09:24,715
My feelings for Anna are also growing stronger.

122
00:09:24,715 --> 00:09:27,449
Anna is so amazing.

123
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:32,417
Kiyoi-kun also praised her during an interview.

124
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,839
Right.

125
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:41,788
I thought my love for her would shorten my sight,

126
00:09:41,788 --> 00:09:46,691
but I learned what true love is because of Anna.

127
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:56,829
I brought this. I want to show you.

128
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:06,306
I can't stop thinking about her.

129
00:10:06,306 --> 00:10:11,109
She's so beautiful and pure.

130
00:10:11,109 --> 00:10:15,015
I'll never forget this feeling.

131
00:10:19,071 --> 00:10:21,021
Eternal love.

132
00:10:22,827 --> 00:10:26,174
Oh, sorry.

133
00:10:26,174 --> 00:10:30,935
I understand how you feel.

134
00:10:33,525 --> 00:10:38,686
By the way, what's your name?

135
00:10:40,745 --> 00:10:45,776
You said you understand how I feel.

136
00:10:46,744 --> 00:10:49,050
Well...

137
00:10:49,782 --> 00:10:53,652
My name is Shitara Katsumi.

138
00:10:58,885 --> 00:11:03,748
I... I'm Hi-Hi-Hira Kazunari.

139
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:24,154
Stand afar and think about her without asking for more.

140
00:11:24,154 --> 00:11:27,849
Shitara-san's love for Anna is also pure.

141
00:11:27,849 --> 00:11:31,002
And I've been there.

142
00:11:31,002 --> 00:11:33,036
I'm back.

143
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:40,270
The representative Oizumi Keichi is holding a press conference.

144
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:42,158
But now,

145
00:11:46,035 --> 00:11:49,430
as I can feel Kiyoi and I have slowly drifted apart,

146
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:53,060
I can't get back to that pure love anymore.

147
00:11:53,696 --> 00:11:56,218
I'm back.

148
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:03,300
Oh, right.

149
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,541
Potato.

150
00:12:12,089 --> 00:12:13,889
Ginger Ale.

151
00:12:15,674 --> 00:12:17,474
Eternal love.

152
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,760
Coming.

153
00:12:27,201 --> 00:12:29,017
Naho-chan.

154
00:12:30,476 --> 00:12:33,942
I have something to talk to you.

155
00:12:44,403 --> 00:12:45,896
I'm back.

156
00:12:45,896 --> 00:12:47,586
Welcome home, Kiyoi.

157
00:12:47,586 --> 00:12:49,427
You had a long day on set.

158
00:12:49,427 --> 00:12:51,380
Are we celebrating something?

159
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:53,136
"Celebrating?"

160
00:12:53,136 --> 00:12:55,393
You cooked so many dishes.

161
00:12:56,134 --> 00:12:57,988
What's the occasion?

162
00:12:59,456 --> 00:13:01,406
Your favorite deep-fried prawn fritters.

163
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:03,889
Rice noodle soup.

164
00:13:03,889 --> 00:13:06,952
I also cooked kimbap. I hope it tastes good.

165
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:08,523
What happened?

166
00:13:08,523 --> 00:13:12,065
There must be a reason for you to cook so many dishes.

167
00:13:12,065 --> 00:13:15,357
Look, Kiyoi, deep-fried prawn fritters. It's your favorite.

168
00:13:15,357 --> 00:13:17,357
- Deep-fried prawn fritters.
- Hey.

169
00:13:17,357 --> 00:13:19,357
Say it.

170
00:13:19,358 --> 00:13:20,858
D...

171
00:13:21,753 --> 00:13:23,444
Divorce.

172
00:13:23,444 --> 00:13:24,618
What?

173
00:13:24,618 --> 00:13:27,198
I mean a divorce, a separation, because of the unhappy relationship.

174
00:13:27,198 --> 00:13:30,333
Are you joking? How could you make such a decision behind my back?

175
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:31,817
What did I do that upset you?

176
00:13:31,817 --> 00:13:34,230
How could I be upset with you?

177
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:36,325
Then why? Give me a reason.

178
00:13:36,325 --> 00:13:38,033
The reason is...

179
00:13:38,936 --> 00:13:40,623
an affair.

180
00:13:40,623 --> 00:13:41,570
You are dead.

181
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:44,864
Wait, wait.

182
00:13:44,864 --> 00:13:49,703
No, wait, being killed by you to me could really be a dream come true.

183
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:51,207
Hira, how dare you make fun of me?

184
00:13:51,207 --> 00:13:53,945
It was Naho-chan's decision.

185
00:13:53,945 --> 00:13:55,405
Naho-chan?

186
00:13:55,405 --> 00:13:56,905
Your cousin?

187
00:13:56,905 --> 00:14:01,813
Yes. She is considering leaving her husband.

188
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:05,163
- It hurts.
- Couldn't you add a subject there?

189
00:14:05,163 --> 00:14:06,492
Sorry.

190
00:14:06,492 --> 00:14:11,611
So we will have to move.

191
00:14:11,611 --> 00:14:13,511
Yes.

192
00:14:13,511 --> 00:14:15,174
That makes sense.

193
00:14:15,174 --> 00:14:16,574
Yes.

194
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:20,210
Um... Um...

195
00:14:22,325 --> 00:14:24,737
When I think that I'll have to separate from you this month,

196
00:14:24,737 --> 00:14:27,274
I even lose my will to live.

197
00:14:27,274 --> 00:14:29,415
And so you cooked a lot of deep-fried prawn fritters.

198
00:14:29,415 --> 00:14:31,254
It's our last memory of being together.

199
00:14:31,254 --> 00:14:33,781
Why would it be the last?

200
00:14:33,781 --> 00:14:35,038
What?

201
00:14:35,038 --> 00:14:38,015
We can rent a new house.

202
00:14:38,015 --> 00:14:40,777
"Rent a new house?"

203
00:14:40,777 --> 00:14:43,860
A new house for me and you.

204
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:48,508
So, you can go ahead and keep being happy.

205
00:14:48,508 --> 00:14:51,212
- Are you serious?
- What?

206
00:14:51,212 --> 00:14:53,316
Kiyoi, you'd better think it through.

207
00:14:53,316 --> 00:14:56,620
We'll need to pay rent and buy furniture.

208
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:58,293
It's okay.

209
00:14:58,293 --> 00:15:00,761
You've also found a job.

210
00:15:00,761 --> 00:15:03,190
But I'm just an intern assistant.

211
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:06,032
Moreover, who knows when I can sign a contract as a photographer and start making money.

212
00:15:06,032 --> 00:15:07,940
It's okay.

213
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:11,703
You'll get the Kimura Ihei Award.

214
00:15:11,703 --> 00:15:16,706
But, Kiyoi, listen to me, that award is very influential.

215
00:15:16,706 --> 00:15:20,189
It's like the Akutagawa Award for photography.

216
00:15:20,189 --> 00:15:24,491
So you don't want to live with me?

217
00:15:28,702 --> 00:15:31,046
No, I do.

218
00:15:31,046 --> 00:15:33,016
I do. I want to live with you.

219
00:15:33,016 --> 00:15:36,016
Then stop talking nonsense.

220
00:15:36,016 --> 00:15:39,954
Just cook more deep-fried prawn fritters for me in the future.

221
00:15:48,369 --> 00:15:49,669
You bet.

222
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:53,110
Here.

223
00:15:55,587 --> 00:15:57,024
I knew it. It's delicious.

224
00:15:57,024 --> 00:15:58,435
Come on.

225
00:15:58,435 --> 00:16:01,068
Come on. Have some more.

226
00:16:14,911 --> 00:16:19,194
Where should we rent a new house?

227
00:16:20,388 --> 00:16:23,215
I don't have a fixed location for shooting.

228
00:16:23,215 --> 00:16:25,839
It's more convenient for you to live somewhere close to Noguchi-san.

229
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:30,467
Don't worry about me. I should put your convenience first.

230
00:16:30,467 --> 00:16:36,080
But a quiet place with easy access to transport is always better.

231
00:16:36,786 --> 00:16:38,657
It feels nice.

232
00:16:39,789 --> 00:16:41,151
What does?

233
00:16:41,151 --> 00:16:44,918
This, discussing things together.

234
00:16:46,921 --> 00:16:48,321
Hmm.

235
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:52,904
But I do feel reluctant to leave here.

236
00:16:56,489 --> 00:16:59,501
This place is filled with our memories.

237
00:17:01,151 --> 00:17:03,076
We still have one month.

238
00:17:03,076 --> 00:17:05,876
We can do a lot of things that we haven't done before.

239
00:17:06,738 --> 00:17:08,238
That's right.

240
00:17:10,263 --> 00:17:12,983
Would you... Would you like to take a bath together?

241
00:17:13,712 --> 00:17:15,412
Take a bath?

242
00:17:32,152 --> 00:17:36,658
Come to think of it, I have never taken a bath together with someone before.

243
00:17:36,658 --> 00:17:38,047
True.

244
00:17:40,991 --> 00:17:43,223
Your face is red.

245
00:17:43,223 --> 00:17:46,199
I'm used to taking showers.

246
00:17:46,199 --> 00:17:48,071
Really?

247
00:17:48,071 --> 00:17:50,560
Then you don't have to force yourself.

248
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,775
Are you a fool?

249
00:17:52,775 --> 00:17:55,470
I just don't want you to feel uncomfortable.

250
00:17:56,179 --> 00:18:00,547
Don't you have times when your urges as a man overcome you?

251
00:18:00,547 --> 00:18:02,255
What do you mean?

252
00:18:03,459 --> 00:18:05,928
Like carrying me up without saying a word

253
00:18:05,928 --> 00:18:10,420
and push me on the bed, no matter if I cry out or scream.

254
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:14,743
Don't you have urges like that?

255
00:18:15,832 --> 00:18:18,468
If I ever do that,

256
00:18:18,468 --> 00:18:21,262
I hope you can jump on me and shoot me dead.

257
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:25,128
I wish you would understand me.

258
00:18:30,349 --> 00:18:35,350
My heart is beating so fast right now.

259
00:18:38,103 --> 00:18:42,162
A kiss... kiss me.

260
00:18:59,428 --> 00:19:01,296
You are so beautiful.

261
00:19:07,096 --> 00:19:10,079
The Kiyoi in the mirror is also beautiful.

262
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:12,010
What are you talking about?

263
00:19:15,172 --> 00:19:18,668
Look. Beautiful, right?

264
00:19:51,518 --> 00:19:53,318
Hira.

265
00:20:00,594 --> 00:20:02,498
This way, please.

266
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,120
Hurry.

267
00:20:08,197 --> 00:20:10,381
We're coming in.

268
00:20:12,821 --> 00:20:14,839
It looks nice.

269
00:20:18,985 --> 00:20:20,245
The ceiling is very high.

270
00:20:20,245 --> 00:20:24,294
Yes. The large window maximizes the lighting.

271
00:20:25,088 --> 00:20:27,020
Why did you bring that?

272
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:29,020
We'll check out the house together.

273
00:20:36,307 --> 00:20:38,078
Hey! Be careful.

274
00:20:38,078 --> 00:20:40,286
It can hold a lot of stuff.

275
00:20:45,502 --> 00:20:47,131
- What are you doing?
- Kiyoi.

276
00:20:47,131 --> 00:20:50,261
- Please come in.
- We're coming in.

277
00:20:50,261 --> 00:20:52,525
Spiral stairs.

278
00:20:53,895 --> 00:20:55,619
We can put the bed here.

279
00:20:55,619 --> 00:20:56,708
Right here.

280
00:20:56,708 --> 00:20:59,339
Hmm, how big?

281
00:21:00,832 --> 00:21:03,932
- Must be suitable for a king.
- That's sick.

282
00:21:03,932 --> 00:21:06,302
- Lovely view.
- Yeah.

283
00:21:06,302 --> 00:21:07,797
And the bus station is right there.

284
00:21:07,797 --> 00:21:09,015
- Very close.
- Yes.

285
00:21:09,015 --> 00:21:10,841
What do you think? Do you like this place?

286
00:21:10,841 --> 00:21:13,814
- It's not bad.
- Right? It's very nice overall.

287
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:16,663
I recommend this place highly.

288
00:21:16,663 --> 00:21:19,137
Hira, let's go.

289
00:21:19,137 --> 00:21:20,518
Okay.

290
00:21:24,427 --> 00:21:28,174
I like the balcony of that house.

291
00:21:28,174 --> 00:21:32,287
There are a lot of flyers in the mailboxes.

292
00:21:32,287 --> 00:21:34,647
- Maybe the management company...
- But the price is quite reasonable.

293
00:21:34,647 --> 00:21:36,960
You can't live in a place like that.

294
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,132
- I like the second apartment.
- The bathroom is too small.

295
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:43,135
- I thought you liked taking showers.
- Not anymore.

296
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:46,031
I want a bathtub.

297
00:21:46,031 --> 00:21:49,293
Then where should we choose?

298
00:21:49,293 --> 00:21:51,872
Excuse me, are there other options?

299
00:21:51,872 --> 00:21:55,682
It's difficult for you because you'll share an apartment.

300
00:21:55,682 --> 00:21:59,203
A lot of landlords don't prefer co-tenants.

301
00:21:59,203 --> 00:22:03,638
If it was for a newlywed couple, it'd be much easier.

302
00:22:04,636 --> 00:22:07,207
But with your situation,

303
00:22:07,207 --> 00:22:09,413
your choices are limited.

304
00:22:26,825 --> 00:22:28,625
Thanks.

305
00:22:33,547 --> 00:22:37,874
We tried, but that real estate agency wasn't that reliable.

306
00:22:37,874 --> 00:22:39,119
I agree.

307
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:42,634
And your standards are too high.

308
00:22:42,634 --> 00:22:44,706
You should compromise a little.

309
00:22:44,706 --> 00:22:48,730
You don't understand.

310
00:22:52,663 --> 00:22:56,522
Did you also post?
[Kiyoi Sou's acting skills have improved a lot.]

311
00:22:58,336 --> 00:23:00,795
You are Little Stone, aren't you?

312
00:23:00,795 --> 00:23:04,015
We all want to support you, Kiyoi.

313
00:23:04,015 --> 00:23:05,923
Eternal love.

314
00:23:07,055 --> 00:23:09,483
Besides, you'll pay for it.

315
00:23:09,483 --> 00:23:12,568
What's that? Are you saying I'm stingy?

316
00:23:12,568 --> 00:23:13,498
I'm sorry.

317
00:23:13,498 --> 00:23:15,984
So you do think I'm stingy.

318
00:23:15,984 --> 00:23:17,094
I'm sorry.

319
00:23:17,094 --> 00:23:18,694
Cut it out.

320
00:23:20,908 --> 00:23:24,226
It's my fault.

321
00:23:24,226 --> 00:23:26,308
Do you really think it's your fault?

322
00:23:26,308 --> 00:23:27,841
Yes.

323
00:23:27,841 --> 00:23:33,035
Any place will do, as long as I can be with you.

324
00:23:36,027 --> 00:23:38,547
When can we check out apartments again?

325
00:23:38,547 --> 00:23:41,780
How about next Wednesday?

326
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:47,728
I need to go to Noguchi-san's that day and take pictures of Anna-san.

327
00:23:47,728 --> 00:23:49,335
Oh. For her photo album?

328
00:23:49,335 --> 00:23:52,915
Anna has always asked Noguchi-san to take her photos.

329
00:23:53,777 --> 00:23:57,582
What about Saturday?

330
00:23:57,582 --> 00:23:59,419
I'll be on set that day.

331
00:23:59,419 --> 00:24:02,586
I see. Sorry.

332
00:24:04,335 --> 00:24:06,797
Stop saying sorry.

333
00:24:06,797 --> 00:24:09,221
But I should've arranged my time better.

334
00:24:09,221 --> 00:24:12,740
You've tried your best. No need to say sorry.

335
00:24:13,509 --> 00:24:14,521
But...

336
00:24:14,521 --> 00:24:16,500
No buts.

337
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:21,108
All right. I'll stop.

338
00:24:24,214 --> 00:24:30,264
In the past, I would be happy to just look at him from afar or think about him secretly.

339
00:24:30,264 --> 00:24:32,280
But now,

340
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:37,290
I want to stay in the same world and stand on the same stage as Kiyoi.

341
00:24:37,291 --> 00:24:41,285
I want to take pictures of him as a professional photographer.

342
00:24:41,285 --> 00:24:46,160
Now that I've experienced that happiness, I don't ever want to lose it.

343
00:24:48,352 --> 00:24:51,185
Gosh, how arrogant and greedy I am.

344
00:24:52,456 --> 00:24:56,411
What? You broke up?

345
00:24:56,411 --> 00:24:59,171
Why?

346
00:24:59,171 --> 00:25:02,531
I thought Saki-chan loved you.

347
00:25:03,333 --> 00:25:05,733
She's into someone else now.

348
00:25:08,418 --> 00:25:10,970
I can't believe how cold you are.

349
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:15,290
Isn't being in love with someone else

350
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:19,710
while leading the other one on colder?

351
00:25:21,205 --> 00:25:25,145
Even so...

352
00:25:25,145 --> 00:25:27,183
Hira-san.

353
00:25:28,979 --> 00:25:31,457
I agree.

354
00:25:31,457 --> 00:25:33,144
What?

355
00:25:33,144 --> 00:25:35,039
It's not like you signed a contract.

356
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:37,348
Even married couples can get divorced.

357
00:25:37,348 --> 00:25:41,630
You're colder than I am.

358
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:46,109
It makes me even more afraid of being in a relationship.

359
00:25:46,109 --> 00:25:49,348
Is there anything that can prevent a break-up?

360
00:25:49,348 --> 00:25:51,427
The Kimura Ihei Award.

361
00:25:51,427 --> 00:25:52,627
What?

362
00:25:52,627 --> 00:25:54,847
The Kimura Ihei Award.

363
00:25:54,847 --> 00:25:56,469
Hira-san,

364
00:26:01,373 --> 00:26:04,157
are you going to participate in it?

365
00:26:04,157 --> 00:26:06,171
Well, because...

366
00:26:06,171 --> 00:26:10,787
You said sooner or later, and you wanted to accumulate experience.

367
00:26:10,787 --> 00:26:13,682
No, as soon as possible.

368
00:26:16,102 --> 00:26:23,239
Maybe you should search it online.

369
00:26:24,229 --> 00:26:28,936
I'm a college student who wants to become a professional photographer,

370
00:26:28,936 --> 00:26:33,711
and I want to win the Kimura Ihei Award.

371
00:26:33,711 --> 00:26:37,814
What should I do?

372
00:26:40,381 --> 00:26:44,230
I don't think it's worth asking.

373
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:48,116
It can help us get some objective opinions.

374
00:26:48,116 --> 00:26:49,165
That's right.

375
00:26:49,165 --> 00:26:53,050
Ignorance can be powerful in a way.

376
00:26:53,050 --> 00:26:54,473
What?

377
00:26:55,651 --> 00:26:58,157
I'm complimenting you.

378
00:27:06,409 --> 00:27:10,019
More often than not,

379
00:27:10,019 --> 00:27:13,695
blunt, objective opinions are criticism.

380
00:27:14,801 --> 00:27:17,720
Okay. Let's load them up when the car is here.

381
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,220
All right.

382
00:27:27,272 --> 00:27:32,020
But there's a clear, simple, and meaningful answer.

383
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:36,697
[Best answer: You should go see a doctor.]

384
00:27:38,563 --> 00:27:41,827
Some college students are so interesting.

385
00:27:41,827 --> 00:27:46,217
When I saw that question last night, I almost laughed my lungs out.

386
00:27:46,217 --> 00:27:52,914
To thank the person who brought me joy, I gave him some sincere advice.

387
00:27:52,914 --> 00:27:54,429
What advice?

388
00:27:54,429 --> 00:27:58,144
You should go see a doctor.

389
00:28:00,044 --> 00:28:03,984
I didn't expect the one who has the best answer would be...

390
00:28:03,984 --> 00:28:08,671
What an ambitious young man. He wants to win the Kimura Ihei Award.

391
00:28:10,353 --> 00:28:12,427
The car is here. Let's start loading.

392
00:28:12,427 --> 00:28:13,927
Okay.

393
00:28:20,797 --> 00:28:26,595
[Kimura Ihei Award]

394
00:28:43,317 --> 00:28:46,981
An A-lister indeed. She's so fairylike.

395
00:28:46,981 --> 00:28:48,820
True.

396
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:51,587
Anna, as an up-and-coming actress with excellent acting skills,

397
00:28:51,587 --> 00:28:53,717
is believed to be one of the nominees for the next Best Actress award.

398
00:28:53,717 --> 00:28:56,156
But the magazines criticize her for being arrogant and rude.

399
00:28:56,156 --> 00:29:01,376
Rumors of her being a willful queen keep spreading.

400
00:29:03,753 --> 00:29:07,984
S-Sorry for keeping you waiting.

401
00:29:07,984 --> 00:29:09,379
Don't worry about it.

402
00:29:09,379 --> 00:29:11,079
Please.

403
00:29:11,079 --> 00:29:12,890
Thank you.

404
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:14,757
I'll drink it.

405
00:29:16,766 --> 00:29:20,941
Actually, Anna-san is nothing like what the criticism says.

406
00:29:30,926 --> 00:29:33,535
We are losing the light.

407
00:29:33,535 --> 00:29:35,687
Do you need supplementary lighting?

408
00:29:35,687 --> 00:29:37,848
No. We are almost done here.

409
00:29:37,848 --> 00:29:40,457
- All right.
- Noguchi-san.

410
00:29:40,457 --> 00:29:42,804
A storm is coming.

411
00:29:47,316 --> 00:29:50,411
Shall we proceed to the riverside or go back to the studio?

412
00:29:50,411 --> 00:29:53,283
Hmm, well...

413
00:29:59,411 --> 00:30:03,748
Anna, can we do the photo shoot in the rain?

414
00:30:05,175 --> 00:30:06,394
I'm okay with it.

415
00:30:06,394 --> 00:30:07,901
Do we need to check with her agency?

416
00:30:07,901 --> 00:30:10,667
I just called the president. He agreed.

417
00:30:15,083 --> 00:30:16,783
Is that okay for you?

418
00:30:16,783 --> 00:30:21,193
The pouring rain will bring out your toughness.

419
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:23,876
It's the god of photography's will to show your beauty in this way.

420
00:30:23,876 --> 00:30:26,315
That's why he prepared this storm for us.

421
00:30:27,333 --> 00:30:29,333
Okay.

422
00:30:29,333 --> 00:30:31,206
Hira, put away the lighting equipment.

423
00:30:31,206 --> 00:30:33,410
We'll have a race against time. Let's make it quick.

424
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:34,910
Okay.

425
00:30:40,626 --> 00:30:43,431
Lower your head looking unhappy.

426
00:30:43,431 --> 00:30:44,931
Good.

427
00:30:54,824 --> 00:30:59,381
Now, Anna, I want you to laugh, loud and hearty.

428
00:30:59,381 --> 00:31:01,202
Let it out.

429
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:10,361
Go on. Extremely happy.

430
00:31:11,191 --> 00:31:12,986
Go on.

431
00:31:12,986 --> 00:31:15,590
Exactly like that. Be free.

432
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:17,541
Set yourself free.

433
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:25,750
The shooting was quick and unorderly,

434
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:28,302
so were the instructions.

435
00:31:29,348 --> 00:31:31,648
However,

436
00:31:31,648 --> 00:31:35,733
she's dazzlingly beautiful. Her magical power...

437
00:31:36,747 --> 00:31:40,307
was dazzling, so dazzling...

438
00:31:41,648 --> 00:31:44,468
that I couldn't even look at her directly.

439
00:31:51,195 --> 00:31:52,967
That's a wrap.

440
00:31:59,456 --> 00:32:00,733
You are amazing.

441
00:32:00,733 --> 00:32:04,050
It's such an honor to have you be my photographer.

442
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:12,913
That's what a gifted photographer is supposed to be like.

443
00:32:12,913 --> 00:32:15,000
I'm a mess.

444
00:32:16,226 --> 00:32:21,150
The pressing dark clouds and the fierce storm

445
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:23,850
were all made full use of by Noguchi-san.

446
00:32:23,856 --> 00:32:29,226
Anna-san's charm was thoroughly brought out in a way that's nearly savage.

447
00:32:30,118 --> 00:32:32,988
Noguchi-san is so incredible.

448
00:32:32,988 --> 00:32:34,646
When shooting a superstar like Anna,

449
00:32:34,646 --> 00:32:37,255
instead of making her follow his instructions,

450
00:32:37,255 --> 00:32:40,603
he guided her to bring out her own personality.

451
00:32:40,603 --> 00:32:43,743
He calls himself "No Face Man."

452
00:32:43,743 --> 00:32:45,801
He... He does?

453
00:32:45,801 --> 00:32:48,800
I heard he used to shoot sceneries only,

454
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,737
but he didn't achieve much in that field.

455
00:32:50,737 --> 00:32:54,374
To make a living, he became a portrait photographer.

456
00:32:54,374 --> 00:32:57,308
So, sometimes, changing directions is the best choice.

457
00:32:59,487 --> 00:33:00,909
You are still here.

458
00:33:00,909 --> 00:33:03,940
I'm leaving soon. I have a photoshoot tomorrow.

459
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:06,216
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

460
00:33:06,216 --> 00:33:07,949
Goodbye.

461
00:33:07,949 --> 00:33:10,020
See you.

462
00:33:12,152 --> 00:33:15,843
What do you think about the photos?

463
00:33:15,857 --> 00:33:18,841
I... I think they are great.

464
00:33:18,841 --> 00:33:20,294
It's like a line from a TV show.

465
00:33:20,294 --> 00:33:22,555
No. I mean it.

466
00:33:22,555 --> 00:33:27,419
I was thinking about how to take photos like yours.

467
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:31,851
Find something online and plagiarize it.

468
00:33:31,851 --> 00:33:33,023
What?

469
00:33:33,023 --> 00:33:35,621
Don't take it seriously. I was joking.

470
00:33:36,682 --> 00:33:38,943
Oh, sorry.

471
00:33:42,714 --> 00:33:47,558
The quality of the photos doesn't depend on the style,

472
00:33:47,558 --> 00:33:51,198
but on what you really want to express.

473
00:33:51,198 --> 00:33:53,306
Don't you think?

474
00:33:53,306 --> 00:33:56,137
You've also got something that you want to shoot, right?

475
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:06,304
No, I don't.

476
00:34:07,486 --> 00:34:09,095
Say again?

477
00:34:09,095 --> 00:34:11,571
Have you changed your mind?

478
00:34:11,571 --> 00:34:14,320
No, it's not like that.

479
00:34:16,098 --> 00:34:20,572
I don't think it's something that someone like me is qualified enough to shoot.

480
00:34:26,579 --> 00:34:31,621
To fully understand the model's traits and thoroughly bring out their charm.

481
00:34:31,621 --> 00:34:37,070
I don't think I'm capable of taking such lively pictures.

482
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:40,171
No matter how much I want to take pictures of Kiyoi,

483
00:34:40,171 --> 00:34:42,174
it's only my own wish after all.

484
00:34:46,596 --> 00:34:48,658
- Hey.
- Hold on. Hold on.

485
00:34:48,658 --> 00:34:50,708
What are you doing?

486
00:34:51,849 --> 00:34:53,571
Put the sheets on.

487
00:34:53,571 --> 00:34:55,658
- Sheets?
- Yes.

488
00:34:56,592 --> 00:34:58,092
Get in.

489
00:35:01,657 --> 00:35:03,181
How to do it?

490
00:35:03,181 --> 00:35:07,277
Well, here's the ring.

491
00:35:07,277 --> 00:35:09,662
Make a bowknot.

492
00:35:11,623 --> 00:35:14,347
It's so difficult.

493
00:35:14,347 --> 00:35:15,940
Let me.

494
00:35:20,564 --> 00:35:22,364
Like this.

495
00:35:23,174 --> 00:35:26,703
You are good at doing housework.

496
00:35:26,703 --> 00:35:28,166
Not really.

497
00:35:28,166 --> 00:35:30,777
I never did it when I lived with my parents.

498
00:35:30,777 --> 00:35:32,309
But now you do.

499
00:35:32,309 --> 00:35:36,626
And you are a good cook, also good at cleaning and doing laundry and stuff.

500
00:35:36,626 --> 00:35:40,788
Because I want to make your life easier.

501
00:35:41,904 --> 00:35:44,210
Okay, done.

502
00:35:45,099 --> 00:35:46,799
Thank you.

503
00:35:48,370 --> 00:35:51,746
I should thank you.

504
00:35:51,746 --> 00:35:53,569
Why thank me?

505
00:35:54,332 --> 00:35:58,344
I'm a better person because of you.

506
00:36:00,976 --> 00:36:05,381
By the way, I've asked Mr. Noguchi-san to take pictures of me.

507
00:36:05,381 --> 00:36:06,485
What?

508
00:36:06,485 --> 00:36:08,705
And we'll all be there during the photo shoot.

509
00:36:12,505 --> 00:36:16,082
Yes, we will.

510
00:36:18,349 --> 00:36:21,053
My pent-up frustration erupted.

511
00:36:29,697 --> 00:36:32,550
It's so stupid,

512
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:38,036
and I know I shouldn't be jealous.

513
00:36:38,036 --> 00:36:40,571
I'm not able to take such brilliant pictures.

514
00:36:40,571 --> 00:36:44,975
He will make Kiyoi look amazing.

515
00:36:44,975 --> 00:36:51,157
But no one appreciates Kiyoi's real charm better than I do.

516
00:36:51,157 --> 00:36:52,713
It hurts.

517
00:36:58,231 --> 00:37:00,325
Are... Are you okay?

518
00:37:00,325 --> 00:37:02,595
I'm fine.

519
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:05,887
- You sure?
- I'm sure.

520
00:37:05,887 --> 00:37:08,843
Let's go on.

521
00:37:13,952 --> 00:37:15,519
Perhaps...

522
00:37:17,301 --> 00:37:20,876
I do need to go see a doctor.

523
00:37:20,876 --> 00:37:24,026
What did you say?

524
00:37:47,317 --> 00:37:49,375
Here we go.

525
00:37:54,665 --> 00:37:56,760
I'm looking forward to working with you.

526
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:59,174
- Thank you very much.
- Thanks.

527
00:37:59,174 --> 00:38:01,095
You must be Kiyoi Sou.

528
00:38:01,095 --> 00:38:02,349
I am.

529
00:38:02,349 --> 00:38:04,841
You are handsome.

530
00:38:04,841 --> 00:38:06,079
Thanks.

531
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:08,135
You are shooting a TV show with Anna, aren't you?

532
00:38:08,135 --> 00:38:09,863
Yes.

533
00:38:09,863 --> 00:38:12,046
By the way, the pictures you took of Anna are amazing.

534
00:38:12,046 --> 00:38:14,214
Even our president is impressed.

535
00:38:14,214 --> 00:38:15,503
Good to know.

536
00:38:15,503 --> 00:38:17,213
Your phone.

537
00:38:17,213 --> 00:38:19,511
Please answer it.

538
00:38:19,511 --> 00:38:21,812
Excuse me.

539
00:38:21,812 --> 00:38:24,094
Yes.

540
00:38:24,094 --> 00:38:25,243
Shall we begin?

541
00:38:25,243 --> 00:38:26,896
All set.

542
00:38:26,896 --> 00:38:28,396
Good.

543
00:38:29,182 --> 00:38:32,026
There you go. Very nice.

544
00:38:34,101 --> 00:38:35,186
Good.

545
00:38:35,186 --> 00:38:36,532
The last one. Look over here.

546
00:38:36,532 --> 00:38:38,799
Nice. Very good.

547
00:38:38,799 --> 00:38:39,944
All right.

548
00:38:39,944 --> 00:38:41,404
It's a wrap. Good job.

549
00:38:41,404 --> 00:38:42,785
- Thank you.
- Well done.

550
00:38:42,785 --> 00:38:44,382
Thanks.

551
00:38:44,382 --> 00:38:47,320
Well, I heard you have an assistant named Hira.

552
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:51,200
He's off today. He's still a college student.

553
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,055
Do you know him?

554
00:38:53,055 --> 00:38:55,052
We were classmates in high school.

555
00:38:55,052 --> 00:38:59,062
So you've been friends? You don't seem to have much in common.

556
00:38:59,062 --> 00:39:01,590
That's true. We don't.

557
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:04,567
It's the way a school is, and even more so in high school...

558
00:39:05,887 --> 00:39:09,537
Cramming different kinds of people into a small space, namely a classroom,

559
00:39:09,537 --> 00:39:12,770
which must be oppressive and frustrating

560
00:39:12,770 --> 00:39:17,063
to growing young people.

561
00:39:17,063 --> 00:39:21,889
Hira, however, is like a king in sheep's clothing.

562
00:39:21,889 --> 00:39:23,915
Maybe you two aren't that different after all.

563
00:39:23,915 --> 00:39:26,080
Thank you.

564
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,325
What is it?

565
00:39:30,325 --> 00:39:33,437
Nothing. I just think you are quite insightful.

566
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:36,079
I know.

567
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:38,793
Hira may seem to be weak, but he has strong self-awareness.

568
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:42,413
There's something in his heart that he doesn't allow anybody to disturb.

569
00:39:42,413 --> 00:39:46,478
His true colors will show if that place is invaded.

570
00:39:46,478 --> 00:39:49,515
Something that he doesn't allow anybody to disturb.

571
00:39:49,515 --> 00:39:54,605
But an artist who has an inner sanctuary can be very powerful.

572
00:39:54,605 --> 00:40:00,451
Whether it'll become his shackle or his unique feature totally depends on himself.

573
00:40:01,293 --> 00:40:05,719
Then is he able to win the Kimura Ihei Award?

574
00:40:05,719 --> 00:40:07,153
What?

575
00:40:08,405 --> 00:40:11,108
That's simply impossible.

576
00:40:11,108 --> 00:40:15,274
Do you think a film directed by a student can win an Oscar?

577
00:40:15,274 --> 00:40:18,825
So it's not totally impossible, right?

578
00:40:20,433 --> 00:40:21,539
You are funny.

579
00:40:21,539 --> 00:40:23,967
- Hira is lucky to have a friend like him.
- That's right.

580
00:40:23,967 --> 00:40:26,333
Actually, I wouldn't say we are friends.

581
00:40:26,333 --> 00:40:31,330
Besides, he's still in a stage where he's not sure what he wants to shoot.

582
00:40:33,270 --> 00:40:34,372
What?

583
00:40:34,372 --> 00:40:36,309
He seems to be lost.

584
00:40:36,309 --> 00:40:38,701
That's normal, though.

585
00:40:40,830 --> 00:40:43,113
Is that so?

586
00:40:44,545 --> 00:40:46,861
So sorry.

587
00:40:46,861 --> 00:40:49,610
Kiyoi-kun, something's up.

588
00:40:49,610 --> 00:40:51,565
You need to be on set later, right?

589
00:40:51,565 --> 00:40:53,138
Then we'll have to reschedule the photo shoot.

590
00:40:53,138 --> 00:40:56,662
No, we've got a situation.

591
00:40:56,662 --> 00:40:58,162
Right?

592
00:41:09,455 --> 00:41:11,186
Strange.

593
00:41:11,186 --> 00:41:13,504
What are they waiting for?

594
00:41:20,576 --> 00:41:23,761
What? Guys, check this out.

595
00:41:23,761 --> 00:41:24,817
What?

596
00:41:24,817 --> 00:41:27,561
The news online.

597
00:41:32,782 --> 00:41:35,106
Is that Anna?
[Kiriya Keisuke and Anna's relationship exposed]

598
00:41:35,106 --> 00:41:39,396
Why is she dating a celebrity from another agency?

599
00:41:39,396 --> 00:41:42,762
I thought Kiriya-kun had a girlfriend, his childhood sweetheart.

600
00:41:42,762 --> 00:41:44,301
That's awful.

601
00:41:44,301 --> 00:41:45,993
Shocking.

602
00:41:45,993 --> 00:41:49,190
Guys, don't be like this.

603
00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:50,898
Han-san.

604
00:41:50,898 --> 00:41:52,943
We should think about Kiyoi.

605
00:41:52,943 --> 00:41:56,190
He and Anna-san are in the same agency.

606
00:41:56,190 --> 00:41:58,491
Hope this incident won't affect him.

607
00:41:58,491 --> 00:42:01,270
We can't cause him any trouble, especially at times like this.

608
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:05,650
But if Anna-san is in trouble, Kiyoi-kun's work will also be affected.

609
00:42:05,650 --> 00:42:07,636
The shooting will be delayed.

610
00:42:07,636 --> 00:42:10,285
Even so, we can't panic.

611
00:42:10,285 --> 00:42:14,401
Stay calm, lay low,

612
00:42:14,401 --> 00:42:17,563
let it be, and be there for him.

613
00:42:17,563 --> 00:42:19,862
As his fans,

614
00:42:20,722 --> 00:42:24,322
this is the best we can do for Kiyoi-kun at the moment.

615
00:42:29,317 --> 00:42:32,283
Let's not spread the rumor about Anna-san.

616
00:42:33,071 --> 00:42:38,179
She is the glamorous Anna in front of the camera but she's just like us in real life.

617
00:42:40,864 --> 00:42:42,713
That's right.

618
00:42:42,713 --> 00:42:47,578
She's just an ordinary girl like us.

619
00:42:48,809 --> 00:42:51,355
An ordinary girl.

620
00:42:51,355 --> 00:42:53,487
An ordinary girl.

621
00:42:55,127 --> 00:42:57,584
You'd better stop reading the news.

622
00:42:57,584 --> 00:42:58,869
Why?

623
00:42:58,869 --> 00:43:02,284
I don't want you to get upset.

624
00:43:03,324 --> 00:43:07,344
I'm not worried about myself.

625
00:43:07,344 --> 00:43:09,868
S-Shitara-san.

626
00:43:10,943 --> 00:43:14,540
Anna will get through this.

627
00:43:31,959 --> 00:43:34,653
It's me.

628
00:43:34,653 --> 00:43:36,031
Sorry.

629
00:43:36,031 --> 00:43:37,468
It's tomorrow, right?

630
00:43:37,468 --> 00:43:40,989
I think we can figure out a time by tonight.

631
00:43:40,989 --> 00:43:42,861
I'll let you know later.

632
00:43:42,861 --> 00:43:46,057
Sorry, the network was down in our company today.

633
00:43:46,057 --> 00:43:47,757
Sorry about that.

634
00:43:51,126 --> 00:43:53,025
Have you eaten anything?

635
00:43:57,682 --> 00:43:59,444
You should eat something.

636
00:43:59,444 --> 00:44:01,724
Let me order you something from room service.

637
00:44:04,690 --> 00:44:08,945
Sorry to put you out when you come to visit me.

638
00:44:10,746 --> 00:44:14,734
Don't think too much.

639
00:44:16,745 --> 00:44:20,457
I caused trouble to all of you.

640
00:44:22,642 --> 00:44:25,523
No trouble at all.

641
00:44:25,523 --> 00:44:28,658
We are just worried about you.

642
00:44:39,253 --> 00:44:45,143
Have you seen... Kiriya-san?

643
00:44:49,627 --> 00:44:55,496
He's under his agent's supervision 24/7.

644
00:44:57,967 --> 00:45:00,597
His agent is forcing him to break up with me.

645
00:45:03,881 --> 00:45:05,850
After all,

646
00:45:06,790 --> 00:45:09,820
he's taking photos for a wedding magazine

647
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:12,650
and an ad for appliances.

648
00:45:13,603 --> 00:45:18,314
It's not like you are having an affair.

649
00:45:18,314 --> 00:45:20,440
We started dating

650
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:25,420
after he broke up with his ex.

651
00:45:26,386 --> 00:45:28,446
Then there should be no problem...

652
00:45:34,115 --> 00:45:35,615
Sorry.

653
00:45:37,531 --> 00:45:40,408
Because a celebrity's image is everything.

654
00:45:41,754 --> 00:45:47,708
It's no longer just about me and Kiriya-kun.

655
00:45:50,917 --> 00:45:54,167
Okay, talk to you later.

656
00:45:59,274 --> 00:46:02,654
Kiyoi-kun, we got to go.

657
00:46:03,992 --> 00:46:08,473
Anna-san, these are your favorite fruits.

658
00:46:11,921 --> 00:46:14,698
Make sure to eat something.

659
00:46:17,197 --> 00:46:18,797
Let's go.

660
00:46:29,298 --> 00:46:31,237
Come on.

661
00:46:49,666 --> 00:46:51,383
I booked a car. Wait here.

662
00:46:51,383 --> 00:46:52,883
Okay.

663
00:47:15,708 --> 00:47:16,755
I'm back.

664
00:47:16,755 --> 00:47:18,355
Welcome home.

665
00:47:20,413 --> 00:47:24,071
The shooting of the TV show is on hold now?

666
00:47:24,071 --> 00:47:28,166
It's not continent for Anna to show up in public yet.

667
00:47:29,636 --> 00:47:32,430
Is it that serious?

668
00:47:32,430 --> 00:47:38,229
She also lost a commercial contract and a leading role in a movie.

669
00:47:38,229 --> 00:47:41,447
Sure enough, it turned out to be this way.

670
00:47:41,447 --> 00:47:43,433
Think about it,

671
00:47:43,433 --> 00:47:46,765
she'll lose her love and job at the same time.

672
00:47:46,765 --> 00:47:52,174
It's like you have to deal with such disasters as being kicked out of college,

673
00:47:52,174 --> 00:47:55,287
fired by Noguchi-san, and dumped by me altogether.

674
00:47:58,193 --> 00:48:01,653
Of course, she'll get her job back when this thing goes away,

675
00:48:01,653 --> 00:48:03,603
but she will have to end her relationship.

676
00:48:03,603 --> 00:48:05,003
What?

677
00:48:06,270 --> 00:48:09,237
I've been worried about her,

678
00:48:09,237 --> 00:48:13,439
wondering if she can handle it all by herself.

679
00:48:14,373 --> 00:48:18,305
What if we invite her to stay here for a while?

680
00:48:18,305 --> 00:48:20,754
What? Let Anna stay with us?

681
00:48:20,754 --> 00:48:23,643
No. We can move out.

682
00:48:23,643 --> 00:48:25,997
Leaving her here alone won't make a difference.

683
00:48:25,997 --> 00:48:27,997
She'll have Naho-chan.

684
00:48:27,997 --> 00:48:28,858
What?

685
00:48:28,858 --> 00:48:31,512
We can leave her to Naho-chan.

686
00:48:31,512 --> 00:48:33,824
She's reliable indeed.

687
00:48:33,824 --> 00:48:35,079
But if she accidentally gives it away...

688
00:48:35,079 --> 00:48:38,920
Naho-chan won't tell anybody. She hates the media.

689
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:40,620
What?

690
00:48:40,620 --> 00:48:45,119
Lately, a magazine just reported that a Diet member was having an affair.

691
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:46,311
I've heard.

692
00:48:46,311 --> 00:48:50,428
That Diet member is Naho-chan's husband.

693
00:48:50,428 --> 00:48:51,928
What?

694
00:48:54,459 --> 00:48:56,427
Excuse me.

695
00:49:01,343 --> 00:49:03,688
I'll be in your care.

696
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:06,057
Sure.

697
00:49:06,057 --> 00:49:09,571
Anna-san, make yourself at home.

698
00:49:11,179 --> 00:49:14,069
Tomoya, say hi.

699
00:49:14,069 --> 00:49:15,820
I've seen your TV series.

700
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:17,113
What are you saying, Tomoya?

701
00:49:17,113 --> 00:49:19,628
Are you saying you like Anna?

702
00:49:19,628 --> 00:49:23,032
Kiyoi, you are bad.

703
00:49:29,901 --> 00:49:31,494
Kiyoi-kun, thank you.

704
00:49:31,494 --> 00:49:34,929
Don't thank me. It was his idea.

705
00:49:36,119 --> 00:49:40,810
Hira-kun, thank you so much.

706
00:49:42,140 --> 00:49:48,714
I'm afraid I would lose my mind if I kept staying in the hotel.

707
00:49:50,532 --> 00:49:54,857
I envy you for having a reliable boyfriend like him.

708
00:49:54,857 --> 00:49:56,220
Don't let his appearance fool you.

709
00:49:56,220 --> 00:49:59,682
He can be very short-tempered, creeping, and annoying.

710
00:49:59,682 --> 00:50:01,480
That's too far.

711
00:50:02,242 --> 00:50:04,434
No, it's okay.

712
00:50:04,434 --> 00:50:08,336
He's been talking about me like that since high school.

713
00:50:13,483 --> 00:50:14,588
What is it?

714
00:50:14,588 --> 00:50:19,860
You were smiling while you said those words.

715
00:50:20,817 --> 00:50:25,906
Don't get me wrong. Not anybody can talk about me like that.

716
00:50:25,906 --> 00:50:27,663
Kiyoi is an exception.

717
00:50:27,663 --> 00:50:29,763
What?

718
00:50:29,763 --> 00:50:33,329
Because he's very special to me.

719
00:50:36,643 --> 00:50:38,482
How happy you are.

720
00:50:40,452 --> 00:50:44,119
I also wanted to be that special someone to Kiriya-kun before.

721
00:50:44,119 --> 00:50:46,238
Why before?

722
00:50:49,221 --> 00:50:52,138
I don't want to trouble you,

723
00:50:55,770 --> 00:50:58,279
but with my current situation...

724
00:51:04,102 --> 00:51:09,226
Because of your current situation, that's all the more reason to hang in there.

725
00:51:12,753 --> 00:51:15,322
Even if you aren't understood,

726
00:51:15,322 --> 00:51:20,125
as long as you have a shining star in your heart,

727
00:51:20,918 --> 00:51:22,978
you'll have the courage to get through this.

728
00:51:24,514 --> 00:51:26,114
Star?

729
00:51:28,669 --> 00:51:33,490
It won't be over unless the star is gone.

730
00:51:34,448 --> 00:51:39,462
But I'll do whatever it takes to keep him there.

731
00:51:49,089 --> 00:51:51,386
I'm talking about myself.

732
00:51:51,386 --> 00:51:54,270
Sorry, I was talking nonsense again.

733
00:51:54,270 --> 00:51:56,249
That shining star you mentioned refers to...

734
00:51:56,249 --> 00:51:57,749
Kiyoi.

735
00:51:59,635 --> 00:52:01,988
As long as Kiyoi is with me,

736
00:52:01,988 --> 00:52:05,248
I don't care if the entire world is against me.

737
00:52:07,717 --> 00:52:11,405
Hira, Tomoya, I need your help.

738
00:52:11,405 --> 00:52:13,113
Coming.

739
00:52:13,113 --> 00:52:14,571
All right.

740
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:25,838
Your boyfriend is impressive.

741
00:52:25,838 --> 00:52:27,441
Creeping, right?

742
00:52:27,441 --> 00:52:28,754
- A little.
- Hey.

743
00:52:28,754 --> 00:52:30,454
Sorry.

744
00:52:32,237 --> 00:52:36,505
But what he said really touched me.

745
00:52:37,705 --> 00:52:43,214
As long as you have a shining star in your heart...

746
00:52:48,872 --> 00:52:50,515
Are we moving out?

747
00:52:50,515 --> 00:52:53,611
Yes, soon.

748
00:52:56,530 --> 00:52:58,717
Shall we stay in a hotel first?

749
00:52:58,717 --> 00:53:02,166
It'll take a while before we start shooting again.

750
00:53:02,166 --> 00:53:04,837
Let's find a place close to Noguchi-san's studio.

751
00:53:04,837 --> 00:53:07,709
We should find a place that's convenient for you.

752
00:53:09,078 --> 00:53:11,507
- Unbelievable.
- What's wrong?

753
00:53:11,507 --> 00:53:15,182
It's so difficult to discuss things with you.

754
00:53:17,659 --> 00:53:21,595
I'll stay at Noguchi-san's for a while.

755
00:53:21,595 --> 00:53:23,086
What?

756
00:53:23,086 --> 00:53:24,450
Yes.

757
00:53:25,586 --> 00:53:28,812
Are you busy at work?

758
00:53:28,812 --> 00:53:32,817
It's part of the reason.

759
00:53:32,817 --> 00:53:35,078
The main reason is that I don't want to cause trouble for you.

760
00:53:35,078 --> 00:53:40,013
Han-san said you need to be cautious after Anna's incident.

761
00:53:40,013 --> 00:53:41,476
I see.

762
00:53:41,476 --> 00:53:45,089
I don't want to burden you at times like this.

763
00:53:45,089 --> 00:53:49,066
I'm your number one fan.

764
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:53,768
How could you?

765
00:53:54,904 --> 00:53:56,304
What?

766
00:54:01,826 --> 00:54:04,757
Are you angry?

767
00:54:04,757 --> 00:54:07,295
Did I say something wrong?

768
00:54:07,295 --> 00:54:13,841
I'm angry because of your unconventional way of thinking.

769
00:54:13,841 --> 00:54:15,873
But I've gotten used to it.

770
00:54:16,814 --> 00:54:20,222
Then why are you upset?

771
00:54:20,222 --> 00:54:24,067
You said you were my fan.

772
00:54:24,067 --> 00:54:25,480
Yes.

773
00:54:26,673 --> 00:54:28,673
You are my boyfriend, okay?

774
00:54:29,436 --> 00:54:31,848
Even so...

775
00:54:31,848 --> 00:54:34,658
Then what did you mean

776
00:54:34,658 --> 00:54:37,877
when you said, "as long as he's with me"? It was a lie, wasn't it?

777
00:54:37,877 --> 00:54:39,741
Of course not.

778
00:54:39,741 --> 00:54:43,489
Being with me doesn't mean you have to stay by my side.

779
00:54:43,489 --> 00:54:46,957
You can be anywhere as long as you are there for me.

780
00:54:47,658 --> 00:54:53,354
I'm of course happy when you are by my side, but if you are not,

781
00:54:54,024 --> 00:54:56,441
I can still watch you shine.

782
00:54:57,293 --> 00:54:59,093
You are right.

783
00:55:00,266 --> 00:55:03,238
Maybe it's better for us to separate.

784
00:55:03,238 --> 00:55:07,659
Your logic is not hard to follow.

785
00:55:08,547 --> 00:55:10,520
Good.

786
00:55:11,484 --> 00:55:13,878
But I want to ask you,

787
00:55:15,428 --> 00:55:19,725
do you really like me?

788
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:21,904
I do.

789
00:55:21,904 --> 00:55:26,236
But your feelings for me can be restrained, right?

790
00:55:26,236 --> 00:55:28,443
You've changed.

791
00:55:29,498 --> 00:55:30,910
What?

792
00:55:31,598 --> 00:55:33,875
The Hira...

793
00:55:33,875 --> 00:55:37,856
who once fought Shirota and tried desperately to protect me...

794
00:55:38,516 --> 00:55:40,726
has gone.

795
00:55:44,052 --> 00:55:45,552
Sorry.

796
00:55:46,705 --> 00:55:48,877
I shouldn't have asked you that.

797
00:55:48,877 --> 00:55:50,477
Kiyoi.

798
00:55:50,477 --> 00:55:54,933
You said you didn't know what you wanted to shoot.

799
00:55:59,031 --> 00:56:01,482
Noguchi-san told me that.

800
00:56:30,201 --> 00:56:34,697
If only Kiyoi were a real star,

801
00:56:34,697 --> 00:56:40,122
a shining star that existed in a universe where doesn't have

802
00:56:40,122 --> 00:56:43,179
the complicated showbiz and the Kimura Ihei Award.

803
00:56:43,179 --> 00:56:45,919
If only we could meet in a universe like that.

804
00:56:50,928 --> 00:56:52,828
Hey.

805
00:56:52,828 --> 00:56:54,470
Hey.

806
00:56:54,470 --> 00:56:55,733
Hey.

807
00:56:55,733 --> 00:56:58,377
- I'm here.
- I want to eat ramen.

808
00:56:58,377 --> 00:57:00,013
Okay.

809
00:57:22,776 --> 00:57:24,476
Yummy.

810
00:57:24,476 --> 00:57:26,262
R-Really?

811
00:57:26,262 --> 00:57:28,653
Are you upset?

812
00:57:29,946 --> 00:57:35,023
Keeping his boss from starving is also one of the duties of an assistant.

813
00:57:35,023 --> 00:57:40,919
Technically, I think it's one of the responsibilities of a mother or a wife.

814
00:57:40,919 --> 00:57:42,260
Are you stupid?

815
00:57:42,260 --> 00:57:46,364
If you lie on the couch and demand your mother or wife to cook for you, you'll be punished.

816
00:57:46,364 --> 00:57:50,849
So I can only wield my power as a boss and ask my assistant to do it.

817
00:57:50,849 --> 00:57:52,689
Go ahead and eat.

818
00:57:54,224 --> 00:57:56,746
- I'll eat now.
- Go ahead.

819
00:58:06,144 --> 00:58:08,666
That post has been deleted.

820
00:58:08,666 --> 00:58:12,246
I mean the college student who wants to win the Kimura Ihei Award.

821
00:58:12,246 --> 00:58:15,395
I think he deleted it because he was ashamed.

822
00:58:15,395 --> 00:58:19,572
Shame is something that only young people would have.

823
00:58:24,872 --> 00:58:28,417
You haven't shown me your photography work recently.

824
00:58:29,158 --> 00:58:32,979
I... I didn't take any.

825
00:58:32,979 --> 00:58:36,340
Because you don't know what you want to shoot?

826
00:58:41,771 --> 00:58:45,880
Because there's someone who's much better than me.

827
00:58:48,547 --> 00:58:50,817
But I will not give up.

828
00:58:50,817 --> 00:58:53,677
I know I should stop thinking that way.

829
00:58:53,677 --> 00:58:59,101
I'm sorry for my shallowness and rudeness.

830
00:59:02,325 --> 00:59:05,785
It's got to be love.

831
00:59:06,602 --> 00:59:07,980
What?

832
00:59:07,980 --> 00:59:10,714
Once you are in love with something,

833
00:59:10,714 --> 00:59:13,934
you'll doubt yourself if you can show its beauty perfectly,

834
00:59:13,934 --> 00:59:17,752
be it people, animals, or scenery.

835
00:59:19,333 --> 00:59:21,413
You aren't confident in yourself, are you?

836
00:59:22,803 --> 00:59:23,919
No...

837
00:59:23,919 --> 00:59:27,844
You'll do it once you are confident enough, right?

838
00:59:27,844 --> 00:59:30,692
Well, it's not like that.

839
00:59:30,692 --> 00:59:34,411
I just...

840
00:59:34,411 --> 00:59:36,173
Want to shoot.

841
00:59:38,246 --> 00:59:40,703
Of course, you do.

842
00:59:40,703 --> 00:59:42,882
Your eyes give you away.

843
00:59:44,084 --> 00:59:47,035
Young artists tend to overthink like this.

844
00:59:47,035 --> 00:59:49,382
How charming.

845
00:59:51,027 --> 00:59:54,488
Please let me off.

846
00:59:54,488 --> 00:59:56,603
I used to be like this,

847
00:59:56,603 --> 01:00:01,278
being overconfident for no reason, thinking the world is meaningless,

848
01:00:01,278 --> 01:00:06,104
being angry with those useless people and wanting them all gone.

849
01:00:07,275 --> 01:00:10,747
But I'm nothing like that.

850
01:00:10,747 --> 01:00:16,198
Overconfidence and absence of confidence are both results of excessive self-awareness.

851
01:00:16,198 --> 01:00:18,508
Like the two sides of a piece of paper.

852
01:00:18,508 --> 01:00:21,628
It'll change as soon as the right opportunity presents itself.

853
01:00:22,666 --> 01:00:25,822
Have you had the same experience?

854
01:00:30,706 --> 01:00:32,553
I can't remember.

855
01:00:33,412 --> 01:00:35,161
Thank you for the ramen.

856
01:00:38,903 --> 01:00:40,811
If I'd known that college student would delete that post

857
01:00:40,811 --> 01:00:43,063
about winning the Kimura Ihei Award, I would've saved that page.

858
01:00:43,063 --> 01:00:45,884
Young people fear nothing indeed.

859
01:00:45,884 --> 01:00:49,516
How stupid.

860
01:00:49,516 --> 01:00:55,030
True, but it's something I've lost and can never get back anymore.

861
01:01:00,617 --> 01:01:02,965
What's this?

862
01:01:02,965 --> 01:01:05,585
What's wrong?

863
01:01:06,625 --> 01:01:08,224
It's the young actor I took photos of.

864
01:01:08,224 --> 01:01:11,418
Oh, you know him.

865
01:01:11,418 --> 01:01:13,480
- Kiyoi?
- Yes.

866
01:01:18,817 --> 01:01:26,717
[Anna's real boyfriend is an up-and-coming actor]
[Her relationship with Kiyoi Sou exposed]

867
01:01:37,377 --> 01:01:42,727
I failed to stop the news from being published. I'm so sorry.

868
01:01:42,727 --> 01:01:46,296
No. I was being too careless.

869
01:01:46,296 --> 01:01:49,789
I think it's a strategy they adopted to make the rumor go away

870
01:01:49,789 --> 01:01:52,052
and put us under the spotlight. That way,

871
01:01:52,052 --> 01:01:55,092
they can claim that the rumor about Kiriya-kun and Anna was a misunderstanding.

872
01:01:56,181 --> 01:02:01,429
This article doesn't even mention Kiriya-san.

873
01:02:01,429 --> 01:02:03,878
They've gone too far.

874
01:02:03,878 --> 01:02:08,927
But from their point of view, protecting Kiriya-kun is their priority.

875
01:02:08,927 --> 01:02:11,976
Even so, they totally put us on the spot.

876
01:02:11,976 --> 01:02:14,872
- We should—
- Is Kiriya-san

877
01:02:14,872 --> 01:02:17,732
okay with this solution?

878
01:02:19,963 --> 01:02:22,489
That we don't know.

879
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:40,760
[Fans all over the country were betrayed. Goodbye!]
[Both Anna and Kiyoi should quit the entertainment industry!]

880
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:44,430
[I would rush anywhere and anytime for Kiyoi-kun. I feel like a fool!]
[It's a matter of the agency's responsibility. Kiriya is not an idol, someone who can't even act isn't worth!]

881
01:02:44,430 --> 01:02:48,360
[I was always rooting for Kiyoi!]
[Celebrities' jobs are to show their dreams. Don't let them down!]

882
01:02:50,166 --> 01:02:53,284
Do I need to conduct an exorcism ritual?

883
01:02:53,284 --> 01:02:54,674
What?

884
01:02:56,850 --> 01:02:59,396
I took photos of Anna and Kiyoi Sou.

885
01:02:59,396 --> 01:03:02,638
Tomorrow, I'll take photos of Kiriya Keisuke.

886
01:03:08,295 --> 01:03:13,249
I don't want to be put in the middle of a love triangle.

887
01:03:13,249 --> 01:03:14,825
Noguchi-san.

888
01:03:14,825 --> 01:03:16,297
Yes?

889
01:03:16,297 --> 01:03:18,439
Could you do me a favor?

890
01:03:20,539 --> 01:03:21,674
Well...

891
01:03:21,674 --> 01:03:22,967
No.

892
01:03:22,967 --> 01:03:25,427
W-Wait. I haven't even said anything.

893
01:03:25,427 --> 01:03:27,800
I have a bad feeling about this. I don't want to hear it.

894
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:30,380
Besides, I don't need a favor from you, so it's a loss to me already.

895
01:03:30,380 --> 01:03:34,296
But cooking ramen is one of your duties as my assistant.

896
01:03:34,296 --> 01:03:36,428
Noguchi-san...

897
01:03:38,888 --> 01:03:41,954
Then crack me up.

898
01:03:41,954 --> 01:03:42,906
What?

899
01:03:42,906 --> 01:03:48,521
If you tell me a story that can make me laugh now, I'll agree to help you.

900
01:03:53,229 --> 01:03:54,674
You can't think of any, can you?

901
01:03:54,674 --> 01:03:56,920
Of course, you can't. You are Hira.

902
01:03:56,920 --> 01:03:58,666
All right, let's drop it then.

903
01:03:58,666 --> 01:04:02,748
The interesting college student who wants to win the Kimura Ihei Award...

904
01:04:04,642 --> 01:04:06,342
is me.

905
01:04:08,571 --> 01:04:10,771
Really?

906
01:04:10,777 --> 01:04:12,277
Really.

907
01:04:13,976 --> 01:04:18,004
What? It's you?

908
01:04:18,004 --> 01:04:19,460
Yes.

909
01:04:24,579 --> 01:04:28,594
Hold on. Hold on.

910
01:04:29,930 --> 01:04:34,070
[As expected! I guess that!]

911
01:04:34,070 --> 01:04:37,870
[What a life Koyoi had. Poor him!]

912
01:04:39,951 --> 01:04:43,345
No matter how sweet the words are,

913
01:04:43,345 --> 01:04:46,251
they can turn into hatred in a blink of an eye.

914
01:04:48,520 --> 01:04:50,020
Forget it.

915
01:04:50,904 --> 01:04:53,124
It's not worth it worrying about these things.

916
01:05:02,607 --> 01:05:07,153
[Can I call you?]

917
01:05:47,515 --> 01:05:50,127
Why can't I stand aside and watch?

918
01:05:50,127 --> 01:05:55,789
I just want to talk to Kiriya-kun alone.

919
01:05:55,789 --> 01:05:59,531
Photoshoots are not just about appearance,

920
01:05:59,531 --> 01:06:03,951
it's about expressing inner thoughts, which is the most important part.

921
01:06:03,951 --> 01:06:08,444
Even so, you've never said that before.

922
01:06:08,444 --> 01:06:11,441
Just do want Noguchi-san says.

923
01:06:11,441 --> 01:06:14,911
No matter what,

924
01:06:16,547 --> 01:06:20,069
I want him to be my photographer.

925
01:06:21,508 --> 01:06:23,416
I see.

926
01:06:24,357 --> 01:06:26,755
Sorry if we offended you.

927
01:06:27,904 --> 01:06:29,942
Thank you.

928
01:06:31,650 --> 01:06:36,445
It's all right. It's been a long time since I last shot you.

929
01:06:37,825 --> 01:06:41,266
Why do you want to take photos at times like this?

930
01:06:44,444 --> 01:06:47,649
No need to answer. I'll know when I start shooting.

931
01:06:55,224 --> 01:06:57,290
So mysterious.

932
01:06:57,290 --> 01:07:02,374
Stay quiet even if you are surprised, okay?

933
01:07:02,374 --> 01:07:03,874
Okay.

934
01:07:08,724 --> 01:07:14,470
Actually, someone wants to see you.

935
01:07:16,092 --> 01:07:19,073
I hope it's also the one whom you want to see the most.

936
01:07:19,073 --> 01:07:20,447
What?

937
01:07:32,042 --> 01:07:34,079
Huh?

938
01:07:34,079 --> 01:07:35,928
No, no. Not me.

939
01:07:35,928 --> 01:07:37,691
It's her.

940
01:08:05,467 --> 01:08:07,367
Kiriya-kun.

941
01:08:15,840 --> 01:08:17,735
I missed you so much.

942
01:08:22,135 --> 01:08:23,735
Sorry.

943
01:08:25,963 --> 01:08:28,024
I'm so sorry.

944
01:08:39,270 --> 01:08:41,687
I'm negotiating with my agency.

945
01:08:43,984 --> 01:08:45,590
I...

946
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:50,400
will not break up with you.

947
01:08:52,768 --> 01:08:56,256
If my agency doesn't agree,

948
01:08:59,432 --> 01:09:02,127
I'll quit the show biz.

949
01:09:02,127 --> 01:09:04,573
No, don't.

950
01:09:04,573 --> 01:09:10,206
I won't leave you, no matter what.

951
01:09:12,354 --> 01:09:14,330
I won't leave you, either.

952
01:09:16,782 --> 01:09:19,378
But I don't want to give up on my acting career.

953
01:09:22,905 --> 01:09:25,482
I love you,

954
01:09:27,172 --> 01:09:29,452
but I'm also passionate about acting.

955
01:09:33,001 --> 01:09:35,250
Please forgive me for my willfulness.

956
01:09:38,238 --> 01:09:41,570
But what you just said

957
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:44,740
gave me the strength to live.

958
01:09:47,081 --> 01:09:52,303
Because you are the star in my heart.

959
01:10:19,953 --> 01:10:22,186
Anything I can help with?

960
01:10:23,571 --> 01:10:26,922
It's okay. I can handle it.

961
01:10:26,922 --> 01:10:28,467
Okay.

962
01:10:32,554 --> 01:10:35,513
One can survive solely on someone's promise.

963
01:10:36,468 --> 01:10:38,348
That's incredible.

964
01:10:39,096 --> 01:10:43,515
Because they are both suffering from the pain of missing each other,

965
01:10:45,176 --> 01:10:48,505
and they can't live without each other.

966
01:10:54,397 --> 01:10:55,997
Kiyoi.

967
01:10:56,654 --> 01:10:58,154
Yes?

968
01:10:59,090 --> 01:11:00,903
I have something to say to you.

969
01:11:03,399 --> 01:11:05,969
I'll wait for you at the old place.

970
01:11:20,044 --> 01:11:23,135
Are you Kiyoi Sou?

971
01:11:37,484 --> 01:11:39,384
Where am I?

972
01:11:53,039 --> 01:11:54,639
You woke up.

973
01:11:58,775 --> 01:12:00,911
I'm talking to you.

974
01:12:06,307 --> 01:12:10,780
I just called Anna on your phone.

975
01:12:12,081 --> 01:12:14,411
The news are wrong about Anna and me.

976
01:12:14,411 --> 01:12:16,873
We are just friends.

977
01:12:17,616 --> 01:12:19,116
What?

978
01:12:21,047 --> 01:12:24,698
You two got a room together.

979
01:12:24,698 --> 01:12:27,090
We were only talking.

980
01:12:29,285 --> 01:12:31,951
That's so lame.

981
01:12:31,951 --> 01:12:34,443
Is the truth.

982
01:12:36,888 --> 01:12:40,309
No matter what, you can't be with her.

983
01:12:40,309 --> 01:12:44,692
A third-rate actor like you doesn't deserve Anna.

984
01:12:49,134 --> 01:12:53,106
I've always trusted Anna, and I also want to trust her this time.

985
01:12:53,969 --> 01:12:56,515
I even forgave Kiriya,

986
01:12:57,483 --> 01:13:00,074
although I can't believe Anna is dating such a stupid actor.

987
01:13:00,074 --> 01:13:02,202
I was so disappointed.

988
01:13:05,648 --> 01:13:09,825
But since Anna has devoted herself to acting since she was a teenager,

989
01:13:09,825 --> 01:13:12,589
she deserves to have some fun.

990
01:13:12,589 --> 01:13:16,924
It is our responsibility as fans to show our support.

991
01:13:17,944 --> 01:13:19,744
But now,

992
01:13:22,728 --> 01:13:28,053
she's actually going out with a rookie actor who has nothing but a pretty face.

993
01:13:28,877 --> 01:13:31,460
She let her fans down completely

994
01:13:31,460 --> 01:13:35,496
so we must let her realize her mistake.

995
01:13:35,496 --> 01:13:38,407
I must tell her in person.

996
01:13:40,510 --> 01:13:42,774
Don't be cocky so soon.

997
01:13:44,869 --> 01:13:47,600
You don't understand this feeling, do you?

998
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:50,649
Fools will never understand.

999
01:13:51,518 --> 01:13:56,679
Wait, that person may understand.

1000
01:13:58,359 --> 01:14:03,095
He's your fan, a freak.

1001
01:14:03,095 --> 01:14:04,571
What?

1002
01:14:06,027 --> 01:14:10,374
He's just like me.

1003
01:14:19,321 --> 01:14:21,221
Hello?

1004
01:14:22,410 --> 01:14:24,210
Anna-san?

1005
01:14:26,201 --> 01:14:29,669
What happened to Kiyoi?

1006
01:15:10,703 --> 01:15:14,684
Don't you dare compare yourself with him!

1007
01:15:16,478 --> 01:15:19,314
He's a righteous man.

1008
01:15:20,316 --> 01:15:25,872
He's selfless and always put me first.

1009
01:15:27,992 --> 01:15:32,696
Compared to him, your arrogance is worth nothing.

1010
01:15:34,431 --> 01:15:36,270
Why are you looking at me like that?

1011
01:15:36,270 --> 01:15:38,620
Are you looking down on me?

1012
01:15:45,516 --> 01:15:48,158
Stop looking at me like that.

1013
01:15:58,309 --> 01:15:59,809
Hira.

1014
01:16:05,952 --> 01:16:07,407
Hira.

1015
01:16:07,407 --> 01:16:09,507
Hira.

1016
01:16:09,507 --> 01:16:11,359
Hey, Hira.

1017
01:16:12,432 --> 01:16:14,032
Hira.

1018
01:16:14,834 --> 01:16:16,377
Hira.

1019
01:16:16,377 --> 01:16:18,457
Hira.

1020
01:16:23,507 --> 01:16:25,007
Kiyoi.

1021
01:16:27,025 --> 01:16:29,151
Are... Are you okay?

1022
01:16:29,151 --> 01:16:30,433
What took you so long?

1023
01:16:30,433 --> 01:16:32,942
Let me untie you.

1024
01:16:36,489 --> 01:16:39,312
Hira-kun, you understand me, don't you?

1025
01:16:40,810 --> 01:16:46,081
Anna is the only proof of my existence.

1026
01:16:48,571 --> 01:16:53,483
Once you start to impose your own will on her, you are no longer her fan.

1027
01:16:53,483 --> 01:16:56,031
I only want Kiyoi to live happily.

1028
01:16:56,031 --> 01:16:58,497
I don't need him to prove anything to me.

1029
01:17:00,252 --> 01:17:01,952
Enough.

1030
01:17:03,728 --> 01:17:09,482
Anna, Kiyoi Sou, and Kiriya Keisuke.

1031
01:17:10,335 --> 01:17:12,719
I'll send them all to hell.

1032
01:17:15,911 --> 01:17:22,185
If you dare to hurt Kiyoi, I'll kill you.

1033
01:17:25,014 --> 01:17:26,914
Kiyoi, let's go.

1034
01:17:34,058 --> 01:17:37,550
Kiyoi, get out of here.

1035
01:17:37,550 --> 01:17:39,746
- Come with me.
- Stop talking, just go.

1036
01:17:39,746 --> 01:17:40,825
Kiyoi, run.

1037
01:17:40,825 --> 01:17:44,141
- No.
- Shut up! Run!

1038
01:17:51,140 --> 01:17:56,780
♫ It's natural, if the bright red rain falls the clouds scatter ♫

1039
01:17:56,780 --> 01:18:02,440
♫ I adore you like an osmanthus, I love you so much ♫

1040
01:18:02,440 --> 01:18:08,050
♫ I'm sure it's a mistake, but still I want to look
up at you, I want to touch you ♫

1041
01:18:08,050 --> 01:18:13,430
♫ I'm even willing to die like this, savoring
the sweetness of wanting you ♫

1042
01:18:13,430 --> 01:18:18,590
♫ Never enough photos of you
I'll keep yearning for absolute beauty ♫

1043
01:18:18,590 --> 01:18:23,120
♫ Is there a word for this contradiction? ♫

1044
01:18:24,970 --> 01:18:30,680
♫ I couldn't love anyone other than you,
I just can't imagine this scenery ♫

1045
01:18:30,680 --> 01:18:36,310
♫ You are as unreachable as the moon,
this has always made me sad ♫

1046
01:18:36,310 --> 01:18:42,050
♫ Even if you claim you'll resist,
there is something I cannot let go of ♫

1047
01:18:42,050 --> 01:18:45,820
♫ I'll tell you hundreds of millions of times ♫

1048
01:18:45,822 --> 01:18:47,622
Kiyoi.

1049
01:18:47,622 --> 01:18:49,540
♫ If you push back, ♫

1050
01:18:49,541 --> 01:18:52,541
Kiyoi.

1051
01:18:52,541 --> 01:18:57,030
♫ This is the first time I've felt this way ♫

1052
01:19:01,105 --> 01:19:06,047
I may have ascended to heaven.

1053
01:19:07,762 --> 01:19:12,746
I had such a lovely dream.

1054
01:19:12,746 --> 01:19:14,488
Kiyoi.

1055
01:19:15,938 --> 01:19:17,746
Kiyoi.

1056
01:19:40,738 --> 01:19:45,617
Kiyoi is crying like a baby.

1057
01:19:45,617 --> 01:19:49,898
His face is covered in tears.

1058
01:19:49,898 --> 01:19:51,424
Although...

1059
01:19:51,424 --> 01:19:53,030
Hira.

1060
01:19:53,030 --> 01:19:57,162
his beauty is still to die for.

1061
01:20:00,227 --> 01:20:04,131
- The ambulance is here. He'll be fine.
- Let go of me.

1062
01:20:05,767 --> 01:20:11,065
I can't live without you.

1063
01:20:11,065 --> 01:20:12,843
Let go of me.

1064
01:20:12,843 --> 01:20:17,555
Kiyoi asked me to stay with him.

1065
01:20:17,555 --> 01:20:20,229
I couldn't wish for anything better.

1066
01:20:22,150 --> 01:20:25,278
I'd rest in peace if I died.

1067
01:20:37,577 --> 01:20:44,421
But fate pulled me back to reality

1068
01:20:44,421 --> 01:20:47,927
so I can continue my duty in the service of the king.

1069
01:20:47,927 --> 01:20:49,627
Kazu-kun.

1070
01:20:51,430 --> 01:20:53,230
Naho-chan.

1071
01:20:56,922 --> 01:21:00,461
How did I get here?

1072
01:21:00,461 --> 01:21:04,035
You bumped your head when you fell.

1073
01:21:06,811 --> 01:21:08,035
Oh, where's Kiyoi?

1074
01:21:08,035 --> 01:21:10,893
Don't worry. He's fine.

1075
01:21:10,893 --> 01:21:12,693
Just stay here and rest.

1076
01:21:15,286 --> 01:21:18,663
Kiyoi-kun has been here keeping you company.

1077
01:21:22,175 --> 01:21:24,238
That person...

1078
01:21:24,238 --> 01:21:26,597
The attacker is alive.

1079
01:21:28,759 --> 01:21:32,558
He stabbed himself by accident during the fight.

1080
01:21:32,558 --> 01:21:34,638
The whole thing was kind of ridiculous.

You should stay with Kiyoi-kun.

Naho-chan.

1088
01:22:01,936 --> 01:22:06,003
After you were hurt, Kiyoi-kun kept crying...

1089
01:22:07,691 --> 01:22:09,946
and said he wanted to stay with you.

1090
01:22:11,644 --> 01:22:14,426
Kiyoi kept saying that.

1091
01:22:14,426 --> 01:22:17,816
I asked him if you were his friend.

1092
01:22:17,816 --> 01:22:20,210
He said you weren't

1093
01:22:20,210 --> 01:22:24,939

[Ins and outs about Kiyoi Sou's kidnapping case]

1096
01:22:42,919 --> 01:22:44,501
This thing has escalated to a criminal case.

1097
01:22:44,501 --> 01:22:50,656
All the criticism of Anna and Kiyoi died down instantly.

1098
01:22:50,656 --> 01:22:54,910
But the coverage that lasted for days has caught the attention of the public.

1099
01:22:54,910 --> 01:22:56,877
The relationship between a popular actress and an idol actor

1100
01:22:56,877 --> 01:23:01,131
led to a fanatical fan kidnapping the rumored boyfriend of the actress.

1101
01:23:01,131 --> 01:23:05,285
The unscrupulous media must take the blame.

1102
01:23:05,285 --> 01:23:08,320
By the way, is Anna okay?

1103
01:23:08,320 --> 01:23:10,760
She feels very sorry.

1104
01:23:10,760 --> 01:23:13,362
After all, it's one of her fans.

1105
01:23:14,137 --> 01:23:17,549
And it's still uncertain when she can come back to work, right?

1106
01:23:17,549 --> 01:23:23,742
Kiriya's agency called us.

1107
01:23:27,163 --> 01:23:32,583
They want to make peace with us.

1108
01:23:32,583 --> 01:23:34,382
What?

1109
01:23:34,382 --> 01:23:39,067
I didn't expect they'd use photos to announce their relationship.

1110
01:23:39,067 --> 01:23:40,551
Neither did I.

1111
01:23:40,551 --> 01:23:44,240
Maybe it's for the best.

1112
01:23:46,903 --> 01:23:50,520

It's okay.

1118

It's better to have the misunderstanding solved sooner rather than later.

1120

Forget about that.

1133

If you do, you should publish an album or host a photography exhibit first.

01:37:44,525 --> 01:37:48,240
I'll follow in Kiyoi's footsteps and find him,

1262
01:37:48,240 --> 01:37:50,566
fall in love with him over and over.

1263
01:38:00,225 --> 01:38:05,659
This is my... eternal love for him.

1264
01:38:39,555 --> 01:38:41,055
I think...

1265
01:38:43,540 --> 01:38:46,903
you've got me head over heels in love.

1266
01:38:49,080 --> 01:38:50,780
Kiyoi.

1267
01:39:09,579 --> 01:39:14,926
Spring, summer, winter, autumn...

1268
01:39:15,864 --> 01:39:17,992
alternate nonstop.

1269
01:39:17,992 --> 01:39:21,852
Life is full of uncertainties.

1270
01:39:22,594 --> 01:39:27,873
But I'll stay with Kiyoi,

1271
01:39:29,525 --> 01:39:31,848
the perfect king, forever.

1272
01:39:40,719 --> 01:39:42,219
No,

1273
01:39:46,979 --> 01:39:48,779
he's mine.

1274
01:39:48,779 --> 01:39:50,614
My only...

1275
01:39:54,305 --> 01:39:56,574
beautiful man.

01:39:58,034 --> 01:40:02,680
[My Beautiful Man - Eternal | He is so Beautiful]

♫ I want to be loved, my love is withering ♫

1278
01:40:07,530 --> 01:40:11,040
♫ I want to be part of your world ♫

1279
01:40:11,040 --> 01:40:16,470
♫ Meet me in your dreams and fall in love with you ♫

1280
01:40:16,470 --> 01:40:21,010
♫ I want to breathe with the same love ♫

1281
01:40:29,590 --> 01:40:33,820
♫ My clumsiness keeps getting in the way ♫

1282
01:40:33,820 --> 01:40:38,620
♫ I'm waiting for one word ♫

1283
01:40:38,620 --> 01:40:42,810
♫ A relationship that is less than loving ♫

1284
01:40:42,810 --> 01:40:47,550
♫ Can you promise it forever? ♫

1285
01:40:47,550 --> 01:40:51,780
♫ Steal my heart without permission ♫

1286
01:40:51,780 --> 01:40:56,550
♫ Despite I'm shy, I fall in love with you ♫

1287
01:40:56,550 --> 01:41:01,320
♫ I want to be captured by this beautiful love ♫

1288
01:41:01,320 --> 01:41:04,850
♫ Run away, right now ♫

1289
01:41:04,850 --> 01:41:10,270
♫ I want more of your scent, your gestures and your voice ♫

1290
01:41:10,270 --> 01:41:15,140
♫ It's the shape of love until it turns to ashes ♫

1291
01:41:25,690 --> 01:41:29,920
♫ Swirling red thread of fate ♫

1292
01:41:29,920 --> 01:41:34,620
♫ It's so intertwined that we can't unravel ♫

1293
01:41:34,620 --> 01:41:38,820
♫ Pull me together with your hands ♫

1294
01:41:38,820 --> 01:41:43,520
♫ Could you please tie me to you? ♫

1295
01:41:43,520 --> 01:41:47,840
♫ Chase me cheekily ♫

1296
01:41:47,840 --> 01:41:52,600
♫ I was attracted to you, take responsibility ♫

1297
01:41:52,600 --> 01:41:57,340
♫ I can't tell you "keep touching me" ♫

1298
01:41:57,340 --> 01:42:00,940
♫ I want something ordinary ♫

1299
01:42:00,940 --> 01:42:06,320
♫ My heart leaps every time our lips touch each other ♫

1300
01:42:06,320 --> 01:42:10,860
♫ Make it stop as many times as you like ♫

1301
01:42:10,860 --> 01:42:15,560
♫ A distance that is intricately entangled ♫

1302
01:42:15,560 --> 01:42:19,780
♫ As far away as you want ♫

1303
01:42:19,780 --> 01:42:23,640
♫ The osmanthus' scent ♫

1304
01:42:23,640 --> 01:42:28,460
♫ make it unbearable ♫

1305
01:42:28,460 --> 01:42:33,330
♫ I want to be loved, my love is withering ♫

1306
01:42:33,330 --> 01:42:36,810
♫ I want to know everything about you ♫

1307
01:42:36,810 --> 01:42:42,220
♫ Even if our ideals crumble, our feelings are unwavering ♫

1308
01:42:42,220 --> 01:42:46,750
♫ The meaning of being born is by my side ♫

1309
01:42:46,750 --> 01:42:52,070
♫ Let me drown you deep inside my heart ♫

1310
01:43:00,180 --> 01:43:06,820
♫ Take me to eternity ♫
