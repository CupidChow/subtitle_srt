1
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:07,040
There are no coincidences.

2
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,010
Everything happens

3
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:20,640
for a reason.

4
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:25,940
(Dear My Name)

5
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:30,070
Sundae soup.

6
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,450
Cheeseburger.

7
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:34,530
I want to put a bowl of rice
in mala soup.

8
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:36,490
No, pizza is better.

9
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:37,580
Honey.

10
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:41,540
What are you looking at?

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,960
You see,

12
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:49,670
my neck was sore.

13
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,340
There are so many people here.

14
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:53,680
Watch what you say.

15
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,100
Why do you care

16
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:57,390
if I call her

17
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:58,640
honey or sweetie?

18
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:00,770
Well...

19
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:03,270
Is she your lover or something?

20
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:04,480
Cut it out.

21
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:06,730
Do you know this?

22
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:09,610
-Name fortune-telling.
-"Name fortune-telling"?

23
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:11,320
You weren't studying in class,
were you?

24
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:12,780
You are indeed correct.

25
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:13,950
Do you want to try it?

26
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:17,080
I do.

27
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:18,450
So...

28
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:21,660
Have you done it?

29
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:22,790
I did it with Joo Seong.

30
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,000
I thought

31
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:26,960
you guys broke up?

32
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:29,300
That's true.

33
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:30,630
(Jae Ha Yoo, Ji Woo Jeong,
18 points)

34
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,010
Darn it.

35
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:34,840
I got 18 points.

36
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,390
18 points, it is.

37
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:40,310
That's Jae Ha.

38
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:42,390
What?

39
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:44,060
Do you know him?

40
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:45,440
Yes.

41
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:47,860
He's our new housemate.

42
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:49,730
Let me see his Instagram.
What's his name?

43
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:51,190
Jae Ha Yoo.

44
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:53,360
Even his name is...

45
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:54,780
"Jae Ha Yoo"?

46
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:57,870
That "Jae Ha Yoo"?

47
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,910
I have class,
so I should go now.

48
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,500
-Bye.
-Bye.

49
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:07,170
He is your house-mate?
Are you serious?

50
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:11,170
Yes, he lives in the room
next to mine.

51
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,680
We even had breakfast together.

52
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:25,440
-Did you sleep well?
-Yes.

53
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:27,060
Ji Woo,
what's your plan for the day?

54
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:30,320
I have an assignment to do,
but it's not urgent.

55
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:33,690
Thank you for the meal.

56
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,530
Why didn't he finish his?

57
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,240
Eat up, will you?

58
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,410
Are you sure you didn't see
your name on him?

59
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:47,960
I thought he'd have my name
on his arm as well,

60
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:49,710
but he didn't.

61
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,130
Then

62
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:53,710
why did your name sparkle?

63
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:56,470
Maybe it's broken.

64
00:02:58,590 --> 00:02:59,720
Darn it.

65
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,390
Where in the world
is Jae Ha Yoo?

66
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:05,350
Forget it. Just find a guy
who likes you.

67
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,560
Don't just wait
for your man to come to you.

68
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,110
You're right. What's so great
about having a name?

69
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,240
You know I have
many followers online, right?

70
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,700
-Of course.
-I'll make a list

71
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,820
of all the decent guys,

72
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,820
-so you just wait.
-Okay.

73
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,240
Okay.

74
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:29,170
I keep thinking about him.

75
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:37,920
Jae Ha.

76
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:40,970
Give me a kiss.

77
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:52,650
Jae Ha, can you take
a photo for me?

78
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:58,320
Wake up, Jae Ha.

79
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:02,870
The more I think about him,

80
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:06,580
the more I notice him.

81
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:19,380
The more I notice him,

82
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,680
the more he bothers me.

83
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:26,930
I know it's not him,

84
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,810
but I can't stop myself
from anticipating.

85
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:37,110
Are you the one who's helping
Han Gyeol with his project?

86
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:43,320
Yes, it's me. Ji Woo Jeong.
Ji Woo Jeong.

87
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,830
Could you take one
from the front side?

88
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,120
Okay.

89
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,250
I need to give up.

90
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:57,630
He's not the one who wronged me.

91
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,210
It's this name.

92
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:03,090
I heard you were
quite competent.

93
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,390
Is that...

94
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:07,060
"You"? "Mr. Yoo"?

95
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:10,350
How should I address you?

96
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:15,020
Just address me like
you'd address your brother.

97
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,570
He really doesn't want us
to become close.

98
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:20,650
I'll take care of that.

99
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:23,570
Please take one from over here.

100
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:26,200
I think this one's a bit bent.

101
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:28,200
The more I notice him,

102
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,450
the more he bothers me.

103
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:36,000
Jae Ha.

104
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:37,840
I don't bite.

105
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:42,670
Can you please stop avoiding me?
We live under the same roof.

106
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:45,140
I never avoided you.

107
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:48,680
I'm sorry.

108
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,600
I mistook you as my soulmate.

109
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,440
Just forget what happened.
That's for the best.

110
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:00,980
You're finally looking at me.

111
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:04,110
You always had your head down
so that I couldn't see.

112
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:10,700
I have something
to apologize for.

113
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,210
About last night...

114
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:16,420
"Last night"?

115
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,000
After we drank...

116
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:21,090
-At night...
-"At night"?

117
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:24,170
I

118
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:30,060
stepped on you.

119
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:36,060
What?

120
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,980
No wonder.

121
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:42,360
My entire body was sore
as if I fell from somewhere.

122
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,740
I'm sorry about that.

123
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:46,860
Did you do something to me
last night?

124
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:51,080
What did you do?

125
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:53,500
-My gosh.
-My gosh.

126
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,710
When did you become so close?

127
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:56,830
We're not.

128
00:06:57,170 --> 00:06:59,290
Don't talk nonsense
when you're late.

129
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,710
I'm sorry.

130
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:03,340
Good job, you guys.

131
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,800
Keep doing a good job for me,
okay?

132
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,470
I prefer food over beverages.

133
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:08,550
Don't drink it, then.

134
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,300
Give me one sip.

135
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:12,640
My gosh.

136
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:14,560
-One sip.
-No.

137
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,730
Don't drink that.

138
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:19,310
Why not?

139
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:25,240
Germs. Germs are everywhere,
you know?

140
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:27,070
Han Gyeol.

141
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,240
Don't you still need my help?

142
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:30,740
I'll do it right now.

143
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,030
I'm done with that.

144
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,370
Did he call me a germ?

145
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:38,370
Why did I mention germs
back there?

146
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:39,750
Jae Ha.

147
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:40,920
Why?

148
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,210
Why would I say that?

149
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:43,250
Jae Ha.

150
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:44,960
Yes?

151
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:49,352
What is wrong
with your assignment?

152
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:52,970
I told you to take photos
of buildings.

153
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:54,890
Aren't these photos
too abstract?

154
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:57,520
-I'm sorry.
-Take new ones for tomorrow.

155
00:07:57,850 --> 00:07:59,640
Your score will be deducted.

156
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,900
For the final exam...

157
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:05,030
I needed to get to the bottom
of this.

158
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,200
I had to figure out
if it was my name

159
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:12,700
or my fluttering heart that
I wanted to hide.

160
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:22,330
My dream soulmate

161
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,000
became a reality

162
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,500
and came into my life.

163
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:28,550
And then,

164
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:30,430
he and I

165
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:32,890
were trapped

166
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,010
in this fate-like coincidence.

167
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:39,480
It happened

168
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:40,980
just now.

169
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:53,030
I need to find out

170
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:55,160
why I'm feeling this way.

171
00:08:58,750 --> 00:08:59,830
And I have finally

172
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:01,500
found out.

173
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:05,090
There are those times

174
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,590
when you get to know
someone by chance,

175
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:09,670
run into someone by accident,

176
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,090
and fall in love

177
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:14,300
by accident.

178
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:17,680
It seemed like a coincidence
yet it wasn't.

179
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:20,730
And like so,
you permeated into my life.

180
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:21,690
(Next story)

181
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:22,690
How does it feel for your name

182
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:24,350
to sparkle for the first time
in five years?

183
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:25,940
It feels awesome.

184
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,690
I'm going to confess to the girl I like.

185
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:32,580
Do you think a name can solve everything?

186
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:35,890
In love, one solution is better than none.

187
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:47,880
Jae Ha.

188
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,880
Jae Ha.

189
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:52,070
Yes?

190
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:54,040
What is wrong
with your assignment?

191
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:57,410
(When a guy likes a guy /
When a guy's soulmate)

192
00:09:57,580 --> 00:27:17,130
(is a guy / Male couples /
Male-on-male names)
