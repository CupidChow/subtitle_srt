1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,718
Didn't you say
you'd confess to the one you like?

2
00:00:02,119 --> 00:00:03,453
Not yet.

3
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:06,123
Great. Neither did I.

4
00:00:06,256 --> 00:00:09,320
What's great about it?

5
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:14,130
(Dear My Name)

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,660
I found out that the person
I thought was a guy

7
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:18,780
turned out to be a girl.

8
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:20,660
How should I address you?

9
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:22,040
Just address me like
you'd address your brother.

10
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,000
What do you think
about a guy liking another guy?

11
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,080
What?

12
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:30,960
I found out everything.

13
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:32,880
But because of that,

14
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:35,880
I can't do anything.

15
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,810
Bad morning.

16
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:46,770
Bad morning.

17
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:50,060
Is no one home?

18
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:51,650
They all left just now.

19
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:53,530
Did they go together?

20
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:54,610
Yes.

21
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:57,030
Han Gyeol went to work
on his graduation project,

22
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:58,490
and Ji Woo is helping him out.

23
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:01,580
Hey.

24
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:03,910
Why is life so hard?

25
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:05,120
-I know, right?
-Never mind.

26
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,410
Sae Rom is the worst.

27
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,330
I confessed to her.

28
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:10,330
-Lucky you.
-Not at all.

29
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:12,040
I'm pretty sure I was rejected.

30
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:14,170
It's much better than me
who can't even confess.

31
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:17,550
Sure. I may have sounded
too vague.

32
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:18,800
That's understandable.

33
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,930
But still, we've spent
so many years together.

34
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:23,310
She should've understood me.

35
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:25,560
Right, but it was impossible
to understand.

36
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,980
Never mind, she may
have feigned ignorance.

37
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:30,060
What's the point
when I already said no?

38
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:33,360
I'm such an idiot.

39
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,480
Such an idiot.

40
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,530
-What?
-What?

41
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,280
Me?

42
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:41,910
What did I say?

43
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:42,990
You said I was an idiot.

44
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:49,500
Come out. I'm in the park
in front of your house.

45
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:51,790
I'll be back.

46
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:53,840
Okay.

47
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,210
Bye. Go.

48
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:58,800
Everyone left me.

49
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:04,060
What do you think
about a guy liking another guy?

50
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:08,190
Ji Woo, could you tie my apron?

51
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:10,480
-Okay.
-Hurry, hurry!

52
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,070
Come on, now.

53
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:19,410
-Feed me some snacks.
-What?

54
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:20,620
Feed me.

55
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:24,080
Here.

56
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:27,040
There you go.

57
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:30,830
I see.

58
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:34,120
Ji Woo, what are you thinking about?

59
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:35,330
Thanks.

60
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:36,710
No problem.

61
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:39,210
What's gotten into you?
You'd always complain

62
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:41,000
when I asked for your help.

63
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,750
But today,
you volunteered to help out.

64
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,960
Just because.

65
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,470
I'm not comfortable
being home these days.

66
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:50,050
It was much better
when it was just us three.

67
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,300
Should I tell Jae Ha
to move out?

68
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:53,510
What?

69
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:54,970
Don't be so startled.

70
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:00,690
I don't know whether
you're sharp-witted

71
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:02,190
or slow-witted.

72
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:04,610
What do you mean?

73
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:07,780
Never mind. It's just that

74
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:09,610
I'm jealous.

75
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:17,080
I found out

76
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,870
that someone close to me

77
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:22,790
likes someone I like.

78
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:25,500
I'm going to confess
to the girl I like.

79
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:26,760
Give me a sip.

80
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,130
Goodness.

81
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:34,970
Beer sounds good.

82
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:42,480
Jae Ha, where are you going?

83
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:46,900
I'm about to have dinner.

84
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,690
Do you want to have it together?

85
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,250
Jae Ha.

86
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,250
Did you confess yet?

87
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:04,500
You were going to confess
to someone you like.

88
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:10,050
No, not yet.

89
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:12,590
That's a relief.

90
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:14,220
I haven't either.

91
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:17,560
Why is that a relief?

92
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,730
I should do it before you do.

93
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:24,520
So...

94
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:27,360
I like him.

95
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:30,740
But he likes him.

96
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,240
But he likes...

97
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,740
(Ji Woo, Jae Ha, Han Gyeol)

98
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:41,290
Come out. I'm in the park
in front of your house.

99
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:48,590
What is it? Why are you here?

100
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,510
No one's here. Not even Ji Woo.

101
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:57,300
I wanted to see something.

102
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,730
Me?

103
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:10,940
That was sudden.

104
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,070
I thought you had rejected me...

105
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:17,950
That's it?

106
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:23,500
Sit down.

107
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:25,290
I really wanted to watch this.

108
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:30,710
Hey.

109
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:32,800
What is it?

110
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,510
Their performance will end
in five minutes.

111
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:37,720
So give me an answer
in five minutes.

112
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,220
Was that a confession?

113
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,440
Well... That was...

114
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,480
Answer me.

115
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:51,070
So...

116
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:57,570
That was...

117
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:19,760
Well...

118
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,180
Hey.

119
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:23,180
Are you stupid?

120
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,730
Stop trying to keep your pride.

121
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,570
Your time is over.

122
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:35,990
You missed your timing.

123
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:53,090
Waiting for your soulmate

124
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,380
is like having a crush
on someone for a long time.

125
00:06:58,260 --> 00:06:59,430
And I have a crush

126
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,350
on someone else

127
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:04,810
other than my soulmate.

128
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,150
No one's home.

129
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:18,610
No.

130
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,990
Ji Woo went to school.

131
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,950
I don't know
where Han Gyeol went.

132
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,240
She went to school?

133
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:25,660
At this hour?

134
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,120
Well...

135
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,330
She liked that it was empty.

136
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:31,460
She'd go there whenever
she had a lot on her mind.

137
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:34,920
I heard
it was going to rain tonight.

138
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:37,630
I missed my timing.

139
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:44,850
Just like forgetting

140
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:47,220
to bring your umbrella
on a rainy day,

141
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,940
have you ever missed your timing

142
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:53,940
because you were acting
like a fool?

143
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:56,270
Yes.

144
00:07:58,650 --> 00:07:59,740
Right now.

145
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:07,540
Han Gyeol.

146
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:09,660
You weren't home.

147
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:12,250
I knew you'd be here all alone.

148
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,920
If you knew I wanted
to be alone,

149
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:16,630
you shouldn't have come.

150
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,760
Han Gyeol.

151
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:26,640
The person I like

152
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:29,390
likes a guy.

153
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:31,440
Isn't that funny?

154
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,940
It's a lie. Mine...

155
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:37,570
Mine is right here.

156
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:39,570
But I realized
the important thing is

157
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:43,200
about liking that person,
whether it's a guy or a girl.

158
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,910
I found myself liking him.

159
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,160
I was completely shocked.

160
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,120
I was utterly rejected.

161
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,500
Gosh, you two...

162
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:02,720
So what's your plan?

163
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,630
I'm not sure.

164
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:06,970
Maybe I should root
for his happiness.

165
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:09,680
What should I do?
I don't like men.

166
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:14,690
-How did you...
-I like you more than him.

167
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:21,690
I like you.

168
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:25,810
The guy my soulmate likes...

169
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:27,810
He

170
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,980
likes me?

171
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:31,250
I said I like you.

172
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,625
I don't care if you have my name.
I like you, anyway.

173
00:09:35,725 --> 00:09:37,327
The name on me disappeared.

174
00:09:37,427 --> 00:09:39,529
You only gave me five minutes to talk.

175
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:42,060
How and what should I say?

176
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:56,640
This is a way for me
to regain my timing.

177
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:59,440
This is the only thing

178
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,440
I can do as of now.
