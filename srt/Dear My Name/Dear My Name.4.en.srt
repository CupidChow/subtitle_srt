1
00:00:00,709 --> 00:00:02,586
I'm going to confess
to the girl I like.

2
00:00:03,337 --> 00:00:04,379
Me too.

3
00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:06,757
I'm going to confess
to someone I like.

4
00:00:11,929 --> 00:00:13,889
(Dear My Name)

5
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:15,682
Ji Woo, look here.

6
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:18,101
You said you wouldn't shoot
my face. Stop it.

7
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:20,020
I have to do an interview.

8
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,480
Help me out.

9
00:00:21,647 --> 00:00:23,148
How does it feel for your name

10
00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:24,650
to sparkle for the first time
in five years?

11
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:27,736
At first, I was disappointed
that he doesn't have my name.

12
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:30,906
It feels awesome.

13
00:00:31,323 --> 00:00:32,741
Do you like it that much?

14
00:00:32,783 --> 00:00:33,825
What do you like so much?

15
00:00:33,909 --> 00:00:35,994
He just suddenly...

16
00:00:38,455 --> 00:00:39,957
(Jae Ha Yoo)

17
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:43,836
How did you know
about my hideout?

18
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:45,587
Your hideout?

19
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:47,589
It just looked pretty.

20
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:49,925
I'm impressed you know that.

21
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:52,344
Others think it's scary.

22
00:00:52,803 --> 00:00:55,305
It looks beautiful
from the inside.

23
00:00:56,223 --> 00:00:57,349
Do you go there often?

24
00:00:57,599 --> 00:00:58,642
Yes.

25
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:00,435
This is a secret.

26
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:01,687
Only I know about that place.

27
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:03,814
What a pity.

28
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:05,357
Now, I know about that place.

29
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:09,111
I'll make an exception.

30
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:12,614
Since when...

31
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:14,867
were you named?

32
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:20,706
It was in middle school.

33
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:23,959
I was lying down
on the tennis court.

34
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,295
You remember in detail.

35
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:28,797
I do.

36
00:01:28,964 --> 00:01:31,175
It was an unforgettable moment.

37
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:32,759
Five years, was it?

38
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:35,554
You must've waited
for a long time.

39
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:37,806
You're wrong.

40
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:39,308
I'm still waiting.

41
00:01:39,683 --> 00:01:40,726
Still.

42
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:45,814
You don't know
how this feels, do you?

43
00:01:46,398 --> 00:01:48,942
What a pity.
It's a nice feeling.

44
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:53,947
By the way, why did you ask?

45
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:57,117
-Well...
-If it's because of me,

46
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:58,619
you don't need to worry.

47
00:01:59,161 --> 00:02:02,164
I guess
fate breaks down sometimes.

48
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:04,708
I'm hungry.

49
00:02:13,717 --> 00:02:14,801
Do you want to ride in the back

50
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:17,679
since you're hungry?

51
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:33,779
"Do you want to ride
in the back?"

52
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:36,532
Hey.

53
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,158
He grabbed your hand

54
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,368
and rode the bike?

55
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:40,911
Isn't it obvious, then?

56
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,249
But he didn't actually
grab my hand.

57
00:02:45,249 --> 00:02:46,708
He probably just wanted
to befriend me.

58
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,669
That's why he touched you?

59
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:51,380
Then he's definitely a playboy!

60
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:53,382
I mean... Place your hand here.

61
00:02:53,382 --> 00:02:54,591
He grabbed it and said,

62
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:55,801
"Do you want to ride
in the back?"

63
00:02:55,843 --> 00:02:57,636
He made my heart skip a beat.

64
00:02:58,804 --> 00:02:59,888
It's hot in here.

65
00:03:01,265 --> 00:03:02,641
Hey, the playboy is here.

66
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:06,270
What were you giggling about?

67
00:03:06,395 --> 00:03:08,397
It's none of your business.

68
00:03:08,397 --> 00:03:10,274
Gosh, at this rate,
you guys should just

69
00:03:10,274 --> 00:03:11,441
live together.

70
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:14,152
I should go home.

71
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,738
Hey, good luck.

72
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:19,116
Why did you buy so much?

73
00:03:19,116 --> 00:03:21,201
Sae Rom, you're having dinner
with us, right?

74
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:22,703
No, I need to go.

75
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:23,745
We're having stir-fried pork.

76
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:25,330
-Yes!
-Your stir-fried pork

77
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,249
is the best.

78
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:29,209
But I really can't.

79
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:30,919
-I'm meeting my ex.
-What?

80
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:33,005
Why?

81
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:35,632
What was that reaction?

82
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:38,010
Why would you meet your ex?

83
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:39,803
I don't think you know,
but there are steps

84
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:41,430
to breaking up.

85
00:03:41,597 --> 00:03:42,764
She's meeting her ex?

86
00:03:43,432 --> 00:03:44,850
How could she say that
in front of her boyfriend?

87
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:47,811
Fine, he's too handsome
to get over.

88
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:48,854
I'm leaving.

89
00:03:49,438 --> 00:03:51,148
Hey, Sae Rom!

90
00:03:52,608 --> 00:03:54,443
Are they not in a relationship?

91
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,656
Should we have pizza,
your favorite?

92
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:03,243
Yes, pizza!

93
00:04:06,455 --> 00:04:07,623
Do you like pizza?

94
00:04:08,874 --> 00:04:10,959
I didn't know that.

95
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:13,504
Why are you following me?

96
00:04:13,712 --> 00:04:15,297
Don't meet him.

97
00:04:15,297 --> 00:04:17,090
I get that you're worried,

98
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,634
but I'm meeting him for closure.

99
00:04:18,634 --> 00:04:19,843
What if you get hurt again?

100
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,762
How many times has it been?

101
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:24,765
By now, you should know
how to avoid them.

102
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:26,350
What you're doing
isn't being nonchalant.

103
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:27,976
It's really pathetic.

104
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:29,603
Then what do you want me to do?

105
00:04:29,645 --> 00:04:31,522
I want to meet my soulmate,
but he's nowhere to be found.

106
00:04:31,522 --> 00:04:32,856
I feel like the only way
to find him is

107
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:34,691
by pretending to be nonchalant
when I'm actually pathetic.

108
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:47,079
I wonder if I'd be going
through this had I been named.

109
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:53,502
What?

110
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:55,754
Do you think those who are named
have no worries?

111
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:58,090
There are countless options
in our lifetime.

112
00:04:59,174 --> 00:05:00,384
It'd be nice

113
00:05:00,843 --> 00:05:02,344
if at least
finding your soulmate was easy.

114
00:05:06,265 --> 00:05:07,474
What if it's easy

115
00:05:08,392 --> 00:05:09,977
but you just don't know it yet?

116
00:05:12,855 --> 00:05:13,939
What?

117
00:05:15,983 --> 00:05:18,861
That's your problem.

118
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:22,030
You try to find the answer
in all the wrong places.

119
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:24,199
You need to look around you.

120
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:29,246
What are you saying?

121
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:33,166
Never mind if you don't get it.

122
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:36,503
So what's the answer?

123
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,714
-I don't know. Don't follow me.
-Wait up!

124
00:05:38,714 --> 00:05:39,840
I want to be alone.

125
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,639
Goodness.

126
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:51,143
Wake me up in ten minutes.

127
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:54,271
You can sleep for 15 minutes.

128
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:56,648
All right. 20, it is.

129
00:06:32,017 --> 00:06:33,477
You're wrong.

130
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:35,729
I'm still waiting.

131
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:37,147
Still.

132
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:40,692
If it's because of me,
you don't need to worry.

133
00:06:41,235 --> 00:06:44,279
I guess
fate breaks down sometimes.

134
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:55,791
I'm sorry.

135
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:57,960
I thought you were sleeping.

136
00:07:01,046 --> 00:07:02,172
I like this song.

137
00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:28,198
Hey.

138
00:07:28,532 --> 00:07:29,867
Why are you drinking alone?

139
00:07:33,579 --> 00:07:34,997
I guess I'll have one can less.

140
00:07:35,122 --> 00:07:36,248
Thanks.

141
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:48,844
I'm going to confess
to the girl I like.

142
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:51,263
Who is she?

143
00:07:55,893 --> 00:07:56,894
It's a secret.

144
00:07:57,144 --> 00:07:58,270
Come on.

145
00:08:01,857 --> 00:08:02,900
Me too.

146
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:06,945
I'm going to confess
to someone I like.

147
00:08:09,573 --> 00:08:10,741
Who is it?

148
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:15,454
Well...

149
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,957
Remember what we talked
about last time?

150
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:22,377
Right, we talked
about men liking men.

151
00:08:22,586 --> 00:08:23,670
Actually...

152
00:08:25,881 --> 00:08:27,174
That's about me.

153
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:29,134
What?

154
00:08:29,301 --> 00:08:31,261
I've never thought of it.

155
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:35,140
But I realized
the important thing is

156
00:08:35,891 --> 00:08:38,810
about liking that person,
whether it's a guy or a girl.

157
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:42,022
I found myself liking him.

158
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:46,985
Thanks for this.

159
00:08:53,617 --> 00:08:54,701
What?

160
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:57,162
Does he think Ji Woo is a guy?

161
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:02,376
Let me help.

162
00:09:02,501 --> 00:09:04,378
It's okay. I can manage.

163
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:08,090
You might trip.

164
00:09:13,971 --> 00:09:15,722
Are you this kind to everyone?

165
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:18,684
No, I'm not good at being kind.

166
00:09:19,685 --> 00:09:22,020
Being kind isn't a game.
It's not about being good at it.

167
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:23,313
I'm good at playing games.

168
00:09:24,106 --> 00:09:25,357
Was that a joke?

169
00:09:37,953 --> 00:09:39,746
It truly felt strange.

170
00:09:40,664 --> 00:09:42,416
My heart fluttered

171
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:44,042
for someone else

172
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:47,462
other than my dream soulmate.

173
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:50,465
You are kind.

174
00:09:56,555 --> 00:09:57,556
By the way,

175
00:09:59,433 --> 00:10:00,559
I have a question.

176
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:03,020
Dear my name

177
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:04,730
whom I've been waiting for

178
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:06,607
without realizing it...

179
00:10:07,316 --> 00:10:08,317
Just like the name
engraved on my arm,

180
00:10:09,568 --> 00:10:11,820
I think I'm broken as well.

181
00:10:17,034 --> 00:10:19,161
What do you think
about a guy liking another guy?

182
00:10:20,746 --> 00:10:21,780
What?

183
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:24,200
Can't believe it!
We were so carefree when we were alone.

184
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,800
Shall I ask Jae Ha to move out?

185
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:29,170
Feels like having a one-sided love for a long time.

186
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:31,640
Were you telling me you love me last time？

187
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:47,160
I'll call you when I find it.

188
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,400
There's only one thing that I don't know.

189
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:58,400
No, two.

190
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:00,770
It's already too late

191
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:02,270
when I know it.

192
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,010
I'm going to confess to the girl I like.

193
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:05,210
Who?

194
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,380
It's a secret.

195
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:08,650
My name.
