1
00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:02,780
The name on my disappeared.

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,220
Do you still like me

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:08,020
even so?

4
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:12,090
(Dear My Name)

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,530
I like you.

6
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,510
I missed my timing.

7
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,880
Is it truly over?

8
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,410
Look at how startled you are.
Your eyes might pop out.

9
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:43,290
Don't play jokes with me.

10
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:44,500
I'm serious.

11
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:51,220
Han Gyeol, I'm named.

12
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,050
I know.

13
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:56,800
So what?

14
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,640
What do you mean? I'm named.

15
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:06,020
And there's someone I like.

16
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:08,480
And is he your soulmate?

17
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:15,030
No.

18
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:18,870
I thought he was,

19
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:21,080
but I was wrong.

20
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:24,960
Nevertheless, I still like him.

21
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:30,840
So, you started to like him
because you thought

22
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,420
he was your soulmate.

23
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:37,300
If that's the case...

24
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:46,230
(Ji Woo Jeong)

25
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:48,110
If I do this,
will you like me too?

26
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:52,320
Did I like you
because of your name?

27
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,240
Or did I like you
because it was you?

28
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:56,700
Since when...

29
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:58,870
were you named?

30
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,790
It became clear.

31
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,040
I like you,

32
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:10,960
Jae Ha Yoo,

33
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:13,800
because it's you.

34
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,600
It doesn't matter

35
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:28,060
if my name is engraved
on you or not.

36
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,730
I like you

37
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:33,320
as a senior and a friend
whom I'm close to.

38
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,900
The same goes for him.

39
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:39,410
I didn't like him
because of his name.

40
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:43,990
Because even when I thought
he wasn't my soulmate,

41
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:46,620
I still liked him.

42
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:51,590
Are you named?

43
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,630
You're not? What do you mean?

44
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:54,760
Well...

45
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:57,170
I'm unnamed.

46
00:02:58,010 --> 00:02:59,090
Once.

47
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:02,100
You were going to confess
to someone you like.

48
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:05,020
I should do it before you do.

49
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:06,390
Twice.

50
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:07,640
Were you ever like me?

51
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:09,730
Just like forgetting

52
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:12,020
to bring your umbrella
on a rainy day,

53
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,650
have you ever missed your timing

54
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:17,280
because you were acting
like a fool?

55
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,160
I've missed my timing twice.

56
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,580
Is it truly over?

57
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:31,460
Not yet.

58
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,590
I still have a chance

59
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:35,250
before

60
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:36,880
it rains.

61
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,680
Do you hate me
for refusing so firmly?

62
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,220
I can't help it.

63
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:48,140
I want our friendship to last.

64
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:50,730
That's why you're hurting me?

65
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,020
Are you a pervert?

66
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,440
Jae Ha doesn't like me.

67
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:01,200
It's not me.

68
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:04,120
It's you.

69
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,080
The name engraved on my arm...

70
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:15,840
(Jae Ha Yoo)

71
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,960
My soulmate.

72
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,970
I've been looking everywhere

73
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:23,430
for this guy
who's before my eyes.

74
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:24,970
Jae Ha Yoo.

75
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,680
I never thought I'd find

76
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,640
my soulmate.

77
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,690
I'm glad

78
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:35,190
I'm not late.

79
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:36,190
She's my destiny.

80
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,440
What?

81
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,280
I like you.

82
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:42,780
I really do.

83
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:45,700
And

84
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,040
your name is engraved on me.

85
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,910
You have my name?

86
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,380
I'm sorry
I didn't tell you sooner.

87
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:58,090
But it felt like
it was now or never.

88
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,130
This was something
I had asked myself as well.

89
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:04,550
(Jae Ha Yoo)

90
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,140
My name disappeared.

91
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,310
Would you still

92
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,150
like me?

93
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:18,400
Yes.

94
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:20,610
That's not why I started
to like you.

95
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,150
And

96
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:25,410
this was my answer as well.

97
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:27,450
At 21,

98
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:30,120
I finally met him.

99
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,630
I found

100
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:39,250
my dream soulmate.

101
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:55,770
There were several times

102
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,810
when we had met before.

103
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:06,570
Who is he?

104
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:08,530
It's a stranger.

105
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,830
Why are you blushing?

106
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,040
I don't know.

107
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,750
Come on. Tell me!

108
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Who is this?

109
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:17,920
It's a stranger.

110
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:19,630
She just got in the frame.

111
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,590
Had we not met each other...

112
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:22,510
How did she get in here?

113
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:23,880
We'd have never known.

114
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,430
It was a pure coincidence.

115
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,010
Dear my name.

116
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,930
Where have you been

117
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:31,720
all this time?

118
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:42,820
Why are you here?

119
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:47,820
I have something to say.

120
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,030
What is it?

121
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:54,750
So...

122
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:56,580
You have five minutes.
I have somewhere to be.

123
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,080
There you go again.

124
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:01,040
How am I supposed to say this

125
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:03,340
if you rush me?

126
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:04,960
So...

127
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,380
Be patient with me.

128
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:09,800
What's the point
in helping him talk

129
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,680
when he's a fool, to begin with?

130
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:15,470
Sae Rom.

131
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:17,230
So...

132
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:19,400
Do you want...

133
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,650
Let's go out.

134
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:25,150
What?

135
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:27,110
I was going to let you say it,

136
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:29,280
but you're being such an idiot,
and it's frustrating me.

137
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,950
I'm not the patient type either.

138
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,530
Really? Are you serious?

139
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:37,370
Are you serious?
Are we going out?

140
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:39,500
Who knows?

141
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:40,830
What do you mean?

142
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,460
You didn't give me an answer.

143
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:43,670
I asked you out.

144
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:45,670
Are you stupid?

145
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:49,720
It's obviously

146
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:53,010
a yes.

147
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,180
Whatever.

148
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,330
Hey, do it again.

149
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:16,910
(Three months later)

150
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:19,460
Only I should be the one
who sees it. Kiss me.

151
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:21,290
All those years,

152
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:22,830
looking for a soulmate,
have passed.

153
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,380
And now, it's winter again.

154
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:26,420
And by my side,

155
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,220
there is Jae Ha, my soulmate.

156
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,050
Don't hurt him!

157
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:33,800
In this world where
your soulmates are chosen,

158
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:37,060
someone has said that
your decisions don't matter.

159
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:42,190
However, I don't believe that
fate exists

160
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,730
without making any decisions.

161
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,570
Just like those who love
without knowing their fate...

162
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:48,900
Just like how
we loved each other

163
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:50,530
when we knew we weren't
each other's soulmates,

164
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:54,780
we will continue
to make decisions

165
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:58,290
in this world.

166
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:06,250
We were destined.

167
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,550
And we will continue to be so.

168
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:12,590
Dear my name.

169
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:17,900
(Dear My Name)

170
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:32,380
(Jae Ha Yoo)

171
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,350
(Jae Ha Yoo)

172
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,150
Are you

173
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:53,150
named?

174
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,400
No.

175
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:56,950
My soulmate

176
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:58,660
is a guy.

177
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:00,070
So the new tenant is...

178
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:05,410
They can't live
without each other.

179
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:07,620
They're having a blast in there,
screaming like this.

180
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:09,420
Wait here.

181
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:16,470
Everything happens...

182
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:20,800
Just find a guy who likes you.

183
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:22,100
Wake up, Jae Ha.

184
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:25,600
Yes, pizza!

185
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:27,560
Are you sure

186
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,100
you're not just unaware of it?

187
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:34,440
I'm going to confess
to the girl I like.

188
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:37,200
I wanted to see something.

189
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:45,040
I like you.
