1
00:00:00,584 --> 00:00:01,668
Are you

2
00:00:02,085 --> 00:00:04,004
Jae Ha Yoo?

3
00:00:04,379 --> 00:00:05,589
I finally met

4
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:09,420
my soulmate whom I've been
dreaming to meet.

5
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,090
Dear my name.

6
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:13,700
Where have you been
all this time?

7
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:18,090
(Dear My Name)

8
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:18,970
(One day, 2013)

9
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:22,980
I was named at the age of 16.

10
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:26,700
(Yoo Jae Ha)

11
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:28,990
It appeared.

12
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:31,080
I made a promise that day.

13
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:34,040
"Jae Ha Yoo."

14
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:35,920
That when I get to meet you,

15
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:38,960
I'd love you with all my heart.

16
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,000
(Ji Woo Jeong's name,
Jae Ha Yoo)

17
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:53,210
I had previously thought
that it'd be easy

18
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:54,630
to meet my soulmate.

19
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:56,460
However, I had to look for him

20
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,130
for a very long time.

21
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:01,540
What?

22
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:05,010
(Ji Woo Jeong, Name: Jae Ha Yoo
Jae Ha Yoo, Name: Soo Jeong Kim)

23
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:10,460
Jae Ha Yoo.

24
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:11,500
(Soo Jeong Kim, Jae Ha Yoo)

25
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,400
None of them

26
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,360
were my soulmate.

27
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,020
I think it's because
I didn't have breakfast.

28
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:24,320
-Stop it.
-No.

29
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,190
-I'm on an empty stomach.
-Hurry up!

30
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:29,320
Jae Ha Yoo, where are you?

31
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,950
Jae Ha Yoo, where are you?

32
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:38,020
After five years,
I finally realized

33
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:41,150
that everyone but me
found their soulmates.

34
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:44,690
In this world, there are those
who are named and unnamed.

35
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:46,400
The former has
their soulmates' names

36
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,820
engraved on their bodies.

37
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:49,410
The latter doesn't.

38
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:53,860
When you meet your soulmate,

39
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,270
the name twinkles.

40
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:00,700
But then again,
it has nothing to do with me.

41
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:05,350
Hey, Sae Rom.
Why aren't you here?

42
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:10,190
(Wash your hair,
No PDA in this room)

43
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:20,950
I did it.

44
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,330
No wonder
you're the top student.

45
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:28,000
It looks like you.

46
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:31,250
It's a compliment.

47
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:33,000
What is it? Are you jealous?

48
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:36,840
Rather than working like a dog

49
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,720
and living a miserable life,

50
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,300
I'd be a brat.

51
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:41,390
Was that a compliment?

52
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:42,430
What do you think?

53
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,480
Look at yourself.

54
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:48,980
How many all-nighters
have you pulled so far?

55
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:51,730
-Three?
-What?

56
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:52,820
Three days.

57
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,320
Let me guess. Kimchi stew?

58
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:00,070
Yes.

59
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,030
I'm living like this

60
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,870
thanks to Jae Ha.

61
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,250
Darn it.

62
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:23,080
Hey!

63
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,580
How dare you
not receive my calls or texts

64
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:25,950
on your first day
back at school?

65
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:27,080
I tap out!

66
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:28,620
It's been a long time,
Han Gyeol.

67
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:29,710
What were you up to?

68
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:30,920
Just this and that.

69
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:35,590
You haven't changed a bit.

70
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:40,340
The same goes for you.

71
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,050
That doesn't sound too nice.
It really doesn't.

72
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,470
Fine, I'm sorry.

73
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,470
What have you been doing?

74
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:50,730
(Sae Rom: Where are you?)

75
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:51,810
(I'm in the toilet
in front of the drawing room.)

76
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:55,360
(Sae Rom: Okay, honey.
I'm almost there.)

77
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,110
I promise you. It's really easy.

78
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:01,200
Just think of it as taking
a few photos for the graduation.

79
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:03,280
Why aren't you mentioning
that it's free?

80
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:07,080
Come on. Seriously.

81
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,790
Seriously. Please?

82
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,410
Honey.

83
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,290
You look so cute.

84
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:15,750
You look so exhausted.

85
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,300
I think I might die.

86
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,920
There they go again.

87
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,470
Who is that?

88
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:21,800
A junior from my major.

89
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:23,470
Handsome, right?

90
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,470
After every class,

91
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:27,260
all the girls ask
for that kid's number.

92
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:28,470
(Men)

93
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:29,850
Don't you need to
get some sleep?

94
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:31,190
Let's go after class.

95
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:32,230
Really?

96
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:33,310
So...

97
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:34,940
Are you really not going
to help me?

98
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:36,110
I'm not sure.

99
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:38,980
Why not? Jae Ha, Jae Ha, Jae Ha!
Aren't you looking for a house?

100
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,570
I have a free room.

101
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,860
(Introduction to Names)

102
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:54,670
What? Are you guys sleeping
with your eyes open?

103
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:56,170
Wake up. Class is over.

104
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,130
Sae Rom just broke up
with a guy she's been dating

105
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:00,880
for the past week.

106
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,970
"Just now"?

107
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,970
I truly thought
he was my soulmate.

108
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:06,970
How could she think like that
when she's unnamed?

109
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:09,560
Hey, the unnamed could also
have soulmates, you know?

110
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,180
Sure. That's why you should
look for your soulmate.

111
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:14,730
Unnamed have their own way
of loving each other.

112
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,360
They search for their soulmates
and pursue their happiness.

113
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,650
No.

114
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:21,440
This was something
I've been thinking about.

115
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,320
Then I don't think
you should tell us about it.

116
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,530
You two look great together.
Why don't you go out?

117
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:27,570
Ji Woo! Are you insane?

118
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,580
Jiwoo! Are you insane?

119
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:31,750
Why are you getting angry?

120
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:34,460
I should be the one
who's more upset.

121
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:36,460
-What? I'm upset too.
-Hey.

122
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:37,710
(Where are you?)

123
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:39,550
I'm about to head
to our hideout.

124
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:40,960
(No, come to the drawing room.)

125
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,840
I left that place
just two hours ago.

126
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,800
(Come on. I'll buy you
strawberry milk if you come.)

127
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,640
Hey,
do you think I'll fall for that?

128
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,850
-Han Gyeol, did you know?
-What?

129
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,440
Among those
in their fifth year of college,

130
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,400
you're the most artistic one.

131
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,280
Did you just look down on me?

132
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:04,740
No.

133
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:06,860
I reduce your monthly rent
by 50 percent

134
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:08,450
every time you help me out.

135
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:09,990
Are you still not happy?

136
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,490
Can't you see I'm exhilarated?

137
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:16,580
Let me repeat myself.

138
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:19,000
What happens
if an assistant bleeds?

139
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:21,460
Wouldn't they die?

140
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:23,880
That's right.
That's how they die.

141
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:26,470
It'll be
a quiet and lonely death.

142
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,840
I'll buy us beer.

143
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:31,180
Maybe next time.
I'm on food duty today.

144
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,560
We don't have such a thing.

145
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,890
I need to feed Sam Sik.

146
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:37,140
Right, we need to feed our cat.

147
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,020
Okay, you can go now.

148
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:40,480
-Can I leave right now?
-Yes.

149
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:42,070
Oh, yes!

150
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:46,780
Bye.

151
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:55,040
Bye.

152
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,880
My soulmate appeared

153
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,300
before my eyes
on an ordinary day.

154
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:10,680
And from that day on,

155
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,470
my days became very special.

156
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:18,110
My name

157
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,280
sparkled so brightly

158
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:22,530
just like

159
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:25,240
the fickle finger of fate.

160
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,320
Excuse me.

161
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:06,020
(Finally get to meet you at the age of 21.)

162
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,120
Are you

163
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:11,630
Jae Ha Yoo?

164
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,960
Yes, I am.

165
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,880
Then

166
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:20,970
are you named?

167
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:27,700
(The destined one I've been dreaming of.)

168
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:32,220
No.

169
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,900
(Something unexpected happened.)

170
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,410
A junior from my major.

171
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:57,080
Handsome, right?

172
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,410
After every class,

173
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:01,080
all the girls ask
for that kid's number.

174
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,310
My soulmate is...

175
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:06,420
A guy.
