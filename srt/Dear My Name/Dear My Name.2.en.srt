1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:03,200
Something unexpected happened.

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:07,010
My soulmate is...

3
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:10,690
A guy.

4
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:16,630
(Dear My Name)

5
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:27,640
Jae Ha.

6
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:30,190
-What are you doing?
-What? I'm sorry.

7
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:31,310
I'll do it again.

8
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:35,230
What is it?
Is something going on?

9
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,980
Are you named?

10
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,450
Hey.

11
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:44,530
-I have a question.
-Shoot.

12
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:47,700
Let's say that you're named.

13
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:49,040
How would you feel

14
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:53,630
if your soulmate was a guy?

15
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:57,250
Since it's already been decided,
shouldn't you try to get along?

16
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,050
There are many people like that.

17
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:00,630
What do you think?

18
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,590
What? Me?

19
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:04,390
I'm...

20
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,600
I'm not ready to accept that.

21
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:09,100
Why do you ask?

22
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,890
Do you have my name?

23
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,810
Come on, don't be ridiculous.

24
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:17,820
If that's the case,
let me know beforehand

25
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:18,980
so that I can prepare myself.

26
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:20,280
What nonsense is that?

27
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:21,900
He's really not your soulmate?

28
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:25,600
No.

29
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:29,130
You're not? What do you mean?

30
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:30,940
Well...

31
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,570
-I'm unnamed.
-Wait.

32
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,530
He's unnamed?

33
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:42,410
But yours sparkled?

34
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:43,790
Yes.

35
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:45,750
And

36
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:47,160
something felt different.

37
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:48,410
What do you mean?

38
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,670
It felt as if I just stopped
after running.

39
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:52,880
I could feel my heartbeat
on my face.

40
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,840
That's how I felt
when I was named.

41
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,050
You're moving in today, right?

42
00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:59,340
I'll leave the room vacant.

43
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:03,180
Anyway, it was so strange.

44
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,560
It really is.

45
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:06,810
Right? It's strange, right?

46
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:07,980
Yes, it is.

47
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,900
Was he really that handsome?

48
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:14,570
Then there's no way
I wouldn't know him.

49
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:15,900
My gosh.

50
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:18,320
That's not what's important
right now.

51
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,450
If only one side is named,
is that person doomed

52
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:25,450
to have an innate crush?

53
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:26,660
-Hey.
-What?

54
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,910
Let's strip him.

55
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,870
Hey, are you crazy?

56
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,130
What do you mean?

57
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:36,250
It's ridiculous that
he's unnamed.

58
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:38,840
You should check for yourself
whether he's named or not.

59
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,510
But still...

60
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:42,930
Is there a way?

61
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:45,640
-We can always find a way.
-Come on.

62
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,850
How could I do that?

63
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,600
What is it? Can you not do it?

64
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:50,770
Then should I?

65
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:52,020
Didn't you say he was handsome?

66
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:56,360
The house used to be
my workplace.

67
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:59,240
Now, I've rented it out
to my close juniors.

68
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,900
Think of it as a share house.

69
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,490
Hey, what were you imagining?

70
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:04,740
-Hey!
-What is it?

71
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:07,660
Anyway, I'm fine whenever,

72
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:09,290
so call me
when you want to do it, honey.

73
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:12,250
-Bye.
-Bye.

74
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,930
Jae Ha Yoo?

75
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:35,560
Gosh, it's getting late.

76
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:46,120
You're here early.

77
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,200
What?

78
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:50,950
Why did you say that? Why?

79
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:54,870
Let me give you a tour.

80
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:58,090
This is the kitchen.
Isn't it neat and pretty?

81
00:03:58,090 --> 00:03:59,460
I designed the interior.

82
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:00,800
This is the living room.

83
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:03,170
Isn't it pretty and neat?
I designed this as well.

84
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:04,300
So the new tenant is...

85
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:11,470
How fascinating.

86
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:13,270
-It's quite fascinating.
-You can attach your name

87
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:16,020
on the side dishes,
but we usually share them.

88
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:19,020
And if the toilet gets clogged,
do tell me.

89
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:20,820
I'm sorry.

90
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:22,860
Are you feeling ill?

91
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:24,900
No.

92
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,280
Han Gyeol.

93
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:28,910
What?

94
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,280
Can I get a refund on the rent?

95
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:33,250
No.

96
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,830
Guys, we're having
a beer party tonight.

97
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,590
Ta-da. Isn't he handsome?

98
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,170
This is Jae Ha Yoo
from photography, class of 2017.

99
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:47,640
This is architecture major,
class of 2019, Ji Woo Jeong.

100
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:48,850
-And this is...
-I am

101
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:50,350
Seong Min from architecture,
class of 2019.

102
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,350
-Hello.
-Hello.

103
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:54,480
-Anyway, Ji Woo.
-Yes?

104
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,230
What are you doing? Say hi.

105
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:57,440
Are you being mean
to our newbie?

106
00:04:57,650 --> 00:04:59,360
What? I'm not.

107
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,690
Hello.

108
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,020
Hello.

109
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,650
What's this vibe?
It's very weird.

110
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:09,280
It feels like
when I met my ex-girlfriend.

111
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:12,080
Shut it.

112
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,240
What?

113
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:15,580
Is it just me?
Isn't Ji Woo strange?

114
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:16,830
You're right.

115
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,880
Are you feeling sick?

116
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:22,340
I'm fine.

117
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:24,380
I'm just shy around strangers.

118
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:30,260
Don't be ridiculous.

119
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:32,430
Whenever the delivery man comes,
you guys become

120
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:33,930
best friends.

121
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,270
Shut it
if you don't want to die.

122
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:41,730
There's chicken in the fridge.

123
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:42,980
Let me get that.

124
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:46,690
I'll come with you. You might
feel shy in front of it.

125
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,570
You'll get used to this.

126
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:59,250
I heard you're Han Gyeol's junior
from high school.

127
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:00,330
Yes, that's right.

128
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:02,540
You should talk more comfortably
to me.

129
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:06,760
Is it only you four
who's living here?

130
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:09,550
Yes. It's just us.

131
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:13,510
I think I saw

132
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:15,520
a long-haired girl
this afternoon.

133
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,480
Oh, Sae Rom Yang?

134
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:19,600
She doesn't live here.

135
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,150
But I guess she kind of does.

136
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:22,150
She visits often.

137
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:23,980
They can't live
without each other.

138
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:26,650
Once they go into the room,
they never come out.

139
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:28,110
Thinking about it
makes me irritated again.

140
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:30,530
I have no idea what they do
every night.

141
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:31,780
They're so noisy.

142
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:35,280
They're having a blast in there,
screaming like this.

143
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:36,910
They're really loud.

144
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,160
It's going to be worse for you
since you live next-door.

145
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,210
Good luck.

146
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:41,460
Anyway, I'm fine whenever,

147
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:42,960
so call me
when you want to do it, honey.

148
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,710
I'm fine even if there are
many people. Okay?

149
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:46,960
Are you cold?

150
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,970
I'm fine.

151
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:50,010
Do you like to drink?

152
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,350
You should check for yourself
whether he's named or not.

153
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:57,560
You just need to check his arm.

154
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,890
I heard soulmates' names
are engraved on the same spot.

155
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:01,100
I wanted to tell you this
from a while ago,

156
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:03,100
-but you're so handsome.
-My gosh.

157
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:06,190
I'm loving this vibe.

158
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,860
You're doing well.

159
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,610
Be nice to him.

160
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:12,280
He's a returning student,
so he doesn't have any friends.

161
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,160
These are aori apples.
I've never seen them before.

162
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,700
-Who wants one?
-I do.

163
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:18,830
-Here.
-Cut it for me.

164
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:20,960
Should I just strip him?

165
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:42,310
-That's not how you chew it.
-What?

166
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:44,770
Goodness.

167
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:46,110
-Are you okay?
-I'm sorry.

168
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:47,940
-I'm fine.
-Hey.

169
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:50,440
-I'm sorry.
-You should be more careful.

170
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:51,940
Are you all right?

171
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,490
Oh, no.

172
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:56,450
Let me go change.

173
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:58,410
-Okay.
-All right.

174
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:00,950
What? Is he really unnamed?

175
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,750
Seriously?

176
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:12,800
I did that? Do you know
what you did?

177
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,340
You were doing this.

178
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,020
They can't live
without each other.

179
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:28,560
Once they go into the room,
they never come out.

180
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,860
They're having a blast in there,
screaming like this.

181
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,120
It's not there.

182
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:47,580
Why isn't it?

183
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:50,590
It's really not there?

184
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:52,800
Here it is. Here's your beer.

185
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:54,970
Not this.

186
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:57,590
It's a lie.

187
00:08:57,890 --> 00:08:59,050
Mine...

188
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:00,510
Mine...

189
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:02,810
Mine is right here.

190
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,690
Forget it.

191
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:08,600
Living as an unnamed
is much better.

192
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:16,650
She's drunk.

193
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:20,320
Ji Woo, go inside and sleep.

194
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,620
Give me one more.

195
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,580
No, go inside.

196
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:27,710
-Come on, just one more.
-She's too drunk.

197
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:32,380
Wait here.

198
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:34,300
I need to go to the bathroom.

199
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,890
Why did she tell us that
she's going to the bathroom?

200
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:13,960
A name has been engraved

201
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:17,470
near my heart
for a very long time.

202
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,970
And that person

203
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:20,680
is

204
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,640
before my eyes.

205
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,080
I'd like to apologize to you too.

206
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:36,310
What did you do to me yesterday?

207
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:39,680
Did you try it with anyone else?

208
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:40,890
Does it have anything to do with you?

209
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:42,750
I thought you and him were over.

210
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:56,080
Jae Ha.

211
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:02,290
What did you shoot this time?

212
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:04,000
Just photos.

213
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:06,090
That's a name.

214
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:09,840
How jealous. You don't have
a name yet, do you?

215
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:11,340
-No.
-Me neither.

216
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,850
I wonder how it feels
to meet your soulmate.

217
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:17,970
I'm not sure.

218
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:20,390
I'll let you know
if I meet mine first.

219
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:23,360
I feel like I'll meet mine

220
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,810
before you do.

221
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:29,070
For you to meet yours,
it'll be a bit...

222
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:33,070
"A bit"? "A bit" what?

223
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,490
-Continue.
-Han Gyeol.

224
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:35,620
What?

225
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:36,830
No way.

226
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:39,410
-You're unnamed.
-You startled me.

227
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:40,790
Dear my name.

228
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:45,750
You were always
in my imagination.
