1
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:46,310
Brother

2
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:47,350
Profiteering during national crisis

3
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,280
War profiteering

4
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:50,000
No one gets rich without taking risks

5
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:52,430
What's the point of telling me all this?

6
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:54,000
Mizuno Shingen

7
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,950
Sent Hirata Kiko to headquarters

8
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,640
For what purpose?

9
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,640
To put it nicely

10
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,230
It's to assist headquarters

11
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:02,790
To put it bluntly

12
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,640
This is power infiltration

13
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,480
Director Li's administration is solid as iron

14
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,870
They've sidelined Hirata Kiko

15
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:11,360
Would the Japanese accept that?

16
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,190
What they're after

17
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:15,280
is Director Li's piece of the pie

18
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,150
If you go after the director's share

19
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:18,360
Go talk to the director

20
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,840
I'm just a minor player

21
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,190
If you go to the director

22
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:23,280
Aren't you just making yourself the scapegoat?

23
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,750
You're the one handling it

24
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:27,630
When the gods fight

25
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:28,910
It's the mortals who suffer

26
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:30,870
If you don't find a way to save yourself now

27
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:32,590
When the time comes

28
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:34,520
and the Japanese come knocking

29
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:35,840
Just watch Director Li

30
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,190
See who he'll sell out first

31
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:02,470
At this moment

32
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:03,630
Back in the light

33
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:04,800
From prisoner

34
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,280
to honored guest

35
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,430
Mr. Lu's current state of mind

36
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:10,000
must be very different now

37
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,520
I do have a suggestion

38
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:17,630
Say it.

39
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:18,560
I'm so anxious right now.

40
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,030
Why are you keeping me in suspense?

41
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,870
Given the current situation,

42
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:24,520
sacrificing the pawn to save the king

43
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,240
is the wise move.

44
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,190
What do you mean?

45
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:28,870
You have to

46
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:30,680
give up some of your profits

47
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,190
and hand over some of the goods

48
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:33,190
to the Japanese.

49
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,750
Let them get their hands on it.

50
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,400
Then they won't investigate further.

51
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:38,680
Besides, these goods

52
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,470
include a share for Director Li, right?

53
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:43,280
So he'll definitely find a way

54
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,030
to help you cover it up.

55
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,400
In the end, they'll just turn a blind eye.

56
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:48,190
At worst,

57
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,430
you'll just have to write a self-criticism.

58
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:50,750
And that'll be the end of it.

59
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,190
How am I supposed to give up profits to the Japanese?

60
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:57,240
Just say it was someone else.

61
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:58,750
Blame it on your subordinates.

62
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,280
They broke the rules.

63
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:02,870
And voluntarily told Hirata Xizi.

64
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:03,840
When the time comes,

65
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:05,680
I'll put in a good word for you.

66
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,360
This matter

67
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:08,080
will be downplayed.

68
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:11,430
Brother,

69
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:13,000
what else can I say?

70
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:14,080
At critical moments,

71
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,520
you can only rely on your own people.

72
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,750
Empty words of thanks like this

73
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:20,160
are enough.

74
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,680
Just stop setting me up in the future.

75
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:24,240
I'd be grateful for that.

76
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,310
You should understand me too.

77
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:28,800
I'm just following the director's orders.

78
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:30,120
But honestly,

79
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:31,120
in front of him,

80
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,800
I've said a lot of good things about you.

81
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,720
I know.

82
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:34,920
This is the director's idea.

83
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,750
You're in a tough spot too.

84
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:39,920
Brother,

85
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,600
before,

86
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,630
you got entangled with those two girls.

87
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:46,190
The director has always suspected you.

88
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:48,360
He told me to keep a close eye on you.

89
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,950
He's so suspicious.

90
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,950
I think you should find a chance

91
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:54,630
to explain things clearly to him.

92
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:58,830
Thank you.

93
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:19,600
What a rare guest we have.

94
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,270
Mr. Mizuno here

95
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:23,680
has personally visited our Special Operations Headquarters.

96
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:25,800
It is truly an honor.

97
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,920
I hope my visit isn't too abrupt.

98
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,360
Please don't take offense.

99
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,750
Not at all.

100
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:32,750
Mr. Mizuno is Chairman Wang's military advisor

101
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,480
and also the spiritual mentor of our headquarters.

102
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,310
Coming here is like coming home.

103
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:38,480
There's nothing abrupt about it.

104
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:39,510
Director Li,

105
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:40,680
I'm glad you don't treat me as an outsider.

106
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,240
This time, I've come

107
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,360
to announce a decision.

108
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,480
The Special Operations Committee has already approved it.

109
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,630
A Supervisory Office will be established within the headquarters.

110
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,800
A new director will be appointed.

111
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:53,390
This Supervisory Office

112
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,000
will be independent from the headquarters.

113
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:58,000
Relevant operations can report directly to Meihua Hall.

114
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:04,510
Mr. Mizuno

115
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,510
The appointment you mentioned

116
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,870
I don't think I've received any notification about it yet.

117
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:10,800
Well then,

118
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,510
now you know.

119
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,920
Mr. Mizuno

120
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,560
Our No. 76 organization

121
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,600
serves Chairman Wang.

122
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:19,240
In terms of internal affairs,

123
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,870
we have autonomy.

124
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:21,920
Besides,

125
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,390
for such a long time,

126
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:25,390
there has never been

127
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:27,120
in departmental appointments

128
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:29,950
a precedent for hiring foreigners.

129
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:30,950
Director Li

130
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:33,270
rest assured,

131
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:36,160
the person I recommended is also Chinese.

132
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,510
Lu Xijian

133
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:40,360
Director Lu

134
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,310
Mr. Lu

135
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,600
It's our first meeting.

136
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:23,310
A pleasure to meet you.

137
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,160
Director Liang

138
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,630
It's been a while. I hope you've been well.

139
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:47,630
Why does Mr. Lu know Director Liang

140
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,560
but Director Liang doesn't know Mr. Lu?

141
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,000
Director Liang and I

142
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,310
only met once by chance.

143
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,000
It's normal that he didn't notice me.

144
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:14,480
Half a year ago,

145
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,120
we were still on opposing sides.

146
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,070
At that time, Director Liang

147
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,870
led a team to the Grand World to arrest an informant.

148
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,040
I happened to be there.

149
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:27,390
And it almost cost me my life.

150
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:33,080
Is that so?

151
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:35,600
I can't quite remember.

152
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,150
However,

153
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,840
there's one thing

154
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:41,080
I truly admire about you, Mr. Lu.

155
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:42,630
Admire what?

156
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,270
I admire you, Mr. Lu,

157
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,480
for your luck in surviving.

158
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,910
In your China

159
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:52,150
there's a saying

160
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:53,510
that goes, "No fight, no acquaintance."

161
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,320
It seems the two of you

162
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,960
are truly destined to meet.

163
00:08:58,670 --> 00:08:59,720
Mr. Lu

164
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:00,870
Congratulations

165
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:04,630
Thank you

166
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:08,360
Director Lu

167
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:09,360
Congratulations

168
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:11,320
I'm the Director of the Intelligence Department

169
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:12,120
Cui Mo

170
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:13,870
Nice to meet you

171
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,080
Everyone, congratulate Director Lu

172
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:18,080
Congratulations, Director Lu! Congratulations, Director Lu!

173
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:18,910
Nice to meet you all

174
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:20,480
Nice to meet you, nice to meet you

175
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,200
Thank you

176
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:24,720
The Japanese really are brazen

177
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,960
They openly plant their people in headquarters

178
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,790
Isn't this a slap in the face to the Director?

179
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:31,200
And the Director still has to pretend to go along

180
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,360
Like a mute forced to swallow bitterness

181
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,480
Suffering in silence

182
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,630
Mizuno Shingen's cunning and tactics

183
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,200
Brother Cui, you've witnessed them too

184
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:41,630
As for the smuggling matter

185
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:42,870
it's best to be cautious

186
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:43,600
Don't worry

187
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,390
I'll be extra careful

188
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:45,440
Directors

189
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,510
You don't seem very enthusiastic

190
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,120
Speaking of which

191
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,870
Director Liang and Director Lu are old acquaintances too

192
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,960
Why not go say hello?

193
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:55,670
Brother Cui

194
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:56,960
I can't hold my liquor

195
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,600
so I'll excuse myself

196
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,150
Director Cui

197
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,750
Let's have a drink

198
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:07,750
Chief Chen

199
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:08,910
Suit yourself.

200
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:38,030
Sir, long time no see.

201
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,030
You are...

202
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:49,440
Sir, you really are forgetful.

203
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,870
We just met yesterday.

204
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,320
Scorpio asked me to give you a message.

205
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:58,840
Tomorrow night at eight.

206
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,200
Second floor of Jiangfeng Restaurant.

207
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,440
There’s an important matter to discuss.

208
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:10,000
You’ve got the wrong person.

209
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,910
Sir, you really are forgetful.

210
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:29,120
We just met yesterday.

211
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:33,600
Scorpio asked me to give you a message.

212
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:35,120
Tomorrow night at eight.

213
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,480
Second floor of Jiangfeng Restaurant.

214
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,720
There’s an important matter to discuss.

215
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,270
You’ve got the wrong person.

216
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,840
You’ve got the wrong person.

217
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,030
I really didn’t expect him to answer like that.

218
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,030
Does this count as exposing himself?

219
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:05,600
He didn’t take any action against you.

220
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:07,240
That means...

221
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:11,480
It means he can’t be separated from the Military Bureau.

222
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,440
Chief’s move seems simple.

223
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,870
But it’s actually psychological warfare.

224
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:19,080
No matter how he answers, he’ll leave a flaw.

225
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,750
As long as we have the recording,

226
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:23,750
it’s like planting a thorn in the director’s heart.

227
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:25,120
The bait is ready.

228
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:27,120
Now we just wait for the fish to bite.

229
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,390
With this recording,

230
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,120
as long as Liang Shuo goes to the restaurant,

231
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,870
his connection to the Military Bureau

232
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:35,600
will be confirmed.

233
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,960
What if he doesn’t go?

234
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:43,150
Then let's take this recording

235
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:44,630
and present it to the director.

236
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:46,790
At the very least, Liang Shuo

237
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:48,200
is guilty of sheltering enemy agents.

238
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,200
When the time comes,

239
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,870
let's see how he explains himself.

240
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:53,750
When the time comes,

241
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,630
make sure we have people stationed around the restaurant.

242
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:57,080
We'll expose his true colors.

243
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,510
Are you still worried, Team Leader,

244
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,480
that the rest of the plan won't work out?

245
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,360
Then

246
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,120
we'll know the outcome tomorrow night.

247
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,030
Yes.

248
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:07,510
This Lu Xijian,

249
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:10,150
though he appears obedient on the surface,

250
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:12,480
just as you predicted, Chief,

251
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,670
placing him in the Special Operations Headquarters

252
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:15,200
in such an important position,

253
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:17,670
is it really appropriate?

254
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:18,840
Hirata,

255
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:21,600
the matter of Lu Xijian being untrustworthy—

256
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,960
so that's what you think.

257
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,720
Great minds think alike.

258
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,000
Well then,

259
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:29,360
the Special Operations Headquarters already harbors resentment toward us.

260
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:31,840
If we let someone from the rebel Military Command

261
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:34,080
join them,

262
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,720
the situation will become even more interesting.

263
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:38,550
If Lu Xijian knows he is hard to trust,

264
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,270
he will surely try his best to protect himself.

265
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,360
This will make Lu Xijian

266
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,630
even more loyal to us.

267
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:47,150
So that's how it is.

268
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,390
It really takes someone like you, Chief,

269
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:51,320
to be so farsighted.

270
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,720
My thinking was still too shallow.

271
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:55,670
Acting first and reporting later,

272
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,670
placing Lu Xijian right in front of me,

273
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,080
a traitor from the Military Command,

274
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,200
how outrageous!

275
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:02,600
That Mizuno is truly going too far.

276
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:05,360
Director

277
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,270
Please calm down.

278
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:07,750
I've already asked.

279
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:09,840
Those old bastards from the Special Affairs Committee

280
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,440
all completely shirked responsibility.

281
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,120
Their attitude is already very clear.

282
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:14,550
Not only do they know about this,

283
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:16,510
they're also involved in it.

284
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,030
So,

285
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:20,270
should we send a report to Director Ding?

286
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:21,720
Let him handle it.

287
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:24,910
These are troubled times.

288
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:27,440
They set up a supervisory office

289
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,790
with plenty of justification.

290
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:32,080
Reporting to Director Ding

291
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:33,790
probably won't help.

292
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,440
I've read your report.

293
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,240
You think Liang Shuo can be of use to us.

294
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,030
Although there was a minor incident during the loyalty test,

295
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:49,150
in the subsequent operations,

296
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,510
I still saw Mr. Liang's loyalty.

297
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:55,440
Including the matter with Ma Yuan's family,

298
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,320
and Lu Xijian's defection,

299
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:01,550
all indirectly confirmed what Liang Shuo said that day.

300
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:03,720
Ma Yuan

301
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,910
is indeed connected to the Military Command.

302
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:09,750
I understand.

303
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:12,000
You think Liang Shuo is useful, right?

304
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:13,670
Liang Shuo is the best.

305
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:15,550
If we don't make good use of him,

306
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:17,270
it would be a real pity.

307
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:27,000
Put your current deals

308
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,150
on hold for now.

309
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,600
Pause them for the time being.

310
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,240
If the Japanese get any leverage on us again,

311
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:35,630
we'll be at a disadvantage.

312
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:40,630
Yes.

313
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:41,750
Understood.

314
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:46,480
The peace conference is about to begin.

315
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,270
The position of deputy director

316
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:49,960
also needs to be decided soon.

317
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:52,750
It's not that I don't trust your judgment,

318
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:55,200
but this matter is too important.

319
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:58,080
The chosen person must not only be highly competent,

320
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,200
but also have a background

321
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,720
that commands respect from everyone.

322
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,870
The Deputy Minister of Finance of the Wang government

323
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:06,150
has Mr. Zeng Zhaolin vouching for him.

324
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:08,550
There shouldn't be any major issues with Liang.

325
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:11,870
Alright, there's still time.

326
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:13,600
We can observe a bit longer.

327
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:15,480
Understood.

328
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:26,750
Brother Cui,

329
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:27,960
is something the matter?

330
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,840
You were right.

331
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,870
The director is already suspicious of the Japanese's actions.

332
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:33,910
He's become alert.

333
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:36,080
The smuggling operation

334
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,630
needs to be put on hold.

335
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,670
How do you plan to leak this to Hirata Xizi?

336
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,120
Are you really going to help me with this?

337
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:48,320
I've already set up the warehouse at Lianjia Alley.

338
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:49,750
Since the Japanese want to investigate,

339
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:51,360
let them investigate to their heart's content.

340
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:56,870
If you trust me, Brother Cui,

341
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,480
let me handle this.

342
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:05,270
How could I not trust you?

343
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:11,960
Brother,

344
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:13,110
I'll leave it to you.

345
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,160
A letter from Liang Shuo.

346
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:43,880
Assemble immediately.

347
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,680
Prepare for action.

348
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,440
Yes.

349
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:50,680
Miss Hirata.

350
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:51,590
I won't let you down.

351
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:54,160
I've already identified all the smuggling activities of headquarters.

352
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,480
They were all carried out through the Lianjia Alley dock.

353
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,350
Dock number 15.

354
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:59,160
And the ownership of warehouse 26.

355
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,310
Both belong to headquarters.

356
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:02,240
Director Liang's efficiency

357
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,680
is truly impressive.

358
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:06,070
So, what clues have you found?

359
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:07,720
It's not exactly a clue.

360
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,720
I found that the headquarters' warehouse

361
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,070
was transferring a batch of firearms.

362
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:12,270
It might be related to Chongqing.

363
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:14,000
If we can trace their origin,

364
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,640
we might make an unexpected discovery.

365
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,790
Perhaps,

366
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:18,750
it's connected to the mole within headquarters.

367
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:22,510
On the surface, Chongqing and Nanjing are at war,

368
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:24,750
but behind the scenes, they're both making money.

369
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:28,070
It's quite a spectacle in history.

370
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:30,960
So, how many people does Director Liang need?

371
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:32,590
The warehouse is huge.

372
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:33,550
It's not easy to inventory.

373
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:35,480
The more people, the better.

374
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:37,350
But I need to keep this confidential.

375
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:39,400
I can't use people from headquarters' operations department.

376
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,510
Don't worry.

377
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:43,750
I'll send the nearby military police over.

378
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,960
Director Liang's loyalty

379
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:48,310
is something I've truly felt.

380
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,030
Looking forward to working together.

381
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:54,880
Sir

382
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,480
You came at just the right time.

383
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,160
Come with me for a trip.

384
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:00,200
To the Lianjia Alley dock.

385
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,310
Lead the Second Military Police Squad on duty.

386
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,270
Sir

387
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:07,110
The Second Squad is currently conducting a search at Pingjia Lane.

388
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:07,790
This—

389
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,920
Catching the anti-Japanese elements

390
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,440
is the top priority.

391
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,240
Please keep that in mind.

392
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:16,400
Understood.

393
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,270
Assemble.

394
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,720
Get in the vehicle.

395
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:31,160
Hurry up.

396
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,640
Faster, faster.

397
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:41,830
Shadow's plan succeeded.

398
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,160
The military police have been diverted.

399
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:45,270
Immediately arrange for the brothers to move the explosives.

400
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,000
Yes.

401
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:32,880
Is that Liang Shuo?

402
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,200
Judging by the figure,

403
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,310
it doesn't really look like him.

404
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:39,510
It really doesn't look like him.

405
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:43,310
Why hasn't he shown up yet?

406
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:48,440
Everything's been arranged.

407
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:49,200
The usual place.

408
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:49,920
Okay.

409
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:40,830
What's going on?

410
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:42,400
There are no shipments sent directly to Chongqing.

411
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,830
No firearms were found either.

412
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,960
It's just some ordinary smuggled goods.

413
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:47,400
Sir,

414
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,830
we filed a report in advance.

415
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:50,480
That's why we brought in so many people.

416
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,960
But

417
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:54,350
Director Liang,

418
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,880
your intelligence

419
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,240
seems to be inaccurate.

420
00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:00,000
The information was leaked.

421
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:05,160
For the warehouse inspection,

422
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:07,400
I used only my most trusted subordinates.

423
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,440
Other than reporting to Officer Hirata,

424
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:11,790
I didn't communicate with anyone else.

425
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:16,960
Could it be

426
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,720
the phone?

427
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:23,110
The internal phone lines at headquarters

428
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:25,400
are occasionally monitored by the communications department.

429
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:28,200
In that case,

430
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,550
the scope of our suspicion

431
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:30,960
can be further narrowed down.

432
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:32,240
Director Liang,

433
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,000
are you so sure

434
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,590
that our inspection of these goods

435
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,880
is connected to those infiltrators?

436
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,240
Are you doubting my source of information?

437
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:41,830
I just want to know

438
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:42,830
Director Liang,

439
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:45,550
how did you obtain this intelligence?

440
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:47,440
Director Liang,

441
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:48,880
it would be best

442
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:50,790
if you could explain.

443
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,590
Sir, would you like to listen to some music?

444
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:01,070
Who are you?

445
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:02,750
Let's go.

446
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:19,550
I haven't used a rifle in a long time.

447
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:25,400
I don't even know if I can still do it.

448
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:28,640
No one will laugh at you whether you hit the target or not.

449
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:30,070
No need to make any preparations in advance.

450
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,510
If she wasn't useful to keep alive,

451
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:36,680
I'd really want to shoot her.

452
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:41,750
This could be a trap.

453
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:49,310
We've fallen into their trap.

454
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,590
Protect Officer Hirata!

455
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:51,920
Who fired the shot?

456
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:52,920
I don't know.

457
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:53,680
Let's go take a look.

458
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,480
Yes, yes.

459
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,310
Such a good gun,

460
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,680
and it's wasted on him.

461
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:07,310
There's an assassin! Protect the officer!

462
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:08,680
The assassin is to the southwest!

463
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,110
Southwest!

464
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:11,510
Go catch them!

465
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,400
The infiltrator saw through our setup.

466
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,030
Their target is you.

467
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:42,590
Brother.

468
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:43,350
Wake up.

469
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:44,790
What happened?

470
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:53,640
Team leader.

471
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,880
It seems we've walked into a trap.

472
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:02,830
Team three, go after them!

473
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:03,550
The rest of you, follow me!

474
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:04,110
Yes!

475
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,030
Retreat!

476
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,200
Surround them!

477
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:23,550
Any findings?

478
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:26,350
Sir.

479
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:28,790
We found the assassin's coat and gun.

480
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:30,750
What did he say?

481
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:32,880
The murder weapon has been found.

482
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:35,200
Chief Hirata.

483
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,590
Now you believe what I said, right?

484
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,110
This person...

485
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,350
Really went to great lengths.

486
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,400
Who is it?

487
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,110
Hurry, go!

488
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:48,440
Quick, follow the chief!

489
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,240
Hurry!

490
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:08,830
Chief

491
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:11,400
Where is Chief Hirata right now?

492
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,350
We lost him.

493
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:14,310
Yes, sir.

494
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:32,200
Come with me, quickly.

495
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:32,880
Yes, sir.

496
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:40,110
Get out of the way

497
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:08,510
Run!

498
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:13,030
Faster!

499
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:23,550
Bastard.

500
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:24,800
What did you do?

501
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,110
Sir.

502
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:27,190
Sir.

503
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:28,190
Sir.

504
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:30,480
Wait until she wakes up.

505
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,880
Then you'll know who saved her.

506
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,030
Water.

507
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:35,880
Sir.

508
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:37,230
Sir.

509
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,070
Put down the gun.

510
00:35:26,510 --> 00:35:27,360
Take a look.

511
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:34,960
As expected.

512
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,280
This was planned for a long time.

513
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:39,840
Here.

514
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,800
This is the room where he was hiding before.

515
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,550
Very professional.

516
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:46,030
Whether it was the preparations beforehand

517
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:47,710
or the timing of the attack,

518
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,710
this assassin

519
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:54,800
is truly arrogant.

520
00:35:58,550 --> 00:36:00,400
He does have the skills to be that confident.

521
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:11,480
Even when we're both in the dark,

522
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:13,190
how did he

523
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:16,230
figure out our positions?

524
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,510
In the instant from light to darkness,

525
00:36:19,030 --> 00:36:21,280
the human eye can't adapt immediately.

526
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,630
So he prepared blackout curtains.

527
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:25,030
And he hid here in advance

528
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:27,360
just to get used to the darkness.

529
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:30,670
The moment the lights went out,

530
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:31,710
he chose

531
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:33,710
to strike when we were least able to adapt.

532
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,280
Shanghai.

533
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:40,440
To have such a skilled assassin...

534
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:43,000
Scorpio.

535
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,510
Other than Scorpio,

536
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:52,550
I can't think of anyone else with such ability.

537
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,880
If it is Scorpio,

538
00:36:58,670 --> 00:36:59,710
why

539
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,840
would he know about our operation?

540
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:06,360
Director Hirata, do you really need to ask me that?

541
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:09,840
The assassin's ambush at Jiangfeng Restaurant failed.

542
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:12,070
Then they sent someone to lure us here.

543
00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:14,190
Isn't it obvious?

544
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:21,030
Who was the assassin at Jiangfeng Restaurant?

545
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:23,230
It's been found out.

546
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,800
He's from the Special Operations Headquarters' communications team.

547
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:32,440
Chen Gengsheng.

548
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,480
Return to Special Operations Headquarters immediately.

549
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:38,400
Understood.

550
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:45,440
Director Li

551
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,030
There's something

552
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:49,150
I'd like to report to you.

553
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,800
Ms. Hirata, please go ahead.

554
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:54,280
Supervising disciplinary violations at the Special Agent Headquarters

555
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,440
is my responsibility.

556
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:58,440
The goods found in the warehouse tonight

557
00:37:58,670 --> 00:38:00,360
may be involved in smuggling.

558
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:01,440
Perhaps

559
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,360
it might also implicate

560
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,400
senior staff at the Special Agent Headquarters.

561
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,150
Ms. Hirata

562
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:10,840
if you have something to say, just say it directly.

563
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:14,320
I'm just informing you in advance, Director Li.

564
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:17,880
If, during the future investigation,

565
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:20,190
it involves people from the Special Agent Headquarters,

566
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:21,030
Director Li,

567
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:22,840
you'll be mentally prepared.

568
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:25,000
So you won't be too surprised.

569
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:29,400
Since it's just a suspicion for now,

570
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:31,190
let's wait until

571
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,320
the evidence is conclusive

572
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,550
before discussing it further.

573
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:37,670
That's fine.

574
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:43,670
Everyone, get out.

575
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:45,320
Go.

576
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:46,960
What are you doing?

577
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:49,630
What are you all doing?

578
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:51,590
Arrest Chen Gengsheng.

579
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:52,880
Detain the others.

580
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,190
No one is allowed in or out of the communications room.

581
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:54,880
Arrest me?

582
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:55,880
On what grounds?

583
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,440
Whose orders are you following?

584
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,000
On what authority?

585
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:58,920
Chen Gengsheng.

586
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:01,110
You'd better behave yourself.

587
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:03,510
It's in your best interest.

588
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,550
I'm asking whose orders you're following.

589
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:06,670
Director Hirata.

590
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,510
Liang Shuo.

591
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,030
It's Liang Shuo.

592
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:14,960
I want to see the director.

593
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,070
I want to see the director.

594
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:21,550
Calm down.

595
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:30,670
Let go.

596
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,280
Chief Chen.

597
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:35,880
Explain yourself.

598
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,280
What’s going on?

599
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:38,480
Director.

600
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,230
I’ve been wronged.

601
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:42,030
Help me!

602
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:45,400
Whether you’ve been wronged or not is another matter.

603
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,280
You’re asking for help right away.

604
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,670
It seems Chief Chen knows very well

605
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,440
what he has done

606
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,920
and what consequences it will bring.

607
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:54,000
Sir.

608
00:39:55,070 --> 00:39:56,800
I fell into Liang Shuo’s trap.

609
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,510
Please believe me.

610
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,230
Director Liang has been with me the whole time.

611
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,320
If it weren’t for him,

612
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:04,800
I would have died in the Lianjia Alley warehouse.

613
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:07,110
I only trust my own eyes.

614
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:09,030
He set this up!

615
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:09,760
Enough.

616
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:11,070
I’m asking you:

617
00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:13,320
Where is Scorpio?

618
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,030
I don’t know anything about Scorpio.

619
00:40:17,030 --> 00:40:18,150
At the scene,

620
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:20,920
the people who tried to assassinate Miss Hirata and Liang Shuo

621
00:40:21,070 --> 00:40:22,320
were your subordinates.

622
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:24,190
That’s a fact, isn’t it?

623
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:28,070
They’re not my people!

624
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:34,840
My man was badly set up by Liang Shuo.

625
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,070
This subordinate of mine

626
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:41,510
was supposed to make a fake contact with Liang Shuo.

627
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:43,440
He had already shown a flaw.

628
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:44,760
But unexpectedly,

629
00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:47,360
Liang Shuo set me up.

630
00:40:47,630 --> 00:40:48,670
Are you saying

631
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:50,960
Director Liang is a Chongqing agent?

632
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,190
What proof do you have?

633
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:54,960
Where is the evidence?

634
00:40:56,030 --> 00:40:57,510
The evidence is still being collected.

635
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:00,030
I was about to get it.

636
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:02,150
Please give me a little more time.

637
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:04,230
So what Group Leader Chen means is

638
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,920
Director Li secretly

639
00:41:07,150 --> 00:41:09,190
instructed you to investigate Director Liang.

640
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:16,840
I've always known that Group Leader Chen

641
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:18,150
has a sharp tongue.

642
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,000
You're best at twisting the truth.

643
00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:21,880
I've really learned something new today.

644
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:22,800
But I didn't expect

645
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,760
you'd come up with such a poor excuse.

646
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:26,550
It's truly disappointing.

647
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,190
Liang Shuo,

648
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:30,190
don't think I don't know

649
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:33,960
Group Leader Chen,

650
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,480
if you want to bark like a dog,

651
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,510
you'd better keep your eyes open.

652
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:40,480
If your teeth aren't strong, don't bite hard bones.

653
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:42,710
Even children understand that.

654
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:44,800
Why can't you learn it?

655
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:45,670
Liang Shuo, you—

656
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:51,150
Director.

657
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:52,480
Director.

658
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:56,030
I have something important to report to you privately.
