1
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:54,799
Chief

2
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,159
Here are the documents you requested.

3
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:08,319
The latest autopsy report for the Yulongshan case.

4
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:10,120
It seems different from what was previously stated.

5
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:11,199
Please take a look.

6
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,319
Director Liang

7
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:30,680
Liang Shuo

8
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:37,120
Before I answer this question,

9
00:02:38,919 --> 00:02:39,879
I also have a question

10
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:42,319
that I'd like to ask everyone.

11
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,240
What is it?

12
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,000
May I ask, sirs,

13
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:49,960
has anyone conducted a thorough background check on Ma Yuan'an?

14
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,000
Of course.

15
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,439
Everyone who joins the Special Operations Headquarters

16
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,879
must go through

17
00:02:55,879 --> 00:02:57,159
a strict screening process.

18
00:02:57,479 --> 00:02:58,400
Liang Shuo

19
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,400
Ma Yuan'an is already dead.

20
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,240
Looking into a dead person's file

21
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,639
what's the point?

22
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,520
Because of this

23
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:16,479
it's closely related to the person you're investigating

24
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:17,800
it's closely connected

25
00:03:22,759 --> 00:03:23,479
Is that so?

26
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,199
What Director Hirata means is

27
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,919
eight days ago

28
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,159
the initial report from Yulong Mountain showed

29
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:37,439
all five people at the scene died

30
00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:38,400
and there were also

31
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:40,520
traces of the assassin leaving

32
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:43,840
but because Director Liang returned

33
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,599
things have changed

34
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:49,319
the investigation team has overturned the previous conclusion

35
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:50,800
Director Liang is alive

36
00:03:51,159 --> 00:03:52,159
which proves

37
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,039
the traces left at the scene

38
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,199
weren't from a sixth person at all

39
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,280
Director Liang

40
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,599
how do you explain this?

41
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,080
The assassin we're investigating

42
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,560
couldn't be you, could it?

43
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,360
I originally hoped

44
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,520
Director Hirata would support my point of view.

45
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:18,040
I didn't expect to reach such a conclusion.

46
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,720
It seems that person

47
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:22,279
is far more cunning than I imagined.

48
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,600
That person

49
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:26,920
Director Liang,

50
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,839
are you still insisting on the idea of a sixth person?

51
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,600
It's just as Director Hirata said.

52
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:36,040
There was no sixth person at the scene.

53
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:38,000
No sixth person.

54
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,399
Then how did all of this happen?

55
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:42,160
How did these people die?

56
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,360
I killed them.

57
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:49,720
Liang Shuo.

58
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:51,839
So you admit

59
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,759
that you are an anti-Japanese agent?

60
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:55,759
Director.

61
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:56,519
Shut up.

62
00:04:57,079 --> 00:04:57,920
Liang Shuo.

63
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,279
Explain yourself clearly.

64
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,040
May I ask, Team Leader Chen,

65
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:05,399
which of my words admitted that I am an anti-Japanese agent?

66
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,560
Then what did you mean just now?

67
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,560
What did I mean?

68
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,399
Team Leader Chen, don't you understand?

69
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:11,480
I understand very well.

70
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,360
You killed them with your own hands.

71
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:15,639
If you are not an anti-Japanese agent,

72
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:17,439
then are they?

73
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,680
That's right.

74
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:34,439
Ma Yuan'an betrayed us.

75
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,240
How is that possible?

76
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,480
Quiet.

77
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,160
Go on.

78
00:05:42,519 --> 00:05:43,399
Twenty days ago,

79
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,600
Ma Yuan'an and I were ordered to escort the key criminal Yan Jiu

80
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,399
to Harbin Station to return to Shanghai.

81
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,199
Unexpectedly, on the way,

82
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,600
something happened.

83
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,759
Stop the car up ahead.

84
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:23,199
Team Leader Ma.

85
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,360
What do you mean by this?

86
00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:26,959
What do you mean?

87
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:28,399
Sorry.

88
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,720
Director Liang.

89
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:34,600
I don't want to do this either.

90
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,000
But I have no choice.

91
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:38,079
The higher-ups gave strict orders.

92
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,720
They told me to do whatever it takes.

93
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,120
To rescue Mr. Yan.

94
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,160
So you’re a Military Intelligence Bureau undercover agent.

95
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,319
You...

96
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,720
Unfortunately, you got caught up in this.

97
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,399
I feel sorry about it too.

98
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,920
But don’t worry.

99
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,399
I found a spot for you.

100
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:56,000
A cemetery with good feng shui.

101
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,480
Everything happened so fast at that time.

102
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,279
It was so fast that I didn't even have time to think.

103
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:50,839
Director.

104
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,680
The driver in the car

105
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,199
and who was the other person?

106
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,000
Ma Qibao and Gong Biao.

107
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,680
They both work for Team Leader Ma.

108
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:04,279
Why was it arranged this way?

109
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,279
Well,

110
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,399
isn't it

111
00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:08,680
also to fulfill

112
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,399
Chief Mizuno's test for Liang Shuo?

113
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,480
According to the rules,

114
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,839
during the assessment period,

115
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:15,480
when Director Liang goes on a mission,

116
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:18,600
he can't bring any of his close subordinates.

117
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:21,759
We also followed the suggestion of the Mei Agency

118
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,240
to make

119
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,519
such arrangements.

120
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,720
In such a desperate situation,

121
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:33,200
how did Director Liang

122
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,240
manage to survive?

123
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,120
All I can say is

124
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:44,519
it was a narrow escape from death.

125
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:18,120
Liang Shuo

126
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:18,960
What are you doing?

127
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,720
Put your hands up.

128
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,000
Put the gun down.

129
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,840
Who sent you?

130
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,559
Director Liang, impressive skills.

131
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,159
Even in such a situation,

132
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,799
you can still counter your opponent.

133
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,519
Truly remarkable.

134
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:53,879
This is indeed the most dangerous situation I've ever faced.

135
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,679
I've suffered too many injuries.

136
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,480
Surviving is already a stroke of luck.

137
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,360
I can only say my luck isn't too bad.

138
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,960
Director Liang's words

139
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,159
are truly impressive.

140
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,080
But now, the dead can't testify.

141
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,360
How do we know it was Ma Yunan who betrayed us

142
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,360
and not you, Director Liang?

143
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,879
May I ask, Leader Chen,

144
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,879
why would I do such a thing?

145
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,080
Let me ask you, Director Liang,

146
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,120
do anti-Japanese agents

147
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,399
need a reason for their actions?

148
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,279
Just as Leader Chen said,

149
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:54,559
no reason is needed.

150
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:56,600
But it should at least make sense, right?

151
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I have three questions

152
00:11:58,159 --> 00:12:00,159
that I'd like to ask Leader Chen.

153
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:01,200
First,

154
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:02,960
under strict guard,

155
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,039
rescuing someone is extremely difficult.

156
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,159
Why wouldn't I make thorough preparations

157
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:07,759
and then, at

158
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:09,320
the most unsuitable time and place,

159
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,519
carry out a suicide mission?

160
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:13,200
Second,

161
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,080
after the incident,

162
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,519
I could have easily escaped.

163
00:12:15,559 --> 00:12:17,200
Why would I return to Shanghai?

164
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,240
Wouldn't that be walking right into a trap?

165
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:21,240
Third,

166
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,639
Ma Yuan betrayed us

167
00:12:22,759 --> 00:12:24,559
to save Yan Jiu.

168
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:25,679
But my betrayal

169
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,360
was to kill Yan Jiu.

170
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,919
May I ask, Chief Chen,

171
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,919
what was my motive?

172
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,559
The person is already dead.

173
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:42,840
How you explain it

174
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,519
is entirely up to you, isn't it?

175
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:47,840
What evidence do you have to prove

176
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:50,279
that Director Liang is lying?

177
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:52,279
Does he have evidence to prove

178
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:53,279
it's true?

179
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,960
Since Chief Chen mentioned evidence,

180
00:12:55,159 --> 00:12:56,559
there actually is someone

181
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,720
who can testify for me.

182
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,000
Who?

183
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:01,840
Yan Jiu.

184
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,559
Isn't Yan Jiu dead?

185
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:07,840
First you want to check the dead person's file,

186
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:10,360
now you want a dead person to testify.

187
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:13,320
Can you give us a reason?

188
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:14,919
Don't forget,

189
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:17,720
the dead can't lie.

190
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,559
Yan Jiu

191
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,919
died by my gun.

192
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,759
Miss Hirata

193
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,759
What Director Liang said

194
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,360
is it true?

195
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,519
Based on the situation at the scene

196
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,360
the one who killed Yan Jiu

197
00:13:41,879 --> 00:13:44,159
used a nine-millimeter bullet.

198
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,919
We checked,

199
00:13:46,279 --> 00:13:48,480
and it's the same as the one used to kill Ma Yunan and Ma Qibao.

200
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,559
It's identical.

201
00:13:52,759 --> 00:13:53,559
That's correct.

202
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,159
Director Liang

203
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,759
When you returned to Shanghai,

204
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:01,000
why didn't you

205
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,159
report to me immediately?

206
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,120
I'm talking to you.

207
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:10,919
Director.

208
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,279
I was seriously injured at the time.

209
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,879
My mind was confused for a moment.

210
00:14:14,919 --> 00:14:15,720
First,

211
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,320
I didn't know why Ma Yuan betrayed us.

212
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,159
Second,

213
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:22,120
I was afraid.

214
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,240
Afraid.

215
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:24,679
What are you afraid of?

216
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:29,559
I thought you understood, Director.

217
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,320
You're afraid

218
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,720
that besides No. 76,

219
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:37,120
Ma Yuan also has people in the Military Police.

220
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,080
How dare you!

221
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:39,519
Who does he think he is?

222
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,919
Does he really have that much power?

223
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:42,120
Yes.

224
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:42,799
Indeed.

225
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:44,000
He

226
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,600
isn't that capable.

227
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,399
But, Miss Hirata,

228
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:48,759
Director Liang's concerns

229
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:50,960
I can understand.

230
00:14:53,799 --> 00:14:55,919
Ma Yuan's identity hasn't been fully investigated.

231
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,600
If I came back,

232
00:14:57,799 --> 00:14:59,720
I would only be suspected.

233
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:01,240
Anyone in my place

234
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:04,639
would probably want to prove their innocence first.

235
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:05,919
Besides,

236
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,759
if I returned rashly,

237
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,960
I might have already fallen victim to a villain.

238
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,720
Director Liang is truly talented.

239
00:15:17,879 --> 00:15:19,200
He remains calm in the face of change.

240
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,759
And handles things with composure.

241
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:21,840
However,

242
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,440
I have one last question.

243
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:28,360
If Director Liang can answer it,

244
00:15:28,919 --> 00:15:32,200
I'll believe what you said is true.

245
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,120
Chief

246
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,639
Come closer

247
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:43,320
Yes

248
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,200
Look carefully

249
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:49,279
Is he

250
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:51,480
the person you met at Ruijin Building and Tailong Chamber of Commerce

251
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:52,960
the one you encountered

252
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:53,759
Yes

253
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:08,879
It's him

254
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:26,080
Director Liang

255
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,399
He said he saw you at Ruijin Building

256
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:29,960
and Tailong Chamber of Commerce

257
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,399
He met you at both places

258
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:33,759
Can you explain this?

259
00:16:36,519 --> 00:16:37,720
I did go

260
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:40,080
to Ruijin Building and Tailong Chamber of Commerce

261
00:16:40,279 --> 00:16:41,519
I mentioned before

262
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:44,519
Ma Yuan and the person you are investigating

263
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:46,039
are closely connected

264
00:16:46,279 --> 00:16:47,960
That person didn't show up at the scene

265
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:50,320
but that doesn't mean he didn't come to Shanghai

266
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:53,480
After escaping from Yulong Mountain

267
00:16:53,559 --> 00:16:56,120
I discovered the whereabouts of a mysterious agent

268
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,440
I followed him all the way from Manchuria back to

269
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:03,200
Director

270
00:17:04,039 --> 00:17:05,440
There are some key things

271
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:08,519
I want to speak with you alone

272
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,279
and report to Chief Hirata

273
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,880
You all should leave as well

274
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:37,920
Chief Chen

275
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,599
You look like something's on your mind.

276
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,400
Do I look like I have something on my mind?

277
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,160
Leave some room for others in life.

278
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,440
So you can meet again on good terms in the future.

279
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:51,920
Chief Chen

280
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:54,680
Go ahead.

281
00:17:54,759 --> 00:17:56,759
Why can't you understand this principle?

282
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,799
Director Liang

283
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:02,599
You can talk now.

284
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,759
Officers,

285
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:10,279
have you heard of the codename Scorpio?

286
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,000
Go on.

287
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,799
Ma Yuan rebelled at Yulong Mountain.

288
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,759
I suspect the mastermind behind it is this Scorpion.

289
00:18:24,759 --> 00:18:26,799
What does this have to do with you entering the Ruijin Building

290
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,599
What's the connection?

291
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,680
What do you think, Director Hirata?

292
00:18:36,599 --> 00:18:37,519
Are you saying

293
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:40,559
Scorpion is also in the Ruijin Building?

294
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,400
Yes.

295
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:45,160
He is tracking down the whereabouts of that batch of explosives.

296
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:46,799
So in other words,

297
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:49,079
your previous appearances at the Tailong Chamber of Commerce

298
00:18:49,079 --> 00:18:50,559
and near the Yan Residence

299
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:52,400
were also to track Scorpion?

300
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,000
Director Hirata,

301
00:18:56,519 --> 00:18:57,599
forgive my recklessness.

302
00:18:58,079 --> 00:18:59,440
At the Ruijin Building,

303
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,079
I injured two Japanese soldiers.

304
00:19:02,759 --> 00:19:04,599
Director Liang acted out of necessity.

305
00:19:08,599 --> 00:19:09,680
You didn't go for the kill.

306
00:19:10,519 --> 00:19:12,079
I think that's already very considerate.

307
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,599
Liang Shuo,

308
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:17,920
as for the truth of the matter,

309
00:19:18,119 --> 00:19:21,400
I still need to conduct a thorough investigation.

310
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,440
Of course.

311
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,279
However,

312
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:29,079
regarding Chief Chen's overstepping,

313
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:30,640
Director Li,

314
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,400
you still owe me an explanation.

315
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,200
Alright.

316
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:36,680
Someone, come in.

317
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:37,720
Director.

318
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,799
Chen Gengsheng is still waiting outside.

319
00:19:39,799 --> 00:19:40,480
Let him in.

320
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,119
Yes.

321
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:51,680
Secretary Wang

322
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,839
According to the regulations of the Special Agent Headquarters

323
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,039
This is insubordination

324
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:56,119
and abuse of private punishment

325
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,839
What punishment should be given?

326
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:59,319
Insubordination

327
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,400
A major demerit

328
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,039
and half a year's salary deduction

329
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,839
Abuse of private punishment

330
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,279
requires suspension

331
00:20:05,559 --> 00:20:07,079
Depending on the severity

332
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,240
it should be reported to the Central Executive Committee

333
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:11,200
for the committee to decide

334
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:11,960
Team Leader Chen

335
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,799
I'll do you a favor

336
00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:15,559
Let's skip the suspension

337
00:20:16,039 --> 00:20:17,720
Central Executive Committee

338
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,920
I won't report it either

339
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,640
However

340
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,839
All the suffering Director Liang endured before

341
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:25,440
and all the punishment he took

342
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:28,960
you have to experience it all yourself

343
00:20:30,279 --> 00:20:31,079
Director Liang

344
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,000
What do you think about this

345
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,039
How about it?

346
00:20:36,039 --> 00:20:37,920
Since the Director has said so

347
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,519
if I keep holding on to this

348
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:43,039
it would be a bit ungrateful

349
00:20:44,039 --> 00:20:45,039
As for the punishment

350
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:46,160
let's skip it

351
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,079
for the Director's sake

352
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,400
let's just let this matter go

353
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:58,119
You should properly thank

354
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,480
Director Liang for his generosity

355
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,599
Thank you, Director Liang

356
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:07,960
You may go

357
00:21:16,519 --> 00:21:17,319
Team Leader Chen

358
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,720
Director Cui

359
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,160
You waited here on purpose

360
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,799
just to watch me make a fool of myself.

361
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,200
You're so clever,

362
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,400
what do you think?

363
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,640
Aren't you ridiculous enough already?

364
00:21:38,519 --> 00:21:39,640
There are a few things

365
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,200
I'd like to advise you about.

366
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:42,680
Secretary Wang,

367
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:44,039
hurry and arrange a car

368
00:21:44,119 --> 00:21:46,440
to take Director Liang to the hospital for a checkup.

369
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,480
No need, Director.

370
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:48,720
I'm fine.

371
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,480
I just need to go back and rest.

372
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,880
If that's the case,

373
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
then for the next few days,

374
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,200
don't go home yet.

375
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,880
Stay at headquarters

376
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,119
and get some proper rest.

377
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,640
That's fine too.

378
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:02,880
Thank you, Director.

379
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,279
That piece of meat you're eyeing

380
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,079
isn't easy to bite into, is it?

381
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,000
In this bureau,

382
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,160
everyone wants a piece of the action.

383
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,640
You're not the only one with an appetite, Chen Gengsheng.

384
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,480
What I want to tell you is,

385
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:21,359
no matter who you want to go after,

386
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,519
don't be so hasty.

387
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:42,079
Director

388
00:22:42,079 --> 00:22:43,279
Do you trust him?

389
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:47,279
Based on the clues we have,

390
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,319
what Liang Shuo said today

391
00:22:49,319 --> 00:22:51,200
didn't seem out of place.

392
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,079
Miss Hirata,

393
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,400
what do you think?

394
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:00,119
Yesterday, from Ma Yuan's residence,

395
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:02,240
the people who were arrested

396
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,200
were indeed from the military intelligence.

397
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,119
But aside from that,

398
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,720
there's no other evidence

399
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,920
to prove Ma Yuan's identity.

400
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,759
Then let's investigate Ma Yuan's two subordinates

401
00:23:14,839 --> 00:23:16,039
for more clues.

402
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,440
However,

403
00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:18,599
according to the intelligence,

404
00:23:18,839 --> 00:23:20,200
the codename "Scorpio"

405
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:23,680
does seem to have become active again recently.

406
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,880
That's true.

407
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,160
Miss Hirata,

408
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,319
I know you still have doubts.

409
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:31,319
But I think

410
00:23:31,319 --> 00:23:34,480
since Yan Jiu was indeed killed by his gun,

411
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,119
that means his motive is not in question.

412
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:40,000
As long as he passes the follow-up investigation,

413
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,599
we can discuss again

414
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,119
whether to drop our suspicions about him.

415
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:48,519
It's clear

416
00:23:49,559 --> 00:23:50,759
Director Liang

417
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,559
is indeed talented.

418
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:55,319
The Director truly values talent.

419
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:25,680
Boss

420
00:24:27,759 --> 00:24:28,319
Boss

421
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:42,319
Director Liang

422
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,240
Daily necessities, bedding, and sheets

423
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,720
have already been prepared for you.

424
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,559
Please get some rest.

425
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:50,759
Sorry for the trouble.

426
00:24:52,079 --> 00:24:52,599
Please.

427
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:09,680
Director Liang's daily life and routines

428
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:11,599
You must keep them in mind

429
00:25:11,599 --> 00:25:12,359
Yes

430
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,720
Wait at the door for instructions

431
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,880
Lately,

432
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,079
this headache

433
00:26:23,079 --> 00:26:24,759
has been getting worse.

434
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,279
Director, this is from overworking.

435
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,319
Plus,

436
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:29,839
it's caused by lack of sleep.

437
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:32,079
You should keep your diet light on regular days.

438
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,240
Is there something on your mind lately?

439
00:26:37,319 --> 00:26:38,799
Everyone here,

440
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:40,400
not a single one lets me rest easy.

441
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:42,799
Prescribe me a bit more

442
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:43,640
Ismailin.

443
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,279
Alright.

444
00:26:44,279 --> 00:26:45,519
I'll bring it to you later.

445
00:26:47,759 --> 00:26:48,559
Director.

446
00:26:48,839 --> 00:26:50,200
As you instructed,

447
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,279
everything has been arranged.

448
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,200
Director.

449
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:54,960
I'll be going now.

450
00:26:55,119 --> 00:26:55,640
Okay.

451
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:53,799
Who

452
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:55,839
The operations director of Unit 76

453
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:56,880
Liang Shuo

454
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,880
He was the assassin at Yulong Mountain

455
00:27:59,079 --> 00:28:00,559
He attacked the entire convoy

456
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:01,839
He also killed Yan Jiu

457
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:04,680
Why

458
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:06,160
I'm puzzled too

459
00:28:07,079 --> 00:28:08,680
His behavior was very abnormal

460
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:10,920
I

461
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,440
don't know how to describe it

462
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:13,799
Lao Tan

463
00:28:13,799 --> 00:28:14,680
Don't get the wrong idea

464
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:16,440
I haven't had anything to do with him for a long time

465
00:28:16,759 --> 00:28:17,599
Running into him

466
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:19,000
was really just a coincidence

467
00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:20,240
Fei Man

468
00:28:21,559 --> 00:28:23,240
Your previous romantic relationship with him

469
00:28:23,359 --> 00:28:24,480
was reported to the organization

470
00:28:24,759 --> 00:28:25,640
On this matter

471
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,440
the organization trusts you

472
00:29:01,559 --> 00:29:02,599
You just said

473
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,640
Liang Shuo's condition is a bit unusual

474
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,480
Why

475
00:29:05,839 --> 00:29:06,799
I don't understand

476
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,880
He clearly has credentials from the Special Agent Headquarters

477
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:10,839
So why is he running from pursuit

478
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,079
He even

479
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,640
was near the Yan residence

480
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,839
and attacked the Japanese

481
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,680
There was also a young woman with him

482
00:29:18,839 --> 00:29:20,119
She said he had a head injury

483
00:29:20,319 --> 00:29:22,000
That might be the reason

484
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:25,000
But I haven't been able to confirm it yet

485
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,279
Then

486
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,519
What about the young woman

487
00:29:28,599 --> 00:29:30,480
We were tailed by agents from No. 76

488
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:31,920
So we split up later

489
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,440
This whole thing is too strange.

490
00:30:17,839 --> 00:30:18,640
The Japanese

491
00:30:19,079 --> 00:30:20,160
Number 76

492
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,319
are all arresting people.

493
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:22,920
But the ones they're arresting

494
00:30:23,559 --> 00:30:24,799
are actually their own people.

495
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:27,720
What's even stranger is

496
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,240
Mr. Gu from Chongqing

497
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:31,000
came to buy information about Liang Shuo from me.

498
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:32,759
That Mr. Gu from the Military Bureau

499
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:34,480
Gu Chengchun

500
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,119
And

501
00:30:36,519 --> 00:30:37,400
he also said

502
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,640
he would be staying in Shanghai for a long time.

503
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:40,640
So

504
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,720
what about Scorpio?

505
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:44,559
It's very likely he came to Shanghai as well.

506
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,079
This matter

507
00:30:48,359 --> 00:30:49,880
is definitely not that simple.

508
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:50,960
Fei Man

509
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,480
right now

510
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,640
find out Liang Shuo's whereabouts.

511
00:30:54,759 --> 00:30:55,559
Keep a close eye on him.

512
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,119
We must get to the bottom of

513
00:30:57,279 --> 00:30:58,680
what exactly is going on here.

514
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,920
Who locked up our boss?

515
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,319
Why aren't we allowed in?

516
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:12,839
Even if he did something wrong,

517
00:31:12,839 --> 00:31:14,000
there should be evidence.

518
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:14,759
If there's no evidence,

519
00:31:14,759 --> 00:31:15,640
who has the right to detain our boss?

520
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,200
They're just making things hard for me, Yu Mazi.

521
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:18,799
Go back, Yu.

522
00:31:19,759 --> 00:31:21,319
It's the director's order.

523
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,079
Besides, it's not imprisonment.

524
00:31:23,079 --> 00:31:24,319
It's definitely not imprisonment.

525
00:31:24,319 --> 00:31:25,480
It's just a restriction on movement.

526
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,920
Waiting for investigation and evidence collection.

527
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:28,279
What do you mean by investigation and evidence collection?

528
00:31:28,839 --> 00:31:30,720
So if there's no result in a day,

529
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,640
our boss has to be locked up for another day, is that it?

530
00:31:32,839 --> 00:31:33,640
Bai,

531
00:31:33,799 --> 00:31:35,359
we're not sure about that.

532
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:36,920
Stop talking.

533
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:38,440
We can't afford to waste our time either.

534
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,480
You collect your evidence.

535
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:40,799
We have work to report.

536
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:41,480
Get out of the way.

537
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,200
Get lost.

538
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:43,720
What are you arguing about?

539
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:44,880
Director Liang.

540
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:45,319
Boss.

541
00:31:45,319 --> 00:31:45,720
They...

542
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,440
Get out!

543
00:31:47,119 --> 00:31:48,119
Don't make things worse here.

544
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,200
Thank you, Director Liang.

545
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,359
I know this isn't your responsibility.

546
00:32:02,359 --> 00:32:03,480
Go to the records room.

547
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,880
Bring me a batch of files.

548
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:05,640
But...

549
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,680
This doesn't follow procedure.

550
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,119
So now what I say

551
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:10,119
you don't have to listen to anymore, is that it?

552
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,160
What files do you need?

553
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,519
I need to ask the director for approval.

554
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,359
All personnel files.

555
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:17,720
Yes.

556
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:25,480
Director.

557
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:28,880
Should we give him the files?

558
00:32:29,319 --> 00:32:30,240
Give them to him.

559
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,319
Let's see what he wants to do.

560
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:34,559
Understood.

561
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,599
Director

562
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,200
said

563
00:32:50,319 --> 00:32:51,119
Director

564
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:53,440
called Secretary Jiang in Nanjing

565
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,319
Back then, Director Liang was in Nanjing

566
00:32:55,319 --> 00:32:57,279
and he really did know Miss Jiang from before

567
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,920
but the two of them broke up years ago

568
00:33:01,759 --> 00:33:02,559
And you?

569
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:03,319
Director

570
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,160
sent someone to the Mei Office to ask around

571
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:06,200
Mr. Mizuno

572
00:33:06,279 --> 00:33:08,039
did indeed give Miss Jiang a pistol

573
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,599
Quite a few people know about this

574
00:33:10,839 --> 00:33:11,799
Jiang Feiman

575
00:33:12,279 --> 00:33:13,759
Let the Japanese investigate it themselves

576
00:33:13,839 --> 00:33:15,440
We don't need to get involved in this mess

577
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:18,839
There's another thing

578
00:33:19,599 --> 00:33:21,759
That girl's background is unknown

579
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,119
Guys

580
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:24,799
couldn't find her

581
00:33:26,079 --> 00:33:26,720
I really have

582
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,599
raised a bunch of useless good-for-nothings

583
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,559
You can't even find a single girl

584
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,680
If word of this gets out

585
00:33:33,599 --> 00:33:34,839
I won't be able to keep my job as Director

586
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:35,480
Director

587
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,319
We really did our best

588
00:33:37,359 --> 00:33:39,240
We searched this whole area

589
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,160
That person vanished into thin air

590
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:41,720
Gone

591
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,279
Map

592
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,559
From the meeting point

593
00:33:58,559 --> 00:33:59,839
to these two alleys

594
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:01,799
it's not far, right?

595
00:34:02,039 --> 00:34:02,519
Yes.

596
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,760
When did you two come to headquarters?

597
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,559
I came in February last year.

598
00:34:11,079 --> 00:34:12,320
I came in June last year.

599
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,000
So that means

600
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:18,480
neither of you are rookies anymore.

601
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,280
I am incompetent.

602
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,920
I'm not blaming you.

603
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,239
The director means

604
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,519
this girl's identity is not simple.

605
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,280
It concerns Director Liang's innocence.

606
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:35,119
I don't care what methods you use.

607
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:36,280
I only want results.

608
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,159
Even if you have to turn these streets upside down

609
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,400
you must find her.

610
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,239
Yes.

611
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,199
Also,

612
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,679
the new recruits trained by the General Affairs Department

613
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:47,159
transfer a few to Director Liang.

614
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:49,000
If he asks about it,

615
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:50,760
just say it's the chief's decision.

616
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,760
Understood.

617
00:34:59,079 --> 00:34:59,880
The mission—

618
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:02,480
You must understand what a mission is.

619
00:35:02,719 --> 00:35:03,760
Complete it.

620
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,039
Do your utmost.

621
00:35:05,039 --> 00:35:07,039
Even if it costs your life.

622
00:35:07,559 --> 00:35:08,320
Liang Shuo.

623
00:35:09,079 --> 00:35:11,280
You must sort things out.

624
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,119
Director Liang.

625
00:35:14,119 --> 00:35:15,599
I've brought the files you requested.

626
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,639
Put them on the table.

627
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:28,159
For the next two hours,

628
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:29,119
do not disturb me.

629
00:35:29,159 --> 00:35:29,679
Yes.

630
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:29,639
Drinking tea, drinking tea

631
00:36:30,159 --> 00:36:32,440
Reading the newspaper, drinking tea

632
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,480
Drinking tea, drinking tea

633
00:36:36,119 --> 00:36:38,079
Reading the newspaper, drinking tea

634
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,239
Drinking tea, drinking tea

635
00:36:41,639 --> 00:36:43,000
Reading the newspaper

636
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:46,719
Drinking tea

637
00:36:46,719 --> 00:36:48,719
Reading the newspaper, drinking tea

638
00:37:52,119 --> 00:37:52,639
Stand properly.

639
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:03,039
These three,

640
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,039
are new recruits sent to us from above.

641
00:38:05,719 --> 00:38:06,599
This is Team Leader Yu.

642
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:07,760
Hello, Team Leader Yu.

643
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:09,599
I'm handing them over to you.

644
00:38:10,199 --> 00:38:10,800
Old Bai,

645
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:14,760
we're not short on people here.

646
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:15,480
The higher-ups keep

647
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:17,239
sending us these useless people, for what?

648
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:19,199
Do they really think this is a boot camp?

649
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,159
Are you stupid?

650
00:38:20,719 --> 00:38:21,800
Were they forced onto you?

651
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,920
They were forced onto our boss.

652
00:38:24,119 --> 00:38:25,400
The higher-ups say we're understaffed.

653
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,199
Isn't that just because

654
00:38:26,199 --> 00:38:28,039
the Yulong Mountain incident is over?

655
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:30,119
They're just trying to make things difficult for our boss.

656
00:39:16,679 --> 00:39:17,920
Confess quickly.

657
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,599
Bastard.

658
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:31,000
Since we caught him until now,

659
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,159
we've used every form of torture.

660
00:39:33,159 --> 00:39:34,599
But he still hasn't said a word.

661
00:39:34,599 --> 00:39:36,159
To deal with someone like this,

662
00:39:36,159 --> 00:39:37,480
instead of physical torture,

663
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:41,239
it's better to use psychological tactics.

664
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:42,679
Let him down.

665
00:39:42,719 --> 00:39:43,360
Yes.

666
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:44,280
Chief.

667
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,280
This person

668
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,440
is very dangerous.

669
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,119
I'm not afraid.

670
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:48,280
Do as I say.

671
00:39:48,599 --> 00:39:49,119
Go.

672
00:39:50,039 --> 00:39:51,079
Bring a chair.

673
00:39:51,199 --> 00:39:52,000
Yes.

674
00:40:04,159 --> 00:40:05,800
There is no greater sorrow than a dead heart.

675
00:40:06,639 --> 00:40:08,880
I completely understand how you feel right now.

676
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,239
Mr. Lu,

677
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,199
Codename: Scholar.

678
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:15,559
The famous Twin Assassins within the intelligence agency.

679
00:40:16,039 --> 00:40:17,719
A decade-long career as a spy.

680
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,880
An impressive and distinguished record.

681
00:40:20,599 --> 00:40:21,599
If

682
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:23,679
all Chinese scholars were like you,

683
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,360
that would really give me a headache.

684
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,639
What else do you know?

685
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:31,119
I want to know

686
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:32,960
why you

687
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,639
had contact with Ma Yuan.

688
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:36,599
Is he part of the intelligence agency?

689
00:40:38,039 --> 00:40:39,119
No need to say so much.

690
00:40:40,199 --> 00:40:41,440
If you want to kill or torture me,

691
00:40:42,559 --> 00:40:43,480
just get it over with.

692
00:40:43,559 --> 00:40:44,639
You don't want to talk, do you?

693
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,239
That's fine.

694
00:40:46,679 --> 00:40:47,760
I'll tell you.

695
00:40:48,639 --> 00:40:49,639
Catching you

696
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,119
is my honor.

697
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:52,719
My predecessor

698
00:40:52,719 --> 00:40:55,360
Mr. Miyazaki tried to capture you seven times.

699
00:40:55,519 --> 00:40:56,960
But he failed every time.

700
00:40:57,199 --> 00:40:59,079
To show my appreciation,

701
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:01,000
I have something for you.

702
00:41:02,119 --> 00:41:03,000
Bring the telegram.

703
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:03,480
Yes.

704
00:41:12,639 --> 00:41:13,719
I believe

705
00:41:13,719 --> 00:41:14,960
after you read it,

706
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:17,119
you'll surely appreciate my generosity.

707
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:19,760
You should know

708
00:41:20,159 --> 00:41:21,760
this is your telegram.

709
00:41:36,519 --> 00:41:37,519
Call the military doctor.

710
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:38,719
Treat him.
