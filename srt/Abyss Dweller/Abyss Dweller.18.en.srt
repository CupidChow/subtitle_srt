1
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:49,400
How is it?

2
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:51,359
What did Director Lu do today?

3
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,560
He was in the office the whole time.

4
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:53,760
He just went out once in the middle.

5
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:54,719
Where did he go?

6
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:55,560
To Geluoxi Road.

7
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,159
What about now?

8
00:01:59,239 --> 00:02:00,120
He's in the office.

9
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:02,120
Boss, do you want me to keep watching him?

10
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:03,319
No need.

11
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:05,799
You go back and rest first.

12
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:06,719
Okay, boss.

13
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:07,840
Then I'll come pick you up tomorrow.

14
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:15,599
Why is this mission so rushed?

15
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:16,439
Don't ask so many questions.

16
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:17,199
Xiao Si

17
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,360
You have to go, whether you want to or not.

18
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:20,599
This is an order from the teacher.

19
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:21,599
It must be completed.

20
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:22,479
Senior brother

21
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:23,560
After we finish the mission

22
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,759
let's meet at the agreed location.

23
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,039
Come on.

24
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:28,800
Cover it up.

25
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,439
Brother

26
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,000
Have we been betrayed?

27
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:32,719
Otherwise, the Japanese couldn't have arrived so quickly.

28
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:33,520
No way.

29
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,360
The teacher wouldn't make a mistake.

30
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:37,520
Don't hand me over to the Japanese.

31
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,759
Don't.

32
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,800
Hurry.

33
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,520
Hurry up!

34
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:42,599
I'll take you.

35
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,240
Your superior, Scorpio

36
00:02:47,719 --> 00:02:49,520
clearly knew that Ma Yuan was not in Shanghai

37
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,639
but still sent you

38
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:53,159
to meet with Ma Yuan.

39
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:54,759
Using your sacrifice

40
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,319
to exchange for control of the Shanghai station.

41
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:00,759
Your persistence is meaningless.

42
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:02,960
Don't you want to take revenge

43
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,759
for your party and your superior?

44
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,479
Lu Xijian

45
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,280
Traitor to the country

46
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:18,960
Xiao Si

47
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,560
Let's go.

48
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,360
I want to know.

49
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:23,680
Say it.

50
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,000
Sir

51
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:47,639
After you.

52
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:50,840
Alright.

53
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:21,800
Stop up ahead.

54
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:22,759
Okay.

55
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:05,399
We've already sent our men to scout that location.

56
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:06,360
The place is well hidden.

57
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,399
It's far from No. 76 and the military police.

58
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,879
Our lookouts have been watching for a long time.

59
00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:11,399
No suspicious people have been found nearby.

60
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,240
Being cautious is a good thing.

61
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:14,959
Also,

62
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:17,360
Since Lu Xijian joined No. 76,

63
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,399
his behavior has been erratic.

64
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,600
He has repeatedly put Liang Shuo in danger.

65
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,759
Student,

66
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:22,839
I'm worried about his condition.

67
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,399
Being too cautious

68
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:26,759
is just overthinking.

69
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,639
Yes.

70
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,600
Who is guarding the entrance?

71
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,560
Xiao Qi and the others.

72
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,360
Lu Xijian has already arrived.

73
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,439
He's waiting for us.

74
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,519
Let's go through the front door.

75
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,080
Put the gun down.

76
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,279
Senior brother.

77
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,159
Stop.

78
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,000
Long time no see.

79
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,159
Is your leg better?

80
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:33,799
Did you see that?

81
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:35,159
How do you feel now?

82
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,440
It seems between us

83
00:09:37,639 --> 00:09:38,919
there have been some misunderstandings.

84
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:39,720
Misunderstandings.

85
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,559
What does our life mean to you?

86
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,120
You tell me.

87
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,879
Don’t you want to explain what happened with Qi Xiaosi?

88
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,279
Why did you do it?

89
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,600
Qi Xiaosi had to die.

90
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,440
Don’t you understand?

91
00:09:55,559 --> 00:09:57,759
This is the price we have to pay.

92
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,879
With your former identity,

93
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:02,200
you wanted to gain Mizuno Shingen’s trust.

94
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,320
This was the only way.

95
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,639
He could have left.

96
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:10,799
He really could have left.

97
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:12,080
But he killed himself for me.

98
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:12,960
So,

99
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,759
that’s how we gained Mizuno’s trust.

100
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:15,879
It let you survive.

101
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,399
That’s how you got your current position.

102
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:21,360
Stop.

103
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,080
Don’t move.

104
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:26,200
This is

105
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:29,039
what I owe them.

106
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,480
You can

107
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:38,519
hit me a few more times.

108
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:39,600
Teacher.

109
00:10:54,919 --> 00:10:56,039
Have you finished venting?

110
00:10:56,679 --> 00:10:58,159
If you're done venting,

111
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,879
then it's my turn to settle a score with you.

112
00:11:02,679 --> 00:11:03,759
I've told you before,

113
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,480
Shadow is Liang Shuo.

114
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,240
Since he's already returned,

115
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:09,879
why did you attack him at Jiangfeng Restaurant?

116
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,960
You even deliberately leaked information,

117
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:14,000
letting the people from Dafengtang hunt him down.

118
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,600
Don't think I don't know

119
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,399
about your little tricks.

120
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:19,120
If it were someone else,

121
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,440
I would have already treated him as a traitor

122
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,679
and let him rot in the Huangpu River.

123
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:25,879
Don't let your personal desires

124
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,720
ruin the entire Snow Blind plan.

125
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:32,840
Back then,

126
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:34,159
I found you in a pile of corpses

127
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:35,440
and carried you out.

128
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,919
You were barely alive.

129
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,960
You followed me since you were fourteen.

130
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:40,679
I'll never forget

131
00:11:40,759 --> 00:11:42,000
when I gave you a steamed bun

132
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,879
and the look in your eyes as you devoured it.

133
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,159
Eyes like a wolf.

134
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:48,080
At that moment, I knew

135
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:50,039
that you would one day become

136
00:11:50,039 --> 00:11:51,360
a loyal agent.

137
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:53,879
Among all my students,

138
00:11:54,919 --> 00:11:56,879
you are the one most like me.

139
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:03,639
I trust you

140
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:04,519
but that doesn't mean

141
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:06,639
you have the right to act recklessly

142
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:07,519
Yes

143
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:09,600
I did order someone to hunt him down

144
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,200
If he dies

145
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,799
it proves he isn't capable of leading the Snow Blind Project

146
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,240
I can complete the mission without him

147
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,960
It's not that I haven't considered

148
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,200
letting you take the lead

149
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,240
It's just that

150
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:24,600
he's been undercover for so long

151
00:12:24,759 --> 00:12:26,240
with his current identity

152
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:28,759
it's easier for him to get close to the core of the storm

153
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:30,279
I just hope now

154
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:32,200
he can become a blade that pushes us forward

155
00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:33,279
That's all

156
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:34,960
I know

157
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:36,440
about the deaths of our brothers

158
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,679
you've always been conflicted

159
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,279
But

160
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,000
if we

161
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,200
sabotage the Japanese peace plan

162
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,600
we'll get the attention of Chongqing

163
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,480
By then

164
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,039
all our brothers' blood debts

165
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,559
can be settled with the Japanese

166
00:12:52,759 --> 00:12:54,399
I hope you can assist me

167
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,600
I want your help

168
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,279
The most important thing now

169
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,879
is to ensure the Snow Blind Project is carried out safely

170
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:04,399
Having come this far

171
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,360
we can only move forward

172
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,360
there's no turning back

173
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,519
Now that Liang Shuo has been promoted to the Special Investigation Division

174
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:13,399
you must fully cooperate with him

175
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:14,799
Do you understand?

176
00:13:27,559 --> 00:13:29,080
I want you to keep a close eye on him.

177
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:32,120
The teacher hopes

178
00:13:33,039 --> 00:13:34,600
you can be my eyes.

179
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:38,879
The teacher only trusts you.

180
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,279
Alright.

181
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,120
Today,

182
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,480
you made an exception to meet with me.

183
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:59,039
There must be more to it than just this, right?

184
00:13:59,799 --> 00:14:00,440
Go ahead.

185
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,320
What other important information do you have?

186
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:05,159
Chengchun,

187
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,200
please step out for now.

188
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,240
Before leaving Ma Yuan's apartment,

189
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,639
I searched the apartment carefully.

190
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,759
I also made an unexpected discovery.

191
00:14:54,039 --> 00:14:55,879
What did that letter say?

192
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,399
The Japanese already know

193
00:14:57,399 --> 00:14:59,159
that we want to sabotage the Peace Conference.

194
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:00,840
And after the Peace Conference,

195
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:03,039
there's another suspicious plan.

196
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,200
To remove obstacles to the Peace Conference,

197
00:15:05,799 --> 00:15:07,480
they had Ma Yuan leave Shanghai

198
00:15:08,039 --> 00:15:09,000
and go to Manchuria

199
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,480
to capture a Communist.

200
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:14,080
The Japanese are going to Manchuria

201
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,919
to capture Yan Jiu.

202
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,840
Is it possible that Yan Jiu is the Communist?

203
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,600
If Yan Jiu is the Communist,

204
00:15:24,919 --> 00:15:26,679
then he's hidden it very well.

205
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,000
For over ten years,

206
00:15:29,799 --> 00:15:31,240
he's kept it from me.

207
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,360
The so-called plan mentioned in Ma Yuan's letter—

208
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,159
what is it exactly?

209
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,840
Judging from the wording in Ma Yuan's letter,

210
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:42,879
it's a top-secret list.

211
00:15:43,799 --> 00:15:46,600
A list that was planned as early as ten years ago,

212
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,159
with Japanese agents planted

213
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:50,000
and spies who were turned.

214
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,039
Over ten years ago...

215
00:15:58,919 --> 00:16:00,240
What else do you know?

216
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,759
Tell me everything.

217
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:05,080
That's all I know for now.

218
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,360
Also,

219
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,080
although Hirata is dead,

220
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,799
while she was alive, she planted

221
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,759
an undercover agent named Guqu at the Special Operations Headquarters.

222
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:20,559
According to the chief's instructions

223
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:21,919
secret arrangements have already been made.

224
00:16:21,919 --> 00:16:24,159
The secret agent codenamed "Bone Maggot"

225
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:25,279
is monitoring the agent headquarters.

226
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:27,799
I believe that in the near future

227
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,840
the secretly arranged agent will, at a critical moment,

228
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:32,639
become the greatest help in rooting out the infiltrator.

229
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,960
He knows all of Hirata's operational plans before his death.

230
00:16:37,879 --> 00:16:39,279
If we don't eliminate him soon,

231
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:42,080
our undercover work will be threatened.

232
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:44,039
Whatever support you need,

233
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,919
I will cooperate at any cost.

234
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:11,400
What's wrong?

235
00:17:11,799 --> 00:17:13,880
Do you want to blame me too?

236
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,359
I've heard about it.

237
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:19,720
Xiao Si was his best friend since childhood.

238
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,519
You didn't have to send him.

239
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,359
Being too sentimental

240
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:27,400
will only make you weak.

241
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,480
Xiao Si, with his death,

242
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,279
taught him a valuable lesson.

243
00:17:30,279 --> 00:17:31,599
He should understand now

244
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:33,400
that this is the only way to complete the mission.

245
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:34,319
Teacher.

246
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,240
In your eyes,

247
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,160
are we all just chess pieces?

248
00:17:40,519 --> 00:17:41,839
There's nothing strange about that.

249
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:45,759
Aren't I the same?

250
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,240
Someone's here.

251
00:18:09,559 --> 00:18:11,519
You can come to me openly.

252
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:13,559
Why are you sneaking around by the wall?

253
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:16,200
To tell you the truth,

254
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:17,680
I'm not interested in what you have to say.

255
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,960
I really don't care at all.

256
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,160
But Lu Xijian has tried to kill me several times.

257
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,200
I have to figure out his true identity.

258
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:24,640
Now,

259
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:25,640
it's clear.

260
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:27,119
He'd better listen to you.

261
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:28,079
And cooperate obediently.

262
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,079
Otherwise,

263
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,640
I don't mind getting more blood on my hands.

264
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:48,759
What's going on?

265
00:18:48,759 --> 00:18:49,559
Why is it so urgent?

266
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:51,319
I have something important to report.

267
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,799
I just followed Lu Xijian.

268
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:54,920
And made a major discovery.

269
00:18:55,559 --> 00:18:56,960
Just as I suspected,

270
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,279
he's only pretending to defect.

271
00:18:58,279 --> 00:18:59,640
He's still taking orders from Scorpio.

272
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:01,200
And,

273
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,440
at Ma Yuan's apartment,

274
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,000
he found critical intelligence.

275
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,200
What intelligence?

276
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:07,400
The Trinity Plan behind the Peace Conference.

277
00:19:07,759 --> 00:19:09,880
It's a top-secret list of spies.

278
00:19:12,279 --> 00:19:13,440
Top secret list

279
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,440
Although I can't remember everything,

280
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,480
but Comrade Maple

281
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:21,960
very likely mentioned this list to me.

282
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,000
In fact, my infiltration into the Japanese side

283
00:19:24,519 --> 00:19:25,799
was not only for the Abyss Plan,

284
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:29,240
but also to find the whereabouts of this list.

285
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,680
What you said is extremely important.

286
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,039
I will immediately

287
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,240
report to the organization.

288
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,119
If it really was ten years ago

289
00:19:38,599 --> 00:19:40,440
that the Japanese arranged and turned people,

290
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,640
they could now be in key positions.

291
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,079
If they are activated,

292
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,519
the consequences would be unimaginable.

293
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,200
I will find a way

294
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,319
to quickly gather clues from the Central Committee.

295
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,799
Hirata Kiko has just passed away.

296
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,640
I heard

297
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:56,599
that the new successor,

298
00:19:56,599 --> 00:19:57,519
Takagi Yuuji,

299
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,079
is also a tough character.

300
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:01,480
You must be careful during this period.

301
00:20:01,799 --> 00:20:03,200
Don't act too hastily.

302
00:20:04,839 --> 00:20:05,599
I agree.

303
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,440
Previously, Hirata Kiko set up many undercover agents

304
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
to root out infiltrators in headquarters.

305
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,880
Although she is now dead,

306
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,240
the undercover agents remain.

307
00:20:15,559 --> 00:20:17,200
It's making it very difficult for me to move within.

308
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:19,240
It's hard to obtain further intelligence.

309
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,400
So now,

310
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,359
how do you need us to cooperate with you?

311
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,880
I want to ask the organization

312
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:30,960
to suspend all activities

313
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:31,960
and maintain silence.

314
00:20:32,279 --> 00:20:33,279
Unless absolutely necessary,

315
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:34,599
do not contact me.

316
00:20:34,759 --> 00:20:36,799
This is to avoid being discovered by undercover agents.

317
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:39,680
Alright.

318
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,359
Be careful in everything.

319
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:44,559
Don't worry.

320
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:47,839
Now that I know Lu Xijian's identity,

321
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,640
I will find a way

322
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:52,079
to have him and Scorpio help me eliminate the undercover agent.

323
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,319
Wait for my news.

324
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:17,279
Come here.

325
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,000
Sir.

326
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
What are your orders?

327
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,440
Director Li's office.

328
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:25,400
Lead the way.

329
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,319
Alright, alright.

330
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:27,079
This way.

331
00:21:28,759 --> 00:21:30,200
What an attitude.

332
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,319
Not as good as Hirata Kiko.

333
00:21:32,839 --> 00:21:35,119
I'm afraid things will only get worse from now on.

334
00:21:36,359 --> 00:21:38,400
The camp stays, but the soldiers come and go.

335
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,680
Just hang in there.

336
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:52,799
Mr. Mizuno is so busy,

337
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,640
yet he still managed to make timely arrangements.

338
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,599
It's truly a blessing for our Special Operations Headquarters.

339
00:21:57,759 --> 00:21:59,880
Director Li, we meet again.

340
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:01,640
Miss Hirata's accident

341
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,680
is something I deeply regret.

342
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:06,640
You call this fate, don't you?

343
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,359
From now on, her work

344
00:22:08,359 --> 00:22:09,720
will be fully taken over by me.

345
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:13,079
I originally wanted to pay my respects to Director Ding,

346
00:22:13,519 --> 00:22:15,119
but it seems unnecessary now.

347
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:18,559
Mr. Mizuno already told me over the phone.

348
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,359
Director Ding is also aware.

349
00:22:20,359 --> 00:22:21,559
It's just that Director Ding

350
00:22:21,559 --> 00:22:23,079
has several meetings coming up.

351
00:22:23,079 --> 00:22:24,480
He's coming and going in a hurry.

352
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,519
That's understandable.

353
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,119
Mr. Takagi,

354
00:22:27,319 --> 00:22:28,480
I hope you don't mind.

355
00:22:30,119 --> 00:22:30,960
Mr. Takagi,

356
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,440
although this isn't your first time at our headquarters,

357
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:35,839
you're still not very familiar with the place.

358
00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:37,240
In a moment,

359
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,799
I'll have Secretary Wang

360
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:40,400
assist you,

361
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,079
and show you around.

362
00:22:41,839 --> 00:22:42,799
Thank you.

363
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:43,599
Sorry for the trouble.

364
00:22:44,599 --> 00:22:45,359
Bring all the

365
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:46,720
personnel files from the Special Operations Headquarters.

366
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,279
Yes.

367
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:00,240
May the deceased rest in peace.

368
00:23:03,559 --> 00:23:04,160
Sir.

369
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:06,039
Should we clear out the office right away?

370
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,839
I don't intend to do that.

371
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,720
The cause of Hirata Kiko's death is still unknown.

372
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,000
The point of taking over this office is that

373
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,759
anything the deceased didn't have time to tell you

374
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,079
might be found in the documents she handled.

375
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:21,440
We might find some clues.

376
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,000
Then, Director Mizuno,

377
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,319
regarding Miss Hirata,

378
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,920
do you have any thoughts of your own?

379
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,079
There's only one lead.

380
00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:30,480
Hirata Kiko

381
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,119
once reported to Director Mizuno.

382
00:23:34,039 --> 00:23:35,359
The report shows

383
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:38,599
she planted someone at the Special Operations Headquarters

384
00:23:38,599 --> 00:23:40,240
an informant codenamed "Bone Maggot."

385
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,720
When Yan Jiu was arrested,

386
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:45,160
this person also provided crucial information.

387
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:46,839
This person

388
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:47,960
should know

389
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,920
what happened before Hirata died.

390
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:50,839
In other words,

391
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,559
as long as we find this person,

392
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,599
we'll understand the truth.

393
00:23:55,119 --> 00:23:56,680
But all the leads have gone cold.

394
00:23:57,319 --> 00:23:58,480
Finding him

395
00:23:59,799 --> 00:24:00,880
won't be easy.

396
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,240
Hello.

397
00:24:07,799 --> 00:24:08,599
Dr. Xu.

398
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,519
Sorry to trouble you.

399
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:12,799
From the director's office,

400
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:14,960
there was no notice about your visit today.

401
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,359
Please wait a moment.

402
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,839
I'll call the secretary's office to check.

403
00:24:17,839 --> 00:24:19,400
I'm here to see Director Liang.

404
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,640
I'm here to change his dressing today.

405
00:24:24,599 --> 00:24:25,920
As usual, let's sign in first.

406
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:26,559
Okay.

407
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,160
Perfect, I'll give a report.

408
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,359
Xiao Zhao, Xiao Zhao.

409
00:24:33,359 --> 00:24:34,240
Come here, come here.

410
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:36,319
You need something from me?

411
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,720
This is Dr. Xu.

412
00:24:38,839 --> 00:24:40,200
He's here to change Director Liang's dressing.

413
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,480
Take him in on your way.

414
00:24:42,079 --> 00:24:43,160
You're here to see Director Liang, right?

415
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,039
Yes.

416
00:24:44,079 --> 00:24:44,880
Please follow me.

417
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:46,640
Thank you.

418
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,359
This way, please.

419
00:24:49,839 --> 00:24:51,720
After all, all contact with Guqu

420
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,200
has been handled solely by Hirata Xizi

421
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,720
on her own.

422
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,640
We don't have detailed information on this person.

423
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,279
According to agent regulations,

424
00:24:59,799 --> 00:25:02,440
and considering that I have always been at odds with Hirata,

425
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:03,880
these could all be reasons

426
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,960
why he isn't contacting us for now.

427
00:25:06,599 --> 00:25:07,640
If we want to find him,

428
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,519
we need to approach it from a new angle.

429
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:14,319
That's why you came to look into the records, isn't it?

430
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,240
That's right.

431
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,079
This way, please.

432
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,240
Zhao Di

433
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:27,839
What's wrong?

434
00:25:28,519 --> 00:25:29,519
Please, you must help me.

435
00:25:29,519 --> 00:25:31,519
Give this document to Director Liang.

436
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:35,880
Who asked you to deliver this document?

437
00:25:36,039 --> 00:25:37,960
Director Li asked me to give it to Director Liang.

438
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:39,319
Alright, don't worry.

439
00:25:39,319 --> 00:25:39,920
I'll make sure it gets to him.

440
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:40,799
Okay, thank you.

441
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:41,440
Go ahead and get back to work.

442
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,000
Alright.

443
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,039
Xu

444
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:48,559
No, no, no.

445
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:49,680
Look.

446
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,960
Zhao Di is slacking off again.

447
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:54,599
No, Brother Yu.

448
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,880
Where is he?

449
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,319
Who do you mean?

450
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:02,079
Are you saying we're not people?

451
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,960
Brother Bai, that's not what I meant.

452
00:26:04,519 --> 00:26:05,160
Boss.

453
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,160
That doctor named Xu just now

454
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,200
said he wanted to change your dressing.

455
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:09,160
Then the guard, Old Hu, asked me to bring him up.

456
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:11,400
But I lost track of him and now he's gone.

457
00:26:12,519 --> 00:26:13,640
That's strange.

458
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,440
Alright, I got it.

459
00:26:15,759 --> 00:26:16,880
You guys get back to work.

460
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:17,200
Okay.

461
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,039
Got it, boss.

462
00:26:21,559 --> 00:26:23,359
Do you really think that by doing this

463
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:25,240
everything will go perfectly?

464
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,039
Hello.

465
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:45,759
Excuse me,

466
00:26:45,799 --> 00:26:47,880
where is the office of the new Chief Takagi?

467
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,359
You are...

468
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:50,119
Xiao Luo.

469
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,000
Zhou Chu.

470
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,720
Are the reports done?

471
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,759
They’re all finished.

472
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,000
Hurry and take them to the director.

473
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,279
Okay, I’ll go right away.

474
00:27:01,599 --> 00:27:02,559
Sir,

475
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:03,720
are you looking for

476
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:04,799
Chief Takagi?

477
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:05,759
Yes.

478
00:27:06,079 --> 00:27:07,599
His office is on the first floor,

479
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,640
the first room on the west side.

480
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,599
Alright, thank you.

481
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:49,680
Dr. Xu

482
00:27:50,319 --> 00:27:51,559
What brings you here?

483
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:54,559
Director Liang

484
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:57,079
I came to do your follow-up check.

485
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,000
But

486
00:27:58,359 --> 00:27:59,799
I left the medical kit in the reception room.

487
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,200
I found the kit,

488
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,000
but then I got lost.

489
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:02,960
I kept wandering around,

490
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:04,599
and ended up here.

491
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:07,400
This isn't the right place.

492
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,400
My office is on the second floor.

493
00:28:09,599 --> 00:28:10,720
If you're not familiar with this place,

494
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,079
you really shouldn't wander around.

495
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:14,400
If someone mistakes you for a spy and arrests you,

496
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,680
that would be a big problem.

497
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:16,400
No, no, that won't happen.

498
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:16,559
No, it won't.

499
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,960
Come on, let's go to my office.

500
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:20,079
You came at just the right time.

501
00:28:20,119 --> 00:28:21,279
My wound is hurting a bit.

502
00:28:21,319 --> 00:28:22,319
I'm afraid it might be infected.

503
00:28:26,119 --> 00:28:27,839
Dr. Xu even came here in person.

504
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,359
That's really very kind of you.

505
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,920
Director Liang is a very busy person.

506
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:33,960
Of course, I should be the one to come.

507
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:36,319
Otherwise, it would delay the work of the new government.

508
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,279
It's not all about work.

509
00:28:39,079 --> 00:28:40,720
Things have been unstable outside lately.

510
00:28:41,079 --> 00:28:42,680
Even Chief Hirata had an incident.

511
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:43,799
In any case,

512
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,759
safety always comes first.

513
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,400
Director Liang is right.

514
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:48,640
These are extraordinary times.

515
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,680
We can't let the officials

516
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,880
show themselves in public.

517
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,000
Your injury has healed quite well.

518
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:53,880
No need to worry.

519
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,200
Just make sure to get enough rest.

520
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,200
That's good to hear.

521
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,720
Wait a moment.

522
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,440
Lao Bai,

523
00:29:00,599 --> 00:29:01,039
come here.

524
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,359
It's not easy for Dr. Xu to come all this way.

525
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,920
You drive him yourself.

526
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:08,880
Take him back.

527
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,240
Alright.

528
00:29:10,599 --> 00:29:11,799
That won't be necessary, will it?

529
00:29:12,839 --> 00:29:14,559
Did you forget what I just said?

530
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,039
These are extraordinary times.

531
00:29:16,359 --> 00:29:17,599
Safety comes first.

532
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,119
Dr. Xu,

533
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:21,920
let's go.

534
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:23,640
Thank you.

535
00:30:22,839 --> 00:30:24,079
You noticed it too, didn't you?

536
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,079
This Xu Wen isn't that simple.

537
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,359
We can only say we were pretty lucky.

538
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,880
We stopped him before he could meet Takagi.

539
00:30:31,359 --> 00:30:32,960
I don't know how much he knows.

540
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:34,319
While you were in the hospital,

541
00:30:34,319 --> 00:30:35,440
he was fully in charge.

542
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,640
He definitely knows

543
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,799
that before Hirata died, he was suspicious of Nian Ci.

544
00:30:39,119 --> 00:30:40,720
The assassination of Hirata went too smoothly.

545
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,920
I've always felt uneasy about it.

546
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:47,039
Then let's get rid of Xu Wen as well.

547
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:48,240
To eliminate future trouble.

548
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,599
Old Bai is still in the car.

549
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,079
What?

550
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,200
Feeling sorry for your subordinate?

551
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,519
You really see yourself as a traitor now.

552
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,640
If you can't do it,

553
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:58,200
I'll do it.

554
00:30:59,319 --> 00:31:00,119
What?

555
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:01,960
Did you make a deal with Scorpio?

556
00:31:02,839 --> 00:31:04,240
I advise you not to act recklessly.

557
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:06,319
If Takagi finds out later,

558
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,839
he can still have us killed.

559
00:31:08,519 --> 00:31:10,720
You think I didn't know you followed me yesterday?

560
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:14,319
I'll give you one minute to think.

561
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:15,599
If you can't decide,

562
00:31:15,599 --> 00:31:16,519
then do as I say.

563
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,839
If I were Xu Wen,

564
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,400
I'd still go back to find Takagi Yuyi.

565
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:24,759
When we get out of the car later,

566
00:31:24,759 --> 00:31:25,880
we'll split up.

567
00:31:26,319 --> 00:31:27,359
Find a way to lure him to

568
00:31:27,359 --> 00:31:28,680
the warehouse at Shiliupu Dock.

569
00:31:29,799 --> 00:31:31,279
Why would he trust me?

570
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,319
If he doesn't trust you,

571
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:34,759
he's even more afraid of me.

572
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,240
You just need to tell him I want to kill him.

573
00:31:37,359 --> 00:31:38,720
He'll obediently go with you.

574
00:31:39,359 --> 00:31:41,400
Whether we can get rid of this tail today

575
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,319
depends on your acting skills.

576
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,759
I'll give you one minute too.

577
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:12,279
Dr. Xu

578
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:14,119
Where are we going?

579
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,160
Captain Bai

580
00:32:19,319 --> 00:32:20,160
I just remembered

581
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,640
I still have something to take care of

582
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,119
Otherwise, could you

583
00:32:24,119 --> 00:32:25,440
drop me off up ahead?

584
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,480
Please don’t

585
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,960
The boss instructed me

586
00:32:28,119 --> 00:32:29,559
to make sure you get there safely

587
00:32:29,839 --> 00:32:30,480
It’s fine

588
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,400
I can wait for you

589
00:32:31,799 --> 00:32:32,799
No need, no need

590
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,880
I wouldn’t want to trouble you, Captain Bai

591
00:32:35,359 --> 00:32:36,440
Please, just do as you wish

592
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,440
Alright

593
00:33:08,839 --> 00:33:09,640
Get in the car, quickly.

594
00:33:10,319 --> 00:33:11,119
Director Lu.

595
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:12,759
Liang Shuo wants to kill you.

596
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,279
Director Lu.

597
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:29,000
Why would Director Liang want to kill me?

598
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,000
Do you still not understand why?

599
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,240
I know you work for Director Hirata.

600
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,839
Did Director Hirata tell you that himself?

601
00:33:40,359 --> 00:33:41,720
Before Director Hirata passed away,

602
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,799
he asked me to investigate Liang Shuo and Miss Xie.

603
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:46,440
So of course, he told me everything.

604
00:33:47,559 --> 00:33:48,519
I see.

605
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,559
Director Hirata did suspect

606
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:52,200
that Miss Xie was anti-Japanese.

607
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:56,440
Director Lu said Liang Shuo wants to kill me.

608
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,039
Does that mean he’s also suspicious?

609
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,559
There’s no concrete evidence yet.

610
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,599
We can only say that Liang Shuo is highly suspicious.

611
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,039
I am also secretly

612
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:07,079
investigating this for Chief Mizuno.

613
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,840
But your actions today were too reckless.

614
00:34:10,119 --> 00:34:11,679
You barged straight into the special agents’ headquarters

615
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:13,119
to contact Mr. Takagi.

616
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:13,800
If you were exposed,

617
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,119
have you thought about the consequences?

618
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:18,079
It was my mistake.

619
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:19,280
I have always

620
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,320
been in direct contact with Director Hirata only.

621
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,440
Director Hirata died suddenly.

622
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:25,599
I have no authority to meet Chief Mizuno.

623
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:28,320
So I could only try to contact Mr. Takagi.

624
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:30,599
By doing this,

625
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,920
you made Liang Shuo even more suspicious.

626
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:34,599
If I hadn’t arrived in time,

627
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,880
his men would have already acted against you by now.

628
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:40,000
Thank you for saving me, Director Lu.

629
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,440
Where are we going?

630
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,719
I'll take you somewhere safe first.

631
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:49,719
Then

632
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:50,519
I'll figure something out.

633
00:34:50,519 --> 00:34:52,079
So you can meet with Mr. Takagi.

634
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:58,719
Isn't Mr. Takagi at the agency headquarters?

635
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,840
I'll find a way to get him to come out.

636
00:35:05,199 --> 00:35:06,000
Director Lu,

637
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:09,519
When Director Hirata mentioned me to you,

638
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,840
what else did he say?

639
00:35:13,559 --> 00:35:14,280
What do you mean?

640
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:16,119
Didn't he tell you

641
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,920
my code name or something like that?

642
00:35:22,119 --> 00:35:22,800
Bone Maggot.

643
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:24,880
Really?

644
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:29,880
Isn't it?

645
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:39,719
Hurry!

646
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,000
He's over there!

647
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:42,880
Go after him!

648
00:37:44,519 --> 00:37:45,440
Lu,

649
00:37:45,679 --> 00:37:47,280
you can't kill me.

650
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:50,039
Gunshots here will alert the nearby military police.

651
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:51,920
If you don't leave now,

652
00:37:52,199 --> 00:37:53,719
you won't get out of here alive.

653
00:37:54,719 --> 00:37:55,679
I really didn't expect

654
00:37:56,239 --> 00:37:58,599
you were actually working with Liang Shuo.

655
00:37:59,000 --> 00:37:59,920
What a pity.

656
00:38:01,639 --> 00:38:02,920
Once I get out of here,

657
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,880
and see Mr. Takagi,

658
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:07,960
I'll have both of you

659
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,320
sent to Target Hill for execution.

660
00:38:22,119 --> 00:38:22,840
Hurry!

661
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:24,000
Surround this place!

662
00:38:32,599 --> 00:38:33,440
Go in!

663
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:35,280
Hurry!

664
00:38:50,519 --> 00:38:51,719
Xu Wen's body has been found.

665
00:38:51,719 --> 00:38:52,760
Are you sure it's okay?

666
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:53,800
Half a month ago,

667
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,760
a Military Command warehouse was busted there.

668
00:38:56,159 --> 00:38:57,239
Xu Wen died there.

669
00:38:57,519 --> 00:38:58,719
With a little guidance,

670
00:38:59,159 --> 00:39:00,960
it will most likely be seen as a Military Command revenge act.

671
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:01,920
And the case will be dropped.

672
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:02,920
This reason,

673
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:05,039
you had already thought of it before you acted.

674
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:07,960
It's the best way to clear suspicion.

675
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,559
It seems he had good reason to choose you.

676
00:39:12,119 --> 00:39:13,920
You really are qualified to be my opponent.

677
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:20,159
I snuck into Hirata's office

678
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:23,400
and found a list of agents.

679
00:40:11,559 --> 00:40:12,599
Xu Wen is among them.

680
00:40:12,599 --> 00:40:13,920
But Xu Wen's name isn't listed.

681
00:40:15,159 --> 00:40:17,000
However, two pages are blank.

682
00:40:26,519 --> 00:40:27,360
I also found a letter

683
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,920
that was never sent.

684
00:40:29,559 --> 00:40:31,119
The letter was written by Hirata to Mizuno.

685
00:40:32,599 --> 00:40:34,719
It says a secret agent was planted at headquarters.

686
00:40:34,719 --> 00:40:35,119
It says a secret agent was planted at headquarters.

687
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:36,320
Codename: Bone Maggot.

688
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,159
Just before Xu Wen died,

689
00:40:39,159 --> 00:40:40,159
I tested him.

690
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,280
He seemed a bit hesitant.

691
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,719
Do you think it could be Xu Wen?

692
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:49,400
Xu Wen isn't really someone from the agent headquarters.

693
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,119
Bone Maggot.

694
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:54,719
A maggot clinging to the bone.

695
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,920
It should be someone close to us.

696
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:01,360
Who else around us could know so much?

697
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:03,079
Be more cautious.

698
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:05,199
It can save your life at critical moments.

699
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,519
Aren't you curious

700
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:08,960
how Hirata Kiko

701
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,320
managed, in such a short time,

702
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:11,920
to carry out a series of deployments?

703
00:41:14,719 --> 00:41:16,000
What worries me more now

704
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,079
is that after Hirata's death, this maggot

705
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,159
could report directly to Mizuno Shingen, bypassing the chain of command.

706
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:22,719
We still have time.

707
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,599
Mizuno Shingen went to Nanjing yesterday.

708
00:41:25,639 --> 00:41:26,760
He'll be back in three days.

709
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:28,079
Within these three days,

710
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,679
we need to root out this hidden spy.

711
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,119
Lu Xijian,

712
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,400
we need to work together.
