1
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,920
I believe

2
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,000
after you finish reading,

3
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:54,239
you will definitely appreciate my generosity.

4
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,319
You should know

5
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:58,319
this is your telegram.

6
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:04,680
Your superior, Scorpio,

7
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:06,959
clearly knew that Ma Yuan was not in Shanghai,

8
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,039
yet still sent you

9
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,639
to meet with Ma Yuan.

10
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,759
Using your sacrifice

11
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,360
to exchange for the takeover of the Shanghai station.

12
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:18,840
Your persistence is meaningless.

13
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,439
I won't kill you.

14
00:02:22,039 --> 00:02:23,280
As long as you cooperate with me.

15
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,639
Don't you want to take revenge for your party

16
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,599
and your superior?

17
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:30,840
Think it over carefully.

18
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:35,520
I'll be waiting for your answer.

19
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,960
Call the military doctor.

20
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:52,159
Treat him well.

21
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:17,599
Who is it?

22
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:23,879
It's you.

23
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:25,000
Miss.

24
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:25,759
Miss.

25
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,240
It's been three years.

26
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:32,039
You've grown into a fine young lady.

27
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,599
I hope you've been well.

28
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:36,199
Weren't you in Chongqing?

29
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:37,680
How did you end up in Shanghai?

30
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,159
I heard the Shanghai station

31
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:41,280
removed you from their list.

32
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,199
Yes.

33
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,520
I just couldn't stand it.

34
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,520
They use the Military Statistics Bureau's connections to profit from the country's misfortune.

35
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,639
You really haven't changed at all.

36
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,759
Always meddling in other people's business.

37
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:54,719
You think this is normal, don't you?

38
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:55,719
It's not normal.

39
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:58,560
But it's not surprising either.

40
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,879
Only by accepting the darkness of this society

41
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:03,840
can a person truly mature.

42
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,560
I've said it before,

43
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,759
intelligence work

44
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:10,199
isn't a child's game of playing house.

45
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,719
Now it seems

46
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:13,479
you're really not suited for this job.

47
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:14,520
It's also time

48
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,800
I sent you away.

49
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:18,199
Why?

50
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:19,600
Xie Jun'an.

51
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,759
It seems you don't have the authority to decide whether I stay or leave.

52
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:24,240
The Shanghai station has already removed you.

53
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,360
There's no reason for you to stay.

54
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,879
You tell me to come, so I come.

55
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,199
You tell me to leave, so I leave.

56
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:30,879
On what grounds?

57
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:32,240
Because I'm your uncle.

58
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,560
Your elder.

59
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,319
Your only family.

60
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,439
My only family.

61
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:37,360
Then he should know even more.

62
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,360
Why I came here.

63
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:39,360
What I want to do.

64
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:40,560
He shouldn't stop me even more.

65
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:42,279
It was your parents

66
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:43,560
who entrusted you to me.

67
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:44,560
You want me to leave.

68
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:47,120
Is it because you feel guilty when you see me?

69
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:48,600
You don't want to face me.

70
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,920
You don't want to face him.

71
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,199
That's why you want me to leave.

72
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,360
So,

73
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,399
you're avoiding me,

74
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:53,920
aren't you?

75
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:06,680
Xie Nianci

76
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:08,759
Don't forget

77
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:11,759
who raised you.

78
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:14,319
I haven't forgotten.

79
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:16,240
I think you're the one who forgot.

80
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,319
Who was it that raised you?

81
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,920
It was your older brother.

82
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,920
He raised you through hardship.

83
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:24,240
And how did you treat him?

84
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:26,680
You are real brothers.

85
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:29,680
You watched him die right in front of you.

86
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:30,839
It's been seven years.

87
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:32,439
Have you ever thought about avenging him?

88
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,360
Who told you this nonsense?

89
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,759
I'm telling you,

90
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,079
you're leaving today, no matter what.

91
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:40,199
Even if you don't want to, you have to go.

92
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:41,040
I'm not leaving.

93
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,120
Even if I'm just an ordinary person,

94
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,680
I still have the right

95
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,560
and duty to resist the Japanese.

96
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:47,560
Besides,

97
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:48,839
I might be able to help you.

98
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:50,319
I don't need your help.

99
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,959
What if it's a lead about No. 76?

100
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:00,160
I know someone

101
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,879
who is the operations director of Unit 76

102
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:02,920
named Liang Shuo

103
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:04,279
Maybe

104
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:05,959
he could be

105
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,560
my source of information

106
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:09,160
What did you say?

107
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,160
How do you know him?

108
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,199
You seem very interested

109
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:15,959
Tell me everything you know

110
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,120
Then let me stay

111
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,199
as a condition

112
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:22,240
I agree

113
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,519
Hurry up and talk

114
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:25,519
He and I

115
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:27,680
met during a mission

116
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,399
We were both being chased by Japanese military police

117
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:32,240
He was being chased by the Japanese military police

118
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,480
Why?

119
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,639
I don't know why the Japanese were after him either

120
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:36,639
But

121
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:38,360
it seemed he had a serious head injury

122
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,480
He couldn't remember anything

123
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:40,879
not even his own name

124
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:43,199
I only realized his identity when I saw Unit 76 take him away

125
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,600
That's how I confirmed who he was

126
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:52,560
Why are you so concerned about him?

127
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,240
Is he really one of us?

128
00:06:54,439 --> 00:06:55,000
Chengchun

129
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:55,879
Yanjia

130
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:01,279
Nian Ci has met Liang Shuo

131
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,120
Go find a way to gather some information

132
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:04,920
about Unit 76

133
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,680
Yes

134
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,519
Let's go

135
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:39,120
Brother Bai

136
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:41,519
The boss seems off this time after coming back.

137
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:43,800
He's just in a bad mood.

138
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,399
What happened?

139
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:48,199
He got criticized.

140
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,720
Isn't it because of Yulong Mountain?

141
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,199
Something big happened.

142
00:07:57,279 --> 00:07:58,800
They say the whole escort team

143
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,120
only our boss came back alive.

144
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:13,279
Oh, come on.

145
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,879
You're just jumping to conclusions.

146
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:15,920
Where did you hear that rumor?

147
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,720
How come I didn't know about it?

148
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:19,000
It's that guy from General Affairs again,

149
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:20,519
Jiang Shanji, right?

150
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,319
He's never been reliable.

151
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:23,600
What do you know?

152
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,639
He wasn't reliable before,

153
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:29,839
but that was about outside stuff.

154
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:31,680
This is internal business, okay?

155
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:33,600
Who's Jiang Shanji?

156
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,120
You guys know, right?

157
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,840
He has all the keys to our offices.

158
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,759
This is definitely first-hand information.

159
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:42,320
The boss went straight to the interrogation room as soon as he got back.

160
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:43,360
Before he went in,

161
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:45,840
the director and the Japanese were already waiting inside.

162
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:47,879
Who do you think they're interrogating?

163
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:48,960
Who?

164
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:50,919
Interrogate the Japanese, of course.

165
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,320
If you don't know, just shut up.

166
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,399
Isn't that nonsense?

167
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,039
The chief went on a mission,

168
00:08:56,279 --> 00:08:57,279
almost lost his life,

169
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,399
and now they're interrogating him?

170
00:08:58,639 --> 00:08:59,440
Exactly.

171
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:01,080
Is there any justice left?

172
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,519
What is justice?

173
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,799
Now the Japanese are justice.

174
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:12,240
If I want to survive,

175
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:15,399
it's not enough to clear myself of suspicion.

176
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:17,960
I also need to quickly prove my worth.

177
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:20,159
Finding Scorpion's whereabouts

178
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,759
is not just for

179
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:23,399
discovering my true identity,

180
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,960
but also to ensure that I can

181
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,120
survive at No. 76.

182
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:33,919
Hey, listen,

183
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,840
don't just sit there, guys.

184
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:36,919
Be proactive.

185
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,279
Show some concern, ask how he's doing.

186
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:39,399
Serve tea if you should.

187
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:40,559
Bring water if needed.

188
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,080
Liven up the atmosphere.

189
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,360
Who would dare take the risk at a time like this?

190
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:48,159
Why don't you go yourself?

191
00:09:56,159 --> 00:09:56,679
Hey, new guy.

192
00:09:57,799 --> 00:09:58,320
Here.

193
00:09:58,399 --> 00:09:59,200
Pour a cup of tea and take it in.

194
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,559
I... I...

195
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,399
Pour a cup of tea and take it in.

196
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,120
Just do as you're told.

197
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,320
Stop talking nonsense.

198
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,240
Yes.

199
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:20,600
Go on.

200
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,240
Go.

201
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:27,679
Come in.

202
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:29,519
Chief.

203
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:31,960
Chief.

204
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:37,240
Hello, Chief.

205
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:44,440
You.

206
00:10:45,159 --> 00:10:45,759
Reporting, Chief.

207
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,399
My name is Zhao Di.

208
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,080
I'm new here.

209
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,120
Chief, you must be thirsty.

210
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:51,960
Let me refill your water.

211
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:53,960
Alright.

212
00:10:54,039 --> 00:10:54,799
Thank you.

213
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,120
Chief, please enjoy.

214
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,519
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

215
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:13,440
The water spilled.

216
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:14,559
It spilled.

217
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:15,879
What else did he say?

218
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:16,879
Something's off.

219
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:19,120
It's really not right.

220
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:20,639
Say it.

221
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:21,080
Alright.

222
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:21,679
Thank you.

223
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,000
That's it.

224
00:11:24,039 --> 00:11:24,480
Just leave it here.

225
00:11:28,759 --> 00:11:29,320
Something's off.

226
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,519
It's really not right.

227
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,120
The boss usually doesn't kick us out.

228
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:32,919
That's already pretty good.

229
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:34,360
When has he ever been so polite to us?

230
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:35,320
Right?

231
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,440
No way.

232
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:40,519
I think the boss treats people

233
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:41,639
pretty nicely.

234
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,440
What does this have to do with you?

235
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:45,639
What nonsense are you talking about?

236
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,559
You two, take a squad

237
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:48,679
and wait for me in the lobby.

238
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,000
Okay.

239
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,320
That's more like it.

240
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,240
Now it feels right.

241
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:55,840
Let's go, let's go.

242
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,639
Grab your clothes.

243
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,200
Seriously, are you guys shameless or what?

244
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:01,399
Just look at you.

245
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,039
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

246
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:03,679
This isn't my clothes.

247
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:04,480
This is Ma Zi's.

248
00:12:04,679 --> 00:12:05,240
Ma Zi.

249
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,759
Everyone, get your gear ready.

250
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:09,279
Be ready to move at any time.

251
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,399
Yes.

252
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:15,679
Team Leader Chen

253
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,399
What are you doing?

254
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:19,519
Preparing to carry out the mission.

255
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:20,559
Carrying out the mission.

256
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,000
What operation are you preparing for?

257
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,440
Who authorized you?

258
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,799
Isn't this Chief Chen?

259
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:33,360
The operation was specially approved by Director Liang.

260
00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:34,360
What's the matter?

261
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,159
Your Director Liang is still under observation.

262
00:12:36,919 --> 00:12:38,360
How can he lead an operation?

263
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:41,840
That's strange.

264
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,840
Since when did the Telecommunications Unit

265
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,879
start interfering in our Operations Department's business?

266
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,720
Chief Chen's reach

267
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,759
is really getting a bit long.

268
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:52,519
You probably don't know yet.

269
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,360
This Chief Chen

270
00:12:54,519 --> 00:12:57,039
is about to be promoted to Director Chen.

271
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:58,759
If his reach

272
00:12:58,759 --> 00:12:59,799
gets a bit longer, so what?

273
00:12:59,799 --> 00:13:00,840
What's the problem?

274
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,759
He's getting promoted.

275
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:03,759
Congratulations!

276
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,120
But

277
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:06,279
he hasn't been promoted yet, has he?

278
00:13:06,279 --> 00:13:06,639
That's right.

279
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:07,679
Even if he gets promoted,

280
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:09,039
he'll still be on the same level as our Director Liang.

281
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:09,679
That's true.

282
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:10,840
Overstepping authority

283
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:13,279
doesn't sound good if word gets out.

284
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,840
Now you're just being petty, aren't you?

285
00:13:16,039 --> 00:13:17,159
How do you know our Director Chen

286
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:18,519
will stop at being a director?

287
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:20,480
His ambition is to become a chief.

288
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,080
Chief Chen!

289
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,360
Chief Chen.

290
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,320
When we get promoted in the future,

291
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,320
we'll need Chief Chen's support.

292
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,120
Come on, come on.

293
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,320
Hurry up and greet Chief Chen.

294
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,879
Hello, Chief Chen.

295
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,320
Your Director Liang

296
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,399
always disciplines his subordinates like this?

297
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:42,759
So fond of gossiping.

298
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,879
Do you want me to help you

299
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,320
cut your tongue out?

300
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:47,279
So you can chew it properly.

301
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:54,320
Take care, Director Chen.

302
00:13:54,679 --> 00:13:55,519
Safe travels.

303
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,120
Stop laughing, all of you.

304
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:02,639
Line up.

305
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:04,879
Count off.

306
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:07,440
One, two, three, four, five.

307
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:09,600
Just looking at the accounts,

308
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,759
there are no flaws.

309
00:14:11,879 --> 00:14:14,120
But when you compare the warehouse in-and-out slips,

310
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:15,919
you can spot the clues.

311
00:14:16,919 --> 00:14:17,919
That Military Bureau

312
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:19,879
right under our noses

313
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,399
is really running wild.

314
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:23,080
Director Liang,

315
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,519
just a simple tip-off

316
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:27,000
and you can spot so many problems.

317
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:27,960
Very good.

318
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,000
You’re full of energy right after coming back.

319
00:14:30,279 --> 00:14:32,240
A true role model for us all.

320
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:35,240
As long as Scorpio isn’t caught,

321
00:14:35,799 --> 00:14:36,679
I

322
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,679
won’t be at ease for a single day.

323
00:14:39,799 --> 00:14:40,600
Director,

324
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:44,799
I’ve already called the docks.

325
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,360
This is the schedule

326
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,120
for cargo ships arriving and departing over the past few days.

327
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:49,759
Take a look.

328
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:55,159
In an hour,

329
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,399
five cargo ships will arrive.

330
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:00,039
Let’s hurry and close the net.

331
00:15:01,799 --> 00:15:03,480
This isn’t a small operation.

332
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,200
To be on the safe side,

333
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:06,600
bring Cui Mo along.

334
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:07,600
Yes.

335
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,159
Team Leader

336
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:26,879
Team Leader

337
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,360
Team Leader

338
00:15:28,759 --> 00:15:30,000
They've already set out.

339
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,639
Search Liang Shuo's office.

340
00:15:38,039 --> 00:15:38,960
I want to see

341
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,759
what he did after he came back.

342
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:43,559
Yes.

343
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,480
He took out everyone's files.

344
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:22,879
What is he trying to do?

345
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:25,639
The people in the records room said

346
00:16:25,639 --> 00:16:27,720
Director Liang wants to review everyone's files.

347
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:29,159
That includes yours.

348
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:30,480
And his own as well.

349
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:37,399
His own file.

350
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,440
What is he trying to do?

351
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,399
Could it be

352
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,799
he's investigating a mole?

353
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,799
The more he tries to cover it up, the more obvious it becomes.

354
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:27,559
Looking at your own file

355
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,200
Brother

356
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,240
I haven't had a chance to congratulate you yet

357
00:17:54,599 --> 00:17:56,559
The director approving you to join this operation

358
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,559
shows that he still trusts you

359
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,559
Being in a place of suspicion

360
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,640
what's on your mind

361
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:05,279
is to make a contribution to prove your innocence

362
00:18:06,279 --> 00:18:07,200
By the way, Brother Cui

363
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,880
There's something I'd like to ask you

364
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:10,960
Go ahead

365
00:18:12,039 --> 00:18:12,920
Brother Cui said

366
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,440
The military police once searched Yulong Mountain

367
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,400
Did they find anything?

368
00:18:20,839 --> 00:18:22,319
Why are you suddenly asking about this?

369
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,599
Did you remember something?

370
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:28,079
For Ma Yuan to dare to defect at this point

371
00:18:28,759 --> 00:18:30,359
it's impossible that he didn't have help

372
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,160
Didn't they say two hunters were killed?

373
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,000
I'm thinking

374
00:18:36,039 --> 00:18:37,279
the military police

375
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:39,880
might have found something new

376
00:18:42,279 --> 00:18:43,480
The person leading the team that time

377
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,240
was named

378
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,039
Motegi Kazuhisa

379
00:18:48,359 --> 00:18:50,039
At a Japanese ball

380
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:51,200
I saw this person

381
00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:54,240
But what impressed me about him

382
00:18:55,079 --> 00:18:57,319
is that he's extremely cruel and bloodthirsty

383
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,880
Motegi Kazuhisa

384
00:19:03,319 --> 00:19:04,720
If you want to know the details

385
00:19:04,839 --> 00:19:05,960
you can ask Hirata

386
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,359
He's her subordinate

387
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,319
Just tell them

388
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:10,240
you're going after the Military Bureau

389
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:12,160
She'll definitely be very interested

390
00:19:16,279 --> 00:19:17,079
Brother

391
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,680
Don't be impatient

392
00:19:19,079 --> 00:19:20,319
Time will tell a horse's strength

393
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:21,920
Director

394
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,200
It's not like I'm clueless

395
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,480
With Brother Cui supporting me

396
00:19:31,799 --> 00:19:32,920
I'm quite at ease

397
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:34,519
We're like family

398
00:19:34,519 --> 00:19:35,400
No need to be so formal

399
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:37,519
Director Liang

400
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,640
Captain Yu's side is ready

401
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:39,920
The west exit is already blocked

402
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,240
Boss

403
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,440
We're ready too

404
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:44,480
We can move at any time

405
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,000
Then close the net

406
00:19:48,519 --> 00:19:49,240
I'll go too

407
00:19:49,799 --> 00:19:50,839
Why are you going?

408
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:53,039
Let the subordinates handle this kind of work

409
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,039
Brother Cui is really lucky

410
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,319
As for me

411
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:58,160
I'm just destined to worry

412
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:07,759
Boss

413
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:08,880
What should we do now?

414
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,519
With Director Liang here

415
00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:15,079
You all should learn from him

416
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,200
Is everything arranged?

417
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,039
Don't worry

418
00:20:23,079 --> 00:20:24,359
After following you for so long

419
00:20:24,359 --> 00:20:25,160
A small scene like this

420
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,599
I guarantee none of them will escape

421
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:27,960
Go

422
00:20:43,319 --> 00:20:44,039
Who are you?

423
00:20:44,039 --> 00:20:44,839
Special Operations Unit

424
00:20:44,839 --> 00:20:45,559
Routine inspection

425
00:20:45,559 --> 00:20:46,200
Don't move

426
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:32,200
Spread out and check carefully.

427
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,680
Don't miss anything.

428
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,319
Yes.

429
00:21:35,079 --> 00:21:35,759
Defan.

430
00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:36,279
Let's go.

431
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,759
This is really embarrassing for me.

432
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:47,359
Brother.

433
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,920
Your men

434
00:21:49,079 --> 00:21:50,400
are truly well-trained.

435
00:21:50,599 --> 00:21:51,519
You all saw that, right?

436
00:21:52,119 --> 00:21:53,279
That's what I call efficiency.

437
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,440
Learn from this, everyone.

438
00:21:54,599 --> 00:21:55,680
Find an opportunity

439
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,160
to let me show off too.

440
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,839
Yes.

441
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,240
He's still alive.

442
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:04,480
Carry him back.

443
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:08,920
Take him away.

444
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:09,359
Yes.

445
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:11,359
Director.

446
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,079
We found a pile of cigars here.

447
00:22:13,319 --> 00:22:14,599
They look like premium goods.

448
00:22:16,839 --> 00:22:17,680
I only want the person.

449
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I don't care about the rest.

450
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:20,039
Yes.

451
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,319
Nice stuff.

452
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:23,839
Take the items back.

453
00:23:24,119 --> 00:23:25,440
Notify the Special High Police Security Division.

454
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:26,519
Have them come to take over the scene.

455
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:27,640
Yes.

456
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:34,960
Boss.

457
00:23:35,079 --> 00:23:36,119
Is there a problem?

458
00:23:42,079 --> 00:23:43,119
Carry this person away.

459
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:43,880
Yes.

460
00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:46,319
Let me do it.

461
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,240
Let's go.

462
00:25:11,559 --> 00:25:12,359
Director

463
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:16,359
We have results.

464
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,400
He's a pushover.

465
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:18,880
He confessed as soon as he went in.

466
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:26,319
Any news about explosives left behind by Yan Jiu?

467
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,119
His rank is too low.

468
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:28,920
He doesn't have access.

469
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:29,960
But

470
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:32,160
he did reveal some important information.

471
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,440
The Bureau sent an important figure to Shanghai.

472
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,319
All resources at the Shanghai station

473
00:25:36,319 --> 00:25:37,240
are at their disposal.

474
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,400
That's a big deal.

475
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,559
Could it be that Scorpio Liang Shuo mentioned?

476
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,920
I think so too.

477
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:50,079
If that's really the case,

478
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,640
then it confirms Liang Shuo's statement.

479
00:25:55,119 --> 00:25:56,920
Organize the transcript materials.

480
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:57,720
Give them to Hirata.

481
00:25:57,799 --> 00:25:58,359
Yes.

482
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,240
Wait.

483
00:26:00,599 --> 00:26:02,200
Remind Chen Gengsheng again

484
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:04,319
that the raid on the Laobaidu warehouse

485
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,079
has already dealt a heavy blow to the Bureau.

486
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:07,720
Have the communications team

487
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:10,480
closely monitor their next move.

488
00:26:10,599 --> 00:26:11,079
Yes.

489
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:17,359
Sir

490
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,839
No. 76 sent people to take down

491
00:26:19,839 --> 00:26:21,200
one of the Shanghai station's warehouses.

492
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,279
Wang Mutian is furious.

493
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:24,839
He's upset

494
00:26:24,839 --> 00:26:26,240
about his batch of smuggled goods.

495
00:26:27,359 --> 00:26:28,359
But

496
00:26:28,359 --> 00:26:29,799
this time Fat Jin

497
00:26:29,799 --> 00:26:31,160
managed to escape unscathed.

498
00:26:34,599 --> 00:26:37,079
This is the mark he found in the warehouse.

499
00:26:37,839 --> 00:26:39,880
They say it was left by Number 76.

500
00:26:40,519 --> 00:26:42,119
This is from my Nanfeng training camp.

501
00:26:42,319 --> 00:26:44,119
It's the mark of the Flying Eagle Special Training Class.

502
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:46,079
Liang Shuo.

503
00:26:46,079 --> 00:26:48,119
He was my student back then.

504
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:49,680
Teacher.

505
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,039
You mean...

506
00:26:51,319 --> 00:26:52,680
Liang Shuo now...

507
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,880
What does this mean?

508
00:26:54,599 --> 00:26:56,160
He remembered his identity.

509
00:26:56,599 --> 00:26:58,400
If he really remembered,

510
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,200
he should have contacted our undercover agent.

511
00:27:01,359 --> 00:27:02,680
This time,

512
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,799
it seems more like a test.

513
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,359
So what should we do next?

514
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,519
Find a way to respond to him.

515
00:27:09,759 --> 00:27:10,440
Return immediately.

516
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,480
Send a classified telegram.

517
00:27:11,799 --> 00:27:14,079
Specify materials related to Mr. Yan.

518
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,160
Do not ship them out from Laobaidu.

519
00:27:16,519 --> 00:27:17,480
At 4 p.m.,

520
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,160
meet at 22 Taozhu Road.

521
00:27:19,359 --> 00:27:20,480
Then continue the discussion.

522
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,519
Remember,

523
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,720
the classification level doesn't need to be too high.

524
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,960
Will Number 76 fall for it?

525
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,599
They've always wanted to find

526
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,680
the explosives left by Yan Jiu.

527
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,039
They will definitely react.

528
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:34,720
This way, we'll have a chance to contact Liang Shuo.

529
00:27:35,519 --> 00:27:37,440
It's time for this kid

530
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,480
to think about who he really is.

531
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:51,920
Director Liang

532
00:27:52,359 --> 00:27:53,759
Look at all this stuff.

533
00:27:53,799 --> 00:27:55,680
Antiques, gold, opium, tobacco, alcohol.

534
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,119
I thought

535
00:27:56,119 --> 00:27:58,039
they would be smuggling firearms or weapons.

536
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,000
Come on, give me a break.

537
00:28:00,039 --> 00:28:02,799
Those people in Chongqing are rotten to the core.

538
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,799
Who’s still thinking about fighting a war now?

539
00:28:05,079 --> 00:28:06,000
The front lines are in trouble,

540
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,200
but the rear is just busy indulging.

541
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,039
All this stuff

542
00:28:08,079 --> 00:28:09,480
is the treasure of the officials in the rear.

543
00:28:09,599 --> 00:28:10,680
It’s even more important than weapons.

544
00:28:11,119 --> 00:28:12,319
Who would’ve thought?

545
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,119
We made our fortune thanks to the Secret Service.

546
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,759
We thought it would end up in our pockets,

547
00:28:16,839 --> 00:28:18,039
but it just goes from one hand to the other.

548
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:19,079
It all ends up in Li’s

549
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,640
superiors’ pockets.

550
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:22,880
Brother Liang,

551
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:24,559
you’ve made quite a haul.

552
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:28,799
Good stuff.

553
00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:33,160
I don't have the leisure for that.

554
00:28:36,839 --> 00:28:37,720
Thanks for your hard work.

555
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,519
Guangzhi,

556
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:42,960
Pick out some good cigarettes and liquor later.

557
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:44,759
Send them to Director Cui's office.

558
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:45,480
Yes.

559
00:28:46,319 --> 00:28:47,440
You're being so polite with me.

560
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,759
I'm just passing along someone else's gift.

561
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:49,759
We're like brothers.

562
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:50,680
No need to say that.

563
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:51,319
Right.

564
00:28:51,319 --> 00:28:52,240
We're like brothers.

565
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:52,960
Whatever you give me,

566
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:53,839
I can accept it all.

567
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:55,880
After this busy period,

568
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:56,640
go home for a bit,

569
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,519
see your sister-in-law,

570
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,680
and we'll have a meal together.

571
00:28:59,160 --> 00:28:59,640
Alright.

572
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:00,599
Boss.

573
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:06,440
Okay.

574
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:07,880
Guys,

575
00:29:08,519 --> 00:29:09,279
no need to tidy up anymore.

576
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,599
I'll take over here.

577
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,480
That's the director's instruction.

578
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,279
Tonghai,

579
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:16,359
pack these things up

580
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,519
and send them to Lianjia Alley.

581
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:18,799
Boss.

582
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:20,079
We still have to go to the dock this late?

583
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:21,160
Stop talking nonsense.

584
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:22,559
Take it.

585
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:23,319
Director Liang,

586
00:29:24,839 --> 00:29:26,039
here's the information you requested.

587
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,119
Brother Cui,

588
00:29:28,839 --> 00:29:30,039
I'll get back to work now.

589
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:31,319
About the meal,

590
00:29:31,319 --> 00:29:32,160
let's set another time.

591
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:32,799
Alright.

592
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:39,440
Hurry up.

593
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,319
Didn't they say two hunters were killed?

594
00:29:58,279 --> 00:29:59,680
The person who led the team that time

595
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,160
was named

596
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,200
Motegi Kazuhisa.

597
00:30:08,359 --> 00:30:10,200
The preliminary investigation results from the Japanese

598
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,920
say it was an encounter with the Military Commission's anti-traitor unit.

599
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
On the Manchukuo side,

600
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,799
they caught two anti-Japanese agents disguised as hunters.

601
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,039
But they refused to reveal any information.

602
00:30:18,279 --> 00:30:19,480
They have already been executed by the Japanese.

603
00:30:54,759 --> 00:30:55,319
Team Leader

604
00:30:55,759 --> 00:30:56,839
We intercepted a telegram.

605
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:02,160
Director

606
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:03,279
Please take a look.

607
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,279
According to the intelligence,

608
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,400
the Military Bureau has already found

609
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,240
the explosives left behind by Yan Jiu.

610
00:31:15,599 --> 00:31:17,440
That was fast.

611
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:18,680
Director

612
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,640
Information like this being obtained so easily

613
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:23,599
is always hard to fully trust.

614
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,400
I don't think so.

615
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:28,880
If we say

616
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,400
this is a trap,

617
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,160
it would be a bit too clumsy.

618
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:36,359
With just those few nobodies at the Shanghai station,

619
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:39,119
it's impossible for them to surround us.

620
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,559
Miss Hirata

621
00:31:41,559 --> 00:31:43,720
thinks it's worth a try.

622
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:44,839
That's right.

623
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:47,359
As long as we're fully prepared.

624
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:54,200
This No. 22 Taozhu Road

625
00:31:54,319 --> 00:31:55,160
what kind of place is it?

626
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,599
It's just an ordinary bar.

627
00:31:57,839 --> 00:31:59,160
Make the false appear real.

628
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,400
Make the real appear false.

629
00:32:00,599 --> 00:32:01,799
Then we might as well give it a try.

630
00:32:02,119 --> 00:32:03,119
It's just that

631
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:05,279
if we want to catch that secret contact,

632
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,279
we'll have to send someone

633
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:08,519
to blend into the bar.

634
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,559
Director Li already has someone in mind.

635
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:15,519
Director,

636
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:16,400
I believe

637
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,119
this is a perfect opportunity to test Director Liang.

638
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,720
If Director Liang truly has no issues,

639
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:22,559
with his skills

640
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:23,400
and his intelligence,

641
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:24,839
he should be able to succeed easily.

642
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:26,279
At that time,

643
00:32:26,279 --> 00:32:28,319
wouldn't his suspicions be cleared as well?

644
00:32:28,839 --> 00:32:29,640
Chen Gengsheng,

645
00:32:30,759 --> 00:32:32,240
why don't you mention that if something goes wrong,

646
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,000
Liang Shuo could be in danger?

647
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:35,880
I actually think

648
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,400
Group Leader Chen's suggestion

649
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:38,720
is worth considering.

650
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,119
Director, this for Liang Shuo—

651
00:32:40,119 --> 00:32:41,000
Say no more.

652
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:42,359
As long as we prepare thoroughly,

653
00:32:42,359 --> 00:32:43,559
won't that be enough?

654
00:32:44,279 --> 00:32:45,160
Director Li,

655
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,359
if necessary,

656
00:32:46,759 --> 00:32:49,599
I can request support from Mr. Mizuno.

657
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,079
Miss Hirata, since you say so,

658
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,519
I am very grateful.

659
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,000
The operation at Yulong Mountain

660
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,119
is closely related to Mr. Mizuno.

661
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,559
Now that news of the explosives has surfaced,

662
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:03,000
it should be Mr. Mizuno and us

663
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:06,079
who bring this matter to a close together.

664
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,319
Everything has been arranged.

665
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,160
You have to get involved personally.

666
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,519
Only then can you break the deadlock.

667
00:33:44,079 --> 00:33:45,960
The inside of this bar isn't very big.

668
00:33:46,319 --> 00:33:48,039
If we bring too many people,

669
00:33:48,119 --> 00:33:49,319
it will attract attention.

670
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:51,440
We should send someone to scout first.

671
00:33:53,359 --> 00:33:54,359
As for the specific operation,

672
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,519
the director has already explained it to me in detail.

673
00:33:57,039 --> 00:33:58,319
I, Liang, will take the lead.

674
00:33:58,319 --> 00:33:59,519
It's my duty.

675
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:00,839
But

676
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:02,319
to be honest,

677
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,240
I'm not completely confident.

678
00:34:06,279 --> 00:34:08,320
I'd like to borrow someone from Chief Hirata.

679
00:34:08,599 --> 00:34:09,559
to accompany me.

680
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:11,159
That way, the chances

681
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:12,800
might be a bit better.

682
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,199
Of course.

683
00:34:15,039 --> 00:34:17,519
I wonder who Director Liang has in mind.

684
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,840
Feel free to choose.

685
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:37,880
Him.

686
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:41,039
Motegi.

687
00:34:44,559 --> 00:34:45,400
Chief.

688
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,679
It's an honor to be chosen by Director Liang.

689
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,000
Yes.

690
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:56,840
Now,

691
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:58,840
there are fifteen minutes left

692
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,599
until the meeting with the Chongqing agents.

693
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,000
Inside the bar,

694
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,599
I've also arranged personnel.

695
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:04,880
Next,

696
00:35:05,079 --> 00:35:06,639
it's up to Director Liang.

697
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,119
Alright.

698
00:35:08,679 --> 00:35:10,000
Let's go get ready.

699
00:35:19,199 --> 00:35:20,119
Chief

700
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:23,719
When I was transferred to Shanghai last year,

701
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,599
on Xinluo Street,

702
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:27,239
during an operation to eliminate Central Bureau agents,

703
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,039
I met Director Liang once.

704
00:35:29,039 --> 00:35:31,599
Chief Mizuno also appreciates his working style.

705
00:35:32,159 --> 00:35:33,079
That operation

706
00:35:33,079 --> 00:35:34,840
I have heard a little about it as well.

707
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:37,440
It was indeed impressive.

708
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:40,800
He is a rare talent in the current Special Operations Headquarters.

709
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:43,599
Although we value him,

710
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:46,639
the matter at Yulong Mountain is still unclear.

711
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:49,280
If he can clear himself of this suspicion,

712
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,599
I would be happy to make friends with him.

713
00:35:50,599 --> 00:35:52,320
as a friend.

714
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,400
Gentlemen, what would you like to drink?

715
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:08,440
Daiquiri.

716
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,519
This gentleman will have the same as me.

717
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,199
Alright, please wait a moment.

718
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,119
Captain Motegi, there's no need to be so nervous.

719
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,639
This is just a small task.

720
00:37:32,039 --> 00:37:33,280
Your expression

721
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,039
makes it easy for the enemy to notice.

722
00:37:39,719 --> 00:37:41,079
I'm going to the restroom.

723
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,800
Do you need to watch me even when I use the bathroom?

724
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:35,880
Please enjoy your meal.

725
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:42,239
Captain Kazuhisa Motegi.

726
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,920
Here's to a successful collaboration today.

727
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:46,199
Mr. Liang.

728
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:48,800
When I'm on a mission,

729
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,639
I never drink alcohol.

730
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,079
If I don't drink today,

731
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:57,440
I'm afraid there won't be another chance.

732
00:40:10,519 --> 00:40:11,840
The Military Bureau has finally

733
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,679
lost their patience and made a move.

734
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:15,599
When should we take action?

735
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:16,960
Don't rush.

736
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:20,159
Keep a close watch on the bar.

737
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,280
If you kill him, you'll look even more suspicious.

738
00:40:25,639 --> 00:40:26,960
I have my own way.

739
00:40:27,039 --> 00:40:28,480
If you want to see Scorpio, come with us.

740
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:32,280
If you want me to go, bring the Japanese with you.

741
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:55,000
The Military Bureau's people have all slipped away.

742
00:40:55,159 --> 00:40:58,519
We found a secret passage in the bar's kitchen.

743
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:04,320
Sir.

744
00:41:04,559 --> 00:41:05,639
Our agent on Dafei Road

745
00:41:05,639 --> 00:41:06,920
spotted a suspicious vehicle.

746
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:07,719
It looked like Director Liang

747
00:41:07,719 --> 00:41:10,199
and Captain Motegi were taken away.

748
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:13,800
Send someone to follow them immediately.

749
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:16,440
I want to catch them all in one go.

750
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:17,440
Yes, sir.

751
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,039
Let's go.

752
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:19,840
Long time no see.
