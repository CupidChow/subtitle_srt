1
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:47,760
Although No. 76 appears to be a puppet on the surface,

2
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,799
no one is truly willing to be a subordinate.

3
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:52,040
Especially someone like Wang Jingwei.

4
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,280
As long as you grasp their master's intentions,

5
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:55,640
it's not hard to figure out

6
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,519
what moves their subordinates will make.

7
00:01:58,599 --> 00:01:59,680
What about Sister Man?

8
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,280
How is she doing now?

9
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:03,400
Not very well.

10
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,840
I don't know how much longer she can hold on.

11
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:07,439
I'll make sure Li Hanzhi

12
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,039
and Mizuno Nobukage are convinced

13
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,719
that Fei Man

14
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:12,360
really has the list in her hands.

15
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,080
All we can do is gamble

16
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:17,000
on how much Li Hanzhi values this information.

17
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,159
Time to eat.

18
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,520
Understood.

19
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,520
Alright, coming.

20
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:23,280
Remember,

21
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:24,800
go to the Siping Grain Store

22
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,319
and buy a bowl of Taihu rice.

23
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,479
Just one bowl.

24
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:29,919
Then quickly pass the information to Old Tan.

25
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,479
Got it.

26
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:33,159
Hurry up and eat.

27
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,199
Time to eat.

28
00:02:35,719 --> 00:02:36,560
Liang Shuo.

29
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,759
We finally caught them when they're free.

30
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,879
Today is our opening meal.

31
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:41,879
Opening meal?

32
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:43,919
Of course, we have to eat it together.

33
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:44,759
Liang Shuo.

34
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,280
I'm here.

35
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,280
Did you tell him?

36
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:47,560
Not yet.

37
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:49,120
You two,

38
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:50,560
what are you whispering about?

39
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,520
It's just a secret between sisters.

40
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,719
It has nothing to do with you.

41
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,000
So this has something to do with me, right?

42
00:02:58,199 --> 00:02:59,199
Just these two dishes?

43
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,479
You’re sending us off with just that?

44
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:02,560
It’s been so busy these days.

45
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,599
Who has the time to make so many dishes for you?

46
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:06,919
I’m just one person with two hands.

47
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,159
I’m not Sun Wukong with three heads and six arms.

48
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:10,120
Exactly.

49
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,599
You’re so picky.

50
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:13,840
Then go eat at the headquarters’ cafeteria.

51
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,800
You’ve already joined forces in such a short time.

52
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,400
Liang Shuo, you’re not helping me.

53
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,039
You’re just realizing that today?

54
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:23,240
Here.

55
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:27,719
Hello?

56
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,439
Sir.

57
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,639
It seems like it’s your call.

58
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:31,599
It’s work-related.

59
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:32,240
Okay.

60
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:33,439
Can you hurry up?

61
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:34,039
Okay.

62
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:37,280
Go ahead.

63
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,159
Is it good?

64
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:39,280
Of course it’s good.

65
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:43,560
When they were arresting the suspect,

66
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,000
hadn't the military police already withdrawn?

67
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,319
How did they know about it?

68
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:47,639
I don't know either.

69
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,039
Chief Gao Mu

70
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:49,759
seems to know.

71
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:51,879
It was our intelligence department interrogating the suspect.

72
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,439
They called us to ask for the person.

73
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:54,240
Boss,

74
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,360
how should we respond?

75
00:03:55,719 --> 00:03:56,800
How to respond?

76
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,360
Stall them for now.

77
00:03:58,639 --> 00:03:59,560
Does the director know?

78
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:01,960
The people from the interrogation room have already informed him.

79
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,719
Director Li has already returned to headquarters.

80
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,919
Why didn't you say so earlier?

81
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:08,080
I couldn't find you.

82
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:09,120
As for this call,

83
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,080
I had to get it from the general affairs office.

84
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:11,719
Alright.

85
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:12,879
You wait there.

86
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,199
I'm heading back to headquarters now.

87
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:17,839
Hurry up.

88
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:18,839
We're just waiting for you.

89
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:21,959
There's something at headquarters.

90
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:22,879
I have to go back.

91
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,639
So you're not eating?

92
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,399
What's going on?

93
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:27,839
Meihua Hall wants someone.

94
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:28,959
The director takes it very seriously.

95
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:30,040
He's already gone back.

96
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:31,560
What do you think?

97
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,319
Then I'll go back with you.

98
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:35,920
Alright.

99
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,480
You guys eat.

100
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,199
No need to wait.

101
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,439
They have their own things to do.

102
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:43,519
Let's just eat.

103
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:50,279
Sister-in-law

104
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:51,439
Don't be upset.

105
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,319
You'll get a chance to talk about it eventually.

106
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,879
You really shouldn't be unhappy.

107
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:56,240
You're still carrying a child.

108
00:04:57,439 --> 00:04:59,240
Eat, have some more.

109
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:01,000
Go on, eat.

110
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:12,560
Open the door.

111
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:15,199
Director.

112
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:16,319
Where's the chief?

113
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:17,759
Inside.

114
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:18,720
The interrogation has already started.

115
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:20,279
The chief had just arrived not long ago.

116
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:21,600
That female communist confessed.

117
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:22,600
She confessed.

118
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,079
When I interrogated her this morning,

119
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,439
she would rather die than give in.

120
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,600
How did she confess?

121
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,079
With our department's torture methods.

122
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:32,680
How many people could endure that?

123
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,079
But to be fair,

124
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:35,959
that female communist is really impressive.

125
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,439
She looks delicate,

126
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:37,920
look at this—

127
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,759
except for her face,

128
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:40,319
there's not a single patch of uninjured skin on her body.

129
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:41,319
She still refused to talk.

130
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:42,319
Enough nonsense.

131
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:43,519
Get to the point.

132
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:44,439
Well,

133
00:05:44,439 --> 00:05:46,040
our chief had a trick up his sleeve.

134
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,800
He threatened to brand her face with a hot iron.

135
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:49,120
What pretty girl

136
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,439
could stand that?

137
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:52,399
All the information on Jiang Feiman—

138
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:53,480
has it all been confirmed?

139
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,800
The chief is still interrogating her.

140
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,879
We don't know either.

141
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,399
Brother,

142
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:00,399
go in and take a look.

143
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:03,759
Open the door.

144
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,000
The operation plan and personnel you mentioned

145
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:18,680
are not what I care about.

146
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:20,959
If I wanted to know these things,

147
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:23,560
I could easily get them from Meihua Hall.

148
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,399
It seems

149
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,600
you're still not being honest.

150
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,800
You need to understand one thing.

151
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:32,000
If you don't give me

152
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,519
the information I want,

153
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,160
it's the same as saying nothing.

154
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,639
I've told you

155
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,000
everything I can.

156
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:42,240
What else do you want to know?

157
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:43,600
When did you

158
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:45,480
find out about Kazuo Nakayama?

159
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:49,199
Four days ago.

160
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,920
Why are you monitoring him?

161
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:54,000
What do you mean, why?

162
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:58,639
From what I know about your party,

163
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,199
your operations are always very meticulous.

164
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,680
Such a hasty action

165
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:05,319
is really rare.

166
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:06,759
Tell me.

167
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:08,160
Your intelligence

168
00:07:08,439 --> 00:07:09,920
where exactly did it come from?

169
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,240
I'm just the one carrying out the mission.

170
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,199
As for the source of the information,

171
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:18,120
I...

172
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:20,079
I really don't know.

173
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:22,879
All I know is

174
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,160
Kazuo Nakayama

175
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,879
has knowledge of a piece of confidential information.

176
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:31,920
From what the higher-ups said,

177
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:33,480
they want to use him

178
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,800
Found the intelligence.

179
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,279
What kind of intelligence is it?

180
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,600
A list.

181
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:46,680
Okay.

182
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:48,720
Very good.

183
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,000
If you want to stay alive,

184
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,720
then tell the truth.

185
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,800
Recorder.

186
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,600
You should understand that the Special Affairs Committee

187
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,360
takes this matter very seriously.

188
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,600
You have time to celebrate your family's business opening,

189
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:22,319
but not enough to focus on the interrogation.

190
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:23,959
That was my negligence.

191
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,399
I will definitely learn from this.

192
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,439
Director.

193
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,680
As for Meihua Hall,

194
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,839
what does it have to do with you?

195
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,720
If they want someone, that's their business.

196
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,000
Whether to release them or not is my business.

197
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:36,039
In the end,

198
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:37,039
it still depends on

199
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,720
whether we can get

200
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,240
valuable intelligence from this Communist.

201
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,000
Yes.

202
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,519
Handle the rest properly.

203
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:45,840
Whether this interrogation yields results

204
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:47,440
depends entirely on you.

205
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,120
Rest assured.

206
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,120
I'll take care of it right away.

207
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,159
Take care.

208
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,360
Alright, thank you.

209
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:23,120
Miss,

210
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,360
are you here to buy rice?

211
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,759
We just got a new shipment of Jiaxing rice.

212
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:27,639
It's fragrant and sticky.

213
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:29,039
Would you like to buy some to take home?

214
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:31,240
Do you have Taihu rice?

215
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:34,440
We do,

216
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,320
but it's last year's old stock.

217
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:37,559
We don't have any new arrivals.

218
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,759
The price

219
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:39,759
isn't very good either.

220
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:41,799
I'll buy a bowl.

221
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:43,759
Alright.

222
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:44,519
Please wait a moment.

223
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:54,559
Mr. Tan,

224
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:55,799
there's a young lady downstairs looking for you.

225
00:09:56,519 --> 00:09:57,840
She used our code.

226
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:00,600
Let her in quickly.

227
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,519
Okay.

228
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,480
I finally get to see you.

229
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:14,840
Miss Xie.

230
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:15,480
Yes.

231
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,720
How did you know about this place?

232
00:10:18,679 --> 00:10:19,879
Sister Feiman was arrested.

233
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,919
Liang Shuo told me to come find you.

234
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:24,360
Liang Shuo?

235
00:10:24,919 --> 00:10:26,120
What else did he say?

236
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,240
He said

237
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,080
he'll find a way to rescue Sister Feiman,

238
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:33,799
but he needs your cooperation.

239
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,960
Intelligence from the Communists indicates

240
00:10:39,159 --> 00:10:41,200
that the information used to destroy the Military Statistics Bureau's Shanghai station

241
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,000
did indeed come from the Japanese, Asai Hisashi.

242
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,399
It was a list he compiled.

243
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,000
Everyone is on high alert.

244
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,320
But we are more than a step behind others.

245
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,000
If we don't act quickly,

246
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:53,879
how can we possibly gain the upper hand?

247
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:54,960
You're absolutely right.

248
00:10:55,799 --> 00:10:56,720
In that case,

249
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,120
the reason they attacked Nakayama Kazuo

250
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,600
is quite obvious.

251
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,639
That's correct.

252
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,039
I just don't understand

253
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:05,440
how the Communists got this information.

254
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:08,600
The Communists have always had a complex network of sources.

255
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:10,679
They set up their pieces well, even the seemingly insignificant ones.

256
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,759
It's not surprising they got the intel first.

257
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:14,799
I'm not surprised at all.

258
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,679
None of that matters.

259
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
What matters is

260
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,759
not to mention the Chongqing side,

261
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,679
but given the current situation,

262
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:23,519
the Communists

263
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,360
are also after this information.

264
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:27,960
Yet we, as the main party involved,

265
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:29,960
are always a step behind.

266
00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:34,720
This list was made more than a decade ago.

267
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:35,840
Back then,

268
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,879
Chairman Wang and the key members of the new government

269
00:11:37,879 --> 00:11:38,960
were in a very different place.

270
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:40,960
I'm sure I don't need to spell it out.

271
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:44,519
As for Asai Hisashi,

272
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:47,480
he is far-sighted and resolute.

273
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:50,519
Truly a legend in the intelligence world.

274
00:11:54,679 --> 00:11:55,720
You mean

275
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:57,120
on this list

276
00:11:57,639 --> 00:11:59,399
there must be people from our Nanjing government.

277
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:02,960
We can't afford to take even the slightest risk with this.

278
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,960
Whether or not there are people from the new government on the list,

279
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:09,039
we have to get involved.

280
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:11,320
The current situation is

281
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,559
the Special Affairs Committee already knows.

282
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,840
We need to prepare in advance.

283
00:12:16,679 --> 00:12:18,519
If, on the day of the Peace Conference,

284
00:12:19,559 --> 00:12:22,200
the Japanese use this list to threaten us,

285
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,480
then what do you expect Chairman Wang and the new government

286
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,080
to do in such a passive situation?

287
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,279
How could we even talk about "co-prosperity" then?

288
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:30,960
I didn't expect that behind all this

289
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,480
there would be such a scheme.

290
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:34,279
They really have it all planned out.

291
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,200
Director,

292
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:37,480
we can't just let ourselves be at their mercy.

293
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:38,320
Not necessarily.

294
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:40,080
Let's think about this differently.

295
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:42,879
If we get this list before the Peace Conference,

296
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,120
if we obtain the list,

297
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:48,000
what leverage would they have left

298
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,320
to negotiate with us?

299
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,759
In that case,

300
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:53,360
we could turn the tables and take the initiative.

301
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:56,000
We could even use it to threaten Chongqing.

302
00:12:57,879 --> 00:12:59,440
Saving the country by indirect means

303
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,320
is definitely not just empty talk.

304
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:01,960
Yes.

305
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:05,440
This mess between us and the Japanese

306
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,559
should be sorted out now.

307
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,279
But we received a message from Meihua Hall

308
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:15,360
asking us to transfer the prisoner over.

309
00:13:16,039 --> 00:13:17,679
This is already the third time.

310
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:20,039
As for Jiang Feiman,

311
00:13:20,039 --> 00:13:22,440
Nanjing is also waiting for our update.

312
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,919
This person cannot be sent to Meihua Hall.

313
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,799
The Nanjing side is closely monitoring this matter.

314
00:13:29,159 --> 00:13:31,960
Jiang Feiman himself is the best evidence.

315
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:34,039
This Jiang Feiman

316
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,440
is indeed the one we need.

317
00:13:36,759 --> 00:13:38,200
So what should we do now?

318
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:41,000
We can't just outright refuse the Japanese, can we?

319
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:45,120
Of course we can't openly refuse the Japanese.

320
00:13:45,799 --> 00:13:47,039
Tell Mizuno

321
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,960
that we will follow the procedure

322
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,759
and hand this person over to them.

323
00:13:50,919 --> 00:13:53,000
But it must be signed by me personally.

324
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:54,960
This afternoon,

325
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,480
I will leave the Special Agent Headquarters.

326
00:13:56,799 --> 00:13:57,960
As for Jiang Feiman,

327
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,279
try to delay it as much as possible.

328
00:13:59,279 --> 00:13:59,759
Yes.

329
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,440
We can also take this opportunity

330
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,519
to sound out the Japanese.

331
00:14:06,919 --> 00:14:07,720
Secondly,

332
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,120
we must find a suitable candidate

333
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,759
to escort Jiang Feiman to Nanjing.

334
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:15,840
Director,

335
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,879
I actually have someone in mind.

336
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:24,240
The Communist Party has always been well-trained.

337
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,559
Judging from this incident,

338
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,360
it seems they were careless.

339
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,120
Maybe,

340
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,559
this is actually a trap.

341
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,600
I agree with the chief's opinion.

342
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,200
How interesting.

343
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,759
The Chongqing agents in the Asai residence

344
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:46,600
haven't been exposed yet.

345
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,440
Now the Yan'an agents have appeared again.

346
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:51,000
This leaker

347
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,799
and the one hiding in the Asai residence

348
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:56,080
could be the same person.

349
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,120
That's possible, isn't it?

350
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:03,519
If you could

351
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,200
learn about their history beforehand,

352
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:07,080
then you would realize

353
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,639
that cooperation between the Communist Party and the Nationalist Party

354
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:11,159
is nearly impossible.

355
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:15,000
That's true.

356
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:18,679
About that Communist suspect,

357
00:15:18,679 --> 00:15:19,840
what's the situation?

358
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,039
I've made three requests to No. 76

359
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:26,879
to interrogate the prisoner.

360
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:28,799
But I haven't received any response at all.

361
00:15:29,559 --> 00:15:30,840
Go to the secret service headquarters yourself

362
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:31,720
and find out what's going on.

363
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,399
Yes.

364
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,120
What is it?

365
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,279
Still no word from Chongqing?

366
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,600
Something like this happened in Shanghai,

367
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,879
you have to give the higher-ups

368
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,799
some time to respond and handle it.

369
00:15:43,799 --> 00:15:44,600
Time?

370
00:15:44,919 --> 00:15:46,879
Do they even understand what that word means?

371
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,639
I give them time,

372
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:49,679
but who gives me time?

373
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:50,440
Lao Wu,

374
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,679
in our current situation,

375
00:15:53,159 --> 00:15:55,159
what do we have to fight the Japanese with?

376
00:15:55,639 --> 00:15:57,399
No people, no guns.

377
00:15:57,559 --> 00:15:58,440
All we can do is wait.

378
00:15:58,559 --> 00:15:59,679
We have no other choice.

379
00:16:01,159 --> 00:16:02,200
Besides,

380
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,240
since you chose Liang Shuo,

381
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,039
you should trust him.

382
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:07,960
After all,

383
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,879
he's a student you trained.

384
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,799
I would never tie my own fate

385
00:16:13,799 --> 00:16:15,000
to someone else.

386
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:17,600
No one.

387
00:16:17,879 --> 00:16:19,840
After so much betrayal and rebellion,

388
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:22,200
don't you understand that by now?

389
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:23,399
What?

390
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:24,639
You suspect him?

391
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,879
Trust, for an agent,

392
00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:31,840
is the most dangerous thing.

393
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:34,080
Even if I don't suspect him,

394
00:16:35,879 --> 00:16:37,559
I still won't put all my eggs in one basket.

395
00:16:37,559 --> 00:16:38,559
So what do you want to do?

396
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,679
I'll handle it myself.

397
00:16:41,879 --> 00:16:42,879
Handle it yourself?

398
00:16:43,399 --> 00:16:44,200
What do you mean?

399
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:48,840
Years ago, the Second Division of the Military Bureau

400
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,320
ran a training program in Caojing.

401
00:16:52,039 --> 00:16:53,360
I think you were in charge of it, right?

402
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,000
Yes.

403
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,039
That's right.

404
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,559
The training program wasn't very large.

405
00:16:57,679 --> 00:16:59,440
But the training content was formal.

406
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,600
Several senior members of Lixing Society

407
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,679
attended the classes.

408
00:17:03,159 --> 00:17:04,240
But this training program

409
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:06,960
was shut down long ago due to funding issues.

410
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,839
And those who joined the program back then

411
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,680
were just kids, around ten years old.

412
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,720
Our intention was to select some promising youngsters.

413
00:17:15,559 --> 00:17:17,559
But later, for special reasons,

414
00:17:18,039 --> 00:17:20,559
our superiors told us to send them home.

415
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,519
They were all just kids.

416
00:17:22,519 --> 00:17:23,599
What use could they be?

417
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,440
They were kids back then,

418
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,359
but they're not anymore.

419
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:32,559
Lao Wu,

420
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:34,599
stop overthinking this.

421
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,640
This matter

422
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,599
is absolutely out of the question.

423
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,440
Let me ask you,

424
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,599
do you think the Japanese will see them as just kids

425
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,720
and show any mercy?

426
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,160
I must have these people.

427
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,839
But so many years have passed.

428
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:50,960
You want me

429
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,440
to find them, but where am I supposed to look?

430
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:54,599
I believe others can't find them.

431
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:56,400
But you, Old Seven,

432
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,720
always have a way.

433
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,480
Ten.

434
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,720
I only need ten.

435
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:01,880
Ten?

436
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:03,599
Impossible.

437
00:18:04,039 --> 00:18:05,400
So many years have passed.

438
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:06,440
Among these people,

439
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,960
who can be trusted and who can't

440
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,519
can no longer be verified.

441
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:10,240
Besides,

442
00:18:10,519 --> 00:18:11,839
to gather these people,

443
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,240
we must get the student records from back then.

444
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,799
But the school

445
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,519
has already been occupied by the Japanese.

446
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:18,960
None of these are problems.

447
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:22,079
I can have Scholar handle it.

448
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,440
Walk faster.

449
00:18:34,359 --> 00:18:35,200
Open the door.

450
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:39,839
Let's go.

451
00:18:48,039 --> 00:18:50,200
You understand the specific task now, right?

452
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,119
Set out early tomorrow morning.

453
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,720
You'll be taking the railway.

454
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:54,799
The journey isn't far.

455
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,119
But especially during this time,

456
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,799
you must be extra careful.

457
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,480
Yes.

458
00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:02,119
Please wait for good news, Director.

459
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,279
What are we eating later?

460
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,119
I want to have some fish.

461
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,279
Do we have any?

462
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,559
We'll know once we check.

463
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:16,720
Alright.

464
00:19:46,839 --> 00:19:47,599
What's wrong? Let's go.

465
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:48,960
The door doesn't seem to be closed properly.

466
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,240
You go ahead.

467
00:20:16,279 --> 00:20:17,079
Director Liang.

468
00:20:17,559 --> 00:20:19,279
Secretary Wang is urging about the handover report.

469
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,759
Let me ask one more thing.

470
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,200
Is it really that urgent?

471
00:20:22,519 --> 00:20:24,599
We still don't know about this escort, Feng Shensuan.

472
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:26,799
He's so loose-tongued.

473
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,880
Is this how Old Li trained you all?

474
00:20:30,279 --> 00:20:32,039
What if others hear about this?

475
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:33,559
Can you bear the consequences?

476
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,759
Don't try to figure things out on your own from now on.

477
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:37,119
Go check with Secretary Wang.

478
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:37,920
Did you hear me?

479
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:38,640
Yes.

480
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,519
I advise you not to have any inappropriate thoughts.

481
00:20:58,759 --> 00:21:00,680
If you reveal your identity to save her,

482
00:21:01,119 --> 00:21:02,720
you know what the consequences will be.

483
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,319
You can rest assured.

484
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,319
But what about you?

485
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:09,640
Did you find out anything at Plum Blossom Hall?

486
00:21:12,519 --> 00:21:15,119
Mizuno is very wary about the information being leaked to Li Hanzhi.

487
00:21:15,119 --> 00:21:16,119
He is very cautious.

488
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,000
I just realized it now.

489
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:22,119
You used me to gather information from Mizuno.

490
00:21:22,519 --> 00:21:25,000
You wanted Mizuno and Li Hanzhi to fight each other.

491
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,720
So you could win more time for Jiang Feiman.

492
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,759
Give her a better chance to survive.

493
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,960
Director Lu, your imagination

494
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,480
is truly impressive.

495
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,880
Let me give you some information you might find interesting.

496
00:21:41,279 --> 00:21:42,519
Tomorrow at 6 a.m.,

497
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,880
the Special Committee will use a special train

498
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,119
to transfer Jiang Feiman to Nanjing.

499
00:21:46,759 --> 00:21:48,200
Feng Shen will be escorting her.

500
00:21:52,119 --> 00:21:53,319
Sometimes,

501
00:21:53,839 --> 00:21:55,920
you and Scorpio are really alike.

502
00:21:56,079 --> 00:21:57,920
So arrogant that it's annoying.

503
00:21:58,319 --> 00:21:59,519
You think

504
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,240
either I will go to rescue her,

505
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,559
or

506
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:04,440
if the Communists go to rescue her,

507
00:22:04,599 --> 00:22:06,759
then it must be because I leaked the information.

508
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,079
No matter which it is,

509
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,319
in any case,

510
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:13,039
I can't escape being connected to the Communists.

511
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,759
As long as you know.

512
00:22:54,839 --> 00:22:55,839
I want to know

513
00:22:56,039 --> 00:22:57,279
what the reason is

514
00:22:57,599 --> 00:22:58,960
that even the transfer of an ordinary prisoner

515
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,640
is being delayed and obstructed

516
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:01,680
Mr. Takagi

517
00:23:02,039 --> 00:23:03,759
you are Director Mizuno's man

518
00:23:03,759 --> 00:23:05,039
even if I had more courage

519
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:06,839
I wouldn't dare delay things for you

520
00:23:06,839 --> 00:23:07,599
Very good

521
00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:08,799
Since you wouldn't dare

522
00:23:08,839 --> 00:23:10,119
then take me to get the prisoner

523
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,200
No need to rush

524
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:12,160
Please have a seat first

525
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,160
Let's have something to drink

526
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:13,880
and talk for a bit

527
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,599
Mr. Takagi

528
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,640
It's not that I'm unwilling to cooperate with you

529
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,599
We also have our own rules and regulations

530
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,079
When it comes to transferring prisoners

531
00:23:21,079 --> 00:23:21,920
the new government

532
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,759
has given us clear instructions

533
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:25,720
Here, I

534
00:23:27,119 --> 00:23:27,920
Qi Xiuquan

535
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:28,680
come here

536
00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:30,160
the document issued from above

537
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,119
where did you put it for me

538
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:32,640
Director

539
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,799
didn't you put it in your own drawer

540
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:35,920
Did I?

541
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,559
Yes

542
00:23:36,839 --> 00:23:37,640
Please wait a moment

543
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,400
It's really here

544
00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:42,519
Take a look

545
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:43,359
You may go

546
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:44,000
Yes

547
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,799
It's clearly written here

548
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,519
that at least one of the two directors at headquarters must sign

549
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:50,599
before we can release the prisoner

550
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,720
There’s something you don’t know.

551
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,759
Our director,

552
00:23:56,759 --> 00:23:58,200
is currently on a business trip in Nanjing.

553
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,000
I don’t know when he’ll be back.

554
00:24:02,319 --> 00:24:03,680
After all this talk,

555
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,640
are you playing games with me?

556
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,920
I’m just a minor section chief.

557
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,759
The director gave strict orders.

558
00:24:09,079 --> 00:24:10,319
If he blames me for this,

559
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,880
I can’t take that responsibility.

560
00:24:12,519 --> 00:24:14,759
Then can you handle Mr. Mizuno’s reproach?

561
00:24:16,039 --> 00:24:16,960
Mr. Takagi,

562
00:24:17,359 --> 00:24:18,759
we’ve been friends for a long time.

563
00:24:18,759 --> 00:24:20,440
Please show me some mercy.

564
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,240
Give me just one more day.

565
00:24:22,599 --> 00:24:23,839
As soon as the director returns,

566
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:26,319
I’ll personally deliver the criminal to you at Meihua Hall.

567
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:27,440
How about that?

568
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,480
So you're saying

569
00:24:33,799 --> 00:24:34,839
that today, Director Cui

570
00:24:34,839 --> 00:24:36,799
absolutely refuses to compromise.

571
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:38,759
There's really nothing we can do.

572
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:42,759
Alright.

573
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:45,319
Mr. Takagi,

574
00:24:46,279 --> 00:24:47,200
Mr. Takagi,

575
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:48,680
Mizuno,

576
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,200
your vision is still too short-sighted.

577
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,480
I originally thought

578
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:56,279
your ambition would broaden your perspective.

579
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,000
What a pity.

580
00:24:58,839 --> 00:25:00,720
You've really disappointed me.

581
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:03,599
The March 1st list—

582
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,799
you obtained it far too easily.

583
00:25:06,119 --> 00:25:08,279
It made you mistakenly believe that success was within easy reach.

584
00:25:08,599 --> 00:25:11,960
It also made you underestimate your opponents.

585
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,519
Even worse, you can't even tell

586
00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:15,519
who your real enemy is.

587
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:19,960
Senior Asai, are you saying

588
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:22,839
we don't need to pay attention to the Nanjing government?

589
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,279
You must always understand

590
00:25:24,279 --> 00:25:25,400
that the Nanjing government

591
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,240
is nothing more than a troublemaker.

592
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,440
They are by no means the enemy.

593
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,519
Our real enemies

594
00:25:30,519 --> 00:25:32,519
are those who are secretly watching you.

595
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:37,279
The Shanghai station

596
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,400
has already been eliminated by me.

597
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,880
But the infiltrator still hasn't been caught, right?

598
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,839
In my opinion,

599
00:25:45,839 --> 00:25:47,920
the intelligence obtained by the Nanjing government

600
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,559
—all those reports—

601
00:25:50,119 --> 00:25:51,440
were all used by the infiltrator

602
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:57,200
as tools to drive a wedge between you and Nanjing.

603
00:25:58,119 --> 00:25:59,519
These processed pieces of intelligence

604
00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:01,400
how could they so accurately

605
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,559
end up on both your desks at the same time?

606
00:26:05,079 --> 00:26:08,400
There's no such coincidence in this world.

607
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,559
I understand.

608
00:26:13,559 --> 00:26:15,279
The rapid turn of events

609
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,920
has exceeded our expectations.

610
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,200
Is the rescue operation certain?

611
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,480
Tomorrow morning at six o'clock,

612
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:21,079
Li Hanzhi will escort Jiang Feiman

613
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:22,559
to Nanjing by special train.

614
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:23,839
Now that we have the exact time

615
00:26:23,839 --> 00:26:25,400
and the transport route, things will be easier.

616
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,160
Notify our comrades in Jiangsu

617
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:29,279
to coordinate the rescue along the railway.

618
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:29,920
Understood.

619
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,119
I suggest our people

620
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,519
board the train at Suzhou Station.

621
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,680
Because there are a lot of people there,

622
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,440
but the surveillance isn't as strict.

623
00:26:38,319 --> 00:26:39,880
What about Mizuno Nobukage's side?

624
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,240
No reaction at all?

625
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,720
Not for now.

626
00:26:43,359 --> 00:26:44,359
But the intelligence headquarters

627
00:26:44,359 --> 00:26:46,359
has become suspicious about the 31-list leak.

628
00:26:48,519 --> 00:26:49,720
That's an unpredictable factor.

629
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:51,440
We have to be cautious.

630
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,759
You leaked the escort information.

631
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,920
Do you have a backup plan in case headquarters investigates thoroughly?

632
00:26:58,839 --> 00:27:00,200
Section Chief Li from the Secretariat

633
00:27:00,359 --> 00:27:01,720
is closely connected to Feng Shen.

634
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,759
As for who made the mistake,

635
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:05,920
let Li Hanzhi figure it out himself.

636
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,920
If there's an emergency in the future,

637
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,720
Miss Xie can be sent to deliver messages.

638
00:27:14,759 --> 00:27:16,039
The organization has already agreed

639
00:27:16,319 --> 00:27:17,559
to recruit Miss Xie

640
00:27:17,559 --> 00:27:18,920
as an external member of the party.

641
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,799
The evaluation of her

642
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,680
has officially begun as well.

643
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:24,440
Alright.

644
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,839
I will pass this on to her.

645
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:28,400
Let's discuss together

646
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,920
tomorrow's rescue operation.

647
00:27:32,119 --> 00:27:34,319
Several search operations

648
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:35,400
have failed to find

649
00:27:35,799 --> 00:27:37,440
any trace of that infiltrator.

650
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:40,200
I think you should be even more

651
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,960
concerned about this than I am.

652
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:46,680
Until you have eliminated all the enemies,

653
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,960
you must not let your guard down.

654
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,599
That's my advice to you.

655
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,839
With your words, Senior Asai,

656
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:56,720
I feel much more at ease.

657
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,319
Our cooperation

658
00:27:59,319 --> 00:28:02,799
will not be affected in the slightest by the Nanjing government.

659
00:28:03,359 --> 00:28:04,920
Great minds think alike.

660
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:05,839
Someone, come.

661
00:28:10,839 --> 00:28:12,440
Mr. Asai is tired.

662
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,039
Please escort our distinguished guest to rest.

663
00:28:15,799 --> 00:28:16,559
After you, Senior.

664
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:31,680
Director

665
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,359
I'm already aware of that matter.

666
00:28:34,359 --> 00:28:35,599
The issue with No. 76.

667
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:36,720
Let them handle it themselves.

668
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,680
We won't get involved.

669
00:28:39,079 --> 00:28:40,480
Let's just leave it at that.

670
00:28:42,119 --> 00:28:45,440
Don't let the Nanjing government disrupt our rhythm.

671
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,200
Right at this particular moment.

672
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,359
Don't you think there's something wrong?

673
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,680
What if it's related to the infiltrators?

674
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:54,200
They want to know the whereabouts of the list.

675
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,640
Something just feels off to me.

676
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,200
If I'm not mistaken,

677
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,880
this must be a trap.

678
00:29:01,599 --> 00:29:03,160
Director, what should I do?

679
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:05,920
The most important thing

680
00:29:06,319 --> 00:29:08,880
is to ignore the Nanjing side.

681
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,640
Our target is the infiltrator.

682
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:14,519
Go to Nanjing and take the opportunity

683
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:18,200
to bring Jiang Feiman back to me.

684
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,200
Do you understand?

685
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,400
What did Nanjing say in response?

686
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,359
They told us to send the prisoner over as soon as possible.

687
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:28,519
We shouldn't make any big moves.

688
00:29:28,599 --> 00:29:30,279
Don't let the Japanese notice.

689
00:29:30,599 --> 00:29:31,400
The Japanese...

690
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,720
They've already noticed.

691
00:29:32,839 --> 00:29:34,480
They just haven't said anything.

692
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,279
Takagi has come several times before to ask for people.

693
00:29:37,839 --> 00:29:39,559
Now, all of a sudden, it's gone quiet.

694
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,519
What do you think?

695
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,079
I don't know.

696
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,240
Either they really don't care,

697
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:47,160
or they're just hiding their intentions.

698
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:50,319
Maybe they'll intercept us during the transfer.

699
00:29:50,519 --> 00:29:51,319
This...

700
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:54,640
Are we really going to fall out over this list?

701
00:29:55,359 --> 00:29:56,559
It probably won't come to that.

702
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,359
But the Japanese...

703
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,079
They'll definitely be watching us closely.

704
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,599
So for this transfer,

705
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,839
we need to find someone reliable to handle it.

706
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,880
It was originally assigned to Feng Shen.

707
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,960
He's one of Mr. Zhou's trusted men.

708
00:30:13,359 --> 00:30:14,680
His background is clean.

709
00:30:14,839 --> 00:30:16,119
But he's not very capable.

710
00:30:16,519 --> 00:30:17,400
You mean...

711
00:30:18,359 --> 00:30:19,240
It's hard to say.

712
00:30:19,559 --> 00:30:22,319
He might end up being led by the Japanese.

713
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,079
Let Liang Shuo go this time.

714
00:30:27,319 --> 00:30:28,279
Let someone else go.

715
00:30:28,279 --> 00:30:29,279
I still wouldn't feel at ease.

716
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:30,720
Director.

717
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,839
Liang Shuo's relationship with the suspect—

718
00:30:32,839 --> 00:30:33,720
Aren't you worried?

719
00:30:34,519 --> 00:30:36,440
We need people the most right now.

720
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:37,720
Besides,

721
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:40,200
who at headquarters is really clean?

722
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,279
Didn't we all come out of the same dye vat?

723
00:30:42,759 --> 00:30:45,559
Liang Shuo's abilities are unmatched at headquarters.

724
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,839
If he's truly loyal,

725
00:30:48,119 --> 00:30:50,319
I definitely won't treat him unfairly.

726
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,759
The only thing is,

727
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,279
his true nature—

728
00:30:54,279 --> 00:30:57,200
is it white or red?

729
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:00,359
You mean—

730
00:31:01,839 --> 00:31:04,599
Go to the intelligence department and find two unfamiliar faces.

731
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,559
Arrange for them to get in the car.

732
00:31:05,559 --> 00:31:06,640
Have them follow Liang Shuo.

733
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,480
If any problems arise,

734
00:31:09,559 --> 00:31:11,079
show no mercy.

735
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,599
Understood.

736
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:24,519
Secretary Wang.

737
00:31:24,519 --> 00:31:25,599
Everything is ready.

738
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,079
About escorting the prisoner—

739
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:30,160
The director has made new arrangements.

740
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:34,680
You.

741
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:37,680
And you.

742
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:40,079
Come with me.

743
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:52,279
Boss, what's the arrangement?

744
00:31:52,519 --> 00:31:53,160
What's going on?

745
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,119
How would I know?

746
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,480
Hello?

747
00:31:58,359 --> 00:31:59,160
It's me.

748
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,279
Okay.

749
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:06,839
Got it.

750
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:10,960
What's wrong?

751
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,359
The Special Agent Headquarters changed their plan at the last minute.

752
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,640
They canceled the plan to escort Feng Shen.

753
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:17,759
They want me to go.

754
00:32:18,319 --> 00:32:19,440
And they even moved up the escort time

755
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,759
by half an hour.

756
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,920
They want me to return to headquarters right now

757
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,359
to make temporary arrangements.

758
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,799
They want you to do the escort.

759
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:27,960
But at this time,

760
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,480
if we take Sister Fei Man away,

761
00:32:29,559 --> 00:32:31,160
wouldn't you be the most suspicious?

762
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,480
This is a way to ensure the escort's safety.

763
00:32:36,319 --> 00:32:38,079
It's also a test for me.

764
00:32:40,279 --> 00:32:41,359
So what do we do now?

765
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:43,200
Our whole plan is messed up.

766
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:47,319
We have to find a way to inform Old Tan.

767
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,519
At this time,

768
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,759
the rice shop is already closed.

769
00:32:51,839 --> 00:32:52,680
Besides,

770
00:32:52,839 --> 00:32:54,839
Old Tan should have already gone to contact the guerrillas.

771
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,839
How did it end up like this?

772
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,480
Li Hanzhi really isn't easy to deal with.

773
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:03,079
Now we can only take it one step at a time.

774
00:33:14,319 --> 00:33:16,319
How did you end up being the one escorting the suspect?

775
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:20,920
You’re asking me? How would I know?

776
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:23,400
Why don’t you go ask Director Li?

777
00:33:24,599 --> 00:33:27,000
You’re not actually thinking of saving your old flame, are you?

778
00:33:27,319 --> 00:33:29,359
If you had any sense, you’d know

779
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,839
I’m not the one in charge of this.

780
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,359
Did you say something in front of Mizuno Shingen

781
00:33:37,359 --> 00:33:38,319
that you shouldn’t have?

782
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:39,839
You don’t trust me.

783
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,680
But the one who didn’t trust others first

784
00:33:42,039 --> 00:33:43,440
wasn’t me, was it?

785
00:33:45,119 --> 00:33:46,480
Let me give you some advice.

786
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:47,680
This escort operation

787
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,000
has already turned into a trap.

788
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:51,480
Li Hanzhi wants to kill two birds with one stone.

789
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,279
If you’re willing to risk exposing your identity

790
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:54,519
just to get involved,

791
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:55,880
don’t blame me for being ruthless.

792
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:05,759
Where's the prisoner?

793
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:08,440
To be on the safe side,

794
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:09,159
last night, the prisoner

795
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:11,000
was sent ahead and settled near the train station.

796
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:12,760
This is the document signed by Director Li.

797
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:15,679
I'll go pick up the prisoner in a bit.

798
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,559
No need.

799
00:34:16,559 --> 00:34:17,480
Mazi, Lao Bai,

800
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,119
sorry to trouble you, but could you make the trip?

801
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:20,280
Let's meet at the station.

802
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,199
Yes.

803
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:26,119
Is this a temporary assignment from headquarters?

804
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:27,960
Yeah.

805
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:30,239
I didn't even have time to pack a couple of clothes.

806
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:31,599
I was supposed to

807
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:33,599
go to the movies with Yuxin tonight.

808
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:34,960
Looks like that's not happening now.

809
00:34:35,079 --> 00:34:37,239
I'll have to trouble Brother Cui to call her for me.

810
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:38,159
And explain the situation.

811
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,119
Don't worry about that.

812
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,559
If you can get there early, don't dawdle.

813
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:42,639
Go early, come back early.

814
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,000
When you're out on assignment,

815
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:49,599
look out for your teammates.

816
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,119
Don't worry.

817
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,079
Team leader,

818
00:34:59,719 --> 00:35:00,719
didn't they say

819
00:35:00,719 --> 00:35:02,280
we were specially assigned a train car?

820
00:35:02,719 --> 00:35:03,840
Why are there so many people?

821
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:04,800
Stop complaining.

822
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,079
You can't question the higher-ups' arrangements.

823
00:35:08,599 --> 00:35:09,599
It's a temporary adjustment.

824
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:11,480
We're lucky to even have one carriage.

825
00:35:23,559 --> 00:35:24,639
Why are they here?

826
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,079
What are you looking at?

827
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,039
Boss.

828
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:28,800
Boss.

829
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:31,280
We ran into someone we know.

830
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,320
They're from headquarters.

831
00:35:37,039 --> 00:35:38,320
Song Qian and that one.

832
00:35:39,519 --> 00:35:40,719
They're all from the confidential department.

833
00:35:41,199 --> 00:35:42,559
They're on a mission and just passing through.

834
00:35:44,159 --> 00:35:45,320
Since we're all acquaintances,

835
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,719
let's go say hello.

836
00:35:47,239 --> 00:35:47,760
Let's go.

837
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:48,599
Let's go.

838
00:35:49,239 --> 00:35:50,039
Let's go.

839
00:36:20,519 --> 00:36:21,159
Mazi

840
00:36:21,199 --> 00:36:21,960
Mazi

841
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,599
Director Liang

842
00:36:28,039 --> 00:36:28,960
What a coincidence.

843
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:29,920
Be honest.

844
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,159
Why are you following us?

845
00:36:31,159 --> 00:36:32,760
It's a misunderstanding, really!

846
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,679
We're just following orders too.

847
00:36:35,679 --> 00:36:36,519
Following orders?

848
00:36:36,679 --> 00:36:37,800
Whose orders?

849
00:36:38,639 --> 00:36:40,760
You snuck onto the same train car as us.

850
00:36:41,039 --> 00:36:42,400
Do you think I'll believe you?

851
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:47,079
It was Deputy Director Huang's idea.

852
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:49,840
He told us to secretly keep an eye on the suspect.

853
00:36:51,199 --> 00:36:53,000
We didn't expect you to be so sharp, Director Liang.

854
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,639
You recognized us right away.

855
00:37:01,559 --> 00:37:02,360
Director Liang

856
00:37:04,599 --> 00:37:05,639
We're really not lying to you.

857
00:37:06,559 --> 00:37:09,119
The higher-ups were worried something might happen during the transfer.

858
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,679
So they had us follow along.

859
00:37:10,679 --> 00:37:11,559
We mean no harm.

860
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,880
You two idiots.

861
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:24,920
Since you've been found out,

862
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:25,920
just join the team.

863
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,159
Good thing our boss is in a good mood today.

864
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,960
Otherwise, I wonder how you'd explain yourselves when you got back.

865
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:31,639
Thank you, Director Liang.

866
00:37:31,719 --> 00:37:32,519
Mazi

867
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,079
You take the team back.

868
00:37:36,239 --> 00:37:36,960
Boss

869
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,599
Why are you sending us back?

870
00:37:38,599 --> 00:37:40,039
Isn't it obvious, Director?

871
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:43,400
Since headquarters arranged it,

872
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,599
let them stay.

873
00:37:44,639 --> 00:37:45,800
I don't like too many people around.

874
00:37:46,039 --> 00:37:47,199
Too many people attract attention.

875
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:48,880
Yes.

876
00:37:49,519 --> 00:37:50,320
Yes.

877
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,519
You go back to headquarters and call for reinforcements.

878
00:37:57,519 --> 00:37:58,840
Gather the members of Team One.

879
00:37:58,840 --> 00:37:59,920
Wait for me at Changzhou Station.

880
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:00,960
I have my own arrangements.

881
00:38:01,239 --> 00:38:02,039
Understood.

882
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:09,599
Director.

883
00:38:11,159 --> 00:38:12,280
Song Qian sent word.

884
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,760
The two of them have already been exposed.

885
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,360
They are now following Liang Shuo's actions.

886
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:16,880
Useless.

887
00:38:17,519 --> 00:38:18,719
But you can't really blame them.

888
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,519
If it were up to Liang Shuo's sharp eyes,

889
00:38:21,519 --> 00:38:22,480
and he couldn't spot anything unusual,

890
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,559
that would actually be strange.

891
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,119
Tell me,

892
00:38:30,119 --> 00:38:32,559
was it a bit much to have them watch Liang Shuo?

893
00:38:33,159 --> 00:38:34,960
Was I being too cautious?

894
00:38:37,159 --> 00:38:38,360
Director, being cautious

895
00:38:38,599 --> 00:38:40,000
is never wrong.

896
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,519
Director, in my opinion,

897
00:38:42,719 --> 00:38:44,320
there's no need to monitor Liang Shuo.

898
00:38:44,599 --> 00:38:46,400
As long as the suspect Jiang Feiman

899
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,800
can safely arrive in Nanjing,

900
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:51,960
that proves Liang Shuo is trustworthy.

901
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:01,679
Director Liang.

902
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:02,599
Director Liang.

903
00:39:07,239 --> 00:39:08,480
Director Liang.

904
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,159
You all have probably heard

905
00:39:14,159 --> 00:39:16,159
about my previous relationship with Miss Jiang.

906
00:39:21,079 --> 00:39:22,039
Could you give me

907
00:39:22,039 --> 00:39:23,880
a moment to say a few words to her?

908
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,239
Go pour me a cup of tea.

909
00:39:28,039 --> 00:39:29,039
Yes, Director Liang.

910
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:32,199
I'm going out for a smoke.

911
00:39:36,679 --> 00:39:37,760
Go get a glass of water.

912
00:39:39,679 --> 00:39:40,480
You go with him.

913
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,920
You shouldn't take this risk.

914
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,119
Letting me watch my own comrades die

915
00:39:53,199 --> 00:39:54,320
is something I can't do.

916
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,280
I've already contacted Lao Tan.

917
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,920
I've arranged for comrades from Jiangbei to rescue you.

918
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,000
Have you thought about

919
00:40:00,239 --> 00:40:01,119
if I get rescued,

920
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:02,719
you won't be able to clear your own suspicion.

921
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:03,960
I have my own way.

922
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,480
This is the key.

923
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,239
After they rescue you,

924
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:09,920
you can choose the right time to open it.

925
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:12,519
You know very well

926
00:40:12,519 --> 00:40:14,440
that both Mizuno Shingen and Li Hanzhi don't trust you.

927
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,840
We've gone through so much to get to this point

928
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:18,079
all for Qianyuan.

929
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,400
Now we even have a lead on the list.

930
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,880
You shouldn't lose sight of the bigger picture for something small.

931
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,280
Besides,

932
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,320
Xie Jun'an doesn't trust you either.

933
00:40:24,599 --> 00:40:26,679
He probably can't even protect himself right now.

934
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,159
Besides,

935
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,199
for me right now,

936
00:40:31,199 --> 00:40:33,079
protecting the people around me is the most important thing.

937
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,559
Have you thought about yourself?

938
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:40,440
There are no perfect solutions in this world.

939
00:40:40,599 --> 00:40:42,239
Only if I am sent to Nanjing

940
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,880
can you continue your undercover work.

941
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:45,840
Some things

942
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,639
are destined to never change.

943
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,360
If I say it can be done, it can be done.

944
00:40:51,159 --> 00:40:53,079
I don't have time to argue with you about this right now.

945
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,679
Li Hanzhi has moved up the departure time.

946
00:40:56,159 --> 00:40:58,239
I'm afraid it will miss the timing with the comrades coming to rescue you.

947
00:40:59,239 --> 00:41:00,639
There's only one way now.

948
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,880
I'll find a way to stop the train.

949
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:03,840
Switch to the highway.

950
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:04,519
You—

951
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:06,800
You're taking too big a risk.

952
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,320
How will you clear yourself of suspicion?

953
00:41:10,599 --> 00:41:12,199
I am confident I can save you.

954
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,079
You have to trust me.

955
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,119
Your tea.

956
00:41:19,039 --> 00:41:19,840
Stand over there.

957
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:27,800
Come in.

958
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,400
There's new information from Brother Zhonghai.

959
00:41:36,559 --> 00:41:37,320
What is it?

960
00:41:37,519 --> 00:41:38,719
Number 76 is on alert.

961
00:41:38,719 --> 00:41:40,280
The escort time has been moved up by half an hour.
