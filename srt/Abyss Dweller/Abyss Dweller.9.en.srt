1
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,079
Teacher

2
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:50,640
We have no choice but to risk everything.

3
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:53,000
We all need time.

4
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:54,959
Especially Liang Shuo.

5
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:56,959
We're running out of time.

6
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,920
If we miss this opportunity,

7
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,159
the Snow Blind Project will be left to fate.

8
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:03,159
There will definitely be a way.

9
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:07,200
Keep a close watch on Liang Shuo.

10
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:10,759
The newly transferred people

11
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,479
have they noticed anything unusual?

12
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:13,520
No.

13
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,520
On the contrary, the reports

14
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,680
all say that Director Liang is highly capable.

15
00:02:17,719 --> 00:02:19,000
The subordinates admire him a lot.

16
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:20,520
Director

17
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,319
In my opinion,

18
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,159
there really isn't any problem with Liang Shuo.

19
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,439
After all, he's been part of your old team.

20
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,560
This is Chen Gengsheng's report.

21
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:31,520
Take a look.

22
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,960
Is Chen Gengsheng crazy?

23
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,080
What is this?

24
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:46,280
He even wrote down being late and leaving early.

25
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:48,120
Does he have delusions?

26
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:51,199
I don't need to read the rest.

27
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,400
It's probably all baseless speculation.

28
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:54,159
Director.

29
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,400
Chen Gengsheng and Liang Shuo

30
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,639
have a longstanding grudge.

31
00:02:57,919 --> 00:02:59,439
Ever since his older brother was caught for corruption and bribery

32
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:00,599
by Liang Shuo,

33
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:02,479
he has held a grudge against Liang Shuo.

34
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,360
Also,

35
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,280
our headquarters

36
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,199
is currently selecting

37
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:06,919
backup security personnel for the Peace Conference.

38
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:08,199
If Liang Shuo weren't here,

39
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,599
he would have the best chance.

40
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,240
That's why he's been looking for a chance to get rid of Liang Shuo.

41
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,439
This is also

42
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:17,360
the reason I use Chen Gengsheng.

43
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,759
He pays more attention to Liang Shuo

44
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,960
than most people do.

45
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,120
The director is still uneasy about Liang Shuo

46
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,759
and remains concerned.

47
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,680
This is a matter of great importance.

48
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:33,680
We have to be cautious.

49
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:36,879
The Peace Conference is approaching.

50
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,719
In front of the Japanese,

51
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:42,080
we can't afford any mistakes.

52
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:44,000
But I heard

53
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,080
the Japanese have eased their attitude toward Liang Shuo.

54
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,680
They are much more relaxed now.

55
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,199
I also hope he is innocent.

56
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,000
When the time comes,

57
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,199
the more of our own people at the conference,

58
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:55,360
the safer it will be.

59
00:03:56,039 --> 00:03:57,199
Just take a look.

60
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,759
It's just for reference.

61
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:01,000
Understood.

62
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,560
By the way,

63
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,039
when you met with Liang Shuo before,

64
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:07,680
the girl who got away,

65
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,960
have you found her?

66
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,199
I've been investigating.

67
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,759
There are no leads so far.

68
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,479
I'm just worried

69
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:14,800
that things aren't that simple.

70
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,000
Given the current situation,

71
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,240
we can't handle any more trouble.

72
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:20,560
Don't worry, Director.

73
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,360
I will definitely get to the bottom of this.

74
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,759
Since you want to investigate,

75
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:26,360
give it your all.

76
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,519
Don't wait until a direct confrontation.

77
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:30,639
That would be even more awkward.

78
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:33,480
You know,

79
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,600
don't feel burdened by this.

80
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,720
You're doing this for his own good.

81
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:39,199
You don't want him

82
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,800
to carry this suspicion forever, do you?

83
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,199
You're right, Director.

84
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:00,639
Do you think

85
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,680
I'm usually too strict with you?

86
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,160
Lao Xie, if you have something to say, just say it.

87
00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:07,959
The way you're flattering me right now

88
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:09,199
is really creepy.

89
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,319
Watch your manners.

90
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:17,639
The Peace Conference is about to begin.

91
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:18,639
It's just around the corner.

92
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:21,319
We don't have much time left.

93
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:23,439
The most important thing right now

94
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,240
is to wake up Liang Shuo.

95
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:27,199
I can ignore everything else.

96
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:28,879
You understand, right?

97
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,120
What about all that corruption?

98
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,360
You're not going to deal with that either, are you?

99
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,319
It's because of people like you at the top

100
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:39,199
who always turn a blind eye

101
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,279
that those below

102
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:42,399
end up becoming greedy parasites.

103
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:44,839
Now the country is riddled with problems.

104
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,120
This situation

105
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,600
is something you can't escape responsibility for.

106
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,439
You have no respect for your elders.

107
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:50,680
You don't understand proper manners.

108
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,000
It's not your place to lecture me.

109
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,600
Matters

110
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,959
always have priorities.

111
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,759
Right now, the Japanese have a knife to our throats.

112
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:03,480
Who cares about those maggots in your flesh at a time like this?

113
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:06,079
You need to do your own job well.

114
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,319
Wake up Liang Shuo.

115
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,920
That's an order.

116
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,000
I have nothing to do with him.

117
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,240
How am I supposed to wake him up?

118
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,360
This isn't something

119
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,800
you can clear up with just a few words.

120
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,000
In the world of spies,

121
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:20,240
there are no coincidences.

122
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:21,759
Cui Mo has already seen

123
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:23,399
you appear by Liang Shuo's side.

124
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,560
Your relationship has already been confirmed.

125
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,279
If you suddenly disappear,

126
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,959
it will arouse suspicion.

127
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:34,519
Then what do you

128
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:36,079
actually want me to do?

129
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:41,680
Get close to Liang Shuo.

130
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,720
Like an ordinary girl,

131
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:45,439
appear in his life.

132
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:46,600
Openly

133
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,920
interact with him.

134
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:50,879
Aren't you helping out at Fenghua Clothing Store?

135
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,120
Keep being Xie Yuxin.

136
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,399
Be his friend,

137
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,759
or

138
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,079
his lover.

139
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:00,240
What?

140
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:01,160
Are you afraid,

141
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:02,759
or can't do it?

142
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,160
In his current state,

143
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,279
he can't keep up the act for long.

144
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:10,519
Besides,

145
00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:12,480
he doesn't follow your orders anymore.

146
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,120
I don't care about that.

147
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,399
As long as during the Peace Conference

148
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:18,279
he keeps an eye on No. 76 for me.

149
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,040
Director, please.

150
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,399
Director.

151
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:49,079
Are we going home or somewhere else?

152
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:51,839
Home.

153
00:07:55,879 --> 00:07:56,720
Do you know the way?

154
00:07:58,199 --> 00:07:58,800
Yes, I do.

155
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,079
Captain Bai has already given instructions.

156
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,040
Which route to take,

157
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:01,879
how to go safely,

158
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:03,319
ensuring your safety is the most important.

159
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:03,720
Don't worry.

160
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,839
I've remembered everything, Director.

161
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,040
Then let's go.

162
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,800
Your name is Zhao Di.

163
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:19,439
Director, reporting.

164
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:20,000
Yes.

165
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,000
The new one.

166
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:21,879
That's right.

167
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,920
Zhao, as in Zhao from Zhao Qian Sun Li.

168
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,800
Di, as in Di from Qidi.

169
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:25,800
Transferred here specially from the General Affairs Department.

170
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,000
Let us

171
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,319
work hard under your leadership, Director.

172
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,800
You all

173
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,000
Yes.

174
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,919
Two other colleagues were transferred here with me.

175
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,360
I was relatively lucky.

176
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,639
Arranged to be by your side.

177
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:40,519
Assigning three people at once.

178
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,440
The General Affairs Office is really generous.

179
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,480
It was Director Li.

180
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,559
He arranged it specially.

181
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:47,399
He said you worked hard on this trip, Director.

182
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:48,799
And you were wronged as well.

183
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:49,919
So he wanted to send more people.

184
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:50,960
To take care of your daily needs.

185
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,519
The director is really considerate.

186
00:08:56,279 --> 00:08:57,440
I’m just lucky.

187
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:58,759
To be able to work by your side.

188
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,039
Director.

189
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,399
From now on, I’m yours.

190
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,480
If you need anything,

191
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,519
just let me know.

192
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,360
Since you’re here,

193
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:08,799
work diligently.

194
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:10,440
I happen to need people right now.

195
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,440
Do a good job.

196
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,600
You won’t be treated unfairly.

197
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:14,000
Understood, Director.

198
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:16,879
Although I’m newly transferred,

199
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:17,919
your character—

200
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:19,200
they’ve all told me about it.

201
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,679
No need to flatter me.

202
00:09:25,159 --> 00:09:26,679
What did they say about me?

203
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:27,840
Let’s hear it.

204
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,440
Director

205
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,240
We've arrived.

206
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:11,480
Director Liang

207
00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:14,159
Key

208
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,039
I almost forgot.

209
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:18,679
Alright, I'll head back now.

210
00:10:18,679 --> 00:10:19,799
I'll pick you up on time tomorrow.

211
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:20,480
Okay.

212
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,440
Please get some good rest.

213
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:22,480
Thank you for your hard work.

214
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:23,639
It's my duty.

215
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:02,639
Brother Liang

216
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,879
Show some mercy

217
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,360
When did you learn

218
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,240
to act like thieves?

219
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:09,440
These are extraordinary times

220
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:11,159
so we must do extraordinary things

221
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,799
That really sounds like him

222
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,039
You’re here to force me to take the mission, aren’t you?

223
00:15:20,679 --> 00:15:22,720
The teacher trained you for the Snow Blind Project

224
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:25,960
Do you still care about organizational discipline?

225
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:29,759
Military Command’s rules are meant to restrain you

226
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,759
not me

227
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,399
The Snow Blind operation isn’t just your business

228
00:15:37,799 --> 00:15:39,240
I don’t owe anyone anything

229
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:40,840
If I owe anyone

230
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,639
it’s only Uncle Yan

231
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:43,559
Enough

232
00:15:46,039 --> 00:15:47,279
From now on

233
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:50,039
I don’t want any more involvement with Military Command

234
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:51,919
Don’t bother me again

235
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:53,000
Liang Shuo

236
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,320
Do you really think that without you

237
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,600
we can’t get things done?

238
00:15:57,159 --> 00:15:58,000
Cheng Chun

239
00:15:58,679 --> 00:15:59,480
Let’s go

240
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,759
The people from the Military Bureau

241
00:16:35,799 --> 00:16:38,000
Why did they let him go so easily?

242
00:16:39,639 --> 00:16:40,440
This is clearly not

243
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,440
a punitive action against a traitor.

244
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:44,919
Liang Shuo,

245
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:48,399
what secrets are you still hiding?

246
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:58,359
Sino-Japanese prosperity is the trend of the times.

247
00:17:58,359 --> 00:18:01,039
Peaceful coexistence lays the foundation for a hundred generations.

248
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:01,960
Come, child.

249
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:03,559
Okay.

250
00:18:03,559 --> 00:18:04,400
Thank you, sir.

251
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:09,319
Extra, extra! Newspaper headlines!

252
00:18:09,519 --> 00:18:12,599
Sino-Japanese prosperity is the trend of the times.

253
00:18:12,599 --> 00:18:15,960
Extra, extra! Newspaper headlines!

254
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:19,039
Sino-Japanese prosperity is the trend of the times.

255
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,960
That's how things are.

256
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,000
Lao Tan.

257
00:18:22,359 --> 00:18:23,119
Go ahead.

258
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,519
Could Liang Shuo be

259
00:18:24,519 --> 00:18:26,880
a Military Command undercover agent planted in No. 76?

260
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,599
But if that's really the case,

261
00:18:30,119 --> 00:18:31,400
there are still many things

262
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,880
that can't be explained.

263
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:34,880
Fei Man.

264
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,279
Based on the information you provided

265
00:18:37,279 --> 00:18:40,039
and the intelligence we currently have,

266
00:18:40,599 --> 00:18:41,519
Liang Shuo

267
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,400
is safe for now.

268
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:45,599
Whether from the Military Command's side

269
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:46,799
or from No. 76,

270
00:18:47,079 --> 00:18:48,079
the concerns have been resolved.

271
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:50,240
This matter

272
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:53,039
it's time to tell you.

273
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:54,519
Lao Tan.

274
00:18:54,519 --> 00:18:55,880
What do you want to say?

275
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,519
Liang Shuo

276
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,200
is one of our comrades.

277
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,039
What?

278
00:19:06,039 --> 00:19:08,039
He was recruited by Comrade Maple.

279
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:09,640
His code name is Qingshuang.

280
00:19:10,359 --> 00:19:12,519
Comrade Maple reported this to me

281
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,119
a long time ago.

282
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:15,799
However,

283
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,640
because Liang Shuo's identity is special

284
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:20,079
and extremely important,

285
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:22,000
he absolutely cannot be exposed.

286
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,119
So all along,

287
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:27,000
only Comrade Maple has been in direct contact with him.

288
00:19:28,279 --> 00:19:30,720
Now that Comrade Maple has been lost,

289
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:34,160
I have already applied to the organization

290
00:19:34,359 --> 00:19:36,039
for you to take Comrade Maple's place

291
00:19:36,359 --> 00:19:38,319
and continue the connection with Liang Shuo.

292
00:19:38,599 --> 00:19:41,119
The organization has now approved this.

293
00:19:41,279 --> 00:19:43,599
So there's no need to keep it secret from you anymore.

294
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:46,000
I didn't expect

295
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,640
he was one of our own.

296
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,200
Isn't the organization worried about our previous relationship?

297
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,480
On this point,

298
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,559
the organization completely trusts you both.

299
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:02,519
Moreover,

300
00:20:02,759 --> 00:20:04,519
precisely because of your previous relationship,

301
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:07,079
given Liang Shuo's current situation,

302
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,359
having you make contact

303
00:20:08,599 --> 00:20:10,279
might be more appropriate.

304
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:16,440
The organization hopes to judge through your observation

305
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:20,440
whether Liang Shuo can still adapt to undercover work.

306
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,640
If he can't adapt,

307
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:24,400
we need to find a way

308
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,960
to rescue him as soon as possible.

309
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:27,799
Of course,

310
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,200
the worst-case scenario is

311
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,440
Qingshuang

312
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,599
has already forgotten his own identity.

313
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:41,839
What if that's the case?

314
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,359
If that's the case,

315
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:50,160
we also need to find a way

316
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,279
to guide him

317
00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:52,400
and awaken him.

318
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,920
We must have faith in him.

319
00:20:55,319 --> 00:20:56,839
As long as his true intentions remain unchanged,

320
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,359
we should believe

321
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:00,519
that he can return to us once again.

322
00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:02,880
I understand.

323
00:21:03,079 --> 00:21:04,039
Feiman,

324
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,119
right now,

325
00:21:07,319 --> 00:21:08,880
we urgently need the medical supplies

326
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,880
left behind by Comrade Fengye.

327
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,759
And there's another

328
00:21:12,759 --> 00:21:14,160
even more important task

329
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,920
that needs to be assigned to Liang Shuo.

330
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,559
The specific details of this task

331
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,720
can only be shared with you

332
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,880
after I get approval from the organization.

333
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:22,319
I hope you can understand.

334
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,240
I understand.

335
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,079
According to the intelligence previously gathered by Comrade Fengye,

336
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,480
the Peace Conference

337
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:33,279
It's not as simple as it seems.

338
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:36,559
What is really hidden behind it

339
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,880
between the Wang Jingwei government and the Japanese

340
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,559
are the dirty deals

341
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,160
What exactly are they plotting

342
00:21:43,759 --> 00:21:45,519
and what kind of actions and plans

343
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:46,440
In their hands

344
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,599
what bargaining chips and weapons do they have

345
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:52,319
If Liang Shuo can return

346
00:21:52,759 --> 00:21:54,240
he will be

347
00:21:54,599 --> 00:21:56,519
our eyes in the storm

348
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,720
So

349
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:00,200
this matter is of great importance

350
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,960
and there can be no carelessness

351
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:03,759
Alright

352
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,759
I'll try to approach him carefully

353
00:22:06,039 --> 00:22:07,079
In undercover work

354
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,720
the most important thing is not to be exposed

355
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:12,240
so we can't rush it

356
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,559
As long as safety is ensured

357
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,559
Remember

358
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,279
the contact code is

359
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,759
"Frost tipsy on maple leaves"

360
00:22:21,319 --> 00:22:23,599
"Faint moon hides among reed flowers"

361
00:22:43,839 --> 00:22:44,440
Director

362
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:45,799
I brought this for you

363
00:22:48,079 --> 00:22:49,400
Did I ask you to bring it?

364
00:22:49,559 --> 00:22:50,359
What is it?

365
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,559
Tiger claws

366
00:22:51,559 --> 00:22:52,559
A Shanghai specialty

367
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,039
Director, you've been in Shanghai for so many years

368
00:22:58,119 --> 00:22:59,240
haven't you tried this?

369
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,039
It's greasy

370
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:04,119
I don't have much of an appetite

371
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:05,920
Director

372
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:06,799
Try one

373
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:08,160
Their place makes it especially tasty

374
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:15,880
Thanks

375
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:24,759
Director

376
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,799
What kind of breakfast do you like?

377
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:28,319
Do you prefer sweet or savory?

378
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:29,200
I'll bring it for you.

379
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,200
It's arranged by the department.

380
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,160
And it's all reimbursed together.

381
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,039
I don't have to pay for it.

382
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,400
Just do as you see fit.

383
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:36,599
My stomach hasn't been feeling well lately.

384
00:23:36,599 --> 00:23:37,759
Something light is fine.

385
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:38,960
Got it.

386
00:23:40,359 --> 00:23:41,599
Is it arranged by the department

387
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,200
or is it Secretary Wang's special care?

388
00:23:43,519 --> 00:23:45,079
Secretary Wang specifically asked me to.

389
00:23:45,079 --> 00:23:46,799
He said I must take good care of you.

390
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:50,920
Having a young man like you look after me,

391
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
you're probably not used to it, right?

392
00:23:53,079 --> 00:23:54,240
Not at all, Director.

393
00:23:54,359 --> 00:23:55,240
Being able to take care of you

394
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,240
is my honor.

395
00:24:01,079 --> 00:24:01,880
Zhao Di,

396
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,480
how are you getting along with your colleagues?

397
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,480
Ma Zi and the others aren't bullying you, are they?

398
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,920
No, no, not at all.

399
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,640
The guys are really nice to me.

400
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,680
Group Leader Yu,

401
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,480
he may look a bit fierce,

402
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,440
and he speaks a bit harshly,

403
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,839
sometimes even gets physical,

404
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:15,799
but actually,

405
00:24:15,799 --> 00:24:17,119
he's very loyal.

406
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:19,079
Captain Bai seems sharp,

407
00:24:19,079 --> 00:24:20,359
but when it comes to the team's food, clothing, and needs,

408
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:21,759
he never skimps on anything.

409
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:24,519
Even though those two bicker and mess around,

410
00:24:24,599 --> 00:24:25,839
I actually feel

411
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:28,200
they must be really close in private.

412
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,200
You observe things quite carefully.

413
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,279
Good morning, Director Liang.

414
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,160
Good morning, Director.

415
00:25:05,759 --> 00:25:06,559
Boss.

416
00:25:08,279 --> 00:25:09,039
Boss.

417
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:10,559
So cool.

418
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:11,920
Now that's more like you.

419
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,720
When you first came back, I barely recognized you.

420
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,359
What are you drinking?

421
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:18,480
Soy milk.

422
00:25:18,759 --> 00:25:19,920
Did you put too much sugar in it?

423
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:20,960
Your mouth is so sweet.

424
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:22,160
How about you—

425
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,359
I’ll go get you a cup.

426
00:25:23,359 --> 00:25:24,160
No need.

427
00:25:24,279 --> 00:25:25,079
I knew it.

428
00:25:25,079 --> 00:25:26,799
Boss doesn’t like your weird stuff.

429
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,640
Who would drink something so sickly sweet?

430
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,720
You have to add soy sauce to soy milk.

431
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,519
Otherwise, it has no soul.

432
00:25:30,519 --> 00:25:31,160
You know that, right?

433
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,599
What do you mean, my weird stuff?

434
00:25:32,599 --> 00:25:34,359
I just like it sweet, so what?

435
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:36,160
Who puts soy sauce in their drink in the morning?

436
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,440
And look at your hair.

437
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,680
Looks like you smeared soy sauce on it.

438
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,440
Fine, you don’t believe me?

439
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,000
Alright, come on.

440
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,039
Let’s get a second opinion.

441
00:25:42,039 --> 00:25:42,799
How do you drink it?

442
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:43,359
You tell us.

443
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,039
Enough.

444
00:25:44,039 --> 00:25:44,559
You—

445
00:25:44,759 --> 00:25:45,920
Don’t you two have anything better to do?

446
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,440
You’re so bored you’re arguing over nothing.

447
00:25:47,559 --> 00:25:48,839
You two are obviously close.

448
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,880
You can’t go a minute without bickering, can you?

449
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,240
Who’s close with him?

450
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,559
Who wants to hang out with you?

451
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,759
You two, come in.

452
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,880
The General Affairs Office sent three people over to me.

453
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:08,599
Yeah.

454
00:26:08,599 --> 00:26:09,599
They're really attentive.

455
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,480
Do you ever use your brain?

456
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,200
The Japanese came by once.

457
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,440
Now the General Affairs Office thinks I'm easy to push around, right?

458
00:26:19,799 --> 00:26:20,720
That's what it means.

459
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,000
Boss.

460
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,319
I, Scarface, only respect you.

461
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,400
If the General Affairs Office bullies you again,

462
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,519
I'll go make trouble for them.

463
00:26:25,839 --> 00:26:27,720
Or just send them back.

464
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,400
Say we don't need more people here.

465
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,200
We don't take in useless people.

466
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,240
They can go wherever they want.

467
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,200
Forget it.

468
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,720
If we do that, the General Affairs Office will have

469
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,480
an excuse to argue with me.

470
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,119
Lao Bai.

471
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,119
That's why I say you don't think.

472
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,160
If you had a brain,

473
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,799
wouldn't you still go make trouble at the General Affairs Office?

474
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:44,880
Fine, fine, you're the smart one.

475
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:45,720
You tell me what to do.

476
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,480
I...

477
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,480
What do you mean, "I"?

478
00:26:49,559 --> 00:26:51,759
I'll do whatever the boss says.

479
00:26:51,759 --> 00:26:53,759
Look at you.

480
00:26:53,839 --> 00:26:55,039
Since that's the case,

481
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,400
don't back out now.

482
00:26:58,079 --> 00:26:59,039
Stay here.

483
00:26:59,559 --> 00:27:00,680
Don't keep too much distance.

484
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:03,279
Don't let them think we're being wary.

485
00:27:03,759 --> 00:27:04,559
Lao Bai,

486
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,839
what do you think of these three?

487
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,799
I've been observing Zhao Di for a while.

488
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:12,240
He's pretty sharp.

489
00:27:12,319 --> 00:27:13,759
I also did a background check.

490
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:14,880
He doesn't have any powerful connections.

491
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:15,799
He's easy to win over.

492
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:18,000
I heard he's pretty capable too.

493
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,039
Or,

494
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:20,240
let him follow you.

495
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,400
Just in case those people try to cause trouble.

496
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:24,480
As for the others,

497
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:27,839
if they don't work out, send them out on fieldwork.

498
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,319
So they don't get in your way.

499
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,160
Alright.

500
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:34,799
Let Zhao Di stay.

501
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,519
Set up a workstation for him outside.

502
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,480
Put the other two in the team for fieldwork.

503
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,240
Yes.

504
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:18,599
Face me

505
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,240
Mr. Lu

506
00:28:52,519 --> 00:28:54,119
I wonder how you feel seeing your former colleagues

507
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,440
What are your thoughts?

508
00:30:01,079 --> 00:30:01,880
Xiao Si

509
00:30:02,039 --> 00:30:02,799
Brother

510
00:30:03,359 --> 00:30:04,599
Turn back

511
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,720
Mr. Lu

512
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,119
Please have some tea

513
00:30:28,759 --> 00:30:29,759
In just a few days

514
00:30:30,359 --> 00:30:31,480
He appeared twice

515
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,119
It was truly unexpected

516
00:30:34,359 --> 00:30:36,640
Scorpio actually used such extreme methods

517
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,079
I thought

518
00:30:38,079 --> 00:30:40,200
he was a cautious and cunning agent

519
00:30:40,519 --> 00:30:42,000
It was unexpected

520
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,480
but also made sense

521
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,079
Like a hawk hunting a rabbit

522
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,599
If he misses, he flees immediately

523
00:30:48,599 --> 00:30:50,079
That's Scorpio's style

524
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,480
Mr. Lu

525
00:30:52,279 --> 00:30:54,119
That's quite a high compliment

526
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,960
The longer you spend with someone

527
00:30:57,519 --> 00:30:58,839
the better you naturally understand them

528
00:31:00,279 --> 00:31:01,839
A worthy opponent to look forward to

529
00:31:02,359 --> 00:31:03,799
But compared to this

530
00:31:03,839 --> 00:31:05,400
what makes me even more curious is

531
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,319
what kind of feelings does Mr. Lu have

532
00:31:07,319 --> 00:31:09,519
to praise someone he hates

533
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,359
This has nothing to do with Mr. Mizuno.

534
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,960
Do you know why I admire Mr. Lu?

535
00:31:20,839 --> 00:31:23,200
Because Mr. Lu is a very genuine person.

536
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,240
He doesn't pretend to be righteous or speak in empty morals.

537
00:31:26,359 --> 00:31:27,359
He is straightforward about gratitude and grudges.

538
00:31:28,039 --> 00:31:29,319
Simple and direct.

539
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,559
I like dealing with people like that.

540
00:31:32,519 --> 00:31:34,279
What Mr. Mizuno means is,

541
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,000
as a weapon,

542
00:31:36,599 --> 00:31:38,519
it's best to have no thoughts of your own.

543
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:41,000
Like pure, forged steel.

544
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,119
It can withstand any sharpening.

545
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,799
Mr. Lu is someone who can be put to great use.

546
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:51,480
If Mr. Mizuno needs me to do anything,

547
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,160
please just say it directly.

548
00:31:56,319 --> 00:31:57,319
Compared to Scorpio,

549
00:31:58,519 --> 00:32:00,160
there is someone who worries me even more.

550
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,359
This agent is hiding in the shadows.

551
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,839
He is directly connected to you.

552
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:06,880
He is the one we have identified

553
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:09,000
as the other twin agent within the Bureau.

554
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,079
The other agent.

555
00:32:10,599 --> 00:32:11,839
Every time I close my eyes,

556
00:32:11,839 --> 00:32:13,319
I can hear his breathing.

557
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:14,920
He is very close to us.

558
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,920
But we still can't catch him.

559
00:32:17,319 --> 00:32:19,440
According to Hirata's intelligence,

560
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:21,839
this person is hiding right in the agent headquarters.

561
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:26,640
His codename

562
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:27,799
is

563
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:28,720
Shadow.

564
00:32:32,039 --> 00:32:33,720
If Mr. Mizuno trusts me,

565
00:32:34,759 --> 00:32:36,160
I'm willing to give it a try.

566
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:39,000
I'll help Mr. Mizuno find this Shadow.

567
00:32:40,519 --> 00:32:41,319
I believe

568
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:44,119
this is also what Mr. Lu wants.

569
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,720
To prove to your teacher

570
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,680
how wrong their choice was.

571
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,519
Before that,

572
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,799
I have a gift for Mr. Lu.

573
00:33:10,319 --> 00:33:12,480
This was custom-made specifically for Mr. Lu.

574
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,680
Mr. Mizuno, what do you mean by this?

575
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:17,880
Are you mocking me, Mr. Lu?

576
00:33:19,359 --> 00:33:21,640
Humiliation can become a driving force in life.

577
00:33:21,839 --> 00:33:23,359
Mr. Lu, perhaps you could see it as

578
00:33:23,359 --> 00:33:24,559
a well-intentioned reminder.

579
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:25,480
A constant reminder to yourself

580
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:27,039
of why you ended up in this situation,

581
00:33:27,319 --> 00:33:29,400
and how you can endure hardship to make a comeback.

582
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,079
To wash away your shame.

583
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:00,440
Come in.

584
00:34:05,359 --> 00:34:06,160
Chief.

585
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,239
How did the investigation on those two girls go?

586
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,960
We didn't find anything useful.

587
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:15,079
What did you say?

588
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:17,119
I said we didn't find anything useful.

589
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:18,840
Then keep investigating.

590
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:20,800
Get to the bottom of it for me.

591
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,800
Where has Liang Shuo been these past few days?

592
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,440
Has he met with this woman?

593
00:34:24,559 --> 00:34:25,360
Yes.

594
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:43,920
Stop the car.

595
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,079
The weather is nice today.

596
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,480
I'll walk over by myself.

597
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:50,719
You can head back first.

598
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:08,880
What are you doing here?

599
00:35:09,559 --> 00:35:10,719
I have something to say to you.

600
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,960
This isn't the place to talk.

601
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:14,760
Come with me.

602
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:22,280
Come in.

603
00:35:29,559 --> 00:35:30,440
Are you okay?

604
00:35:31,079 --> 00:35:33,280
I heard you almost lost your life.

605
00:35:33,559 --> 00:35:34,719
I wrongly blamed you.

606
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,440
You still haven't told me

607
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,559
how you got involved with Xie Jun'an.

608
00:35:40,559 --> 00:35:41,599
He's my uncle.

609
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:43,719
Sorry.

610
00:35:44,119 --> 00:35:45,800
I didn't know you were related to him.

611
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,920
No wonder you also have the surname Xie.

612
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,239
Have a seat.

613
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,119
But

614
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,079
My name isn't Xie Yuxin

615
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,039
My real name is Nian Ci

616
00:36:04,039 --> 00:36:05,039
Xie Nian Ci

617
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:06,559
I promise you

618
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,199
From now on, I won't hide anything from you

619
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,199
So the two of them couldn't persuade me

620
00:36:16,679 --> 00:36:18,360
So they sent you to convince me

621
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,039
But let me tell you

622
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,880
No matter who I was before

623
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:27,880
Or what I've done

624
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,639
From now on

625
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:32,440
I don't want any more involvement with the Bureau

626
00:36:33,159 --> 00:36:34,840
I just want to live a good life

627
00:36:35,079 --> 00:36:36,079
Do you understand?

628
00:36:37,559 --> 00:36:39,119
But Old Xie won't give up until he gets what he wants

629
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:40,559
He absolutely won't let you go

630
00:36:41,559 --> 00:36:42,960
Just give him the item

631
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:45,639
Make a deal with him

632
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:46,840
Right

633
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,480
I'll go talk to him

634
00:36:48,559 --> 00:36:49,800
You make a deal with him

635
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:50,599
Give him the item

636
00:36:50,599 --> 00:36:51,440
So he'll let you go

637
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,519
Then find a chance to escape from No. 76

638
00:36:53,559 --> 00:36:54,519
And get out of Shanghai

639
00:36:57,239 --> 00:36:58,599
You don't have to look at me like that

640
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,559
If you don't want to give him the item, that's fine too

641
00:37:02,519 --> 00:37:03,719
I'll figure something out myself

642
00:37:04,039 --> 00:37:05,320
I'll go now

643
00:37:05,719 --> 00:37:06,760
Wait a moment

644
00:37:27,159 --> 00:37:28,320
The thing he wants

645
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,320
If you're willing to trust me

646
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,400
No. 17, Pingjia Lane

647
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,400
A residential house

648
00:37:33,519 --> 00:37:34,800
There's a passage under the bed

649
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:36,639
Because it's not under Yan Jiu's name

650
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,159
So the Japanese didn't find it

651
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:39,679
Got it

652
00:37:41,039 --> 00:37:42,559
Handing it over to you

653
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,840
I've done all I can

654
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,239
I know

655
00:37:48,519 --> 00:37:49,679
You don't owe him anything

656
00:37:49,719 --> 00:37:50,599
I'll see you off

657
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,559
Director Liang

658
00:37:59,519 --> 00:38:00,599
It's me, Chen Gengsheng

659
00:38:04,519 --> 00:38:05,320
Who is it?

660
00:38:06,039 --> 00:38:07,079
I know you're home

661
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:08,559
Open the door

662
00:38:14,679 --> 00:38:15,480
Draw the curtains

663
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:16,159
Get under the covers

664
00:38:16,159 --> 00:38:17,119
Take off your clothes

665
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:18,960
What are you talking about?

666
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,440
He's right at the door now

667
00:38:20,599 --> 00:38:21,599
You can't escape either

668
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,880
Believe it or not

669
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Go watch the back door

670
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,480
Keep a close eye for me

671
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:04,920
Chief Chen

672
00:39:05,239 --> 00:39:06,239
What a rare visitor.

673
00:39:06,239 --> 00:39:08,119
I didn't see you at headquarters today.

674
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,480
Are you here to check if I'm still alive?

675
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,599
Director Liang, what are you saying?

676
00:39:15,159 --> 00:39:17,000
Should I invite you in to sit for a while?

677
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,639
I don't think we're that close yet

678
00:39:18,639 --> 00:39:20,239
to just drop by each other's place.

679
00:39:24,559 --> 00:39:26,239
After all, we are colleagues.

680
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,840
Given Director Liang's character,

681
00:39:28,159 --> 00:39:29,599
and since I brought a small gift,

682
00:39:29,679 --> 00:39:31,840
it wouldn't be right not to invite me in.

683
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,559
I brought you two boxes of Longjing tea

684
00:39:38,559 --> 00:39:39,559
and two bottles of whisky.

685
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:40,840
Black & White brand.

686
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:41,880
Where should I put them for you?

687
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,519
Just put them on the table.

688
00:39:44,199 --> 00:39:45,440
Or maybe in the study?

689
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,800
So it's convenient for you to use.

690
00:39:49,199 --> 00:39:50,400
Director Liang, now that you've recovered,

691
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:51,840
I didn't get a chance

692
00:39:52,119 --> 00:39:53,280
to come by and congratulate you.

693
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:56,360
And with the Yulongshan incident before,

694
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,480
I'm truly sorry.

695
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,280
So I thought I'd make it up to you all at once.

696
00:40:02,599 --> 00:40:04,199
Chief Chen, you're too polite.

697
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,360
Please, you should go.

698
00:40:05,519 --> 00:40:07,880
Director Liang is still holding a grudge.

699
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,000
I'm really sorry.

700
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,800
It's all because the Japanese were pressing us too hard.

701
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,199
Of course,

702
00:40:14,199 --> 00:40:15,639
it was also the Director's decision.

703
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,360
Otherwise, how would I have dared?

704
00:40:18,239 --> 00:40:19,280
Director Liang

705
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,159
This phonograph is quite nice.

706
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:26,920
Where did you buy it?

707
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:31,800
Was it expensive?

708
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,239
Team Leader Chen,

709
00:40:34,039 --> 00:40:35,079
we've finished talking,

710
00:40:35,079 --> 00:40:36,159
and the gift has been given.

711
00:40:36,159 --> 00:40:37,159
Can I leave now?

712
00:40:37,159 --> 00:40:38,599
You're in such a hurry to kick me out.

713
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,239
Do you still have guests at home who haven't left?

714
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,239
Chen Gengsheng,

715
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,559
are you spying on me?

716
00:40:48,559 --> 00:40:49,840
Since we're all friends,

717
00:40:50,639 --> 00:40:52,519
let's have some tea together.

718
00:40:55,239 --> 00:40:56,280
Get out.

719
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:58,920
Sorry.

720
00:41:01,679 --> 00:41:04,199
So Team Leader Chen has this kind of hobby.

721
00:41:04,239 --> 00:41:06,199
I should call headquarters and ask

722
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,719
who exactly gave the order

723
00:41:07,719 --> 00:41:09,719
to investigate right up to my bed.

724
00:41:09,719 --> 00:41:10,440
Director Liang,

725
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,000
sorry.

726
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,719
I—I was being reckless.

727
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:15,559
I'll leave right away.

728
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,920
Sorry, sorry.

729
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:32,880
He's gone.

730
00:41:36,159 --> 00:41:36,840
How did it go?

731
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:37,920
Did we fool him?

732
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:40,199
Thank you.

733
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:42,119
It's a bit early to thank me now.

734
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:44,280
Wait until I give you your freedom back to thank me.

735
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:45,239
I'll go now.
