1
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,039
This Nakayama Kazuo

2
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:19,759
could possibly be

3
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:22,240
the hidden identity of Asai Hisashi?

4
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,639
Where is he?

5
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:18,159
Hurry up and leave.

6
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:23,319
Bastard.

7
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:24,319
Sorry.

8
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:25,599
Stay here.

9
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:26,520
Don't leave.

10
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,319
Yes.

11
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:39,599
Sir.

12
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:40,360
Excuse me.

13
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,360
I'm done for the day.

14
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,719
The list in the safe is fake.

15
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:53,560
This is just a trap set by Mizuno Shingen.

16
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,479
You need to leave quickly.

17
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:55,240
What about you?

18
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,039
If I leave, I'll look suspicious.

19
00:03:58,039 --> 00:03:58,960
Don't worry about me.

20
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:00,439
Go now.

21
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,360
Block off the street.

22
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,040
Yes, yes.

23
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:18,879
Qi Xiuquan.

24
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:19,800
Director.

25
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,759
Hurry, go tell Old Yu.

26
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:21,360
Tell him to be careful.

27
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,680
And also, find Director Liang immediately.

28
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,240
Yes, yes.

29
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,160
Move aside.

30
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:25,879
Move aside.

31
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,240
You, stop!

32
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:29,920
Catch her!

33
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,639
Stop!

34
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:31,879
Move! Move!

35
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:32,399
Stop!

36
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:32,800
Get out of the way!

37
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,560
Stop!

38
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:35,759
Stop!

39
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:40,600
Cover!

40
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,199
Yes.

41
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,439
Retreat quickly!

42
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,600
Retreat quickly!

43
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:54,800
What are you standing there for?

44
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,560
Chase them!

45
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,439
Stop! Stop!

46
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,759
Stop!

47
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:01,600
Report to headquarters.

48
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,439
Send reinforcements.

49
00:05:02,439 --> 00:05:03,279
Yes.

50
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:26,839
Sir.

51
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:28,040
Where is your chief?

52
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,920
He went to arrest anti-Japanese agents.

53
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,279
Which direction?

54
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,000
That way.

55
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:48,560
Split up!

56
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,040
Okay.

57
00:05:55,079 --> 00:05:55,959
Surround them!

58
00:05:57,639 --> 00:05:58,360
Over there!

59
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:04,600
Hurry, chase them!

60
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:05,639
Yes.

61
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,240
Hurry up!

62
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:29,879
Run! Hurry up!

63
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:30,839
Over there!

64
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:36,759
Chase them!

65
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:37,560
Yes, yes!

66
00:06:56,199 --> 00:06:57,040
Move quickly!

67
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,079
Hurry!

68
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,000
Go!

69
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,360
Get out of the way!

70
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:11,519
Pursue them separately!

71
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:12,360
Yes, yes!

72
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:25,399
Take them away.

73
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:27,519
Let's go.

74
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,319
Look at their weapons and equipment.

75
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,319
They must be Communist underground members.

76
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,720
I thought the Communists were something special.

77
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:38,360
But they're nothing much.

78
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,759
Shanghai is our territory now.

79
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,040
Our current task

80
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:46,079
is just to clean up the remaining stragglers.

81
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:47,519
Mr. Takagi is right.

82
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,360
Why hasn't Director Liang come over?

83
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:54,879
Mr. Zhongshan's important belongings

84
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:55,959
are still in the room.

85
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,079
It's his duty.

86
00:07:57,079 --> 00:07:58,079
He can't leave.

87
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,480
He is quite dedicated to his duty.

88
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,560
I heard it's the underground party causing trouble.

89
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,160
That's right.

90
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,079
And it's a female underground member.

91
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:20,120
Have you seen her?

92
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:22,079
Hurry up and go.

93
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,000
We've caught the person.

94
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:28,920
Well done.

95
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:30,759
At least I can hold my head up this time.

96
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,480
It's been a long time.

97
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,759
Miss Jiang.

98
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,360
Take her back.

99
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:52,600
I'll put in a good word for you later.

100
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:54,080
Take her away.

101
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,080
Can I have a cigarette?

102
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:10,120
We've been at this for a while, everyone's tired.

103
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:10,919
Let's wrap it up.

104
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,080
I know what you're thinking right now.

105
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:21,879
I really didn't expect this.

106
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:24,919
As things stand,

107
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,639
she was deliberately getting close to you.

108
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:28,320
Her identity is confirmed now.

109
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,960
You won't let old feelings get in the way, will you?

110
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:37,159
She's already caused a huge mess.

111
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:39,120
What else can I do?

112
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:23,960
Senior Asai, long time no see.

113
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,200
Sorry to trouble you, Mizuno.

114
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,240
You even came all this way to pick up a prisoner like me.

115
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,200
Thank you for the courtesy.

116
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:32,840
Thank you.

117
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,200
Please get in the car first.

118
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:58,519
Brother Hai.

119
00:10:58,519 --> 00:10:59,240
It's not outside.

120
00:10:59,240 --> 00:10:59,919
Go look inside.

121
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:00,559
Okay.

122
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,200
Cigarettes, lighter.

123
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,159
Selling cigarettes.

124
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,399
Brother Hai

125
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:38,559
Look, what is this?

126
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:39,200
Let me see.

127
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:42,039
Let's go.

128
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:45,600
Come.

129
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,799
Any documents related to the organization

130
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:47,399
must be burned.

131
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:48,039
Okay.

132
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:53,600
This is the place.

133
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,240
The director has given orders.

134
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,279
Search for all materials related to the female Communist Party.

135
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,759
Yes, yes.

136
00:11:58,919 --> 00:11:59,840
Sir, sir!

137
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:00,759
Move aside.

138
00:12:00,919 --> 00:12:01,799
Move aside.

139
00:12:06,039 --> 00:12:06,919
Spread out and search.

140
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:07,799
Search carefully.

141
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:08,679
Yes, yes.

142
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,039
Let's go.

143
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,480
Brother Hai

144
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,480
Brother Hai

145
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:14,600
Brother Hai

146
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:16,320
Brother Hai

147
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:17,440
Something's happened!

148
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:19,240
A lot of people from No. 76 have arrived outside.

149
00:12:19,879 --> 00:12:20,559
Stop tidying up.

150
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:21,080
Evacuate quickly!

151
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:21,399
Okay.

152
00:12:21,399 --> 00:12:21,799
Hurry!

153
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:25,600
Hurry!

154
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:38,639
You guys,

155
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:39,519
go search the rooms.

156
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:40,080
Yes.

157
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:40,679
Follow me.

158
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,480
Stop him.

159
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:52,919
Stop him.

160
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,440
Stop him.

161
00:12:54,519 --> 00:12:55,399
Go, go.

162
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:56,320
Hurry up.

163
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:56,919
Go.

164
00:12:56,919 --> 00:12:57,440
Go, go.

165
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,480
Stop him.

166
00:12:58,799 --> 00:12:59,279
Follow.

167
00:12:59,279 --> 00:12:59,840
Quick.

168
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,159
Director.

169
00:13:06,759 --> 00:13:08,360
A report from Cui Mo.

170
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:10,639
During the operation,

171
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,519
two underground members were shot dead.

172
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,960
And a female underground member was captured alive.

173
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:18,960
That's good news.

174
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,080
I have to give Old Cui

175
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,399
credit for this.

176
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,639
Where's the person they caught?

177
00:13:24,919 --> 00:13:26,840
Already taken to the interrogation room.

178
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:27,960
We questioned her.

179
00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:29,480
She's very tight-lipped.

180
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,399
Have you ever seen an easy-to-handle Communist?

181
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:33,960
Let's go.

182
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:35,399
Let's go take a look.

183
00:13:36,759 --> 00:13:37,559
Director.

184
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:40,399
Chief Cui has another message for you.

185
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:42,480
This underground member

186
00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:45,919
is Liang Shuo's old flame.

187
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:47,960
Director, do you think

188
00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:51,120
the news of Nakayama Kazuo appearing in Shanghai

189
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,360
is top secret.

190
00:13:52,759 --> 00:13:55,480
How did this underground member find out?

191
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,399
You

192
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:03,720
suspect Liang Shuo?

193
00:14:04,039 --> 00:14:05,679
I'm just concerned.

194
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,399
Then call Director Liang

195
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:13,519
to go meet

196
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,279
his old acquaintance together.

197
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,240
Yes.

198
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:26,879
Jiang Feiman

199
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,799
I really didn't expect this.

200
00:14:30,919 --> 00:14:32,919
A talented woman from Pingchuan Academy,

201
00:14:33,559 --> 00:14:34,679
young and beautiful,

202
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:35,799
with a bright future ahead,

203
00:14:36,679 --> 00:14:39,639
why would you get involved in this mess?

204
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:41,679
You—

205
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,279
what are you really after?

206
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,120
They say you can't take money to the grave.

207
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,480
But money

208
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,320
can send people to the grave.

209
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:54,159
What you're doing now could cost you your life.

210
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,559
How much does your party owe you in salary for this?

211
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:03,279
Belief is not the same as a job.

212
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:06,159
If it were for money,

213
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,320
there'd be no need for revolution.

214
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,360
People like you

215
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:12,039
would never understand.

216
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,000
Miss Jiang,

217
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:16,039
I'm just very curious.

218
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:18,159
The information about Zhongshan Yinan—

219
00:15:18,519 --> 00:15:19,879
where did you get it from?

220
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:24,519
Or

221
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,279
was there someone

222
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:27,799
who leaked it to you?

223
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:34,240
Miss Jiang

224
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,639
Let me give you some advice.

225
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,399
You should think about

226
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:38,639
your family and friends.

227
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:41,120
In this world,

228
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,360
there are three kinds of people

229
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,200
who matter most.

230
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:44,799
Those who gave birth to you,

231
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,000
those you gave birth to,

232
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:47,320
and also

233
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,600
the friends around you.

234
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,279
Of course,

235
00:15:50,759 --> 00:15:52,200
we've already investigated.

236
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,399
Miss Jiang has no relatives in Shanghai.

237
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:57,960
But many people at Pingchuan Academy

238
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,440
are your friends.

239
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,480
You wouldn't want them

240
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:02,799
because of you

241
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,000
to get implicated, would you?

242
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,440
You're shameless.

243
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:09,000
Miss Jiang,

244
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,240
you're a smart person.

245
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:11,519
You should know

246
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,679
the consequences of stubborn resistance.

247
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:15,840
Of course, you can sacrifice yourself

248
00:16:15,879 --> 00:16:17,039
for your beliefs.

249
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,200
But the people around you are innocent.

250
00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:20,919
Can you bear to drag them down with you?

251
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:30,559
So,

252
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:32,679
as long as I reveal the source of the information, that's enough?

253
00:16:32,679 --> 00:16:33,399
Of course.

254
00:16:36,679 --> 00:16:38,159
The one who leaked the information to me

255
00:16:40,039 --> 00:16:41,720
was from your Special Investigation Department,

256
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,360
the Deputy Director,

257
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,080
Liang Shuo.

258
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,279
As for Nakayama Kazuo's itinerary,

259
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,080
he was the one who leaked it to me.

260
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,440
Deputy Director Liang promised me

261
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,159
he would let me go after it was done.

262
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,480
But he went back on his word.

263
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,680
Miss Jiang

264
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,720
Back then, we parted on good terms.

265
00:17:20,519 --> 00:17:21,400
I’m not sure either.

266
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,680
When did you join the Communist Party?

267
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,680
But to frame me at a time like this,

268
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,160
isn’t that a bit too heartless?

269
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,279
I must have been blind back then.

270
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:36,599
Director

271
00:17:37,519 --> 00:17:38,880
May I ask her a question?

272
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,039
Alright.

273
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,200
Go ahead.

274
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,519
May I ask,

275
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:47,480
when did I supposedly tell you?

276
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,119
Yesterday at noon.

277
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:51,839
Yesterday at noon.

278
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:54,359
Director Liang was in a meeting in the Director’s office.

279
00:17:54,359 --> 00:17:55,960
How could he have passed you any information?

280
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,440
He wasn’t the one who passed the message.

281
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,319
It was you, Cui.

282
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,160
You were the one who gave me the message.

283
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,759
Don’t talk nonsense!

284
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,039
I was in a meeting too!

285
00:18:08,279 --> 00:18:09,000
Jiang Feiman

286
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:10,319
I’ve barely even met you a few times.

287
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:11,079
We have no grudges between us.

288
00:18:11,079 --> 00:18:12,039
Stop trying to drag me into this.

289
00:18:12,039 --> 00:18:12,759
Enough.

290
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:15,359
Miss Jiang

291
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,319
You’re making wild accusations and using others to do your dirty work.

292
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,200
Does it mean anything?

293
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,400
Just make it quick.

294
00:18:23,319 --> 00:18:25,000
I never thought I’d make it out alive.

295
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,480
Quick and painless?

296
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,759
It’s been a long time since I’ve heard such a naive word.

297
00:18:32,039 --> 00:18:32,640
Fine.

298
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,440
If you’re willing to die,

299
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,440
then I’m willing to bury you.

300
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,319
I’ll grant your wish.

301
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:42,240
The Communist Party

302
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,319
are all tough nuts.

303
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,240
This woman is the same.

304
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,400
Pay more attention.

305
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:49,240
Yes.

306
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,000
Jiang Feiman.

307
00:18:56,519 --> 00:18:58,359
The person who could talk to you nicely is gone.

308
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,720
I hope you won't regret it.

309
00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:09,640
I know you Communists

310
00:19:10,039 --> 00:19:11,160
are all very persistent.

311
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:13,720
But I am also very patient.

312
00:19:14,759 --> 00:19:16,079
Death is actually not that scary.

313
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,599
Do you know what it means

314
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,319
to wish you were dead?

315
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,359
Do it.

316
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:24,839
Yes.

317
00:19:24,839 --> 00:19:25,319
Yes.

318
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,559
She is so heartless to you.

319
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:31,200
Why do you bother?

320
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:33,319
I don't want to do this either.

321
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:36,759
But someone has to do the dirty and tiring work.

322
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,200
Brother Cui,

323
00:19:40,039 --> 00:19:41,720
you understand how I feel right now.

324
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:43,680
I'm going out for some air.

325
00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:50,559
Liang Shuo.

326
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,200
You betrayed your country

327
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,319
and harmed your own people.

328
00:19:53,319 --> 00:19:55,000
One day, you'll die a miserable death.

329
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:00,960
Are you going to talk or not?

330
00:20:12,759 --> 00:20:13,559
I'll talk.

331
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,519
Got it.

332
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:34,960
It seems there's no point in keeping intelligence secret.

333
00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:36,440
I just released

334
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:39,160
the news about Mr. Sun Yat-sen's arrival in Shanghai.

335
00:20:39,559 --> 00:20:42,160
And the Communists took the bait right away.

336
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,039
Wang Mutian's betrayal

337
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:51,039
has made all the anti-Japanese elements feel threatened.

338
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,759
Their ranks are in chaos.

339
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,799
The 3-1 list has become our key to victory.

340
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,559
Senior Asai's contribution is indispensable.

341
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,680
Senior, codename Black Fox

342
00:21:03,799 --> 00:21:05,079
I heard that as early as twenty years ago

343
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,079
you were already known as the "Eagle of Far East Intelligence."

344
00:21:07,079 --> 00:21:10,400
To have your assistance this time

345
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,680
is a great honor for me.

346
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:15,319
The honor is mine as well.

347
00:21:15,319 --> 00:21:16,880
To meet someone

348
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,119
who knows China as well as I do

349
00:21:20,119 --> 00:21:23,000
is truly rare.

350
00:21:24,079 --> 00:21:27,119
To find a kindred spirit—my life is complete.

351
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:29,599
Senior Asai, please enjoy some tea.

352
00:21:30,319 --> 00:21:31,400
Thank you.

353
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,240
Mizuno

354
00:21:37,119 --> 00:21:40,599
Based on what you know so far,

355
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:42,160
how do you think the war situation in China will develop?

356
00:21:42,359 --> 00:21:46,799
General Okamura's military operations are somewhat slow.

357
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:50,279
It will take longer to annex China.

358
00:21:51,119 --> 00:21:53,759
It's not that China is hard to annex,

359
00:21:54,039 --> 00:21:55,920
but that it cannot be annexed at all.

360
00:21:56,079 --> 00:21:59,200
If Japan continues its military expansion now,

361
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,720
I think the resources needed

362
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,119
simply cannot be sufficiently supplied.

363
00:22:03,759 --> 00:22:06,079
Those fools in the current cabinet

364
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,200
still haven't realized this.

365
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,759
War is a contest of

366
00:22:09,759 --> 00:22:13,000
the two countries' overall industrial strength.

367
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,519
If we can use the power of this list,

368
00:22:15,519 --> 00:22:18,799
we can not only undermine the Nanjing government from within,

369
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:21,559
but the Communists will also have nowhere to hide.

370
00:22:22,279 --> 00:22:23,759
Mizuno

371
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:27,519
You haven't clearly explained the true significance of this list.

372
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:31,359
For a China currently in a state of division,

373
00:22:31,359 --> 00:22:34,480
time is a deadly poison.

374
00:22:51,519 --> 00:22:52,960
She’s your old flame.

375
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:56,880
What are you trying to do?

376
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,240
What else can I do?

377
00:22:59,799 --> 00:23:01,000
If we don’t take advantage of the interrogation,

378
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:01,599
and kill her,

379
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,640
are we just going to wait for trouble to come to us?

380
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,039
What are you thinking?

381
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,279
She just bit me in front of everyone.

382
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,519
If you kill her now,

383
00:23:08,519 --> 00:23:09,880
who do you think the director will suspect first?

384
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:12,759
You wouldn’t—

385
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,759
Are you still hung up on your past with her?

386
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,960
She doesn’t even know I’m with the military intelligence.

387
00:23:19,359 --> 00:23:21,240
Why would I kill her and expose myself?

388
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,519
Now we have complete control over

389
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:28,839
the Manchukuo government and the Nanjing government.

390
00:23:28,839 --> 00:23:30,000
With this as an opportunity,

391
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,440
why not use the list

392
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:35,160
to establish another autonomous region?

393
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,559
If this new autonomous region

394
00:23:37,559 --> 00:23:40,039
is loyal to the Empire of Japan,

395
00:23:40,359 --> 00:23:43,759
wouldn’t we have enough resources?

396
00:23:43,759 --> 00:23:46,279
To make up for the losses of war?

397
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:49,960
Once the beast regains its strength,

398
00:23:50,319 --> 00:23:53,839
swallowing the mere Chongqing government

399
00:23:53,839 --> 00:23:56,200
won't be much of a challenge.

400
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,680
Senior Asai,

401
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,160
with such lofty ambitions,

402
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,119
why not explain them to the cabinet?

403
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,559
Mizuno,

404
00:24:05,559 --> 00:24:08,720
you really don't understand politics at all.

405
00:24:09,799 --> 00:24:11,640
The current cabinet

406
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,880
has long been controlled by the military.

407
00:24:15,519 --> 00:24:18,000
Those fanatical, foolish generals

408
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,279
only care about their own military achievements.

409
00:24:21,559 --> 00:24:24,440
They turn a deaf ear to any other opinions.

410
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:27,240
Senior Asai,

411
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,160
it seems that before you came,

412
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,039
you had already thought everything through.

413
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:31,759
You want me

414
00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:33,200
to help you keep this from the military, is that it?

415
00:24:33,799 --> 00:24:35,440
That's right.

416
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:38,799
If we can join forces,

417
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:40,799
we will surely reap great rewards.

418
00:24:47,839 --> 00:24:50,279
As for this important matter,

419
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,640
please allow me some time to think it over.

420
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:55,759
But right now,

421
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,039
I'd like to see your sincerity, Senior Asai.

422
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,359
I thought I had already

423
00:25:01,359 --> 00:25:03,039
shown enough sincerity.

424
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:09,960
I don't like greedy people.

425
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,119
But there is one thing

426
00:25:15,119 --> 00:25:16,200
you should be concerned about.

427
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:18,960
Kazuo Nakayama didn't bring the list at all.

428
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,079
His safe was full of blank paper.

429
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,720
Impossible.

430
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,279
Do you really want to get the list?

431
00:25:25,319 --> 00:25:26,119
What do you think?

432
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,519
Then focus your efforts on Shingen Mizuno.

433
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,480
He's the one the Special Operations Headquarters just caught.

434
00:25:39,759 --> 00:25:41,440
Don't you report there every week?

435
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,759
Ask about the list while you're at it.

436
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:51,640
Didn't I already

437
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,960
warn you before?

438
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,799
This Asai Hisashi

439
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:57,279
is not a man who can be easily controlled.

440
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:00,039
He lives by his own theories.

441
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,519
He'll throw off your own rhythm.

442
00:26:04,759 --> 00:26:05,880
Without stepping into the abyss,

443
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,680
how can you find the dragon's child?

444
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:10,880
I have my own understanding.

445
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,640
If this list really exists,

446
00:26:16,759 --> 00:26:17,599
why would Asai Hisashi

447
00:26:17,599 --> 00:26:20,240
insist on waiting until the day of the peace conference

448
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,359
to reveal it?

449
00:26:21,519 --> 00:26:22,319
He's waiting for him.

450
00:26:26,359 --> 00:26:27,839
It's General Doihara, isn't it?

451
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:29,960
No wonder.

452
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,319
This Asai Hisashi

453
00:26:31,319 --> 00:26:33,119
really played a clever move.

454
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,000
He's a pure idealist.

455
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,279
Whenever he has an idea, he puts it into action.

456
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,440
He's my favorite senior.

457
00:26:42,079 --> 00:26:42,880
As expected.

458
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:46,000
Mizuno, you can be honest like this too.

459
00:26:46,759 --> 00:26:47,480
What do you mean?

460
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:48,799
He knows very well

461
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:52,160
that he has to rely on General Doihara.

462
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,119
What about you?

463
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,319
I heard

464
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:59,079
that you specifically at the Aoyama shelter

465
00:26:59,079 --> 00:27:01,519
secretly supervised those laborers

466
00:27:01,839 --> 00:27:02,759
just to

467
00:27:02,759 --> 00:27:03,680
offer them to General Doihara

468
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,319
as a gift, right?

469
00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:06,880
A gift?

470
00:27:07,839 --> 00:27:09,359
Why do you think that?

471
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,559
What's wrong with that?

472
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,680
Mr. Takagi,

473
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:21,200
thank you for your concern.

474
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:25,640
Don't let your emotions get in the way.

475
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:28,559
To achieve our goals,

476
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,640
there are only two methods:

477
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:33,519
soft or hard.

478
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:36,279
But I've always believed

479
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:39,480
that the cooperation between Mizuno and Mr. Asai

480
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,160
can succeed.

481
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,079
Because

482
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:45,640
you're better than me at

483
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,039
opening doors.

484
00:27:58,119 --> 00:27:58,920
Director Liang

485
00:27:59,119 --> 00:28:00,400
The interrogation produced results.

486
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,240
There's not a single patch of uninjured skin on her.

487
00:28:03,359 --> 00:28:04,319
She fainted three or four times.

488
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:05,200
But she still refuses to confess.

489
00:28:06,599 --> 00:28:07,400
We're still interrogating her.

490
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:09,680
That's all.

491
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,480
We're worried she can't take it.

492
00:28:11,559 --> 00:28:12,680
Afraid she might be beaten to death.

493
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,160
We're having someone watch her.

494
00:28:16,039 --> 00:28:16,680
Got it.

495
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,240
Go ahead.

496
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:18,160
Yes.

497
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:04,759
Please.

498
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:23,839
This is

499
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:26,440
Mr. Mizuno's intention?

500
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,559
Mr. Asai.

501
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,440
Isn't it obvious?

502
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
What a pity.

503
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:35,559
I thought I could help.

504
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,200
Your ideals are too ambitious.

505
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,079
But unfortunately,

506
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,359
on the front lines,

507
00:29:42,359 --> 00:29:43,960
we don't have much time left.

508
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:46,079
What Mr. Mizuno means is

509
00:29:46,079 --> 00:29:48,119
to first reverse the decline,

510
00:29:48,279 --> 00:29:50,319
then proceed gradually.

511
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,720
When looking at an issue,

512
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,400
if the perspective is different,

513
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,759
the guiding principles will also differ.

514
00:29:58,319 --> 00:30:00,599
I'd like to know,

515
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:05,160
if we disagree,

516
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,759
what will happen?

517
00:30:07,759 --> 00:30:11,079
Now, it's my turn to persuade you.

518
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:13,720
If I can't succeed,

519
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,799
I'll have to try another way.

520
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,079
Do you understand?

521
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:24,680
Not bad.

522
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:26,400
After all, it was I myself

523
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,200
who chose this partner.

524
00:30:30,519 --> 00:30:32,839
Then please tell Mizuno,

525
00:30:32,839 --> 00:30:35,480
I'll give him this list.

526
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:36,519
But

527
00:30:36,519 --> 00:30:38,000
there are conditions.

528
00:30:38,759 --> 00:30:42,480
I want to talk to Mizuno directly.

529
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:49,160
Mr. Asai is very wise.

530
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:52,839
He avoided unnecessary suffering.

531
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:04,640
Director Liang.

532
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:11,759
Director Liang.

533
00:31:12,839 --> 00:31:13,519
Director Liang.

534
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,640
Our boss has instructed

535
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,000
that no one with the surname Jiang from the Communist Party

536
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,200
is allowed any visits.

537
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,720
When did I say I wanted to see Jiang Feiman?

538
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:22,960
The one from Dafengtang that Chief Cui arrested earlier.

539
00:31:23,119 --> 00:31:24,680
Take him to the interrogation room next door.

540
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,720
I want to question him.

541
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,400
Yes.

542
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:28,160
He's being held in the basement cell.

543
00:31:28,279 --> 00:31:29,200
I'll go get him right away.

544
00:31:42,599 --> 00:31:43,720
Feiman.

545
00:31:44,039 --> 00:31:44,759
Feiman.

546
00:31:45,119 --> 00:31:46,200
Feiman, wake up.

547
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,799
Why are you here?

548
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:57,799
I'm sorry.

549
00:31:58,559 --> 00:31:59,759
I've made you suffer.

550
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,920
You really don't understand women.

551
00:32:08,759 --> 00:32:10,119
You shouldn't have come.

552
00:32:12,079 --> 00:32:13,720
I'd rather die.

553
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,519
Than let you see me like this.

554
00:32:16,839 --> 00:32:18,480
In this state.

555
00:32:20,359 --> 00:32:21,759
I won't give up on you.

556
00:32:22,359 --> 00:32:23,519
You have to trust me.

557
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:26,599
Where is this place?

558
00:32:27,599 --> 00:32:29,720
I'm already prepared.

559
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:31,839
Let's go.

560
00:32:32,759 --> 00:32:34,319
If they get suspicious,

561
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,039
then I...

562
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:38,880
all this suffering would be for nothing.

563
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,200
If I really tried to avoid suspicion,

564
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:42,960
that's when they'd actually get suspicious.

565
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,440
Old Tan.

566
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:48,519
And everything that comes after.

567
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:50,720
I'm counting on you.

568
00:32:52,319 --> 00:32:53,839
It's not over yet.

569
00:32:56,279 --> 00:32:58,359
Meeting you so many times.

570
00:32:59,079 --> 00:33:00,599
And this is the only time.

571
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:02,400
I feel

572
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,440
that you are truly by my side.

573
00:33:09,559 --> 00:33:11,240
Many times,

574
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,359
I keep thinking

575
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,480
even if we walk side by side,

576
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,359
in the end, we will

577
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,119
each

578
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,440
walk our own path alone.

579
00:33:26,519 --> 00:33:27,480
There's no time left.

580
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:28,880
Listen to me.

581
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,480
I have a plan.

582
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,119
You need to find a way to reveal

583
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,240
that you are very familiar with the Trinity Plan

584
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,119
and the list.

585
00:33:35,319 --> 00:33:37,039
Li Hanzhi will value you greatly.

586
00:33:37,359 --> 00:33:38,880
He will send you to Nanjing.

587
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:40,440
As long as he sends you out,

588
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,079
I will have a way to save you.

589
00:33:42,279 --> 00:33:43,480
Do you understand?

590
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,000
Why do you

591
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:48,480
refuse to accept your fate?

592
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,279
Maple Leaf has already died because of me.

593
00:33:50,599 --> 00:33:52,640
I can't let Maple Leaf die because of me again.

594
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,279
You have to trust me.

595
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:27,960
I heard

596
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:31,199
Senior Asai was born in Honshu

597
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:33,760
This sake

598
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:36,440
is from Kobe

599
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:38,559
I thought Senior Asai might like it

600
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:43,039
These days

601
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:45,239
Kobe doesn't produce good sake anymore

602
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:46,960
Now

603
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,880
everyone just makes fakes

604
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,400
Sake is like people

605
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,400
No matter what happens

606
00:34:55,519 --> 00:34:59,079
it always keeps the flavor of its hometown

607
00:35:01,039 --> 00:35:02,400
Yeah

608
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,880
That's true

609
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,079
Mr. Asai

610
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:22,599
You've been reluctant to give me the list

611
00:35:22,599 --> 00:35:23,760
Is there something you're worried about?

612
00:35:25,639 --> 00:35:26,599
Mr. Mizuno

613
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:27,800
I was wrong

614
00:35:28,519 --> 00:35:29,760
I'm confident

615
00:35:30,239 --> 00:35:32,480
about the power of this list

616
00:35:32,719 --> 00:35:34,599
You know that

617
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,199
This list

618
00:35:37,199 --> 00:35:38,960
has been completed for over ten years now

619
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:41,039
I don't think

620
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,920
it still has that kind of effectiveness

621
00:35:44,519 --> 00:35:45,519
Think about it

622
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:46,800
On the surface

623
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:48,639
it's just a simple list

624
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:49,760
But in reality

625
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:50,920
from the very beginning

626
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:54,039
an incredible amount of effort was poured into it

627
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:56,639
For this reason,

628
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:00,679
I set up a dedicated intelligence network

629
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:03,519
to gather information on the people on the list,

630
00:36:03,519 --> 00:36:05,159
including their backgrounds and developments,

631
00:36:05,159 --> 00:36:07,519
their preferences, weaknesses, and so on,

632
00:36:07,679 --> 00:36:10,880
all sorts of data.

633
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:14,119
Everyone on the list

634
00:36:14,119 --> 00:36:15,920
has a real weakness

635
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,639
that we've managed to collect.

636
00:36:17,719 --> 00:36:20,400
Whether it's a disgraceful political career,

637
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:22,639
large-scale embezzlement,

638
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:24,960
plotting against colleagues,

639
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,440
or selling national secrets,

640
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:27,599
the list goes on.

641
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:30,239
With this foundation,

642
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,119
and through careful planning,

643
00:36:32,119 --> 00:36:34,159
we coerced the people on the list

644
00:36:34,159 --> 00:36:38,840
to leave behind recordings, agreements,

645
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:41,639
signatures, fingerprints, and other evidence.

646
00:36:42,039 --> 00:36:44,360
If, when the time comes to activate them,

647
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:46,000
they have second thoughts,

648
00:36:46,039 --> 00:36:49,280
I can destroy them at any time.

649
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:51,960
There is only one copy of this list.

650
00:36:52,679 --> 00:36:55,760
Mr. Asai, is the one you have the original?

651
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,079
As you said,

652
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:01,519
I understand Mizuno's impatience.

653
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,760
There's a Chinese saying: "Haste makes waste."

654
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,079
If you try to get it quickly,

655
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:07,679
you may end up with nothing.

656
00:37:08,119 --> 00:37:09,800
Our cooperation

657
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:12,840
will end at any time if you don't do as I say.

658
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,480
I can terminate our cooperation at any moment.

659
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,400
Additionally,

660
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,920
if this information leaks out,

661
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:20,199
other forces besides Mizuno

662
00:37:20,199 --> 00:37:21,679
will all want it, won't they?

663
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:25,320
I believe we've achieved our goal.

664
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,760
Didn't I say

665
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,960
that I have conditions?

666
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:36,960
Lu Xijian has arrived.

667
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,440
He wants to see the chief.

668
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:39,880
Wait for me outside.

669
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:40,320
Yes, sir.

670
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,360
Senior Asai.

671
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,679
My patience has its limits.

672
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:54,000
I hope you will reconsider.

673
00:37:59,119 --> 00:37:59,920
Mr. Lu.

674
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:03,840
Unit 76 has arrested a Communist suspect.

675
00:38:05,559 --> 00:38:07,360
It was Director Liang from the Operations Department and the Military Police.

676
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,599
They acted together.

677
00:38:09,519 --> 00:38:10,239
This time,

678
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:11,800
their target

679
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:14,199
was Nakayama Kazuo, who was under the protection of the Military Police.

680
00:38:14,639 --> 00:38:16,800
And the underground member who was arrested

681
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,440
is also known to Mr. Mizuno.

682
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,199
Who is it?

683
00:38:21,719 --> 00:38:23,599
The owner of Hirakawa Academy.

684
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:24,480
Jiang Feiman.

685
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,800
Jiang Feiman.

686
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,039
So it was her.

687
00:38:31,159 --> 00:38:33,440
I used to greatly admire her talent.

688
00:38:33,639 --> 00:38:35,199
I hoped to use her influence

689
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,639
to promote Sino-Japanese friendship.

690
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,239
I never expected her to be a Communist.

691
00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:44,440
I've already told you everything.

692
00:38:44,599 --> 00:38:45,440
The only thing to consider

693
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,800
is that Mizuno Shingen may not trust you right away.

694
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,440
But as long as you, during the conversation,

695
00:38:49,559 --> 00:38:51,400
hint a little about the list,

696
00:38:51,519 --> 00:38:52,639
then in this conversation,

697
00:38:52,639 --> 00:38:53,920
you'll be able to take the initiative.

698
00:38:54,519 --> 00:38:56,360
How much you reveal about the list

699
00:38:57,159 --> 00:38:58,639
just needs to be enough for him to get the idea.

700
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,320
As long as you can sow discord

701
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,320
between Mizuno Shingen and Li Hanzhi,

702
00:39:02,559 --> 00:39:03,639
then Mizuno Shingen

703
00:39:03,639 --> 00:39:05,400
won't trust No. 76 anymore.

704
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,039
As long as he can't sit still,

705
00:39:07,199 --> 00:39:08,239
and becomes restless,

706
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,519
keep an eye on his movements,

707
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:10,800
Asai Hisashi

708
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:11,920
and clues about the list

709
00:39:12,039 --> 00:39:13,239
will come to the surface.

710
00:39:14,039 --> 00:39:14,880
Mr. Lu,

711
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:18,280
what do you think about the Communist Party's operation this time?

712
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,239
Any thoughts?

713
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,880
Based on what we know so far,

714
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:25,079
they want to

715
00:39:25,559 --> 00:39:27,239
urgently get something from Nakayama Kazuo

716
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:29,239
— a very important piece of intelligence.

717
00:39:29,239 --> 00:39:29,280
A very important piece of intelligence.

718
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:30,719
What intelligence?

719
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:31,840
It's still unclear.

720
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:33,559
But No. 76's

721
00:39:34,199 --> 00:39:35,679
level of attention to this person

722
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,400
far exceeds that of anyone else.

723
00:39:40,719 --> 00:39:42,559
As for the Peace Conference,

724
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:43,760
how much does she know?

725
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:44,920
That's still unclear.

726
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,400
But based on my guess,

727
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,679
they should already have

728
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,480
confidential information about the Peace Conference.

729
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,159
Otherwise, they wouldn't act so rashly.

730
00:39:58,679 --> 00:40:02,559
Cigarettes! Cigarettes for sale!

731
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,280
Who told you not to call?

732
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:05,719
What's going on?

733
00:40:05,719 --> 00:40:06,519
Honey.

734
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:07,760
What are you doing?

735
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,199
I have something private to tell you.

736
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:10,960
What is it?

737
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:13,159
How many days have you been gone?

738
00:40:13,159 --> 00:40:13,960
You know that, right?

739
00:40:14,719 --> 00:40:16,039
Then let me tell you something private too.

740
00:40:16,039 --> 00:40:16,760
Alright?

741
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:17,519
Go ahead.

742
00:40:18,719 --> 00:40:19,519
Don't move.

743
00:40:21,159 --> 00:40:21,800
You're so annoying.

744
00:40:22,239 --> 00:40:23,239
You only made a few dishes?

745
00:40:24,159 --> 00:40:25,960
Why did you come here with him?

746
00:40:26,239 --> 00:40:27,480
You haven't been home for three days.

747
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,679
Did something happen?

748
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,719
Jiang Feiman was arrested.

749
00:40:32,159 --> 00:40:32,920
What?

750
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,679
Because of my previous relationship with Fei Man,

751
00:40:37,679 --> 00:40:38,559
I've been targeted.

752
00:40:38,559 --> 00:40:39,840
I can't act freely.

753
00:40:40,199 --> 00:40:41,400
So there are a few things

754
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,079
I'd like you to pass on to Old Tan.

755
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:44,639
Go ahead.

756
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,199
I will use Lu Xijian

757
00:40:46,199 --> 00:40:47,400
to sow discord between Mizuno Shingen

758
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,960
and Li Hanzhi.

759
00:40:49,199 --> 00:40:50,480
As long as their relationship falls apart,

760
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,480
we'll have a chance to rescue Fei Man.

761
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:55,440
Number 76

762
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,719
is a vassal of Meihua Hall.

763
00:40:58,199 --> 00:40:59,079
Li Hanzhi

764
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:00,960
is he willing to offend Mizuno?

765
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,280
They each have different forces behind them.

766
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:06,199
Even brothers may not be united,

767
00:41:06,599 --> 00:41:09,079
let alone people who never shared the same goals.

768
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,039
Although Number 76 appears to be a puppet on the surface,

769
00:41:12,039 --> 00:41:14,079
no one is truly willing to be a vassal.

770
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:16,320
Especially someone like Wang Jingwei.

771
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,559
As long as we grasp their master's intentions,

772
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:19,920
it won't be hard to figure out

773
00:41:20,199 --> 00:41:21,800
what their subordinates will do.

774
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:23,960
What about Sister Man?

775
00:41:24,199 --> 00:41:25,559
How is she doing now?

776
00:41:28,039 --> 00:41:28,840
Not very well.

777
00:41:29,559 --> 00:41:31,280
I don't know how much longer she can hold on.

778
00:41:31,679 --> 00:41:32,880
I'll make sure Li Hanzhi

779
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,480
and Mizuno Shingen are convinced

780
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,159
that Fei Man

781
00:41:36,159 --> 00:41:37,800
has the real information about the list.

782
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:39,519
All we can do is gamble

783
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:42,440
on how much Li Hanzhi values this information.
