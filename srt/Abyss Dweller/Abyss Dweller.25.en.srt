1
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:22,159
Sir,

2
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:24,039
You need to register here first.

3
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:25,639
Which doctor are you here to see?

4
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:27,800
Sir,

5
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,039
Which doctor exactly are you looking for?

6
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:31,919
I can register you right here.

7
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,000
You can't enter the pharmacy area; it's restricted.

8
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,919
You—

9
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:37,159
Please, go ahead.

10
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:31,280
Come with me.

11
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:36,319
He's serious this time.

12
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,840
I didn't expect him to chase us all the way here.

13
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,879
It seems

14
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,840
he's already started to suspect you.

15
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:47,759
The Shanghai station was destroyed.

16
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,159
They're on edge.

17
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:50,280
They don't trust anyone.

18
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,400
Now, inside No. 76,

19
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:54,439
besides being wary of Li Hanzhi,

20
00:03:54,439 --> 00:03:55,800
Cui Mo and Takagi,

21
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,840
now I have to watch out for Lu Xijian as well.

22
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:02,400
I know

23
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:03,719
the difficulties you're facing right now.

24
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,039
But I'm afraid

25
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:06,919
this situation

26
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,599
will continue for a while.

27
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,400
Lu Xijian's surveillance of me

28
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,960
will also become the norm.

29
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:19,319
You mean to say

30
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,279
we need to change our means of contact.

31
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:24,839
I just hope we can have another option.

32
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,040
With Fei Man as the intermediary,

33
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,639
our activities are somewhat restricted.

34
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,040
I hope we can let

35
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,079
Xie Nianci

36
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,800
serve as an emergency contact.

37
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:34,160
That would make it easier for us to communicate.

38
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:37,079
Within the organization,

39
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:38,600
the idea of bringing in Miss Xie

40
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,600
is approved.

41
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,120
But the vetting process still takes time.

42
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,439
Right now,

43
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,839
the situation in the struggle is extremely harsh.

44
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:46,959
Do you think

45
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:49,439
she can handle this task?

46
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:52,240
She must avoid arousing suspicion from Unit 76 as much as possible,

47
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,720
while also being someone close to Xie Jun'an.

48
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:55,759
Old Tan,

49
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,720
no one is more suitable than her.

50
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,920
Given the current situation,

51
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,800
that's indeed the case.

52
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,519
We should unite

53
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:06,839
all the forces we can.

54
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,199
But remember,

55
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:11,879
if you encounter an emergency,

56
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,319
you must adapt to the circumstances.

57
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:16,480
Did you come to see me today

58
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,600
just for this matter?

59
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,639
The impact of Wang Mutian's betrayal

60
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:27,240
has already spread to Nanjing.

61
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,040
Even the Nanjing side

62
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,639
is very wary of this list.

63
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,399
Tell me about it in detail.

64
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,519
Today, Li Hanzhi called me in for a talk.

65
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,399
From what he said,

66
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,120
he has already approached Mizuno Shingen about the list.

67
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,000
He found Mizuno Shingen,

68
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,399
but was turned down.

69
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:47,079
You mean

70
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:50,600
we can use this to our advantage?

71
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:51,360
That's right.

72
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,720
Since the Nanjing side is interested,

73
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,319
why don't we give them a little push?

74
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,120
Even if we can't make them fight each other,

75
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,079
we can at least gain

76
00:05:58,079 --> 00:05:59,399
another channel for gathering information.

77
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:00,879
Speaking of gathering information,

78
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,879
can you help me look into someone?

79
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:05,560
A Japanese man named Asai Hisashi.

80
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,279
According to the Nanjing side,

81
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,480
this person

82
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,399
might be the creator of the list.

83
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,160
Judging from the current situation of the war of resistance,

84
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,000
the importance of this list

85
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,839
may be unprecedented.

86
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,519
We should

87
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:22,920
focus our efforts

88
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,439
on this matter.

89
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,879
We must find out

90
00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:27,600
what exactly

91
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:29,480
is recorded on this list.

92
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:30,759
Otherwise,

93
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:32,600
it could very likely become

94
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:34,079
a sharp weapon for invading our land

95
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:37,040
and persecuting our compatriots.

96
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:38,360
We must intercept it.

97
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,439
This is exactly what I hope the organization will consider.

98
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,600
There is one more thing.

99
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,519
I don't know

100
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:47,480
if it is related to this list.

101
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,480
The photos you sent

102
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:51,000
have already been deciphered.

103
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,439
A senior official from the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs,

104
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,439
Kazuo Nakayama,

105
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,160
is about to arrive in Shanghai.

106
00:06:56,439 --> 00:06:57,160
It will be tomorrow.

107
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,839
At this critical moment,

108
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,920
a Ministry of Foreign Affairs official is arriving in Shanghai.

109
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:09,759
You can

110
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,399
share this information with

111
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:12,199
Xie Jun'an

112
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:13,519
and let him determine

113
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:15,240
the accuracy of this information.

114
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,160
Because Xie Jun'an

115
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,360
had dealings with

116
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:19,079
Asai Shou in the past.

117
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,079
He should know Asai Shou.

118
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,720
I understand.

119
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:26,240
But

120
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:28,319
this Xie Jun'an

121
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,439
is not easy to handle.

122
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:31,560
You must be careful.

123
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,439
How are you watching the road?

124
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:34,519
Sorry, sorry.

125
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:35,959
I thought you were going that way.

126
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:37,040
You tell me what to do.

127
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,120
Pay for it.

128
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,399
Sir, your clothes are so expensive.

129
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:41,079
How can I afford to pay for this?

130
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,480
Then come with me to the police station.

131
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,879
Let's go, let's go.

132
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:44,519
Old Tan,

133
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,120
there's one more thing

134
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,399
I want to ask you for a favor.

135
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,560
It's about Zhao Di.

136
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:49,759
Go ahead.

137
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:51,600
His sacrifice and achievements

138
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,680
almost

139
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:54,720
got forgotten by history because of me.

140
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:56,759
I hope you can help

141
00:07:56,959 --> 00:07:58,399
apply to the organization

142
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:00,040
to set up a tombstone for him

143
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,399
for Zhao Di

144
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:02,720
in a quiet place in Yan'an.

145
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,920
I owe him this.

146
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:11,600
Alright.

147
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:21,959
Sister-in-law

148
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:22,480
Yuxin

149
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:24,399
You look really well.

150
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:25,439
Sister-in-law

151
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:27,160
You should have moved here earlier.

152
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,319
Over here, over here

153
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:29,480
You all go out.

154
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,839
Yes, big sister-in-law.

155
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,759
I heard from Old Cui last night.

156
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,799
This is a good thing.

157
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:40,759
Drink slowly.

158
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:44,240
Have a seat.

159
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,919
You're a young woman,

160
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,360
living in a place like that.

161
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:49,879
It's not just that Liang Shuo can't focus on his work,

162
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,919
we're also worried about you.

163
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:53,519
Thank you, sister-in-law.

164
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:55,360
It's all thanks to your concern.

165
00:08:55,759 --> 00:08:58,200
Just think of me as your real sister.

166
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,120
I originally wanted to take care of you.

167
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,399
But I didn't expect to feel unwell these past few days.

168
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:05,000
I haven't been able to eat anything.

169
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,600
I've ended up making things hard for you.

170
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,639
Why are you feeling unwell?

171
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:11,480
You really don't look well.

172
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,799
Didn't Brother Cui take you

173
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:14,240
to the hospital for a checkup?

174
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,279
He...

175
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,639
There's been a lot going on at their headquarters lately.

176
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:18,879
He has to attend that...

177
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:19,759
some kind of big meeting.

178
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,360
When he comes home at night, he just collapses into bed.

179
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:24,120
Sometimes he even talks in his sleep.

180
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,000
It's always in a commanding tone.

181
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,519
How could I trouble him any further?

182
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,360
That won't do.

183
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,480
Let's go.

184
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:32,360
Where to?

185
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,720
I'm taking you to see a doctor.

186
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:34,919
I'm really fine.

187
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:35,559
Come on.

188
00:09:35,559 --> 00:09:36,840
Listen to me.

189
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,320
I'm here to see you.

190
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,039
Let's go.

191
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:46,360
Come in.

192
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,039
Boss.

193
00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:53,360
As you ordered,

194
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,559
the people watching Miss Xie have been withdrawn.

195
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:56,679
Okay.

196
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,559
You all have been working hard lately.

197
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:00,759
Take them.

198
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,120
Let them relax.

199
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,519
Thank you, boss.

200
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,440
Boss.

201
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:08,480
So, according to what you said,

202
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:09,519
does that mean

203
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:11,639
Miss Xie is completely fine now?

204
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,039
That's not for you to say.

205
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:13,960
So say less.

206
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,600
Whether there's a problem or not,

207
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,600
I'll be the one to consider it.

208
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,279
Go.

209
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,919
I'm just worried for you.

210
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:19,759
You see,

211
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:21,360
given your relationship with Director Liang,

212
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,759
if Miss Xie has any issues,

213
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,080
wouldn't that make things awkward for our own people?

214
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,440
Stop trying to act clever with me.

215
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:27,240
Go have some fun.

216
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:28,440
Yes.

217
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:31,960
Play however you like.

218
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,159
Tell the guys,

219
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,080
about anything related to Director Liang,

220
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,159
no gossiping is allowed.

221
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,799
Understood.

222
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:39,799
Go.

223
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,320
Lately,

224
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,639
I haven't been feeling well.

225
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,480
I've been wanting to sleep all the time.

226
00:10:54,919 --> 00:10:57,159
My appetite isn't as good as before, either.

227
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:00,240
How's my pulse, doctor?

228
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,240
The pulse is smooth and steady.

229
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:07,840
Like pearls rolling on a plate.

230
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,919
Madam, you are pregnant.

231
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:12,879
Congratulations, madam.

232
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:14,600
Really?

233
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,559
Sister-in-law.

234
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,120
Congratulations.

235
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,000
I'm finally pregnant.

236
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:24,600
Doctor, could you please prescribe something?

237
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,080
Is there anything we should pay attention to?

238
00:11:27,159 --> 00:11:27,960
Sister-in-law.

239
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:29,600
Congratulations to you.

240
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:33,159
Thank you for coming with me.

241
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,759
I've been married for so long.

242
00:11:34,919 --> 00:11:36,919
Old Cui has always wanted a child.

243
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:37,919
Now,

244
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:39,399
his wish can finally come true.

245
00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:41,240
Such good news

246
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,120
should be told to Brother Cui right away.

247
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:44,399
Let him be happy too.

248
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,200
Then you have to help me come up with ideas.

249
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,200
He's been too busy lately.

250
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,120
I want to

251
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:51,320
find a time

252
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,519
to give him a surprise.

253
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:53,159
Okay.

254
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:55,639
Actually,

255
00:11:55,639 --> 00:11:57,039
I wanted to come help you.

256
00:11:57,039 --> 00:11:59,519
I didn't expect I'd end up needing your help instead.

257
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:01,799
Sister-in-law, you've always been good to me.

258
00:12:01,879 --> 00:12:03,480
It's only right that I help you.

259
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:06,879
My jewelry shop has just started up.

260
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:09,159
And now I need to take care of my health.

261
00:12:09,879 --> 00:12:11,200
So I'll have to trouble you.

262
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,279
When you have time,

263
00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:13,600
please come help me more often.

264
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:15,559
Leave it to me, don't worry.

265
00:12:15,559 --> 00:12:17,720
You just focus on taking care of yourself.

266
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:18,879
Take good care of yourself.

267
00:12:21,879 --> 00:12:22,960
Where did you just go?

268
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,039
What does it have to do with you?

269
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:28,120
Don't try to fool me.

270
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,159
Fool you?

271
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,399
You came looking for me.

272
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,080
I haven't even said anything yet.

273
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,840
What were you doing at Liuhe Pharmacy just now?

274
00:12:36,759 --> 00:12:38,519
Do I have to report everything to you?

275
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:39,879
You follow me around.

276
00:12:39,879 --> 00:12:41,600
Why don't you report everything to me?

277
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,720
At a time like this,

278
00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:44,919
all this suspicion

279
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:46,440
doesn't do us any good.

280
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:48,600
Don't change the subject.

281
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:49,799
Answer me.

282
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,080
What exactly did you do at Liuhe Pharmacy?

283
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,600
I went to buy medicine for Cui Mo.

284
00:12:59,799 --> 00:13:00,960
I'm at No. 76.

285
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,559
Someone has to speak up for me, right?

286
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,919
Can't exactly count on you, can I?

287
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,600
Buying medicine for Cui Mo?

288
00:13:07,879 --> 00:13:09,440
Did it really have to be you?

289
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:11,559
The medicine I was supposed to get for him—

290
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,360
I can't be bothered to explain to you.

291
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:16,919
It's in my drawer.

292
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:20,759
See for yourself.

293
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,559
Tonic pills

294
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,320
Yeah

295
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,679
He’s desperate to have a child

296
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,480
Can you say things like this in front of subordinates?

297
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:41,840
Liang Shuo

298
00:13:42,679 --> 00:13:44,440
You’d better not play any tricks on me

299
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:45,799
You should know

300
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,399
what happens to dissenters in the Military Command

301
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:53,360
Lu Xijian

302
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,080
Ever since Wang Mutian betrayed us

303
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,039
do you see everyone as a traitor?

304
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,279
Let me tell you

305
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:01,279
Don’t try that with me

306
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:02,519
Whether you watch me or not

307
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:03,639
or suspect me or not

308
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:05,399
I really don’t care

309
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,679
The Peace Conference is getting closer

310
00:14:07,879 --> 00:14:09,480
There’s no news about the list at all

311
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:11,399
You should be investigating that

312
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:12,840
not just keeping an eye on me

313
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,600
You really see yourself as Mizuno’s dog

314
00:14:15,799 --> 00:14:17,159
helping him catch spies

315
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:19,080
I’m after spies within the Military Command

316
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,759
If you really doubt my loyalty

317
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,799
go ahead and report me to Scorpio

318
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,200
instead of stabbing me in the back

319
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,080
I’m warning you

320
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,600
Don’t push me too far

321
00:14:29,879 --> 00:14:31,480
Or I’ll show you

322
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:32,679
No. 76

323
00:14:32,679 --> 00:14:35,080
what happens to dissenters here

324
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:40,759
Okay.

325
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:43,519
I believe you.

326
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,759
You’re buying medicine for Cui Mo.

327
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,639
You’d better not let me catch any dirt on you.

328
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,720
My goal is to complete the mission.

329
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:54,320
Everything else doesn’t matter.

330
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,000
Just half an hour ago,

331
00:14:58,399 --> 00:14:59,840
Director Li asked me to attend a meeting.

332
00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:01,759
It’s about time now.

333
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,399
If there’s any new intel,

334
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:05,240
I’ll report it to Scorpio.

335
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:57,440
Looks nice.

336
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:09,840
Yuxin,

337
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,360
what do you think?

338
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:12,720
It looks good.

339
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:13,919
Sister-in-law,

340
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,440
these are all the latest European styles, right?

341
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,399
Yes.

342
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,159
Many of them were brought back by Old Cui's friends

343
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,000
from abroad.

344
00:16:21,159 --> 00:16:22,799
It took a lot of effort.

345
00:16:23,879 --> 00:16:25,279
But not these, right?

346
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,679
This jade pendant—

347
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:30,799
This little girl,

348
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:32,919
why did you put this box here too?

349
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,120
This piece of jade doesn't really match

350
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,399
the other jewelry here.

351
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,000
I think it looks beautiful.

352
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:39,879
Even though new things are trendy now,

353
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,919
for us Chinese women,

354
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,240
jade still suits us best.

355
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,639
My mother has one too.

356
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,480
A jade pendant similar to this one.

357
00:16:49,639 --> 00:16:51,759
So Miss Xie is this traditional.

358
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:52,720
If you like it,

359
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,000
I'll give it to you.

360
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:54,720
Sister-in-law...

361
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,000
That's not what I meant.

362
00:16:57,399 --> 00:16:59,000
You can't turn it down.

363
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,200
Let me tell you,

364
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,440
this piece of jade

365
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,720
was given to me when I just married Lao Cui,

366
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:05,960
by a friend who owns a jade shop.

367
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,880
I've never worn it.

368
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,319
If you like it,

369
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:11,119
you might as well take it.

370
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:12,839
Sister-in-law, I really can't accept it.

371
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,440
Please, don't be so polite with me.

372
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:18,359
I still have something I need your help with.

373
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,119
I haven't even helped you yet.

374
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:21,519
I can't accept a reward without doing anything.

375
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:23,799
If I say I don't want it, I really won't take it.

376
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,400
Look,

377
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,039
it's such a coincidence that it suits you.

378
00:17:42,599 --> 00:17:44,119
Just treat it as a betrothal gift.

379
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,000
Is that not okay?

380
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,160
Mr. Li is here.

381
00:17:54,839 --> 00:17:55,640
Yuxin,

382
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,200
let me introduce you.

383
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,200
This is

384
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,400
Mr. Li.

385
00:17:59,559 --> 00:18:01,920
During the time since our jewelry store just opened,

386
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,599
a lot of things, inside and out,

387
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:05,799
have relied on Mr. Li's help.

388
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,440
Mr. Li,

389
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,160
this is my good friend,

390
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,160
Miss Xie.

391
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,200
Hello, Mr. Li.

392
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:13,720
Nice to meet you.

393
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,279
Hello.

394
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:16,599
Miss Xie.

395
00:18:17,559 --> 00:18:18,440
Madam,

396
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:21,480
Madam, the hair salon just called for you.

397
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,119
They said Master Li is available now.

398
00:18:23,559 --> 00:18:24,799
My turn for the haircut is up.

399
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:26,039
I'll go first, then.

400
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:26,839
Yuxin,

401
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:27,799
please show Mr. Li

402
00:18:27,799 --> 00:18:29,400
around the store.

403
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,480
Don't worry, sister-in-law.

404
00:18:30,519 --> 00:18:31,599
I'm leaving it to you.

405
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,319
Why are you here?

406
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:49,920
Are you following me?

407
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:54,160
Following someone is just a low-level tactic.

408
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:56,200
If I want to know your whereabouts,

409
00:18:56,759 --> 00:18:58,160
I don't need to follow you.

410
00:18:58,759 --> 00:19:00,640
Then how did you know about this shop?

411
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:05,079
Liang Shuo's identity is sensitive.

412
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:06,359
If I want to protect him,

413
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,880
I have to investigate thoroughly

414
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,319
everyone around him.

415
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:10,880
By doing this,

416
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:13,119
you're not really protecting him at all.

417
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,839
It's only temporary.

418
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,640
With this lead,

419
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,720
at least at the most critical moment,

420
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,720
I can deal with Cuimo.

421
00:19:21,079 --> 00:19:22,759
Deal with Cuimo?

422
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,559
I have a favor to ask you.

423
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:30,920
What is it?

424
00:19:31,559 --> 00:19:33,599
Cuimo's wife is Su Xue.

425
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,039
She has no idea what No. 76 is.

426
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,960
She's a good person.

427
00:19:38,359 --> 00:19:40,839
If you're going after Cuimo,

428
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,720
please spare her.

429
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,680
Women and children should not be harmed.

430
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,920
She's pregnant.

431
00:19:48,039 --> 00:19:49,559
Showing sympathy to the enemy

432
00:19:50,319 --> 00:19:52,079
is being cruel to yourself.

433
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:54,200
Who will show sympathy

434
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,839
to our comrades who died at St. George's Church?

435
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:59,319
That's different.

436
00:20:02,599 --> 00:20:03,839
You promise me

437
00:20:07,079 --> 00:20:08,960
I can consider your suggestion

438
00:20:09,799 --> 00:20:11,279
But before that

439
00:20:11,559 --> 00:20:13,000
You must help me with something

440
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:14,519
Go ahead

441
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:15,799
During this period

442
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,640
You can come help at the jewelry store

443
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,279
Continue helping me pass messages to Liang Shuo

444
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:21,680
And keep an eye on Liang Shuo

445
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,599
You still won't let him go

446
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,799
We're short on people right now

447
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,640
How do you expect him to complete the task

448
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,039
To be honest

449
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,519
Getting to this point today

450
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,160
Even I didn't expect it

451
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:37,960
It's precisely because we're short on people

452
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:38,880
So

453
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,240
I'm even less likely to let go of Liang Shuo

454
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:43,240
If you don't agree

455
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:44,880
I can find someone else

456
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,039
I agree

457
00:20:49,079 --> 00:20:50,200
You have to keep your word

458
00:20:50,759 --> 00:20:51,960
After the peace conference

459
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,359
Let him leave Shanghai

460
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:54,799
Don't say those

461
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:56,079
ambiguous things to me anymore

462
00:20:56,359 --> 00:20:57,240
This time

463
00:20:57,799 --> 00:20:59,319
You must keep your promise

464
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:01,720
Deal

465
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,160
I promise you

466
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,440
Alright

467
00:21:14,759 --> 00:21:16,799
The information we received earlier was that

468
00:21:17,079 --> 00:21:18,680
a key official from the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs

469
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,680
Kazuo Nakayama

470
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,599
will arrive in Shanghai tomorrow.

471
00:21:21,799 --> 00:21:22,960
But just today,

472
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,839
we received another message from Nanjing.

473
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,160
They want us to closely monitor this matter.

474
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:29,720
Do you

475
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:31,920
understand what this means?

476
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:33,799
Nanjing suspects

477
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,240
that this is related to the list.

478
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:37,599
The Shanghai station of the Military Bureau was just exposed.

479
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:39,480
At such a sensitive time,

480
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,880
for him to appear in Shanghai

481
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,200
this Kazuo Nakayama

482
00:21:42,359 --> 00:21:44,119
if he has nothing to do with the list,

483
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,000
that would be unbelievable.

484
00:21:46,119 --> 00:21:47,359
You mean

485
00:21:47,359 --> 00:21:48,200
we should get involved?

486
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,480
Not only get involved,

487
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,920
but also participate directly.

488
00:21:54,519 --> 00:21:56,079
Shingen Mizuno won't agree to that.

489
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,000
Liang Shuo,

490
00:21:59,000 --> 00:21:59,920
what do you think?

491
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,519
I have two suggestions.

492
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,319
They are reasons Shingen Mizuno can't refuse.

493
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:07,559
First,

494
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,119
the Shanghai station of the Military Bureau just suffered a major loss.

495
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,519
With Scorpio's vengeful nature,

496
00:22:12,759 --> 00:22:14,079
they will definitely seek revenge.

497
00:22:14,359 --> 00:22:16,079
Although the Japanese military police have large numbers,

498
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:17,920
when it comes to preventing assassinations,

499
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,960
we have the advantage.

500
00:22:22,599 --> 00:22:23,480
Makes sense.

501
00:22:24,039 --> 00:22:24,839
Second,

502
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,400
the visitor is Kazuo Nakayama.

503
00:22:26,519 --> 00:22:28,279
He is an important official from Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

504
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,400
This concerns the diplomatic relations between our two countries.

505
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,799
If a Japanese official

506
00:22:31,799 --> 00:22:33,119
on Chinese soil

507
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:34,279
encounters any problems,

508
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,000
we cannot bear that responsibility.

509
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,319
Chairman Wang

510
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,880
would also never allow us

511
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,759
to be negligent in any way.

512
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,000
Well said, Brother Liang.

513
00:22:42,519 --> 00:22:45,039
It's a pity that Director Liang doesn't show his talents in politics.

514
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:46,359
What a waste of talent.

515
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,359
Alright.

516
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:48,079
Very good.

517
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,200
It seems that now

518
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,920
we must do everything we can

519
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:54,000
to find out the real reason

520
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,880
why Kazuo Nakayama came to Shanghai.

521
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,200
I'll call Nobunaga Mizuno right away.

522
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:08,759
Please.

523
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,519
Come in.

524
00:23:22,039 --> 00:23:22,839
Have a seat.

525
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,400
What is it?

526
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,400
Still not over it?

527
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,000
After all,

528
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,400
you personally took down Wang Mutian.

529
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:41,839
As your mentor,

530
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,559
I have to commend your achievement.

531
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,839
There's nothing to commend.

532
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,599
Dealing with Wang Mutian was my duty.

533
00:23:50,319 --> 00:23:52,640
Any new developments from the Japanese side?

534
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:55,359
Liang Shuo asked me to tell you

535
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,799
that a Japanese man named Nakayama Kazuo

536
00:23:57,799 --> 00:23:59,000
is about to arrive in Shanghai.

537
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:00,880
The Nanjing authorities suspect

538
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,920
that he is the creator of the 3-1 List.

539
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:07,200
Does he have a way to confirm this person's identity?

540
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,000
The creator of the 3-1 List—

541
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,799
you should know him well.

542
00:24:12,839 --> 00:24:15,279
I've met the creator of the 3-1 List.

543
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,920
His name is Asai Hisashi.

544
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,200
Of course,

545
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,079
experienced agents always use aliases.

546
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,759
If we can get a photo

547
00:24:23,759 --> 00:24:25,079
of Nakayama Kazuo,

548
00:24:25,359 --> 00:24:27,519
we can verify his true identity.

549
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:29,640
Alright.

550
00:24:30,079 --> 00:24:31,079
I'll figure something out.

551
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,279
I also want to remind you

552
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,160
Liang Shuo may not be trustworthy

553
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,079
Do you have any evidence?

554
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,400
He used to have a subordinate named Zhao Di

555
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,640
He said this person was his informant

556
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:49,039
Did he ever report this to you?

557
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:53,920
No

558
00:24:54,759 --> 00:24:55,680
However

559
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,200
For a covert informant

560
00:24:57,359 --> 00:24:58,759
He does have the authority

561
00:24:58,759 --> 00:24:59,960
to handle it on his own

562
00:25:02,599 --> 00:25:03,359
So

563
00:25:03,359 --> 00:25:05,319
I suspect Liang Shuo, but I have no evidence

564
00:25:06,279 --> 00:25:07,960
Then I don't need to keep following him

565
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,559
If I were you

566
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,119
I wouldn't jump to conclusions so hastily

567
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:16,960
Don't forget

568
00:25:17,359 --> 00:25:19,039
the teacher's advice to you

569
00:25:20,279 --> 00:25:21,319
At any time

570
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:24,160
never place absolute trust in anyone

571
00:25:26,839 --> 00:25:27,599
I know

572
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:29,039
You've always wanted to prove

573
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:30,400
that you're better than Liang Shuo

574
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,279
I'm giving you this chance now

575
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,119
If he has any problems

576
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,440
you can take his place

577
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:57,720
What's wrong?

578
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:01,160
Sorry.

579
00:26:02,119 --> 00:26:03,720
I was just thinking about the past.

580
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:06,720
By the way,

581
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,960
Xie Jun'an has discovered my identity.

582
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,400
Pingchuan Academy

583
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,680
I can't go there anymore.

584
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:13,920
Otherwise, I'll eventually be exposed to the Japanese.

585
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:15,400
Old Tan said

586
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,799
he'll have me leave Shanghai in a couple of days.

587
00:26:19,839 --> 00:26:20,799
Where will you go?

588
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,000
I don't know.

589
00:26:26,519 --> 00:26:27,640
Maybe

590
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:28,920
Nanjing,

591
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:30,519
or Tianjin.

592
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,839
I'll assume a new identity

593
00:26:33,839 --> 00:26:35,000
and continue living.

594
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,519
You...

595
00:26:37,799 --> 00:26:38,759
don't want to leave.

596
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,000
I want to stay in Shanghai and keep working.

597
00:26:44,359 --> 00:26:45,160
Here,

598
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:48,279
there are people I care about.

599
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,200
All this time,

600
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:03,160
I haven't had the time

601
00:27:03,319 --> 00:27:04,640
to really sit down and talk with you.

602
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,000
Back then,

603
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,079
why did you join the Communist Party?

604
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:16,400
When I left Nanjing back then,

605
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,240
I originally wanted to find you,

606
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,359
but by a twist of fate,

607
00:27:23,359 --> 00:27:25,079
I almost died at the hands of the Japanese.

608
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:26,640
If it hadn't been for Old Tan,

609
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,920
I wouldn't be standing here today.

610
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,799
I shouldn't be asking you this question.

611
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,880
Born in troubled times,

612
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:43,920
we can't control our own fate.

613
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:48,880
It's all in the past now.

614
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,079
Miss Xie

615
00:27:53,319 --> 00:27:54,640
is a good woman.

616
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,400
She was greatly influenced by you.

617
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,240
You were the one who awakened her.

618
00:28:01,839 --> 00:28:02,759
For me,

619
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:04,880
after losing my memory,

620
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:07,039
it was walking side by side with her

621
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,160
that made me feel less alone.

622
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,400
I'm very curious,

623
00:28:16,599 --> 00:28:18,160
what does it feel like

624
00:28:19,079 --> 00:28:20,640
to lose your memory?

625
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,640
It's like being in a vast, endless white fog,

626
00:28:34,039 --> 00:28:35,160
not knowing where you came from,

627
00:28:35,319 --> 00:28:36,680
and unable to see where you're going.

628
00:28:37,599 --> 00:28:39,000
You know you are yourself,

629
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,759
but that's all you know.

630
00:28:49,799 --> 00:28:50,519
Liang Shuo,

631
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,640
no matter how many times you lose your way,

632
00:28:53,319 --> 00:28:54,200
I believe

633
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,880
you will always find the right path.

634
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,359
Your injuries will definitely get better too.

635
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:08,400
Don't worry.

636
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:10,599
I shouldn't be saying this right now

637
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,480
to you.

638
00:29:15,759 --> 00:29:17,279
I'm glad you're willing to talk to me about this.

639
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,440
It makes me happy.

640
00:29:27,319 --> 00:29:28,160
Let's get to business.

641
00:29:30,599 --> 00:29:31,920
We've received some intelligence.

642
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,119
Kazuo Nakayama, who will arrive in Shanghai tomorrow,

643
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,319
is the creator of the list.

644
00:29:36,319 --> 00:29:37,240
Asai Hisashi.

645
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:38,920
Where did the intel come from?

646
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:40,880
Intercepted intel from the Military Statistics Bureau.

647
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:41,880
Xie Jun'an.

648
00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:46,359
The information from the Special Operations Headquarters is about the same.

649
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:47,960
That's good.

650
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,799
Once Kazuo Nakayama arrives in Shanghai,

651
00:29:50,759 --> 00:29:52,759
we'll have a chance to seize the list.

652
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,480
Old Tan has already assigned comrades from the Deyou Grain Store

653
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,519
to provide support from the outside.

654
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:58,079
I'll coordinate with your actions as well.

655
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,880
Kazuo Nakayama is a key protection target.

656
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,079
This won't be easy.

657
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:05,039
But we do have a chance.

658
00:30:05,559 --> 00:30:06,839
The Special Operations Headquarters sent me

659
00:30:06,839 --> 00:30:08,200
to work with the Military Police

660
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:09,640
to jointly protect Kazuo Nakayama.

661
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:10,839
That's great.

662
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,319
This is a godsend.

663
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:13,839
So,

664
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:17,039
you all stay on standby nearby.

665
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:19,000
I'll first try to find out where the list is.

666
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:19,960
Alright.

667
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,359
Be careful with everything.

668
00:30:39,359 --> 00:30:40,079
Sir.

669
00:30:40,599 --> 00:30:41,880
Here's the whiskey you ordered.

670
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,000
Thanks.

671
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,440
Sir, it's about time.

672
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,799
We should head to the airport.

673
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:54,960
Understood.

674
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,400
Everything in Shanghai is ready.

675
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,640
We've already made contact.

676
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:00,519
Your safety

677
00:31:00,519 --> 00:31:01,759
will be handled by Mr. Mizuno

678
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:04,279
and the Special Agent Headquarters.

679
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,039
Chief.

680
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,920
The team has assembled.

681
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:34,720
Shanghai isn't very stable right now.

682
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:36,640
You must be closely protected.

683
00:31:37,119 --> 00:31:39,880
Do your best to achieve great things with Director Liang.

684
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:40,720
Rest assured.

685
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,160
I will definitely assist Director Liang well.

686
00:31:42,359 --> 00:31:43,119
Good.

687
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:44,400
Go ahead.

688
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,440
Yes.

689
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:46,680
Let's go.

690
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:47,319
Yes.

691
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:58,839
Newspapers for sale! Newspapers for sale!

692
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,759
Newspapers for sale!

693
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,480
Give me a newspaper.

694
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,799
What a grand display.

695
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:21,039
Why did you have people from No. 76 come?

696
00:32:22,839 --> 00:32:25,720
This is the chief's strategy.

697
00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:28,960
They wouldn't dare make a mistake.

698
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,400
If they do, it'll be easier to control them.

699
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:35,880
Then what are your military police for?

700
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,160
Special agents have their own roles.

701
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:42,440
They mainly target Chongqing elements and the Communists.

702
00:32:42,759 --> 00:32:44,200
The chief has specially assigned our military police unit

703
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:47,200
to be in charge of your close protection and safety.

704
00:32:47,559 --> 00:32:48,359
This way, please.

705
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:54,839
Director Liang.

706
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:56,440
I hope you've been well.

707
00:32:56,759 --> 00:32:58,400
Mr. Takagi, long time no see.

708
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,200
This way, please.

709
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:08,000
He never lets go of that briefcase.

710
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:10,279
I'll think of a way.

711
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,079
Stay alert.

712
00:33:20,119 --> 00:33:20,920
Newspapers for sale!

713
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:22,680
Newspapers for sale!

714
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:26,839
Hello.

715
00:33:26,839 --> 00:33:27,640
Your ID.

716
00:33:35,759 --> 00:33:37,640
ID.

717
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,519
Open your bag.

718
00:33:51,599 --> 00:33:52,240
Stop.

719
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:53,160
Did you check?

720
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:53,920
Checked.

721
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:55,720
Let's go.

722
00:33:56,119 --> 00:33:56,920
Go in.

723
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,280
Director Liang

724
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:41,559
Do you think there's any problem?

725
00:34:43,519 --> 00:34:45,280
The advantage of living here is

726
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,679
the rooms are spacious and comfortable.

727
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:48,840
But the downside is

728
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:50,679
the ceiling is too low.

729
00:34:51,079 --> 00:34:53,000
The opposite side can easily be used as a sniper point.

730
00:34:53,079 --> 00:34:54,039
So I suggest

731
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:55,719
when Mr. Zhongshan is here,

732
00:34:56,039 --> 00:34:57,719
all the curtains should be drawn.

733
00:34:58,159 --> 00:34:58,960
Additionally,

734
00:34:59,239 --> 00:35:01,599
add more observation posts and sentries nearby.

735
00:35:01,639 --> 00:35:03,639
Only then can we ensure absolute safety.

736
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,559
Truly professional.

737
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,599
Deploy both visible and hidden sentries.

738
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,119
Tell them to stay alert.

739
00:35:14,519 --> 00:35:15,159
Yes.

740
00:35:16,559 --> 00:35:18,239
Mr. Zhongshan has just arrived in Shanghai.

741
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,039
He still needs to visit the chief.

742
00:35:20,239 --> 00:35:22,920
I'll leave the security here to you and Director Cui.

743
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:23,960
Of course.

744
00:35:27,039 --> 00:35:30,239
Please make sure to guard my room well.

745
00:35:30,239 --> 00:35:33,079
No one is allowed to enter.

746
00:35:36,119 --> 00:35:37,039
Assign people to guard it around the clock in shifts.

747
00:35:37,039 --> 00:35:37,679
Yes.

748
00:35:57,239 --> 00:35:58,400
Leaving so soon?

749
00:36:00,239 --> 00:36:01,840
They're really giving us a chance.

750
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,280
Where's the briefcase?

751
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,679
It's in the upstairs safe.

752
00:36:04,719 --> 00:36:06,320
I saw him lock it in there myself.

753
00:36:06,639 --> 00:36:07,679
How's the security?

754
00:36:08,119 --> 00:36:09,920
There are military police guarding the corridors and hallways.

755
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:11,880
So what should we do?

756
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,199
Otherwise,

757
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,480
let's get two of our guys

758
00:36:14,679 --> 00:36:15,960
to bring some cigarettes and alcohol upstairs.

759
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,119
Then wait for the right moment to act.

760
00:36:17,559 --> 00:36:18,679
That's too obvious.

761
00:36:19,079 --> 00:36:20,360
If something really happens,

762
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:22,000
how could Mizuno Shingen not suspect

763
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,280
that we stole from under our own watch?

764
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,760
Let me think of another way.

765
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,840
As long as we can find evidence of the list,

766
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,480
the Special Affairs Committee

767
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,679
can intervene in the matter.

768
00:37:06,159 --> 00:37:07,199
Are you trying to get yourself killed?

769
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:08,440
There's a curfew outside.

770
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,840
Our people can't get close.

771
00:37:10,039 --> 00:37:11,400
I'm worried about you carrying out the mission alone.

772
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,239
It could be dangerous.

773
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:14,039
And coming here like this isn't dangerous?

774
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,280
Don't worry.

775
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,039
Two days ago,

776
00:37:16,039 --> 00:37:17,840
I already checked in under the identity of a Japanese expatriate.

777
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:18,880
I've registered my stay.

778
00:37:19,079 --> 00:37:19,880
Even if I leave,

779
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,119
no one will suspect anything.

780
00:37:23,159 --> 00:37:24,960
This whole thing seems a bit strange.

781
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,239
The list is supposed to be of utmost importance.

782
00:37:27,559 --> 00:37:29,639
But Takagi Yuuichi and Nakayama Kazuo

783
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,360
left early.

784
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,679
They just left the list behind.

785
00:37:36,039 --> 00:37:37,440
Did they notice something?

786
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:38,280
No.

787
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,440
It's just my intuition.

788
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:44,440
We've come this far.

789
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:45,760
No matter what,

790
00:37:46,159 --> 00:37:47,400
we have to give it a try.

791
00:37:58,519 --> 00:38:00,199
There are two military police guarding the hallway.

792
00:38:00,679 --> 00:38:02,119
We need to find a way to distract them.

793
00:38:08,239 --> 00:38:09,360
Hold this for me.

794
00:38:12,519 --> 00:38:13,400
I have an idea.

795
00:38:15,239 --> 00:38:17,280
Newspapers for sale! Newspapers for sale!

796
00:38:19,079 --> 00:38:20,880
Get your newspapers!

797
00:38:26,639 --> 00:38:27,239
Sir,

798
00:38:27,239 --> 00:38:28,800
that rickshaw puller looks suspicious.

799
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,679
Mr. Mizuno is truly perceptive.

800
00:38:41,039 --> 00:38:43,880
As expected, the anti-Japanese elements are making a move.

801
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,639
Hold your positions for now.

802
00:38:45,639 --> 00:38:47,719
Assign someone to keep a close watch on those two.

803
00:38:47,719 --> 00:38:48,519
Yes, sir.

804
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,239
Stop.

805
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,840
I'm here to clean.

806
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:06,239
This area is under lockdown.

807
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,400
Sorry.

808
00:39:09,679 --> 00:39:11,039
This area is already under lockdown.

809
00:39:11,039 --> 00:39:12,280
Doesn't she know?

810
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,679
Very suspicious.

811
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:15,199
Stop.

812
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:16,320
Stop.

813
00:39:17,159 --> 00:39:17,960
Stop.

814
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:19,280
Stop.

815
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,039
Stop.

816
00:39:20,119 --> 00:39:20,920
Stop.

817
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,039
Don't move.

818
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,400
I'm here to clean.

819
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:28,199
Don't move.

820
00:39:29,559 --> 00:39:30,360
ID.

821
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:42,519
Hands up.
