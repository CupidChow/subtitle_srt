1
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:47,760
Liang Shuo

2
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:49,760
Don't think I don't know.

3
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,519
Team Leader Chen

4
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:55,040
Barking like a dog

5
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:57,079
You should still keep your eyes open.

6
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,040
If your teeth aren't strong, don't bite off more than you can chew.

7
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:02,280
Even kids understand this.

8
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,359
Why can't you learn?

9
00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:05,239
Liang Shuo, you—

10
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:10,719
Director

11
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,039
Director

12
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,599
I have something important to report to you privately.

13
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,039
Director

14
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:21,719
Team Leader Chen

15
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,000
You don't need to explain anymore.

16
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:27,159
Your subordinate has just confessed.

17
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,960
You were at the scene.

18
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,479
All the assassination operations

19
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,439
were directed by you.

20
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,400
I—

21
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,120
Guards!

22
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:35,960
Take him to the interrogation room.

23
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,039
Interrogate him thoroughly.

24
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:37,840
Director

25
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,919
Director

26
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:40,879
Move.

27
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:43,439
Director

28
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:45,439
Director

29
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,759
Liang Shuo

30
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,680
Director

31
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:54,960
I'm innocent, Director!

32
00:02:57,039 --> 00:02:58,080
Director Li

33
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:00,560
You really are magnanimous.

34
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,719
If it were me,

35
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,560
I would have sent him straight to the execution ground.

36
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,919
This Chen Gengsheng

37
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,000
has also been with the Special Operations Headquarters for a long time.

38
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,840
Before everything is fully clarified,

39
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,159
I think we should be more cautious.

40
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,759
Spend a bit more time

41
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,039
to get to the bottom of the truth.

42
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,360
It's absolutely necessary.

43
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:23,319
Director Li

44
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:25,319
When the investigation results are out,

45
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,360
please inform me as soon as possible.

46
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,439
After all, as the victim,

47
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:30,800
I trust that Director Li

48
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,800
won't refuse my request.

49
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,080
Of course.

50
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,960
Internal transparency

51
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,360
is our principle in investigations.

52
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:41,360
Besides,

53
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:43,719
Director Liang made a contribution today.

54
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,960
I will definitely be fair.

55
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,120
As for Chen Gengsheng,

56
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,719
leave him to me.

57
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:50,120
Alright.

58
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:51,879
It's getting late.

59
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:53,280
Let's call it a day.

60
00:03:54,039 --> 00:03:55,120
As for what comes next,

61
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,280
let's discuss it tomorrow.

62
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,639
Gentlemen, may I ask who you are looking for?

63
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:29,600
Hello.

64
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,199
I am Takagi Yuyi from the Customs Investigation Bureau.

65
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:36,560
I am here on behalf of Director Mizuno of the Ume Agency.

66
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:38,160
I have an appointment.

67
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:40,920
Yes, yes.

68
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:41,639
Who are you looking for?

69
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:42,800
I'll inform them for you.

70
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,920
Wang Qiaosu.

71
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:46,120
Director Wang.

72
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:47,879
He's on the second floor.

73
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:48,560
This way, please.

74
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:22,680
This way.

75
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,079
Please.

76
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:31,319
Director Wang, someone is here to see you.

77
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,879
Director Wang.

78
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:50,120
Where is the person?

79
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,759
Where is he?

80
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:52,839
I don't know.

81
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:54,000
He was just here a moment ago.

82
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:54,639
Search.

83
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,160
He left in a hurry.

84
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,360
Someone leaked information.

85
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,800
Mr. Mizuno was right.

86
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:13,920
The Peace Conference is about to begin.

87
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:19,120
We must not relax our supervision of key departments.

88
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:26,720
The location where the anti-Japanese elements are hiding explosives

89
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:33,279
is within the delivery area of this North Shanghai post office.

90
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:15,160
We faced danger twice tonight.

91
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:17,680
It was all thanks to Director Liang risking his life to save us.

92
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,040
If it weren't for you,

93
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:19,959
Not at all.

94
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,639
You're too kind, sir.

95
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,519
For Director Liang,

96
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,160
it might have been an easy task.

97
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:28,040
But for Xizi,

98
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:29,720
it was a lifesaving favor.

99
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:31,319
I will never forget it.

100
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,199
Chief Hirata, you overstate it.

101
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,959
I was just performing my duty as an escort.

102
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:36,000
The responsibility is great.

103
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:37,920
I was simply fulfilling my mission.

104
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:42,079
The evidence against Chen Gengsheng is now conclusive.

105
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,560
It seems

106
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:45,639
he is the one Director Liang

107
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,040
mentioned

108
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,959
as the mole within headquarters.

109
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,000
But what the truth really is

110
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,759
still depends on headquarters

111
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,480
and the Special Affairs Committee's final decision.

112
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:57,240
As for matters in the department,

113
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,800
there's no need to rush for now.

114
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:02,160
Director Liang should get some rest now.

115
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,399
Thank you for your concern, sir.

116
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:06,480
I still have a lot of work to handle.

117
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,759
If the work isn't finished,

118
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:09,600
it's hard to feel at ease.

119
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,600
Within headquarters,

120
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,800
if everyone were as dedicated as Director Liang,

121
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,759
diligently fulfilling their duties,

122
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,879
then our goal of establishing Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity

123
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:19,160
would soon be within reach.

124
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:21,560
Director Liang's achievements today

125
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:24,519
will be fully reported to Mr. Mizuno.

126
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:27,920
Thank you for your support, sir.

127
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,759
Teacher

128
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:43,279
Junior Sister

129
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:43,960
Senior Brother

130
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,159
Where did you put the explosives?

131
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:47,519
At a transport company on Rui'an Road.

132
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,320
The goods are on a truck.

133
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,440
We didn't dare unload them.

134
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,759
They're covered with canvas.

135
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:53,080
Disguised as construction materials.

136
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,799
Two of our brothers are watching over them.

137
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,799
If they're discovered,

138
00:08:55,799 --> 00:08:56,919
they can be moved at any time.

139
00:08:57,919 --> 00:08:59,399
You always handle things so reliably.

140
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,360
Although the venue for the Peace Conference

141
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,120
hasn't been finalized,

142
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:05,960
it won't be outside the northern district of Shanghai.

143
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:10,759
These explosives

144
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:12,519
can't all be transported there directly.

145
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,840
They need to be delivered in batches.

146
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:14,960
Be ready to act at any time.

147
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,360
Teacher

148
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:20,600
How should we distribute the explosives?

149
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,679
Use the postal route.

150
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,879
Send them through regular delivery channels.

151
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,639
I've already prepared a family letter for the director

152
00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:28,519
Wang Qiaosu

153
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:30,039
of the northern Shanghai postal branch.

154
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,440
Once he sees the letter,

155
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:32,320
he'll make the arrangements.

156
00:09:32,759 --> 00:09:33,480
Sir

157
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:35,399
Sir

158
00:09:35,559 --> 00:09:36,799
There's been an incident at the northern Shanghai post office.

159
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,480
The post office contact reported

160
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,120
that the Japanese just raided the post office.

161
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:41,879
They said

162
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,519
they were looking for Director Wang Qiaosu to talk.

163
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:45,080
Director Wang sensed something was wrong

164
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,120
and left early.

165
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:48,399
The Japanese, in their anger, even killed the gatekeeper.

166
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,679
Postal route

167
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:58,799
is the weakest link in the entire plan.

168
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:00,840
There is a lot of coming and going of people.

169
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,279
It's the hardest to withstand investigation.

170
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:03,960
I didn't expect it.

171
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,000
The part I worried about the most still had a problem.

172
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:08,840
Mizuno Shingen must have been watching

173
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,320
Wang Qiaosu's line for a while.

174
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,200
That's why the military police reacted so quickly.

175
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:17,320
Fortunately, Wang Qiaosu has already escaped.

176
00:10:19,879 --> 00:10:21,919
We can only prepare for the worst.

177
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,360
Try to contact Liang Shuo.

178
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:25,399
I want to see him.

179
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:27,159
Okay.

180
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:30,759
Newspapers for sale! Newspapers for sale!

181
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,919
Get your newspapers! Get your newspapers!

182
00:10:32,919 --> 00:10:33,960
Current Affairs News

183
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,519
Come here, child.

184
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:36,600
Buy a newspaper.

185
00:10:36,759 --> 00:10:37,559
Sir, here you go.

186
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,120
Thank you, sir.

187
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,279
Newspapers for sale! Newspapers for sale!

188
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,440
Take a look at this news.

189
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:54,200
The mail route has been destroyed.

190
00:10:55,039 --> 00:10:56,279
Wang Qiaosu has escaped.

191
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,120
Mizuno Shingen.

192
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,399
This move uses offense as defense.

193
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,879
It's truly impressive.

194
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:06,480
Even someone like Xie Jun'an

195
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:09,039
has gotten caught up in this.

196
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:13,000
What should we do about this?

197
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,120
Although this is an issue for the Military Bureau of Investigation and Statistics,

198
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:18,720
we can't possibly cooperate with them.

199
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,399
However,

200
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,039
if their operation is put on hold,

201
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,799
the Japanese will turn their attention elsewhere.

202
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,360
This will definitely affect our rescue plan.

203
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:30,600
Moreover,

204
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,200
I'm also worried

205
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,919
because Wang Qiaosu has a special status.

206
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,120
If he falls into the hands of the Japanese,

207
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,559
it could threaten Comrade Qingshuang's undercover mission

208
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:39,559
and put it at risk.

209
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:48,679
Your concern

210
00:11:49,159 --> 00:11:50,240
is not unfounded.

211
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,200
I request that the organization pay attention to this matter.

212
00:11:56,919 --> 00:11:57,480
Alright.

213
00:11:57,919 --> 00:11:58,600
I will immediately

214
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,000
report this to the organization.

215
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:01,639
If there is any news,

216
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,679
I will send someone to contact you.

217
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,360
Didn't you have something to say to me?

218
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,159
I'm giving you the chance right now.

219
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:25,799
Director.

220
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,879
You have to trust me.

221
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,360
I've always been loyal.

222
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,399
It's just that this time,

223
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:36,559
I was set up by Liang Shuo.

224
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,519
Director, you know that.

225
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,399
I've always suspected Liang Shuo.

226
00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:46,200
So after Liang Shuo came back on the 18th,

227
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:49,000
I've been keeping an eye on him.

228
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:52,120
During the previous headquarters gathering,

229
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,440
I had someone pose as a Chongqing agent.

230
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,480
To make contact with him.

231
00:12:55,879 --> 00:12:57,960
The meeting place was Jiangfeng Restaurant.

232
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,639
He was informed of the meeting time.

233
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,639
It was 8 o'clock last night.

234
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,120
You mean,

235
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,200
Liang Shuo knew about Jiangfeng Restaurant?

236
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,799
Yes.

237
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,720
I have a recording of this.

238
00:13:13,879 --> 00:13:15,120
It can be used as evidence.

239
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:16,919
Then why didn't you say anything last night?

240
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,279
Liang Shuo doesn't know I have a recording.

241
00:13:23,559 --> 00:13:25,600
This person is good at twisting the truth.

242
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,039
He's way too cunning.

243
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:29,919
I need to let you know first.

244
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:31,600
Director, think about it.

245
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:34,279
Liang Shuo knows very well

246
00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:37,120
that he was supposed to meet the Chongqing agents at Jiangfeng Restaurant.

247
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,919
But he knew and didn't report it.

248
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,519
What does that tell us?

249
00:13:40,759 --> 00:13:43,240
At the very least, it suggests he might be covering for them.

250
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:46,200
And this time, not only did he not report it,

251
00:13:46,279 --> 00:13:47,960
he even tried to frame me instead.

252
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:50,000
What does that mean?

253
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,960
It means Liang Shuo saw through your plan.

254
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,600
And he didn't report it.

255
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,759
Instead, at the same time,

256
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:01,600
he was active near Jiangfeng Restaurant.

257
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,240
That's right.

258
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,559
I can't outsmart him.

259
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:07,879
There's definitely something wrong with Liang Shuo.

260
00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:13,039
What about the recording?

261
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,320
Morning.

262
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:29,000
You're here so early.

263
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,440
Chen Gengsheng has already been interrogated.

264
00:14:30,679 --> 00:14:31,679
Let's talk as we walk.

265
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:34,120
I don't know what the Director is thinking either.

266
00:14:34,279 --> 00:14:35,279
He specifically named you.

267
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,039
He wants you to interrogate Chen Gengsheng personally.

268
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,159
The Director knows I don't get along with him.

269
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:42,919
Is he trying to make me go all out against him?

270
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,200
Brother Cui,

271
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:45,960
you'd better think this through.

272
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:47,559
Don't overthink it.

273
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,600
This also shows

274
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,720
that the Director trusts you.

275
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,279
Director

276
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,399
Found in Chief Chen's office

277
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:02,600
Put it over there

278
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:03,480
Okay

279
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:06,960
Director

280
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,840
Are you suspecting Liang Shuo

281
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,279
or Chen Gengsheng

282
00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:16,440
Until someone can prove their innocence

283
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,879
I don't trust anyone

284
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,200
Then why do you

285
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:26,960
want Director Liang to go to the interrogation room

286
00:15:28,279 --> 00:15:29,559
Is that hard to understand

287
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:32,000
To test a person

288
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,320
the best way

289
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:34,919
is to give him power

290
00:15:34,919 --> 00:15:35,799
and give him money

291
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,559
Now Liang Shuo holds

292
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:40,399
the power of life and death

293
00:15:41,559 --> 00:15:43,559
If he has something to hide

294
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:46,799
what will he do

295
00:15:49,159 --> 00:15:50,960
Director, that's very insightful

296
00:15:51,879 --> 00:15:54,000
Then I'll go watch over the interrogation room

297
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,000
Yes

298
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:13,879
Chief Chen

299
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,960
I told you not to move. Stop moving.

300
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:16,840
See?

301
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,639
What a waste of a good tooth.

302
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:19,840
Such a pity.

303
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:21,879
Liang Shuo

304
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,720
I'll kill you.

305
00:16:26,279 --> 00:16:28,960
Chief Chen, it seems you still don't understand the situation.

306
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:30,799
You're the one tied up now.

307
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:31,720
Not me.

308
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:34,320
Your identity as a Military Command agent has already been exposed.

309
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:35,799
You'd better confess now.

310
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,840
Save yourself from unnecessary suffering.

311
00:16:37,879 --> 00:16:38,799
Nonsense.

312
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,159
You're the Military Command agent.

313
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:44,919
Watch your mouth.

314
00:16:44,919 --> 00:16:45,519
Our boss has already

315
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:47,240
been more than generous to you.

316
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,440
If you keep pushing your luck,

317
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,919
it won't end well.

318
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,240
Turn on the electricity.

319
00:16:51,639 --> 00:16:52,440
Enough.

320
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:54,080
Old Yu

321
00:16:54,159 --> 00:16:54,840
Boss

322
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,879
Did you forget how he bullied you?

323
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,799
If he dies, you'll be responsible.

324
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,360
I'm still hoping

325
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,279
to get information out of him.

326
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:04,559
What?

327
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:06,079
You're not interrogating him anymore?

328
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,000
Brother Cui,

329
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:11,880
you handle the interrogation.

330
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,440
Team Leader Chen and I don't get along.

331
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,680
If I do the questioning,

332
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,880
he'll probably grit his teeth and hold out until the end.

333
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,720
That won't help our progress at all.

334
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,000
I like a good fight,

335
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:22,400
but I don't like beating a dead dog.

336
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,640
It's too boring.

337
00:17:24,759 --> 00:17:25,240
Alright.

338
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:26,599
You take a break.

339
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:36,960
Team Leader Chen,

340
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,480
we're switching people.

341
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:39,920
I'll play with you for a bit.

342
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,000
Director,

343
00:17:52,359 --> 00:17:53,440
he's very restrained.

344
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,920
Now it's Director Cui handling the interrogation.

345
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,599
Pause for a moment.

346
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,000
Let Cui Mo come over.

347
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,119
Yes.

348
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:14,319
Director

349
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:15,200
You wanted to see me?

350
00:18:17,559 --> 00:18:18,519
Any progress?

351
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:19,880
As you instructed,

352
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:20,839
we didn't use harsh interrogation.

353
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,039
Just tried to scare him a bit.

354
00:18:22,279 --> 00:18:23,119
Didn't expect it,

355
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:24,920
that kid looks so shifty,

356
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,839
but he's actually pretty tough.

357
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:27,680
Take a look at this.

358
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:31,799
What's this?

359
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,160
He tried to bribe me.

360
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:34,920
He told me there's

361
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,400
fifteen gold bars in his family's safe.

362
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,599
That does sound like him.

363
00:18:40,279 --> 00:18:40,960
Alright.

364
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:42,720
Listen to this.

365
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:43,799
What is it?

366
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,000
Chen Gengsheng wiretapped Liang Shuo.

367
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,400
Sir, long time no see.

368
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:54,319
And you are?

369
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,599
Sir, you really do have a short memory.

370
00:18:57,759 --> 00:18:59,960
We just met yesterday.

371
00:19:02,359 --> 00:19:04,200
Scorpio asked me to give you a message.

372
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,759
Tomorrow night at eight.

373
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:07,119
Second floor of Jiangfeng Restaurant.

374
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:09,359
There's an important matter to discuss.

375
00:19:14,839 --> 00:19:16,200
You've got the wrong person.

376
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:21,759
That's all.

377
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:26,799
What does that prove?

378
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:29,039
Because he heard the codename "Scorpio,"

379
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:30,359
his reaction was way too calm.

380
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:33,799
After all, information about Scorpio was leaked.

381
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,559
Then tell me,

382
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,240
why didn't he report it?

383
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:40,200
Maybe someone was just joking.

384
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,799
Or maybe someone wanted to frame him.

385
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:42,759
A joke?

386
00:19:44,519 --> 00:19:46,000
He knew about Jiangfeng Restaurant,

387
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,799
and the meeting time.

388
00:19:48,119 --> 00:19:49,319
How does that look like

389
00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:51,519
a coincidence at all?

390
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:54,240
So you think

391
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:56,599
Liang Shuo is setting up Chen Gengsheng?

392
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,319
At the very least, it proves

393
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,720
he's definitely involved.

394
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:06,400
Even though this recording isn't evidence,

395
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,200
it's still an important clue.

396
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:13,759
So between these two,

397
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:14,880
who's lying?

398
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,160
Maybe,

399
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,279
both of them

400
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:22,799
are lying.

401
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,599
Better to be cautious.

402
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,519
You,

403
00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:31,599
should go and verify

404
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:33,480
the clues provided by Chen Gengsheng.

405
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,640
Also,

406
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,559
make good use of

407
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:39,599
this safe key.

408
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,799
Do you know what to do?

409
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,279
What,

410
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,640
is this the time to show Gu Nian any sentiment?

411
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,519
Don't worry.

412
00:20:57,599 --> 00:20:59,119
If he really is a Chongqing agent,

413
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,839
I definitely won't show any mercy.

414
00:21:12,519 --> 00:21:13,400
Brother Cui,

415
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,599
You were looking for me?

416
00:21:17,079 --> 00:21:18,759
You’ve probably guessed why I wanted to see you.

417
00:21:24,039 --> 00:21:24,880
Brother Cui

418
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,119
I just came from the interrogation room.

419
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,160
You chose this place again.

420
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,640
Are you trying to give me a heads-up?

421
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,599
From the Japanese side,

422
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,000
about tipping me off,

423
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,400
I still haven't thanked you.

424
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,359
We're like brothers.

425
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,880
If we're talking about returning favors,

426
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,240
I won't say much more.

427
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,759
But now, Brother Cui,

428
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,559
you're being so mysterious with me.

429
00:21:46,279 --> 00:21:47,759
I really can't tell

430
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:49,400
if you're bringing good news or bad.

431
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:51,240
Do you realize

432
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,759
you're about to be in big trouble?

433
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,519
Big trouble?

434
00:21:57,559 --> 00:21:58,599
What do you mean, Brother Cui?

435
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,640
Chen Gengsheng has indeed been imprisoned.

436
00:22:02,839 --> 00:22:03,799
But after all,

437
00:22:03,799 --> 00:22:05,559
he's the head of the 76th Communications Group.

438
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,319
Don't you think this time

439
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:10,200
you won a little too easily?

440
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,599
He was eavesdropping on you.

441
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:13,960
Now he has this attitude

442
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,359
like he's ready to go down fighting.

443
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:17,920
He admitted to what happened at Jiangfeng Restaurant.

444
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,440
He set that trap for you.

445
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:21,319
He has already handed over the listening device.

446
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,920
Just to drag you down with him.

447
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:25,960
I knew Chen Gengsheng wasn't that simple.

448
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,720
But I'm really curious,

449
00:22:27,799 --> 00:22:29,720
what exactly did he overhear?

450
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,599
What did he overhear?

451
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,720
No one knows right now.

452
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,920
But by tomorrow at the latest,

453
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,440
the interrogation room will call you in for questioning.

454
00:22:37,359 --> 00:22:38,720
Luckily, you have me as your brother.

455
00:22:40,519 --> 00:22:41,680
I can help you.

456
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:45,839
What is this?

457
00:22:46,119 --> 00:22:47,319
The key to the safe.

458
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:48,680
Chen Gengsheng at home

459
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,359
hid fifteen gold bars.

460
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,440
He wants to bribe me.

461
00:22:52,319 --> 00:22:53,119
Brother Cui,

462
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,680
this thing

463
00:22:56,279 --> 00:22:58,160
shouldn’t it be handed over to the director?

464
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,920
Why give it to me?

465
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:05,960
What do I mean by this?

466
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,200
Don’t you understand?

467
00:23:10,279 --> 00:23:12,000
Right now, only I know about this.

468
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,880
What exactly is in the safe

469
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:14,920
no one knows.

470
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,200
If you really don’t feel at ease,

471
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,200
you could always

472
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:19,839
plant some

473
00:23:19,839 --> 00:23:22,319
evidence of Chen Gengsheng colluding with the military.

474
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:24,000
As long as before tomorrow’s hearing

475
00:23:24,279 --> 00:23:25,720
you return the key to me, that’s enough.

476
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,839
Brother Cui, oh Brother Cui,

477
00:23:50,519 --> 00:23:52,279
what can I even say about you?

478
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,039
What do you mean?

479
00:23:54,519 --> 00:23:55,799
I’m helping you here.

480
00:23:56,359 --> 00:23:58,039
I know you’re helping me, Brother Cui.

481
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:00,680
I really deserve to die.

482
00:24:01,119 --> 00:24:03,000
I actually doubted you, Brother Cui.

483
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:03,960
Doubted me?

484
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,880
What did you doubt me about?

485
00:24:06,599 --> 00:24:07,759
Forget it, it’s embarrassing to say.

486
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:08,720
No, no, no, don’t—

487
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,440
You’d better make yourself clear.

488
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,799
If you’re so vague about it,

489
00:24:11,839 --> 00:24:13,200
and someone else hears about it,

490
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,160
at No. 76, I—

491
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,079
I won’t be able to show my face.

492
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:18,039
How could I possibly tell anyone else?

493
00:24:19,119 --> 00:24:20,440
I was just thinking,

494
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,279
when Hirata Noriko and I

495
00:24:22,839 --> 00:24:24,799
were attacked at the Lianjia Alley warehouse,

496
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,359
this place,

497
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,240
only you, me, and her knew about it.

498
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:29,920
No one else could possibly know.

499
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:30,559
Right.

500
00:24:31,079 --> 00:24:33,079
So how did Chen Gengsheng get the information?

501
00:24:33,119 --> 00:24:34,559
He even sent people to assassinate us.

502
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,319
Besides,

503
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,880
Hirata Noriko and I

504
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,440
were the first to find out,

505
00:24:39,599 --> 00:24:41,279
and we left immediately.

506
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,359
Even if the information had leaked,

507
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,680
Chen Gengsheng wouldn't have had time to set things up.

508
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:46,920
Right?

509
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:48,839
So after thinking it over and over,

510
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,319
I started to suspect you, Brother Cui.

511
00:24:51,559 --> 00:24:52,400
How could—

512
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,440
How could you possibly suspect me?

513
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,519
How could I ever harm you?

514
00:24:55,519 --> 00:24:56,559
That's impossible.

515
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,599
So,

516
00:24:57,839 --> 00:24:59,440
after what you just said, Brother Cui,

517
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,079
I realized

518
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,559
there's no way it was you.

519
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,119
What did I say?

520
00:25:04,759 --> 00:25:05,839
Didn't you tell me

521
00:25:06,359 --> 00:25:09,359
that Chen Gengsheng had been monitoring me all along?

522
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,200
If he could monitor me,

523
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,440
he could monitor you too, Brother Cui.

524
00:25:13,599 --> 00:25:14,400
Yes, yes, exactly.

525
00:25:15,079 --> 00:25:16,119
That bastard Chen Gengsheng

526
00:25:16,119 --> 00:25:17,400
really deserves to die.

527
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,359
Brother,

528
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,240
good thing you understand.

529
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:21,799
The key.

530
00:25:28,039 --> 00:25:29,039
It's all right.

531
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:30,319
Brother Cui, your kindness

532
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:31,480
I understand.

533
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,200
I know you're looking out for me.

534
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:34,079
But,

535
00:25:34,279 --> 00:25:35,000
first of all,

536
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,960
hiding such important evidence

537
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,799
would put you at great risk.

538
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,039
I couldn't bear that.

539
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,319
Secondly,

540
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:42,680
this matter

541
00:25:43,119 --> 00:25:45,079
has nothing to do with me in the first place.

542
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,559
My conscience is clear.

543
00:25:46,839 --> 00:25:48,559
Why make things more complicated?

544
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,240
And if someone finds out,

545
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,920
it could give them something to use against us.

546
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,799
If you haven't done anything wrong,

547
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,240
you have nothing to fear.

548
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:55,960
Brother,

549
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,759
hearing you say that puts me at ease.

550
00:25:58,799 --> 00:25:59,599
All right then,

551
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,319
I appreciate your kindness,

552
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:02,599
and I accept it in my heart.

553
00:26:02,599 --> 00:26:04,119
I'll remember this.

554
00:26:04,119 --> 00:26:05,720
I'll head back to work now.

555
00:26:06,079 --> 00:26:07,240
After this is over,

556
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:09,119
I'll treat you to a drink, Brother Cui.

557
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,279
What is it?

558
00:26:19,319 --> 00:26:22,200
You had the nerve to make private arrangements behind my back.

559
00:26:22,279 --> 00:26:23,799
Now that it's been discovered,

560
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,559
what do you have to say for yourself?

561
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,359
Director,

562
00:26:26,599 --> 00:26:28,039
I had no other choice.

563
00:26:28,279 --> 00:26:29,319
That woman, Hirata Xizi,

564
00:26:29,319 --> 00:26:30,400
has already started investigating us.

565
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,799
I had to sacrifice the pawn to save the king.

566
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,000
Do you think

567
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,200
that if you don't tell me,

568
00:26:38,279 --> 00:26:39,319
I'll never

569
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:40,759
find out for the rest of my life?

570
00:26:40,839 --> 00:26:42,039
I wouldn't dare.

571
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,640
I just wanted to ease your worries.

572
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:45,440
Last time, with the incident involving Lu Xijian from the Inspection Office,

573
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,039
you were already furious.

574
00:26:47,519 --> 00:26:48,400
I thought

575
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,319
there was no need to trouble you with unnecessary worries.

576
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,160
How grand and dignified your words sound.

577
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,359
The more you try to cover it up, the more obvious it becomes.

578
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,400
Director,

579
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,799
it's not for anything else.

580
00:26:58,039 --> 00:27:00,000
The brothers working under us

581
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,599
are all risking their lives.

582
00:27:01,599 --> 00:27:03,000
I have to let them get a little benefit, don't I?

583
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:04,200
Would I let her succeed?

584
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:07,960
So, Director Cui,

585
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,519
you really are selfless, aren't you?

586
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,519
All the mistakes are my fault.

587
00:27:13,519 --> 00:27:14,480
Please punish me, Director.

588
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,599
Don't play these tricks with me.

589
00:27:16,079 --> 00:27:17,160
If you hide things from me again,

590
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,039
if you dare do it again,

591
00:27:18,039 --> 00:27:19,200
there absolutely won't be a next time.

592
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:25,480
The way to deceive Hirata Xizi

593
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,440
was taught to you by Liang Shuo.

594
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,039
Yes.

595
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,440
Why did he want to help you?

596
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:34,599
What exactly is he after?

597
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,079
Director.

598
00:27:36,319 --> 00:27:37,599
Liang Shuo has done enough for these brothers—

599
00:27:37,599 --> 00:27:38,359
Shut up.

600
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,799
Don't talk to me about this disgusting brotherhood nonsense.

601
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:44,759
Director.

602
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,000
If you really think

603
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,400
Liang Shuo is still a suspect,

604
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,000
then bring him here and confront him face to face.

605
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:49,680
You—

606
00:27:50,279 --> 00:27:51,160
You...

607
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,200
Hello, Director Liang.

608
00:28:23,079 --> 00:28:24,559
Director Liang, what brings you here?

609
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,000
I want to see the Director.

610
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:33,160
Director.

611
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,599
Director Liang requests to see you.

612
00:28:35,799 --> 00:28:36,599
Please.

613
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:39,720
Director.

614
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,839
Then I'll excuse myself for now.

615
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:41,880
Go ahead.

616
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:42,920
Director Liang.

617
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:43,799
Please.

618
00:28:46,839 --> 00:28:47,839
Director Liang

619
00:28:47,839 --> 00:28:48,400
Come

620
00:28:48,599 --> 00:28:49,400
Have a seat

621
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:50,799
Director Xie

622
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,200
I heard from Secretary Wang

623
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,799
that you have something to report to me

624
00:28:56,799 --> 00:28:59,440
Team Leader Chen installed surveillance equipment at No. 76 without authorization

625
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:00,839
The director doesn't want to pursue the matter

626
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,559
But I don't want to let him off

627
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,519
Liang Shuo

628
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,240
You're getting bolder and bolder

629
00:29:07,759 --> 00:29:09,960
What makes you say I don't want to pursue it?

630
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:13,759
Forgive my rudeness

631
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,000
What is it?

632
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:17,440
Is there something you can't say?

633
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,559
I dare to ask

634
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,319
All this time

635
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:24,759
How have I performed at No. 76?

636
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,480
You have always been

637
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,839
my most capable subordinate

638
00:29:28,359 --> 00:29:29,519
without exception

639
00:29:29,599 --> 00:29:32,039
Then why has the director never trusted me?

640
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:34,440
What are you talking about?

641
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,039
If the director trusted me

642
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,839
you wouldn't have sent someone to test me

643
00:29:38,119 --> 00:29:40,559
let alone have Team Leader Chen monitor me

644
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:41,599
Nonsense

645
00:29:41,759 --> 00:29:42,799
Chen Gengsheng monitoring you

646
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:44,400
That wasn't my order

647
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,599
And you say I sent someone to test you

648
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,119
That's pure nonsense

649
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:52,759
Disguising as a Chongqing agent to contact you

650
00:29:52,759 --> 00:29:54,440
Wasn't that your instruction?

651
00:29:54,519 --> 00:29:55,599
Of course not

652
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,839
I only found out today

653
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,799
I just learned about this today

654
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,599
So in that case

655
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,359
it was Chen Gengsheng himself

656
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,039
You've blamed the wrong person

657
00:30:14,319 --> 00:30:15,119
That's right.

658
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:16,960
At the banquet that day,

659
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,640
this person was in the restroom

660
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,599
and said a bunch of confusing things to me.

661
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,799
I always thought it was on your orders.

662
00:30:23,359 --> 00:30:24,720
So,

663
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,359
that's why you kept it to yourself.

664
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,559
If the director wanted to investigate me,

665
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:30,599
how would I dare to get involved?

666
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,200
He said he saw through the setup.

667
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:35,400
All I could do was keep my head down and do my job.

668
00:30:41,319 --> 00:30:42,839
Then why

669
00:30:42,839 --> 00:30:44,400
did you and Hirata Noriko

670
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,160
go to

671
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,640
the Lianjia Alley warehouse at that time?

672
00:30:50,759 --> 00:30:51,799
I deserve to be punished.

673
00:30:51,799 --> 00:30:53,400
I tried to be clever with you.

674
00:30:53,839 --> 00:30:54,519
What?

675
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:55,119
Speak.

676
00:30:55,599 --> 00:30:56,759
What I thought was,

677
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,000
as long as I was with Officer Hirata

678
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,559
at that time,

679
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:02,119
she would naturally help clear my name.

680
00:31:03,759 --> 00:31:06,240
Director Liang, you really are cunning.

681
00:31:06,319 --> 00:31:07,640
Such a schemer.

682
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:09,279
Alright then.

683
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:10,400
It was all a misunderstanding.

684
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:12,920
These past two days, because of this matter,

685
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,319
I've been tossing and turning.

686
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,000
It wasn't until just now, when Director Cui

687
00:31:16,279 --> 00:31:18,319
mentioned Chen Gengsheng eavesdropping on me,

688
00:31:18,319 --> 00:31:19,799
that I finally gathered the courage

689
00:31:19,799 --> 00:31:21,119
to ask you for confirmation.

690
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,480
Don't worry.

691
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,319
Once it's confirmed that Chen Gengsheng is anti-Japanese,

692
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:29,240
I'll personally take care of him.

693
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:55,000
Director

694
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:55,720
What do you think?

695
00:31:56,839 --> 00:31:57,640
It seems

696
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,960
we really misunderstood Liang Shuo.

697
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,799
He can be so calm about it.

698
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,680
I really don't think there's anything wrong with Liang Shuo.

699
00:32:04,359 --> 00:32:05,160
You

700
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:06,799
think so too?

701
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:07,480
Yes.

702
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,119
We've been dogs for the Japanese for so many years,

703
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,119
and now even the bone scraps in our mouths

704
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:14,200
are being picked out.

705
00:32:14,519 --> 00:32:15,880
That Hirata and Mizuno

706
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,559
are really going too far.

707
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,799
It seems

708
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:20,319
that dogs who are too loyal

709
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,599
shouldn't even expect a sip of soup.

710
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,440
Please calm your anger.

711
00:32:23,559 --> 00:32:25,359
I will definitely help share your burdens.

712
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,119
The anti-Japanese elements are targeting the Peace Conference directly.

713
00:32:29,559 --> 00:32:30,480
So,

714
00:32:30,599 --> 00:32:32,359
we still need to be cautious.

715
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,400
We absolutely cannot tie our security and leverage

716
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:36,400
to the Japanese.

717
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:37,799
As for Liang Shuo,

718
00:32:38,319 --> 00:32:41,200
he is a key candidate for the Peace Conference's security.

719
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:43,720
We need to investigate him further.

720
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,920
The appointment from the Central Executive Committee

721
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:46,759
has arrived.

722
00:32:46,759 --> 00:32:48,400
It's not that easy.

723
00:32:49,319 --> 00:32:51,000
This Special Inspector position

724
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:52,160
is too delicate.

725
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:55,400
It involves our maneuvering at the Peace Conference,

726
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,720
and also serves as a bridge.

727
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,680
So,

728
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,440
both Chairman Wang and the Japanese

729
00:33:00,519 --> 00:33:03,000
want someone who leans toward their own side.

730
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,119
On our side,

731
00:33:04,119 --> 00:33:05,440
we need Director Ding's approval.

732
00:33:05,559 --> 00:33:06,799
On the Japanese side,

733
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:08,519
it requires Mizuno Nobukage's endorsement.

734
00:33:10,119 --> 00:33:11,759
This is really complicated.

735
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,400
As for this matter,

736
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:14,759
we still need to plan carefully.

737
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,759
I'll also make further suggestions to Director Ding.

738
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:19,359
And another thing,

739
00:33:19,559 --> 00:33:21,200
the person I initially recommended to the higher-ups

740
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,039
was you.

741
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,000
But you,

742
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,319
can't even maintain good relations with the Japanese.

743
00:33:25,799 --> 00:33:26,799
You're disappointing.

744
00:33:27,079 --> 00:33:28,119
It's my own incompetence.

745
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,559
I still prefer

746
00:33:29,559 --> 00:33:30,960
to serve by your side, Director.

747
00:33:44,119 --> 00:33:45,839
If you ever need to contact me urgently,

748
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,359
go to the balcony across from the Special Agent Headquarters

749
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:49,519
and place a pot of orchids there.

750
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:57,799
On the mail route,

751
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,920
an important informant was arrested.

752
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,319
He might reveal

753
00:34:01,319 --> 00:34:03,200
information about the Snow Blind Project.

754
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,799
How much does he know about the operation?

755
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:09,440
Scorpio wants to meet you this afternoon.

756
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,599
Understood.

757
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:12,599
You can go back first.

758
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:13,400
Alright.

759
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,840
You coming to find me on your own

760
00:35:17,639 --> 00:35:18,400
shows

761
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,880
that you have fully accepted

762
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,239
your former identity.

763
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:30,159
Bringing this is to remind me

764
00:35:33,079 --> 00:35:35,159
that this was your previous contact token.

765
00:35:37,039 --> 00:35:38,000
Continuing to use it

766
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,280
is to follow tradition.

767
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,440
More importantly,

768
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,679
the maple leaf

769
00:35:44,159 --> 00:35:45,559
is now my code name.

770
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,079
As per the old rules,

771
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:52,119
a red maple leaf means it's safe.

772
00:35:52,239 --> 00:35:53,360
If it's yellow,

773
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,920
it means the meeting is immediately canceled.

774
00:35:57,719 --> 00:35:58,920
Your safety

775
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,199
is now my responsibility.

776
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:12,880
Our previous relationship was...

777
00:36:15,159 --> 00:36:15,960
Sorry,

778
00:36:17,559 --> 00:36:19,440
I can only vaguely remember some things.

779
00:36:21,719 --> 00:36:22,800
It's all in the past.

780
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,599
You asked for this meeting,

781
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,199
surely not just

782
00:36:28,199 --> 00:36:29,239
to ask about this.

783
00:36:30,519 --> 00:36:31,599
I was just asking.

784
00:36:37,639 --> 00:36:39,039
It's okay if you've forgotten.

785
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,480
Compared to what we're doing now,

786
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,840
it's not that important.

787
00:36:49,679 --> 00:36:50,920
Wang Qiaosu has been arrested.

788
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:52,880
What?

789
00:36:54,199 --> 00:36:55,000
This is bad.

790
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,519
I'm worried now.

791
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:59,559
Does Wang Qiaosu know about you?

792
00:36:59,559 --> 00:37:00,360
That's exactly why

793
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,559
I came to see you urgently.

794
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,480
The Japanese have long suspected

795
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:05,000
there's an undercover agent in Unit 76.

796
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,000
Right now, I don't know

797
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,840
how much inside information Wang Qiaosu actually knows.

798
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,880
But Mizuno Nobukage

799
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,440
will definitely arrange for Wang Qiaosu

800
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,599
to meet with Chen Gengsheng.

801
00:37:13,079 --> 00:37:14,360
If that really happens,

802
00:37:14,559 --> 00:37:15,880
it will be impossible to undo.

803
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,280
If I were Mizuno,

804
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:20,880
I would verify it the same way.

805
00:37:22,159 --> 00:37:23,360
Our advantage is

806
00:37:23,719 --> 00:37:25,320
that in a short time,

807
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:27,199
Wang Qiaosu won't gain Mizuno Nobukage's trust.

808
00:37:27,559 --> 00:37:28,800
As long as we use this to our advantage,

809
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,360
at the critical moment,

810
00:37:30,599 --> 00:37:32,519
we can intensify the Japanese suspicion of Wang Qiaosu.

811
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,079
Then things will take a turn for the better.

812
00:37:36,159 --> 00:37:37,599
You've already figured out what to do?

813
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,840
It might involve some risks.

814
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:40,840
I need help from the organization.

815
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:42,920
Tell me your plan.

816
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,000
I'll report it to the organization.

817
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,000
First,

818
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,920
we need to prevent the two from meeting.

819
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:49,719
At the same time,

820
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,039
we need to fake

821
00:37:51,039 --> 00:37:52,760
a connection between Chen Gengsheng and Wang Qiaosu.

822
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:54,039
Drag Wang Qiaosu into this.

823
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,280
How do we stop it?

824
00:38:07,559 --> 00:38:09,639
No. 76's hesitation about Chen Gengsheng

825
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,440
is also a doubt about me.

826
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,000
I need to regain No. 76's trust.

827
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,920
And resolve the current trouble at the same time.

828
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,280
Eliminate Chen Gengsheng, this cancer.

829
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,320
Why not do it?

830
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,840
I will report it immediately.

831
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:22,440
But

832
00:38:24,239 --> 00:38:25,519
But this plan is too big.

833
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,519
We need to get Xie Jun'an involved.

834
00:38:28,679 --> 00:38:29,480
Don't worry.

835
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,320
I'll go see him right away.

836
00:38:32,119 --> 00:38:33,639
Xie Nianzi has already passed on

837
00:38:33,639 --> 00:38:35,119
the message that Scorpio wants to see me.

838
00:38:36,679 --> 00:38:38,239
You told me before

839
00:38:38,239 --> 00:38:39,679
about Miss Xie's situation.

840
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,599
The organization already knows.

841
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,320
You don't need to worry.

842
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,079
Okay.

843
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:48,840
Liang,

844
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,239
Comrade Qingshuang,

845
00:38:54,199 --> 00:38:55,360
you must be careful.

846
00:39:03,199 --> 00:39:03,880
By the way,

847
00:39:04,039 --> 00:39:05,679
you said something wrong just now.

848
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,280
What?

849
00:39:10,559 --> 00:39:11,079
You said that now

850
00:39:11,079 --> 00:39:13,079
I've completely accepted my identity.

851
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:15,920
Actually, I haven't.

852
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,119
I still just want to live a good life.

853
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,760
The reason I'm willing to come see you,

854
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,559
whether it's Maple Leaf

855
00:39:23,559 --> 00:39:24,320
or you,

856
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,800
is simply because thinking of you

857
00:39:27,559 --> 00:39:29,360
makes me feel familiar and at ease.

858
00:39:34,119 --> 00:39:36,119
If this is something Maple Leaf must accomplish,

859
00:39:37,079 --> 00:39:38,480
I'm willing to do it for him.

860
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,559
This is what I owe him,

861
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,920
and also, as I am now,

862
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,559
my own choice.

863
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:18,760
Mr. Wang

864
00:40:19,239 --> 00:40:20,159
I heard

865
00:40:20,159 --> 00:40:21,960
your Japanese is quite good.

866
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:24,280
Yes.

867
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:25,760
In the eleventh year of the Taisho era,

868
00:40:26,559 --> 00:40:28,119
I studied abroad in Japan.

869
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,039
I see.

870
00:40:33,719 --> 00:40:34,360
Mr. Wang,

871
00:40:35,559 --> 00:40:37,960
have you ever been in prison?

872
00:40:39,559 --> 00:40:40,320
No.

873
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,320
Never.

874
00:40:43,679 --> 00:40:45,719
What a coincidence.

875
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,840
It's my first time too.

876
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:52,920
First time for what?

877
00:40:56,159 --> 00:40:58,599
Where should we start?

878
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,800
How do you play this?

879
00:41:32,599 --> 00:41:33,320
Sir,

880
00:41:39,559 --> 00:41:40,280
give it a try.
