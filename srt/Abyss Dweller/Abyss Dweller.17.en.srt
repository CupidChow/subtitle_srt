1
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:56,640
Director Liang

2
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,280
Director Liang

3
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,680
Director Liang, Director Liang

4
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,400
Let me tell you, you finally came back.

5
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:04,760
Let me tell you, something big has happened.

6
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,159
That Japanese woman named Hirata—

7
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:06,840
I know.

8
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:08,599
Have the Director and Chief Cui arrived?

9
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:09,800
They have.

10
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,680
They're waiting for you in the office.

11
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,039
Alright, I'll go over right now.

12
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:24,560
Our own car,

13
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,680
our own people,

14
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,759
and something like this could actually happen.

15
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:29,280
If word gets out,

16
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,479
everyone will think it's absurd.

17
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:32,599
I heard that Director Zhou from the committee

18
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:34,199
even called specifically to ask about it.

19
00:02:35,719 --> 00:02:36,960
With such a major incident,

20
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:38,800
the higher-ups naturally have to make a show of it.

21
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:40,000
Otherwise,

22
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,400
how would they explain it to the Japanese?

23
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,319
I just received some news.

24
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:45,560
Director,

25
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:47,719
how did Chief Hirata die?

26
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:49,960
She was on her way

27
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,360
to the army hospital

28
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,120
when she was shot and killed.

29
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,520
There were three people in total.

30
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,680
Besides her,

31
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,439
there was a driver and an adjutant.

32
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,560
All of them were killed.

33
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:01,560
Didn't you go to the scene?

34
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,199
Yes.

35
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,080
That adjutant

36
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,520
was killed at close range with a knife-like weapon.

37
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,039
As for Hirata and the driver,

38
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:08,080
they were at close range

39
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,479
and were shot dead with a pistol.

40
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,759
I'm wondering

41
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,360
how these anti-Japanese elements

42
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:15,759
managed to get so close to her.

43
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:17,240
It was an inside job.

44
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,759
That's what I think too.

45
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:20,919
I just don't know

46
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,560
who this Hirata Kiko

47
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,120
was riding with at the time.

48
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:30,800
Sorry to interrupt, Chief.

49
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:32,319
Mr. Lu has arrived.

50
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,759
Ten years ago

51
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:45,479
At a banquet for a high-ranking official in Shanghai

52
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:46,479
I met her

53
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,960
She came from an ordinary background

54
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,000
But her

55
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,280
ability to read people

56
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:52,319
truly impressed me

57
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:54,680
I recommended her to General Doihara

58
00:03:55,159 --> 00:03:56,479
and sent her to Dong Jing

59
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:58,280
to learn espionage skills

60
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,360
I never expected

61
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,759
that just after completing her studies

62
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:03,840
she would meet such an untimely end

63
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:06,000
It truly makes one angry

64
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:08,680
Miss Hirata was exceptionally capable

65
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:10,960
For such an accident to happen so suddenly

66
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,240
was truly unexpected

67
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:20,839
Mr. Lu,

68
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:23,160
I'd like to hear your opinion.

69
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,160
I've already sent people to the military police.

70
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,720
And to investigate the crime scene as well.

71
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,439
Also,

72
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,519
at the same time,

73
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:29,120
by the Dashui Bridge,

74
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,000
the bodies of Yagi Ryo and three others were found.

75
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,199
Didn't the Military Statistics Bureau just suffer a major blow?

76
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,399
How could they still have so much power?

77
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:38,439
It might not be the Military Statistics Bureau.

78
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,639
These days,

79
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:42,079
the Communists are also very active.

80
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,360
These two assassinations

81
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,959
happened almost at the same time.

82
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:46,439
I've also sent people to Yagi Ryo's case.

83
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,839
Hopefully, they can find

84
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:49,120
the exact spot along the river where he was shot.

85
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:51,600
The military police are also conducting their own investigation.

86
00:04:51,879 --> 00:04:53,000
The Central Executive Committee suspects

87
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,800
that some spies have infiltrated.

88
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:57,600
They probably colluded with anti-Japanese elements inside and out.

89
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,240
That's what led to this tragedy.

90
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,319
Liang Shuo,

91
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,759
what do you think?

92
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:05,120
According to the investigation results,

93
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:08,360
Miss Hirata was shot and killed at close range.

94
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,120
This rules out

95
00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:14,079
the possibility of a sudden attack by anti-Japanese elements.

96
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:16,319
It must have been someone close to her.

97
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:18,319
Within the Special Operations Headquarters,

98
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,439
is there any suspect?

99
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:21,839
We can't determine that yet.

100
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:23,040
After all, Miss Hirata

101
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,839
hadn't returned to headquarters for two days.

102
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,360
Her whereabouts were highly confidential.

103
00:05:28,839 --> 00:05:30,800
In theory, they shouldn't have been leaked.

104
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:33,079
Mr. Lu,

105
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:34,199
what's your view?

106
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,439
Based on my guess,

107
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:39,920
the person who assassinated Miss Hirata

108
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:42,720
is very likely the one we're looking for.

109
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:45,879
In the Japanese military police,

110
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:47,360
there are a few who are highly skilled,

111
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,639
there are indeed a few.

112
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:50,839
But to pull off something this ruthless,

113
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:52,399
it's hard to say.

114
00:05:56,079 --> 00:05:58,839
Investigating the people around Hirata Kiko

115
00:05:58,839 --> 00:06:00,439
is the right approach.

116
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:03,000
But we must not limit ourselves to just the military police.

117
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,199
Hirata Kiko died very suddenly.

118
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,360
What does this indicate?

119
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,720
It suggests the killer had a compelling reason to kill her.

120
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:11,120
That's very likely.

121
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:14,040
This undercover agent was about to be exposed.

122
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,160
That's why they were forced to act.

123
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,199
I think you should look into

124
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:22,079
who Hirata Kiko was investigating

125
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:24,439
before she died.

126
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:27,120
Yes.

127
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,040
Yes.

128
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,240
I'll look into it right away.

129
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,319
You're awake.

130
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,199
Here.

131
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,360
Thank you.

132
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,839
Sister Man.

133
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,319
Where is Liang Shuo?

134
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:02,560
He went back.

135
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,439
Hirata Kiko is dead.

136
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:05,560
Inside No. 76,

137
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,040
it's already in complete chaos.

138
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:09,680
Just in time, take your medicine.

139
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,600
Nothing happened, right?

140
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:22,199
Don't worry.

141
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:25,680
That's true.

142
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,600
I was being silly.

143
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:30,120
Sister Man, you're such a good shot,

144
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,079
and you're beautiful,

145
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:33,399
smart and capable.

146
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:34,839
With you handling things,

147
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:36,240
what could possibly go wrong?

148
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:40,079
You really know how to compliment people.

149
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,879
Here, take your medicine first.

150
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:45,879
Sister Man,

151
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,680
I'm just telling the truth.

152
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,920
You...

153
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,360
Don't you want to ask anything else?

154
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,560
You were the ones who saved me.

155
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:18,720
I'm really grateful.

156
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,680
I know you have your rules.

157
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:23,279
If I ask too much, it wouldn't be fair to you.

158
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,399
What are your plans next?

159
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:27,879
To be honest,

160
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,199
I don't know either.

161
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:31,360
I don't know where my future path leads.

162
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,240
But I just hope

163
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,399
I can truly help Liang Shuo.

164
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,000
Nian Ci

165
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:03,440
No matter which path you take,

166
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:06,000
as long as you follow your heart,

167
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:10,159
Liang Shuo said the same thing.

168
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,639
At this time,

169
00:09:13,879 --> 00:09:16,120
identity and answers don't matter.

170
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,480
Maybe you’re right.

171
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:22,559
Sister Man,

172
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,519
can you do me a favor?

173
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,279
Take me back.

174
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,240
Where do you want to go?

175
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:36,720
Before he died, Hirata already suspected my relationship with Liang Shuo.

176
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,039
If I don’t show up there for a long time,

177
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,559
I’m afraid it will cause trouble for Liang Shuo.

178
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,399
Something so serious has happened.

179
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:48,840
The Japanese military police are already in that area

180
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,399
and have started a thorough search.

181
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:52,039
I advise you not to go back yet.

182
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:53,080
No.

183
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,519
I have to go back.

184
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,399
Even though Hirata is dead,

185
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,000
Cui Mo still knows me.

186
00:09:58,159 --> 00:10:00,080
If I don’t show up for a long time,

187
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,480
they’ll eventually investigate there.

188
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:03,480
It will cause trouble for Liang Shuo.

189
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,200
Please take me back.

190
00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:14,600
If that’s the case,

191
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,960
rest well today.

192
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,240
I’ll make some preparations.

193
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:20,519
I’ll take you back tomorrow.

194
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:20,679
I’ll take you back tomorrow.

195
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:22,000
Okay.

196
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,480
Thank you.

197
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,159
Liang Shuo

198
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,320
Why are you in such a hurry?

199
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,519
There are so many things to deal with.

200
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,240
Just thinking about it gives me a headache.

201
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,679
And now this thing with Hirata Noriko happened.

202
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,320
I'm a newly appointed director.

203
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,480
I haven't even found my footing yet.

204
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,919
And now I've got a mess to clean up.

205
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:42,799
How could I not be anxious?

206
00:10:43,159 --> 00:10:43,960
Busy as I am,

207
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:45,639
about this matter,

208
00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:46,960
I really need your help.

209
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,519
Hirata Noriko only favored you.

210
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:51,799
Give me some clues.

211
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:53,799
You're joking, Brother Cui.

212
00:10:54,679 --> 00:10:56,559
Director Hirata did help me get promoted,

213
00:10:56,559 --> 00:10:57,480
she gave me a push,

214
00:10:57,759 --> 00:10:59,440
but she wasn't completely open with me.

215
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,799
She didn't tell me everything.

216
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:02,440
Besides,

217
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:03,559
when it comes to you, Brother Cui,

218
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,919
if I had any clues,

219
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:06,600
why would I keep them from you?

220
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,519
Didn't the chief say

221
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,080
we should investigate

222
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,200
what Hirata was looking into before she died?

223
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,240
For example,

224
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:15,360
the people around us,

225
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:16,360
who they are.

226
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,240
If you put it that way, Brother Cui,

227
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:22,480
I really don't dare to respond.

228
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,080
Yes, Director Hirata did suspect me.

229
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,519
But wasn't the misunderstanding cleared up quickly?

230
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:29,679
Besides,

231
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:31,240
after she came to the Special Operations Headquarters,

232
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:32,679
who didn't have doubts?

233
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,159
Including you, Brother Cui.

234
00:11:35,559 --> 00:11:36,679
The personnel files

235
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:38,039
were all thoroughly searched by her, weren't they?

236
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,200
If you ask me,

237
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,320
we still need to start from the scene of the incident.

238
00:11:42,759 --> 00:11:43,799
Divide the area into sections

239
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:44,759
and investigate them one by one.

240
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,799
For now,

241
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:48,000
that's all we can do.

242
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,080
How are your injuries?

243
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,320
Just flesh wounds.

244
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,039
It's nothing serious.

245
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,559
But speaking of which,

246
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:59,399
I really didn't have the strength to kill anyone yesterday.

247
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,799
That sounded pretty sarcastic.

248
00:12:04,919 --> 00:12:06,279
You shouldn't have come today.

249
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:07,759
It would have been better to rest at home.

250
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:09,279
Alright.

251
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:09,919
There's still one more this afternoon.

252
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:11,519
The inauguration for Hirata's successor.

253
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,720
You don't need to drive.

254
00:12:12,759 --> 00:12:13,919
Come with me in my car.

255
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:15,720
Okay.

256
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,200
Thanks for looking after me, Brother Cui.

257
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,240
Once things settle down,

258
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,600
come home with me for a visit.

259
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:21,000
You got hurt.

260
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:22,360
Your sister-in-law has been worried about you.

261
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,039
Also,

262
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:25,120
about you and Miss Xie,

263
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,399
she should know about it by now.

264
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,759
Sure.

265
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,159
It's been a long time since I had her cooking.

266
00:12:31,159 --> 00:12:31,440
It's been a long time since I had her cooking.

267
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:33,399
I'll get back to work, then.

268
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,000
We've made it through the hardest times.

269
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,120
The beautiful sight of cherry blossoms in full bloom,

270
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,480
you'll never see it again.

271
00:12:57,159 --> 00:12:58,759
What a pity.

272
00:12:58,759 --> 00:13:01,159
Hirata's spirit is with me.

273
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,240
Rest in peace.

274
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,679
Director Takagi has arrived.

275
00:13:48,679 --> 00:13:49,559
Do you know why I

276
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:51,320
asked you to play chess with me at this time?

277
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:55,039
I think it's a test from you, Chief.

278
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,720
Your Chinese is quite good.

279
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,120
My uncle asked me to learn Chinese from a young age.

280
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,240
He said

281
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,279
if you want to take over the Chinese territory,

282
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,679
you have to learn to use their tools.

283
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:06,960
About

284
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,879
the death of Hirata Kiko,

285
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,360
you should already know about it.

286
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:14,279
I want to hear your thoughts.

287
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,039
When Hirata was killed,

288
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:22,159
Yagi Ryo was also ambushed.

289
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,039
Looking at it now,

290
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:27,000
the opponent's timing,

291
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,799
their attack and retreat,

292
00:14:29,799 --> 00:14:31,480
and the way they wrapped things up were all well-organized.

293
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:32,720
She really

294
00:14:33,399 --> 00:14:35,519
ran into a truly formidable

295
00:14:36,039 --> 00:14:37,399
opponent.

296
00:14:41,879 --> 00:14:42,879
I always thought

297
00:14:43,159 --> 00:14:45,360
you had extraordinary self-control.

298
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:47,360
But it seems even you can't avoid being affected.

299
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:50,039
You're the one who can't avoid it, aren't you?

300
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,600
Where did you just come back from?

301
00:14:52,039 --> 00:14:53,679
I heard something about the Mei Agency.

302
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,399
That has nothing to do with you.

303
00:14:55,919 --> 00:14:57,759
We just got into trouble together.

304
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,679
Isn't it a bit late to distance yourself now?

305
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,559
Are you threatening me?

306
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,240
You're exaggerating.

307
00:15:06,759 --> 00:15:08,000
I know Mr. Lu's pistol

308
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,480
is always loaded.

309
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:11,600
I have no need to fight you to the bitter end.

310
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:15,799
Your weapons are advanced,

311
00:15:15,799 --> 00:15:17,440
and your plans are thorough.

312
00:15:18,279 --> 00:15:19,159
I

313
00:15:19,159 --> 00:15:22,159
originally thought that after severely damaging the Shanghai station of the Bureau of Investigation and Statistics,

314
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:27,080
I could rest easy for a while.

315
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,159
I underestimated the enemy.

316
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,679
Mr. Mizuno, you don't need to take it to heart.

317
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,679
The assassin must be

318
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,720
someone close to Hirata who knows him inside out.

319
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,759
I checked with the military police.

320
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:39,960
There are no suspects for now.

321
00:15:40,679 --> 00:15:43,840
It can only be

322
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,480
that group from the Special Operations Headquarters.

323
00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:49,120
Something went wrong.

324
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:52,480
I'm not like Hirata.

325
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:55,200
When it comes to that group,

326
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,000
I've never trusted them.

327
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:58,480
Takagi,

328
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,200
are you really ready?

329
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:04,039
I'm willing to share your burdens.

330
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:05,840
Hirata's death

331
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,559
has already alarmed Mizuno.

332
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,159
Aren't you thinking of taking quick action to fix things?

333
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:11,080
Yet you came to see me.

334
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,679
Are you unusually confident,

335
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,360
or just overconfident?

336
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:18,840
The situation is critical.

337
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:20,200
Even if I try to fix things,

338
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:22,799
I need to know who around me is friend or foe.

339
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:23,600
After all,

340
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,320
an open attack is easy to avoid,

341
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,759
but a hidden threat is hard to guard against.

342
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:31,080
Then take a good look.

343
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:34,799
I won't condemn fickle people all at once.

344
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,279
Because I know

345
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,600
they always have some

346
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,879
reasons why they have to be fickle.

347
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,279
Then there's even less need to explain to you.

348
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:49,639
Let me guess.

349
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,480
Is it that Scorpio still won't let you come clean with me?

350
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,000
You really know how to joke.

351
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,000
Director Lu.

352
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,440
Boss.

353
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,880
I've been looking for you for a while.

354
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:15,920
You are...

355
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,279
Got it.

356
00:17:22,279 --> 00:17:23,000
Go ahead.

357
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,200
You're very young.

358
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,039
And you have your uncle's support.

359
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,880
You're also a standout among the younger generation in the military.

360
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,519
But that's still not enough.

361
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:37,480
You must grow up even faster.

362
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:40,680
Are you asking me

363
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:45,240
to take over Hirata's position?

364
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:47,240
I've said this much and you still don't get it.

365
00:17:54,119 --> 00:17:56,160
There's something else I need to warn you about.

366
00:17:58,599 --> 00:17:59,799
No matter when,

367
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,200
you must never let your guard down.

368
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,119
And never underestimate your enemies.

369
00:18:22,119 --> 00:18:23,640
Mr. Mizuno's chess skills

370
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,880
are outstanding.

371
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,359
I admit my defeat wholeheartedly.

372
00:18:27,079 --> 00:18:29,519
You understand what I mean now.

373
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,000
Go get ready.

374
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,359
Yes, sir.

375
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,160
This was custom-made specifically for Mr. Lu.

376
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,640
Are you mocking me, Mr. Lu?

377
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:50,359
Humiliation can become a driving force in life.

378
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:52,079
Mr. Lu, perhaps you could see it as

379
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:53,279
a well-intentioned reminder.

380
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:54,200
A constant reminder to yourself

381
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,039
of why you ended up in this situation,

382
00:18:56,039 --> 00:18:58,119
and how you can endure hardship to make a comeback.

383
00:18:58,119 --> 00:18:59,400
To wash away the shame,

384
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:10,880
stand up again,

385
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,079
stand up again,

386
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,440
and try once more.

387
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,400
I won't write off people who are unpredictable.

388
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:26,880
Because I know

389
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,200
they always have

390
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,559
reasons why they have to be unpredictable.

391
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,039
Director Lu.

392
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,440
Director Lu.

393
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:26,680
Chief Takagi

394
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,039
Congratulations.

395
00:20:30,759 --> 00:20:32,599
I need to prepare for the inauguration ceremony.

396
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:35,039
Notify the Special Agent Headquarters to attend.

397
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:35,640
Yes, sir.

398
00:20:58,519 --> 00:20:59,240
Hello?

399
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:00,200
Hello?

400
00:21:00,839 --> 00:21:01,599
It's me.

401
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:03,720
Mizuno.

402
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:04,880
Good work.

403
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:06,440
I'm not sure if there will be results in the short term.

404
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,200
But his prideful nature

405
00:21:08,759 --> 00:21:09,920
could become an obstacle to his success.

406
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,759
Yuuji.

407
00:21:12,039 --> 00:21:13,359
This kid may not have Hirata's

408
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,119
shrewdness,

409
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,359
but

410
00:21:16,359 --> 00:21:18,400
compared to Hirata's indecisiveness,

411
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,440
he is much more decisive.

412
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,640
If we put him

413
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,759
in the Special Operations Headquarters,

414
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:25,599
I think it will have unexpected results.

415
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,160
Mr. Takagi,

416
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:29,759
you have a lot of confidence in your nephew.

417
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,039
As for him,

418
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,839
he was the right choice from the start.

419
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:35,000
Right now,

420
00:21:35,319 --> 00:21:36,920
we don't have the energy

421
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,720
to be distracted by infiltrators in the Special Operations Headquarters.

422
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,799
Besides,

423
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:41,720
the Peace Conference is approaching.

424
00:21:42,279 --> 00:21:45,920
Our Trinity Plan is finally about to begin.

425
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:48,680
Director.

426
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,359
Come in.

427
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:52,880
Director.

428
00:21:53,079 --> 00:21:54,519
Chief Liang was just about to drive away.

429
00:21:54,519 --> 00:21:55,160
Has he left?

430
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:55,839
No, he hasn't.

431
00:21:55,839 --> 00:21:56,759
He came back again.

432
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:58,640
Director.

433
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:00,720
Is there really something wrong with Chief Liang?

434
00:22:04,039 --> 00:22:05,640
After Hirata Xizi was attacked,

435
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:08,079
it's not that I didn't have suspicions.

436
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,839
At the army hospital,

437
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:10,920
he and Hirata Xizi

438
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,680
were still at odds with each other.

439
00:22:14,119 --> 00:22:16,039
Then Hirata Xizi was attacked.

440
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:17,640
That's the first suspicious point.

441
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,880
The second suspicious point is Miss Xie.

442
00:22:22,359 --> 00:22:24,240
From what I know about Hirata Xizi,

443
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,319
she would never overlook this clue.

444
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,599
Has Tonghai returned?

445
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:30,839
Not yet.

446
00:22:30,839 --> 00:22:32,000
But it should be soon.

447
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,039
By the way, Director,

448
00:22:33,079 --> 00:22:34,839
the inauguration ceremony is about to start.

449
00:22:34,839 --> 00:22:36,799
The chief asked you and Director Liang to go there immediately.

450
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:42,440
The key person for the plan has been found.

451
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:44,839
He's truly a very stubborn

452
00:22:44,839 --> 00:22:46,839
and rather unpleasant old man.

453
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:50,960
His approach to carrying out the plan is at odds with the military's.

454
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,440
If his record weren't spotless,

455
00:22:54,839 --> 00:22:57,880
I'd even doubt his loyalty to the Empire.

456
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,880
That almost sounds like you're talking about yourself.

457
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,319
I still have to remind you,

458
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:09,279
that old guy is a veteran agent.

459
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:11,880
If he's working with us,

460
00:23:12,519 --> 00:23:14,839
he must have his own agenda.

461
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:15,960
It doesn't matter.

462
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,119
When it comes to me,

463
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,079
he'll have to follow my lead.

464
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:28,559
The car is here.

465
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,319
Is it this car?

466
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,319
Is this Mr. Liang's car?

467
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,000
Yes, yes.

468
00:23:42,039 --> 00:23:43,160
It's Mr. Liang.

469
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:43,920
Director Liang.

470
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:44,640
The military police unit was attacked.

471
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,799
Was it a security oversight?

472
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,319
Mr. Liang.

473
00:23:46,319 --> 00:23:47,079
This violent incident—

474
00:23:47,079 --> 00:23:48,559
Will it affect relations between China and Japan?

475
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:49,839
As the newly appointed Deputy Director of the Special Investigation Department,

476
00:23:49,839 --> 00:23:51,599
are you planning to improve public security?

477
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:52,720
Mr. Wang Jingwei's path to peace—

478
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,400
Everyone,

479
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:55,720
Director Liang is in a hurry today.

480
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,559
He doesn't have time for interviews.

481
00:23:57,559 --> 00:23:58,200
Let's do this another day.

482
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:58,960
Thank you, everyone.

483
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:00,039
Please make way, please.

484
00:24:00,079 --> 00:24:00,960
Mr. Liang! Mr. Liang! Mr. Liang!

485
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:01,839
Please say something, Mr. Liang.

486
00:24:01,839 --> 00:24:02,359
Salute.

487
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:03,519
Mr. Liang.

488
00:24:04,039 --> 00:24:04,599
At ease.

489
00:24:11,839 --> 00:24:12,559
Brother Liang,

490
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:14,200
you're quite

491
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,400
like a big celebrity on the Bund these days.

492
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:17,440
How do you feel about it?

493
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,920
Brother Cui, don't tease me.

494
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,519
Fame brings trouble.

495
00:24:20,839 --> 00:24:22,240
Especially in our line of work.

496
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,440
Exposure is the last thing we want.

497
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,640
Hirata Noriko is a prime example.

498
00:24:26,519 --> 00:24:28,400
With anti-Japanese activists so rampant now,

499
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,680
who knows,

500
00:24:30,119 --> 00:24:32,279
maybe my head won't stay on my shoulders one day.

501
00:24:32,279 --> 00:24:32,960
Pah, pah, pah!

502
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:34,240
Don't talk nonsense.

503
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,680
That's the last thing we should talk about.

504
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,480
Enter No. 76.

505
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,480
Only as a last resort

506
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,319
can the secret mailbox be activated.

507
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:43,559
Follow the car in front.

508
00:25:43,559 --> 00:25:44,079
Hurry.

509
00:25:56,839 --> 00:25:57,559
I heard

510
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:00,359
Mizuno Shingen arranged for an official's son

511
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:02,160
to take over Hirata Kiko's position.

512
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:03,720
Look at that.

513
00:26:04,359 --> 00:26:06,599
This is quite a big scene.

514
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,079
Looks like it's an old acquaintance.

515
00:26:15,559 --> 00:26:16,480
Director Liang.

516
00:26:18,839 --> 00:26:21,319
Didn't expect to meet you here.

517
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,200
Director Cui is here too.

518
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:26,599
We were just talking

519
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:29,119
about who the capable and virtuous person would be

520
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:30,759
to succeed Director Hirata.

521
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,720
Didn't expect it to be Mr. Takagi.

522
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:34,119
Mr. Takagi.

523
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,519
Congratulations.

524
00:26:36,119 --> 00:26:37,319
Congratulations.

525
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,519
I'm afraid my appointment

526
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
won't make everyone happy.

527
00:26:51,519 --> 00:26:52,599
Judging by your face,

528
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:55,279
you don't look like someone who'll live long.

529
00:27:00,039 --> 00:27:00,680
Teacher.

530
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:06,799
It's not about Junior Sister Xie.

531
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,200
It's a secret letter from Geluoxi Road.

532
00:27:16,839 --> 00:27:18,319
You've really grown bold.

533
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:21,799
You actually acted on your own and killed Hirata Kiko.

534
00:27:23,079 --> 00:27:25,160
You truly are my outstanding student.

535
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:26,279
It was Senior Brother Lu who did it.

536
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:29,039
He said he had no choice but to act.

537
00:27:29,759 --> 00:27:31,400
Because Nian Ci was under suspicion.

538
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,240
Hirata Kiko tortured her.

539
00:27:34,039 --> 00:27:34,839
So he killed Hirata.

540
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,160
It was all so rushed.

541
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,640
How could he have done it alone?

542
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,839
He did it together with Liang Shuo.

543
00:27:39,519 --> 00:27:40,960
Liang Shuo found out his identity.

544
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,079
This is utter nonsense.

545
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:46,839
They completely ignored my words.

546
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,039
They acted first and reported later.

547
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,160
Do they even see me as their teacher anymore?

548
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:52,880
Get ready.

549
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,720
We're meeting Lu Xijian tonight.

550
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,400
Hirata just died.

551
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,640
It's a sensitive time right now.

552
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,759
He said he has important information to report to me.

553
00:28:00,039 --> 00:28:01,000
No matter how dangerous it is,

554
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:02,400
we have to push through.

555
00:28:03,839 --> 00:28:05,920
It's an honor.

556
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,680
It's a privilege.

557
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:09,920
But it's also a lot of pressure.

558
00:28:10,519 --> 00:28:11,920
Right now, the situation in Shanghai

559
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,880
has reached a critical and unstable point.

560
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:17,000
My predecessor, Chief Hirata,

561
00:28:18,039 --> 00:28:21,440
was just assassinated.

562
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,240
But

563
00:28:23,759 --> 00:28:25,759
for me,

564
00:28:26,279 --> 00:28:27,960
this is a new beginning.

565
00:28:28,359 --> 00:28:29,880
A new challenge.

566
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:34,000
A new opportunity.

567
00:28:35,359 --> 00:28:40,359
I feel like I'm back at the military academy.

568
00:28:40,359 --> 00:28:42,559
Getting ready to face a big test.

569
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:46,519
So the top priority right now

570
00:28:46,519 --> 00:28:52,519
is to root out these hateful traitors.

571
00:28:52,519 --> 00:28:53,720
In the future,

572
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,079
in my work,

573
00:28:55,599 --> 00:28:56,880
I will fulfill my duties,

574
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,000
work diligently,

575
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:00,799
and stay grounded.

576
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:04,119
I will give my all to ensure I do not fail my mission.

577
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,880
We've found Miss Xie's residence.

578
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,440
Tonghai is already watching the place.

579
00:29:18,039 --> 00:29:19,200
Take a few more men with you.

580
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,400
Keep a close watch on her.

581
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,480
I'll be there soon.

582
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,480
Alright, understood.

583
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,960
Everything is finally tidied up.

584
00:29:52,359 --> 00:29:53,680
Everything has been restored to its place.

585
00:29:56,599 --> 00:29:57,880
Thank you so much, Sister Man.

586
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:01,079
I've asked around the neighborhood.

587
00:30:01,319 --> 00:30:02,799
The reason you used to live here

588
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:03,359
was also because

589
00:30:03,359 --> 00:30:05,000
everyone here works the night shift, right?

590
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,839
Luckily, none of them were here when it happened.

591
00:30:12,359 --> 00:30:13,480
So we're still relatively safe.

592
00:30:19,759 --> 00:30:21,799
If Number 76 gets suspicious of you,

593
00:30:21,799 --> 00:30:23,799
just say your stomach hurts so much you can't get out of bed.

594
00:30:27,839 --> 00:30:29,559
Here are the prescription and medicine from the hospital.

595
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,839
I'll put them in the drawer for you.

596
00:30:32,279 --> 00:30:32,880
Sister Man,

597
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:34,519
you're really thoughtful.

598
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:38,920
It's for safety.

599
00:30:39,319 --> 00:30:40,119
It's what I should do.

600
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,640
What you need to do now is get some good rest.

601
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,759
Listen to me.

602
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:44,359
Go to sleep.

603
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:45,480
Okay.

604
00:30:46,079 --> 00:30:46,799
I'm leaving now.

605
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:31,799
Who is it?

606
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,480
Who’s there?

607
00:31:38,319 --> 00:31:38,920
Sister Man.

608
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:40,319
Why are you back again?

609
00:31:40,319 --> 00:31:41,440
You’re being watched.

610
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:42,720
I can’t leave either.

611
00:31:43,839 --> 00:31:44,720
What should we do then?

612
00:31:46,079 --> 00:31:47,559
Let’s hope they’re only watching.

613
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,559
I’ll wait until tonight to find a chance to leave.

614
00:31:58,759 --> 00:31:59,640
It’s Liang Shuo.

615
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,440
This is the knock pattern we agreed on.

616
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:14,720
Why are you here?

617
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:15,759
There are spies downstairs.

618
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:16,799
They all work for Cui Mo.

619
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,279
Cui Mo has seen me before.

620
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,240
I shouldn’t be here.

621
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,119
You can only stay here for now.

622
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,480
You can’t go anywhere.

623
00:32:28,119 --> 00:32:29,160
Better to die with honor

624
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,440
than to live in disgrace.

625
00:32:31,119 --> 00:32:32,440
At least I can’t drag you all down with me.

626
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:49,799
Everything is arranged.

627
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:50,799
It’s all set.

628
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:51,319
Director.

629
00:32:51,599 --> 00:32:52,440
What’s the plan?

630
00:32:52,839 --> 00:32:53,799
Hold your position.

631
00:32:54,359 --> 00:32:55,839
Come upstairs with me to take a look.

632
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:56,720
Yes.

633
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,319
We’re all brothers here.

634
00:32:59,559 --> 00:33:00,920
Let’s hope this doesn’t get ugly.

635
00:33:05,839 --> 00:33:06,440
Director.

636
00:33:07,559 --> 00:33:08,559
Here.

637
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,240
Director.

638
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,519
That room.

639
00:33:39,359 --> 00:33:40,319
Hide in the closet.

640
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:41,880
But they...

641
00:33:42,119 --> 00:33:42,839
We can only take a gamble.

642
00:33:42,839 --> 00:33:44,720
Bet that he hasn’t found any real evidence against me.

643
00:33:45,319 --> 00:33:45,759
Come.

644
00:33:46,599 --> 00:33:47,400
Stand to the left.

645
00:34:07,319 --> 00:34:08,159
Brother Liang,

646
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:09,920
why are you back?

647
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:10,960
Brother Cui,

648
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,559
what brings you here?

649
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:13,280
I thought

650
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,320
I was the only one who slipped out of the venue.

651
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,079
As for me,

652
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:17,079
I heard from others

653
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,599
that your wife wasn't feeling well.

654
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,920
So I hurried over to check on her.

655
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:21,440
You’re really quick.

656
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:23,440
Brother Cui, your news travels even faster.

657
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:24,559
Indeed,

658
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,119
Yuxin is feeling a bit unwell.

659
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:27,480
So I sneaked back

660
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,519
to look after her.

661
00:34:29,079 --> 00:34:30,119
Sorry to trouble you.

662
00:34:30,119 --> 00:34:31,239
No need to be so polite.

663
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:32,320
Delun,

664
00:34:33,079 --> 00:34:34,639
check if Miss Xie’s things

665
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:36,639
were all left in the car.

666
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:37,719
Yes,

667
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:38,880
I’ll go get them right away.

668
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:40,880
Brother

669
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:42,679
Let me see your wife.

670
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:43,440
Of course.

671
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:44,400
Please come in.

672
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:45,880
Is that Brother Cui?

673
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:47,039
It's me.

674
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:48,920
Brother Cui.

675
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:49,719
I'm really sorry.

676
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:50,840
I'm not feeling well.

677
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:51,239
Sister-in-law.

678
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:52,039
Sorry for the intrusion.

679
00:34:52,519 --> 00:34:53,480
What's wrong with you?

680
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:54,480
A sudden illness.

681
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,519
My gastritis flared up again.

682
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,760
That's a problem with eating habits.

683
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,039
Your wife is from Wuxi.

684
00:34:59,039 --> 00:35:00,559
She doesn't eat spicy food like people from Chongqing, right?

685
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:01,880
She likes spicy food, doesn't she?

686
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:04,639
Brother Cui.

687
00:35:05,639 --> 00:35:07,679
Why does that sound a bit odd?

688
00:35:08,719 --> 00:35:10,079
It sounds like there's a hidden meaning.

689
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:11,000
Look at you.

690
00:35:11,079 --> 00:35:12,679
I'm just concerned about your wife.

691
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:15,199
Don't be so sensitive.

692
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:25,719
Chicken soup.

693
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,199
Chicken soup is good.

694
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,119
It's nourishing.

695
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:29,639
Brother.

696
00:35:30,119 --> 00:35:31,719
You're really good to your wife.

697
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,000
It's just this room...

698
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,679
It's a bit unfair to your wife.

699
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:42,280
It's too old.

700
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,760
This furniture...

701
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,519
Shouldn't it be replaced too?

702
00:35:44,519 --> 00:35:45,199
Brother Cui.

703
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:55,119
You suspect I'm hiding someone in this cabinet, don't you?

704
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:01,960
You should've said so earlier.

705
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:04,719
If you want to open it,

706
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,360
just do it directly.

707
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,800
Liang Shuo, it's all my clothes in there.

708
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,119
What are you doing?

709
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:16,280
I'm not here to investigate.

710
00:36:16,519 --> 00:36:18,400
We're good brothers, right?

711
00:36:18,599 --> 00:36:19,519
You suspect me?

712
00:36:19,519 --> 00:36:21,039
No need to beat around the bush.

713
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:22,000
Let me tell you,

714
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,320
Today, you have to get to the bottom of this for me.

715
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,000
Investigate thoroughly.

716
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:26,599
No, no, no.

717
00:36:26,599 --> 00:36:28,039
These are Yuxin's personal clothes.

718
00:36:28,039 --> 00:36:28,360
Come on.

719
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:28,639
Bro,

720
00:36:28,639 --> 00:36:30,119
Everyone knows these are my personal clothes.

721
00:36:30,119 --> 00:36:31,239
And you still want to open them?

722
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,119
He already said he's not here to investigate.

723
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:33,800
Aren't you embarrassed?

724
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:34,880
I'm the one who's embarrassed.

725
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,039
We're family.

726
00:36:36,039 --> 00:36:36,760
He's not embarrassed.

727
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:37,719
Why should I be embarrassed?

728
00:36:37,719 --> 00:36:38,039
No, no, no.

729
00:36:38,039 --> 00:36:38,440
Come on, come on.

730
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,039
Brother, you—

731
00:36:39,039 --> 00:36:39,840
You have to look.

732
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:41,679
Look at you—

733
00:36:42,239 --> 00:36:43,679
You really make me feel ashamed.

734
00:36:43,719 --> 00:36:45,679
Brother, why go this far?

735
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:47,320
Let me tell you, Cui Mo,

736
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,159
Today you have to get to the bottom of this for me.

737
00:36:49,159 --> 00:36:50,679
Otherwise, just shoot me.

738
00:36:50,679 --> 00:36:52,039
So you won't keep overthinking all the time.

739
00:36:52,039 --> 00:36:52,760
Always being suspicious.

740
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:53,000
Come on.

741
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:53,880
Alright, alright, brother.

742
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:54,559
Brother.

743
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:55,119
No, no, no.

744
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:55,480
Look.

745
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,199
You have to look.

746
00:36:56,199 --> 00:36:56,800
That's enough, brother.

747
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:57,360
This little bit doesn't matter.

748
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:57,679
Alright.

749
00:36:57,679 --> 00:36:58,320
Alright, brother.

750
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,039
That's enough.

751
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:00,480
Sister-in-law.

752
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:01,800
You've been wronged.

753
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,239
I was wrong.

754
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:07,199
I was wrong, okay?

755
00:37:13,639 --> 00:37:14,679
We brothers—

756
00:37:14,679 --> 00:37:16,039
We've had so many years of friendship.

757
00:37:17,559 --> 00:37:18,960
If I don't trust anyone,

758
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:20,360
how could I not trust you?

759
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:22,599
Me,

760
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,280
I really came here today just to see sister-in-law.

761
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:31,000
So I misunderstood Brother Cui.

762
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:31,880
That's right.

763
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:34,559
Come in.

764
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:43,679
Boss

765
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,360
I could only get these gifts.

766
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:47,079
There was really nothing else to buy downstairs.

767
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,000
They really are checking up on me.

768
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:54,840
Brother

769
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:56,840
Sorry about this.

770
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:57,960
Sister-in-law

771
00:37:58,920 --> 00:37:59,639
Sorry for the offense.

772
00:38:02,559 --> 00:38:03,639
I'll wait for you downstairs.

773
00:38:21,719 --> 00:38:22,519
Come out.

774
00:38:28,199 --> 00:38:29,039
That was close.

775
00:38:29,679 --> 00:38:30,960
Will they come up again?

776
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:31,960
They probably won't.

777
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,880
But don't leave now.

778
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,119
Wait until it gets dark.

779
00:38:52,159 --> 00:38:52,880
Chief Cui

780
00:38:53,159 --> 00:38:54,840
Should the guys withdraw?

781
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,079
Leave a lookout.

782
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:57,199
Keep an eye on this place for me.

783
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,920
I want to make sure no one else gets close.

784
00:39:00,199 --> 00:39:00,840
Yes.

785
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,800
Buy some braised snacks and other treats.

786
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,679
Send them up to Miss Xie.

787
00:39:07,159 --> 00:39:07,960
Chief Cui

788
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,039
With her illness,

789
00:39:09,039 --> 00:39:10,360
can she eat these things?

790
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,239
If she's really sick,

791
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,159
of course she wouldn't eat them.

792
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,159
I understand.

793
00:39:17,159 --> 00:39:18,159
I'll take care of it right away.

794
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,119
Brother

795
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:23,960
How are things?

796
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:25,360
Have you settled your wife?

797
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,320
If you don't give me an explanation,

798
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,559
I can't let this go.

799
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,280
As your older brother,

800
00:39:30,599 --> 00:39:31,719
I apologize to you.

801
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:35,360
The Japanese have been pressing us too hard.

802
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,039
I've been so busy these days, I'm completely overwhelmed.

803
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,519
People below have been spreading rumors.

804
00:39:39,719 --> 00:39:41,400
That's why I suspected your wife.

805
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:42,920
Spreading rumors?

806
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:46,400
We've been through life and death together for so many years.

807
00:39:47,039 --> 00:39:48,519
And you still don't trust me?

808
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,519
You'd sell me out over a few rumors?

809
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:52,760
I trust you one hundred percent.

810
00:39:53,239 --> 00:39:54,400
But the people around you,

811
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,239
I have to be cautious about them.

812
00:39:59,559 --> 00:40:00,679
From what I'm hearing,

813
00:40:01,079 --> 00:40:02,679
you're not suspecting me,

814
00:40:02,679 --> 00:40:04,119
but rather, you're worried about me.

815
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:05,480
What do you think?

816
00:40:06,559 --> 00:40:08,079
I really am worried about you.

817
00:40:09,719 --> 00:40:10,679
I think

818
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,519
your concern

819
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:15,000
is making it a bit hard for me to breathe.

820
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:15,880
Brother, brother, brother,

821
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:16,679
alright, alright, alright.

822
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:18,559
Just this once.

823
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,039
There won't be a next time.

824
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:20,880
Okay?

825
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:24,599
Alright.

826
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,320
I understand you.

827
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:27,719
Given the current situation,

828
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:28,960
there's nothing you can do.

829
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,360
As long as the anti-Japanese elements aren't eliminated,

830
00:40:32,039 --> 00:40:34,159
we'll keep suspecting each other.

831
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,039
Before the Japanese even make a move,

832
00:40:36,159 --> 00:40:37,239
these miserable lives of ours

833
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,719
will end up being ruined by our own people sooner or later.

834
00:40:40,719 --> 00:40:41,920
To be honest,

835
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:43,719
there's no problem with your wife.

836
00:40:44,719 --> 00:40:46,079
I'm even happier than you are.

837
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:47,679
How about this:

838
00:40:47,719 --> 00:40:49,079
After the peace conference is over,

839
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:50,719
I'll personally ask the director for your leave.

840
00:40:51,639 --> 00:40:53,159
You're about to get married soon.

841
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,880
You can't always be on the front lines.

842
00:40:57,599 --> 00:40:59,079
Now that's something reasonable.

843
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,079
That's true.

844
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:01,320
The brothers

845
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:03,000
are already so tense they're about to lose it.

846
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,719
We really do need a couple of days off.

847
00:41:04,719 --> 00:41:05,679
I'll do as you say.

848
00:41:05,679 --> 00:41:06,320
Let's go.

849
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:38,800
How is it?

850
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,920
What did Director Lu do today?

851
00:41:41,239 --> 00:41:42,119
He was in the office the whole time.

852
00:41:42,159 --> 00:41:43,320
He only went out once in the middle.

853
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:44,280
Where did he go?

854
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:45,119
To Geluoxi Road.

855
00:41:45,639 --> 00:41:47,119
We lost track of him once.

856
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:48,719
But it was only for two or three minutes.

857
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:49,920
When we caught up again,

858
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:50,800
he had already returned to headquarters.

859
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:53,320
What about now?

860
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:54,280
He's in the office.

861
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,280
Boss, do you want me to keep watching him?

862
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:58,559
No need.

863
00:42:00,199 --> 00:42:01,199
These are unusual times.

864
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:03,960
We can't be blamed for being a bit cautious.

865
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:04,599
Right.

866
00:42:04,599 --> 00:42:05,800
Go back and rest for now.

867
00:42:06,039 --> 00:42:06,719
Okay, boss.

868
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:07,840
I'll come pick you up tomorrow then.

869
00:42:11,239 --> 00:42:12,280
Geluoxi Road.

870
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,760
Scorpio's territory.
