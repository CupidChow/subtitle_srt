1
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,319
Mr. Liang

2
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,599
You are both wise and courageous

3
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,400
A truly rare talent

4
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,599
And time and again, through your actions

5
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:53,560
You have proven your loyalty to the new government

6
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,159
And to the Empire of Japan

7
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,079
The position of Deputy Director of the Special Investigation Department

8
00:01:57,079 --> 00:01:58,400
Could belong to no one but you

9
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:00,879
As you Chinese would say

10
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,400
After Mr. Liang

11
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,920
The responsibility is heavy and the road is long

12
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:06,519
It is my honor

13
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,000
Regarding the recent Wang Qiaosu case

14
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:10,879
I have troubled you, Chief

15
00:02:11,359 --> 00:02:12,079
As the

16
00:02:12,079 --> 00:02:13,919
Director of the No. 76 Operations Division

17
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:15,120
I did not fulfill my duty

18
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,319
I ask for your punishment, Chief

19
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:21,879
This was due to Takagi's recklessness

20
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:22,879
It has nothing to do with you

21
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,360
Mr. Liang, please have a seat

22
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:26,560
Thank you, Chief

23
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:30,840
What’s done is done

24
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,240
We need to find out

25
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,680
What the Chongqing agents’ next objective is

26
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:37,080
That is what we should focus on now

27
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:38,560
I invited you here this time

28
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,159
Because I also want to hear

29
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:39,960
Your thoughts on

30
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,840
The current state of the struggle

31
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,479
So that in the future

32
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:44,360
We can work together more effectively

33
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:47,639
I, Liang Shuo, will speak without reservation

34
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:52,520
The code name for the Chongqing agents’ secret plan

35
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,080
Is "Snow Blindness"

36
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:56,439
In your opinion, Mr. Liang

37
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,439
Do these two words have any special meaning?

38
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,759
As far as I know,

39
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,080
snow blindness is a common eye condition

40
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,560
in the northern snowfields.

41
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,840
As for whether it has any special significance,

42
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,039
I would need to ask the chief for guidance.

43
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,479
My hometown is in Nagano, Japan.

44
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,840
Skiing is a popular pastime

45
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,520
among young people where I'm from.

46
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,039
I was no exception.

47
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:26,039
When I was young,

48
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:26,479
I didn't know

49
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:28,599
that you shouldn't stay in the snow for too long.

50
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,400
Ignoring my friends' warnings,

51
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:31,800
I went alone

52
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:33,280
to the top of the mountain,

53
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,520
planning to break the village's skiing record.

54
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,000
But what I didn't expect

55
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,360
was that just as I was feeling confident,

56
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,960
ready to ski straight down

57
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,199
from the summit,

58
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,360
an accident happened.

59
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,120
Snow blindness.

60
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:51,439
That's right.

61
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,840
I didn't realize

62
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:56,759
that staying in the snow for too long

63
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,199
had put a lot of strain

64
00:03:58,199 --> 00:03:59,879
on my eyes.

65
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,240
In just an instant,

66
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,280
everything in front of me turned white.

67
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,479
I couldn't see anything.

68
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:07,159
And in that same instant,

69
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,039
I

70
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:09,759
fell from the top of the mountain.

71
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:11,599
I broke thirteen bones all over my body.

72
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:13,879
If my friends hadn't found me,

73
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,319
then right now,

74
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:18,240
I probably wouldn't be standing here.

75
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,879
I understand what you mean, Chief.

76
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:27,800
Snow blindness isn't a serious illness.

77
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:29,399
It's also easy to cure.

78
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:32,439
But if it happens at the wrong time,

79
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:34,439
it can be extremely deadly.

80
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,560
Mr. Liang, you really grasp things instantly.

81
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,000
I was thinking the same thing.

82
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:40,639
The anti-Japanese elements

83
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,519
are looking for the right opportunity.

84
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Now it seems

85
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,120
that opportunity is likely the Peace Conference.

86
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,519
That's right.

87
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:51,800
Since the anti-Japanese elements plan to act at the Peace Conference,

88
00:04:51,879 --> 00:04:53,160
instead of passively defending,

89
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:55,319
we should take the initiative.

90
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,079
Disrupt their plans.

91
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,079
I wonder, Chief,

92
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:00,920
what your plan is.

93
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:05,879
I've already submitted a request to the Army Department

94
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:07,279
and the Special Affairs Committee

95
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:08,319
for approval.

96
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,199
To move the date of the Peace Conference

97
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:11,160
up by two days,

98
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,399
and relocate it from the original northern Shanghai district.

99
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,279
This way, we can completely disrupt

100
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:18,120
the anti-Japanese elements' plans.

101
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,040
Mr. Liang,

102
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:20,920
what do you think?

103
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:29,000
I completely agree.

104
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:31,480
The more tense the situation,

105
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:33,319
the more likely the anti-Japanese elements

106
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:34,959
are to make mistakes.

107
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,879
As soon as their arrangements are disrupted,

108
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:39,199
that's the best time for us to close the net.

109
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,759
But I wonder, Chief,

110
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,160
what your deployment will be.

111
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,639
Wait until the time is right.

112
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,399
Mr. Liang will naturally find out.

113
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:55,800
We suspect

114
00:05:55,879 --> 00:05:58,759
that the intelligence headquarters has already been infiltrated by anti-Japanese elements.

115
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:00,120
Therefore, together with

116
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,160
the Special Affairs Committee,

117
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,680
the purpose of establishing the Special Investigation Division is precisely this.

118
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:04,959
This way,

119
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:06,959
Mr. Liang's men will become

120
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:09,160
a surprise force during the Peace Conference.

121
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,720
What we want

122
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,120
is not just

123
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,800
the safety of the new government officials,

124
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:15,399
but also

125
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,600
the heads of the anti-Japanese elements.

126
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:25,199
I understand.

127
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:31,800
The plan has changed.

128
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,639
We must get the message out as soon as possible.

129
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,160
Chief,

130
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,439
what is your first impression of Mr. Liang?

131
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:49,800
He is a sharp hunter.

132
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:53,720
But he gives me an indescribable feeling.

133
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:56,600
Chief, do you suspect him?

134
00:06:57,439 --> 00:06:59,160
As long as they're Chinese,

135
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,639
I won't trust any of them.

136
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,120
At the moment,

137
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,800
there really isn't anyone else besides him.

138
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:06,879
If he doesn't waste time and works efficiently,

139
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,720
and if we train him to get up to speed quickly,

140
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,399
he'll be a useful weapon.

141
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,120
Dying is easy.

142
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,279
Dying with value is what's hard.

143
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,879
Say something.

144
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,000
Go on, say something.

145
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,160
The Snow Blind mission is on the verge of collapse.

146
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,680
I need you to do whatever it takes,

147
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,360
to infiltrate the enemy.

148
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:02,399
From now on, the codename Scholar

149
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,759
will be a thing of the past.

150
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,800
If Shadow dies,

151
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,199
you will become Shadow.

152
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,240
If Shadow returns alive,

153
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:10,519
help Shadow.

154
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,879
Cover him.

155
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:13,319
That is your only mission.

156
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:16,600
You must be prepared to sacrifice yourself for him at any time.

157
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,240
Who are you?

158
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:42,639
Why are you giving me information about him?

159
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,759
Have the people we called from out of town arrived?

160
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,679
They've arrived.

161
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,639
This time,

162
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,039
there can be no more mistakes.

163
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,120
Yes.

164
00:08:56,879 --> 00:08:57,679
Salute.

165
00:08:58,559 --> 00:08:59,360
At ease.

166
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:01,320
Boss, are we going back to headquarters or...

167
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,480
I have something important to take care of.

168
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,279
Take me to Xiyuan Road.

169
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:04,360
Then you can leave.

170
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:04,960
Okay.

171
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,679
Ow, it hurts!

172
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:36,799
Why is it you?

173
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,279
It hurts.

174
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,039
What are you doing?

175
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:50,840
Let's go.

176
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,240
I've been looking for you.

177
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:06,240
Let go, it hurts.

178
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,600
Someone is chasing me.

179
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,039
Who is it?

180
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:10,279
It seems like when I just got back to Shanghai before.

181
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:11,480
The people who tried to kill me.

182
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,200
Let's go.

183
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:18,759
It looks like they're catching up.

184
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:20,080
I'll try to lure them away.

185
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:21,960
Hurry, after them!

186
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,799
Sit here, don't move.

187
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:31,039
Get out of the way!

188
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:31,679
That's him!

189
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:32,919
Chase him!

190
00:10:32,919 --> 00:10:33,480
Stop!

191
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,080
Catch him!

192
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:35,960
Move aside!

193
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,279
He's over there, go after him!

194
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:39,720
Stop! Stop!

195
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,279
Chase him!

196
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:42,320
Stop!

197
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,320
Stop!

198
00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:54,600
What are you doing here?

199
00:10:56,039 --> 00:10:57,519
They must be from a gang.

200
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,960
How did Liang Shuo get into trouble with them?

201
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,159
He mentioned it to me before.

202
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,799
He said a group of gang members have been after him.

203
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,600
Because of his identity as Number 76,

204
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,120
it's not necessarily true

205
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,799
that everyone chasing him is a bad person.

206
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,720
No wonder he didn't fight back.

207
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:13,679
I'll call the police first.

208
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:15,000
Then I'll inform Number 76.

209
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,120
You stay here.

210
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:16,879
No.

211
00:11:17,559 --> 00:11:18,759
I can help.

212
00:11:27,879 --> 00:11:28,799
Six bullets.

213
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:30,600
If your life is in danger, shoot without hesitation.

214
00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:31,840
This gun isn't very powerful.

215
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,279
As long as you don't aim for vital spots,

216
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:34,399
it won't be fatal.

217
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:35,080
Alright.

218
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,200
Let's split up.

219
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,639
Be careful.

220
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:54,960
Everyone, don't panic.

221
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:55,799
Don't be afraid.

222
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:57,240
Please, sit down quickly.

223
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,279
Troupe leader, keep singing.

224
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,360
Is this the police station?

225
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,600
This is Pingchuan Academy.

226
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,440
I want to report a crime.

227
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,200
Someone committed an assault.

228
00:12:16,279 --> 00:12:17,600
I suspect it's an anti-Japanese activist.

229
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,080
Who are you people?

230
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,879
Why are you targeting me?

231
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,360
Traitor!

232
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,279
You're the one who got Master Jiu killed.

233
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:43,639
Even if I die, I, Gu Zhentian, won't let you go.

234
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,120
Go!

235
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,000
Let him go.

236
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:48,960
I told you to let him go.

237
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:52,759
Stop.

238
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,360
I'll say it again.

239
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:55,519
Let go.

240
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,399
Liang Shuo.

241
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,440
Liang Shuo.

242
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,679
Take me to Fei Man.

243
00:14:08,919 --> 00:14:09,600
Otherwise,

244
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,480
it'll be too late.

245
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,320
Go.

246
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:12,759
Hurry.

247
00:14:12,759 --> 00:14:13,519
Slow down.

248
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,240
Troupe leader, keep singing.

249
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,720
Everyone, please sit.

250
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:24,159
Keep listening to the music, keep listening.

251
00:14:24,159 --> 00:14:24,759
Who called the authorities?

252
00:14:24,759 --> 00:14:25,759
Step back, step back.

253
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,000
Officer.

254
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,559
Just now, a group of people were chasing someone with axes.

255
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:29,600
They went that way.

256
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:30,440
I saw it clearly.

257
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,720
A group of people with axes.

258
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:32,799
Chasing.

259
00:14:32,919 --> 00:14:33,519
Yes.

260
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:37,399
It's all right now, it's all right.

261
00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:38,879
Everyone, sit down and listen to the music.

262
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,039
Everyone, sit, sit.

263
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:43,559
Keep watching the show.

264
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,240
Liang Shuo.

265
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:48,720
Liang Shuo.

266
00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:52,240
Liang Shuo.

267
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:55,159
Liang Shuo.

268
00:14:57,559 --> 00:14:58,120
The police are here.

269
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:58,960
They should be able to hold them off.

270
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:00,799
He's badly hurt.

271
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,360
Help me support him.

272
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,120
Hang in there.

273
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:21,799
Tell Old Tan

274
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,559
The time has changed

275
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:26,080
It's two days earlier

276
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:29,759
Thirty-one

277
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:31,600
Plan Thirty-One

278
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,720
There's no time left

279
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:36,879
What are you talking about?

280
00:15:36,879 --> 00:15:37,480
Liang Shuo

281
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:38,480
Help him into the car

282
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:39,919
Come on

283
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:40,840
Come on

284
00:15:42,679 --> 00:15:43,399
Slow down

285
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:44,799
Hurry up

286
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,519
Be careful

287
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,480
He has a very high fever

288
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,600
We need to go to the hospital right away

289
00:15:48,799 --> 00:15:49,919
Where is the nearest hospital?

290
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,399
The Japanese Army hospital

291
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:53,759
Don't go to the hospital

292
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:02,519
He's so badly injured

293
00:16:02,919 --> 00:16:03,919
We can't worry about that now

294
00:16:04,039 --> 00:16:05,000
We have to go to the hospital

295
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:05,679
Hurry

296
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:06,600
They're up ahead

297
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:07,759
You go first

298
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:08,480
Leave the rest to me

299
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,399
Be careful

300
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:12,960
Liang Shuo

301
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:14,960
Lie still

302
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:40,039
You got beaten up this badly

303
00:16:40,679 --> 00:16:41,840
And you're still being stubborn

304
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:43,799
I...

305
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:48,559
Director Cui

306
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:52,720
The search operation is already in full swing

307
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,840
Our whole department is here

308
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,159
Please give us your instructions, Director Cui

309
00:16:56,159 --> 00:16:57,320
Thank you for your hard work, Director Liu

310
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,879
It's my duty

311
00:17:04,519 --> 00:17:05,360
Brother

312
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,559
Where are you from?

313
00:17:07,399 --> 00:17:08,720
Are you from an association or a gang?

314
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:10,680
Chongqing

315
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,160
You're not from Yan'an, are you?

316
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:17,759
Director

317
00:17:18,039 --> 00:17:19,640
This is the leader of Da Feng Hall

318
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:20,920
Gu Zhentian

319
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:22,359
Da Feng Hall

320
00:17:24,039 --> 00:17:24,839
Master Gu

321
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,920
I like men with your kind of spirit

322
00:17:28,519 --> 00:17:29,440
Take him back

323
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:30,960
Treat him well

324
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:31,640
Yes

325
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:33,000
Take him away

326
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,440
Bring him back

327
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,279
Treat him well

328
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,440
Chief Liu

329
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,880
Anyone we catch from now on

330
00:17:44,359 --> 00:17:45,880
Send them to me as well

331
00:17:46,119 --> 00:17:46,960
Don't worry, Director

332
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:48,440
Director

333
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:49,960
Director Cui

334
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:51,559
What's wrong?

335
00:17:51,559 --> 00:17:52,279
Something happened

336
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,000
It's Liang Shuo

337
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,039
He might be in trouble

338
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,319
He just went nearby to take care of something

339
00:17:55,319 --> 00:17:56,440
Then he told me to go back first

340
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:56,880
But then...

341
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:59,240
I suspect this isn't just a simple disturbance

342
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:00,640
Someone wants to assassinate Director Liang

343
00:18:01,759 --> 00:18:03,079
They're asking for death

344
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,119
Don't move.

345
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:38,680
He's the Director of Operations at the Special Agent Headquarters.

346
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:39,799
This is his ID.

347
00:18:39,799 --> 00:18:40,680
His name is Liang Shuo.

348
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,640
You have to save him.

349
00:18:42,519 --> 00:18:44,680
He's the Director of Operations at the Special Agent Headquarters.

350
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,759
His name is Liang Shuo.

351
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:47,079
You have to save him.

352
00:18:47,079 --> 00:18:48,400
This is his ID.

353
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,759
Hurry up.

354
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,200
You're awake.

355
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:20,839
You...

356
00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:22,519
How do you feel?

357
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:27,559
Come on, take it slow.

358
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,599
Hey, look at me.

359
00:19:40,519 --> 00:19:41,480
Who am I?

360
00:19:43,839 --> 00:19:44,680
Do you still remember?

361
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,640
Xie Nianci

362
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:54,279
You scared me to death.

363
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,720
I thought you had forgotten everything again.

364
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:01,799
Thank you.

365
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:05,000
If you hadn't shot to save me,

366
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,200
If you really want to thank me,

367
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,160
can you tell me the truth?

368
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:13,119
You and Jiang Feiman—

369
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:15,359
what exactly is your relationship?

370
00:20:17,079 --> 00:20:18,279
What are you trying to say?

371
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,559
Do you still remember

372
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:22,599
that before you fell unconscious, you kept asking me

373
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,599
to take you to find Jiang Feiman?

374
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,039
I asked Jiang Feiman.

375
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:29,240
I know you two aren't lovers.

376
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,039
So what is your relationship, really?

377
00:20:33,079 --> 00:20:33,960
While you were unconscious,

378
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,000
if it weren't for her,

379
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,240
we wouldn't have made it here.

380
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:38,119
To put it simply,

381
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,200
as for her,

382
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:40,279
she's very meticulous,

383
00:20:40,359 --> 00:20:41,240
and she knows how to use a gun.

384
00:20:41,559 --> 00:20:42,640
She's not an ordinary person.

385
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,319
Then who exactly is she?

386
00:20:44,599 --> 00:20:46,000
And what's her relationship with you?

387
00:20:51,279 --> 00:20:52,359
You're overthinking it.

388
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,480
What do you think she is?

389
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:56,680
I don't know.

390
00:20:57,279 --> 00:20:58,480
But I want to hear it from you.

391
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,400
Who is she?

392
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,200
You're not answering me.

393
00:21:02,839 --> 00:21:03,640
Why?

394
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
You don't trust me.

395
00:21:05,079 --> 00:21:06,440
Are you afraid I'll tell Old Xie?

396
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,119
Nian Ci

397
00:21:16,759 --> 00:21:18,200
You’ve saved me twice.

398
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,359
I trust you.

399
00:21:21,279 --> 00:21:22,119
But

400
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:24,079
at a time like this,

401
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,559
I won’t risk anyone’s life as a joke.

402
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,000
Do you understand?

403
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:30,680
I understand.

404
00:21:31,319 --> 00:21:32,319
I just feel

405
00:21:32,519 --> 00:21:34,119
there’s nothing you need to hide from me.

406
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,119
Even if she’s with the underground,

407
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,960
I wouldn’t tell anyone.

408
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,440
Let me be honest with you.

409
00:21:42,359 --> 00:21:43,440
As for Chongqing,

410
00:21:43,799 --> 00:21:45,119
I lost faith in it a long time ago.

411
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,519
That includes Lao Xie.

412
00:21:48,119 --> 00:21:48,920
Why?

413
00:21:49,759 --> 00:21:50,839
I think he’s changed.

414
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,200
He’ll turn his back on anyone to complete his mission.

415
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:54,759
The matter at Pingjia Lane,

416
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,079
you’ve already taken care of it.

417
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,200
He also promised me

418
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,519
he’d get you out of Shanghai.

419
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,119
But he went back on his word.

420
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,759
And he’s full of lies.

421
00:22:03,599 --> 00:22:04,839
I see that clearly now.

422
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,640
He never really wanted you to leave.

423
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:08,039
As expected.

424
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,839
And as of today,

425
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,880
I don’t plan to leave Shanghai either.

426
00:22:13,319 --> 00:22:14,119
Why?

427
00:22:15,079 --> 00:22:16,839
Even if I die here,

428
00:22:16,839 --> 00:22:17,799
you still won’t leave?

429
00:22:20,359 --> 00:22:21,759
I thought that if I forgot everything

430
00:22:21,759 --> 00:22:23,319
I could start over

431
00:22:23,799 --> 00:22:25,359
and live as an ordinary person

432
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:26,440
leave Shanghai

433
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,920
and do anything I wanted

434
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,480
But I don't think that way anymore

435
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,759
Do you know how many of our compatriots I saw

436
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:36,960
in No. 76

437
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,240
die under Japanese guns?

438
00:22:40,519 --> 00:22:42,200
How many heroes I saw

439
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,680
sacrifice their lives?

440
00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:46,319
In times of national crisis

441
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,559
where can we find refuge?

442
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,839
Rather than just surviving out there

443
00:22:52,119 --> 00:22:55,279
I'd rather live a passionate life here

444
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:58,480
I will use my own way

445
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,240
to fight them to the end

446
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:04,519
But

447
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,279
I still worry about you.

448
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,200
You know that.

449
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,319
Old Xie is a very suspicious person.

450
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,720
If he ever starts suspecting you,

451
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,400
you'll be in trouble.

452
00:23:17,799 --> 00:23:19,640
The patient in bed fifteen is in critical condition.

453
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,799
Come quickly.

454
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,279
Where is this place?

455
00:23:23,799 --> 00:23:24,960
Why are there Japanese people here?

456
00:23:25,119 --> 00:23:26,200
It's a Japanese Army hospital.

457
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,480
Your injuries were too severe.

458
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,519
I really had no other choice.

459
00:23:28,519 --> 00:23:29,799
That's why I brought you here.

460
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,079
I used your pass.

461
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:34,319
That's bad.

462
00:23:34,839 --> 00:23:35,839
There could be trouble.

463
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:36,960
What do you mean?

464
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:39,200
You risked your life to get me to the hospital.

465
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,839
That proves our relationship is not ordinary.

466
00:23:42,119 --> 00:23:44,079
With Hirata Xizi's attention to detail,

467
00:23:44,279 --> 00:23:46,119
she will definitely notice this clue.

468
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,039
You have to leave immediately.

469
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,599
It was my oversight.

470
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:50,960
I'll leave right now.

471
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,279
Then take care of yourself.

472
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,519
Remember,

473
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:56,359
if anyone asks,

474
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:57,920
just say we are

475
00:23:58,359 --> 00:23:59,119
dating.

476
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:01,799
Okay.

477
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,440
Director Hirata

478
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,400
Do you know how Liang Shuo is doing now?

479
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,000
I'm very worried too.

480
00:24:22,119 --> 00:24:22,640
However,

481
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,559
the Army Hospital has the best doctors in Shanghai.

482
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:28,119
About this incident,

483
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,960
how exactly did it happen?

484
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:30,839
Liang Shuo

485
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,200
wasn't he supposed to return to headquarters after the ceremony?

486
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,359
Wasn't he supposed to go back to headquarters?

487
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:34,400
I'm not sure either.

488
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:35,359
The driver said

489
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:36,799
he went there to take care of something.

490
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,480
He was inexplicably targeted.

491
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:40,880
These anti-Japanese activists nowadays

492
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,039
are really audacious.

493
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,720
They even dare to kill people in broad daylight.

494
00:24:44,119 --> 00:24:45,720
Have you found any leads?

495
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,200
It's said

496
00:24:47,359 --> 00:24:48,480
that it was anti-Japanese activists

497
00:24:48,519 --> 00:24:49,759
seeking revenge for Yan Jiu.

498
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,000
We must investigate this thoroughly.

499
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:55,519
Liang Shuo is currently handling affairs for the Special Investigation Division.

500
00:24:55,599 --> 00:24:57,160
Nothing can be allowed to go wrong.

501
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,119
I will also suggest to Director Li

502
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,039
that we protect Liang Shuo at all costs.

503
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:03,759
Director Hirata

504
00:25:04,119 --> 00:25:05,279
If Director Liang knew

505
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:06,680
that you were concerned about his safety,

506
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:07,960
he would be extremely grateful.

507
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:08,640
Please.

508
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:14,880
How is Director Liang?

509
00:25:16,759 --> 00:25:19,039
It's just a superficial wound.

510
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:20,000
Nothing serious.

511
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:21,920
We've assigned the most professional medical team to care for him.

512
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,880
He's also in a special ward with the best facilities.

513
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,400
Please rest assured.

514
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:29,599
By the way,

515
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,400
Who brought him here?

516
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:32,599
Please wait a moment.

517
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,079
It was a young woman.

518
00:25:38,279 --> 00:25:39,920
She didn't sign her full name.

519
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,519
She only wrote "Director Liang's friend."

520
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:47,720
Friend?

521
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,039
Yes.

522
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,000
Director Cui.

523
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:53,079
Does Liang Shuo usually have any

524
00:25:53,079 --> 00:25:54,559
close female friends?

525
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,440
That's his personal business.

526
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,640
I usually don't ask about it.

527
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,839
Is his friend still here?

528
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:03,359
Yes, she's still here.

529
00:26:20,759 --> 00:26:21,279
Wait.

530
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,279
Miss,

531
00:26:29,319 --> 00:26:30,920
haven't we met somewhere before?

532
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,519
It's you.

533
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:38,720
And you are?

534
00:26:56,839 --> 00:26:57,640
Liang Shuo.

535
00:27:02,519 --> 00:27:03,319
Liang Shuo.

536
00:27:08,519 --> 00:27:09,920
Why are you back?

537
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:13,880
Director Hirata.

538
00:27:14,279 --> 00:27:14,960
Brother Cui.

539
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:16,079
Why are you two here?

540
00:27:16,079 --> 00:27:16,599
Mr. Liang.

541
00:27:16,599 --> 00:27:18,200
No need to be so formal. Get some rest.

542
00:27:19,519 --> 00:27:20,440
Excuse me.

543
00:27:21,079 --> 00:27:22,279
How did things end up like this?

544
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,759
Director Hirata and I heard something happened to you.

545
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,119
We were both very worried about you.

546
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:27,160
Originally,

547
00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:28,839
we didn't even know which room you were in.

548
00:27:29,079 --> 00:27:29,880
As luck would have it,

549
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:31,640
at the entrance,

550
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,119
we ran into Miss Xie.

551
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:33,960
Brother.

552
00:27:34,599 --> 00:27:35,559
You two—

553
00:27:36,039 --> 00:27:37,039
what's going on between you?

554
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,519
Sorry to have made you laugh at me.

555
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,240
Liang.

556
00:27:57,359 --> 00:27:58,359
You're this badly injured,

557
00:27:58,559 --> 00:27:59,599
yet you can still joke around.

558
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,039
If it were someone else,

559
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:02,720
they'd be half dead by now.

560
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:05,039
Chief Hirata should know

561
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,279
I've always been lucky.

562
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,160
Don't say things like that.

563
00:28:09,599 --> 00:28:10,359
It's bad luck.

564
00:28:12,839 --> 00:28:14,680
I heard Miss Xie brought you here.

565
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,200
A beauty saving a hero,

566
00:28:16,359 --> 00:28:17,240
that's pretty romantic.

567
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:20,880
About you two,

568
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,279
when did it start?

569
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,440
You didn't even tell me.

570
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,799
That's too distant of you.

571
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,279
Hiding your beauty away.

572
00:28:27,599 --> 00:28:30,319
Liang, you really know how to keep a secret.

573
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,400
In our line of work as agents,

574
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:35,680
we're always living on the edge.

575
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,400
Once we step out of headquarters,

576
00:28:38,759 --> 00:28:41,160
there are too many people who want us dead.

577
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,319
No matter how well we keep things secret, it's useless.

578
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:46,160
Take this time, for example.

579
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,920
Everything was fine,

580
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,559
so how did we get exposed?

581
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,960
I feel like these assassins have been planning this for a long time.

582
00:28:55,119 --> 00:28:56,960
Brother Cui, have you investigated these people?

583
00:28:57,759 --> 00:28:58,799
Preliminary investigation shows

584
00:28:59,519 --> 00:29:01,079
they are remnants of Yan Jiu's group.

585
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,920
The rest is still under investigation.

586
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:03,960
Don't worry.

587
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:06,400
I will get to the bottom of this.

588
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:08,160
If they dare to touch you,

589
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,759
I'll take their lives.

590
00:29:11,799 --> 00:29:13,480
I should have thought of this earlier.

591
00:29:14,039 --> 00:29:15,680
Ever since the news that I killed Yan Jiu

592
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,039
came back from Manchuria,

593
00:29:17,799 --> 00:29:18,960
the people looking to cause me trouble

594
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,559
have only increased day by day.

595
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,480
Since you know this,

596
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,079
why were you so careless?

597
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:26,599
Why didn't you bring more men with you?

598
00:29:27,079 --> 00:29:27,759
And also,

599
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,559
why did you go alone

600
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,319
to such a remote place?

601
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:37,920
Chief Hirata,

602
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,920
I wonder if it's convenient

603
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,920
for me to have a private word with Brother Liang.

604
00:29:43,079 --> 00:29:44,160
Of course, that's fine.

605
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,200
Actually,

606
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,000
I also want to spend some time with Miss Xie.

607
00:29:47,359 --> 00:29:48,519
Get to know her better.

608
00:29:53,319 --> 00:29:56,240
Then I'll go have a chat with this young lady.

609
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,640
This Miss Xie,

610
00:30:16,279 --> 00:30:17,160
I've seen her before.

611
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:20,640
Brother,

612
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,000
now that there are no outsiders,

613
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,680
you owe me an explanation.

614
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:37,880
No need to be nervous.

615
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:38,839
Miss Xie,

616
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:41,400
I'm just going to ask a few questions.

617
00:30:41,519 --> 00:30:42,319
That's all.

618
00:30:44,119 --> 00:30:44,920
Why?

619
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,240
It's just

620
00:30:48,519 --> 00:30:49,759
a routine procedure.

621
00:30:51,079 --> 00:30:54,079
You know what Mr. Liang does for a living.

622
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,640
Cooperating with our work

623
00:30:55,839 --> 00:30:56,880
for you

624
00:30:57,079 --> 00:30:58,319
won't do any harm.

625
00:30:58,880 --> 00:30:59,519
Please have a seat.

626
00:31:12,039 --> 00:31:13,519
What do you want me to say?

627
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,319
Men and women have desires and emotions.

628
00:31:16,519 --> 00:31:18,319
That's only human nature, isn't it?

629
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,440
When Brother Cui and his wife first got together,

630
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,559
did they have to report it to their colleagues too?

631
00:31:24,519 --> 00:31:25,519
You know,

632
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,160
times have changed.

633
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,319
The Japanese are watching too closely now.

634
00:31:31,839 --> 00:31:34,720
Not to mention that Miss Xie and I haven't even established a relationship yet.

635
00:31:35,079 --> 00:31:36,680
Even if we had,

636
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,880
we would still have to report it to the General Affairs Office.

637
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,079
I'm just looking out for you.

638
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,759
I'm just puzzled.

639
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,680
Your sister-in-law introduced you to so many

640
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:46,519
well-bred ladies and socialites back then.

641
00:31:46,519 --> 00:31:47,839
You didn't like any of them.

642
00:31:49,319 --> 00:31:52,119
Matters of the heart should happen naturally.

643
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,920
You can't force them.

644
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,680
As for Miss Xie,

645
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,440
what's her story?

646
00:31:58,799 --> 00:31:59,920
I'm really curious.

647
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,480
What kind of girl

648
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,920
could possibly catch your eye?

649
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,920
Well-bred ladies are certainly nice,

650
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,720
but when two people are together,

651
00:32:11,079 --> 00:32:12,119
what matters most is understanding each other.

652
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,640
The affection you and your wife share

653
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,680
is truly enviable.

654
00:32:17,079 --> 00:32:18,039
In my opinion,

655
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,720
two people must have similar interests and hobbies

656
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,119
to be together.

657
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,079
How did you two meet?

658
00:32:25,599 --> 00:32:26,599
Miss Xie,

659
00:32:26,839 --> 00:32:29,039
how did you meet Liang Shuo?

660
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,480
It's a long story.

661
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,799
Why don't we wait until Miss Xie comes back

662
00:32:35,799 --> 00:32:37,079
and then talk about it?

663
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:38,519
Brother,

664
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,519
to be honest,

665
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,240
it's not that I don't trust you.

666
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:44,680
Would I ever doubt you?

667
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,960
It's just that your current position

668
00:32:48,279 --> 00:32:49,119
is too sensitive.

669
00:32:49,599 --> 00:32:51,440
We always have to be careful of those

670
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,440
who deliberately try to get close to you.

671
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,559
I knew it.

672
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:00,839
Today, when Brother Cui asked questions,

673
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:03,720
it felt very official.

674
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:04,519
Really?

675
00:33:07,599 --> 00:33:08,400
Alright.

676
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:10,720
Since this is official business,

677
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,880
I'll cooperate fully.

678
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:16,039
Brother Cui asked

679
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,519
how I met Miss Xie.

680
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,319
Near the train station.

681
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,039
At that time,

682
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:24,480
I was being questioned by a group of patrolmen.

683
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,240
At the train station,

684
00:33:27,119 --> 00:33:29,720
Miss Xie ran into a bit of trouble.

685
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,759
I forgot to bring my identification.

686
00:33:32,279 --> 00:33:34,039
Mr. Liang came over to help me.

687
00:33:34,519 --> 00:33:36,480
A few patrolmen were pestering Miss Xie.

688
00:33:37,119 --> 00:33:38,559
So I revealed my identity.

689
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:40,039
And scared them off a bit.

690
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:42,000
When did you

691
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,480
start playing the hero to save the damsel?

692
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:46,880
It was nothing, just a small favor.

693
00:33:47,319 --> 00:33:48,440
If it were you, Brother Cui,

694
00:33:48,519 --> 00:33:50,119
you would have helped too.

695
00:33:52,519 --> 00:33:53,319
After we met,

696
00:33:53,319 --> 00:33:53,759
after we met,

697
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,319
Mr. Liang kept asking me out.

698
00:33:56,839 --> 00:33:58,319
Eventually, I agreed.

699
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,160
We had arranged to meet

700
00:34:00,319 --> 00:34:02,839
on the morning of the 26th last month.

701
00:34:03,319 --> 00:34:04,720
But he didn't show up.

702
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,240
Come in.

703
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,000
Let's talk inside.

704
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:21,079
How's the situation?

705
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:22,280
He's out of danger.

706
00:34:23,079 --> 00:34:24,880
Miss Xie has temporarily sent him to

707
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,079
the Japanese Army Hospital.

708
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,280
The only concern now

709
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,719
is Hirata Xizi.

710
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:32,400
She might become suspicious of Miss Xie's identity.

711
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,199
We have to trust Liang Shuo.

712
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:36,559
He'll definitely find a way

713
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:37,880
to handle it.

714
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,079
By the way,

715
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:40,880
Liang Shuo has important information to pass on.

716
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:43,280
Tell Old Tan

717
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,119
the time has changed.

718
00:34:46,559 --> 00:34:47,800
It's moved up by two days.

719
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:50,480
Three-One.

720
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:52,480
The Three-One Plan.

721
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,079
There's no time left.

722
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:00,440
No wonder

723
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,840
As soon as the award ceremony ended

724
00:35:03,639 --> 00:35:05,400
he went straight to Pingchuan Academy

725
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,320
What he means

726
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,480
should be

727
00:35:11,639 --> 00:35:13,440
the Japanese want to move it up by two days

728
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,719
and hold the peace conference

729
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,079
The location has also changed

730
00:35:16,559 --> 00:35:18,800
This completely disrupts our previous plan

731
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,840
The 3-1 Plan

732
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,039
What exactly is it?

733
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,480
The peace conference

734
00:35:25,719 --> 00:35:27,360
is far from as simple as it seems

735
00:35:27,679 --> 00:35:28,599
Behind it

736
00:35:30,119 --> 00:35:31,519
there must be an even bigger plot

737
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,719
We don't have much time left

738
00:35:38,679 --> 00:35:39,480
At least

739
00:35:41,079 --> 00:35:43,320
the first step of our mission is now complete

740
00:35:44,039 --> 00:35:45,280
As long as Liang Shuo

741
00:35:46,239 --> 00:35:48,199
can stay in his position at the Special Investigation Division

742
00:35:48,199 --> 00:35:49,119
without any mistakes

743
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:52,280
he will definitely be able to get to the core of the conference

744
00:35:52,679 --> 00:35:54,280
and we can seize the initiative

745
00:35:55,679 --> 00:35:58,280
If we want Hirata Xizi not to notice anything

746
00:35:58,599 --> 00:35:59,719
and avoid any mistakes

747
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,679
that's easier said than done

748
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,800
What does Miss Xie do?

749
00:36:11,239 --> 00:36:12,519
She just graduated from a girls' school.

750
00:36:13,039 --> 00:36:14,719
She’s currently working part-time at a clothing store.

751
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:17,199
So you haven’t known each other for long?

752
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,119
Not long.

753
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,760
We’ve only met a few times.

754
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,400
That was before you went to Yulongshan?

755
00:36:24,679 --> 00:36:25,599
That’s when we met.

756
00:36:26,679 --> 00:36:27,360
That’s right.

757
00:36:29,679 --> 00:36:30,599
So today...

758
00:36:31,639 --> 00:36:33,599
Today, he finally managed to ask me out again.

759
00:36:33,719 --> 00:36:35,480
We agreed to have coffee together.

760
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,599
But then something like that happened again.

761
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,519
It scared me to death.

762
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,599
We were just meeting for coffee.

763
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:42,639
I didn’t expect

764
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,760
anti-Japanese activists would ruin our mood.

765
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,559
I didn’t expect Miss Xie

766
00:36:48,199 --> 00:36:49,559
to have such a good memory.

767
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,960
If it’s someone or something I want to remember,

768
00:36:52,159 --> 00:36:53,360
of course I can remember it.

769
00:36:56,159 --> 00:36:57,559
You just graduated.

770
00:36:59,559 --> 00:37:00,840
I just started at the clothing store.

771
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,599
I found a temporary job there.

772
00:37:03,639 --> 00:37:05,280
Miss Xie, can you guarantee

773
00:37:05,639 --> 00:37:07,039
that everything you’ve said

774
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,559
is true?

775
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:09,800
Of course.

776
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,639
Why would I lie to you?

777
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:15,159
Where are you living now, Miss Xie?

778
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,960
I’m renting a place at 16 Chunhua Road.

779
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,960
Thank you for your cooperation, Miss Xie.

780
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,079
If I was in any way impolite,

781
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:31,679
please forgive me.

782
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,519
May I leave now?

783
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,559
Please.

784
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,800
I hope I'm not interrupting your conversation.

785
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:52,360
Director Hirata, you're joking.

786
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:53,599
Brother Liang and I

787
00:37:53,719 --> 00:37:54,719
were just chatting about everyday things.

788
00:37:58,800 --> 00:37:59,639
Brother Cui,

789
00:38:00,039 --> 00:38:01,000
Director Hirata,

790
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,760
Since you are both here,

791
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:05,119
I'd like to ask you both for a favor.

792
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,159
Please, just tell us what you need.

793
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:08,159
No need to be so polite.

794
00:38:08,159 --> 00:38:08,920
Director Liang,

795
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,400
you're being too polite.

796
00:38:10,559 --> 00:38:11,199
Just give the word,

797
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,159
and I'll do as you ask.

798
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:13,719
Then, Brother Cui,

799
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,360
could you bring me my coat?

800
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:27,760
Thank you.

801
00:38:30,559 --> 00:38:31,960
I asked you out today,

802
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,599
but I didn't expect

803
00:38:34,559 --> 00:38:36,079
that you would be frightened.

804
00:38:37,719 --> 00:38:38,760
It all happened so suddenly

805
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,599
that what I wanted to say to you at the café

806
00:38:40,599 --> 00:38:41,599
I didn't get the chance to say.

807
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:43,199
I didn't have time to say any of it.

808
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,400
But after what happened,

809
00:38:47,159 --> 00:38:49,159
it has only strengthened my resolve.

810
00:38:51,039 --> 00:38:51,880
That is,

811
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,360
I don't want to have any regrets.

812
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:56,480
Our time together has been short,

813
00:38:57,039 --> 00:38:58,400
but it's been unforgettable.

814
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:01,760
Maybe what happened today

815
00:39:02,039 --> 00:39:03,400
was a bit rushed,

816
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,800
but I have thought it through carefully.

817
00:39:08,559 --> 00:39:10,159
Director Hirata,

818
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:11,960
and Brother Cui,

819
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,320
please be my witnesses.

820
00:39:31,159 --> 00:39:32,559
What are you doing?

821
00:39:33,559 --> 00:39:35,400
Facing the unknown risks ahead,

822
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:38,000
I am willing to be your strongest armor,

823
00:39:38,119 --> 00:39:39,159
to protect you completely.

824
00:39:40,679 --> 00:39:41,360
Yuxin,

825
00:39:42,039 --> 00:39:44,719
are you willing to give me this chance?

826
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:51,199
This gift is too valuable.

827
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:52,880
I can't accept it.

828
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,360
Director Hirata and Brother Cui

829
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,960
have both witnessed this for me.

830
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,159
Are you not giving them any respect?

831
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:05,119
Of course not.

832
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,320
Then you must not like me.

833
00:40:07,679 --> 00:40:08,760
That's definitely not it either.

834
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:11,840
Miss Xie,

835
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,920
what Brother Liang just said

836
00:40:14,159 --> 00:40:15,559
was truly heartfelt and sincere.

837
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:18,199
With my brother's status

838
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:19,559
and his looks,

839
00:40:20,159 --> 00:40:21,760
in all of Shanghai,

840
00:40:22,119 --> 00:40:24,159
countless women long for him but can't have him.

841
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,400
Don't miss out on such a good match.

842
00:40:58,239 --> 00:40:59,119
Mr. Liang

843
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:00,880
You usually act swiftly and decisively.

844
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:02,079
I didn't expect

845
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,280
that when it comes to relationships,

846
00:41:03,519 --> 00:41:04,559
you'd be just as resolute.

847
00:41:05,079 --> 00:41:06,119
In the past,

848
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:08,000
I was always focused on my work.

849
00:41:08,639 --> 00:41:10,519
I never considered personal matters.

850
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:12,119
But now,

851
00:41:12,719 --> 00:41:14,320
thanks to Director Hirata's support,

852
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,159
I've been promoted to Deputy Director.

853
00:41:17,159 --> 00:41:18,559
I'm also taking this opportunity

854
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,079
to express my feelings to Miss Xie.

855
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,400
to let her know what's in my heart.

856
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,960
It's also a way to give myself closure.

857
00:41:26,039 --> 00:41:28,159
Thank you, Director Hirata, for your understanding.

858
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,119
Of course I understand.

859
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:31,519
Family matters and national affairs

860
00:41:31,519 --> 00:41:32,559
are equally important.

861
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,159
Without family, there is no country.

862
00:41:34,639 --> 00:41:35,440
Miss Xie,

863
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:37,719
it seems very soon

864
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:39,760
I'll have to start calling you sister-in-law.

865
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:44,679
You two go ahead and talk.

866
00:41:44,679 --> 00:41:45,920
I'll go get some hot water.
