1
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:07,439
Your

2
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,919
name

3
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,000
Your

4
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,599
name

5
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,479
Name

6
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:26,599
Don't know

7
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,639
Your true identity

8
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,479
Are you a Chongqing agent

9
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:31,560
Are you a Chongqing agent

10
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:38,360
What do you mean

11
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:42,000
Who is Shadow

12
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:43,840
Shadow

13
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:48,000
Who is it

14
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,560
Who are you really

15
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,439
What's your name

16
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:52,319
What's my name

17
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:53,919
What's my name

18
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:55,479
What's my name

19
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,800
What's my name

20
00:02:58,639 --> 00:02:59,800
What's going on

21
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,680
Something's not right, is it

22
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:03,439
It shouldn't be

23
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,080
How did it end up like this

24
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,800
Don't you think

25
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,479
there's a problem

26
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:13,680
First trial of the new drug

27
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,560
It could be a side effect

28
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,159
Hurry

29
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:24,520
Tell me your name

30
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,919
Tell me your name

31
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:27,199
Your age

32
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,439
Position

33
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,639
Relatives, friends

34
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,479
Say everything you remember

35
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:34,319
Say it

36
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,479
Takagi

37
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,960
It's already like this

38
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:39,000
What else can you ask

39
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:40,719
Idiot

40
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:47,520
You all carry on.

41
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,159
Yes.

42
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,000
We've already investigated.

43
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,039
We've also interrogated.

44
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,879
Why are we still holding him?

45
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:06,759
Mr. Mizuno's reason is

46
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:07,800
to assist with the investigation.

47
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,039
But Asai Hisashi is already dead.

48
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:14,159
The whereabouts of the list have become a mystery.

49
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:16,040
This Mizuno...

50
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:18,040
doesn't want us to get

51
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,199
even the slightest bit of information.

52
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:21,319
Yes.

53
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:22,959
But as for Meihuatang,

54
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:23,959
their reasons are solid.

55
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:25,879
If we want to intervene,

56
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,639
it really is difficult.

57
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,519
Difficult.

58
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:30,040
Liang Shuo is one of ours.

59
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,399
Did he consult me beforehand?

60
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,319
Director.

61
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:33,160
Please calm down.

62
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:37,600
Go.

63
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,720
Call Director Zhou.

64
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:41,120
Have him, in the name of the Executive Committee,

65
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,199
negotiate with Meihuatang.

66
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:43,399
Yes.

67
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:52,240
It must be a problem with the dosage.

68
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,040
Even if Liang Shuo leaves the interrogation room,

69
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,399
he'll be a ruined man.

70
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,399
The clues to the 31 List

71
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,160
are really gone.

72
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:02,120
Chief.

73
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,800
Go over Asai Hisashi's escape route

74
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,879
one more time.

75
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:07,480
Maybe we'll find something new.

76
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,439
There's no other way, right?

77
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:12,600
Report.

78
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:19,759
Just now

79
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:22,000
The Special Affairs Committee called

80
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:24,279
They asked

81
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:25,759
about Director Liang's situation

82
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:31,839
and want us to return him to them

83
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,120
They got the news pretty quickly

84
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:36,079
Chief

85
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:37,319
How should we handle Liang Shuo?

86
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,399
He has the 31 List now

87
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,639
Tell them

88
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,000
Liang Shuo is an anti-Japanese element

89
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Go see your uncle

90
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,279
He’s been taken to the Navy Department

91
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:51,480
Let’s see who can save him

92
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:52,920
Yes

93
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:55,839
Chief

94
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,199
How should I respond then?

95
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:03,560
Idiot

96
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,240
Let them

97
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,199
go to the military department to ask for him themselves

98
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:06,839
Yes

99
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,439
It's a complete mess out there.

100
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:45,120
Yeah.

101
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:47,560
A lot of shops have been raided by the Japanese military police.

102
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,519
I heard those bastards

103
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:50,839
didn't even spare the residential houses.

104
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:52,800
In broad daylight,

105
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,199
no one dares to open for business.

106
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:55,319
Uncle Hai,

107
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:56,839
are you delivering goods to the pharmacy today?

108
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:58,160
Delivering goods?

109
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,439
Look at me, how could I still be delivering anything?

110
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:02,560
If I got killed

111
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,360
and lost my head

112
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,920
by those Japanese devils just for delivering goods,

113
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,160
who would I complain to?

114
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,839
These times

115
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:08,920
are really frightening.

116
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:09,959
Where's Old Tan?

117
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,560
He's inside.

118
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,600
Be careful.

119
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,000
I've asked around.

120
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,199
The Japanese didn't get

121
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:20,560
any information about the list from them.

122
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:21,680
That's why they sent so many soldiers

123
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,959
to conduct a thorough search.

124
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,279
It's a bad thing,

125
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,800
but also a good thing.

126
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:28,519
At least it shows

127
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,879
Mizuno Shingen

128
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:30,759
is now

129
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:31,959
at the end of his rope.

130
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,879
Any news about Qingshuang?

131
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:40,160
No news since she entered the Plum Blossom Hall.

132
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,480
One of my guys said

133
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:42,720
that today, inside the Plum Blossom Hall,

134
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,160
they sent out the body of an anti-Japanese activist.

135
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,639
It was taken to the mass grave behind the hill.

136
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,839
According to his description,

137
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,160
it should be Lu Xijian.

138
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,279
I don't know.

139
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,120
Shanghai now,

140
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:58,439
how much power does the Military Bureau still have?

141
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:00,519
Who knows?

142
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:01,839
The Military Bureau in Shanghai

143
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:03,160
is probably finished for good.

144
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,199
Miss Xie.

145
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:06,199
How is the situation?

146
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,279
Still unconscious.

147
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:08,959
But out of danger now.

148
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:11,120
Should we rescue her?

149
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,439
First, we need to find a way

150
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:14,480
to contact Qingshuang.

151
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,800
I'm afraid that's difficult.

152
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,959
He's been put under house arrest by Mizuno Shingen.

153
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:20,480
Because of the Asai Hisashi incident,

154
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,959
Mizuno Shingen no longer trusts anyone.

155
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:25,920
Comrade Qingshuang

156
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:28,000
is our only hope now.

157
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:29,920
We must find a way to protect him.

158
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,439
No matter the cost.

159
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,759
I'll keep watch near Meihua Hall then.

160
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:35,879
Be fully prepared.

161
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:36,960
If there's any danger,

162
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:37,919
I'll provide backup at any time.

163
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,639
Wait a moment.

164
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,120
It's better to send someone.

165
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,240
As for Miss Xie,

166
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,399
be ready to move her at any time.

167
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:47,360
You handle the arrangements.

168
00:08:47,879 --> 00:08:48,480
Okay.

169
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:32,200
What's going on?

170
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:33,399
Message confirmed.

171
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,639
Thank you, sir.

172
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:35,759
He has already died for the country.

173
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:38,840
No.

174
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:40,200
Taking such a risk—

175
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,399
I absolutely disagree.

176
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:42,559
Warfare is about deception.

177
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:44,720
But not about reckless moves.

178
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:47,159
Otherwise, we'll lose completely.

179
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:48,039
Just say it directly.

180
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,480
Doing this—

181
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,360
How confident are you?

182
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:51,879
Thirty percent.

183
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:53,600
I'm afraid not even that.

184
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,879
We have no other choice.

185
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,679
Paying such a high price for your gamble—

186
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,240
Can you afford to lose?

187
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:03,200
So—

188
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,440
You have to stay until the end.

189
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,759
If I lose—

190
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,480
You'll still have a chance.

191
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:12,080
You know best

192
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,000
what I care about.

193
00:10:18,039 --> 00:10:18,879
Sir.

194
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:19,960
What should we do now?

195
00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:22,480
Send the remaining personnel

196
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,600
all out.

197
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:25,279
Find Liang Shuo's whereabouts.

198
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,519
Yes, sir.

199
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:53,960
Director Liang

200
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:55,840
Please.

201
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,159
Let's go.

202
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,759
Our request was denied.

203
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,480
Director Liang has been confirmed as an anti-Japanese element.

204
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:24,600
Chief Mizuno said

205
00:13:24,919 --> 00:13:26,679
the person has already been sent to the Navy Department.

206
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:28,080
Alright.

207
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:29,679
Very good.

208
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,480
They're using this excuse to brush us off.

209
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,679
Calling him an anti-Japanese element?

210
00:13:35,159 --> 00:13:36,519
If he really were an anti-Japanese element,

211
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:39,399
Liang Shuo should have been executed together with Lu Xijian.

212
00:13:40,039 --> 00:13:42,320
What right does Mizuno have to do this?

213
00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:44,360
Chief.

214
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,320
Aren't you worried that Director Liang

215
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,679
might really be suspected of collaborating with the Communists?

216
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:50,320
Old Liu,

217
00:13:51,559 --> 00:13:53,720
why are you speaking up for Mizuno?

218
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,159
Whether Liang Shuo is with the Military Bureau

219
00:13:56,159 --> 00:13:57,039
or the Communists,

220
00:13:57,039 --> 00:13:58,840
it's still our own business.

221
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,399
Even if he must die,

222
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,360
he should die

223
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,600
in our Special Operations Headquarters' interrogation room.

224
00:14:03,879 --> 00:14:04,720
Yes, yes.

225
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,519
Chief.

226
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,559
I sent someone to inquire.

227
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:10,919
Liang Shuo is still there and hasn't been transferred yet.

228
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:12,960
Send someone to keep watch first.

229
00:14:15,919 --> 00:14:16,919
The action team—

230
00:14:16,919 --> 00:14:18,200
Isn't there a Yu Dahu?

231
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,320
Have him lead the team.

232
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,919
Make sure to intercept him for me.

233
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:24,879
As for what comes next,

234
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,440
I'll negotiate with Mizuno myself.

235
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:28,000
Yes.

236
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,080
Captain Yu.

237
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,120
Why isn't anyone moving?

238
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,039
Step out.

239
00:14:43,159 --> 00:14:43,879
Captain Yu.

240
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,600
Why are we stepping out?

241
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,000
I heard that Director Liang, he...

242
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,320
Enough talk.

243
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Step out.

244
00:14:59,559 --> 00:15:00,200
Lao Bai.

245
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,639
We're stepping out. Are you coming?

246
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:07,799
Lao Bai.

247
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,320
You know me.

248
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,399
And you know him too.

249
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:03,960
Who are you talking about?

250
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:05,879
He is Maple.

251
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:07,679
Then who are you?

252
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:09,440
Comrade Qingshuang.

253
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:11,159
Welcome home.

254
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:13,000
I am Qingshuang.

255
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,399
Comrade Qingshuang.

256
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,159
I am your comrade-in-arms.

257
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,320
Looks like you've been at No. 76 for too long.

258
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,440
You've lost all your spirit.

259
00:16:26,679 --> 00:16:27,840
You must always remember,

260
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,440
you are the shadow of the Military Bureau.

261
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,440
The interests of the Party and the nation are above all else.

262
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,440
Brother Liang, oh Brother Liang.

263
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:35,519
You're already back.

264
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:36,759
Why didn't you let me know you were safe?

265
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,559
Do you know during this time,

266
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,399
your men and I

267
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:41,840
have been getting by?

268
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,160
The mission.

269
00:17:09,799 --> 00:17:10,960
You must be clear

270
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,160
about what the mission is.

271
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,559
Complete it.

272
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,000
Do your utmost.

273
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,200
Even if it costs your life.

274
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,400
Only you can complete the Abyss mission.

275
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,599
No one can replace you.

276
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,039
What are you doing?

277
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:46,599
Sit down.

278
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,359
Stop!

279
00:17:56,599 --> 00:17:57,480
Stop.

280
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,440
Something's happening.

281
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:03,000
Why are they even firing guns?

282
00:18:04,279 --> 00:18:05,440
This isn't an arrest.

283
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,480
This is murder.

284
00:18:06,839 --> 00:18:07,440
Let's go.

285
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:08,440
Let's go take a look.

286
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,119
Go.

287
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,720
Hurry and inform Director Mizuno.

288
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,519
Understood.

289
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,640
V stands for Victory Park

290
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,319
The maple leaf represents inside Victory Park

291
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,480
The diary under the maple tree

292
00:19:24,119 --> 00:19:25,480
Victory Park

293
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,279
Maple leaf

294
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:29,559
Must never be forgotten

295
00:19:46,839 --> 00:19:47,960
Chief

296
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,559
We've searched everywhere

297
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:52,160
Asai Ju has ever been

298
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:54,279
but found no

299
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,319
clues at all

300
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:58,279
Luckily, I

301
00:19:58,279 --> 00:20:01,039
didn't have much hope anyway

302
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:03,480
If such a stupid method worked

303
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,640
there would be no need for agents

304
00:20:06,359 --> 00:20:07,160
Yes

305
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,240
What's the current situation?

306
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,400
We need to get back to the key point

307
00:20:11,559 --> 00:20:13,240
The list must still be in Shanghai

308
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:15,359
Senior Asai

309
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:16,880
The list

310
00:20:17,559 --> 00:20:19,839
Check all of Senior Asai's

311
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:21,200
social connections in Shanghai

312
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,480
Alright

313
00:20:26,519 --> 00:20:27,279
Report

314
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:31,720
Chief

315
00:20:31,799 --> 00:20:32,759
News from Meihua Hall

316
00:20:32,759 --> 00:20:34,319
Liang Shuo knocked out the guards

317
00:20:34,759 --> 00:20:35,359
and escaped

318
00:20:36,359 --> 00:20:37,160
Takagi

319
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:40,240
We all miscalculated

320
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:43,880
Could he be the Shadow?

321
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,559
It must be him

322
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:48,880
How did he

323
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,240
manage to stay conscious?

324
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:53,880
Where did he escape to?

325
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,039
Just three blocks ahead

326
00:20:57,599 --> 00:20:59,880
Alright, take a team and go reinforce immediately

327
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:00,880
Be sure to

328
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:01,960
find Liang Shuo

329
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:02,559
Yes, sir

330
00:21:37,319 --> 00:21:38,200
Maple leaf

331
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,440
Just tell me what you want to record

332
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,440
I'll help you write it

333
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,279
But

334
00:22:04,599 --> 00:22:05,920
we need to find a safe place

335
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,359
There's an old maple tree

336
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:12,640
A hidden spot under its roots

337
00:22:13,359 --> 00:22:15,119
Just hide it under the roots

338
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:16,440
Okay

339
00:22:16,839 --> 00:22:18,279
Leave it to me from now on

340
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:16,880
He's inside.

341
00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:18,599
Surround this place.

342
00:23:18,599 --> 00:23:19,319
Hurry!

343
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,359
He's over there.

344
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,400
Come in.

345
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:34,839
How is it?

346
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:37,200
Qingshuang escaped from Meihua Hall.

347
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:37,759
Now the whole street

348
00:23:37,759 --> 00:23:39,240
is full of military police searching for him.

349
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,839
Escaping at this time

350
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:44,000
isn't that exposing his identity?

351
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,559
Why would he lose his composure like this?

352
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:48,079
Could it be

353
00:23:48,079 --> 00:23:49,400
that his life is in danger?

354
00:23:53,319 --> 00:23:54,119
Zhonghai.

355
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:55,519
Take some people right away

356
00:23:55,519 --> 00:23:56,279
and go to the hospital.

357
00:23:56,319 --> 00:23:57,160
Find a way

358
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,759
to get Miss Xie out.

359
00:23:58,759 --> 00:23:59,200
Okay.

360
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,279
I'll contact the special operations team.

361
00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:01,000
See if they can

362
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:01,920
support Qingshuang.

363
00:24:02,359 --> 00:24:02,920
Alright.

364
00:24:28,839 --> 00:24:29,640
Stop!

365
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:31,640
What are you doing?

366
00:24:32,839 --> 00:24:33,759
Ward Eleven.

367
00:24:34,119 --> 00:24:35,160
Delivering some food.

368
00:24:35,359 --> 00:24:36,160
Take a detour.

369
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,559
Why?

370
00:24:37,759 --> 00:24:39,119
Why so many questions?

371
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:40,519
Just take the detour.

372
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:47,839
What are you looking at?

373
00:24:47,839 --> 00:24:48,279
Let's go.

374
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:53,519
Stop.

375
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,039
What's this?

376
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,960
This is food for the patient.

377
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:00,559
What are you doing?

378
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:01,480
Open it, let me see.

379
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,039
What are you doing?

380
00:25:02,279 --> 00:25:03,279
I'm changing the dressing.

381
00:25:03,319 --> 00:25:04,400
If the patient dies, it's on you.

382
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:07,759
Go in.

383
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:12,559
Let's go.

384
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:17,880
What happened just now?

385
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:18,519
It's nothing.

386
00:25:18,759 --> 00:25:19,519
Just changing the dressing.

387
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:20,519
You two.

388
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:21,240
Where's the patient?

389
00:25:35,319 --> 00:25:36,720
We left through the side door by the operating room.

390
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,640
Someone was waiting for us there.

391
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,039
Go.

392
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,000
Hurry.

393
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,240
Go.

394
00:25:59,359 --> 00:25:59,960
Come.

395
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:00,599
Go.

396
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:03,519
Come.

397
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,279
Hurry.

398
00:26:57,079 --> 00:26:58,519
Ma Zi, what do you mean?

399
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,319
He's now an anti-Japanese activist.

400
00:27:07,799 --> 00:27:09,319
Then I’m a Communist, too.

401
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:12,920
Fine.

402
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,559
So this is how you want to play it?

403
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:19,359
There are both elders and children here.

404
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,920
If the higher-ups find out,

405
00:27:21,079 --> 00:27:22,359
can you really stay out of trouble?

406
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:36,960
Ma Zi.

407
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,359
Have you seen Liang Shuo?

408
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,440
I asked if you’ve seen Liang Shuo.

409
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:10,720
Chief Takagi is talking to us.

410
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:11,799
What else would it be?

411
00:28:13,599 --> 00:28:15,000
No, that’s not it.

412
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:16,680
Chief Takagi.

413
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,000
Our Director Liang

414
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,400
wasn’t he detained by Director Mizuno?

415
00:28:20,839 --> 00:28:22,759
So why are you asking us for him?

416
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,079
Then why are you here?

417
00:28:28,279 --> 00:28:29,200
Routine inspection.

418
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:30,720
Sorry to bother you.

419
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:44,759
Let’s go.

420
00:29:16,599 --> 00:29:17,400
Listen.

421
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:18,599
Hang in there for me.

422
00:29:18,599 --> 00:29:19,759
You must survive.

423
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:20,799
Complete the mission.

424
00:29:21,799 --> 00:29:22,599
Stand up.

425
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:23,680
Draw your gun.

426
00:29:24,039 --> 00:29:24,880
Draw your gun.

427
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:26,720
Draw your gun.

428
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,000
Pick up the gun.

429
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,079
Can't draw the gun.

430
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:33,920
You'll end up like them.

431
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,200
Do you remember

432
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,880
what I told you?

433
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,359
Life is not just about surviving.

434
00:29:41,759 --> 00:29:43,319
It's about seeking light and forging your soul.

435
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,559
Be determined to pass on the torch.

436
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:45,839
Every breath

437
00:29:46,079 --> 00:29:47,160
is for faith.

438
00:29:47,359 --> 00:29:48,160
Every step

439
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,599
is for progress.

440
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,200
We should use

441
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,839
our original intention to light the way ahead.

442
00:29:53,319 --> 00:29:54,119
With our mission

443
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,279
we forge our character.

444
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:56,559
With perseverance

445
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,480
we seek the light.

446
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,519
While we were

447
00:30:06,599 --> 00:30:08,359
pursuing Liang Shuo,

448
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,759
three nurses rescued Xie Nianci.

449
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,240
I underestimated them.

450
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:40,000
Liang Shuo and the Military Bureau.

451
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:41,799
I didn't expect them

452
00:30:41,799 --> 00:30:43,240
to use a diversion to help someone escape.

453
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,559
Right now, I just want to know

454
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:49,920
where he escaped to.

455
00:30:50,359 --> 00:30:52,359
Hundreds of people couldn't catch an injured Liang Shuo.

456
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,920
What's going on?

457
00:30:56,079 --> 00:30:57,160
It was my failure.

458
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,440
Based on the blood traces,

459
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:01,799
we've pinpointed

460
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,960
his last known location.

461
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,279
That area

462
00:31:06,279 --> 00:31:07,880
has hundreds of households.

463
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,799
We've searched everywhere but still haven't found him.

464
00:31:10,279 --> 00:31:11,200
We can't rule out

465
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,440
that someone helped him.

466
00:31:13,319 --> 00:31:14,240
Most likely,

467
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,160
he was

468
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:18,480
moved by someone else.

469
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,440
That's unlikely.

470
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,960
I've already wiped out the Military Bureau.

471
00:31:24,839 --> 00:31:26,359
How could they still have the strength to help?

472
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,359
We've already expanded the search area.

473
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,839
We'll report to you immediately if there's any news.

474
00:31:31,319 --> 00:31:32,200
Takagi.

475
00:31:32,759 --> 00:31:33,759
Be more careful.

476
00:31:36,079 --> 00:31:37,400
Don't just see the tree

477
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,519
and think it's the whole forest.

478
00:31:39,079 --> 00:31:39,720
Yes.

479
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:41,359
I'm counting on you.

480
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:57,960
Water.

481
00:31:59,160 --> 00:31:59,920
Old Chen, water.

482
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,279
I want some water.

483
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:01,880
Here.

484
00:32:03,559 --> 00:32:04,359
Slow down.

485
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:08,079
Here, the water's here.

486
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Here.

487
00:32:26,039 --> 00:32:27,000
Comrade Qingshuang

488
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:29,519
How are you feeling?

489
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,680
Comrade Qingshuang

490
00:32:36,519 --> 00:32:37,599
Are you calling me?

491
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:40,400
I know

492
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:42,680
Do I know you?

493
00:32:46,599 --> 00:32:47,960
I should have thought of that.

494
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,559
An old injury has flared up.

495
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,240
You really

496
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,079
can't remember anything.

497
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,200
But fortunately,

498
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,599
you're safe now.

499
00:33:00,279 --> 00:33:01,359
Where are my things?

500
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,640
Are you looking for this?

501
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:21,199
Comrade Qingshuang

502
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:22,719
This is what you need.

503
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:23,880
The Communist Manifesto

504
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,079
The Communist Manifesto

505
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:38,559
This must not be discovered by anyone.

506
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,119
I know.

507
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,880
Use it as your codebook.

508
00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:43,239
Even if you forget,

509
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:44,159
I believe

510
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,000
you will still find your faith.

511
00:35:07,559 --> 00:35:08,800
That's about it.

512
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:09,599
Okay.

513
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,360
I have recorded your identity and mission

514
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,960
in Morse code.

515
00:35:13,039 --> 00:35:14,360
I'll write you another copy

516
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,360
on how to decipher Morse code.

517
00:35:16,559 --> 00:35:17,519
Just in case.

518
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:07,559
I am Qing Shuang, a member of the Communist Party.

519
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:10,400
I am not a Military Intelligence shadow.

520
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,079
Victory that comes too easily

521
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,639
can make people lose their way.

522
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,599
We were still too impatient.

523
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:32,079
I have checked repeatedly.

524
00:36:32,159 --> 00:36:33,679
There is nothing of value.

525
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,960
If it were truly valuable,

526
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:38,039
would you have found it so easily?

527
00:36:45,159 --> 00:36:46,679
This is

528
00:36:51,639 --> 00:36:52,559
U.S. dollars.

529
00:36:52,559 --> 00:36:53,599
In these chaotic times,

530
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,760
they are hard currency.

531
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:58,159
Since Asai Shou arrived in Shanghai,

532
00:36:58,159 --> 00:37:00,440
he has been under our control.

533
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,639
He didn't have any U.S. dollars on him.

534
00:37:01,639 --> 00:37:04,599
He must have exchanged them after Asai-senpai escaped.

535
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:05,840
But

536
00:37:06,239 --> 00:37:07,039
at a time like this,

537
00:37:07,039 --> 00:37:09,159
there are hardly any places in Shanghai to exchange money.

538
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,119
Where did he exchange it?

539
00:37:13,239 --> 00:37:15,000
After he escaped,

540
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,239
he kept wandering around the Siming Road area.

541
00:37:18,559 --> 00:37:20,119
I know that place.

542
00:37:20,119 --> 00:37:22,599
There's a Citibank there.

543
00:37:26,159 --> 00:37:28,159
You know what to do now, right?

544
00:37:32,159 --> 00:37:34,280
Newspapers for sale! Newspapers for sale!

545
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,719
Newspapers for sale! Newspapers for sale!

546
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,239
Come here, child.

547
00:37:38,239 --> 00:37:39,199
Selling newspapers.

548
00:37:39,239 --> 00:37:40,079
Buy a newspaper.

549
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,440
Newspapers for sale! Newspapers for sale!

550
00:37:57,159 --> 00:37:59,119
Newspapers for sale! Newspapers for sale!

551
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:11,880
You are Old Tan.

552
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,000
You remember now.

553
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:17,679
A little.

554
00:38:18,719 --> 00:38:20,000
But the diary says

555
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,800
I should trust you.

556
00:38:22,599 --> 00:38:23,880
I am one of you.

557
00:38:24,559 --> 00:38:25,440
Codename.

558
00:38:25,719 --> 00:38:26,480
Qingshuang.

559
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,440
I have to complete a mission.

560
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:31,199
The Abyss Plan.

561
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:34,039
I need to find a list.

562
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,639
A very important list.

563
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,400
It concerns the Sino-Japanese war situation.

564
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,840
I have many identities.

565
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,000
But

566
00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:43,840
Only one belief.

567
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,840
I lost someone very important.

568
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:50,760
We are all the same.

569
00:38:55,559 --> 00:38:56,800
A girl.

570
00:38:57,239 --> 00:38:58,760
Helped me get this mark.

571
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,199
She was injured.

572
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,360
On the way to northern Jiangsu.

573
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:05,760
Don't worry.

574
00:39:06,559 --> 00:39:07,559
The organization

575
00:39:08,159 --> 00:39:09,719
will do everything to heal her.

576
00:39:11,039 --> 00:39:11,840
Yan'an.

577
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:13,639
Yan'an.

578
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:18,639
Then why did they all sacrifice themselves

579
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,599
while I am still alive?

580
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:26,800
Being alive

581
00:39:28,039 --> 00:39:28,960
sometimes

582
00:39:29,639 --> 00:39:31,239
is harder than dying.

583
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,119
We can only

584
00:39:34,679 --> 00:39:36,039
on this difficult path

585
00:39:36,039 --> 00:39:37,400
keep going with determination.

586
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:38,639
This way,

587
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:40,159
our fallen comrades

588
00:39:40,639 --> 00:39:42,320
won't have died in vain.

589
00:39:53,159 --> 00:39:54,320
I understand.

590
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,320
I will do whatever it takes.

591
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:59,360
To find the list that was left behind.

592
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,079
But I really

593
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:08,840
can only remember a little bit each time.

594
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,199
What else can you remember?

595
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,440
Wang Mutian betrayed us.

596
00:40:16,639 --> 00:40:18,199
The Shanghai station was completely wiped out.

597
00:40:19,079 --> 00:40:20,079
Mr. Liu said

598
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,559
the Japanese had already

599
00:40:21,559 --> 00:40:23,519
finished making a list several years ago.

600
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:25,639
The 31 List.

601
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,760
Your intelligence

602
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,079
where exactly did it come from?

603
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:31,119
All I know is

604
00:40:31,719 --> 00:40:33,079
Kazuo Nakayama

605
00:40:33,519 --> 00:40:35,719
he knows about a piece of classified information.

606
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,159
What kind of information is it?

607
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,320
A list.

608
00:40:41,519 --> 00:40:42,480
Where is the list?

609
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:43,840
Where is the list?

610
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:47,239
Find Kobayashi Heqing.

611
00:40:48,639 --> 00:40:50,360
Kobayashi Heqing.

612
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
How is he doing?

613
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,159
In such a short time,

614
00:41:04,199 --> 00:41:05,400
for him to remember everything

615
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,280
is really too difficult.

616
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,440
I've already told him

617
00:41:09,719 --> 00:41:10,519
everything that happened during this time.

618
00:41:10,519 --> 00:41:11,519
I've told him everything.

619
00:41:12,039 --> 00:41:13,159
But after all,

620
00:41:13,639 --> 00:41:15,440
he needs time to slowly process it.

621
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,519
Xie Jun'an

622
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:21,119
left a message saying

623
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,280
the San-yi list is still in Shanghai.

624
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:24,719
But

625
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:26,039
this Kobayashi Heqing

626
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:27,320
who exactly is he?

627
00:41:27,719 --> 00:41:28,760
At the Japanese military headquarters,

628
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:30,199
there is no such person.

629
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:32,400
I also went to ask my friend at the newspaper.

630
00:41:33,559 --> 00:41:36,039
He said that the military academy where Asai Shou graduated

631
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:37,320
once in Shanghai

632
00:41:37,519 --> 00:41:38,480
held secret training classes for young Japanese expatriates.

633
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,960
They organized secret training sessions.

634
00:41:40,119 --> 00:41:41,440
It was in the Siping Road area.

635
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,360
At that time, in the newspapers in Hongkou,

636
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:44,679
there were recruitment notices.

637
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,920
And these young people in the army

638
00:41:47,159 --> 00:41:49,599
were all from prominent families.

639
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,320
Their families were either wealthy or noble.

640
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:53,440
They were the descendants of notable Japanese expatriates.

641
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,199
Can we find the list of names?

642
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:57,639
Impossible.
