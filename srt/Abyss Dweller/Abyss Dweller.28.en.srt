1
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,359
There's new information from Brother Zhonghai.

2
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:53,280
How is it?

3
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,680
Number 76 is on alert.

4
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,239
The escort time has been moved up by half an hour.

5
00:01:58,359 --> 00:01:59,439
This is trouble.

6
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,920
There are probably

7
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,879
about two hours left.

8
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:04,319
Hurry up.

9
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:06,400
Find a way to contact our comrades in Jiangbei.

10
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:06,879
Yes.

11
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,599
Traitor.

12
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,000
I have nothing to say to you.

13
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:15,919
What are you doing?

14
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,439
Director Liang.

15
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,400
Water.

16
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:20,919
I'm not in the mood to drink right now.

17
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,319
I need to go to the restroom.

18
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:23,439
Keep an eye on her.

19
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,319
Yes.

20
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,800
Go see what's going on.

21
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:27,039
You two, keep watch.

22
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:50,240
Excuse me.

23
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:00,520
Has Director Liang come back?

24
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,319
No.

25
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:03,080
He's been gone for quite a while.

26
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:03,960
I've been watching the whole time.

27
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,520
He's gone.

28
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,240
Then hurry up and look for him!

29
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:06,919
Let's go.

30
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:08,280
Director Liang.

31
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,159
What's wrong?

32
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,080
You...

33
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,560
You were gone for so long, Director Liang.

34
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,919
It's rare for the guys to go on a business trip.

35
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,240
I went out to see what local specialties there were.

36
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,639
I just bought some sesame cakes.

37
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:20,879
To treat everyone.

38
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,639
You're too kind, Director Liang.

39
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:23,680
Thank you, Director.

40
00:03:56,199 --> 00:03:57,000
What's going on?

41
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,919
Please make way.

42
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:02,120
What's wrong with the train?

43
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,680
Sorry, sir.

44
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:05,319
Our train has encountered a problem.

45
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,159
The repair crew is already working on it.

46
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,039
Stop.

47
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:12,240
We're transporting an important prisoner.

48
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,520
We can't afford any delays.

49
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,319
How much longer will it take?

50
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:16,199
That's hard to say, sir.

51
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:18,439
The train's steel frame is being welded.

52
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:20,360
It'll take at least one or two hours.

53
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,120
If it's longer, I can't say for sure.

54
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:24,920
Tell your men to hurry up.

55
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:25,800
Alright.

56
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,639
Get moving!

57
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:27,680
Yes, sir.

58
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,920
Notify headquarters immediately.

59
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:41,319
Contact the local team in Changzhou.

60
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,879
Send us two vehicles.

61
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,480
We'll switch to land transport right away.

62
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,399
We should still make it in time.

63
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:50,879
Is that really necessary, Director Liang?

64
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:52,839
It's just a minor incident.

65
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:54,399
We'll report to our superiors.

66
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,439
It's fine to wait a little.

67
00:04:58,839 --> 00:04:59,759
The person we're escorting

68
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,680
is a key criminal wanted by the Nanjing government.

69
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:02,519
The handover time

70
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:04,279
was set by the Special Committee.

71
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,279
If we just wait here

72
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:07,519
and lose time,

73
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:09,879
will you take responsibility?

74
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,279
Director Liang is right.

75
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,839
I'll make arrangements right away.

76
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:19,600
You two, watch the prisoner.

77
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,560
Yes, sir.

78
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,399
Secretary Wang, it's me.

79
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,519
At this time,

80
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:43,560
you should be on the train.

81
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,879
I'm at Changzhou Railway Station.

82
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,480
The train had a sudden malfunction.

83
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:48,720
It probably won't be able to leave for a while.

84
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,079
What kind of malfunction?

85
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,360
I heard the undercarriage broke.

86
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:54,079
To be safe,

87
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,079
I've requested assistance from headquarters.

88
00:05:56,279 --> 00:05:57,600
We'll travel the rest of the way by road.

89
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,720
No issues with the people traveling with you, right?

90
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,040
No.

91
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:02,959
Good.

92
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:04,040
Safety comes first.

93
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:06,279
I'll have our people in Changzhou notified.

94
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:07,879
They'll send a car to the station.

95
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:09,079
They'll coordinate with your operation.

96
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:11,079
I heard Takagi Yuyi

97
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,079
also took people to Changzhou.

98
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,839
Keep a close watch.

99
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:17,120
Don't let the Japanese have a chance to interfere.

100
00:06:17,959 --> 00:06:18,759
Yes.

101
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:23,199
Director.

102
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:28,279
Notify all action teams in Changzhou and Nanjing.

103
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,040
Set up checkpoints on the road from Changzhou to Nanjing.

104
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,519
Stop and inspect all suspicious vehicles.

105
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:35,879
Yes.

106
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,360
Director Liang.

107
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,360
Du Jun, Captain of Changzhou Second Action Team.

108
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,600
Reporting for assignment.

109
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,519
Director Liang.

110
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,680
People from the Changzhou station

111
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,839
are here to pick up the prisoner.

112
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,839
Thank you for your hard work, Captain Du.

113
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:53,519
I've already prepared the car.

114
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:55,399
All team members are at your disposal.

115
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,199
Assemble the team.

116
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:57,879
Yes.

117
00:06:57,879 --> 00:06:58,639
Get in the car.

118
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,920
Take two people with you.

119
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:12,879
Get on this truck and follow me.

120
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:14,839
Director Liang is suspicious.

121
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,040
The train had problems for no apparent reason.

122
00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:18,600
It's always good to be cautious.

123
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:19,560
Hurry up and go.

124
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,160
Okay.

125
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,160
What's going on?

126
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:31,160
Why did he leave?

127
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:31,720
Get in the car, quickly.

128
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,160
Follow them.

129
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,839
Quick, follow the car in front.

130
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,480
What are you trying to do?

131
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
If we don't leave now,

132
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,600
we really won't get another chance.

133
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:46,840
Stop the car.

134
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:55,399
We're from the Changzhou branch of headquarters.

135
00:08:55,399 --> 00:08:56,159
We're on the same side.

136
00:08:56,159 --> 00:08:56,919
Move aside, quickly!

137
00:08:57,879 --> 00:08:59,080
Changzhou branch.

138
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,519
You've got guts, daring to break through the checkpoint.

139
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,000
Chief Gao Mu.

140
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,080
You've misunderstood.

141
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,679
We're escorting a major criminal to Shanghai.

142
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:07,200
We're escorting Jiang Feiman.

143
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,240
Where is the person?

144
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:12,360
Director Liang took the person away.

145
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,799
We don't know what's going on either.

146
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:15,080
That's why we chased all the way here.

147
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,360
You're saying Liang Shuo took the prisoner without permission?

148
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:18,360
Where did he go?

149
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:20,519
He went along this road.

150
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:26,360
What you're doing is pointless.

151
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,519
Do you even know what you're doing?

152
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:31,159
To me,

153
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:34,120
protecting you is what matters most.

154
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:35,519
Don't worry.

155
00:09:35,799 --> 00:09:36,720
I can save you.

156
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,519
I've already planned an escape route.

157
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:42,120
No cars pass by on this road.

158
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:46,200
There was a dirt road just now.

159
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:47,679
Could they have gone that way?

160
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:52,000
It seems he's connected to the Communists.

161
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:53,679
You all follow as well.

162
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:54,320
After them!

163
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:55,200
Got it.

164
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,600
Bastard!

165
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,919
Liang Shuo ran off with the prisoner.

166
00:10:04,039 --> 00:10:04,840
Where's Cui Mo?

167
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:05,879
Tell him to come here.

168
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:06,639
Hurry!

169
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:07,279
Yes, sir.

170
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,159
Take the keys.

171
00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:25,639
Take the gun too.

172
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:28,039
Protect yourself.

173
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,159
Remember,

174
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,159
follow this road,

175
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:31,799
and keep going straight to get out.

176
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:33,960
I'll drive the car in another direction.

177
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:42,080
I don't want to see any more blood.

178
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:42,879
Go, quickly.

179
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:45,440
Li Hanzhi isn't a fool.

180
00:10:46,039 --> 00:10:47,000
You'll be exposed.

181
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:49,879
We've come this far.

182
00:10:49,879 --> 00:10:51,279
There's no way back for us.

183
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:52,039
You've always been calm.

184
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:53,320
How can you be so irrational now?

185
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,039
Rational?

186
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:04,440
I've always been like this.

187
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,919
Why must I always be so cautious?

188
00:11:06,919 --> 00:11:08,039
So rational that I'm cold-blooded.

189
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,519
Yes.

190
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:11,559
I'm the director of Operation Section 76.

191
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:13,600
I'm the deputy director of the Special Affairs Committee.

192
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,080
I wield immense power, able to command the winds and clouds.

193
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,480
But in reality,

194
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,679
I can't actually do anything.

195
00:11:20,039 --> 00:11:21,279
Even who I am,

196
00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:22,559
I've only just found out.

197
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:23,360
Liang Shuo,

198
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:28,360
I can't protect anyone.

199
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,440
I can't even protect a single person around me.

200
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:37,399
Zhao Di,

201
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,480
He Yanjia,

202
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:41,639
and Uncle Yan,

203
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:44,639
they're all dead.

204
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:47,679
They're all dead.

205
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,759
One Maple Leaf has already died.

206
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,919
I don't want to see another Maple Leaf

207
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,559
sacrifice themselves in front of me.

208
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:03,720
Liang Shuo,

209
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,279
calm down.

210
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,000
Listen to me.

211
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,519
Without you,

212
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,240
even more of our comrades would be lost.

213
00:12:15,879 --> 00:12:16,759
Don't forget,

214
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:20,039
there are still two thousand refugee compatriots who need you.

215
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:23,639
It wasn't easy to return to No. 76.

216
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:26,440
The Abyss mission isn't finished yet.

217
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,519
You can't run away.

218
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,639
The you I know,

219
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,639
the person you used to be,

220
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,519
never ran away.

221
00:12:37,159 --> 00:12:38,720
Trying to provoke me won't work.

222
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,600
Dying is easy.

223
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:46,759
It can be as light as a feather,

224
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,240
or as heavy as Mount Tai.

225
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,480
What you carry on your shoulders

226
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:54,759
is more than just my life.

227
00:12:56,039 --> 00:12:57,639
There are thousands upon thousands of Maple Leafs

228
00:12:57,879 --> 00:12:59,840
giving their all for the revolution.

229
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,639
We must, for their sake,

230
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,279
pave a bright road to the future.

231
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:08,240
So they won't have to be like us,

232
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,440
walking in darkness and fear.

233
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,799
Even if that future doesn't include us,

234
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,519
even if our names are eventually forgotten,

235
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:18,159
our efforts and sacrifices

236
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:19,399
will not be meaningless.

237
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:21,960
The future we hope for

238
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,679
will be seen by them on our behalf.

239
00:13:25,399 --> 00:13:26,159
That will be

240
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:29,120
a future of freedom, peace, and democracy.

241
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,480
A brand new China.

242
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,519
Do you still remember

243
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,159
how Uncle Yan sacrificed himself?

244
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:47,879
Right now,

245
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,320
I think I understand

246
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,879
the resolve he had before he died.

247
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,320
Don't be like this.

248
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,919
The meaning of life isn't just to live,

249
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:03,960
but in how you live.

250
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,159
I don't want to force you.

251
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:08,759
I only ask you

252
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,960
to let my death have more meaning.

253
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,000
Get out of the car.

254
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,240
Get out.

255
00:14:40,759 --> 00:14:41,600
See?

256
00:14:41,879 --> 00:14:42,759
I told you,

257
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,519
there's no escape.

258
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,720
I'm going back to see Lao Tan.

259
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,759
If you have anything to say to the organization,

260
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:00,639
our comrades

261
00:15:00,919 --> 00:15:03,039
will help take care of everything.

262
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,679
There was something I couldn't let go of.

263
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,559
But fortunately, I just finished it.

264
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,159
What was it?

265
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,039
You might not remember.

266
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,440
The year the city fell,

267
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,440
you risked your life to get me out of Nanjing.

268
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,559
Before we parted,

269
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,000
you promised me

270
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:33,480
that you would definitely take me back.

271
00:15:37,159 --> 00:15:39,919
I've imagined going home countless times.

272
00:15:41,159 --> 00:15:42,480
I just never thought

273
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,279
But fortunately,

274
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,799
for this last stretch of the journey,

275
00:15:50,759 --> 00:15:52,200
you were the one by my side.

276
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,000
Don't be sad.

277
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:05,120
Back then, when we parted ways,

278
00:16:05,559 --> 00:16:06,279
we both, without planning it,

279
00:16:06,279 --> 00:16:08,080
ended up walking the same red path.

280
00:16:10,279 --> 00:16:11,519
This isn't our fate.

281
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:14,320
It's our own choice.

282
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,240
We chose

283
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,360
to stand on the side of justice and truth.

284
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,279
Yes.

285
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:22,840
What we gave up

286
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:23,840
isn't a sacrifice.

287
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,240
It's not a loss.

288
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,600
Instead, it has gathered into

289
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,559
something more important: spirit and faith.

290
00:16:30,679 --> 00:16:32,080
So, Comrade Qingshuang,

291
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,360
please help me

292
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:37,120
carry this on.

293
00:16:48,159 --> 00:16:50,759
The action team in Nanjing has already been notified.

294
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,440
Director.

295
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,919
I believe

296
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,679
there's still something suspicious about this matter.

297
00:16:55,679 --> 00:16:56,360
What?

298
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,559
It's already come to this,

299
00:16:57,799 --> 00:16:59,039
and you're still pleading for him?

300
00:16:59,200 --> 00:16:59,919
I wouldn't dare.

301
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:01,440
I don't care whether Liang Shuo has a problem or not.

302
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,879
Just bring him back to me first.

303
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,559
I've already given the order

304
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,480
to set up checkpoints along all main roads.

305
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,960
As long as they head toward Nanjing,

306
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,440
they absolutely won't escape.

307
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:32,799
Director Liang

308
00:17:34,279 --> 00:17:35,839
What are you trying to pull here?

309
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I was about to ask the same.

310
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,799
Why is Takagi here?

311
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:43,359
Chief Liang

312
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:45,000
We just ran into each other by chance.

313
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,480
There must be

314
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,759
some kind of misunderstanding here.

315
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:49,319
Let's sit down

316
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:50,480
and talk this through.

317
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,960
Boss, are you alright?

318
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:15,160
Liang Shuo

319
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,880
Are you trying to start a rebellion?

320
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,240
Are you a Communist?

321
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:29,000
I think you two are the real Communists.

322
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:31,119
Take their guns away.

323
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:31,920
Yes, sir.

324
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,519
Chief Liang

325
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,200
Chief Liang, what do you mean by this?

326
00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:36,079
It's a misunderstanding!

327
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:36,759
I...

328
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,480
You'd better behave.

329
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,440
I checked with the confidential office.

330
00:18:40,759 --> 00:18:41,920
Deputy Chief Huang had no idea

331
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,279
that you two were assigned to this mission.

332
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,240
What?

333
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,400
I suspect the Communists

334
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:49,519
are putting on an act here.

335
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,480
How are we Communists now?

336
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,200
Chief Liang

337
00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:53,240
Mazi

338
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:54,559
Old Bai

339
00:18:55,279 --> 00:18:56,599
I'm handing the prisoner over to you.

340
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:58,400
Escort them safely to Nanjing.

341
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,480
If anything goes wrong on the way,

342
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,119
you two will answer to me with your heads.

343
00:19:02,119 --> 00:19:02,880
Yes, yes.

344
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,039
Chief Liang

345
00:19:04,039 --> 00:19:05,400
It's a misunderstanding, Chief Liang!

346
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:17,160
You were waiting for me.

347
00:19:18,359 --> 00:19:19,319
Comrade Qingshuang.

348
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,000
Welcome home.

349
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,079
Comrade Qingshuang.

350
00:19:24,839 --> 00:19:25,839
You must be careful.

351
00:19:26,759 --> 00:19:27,599
You said that now I have

352
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:29,279
completely accepted my identity.

353
00:19:31,079 --> 00:19:32,160
But actually, I haven't.

354
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,680
I still just want to live a good life.

355
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:37,039
The reason I was willing to come see you

356
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,640
whether it's Maple Leaf

357
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:39,640
or you,

358
00:19:40,119 --> 00:19:41,559
is simply because thinking of you

359
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,079
makes me feel familiar and at ease.

360
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,079
I want to stay in Shanghai and keep working.

361
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:48,720
Here,

362
00:19:50,119 --> 00:19:51,359
there are people I care about.

363
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,079
When I left Nanjing back then,

364
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,920
I originally wanted to find you.

365
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,319
But due to a twist of fate,

366
00:20:00,279 --> 00:20:02,000
I almost died at the hands of the Japanese.

367
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,119
I'm very curious.

368
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,279
Losing one's memory—

369
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:09,000
what does it feel like?

370
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:12,160
It's like being in a vast white fog.

371
00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:14,680
You don't know where you came from,

372
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,240
and you can't see where you're going.

373
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:18,559
You know you are yourself,

374
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:22,279
but that's all you know.

375
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,319
Liang Shuo,

376
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,079
no matter how many times you lose your way,

377
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,640
I believe

378
00:20:31,319 --> 00:20:33,279
you will always find the right path.

379
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,559
Don't remember the road you've traveled,

380
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,960
just strive to reach far.

381
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:47,000
Don't remember the road you've traveled,

382
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,759
just strive to reach far.

383
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:03,720
Go.

384
00:21:04,039 --> 00:21:04,720
Sir.

385
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,039
Are we just letting them go like this?

386
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,440
The chief gave instructions.

387
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,440
At this critical moment for the conference,

388
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,799
we can't fall out with the Nanjing side.

389
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:37,480
The operation is canceled.

390
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,279
Withdraw.

391
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:03,160
From this perspective,

392
00:22:03,319 --> 00:22:04,880
this whole incident

393
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,319
really was a series of coincidences.

394
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,799
The whole course of events

395
00:22:12,119 --> 00:22:14,440
is just Liang Shuo's side of the story.

396
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,039
How much of it is actually true

397
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,279
I think

398
00:22:18,599 --> 00:22:20,200
is still questionable.

399
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:24,920
So what really happened?

400
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,240
Song Qian.

401
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,640
You tell us.

402
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,640
To be honest, I'm ashamed.

403
00:22:32,279 --> 00:22:34,839
We did deceive Director Liang at first.

404
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,359
It was only to hide our identities.

405
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,519
We didn't expect him to be so alert.

406
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,319
We

407
00:22:44,599 --> 00:22:47,279
just didn't want to expose the chief.

408
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,039
We also didn't expect

409
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:51,079
that they would actually send people to investigate.

410
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,319
No matter who Liang Shuo is,

411
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,440
in the two years you've been at headquarters,

412
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,119
haven't you learned to be more careful?

413
00:22:58,279 --> 00:22:59,240
Tell me, should I

414
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,839
just have you two executed?

415
00:23:00,839 --> 00:23:03,200
So I don't have to waste my breath explaining to Liang Shuo.

416
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,000
Chief.

417
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:04,880
Chief.

418
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:05,920
Get out.

419
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,079
Yes, sir.

420
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:21,799
What happened today

421
00:23:22,119 --> 00:23:24,759
I will report everything truthfully to Director Mizuno.

422
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,359
I also want an explanation from Mr. Mizuno.

423
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:32,880
Why did Captain Takagi suddenly show up today

424
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,359
without any prior notice?

425
00:23:34,359 --> 00:23:37,160
It almost caused a misunderstanding and a major mistake.

426
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:40,480
Fortunately, Liang Shuo protected the suspect at the critical moment.

427
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,400
If anything had happened to the suspect

428
00:23:43,759 --> 00:23:45,160
then how would you expect me

429
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:48,160
to explain this to the Nanjing government?

430
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,279
Prepare a detailed report

431
00:23:57,559 --> 00:23:59,319
on the minutes of this meeting.

432
00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:02,279
I want to send it to Mizuno.

433
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:03,440
Chief,

434
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:07,480
this is an internal matter for Unit 76.

435
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,319
In terms of authority,

436
00:24:09,799 --> 00:24:11,640
there's no need to send it to Meihuatang.

437
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,519
But Takagi's military police

438
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:16,519
are stationed at the Special Operations Headquarters.

439
00:24:16,759 --> 00:24:17,920
Yet for this operation,

440
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,640
I wasn't informed at all.

441
00:24:20,519 --> 00:24:23,039
Mizuno is disrespecting Chief Ding,

442
00:24:23,559 --> 00:24:24,720
and also disrespecting me.

443
00:24:25,519 --> 00:24:26,839
I'm asking you to report this

444
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:28,200
to remind him

445
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:29,880
that Mizuno's reach

446
00:24:30,119 --> 00:24:31,640
should not extend too far.

447
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,559
Understood.

448
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,319
I'm afraid Mizuno Shingen's reach will only get longer.

449
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,920
We've received a reply from Nanjing.

450
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:42,559
The incident regarding the 3-1 list

451
00:24:43,079 --> 00:24:45,079
is now confirmed beyond doubt.

452
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,200
It seems that between us and Mizuno,

453
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:50,599
there will likely be

454
00:24:50,599 --> 00:24:52,079
another covert struggle.

455
00:24:56,279 --> 00:24:58,039
This concerns the fate of the Nanjing government's rule.

456
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,079
We must also give our utmost effort.

457
00:25:04,319 --> 00:25:05,839
How is it going with Liang Shuo?

458
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,240
Director Liang

459
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,680
has been waiting to request an audience.

460
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,799
He says he wants to apologize in person.

461
00:25:14,039 --> 00:25:15,359
I treated him with suspicion,

462
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,400
yet he acted with integrity.

463
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:18,920
What is there to apologize for?

464
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:21,039
Fortunately, it was just a minor conflict, a small misunderstanding.

465
00:25:21,799 --> 00:25:22,480
Director,

466
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,160
how about this:

467
00:25:24,759 --> 00:25:25,960
issue a notice

468
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,599
that Song and Zhang

469
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:28,960
misinterpreted the higher-ups' intentions

470
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,519
and acted on their own.

471
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,279
Let the committee handle their punishment.

472
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,480
Let's do that, then.

473
00:25:38,759 --> 00:25:39,960
Have Cui Mo

474
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,160
go and reassure Liang Shuo.

475
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,079
Right now, 76 is in urgent need of people.

476
00:25:44,359 --> 00:25:45,440
As the saying goes,

477
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,519
do not use those you distrust,

478
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:48,599
and do not distrust those you use.

479
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:49,680
Yes.

480
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:16,680
When did you get here?

481
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,160
I've been here for a while.

482
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:24,039
You must be under a lot of pressure lately.

483
00:26:27,599 --> 00:26:28,920
How is Liang Shuo?

484
00:26:29,799 --> 00:26:32,000
He has already sent Jiang Feiman to Nanjing.

485
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:36,200
Liang Shuo didn't try to save Jiang Feiman.

486
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,480
That shows that up to now,

487
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,880
he is still trustworthy.

488
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,599
He didn't try to save her,

489
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,519
but that doesn't mean he didn't want to.

490
00:26:50,039 --> 00:26:50,599
Right.

491
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:52,960
Makes sense.

492
00:26:54,039 --> 00:26:55,359
We have to be more cautious.

493
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,440
Keep a close eye on him.

494
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,079
About the list,

495
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,880
there can't be any mistakes.

496
00:27:08,039 --> 00:27:08,759
You knew all along

497
00:27:08,759 --> 00:27:10,599
that Nakayama Kazuo isn't Asai Hisashi, right?

498
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,880
Why did you keep it from me?

499
00:27:15,079 --> 00:27:16,119
Not telling you

500
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,240
was to prevent the information from leaking out early.

501
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,480
Between the Japanese and Wang Jingwei,

502
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:26,440
we've managed to create a rift.

503
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,200
And

504
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,440
we've also successfully dealt with

505
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,839
Jiang Feiman, the Communist.

506
00:27:35,119 --> 00:27:36,039
Shouldn't we

507
00:27:36,039 --> 00:27:36,880
celebrate

508
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,359
with a drink?

509
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:43,240
Does Liang Shuo know about this?

510
00:27:44,359 --> 00:27:45,319
Or

511
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,920
does he not need to know either?

512
00:27:52,839 --> 00:27:54,079
The fewer people who know,

513
00:27:54,279 --> 00:27:55,359
the better.

514
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,880
It seems you two are working together quite well.

515
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:01,559
You can continue cooperating to find the list.

516
00:28:02,759 --> 00:28:03,960
From what I can guess,

517
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:07,079
the Asai Toshikazu 31 list is in Shanghai.

518
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,000
Otherwise,

519
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:09,720
he wouldn't have

520
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,720
used a false identity as Nakayama Kazuo

521
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,119
as a cover.

522
00:28:16,079 --> 00:28:17,880
What exactly is the origin of this list?

523
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,759
Speaking of this list,

524
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:22,359
it has quite a history.

525
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:26,039
I dealt with Asai Toshikazu in the early years.

526
00:28:26,839 --> 00:28:28,359
He is extremely cunning

527
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,759
and hard to control.

528
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,720
Is there any news from Mizuno?

529
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,839
Meihuatang probably hasn't gotten hold of the list yet.

530
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:45,279
Otherwise, after Wang Mutian defected,

531
00:28:46,039 --> 00:28:47,160
there wouldn't have been no reaction.

532
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:49,599
Nishima,

533
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,880
you must trust the teacher.

534
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:57,000
Everything we do is for the party and the country.

535
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,519
This is our last chance.

536
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:01,720
So,

537
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,200
I want you to help me

538
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,400
retrieve something.

539
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:20,680
Don't be sad.

540
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:22,799
Back then, we parted ways.

541
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,000
Yet, without planning it,

542
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,680
we both walked the same red path.

543
00:29:26,079 --> 00:29:27,480
This isn't our fate.

544
00:29:28,599 --> 00:29:30,200
It's our own choice.

545
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:31,839
We chose

546
00:29:31,839 --> 00:29:34,000
to stand on the side of justice and truth.

547
00:29:34,279 --> 00:29:34,920
Yes.

548
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,480
What we gave up

549
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,480
is not a sacrifice,

550
00:29:37,839 --> 00:29:38,920
nor a loss.

551
00:29:40,359 --> 00:29:41,200
Instead, it has gathered into

552
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,200
something more important: spirit and faith.

553
00:29:43,839 --> 00:29:45,200
So, Comrade Qingshuang,

554
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,359
please, for me,

555
00:29:49,119 --> 00:29:50,240
carry it on.

556
00:30:09,079 --> 00:30:10,119
Be careful not to catch a cold.

557
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:14,440
I've contacted Old Tan.

558
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:17,200
It's dangerous right now.

559
00:30:17,559 --> 00:30:19,480
We probably won't be able to reach him for a while.

560
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:21,279
Sister Man...

561
00:30:23,319 --> 00:30:24,759
I didn't protect her well.

562
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:30,279
It's not your fault.

563
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Everyone has their own mission.

564
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:34,759
You can't escape it.

565
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:35,839
Nor can you avoid it.

566
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,079
If fate is truly set,

567
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,039
why do we struggle so hard in this sea of suffering?

568
00:30:46,039 --> 00:30:47,839
We might as well leave it to fate.

569
00:30:52,839 --> 00:30:53,559
Liang Shuo.

570
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,440
I want to continue Sister Man's path.

571
00:30:57,519 --> 00:30:58,440
I want to join the Party.

572
00:30:58,880 --> 00:30:59,720
For her,

573
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:00,599
and for myself,

574
00:31:00,599 --> 00:31:01,799
I want to keep going.

575
00:31:11,559 --> 00:31:13,400
You're already on this path.

576
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:17,039
And I need your help.

577
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:32,640
Both telegrams have arrived.

578
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,119
Good.

579
00:31:43,599 --> 00:31:45,160
What do you think about this?

580
00:31:46,039 --> 00:31:48,519
All the painstaking efforts to build up Shanghai have been destroyed in an instant.

581
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,240
At a time like this,

582
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,559
it's exactly when someone needs to step up and take responsibility.

583
00:31:53,599 --> 00:31:55,200
Just say what you think.

584
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,119
Better to make a mistake

585
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,440
than to let someone slip by.

586
00:32:02,519 --> 00:32:04,680
Do we still have our people in Shanghai?

587
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,680
Mr. Dai, have you forgotten?

588
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,880
Mr. Liu is also in Shanghai overseeing operations right now.

589
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,039
I spoke with him on the phone earlier.

590
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,559
He wasn't affected by this incident.

591
00:32:14,039 --> 00:32:14,839
Good.

592
00:32:15,599 --> 00:32:17,279
Contact Liu Daohong immediately.

593
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:20,240
I have new instructions for him.

594
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,039
Lao Wu

595
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:27,920
Director Dai

596
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,400
Order the Military Intelligence in Shanghai

597
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,880
to suspend all activities

598
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,440
and await new orders.

599
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,039
Very good.

600
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:35,799
Reply immediately.

601
00:32:36,279 --> 00:32:37,440
Xie Jun'an

602
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,440
disobeyed orders and fled, his whereabouts are unknown.

603
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,440
You have already ordered a full-scale manhunt.

604
00:32:41,799 --> 00:32:43,599
If found, shoot on sight.

605
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:44,519
Look at the situation we're in.

606
00:32:44,519 --> 00:32:45,759
You're still making jokes like this?

607
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:46,880
Joking?

608
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:49,279
It's Director Dai who's joking, isn't it?

609
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,759
Do I look like I'm joking?

610
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:54,079
Are you planning to disobey orders?

611
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,400
We've just gotten the first clue about the March 1st list.

612
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,440
Do you want me to give up now?

613
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,519
Aren't I still here?

614
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,640
If you follow orders and go back now,

615
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,319
at least you can silence

616
00:33:05,319 --> 00:33:06,680
those who spread rumors and stir up trouble.

617
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:08,920
Lao Wu

618
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,400
Don't push yourself onto a dead end.

619
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,279
When a general is in the field,

620
00:33:13,759 --> 00:33:15,160
he doesn't always have to obey the king's orders.

621
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,640
Even if the old man gives the order,

622
00:33:18,359 --> 00:33:19,440
I still have to weigh it carefully.

623
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,880
It's taken so much to get to this point.

624
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,720
Now that the Wang puppet regime

625
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,759
and the Japanese

626
00:33:25,759 --> 00:33:26,960
are starting to have conflicts,

627
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,599
this is our only chance.

628
00:33:29,359 --> 00:33:31,680
We must get the list before the Communists do.

629
00:33:31,799 --> 00:33:33,240
Otherwise, it'll be too late.

630
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,240
Lu Xijian

631
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:39,400
has already found the roster for the training camp.

632
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,839
Sometimes I really don't know

633
00:33:48,759 --> 00:33:50,319
if the path I've chosen

634
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:51,519
is right or wrong.

635
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:55,440
As long as I don't let myself regret it,

636
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,200
then it can't be wrong.

637
00:33:58,359 --> 00:34:00,039
I stayed, and I have no regrets.

638
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,240
Gather everyone first.

639
00:34:03,359 --> 00:34:04,920
Now both the Wang puppet regime and the Japanese high command

640
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,680
know about the 3-1 list.

641
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,920
I want to see

642
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:09,719
how long Mizuno Shingen

643
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,039
can keep Asai Juzou.

644
00:34:24,519 --> 00:34:25,320
Chief

645
00:34:26,119 --> 00:34:26,559
Just now

646
00:34:26,559 --> 00:34:29,480
A call came from Secretary Harada of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs

647
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:32,360
Just reply to him as I instructed

648
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,000
Yes

649
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:35,159
I replied

650
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,320
that we are also closely monitoring

651
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:39,320
the matter of Asai Hisashi's escape

652
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,960
No need to pay attention to what they say

653
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,320
Now it's the Ministry of Foreign Affairs calling

654
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,519
Who knows when

655
00:34:45,519 --> 00:34:47,920
it will be the Army Department calling

656
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:51,400
Ever since the Nanjing government lodged a protest with Dong Jing

657
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,079
this matter

658
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:53,679
we can no longer keep it hidden

659
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,840
The news about Asai Hisashi being in Shanghai

660
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,039
Who leaked it?

661
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:00,320
How does the Nanjing side know so many details?

662
00:35:02,199 --> 00:35:04,079
Could it be that the Nanjing side

663
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:06,920
got the information from the captured communists?

664
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:08,559
Impossible

665
00:35:09,639 --> 00:35:11,119
The Military Command's Shanghai station

666
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:13,599
was wiped out long ago

667
00:35:16,719 --> 00:35:17,519
Chief

668
00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:19,920
There's still one more person

669
00:35:22,719 --> 00:35:23,559
Scorpio

670
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,159
I overlooked that

671
00:35:27,559 --> 00:35:30,079
Although the Shanghai station was destroyed

672
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,079
Scorpio has never been caught

673
00:35:35,519 --> 00:35:37,840
Mr. Asai also warned you about this

674
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,960
Are you mocking me?

675
00:35:41,159 --> 00:35:42,679
I wouldn't dare

676
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,079
The higher-ups

677
00:35:49,199 --> 00:35:51,079
may already know about the list.

678
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,800
If

679
00:35:53,239 --> 00:35:55,000
we can't keep it hidden any longer,

680
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,880
Mr. Asai's matter

681
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,639
will have to be settled.

682
00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:02,239
This escort operation

683
00:36:02,679 --> 00:36:04,599
can be considered a great success.

684
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,519
Director Liang

685
00:36:06,679 --> 00:36:09,519
has truly contributed both effort and merit.

686
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:12,639
I will, according to the Special Affairs Committee's request,

687
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:13,960
give Director Liang

688
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:16,039
a special commendation.

689
00:36:16,559 --> 00:36:18,159
This time, with the two colleagues from the General Affairs Department,

690
00:36:18,159 --> 00:36:19,440
there was a small misunderstanding.

691
00:36:20,039 --> 00:36:22,000
I am responsible for not noticing it sooner.

692
00:36:22,119 --> 00:36:23,199
Not only did you not hold me accountable,

693
00:36:23,199 --> 00:36:24,320
you even commended me.

694
00:36:24,719 --> 00:36:25,880
I am truly ashamed.

695
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,400
The person has been delivered.

696
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,159
That is the greatest achievement.

697
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:33,639
The Nanjing side attaches great importance to this prisoner.

698
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,480
They also greatly admire Director Liang's decisiveness.

699
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:36,920
and praise him highly.

700
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,599
When the Peace Conference is held,

701
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,519
with Director Liang present,

702
00:36:41,639 --> 00:36:42,960
the Nanjing government

703
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,559
will feel much more at ease.

704
00:36:45,079 --> 00:36:46,559
It's just my duty.

705
00:36:47,559 --> 00:36:48,760
Alright, have a seat.

706
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:49,599
Please, sit.

707
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,840
The time has indeed come

708
00:37:27,239 --> 00:37:30,360
for Mizuno to meet with me.

709
00:37:31,559 --> 00:37:32,800
Senior Asai,

710
00:37:33,199 --> 00:37:34,840
this place used to be

711
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,639
a naval club.

712
00:37:36,639 --> 00:37:39,239
The environment here is still quite nice.

713
00:37:40,119 --> 00:37:41,199
Mr. Asai,

714
00:37:41,199 --> 00:37:43,079
are you still comfortable staying here?

715
00:37:44,719 --> 00:37:46,559
A gilded cage,

716
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,360
no matter how beautiful,

717
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,239
is still,

718
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,159
after all, a cage.

719
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:59,639
I don't agree with Mr. Asai's view.

720
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,719
I'm not sure if I should say this.

721
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,960
Please, go ahead and speak frankly.

722
00:38:05,079 --> 00:38:08,320
The 3-1 list can no longer be implemented smoothly.

723
00:38:08,639 --> 00:38:10,519
Your secret here in Shanghai

724
00:38:10,639 --> 00:38:12,719
will soon be known by the military.

725
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:16,519
Everyone will come looking for you.

726
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,280
I already

727
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,840
warned you before.

728
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,599
Mizuno, you must not be impatient.

729
00:38:22,719 --> 00:38:26,679
If you hadn't

730
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:31,519
insisted on eliminating the Military Command's Shanghai office back then,

731
00:38:31,679 --> 00:38:33,360
I believe the 3-1 list plan

732
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:35,280
would not have been hindered.

733
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,679
Do you understand?

734
00:38:38,679 --> 00:38:40,199
Our opponents

735
00:38:40,199 --> 00:38:42,039
are not as weak as you think.

736
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,840
Today's meeting

737
00:38:45,079 --> 00:38:47,760
is not just a commendation for Director Liang.

738
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:50,800
It is also a special mobilization meeting

739
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,639
on the eve of the Peace Conference.

740
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,320
Everyone present here

741
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,159
are all people whom I,

742
00:38:57,159 --> 00:38:58,599
Li, trust the most.

743
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:02,239
There have been a lot of rumors at headquarters lately.

744
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,800
We're all in the intelligence business.

745
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:05,960
I'm sure

746
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:08,280
you've all heard some news as well.

747
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:09,960
The information from above

748
00:39:10,199 --> 00:39:11,719
Even if we were braver,

749
00:39:11,719 --> 00:39:13,800
we wouldn't dare to spread or inquire about it recklessly.

750
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,920
The news has already been

751
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,519
confirmed by the Nanjing side.

752
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,119
The previous speculation about the "31 List"

753
00:39:20,119 --> 00:39:21,480
is completely true.

754
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,519
Nanjing suspects

755
00:39:23,719 --> 00:39:26,280
that the creator of the "31 List," Asai Hisashi,

756
00:39:26,719 --> 00:39:29,760
is very likely hiding in Meihua Hall.

757
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:31,159
And this person

758
00:39:31,519 --> 00:39:33,480
is crucial to the new government.

759
00:39:34,199 --> 00:39:35,039
So

760
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:36,840
from now on,

761
00:39:37,159 --> 00:39:40,320
we need to closely monitor Meihua Hall's movements.

762
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:42,719
I know one thing:

763
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:46,199
those with support won't fall.

764
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,800
Let's accept reality.

765
00:39:49,159 --> 00:39:51,599
There's no need for pleasantries anymore.

766
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:53,880
Senior Asai,

767
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,159
you know where the list is hidden, don't you?

768
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,719
I've already said

769
00:40:02,239 --> 00:40:05,280
this plan isn't just mine.

770
00:40:06,639 --> 00:40:09,920
The military leadership is already aware of the list's existence.

771
00:40:10,039 --> 00:40:13,960
They only want to use this list.

772
00:40:14,239 --> 00:40:15,320
Senior Asai,

773
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:16,840
what do you think?

774
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:24,360
I've spent my whole life fighting against fate.

775
00:40:24,519 --> 00:40:25,719
Now that things have come to this,

776
00:40:25,719 --> 00:40:27,679
it might not be a bad thing.

777
00:40:32,039 --> 00:40:33,159
I know all of you

778
00:40:33,559 --> 00:40:35,320
are still not quite used to this

779
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,320
but the higher-ups have their own considerations

780
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:41,000
as the saying goes, go with the flow

781
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,480
and you’ll be halfway to success

782
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:46,039
Although our new government and the Japanese government

783
00:40:46,039 --> 00:40:47,639
have deep cooperation

784
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,559
it is also based on

785
00:40:49,679 --> 00:40:51,599
equality and mutual benefit

786
00:40:52,519 --> 00:40:53,719
On the Nanjing side

787
00:40:53,719 --> 00:40:54,920
they have already started negotiations

788
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:57,800
with the Japanese government regarding the list

789
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:59,440
And we

790
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,119
should also actively cooperate

791
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:02,440
with the new government's actions

792
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:04,400
Remember

793
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,039
everything

794
00:41:06,039 --> 00:41:09,079
must put the new government's interests first

795
00:41:09,679 --> 00:41:10,480
Director

796
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:12,599
What is Mizuno Shingen's attitude

797
00:41:12,599 --> 00:41:13,599
toward this matter

798
00:41:16,679 --> 00:41:17,960
Meihuatang, huh

799
00:41:19,079 --> 00:41:21,199
there will be movement soon

800
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:25,760
Senior Asai,

801
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:28,119
please don't say such discouraging things.

802
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:31,840
I have to make plans for myself.

803
00:41:32,119 --> 00:41:35,199
The Sanichi list is my last bargaining chip.

804
00:41:35,639 --> 00:41:39,039
Because of the power struggles at the top,

805
00:41:39,039 --> 00:41:42,039
I will eventually be sent to a military tribunal.

806
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,440
The Sanichi list

807
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:47,679
is the culmination of my entire espionage career.

808
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:48,920
This is

809
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:53,559
Japan's ultimate tool for controlling Greater East Asia,

810
00:41:54,119 --> 00:41:57,599
not just a military merit award for those people.

811
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,599
Senior Asai,

812
00:42:01,079 --> 00:42:03,400
do you trust me, Mizuno?

813
00:42:05,559 --> 00:42:07,039
Trust

814
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:08,480
for a spy,

815
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,920
is a luxury.

816
00:42:10,239 --> 00:42:11,440
Mizuno,

817
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:14,199
you should understand this better than I do, right?

818
00:42:14,559 --> 00:42:15,599
Senior Asai,

819
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:17,039
the list must not fall into anyone else's hands.

820
00:42:17,039 --> 00:42:18,079
Only if you and I work together

821
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:22,480
can your grand vision be realized.

822
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:24,400
It's time for you to make a choice.
