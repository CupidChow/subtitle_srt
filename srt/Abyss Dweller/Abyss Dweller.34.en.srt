1
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:46,799
I also went to see my friend at the newspaper.

2
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:50,439
He said the military academy that Asai Hisashi graduated from

3
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,719
once held activities in Shanghai

4
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:52,879
specifically for young Japanese expatriates.

5
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:54,359
They organized secret training classes.

6
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:55,840
It was in the area around Siping Road.

7
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:57,760
At that time, in the newspapers in Hongkou,

8
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,079
there were brief notices about enrollment.

9
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,319
Also, this group of young people from the army

10
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,000
were all from prominent families with backgrounds.

11
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,719
Their families were either wealthy or influential.

12
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:07,840
They were the descendants of notable Japanese expatriates.

13
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:10,599
Is it possible to find a list of names?

14
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,039
Impossible.

15
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:15,560
How many years

16
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:17,000
Ten years

17
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,840
Ten years have passed

18
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,879
The young man enrolled

19
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:22,919
This Kobayashi Kiyoshi

20
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,080
should be

21
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,240
around thirty years old

22
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:27,240
Now we

23
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,919
can basically determine a range

24
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,080
Since it's regional enrollment

25
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,479
the range won't be too wide

26
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:34,159
Yes

27
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:34,960
From

28
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,039
the old school site

29
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:38,240
to the Beisichuan Road area

30
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:39,080
are scattered

31
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:41,360
with many Japanese expatriate residences

32
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:42,759
We can focus

33
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,560
our search in this area

34
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:47,000
It's just that

35
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,560
ten years have passed

36
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,360
this Kobayashi Kiyoshi

37
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,319
could have become anyone we can think of

38
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:53,319
anyone

39
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:54,560
But

40
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:56,000
even within this area

41
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,120
for us

42
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,400
it's still too big

43
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,759
Yeah

44
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:01,759
I've already

45
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:02,919
sent out everyone we can mobilize

46
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:04,039
They're all out

47
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:05,120
We need to

48
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,520
search carefully

49
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,599
for Kobayashi Kiyoshi

50
00:03:07,719 --> 00:03:09,240
in any place he might appear

51
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:14,240
Are you really planning

52
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,159
to bring your family here?

53
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:17,919
Of course.

54
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,719
Then let's celebrate, Matsuki.

55
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:24,639
for officially settling down in Shanghai.

56
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:26,319
Let's celebrate Matsuki!

57
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,000
Gentlemen,

58
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,560
you look unfamiliar.

59
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:34,879
Is this your first time here?

60
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,919
Shall I introduce you to someone?

61
00:03:39,879 --> 00:03:41,439
This guest is really impatient.

62
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,800
We have a Japanese friend coming over soon.

63
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,840
So we hope you can find

64
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,240
a girl who often interacts with Japanese people.

65
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:49,960
Yes, of course.

66
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,039
The girls here,

67
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:53,280
like Li Yueru, Chen Xiaoli, and Zhang Wanwan,

68
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,960
are all fluent in Japanese.

69
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,599
Chen Xiaoli.

70
00:03:55,879 --> 00:03:56,680
Let her come.

71
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,199
Xiaoli!

72
00:03:58,639 --> 00:03:59,439
Xiaoli.

73
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,199
Alright, sir.

74
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:04,000
Please come inside.

75
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,039
How are you sure

76
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:08,960
that this Chen Xiaoli knows Kobayashi and Kiyoshi?

77
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:10,280
She's the most expensive on the list.

78
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,520
The madam told me.

79
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,920
Xiaoli is here.

80
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,920
You two are honored guests.

81
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:31,120
Please

82
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,759
I wonder

83
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:36,040
who you two are

84
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,560
and who wants to invite me to dance.

85
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,439
We're not here to dance.

86
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,519
We're here to discuss a business deal.

87
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:44,319
A business deal?

88
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,600
Xiao Li

89
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,560
doesn't know anything about business.

90
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,279
Connections are business.

91
00:04:51,319 --> 00:04:52,720
Miss Xiao Li is very popular right now.

92
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,199
She knows quite a few celebrities.

93
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:56,439
We just want to ask Miss Xiao Li

94
00:04:56,519 --> 00:04:58,319
to help introduce us.

95
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:01,120
So after all that,

96
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,120
you just want me to find someone for you.

97
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,040
May I ask what kind of business

98
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:06,879
you two gentlemen are in?

99
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,160
Sake.

100
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:10,879
Sake?

101
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,800
That's a Japanese industry.

102
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,480
Why would Japanese people drink

103
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,319
sake made by Chinese people?

104
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,600
We have a new brewing technique.

105
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:23,800
But we lack the channels and connections.

106
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:25,079
So

107
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,040
we took the liberty

108
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,439
of coming to ask Miss Chen for help.

109
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,120
Well,

110
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,360
it's hard to say.

111
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,240
As for me,

112
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,839
I'm willing to make the introduction.

113
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,279
But I don't know if they'll be willing.

114
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,759
As long as Miss Chen is willing to help,

115
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,800
whether it works out or not,

116
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:46,319
we'll always appreciate your kindness.

117
00:05:58,439 --> 00:05:59,800
Let me think about it.

118
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:14,800
We found out about Kobayashi Heqing.

119
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,000
He was in the sake business seven years ago.

120
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,560
How can you be sure that this Xiaoli

121
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,360
will definitely go to Kobayashi Heqing?

122
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,600
I'm not sure.

123
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,720
But we can give it a try.

124
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,079
Maybe we can follow the clues and find something.

125
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:30,120
That's true.

126
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,759
People in the sake business

127
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,240
naturally know each other.

128
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:34,680
Maybe they

129
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:07,160
Miss Chen is here.

130
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,879
Is Mr. Matsumoto at home?

131
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:11,759
He is at home. Please come in.

132
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,759
I'll have someone keep watch first.

133
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:21,759
I'm going in.

134
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:22,519
Okay.

135
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:24,480
I'll coordinate with your actions when the time is right.

136
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:39,439
Is Mr. Matsumoto at home?

137
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:47,040
What brings you here?

138
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,160
What wind blew you in?

139
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,600
How long has it been since we last met?

140
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,759
I just missed you, that's all.

141
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,000
So,

142
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,480
I decided to come over myself.

143
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,439
Really?

144
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,480
Then,

145
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,879
I have to make it up to you.

146
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,600
Actually, the reason I came this time

147
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,319
is that I have some business to discuss with you.

148
00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:05,399
What is it?

149
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,439
Come in and let's talk.

150
00:08:08,439 --> 00:08:09,560
What exactly is it?

151
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,279
What is it?

152
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:13,439
I was wondering if your sake business

153
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:14,720
is still running.

154
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,720
Are you interested in partnering with others?

155
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:21,079
Did someone ask you about me?

156
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:23,120
No.

157
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,279
It's just that two men approached me.

158
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,639
They said they wanted to work with you.

159
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:29,680
They want to find channels for their sake business.

160
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:31,720
Miss Chen,

161
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,159
You should stay out of things like this.

162
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:39,639
Some things aren't as simple as you think.

163
00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:40,440
Do you understand?

164
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,000
Kobayashi Kazukiyo

165
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:50,559
You should know

166
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:52,519
why I came here.

167
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,080
I don't understand Chinese.

168
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,759
Don't pretend with me.

169
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,320
Your whereabouts were revealed by Asai Hisashi himself.

170
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,360
Playing dumb won't work with me.

171
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:07,120
I really don't know what you're talking about.

172
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:12,759
Fine.

173
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,200
Since you won't talk,

174
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:16,360
there's no point in keeping you.

175
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:19,639
I've heard about that list.

176
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:23,000
That was my teacher's life's work.

177
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,120
But I really don't know where it is.

178
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,799
W-wait, wait.

179
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:31,519
I'll cooperate, cooperate!

180
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:32,320
Cooperate.

181
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,480
Put down the gun.

182
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,039
We found them.

183
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:40,679
Hurry, go!

184
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,440
Someone come quickly! There are anti-Japanese elements here!

185
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,080
You go first.

186
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:43,759
I'll cover you.

187
00:09:50,919 --> 00:09:51,840
Hurry, hurry!

188
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:05,480
Get in the car, quick!

189
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,960
You look a bit familiar to me.

190
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:09,840
Let's talk in the car.

191
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,919
If we don't leave now, it'll be too late.

192
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:11,600
Hurry!

193
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,039
Go, now!

194
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:29,919
Who are you, really?

195
00:10:31,879 --> 00:10:32,960
You don't recognize me?

196
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,840
Is that it?

197
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:36,399
Because of the head injury?

198
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,320
After you escaped from Meihua Hall,

199
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,879
what exactly happened?

200
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:43,600
Our people

201
00:10:43,879 --> 00:10:45,120
have been looking for you all along.

202
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,720
I was rescued by someone.

203
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:53,679
Who are they?

204
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:55,360
What did they say to you?

205
00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:01,679
Why are you asking this?

206
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:04,960
I just want to know

207
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:06,399
who saved you.

208
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:09,279
But no matter who saved you,

209
00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:11,480
you are still one of us in the Military Bureau.

210
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,639
Your code name

211
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:13,559
is Shadow.

212
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,919
Your mentor

213
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,399
was named Xie Jun'an.

214
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:17,360
But he

215
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:20,039
has already died in the line of duty.

216
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,519
Tian

217
00:11:28,759 --> 00:11:29,759
Xie

218
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:56,879
Go.

219
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,200
Move.

220
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,039
Take him down first.

221
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:05,480
Make sure to get him to talk tonight.

222
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,159
Yes.

223
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,080
Let's go.

224
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,120
Come on, move.

225
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:15,519
Liang Shuo.

226
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,120
Do you still remember this place?

227
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,279
Does it look familiar?

228
00:12:21,559 --> 00:12:22,960
I think I remember this place.

229
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,679
Your teacher and I were here

230
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:28,159
making countless action plans.

231
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,960
You’ve been here too.

232
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:32,879
But now,

233
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,200
everything has changed.

234
00:12:36,039 --> 00:12:37,240
How did he die?

235
00:12:38,919 --> 00:12:40,080
For that list,

236
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:42,440
you killed Asai Shou.

237
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,919
He himself

238
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,120
also died because of it.

239
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,720
You were his favorite

240
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,879
and most trusted student.

241
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:54,240
Before he died,

242
00:12:54,679 --> 00:12:56,039
he told you

243
00:12:56,519 --> 00:12:58,559
to make sure you get that list.

244
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,200
Are you

245
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,639
being used by people with ulterior motives?

246
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,320
They know something went wrong here with you,

247
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:11,440
and they want to profit from it.

248
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,200
Yes.

249
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,120
Is that so?

250
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,399
Xie Jun'an.

251
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,799
A founding member of the Fuxing Society.

252
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,519
An upright and principled leader of the agents.

253
00:13:23,879 --> 00:13:26,519
The founder of the Military Command Training Camp.

254
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,399
But do you know?

255
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,320
His name

256
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,879
has long been on this list.

257
00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:35,320
He is a traitor.

258
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:36,919
Who?

259
00:13:38,039 --> 00:13:38,840
Scorpio.

260
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,840
Who told you that?

261
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:43,919
Is it because of your head injury

262
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:44,879
that you remembered wrong?

263
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,919
Did I remember wrong?

264
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,000
Yes.

265
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:51,840
He is your teacher.

266
00:13:52,279 --> 00:13:53,759
Besides, we've worked together for years.

267
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,240
How could he possibly be a traitor?

268
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:03,399
Liang Shuo.

269
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,960
Do you remember Nian Ci?

270
00:14:07,879 --> 00:14:08,879
Xie Nian Ci.

271
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,639
I vaguely remember.

272
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:16,559
A girl who was especially important to me.

273
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,960
She is Scorpio's biological niece.

274
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:21,639
So

275
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,320
you and us,

276
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:24,120
and also

277
00:14:24,279 --> 00:14:25,720
Xie Nian Ci and Scorpio,

278
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:27,759
we are the real family.

279
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:36,399
Liang Shuo

280
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,720
Sit down and take a rest first.

281
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,080
These past few days

282
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,679
too many things have happened.

283
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,799
It's made us a bit

284
00:14:46,279 --> 00:14:47,600
at a loss.

285
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:49,320
Come on,

286
00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:52,320
have a drink.

287
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,399
Calm your nerves.

288
00:14:55,039 --> 00:14:55,840
Take it easy.

289
00:15:16,919 --> 00:15:17,679
Liang Shuo,

290
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:20,080
now

291
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:23,159
we can be honest with each other.

292
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:25,200
When all of this is over,

293
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:27,000
where do you plan to go?

294
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:30,080
Unless the war ends,

295
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:33,440
nothing will really stop.

296
00:15:34,519 --> 00:15:35,639
In the chaos of war,

297
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:37,279
we're like drifting duckweed.

298
00:15:38,039 --> 00:15:39,200
But no matter what,

299
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,320
everyone has a plan.

300
00:15:42,039 --> 00:15:42,840
For example,

301
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:45,159
I'll go to Chongqing,

302
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:46,919
while some people

303
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:49,279
will go to Yan'an.

304
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,519
Didn't you say

305
00:15:54,279 --> 00:15:55,960
we're the real family?

306
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,080
That's right.

307
00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:00,559
So you

308
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:02,440
just rest here for now.

309
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:05,080
When I get the list,

310
00:16:05,559 --> 00:16:06,679
I'll come find you.

311
00:16:09,799 --> 00:16:10,840
There's something wrong with this wine.

312
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:19,159
You drugged it.

313
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,399
Sorry.

314
00:16:34,919 --> 00:16:36,159
I promised Lao Wu.

315
00:16:37,159 --> 00:16:38,720
I absolutely can't let this list

316
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,519
fall into anyone else's hands.

317
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:43,879
Mr. Liu.

318
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,120
We've gotten the information.

319
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:48,039
The list is hidden in Citibank.

320
00:16:48,519 --> 00:16:49,480
Citibank.

321
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:53,000
What about him?

322
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,279
Tie him up.

323
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:56,080
Keep an eye on him.

324
00:16:56,679 --> 00:16:58,159
Once everything is settled,

325
00:16:58,399 --> 00:16:59,720
escort him back to Chongqing.

326
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:00,879
and wait for further instructions.

327
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,320
Yes.

328
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,440
I'll immediately contact the Military Command's Hangzhou office.

329
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,240
Have their people

330
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,880
meet us at Ruanjia Bridge tomorrow.

331
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,720
We'll use a blue flag as the signal.

332
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,839
After we get the list from Citibank,

333
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:14,279
quickly

334
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,519
retreat along the Suzhou River.

335
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,319
Yes.

336
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,000
Liang Shuo.

337
00:18:54,839 --> 00:18:55,440
Come in.

338
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:00,640
How is it?

339
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,160
Liu Daohong has kidnapped Xiaolin and Qing.

340
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,920
The list is at the Citibank on Siming Road.

341
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,319
Qingshuang will head there in advance.

342
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,519
We need to make preparations early as well.

343
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:40,519
What's wrong?

344
00:19:40,519 --> 00:19:41,200
Sir.

345
00:19:41,279 --> 00:19:42,680
The Japanese military police patrolling here

346
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:44,119
are much more frequent than usual.

347
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,279
Drive slowly.

348
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:48,960
Don't make any sudden moves.

349
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:09,000
Be careful.

350
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:10,000
Try to

351
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:11,440
avoid drawing attention.

352
00:20:12,039 --> 00:20:13,079
You, come here and watch him.

353
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:13,880
Yes.

354
00:20:29,319 --> 00:20:30,119
Sir, please take this.

355
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:30,799
Take care.

356
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,480
Gentlemen,

357
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,000
how may I assist you?

358
00:20:51,799 --> 00:20:53,599
This is the key to safe deposit box 277.

359
00:20:53,599 --> 00:20:54,680
We need to retrieve something.

360
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,480
Name?

361
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,079
Li Shousheng.

362
00:21:05,079 --> 00:21:06,119
The name matches.

363
00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:07,720
But for VIP clients' items,

364
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,240
I need to inform our manager.

365
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:12,200
Is that really necessary?

366
00:21:16,119 --> 00:21:17,400
If the name matches, there shouldn't be a problem.

367
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,200
Keep your voice down.

368
00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:20,079
Yes.

369
00:21:24,599 --> 00:21:25,400
Go over there.

370
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:27,359
Go over there.

371
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,000
The manager has another key.

372
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,720
Yours alone can't open it.

373
00:21:34,279 --> 00:21:35,480
Take us to the manager's office.

374
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,359
Yes.

375
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:37,480
This way, please.

376
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:39,160
Let's go.

377
00:21:51,119 --> 00:21:51,839
Excuse me.

378
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,400
We're in a bit of a hurry.

379
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,799
Can you simplify the procedures for me?

380
00:21:56,039 --> 00:21:57,960
Take the key to safe deposit box 277.

381
00:21:58,279 --> 00:21:59,400
Take us to the vault.

382
00:21:59,799 --> 00:22:01,519
Alright, alright.

383
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:06,599
Let's go.

384
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,160
Go.

385
00:22:09,759 --> 00:22:10,400
Wait a moment.

386
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:13,359
Don't be nervous.

387
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,000
Relax.

388
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:17,960
Move.

389
00:22:29,359 --> 00:22:31,880
Is there any problem with the Citibank operation?

390
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,440
Is the net set up?

391
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:37,480
Thanks to Senior Asai's guidance.

392
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,680
We're ready and waiting.

393
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,079
This time,

394
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:42,920
No mistakes allowed.

395
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:56,960
Somebody, help!

396
00:23:04,039 --> 00:23:06,160
Get out of the car! Get out!

397
00:23:32,359 --> 00:23:33,599
Move! Move!

398
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,119
Don't block the way.

399
00:23:35,559 --> 00:23:36,359
Move aside.

400
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:37,960
Out of the way.

401
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,480
Don't move.

402
00:23:40,039 --> 00:23:40,839
Shut up.

403
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,119
Sir.

404
00:23:55,359 --> 00:23:56,279
This is the place.

405
00:23:56,759 --> 00:23:57,880
The key to the safe deposit box.

406
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,640
The bank and the individual each hold a key.

407
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,759
Both keys are needed to open it.

408
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:10,279
Alright, alright.

409
00:24:18,119 --> 00:24:18,920
Turn around.

410
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,079
Nobody move.

411
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:29,160
Mr. Liu.

412
00:25:29,759 --> 00:25:30,960
The Japanese are already here.

413
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,920
If we don't leave now, it'll be too late.

414
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,559
Give me the list.

415
00:25:37,079 --> 00:25:38,599
Are you really from Yan'an?

416
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,240
Xie Nianci.

417
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,279
You took her away too, didn't you?

418
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,480
If you shoot and kill me now,

419
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,119
the list will be yours.

420
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,240
If I really wanted to kill you,

421
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,200
when I took the list just now,

422
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,519
you would already be dead.

423
00:25:55,759 --> 00:25:56,640
Give me the list.

424
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:58,119
You can go.

425
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,680
Then let's see

426
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,440
who can get out of here safely.

427
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:12,640
Hurry, go!

428
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,440
This place is completely surrounded by the Japanese.

429
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,440
What should we do?

430
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,880
Let's take another route.

431
00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:28,279
Go.

432
00:26:38,759 --> 00:26:40,359
You guys go up and take a look.

433
00:26:42,279 --> 00:26:43,160
This way.

434
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:23,920
There's a side door over there.

435
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,559
We'll leave through there in a moment.

436
00:27:25,559 --> 00:27:26,440
I'll cover you.

437
00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:28,480
Liang Shuo.

438
00:27:29,079 --> 00:27:29,920
I'm sorry.

439
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,240
What's the point of saying that now?

440
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,920
If we get caught by the Japanese,

441
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,240
we'll lose everything.

442
00:27:59,319 --> 00:28:00,240
Bomb!

443
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:30,839
Hurry, go!

444
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,640
What did they take from the safe?

445
00:28:40,839 --> 00:28:42,480
There was a thick document.

446
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,359
There were also many handwritten letters inside.

447
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:45,680
And some other things,

448
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,160
like files and records.

449
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:48,400
The 3-1 list.

450
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,319
Take it away.

451
00:28:49,319 --> 00:28:49,799
Yes.

452
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:50,559
Let's go.

453
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:52,160
Report to Director Mizuno immediately.

454
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,720
The rest of you, surround the bank with me.

455
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:07,359
Where's the list?

456
00:29:08,039 --> 00:29:09,160
Liu Daohong has it.

457
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,079
Downstairs is already blocked off.

458
00:29:11,079 --> 00:29:12,400
Find a way to get out from here.

459
00:29:24,839 --> 00:29:25,799
Comrade Qingshuang.

460
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,440
I'll buy you some time.

461
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:28,279
Go!

462
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,880
Hold them off!

463
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:32,640
Yes!

464
00:29:33,359 --> 00:29:34,119
Go!

465
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:56,200
Go!

466
00:30:31,799 --> 00:30:32,519
Let's go.

467
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:01,720
Go up.

468
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:02,960
Yes, sir.

469
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:35,759
Keep searching.

470
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,119
Thank you for saving my life.

471
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,079
Help him up.

472
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,119
I'm deeply grateful.

473
00:32:01,799 --> 00:32:02,799
People from the Military Bureau.

474
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:04,920
Why were you caught so easily?

475
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:06,000
This...

476
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,519
I'm not sure.

477
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:08,480
They took the list.

478
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,039
But you were with them.

479
00:32:10,039 --> 00:32:11,519
Do you know

480
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,920
about the news of Asai Hisashi's death?

481
00:32:15,119 --> 00:32:17,279
Nothing escapes the chief's eyes.

482
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:18,680
Please forgive me.

483
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:22,160
I was indeed following Professor Asai's orders.

484
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,440
Please let me go.

485
00:32:24,079 --> 00:32:24,720
Alright.

486
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,880
I just want to know one thing.

487
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:26,519
Yes.

488
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,039
Is there only one copy of the 3-1 list?

489
00:32:29,079 --> 00:32:30,839
There's only one.

490
00:32:30,839 --> 00:32:32,279
It can't be copied.

491
00:32:32,279 --> 00:32:33,200
It's the only copy.

492
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:36,119
I'm not interested in those anti-Japanese elements.

493
00:32:36,119 --> 00:32:36,799
Not interested.

494
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:40,200
Why did this list

495
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,559
end up in their hands so easily?

496
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:43,759
Th-this...

497
00:32:43,759 --> 00:32:44,559
Speak quickly.

498
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:45,920
Th-this...

499
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,119
This...

500
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:49,799
Take him away.

501
00:32:49,799 --> 00:32:50,559
Chief.

502
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:51,880
Please let me explain.

503
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,519
Please listen to me.

504
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:54,279
Chief.

505
00:32:54,279 --> 00:32:56,599
Give me a chance.

506
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:58,799
Chief.

507
00:32:59,319 --> 00:33:00,559
A traitor.

508
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:01,640
What fate should he face?

509
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,160
Sir.

510
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:03,839
Understood.

511
00:33:04,279 --> 00:33:05,480
Where is Takagi now?

512
00:33:06,119 --> 00:33:07,240
Takagi has already caught up with them.

513
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:09,440
They're fleeing toward the Suzhou River.

514
00:33:10,599 --> 00:33:12,039
Then set up there.

515
00:33:12,039 --> 00:33:12,839
Set an ambush.

516
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,960
The Third Military Police Station is nearby.

517
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,440
I'll go get reinforcements right away.

518
00:33:18,519 --> 00:33:19,960
Make sure none of them escape.

519
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:22,559
Hongkou District is our territory.

520
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,720
If they get away here,

521
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,839
we might as well retire.

522
00:33:26,079 --> 00:33:27,119
Yes, I understand what's at stake.

523
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,240
Where's Old Chen?

524
00:33:33,599 --> 00:33:34,400
He sacrificed himself.

525
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:37,839
You all need to go, quickly.

526
00:33:38,119 --> 00:33:40,440
The Suzhou River is just two streets away.

527
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,640
There are boats by the riverbank.

528
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,839
If it benefits the country,

529
00:33:43,839 --> 00:33:45,000
I will give my life for it.

530
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,599
Your party's spirit

531
00:33:46,599 --> 00:33:47,640
is truly admirable.

532
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,039
Everything that happened in the past

533
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:51,279
I am here

534
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:52,400
to say I'm sorry.

535
00:33:53,119 --> 00:33:53,920
Say no more.

536
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,480
Hurry, go!

537
00:33:55,359 --> 00:33:56,279
Let's leave right away.

538
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:00,640
Where is he?

539
00:34:01,759 --> 00:34:02,440
Where is he?

540
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,759
What are you looking for, Mr. Liu?

541
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,160
Liang Shuo.

542
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,839
This is the meeting place we agreed on.

543
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:09,519
It seems that we have already

544
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,000
been abandoned as pawns.

545
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:12,440
Liang Shuo.

546
00:34:12,519 --> 00:34:14,079
You must survive and break out.

547
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:14,840
Otherwise,

548
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:15,920
everyone's death

549
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,199
will be meaningless.

550
00:34:18,039 --> 00:34:19,440
We all have to survive.

551
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,360
All the lists

552
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:27,840
are in here.

553
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:29,760
We risked our lives for this.

554
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:30,599
Take it.

555
00:34:33,039 --> 00:34:34,079
There's also a batch of explosives

556
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:35,960
hidden at the dye factory on Yuyuan Road.

557
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:36,719
Remember.

558
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,039
Got it.

559
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:38,960
Liang Shuo.

560
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,480
Give me a grenade.

561
00:34:44,599 --> 00:34:45,480
That's the last one.

562
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,320
What are you going to do?

563
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:49,800
We can't get away if we go together.

564
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:51,039
We split up.

565
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:53,440
Take care.

566
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,119
You go this way.

567
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:04,559
Papers.

568
00:35:05,239 --> 00:35:06,039
It's fine.

569
00:35:06,679 --> 00:35:07,400
Next.

570
00:35:07,719 --> 00:35:08,519
Papers.

571
00:35:09,159 --> 00:35:09,800
Go.

572
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:11,679
Next, come forward.

573
00:35:12,599 --> 00:35:13,599
Show your papers.

574
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:22,800
Stop.

575
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,119
Stop.

576
00:35:26,599 --> 00:35:27,199
After them!

577
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:16,599
You have nowhere left to run.

578
00:36:19,039 --> 00:36:20,960
So stop wasting everyone's time.

579
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,199
Mizuno.

580
00:36:25,159 --> 00:36:26,719
How about we make a deal?

581
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,519
You want the list, don't you?

582
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,400
In this bag of mine,

583
00:36:33,159 --> 00:36:35,119
is the list you want.

584
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:36,880
Let me go,

585
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,239
and we can talk about anything.

586
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:39,800
Otherwise,

587
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,239
I'll take this list

588
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,320
with me to the grave.

589
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,400
Throw the bag over.

590
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,480
And I'll let you go.

591
00:36:58,599 --> 00:36:59,320
How do I know

592
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,840
the list in your bag is real?

593
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,480
Then do you dare to take a gamble?

594
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,840
Do you know what I admire about you?

595
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,159
I admire your stupidity.

596
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,679
Like moths drawn endlessly to a flame,

597
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,840
one after another.

598
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,039
One after another.

599
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,320
I like that phrase.

600
00:37:31,679 --> 00:37:32,679
One day,

601
00:37:33,519 --> 00:37:35,239
we will drive you invaders

602
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,400
out of China.

603
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,400
Give me the gun.

604
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:14,760
Chief.

605
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,840
You didn't expect that, did you?

606
00:38:26,039 --> 00:38:27,920
The list is now in my hands.

607
00:38:33,199 --> 00:38:33,719
Chief.

608
00:38:33,719 --> 00:38:34,840
In this operation,

609
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:35,840
we killed eleven enemies in total.

610
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,000
We lost ten of our own.

611
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:37,880
Six were seriously wounded.

612
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,039
Fourteen people sustained minor injuries.

613
00:38:39,039 --> 00:38:40,760
One car was destroyed.

614
00:38:44,559 --> 00:38:45,920
For us,

615
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,599
as long as we get the list,

616
00:38:47,719 --> 00:38:49,599
any price is worth it.

617
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:51,039
However,

618
00:38:51,039 --> 00:38:52,559
not capturing Liang Shuo

619
00:38:52,559 --> 00:38:54,280
is still unsettling.

620
00:38:55,079 --> 00:38:58,159
The Communists are helping him.

621
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,800
He is most likely a Communist as well.

622
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,360
Even if he escapes,

623
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,599
he still can't do anything.

624
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,679
We absolutely cannot let him get away.

625
00:39:08,239 --> 00:39:09,679
How does this list work?

626
00:39:09,679 --> 00:39:11,079
I want him to witness it with his own eyes.

627
00:39:11,239 --> 00:39:13,000
Tell your uncle

628
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,159
that our shared wish has been fulfilled.

629
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:15,920
Understood.

630
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,639
Congratulations to the Director on this great achievement.

631
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:19,559
Takagi,

632
00:39:20,199 --> 00:39:22,000
you must capture Liang Shuo.

633
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,440
We can mobilize Unit 76.

634
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:27,800
Because they know Liang Shuo best.

635
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,320
If we let them join the operation,

636
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,079
Liang Shuo will have no way to escape.

637
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:33,800
At your command.

638
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,639
Team One, follow me.

639
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:41,599
Captain Takagi

640
00:40:42,199 --> 00:40:43,159
The way you're acting

641
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,800
isn't it a bit excessive?

642
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,320
Excessive?

643
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:47,719
Director Li

644
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,360
Please tell me,

645
00:40:49,719 --> 00:40:52,079
is there anything more outrageous than the head of the Operations Department at the Special Agent Headquarters

646
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:54,199
and the Deputy Director of the Special Investigation Division of the Special Agent Committee

647
00:40:54,199 --> 00:40:55,559
being an anti-Japanese element?

648
00:40:55,559 --> 00:40:56,960
Is there anything more outrageous than that?

649
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,599
The inquiry from Chief Mizuno

650
00:40:58,599 --> 00:40:59,880
I also just received it.

651
00:41:00,039 --> 00:41:01,079
Where is the interrogation record?

652
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,079
Where is the evidence?

653
00:41:02,239 --> 00:41:03,800
Lu Xijian was also one of our people,

654
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,760
yet he was executed without our knowledge.

655
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:06,960
He was just executed.

656
00:41:07,079 --> 00:41:09,000
Now you're asking about Liang Shuo,

657
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,840
and it's Chief Mizuno who convicted him.

658
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,519
You expect me, without knowing anything,

659
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:14,760
to give you an answer?

660
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:16,960
Give the documents to the Director.

661
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:33,519
Liang Shuo is a member of the underground party.

662
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:34,639
Captain Takagi,

663
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,920
are you trying

664
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:38,519
to ask for our help?

665
00:41:41,079 --> 00:41:41,840
Director Li,

666
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,320
let me remind you,

667
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,239
cooperating with the Military Police

668
00:41:45,239 --> 00:41:46,519
is the headquarters' duty.

669
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,280
We lost track of the target around the Suzhou River area.

670
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:51,440
Where would Liang Shuo go?

671
00:41:51,639 --> 00:41:53,599
I believe those who are with him day and night

672
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:55,320
should know better than we do.

673
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:56,639
Also,

674
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:57,840
Director, please

675
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:58,679
form a

676
00:41:58,679 --> 00:42:00,079
temporary special operations team as soon as possible.

677
00:42:00,599 --> 00:42:02,280
This is a matter of urgency.
