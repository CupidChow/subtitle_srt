1
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,310
What?

2
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:52,040
Can't you hear what I'm saying?

3
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,560
Bro.

4
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:05,430
What's going on?

5
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,000
You saw what happened.

6
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,910
Don't I have any dignity?

7
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,280
Someone's following us.

8
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:24,400
Stick close to me.

9
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:30,360
Let's go, bro.

10
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,080
Director Cui.

11
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,470
Where are we going?

12
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:40,680
What did you just call me?

13
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:49,360
Brother Cui, you really have no sense of humor.

14
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,190
You brat.

15
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:52,560
Of course, we're heading back to headquarters.

16
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:53,910
The director is still waiting for you.

17
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:55,590
What's wrong with you?

18
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,750
Ever since I saw you just now,

19
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,430
you've been out of it.

20
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,280
Don't be so nervous.

21
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,280
The director isn't going to eat you.

22
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,360
Come on, let's talk in the car.

23
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,680
Boss.

24
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,520
People from No. 76 have come to pick up Liang.

25
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:17,520
I saw it.

26
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,960
We finally waited until he was alone.

27
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,800
And we're just letting it go like this?

28
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,080
There will be plenty of opportunities in the future.

29
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:24,840
The grudge for Master Jiu

30
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,470
will be avenged sooner or later.

31
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,960
Brothers,

32
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:28,910
let's go.

33
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,030
Retreat.

34
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:34,280
Where are they?

35
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,120
That's strange.

36
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:42,560
How can those two girls run so fast?

37
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:44,150
Brother Yan,

38
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:45,280
what should we do?

39
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,680
What do we do?

40
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:47,910
Look for them!

41
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,520
Otherwise, how will we explain to the boss?

42
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,150
Hurry!

43
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:51,400
Let's go!

44
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:07,560
Who are you?

45
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,360
Why are you with him?

46
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:10,710
What about you?

47
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,870
Who are you?

48
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:13,470
They call him Liang Shuo.

49
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:15,080
What is his real identity?

50
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,360
Is he really from No. 76?

51
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:20,720
He didn't tell you?

52
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,600
You don't know?

53
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,070
I'm not that close to him.

54
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:26,800
But he actually...

55
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,480
What exactly is your relationship with him?

56
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:32,800
You're pretty calm about this.

57
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,430
Don't you think

58
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:37,070
you should tell me something?

59
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,120
During this time,

60
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:43,870
you've been looking for me.

61
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:48,000
The Japanese said you died at Yulong Mountain.

62
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:50,000
You fell off a cliff, and your body was never found.

63
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,000
Your office

64
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:53,240
The director is about to be removed.

65
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,000
He's an old friend I haven't seen in years.

66
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:04,240
It's just that

67
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:06,190
I didn't expect

68
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:07,830
he actually doesn't remember me.

69
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:09,630
He had a head injury.

70
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,430
Maybe it

71
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:13,040
affected his memory.

72
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:14,870
A head injury...

73
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:15,870
Yes.

74
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,680
I didn't expect to come back alive either.

75
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:22,750
What exactly happened?

76
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:28,190
Agents are still nearby.

77
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:29,000
Let's go quickly.

78
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:30,800
At the end of this alley is the main road.

79
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:32,120
Let's part ways here.

80
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:33,270
Thank you.

81
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:34,310
Miss Jiang.

82
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:36,800
Helping others is helping yourself.

83
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:37,920
No need to thank me.

84
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,360
Team Leader

85
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,600
Team Leader

86
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,560
Director Cui caught him.

87
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,190
Cui Mo got lucky.

88
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,630
It's not the assassin.

89
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:58,480
It's not the assassin.

90
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,040
Yes.

91
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,000
What is it?

92
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:01,310
It's Director Liang.

93
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:04,830
Liang Shuo.

94
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:05,680
Yes.

95
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:10,270
Did you see clearly?

96
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:11,430
Wasn't he dead?

97
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,070
The guys were shocked too.

98
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:14,870
But they saw it clearly.

99
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,870
It really was Director Liang.

100
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:17,240
Where is he?

101
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:18,360
He's with Director Cui.

102
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,160
Let's go.

103
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:21,270
Get ahead of them.

104
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:21,920
Yes.

105
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:24,950
Alright, I got it.

106
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,560
Sir.

107
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,310
Interesting.

108
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:47,600
A rat just escaped from the Yan residence.

109
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:49,390
And nearby appeared

110
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:53,310
someone who was supposed to have died at Yulong Mountain.

111
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:55,120
Who?

112
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,630
Liang Shuo.

113
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,560
He's still alive.

114
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,870
What about the assassin?

115
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:02,360
What's going on?

116
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,160
If we don't go back now,

117
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,950
we'll miss the show.

118
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,680
Number 76.

119
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:19,830
Director.

120
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:22,070
Is this my real identity?

121
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:23,870
Liang Shuo.

122
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:26,750
You must quickly remember who you are.

123
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:37,920
From now on, this will be your home.

124
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,750
Starting today

125
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:52,920
you officially graduate from here.

126
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:55,510
It also means that from today on

127
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,720
you can officially walk in the sunlight.

128
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,240
You have an identity and a name.

129
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:02,310
Go to work.

130
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,510
Go live your life.

131
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:06,120
Who are you?

132
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,360
Why are you following me?

133
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:09,720
It really is you.

134
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:12,190
You know who I am.

135
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,390
Tell me.

136
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:15,800
Go.

137
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:16,870
Tell the director.

138
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:18,480
Director Liang is still alive.

139
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,630
He's in Shanghai.

140
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:20,430
Yes.

141
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,480
Brother Liang.

142
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:23,920
What's wrong with you?

143
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:26,680
I'm fine.

144
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:29,120
I'm back.

145
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,550
This person doesn't have strong ill will toward me.

146
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,840
He was my friend before.

147
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,910
Or is it just for show?

148
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,840
The matter of Yulong Mountain.

149
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,670
Can I confide in him?

150
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,120
Why do I have so many secrets?

151
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,120
I absolutely can't say the wrong thing.

152
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:50,870
Even half a wrong sentence

153
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,790
would mean falling into an abyss.

154
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,080
All I can do now

155
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,240
is play my part well.

156
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,120
Only then can I survive

157
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,120
in this jungle full of thorns.

158
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:04,120
Before returning to No. 76,

159
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,550
I must gather as much information as possible.

160
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,670
This Cui Mo

161
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,670
might be my last chance.

162
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,390
Sister-in-law

163
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:20,360
Are you okay?

164
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:23,910
This isn't the time for small talk.

165
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,270
She has cried for you so many times.

166
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:30,240
If she knew you were safe,

167
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,120
she would be so happy.

168
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,270
I didn't expect to come back alive either.

169
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,600
What exactly happened?

170
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,960
I know you barely survived this time.

171
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,360
You must be upset.

172
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,720
But no matter what happens,

173
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:50,550
you can always talk to me.

174
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:55,360
It's hard to explain.

175
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,910
So many days have passed since it happened.

176
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:00,790
Aren't you all

177
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,750
supposed to have your own conclusion by now?

178
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:05,550
The preliminary investigation from the Japanese

179
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,200
is that it was an attack by the Military Bureau of Investigation and Statistics.

180
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:08,270
On the Manchukuo side,

181
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:11,080
they caught two anti-Japanese agents disguised as hunters.

182
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,320
But they refused to reveal any information.

183
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:14,750
They have already been executed by the Japanese.

184
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:18,670
The culprit must have been here.

185
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:20,550
Seal off the train station immediately.

186
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:22,840
Then notify Director Hirata.

187
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,670
Yes.

188
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:27,360
Then, through the clues, we found out

189
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,240
that the suspect fled all the way back to Shanghai.

190
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:31,480
The military police and I tracked him to the Yan residence.

191
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:33,960
But I didn't expect

192
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:35,790
that we wouldn't catch the suspect,

193
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,750
but instead, we ran into you.

194
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:40,870
Why were you at the Yan residence?

195
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:43,120
Don't tell me you were also there to catch the suspect.

196
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,480
And also,

197
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,000
since you've returned to Shanghai,

198
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:48,440
why didn't you go back to headquarters?

199
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:51,320
Brother Cui,

200
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,000
it's normal for you to want to know these things.

201
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,910
But some things

202
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:59,910
I can only talk about once I'm back at headquarters.

203
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:02,320
This time, in order to return to Shanghai,

204
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,200
I had to walk through the gates of hell more than once.

205
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,080
So please understand.

206
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,480
For me, trust

207
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:11,790
is a luxury right now.

208
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,360
I can understand that.

209
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,480
But I don't know if the director and the Japanese

210
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:17,720
will understand you.

211
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,750
The Peace Conference is about to be held.

212
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:22,080
Both sides need people right now.

213
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,720
Originally, among everyone at No. 76,

214
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,270
you were the most promising one.

215
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:28,080
But this mission failed.

216
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,120
Your loyalty assessment period

217
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:31,630
will probably be extended.

218
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,510
And the Japanese said

219
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:34,720
that regarding this incident,

220
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:36,440
a reasonable explanation must be given.

221
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,240
You should understand

222
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:40,120
what that means.

223
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:42,150
Peace Conference.

224
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,030
Loyalty assessment.

225
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,960
Loyalty assessment.

226
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:48,840
What assessment?

227
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,440
To me, it's just murder.

228
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,360
I know you're upset.

229
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,390
Originally, for this mission,

230
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,720
all you had to do was bring Yan Jiu back.

231
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,870
That would have been enough to complete it.

232
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:02,120
Whether or not you could get him

233
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,270
to reveal the whereabouts of the explosives,

234
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:04,200
no one could be sure.

235
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,030
After all, he's just a businessman.

236
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,550
So the root of the problem isn't here.

237
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:10,360
The problem is,

238
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:13,360
why didn't you bring him back on time?

239
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:15,390
As things stand now,

240
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:17,320
your position in the Special Agent Committee

241
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:19,120
probably won't be easy to advance.

242
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:20,440
Brother Cui,

243
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,360
do you think that's what I care about right now?

244
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:25,840
What do I care about,

245
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:27,960
don't you know?

246
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:30,510
I know.

247
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,390
You've always been decisive and efficient,

248
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:33,670
focused only on results.

249
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,120
That's exactly why

250
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,670
the director values you so much.

251
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,440
But do you know that Chen Gengsheng,

252
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:41,080
as soon as he heard you were in trouble,

253
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,120
immediately set his sights on your position?

254
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,790
And he's always trying to curry favor

255
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:46,840
with the Japanese, even when they ignore him.

256
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:48,390
Also,

257
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:51,360
he's never forgiven you for killing his cousin.

258
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,120
This time, your mistake was too big.

259
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:56,630
Just the fact that you returned to Shanghai instead of headquarters

260
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,510
is enough for him to go after you relentlessly.

261
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,360
I came back to Shanghai

262
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,240
and didn't go straight to headquarters

263
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:03,870
because there are still many things

264
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:05,270
that haven't been investigated clearly.

265
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:09,200
We’ve been through life and death together.

266
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:12,080
But if you can’t get past the Japanese

267
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,630
or the Chief,

268
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,720
the best I can do is leave your body intact.

269
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,030
Just kidding.

270
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:27,320
Don’t be so nervous.

271
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,120
If I could make it back alive from Yulong Mountain,

272
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,390
I can certainly handle the Japanese.

273
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,000
That’s exactly what I wanted to hear.

274
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:40,670
Let’s head back to headquarters.

275
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:18,960
The teacher's previous residence

276
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,270
was bought by a comprador.

277
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,550
This is the new office.

278
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:24,120
With so much spare money to invest in real estate,

279
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,790
it would be better to give me more guns and manpower.

280
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:29,200
The top priority now

281
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:31,440
is to gather the old members.

282
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:32,600
Understood.

283
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,150
I heard

284
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:36,480
that Brother Lu and the others

285
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,670
were bound to make sacrifices.

286
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,440
The living must carry on with heavy burdens.

287
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:42,870
Yes.

288
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:44,510
The office reconstruction

289
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:45,550
is up to you.

290
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:46,840
After all,

291
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,390
you know Shanghai better than I do.

292
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:49,150
I wouldn't dare.

293
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,440
I will strictly follow your orders.

294
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:51,870
Chengchun,

295
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,200
come with me to the Military Command's Shanghai station.

296
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:54,910
Yes.

297
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:04,550
Station Chief

298
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:05,790
Station Chief, Mr. Xie

299
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:06,960
Don't you know how to knock?

300
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,600
Get out.

301
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,360
Brother Wang

302
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,120
Under your leadership, the Shanghai station

303
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,360
is full of vitality.

304
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:13,910
Mr. Xie is here.

305
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:15,000
Hello, Chief Wang.

306
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:15,750
Hello.

307
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:19,550
Why didn't you report this earlier?

308
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,320
I told him not to report it.

309
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,720
Sorry, Brother Wang.

310
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:24,960
I'm in a hurry.

311
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:28,790
Mr. Xie

312
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:30,390
What are you saying?

313
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:31,840
It's not easy for you to come to Shanghai.

314
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,360
It's my duty to host you.

315
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:35,840
Please do me the honor, no matter what.

316
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,440
Let me be the host this time.

317
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,510
These are extraordinary times.

318
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:42,150
Brother Wang

319
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:43,270
I appreciate your invitation,

320
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:45,750
but I'm afraid I can't accept it.

321
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,120
The Japanese peace conference is about to be held.

322
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,120
The higher-ups have ordered

323
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:51,030
that I take charge of the Shanghai station.

324
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:52,360
Time is tight.

325
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,080
From now on, all operations

326
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,960
will need your support, Brother Wang.

327
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,200
I'm not here for anything else today.

328
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:01,960
Just to say hello first.

329
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:04,750
Please have a seat.

330
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,720
Sir, this time

331
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:12,200
you truly look travel-worn.

332
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:14,120
As for me here,

333
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,720
I haven't received any notification yet.

334
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:17,240
I'm not sure about the procedures.

335
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,120
Chengchun.

336
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,150
Station Chief Wang.

337
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:22,000
Please take a look.

338
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:22,910
No,

339
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:24,550
that's not what I meant.

340
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:28,200
Since you have no objections,

341
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:29,720
then I will also

342
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,790
consider this trip worthwhile.

343
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:33,120
It's my first time back in Shanghai.

344
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,440
There are many things to handle.

345
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:35,360
So,

346
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,840
I won't stay any longer.

347
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:38,510
Chengchun.

348
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:39,240
Let's go.

349
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:39,790
Yes.

350
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,550
Then I won't insist on keeping you, Mr. Xie.

351
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:43,200
Brother Wang,

352
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,630
I have a niece

353
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:46,320
who is currently working at the Shanghai station.

354
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:47,840
Her name is Xie Nianci.

355
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:49,600
I have other plans for her.

356
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:50,910
I must trouble you, Chief,

357
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:53,080
to immediately transfer all her files.

358
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:54,320
Officer Xie,

359
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,480
there is indeed such a person.

360
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:56,440
It's just that...

361
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,030
Just what?

362
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,360
She has already defected and fled.

363
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:01,720
Alright, alright.

364
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,670
Don't talk nonsense.

365
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:05,240
How could Officer Xie's family possibly defect?

366
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:06,960
She must have been transferred.

367
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:08,160
Yes, yes.

368
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,200
Transferred, transferred.

369
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,510
Since it's a transfer,

370
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:15,720
there should be a destination.

371
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,440
Of course.

372
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:17,590
But for such a trivial matter,

373
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:19,590
there's no need for you to worry, Mr. Xie.

374
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,830
I will investigate immediately.

375
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,750
And report back promptly.

376
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:26,240
I hope you can help arrange it as soon as possible, Brother Wang.

377
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:27,880
As people get older,

378
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:30,240
it's natural to miss their family more often.

379
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,070
I understand.

380
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,720
It's only human nature.

381
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:34,240
Thank you.

382
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,510
Take care.

383
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:51,640
I can't believe Boss Dai

384
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:54,000
actually let this troublemaker out.

385
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:56,790
How are we supposed to get by from now on?

386
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,030
Chief,

387
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,270
two tigers can't live on the same mountain.

388
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:04,200
How can our Shanghai station allow outsiders to interfere?

389
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,110
That Xie Nianci—

390
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,270
Did you do something behind my back

391
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:13,640
to her?

392
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:36,750
Boss, boss!

393
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:37,510
Boss!

394
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:42,960
You all

395
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:46,350
Are you okay?

396
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,510
We're fine.

397
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:48,550
We're fine.

398
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:49,640
It's you

399
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:51,310
who's been wronged.

400
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:53,440
Don't whine like a woman.

401
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:54,310
Isn't the boss

402
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:55,160
back safe and sound?

403
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:56,270
I'm happy the boss is back.

404
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:57,030
Don't mess with me, Lao Bai.

405
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:57,510
I

406
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:58,070
You

407
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,400
Are you still challenging me?

408
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,160
Look at you, acting all tough.

409
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:00,960
Enough.

410
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:02,790
Let's go back first and talk later.

411
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:03,920
See?

412
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:04,880
I told you long ago

413
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,030
that Director Liang is lucky and blessed.

414
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:07,310
Nothing would ever happen to him.

415
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:08,110
Isn't everything fine now?

416
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:09,270
Good people are always protected.

417
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:11,160
Hello, Director Liang.

418
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,110
I told you, I should have gone with them back then.

419
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:17,310
What do you know? Why would you go?

420
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:18,000
What good would that do?

421
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:19,160
With the way you are?

422
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:19,960
Enough, stop arguing.

423
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:20,720
Stop arguing.

424
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:21,480
That's enough.

425
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,640
Everyone, disperse. Go on.

426
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,830
Go back to whatever you were doing.

427
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:24,880
Everyone, disperse.

428
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,640
Director Liang is fine.

429
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,240
Everyone, disperse.

430
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:27,160
Let me tell you,

431
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:27,920
now that the boss is back,

432
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,030
don’t act cocky in front of me.

433
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:29,920
Let’s see how cocky you are now.

434
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:30,880
What did I do?

435
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,440
Look at yourself.

436
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,110
You were acting all tough when the boss wasn’t here.

437
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:35,400
Director Cui.

438
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,480
Team Leader Chen.

439
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:42,200
Where’s the director?

440
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:43,790
What is it?

441
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:45,680
Now that Director Liang is back,

442
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:47,310
aren’t you going to say hello?

443
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,000
The director sent me to pick up Liang Shuo.

444
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,270
Of course.

445
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:54,350
This is also Chief Hirata’s decision.

446
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:58,200
So you’re rebelling now?

447
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,000
Team Leader Chen.

448
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,030
The director asked Director Liang to attend the meeting.

449
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,270
With this kind of display,

450
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:04,920
what are you trying to do?

451
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,240
The meeting has been postponed for now.

452
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,350
Director Cui.

453
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,110
I’m just doing my duty.

454
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:13,440
You go with them first.

455
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,070
I’ll come find you later.

456
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:18,160
Please.

457
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:42,720
Liang Shuo

458
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:44,310
Director Liang

459
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:47,920
Should I call you Director,

460
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:49,830
or should I call you

461
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:51,240
anti-Japanese element?

462
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,440
But do you know that Chen Gengsheng,

463
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:55,830
as soon as he heard you were in trouble,

464
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:57,720
immediately set his sights on your position?

465
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,160
Most importantly,

466
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:01,160
he still holds a grudge

467
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:02,880
over you killing his cousin.

468
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:05,640
You locked me up here—

469
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,350
is it for official reasons,

470
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:09,960
or personal ones?

471
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,680
Of course, I'm just doing my job.

472
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:16,720
I have ample evidence to prove

473
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,240
that you are the assassin who ambushed the escort team.

474
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,440
Then why don't you

475
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,790
tell all this directly to the director?

476
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:23,590
Liang Shuo,

477
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,510
are you still trying to deny it?

478
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,750
Stop resisting.

479
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:30,160
I found traces of the assassin in Shanghai.

480
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,240
From the moment you were caught,

481
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,960
I was certain that the assassin

482
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:33,830
was you.

483
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,400
Ruijin Building,

484
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,590
Tailong Chamber of Commerce,

485
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:39,160
Pingjia Lane, and Yan Residence—

486
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,240
have you been to these places?

487
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,720
As long as I have your photo,

488
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,350
it's only a matter of time

489
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:44,640
before I find out.

490
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,200
Besides, the military police

491
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:48,440
have already conducted thorough autopsies

492
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,440
on the other four people who died at Yulong Mountain.

493
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,240
Liang Shuo,

494
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,200
you can't escape after killing someone.

495
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,640
Just confess honestly.

496
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,550
Team Leader Chen,

497
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,110
you've wanted to pin a crime on me for a long time, haven't you?

498
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,000
Go ahead,

499
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:08,400
how do you want me to confess?

500
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:11,310
Playing dumb, are you?

501
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:14,160
Liang Shuo, I'll make you regret this.

502
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,720
Why you didn't die at Yulong Mountain.

503
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:19,550
Team Leader

504
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:21,270
The charges are not yet determined.

505
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:22,720
He is the Director of Operations.

506
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:24,270
This is vigilantism.

507
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,720
Why not?

508
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:27,400
The evidence against him is conclusive.

509
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:30,200
I've got everything under control.

510
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,070
Liang Shuo, don't worry.

511
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,270
I will strictly control the timing.

512
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,830
I'll let you experience the feeling of near-death several times.

513
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,350
I'll ask you one more time.

514
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:46,550
What exactly happened on Yulong Mountain?

515
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:54,310
Do it.

516
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:37,680
Qibao

517
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,440
Turn it off.

518
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:40,000
Give me some peace and quiet.

519
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:40,960
Okay, boss.

520
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:41,960
I'll quiet down right away.

521
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:45,240
Always making a fool of yourself in front of Director Liang.

522
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:47,110
Please forgive us.

523
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:48,750
People brought from my hometown.

524
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:50,510
They don't know the rules.

525
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:51,750
It's fine.

526
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,880
It's a good song.

527
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:56,110
Director Liang.

528
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,480
What do you think this puzzle means?

529
00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:00,400
What does it really mean?

530
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:04,070
You really have a stubborn mouth.

531
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:13,830
The ones on the mission.

532
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:15,310
Including you, there were five people.

533
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,680
Ma Yuan

534
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:19,030
Gong Biao, Yan Jiu, and Ma Qibao are all dead.

535
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,070
Why are you the only one who survived?

536
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,030
How do you explain that?

537
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:25,510
Did you kill them?

538
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:29,880
Boss, Director Liang.

539
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,510
Try what I brought from my hometown.

540
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,680
Don't show off.

541
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:33,880
Just drive properly.

542
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,350
Gong Biao

543
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,750
You have some sense.

544
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:58,640
Liang Shuo

545
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:01,920
What kind of place is Interrogation Room 76?

546
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:03,880
You should know better than anyone.

547
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,270
Many people have come in.

548
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:07,160
But there's no chance of getting out.

549
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:08,830
If someone can survive,

550
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:10,720
why would they choose to die?

551
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:12,960
If someone can die all at once,

552
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,400
why would they choose to suffer bit by bit?

553
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,310
You just

554
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,590
have this little ability?

555
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:26,550
Get ready for the heavy torture.

556
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:02,960
Director

557
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:04,510
You're back.

558
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,790
Didn't you meet with Liang Shuo?

559
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:08,830
Where is he?

560
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,070
Didn't you tell Chen Gengsheng

561
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:12,350
to take him away?

562
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:14,160
Take away?

563
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:16,830
I never gave such an order.

564
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,830
That bastard.

565
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,200
He's really outrageous.

566
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,590
He must be taking matters into his own hands with Liang Shuo.

567
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:23,310
Stop!

568
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:24,480
Director.

569
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,640
You have to do something about this.

570
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,790
He's acting above the law.

571
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:28,880
Do something?

572
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:31,310
Of course I will.

573
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,680
But

574
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,920
before that,

575
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:36,750
there's something important

576
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,440
I need to make clear to you first.

577
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:39,680
Come.

578
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,480
Chen,

579
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,200
if you have the guts, kill me.

580
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:15,270
If I kill you,

581
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,920
how am I supposed to explain it to the Director?

582
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:19,960
Unless you confess,

583
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,310
I'll make it quick for you.

584
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,110
I'll ask you one last time.

585
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,000
The four people on Yulong Mountain—

586
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:28,240
were you the one who killed them?

587
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,550
Why did you show up at the Yan residence?

588
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:56,790
Since you returned to Shanghai,

589
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:58,790
why didn't you go back to headquarters?

590
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,790
Originally, this mission

591
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,160
only required bringing Yan Jiu back.

592
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,240
That would have been enough to complete it.

593
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:10,550
Whether or not we could get

594
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:11,790
the whereabouts of the explosives from him,

595
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:12,720
no one could say.

596
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:14,550
After all, he's just a businessman.

597
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:17,070
So the root of the problem isn't here.

598
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,680
The problem is,

599
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,240
why didn't you bring him back on time?

600
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,640
But since this mission failed,

601
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:29,440
your loyalty assessment period

602
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:30,720
will probably be extended.

603
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:34,640
Loyalty assessment?

604
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,750
What assessment?

605
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:40,030
To me, it looks like murder.

606
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:44,110
But if you can't get past the Japanese

607
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:45,640
and the Director,

608
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:49,680
the best I can do is leave your body intact.

609
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:53,640
How about it?

610
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,880
Can you talk now?

611
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,110
I want to see the director.

612
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,000
What?

613
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,680
I want to see the director.

614
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:03,830
See the director?

615
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:06,750
The director doesn't want to see you.

616
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,480
If you have something to say, just tell me.

617
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,070
Liang Shuo.

618
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:12,880
Unless you make things clear today,

619
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:13,790
otherwise,

620
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:16,000
you won't be able to leave this place.

621
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,790
I'll talk.

622
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,510
I'll talk.

623
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:22,160
If I can

624
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,070
get out

625
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:26,680
I'll make sure you die a horrible death.

626
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:30,200
Increase the voltage.

627
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:31,550
Team leader.

628
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,400
If we increase it again, he might not make it.

629
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,160
Do it.

630
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:34,920
Stop!

631
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,480
Screw you!

632
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,110
Get lost!

633
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:38,960
Chen Gengsheng.

634
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,550
Do you even know what you're doing?

635
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:41,110
You're doing this to a

636
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:42,720
director from the Special Agent Headquarters.

637
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:44,070
I could shoot you right now.

638
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:45,000
Director Cui.

639
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:47,590
It's only a matter of time before Liang Shuo confesses.

640
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:48,790
Torture in the morning or at night,

641
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:50,070
what difference does it make?

642
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:51,550
But you getting so worked up

643
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:52,720
makes people wonder.

644
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:53,680
Screw you!

645
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,110
Even if this goes to the Central Executive Committee,

646
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:56,200
I’m not afraid.

647
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,270
Let him go.

648
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:58,350
Liang Shuo.

649
00:29:58,510 --> 00:29:59,350
Liang Shuo.

650
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:00,550
Liang Shuo.

651
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:03,590
Director.

652
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,400
Director.

653
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:16,480
How are you?

654
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,240
Can you still stand?

655
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:21,680
I’m not dead yet.

656
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:24,880
Chief Hirata is here.

657
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:26,720
What is it?

658
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,720
We’ll talk later.

659
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,310
Go.

660
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:30,680
For Director Liang,

661
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:32,240
get him a change of clothes.

662
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,110
Clean him up.

663
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,440
Come on.

664
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:51,310
Team Leader Chen

665
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:53,310
That's too much.

666
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:56,310
Yes.

667
00:30:56,830 --> 00:30:57,920
Director Liang

668
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,200
Has he confessed?

669
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,110
Not yet.

670
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:04,160
Gather in the third-floor conference room.

671
00:31:04,550 --> 00:31:05,640
Get ready for the meeting.

672
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:06,590
Also,

673
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:07,720
have Director Liang

674
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:08,880
change clothes

675
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:10,510
and freshen up before coming over.

676
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:11,510
Yes.

677
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:27,720
Open the door.

678
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:30,350
How is it?

679
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,680
Let me be alone for a while.

680
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:38,920
I'll wait for you at the door.

681
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:05,350
Liang Shuo

682
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:06,270
What are you going to do?

683
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,160
Uncle Yan

684
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:15,270
Uncle Yan

685
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:17,960
You rest for a bit.

686
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:19,510
I'll try to find a car.

687
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,880
Silly boy.

688
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,720
I can't go anymore.

689
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:34,680
Uncle Yan

690
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:41,350
Uncle Yan

691
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,400
What are you going to do?

692
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,960
We can figure something out.

693
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:46,160
Find

694
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,790
the key.

695
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:51,310
If I die,

696
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:53,270
only then can you live.

697
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:54,750
and complete the mission.

698
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:55,720
Uncle Yan

699
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:00,920
Mission

700
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,110
You must be clear

701
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:03,350
about what the mission is

702
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:04,880
Complete it

703
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,200
Do everything you can

704
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,750
Even if it costs your life

705
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,280
Do you remember

706
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,710
what I once told you?

707
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:20,000
Life is not just about surviving

708
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,960
but about seeking light and forging your soul

709
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:23,440
and passing on the torch with determination

710
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:24,760
Liang Shuo

711
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:27,320
You must make sense of this

712
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:38,880
During the Peace Conference

713
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:41,110
while undergoing the loyalty test on the eve

714
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:43,230
you were ordered to go to Yulong Mountain

715
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:45,920
to carry out an operation to capture Yan Jiu

716
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,710
The goal was to seize

717
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:51,760
the Military Command agent Scorpion

718
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,360
and the explosives he was transporting

719
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,360
But something unexpected happened during the operation

720
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,190
The others are dead

721
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:01,960
Only you are still alive

722
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,440
You killed them

723
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:08,030
If you are from Unit 76

724
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:10,110
why did you kill them?

725
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:12,510
Could it be

726
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:15,110
that you have another identity?

727
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:20,510
Since Scorpion caused all of this

728
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:23,670
let him bear the consequences

729
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,480
Was Scorpion present at the scene?

730
00:35:26,510 --> 00:35:27,800
No one can prove it

731
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:29,670
Use this to your advantage

732
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:31,760
Maybe you can get away with it

733
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,510
If you want to deceive the devil,

734
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:02,400
you have to become the devil.

735
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:03,840
No matter what,

736
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,400
you must survive first.

737
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,070
Liang Shuo,

738
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:09,000
from now on,

739
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:12,480
you are the Director of Operations of Unit 76.

740
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:24,400
Director Liang,

741
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:31,110
can you handle it?

742
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:44,550
Hello, Director.

743
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:51,000
Directors,

744
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,960
the Chief and Officer Hirata

745
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:55,000
have been waiting for a long time.

746
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:56,630
Please.

747
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:17,510
Director Liang

748
00:37:17,590 --> 00:37:18,760
You've been wronged.

749
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:21,840
According to the regulations of the Central Executive Committee,

750
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:24,510
without solid evidence,

751
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,550
officials of our new government

752
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:28,110
must not be subjected to torture.

753
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:30,510
But some people

754
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:31,920
have violated these regulations.

755
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:33,880
Director Liang

756
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,480
as long as you can prove your innocence,

757
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:37,000
then that person

758
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
should be punished accordingly.

759
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,630
Let me introduce

760
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:44,800
this is

761
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,880
Mr. Mizuno from the Mei Agency,

762
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,590
who has been sent to assist with the investigation.

763
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:50,480
Miss Hirata Kiko

764
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:53,150
is the inspector stationed at No. 76.

765
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:57,360
During the preparations for the Peace Conference,

766
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:59,710
all actions of the Special Operations Unit

767
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:04,630
will be supervised and carried out by Chief Hirata.

768
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:06,550
Chief Hirata

769
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:07,440
A pleasure to meet you.

770
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:11,030
Director Cui

771
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,590
No need to be so formal.

772
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,000
Director Liang

773
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,110
I hope you've been well.

774
00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:21,510
Alright,

775
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:23,000
everyone, please have a seat.

776
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:30,360
Head of the Communications and Interrogation Department,

777
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,760
Group Leader Chen Gengsheng

778
00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:33,880
was specifically

779
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:36,000
assigned by Miss Hirata to assist with the investigation.

780
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:37,190
Well then,

781
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:39,760
please have a seat as well.

782
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,150
Yes.

783
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:50,110
Director

784
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:54,510
I hope this will be a fair hearing.

785
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:55,760
Rest assured.

786
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,920
The purpose of today's meeting

787
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,070
is surely clear to everyone present.

788
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:02,480
We carried out an operation at Yulong Mountain

789
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:05,440
to escort the key criminal Yan Jiu back to Shanghai.

790
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:06,630
But the operation failed.

791
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:10,030
The entire escort team was wiped out.

792
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,800
Only you, Director Liang,

793
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,550
returned alive.

794
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:15,030
Therefore,

795
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:17,360
we have reason to ask

796
00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:20,590
what exactly happened during the process.

797
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:23,670
Of course.

798
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,920
The military police were the first

799
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,800
to arrive at the scene of the incident.

800
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,280
Ms. Hirata,

801
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,230
please begin.

802
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:32,360
Alright.

803
00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:37,360
Then I would like to ask Director Liang

804
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:40,070
to answer a few questions first.

805
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:50,590
First,

806
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,480
I need to add something.

807
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,110
Escorting the key criminal Yan Jiu

808
00:39:55,110 --> 00:39:57,400
was the responsibility of the 76th Operations Division.

809
00:39:57,550 --> 00:39:58,710
But this also

810
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:02,590
concerns the trust of Mr. Mizuno from Meihua Hall.

811
00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:04,400
Of course.

812
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:07,760
First,

813
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:09,710
Director Liang and Ma Yuan'an

814
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:12,480
during the escort of Yan Jiu,

815
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:14,400
what exactly happened?

816
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:16,510
Second,

817
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,960
the scene was extremely tragic.

818
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:20,320
Except for Director Liang,

819
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:21,550
everyone else was killed.

820
00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:23,360
So I would like to ask Director Liang,

821
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,400
how did you

822
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,400
manage to escape with your life?

823
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:38,710
Third,

824
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,710
After the incident, Director Liang

825
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,070
why didn't you request assistance from the military police squad?

826
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,670
After returning to Shanghai,

827
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:47,670
why didn't you immediately report to headquarters?

828
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:49,400
There are three questions in total.

829
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:50,760
Director Liang, please

830
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:53,190
explain them one by one.

831
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:04,030
Quiet.

832
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:06,960
May I have a cigarette?

833
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:47,960
Sir

834
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,480
Here are the documents you requested.

835
00:42:02,110 --> 00:42:03,840
The latest autopsy report for the Yulong Mountain case.

836
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,630
It seems different from what was said before.

837
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:06,710
Please take a look.
