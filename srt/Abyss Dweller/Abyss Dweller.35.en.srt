1
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,799
Liang Shuo is an underground party member.

2
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:48,920
Captain Takagi

3
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,239
Are you trying to

4
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:52,040
seek our help?

5
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:53,959
Director Li

6
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,439
Let me remind you

7
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,159
that cooperating with the military police

8
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:58,439
is the headquarters' duty.

9
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:00,879
We lost track of him around the Suzhou River.

10
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:02,040
Where would Liang Shuo go?

11
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:04,200
I believe those who spend time with him every day

12
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,920
should know better than we do.

13
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:06,879
Also,

14
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:07,920
Director, please

15
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,759
form a

16
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:10,159
temporary special operations team as soon as possible.

17
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,360
This is a top priority.

18
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,520
Is there a suitable candidate?

19
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:21,199
Has Cui Mo returned?

20
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,639
He's busy with his wife's funeral.

21
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:26,159
I've checked on him a few times.

22
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,879
His mental state

23
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:29,000
is really unstable.

24
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:33,599
Have Old Wu from the special operations team come back to lead.

25
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,800
Call Cui Mo.

26
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,919
If he can't get himself together,

27
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:39,080
and still doesn't come back to work,

28
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,240
then tell him to get lost.

29
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:41,960
Yes.

30
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:54,560
Brother Cui,

31
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,680
you're here just in time.

32
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,840
Help me take a look at

33
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:09,080
this necklace.

34
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,879
She used to wear it often.

35
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,199
She really liked it.

36
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,439
And there's this pendant.

37
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:27,800
It's made of ruby.

38
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:31,400
I had someone bring it back for her from France.

39
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:36,360
Which one do you think she'll like?

40
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,560
What do you think?

41
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:42,879
They're all nice.

42
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,159
You're right.

43
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:51,719
She looks good in anything.

44
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,759
Then bring them all to her.

45
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:02,479
She can wear whichever one she wants.

46
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:13,040
Thank you.

47
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,240
We’re brothers for life.

48
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:21,319
No need to thank me.

49
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:26,680
Is there nothing else you want to say to me?

50
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,800
What do you want me to say?

51
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:42,399
I always thought I had wronged you.

52
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:48,040
I never expected this.

53
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,879
I really misjudged you.

54
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,040
So, are you going to turn me in to the Special Agent Headquarters?

55
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,040
Does it even matter anymore?

56
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,879
I’m not like them.

57
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,360
Whether it’s betraying the country for personal gain,

58
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:07,920
or for the so-called Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity,

59
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:10,680
I helped the Japanese and the 76th Division

60
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,800
do so many things,

61
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:15,800
all just to carve out

62
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,040
a safe haven for the two of us in this chaotic world.

63
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,240
But you were right.

64
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:25,160
When the nest is destroyed,

65
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,720
no egg can remain intact.

66
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:33,199
You want me to leave.

67
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,519
The path you chose is the right one.

68
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,480
My path

69
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:41,240
was wrong from the very beginning.

70
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,720
Besides,

71
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,439
I want to make Mizuno Shingen suffer.

72
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:52,600
About what happened to our sister-in-law,

73
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:54,680
I’m also deeply saddened.

74
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,600
As long as you still see me as your brother, that’s enough.

75
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:08,040
Do you want to come with me?

76
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,199
How could I?

77
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:14,240
Have you forgotten?

78
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:18,319
My hands are stained with too much blood.

79
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,279
It can never be washed clean.

80
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:25,160
If one day I’m caught,

81
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,600
and put on trial,

82
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,720
For the sake of our many years of brotherhood,

83
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,559
go to your sister-in-law's grave every year

84
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:36,159
and pay your respects.

85
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,559
I’ll remember.

86
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:43,399
Alright.

87
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:44,720
Let’s go.

88
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:46,720
I still have things to do.

89
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,799
I can only see you off this far.

90
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:25,960
Take care.

91
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:14,559
He has been here.

92
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,519
Whose shop is this?

93
00:10:17,559 --> 00:10:18,360
Chief

94
00:10:18,679 --> 00:10:19,279
Upon investigation

95
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:20,960
This is the headquarters of the agents.

96
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,720
Director Cui's shop

97
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:23,799
A few days ago

98
00:10:23,799 --> 00:10:26,879
There was a conflict here involving people from the police department.

99
00:10:31,639 --> 00:10:32,559
Cui Mo

100
00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:00,399
Our emperor's prosperous reign

101
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:04,799
For thousands of generations

102
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:06,639
Gravel

103
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:10,320
Becomes rock

104
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,600
Covered in moss

105
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,440
Covered in moss

106
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:31,240
Who is there?

107
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,080
I'm just an ordinary woman.

108
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,039
I just want to be with you.

109
00:13:02,039 --> 00:13:04,159
To live a peaceful life together.

110
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:07,240
I want to grow old with you.

111
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,440
In my heart, you are

112
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,360
the best in the whole world.

113
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,039
My wife.

114
00:13:15,159 --> 00:13:16,360
In this world,

115
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,679
only in your heart

116
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,360
am I a good person.

117
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,440
The things I've done,

118
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,799
even my ancestors wouldn't acknowledge me after I die.

119
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:33,960
I'll go to hell.

120
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,840
And only to the lowest level.

121
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:42,240
It was me who caused the death of you and our child.

122
00:14:01,159 --> 00:14:02,039
Director Cui.

123
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,120
My condolences.

124
00:14:09,159 --> 00:14:11,320
I'm sorry for what happened to your wife.

125
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,840
This is all a misunderstanding.

126
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,279
Chief.

127
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:22,559
There's blood on Cui Mo's car downstairs.

128
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:24,919
Director Cui.

129
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:27,720
Liang Shuo.

130
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,679
Where is he?

131
00:14:32,919 --> 00:14:33,840
Director Cui.

132
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,840
I'll ask you again.

133
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,759
Where is Liang Shuo?

134
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,120
Director Cui.

135
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,960
Even if I gave you another head, it wouldn't save you.

136
00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:02,279
Mizuno Shingen.

137
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:03,960
Do you drink tea?

138
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,519
How dare you call your superior by name?

139
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:28,360
I've done so many bad things for you Japanese.

140
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,039
I always thought

141
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,799
it was for myself and my family,

142
00:15:31,879 --> 00:15:33,360
that I had chosen the safest path.

143
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,799
But it turns out I was wrong.

144
00:15:36,879 --> 00:15:37,960
Completely wrong.

145
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,480
If I could do it all over again,

146
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,960
I definitely wouldn't choose this path.

147
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:46,360
But unfortunately,

148
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,679
there are no do-overs in life.

149
00:15:52,279 --> 00:15:53,279
Director Cui,

150
00:15:54,519 --> 00:15:56,720
I don't understand what you're saying.

151
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:00,000
Are you planning to betray us?

152
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,080
When I saw

153
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,200
my wife's cold corpse

154
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:09,960
and my innocent child,

155
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:11,919
I knew then

156
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,720
this was the retribution I deserved.

157
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,000
It was me, together with you beasts,

158
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,679
who killed them.

159
00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:25,559
Do you have a death wish?

160
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:31,240
Before getting news about Liang Shuo,

161
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,279
Mizuno won't let you kill me.

162
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,159
Use your brain.

163
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,679
I've been a dog for half my life,

164
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,799
causing the deaths of so many people,

165
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,440
and ended up with my family destroyed.

166
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:51,720
Only now do I finally understand what Liang Shuo once told me:

167
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:54,240
When the nest is overturned,

168
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,519
no egg can remain intact.

169
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,120
Leave him alive.

170
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,000
I'll be waiting for you in hell.

171
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,319
He took poison.

172
00:18:17,799 --> 00:18:19,240
They all sacrificed themselves.

173
00:18:21,079 --> 00:18:22,119
I even

174
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,400
can't remember the names of many of them.

175
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:29,119
I'm sorry.

176
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:32,160
I'm sorry, Old Tan.

177
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,279
I know everything.

178
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,599
You don't need to apologize.

179
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:42,400
I was the one who planned the support operation.

180
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:45,079
I'm the one who should reflect on this.

181
00:18:46,839 --> 00:18:47,880
You've already taken on

182
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,319
too much.

183
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,119
You're safe now.

184
00:18:55,319 --> 00:18:56,359
Let's leave here.

185
00:18:57,079 --> 00:18:58,720
You need to get some proper rest.

186
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,640
What is this?

187
00:19:20,039 --> 00:19:21,200
The Trinity list.

188
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,160
I have fulfilled my mission.

189
00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:27,279
Is this the complete list?

190
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:30,000
Unfortunately, he didn't have time to capture the whole thing.

191
00:19:32,119 --> 00:19:33,000
This is enough.

192
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,559
As long as we have the names of these collaborators

193
00:19:35,559 --> 00:19:36,720
and Japanese spies,

194
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,039
we can root them all out.

195
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:04,720
Let's go.

196
00:20:06,279 --> 00:20:06,920
Hurry up.

197
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:07,720
Sir.

198
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:11,839
Reporting, sir.

199
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:12,799
These

200
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:14,200
are all local shopkeepers.

201
00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:22,759
Did you see the suspect?

202
00:20:29,079 --> 00:20:30,279
Did you see the suspect?

203
00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:39,440
Did you see the suspect?

204
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,880
Did you two see him?

205
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:53,799
Did you see it?

206
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,119
I'm asking if you saw the suspect.

207
00:20:56,119 --> 00:20:56,599
No.

208
00:20:56,599 --> 00:20:57,599
Did you see him?

209
00:20:57,599 --> 00:20:59,759
You useless fool.

210
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:05,720
Keep searching.

211
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:06,240
Yes.

212
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,359
Continue the search.

213
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:08,160
Yes.

214
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,279
We just received some news.

215
00:21:27,799 --> 00:21:29,079
Takagi Yuyi's military police

216
00:21:29,319 --> 00:21:30,680
are searching everywhere for you.

217
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,279
We have to leave immediately.

218
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,240
Given the current situation,

219
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:36,720
leaving Shanghai

220
00:21:37,559 --> 00:21:38,680
is the best option.

221
00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:45,240
Their sacrifice can't be in vain.

222
00:21:47,319 --> 00:21:49,599
My mission isn't finished yet.

223
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,000
I understand how you feel right now.

224
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:53,319
I'm just like you.

225
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,279
Old Chen

226
00:21:55,279 --> 00:21:56,599
has been my friend for over ten years.

227
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,720
What we need to do now

228
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:01,880
is to preserve our strength.

229
00:22:03,079 --> 00:22:04,599
As long as you're in Shanghai,

230
00:22:04,759 --> 00:22:07,000
they'll never stop hunting you.

231
00:22:14,039 --> 00:22:16,039
I'm tired of running.

232
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,160
What do you want to do?

233
00:22:29,839 --> 00:22:30,640
Mr. Tan

234
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,200
Mr. Tan

235
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,079
You need to leave quickly.

236
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:36,480
I heard several civilians around the jewelry store

237
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:38,640
were all shot by Takagi.

238
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,319
That bastard.

239
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:41,559
You need to

240
00:22:41,559 --> 00:22:43,720
immediately take the letters we use to contact the organization.

241
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:44,400
Also,

242
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,680
any documents we can't take with us in time

243
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,720
must be destroyed on the spot.

244
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,400
We can't leave any traces behind.

245
00:22:49,279 --> 00:22:50,160
Otherwise,

246
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,359
Takagi Yuyi

247
00:22:51,559 --> 00:22:53,279
will definitely take it out on the nearby residents.

248
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,079
Yes.

249
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:00,200
Hurry up and pack things up.

250
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:01,799
Let's go.

251
00:23:29,559 --> 00:23:30,000
Here.

252
00:23:32,839 --> 00:23:33,240
Lao Tan,

253
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:34,559
do we still need this document?

254
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,400
Let me see.

255
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:38,559
Lao Tan, how should we handle this?

256
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:39,920
Destroy this one.

257
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:41,920
Quickly.

258
00:24:05,799 --> 00:24:06,480
Lao Tan.

259
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,240
Lao Tan.

260
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,680
There's new information.

261
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,799
We need you to come over.

262
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:17,000
I have to take care of some urgent matters.

263
00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:18,200
You go to the rendezvous point first.

264
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,359
I'll be there right away.

265
00:24:25,759 --> 00:24:26,119
Let's go.

266
00:24:26,119 --> 00:24:26,799
This way.

267
00:24:57,319 --> 00:24:58,400
Why not search this place?

268
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:01,880
It seems like no one is here.

269
00:25:02,839 --> 00:25:03,400
Yes.

270
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,400
Just left

271
00:25:53,559 --> 00:25:54,640
Search

272
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,720
Don't miss any clues

273
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:57,519
Yes

274
00:26:16,039 --> 00:26:16,960
Salute

275
00:26:27,599 --> 00:26:28,440
Mizuno

276
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:30,440
You broke our agreement

277
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:34,680
The 31 list is in your hands, isn't it?

278
00:26:35,079 --> 00:26:36,119
According to our agreement

279
00:26:36,519 --> 00:26:38,440
You should be sharing information with me, shouldn't you?

280
00:26:39,559 --> 00:26:40,680
This unremarkable stack of papers

281
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,680
holds such terrifying power

282
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,680
You can't imagine

283
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:44,160
My original intention

284
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,400
was just to do my intelligence work well

285
00:26:46,599 --> 00:26:48,079
I used to think

286
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,480
you would get the meat

287
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,359
and I'd be fine with just the soup

288
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,079
But now I don't think that way anymore

289
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:55,839
So

290
00:26:55,839 --> 00:26:57,160
now you

291
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:59,640
believe Asai Hisashi's nonsense?

292
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:16,640
How is it?

293
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,200
He hasn't shown up.

294
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:19,720
Mr. Tan.

295
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:20,920
Where could he have gone?

296
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:23,920
I'm worried about him.

297
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,599
He might do something unexpected again.

298
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:27,839
Should I go back and check?

299
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:28,759
Wait a moment.

300
00:27:30,119 --> 00:27:31,039
Let me go instead.

301
00:27:34,519 --> 00:27:35,440
You wait for him here.

302
00:27:35,799 --> 00:27:36,920
If you spot any Japanese,

303
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:37,880
evacuate immediately.

304
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:39,559
Yes.

305
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,000
That's right.

306
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,599
Senior Asai is an idealist.

307
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:46,799
But I have always

308
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:48,039
been a pragmatist.

309
00:27:49,359 --> 00:27:51,680
Manchukuo has existed for eight years now.

310
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,920
Puyi has long since become a complete puppet.

311
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:56,440
In reality, he has no influence among the people.

312
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,079
Wang Jingwei is even more despised by all Chinese.

313
00:27:59,079 --> 00:28:01,720
It's time for some changes.

314
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,240
Perhaps His Majesty the Emperor

315
00:28:03,839 --> 00:28:05,920
could not accomplish his great ambitions in China,

316
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,240
but I might be able to achieve them.

317
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,359
Aren't you looking forward to it?

318
00:28:09,759 --> 00:28:11,400
Do you even know what you're saying, kid?

319
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,720
Don't talk to me like that.

320
00:28:23,359 --> 00:28:24,079
This list—

321
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:26,119
I will definitely hand it over to the military.

322
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:27,759
But

323
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,759
how it's used is up to me.

324
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,240
Stop the car.

325
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:34,519
Go over and take a look.

326
00:29:38,759 --> 00:29:39,640
Hurry up and drive.

327
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,160
Identification.

328
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,240
Search him.

329
00:29:51,799 --> 00:29:52,480
Next.

330
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:53,640
Identification.

331
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:54,960
Go.

332
00:29:56,359 --> 00:29:57,119
It's your turn.

333
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:50,839
Support requested

334
00:30:50,839 --> 00:30:51,720
Hurry

335
00:30:52,279 --> 00:30:53,000
Hurry

336
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,240
Hurry

337
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,319
Hurry

338
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,799
This time, it's for Jiang Feiman

339
00:32:17,319 --> 00:32:19,559
This time, it's for Lu Xijian

340
00:32:32,839 --> 00:32:34,920
This time, it's for Chen Zhonghai

341
00:32:35,559 --> 00:32:37,279
and for our fallen comrades

342
00:32:42,119 --> 00:32:44,240
You are Scorpio

343
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:04,880
Over there

344
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:27,319
Liang Shuo

345
00:33:27,319 --> 00:33:28,000
Retreat quickly

346
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:34,680
Retreat

347
00:33:34,759 --> 00:33:35,319
Yes

348
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:40,720
Chase them

349
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:48,400
Mizuno

350
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:49,799
Where is Liang Shuo?

351
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,599
Today, I must make him pay with his life

352
00:33:53,599 --> 00:33:56,240
I swear I won't rest until I avenge my nephew

353
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,519
Brother Takagi

354
00:34:02,839 --> 00:34:04,359
Please be patient for now

355
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,640
We will definitely help you get what you want

356
00:34:06,839 --> 00:34:08,679
The peace conference is about to begin

357
00:34:09,559 --> 00:34:12,000
Let's focus on what's in front of us, alright?

358
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,199
You'd better keep your word

359
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,719
Let me emphasize this again

360
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:18,679
Liang Shuo's life must be mine

361
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,079
If you can't do that

362
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:21,480
then our cooperation

363
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:24,199
will end as soon as the peace conference is over

364
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:25,360
Do you understand?

365
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,519
Takagi, you bastard.

366
00:34:32,519 --> 00:34:33,719
How dare you talk to me like that.

367
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,480
Chief.

368
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,400
It's my incompetence.

369
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,239
When it comes to these underground agents,

370
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:39,159
right now, all we can do

371
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:40,760
is kill a few to let Takagi vent his anger.

372
00:34:41,039 --> 00:34:42,599
What I’m worried about is

373
00:34:42,599 --> 00:34:43,480
they’re trying to find a way

374
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:45,199
to escape Shanghai as soon as possible.

375
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:48,159
Guard every entrance and exit strictly.

376
00:34:48,559 --> 00:34:49,760
Don’t let a single one slip through.

377
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:50,440
Yes, sir.

378
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:52,639
The underground party has lost its momentum.

379
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,840
Once the Peace Conference is successfully held,

380
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,719
nothing will be able to change the outcome.

381
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,039
By tomorrow,

382
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,800
nothing will be able to change the outcome.

383
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:01,800
Order headquarters

384
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,199
to inform all participants

385
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:06,159
that the banquet will be held at the hotel.

386
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:06,760
Yes, sir.

387
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:07,519
Understood.

388
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:40,039
First of all,

389
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,159
thank you

390
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,679
to all the reporters

391
00:35:43,039 --> 00:35:44,760
and local gentry for coming.

392
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,360
Let us together

393
00:35:46,559 --> 00:35:48,599
wish the Peace Conference

394
00:35:48,599 --> 00:35:49,920
a complete success.

395
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:51,800
Good, good.

396
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,119
Let us build Greater East Asia's prosperity together.

397
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,159
May the friendship between Japan and China last forever.

398
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,039
Good, good.

399
00:35:58,639 --> 00:35:59,719
The most important thing right now

400
00:35:59,719 --> 00:36:00,679
is to preserve our strength

401
00:36:00,679 --> 00:36:01,639
and retreat to the north of the river.

402
00:36:04,599 --> 00:36:05,239
Let's go.

403
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,920
You've already killed Takagi Yuyi.

404
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,039
If you don't leave now,

405
00:36:08,239 --> 00:36:09,280
once the conference begins,

406
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,039
the Japanese

407
00:36:10,039 --> 00:36:11,480
will seal off all the exits.

408
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,239
By then,

409
00:36:13,239 --> 00:36:14,400
you really won't be able to leave.

410
00:36:20,639 --> 00:36:21,719
Tomorrow morning at five

411
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:22,840
at Qingfeng Teahouse,

412
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:23,480
I'll wait for you.

413
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:24,559
Old Tan.

414
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,920
The new venue for the Peace Conference

415
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:32,760
and the topographic map

416
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,079
I couldn't bring them out

417
00:37:34,199 --> 00:37:35,519
but I've already memorized them

418
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:35,719
but I've already memorized them

419
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:37,559
Let me explain

420
00:37:37,719 --> 00:37:38,920
You help me draw it

421
00:37:39,039 --> 00:37:39,679
Okay

422
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,199
We have to find a way to get into the venue.

423
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,440
We still need to come up with some ideas.

424
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:34,199
Let's make some preparations.

425
00:39:05,719 --> 00:39:06,480
Sir

426
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,480
Time's up

427
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,119
He won't be coming

428
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:14,639
Brothers

429
00:39:14,639 --> 00:39:15,559
Work hard

430
00:39:15,559 --> 00:39:16,039
Hurry up

431
00:39:16,039 --> 00:39:18,119
You'll get an extra steamed bun tonight

432
00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:18,519
Okay

433
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:19,000
Hurry up

434
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:19,880
Put in more effort

435
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:21,760
Don't slack off

436
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:23,719
Hurry up

437
00:39:26,119 --> 00:39:27,320
You, hurry up, did you hear me?

438
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,039
Move it

439
00:39:28,039 --> 00:39:28,920
I'm talking to you

440
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:30,559
Quick

441
00:39:34,119 --> 00:39:34,760
What are you doing?

442
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:35,559
Get up.

443
00:39:35,559 --> 00:39:37,039
Sir, please stop hitting him.

444
00:39:37,039 --> 00:39:38,199
Stop hitting him, sir.

445
00:39:38,679 --> 00:39:39,559
You, get up.

446
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:40,800
Slacking off, huh?

447
00:39:42,119 --> 00:39:42,760
Hurry up and get up.

448
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:43,719
Stop hitting him.

449
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:44,880
What are you doing, rebelling?

450
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:45,719
What right do you have to hit people?

451
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,000
He didn't do it on purpose.

452
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,199
Because I feel like it.

453
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:51,320
Sir, sir.

454
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:52,679
It's fine, it's fine.

455
00:39:52,679 --> 00:39:53,440
It's fine now.

456
00:39:53,519 --> 00:39:54,280
Get to work.

457
00:39:54,719 --> 00:39:55,519
Everyone, get to work.

458
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:56,800
Get to work, stop staring.

459
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:57,639
Work.

460
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:58,679
Work faster, hurry up.

461
00:39:58,880 --> 00:39:59,599
It's fine, it's fine.

462
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:00,599
Be alert.

463
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:01,679
Are you okay?

464
00:40:02,559 --> 00:40:03,039
Hurry up.

465
00:40:03,039 --> 00:40:03,519
I'm fine.

466
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:04,760
It's fine, it's fine.

467
00:40:07,679 --> 00:40:08,320
You two.

468
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:08,960
Go over there.

469
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,159
Take it easy.

470
00:40:10,239 --> 00:40:11,239
Move faster.

471
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:15,079
Coming, coming.

472
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:46,440
Director

473
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:47,840
Everything is ready.

474
00:40:48,119 --> 00:40:49,119
All the officers

475
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,239
have arrived.

476
00:40:50,519 --> 00:40:52,360
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs hopes you can attend on time

477
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:54,280
to show our sincerity.

478
00:41:01,239 --> 00:41:04,719
The Army has coveted this war intelligence for a long time.

479
00:41:04,719 --> 00:41:07,119
Now, it is all in my hands.

480
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:09,719
China will belong to the Empire of Japan,

481
00:41:10,039 --> 00:41:10,679
and I

482
00:41:10,679 --> 00:41:11,960
will make history.

483
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,039
Yes.

484
00:41:13,639 --> 00:41:15,599
It's almost time.

485
00:41:17,079 --> 00:41:17,880
After you.

486
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:28,599
Please, go in.
