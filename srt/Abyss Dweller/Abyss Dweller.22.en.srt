1
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,280
As an intelligence broker,

2
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:49,000
her behavior yesterday

3
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,400
was different from usual.

4
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,519
The teacher only did it because of this.

5
00:01:55,879 --> 00:01:57,239
It's just because of this.

6
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,599
Don't forget,

7
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,280
among our opponents,

8
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,480
besides the Japanese,

9
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,480
only the Communists

10
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,519
have fought a long struggle against us.

11
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,879
But what if we make a mistake?

12
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:11,400
We

13
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:13,599
could indeed be wrong.

14
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,560
But even if we're wrong,

15
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:17,879
we absolutely can't let a single one go.

16
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,240
Whenever I think

17
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,360
that our information might be leaked,

18
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,960
I get restless.

19
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,120
In any case,

20
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,919
the Shanghai underground party hasn't

21
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:29,080
actually done anything to us.

22
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:31,560
The students think the top priority right now

23
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:33,719
is the peace conference against the Japanese.

24
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:35,639
As for matters concerning the Communists,

25
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,639
we can discuss them further later.

26
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:42,960
Since you can say such things,

27
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:44,560
it seems you've forgotten

28
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,599
the lessons your teacher usually gives you.

29
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:47,599
I wouldn't dare.

30
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:49,759
If it weren't for the fact that

31
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:51,199
you've followed me for many years,

32
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:53,120
just for those two sentences you said,

33
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:56,520
I could send you back to the Chongqing Special Training Office

34
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,800
to study politics for another two years.

35
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,080
Arrest Jiang Feiman immediately.

36
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,240
But we've worked with her for so long.

37
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:09,199
Her work is special.

38
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:10,639
If we delay any longer,

39
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:12,680
we'll have even more intelligence

40
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:13,879
leaked out.

41
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,360
The information on the list

42
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,639
must never fall into the hands of the Communists.

43
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:19,800
Take people to Pingchuan Academy immediately

44
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,039
and arrest Jiang Feiman.

45
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:22,439
If there's any resistance,

46
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:23,280
shoot on the spot.

47
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:27,000
You've been with me for a long time,

48
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,039
you should know

49
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:30,159
what my taboos are.

50
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:35,520
If you can't do it,

51
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:36,919
I'll have someone else do it.

52
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,319
I can.

53
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,520
I can.

54
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,520
Lao Qi,

55
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:09,960
the rest

56
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:11,439
I'll leave to you.

57
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:12,120
Understood.

58
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:55,120
Next

59
00:04:58,319 --> 00:04:59,519
Please hand over your sidearm.

60
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,839
You even brought a pen to the banquet.

61
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,560
That's pretty particular.

62
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,519
Is that not allowed?

63
00:05:42,519 --> 00:05:43,639
Search him.

64
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:03,399
Zhou Andao.

65
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:05,759
He returned to headquarters at 11:10 that day.

66
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:08,360
The reason for going out was material allocation.

67
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,240
But the supplies for the Special Agent Headquarters

68
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:13,160
have always been allocated directly by Meihua Hall.

69
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,199
This Zhou Andao is the most suspicious.

70
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,319
What do you think?

71
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,279
Have a drink.

72
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,160
Let's have the wine later.

73
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,240
I'll go get some water.

74
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,879
My throat is so dry it's almost smoking.

75
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:42,759
Director Lu

76
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,160
We met at the Special Agent Headquarters.

77
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:47,040
I know you.

78
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,680
But you might not know me.

79
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:53,120
Name.

80
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:53,720
Department.

81
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:55,839
Reporting to Director Lu.

82
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:57,040
Confidential Section, Li Daguang.

83
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,680
Li Daguang.

84
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,279
A few days ago, I accompanied Director Zhu from your team.

85
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,399
We went to Dashui Bridge to investigate some leads.

86
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:06,600
Why didn't you show up?

87
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:07,839
That day...

88
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,360
There was something at home that day.

89
00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:12,079
My mother was sick.

90
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:13,000
It's true.

91
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,399
Really.

92
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,560
You know the consequences of lying to me.

93
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,600
I neglected my duty.

94
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:24,160
That day...

95
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,680
I went to Lanxiang Garden.

96
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,319
Director Lu.

97
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:28,360
I swear.

98
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,560
I'm absolutely not lying this time.

99
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:31,560
Who can vouch for you?

100
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,720
The madam at Lanxiang Garden can vouch for me.

101
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:35,040
If you don't believe me, Director Lu,

102
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,240
you can send someone to check right now.

103
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,120
Do you know what I do at No. 76?

104
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:41,120
I know.

105
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:46,959
It won't happen again.

106
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:48,160
It won't happen again.

107
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:46,320
You're here.

108
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:52,440
Let's go.

109
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:18,480
Shanmu.

110
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,639
Something's up.

111
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,039
It's nothing.

112
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:24,039
Yes.

113
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:37,919
Miss Jiang hasn't returned yet.

114
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:40,000
Are we really going to act against Miss Jiang?

115
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:42,159
You heard what the teacher said.

116
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:42,879
But...

117
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:43,879
Orders are absolute.

118
00:09:43,879 --> 00:09:44,799
We can only follow them.

119
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,519
Go inside and wait for now.

120
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:35,759
Team leader

121
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:36,840
It's almost time

122
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:37,919
Should we move in directly?

123
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,480
Wait for my command

124
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:40,320
Without my order

125
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,440
no one is to fire

126
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,200
Yes

127
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:15,320
What are you doing?

128
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,120
Miss Jiang.

129
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,000
Sorry about this.

130
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:18,720
The boss suspects you of colluding with the Communists.

131
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,879
And leaking our information.

132
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,519
We have orders to take you back.

133
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,799
Why didn't Mr. Xie come to see me himself?

134
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:28,600
Come back with us,

135
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:29,879
and you'll see him.

136
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,080
All of you, step aside.

137
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,000
We've worked together for so long.

138
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:43,879
You can't just accuse me of something so serious.

139
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:45,519
For the sake of our past relationship,

140
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:47,480
I think I can explain things to you.

141
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,279
All of you, leave.

142
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,840
Th-this isn't proper, is it?

143
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,200
Follow orders.

144
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:55,120
Get out.

145
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,159
Why?

146
00:12:04,759 --> 00:12:06,440
He never trusted you.

147
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,120
And with a spy's intuition,

148
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,279
it made him suspicious.

149
00:12:11,159 --> 00:12:12,120
You know,

150
00:12:12,519 --> 00:12:13,360
when it comes to the Communists,

151
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,080
he'd rather kill the wrong person than let one go.

152
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:22,840
Jiang,

153
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:25,039
the older, the wiser.

154
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:29,200
What about you?

155
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,399
Do you think I'm one too?

156
00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:33,120
I don't know.

157
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,360
Just slapping a label on someone,

158
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,399
is enough to get them killed.

159
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,799
What has the world come to?

160
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,840
A dignified China,

161
00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:44,559
is already at the brink of life and death.

162
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:46,440
And yet it can't tolerate two different voices.

163
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,480
Why is that?

164
00:12:48,679 --> 00:12:49,399
The urgent task now

165
00:12:49,399 --> 00:12:51,200
should be to unite against the real enemy.

166
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,080
But I'm very grateful

167
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,919
that it's you who came to arrest me.

168
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,000
I'm sorry.

169
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,399
You're just following orders.

170
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,039
There's no need to apologize for him.

171
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:18,960
Go.

172
00:13:21,559 --> 00:13:22,360
What?

173
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:24,080
While they're all outside,

174
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:25,159
leave quickly.

175
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,279
Don't wait for me to change my mind.

176
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,039
Xie Jun'an won't let you go.

177
00:13:30,039 --> 00:13:30,519
You know

178
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:32,399
what methods they'll use against you?

179
00:13:32,919 --> 00:13:35,200
He doesn't care about the consequences anymore.

180
00:13:35,799 --> 00:13:37,320
He hurt Liang Shuo and Lu Xijian,

181
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,720
and so many of my brothers.

182
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,440
Now he won't even spare his own niece.

183
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:45,240
If anything really happens to you,

184
00:13:47,559 --> 00:13:49,399
what reason would I have to keep going?

185
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,960
I know the person you like is Liang Shuo.

186
00:13:54,039 --> 00:13:55,000
It always has been.

187
00:13:55,559 --> 00:13:56,519
I think you've guessed

188
00:13:56,519 --> 00:13:57,519
he's one of us.

189
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,279
But that's not why I'm letting you go.

190
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,639
Putting all feelings aside,

191
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,080
I'm also Chinese.

192
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,080
I can't bear to harm my own people.

193
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,679
If I had another chance to choose,

194
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,200
I would stand by your side without hesitation.

195
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:16,720
And become your comrade, fighting alongside you.

196
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,759
But now, there's no more chance.

197
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:27,919
What do you mean?

198
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,159
Shoot me.

199
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,120
That way, both of us can get out of this.

200
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,519
Xie Jun'an isn't that easy to fool.

201
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:35,279
This is the only way I can think of.

202
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:37,200
Even if he suspects something,

203
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,759
he would never think I'd betray him.

204
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,600
Are you serious?

205
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:43,840
You can't let Xie Jun'an catch you.

206
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,399
Do it for Liang Shuo.

207
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:51,519
With Scorpio's methods,

208
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:54,879
he will definitely have everything planned out.

209
00:14:55,039 --> 00:14:56,399
On my own,

210
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:57,600
there's no way I can escape.

211
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,679
Go to No. 16 Chunhua Road and find Xie Nianzi.

212
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,480
She's under the surveillance of No. 76.

213
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,080
Do you understand what I mean?

214
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,840
Use No. 76 to shake off the pursuers.

215
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:07,879
I'll come to pick you up.

216
00:15:07,879 --> 00:15:08,759
And get you out of here.

217
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:17,840
Go.

218
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,080
I'm sorry.

219
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:25,759
Cheng Chun.

220
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:26,960
I did this of my own will.

221
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,039
It's not your fault.

222
00:15:28,279 --> 00:15:29,080
Hurry, go!

223
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,279
Go!

224
00:15:58,799 --> 00:15:59,279
What's going on?

225
00:15:59,279 --> 00:15:59,879
Where is she?

226
00:16:00,279 --> 00:16:01,440
She shot me.

227
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,360
She lied to me, saying

228
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,200
that after packing up, we'd go see the teacher together.

229
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:10,720
There's a hidden door here.

230
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,399
Hurry, after her!

231
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,080
Where is she?

232
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:22,960
Where did she go?

233
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:24,360
Split up and look for her.

234
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,000
Go!

235
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:35,759
It's been confirmed.

236
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:37,039
Zhou Andao is not the Bone Maggot.

237
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:39,240
He went to Plum Blossom Hall to meet a woman.

238
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:42,200
All suspicions have now been cleared.

239
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:44,759
Could it be that we were heading in the wrong direction from the start?

240
00:16:45,039 --> 00:16:46,559
Let's put ourselves in the Bone Maggot's shoes.

241
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:47,480
Think about it.

242
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,559
He wants to see Mizuno Shingen's heart

243
00:16:49,559 --> 00:16:50,799
even more urgently than we do.

244
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:52,879
So he will definitely show up today.

245
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,720
But at headquarters,

246
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,000
there are over three hundred people.

247
00:16:58,039 --> 00:16:59,039
How do we screen them all?

248
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:00,200
Director Lu.

249
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:03,960
Liang... Director Liang is here too.

250
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:05,000
You two talk.

251
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:06,240
Alright.

252
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:11,000
He's been secretly watching us all along.

253
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:12,920
He knows exactly what we're thinking.

254
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,519
The clue about Zhou Andao came too easily.

255
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,640
It's very likely he set us up on purpose.

256
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,160
Who else could it be?

257
00:17:23,519 --> 00:17:24,559
No matter who he is,

258
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:26,000
he definitely doesn't have the right

259
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,240
to be here at this event.

260
00:17:27,559 --> 00:17:29,640
If someone shows up here inappropriately,

261
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:31,519
then he is the most suspicious.

262
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:38,839
As long as we're fast enough,

263
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,160
we'll make it in time.

264
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,119
Chief.

265
00:17:58,119 --> 00:18:00,200
Most of the people from the Special Agent Headquarters have arrived.

266
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,720
We should head over too.

267
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,240
You, always coming and going like a ghost—

268
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,079
where did you go?

269
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,640
Do I have to report to you even when I go to the restroom?

270
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,000
We couldn't find you anywhere.

271
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,079
Salute.

272
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,559
Old Hu.

273
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:05,759
Everyone,

274
00:19:06,119 --> 00:19:08,480
The Special Operations Headquarters has been established for some time now.

275
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,680
All of your dedication and hard work

276
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,200
have not gone unnoticed by me.

277
00:19:12,599 --> 00:19:14,119
Once again, thank you all.

278
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:25,839
I hope that everyone

279
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:28,400
can unite around the new government in the future

280
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,720
and contribute

281
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,720
to the new order of Greater East Asia.

282
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:32,839
Fortunately,

283
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:33,960
this grand occasion

284
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,319
will soon

285
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:37,599
become a reality before our eyes.

286
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,559
Because of the upcoming Peace Conference,

287
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,519
this is a great era.

288
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:43,240
Everyone is blessed

289
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,960
under the holy light of the East.

290
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,200
But unfortunately,

291
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:48,759
no matter how perfect things are,

292
00:19:48,759 --> 00:19:50,720
there are always some discordant voices.

293
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,480
As the Peace Conference approaches,

294
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:55,720
the assassination attempts by the Chongqing elements

295
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,279
have not ceased.

296
00:19:57,839 --> 00:19:59,680
I have been preoccupied

297
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:01,160
with internal affairs of the organization,

298
00:20:01,319 --> 00:20:03,160
and have somewhat neglected the Special Operations Headquarters.

299
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,400
This has indirectly led to

300
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:07,319
the tragedy of Hirata Kiko.

301
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,839
But now everything is different.

302
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:13,279
Under the leadership of His Majesty the Emperor,

303
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,480
the Imperial Japanese Army

304
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,680
has encountered new opportunities on the battlefield.

305
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,279
The convening of the Peace Conference

306
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:22,440
has brought a new situation to the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.

307
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,319
Even if there are still some among you

308
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:26,200
who are hidden agents I have not eliminated,

309
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,200
I know

310
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:29,240
you are here in the venue,

311
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,920
barely hanging on.

312
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:33,359
Waiting for a chance to sabotage our grand event.

313
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:35,000
But you will soon realize

314
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,480
that everything you do

315
00:20:37,599 --> 00:20:39,400
is in vain.

316
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,400
Because tonight

317
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:43,000
I will prove to you

318
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,400
everything I have said.

319
00:20:46,759 --> 00:20:48,480
Everyone, take a short break.

320
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:49,839
In a little while,

321
00:20:49,839 --> 00:20:51,160
attend the banquet on time.

322
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,559
He came here just to see Mizuno Shingen.

323
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,680
Mizuno Shingen still hasn't

324
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,960
had time to meet him alone yet.

325
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:22,279
We still have a chance.

326
00:22:22,359 --> 00:22:23,160
Let's split up and search.

327
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,880
Mizuno

328
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,839
Looks like I guessed right.

329
00:23:06,359 --> 00:23:08,039
You're the real traitor.

330
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,200
You hid yourself well.

331
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,640
Right back at you.

332
00:23:14,599 --> 00:23:16,279
Before Director Hirata died,

333
00:23:16,519 --> 00:23:19,400
he was still thinking about your little girlfriend.

334
00:23:20,279 --> 00:23:22,359
But she never would have imagined

335
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,680
that it was actually you.

336
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,759
Liang Shuo

337
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,279
Don't move! Don't move!

338
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:47,839
Who are you?

339
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,240
It's a misunderstanding.

340
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,279
I'm one of you.

341
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,359
I'm one of you.

342
00:23:54,119 --> 00:23:55,000
I'm one of you, really.

343
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:57,640
I...

344
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:58,920
I'm from No. 76.

345
00:23:59,000 --> 00:23:59,799
No. 76.

346
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,240
I'm one of you, one of you.

347
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:02,720
No. 76.

348
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:03,799
He's fine.

349
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,039
It's a misunderstanding.

350
00:24:06,039 --> 00:24:07,119
Misunderstanding, misunderstanding, misunderstanding.

351
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:07,839
Misunderstanding.

352
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,200
Aren't you going to explain?

353
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,400
Who exactly are you?

354
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,000
So you really don't remember.

355
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,119
You saved my life.

356
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,160
Comrade Qingshuang

357
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,559
I'm your comrade.

358
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:37,880
Stop!

359
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:38,599
Don't run!

360
00:24:49,079 --> 00:24:49,880
Hurry up and go.

361
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:50,880
Go!

362
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,160
I swear.

363
00:24:55,559 --> 00:24:56,440
I swear.

364
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:58,960
I volunteer to join the Communist Party of China.

365
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,079
I volunteer to join the Communist Party of China.

366
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,079
Ever since you returned from Yulong Mountain,

367
00:25:05,119 --> 00:25:06,480
I noticed something was off with you.

368
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:07,839
If it weren't for

369
00:25:08,319 --> 00:25:09,519
the urgency of this situation,

370
00:25:09,519 --> 00:25:10,480
following your instructions,

371
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,960
I wouldn't have come to meet you.

372
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,079
What else did I ask you to do?

373
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,200
Monitor the Plum Blossom Hall.

374
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:16,359
When I was in the General Affairs Office,

375
00:25:16,359 --> 00:25:17,359
I had access to many

376
00:25:17,359 --> 00:25:19,079
official documents and correspondence with the Plum Blossom Hall.

377
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,880
After I came to your side,

378
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:22,680
I've actually been hinting to you all along.

379
00:25:23,079 --> 00:25:24,640
But there was no response at all.

380
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:28,920
So that's how it is.

381
00:25:34,759 --> 00:25:36,000
We shouldn't stay here long.

382
00:25:36,319 --> 00:25:37,200
You should leave quickly.

383
00:25:37,359 --> 00:25:38,440
Don't expose yourself.

384
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:39,519
Understood.

385
00:25:39,519 --> 00:25:40,440
You be careful too.

386
00:25:56,279 --> 00:25:57,279
You killed Bone Maggot.

387
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:58,079
It was just luck.

388
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,799
I almost got destroyed by him.

389
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:02,240
The banquet is about to start.

390
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:03,559
We can't delay any longer.

391
00:26:08,119 --> 00:26:09,319
We should go to the hospital.

392
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,200
Have you found her?

393
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:10,720
Not yet.

394
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,920
But our people are watching the area.

395
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,119
It shouldn't be easy for her to escape.

396
00:26:13,599 --> 00:26:14,680
She ran northeast.

397
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,319
That's right.

398
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,799
Give me the car keys.

399
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:18,680
No.

400
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,559
You've lost too much blood.

401
00:26:19,559 --> 00:26:20,519
You can't drive like this.

402
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,039
Give them to me.

403
00:26:25,759 --> 00:26:26,839
Go back and tell Scorpio.

404
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:28,160
Jiang Feiman has escaped.

405
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,200
I'll definitely catch her.

406
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,640
You won't last long like this.

407
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,039
Do as I say.

408
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,400
You, go over there.

409
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:45,920
Come with me.

410
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:46,440
Yes.

411
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:12,400
Where is she?

412
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,440
Over there.

413
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,960
It seems to be coming from the intersection.

414
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:22,400
Let's go.

415
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,240
Go down and take a look.

416
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,160
Brothers, move, move, move!

417
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:30,599
Hurry up!

418
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:31,519
This way.

419
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,039
Keep up.

420
00:27:32,039 --> 00:27:32,680
Hurry!

421
00:27:33,839 --> 00:27:34,640
Faster!

422
00:27:43,079 --> 00:27:43,839
Who is it?

423
00:27:57,759 --> 00:27:58,559
Teacher

424
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:00,640
There's another call from Shanghai Station urging us.

425
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,279
They said the meeting point will be signaled by fireworks.

426
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,880
Just keep things low-key.

427
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,160
Why make such a big show of it?

428
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,799
Do you want to attract attention?

429
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:11,039
The students have already asked.

430
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:12,039
Their reply was

431
00:28:12,039 --> 00:28:13,640
The foreigners in the concession have an event tonight.

432
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,079
It will be very lively near the church.

433
00:28:15,079 --> 00:28:16,279
So it won't be too conspicuous.

434
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,240
It's time.

435
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:20,960
Yes.

436
00:28:21,839 --> 00:28:23,200
Since Chengchun can't make it back in time,

437
00:28:23,839 --> 00:28:24,519
let's not wait any longer.

438
00:28:24,519 --> 00:28:25,119
Understood.

439
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,359
Sister Man

440
00:28:53,359 --> 00:28:54,319
Why are you here?

441
00:28:57,119 --> 00:28:57,920
Nian Ci

442
00:28:58,079 --> 00:28:58,880
Come with me.

443
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:00,799
What's wrong?

444
00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:03,920
Those gunshots outside are aimed at you.

445
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,160
There's no time to explain.

446
00:29:08,359 --> 00:29:09,480
Let's talk as we go.

447
00:29:12,279 --> 00:29:13,240
Hurry and change your clothes.

448
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:26,160
Sister Man

449
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,240
What are you doing?

450
00:29:27,759 --> 00:29:28,839
Protecting your safety.

451
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,039
Go.

452
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,519
What's going on?

453
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:42,920
Are the people after you Japanese?

454
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,200
Or are they traitors from Number 76?

455
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,240
I've fallen out with Scorpio.

456
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,200
The ones coming to kill me

457
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,359
are all from the Military Bureau.

458
00:29:48,359 --> 00:29:49,160
How could that be?

459
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,240
They suspect I'm a Communist.

460
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,200
So they know?

461
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,279
They only suspect.

462
00:29:56,039 --> 00:29:57,680
They won't let you go even if it's just suspicion.

463
00:29:58,319 --> 00:30:00,279
I know a place where we can hide from them.

464
00:30:00,279 --> 00:30:01,000
Come with me.

465
00:30:19,799 --> 00:30:20,839
I don't know what's going on.

466
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,119
Be smart.

467
00:30:22,119 --> 00:30:24,000
I feel like something's off today.

468
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,319
Mizuno is here.

469
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,599
Mr. Mizuno

470
00:30:37,799 --> 00:30:39,880
Are you treating all of us like prisoners?

471
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:44,039
Yeah, what do you mean by that?

472
00:30:44,599 --> 00:30:45,680
Everyone, please be quiet.

473
00:30:46,839 --> 00:30:48,400
Everyone, calm down.

474
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,079
Please, everyone, have a seat.

475
00:30:54,759 --> 00:30:56,000
I invited you all here

476
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,440
for a reason, of course.

477
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:00,680
This mansion is not an ordinary residence.

478
00:31:01,079 --> 00:31:02,240
As early as ten years ago,

479
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,839
it was already the largest intelligence agency in Shanghai.

480
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,880
The owner of this house

481
00:31:07,079 --> 00:31:08,519
has already left us.

482
00:31:08,759 --> 00:31:11,160
But he left us a great fortune.

483
00:31:11,799 --> 00:31:13,000
And because of this predecessor,

484
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,759
everything has returned to the starting point.

485
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:19,839
Mr. Mizuno

486
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,240
People are anxious right now.

487
00:31:21,319 --> 00:31:22,279
We still have to trouble you

488
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,480
to clear up everyone's doubts.

489
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,680
That's right, yes.

490
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
There's no other intention.

491
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:29,319
I heard that tonight in the concession

492
00:31:29,319 --> 00:31:30,799
there will be a fireworks show.

493
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,319
So I took the liberty of inviting everyone over.

494
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,799
Everyone, look directly to the west.

495
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,039
Where the fireworks are shining brightly over there

496
00:31:48,079 --> 00:31:49,240
is the old city of Shanghai.

497
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,200
How much longer?

498
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,359
It's just ahead.

499
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,839
Are you two hurt?

500
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,440
How are you?

501
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:05,839
I'm fine.

502
00:33:05,839 --> 00:33:06,480
Let's go, quickly.

503
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,279
Something's not right.

504
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,039
This is the emergency signal from the Shanghai station.

505
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,279
It's only used in very dangerous situations.

506
00:33:20,319 --> 00:33:22,240
I used to work in the communications office at the Shanghai station.

507
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:24,119
At this time,

508
00:33:24,119 --> 00:33:26,039
it's exactly when the teacher is supposed to meet with the Shanghai station.

509
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,640
The teacher was supposed to wait for me to return.

510
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,240
But now he should have already left.

511
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,279
With the teacher's abilities,

512
00:33:30,279 --> 00:33:31,160
he'll be fine.

513
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:31,559
Let's go, quickly.

514
00:33:31,559 --> 00:33:32,559
I'll get you out of here first.

515
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,240
So after all this fuss,

516
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,759
this was Mizuno's plan all along.

517
00:33:46,599 --> 00:33:49,920
How could Chief Mizuno lose his composure over a woman?

518
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,799
Act so out of character?

519
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,319
Is that fitting for someone of his rank?

520
00:33:53,319 --> 00:33:55,400
Uncle, don't you think so?

521
00:33:55,400 --> 00:34:00,119
This could have been a perfect entrapment plan.

522
00:34:00,119 --> 00:34:01,400
Enough.

523
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,640
His recent actions

524
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:07,039
have made me question his motives.

525
00:34:07,559 --> 00:34:10,800
But we're already on his pirate ship.

526
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:13,599
If something goes wrong,

527
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:15,599
if the higher-ups find out, we'll all be in trouble.

528
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,000
No matter what,

529
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,360
you need to cooperate for now.

530
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:22,239
As long as we have the Trinity list,

531
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:24,280
the Chongqing agents in Shanghai

532
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,880
won't be able to escape.

533
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:28,519
Alright, I understand.

534
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:32,880
Impulsiveness is the privilege of the victor.

535
00:34:42,199 --> 00:34:42,920
Sir,

536
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:43,880
everything is ready.

537
00:35:18,159 --> 00:35:20,079
Mizuno Shingen has always been cautious.

538
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,039
During my interactions with him,

539
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:24,920
I've never seen him so confident.

540
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,880
He must be plotting something.

541
00:35:28,039 --> 00:35:29,559
We must be extremely careful.

542
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,039
There are some suspicious points.

543
00:35:32,199 --> 00:35:33,079
What?

544
00:35:33,519 --> 00:35:35,199
At such an important banquet,

545
00:35:35,519 --> 00:35:37,360
where did Takagi Yuyi go?

546
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:41,639
That doesn't make sense.

547
00:35:42,039 --> 00:35:42,760
Think about it.

548
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,239
Where are the fireworks located?

549
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,920
It seems to be in the direction of St. George's Church.

550
00:35:50,119 --> 00:35:51,920
That's one of the Shanghai Station gathering points.

551
00:35:52,159 --> 00:35:53,119
What are you trying to say?

552
00:35:53,679 --> 00:35:55,639
That place is very likely a trap.

553
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
A few days ago,

554
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,320
Nian Ci told me

555
00:35:58,679 --> 00:36:01,039
that she might be cooperating with Shanghai Station's operations soon.

556
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,440
If they act today,

557
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:08,039
is there any way

558
00:36:08,039 --> 00:36:09,480
to get the message out?

559
00:36:11,719 --> 00:36:13,480
The residence has already been sealed off.

560
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,079
Unless we use the phone or radio,

561
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,280
that won't work either.

562
00:36:18,159 --> 00:36:19,239
At this hour,

563
00:36:19,519 --> 00:36:20,559
even if we call,

564
00:36:20,559 --> 00:36:22,079
they won't answer anymore.

565
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:44,280
Look,

566
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,239
I know

567
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:47,239
you understand telegrams and Morse code.

568
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,920
But I want to create

569
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:51,039
a special code just for the two of us.

570
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:51,920
That way,

571
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,039
if you’re ever in danger,

572
00:36:53,079 --> 00:36:54,280
you can immediately

573
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:56,480
contact me in the fastest way.

574
00:36:57,199 --> 00:36:58,039
For example,

575
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,280
retreat,

576
00:37:03,199 --> 00:37:04,000
safe,

577
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:07,639
danger.

578
00:37:12,239 --> 00:37:14,239
If we can turn Morse code

579
00:37:14,239 --> 00:37:15,559
into light signals,

580
00:37:16,039 --> 00:37:17,960
we can alert Nian Ci and Scorpio.

581
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,360
But this place is tightly guarded.

582
00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:23,519
What if we can’t get out?

583
00:37:28,559 --> 00:37:30,280
Shingen Mizuno is also waiting.

584
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:38,800
I’ll go offer a toast in a bit.

585
00:37:39,719 --> 00:37:41,039
You think of a way.

586
00:37:43,639 --> 00:37:44,440
Okay.

587
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:52,840
Mr. Mizuno,

588
00:37:55,519 --> 00:37:56,639
since this is a fine banquet,

589
00:37:56,719 --> 00:37:57,840
there must be good wine.

590
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,519
Right?

591
00:37:59,639 --> 00:38:00,960
Now, Mr. Mizuno,

592
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,840
isn’t it time to invite everyone for a drink?

593
00:38:03,639 --> 00:38:04,760
That’s a great suggestion.

594
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,480
Serve the drinks.

595
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:12,039
They keep running for the sake of their evil deeds

596
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:13,159
and never stop.

597
00:38:13,199 --> 00:38:15,440
They keep running for the sake of their evil deeds

598
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,840
and never stop.

599
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:19,400
What kind of gibberish are they speaking?

600
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,480
Anyone who is greedy for wealth

601
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:24,079
will end up on this path.

602
00:38:24,199 --> 00:38:25,800
will end up on this path.

603
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:26,719
Station chief.

604
00:38:26,719 --> 00:38:28,119
The brothers have all gathered.

605
00:38:28,119 --> 00:38:29,639
They're on their way.

606
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:32,800
It's their endless greed that will destroy them.

607
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:33,559
Come here.

608
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,360
Get all these foreign monks out of here.

609
00:38:37,639 --> 00:38:38,480
Leave the priest.

610
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,000
Understood.

611
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:39,679
Yes, yes.

612
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:42,800
I'll go too.

613
00:38:44,199 --> 00:38:45,159
Everyone, stand up.

614
00:38:45,199 --> 00:38:46,000
I told you to stand up.

615
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:46,639
Didn't you hear me?

616
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:47,679
All of you, stand up.

617
00:38:47,679 --> 00:38:48,239
Hurry up.

618
00:38:48,239 --> 00:38:49,199
Come out.

619
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:49,639
What are you doing?

620
00:38:49,639 --> 00:38:50,280
Hurry up.

621
00:38:50,599 --> 00:38:51,360
Come out!

622
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:52,960
Hurry, stand up.

623
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:53,920
What are you doing?

624
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,119
Hurry, hurry!

625
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:56,719
Shut up.

626
00:38:56,719 --> 00:38:57,320
Move.

627
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,039
Who are you?

628
00:38:58,039 --> 00:38:58,679
Move.

629
00:38:58,840 --> 00:38:59,480
Move.

630
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:00,440
Move.

631
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:01,880
Enough talking.

632
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,000
I know.

633
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,000
Hurry up.

634
00:39:06,119 --> 00:39:06,760
Move.

635
00:39:33,559 --> 00:39:34,400
Everyone,

636
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:35,760
I propose

637
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:38,840
that tonight, with Chief Mizuno's fine food and wine,

638
00:39:39,039 --> 00:39:39,920
we all

639
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,360
raise a toast to Chief Mizuno.

640
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:41,960
What do you think?

641
00:39:42,559 --> 00:39:43,159
Sounds good.

642
00:39:43,159 --> 00:39:44,199
Well said, Brother Liang.

643
00:39:44,559 --> 00:39:45,599
Since this is a banquet,

644
00:39:45,679 --> 00:39:47,079
we should have a festive atmosphere.

645
00:39:47,159 --> 00:39:49,280
Let's all toast Chief Mizuno together.

646
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:49,920
Alright.

647
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,000
Then I'll join you for a drink.

648
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,239
To Chief Mizuno!

649
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:07,480
The power's out!

650
00:40:07,679 --> 00:40:08,559
What's going on?

651
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:09,760
What's happening?

652
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,000
What's wrong? What's happening?

653
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:17,760
What's going on here?

654
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:18,920
Why did the lights go out?

655
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,679
Everyone, don't panic.

656
00:40:31,559 --> 00:40:32,960
Please, don't panic.

657
00:41:04,519 --> 00:41:05,400
Retreat

658
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:16,559
Danger

659
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:35,719
What’s wrong?

660
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,119
Sister Man

661
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:38,719
What is that place?

662
00:41:41,159 --> 00:41:42,440
That’s the riverside lighthouse.

663
00:41:43,199 --> 00:41:44,360
Is there anything unusual?

664
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:45,960
It’s Morse code.

665
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,280
It’s the code I agreed on with Liang Shuo.

666
00:41:52,239 --> 00:41:53,199
What’s the message?

667
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,159
Danger

668
00:41:58,960 --> 00:41:59,760
Retreat

669
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:01,079
Retreat

670
00:42:03,159 --> 00:42:04,119
The teacher is in danger.

671
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:05,960
You get out of the car.

672
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:07,679
I’ll go find him at St. George’s Church.

673
00:42:09,039 --> 00:42:10,039
Okay.

674
00:42:10,039 --> 00:42:11,159
Be careful.
