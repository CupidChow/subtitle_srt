1
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,280
Director Li

2
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,120
Are you in good health?

3
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,199
No problem, no problem.

4
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:48,400
Thank you for your concern.

5
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,120
This is a historic moment.

6
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:04,039
Welcome, everyone.

7
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,840
Let us welcome this new era together.

8
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:09,960
To witness the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity,

9
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:11,360
is our honor.

10
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,039
For the holy war,

11
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:14,759
and for friendship between Japan and China.

12
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:51,360
Welcome.

13
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:52,840
May I rest here for a while?

14
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,639
Please, make yourself comfortable.

15
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:10,159
Sir.

16
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:16,959
Mizuno.

17
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,639
Mr. Mizuno.

18
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,439
You really kept us waiting.

19
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,600
Such a grand gathering.

20
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,360
So many distinguished guests together.

21
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,040
Shanghai, Nanjing.

22
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,759
Talents from all sides.

23
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:28,680
Will soon gather under Mr. Mizuno's banner.

24
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:32,439
This is truly an unprecedented spectacle.

25
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,800
General Nakajima.

26
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,480
You flatter me.

27
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,519
To have the honor of participating in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity affairs

28
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,800
is my privilege.

29
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,480
Please show your identification.

30
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,399
Let's go.

31
00:04:56,439 --> 00:04:57,160
Move.

32
00:04:58,519 --> 00:04:59,279
Chief.

33
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:01,120
It's time.

34
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,639
Everyone, quiet.

35
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,519
After you.

36
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,519
Sir, please.

37
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:32,240
First of all,

38
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,160
thank you all for being here.

39
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,040
It is my honor

40
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:37,759
to witness together with you

41
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:39,600
such a historic moment.

42
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,639
Secondly,

43
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,480
I would like to ask everyone

44
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,800
what is the reason

45
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,560
that has brought us together here?

46
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,839
Among those present,

47
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:50,399
there are high-ranking Chinese officials,

48
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:52,079
and renowned generals from the Empire.

49
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,519
We come from two different countries,

50
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,879
yet for the same goal,

51
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:00,360
we have gathered here.

52
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,120
For peace.

53
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:03,920
This is something that

54
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:05,439
no previous grand event

55
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,279
has ever witnessed before.

56
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,240
Whether it is China,

57
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:15,560
or Asia as a whole,

58
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:16,720
in modern times,

59
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,759
have all suffered too much hardship.

60
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:20,480
We are gathered here

61
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,839
to unite,

62
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,040
to support each other,

63
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:24,160
and to establish

64
00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:26,319
cooperation in politics, economics, and culture,

65
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:27,199
for mutual prosperity.

66
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,319
Today, we have

67
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,360
many journalists present,

68
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:39,279
as well as many international friends.

69
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,800
All journalists are welcome to ask questions.

70
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,319
Does anyone have any questions?

71
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:47,839
Mr. Mizuno

72
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:50,360
The theme of this meeting is peace.

73
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,199
May I ask if you will truly

74
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:55,279
strive to maintain order in East Asia?

75
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,160
Of course.

76
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,879
Through our tireless efforts,

77
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,079
the Japanese government,

78
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,160
Manchukuo,

79
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,680
and the Nanjing government

80
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:05,959
have developed good relations.

81
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:08,199
Japan was once preoccupied with

82
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:09,360
the Manchurian Incident.

83
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:11,920
Now we are in the midst of the China Incident.

84
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:13,240
Among the countries in the East,

85
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,720
only Japan

86
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:15,759
has the capability

87
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,199
to carry out this mission.

88
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:21,199
Then why does this land

89
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:22,600
still suffer from ongoing war?

90
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,680
When will the war end?

91
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:26,480
It will end soon.

92
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:28,600
But what I want to clarify is

93
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,920
that what we are doing is not war,

94
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:33,480
but rather the remolding of this country's morals

95
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:34,480
and reconstruction,

96
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:35,519
restoring

97
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:37,360
the dignity of the Asian people.

98
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:39,240
Ladies and gentlemen,

99
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,399
This is a campaign led by Japan.

100
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:45,199
In Mr. Mizuno's view,

101
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,639
torture,

102
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:47,480
massacre,

103
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,279
rape,

104
00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:49,040
famine,

105
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:51,199
are all essential conditions for a holy war.

106
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,240
From 1937 until now,

107
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:54,759
Japan has committed

108
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:56,360
heinous war crimes in China.

109
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,240
Civilian casualties alone have exceeded six million.

110
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:01,439
Do you think a simple rephrasing from you

111
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:03,560
can cover all of this up?

112
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,720
Which newspaper are you a reporter for?

113
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08,160
We uphold the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.

114
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,000
Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere?

115
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,600
How is it co-prosperity?

116
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,680
From Manchukuo

117
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,879
to the Wang puppet regime,

118
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,600
what your country has implemented in China

119
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,399
is a strategy of encroachment and partition.

120
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:18,600
Enslavement education,

121
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,079
glorification of war,

122
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,399
cultural invasion,

123
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:22,759
and supporting puppets.

124
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:25,839
Your malicious intent is obvious to all.

125
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:26,720
During the war,

126
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,040
you massacred civilians,

127
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,120
raped women,

128
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,959
like uncivilized beasts.

129
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,000
You plundered resources everywhere,

130
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,080
and laborers,

131
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,600
like blood-sucking parasites.

132
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:36,360
It's Liang Shuo.

133
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,759
You divide people into classes.

134
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,000
You conduct biological experiments in war zones.

135
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:43,120
You rule through enslavement.

136
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:44,840
The so-called Yamato people—

137
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,200
are nothing more than a group of

138
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,919
human-skinned beasts, pirates, and Japanese lackeys.

139
00:08:49,639 --> 00:08:50,679
Bastards.

140
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,080
Who is this person?

141
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:52,759
Get out!

142
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:54,440
Soldiers, arrest him.

143
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:55,360
Arrest him.

144
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,600
Even if you arrest me,

145
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,279
you still can't cover up

146
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:58,840
the crimes you've committed in China.

147
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:01,320
Take him away.

148
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:02,879
Chief.

149
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,240
Seal off the scene and search the area.

150
00:09:05,639 --> 00:09:07,679
Find out if there are any accomplices.

151
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:08,240
Yes, sir.

152
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,080
Stop filming.

153
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,120
Director Liang.

154
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,840
Out of habit,

155
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,440
I still call you Director Liang.

156
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:37,159
I never thought our story

157
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,200
would end like this.

158
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:47,600
Chief, you really are sentimental.

159
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:49,879
Chief.

160
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,559
About what happened today,

161
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:07,240
I hope Director Liang can clarify things.

162
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:10,200
You barged in here all by yourself—

163
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:12,360
did you not consider the consequences?

164
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,679
Didn't the Chief already send people to investigate?

165
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:24,799
I really didn't expect

166
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,840
you could do something like this.

167
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,679
So reckless,

168
00:10:28,679 --> 00:10:29,960
without considering the consequences.

169
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,000
So naive and childish.

170
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:36,440
Living has lost all meaning.

171
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,399
My family

172
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:39,240
and friends

173
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,039
have all died at your hands.

174
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:44,000
The truth is finally revealed.

175
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:45,799
Now it's just a fight to the death.

176
00:10:47,799 --> 00:10:49,320
Every move in our confrontation

177
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,279
and every decision you made

178
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,799
carried special meaning.

179
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,639
Then I'll tell the chief

180
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,080
that my target

181
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,639
is the Peace Conference.

182
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,799
A fish on the chopping board

183
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,720
can't make much of a splash anymore.

184
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,519
I have already checked all the attendees.

185
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:26,600
Except for him,

186
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,159
no one else has infiltrated.

187
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:31,360
I believe Liang Shuo knows the situation is hopeless.

188
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,320
He can no longer pose

189
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,600
any real threat to the conference.

190
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,159
That's why he took such a desperate risk.

191
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,399
He hopes to use Western media

192
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:38,000
to slander our Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity.

193
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,559
It's truly a childish act.

194
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,720
At this point,

195
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,360
he can only gamble with his life.

196
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,000
But he is still a member of the Special Investigation Division.

197
00:11:45,159 --> 00:11:47,080
He knows our venue layout well.

198
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,039
But we've also conducted a thorough search.

199
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:49,799
There's absolutely no way

200
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:52,159
any explosives could have been brought into the venue.

201
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,480
Bombs.

202
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,279
It must be that batch of bombs from Yan Jiu.

203
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,600
We can't just search inside the venue.

204
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,759
Search within a two-kilometer radius of the venue.

205
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:04,960
I want a full sweep.

206
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,360
Also, more attendees will be arriving soon.

207
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:08,919
Tonight's secret meeting

208
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:10,759
must not have any more mishaps.

209
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:11,960
Yes, sir.

210
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:12,919
Wait.

211
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:15,720
Yes.

212
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,600
Could this be an enemy trap?

213
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,120
Right now,

214
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,759
all our attention is on the Peace Conference.

215
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,039
Chief,

216
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,639
the special train carrying Nanjing officials

217
00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:34,159
will

218
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,120
arrive in about fifteen minutes.

219
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,159
It's about to enter the station.

220
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:38,360
The train...

221
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:44,000
The enemy has changed their target.

222
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:45,399
The train.

223
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:03,000
Leave now and come with me to the station.

224
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:04,080
Yes, sir.

225
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,320
You understand too, right?

226
00:13:08,919 --> 00:13:09,320
Understood.

227
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,080
Let's go to the station.

228
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:11,440
Okay.

229
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,240
Gather up.

230
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:15,000
Gather up.

231
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:19,679
Move quickly.

232
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:21,559
Head to the station.

233
00:13:21,559 --> 00:13:22,360
Get in the car.

234
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,440
Hurry.

235
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:25,559
Hurry.

236
00:13:59,559 --> 00:14:00,120
Sir

237
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,120
We're ready.

238
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:12,679
They're coming.

239
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:13,879
Get ready.

240
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,639
Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity

241
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:28,559
Detonate.

242
00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:54,399
Line up to welcome them! Line up to welcome them!

243
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:55,279
Hurry!

244
00:14:56,559 --> 00:14:57,519
Quickly!

245
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:02,720
Chief

246
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:03,879
Tianxu

247
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:04,639
Tianxu

248
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,120
It's been blown up!

249
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:07,480
Stay calm.

250
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:10,399
Liang Shuo definitely knows everything.

251
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:12,960
They lured us away from the venue.

252
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,320
What exactly do the Communists want?

253
00:15:17,799 --> 00:15:19,120
Do you have a map of this area?

254
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:19,679
Yes.

255
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,720
All our efforts are wasted.

256
00:15:23,559 --> 00:15:25,000
This is a complete mess.

257
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:27,279
I didn't expect this.

258
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:29,159
Liang Shuo and the Communists

259
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:32,120
could actually stir up such a storm.

260
00:15:34,279 --> 00:15:36,039
This peace conference

261
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,399
has been completely ruined.

262
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,600
Director

263
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:44,720
You don't look well.

264
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,480
Do you want to go back and rest for a bit?

265
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,279
It's just that

266
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,919
I haven't rested well these past few days.

267
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:52,000
Here

268
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,519
is too stuffy.

269
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,240
Let's go.

270
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,759
Let's go out for a walk too.

271
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:57,639
Okay.

272
00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:01,320
Director

273
00:16:09,159 --> 00:16:11,080
Director, Director

274
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,120
Director

275
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:12,919
What's wrong with you?

276
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,000
Director

277
00:16:16,039 --> 00:16:16,559
Come

278
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:18,440
Welcome, everyone

279
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:29,519
Please enjoy your meal, everyone

280
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:33,679
Director Li

281
00:16:34,279 --> 00:16:34,720
Please

282
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:35,799
Alright

283
00:16:36,039 --> 00:16:36,519
Okay

284
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,200
Director Li

285
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:48,720
Go ahead and eat

286
00:16:48,919 --> 00:16:49,360
Alright

287
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:49,799
Eat

288
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:50,679
Eat

289
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:08,240
The Japanese want to kill me

290
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:10,880
Mizuno

291
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:12,359
poisoned me

292
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:15,400
Director

293
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,319
When the cunning rabbit dies

294
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,279
Go

295
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,240
the hunting dog

296
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:22,799
is cooked

297
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:25,480
Director

298
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:26,920
Director

299
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:31,759
Director

300
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,440
Five o'clock tomorrow morning

301
00:17:43,759 --> 00:17:44,559
Qingfeng Teahouse

302
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:45,240
I'll wait for you

303
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,440
Old Tan

304
00:17:49,119 --> 00:17:51,440
Can we take one more chance?

305
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,839
There's only one step left in the Qianyuan Plan

306
00:17:57,599 --> 00:17:58,880
From the diary

307
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:01,200
I found the already gathered

308
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,480
Japanese troop deployment

309
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,720
And this key

310
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,720
The Military Bureau has already moved the explosives to

311
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:09,319
the printing and dyeing factory on Yuyuan Road

312
00:18:10,279 --> 00:18:11,400
I have an idea

313
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:13,000
Go ahead

314
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,319
Lure the snake out of its hole

315
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:21,359
Once the Peace Conference is held

316
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,319
the puppet government in Nanjing

317
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:24,400
will send key officials to Shanghai

318
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Given Wang Jingwei's cautiousness

319
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:29,599
he will definitely send a special train

320
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:32,640
You want to

321
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,599
blow up the special train

322
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:46,519
I have important information

323
00:18:53,319 --> 00:18:54,240
What are you doing?

324
00:18:55,279 --> 00:18:56,599
Come here

325
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,599
I'll only tell you

326
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:05,799
What are you afraid of?

327
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,640
Please rest assured, Chief.

328
00:19:42,839 --> 00:19:43,960
This place is heavily guarded.

329
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:46,440
Security at the venue has also been reinforced.

330
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,519
The safety of the attendees is fully guaranteed.

331
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,160
Qingshan Detention Center.

332
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,599
There aren't any important people there.

333
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:58,960
The guards stationed there—

334
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,720
Have they all been transferred here?

335
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:03,000
That's correct.

336
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:04,160
You still don't get it.

337
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:07,240
The enemy's real target is Qingshan Detention Center.

338
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,759
Gather the troops and head there immediately.

339
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,000
We'll rendezvous at Qingshan Detention Center.

340
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,039
Yes, sir.

341
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:16,240
Assemble!

342
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:19,799
Liang Shuo.

343
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:22,880
You can't escape.

344
00:21:15,079 --> 00:21:16,319
Fellow workers,

345
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,119
Everyone, charge out with me!

346
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,200
Charge!

347
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,359
Retreat to the west!

348
00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:38,400
There’s support waiting for us.

349
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:39,240
Liang Shuo,

350
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:39,960
There are too many people.

351
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:40,880
I can’t hear anything at all.

352
00:21:44,039 --> 00:21:45,039
I’ll go to the broadcast room.

353
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:46,119
You lead them to retreat first.

354
00:21:46,119 --> 00:21:47,319
I’ll hold off Mizuno Shingen.

355
00:21:47,319 --> 00:21:49,680
I still have a score to settle with him.

356
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,440
Okay.

357
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,480
Comrades,

358
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,599
Retreat with me!

359
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,200
Comrades,

360
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,559
Retreat to the west!

361
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:09,720
There’s support waiting for us.

362
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:11,720
Comrades,

363
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:13,839
Retreat to the west!

364
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,079
There’s support waiting for us.

365
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:17,119
Comrades,

366
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,680
There’s support waiting for us.

367
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:19,720
Follow me!

368
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,920
Charge!

369
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,200
Charge!

370
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:14,960
Hurry up, keep up!

371
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,119
Chief

372
00:23:56,319 --> 00:23:56,920
Reporting to the Chief

373
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:59,000
The group of laborers broke through the defense line

374
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,119
and are fleeing to the west

375
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,079
Don't let a single one escape

376
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:02,720
Bring them all back to me

377
00:24:02,839 --> 00:24:03,319
Yes, sir

378
00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:06,640
Mizuno

379
00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:09,279
You're already too late

380
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:12,640
Chief

381
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:13,680
That voice is Liang Shuo

382
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:14,880
I recognized it

383
00:24:15,519 --> 00:24:16,519
Bring him out for me

384
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:17,400
Yes, sir

385
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,079
Move out

386
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:20,880
Hurry

387
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:22,839
Break in

388
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,079
Liang Shuo

389
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:26,240
I know you're here

390
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,240
I didn't expect you to be so foolish

391
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,079
Are you staying here to die?

392
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,839
Do you think

393
00:24:33,559 --> 00:24:34,960
that by stalling for a little time

394
00:24:35,359 --> 00:24:37,519
you can save the laborers here?

395
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:39,759
Mizuno

396
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,519
I'm staying here

397
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:44,359
just to catch up with an old friend

398
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:48,160
Don't you want to hear me recap

399
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,440
what happened at the peace conference?

400
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:53,000
Stop wasting time

401
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:54,960
It's all in vain

402
00:24:55,519 --> 00:24:56,799
As long as the 3-1 list

403
00:24:57,119 --> 00:24:58,000
is in my hands

404
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,799
you'll all die sooner or later

405
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,200
Chief

406
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,720
All the lists

407
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,119
are in here.

408
00:25:22,279 --> 00:25:23,839
We risked our lives for this.

409
00:25:23,839 --> 00:25:24,559
Take it.

410
00:25:26,279 --> 00:25:27,799
Is this the complete list?

411
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,160
It's a pity he didn't have time to photograph everything.

412
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,759
This is enough.

413
00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:33,559
As long as we have these traitors

414
00:25:33,559 --> 00:25:34,799
and the names of the Japanese spies,

415
00:25:35,319 --> 00:25:37,119
we can root them all out.

416
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:42,119
Mizuno.

417
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:44,880
You must have seen it.

418
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:47,599
As long as I have the negatives,

419
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,960
your list

420
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,200
is worthless.

421
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,119
Liang Shuo!

422
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,599
Come out right now!

423
00:25:58,039 --> 00:25:59,839
We need to settle this score.

424
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,079
Let's go.

425
00:26:26,119 --> 00:26:27,039
Keep searching.

426
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:28,119
Search carefully.

427
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,039
No one is here.

428
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:32,319
Keep looking.

429
00:26:32,319 --> 00:26:32,720
Yes.

430
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:50,759
Kick it open.

431
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:02,920
It's a trap!

432
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,200
Just a little bit short

433
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,599
This must be fate

434
00:28:19,599 --> 00:28:20,680
For me

435
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:22,920
What a pity

436
00:28:23,359 --> 00:28:25,279
I refuse to accept my fate

437
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:10,559
Hand over the film, now.

438
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,640
Or I'll send you to your grave right now.

439
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:14,759
You want it?

440
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:15,920
I'll give it to you.

441
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,480
Let go.

442
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,440
The crimes you've committed in China

443
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,200
have finally caught up with you.

444
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,279
Do you still remember

445
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:36,000
what I once told you?

446
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,440
Life is not just about mere survival,

447
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,480
but about seeking light and forging the soul.

448
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,640
We are determined to pass on the torch.

449
00:30:42,119 --> 00:30:43,000
Every breath

450
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,319
is for our faith.

451
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:45,200
Every step

452
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:46,759
is for progress.

453
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,319
We should use

454
00:30:48,519 --> 00:30:50,000
our original aspiration to light the way ahead,

455
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,160
with our mission

456
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:52,240
to forge our character,

457
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,480
and with resilience

458
00:30:54,119 --> 00:30:55,200
to seek the light.

459
00:31:31,799 --> 00:31:32,640
Uncle Yan

460
00:31:33,319 --> 00:31:34,440
Did you see that?

461
00:31:35,319 --> 00:31:37,000
The Qianyuan mission is complete.

462
00:31:37,799 --> 00:31:39,000
What I promised you

463
00:31:39,799 --> 00:31:40,759
I have done it.

464
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,079
Sir

465
00:32:08,079 --> 00:32:08,839
They've arrived.

466
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,279
Mr. Tan

467
00:32:14,279 --> 00:32:15,240
Comrade Siming

468
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,039
Finally, I get to meet you.

469
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:17,720
Yes.

470
00:32:18,119 --> 00:32:19,359
Finally, I get to meet you.

471
00:32:19,839 --> 00:32:21,039
Is there any difficulty with the evacuation?

472
00:32:21,359 --> 00:32:22,160
Don't worry.

473
00:32:22,319 --> 00:32:23,799
We divided the refugees from the shelter

474
00:32:23,799 --> 00:32:25,160
into forty small groups

475
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,160
to break them up into smaller units.

476
00:32:26,599 --> 00:32:27,440
In an orderly manner, according to

477
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,359
the evacuation plan you provided.

478
00:32:29,359 --> 00:32:31,880
They'll leave in batches from Hangzhou, Suzhou, Huzhou

479
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,079
and Jiaxing.

480
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:33,640
Good.

481
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:34,319
The guerrilla team

482
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,440
has already set out to provide support.

483
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,559
I believe everything will go smoothly from now on.

484
00:32:37,559 --> 00:32:38,119
Good.

485
00:32:38,279 --> 00:32:39,039
That's great.

486
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:40,960
Old Tan

487
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:42,839
Old Tan

488
00:32:53,319 --> 00:32:54,279
Since we parted in Guangzhou

489
00:32:54,759 --> 00:32:55,599
I never expected

490
00:32:55,759 --> 00:32:57,319
we would meet again like this.

491
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,039
Yes.

492
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,039
You suffered in the labor camp.

493
00:33:01,319 --> 00:33:02,519
It must have been hard for you.

494
00:33:03,319 --> 00:33:04,160
Seeing you

495
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,920
means our Deep Abyss plan

496
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,720
is finally complete.

497
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,119
I suppose this counts as

498
00:33:10,119 --> 00:33:11,559
going deep behind enemy lines.

499
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,799
It fits the needs of our struggle against the enemy.

500
00:33:14,079 --> 00:33:15,400
I have to thank all of you.

501
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,519
If it weren't for your timely rescue,

502
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,039
By the way,

503
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,640
what about the comrade who saved us?

504
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,480
Secretary.

505
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:32,400
Secretary.

506
00:33:32,599 --> 00:33:33,200
Slow down.

507
00:33:33,319 --> 00:33:33,920
What's the matter?

508
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,000
Why are you in such a rush?

509
00:33:35,359 --> 00:33:37,079
This is an urgent document escorted from Shanghai.

510
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:51,839
Alright.

511
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:56,519
Connect me to the chief.

512
00:33:59,359 --> 00:34:00,799
Our intelligence work in Shanghai

513
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,480
has made comprehensive progress.

514
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,799
It's been highly effective.

515
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,320
The rescue operation at the labor camp

516
00:34:08,559 --> 00:34:09,480
was also a success.

517
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:10,960
Yes.

518
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,679
It was achieved through the sacrifice of many comrades.

519
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:14,679
That's the price we paid.

520
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:16,440
We will not forget them.

521
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:18,559
Alright.

522
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:19,719
This document

523
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:21,280
I'll deliver it to you right away.

524
00:35:25,239 --> 00:35:25,760
General

525
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:27,599
The military representative has arrived.

526
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,920
Shall we start the meeting now?

527
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:32,639
Let's go, then.

528
00:35:33,039 --> 00:35:33,679
Yes, sir.

529
00:35:53,039 --> 00:35:55,000
Extra! Extra!

530
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:58,360
Anti-Japanese forces attack the Peace Conference venue.

531
00:35:58,639 --> 00:36:01,719
Many officials of the new government have tragically died.

532
00:36:01,719 --> 00:36:02,559
Extra! Extra!

533
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,800
Come, buy a newspaper!

534
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,239
Thank you.

535
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:12,639
Anti-Japanese forces attack the Peace Conference site.

536
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,760
Several new government officials have tragically died.

537
00:36:16,159 --> 00:36:19,199
The Communist Party of China launches a campaign against Wang.

538
00:36:19,519 --> 00:36:21,480
Extra! Extra!

539
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,360
Anti-Japanese forces attack the Peace Conference site.

540
00:36:34,039 --> 00:36:34,880
This

541
00:36:35,719 --> 00:36:37,039
is what Mizuno Shingen referred to

542
00:36:37,039 --> 00:36:38,480
as invaluable intelligence.

543
00:36:38,599 --> 00:36:41,360
It's a weapon that can influence the outcome of the Sino-Japanese war.

544
00:36:41,639 --> 00:36:43,320
Don't think that just because Mizuno Shingen is dead

545
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:44,599
there is no responsibility left.

546
00:36:44,599 --> 00:36:45,519
It was because we trusted your

547
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,480
so-called intelligence

548
00:36:49,639 --> 00:36:51,840
that our military operations around Changsha

549
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,840
suffered a defeat.

550
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:56,199
An entire army brigade was wiped out.

551
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,159
Takagi Shiba,

552
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,719
you are directly responsible for this.

553
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:00,440
General Takagi,

554
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,760
the list you provided

555
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:02,920
had major flaws.

556
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:05,119
Of the twenty-nine agents we sent to make contact,

557
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:06,559
not a single one returned.

558
00:37:06,559 --> 00:37:08,639
These were all elite agents carefully trained by the Empire.

559
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,119
I need an explanation.

560
00:37:10,119 --> 00:37:11,400
Chongqing has already taken action.

561
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,719
They have purged a large number of government officials.

562
00:37:12,719 --> 00:37:14,800
The Chongqing government has also

563
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,360
reestablished cooperation with the Communists.

564
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:20,320
I think your so-called secret list

565
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,239
was leaked long ago.

566
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,199
General Takagi,

567
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:25,440
you must pay the price for your stupidity.

568
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,920
Go and apologize to the Emperor.

569
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:35,760
General,

570
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,840
someone from the Army Department is here.

571
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,679
They are here to escort you to the Military Police Headquarters.

572
00:37:41,159 --> 00:37:42,480
Tell them to wait.

573
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,760
Should I tell them to wait a moment, is that alright?

574
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,840
Do as I say.

575
00:37:48,039 --> 00:37:48,760
Leave.

576
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,320
Yes, sir.

577
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:22,920
Comrade, please come inside.

578
00:38:23,239 --> 00:38:24,079
Comrade Xiao Zhang is back.

579
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:24,840
He's back.

580
00:38:25,079 --> 00:38:26,239
Comrade, inside.

581
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,039
Xiao Zhang is back.

582
00:38:29,039 --> 00:38:29,800
He's back.

583
00:38:30,119 --> 00:38:30,840
Comrade.

584
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:31,639
Sister Liu.

585
00:38:31,639 --> 00:38:32,679
I've brought the person.

586
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:33,360
What's wrong?

587
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:34,280
Comrade.

588
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:34,880
What's wrong?

589
00:38:35,039 --> 00:38:35,840
I've brought the person.

590
00:38:38,559 --> 00:38:39,800
Are you Xie Nianci's family?

591
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:40,960
Please come inside, please come inside.

592
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,079
The person is inside.

593
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:43,519
Xiao Zhang, come here, come here.

594
00:38:43,519 --> 00:38:44,519
Help me with something, quick.

595
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,320
Nian Ci

596
00:39:45,079 --> 00:39:46,280
Wake up quickly.

597
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,880
There's still a long way to go.

598
00:39:50,599 --> 00:39:51,679
Let's walk it together.

599
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,199
Still no news?

600
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,400
By my calculations, he should be arriving soon.

601
00:40:50,039 --> 00:40:50,840
Sir,

602
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,320
Who is this comrade, exactly?

603
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,360
You seem to value him a lot.

604
00:40:55,559 --> 00:40:56,239
Sorry.

605
00:40:56,239 --> 00:40:56,920
I spoke out of turn.

606
00:40:57,119 --> 00:40:58,599
Did I break the rules?

607
00:40:59,079 --> 00:41:00,159
When he arrives,

608
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,559
you'll find out.
