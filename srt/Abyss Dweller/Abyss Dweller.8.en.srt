1
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:11,800
Long time no see.

2
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,680
Shadow.

3
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,080
Seeing that you’re doing well

4
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:30,919
puts my mind at ease.

5
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,039
You are

6
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:37,919
Scorpio

7
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:40,680
Could it be

8
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:42,840
Shouldn't you call me "teacher"?

9
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,080
So I belong to you

10
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:49,199
I'm with the Military Bureau

11
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:51,240
Of course

12
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,479
You are my best student

13
00:02:56,439 --> 00:02:57,120
How is it?

14
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,319
Did you make contact with Yan Jiu?

15
00:02:58,439 --> 00:02:59,599
Did you get the key?

16
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,319
Did you figure it out?

17
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,280
Where is the explosive hidden?

18
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:05,199
Why

19
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:07,319
Why what?

20
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:11,039
Why did you send me on this kind of mission?

21
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:13,520
I know

22
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:16,080
His death is related to you

23
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:18,719
A mission is a mission

24
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,719
We never ask why when carrying out a mission

25
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,120
It's like using a pistol

26
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,479
Sending a bullet into the enemy's head

27
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,759
All you need to do is pull the trigger

28
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:29,240
Your mission

29
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,759
is to get the explosive

30
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:32,280
Where is the explosive?

31
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,520
You know very well he's my uncle

32
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:39,240
He raised me and is my benefactor

33
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:41,000
I'm asking you, where is the explosive?

34
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:42,639
Answer me

35
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:45,639
Otherwise, you'll never get the explosive in this lifetime

36
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:49,680
It seems you really don't remember anything

37
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,199
His death

38
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:53,560
was destined from the moment he was captured

39
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:57,159
No one could change this outcome

40
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,680
He was also an old acquaintance of mine

41
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,520
I know you're in a lot of pain right now

42
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:06,840
But now is not the time for pain

43
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,240
I clearly had a chance to save him

44
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:13,639
But because of that person

45
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:18,040
Those who achieve great things

46
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,240
must never be soft-hearted or hesitant.

47
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,639
I was worried about you.

48
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,319
That you might hesitate at a critical moment.

49
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,360
That's why I sent someone to support you.

50
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,399
Don't tell me

51
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,199
that even so,

52
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:33,040
you still failed to complete the mission.

53
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,560
Gong Biao.

54
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,560
Are you crazy?

55
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,680
Speak.

56
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:04,680
Who sent you?

57
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,120
So that person,

58
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,519
that Gong Biao,

59
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:15,199
is your man.

60
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,240
He was one of my early students.

61
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,319
That's right.

62
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,120
At least he didn't let me down.

63
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:28,600
Let me guess.

64
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,959
The reason No. 76 let you go

65
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,720
is because they figured out

66
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:37,240
that the person who killed Yan Jiu

67
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,240
was you, right?

68
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,920
If you hadn't taken advantage of

69
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:16,600
Yan Jiu's trade route to transport explosives,

70
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:18,839
he wouldn't have died.

71
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:21,079
From Manchuria to Shanghai,

72
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:23,680
you had plenty of chances to save him.

73
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,240
All dangerous operations

74
00:06:27,079 --> 00:06:28,959
can only be paid for with lives.

75
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,160
We have to consider the price we have to bear.

76
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:35,040
Besides, the Japanese are already suspicious of you.

77
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,120
If Yan Jiu hadn't died,

78
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,279
you would never be completely safe.

79
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,319
Originally

80
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,959
I was still very worried

81
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:46,759
that you hurt your head

82
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,720
But now it seems

83
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:50,680
it's alright

84
00:06:51,399 --> 00:06:53,439
You can still remember quite a lot

85
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,279
Go ahead, speak

86
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:56,839
The explosives

87
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,120
Where are they hidden?

88
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,800
The key Yan Jiu left behind

89
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,279
Where is it?

90
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,600
The explosives

91
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,079
The key

92
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,399
That's all you care about

93
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,360
This is the most important thing right now

94
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,680
All of us

95
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:15,319
are waiting for this outcome

96
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,560
You don't care about his life at all

97
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,240
Why should I risk my life for someone like you?

98
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,160
Worldly notions of right and wrong will only cloud your judgment

99
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:30,079
What you can imagine

100
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,240
If he confesses

101
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,360
all our plans

102
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,319
will be ruined

103
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,920
No matter who it is

104
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,439
sacrificing for the greater good of the country

105
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:42,680
is always worth it

106
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,519
The greater good is not about sacrificing others

107
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,480
What right do you have

108
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,920
to decide someone else's fate?

109
00:07:54,439 --> 00:07:55,360
Don't kill him.

110
00:07:55,879 --> 00:07:58,199
Looks like you've been at No. 76 for too long.

111
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:00,360
You've lost all your spirit.

112
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:03,160
You must always remember,

113
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:04,759
you are the shadow of the Military Bureau.

114
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:06,639
The interests of the Party and the nation are above all else.

115
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,480
After being away for a while,

116
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:12,879
you feel much more unfamiliar to me.

117
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:14,279
Or is it you

118
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,720
who couldn't withstand the torture at No. 76

119
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,120
and betrayed us?

120
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:19,800
Teacher.

121
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,800
Think twice.

122
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:24,319
Kneel.

123
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,639
Chief

124
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:45,320
We've found the car used to kidnap Director Liang

125
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,240
and the one Captain Motoki rode in.

126
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,519
Alright.

127
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,320
How confident are you that we can catch them all at once?

128
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,360
If we surround them from two directions based on the terrain,

129
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,799
none of them will escape.

130
00:08:56,279 --> 00:08:58,320
What about Director Liang and the others?

131
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,559
As long as we catch Scorpio,

132
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:05,840
the others' lives don't matter.

133
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:09,919
Now the tables have turned.

134
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,799
Let me tell you,

135
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,879
if I ever betray you,

136
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:16,600
you'll be the first one I kill.

137
00:09:18,919 --> 00:09:20,399
Let me go.

138
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:24,919
From now on,

139
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,200
we'll have nothing to do with each other.

140
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,159
Fine.

141
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:33,759
That's my student.

142
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,279
Liang Shuo.

143
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:38,000
The Snow Blind Plan.

144
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,080
You joined it of your own free will.

145
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,200
If you can't break out of it,

146
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:43,919
do you really think

147
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,000
you can just walk away so easily

148
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,840
without any consequences?

149
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,039
Snow Blind.

150
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,960
The Snow Blind Plan uses Yan Jiu's trade route

151
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:59,759
to secretly transport a batch of powerful explosives to Shanghai.

152
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:03,399
Then, using your identity to gain the Japanese's trust.

153
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:06,159
At the right time, use them to blow up the Peace Conference.

154
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:08,519
Operation codename: Snow Blind.

155
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:18,919
Miss

156
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:19,639
What are you doing?

157
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:20,879
Let him go.

158
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,519
Have you forgotten

159
00:10:24,759 --> 00:10:26,240
I taught you all of this.

160
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,039
Once you join our organization,

161
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,200
if you want to leave,

162
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,360
the only way out is in a coffin.

163
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,120
No one walks out alive.

164
00:10:33,879 --> 00:10:35,519
I gave you a chance.

165
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:37,279
You didn't take it.

166
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,159
If you want to blame someone, blame yourself.

167
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:09,879
Why don't you just kill me?

168
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:11,480
Dying is easy.

169
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,639
Dying for a cause is what's hard.

170
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:17,600
The Japanese peace conference

171
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,759
is about to begin.

172
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:20,120
Everyone's efforts

173
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,639
are resting on your shoulders.

174
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,000
But look at you now.

175
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:26,799
Can you face those who sacrificed themselves?

176
00:11:27,799 --> 00:11:29,240
Can you face Yan Jiu?

177
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,679
Wake up.

178
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,120
It was the Japanese who killed Yan Jiu.

179
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:38,799
Even if he survived Yulong Mountain,

180
00:11:38,919 --> 00:11:40,600
could he have escaped from the Japanese

181
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:42,720
from Cell 76

182
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:44,240
and walked out alive?

183
00:11:44,919 --> 00:11:46,720
If you want revenge, go after the Japanese.

184
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,600
Carry out the Snow Blind plan.

185
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:50,279
Don't let our brothers' blood be shed in vain.

186
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:52,960
Tell me,

187
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,480
where is the dynamite?

188
00:11:57,039 --> 00:12:00,399
What gives you the right to decide someone's fate?

189
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:03,559
Let me tell you,

190
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:04,759
Scorpion,

191
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,279
I won't just follow your expectations

192
00:12:08,039 --> 00:12:09,720
to decide my own path.

193
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:13,519
I'll do it my way

194
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,039
to avenge him.

195
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:22,919
Sir

196
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:24,960
Sir

197
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:25,840
The military police are here

198
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,000
We’re surrounded

199
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,399
They arrived just in time

200
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:30,039
Proceed as planned

201
00:12:30,039 --> 00:12:30,799
Hold the main gate

202
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:31,440
Yes, sir

203
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:35,840
Sir

204
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:37,679
Wipe them out

205
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:38,840
Attack

206
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,039
Hurry

207
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,519
Hurry

208
00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:13,399
Brothers

209
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:14,399
Hold the line

210
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:27,600
Hurry

211
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,399
How is it?

212
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:20,679
There's still a pulse.

213
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,559
I want him alive.

214
00:14:23,879 --> 00:14:24,919
Take him away.

215
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:31,720
Sir.

216
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,799
Secret passage found.

217
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:34,799
Go down and search immediately.

218
00:14:34,919 --> 00:14:35,600
Yes, sir.

219
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,759
Everyone, be careful.

220
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:52,759
Go in!

221
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,440
Clear.

222
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:02,879
Sir.

223
00:15:02,919 --> 00:15:03,559
Sir.

224
00:15:17,879 --> 00:15:18,679
Move aside.

225
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:20,679
Everyone, move aside.

226
00:15:21,639 --> 00:15:22,639
On official duty.

227
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,200
Don't block the way.

228
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,000
Up.

229
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,919
Not enough time.

230
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,120
Again.

231
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,000
Down.

232
00:16:09,559 --> 00:16:10,360
Pick it up.

233
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:12,840
Too slow.

234
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,120
Draw your gun.

235
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,000
Stand up.

236
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,279
Draw your gun.

237
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:22,799
Draw your gun.

238
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:24,720
Stand up.

239
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,720
Stand up.

240
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,320
Stand up.

241
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,519
Draw your gun.

242
00:16:31,879 --> 00:16:33,120
Pick up the gun.

243
00:16:33,799 --> 00:16:34,720
Stand up.

244
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:35,759
Draw your gun.

245
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:39,000
Can't draw the gun.

246
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,879
You'll end up just like them.

247
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,720
How is the director?

248
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:26,279
Director.

249
00:17:38,839 --> 00:17:39,880
How is the director, really?

250
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,720
Say something, you guys.

251
00:17:56,079 --> 00:17:57,240
Stand up.

252
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:02,559
Stand up.

253
00:18:03,319 --> 00:18:04,119
Captain Bai.

254
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,880
Look at all of you.

255
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,119
Every time we go on a mission,

256
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:16,720
isn't it always a matter of life and death?

257
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,720
The boss is tough.

258
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,200
He'll be fine.

259
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,839
He'll be fine.

260
00:18:43,319 --> 00:18:44,119
Come in.

261
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,440
Miss, you have a letter.

262
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,599
Where is it from?

263
00:18:57,599 --> 00:18:59,799
A messenger brought it from the hospital.

264
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:02,720
Thank you.

265
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,720
You may go.

266
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:12,799
Boss

267
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,119
He's awake.

268
00:20:15,559 --> 00:20:16,400
He's awake.

269
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,079
He's awake.

270
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:19,599
He's awake.

271
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:30,680
Director

272
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:34,680
Thank you.

273
00:20:40,359 --> 00:20:41,160
Director

274
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:42,880
I know you love tea.

275
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,400
I brought this for you.

276
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,799
A Yixing clay teapot.

277
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:48,920
Just put it there.

278
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,279
Liang Shuo is awake.

279
00:21:01,599 --> 00:21:02,400
He's awake.

280
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,480
Everyone from the Operations Department went to the hospital.

281
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,079
In the office,

282
00:21:07,079 --> 00:21:08,720
only two field agents are left.

283
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,599
That's really a bit much.

284
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,119
The Operations Department people are outside.

285
00:21:18,279 --> 00:21:19,640
Which one is easier to handle?

286
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:22,200
But he can handle them perfectly.

287
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:23,880
In this regard,

288
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,960
you really should learn from him.

289
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,359
Learn well.

290
00:21:34,519 --> 00:21:36,240
What do you think about this?

291
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,000
Water torture.

292
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:42,079
It is indeed commonly used by the Military Bureau.

293
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:45,119
For the victim,

294
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:47,039
it's worse than death.

295
00:21:47,359 --> 00:21:49,160
During the process,

296
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,920
a slight mistake can lead to drowning.

297
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,640
If that's the case,

298
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:55,559
why didn't they just kill Liang Shuo?

299
00:21:55,759 --> 00:21:56,640
Sir,

300
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,119
do you think

301
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,279
there's something fishy about this?

302
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:02,680
Director Liang is very shrewd.

303
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,160
I admit I'm not as good as him.

304
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:06,319
But, Director,

305
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:08,000
don't you find it strange?

306
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:08,720
Strange?

307
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,720
What are you trying to say?

308
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,400
Both the Yulongshan escort and this Military Bureau raid

309
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,839
were meticulously planned,

310
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:18,960
fully prepared,

311
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,400
yet both ended in failure.

312
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,480
And both times, Director Liang was in charge.

313
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,039
I know

314
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:27,240
many people say I have a grudge against Director Liang,

315
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,440
that I want to drive him out of No. 76.

316
00:22:30,359 --> 00:22:31,480
Those are just petty rumors.

317
00:22:32,119 --> 00:22:33,160
Groundless and baseless.

318
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,799
I had my doubts too.

319
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:42,279
But from a medical perspective,

320
00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:43,680
the duration of asphyxiation

321
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,559
could never be that long.

322
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,599
From the moment we surrounded to when we broke in,

323
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,799
it would require precise timing.

324
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,640
It's extremely difficult.

325
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,279
A slight mistake could cost a life.

326
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:58,559
Motegi Kazuhisa is proof of that.

327
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:00,960
If necessary, we can add more bait.

328
00:23:04,039 --> 00:23:05,799
You have to cast a long line to catch a big fish.

329
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:07,200
Then,

330
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,359
continue investigating Liang Shuo.

331
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,519
Yes, sir.

332
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,720
Chief, you don't actually believe it, do you?

333
00:23:12,079 --> 00:23:13,119
Then you,

334
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,079
do you really have such intentions?

335
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:17,839
Of course not.

336
00:23:18,279 --> 00:23:19,240
I suspect Liang Shuo

337
00:23:19,279 --> 00:23:20,720
only out of duty.

338
00:23:21,319 --> 00:23:23,119
If Liang Shuo is an anti-Japanese agent,

339
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:25,279
it would implicate all of Unit 76.

340
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,039
Especially you, Chief.

341
00:23:32,039 --> 00:23:33,839
This is what you asked me to investigate earlier:

342
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,720
Liang Shuo's activities after returning from Yulong Mountain,

343
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,200
all his daily movements.

344
00:23:47,119 --> 00:23:47,839
Chief.

345
00:23:48,079 --> 00:23:48,799
Then,

346
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:49,880
I...

347
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:52,759
Yes.

348
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:22,359
You may leave now.

349
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,319
Yes, sir.

350
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,279
Director Liang's ability to recover

351
00:24:38,279 --> 00:24:39,960
is truly remarkable.

352
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:44,799
It's all thanks to your care, Chief Hirata.

353
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,319
I was able to survive because of it.

354
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:49,160
Today,

355
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:51,559
you even went out of your way to bring me back.

356
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:52,880
I really feel embarrassed.

357
00:24:54,039 --> 00:24:55,480
Especially regarding Captain Motegi,

358
00:24:56,079 --> 00:24:57,119
his matter

359
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,480
will naturally be settled with the Military Bureau.

360
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,720
But I still prefer

361
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,680
that you call me

362
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,759
Miss Hirata.

363
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,240
It seems

364
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,519
you no longer suspect me.

365
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,920
At least, you've shown me

366
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,440
your determination to catch Scorpio on your own.

367
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:24,599
That really moved me.

368
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,000
I believe

369
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:29,720
we can pursue deeper cooperation.

370
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:35,039
You are already

371
00:25:35,319 --> 00:25:38,000
the captain of the gendarmerie at the Japanese Special Operations Headquarters.

372
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:39,480
Doesn't that already count as

373
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,880
deep cooperation with the Special Operations Headquarters?

374
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,519
That's right.

375
00:25:46,519 --> 00:25:47,720
But what I mean is

376
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,000
a more personal relationship.

377
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,200
A personal relationship?

378
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:56,400
If I may speak frankly,

379
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:59,079
Director Liang, now that you are at the Special Operations Headquarters,

380
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,480
don't you feel stifled?

381
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,640
Outstanding people

382
00:26:03,839 --> 00:26:05,440
are always envied by others.

383
00:26:06,279 --> 00:26:08,799
Especially talents like Director Liang.

384
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:11,759
I believe, Director Liang,

385
00:26:11,759 --> 00:26:13,200
you can also feel it.

386
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,519
Your current position at the Special Operations Headquarters

387
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,519
is not what it used to be.

388
00:26:18,039 --> 00:26:19,480
Suspected by your superiors,

389
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,640
undermined by your colleagues,

390
00:26:23,079 --> 00:26:24,720
and appearing powerless.

391
00:26:26,319 --> 00:26:28,079
It's truly heartbreaking.

392
00:26:32,039 --> 00:26:33,599
Life is full of ups and downs.

393
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,920
I've learned to take them calmly.

394
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,359
I really admire your state of mind, Director Liang.

395
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:41,799
But

396
00:26:42,319 --> 00:26:43,720
if you have a choice,

397
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,920
why not choose

398
00:26:46,119 --> 00:26:48,240
a path that's more comfortable for yourself?

399
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:50,519
Director Liang, you have great ambitions.

400
00:26:50,519 --> 00:26:53,319
You aspire to advance to the Central Executive Committee.

401
00:26:53,519 --> 00:26:55,599
But because of the Yulongshan incident,

402
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,920
your path to promotion

403
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,880
has encountered some obstacles.

404
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,599
The loyalty test

405
00:27:01,599 --> 00:27:02,920
has also been put on hold for now.

406
00:27:03,559 --> 00:27:04,359
However,

407
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:06,440
Director Liang,

408
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:08,480
if you could become friends with me,

409
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,599
I will definitely

410
00:27:11,799 --> 00:27:13,519
give you an appropriate reward.

411
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:22,880
It seems, Director Liang,

412
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:24,759
you still need some time to think it over.

413
00:27:25,759 --> 00:27:26,599
That's all right.

414
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:29,599
I have patience.

415
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,640
Team Leader,

416
00:27:49,079 --> 00:27:49,920
please have some tea.

417
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:56,000
Team Leader

418
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,440
This Liang Shuo and Director Hirata

419
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,759
what's their relationship?

420
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:02,920
What relationship?

421
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:05,240
A woman who's eager to show off

422
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:07,519
hasn't even found her footing yet

423
00:28:08,599 --> 00:28:10,759
and already wants a share at the Peace Conference

424
00:28:10,759 --> 00:28:12,480
She and Liang Shuo are quite a match

425
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,440
Such big appetites

426
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,799
Aren't they afraid they can't handle it?

427
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,119
It's laughable

428
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:18,799
You two

429
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,400
What are you talking about?

430
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,119
Nothing

431
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,359
Just

432
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:26,559
making small talk

433
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,279
Alright

434
00:28:33,559 --> 00:28:34,359
Director

435
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:37,200
Director Hirata said some things to his subordinates

436
00:28:38,039 --> 00:28:39,319
that were hard to understand

437
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,440
Let's not rush to discuss this today

438
00:28:42,839 --> 00:28:43,599
How are you feeling?

439
00:28:43,759 --> 00:28:44,839
Are you feeling better?

440
00:28:45,759 --> 00:28:47,039
Thank you for your concern, Director

441
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,160
I'm fine now

442
00:28:48,839 --> 00:28:49,920
Then, let's go

443
00:28:54,319 --> 00:28:56,599
Didn't Hirata Xizi suspect him?

444
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,039
Why did she change so quickly?

445
00:28:59,039 --> 00:28:59,839
Team Leader

446
00:29:00,119 --> 00:29:01,480
About the position in the Special Investigation Division

447
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:02,759
Shut up

448
00:29:05,559 --> 00:29:06,559
Continue surveillance.

449
00:29:06,759 --> 00:29:08,359
There must be something wrong with Liang Shuo.

450
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,440
Even if he managed to get through the interrogation,

451
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:12,200
it doesn't mean

452
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,839
he's completely in the clear.

453
00:29:14,079 --> 00:29:14,880
Yes.

454
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:17,400
The news about cracking the Military Command's case

455
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,960
came to me while you were on your way back.

456
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,400
I had already received it.

457
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:22,160
The news spread quickly.

458
00:29:22,359 --> 00:29:23,839
Director Zhou from the Special Committee

459
00:29:23,839 --> 00:29:25,039
even called specifically

460
00:29:25,319 --> 00:29:26,319
to instruct me

461
00:29:26,319 --> 00:29:27,640
to be clear with rewards and punishments.

462
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,359
The director personally welcoming you

463
00:29:31,759 --> 00:29:33,240
is the best reward.

464
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,039
What is it?

465
00:29:35,799 --> 00:29:37,119
Do you have something to say?

466
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,480
At the bar,

467
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,559
I was set up.

468
00:29:42,039 --> 00:29:44,079
If Director Hirata hadn't made other arrangements,

469
00:29:44,599 --> 00:29:46,119
I probably wouldn't have made it back.

470
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,039
If you have any doubts,

471
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,599
just speak up.

472
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,039
Our operation

473
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,759
was compromised

474
00:29:54,119 --> 00:29:55,519
from the very beginning.

475
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,160
This suspicion

476
00:29:57,359 --> 00:29:58,880
was something I brought up

477
00:29:59,119 --> 00:30:00,960
to both of you when I first returned to headquarters.

478
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,359
I still hold this view.

479
00:30:03,759 --> 00:30:04,839
Within our organization,

480
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,920
there is a Military Command mole.

481
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,480
Yes.

482
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,839
From receiving the tip-off to taking action

483
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:15,039
it was only a matter of a few hours.

484
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,160
Such a short amount of time

485
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,680
seems unlikely.

486
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,160
A short timeframe

487
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:22,519
is actually the most frightening.

488
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,759
Tell me

489
00:30:24,759 --> 00:30:25,839
your plan.

490
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,440
I do have some leads

491
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,680
that I want to start investigating.

492
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,240
I hope you can support me, Director.

493
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,000
Go ahead and investigate as you see fit.

494
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,599
As long as you find solid evidence,

495
00:30:38,759 --> 00:30:39,640
I promise

496
00:30:40,119 --> 00:30:42,880
there will be no tolerance or leniency.

497
00:30:44,039 --> 00:30:45,240
With your word, Director,

498
00:30:45,359 --> 00:30:46,440
I feel reassured.

499
00:30:46,519 --> 00:30:47,240
Alright,

500
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,400
let's not talk about this anymore.

501
00:30:49,119 --> 00:30:50,559
It's good that you could come back.

502
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:52,720
The sun still rises as usual.

503
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:53,880
From now on,

504
00:30:54,279 --> 00:30:56,720
you'll continue as the head of the operations department.

505
00:30:56,839 --> 00:30:57,960
I've already explained everything

506
00:30:58,039 --> 00:31:00,480
to the General Affairs Office.

507
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:01,400
Today

508
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,839
marks your official return.

509
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,160
If there's anything else,

510
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,599
we'll talk about it later.

511
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:08,400
Thank you, Director.

512
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:11,759
Take care, Director Li.

513
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:16,359
Director

514
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,240
Captain Bai instructed me.

515
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,400
I'll take you home today.

516
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,400
He also gave me the keys.

517
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,079
How about

518
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:21,519
I help you pack your things?

519
00:31:22,039 --> 00:31:22,839
No need to pack.

520
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:24,240
Let's just go back directly.

521
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,039
Alright.

522
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:31,559
Director

523
00:31:31,559 --> 00:31:32,400
I'll go get the car.

524
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,440
Chief Chen

525
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:34,680
Director Liang

526
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:35,680
Congratulations.

527
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,240
It seems our Director Liang

528
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:39,240
has regained the chief's trust.

529
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,400
If it weren't for Chief Chen,

530
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,839
there wouldn't be any "regained" at all.

531
00:31:44,359 --> 00:31:47,519
I remember it was Director Liang who accidentally leaked information.

532
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:51,000
That's how Yan Jiu managed to survive until the Yulongshan operation.

533
00:31:51,079 --> 00:31:53,200
I know Chief Chen is very eloquent.

534
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,759
Your ability to stir up trouble

535
00:31:54,759 --> 00:31:55,720
has always been impressive.

536
00:31:56,079 --> 00:31:57,000
I didn't expect

537
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,319
your talent for bringing up old issues

538
00:31:58,319 --> 00:31:59,799
is just as strong.

539
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:01,920
Director Liang

540
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,640
I really can't take that kind of praise.

541
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:05,240
You're truly blessed and lucky.

542
00:32:05,319 --> 00:32:06,920
You went into the thieves' den

543
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,720
and came out without a scratch.

544
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,640
A real hero.

545
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:12,880
I truly admire you.

546
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,440
It seems

547
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:17,759
I've disappointed Chief Chen.

548
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,599
It's really strange when you think about it.

549
00:32:20,039 --> 00:32:21,799
Everything was planned so thoroughly,

550
00:32:22,039 --> 00:32:23,759
and prepared so well,

551
00:32:24,039 --> 00:32:26,279
so how did it end in such a disaster?

552
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,680
I couldn't figure it out at first either.

553
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,680
But now, seeing Chief Chen,

554
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,640
I suddenly understand a bit.

555
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:33,920
After all,

556
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,440
in our headquarters,

557
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,480
no department

558
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:38,920
handles the transmission and reception of intelligence

559
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:41,079
more efficiently than the Communications Unit.

560
00:32:41,079 --> 00:32:41,960
Liang Shuo.

561
00:32:42,119 --> 00:32:44,039
Are you trying to accuse me of something?

562
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,039
Did I say it was Chief Chen?

563
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,240
Or are you saying

564
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,440
the Communications Unit

565
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:50,920
is Chief Chen's personal property?

566
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:51,440
You—

567
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,200
Also,

568
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,079
I'd like to remind Chief Chen

569
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,799
when speaking to a superior,

570
00:32:56,039 --> 00:32:57,279
don't be too presumptuous.

571
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,119
The last person who did that

572
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:01,079
had their tongue rot in my flowerbed

573
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:02,240
as fertilizer.

574
00:33:36,279 --> 00:33:37,559
I'm saving you.

575
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,079
Do you understand?

576
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,240
Do what you can.

577
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,440
Leave the rest to fate.

578
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,440
Listen.

579
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:45,839
Hold on for me.

580
00:33:46,039 --> 00:33:47,240
You must survive.

581
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,240
Complete the mission.

582
00:33:48,759 --> 00:33:49,400
Teacher.

583
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,200
The Japanese are coming.

584
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,599
The brothers can't hold on much longer.

585
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:09,159
Congratulations on your recovery, Mr. Lu.

586
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:11,920
Chief Mizuno asked me to host a welcome dinner for you.

587
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:04,480
Where are we going now?

588
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:06,159
To Plum Blossom Hall.

589
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:10,079
Mr. Mizuno has something to tell you.

590
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:12,320
It'll make future work easier.

591
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,280
Brothers!

592
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,280
Charge!

593
00:36:46,559 --> 00:36:47,679
Leave someone alive!

594
00:37:03,239 --> 00:37:04,599
Brothers, cover me!

595
00:37:04,599 --> 00:37:05,320
Yes!

596
00:37:12,679 --> 00:37:13,760
Open fire!

597
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:26,159
Lu Xijian!

598
00:37:27,679 --> 00:37:29,159
Traitor to the nation!

599
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,039
Today is the day you die!

600
00:37:34,199 --> 00:37:35,400
Don't shoot!

601
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:44,159
Brothers, charge for me!

602
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,800
Everyone, charge!

603
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,280
Xiao Si!

604
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,159
Are you crazy?

605
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,880
Why did you come here? Leave now!

606
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,519
You don't deserve the codename Scholar.

607
00:38:21,679 --> 00:38:23,320
You can still leave now.

608
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:25,159
It's not too late for you to turn back.

609
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,199
Do you know what will happen if you choose this path?

610
00:38:27,199 --> 00:38:28,239
What fate awaits you?

611
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,039
Then what are you waiting for?

612
00:38:31,199 --> 00:38:32,079
Shoot!

613
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,480
Tell me—

614
00:38:36,519 --> 00:38:37,880
Is there something you're struggling with?

615
00:38:42,159 --> 00:38:43,639
Say something! Speak!

616
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:45,360
Tell me!

617
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:49,880
Say something!

618
00:38:56,519 --> 00:38:57,320
Speak!

619
00:38:58,599 --> 00:38:59,400
Go, quickly!

620
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,280
Say something!

621
00:39:02,119 --> 00:39:03,039
Xiao Si!

622
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:04,639
Go!

623
00:39:05,159 --> 00:39:06,320
I want to know.

624
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:07,760
Tell me!

625
00:39:44,119 --> 00:39:45,519
Mr. Lu's determination

626
00:39:45,679 --> 00:39:47,960
I will inform Director Mizuno

627
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,599
Take him back

628
00:39:51,719 --> 00:39:52,800
Treat him well

629
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:53,679
Yes

630
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:17,760
Hello

631
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:18,719
Old Five

632
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,079
Brother Liu

633
00:40:20,719 --> 00:40:21,920
How are things in Shanghai?

634
00:40:22,719 --> 00:40:23,639
The Snow Blind Plan

635
00:40:23,719 --> 00:40:25,599
The most crucial part has encountered a problem

636
00:40:26,519 --> 00:40:28,079
Didn't you already find the person?

637
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,320
Yes, we found him

638
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,559
But whether mentally or physically

639
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:33,599
he is no longer fit to carry out the plan

640
00:40:33,719 --> 00:40:34,840
At the moment

641
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,280
he is still an unknown variable

642
00:40:36,719 --> 00:40:37,719
I'm worried

643
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:40,239
he won't make it to the execution of the plan

644
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,159
Besides

645
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,159
our current operations in Shanghai

646
00:40:43,559 --> 00:40:44,719
need personnel support

647
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,559
the situation has not improved

648
00:40:46,719 --> 00:40:47,840
We need to see

649
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,159
some results achieved

650
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,119
By the time that happens

651
00:40:50,119 --> 00:40:51,440
it will be too late

652
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,719
The last request for funds and personnel

653
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,199
still hasn't been approved

654
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:58,320
Over in Shanghai

655
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:00,719
you'll have to rely on yourself for now

656
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:03,599
Tell Mr. Dai

657
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,719
I've prepared a backup plan

658
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:06,960
A backup plan

659
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,480
But time is running out

660
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:09,920
I urgently need

661
00:41:10,039 --> 00:41:11,760
support that can be provided immediately

662
00:41:13,039 --> 00:41:13,840
Alright

663
00:41:14,119 --> 00:41:15,000
Then I'll

664
00:41:15,159 --> 00:41:16,559
submit another request for you

665
00:41:20,559 --> 00:41:21,239
Teacher

666
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,800
We have no choice but to risk everything.

667
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:25,159
We all need time.

668
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,119
Especially Liang Shuo.

669
00:41:27,679 --> 00:41:29,119
We're running out of time.

670
00:41:29,639 --> 00:41:31,079
If we miss this opportunity,

671
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,320
the Snow Blind Project will be left to fate.

672
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,320
There will definitely be a way.

673
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,360
Keep a close watch on Liang Shuo.
