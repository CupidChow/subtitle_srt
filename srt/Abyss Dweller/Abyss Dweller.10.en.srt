1
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,760
Chengchun

2
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,079
Under the bed

3
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,199
Here

4
00:02:59,199 --> 00:02:59,879
Yan Jia

5
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,000
Call the brothers down.

6
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,639
You two come down.

7
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,439
Count all the explosives.

8
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:12,960
Hurry.

9
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,759
Okay.

10
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,800
Xiao Xie

11
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:22,240
How has the military police's security been lately?

12
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:23,560
All these days,

13
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,759
they've set up roadblocks outside,

14
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,120
patrolling day and night in shifts,

15
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:27,520
never letting their guard down for a moment.

16
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,719
These Japanese are really something else.

17
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:30,560
They're watching so closely,

18
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:31,960
let alone a car,

19
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,439
not even a sparrow could get out.

20
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:34,879
The Japanese keep changing their shift and patrol times.

21
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:36,199
They're always changing them.

22
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:38,000
There's really no gap to exploit.

23
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:39,960
We finally got our hands on it,

24
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,960
but we can't get it out.

25
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,080
We can't go on like this.

26
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:45,680
Don't worry.

27
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:48,039
There will definitely be a way.

28
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,520
Tomorrow at noon

29
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,719
at the Japanese Army Club

30
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:05,280
there will be a small cocktail party

31
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,319
I am here to personally invite Director Liang to attend

32
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,639
Additionally

33
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:11,520
I also want to ask Director Liang

34
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,960
about my previous proposal

35
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,159
what you think

36
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:18,360
Thank you, Miss Hirata, for the invitation

37
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,040
As for the previous proposal

38
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:21,160
to me

39
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,519
it is indeed very appropriate and timely

40
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:26,800
So

41
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:29,199
Director Liang has agreed

42
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:33,839
I have no reason to refuse

43
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:34,959
Besides

44
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,240
when facing Miss Hirata

45
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:39,279
such a beautiful lady

46
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:46,439
A wise man submits to circumstances

47
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,360
I will also speak well of you at headquarters

48
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:50,480
on your behalf, Director Liang

49
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:52,839
After all, Director Liang is just one step away

50
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,519
there is still a chance

51
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,959
I hope we can work well together in the future

52
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,160
It would be my honor

53
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,040
I originally thought

54
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,759
Director Liang would take a few more days to consider.

55
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,759
I didn't expect such decisiveness.

56
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,720
Having narrowly escaped death recently,

57
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,680
my mind has become much clearer.

58
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,439
I'm also increasingly certain

59
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,879
that within the Special Operations Headquarters

60
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,040
there are some unstable elements.

61
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:28,879
This is also why I decided

62
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:30,160
to cooperate with Miss Hirata

63
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,000
on a deeper level.

64
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:34,959
Unstable elements?

65
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:37,920
Director Liang, do you think

66
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,680
the Special Operations Headquarters

67
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,720
is harboring anti-Japanese agents?

68
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:42,920
Yes.

69
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,240
If it hadn't been for Miss Hirata

70
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,800
leaving a backup plan in the arrangements before,

71
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:47,839
at this moment

72
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:49,600
I would no longer be alive.

73
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:51,519
Do you have any suspects?

74
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,720
Of course.

75
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,800
Who?

76
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,519
Before I have concrete evidence,

77
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,720
please allow me to keep it a secret for now.

78
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,360
You really are cautious.

79
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:04,199
When necessary,

80
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:08,240
I would also like Director Hirata to provide personnel support.

81
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:10,399
As long as we can catch the infiltrator,

82
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,399
no matter what kind of support is needed,

83
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,240
I will do my utmost.

84
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,639
That would be great.

85
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,639
There's one more thing.

86
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:19,399
I’d like to trouble Director Liang.

87
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,720
Mr. Mizuno asked me to pay attention to

88
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,319
the issue of illegal smuggling within the Special Operations Headquarters.

89
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,720
I wonder if Director Liang

90
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,839
has any leads to offer.

91
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:30,199
Smuggling?

92
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,519
That's right.

93
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:33,360
According to our investigation,

94
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:35,240
within the Special Operations Headquarters,

95
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:38,879
someone has been illegally selling weapons and ammunition to the war zone.

96
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,120
This situation

97
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,439
is happening during the preparations for the Peace Conference.

98
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:43,800
It's not a minor issue.

99
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:45,079
In addition,

100
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:47,839
Yan Jiu's supplies still haven't been found.

101
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,160
From any perspective,

102
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,800
or through any channel,

103
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:54,720
we cannot give anti-Japanese elements any opportunity.

104
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,600
Director Hirata makes a good point.

105
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,600
However,

106
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:02,480
I am the Director of Operations.

107
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,279
I'm afraid this is beyond my authority.

108
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:07,879
Director Liang, you can consider this

109
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,680
a test of your loyalty to me.

110
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,519
Of course.

111
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,680
As long as Miss Hirata asks,

112
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,800
I will certainly do my best.

113
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,120
Then,

114
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,199
I’ll be waiting for your good news, Director Liang.

115
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,040
Reporting, sir.

116
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:30,639
Our men have uncovered an underground party radio station.

117
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:32,120
It's nearby.

118
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:36,480
We just uncovered an underground party radio station.

119
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:38,000
It's close by.

120
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,519
Director Liang, are you interested?

121
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:41,800
Would you like to take a look together?

122
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,360
Of course.

123
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:28,319
Sir

124
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,759
This Communist can't escape.

125
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,720
We can shoot him at any time.

126
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,799
I want him alive.

127
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,159
Yes, sir.

128
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,000
Take him alive.

129
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,759
Like a moth to a flame.

130
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,440
Go.

131
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:33,000
Don't worry about me, run!

132
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Old Fu

133
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,639
Take him alive.

134
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:09,440
Uncle Yan

135
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:10,519
What are you doing?

136
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:15,159
If I die,

137
00:10:15,159 --> 00:10:16,879
you can live.

138
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:18,200
Uncle Yan

139
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:33,919
Everyone, go help.

140
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,000
Director Liang

141
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:48,480
I'll go too.

142
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,080
Director Liang

143
00:11:42,279 --> 00:11:43,440
Did you see him?

144
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:45,480
I arrived too late.

145
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,639
I didn't catch him.

146
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:53,759
It's alright.

147
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,159
I'll handle it.

148
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,759
I really didn't expect it.

149
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,480
You're quite resourceful.

150
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:07,720
What Chengchun and Yanjia couldn't accomplish

151
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,720
was accomplished by you.

152
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,159
Liang Shuo isn't like you said at all.

153
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,799
He has his own moral standards.

154
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,960
He knows when

155
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,480
to do the right thing.

156
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:20,279
I just treated him sincerely.

157
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,519
I didn't use any of your tricks.

158
00:12:25,559 --> 00:12:26,600
Things change with people.

159
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,440
That can be a method too.

160
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,480
Isn't that so?

161
00:12:31,879 --> 00:12:33,200
A good political party

162
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,840
should inspire people.

163
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:36,600
Make them follow from the heart.

164
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:37,720
Not by using those

165
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,759
hypocritical morals and righteousness

166
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:40,559
to coerce

167
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:41,679
and control others.

168
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:43,679
No matter what you think,

169
00:12:44,919 --> 00:12:46,039
since you're staying here,

170
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:47,440
you'd better remember one thing.

171
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,759
I'm not just your uncle.

172
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:51,360
I'm also your superior.

173
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,639
Orders must be followed without exception.

174
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:55,120
That's the rule of the Military Bureau.

175
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,919
It's also the foundation

176
00:12:56,919 --> 00:12:58,759
for the success of any operation.

177
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,159
You are my uncle.

178
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:05,320
But you're no longer my superior.

179
00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:07,399
I won't return to the Bureau anymore.

180
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,000
Chongqing has nothing to do with me now.

181
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:12,279
If you want me to stay and help you,

182
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,039
I want to set some conditions.

183
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,320
You want to negotiate with me?

184
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:20,279
Go ahead.

185
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:22,759
About the withdrawal at Pingjia Lane,

186
00:13:22,759 --> 00:13:24,559
I'll find a way to get Liang Shuo to help.

187
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,960
But on one condition:

188
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:27,679
You must transfer him out of Shanghai.

189
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:28,759
Give him his freedom.

190
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,360
Wishful thinking.

191
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:36,000
After what happened with Yan Jiu at Yulong Mountain,

192
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,919
Liang Shuo hates you to the core.

193
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,200
At No. 76,

194
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,840
his life is in constant danger.

195
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:42,399
You don't really think

196
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:44,559
he'll keep cooperating with you, do you?

197
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,519
He has to cooperate, whether he wants to or not.

198
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,159
Even if he doesn't want to, he still has to.

199
00:13:48,279 --> 00:13:49,519
It's his duty.

200
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,039
You're that confident?

201
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,200
Fine.

202
00:13:52,679 --> 00:13:55,120
Then try persuading him your way.

203
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,759
Go ahead and try.

204
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,600
But don't forget,

205
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:00,559
the key

206
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,159
was brought back by me.

207
00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:04,440
I'm leaving.

208
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:06,360
Wait.

209
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,399
What is it?

210
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:16,240
If you can convince him to withdraw from Pingjia Lane,

211
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,720
I might consider letting him go.

212
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:21,200
Remember what you said.

213
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,399
From now on

214
00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:29,039
this will be your home.

215
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,360
Uncle

216
00:16:50,919 --> 00:16:52,279
Now that Central and Southern China have fallen,

217
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:53,679
Changsha is in a state of emergency.

218
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,879
Our Chinese nation is at a critical moment of life and death.

219
00:16:57,639 --> 00:16:59,000
The Japanese invaders are rampant.

220
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:00,200
The sounds of war never cease.

221
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,799
The calamity of war has swept across China.

222
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,759
Even an ordinary person cannot shirk his responsibility.

223
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,279
In the past, I joined the army but failed to die for my country.

224
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,599
Now, I have spent all my family fortune

225
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,400
to purchase military supplies.

226
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,680
to support the nation.

227
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:16,200
Please do not refuse.

228
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:18,839
Seeing Manchuria fall,

229
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:20,480
I know my life is in danger.

230
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,880
I am willing to join the army and follow the Scorpion Plan.

231
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,640
Crossing the river and burning the boats, there is no turning back.

232
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:33,759
Director.

233
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:35,119
Come in.

234
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:40,200
Director.

235
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,039
Just now, from Xiyuan Road,

236
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:42,319
Fenghua Clothing Store called.

237
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:44,039
They said your tailored suit is ready.

238
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:45,599
They reminded you not to forget to try it on.

239
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,079
I understand.

240
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,759
If it's inconvenient for you,

241
00:17:48,759 --> 00:17:49,880
I can go pick it up.

242
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:50,839
No need.

243
00:17:51,319 --> 00:17:52,200
Clothes

244
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,799
are better tried on by myself.

245
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,160
If you have time,

246
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,920
help me find Director Cui.

247
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:57,720
Tell him

248
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,000
I need to talk to him at tomorrow's banquet.

249
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,400
Understood.

250
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:40,680
Mr. Liang

251
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:41,680
The clothes are ready.

252
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,720
Please try them on here.

253
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:43,400
Okay.

254
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,240
There's a tail.

255
00:18:52,039 --> 00:18:52,880
I know.

256
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,680
That's normal for me.

257
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,160
Scorpio sent you here.

258
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,079
Don't worry.

259
00:18:58,079 --> 00:18:59,400
I already work here.

260
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:00,680
He asked me to pass on a message.

261
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,039
It's also related to explosives.

262
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,240
Convince Hirata Xizi.

263
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,640
To withdraw the defense at Pingjia Alley.

264
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,759
Only you can do it.

265
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,559
Don't flatter me.

266
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:09,720
Convince her?

267
00:19:10,119 --> 00:19:12,400
Do you think Hirata Xizi is a three-year-old?

268
00:19:13,079 --> 00:19:14,480
If he really has guts,

269
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:16,119
he should

270
00:19:16,359 --> 00:19:17,599
stop hiding.

271
00:19:18,039 --> 00:19:19,160
I told him already.

272
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,119
After the mission is done,

273
00:19:20,119 --> 00:19:22,000
he'll find a way to get you out of Shanghai.

274
00:19:23,559 --> 00:19:25,000
You told him already?

275
00:19:30,359 --> 00:19:31,920
What kind of person is Scorpio?

276
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:33,200
You know best.

277
00:19:33,319 --> 00:19:35,079
His promises mean nothing.

278
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:37,119
After what happened at Yulong Mountain last time,

279
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,920
I no longer trust him.

280
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:39,640
Tell him

281
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,359
not to come looking for me again.

282
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,640
This way of meeting

283
00:19:42,839 --> 00:19:44,680
will only increase our risk of exposure.

284
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:46,880
He is him, I am me.

285
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,119
I've delivered your message.

286
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,440
But I respect your choice.

287
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,279
If you really need to contact me in the future,

288
00:19:56,359 --> 00:19:57,640
don't be so reckless again.

289
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,279
Go to the agent headquarters.

290
00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:00,359
On the balcony across the street,

291
00:20:00,359 --> 00:20:01,480
place a pot of orchids.

292
00:20:02,039 --> 00:20:03,799
Then wait for me at the nearest newsstand.

293
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:06,039
Wrap up the clothes.

294
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:06,759
Alright, sir.

295
00:20:06,759 --> 00:20:07,480
Please wait a moment.

296
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:13,000
Sir, it's all packed.

297
00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:14,720
Okay.

298
00:20:16,839 --> 00:20:17,519
Thank you.

299
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:18,480
Sir, take care.

300
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,559
Mr. Liang, take care.

301
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,519
You again.

302
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,319
What do you want?

303
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,920
I should be asking you that.

304
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:21,680
What exactly are you trying to do?

305
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,000
When words don't work, you turn to force, is that it?

306
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,359
I'll say it again.

307
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,200
This isn't just your business.

308
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,680
The teacher has already thought everything through.

309
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,160
You must fully cooperate.

310
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,079
We can't let all our efforts fail because of you.

311
00:21:32,319 --> 00:21:34,000
The Japanese have made a lot of arrangements

312
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:34,960
for this peace conference.

313
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,359
You know nothing about it.

314
00:21:36,759 --> 00:21:38,200
So-called careful planning

315
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:39,519
is just sending more people

316
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:41,039
to their deaths for nothing.

317
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,279
I really didn't expect

318
00:21:42,279 --> 00:21:44,480
that even you, Shadow, would be afraid of dying.

319
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,000
I'm not Shadow.

320
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,799
I'm myself.

321
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:50,400
If we make a scene,

322
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,880
it won't do any of us any good.

323
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,839
Unless you agree

324
00:21:55,319 --> 00:21:56,599
to follow orders.

325
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,759
What if I say no?

326
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,519
If you really have the strength,

327
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:08,839
save it.

328
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,079
Don't waste it here.

329
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:11,640
You're my senior.

330
00:22:12,279 --> 00:22:13,680
I've always respected you.

331
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:15,200
But in this matter,

332
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:17,440
you're truly wrong.

333
00:22:17,799 --> 00:22:19,720
At No. 76, I can barely protect myself.

334
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,759
Everyone wants me dead.

335
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,000
Have you thought about that?

336
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Has he thought about it?

337
00:22:24,759 --> 00:22:25,720
Do you know?

338
00:22:26,319 --> 00:22:27,880
I've always envied you.

339
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,839
Not because you're better than me in skills,

340
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:31,599
but because you

341
00:22:31,799 --> 00:22:34,359
have more chances than us to achieve great things.

342
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,279
You bunch of lunatics.

343
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:45,680
What are you trying to do?

344
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,079
They're gone.

345
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:47,079
Do you still have a way out?

346
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:52,359
Go.

347
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,279
Bastard.

348
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,119
Bastard.

349
00:23:06,759 --> 00:23:07,440
Get out of the way.

350
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,279
This way.

351
00:23:16,279 --> 00:23:16,960
Hurry, hurry.

352
00:23:23,559 --> 00:23:24,519
We've surrounded him.

353
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:26,880
This way, quickly!

354
00:23:27,759 --> 00:23:28,880
This way.

355
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,359
Hurry up.

356
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:40,400
No, don't shoot!

357
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:02,839
Come with me.

358
00:24:02,839 --> 00:24:03,559
Cut off the escape route.

359
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:08,319
Come.

360
00:25:08,319 --> 00:25:09,279
I'll take you away.

361
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:11,839
It's no use.

362
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,640
It's no use.

363
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,400
We

364
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:16,440
are all

365
00:25:16,759 --> 00:25:17,680
just lives.

366
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,279
But the meaning of each life

367
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:21,799
is not the same.

368
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:23,599
Senior brother,

369
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,319
Snow Blind

370
00:25:25,319 --> 00:25:26,200
needs

371
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:26,960
you.

372
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,119
As long as you promise me,

373
00:25:30,839 --> 00:25:33,119
my death won't be in vain.

374
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:52,079
Come here, quickly.

375
00:25:52,279 --> 00:25:53,759
The anti-Japanese elements are here.

376
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,119
What a pity.

377
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,640
We didn't catch any alive.

378
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,319
Isn't that right?

379
00:26:23,319 --> 00:26:24,240
Director Liang.

380
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,160
Team leader.

381
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,000
How should we handle this?

382
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,160
They're all dead.

383
00:26:29,799 --> 00:26:30,960
You tell me, how should we handle it?

384
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,799
Leave it to the Japanese.

385
00:27:24,599 --> 00:27:25,559
Teacher

386
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,079
Yan Jia, he

387
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,079
There's no need to worry

388
00:27:30,759 --> 00:27:32,000
Yan Jia's task

389
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:33,960
can be assigned to someone else

390
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:36,079
Yes

391
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,319
Recklessness and impulsiveness

392
00:27:38,519 --> 00:27:40,519
always come with a price

393
00:27:41,079 --> 00:27:42,119
This kind of price

394
00:27:42,599 --> 00:27:44,440
is not just his alone

395
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,920
but also our whole team's

396
00:27:49,359 --> 00:27:50,359
In your eyes

397
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,240
is there only the mission?

398
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,519
If crying would help

399
00:27:56,759 --> 00:27:58,319
then go ahead and cry out loud

400
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,200
But sadly, the dead cannot come back to life

401
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,680
We can only pull ourselves together

402
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:05,599
to avenge him

403
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,480
What's most important now

404
00:28:08,079 --> 00:28:09,720
is that our operation must go on

405
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,000
Our team

406
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:14,440
is like a precise machine

407
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,559
My top priority is to ensure

408
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:19,119
that every part of this machine

409
00:28:19,839 --> 00:28:21,400
functions properly

410
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:23,799
Liang Shuo

411
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:25,680
He said you are cold and heartless

412
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,759
He really wasn't wrong at all

413
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,400
The students have already gone to see Liang Shuo.

414
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,400
But he truly doesn't recognize us.

415
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:46,160
And he's very hostile toward us.

416
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,519
It's very hard to persuade him.

417
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,079
I should have taught you all this.

418
00:28:50,039 --> 00:28:51,279
To achieve your goal,

419
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:54,319
you should analyze your opponent.

420
00:28:54,519 --> 00:28:55,599
No matter how perfect someone is,

421
00:28:55,759 --> 00:28:57,319
they will always have weaknesses.

422
00:28:57,559 --> 00:28:59,559
Whether it's mental or a flaw in character.

423
00:29:00,279 --> 00:29:01,200
Teacher, you mean...

424
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:02,680
Liang Shuo

425
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,079
is someone who values emotions deeply.

426
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,839
No matter how capable he is,

427
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:08,319
deep down he can't get rid of

428
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:10,079
this weak kindness.

429
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,640
Because of this,

430
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,559
Yan Jiu's death

431
00:29:13,759 --> 00:29:15,119
has tormented him greatly.

432
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,440
You should

433
00:29:18,319 --> 00:29:19,680
make use of this trait.

434
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:20,480
Understood.

435
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:22,880
I will definitely appeal to his emotions this time.

436
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,319
He is our most important link.

437
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,279
More important than anyone else.

438
00:29:29,599 --> 00:29:30,640
Do you understand?

439
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,319
Yes, I understand.

440
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:43,920
If

441
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,079
you can't persuade him,

442
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:48,839
then don't come back to see me.

443
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:52,960
Teacher,

444
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,079
I

445
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,160
swear to complete the mission at all costs.

446
00:30:44,079 --> 00:30:44,920
We

447
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,079
are all

448
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,160
lives

449
00:30:48,119 --> 00:30:49,720
But the meaning of each life

450
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,279
is not the same

451
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,359
Senior Brother

452
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:53,680
Snow blindness

453
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,599
needs

454
00:30:54,599 --> 00:30:55,200
you

455
00:31:27,079 --> 00:31:28,519
You still came.

456
00:31:29,319 --> 00:31:30,519
You were waiting for me.

457
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:38,319
You know him.

458
00:31:38,759 --> 00:31:40,039
Who are you talking about?

459
00:31:42,519 --> 00:31:43,440
Maple Leaf.

460
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,039
Maple Leaf.

461
00:31:58,279 --> 00:31:59,640
He is Maple Leaf.

462
00:32:00,119 --> 00:32:01,440
Then who are you?

463
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:07,279
Qingshuang Drunk on Maple Leaf.

464
00:32:08,319 --> 00:32:10,519
Faint Moon Hidden Among Reeds.

465
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:12,960
Child.

466
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,200
I wasn't wrong about you.

467
00:32:14,519 --> 00:32:16,400
You made the right choice.

468
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:18,759
Qingshuang Drunk on Maple Leaf.

469
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,559
Faint Moon Hidden Among Reeds.

470
00:32:22,079 --> 00:32:23,599
I am your handler.

471
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:24,680
Maple Leaf.

472
00:32:25,119 --> 00:32:26,359
Starting today,

473
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:27,880
your codename will be

474
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:28,960
Qingshuang.

475
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,599
Comrade Qingshuang.

476
00:32:31,119 --> 00:32:32,079
Welcome home.

477
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,240
Qingshuang.

478
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,720
I am Qingshuang.

479
00:32:39,559 --> 00:32:40,640
Comrade Qingshuang.

480
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,119
Welcome home.

481
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:22,279
Comrade Qingshuang

482
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:24,799
The higher-ups have already approved our plan.

483
00:33:25,319 --> 00:33:26,599
This is too dangerous.

484
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:27,960
I will take responsibility.

485
00:33:28,119 --> 00:33:29,400
Make sure this batch of explosives is properly placed.

486
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,599
This is our last chance.

487
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,440
What if they discover us?

488
00:33:33,799 --> 00:33:35,200
I might not be able to save you.

489
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,319
Don't save me.

490
00:33:36,519 --> 00:33:38,319
You must stay at your post.

491
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:39,720
The Abyssal Mission

492
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,279
Only you can complete it.

493
00:33:41,799 --> 00:33:43,279
No one can replace you.

494
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,400
Do you remember

495
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,000
what I once told you?

496
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,000
Life is not just about surviving.

497
00:33:49,559 --> 00:33:50,960
It's about seeking the light and forging the soul.

498
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,359
And vowing to pass on the torch.

499
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,160
As long as the mission can be completed,

500
00:33:54,519 --> 00:33:56,319
even if it costs me my life,

501
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,200
I will not hesitate.

502
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:01,880
Qianyuan

503
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,160
That's great.

504
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:06,440
Qingshuang is coming home.

505
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,000
It makes our current path

506
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:09,400
much clearer.

507
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:10,920
There's more good news.

508
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,559
Qingshuang stored the sulfa drugs in advance

509
00:34:13,559 --> 00:34:16,039
at Warehouse 25 in Lianjiagang.

510
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:17,760
I've already sent someone to retrieve them.

511
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:19,079
Taking the river route,

512
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:21,320
they can reach the base in as little as five days.

513
00:34:22,119 --> 00:34:22,920
Good.

514
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:24,440
Great.

515
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,360
Truly,

516
00:34:26,559 --> 00:34:28,159
we haven't let Maple Leaf down.

517
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:29,679
But

518
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:31,760
the explosives are too large in quantity.

519
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,719
There's no way to avoid the Japanese defenses.

520
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:35,159
How to transport them out

521
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:36,719
is probably a big problem.

522
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:38,760
This problem

523
00:34:39,079 --> 00:34:40,920
should be left for them to solve themselves.

524
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:41,440
Come,

525
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,039
have a seat.

526
00:34:45,079 --> 00:34:45,880
By the way,

527
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,840
Qingshuang mentioned to me

528
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,559
that Maple told him

529
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,280
he must complete

530
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,639
the Abyssal Mission.

531
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:54,760
What is the Abyssal Mission?

532
00:34:55,239 --> 00:34:56,239
The Abyssal Mission

533
00:34:56,519 --> 00:34:58,239
is a secret mission we will carry out

534
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,480
during the Peace Conference.

535
00:35:00,639 --> 00:35:01,920
Our meeting today

536
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,800
is also because the organization has agreed

537
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:06,280
that I can tell you all the details of the mission.

538
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:07,639
Since

539
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,480
the outbreak of the Battle of Songhu,

540
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:10,400
Comrade Maple

541
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,639
has been dedicated to

542
00:35:11,679 --> 00:35:14,280
the rescue and resettlement of refugees in the Shanghai area.

543
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,159
This is also, in Shanghai,

544
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,280
besides intelligence gathering,

545
00:35:18,519 --> 00:35:19,719
our most important task.

546
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:20,880
First,

547
00:35:21,199 --> 00:35:22,280
it is humanitarian aid.

548
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,280
Second,

549
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,480
among these refugees,

550
00:35:24,639 --> 00:35:25,719
a large number

551
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,079
have been inspired by the Party.

552
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:28,400
In the future,

553
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:28,800
in the future,

554
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:30,039
they are very likely

555
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,599
to become a strong force

556
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:32,960
on the battlefield against the Japanese.

557
00:35:34,159 --> 00:35:34,960
Therefore,

558
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:36,599
the rescue of refugees

559
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,159
has already become

560
00:35:38,199 --> 00:35:39,400
in the Shanghai area

561
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,960
a mass anti-Japanese movement's

562
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,480
important component.

563
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:43,800
However,

564
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,639
during the preparations for the Peace Conference,

565
00:35:45,679 --> 00:35:46,360
the Japanese

566
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,159
not only tightened regional control

567
00:35:48,159 --> 00:35:48,880
but also

568
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,239
secretly

569
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,159
arrested two thousand refugees

570
00:35:52,599 --> 00:35:54,000
and detained them in Qingshan's

571
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,559
various secret bases.

572
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Among these refugees

573
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,000
are

574
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:58,840
miners,

575
00:35:58,840 --> 00:35:59,800
printers,

576
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:00,480
repairmen,

577
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,320
and machinists.

578
00:36:01,679 --> 00:36:02,639
If

579
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,559
we can rescue them,

580
00:36:05,039 --> 00:36:05,960
they will become

581
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,079
on future battlefields

582
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:09,840
a force to be reckoned with.

583
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:12,599
But

584
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,760
the information we have now is

585
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:16,320
after the Peace Conference

586
00:36:17,039 --> 00:36:17,800
these people

587
00:36:18,199 --> 00:36:20,480
will all be sent to the Japanese front

588
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:21,360
by then

589
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:21,559
by then

590
00:36:21,719 --> 00:36:24,119
none of the two thousand will make it back alive

591
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,079
so

592
00:36:25,159 --> 00:36:26,239
Comrade Fengye

593
00:36:26,519 --> 00:36:28,360
has drafted the Abyss Plan

594
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,239
on the day of the Peace Conference

595
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,400
the Nationalist Military Bureau

596
00:36:31,519 --> 00:36:33,199
will carry out the Snow Blind Plan

597
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:34,599
which involves

598
00:36:34,599 --> 00:36:35,599
blowing up the venue

599
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:36,480
at that time

600
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,039
the Japanese puppet army

601
00:36:38,039 --> 00:36:39,360
will surely mobilize their forces

602
00:36:39,559 --> 00:36:40,480
to prevent

603
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,880
the Nationalists' bombing operation

604
00:36:42,239 --> 00:36:43,079
at that time

605
00:36:43,239 --> 00:36:44,360
Qingshan Detention Center

606
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,119
will inevitably be weakly guarded

607
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,920
we'll take advantage of this opportunity

608
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:49,280
to sneak into the abyss

609
00:36:50,199 --> 00:36:51,320
and get the refugees

610
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,920
out of the abyss

611
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,239
if we can rescue them

612
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:57,960
but with so many people

613
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:00,000
how can we get them all out?

614
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,400
That's right

615
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,880
during the Peace Conference

616
00:37:04,519 --> 00:37:05,400
the Japanese

617
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,119
will intermittently

618
00:37:07,199 --> 00:37:08,840
block both land and water routes

619
00:37:10,119 --> 00:37:11,440
If we want to get everyone

620
00:37:11,719 --> 00:37:13,280
out safely,

621
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,519
we must figure out

622
00:37:16,159 --> 00:37:17,880
the deployment of the Japanese military police.

623
00:37:18,159 --> 00:37:19,280
We need to adapt to the situation

624
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,199
and make arrangements accordingly.

625
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,440
Mizuno Shingen

626
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:24,519
for the sake of the Peace Conference,

627
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,039
has gone to great lengths

628
00:37:26,559 --> 00:37:27,719
to create a special position

629
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:28,760
to be in charge of

630
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,920
security during the Peace Conference.

631
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,199
Currently,

632
00:37:33,079 --> 00:37:34,480
they are selecting a candidate.

633
00:37:36,639 --> 00:37:38,320
This is our only chance.

634
00:37:40,639 --> 00:37:41,599
So

635
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,360
according to Maple Leaf's plan,

636
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,880
he wants Qingshuang

637
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,320
to compete for this position.

638
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,440
Mizuno Nobukage

639
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,400
Why not have a Japanese person in charge?

640
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:52,920
This person

641
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:55,119
must also be Chinese.

642
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:56,679
So that

643
00:37:57,039 --> 00:37:59,400
between the collaborators and the Japanese,

644
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,760
he can serve as a bridge.

645
00:38:01,559 --> 00:38:02,920
It's a sensitive time right now.

646
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:03,639
After all,

647
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:05,119
those collaborators

648
00:38:05,679 --> 00:38:07,880
don't want to entrust their own safety

649
00:38:08,039 --> 00:38:10,079
entirely to the Japanese.

650
00:38:10,599 --> 00:38:11,320
Right now,

651
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:11,519
right now,

652
00:38:11,519 --> 00:38:12,840
we need to find a way

653
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,559
to help him get this position.

654
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,440
During the Peace Conference,

655
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,760
he can gather the most confidential information.

656
00:38:18,519 --> 00:38:19,480
The Nationalist Party

657
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:21,320
wants to complete the Snow Blind Plan,

658
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:23,119
so they must also

659
00:38:23,199 --> 00:38:24,800
help him get this position.

660
00:38:25,559 --> 00:38:26,960
By using his Military Bureau identity,

661
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,000
he'll have more room to maneuver.

662
00:38:29,199 --> 00:38:30,360
I'll remind him

663
00:38:30,719 --> 00:38:32,000
to keep up appearances

664
00:38:32,159 --> 00:38:33,880
and continue cooperating with Scorpio's operations.

665
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:36,800
As for the rest,

666
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,119
what we can do

667
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,840
is help Qingshuang

668
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,480
clear away obstacles.

669
00:38:46,239 --> 00:38:47,039
Old Tan,

670
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:49,039
he wants to get rid of someone.

671
00:38:56,719 --> 00:38:58,000
Sir, your quinine water.

672
00:39:01,039 --> 00:39:02,599
You came at just the right time.

673
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,320
Quinine water.

674
00:39:04,559 --> 00:39:05,519
I know your rules.

675
00:39:05,519 --> 00:39:06,519
You only drink this.

676
00:39:06,679 --> 00:39:07,679
I ordered it especially for you.

677
00:39:12,639 --> 00:39:13,519
Thank you.

678
00:39:15,679 --> 00:39:16,480
You're welcome.

679
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,760
What's with all the secrecy?

680
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:23,599
Brother Cui, you probably don't know.

681
00:39:24,519 --> 00:39:25,400
The Japanese

682
00:39:25,639 --> 00:39:28,280
are planning to take action against smuggling within the Special Operations Headquarters.

683
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,480
They're making a move.

684
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,920
Where did you get this information?

685
00:39:34,199 --> 00:39:35,000
Sit down, let's talk.

686
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,880
Why are the Japanese investigating smuggling?

687
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,400
Keep your voice down.

688
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,679
Hirata Noriko tipped me off.

689
00:39:48,559 --> 00:39:50,159
Why would she tell you that?

690
00:39:50,599 --> 00:39:51,800
Why do you think?

691
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:53,920
To win me over.

692
00:39:54,039 --> 00:39:56,039
Just trying to get closer to me.

693
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:58,159
The Japanese suspect

694
00:39:58,679 --> 00:40:00,760
that the smuggling within headquarters

695
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,280
is connected to anti-Japanese elements.

696
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,199
That's impossible.

697
00:40:03,199 --> 00:40:03,719
This...

698
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,159
No, no.

699
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:06,280
That's not it.

700
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:06,960
Brother,

701
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,440
the label of "anti-Japanese element"

702
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,679
can't be thrown around carelessly.

703
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:15,159
Whether it's catching anti-Japanese elements

704
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:17,320
or rooting out corruption,

705
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:18,679
the Japanese want to investigate,

706
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:20,199
they always need an excuse.

707
00:40:20,599 --> 00:40:22,320
I'm just giving you a heads-up.

708
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,079
For the time being,

709
00:40:23,079 --> 00:40:24,000
keep a low profile.

710
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:27,639
No.

711
00:40:28,119 --> 00:40:30,000
About the smuggling at headquarters,

712
00:40:31,159 --> 00:40:33,079
I'm just helping the director.

713
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:34,840
Don't you know that?

714
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,679
The little money allocated to headquarters from above

715
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,239
is just a tiny amount.

716
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:39,719
After buying radios

717
00:40:39,719 --> 00:40:40,679
and ammunition,

718
00:40:40,679 --> 00:40:42,159
there isn't even enough left to pay salaries.

719
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:44,199
The finance department is always struggling.

720
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,400
If I don't find some extra income,

721
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:46,599
these brothers

722
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:47,960
will have nothing to live on.

723
00:40:48,199 --> 00:40:49,000
Besides,

724
00:40:49,559 --> 00:40:50,559
in Nanjing and Shanghai,

725
00:40:50,559 --> 00:40:51,760
which official with connections

726
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,239
isn't doing the same thing?

727
00:40:53,719 --> 00:40:54,280
You,

728
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,239
the batch of supplies you're investigating

729
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,440
isn't that just another example?

730
00:40:56,519 --> 00:40:58,400
Chongqing does it this way too.

731
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:29,800
At this moment

732
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:30,960
seeing the light of day again

733
00:41:31,079 --> 00:41:32,119
from being a prisoner

734
00:41:32,119 --> 00:41:33,599
to becoming an honored guest

735
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:35,760
Mr. Lu's current state of mind

736
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,320
must be very different now
