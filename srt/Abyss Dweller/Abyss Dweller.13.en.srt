1
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,200
How do you play this?

2
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,710
Sir.

3
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:09,680
Give it a try.

4
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:12,200
Sir.

5
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,080
What do you want to know?

6
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:13,910
I—I—I...

7
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:15,360
I'll tell you everything, everything!

8
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,710
What's this guy mumbling about?

9
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:19,800
Is he muttering curses at me?

10
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,310
Everything, I'll say everything!

11
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:23,030
He says he's willing to cooperate.

12
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,470
This...

13
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,310
It's over.

14
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,430
Well, that was boring.

15
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:39,840
Mr. Wang.

16
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:41,560
Since that's the case,

17
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,960
let's work together properly.

18
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:47,360
Yes.

19
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:52,280
I'm counting on you.

20
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,560
Takagi is a bit too arrogant.

21
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:02,680
It's common for someone from a prominent family.

22
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,870
His temperament still needs refining.

23
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:05,120
Given time, he'll become someone capable.

24
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,030
Please review the statement.

25
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,840
This Wang Qiaosu

26
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,080
has already prepared the powerful explosives from Pingjia Lane

27
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,470
and is getting ready to transport them to North Shanghai.

28
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,000
Actually, as for Pingjia Lane,

29
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,680
we've already searched it thoroughly.

30
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,030
How did the Chongqing agents

31
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:28,280
manage to hide the explosives?

32
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:34,030
What else did Wang Qiaosu confess to?

33
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:36,430
Did he reveal the contact person?

34
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:37,910
He said he doesn't know.

35
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:39,310
Because he has also been waiting

36
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:40,520
for the informant to contact him.

37
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,190
Is it Scorpio?

38
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,430
Are you trained?

39
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:48,630
Letting a post office director in charge of shipments

40
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:50,310
know so many details about the operation

41
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,800
I'm asking you.

42
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:53,910
Teacher.

43
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:55,750
Wang Qiaosu has only been arrested for now.

44
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,360
Maybe things could still turn around.

45
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,680
As long as he can hold out for two days,

46
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,280
we can make thorough preparations.

47
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,150
Your bad habit of trusting others too easily

48
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:02,800
needs to change.

49
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,000
You must always prepare for the worst.

50
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,000
Yes.

51
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:09,150
Find out everyone above and below him in the operation.

52
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:10,190
Investigate them all thoroughly.

53
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,560
If necessary,

54
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,470
you may use severe punishment.

55
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:14,240
Understood.

56
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,710
There really is something fishy going on at No. 76.

57
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:21,510
Who exactly is this person? What do you think?

58
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:24,190
In my humble opinion,

59
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:27,040
the mole is obviously Chen Gengsheng.

60
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,480
Teacher.

61
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:43,800
I thought I could at least see

62
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,920
a bit of gratitude in your eyes.

63
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,120
When you need something from others,

64
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,720
you shouldn't be so forceful.

65
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,510
Tone down your arrogance.

66
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,190
Maybe your chances of success would be higher.

67
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:57,190
I've already helped you

68
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:59,160
clean up Chen Gengsheng's mess.

69
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,630
Now you owe me a favor.

70
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:03,270
And who was the one begging me

71
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,920
to stall Hirata Xizi?

72
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,190
What's going on with you two?

73
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:11,040
I only have one reason for coming here.

74
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:14,120
It's to help you clean up this mess.

75
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,830
I still don't know

76
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,510
what mess I supposedly have.

77
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:23,240
If we assume Chen Gengsheng is the mole,

78
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:25,630
then the assassination attempt on you

79
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,720
would only speed up his exposure.

80
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:29,160
This goes against

81
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,920
the goal of sabotaging the Peace Conference.

82
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:32,510
There are still

83
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,630
many unclear points behind this matter.

84
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:36,560
We can't jump to conclusions yet.

85
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:42,000
If Chen Gengsheng is allowed to meet with Wang,

86
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,360
whether Chen Gengsheng is the mole

87
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,720
can be confirmed.

88
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,190
I will go and make arrangements for this right away.

89
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,070
Wang Qiaosu has been arrested.

90
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,390
Half of your plan has already failed.

91
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,870
As long as Mizuno Shingen interrogates Chen Gengsheng at the same time,

92
00:05:58,430 --> 00:05:59,600
not only will I be in danger,

93
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,750
all the arrangements you were once so proud of

94
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:03,040
will be destroyed in an instant.

95
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:04,720
What you are thinking now

96
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:07,000
is just to act before Wang Qiaosu

97
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,480
meets Chen Gengsheng

98
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,480
and eliminate him.

99
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:12,750
But with the current Japanese protection measures,

100
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:15,360
you have no chance at all.

101
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,600
However, if you follow my instructions,

102
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,160
there might still be a chance.

103
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:27,600
Very good.

104
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:35,430
I'm all ears.

105
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:49,830
No need to look anymore.

106
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:50,310
Thank you.

107
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:52,240
We need to use the Shanghai Military Command's radio station.

108
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,680
To send a message to Chongqing.

109
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,630
Send an ambiguous telegram.

110
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:58,950
Confirm that Chen Gengsheng and Wang Qiaosu's operations are ongoing.

111
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:00,800
Secondly,

112
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,430
Create a new

113
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:03,310
more secretive

114
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:04,750
method for Wang Qiaosu to receive intelligence.

115
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,430
To correspond with the fake telegram.

116
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,920
All it takes is a newspaper.

117
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,360
A simple word game will do the trick.

118
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,240
This is the key to sowing discord between the Japanese

119
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,120
and Wang Qiaosu.

120
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,830
And in the plan,

121
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,480
the most crucial step

122
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:23,270
is to absolutely not

123
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:25,360
let Wang Qiaosu and Chen Gengsheng meet.

124
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,800
I'll find a way to intercept Chen Gengsheng.

125
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,560
In the assassination attempt on Hirata Kiko,

126
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:32,720
there is a natural connection between Chen Gengsheng and Wang Qiaosu.

127
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,600
There is some inherent link between them.

128
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:36,040
As long as we can confirm

129
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,270
that Chen Gengsheng is Wang Qiaosu's subordinate,

130
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:40,630
it will naturally arouse the Japanese's suspicions.

131
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,950
Then the intelligence Wang Qiaosu provides

132
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,630
to the Japanese

133
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:46,480
will no longer be trustworthy.

134
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,070
Thank you.

135
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,070
Thanks.

136
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,960
We've been waiting for you.

137
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:02,910
Comrade Jingfeng

138
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,150
Comrades

139
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:06,550
Time is running out

140
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:08,240
I won't introduce everyone one by one

141
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:09,790
Comrade Fengye

142
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,270
Come, have a seat

143
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,080
Comrade Fengye

144
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:17,440
Please explain Comrade Qingshuang's action plan

145
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,750
to everyone

146
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:19,550
Alright

147
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:23,000
The operation is divided into three steps

148
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:25,080
We are responsible for the first step

149
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,600
which is also the most crucial step

150
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,240
to intercept Chen Gengsheng

151
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,910
According to the intelligence

152
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:31,750
Chen Gengsheng will be transferred from No. 76

153
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:32,960
to Meihua Hall

154
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,390
What we need to do

155
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:36,750
is to set up an ambush along the vehicle's route

156
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,440
Between No. 76 and Meihua Hall

157
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,360
there are several possible routes

158
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:42,720
How should we determine the escort route

159
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:44,150
and where should we set up the ambush

160
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:46,750
To avoid suspicion

161
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:48,670
I will not participate in escorting Chen Gengsheng

162
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,910
Other than me

163
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,790
only Cui Mo will carry out this task

164
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:53,960
Cui Mo is a cautious and suspicious person

165
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,840
and since Chen Gengsheng is a key prisoner

166
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,200
with these two factors combined

167
00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:58,790
he definitely won't choose

168
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:00,240
the two usual routes

169
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:01,790
That leaves the other two routes

170
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:03,000
No matter which one he picks

171
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,390
they both have to pass

172
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:05,390
through Wenlan Road

173
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:10,240
We've deduced the escort route

174
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,240
We'll set up the ambush at the Wenlan Road intersection

175
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,390
Mr. Takagi

176
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:26,480
Please take a seat

177
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:31,870
Mr. Takagi

178
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:32,870
Mr. Takagi, I really have already

179
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:34,030
told you everything I know.

180
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:39,670
As long as you can solve one problem,

181
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:42,270
I can let you leave here right now.

182
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,510
Okay, okay.

183
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:44,320
Please, go ahead.

184
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:48,840
You said you are the contact for Operation Scorpio.

185
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:50,720
Then you must know

186
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:54,080
who the mole he planted in the Special Agent Headquarters is.

187
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:56,320
Mr. Takagi

188
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,360
I haven't met this person either.

189
00:10:58,550 --> 00:10:59,030
I only know

190
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:00,390
he holds an important position at the Special Agent Headquarters.

191
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:01,120
Nonsense.

192
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,630
If you let me confront this person face to face,

193
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:08,840
I'm confident I can identify him.

194
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,120
Very good.

195
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,270
That's it.

196
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:14,440
Special Agent Headquarters

197
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,440
recently captured a mole.

198
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:18,030
Director Mizuno

199
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:19,840
has already ordered this person to be brought here.

200
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,840
What you need to do

201
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:24,630
is help me identify him.

202
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:27,480
If you can't identify him,

203
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:30,080
you know what will happen to you.

204
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:32,840
Don't worry,

205
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:34,960
I'll do my best, I promise.

206
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,480
According to what you said

207
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,790
this batch of high explosives

208
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:43,000
you are only responsible for the transfer in the middle

209
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,480
Yes

210
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:45,750
As long as this batch of explosives

211
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,000
can successfully enter the northern Shanghai district via the postal route

212
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,630
then the agents from the Military Command's Shanghai station

213
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:50,840
can act when the opportunity arises

214
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:52,270
The operation's code name is Snow Blindness

215
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:53,960
I suspect

216
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,120
they want to disrupt the upcoming peace conference

217
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,360
by obstructing and sabotaging it

218
00:11:58,550 --> 00:11:59,550
The code name Snow Blindness

219
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:00,790
does it have any special meaning?

220
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,360
It's an eye condition

221
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,550
People who live on snowy plains for a long time are familiar with it

222
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,360
The sunlight reflected off the snow

223
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,150
can cause temporary blindness

224
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:12,550
Temporary blindness

225
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:15,360
It seems the Military Command people are well aware

226
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:17,550
that their actions

227
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:20,600
can only have a limited effect

228
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:21,550
Of course

229
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,440
Of course

230
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,000
I believe in Mr. Takagi's great abilities

231
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,120
It won't be long

232
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,600
before we catch Scorpio

233
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,440
Call and ask

234
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,870
what time Chen Gengsheng will be brought over

235
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:31,630
Yes

236
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:36,240
About Chen Gengsheng's situation,

237
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,790
Meihua Hall already knows.

238
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:39,200
The Special Committee

239
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,390
wants us to handle the transfer properly.

240
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,440
After that,

241
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:44,120
we won't need to worry about it anymore.

242
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,240
Chen Gengsheng is one of our No. 76 people.

243
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,720
What does he have to do with Meihua Hall?

244
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,360
Didn't Meihua Hall just catch

245
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,510
a Military Statistics Bureau liaison?

246
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:54,440
They want to use him to confirm Chen Gengsheng's identity.

247
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,360
That's actually the simplest way.

248
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:58,320
Go.

249
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,120
Get all the documents ready.

250
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,440
We'll transfer the prisoner this afternoon.

251
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:02,630
By the way,

252
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:04,840
which one of you is available?

253
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,120
Go make the trip.

254
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:08,150
The credit goes to Director Liang.

255
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:09,720
I'll stay out of it.

256
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,150
Forget it.

257
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,670
Chen Gengsheng already smeared my name.

258
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:14,960
If I go again,

259
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:16,720
I'll have to explain myself all over again.

260
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:18,030
Please spare me.

261
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,030
I didn't expect

262
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,270
that Liang Shuo would be afraid sometimes too.

263
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,200
The invisible blade is the most frightening.

264
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:26,320
Brother Cui,

265
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,480
please take care of this for me.

266
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,150
The director didn't ask you to go in person.

267
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:31,840
Alright.

268
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,960
I'll have Yan Tonghai make the trip.

269
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,320
You two decide.

270
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:37,840
Director,

271
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,390
the transfer documents have arrived.

272
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:40,510
We need your signature.

273
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:45,030
This Chen Gengsheng

274
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:46,200
in prison

275
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,030
how is he doing?

276
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,390
They say he's been acting crazy the whole time.

277
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,030
No one knows if he was traumatized

278
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,320
or just pretending to be insane.

279
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,960
He even injured a guard last night.

280
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,000
He refuses to eat.

281
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:57,870
He keeps rambling nonsense.

282
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:59,000
He says he wants to see you.

283
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,080
Doesn't he seem pretty lucid?

284
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:04,320
Since Meihua Hall is in a hurry,

285
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,240
I'll trouble you two to go to the telegraph office.

286
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,550
Finish the paperwork quickly.

287
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:08,960
Then send him over directly.

288
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,120
Yes.

289
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:21,270
Meal time.

290
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:38,480
Go ahead.

291
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,840
The key.

292
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,270
Are you crazy?

293
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:50,840
What are you doing?

294
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:54,240
Liang Shuo is anti-Japanese.

295
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,440
Are you out of your mind?

296
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,440
I'm telling you,

297
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:05,120
I want to see the director.

298
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:08,240
I want to see Officer Hirata.

299
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,390
I want to see Chairman Wang.

300
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,440
Who do you think you are?

301
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:13,870
You think you can see anyone?

302
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,030
Still think you're the one in charge,

303
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:17,000
the head of the telegraph unit?

304
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,080
Nutcase.

305
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:21,360
He's lost it.

306
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:26,670
I want to see the director.

307
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:33,270
I have something to say.

308
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,080
Idiot.

309
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,480
A bunch of idiots.

310
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,360
Liang Shuo lost his mind a long time ago.

311
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:53,840
Liang Shuo can't remember anything.

312
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:07,200
This is how things turned out.

313
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:08,750
I suppose everyone is satisfied with the outcome.

314
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:10,320
Judging by what the Japanese want,

315
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:11,630
they'll have you continue to take over

316
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:13,030
the security work for the Peace Conference.

317
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:14,550
When the time comes,

318
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,750
you'll be the Director Liang of the Special Affairs Committee.

319
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,790
Don't forget to look out for us old friends.

320
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:21,390
Brother Cui, what are you saying?

321
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,150
But let's skip the congratulations.

322
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,240
What do you mean?

323
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,960
Chen Gengsheng is getting along very well with the Japanese.

324
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,030
So what?

325
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:30,080
If something goes wrong,

326
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:32,440
the Japanese never step up to say anything.

327
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:34,720
There's no need to feel sorry for a spy who gets caught.

328
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:36,200
You didn't use to

329
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:38,790
be so sentimental.

330
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,750
Brother Cui, you're still the same—

331
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,000
your words

332
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:44,840
are always worth pondering.

333
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,120
What's there to ponder?

334
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:47,910
I'm genuinely concerned about you.

335
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,150
Chief Cui,

336
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:52,320
what should we do with the codebook from the communications team?

337
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,150
How should we handle it?

338
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,000
The head of the communications team at No. 76

339
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:57,150
is an anti-Japanese element.

340
00:16:57,790 --> 00:16:59,750
Who knows how many secrets have been leaked.

341
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:00,550
If word gets out,

342
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:02,120
we'll be a laughingstock.

343
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:02,960
Just leave it for now.

344
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,240
Later, take it to the records room

345
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,000
and lock it in the safe.

346
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:05,630
Yes, sir.

347
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:13,480
Communications team

348
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,750
Each has its own unique cipher key.

349
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,160
If we can't find this cipher key,

350
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:19,590
our mission will be impossible to complete.

351
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:20,830
Brother Cui

352
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:22,240
If there's nothing else,

353
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,110
I'll be leaving now.

354
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:23,830
Don't go.

355
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,400
The escort route for Chen Gengsheng

356
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,160
let's discuss it.

357
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:28,070
Brother Cui, you handle it as you see fit.

358
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:30,160
This matter has nothing to do with me now.

359
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:32,550
The fewer people who know, the less risk.

360
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,550
You've gotten sly.

361
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,310
You want to stay out of this, don't you?

362
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,440
Thank you for your hard work, Brother Cui.

363
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:54,720
Sorry.

364
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,510
Director Liang

365
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,640
It's fine, it's fine.

366
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,440
Let me, let me, let me.

367
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:00,960
It's my fault.

368
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:02,110
I didn't see the road clearly.

369
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,400
Sorry about that.

370
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,350
It's okay, it's okay.

371
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,590
It's my fault, my fault.

372
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:08,440
Sorry to trouble you, Director Liang.

373
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:12,590
Alright.

374
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:13,270
Let me do it.

375
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,070
Thank you, Director Liang.

376
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,000
Director Lu

377
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:39,310
Director Lu

378
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:40,590
What brings you here?

379
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,400
Director Liang isn't here?

380
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:44,000
Director Liang isn't here right now.

381
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,350
Would you like to wait here for a bit,

382
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:46,070
or...

383
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:46,790
No need.

384
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:47,640
Last month,

385
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:50,070
the Dashi World shooting incident you handled,

386
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,200
the archives department said you didn't file it.

387
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,070
I'll retrieve the file.

388
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:54,640
Director Lu, there’s something you might not know.

389
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,200
Director Liang isn’t aware of these matters.

390
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,680
They’re usually handled by Captain Bai’s team.

391
00:18:58,030 --> 00:18:59,640
But Captain Bai is out for lunch right now.

392
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,830
Should I call him over now?

393
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:01,550
No need.

394
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,920
Just have him send it to my office.

395
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,160
Alright, got it.

396
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:04,920
Sorry for the trouble.

397
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:05,750
Take care.

398
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:51,070
Hurry up and go.

399
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,550
Take them out.

400
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:55,720
Yan Tonghai.

401
00:20:58,030 --> 00:20:58,720
Director Liang.

402
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,240
Heading out so early?

403
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,590
Director Cui said to bring the person over before one o'clock.

404
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:05,680
Team Leader Chen.

405
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:07,310
Sorry, I won't see you off.

406
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:09,000
Let's go.

407
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,310
Why are you whining?

408
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:13,920
Go.

409
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:16,110
Hurry up and go.

410
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:19,110
Director.

411
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:24,590
Director, you're back.

412
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:25,550
Director Lu just came looking for you.

413
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:26,400
I told him you weren't here.

414
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,640
He asked me to retrieve a file.

415
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:29,270
Which file?

416
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,510
The one Brother Bai was in charge of last month.

417
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:31,790
That minor case at the Grand World.

418
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:33,510
If he needs it,

419
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:34,590
just send it over to him.

420
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:35,510
Brother Bai already sent it.

421
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:40,550
Boss.

422
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:41,480
I've finished eating.

423
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,830
Behave yourself.

424
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:37,640
Chen,

425
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,310
when you were throwing your weight around at headquarters before,

426
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,750
did you ever think this day would come?

427
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:43,160
I want to see the director.

428
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:43,790
What?

429
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:44,790
The director.

430
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,480
You want to see the director?

431
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:48,880
The director?

432
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:50,640
You probably won't see him today.

433
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,550
You should

434
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:53,200
be ready to meet your ancestors instead.

435
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:54,510
Behave.

436
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,070
Take him up.

437
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:22,350
Everyone, get in position.

438
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,030
Get ready to start filming.

439
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:28,240
Let's go, let's go.

440
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,310
Move aside, quickly.

441
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:30,960
Move aside, quickly.

442
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:31,960
Don't block the way.

443
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:32,960
Right away, right away.

444
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:33,680
Hurry up! Are you deaf?

445
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,640
That's enough, that's enough.

446
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,400
Hurry up.

447
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,680
Lao Guan, what's going on?

448
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,720
This film crew is blocking the road.

449
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:41,110
Tell them to clear the way immediately.

450
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,200
Hurry up.

451
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:44,830
I'm talking to you.

452
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:45,680
Are you deaf?

453
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:47,440
Right away, right away.

454
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,350
We'll clear the way right now.

455
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:49,510
What's going on?

456
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:50,920
Sorry, man.

457
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,110
We dropped everything on the ground.

458
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:53,680
I'll clean it up right away so you can get through.

459
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,590
Hurry up and pick everything up.

460
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:58,070
Or I'll shoot you right now.

461
00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:00,110
Man, you have to give us a little time.

462
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:01,240
Who's in charge here?

463
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:01,790
There is.

464
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:02,480
Over there.

465
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,550
Director, director!

466
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:05,160
Director!

467
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,030
We're filming here.

468
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:07,440
What are you filming?

469
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:08,750
Let me tell you something.

470
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:10,510
Hurry up and pick everything up.

471
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:12,160
Or I'll shoot all of you.

472
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,000
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

473
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:13,640
Pick everything up.

474
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,750
Keep the cigarettes down, be careful.

475
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:15,590
Move out of the way, quickly.

476
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:16,350
Be careful.

477
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:17,640
Quick, move the equipment.

478
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,590
Hurry, stop lighting cigarettes.

479
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:19,510
Put them out, put them out.

480
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:20,510
Hurry up, put out the cigarettes.

481
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:21,440
Put out the cigarettes.

482
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,200
Take the cigarettes away.

483
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,440
Take the cigarettes away, farther away.

484
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,480
Lao Guan, tell them to take the cigarettes away.

485
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,270
If you don't move them, I'll start shooting.

486
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,480
Old Guan

487
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:48,720
What's going on here?

488
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:50,240
I don't know either.

489
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,550
The route was all set in advance.

490
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:52,590
No one knows.

491
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:53,400
Where is he?

492
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,510
Go find him for me.

493
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:55,790
Hurry up and look!

494
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:56,830
Yes.

495
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:02,400
Hello?

496
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:03,310
Yes.

497
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:04,200
This is.

498
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:05,440
W-what?

499
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,640
Alright, I got it.

500
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:10,070
Immediately notify the patrols to lock down the surrounding area.

501
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:11,790
Don't let even a fly get through.

502
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:14,440
Secretary Wang

503
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:15,750
Director

504
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,000
Have Cui Mo come over right away.

505
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,640
Call Liang Shuo over too.

506
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:20,590
Yes.

507
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:21,030
Director

508
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:21,920
You are...

509
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:23,030
Chen Gengsheng

510
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,790
was ambushed halfway.

511
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:25,590
Yes.

512
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,480
Chen Gengsheng was arrested that day.

513
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:54,750
We all believed

514
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:56,550
he was the Chongqing agent.

515
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,030
He was rescued today.

516
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,000
This further confirmed our previous suspicions.

517
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:02,440
I really didn't expect this.

518
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,880
That the Military Bureau would act so quickly.

519
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:08,070
How, in such a short time,

520
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:11,720
did the anti-Japanese agents get such accurate information?

521
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:13,830
The time and place of the ambush

522
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:15,400
were also perfectly chosen.

523
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,270
In my opinion,

524
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,240
the Special Operations Headquarters

525
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,680
really needs a thorough reorganization.

526
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:25,350
Director Li,

527
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:26,440
this is

528
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,920
the new deputy captain

529
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,240
of our Military Police unit,

530
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:30,640
Takagi Yuyi.

531
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,750
The escort personnel and route

532
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,590
all came from No. 76.

533
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:36,830
Regarding this matter,

534
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:39,880
the Special Operations Headquarters must give Chief Mizuno

535
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,550
a reasonable explanation.

536
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:46,200
As for the escort route and timing,

537
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:49,200
they were also reported in advance to Deputy Captain Takagi.

538
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:53,640
Alright.

539
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:56,790
Now is not the time to shift responsibility.

540
00:26:57,110 --> 00:26:58,200
It's meaningless.

541
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,640
Here, on our side,

542
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:01,440
I will, of course, conduct a thorough investigation.

543
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:03,830
Director Cui,

544
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:06,750
The escorting personnel are your trusted subordinates.

545
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:09,270
The escort route was also arranged by you.

546
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:11,480
How this account will be settled

547
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,750
I'll settle it with you later.

548
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,440
I've already ordered Director Liang

549
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,400
to impose martial law within

550
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,510
five kilometers of the incident site.

551
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,110
Even if they want to escape,

552
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:25,590
I'm afraid it won't be that easy.

553
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:26,680
Very good.

554
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:28,070
I'll go along.

555
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,110
Takagi Yuyi,

556
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:33,550
do you think things aren't chaotic enough already?

557
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,400
I'll bring Wang Qiaosu with me.

558
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:36,640
If Chen Gengsheng

559
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,310
was really taken by the military intelligence,

560
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:40,960
he should be able to find useful clues.

561
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:46,000
At least I can give the chief an explanation.

562
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:50,510
Sir.

563
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:14,680
Please come in.

564
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:21,920
I heard Director Lu wanted to see me.

565
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:23,350
Please have a seat.

566
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:24,480
Miss Hirata,

567
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,350
you should at least address me as

568
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:29,640
"Sir," shouldn't you?

569
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,440
Director Lu,

570
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,920
born in China, the land of etiquette,

571
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:35,350
such basic manners

572
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:36,790
haven't you learned them?

573
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,000
Miss Hirata, please don't misunderstand.

574
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:42,960
I have no intention

575
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:44,680
of disrespecting your position.

576
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:48,200
As you command.

577
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:56,350
I think a person's name and title

578
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:58,400
are nothing more than symbols.

579
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,110
Since they're just symbols,

580
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:01,400
there's no need to care about them.

581
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,160
This document shows

582
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:06,720
that before Yan Jiu left Shanghai,

583
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,510
he once

584
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:09,550
renovated the Pingjia Lane warehouse.

585
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,310
Miss Hirata,

586
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:13,480
have you investigated this before?

587
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:15,590
It seems that Mr. Mizuno

588
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,310
asked Director Lu

589
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:18,400
to investigate this matter,

590
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,920
and now there are results.

591
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,070
However,

592
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:25,240
we already conducted a thorough investigation here

593
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:27,350
and found nothing.

594
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,920
Director Lu, you’re not trying to tell me

595
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,590
that this is your investigation result, are you?

596
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:40,920
I have here

597
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:44,550
the renovation records for the Pingjia Lane warehouse.

598
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,200
These documents

599
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,790
have already been investigated by us.

600
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:52,790
The reason we focused on Pingjia Lane

601
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:55,400
was also because of these.

602
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:58,200
Miss Hirata, please take another close look

603
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,200
at this record.

604
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,510
Construction crew

605
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,440
Specifically used two trucks

606
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,750
to transport sand and soil

607
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:09,200
For regular repairs

608
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:11,030
there wouldn't be so much sand and soil

609
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:15,240
You mean

610
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:16,880
Yan Jiu

611
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,110
buried explosives

612
00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:19,200
underground

613
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:20,400
It's very likely

614
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:22,310
But what's strange is

615
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,720
when we searched

616
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,160
the warehouse

617
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:26,550
we didn't find

618
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:27,550
a secret room

619
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:30,000
or any sign of a basement

620
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,000
Maybe the Pingjia Lane warehouse

621
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:34,350
is just a cover

622
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,240
What will you do

623
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,440
I'll go to the Pingjia Lane warehouse again

624
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:41,790
and investigate secretly

625
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:43,750
By the way

626
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,310
I forgot to tell Miss Hirata

627
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:48,030
this document

628
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:50,480
was intercepted from Director Liang

629
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,270
Director Lu

630
00:30:57,030 --> 00:30:58,310
There's a hidden meaning in your words.

631
00:30:59,270 --> 00:31:01,200
Whatever Director Hirata thinks,

632
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,550
that's how it will be.

633
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,640
As for this matter,

634
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:07,000
Liang Shuo did handle it before.

635
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:08,270
But in the meantime,

636
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,240
many unexpected changes occurred.

637
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,510
Yan Jiu died at Yulong Mountain.

638
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:13,440
Liang Shuo

639
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,350
was also forced to investigate.

640
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:16,680
The clues

641
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,480
naturally got cut off.

642
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,680
It seems Director Hirata

643
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:24,640
trusts Director Liang a lot.

644
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,680
What do you mean?

645
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,720
Nothing.

646
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:34,790
Then I'll leave it to you.

647
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:35,720
Director Lu

648
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:38,510
Let me know immediately if there's any news.

649
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:53,830
This is the Military Command's assembly mark.

650
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:54,960
The direction of the arrow

651
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:56,160
indicates the location.

652
00:31:58,350 --> 00:31:59,440
The current direction

653
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:01,070
is wrong.

654
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:01,960
Sir

655
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,400
they retreated to the north.

656
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:04,960
But according to the investigation,

657
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:05,830
What do you know?

658
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:08,350
They deliberately made the mark point the other way

659
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:09,720
to make us mistakenly think

660
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:10,960
they retreated to the south.

661
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:11,510
You

662
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:12,680
go check the surroundings

663
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,240
and see if there are any similar marks.

664
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:15,160
I

665
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:15,880
Report

666
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:17,480
Director Liang has found something here.

667
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:23,480
Where?

668
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,310
That's right.

669
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:27,590
Sir.

670
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:29,110
They definitely ran north.

671
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:30,880
The area is already under lockdown.

672
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:31,960
As long as we investigate along the way,

673
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,070
we'll definitely catch them.

674
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,160
Send people to search the streets immediately.

675
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:38,920
Don't miss any corners.

676
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:39,480
Yes, sir.

677
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,110
Everyone, get in the vehicles.

678
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:42,510
Tonight,

679
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:45,350
I want to catch the big fish behind Chen Gengsheng.

680
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:48,110
Mr. Wang, join the team.

681
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:49,640
There shouldn't be any objections, right?

682
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:50,640
No problem.

683
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,550
What about Director Liang?

684
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:55,790
Captain Takagi will go ahead.

685
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:57,750
I need to return to headquarters to report to the chief.

686
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,440
Director Liang is hesitating.

687
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,030
He might miss the chance to make a big contribution.

688
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:11,480
Boss, what should we do?

689
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,510
Take some men and follow Takagi Yuyi.

690
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:14,310
Don't show yourselves.

691
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:15,590
Just act according to the situation.

692
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:16,550
Understood.

693
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:17,880
Guangzhi, let's go.

694
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:21,880
You go back to headquarters.

695
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:24,240
Just say that Wang Qiaosu has found the location of the military command.

696
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:25,480
Take the military police to make the arrest.

697
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:26,680
We'll assist when the time is right.

698
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:27,880
Yes.

699
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,550
Give me the car keys.

700
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:31,590
Director, where are you going?

701
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:32,110
Should I give you a ride?

702
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:33,310
I'm going to look around the area.

703
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,160
See if there's any unexpected gain.

704
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,070
Alright.

705
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:08,510
Move faster.

706
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:10,030
Put it on top.

707
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:22,840
Why are you here?

708
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:24,630
The Japanese still don't know.

709
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:26,280
They think we took Chen Gengsheng.

710
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,550
They're following the marks I left.

711
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:28,760
They've already arrived nearby.

712
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:29,550
Okay.

713
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:30,590
Hurry.

714
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:32,670
Send out the decoy.

715
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:33,550
Lure them over here.

716
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:34,320
Yes.

717
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,550
I'll go set the countdown.

718
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:36,550
Alright.

719
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:40,150
Then you should leave quickly.

720
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:45,880
Once Wang Qiaosu is eliminated,

721
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:48,360
all obstacles before the Snow Blind Plan

722
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,590
will have been cleared.

723
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,400
Your mission will also be complete.

724
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:52,840
If possible,

725
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,400
leave Shanghai.

726
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:56,630
Why?

727
00:34:57,150 --> 00:34:58,400
After the Peace Conference,

728
00:34:58,590 --> 00:35:00,360
the situation in Shanghai will change dramatically.

729
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:02,800
As for what kind of upheaval will happen,

730
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:04,360
no one can predict it.

731
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:06,920
That includes you.

732
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,480
As long as Scorpio keeps their promise,

733
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:11,150
you'll regain your freedom.

734
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:15,070
You really are persistent.

735
00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:20,840
I've always wanted to say

736
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:23,760
thank you.

737
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,110
We're partners.

738
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:28,320
No need to thank me.

739
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:30,590
Your situation is different from mine now.

740
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,280
You're in more danger than I am.

741
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,960
Before you regain your freedom,

742
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,190
you need to protect yourself.

743
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:38,630
Go, quickly.

744
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:15,960
Finally showed up.

745
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:17,190
Drive quickly.

746
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:18,920
Go full speed ahead.

747
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:19,480
Yes, sir.

748
00:36:47,110 --> 00:36:47,800
Here.

749
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:54,800
The Japanese soldiers are almost here.

750
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:55,360
Retreat quickly.

751
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:55,840
Hurry up and go.

752
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:56,480
Okay.

753
00:36:57,070 --> 00:36:57,630
Let's go.

754
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:00,190
Hurry.

755
00:37:01,030 --> 00:37:01,590
Quickly.

756
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:22,110
Sir.

757
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,920
The scene is already sealed off.

758
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:24,880
Where are they?

759
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:25,630
Reporting, Captain.

760
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:26,920
We chased them to this spot.

761
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:27,670
They've already disappeared.

762
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:31,960
Why is there a car here?

763
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:34,440
It seems the anti-Japanese agents left it behind in a hurry.

764
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:36,400
We also found a lot of materials.

765
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:41,400
Wang Qiaosu.

766
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:42,070
Here.

767
00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:46,000
What's with this car?

768
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:47,800
I'll go take a look.

769
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:02,000
Mr. Takagi.

770
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:03,840
It looks like they were transporting something.

771
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:04,920
What were they carrying?

772
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:06,590
Pry it open and check.

773
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:32,800
It's about to explode!

774
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:37,630
Wait!

775
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:38,840
Everyone, quiet.

776
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:44,710
It's a bomb!

777
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:45,360
Get out of the way!

778
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:56,920
Move aside, quickly!

779
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,760
My hand

780
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:44,110
My leg

781
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:45,590
It hurts so much

782
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,550
It hurts like hell

783
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:56,800
Pain

784
00:39:57,550 --> 00:39:58,920
It hurts too much

785
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,320
Mom

786
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,670
Dad

787
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:06,920
I want to go home

788
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:15,510
This is outrageous

789
00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:32,510
If you do this, you'll kill him

790
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:42,840
Go

791
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:44,510
Go

792
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:12,920
Liang Shuo, what are you trying to do?

793
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:14,480
Why are you blocking the doorway?

794
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:17,920
I should be asking you what's going on

795
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,150
Why is this happening?

796
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:23,190
Weren't you here to arrest the military agents?

797
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,800
You dare question me?

798
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,110
Takagi

799
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,920
What are you doing?

800
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,030
Let Director Liang go, now

801
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:35,230
What's going on here?

802
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,630
Can't you see for yourself?

803
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:38,550
What kind of attitude is that?

804
00:41:42,070 --> 00:41:44,110
Go rescue the wounded immediately

805
00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:44,960
Go

806
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:47,000
No need

807
00:41:48,190 --> 00:41:52,280
The remaining anti-Japanese elements are still nearby

808
00:41:52,590 --> 00:41:53,920
Hurry up and search
