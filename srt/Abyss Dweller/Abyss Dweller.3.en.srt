1
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:13,199
I must find evidence of Jin Pangzi's corruption.

2
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,199
Selling cigarettes

3
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,120
Selling cigarettes

4
00:03:58,199 --> 00:03:59,240
Come and get a hat

5
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,439
No need to look for change

6
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,199
The figure looks a bit similar

7
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:06,960
But

8
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,000
I can't see the face clearly

9
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,639
I need to get a little closer

10
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:10,599
You two go

11
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:12,639
Don't get spotted

12
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,159
Yes

13
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:28,680
Old Tan, tell me

14
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,040
Comrade Fengye

15
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:33,120
how exactly did he die?

16
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,560
He fled to the Northeast

17
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,879
and was arrested by agents from No. 76

18
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:40,319
Later

19
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,800
while being transported

20
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,920
an accident occurred

21
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,360
According to reliable intelligence

22
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,639
the Japanese and No. 76

23
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:50,959
are both investigating this matter

24
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,199
There is also news that

25
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:54,720
the assassin who killed Fengye

26
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,600
has already returned to Shanghai

27
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,639
Is that so?

28
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:00,519
Comrade Feiman

29
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:02,319
Fortunately, we have your Pingchuan Academy

30
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:04,279
constantly delivering important information for us

31
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:06,360
Please make sure to find this person

32
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,720
You know

33
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,199
when Comrade Fengye was alive

34
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,120
he was always dedicated to rescuing refugees

35
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,079
and supporting the anti-Japanese rear

36
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:14,560
by transporting supplies

37
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,279
He purchased a large batch of sulfa drugs

38
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:18,079
Now

39
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:19,959
the whereabouts of these supplies are unknown

40
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:21,920
We must find this person

41
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,000
to have a chance of finding the supplies

42
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:26,759
I understand

43
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:27,680
I heard

44
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,279
at the Ruijin Building

45
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:30,759
this person was spotted

46
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:31,959
This shows

47
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,920
he is also searching for these supplies

48
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:35,800
Old Tan

49
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,759
Don't worry

50
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,000
Comrade Fengye will not have died in vain

51
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,959
I will keep a close eye on this matter

52
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,759
Move forward

53
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,320
He actually got away.

54
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,240
Useless.

55
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,440
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

56
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,360
Such an opponent...

57
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,679
It's been a long time.

58
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,360
Expand the search perimeter.

59
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:41,679
We must.

60
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,080
Catch him.

61
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:43,759
Yes.

62
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,159
In the end, he

63
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,200
left from here.

64
00:08:56,159 --> 00:08:57,679
What confuses me most is

65
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:01,559
what exactly he discovered.

66
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,799
Warehouse No. 17, Pingjia Lane

67
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,480
Ruijin Pharmaceuticals

68
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:23,559
Key

69
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:33,919
Useless

70
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:38,320
So many people

71
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,039
We've searched for so long and found nothing

72
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:42,360
Yet he managed to find it

73
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:43,679
Sir

74
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:44,919
At this point

75
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,600
We can only investigate further

76
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,840
Under Yan Jiu's name

77
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,399
What other hidden assets are there

78
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,159
Alright

79
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,000
Then go check immediately

80
00:10:57,759 --> 00:10:58,559
Yes

81
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:09,559
What's the situation

82
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,000
There are patrols outside

83
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:11,759
What about inside

84
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,039
It's still unclear inside

85
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,399
We can't force our way in

86
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:16,000
We have to go in, whether we want to or not

87
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:18,440
This is an order from the teacher

88
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,320
It must be completed

89
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,039
Senior brother

90
00:11:20,039 --> 00:11:21,720
Why is this mission so rushed

91
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:22,840
Don't ask so many questions

92
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,519
Xiao Si

93
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,799
In a bit, you'll stay outside

94
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:25,679
Be in charge of keeping watch

95
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:26,440
And providing backup

96
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:27,960
After the mission is complete

97
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,279
We'll meet at the agreed location

98
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:33,960
Brother

99
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,039
I'll go with you

100
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,240
Carry out the order

101
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:38,200
Notify Chief Hirata.

102
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,879
Ma Yuan's house.

103
00:12:40,039 --> 00:12:41,279
The fish has taken the bait.

104
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,080
Captain.

105
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:00,919
No one.

106
00:13:00,919 --> 00:13:02,600
Looks like no one has lived here for a long time.

107
00:13:03,559 --> 00:13:04,519
Since we're here,

108
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,000
we can't leave empty-handed.

109
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,600
Search.

110
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,440
Sir.

111
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:21,159
According to the intel,

112
00:13:21,159 --> 00:13:22,320
the contact has arrived.

113
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:31,720
That's a quick response.

114
00:13:33,399 --> 00:13:37,120
Looks like someone is getting anxious.

115
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,799
Move out.

116
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:39,320
Yes, sir.

117
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,320
Follow me.

118
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:50,759
Go.

119
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,240
Why are you here?

120
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,440
I saw Japanese agents coming.

121
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:08,080
Retreat quickly!

122
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,360
If we don't leave now, it'll be too late.

123
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,559
You go first.

124
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:13,200
Take the information about what's happening here out.

125
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:13,919
Tell Old Xie.

126
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:15,480
Tell him Ma Yuan has already left Shanghai.

127
00:15:15,639 --> 00:15:16,440
What about you?

128
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,600
We'll find a way to get out.

129
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,159
Hurry!

130
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:23,720
There's no time!

131
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:43,279
Get down!

132
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:48,679
Xiao Si

133
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:49,559
Retreat quickly!

134
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,079
Xiao Si

135
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,200
Go up!

136
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,119
Come!

137
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,079
Cover it!

138
00:17:28,279 --> 00:17:28,960
Brother

139
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:30,119
Were we betrayed?

140
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:32,400
Otherwise, the Japanese couldn't have arrived so quickly.

141
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,200
No way.

142
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,920
The teacher wouldn't make a mistake.

143
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,480
There's no time.

144
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,480
You go, quickly!

145
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:43,759
Brother

146
00:17:43,759 --> 00:17:44,880
Take me with you.

147
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,519
Don't leave me to the Japanese.

148
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:47,759
Don't!

149
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:49,559
Hurry!

150
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,319
Hurry up!

151
00:17:52,759 --> 00:17:53,680
Okay.

152
00:17:55,599 --> 00:17:56,480
I'll take you.

153
00:18:20,519 --> 00:18:21,440
Surround him!

154
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:49,200
Bastard!

155
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:56,640
Stop resisting.

156
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:57,880
It's useless.

157
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:03,319
Take him back for interrogation.

158
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,440
Come in.

159
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,480
Teacher

160
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,680
A telegram from Shanghai.

161
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,559
Lu Xijian was captured by the Japanese.

162
00:19:38,519 --> 00:19:39,440
Was he injured?

163
00:19:40,119 --> 00:19:41,000
He was shot in the leg.

164
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,000
Except for Xiao Si,

165
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,759
no one else made it back.

166
00:19:44,839 --> 00:19:45,640
That's all.

167
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,039
Teacher

168
00:19:48,359 --> 00:19:49,640
What should we do next?

169
00:19:52,119 --> 00:19:53,359
Let's wait and see.

170
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:57,559
Have you contacted Shadow?

171
00:19:59,079 --> 00:20:00,240
Not yet.

172
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:06,240
This game in Shanghai

173
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,000
is getting bigger and bigger.

174
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,839
It's our turn now.

175
00:20:12,599 --> 00:20:13,680
I'll arrange it right away.

176
00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:45,319
Team Leader Chen

177
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:47,400
Working hard here, I see.

178
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,240
Yes.

179
00:20:49,559 --> 00:20:50,359
How's it going?

180
00:20:50,519 --> 00:20:52,000
Have you figured anything out?

181
00:20:58,920 --> 00:20:59,720
Here.

182
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,759
Hasn't this already been checked?

183
00:21:03,799 --> 00:21:04,720
Travel records.

184
00:21:04,759 --> 00:21:05,559
What's wrong?

185
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,000
Over a hundred trip records.

186
00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:09,759
Either departing from Tailong Chamber of Commerce,

187
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,839
or from Ruijin Building.

188
00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:15,759
The destinations are really all over the place.

189
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:16,759
Some are in West Shanghai,

190
00:21:16,759 --> 00:21:17,920
some are in North Shanghai.

191
00:21:18,359 --> 00:21:20,000
The farthest even goes to Suzhou.

192
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,200
Isn't this just a simple travel log?

193
00:21:22,599 --> 00:21:23,640
What can you possibly see from this?

194
00:21:24,599 --> 00:21:25,799
Just ordinary trip records.

195
00:21:25,799 --> 00:21:27,279
Why hide them so carefully then?

196
00:21:29,559 --> 00:21:30,400
Here's what we'll do, Director Cui.

197
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:32,519
Tell me the destination and starting point for each trip.

198
00:21:32,519 --> 00:21:33,440
Let me know all of them.

199
00:21:34,599 --> 00:21:35,480
Ruijin Hospital.

200
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,759
Hetou Alley entrance.

201
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,440
Ruijin Hospital.

202
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,839
77 Yuyuan Road.

203
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:46,039
Tailong Chamber of Commerce.

204
00:21:46,039 --> 00:21:47,240
11 Liu'an Bridge.

205
00:21:48,839 --> 00:21:49,559
Tailong Chamber of Commerce.

206
00:21:49,559 --> 00:21:50,359
Datie Lane.

207
00:21:50,359 --> 00:21:51,599
No. 184.

208
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,880
They all pass through this place.

209
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:04,160
The place he really wants to go

210
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,240
is Pingjia Lane.

211
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,160
These are all fine porcelain pieces.

212
00:22:44,599 --> 00:22:46,119
If you break them, your wages will be docked.

213
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:48,759
The same goes for you.

214
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,960
If you break them, your wages will be docked as well.

215
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:33,880
Lao Wang

216
00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:38,319
Lao Wang

217
00:23:38,599 --> 00:23:39,279
What's wrong?

218
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,279
A piece of porcelain

219
00:23:40,279 --> 00:23:40,960
got broken.

220
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:42,039
It's broken.

221
00:24:17,359 --> 00:24:18,160
Uncle

222
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,599
What is that?

223
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,559
That's the Big Dipper.

224
00:24:21,839 --> 00:24:22,759
And the Big Dipper,

225
00:24:22,759 --> 00:24:23,599
is made up of

226
00:24:24,039 --> 00:24:24,920
Tianshu,

227
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:25,880
Tianxuan,

228
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:26,759
Tianji,

229
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:27,920
Tianquan,

230
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:28,839
Yuheng,

231
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:30,680
Kaiyang, and Yaoguang.

232
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:31,519
Look,

233
00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:33,519
doesn't it look like a little ladle?

234
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:34,680
It really does.

235
00:24:35,559 --> 00:24:36,440
What about over there?

236
00:24:36,519 --> 00:24:38,119
There's another star.

237
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,119
It's so bright.

238
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,039
That's the Ziwei Star.

239
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:42,759
They are always opposite each other.

240
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:43,680
Ahan,

241
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,559
remember this.

242
00:24:44,839 --> 00:24:45,920
If you ever get lost,

243
00:24:46,279 --> 00:24:47,440
the Ziwei Star

244
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,640
will always guide us.

245
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:21,599
Sir

246
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,160
We've found it.

247
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,519
There really is a warehouse at Pingjia Lane.

248
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,960
It's indeed Yan Jiu's secret property.

249
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:31,400
Search and seize the Pingjia Lane warehouse immediately.

250
00:25:35,799 --> 00:25:36,519
Search it for me.

251
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,039
Team Leader Chen

252
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:40,240
Are you sure about this Pingjia Lane

253
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,480
really being suspicious?

254
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44,480
All the goods from Tailong Chamber of Commerce

255
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:49,720
and Ruijin Building

256
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:52,160
are transferred here.

257
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:55,759
There must be something fishy.

258
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,279
Who taught you Japanese?

259
00:25:59,079 --> 00:26:00,160
I taught myself.

260
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,319
This Yan Jiu

261
00:26:02,319 --> 00:26:04,599
probably knew a long time ago

262
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,920
that we were watching him.

263
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,240
I heard

264
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:12,119
Team Leader Chen is quite interested in the position at the Central Executive Committee's Special Investigation Division.

265
00:26:12,119 --> 00:26:13,640
is quite interested.

266
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:15,079
If today

267
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,960
you can find the whereabouts of the assassin and the explosives,

268
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,279
you can expect good news.

269
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:23,799
Thank you for your support, sir.

270
00:26:47,599 --> 00:26:48,440
Sir

271
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,200
There's a locked storeroom here.

272
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:52,359
Open the door for me.

273
00:26:52,359 --> 00:26:53,039
Yes, sir.

274
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:45,759
Sir

275
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,559
Someone has been here

276
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,599
He left through here

277
00:27:53,359 --> 00:27:54,799
Before that guy escapes

278
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:55,640
Seal off the entire street

279
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,240
Yes, sir

280
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,200
Everyone

281
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,079
Assemble quickly

282
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:58,799
Yes, sir

283
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,000
That damn fatso

284
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,599
is really insatiable.

285
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,160
Nothing was found.

286
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:41,960
Team Leader Chen.

287
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,240
You were the one who suggested investigating Pingjia Alley.

288
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,799
Given the current situation,

289
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,559
the intelligence shouldn't be wrong.

290
00:31:49,079 --> 00:31:49,880
This Yan Jiu

291
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,599
must have hidden the materials.

292
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,559
Team Leader Chen, you are quite confident.

293
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,119
Sir,

294
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,480
please believe me.

295
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,559
This batch of materials

296
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:00,480
was probably moved temporarily before Yan Jiu left Shanghai.

297
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,839
It was temporarily relocated.

298
00:32:02,319 --> 00:32:03,640
But it can't be too far.

299
00:32:04,319 --> 00:32:05,359
I suggest

300
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:08,480
that you station a squad of military police nearby.

301
00:32:08,839 --> 00:32:09,680
That way,

302
00:32:09,799 --> 00:32:12,000
even if the anti-Japanese elements find out where the explosives are,

303
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,200
they won't be able to transport them out.

304
00:32:15,599 --> 00:32:17,000
That's all we can do for now.

305
00:32:18,759 --> 00:32:19,640
Then we'll

306
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:23,319
leave a covert sentry behind.

307
00:32:23,319 --> 00:32:24,359
The rest will withdraw.

308
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:24,880
Yes, sir.

309
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:25,359
Let's go.

310
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,799
What exactly is the purpose of these explosives?

311
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:44,440
And what do they have to do with me?

312
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,559
Who am I, really?

313
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,640
Why did Yan Jiu leave me clues?

314
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,240
And who is Yan Jiu?

315
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,519
Where are the items?

316
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,079
Where are the items?

317
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,519
Master Jiu.

318
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:08,839
Go find them.

319
00:33:09,799 --> 00:33:10,839
The key.

320
00:33:17,559 --> 00:33:18,359
Brother

321
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,359
What exactly do you do?

322
00:33:21,839 --> 00:33:22,880
If it's convenient,

323
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,279
leave your name.

324
00:33:24,279 --> 00:33:25,599
So we can meet again in the future.

325
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,160
My name is...

326
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,079
How about it?

327
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:48,079
No.

328
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:49,640
Continue.

329
00:33:49,759 --> 00:33:50,200
Yes.

330
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:51,000
You two,

331
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:51,480
over there.

332
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,240
Yes.

333
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:20,760
Keep a close watch for me.

334
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,159
You take this area.

335
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:22,480
Yes.

336
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,559
You take this area.

337
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:23,960
Alright.

338
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:25,559
If this doesn't work out this time,

339
00:34:25,559 --> 00:34:26,920
don't bother coming back to see me.

340
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:27,440
Go.

341
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,199
Yes.

342
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:28,760
Let's go.

343
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,679
Starting today,

344
00:34:38,039 --> 00:34:40,679
you can officially walk in the sunlight.

345
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:41,840
Go to work.

346
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:42,800
Go live your life.

347
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:43,960
You must be clear

348
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:45,280
about what your mission is.

349
00:34:45,519 --> 00:34:46,480
Complete it.

350
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,760
Do your utmost.

351
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,960
Even if it costs your life.

352
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,280
Hey.

353
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:57,599
What's wrong with you?

354
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:58,840
Are you okay?

355
00:35:02,519 --> 00:35:03,320
I...

356
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,239
You're hurt.

357
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:16,519
I can feel it.

358
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,599
This person is near me.

359
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:22,199
But every time, I’m just a little bit off.

360
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:24,920
An excellent hunter

361
00:35:25,719 --> 00:35:27,480
is often more patient than the prey.

362
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,559
has even more patience.

363
00:35:32,239 --> 00:35:33,239
At this point,

364
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:35,079
if we want to catch that assassin,

365
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:38,480
I’m afraid

366
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,000
we’ll need a bit of luck.

367
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,039
I’d like to hear more.

368
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:44,960
In my judgment,

369
00:35:45,239 --> 00:35:47,199
the other side must still be trying

370
00:35:47,239 --> 00:35:49,159
to get clues from Yan Jiu.

371
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,599
I have an idea.

372
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,440
Please, go ahead.

373
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,639
Then I’ll speak frankly.

374
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:58,280
I’ll send the obituary from the Yan residence

375
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,760
to the newspaper right away.

376
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,320
Do as you suggest.

377
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,280
Yes.

378
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,880
Starting today,

379
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,719
you officially graduate from here.

380
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:14,480
It also means that from today on,

381
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:17,400
you can walk openly in the sunlight.

382
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:19,800
You have an identity and a name.

383
00:36:20,039 --> 00:36:21,320
Go to work.

384
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,480
Go live your life.

385
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,320
The mission.

386
00:36:23,519 --> 00:36:24,920
You must be clear

387
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:25,920
about what the mission is.

388
00:36:26,719 --> 00:36:27,559
Complete it.

389
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,039
Do your utmost.

390
00:36:29,199 --> 00:36:31,079
Even if it costs your life.

391
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,119
Who exactly are you?

392
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,320
You say you’re not Japanese,

393
00:36:36,559 --> 00:36:38,559
but you speak Japanese so well.

394
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,079
You scoundrel!

395
00:36:42,199 --> 00:36:43,880
Everyone should punish you.

396
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,480
You're awake.

397
00:38:08,639 --> 00:38:09,760
You saved me.

398
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Who else would it be?

399
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,320
Where is this place?

400
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,760
A shabby little inn.

401
00:38:18,519 --> 00:38:19,599
A shabby little inn?

402
00:38:20,239 --> 00:38:22,320
It's just a dirty, messy little hotel.

403
00:38:22,559 --> 00:38:23,800
This is the shantytown.

404
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,280
The security here is terrible.

405
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,480
The Japanese military police would never come here.

406
00:38:28,199 --> 00:38:29,280
If it weren't for you,

407
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,400
I probably wouldn't have come here either.

408
00:38:33,039 --> 00:38:33,639
It's really filthy.

409
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:36,719
Filthy.

410
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:39,559
Yeah.

411
00:38:40,519 --> 00:38:42,159
The people who come here are all kinds of...

412
00:38:42,159 --> 00:38:43,360
Men and women.

413
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:45,000
When I helped you in just now,

414
00:38:46,039 --> 00:38:47,400
the owner's look at me

415
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,480
was really strange.

416
00:38:49,519 --> 00:38:50,880
He probably thought I was one of them too.

417
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:54,039
Sorry about that.

418
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,199
There's nothing to be sorry for.

419
00:38:58,079 --> 00:38:59,039
You were hurt.

420
00:38:59,239 --> 00:39:00,360
We had to do what we could in an emergency.

421
00:39:00,639 --> 00:39:02,039
Besides, you saved me before.

422
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:03,559
So I consider this repaying you.

423
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,679
We've met so many times,

424
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,320
but I still don't know your name.

425
00:39:11,159 --> 00:39:12,320
What's your name?

426
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:17,599
I don't remember.

427
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:21,400
Before you passed out,

428
00:39:21,639 --> 00:39:22,760
you kept asking me,

429
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:23,920
"Who are you?"

430
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,239
"Can I trust you?"

431
00:39:35,199 --> 00:39:36,159
Let me put it this way.

432
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,039
The two of us

433
00:39:38,039 --> 00:39:39,559
both hate the Japanese.

434
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:42,039
So from a certain perspective,

435
00:39:42,239 --> 00:39:43,519
we're comrades.

436
00:39:43,719 --> 00:39:44,440
Right?

437
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,000
I can remember some things,

438
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,519
but a lot of things about myself

439
00:39:59,719 --> 00:40:00,639
like my name,

440
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:02,800
who I am,

441
00:40:04,679 --> 00:40:05,719
my identity,

442
00:40:06,239 --> 00:40:07,239
my family,

443
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,320
my friends,

444
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,599
what I've done—

445
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,440
I have no memory of any of it.

446
00:40:15,159 --> 00:40:16,960
There are only some images and fragments,

447
00:40:18,639 --> 00:40:20,559
but I can't connect them.

448
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:23,960
It's because

449
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,760
of the injury on my head.

450
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:28,599
A bullet fragment is still lodged in my brain.

451
00:40:30,239 --> 00:40:31,199
Sometimes I'm confused,

452
00:40:31,199 --> 00:40:32,280
sometimes I'm clear-headed.

453
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,679
I just remembered this.

454
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,239
This pattern.

455
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:51,960
I—

456
00:40:52,039 --> 00:40:53,039
You recognize it?

457
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,239
I do.

458
00:40:54,639 --> 00:40:56,440
My father had a pocket watch

459
00:40:56,679 --> 00:40:58,280
with this pattern on it.

460
00:40:59,159 --> 00:41:01,119
But I don't know what it means.

461
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,760
And your father was...?

462
00:41:04,159 --> 00:41:05,880
My father was a soldier.

463
00:41:06,039 --> 00:41:08,159
He died when I was very young.

464
00:41:09,239 --> 00:41:10,440
You recognize this pattern,

465
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,079
and you're so skilled.

466
00:41:12,559 --> 00:41:13,440
Have you ever thought

467
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,280
that your identity

468
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:16,199
might be connected to Chongqing?

469
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:22,800
Maybe.

470
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,840
Do you have any way to prove it?

471
00:41:28,199 --> 00:41:29,000
Sorry.

472
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:30,280
I really want to help you.

473
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,559
But I can barely protect myself right now.

474
00:41:32,559 --> 00:41:33,960
I can't go back at all.

475
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:36,000
Then...

476
00:41:38,039 --> 00:41:38,679
Yes.

477
00:41:39,559 --> 00:41:41,400
This was my own problem to begin with.

478
00:41:42,239 --> 00:41:44,239
So what do you plan to do next?

479
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:47,679
I want to investigate Yan Jiu again.

480
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,440
I've run out of leads for now.

481
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,639
Maybe with Yan Jiu,

482
00:41:53,039 --> 00:41:54,840
there are clues about my identity.
