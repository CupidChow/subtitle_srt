1
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,439
Excuse me, please make way.

2
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,280
Cigarettes.

3
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,719
Cigarettes for sale!

4
00:02:37,719 --> 00:02:38,439
Mr. Mizuno.

5
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:39,639
This way, please. This way.

6
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:47,560
Miss Jiang.

7
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:49,159
I've brought you your medicine.

8
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:50,560
Thank you.

9
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,560
Miss Jiang.

10
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,199
Are you feeling unwell?

11
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:07,800
Weak spleen and stomach.

12
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,719
It's an old problem.

13
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:08,840
It's an old problem.

14
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,159
I'm currently studying traditional Chinese medicine.

15
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:15,199
Miss Jiang, if you don't mind,

16
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,879
please allow me to check your pulse.

17
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:49,560
Miss Jiang

18
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,520
Could you open the medicine packet and let me take a look?

19
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:40,040
Mr. Mizuno

20
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:41,319
These medicines

21
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:42,240
are fine, right?

22
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,240
They do suit the symptoms.

23
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,720
It seems Miss Jiang didn't consult a quack after all.

24
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,920
Since that's the case,

25
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,959
I won't disturb you any further.

26
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,079
I'll have someone deliver

27
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:56,319
some premium Japanese medicines another day.

28
00:04:56,519 --> 00:04:57,959
Please accept them, Miss Jiang.

29
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,000
Thank you very much, Mr. Mizuno.

30
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,279
I have to remind you

31
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:30,279
You don't have much time left

32
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,079
You need to seize this last chance

33
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:36,839
Speak

34
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:40,079
Where is Yan Jiu's supply hidden?

35
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,120
I don't know

36
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:42,920
I really don't know

37
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,240
Please, just make it quick for me

38
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,759
Underwater

39
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,399
Your breathing will get harder and harder

40
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:54,839
This suffocating feeling

41
00:06:57,399 --> 00:07:00,279
You probably don't want to experience it a second time, do you?

42
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:18,160
Chief Cui

43
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,120
Everyone

44
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:22,279
Within five minutes

45
00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:23,000
Assemble and move out

46
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,800
Yes

47
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:29,120
Director

48
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,480
Notify Chen Gengsheng

49
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:31,879
Director

50
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:33,879
You don't trust Cui Mo

51
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,199
At this critical moment

52
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:37,560
We can't afford any mistakes

53
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,279
Even working like a dog for the Japanese

54
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:41,079
They're still not reassured

55
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,680
Now they've sent

56
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:45,040
this woman, Hirata, to watch me

57
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,319
We can't give them any leverage

58
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,040
It's better to play it safe

59
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,279
Yes

60
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,079
Team Leader

61
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,199
The Director has an assignment

62
00:07:57,879 --> 00:07:58,639
Continue

63
00:07:58,639 --> 00:07:59,199
Yes

64
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:01,079
Until we dig up the goods

65
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:14,199
Line up

66
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:15,959
Search for suspicious individuals

67
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:16,759
Yes

68
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:17,300
Move aside

69
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,860
We must find it before the Japanese do

70
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:19,860
the Yulongshan killer

71
00:08:20,379 --> 00:08:21,479
Move aside, move aside

72
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:22,839
Everyone move, hurry up

73
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:33,540
Have there been any new faces in the shop lately?

74
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:38,039
Search

75
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,120
Miss

76
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:45,840
We're here

77
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:47,799
Thank you very much

78
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:49,200
Thank you

79
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:14,080
You're late

80
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,320
It's easy for you to talk when you're not the one suffering

81
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:17,679
I managed to make it back, didn't I?

82
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,480
After leaving the station

83
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,600
there were checkpoints set up by Japanese military police everywhere

84
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,080
Where's the stuff?

85
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,000
Little Pepper

86
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,679
I'm still your superior, Jin Chengwen

87
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,799
Fat Jin

88
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:36,840
If you want to act all high and mighty

89
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,799
go find someone else

90
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:42,559
What you're holding in your hand

91
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,759
from the Suzhou side

92
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:45,080
is the newly activated codebook.

93
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,480
You did a pretty good job on the mission.

94
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,080
Later, I'll report to the station chief

95
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,080
and recommend you for commendation.

96
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,039
That's not necessary.

97
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,120
And don't come to me for this kind of thing again.

98
00:09:54,519 --> 00:09:55,639
I'm just a telegraph translator.

99
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,679
It's already against the rules for me to go out on fieldwork.

100
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,919
You'd better get this straight.

101
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,919
All of this is arranged by the higher-ups.

102
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:02,840
Here,

103
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:04,240
following orders from superiors

104
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,639
is the most basic requirement.

105
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:07,120
Stop going on and on about "superiors" with me.

106
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,080
And "the higher-ups."

107
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,240
Do you really think I don't know

108
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,679
about your scare tactics?

109
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:11,480
What do you mean by that?

110
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:12,320
Nothing in particular.

111
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:13,799
Can I go back to decoding now?

112
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:14,519
No.

113
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:15,840
Let me tell you, Little Pepper,

114
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,039
extraordinary times call for extraordinary actions.

115
00:10:18,039 --> 00:10:20,000
If you dare defy me like that again,

116
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:23,679
What are you doing?

117
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:24,840
Put it away.

118
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:27,919
No.

119
00:10:28,679 --> 00:10:29,480
Nian Ci.

120
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:32,559
It's not that I insist on using you office staff.

121
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,279
Those are the station chief's exact words.

122
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,399
The Japanese are investigating closely now.

123
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:36,879
Using new faces like yours

124
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:38,080
makes things easier.

125
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:39,919
Um...

126
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:40,480
Get ready.

127
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,000
In a bit, you still have to

128
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,480
come with me to the Lin Family Hotel.

129
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:43,480
For what?

130
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,279
To attend a private banquet.

131
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,639
A female server there

132
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:48,080
has already been bribed by us.

133
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:49,080
You

134
00:10:50,679 --> 00:10:52,519
will cover her shift.

135
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:53,399
Oh, right.

136
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:56,879
This—

137
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,879
Find a way to bring this inside for me.

138
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,799
What is it?

139
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:02,440
This isn't cigarettes, is it?

140
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:03,519
Of course not.

141
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:04,480
What is it?

142
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,240
You'll know when the time comes.

143
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:33,440
I can't believe we actually found it.

144
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,080
Yan Jiu's hideout.

145
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,759
It seems this assassin has a very clear target.

146
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,679
I'm becoming more and more convinced

147
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:41,039
that my judgment was correct.

148
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:43,960
But what good does finding it do?

149
00:11:45,559 --> 00:11:47,279
The military police just searched this place.

150
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,200
We've also searched it many times.

151
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:51,080
Any place where something could be hidden

152
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,519
is already gone.

153
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,360
There's nothing valuable left here.

154
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:00,320
This lamp...

155
00:12:00,919 --> 00:12:02,279
Last time we were here,

156
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:04,879
it could still be lit.

157
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,720
It seems

158
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,799
Director Cui is extremely thorough in his work.

159
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:12,840
So what you're implying, Group Leader Chen,

160
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,679
is that I made a mistake?

161
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:17,919
Director Cui,

162
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:21,440
I want to re-investigate all of Yan Jiu's files.

163
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:24,080
Hand the files over to Group Leader Chen.

164
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,519
Group Leader Chen,

165
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:26,919
from here on out,

166
00:12:26,919 --> 00:12:28,600
it's up to you to show your skills.

167
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,320
Don't let the director down

168
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,799
with his expectations for you.

169
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:39,600
Let's go.

170
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,519
Yes, sir.

171
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:17,960
Key

172
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,919
Represents preservation

173
00:13:20,919 --> 00:13:21,879
Drive

174
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,919
Japanese involvement

175
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,120
Indicates strategic value

176
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,480
Ruijin Company

177
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,559
Represents medical care

178
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:30,960
Combination of the three

179
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,399
There is only one possibility

180
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,519
Sulfanilamide

181
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,039
Hello, sir

182
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:48,120
Do you need help?

183
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,639
I'm from Renbao Hospital

184
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,799
I'd like to ask about something

185
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:52,960
About six months ago

186
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:53,600
From your company

187
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,720
Order information for a batch of sulfanilamide that was purchased

188
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:56,799
Please come with me

189
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:03,559
Identification

190
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,679
The mission is simple.

191
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:08,000
Wait until the guards change shifts.

192
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,039
Take that

193
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:11,480
and give it to Lao Chu, the chef in the meal prep room.

194
00:14:11,879 --> 00:14:12,840
Operation time

195
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,799
Support personnel

196
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,080
For such a big operation,

197
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,919
you only have two instructions?

198
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:18,720
Your field operations department

199
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,960
is it always this casual in your approach?

200
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,000
Don’t ask what you shouldn’t.

201
00:14:22,039 --> 00:14:24,440
Just do your own job well.

202
00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:26,080
If you don’t explain clearly, I won’t go.

203
00:14:26,679 --> 00:14:27,480
Fat Jin

204
00:14:27,799 --> 00:14:29,320
You look so delicate,

205
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,840
why don’t you dress as a woman?

206
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,000
It’s not impossible.

207
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:34,360
I’m talking about you.

208
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,960
I at least need to know

209
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,440
what I’m doing, right?

210
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,440
This is poison.

211
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,080
Target

212
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,399
Mizuno Shingen

213
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:45,600
After you go in, find Lao Chu.

214
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,279
He’ll tell you the escape route.

215
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,559
What about you?

216
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,320
I’m the superior.

217
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,879
Of course, I’ll be outside giving orders.

218
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:53,840
I see.

219
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,039
Little Pepper

220
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,679
It’s not your place to lecture me.

221
00:14:56,679 --> 00:14:57,080
Let me tell you,

222
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,120
these are all orders from above.

223
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:58,720
Understand?

224
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,159
If you really think you’re so capable,

225
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,159
then prove it by completing the mission beautifully.

226
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,960
Cigarettes for sale!

227
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,279
Take a look.

228
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:15,120
Cigarettes.

229
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,720
Cigarettes for sale!

230
00:15:18,039 --> 00:15:18,720
In the past six months,

231
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,759
there haven't been any large orders of sulfa drugs.

232
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,399
Maybe even earlier.

233
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,679
I can't quite remember the exact time.

234
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,679
Let me check again for you.

235
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:28,559
Alright.

236
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:29,320
Go inside.

237
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:30,440
Hurry up and go.

238
00:15:30,919 --> 00:15:31,200
You.

239
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:31,679
Come up.

240
00:15:32,919 --> 00:15:33,600
Brother.

241
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,039
You smoke pretty well.

242
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:41,320
Brother.

243
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,000
This is a new one.

244
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,840
Try this one.

245
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,360
You're pretty savvy.

246
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:44,919
Alright.

247
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:45,759
Go inside.

248
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,039
You two, come here.

249
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,240
Thank you, brother.

250
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:51,480
There was a large order.

251
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,320
But it was in February.

252
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,360
But it wasn't from your Renbao Hospital.

253
00:15:55,919 --> 00:15:56,720
Who was it?

254
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:57,679
Sorry.

255
00:15:57,679 --> 00:15:59,399
We can't disclose that.

256
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,120
It was Master Jiu.

257
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,480
Sir, you can't look at this casually.

258
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,279
Sir, this can't be viewed casually.

259
00:16:09,879 --> 00:16:10,720
What are you doing?

260
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:11,639
Give it to me.

261
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:13,320
What's wrong?

262
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,480
This can't be looked at casually.

263
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:35,240
Stop right there.

264
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:37,720
You.

265
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,240
Call for help.

266
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,240
I said, stop!

267
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:53,399
Guard the door.

268
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:54,120
Yes.

269
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,960
So you were hiding here to slack off.

270
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:28,559
Don't you know the banquet is about to start?

271
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,079
Go.

272
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:30,720
Go back to work.

273
00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:31,480
Sorry, sorry.

274
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:31,960
Go.

275
00:17:32,039 --> 00:17:32,839
Get to work.

276
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,599
Sorry.

277
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:36,880
This guy is slacking off.

278
00:17:37,079 --> 00:17:38,279
I'll get back to work right away.

279
00:17:38,759 --> 00:17:39,599
Please go back.

280
00:17:40,039 --> 00:17:41,240
Please go back, please go back.

281
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:47,400
Sir.

282
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,680
Someone here is trying to steal the ledger.

283
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,160
Guard the door.

284
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:50,680
Where?

285
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,400
Over here.

286
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:51,839
Let's go.

287
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:52,599
Go take a look.

288
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,799
He's been trying to snatch it the whole time.

289
00:17:55,519 --> 00:17:56,599
This way, this way.

290
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:09,160
You must be Old Chu.

291
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:09,839
Yes.

292
00:18:10,039 --> 00:18:11,079
Thank you for earlier.

293
00:18:11,079 --> 00:18:12,319
Good thing you know some Japanese.

294
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,359
The whole Lin family are traitors.

295
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,519
Knowing some Japanese

296
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:16,559
is nothing special.

297
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:17,559
Where is the item?

298
00:18:18,359 --> 00:18:19,160
Here.

299
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,200
Great.

300
00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:25,400
With this,

301
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,920
that bastard Mizuno

302
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:27,920
is as good as dead.

303
00:18:28,359 --> 00:18:29,240
This

304
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,319
is poison.

305
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,920
During the banquet,

306
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,359
no one is allowed to leave.

307
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:35,319
Go hide in the back kitchen's storage room for now.

308
00:18:35,559 --> 00:18:36,519
Once Mizuno is dead,

309
00:18:36,519 --> 00:18:37,720
there will definitely be chaos.

310
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:38,960
Take the chance to slip away.

311
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:40,160
If the plan fails,

312
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:41,319
set a fire as a signal.

313
00:18:41,319 --> 00:18:43,160
Our people will meet you at the back door.

314
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:43,880
What about you?

315
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,480
As long as he's dead,

316
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:46,640
I'll have my own way out.

317
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:47,839
Alright.

318
00:18:48,119 --> 00:18:48,759
Be careful.

319
00:18:48,759 --> 00:18:49,440
Go quickly.

320
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,160
Is everything ready?

321
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,039
Don't worry, Chief.

322
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:30,079
The escape route.

323
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:33,279
Wait at the café outside the back door of the Lin Family Hotel.

324
00:19:33,279 --> 00:19:34,440
After Lao Chu poisons them,

325
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,279
he'll escape by jumping out the second-floor window.

326
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,480
That’s right at the hotel’s back door.

327
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:40,839
Then our people will fire at the hotel.

328
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,039
This will lure the Japanese into the alley outside the back door.

329
00:19:43,279 --> 00:19:44,039
Make sure Lao Chu

330
00:19:44,039 --> 00:19:45,119
gets out safely.

331
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:47,279
Everyone must be fully prepared.

332
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,119
Once Lao Chu succeeds,

333
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,119
be ready to support and follow up.

334
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,440
We must restore the reputation of our Shanghai station.

335
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,680
We need to regain our standing.

336
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,240
This is our last chance.

337
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:57,880
Understood.

338
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:28,359
Help!

339
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,359
Help!

340
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,880
Help!

341
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:33,759
Help!

342
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:38,720
Something’s happening.

343
00:20:38,839 --> 00:20:39,839
Hurry upstairs and check.

344
00:20:42,119 --> 00:20:43,200
Help!

345
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,200
It is my great honor this time

346
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,480
to have invited Mr. Mizuno

347
00:20:57,759 --> 00:20:58,960
to attend a banquet at the Lin family hotel.

348
00:20:59,079 --> 00:21:00,640
It truly is my personal honor.

349
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,160
This is Mr. Lin,

350
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,759
who has recently taken a position at the Economic Department

351
00:21:04,759 --> 00:21:06,119
as a new local official.

352
00:21:06,359 --> 00:21:07,039
For many years,

353
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:10,279
he has maintained close relations with the consulate.

354
00:21:10,359 --> 00:21:11,119
We

355
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,680
are also old acquaintances.

356
00:21:14,359 --> 00:21:16,359
Mr. Lin's hotel is truly magnificent.

357
00:21:16,359 --> 00:21:18,319
I am genuinely envious.

358
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,519
Not at all.

359
00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:21,720
My humble place only shines because of your esteemed presence.

360
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:23,240
It is your visit that brings it to life.

361
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,119
This is my wife,

362
00:21:26,039 --> 00:21:26,839
and my son.

363
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,440
Greet our guests.

364
00:21:29,799 --> 00:21:30,880
Hello.

365
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,759
Young Master Lin is truly adorable.

366
00:21:33,799 --> 00:21:34,960
Like father, like son.

367
00:21:35,319 --> 00:21:37,160
The Lin family has a worthy successor.

368
00:21:39,559 --> 00:21:40,559
Please.

369
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,000
This way, please.

370
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,400
We have prepared a simple family meal.

371
00:22:12,839 --> 00:22:14,400
I hope Mr. Mizuno will enjoy it.

372
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:16,279
Xiao Wang,

373
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,839
please take the child outside.

374
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,319
Since this is a family dinner,

375
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,720
let's all stay together.

376
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,599
Let Young Master Lin sit next to me.

377
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:24,559
Alright.

378
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,680
Then you may go.

379
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,640
Mr. Mizuno is so distinguished,

380
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,079
yet still so courteous.

381
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,160
Director Hirata,

382
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,079
please.

383
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:36,160
Everyone, please be seated.

384
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,519
Please sit.

385
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:43,920
Mr. Lin

386
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:45,359
Everyone is here.

387
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,519
Serve the dishes.

388
00:22:46,519 --> 00:22:47,119
Alright.

389
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:48,599
Here.

390
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,359
Mr. Mizuno

391
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,400
Today's ingredients

392
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,799
were all personally selected by me.

393
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:12,079
I hope they can be as pure as my respect for you,

394
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,559
pure and profound.

395
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,240
Look at this boiling soup base.

396
00:23:15,319 --> 00:23:17,119
It symbolizes my loyal heart to you.

397
00:23:17,319 --> 00:23:18,839
No matter how turbulent the outside world is,

398
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:21,240
my faith and passion are just like this soup,

399
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:22,680
enduring and fervent.

400
00:23:22,839 --> 00:23:25,279
Combined with the skills of our head chef, Old Chu, today,

401
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:27,559
it's truly a feast for both the palate and the soul.

402
00:23:27,559 --> 00:23:28,400
Please have a taste.

403
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,119
That's right.

404
00:23:29,119 --> 00:23:31,279
This is Old Chu's very best dish.

405
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,880
Everyone, hurry and try it.

406
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:34,440
It smells so good.

407
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,039
When is it my turn?

408
00:23:36,119 --> 00:23:38,200
Since Young Master Lin likes it,

409
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,920
then this piece from uncle

410
00:23:40,359 --> 00:23:41,359
is for you.

411
00:23:41,359 --> 00:23:41,880
No, please.

412
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:42,359
Alright.

413
00:23:42,359 --> 00:23:43,640
This... this won't do.

414
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,559
It really won't do.

415
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,279
Young master,

416
00:23:46,319 --> 00:23:47,319
this meat

417
00:23:47,319 --> 00:23:48,799
needs to be cooked before you can eat it.

418
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:51,000
Eating it raw will upset your stomach.

419
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:52,519
You are an honored guest.

420
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:53,839
This kind of rough work

421
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,319
should be done by us servants.

422
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:55,960
Here.

423
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:56,759
Young master,

424
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:58,960
let me cook it for you.

425
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,960
It needs to be cooked thoroughly.

426
00:24:02,319 --> 00:24:03,440
You have to let this soup

427
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:03,759
You have to let this soup

428
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,640
completely soak into the meat.

429
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:07,359
That way,

430
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:08,119
that way,

431
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:10,640
it will be at its best.

432
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:11,680
Here you go.

433
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:13,119
Young master,

434
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,279
please enjoy.

435
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:15,720
Please enjoy.

436
00:24:16,119 --> 00:24:16,759
Please enjoy.

437
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,440
Let's go.

438
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,799
Everyone, hurry and try it too.

439
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:21,279
Everyone, hurry and try it too.

440
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,279
Wait.

441
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:48,319
It can't be just him, he must have accomplices.

442
00:24:48,359 --> 00:24:50,599
Seal off the entire mansion immediately.

443
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,359
Mr. Lin,

444
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:56,559
is this how you treat your guests?

445
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:29,599
Sir

446
00:25:29,599 --> 00:25:30,400
There's a fire

447
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,359
Take me to see it, quickly

448
00:25:31,359 --> 00:25:31,839
Okay

449
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:37,160
The operation has failed

450
00:25:37,839 --> 00:25:39,400
Go support our people immediately

451
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,880
Withdraw all operatives

452
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,119
Abandon the contact point

453
00:25:43,759 --> 00:25:44,559
Understood

454
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:53,480
Captain

455
00:25:53,599 --> 00:25:54,240
Notify the others

456
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,119
Retreat quickly

457
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:55,960
Wait, Captain

458
00:25:56,079 --> 00:25:57,319
Our men haven't come out yet

459
00:25:57,319 --> 00:25:58,480
Are you stupid?

460
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,920
You go, go on

461
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,279
Who could get out in this situation?

462
00:26:03,079 --> 00:26:03,880
Retreat

463
00:26:04,519 --> 00:26:05,240
Keep your voice down

464
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,480
Afraid the enemy can't hear you?

465
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:08,559
Retreat

466
00:26:18,119 --> 00:26:19,279
Put out the fire

467
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,759
Go to the back kitchen

468
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,079
Search for the cause of the fire

469
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:30,039
Block off the street

470
00:26:30,039 --> 00:26:30,839
Yes

471
00:26:35,599 --> 00:26:36,480
Hey

472
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:37,440
Stop

473
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:40,000
Search carefully

474
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,079
Move aside

475
00:26:57,799 --> 00:26:59,720
Go away, go away

476
00:27:00,039 --> 00:27:01,759
Go away, go away

477
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:03,400
Go away

478
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:05,559
Go away

479
00:27:05,559 --> 00:27:06,240
Go away, go away

480
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,000
Go away

481
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,200
Go away, go away

482
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,240
Every corner

483
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,680
Search for me

484
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,160
Yes

485
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,000
It's you.

486
00:28:13,799 --> 00:28:14,480
Let go.

487
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,400
Who are you?

488
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,000
Why are you following me?

489
00:28:26,359 --> 00:28:28,000
I said I'm being hunted by the Japanese.

490
00:28:28,119 --> 00:28:29,000
Do you believe me?

491
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,759
Earlier at the train station,

492
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,680
weren't you chatting so warmly with the Japanese?

493
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,039
Wasn't it me who saved you?

494
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,319
Who knows if you have some ulterior motive?

495
00:28:43,839 --> 00:28:44,960
Believe it or not.

496
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:46,480
We'd better not meet again.

497
00:29:05,799 --> 00:29:06,920
Something's happening over there.

498
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,079
Let's go take a look.

499
00:29:09,799 --> 00:29:12,519
They caught a girl in blue over there.

500
00:29:12,759 --> 00:29:14,079
Let's go help.

501
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:18,039
Firecrackers.

502
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:20,359
Firecrackers.

503
00:29:20,359 --> 00:29:21,519
Take a look.

504
00:29:21,519 --> 00:29:22,599
Firecrackers.

505
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,359
Selling firecrackers!

506
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,640
Take her away.

507
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,440
Let's go.

508
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:43,799
Squad one.

509
00:29:44,079 --> 00:29:45,039
Go check it out.

510
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:47,920
Move.

511
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,200
Over there.

512
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,319
Thank you.

513
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:18,680
Here.

514
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:19,920
That guy is here.

515
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:20,720
This way.

516
00:30:37,599 --> 00:30:38,400
This way.

517
00:31:08,079 --> 00:31:08,839
What are you doing?

518
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,519
It's so high.

519
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:23,480
Over there.

520
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,240
They're coming.

521
00:31:25,119 --> 00:31:26,359
Stop!

522
00:31:36,359 --> 00:31:36,880
Chase them!

523
00:31:39,079 --> 00:31:39,599
Go!

524
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,279
Chief

525
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,279
I failed in my duties.

526
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,519
I startled you.

527
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:06,880
Miss Hirata

528
00:32:07,079 --> 00:32:08,079
Thank you for your hard work.

529
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:11,480
We came here today specifically to have Chinese food.

530
00:32:11,839 --> 00:32:12,559
These are dishes that

531
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:14,480
we normally can't enjoy.

532
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,160
This is a trap set by anti-Japanese elements.

533
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,480
Chief, your safety is our top priority.

534
00:32:20,759 --> 00:32:22,599
No need to worry.

535
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,720
Which ones are not safe to eat?

536
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:28,200
These people have already tasted them for me.

537
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,440
I originally wanted to create

538
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,680
a benevolent political environment.

539
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:35,079
I didn't expect it would lead to this outcome.

540
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,039
Alright, alright.

541
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:40,079
It's safe here now.

542
00:32:40,079 --> 00:32:40,920
Let go of me.

543
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:44,640
Do you believe me now?

544
00:32:44,839 --> 00:32:45,880
Consider this a favor I owe you.

545
00:32:46,319 --> 00:32:47,720
I'll repay you in the future.

546
00:32:48,319 --> 00:32:49,200
That's not necessary.

547
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,839
Intelligence indicates

548
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,680
suspicious individuals were spotted at the Ruijin Building.

549
00:33:02,319 --> 00:33:04,440
You encountered danger

550
00:33:04,599 --> 00:33:07,599
at the Lin residence.

551
00:33:07,799 --> 00:33:09,359
These two incidents

552
00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:11,000
seem to be connected.

553
00:33:11,799 --> 00:33:13,200
I will quickly

554
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,319
round them all up.

555
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,039
Rather than fighting alone,

556
00:33:18,039 --> 00:33:19,960
it's better to rely on the strength of many.

557
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,480
It's more efficient.

558
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,640
Working with the Chinese

559
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,000
is the same.

560
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,039
Understood.

561
00:33:37,759 --> 00:33:38,480
Director

562
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,279
Section Chief Chen

563
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,240
Director

564
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,039
He's here.

565
00:33:44,759 --> 00:33:45,759
Go take a look at that.

566
00:33:48,119 --> 00:33:49,759
According to the report from the military police,

567
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,759
the assassin from Yulong Mountain

568
00:33:51,759 --> 00:33:54,039
has already entered the Ruijin Building.

569
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:55,519
Gengsheng,

570
00:33:56,079 --> 00:33:57,119
what do you think?

571
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:00,000
These past few days,

572
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,519
I have re-examined the information.

573
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,319
Based on my analysis,

574
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,279
no matter who this assassin is,

575
00:34:06,279 --> 00:34:07,960
there is only one possible goal.

576
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:10,760
To obtain the explosives left by Yan Jiu.

577
00:34:11,039 --> 00:34:13,639
Otherwise, he could have easily escaped to North China or Jiangsu.

578
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:15,440
Why risk coming back to Shanghai?

579
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:18,000
Go on.

580
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:19,679
I believe

581
00:34:19,719 --> 00:34:21,360
since Yulong Mountain is our responsibility,

582
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,480
then this operation

583
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,280
is something we absolutely shouldn't stay out of.

584
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,239
The assassin

585
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:26,599
and the explosives

586
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:27,960
must both be found by us.

587
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:28,079
We must find them.

588
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,119
Therefore, I suggest

589
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:31,960
that we take the initiative to cooperate with the military police

590
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,559
and assist in investigating this matter.

591
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,239
This way,

592
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:36,239
we can seize the initiative

593
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:38,000
and keep track of all developments.

594
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:41,079
Of course,

595
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,159
all of this

596
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:44,039
will depend on your arrangements, Director.

597
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,440
Secretary Wang

598
00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:52,440
Director

599
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:53,800
Convey my orders

600
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,199
to Miss Hirata

601
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,280
and suggest

602
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,079
that Team Leader Chen

603
00:34:59,079 --> 00:35:00,800
assist in investigating this matter

604
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,239
Yes

605
00:35:05,639 --> 00:35:06,679
Gengsheng

606
00:35:06,679 --> 00:35:07,480
Do your best

607
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:08,840
Go

608
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:10,280
Yes

609
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,159
Regarding the Yulongshan incident

610
00:35:19,239 --> 00:35:20,360
we lost

611
00:35:20,679 --> 00:35:22,480
but not to the assassins

612
00:35:22,639 --> 00:35:23,679
We lost because

613
00:35:23,679 --> 00:35:25,079
all our intelligence

614
00:35:25,079 --> 00:35:27,079
was a step behind Meihuatang

615
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,679
which gave them the advantage

616
00:35:28,679 --> 00:35:30,440
and led to our current predicament

617
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,320
So

618
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:34,960
from now on

619
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,000
you

620
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,679
keep a close watch on everything for me

621
00:35:40,679 --> 00:35:41,679
Understood

622
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:53,800
Gardenia, magnolia.

623
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,239
Sir.

624
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,000
Please take a look.

625
00:36:02,239 --> 00:36:03,920
Tailong Chamber of Commerce.

626
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,519
What exactly does this mean?

627
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,599
It suggests that it's very likely there

628
00:36:10,119 --> 00:36:12,199
will be the assassin's next target.

629
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,480
I've seen you before.

630
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,000
You're from the Special Agent Headquarters.

631
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:18,719
Number 76.

632
00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:20,280
Communications Team Leader Chen Gengsheng.

633
00:36:20,599 --> 00:36:22,000
Reporting to Officer Hirata.

634
00:36:22,159 --> 00:36:23,039
Reporting in.

635
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:26,840
Director Li has already spoken to me.

636
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,480
He said that Number 76

637
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:31,039
will cooperate with us in the investigation.

638
00:36:31,199 --> 00:36:32,400
Then tell me,

639
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,400
why

640
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,320
do you think the assassin's next target

641
00:36:35,519 --> 00:36:36,880
is the Tailong Chamber of Commerce?

642
00:36:37,159 --> 00:36:37,760
Sir,

643
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:40,360
we just found traces of the assassin

644
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,079
in the old house on Yanjiu Hexi Road.

645
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:45,239
Right after that, something happened at the Ruijin Building.

646
00:36:45,719 --> 00:36:46,880
Don't you think

647
00:36:47,199 --> 00:36:49,320
there's a connection between these events?

648
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:54,119
I think

649
00:36:54,719 --> 00:36:56,360
the assassin's choice of location

650
00:36:56,639 --> 00:36:58,199
doesn't seem random.

651
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:01,880
That's true.

652
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,119
He must have been at Yulong Mountain

653
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,800
and obtained a crucial lead on the explosives.

654
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,880
That's why he headed south

655
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,320
and came to Shanghai.

656
00:37:10,639 --> 00:37:12,440
He targeted Yan Jiu's businesses

657
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,800
and took action.

658
00:37:14,639 --> 00:37:15,480
After all,

659
00:37:16,119 --> 00:37:19,280
Yan Jiu is the general manager of Tailong Chamber of Commerce.

660
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:20,719
By the way,

661
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:23,440
your analysis makes sense, sir.

662
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,000
In that case,

663
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,039
let him look for clues.

664
00:37:31,239 --> 00:37:32,840
If we can't find the explosives,

665
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:34,880
but he manages to,

666
00:37:35,159 --> 00:37:36,599
then we'll

667
00:37:36,599 --> 00:37:38,280
catch him in the act.

668
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:39,719
Sir,

669
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,000
that's a good plan.

670
00:37:41,239 --> 00:37:43,519
Start monitoring the Tailong Chamber of Commerce immediately.

671
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:44,480
Understood.

672
00:37:52,039 --> 00:37:53,920
Since this is Director Li's arrangement,

673
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,039
then, Team Leader Chen,

674
00:37:55,559 --> 00:37:57,559
you'll act with us.

675
00:37:58,760 --> 00:37:59,480
I

676
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:00,599
am honored.

677
00:38:11,239 --> 00:38:12,119
Let's do it here.

678
00:38:12,199 --> 00:38:12,880
Alright.

679
00:38:14,679 --> 00:38:15,480
Thank you.

680
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:16,159
Thanks.

681
00:38:25,639 --> 00:38:27,280
What bad luck this round.

682
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,440
You're really not lucky today.

683
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,320
Cheng.

684
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,320
This operation failed.

685
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,320
It's not our fault.

686
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,400
Who would've thought that old Chu

687
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,639
seems reliable on normal days,

688
00:38:33,679 --> 00:38:35,719
but can't handle things when it matters.

689
00:38:35,719 --> 00:38:37,360
You're worrying about nothing.

690
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,599
As long as the chief doesn't say anything about this,

691
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:40,239
and doesn't blame us,

692
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,119
we brothers should just eat

693
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:43,239
and have fun as usual.

694
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:46,960
Place your bets, place your bets.

695
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:47,880
Brother Cheng.

696
00:38:48,039 --> 00:38:49,239
A new shipment arrived recently.

697
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:51,280
It's already stored in the dock warehouse.

698
00:38:51,639 --> 00:38:52,599
Here's the amount.

699
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:53,559
This much?

700
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:54,760
Is it weapons

701
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:55,639
or radios?

702
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,039
Is it from the Nanjing government?

703
00:38:57,559 --> 00:38:58,559
Why do you care so much?

704
00:38:58,559 --> 00:38:59,559
Just make money, that's all.

705
00:38:59,559 --> 00:39:00,440
Right, Brother Cheng?

706
00:39:00,679 --> 00:39:01,519
Old Liu.

707
00:39:01,719 --> 00:39:03,480
You're really something.

708
00:39:03,559 --> 00:39:04,960
Just trying to get by with Brother Cheng.

709
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:07,079
How much was Old Chu's compensation?

710
00:39:07,559 --> 00:39:08,320
The claim went through.

711
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,559
They only gave sixty yuan.

712
00:39:09,559 --> 00:39:10,320
Sixty?

713
00:39:10,559 --> 00:39:12,440
That's not even enough for the guys to have a night out.

714
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:12,840
Enough.

715
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:13,440
It's not a small amount.

716
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,559
You two split it.

717
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:15,079
Really?

718
00:39:15,079 --> 00:39:15,480
Really.

719
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:15,920
Thank you, Brother Cheng.

720
00:39:16,039 --> 00:39:16,800
Fat Jin.

721
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:17,880
Are you even human?

722
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:19,840
Old Chu died for the country.

723
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,639
You won't even let go of his compensation.

724
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:22,599
Little Pepper, you—

725
00:39:22,599 --> 00:39:23,280
Didn't you already—

726
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,800
Wasn't I already dead?

727
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:25,880
I'm really sorry.

728
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,199
I must have disappointed you.

729
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:28,599
I'm still alive.

730
00:39:29,639 --> 00:39:30,719
It's good to be alive, it's good to be alive.

731
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:31,800
Fat Jin.

732
00:39:32,239 --> 00:39:33,199
I really didn't expect this.

733
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:35,199
We're both fighting to save the country from the Japanese.

734
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,159
How can you be so heartless?

735
00:39:37,199 --> 00:39:38,719
How am I being heartless?

736
00:39:39,079 --> 00:39:40,079
Old Chu has no children.

737
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:40,840
Where is his mother now?

738
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:41,519
No one knows.

739
00:39:41,519 --> 00:39:42,320
The brothers worked so hard.

740
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:42,679
Share some money.

741
00:39:42,679 --> 00:39:43,599
Isn't that what should be done?

742
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:43,960
That's right.

743
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:44,400
Shut up.

744
00:39:45,519 --> 00:39:46,440
Then tell me.

745
00:39:47,159 --> 00:39:48,519
The team that was supposed to provide backup—

746
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:49,760
Why did they withdraw early?

747
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,559
And also—

748
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:53,400
There was supposed to be someone with a gun covering the back door of the hotel.

749
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:54,559
Where are they?

750
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:55,719
Where are the guns?

751
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:56,679
No, that's not it.

752
00:39:56,679 --> 00:39:58,800
Didn't we think you all died heroically for the country?

753
00:39:59,639 --> 00:40:00,400
Right?

754
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,000
You—if you say that again—

755
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:01,920
You don't know what happened later.

756
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,800
To minimize casualties,

757
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,840
we had no choice but to order a retreat.

758
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:06,280
That's right.

759
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,639
We had no other choice.

760
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:09,719
Don't give me those high-sounding excuses.

761
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,239
Fat Jin, remember this.

762
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:12,320
This matter,

763
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:13,639
plus the issue of the compensation money,

764
00:40:13,719 --> 00:40:15,280
I will definitely report it to the station chief.

765
00:40:15,639 --> 00:40:16,719
I'm not done with you.

766
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:17,400
You—

767
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:19,760
You immature little brat.

768
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,320
Just an ordinary operative,

769
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:23,159
who gave her the right to question her superiors?

770
00:40:26,119 --> 00:40:26,920
Brother Cheng

771
00:40:27,559 --> 00:40:28,320
Little Pepper

772
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:28,960
What's wrong?

773
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,000
You're being outrageous.

774
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:30,760
You want to report me, is that it?

775
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:31,559
Go on, go ahead.

776
00:40:31,639 --> 00:40:33,199
Do you think the station chief trusts you or me?

777
00:40:33,199 --> 00:40:34,239
You're shameless.

778
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,360
I'm shameless?

779
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:36,880
You're way out of line.

780
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,559
If you don't report me, I'll report you.

781
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,079
Who spoiled her like this?

782
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:40,920
No, no, no, come here.

783
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:42,239
I'm her superior.

784
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:43,519
What does she want to do?

785
00:40:43,719 --> 00:40:44,960
She's completely out of control.

786
00:40:54,199 --> 00:40:55,159
Selling cigarettes.

787
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,400
Selling cigarettes.

788
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:02,239
.

789
00:41:09,079 --> 00:41:09,800
Sir

790
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:10,880
Everything is ready.

791
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:13,280
Waiting.

792
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,840
Waiting is also a test.

793
00:41:21,519 --> 00:41:23,440
Selling hats.

794
00:41:28,679 --> 00:41:30,000
Can you confirm if it's him?

795
00:41:34,679 --> 00:41:35,719
Come, try on a hat.

796
00:41:36,039 --> 00:41:36,920
Keep the change.

797
00:41:37,559 --> 00:41:38,519
Thank you, sir.

798
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:45,719
The figure looks a bit like him.

799
00:41:45,719 --> 00:41:46,480
But

800
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:47,519
I can't see his face clearly.

801
00:41:47,519 --> 00:41:49,159
I need to get a little closer.

802
00:41:49,239 --> 00:41:50,119
You two go.

803
00:41:50,119 --> 00:41:52,159
Don't get spotted.

804
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:52,880
Yes.
