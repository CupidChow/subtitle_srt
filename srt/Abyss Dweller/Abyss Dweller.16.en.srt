1
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,280
Miss Xie

2
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:48,560
It seems very soon

3
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,599
I'll have to start calling you my sister-in-law

4
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:55,519
You two go ahead and talk

5
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:56,760
I'll go get some hot water

6
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,120
Director Hirata

7
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:21,199
Miss Xie is so gentle and charming

8
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,800
She and Mr. Liang are a perfect match

9
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,039
I was a bit reckless just now

10
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:28,319
I hope Mr. Liang won't mind

11
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,240
Not at all

12
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,199
It's all for the new government and the Empire

13
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:35,960
Director Hirata

14
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:37,319
You act with fairness and authority

15
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:38,800
And never show favoritism

16
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,520
Truly admirable

17
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,400
I'm relieved that Mr. Liang is all right

18
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:46,120
But I still want to remind you

19
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:47,960
Be extra careful these days

20
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,960
Rest well in the hospital

21
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,360
Thank you for your concern, Director Hirata

22
00:02:53,719 --> 00:02:55,360
The peace conference is about to begin

23
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,120
I was assigned this task at the last minute

24
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,159
There are many urgent matters to resolve

25
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:00,639
Lying here

26
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,800
I'm afraid I can't really relax

27
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:05,159
Work is important

28
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,319
But your health matters even more

29
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,080
Director Cui

30
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,439
Let's let him rest

31
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,280
Brother Liang

32
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:14,639
We'll be going now

33
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,319
Take good care of your injuries

34
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:17,719
I'll come visit you in a few days

35
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,639
The statements of the two are basically the same.

36
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,199
But no matter how you look at it, Chief Hirata,

37
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,800
it seems you still have doubts.

38
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:01,560
What do you think?

39
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,039
The injuries on his body—

40
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,439
if it were an ordinary person,

41
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:07,599
they would have died several times over.

42
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:10,599
The anti-Japanese elements really wanted him dead.

43
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,680
So there’s definitely no problem with Liang Shuo.

44
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:15,000
As for Miss Xie,

45
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:17,279
that’s still up for discussion.

46
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:19,240
Chief Hirata,

47
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,560
I still have matters to attend to at my office.

48
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,600
I’ll take my leave for now.

49
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,600
Miss Hirata

50
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:30,199
Director Lu

51
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,920
What brings you here?

52
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:34,879
Director Liang was just appointed and already faced an assassination attempt.

53
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:37,079
It certainly caused a sensation throughout the city.

54
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:38,199
With something this significant,

55
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:39,600
as the Director of Supervision,

56
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,279
I naturally can't stay uninvolved.

57
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:42,800
Of course.

58
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:44,279
Given your

59
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,920
ability to gather intelligence,

60
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,519
I assume

61
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,000
you already have some understanding

62
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:49,160
of what happened.

63
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:52,079
The girl by Liang Shuo's side

64
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:54,240
showed up a little too coincidentally.

65
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:55,959
What do you think, Director Lu?

66
00:04:56,199 --> 00:04:57,959
I'm not entirely clear on this matter yet.

67
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,439
But I trust you have your own judgment, Miss Hirata.

68
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,839
Are you alright?

69
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:07,439
I'm fine.

70
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,480
Hirata asked me a few questions.

71
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:11,000
I used an alias.

72
00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:13,079
I don't think I gave anything away.

73
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:15,839
Luckily, we exchanged information in advance.

74
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,040
She won't drop her suspicions so quickly.

75
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,360
We still need to make plans early.

76
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:24,879
She asked for my address.

77
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:27,000
She'll definitely send someone to search.

78
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:29,439
Is there anything suspicious at home?

79
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,680
Don't worry.

80
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,720
I won't bring those things home.

81
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:33,800
Besides,

82
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,600
I'm using a public identity.

83
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:39,240
Chief

84
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,279
This is Liang Shuo's attending physician.

85
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:44,360
Dr. Xu

86
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:46,800
Thank you for your hard work, Dr. Xu.

87
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:49,079
This is Director Lu from the Special Agent Headquarters' Inspection Department.

88
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:50,839
Mr. Liang

89
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,920
How is his current condition?

90
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:54,000
He's fine for now.

91
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:55,759
Please don't worry, Chief.

92
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,040
I was just about to do my rounds.

93
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:58,759
Understood.

94
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,399
Just in case.

95
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:04,319
You still need to go back.

96
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:06,199
What about you?

97
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:07,879
I'm going back to No. 76.

98
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,079
I'll find a way to keep an eye on Hirata Xizi.

99
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,399
Hopefully, she'll be cleared of suspicion soon.

100
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,000
What about your injury?

101
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:18,079
It's not fatal.

102
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,839
The bleeding has stopped.

103
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:20,959
Don't worry.

104
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,519
I can't help but worry.

105
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:24,319
You can't just tough it out like this.

106
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:29,439
You wouldn't listen to me anyway.

107
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,920
Director Liang is fine now.

108
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:34,360
I'd like you to help me investigate this young woman.

109
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,680
Xie Yuxin

110
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:38,399
Her address is 16 Chunhua Road.

111
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:41,959
Lead a team there yourself.

112
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,120
Don't miss a single clue.

113
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,319
Alright.

114
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:50,040
I'm also curious to find out.

115
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,680
Just who is this Miss Xie, really?

116
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,079
Then I'll leave it to Miss Hirata.

117
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:56,680
Please send my regards to Director Liang.

118
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,279
Wish him a speedy recovery.

119
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,279
No problem.

120
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,160
Where did this ring come from?

121
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,519
Ever since Cui Mo first saw you,

122
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:23,959
I was already prepared.

123
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,199
Always leave yourself a way out.

124
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,759
Especially in our line of work.

125
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:36,319
What's wrong?

126
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,319
Nothing.

127
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,000
Mr. Liang,

128
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:41,800
since you're so generous

129
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:44,920
and willingly gave me this ring,

130
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:46,360
now that it's in my pocket,

131
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,319
don't think about getting it back.

132
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,199
Are you like a Pixiu or something?

133
00:07:59,079 --> 00:07:59,839
Come in.

134
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,000
So, what should we do next...

135
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:18,240
Don't put it there.

136
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:26,519
Put it on the cart.

137
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:29,759
You're Chinese?

138
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,559
I'm your attending physician.

139
00:08:33,879 --> 00:08:34,679
Xu Wen.

140
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,440
A Chinese.

141
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,399
Working at a Japanese Army hospital.

142
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:40,559
That's quite rare.

143
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,879
I studied abroad in Japan,

144
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:45,399
at Sendai Medical College as a Chinese student.

145
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:46,960
Just like you, Mr. Liang,

146
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,320
I admire Chairman Wang's peace movement.

147
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:51,159
After graduation, I came to work here.

148
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,960
Director Hirata instructed me

149
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55,159
to pay close attention to your health.

150
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,399
Thank you for your concern.

151
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,759
Actually, my injury isn't serious.

152
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,759
It's my job.

153
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:14,399
Mr. Liang,

154
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:15,639
now I need to check your wound.

155
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:16,759
Let me examine it.

156
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:21,240
Alright.

157
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,200
Look straight ahead.

158
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,120
Mr. Liang's condition is not serious.

159
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,000
At the moment,

160
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,799
it's just caused by the impact.

161
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:48,039
He experienced temporary shock.

162
00:09:48,039 --> 00:09:49,200
He'll be fine after resting for a couple of days.

163
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,879
The bandage on his head needs to be changed regularly.

164
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,120
A nurse will come to check on him at regular intervals.

165
00:09:55,879 --> 00:09:56,960
That's not necessary.

166
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,399
I'll go handle the discharge procedures right away.

167
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,279
If Mr. Liang wants to leave,

168
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:03,519
I have no right to stop him.

169
00:10:03,879 --> 00:10:05,720
But for the sake of your health,

170
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,639
I still hope you'll come back for a follow-up.

171
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,200
If it's really inconvenient,

172
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,480
we can also visit you at home.

173
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,000
Sorry to trouble you, then.

174
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,240
Traitor.

175
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,559
So shameless.

176
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:40,600
Wang Jingwei's remarks

177
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,720
have indeed influenced many Chinese students in Japan.

178
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,360
When he came in just now, he didn't say a word.

179
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:47,480
You exposed him,

180
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,200
and only then did he admit he was Chinese.

181
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,840
He's very cunning.

182
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:55,759
We'll just have to be more vigilant ourselves.

183
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:21,960
Director.

184
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:22,759
I've checked everything.

185
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,080
It's all clean.

186
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,480
I don't see any problems.

187
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:41,440
Stand up.

188
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,000
Again.

189
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:47,159
Again.

190
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:51,600
Again.

191
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:52,799
Stand up.

192
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,159
Again.

193
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,039
Senior, how are you?

194
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:19,919
I'm fine.

195
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,440
But I see you're hurt.

196
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:30,240
Does it still hurt?

197
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,080
It's fine.

198
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:33,159
It doesn't hurt.

199
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,279
It's okay.

200
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,200
It's already been investigated.

201
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,039
This Miss Xie previously

202
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:53,000
did indeed study at Nanyang Girls' School.

203
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:55,080
She is also currently working at a clothing store.

204
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,759
Her background checks out.

205
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,240
Did you check the jewelry store?

206
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,159
I've already asked the owner about that.

207
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,279
Director Liang went there on the 23rd of last month

208
00:13:04,279 --> 00:13:05,799
to order a ring.

209
00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:07,399
The style he wanted

210
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:09,039
wasn't in stock at the store.

211
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:11,240
Director Liang was very generous.

212
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,320
He paid a large sum of money.

213
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,840
The item was ordered from Hong Kong, China.

214
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:15,840
Understood.

215
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,279
How are things on Lu Xijian's side?

216
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:20,519
Miss Xie's residence has been searched.

217
00:13:20,919 --> 00:13:23,360
Director Lu reported that nothing unusual was found.

218
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:25,159
What about progressive books?

219
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,559
None were found.

220
00:13:28,039 --> 00:13:29,000
For a student,

221
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,759
it's unusually clean.

222
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:33,000
Got it.

223
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:41,919
Teacher

224
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:43,759
We've found their whereabouts.

225
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,159
According to the informant,

226
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:47,200
Liang Shuo and Miss were chased by assassins.

227
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,399
They are now out of danger.

228
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,519
Liang Shuo is slightly injured.

229
00:13:49,639 --> 00:13:51,279
He is recovering at the Japanese Army Hospital.

230
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:53,840
But Miss

231
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,200
has been unreachable.

232
00:13:56,879 --> 00:13:57,879
We can't reach her.

233
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:00,000
Keep waiting.

234
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:04,879
Teacher

235
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:06,039
This is

236
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:08,480
a telegram from Chongqing.

237
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,720
Old Liu has realized the seriousness of the situation.

238
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,600
He confronted Mr. Dai.

239
00:14:14,679 --> 00:14:16,399
He wanted to come to Shanghai to assist us.

240
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:17,720
But he was refused.

241
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:19,559
It's really hard to believe

242
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:22,200
that this old fox

243
00:14:22,679 --> 00:14:23,919
would do such a thing.

244
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:26,639
The situation is so unfavorable.

245
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,519
If we wait for Miss to meet the informant,

246
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:29,679
I'm afraid it will delay things.

247
00:14:30,279 --> 00:14:31,200
I'll make a trip to the hospital.

248
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,120
To gather some information.

249
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:32,799
No.

250
00:14:33,559 --> 00:14:34,360
At this time,

251
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,320
we absolutely can't act rashly.

252
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:38,679
Yes.

253
00:14:49,799 --> 00:14:50,559
Tomorrow, have the informant

254
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:52,440
wait near Miss's safe house.

255
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:53,480
Bring the token.

256
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:54,960
If Miss sees it,

257
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,039
she will naturally come to meet.

258
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,159
Be careful not to expose yourself.

259
00:14:59,320 --> 00:14:59,879
Yes.

260
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,399
We still need to be cautious.

261
00:15:09,559 --> 00:15:10,519
We can't let our guard down.

262
00:15:10,519 --> 00:15:11,519
Keep a close watch.

263
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,919
I'll make you something delicious later.

264
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,120
Buy a pack of cigarettes.

265
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:57,919
Get lost.

266
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:20,039
Hello.

267
00:16:20,039 --> 00:16:20,840
Are you looking to buy a painting?

268
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:22,679
Take a look inside.

269
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:27,200
These are all masterpieces by French masters.

270
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,399
They're called oil paintings.

271
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,279
Take a look.

272
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,279
Look at these colors.

273
00:16:30,879 --> 00:16:31,840
And the brushwork.

274
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,200
And this painting as well.

275
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:37,240
I think this one is the best.

276
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,240
This one is also nice.

277
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:48,879
Madam, you have excellent taste.

278
00:16:49,159 --> 00:16:50,840
This is a newly arrived painting.

279
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:51,720
Have a look.

280
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:53,360
I'll take this one.

281
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,000
Alright.

282
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:13,039
There are spies at 16 Chunhua Road.

283
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,039
There's something suspicious about Xie Yuxin.

284
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,240
I see.

285
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,440
Go pay Miss Xie a visit.

286
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,440
Sister.

287
00:17:54,359 --> 00:17:55,200
The fish has taken the bait.

288
00:17:56,759 --> 00:17:57,599
Move out.

289
00:18:10,359 --> 00:18:11,359
I'll talk.

290
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:12,440
So dirty.

291
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:13,920
I'll talk.

292
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,279
What are you doing here?

293
00:18:18,359 --> 00:18:19,000
Waiting.

294
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:19,799
Waiting for someone.

295
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,039
Meeting with an informant.

296
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,279
Who?

297
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,240
If you promise to spare me,

298
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:30,079
I'll tell you.

299
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:33,079
You're in no position to bargain.

300
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:37,359
Meeting with a female informant.

301
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:39,839
I don't know her.

302
00:18:40,279 --> 00:18:42,000
I only know she lives nearby.

303
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:51,880
Chief

304
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,640
What should we do next?

305
00:18:56,119 --> 00:18:56,920
It seems

306
00:18:57,319 --> 00:18:59,839
this is definitely connected to Miss Xie.

307
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:00,960
Let's wait and see.

308
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:01,920
Understood.

309
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,440
By the way,

310
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:05,519
I'll notify Lu Xijian right away.

311
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:07,680
Tell him I have an urgent matter and need to see him.

312
00:19:08,759 --> 00:19:09,319
Got it.

313
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:16,279
Today

314
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,960
has really been full of surprises.

315
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:52,640
Old Zhou,

316
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,359
you sure get a lot of mail every day.

317
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:55,680
Can't be helped.

318
00:19:56,359 --> 00:19:57,599
Director Liang is back.

319
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,839
Director Liang is back.

320
00:20:01,079 --> 00:20:01,880
Old Zhou,

321
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,440
Has Director Hirata returned?

322
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,000
I haven't seen her all day.

323
00:20:07,559 --> 00:20:08,680
I'm on duty today.

324
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:09,880
I haven't seen her either.

325
00:20:17,359 --> 00:20:17,759
Here.

326
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:18,119
Old Hu,

327
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:18,920
It's signed.

328
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,480
Alright.

329
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,039
Zhao Di, prepare the car.

330
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,759
Miss Xie,

331
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:51,759
it seems

332
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,440
I underestimated you.

333
00:20:58,799 --> 00:20:59,880
Director Hirata

334
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,480
You startled me.

335
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,559
What are you doing?

336
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,279
This...

337
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:05,880
Who is this?

338
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,400
You don't know him?

339
00:21:12,119 --> 00:21:13,880
Then do you recognize this?

340
00:21:14,319 --> 00:21:15,240
A matchbox.

341
00:21:16,119 --> 00:21:17,200
I don't smoke.

342
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:20,440
Miss Xie

343
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,519
You won't cry until you see the coffin, huh?

344
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:24,200
Take her.

345
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:25,640
What are you doing?

346
00:21:25,799 --> 00:21:26,559
What are you doing?

347
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:27,839
Let go of me!

348
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,920
Evidence pointing to her

349
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:33,000
There is no direct evidence.

350
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,079
We can only bluff her.

351
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,519
What do you think?

352
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,240
Do you think she's telling the truth?

353
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,319
I don't know.

354
00:21:43,519 --> 00:21:44,319
Today,

355
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:47,640
everything that's happened has been too unusual.

356
00:21:48,079 --> 00:21:50,359
I don't dare trust anyone right now.

357
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,400
How about

358
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:55,559
testing her one more time?

359
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,119
Do we really have to use force?

360
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,880
If she's lying,

361
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,319
I think just scaring her a little

362
00:22:06,839 --> 00:22:08,000
will make her confess everything.

363
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:10,319
Alright.

364
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,519
Just go easy.

365
00:22:13,279 --> 00:22:13,920
Understood.

366
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:41,279
Miss Xie

367
00:22:41,599 --> 00:22:42,480
I advise you

368
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:44,440
to just tell the truth.

369
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,359
If you keep resisting,

370
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:47,440
your leg

371
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:49,079
will end up broken.

372
00:22:49,279 --> 00:22:51,079
Do you not understand what I'm saying?

373
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,440
I am telling the truth.

374
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,319
If you don't believe me,

375
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,279
there's nothing I can do.

376
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:02,839
What's wrong?

377
00:23:03,279 --> 00:23:04,839
Didn't I say

378
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,319
not to make things difficult for Miss Xie?

379
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:12,359
Why pretend in front of me?

380
00:23:15,119 --> 00:23:16,039
Miss Xie

381
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,759
As a fellow woman,

382
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,599
as long as you tell me everything you know,

383
00:23:22,599 --> 00:23:23,880
without holding anything back,

384
00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:26,680
I will naturally

385
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:30,119
let you go.

386
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:33,920
Fine.

387
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,119
What do you want me to say?

388
00:23:38,839 --> 00:23:40,359
Bring paper and pen.

389
00:23:40,759 --> 00:23:41,759
You speak,

390
00:23:42,359 --> 00:23:43,359
you write,

391
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:45,720
and I'll sign it.

392
00:23:56,319 --> 00:23:58,160
Why are you being so hesitant?

393
00:23:58,759 --> 00:23:59,920
Just be straightforward.

394
00:24:10,519 --> 00:24:11,519
Miss Xie

395
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:16,160
Don't wait until you're no longer useful

396
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:20,319
to beg me on your knees.

397
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:24,880
Even if you do beg me,

398
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,640
my answer will still be the same.

399
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:31,839
Is that so?

400
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,039
Director Hirata

401
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,519
Mr. Lu has arrived.

402
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:54,279
Mr. Lu

403
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:56,160
You're here.

404
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,319
Miss Hirata

405
00:25:00,839 --> 00:25:01,759
What's going on?

406
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:06,920
Miss Xie

407
00:25:07,319 --> 00:25:08,839
Is suspected of being with the Military Bureau.

408
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,519
We

409
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:13,119
caught the person who was meeting with her here.

410
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:15,079
It's just a pity

411
00:25:15,759 --> 00:25:17,559
that Miss Xie is too tight-lipped.

412
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,039
Without using some methods,

413
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,839
she won't talk.

414
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:26,079
Miss Xie is a friend of Liang Shuo.

415
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:28,200
I wonder, Miss Hirata,

416
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,440
have you considered that this might offend Liang Shuo?

417
00:25:34,279 --> 00:25:35,400
Or do you think,

418
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,079
that Director Liang is also suspicious?

419
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,079
This

420
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,079
is the worst-case scenario.

421
00:25:42,359 --> 00:25:42,960
But

422
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:45,079
after several dangerous incidents

423
00:25:45,079 --> 00:25:46,720
and observing Liang Shuo,

424
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,240
I'd rather believe

425
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:51,039
it's this woman

426
00:25:51,519 --> 00:25:53,480
who deliberately approached Liang Shuo.

427
00:25:55,319 --> 00:25:55,920
Is that so?

428
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,079
Don't you think

429
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,119
even Miss Hirata isn't sure,

430
00:26:03,079 --> 00:26:04,200
so how would I know?

431
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,559
All I know is

432
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,480
a person's emotions

433
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,880
often affect their judgment.

434
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:14,559
You Chinese

435
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,720
value emotions.

436
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,519
But I

437
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,960
only trust my own eyes.

438
00:26:31,079 --> 00:26:31,880
Just in time,

439
00:26:32,359 --> 00:26:33,519
Director Liang has arrived as well.

440
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,079
Director Hirata

441
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,599
Why are you here?

442
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,200
Director Lu is here too.

443
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,000
You’re not...

444
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:51,759
here to see Miss Xie, are you?

445
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,200
Mr. Liang

446
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:05,799
Mr. Liang

447
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,440
Director Liang, you can’t go in.

448
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,640
Get out of my way!

449
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:14,599
Mr. Liang

450
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,880
It’s not what you think.

451
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,000
We were nearby

452
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,880
and caught a Chongqing agent.

453
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,279
Catching a Chongqing agent,

454
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:22,799
and now you’re blaming Miss Xie?

455
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,880
Why don’t you just arrest me instead?

456
00:27:29,839 --> 00:27:30,799
Untie me now!

457
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:35,799
Director Hirata

458
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,240
I, Liang,

459
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,640
have risked my life

460
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:41,079
and devoted myself to the Empire and the new government.

461
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:43,240
If you think I, Liang Shuo, am a problem,

462
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,599
then come at me directly.

463
00:27:44,839 --> 00:27:46,559
Let’s go to the Central Law Enforcement Committee

464
00:27:46,599 --> 00:27:48,000
and to Chief Mizuno

465
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,200
and get to the bottom of this.

466
00:27:49,359 --> 00:27:51,200
But going after my family behind my back—

467
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,519
that’s something I absolutely cannot tolerate!

468
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,599
Tell me,

469
00:27:59,359 --> 00:28:00,400
who did it?

470
00:28:02,039 --> 00:28:02,839
It was me.

471
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,200
What do you want to do about it?

472
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,000
Bastard!

473
00:28:07,559 --> 00:28:08,920
If there’s a next time,

474
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:11,279
it won’t end with just a punch.

475
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:20,519
Mr. Liang

476
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:28,359
Mr. Liang

477
00:28:28,359 --> 00:28:30,000
It’s not as simple as you think.

478
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,559
Miss Hirata, please calm down.

479
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,880
Why don't we have Director Liang take Miss Xie to the hospital first?

480
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,359
We can talk about anything else when we get back to headquarters.

481
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,240
Continue the strict interrogation of that Chongqing operative.

482
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,079
Yes, sir.

483
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:19,960
What's going on?

484
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,960
Get out and take a look.

485
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,359
Mr. Liang

486
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,160
What's going on?

487
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,480
I don't know why,

488
00:29:59,079 --> 00:30:00,880
but the car seems to have broken down.

489
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,279
I'll try to contact headquarters first.

490
00:30:06,279 --> 00:30:08,079
Let's take Miss Xie to the hospital first.

491
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,640
With this kind of weather,

492
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,559
and in this place,

493
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,400
I'm afraid it's hard to get in touch.

494
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:24,000
Let's find a nearby phone booth.

495
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,640
Notify Director Mizuno immediately.

496
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,480
Contact Mizuno Shingen now.

497
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,319
Isn't it too late?

498
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,599
You understand Japanese?

499
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:40,440
I've always understood.

500
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:44,279
I see.

501
00:30:46,599 --> 00:30:49,119
Interrogating Miss Xie was a last-minute decision today.

502
00:30:49,359 --> 00:30:50,599
Other than Director Hirata,

503
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:54,079
probably only Yagi Ryo and a few others knew.

504
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:55,319
Is that so?

505
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:05,960
Mr. Liang

506
00:31:06,319 --> 00:31:08,599
You are a valued talent of the Empire of Japan.

507
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,200
I think between us

508
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,200
there must be some misunderstandings.

509
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,599
Let's not let these small matters ruin our relationship.

510
00:31:16,759 --> 00:31:18,160
On behalf of my subordinates,

511
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,480
for their rudeness to Miss Xie,

512
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,559
I apologize.

513
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:24,440
But right now, the urgent matter

514
00:31:24,599 --> 00:31:26,440
is to get Miss Xie to the hospital.

515
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:30,359
Your car broke down.

516
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,200
You can take mine.

517
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,480
Director Hirata

518
00:31:37,079 --> 00:31:38,119
That's not necessary.

519
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:49,960
Kill him.

520
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:05,640
Liang Shuo

521
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,640
I trusted you so much.

522
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,559
Do you really think that by doing this

523
00:32:10,759 --> 00:32:12,559
everything will go perfectly?

524
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,039
Director Liang, impressive skills.

525
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,559
Director Lu, your skills are impressive too.

526
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:06,960
Your leg healed really fast.

527
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:13,000
You know I won't interfere with you.

528
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,240
The note on my desk was left by you.

529
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:16,920
Of course you wouldn't interfere.

530
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,839
Otherwise, when Chen Gengsheng had an accident,

531
00:33:19,359 --> 00:33:21,960
you wouldn't have plotted to assassinate Hirata Xizi.

532
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,519
How did you know

533
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,319
I wanted to kill her,

534
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,880
and not you?

535
00:33:30,599 --> 00:33:31,279
Shadow.

536
00:33:32,839 --> 00:33:34,640
I don't understand what you're talking about.

537
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:36,079
In my opinion,

538
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,079
Director Lu seems more like

539
00:33:37,079 --> 00:33:38,799
the one wandering around No. 76,

540
00:33:39,799 --> 00:33:40,559
a shadow.

541
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,079
I've already done everything I could.

542
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,240
Don't forget to clean up after yourself.

543
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,680
No need for you to worry, Director Lu.

544
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:53,400
I'll take you somewhere safe to hide for a while.

545
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:55,480
What about you?

546
00:34:56,199 --> 00:34:57,519
With something this serious happening,

547
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,559
I have to go back to headquarters and see what's going on.

548
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,079
You're going back?

549
00:35:03,719 --> 00:35:05,119
Aren't you afraid of my senior brother?

550
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:06,159
Did he try to harm you?

551
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,840
The fact that you're being hunted by Da Feng Hall

552
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,400
is related to him.

553
00:35:12,039 --> 00:35:12,960
I'm scared.

554
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,199
He has his own motives.

555
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,320
But if tonight,

556
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,679
he hadn't stepped in to help,

557
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,239
who knows what would have happened.

558
00:35:21,199 --> 00:35:22,119
Then he...

559
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,480
What exactly is his goal?

560
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:27,920
I don't know.

561
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,119
His personality

562
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:32,000
is decisive and determined,

563
00:35:32,159 --> 00:35:33,559
but also extremely arrogant.

564
00:35:34,639 --> 00:35:36,920
But I don't think he'd go out of his way to harm us.

565
00:35:39,079 --> 00:35:40,239
You trust him?

566
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:45,960
It's just a feeling.

567
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:52,039
Do you really know him?

568
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,519
I've always thought

569
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:59,079
he's a senior I can respect and trust.

570
00:35:59,679 --> 00:36:02,079
I never imagined he would betray us.

571
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,360
Could it be that he...

572
00:36:08,679 --> 00:36:10,079
Maybe there's more to the story.

573
00:36:10,599 --> 00:36:11,719
Let's talk about it when we get back.

574
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,400
Boss

575
00:37:16,119 --> 00:37:16,880
Boss

576
00:37:17,159 --> 00:37:18,320
It's Director Hirata

577
00:37:19,159 --> 00:37:21,360
It's over, something big has happened

578
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:16,599
What is she doing?

579
00:38:16,599 --> 00:38:17,360
Go inside and talk.

580
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,320
Hirata tortured her.

581
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,119
Her bones were injured.

582
00:39:03,639 --> 00:39:04,559
I'll think of something right away.

583
00:39:04,559 --> 00:39:05,599
I'll get someone to fetch medicine.

584
00:39:08,719 --> 00:39:09,960
We owe it to you this time.

585
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,239
It was Old Tan who made the quick decision.

586
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,559
I was just following orders.

587
00:39:16,159 --> 00:39:17,599
As for Miss Xie,

588
00:39:18,199 --> 00:39:19,480
everything has been taken care of.

589
00:39:21,079 --> 00:39:22,320
She still can't go back.

590
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,360
The military police are definitely investigating along the river.

591
00:39:25,679 --> 00:39:27,400
We'd better be careful.

592
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,079
You can't stay long either.

593
00:39:29,719 --> 00:39:31,159
Hirata Xizi is dead.

594
00:39:32,199 --> 00:39:33,639
The intelligence headquarters

595
00:39:33,639 --> 00:39:35,320
will probably summon you soon.

596
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:38,800
Then, as for her,

597
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,559
I'll leave her in your care.

598
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,400
Our goal

599
00:39:46,639 --> 00:39:48,280
is to save our compatriots, isn't it?

600
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:51,760
Yes.

601
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,119
I was being foolish.

602
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,559
She probably already knows

603
00:39:58,559 --> 00:40:00,119
our true identities.

604
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:01,880
I think

605
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:02,880
we should still report

606
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,239
this situation to the organization.

607
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,280
I'll tell Old Tan.

608
00:40:10,519 --> 00:40:11,440
I'll go now.

609
00:40:14,599 --> 00:40:15,400
Liang Shuo,

610
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,480
I'm glad

611
00:40:23,039 --> 00:40:24,559
that when you needed help,

612
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:27,079
you thought of me first.
