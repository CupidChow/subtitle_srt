1
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:51,000
There are military police everywhere now.

2
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:53,560
I don't know what will happen to Qingshuang and the others.

3
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:54,920
Yeah.

4
00:01:55,719 --> 00:01:56,560
Now,

5
00:01:57,359 --> 00:01:58,640
everyone's attention

6
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,319
is focused on Asai Hisashi.

7
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:02,319
That's right.

8
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:03,319
Zhonghai.

9
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:04,000
Come here.

10
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,560
Let's talk about the action plan.

11
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,200
Okay.

12
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:06,840
We

13
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,120
will split into two squads.

14
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:09,240
The first squad

15
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:11,599
will be at the northeast corner of Quanfu Road.

16
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:12,159
Alright.

17
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:13,719
will fire at the passing soldiers.

18
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,960
The main goal

19
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:17,120
is to draw the attention of the main force of the military police.

20
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,039
And then?

21
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:19,360
Retreat toward the riverbank.

22
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:19,960
Okay.

23
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,879
This place

24
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,240
has a large shantytown.

25
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,759
It's natural cover.

26
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:25,680
The second squad will do the same.

27
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:26,759
Fight while retreating.

28
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:28,319
Lure the Japanese over.

29
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:29,960
Then,

30
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,479
at this fork in the road,

31
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:32,479
we've set up explosives.

32
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,159
If the Japanese pursue us,

33
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:35,439
we'll detonate the explosives.

34
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:36,520
to block their pursuit.

35
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,039
Alright.

36
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,639
I'll make the arrangements right away.

37
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:40,400
I'll get ready to provide support.

38
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,800
I hope

39
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,680
Comrade Qingshuang

40
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,599
will be safe and everything goes well.

41
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,759
Hello

42
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:16,919
Got it

43
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:21,759
The place he arranged to meet us

44
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:22,719
is right here

45
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:24,439
Tomorrow morning at eight

46
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:26,039
Near Quanfeng Road

47
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,800
An abandoned chemical factory

48
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,120
Asai also asked us

49
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,319
to bring a car

50
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:32,080
and guns

51
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:34,680
He can't escape Mizuno's encirclement

52
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,319
This place looks

53
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,120
like a good hiding spot

54
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:40,560
But what I don't understand is

55
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,560
Since Asai is so eager to escape Shanghai

56
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:44,960
then why

57
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,840
does he keep getting involved with us

58
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:48,840
For him

59
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,759
it's also something he has no choice about

60
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:53,120
Mizuno and the Special Operations Headquarters

61
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,680
have already sealed off this area

62
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,680
As long as we search carefully

63
00:03:56,759 --> 00:03:58,680
it's only a matter of time before we find him

64
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:02,120
He wants to use us

65
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,120
to tie up Mizuno

66
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:06,719
and then look for a chance to escape

67
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:08,120
So what do we do

68
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,560
In terms of timing

69
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,879
there's no way to prepare in advance

70
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,439
He's gambling

71
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:17,319
that we'll have to go for the list

72
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,120
If I were Asai

73
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,240
I'd contact Mizuno

74
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,680
and use the chance to catch us all at once

75
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,560
Then he

76
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:28,720
can find the right moment

77
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,839
He wants to survive by putting himself in a desperate situation

78
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,120
I want to meet him in person

79
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:56,920
Old Liu

80
00:04:57,879 --> 00:04:59,399
No matter if this works out or not,

81
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,839
leave Shanghai as soon as possible.

82
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,519
Go back to Chongqing.

83
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,800
What’s wrong?

84
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:07,879
You can’t stand the sight of me now?

85
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,839
You, the pre-war inspector,

86
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,240
are colluding with me, the battlefield commander.

87
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,759
You’re in cahoots with me.

88
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:17,040
In cahoots together.

89
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,560
You’ve caused the Shanghai station

90
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,079
to suffer heavy losses.

91
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,160
Director Dai’s anger

92
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:25,040
won’t fall on me,

93
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,759
sooner or later, he’ll come after you.

94
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:29,920
Go back early and report me.

95
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:31,959
That way, you can clear yourself of any involvement.

96
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,839
You, the commander, are deeply guilty.

97
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,399
And I, as the inspector,

98
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:41,439
should escort you back to Chongqing to stand trial.

99
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:44,160
Old Wu,

100
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,519
are you hiding something from me?

101
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:50,639
All this time,

102
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:52,720
among all of us brothers,

103
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:53,800
you’ve always been the calmest.

104
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,600
But I don’t understand—

105
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,399
since Wang Mutian’s accident,

106
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,800
have I changed?

107
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:04,120
You have changed.

108
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:06,879
Sometimes you’ve changed so much

109
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,120
that I don’t even recognize you.

110
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,079
You’re looking at things from the wrong angle.

111
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:20,199
Maybe you never really understood me.

112
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:08,879
There's still plenty of time.

113
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,040
Why don't we make a guess?

114
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,399
Will they come to save you?

115
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:16,600
If I were you,

116
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:19,000
I wouldn't be smiling so happily.

117
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:21,040
Hand over the list now.

118
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:23,399
Maybe you can still find a way out for yourself.

119
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:25,519
So you know about the list too.

120
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,959
What's your name?

121
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,639
You're going to kill me anyway,

122
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:31,079
and you still ask for my name?

123
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:33,000
That's really funny.

124
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,920
The top leader of the Bureau in Shanghai is Scorpio.

125
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,519
You're his subordinate, aren't you?

126
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:41,879
And here I thought you were a seasoned agent.

127
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,439
Using such clumsy tricks to get information?

128
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:50,920
Not everyone in the Bureau is a mindless puppet.

129
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,839
I'm actually a bit reluctant to kill you now.

130
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:53,959
I'm actually a bit reluctant to kill you now.

131
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,560
I know what you're trying to do.

132
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,600
Oh, really?

133
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:01,519
You put yourself

134
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:03,560
in this desperate situation

135
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:05,839
just to make Mizuno Shingen

136
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:07,000
let his guard down, right?

137
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,240
Let his guard down?

138
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:09,560
You know deep down

139
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:12,439
that Hongkou is already surrounded by the military police.

140
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,240
You can't possibly escape.

141
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,160
So,

142
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,639
you dragged the Bureau into this

143
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:20,160
to make it look like you'd go down together.

144
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,879
That way, Mizuno Shingen would be distracted.

145
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,680
And you could find a chance to escape.

146
00:08:27,399 --> 00:08:28,639
Am I right?

147
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:35,240
What a pity.

148
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:36,559
Pity about what?

149
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,240
It's a shame.

150
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,519
You're too confident in yourself.

151
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,000
And you underestimate us too much.

152
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,120
You are indeed a bit special.

153
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:48,480
But

154
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,639
That still won't change your fate.

155
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:52,080
My fate?

156
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,360
Even if I die here today,

157
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,360
I don't care.

158
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:56,720
As long as he's here,

159
00:08:57,039 --> 00:08:58,159
I believe in him.

160
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,200
He definitely won't let you get your way.

161
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:02,039
Who?

162
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:05,679
Fine.

163
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,639
Then let's wait and see.

164
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,960
Down with traitors and collaborators!

165
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,720
Down with traitors and collaborators!

166
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,240
Oppose the Japan-Wang agreement!

167
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:18,840
Oppose the Japan-Wang agreement!

168
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,440
Down with traitors and collaborators!

169
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,279
Down with traitors and collaborators!

170
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,759
Oppose the Japan-Wang agreement!

171
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:25,200
Oppose the Japan-Wang agreement!

172
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,840
Down with traitors and collaborators!

173
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,840
Down with traitors and collaborators!

174
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,240
Chief

175
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,159
On Quanfu Road,

176
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:36,320
there's a protest happening.

177
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,039
Quanfu Road?

178
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:42,360
Isn't that Asai Hisashi's hideout?

179
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:45,360
What are these people up to?

180
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:49,240
I'll take a team to suppress them right away.

181
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,639
The Peace Conference is about to begin.

182
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:54,080
Make sure to calm the public first.

183
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:57,399
Do not suppress them lightly.

184
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,240
Yes, sir.

185
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,159
It's you.

186
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:33,320
Xie Jun'an.

187
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Long time no see.

188
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,039
Xie Jun'an.

189
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,720
Scorpio.

190
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,759
I should have realized it was you.

191
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:46,360
Ten years ago,

192
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:48,039
I finished making arrangements.

193
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,320
It was people like you,

194
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,480
scum hiding underground,

195
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,240
that forced me to implement the Trinity List ahead of schedule.

196
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,000
And even now, it still hasn't been accomplished.

197
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,360
Same goes for you.

198
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,039
The price we've paid

199
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:03,399
has been just as heavy.

200
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:07,759
Just one Wang Mutian

201
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:11,360
was enough to turn the Bureau into this mess.

202
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,960
Did you come here alone?

203
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,080
Did you come here alone?

204
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,039
I'm here to negotiate with you.

205
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,799
Since this is a negotiation,

206
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,919
having more people would only make things worse.

207
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,240
Negotiation?

208
00:11:23,799 --> 00:11:24,799
How do you want to negotiate?

209
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,120
Mr. Asai's top priority

210
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,679
is to escape from Hongkou District.

211
00:11:30,279 --> 00:11:32,000
Taking a young girl as a hostage

212
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:32,039
Taking a young girl as a hostage

213
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,240
probably isn't enough leverage.

214
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:38,200
What are you trying to say?

215
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,480
I'm the head of the Shanghai Bureau.

216
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:41,720
I'll exchange myself for her.

217
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,600
From any perspective,

218
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:46,759
this is your best option.

219
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,159
As for me,

220
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,919
it's a very good proposal.

221
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:52,320
But

222
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,480
I want to see your sincerity.

223
00:11:56,039 --> 00:11:57,039
What do you mean?

224
00:11:58,679 --> 00:12:00,799
Have your two men come out.

225
00:12:10,279 --> 00:12:11,679
They are all my students.

226
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:12,960
For my sake.

227
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:15,840
They will agree to all your terms.

228
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:17,559
Let me exchange myself for her.

229
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:19,919
Alright.

230
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:21,080
Very good.

231
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,120
Scorpio.

232
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,879
Put down your gun.

233
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,320
Stop.

234
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:44,440
What's in your pocket?

235
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,519
Take it out.

236
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,240
Take it out.

237
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,240
I anticipated this step long ago.

238
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:10,840
You want to die?

239
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,480
It's not that easy.

240
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:14,639
Get on your knees.

241
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:17,919
Kneel.

242
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,639
Kneel.

243
00:13:31,799 --> 00:13:32,600
Teacher.

244
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,799
Teacher

245
00:13:41,559 --> 00:13:42,679
Xie Jun'an

246
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:44,879
A founding member of the Fuxing Society

247
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:47,559
An upright and principled leader of agents

248
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,759
Founder of the Military Command Training Camp

249
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,799
But do you know

250
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,759
that his name

251
00:13:55,759 --> 00:13:58,120
has long been on this list

252
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,320
What do you mean?

253
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,399
Where is the list?

254
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:06,720
Where is the list?

255
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,919
Xie Jun'an

256
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,840
You traitor

257
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:13,879
Tell me

258
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:15,440
Where is the list?

259
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:17,360
Tell me, where is the list?

260
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,120
Master and apprentice turn against each other

261
00:14:21,559 --> 00:14:23,720
Is there anything more dramatic than this?

262
00:14:24,039 --> 00:14:25,440
In your hearts

263
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,399
the teacher you have always admired and respected

264
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:27,600
the teacher you have always admired and respected

265
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:28,919
in fact, he

266
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,840
betrayed his own beliefs long ago

267
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,759
Xie Jun'an

268
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,879
You always talk about loyalty and patriotism

269
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,279
but sent countless brothers to their doom

270
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:40,360
but sent countless brothers to their doom

271
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:42,480
Turns out you are

272
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,320
a complete and utter liar

273
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:46,360
Everything you made us do

274
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,000
what was it all for?

275
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:48,200
What was it all for?

276
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,480
Liang Shuo

277
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,399
Put the gun down.

278
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,480
Are you crazy?

279
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:03,919
He's the real traitor.

280
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,759
And you aren't?

281
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:12,440
You think I don't know?

282
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,039
You've been secretly passing information to the Communists.

283
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:14,080
You've been secretly passing information to the Communists.

284
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:18,240
Lu Xijian

285
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,759
You've wanted to take my place for a long time, haven't you?

286
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,159
You've tried to assassinate me more than once.

287
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:27,440
But you've never considered whether you deserve it.

288
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,360
Jealousy has already blinded you.

289
00:15:30,519 --> 00:15:31,639
Your brother's death

290
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:33,960
was entirely your own doing.

291
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,279
Then let's settle this once and for all today.

292
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:27,080
Reporting to the chief

293
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,759
Gunshots detected nearby

294
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:31,559
Go investigate

295
00:16:31,559 --> 00:16:32,159
Yes, sir

296
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,679
Drive straight ahead

297
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:47,360
Down with traitors and national betrayers!

298
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,240
Down with traitors and national betrayers!

299
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,720
Oppose the Japan-Wang agreement!

300
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,360
Oppose the Japan-Wang agreement!

301
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,960
Down with traitors and national betrayers!

302
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,559
Down with traitors and national betrayers!

303
00:16:55,559 --> 00:16:57,080
Oppose the Japan-Wang agreement!

304
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,440
Oppose the Japan-Wang agreement!

305
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,080
Down with traitors and national betrayers!

306
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,759
Down with traitors and national betrayers!

307
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:03,200
Oppose the Japan-Wang agreement!

308
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,759
Oppose the Japan-Wang agreement!

309
00:17:04,759 --> 00:17:06,480
Down with traitors and national betrayers!

310
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,440
Down with traitors and national betrayers!

311
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,000
Oppose the Japan-Wang agreement!

312
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,519
Oppose the Japan-Wang agreement!

313
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:13,240
Down with traitors and national betrayers!

314
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,880
Down with traitors and national betrayers!

315
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,640
Oppose the Japan-Wang agreement!

316
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,200
Oppose the Japan-Wang agreement!

317
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,920
Down with traitors and national betrayers!

318
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,640
Down with traitors and national betrayers!

319
00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:23,359
Oppose the Japan-Wang agreement!

320
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:25,119
Oppose the Japan-Wang agreement!

321
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:26,920
Chief

322
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,720
The gunshots came from the chemical plant.

323
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,000
But the road is completely blocked by the parade.

324
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,480
This...

325
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,519
Arrest the leaders immediately.

326
00:17:33,079 --> 00:17:34,599
Disperse the parade. If they resist,

327
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:35,680
show no mercy.

328
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:36,799
Yes, sir.

329
00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:39,519
Down with traitors and national betrayers!

330
00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:41,079
Down with traitors and national betrayers!

331
00:17:41,079 --> 00:17:42,200
Oppose the Japan-Wang agreement!

332
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,119
Oppose the Japan-Wang agreement!

333
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,720
Down with traitors and national betrayers!

334
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:50,000
If you dare to block us again,

335
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,519
you will be killed without mercy.

336
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,480
The Japanese are shooting!

337
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,880
Fight them!

338
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,759
Fight!

339
00:18:00,759 --> 00:18:02,960
Fight! Fight! Fight!

340
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:14,680
Fall back!

341
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:15,720
Move back!

342
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,319
Fall back!

343
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:17,119
Move back!

344
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:17,880
Fall back!

345
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:38,400
Teacher!

346
00:18:42,359 --> 00:18:43,160
Teacher!

347
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:45,720
Teacher!

348
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,680
Teacher!

349
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:54,880
Teacher!

350
00:18:58,599 --> 00:19:00,359
Because of a single thought,

351
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,680
just one wrong decision,

352
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:06,400
back then, with Asai Shou,

353
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,799
I made a deal.

354
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:10,960
It led to a terrible mistake.

355
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,119
Teacher...

356
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:16,160
Teacher...

357
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:18,039
Don't blame me.

358
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:20,759
Nishima...

359
00:19:23,839 --> 00:19:25,039
You must

360
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:26,720
find

361
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,480
the list

362
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,359
and destroy it.

363
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:32,240
Okay.

364
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:33,799
Teacher...

365
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:35,680
Asai Shou

366
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,400
had a student.

367
00:19:38,599 --> 00:19:39,720
His name is...

368
00:19:47,799 --> 00:19:48,599
Teacher...

369
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:49,599
Teacher...

370
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,039
Teacher...

371
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,480
You started following me when you were fourteen.

372
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,319
I will never forget

373
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:22,880
the time I gave you a steamed bun.

374
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,799
The look in your eyes as you devoured it,

375
00:20:25,079 --> 00:20:26,880
eyes like a wolf.

376
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:29,000
At that moment, I knew

377
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,960
that you would one day become

378
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,279
a loyal agent.

379
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,680
I hope

380
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,480
you can be my eyes.

381
00:20:38,359 --> 00:20:40,559
I only trust you.

382
00:20:41,559 --> 00:20:43,559
Scorpio has already lost his mind.

383
00:20:44,279 --> 00:20:45,920
Ever since the fall of the Shanghai station,

384
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,720
he has lost all reason.

385
00:20:48,039 --> 00:20:50,319
There are twelve bodies lying in the courtyard now.

386
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:53,039
All of them are kids who barely ever held a gun.

387
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:54,759
Even if the times are tough,

388
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,839
even if we've lost our support,

389
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,559
bringing them here

390
00:20:58,839 --> 00:21:01,000
is no different from sending them to their deaths.

391
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,880
What do our lives mean to you, really?

392
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:25,119
Lu Xijian, what are you trying to do?

393
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,480
Put the gun down.

394
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,359
Mizuno.

395
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,440
Listen carefully.

396
00:21:30,759 --> 00:21:32,519
Asai Shou is already dead by my hand.

397
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,039
If you want Director Liang to live,

398
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,759
then get out of my way.

399
00:21:37,079 --> 00:21:37,960
Lu Xijian.

400
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,000
You really are a scholar.

401
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,279
Are you showing your cards to me now?

402
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:47,039
It's time for us to settle things between us.

403
00:21:48,519 --> 00:21:49,400
What makes you think

404
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,880
I care about his life?

405
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,599
If that's what you say, Chief Mizuno,

406
00:21:55,799 --> 00:21:57,279
then I’d like to make a bet with you.

407
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,519
Chief Mizuno.

408
00:22:00,839 --> 00:22:02,160
Our boss is still on the other side.

409
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,119
Please don’t act rashly.

410
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:05,640
Get out of the way.

411
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,279
You have really disappointed me.

412
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,160
You were the informant I personally placed.

413
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,119
But you have been deceiving my trust all along.

414
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:17,599
You once said

415
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:21,160
Everyone must pay the price for their own foolishness.

416
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,519
Let me ask you one last question.

417
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,119
Was Hirata killed by your gun?

418
00:22:34,759 --> 00:22:35,920
Not just Hirata.

419
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:37,599
Chief Mizuno,

420
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,079
you were too careless.

421
00:22:40,119 --> 00:22:40,960
What a pity.

422
00:22:41,799 --> 00:22:44,319
I originally wanted to send you to reunite with Hirata myself.

423
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,000
But it seems there’s no chance now.

424
00:22:47,559 --> 00:22:48,680
What a shame.

425
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,799
You should have seen for yourself

426
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:54,440
how Hirata died at the end of my gun.

427
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,480
It would have been unforgettable for you.

428
00:22:57,519 --> 00:22:58,799
You scum.

429
00:23:00,119 --> 00:23:01,319
Shoot him for me.

430
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:02,920
Fire!

431
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,559
You owe me a life.

432
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:36,920
Stay alive.

433
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,759
Find Kobayashi and Qing.

434
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:48,799
You've wanted to kill me for a long time, haven't you?

435
00:23:49,359 --> 00:23:51,160
Now is the best chance.

436
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,119
I won't kill you.

437
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,039
Right now, I want you to be my hostage.

438
00:23:57,119 --> 00:23:57,920
Only this way

439
00:23:58,519 --> 00:23:59,880
will Mizuno not suspect you.

440
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,319
I don't need that.

441
00:24:03,079 --> 00:24:03,880
Lu Xijian,

442
00:24:04,519 --> 00:24:05,279
this kind of self-sacrifice trick

443
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:06,759
Mizuno won't believe it.

444
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:08,000
We can only take a gamble.

445
00:24:08,039 --> 00:24:09,519
I know what you're thinking.

446
00:24:09,759 --> 00:24:11,119
But there's no need to do this.

447
00:24:11,559 --> 00:24:12,960
We still have other ways.

448
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:14,240
There's no time to think about it anymore.

449
00:24:14,359 --> 00:24:16,039
My brother gave his life for you.

450
00:24:16,839 --> 00:24:18,400
I won't allow any mistakes.

451
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,359
I want you to promise me two things.

452
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,559
Find the Trinity list.

453
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,480
Fulfill our teacher's last wish.

454
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:26,920
And also,

455
00:24:27,319 --> 00:24:28,359
Take good care of Nian Ci.

456
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,480
Whether you can get away in the future

457
00:24:31,599 --> 00:24:32,519
will depend on your own luck.

458
00:24:51,559 --> 00:24:52,480
He's dead.

459
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,440
Mr. Mizuno

460
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,119
My fiancée's life is still uncertain.

461
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,599
I have to be by her side.

462
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,440
I promise you,

463
00:26:46,119 --> 00:26:47,799
as soon as I confirm she's safe,

464
00:26:48,079 --> 00:26:49,440
I will definitely, without omission,

465
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,960
report everything that happened today

466
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,079
to you.

467
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:54,279
Please let me go see her now.

468
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,039
I understand how you feel right now.

469
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,920
But you also know the current situation.

470
00:27:03,119 --> 00:27:04,319
Something so serious has happened.

471
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:05,200
You don't have

472
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,880
the right to act on your own.

473
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:11,200
Besides, Miss Xie is still being treated.

474
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,839
Even if you go,

475
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:14,039
you still won't be able to see her.

476
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:17,920
How about this:

477
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:20,519
You answer a few questions for me,

478
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:21,759
and I promise

479
00:27:21,759 --> 00:27:22,880
to let you see her.

480
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,680
Can you talk now?

481
00:27:28,359 --> 00:27:30,079
What exactly happened?

482
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:36,440
They took Yuxin hostage.

483
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,279
They wanted to make a deal with No. 76.

484
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,119
They wanted me to go alone.

485
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:46,519
But before I left for the meeting,

486
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,240
I had already reported it to headquarters.

487
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:53,720
The situation

488
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:54,559
is true.

489
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:01,680
Then how did Miss Xie get taken hostage?

490
00:28:06,839 --> 00:28:08,519
I haven't been home for several days.

491
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,839
She came to Siming Road to find me.

492
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:12,599
As a result,

493
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,319
she was targeted by Asai Hisashi.

494
00:28:20,359 --> 00:28:23,160
Is it because of the arson at the Seamen's Club?

495
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,359
You think your plan is flawless.

496
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,720
But you can't fool me.

497
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,039
The chief is indeed clever.

498
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:39,319
Asai Hisashi is someone who always seeks revenge.

499
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,720
He's very difficult to deal with.

500
00:28:41,559 --> 00:28:42,720
Even if he has his eyes on you,

501
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,559
it's not surprising.

502
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,599
After all, your profession is very sensitive.

503
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,960
After I arrived at the chemical plant,

504
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,680
I found that the Military Bureau had gotten there first.

505
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,279
They had a conflict with Asai Hisashi.

506
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,559
And this person

507
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,039
is exactly the one I've been tracking

508
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,920
since I returned from Yulong Mountain.

509
00:29:09,599 --> 00:29:11,000
You're talking about Scorpio.

510
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,000
That's right.

511
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:14,160
Lu Xijian was there too.

512
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:15,920
I didn't expect it.

513
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:17,960
He turned out to be one of Scorpio's people as well.

514
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,880
Then how did Asai Shou die?

515
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:23,559
He was killed by Scorpio and Lu Xijian working together.

516
00:29:24,079 --> 00:29:24,880
During the chaos,

517
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,319
Scorpio was shot and fell to the ground.

518
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:27,519
Yuxin fell from the building.

519
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,440
In my haste,

520
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,599
I lost my composure for a moment.

521
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:33,039
As a result, I was overpowered by Lu Xijian.

522
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,240
I have no words of complaint.

523
00:29:39,079 --> 00:29:40,200
Mr. Mizuno,

524
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:41,759
Are you suspecting me?

525
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,799
Director Liang,

526
00:29:45,319 --> 00:29:46,240
You’re being too serious.

527
00:29:47,599 --> 00:29:49,839
Although we didn't capture Asai Shou alive,

528
00:29:50,519 --> 00:29:51,359
at least

529
00:29:52,599 --> 00:29:54,519
the head of the military agents is dead.

530
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,519
This is also thanks to your efforts, Director Liang.

531
00:29:57,759 --> 00:29:59,519
We will make sure to reward you for your contributions.

532
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,400
Yuxin's fate is still unknown.

533
00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:02,839
My heart is already dead.

534
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:04,720
What does merit matter now?

535
00:30:05,119 --> 00:30:06,279
Let it all go.

536
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:08,319
Report.

537
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:18,359
Director Liang

538
00:30:18,839 --> 00:30:19,880
Good news.

539
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:23,279
Miss Xie has been resuscitated.

540
00:30:23,759 --> 00:30:26,240
Although her injuries are severe and she's still unconscious,

541
00:30:26,519 --> 00:30:28,279
at least she's still alive.

542
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:31,000
That's great.

543
00:30:32,759 --> 00:30:33,799
Thank you, Chief.

544
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:36,240
Cats have nine lives.

545
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,240
In my opinion,

546
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:41,319
Miss Xie is even luckier than a cat.

547
00:30:42,519 --> 00:30:43,400
Mr. Mizuno

548
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:45,920
May I go see her?

549
00:30:46,359 --> 00:30:47,319
Of course.

550
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,119
We agreed on this.

551
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,759
You saved me.

552
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:11,920
Who else would it be?

553
00:31:12,839 --> 00:31:13,759
I'm sorry.

554
00:31:14,359 --> 00:31:15,640
There's nothing to be sorry for.

555
00:31:16,519 --> 00:31:17,480
You were hurt.

556
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,799
Desperate times call for desperate measures.

557
00:31:19,079 --> 00:31:20,480
Besides, you've saved me before.

558
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,000
So, consider this my way of repaying you.

559
00:31:31,839 --> 00:31:32,680
Don't move.

560
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:33,880
Put down the gun.

561
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,359
He's the director of operations at the Special Agent Headquarters.

562
00:31:37,359 --> 00:31:38,440
His name is Liang Shuo.

563
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,519
You have to save him.

564
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,119
As long as you stay true to your conscience,

565
00:31:43,559 --> 00:31:45,319
do whatever you want to do.

566
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:47,160
If you do it, you'll never regret it.

567
00:31:47,759 --> 00:31:50,079
Otherwise, in this day and age,

568
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,519
what's the point of living?

569
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:53,200
If possible,

570
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,400
I'd like to choose again.

571
00:31:56,319 --> 00:31:57,839
I want to understand you all better.

572
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,599
To understand the Communist Party better.

573
00:32:00,119 --> 00:32:01,559
It's never too late.

574
00:32:02,119 --> 00:32:03,400
Then you have to promise me.

575
00:32:04,279 --> 00:32:05,759
Let me be your partner one more time.

576
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,839
I've always wanted to say

577
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:09,720
thank you.

578
00:32:10,839 --> 00:32:11,960
We're partners.

579
00:32:12,079 --> 00:32:13,160
No need to thank me.

580
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,440
Your situation is different from mine now.

581
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,119
You're in more danger than I am.

582
00:32:17,319 --> 00:32:18,799
Before you regain your freedom,

583
00:32:18,839 --> 00:32:20,039
you have to protect yourself.

584
00:32:33,079 --> 00:32:34,799
I got your message.

585
00:32:36,519 --> 00:32:38,119
But it was already too late.

586
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,160
So many people have sacrificed their lives.

587
00:32:42,359 --> 00:32:43,240
I know.

588
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,759
Everything will pass.

589
00:32:48,319 --> 00:32:50,119
Now is not the time to grieve.

590
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,359
We will avenge them.

591
00:32:54,079 --> 00:32:54,759
Right?

592
00:32:56,279 --> 00:32:57,079
Of course.

593
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:02,680
I want to continue on Sister Man's path.

594
00:33:03,799 --> 00:33:04,880
I want to join the Party.

595
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:08,359
To carry on for her and for myself.

596
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:10,799
When the nation is in peril,

597
00:33:11,599 --> 00:33:12,759
how can there be a home?

598
00:33:14,039 --> 00:33:16,079
I just want to face it together with you.

599
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,400
To fight by your side until the end.

600
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:22,279
I want to become a true comrade with you.

601
00:33:22,279 --> 00:33:23,039
Comrade-in-arms.

602
00:33:24,039 --> 00:33:25,000
Mission accomplished.

603
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,839
Let's return to Yan'an together.

604
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,640
Didn't you ask

605
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,319
which of the two movies I wanted to see?

606
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:39,960
I want to see both.

607
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,799
Let that be our promise.

608
00:33:44,039 --> 00:33:45,599
Let me tell you, Xie Nianci.

609
00:33:48,119 --> 00:33:49,440
If you don't get up soon,

610
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,559
"Mulan Joins the Army" will stop showing.

611
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,480
Liang Shuo.

612
00:33:59,559 --> 00:34:01,720
For you to appear in my life,

613
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,319
I'm truly grateful.

614
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,639
And this photo,

615
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:17,400
I'll put it in a frame.

616
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,320
Can I put it by your bedside?

617
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:26,800
Do you know,

618
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,400
you look so beautiful in a qipao.

619
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,400
Truly beautiful.

620
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:52,239
Didn't you say you would protect me?

621
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:56,960
Didn't you say we would fight side by side?

622
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,320
Didn't you say

623
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:02,360
no matter what,

624
00:35:03,039 --> 00:35:04,960
we must pass the test?

625
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,000
You promised me

626
00:35:10,239 --> 00:35:12,000
that we would go to Yan'an together.

627
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:16,440
You can't break your promise.

628
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:20,880
Do you hear me?

629
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:56,960
Comrade Qingshuang

630
00:36:06,519 --> 00:36:07,519
Why are you here?

631
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,960
The organization has already arranged the retreat route.

632
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,320
If there's any danger,

633
00:36:12,679 --> 00:36:14,239
you can leave Shanghai at any time.

634
00:36:16,039 --> 00:36:17,800
I know I should follow orders,

635
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:19,960
but I can't leave.

636
00:36:20,639 --> 00:36:22,480
Because my mission isn't finished yet.

637
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,360
Old Tan already expected you would say that.

638
00:36:30,199 --> 00:36:32,199
Besides, with Nian Ci like this now,

639
00:36:32,519 --> 00:36:33,559
I have even more reason to stay.

640
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,920
I know you can't stop worrying about Xie Nian Ci.

641
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,239
Don't worry.

642
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:40,440
We'll organize people to carry out a rescue at the hospital.

643
00:36:40,719 --> 00:36:41,960
This place

644
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,519
has our underground comrades.

645
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,800
It's not just Nian Ci.

646
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,719
I still haven't found the whereabouts of the list.

647
00:36:49,199 --> 00:36:50,840
The Qianyuan mission isn't finished yet.

648
00:36:51,519 --> 00:36:52,920
What reason do I have to leave?

649
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:56,119
Did Asai Shou leave any clues?

650
00:36:56,519 --> 00:36:58,000
It still needs time to confirm.

651
00:36:59,079 --> 00:37:00,800
Even if I have to approach Mizuno Shingen,

652
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,519
I still have to go.

653
00:37:06,199 --> 00:37:07,840
This is a risky move.

654
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:09,679
Tell Old Tan

655
00:37:11,079 --> 00:37:12,159
When enemies meet on a narrow path,

656
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,679
we have no way out.

657
00:37:32,559 --> 00:37:34,920
The fatal wound was a gunshot to the chest and lungs.

658
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,320
It was from a Browning standard-issue pistol.

659
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,400
It's the same type of gun used by Lu Xijian.

660
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,920
But Liang Shuo's issued weapon

661
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:43,280
is also a Browning standard-issue pistol, number 76.

662
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,519
The pistols and bullets are identical.

663
00:37:49,079 --> 00:37:50,719
What a coincidence.

664
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,159
Chief,

665
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:55,679
do you believe what Liang Shuo said?

666
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:58,639
In this world,

667
00:37:58,639 --> 00:38:01,599
the only ones who can keep secrets

668
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:02,639
are the dead.

669
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:03,960
I'm afraid this list

670
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:06,760
will forever be buried underground with Senior Asai.

671
00:38:08,559 --> 00:38:09,360
By the way,

672
00:38:09,719 --> 00:38:11,239
about Senior Asai's

673
00:38:11,239 --> 00:38:12,679
personal effects—have they all been checked?

674
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:13,559
Yes.

675
00:38:13,559 --> 00:38:15,039
Besides the stolen weapons,

676
00:38:15,039 --> 00:38:15,920
there was also some money.

677
00:38:16,159 --> 00:38:17,480
Nothing special.

678
00:38:19,199 --> 00:38:21,440
But the Chief knows

679
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:23,159
we still have a glimmer of hope.

680
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:27,679
Chief,

681
00:38:27,679 --> 00:38:29,079
do you trust Liang Shuo?

682
00:38:36,039 --> 00:38:37,119
Jiang Feiman

683
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:38,360
Lu Xijian

684
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,199
Scorpio

685
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,599
All these people have appeared

686
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:45,280
around him.

687
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,719
Don't you think that's suspicious?

688
00:38:47,559 --> 00:38:49,280
So, what could be the reason?

689
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,239
After all, he's a member of the executive committee.

690
00:38:52,239 --> 00:38:53,639
Without solid evidence,

691
00:38:53,639 --> 00:38:54,559
we

692
00:38:54,559 --> 00:38:55,840
can't do anything.

693
00:38:56,239 --> 00:38:57,679
Why not find an excuse

694
00:38:57,679 --> 00:38:59,039
to use force on him?

695
00:38:59,199 --> 00:39:00,719
If we use force on him,

696
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,800
the Nanjing side

697
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,440
will definitely object.

698
00:39:04,519 --> 00:39:06,719
Our future work

699
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:08,000
will become much more difficult.

700
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,440
By the way,

701
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,440
I just remembered something.

702
00:39:17,519 --> 00:39:18,480
Last time,

703
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,920
Mr. Harada gave me a gift.

704
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:20,719
Do you remember?

705
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,800
A powerful sedative.

706
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,599
This is the latest version of a truth serum.

707
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:33,280
It can effectively eliminate

708
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,480
the suspect's willpower.

709
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,519
After injection,

710
00:39:36,719 --> 00:39:38,880
we'll get great results during interrogation.

711
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,719
I understand what needs to be done.

712
00:40:04,039 --> 00:40:06,800
How can I gain the chief's trust?

713
00:40:08,719 --> 00:40:09,599
It's simple.

714
00:40:14,559 --> 00:40:15,840
You just need to

715
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,039
get a little injection.

716
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,320
Answer my questions.

717
00:40:20,719 --> 00:40:22,760
It's just like treating a common cold.

718
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,320
A sedative.

719
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,320
It's just much stronger.

720
00:40:31,239 --> 00:40:32,039
Alright.

721
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,960
But I'd like to use the restroom first.

722
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,400
You need to protect your head.

723
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:39,960
If it happens again,

724
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:41,119
if you get hurt,

725
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,679
the consequences will be very serious.

726
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:43,559
At best,

727
00:40:43,559 --> 00:40:44,199
you'll forget things.

728
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:45,840
At worst,

729
00:40:46,159 --> 00:40:47,280
you'll become a vegetable.

730
00:41:04,639 --> 00:41:06,199
My only option is to make myself lose my memory.

731
00:41:06,519 --> 00:41:08,480
That's the only way to get through this interrogation.

732
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:12,239
If you want to stay hidden,

733
00:41:13,039 --> 00:41:15,760
you must have the courage to face the abyss.

734
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:19,039
Even if it means dying,

735
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:21,440
you can't reveal a single bit of information.
