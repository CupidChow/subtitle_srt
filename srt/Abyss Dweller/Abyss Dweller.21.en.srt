1
00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:56,040
Thank you.

2
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:56,760
Thanks.

3
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,919
All my previous arrangements have gone to waste.

4
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,159
There are less than ten days left.

5
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,719
There's no time to lose.

6
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:19,639
I want to know

7
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,879
where the confidential documents are hidden at the Peace Conference.

8
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:23,879
Not the personnel movements of the Nanjing government.

9
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:27,879
He should use his identity to go to Meihua Hall.

10
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:29,360
To the Special Agent Committee.

11
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:32,400
To the Foreign Affairs Ministry and military banquets and card tables.

12
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,680
Hirata Xizi has just passed away.

13
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,280
Now everyone's attention

14
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,560
is focused on No. 76.

15
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:38,719
If there's too much commotion,

16
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:39,840
it will only bring trouble upon ourselves.

17
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,719
He's in a very dangerous situation now.

18
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:43,360
Forcing him to complete the mission

19
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,759
will only increase the risk of him being exposed early.

20
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,960
That's because he and Lu Xijian acted on their own.

21
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,960
They brought it upon themselves.

22
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:53,439
If Hirata Xizi were still alive,

23
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:55,599
the situation would be much more favorable than it is now.

24
00:02:57,039 --> 00:02:59,280
We've made so many arrangements and sacrifices.

25
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,039
Is this all just a game?

26
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,159
A dozen lives, before and after,

27
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:04,639
were all to support him.

28
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:06,439
If I had known it would turn out like this,

29
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,879
why would I have let He Yanjia...

30
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:13,840
What do you mean?

31
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,400
He Yanjia, Senior He,

32
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:18,479
died following orders.

33
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:21,000
You sent him to his death.

34
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:22,759
Just to control Liang Shuo.

35
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:28,960
That's not important.

36
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:32,879
Then what is important?

37
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,479
The lives of people like us.

38
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:35,240
In your eyes,

39
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,039
are they really so worthless?

40
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:39,560
Completing the mission

41
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:41,479
is to save more people.

42
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,719
Death is for new life.

43
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,080
Don't let their deaths be meaningless.

44
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:48,080
That's the greatest respect for life.

45
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:51,439
Don't you think that's hypocritical?

46
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,400
Lao Xie,

47
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,080
you're becoming more and more of a stranger to me.

48
00:03:58,759 --> 00:04:00,240
That's because you're too young.

49
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,719
You don't understand how dangerous the world is.

50
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,879
I know you're trying to protect Liang Shuo.

51
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:11,280
Let me tell you,

52
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,960
if you want to ensure his safety,

53
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,360
you should find a way

54
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,599
to make him follow orders.

55
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,959
I'm not just protecting Liang Shuo.

56
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:23,279
I'm doing this for everyone.

57
00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:29,839
You must make him follow orders.

58
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:32,399
Otherwise,

59
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,800
he'll end up hurting himself.

60
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:54,879
Life is not just about surviving.

61
00:04:55,399 --> 00:04:56,800
It's about seeking light and forging the soul.

62
00:04:57,079 --> 00:04:58,680
And passing on the torch with determination.

63
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,480
The photo.

64
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,399
It seems the Japanese are planning something big.

65
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:37,920
This news came just in time.

66
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:39,759
I need to report it as soon as possible.

67
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:44,759
Nian Ci,

68
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:47,079
what's wrong?

69
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:49,720
It's nothing.

70
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,759
Did something happen?

71
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,000
Please

72
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,240
The organization sent you here

73
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,839
Are there any new instructions

74
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,079
The higher-ups support your proposal about the list

75
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:16,240
They are giving it full support

76
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,759
This list holds great power

77
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,480
The organization's intention

78
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,800
is that we must seize it from the Japanese

79
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:24,519
With this list

80
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,720
we can reopen communications between the Nationalists and the Communists

81
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:29,399
which will help rebuild the united front against Japan

82
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:30,720
Moreover

83
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:32,639
the Japanese spies hidden in the country

84
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,279
must all be eliminated

85
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,519
Please rest assured

86
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,720
we will definitely

87
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:44,639
find a way

88
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:45,800
to complete the mission

89
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,519
By the way

90
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,639
our comrades in Tianjin just received news

91
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:51,759
the Japanese

92
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,680
are likely planning a major move

93
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,000
We also

94
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,600
received intelligence on this

95
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,319
This is

96
00:07:06,519 --> 00:07:07,399
Comrade Qingshuang

97
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,399
has obtained intelligence

98
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:09,920
Meihua Hall

99
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:11,160
has recently been sending messages to Hong Kong, China

100
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:12,160
Chongqing, and other places

101
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,000
with increased frequency

102
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,040
significantly

103
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:15,759
This is

104
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,560
an encrypted message from No. 76

105
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,360
Comrade Qingshuang believes

106
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:20,360
it must

107
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,680
be related to the Peace Conference

108
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:22,720
and hopes the organization

109
00:07:22,839 --> 00:07:24,079
can decode it as soon as possible

110
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,319
Comrades in Tianjin said

111
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,639
the Japanese side

112
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,920
will soon send an important figure to China

113
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,680
but they don't know who it is

114
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:32,920
They only know

115
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:33,759
that previously

116
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:35,480
this person worked at Dong'an Trading Company

117
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:37,279
It's unclear if this is related to the encrypted message

118
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:38,560
Dong'an Trading Company

119
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:40,399
the one in Shanghai

120
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,000
an established intelligence agency

121
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:43,000
Yes

122
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:44,160
the Nationalist Party

123
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,000
Most of the senior officials who defected

124
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:47,439
were in some way connected to this company

125
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,160
to some extent

126
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,120
That's quite intriguing.

127
00:07:56,519 --> 00:07:57,519
As far as I know,

128
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:58,480
the people from the Military Bureau

129
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,759
are also investigating this matter.

130
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:03,079
If necessary,

131
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,959
we can get some information from them

132
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,399
to understand the situation.

133
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,720
Doing this

134
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,120
wouldn't be too risky, would it?

135
00:08:11,079 --> 00:08:11,879
Indeed.

136
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:13,600
Comrade Qingshuang

137
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,279
has a special status right now.

138
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:16,639
We must

139
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:18,000
act with caution.

140
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:18,959
Therefore,

141
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:21,360
regarding the proposal to recruit Miss Xie,

142
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:23,199
I personally think it's feasible.

143
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:23,920
Of course,

144
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,079
we first need to get

145
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:26,120
the organization's approval.

146
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:27,040
Alright.

147
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:29,519
I'll report to the organization right away.

148
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:31,079
On your end,

149
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:32,519
is there anything else you need me to convey?

150
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:33,360
Feel free to mention it.

151
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,600
The Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region

152
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,720
has always been very concerned about the underground work in Shanghai

153
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,159
and the refugee rescue efforts.

154
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:39,919
Please assure the organization

155
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,240
that our work

156
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,080
is progressing smoothly.

157
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,039
Comrade Qingshuang

158
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:46,440
has already obtained

159
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,399
some of the Peace Conference's

160
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:48,879
deployment information.

161
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,000
We are currently

162
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,039
looking for a suitable rescue route.

163
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:52,759
Alright.

164
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,519
Looking forward to your good news.

165
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:24,799
Cigarettes for sale!

166
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,120
Cigarettes for sale!

167
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,399
Cigarettes for sale!

168
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:28,840
Let's go.

169
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:42,919
Fifth Brother.

170
00:09:43,639 --> 00:09:44,440
Brother Liu.

171
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:45,559
We meet again.

172
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:46,799
You've had a hard journey.

173
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,440
Let's talk at home.

174
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:49,279
Alright.

175
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,600
Drive.

176
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:58,759
Chief.

177
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,679
Weren't you supposed to return the day after tomorrow?

178
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
You go out first.

179
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,200
No one is allowed to disturb me.

180
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,559
Yes, understood.

181
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,080
Seventh Brother.

182
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,679
This was my previous base.

183
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:14,879
Now,

184
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:15,879
I'll hand it over to you.

185
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:20,679
There's not much time left.

186
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:22,639
Boss Dai.

187
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:23,919
Now he only cares about

188
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:26,120
whether the Peace Conference can be sabotaged.

189
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,879
He sent me here

190
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,200
first, to help you manage the Shanghai station,

191
00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:32,519
and brought you some people and equipment.

192
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,120
Second,

193
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:36,799
he doesn't fully trust you.

194
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:37,799
He wants me to act as

195
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:38,919
the wartime inspector.

196
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,559
That's his style.

197
00:10:42,759 --> 00:10:43,399
Chengchun.

198
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,639
Wait for me outside.

199
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:45,159
Yes.

200
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:49,399
About the Peace Conference,

201
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:52,159
we've made some new discoveries.

202
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:53,639
New discoveries?

203
00:10:58,679 --> 00:10:59,960
Hello, it's me.

204
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,519
Senior Asai.

205
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:04,120
Thank you for calling as promised.

206
00:11:05,879 --> 00:11:09,320
Mizuno, you must have been waiting anxiously.

207
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,279
I just don't want to waste any time.

208
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:15,600
For the sake of this list,

209
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,519
I've been in hiding for ten years.

210
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:20,720
And yet you can't even wait a few days.

211
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,600
I just still have some doubts.

212
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:26,279
Doubts?

213
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,519
What doubts?

214
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:30,440
Back then,

215
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,440
the Japanese agent codenamed Black Fox,

216
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:33,720
do you still remember?

217
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,360
You mean...

218
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,120
the "Eagle of Espionage," Asai Hisashi?

219
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:40,679
Is he still alive?

220
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,440
I don't know.

221
00:11:43,879 --> 00:11:44,879
Lu Xijian

222
00:11:44,919 --> 00:11:46,200
brought some news.

223
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,200
He said that at the Peace Conference,

224
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,000
there's a good chance they'll use

225
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,919
a spy list that's been hidden for ten years.

226
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,440
In the nineteenth year of the Republic,

227
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,440
Black Fox was already working to turn

228
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,080
some key officials in our government.

229
00:11:59,799 --> 00:12:01,200
We only managed to catch seven

230
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,759
traitors who were closely connected to him.

231
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,399
It's been exactly ten years.

232
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,200
That can't just be a coincidence, can it?

233
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,759
Ten years...

234
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:12,120
We've both been promoted from major to brigadier general.

235
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,360
Those

236
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,279
traitors who still haven't been found,

237
00:12:15,559 --> 00:12:16,960
what could have happened to them by now?

238
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:18,879
This list,

239
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,080
if it's really as powerful as you say, Senior Asai,

240
00:12:21,159 --> 00:12:23,080
has the potential to change the entire situation in China.

241
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,799
I have my doubts about that.

242
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,840
I never thought that at my age,

243
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:31,960
someone would still use

244
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,720
such a low-level provocation on me.

245
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,000
Is Mizuno looking down on me,

246
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,759
or on himself?

247
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:44,440
Old Five,

248
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:45,759
about this matter,

249
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:47,480
we need to verify it quickly.

250
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:48,879
If it's true,

251
00:12:48,919 --> 00:12:50,519
then things will change drastically in Chongqing.

252
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,200
If it's true,

253
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,919
the danger won't just come from the Japanese.

254
00:12:56,279 --> 00:12:57,279
It might even more likely

255
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:59,000
come from within our own ranks.

256
00:12:59,559 --> 00:13:01,279
Let me put it another way.

257
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,480
Nothing can go wrong at the Peace Conference.

258
00:13:04,039 --> 00:13:05,679
Since we're working together,

259
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:10,080
at least show me some sincerity.

260
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,879
As you wish.

261
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,799
I've prepared a small gift for you.

262
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,039
I'm honored to receive a gift. I'm looking forward to it.

263
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:24,200
Has the Shanghai station recently

264
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,080
intercepted any secret telegrams from Dong Jing?

265
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:28,000
We've intercepted quite a few.

266
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,279
But we know nothing.

267
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,240
The Japanese military changes their codes too frequently.

268
00:13:33,039 --> 00:13:34,919
It's impossible to find any pattern.

269
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:39,519
Chongqing faces the same problem.

270
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:41,960
The intelligence we've just gathered

271
00:13:42,039 --> 00:13:43,200
by the time it's deciphered,

272
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,879
it's already lost its strategic value.

273
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,080
Old Five,

274
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:48,320
our situation is tough.

275
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,360
If you come to Shanghai,

276
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,200
you'll understand my difficulties.

277
00:13:55,799 --> 00:13:56,440
Alright.

278
00:13:57,159 --> 00:13:58,600
So what should we do next?

279
00:13:58,879 --> 00:13:59,720
I'll follow your lead.

280
00:14:00,279 --> 00:14:01,559
Just like before.

281
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:28,080
The station chief's mailbox

282
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,679
Why would a mailman come here to deliver something?

283
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,399
Could it be from a missing comrade in the party?

284
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,799
Maybe it's an urgent message.

285
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:37,200
I'll go take a look.

286
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:11,440
Hurry up, hurry up, everyone move faster.

287
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,039
Get moving.

288
00:15:12,039 --> 00:15:13,519
Stop dawdling.

289
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:14,200
Hurry up.

290
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:15,759
Over there, you guys.

291
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:16,720
What are you doing?

292
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:18,519
Move, move, move!

293
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:19,440
Pick up the pace.

294
00:15:19,639 --> 00:15:20,480
Let me tell you all,

295
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,320
last five minutes.

296
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,159
Everyone evacuate in five minutes.

297
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:24,200
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

298
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,320
Why did headquarters suddenly give this order?

299
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,159
Come on!

300
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:28,600
Are we abandoning this liaison station?

301
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,399
No idea.

302
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,080
When previous commanders gave such orders,

303
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,600
it meant we were pulling back the front line.

304
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,360
Pulling back again.

305
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,960
Might as well just go back to Chongqing.

306
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,360
Who is this?

307
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,519
Is it you?

308
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:40,399
Why are you talking nonsense? You were just here

309
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:41,200
dragging your feet.

310
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,720
Are you waiting for the Japanese to show up or what?

311
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,519
Hurry up!

312
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,160
Mr. Gu, your sudden visit is unexpected.

313
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,519
I apologize for not welcoming you from afar.

314
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,319
Miss Jiang.

315
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,279
This is truly an impressive gesture.

316
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,000
And this gentleman—

317
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,519
Forgive me, I don't recognize you.

318
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,359
There's no need to have met before to meet now.

319
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:09,519
So you are the one I've heard of but never met—

320
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:10,799
An old acquaintance.

321
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:12,519
Gentlemen,

322
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,599
let's talk inside.

323
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,160
Report.

324
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:19,519
Come in.

325
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,000
Chief.

326
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,799
This is Mr. Takagi.

327
00:18:25,799 --> 00:18:28,440
Interrogation files sent from the intelligence headquarters.

328
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,880
There are seven suspects.

329
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:34,000
The peace conference will be held soon.

330
00:18:34,519 --> 00:18:35,559
At this critical moment,

331
00:18:35,559 --> 00:18:37,680
we're still struggling with the list of suspected infiltrators.

332
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,799
What else did Takagi say?

333
00:18:40,039 --> 00:18:41,079
Mr. Takagi

334
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:42,599
hopes to get some assistance from you.

335
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:45,559
He believes Miss Hirata Kiko

336
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:47,799
has planted a mole.

337
00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:49,359
That person will likely try to contact you.

338
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:54,200
We can't always rely on outside help.

339
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,839
We should try to solve it ourselves first.

340
00:18:57,279 --> 00:18:57,920
Chief.

341
00:18:58,319 --> 00:19:00,440
How should we respond?

342
00:19:03,319 --> 00:19:04,559
No need to reply.

343
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,880
Go tell Takagi Yuyi

344
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,519
that I will host a banquet.

345
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,160
Everyone at headquarters

346
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,279
will receive an invitation.

347
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,880
Those he suspects

348
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,200
should be investigated thoroughly.

349
00:19:14,599 --> 00:19:15,119
Yes, sir.

350
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,079
What about the time and place?

351
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:27,440
Please have some tea, sir.

352
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:28,680
Thank you.

353
00:19:36,039 --> 00:19:38,079
Miss Jiang knows my identity.

354
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,960
You are Mr. Gu's teacher.

355
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,279
You came from Chongqing.

356
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,920
Besides our own intelligence network,

357
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:53,799
one could say

358
00:19:54,279 --> 00:19:55,200
Miss Jiang

359
00:19:55,359 --> 00:19:55,799
is our

360
00:19:55,799 --> 00:19:57,839
most reliable intelligence branch.

361
00:19:58,279 --> 00:19:59,400
After working together for so long,

362
00:20:00,039 --> 00:20:01,640
please allow me, in person,

363
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:04,240
to express my gratitude to Miss Jiang.

364
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,440
You flatter me, sir.

365
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,920
In my opinion,

366
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:09,519
your visit here

367
00:20:10,119 --> 00:20:11,559
is probably not just

368
00:20:11,559 --> 00:20:13,119
to express your thanks.

369
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,200
I do have something

370
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,279
I wish to ask you about.

371
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:19,640
Please go ahead.

372
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,359
Miss Jiang, I wonder

373
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,400
recently

374
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,279
if you have any information on East Coast Trading Company.

375
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,880
East Coast Trading Company?

376
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,160
Yes.

377
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,559
Price is not an issue.

378
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,240
The active period of East Coast Trading Company

379
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:39,200
should have been thirteen years ago.

380
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,039
Given your age,

381
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:42,200
you might not know

382
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,880
what kind of organization it was.

383
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,119
But I hope

384
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,000
if recently

385
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,200
there is any information about East Coast Trading Company,

386
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,640
please be sure to inform me.

387
00:20:57,079 --> 00:21:00,119
I remember Senior Asai

388
00:21:00,319 --> 00:21:01,960
had a mansion by the Huangpu River.

389
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,920
It's best at night

390
00:21:04,279 --> 00:21:05,960
for enjoying the distant view from the balcony.

391
00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:07,759
Why not arrange it there?

392
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,039
Then, in a place he's familiar with,

393
00:21:10,119 --> 00:21:11,440
we can enjoy the big gift he brings.

394
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,759
Tomorrow night at seven o'clock sharp.

395
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,359
Send someone to make the arrangements.

396
00:21:14,519 --> 00:21:15,160
Yes.

397
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:15,920
Understood.

398
00:21:18,119 --> 00:21:19,079
Mr. Xie,

399
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,039
then I'll be direct.

400
00:21:24,319 --> 00:21:26,319
To get the most useful information,

401
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,400
I need to know more details.

402
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,119
The East Coast Trading Company you mentioned,

403
00:21:31,119 --> 00:21:32,480
what exactly is the situation with it?

404
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:34,640
At this point in time,

405
00:21:35,799 --> 00:21:37,319
is it related to the conference?

406
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:46,240
Miss Jiang,

407
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,000
how do you determine that?

408
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,039
Right now, besides the Peace Conference,

409
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:54,880
is there anything bigger

410
00:21:55,839 --> 00:21:57,400
from the Japanese-Wang side?

411
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,039
Miss Jiang,

412
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,119
there's no need to worry.

413
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,759
I'm only interested in the East Coast Trading Company.

414
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,480
You just need to keep helping me

415
00:22:09,799 --> 00:22:11,799
by gathering information on this matter.

416
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,400
Alright.

417
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,279
Rest assured, Mr. Xie.

418
00:22:16,279 --> 00:22:17,640
If I get any relevant information,

419
00:22:18,119 --> 00:22:19,599
I'll inform you immediately.

420
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,000
Okay.

421
00:22:28,279 --> 00:22:28,960
Teacher

422
00:22:29,559 --> 00:22:31,200
The Shanghai station just sent someone with a message.

423
00:22:31,359 --> 00:22:32,799
Station Chief Wang has something important to report.

424
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,319
It's about coordinating the operation.

425
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:35,960
Teacher

426
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,319
Should I go over there?

427
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,880
Our deployment will begin tomorrow night.

428
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,519
This matter is rather urgent.

429
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:44,559
Take care of this matter first.

430
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,079
Yes.

431
00:22:55,599 --> 00:22:56,720
Look into Jiang Feiman.

432
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,279
Find out who they've been in contact with these past few days.

433
00:22:58,759 --> 00:23:00,079
Give me a detailed report.

434
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,160
Yes.

435
00:23:12,519 --> 00:23:13,319
Miss Xie

436
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:16,680
You all

437
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,039
Miss Xie

438
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,279
It's your sister-in-law.

439
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:26,079
Sister

440
00:23:26,079 --> 00:23:27,920
Guess what I brought you.

441
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:29,559
I brought chestnut porridge.

442
00:23:29,559 --> 00:23:31,720
And chicken soup with yam and pork tripe.

443
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,880
It's really delicious.

444
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:34,759
There are also two vegetarian stir-fried dishes.

445
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,519
I thought I'd come visit Miss Xie.

446
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,759
But I was worried you wouldn't have time to host me.

447
00:23:39,759 --> 00:23:40,759
So I had Mrs. Li prepare everything.

448
00:23:40,759 --> 00:23:41,799
And rushed to bring it over.

449
00:23:41,799 --> 00:23:42,599
Thank you, sister-in-law.

450
00:23:42,599 --> 00:23:43,759
It's still warm.

451
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,880
Am I being a bit abrupt?

452
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,480
Sister-in-law, what are you saying?

453
00:23:49,599 --> 00:23:50,160
You came to see me,

454
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,480
I'm more than happy about it.

455
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,559
Otherwise, living here alone,

456
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,039
I wouldn't even have anyone to talk to.

457
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,519
If I didn't come to see you,

458
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,279
I wouldn't even know what kind of days you're having.

459
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,839
That Liang Shuo, honestly...

460
00:24:04,519 --> 00:24:06,759
Men are all so careless.

461
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,119
His own fiancée is living so frugally,

462
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:10,799
and he can just let it be.

463
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:13,039
Don't worry.

464
00:24:13,079 --> 00:24:14,279
I'll talk to him about it later.

465
00:24:14,279 --> 00:24:15,759
So he can bring you to live with him.

466
00:24:15,759 --> 00:24:16,519
No need.

467
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:17,599
He's too busy.

468
00:24:17,839 --> 00:24:19,680
So busy that I can't even see him.

469
00:24:20,039 --> 00:24:20,960
Besides,

470
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,319
we're not even married yet.

471
00:24:24,279 --> 00:24:25,839
We're not married yet.

472
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:30,079
Alright.

473
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,240
You all can go out now.

474
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,000
We women are talking.

475
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,359
Why are you listening so intently?

476
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:34,200
Yes.

477
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,200
Sister-in-law, let me pour that for you.

478
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,839
No, no, I can do it myself.

479
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,200
I really don't know either.

480
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,000
I didn't realize you were living like this.

481
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,799
We still have a property on Beidang Road.

482
00:24:49,799 --> 00:24:51,240
It's a bit small,

483
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,640
but if we tidy it up,

484
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,400
it'll definitely be more comfortable than here.

485
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:56,000
Oh, I couldn't possibly impose.

486
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,119
There's no need to be so polite.

487
00:24:59,279 --> 00:24:59,920
Sister-in-law,

488
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:02,200
things are getting more and more tense outside these days.

489
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,519
If you have two people with you,

490
00:25:03,519 --> 00:25:05,039
it really would be safer.

491
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,599
But having people follow you everywhere

492
00:25:06,599 --> 00:25:07,839
is so inconvenient.

493
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:09,680
But,

494
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,839
I heard that a couple of days ago, around here,

495
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:13,559
an anti-Japanese activist escaped.

496
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,200
And it was a woman, too.

497
00:25:16,279 --> 00:25:17,079
Really?

498
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,640
Did anything happen because of that?

499
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,799
Of course something happened.

500
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:22,599
I heard from Old Cui

501
00:25:22,599 --> 00:25:23,480
that two of our men died.

502
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,680
They still haven't caught her.

503
00:25:24,759 --> 00:25:25,799
Because of this,

504
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,680
he's absolutely furious.

505
00:25:30,599 --> 00:25:32,119
The world is really chaotic these days.

506
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,200
Exactly.

507
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:36,359
I said I wanted to come see you,

508
00:25:36,359 --> 00:25:37,119
but he insisted

509
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:39,359
on having two men accompany me.

510
00:25:39,359 --> 00:25:41,079
I always tell your brother

511
00:25:41,079 --> 00:25:42,480
not to bring his work habits

512
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,599
into the house.

513
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,079
But he just won't listen.

514
00:25:45,799 --> 00:25:46,640
Sister-in-law,

515
00:25:46,839 --> 00:25:48,200
you say you're not happy,

516
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,640
but inside, you must be overjoyed.

517
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:51,480
Big Brother Cui really cares about you.

518
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:53,160
I really envy you two.

519
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,200
Your relationship is so good.

520
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,599
It's not like that.

521
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,000
But still,

522
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,160
it's not bad.

523
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:08,960
Your sister-in-law has already visited Miss Xie.

524
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:10,119
There was nothing wrong.

525
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,400
These two brothers also checked privately.

526
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,680
There really wasn't anything unusual.

527
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,480
Director,

528
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:18,160
we really did wrongly accuse Miss Xie before.

529
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,960
Look at her, she's so young,

530
00:26:20,519 --> 00:26:22,160
she really doesn't seem like

531
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
an anti-Japanese activist.

532
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,359
She wouldn't label herself with those four words.

533
00:26:28,759 --> 00:26:29,559
Have you forgotten

534
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:30,880
the Communist we executed at Laohu Bridge?

535
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,319
That Communist

536
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:34,160
was only sixteen.

537
00:26:37,119 --> 00:26:37,799
Yes.

538
00:26:40,039 --> 00:26:40,720
Delun,

539
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,279
do you think Director Liang

540
00:26:45,079 --> 00:26:45,960
has any issues?

541
00:26:46,839 --> 00:26:48,519
I wouldn't dare say.

542
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:54,400
It's okay.

543
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,480
Go ahead, say it.

544
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,519
Then I'll speak frankly.

545
00:26:58,759 --> 00:27:00,200
About these recent events,

546
00:27:00,359 --> 00:27:01,559
they are indeed, to some extent,

547
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:03,279
connected to Director Liang.

548
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,799
But that's not really surprising.

549
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,680
After all, someone like Director Liang

550
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,359
with such a bold and straightforward personality

551
00:27:10,359 --> 00:27:11,759
is bound to offend quite a few people.

552
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,759
But what I find strange

553
00:27:14,039 --> 00:27:15,799
is the relationship between Director Liang and you,

554
00:27:17,319 --> 00:27:18,519
and with me.

555
00:27:19,519 --> 00:27:21,680
Ever since Director Liang returned to Shanghai,

556
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,039
he's become much more distant from you.

557
00:27:23,359 --> 00:27:24,599
From our perspective,

558
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,559
the old Director Liang

559
00:27:25,559 --> 00:27:27,640
used to come to you for everything.

560
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,599
So that's what you all think.

561
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,160
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

562
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:41,079
Given your relationship with Director Liang,

563
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,599
how would we dare to gossip?

564
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:47,839
The chief said

565
00:27:48,119 --> 00:27:49,240
we should investigate through the murder weapon

566
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,440
to look for clues.

567
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,400
Is there any news from Xiu Quan?

568
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,359
The verification results are out.

569
00:27:54,519 --> 00:27:55,839
The wound is too narrow.

570
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,519
It should be something like a nail.

571
00:27:57,759 --> 00:27:58,519
But,

572
00:27:58,519 --> 00:27:59,920
the wound is flat.

573
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,920
It's a bit different from a nail.

574
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,200
Meihua Hall has sent a notice.

575
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:08,039
There's a banquet tonight at the Qianjing Residence.

576
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,920
There will be an extra layer of security checks.

577
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:10,920
This time,

578
00:28:11,079 --> 00:28:12,880
the search will be conducted by the Japanese.

579
00:28:13,079 --> 00:28:14,039
Tell the brothers

580
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,400
to keep a close watch.

581
00:28:16,599 --> 00:28:17,519
I want to see

582
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,039
who would carry such a sharp object.

583
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:20,759
Yes.

584
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:29,440
Come in.

585
00:28:31,359 --> 00:28:31,839
Boss,

586
00:28:32,039 --> 00:28:32,839
Director Lu is here.

587
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:33,359
He says

588
00:28:33,359 --> 00:28:34,319
he has something to report.

589
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:36,400
Report.

590
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,960
Director Lu really knows how to joke.

591
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,160
Invite him in quickly.

592
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,200
Director Lu, please.

593
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:51,599
Did you find anything?

594
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,440
I checked everyone around.

595
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,319
I didn't find anything suspicious.

596
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,200
Could we be looking in the wrong direction?

597
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,279
Bone maggot.

598
00:29:03,599 --> 00:29:04,079
Maybe it's possible.

599
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:05,480
It could approach you without a sound.

600
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,680
But if he wants to leave the agent headquarters,

601
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,799
he'll always leave some traces.

602
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:18,720
Old Hu, it's shift change.

603
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:19,160
Yeah.

604
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,119
I just finished the night shift.

605
00:29:20,119 --> 00:29:20,960
I haven't eaten yet.

606
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:21,720
Have you guys eaten?

607
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:22,759
We have, we have.

608
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:23,599
Take care.

609
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,480
Liang Si.

610
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:25,559
Liang Si.

611
00:29:46,039 --> 00:29:46,839
Come here for a moment.

612
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:51,680
Director Liang.

613
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:52,960
Is there something you need from me?

614
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:54,279
Nothing else.

615
00:29:54,599 --> 00:29:56,880
I just want you to look into something.

616
00:29:57,359 --> 00:29:58,599
What is it about?

617
00:30:00,319 --> 00:30:01,519
The recent incidents.

618
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,599
You know about them too.

619
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,839
Director Hirata was killed.

620
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,240
The raid on anti-Japanese elements at Xiaodongmen failed.

621
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:08,240
The higher-ups

622
00:30:08,359 --> 00:30:08,960
have instructed me

623
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,920
to investigate these matters discreetly.

624
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,799
Isn't this something you could have just called about?

625
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,079
You even came here in person.

626
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:15,519
This...

627
00:30:15,519 --> 00:30:17,440
I'm a bit flattered by the attention.

628
00:30:18,519 --> 00:30:19,640
What do you know?

629
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,079
If I questioned everyone one by one in my office,

630
00:30:23,319 --> 00:30:24,519
would that still be called a discreet investigation?

631
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,440
Yes, yes, of course.

632
00:30:25,759 --> 00:30:26,759
I see.

633
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,680
Let me ask you,

634
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,640
in this recent period,

635
00:30:31,119 --> 00:30:32,359
at our main entrance,

636
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,240
has anyone suspicious shown up?

637
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,839
Suspicious people?

638
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,599
Other than that,

639
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,480
have you noticed anything else?

640
00:31:00,759 --> 00:31:01,599
For example,

641
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,240
have the people around us

642
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:06,160
started acting differently than before?

643
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,559
Anyone else?

644
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:10,000
Well,

645
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,039
there's Deputy Director Zhou from the General Affairs Office.

646
00:31:12,319 --> 00:31:12,799
Lately,

647
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,200
he's been coming and going quite often.

648
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,079
But,

649
00:31:15,319 --> 00:31:17,599
it's all within the scope of his regular work.

650
00:31:18,519 --> 00:31:19,400
You know,

651
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,680
his family has some connections with the Japanese.

652
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,119
So,

653
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,680
no one really pays attention to him.

654
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,519
Zhou Andao from the General Affairs Office?

655
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,279
Yes, that's right.

656
00:31:26,279 --> 00:31:27,119
That's him.

657
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:31,680
Is there anything else?

658
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:32,440
Go on.

659
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,640
Anything else?

660
00:31:34,039 --> 00:31:35,599
There's nothing different.

661
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:39,440
Understood.

662
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,759
There have been frequent accidents lately.

663
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,279
Some things can't be talked about too much.

664
00:31:44,519 --> 00:31:45,799
I can only hint at it.

665
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,839
Before the investigation has results,

666
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,559
keep your mouth shut.

667
00:31:50,359 --> 00:31:51,759
Since I came to you,

668
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:52,960
you should understand

669
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,920
who I trust.

670
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,359
Understood, understood.

671
00:31:57,559 --> 00:31:58,559
If anything comes up in the future,

672
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,799
keep an eye out for me.

673
00:31:59,799 --> 00:32:00,319
Yes, yes.

674
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:00,839
You won't be treated unfairly.

675
00:32:00,839 --> 00:32:01,480
Th-this...

676
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,519
I can't accept this.

677
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:06,920
Stop talking nonsense.

678
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:07,799
Take it.

679
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,920
Buy something for your wife and kids.

680
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,279
Don't worry.

681
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,759
My mouth

682
00:32:13,759 --> 00:32:14,759
is like an iron gate.

683
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:15,519
I guarantee it.

684
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:17,200
Not a single word will get out.

685
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,279
If I find anything,

686
00:32:18,279 --> 00:32:20,039
I'll report to you immediately.

687
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:21,480
Go.

688
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:24,880
Hello, Director Liang.

689
00:32:43,079 --> 00:32:44,119
This Zhou Andao

690
00:32:44,359 --> 00:32:46,319
We hadn't really paid much attention to him before.

691
00:32:47,359 --> 00:32:48,799
We need to find a way to investigate.

692
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:51,079
Are there any other discoveries?

693
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:56,160
Torn off from the entry and exit list.

694
00:32:59,799 --> 00:33:00,880
On the day of the incident.

695
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:02,599
The times before and after we returned.

696
00:33:02,599 --> 00:33:04,279
Everyone who returned to headquarters is a suspect.

697
00:33:04,599 --> 00:33:05,799
Including this Zhou Andao.

698
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,000
No fewer than five people.

699
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:08,440
Is there any other way to eliminate suspects?

700
00:33:09,559 --> 00:33:11,200
This is the final result after elimination.

701
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,400
Other than that,

702
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,440
we can only eliminate them one by one.

703
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,160
Remember,

704
00:33:15,359 --> 00:33:16,440
a real agent

705
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:17,599
when facing the enemy

706
00:33:17,839 --> 00:33:19,079
will fight back directly.

707
00:33:19,359 --> 00:33:20,839
We must investigate thoroughly.

708
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:24,279
Director.

709
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,519
Director.

710
00:33:27,119 --> 00:33:27,920
Director.

711
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,480
I'm here.

712
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:34,720
Director

713
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,119
Urgent notice from Meihua Hall

714
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:39,720
Chief Mizuno

715
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:42,440
There will be a dinner party tonight at a lakeside villa.

716
00:33:42,759 --> 00:33:43,119
Yes.

717
00:33:43,119 --> 00:33:44,279
Wasn't he on a business trip?

718
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,720
I heard he came back early.

719
00:33:45,839 --> 00:33:47,079
They said he's here to arrange something.

720
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,720
Preparations for the Peace Conference.

721
00:33:50,039 --> 00:33:51,359
A dinner party of this level

722
00:33:51,799 --> 00:33:53,119
shouldn't it be the Executive Committee

723
00:33:53,119 --> 00:33:54,640
that informs the Special Operations Headquarters?

724
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:57,160
Why is Meihua Hall delivering the message directly?

725
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,640
Boss, I don't know either.

726
00:33:58,839 --> 00:34:00,319
Also, headquarters sent a lot of military police.

727
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,240
The main gate has been sealed.

728
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,319
No one is allowed in or out.

729
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,119
Boss.

730
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:05,799
What do these Japanese mean by this?

731
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,240
Are they putting us under house arrest?

732
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:08,559
Don't jump to conclusions.

733
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:09,840
Get back to work.

734
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:11,079
Yes.

735
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,440
You've already heard.

736
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,559
Mizuno Shingen is trying to prevent any information from leaking.

737
00:34:22,559 --> 00:34:23,440
That's why things are like this.

738
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:25,800
It seems he has a major plan in place.

739
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,920
The plan against Bone Maggot is about to change.

740
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,360
Bone Maggot's contact target is Mizuno Shingen.

741
00:34:33,079 --> 00:34:35,320
As long as Mizuno Shingen is still in this mansion,

742
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,079
Bone Maggot

743
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,039
won't be able

744
00:34:37,039 --> 00:34:38,519
to bypass us, the attendees,

745
00:34:38,519 --> 00:34:39,679
and contact him directly.

746
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,519
If we just wait for him to show up,

747
00:34:42,519 --> 00:34:43,760
maybe that's a good thing.

748
00:34:44,519 --> 00:34:45,599
If you put it that way,

749
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,000
I'm even more worried now.

750
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:48,840
Why?

751
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,159
Think about it.

752
00:34:50,599 --> 00:34:53,039
Mizuno arranged a dinner at this particular time.

753
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,840
What exactly is he planning?

754
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:06,119
Tonight is our last chance to eliminate Bone Maggot.

755
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,119
Then let's find him.

756
00:35:09,519 --> 00:35:10,840
Deputy Director of General Affairs,

757
00:35:11,199 --> 00:35:11,920
Zhou Andao,

758
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:14,000
returned to headquarters at 11:10 that day.

759
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,400
The reason for going out was material allocation.

760
00:35:16,519 --> 00:35:18,239
But the supplies for the Special Agent Headquarters

761
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,039
have always been allocated directly by Meihua Hall.

762
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,480
This Zhou Andao is the most suspicious.

763
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,480
Leave this person to me.

764
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:34,000
The situation is getting more and more complicated.

765
00:35:34,159 --> 00:35:35,760
We can't get any information anywhere.

766
00:35:36,039 --> 00:35:36,920
Could it be that the list

767
00:35:37,159 --> 00:35:39,119
has already fallen into the hands of Meihua Hall?

768
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:41,360
We must report to our superiors immediately.

769
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,119
Don't rush.

770
00:35:42,639 --> 00:35:44,000
It's not that simple.

771
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,159
Since there's no news,

772
00:35:46,159 --> 00:35:47,320
it means Asai Shou

773
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,760
hasn't arrived in Shanghai yet.

774
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,079
What do you mean?

775
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,719
That's the intriguing part.

776
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:55,840
Such an important list—

777
00:35:56,599 --> 00:35:58,480
it's the result of Asai Shou's life's work.

778
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:01,639
How could he hand it over so easily?

779
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,320
You mean

780
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:05,159
he will personally escort the list?

781
00:36:05,199 --> 00:36:06,199
We still have a chance.

782
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,960
Rather than calling it a chance,

783
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:09,960
it's more like a gamble.

784
00:36:10,719 --> 00:36:13,360
If the Communists get a lead, it'll be a disaster.

785
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,960
We must get the list before they do.

786
00:36:17,519 --> 00:36:18,800
Wang Mutian from the Shanghai station

787
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,239
has already responded to my request.

788
00:36:20,639 --> 00:36:21,679
Starting today,

789
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:23,360
he is expected to take full control of the Shanghai station.

790
00:36:23,719 --> 00:36:24,599
So tonight,

791
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:26,000
the meeting at St. John's Church on Xiao Qiao Road

792
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,559
I must attend.

793
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:28,719
Also,

794
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:31,079
everyone involved in today's operation

795
00:36:31,159 --> 00:36:33,679
must be coordinated and assigned over there.

796
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,599
In this situation,

797
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,400
I'm still a bit worried.

798
00:36:37,679 --> 00:36:38,840
Worrying won't help.

799
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,800
We have to look ahead.

800
00:36:42,679 --> 00:36:43,920
At least that Wang Mutian

801
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,039
has finally come to his senses.

802
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,760
You threaten him every day

803
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:49,159
saying you'll report him to Director Dai.

804
00:36:49,519 --> 00:36:50,199
It seems

805
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,840
it's not completely useless.

806
00:36:52,679 --> 00:36:53,719
I'll go with you tonight.

807
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:54,440
No.

808
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,360
You have other plans.

809
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,880
I suspect our intelligence

810
00:36:59,039 --> 00:37:00,360
has some issues.

811
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,159
We must handle it immediately.

812
00:37:02,599 --> 00:37:03,719
Otherwise,

813
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,280
we might end up

814
00:37:05,559 --> 00:37:07,199
doing all the work for the Communists.

815
00:37:07,679 --> 00:37:08,679
I didn't expect

816
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,320
Xie Jun'an's vigilance

817
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,639
to be so strong.

818
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,960
He almost immediately realized

819
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,320
I was trying to get information from him.

820
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,400
Here, have some water.

821
00:37:16,559 --> 00:37:17,280
Thank you.

822
00:37:18,639 --> 00:37:20,280
At least now I know

823
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,599
Xie Jun'an

824
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:24,039
values this intelligence extremely highly.

825
00:37:24,559 --> 00:37:25,559
So our probing

826
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,159
was not without value.

827
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:28,719
I suspect

828
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:29,679
this

829
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:30,960
information related to the Peace Conference

830
00:37:31,039 --> 00:37:32,440
is likely

831
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,079
very likely

832
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,440
to involve the upper echelons of the Nationalist Party

833
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:37,480
and some

834
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,239
political matters.

835
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:41,519
Is it really that serious?

836
00:37:41,679 --> 00:37:42,679
Xie Jun'an

837
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:43,920
is so nervous about it.

838
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:45,719
That's very unusual.

839
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,199
I can only guess in this direction.

840
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,239
I've been trying

841
00:37:50,239 --> 00:37:51,880
to find out about this intelligence.

842
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,599
But Xie Jun'an is very tight-lipped.

843
00:37:54,119 --> 00:37:55,039
Whenever I mention the conference,

844
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:56,360
he immediately stops talking.

845
00:37:59,559 --> 00:38:00,679
This isn't your fault.

846
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,519
What we need now is an opportunity.

847
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,239
I have a feeling

848
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:07,000
that the scale of this intelligence

849
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:08,440
is unprecedented.

850
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,480
Right now,

851
00:38:10,719 --> 00:38:12,320
you must protect yourself.

852
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:13,920
If you are certain

853
00:38:14,039 --> 00:38:15,119
that they suspect you,

854
00:38:15,559 --> 00:38:16,440
if necessary,

855
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:17,840
abandon the base.

856
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:24,239
Everything is almost set up here.

857
00:38:24,239 --> 00:38:25,400
Do you think it's alright?

858
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,320
Who would have thought

859
00:38:29,159 --> 00:38:31,719
that this small mansion used to be

860
00:38:32,159 --> 00:38:33,920
the headquarters of an intelligence agency with over a thousand people.

861
00:38:34,599 --> 00:38:35,159
Chief

862
00:38:35,159 --> 00:38:38,199
Are you interested in putting new wine in old bottles?

863
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:39,960
Takagi

864
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:42,559
I didn't call you here for small talk.

865
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,119
My apologies.

866
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,320
Regarding tonight's operation,

867
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:49,519
we still need a detailed plan.

868
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,960
As for the search for the mole in the agent headquarters,

869
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,880
I already have a preliminary assessment.

870
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,760
No, that's not what I'm talking about.

871
00:38:57,039 --> 00:38:58,840
I have a new task for you.

872
00:39:00,039 --> 00:39:00,679
Understood.

873
00:39:10,119 --> 00:39:12,719
Stay alert and be vigilant.

874
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,360
For this operation,

875
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,559
make sure to stay safe.

876
00:39:16,559 --> 00:39:17,199
Yes, of course.

877
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,000
Teacher.

878
00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:19,079
According to Pingchuan Academy

879
00:39:19,079 --> 00:39:20,679
and reports from nearby contacts,

880
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:23,039
Jiang Feiman has been going out very frequently lately.

881
00:39:23,039 --> 00:39:24,000
It's highly unusual.

882
00:39:24,559 --> 00:39:26,039
And right after you left,

883
00:39:26,039 --> 00:39:27,599
she left in a hurry.

884
00:39:28,519 --> 00:39:30,119
But we lost track of her.

885
00:39:33,159 --> 00:39:34,159
Understood.

886
00:39:40,159 --> 00:39:40,800
Teacher.

887
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:41,920
Everything has been arranged.

888
00:39:42,159 --> 00:39:44,119
Now we're just waiting for news from the Shanghai station.

889
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:45,559
Very good.

890
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:48,599
Yes.

891
00:39:49,199 --> 00:39:50,360
To be on the safe side,

892
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,800
should we contact Jiang Feiman

893
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,360
and have her check the surroundings?

894
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,519
Let's put that aside for now.

895
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,000
Come with me for a moment.

896
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,639
Teacher

897
00:40:12,199 --> 00:40:14,760
How does the teacher usually treat you all?

898
00:40:16,159 --> 00:40:18,320
The teacher has always been honest with us.

899
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:19,880
Honest

900
00:40:20,559 --> 00:40:21,800
Now, someone

901
00:40:22,239 --> 00:40:23,239
towards me

902
00:40:23,519 --> 00:40:24,679
is not being honest.

903
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,480
I don't understand what you mean, Teacher.

904
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,480
I originally thought

905
00:40:30,119 --> 00:40:33,119
it was just some private contact with the Communist Party.

906
00:40:33,679 --> 00:40:35,280
But now it seems

907
00:40:36,599 --> 00:40:37,559
it's definitely not

908
00:40:37,719 --> 00:40:39,159
as simple as just contact.

909
00:40:40,599 --> 00:40:42,880
Even if you suspect something, Teacher, you should have some evidence.

910
00:40:43,679 --> 00:40:45,480
I have always followed you, Teacher.

911
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:46,760
I have never

912
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:48,400
I'm talking about Jiang Feiman.

913
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:54,119
She is definitely not an information broker.

914
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:55,119
It's not that simple.

915
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:56,519
Yes.

916
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:57,760
I mean,

917
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,840
I've always followed you closely.

918
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:02,320
I've never noticed anything unusual about her.

919
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:03,639
Teacher,

920
00:41:04,039 --> 00:41:05,480
why do you think she

921
00:41:05,519 --> 00:41:07,320
has any connection to the Communists?

922
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,840
Why are you nervous?

923
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,239
I'm not.

924
00:41:11,679 --> 00:41:13,079
I'm just curious.

925
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:15,880
After all, Jiang Feiman's intelligence network in Shanghai

926
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,719
is inevitably linked to the Communists.

927
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:19,280
It's unavoidable.

928
00:41:20,039 --> 00:41:20,880
You know that too.

929
00:41:21,039 --> 00:41:22,400
These people are everywhere.

930
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,480
Could there be some misunderstanding?

931
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,119
A misunderstanding?

932
00:41:28,639 --> 00:41:30,360
Maybe it is a misunderstanding.

933
00:41:31,079 --> 00:41:32,639
But I still can't

934
00:41:33,159 --> 00:41:34,719
help but suspect her.

935
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,679
As an information broker,

936
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,400
her behavior yesterday

937
00:41:40,519 --> 00:41:41,800
was different from usual.

938
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,920
Is that the only reason, Teacher?

939
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:47,639
Just because of that?

940
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:50,000
Don't forget,

941
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:51,679
among our enemies,

942
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:52,880
besides the Japanese,

943
00:41:53,679 --> 00:41:54,880
only the Communists

944
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,920
have fought a long battle with us.

945
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:00,280
