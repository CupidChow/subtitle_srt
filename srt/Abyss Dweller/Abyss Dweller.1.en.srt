1
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,520
Where is the thing?

2
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,919
I don't want this either.

3
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:09,360
But I have no choice.

4
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:11,120
Who sent you?

5
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:12,639
Told me to do whatever it takes.

6
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:13,680
What are you doing?

7
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,039
You must understand what the mission is.

8
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:17,120
Complete it.

9
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:18,199
Do everything you can.

10
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:20,159
Even if it costs your life.

11
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,439
What thing?

12
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:28,719
What mission?

13
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,560
Where am I?

14
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,960
And who are they?

15
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:37,080
Why can't I remember anything?

16
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:07,240
Mom!

17
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,120
What is it?

18
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,319
Why are you holding it so tightly?

19
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:10,599
So tightly?

20
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:11,879
Brother.

21
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:12,840
Don't force it.

22
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:16,120
So tight.

23
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:27,879
Ping'er

24
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:29,240
He's awake.

25
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,079
Awake.

26
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:35,439
Put the gun down.

27
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:39,879
Brother,

28
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:40,839
don't be nervous.

29
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,000
We were the ones who saved you.

30
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,279
We're not bad people.

31
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,759
We're hunters.

32
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,120
There's still shrapnel in your head that hasn't been removed.

33
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,000
Let go of my brother.

34
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,439
He's not going to make it.

35
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,920
Brother! Brother!

36
00:04:58,639 --> 00:04:59,240
Brother!

37
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,199
Are you okay?

38
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:01,439
You're this badly hurt,

39
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,959
how are you still so strong?

40
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,319
Who are you, really?

41
00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:07,480
Who are you people?

42
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:09,720
This is Yulong Mountain.

43
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,800
The snow is too heavy right now.

44
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,800
We can't take you down to see a doctor.

45
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,560
We can only do some simple bandaging for you.

46
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,879
You're really lucky to be alive.

47
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,920
You've been unconscious here for three days and nights.

48
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:19,120
Who are you, really?

49
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,160
What's your name?

50
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:24,480
My name?

51
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:29,720
My name?

52
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,959
My name?

53
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:36,000
I...

54
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:47,600
Not good.

55
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,279
There are Japanese soldiers.

56
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,199
Japanese soldiers.

57
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:51,639
They're coming.

58
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,120
Take it.

59
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,120
How many people?

60
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:54,319
A squad.

61
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:54,959
Let's fight.

62
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:55,399
Okay.

63
00:05:58,319 --> 00:05:59,199
Surround this place.

64
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,560
Oh no.

65
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,199
Don't go out.

66
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:03,759
They said they're going to surround this place.

67
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,040
Who are you?

68
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,160
How do you know Japanese?

69
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:07,279
Are you a traitor?

70
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,720
Mosin-Nagant.

71
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:14,040
This isn't a gun ordinary people can have.

72
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:15,519
The gun has wear marks.

73
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:16,560
And a sling.

74
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:18,399
You can't fool an expert.

75
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,759
You two siblings have different accents.

76
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:22,360
So you're not real siblings.

77
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,439
And your gun handling shows professional training.

78
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,839
You’re probably not ordinary hunters.

79
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:28,879
Speak.

80
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:30,240
Who exactly are you?

81
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,839
Trust me.

82
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,720
I mean no harm.

83
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:48,600
There are Japanese soldiers everywhere outside.

84
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:50,480
If you want to survive,

85
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,839
do as I say.

86
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,360
Search the whole house.

87
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,240
Yes, yes.

88
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,319
The culprit might be inside.

89
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:01,279
Search that guy carefully.

90
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:02,160
Yes.

91
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,240
Be careful.

92
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,879
Go in!

93
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:46,639
Yes.

94
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,120
Bro.

95
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,680
You're hurt.

96
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:04,879
I'm fine.

97
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,759
You bastard.

98
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,799
Who exactly are you looking for?

99
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:05,799
We're looking for you.

100
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:10,639
I'm going to kill you.

101
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:46,399
Come.

102
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:47,080
Bro.

103
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,320
Careful.

104
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,000
Penetrating wound.

105
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:58,960
The collarbone is broken.

106
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:00,039
Give me a hand.

107
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:00,960
Put him on the bed.

108
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:01,639
Okay.

109
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:02,480
Come on.

110
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:44,399
Teacher,

111
00:10:46,039 --> 00:10:46,799
It's been two days.

112
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,879
We haven't been able to reach the brothers.

113
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,320
Something might have really happened.

114
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,639
The intelligence must be accurate.

115
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,399
I don't want possibilities.

116
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:56,240
The Japanese military police have sealed off Yulong Mountain.

117
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,480
Our people can't get close at all.

118
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,200
If something goes wrong this time,

119
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,240
we...

120
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,559
It hasn't come to that yet.

121
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:06,919
I know that in my heart.

122
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,559
Teacher,

123
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:09,120
Enough.

124
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:12,039
Now, Yan Jiu's capture and death

125
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:13,080
are already facts.

126
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:14,679
The most important thing

127
00:11:15,159 --> 00:11:16,679
is the whereabouts of that batch of explosives.

128
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,440
If the Japanese get hold of them,

129
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:20,799
our operation

130
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:22,159
will be completely ruined.

131
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,799
Notify Shusheng

132
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,200
to be on standby at all times.

133
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:26,000
Yes.

134
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:32,000
Take a look.

135
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,080
It's all written clearly here.

136
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,159
Isn't it just this?

137
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:36,960
Ma'am, we have rules.

138
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,039
Come on.

139
00:11:42,039 --> 00:11:42,799
Take them away.

140
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:43,440
Officer.

141
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:43,960
This really is mine.

142
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:44,360
Go buy a ticket.

143
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:44,799
Officer.

144
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,240
Please let me explain.

145
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:45,639
Move.

146
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,360
Officer.

147
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,600
Sir Takahashi.

148
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,679
Have a safe journey.

149
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:50,799
Next.

150
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:53,240
Don't push, okay?

151
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:54,559
Next.

152
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,360
Sorry, sorry.

153
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,639
What are you doing?

154
00:11:58,759 --> 00:11:59,720
Sorry, sorry.

155
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:06,759
Let go.

156
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:07,440
Excuse me.

157
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:07,919
Please make way.

158
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:09,720
Sorry.

159
00:12:10,279 --> 00:12:10,840
Sorry.

160
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,120
Bastard, move aside!

161
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,080
What?

162
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,600
In the Northeast, people don't stare at others.

163
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,320
What a hellhole.

164
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:19,840
This is unbearable.

165
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,159
You are...

166
00:12:21,159 --> 00:12:22,480
You're Japanese, right?

167
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:24,000
You...

168
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,679
You can speak Japanese.

169
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,919
I used to be a military interpreter.

170
00:12:29,559 --> 00:12:30,919
There are pickpockets everywhere here.

171
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:32,559
Please be very careful.

172
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,279
Oh no.

173
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,159
My documents are gone.

174
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,399
That person just now...

175
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,480
Hey!

176
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:47,279
Bastard!

177
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:48,159
Stop!

178
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,559
S-Sorry.

179
00:12:50,679 --> 00:12:52,200
Could you please watch my luggage?

180
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,120
Okay.

181
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,240
Alright.

182
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,080
Please, please!

183
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:55,720
You!

184
00:12:55,919 --> 00:12:56,799
Bastard!

185
00:12:57,039 --> 00:12:58,080
Stop right there!

186
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:06,440
Where are our seats?

187
00:13:15,799 --> 00:13:17,799
Sunflower seeds, peanuts, canned food

188
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,440
Ten yuan

189
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:20,399
Give me one

190
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,440
Come on, come on

191
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:22,879
Ticket

192
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,159
It was stolen

193
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,480
It really was stolen

194
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,279
Without a ticket, you can't board, sir

195
00:13:27,559 --> 00:13:29,399
Who exactly are you looking for?

196
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,399
We're looking for you

197
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,080
Why are the Japanese looking for me?

198
00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:36,960
And why am I in this mountain?

199
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,960
What exactly am I supposed to do?

200
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,039
I'm sorry

201
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,519
I've dragged you into this

202
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,639
I feel like the Japanese will come again

203
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:47,120
So no matter who you are

204
00:13:47,559 --> 00:13:49,559
Please, you must leave and take shelter

205
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:51,080
Don't worry about us

206
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,799
A blizzard is coming soon

207
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:53,960
When the heavy snow blocks the mountain

208
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,279
You won't be able to leave

209
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,000
Brother

210
00:13:57,919 --> 00:13:59,679
What do you actually do?

211
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:03,039
My name is Zhang Junping

212
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:05,919
I'm Wang Jiubao

213
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,600
If it's convenient

214
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,879
Leave your name

215
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,399
So we can meet again in the future

216
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:15,039
My name is

217
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,240
Right now, I

218
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,440
Really can't remember anything

219
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,360
Who am I, really?

220
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,080
This puzzle, you say

221
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:41,799
What does it really mean?

222
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,080
Shanghai

223
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,080
Maybe when I get to Shanghai

224
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:10,360
I'll be able to find out who I am

225
00:15:10,759 --> 00:15:13,559
And why I appeared on Yulong Mountain

226
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:16,919
All the answers are there

227
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,480
Be careful.

228
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:29,159
Don't run around.

229
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,200
Mom, I want some too.

230
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:43,559
Mom.

231
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,840
I'm hungry.

232
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,600
Hang in there a little longer.

233
00:15:52,679 --> 00:15:54,919
Search for that female spy.

234
00:15:54,919 --> 00:15:55,639
Yes.

235
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:57,840
I'm not cold either.

236
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,039
Show your ID.

237
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:01,559
You.

238
00:16:02,039 --> 00:16:02,919
Take out your ID.

239
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,000
Alright.

240
00:16:07,159 --> 00:16:08,039
Come on, make way.

241
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:08,519
Make way.

242
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:09,399
ID.

243
00:16:10,759 --> 00:16:11,720
Show your ID.

244
00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:20,720
Sunflower seeds, peanuts.

245
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:22,440
I'll search this side.

246
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:23,480
I'll search over there.

247
00:16:23,879 --> 00:16:24,720
That female spy.

248
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,120
She might have gotten on the train.

249
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:27,919
Understood.

250
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:28,720
Make way.

251
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:31,720
Sunflower seeds, peanuts.

252
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,799
Canned food.

253
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,240
Does anyone want some?

254
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:37,600
Sunflower seeds.

255
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,720
Peanuts.

256
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:41,559
Sunflower seeds.

257
00:16:41,559 --> 00:16:42,360
Peanuts.

258
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,440
Canned food.

259
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:47,639
Sunflower seeds.

260
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:48,440
Peanuts.

261
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,039
Canned food.

262
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:50,600
Does anyone want some?

263
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,279
Identification.

264
00:16:58,559 --> 00:16:59,399
Identification.

265
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:00,360
Show your identification.

266
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,120
Wait a moment.

267
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:02,960
This is mine.

268
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,000
Mine.

269
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,200
Yours.

270
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:08,920
Identification.

271
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:10,720
Where are you going?

272
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,160
I'm going back to my hometown.

273
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,559
What's your relationship?

274
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:14,720
We're married.

275
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:17,799
Yours.

276
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,160
Identification.

277
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:22,279
Identification.

278
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,720
Wait a moment.

279
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:26,039
What are you checking?

280
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,799
Have a safe journey.

281
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,680
Sorry, sorry.

282
00:17:52,599 --> 00:17:54,160
You can speak Japanese?

283
00:17:57,359 --> 00:18:00,640
There are only women and children here.

284
00:18:00,759 --> 00:18:02,640
Don't act too conspicuously.

285
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,480
If you search in the back,

286
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,720
you might find something.

287
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,279
This is...

288
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,480
My girlfriend.

289
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,400
That was very rude.

290
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:19,640
Hurry up and go.

291
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,319
Yes, sir.

292
00:18:28,839 --> 00:18:30,039
Are you Japanese?

293
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:32,000
Come with me.

294
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,079
Take a quick look.

295
00:18:37,079 --> 00:18:37,759
Look again.

296
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,519
Is it about this matter?

297
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,640
This place is close to the exit.

298
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,000
Get off here in a moment.

299
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:57,759
Once you're out of the station,

300
00:18:57,759 --> 00:18:58,559
you'll be safe.

301
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,359
Is this how you repay me?

302
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,039
Who are you, really?

303
00:19:11,839 --> 00:19:12,880
Can I say

304
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,680
that I don't even know myself?

305
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,480
You say you're not Japanese,

306
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,480
but your Japanese is so good.

307
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,519
I can't explain that to you either.

308
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,680
Then why did you help me?

309
00:19:27,839 --> 00:19:28,640
All I know is

310
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:30,319
if you had made a move just now,

311
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,119
everyone in the carriage would have been doomed.

312
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,920
I just didn't want to suffer for someone else's mistake.

313
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,000
The passengers who just boarded are starting ticket inspection.

314
00:19:40,119 --> 00:19:41,240
Please take out your tickets

315
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,200
and show them to me.

316
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:47,920
Don't follow me.

317
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,160
Stop.

318
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:22,759
Still not confessing?

319
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,279
I've already told you.

320
00:20:27,799 --> 00:20:28,799
We...

321
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,880
don't know anything.

322
00:20:40,759 --> 00:20:41,759
Sir,

323
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:43,720
at the corner of the yard,

324
00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:46,079
we dug up ten bodies from the seventh squad.

325
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,759
The scene has been thoroughly examined.

326
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:49,279
There really are no other traces.

327
00:20:50,119 --> 00:20:51,960
You two

328
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:54,960
killed an entire squad of mine.

329
00:20:58,119 --> 00:20:59,119
Impressive, huh?

330
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,279
Aren't you impressive?

331
00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:02,680
Those people

332
00:21:04,839 --> 00:21:06,720
were all killed by the two of us.

333
00:21:09,079 --> 00:21:12,359
Take the flesh from their bodies

334
00:21:12,359 --> 00:21:14,200
and slice it off piece by piece.

335
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,880
Hang it at the entrance of the village.

336
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,400
I want everyone to know

337
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,559
what happens to those who resist the Japanese military police.

338
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:33,359
Go!

339
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,039
The culprit must have been here.

340
00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:40,920
Seal off the train station immediately.

341
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:43,200
Then notify Chief Hirata.

342
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,039
Yes, sir.

343
00:22:04,839 --> 00:22:05,720
Come in.

344
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:09,960
Chief.

345
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:10,960
We found something.

346
00:22:16,839 --> 00:22:19,279
There is a Japanese passenger named Takahashi Kazusuke.

347
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:22,200
His documents and ticket were stolen at Harbin Station.

348
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,839
Fengtian, Beiping.

349
00:22:24,839 --> 00:22:29,160
Similar reports were also received in Fengtian and Beiping.

350
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:31,000
At Beiping Station,

351
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,319
the destination on the stolen ticket was

352
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:34,519
Nanjing.

353
00:22:35,519 --> 00:22:37,319
From Harbin to Fengtian, then to Beiping,

354
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,519
and then to Nanjing.

355
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,119
This person has been heading south all along.

356
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,119
He must be involved in the Yulongshan incident.

357
00:22:44,119 --> 00:22:45,079
He can't be unrelated.

358
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,400
It seems

359
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,880
this person's final destination is Shanghai.

360
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,359
Go check

361
00:22:53,359 --> 00:22:57,079
the train schedule from Nanjing to Shanghai immediately.

362
00:22:57,319 --> 00:22:58,839
Issue the order at once.

363
00:22:58,839 --> 00:23:00,440
If any suspicious person is found,

364
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,519
arrest them immediately.

365
00:23:01,759 --> 00:23:02,480
Yes, sir.

366
00:23:11,759 --> 00:23:12,079
Identification.

367
00:23:12,119 --> 00:23:12,680
Identification.

368
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:15,119
Let's go.

369
00:23:16,279 --> 00:23:17,039
Identification.

370
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:20,480
Let's go.

371
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:24,119
What do you want?

372
00:23:24,119 --> 00:23:25,359
I want peanuts.

373
00:23:25,359 --> 00:23:26,559
No sunflower seeds.

374
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:26,960
Okay.

375
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:27,799
Then just peanuts.

376
00:23:27,799 --> 00:23:28,319
Identification.

377
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:28,839
Alright, alright.

378
00:23:29,839 --> 00:23:30,200
Hurry up.

379
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,200
Show your identification.

380
00:23:31,759 --> 00:23:33,039
Yuichi Gangcun.

381
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:33,880
You in the back, show your identification.

382
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:34,680
Where are you from?

383
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,160
What are you doing in Shanghai?

384
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,559
Bastard.

385
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:40,839
I have urgent business.

386
00:23:40,839 --> 00:23:41,759
Don't get in the way.

387
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:42,720
Mr. Gangcun, please calm down.

388
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,599
Still can't avoid being involved with the Japanese.

389
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:45,319
Please don't take offense.

390
00:23:45,319 --> 00:23:46,680
Newcomer, newcomer.

391
00:23:49,839 --> 00:23:51,000
Thank you, sir.

392
00:23:52,319 --> 00:23:53,240
Wait a moment.

393
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:56,480
Put this on.

394
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,119
It'll keep you warm.

395
00:23:57,119 --> 00:23:58,599
Thank you, thank you, sir.

396
00:23:58,599 --> 00:24:00,279
Thank you, thank you, sir.

397
00:24:00,279 --> 00:24:00,920
Thank you.

398
00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:06,720
What are you always looking at?

399
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,279
Hurry up and weigh the peanuts.

400
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:11,000
Not selling anymore, not selling.

401
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:14,119
Why are you so strange?

402
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:20,559
Director Cui

403
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,160
Director Cui

404
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:25,519
Director Cui

405
00:24:25,759 --> 00:24:26,480
Director Cui

406
00:24:27,519 --> 00:24:29,039
These belong to Director Liang.

407
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,200
Who told you to move these?

408
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,240
It was the director's order.

409
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,599
We don't know why, either.

410
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:34,759
Put the things back.

411
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:36,359
Isn't that inappropriate?

412
00:24:36,359 --> 00:24:37,519
The director gave the order personally.

413
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:38,559
Are you deaf?

414
00:24:38,839 --> 00:24:40,359
I told you to put the things back.

415
00:24:41,319 --> 00:24:42,640
Didn't you hear what I said?

416
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:43,920
Put the things down.

417
00:24:44,079 --> 00:24:44,839
Get out.

418
00:24:44,839 --> 00:24:45,640
Yes.

419
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,559
Director.

420
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,279
See for yourself.

421
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:09,319
The person who died in Yulong Mountain was one of ours.

422
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,839
But we're only finding out about it now.

423
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,119
You, as the head of intelligence,

424
00:25:14,119 --> 00:25:15,400
how are you doing your job?

425
00:25:15,559 --> 00:25:17,240
That assassin has already arrived in Shanghai,

426
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:19,319
and it was the military police who informed us.

427
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,480
Say something.

428
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,599
It was my negligence.

429
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,400
I will investigate this matter immediately.

430
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,200
Investigate.

431
00:25:28,359 --> 00:25:29,559
Of course you have to investigate.

432
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,599
But you,

433
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,960
should at least have a plan.

434
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:36,799
I know.

435
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,240
At Yulong Mountain,

436
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,119
we lost a valuable member.

437
00:25:40,359 --> 00:25:41,640
You must feel bad about it.

438
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:42,680
Right?

439
00:25:44,119 --> 00:25:45,319
Life and death are up to fate.

440
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,480
Given the current situation,

441
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:50,960
we can't afford to let emotions get in the way.

442
00:25:51,559 --> 00:25:52,440
You

443
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,079
are the person I trust the most.

444
00:25:54,079 --> 00:25:55,319
But trust

445
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,880
is built on a foundation.

446
00:25:57,759 --> 00:25:58,559
Do you understand?

447
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,519
Please rest assured, Director.

448
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,839
I will do everything I can to catch this assassin.

449
00:26:02,839 --> 00:26:04,240
I won't let down your trust in me.

450
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,880
Rickshaw!

451
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,599
Miss, where are you headed?

452
00:26:09,599 --> 00:26:10,400
To the train station.

453
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:10,839
Alright.

454
00:26:10,839 --> 00:26:11,839
Newspapers for sale!

455
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:12,519
Take a look!

456
00:26:12,519 --> 00:26:14,079
Excuse me, please make way, make way.

457
00:26:14,079 --> 00:26:15,240
Papers for sale!

458
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,039
Come take a look at the papers!

459
00:26:18,039 --> 00:26:19,240
Come and see!

460
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:25,039
Newspapers for sale!

461
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,440
Make way, make way!

462
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:29,839
Who are the people in these cars?

463
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:31,839
Why am I with them?

464
00:26:32,119 --> 00:26:33,519
Why did they...

465
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,240
all die?

466
00:26:36,319 --> 00:26:37,680
In this puzzle,

467
00:26:38,079 --> 00:26:40,039
what secret is really hidden?

468
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:54,960
Please.

469
00:26:57,519 --> 00:27:00,000
Mr. Mizuno's tea ceremony skills

470
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,960
are truly breathtaking.

471
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:04,480
The Japanese tea ceremony originated from China.

472
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,559
The tea ceremony reflects

473
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:09,160
the native culture of China.

474
00:27:09,759 --> 00:27:11,319
To do our work better in the future,

475
00:27:11,319 --> 00:27:13,359
we must learn

476
00:27:13,359 --> 00:27:15,519
their culture.

477
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,200
On the Chinese battlefield,

478
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,480
we have faced such difficulties.

479
00:27:19,559 --> 00:27:20,519
This shows

480
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,880
that we have always underestimated this country.

481
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:23,880
Yes.

482
00:27:24,279 --> 00:27:25,480
You are absolutely right.

483
00:27:25,799 --> 00:27:27,599
Our current strategy is

484
00:27:27,599 --> 00:27:28,599
to use the Chinese to control the Chinese.

485
00:27:29,319 --> 00:27:31,359
The reason I transferred you to Unit 76

486
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:32,559
is because you

487
00:27:32,599 --> 00:27:35,480
don't have the overbearing air of a military family.

488
00:27:35,839 --> 00:27:37,079
When dealing with the Chinese,

489
00:27:37,319 --> 00:27:39,279
relying on intimidation alone is far from enough.

490
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,680
I understand.

491
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:55,799
Yan Jiu is the main criminal being escorted this time.

492
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,440
According to previous investigations,

493
00:27:58,680 --> 00:27:59,960
he is not a member of the Military Bureau.

494
00:28:00,119 --> 00:28:01,880
But the Bureau used his caravan

495
00:28:02,039 --> 00:28:04,839
to transport a batch of powerful explosives to Shanghai.

496
00:28:06,359 --> 00:28:09,519
He did die in this ambush.

497
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:11,359
This man is not simple.

498
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,519
It's just a pity

499
00:28:13,839 --> 00:28:15,240
that all information has been cut off.

500
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,200
Truth

501
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,480
is always hidden in the light.

502
00:28:36,839 --> 00:28:37,640
Sir

503
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,400
Would you like to buy a puzzle?

504
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,079
Boss

505
00:28:41,799 --> 00:28:43,720
You've had this shop for over ten years, right?

506
00:28:44,359 --> 00:28:45,880
I've been running it for more than twenty years.

507
00:28:46,279 --> 00:28:47,799
Then do you recognize this?

508
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,960
You want to buy this puzzle?

509
00:28:50,319 --> 00:28:51,279
Just this piece.

510
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,680
It might be pretty hard to find.

511
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,680
There are quite a few buildings like this in Shanghai.

512
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,279
There are also many in the French Concession.

513
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,880
The person from the train station earlier was him.

514
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,000
Let's go.

515
00:29:24,039 --> 00:29:24,599
Hurry.

516
00:29:24,599 --> 00:29:25,160
Move aside.

517
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,079
Search.

518
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:42,759
You.

519
00:29:42,759 --> 00:29:43,799
Go over there.

520
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:52,519
Do you know me?

521
00:29:53,119 --> 00:29:54,200
Why are you following me?

522
00:29:54,519 --> 00:29:55,519
Sir

523
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,920
You've got the wrong person.

524
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,759
I'm just passing by.

525
00:29:59,200 --> 00:29:59,920
Really?

526
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:02,279
From Ding'an Road to Shikumen,

527
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,279
you really have been "just passing by" the whole way.

528
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,200
You scoundrel!

529
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,920
Everyone should punish you.

530
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,839
What's that sound?

531
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:25,720
Murder!

532
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:26,920
Someone's been killed!

533
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,240
Murder!

534
00:30:28,599 --> 00:30:29,640
Murder!

535
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,039
Murder!

536
00:30:31,319 --> 00:30:32,240
Over there!

537
00:30:32,319 --> 00:30:33,039
Hurry!

538
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,519
It's the man in the suit up ahead!

539
00:30:40,359 --> 00:30:40,880
Chase him!

540
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,160
Hurry!

541
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:49,359
Out of the way!

542
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,279
Where did he go?

543
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:52,960
Bastard!

544
00:31:46,119 --> 00:31:47,680
That bastard

545
00:31:48,359 --> 00:31:50,279
You have two tasks next

546
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,119
First

547
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:53,839
That batch of explosives is still missing

548
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,880
If the anti-Japanese elements' target

549
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,400
is the Peace Conference

550
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,559
then the purpose of these explosives

551
00:31:59,559 --> 00:32:00,720
becomes obvious

552
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,000
We must find these explosives before the Military Bureau does

553
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,359
and locate this batch of explosives

554
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:06,039
They want to blow up the venue

555
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:07,960
That's truly reckless

556
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:09,759
This is just my speculation

557
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,359
We are already monitoring

558
00:32:11,359 --> 00:32:13,160
all of Yan Jiu's assets

559
00:32:13,359 --> 00:32:14,640
If anyone comes to investigate

560
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,960
they will never return

561
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,599
The second matter is

562
00:32:18,599 --> 00:32:20,319
We must quickly find the killer

563
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,680
How many killers are there

564
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,160
According to the Manchuria report

565
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:25,880
One person

566
00:32:26,359 --> 00:32:26,960
What

567
00:32:27,759 --> 00:32:28,640
Only one person

568
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:29,759
That's right

569
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,319
Their assassination and retreat methods

570
00:32:32,319 --> 00:32:33,559
are extremely skilled

571
00:32:33,759 --> 00:32:35,359
Based on the traces at the scene

572
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:38,000
it's impossible to determine the truth

573
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,599
It's very likely the work of the Military Bureau

574
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,279
But rest assured, Chief

575
00:32:42,519 --> 00:32:43,640
No matter who it is

576
00:32:43,799 --> 00:32:45,480
as long as they're anti-Japanese

577
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:46,920
their fate

578
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:49,240
will only be a corpse

579
00:33:01,759 --> 00:33:02,480
It's ready

580
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,200
Uncle, Uncle

581
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,000
I want a haircut.

582
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:19,720
Alright.

583
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:22,880
Young master, have you eaten?

584
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:23,400
I have.

585
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,039
Really?

586
00:33:24,039 --> 00:33:24,720
Really.

587
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:52,359
Why does everything here

588
00:33:52,359 --> 00:33:53,720
feel so familiar?

589
00:33:59,319 --> 00:34:00,119
Uncle, Uncle

590
00:34:00,119 --> 00:34:01,519
I want to buy chestnuts.

591
00:34:02,079 --> 00:34:03,519
Young master, what would you like to eat?

592
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:05,359
I want chestnuts and peanuts.

593
00:34:05,359 --> 00:34:06,160
How about having some of this?

594
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:06,640
Okay.

595
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:07,759
Alright, I'll pack it for you.

596
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:16,880
Boss

597
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,400
Give me half a jin of chestnuts.

598
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:19,480
Alright.

599
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:21,480
And one jin of peanuts.

600
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:22,119
Okay.

601
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:23,719
Hold it carefully.

602
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:24,440
Thank you.

603
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:27,639
Can this puzzle give me the answer I want?

604
00:34:49,519 --> 00:34:50,639
It's right here.

605
00:34:51,039 --> 00:34:52,199
Maybe my answer

606
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:53,519
is right here.

607
00:35:05,719 --> 00:35:07,159
A Japanese seal.

608
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,599
The Japanese.

609
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:11,960
Yulong Mountain

610
00:35:13,159 --> 00:35:14,480
Puzzle

611
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:34,320
Ruijin Pharmaceuticals

612
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,679
Master Jiu

613
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,559
A pharmaceutical company

614
00:35:55,559 --> 00:35:58,360
Is it really worth all this trouble for the Japanese?

615
00:35:59,159 --> 00:36:01,639
What exactly are they trying to find here?

616
00:36:05,199 --> 00:36:07,440
Hey, search everything carefully.

617
00:36:08,039 --> 00:36:09,599
Don't miss any details.

618
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:10,639
Yes, yes.

619
00:36:26,719 --> 00:36:28,159
Be careful.

620
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,559
Search carefully.

621
00:36:29,559 --> 00:36:30,119
Yes.

622
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:49,039
There's a secret room here.

623
00:36:49,239 --> 00:36:49,920
Everyone, come here quickly.

624
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:50,719
Yes, yes.

625
00:37:33,199 --> 00:37:34,480
The same puzzle

626
00:37:35,159 --> 00:37:36,880
It seems the answer is right here

627
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,320
Go look for it

628
00:37:53,519 --> 00:37:54,679
The key

629
00:37:56,639 --> 00:37:57,719
Yes

630
00:37:58,719 --> 00:38:00,000
Find the key

631
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,719
The seal is still here

632
00:38:03,719 --> 00:38:06,320
Maybe what they want is still here too

633
00:38:06,599 --> 00:38:08,199
Such a small secret room

634
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,480
Where could it be hidden

635
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,199
Look

636
00:38:18,559 --> 00:38:19,719
When people turn on the light

637
00:38:19,719 --> 00:38:21,760
they only pay attention to the places that are lit

638
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,360
But the truth

639
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:25,239
is always hidden within the light

640
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:11,639
Mr. Mizuno

641
00:39:11,639 --> 00:39:12,320
You’ve arrived.

642
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,079
This way, please.

643
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,119
Mr. Mizuno

644
00:39:14,119 --> 00:39:16,119
Will you have Yandang Maofeng tea again today?

645
00:39:17,079 --> 00:39:18,039
Tell your boss

646
00:39:18,039 --> 00:39:18,800
that I’m here.

647
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,079
I’d like to ask her to perform a solo.

648
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:20,880
Alright.

649
00:39:21,039 --> 00:39:21,840
I’ll go call her right away.

650
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:22,880
Please go upstairs.

651
00:39:28,119 --> 00:39:28,920
Xiao Zhou

652
00:39:32,559 --> 00:39:33,559
Take this medicine

653
00:39:33,639 --> 00:39:35,519
and deliver it to the guest at Pingchuan Academy.

654
00:39:35,519 --> 00:39:36,320
Be quick.

655
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,400
Hand it to her personally.

656
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:38,400
Yes.

657
00:41:04,599 --> 00:41:05,639
Within these four walls,

658
00:41:05,639 --> 00:41:07,880
one can still savor the vastness of the sky and earth,

659
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:09,519
and the vitality of all living things.

660
00:41:10,159 --> 00:41:11,280
Miss Jiang's pipa performance

661
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,079
is truly one of Shanghai's finest.

662
00:41:13,639 --> 00:41:16,159
And now you've opened such an elegant academy.

663
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:18,320
I am truly impressed.

664
00:41:19,239 --> 00:41:20,239
Mr. Mizuno,

665
00:41:20,239 --> 00:41:21,280
you flatter me.

666
00:41:21,559 --> 00:41:22,760
To hear music is to perceive one's nature.

667
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:23,639
In my opinion,

668
00:41:23,639 --> 00:41:25,159
Miss Jiang is like a

669
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:26,519
noble

670
00:41:26,519 --> 00:41:28,440
and exceptionally skilled lotus flower.

671
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,079
Our Empire of Japan greatly appreciates

672
00:41:31,079 --> 00:41:32,599
artists like Miss Jiang.

673
00:41:32,599 --> 00:41:33,400
I also hope

674
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,199
to interact with people like Miss Jiang

675
00:41:35,199 --> 00:41:38,119
and promote cultural and artistic exchange between Japan and China.

676
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:42,480
If Mr. Mizuno does not mind my humble music,

677
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,360
it is my honor.

678
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,400
If Chinese artists

679
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,280
were all as insightful as Miss Jiang,

680
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:52,000
and could influence the general public at the right time,

681
00:41:52,239 --> 00:41:54,400
to dispel their anti-Japanese sentiments,

682
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:55,880
then

683
00:41:56,039 --> 00:41:57,599
an era of peace and shared prosperity

684
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:58,960
would soon be upon us.

685
00:42:01,239 --> 00:42:02,239
Mr. Mizuno,

686
00:42:02,239 --> 00:42:04,199
you overestimate us artists.

687
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:07,199
I, Feiman, do not have such influence.

688
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:09,760
In the north, people listen to Peking Opera.

689
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,119
In the south, they prefer Kunqu Opera.

690
00:42:11,679 --> 00:42:13,079
In Suzhou and Shanghai, many enjoy storytelling and ballad singing.

691
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:15,800
Miss Jiang, do not underestimate the power of art.

692
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:18,800
Mr. Mizuno, you flatter me.

693
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:28,639
Miss Jiang

694
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:30,280
I still have matters to attend to today

695
00:42:30,679 --> 00:42:31,760
We didn't get to talk as much as I'd like

696
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:33,039
Today's topics

697
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:34,800
Let's continue another day

698
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:36,599
Take care on your way

699
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:45,559
Mr. Mizuno

700
00:42:45,559 --> 00:42:46,760
This way, please. This way.

701
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:54,679
Miss Jiang

702
00:42:55,159 --> 00:42:56,280
I've brought you your medicine

703
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:57,679
Thank you

704
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:05,679
Miss Jiang
