1
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,200
What are you doing?

2
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,310
Let Director Liang go, now!

3
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:54,510
What's going on here?

4
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,920
Can't you see for yourself?

5
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,840
What's with that attitude?

6
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:03,400
Go rescue the wounded immediately.

7
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,230
Let's go.

8
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,280
No need.

9
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:11,560
The remaining anti-Japanese elements are still nearby and haven't gotten far.

10
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:13,190
Hurry up and search!

11
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:17,520
This guy...

12
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:20,590
If he hadn't blocked the alley with his car,

13
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:23,520
we wouldn't have suffered such heavy casualties.

14
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:25,150
Don't talk nonsense.

15
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:26,030
Takagi.

16
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:28,430
Did the explosion rattle your brain?

17
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,430
I think Takagi has misunderstood.

18
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:34,280
I was helping him capture the agents.

19
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:35,870
But as soon as we reached the warehouse entrance,

20
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:37,240
an explosion happened.

21
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,360
Maybe the military police didn't evacuate in time.

22
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:43,470
So Mr. Takagi is taking it out on me.

23
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,470
Of course.

24
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,520
Or maybe it's because Mr. Takagi

25
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:49,360
was disoriented by the explosion.

26
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:50,470
Boss.

27
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,470
Boss.

28
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,520
You're hurt!

29
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:54,470
I'm fine.

30
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,840
Go inside and check right away.

31
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,710
See if any Chongqing agents

32
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,470
are still alive.

33
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,560
Okay.

34
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:05,870
Mr. Takagi.

35
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,960
You understand the situation now, right?

36
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:11,870
We came here after receiving Director Liang's report.

37
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:13,590
That's why we rushed over.

38
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,840
No matter what happened,

39
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,870
let's return to headquarters first.

40
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:23,590
Take Takagi and Mr. Liang to the hospital for treatment immediately.

41
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:24,840
Yes, sir.

42
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,400
This way, please.

43
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,000
Liang Jun

44
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,870
How are you? Are you okay?

45
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:36,000
Do you want to go to the hospital first?

46
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:37,280
I'm fine.

47
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,470
I have to go back to the Special Agent Headquarters first.

48
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:41,520
Things developed suddenly.

49
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,910
This is very important.

50
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:45,310
I need to report to Director Li first.

51
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:46,750
Then

52
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,800
Thank you for your hard work.

53
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:49,000
It's my duty.

54
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:46,630
Chief

55
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:49,750
Mr. Lu made an important discovery at the Pingjia Lane warehouse.

56
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:50,790
Let's go.

57
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,480
Are there any survivors?

58
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:53,510
No, none.

59
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:10,080
This is where they hid the explosives.

60
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,030
I didn't expect this.

61
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:17,790
Yan Jiu really is cunning.

62
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:20,550
He hid it right under our noses.

63
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:22,510
Mr. Lu

64
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:23,670
Thank you for your hard work.

65
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:41,960
It's safe.

66
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,440
What a pity.

67
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,630
Most of it has already been taken away.

68
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,750
Only this bit was left behind.

69
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,150
Chief

70
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:07,510
We've found something.

71
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,390
Mr. Lu

72
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:22,720
Today

73
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,670
we've made some gains.

74
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,150
Take it back.

75
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:28,150
Yes, sir.

76
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:32,360
Transport all these contraband items back.

77
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:34,550
Move faster.

78
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:51,510
Director Hirata

79
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,550
The chief wants to see you and Director Lu.

80
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,390
This way, please.

81
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,390
It's a complete mess.

82
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,510
Wang Qiaosu just died like that.

83
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,510
How am I supposed to explain this to Chief Mizuno?

84
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:09,390
Support from Unit 76 arrived too late.

85
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:11,480
If we had blocked North Street earlier,

86
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:13,080
the casualties wouldn't have been so heavy.

87
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,320
For this matter,

88
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,080
Liang Shuo should take half the responsibility.

89
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:17,630
Mr. Takagi,

90
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:19,630
Director Liang has to return to headquarters to report.

91
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,150
He also had to lead a team to support you.

92
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,720
He can't be in two places at once.

93
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,750
We don't even know who it was.

94
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:27,240
It was too reckless.

95
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:29,200
He ran straight into the Juntong's trap.

96
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,750
And now you're trying to shift the blame.

97
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:31,790
You bastard.

98
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:32,550
That's enough.

99
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:34,120
You're still arguing at a time like this.

100
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,240
Have you no shame?

101
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,630
Isn't this embarrassing enough for you?

102
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:40,320
Come in.

103
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:43,670
Chief.

104
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:44,750
Director Hirata is here.

105
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:46,390
Alright.

106
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,150
Miss Hirata, thank you for your hard work.

107
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:56,480
Please, have a seat.

108
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,360
The site investigation—

109
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:00,600
Did you find anything?

110
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,000
At the scene,

111
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,440
we didn't find much.

112
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,390
But outside the scene,

113
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,870
we did make another discovery.

114
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,270
So that means

115
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:10,510
there's good news?

116
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,000
Director Lu

117
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:14,910
has been secretly helping us with the investigation.

118
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:17,360
Tracking down where Yan Jiu hid the explosives.

119
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:20,150
Now, we've finally made some progress.

120
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,870
The explosives

121
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
are hidden

122
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,750
in a secret basement on Pingjia Lane.

123
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,480
Pingjia Lane?

124
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,790
That's quite a coincidence.

125
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,270
This place

126
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:34,000
isn't far from the explosion site.

127
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:34,600
Right.

128
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,270
Just one street away.

129
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,440
The Chongqing agents

130
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:40,840
were clearly very deliberate.

131
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:43,240
We also found

132
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,440
an encrypted message in the secret basement.

133
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,150
It should be from the Military Bureau.

134
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:51,960
Secretary Wang,

135
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,600
have the communications team come over.

136
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:54,870
Decode it on site.

137
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:56,320
No one is allowed to leave.

138
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:57,960
Yes.

139
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:29,670
Director

140
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,790
It's been deciphered.

141
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,000
Very good.

142
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,670
Read it.

143
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:35,120
The Woodcutter Plan succeeded.

144
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,200
I have also escaped.

145
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:37,630
Will stop at nothing

146
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:39,440
to deal a heavy blow to the enemy.

147
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:41,270
I have also escaped.

148
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:42,910
Whose tone is this?

149
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,630
Chen Gengsheng.

150
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:46,670
Director, please judge.

151
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,670
The deciphered code does indeed match

152
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:51,000
the private code Chen Gengsheng used before.

153
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:54,240
This Chen Gengsheng...

154
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:55,790
He's really something.

155
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,600
It seems the Woodcutter

156
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:59,840
refers to Wang Qiaosu.

157
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,670
This person is so cunning,

158
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:03,360
he even faked surrender.

159
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,630
Wang and Chen

160
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:05,910
colluded in private.

161
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,200
They even fooled the chief.

162
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:08,960
Impossible!

163
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,320
I personally interrogated Wang Qiaosu.

164
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:13,120
I know best whether he faked surrender.

165
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:14,670
Mr. Takagi,

166
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,840
in the face of solid evidence,

167
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,200
there's no need to continue

168
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,670
making meaningless arguments.

169
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:20,480
What do you mean?

170
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,320
These Chongqing agents...

171
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,750
They're so scheming.

172
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,910
They really made Captain Gao Mu

173
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,390
suffer quite a loss.

174
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:39,080
This time,

175
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,320
thanks to Director Liang's vigilance,

176
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,200
otherwise,

177
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,150
the casualties would have been even worse.

178
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,150
That Chen Gengsheng...

179
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:48,510
He's truly despicable.

180
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,480
If he hadn't led me

181
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,240
to suspect Director Liang,

182
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:53,440
he wouldn't have been able

183
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,240
to stir up so much trouble.

184
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:57,120
I, Liang, failed to stop

185
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,630
Chen Gengsheng and Wang Qiaosu.

186
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,510
I achieved nothing and am truly ashamed.

187
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:02,910
This time,

188
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:04,390
although there were some losses,

189
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:08,200
we've also cleansed the ranks within headquarters.

190
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:10,200
So it wasn't a total loss.

191
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:12,360
Director Liang,

192
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,200
I apologize for having doubted you before.

193
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:17,360
From now on,

194
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,600
let's work well together.

195
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:19,150
I

196
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,960
will never treat you unfairly.

197
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:22,510
You're too kind, Chief.

198
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,240
This is simply my duty.

199
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:38,270
Chen Gengsheng's office has been searched by the military police.

200
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,870
This is his secret codebook.

201
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:41,550
According to our previous plan,

202
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,390
we'll forge a secret telegram and shift the blame eastward.

203
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:45,270
As long as this blame falls on Wang Qiaosu,

204
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,000
our plan will be a success.

205
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,200
Good.

206
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:07,150
Who are you people?

207
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:08,320
Chen Gengsheng.

208
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:10,320
Pick a spot for yourself.

209
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,080
Chen Gengsheng.

210
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,200
You traitor.

211
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:13,550
At No. 76,

212
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:15,360
you caused the deaths of so many innocent compatriots.

213
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,030
Letting you die like this

214
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,600
is really letting you off easy.

215
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:32,390
Xiuquan.

216
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:32,960
Here.

217
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,910
I told you to put away Chen Gengsheng's codebook.

218
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:35,960
Did you put it away properly?

219
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:36,960
Reporting, Director.

220
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,510
I put it in the safe in the records room.

221
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:02,030
What's wrong?

222
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,150
It's probably rusted.

223
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:05,670
Try harder.

224
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:06,720
It's really hard to open.

225
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,320
Use more force.

226
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:17,960
Director.

227
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:24,160
Director.

228
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:25,590
Why do you need this notebook?

229
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:29,640
Put it back.

230
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:31,750
Put it back.

231
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:35,440
Put it back.

232
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:49,960
My superior wants to see you.

233
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:50,960
Come with me.

234
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:04,680
Come.

235
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:06,590
Please have some water.

236
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:09,480
Thank you.

237
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:20,110
We

238
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:22,880
probably haven't met before.

239
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,070
That's right.

240
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:28,160
I am

241
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:29,790
Comrade Maple's superior.

242
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,830
And also a friend.

243
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:33,160
I'm a few years older than you.

244
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:34,680
You can call me Old Tan.

245
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:35,880
Old Tan.

246
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,550
This name

247
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:42,960
sounds familiar.

248
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,110
It seems

249
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,070
you've recovered well.

250
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,200
If you don't mind,

251
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:52,750
I'd like to check your pulse.

252
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,480
Your pulse

253
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,310
is still quite steady.

254
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:19,240
It seems

255
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:20,510
the recovery is going well.

256
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,440
But

257
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,070
because of your wound

258
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:27,000
which affected your head,

259
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:28,350
whether

260
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:29,400
the old injury will recur

261
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,310
or

262
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:31,510
leave any aftereffects,

263
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,350
I'm not completely sure.

264
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:34,270
It seems

265
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:35,790
further examination is needed.

266
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,720
I'll have Comrade Feiman arrange it for you.

267
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:42,110
I should have died back at Yulong Mountain.

268
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,960
This life is borrowed.

269
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,880
Every extra day is a bonus.

270
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:47,550
I'm not concerned about that.

271
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,070
I just want to know

272
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:52,510
Maple

273
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,790
what kind of person he really is.

274
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,440
Life

275
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,200
is not just about surviving.

276
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:04,270
It is about

277
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:06,550
seeking the light and forging the soul,

278
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,200
and being determined to pass on the torch.

279
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,640
This was what Comrade Fengye

280
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,000
said to me

281
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,160
when we first met.

282
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,200
He said,

283
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:18,030
Life

284
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:20,830
is not about having one more moment to breathe,

285
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:23,510
but about seeking the light,

286
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:25,030
forging one's will,

287
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:26,750
and passing on wisdom.

288
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,480
I've heard these words before.

289
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:33,480
I really want to know

290
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:34,830
what happened to Comrade Fengye

291
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:36,400
before he sacrificed himself.

292
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,200
What exactly happened?

293
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:42,160
To protect my identity,

294
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:45,790
he used my sidearm

295
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,790
and shot himself.

296
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,240
He told me before

297
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:58,550
that the Abyssal Plan could only be completed by me.

298
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,350
What exactly is the Abyssal Plan?

299
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,720
I just can't remember at all.

300
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:05,830
And also,

301
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,160
his relationship with the military intelligence

302
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,200
and with Xie Jun'an,

303
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,720
what kind of relationship is it, really?

304
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,960
Comrade Maple's public identity

305
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,480
is

306
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:19,640
an entrepreneur in the pharmaceutical trade.

307
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:20,790
In reality,

308
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,350
he has always used this identity

309
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:24,400
to help the organization

310
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:25,830
raise funds

311
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:27,000
and gather intelligence.

312
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,720
He and Xie Jun'an

313
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,270
were friends from earlier years.

314
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:31,680
Xie Jun'an

315
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:32,480
did not know

316
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,110
Comrade Maple's true identity.

317
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:36,030
Their cooperation

318
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:37,680
was also

319
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:40,270
carried out as a private matter.

320
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:41,270
As for

321
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:42,830
the Abyssal Plan,

322
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,310
A blizzard is coming

323
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:51,270
Stealthily moving through the abyss

324
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:52,920
In besieged Shanghai

325
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,270
Rescuing nearly two thousand labor refugees

326
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,440
It's just like

327
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:00,160
being in a dark abyss

328
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,270
moving in secret

329
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,030
on the edge between life and death

330
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,030
with no room for the slightest mistake

331
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:10,070
Labor refugees

332
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:11,310
Two thousand people

333
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,030
You're not lying to me, are you?

334
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:15,200
The rescue operation for refugees in the Shanghai area

335
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,030
has always been, for us in Shanghai,

336
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:18,750
a key part of the mass anti-Japanese movement

337
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:19,750
and an important mission

338
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:21,590
During the preparations for the Peace Conference

339
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:22,750
the Japanese

340
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,110
tightened their control

341
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,310
and secretly detained two thousand laborers

342
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:26,960
by arresting and imprisoning them in secret

343
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:28,510
They plan

344
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:30,440
after the Peace Conference

345
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:31,720
to send them all

346
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,200
to the battlefield

347
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:34,790
By then

348
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,160
those two thousand people

349
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:37,440
not a single one

350
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,830
will be able to return alive

351
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:46,110
So what do you want me to do?

352
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,110
Time is running out.

353
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:49,790
Your mission

354
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:51,640
is to do whatever it takes

355
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,350
to gain the trust of the Japanese.

356
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:54,790
Get into the preparatory committee.

357
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:57,310
At the time of the peace conference,

358
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,680
find out the Japanese army's troop deployments.

359
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:01,160
Only then can we

360
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,480
carry out the Abyss Plan

361
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,310
and rescue all the laborers.

362
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:07,440
And get them safely out of Shanghai.

363
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:10,200
The Military Bureau's Snow Blind Plan

364
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,400
can buy us some time.

365
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:17,270
So Comrade Maple's identity as a businessman

366
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:18,270
and his role in receiving explosives

367
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,310
were also arranged by the organization.

368
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:21,480
That's right.

369
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:28,400
It's just a pity

370
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,440
he still sacrificed himself for me.

371
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:34,480
So what kind of relationship

372
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:37,680
did I have with him?

373
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,480
About Comrade Maple,

374
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:45,030
what else can you remember?

375
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:51,110
I vaguely remember

376
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,400
I called him Uncle Yan.

377
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,030
He was my adoptive father.

378
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:59,790
He was a close friend of my father.

379
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:02,440
After both my parents died,

380
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,240
he brought me to Shanghai.

381
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,350
Your parents were killed by the Japanese.

382
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,590
If you want to avenge them,

383
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:38,830
come with me.

384
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:42,720
Uncle.

385
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:44,350
You've grown up.

386
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,480
You can make your own choices now.

387
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:52,440
Uncle.

388
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:53,680
I want to go.

389
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:11,030
Child

390
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:13,110
I wasn't wrong about you

391
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,310
You made the right choice

392
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,750
Qingshuang admires Maple Leaf

393
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:20,270
A pale moon hides among the reeds

394
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,830
I am your handler, Maple Leaf

395
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:24,550
Starting today

396
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,350
your codename will be

397
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,590
Qingshuang

398
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,680
Comrade Qingshuang

399
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:31,680
Welcome home

400
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:45,590
I can't remember most things anymore.

401
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:47,790
I only remember

402
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:51,640
his blood splattering on my clothes

403
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:55,440
and the mission I failed to complete.

404
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:59,720
Maybe he said something else to me.

405
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:03,070
But I can't remember at all.

406
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,350
It's okay.

407
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:06,920
There will always be

408
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,270
a day when you remember.

409
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,270
I'm very confused.

410
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,310
This path

411
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:16,790
Should I keep going down this road?

412
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,510
Your mind

413
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:19,590
has been injured,

414
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:22,640
causing you to forget many things.

415
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:23,590
But

416
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,270
faith and mission

417
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:27,480
are engraved in your soul.

418
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:29,240
Just like now,

419
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:30,680
you have once again

420
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,030
come back here to find me.

421
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,400
If

422
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:35,680
you had another chance to choose,

423
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,110
I hope you choose

424
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:39,350
to truly become one of us.

425
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,000
Because now,

426
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,110
no one is more

427
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,830
suitable to complete this mission than you.

428
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,510
After eliminating Chen Gengsheng,

429
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:47,750
you have gained the trust of the Japanese.

430
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:48,830
You are now

431
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:50,000
at the heart of the storm.

432
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,640
The organization needs you.

433
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,920
Two thousand refugees

434
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,750
need you even more.

435
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,400
I understand.

436
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,550
Don't worry.

437
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,720
This was Uncle Yan's last wish.

438
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,240
I will fulfill it.

439
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:13,960
I don't want anyone else to die in vain.

440
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:16,640
Let alone two thousand people.

441
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:19,400
Alright.

442
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,030
That's great.

443
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,720
Comrade Qingshuang.

444
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:25,830
Welcome home.

445
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:45,880
Go inside.

446
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:47,830
This doctor was contacted by Old Tan.

447
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:49,440
Go get an X-ray first and have a look.

448
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,590
I don't want to leave any records.

449
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:53,550
To avoid unnecessary trouble.

450
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:55,590
That won't happen here.

451
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:36,720
But I must remind you

452
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,160
if this shrapnel isn't removed

453
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:42,310
it will have ongoing effects on your brain

454
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:44,000
the consequences could be very serious

455
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,480
so I

456
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,030
suggest you carry a

457
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,310
notebook

458
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:49,240
wherever you go

459
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,720
and record your life

460
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,830
it might help you in the future

461
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,070
Grinning so early in the morning.

462
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:30,030
You never act serious.

463
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:30,750
Boss.

464
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:31,750
Director.

465
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:33,550
If you knew what good thing is about to happen,

466
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:34,880
you wouldn't say that about me.

467
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:36,200
Are you stupid?

468
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:37,240
Still calling him Director?

469
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,510
What kind of act are you two putting on?

470
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,750
You'll find out soon.

471
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:43,160
Director Liang.

472
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,720
The chief wants to see you.

473
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,000
Help me put this back in the office later.

474
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:49,790
Alright.

475
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,270
See?

476
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:52,240
I told you so.

477
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:53,750
What nonsense are you talking about?

478
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:54,920
As if you could say anything.

479
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,400
Brother Yu, Brother Bai.

480
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,480
What exactly is the good news?

481
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,510
None of your business.

482
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:01,400
You'll know soon enough.

483
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,070
Old Xie

484
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:12,720
What do you mean?

485
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:14,510
What do you mean, "what do I mean"?

486
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,640
Why is Liang Shuo still at No. 76?

487
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:18,030
Didn't we agree on this?

488
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:19,590
After the Pingjia Lane matter is settled,

489
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:21,160
you'd find a way to get him out of Shanghai.

490
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,550
You think he can just leave whenever he wants?

491
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:24,550
Do you think the Special Operations Department is some kind of

492
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:25,720
warehouse

493
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:26,550
or trading company?

494
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:32,880
That's not what you said before.

495
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:35,110
Now that the mission has reached this stage,

496
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:36,880
new situations can arise at any time.

497
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,440
It's normal for plans to change.

498
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:40,920
Don't try to fool me.

499
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,110
I know

500
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,590
you have people and guns now,

501
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:44,440
and you have connections.

502
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:45,920
If you want to get someone out of Shanghai,

503
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,680
it's not that hard as long as you're willing.

504
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,920
Act only after careful planning and consideration.

505
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:51,680
My first priority is

506
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,480
to ensure the whole plan proceeds smoothly.

507
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,110
It wasn't easy for Liang Shuo

508
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:56,680
to regain the Japanese's trust.

509
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,640
If he leaves suddenly,

510
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,200
he'll definitely be suspected.

511
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,110
That would be a loss outweighing the gain.

512
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:03,160
I think you

513
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,960
have been playing me from the start.

514
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:05,960
Haven't you?

515
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:09,310
I promised I'd consider this matter,

516
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,830
and of course I will.

517
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,070
Liar.

518
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,400
Have you had breakfast?

519
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:24,400
Director Liang

520
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:26,920
The Central Executive Committee's approval has come through.

521
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,510
Congratulations on your promotion.

522
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:31,550
It's all thanks to your guidance, Director.

523
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,110
From now on,

524
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,590
you are not only the Director of the Special Operations Headquarters,

525
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:36,790
but also concurrently

526
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:39,400
the Deputy Director of the Special Inspection Division under the Central Executive Committee.

527
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:40,750
As for your rank,

528
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:41,880
it has been raised by one level.

529
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:44,790
The importance of this responsibility goes without saying.

530
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:46,350
This promotion

531
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:48,480
was jointly nominated by Director Zhou of the Special Committee

532
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,880
and Chief Mizuno of the Mei Agency.

533
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,880
Chairman Wang gave special approval.

534
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,440
You must not let down

535
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,310
Chairman Wang's expectations.

536
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,640
If it weren't for your recommendation, Director,

537
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:01,680
I wouldn't be where I am today.

538
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,590
Thanks to the support of all the superiors,

539
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:05,680
I will do my utmost.

540
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:08,640
Let's skip the formalities.

541
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,720
You are my most capable subordinate.

542
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,350
With you leaving the Special Operations Headquarters,

543
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:13,720
I am truly reluctant.

544
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:16,440
But for the sake of the new government's plans,

545
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:18,720
I have no choice but to let you go.

546
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,110
Fortunately, the Central Executive Committee

547
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:21,480
has made things easier for your work

548
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:22,750
by specially approving

549
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:24,960
that you continue to work at No. 76.

550
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,680
Coordinate the follow-up work for the Peace Conference

551
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,830
and the liaison with No. 76.

552
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:32,310
The award ceremony will be held at noon.

553
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,350
At that time,

554
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,590
many Japanese representatives will attend.

555
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,830
Get yourself ready.

556
00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:39,030
Yes, sir.

557
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:41,070
Secretary Wang

558
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:44,510
Open it.

559
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:46,750
Director Liang, please have a look.

560
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:52,920
This is—

561
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:54,640
You've already been promoted.

562
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,480
As your former supervisor,

563
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,350
of course I have to show my appreciation.

564
00:32:58,350 --> 00:33:00,000
But after thinking it over,

565
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,030
I felt that

566
00:33:01,030 --> 00:33:03,440
your office decor is a bit sparse.

567
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,880
So I asked someone to go to the market

568
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:08,920
and find an authentic landscape painting by Master Shiqiao.

569
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,110
Take a look.

570
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:12,110
It's truly the work of a master.

571
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:13,480
The artistic conception is profound.

572
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:16,790
Thank you for your thoughtfulness, Director.

573
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,960
You’ve placed deep affection and friendship into this painting.

574
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:22,160
It truly moves me.

575
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:24,400
But this calligraphy is extraordinary.

576
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,720
If you give it to me,

577
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:26,750
it really feels a bit

578
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:28,110
like a cow chewing on peonies.

579
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:30,400
Don’t say that.

580
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,750
You have a bright future ahead.

581
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:34,830
From now on, your journey will be grand.

582
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,000
If you keep refusing,

583
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:40,110
you’ll really let down my

584
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:41,790
sincere intentions.

585
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:44,750
Then I will

586
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,750
accept it with some guilt,

587
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,350
and it would be impolite to decline.

588
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,160
Take it, take it.

589
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,200
Let’s not leave until we’re drunk!

590
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:53,880
Coming!

591
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:54,790
Welcome.

592
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:55,960
Welcome, welcome.

593
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:58,000
Director of the Special Investigation Division, Special Affairs Committee.

594
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:58,830
Director Liang.

595
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:01,160
Director Liang.

596
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,270
Congratulations and best wishes for prosperity!

597
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:03,720
You’ve been promoted this time.

598
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:04,920
We old friends

599
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:06,550
hope you’ll look out for us more.

600
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:08,110
Director Liang.

601
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,270
From now on, all of us brothers

602
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:12,720
hope to share in your good fortune.

603
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:13,480
That’s right.

604
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,840
Let’s not talk about sharing fortune just yet.

605
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:17,510
Just call me Director Liang.

606
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:18,760
It sounds more friendly.

607
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:22,670
I’ll be relying on all of you to help shoulder responsibilities from now on.

608
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:23,760
He’s quite modest.

609
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,550
Come on.

610
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,190
Congratulations!

611
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,230
Director Liang.

612
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:30,510
Director Lu has something to discuss.

613
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:33,070
May we speak privately for a moment?

614
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,070
Of course.

615
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:36,590
Excuse me, everyone.

616
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:37,070
Alright.

617
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:46,190
Director Liang has worked hard for many years.

618
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:47,630
Today, your wish has finally come true.

619
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:48,670
Congratulations.

620
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:50,230
People always strive to move up.

621
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,230
Naturally, it takes hard work and effort.

622
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:54,320
Director Lu, your words are rather neutral.

623
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,510
If others hear this,

624
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,880
I'm afraid

625
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,630
they might misunderstand and think you're envious.

626
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,280
I do admire Director Liang.

627
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:02,320
No matter where you go,

628
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,710
you're always the center of attention.

629
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:06,670
You always seize the best opportunities.

630
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:08,590
Everything goes smoothly for you.

631
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:09,840
Unlike me,

632
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,110
I'm a useless person.

633
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:14,550
I always show up at the worst times.

634
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,480
I even get used by others.

635
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:17,920
Cleaning up their messes.

636
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,590
And end up being disliked.

637
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:21,760
Director Lu, as soon as you took over headquarters,

638
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,590
you immediately solved the Pingjia Lane explosives case.

639
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:25,550
Your abilities are outstanding.

640
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:26,840
Everyone can see that.

641
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,550
How could anyone dislike you?

642
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,230
If Director Liang weren't so upright,

643
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:35,550
and willing to let this credit gather dust in a drawer,

644
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:37,670
I wouldn't have had the chance to take the credit.

645
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:39,590
Director Lu, you're too modest.

646
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:41,150
I, Liang, fight for every bit of merit.

647
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,400
You were able to seize the opportunity,

648
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,920
all thanks to your own abilities.

649
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:45,760
I, Liang,

650
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,070
am truly convinced.

651
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,710
Director Liang, you are also very meticulous.

652
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:51,760
Your calculations are always spot on.

653
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:52,760
It's admirable.

654
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:54,030
It's just a pity

655
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:55,190
that after the transfer,

656
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,360
we'll have fewer chances to meet.

657
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,000
It's a bit regrettable.

658
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:01,110
I'm afraid

659
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:02,590
you'll be disappointed, Director Lu.

660
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:04,760
I'll still be staying at headquarters.

661
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:05,800
We

662
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:06,880
still have plenty of time ahead.

663
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:08,800
Alright.

664
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:10,590
Director-General.

665
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:13,440
Director Lu.

666
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:14,590
Director-General, the car is ready.

667
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:15,630
We can depart now.

668
00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:17,590
Director Lu, please excuse me.

669
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:21,000
Goodbye, Director Lu.

670
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,960
Congratulations, Director-General Liang.

671
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:29,030
Director Liang

672
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:30,000
Call me Boss

673
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:32,630
We're like brothers, no need to be so formal

674
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,190
Got it, Boss

675
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:35,800
Boss

676
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:38,840
Do you think Director Lu

677
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,110
has something against you?

678
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,150
What makes you say that?

679
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,670
It just feels like the way he looks at you

680
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:45,800
is like he holds a grudge

681
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,000
And judging by his face

682
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,710
he seems extremely competitive

683
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:49,960
You should be careful

684
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:51,480
You just got promoted after all

685
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,000
Someone might be jealous

686
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:56,400
How scheming are you, kid?

687
00:36:57,230 --> 00:36:58,590
Do you analyze my face

688
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,280
in front of others too?

689
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,440
No, no, Boss

690
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:03,670
About Director Lu

691
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:05,000
Don't go around talking about it

692
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:07,150
Don't cause yourself trouble

693
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:08,000
You hear me?

694
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:08,840
Understood, Boss

695
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,000
Let's go

696
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:11,550
Boss, put on your coat

697
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:12,280
It's cold outside

698
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,320
Director Liang

699
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:33,360
Director Liang

700
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,000
Hello

701
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:36,000
I am from the East China Administrative Committee

702
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:36,800
Supervisor of Industry

703
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:37,630
Gao Zhiyuan

704
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,670
This is

705
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:39,840
Central Supervisory Committee member

706
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:40,630
Mr. Hu Ming

707
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:41,480
I've heard so much about you

708
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,070
A pleasure to meet you

709
00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:44,920
Mr. Liu Yongfu from the Central Political Committee

710
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:45,670
Hello, hello

711
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:46,400
A pleasure to meet you

712
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:49,320
This is the Vice Chairman of the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association

713
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:51,440
and also the Minister to Japan, Mr. Wang Bochuan

714
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:52,440
Hello, hello

715
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,150
Hello

716
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:55,920
Director Liang, you hold such an important position at such a young age

717
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,960
You will surely become a pillar of the new government in the future

718
00:37:58,590 --> 00:37:59,360
Mr. Liang

719
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,550
We've all heard

720
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:02,400
that you led the team to crack the postal system

721
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:04,280
and the Chongqing elements within our organization

722
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:06,110
Such talent is truly rare

723
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,190
That is simply my duty

724
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:09,190
A storm is brewing

725
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:11,440
Anti-Japanese elements, before the Peace Conference

726
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,030
dare to act so recklessly

727
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:14,670
I'm afraid it will only get worse

728
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:15,920
and become even more intense

729
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,230
The new government will need

730
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:20,150
talented people like Mr. Liang even more in the future

731
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:20,840
That's right

732
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,190
We've long admired Mr. Liang's reputation

733
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:25,070
and our desire to befriend you grows by the day

734
00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:27,880
Brother Liang

735
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,630
Congratulations, congratulations!

736
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:30,630
Long time no see.

737
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:32,760
I didn't expect you to get promoted so quickly.

738
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:35,110
Truly something to celebrate, truly something to celebrate!

739
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:36,510
Mr. Li

740
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:38,360
So you already knew Director Liang.

741
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,760
Then hurry and introduce us.

742
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:40,630
That's right.

743
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:41,960
Brother Li

744
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:44,510
Long time no see. How have you been lately?

745
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:45,670
Thanks to your support.

746
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:46,550
Good, very good.

747
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:47,280
Director Liang

748
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:48,880
Chief Hirata

749
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,480
Director Liang, you all go ahead and talk.

750
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:52,000
We won't disturb you, we won't disturb you.

751
00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:55,510
Congratulations.

752
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:56,480
Director Liang

753
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:57,800
You truly deserve it.

754
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,670
It's all thanks to Miss Hirata's support.

755
00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:04,480
Director Liang

756
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,550
You've spent years carrying out missions away from home.

757
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,070
Occasions like this

758
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:09,630
aren't something you're used to.

759
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,320
I'm more used to fighting and killing.

760
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:12,670
Drinking and socializing

761
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:14,230
is indeed a bit overwhelming for me.

762
00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:17,400
The new government needs

763
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,670
practical talents like Director Liang.

764
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:22,710
Not those who just flatter and curry favor

765
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,550
and form cliques for personal gain.

766
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:26,840
There's an old Chinese saying

767
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,760
"If the water is too clear, there will be no fish."

768
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,440
They have their own way of living.

769
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:32,960
We just need to do our own jobs well.

770
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:33,710
That's enough.

771
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,710
Chief Mizuno

772
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,840
wants to see you.

773
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:44,880
The Third Shanghai Gendarmerie Battalion has suffered heavy losses.

774
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:49,670
The Chongqing faction is directly targeting the Peace Conference.

775
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,110
Meihua Hall

776
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:53,510
has not played its expected role.

777
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:56,070
Meanwhile, the special agency directly under the Nanjing government

778
00:39:56,070 --> 00:39:57,630
has even had infiltrators appear directly.

779
00:39:57,630 --> 00:39:58,480
I believe

780
00:39:58,550 --> 00:39:59,550
under these circumstances,

781
00:39:59,550 --> 00:40:01,030
implementing the 3-1 Plan as soon as possible

782
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:02,670
is highly practical.

783
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,840
The general speaks with conviction,

784
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:07,030
but seems to have forgotten one thing.

785
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,920
The Third Shanghai Gendarmerie Battalion

786
00:40:10,110 --> 00:40:12,360
does not appear to be under the jurisdiction of Meihua Hall.

787
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,960
A captain's command error

788
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:17,480
can be blamed on the intelligence agency.

789
00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:19,400
Furthermore,

790
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:22,320
the 3-1 Plan is too far-reaching.

791
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,440
A single move affects the whole situation.

792
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:26,280
Implementing it now

793
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,880
would be premature.

794
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,670
Mr. Sakata often says

795
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:32,510
the 3-1 Plan is a national weapon.

796
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:33,800
I would like to ask,

797
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,480
when should this weapon be used

798
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:37,030
to be considered mature?

799
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:39,920
Of course, this requires careful planning.

800
00:40:40,590 --> 00:40:42,800
Aren't we carefully planning right now?

801
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,590
Alright, that's enough.

802
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:46,400
This kind of mutual shirking of responsibility

803
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,360
is no longer a proper meeting.

804
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,590
Let's end today's meeting here.

805
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,110
Meeting adjourned.

806
00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:05,030
Please come in.

807
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,400
Mr. Liang,

808
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,150
your transfer to the Special Investigation Division

809
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:16,590
is well-deserved.

810
00:41:16,590 --> 00:41:17,840
Congratulations are in order.

811
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,230
Mr. Liang and I

812
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:20,480
have met once before.

813
00:41:20,670 --> 00:41:21,840
Mr. Liang's name

814
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,550
I hear it every day.

815
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:25,150
You flatter me, Chief.

816
00:41:26,030 --> 00:41:27,400
I have accomplished very little.

817
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:30,030
Yet I have received your care and promotion.

818
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:31,710
I am truly ashamed.

819
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:33,070
Mr. Liang,

820
00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:34,400
please have a seat.

821
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:36,190
Thank you, Chief.

822
00:41:41,590 --> 00:41:42,630
Mr. Liang

823
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:43,920
is both wise and brave.

824
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,710
He is a rare talent.

825
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,920
With his actions time and again,

826
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,880
he has proven his loyalty to the new government

827
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,480
and to the Empire of Japan.

828
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,400
The position of Deputy Director of the Special Investigation Division

829
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:54,710
could go to no one but you.

830
00:41:55,630 --> 00:41:57,190
As you Chinese say,

831
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:58,710
after Mr. Liang,

832
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,230
the responsibility is great and the road is long.

833
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,840
It is my honor.

834
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,320
Regarding the recent Wang Qiaosu case,

835
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:07,190
I have troubled you, Chief.

836
00:42:07,670 --> 00:42:08,400
As

837
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,230
the Director of Action Division 76,

838
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:11,440
I did not fulfill my duty.

839
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:14,670
I ask for your punishment, Chief.
