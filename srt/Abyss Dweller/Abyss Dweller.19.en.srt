1
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:00,840
Chief

2
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,040
The documents left behind by Chief Hirata

3
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:04,840
have all been gathered here.

4
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,920
I remember she had

5
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,240
a rather private office at headquarters.

6
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:11,000
I'm not too sure about that.

7
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:14,080
That's not your fault.

8
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,919
Hirata Kiko and her personal aide have both died.

9
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,599
If Director Mizuno hadn't told me,

10
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,719
I wouldn't have known either.

11
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,240
about this matter.

12
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,439
It's just too much of a coincidence.

13
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:26,800
None of Chief Hirata's close subordinates

14
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,199
survived.

15
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,840
This has put us at a disadvantage in the handover.

16
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:32,599
Maybe

17
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,599
this wasn't a coincidence at all.

18
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:41,800
Is it possible that

19
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:43,039
Hirata Kiko

20
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,199
has already discovered the whereabouts of the infiltrator

21
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:49,319
This infiltrator

22
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:51,599
when cornered

23
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,879
decided to risk everything in one move

24
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:56,599
The initial target of the anti-Japanese elements

25
00:02:56,599 --> 00:02:58,599
might not have been just Hirata Kiko

26
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,080
but rather to silence everyone who knew

27
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,599
eliminate all witnesses

28
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,280
That can't be

29
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,400
That's too difficult

30
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:09,159
We need bold speculation

31
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,400
to uncover the truth

32
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:14,560
Judging by her movements

33
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:16,560
after Hirata Kiko left Meihuatang

34
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,919
she went straight to the scene

35
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,960
What did she do before that

36
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:20,960
At Meihuatang

37
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,360
she attended the mobilization meeting called by Director Mizuno

38
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,319
And before that

39
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:27,960
Director Hirata had been staying at the army hospital

40
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:30,680
We already have the investigation report

41
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,520
She spent quite some time at the hospital

42
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,439
So, you mean

43
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,240
this matter

44
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,680
is connected to Director Hirata's death

45
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:43,439
Of course, this is just speculation

46
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,560
And speculation

47
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,919
needs to be verified

48
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,120
Sir

49
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,439
Meihuatang has already responded to us

50
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:54,240
All of Director Hirata's office items

51
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,719
will be delivered to us shortly

52
00:03:55,719 --> 00:03:56,199
Go

53
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:56,680
Yes, sir

54
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:57,960
Go with him

55
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:58,479
Yes, sir

56
00:04:27,319 --> 00:04:28,680
You've already seen it.

57
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,519
As long as he's still in this office,

58
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:31,920
he'll find out sooner or later.

59
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,199
Trouble just keeps coming.

60
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,399
Acting without considering the consequences

61
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,120
won't get you far here.

62
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:40,639
We have to find it before Takagi Yuyi does.

63
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:41,920
We need to locate Bone Maggot.

64
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:43,439
Otherwise, this will be

65
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:44,920
our last day here.

66
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,360
Chief.

67
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:03,120
We found this document among Chief Hirata's belongings.

68
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,399
We found this file.

69
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:14,399
A file.

70
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,839
A special backup was made.

71
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,399
This shows how much Hirata Kiko valued it.

72
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,040
This Bone Maggot

73
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,959
must know some important information.

74
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:22,800
Yes.

75
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,240
But we haven't found a way to contact him.

76
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,480
That's not important now.

77
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:27,399
Hirata Kiko

78
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,480
has dealt with this infiltrator

79
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,879
for a long time.

80
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:31,279
There are some things

81
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,399
they should fear more than we do.

82
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,639
And be more sensitive about.

83
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:36,639
What we need to do now

84
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,839
is use this file we have

85
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,560
to lure the infiltrator

86
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:43,199
into our trap.

87
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:43,879
Yes.

88
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:07,319
Sister Man

89
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,920
Did I wake you up?

90
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:11,639
No.

91
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,720
I'm just a little scared.

92
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:15,560
I wake up at the slightest sound.

93
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,720
Are you planning to leave now?

94
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:20,920
We've dealt with Cui Mo before.

95
00:06:21,879 --> 00:06:23,519
It's best to be cautious.

96
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,759
They've been watching for a whole day.

97
00:06:27,079 --> 00:06:28,720
Now they're in the fatigue period.

98
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,000
Even if Cui Mo has planted informants,

99
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,000
at this time,

100
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,720
their guard is at its lowest.

101
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,480
Also,

102
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,600
don't touch anything Cui Mo sends.

103
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,560
Okay.

104
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,519
Take care.

105
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:44,879
Take care.

106
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:52,720
Our boss has such a good relationship with Director Liang.

107
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,319
Why are we still being told to watch Miss Xie?

108
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,879
In our department,

109
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,160
even real brothers suspect each other.

110
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:01,879
Let alone those who aren't real brothers.

111
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:03,480
Just keep watching.

112
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:10,720
Miss Xie.

113
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,759
Miss Xie is sick.

114
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:14,920
She can't get up this early.

115
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,519
That's not Miss Xie.

116
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:17,920
She's taller than Miss Xie.

117
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,600
Qi Xiuquan.

118
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,160
Who lives in this rental place?

119
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,360
You've looked into it, right?

120
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,839
I'm asking you a question.

121
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:33,040
Seems like there's a woman in her forties living here.

122
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:33,839
Seems like.

123
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:34,879
Get up.

124
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,199
Let's go.

125
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:12,639
Miss.

126
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:13,879
Stop.

127
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,560
Hurry, after her!

128
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,160
Where is she?

129
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:33,639
She ran away.

130
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,399
Ran.

131
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:42,919
You can't even keep an eye on a woman.

132
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:43,879
Why don't you try?

133
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:45,559
If I had run any slower,

134
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:46,399
I would've lost my life.

135
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:47,080
You...

136
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:48,679
Two of our men are dead.

137
00:08:48,679 --> 00:08:50,240
You said you didn't see what the person looked like.

138
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,080
Can you guarantee Miss Xie's safety?

139
00:08:56,799 --> 00:08:57,679
Guarantee her safety?

140
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:58,960
No.

141
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:59,759
Director.

142
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:00,679
Doesn't this mean

143
00:09:00,679 --> 00:09:02,320
that Miss Xie is also suspicious?

144
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:07,639
What's suspicious about her?

145
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:08,799
Go ahead, tell me.

146
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:11,000
Just because anti-Japanese elements

147
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:12,159
passed by her residence,

148
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:13,039
she's suspicious?

149
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,120
So are you going to bring in everyone in the building

150
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,799
or even the whole neighborhood for questioning?

151
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,120
Why do I even keep you useless people around?

152
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,600
Director Cui.

153
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:23,960
The morning meeting is starting.

154
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:25,080
Alright.

155
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,320
I'll investigate this myself.

156
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:30,200
Get out.

157
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:31,919
Yes.

158
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:53,200
Liang Shuo's mind has been gone for a long time.

159
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:57,200
Liang Shuo can't remember anything anymore.

160
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:05,840
Hello, Director Liang.

161
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,720
Brother Cui, why are you quietly following behind me?

162
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,480
I'm not.

163
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,279
I didn't sleep well last night.

164
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,679
The regular meeting was moved up again.

165
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,120
I'm feeling a bit out of it.

166
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:20,759
You looking so listless

167
00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:21,919
is really rare.

168
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:24,799
You mentioned your wife and your younger siblings' wives,

169
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:26,080
aren't you all in the same boat?

170
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:26,840
One has a headache,

171
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:27,720
one has a stomach problem,

172
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:27,799
and another has a stomach problem.

173
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,480
These sudden illnesses in the middle of the night are the most exhausting.

174
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:34,879
You've had a tough time, Brother Cui.

175
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,279
It tormented me for half the night.

176
00:10:36,279 --> 00:10:37,919
She just said the medicine I bought didn't work.

177
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,120
I remember the stomach medicine your wife used before

178
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,600
was the one you helped buy.

179
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,279
It was that Western medicine.

180
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,159
What was it called again?

181
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:54,279
How long ago was that?

182
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:55,240
Not long ago.

183
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,879
It was before you went to Yulong Mountain.

184
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:05,600
That's right.

185
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,080
I remember now.

186
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:08,919
What was the name again?

187
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:09,759
It was called...

188
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,720
The name is a bit hard to pronounce.

189
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,879
I can't recall it right now.

190
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,120
How about this:

191
00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:17,679
I'll buy it and bring it to you.

192
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,679
Thanks for your trouble, brother.

193
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,320
The regular meeting was moved up.

194
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,759
Looks like headquarters has new arrangements.

195
00:11:30,279 --> 00:11:32,600
I'm afraid it has something to do with yesterday's meeting.

196
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,279
Seems like they're assigning new people.

197
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:38,759
If it's a blessing, it's not a curse.

198
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,639
If it's a curse, you can't avoid it.

199
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,879
It's about time.

200
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,039
Well then,

201
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:53,480
let's get started.

202
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,759
Let me introduce someone first.

203
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,799
This is

204
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:03,279
the person sent by the Military Police

205
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,519
to take over Chief Hirata's duties,

206
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:07,120
Chief Takagi.

207
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:11,600
Everyone, please take care of him.

208
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:16,559
Today's regular meeting was moved up.

209
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,000
I'm sure everyone

210
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,600
has already guessed the reason.

211
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:19,840
has already guessed the reason.

212
00:12:20,679 --> 00:12:23,080
Miss Hirata was near Dashui Bridge

213
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,320
when she was attacked by anti-Japanese elements

214
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,600
and unfortunately lost her life in the line of duty.

215
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:26,679
and unfortunately lost her life in the line of duty.

216
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:28,960
This incident

217
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,720
is being taken very seriously by our superiors.

218
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,960
The Special Affairs Committee also changed their schedule because of it.

219
00:12:34,279 --> 00:12:35,240
Last night,

220
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:35,759
they came to our Special...

221
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:36,480
Director Li,

222
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,480
no need to make it so complicated.

223
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,000
Alright.

224
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:45,200
Since Chief Takagi

225
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,600
has some insights to share,

226
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,879
I won't waste any more words.

227
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,279
Go ahead.

228
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,639
I called everyone here today

229
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,360
to inform you all

230
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,080
about the death of Ms. Hirata

231
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:01,679
that we already have some leads

232
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,039
and I believe we will have results soon

233
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,440
I also want to remind everyone

234
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:11,440
that my coming here to replace Ms. Hirata

235
00:13:12,039 --> 00:13:13,320
does not mean

236
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:16,200
that I approve of her previous work at headquarters

237
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,320
Her misfortune

238
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,080
to a large extent

239
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,360
was because of her

240
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,960
overly lenient attitude toward the rebels in the agency

241
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,879
and her excessive tolerance of them

242
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,399
I believe you will all soon understand

243
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,320
the biggest difference between her and me

244
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:43,519
What Mr. Takagi is implying

245
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,919
is that within the Special Operations Headquarters

246
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,960
there are still anti-Japanese elements.

247
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,159
There are still anti-Japanese elements.

248
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,879
Mr. Takagi,

249
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,679
after the Chen Gengsheng incident,

250
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,480
our entire headquarters

251
00:13:55,759 --> 00:13:57,240
has already been thoroughly screened.

252
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:57,320
We have already conducted a screening.

253
00:13:57,759 --> 00:13:59,279
For you to say this as a newcomer

254
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:02,360
is rather presumptuous, isn't it?

255
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,240
Whether it's presumptuous or not,

256
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,360
I don't need to explain myself to Director Cui.

257
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,519
All I can say is

258
00:14:08,679 --> 00:14:10,519
Hirata Kiko's surveillance network

259
00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:13,440
is even tighter than any of you imagine.

260
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:13,519
It's even more thorough than you think.

261
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:15,919
If there really is

262
00:14:15,919 --> 00:14:18,080
a problem within the Special Operations Headquarters,

263
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:20,600
I can verify it very soon.

264
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:23,120
The reason I'm saying all this

265
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,879
is because I still have basic trust

266
00:14:25,879 --> 00:14:27,279
in everyone present here.

267
00:14:27,799 --> 00:14:28,600
I hope

268
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:32,240
none of you will betray my trust.

269
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,279
Everyone,

270
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:38,679
does anyone else have something to say?

271
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:40,360
Old Zhou,

272
00:14:41,799 --> 00:14:42,480
Old Liu,

273
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:44,360
what about you?

274
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:45,600
Director,

275
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,519
well, I'm just

276
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:50,519
an administrative worker.

277
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:51,639
You're the director.

278
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:52,559
Whatever you say,

279
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:53,919
however you want things done,

280
00:14:54,279 --> 00:14:55,559
that's how we'll do it.

281
00:14:57,039 --> 00:14:58,600
If that's the case,

282
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,879
today's meeting

283
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,080
will end here.

284
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,480
Before ten o'clock this morning

285
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,559
I will give everyone an explanation

286
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:13,399
Give Director Li an explanation

287
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,879
What did Gao Mu say at the meeting?

288
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:45,519
He said before ten o'clock this morning

289
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:47,039
He would give everyone an explanation

290
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,080
What does that mean?

291
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,559
We can only speculate

292
00:15:49,559 --> 00:15:51,480
He has already found out the whereabouts of the bone maggot

293
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,480
The maggot only has a single line of contact.

294
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,840
Now that his superior is out of touch,

295
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,519
he should report directly to Mizuno.

296
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,480
There's no need to go through Takagi.

297
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:04,159
Mizuno went to Nanjing and hasn't returned.

298
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,759
I'm afraid this maggot couldn't wait any longer.

299
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:08,120
For us,

300
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,759
we can't afford to take any risks.

301
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:13,639
As long as we find him before Mizuno returns,

302
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:14,759
we still have a chance.

303
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,080
But we don't know

304
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,320
where they're meeting.

305
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:20,879
Just before the meeting,

306
00:16:21,919 --> 00:16:22,919
Takagi's adjutant

307
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:25,679
requested the vehicle records from General Affairs.

308
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,679
They're headed near the Xiaodong Gate.

309
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:30,720
The license plate number is

310
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,440
273.

311
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,360
Don't you find it strange?

312
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:37,480
Why didn't Takagi use a military police vehicle?

313
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,480
Maybe to avoid drawing attention.

314
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:40,600
To avoid drawing attention?

315
00:16:40,679 --> 00:16:42,679
Would he really leave such an obvious clue?

316
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,720
Xiaodong Gate is a chaotic area, easy to get in and out.

317
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,279
At the very least, he can retreat safely.

318
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:49,360
At the very least, he can retreat safely.

319
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,559
For Takagi,

320
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:53,399
finding the maggot is imperative.

321
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:54,799
He's eager to make a name for himself.

322
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,039
It's understandable.

323
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,840
It's better to be cautious.

324
00:16:58,840 --> 00:16:59,000
It's better to be cautious.

325
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,320
We're running out of time.

326
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,720
We can only hope

327
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:05,279
our guess is correct.

328
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,839
I'll find a way to inform Scorpio.

329
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,279
Have him cooperate with our operation.

330
00:17:08,279 --> 00:17:09,079
Alright.

331
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:31,720
Takagi is meeting guests at the East Gate.

332
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,119
Lure the enemy into a trap.

333
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,599
Eliminate the hidden Bone Maggots.

334
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:37,079
That is their top priority.

335
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,279
This "guest"

336
00:17:39,799 --> 00:17:41,519
naturally refers to the Bone Maggots.

337
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:43,960
"Lure the enemy into a trap"

338
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,440
is a double entendre.

339
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:47,680
It tells us this is a Hongmen Banquet,

340
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,039
and also implies a request for our support.

341
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:54,079
What do you all think?

342
00:17:55,799 --> 00:17:56,319
Teacher.

343
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:58,400
How about I take the guys to check it out?

344
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,160
I'm just afraid that...

345
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,640
They're monitoring Nian Ci's rental.

346
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,519
That means Cui Mo has already started to suspect Liang Shuo.

347
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,599
In this situation,

348
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:08,759
the risk is too high.

349
00:18:09,079 --> 00:18:09,799
That's right.

350
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,640
That's what I meant as well.

351
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,160
Even now,

352
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:15,440
there's still no news from No. 76.

353
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,039
In any case,

354
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,240
the other side has already made a move.

355
00:18:22,039 --> 00:18:23,720
We have no way out, we can only keep going.

356
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:23,799
We have no way out, we can only keep going.

357
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:26,359
If we can't get rid of Gu Yu,

358
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,000
we won't be able to protect Liang Shuo.

359
00:18:28,839 --> 00:18:30,240
If anything happens to Liang Shuo,

360
00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:32,839
we'll lose everything.

361
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,599
I understand.

362
00:18:36,039 --> 00:18:37,000
Mr. Takagi.

363
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:40,000
What you said in the meeting room,

364
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,680
was intentional, wasn't it?

365
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:45,200
Hirata Xizi.

366
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,920
She has her own methods

367
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,599
for controlling informants.

368
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,039
As for Gu Yu's whereabouts,

369
00:18:52,359 --> 00:18:54,160
I still have no clue.

370
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,359
However,

371
00:18:56,359 --> 00:18:57,279
since we have

372
00:18:57,279 --> 00:18:59,559
the advantage to attract the infiltrator,

373
00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:02,799
why not use him as bait?

374
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:05,960
How do we use him?

375
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,400
That's your problem.

376
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,359
But it seems like

377
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:10,839
from the very beginning,

378
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,640
you had all of us figured into your plan.

379
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,160
Director

380
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,559
Is it that you're not interested in the infiltrator

381
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,759
or do you simply not want to cooperate?

382
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,279
Yes.

383
00:19:27,559 --> 00:19:28,599
Simply

384
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:30,039
interested.

385
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,559
I will assign someone from the operations team

386
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,720
to assist Mr. Gao Mu's

387
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,160
capture plan.

388
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,000
I deeply appreciate your kindness.

389
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,279
Secretary Wang

390
00:19:50,519 --> 00:19:51,319
Chief

391
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:52,160
Go

392
00:19:52,839 --> 00:19:53,920
Have Cui Mo come here

393
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:54,720
Yes

394
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,000
The message has already been sent

395
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:59,160
Scorpio will provide us with support from the outside

396
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,440
This is just a routine assassination operation

397
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:02,279
Also

398
00:20:02,319 --> 00:20:03,000
It's me

399
00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:03,920
Not us

400
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:05,960
What do you mean?

401
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,359
Your identity is special

402
00:20:07,359 --> 00:20:08,400
They'll be watching you

403
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,039
You're not suitable to participate in this operation

404
00:20:10,119 --> 00:20:11,759
They're just suspicious, that's all

405
00:20:12,119 --> 00:20:12,920
Any suspicion

406
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,200
Doesn't come out of nowhere

407
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,440
And

408
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,920
I won't allow any accidents in this operation

409
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:19,960
Without me

410
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,599
The operations team won't cooperate with you

411
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:22,799
I don't need it

412
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,720
And you've overlooked something important

413
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:27,640
What?

414
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:30,240
Takagi is closely watching the agent headquarters right now

415
00:20:30,359 --> 00:20:31,680
Without a proper reason to go out

416
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,880
It's impossible to leave

417
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,599
Then what proper reason do you have?

418
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,200
I go to Meihua Hall every week

419
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,200
To report to Mizuno

420
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,680
And today happens to be the day

421
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,119
You've also overlooked something

422
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:43,599
What?

423
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,759
You have no right to decide what I do

424
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:49,880
What do you want to do?

425
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:49,920
What do you want to do?

426
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,880
Two tigers cannot share one mountain.

427
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:54,319
There must be priorities in what we do.

428
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,000
It's very simple.

429
00:20:57,079 --> 00:20:57,880
Guess heads or tails.

430
00:20:59,319 --> 00:20:59,880
The winner

431
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,440
has the right to make the decision.

432
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:15,680
The task

433
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:17,039
Do you understand?

434
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:18,160
Understood.

435
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,000
The map

436
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:34,359
About this operation,

437
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:35,680
what are your thoughts?

438
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:36,720
Feel free to speak frankly.

439
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:36,759
Feel free to speak frankly.

440
00:21:38,279 --> 00:21:40,400
Although Xiaodongmen is a bustling commercial area,

441
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,079
carrying out an assassination and escaping from there

442
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,359
is not very difficult.

443
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,599
Mr. Takagi's move

444
00:21:49,119 --> 00:21:50,680
is probably to make the infiltrator

445
00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:53,160
let down their guard.

446
00:21:55,559 --> 00:21:57,680
If you give a rabbit a safe environment,

447
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,640
it will come out to eat the carrot without worry.

448
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,440
Isn't that right?

449
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:04,119
The terrain of Xiaodongmen

450
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,640
also makes it easy to cover our own people.

451
00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:09,240
Although the environment is complicated,

452
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,680
as long as we station people at the north and south entrances,

453
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,799
we can control the whole situation.

454
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:15,880
Then,

455
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,440
the carrot

456
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:18,960
where should it be placed?

457
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,000
Here you go, sir.

458
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:07,680
Your noodles.

459
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,400
These noodles are so plain and watery.

460
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,440
How am I supposed to eat this?

461
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:14,559
Qi Xiuquan.

462
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,559
Are you here to do your job or just eat noodles?

463
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:18,359
The boss already said,

464
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,480
keep an eye on the surroundings.

465
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,119
Don’t just focus on eating noodles.

466
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,640
How are the arrangements going?

467
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:36,920
We brought a condemned prisoner from Plum Blossom Hall.

468
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:39,000
He's a die-hard Communist.

469
00:23:39,079 --> 00:23:40,200
He actually looks pretty clean.

470
00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:43,319
Bring him up.

471
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:57,240
Since you refuse to confess anything,

472
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:58,839
we’ll use you as bait.

473
00:23:58,839 --> 00:24:00,759
At least you’ll be of some use.

474
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:08,440
Get him some decent clothes.

475
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:09,359
Yes, sir.

476
00:24:17,079 --> 00:24:19,079
The intelligence headquarters is ready.

477
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,359
Your car is here.

478
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,559
At 9:30.

479
00:24:21,559 --> 00:24:22,799
They’ll depart from there on time.

480
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:39,160
This is the place.

481
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,160
Everyone, spread out.

482
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,759
Don’t make yourselves too obvious.

483
00:24:41,839 --> 00:24:42,640
Wait for my signal.

484
00:24:42,839 --> 00:24:43,640
Alright, alright.

485
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:45,759
Boss.

486
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:46,599
One bowl of noodles, please.

487
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:00,519
Hello, Director Liang.

488
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,680
Did you go to their dinner yesterday?

489
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:04,720
They ate.

490
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:05,680
Boss.

491
00:25:06,119 --> 00:25:07,000
Boss.

492
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,680
Where did all the people from the Intelligence Department go?

493
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,039
I don't know.

494
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,240
But I heard

495
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,440
Yan Tonghai and Li Guangzhi drank all night yesterday.

496
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,519
They probably haven't gotten up yet.

497
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:18,319
I heard

498
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:20,079
It seems there was an urgent task assigned from above.

499
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,000
What urgent task?

500
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,079
That I don't know.

501
00:25:24,279 --> 00:25:25,160
Should I go ask?

502
00:25:26,119 --> 00:25:26,920
No need.

503
00:25:28,519 --> 00:25:29,400
Today's newspaper.

504
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,720
Take a copy to Director Cui.

505
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,039
Got it.

506
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,440
Why did you come upstairs?

507
00:25:40,519 --> 00:25:41,640
To deliver the newspaper to Director Cui.

508
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,359
Wasn't it delivered this morning?

509
00:25:43,599 --> 00:25:44,319
This morning?

510
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,079
This is today's.

511
00:25:45,079 --> 00:25:45,759
He's not here right now.

512
00:25:45,759 --> 00:25:46,680
Just give it to me.

513
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:47,960
Alright, thanks for your hard work.

514
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:48,839
I'm going downstairs for a bit.

515
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,799
Move, move, move.

516
00:26:02,759 --> 00:26:04,599
Move, move.

517
00:26:05,119 --> 00:26:07,119
They're going to the area near Xiaodongmen.

518
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:08,400
The license plate number is

519
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:10,079
273.

520
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:15,599
Zhao Di.

521
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:16,359
Boss.

522
00:26:16,359 --> 00:26:17,359
Bring down my trench coat.

523
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:18,400
We're going to the pharmacy.

524
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,200
Okay.

525
00:26:21,759 --> 00:26:23,240
Before 10 a.m. today

526
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:25,079
I'll give everyone an explanation.

527
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,000
Boss

528
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Which pharmacy are we going to?

529
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,279
Turn right up ahead.

530
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,400
I remember near the East Gate,

531
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,839
there are several Western pharmacies.

532
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:45,759
Let's go check them out.

533
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:46,359
Okay.

534
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:58,599
Stop the car.

535
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,640
There are a few good Western pharmacies around here.

536
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,000
Go run an errand for me.

537
00:27:05,119 --> 00:27:05,839
Any

538
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:06,720
that can treat

539
00:27:06,839 --> 00:27:08,279
migraine with special medicine

540
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,759
buy them all for me.

541
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:11,160
Remember,

542
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:13,400
ask about each medicine's price, effects, and contraindications.

543
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,440
Make sure to ask clearly.

544
00:27:16,839 --> 00:27:17,640
Got it.

545
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,079
Go on.

546
00:27:18,079 --> 00:27:18,920
I'll wait for you here.

547
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:19,759
Alright, boss.

548
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,480
Seventh Brother

549
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,799
A Japanese vehicle has arrived.

550
00:28:47,319 --> 00:28:49,079
Are all the escape routes ready?

551
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,799
Scissors Alley behind the teahouse.

552
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:51,839
Go forward fifty meters.

553
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:52,599
Turn left.

554
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:53,759
Climb over the wall.

555
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,119
Someone will meet you then.

556
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,039
Tell the brothers.

557
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:57,960
No matter what,

558
00:28:58,079 --> 00:28:59,400
make sure to protect that person.

559
00:28:59,799 --> 00:29:01,079
Who is the person we need to cover?

560
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:02,920
Why hasn't he shown up yet?

561
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:03,720
Don't ask too much.

562
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:04,880
Keep a close watch.

563
00:29:06,319 --> 00:29:08,079
He'll show up when the time is right.

564
00:29:08,119 --> 00:29:08,960
Roger.

565
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:29,759
Stop eating.

566
00:29:40,599 --> 00:29:41,359
You two,

567
00:29:41,359 --> 00:29:42,440
go guard the alley entrance.

568
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,240
Director Liang

569
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:25,680
Why are you here?

570
00:30:27,599 --> 00:30:28,440
Cut the nonsense.

571
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,160
You two

572
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:29,839
come with me.

573
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,000
Director Liang

574
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,240
Director Liang

575
00:30:34,279 --> 00:30:35,079
Director Liang

576
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,480
We are here on orders

577
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,160
to stand guard.

578
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:38,680
That's right.

579
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,319
Director Cui told us not to leave our post.

580
00:30:40,759 --> 00:30:41,960
Don't you two know?

581
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,960
Director Cui reassigned you

582
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,599
to the southwest corner of Xiaodongmen Market.

583
00:30:45,599 --> 00:30:46,480
Hurry up and go.

584
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,039
Is Director Cui really waiting for us there?

585
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,039
Don't you know my relationship with Director Cui?

586
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:54,039
You don't know?

587
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:55,359
Are you doubting me?

588
00:30:58,960 --> 00:30:59,319
No.

589
00:30:59,319 --> 00:30:59,880
Let's go.

590
00:31:11,759 --> 00:31:12,440
Sir

591
00:31:15,119 --> 00:31:16,920
The net has been cast.

592
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,039
Xiaodongmen Teahouse

593
00:31:18,319 --> 00:31:19,839
Both sides have already met.

594
00:31:20,119 --> 00:31:21,720
Now we just wait for the infiltrator to take the bait.

595
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,680
No discoveries yet.

596
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,400
No unusual activity for now.

597
00:31:27,319 --> 00:31:30,759
But I have a feeling

598
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
the person we're looking for has already arrived.

599
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,920
Thank you, sir.

600
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,359
A bowl of noodles, please.

601
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:42,319
Okay.

602
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:52,839
It's an ambush.

603
00:32:52,839 --> 00:32:53,519
Hurry, go!

604
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,920
It's an ambush.

605
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,480
Move aside.

606
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,680
Move aside.

607
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:12,400
Move aside.

608
00:33:12,759 --> 00:33:13,480
Move aside.

609
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,160
Don't explain.

610
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,880
Who gave them permission to open fire on their own?

611
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:58,039
That communist suddenly resisted.

612
00:33:58,279 --> 00:34:00,000
That was truly unexpected.

613
00:34:04,039 --> 00:34:05,599
These are

614
00:34:06,839 --> 00:34:09,119
the soldiers you brought.

615
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:10,519
Are they all idiots?

616
00:34:10,519 --> 00:34:13,440
Block the roads! Block the roads!

617
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,719
Don't let a single one escape!

618
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:17,880
He definitely

619
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,039
hasn't gotten far yet.

620
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:23,880
I...

621
00:34:25,079 --> 00:34:25,920
Why are you here?

622
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,119
This is a trap set by Takagi Yuyi.

623
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:29,039
I told you long ago

624
00:34:29,039 --> 00:34:30,239
that things weren't that simple.

625
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,639
All the roads are blocked by the military police.

626
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:35,119
The agreed evacuation route is behind the teahouse.

627
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:36,000
Come with me.

628
00:34:38,039 --> 00:34:38,519
Sir.

629
00:34:38,519 --> 00:34:39,960
Two bodies were found at the scene.

630
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,119
They died from knife wounds.

631
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:49,360
He has accomplices.

632
00:34:56,599 --> 00:34:57,360
That side is blocked.

633
00:34:58,840 --> 00:34:59,519
Over there.

634
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,159
Director Cui.

635
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,079
The plan you initiated

636
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:15,440
has had no effect at all.

637
00:35:15,639 --> 00:35:16,760
All the infiltrators have already arrived,

638
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,159
yet someone still managed to escape.

639
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:22,000
Isn't it because of your mistake

640
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,360
that this happened?

641
00:35:29,039 --> 00:35:30,559
You couldn't even keep an eye on someone with their hands tied.

642
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,119
You couldn't even watch him.

643
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:41,760
Where is that communist?

644
00:35:51,519 --> 00:35:53,199
The Chongqing agents we captured

645
00:35:54,039 --> 00:35:55,840
are from a different faction than yours.

646
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:00,320
I truly think your decision isn't worth it.

647
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:04,199
In the face of personal and national hatred,

648
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,199
party disputes

649
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,400
are always just temporary.

650
00:36:08,639 --> 00:36:10,039
If we can drive out people like you—

651
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,440
invaders, devils—

652
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,800
and get rid of you all,

653
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:16,000
then this bit of physical suffering

654
00:36:16,119 --> 00:36:17,800
means nothing.

655
00:36:24,719 --> 00:36:25,519
Very well.

656
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,239
It's just a pity

657
00:36:34,599 --> 00:36:36,679
you'll never live to see that day.

658
00:36:58,960 --> 00:36:59,800
Director Cui,

659
00:37:00,519 --> 00:37:01,639
this matter isn't over yet.

660
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:05,760
Since the infiltrator and his accomplices have shown up,

661
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,719
they must have left some clues behind.

662
00:37:08,119 --> 00:37:08,920
I hope

663
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,719
that in our future work

664
00:37:10,719 --> 00:37:12,480
we can reach an understanding

665
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,800
and cooperate well.

666
00:37:16,599 --> 00:37:18,519
There's no need for Mr. Takagi to remind me of that.

667
00:37:19,199 --> 00:37:20,519
The ones who died were my men.

668
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,280
Of course I'll give it my all.

669
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:25,400
Director.

670
00:37:28,559 --> 00:37:29,079
Director.

671
00:37:29,079 --> 00:37:29,679
Speak.

672
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:32,079
We've lost two more men.

673
00:37:43,639 --> 00:37:44,199
Seventh Brother

674
00:37:45,559 --> 00:37:46,320
Seventh Brother

675
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:46,920
What is it?

676
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:47,840
We still haven't found them.

677
00:37:48,039 --> 00:37:48,880
Everyone got separated.

678
00:37:49,199 --> 00:37:49,920
Japanese military police

679
00:37:50,119 --> 00:37:51,280
It looks like they're chasing this way.

680
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:53,320
You go ahead.

681
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,239
I'll wait for them.

682
00:37:54,599 --> 00:37:55,199
Okay.

683
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:55,960
Seventh Brother

684
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,239
Isn't that them?

685
00:37:59,360 --> 00:37:59,760
Hurry!

686
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:00,559
Move!

687
00:38:00,719 --> 00:38:01,440
Let's go.

688
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,639
His Adam's apple was crushed.

689
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:20,760
Boss

690
00:38:21,079 --> 00:38:22,920
I clearly told them to guard the alley entrance.

691
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,000
How did they suddenly end up here?

692
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,719
It was done by someone they knew.

693
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,199
It must be that infiltrator.

694
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,559
He lured them here.

695
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,599
First, he succeeded in a sneak attack.

696
00:38:35,199 --> 00:38:37,320
Then killed the other one who discovered his plan.

697
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:39,960
Come.

698
00:38:40,159 --> 00:38:40,800
Look.

699
00:38:41,039 --> 00:38:42,519
This wound is unusual too.

700
00:38:46,159 --> 00:38:47,280
Go check the area nearby.

701
00:38:48,199 --> 00:38:49,199
See if there are any clues.

702
00:38:49,719 --> 00:38:50,679
Yes.

703
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:00,880
Climb over this wall and keep going straight.

704
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,360
Turn right, there are three rickshaws.

705
00:39:02,519 --> 00:39:03,440
Our people are in all of them.

706
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,400
Leave quickly.

707
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:05,679
Let's go.

708
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,320
You go ahead.

709
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,400
I'll go back by myself.

710
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,559
How do you plan to get away?

711
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:12,800
Worry about yourself.

712
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
I have my own way.

713
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:16,920
Go.

714
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:42,360
Hands up!

715
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:43,199
Sir!

716
00:39:43,199 --> 00:39:44,159
It's us, sir!

717
00:39:44,599 --> 00:39:45,360
Who is it?

718
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:45,920
Don't shoot!

719
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:46,639
It's us.

720
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:47,199
Sir!

721
00:39:47,199 --> 00:39:47,719
It's us.

722
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:48,079
Bastard!

723
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:48,800
It's us.

724
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:03,920
Boss

725
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,159
I didn't find anything here.

726
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,159
Boss

727
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,920
I didn't find anything here either.

728
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,159
Boss

729
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,840
I found a headquarters vehicle.

730
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:15,360
A headquarters vehicle?

731
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,119
Who sent it?

732
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,119
Not sure.

733
00:40:17,719 --> 00:40:18,840
It's surrounded by the Japanese.

734
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,400
Why is it here?

735
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,480
You come with me.

736
00:40:25,199 --> 00:40:26,320
I just don't believe it.

737
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,519
They're really one of us.

738
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:28,440
Sir

739
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:29,800
Boss

740
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:31,320
Didn't you tell them

741
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,679
that you're from the Special Operations Headquarters?

742
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:33,960
Boss, what are they chattering about?

743
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:34,760
I can't understand them.

744
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:35,760
And who are you?

745
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,559
These Japanese soldiers

746
00:40:39,559 --> 00:40:41,920
don't even recognize the Special Operations Headquarters license plate.

747
00:40:47,519 --> 00:40:48,320
Sorry.

748
00:40:50,719 --> 00:40:51,519
I'm very sorry.

749
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:53,239
Fall back.

750
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:53,880
Yes.

751
00:40:57,239 --> 00:40:57,719
Boss

752
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:58,880
Where did you just go?

753
00:40:59,519 --> 00:41:01,079
I went to a nearby pharmacy.

754
00:41:01,079 --> 00:41:01,719
Let's go.

755
00:41:01,719 --> 00:41:02,320
Let's head back.

756
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:03,840
Boss, I bought the medicine.

757
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:04,639
It's on the seat.

758
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,039
The tickets are ready too.

759

00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:55,519
What's wrong?
