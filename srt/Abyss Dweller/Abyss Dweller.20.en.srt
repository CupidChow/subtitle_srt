1
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,920
There are six brands of painkillers in total.

2
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:52,760
These two are inexpensive.

3
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:53,840
Their effectiveness is average.

4
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:56,640
They’re probably meant for ordinary people.

5
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:01,040
These two are very potent but have strong side effects.

6
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:02,400
Cui Mo’s wife has migraines.

7
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,879
They only started in recent years.

8
00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:05,760
She shouldn’t be using such strong medicine.

9
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:08,240
That leaves these two.

10
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:15,159
What’s wrong?

11
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:19,319
Director Cui.

12
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:33,639
Director Cui is on assignment nearby.

13
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,719
Brother.

14
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:36,879
Isn’t this a bit too much of a coincidence?

15
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:39,000
It really is quite a coincidence.

16
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:41,120
I was just handling something nearby.

17
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,599
Didn’t expect to run into you here.

18
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:45,199
What brings you here?

19
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,360
What’s the matter?

20
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:48,039
Is there a problem?

21
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,800
It’s nothing.

22
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,719
There was an incident over there.

23
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:55,759
Just a routine inquiry.

24
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:58,400
Come down.

25
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,639
Let’s talk.

26
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:10,919
This way, please.

27
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:24,120
No.

28
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,960
No, Brother Li.

29
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,479
We're all colleagues.

30
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:31,479
There's no need to make things so awkward.

31
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:32,960
Enough, stop trying to get close.

32
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:34,599
Today,

33
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,719
we're carrying out a mission with the military police.

34
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:37,719
Over by the East Gate,

35
00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:39,400
we just caught an anti-Japanese activist.

36
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:41,800
You caught an anti-Japanese activist—

37
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,199
what does that have to do with me?

38
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:44,719
I'm one of us.

39
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,039
We've checked.

40
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,120
It was one of our own who did it.

41
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:48,800
One of our own—

42
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,080
It was our own person who acted.

43
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,319
Enough with the nonsense.

44
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:52,000
Why are you here?

45
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,840
Explain it to me clearly, word for word.

46
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,960
Alright, hurry up and talk.

47
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:01,560
I went to buy medicine.

48
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:02,840
Medicine?

49
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:04,240
What kind of medicine?

50
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,360
Director Liang told me to.

51
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,520
Medicine for migraines.

52
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,639
He said

53
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:09,879
it was for Director Cui's wife.

54
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,960
The pharmacy closest to our headquarters

55
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:12,960
is right here at the East Gate.

56
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:15,280
So I came here.

57
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,240
Where's the medicine?

58
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,639
I gave it to Director Liang.

59
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:20,160
Brother Li, if you want to check,

60
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,639
go ask Director Liang yourself.

61
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:26,800
Did you go by yourself,

62
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,639
or did Director Liang go with you?

63
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,560
Zhao Di.

64
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,160
Come here.

65
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:38,040
Here.

66
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,639
You sent my man away right in front of me.

67
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,600
Looks like there are some things

68
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:48,959
you don't want me to hear.

69
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:50,240
No, Chief Liang,

70
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,920
we wouldn't dare trouble you.

71
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,720
We just went to buy medicine for your wife.

72
00:04:58,639 --> 00:04:59,399
Brother,

73
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,079
did you come here to help me buy medicine?

74
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:05,120
Zhao Di ratted me out.

75
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,439
No, boss,

76
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,040
that's not it at all.

77
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:09,160
Didn't I tell you?

78
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:10,360
It's just routine.

79
00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:13,240
Something really happened at the East Gate.

80
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:14,920
A group of anti-Japanese activists

81
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,480
killed several of our men.

82
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:17,920
The military police are arresting people right now.

83
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,040
Don't play games with me.

84
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:22,480
Let them arrest whoever they want.

85
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,000
Why are you bothering me?

86
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,319
Are you still suspicious of me?

87
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:27,680
Who's suspicious of you?

88
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:28,920
It's a joint operation.

89
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,480
Takagi Yuyi has been watching me closely.

90
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,519
How could I not do something?

91
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:36,160
Anything else?

92
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:38,439
You could've just sent him to buy the medicine.

93
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:39,920
Why did you come yourself?

94
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,040
If I sent him,

95
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:42,079
do you believe

96
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:43,800
he'd bring back the whole pharmacy for me?

97
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:45,160
You're right, boss.

98
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:50,720
Take a look.

99
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,680
Is this the one?

100
00:05:58,879 --> 00:05:59,399
Yes.

101
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,240
That's right.

102
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,360
Brother.

103
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:02,680
You were thoughtful.

104
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:04,720
As your older brother, I misunderstood you.

105
00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:07,439
Sister-in-law is truly a real sister-in-law.

106
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,319
Brother.

107
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:09,360
No.

108
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,839
Why are you being so petty?

109
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,560
Let's go.

110
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,279
Excuse me.

111
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:43,279
Just say what you want to say.

112
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:47,600
Boss, here's the situation.

113
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:50,079
Just now, Li Delun cornered me against the wall.

114
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,360
He asked me

115
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,199
when I was buying medicine,

116
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:53,839
if you went with me.

117
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,639
How did you answer?

118
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,879
Of course I said I went with you.

119
00:06:58,399 --> 00:06:59,040
Boss.

120
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:00,519
Even though I was transferred from the General Affairs Department,

121
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:02,040
I'm following you now.

122
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,360
I'm your man.

123
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,360
I know exactly what those people are thinking.

124
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,519
I know it all too well.

125
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,560
Brother Bai and Brother Yu have both told me.

126
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,399
That group from the Intelligence Department

127
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:11,399
those people

128
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,920
just love stirring things up behind the scenes.

129
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:13,959
Yes.

130
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,439
There's nothing wrong with catching anti-Japanese elements.

131
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,399
But you can't just bite whoever you catch.

132
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,759
If I didn't say it this way,

133
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,160
Then wouldn't they be like flies,

134
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,199
buzzing around you nonstop?

135
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:25,439
Zhao Di.

136
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,240
Boss.

137
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,160
I knew you were clever.

138
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,639
At critical moments,

139
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,279
you always keep a clear head.

140
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,839
It's thanks to your guidance, Boss.

141
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,399
By the way, Boss,

142
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,399
was there a problem with the medicine I bought?

143
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:40,000
I saw there was still quite a lot left.

144
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,240
The rest have too many side effects.

145
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:45,959
Like this one,

146
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:47,160
pregnant women can't use it.

147
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:49,120
Director Cui and his wife

148
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,759
haven't had a child all these years.

149
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,720
I almost caused trouble.

150
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,800
So Director Cui must be

151
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:57,600
pretty sensitive about this.

152
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,360
Yeah.

153
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:01,160
So,

154
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,160
be even more careful and smart.

155
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,319
Got it, Boss.

156
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,120
We're here.

157
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,879
Just now at the teahouse,

158
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:23,360
who was the one who gave the warning?

159
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:24,720
Why did they do that?

160
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,240
I'm not sure either.

161
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:28,000
But I heard

162
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:29,120
he's a Communist.

163
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:40,240
These two agents

164
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,679
were taken out at the chaotic scene.

165
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,159
That could be overlooked.

166
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,000
But as for the other two people,

167
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,320
it's obvious

168
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,960
that it was done by someone they knew.

169
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,679
Did no one else at the scene

170
00:08:50,679 --> 00:08:52,039
notice anything at all?

171
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:54,559
The situation is more complicated than we thought.

172
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:56,480
Our people, in such a short time,

173
00:08:56,559 --> 00:08:58,159
couldn't make thorough arrangements.

174
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,519
A lack of manpower

175
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,159
is certainly part of the reason.

176
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:03,399
But such a tiny wound

177
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,919
is quite rare.

178
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:07,000
I think

179
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,360
you should consider this angle

180
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,360
and think about it.

181
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,559
At our headquarters,

182
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:13,399
who exactly

183
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:15,960
has used a dagger of this shape?

184
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:21,159
Director Li

185
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:22,519
I think

186
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,440
this morning

187
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,360
all personnel who left the Special Agent Headquarters

188
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,159
should undergo a unified screening

189
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,120
I want to know

190
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,879
who is actually suspected of committing the crime

191
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,039
Mr. Takagi

192
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:34,200
The Peace Conference is just around the corner

193
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,720
There has been a lot of personnel going out

194
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,120
However

195
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,080
this can also serve as a

196
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,480
criterion for consideration

197
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:45,840
Secretary Wang

198
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:48,759
Director

199
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:49,960
Go

200
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,080
and get the head of General Affairs

201
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,159
Bring Director Liu here

202
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:54,440
Have him bring all the headquarters staff's

203
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:56,080
attendance, vehicle usage

204
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,799
and detailed leave records

205
00:09:57,799 --> 00:09:58,519
all over here

206
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:02,320
for Mr. Takagi

207
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,000
to review

208
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:06,240
Yes

209
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:12,200
Mr. Takagi

210
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,440
The Special Agent Headquarters staff's

211
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,120
attendance, vehicle usage

212
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,279
and leave records for the past two days

213
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:18,480
are all in here

214
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:20,840
Very good

215
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:22,159
You may leave

216
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,600
Do I need to repeat myself?

217
00:10:27,879 --> 00:10:28,399
Yes

218
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:39,919
Mr. Takagi

219
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:41,200
Just based on this

220
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:43,080
can you figure anything out?

221
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,840
As long as you pay attention,

222
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,279
of course you can find something.

223
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:50,480
Then, Mr. Takagi,

224
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,519
please give us your guidance.

225
00:10:52,279 --> 00:10:54,240
These materials seem complicated,

226
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,080
but actually,

227
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,840
most people can be ruled out.

228
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,320
At the crime scene, you also saw

229
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:02,759
that the two No. 76 agents

230
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:04,159
were killed by someone they knew.

231
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:06,159
Think about it:

232
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,720
what kind of person

233
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:09,159
could make two

234
00:11:09,159 --> 00:11:11,440
agents already on duty

235
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,200
leave their posts

236
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,200
and go somewhere else?

237
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:18,279
Someone they are familiar with

238
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:23,360
or

239
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,720
someone they have to obey.

240
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,000
That explains it well.

241
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,279
Among those who left this morning,

242
00:11:34,759 --> 00:11:36,720
who holds a position

243
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:39,159
that these two had to obey?

244
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,000
And who are their familiar friends?

245
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:45,879
In this way,

246
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,600
at least two-thirds of the people

247
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,039
can be ruled out.

248
00:11:50,039 --> 00:11:52,240
The remaining section chiefs

249
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,080
and the director

250
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,679
are more suspicious, aren't they?

251
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,600
That's enough.

252
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:30,279
The director is back.

253
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:31,399
Director.

254
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,000
Mr. Takagi asked you to go to the inquiry office.

255
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,000
The inquiry office?

256
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:35,559
Yes.

257
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,519
Didn't say what it was about.

258
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,399
No.

259
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:40,120
Many section chiefs and directors have already gone.

260
00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:42,000
I really don't know the specifics.

261
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,240
I was told to wait here for you.

262
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,080
Got it.

263
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,759
How did Takagi find these people?

264
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:07,519
These are all people who left headquarters this morning.

265
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:08,600
Field staff.

266
00:13:09,559 --> 00:13:11,120
They're being questioned together.

267
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:12,879
This only means

268
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:15,279
Takagi Yuyi still hasn't found a clear target.

269
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:18,080
That means

270
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,200
this maggot

271
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,639
is still threatening us from the shadows.

272
00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:23,480
Did you notice anything?

273
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,480
What's really going on today?

274
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,759
They're going to interrogate us.

275
00:13:30,759 --> 00:13:31,519
Chief Wang.

276
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,159
Please.

277
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,039
Why should I have to be questioned?

278
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,960
We've done so much work.

279
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,000
Director Li has seen it all.

280
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:38,440
Right?

281
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:38,799
That's right.

282
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:40,240
I want to appeal to Director Li.

283
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:41,759
I want to appeal to Chief Mizuno.

284
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:42,440
Chief Wang.

285
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:42,919
Please.

286
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,120
Get out of the way.

287
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,240
Director Liang.

288
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,039
Look at this...

289
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,000
What on earth is going on?

290
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,679
Before this,

291
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,360
where did you go?

292
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:07,240
I was just running errands for Director Li.

293
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,600
Aside from work-related tasks,

294
00:14:08,679 --> 00:14:10,080
I didn't go anywhere else.

295
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:11,919
Is that so?

296
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,360
As far as I know,

297
00:14:13,559 --> 00:14:15,960
it takes less than thirty minutes on foot

298
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,399
from the Special Operations Headquarters to your destination.

299
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:20,559
You left at eight o'clock

300
00:14:20,919 --> 00:14:23,559
and didn't return until 11:02.

301
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,039
About this,

302
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,919
don't you want to explain?

303
00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:28,440
I...

304
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,320
You don't need to worry.

305
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,679
I can understand

306
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,360
that outside of work,

307
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:36,000
you might take care of some personal matters.

308
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,799
But you must find

309
00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:40,320
someone who can confirm where you went.

310
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,399
Otherwise,

311
00:14:42,759 --> 00:14:45,320
I will charge you with treason.

312
00:14:46,039 --> 00:14:47,039
Do you understand?

313
00:14:47,559 --> 00:14:48,200
Understood.

314
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:53,720
Alright.

315
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:54,840
Take him out.

316
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:02,080
I've already explained everything I needed to.

317
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,039
Mr. Takagi, do you have any other questions?

318
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:07,799
With Director Cui as your witness,

319
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,679
there shouldn't be any issues, of course.

320
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,200
But I still want to remind Director Liang

321
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:14,919
to pay more attention to the people around you.

322
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,120
The people around me?

323
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,120
If this is just your speculation, Chief Takagi,

324
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,720
then let's just drop it.

325
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,840
I also want to catch the infiltrator as soon as possible.

326
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:27,000
That way, I can devote more energy

327
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,759
to my unfinished work

328
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:31,320
instead of sitting here making small talk.

329
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:36,600
Damn it.

330
00:15:46,039 --> 00:15:47,240
Basically, everyone

331
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,080
has a legitimate reason.

332
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:50,159
Mr. Takagi,

333
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,960
the direction of our investigation

334
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,559
might have some issues.

335
00:15:54,279 --> 00:15:57,200
Problems are always found in the details.

336
00:15:58,960 --> 00:15:59,919
No need to rush.

337
00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:02,039
We will definitely find something.

338
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:03,879
The main issue is time.

339
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,000
The Peace Conference delegates

340
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,159
will soon be heading to Shanghai.

341
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,200
If we try to root out anti-Japanese elements at this time,

342
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,080
I'm afraid we won't find anyone

343
00:16:11,559 --> 00:16:13,120
before the Peace Conference has already started.

344
00:16:17,799 --> 00:16:18,639
I heard

345
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:21,519
Director Cui and Director Liang are quite close personally.

346
00:16:21,799 --> 00:16:22,600
Not really.

347
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:24,320
We've just known each other for a long time.

348
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:28,080
Hirata Noriko investigated him before.

349
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:29,919
That was just a misunderstanding.

350
00:16:30,879 --> 00:16:32,120
Before Hirata had her incident,

351
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,159
Liang Shuo started dating a new girlfriend.

352
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,159
Yes.

353
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,559
I even monitored her.

354
00:16:36,679 --> 00:16:37,639
But later on,

355
00:16:37,639 --> 00:16:38,679
she was cleared of suspicion.

356
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:43,440
Director Cui,

357
00:16:44,039 --> 00:16:45,279
being thorough is a good thing.

358
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:46,639
It's commendable.

359
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,360
But I suggest

360
00:16:48,519 --> 00:16:49,759
keeping work and personal matters separate.

361
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:50,919
Personal matters

362
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:51,960
should be handled privately.

363
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:54,080
Mr. Takagi,

364
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,679
is that really necessary?

365
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,679
That depends on how you see it.

366
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:01,600
Please,

367
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,519
come in.

368
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,240
Cui, what brings you here today?

369
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,759
It's really busy.

370
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,200
Busy, busy.

371
00:17:36,039 --> 00:17:37,400
Both annoying and busy.

372
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:38,720
Look here.

373
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:41,200
Coordinating accommodations for the new government delegates.

374
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,839
Security patrol routes.

375
00:17:44,319 --> 00:17:46,599
Managing and controlling the surrounding traffic.

376
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:47,680
And this, too.

377
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:48,640
The hardest part is

378
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:50,319
the household registration investigation.

379
00:17:50,599 --> 00:17:51,880
All the tenants in the area

380
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,519
have to be cleared out.

381
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,119
The team assigned to me

382
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:56,559
is just two police stations.

383
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:59,599
You can't make a meal without rice.

384
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:01,079
I'm about ready to give up.

385
00:18:01,759 --> 00:18:03,200
And then there's Takagi from the military police.

386
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,200
He keeps coming to cause me trouble.

387
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:07,559
It was never this big of a deal before.

388
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,839
Looks like this time

389
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,400
they really mean business.

390
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:12,319
You said that was before.

391
00:18:16,599 --> 00:18:17,400
Brother Cui,

392
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,680
if you really want to see,

393
00:18:18,839 --> 00:18:19,799
I'll show you.

394
00:18:20,119 --> 00:18:22,000
I've been looking for someone to take the blame for me.

395
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,440
That was a great reminder.

396
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,319
I almost forgot.

397
00:18:29,319 --> 00:18:31,440
You're now Director Liang of the Special Investigation Department.

398
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,039
If I look at your department's files,

399
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:34,000
that would be a breach of protocol.

400
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,119
You'd better put them away quickly.

401
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,279
Yeah.

402
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,119
In our line of work,

403
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,799
the more you know, the more trouble you get into.

404
00:18:42,279 --> 00:18:43,160
You came at just the right time.

405
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,240
Saves me the trouble of looking for you.

406
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,160
Director Liang.

407
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,400
Do you have any instructions?

408
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:49,640
Stop joking around.

409
00:18:52,759 --> 00:18:55,000
Someone from the Special Committee just called.

410
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,440
They asked about the Xiaodongmen incident.

411
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,359
Any leads yet?

412
00:18:57,359 --> 00:18:58,400
It's not that fast.

413
00:18:58,599 --> 00:18:59,640
It's only been a day.

414
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,880
I'm not some kind of super detective.

415
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,200
Also,

416
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:03,480
Since when does the Special Committee

417
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,200
get involved in such minor matters?

418
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,720
It's not exactly a minor matter.

419
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,960
Nanjing takes this very seriously.

420
00:19:11,839 --> 00:19:12,759
You know,

421
00:19:13,359 --> 00:19:14,440
those officials

422
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,799
have long been scared

423
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,079
by the Communists and the Chongqing faction.

424
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,720
They're terrified.

425
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,079
The higher-ups just say a word,

426
00:19:22,759 --> 00:19:24,119
and the people below run themselves ragged.

427
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,640
I don't see you running yourself ragged.

428
00:19:27,839 --> 00:19:28,720
You still have the leisure

429
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,079
to come chat with me.

430
00:19:30,359 --> 00:19:32,440
Can't I come see you for personal reasons?

431
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:33,599
Personal reasons?

432
00:19:34,359 --> 00:19:35,359
Your sister-in-law asked me

433
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:36,480
to check on Miss Xie's health.

434
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,359
How is her recovery going?

435
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:38,279
If she's better,

436
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:39,160
let's find a time

437
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,400
to have a meal at home.

438
00:19:41,279 --> 00:19:42,079
That's all?

439
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,359
What do you mean, "that's all"?

440
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,440
Why "that's all"?

441
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,680
This is an order from our family's highest authority.

442
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,799
It's a direct instruction.

443
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,240
You must have time for a family meal.

444
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,000
Surely you can spare that.

445
00:19:50,759 --> 00:19:52,039
Please, give me a break.

446
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,079
Can't you see

447
00:19:53,079 --> 00:19:54,680
I've got a mess to deal with here?

448
00:19:54,839 --> 00:19:55,759
That's not my concern.

449
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,960
I'm just passing on the order.

450
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:58,960
So, what do you say?

451
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:03,680
Alright.

452
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:04,799
When?

453
00:20:04,839 --> 00:20:05,720
Tonight.

454
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:06,559
It's settled, then.

455
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:33,839
You startled me.

456
00:20:34,119 --> 00:20:35,559
I thought I got on the wrong car.

457
00:20:36,359 --> 00:20:37,400
Did I scare you?

458
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,079
You look different from usual.

459
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:47,720
Do I look good?

460
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,039
Not bad.

461
00:20:52,519 --> 00:20:53,400
Not bad.

462
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,680
I thought since today is Director Cui's family dinner,

463
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:58,200
you shouldn't feel too restrained.

464
00:20:58,519 --> 00:20:59,720
Just relax a bit.

465
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:10,000
Leave it to Feiman.

466
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:11,920
Are you free in the next few days?

467
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,000
Let's go watch a movie together.

468
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:16,480
Are there any good movies lately?

469
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:17,799
Zhao Di.

470
00:21:18,039 --> 00:21:19,240
Any good movies recently?

471
00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:20,519
Mulan Joins the Army.

472
00:21:20,599 --> 00:21:22,079
Miss Chen Yunshang's new film.

473
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,519
I heard it's pretty good.

474
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
There's also that one that was released earlier,

475
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:26,680
the romantic tragedy.

476
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,359
The Beautiful Lady Yu.

477
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:28,119
It's been re-released recently.

478
00:21:29,559 --> 00:21:30,519
Then,

479
00:21:31,079 --> 00:21:32,119
let's watch Mulan Joins the Army.

480
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:33,720
I'm not going.

481
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,279
Why?

482
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,599
It's a last-minute invitation.

483
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:37,839
You're really not sincere.

484
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,519
You finally made it.

485
00:22:06,079 --> 00:22:06,880
Brother Cui.

486
00:22:07,839 --> 00:22:08,279
Come on in.

487
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:09,920
Big Brother Cui.

488
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:10,599
Sister-in-law.

489
00:22:10,599 --> 00:22:11,319
Welcome.

490
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,559
How is your recovery going?

491
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:14,759
Thank you for your concern, Big Brother Cui.

492
00:22:14,759 --> 00:22:15,599
Much better.

493
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,640
The illness came quickly but went away just as fast.

494
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:18,960
You need to take care and recuperate.

495
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:19,920
You can't let it relapse.

496
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:21,640
By the way,

497
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:23,000
since I'm coming to your house,

498
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
I brought a gift for you and your wife.

499
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:25,839
Director Cui,

500
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,880
ever since you got married,

501
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,200
you've really become thoughtful.

502
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:30,960
When you used to come to my house before,

503
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,400
you wouldn't even bring a single peanut.

504
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,200
Where's your wife?

505
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,480
She's in the kitchen.

506
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,440
She knew you were coming,

507
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,279
and nagged me all day.

508
00:22:37,279 --> 00:22:38,079
It drove me crazy.

509
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,720
Your wife is cooking herself?

510
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:40,920
Then I have to go order some dishes.

511
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:41,359
Let's go.

512
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,799
What's going on?

513
00:22:43,799 --> 00:22:45,720
Your collar is all messed up, one side in front and one in back.

514
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,599
You should pay more attention.

515
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:47,319
Sister-in-law,

516
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,160
you can't be too nice to him.

517
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,519
You'll spoil him.

518
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:51,960
Let's go.

519
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:52,440
Please.

520
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,359
Sir, you're back.

521
00:22:58,559 --> 00:22:59,880
Hello, Mr. Liang, hello.

522
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:00,599
Hello.

523
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:02,319
Sister-in-law, we're here.

524
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:03,359
Hello, Miss.

525
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:04,799
You're already here.

526
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:06,759
I thought you wouldn't arrive so soon.

527
00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:08,319
Thank you.

528
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,160
This must be Miss Xie.

529
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:10,920
Sir.

530
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:11,759
Hello.

531
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,519
I've introduced you to so many well-known ladies.

532
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:16,160
How come you didn't like any of them?

533
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,200
Now I finally understand.

534
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,240
Miss Xie is really beautiful.

535
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,640
Our Liang Shuo is truly lucky.

536
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,240
Sister-in-law, you're too kind.

537
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:26,759
Come, tell me quickly.

538
00:23:26,759 --> 00:23:27,960
How did you two meet?

539
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:31,400
The kitchen is a woman's place.

540
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,359
Why are you joining in?

541
00:23:32,359 --> 00:23:32,680
Come.

542
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,359
Sit over here.

543
00:23:34,519 --> 00:23:36,759
I can tell sister-in-law is really happy today.

544
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:37,960
During this time,

545
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,640
you probably haven't spent much time with her.

546
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:45,640
Actually, we're all the same.

547
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,200
Sometimes,

548
00:23:47,839 --> 00:23:49,440
we don't even know what we're doing.

549
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,359
Cat's way, dog's way,

550
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:55,200
as long as we survive, it's a good way.

551
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,680
I remember Brother Cui said that, right?

552
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:00,920
People like us,

553
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,119
wearing this dog's skin,

554
00:24:02,119 --> 00:24:03,160
what is it all for?

555
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,000
Isn't it just for

556
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
letting our families have a good life?

557
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:10,400
Brother Cui, let me tell you,

558
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:11,960
this Xiao Xie,

559
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:13,759
I really like her.

560
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:20,599
I knew you were coming.

561
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,640
Your sister-in-law has been busy from morning till night.

562
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,880
Alright, time to eat.

563
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:28,240
I made a lot of local dishes.

564
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,319
That's amazing.

565
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,640
Thank you for your hard work, sister-in-law.

566
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,799
How come you never say I work hard?

567
00:24:35,079 --> 00:24:36,240
You worked hard too.

568
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,880
We're the worst for just coming to eat for free.

569
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,480
That's true.

570
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,000
Sister-in-law, I really like your personality.

571
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:44,680
You're witty, humorous, lively, and adorable.

572
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:46,599
It's been a long time since I cooked.

573
00:24:46,599 --> 00:24:48,799
We also have to thank Miss for helping out as a guest.

574
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,279
I really feel embarrassed.

575
00:24:50,319 --> 00:24:51,519
It's nothing, sister-in-law.

576
00:24:51,519 --> 00:24:52,920
When I'm at home,

577
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,359
I also make some simple dishes.

578
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:56,920
It's already seven o'clock.

579
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:57,799
Everyone must be hungry.

580
00:24:57,799 --> 00:24:58,640
Sit down, sit down, sit down.

581
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,400
Let's eat.

582
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,240
We're just waiting for sister-in-law to sit down first.

583
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,039
No way.

584
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:04,119
You can't sit here.

585
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:04,720
That's the seat of honor.

586
00:25:05,319 --> 00:25:05,920
I can't.

587
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,039
How can the main seat be left for me?

588
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:07,720
I don't dare to sit there.

589
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,000
We're all family here.

590
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,279
And we're at our own home.

591
00:25:10,279 --> 00:25:11,400
At our home,

592
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,599
you're the most important.

593
00:25:12,599 --> 00:25:13,200
Come on.

594
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,960
Such a smooth talker.

595
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,200
Sit, sit, sit.

596
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,240
It's Xiao Xie's first time visiting.

597
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,559
Sorry to let you see us like this.

598
00:25:24,599 --> 00:25:25,599
Don't worry, sister-in-law.

599
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,640
Yuxin is also an independent woman.

600
00:25:27,799 --> 00:25:29,720
She values gender equality the most.

601
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:31,200
Gender equality.

602
00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:34,039
Then your days ahead won't be easy.

603
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:35,880
Are your days tough?

604
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,039
I wouldn't dare.

605
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,359
We're actually enjoying it.

606
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,880
Yes, yes, enjoying it.

607
00:25:41,359 --> 00:25:41,759
Come on.

608
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,240
Let's welcome our brother.

609
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:43,960
And welcome our sister-in-law.

610
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:44,880
To our home as guests.

611
00:25:45,319 --> 00:25:45,799
Cheers!

612
00:25:51,799 --> 00:25:52,599
Eat, eat.

613
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,759
Try my wife's cooking.

614
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:56,359
Here.

615
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:03,799
Sister-in-law.

616
00:26:04,519 --> 00:26:05,519
I just heard you say

617
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,839
that you also like to cook.

618
00:26:08,039 --> 00:26:09,480
You enjoy making small dishes.

619
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,240
But you can't seem to get them right.

620
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,920
They always turn out a mess.

621
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,240
Usually,

622
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,519
what kind of dishes do you like to make?

623
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,640
Oh right, sister-in-law,

624
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:20,079
I heard last time you woke up at night with a headache.

625
00:26:20,359 --> 00:26:21,480
The medicine I bought for you,

626
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:23,119
I wonder if it worked.

627
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,680
My head hurts.

628
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:31,519
It'll just take a day or two.

629
00:26:31,519 --> 00:26:32,519
She'll be fine soon.

630
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,400
This is an old problem of hers.

631
00:26:34,599 --> 00:26:35,680
It comes and goes.

632
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:38,920
Judging by Miss Xie's accent,

633
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,319
you're from the south, right?

634
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,359
That's right, sister-in-law.

635
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,480
I'm from Wuxi.

636
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,119
Wuxi is a nice place too.

637
00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:45,599
Sister-in-law,

638
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:47,880
why did you come to Shanghai?

639
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,279
Alright,

640
00:26:50,599 --> 00:26:51,680
don't act like

641
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,400
you're interrogating her about her background.

642
00:26:55,079 --> 00:26:56,640
It's just a habit from my job.

643
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,039
Whenever I see someone,

644
00:26:58,039 --> 00:26:59,039
I want to ask a few questions.

645
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,599
Sister-in-law, please don't mind.

646
00:27:02,599 --> 00:27:03,559
Old Cui,

647
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,119
what are you doing?

648
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,599
Just making small talk.

649
00:27:07,119 --> 00:27:07,920
Brother Cui,

650
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:08,799
you know as well,

651
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,920
right now, both north and south of the Yangtze are in chaos.

652
00:27:11,119 --> 00:27:13,400
There are refugees everywhere, forced to leave their homes.

653
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:14,960
Sister-in-law,

654
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:16,960
is that why

655
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,079
you came to Shanghai?

656
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:19,359
Yes.

657
00:27:22,359 --> 00:27:23,480
These are troubled times.

658
00:27:24,039 --> 00:27:25,359
It's always the common people who suffer.

659
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,480
We're all family here.

660
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:28,519
Sister-in-law,

661
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,759
is it convenient for you

662
00:27:29,759 --> 00:27:30,559
to tell us more specifically?

663
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,519
Brother Cui,

664
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,680
I'm reopening old wounds.

665
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,720
It's nothing.

666
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:41,519
My parents both passed away because of these things.

667
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,480
Old Cui,

668
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,240
Why bring up the most painful topic?

669
00:27:45,319 --> 00:27:47,119
We're just here to eat, aren't we?

670
00:27:49,359 --> 00:27:51,480
The Nanjing government has now secured Shanghai.

671
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:52,680
Next,

672
00:27:52,759 --> 00:27:55,240
there will be a unified government established in both the south and north of the Yangtze.

673
00:27:55,519 --> 00:27:56,720
Once the bandits are eliminated,

674
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,279
sister-in-law's journey home will be smooth and unhindered.

675
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:02,559
Then you'll be able to reunite with your family.

676
00:28:03,759 --> 00:28:05,480
Brother Cui's vision is beautiful,

677
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,400
but I'm not that optimistic.

678
00:28:08,079 --> 00:28:09,319
That doesn't surprise me at all.

679
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,559
You've always been a pessimist.

680
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,119
I'm a realist.

681
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,359
Brother Cui,

682
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,319
people can live in their own world,

683
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,759
but being too stubborn

684
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:18,720
isn't good.

685
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:21,920
Alright, alright,

686
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:21,960
let's not talk about this anymore.

687
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,279
Let's not talk about this anymore.

688
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:23,839
Come on,

689
00:28:23,839 --> 00:28:25,359
try sister-in-law's cooking.

690
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:26,920
She's been busy for half the day.

691
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,200
Yuxin,

692
00:28:28,599 --> 00:28:29,440
thank you, sister-in-law.

693
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,079
Is the food to your liking?

694
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:37,519
You're not having trouble getting used to it, are you?

695
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,839
Sister-in-law, your cooking looks, smells, and tastes amazing.

696
00:28:39,839 --> 00:28:41,039
How could I not like it?

697
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:41,799
It's delicious.

698
00:28:43,759 --> 00:28:45,000
Do people from Wuxi eat Shanghai cuisine

699
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,480
Are you used to it

700
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,279
They're pretty similar

701
00:28:49,359 --> 00:28:50,160
It reminds me

702
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,920
The first time I went to Wuxi with Lao Cui

703
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,200
We ate the soup dumplings there

704
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:54,839
They were so sweet

705
00:28:54,839 --> 00:28:56,319
It was like they were dipped in honey

706
00:28:56,519 --> 00:28:57,640
At the time, I even complained

707
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:00,079
Did the owner mistake sugar for salt

708
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,240
Yes

709
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:04,559
Our Wuxi soup dumplings are sweet

710
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:05,839
I grew up there

711
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:06,680
Before I came to Shanghai

712
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,319
I thought all soup dumplings in the world

713
00:29:08,319 --> 00:29:09,680
were supposed to be sweet

714
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,240
If you want to eat anything in the future

715
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,480
just let me know

716
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:14,160
I'll have someone make it for you, okay

717
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:15,319
Thank you, sister-in-law

718
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,519
I won't trouble you

719
00:29:17,119 --> 00:29:18,480
People are scattered all over

720
00:29:18,599 --> 00:29:20,079
We stopped being so particular long ago

721
00:29:20,359 --> 00:29:21,759
Being able to live like this now

722
00:29:21,759 --> 00:29:22,440
with no worries about food or clothing

723
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,640
I'm already very content

724
00:29:25,079 --> 00:29:26,599
What a wonderful girl

725
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,640
You better not bully her

726
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,440
I'm putting my words here

727
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,559
How would I dare

728
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,160
It's all about gender equality now

729
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,599
Who bullies whom in the future

730
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:36,720
is still uncertain

731
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:37,880
Nonsense

732
00:29:39,079 --> 00:29:39,720
Sister-in-law

733
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,599
I heard you're studying

734
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,079
and working at a clothing store at the same time

735
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,839
That's not a long-term solution

736
00:29:46,839 --> 00:29:48,000
Now that you're in Shanghai

737
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,279
what are your plans for the future

738
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,359
I haven't thought about that.

739
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,920
It depends on what he plans to do.

740
00:30:00,079 --> 00:30:01,960
That's also why I came to see you today.

741
00:30:03,319 --> 00:30:04,359
Since you're planning to start a family,

742
00:30:04,599 --> 00:30:05,559
you need stability.

743
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:08,599
Your sister-in-law is raising funds to open a jewelry store.

744
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,599
The target customers are fashionable young women in Shanghai.

745
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:14,119
I've looked into it.

746
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,759
You help out at a clothing store.

747
00:30:16,039 --> 00:30:17,200
You probably don't make much money there.

748
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:19,720
My shop is newly opened.

749
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,920
I don't have any experience either.

750
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:21,880
I've heard

751
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:24,160
Miss Xie also comes from a well-off family.

752
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,359
She's seen the world.

753
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,079
She also has experience serving customers.

754
00:30:28,519 --> 00:30:30,200
She's gracious and well-mannered.

755
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:31,359
I was thinking

756
00:30:31,599 --> 00:30:33,720
of inviting Miss Xie to run the business with me.

757
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:35,960
Sister-in-law,

758
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:36,759
I can't do it.

759
00:30:36,759 --> 00:30:38,039
Why not?

760
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,279
You're educated.

761
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:40,640
You're a modern woman.

762
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,319
You're knowledgeable and fashionable.

763
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:44,359
And with you supporting your sister-in-law,

764
00:30:44,359 --> 00:30:45,279
I'd feel at ease.

765
00:30:45,599 --> 00:30:46,440
I think

766
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,519
you shouldn't turn it down.

767
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:48,720
Brother,

768
00:30:50,519 --> 00:30:51,359
what do you think?

769
00:30:54,599 --> 00:30:56,960
I can't make the decision on this.

770
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,839
Let's see if Yuxin has other plans.

771
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:07,880
If it's really difficult for you,

772
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,160
it's okay.

773
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,440
We won't force you to do anything.

774
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:13,640
That's true.

775
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,119
I really do

776
00:31:15,119 --> 00:31:16,680
want to learn from you.

777
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:17,960
But I'm a bit slow.

778
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,359
You'll have to teach me more.

779
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,880
That would be wonderful.

780
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,359
I think so too.

781
00:31:23,559 --> 00:31:24,079
Come on.

782
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,759
Congratulations on joining us.

783
00:31:26,119 --> 00:31:26,720
Cheers.

784
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:27,920
Thank you.

785
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:38,160
The two sisters,

786
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:38,640
have endless things to talk about.

787
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,039
You're the one who worked hard.

788
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,039
Brother Cui, sister-in-law.

789
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,240
No need to see us off.

790
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,160
Hurry and head back.

791
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:45,680
Thank you for your hospitality today.

792
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,400
Time really flies.

793
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,160
I really wish you could stay longer.

794
00:31:50,079 --> 00:31:51,720
Sister-in-law, if you have time in the future,

795
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,079
I'll come visit you often.

796
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,640
That would be wonderful.

797
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:56,720
Sister-in-law doesn't mind being disturbed,

798
00:31:56,839 --> 00:31:58,359
but I rarely have free time.

799
00:31:58,680 --> 00:31:59,839
Brother Cui knows that.

800
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:01,720
Aren't you impressive.

801
00:32:02,359 --> 00:32:03,440
Miss Xie has her own feet,

802
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,000
did you really have to bring her over?

803
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,519
You're not welcome here.

804
00:32:06,519 --> 00:32:08,279
I only welcome Miss Xie, right?

805
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,200
Yes.

806
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,400
Now I have sister-in-law backing me up.

807
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,599
You can't bully me anymore.

808
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:15,319
If you two keep this up,

809
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:17,839
I really won't dare to speak anymore.

810
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,160
Alright.

811
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,000
Please head back.

812
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:22,119
Yu Xin and I

813
00:32:22,119 --> 00:32:23,000
will walk back.

814
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,759
We just finished eating, so we'll take a walk.

815
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,160
We'll go ahead.

816
00:32:27,319 --> 00:32:28,079
We're leaving, sister-in-law.

817
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:28,680
Go ahead.

818
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:28,880
Please go back.

819
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:29,720
Rest early.

820
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:31,359
Goodbye.

821
00:32:33,559 --> 00:32:34,359
Are you cold?

822
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:44,960
Come here.

823
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:50,720
Old Cui,

824
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:52,519
what exactly are you trying to do?

825
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,119
He's a guest.

826
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,759
It's not easy for him to come here.

827
00:32:56,279 --> 00:32:58,559
Liang Shuo is your sworn brother.

828
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,279
Did you see the look on his face just now?

829
00:33:00,279 --> 00:33:01,119
If I hadn't been there,

830
00:33:01,119 --> 00:33:02,200
he would have slammed the table.

831
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:04,200
I...

832
00:33:04,599 --> 00:33:05,519
I'm talking to you.

833
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:06,480
Did you hear me?

834
00:33:06,839 --> 00:33:07,920
What do you know?

835
00:33:09,599 --> 00:33:10,759
It's exactly because we're brothers

836
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,400
that I've been helping him avoid trouble.

837
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,160
So this is the attitude you have with me now?

838
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,799
Let me tell you, Cui Mo,

839
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,559
don't bring your work attitude

840
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:21,559
into our home.

841
00:33:21,559 --> 00:33:23,039
I'm not buying it.

842
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:23,799
How many times have I told you,

843
00:33:23,799 --> 00:33:24,839
don't meddle in men's business.

844
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:25,440
Enough.

845
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:26,559
Go upstairs and rest.

846
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:30,640
So this is how you treat me now?

847
00:33:36,519 --> 00:33:37,559
Alright, that's enough.

848
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,839
Why are you crying all of a sudden?

849
00:33:42,519 --> 00:33:43,640
Okay, okay, it's alright.

850
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,279
It's all my fault, okay?

851
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,240
I've been feeling troubled lately.

852
00:33:47,799 --> 00:33:48,880
Liang Shuo is in danger.

853
00:33:52,079 --> 00:33:54,359
We've been married for so many years.

854
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,079
If you have something to say, just tell me directly.

855
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,119
When you were eating just now,

856
00:34:01,119 --> 00:34:02,640
the look on your face,

857
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,799
that expression,

858
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,119
I know what it means.

859
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,839
You were only thinking about work.

860
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:10,960
You weren't really here to keep me company.

861
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:14,360
How long has it been since you spent time with me?

862
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:17,639
Enough.

863
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:19,039
A perfectly good meal

864
00:34:19,559 --> 00:34:21,440
was ruined by you.

865
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:24,159
Are we not supposed to live our lives anymore?

866
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:25,119
Fine, let's not.

867
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,920
How many times have I told you?

868
00:34:27,039 --> 00:34:28,079
This is politics.

869
00:34:28,119 --> 00:34:29,239
It's dangerous—it could cost lives.

870
00:34:29,519 --> 00:34:30,639
Even if I explain, you don't understand.

871
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,360
Besides, it has nothing to do with you.

872
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:34,440
Miss Xie is coming to work at the jewelry store.

873
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,360
How does that have nothing to do with me?

874
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:39,920
You've been brothers with Liang Shuo for so many years.

875
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:42,519
Why are you setting him up?

876
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,440
Back then, he risked his life

877
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,960
to save you from being shot.

878
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,199
Have you forgotten?

879
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:48,679
I haven't forgotten.

880
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:51,199
It's because I see him as a brother for life and death

881
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:51,880
that I can't just watch him

882
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,519
walk step by step into such a dangerous situation.

883
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:55,400
I trust him even more than I trust myself.

884
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,440
But I don't trust anyone around him.

885
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:57,400
I don't trust any of them.

886
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,840
Miss Xie seems like a good person.

887
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,119
A good person? You think everyone looks like a good person.

888
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:04,280
Do I look like a good person to you?

889
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:08,960
Yes.

890
00:35:09,679 --> 00:35:10,719
In my heart,

891
00:35:10,719 --> 00:35:13,079
you're the best person in the world.

892
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Do you know what people say about me out there?

893
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:26,760
Traitor, lackey, betrayer of the country.

894
00:35:28,679 --> 00:35:29,960
Maybe in this world,

895
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,599
I'm only a good person in your eyes.

896
00:35:34,639 --> 00:35:36,639
Anti-Japanese agents don't wear labels on their faces.

897
00:35:37,559 --> 00:35:38,480
If I discover them,

898
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,320
it's better than being found by the Japanese.

899
00:35:42,519 --> 00:35:44,519
Do you know what they do to undercover agents?

900
00:35:48,159 --> 00:35:49,840
If Liang Shuo falls into their hands,

901
00:35:50,119 --> 00:35:51,239
he'll wish he were dead.

902
00:35:52,639 --> 00:35:53,920
What should we do then?

903
00:35:54,119 --> 00:35:56,239
Then, will you be in danger?

904
00:35:57,199 --> 00:35:58,039
Don't worry.

905
00:35:59,519 --> 00:36:01,480
If Miss Xie can take this job,

906
00:36:02,119 --> 00:36:03,320
it means there's not much of a problem.

907
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:05,800
All these years,

908
00:36:06,039 --> 00:36:07,360
I've helped No. 76 and the Japanese

909
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,760
with so many things

910
00:36:09,039 --> 00:36:10,920
just to keep our family away from danger.

911
00:36:12,559 --> 00:36:13,360
Trust me.

912
00:36:14,239 --> 00:36:16,239
I won't let you get hurt, not even a little.

913
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,400
Whether it's No. 76

914
00:36:20,719 --> 00:36:22,519
or the Nanjing government,

915
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,559
I'm just an ordinary woman.

916
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:29,800
I just want to live a peaceful life with you.

917
00:36:31,719 --> 00:36:33,719
I want to grow old with you.

918
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:40,039
I hope you all stay well.

919
00:36:42,679 --> 00:36:44,599
If you want to live peacefully,

920
00:36:45,079 --> 00:36:46,199
then you have to do me a favor.

921
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:48,400
What is it?

922
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,960
Go visit Miss Xie for me tomorrow.

923
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:54,320
But I don't know how to do what you all do.

924
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,360
Why did you agree to Tremor?

925
00:37:13,039 --> 00:37:13,719
You know very well

926
00:37:13,719 --> 00:37:15,320
that the partnership is just a cover.

927
00:37:16,039 --> 00:37:17,719
They're just looking for a better excuse

928
00:37:17,719 --> 00:37:18,920
to keep an eye on you.

929
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,239
I know.

930
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,239
I promised you

931
00:37:23,239 --> 00:37:24,559
that I'd take you away from Shanghai.

932
00:37:24,559 --> 00:37:25,519
I didn't do it.

933
00:37:25,679 --> 00:37:26,559
So at the very least,

934
00:37:26,559 --> 00:37:28,199
I want to help cover for you.

935
00:37:28,559 --> 00:37:30,599
They've never stopped suspecting you.

936
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:31,760
By agreeing to him,

937
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,800
at least I can make them let their guard down for now.

938
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:36,599
But this way,

939
00:37:37,159 --> 00:37:38,800
you'll be even more trapped.

940
00:37:39,079 --> 00:37:40,039
Do you realize that?

941
00:37:40,679 --> 00:37:41,480
I do.

942
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:43,559
I'm going to stay with you until the end.

943
00:37:46,679 --> 00:37:47,800
Don't get me wrong.

944
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,360
I just know right from wrong.

945
00:37:49,679 --> 00:37:50,920
Since I promised you,

946
00:37:51,199 --> 00:37:52,960
I hope I can really help you.

947
00:37:53,519 --> 00:37:54,280
Besides,

948
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,000
I'm not just doing this for you.

949
00:37:56,639 --> 00:37:57,800
Like you said,

950
00:37:58,119 --> 00:38:00,320
do the questions and answers really matter?

951
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,679
As long as you can face your own conscience,

952
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:04,880
do whatever you want to do.

953
00:38:05,159 --> 00:38:06,719
If you do it, you'll never regret it.

954
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:09,559
Otherwise, in times like these,

955
00:38:09,559 --> 00:38:11,079
what's the point of living?

956
00:38:13,559 --> 00:38:14,639
You understand what I'm saying,

957
00:38:14,639 --> 00:38:15,400
right?

958
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,960
Life is not meant for mere survival.

959
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:32,000
It is about seeking light, forging the soul, and passing on the torch with determination.

960
00:38:34,039 --> 00:38:34,840
This is

961
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,719
what my uncle once said.

962
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:40,599
Life

963
00:38:41,239 --> 00:38:42,480
should not simply

964
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,159
be lived just for survival.

965
00:38:44,599 --> 00:38:45,800
Instead, we should pursue

966
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:47,840
higher goals and greater meaning.

967
00:38:48,679 --> 00:38:50,599
This includes seeking truth and light,

968
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,039
forging a steadfast spirit and character,

969
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,719
and saving the nation in times of crisis.

970
00:38:57,119 --> 00:38:58,400
These are not just empty words.

971
00:39:00,039 --> 00:39:00,840
In China today,

972
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,679
we have over four hundred million compatriots.

973
00:39:03,679 --> 00:39:05,039
If all these compatriots

974
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:06,599
can unite,

975
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,719
they will form

976
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,880
an unbreakable Great Wall of steel.

977
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:12,960
At that time,

978
00:39:13,719 --> 00:39:15,679
we will fear neither storms nor gunfire.

979
00:39:16,559 --> 00:39:18,119
And this Great Wall of steel

980
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,239
is the truth

981
00:39:20,719 --> 00:39:21,920
and light

982
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,480
that the Communists pursue.

983
00:39:27,079 --> 00:39:27,760
You

984
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,000
remember it all now.

985
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:35,559
I only remember that sentence.

986
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,280
The rest of this

987
00:39:37,719 --> 00:39:39,559
is my recent personal reflection.

988
00:39:43,079 --> 00:39:43,880
Actually,

989
00:39:44,519 --> 00:39:47,360
my understanding of the Communist Party and communism

990
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,639
has only just begun.

991
00:39:48,639 --> 00:39:49,559
Just like you.

992
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:51,840
But the more I learn,

993
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,719
the more I am convinced

994
00:39:55,719 --> 00:39:57,000
that the ways of the Military Bureau

995
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:59,719
cannot give the people a bright future.

996
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,440
If at first

997
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:04,840
I did it to fulfill Uncle Yan's last wish,

998
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,159
now

999
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:08,119
choosing the Communist Party

1000
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,760
is the result of my careful consideration.

1001
00:40:15,199 --> 00:40:16,280
If possible,

1002
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,480
I want to choose again.

1003
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,920
I want to understand you all better.

1004
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,679
And understand the Communist Party better.

1005
00:40:24,599 --> 00:40:26,039
It's never too late.

1006
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:28,400
Then you have to promise me

1007
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,760
to let me partner with you one more time.

1008
00:40:32,679 --> 00:40:33,159
Alright.

1009
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,159
I promise you.

1010
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:38,519
Let's go.

1011
00:40:42,599 --> 00:40:44,280
I've been thinking about this for a while.

1012
00:40:45,039 --> 00:40:46,719
Shanghai is getting more and more chaotic now.

1013
00:40:47,519 --> 00:40:48,440
But inevitably,

1014
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:50,320
it drags you into the center of the storm.

1015
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,320
I hope there will be a day when we can both get out safely.

1016
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,039
We definitely can.

1017
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:58,960
Once we've chosen this path,

1018
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:00,800
nothing is certain.

1019
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,039
I said we definitely can,

1020
00:41:03,639 --> 00:41:04,719
so we definitely can.

1021
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:08,760
Promise me.

1022
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:14,360
Promise me.

1023
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:22,840
I promise you.

1024
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:26,039
Let's go.

1025
00:41:44,039 --> 00:41:45,039
Didn't you ask

1026
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,079
which of the two movies I wanted to watch?

1027
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:50,360
I want to watch both.

1028
00:41:52,239 --> 00:41:53,039
Greedy.

1029
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:55,719
I've always been this greedy.

1030
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,360
Then let's make it our promise.

1031
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:03,039
No backing out!
