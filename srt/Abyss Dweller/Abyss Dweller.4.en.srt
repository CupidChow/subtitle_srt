1
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,840
So what are you planning to do next?

2
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:51,280
I want to investigate Yan Jiu again.

3
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:54,040
I've run out of leads for now.

4
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:56,230
Maybe with Yan Jiu,

5
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,430
there are clues about my identity.

6
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:00,480
A big businessman.

7
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,480
Yan Jiu.

8
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,150
It's said the Japanese have been watching him for a while.

9
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,310
There's a Yan residence on Fuxing Road.

10
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:09,800
But it's definitely dangerous.

11
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:12,630
I have no other choice.

12
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,280
Take it easy.

13
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,520
How about this,

14
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:20,960
I'll go buy you some medicine first.

15
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:22,190
Wait until you've recovered.

16
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:23,960
Then you can think about what to do next.

17
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,910
It's not too late.

18
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:26,240
I'm leaving now.

19
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:38,960
Miss, take a look at these flutes.

20
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:41,030
Cigarettes for sale.

21
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:42,840
Feather dusters for sale.

22
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:48,120
Handmade flutes.

23
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,750
No, thank you.

24
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:52,630
Take a look.

25
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,360
Brother.

26
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:55,840
Brother.

27
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:56,680
There they are.

28
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,400
Over there, chase them!

29
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,030
Chase!

30
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:00,430
Watch out.

31
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:06,400
Stop!

32
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:08,280
Stop!

33
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:11,520
Stop!

34
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,630
Don't run!

35
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:15,520
You, stop right there!

36
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:15,870
Stop!

37
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,400
Stop!

38
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,150
Stop! Stop!

39
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:27,560
Run!

40
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,000
Keep running, Little Pepper.

41
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,590
Aren't you good at running?

42
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:34,360
Fat Jin.

43
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,310
I haven't settled the score with you yet.

44
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,520
You really have the nerve to come see me.

45
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,560
And you even try to stop me.

46
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,280
You're suspected of betraying the party.

47
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,560
I've already reported you to the station chief.

48
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,030
You'll be expelled from the party.

49
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:46,520
But,

50
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,840
if you beg me nicely now,

51
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:50,360
maybe I can put in a good word for you with the chief.

52
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,470
Say a few nice things for you.

53
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:53,280
Help you get out of trouble.

54
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:55,680
But if you still don't know what's good for you,

55
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,190
What are you doing?

56
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,190
Step back.

57
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:01,400
What?

58
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,960
No evidence?

59
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:04,360
You want to execute me on the spot?

60
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:06,520
Accuse me of betraying the party?

61
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,800
Fat Jin.

62
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:09,150
You'd better watch what you say.

63
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,680
If you have the guts today,

64
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,910
come back to the Shanghai station with me.

65
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,840
Explain everything clearly and openly.

66
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:16,070
If you don't have the guts,

67
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:17,800
then hurry up

68
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,950
and get out of here with your tail between your legs.

69
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,800
Fine, fine, fine.

70
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:23,920
Still so sharp-tongued.

71
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:29,750
What a pity.

72
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:33,390
Now, should I crush you flat or roll you into a ball?

73
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:35,630
It's entirely up to me.

74
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:37,270
Where is it?

75
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,680
Hand it over.

76
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,240
What are you talking about?

77
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,920
Still pretending to be clueless?

78
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,160
You secretly investigated the military warehouse.

79
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,600
And you even stole the safe's key.

80
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,720
Give it to me now.

81
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,000
I might let you go.

82
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,070
Take it out.

83
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:53,750
So what you've been thinking about all along

84
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,120
is that key.

85
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,720
That key seems pretty important.

86
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:00,160
If it's gone,

87
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,480
then inside the safe,

88
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,000
the untraceable firearms and gold

89
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,160
can't be taken out.

90
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,070
Enough with the nonsense.

91
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:06,680
Give it to me.

92
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:11,720
Back.

93
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:13,920
Back.

94
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,480
Alright, alright, back, back, back.

95
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,160
Back.

96
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:18,800
No.

97
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:19,360
Back.

98
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,560
Back, back, back.

99
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,040
It's this key, right, Fatty Jin?

100
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,120
Yes, yes, that's right.

101
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:24,800
Chili, don't get so worked up.

102
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,750
It's just a key.

103
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,070
Give it, give it to me.

104
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:28,040
I'll give it to you.

105
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:29,560
As long as you can catch it.

106
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,950
It's yours.

107
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,390
You two, go after them!

108
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:35,950
Hurry up!

109
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:36,480
Go.

110
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,310
What are you standing around for?

111
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:38,390
Get down there and fish it out!

112
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:45,600
They went that way.

113
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,390
Boss.

114
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:48,750
They should be nearby.

115
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,830
He's definitely connected to Master Jiu's death.

116
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:51,600
Catch him.

117
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,240
Finish him off.

118
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:52,720
Yes.

119
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,720
Boss, we've found them.

120
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,560
They're over there.

121
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:55,190
Let's go.

122
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:55,600
Go.

123
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:20,680
Boss.

124
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,190
They're inside.

125
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:21,800
Search.

126
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,270
Yes.

127
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:32,040
Teacher

128
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:33,360
It's windy outside

129
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,630
Let's go inside

130
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,310
Just thinking about going back to Shanghai

131
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:39,510
keeps me tossing and turning, unable to sleep

132
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:41,870
In the middle of the night

133
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:43,830
I always think of those years

134
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:46,680
and that wonton shop in front of the Shanghai office

135
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:49,720
In the blink of an eye

136
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:52,680
seven years have passed

137
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:55,160
Teacher, what are you worried about?

138
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,680
Chengchun

139
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,120
tell me

140
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:00,680
the plan set by Director Dai

141
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:02,630
what is it for?

142
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:04,720
To sabotage the peace conference

143
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,270
jointly held by the Japanese cabinet and the Wang puppet government

144
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,240
The peace conference

145
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,480
what is it for?

146
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,360
The fighting in Central China is intense

147
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,390
The Japanese army is advancing straight toward Chongqing

148
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,560
What they are plotting

149
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,680
is nothing more than to better

150
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,750
control the areas of our country that have already fallen

151
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,310
That's right

152
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:26,390
The Battle of Wuhan

153
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,240
cost the Japanese army two hundred thousand casualties

154
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:32,040
It really shook their foundation

155
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,480
It was an unprecedented pyrrhic victory for them

156
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,870
I believe, to some extent

157
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,720
it has already dealt a blow to Japan's ambition to annex China

158
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:44,120
So

159
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:46,310
they are trying to create

160
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:47,950
a false image of peace and prosperity

161
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:49,750
so they can make a comeback

162
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,160
We absolutely cannot give them this chance

163
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:56,480
But there's one thing

164
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,000
that's quite suspicious.

165
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,480
Ever since we received the tip-off,

166
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,270
more than twenty days have passed.

167
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,360
Our intelligence network

168
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,920
hasn't been able to detect any

169
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,920
confidential information related to the Peace Conference.

170
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:10,270
All we know is that the conference will be held in thirty days

171
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:12,160
somewhere in the northern district of Shanghai.

172
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:13,950
The exact location,

173
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,040
the schedule for the day,

174
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:16,160
the conference agenda,

175
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,510
and the documents to be signed—

176
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:19,360
we know nothing about any of it.

177
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:21,830
It is indeed suspicious.

178
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:22,950
As far as I know,

179
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:24,190
just the puppet government alone

180
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:26,630
plans to send over two hundred officials to attend.

181
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:27,800
With such a big event,

182
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,950
such a large-scale operation,

183
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,630
yet all along,

184
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:32,360
we only hear about it on the surface,

185
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:33,790
but never see its essence.

186
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:36,080
Before returning to Shanghai this time,

187
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,200
I arranged for Lu Xijian to be transferred to the Shanghai station

188
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:41,120
precisely to uncover

189
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,240
the secrets behind the Peace Conference.

190
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:44,720
I just didn't expect

191
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,510
that the two agents I personally placed

192
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:50,550
would both meet with accidents one after another.

193
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:52,750
It's like a fog is clouding our vision.

194
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,080
It seems that if we want to find out

195
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,000
what's really hidden behind the Peace Conference,

196
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,000
we'll have to take it one step at a time.

197
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,960
No matter what,

198
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,600
we must find a way to destroy it.

199
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,360
Yes.

200
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,270
Teacher

201
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:09,030
The weather is about to change.

202
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:11,510
A storm is brewing in the mountains.

203
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,320
The wind fills the building.

204
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,870
What is meant to come

205
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,750
will always come.

206
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,000
I'm back.

207
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,720
So many cops around.

208
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,600
It's not usually this strict.

209
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:30,960
These are unusual times.

210
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,550
If no one questioned me,

211
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:33,720
that would actually be strange.

212
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:37,510
The guys heard you were back.

213
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:38,790
Everyone was really excited.

214
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,200
They wanted to throw a welcome party for you.

215
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:41,480
But right now,

216
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,790
let's skip the party.

217
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,670
Of the old crew,

218
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,320
how many are left?

219
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,150
Not many.

220
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,630
After you retired,

221
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:51,790
we've been struggling too.

222
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:52,440
Some died,

223
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,240
some got hurt.

224
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:54,550
Those who stayed,

225
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,200
are just trying to make a living,

226
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,790
working for Wang Mutian,

227
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:59,390
getting by at the Shanghai station.

228
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:01,790
This time, I came

229
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:05,320
to help you get your place back.

230
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,600
Drive.

231
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:17,120
Old Dong

232
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,150
Boss, the usual, please.

233
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:19,320
Alright, have a seat first.

234
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,440
Old Lu

235
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:22,670
You know, right?

236
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,480
Something big happened in Shanghai recently.

237
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:25,750
What happened?

238
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:26,670
Master Jiu is dead.

239
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:29,910
Big Brother

240
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:31,200
He should be somewhere around here.

241
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:32,840
Master Jiu's death is definitely connected to him.

242
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,510
Catch him.

243
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:34,270
Take him out.

244
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:36,150
Take a look, everyone.

245
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:36,960
This is the latest news.

246
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,670
They say he had an accident out of town.

247
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:39,440
Yan Residence

248
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,600
They're holding a memorial right now.

249
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:41,790
Really?

250
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:43,240
He was perfectly fine,

251
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,870
how could he just die like that?

252
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:45,720
These days,

253
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,600
you never know.

254
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:48,120
Someone as kind as Master Jiu,

255
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:48,720
usually,

256
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,360
not only helped with disaster relief,

257
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:52,390
but also did favors for the gangs.

258
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:54,750
Who wouldn't show him some respect?

259
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,480
Besides, the poor people around here

260
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,440
have all received his help in one way or another.

261
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,670
That's right, that's true.

262
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:02,790
I just can't believe he died in an accident.

263
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:05,600
I heard he was in Shanghai not long ago,

264
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,840
and was even invited to Hongkou for tea.

265
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,600
Stop, stop.

266
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,790
It's not good to talk about things like this carelessly.

267
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,510
Who are you?

268
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,200
That's pretty strange.

269
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:19,960
Do you know each other?

270
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:20,670
No, we don't.

271
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:21,390
No, we don't.

272
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:22,630
This person is pretty strange.

273
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,550
Have you found Shadow?

274
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:31,480
Not yet.

275
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,480
We're still investigating.

276
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:34,120
We still can't be sure yet.

277
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,790
What exactly happened to Shadow.

278
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:37,670
But according to the informant's report,

279
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,200
the Military Police and Unit 76

280
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,120
are at Ruijin Building and Tailong Trading

281
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,440
hunting down suspicious individuals.

282
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:43,750
The key point is,

283
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:44,840
this person successfully

284
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,120
escaped from Hirata Xizi's pursuit.

285
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:49,870
You suspect it's him?

286
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,600
The time and place match.

287
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,670
But we can't be sure.

288
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:53,750
Logically,

289
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,510
his mission was to find out from Yan Jiu

290
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:57,000
where the explosives went.

291
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,750
There was no need to show up at those two places.

292
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,320
Doing this is too risky.

293
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:02,750
Unless he

294
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:03,750
Unless what

295
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,320
These actions

296
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:06,550
are too reckless

297
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,270
They don't seem like something he would do at all

298
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,150
Teacher

299
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,080
Maybe there's a special reason

300
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,200
Normally

301
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,240
if he returned to Shanghai

302
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,750
he would contact the Yan family right away

303
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,360
The current plan

304
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,480
is already in chaos

305
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:21,840
We can't judge by common sense

306
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:24,790
I just hope

307
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,240
his identity won't be exposed

308
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,150
Turn left ahead

309
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:30,910
Let's go somewhere first

310
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:31,960
Where to

311
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:36,360
Since we can't get useful information from the inside

312
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,390
we can only rely on that lady

313
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:41,870
Go meet her

314
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,240
Yes

315
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:58,030
Miss Jiang

316
00:13:58,030 --> 00:14:00,000
I'll take my leave now

317
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,200
Take care

318
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,790
Miss Jiang, please return

319
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,080
Miss Jiang

320
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:08,840
There's a guest outside who wants to see you

321
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,630
It's an old acquaintance of mine

322
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:20,960
Please invite the guest up quickly

323
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:22,870
No one else is allowed to disturb us

324
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:23,510
Alright

325
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:32,960
Previously, with you, Miss,

326
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,870
after our brief meeting in Shanghai,

327
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,320
though we've only corresponded by letter since,

328
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:38,840
your words still linger in my ears.

329
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:40,600
Every time I read them,

330
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:42,670
it feels as if I am meeting you in person.

331
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:46,550
Mr. Gu, I hope you have been well.

332
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,550
The national situation has been unpredictable lately.

333
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,720
I have managed to get by safely.

334
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:55,080
I wonder how you have been recently, Miss.

335
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:57,870
Feiman is doing well.

336
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:00,030
Thank you for your concern, Mr. Gu.

337
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:03,200
If I may ask,

338
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:05,150
what brings you here today?

339
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,870
What is the purpose of your visit?

340
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:10,440
I came to Pingchuan Academy to see Miss Feiman.

341
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:12,270
Besides enjoying the music,

342
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:13,390
there is another reason.

343
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,790
I am here to seek information.

344
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,390
I must admit, to my shame,

345
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:18,080
this time, it is for the latter reason.

346
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,120
During this stay in Shanghai,

347
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,240
I will be staying for a short while.

348
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,240
I hope to

349
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,320
maintain a long-term cooperation with you, Miss.

350
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,240
Of course.

351
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,080
I wonder, Mr. Gu,

352
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,000
what kind of information are you seeking?

353
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:46,670
The movements of Section 76 are quite secretive.

354
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:49,320
If you want to know someone's exact movements,

355
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:50,840
it's not easy.

356
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:52,480
What's more,

357
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,720
this kind of information is highly time-sensitive.

358
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:58,750
I'm afraid that even if you find out,

359
00:15:58,750 --> 00:15:59,320
it will still be difficult.

360
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,480
Miss Feiman, you've misunderstood.

361
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,480
I don't intend to take any action.

362
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,600
I just want to know his whereabouts.

363
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,510
That's all.

364
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:08,240
I see.

365
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,750
I need some time.

366
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:14,840
Alright.

367
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,510
I'll send someone to contact you again.

368
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,480
Then I'll take my leave.

369
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,080
Pingchuan Academy is a mix of all kinds of people.

370
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,720
When you come and go,

371
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,000
you must be careful.

372
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,270
Thank you for the reminder.

373
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,000
Over here.

374
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,270
Spread it out, spread it out.

375
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:44,150
Alright, alright.

376
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:44,960
Right here.

377
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:45,670
Yes.

378
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,790
Here, here, here.

379
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,080
Move aside.

380
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,600
Come down.

381
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:50,510
Come down.

382
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,360
Come down, come down.

383
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,320
Move out of the way.

384
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,270
What are you doing?

385
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:55,390
You guys, this...

386
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:56,630
What are you doing?

387
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:09,350
Chief

388
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,270
Everything is going according to plan.

389
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,750
Everyone, put on servant uniforms.

390
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:14,680
No matter who comes to pay their respects,

391
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,590
let them in first.

392
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:19,110
Cigarettes

393
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,160
Newspapers for sale!

394
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:23,550
Newspapers for sale!

395
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:25,160
Cigarettes

396
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:34,440
I want to investigate Yan Jiu again.

397
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,160
My current leads have run dry.

398
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:38,830
Maybe at Yan Jiu's place

399
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,070
there are clues about my identity.

400
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,350
Yan Residence

401
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,310
Alright

402
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:48,590
Please have a seat.

403
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,110
Miss Jiang

404
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:31,880
Your medicine

405
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:33,590
Thank you

406
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:34,680
By the way

407
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,030
Dr. Tan asked me to remind you

408
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:37,960
Be sure to decoct the turtle shell medicine first

409
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:40,070
Got it

410
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:36,270
Sir

411
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:38,720
The first group of guests here to pay their respects has arrived.

412
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:40,310
Everything outside has been arranged.

413
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:42,200
Everything is ready.

414
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,160
This time,

415
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,400
we must catch him.

416
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,200
Yes, sir.

417
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:21,830
What are you doing?

418
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:22,920
What are you doing?

419
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:24,160
Go.

420
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:26,440
It wasn't me.

421
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:27,270
Go.

422
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:28,070
You've got the wrong person.

423
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:28,400
Go!

424
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:14,160
From now on,

425
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,790
this will be your home.

426
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,350
Young man,

427
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,030
it's not your turn to pay respects yet.

428
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:10,400
There are still so many guests.

429
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,830
Once you've offered the tribute, leave quickly.

430
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,400
Honestly, you...

431
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,240
No matter how many times I tell you, you never listen.

432
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,720
Hurry up, go, go, go.

433
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:19,590
Go on.

434
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:20,790
Hurry up.

435
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,110
Go!

436
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:36,750
Who is it?

437
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,480
Uncle

438
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,400
Now that Central and Southern China have fallen,

439
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:07,960
Changsha is in grave danger.

440
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:11,750
Our nation is at a critical moment of survival.

441
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,480
The Japanese invaders are rampant.

442
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,720
The drums of war never cease.

443
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:16,350
The calamity of war

444
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:17,920
sweeps across China.

445
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:21,240
Even an ordinary man cannot shirk his responsibility.

446
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:24,750
In the past, I joined the army but failed to die for my country.

447
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:26,550
Now, I have spent all my family fortune

448
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,310
to purchase military supplies

449
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:29,640
to support the nation.

450
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,160
Please do not refuse.

451
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,440
When I saw Manchuria fall,

452
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:35,310
I realized how fragile life is.

453
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:37,590
I am willing to join the army and follow the Scorpion plan.

454
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:38,920
Cross the river and burn the boats,

455
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,440
never to turn back.

456
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:46,110
Scorpion.

457
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:54,310
Mission.

458
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:56,400
You must understand what a mission is.

459
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:57,270
Complete it.

460
00:28:57,550 --> 00:28:58,790
Do your utmost.

461
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,790
Even if it costs your life.

462
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,350
Stop!

463
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,030
Hurry!

464
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:44,000
Go after them, quickly!

465
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:48,590
Stop!

466
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:50,110
Chase after them!

467
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,310
Stop!

468
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,960
Out of the way!

469
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,480
Go to the intersection at Ding'an Road.

470
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:07,550
Find Director Cui.

471
00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:08,720
Tell him to block the crowd for me.

472
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,270
Yes.

473
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:22,920
Thank you.

474
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,270
Director

475
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,160
Director

476
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:44,550
I was hoping to catch something extra while doing this.

477
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,750
But I didn't expect the Japanese to mess it up themselves.

478
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:48,550
Now I can't explain this to Director Li.

479
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,440
What bad luck.

480
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:55,680
Instead of complaining,

481
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:58,070
you should keep your eyes open.

482
00:30:58,310 --> 00:30:59,240
Anti-Japanese elements would never

483
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,720
walk openly on the main road.

484
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:03,310
Pair up in groups of two.

485
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:06,110
Watch every street and alley for me.

486
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:09,160
I don't play games hoping for extra catches.

487
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:11,880
I'm like the King of Hell's Five-Finger Mountain.

488
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,750
No one is getting away from me.

489
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:15,440
Yes, sir.

490
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,110
Director

491
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:17,400
Our intelligence department

492
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,030
makes a living by being observant.

493
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:21,310
Director Cui

494
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:22,480
The team leader said they didn't catch anyone

495
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,640
and they're heading your way.

496
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:24,790
Got it.

497
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:28,680
Brothers,

498
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,480
did you all hear that clearly?

499
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,790
Anyone Chen Gengsheng can't catch,

500
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:35,270
we must catch.

501
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:36,200
Yes, sir.

502
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:38,030
You, come with me.

503
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:38,790
Okay.

504
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:49,680
Where is the person?

505
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,200
Didn't see them.

506
00:31:53,790 --> 00:31:55,590
Yes, sorry.

507
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:11,720
Stop!

508
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:44,750
Move aside.

509
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,110
Move aside.

510
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,160
Move aside, quickly.

511
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:52,240
Move aside.

512
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:52,880
Get out of the way.

513
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:54,400
Move aside, move aside.

514
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:19,240
Hurry.

515
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:20,400
Hurry, hurry.

516
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:25,830
Behind.

517
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:32,920
Faster, faster.

518
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:34,790
Driver, go faster.

519
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:41,920
Hurry, driver.

520
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,310
Stop, stop.

521
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,030
Keep the change.

522
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:56,110
Thank you.

523
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:31,760
Who are you?

524
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:34,000
Why are you following me?

525
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:38,480
It really is you.

526
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:46,440
Who is she?

527
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:48,880
And who are you?

528
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:50,150
Do you know me?

529
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,190
Do you know who I am?

530
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:53,400
Tell me.

531
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:55,150
What's wrong with you?

532
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:56,230
Are you crazy?

533
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:57,440
Put the gun down.

534
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,280
Tell me quickly.

535
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,280
You put the gun down.

536
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,030
Go away.

537
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:02,320
I'm helping you.

538
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:03,400
This is between us.

539
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,320
It has nothing to do with you.

540
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:06,920
Put the gun down.

541
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:08,880
Looks like today I

542
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,510
have really gained a lot.

543
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,320
Turn your head.

544
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:15,710
Or I'll shoot.

545
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:35,630
Liang Shuo.

546
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,480
What's going on?

547
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:40,760
Is this a ghost?

548
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:42,880
Didn't Director Liang die at Yulong Mountain?

549
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:43,590
Yeah, that's right.

550
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:44,400
Didn't he fall off a cliff?

551
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,710
Everyone shut up.

552
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:47,960
Put the gun down.

553
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:54,590
You scared me to death.

554
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:58,510
I thought you and Ma Yuan

555
00:35:59,110 --> 00:36:00,320
both died at Yulong Mountain.

556
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:07,280
Liang Shuo

557
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,360
What are you doing?

558
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:14,440
What on earth is going on?

559
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:15,880
Go.

560
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:17,110
Tell the director.

561
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,630
Director Liang is still alive.

562
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:19,800
He's right here in Shanghai.

563
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:20,590
Yes.

564
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:38,880
Liang, my friend, Liang.

565
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:39,760
You're back already.

566
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,000
Why didn't you let me know you were safe?

567
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:42,590
Do you know during this time

568
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,000
your men and I

569
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:46,440
have been getting by?

570
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:48,670
Director Liang.

571
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:53,400
Director Liang.

572
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:54,800
Director Liang.

573
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,110
Boss.

574
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:01,400
Boss.

575
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,000
Boss.

576
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:06,400
Boss.

577
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,110
I've been telling myself all along

578
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,480
that you'd be fine.

579
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,550
Didn't I tell you all

580
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:23,510
with Director Liang's abilities,

581
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:24,400
he'd be all right?

582
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,000
Yes.

583
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:26,480
Director Cui.

584
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:28,320
Aren't we here to catch the assassin?

585
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,440
Catch what assassin?

586
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,320
Are you blind?

587
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,670
Is Director Liang the assassin?

588
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:32,800
Yes.

589
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:37,800
Liang.

590
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:39,230
Brother.

591
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:40,880
What's wrong with you?

592
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:42,400
Liang.

593
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:48,320
I'm fine.

594
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:50,760
I'm back.

595
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:52,920
It's good that you're back.

596
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:55,110
When did you come back?

597
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:56,550
Why didn't you report back to headquarters?

598
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,480
What's going on with these two ladies?

599
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:09,320
You're Miss Jiang from Pingchuan Academy, right?

600
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:11,110
I really didn't expect that.

601
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:13,150
Your delicate hands, skilled in poetry and romance,

602
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,670
are also capable of handling a gun.

603
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,230
What is it?

604
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,670
Did this lady offend you?

605
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:23,070
This gun

606
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:24,400
is from Meihua Hall.

607
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,630
It was a gift from Mr. Mizuno.

608
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:27,440
I know.

609
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,360
You have some connection with Mr. Mizuno.

610
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,400
But brandishing a weapon in broad daylight

611
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:33,510
you owe me a reasonable explanation.

612
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:37,590
This is our personal matter.

613
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,800
It's not for you people from No. 76 to interfere.

614
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:42,230
A personal matter?

615
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:46,550
Brother,

616
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,320
what's going on?

617
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,070
Liang Shuo,

618
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:52,280
for another woman,

619
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,480
you'd even point a gun at me now?

620
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:02,440
If you have something to say, say it calmly.

621
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:04,280
Don't resort to violence.

622
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:06,030
Yeah.

623
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,510
You only see the new one smiling,

624
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,360
but never hear the old one crying.

625
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,280
From Nanjing to Chongqing,

626
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:13,110
from Chongqing to Shanghai,

627
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,710
how could you possibly remember

628
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:17,320
how much I've suffered?

629
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:18,670
All these years,

630
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,630
you've never given me an explanation.

631
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,070
I'm just not willing to let go.

632
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:23,800
You know me.

633
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,000
Some things,

634
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:26,400
if I don't hear them from you directly,

635
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,880
I won't give up.

636
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:34,440
Since things have come to this today,

637
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:37,760
and your colleagues are here as witnesses,

638
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,280
Liang Shuo,

639
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,360
make yourself clear.

640
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Choose her,

641
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,400
or choose me.

642
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:05,590
Let's end it here.

643
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:11,840
Do you even know how to use this?

644
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:14,480
The safety isn't even off.

645
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:18,030
Don't use it to scare people again.

646
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:25,880
I must have been blind.

647
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:29,630
To have fallen for you in the first place.

648
00:40:35,590 --> 00:40:36,510
Miss,

649
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:38,590
is this really the kind of man you like,

650
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:40,670
someone so fickle?

651
00:40:52,070 --> 00:40:52,880
What,

652
00:40:55,150 --> 00:40:57,070
are you going to hit me?

653
00:40:58,630 --> 00:40:59,840
You little brat, are you looking for trouble?

654
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:00,960
What are you doing?

655
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,320
Are you tired of living?

656
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,550
I'm someone who values the past.

657
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,280
You should go.

658
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:09,110
Otherwise, don't blame me for forgetting our past.

659
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:11,320
Liar.

660
00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:19,510
What is it?

661
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:22,400
Can't you hear what I'm saying?

662
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:41,590
Bro,

663
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,480
what's really going on?

664
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:46,030
You saw what happened.

665
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:47,960
Do you think I don't care about my reputation?

666
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:50,150
Fine.

667
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:51,030
We'll do as you say.

668
00:41:51,190 --> 00:41:52,070
Let's talk about it when we get back.

669
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,440
But wait a second.

670
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:55,030
About the Yulong Mountain incident,

671
00:41:55,230 --> 00:41:56,480
and about these two ladies,

672
00:41:56,670 --> 00:41:58,190
you need to explain everything to me.
