1
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:48,120
If it were just for a trivial investigation result,

2
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:50,680
why would I bother coming here myself?

3
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,280
Mr. Mizuno's capture of the infiltrator

4
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,719
was merely a fortunate accident.

5
00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:56,519
But compared to

6
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:59,200
the operation to take down the entire Military Command's Shanghai station,

7
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,159
this

8
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:01,560
is hardly worth mentioning.

9
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,319
Director Li,

10
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,439
your information is quite up-to-date.

11
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:09,000
So,

12
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,199
what interests me most is

13
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:15,240
how Mr. Mizuno managed to accomplish all this.

14
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,560
We intercepted a secret telegram from the Military Command.

15
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,400
We learned they would gather at the St. Joseph's Church on Xiao Qiao Road.

16
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:24,560
Who,

17
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,280
when,

18
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,319
and how did you decipher it?

19
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:28,000
After all these fierce battles,

20
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,120
the Military Command's Shanghai station cipher

21
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,800
changes every three days.

22
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,800
We are both in the same profession.

23
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,919
How could we not understand the difficulty involved?

24
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,479
You make it sound so easy to decipher it,

25
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,960
isn't that

26
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,240
a bit too casual?

27
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,759
Then what do you think, Director Li?

28
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:47,840
It's precisely because I don't know

29
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,039
that I'm asking you for advice.

30
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,960
But I've already explained.

31
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:54,080
Director Li, you don't believe me.

32
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,280
Mr. Mizuno,

33
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,639
Nanjing and Dong Jing

34
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:59,919
have an agreement regarding intelligence exchange.

35
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:03,240
I just hope Mr. Mizuno can be open and honest.

36
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,479
Sharing intelligence

37
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,879
is also for the sake of better cooperation in the future.

38
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:12,840
I don't know, Director Li,

39
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,599
where you got your information from.

40
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:16,080
As for me,

41
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,120
I'm just following orders.

42
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:20,400
If you have any questions, Director Li,

43
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,240
you can report them to the Army Department.

44
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,759
But I heard that the intelligence

45
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,439
is in your hands, Mr. Mizuno.

46
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,439
What intelligence

47
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:32,599
are you talking about?

48
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,680
Turning Wang Mutian and destroying the Shanghai station.

49
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,000
Mr. Mizuno,

50
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,240
why ask when you already know the answer?

51
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:46,719
I can introduce you to the person who deciphered the intelligence.

52
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,759
Mr. Mizuno, you must be joking.

53
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,719
This is like an egg:

54
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:54,599
you've already eaten the egg inside,

55
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:57,080
and now you're only willing to give me the shell.

56
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,280
Do you think

57
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,400
that's appropriate?

58
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:02,000
I'm afraid what Director Li wants isn't the egg,

59
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,599
but the hen that lays the eggs.

60
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,840
So it is true, then.

61
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:09,120
Mr. Mizuno,

62
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:11,479
I know my visit this time is rather abrupt.

63
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:13,000
According to procedure,

64
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
it should go from the Organization Department to the Foreign Ministry,

65
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:17,040
and then be submitted to the Army Department.

66
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,120
But first, the situation is urgent,

67
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,279
and second, we've known each other for a long time.

68
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,600
Does our relationship

69
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,360
mean less than a piece of intelligence?

70
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:32,600
If that's the case,

71
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:34,600
I suggest Director Li

72
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,240
stick to the proper procedures.

73
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,439
Fine.

74
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,519
Since you've said so, Mr. Mizuno,

75
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:50,199
I have nothing more to say.

76
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:51,639
Goodbye.

77
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,120
You've been at it all night.

78
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:10,199
Brother Liang,

79
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,279
I'm really curious.

80
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,680
With your abilities,

81
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:15,160
you actually didn't notice

82
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,879
any trace of Zhao Di.

83
00:05:17,079 --> 00:05:18,399
A member of the anti-Japanese resistance

84
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,680
was able to hide under your nose for so long.

85
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:22,839
That's quite a miracle.

86
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,519
Unexpected, but it makes sense.

87
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,600
The eyes of the action team and the intelligence office

88
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,000
were led around by the active Chongqing agents outside.

89
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,360
They were running all over the place.

90
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,439
And after the Chen Gengsheng incident,

91
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:36,240
everyone let their guard down.

92
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,680
That's how he found an opportunity.

93
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:39,639
Why do you look

94
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,519
not surprised at all?

95
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:44,920
I've already been interrogated by Mizuno Shingen three times.

96
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,160
Please, give me a break.

97
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,519
Stop trying to get information out of me.

98
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:48,879
I can stop asking you.

99
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,720
But what about the director?

100
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:51,319
The director—

101
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:54,079
How many people has the director hidden around me?

102
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:56,600
Was Zhao Di transferred here by me?

103
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,319
Chief Cui,

104
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,160
it looks like those ahead are our own people.

105
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:02,079
Drive over.

106
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:02,720
Yes.

107
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:06,639
The boss is here! The boss is here!

108
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,040
Boss!

109
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,759
This way, inside!

110
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:19,680
What's wrong?

111
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:20,480
Director.

112
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:22,720
Our people were at the surveillance post last night.

113
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,120
They discovered a group of Chongqing agents.

114
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:24,959
Did you catch them?

115
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:25,879
No.

116
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,319
Why are you reporting to me if you didn't catch them?

117
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:29,120
Yes.

118
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:31,040
But Miss Xie has gone missing.

119
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:33,839
What did you say?

120
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,000
Our people clashed with the agents yesterday.

121
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,040
When they came to, they realized Miss Xie was gone.

122
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,199
Brother

123
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,319
I know you're worried.

124
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,800
I just got the report myself.

125
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:25,439
There's a group of anti-Japanese activists in a nearby alley.

126
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:27,120
I'm worried about your wife's safety.

127
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:28,560
So I had them stand guard here.

128
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,079
I really didn't expect this.

129
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,480
Don't worry.

130
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,920
I'll definitely help you find her.

131
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,439
Alright?

132
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,560
Are you really worried about Yuxin's safety,

133
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,040
so you had people guard this place,

134
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:42,079
or do you just not trust me?

135
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,279
And set up surveillance?

136
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,079
Things are already so chaotic.

137
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:46,399
Of course I'm truly worried.

138
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,199
After all, she's going to be my sister-in-law.

139
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,639
They showed restraint.

140
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:06,959
It doesn't look like a kidnapping.

141
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:09,240
She left on her own accord.

142
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:10,920
No.

143
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,079
She's not an operative.

144
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,360
She probably wouldn't join any operation.

145
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:17,639
But where did she go?

146
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:22,920
All of you,

147
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:24,160
are completely useless.

148
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:25,560
You can't even keep an eye on a girl.

149
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,079
You let the Chongqing agents take advantage.

150
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:28,800
Director.

151
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:30,680
Could it be that Miss Xie

152
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,759
just wanted to go out for a walk and hasn't come back yet?

153
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,320
After all, there was activity nearby last night.

154
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,759
Don't give me that nonsense.

155
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:37,679
There was gunfire outside.

156
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:38,639
And you think she just went for a stroll?

157
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:40,039
Let me tell you all,

158
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,600
there's a church four miles away.

159
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,799
A group of Chongqing agents is there.

160
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,159
If anything happens to my sister-in-law,

161
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:46,879
I'll skin you all alive.

162
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:47,960
Director.

163
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,919
Could it be the Chongqing agents

164
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:51,399
kidnapped Miss Xie

165
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,679
and took her to the Xiaoqiao Lutheran Church?

166
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,919
Brother, brother!

167
00:08:54,919 --> 00:08:55,679
What are you standing around for?

168
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:56,320
Go after them!

169
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,039
Liang Shuo!

170
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:04,200
Liang Shuo!

171
00:09:09,639 --> 00:09:10,639
The boss told us to look.

172
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:11,639
How are we supposed to look?

173
00:09:11,799 --> 00:09:12,720
This place is huge.

174
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:14,960
You guys,

175
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:16,960
split up and search around.

176
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:17,759
Right.

177
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:18,519
Open your mouths.

178
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:18,840
Yeah.

179
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,600
Call out for Miss Xie.

180
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,399
Call out as you search.

181
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:20,759
Okay.

182
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:21,600
Everyone, louder.

183
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,919
Miss Xie! Miss Xie! Miss Xie!

184
00:09:25,159 --> 00:09:26,480
Miss Xie!

185
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,240
Miss Xie! Miss Xie!

186
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,960
Miss Xie! Miss Xie! Miss Xie!

187
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:31,840
Any sign?

188
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,799
No.

189
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,039
Where could she have gone?

190
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,120
Is that Miss Xie?

191
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:40,399
Miss Xie!

192
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:47,919
Liang Shuo.

193
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,639
Liang Shuo.

194
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:50,679
Come down.

195
00:09:51,879 --> 00:09:52,879
Liang Shuo, what are you doing?

196
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:53,639
Liang Shuo!

197
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:54,720
The Japanese have already surrounded that area.

198
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,840
Are you walking right into their guns?

199
00:09:55,919 --> 00:09:56,519
Liang Shuo!

200
00:09:56,519 --> 00:09:57,720
Can you not be so reckless?

201
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,279
This afternoon.

202
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,759
I'll definitely give you news this afternoon.

203
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,840
Do you think I can wait until this afternoon?

204
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,559
If the boss's wife was missing, could you wait?

205
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:05,600
Even so, that's too dangerous.

206
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:45,279
Xie

207
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:46,039
Miss Xie

208
00:10:46,039 --> 00:10:46,399
Director

209
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:47,120
Xie

210
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:49,879
Tell the nearby brothers

211
00:10:49,879 --> 00:10:50,679
to all disperse

212
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,720
and not to hang around here

213
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,399
Yes

214
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:53,720
Come on, spread out, spread out

215
00:10:53,799 --> 00:10:54,639
Go, go, go

216
00:10:57,679 --> 00:10:58,559
It's okay now

217
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:06,879
I got your message

218
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,200
But it was already too late

219
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:14,320
A lot of people have died

220
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,720
Brother Chengchun too

221
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:21,799
I know

222
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,240
It was all a trap set by Mizuno

223
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:30,600
Everything will pass

224
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:34,519
Now is not the time to grieve

225
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:46,519
We will avenge them

226
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:47,919
Right?

227
00:11:56,159 --> 00:11:56,960
Of course

228
00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:13,000
Director

229
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:14,480
Tell me

230
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,120
Where has Miss Xie been all night?

231
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,240
We'll talk about it later

232
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:43,480
Directors,

233
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,080
Where are we going next?

234
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,720
We definitely can't go back to your sister-in-law's place.

235
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:49,919
In my opinion,

236
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,200
why don't we go to your place?

237
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:52,679
You're engaged anyway.

238
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:56,000
So stop making excuses.

239
00:12:56,279 --> 00:12:57,480
Given the current situation,

240
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,279
I don't feel comfortable letting you stay at a hotel alone.

241
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:02,120
But I didn't bring any of my clothes with me.

242
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,279
And also,

243
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:04,919
Brother Cui,

244
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:06,080
could I trouble you

245
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,440
to take us back one more time?

246
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:09,080
It's no trouble at all.

247
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:09,519
Let's go.

248
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,000
Thank you, Brother Cui.

249
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:25,279
We didn't catch Scorpion.

250
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:26,639
I am responsible.

251
00:13:27,559 --> 00:13:29,279
The escaped Chongqing members

252
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:30,759
still don't pose a threat to us.

253
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:32,279
But

254
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:34,440
I'm still worried.

255
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,799
Worried about what?

256
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:38,000
Scorpion's successful escape

257
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,519
was because someone on the vehicle

258
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:40,519
honked the horn as a warning.

259
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:43,000
This indirectly proves

260
00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:45,519
that someone, through special channels,

261
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,399
got the information in advance.

262
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:50,559
This means

263
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:53,240
there are still people who slipped through the net.

264
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:54,639
Yes.

265
00:13:55,039 --> 00:13:55,799
Actually,

266
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,120
Wang Mutian is a breakthrough point.

267
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,879
The list submitted by the Shanghai station

268
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:01,240
of underground party members

269
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,759
is still missing some names, isn't it?

270
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:05,399
The people missing from the list

271
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,879
are very likely involved in this incident.

272
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:09,840
Understood.

273
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,879
I'll start investigating right away.

274
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,679
What's Wang Mutian's current condition?

275
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,080
He lost an arm.

276
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,519
He's still being treated.

277
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,679
If he still can't speak,

278
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,759
have him identify people by their photos.

279
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,480
Find those who slipped through the net as soon as possible.

280
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,080
This matter

281
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,039
I'll take care of it right away.

282
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:43,279
Feiman

283
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,399
Old Tan

284
00:14:46,039 --> 00:14:47,519
The organization's prediction was correct.

285
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:49,960
This list is too powerful.

286
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,799
If we don't take action soon,

287
00:14:55,919 --> 00:14:57,399
I'm afraid more people

288
00:14:57,639 --> 00:14:59,039
will be sacrificed because of the list.

289
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:02,960
Once the full power of the list is unleashed,

290
00:15:03,159 --> 00:15:05,080
it won't just be a matter for the military intelligence.

291
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,879
I'm afraid the interests of the whole country and nation

292
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,240
will be harmed.

293
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,960
We must

294
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,039
have Comrade Qingshuang

295
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:14,559
do everything possible

296
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:15,480
to track down the list.

297
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:24,000
Come in.

298
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,159
You've been here before.

299
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:34,200
From now on, you'll live here.

300
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:38,480
This is the bedroom.

301
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,480
You'll sleep here from now on.

302
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:43,720
There's only one bed.

303
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,279
There are two of us.

304
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:47,559
I'll sleep in the study.

305
00:15:48,039 --> 00:15:48,840
Come with me.

306
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:50,559
Okay.

307
00:15:56,279 --> 00:15:57,720
There's a camp bed in the closet.

308
00:15:58,039 --> 00:15:58,639
When it's time to sleep,

309
00:15:58,639 --> 00:15:59,720
I'll take it out.

310
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,879
I'll put it back in the morning.

311
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:02,120
So no one gets suspicious.

312
00:16:02,919 --> 00:16:03,720
Okay.

313
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,519
What exactly happened last night?

314
00:16:08,679 --> 00:16:10,399
Mizuno made a move against the Shanghai station.

315
00:16:11,879 --> 00:16:13,159
Wang Mutian betrayed us.

316
00:16:13,879 --> 00:16:15,440
The entire Shanghai station was wiped out.

317
00:16:15,799 --> 00:16:18,080
It's impossible to sabotage the Peace Conference now.

318
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,480
Wang Mutian has betrayed us.

319
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:23,799
Mr. Liu said

320
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,279
the Japanese had already

321
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:27,240
compiled a list several years ago.

322
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,559
Wang Mutian must have defected

323
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:30,720
to the enemy years ago.

324
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:33,159
He was only activated now.

325
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:35,919
The 3-1 List.

326
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,039
We need to meet Scorpio as soon as possible.

327
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:41,519
We have to get to the bottom of this.

328
00:16:41,799 --> 00:16:43,440
If the list is exposed,

329
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:44,759
it will be too late.

330
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:46,159
His latest order

331
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:47,279
is to stay put.

332
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:48,320
Wait for further instructions.

333
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,240
Looks like he needs time

334
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,840
to adjust his plan.

335
00:16:56,919 --> 00:16:57,840
Stop thinking about it for now.

336
00:16:58,039 --> 00:16:58,879
Take a break.

337
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,120
I'll get you a glass of water.

338
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,119
What are you writing?

339
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:25,759
It's nothing.

340
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,359
Have some hot water.

341
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:30,160
Thank you.

342
00:17:34,759 --> 00:17:37,240
Is your head injury getting worse?

343
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,440
You're keeping records.

344
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:41,440
Did you encrypt them?

345
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:43,400
What if someone finds them?

346
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:44,519
That's very dangerous.

347
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:47,440
You need a codebook.

348
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:49,319
This is my old specialty.

349
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:50,920
I can help you.

350
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,680
I'm afraid I'll forget the codebook.

351
00:17:58,359 --> 00:17:59,160
Wait a moment.

352
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,440
Here you go.

353
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:30,519
The Communist Manifesto.

354
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:33,480
This must not be discovered.

355
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:35,039
I know.

356
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,920
Just use it as your codebook.

357
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,279
Even if you forget,

358
00:18:38,279 --> 00:18:39,440
I believe

359
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,880
you will still find your faith.

360
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:44,240
Alright.

361
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,279
Then let's use it.

362
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:48,000
Thank you.

363
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:50,680
No need to be so polite.

364
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,119
We're truly partners now.

365
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,359
They've been watching me all the time.

366
00:18:54,359 --> 00:18:55,279
And I can't leave.

367
00:18:56,839 --> 00:18:58,599
Just tell me what you want to record.

368
00:18:58,599 --> 00:18:59,680
I'll help you write it.

369
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:01,319
But

370
00:19:02,519 --> 00:19:03,799
this house isn't safe.

371
00:19:04,279 --> 00:19:05,640
We need to find a safe place.

372
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:10,960
I know a place.

373
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:13,480
Victory Park.

374
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:15,119
It's where I met with Feiman.

375
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,599
There's a maple tree.

376
00:19:18,039 --> 00:19:19,319
A hidden spot under its roots.

377
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,559
We'll wrap it in oil paper.

378
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,160
Just hide it under the roots.

379
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:24,359
Okay.

380
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,519
Leave it to me from now on.

381
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,279
You haven't slept all night.

382
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,440
Go get some rest.

383
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,680
I'm heading back to headquarters.

384
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,200
This place is very safe.

385
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,839
How is Mr. Wang doing?

386
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:52,960
He's out of danger.

387
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:57,160
That's very lucky.

388
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:00,200
He survived even after all that.

389
00:20:06,359 --> 00:20:07,039
Sir.

390
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:08,759
What is it?

391
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,880
Aren't you happy to see me visiting the patient?

392
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:11,880
Um...

393
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:12,880
The officer is here.

394
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,000
What an honor for our humble place.

395
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,519
The Imperial Japanese Army Hospital.

396
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:18,960
You make it sound so humble.

397
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:19,880
That's quite bold.

398
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:20,519
No.

399
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:21,799
A slip of the tongue. I deserve punishment.

400
00:20:26,839 --> 00:20:27,880
Mr. Takagi.

401
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:30,000
Director Mizuno.

402
00:20:31,079 --> 00:20:33,279
You promised to get me out of Shanghai.

403
00:20:34,279 --> 00:20:36,559
I don't know when you'll actually keep that promise.

404
00:20:38,519 --> 00:20:40,559
If you want the director to keep his word,

405
00:20:41,319 --> 00:20:44,000
you'll have to survive first, Mr. Wang.

406
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:46,079
Besides,

407
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:46,920
you promised back then

408
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:49,279
to hand over the entire Shanghai station.

409
00:20:49,559 --> 00:20:50,519
But now,

410
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:54,039
the one who hasn't kept their promise is you.

411
00:20:54,039 --> 00:20:54,759
Xiao—

412
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,720
The gathering at St. John's Church on Xiao Qiao Road—

413
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,920
all my Military Command operatives

414
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,680
were already present.

415
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,240
But we recently checked

416
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,079
the personnel list you submitted.

417
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,359
We found the numbers don't match.

418
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:13,319
I told you before,

419
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,000
before the operation,

420
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
a group had already been transferred.

421
00:21:18,279 --> 00:21:20,599
And those who deserted on their own—

422
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,720
That shouldn't count, right?

423
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,480
Mr. Wang,

424
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,920
I can understand your situation,

425
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:31,400
but the director won't see it that way.

426
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:34,119
These people, along with the remnants of Scorpio,

427
00:21:34,119 --> 00:21:35,880
will still pose a threat to our future operations.

428
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,400
They could cause some trouble.

429
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:39,119
Your performance

430
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:41,839
has left the director very dissatisfied.

431
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:46,279
It was you who let Scorpio escape.

432
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,640
What more do you want?

433
00:21:59,599 --> 00:22:02,440
I want you to describe the appearance of everyone who escaped.

434
00:22:02,759 --> 00:22:04,119
Describe them in detail.

435
00:22:04,519 --> 00:22:05,319
When the time comes,

436
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:08,319
I will use the portraits you provide to make arrests.

437
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:11,039
When these people are caught,

438
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:14,240
that will be the day you are allowed to leave Shanghai.

439
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,640
You don't keep your word.

440
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,079
Will you do it

441
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,799
or not?

442
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:47,880
I'll do it.

443
00:22:54,839 --> 00:22:56,200
Have you settled Miss Xie in?

444
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,119
You two,

445
00:22:59,119 --> 00:23:00,319
are always apart more than together.

446
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,880
It hardly seems like you're dating.

447
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,039
If you ask me,

448
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:04,559
she should have moved in with you long ago.

449
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,000
Sorry to trouble you, Brother Cui.

450
00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:09,200
These Chongqing elements

451
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,559
really are everywhere.

452
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:13,640
Miss Xie must have been frightened.

453
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:16,000
What happened last time with the Dafengtang remnants

454
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,240
had quite an impact on her.

455
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,680
When she heard gunshots,

456
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,240
she thought it was gang retaliation.

457
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,920
She panicked and ran out to hide.

458
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:23,759
If she hadn't seen our car,

459
00:23:23,759 --> 00:23:24,720
she wouldn't have dared to come back.

460
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,440
By the way,

461
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:27,319
that gang member we caught from Dafengtang

462
00:23:27,319 --> 00:23:28,480
is still being held.

463
00:23:28,759 --> 00:23:29,920
What do you plan to do with him?

464
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,319
I've been swamped lately.

465
00:23:33,319 --> 00:23:34,400
Let's deal with it later.

466
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:40,119
Brother Cui,

467
00:23:40,759 --> 00:23:41,839
there's something

468
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:42,880
I still need to bring up.

469
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,480
Now that Yuxin has moved in with me,

470
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,039
the surveillance on her

471
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:48,079
should be called off.

472
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:49,400
Well...

473
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,599
I only assigned people to protect her.

474
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,240
How did it become surveillance in your eyes?

475
00:23:53,359 --> 00:23:54,960
If she knew someone was protecting her,

476
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,640
she wouldn't have run off.

477
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,200
Are there protection measures

478
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,960
that the person being protected doesn't know about?

479
00:24:02,119 --> 00:24:02,920
Alright, alright.

480
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,200
Let's go see the director first.

481
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:10,880
Liang Shuo, oh Liang Shuo

482
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,519
What am I supposed to say to you?

483
00:24:15,839 --> 00:24:17,480
I failed to judge people correctly

484
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,599
and am willing to accept punishment

485
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,119
No need to apologize

486
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:22,440
If you really want to explain

487
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,279
go to the Central Executive Committee

488
00:24:24,279 --> 00:24:25,519
and explain to Mr. Zhou

489
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:26,680
Yes

490
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:27,599
Director

491
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,640
This really isn't Liang Shuo's fault

492
00:24:29,799 --> 00:24:32,000
That Zhao Di was newly transferred to the Operations Department

493
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,319
And he usually disguised himself

494
00:24:33,319 --> 00:24:34,559
as being extremely honest

495
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:36,079
Besides, before this happened

496
00:24:36,119 --> 00:24:37,319
if anyone said he was anti-Japanese

497
00:24:37,319 --> 00:24:38,400
no one would have believed it

498
00:24:38,599 --> 00:24:39,880
What about Mizuno Shingen?

499
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:42,599
Did he call you in for questioning?

500
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:43,880
Yes

501
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,640
Chief Mizuno

502
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,960
also asked about Zhao Di

503
00:24:47,079 --> 00:24:48,559
Other than Zhao Di, did he ask about anything else?

504
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,920
What the director wants to ask is

505
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,000
What I'm talking about is

506
00:24:56,359 --> 00:24:59,079
the annihilation of the Military Command at St. George's Church.

507
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:00,119
Mizuno

508
00:25:00,119 --> 00:25:01,440
did he mention it to you?

509
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,559
Chief Mizuno is very tight-lipped.

510
00:25:07,359 --> 00:25:09,119
That old fox

511
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:10,559
has always been like that.

512
00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:12,079
To be able to, in a single night,

513
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:13,559
wipe out the Military Command post in Shanghai

514
00:25:13,759 --> 00:25:15,319
it seems the intelligence Meihua Hall obtained

515
00:25:15,319 --> 00:25:16,319
is no small matter.

516
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,640
Wang Mutian is at least a major general,

517
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,240
yet he was turned so easily.

518
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:24,200
Director,

519
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,200
regarding this matter,

520
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,319
I have some thoughts.

521
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,319
Speak.

522
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:32,359
Intelligence capable of turning someone of Wang Mutian's rank

523
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:34,119
must have a significant source.

524
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,200
Seeing how at ease Mizuno Shingen is

525
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,640
shows that he still has

526
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,759
many more

527
00:25:39,759 --> 00:25:41,839
tricks up his sleeve against the anti-Japanese forces.

528
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:44,680
We are collaborating with the Japanese and Wang's regime.

529
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,559
With this kind of strategic intelligence,

530
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:49,200
is there any reason to keep it from us?

531
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,559
That bastard Mizuno Shingen

532
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,960
has such valuable intelligence

533
00:25:55,079 --> 00:25:56,200
but doesn't share it with us.

534
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,599
He lets us risk our lives at the front.

535
00:25:58,359 --> 00:25:58,799
Director,

536
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,839
he doesn't even see us as people.

537
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,279
You two

538
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:04,880
are both my trusted aides

539
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,480
and pillars of the Central Executive Committee.

540
00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:08,880
There are some things

541
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:10,920
that you should know as well.

542
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:16,960
Mr. Zhou suspects

543
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:19,559
the Japanese side has obtained important intelligence.

544
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,079
It is very likely

545
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:24,079
that it is a list of spies who have already defected to the Japanese.

546
00:26:24,599 --> 00:26:26,480
Many people on this list

547
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:28,440
may have already become

548
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:31,440
high-ranking officials within our organization and the Chongqing government.

549
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:32,599
Perhaps,

550
00:26:32,599 --> 00:26:33,519
there are also some

551
00:26:33,519 --> 00:26:36,200
who are Japanese agents that infiltrated the country early on.

552
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,279
This intelligence

553
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,920
can be used as leverage for political coercion.

554
00:26:40,319 --> 00:26:41,759
If this is true,

555
00:26:41,759 --> 00:26:45,880
then this is the Japanese side's

556
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,200
secret trump card for holding the peace conference.

557
00:26:51,559 --> 00:26:52,400
The list

558
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,880
If this list

559
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,200
is full of people like Wang Mutian

560
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,359
of that caliber

561
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,720
then this intelligence

562
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:02,799
for Mr. Wang

563
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:03,720
and for Nanjing

564
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,039
is also extremely significant

565
00:27:05,319 --> 00:27:06,319
Then I think

566
00:27:06,319 --> 00:27:08,960
we shouldn't let Mizuno Shingen monopolize it

567
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,000
But right now, this Mizuno

568
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:17,440
shows no intention of cooperating at all

569
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:21,599
However, today

570
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:25,480
Mizuno did mention something from ten years ago

571
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,079
Ten years ago

572
00:27:27,319 --> 00:27:29,799
at the Asai residence's intelligence agency

573
00:27:31,599 --> 00:27:32,319
That's right

574
00:27:32,519 --> 00:27:33,640
That piece of intelligence

575
00:27:34,079 --> 00:27:35,799
is related to someone named Asai Hisashi

576
00:27:35,799 --> 00:27:37,799
an old Japanese spy

577
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,160
Asai Hisashi

578
00:27:42,839 --> 00:27:43,559
Director

579
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:45,559
To be blunt

580
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,880
although we work closely with Japan

581
00:27:49,319 --> 00:27:50,920
in the end

582
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:53,519
we follow Mr. Wang's strategy of saving the country through compromise

583
00:27:54,119 --> 00:27:55,559
and naturally take the leader's will

584
00:27:55,559 --> 00:27:56,920
as our guiding principle

585
00:27:57,359 --> 00:27:59,079
We should take the initiative

586
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,480
Alright

587
00:28:02,359 --> 00:28:03,160
Very good

588
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,799
You have this determination

589
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,759
which means you haven't let down the party and the country for nurturing you

590
00:28:08,039 --> 00:28:09,079
It's just that

591
00:28:09,079 --> 00:28:11,079
I've already met with Mizuno Shingen

592
00:28:11,119 --> 00:28:12,839
Conventional methods

593
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,319
won't work

594
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,599
Since the usual methods aren't working,

595
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:20,880
then perhaps

596
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,440
we should try unconventional means

597
00:28:23,559 --> 00:28:24,680
to make the cooperation happen.

598
00:28:25,319 --> 00:28:26,400
Brother Liang is right.

599
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,200
We can't let Mizuno

600
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,480
lead us by the nose.

601
00:28:44,359 --> 00:28:45,039
Lao Wu

602
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,279
See for yourself.

603
00:28:52,119 --> 00:28:52,920
Accountability.

604
00:28:53,799 --> 00:28:55,519
The superiors don't trust us.

605
00:28:55,519 --> 00:28:57,119
It's not like this is the first time.

606
00:28:59,519 --> 00:29:01,119
This must be Mizuno's scheme.

607
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,559
He wants to

608
00:29:04,039 --> 00:29:05,960
let those traitors accuse us first.

609
00:29:06,359 --> 00:29:08,279
He wants to cut off our connection with Chongqing.

610
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:09,839
And completely sever Shanghai's support.

611
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,640
No matter how clearly we explain,

612
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:15,039
we still can't dispel their suspicions.

613
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,960
When has Dai Chunfeng ever truly helped us?

614
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:22,519
But without support from the rear,

615
00:29:22,839 --> 00:29:24,920
what about our plan to sabotage the Peace Conference?

616
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,839
We've been planning this for so long.

617
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:28,880
There's still hope.

618
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,759
If we find the list

619
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,039
and destroy it,

620
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,839
all our previous efforts

621
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,480
won't be in vain.

622
00:29:38,279 --> 00:29:39,759
But the price

623
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,359
is just too high.

624
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,880
This time, Mizuno Shingen

625
00:29:44,279 --> 00:29:45,279
has the upper hand.

626
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:49,119
But we haven't revealed our trump card yet.

627
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,759
Who will win in the end

628
00:29:52,279 --> 00:29:53,599
is still uncertain.

629
00:29:56,039 --> 00:29:57,759
The most urgent task right now

630
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,519
is to eliminate the traitor.

631
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,759
Wang Mutian was seriously injured by your shot.

632
00:30:02,319 --> 00:30:03,400
Now

633
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,240
he's still being treated at the Japanese Army Hospital.

634
00:30:06,279 --> 00:30:07,759
That guy won't live much longer.

635
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,079
Contact Lu Xijian immediately.

636
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:12,480
Cheng Chun

637
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,160
Call

638
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:19,920
Lao Wu.

639
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,480
Let me handle this.

640
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,720
Station Chief

641
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:36,039
Slow down, slow down, slow down.

642
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:08,880
Chief

643
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,239
It must be a wound from a cold weapon.

644
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:11,719
Like a short dagger.

645
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:13,920
It was a professional killer.

646
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:16,599
Yes.

647
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:38,280
We just raided them during the day,

648
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:41,119
and that very night they came to hunt down the traitor.

649
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:42,840
We really underestimated their abilities.

650
00:34:44,559 --> 00:34:47,360
I truly underestimated them.

651
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:50,880
Desperados really stop at nothing.

652
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:53,760
It seems as long as Station Chief Wang is alive,

653
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,039
they won't be able to sleep peacefully.

654
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:58,599
But as long as he dares to sneak into the hospital,

655
00:34:58,599 --> 00:35:00,440
he will definitely leave traces.

656
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,159
The lock on the small door of the hospital's south building

657
00:35:42,159 --> 00:35:43,760
was pried open with a sharp tool.

658
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:46,039
The doctor's office on the first floor was broken into.

659
00:35:46,039 --> 00:35:47,519
A set of uniforms was stolen.

660
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,000
The intruder

661
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,159
disguised themselves as a doctor and entered the ward.

662
00:35:51,159 --> 00:35:52,199
I asked Wang Mutian to work with the artist

663
00:35:52,199 --> 00:35:53,360
to create those portraits.

664
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,440
They're missing.

665
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:55,519
What?

666
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,000
Hello, Director.

667
00:36:37,679 --> 00:36:38,280
You...

668
00:36:39,159 --> 00:36:39,840
Director, reporting in.

669
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,159
My name is Zhao Di, I'm new here.

670
00:36:42,039 --> 00:36:42,840
Director, are you thirsty?

671
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:43,840
Let me refill your water.

672
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:45,639
I brought this for you.

673
00:36:46,119 --> 00:36:46,920
What is it?

674
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:47,719
Tiger Claws.

675
00:36:47,719 --> 00:36:48,760
A Shanghai specialty.

676
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:50,800
It's a bit greasy.

677
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:51,679
I don't have much of an appetite.

678
00:36:53,559 --> 00:36:54,280
Director.

679
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,119
Please try one.

680
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:56,280
Their family makes it especially tasty.

681
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,840
Having a young man like you serve me...

682
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,880
You're not used to it, are you?

683
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:08,119
Don't say that, Director.

684
00:37:08,519 --> 00:37:09,440
Being able to take care of you

685
00:37:09,639 --> 00:37:10,559
is my honor.

686
00:37:19,519 --> 00:37:21,880
Just now, Li Delun cornered me.

687
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,159
How did you respond?

688
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:25,440
Of course I said I was going with you.

689
00:37:25,679 --> 00:37:26,320
Boss.

690
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,960
Even though I was transferred from General Affairs,

691
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,239
I'm with you now.

692
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,599
I'm your person.

693
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,320
Why do you keep following me?

694
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,079
Since you saved me,

695
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,559
please show me the right path.

696
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:49,960
Who exactly are you?

697
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:51,880
You saved my life.

698
00:37:54,159 --> 00:37:55,239
Comrade Qingshuang.

699
00:37:55,719 --> 00:37:56,719
I'm your comrade-in-arms.

700
00:38:29,719 --> 00:38:31,599
You killed Wang Mutian.

701
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,840
I was just following orders from above.

702
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,519
Li Hanzhi let something slip.

703
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,760
Wang Mutian probably

704
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,000
betrayed us a long time ago.

705
00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:43,679
Maybe we can start from

706
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,599
Wang Mutian's network of contacts

707
00:38:45,639 --> 00:38:46,519
and find a breakthrough.

708
00:38:48,639 --> 00:38:50,119
I'm afraid that's like looking for a needle in a haystack.

709
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,320
You don't seem surprised at all.

710
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,679
You already knew, didn't you?

711
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:01,480
In my opinion,

712
00:39:02,119 --> 00:39:04,000
we can put the list aside for now.

713
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,119
What do you mean?

714
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,760
What's going on with Zhao Di?

715
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,800
I don't know what your relationship is with him,

716
00:39:15,159 --> 00:39:16,400
but I'm very sure

717
00:39:17,159 --> 00:39:18,840
he's definitely not with the military intelligence.

718
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:23,199
He's an informant I recruited.

719
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,079
An informant?

720
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,280
An informant would risk his life to save you?

721
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:32,119
Even at the cost of his own life?

722
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:36,320
That's because I once saved his life too.

723
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:38,880
When did you save him?

724
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:39,840
How did you save him?

725
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,039
Why did you save him?

726
00:39:42,559 --> 00:39:43,400
Lu Xijian,

727
00:39:44,519 --> 00:39:46,000
are you interrogating me?

728
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,440
I'm giving you a chance.

729
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,119
According to the rules of our profession,

730
00:39:52,559 --> 00:39:53,880
for safety's sake,

731
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,639
when I recruit informants,

732
00:39:55,639 --> 00:39:57,480
I don't need to report to you.

733
00:39:58,639 --> 00:39:59,639
Besides,

734
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,599
have you figured it out yet?

735
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,920
You're here to cooperate with me.

736
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,599
If I find out

737
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:16,000
someone is stabbing me in the back,

738
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,519
I won't hesitate to kill them first.
