1
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:00,680
Hello?

2
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,560
Mizuno.

3
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,560
Are you okay?

4
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,640
Asai-senpai.

5
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:09,040
Asai-senpai.

6
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,560
You've gotten yourself into big trouble.

7
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:12,040
Quick, trace the source of the call.

8
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,159
Trouble?

9
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:16,479
Compared to your situation, Mizuno,

10
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:19,719
aren't I in even worse shape?

11
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,439
Your name is already on the wanted list, Asai-senpai.

12
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,280
The military won't rest until they catch you.

13
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,879
Haven't we been working together pretty well?

14
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:30,639
Working together?

15
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,840
So far,

16
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:35,599
I haven't seen much sincerity from you, Mizuno,

17
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:37,120
not at all.

18
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,360
You know,

19
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:41,639
you've really underestimated me.

20
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:45,800
You should show more respect to your seniors, Mizuno.

21
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,479
Especially to someone

22
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:51,520
who's been in this business twenty years longer than you.

23
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,599
So, what do you want me to do?

24
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,520
Everyone's after the list,

25
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:00,159
but you still haven't caught them.

26
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:04,080
I'll find them for you.

27
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:07,199
How are you going to do that?

28
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:09,439
You don't need to worry about that.

29
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:12,319
If I can't,

30
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:15,560
I'll have to find a new partner.

31
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,319
Wait for my message.

32
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:20,319
I'll contact you again.

33
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,800
Hello? Hello?

34
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,479
All the brothers have spread out.

35
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:34,919
This big net has been cast.

36
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:36,159
He's alone and unarmed.

37
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:38,120
Even if he had superhuman abilities,

38
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,039
he still couldn't escape.

39
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,599
What he needs most right now is to rest and recover.

40
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,639
Only by narrowing the search area

41
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:45,000
do we have a chance of finding him.

42
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:46,599
How big can Hongkou be?

43
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:49,400
Even if I have to turn all of Hongkou upside down,

44
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,000
I'll still find him.

45
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,520
You're just being stubborn now.

46
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:01,759
Enough.

47
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:03,039
I'm going to get something to eat.

48
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:04,199
No matter what,

49
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,680
we should eat before getting back to work.

50
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,680
How did you know I was here?

51
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,399
I called and asked.

52
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:29,160
Scorpio came to the shop looking for me.

53
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,600
He wants you to track Asai Shou.

54
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:32,399
Find a chance to take him out.

55
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:33,839
It's too late.

56
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,399
I just got the news.

57
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,079
Asai Shou has escaped.

58
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,519
He got away.

59
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,040
Where did he go?

60
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,120
This guy is much harder to deal with than we thought.

61
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,040
He's experienced and skilled.

62
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,079
It's dangerous here.

63
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:48,160
You need to leave right away.

64
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,959
Share this news with Old Tan as well.

65
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,879
Tell him to add more patrols in the area.

66
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,639
Okay, I'll go right away.

67
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:56,839
Nian Ci.

68
00:04:58,519 --> 00:04:59,399
What else?

69
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:01,439
Be careful.

70
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:04,120
Got it.

71
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,439
You too.

72
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:22,839
Sir

73
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:24,759
Sir

74
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:26,279
Sir

75
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:27,800
You dropped your wallet.

76
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:30,120
Your wallet.

77
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:33,399
This is mine.

78
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,519
Thank you.

79
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,879
You're welcome.

80
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,399
Let's go.

81
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,040
You've seen it.

82
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:19,040
It's already been sent for analysis.

83
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,680
The results will be out soon.

84
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:22,399
The carotid artery was severed.

85
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:23,560
The wound is very clean.

86
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:24,879
The method is very professional.

87
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:27,920
To escape from Mizuno Shingen's men

88
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,319
he's certainly not ordinary.

89
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:31,399
Boss

90
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:32,600
The test results are out.

91
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,920
It should be potassium cyanide.

92
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,839
In such a short time

93
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:37,879
where did he get the poison?

94
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,800
If it were really that easy

95
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,480
he would have been caught already.

96
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,600
Then he wouldn't be Asai Hisashi.

97
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,959
About this matter

98
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,360
what do you all think?

99
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,480
To act when there are eyes everywhere

100
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,920
he has an extraordinary mind

101
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:03,240
and extraordinary abilities.

102
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,360
What do you mean?

103
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,680
He could have found a way to leave

104
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,120
but he deliberately stayed near Siming Alley.

105
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,160
He must have a special reason.

106
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,279
For the list.

107
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:15,360
But this list

108
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,040
was made by him in the first place.

109
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,720
He could have made a copy.

110
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,639
This probably isn't just a simple list.

111
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,839
It's actually a thick file.

112
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,439
In that file,

113
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,240
there is evidence for each

114
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,240
person who betrayed the people of Chongqing.

115
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,800
Otherwise, Asai Shou

116
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:31,720
wouldn't be able to use

117
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,480
just a simple list

118
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,720
to control these people.

119
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:37,199
So,

120
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:40,720
he's still holding something back from Mizuno Shingen.

121
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,920
Otherwise, he wouldn't have waited until now.

122
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:46,959
Actually, I've always had

123
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:48,680
an unrealistic idea.

124
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,399
It wasn't until yesterday

125
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:52,680
that I got a bit of confirmation.

126
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,360
Tell me about it.

127
00:07:57,279 --> 00:07:59,319
We underestimated Mizuno Shingen

128
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,879
and his relationship with Asai Hisashi.

129
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,360
We thought it was simpler than it is.

130
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,279
Mizuno Shingen was never

131
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:07,920
the one controlling the whole incident.

132
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:11,639
And Asai Hisashi's prison break wasn't an accident.

133
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:14,319
It seems more like it was long planned.

134
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:15,680
What do you mean?

135
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,160
Our actions accelerated

136
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,519
the breakdown of his relationship with Mizuno Shingen.

137
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,360
Nishima,

138
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:24,480
tell us about the clues you found at No. 76.

139
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,240
Go ahead.

140
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,000
According to the test results from No. 76,

141
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,959
Asai Hisashi used

142
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:34,199
a poisoned weapon during the murder.

143
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:35,439
Potassium cyanate.

144
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,839
Potassium cyanate.

145
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,559
This substance can be absorbed through the skin

146
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,399
and poison whoever handles it.

147
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,399
But the symptoms aren't too severe.

148
00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:46,840
Still, it's troublesome.

149
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:49,200
The poisoned person must use

150
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,679
diluted sodium thiosulfate

151
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,159
to wash and detoxify.

152
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,360
But this substance

153
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,879
is hard to find on the market now.

154
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,279
I don't think Asai Hisashi

155
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,120
would go to a chemical plant for it.

156
00:08:58,519 --> 00:09:00,120
Photographic fixer used in photo studios

157
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,879
has the same detoxifying effect.

158
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,600
And I've checked,

159
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,600
in this area

160
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:07,279
there's only one photo studio.

161
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,840
It's called Quanfulu Photo Studio.

162
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,759
You can go keep an eye on it first.

163
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,919
What I want is Asai Hisashi's people.

164
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,519
No matter what means you use.

165
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:24,879
The list he created.

166
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,120
The Japanese want it.

167
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:28,720
We must get it as well.

168
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:30,679
Director Liang.

169
00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:31,799
Doing this kind of work

170
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,200
is your specialty.

171
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,440
Time is tight.

172
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,039
Within one day

173
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,960
I want to see new progress.

174
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,320
I will do my best.

175
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:47,120
Lao Wu

176
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:48,159
Let's have a talk.

177
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:49,919
Talk about what?

178
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:51,919
Asai Shou

179
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,159
Actually, every move he makes

180
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:56,559
is carefully planned out.

181
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,960
In my opinion, potassium cyanide

182
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,080
doesn't seem like a clue.

183
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:01,879
It feels more like a trap.

184
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,159
Asai Shou knows very well

185
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,639
how many people

186
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,919
are watching the list in his hands.

187
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:09,879
What are you trying to say?

188
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,080
That my approach is wrong?

189
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,639
I'm just worried.

190
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:16,000
Worried that we've been noticed.

191
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,120
The operation

192
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,240
still has to go on.

193
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,000
Others may not understand,

194
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,240
but don't you know Asai Shou by now?

195
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,000
Seeing the way that Agent 76 died

196
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,879
reminds me of back then,

197
00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:30,919
when he was in Nanjing,

198
00:10:30,919 --> 00:10:32,879
and caused all that bloodshed.

199
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:35,000
Actually, you know better than I do.

200
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:35,720
Your big brother.

201
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,960
No need to remind me again.

202
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,960
This operation

203
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:40,759
cannot afford any mistakes.

204
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,320
Let Xie Nianci join as well.

205
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:45,759
Nianci.

206
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:48,279
Are you serious?

207
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:49,759
What's wrong?

208
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:51,720
Everyone else can join.

209
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,440
Why can't a child of the Xie family join?

210
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,360
Nianci is your own niece.

211
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,360
Liang Shuo and Lu Xijian said

212
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,200
Nianci is not allowed to participate in any operations.

213
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:05,840
Her life matters,

214
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,080
but so do the lives of my other students.

215
00:11:10,039 --> 00:11:11,679
You think I want this?

216
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:13,879
We're short on people.

217
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:16,279
One more person

218
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,519
means more strength.

219
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:22,240
Those kids in the special training class are pitiful.

220
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,360
You're really cold-blooded.

221
00:11:40,759 --> 00:11:41,600
Director.

222
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,120
Any progress?

223
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:44,919
Starting from the place where he killed,

224
00:11:44,919 --> 00:11:47,200
we conducted a search.

225
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:49,159
Three streets away,

226
00:11:49,159 --> 00:11:53,000
we found the San'an Pharmacy that Asai Shou had broken into.

227
00:11:55,039 --> 00:11:57,360
You might not really know this person.

228
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,399
He's far more

229
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,559
cunning and ruthless than you can imagine.

230
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,120
If you only follow the traces he left on purpose,

231
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,039
you might never catch him, not even in your next life.

232
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:17,679
Quanfu Road is here.

233
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:20,600
The pharmacy is there, which makes things interesting.

234
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,919
These are all places Mr. Asai used to know

235
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:24,519
so well in Shanghai that he could walk them with his eyes closed.

236
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,200
I've told you so much,

237
00:12:27,159 --> 00:12:29,320
haven't you noticed anything unusual about it?

238
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:33,639
Aren't you worried he might leave Shanghai?

239
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,440
What do you mean?

240
00:12:35,799 --> 00:12:38,080
He's already gotten weapons, ammunition, and cash.

241
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,840
If I were him, I'd get a car nearby

242
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:42,480
and leave Shanghai as soon as possible.

243
00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:43,840
Wouldn't you do the same?

244
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,519
He can't get away, can he?

245
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:52,039
Takagi.

246
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:54,399
Are you doubting my judgment?

247
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,799
Asai stayed in Hongkou

248
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:01,399
because of the San-ichi list, right?

249
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:02,440
What else could it be?

250
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:03,840
Alright, alright.

251
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:08,200
Guan Yu was trapped in Maicheng.

252
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:10,519
He waited anxiously.

253
00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:11,720
The tasks have been intense these days.

254
00:13:11,879 --> 00:13:13,480
I can't get out without a valid reason.

255
00:13:13,639 --> 00:13:14,799
I have to go back soon.

256
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,320
So what reason did you use to get out?

257
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,279
To deliver something to my girlfriend.

258
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:22,840
The photos have been developed.

259
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:23,679
Do you want to see them?

260
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:25,360
Of course I do.

261
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,080
Let me see.

262
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:34,879
It looks good like this.

263
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,440
As long as you like it.

264
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:39,440
I do.

265
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:46,440
Let's get to the main topic.

266
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,039
Lao Chen and his team

267
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:53,360
are near Quanfu Road

268
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:55,279
and have found information about Asai Shou.

269
00:13:55,679 --> 00:13:57,559
Scorpio, from some unknown source,

270
00:13:57,559 --> 00:13:58,879
also has a rough idea of the location.

271
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:00,080
They're planning to take action too.

272
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,840
Agents from No. 76 are also lying in ambush nearby.

273
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:06,000
Plus, Asai Shou's own people are there.

274
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,559
This could

275
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:09,879
be our last chance to seize the list.

276
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,240
Scorpio wants me to join this operation as well.

277
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,799
That's too risky.

278
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,799
We've done even riskier things

279
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,200
and made it through unscathed, haven't we?

280
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,039
I can finally do something

281
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:22,240
for the organization.

282
00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:23,320
Don't worry.

283
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,879
As soon as there's news about Asai Shou,

284
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:26,159
I'll let you know right away.

285
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:29,320
Don't try to talk me out of it.

286
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:31,799
Just like I once tried to persuade you to leave Shanghai.

287
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,559
We were born in this era.

288
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:34,799
We have a responsibility

289
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,440
to do what we believe we should.

290
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,639
Are you doing this for yourself

291
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:41,759
or for me?

292
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,440
I'll keep the photo.

293
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,799
I'll carry it with me always.

294
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:08,080
That list is everything he has.

295
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:10,600
The peace conference is about to begin.

296
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:14,320
How could he give it up so easily?

297
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,759
With all due respect,

298
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:22,000
how do we know this isn't just your excuse?

299
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:23,600
The 31 List

300
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,919
From start to finish, only you and Asai Hisashi have handled it.

301
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,919
Now he's run off.

302
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
You're putting all the blame on him.

303
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,759
If you had the list all along,

304
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:39,240
couldn't you just keep it for yourself now?

305
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:43,080
That possibility can't be ruled out.

306
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,159
Takagi.

307
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:48,519
You've overstepped your bounds.

308
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,720
I'm sorry.

309
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:54,399
That wasn't my own opinion.

310
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:58,240
Those were my uncle's exact words.

311
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:06,039
Very well.

312
00:16:06,039 --> 00:16:08,440
Please tell your uncle

313
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,919
that we're all in the same boat now.

314
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:14,320
If the 31 List is lost,

315
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,240
then together,

316
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,240
we'll all be dragged before a military tribunal.

317
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,679
Do you understand?

318
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:22,320
Yes.

319
00:16:22,759 --> 00:16:24,200
I'll get ready right away.

320
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,440
Also,

321
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,000
regarding Mr. Mizuno's words,

322
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:36,440
I will relay them faithfully.

323
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:52,679
All the roles are here.

324
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,080
The show is about to begin.

325
00:16:55,559 --> 00:16:57,000
You're following me again.

326
00:16:57,639 --> 00:16:59,039
What did you say to Nian Ci?

327
00:16:59,799 --> 00:17:00,720
It's none of your business.

328
00:17:01,879 --> 00:17:03,919
But I do have something to ask of you.

329
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,360
That's rare.

330
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,559
Let's hear it.

331
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:11,519
Old Xie let Nian Ci join this operation too.

332
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,880
No matter who among us survives,

333
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,960
we must keep her safe.

334
00:17:16,519 --> 00:17:17,319
Promise me.

335
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,240
You don't need to say that.

336
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,559
I would do it anyway.

337
00:17:22,519 --> 00:17:23,680
Alright, alright.

338
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,640
The storyteller's gavel signals the start.

339
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,519
The end of the story

340
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:31,680
is often bleak and desolate.

341
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,319
That won't happen to us.

342
00:17:35,359 --> 00:17:36,319
Maybe.

343
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,359
Just a few names in the annals of history.

344
00:17:40,599 --> 00:17:43,519
Countless desolate graves in Beiman.

345
00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:45,720
The land tilled by predecessors is reaped by those who come after.

346
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:49,480
Why talk about fierce struggles?

347
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,160
Nobody move.

348
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:53,640
Alright.

349
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,839
We're taking the shot.

350
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,039
Taking the shot.

351
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:22,559
Hot noodle soup

352
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:26,200
You two

353
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,160
Take care

354
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:29,000
Take care, okay

355
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,200
Thank you for your patronage

356
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,200
Noodle soup

357
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,240
Freshly cooked noodle soup

358
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:48,880
Noodle soup

359
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,119
One bowl, please

360
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,200
A hobby from my youth

361
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,680
Who would have thought it would come in handy now

362
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:58,720
Life is unpredictable

363
00:19:00,279 --> 00:19:02,599
Even Asai Shou probably never expected it

364
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:04,480
Ten years later

365
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,680
We would meet again like this

366
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,200
That's true

367
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:09,680
Around here

368
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,079
There's only one photo studio

369
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,559
What we need to do

370
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:14,039
Is just to wait and see

371
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:16,960
The most important thing is

372
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,960
He's different from the people who come here for photos

373
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:20,920
He has a clear purpose

374
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:24,160
He only needs the photographic paper for developing photos

375
00:19:25,279 --> 00:19:26,160
I think he

376
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,119
Will definitely come in disguise

377
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,039
Welcome

378
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,519
Noodle soup

379
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,440
Hot noodle soup

380
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,759
If I were him

381
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,480
I would definitely wait until

382
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,319
It's almost dark before making a move

383
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,599
One bowl of hot noodle soup, please

384
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,680
Hot noodle soup

385
00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:28,079
Lao Wu

386
00:20:28,839 --> 00:20:30,240
Look at that person in the distance

387
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,599
Could it be him

388
00:20:33,559 --> 00:20:35,319
It could be anyone

389
00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:37,720
It's too far

390
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,519
Can't see clearly

391
00:20:45,759 --> 00:20:46,640
Any leads?

392
00:20:46,759 --> 00:20:47,559
Not yet.

393
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,079
I'm worried Asai Hisashi will show up soon.

394
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,200
We need to hurry over and provide support.

395
00:21:11,799 --> 00:21:12,960
The Japanese arrived so quickly.

396
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,200
Maybe they've found Asai Hisashi's whereabouts.

397
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,119
It seems they're also heading toward Siming Alley.

398
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:30,759
Move out.

399
00:21:35,559 --> 00:21:36,720
The Japanese have blocked the road.

400
00:21:37,079 --> 00:21:38,000
Something's not right.

401
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,759
We need to find a way to warn them.

402
00:21:40,759 --> 00:21:41,960
I'll go inform Old Xie.

403
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:11,880
It's really him.

404
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,079
Take him alive.

405
00:22:13,079 --> 00:22:13,400
Okay.

406
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:18,519
Don't let him get away.

407
00:22:18,519 --> 00:22:19,440
Stop him.

408
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,680
Something's up. Follow me.

409
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,319
Yes.

410
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:39,960
Come in quickly.

411
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:43,880
Lao Xie.

412
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:44,920
This place has already been exposed.

413
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,039
We should retreat for now.

414
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:47,680
Lao Xie, what are you doing?

415
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,319
We can't let him get away.

416
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:49,039
You can't go out.

417
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:49,960
Don't block me.

418
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:50,839
You can't go out.

419
00:22:50,839 --> 00:22:52,240
We can't let him get away.

420
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,200
This is bad.

421
00:22:55,279 --> 00:22:56,799
A large number of Japanese military police have appeared at the end of the street.

422
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:57,720
They're coming this way.

423
00:22:58,880 --> 00:22:59,519
Lao Xie.

424
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,359
Don't hesitate.

425
00:23:00,359 --> 00:23:01,200
Retreat quickly.

426
00:23:02,279 --> 00:23:03,640
The Japanese are almost here.

427
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,759
What are you still hesitating for?

428
00:23:06,039 --> 00:23:07,039
Retreat through the back door.

429
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:08,319
Retreat.

430
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,279
Retreat.

431
00:23:12,519 --> 00:23:13,079
Nian Ci.

432
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:14,400
What are you doing?

433
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,480
Why aren't you leaving yet?

434
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,319
This place has been exposed.

435
00:23:16,319 --> 00:23:17,279
Liang Shuo still doesn't know.

436
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:18,279
I have to go inform him.

437
00:23:18,279 --> 00:23:18,799
No.

438
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:19,960
It's too dangerous outside.

439
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,079
You can't go out.

440
00:23:21,079 --> 00:23:21,720
Go.

441
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:22,640
I must go.

442
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:25,920
Sir.

443
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:27,519
You dropped your wallet.

444
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:29,839
Your wallet.

445
00:23:30,759 --> 00:23:31,559
Thank you.

446
00:23:32,279 --> 00:23:33,079
You're welcome.

447
00:23:55,759 --> 00:23:56,680
Rush in.

448
00:24:55,319 --> 00:24:56,079
Sir

449
00:24:56,279 --> 00:24:57,759
Bloodstains found

450
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,759
Then why aren't you chasing?

451
00:24:59,759 --> 00:25:00,519
Yes, sir

452
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,079
Hello, Hongguang Photo Studio.

453
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,480
Evacuate immediately.

454
00:25:46,279 --> 00:25:47,240
Understood.

455
00:25:47,599 --> 00:25:48,920
Where are you?

456
00:26:04,519 --> 00:26:05,680
Sir.

457
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,279
Every shop on this street

458
00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:14,960
must be checked one by one.

459
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,160
Don't miss a single one.

460
00:26:16,359 --> 00:26:16,839
Yes, sir.

461
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:18,599
Search for me.

462
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:24,039
Zhonghai.

463
00:26:24,039 --> 00:26:24,720
Something's up.

464
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,400
Look quickly.

465
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,160
Hai.

466
00:26:29,319 --> 00:26:30,359
There seems to be something going on.

467
00:26:30,359 --> 00:26:31,079
Look quickly.

468
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:33,119
Hurry.

469
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:33,720
Follow.

470
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,200
Go.

471
00:26:48,519 --> 00:26:48,920
Hurry.

472
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,240
Go.

473
00:27:01,599 --> 00:27:02,160
Go.

474
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:11,960
Go over there.

475
00:27:12,279 --> 00:27:12,720
Come with me.

476
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:24,799
Notify Lao Tan.

477
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,039
We've found traces of Asai Shou.

478
00:27:26,039 --> 00:27:26,519
Yes.

479
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:28,240
Go.

480
00:27:28,359 --> 00:27:28,839
Chase over there.

481
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:29,519
Go.

482
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,559
Nian Ci.

483
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:55,279
It's dangerous here.

484
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:56,240
Come back with me quickly.

485
00:27:56,319 --> 00:27:57,119
Nian Ci.

486
00:28:00,519 --> 00:28:01,720
This young lady

487
00:28:01,839 --> 00:28:03,160
What a coincidence

488
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,480
It seems we just met

489
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:07,960
Nian Ci

490
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:09,079
Asai Shou

491
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,559
Asai Shou

492
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,279
I remember you

493
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,519
We've met before

494
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:16,920
In Nanjing

495
00:28:18,119 --> 00:28:19,839
You’re with the Military Bureau, aren’t you?

496
00:28:20,839 --> 00:28:23,039
Mr. Asai, you have a good memory

497
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,200
Put down the gun

498
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,680
Let the young lady go first

499
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:25,720
Let the young lady go first

500
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,519
Let’s find a place to talk

501
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,440
You’ve always been interested in the list I have

502
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,519
You never forgot about it

503
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,319
You wanted to kill me back then

504
00:28:34,359 --> 00:28:35,240
This debt

505
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,839
Needs to be settled too

506
00:28:36,839 --> 00:28:37,559
Alright

507
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:38,640
Let her go first

508
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,960
Our new and old grudges

509
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:41,880
Will be settled together

510
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,039
Very well

511
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,359
Before that

512
00:28:44,519 --> 00:28:45,599
Send someone first

513
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:47,119
To take me out of Hongkou

514
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:49,240
The Japanese have already surrounded this place

515
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,839
You can’t escape

516
00:28:51,359 --> 00:28:53,200
Of course I can’t do it alone

517
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,559
But with your help, maybe I can

518
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,960
Since we’re old acquaintances

519
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,119
Then

520
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,640
Let’s find a place

521
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,880
To have a proper talk

522
00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:03,559
Why should we cooperate with you?

523
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:05,799
Nian Ci

524
00:29:06,039 --> 00:29:07,799
Do you have a choice?

525
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:13,160
Send someone to keep watch on the public phone booth on Quanfu Road.

526
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,960
I will set the time and place separately.

527
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,559
I advise you not to follow me.

528
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:23,400
Otherwise, you know what the consequences will be.

529
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,480
I've been waiting for you.

530
00:29:45,319 --> 00:29:46,519
Is there any news about Nian Ci?

531
00:29:47,599 --> 00:29:49,920
Mr. Liu still hasn't received a call from Asai Shou.

532
00:29:50,119 --> 00:29:51,319
I've made an estimate.

533
00:29:51,839 --> 00:29:52,839
He should still be

534
00:29:52,839 --> 00:29:54,720
within Mizuno Shingen's encirclement.

535
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,519
He can't escape this area.

536
00:29:57,279 --> 00:29:58,680
We need to be fully prepared.

537
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:59,079
Liang Shuo.

538
00:29:59,079 --> 00:30:00,599
We have to find a way

539
00:30:01,119 --> 00:30:02,720
to make sure she doesn't get hurt at all.

540
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,680
Do you understand?

541
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,400
Calm down.

542
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:07,920
Old Xie is still waiting for us.

543
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:28,359
The ends of the earth

544
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:31,960
and the corners of the sea

545
00:30:32,519 --> 00:30:39,559
searching and searching for a kindred spirit

546
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:41,359
Madam

547
00:30:41,359 --> 00:30:42,359
It's time to eat

548
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:44,880
What's that loud noise outside?

549
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:47,839
Madam

550
00:30:47,839 --> 00:30:48,720
Don't worry

551
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,799
This is Hongkou District

552
00:30:49,799 --> 00:30:50,680
It's the Japanese area

553
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,119
No one will come here to cause trouble

554
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,319
Sir will be off work soon

555
00:30:53,319 --> 00:30:54,480
He'll come pick us up together

556
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,400
We

557
00:30:56,039 --> 00:30:57,640
You interrupted me, how annoying

558
00:30:58,279 --> 00:31:03,240
We're of one mind

559
00:31:06,119 --> 00:31:07,079
We are military police

560
00:31:08,039 --> 00:31:09,559
We're on official duty

561
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,200
Hurry

562
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,160
Search carefully

563
00:31:14,279 --> 00:31:15,119
Madam

564
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,359
What are you doing?

565
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,559
We are officials' family members

566
00:31:21,559 --> 00:31:23,279
Do you know the No. 76 Special Agent Headquarters?

567
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:24,119
Don't move

568
00:31:25,799 --> 00:31:27,119
Madam

569
00:31:27,559 --> 00:31:29,039
Don't touch my things

570
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:30,559
Do you know who my husband is?

571
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:31,319
Let go

572
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,240
My husband is Cui Mo

573
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:34,640
Stay out of the way

574
00:31:39,079 --> 00:31:39,880
Madam

575
00:31:40,279 --> 00:31:41,039
Madam

576
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,640
You bunch of bastards

577
00:31:47,599 --> 00:31:49,640
My husband is Cramer

578
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:53,960
You bunch of bastards

579
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,559
Don't touch my things

580
00:31:58,880 --> 00:31:59,480
Madam

581
00:31:59,759 --> 00:32:00,119
Madam

582
00:32:00,119 --> 00:32:00,799
Wait for my husband

583
00:32:02,519 --> 00:32:03,559
Bastard

584
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,200
How dare you hit me

585
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:11,480
Madam

586
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:13,519
Madam

587
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,039
Madam

588
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:16,640
Madam, you can't be hurt

589
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,400
Madam

590
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,400
Madam

591
00:32:18,839 --> 00:32:20,000
Cramer

592
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,960
Madam, wake up

593
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:31,960
Chief

594
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:38,440
Chief Takagi sent your briefing

595
00:32:56,759 --> 00:32:58,000
Tell Takagi

596
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,319
Don't come back if you can't find them

597
00:32:59,559 --> 00:33:00,000
Understood

598
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:08,759
Hello, it's me.

599
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:10,160
Mr. Mizuno.

600
00:33:10,359 --> 00:33:11,440
Hello.

601
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:12,920
Mr. Asai.

602
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:15,720
Go check it out.

603
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:16,240
Understood.

604
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,759
I'm calling you again.

605
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:23,559
Keep your word.

606
00:33:24,079 --> 00:33:27,119
I've come to deliver you some news.

607
00:33:27,119 --> 00:33:30,200
Are you ready to be tested by me?

608
00:33:31,119 --> 00:33:34,559
Are you qualified to be my partner?

609
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:39,160
Mr. Asai, you really do keep your word.

610
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:40,759
Now is the time.

611
00:33:40,759 --> 00:33:43,079
Come find me.

612
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,319
Mr. Asai.

613
00:33:45,319 --> 00:33:47,559
If you have something to say, just say it.

614
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:52,240
Those who covet the list,

615
00:33:53,079 --> 00:33:56,480
where exactly are they hiding in Shanghai?

616
00:33:57,279 --> 00:34:00,559
Are you ready to catch them all at once?

617
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:03,599
It's time to reveal the answer.

618
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,799
Then I can't wait to receive this big gift.

619
00:34:05,799 --> 00:34:09,079
Prove that I'm your best choice.

620
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:10,920
It better be.

621
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,559
Don't make me wait too long.

622
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:21,480
I've found it.

623
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,079
It's in the Quanfulu area.

624
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:27,559
Hurry.

625
00:34:27,559 --> 00:34:28,800
Move! Move! Move!

626
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,440
Get out of the way, quickly!

627
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,239
Madam.

628
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,320
Madam! Madam!

629
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:46,800
Where is it?

630
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:47,639
Boss, over there.

631
00:34:48,039 --> 00:34:48,960
Move aside, move aside.

632
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,760
She was shot.

633
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:52,480
She's covered in blood.

634
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,239
There was an accident while investigating Asai Shou.

635
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:54,760
Boss.

636
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:55,320
What accident?

637
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:55,559
Boss.

638
00:34:55,559 --> 00:34:56,920
Why did you go to my place?

639
00:34:57,159 --> 00:34:58,239
Where is the patient's family?

640
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,000
I am.

641
00:34:59,079 --> 00:34:59,920
I am.

642
00:35:00,159 --> 00:35:01,039
Where is my wife?

643
00:35:01,239 --> 00:35:02,440
The child couldn't be saved.

644
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:03,800
The child?

645
00:35:04,559 --> 00:35:05,480
What child?

646
00:35:05,679 --> 00:35:06,639
Where is my wife?

647
00:35:06,679 --> 00:35:07,599
Your wife has a gunshot wound.

648
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:08,280
It caused organ rupture.

649
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,119
She's having massive bleeding now.

650
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:09,880
Her condition is very critical.

651
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,119
I don't want to hear this.

652
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,440
You bring my wife back.

653
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:12,639
Boss.

654
00:35:12,639 --> 00:35:13,519
If you don't save my wife,

655
00:35:13,519 --> 00:35:14,400
I'll kill you.

656
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:14,719
Boss.

657
00:35:14,719 --> 00:35:15,440
Save my wife.

658
00:35:15,519 --> 00:35:16,519
I'm begging you.

659
00:35:16,519 --> 00:35:17,280
Please, I'm begging you.

660
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,840
Chief Cui, Chief Cui.

661
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,159
There's a call for you.

662
00:35:21,559 --> 00:35:22,719
Are you blind?

663
00:35:22,719 --> 00:35:23,559
Why are you shouting?

664
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:24,800
Get lost, now.

665
00:37:17,719 --> 00:37:19,400
I just received the news.

666
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,239
I'm sorry.

667
00:37:26,039 --> 00:37:27,719
I couldn't even protect her.

668
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:31,440
Am I useless?

669
00:37:38,199 --> 00:37:40,360
I called the Executive Committee.

670
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:42,519
Police Affairs Division.

671
00:37:44,119 --> 00:37:45,599
Changgwang Jie Zhi.

672
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,639
A major.

673
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,719
They said there will be strict punishment within the team.

674
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,119
Punishment.

675
00:38:08,639 --> 00:38:10,280
My wife is gone.

676
00:38:13,039 --> 00:38:14,159
In her belly,

677
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,679
was my child.

678
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,719
I did so much for them.

679
00:38:22,159 --> 00:38:24,039
I killed so many people.

680
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,039
All I wanted was to

681
00:38:27,039 --> 00:38:28,880
live a good life with her.

682
00:38:37,039 --> 00:38:38,519
Why?

683
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,199
Come in.

684
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,119
Director Liang.

685
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,239
Stay here and take good care of the director.

686
00:39:00,679 --> 00:39:02,360
Assign people to watch him 24 hours a day.

687
00:39:02,719 --> 00:39:03,960
Don't let anything happen to him.

688
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:04,800
Understood?

689
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:07,719
Tonghai.

690
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,400
If anything comes up in your department, you handle it first.

691
00:39:10,559 --> 00:39:11,079
Yes.

692
00:39:11,079 --> 00:39:11,840
You may go.

693
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,679
Brother Cui.

694
00:39:28,119 --> 00:39:29,639
I'll talk to Director Li.

695
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,239
I'll ask for you to have a couple more days off.

696
00:39:34,159 --> 00:39:35,440
Don't worry.

697
00:39:38,679 --> 00:39:41,239
I'll make sure the Military Police give you an explanation.

698
00:39:48,599 --> 00:39:49,360
Comrades.

699
00:39:49,519 --> 00:39:51,000
Today is an emergency meeting.

700
00:39:51,159 --> 00:39:52,800
There will be important assignments soon.

701
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:55,679
Sir has arrived.

702
00:40:01,679 --> 00:40:02,440
Is everyone here?

703
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,920
All the representatives from various sectors have arrived.

704
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:04,760
Alright, please have a seat.

705
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:05,400
Okay.

706
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:10,920
Comrades,

707
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,559
Time is tight.

708
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:13,719
So I'll

709
00:40:13,719 --> 00:40:14,800
keep it brief.

710
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,199
The organization needs us

711
00:40:17,199 --> 00:40:18,239
to unite and cooperate.

712
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,000
Tomorrow,

713
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,320
on Quanfulu,

714
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,119
Baota Street,

715
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,360
and the Yanhe Lane area,

716
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:24,840
we will mobilize our worker friends

717
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:27,239
to hold a demonstration against the Peace Conference.

718
00:40:28,519 --> 00:40:29,400
Sir,

719
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:30,599
about the timing,

720
00:40:30,639 --> 00:40:32,199
isn't it a bit rushed?

721
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,000
We don't have any issues with it.

722
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,559
The organization has arranged for us

723
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:37,800
to demonstrate on the day of the Peace Conference.

724
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,159
to hold a protest march.

725
00:40:39,199 --> 00:40:40,039
Preparations

726
00:40:40,039 --> 00:40:41,159
are already complete.

727
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,159
It's just that

728
00:40:42,159 --> 00:40:43,800
we need to notify everyone in a bit.

729
00:40:44,679 --> 00:40:45,800
We'll also do our best

730
00:40:46,239 --> 00:40:48,119
but things like banners and slogans

731
00:40:48,119 --> 00:40:49,440
might not be ready in time.

732
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,400
As long as the organization needs it,

733
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,719
we will definitely overcome any difficulties.

734
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,119
Alright.

735
00:40:54,199 --> 00:40:54,960
I understand

736
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,360
that this arrangement

737
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,679
puts everyone in a difficult position.

738
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,119
On behalf of the organization,

739
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,280
I thank you all for your understanding and support.

740
00:41:06,599 --> 00:41:07,320
Old Tan

741
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:11,000
Why do we need to start the demonstration early?

742
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,039
We've received a message from Comrade Qingshuang.

743
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:15,679
Asai Shou

744
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,199
plans to use the list and hostages

745
00:41:17,199 --> 00:41:18,119
as bait

746
00:41:18,519 --> 00:41:19,480
to catch us

747
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,840
and wipe out the remaining Military Command agents in one go.

748
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:23,039
But

749
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,440
we still don't know the exact location.

750
00:41:26,039 --> 00:41:27,039
The demonstration

751
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,960
can disrupt their plans.

752
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,599
We need to inform our student representatives

753
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,920
to adjust the march route at any time.

754
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,119
We can only

755
00:41:34,119 --> 00:41:35,840
stir up the waters in this pond

756
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,400
so that Comrade Qingshuang

757
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:39,119
has a chance to get out safely.
