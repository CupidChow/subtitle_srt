1
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,439
Stop, stop, stop.

2
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:52,719
It was lively just now.

3
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,400
Why did it suddenly get so quiet?

4
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,359
You two.

5
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:56,200
Go over and check it out.

6
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,040
Don't move.

7
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:00,959
Hands up.

8
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:01,719
Hands up.

9
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:23,000
Sir.

10
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:24,000
Go straight at the intersection ahead.

11
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,319
That's St. George's Lutheran Church.

12
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,039
Don't go straight.

13
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:33,000
Circle around first.

14
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:34,120
Yes.

15
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:46,560
Crows don't roost at night.

16
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,879
That's not a good sign.

17
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,159
Everyone, don't panic.

18
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,280
Return to your seats.

19
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,240
What are you doing?

20
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:54,159
Mr. Mizuno.

21
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:56,199
Restore the lights quickly.

22
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:58,400
Seal off the scene.

23
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,319
Everyone, stay calm.

24
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:04,479
It's just a minor issue.

25
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:06,639
It seems the infiltrator among us

26
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:08,039
couldn't resist making a move.

27
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,120
It's alright.

28
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,039
We'll know soon enough

29
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:13,280
who they really are.

30
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:26,000
Zhao Di, Zhao Di!

31
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,080
Zhao Di, what are you doing?

32
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:33,319
Boss!

33
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:34,080
Be careful!

34
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,240
Catch him!

35
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:49,759
Yes!

36
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:11,199
Check everyone at the scene immediately.

37
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:13,560
Focus on identifying uninvited people.

38
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,560
Understood.

39
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:30,879
Who are you, really?

40
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,480
As I thought, you really don't remember.

41
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,600
You once saved my life.

42
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,639
Comrade Qingshuang,

43
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,040
I am your comrade-in-arms.

44
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,600
Ever since you returned from Yulong Mountain,

45
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,000
I've noticed something was off about you.

46
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,360
If it weren't for

47
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:49,040
the urgency of this situation,

48
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,000
and your instructions,

49
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,319
I wouldn't have come to meet you.

50
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,600
What else did I have you do?

51
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,720
Monitor the Plum Blossom Hall.

52
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,879
When I was in the General Affairs Office,

53
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:56,879
I had access to many

54
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:58,600
documents and correspondence with the Plum Blossom Hall.

55
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,399
After I came to your side,

56
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,199
I've actually been hinting to you all along.

57
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,160
But I never got any response.

58
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:08,439
So that's how it is.

59
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:25,519
Sir,

60
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:26,759
it's already the appointed time.

61
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:27,600
What should we do?

62
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:32,639
Drive over.

63
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,519
Yes.

64
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,759
Our main target for tonight has arrived.

65
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:04,839
Something's wrong.

66
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:06,000
Stop the car.

67
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,680
Reverse.

68
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:18,759
Damn it.

69
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,079
Block him.

70
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:27,439
Reverse quickly!

71
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,360
Capture alive if possible.

72
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,199
But

73
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:01,439
in extreme situations,

74
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:02,519
you may act at your own discretion.

75
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:03,199
Understood.

76
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,600
Teacher.

77
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,360
Hurry, go!

78
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,240
Chengchun!

79
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,519
Come here, quickly!

80
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:41,879
Chengchun!

81
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,199
Come here, quickly!

82
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:46,680
Go!

83
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:48,279
Bastard!

84
00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:50,040
How dare you disobey orders!

85
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,879
The wounds they cut open

86
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,080
bleed like a spring.

87
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,039
The wounds they cut open

88
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:51,720
bleed like a spring.

89
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:53,480
are like a net

90
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,120
that has already been spread.

91
00:08:55,799 --> 00:08:57,879
The struggle of the bird

92
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,639
is all in vain.

93
00:09:00,759 --> 00:09:02,600
All their scheming

94
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,559
is in vain.

95
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:07,480
The struggle of the bird

96
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,559
cannot escape this cage.

97
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,000
Chief

98
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,600
Stop calling me Chief.

99
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:26,879
It's on fire.

100
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:27,759
This is...

101
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:28,960
What's going on?

102
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:30,320
What happened?

103
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,279
Look.

104
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:32,639
That's a lot of smoke.

105
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,080
I told you all before,

106
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:38,000
tonight's banquet is a grand event.

107
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:40,159
So it really is Takagi Yuyi.

108
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:40,840
Takagi Yuyi

109
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,519
is the one carrying out tonight's operation.

110
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,360
Mizuno was afraid of information leaking,

111
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,200
so he locked all of us

112
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:48,039
inside the Asai residence.

113
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,879
I'm afraid things don't look good for the Shanghai station this time.

114
00:10:51,879 --> 00:10:53,039
To eliminate those hiding in Shanghai,

115
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:54,279
all the undercover agents,

116
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,519
just now, in the chaos,

117
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,840
our undercover agent couldn't hold back and took action.

118
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:01,080
Although we've already taken him down,

119
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,799
I believe this person

120
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:03,799
wasn't acting alone.

121
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:06,639
But it doesn't matter.

122
00:11:06,919 --> 00:11:09,000
I've already destroyed your foundation.

123
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:11,720
I have plenty of patience.

124
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,480
I will make sure to settle this score.

125
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,399
Yes.

126
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:21,120
Everyone, gather in the main hall on the first floor.

127
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,480
Hurry!

128
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:25,200
Move quickly!

129
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:25,799
Hurry!

130
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:28,240
Move quickly!

131
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:32,559
Hurry!

132
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,759
Director Wang

133
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:39,080
To be able to treat former colleagues

134
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,960
so ruthlessly,

135
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,159
it shows

136
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:45,039
your determination to switch sides is quite strong.

137
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:48,159
I hope that in our future cooperation

138
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:50,559
things will be as pleasant as today.

139
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,039
With Mr. Takagi's kind words,

140
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,039
our cooperation will surely be enjoyable.

141
00:11:58,159 --> 00:11:58,759
Sir,

142
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,120
the big fish was already in the net,

143
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,399
but unexpectedly, someone picked him up by car at the last moment.

144
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:03,919
I'm truly sorry.

145
00:12:04,039 --> 00:12:04,519
However,

146
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:05,960
their car broke down.

147
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,200
They couldn't have gone far.

148
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,399
Although we destroyed

149
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,200
the Shanghai station and Scorpio's subordinates in one move,

150
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:15,799
the most crucial person

151
00:12:15,879 --> 00:12:18,120
still wasn't dealt with immediately.

152
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:19,759
You let Scorpio escape.

153
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:21,960
He will become a big problem for us.

154
00:12:22,759 --> 00:12:23,759
A big problem?

155
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:26,240
Do you think, alone in Shanghai,

156
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,360
he can stir up any trouble?

157
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,360
You don't understand him.

158
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,600
He always seeks revenge for the slightest grievance.

159
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,399
Where did he go?

160
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:31,120
We must

161
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,360
capture him immediately.

162
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,519
I've already sent people after him.

163
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,960
Director Wang,

164
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,480
there's no need to be so nervous.

165
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:43,919
How did one slip through the net?

166
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:48,639
Taikun, Taikun!

167
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:50,080
I'm one of us, Taikun!

168
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,440
One of us, Taikun!

169
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,279
Takagi-kun.

170
00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:53,519
He's with me.

171
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,480
Since we've already decided to serve the Empire,

172
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:59,639
please don't question our loyalty.

173
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,360
If it weren't for the chief

174
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,279
specifically asking to protect these two useless ones,

175
00:13:06,679 --> 00:13:07,639
people like this

176
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:09,799
I really don't know what use they are.

177
00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:11,879
Fine, fine.

178
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,320
Alright, alright, alright.

179
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:15,600
Okay.

180
00:13:24,039 --> 00:13:25,840
This Japanese agent, Black Fox,

181
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,840
has already secretly turned many people.

182
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:30,000
If it weren't for the commander of the 17th Division

183
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,919
and the exposure of Huang Kangnian's case,

184
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,080
we'd still be in the dark.

185
00:13:36,759 --> 00:13:38,559
I want you, no matter the cost,

186
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,840
to catch this Black Fox.

187
00:13:42,919 --> 00:13:44,799
You can beat me to death,

188
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:47,480
but your big brother won't come back.

189
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:50,559
Maybe

190
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,879
we can make a deal.

191
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,480
Up ahead.

192
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,840
Don't let him get away.

193
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,759
In the janitor's closet, on the utility cart,

194
00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:36,159
the identity of the body found has been confirmed.

195
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:37,480
He was from the Agent Headquarters No. 76,

196
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,720
the security guard Hu Qingmin.

197
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:41,080
He died from a stab wound to the chest.

198
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,559
The murder weapon has also been found.

199
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:45,720
It was on the attacker from earlier.

200
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,600
A murdered security guard—

201
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,360
with his status,

202
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,879
he definitely wasn't on the guest list.

203
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:54,200
This has also been verified.

204
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,720
This person knocked out a janitor

205
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,120
and snuck in.

206
00:14:57,399 --> 00:14:59,159
He even greeted the guards.

207
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:00,639
He can speak Japanese.

208
00:15:01,159 --> 00:15:02,559
Before his death, Hirata

209
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,559
had planted an undercover agent at headquarters.

210
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:05,320
Unfortunately,

211
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:06,440
they only had one-way contact.

212
00:15:06,759 --> 00:15:08,240
It's very likely

213
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,200
that this is the person.

214
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:11,399
Is there anything else?

215
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:14,080
The identity of the person who shot at you has also been confirmed.

216
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:17,000
The suspicious points from previous incidents

217
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,120
are also matching up one by one.

218
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,360
So we can confirm

219
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,799
whether this is the long-standing

220
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:22,159
mole.

221
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,600
Up to now,

222
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,720
what percentage of the suspicious points have been clarified?

223
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:28,399
Sixty percent so far.

224
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:29,840
And it's increasing.

225
00:15:30,039 --> 00:15:31,480
What I'm worried about now is,

226
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:34,440
even if you reach one hundred percent,

227
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,759
this problem will still exist.

228
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,840
Why is that?

229
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:59,200
Because I still haven't figured it out

230
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,639
why he would shoot at me

231
00:16:01,559 --> 00:16:04,200
under those circumstances.

232
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:07,120
Are you saying

233
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:10,679
that killing

234
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,120
is the simplest

235
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,399
act for an agent?

236
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,879
All he would have to consider are

237
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,000
the environment,

238
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,080
the route,

239
00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:20,279
the distance,

240
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:21,919
and other important factors like these.

241
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:23,639
Suppose

242
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:27,159
Zhao Di really wanted to assassinate me,

243
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:28,600
when we were

244
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,759
on the terrace,

245
00:16:30,759 --> 00:16:32,080
there were plenty of opportunities.

246
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,840
Why didn't he shoot then?

247
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,320
Could it be that the assassination target

248
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,080
wasn't you, sir?

249
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,480
If that's the case,

250
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,679
then what was his motive?

251
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,759
It seems our focus can't

252
00:16:48,519 --> 00:16:49,559
be only on

253
00:16:49,639 --> 00:16:51,320
that dead anti-Japanese member.

254
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:53,799
Yes, sir.

255
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,080
I understand.

256
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,159
Excuse me.

257
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,039
Chief,

258
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,799
Director Li is on the phone.

259
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,279
He says he is dissatisfied

260
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:03,320
with our unauthorized detention

261
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,640
of Special Agent Headquarters personnel

262
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,680
and protests against it.

263
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:12,920
Let him know we caught the infiltrator.

264
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:13,880
As for me,

265
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,920
I just want to see how he reacts.

266
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:16,799
Understood.

267
00:17:48,759 --> 00:17:49,680
Why is it you?

268
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:50,400
Hurry, go!

269
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:54,319
Take cover!

270
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,400
Have you seen Gu Chengchun?

271
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,240
He went to look for you.

272
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:11,960
Where is he?

273
00:18:14,279 --> 00:18:15,519
Say something, Lao Xie.

274
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:18,799
He died for the country.

275
00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:24,920
Lao Wu.

276
00:18:27,079 --> 00:18:27,880
Lao Wu.

277
00:18:28,039 --> 00:18:29,319
The people outside have been dealt with.

278
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,519
There's a place up ahead.

279
00:18:30,519 --> 00:18:31,839
It's our contact point.

280
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:32,759
Everyone, follow me.

281
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,200
Let's go.

282
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:35,000
Go.

283
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:40,680
Miss Jiang.

284
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:41,839
About what happened today,

285
00:18:41,839 --> 00:18:43,200
I apologize to you on behalf of Lao Xie.

286
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,240
Check the weapons and ammunition.

287
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:45,160
Reporting, sir.

288
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,079
We are carrying

289
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:47,119
one sniper rifle

290
00:18:47,119 --> 00:18:48,680
and its backup gun and ammunition.

291
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,759
Almost all used up.

292
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:50,839
Lao Xie.

293
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,599
Count the number of people.

294
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,519
Reporting, sir.

295
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,519
Operational personnel

296
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:55,759
only seven left.

297
00:18:56,119 --> 00:18:56,920
Lao Wu.

298
00:18:57,599 --> 00:18:58,440
Plan the route.

299
00:18:58,799 --> 00:18:59,759
Xie Jun'an.

300
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,359
As your inspector,

301
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,440
I have the right to know what exactly happened.

302
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:05,759
What happened with the fire at St. John's Church?

303
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:07,319
And how did Gu Chengchun die?

304
00:19:07,319 --> 00:19:09,200
I need to sort things out.

305
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:15,799
Lao Wu

306
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:17,039
I know

307
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:19,240
You're deeply saddened by Xiao Gu's death

308
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:21,359
But this isn't your area of expertise

309
00:19:21,799 --> 00:19:23,400
Near the St. Jude's Church on Xiao Qiao Road

310
00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:25,039
The roads are crisscrossed

311
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:25,960
It's easy to advance or retreat

312
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,359
Even if our operation plan was leaked

313
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,599
most of us

314
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,240
could still have gotten out safely

315
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,039
Gotten out safely?

316
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:37,880
They're dead

317
00:19:40,599 --> 00:19:42,079
They're all dead

318
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:43,920
What are you talking about?

319
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,640
How do you know?

320
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:47,720
Lao Wu

321
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,359
Explain yourself

322
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,799
Someone leaked the secret

323
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:56,960
The Japanese had already set up an ambush near the church

324
00:19:57,359 --> 00:20:00,000
They definitely didn't get the intel at the last minute

325
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,039
They were prepared in advance

326
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,400
The Shanghai office called again to urge us

327
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:07,119
Said the meeting point would be signaled by fireworks

328
00:20:07,319 --> 00:20:08,680
Why make such a big show?

329
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,720
Do they want to attract attention?

330
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:19,720
It was Wang Mutian

331
00:20:21,799 --> 00:20:22,559
Wang Mutian

332
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,119
Before the operation, he kept looking for people

333
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:26,519
and urging them to come

334
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:30,559
And he used fireworks as a last-minute signal

335
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:35,559
Those fireworks weren't for us

336
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,359
They were for the Japanese

337
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,839
If you want to know the truth

338
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,640
just listen to me

339
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:51,799
Teacher

340
00:20:52,599 --> 00:20:54,000
Enemy spotted at the southeast corner

341
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:55,119
Get ready to move

342
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,799
All past grudges are written off.

343
00:21:03,319 --> 00:21:04,319
After this matter,

344
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:06,240
we'll owe each other nothing.

345
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,119
You think I care about that?

346
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:36,279
Mizuno's adjutant is here.

347
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:44,759
Director Liang.

348
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,440
Chief Mizuno wants to see you.

349
00:21:46,519 --> 00:21:47,720
Please come with us.

350
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:48,640
Alright.

351
00:21:49,119 --> 00:21:49,960
Wait, boss!

352
00:21:51,079 --> 00:21:52,480
Why are you arresting our boss?

353
00:21:54,599 --> 00:21:55,279
Shut up.

354
00:21:56,039 --> 00:21:56,759
Step back.

355
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:58,920
Everyone,

356
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,519
before the investigation results come out,

357
00:22:02,519 --> 00:22:03,559
we apologize for any offense.

358
00:22:06,279 --> 00:22:07,000
Director Liang.

359
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:07,640
Please.

360
00:22:14,119 --> 00:22:14,759
No, wait—

361
00:22:14,759 --> 00:22:15,720
Captain, they've taken him!

362
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,839
Why aren't you doing something?

363
00:22:17,079 --> 00:22:18,400
Keep your voice down, we're in the Japanese area.

364
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:18,960
Now's not the time for that.

365
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,000
He's already been taken away.

366
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:20,839
And you still want us to keep quiet?

367
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:22,839
We've already lost Zhao Di.

368
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,960
Are you really our captain?

369
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:26,759
How can you be so cowardly?

370
00:22:26,759 --> 00:22:27,640
Wait until he comes down.

371
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,240
Enough.

372
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,359
Alright, brothers.

373
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,720
Calm down.

374
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,319
Zhao Di was Director Liang's direct subordinate.

375
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,960
It's normal for him to be taken for investigation.

376
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:37,960
Director Lu is right.

377
00:22:38,759 --> 00:22:39,720
Everyone, quiet down.

378
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,440
Hurry, hurry.

379
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:07,720
Alright.

380
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,680
Notify them.

381
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,160
Retreat.

382
00:24:11,079 --> 00:24:11,559
Retreat.

383
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,559
I really didn't expect this.

384
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,759
Even at such a disadvantage,

385
00:24:54,759 --> 00:24:56,319
they were still able to counterattack.

386
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,480
Sir,

387
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,319
they've already escaped far away.

388
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:03,680
Reporting, sir.

389
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,640
We found Chinese markings here.

390
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:16,799
Wang Mutian.

391
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,079
It really is him.

392
00:25:30,359 --> 00:25:34,599
First eliminate the traitor, then kill the Japanese invaders.

393
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,599
I've said all along that this person isn't easy to deal with.

394
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:51,079
I demand that you fulfill your promise to me immediately.

395
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,319
Within two days,

396
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:53,880
I want to be on a plane to Hong Kong.

397
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,400
I don't want to be involved in anything after that.

398
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,480
And I won't get involved again.

399
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,039
That's fine.

400
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,640
After all, Mr. Wang is as timid as a mouse.

401
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,400
Someone come.

402
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:03,960
Prepare a car and send him off.

403
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:04,599
Yes, sir.

404
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,200
As you wish.

405
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,480
Be on guard.

406
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,640
Be on guard.

407
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,119
Be on guard.

408
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,160
Where did that gunfire come from?

409
00:26:38,279 --> 00:26:39,359
Director Liang

410
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,359
Are you suspecting me, Chief?

411
00:26:44,839 --> 00:26:46,680
If I were in cahoots with Zhao Di,

412
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,880
I should have acted with him just now.

413
00:26:49,319 --> 00:26:51,000
I wouldn't be standing here now

414
00:26:51,119 --> 00:26:52,839
answering your questions.

415
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,000
Is that so?

416
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,799
Zhao Di has only been transferred to be my subordinate for less than half a month.

417
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:05,599
The appointment document was signed by Director Li.

418
00:27:05,839 --> 00:27:06,960
This seems more like

419
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,960
Director Li sent him to keep an eye on me.

420
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,400
If you want to investigate,

421
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:12,799
you should start with this lead.

422
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:13,839
Shouldn't you?

423
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,279
As far as I know,

424
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,160
Zhao Di was near you at the time.

425
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:22,200
I want to know

426
00:27:22,839 --> 00:27:24,279
what you were doing then.

427
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:26,640
I crouched down and covered my head.

428
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:28,480
I kept my distance from him.

429
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:32,319
As a security officer for the new government,

430
00:27:34,359 --> 00:27:35,599
your reaction at that moment

431
00:27:36,519 --> 00:27:37,799
was very disappointing to me.

432
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:41,000
When we entered the residence,

433
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,079
our firearms were confiscated.

434
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,400
The Chongqing agents had guns.

435
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:49,640
When the shots were fired, my first instinct was to protect myself.

436
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,160
Frankly speaking,

437
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,279
that's everyone's instinct.

438
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,359
I don't

439
00:27:55,359 --> 00:27:56,359
feel ashamed of it.

440
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:04,119
Director Liang

441
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,960
I appreciate your honesty.

442
00:28:08,279 --> 00:28:10,200
I don't mean to blame you.

443
00:28:11,079 --> 00:28:12,920
I just want to discuss with you

444
00:28:13,119 --> 00:28:15,079
another strange incident

445
00:28:15,079 --> 00:28:16,799
that happened at the same time.

446
00:28:17,079 --> 00:28:17,960
This matter

447
00:28:18,319 --> 00:28:20,359
might be clearer to you, Director Liang.

448
00:28:26,839 --> 00:28:28,920
I don't quite understand what Chief Mizuno means.

449
00:28:29,799 --> 00:28:31,680
Then let me make it clearer.

450
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,599
Right when you suggested we have a drink together,

451
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,960
the lighting circuit on the terrace roof

452
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,960
was cut by someone.

453
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,359
Don't you think that's a bit too much of a coincidence?

454
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:43,960
Maybe Zhao Di

455
00:28:44,279 --> 00:28:46,200
just happened to take advantage of that.

456
00:28:46,359 --> 00:28:47,799
Zhao Di was alone.

457
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,839
And right at the scene,

458
00:28:49,839 --> 00:28:50,480
at the same time,

459
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:53,680
the guiding light next to the mansion also suddenly failed.

460
00:28:55,559 --> 00:28:56,839
According to the investigation,

461
00:28:56,839 --> 00:28:58,319
that was also caused by human interference.

462
00:28:58,839 --> 00:29:00,000
It's obvious

463
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,480
that Zhao Di couldn't have done all this alone.

464
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03,640
I believe

465
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,000
he has other accomplices.

466
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:08,559
So, Mr. Mizuno,

467
00:29:08,759 --> 00:29:10,599
you think this matter is related to me?

468
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,119
You are one of the security chiefs for the Peace Conference.

469
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,799
If you don't have enough

470
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:22,799
evidence to convince me with your investigation results,

471
00:29:23,359 --> 00:29:24,839
then I can only remove you

472
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,920
from the Peace Conference security team.

473
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:31,839
I also have to give an explanation to the new government.

474
00:29:32,519 --> 00:29:33,519
As for this decision,

475
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,880
I suggest, Mr. Mizuno,

476
00:29:36,279 --> 00:29:38,119
that it be handled by the executive committee.

477
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,799
As long as the central committee and the executive committee approve,

478
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:43,720
I will comply with any decision from my superiors.

479
00:29:45,559 --> 00:29:47,000
Let's leave today's matter

480
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:48,799
at that for now.

481
00:29:49,559 --> 00:29:50,640
We'll talk about it another day.

482
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,640
As long as Chief Mizuno needs me,

483
00:29:53,119 --> 00:29:54,319
I can come over at any time.

484
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:01,960
Sir

485
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,920
The surroundings are all set up like this.

486
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,799
Is there really no one around here?

487
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:09,240
The area around here is all shantytowns.

488
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,480
The anti-Japanese elements have all disappeared.

489
00:30:12,039 --> 00:30:13,759
They're too cunning.

490
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,920
How is Wang Mutian?

491
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,559
The bullet went through his right arm.

492
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:21,319
It entered his chest cavity.

493
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,680
Even if he survives,

494
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,680
he'll be a cripple.

495
00:30:24,599 --> 00:30:25,799
That shot was really vicious.

496
00:30:26,119 --> 00:30:28,200
I never wanted to work with this man anyway.

497
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:30,920
Report his condition to the chief.

498
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:31,599
Sir

499
00:30:31,599 --> 00:30:34,000
What about the anti-Japanese elements who escaped?

500
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:37,960
Do you know

501
00:30:38,359 --> 00:30:39,720
how many actually got away?

502
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,240
Judging from the scene,

503
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,799
it looks like about a squad.

504
00:30:48,119 --> 00:30:49,640
Only one escaped.

505
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:51,960
Report it to the chief.

506
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,960
This operation was a complete success.

507
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,119
Yes, sir.

508
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:08,920
Sorry.

509
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:11,000
Sorry for involving you all in last night's incident.

510
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,440
You can go back now.

511
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:18,759
It's fine.

512
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,359
Excuse me.

513
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:21,440
Don't worry.

514
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:22,480
I'm okay.

515
00:31:23,319 --> 00:31:25,160
Too much happened tonight.

516
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:27,160
I haven't even recovered myself.

517
00:31:27,839 --> 00:31:28,680
But, boss...

518
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,000
How could Zhao Di...

519
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:30,680
Shut up.

520
00:31:33,799 --> 00:31:34,720
They didn't give you a hard time, did they?

521
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,279
It was just a routine inquiry.

522
00:31:39,319 --> 00:31:41,039
Let's have a meeting at headquarters.

523
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,599
No matter what, about this matter—

524
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,680
We have to give the director an explanation.

525
00:31:55,359 --> 00:31:56,599
Let me borrow your car.

526
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:57,960
Why do you need the car?

527
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:58,960
Changle Alley.

528
00:31:59,599 --> 00:32:00,519
Why are you going there?

529
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,519
St. John's Lutheran Church.

530
00:32:02,759 --> 00:32:04,119
It's close to where Yuxin lives.

531
00:32:04,119 --> 00:32:05,359
You saw what happened just now.

532
00:32:05,359 --> 00:32:06,519
I'm really worried about her.

533
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,119
Don't worry.

534
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:10,319
She'll be fine.

535
00:32:10,519 --> 00:32:11,839
How can you be so sure?

536
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,440
Are you watching her?

537
00:32:18,759 --> 00:32:19,319
Let's go.

538
00:32:19,319 --> 00:32:20,279
I'll go with you to check on her.

539
00:32:32,119 --> 00:32:33,160
I understand.

540
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,079
The higher-ups require

541
00:32:35,079 --> 00:32:37,000
that on the basis of mutual cooperation

542
00:32:37,079 --> 00:32:38,079
we share intelligence.

543
00:32:38,319 --> 00:32:38,960
Director,

544
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,680
since this is an instruction from Nanjing

545
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,640
to the Central Executive Committee,

546
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,640
we must carry it out resolutely.

547
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:50,480
If Meihuating

548
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,400
has any new intelligence resources,

549
00:32:52,599 --> 00:32:55,079
we certainly have the right to request them.

550
00:32:55,319 --> 00:32:57,599
On the basis of equality and mutual benefit,

551
00:32:57,599 --> 00:32:58,599
we share together.

552
00:32:59,319 --> 00:33:00,000
That's right.

553
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,599
The top priority now is

554
00:33:02,599 --> 00:33:03,839
to figure out

555
00:33:03,839 --> 00:33:05,880
where Mizuno's intelligence is coming from.

556
00:33:07,079 --> 00:33:07,920
Understood.

557
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:09,599
Well then,

558
00:33:10,039 --> 00:33:11,039
wait for my news.

559
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,640
I heard it just happened.

560
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,759
Mizuno turned Wang Mutian.

561
00:33:22,039 --> 00:33:23,920
He took down the Military Command's Shanghai station in one move.

562
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:25,480
Yes.

563
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:26,920
I've already confirmed it.

564
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:30,440
The Japanese gendarmerie in Shanghai was also involved.

565
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,519
It happened in the old city.

566
00:33:32,519 --> 00:33:34,240
At the St. John's Church on Xiao Qiao Road.

567
00:33:36,359 --> 00:33:37,519
The Shanghai station.

568
00:33:37,799 --> 00:33:39,599
Has always been our arch-enemy.

569
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,079
For the past two years,

570
00:33:41,079 --> 00:33:42,640
they've been entangled with us again and again.

571
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:45,799
I never expected that overnight,

572
00:33:45,799 --> 00:33:47,400
Mizuno would destroy them.

573
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:48,960
Yes.

574
00:33:50,039 --> 00:33:51,079
I'm surprised too.

575
00:33:52,279 --> 00:33:53,799
When the news from Meihua Hall came out,

576
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,960
I double-checked it twice.

577
00:33:56,759 --> 00:33:57,799
It's definitely true.

578
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,279
Since the information is correct,

579
00:34:01,799 --> 00:34:03,720
then we must have missed something.

580
00:34:04,519 --> 00:34:06,519
Nanjing received reliable information.

581
00:34:06,519 --> 00:34:07,799
The reason Mizuno was able

582
00:34:07,799 --> 00:34:09,639
to act so swiftly and decisively

583
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:12,400
was all because of a special piece of intelligence.

584
00:34:15,079 --> 00:34:16,280
They might have

585
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,320
turned Wang Mutian a long time ago.

586
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:20,760
They just activated him at this moment.

587
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,519
That's all.

588
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,239
Now is not the time to be shocked.

589
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,320
The higher-ups instructed us

590
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,679
to do whatever it takes

591
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:32,400
to find out exactly what this intelligence is.

592
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,119
Director.

593
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,880
I'll send someone to Meihua Hall to investigate right away.

594
00:34:37,519 --> 00:34:38,880
With such a big secret,

595
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:41,039
what use are your spies?

596
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:42,400
Prepare the car.

597
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,320
I want to meet Mizuno in person.

598
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:45,320
Yes.

599
00:34:58,800 --> 00:34:59,800
There are no more pursuers.

600
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:02,800
If we get out from here

601
00:35:03,079 --> 00:35:04,000
we'll be safe.

602
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:05,920
Everyone, split up.

603
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:06,920
Retreat separately.

604
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:08,559
We've suffered losses.

605
00:35:08,559 --> 00:35:09,639
But our structure remains.

606
00:35:10,199 --> 00:35:11,679
Old Liu will contact everyone later.

607
00:35:11,719 --> 00:35:12,719
Will there even be a "later"?

608
00:35:14,119 --> 00:35:15,559
The entire Military Bureau in Shanghai

609
00:35:15,639 --> 00:35:17,079
is probably just you guys now.

610
00:35:17,639 --> 00:35:19,199
But I don't even know

611
00:35:19,199 --> 00:35:20,000
what really happened.

612
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,239
How much have you all been hiding from me?

613
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,440
Are you here to accuse us?

614
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,119
I just think this doesn't make sense.

615
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,320
This kind of arrangement—

616
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,599
When was Wang Mutian turned?

617
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,000
Was it a long time ago

618
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,559
that he was recruited by the Japanese?

619
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,119
Then why did he wait until now?

620
00:35:34,519 --> 00:35:35,960
If he had acted any earlier,

621
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:37,719
we would have been dead already.

622
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:39,559
I'm not so old that you get to question me.

623
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,840
It's a list.

624
00:35:44,039 --> 00:35:44,840
Old Seven,

625
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,079
It's come to this point.

626
00:35:47,079 --> 00:35:47,800
Even if we don't say it,

627
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,360
Wang Mutian will tell the Japanese anyway.

628
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,559
Is there any point in hiding it anymore?

629
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,280
What list?

630
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,079
Years ago, the Japanese

631
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,960
secretly compiled a list.

632
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,119
They infiltrated and turned

633
00:35:58,119 --> 00:35:59,639
some key officials in our government.

634
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:00,920
All these years,

635
00:36:01,079 --> 00:36:03,079
we've been investigating this matter.

636
00:36:03,239 --> 00:36:04,599
But we've never found any results.

637
00:36:05,239 --> 00:36:05,920
So,

638
00:36:06,159 --> 00:36:07,480
Wang Mutian was already

639
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,760
recruited by the Japanese a long time ago.

640
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,000
That's possible.

641
00:36:10,519 --> 00:36:11,559
It's been so many years.

642
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:13,119
They were playing the long game.

643
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,719
This is what's terrifying about Japanese intelligence agencies.

644
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,519
It's not terrifying.

645
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,400
It's shameless.

646
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,159
Wang Mutian

647
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,480
was probably targeted and recruited

648
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,480
by the Japanese during his early activities in Shanghai.

649
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,880
They waited so long before activating him.

650
00:36:32,599 --> 00:36:34,599
How did the Japanese manage that?

651
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:37,840
It's frightening.

652
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:39,599
This is only the beginning.

653
00:36:40,039 --> 00:36:41,639
We don't know how many

654
00:36:41,639 --> 00:36:44,679
important people on that list the Japanese still control.

655
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,599
No matter when,

656
00:36:51,679 --> 00:36:53,360
we must always remember this day.

657
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:55,079
This matter

658
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,760
won't end here.

659
00:36:58,199 --> 00:36:59,920
Everyone, return to your positions.

660
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,280
Wait for my orders.

661
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:02,320
Yes.

662
00:37:17,679 --> 00:37:18,519
Let her go.

663
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:20,800
Too many people died last night.

664
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
You shouldn't have mentioned the list.

665
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,239
Jiang Feiman knows about this.

666
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,159
It will definitely become a hidden danger.

667
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,719
If Black Fox really has returned,

668
00:37:33,519 --> 00:37:34,840
just relying on us,

669
00:37:35,239 --> 00:37:36,679
can we get the list?

670
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,079
Nian Ci,

671
00:38:07,639 --> 00:38:09,199
did something happen to you?

672
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:10,599
If

673
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,159
—I mean, if—

674
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,119
I want to join the Communist Party,

675
00:38:14,599 --> 00:38:16,679
is that still possible now?

676
00:38:18,119 --> 00:38:19,760
We welcome all the people.

677
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,519
And we unite everyone.

678
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,960
As long as you are willing to learn about the Party's program,

679
00:38:24,119 --> 00:38:25,199
truly believe in it,

680
00:38:25,199 --> 00:38:26,280
and accept the tests,

681
00:38:26,599 --> 00:38:28,159
the organization will certainly welcome you.

682
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,599
If you have this intention,

683
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,400
I will report it to the organization for you.

684
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:33,599
Okay.

685
00:38:36,719 --> 00:38:37,360
Nian Ci,

686
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:38,920
you don't have to feel troubled.

687
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,840
No matter what has happened,

688
00:38:41,159 --> 00:38:42,320
we don't want

689
00:38:42,559 --> 00:38:44,760
you to make this decision out of impulse.

690
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:46,400
I'm not troubled.

691
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,000
And I'm not acting on impulse.

692
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:49,639
I want to join the Communist Party.

693
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,239
I'm also willing to accept the tests.

694
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,239
But I know this takes time.

695
00:38:54,159 --> 00:38:55,679
I want to help you right now.

696
00:38:58,199 --> 00:38:59,639
You have already helped us.

697
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,440
Feiman,

698
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:03,559
Please come in.

699
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,199
I heard Director Li just came from a meeting.

700
00:40:09,719 --> 00:40:11,320
You really haven't stopped for a moment.

701
00:40:11,519 --> 00:40:12,039
Yes.

702
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:13,360
It's true, I've been very busy.

703
00:40:13,639 --> 00:40:16,360
But matters concerning Mr. Mizuno and Meihua Hall

704
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,199
to me

705
00:40:17,199 --> 00:40:18,320
are the most important.

706
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:19,800
Director Li,

707
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,599
you don't have any objections

708
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:22,800
to my proposals, do you?

709
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,199
Not at all.

710
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:27,039
I didn't participate in the operation this time.

711
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,639
It was entirely

712
00:40:28,679 --> 00:40:30,920
out of trust and respect for Mr. Mizuno.

713
00:40:31,519 --> 00:40:33,800
The Special Operations Headquarters does need to be reorganized.

714
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,639
And the Peace Conference is the perfect opportunity.

715
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:40,239
Mr. Mizuno helped me root out the cancer in headquarters.

716
00:40:40,239 --> 00:40:42,119
I'm extremely grateful for that.

717
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,920
Why would I have any objections?

718
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:47,840
So Director Li, you came here especially to thank me.

719
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:48,800
Of course.

720
00:40:49,159 --> 00:40:51,000
But besides being grateful,

721
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:53,719
I also want to ask Mr. Mizuno

722
00:40:53,719 --> 00:40:54,960
for a small favor.

723
00:40:57,519 --> 00:40:58,320
What kind of favor?

724
00:40:58,639 --> 00:41:01,400
I heard that the undercover agent who was shot

725
00:41:03,039 --> 00:41:05,480
I'll have my men send the body and

726
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,559
the investigation results over.

727
00:41:09,199 --> 00:41:11,679
If it was just for the investigation results,

728
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:14,239
why would I come here in person?

729
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,840
Mr. Mizuno capturing the undercover agent

730
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,280
was just a lucky accident.

731
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,079
Compared to

732
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:22,760
the operation to take down the entire Military Command Shanghai Station,

733
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:23,719
this

734
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,119
is nothing in comparison.

735
00:41:28,119 --> 00:41:28,880
Director Li,

736
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,960
your information is quite up-to-date.

737
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:32,519
So,

738
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,760
what interests me most is

739
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:38,800
how Mr. Mizuno managed to accomplish all this.
