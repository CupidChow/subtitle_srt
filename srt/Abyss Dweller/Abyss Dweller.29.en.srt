1
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,840
Senior Asai,

2
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:49,640
do you trust me, Mizuno?

3
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:53,280
Trust

4
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:54,719
for an agent

5
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:56,159
is a luxury.

6
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,680
Mizuno,

7
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:00,439
you should understand this better than I do, right?

8
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:01,840
Senior Asai,

9
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,280
the list must not fall into anyone else's hands.

10
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,319
Only if we work together

11
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:08,719
can you achieve your grand vision.

12
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:10,639
It's time for you to make a choice.

13
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,639
Understood.

14
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:17,800
Then, I won't disturb you any further.

15
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,319
Mr. Mizuno,

16
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:21,960
please wait.

17
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:27,360
Of all the places I've been over the years,

18
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:29,280
this is the harshest.

19
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,680
It's colder and more piercing than a southern winter.

20
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:34,919
Mizuno,

21
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,960
if possible,

22
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:41,919
may I have another set of winter pajamas?

23
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,240
Senior Asai,

24
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:50,639
I may have to disappoint you.

25
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:51,919
I'm very sorry.

26
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,319
Just going out on a field assignment

27
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,759
can cause so much trouble.

28
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:05,560
If you ask me,

29
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,000
we really should have your sister-in-law

30
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,680
go to the Chenghuang Temple

31
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,960
and pray for your safety.

32
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,439
If you’re not trusted,

33
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:12,680
burning incense won’t help.

34
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,560
I think you’d better pay your respects to the director instead.

35
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,159
In extraordinary times,

36
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:19,240
it doesn’t hurt to be a bit more cautious.

37
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:20,599
Besides, after this incident,

38
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:22,520
what else could he possibly worry about you?

39
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,800
Song Qian is his man.

40
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:24,840
If he really cared,

41
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,159
he would have held you accountable long ago.

42
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:27,520
Alright.

43
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,599
You’ve worked hard for several days.

44
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:29,639
Go back and get some rest.

45
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,520
Spend some time with your family.

46
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,919
Keep a close eye on him for me.

47
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:37,400
Don’t let the military find him.

48
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,400
But we can’t go on like this forever.

49
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,639
I’m just worried General Toihara will ask about him.

50
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,520
Remember this:

51
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,240
the most important thing for us is the list.

52
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:45,960
If anything happens,

53
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,919
it has nothing to do with us.

54
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,360
Understood.

55
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:05,759
Senior Asai was right.

56
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,319
Such a great achievement

57
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:10,000
can’t just be handed over to someone else.

58
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:29,680
Sister Man,

59
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,199
will everything be alright?

60
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:38,560
This path we're on

61
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,720
will come to an end someday, won't it?

62
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:44,439
I was really naive before.

63
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,279
I

64
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:48,040
actually thought

65
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:49,399
even though

66
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,519
we're in

67
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:52,439
such a dangerous situation right now,

68
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:53,959
that one day

69
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,800
we would definitely get out of this.

70
00:04:56,199 --> 00:04:57,800
I even wanted to convince Lao Xie.

71
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:01,079
Maybe I was just too scared myself.

72
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,439
Because there are so many things I want to do

73
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:05,040
but haven't done yet.

74
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,079
I want to go back to my hometown

75
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,439
to pay respects to my late parents,

76
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,879
and take you with me.

77
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,839
There are so many things

78
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:19,759
I want to do with you

79
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,519
but haven't done.

80
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:23,639
It's because I think about all this

81
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,000
that I get scared.

82
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,480
I'm afraid that one day, all of a sudden,

83
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,439
we'll end up like Sister Man,

84
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,560
and never have another chance.

85
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:41,199
Let's go.

86
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,040
Let's not have any regrets.

87
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,360
Let's take a photo together.

88
00:05:57,519 --> 00:05:58,439
Sure.

89
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:02,839
You two, get a little closer.

90
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:11,279
Okay, a bit closer.

91
00:06:17,959 --> 00:06:19,199
That's it.

92
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,959
Alright, get ready.

93
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:24,639
One, two, three.

94
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,279
What's wrong?

95
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,279
It's nothing.

96
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:48,879
I just feel

97
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,680
it's so beautiful.

98
00:06:56,199 --> 00:06:56,839
Yes.

99
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,480
If there were no war,

100
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,040
the night view of this city

101
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,720
would always be this beautiful.

102
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,639
That day will come.

103
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,160
Liang Shuo,

104
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,120
I'm really grateful you appeared in my life.

105
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:24,079
Thank you so much.

106
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:28,240
Me too.

107
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,159
Lu Xijian, what are you trying to do?

108
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,200
Where are you going?

109
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,159
Where I go has nothing to do with you.

110
00:08:55,639 --> 00:08:57,720
You're not going to meet the Communists, are you?

111
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,639
If you have doubts,

112
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:00,879
you can go and verify it yourself.

113
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:01,600
I really don't like

114
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,000
playing house with you here.

115
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:05,200
I'd like to hear your explanation.

116
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:06,799
Train malfunction.

117
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:07,840
Temporary transfer.

118
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,840
Lost contact midway.

119
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,039
During the escort.

120
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:12,200
Every possible accident happened.

121
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:14,279
You've already read the report.

122
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:16,200
If I had really saved Jiang Feiman,

123
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,679
I wouldn't be standing here now

124
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:18,799
talking to you.

125
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:21,279
Don't think I don't know what you're up to.

126
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:22,840
You may not have saved her,

127
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,039
but that doesn't mean you didn't want to.

128
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,039
As an agent,

129
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:30,919
you shouldn't rely on your instincts to survive.

130
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,159
My brother gave his life for you.

131
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,200
I won't allow you to make any mistakes.

132
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:39,639
That could affect our grand plan.

133
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:41,080
Enough talking.

134
00:09:41,559 --> 00:09:43,320
I don't want to waste time with you here.

135
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,799
Liang Shuo.

136
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:49,440
Don't let me catch you slipping up.

137
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,120
Otherwise, I'll make sure you sacrifice yourself for the Party and the nation.

138
00:09:54,519 --> 00:09:55,360
Lu Xijian.

139
00:09:55,919 --> 00:09:57,360
If, even at this point,

140
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:59,960
you're still only thinking about eliminating dissent,

141
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,679
then there's truly only one way left—death.

142
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,559
Have you thought it through?

143
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:12,919
Your hatred toward me

144
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,960
is it really because you don't trust me,

145
00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:17,919
or is it because you feel guilty about your brother?

146
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:20,720
His name was Xiao Si, right?

147
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,759
Your brother died because of you,

148
00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:23,720
not because of me.

149
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,799
No matter how many reasons you have,

150
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:31,600
even if it's for the Party or the country,

151
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:35,240
it's still no excuse to drag your brother down with you.

152
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,120
You're late.

153
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,159
It's safer to meet here.

154
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:15,559
We've been under close surveillance lately.

155
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:29,919
About Feiman's situation,

156
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,440
I know.

157
00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:33,200
You've already done your best.

158
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,919
There's no need to blame yourself.

159
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,120
I've already reported it to the organization.

160
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:38,759
They're trying to find a solution.

161
00:11:38,759 --> 00:11:40,159
They plan to launch a rescue operation in Nanjing.

162
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:41,960
It will be very difficult.

163
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:43,120
But

164
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:45,080
there's still some hope.

165
00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:46,679
At the moment,

166
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,600
with a severe shortage of manpower and weapons,

167
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:51,320
all we can do

168
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,360
is wait and see.

169
00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:56,320
What's the situation with Scorpio?

170
00:11:57,159 --> 00:11:59,519
He already knew that Nakayama Kazuo isn't Asai Hisashi.

171
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:01,960
He deliberately fed us false information.

172
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,600
I didn't expect

173
00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:07,000
that even with a major enemy at hand,

174
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,240
he's still thinking about wearing each other down.

175
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,840
He suspects Mizuno Shingen

176
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,960
of hiding Asai Hisashi and the list.

177
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,879
But he can't fully control the situation yet.

178
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,519
He wants me to start with Mizuno Shingen.

179
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:21,519
On this point,

180
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,879
our thinking

181
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,399
actually aligns.

182
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,600
This is what we

183
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,879
captured on Feiji Si Road

184
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:34,279
between No. 143

185
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:36,600
and No. 156

186
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,480
We've been watching this place

187
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,840
for a long time

188
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:42,120
The people inside

189
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,399
have never shown themselves

190
00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:44,639
But

191
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,120
Mizuno Shingen's adjutant

192
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,440
has been coming and going frequently lately

193
00:12:48,679 --> 00:12:49,600
Surprisingly

194
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:50,879
look

195
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,919
Mizuno Shingen also went there

196
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:56,519
This place is not simple

197
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,639
If it's heavily guarded

198
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,320
it's hard to get close

199
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:03,960
Can I share these photos

200
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,440
with Li Hanzhi

201
00:13:06,039 --> 00:13:07,360
and have him help us confirm

202
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,679
At this critical moment

203
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:16,279
we need to buy some time

204
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:17,960
Yes

205
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,200
I'll do it as soon as possible

206
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,639
There's one more thing

207
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:26,720
Cui Mo once caught

208
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,399
the leader of Da Feng Hall who tried to assassinate me

209
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:29,639
His name is Gu Zhentian

210
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,200
He once received Uncle Yan's favor

211
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,200
He's a real man

212
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:33,360
I've looked into him

213
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:35,159
He has helped many refugees

214
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,240
So

215
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,480
I managed to have him transferred to the police department

216
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,120
Newspapers for sale, newspapers for sale

217
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:40,759
Kid

218
00:13:40,759 --> 00:13:41,759
Anyone want to buy a newspaper?

219
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:42,639
Give me a newspaper

220
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:50,840
Gu Zhentian

221
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:52,440
Someone has paid your bail.

222
00:13:52,679 --> 00:13:53,519
You can leave now.

223
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,720
I heard from Comrade Maple Leaf

224
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,799
that he mentioned this person.

225
00:13:58,039 --> 00:13:58,960
He said

226
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,240
he is a passionate person.

227
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,200
I want to release him.

228
00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:04,360
After all,

229
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:06,480
the organization requires us

230
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,240
to unite all the people we can.

231
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:10,120
He has quite a few followers.

232
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,679
Some of them are patriots.

233
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:12,720
They are also quite skilled.

234
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,519
If, after assessment,

235
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,360
they can join our ranks,

236
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,279
Sir,

237
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,399
a gentleman bought a newspaper for you.

238
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:26,360
Newspapers for sale! Newspapers!

239
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:32,360
Newspapers for sale!

240
00:14:34,279 --> 00:14:35,600
Extra! Extra! Newspapers for sale!

241
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,519
Anyone want to buy a newspaper?

242
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,720
Boss, do you need a ride?

243
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:43,879
Come with me, don't look back.

244
00:14:43,879 --> 00:14:45,080
Get in the car, quickly!

245
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:48,000
Boss, hold on tight.

246
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,360
Let's go!

247
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,879
If we can

248
00:14:54,879 --> 00:14:56,360
unite them,

249
00:14:56,519 --> 00:14:57,320
it would indeed

250
00:14:57,559 --> 00:14:59,279
be a force to be reckoned with.

251
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:00,440
That's what I think.

252
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,080
So I want to find a reason

253
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,120
to let him go.

254
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:05,559
But I still need to have Number 76 watch him.

255
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:08,120
Otherwise, it might arouse suspicion from Cui Mo's side.

256
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,639
I understand.

257
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,320
You want

258
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,639
me to send someone to help him.

259
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:13,559
Yes.

260
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:14,679
Alright.

261
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:16,440
Leave this matter to me.

262
00:15:27,639 --> 00:15:28,559
Over there! After them!

263
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,639
What's going on?

264
00:15:34,919 --> 00:15:36,440
Number 76 isn't really letting him go.

265
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:37,759
They're trying to catch everyone at once.

266
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,399
Someone sent me to rescue you.

267
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,159
Sir, I owe you my life.

268
00:15:41,559 --> 00:15:42,639
I, Gu, have no way to repay you.

269
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:43,879
The person who wants to save you

270
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:44,960
isn't me.

271
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,240
Then who is it?

272
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,639
The Trinity list is in Shanghai.

273
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,039
It's in the hands of Mizuno Shingen.

274
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,480
Why are you so sure?

275
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:01,360
Intuition.

276
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,000
Intuition.

277
00:16:10,519 --> 00:16:12,000
Kazuo Nakayama came to Shanghai

278
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:14,559
That was information released by Meihua Hall

279
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:17,440
which made us mistakenly believe this person was Hisashi Asai

280
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:18,879
Because of that

281
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:20,679
we set up a plan to capture the underground party

282
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,240
But is it possible

283
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:25,840
that this subconscious action

284
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,320
actually indicates

285
00:16:27,559 --> 00:16:28,960
that the real Hisashi Asai

286
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,240
has also secretly entered Shanghai

287
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,000
Go on

288
00:16:37,559 --> 00:16:38,720
And at the same time

289
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,879
Mizuno Shingen's adjutant has been secretly active several times

290
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,240
And Mizuno Shingen

291
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,000
also appeared at just the right moment

292
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,360
Ever since the Shanghai station was cracked

293
00:16:56,519 --> 00:16:57,600
Chief Mizuno

294
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,759
in the intelligence struggle in Shanghai

295
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,240
has always had the upper hand

296
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:03,200
Since we've already determined

297
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,359
that the 3-1 list is playing a role

298
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,599
then why don't we

299
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,440
go further

300
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,599
and make an even bolder assumption?

301
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,319
Your analysis makes a lot of sense

302
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:17,640
At the very least

303
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,160
we should at least test it out

304
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,519
If Hisashi Asai

305
00:17:20,519 --> 00:17:22,160
has really arrived in Shanghai

306
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,160
then maybe

307
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,640
he's right there

308
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:27,880
Someone come

309
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:36,720
Director

310
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:37,680
Go

311
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,119
Call Cui Mo here

312
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:39,599
Yes

313
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:46,839
Chief, this is...

314
00:17:46,839 --> 00:17:48,279
We're about to take action.

315
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:51,240
This is...

316
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,319
What place is this?

317
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,319
It used to be a seamen's club in Hongkou.

318
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,200
Now it belongs to the Meihua Hall.

319
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,839
Nearby here,

320
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:02,799
there's a pretty good restaurant.

321
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:04,920
If you want to treat someone,

322
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,960
Shingen Mizuno definitely won't refuse.

323
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:08,160
It's just that...

324
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,759
what excuse should we use?

325
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:14,400
Eliminating the Shanghai station of the Military Statistics Bureau

326
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:16,680
isn't that worth celebrating?

327
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:17,759
Of course.

328
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,799
I'll have Director Cui

329
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,400
monitor the seamen's club.

330
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,440
keep it under surveillance.

331
00:18:22,759 --> 00:18:23,559
As for me,

332
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:26,359
I'll personally go test Mizuno's reaction.

333
00:18:27,079 --> 00:18:29,400
If this matter is really confirmed,

334
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:30,680
then we

335
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,599
will inevitably have to

336
00:18:32,599 --> 00:18:33,720
fall out with Mizuno.

337
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:35,799
Director Liang,

338
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,400
you've handled this matter

339
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,440
very well.

340
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,440
If we really capture Asai Shou,

341
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:46,799
I'll definitely return to Nanjing and recommend you for a commendation.

342
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:48,480
Thank you, Chief.

343
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,279
With such a big operation,

344
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,759
do you think Shingen Mizuno

345
00:19:14,759 --> 00:19:15,960
will get suspicious?

346
00:19:16,759 --> 00:19:18,359
It doesn't matter if he does or not.

347
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,680
We're playing our cards openly this time.

348
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:22,960
Look over there.

349
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,559
This place has been deserted for so long.

350
00:19:30,759 --> 00:19:31,480
And yet there are still people here.

351
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:33,680
There must be something wrong.

352
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,880
It's already been forty minutes.

353
00:19:36,359 --> 00:19:38,039
The person guarding the door hasn't moved at all.

354
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,519
This doesn't look like a VIP.

355
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,039
It looks more like a prisoner.

356
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,279
Who knows.

357
00:19:47,079 --> 00:19:48,400
What are you planning to do next?

358
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,880
Stir up some trouble.

359
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,400
Let's see how Mizuno Shingen reacts.

360
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,319
The storage room behind the hotel kitchen.

361
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,400
It's very close to the club.

362
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,799
The kitchen is a restricted area.

363
00:20:00,319 --> 00:20:02,079
If a fire accidentally breaks out or something,

364
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:03,640
it wouldn't be surprising at all.

365
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,319
You really have a lot of tricks up your sleeve.

366
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,680
Time to get to work.

367
00:20:33,759 --> 00:20:36,039
Today we're honored to have Director Mizuno with us.

368
00:20:36,039 --> 00:20:37,920
It's truly my honor.

369
00:20:38,359 --> 00:20:39,519
Director Li is hosting.

370
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:40,960
How could I not come?

371
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,359
A few days ago,

372
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,079
I'm afraid there was

373
00:20:45,079 --> 00:20:46,119
some misunderstanding between us.

374
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:49,359
Today's gathering is a long-overdue drink.

375
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:52,880
Director Mizuno's victory stabilized the situation in Shanghai.

376
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,200
It's truly a historic achievement.

377
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,279
Unfortunately, I

378
00:20:56,279 --> 00:20:58,680
have been too busy at headquarters to get away.

379
00:20:59,079 --> 00:21:00,960
That's why it was delayed until today.

380
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,319
Let me offer a toast as an apology.

381
00:21:04,039 --> 00:21:05,880
Shanghai's current stability

382
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,000
is inseparable from your efforts.

383
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,960
Director.

384
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:11,920
You're too kind.

385
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:12,640
Well then,

386
00:21:12,839 --> 00:21:13,559
please.

387
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:14,759
Please.

388
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:18,359
Close the door.

389
00:21:53,839 --> 00:21:55,359
Hurry up and take those dishes to the kitchen.

390
00:21:55,359 --> 00:21:56,039
Quickly.

391
00:22:15,079 --> 00:22:15,920
Chief Mizuno.

392
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:23,119
The setup looks pretty good.

393
00:22:24,079 --> 00:22:25,319
I've been in Hongkou for so long,

394
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,319
but I've never been to a place like this.

395
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,519
Chief Mizuno is always busy with so many affairs.

396
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,960
Unlike people like me with nothing to do.

397
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Naturally, you don't have the time

398
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,759
to bother with eating and drinking here.

399
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:36,319
Director.

400
00:22:36,319 --> 00:22:38,079
You have to suppress the anti-Japanese elements,

401
00:22:38,079 --> 00:22:41,519
and also exhaust yourself preparing for the Peace Conference.

402
00:22:41,599 --> 00:22:42,519
I'm afraid

403
00:22:42,519 --> 00:22:43,839
you're working too hard.

404
00:22:44,119 --> 00:22:46,359
You should also delegate some authority appropriately.

405
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,039
Let people like us

406
00:22:48,039 --> 00:22:49,920
share some of your burdens.

407
00:22:55,119 --> 00:22:56,000
Director Li.

408
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,440
Today's meal

409
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,319
isn't really about the food or drink, is it?

410
00:22:59,319 --> 00:23:00,359
Not at all.

411
00:23:00,359 --> 00:23:01,480
You're exaggerating.

412
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:04,079
I'm not worthy of such words.

413
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:04,799
Come.

414
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:05,319
Have a seat.

415
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,720
I thought Director Li invited me to dinner

416
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,839
because of our personal relationship.

417
00:23:31,079 --> 00:23:33,000
Turns out I was overthinking it.

418
00:23:33,359 --> 00:23:34,319
Chief Mizuno,

419
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:36,519
when the new government was first established,

420
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:38,200
it was us officials

421
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:40,559
who worked tirelessly day and night,

422
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,920
so that we could have

423
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,799
such a prosperous era.

424
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:46,279
But some things shouldn't cross the line.

425
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,160
What do you mean?

426
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:53,759
There's a fire!

427
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,680
Hurry!

428
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,319
Put out the fire, quickly!

429
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,480
Put out the fire, quickly!

430
00:24:01,759 --> 00:24:03,000
Put out the fire, quickly!

431
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:10,880
Director

432
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:12,640
What are you doing?

433
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,799
Don’t you know I’m talking to Director Li?

434
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,599
There was a fire at that place.

435
00:24:16,599 --> 00:24:17,200
That gentleman—

436
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,000
Enough.

437
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,279
Be quiet.

438
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,440
Cui Mo.

439
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,480
Director.

440
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,079
What happened?

441
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:28,359
It was probably due to improper operation in the hotel kitchen.

442
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,440
That caused the fire.

443
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,759
I’ve already had someone check it.

444
00:24:30,759 --> 00:24:31,720
It’s nothing serious.

445
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:34,119
What an unfortunate coincidence.

446
00:24:34,839 --> 00:24:36,160
Will it affect our meal?

447
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:37,799
Just in case,

448
00:24:37,799 --> 00:24:40,160
I’d like to ask Director and Mr. Mizuno to move elsewhere.

449
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:43,880
Mr. Mizuno.

450
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,680
How about we—

451
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,440
change to another place and continue our discussion?

452
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,359
It seems today isn’t the day for a gathering.

453
00:24:50,839 --> 00:24:51,960
I’ll host another day.

454
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,279
Please come to Meihua Hall.

455
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:54,960
Mr. Mizuno.

456
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,440
You’re too kind.

457
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:58,279
Sorry to have disturbed your pleasant time.

458
00:24:58,759 --> 00:25:00,279
Alright, let’s do it another day.

459
00:25:00,279 --> 00:25:01,440
I’ll still be the host.

460
00:25:02,079 --> 00:25:04,720
I’ll apologize and toast you in person next time.

461
00:25:05,599 --> 00:25:07,400
I understand your concerns about the new government.

462
00:25:07,599 --> 00:25:08,799
But some matters

463
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:10,319
still require careful consideration.

464
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:14,400
Since Mr. Mizuno is willing to be open and honest,

465
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,559
that’s wonderful.

466
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:17,519
When the time comes,

467
00:25:18,039 --> 00:25:19,160
I, Li,

468
00:25:19,799 --> 00:25:21,160
will trouble you then.

469
00:25:31,759 --> 00:25:32,400
It's on fire!

470
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:33,359
Hurry, put out the fire!

471
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:34,359
Put out the fire!

472
00:25:34,359 --> 00:25:34,920
Hurry up!

473
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:35,720
It's on fire!

474
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:36,960
Quick!

475
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,640
Hurry up and put out the fire!

476
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,359
Hello

477
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:40,440
It's me

478
00:26:41,119 --> 00:26:42,319
Why are you calling back?

479
00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:43,599
Haven't you finished work yet?

480
00:26:43,599 --> 00:26:45,319
I'm on an assignment from headquarters

481
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,400
It's a bit tricky

482
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,039
I want to ask you for a favor

483
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,000
Go ahead

484
00:26:49,319 --> 00:26:51,240
My chronic headache is acting up again

485
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,920
I'd like you to go to the pharmacy for me

486
00:26:53,119 --> 00:26:55,240
Ask the doctor to use the same prescription as last time

487
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:56,319
Prepare and decoct the medicine

488
00:26:56,319 --> 00:26:57,200
Have an assistant

489
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,519
deliver it to 217 Mactol Road

490
00:27:00,079 --> 00:27:00,880
Understood

491
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:11,720
Mr. Asai

492
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,200
Hello.

493
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:15,880
Outside,

494
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,720
did something just happen?

495
00:27:19,079 --> 00:27:20,359
It was just something in the kitchen of the restaurant next door.

496
00:27:20,359 --> 00:27:22,240
Just a small mishap.

497
00:27:22,359 --> 00:27:23,680
A small mishap?

498
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:25,960
I'm afraid that here,

499
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,799
it's no longer safe.

500
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
You don't need to be so nervous.

501
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,960
The whole street is filled with our people.

502
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:38,200
The entire street is under our control.

503
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,720
First of all,

504
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:42,240
I don't believe anything is just an accident.

505
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:43,359
Mr. Takagi,

506
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:44,920
for an agent,

507
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:47,319
do you know the phrase "testing the waters"?

508
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,319
Now,

509
00:27:48,319 --> 00:27:52,440
the whole street knows that the Seamen's Club

510
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,400
is heavily guarded.

511
00:27:57,079 --> 00:27:58,400
All for me,

512
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:01,640
so I won't be captured by anti-Japanese elements.

513
00:28:01,799 --> 00:28:04,039
Go quickly and get Mizuno.

514
00:28:04,039 --> 00:28:06,839
Have him transfer me somewhere else as soon as possible.

515
00:28:10,759 --> 00:28:12,039
Mr. Asai,

516
00:28:12,759 --> 00:28:15,759
this is not a place for you to give orders.

517
00:28:16,359 --> 00:28:17,559
All of this

518
00:28:17,559 --> 00:28:18,839
was promised by your chief

519
00:28:18,839 --> 00:28:21,880
in our agreement.

520
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,240
So,

521
00:28:25,799 --> 00:28:28,400
you should also keep your end of the bargain.

522
00:28:29,799 --> 00:28:31,720
Just relax.

523
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:38,440
Increase the security.

524
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,079
Yes, sir.

525
00:28:48,319 --> 00:28:50,319
Mizuno had Takagi Yuyi take people there immediately.

526
00:28:50,319 --> 00:28:51,960
They went to the nearby seamen's club.

527
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,480
Looks like we weren't wrong.

528
00:28:55,799 --> 00:28:57,759
There's definitely something suspicious about this place.

529
00:28:58,759 --> 00:28:59,480
Cui Mo.

530
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:00,960
What do you think?

531
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,319
Director, don't worry.

532
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,920
I'll have the guys keep an eye on it for now.

533
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:04,839
As soon as there's a chance,

534
00:29:04,839 --> 00:29:06,599
we'll find out what's going on inside.

535
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,440
Director.

536
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,359
After today's unexpected incident,

537
00:29:10,519 --> 00:29:12,279
they'll probably be more alert.

538
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,039
What about Liang Shuo?

539
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:18,799
Director Liang is monitoring nearby.

540
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,440
Let's return to headquarters first.

541
00:29:23,839 --> 00:29:24,839
We'll make a long-term plan.

542
00:29:50,279 --> 00:29:51,079
Old Tan.

543
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,279
It's me.

544
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:02,160
Why did you come here?

545
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:02,920
There's a situation.

546
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:04,480
Come.

547
00:30:09,319 --> 00:30:10,920
Qingshuang sent back some news.

548
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,839
They said at the seamen's club on Maiketuo Road

549
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:13,839
something's going on.

550
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,200
I need to report this information

551
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,920
to the organization immediately.

552
00:30:21,839 --> 00:30:23,240
Should I take people to monitor the place?

553
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:25,599
Right now,

554
00:30:25,759 --> 00:30:28,480
No. 76 is already watching that place.

555
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,440
It's too dangerous to send a fixed post.

556
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:31,839
How about this:

557
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,480
Send a few mobile scouts.

558
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,000
We absolutely can't act rashly.

559
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:36,160
I understand.

560
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:51,880
Is there anything else to report?

561
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,680
If not,

562
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:57,039
then keep a close watch on the Seamen's Club.

563
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,480
Director Lu.

564
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,039
Thank you for your hard work.

565
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,559
The top priority now

566
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:05,160
is to figure out what's going on inside.

567
00:31:07,119 --> 00:31:09,720
This matter needs to be handled secretly.

568
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:13,039
Don't let the Japanese notice anything for now.

569
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:14,319
Yes.

570
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:30,960
Director Lu.

571
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,160
Director Lu.

572
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:17,240
Judging by the current situation,

573
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,519
this Seamen's Club

574
00:33:20,319 --> 00:33:22,079
is definitely not simple.

575
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:28,119
Any news from Liang Shuo's side?

576
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,400
They're still under surveillance.

577
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,880
I've already sent people to investigate.

578
00:33:31,119 --> 00:33:32,400
Today's big fire

579
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:33,960
didn't alarm them at all.

580
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,160
Everything is normal for now.

581
00:33:35,759 --> 00:33:37,599
We don't have much time left.

582
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:41,640
The list is a political bargaining chip in the hands of the Japanese.

583
00:33:42,079 --> 00:33:43,119
And Chairman Wang

584
00:33:43,119 --> 00:33:45,480
wants to gain more political benefits.

585
00:33:45,599 --> 00:33:46,960
That means we need to

586
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:50,000
take action before the peace conference convenes.

587
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,720
do something.

588
00:33:52,279 --> 00:33:53,880
Should we contact Director Zhou?

589
00:33:54,119 --> 00:33:55,440
In the name of Nanjing,

590
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:57,240
put pressure on the Japanese Foreign Ministry.

591
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:02,559
Isn't Mizuno still planning to invite me to dinner?

592
00:34:03,559 --> 00:34:05,759
Let's not push him too hard.

593
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:07,799
Set up surveillance around the area.

594
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:09,639
I must find out

595
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,719
what exactly is going on

596
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,639
inside this Seamen's Club.

597
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:17,000
Come in.

598
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:22,400
Director Li.

599
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,840
News just came from Liang's side.

600
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,639
Inside this Seamen's Club,

601
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,719
someone is indeed being secretly detained.

602
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:37,159
Moreover,

603
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:39,199
there are guards on duty,

604
00:34:39,559 --> 00:34:40,719
and the security is very tight.

605
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:50,559
You clap once, I clap once

606
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:53,760
One child rides an airplane

607
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,679
You clap twice, I clap twice

608
00:34:56,679 --> 00:34:59,480
Two children drop a handkerchief

609
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,480
You clap three times, I clap three times

610
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,519
Three children come to move bricks

611
00:35:07,159 --> 00:35:08,920
Selling tea leaves

612
00:35:10,039 --> 00:35:11,719
Fresh tea leaves

613
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:15,920
Tea leaves

614
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,199
Selling tea leaves

615
00:35:24,559 --> 00:35:25,519
One newspaper, please

616
00:35:25,519 --> 00:35:26,199
Okay

617
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:32,400
Thank you

618
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,199
Boss

619
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,280
One steamed bun, please

620
00:36:00,039 --> 00:36:00,519
Mom

621
00:36:00,519 --> 00:36:01,639
Walk a little slower

622
00:36:01,639 --> 00:36:03,000
My foot hurts

623
00:36:03,239 --> 00:36:04,639
Okay, we're almost home

624
00:36:04,639 --> 00:36:05,320
Mom

625
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,679
Walk a little slower

626
00:36:06,679 --> 00:36:07,760
My foot hurts

627
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:09,519
How about this

628
00:36:09,519 --> 00:36:11,159
Shall we go over there and rest for a bit?

629
00:36:11,159 --> 00:36:11,639
Okay

630
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:12,400
Come on

631
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,760
Nuonuo, your little foot hurts

632
00:36:18,239 --> 00:36:19,440
Let me take a look

633
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,280
Does it still hurt?

634
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:25,920
It doesn't hurt anymore

635
00:36:26,199 --> 00:36:27,519
Shall we go home then?

636
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:28,159
Okay

637
00:36:37,199 --> 00:36:38,000
Lao Wu

638
00:36:38,599 --> 00:36:39,800
In this seamen's club

639
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,280
this person is

640
00:36:42,639 --> 00:36:44,920
the real controller of the 31 List

641
00:36:46,039 --> 00:36:47,039
Asai Hisashi

642
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:49,840
How do you know?

643
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,119
He is under strict guard and protection

644
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,400
but not kept in the Plum Blossom Hall

645
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,199
Don't you think that's contradictory?

646
00:36:59,039 --> 00:36:59,840
That's true.

647
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:01,599
In Hongkou,

648
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,199
where else

649
00:37:03,239 --> 00:37:05,199
could be safer than the Mei Agency?

650
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,400
There's only one reason.

651
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,599
Mizuno Shingen

652
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:11,599
doesn't want their cooperation

653
00:37:11,639 --> 00:37:12,719
to be known.

654
00:37:13,199 --> 00:37:14,320
In that case,

655
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,480
this could be an opportunity for us.

656
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,320
The security is so tight,

657
00:37:18,599 --> 00:37:20,639
I think we shouldn't rush things.

658
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,400
We can't wait any longer.

659
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:24,480
We need to act now.

660
00:37:24,519 --> 00:37:25,320
Take action?

661
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,280
How do we act?

662
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,000
Be ready to risk everything.

663
00:37:28,199 --> 00:37:29,360
Risk everything?

664
00:37:29,719 --> 00:37:32,119
Fifth, don't act on impulse.

665
00:37:32,119 --> 00:37:33,760
Besides, how do you know

666
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,760
this isn't a trap set by the Japanese?

667
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,480
Everyone else can wait,

668
00:37:37,519 --> 00:37:39,119
but we can't afford to.

669
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,159
We need to use unconventional tactics.

670
00:37:41,679 --> 00:37:42,840
Only by catching them off guard

671
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,159
can we win in one strike.

672
00:37:45,199 --> 00:37:46,079
So that's it.

673
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:47,760
Those trainees from Qingpu

674
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:48,960
have they all been gathered?

675
00:37:50,039 --> 00:37:50,840
Fifth,

676
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,920
these are the only chips we have left.

677
00:37:54,159 --> 00:37:55,199
What I mean is,

678
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,280
since No. 76 is paying so much attention,

679
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,239
why don't we wait for the right moment to act?

680
00:37:59,239 --> 00:38:01,159
That's just waiting for death.

681
00:38:09,679 --> 00:38:11,920
The Shanghai station of the Military Bureau is a cautionary example.

682
00:38:12,599 --> 00:38:14,519
I'm worried that the longer we wait, the more likely something will go wrong.

683
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,159
Delays bring unexpected changes.

684
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,519
But have you considered this?

685
00:38:17,519 --> 00:38:18,920
What if the operation fails?

686
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,400
Neither of us can bear that responsibility.

687
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,639
I was appointed to lead the Shanghai station.

688
00:38:23,159 --> 00:38:24,039
All the consequences

689
00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:26,079
will be borne by me alone.

690
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,719
The decisions I make

691
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,960
no one can stop.

692
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:33,400
You—

693
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:35,239
You're being stubborn.

694
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,840
You want to save your older brother.

695
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:03,079
I have my own reasons too.

696
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,320
We can work together.

697
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,599
But—

698
00:39:08,599 --> 00:39:11,920
You must agree to one small condition.

699
00:39:15,719 --> 00:39:16,519
Who?

700
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,239
Everyone,

701
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,360
you are all in the prime of your youth,

702
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,360
full of passion

703
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,360
and ready to charge forward with enthusiasm.

704
00:40:00,039 --> 00:40:02,400
Your willingness to answer my call

705
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:03,760
shows that

706
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,719
you are all ambitious and outstanding young people.

707
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,519
You bear the nation's gratitude

708
00:40:08,559 --> 00:40:09,800
and are willing to face the country's hardships.

709
00:40:10,039 --> 00:40:11,800
All you lack is an opportunity.

710
00:40:12,239 --> 00:40:13,039
Now,

711
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,960
there is such a remarkable opportunity before you.

712
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,719
An opportunity that allows you

713
00:40:17,719 --> 00:40:19,920
to fulfill your lifelong aspirations.

714
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,880
An opportunity to make your names go down in history,

715
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:24,880
to be remembered for generations.

716
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:26,760
Tell me,

717
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:29,880
are you willing to seize this opportunity?

718
00:40:30,159 --> 00:40:31,039
We are!

719
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,079
Good.

720
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:36,480
You are exactly the young people our nation needs.

721
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:37,719
Now

722
00:40:38,239 --> 00:40:39,360
is the time when we need you

723
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:41,000
to show your courage.

724
00:40:41,239 --> 00:40:42,679
A moment of glory,

725
00:40:43,039 --> 00:40:43,800
a moment for us

726
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:46,159
to achieve honor and our ideals.

727
00:40:47,079 --> 00:40:47,920
Take up your arms,

728
00:40:48,239 --> 00:40:49,760
write history with your blood,

729
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:52,199
and let future generations remember our glory.

730
00:40:52,639 --> 00:40:54,760
Today, for our party and country,

731
00:40:55,239 --> 00:40:56,480
we press forward without hesitation.

732
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,000
Without hesitation!

733
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,039
Without hesitation!

734
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:00,119
Without hesitation!

735
00:41:02,639 --> 00:41:03,480
Let's go!

736
00:41:14,159 --> 00:41:14,960
Xie Jun'an

737
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,599
What exactly are you trying to do?

738
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:20,800
Let's stop here.

739
00:41:21,079 --> 00:41:21,840
Okay.

740
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:26,800
Thanks a lot.

741
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:27,440
Thank you.

742
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,320
I'll help you gather them.

743
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,079
It's not to send them to their deaths.

744
00:41:41,679 --> 00:41:43,119
You gave them guns.

745
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,199
Do you know that?

746
00:41:44,239 --> 00:41:45,480
Some of them

747
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:46,840
have never even touched a gun.

748
00:41:47,679 --> 00:41:50,079
At least they know how to use a pull-pin grenade.

749
00:41:50,559 --> 00:41:51,400
What do you mean?

750
00:41:53,559 --> 00:41:54,800
Stop hesitating.

751
00:41:55,559 --> 00:41:56,599
At critical moments,

752
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:58,000
you have to make quick decisions.

753
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:58,679
Wait.

754
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:00,960
You're going to storm the Seamen's Club?

755
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:02,719
Xie Jun'an
