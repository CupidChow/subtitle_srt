1
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,079
I'll help you gather them.

2
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,840
It's not to send them to their deaths.

3
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:50,879
You gave them guns.

4
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:51,959
Do you know that?

5
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,239
Some of them

6
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:54,599
have never even touched a gun.

7
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,840
But they all know how to use a pull-pin grenade.

8
00:01:58,319 --> 00:01:59,159
What do you mean?

9
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:02,560
Stop hesitating.

10
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:04,359
At critical moments,

11
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:05,760
you have to make quick decisions.

12
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,439
Wait.

13
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:08,719
You're going to storm the Seamen's Club?

14
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:10,479
Xie Jun'an.

15
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,159
Are you crazy?

16
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,360
Crazy?

17
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:16,039
I like that word.

18
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:16,879
That way,

19
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:18,960
no one will anticipate my actions.

20
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,439
But those kids—

21
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:22,280
those kids will die for nothing.

22
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,879
Stop being so sentimental.

23
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,560
If we don't destroy the Trinity list now,

24
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:27,719
even more kids will die in the future.

25
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:35,000
Uncle.

26
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,400
What's going on?

27
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,039
It's nothing.

28
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:40,879
It's nothing.

29
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:17,479
Hello

30
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:18,400
Take a look at the Garden Hotel

31
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:03,800
Stop the car.

32
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:01,439
Come in.

33
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,519
Sorry to bother you.

34
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,319
What is it?

35
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,519
Saburou Shoda sent a message.

36
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:10,600
At the Seamen's Club,

37
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,959
a large number of anti-Japanese activists have appeared.

38
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,560
How is that possible?

39
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,639
Hello?

40
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:29,519
This is Mizuno.

41
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:32,839
What's going on?

42
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,560
Understood.

43
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,279
Send word to Takagi.

44
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:39,399
Lead a team to the Seamen's Club immediately.

45
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:39,959
Yes, sir.

46
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,560
What exactly is happening outside?

47
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,839
Kill them all for me.

48
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:32,759
Get up.

49
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,080
What are you doing?

50
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,080
What are you going to do?

51
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:41,039
If you go, you'll just be throwing your life away.

52
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:46,519
Don't.

53
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:47,759
Don't.

54
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,559
Mr. Asai

55
00:09:41,559 --> 00:09:43,519
You were right after all.

56
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,879
Yesterday, I

57
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,519
didn’t I already tell you?

58
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:48,200
None of this is just a coincidence.

59
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,879
It’s very unfortunate.

60
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:53,200
Takagi is too stubborn.

61
00:09:54,039 --> 00:09:55,080
But fortunately,

62
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,240
it didn’t lead to a major problem.

63
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,159
Mizuno

64
00:09:59,159 --> 00:10:00,840
Do you have any thoughts now?

65
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,720
We really can’t stay here any longer.

66
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,639
Thank you for your hard work, Mr. Asai.

67
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,080
Please move to another place.

68
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:14,399
After you.

69
00:10:54,919 --> 00:10:56,120
The operation failed.

70
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,799
We didn't bring back a single person.

71
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:00,799
The mission wasn't accomplished.

72
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,000
There's only one possible outcome.

73
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:07,399
Twelve lives were lost.

74
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,279
It's all over, just like that.

75
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:10,480
I don't need you to remind me.

76
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:12,120
This debt

77
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,159
I will settle it with the Japanese.

78
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,879
If only you had listened to my advice,

79
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,519
you wouldn't have ended up like this.

80
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:18,759
If there had been any other way,

81
00:11:18,759 --> 00:11:20,440
do you think I would have done this?

82
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,000
No guns,

83
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,799
no people,

84
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:24,399
I could only watch as the list appeared.

85
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,000
I've done all I can.

86
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,480
Fifth Brother,

87
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,600
If Dai Chunfeng had handed over the Shanghai station to me earlier,

88
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,720
things wouldn't have ended up like this.

89
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,639
Fifth Brother,

90
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,600
However,

91
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,320
one thing is certain:

92
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,679
Mizuno Shingen has put Asai Hisashi under house arrest.

93
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:49,159
There must be a problem between them.

94
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,440
There's still a chance.

95
00:11:56,679 --> 00:11:57,679
There's still a chance.

96
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:00,039
Fifth Brother.

97
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,480
It's all over.

98
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:03,559
Stop being so stubborn.

99
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:04,600
Contact Dai Chunfeng.

100
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,440
Tell him to get me a gun.

101
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,200
And send me some men.

102
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,639
I will definitely kill Asai Shou.

103
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:09,000
I will stop Mizuno Shingen for sure.

104
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,200
And get the list.

105
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,039
Xie Jun'an.

106
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:12,120
Contact Dai Chunfeng.

107
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,000
Xie Jun'an.

108
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,240
Calm down.

109
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:17,720
Calm down.

110
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,879
The Seamen's Club was attacked.

111
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,360
These are the anti-Japanese activists who were killed.

112
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,639
We received the news as well.

113
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,600
I didn't expect the anti-Japanese activists to be so brazen.

114
00:12:36,919 --> 00:12:38,639
To cause such a big commotion.

115
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:40,720
In this world,

116
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,600
there really are such coincidences.

117
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:44,960
The director just hosted a dinner nearby last night.

118
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,360
And then something like this happens early the next morning.

119
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:48,480
Mr. Takagi,

120
00:12:48,919 --> 00:12:50,240
what exactly are you trying to say?

121
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,200
There's no need to be so indirect.

122
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,720
I'm just curious

123
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,279
how the news leaked out so quickly.

124
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,200
Mr. Takagi,

125
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,039
I don't understand what you mean by that.

126
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:02,759
The attack on the Seamen's Club

127
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:04,759
has nothing to do with us.

128
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,360
Director,

129
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,679
why ask questions you already know the answer to?

130
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,879
The bureau chief isn't here to assign blame.

131
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,759
After all, we are allies.

132
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:14,799
But those from the Military Bureau are not.

133
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,519
The bureau chief said

134
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,559
regarding their source of intelligence,

135
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:20,240
he hopes everyone

136
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,519
will conduct a thorough self-investigation.

137
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,000
Director,

138
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:34,399
it seems

139
00:13:34,919 --> 00:13:37,559
someone has become an informant for the Military Bureau.

140
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:39,879
But it still shouldn't have happened so quickly.

141
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:42,120
We only received the news yesterday as well.

142
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,320
Senior Asai,

143
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:28,399
you know the current situation, right?

144
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,399
Mizuno,

145
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,120
I can't believe you're asking me that.

146
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:35,440
There's been major trouble in Shanghai.

147
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,720
You've experienced it yourself, haven't you?

148
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,039
If you

149
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,720
that idiot subordinate of yours

150
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,480
had listened to my advice back then,

151
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:46,679
before this incident happened,

152
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:48,480
I would have already transferred out safely, right?

153
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,759
Sir, your arrival in Shanghai

154
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:51,480
inevitably

155
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,840
was bound to stir up a storm.

156
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:55,360
Looking back on this incident,

157
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,840
it was indeed my mistake.

158
00:14:57,039 --> 00:14:58,639
That's true.

159
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,399
Always known for

160
00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:04,480
your meticulousness, even you, Mizuno, were careless.

161
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,919
Now, whatever happens,

162
00:15:06,919 --> 00:15:09,679
I can understand it.

163
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:23,480
The information about the Seamen's Club

164
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,679
was leaked by you.

165
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,480
Where did you get that information?

166
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,679
You don't need to know.

167
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,919
Why did you launch a rash attack in the morning?

168
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:33,080
Why didn't you discuss it with me beforehand?

169
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,759
Scorpio makes his own decisions.

170
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,720
It's not for you or me to worry about.

171
00:15:37,879 --> 00:15:39,120
No need to worry.

172
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,639
Headquarters had just learned about the Seamen's Club,

173
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:44,039
and the next day it was leaked.

174
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:45,000
The Military Bureau's people

175
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,080
even launched a suicide attack.

176
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,399
Now Li Hanzhi

177
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,559
suspects once again that there's a mole in our ranks.

178
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:52,200
Now, I'm afraid he's already watching

179
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,559
every single one of us.

180
00:15:56,559 --> 00:15:59,120
The list is no longer a secret.

181
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,159
Both No. 76 and Nanjing

182
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:03,480
are already aware of it.

183
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:05,720
Senior Asai,

184
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,480
I ask you once more,

185
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,519
please let me get the list quickly.

186
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,559
Listen,

187
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:15,559
this isn't what we agreed on, is it?

188
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:16,960
Senior Asai,

189
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:19,000
you have your own political beliefs.

190
00:16:19,159 --> 00:16:21,039
I know and I understand you.

191
00:16:21,159 --> 00:16:24,240
The military has been desperately searching for your whereabouts.

192
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:25,600
I understand.

193
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,159
Senior Asai, from beginning to end,

194
00:16:27,159 --> 00:16:28,399
you have always kept your word.

195
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:29,279
If only

196
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:30,919
you could do as I suggested,

197
00:16:30,919 --> 00:16:32,320
and work with me,

198
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:33,519
wouldn't this

199
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:36,200
be exactly what you have been hoping for?

200
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:41,159
Thank you, Mizuno,

201
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:42,799
for your sincerity.

202
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:45,480
Senior,

203
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,639
there's still time.

204
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:52,559
Please take your time to think it over.

205
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,559
Scorpio must have his reasons.

206
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,200
Something must have happened.

207
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,880
Otherwise, he wouldn't act so rashly.

208
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,319
Scorpio has already lost his mind.

209
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:17,000
Ever since the fall of the Shanghai station,

210
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,920
he has lost all reason.

211
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:21,880
There are twelve bodies lying in the yard right now.

212
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:24,519
All of them are kids who barely ever held a gun.

213
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:26,480
Even if the times are tough,

214
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:28,279
even if we've lost our support,

215
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,880
bringing them here

216
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:32,279
is no different from sending them to their deaths.

217
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,720
Scorpio is gambling.

218
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,799
But we simply can't afford to lose.

219
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:31,720
Go get some rest.

220
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,640
Today, I

221
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:39,000
went to the Seamen's Club.

222
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:43,839
Did he ask you to join the operation too?

223
00:18:44,119 --> 00:18:44,920
No.

224
00:18:45,799 --> 00:18:47,400
I went on my own.

225
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,480
Now, whenever I think about

226
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:54,200
those people falling one by one in front of me,

227
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,839
and that little girl,

228
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,880
she was so young.

229
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,920
They reminded me of my senior, He.

230
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:04,799
Whenever I think about all this,

231
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,079
I can hardly breathe.

232
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:11,440
I hope they

233
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,759
did not sacrifice themselves in vain.

234
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,519
It's completely meaningless.

235
00:19:21,759 --> 00:19:22,960
Old Xie has gone mad.

236
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,720
Just to get that list,

237
00:19:26,119 --> 00:19:28,200
he actually sent those kids to the battlefield.

238
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,279
I can't even bear to think about their eyes now.

239
00:19:33,079 --> 00:19:34,119
That look in their eyes,

240
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,480
as if they've been brainwashed.

241
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,359
There's only fanaticism,

242
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,880
no emotion at all.

243
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:44,200
Have we really reached a dead end?

244
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,680
I don't know either.

245
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,279
Before I met you,

246
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,160
I kept asking myself,

247
00:19:56,599 --> 00:19:58,440
what am I really holding on to?

248
00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:01,839
Is it to avenge my parents

249
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:03,079
who died at the hands of the Japanese?

250
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,480
But after all these years,

251
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,519
I've only grown more numb.

252
00:20:11,319 --> 00:20:12,680
Old Xie has changed too.

253
00:20:12,839 --> 00:20:15,279
He's become more and more like a stranger to me.

254
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:17,279
And my friends,

255
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,279
one by one, they've sacrificed themselves.

256
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,160
And what about me?

257
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,000
I don't even know what path lies ahead for me.

258
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,440
And also,

259
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,839
whenever I think about

260
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,640
people like Wang Mutian,

261
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,000
who have all betrayed us,

262
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:35,839
I feel even more hopeless.

263
00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:45,519
Things have been so chaotic lately.

264
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,200
You're tired too.

265
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:48,839
Go get some rest.

266
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:50,039
No.

267
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:52,559
Stay and talk with me.

268
00:20:52,759 --> 00:20:55,000
There are so many things I want to tell you.

269
00:20:55,799 --> 00:20:57,759
I just never knew how to start.

270
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,519
But if I don't say it today,

271
00:21:02,279 --> 00:21:04,240
I'm afraid I won't get another chance.

272
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:08,839
Alright.

273
00:21:10,279 --> 00:21:11,680
Let's sit down and talk.

274
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,119
Excuse me,

275
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:47,079
what time is it now?

276
00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:48,880
I'm sorry,

277
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,319
Chief Mizuno has given orders.

278
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:51,960
According to the rules, they can't speak with you.

279
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,279
Since it's the rule,

280
00:21:55,279 --> 00:21:57,359
there's no need to apologize to me.

281
00:21:58,319 --> 00:22:02,039
What delicious food have you prepared for me in the box today?

282
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:03,400
The director gave instructions.

283
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,200
This is your favorite tempura.

284
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,119
Tempura!

285
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,640
With good food,

286
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,640
how can there not be good sake?

287
00:22:24,119 --> 00:22:25,759
It's too cold.

288
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,119
So,

289
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:28,880
could you get me a bottle of Japanese sake?

290
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,160
Just one bottle is enough.

291
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,720
Thank you.

292
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,440
You know,

293
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,119
ever since I met you,

294
00:22:44,119 --> 00:22:46,559
I've known where my future path lies.

295
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,880
Because you gave me hope.

296
00:22:53,759 --> 00:22:54,720
I want to protect you.

297
00:22:56,759 --> 00:22:58,279
I stayed by Old Xie's side

298
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,279
because I was afraid that if one day

299
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,559
he discovered your true identity,

300
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,039
he would try to harm you.

301
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,920
I need to keep an eye on him.

302
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:08,599
If that day really comes,

303
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,720
I will do everything I can to protect you.

304
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,480
Because I promised you.

305
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,440
I want to make sure you leave safely.

306
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,559
Maybe this

307
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,480
is the reason I keep going now.

308
00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:28,319
Nian Ci

309
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:32,960
The mission isn't complete.

310
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,319
I won't leave.

311
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,559
I know what you're thinking.

312
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,599
But you need to understand,

313
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,079
Every day that I can close my eyes

314
00:23:43,599 --> 00:23:44,640
and open them again

315
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:47,319
is already a luxury.

316
00:23:48,839 --> 00:23:50,440
Of course I know that.

317
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,599
When the country is in peril,

318
00:23:54,279 --> 00:23:55,279
how can there be a home?

319
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,759
But do you know

320
00:23:58,759 --> 00:24:00,960
I just want to face it together with you,

321
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,920
to fight by your side until the end,

322
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:04,759
even if it means dying.

323
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,200
I still want to be with you.

324
00:24:10,519 --> 00:24:11,680
I just don't know

325
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,119
how long Old Tan will keep testing me.

326
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:18,839
Tests always take some time.

327
00:24:20,119 --> 00:24:21,160
Be patient.

328
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:23,759
I'll wait.

329
00:24:24,519 --> 00:24:25,599
I'll prove

330
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:28,119
my faith isn't just a momentary passion.

331
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:31,599
I want to become a true comrade with you.

332
00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:32,799
A fellow soldier.

333
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:34,799
Once the mission is complete,

334
00:24:36,319 --> 00:24:37,759
we'll return to Yan'an together.

335
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:41,839
Alright.

336
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,000
As long as we're alive.

337
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:11,079
You can't even deliver wine properly.

338
00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:12,359
I'm sorry.

339
00:25:12,359 --> 00:25:13,759
Are you an idiot?

340
00:25:13,759 --> 00:25:15,039
Hurry up and clean this up.

341
00:25:46,599 --> 00:25:48,319
It's over, it's over, it's over.

342
00:25:48,319 --> 00:25:49,720
Quick, report to Chief Mizuno.

343
00:26:06,079 --> 00:26:10,000
The tree wishes to be still

344
00:26:10,759 --> 00:26:13,880
but the wind does not cease.

345
00:26:15,759 --> 00:26:17,000
Mizuno.

346
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,839
Farewell.

347
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,200
Stop the car.

348
00:26:45,359 --> 00:26:46,519
Stop right there.

349
00:26:46,759 --> 00:26:48,240
Block him.

350
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,000
Chief.

351
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,759
The prisoner has escaped from jail.

352
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,440
What are you all doing?

353
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:44,880
Is the information accurate?

354
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:45,680
Don't worry.

355
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,839
I've already sent our men to follow him.

356
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,200
He's definitely here.

357
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:55,680
Director Cui.

358
00:27:57,279 --> 00:27:57,880
Chief.

359
00:27:58,039 --> 00:27:59,039
There's a situation.

360
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,039
It seems someone has escaped.

361
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:02,880
The Japanese side is already in chaos.

362
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:05,720
Tell our people

363
00:28:05,839 --> 00:28:08,000
to keep a close watch on the nearby streets.

364
00:28:08,279 --> 00:28:09,079
Yes.

365
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,079
Go.

366
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:10,880
Yes.

367
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,680
Do you think our luck

368
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:19,279
could really be this good?

369
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,799
We just got here,

370
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:22,599
and Asai Hisashi already escaped.

371
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:23,920
Chief.

372
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:26,359
This is what they call "timing is better than being early."

373
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,240
Now it all depends on the Japanese

374
00:28:28,319 --> 00:28:30,160
whether they'll let us get involved in this matter.

375
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,079
As long as we have a reason,

376
00:28:32,359 --> 00:28:34,119
why would we worry about not being able to get involved?

377
00:28:34,759 --> 00:28:35,720
It seems

378
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,400
I should meet this Mizuno myself.

379
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:39,680
Yes.

380
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,440
Such a heavily guarded military police prison

381
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,480
how did it let an unarmed old man

382
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,240
escape?

383
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,599
I deserve to be punished.

384
00:28:52,599 --> 00:28:53,920
I was careless.

385
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:54,799
Even though we switched the utensils to wooden ones,

386
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:56,240
he still found a loophole.

387
00:29:13,599 --> 00:29:14,319
Chief,

388
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:16,039
the Special Operations Headquarters has arrived.

389
00:29:43,079 --> 00:29:43,880
Director Li,

390
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,519
you're usually so busy,

391
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,119
but today you have some free time.

392
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:48,799
What's with all this commotion?

393
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,039
There's no other way.

394
00:29:50,519 --> 00:29:51,759
The higher-ups have given us heavy tasks.

395
00:29:51,759 --> 00:29:53,000
The responsibility on my shoulders is great.

396
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:55,119
I have to handle things personally.

397
00:29:55,119 --> 00:29:56,359
So I came here myself.

398
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,920
The Special Operations Headquarters has a new mission.

399
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,279
How come I haven't heard about it?

400
00:30:00,359 --> 00:30:02,599
Mr. Mizuno, you really are forgetful.

401
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:03,359
The first wave

402
00:30:03,359 --> 00:30:05,839
of the joint announcement to capture the fugitive Asai Shou

403
00:30:05,839 --> 00:30:07,200
has already been released.

404
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:08,119
Here,

405
00:30:08,119 --> 00:30:10,480
let Mr. Mizuno take a look.

406
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,119
Of course I know about this.

407
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,759
But bringing the fugitive search here,

408
00:30:14,839 --> 00:30:15,640
what does that mean?

409
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,839
You're blaming me again.

410
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,400
How would I dare to suspect

411
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,920
that Mr. Mizuno is harboring a fugitive?

412
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,640
We just heard the news ourselves.

413
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,920
They said there are traces of the suspect nearby.

414
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:29,079
So I brought some people to try our luck.

415
00:30:29,519 --> 00:30:30,920
Unexpectedly, as soon as we arrived,

416
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,839
it really does seem like something is going on.

417
00:30:35,839 --> 00:30:38,400
It's just that one deserter ran away from under my command.

418
00:30:38,519 --> 00:30:39,720
But Director Li,

419
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:42,319
you made such a big fuss over just a rumor.

420
00:30:42,319 --> 00:30:43,759
You even came in person.

421
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:44,960
I didn't expect that.

422
00:30:45,599 --> 00:30:47,279
Are you always this spontaneous?

423
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:48,880
I wouldn't say spontaneous.

424
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,039
I just like to take risks.

425
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,000
If I'm lucky today,

426
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,440
it would be a great achievement for both me and the new government.

427
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:56,519
That would be a huge accomplishment.

428
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,119
Since this is a search operation,

429
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,119
what are we waiting for?

430
00:31:03,079 --> 00:31:04,279
We Chinese

431
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:05,640
value proper etiquette.

432
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:08,079
So we should at least say hello when we arrive.

433
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,680
Since Mr. Mizuno

434
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,759
has already stationed troops here,

435
00:31:11,799 --> 00:31:13,440
I can rest assured.

436
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:16,519
We'll search and set up defenses nearby.

437
00:31:17,319 --> 00:31:18,440
Who knows,

438
00:31:18,759 --> 00:31:20,400
we might even help Mr. Mizuno

439
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,319
find that deserter.

440
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:23,400
Yes, yes.

441
00:31:26,119 --> 00:31:27,279
Well then, Mr. Mizuno,

442
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:29,680
sorry to trouble you.

443
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,440
Let's find a place nearby

444
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,240
and set up our office here.

445
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,359
Call Liang Shuo over.

446
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,039
Yes.

447
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,000
Let's go.

448
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:43,359
Let's go too.

449
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,319
Chief,

450
00:31:55,559 --> 00:31:56,960
what should I do?

451
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,799
They really came at just the right time.

452
00:32:00,359 --> 00:32:02,119
Who leaked the information?

453
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:14,680
Judging by Shingen Mizuno's reaction,

454
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,359
I can conclude

455
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:18,119
that your guess

456
00:32:18,119 --> 00:32:20,200
is most likely correct.

457
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,599
And as for the deserter who escaped,

458
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,039
it's a clear case of trying to cover things up.

459
00:32:27,359 --> 00:32:28,240
What a pity.

460
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,920
We were a step too late.

461
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,759
Not late at all.

462
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,240
We couldn't have

463
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,039
searched in front of Shingen Mizuno.

464
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,400
The situation is still unclear.

465
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,920
That actually gives us an opportunity.

466
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,240
Toshi Asai has escaped.

467
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,279
Now everyone has a chance to catch him.

468
00:32:43,559 --> 00:32:44,960
The opportunity is open to all.

469
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,279
It's equal for everyone.

470
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:47,480
So,

471
00:32:48,359 --> 00:32:49,720
from now on,

472
00:32:50,359 --> 00:32:51,720
capturing Toshi Asai

473
00:32:52,079 --> 00:32:54,880
is our top priority.

474
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:24,559
What are you daydreaming about?

475
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,720
Sister-in-law, you startled me.

476
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:30,079
You...

477
00:33:30,079 --> 00:33:31,519
If you keep being so quiet,

478
00:33:31,799 --> 00:33:33,960
I'll start thinking you're sick.

479
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,400
No, I'm not.

480
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,160
When was I not talking?

481
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,960
I can tell.

482
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,000
You have something on your mind.

483
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,279
What's wrong?

484
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:46,240
Is it that rascal Liang Shuo

485
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,240
bullying you again?

486
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:48,519
No.

487
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,000
He's been so busy these past couple of days

488
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,960
that he's pulled two all-nighters at headquarters.

489
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,279
I haven't even seen him.

490
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,759
How could he have time to bully me?

491
00:33:58,680 --> 00:33:59,720
That's how men are.

492
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,519
They always get like this when they're working.

493
00:34:01,559 --> 00:34:03,200
Old Cui is the same these days.

494
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:04,960
He just got home yesterday,

495
00:34:05,119 --> 00:34:07,119
and then headquarters called him away again.

496
00:34:07,559 --> 00:34:09,519
He barely had time to sit down.

497
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,440
He didn't even have time to say a word to me.

498
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,079
So about your pregnancy,

499
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:15,320
Brother Cui still doesn't know?

500
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,840
Something this important

501
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:20,840
you have to find the right time

502
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,639
to sit down and talk to him properly.

503
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,039
Something this important

504
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:25,360
really needs to be discussed properly.

505
00:34:48,039 --> 00:34:49,239
Mr. Li is here.

506
00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:49,880
Yes.

507
00:34:50,039 --> 00:34:52,639
Last time, I had a great conversation with Miss Xie.

508
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:54,199
I wonder if she could

509
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:56,159
recommend a few more products to me.

510
00:34:57,519 --> 00:34:59,079
Madam, all the goods in the back have been checked.

511
00:34:59,079 --> 00:35:00,480
Please come over and take a look.

512
00:35:01,679 --> 00:35:03,920
Mr. Li, I'll excuse myself for now.

513
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,400
Yuxin,

514
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,519
please quickly recommend some more products to Mr. Li.

515
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,840
Okay, I'll be right there.

516
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,000
You really fit the role of a good friend.

517
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,880
You played it quite well.

518
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,400
I'll take that as a compliment.

519
00:35:26,599 --> 00:35:27,400
Go ahead.

520
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,800
Any new updates from Liang Shuo?

521
00:35:30,239 --> 00:35:31,039
No.

522
00:35:32,239 --> 00:35:33,039
Nothing.

523
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:35,960
You're mad at me.

524
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,159
What do you think?

525
00:35:37,639 --> 00:35:38,840
You recklessly

526
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,079
pushed twelve lives into the fire.

527
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,159
Old Xie,

528
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,599
this is how your path keeps getting narrower.

529
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,119
Fine.

530
00:35:49,079 --> 00:35:50,280
People from the Xie family

531
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,480
should at least have this much backbone.

532
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,159
Otherwise, we don't deserve our family name.

533
00:35:55,519 --> 00:35:56,920
As long as the mission gets done,

534
00:35:57,559 --> 00:35:59,800
I can overlook your disrespect.

535
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:03,039
What mission?

536
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,599
What are you planning now?

537
00:36:08,119 --> 00:36:09,639
I want Liang Shuo

538
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,159
to find a way to locate Asai Shou.

539
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,079
Then get rid of him.

540
00:36:17,239 --> 00:36:18,320
Get rid of him?

541
00:36:19,639 --> 00:36:20,800
What about the list?

542
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:23,199
There's still no sign of the list.

543
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,280
That list is a ticking time bomb.

544
00:36:26,719 --> 00:36:28,559
Asai Shou is the fuse.

545
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,400
As long as the fuse is gone,

546
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,199
the bomb will never go off.

547
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:49,719
Yuxin

548
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,360
Mr. Li has left?

549
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:51,920
Yes.

550
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,079
He said there was something

551
00:36:53,079 --> 00:36:54,239
he suddenly remembered he hadn't done yet.

552
00:36:54,239 --> 00:36:54,920
So he left.

553
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,079
Sister-in-law,

554
00:36:57,599 --> 00:36:58,800
can I use the phone in our shop?

555
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,079
Can I use it for a moment?

556
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,159
Just go ahead and use it.

557
00:37:02,199 --> 00:37:03,719
No need to be so polite with me.

558
00:37:03,719 --> 00:37:04,360
Okay.

559
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,199
Hello?

560
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,199
Hello?

561
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:25,000
Miss Xie,

562
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,400
I'm looking for Liang Shuo.

563
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,199
The boss went out with Director Cui.

564
00:37:29,199 --> 00:37:31,639
