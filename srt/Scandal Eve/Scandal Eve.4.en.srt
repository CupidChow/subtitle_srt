1
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:14,347
I hear your sales are doing quite well.

2
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:18,935
Thanks to your help, they have been
rising since the Kuryu Fujiwara scandal.

3
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:22,021
Please, it's all thanks
to your skill as editor-in-chief.

4
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:25,692
Thank you for next year's
calendar deal as well.

5
00:00:25,775 --> 00:00:27,235
The executives are thrilled.

6
00:00:27,318 --> 00:00:29,154
I expect you'll be promoted soon.

7
00:00:29,738 --> 00:00:32,782
Perhaps you'll become
the next managing director?

8
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:34,701
Who can say?

9
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:37,120
Incidentally…

10
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:42,083
I was hoping Buncho
would have an interview with our Aso.

11
00:00:43,042 --> 00:00:45,503
As part of marketing
for his international debut?

12
00:00:46,087 --> 00:00:47,672
Can I count on you?

13
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:49,048
Anytime.

14
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:54,512
I'll be sure to return
the favor however I can.

15
00:00:56,681 --> 00:00:58,183
Let us both…

16
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:02,020
make the best of this partnership.

17
00:01:03,813 --> 00:01:04,689
Agreed.

18
00:01:13,656 --> 00:01:15,992
Thank you for the generous meal.

19
00:01:29,672 --> 00:01:30,799
Excuse me.

20
00:01:42,393 --> 00:01:43,478
Hello.

21
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:45,855
Any progress on that matter?

22
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:50,568
I talked to her last night.

23
00:01:51,736 --> 00:01:54,239
I'll get right to the point.

24
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:57,283
Our agency's understanding

25
00:01:57,367 --> 00:02:01,746
is that Hideto Aso did not commit
any kind of sexual assault.

26
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:05,250
We're told that
it was entirely consensual.

27
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:09,129
If you were to try
and publicize this allegation,

28
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:13,091
we might be forced to pursue
a lawsuit against you for defamation.

29
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:18,555
But if you're willing to settle
this matter outside of court,

30
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:24,394
we will compensate you for any
emotional distress you may have suffered

31
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:26,354
as a result of this misunderstanding.

32
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:29,149
Can you agree to a settlement?

33
00:02:33,736 --> 00:02:36,865
I need some time to think.

34
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:39,159
I expect she'll agree.

35
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:40,743
Expect?

36
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:43,079
She said she needed time to think.

37
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,789
She'll respond at a later date.

38
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:49,377
We'll start marketing efforts
for Aso's international debut soon.

39
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:52,547
You do understand
that scandals of this nature

40
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:55,216
are even more taboo overseas
than in Japan, yes?

41
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,301
Of course, ma'am.

42
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:57,677
This is a critical period.

43
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,179
We can't afford any mistakes.

44
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:01,639
I know.

45
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:03,600
Excuse me.

46
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:07,103
Can you send room service to Room 3908?

47
00:03:07,186 --> 00:03:08,313
Yes, sir.

48
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:11,566
Where are you?

49
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:15,820
The Royal Prince Hotel.

50
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:38,551
Is it true?

51
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:40,845
Mr. Aso committed sexual assault,

52
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:44,015
and Fujiwara's scandal was leaked
to cover that up?

53
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:46,017
We don't have any conclusive proof.

54
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,978
But everything would make sense
if that was true.

55
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:52,273
It's not unheard of for big agencies
to make deals with publishers

56
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:57,654
to suppress a scandal by providing them
with another scandal in exchange.

57
00:03:58,529 --> 00:04:02,909
The person behind the cover-up
was most likely their CEO, Yoko Kodama.

58
00:04:02,992 --> 00:04:04,619
The boss herself?

59
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:07,372
Aso is the face of their agency.

60
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:10,833
She'd stop at nothing
to keep him out of trouble.

61
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:13,294
Unbelievable.

62
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:15,797
That's just horrible.

63
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:17,548
Mori.

64
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:22,679
If what you're saying is true,
Aso's agency covered up his sexual assault

65
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:25,974
by selling out Mr. Fujiwara
and destroying his career.

66
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:28,434
Everything they've done is awful.

67
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:30,311
They can't just get away with it!

68
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:32,355
They won't.

69
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:34,274
Of course not.

70
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:36,150
Then…

71
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:37,360
Ma'am.

72
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:42,407
Are you going to expose
Aso's sexual assault allegations?

73
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:46,869
That's too reckless!

74
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:50,206
We're already being persecuted
by Kodama Productions!

75
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,708
If we defy them any further,

76
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:55,128
they will take more severe measures,
and we won't be able to survive!

77
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:58,298
Hirata from Weekly Buncho
said she'd cooperate.

78
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:01,718
You mean the reporter
who wrote the article on Fujiwara?

79
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:02,844
We can't trust her!

80
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:06,639
If we don't do anything about it,
our agency is done for.

81
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:12,937
And beyond that,
this doesn't concern only us.

82
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:17,900
This case is just the tip of the iceberg.

83
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:22,530
Complaints raised by those
who've been unjustly hurt

84
00:05:22,613 --> 00:05:25,283
are being erased
by favoritism and manipulation.

85
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:28,328
We can't just sit back and let it happen!

86
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:36,210
I refuse to avert my eyes.

87
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:49,682
Morning.

88
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:51,559
-Good morning.
-Morning.

89
00:05:51,642 --> 00:05:53,227
Good morning.

90
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:07,450
Ninomiya, can I talk to you?

91
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:08,409
Yeah.

92
00:06:27,386 --> 00:06:29,097
So? What is it?

93
00:06:33,392 --> 00:06:34,393
What is this?

94
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:37,647
INVOICE AMOUNT: 3,000,000 YEN

95
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,482
Where did you…

96
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:41,150
I found it in your room.

97
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:51,452
Three million yen
from the editing department.

98
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:54,747
Says it's payment for a draft,
but the amount is too high.

99
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:00,211
Were you bribed by the editor-in-chief?

100
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:04,715
-I don't know what you mean.
-Don't play dumb!

101
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:09,929
You tried to write an article
on Aso's sexual assault.

102
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:13,891
But the editor-in-chief is connected
to Yoko Kodama and stopped you.

103
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:16,102
Three million yen for your silence.

104
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:18,354
And to the editor-in-chief,

105
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:22,358
Yoko Kodama offered a scandal on Fujiwara
she had bought off someone in the past,

106
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,110
which I wrote an article on.

107
00:07:25,653 --> 00:07:27,780
You knew it all, but you kept quiet.

108
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:28,823
Am I wrong?

109
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:35,705
You won't deny it?

110
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:42,295
I'll follow up
on Hideto Aso's sexual assault allegation.

111
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:44,505
Give me the informant's contact info.

112
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:46,591
I can't.

113
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:51,596
Did you agree not to tell anyone,
so you could get the money?

114
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:57,059
How hard do you think it was

115
00:07:57,143 --> 00:08:00,104
for the victim to speak up
about what happened?

116
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:03,274
"Surely Buncho would let the world know."

117
00:08:03,357 --> 00:08:06,152
Have you considered
how she felt, being betrayed like that?

118
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:16,245
You could've taken it to another publisher
if ours wouldn't work.

119
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:17,163
So why?

120
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:19,373
I didn't want to back off either.

121
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:22,126
-Then why--
-I don't have a company protecting me.

122
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:24,003
If Kodama Productions wanted,

123
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:26,130
a freelancer like me
would have nowhere to go!

124
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,801
You should stop too.

125
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:32,845
You'll get kicked out of the company.

126
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:37,433
Is that all?

127
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:39,602
Fine.

128
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:48,110
I think it's almost certain

129
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:51,280
that Kodama Productions forced
Buncho to suppress the article.

130
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:53,115
Are you sure?

131
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:56,786
I'll try to find a way to contact
the informant who came to Buncho,

132
00:08:56,869 --> 00:09:00,498
but there's a risk, our editor-in-chief
could fill Yoko Kodama in on my moves,

133
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:02,875
so I can't be too conspicuous.

134
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:03,960
I understand.

135
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:06,546
We'll try to take action on our end too,

136
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:08,631
but I'm curious how Kodama Pro will act.

137
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:12,176
Agreed. I'm certain that they will try
to track down the informant

138
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,845
and try to settle or buy her silence.

139
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:17,765
We have to make sure we don't fall behind.

140
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:26,148
Mr. Aso, Mr. Ichinose, it's time.

141
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:29,569
This way.

142
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:31,195
Good to go.

143
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:34,699
-Ready here.
-Thank you.

144
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:48,588
SAKI IOKA
ONE MISSED CALL

145
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,052
-Good to go.
-Thank you.

146
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:21,871
Ioka.

147
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:27,585
-Sorry I'm late.
-No, I'm sorry for calling so suddenly.

148
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:28,753
This way.

149
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:37,553
So what did you want to talk about?

150
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,265
I heard through the grapevine

151
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:45,561
that a scandal on Mr. Aso
might be coming out.

152
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:47,688
What kind?

153
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:49,273
I don't know that much.

154
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:52,151
But I hear it was leaked recently
by someone involved in it,

155
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:55,488
and Buncho is trying
to verify it right now.

156
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:57,907
That got me a little concerned.

157
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,078
You okay?

158
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:07,083
Yeah. It's probably just some rumor.

159
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:11,128
I would've heard before you
if it was something like that.

160
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:14,548
-That's true.
-Yeah.

161
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:16,133
Here you go.

162
00:11:17,676 --> 00:11:18,636
Thanks.

163
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:20,554
And you, ma'am?

164
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:23,099
I'm good, thanks.

165
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:37,947
The number you have dialed can't respond--

166
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:54,130
HIDETO ASO

167
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:01,387
Good afternoon.

168
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:04,348
Man, I'm tired.

169
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:07,268
-Mizuguchi.
-Yes?

170
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:10,855
What was she like? That woman
who met Mr. Ninomiya a while back?

171
00:12:10,938 --> 00:12:13,315
-What?
-Did you see her? Know her name?

172
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,443
I only saw her for an instant.

173
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:17,111
Right.

174
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:20,656
Wait, let me guess.

175
00:12:20,739 --> 00:12:22,450
Are you into Mr. Ninomiya?

176
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:24,076
What?

177
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:27,246
Now I get it. So it's like that.

178
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:29,206
-No, it's not.
-Yamamoto!

179
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:30,207
Sir?

180
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:36,130
By the way, did you hear?

181
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:37,840
The editor-in-chief
is going to be promoted

182
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:39,550
to managing director.

183
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:42,803
-What?
-Becoming a managing director at that age?

184
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:44,847
How do you think he managed that?

185
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:49,518
Hirata!

186
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:50,478
Coming.

187
00:12:57,902 --> 00:13:01,530
This is still off-the-record,
but Kodama Productions' Hideto Aso

188
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:05,075
will be starring
in a joint US-Japan drama next year.

189
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:07,161
I see.

190
00:13:07,244 --> 00:13:11,749
We're going to run an interview with Aso
at the same time as its announcement.

191
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:13,042
You go do it.

192
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,127
What? Me?

193
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:18,339
They asked for you.

194
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:23,052
Time is 1:00 p.m. tomorrow. Got it?

195
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:25,846
Yes.

196
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:38,067
Pardon me.

197
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:46,784
I told you last time not to visit me here.

198
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:52,081
Did you tell anyone
about what we discussed last time?

199
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:54,750
-I did not.
- Are you sure?

200
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:57,836
Of course. Why would I?

201
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:03,384
I await a good response
to the settlement offer.

202
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:09,306
We'd prefer to avoid
taking any forceful measures.

203
00:14:14,311 --> 00:14:16,772
-Can I get the bill?
-Yes, sir.

204
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:28,868
Sorry to startle you.

205
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:36,917
I can't get into details here,

206
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:41,005
but I have something important
to discuss with you.

207
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:46,886
PROOF OF RECOLLECTION

208
00:14:58,188 --> 00:15:01,817
KAGAWA
IT WENT WELL

209
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:31,180
Ms. Hirata.

210
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:33,057
Sorry to keep you waiting.

211
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,559
It's nice to see you again.

212
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:42,232
Why me?

213
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:45,277
Because you're a talented reporter.

214
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:49,782
That's why I'd love for you
to write an article for us.

215
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:53,494
I didn't realize
you had such a high opinion of my skills.

216
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:55,955
Take a seat. And please wait.

217
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:10,761
Nice to meet you.
I'm Saki Ioka, this agency's CEO.

218
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:14,181
This is Mr. Tozaki, our lawyer.

219
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:15,307
Nice to meet you.

220
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:17,476
A lawyer?

221
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:20,562
Ms. Riko,

222
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:27,277
I understand that you were once a talent
under the stage name Risa Hirayama,

223
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:29,822
affiliated with the agency MK Promotion.

224
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:32,616
That's correct.

225
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:37,830
If it's not too personal,
may I ask why you left?

226
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:40,374
That's…

227
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:43,293
Were you forced to leave
against your will?

228
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:54,138
We called you here today to ask you
about an incident you were a victim of.

229
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:56,181
Do you mean…

230
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,559
The incident with Hideto Aso.

231
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,108
When will you start filming in America?

232
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:09,111
What?

233
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:13,282
When will you start filming in America?

234
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:17,327
The filming itself starts in six months,

235
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:21,373
but there's other prep to be done,
so I'd like to go as soon as possible.

236
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:25,252
I understand that in this drama,

237
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:29,965
you'll be playing an anti-hero
who's both charming yet has a cruel side.

238
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,051
It should be new ground for you,

239
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:34,511
having mostly played
upright characters so far.

240
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:35,596
Indeed.

241
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:39,600
It seems the show will also have scenes
with extreme sexual content and violence.

242
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:41,727
Such scenes are included,

243
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:45,439
but I'm sure it will be
a challenging venture for me.

244
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:51,320
Do you see any part of yourself
in the character you'll be portraying?

245
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:57,367
For example, is there a different side
of you that you can't show to others?

246
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:06,502
Doesn't everyone have some hidden secret?

247
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:21,975
You took your story to a magazine
but it went nowhere, as I understand.

248
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:26,563
We suspect that Buncho's higher-ups

249
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:30,567
refrained from publishing it
on orders of Kodama Productions.

250
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:33,529
Shameful conduct for a press company.

251
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:36,865
It took great courage
for you to disclose it.

252
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:38,826
It must be frustrating.

253
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:45,874
Will you try one more time
to get an article published?

254
00:18:49,878 --> 00:18:52,798
It's unacceptable for a victim
to be forced to stay quiet.

255
00:18:53,423 --> 00:18:55,634
We'll help you in whatever way we can.

256
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:01,557
If you're willing--

257
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,684
I'm already done with it.

258
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:05,477
I'm going to settle.

259
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:10,440
Kodama Productions
reached out to me a while back.

260
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,152
And I figured it's been long enough.

261
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:14,361
So you're giving up?

262
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:20,701
Don't make it sound so simple.

263
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:25,080
I've already tried everything I could!

264
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:28,458
I talked to my manager,
my agency, and even Buncho.

265
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:30,002
Several times.

266
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:33,088
But nothing ever came of it.

267
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:37,134
I'm sure the police
won't take me seriously either.

268
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:42,181
I might as well take
the money and put this all behind me.

269
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:43,640
Is that wrong?

270
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:49,229
And people from Kodama Pro
have been coming to my place of work.

271
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:50,689
It's a huge bother.

272
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:53,483
So you'll agree to a settlement?

273
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:57,946
If you settle, you'll have to sign
a non-disclosure agreement,

274
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:01,074
which will forbid you
from ever going public with it.

275
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:04,578
Are you really okay with settling
despite those conditions?

276
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,918
Of course not.

277
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:14,630
Can you people even imagine it?

278
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:19,426
I have to see his face on TV
or the Internet, whether I want to or not!

279
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:21,887
After he…

280
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:24,806
did that to me…

281
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:29,728
he gets to smile and bask
in the limelight like it never happened!

282
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:34,608
How could I ever be okay with that?

283
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:37,110
But I…

284
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:49,206
The perpetrator gets protected
while the victim gets silenced.

285
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:51,291
That's not how it should be.

286
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:57,547
Aso doesn't deserve to get away
with putting you through all this.

287
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:02,511
Will you please…

288
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:05,931
try one more time to go public with this?

289
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:09,518
I know a reporter who can help.

290
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:12,604
Thank you for today.

291
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:15,691
Likewise. It was a pleasure.

292
00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:23,949
Are you free?

293
00:21:24,032 --> 00:21:24,866
Sorry?

294
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:29,538
We could get a drink at a bar nearby.

295
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:33,917
I appreciate the offer,
but I still have work to do.

296
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:35,544
Maybe some other time.

297
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,879
Ms. Hirata.

298
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:41,842
I hope you'll continue
to have a good relationship

299
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:44,386
with Aso and our agency.

300
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:46,555
So do I.

301
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:13,957
Ma'am, she's here.

302
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:16,460
Sorry to call you so suddenly.

303
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:18,879
-The informant is in here.
-Okay.

304
00:22:18,962 --> 00:22:21,798
Do you plan to publish it
in Weekly Buncho?

305
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:25,218
No, it wouldn't get past
the editor-in-chief at Buncho,

306
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:27,512
so I'm acting on my own for now.

307
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:31,391
I'll think about the next steps
after listening to the victim's account.

308
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:32,684
Understood.

309
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:33,810
This way.

310
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:39,191
Sorry for the wait.

311
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:44,071
Let me introduce you.
This is Ms. Hirata, a reporter.

312
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:49,659
Why?

313
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:53,455
It's her?

314
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:55,332
Yes.

315
00:22:57,584 --> 00:22:58,543
Riko.

316
00:23:01,963 --> 00:23:03,632
What-- Ms. Riko?

317
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,427
I have nothing to say to her.

318
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:10,430
Wait. Excuse me. Ms. Riko!

319
00:23:11,681 --> 00:23:13,767
Do you know her?

320
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:21,441
She's my younger sister.

321
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:26,613
Ms. Riko! Ms. Riko.

322
00:23:26,696 --> 00:23:28,323
What happened? Please talk to me.

323
00:23:28,406 --> 00:23:31,284
-I have nothing to say.
-Please!

324
00:23:31,368 --> 00:23:32,869
Leave me alone.

325
00:23:47,425 --> 00:23:48,510
Thank you.

326
00:23:55,142 --> 00:24:00,105
Riko was scouted by a talent agency
when she was in high school.

327
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:04,151
She went against our parents' wishes,

328
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:07,237
and moved to Tokyo
after dropping out of school.

329
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:12,993
But this industry
is a hard place to survive in.

330
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:16,830
We never heard her name
in any big announcements.

331
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:24,254
As our parents grew more worried,
she contacted us less and less.

332
00:24:26,923 --> 00:24:31,761
She didn't even show up
to our father's funeral.

333
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:36,516
I can't forgive her selfishness

334
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:41,438
nor the entertainment industry
that lured her in with sweet promises,

335
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:43,106
then discarded her.

336
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:46,526
I'm sorry.

337
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:48,528
I couldn't stop her.

338
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:51,198
I should go too.

339
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:54,910
-Wait, but--
-It's okay, Kagawa

340
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:55,952
But…

341
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:58,747
Even if they were estranged,

342
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:02,584
she only just found out
that her own sister was part of all this.

343
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:09,799
RISA HIRAYAMA

344
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:23,939
AFTER THE MASTER OF THE MANSION DIED

345
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:29,778
Hirata.

346
00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:35,075
Finish up Aso's interview
and send it to me.

347
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:36,618
Yes, sir.

348
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:40,705
The CEO of Kodama is nagging me,
saying she wants to see the draft.

349
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:41,790
Thanks.

350
00:26:00,183 --> 00:26:02,686
-Goodbye.
-See you tomorrow.

351
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:09,276
No word from Ms. Riko?

352
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:10,277
None.

353
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:14,447
Here she finally worked up the courage
to talk about it,

354
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:17,158
but we damaged her trust in us.

355
00:26:17,784 --> 00:26:19,327
It wasn't your fault.

356
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:22,539
Who could've guessed
that the reporter was her sister?

357
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:27,210
How about convincing her
to talk to a different reporter?

358
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:31,881
But I don't know if we should
push her anymore right now.

359
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:34,551
How will we counter
Kodama Productions then?

360
00:26:35,343 --> 00:26:38,638
Unless we weaken their influence
by exposing Aso's sexual assault,

361
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:40,348
they'll keep pressuring us.

362
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:43,727
Call me if there are any updates. Goodbye.

363
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:54,279
I found something.

364
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:55,905
What?

365
00:26:56,573 --> 00:26:58,491
Take a look at this.

366
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:01,911
DOCUMENTARY KODAMA PRODUCTIONS

367
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:04,372
What's this?

368
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:06,041
A Kodama Productions audition.

369
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:09,669
From when Yuri Hara joined.

370
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,797
Yuri Hara?

371
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:17,052
A talent I was in charge of
back at Kodama Pro.

372
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:19,471
Wait, but isn't she the one--

373
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:26,978
I thought I'd seen Ms. Riko before,
so I did some research.

374
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:35,695
Back there.

375
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:54,214
Good day.

376
00:28:03,556 --> 00:28:04,891
Mom? What is it?

377
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:06,434
Kanade?

378
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:10,271
I wanted to talk to you
about Dad's memorial service.

379
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:12,649
When will you come home next?

380
00:28:12,732 --> 00:28:15,819
Sorry, I can't say yet.
I'll let you know when I'm sure.

381
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:17,404
Oh, and also,

382
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:19,906
have you heard from Riko?

383
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:27,497
I tried calling her,
but it never goes through.

384
00:28:28,289 --> 00:28:29,916
Just forget her already.

385
00:28:29,999 --> 00:28:32,377
But I'm still worried about her.

386
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,672
I wonder where she is
and what she's doing.

387
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:39,634
Sorry, Mom.
I'm still at work. Call you later.

388
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:53,189
Hello?

389
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:01,823
Doesn't Hirata…

390
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:04,784
seem strange to you lately?

391
00:29:05,493 --> 00:29:06,327
What?

392
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:07,954
Doesn't she?

393
00:29:08,663 --> 00:29:10,582
Why would you ask me?

394
00:29:10,665 --> 00:29:12,625
Aren't you two dating?

395
00:29:12,709 --> 00:29:15,003
-What?
-Don't bother playing dumb.

396
00:29:15,628 --> 00:29:18,131
I used to be a reporter too. I can tell.

397
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:24,554
Did you tell her
about that thing with Aso?

398
00:29:26,389 --> 00:29:28,558
No, of course not.

399
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:40,779
This is the Aso interview article
that she wrote up.

400
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:46,367
She didn't go for anything too deep.

401
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:49,788
Looks to me like she's cautious.

402
00:29:51,998 --> 00:29:53,208
Be honest.

403
00:29:54,584 --> 00:29:56,711
How much has she found out?

404
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:01,508
I don't know.

405
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:03,259
I really don't.

406
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:20,026
-Sorry for calling you so late.
-It's fine.

407
00:30:21,027 --> 00:30:23,196
About what happened this afternoon…

408
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:24,823
Can I go first?

409
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:29,702
I'm considering backing out
of the Hideto Aso situation.

410
00:30:30,787 --> 00:30:33,790
I know I'm the one
who brought it up to you, so I apologize.

411
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:37,877
Is it because your sister is involved?

412
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:40,338
As a reporter,

413
00:30:40,421 --> 00:30:44,300
I judged that it would be difficult
to keep my personal feelings out of it.

414
00:30:46,594 --> 00:30:50,598
And besides,
I doubt that she would open up to me.

415
00:30:51,724 --> 00:30:53,810
We never exactly got along.

416
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:56,646
Neither of us wants to see each other.

417
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:58,857
Do you really…

418
00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:00,817
feel that way?

419
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:07,824
I have something I want you to see.

420
00:31:25,592 --> 00:31:26,509
What's this?

421
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:29,971
A video of an old audition
for Kodama Productions.

422
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:35,810
Keep going!

423
00:31:36,477 --> 00:31:37,604
The one in the back.

424
00:31:39,939 --> 00:31:40,899
That's Ms. Riko.

425
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:43,026
And two, and three, and four…

426
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:45,486
I asked the other participants too.

427
00:31:46,362 --> 00:31:50,491
While she didn't pass the audition,
she worked harder than anyone.

428
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:52,410
Two, three, four.

429
00:31:52,493 --> 00:31:54,829
Five, six, seven, eight.

430
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:58,291
One, two, three, four.

431
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:02,170
This industry is special.

432
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:07,300
Once you enter it, it's not easy
to return to a regular life.

433
00:32:09,135 --> 00:32:11,971
Some people get a lucky break,

434
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:15,433
while others find no success
despite putting in great effort.

435
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:24,275
Because you yourself are the product.

436
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:30,448
If things don't go well, you feel like
your own worth is being rejected.

437
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:35,703
You wish for validation, grow desperate,

438
00:32:36,579 --> 00:32:38,247
and find yourself trapped.

439
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,336
That's how this industry enchants people.

440
00:32:46,589 --> 00:32:49,842
I don't think Ms. Riko
neglected her family.

441
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:53,054
I think she kept
struggling the entire time.

442
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:59,143
So that one day, her family would accept
the path she chose.

443
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:06,067
What would you understand?

444
00:33:07,443 --> 00:33:08,611
What about you?

445
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:11,948
Can you really say
you understand Ms. Riko?

446
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:17,954
It's true that this industry
has a foul side to it,

447
00:33:18,955 --> 00:33:21,874
but most talents
put in everything they've got,

448
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:24,585
and the management tries to support them.

449
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:27,296
And yet, some never get accepted.

450
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:32,677
I'd say I understand
how lonely that can make them feel.

451
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:37,724
What is it that drives you?

452
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:38,766
Right.

453
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:43,396
I left my home against my parents' wish.

454
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:46,190
I know they must be worried,

455
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:49,277
so I want to put them at ease
by showing some results.

456
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:51,487
Thank you.

457
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:52,530
Thank you too.

458
00:33:52,613 --> 00:33:54,323
-That'll be all.
-Thank you.

459
00:34:05,334 --> 00:34:07,503
YOU HAVE AN UNREAD MESSAGE

460
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:12,467
RIKO, RIGHT?
THIS IS KANADE. CAN WE TALK?

461
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:20,683
Hey there.

462
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:22,685
-You alone?
-Let's drink together.

463
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:24,604
-Our treat.
-Just one, okay?

464
00:34:24,687 --> 00:34:26,230
Hey. Wait up!

465
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:29,484
RIKO, RIGHT?
THIS IS KANADE. CAN WE TALK?

466
00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:48,669
Welcome.

467
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:50,630
-Two coffees.
-Coming right up.

468
00:34:58,221 --> 00:34:59,347
Here it is.

469
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:02,809
The proposal
for the online drama that Mori got us.

470
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:05,645
It's not a major production,
but shall we take it?

471
00:35:08,314 --> 00:35:09,816
Let's give it a try.

472
00:35:10,399 --> 00:35:12,318
I hope it works out.

473
00:35:12,401 --> 00:35:15,905
We have to keep ourselves afloat,
even if it's through small jobs.

474
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:21,869
Ma'am?

475
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:31,295
In this industry, only few people succeed
even after passing strict auditions.

476
00:35:33,005 --> 00:35:36,676
Most of them
just exhaust themselves and fade away.

477
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:39,262
That's…

478
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:44,016
You know what Yuri's parents
said to me at her funeral?

479
00:35:45,351 --> 00:35:47,436
"You people are monsters."

480
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:52,275
Ms. Yuri's death wasn't your fault.

481
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,737
I should've been with her more.

482
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:59,991
I don't want to avoid responsibility.

483
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:10,835
I wonder what our job even is.

484
00:36:17,925 --> 00:36:19,802
-Vodka tonic.
-Hey!

485
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:21,596
Listen.

486
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:23,389
Don't ignore me.

487
00:36:23,931 --> 00:36:25,516
You're annoying. Go away.

488
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,475
What?

489
00:36:27,101 --> 00:36:28,519
-Watch it, you--
-Wait.

490
00:36:29,103 --> 00:36:31,230
-She's Risa Hirayama.
-Who?

491
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:33,941
She was a pin-up model,
for a little while.

492
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:38,070
Yikes. And now she's drinking booze alone
at a place like this?

493
00:36:38,154 --> 00:36:40,198
Oh, what a poor thing.

494
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:42,491
Hey, I have an idea.
How about you do porn?

495
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:44,202
You'll be way more successful.

496
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:46,162
-Good idea.
-Right?

497
00:36:46,954 --> 00:36:48,372
Hey, relax.

498
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:50,917
Hey! What's your problem?

499
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:53,669
-Calm down!
-Stop it!

500
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:55,171
-What the heck?
-Let go!

501
00:36:55,254 --> 00:36:56,589
Let me go!

502
00:36:57,465 --> 00:36:59,425
-Calm down!
-Let go!

503
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:21,948
RIKO, RIGHT?
THIS IS KANADE. CAN WE TALK?

504
00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:41,092
Hello?

505
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,282
I'm sorry for the trouble.

506
00:38:20,172 --> 00:38:21,257
Why did you come?

507
00:38:22,091 --> 00:38:24,093
You think I deserve it, don't you?

508
00:38:24,176 --> 00:38:25,344
I don't.

509
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:27,972
You think I'm pathetic and miserable.

510
00:38:28,055 --> 00:38:29,432
Look, I don't.

511
00:38:29,515 --> 00:38:31,809
You do. You always have.

512
00:38:31,892 --> 00:38:35,271
You've always looked down on me,
like you knew better.

513
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:42,069
You'd never understand how I feel.

514
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:47,908
Of course not!

515
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:53,122
I never did.

516
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:56,625
I didn't even try.

517
00:38:58,794 --> 00:39:02,048
I had no idea how you felt
as you continued struggling.

518
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:11,557
Even if you have the skill and work hard,
things don't always work out.

519
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:17,563
No matter how desperate you get,
reality is all too often cruel.

520
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:25,613
But you stayed true to yourself

521
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:32,203
and did the best you could
without accepting defeat.

522
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:35,956
Isn't that right?

523
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:41,837
That's why…

524
00:39:44,006 --> 00:39:44,965
I'm sorry.

525
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:50,888
For not being able to notice anything.

526
00:39:55,684 --> 00:39:58,896
It must have been so hard, all this time.

527
00:40:18,999 --> 00:40:20,418
You should come home.

528
00:40:21,961 --> 00:40:24,755
Mom is worried about you.

529
00:40:43,357 --> 00:40:46,610
I still have unfinished business.

530
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:49,697
Unfinished business?

531
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:53,200
I want to expose Aso.

532
00:40:57,246 --> 00:41:01,000
In the end, I can't forgive him.

533
00:41:05,421 --> 00:41:06,422
I want you…

534
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:09,967
to write the article.

535
00:41:14,388 --> 00:41:15,431
Please.

536
00:41:56,388 --> 00:41:58,057
You monster!

537
00:42:12,613 --> 00:42:14,907
HARA FAMILY

538
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:15,950
Hello?

539
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:28,379
They are waiting for you.

540
00:42:28,462 --> 00:42:29,380
Thanks.

541
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:35,261
Ms. Riko.

542
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:38,514
I'm sorry about last time.

543
00:42:38,597 --> 00:42:39,473
It's okay.

544
00:42:40,516 --> 00:42:42,685
The two of us talked things out.

545
00:42:43,602 --> 00:42:44,895
And we decided…

546
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:50,401
I will tell you everything
that happened to me.

547
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:50,753
Only one person knows
I'm investigating this story.

548
00:43:51,337 --> 00:43:52,504
PREVIEW

549
00:43:52,588 --> 00:43:55,257
I… I'll live my life my own way!

550
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:57,259
THE SECRET PAST IS REVEALED

551
00:43:57,343 --> 00:43:59,595
She likely won't agree to settle.

552
00:43:59,678 --> 00:44:02,056
You think Kodama Productions
is behind this?

553
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:04,058
CHANGING FACTS AS FAKE JUSTICE

554
00:44:04,141 --> 00:44:06,268
Do you really find that acceptable?

555
00:44:06,352 --> 00:44:08,395
I will never

556
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:11,649
be able to regain control of my life.

557
00:44:11,732 --> 00:44:15,069
You mean Ioka is also involved in this?

558
00:44:15,152 --> 00:44:17,279
Are you Riko Hirata?

559
00:44:17,363 --> 00:44:19,782
I won't let Kodama Pro do as they please.

560
00:44:19,865 --> 00:44:23,035
I can hear you out if you want.

561
00:44:24,787 --> 00:44:26,914
A SLIVER OF HOPE TURNS FATE AROUND

562
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:30,167
I'll try one more time
to make this into an article.

563
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:33,379
Ms. Yoko won't try to sabotage me again,
will she?

564
00:44:33,462 --> 00:44:34,380
You're still on that?

565
00:44:34,463 --> 00:44:36,006
What about my standing?

566
00:44:36,715 --> 00:44:37,800
Ma'am!

567
00:44:38,717 --> 00:44:40,052
But how…?

568
00:44:40,135 --> 00:44:42,888
THE TRUTH CHANGES INSTANTLY

569
00:44:43,472 --> 00:44:47,476
Let's put a stop to this absurd injustice.

570
00:44:47,559 --> 00:44:51,563
KANADE'S SISTER, RIKO HIRATA,
IS THE VICTIM OF THIS INCIDENT

571
00:44:51,647 --> 00:44:57,694
DARKNESS LOOMS OVER HER
AS A CRUEL TRAP PREYS ON HER EMOTIONS

572
00:44:59,488 --> 00:45:03,992
