1
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,107
Hey, can you keep it down?

2
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:31,448
I told you to keep it down.

3
00:00:32,782 --> 00:00:35,702
-Hey.
-Keep it down, okay?

4
00:00:36,661 --> 00:00:38,079
Your sister has homework.

5
00:00:43,042 --> 00:00:44,294
Making progress?

6
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:46,171
-Yeah.
-Mom.

7
00:00:46,254 --> 00:00:47,839
-It's written really well.
-Really?

8
00:00:47,922 --> 00:00:49,841
Yeah, it's very neat.

9
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:54,679
My parents always sided
with my elder sister.

10
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:58,224
I'm home.

11
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:06,816
They're not the biggest agency,

12
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,028
but many of their talents
are in dramas and magazines.

13
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:13,907
They said I could be on TV
if I worked hard and took lessons.

14
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:15,617
Are you being serious?

15
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:19,370
I am. I'm going to quit school
and move to Tokyo soon.

16
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:21,372
Don't be foolish.

17
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:23,625
It's not going to be that easy.

18
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:26,002
What do you mean, "foolish?"

19
00:01:27,128 --> 00:01:29,631
At least go to college first.

20
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:35,804
Riko.

21
00:01:36,554 --> 00:01:38,306
I'm not the same as you.

22
00:01:38,389 --> 00:01:41,976
I'll live my life my own way!

23
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:44,646
Hey, wait. Riko!

24
00:01:54,155 --> 00:01:57,742
I wanted to make my family accept me.

25
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:06,376
After defying my parents' wishes,
I found myself breathing the Tokyo air,

26
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:09,754
which was murky and full of exhaust fumes.

27
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:14,050
But to me, it was the smell of freedom.

28
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:16,678
A smell I didn't have back home.

29
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:20,140
Here we are.

30
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,559
Feel free to use the slippers.

31
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,604
This one was built 50 years ago.

32
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:31,276
And it's far from the station
with no automatic lock on the door,

33
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:34,362
so it's not the best place
for a woman to live alone.

34
00:02:34,445 --> 00:02:38,324
But considering your budget,
this is about what you can get.

35
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:44,455
Everything related to water usage
should be relatively new, though.

36
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:53,006
But if I recall, the water heater
for the bath is an older model.

37
00:02:58,636 --> 00:02:59,888
I'll take it.

38
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,140
MK PROMOTION

39
00:03:02,223 --> 00:03:03,766
This will be your stage name.

40
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:05,685
Risa Hirayama.

41
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:08,396
You'll have to pass
the trial period first, though.

42
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:10,690
Your lessons will cost 30,000 yen monthly.

43
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:16,446
Whether you get officially signed on
with us will depend on your performance.

44
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:21,075
Sorry, I was told my lesson fees
would be covered for me.

45
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:24,412
Oh, that's only
after you are officially signed on.

46
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:28,708
Is that okay?

47
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:31,502
Yes, I understand.

48
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:32,670
Good.

49
00:03:37,675 --> 00:03:40,887
I started part-time work
to cover my lesson fees.

50
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:43,932
Ms. Hirata, restock the drinks after that.

51
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:44,933
Okay.

52
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:48,394
I genuinely believed
what my manager told me.

53
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:50,355
Ready? Start.

54
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:53,858
Don't you get why Yuu feels so sad?

55
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:56,402
Stop. You don't have to fight over this.

56
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:57,362
This is important.

57
00:03:57,445 --> 00:04:00,490
How would I get it?
She just randomly started crying.

58
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:01,366
That's why you--

59
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:03,910
-Ms. Hirayama, put more emotion in it.
-Okay.

60
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:08,498
Unfortunately, we will not be
signing you on this time either.

61
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:10,833
I see.

62
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:13,044
But you're really close.

63
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:16,047
How about you keep
taking lessons a little longer?

64
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:20,134
Look, it's not just me.

65
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:23,429
Others in the agency agree
there's something special about you!

66
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,517
Let's keep trying.

67
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:32,063
Okay, I will.

68
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:36,109
Also, the lesson fees will go up
by 5,000 to 35,000 yen from this month.

69
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:38,695
-Sorry?
-Hope it's not an issue.

70
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:40,154
Please sign here.

71
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:43,032
Right here.

72
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:46,494
Okay.

73
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:53,167
Thinking back on it now,

74
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:58,006
I'm sure he must have said the same thing
to dozens or even hundreds of people.

75
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:02,635
Hey, can you man the register?

76
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:03,553
Coming.

77
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:06,723
And yet,
all I could do was trust his words.

78
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:08,016
Sorry for the wait.

79
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:11,769
-Stay away!
-Stop.

80
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:13,146
Don't do it!

81
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:14,731
This doesn't concern you two.

82
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:17,567
Do you have any idea how I feel?
How could you?

83
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:20,820
-Let's switch now.
-Okay.

84
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:30,747
Stay away. This doesn't concern you two.

85
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:31,664
RIKO HIRATA

86
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:41,716
Before I knew it, three years had gone by.

87
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:51,225
HAVE YOU SEEN THIS?

88
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:56,064
NEXT STAR AUDITION 2020

89
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:03,946
CEO, YOKO KODAMA
WE WANT TO UNCOVER YOUR UNIQUE TALENT

90
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:08,409
I decided to bet everything on it.

91
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:14,457
The Kodama Productions
Next Star Audition 2020.

92
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:18,711
The winner of this
tournament-style audition

93
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:22,340
will be officially signed on
with Kodama Productions,

94
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:27,136
and be awarded a lead role in a movie.

95
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:30,014
I thought of it as my last chance.

96
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:33,226
One, and two, and three, and four.

97
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:35,686
Five, six, seven, eight.

98
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,814
One, two, three, four.

99
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:39,732
Looking good, Ms. Hara!

100
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:42,485
Ms. Hirasawa, you're falling behind.

101
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:48,533
Four, five, six, seven, eight.
One, two, three, and four, and five.

102
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:51,369
-Hello there.
-Oh, hello.

103
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:54,080
Hi there.

104
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:57,333
Hello.

105
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:01,963
-Thank you. Good luck.
-Thank you.

106
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,048
Ms. Hirayama?

107
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:05,842
-Yes?
-I'd like a comment.

108
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:07,343
What is it that drives you?

109
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:08,803
Right.

110
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:13,558
I left my home against my parents' wishes.

111
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,352
I know they must be worried,

112
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:19,605
so I want to put them at ease
by showing some results.

113
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:31,659
"Say something."

114
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:34,120
"Do you know how precious it was to me?"

115
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:37,665
"It's a treasure from…"

116
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:40,710
"It's a treasure I received
from someone dear to me."

117
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:44,255
"It's a treasure I received
from someone dear to me."

118
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:50,595
"What's with that attitude?
Say something."

119
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:52,763
"Do you know how precious it was to me?"

120
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:55,391
-Cheers!
-Cheers.

121
00:07:55,475 --> 00:08:00,271
I wanted more time to practice,
so I started work as a hostess.

122
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:02,523
You're a heavy drinker, huh?

123
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:03,524
Go for one more?

124
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:05,443
-Sure.
-I'd love to.

125
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:08,696
We've kept you waiting long enough.

126
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:13,159
Now, we'll announce the winner
who passed the final review.

127
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:23,127
The winner of the Kodama Productions
Next Star Audition 2020 is…

128
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:31,427
Ms. Yuri Hara!

129
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:32,929
Congratulations!

130
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:38,267
Come to the center of the stage.

131
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:44,232
It was my last chance.

132
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:46,609
-Did you hear?
-What?

133
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:48,277
That the audition was rigged.

134
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:49,278
Seriously?

135
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:53,783
Apparently, the agency did it
to get publicity for their talent's debut.

136
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:56,577
I guess it's all about who you know, huh?

137
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:21,394
And it was then of all times…

138
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:23,020
LANTERN FOR THE DEPARTED

139
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:24,313
He was still so young.

140
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:27,733
I feel sorry for the wife.

141
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:22,079
Why didn't you come?

142
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:54,570
HEY, IT'S MARIKA

143
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:57,531
WANT TO GET DRINKS WITH
HIDETA ASO FROM KODAMA PRODUCTIONS?

144
00:10:57,615 --> 00:10:58,783
GOOD NETWORKING CHANCE!

145
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:04,830
Try it sometime.

146
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:07,875
-Can you keep going?
-Of course. We just got started.

147
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:11,295
You're good with your drinks, I see.

148
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:12,588
I like that.

149
00:11:12,671 --> 00:11:14,632
-So, where are you from?
-Kyoto.

150
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:16,008
Wait, me too!

151
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:17,593
-Really?
-Yeah, really.

152
00:11:17,676 --> 00:11:21,222
-Not just trying to hit on her?
-No, I'm being for real right now.

153
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:34,318
SORRY, SOMETHING CAME UP,
SO I CAN'T MAKE IT.

154
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:45,955
Enjoying yourself?

155
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:47,790
Mr. Aso.

156
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:49,417
Are you alone?

157
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:51,085
Care to join me?

158
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,337
Yes.

159
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:59,927
So you quit high school
and moved to Tokyo alone?

160
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:01,762
Yes.

161
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:06,475
My parents opposed it,
so I basically ran away from home.

162
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:10,813
But things haven't gone well since then.

163
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:18,946
I actually took an audition
for your agency recently.

164
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:20,281
For us?

165
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:21,282
Yes.

166
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:25,119
But I didn't make it past the final stage.

167
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:31,542
I decided to come here today
because I thought I could get to meet you,

168
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:34,879
and ask what you think I'm lacking.

169
00:12:37,047 --> 00:12:39,800
Maybe the judges just lacked taste.

170
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:44,597
You have a lot of charm, if you ask me.

171
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:50,144
I can hear you out if you want.

172
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:53,689
Will you really?

173
00:12:53,772 --> 00:12:57,109
Mr. Aso, we'll be leaving first then.

174
00:12:58,861 --> 00:12:59,987
Thank you.

175
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:01,280
Take care.

176
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:02,531
See you again.

177
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:08,245
How about another drink?

178
00:13:09,246 --> 00:13:10,122
What?

179
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:11,790
Or will you go home?

180
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:14,585
I'm fine either way.

181
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:18,506
How about it?

182
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:23,844
I'll stay. I want to talk more with you.

183
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:26,096
Come with me then.

184
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:57,962
Thank you.

185
00:13:58,045 --> 00:13:58,963
Cheers.

186
00:13:59,046 --> 00:13:59,922
Cheers.

187
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:11,559
Here.

188
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:13,018
Thank you.

189
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:40,713
Sorry, I think I drank too much.

190
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:51,515
Wait. Stop it!

191
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:53,267
That hurt.

192
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:57,479
I'm sorry. But that's not why I…

193
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:58,772
Just leave then.

194
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:03,903
If that's the extent of your resolve.

195
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:12,244
Just kidding.

196
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:16,123
I'm willing to help you out, you know.

197
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:19,168
I can connect you to the right people.

198
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:57,790
I'm leaving first, okay?

199
00:15:57,873 --> 00:15:59,333
Have a shoot to get to.

200
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,628
Here's your taxi fare.

201
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:04,380
Bye.

202
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:10,344
Goodbye.

203
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,687
"Goodbye"?

204
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:05,858
I'm fine.

205
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:10,821
I'm fine.

206
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:16,368
I'm fine.

207
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:21,665
I'm fine…

208
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,669
I'm fine.

209
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:34,094
Over and over, I tried to convince myself.

210
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:35,137
I'm fine.

211
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,222
I'm fine.

212
00:17:38,932 --> 00:17:42,394
If I didn't do so, I thought I might snap.

213
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:48,567
In the end, neither Aso nor
Kodama Productions ever contacted me.

214
00:17:49,943 --> 00:17:51,653
I had to face the reality.

215
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:56,617
I was…

216
00:17:57,951 --> 00:18:02,164
My dream was taken advantage of.

217
00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:06,877
I was just used by him…

218
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:11,131
as an outlet for his sexual desires.

219
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:16,303
That was five years ago.

220
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:21,308
Let's take a break.

221
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:24,019
Please let me continue.

222
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:26,522
-But--
-I want to tell you.

223
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:28,232
All of it.

224
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:32,694
Tell me if it gets too much.

225
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:38,617
Did you ask anyone for help?

226
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:44,706
I told my agency about it,
and they let me go the next day.

227
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:46,208
What?

228
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:48,085
My manager said,

229
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:52,840
"Don't drag us into this. We don't want
any issues with Kodama Productions."

230
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:54,216
As he yelled at me.

231
00:18:56,051 --> 00:19:00,305
"Sexual assault? You just tried
to seduce him and failed, didn't you?"

232
00:19:02,182 --> 00:19:04,768
I thought, "Oh, I see."

233
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:07,521
"I guess that wasn't sexual assault."

234
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:11,275
"It's just an excuse
that I couldn't fight back."

235
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:14,069
"It was my fault for going to the party

236
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:18,866
and trying to get close to him,
so I could get more work."

237
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:22,035
"It was all my fault."

238
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:23,287
"I deserved it."

239
00:19:24,454 --> 00:19:26,373
"So there was nothing to be done."

240
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:29,793
Did you try the police?

241
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:33,672
I couldn't.

242
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,633
I thought they wouldn't bother.

243
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:46,143
But as time went on,
I started to feel detached from it.

244
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:50,939
It started to feel less real,
almost like it was a bad dream.

245
00:19:52,816 --> 00:19:54,276
What was I fussing over?

246
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:56,778
I'm totally fine now.

247
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:02,951
I probably looked normal to others.

248
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:08,290
But for that entire period,

249
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:13,337
I wasn't even sure
whether I was alive or dead.

250
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:18,425
Everything felt so dull,
no matter what I did.

251
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:20,719
-That'll be 2,700 yen.
-Okay.

252
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:27,351
I tried to maintain
a sense of normalcy on the outside.

253
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:32,356
I would remember
that day less and less often.

254
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:34,983
To a secure future.

255
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:37,236
However…

256
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:43,700
I hadn't gotten over it even a little bit.

257
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:52,292
We want to protect your smile
and the smiles of those dear to you.

258
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:56,421
Japan Sanwa Insurance.

259
00:20:56,505 --> 00:21:03,553
Why did I, the victim, have to suffer,
while he, the assailant, gets to smile?

260
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:10,185
At that moment,
I felt immense rage for the first time.

261
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:13,814
I can't forgive him.

262
00:21:13,897 --> 00:21:15,232
I refuse to.

263
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:20,946
As long as he stays in the limelight,

264
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:25,117
until he is judged for his sins
and forced out of this industry,

265
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:31,665
I will never be able
to regain control of my life.

266
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:36,586
That's why you went to Buncho?

267
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:41,216
Weekly Buncho covered many scandals
in the entertainment industry,

268
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,468
so I thought they'd publish it.

269
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:48,265
Though I didn't know
you were a reporter for them.

270
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:53,937
But that article
was ultimately suppressed.

271
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:56,231
After that,

272
00:21:56,898 --> 00:22:01,111
someone from Kodama Productions
strongly urged me to settle.

273
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:09,077
But now, after meeting you
and hearing what you had to say,

274
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:16,084
I've decided I don't want this
to be settled with money.

275
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:20,797
I want him to atone.

276
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,467
I want him to apologize.

277
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:26,094
I want to expose all his wrongdoings!

278
00:22:30,265 --> 00:22:33,560
Is that strange of me?
After all this time?

279
00:22:36,104 --> 00:22:37,355
It's not.

280
00:22:39,983 --> 00:22:41,359
It's not strange at all.

281
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:49,701
Have you ever heard of dissociation?

282
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:52,996
Victims of sexual assault
distance themselves

283
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:58,293
from what happened to them in order
to protect themselves from the trauma.

284
00:22:59,836 --> 00:23:04,424
I think you did so as well.
To keep yourself sane all this time.

285
00:23:06,009 --> 00:23:10,055
And after spending a long time
coming to terms with the facts,

286
00:23:10,138 --> 00:23:14,434
you finally recognized the anger
that was inside you all along.

287
00:23:15,268 --> 00:23:18,313
But I'm the one who made the choice to go.

288
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:21,483
It was absolutely not your fault.

289
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:26,863
Aso abused his superior status
in the entertainment industry

290
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:29,825
and took advantage of your aspiration.

291
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:32,577
And you were alone
with him in a private room.

292
00:23:33,286 --> 00:23:35,163
It would've been tough to resist.

293
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,710
When he said, "Just leave then,"

294
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,047
I thought if I defied him,

295
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:48,051
I wouldn't be able
to stay in the industry anymore.

296
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:51,721
I couldn't go against him
when I thought of that.

297
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:57,644
What Aso did
was undeniably sexual assault.

298
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:01,857
There's no need for you to blame yourself.

299
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:06,361
No one's ever…

300
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:09,489
said that to me before.

301
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:17,038
I'll try one more time
to make this into an article.

302
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:21,710
The problem is,

303
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:27,966
even if we keep your identity hidden,
people will likely slander you anyway.

304
00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:32,679
Of course, we'll do our utmost
to ensure you can't be identified.

305
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:34,848
I understand.

306
00:24:34,931 --> 00:24:39,227
Also, I can't write an article based
on just the information you've provided.

307
00:24:40,228 --> 00:24:41,813
I need other sources.

308
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:45,066
Why? Do you think I'm lying too?

309
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,902
I trust you, Riko.

310
00:24:49,112 --> 00:24:53,950
But the public won't
just take your word for it.

311
00:24:55,493 --> 00:24:58,705
"Where's the proof?
Did she just fabricate it?"

312
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:01,917
They'll be sure to respond with scrutiny.

313
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:07,464
Not to mention, Kodama Productions
and Aso will most likely respond too.

314
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:13,345
So we have to get the accounts
of the other people at the party,

315
00:25:13,428 --> 00:25:15,805
and build our case
with supporting evidence.

316
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:19,517
It'll take some time.

317
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:25,023
So I need you to be patient
and keep all this a secret.

318
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:27,192
Okay.

319
00:25:34,532 --> 00:25:35,784
I'm grateful…

320
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:39,162
that you told me.

321
00:26:14,447 --> 00:26:16,032
I'll see her home.

322
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:20,620
Let me know when you pin down
the participants of that party

323
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:22,539
and need to get in touch with them.

324
00:26:22,622 --> 00:26:24,874
I'll help as much as I'm able.

325
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:26,418
I appreciate it.

326
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:27,836
Bye then.

327
00:26:39,472 --> 00:26:40,515
Ms. Saki!

328
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:43,935
Can you come with me?

329
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:44,894
Sure.

330
00:27:03,204 --> 00:27:04,122
Over here.

331
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:07,625
-Good work.
-Hello.

332
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:16,259
About that online drama, Mr. Fujiwara
is now officially a part of it!

333
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:18,678
Really?

334
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:20,055
That's great.

335
00:27:23,516 --> 00:27:26,519
Chief, you don't look very excited.

336
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:28,396
You can look a little happier.

337
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,440
Mori worked hard for this.

338
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:32,817
You're right.

339
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:34,319
Good job, Mori.

340
00:27:35,403 --> 00:27:36,404
Thank you.

341
00:27:37,697 --> 00:27:42,077
Ms. Yoko won't try to sabotage me again,
will she?

342
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:45,205
It'll be fine.

343
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:49,250
I won't let Kodama Pro do as they please.

344
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:54,339
Let's put a stop to this absurd injustice.

345
00:27:56,966 --> 00:28:00,345
It's just as Hashimoto,
the editor-in-chief, told us.

346
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:03,139
I hardly believed it at first.

347
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:10,688
You mean Ioka is also involved in this?

348
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:13,233
What shall we do?

349
00:28:13,983 --> 00:28:17,237
Given that she's in contact
with Ioka and the reporter from Buncho,

350
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,572
she likely won't agree to settle.

351
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:25,912
As long as Mr. Hashimoto is on our side,
Weekly Buncho won't publish their article.

352
00:28:25,995 --> 00:28:30,750
However, we should make
our move sooner rather than later.

353
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:45,223
Mr. Kondo?

354
00:28:46,349 --> 00:28:49,728
I need your help with something.

355
00:29:13,626 --> 00:29:14,753
Ninomiya.

356
00:29:18,047 --> 00:29:19,132
Can we talk?

357
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:30,977
I talked to the victim
in the Aso sexual assault story.

358
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:36,441
I plan to write an article on it.

359
00:29:36,524 --> 00:29:38,026
You're still on that?

360
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:40,570
You'll never get it published
in Weekly Buncho.

361
00:29:40,653 --> 00:29:43,156
That's why I need your help.

362
00:29:43,823 --> 00:29:47,076
Find a publisher that won't bow to
Kodama Productions.

363
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,621
You have more connections
in the industry than me.

364
00:29:49,704 --> 00:29:52,290
Don't be ridiculous.
What about my standing?

365
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:56,419
What about your standing as a journalist?

366
00:29:57,128 --> 00:30:02,133
The perpetrator's crimes are covered up,
while the victim is forced to stay quiet.

367
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:04,552
Do you really find that acceptable?

368
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:06,346
Why are you so invested in this?

369
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:13,144
If you're going to get this invested
in strangers, this job's not for you.

370
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:19,400
The victim is my little sister.

371
00:30:24,697 --> 00:30:28,243
I didn't know that
until I actually met her.

372
00:30:29,577 --> 00:30:32,497
You're saying that girl is…

373
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:42,298
You want to write the article
for your sister's sake?

374
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:43,925
Yes.

375
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:46,511
But that's not all.

376
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:53,309
When I learned that she was the victim,
I finally understood.

377
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:57,021
The people in news stories
aren't just strangers.

378
00:30:58,481 --> 00:31:01,693
People dear to us
could become victims at any time.

379
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:09,284
That's why we, as reporters,
have to uncover and publicize the facts.

380
00:31:12,328 --> 00:31:15,123
I should've realized that sooner, huh?

381
00:32:04,964 --> 00:32:06,507
What's this?

382
00:32:07,383 --> 00:32:08,301
Can you tell?

383
00:32:09,552 --> 00:32:11,095
It's a cloud!

384
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:14,265
I see that smile.

385
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:16,476
-Mirei.
-You're so cute.

386
00:32:19,228 --> 00:32:20,813
Don't get the wrong idea.

387
00:32:21,522 --> 00:32:22,649
I haven't forgiven you.

388
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:28,738
I just don't want to be known
as the woman who got cheated on

389
00:32:28,821 --> 00:32:31,324
and had her marriage collapse.

390
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:35,328
What is it?

391
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:37,705
You're so cute.

392
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:40,166
I'll get your food ready, okay?

393
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:14,826
Ms. Mori contacted me.

394
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:18,621
Said you got a role in an online drama.

395
00:33:20,581 --> 00:33:21,499
Yeah.

396
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:28,131
Work your ass off.

397
00:33:40,768 --> 00:33:41,769
Also, this.

398
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:45,231
It's still a prototype.

399
00:33:45,314 --> 00:33:49,360
But I'm thinking of starting a new brand
and selling anti-cheating underwear.

400
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:52,613
You'll model for it, okay?

401
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:58,494
You lost me there.

402
00:34:05,501 --> 00:34:07,170
What's wrong, sweetie?

403
00:34:07,253 --> 00:34:08,421
What?

404
00:34:08,504 --> 00:34:10,965
You hungry? Let's get some food.

405
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:30,151
Are you Riko Hirata?

406
00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:35,073
I'm Kondo, a freelance journalist.

407
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,661
You're trying to get
an article published, right?

408
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:44,540
About a big-name actor's sexual assault.

409
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:48,044
A bunch of people have been
making false accusations,

410
00:34:48,127 --> 00:34:50,296
trying to get publicity
or settlement money

411
00:34:50,379 --> 00:34:53,800
by taking advantage of
the recent MeToo Movement.

412
00:34:53,883 --> 00:34:57,553
I'm writing a special feature
on such cases, which brings me here.

413
00:34:58,387 --> 00:35:01,265
Are you accusing me of lying?

414
00:35:02,475 --> 00:35:08,523
There are people who saw you arguing
with a member of a major talent agency.

415
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:10,274
Over settlement money, they said.

416
00:35:11,025 --> 00:35:11,859
That's not--

417
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:15,488
You made a false accusation
and demanded settlement money, didn't you?

418
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:20,409
But they ignored your demands, so now
you're trying to get an article out.

419
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:21,911
Am I wrong?

420
00:35:21,994 --> 00:35:23,538
That's not true! I'm not--

421
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:25,581
You're short on cash, aren't you?

422
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:29,377
And you work as a hostess, right?

423
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:37,385
Don't record without my permission!

424
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:38,928
Come on now.

425
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:43,057
I'll include this in the article, okay?

426
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:10,084
Riko?

427
00:36:19,051 --> 00:36:22,889
A reporter visited me. Said I'm lying
for publicity and settlement money.

428
00:36:22,972 --> 00:36:23,806
What?

429
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:27,185
If he writes that in an article,
no one will believe me!

430
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:30,730
I only told you guys about it.
How did he know?

431
00:36:30,813 --> 00:36:31,814
Did you tell him?

432
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:34,192
Of course not. Calm down.

433
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:37,862
I promise I'll find out how this happened.

434
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:38,905
Okay?

435
00:36:50,124 --> 00:36:51,834
How's Ms. Riko?

436
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:54,503
I told her not to go outside for now.

437
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:56,505
She was pretty shaken last night.

438
00:36:57,924 --> 00:37:00,384
How do you think
they found out about this?

439
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:03,930
Only one person knows
I'm investigating this story.

440
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:11,354
What do you want?

441
00:37:12,021 --> 00:37:14,065
Did you tell anyone about my sister?

442
00:37:15,441 --> 00:37:16,484
What's that about?

443
00:37:17,151 --> 00:37:19,445
A reporter came to my sister's place.

444
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:21,405
Said he'd write an article,

445
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:24,784
claiming she's lying about
the assault to get publicity and money.

446
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:26,369
-It wasn't me.
-But--

447
00:37:26,452 --> 00:37:27,328
I swear.

448
00:37:28,996 --> 00:37:30,039
And also…

449
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:41,008
That article's already out.

450
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:41,968
What?

451
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:46,514
"A former talent, now a hostess,

452
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:50,142
falsely accused a famous actor
of sexual assault for settlement money."

453
00:37:51,477 --> 00:37:53,062
But how…?

454
00:38:02,738 --> 00:38:04,740
YASUO KONDO, FREELANCE JOURNALIST

455
00:38:16,085 --> 00:38:17,336
Ma'am!

456
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:21,007
IS RISA HIRAYAMA THE MENTIONED TALENT?

457
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:23,718
SERIOUSLY? IT'S RISA HIRAYAMA?

458
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:25,428
They got us.

459
00:38:25,511 --> 00:38:30,224
Even if Ms. Riko's article comes out now,
people won't take it at face value.

460
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:33,352
You think Kodama Productions
is behind this?

461
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:45,114
-Hello.
-Riko?

462
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:47,366
What?

463
00:38:48,075 --> 00:38:50,286
You didn't answer my calls. I was worried.

464
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:55,916
About that article,
I'm sorry I couldn't stop it.

465
00:38:57,251 --> 00:38:59,378
Are you at home? I'll come over.

466
00:39:00,129 --> 00:39:01,047
Don't.

467
00:39:01,797 --> 00:39:02,715
But…

468
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:05,176
Just don't.

469
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:06,594
I'm fine.

470
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:10,056
Get some rest, okay?

471
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:12,516
We'll think of a countermeasure.

472
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,018
Call me if anything happens.

473
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:15,436
Okay.

474
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:17,563
Riko?

475
00:39:33,412 --> 00:39:34,455
See you tomorrow.

476
00:39:35,956 --> 00:39:39,001
Hirata, finish the article
for the web edition by tomorrow.

477
00:39:39,085 --> 00:39:40,544
-Okay.
-Thanks.

478
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:43,089
Good night.

479
00:40:06,695 --> 00:40:07,655
Good morning.

480
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:09,865
Hello.

481
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:13,202
Morning.

482
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:18,874
Hello?

483
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:21,377
This is Ioka. Did you see it?

484
00:40:22,044 --> 00:40:22,878
What?

485
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:36,559
To Sengawa, please.

486
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:03,836
Ms. Riko's post
is getting heavy criticism.

487
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:07,423
You should go to her immediately.

488
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:09,550
Okay.

489
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:20,478
Five years ago,
I was sexually assaulted by Hideta Aso.

490
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:26,817
That night, I went to a drinking party
attended by people in the industry.

491
00:41:27,401 --> 00:41:34,074
In the end, I was left alone with Aso,
and he then assaulted me.

492
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:38,913
I've tried to speak out
about it several times,

493
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:41,332
but I was silenced every time.

494
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:45,878
I was even betrayed
by the people I trusted.

495
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:51,675
Everything written
in that article is a complete lie.

496
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:52,968
TRASH HUMAN BEING

497
00:41:53,052 --> 00:41:54,345
Please believe me.

498
00:41:54,428 --> 00:41:57,139
WHAT A VULGAR WOMAN
I'M DISGUSTED

499
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:02,686
Please hurry.

500
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:12,947
Thank you.

501
00:42:25,125 --> 00:42:26,001
Riko?

502
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:27,711
Riko?

503
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:29,880
Riko!

504
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:45,729
Riko!

505
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:47,064
Riko!

506
00:42:55,447 --> 00:42:56,407
Riko!

507
00:42:57,449 --> 00:42:58,534
Riko!

508
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:33,652
I'm curious what choice he'll make.
Aren't you?

509
00:43:34,236 --> 00:43:35,446
PREVIEW

510
00:43:35,529 --> 00:43:37,156
THE FINAL EPISODE

511
00:43:37,239 --> 00:43:39,617
I haven't changed a bit since then.

512
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:42,286
IOKA'S PAST WITH KODAMA BECOMES KNOWN

513
00:43:42,369 --> 00:43:46,624
Do you really think you can antagonize
Kodama Pro and still get by?

514
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:48,042
You monster!

515
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:49,668
Give my Yuri back!

516
00:43:49,752 --> 00:43:51,128
THE MYSTERIOUS GIRL YURI HARA

517
00:43:52,129 --> 00:43:53,464
We need to talk.

518
00:43:53,547 --> 00:43:56,175
SCATTERED MYSTERIES ARE ALL CONNECTED

519
00:43:56,258 --> 00:43:58,302
What have you been digging into?

520
00:43:58,385 --> 00:44:00,054
You wrote that article.

521
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:02,848
As if you haven't done
the same thing as well.

522
00:44:03,432 --> 00:44:05,059
Absolutely unbelievable.

523
00:44:05,142 --> 00:44:06,852
So it's finally time.

524
00:44:06,935 --> 00:44:08,479
I'm counting on you, okay?

525
00:44:08,562 --> 00:44:10,856
AND THEN, THE FINAL FACE-OFF

526
00:44:10,939 --> 00:44:12,691
What are you plotting now?

527
00:44:12,775 --> 00:44:16,403
You've made the wrong decision.
But I'll give you a chance.

528
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:19,031
They'll attack her again
with baseless speculations.

529
00:44:19,114 --> 00:44:20,366
I thought about dying.

530
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:22,534
Looks like it went well.

531
00:44:22,618 --> 00:44:23,827
TO COVER IT UP?

532
00:44:23,911 --> 00:44:25,788
You think that's acceptable?

533
00:44:25,871 --> 00:44:28,916
They lost their future
