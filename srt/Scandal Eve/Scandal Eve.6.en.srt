1
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:34,743
As of today, I will be taking over
as the new CEO of Kodama Productions,

2
00:00:35,243 --> 00:00:38,705
in place of my father,
who is now bedridden from illness.

3
00:00:38,788 --> 00:00:40,623
I am Yoko Kodama.

4
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:46,296
My father built this company
from the ground up

5
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:51,009
and made it into what it is today
with help from many talents and employees.

6
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:55,013
I plan to make
this company flourish even more,

7
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,392
and contribute to the innovation
of the industry as a whole.

8
00:01:00,643 --> 00:01:02,771
I look forward to your support.

9
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:17,118
Many of our talents joined
because of Mr. Shigeru's charisma.

10
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:19,788
Doesn't feel like
Ms. Yoko can live up to him.

11
00:01:20,997 --> 00:01:22,707
You think we'll lose cohesion?

12
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:29,214
I just hope the talents
won't start leaving us.

13
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:35,970
I will create a new
Kodama Productions with my own strength.

14
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:42,185
The winner of the Kodama Productions
Next Star Audition 2020 is…

15
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:46,064
Ms. Yuri Hara!

16
00:01:46,147 --> 00:01:47,148
Congratulations!

17
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:52,529
Come to the center of the stage.

18
00:01:56,616 --> 00:02:01,079
To achieve that, I will create a new star.

19
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:06,084
Yuri.

20
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:11,798
I've landed a lead role for you
in JBS's Wednesday 9:00 p.m. drama slot.

21
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:15,009
-What?
-Filming starts next month.

22
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:19,806
The actor they'd hired had to drop out,
so they offered you the role instead!

23
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:21,850
But I'm still--

24
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:25,186
You'll be fine!
This is a very rare opportunity.

25
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:29,232
It's a premium time slot!
And for a series, no less.

26
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:31,025
You'll be famous overnight!

27
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:34,571
Okay.

28
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,781
Do your best, okay?

29
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:37,949
I will.

30
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:40,910
Isn't it too soon for Yuri?

31
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:42,912
The filming starts so soon.

32
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:45,456
JBS practically begged me to.

33
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:50,503
The conditions aren't ideal, but I secured
a main role for their April series too.

34
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:54,424
But if the ratings don't turn out well,
she'll get bashed for certain.

35
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:57,635
It's too much for her to handle.
She needs more experience--

36
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:01,014
We'll pass up opportunities
if we take our time.

37
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:05,894
Now is the time for Yuri
to get her name out.

38
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:08,521
Don't you even get that?

39
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:10,690
But she's--

40
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:14,444
You're no longer in charge of Yuri.

41
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:29,208
NEW QUEEN OF LOW RATINGS
YURI HARA

42
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:31,711
DISASTROUS PERFORMANCE BY LEAD ACTRESS

43
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:38,551
How's Yuri doing?

44
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:44,766
She managed to finish filming,
but she seems pretty shaken up.

45
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:47,977
She might need a break.

46
00:03:49,103 --> 00:03:50,605
What are you saying?

47
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:54,025
Her next shoot is coming up soon.
What about that?

48
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,030
Excuse me.

49
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:02,408
Hello?

50
00:04:05,536 --> 00:04:06,496
What?

51
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:12,377
Yuri…

52
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:17,382
Yuri…

53
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:24,222
Yuri…

54
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:29,936
You monster!

55
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:32,981
You people killed Yuri.

56
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:37,443
Give me my Yuri back.

57
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:39,404
Give her back.

58
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:42,073
Give my Yuri back!

59
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:03,344
Yuri's parents
are threatening to sue the agency.

60
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:10,268
They're saying she killed herself
due to the agency's overzealous approach.

61
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:12,353
How should we respond?

62
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,861
Call Kondo, the journalist.

63
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:29,454
A SAD FATHER-DAUGHTER STORY
ACTRESS YURI HARA

64
00:05:29,537 --> 00:05:32,623
THE REASON FOR SUICIDE
WAS A FINANCIAL DISPUTE WITH HER FATHER

65
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:34,542
YASUO KONDO, FREELANCE JOURNALIST

66
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:37,378
It was a shame what happened to Yuri.

67
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:44,802
But there's nothing we can do
about someone's personal troubles.

68
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,556
Is that really so?

69
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:56,397
I think we share part of the blame
for what happened to Yuri.

70
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:58,983
Are you saying it was my fault?

71
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:04,322
You can't nurture actors by giving them
lead roles that they haven't earned.

72
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:10,119
I will nurture actors
with a different method.

73
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:16,000
Are you saying you plan to go independent…

74
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:17,919
and leave us?

75
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:26,219
Do you really think you can antagonize
Kodama Pro and still get by?

76
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:31,641
Thank you for all you've done for me.

77
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:43,820
-Kuryu's leaving us?
-Yes.

78
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:47,031
He says he won't renew his contract.

79
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:48,241
Don't tell me…

80
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:50,910
Yes.

81
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:53,538
He's signing with Ioka's agency.

82
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:02,255
Tell the program directors of all
TV stations to deny Kuryu any roles

83
00:07:02,338 --> 00:07:05,258
and that we'll withdraw
our talents if they don't comply.

84
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:08,886
Yes, ma'am.

85
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,561
JOINT COMPANY INFO SESSION

86
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:24,110
Ma'am, do you have a moment?

87
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:26,654
Sorry.

88
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:31,492
-It's about JBS TV's special drama.
-Yes?

89
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:36,164
The actor starring alongside Mr. Aso
is going to be Kuryu Fujiwara.

90
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:38,708
How is that possible?

91
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,794
JBS wouldn't dare do that.

92
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:43,671
Well…

93
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:47,175
apparently, the chairman allowed it.

94
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:51,846
What is the meaning of this?

95
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:53,931
Meaning of what?

96
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:58,019
Why did you allow Kuryu to get the role?

97
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:05,485
Why do you side with Ioka to this extent?

98
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,823
Do you hate me that much?

99
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:13,868
Don't flaunt your own pettiness!

100
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:32,929
A US-Japan joint production.

101
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:37,433
We'll make the announcement
after the JBS special drama conference.

102
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,101
So it's finally time.

103
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:42,730
Let's make sure
your American debut goes well.

104
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:44,815
Which is why…

105
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:48,277
What is it?

106
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:57,370
I'm counting on you, okay?

107
00:08:58,037 --> 00:08:59,163
Of course.

108
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,958
I'm very grateful to you.

109
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:03,960
I'll repay the favor.

110
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,431
Sexually assaulted by Aso?

111
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:20,977
The other party came to us.

112
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:27,191
It was your leadership that made
Mr. Aso into the face of your agency,

113
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:31,320
which is precisely why
if people found out about this,

114
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,864
you would be forced
to take responsibility.

115
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:40,746
I expect the public
will react quite strongly,

116
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:44,667
especially considering the subject matter.

117
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:56,178
For next year,

118
00:09:56,262 --> 00:10:01,642
we'll give Buncho exclusive rights to sell
calendars featuring our idol talents.

119
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:05,313
On top of that…

120
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:10,901
I'm sure you need
another scoop in exchange.

121
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:21,454
An alleged affair
by celebrity actor Kuryu Fujiwara.

122
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,290
Should get plenty of attention, no?

123
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:30,421
KURYU FUJIWARA DRANK
AND CHEATED WITH AN UNDERAGE GIRL

124
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:41,265
This is fine.

125
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:50,232
Everything's proceeding smoothly.

126
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:54,820
Or so I had thought.

127
00:10:55,738 --> 00:11:00,910
WILL

128
00:12:28,622 --> 00:12:29,790
Mom.

129
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:32,877
Riko.

130
00:12:33,752 --> 00:12:35,087
She's asleep.

131
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:37,965
They said she would survive.

132
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:40,968
Thank goodness.

133
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:44,388
How did this happen?

134
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:48,434
What happened?

135
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:51,437
Pardon me.

136
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,192
Ms. Hirata?

137
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,030
Oh dear.

138
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,575
Excuse me. Are you an acquaintance?

139
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:05,618
Not quite.

140
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:09,121
Here's who I am.

141
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:14,210
I'm Kondo, a freelance journalist.

142
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:18,631
I was gathering information
from your daughter about a certain case.

143
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:21,175
What a close call, though.

144
00:13:21,258 --> 00:13:23,427
She almost got away.

145
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:25,429
They do say dead men tell no tales.

146
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,183
What do you mean?

147
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:30,226
Wait.

148
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:32,269
You don't know?

149
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:34,188
-It's pretty big news--
-Wait.

150
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:36,607
Let's talk outside.

151
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:49,620
What are you up to?

152
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:51,497
Even coming all the way here.

153
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:55,209
What am I up to?
Just gathering information.

154
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:59,421
You wrote that article, didn't you?

155
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:03,467
The one saying Riko made up
the assault for money and publicity.

156
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:04,510
Yes.

157
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:08,138
And I plan to write
a follow-up to that one soon.

158
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:11,642
About how the hostess
who claimed sexual assault had a relative,

159
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:13,686
who happens to work for Weekly Buncho.

160
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:18,190
What if Weekly Buncho made her lie
to get a big story out of it?

161
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:20,109
Now that's a scoop.

162
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,444
Can I get…

163
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:25,197
a comment on that?

164
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:30,077
What are you even thinking?

165
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:34,373
My sister almost died.

166
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,293
All because of your made-up article.

167
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:41,046
What gives you the right?

168
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:44,800
As if you haven't done
the same thing as well.

169
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:53,100
Whether it's made-up or not,
it just has to get the public's attention.

170
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:55,978
Isn't that what our job's all about?

171
00:14:58,105 --> 00:15:00,691
Anyway, I'll scram for today.

172
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:03,402
I'll come again.

173
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:23,881
I see. He visited you at the hospital?

174
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:27,343
He's the freelance journalist
who wrote the article on Riko.

175
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:28,886
You should watch out too.

176
00:15:28,969 --> 00:15:30,471
Thanks for informing me.

177
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:33,390
Please stay with Ms. Riko for now.

178
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:34,725
Bye.

179
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:39,104
Ma'am.

180
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:40,773
How's Ms. Riko?

181
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:43,192
Her life's not in danger.

182
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:46,779
That's good.

183
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:51,367
But we're back to square one
regarding the sexual assault.

184
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:54,370
We can't expect
Ms. Riko's cooperation as she is now.

185
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:58,707
The criticism against Ms. Riko
seems to have dialed down for now.

186
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:01,835
They're just bored
by the lack of new info.

187
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:05,172
If we pursue Aso for the sexual assault,

188
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:07,925
they'll attack her again
with baseless speculations.

189
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:10,427
Just like with Yuri.

190
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:13,555
Ms. Saki.

191
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:16,225
I'm sorry.

192
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:20,270
It's about Mr. Fujiwara's online drama.

193
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:23,065
He's been let go.

194
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,822
One of his co-stars
was with Kodama Productions,

195
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:31,365
and they raised a complaint.

196
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:32,658
That's just…

197
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:33,993
I'm sorry.

198
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:39,039
I tried to negotiate with them
to let him stay on, but it didn't work.

199
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,835
I'm so sorry. It's all my fault.

200
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:44,461
It's not.

201
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:47,506
I should have supported you properly.

202
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:51,677
You did more than enough
to get things going.

203
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:53,595
I'm sorry.

204
00:16:58,058 --> 00:16:59,018
Do we let Fujiwara…

205
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:04,857
I'll tell him myself.

206
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,449
Sorry to call you here all of a sudden.

207
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:14,658
It's fine.

208
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:17,494
It's a shame about that online drama.

209
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:20,122
-Your comeback was so close.
-What?

210
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:23,542
You haven't heard?

211
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:30,966
You've made the wrong decision.

212
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:34,553
But I'll give you a chance.

213
00:17:47,357 --> 00:17:49,026
It's not too late for you.

214
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:54,823
I can guarantee you a comeback
and turn you into a star.

215
00:17:57,701 --> 00:18:02,581
I wonder if Ioka
could manage the same thing.

216
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:11,507
EXCLUSIVITY CONTRACT

217
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:33,987
THE WRITER OF RIKO'S ARTICLE
CAME TO THE HOSPITAL.

218
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:37,449
HE MIGHT BE CONNECTED
TO KODAMA PRODUCTIONS.

219
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:40,869
FREELANCE JOURNALIST, YASUO KONDO

220
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:46,166
ACTRESS YURI HARA
SUICIDE

221
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,168
YASUO KONDO, FREELANCE JOURNALIST

222
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:18,615
Excuse me, you can't just--

223
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:19,908
Ioka.

224
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:21,869
What is this? How rude of you--

225
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:24,580
It was you. First Yuri and now this.

226
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:26,331
What are you on about?

227
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:29,960
Riko Hirata tried to commit suicide.
Thankfully, she managed to survive.

228
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:33,297
Who? I'm afraid
I've never heard that name.

229
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:37,926
Ms. Riko tried to go public
about being assaulted by Aso.

230
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:41,638
But then an article defaming her came out.
That was your doing, wasn't it?

231
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:43,432
Do you have any proof of that?

232
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:45,767
Yasuo Kondo.

233
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:47,728
I could never forget.

234
00:19:48,645 --> 00:19:51,440
That's the reporter who wrote
an article about Yuri Hara,

235
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:53,901
after her suicide four year ago.

236
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:57,154
He made it seem like her suicide

237
00:19:57,237 --> 00:19:59,698
was caused by financial disputes
with her father.

238
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,535
You orchestrated that too, didn't you?

239
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:07,873
If people knew that work-related issues
might have caused her suicide,

240
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:12,169
it would be seen as a management failure
and damage the agency's reputation!

241
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:15,339
Are you done yet?

242
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:20,761
I don't have time
for your speculative nonsense.

243
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:24,431
Do you not feel anything?

244
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:27,851
Do you value
your agency's reputation that much?

245
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:29,770
You'd sacrifice lives for it?

246
00:20:29,853 --> 00:20:31,647
You think that's acceptable?

247
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,607
You're the one sacrificing lives!

248
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:34,483
What?

249
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:37,236
What did you ever do
for Yuri Hara and Kuryu Fujiwara?

250
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:41,531
You failed to provide a suitable stage
for them or to protect them from harm!

251
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:43,033
On the contrary,

252
00:20:43,116 --> 00:20:46,328
they both lost their future
because they were involved with you.

253
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:50,707
And you dare speak to me of management?

254
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:57,798
Kuryu learned his lesson the hard way.

255
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:01,843
I talked to him just now.

256
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:03,762
With Kuryu?

257
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:06,348
If he returns to us,

258
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:09,810
I promised to get him lead roles
in at least two TV dramas per year,

259
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:11,520
as well as four ad contracts.

260
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:16,400
And earnings upwards of 200 million yen
in the first year alone.

261
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:18,986
You sold him out to a weekly magazine!

262
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:21,405
-And now you--
-The choice lies with Kuryu.

263
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:27,536
I'm curious what choice he'll make.

264
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:30,122
Aren't you?

265
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:44,803
EXCLUSIVITY CONTRACT

266
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:27,637
Please leave a message after the beep.

267
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:32,601
Hey, Kuryu?

268
00:22:33,351 --> 00:22:34,853
I need to talk to you.

269
00:22:35,812 --> 00:22:37,272
Can you call me back?

270
00:23:09,012 --> 00:23:10,222
Ninomiya?

271
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:35,372
Her condition is stable for now.

272
00:23:35,455 --> 00:23:36,706
She's fine.

273
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:38,458
I see.

274
00:23:57,102 --> 00:24:00,647
Besides your sister,
Aso assaulted others too.

275
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:10,657
I went and talked to a couple of them.

276
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:13,535
What?

277
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:19,958
They saw your sister's post
and found the courage to speak out too.

278
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:25,839
If multiple people give their testimony,

279
00:24:25,922 --> 00:24:28,300
his agency can't just
dismiss it all as lies.

280
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:31,761
But why?

281
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:36,266
If I hadn't given up on the article…

282
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:40,353
this wouldn't have happened to her.

283
00:24:44,107 --> 00:24:46,193
I'm really sorry.

284
00:24:56,703 --> 00:24:57,662
Kanade…

285
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,749
you should write the article.

286
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:05,337
Make sure your sister's actions
weren't in vain.

287
00:25:15,138 --> 00:25:16,681
I'll get in touch later.

288
00:26:09,442 --> 00:26:10,402
Riko!

289
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:22,205
They're all talking about me.

290
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:28,670
But none of them
are listening to what I said.

291
00:26:31,172 --> 00:26:34,676
The truth won't get through to anyone!

292
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:43,727
I wonder what will happen if I die.

293
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:47,605
Will they believe me then?

294
00:26:52,527 --> 00:26:55,655
Or will they just insult me more?

295
00:26:58,450 --> 00:26:59,409
Riko!

296
00:27:03,246 --> 00:27:04,539
Trust in me.

297
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:09,377
I'll make sure…

298
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:12,505
the truth gets out.

299
00:27:39,574 --> 00:27:40,533
Ms. Saki.

300
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:44,871
Thanks for coming.

301
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:48,875
-I'll have what she had.
-Yes, sir.

302
00:27:57,717 --> 00:27:58,968
The online drama…

303
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,930
didn't work out.

304
00:28:06,643 --> 00:28:07,894
Is that so?

305
00:28:10,271 --> 00:28:11,272
I'm sorry.

306
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:18,321
I just…

307
00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:23,118
couldn't accept the old ways
where the agency's influence

308
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:25,161
determined everything.

309
00:28:26,621 --> 00:28:29,040
That's why I created Rafale.

310
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:32,669
To try to change the industry,
at least a little.

311
00:28:35,296 --> 00:28:41,052
But really, what I couldn't accept
most of all was myself.

312
00:28:44,597 --> 00:28:46,349
I couldn't protect Yuri.

313
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:55,150
In the end,
I haven't changed a bit since then.

314
00:28:58,778 --> 00:29:00,572
I ruined your future, too.

315
00:29:04,659 --> 00:29:05,744
I'm sorry.

316
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:11,374
Here you go, sir.

317
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:20,967
You met Ms. Yoko, right?

318
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:24,512
Yes.

319
00:29:26,222 --> 00:29:28,057
I heard about the offer she made.

320
00:29:30,727 --> 00:29:36,149
Whatever you decide,
I promise to respect your wishes.

321
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:46,242
I thought about dying.

322
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:51,915
After that scandal…

323
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:57,212
I lost my family, my work, everything.

324
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:58,880
MET AT A BAR
AND SPENT THE NIGHT AT A HOTEL

325
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:02,592
On TV, they were
spreading rumors about me.

326
00:30:02,675 --> 00:30:07,514
And on social media,
people were telling me to go die.

327
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:13,520
I was genuinely about to lose it.

328
00:30:15,688 --> 00:30:19,734
Even death seemed better
than going through all of that.

329
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:21,986
It really did.

330
00:30:25,573 --> 00:30:26,533
But…

331
00:30:28,576 --> 00:30:29,744
In that moment…

332
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:34,374
you visited me, Ms. Saki.

333
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:38,044
It's because you stayed by my side…

334
00:30:40,129 --> 00:30:42,257
that I was able to pull through.

335
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:46,386
You're the reason I'm still alive.

336
00:30:47,637 --> 00:30:51,307
I'm only here now
because you were there for me.

337
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:56,604
That's why I have
no intention of leaving Rafale.

338
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:57,605
No matter what.

339
00:30:58,940 --> 00:30:59,774
Kuryu.

340
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:04,654
If we give up now, nothing will change.

341
00:31:04,737 --> 00:31:06,406
Think of the industry.

342
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:16,082
Also, I showed the contract
from Kodama Productions to Mirei too.

343
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:17,876
And guess what?

344
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,381
Can you believe this?

345
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:25,258
What are these terms?

346
00:31:25,341 --> 00:31:27,135
The agency takes a 70% cut?

347
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:30,096
Absolutely unbelievable.

348
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:33,474
They're mocking you.

349
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:34,976
She was pissed.

350
00:31:35,768 --> 00:31:36,603
What?

351
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:39,022
That their cut was too high.

352
00:31:39,939 --> 00:31:42,525
Even Rafale would be
better than this, she said.

353
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:44,944
Wait, "even" Rafale?

354
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:47,780
Well, yeah.

355
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:57,790
I'll keep following your lead, Ms. Saki.

356
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:04,923
Thank you.

357
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:20,939
Tomorrow at 10 a.m.,

358
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:24,359
I'll meet another talent
who was assaulted by Aso.

359
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:26,319
She's willing to testify?

360
00:32:26,402 --> 00:32:27,236
Yes.

361
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:30,323
She hadn't even told
her own agency about it yet,

362
00:32:30,406 --> 00:32:32,659
but Riko's post gave her the motivation.

363
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:38,539
But she might face intimidation
from her agency or Kodama Productions

364
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:40,458
if she comes forward with her story.

365
00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:44,629
She wants to continue
her activities in the industry.

366
00:32:45,254 --> 00:32:46,798
Could you help her out?

367
00:32:47,548 --> 00:32:50,093
Of course. I'll help in any way I can.

368
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:55,014
We can't let this injustice continue.

369
00:32:55,932 --> 00:33:02,105
Being forced into ignoring
unacceptable behavior is just outrageous.

370
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:17,328
Good evening, sir.

371
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:26,462
What have you been digging into?

372
00:33:30,383 --> 00:33:32,593
Did you think I hadn't noticed?

373
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:56,492
I couldn't bring myself to tell anyone.

374
00:33:58,244 --> 00:34:00,246
I'm scared to do it even now.

375
00:34:02,331 --> 00:34:08,671
But when I saw Riko Hirata's post online,
I knew I couldn't just stay quiet.

376
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:12,925
We promise to keep
our sources confidential.

377
00:34:14,635 --> 00:34:17,096
Thank you for being brave.

378
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:19,474
We'll make sure your courage isn't wasted.

379
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:38,367
I'll be talking
to another person tomorrow.

380
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:42,872
With this many testimonies,
they can't talk their way out of it.

381
00:34:42,955 --> 00:34:45,833
Only thing left is how to make it public.

382
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:49,504
Weekly Buncho would be
the best option, considering its reach.

383
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:54,342
I doubt the editor-in-chief will allow it.
It's more likely that he'll cover it up.

384
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:58,221
Should we go with a different medium?

385
00:35:03,142 --> 00:35:04,143
Hello there.

386
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:06,479
Sir?

387
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:09,565
Why are you here?

388
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:11,734
You were making some strange moves.

389
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:13,486
I just kept watch.

390
00:35:15,571 --> 00:35:16,948
Sorry for barging in.

391
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:19,784
Please take my card.

392
00:35:28,709 --> 00:35:32,171
You seriously plan to publish
an article on Aso's sexual assaults?

393
00:35:34,757 --> 00:35:36,425
It won't just be Buncho.

394
00:35:37,176 --> 00:35:39,762
You'll be blacklisted
by basically all publishers.

395
00:35:40,888 --> 00:35:41,889
I'll live with that.

396
00:35:43,015 --> 00:35:46,435
You want to help your sister
at the cost of your career?

397
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:49,564
How touching.

398
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:51,149
That's not it.

399
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:52,859
Her being family is irrelevant.

400
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:57,530
As a reporter,
I feel like this is the right call.

401
00:36:06,706 --> 00:36:07,748
In that case…

402
00:36:09,041 --> 00:36:10,376
put it in Weekly Buncho.

403
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:13,004
What?

404
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:16,924
What a fancy office, by the way.

405
00:36:20,386 --> 00:36:22,763
You'll write it no matter what, right?

406
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:24,807
Then write it for Weekly Buncho.

407
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:29,145
But why?

408
00:36:29,228 --> 00:36:31,230
You suppressed the article before.

409
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,818
What are you plotting now?

410
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:38,571
When Ninomiya first came to me,

411
00:36:39,155 --> 00:36:42,658
I thought it was a tough sell
with only one person's account.

412
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:48,748
However, the story's different
if you have several people's testimonies.

413
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:52,585
A big scoop like this
has to go to Weekly Buncho.

414
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:58,299
I plan to mention the connection between
Weekly Buncho and Kodama Productions.

415
00:36:58,382 --> 00:37:00,343
And your collusion with Yoko Kodama.

416
00:37:00,426 --> 00:37:01,844
Go right ahead!

417
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:03,763
It could ruin your career.

418
00:37:03,846 --> 00:37:06,349
You might even be dismissed from your job.

419
00:37:07,141 --> 00:37:09,185
I would expect nothing less.

420
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:13,522
It's been long enough.

421
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:18,778
I applied to the early retirement program.

422
00:37:18,861 --> 00:37:21,072
I'll get a hefty severance payment too.

423
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:27,036
Organizations are best used
to your benefit, you know?

424
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:31,415
I'll be waiting for your draft.

425
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:41,092
You've got a nice agency.

426
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:03,990
Excuse me.

427
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:06,784
Weekly Buncho sent us this.

428
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:10,496
REQUEST FOR VERIFICATION

429
00:38:10,579 --> 00:38:12,415
HIDETO ASO'S SEXUAL ASSAULT ALLEGATIONS

430
00:38:20,923 --> 00:38:21,757
Yes?

431
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:24,927
I just received a questionnaire
from Weekly Buncho.

432
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:26,512
This must be a mistake.

433
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:28,848
It's not a mistake.

434
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:30,766
What do you mean?

435
00:38:31,892 --> 00:38:34,186
Well, the tides have turned.

436
00:38:34,895 --> 00:38:35,813
Of the times?

437
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:38,816
You betrayed me?

438
00:38:38,899 --> 00:38:40,026
Betrayed?

439
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:43,154
Sounds like what
a weekly magazine would do.

440
00:38:43,237 --> 00:38:46,532
A friend in need
makes for a good scoop indeed.

441
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:52,747
I expect you understand what will become
of your standing after doing this?

442
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:55,541
Sure.

443
00:38:57,251 --> 00:39:00,046
I gave up on becoming
the managing director.

444
00:39:00,129 --> 00:39:04,175
I'm not really the type
to lead an entire organization.

445
00:39:05,926 --> 00:39:06,969
Goodbye then.

446
00:39:16,395 --> 00:39:18,647
Tell all the news stations
not to cover this.

447
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:20,858
And stop the article from coming out!

448
00:39:20,941 --> 00:39:23,569
-But--
-Just do it, whatever it takes!

449
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:35,998
This is the final draft.

450
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:38,501
HIDETO ASO'S SEXUAL ASSAULT
LINK BETWEEN KODAMA PRO & BUNCHO?

451
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:42,338
Kodama Productions did not respond.

452
00:39:43,255 --> 00:39:45,466
We'll send it to the press then.

453
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:48,177
We can finally put an end to everything.

454
00:39:52,264 --> 00:39:53,516
Thank you.

455
00:39:56,143 --> 00:39:57,144
Ma'am.

456
00:40:00,147 --> 00:40:01,148
Excuse me.

457
00:40:03,275 --> 00:40:04,527
A visitor for you.

458
00:40:07,029 --> 00:40:08,155
Akashi?

459
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:14,412
We need to talk.

460
00:42:00,726 --> 00:42:07,733
WEEKLY BUNCHO
NOVEMBER 6 ISSUE

461
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:16,033
Excuse me.

462
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:34,885
UNIVERSITY PRESIDENT
ALLEGEDLY FAKED CREDENTIALS

463
00:42:39,598 --> 00:42:41,600
Looks like it went well.

464
00:43:28,147 --> 00:43:31,692
I would like to thank
all of you for coming here today.

465
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:35,904
Just as we informed
the media outlets in advance,

466
00:43:35,988 --> 00:43:39,992
I called you here to discuss
the details of an article

467
00:43:40,075 --> 00:43:43,370
which was to be published
in today's issue of Weekly Buncho,

468
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:47,082
and contained allegations
of sexual assault by Actor A.

469
00:43:51,337 --> 00:43:52,504
What is this?

470
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:54,423
Didn't you stop the article?

471
00:43:56,425 --> 00:43:58,302
I saw the questionnaire you sent.

472
00:43:58,927 --> 00:44:00,429
And you came to stop us?

473
00:44:01,221 --> 00:44:02,097
It's pointless.

474
00:44:02,181 --> 00:44:04,767
No. That's not why I'm here.

475
00:44:06,977 --> 00:44:11,940
The article defaming Ms. Riko Hirata,
the leak about Fujiwara's scandal,

476
00:44:12,733 --> 00:44:15,569
and the scandal article
after Yuri Hara's death.

477
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:19,782
I arranged all of them
as directed by Yoko Kodama.

478
00:44:20,574 --> 00:44:22,201
I am truly…

479
00:44:24,286 --> 00:44:25,913
I am truly sorry for what l did!

480
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:33,796
I know what Aso did to Ms. Riko…

481
00:44:35,089 --> 00:44:37,675
and to several other women.

482
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:38,801
I knew…

483
00:44:39,843 --> 00:44:42,805
and turned a blind eye
to it all this time.

484
00:44:44,223 --> 00:44:49,228
If it's not too late,
I want to provide my testimony.

485
00:44:50,104 --> 00:44:51,313
Please!

486
00:44:58,278 --> 00:44:59,154
Akashi.

487
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:12,042
Why did you suddenly decide
that you want to testify?

488
00:45:12,793 --> 00:45:17,339
I want to stop Kodama Productions
and Ms. Yoko herself, with my testimony!

489
00:45:21,677 --> 00:45:25,973
If you're truly willing
to provide your account,

490
00:45:26,056 --> 00:45:28,183
it will raise the article's credibility.

491
00:45:30,352 --> 00:45:31,770
Are you really sure?

492
00:45:33,605 --> 00:45:35,065
I'm prepared.

493
00:45:37,943 --> 00:45:39,111
I understand.

494
00:45:39,695 --> 00:45:41,321
I'll start editing at once.

495
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:43,407
Please wait!

496
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:48,454
Can we stop the publication?

497
00:45:49,288 --> 00:45:51,665
-What?
-Ma'am, what are you saying?

498
00:45:51,748 --> 00:45:57,463
If we keep going, we'll be no different
from Kodama Pro and their methods.

499
00:45:59,715 --> 00:46:03,969
I think we should take responsibility
for the information we put out there.

500
00:46:05,345 --> 00:46:10,058
If we don't, we can't truly change
the current situation.

501
00:46:18,734 --> 00:46:21,945
In the process
of our independent investigation,

502
00:46:22,029 --> 00:46:24,406
we obtained several testimonies

503
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:27,326
from people who were
sexually assaulted by Actor A.

504
00:46:28,202 --> 00:46:30,871
Given the similarities in his methods,

505
00:46:30,954 --> 00:46:35,834
we think there's a high likelihood
he regularly engages in sexual assault.

506
00:46:36,877 --> 00:46:39,254
As for the particulars of this case,

507
00:46:39,338 --> 00:46:44,176
we shall not share any details as we
have handed the case over to the police.

508
00:46:45,886 --> 00:46:48,847
Furthermore, an article was posted online,

509
00:46:48,931 --> 00:46:53,435
defaming a woman
who tried to speak out about this case,

510
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:56,230
accusing her of faking it
for settlement money.

511
00:46:56,313 --> 00:46:59,233
The contents of this article
are utterly baseless,

512
00:46:59,316 --> 00:47:02,110
and we are considering
legal action in response.

513
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:08,575
Are you talking about the accusation
against Hideto Aso that blew up online?

514
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:10,911
Wasn't that a false accusation?

515
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:12,287
-Right.
-What about it?

516
00:47:12,371 --> 00:47:14,122
As I said earlier,

517
00:47:14,206 --> 00:47:17,417
I will not share any details
as to the particulars of the case.

518
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:19,753
Then why did you hold
this press conference?

519
00:47:19,836 --> 00:47:21,838
-Give us an explanation!
-Right!

520
00:47:21,922 --> 00:47:27,177
If you're not going to tell us anything,
how do we know your claims are true?

521
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:28,303
-Yes!
-Exactly!

522
00:47:28,387 --> 00:47:30,681
Give a proper explanation!

523
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:34,017
I will now call upon Ms. Ioka,
representing Rafale,

524
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:36,228
and Hirata, a Weekly Buncho reporter,

525
00:47:36,311 --> 00:47:39,565
to explain the purpose
of this press conference.

526
00:47:52,077 --> 00:47:54,037
I'm Ioka, CEO of Rafale.

527
00:47:54,997 --> 00:47:58,792
I have been investigating
Actor A's sexual assault allegations,

528
00:47:58,875 --> 00:48:02,254
alongside Ms. Hirata, who is a reporter.

529
00:48:03,088 --> 00:48:05,507
But as was mentioned earlier,

530
00:48:05,591 --> 00:48:11,013
I decided that it was best not to share
the details of the investigation here.

531
00:48:12,681 --> 00:48:13,640
Nevertheless,

532
00:48:14,641 --> 00:48:17,019
I called upon you today

533
00:48:17,686 --> 00:48:22,024
to ask you to reexamine
what gets treated as truth

534
00:48:22,608 --> 00:48:24,943
in news reportings these days.

535
00:48:26,445 --> 00:48:28,905
Weekly magazines, TV, and online news.

536
00:48:28,989 --> 00:48:32,284
Faced with a torrent
of information in various media,

537
00:48:32,367 --> 00:48:35,871
how can anyone be sure
whether that information is true?

538
00:48:35,954 --> 00:48:39,499
I'll tell you how. It gets reported
because that's what the facts say!

539
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:40,500
-Yes!
-Exactly!

540
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:46,465
I agree that facts are indisputable,
but the truth is a different matter.

541
00:48:47,424 --> 00:48:51,011
That's because the truth
that the news media portrays

542
00:48:51,094 --> 00:48:55,265
is fabricated by arbitrarily
omitting and twisting the facts.

543
00:48:56,016 --> 00:48:59,436
And at times, that fabricated truth…

544
00:49:01,521 --> 00:49:03,106
can take lives.

545
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:10,238
Ms. Hirata over there is a reporter
for Weekly Buncho, right?

546
00:49:10,822 --> 00:49:14,368
What do you make
of Ms. Ioka's comments just now?

547
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:17,120
I share the same sentiment as her.

548
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:23,585
Are you saying that you've been reporting
twisted versions of the truth until now?

549
00:49:24,461 --> 00:49:26,004
Perhaps I have.

550
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:35,013
It's all too easy to twist the truth
to your liking in a magazine article,

551
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:39,017
while avoiding responsibility
by keeping your name and face hidden.

552
00:49:39,976 --> 00:49:45,065
Today, we chose to avoid that
by speaking directly to you.

553
00:49:47,859 --> 00:49:51,071
Are you accusing us
of spreading fake news?

554
00:49:53,031 --> 00:49:56,284
Let me ask you then.
How many of you can swear

555
00:49:56,368 --> 00:49:59,538
that you've only ever
written factual information?

556
00:50:01,081 --> 00:50:03,375
Journalism provides
a great service to society

557
00:50:03,458 --> 00:50:07,838
by bringing concealed facts
to the public's attention,

558
00:50:07,921 --> 00:50:09,506
through magazines or otherwise.

559
00:50:09,589 --> 00:50:12,300
But there's a negative side to it too.

560
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:17,180
I don't think it's controversial to state
that some amount of scandals

561
00:50:17,264 --> 00:50:20,934
are portrayed in a skewed manner
due to industry power dynamics.

562
00:50:21,935 --> 00:50:27,649
Those with authority dilute the truth
and spread narratives of their liking.

563
00:50:27,733 --> 00:50:28,734
And sometimes,

564
00:50:28,817 --> 00:50:33,989
the news media itself manufactures a truth
that's more likely to stir up the public.

565
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:37,242
People then believe
that manufactured truth

566
00:50:37,325 --> 00:50:40,996
and use it as justification
to bring harm to others.

567
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:44,583
Sometimes, even threatening their lives.

568
00:50:45,834 --> 00:50:48,837
Let's stop perpetuating this cycle.

569
00:50:49,963 --> 00:50:53,467
Do you have any proof
of such manipulation of information?

570
00:50:54,468 --> 00:50:57,095
For one example,
the higher-ups at Weekly Buncho

571
00:50:57,179 --> 00:50:59,848
were in a secret alliance
with a major talent agency,

572
00:50:59,931 --> 00:51:04,895
and suppressed an article on the
aforementioned sexual assault allegations.

573
00:51:04,978 --> 00:51:07,189
Sir, did you know about this?

574
00:51:18,867 --> 00:51:19,910
In addition to that,

575
00:51:19,993 --> 00:51:24,706
this major talent agency ignored
the situation, despite being aware of it,

576
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:27,626
and even tried
to cover it up using its influence.

577
00:51:27,709 --> 00:51:30,170
An inside source confirmed that to us.

578
00:51:31,630 --> 00:51:33,006
Was that you?

579
00:51:36,259 --> 00:51:40,096
Furthermore, as for why this incident
happened in the first place,

580
00:51:40,597 --> 00:51:46,311
I am of the opinion that an old-fashioned
and flawed management style is to blame.

581
00:51:48,355 --> 00:51:54,778
While Actor A himself obviously deserves
punishment for his alleged sexual assault,

582
00:51:55,695 --> 00:52:00,075
the victims of his assault
did not simply remain silent.

583
00:52:00,826 --> 00:52:06,706
They were robbed of their voice and forced
to live in fear, shame, and solitude.

584
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:12,754
No matter how esteemed they may be
or how many fans they may have,

585
00:52:13,505 --> 00:52:17,467
someone who tramples on another's dignity
doesn't deserve to stand on stage.

586
00:52:19,636 --> 00:52:23,265
I refuse to let Actor A
get away with what he's done.

587
00:52:24,307 --> 00:52:28,395
However, I believe there's more
that needs to be done.

588
00:52:29,604 --> 00:52:35,652
He is a product of the old system that
yet exists in the entertainment industry.

589
00:52:36,903 --> 00:52:42,826
The management was lenient on him due to
his status, and no one could condemn him.

590
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:46,037
The women who fell victim to him

591
00:52:46,746 --> 00:52:50,750
were faced with the fear of losing their
careers if they stood up against him.

592
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:57,465
He was allowed to roam free
and create even more victims.

593
00:52:58,508 --> 00:53:03,763
This incident could very well
be called a man-made tragedy,

594
00:53:04,389 --> 00:53:08,727
caused by the negligence
and irresponsibility of the industry.

595
00:53:09,394 --> 00:53:12,731
You used to be a part of
Kodama Productions before, didn't you?

596
00:53:12,814 --> 00:53:15,025
Why didn't you speak up back then?

597
00:53:15,108 --> 00:53:17,235
-Right!
-Answer that!

598
00:53:17,319 --> 00:53:18,737
It's as you say.

599
00:53:19,321 --> 00:53:22,282
I was once part of Kodama Productions.

600
00:53:23,366 --> 00:53:25,994
I can't deny that
I overlooked many issues,

601
00:53:26,077 --> 00:53:29,080
all to stay in line
with the agency's customs.

602
00:53:30,790 --> 00:53:33,251
I can't erase my past.

603
00:53:33,835 --> 00:53:36,338
I share part of the responsibility.

604
00:53:38,673 --> 00:53:41,718
That's why I'm sitting here today.

605
00:53:43,011 --> 00:53:45,472
Nothing will change
just by wallowing in regret.

606
00:53:46,306 --> 00:53:49,976
There are systemic issues
that we need to put an end to.

607
00:53:51,102 --> 00:53:55,440
Favoritism, negligence,
success built on sacrificing others.

608
00:53:56,191 --> 00:54:00,362
We can't hand over such customs
to the next generation.

609
00:54:00,445 --> 00:54:03,406
I believe that putting
an end to these customs

610
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:08,662
is a duty borne by all of us,
but especially myself as a participant.

611
00:54:09,287 --> 00:54:11,331
This is how we take responsibility.

612
00:54:15,251 --> 00:54:20,173
I call for a third-party investigation
into the actor involved in this case.

613
00:54:20,256 --> 00:54:22,926
As well as the agency
he is affiliated with.

614
00:54:23,885 --> 00:54:26,388
If the agency suffers
from systemic issues,

615
00:54:27,055 --> 00:54:29,641
then I believe it should
be dissolved entirely.

616
00:54:29,724 --> 00:54:31,518
You don't know a thing.

617
00:54:32,268 --> 00:54:34,104
You don't know a thing!

618
00:54:34,688 --> 00:54:37,107
To hell with your preaching!

619
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:41,736
Ioka is right!

620
00:54:42,487 --> 00:54:44,572
We have to take responsibility!

621
00:54:44,656 --> 00:54:45,907
Responsibility?

622
00:54:46,574 --> 00:54:49,285
Why do I have to take responsibility?

623
00:54:50,912 --> 00:54:53,581
Ms. Yoko, what's going on
with this press conference?

624
00:54:53,665 --> 00:54:55,000
Why haven't you stopped it?

625
00:54:55,083 --> 00:54:56,751
It's your job to--

626
00:54:58,586 --> 00:55:00,630
Who do you think you are?

627
00:55:01,464 --> 00:55:03,550
Whose fault do you think this is?

628
00:55:03,633 --> 00:55:04,467
Ma'am!

629
00:55:04,551 --> 00:55:08,013
The agency's been backed
into a corner because of you!

630
00:55:08,805 --> 00:55:11,725
It's your fault!

631
00:55:11,808 --> 00:55:13,852
It's your fault!

632
00:55:14,477 --> 00:55:18,690
Do you even know how hard
I've had to work?

633
00:55:19,274 --> 00:55:20,900
All because of you!

634
00:55:22,027 --> 00:55:25,989
-Do you have any idea what you did?!
-Ma'am. Please stop.

635
00:55:26,072 --> 00:55:27,699
Calm down!

636
00:55:27,782 --> 00:55:30,118
-Ma'am!
-It's all your fault!

637
00:55:34,831 --> 00:55:36,875
Issues with the agency's customs?

638
00:55:38,209 --> 00:55:40,420
Well, I didn't create them.

639
00:55:41,337 --> 00:55:42,505
My father did!

640
00:55:43,923 --> 00:55:46,009
I was trying to change them!

641
00:55:48,887 --> 00:55:50,722
Until this happened!

642
00:55:54,517 --> 00:55:58,688
It's true that you inherited
the company from Mr. Shigeru.

643
00:55:59,773 --> 00:56:04,069
But you didn't try to change
the agency at its core.

644
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:08,865
If they pulled in numbers
or were popular enough,

645
00:56:08,948 --> 00:56:11,576
you'd overlook any unreasonable behavior.

646
00:56:11,659 --> 00:56:13,286
And if something happened,

647
00:56:13,369 --> 00:56:17,874
you'd hire a reporter and bend the truth
to protect the talent's reputation.

648
00:56:18,374 --> 00:56:22,045
But we should have changed our ways.

649
00:56:22,921 --> 00:56:25,256
And if we couldn't,
we should have ended it.

650
00:56:29,594 --> 00:56:30,678
That was…

651
00:56:32,347 --> 00:56:34,641
Mr. Shigeru's final wish.

652
00:56:37,811 --> 00:56:40,230
The dissolution of Kodama Productions.

653
00:56:41,439 --> 00:56:45,110
That's what was in the will
that you kept hidden.

654
00:57:04,129 --> 00:57:06,464
The chairman knew that
the customs of Kodama Pro

655
00:57:06,548 --> 00:57:08,508
had fallen behind the times.

656
00:57:09,092 --> 00:57:10,635
I expect she'll be angry.

657
00:57:12,637 --> 00:57:14,055
Once she finds out.

658
00:57:14,139 --> 00:57:16,891
Why not tell her directly?

659
00:57:18,435 --> 00:57:21,479
Do you really think she'll listen?

660
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:26,985
She takes after me.

661
00:57:29,988 --> 00:57:33,491
I could only ever teach her
the methods I knew myself.

662
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:43,877
I'm leaving her…

663
00:57:46,713 --> 00:57:48,506
in your care.

664
00:57:56,514 --> 00:57:58,349
Screw that!

665
00:58:00,852 --> 00:58:03,021
How dare he act like that now?

666
00:58:08,026 --> 00:58:11,821
He never did anything fatherly for me.

667
00:58:15,825 --> 00:58:18,495
He clung to the agency until the end…

668
00:58:20,371 --> 00:58:22,624
and died as if he was running away.

669
00:58:24,083 --> 00:58:26,836
And then he does this at the end?!

670
00:58:31,007 --> 00:58:32,383
Why have I…

671
00:58:38,139 --> 00:58:41,059
What have worked for all this time?

672
00:58:47,941 --> 00:58:49,108
Pardon me.

673
01:00:00,054 --> 01:00:03,891
I came to this conference today
for the sake of someone dear to me,

674
01:00:03,975 --> 01:00:09,939
and above all, to grant myself
an opportunity to move forward.

675
01:00:11,065 --> 01:00:12,734
Even if my voice is small,

676
01:00:12,817 --> 01:00:16,904
I wanted to let it be heard
instead of choosing silence.

677
01:00:18,323 --> 01:00:19,782
But now,

678
01:00:19,866 --> 01:00:25,872
I am certain that all the people in this
venue and those listening to us elsewhere,

679
01:00:25,955 --> 01:00:30,209
have received our message loud and clear.

680
01:00:36,424 --> 01:00:41,012
I believe that at this very moment,
we are standing at a crossroads.

681
01:00:42,263 --> 01:00:48,811
We live in a time of great schism
between the old and new values.

682
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:54,692
But I believe that it is
in that very chaos

683
01:00:54,776 --> 01:00:57,987
that true change can manifest.

684
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:03,159
It takes courage to change.

685
01:01:04,869 --> 01:01:08,206
The act of speaking out
is accompanied by pain.

686
01:01:09,332 --> 01:01:11,876
But despite that…

687
01:01:13,211 --> 01:01:14,754
I want to believe.

688
01:01:16,297 --> 01:01:19,676
That we have the power to change.

689
01:01:22,136 --> 01:01:27,809
It is not someone else who will change,
but all of us individually.

690
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:31,771
Speak up.

691
01:01:32,605 --> 01:01:33,856
Have doubts.

692
01:01:34,816 --> 01:01:37,193
Have empathy for the pain of others.

693
01:01:38,236 --> 01:01:42,365
That is what will help bring about change.

694
01:01:44,701 --> 01:01:45,827
The future…

695
01:01:46,828 --> 01:01:50,248
is not to be awaited, but to be created.

696
01:01:53,376 --> 01:01:57,630
I hope that this moment can be the start…

697
01:01:59,924 --> 01:02:01,592
of that change.

698
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:17,960
