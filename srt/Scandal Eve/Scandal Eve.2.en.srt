1
00:00:05,714 --> 00:00:10,927
<i>Kuryu Fujiwara, a famous actor,</i>
<i>is alleged to have drunk alcohol</i>

2
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:13,972
<i>and engaged in adultery</i>
<i>with an underage woman five years ago.</i>

3
00:00:14,055 --> 00:00:15,265
<i>Any thoughts, Mr. Kumai?</i>

4
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:20,145
<i>With regard to adultery,</i>
<i>he said that nothing sexual took place.</i>

5
00:00:20,228 --> 00:00:26,067
<i>But even if we assume that he did do so,</i>
<i>she was 19 years old at the time,</i>

6
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:28,820
<i>so he would not face</i>
<i>any legal repercussions.</i>

7
00:00:28,903 --> 00:00:31,990
<i>And he seems to have</i>
<i>resolved it with his wife as well.</i>

8
00:00:32,073 --> 00:00:33,324
<i>It does seem so.</i>

9
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:38,288
<i>The problem is,</i>
<i>they were photographed drinking together.</i>

10
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:40,290
<i>Yes, these are the pictures.</i>

11
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:43,710
<i>Maybe he should take</i>
<i>some time off from work.</i>

12
00:00:43,793 --> 00:00:46,045
<i>I don't think people want to see him,</i>

13
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:51,885
<i>knowing that he got an underage girl drunk</i>
<i>and took her to a hotel.</i>

14
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:54,095
- Moeka. Morning.
<i>- We haven't heard anything…</i>

15
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:55,138
Good morning.

16
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:57,515
- What are you up to?
- Nothing.

17
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:02,687
KURYU FUJIWARA DRANK
AND CHEATED WITH AN UNDERAGE GIRL

18
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:04,481
It's all over social media.

19
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:09,027
And every news program
has been talking about it all day.

20
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:15,033
As for the show he's a part of,
I doubt they'll be able to keep him on.

21
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:22,540
What an unfortunate situation for Kuryu,
even if he did bring this upon himself.

22
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:25,835
We could have protected him
if he was still with us.

23
00:01:26,669 --> 00:01:27,629
You sound happy.

24
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:33,968
Dad.

25
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:36,846
Don't you think
you're overestimating Ioka?

26
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,142
If you let someone get away
with poaching a talent

27
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:44,270
and branching off
from the agency they owe so much to,

28
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:46,523
we'd have no order in this industry.

29
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:49,109
Order, you say?

30
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:51,236
Yes, why?

31
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:58,952
You just don't get it, do you?

32
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:13,258
Mr. Chairman.

33
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:18,972
Just leave the agency's affairs to me
and focus on resting.

34
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:27,188
<i>The press conference</i>
<i>backfired on him. If he hadn't held it…</i>

35
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:28,523
Good morning.

36
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:31,609
Kanade, the Fujiwara article
is the talk of the town.

37
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:34,320
All the morning news programs
are talking about it.

38
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:37,323
The underage drinking is a big no-no.

39
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:39,993
- Good job discovering that.
- Thanks.

40
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:42,537
And? Don't tell me that's all you have.

41
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,664
Well, who can say?

42
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:47,750
- Mizuguchi? Come here.
- Yes.

43
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:52,255
Sir.

44
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:54,340
- The contract.
- Right.

45
00:03:05,226 --> 00:03:08,479
Mr. Ueda,
I'm really sorry for the trouble--

46
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:11,024
The client, Aoi Beer, sent a response.

47
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:16,362
I'm afraid it's mostly bad news for you.

48
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:20,909
First of all, your contract
with Aoi Beer will be terminated.

49
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:25,079
Any and all commercials
featuring Mr. Fujiwara will not be aired,

50
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:27,290
and all outdoor ads will be removed.

51
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:32,420
Secondly, and I know
this is what concerns you most.

52
00:03:32,503 --> 00:03:34,505
The indemnities?

53
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:38,843
The client is asking for this sum
as reparation for Mr. Fujiwara's conduct.

54
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,263
TOTAL AMOUNT 306,480,000 YEN

55
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:43,389
Three hundred million?!

56
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:46,684
It includes minor costs
such as filming and labor,

57
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:49,812
but the biggest component
is the damage to their brand.

58
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:51,481
Wait, but…

59
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:56,194
Still, isn't 300 million a bit too much?

60
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:59,739
I understand the cancellation fees
and the filming costs, but--

61
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:03,576
"If a talent's misconduct causes
severe reputational damage to the brand,

62
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,037
the brand has a right to be indemnified."

63
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,665
It's written in the advertising contract.

64
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:13,753
Aoi Beer sees it as a disrepute
for one of their contracted talents

65
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:16,798
to be in the news
for drinking with an underage girl.

66
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:19,092
Three hundred million is a fair ask.

67
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:20,802
Um…

68
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:24,722
Can I get a chance to talk directly
to Aoi Beer's representative?

69
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:28,768
Give me a break!

70
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:33,564
How much extra work
do you think we've already had to do?

71
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:36,442
Talk to them directly?

72
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:38,695
You'll just make them angrier.

73
00:04:44,742 --> 00:04:47,787
Three hundred million?
We'll go under if we have to pay that.

74
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:50,581
- Could we get a bank to finance it?
- There's no chance.

75
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:54,085
No bank would be willing
to finance us after this scandal.

76
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:57,171
And Fujiwara's projects
keep getting cancelled.

77
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:59,590
At this rate, even his drama role might…

78
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:02,302
Noguchi, the producer, contacted me.

79
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:05,054
He said Kuryu might get replaced.

80
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:06,264
That's just…

81
00:05:06,347 --> 00:05:08,725
Saki, welcome back.

82
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:11,769
- I checked the contract with Aoi Beer.
- And?

83
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:15,732
Sadly, the clause about your liability
in causing reputational damage

84
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:21,070
to their brand makes it difficult
for you to refute their demand.

85
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:23,656
So we have no choice
but to shut up and pay?

86
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,618
There might be one way to avoid it.

87
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:29,329
Huh?

88
00:05:31,372 --> 00:05:32,332
CONTRACT

89
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:36,586
I checked the contract
between this agency and Mr. Fujiwara.

90
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,008
This clause says,

91
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:46,262
"If the talent's private conduct
causes any damage to the agency,

92
00:05:46,345 --> 00:05:48,848
the talent may be held liable
for the damages."

93
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:51,350
Wait, are you saying

94
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:54,771
we make Fujiwara pay the money
instead of us?

95
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:57,315
If you do, the agency will survive.

96
00:05:57,398 --> 00:05:58,816
- But that…
- Are you serious?

97
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,986
It's 300 million yen!
Fujiwara can't pay that much.

98
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,404
Can your agency pay it?

99
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:07,116
If you keep trying to protect
Mr. Fujiwara,

100
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,286
your agency might become unable
to sustain itself financially.

101
00:06:10,369 --> 00:06:13,706
How will you justify that
to your other talents?

102
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:15,249
That's…

103
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:18,669
I'll go talk to Kuryu.

104
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:53,621
Ms. Mirei, where are you…

105
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:55,748
It's none of your business.

106
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:05,925
In the end,
I just made myself look like a fool.

107
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:11,180
Our lives are in shambles,
and it's because of you and him.

108
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:17,979
I shouldn't have let you coax me into it.

109
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,163
- Can I ask some questions?
- No.

110
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:36,164
Out of my way.

111
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:39,750
Stay away.
Can't you see I'm carrying a baby?

112
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:42,378
Stop it!

113
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:45,214
Don't push!

114
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:53,222
<i>In other news,</i>

115
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:57,268
Weekly Buncho<i> published a story</i>
<i>on the actor Kuryu Fujiwara,</i>

116
00:07:57,351 --> 00:08:01,856
<i>alleging that he drank alcohol</i>
<i>and had an affair with an underage woman.</i>

117
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:05,526
<i>According to the article,</i>
<i>he met the woman in 2021,</i>

118
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:08,237
<i>when she was 19 years old.</i>

119
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:10,531
<i>After drinking together,</i>

120
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:13,951
<i>he spent the night with her</i>
<i>at a hotel in Yokohama.</i>

121
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:20,291
<i>The article contains pictures</i>
<i>showing the two of them drinking.</i>

122
00:08:20,374 --> 00:08:23,211
<i>- And also, lying in a bed together.</i>
- Kuryu.

123
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:26,506
<i>He's receiving strong backlash,</i>
<i>especially on social media.</i>

124
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:31,719
<i>- His agency hasn't given any statement--</i>
- Saki…

125
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:35,848
I brought some food. Eat up.

126
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:41,604
What's…

127
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:45,316
going to become of me?

128
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:51,322
What about the show and the ads?

129
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:55,701
It's bad, isn't it?

130
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:57,912
The indemnities and all.

131
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:06,337
I'm so horrible. I troubled you so much.

132
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:10,049
And the agency.

133
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:15,805
I know an apology won't fix anything.

134
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:20,851
I'll do something about the money.

135
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:25,856
Do something, how?

136
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:28,693
I…

137
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:33,114
You can't do anything about it alone.

138
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:42,665
What do you think we're here for?

139
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:54,760
I'm sorry.

140
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:58,806
Saki…

141
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:05,896
There's no time for crying.

142
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:12,069
I came here to ask you something.

143
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:14,614
About that day.

144
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,366
I need more details.

145
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:27,668
Hello there.

146
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:35,009
You were in Mr. Fujiwara's room, right?
How is he doing?

147
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,805
It seems like his wife left.

148
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:43,434
I can't really blame her,

149
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:46,812
especially after she swallowed
her pride for that press conference.

150
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:50,358
I guess it completely backfired, huh?

151
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:56,197
Would you mind giving me
a comment instead?

152
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,532
About Mr. Fujiwara's future plans.

153
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:04,664
Can I assume he will be taking a break?

154
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:08,417
He has to pay for breaching
his contract with Aoi Beer, no?

155
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:12,546
You're Kanade Hirata
from <i>Weekly Buncho</i>, right?

156
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:14,507
Yes.

157
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:15,883
You don't have to worry.

158
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:19,845
Neither my agency nor Fujiwara
will let things end like this.

159
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:24,517
Thank you for the comment.

160
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:35,194
Kagawa? Contact Mr. Tozaki for me.

161
00:11:35,277 --> 00:11:37,613
Tell him I need his help urgently.

162
00:11:37,696 --> 00:11:38,864
<i>Understood.</i>

163
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:43,327
And also, reschedule
all my plans for tomorrow.

164
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:45,287
<i>What? But why?</i>

165
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:48,165
I'll go meet that woman.

166
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:06,767
Here's all the info we have
on Moeka Tanabe.

167
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:11,147
She used to be a member
of Mr. Fujiwara's fan club.

168
00:12:12,022 --> 00:12:14,942
She currently works
as a dentist's assistant in Yokohama.

169
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:17,445
INVESTIGATION RESULTS

170
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:19,822
What will you do with this information?

171
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:22,408
When he met Moeka Tanabe that night,

172
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:25,995
Kuryu said that he asked her age,
and she said she was 20.

173
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:29,081
I see! So Mr. Fujiwara was lied to?

174
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:32,710
Aoi Beer is demanding compensation
on the basis of Fujiwara's misconduct

175
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:36,589
causing severe reputational damage
to their brand.

176
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:39,341
However, if Moeka Tanabe
joined a drinking party

177
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:41,218
while falsifying her age,

178
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:42,928
Fujiwara's not to blame.

179
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:47,516
If we can prove that,
we might avoid paying indemnities!

180
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,644
But Mr. Fujiwara's admission alone
won't count for much.

181
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:54,398
That's why I'll get Moeka Tanabe herself
to give her admission.

182
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,526
That she lied about being of age
and was drinking.

183
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,821
Then, if I can get
other magazines to publish her account…

184
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:02,615
You can alter public perception

185
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:06,076
to make Mr. Fujiwara
seem like a victim instead of a wrongdoer.

186
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,077
Exactly.

187
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:09,955
But do you think
she'll agree to it that easily?

188
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,168
I'll make her do it.
We don't have any other options.

189
00:13:15,252 --> 00:13:19,215
There's also one more thing
I need you to investigate for me.

190
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:21,926
Investigate what?

191
00:13:32,686 --> 00:13:34,855
Topics for next week's issue.

192
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:36,148
Tell me what you've got.

193
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:38,776
- Let's go with--
- Sir.

194
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:41,237
Let’s follow up
on Fujiwara as the cover story.

195
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,949
For the first article, I tracked down
Moeka Tanabe, the woman he was with,

196
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:47,409
and found out
that she was underage at the time,

197
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:49,662
but she refused to tell me more.

198
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:51,872
I feel like she's hiding something.

199
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:53,707
- I want to talk to her again--
- No!

200
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:55,376
What?

201
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:58,754
Ninomiya does the cover story
on the Chief Secretary's affair.

202
00:13:58,837 --> 00:14:00,631
- But sir--
- Mizuguchi!

203
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:04,510
How about the illegal gambling
of Nansei University's rugby club?

204
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:06,929
Yes, sir.

205
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:10,808
The bar with the underground casino
was members-only, so I couldn't enter it,

206
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:13,435
but I managed to talk
to a club member as they left.

207
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,312
According to them, an alumnus…

208
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:18,816
Sir, why won't you allow
another article on--

209
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:19,942
It's already enough.

210
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:22,862
It doesn't seem like
any new facts will come out.

211
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:26,574
How about interviewing the people
from the bar he drank at that day?

212
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:27,825
I know where it is.

213
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:30,119
It won't make as big of a splash.

214
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:31,287
I disagree.

215
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:34,790
It's best to do a follow-up
while it's still being talked about.

216
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,043
Leave the Fujiwara story alone.

217
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:40,296
But why?

218
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:45,426
All I asked you was to confirm
with his agency and write an article.

219
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:48,262
I didn't ask you
to get in touch with Moeka Tanabe.

220
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:49,388
But…

221
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:54,768
But that was the reason
I found out about the underage drinking.

222
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:04,612
Go assist Ninomiya with his story.

223
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:34,558
I can't believe he's stopping me
from doing a follow-up story.

224
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:37,603
He's the one who assigned me
the story in the first place.

225
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:39,813
Yeah, it's not like him at all.

226
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:43,067
Normally, he just tells us
to go for whatever will sell.

227
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:44,276
Right?

228
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,739
I'm looking for Mr. Ninomiya
from <i>Weekly Buncho</i>.

229
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:50,324
Do you have an appointment?

230
00:15:52,242 --> 00:15:54,703
I haven't been able
to get in touch with him.

231
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:57,414
He won't answer my calls.

232
00:15:58,082 --> 00:15:59,208
I'm sorry.

233
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:02,962
But unless you have an appointment,
I can't help you.

234
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:09,510
Might as well drop it, if he says so.

235
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:12,471
It could hurt your prospects
if you make him angry.

236
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:15,474
Your goal is to transfer to
the literature department, right?

237
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:17,726
That's not relevant to this.

238
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:21,814
Maybe there's a reason
he doesn't want you to dig deeper.

239
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:22,815
Mizuguchi!

240
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:24,817
Would you do me a favor?

241
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,110
What?

242
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:32,282
ACCOUNT STATEMENT
DEPOSIT - BUNCHO 3,000,000 YEN

243
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,048
Mr. Ninomiya.

244
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:49,591
What?

245
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:53,512
Hello. It's Mizuguchi.
I'm here as your substitute assistant.

246
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:55,222
Staking out that hotel?

247
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:56,348
What about Hirata?

248
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:59,393
She went somewhere,
saying she had something to do.

249
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:02,229
Went where?

250
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:08,152
Did you see the news about Kuryu Fujiwara?

251
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:12,156
I did. Apparently the hotel
in the pictures is in this area.

252
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:14,116
Wait, seriously?

253
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:17,494
I can't believe the woman
sold the pictures to a magazine.

254
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,539
Maybe it's revenge for a one-night stand.

255
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:23,917
He said they didn't do it, though.

256
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:26,503
Yeah, but can you take his word for it?

257
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:29,965
Excuse me.

258
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:32,051
You're Ms. Moeka Tanabe, right?

259
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:34,470
Yes, why?

260
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:37,806
I am Saki Ioka from Rafale.

261
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:40,350
Rafale?

262
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:41,810
AFFILIATED ACTORS
KURYU FUJIWARA

263
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:46,273
I'd like to talk to you
about your involvement with Fujiwara.

264
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:49,193
Please let me talk to you.

265
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:50,778
I have nothing to say.

266
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:52,488
I need a favor from you.

267
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:53,947
That's not my problem.

268
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:58,035
I promise you,
this is important for you too.

269
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:08,879
Chief Kodama, I deeply apologize
for the delay in filming

270
00:18:08,962 --> 00:18:11,507
caused by the matter with Fujiwara.

271
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:18,722
We can't keep Mr. Aso's schedule open
for much longer.

272
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:21,725
If this continues,
we might even have to reconsider

273
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:24,394
Mr. Aso's participation
in this project altogether.

274
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:26,355
Please, is there any way--

275
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:29,274
How does your station
intend to handle things?

276
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:34,905
Alright, we'll drop Kuryu Fujiwara.

277
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:38,534
We'll resume filming
as soon as a substitute is decided.

278
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:42,454
In that case, may I suggest
Ichinose, one of our talents?

279
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:43,872
Ichinose?

280
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:47,084
He fits the same archetype,
and his schedule is open.

281
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,210
Please wait.

282
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:50,587
Isn't it too early to do a recast?

283
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:52,339
How so?

284
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:57,344
Mr. Fujiwara's agency says
they're still checking the details.

285
00:18:57,427 --> 00:18:58,262
What?

286
00:18:59,054 --> 00:19:01,098
What makes you think that matters?

287
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:02,474
Mr. Noguchi.

288
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:06,186
It was your decision
to cast Kuryu for the role, wasn't it?

289
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:08,230
Yes.

290
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:13,861
I understand your attachment,
but do you understand the situation?

291
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:21,785
You conspired with Ms. Ioka

292
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:25,622
and went directly to the chairman
to get him to allow Kuryu's involvement.

293
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:29,751
I assume you're belittling
me and my authority.

294
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:34,423
If you keep behaving like this,

295
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:38,927
maybe I need to reconsider
our relationship with your company.

296
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:45,017
I will have all of our talents
withdrawn from JBS projects.

297
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:47,311
Please forgive us!

298
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:51,231
I'll get my superiors' approval
for Kuryu's replacement right away.

299
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:53,192
So please. Noguchi!

300
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:57,613
I apologize.

301
00:19:58,238 --> 00:19:59,198
We apologize!

302
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:02,201
Get to it quickly, would you?

303
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:04,703
Yes, most certainly.

304
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:06,622
Let's go.

305
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:20,177
You're the one in these pictures, right?

306
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:24,264
I assume you're already aware,

307
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:28,143
but an article written
about you and him caused a big fuss.

308
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:31,271
But this isn't my fault--

309
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:35,817
Back then, you lied to Fujiwara
and told him you were of age, didn't you?

310
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:39,404
Fujiwara told me.

311
00:20:41,114 --> 00:20:44,826
You hid the fact that you were underage
and joined the drinking party.

312
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:47,079
None of it was Fujiwara's fault.

313
00:20:47,162 --> 00:20:49,373
I want you to go public with that story.

314
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,544
We'll arrange the means.

315
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:57,130
We promise to protect your privacy.

316
00:20:57,214 --> 00:21:00,217
We won't blame you
for leaking these photographs.

317
00:21:00,717 --> 00:21:02,135
Wait a second.

318
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:05,180
I wasn't the one
who gave the pictures to the magazine.

319
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:10,310
I'm not happy about it
becoming such a big deal either.

320
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:14,147
If it wasn't you, then who was it?

321
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:18,235
I'd like to know that myself.

322
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,908
I understand your situation.

323
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:29,579
That makes it even more important
for you to let the public know.

324
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:32,124
What? I don't want to.

325
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:34,543
I'd become the target if I did that.

326
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:38,547
I'm already terrified
that people might dox me.

327
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:41,883
Even if you do nothing,
you've already been identified.

328
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:46,722
The public is convinced
that you leaked this story.

329
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:49,516
And they will bash you
as soon as news comes out.

330
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:52,602
They might indeed expose
your personal information.

331
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:55,022
Not to mention,

332
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:59,401
you were a member
of Fujiwara's fan club, weren't you?

333
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:05,824
If people find that out,
other fans might come after you.

334
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,203
Your job might be at risk too.

335
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:15,792
Even if this is a private affair,
if your workplace finds out,

336
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:19,338
there's a good chance
that you'll lose your job.

337
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:24,593
Are you threatening me?

338
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:26,845
I'm saying this for your sake.

339
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:33,810
For both our sakes,
let's put this matter to rest quickly.

340
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:37,689
You lied about your age
and joined the party.

341
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:40,317
Nothing happened between you and him.

342
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,070
And you weren't the one who made the leak.

343
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:45,739
I want you to go public
with these three facts.

344
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:55,832
It's getting late.

345
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,418
I have to get back to work.

346
00:22:59,002 --> 00:23:00,754
I need some time to think.

347
00:23:00,837 --> 00:23:04,091
Can I meet you again
after you get off work today?

348
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:06,134
I will contact you.

349
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:16,394
- Kagawa.
- Yeah?

350
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:17,521
Your phone's ringing.

351
00:23:17,604 --> 00:23:19,815
Thanks. Talk to you later.

352
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:27,447
Hello?

353
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:28,532
<i>Hello, Kagawa?</i>

354
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:31,368
- I talked to Moeka Tanabe.
<i>- Seriously?</i>

355
00:23:31,451 --> 00:23:33,662
I think I can get her admission tonight.

356
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:36,289
Did you arrange a publisher?

357
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:38,667
Weekly Journal<i> should work.</i>

358
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:41,795
Okay. For the writer,
let's go with Ms. Fukumoto.

359
00:23:41,878 --> 00:23:44,464
She wrote a special feature
on Fujiwara before.

360
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:45,966
Got it.

361
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:47,926
<i>And also,</i>

362
00:23:48,426 --> 00:23:51,972
the one who sold the pictures
to <i>Buncho </i>wasn't Moeka Tanabe.

363
00:23:52,055 --> 00:23:55,100
What? Then who was it?

364
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:57,185
Oh, I see.

365
00:24:01,439 --> 00:24:02,440
What?

366
00:24:03,191 --> 00:24:04,276
Sorry, it's nothing.

367
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:20,250
Hello? Saki Ioka speaking.

368
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:21,459
Ms. Ioka.

369
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:25,630
Behind the scenes,
they're trying to replace Fujiwara

370
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:27,591
with Ichinose from Kodama Productions.

371
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,052
When will it be finalized?

372
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:33,263
It's awaiting
executive approval right now.

373
00:24:33,346 --> 00:24:36,224
It’s expected
to be finalized by early next week.

374
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:38,727
There's no stopping it after that point.

375
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:43,899
In other words, there's still a chance
to stop it right now, correct?

376
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:45,650
What?

377
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:47,903
Thank you for the call.

378
00:24:56,411 --> 00:25:00,957
<i>It's Tanabe.</i>
<i>Can you come to this place at 7:00 p.m.?</i>

379
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:03,335
<i>I will talk to you there.</i>

380
00:25:24,272 --> 00:25:26,024
So it's just as I thought.

381
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:28,318
Thank you.

382
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:54,803
Have a seat.

383
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,907
Sorry if I kept you waiting.

384
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:16,825
Not at all.

385
00:26:22,372 --> 00:26:25,709
So, have you decided?

386
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:28,545
Will you give your statement?

387
00:26:31,881 --> 00:26:32,716
Yes.

388
00:26:35,218 --> 00:26:36,678
I'm very grateful.

389
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:52,569
Before I do it,
will I get any compensation for it?

390
00:26:54,487 --> 00:26:56,948
Yes, though it'll be a meager sum--

391
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:58,033
Thirty million yen…

392
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:02,412
I want 30 million yen.

393
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:05,373
I won't give my statement otherwise.

394
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:10,211
If you want my statement,
you'll have to give me the money.

395
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:14,049
What happened? Where's this coming from?

396
00:27:15,425 --> 00:27:16,384
That's…

397
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:17,844
Well…

398
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:23,016
Mind if I butt in?

399
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:28,772
Moeka is one of our regulars.

400
00:27:29,397 --> 00:27:31,900
She told me about what's going on.

401
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:38,865
I get that things are tough for you,

402
00:27:38,948 --> 00:27:43,328
but she'd be putting a lot on the line
by making a public statement.

403
00:27:44,704 --> 00:27:47,499
Given the risk you're forcing her to take,

404
00:27:47,582 --> 00:27:50,710
it's only natural for you
to pay her at least this much.

405
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:53,213
I don't see how this concerns you.

406
00:27:53,296 --> 00:27:55,423
She asked for my help, you see.

407
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:01,554
You threatened her, didn't you?

408
00:28:03,723 --> 00:28:06,559
That she'd get fired
if people found out about it.

409
00:28:08,686 --> 00:28:12,107
Ain't no surprise
that she'd freak out after hearing that.

410
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:14,401
Right?

411
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:20,907
You want Moeka's statement, don't you?

412
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:24,327
Then just pay up!

413
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:30,291
Fujiwara's acting career
depends on it, doesn't it?

414
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:35,713
Convinced yet?

415
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:40,051
I see.

416
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:43,930
So you put her up to it,
Mr. Masafumi Okada.

417
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:46,725
What?

418
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:52,188
You invite talents to your bar
and have women attend to them.

419
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:54,566
I hear that you're the one

420
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:58,194
who arranged the drinking party
with Kuryu and Moeka at this bar.

421
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:01,406
And what about it?

422
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:04,659
We have a lawyer specialized
in the entertainment industry.

423
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:09,664
<i>According to his investigation,</i>
<i>it turns out you were involved in</i>

424
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:12,834
<i>a suspicious number</i>
<i>of scandals in recent years.</i>

425
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:16,212
So it's just as I thought.

426
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:18,631
Thank you.

427
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:33,271
You sell the details of scandals from
celebrities coming to your bar, right?

428
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:39,861
Did you show him
the pictures with Fujiwara?

429
00:29:42,405 --> 00:29:43,615
I have.

430
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:45,658
But I never gave the data!

431
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:48,203
If you come here regularly,

432
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:51,164
it's easy for him
to copy it when you're drunk.

433
00:29:52,248 --> 00:29:53,082
What? But then…

434
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:57,086
Is he the one who sold
the pictures to the magazine?

435
00:29:57,837 --> 00:29:58,922
Well?

436
00:30:01,257 --> 00:30:02,509
Did you?

437
00:30:04,427 --> 00:30:07,388
Please! Answer me! Why?

438
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:09,599
- You ruined--
- Shut up!

439
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:11,434
Pipe down!

440
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:18,775
Do you have proof
that I sold the pictures?

441
00:30:19,692 --> 00:30:20,610
Do you?!

442
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:23,404
It's all speculation!

443
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:26,783
You want her statement, right?

444
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:30,245
Then shut up and pay up!

445
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:34,833
And if you don't feel up to it,

446
00:30:36,626 --> 00:30:38,753
you're going to have a bad time.

447
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:40,797
Got it?!

448
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:45,802
You're the one
who's going to have a bad time.

449
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:52,267
I've recorded this entire conversation.

450
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:59,482
You regularly invite underage girls
to drinking parties

451
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,318
and knowingly serve them alcohol.

452
00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:06,489
If this fact gets out,
you'll be in legal trouble.

453
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:08,575
This place would go out of business.

454
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:18,668
If people know that you bring
underage girls to drinking parties

455
00:31:19,335 --> 00:31:21,921
to get dirt on celebrities and sell it,

456
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:25,383
no one will ever come to you again.

457
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:30,763
That would be bad
for your business, right?

458
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:35,602
And you too.

459
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:39,105
Nothing good will come
of being involved with him.

460
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:42,108
You need to respect yourself more.

461
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:48,197
Let's go somewhere else.

462
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:55,371
Too bad for you.

463
00:31:57,957 --> 00:31:58,958
Wait.

464
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:02,170
You're wrong about one thing.

465
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:04,088
Not that it's my problem.

466
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:07,842
- What do you--
- Just get the hell out!

467
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:09,010
Damn it.

468
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:25,318
Wait.

469
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:27,445
I'm sorry.

470
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:31,449
Are you willing
to give your statement now?

471
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:33,618
Yes.

472
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:51,678
Excuse me.

473
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:54,514
We're not open yet. Come back later.

474
00:32:54,597 --> 00:32:56,474
I work for <i>Weekly Buncho</i>.

475
00:32:57,642 --> 00:32:59,310
Mr. Masafumi Okada, right?

476
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:01,646
Is this a good time to talk?

477
00:33:10,613 --> 00:33:14,659
<i>Weekly Journal </i>reports
that the woman who was with Mr. Fujiwara

478
00:33:14,742 --> 00:33:18,621
<i>had lied about her age</i>
<i>to participate in a drinking party.</i>

479
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:19,998
<i>Any thoughts, Mr. Kumai?</i>

480
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:25,086
<i>Right. Well, Mr. Fujiwara</i>
<i>was deceived in this instance,</i>

481
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:27,422
<i>so you could say he's the victim here.</i>

482
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:33,302
<i>I think the people in the media,</i>
<i>as well as on online platforms,</i>

483
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:38,850
<i>who bashed him without waiting for details</i>
<i>should feel ashamed of themselves.</i>

484
00:33:38,933 --> 00:33:41,978
These people are so thoughtless.

485
00:33:42,061 --> 00:33:44,272
They've completely reversed
their position.

486
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:46,024
That's how they always are.

487
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:48,234
<i>Everyone just jumped to conclusions.</i>

488
00:33:48,317 --> 00:33:50,945
<i>You have to feel for him.</i>

489
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:51,863
Hello?

490
00:33:51,946 --> 00:33:53,364
<i>His career was threatened…</i>

491
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:54,282
Right.

492
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:56,951
<i>…and his reputation damaged</i>
<i>all based on speculation.</i>

493
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:57,869
Yes.

494
00:33:58,953 --> 00:34:00,329
Is that so?

495
00:34:01,247 --> 00:34:03,041
Understood. Bye.

496
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:06,085
Who was it?

497
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:07,795
The chief.

498
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:10,173
Things got resolved with Aoi Beer.

499
00:34:10,798 --> 00:34:15,094
Given that Fujiwara wasn't at fault,
they won't demand any compensation.

500
00:34:15,678 --> 00:34:17,096
Thank goodness.

501
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:19,849
Not just that, he's still in the show too.

502
00:34:21,642 --> 00:34:24,270
Wow, what a relief.

503
00:34:24,353 --> 00:34:27,231
<i>It seemed uncertain</i>
<i>if the show to commemorate</i>

504
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:30,902
<i>JBS TV's 70th anniversary</i>
<i>would even make it to the screen.</i>

505
00:34:30,985 --> 00:34:32,278
Mr. Chairman!

506
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:34,405
What is the meaning of this?

507
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:36,324
Of what?

508
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:40,453
<i>…so I imagine</i>
<i>he can get back to work immediately.</i>

509
00:34:40,536 --> 00:34:41,829
<i>I'd say that--</i>

510
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:44,540
Kuryu's replacement.

511
00:34:45,374 --> 00:34:49,921
I heard that you personally intervened
right as it was about to be approved.

512
00:34:50,004 --> 00:34:51,547
You heard right.

513
00:34:53,716 --> 00:34:55,635
Did Ioka ask you to?

514
00:34:55,718 --> 00:34:58,387
No, I did it of my own accord!

515
00:34:58,471 --> 00:35:01,974
- But why?
- I'll tell you why.

516
00:35:10,566 --> 00:35:11,400
Are you…

517
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:13,444
Dad?

518
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:15,905
Call the doctor!

519
00:35:15,988 --> 00:35:17,573
- Okay.
- Hurry!

520
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:19,700
WAIT, SO IT WASN'T KURYU'S FAULT?

521
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:22,537
DID HE JUST GET FRAMED OR WHAT?

522
00:35:26,707 --> 00:35:28,960
Here, I brought some food for you.

523
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:31,379
Thanks.

524
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:38,427
Also, I got this.

525
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:41,097
Curry powder?

526
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:46,727
There were times
that I didn't feel like eating anything.

527
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:49,939
But I could eat anything
after I put this on it.

528
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:53,234
Believe in the curry powder.

529
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:57,864
You lost me there.

530
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:08,916
We're negotiating for you
to keep your role in the drama.

531
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:13,921
It's not over yet.

532
00:36:15,631 --> 00:36:16,883
Let's turn things around.

533
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,094
Okay.

534
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:23,848
Eat up.

535
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:27,143
Thanks for the food.

536
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:57,006
Is it good?

537
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:10,436
That good?

538
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:21,447
You can take it slow.

539
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:32,917
Hey! Watch it! Watch it!

540
00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:34,877
Relax.

541
00:37:35,836 --> 00:37:37,338
You're rushing too much.

542
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:40,466
Here, take this.

543
00:37:41,801 --> 00:37:42,718
Sorry.

544
00:37:43,844 --> 00:37:45,721
It's all over the table.

545
00:37:47,556 --> 00:37:50,810
Time of death, 4:35 p.m.

546
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:42,903
FUNERAL CEREMONY SHIGERU KODAMA

547
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:54,266
Ms. Ioka.

548
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:55,935
Mr. Noguchi.

549
00:39:57,353 --> 00:39:59,980
I hear it was quite sudden.

550
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:04,235
Yes, I'm still in disbelief.

551
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:09,448
I wish he had stayed with us longer.

552
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:12,910
The truth is,

553
00:40:13,452 --> 00:40:19,291
he was the one who put a stop
to the effort to replace Kuryu.

554
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:21,293
He was?

555
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:26,298
But now, the industry
will enter a new phase.

556
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:31,387
Kodama Productions will likely fall under
Ms. Yoko's complete control.

557
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:53,617
FUNERAL CEREMONY SHIGERU KODAMA

558
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:07,715
Can I talk to you?

559
00:41:08,424 --> 00:41:10,426
I'm Hirata from <i>Weekly Buncho</i>.

560
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:13,888
It's about Mr. Kuryu Fujiwara's scandal.

561
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:19,310
The other day, I went to Yokohama
for a second round of investigation.

562
00:41:19,393 --> 00:41:22,855
The barkeeper there
told me something intriguing.

563
00:41:23,606 --> 00:41:25,274
I see.

564
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:29,653
So you're the one
who wrote that scoop on Fujiwara?

565
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:30,571
Yes.

566
00:41:31,238 --> 00:41:34,617
I'm gathering information
for a follow-up article right now.

567
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:38,287
So you came here to ask me stuff?

568
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:40,206
I'll get straight to the point.

569
00:41:40,706 --> 00:41:43,918
Are you the one
who supplied us with the pictures?

570
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:53,385
None of you people have any clue, huh?

571
00:41:54,386 --> 00:41:55,346
What do you mean?

572
00:41:57,306 --> 00:41:59,433
Let me tell you something juicy.

573
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:01,602
Yeah, I did supply the pictures.

574
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:05,147
But not to your magazine.

575
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:08,609
- What?
- It was to Kodama Productions.

576
00:42:11,862 --> 00:42:13,656
I sold them to the person

577
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:17,826
who used to be in charge
of Kuryu Fujiwara five years ago.

578
00:42:19,453 --> 00:42:21,372
His manager? Who was it?

579
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:30,381
<i>A guy called Akashi.</i>

580
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:35,761
You bought the pictures five years ago
to try and suppress the scandal.

581
00:42:36,345 --> 00:42:39,473
Why did you decide to sell him out now,
after all this time?

582
00:42:41,517 --> 00:42:42,476
That's…

583
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:46,605
Was it to tear down Saki Ioka,
who left your agency and started her own?

584
00:42:48,607 --> 00:42:52,611
A big player in the industry
that uses underhanded tactics

585
00:42:52,695 --> 00:42:55,447
to suppress a smaller company
that threatens them.

586
00:42:56,991 --> 00:43:00,244
An exposé on the dark side
of the entertainment industry

587
00:43:00,327 --> 00:43:02,705
that has no regard for individual talents.

588
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:05,416
That'll make for a good article.

589
00:43:06,208 --> 00:43:07,918
Are you willing to talk?

590
00:43:39,366 --> 00:43:40,492
PREVIEW

591
00:43:40,576 --> 00:43:42,286
A <i>Weekly Buncho </i>reporter visited me.

592
00:43:42,369 --> 00:43:43,495
Was that a coincidence?

593
00:43:43,579 --> 00:43:44,830
What are you digging for?

594
00:43:46,123 --> 00:43:48,292
BEHIND THE SCENE OF A SCANDAL…

595
00:43:48,375 --> 00:43:49,877
<i>You understand, right?</i>

596
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:52,004
You know what you must do now.

597
00:43:52,087 --> 00:43:54,006
A NEW TRUTH REVEALS ITSELF

598
00:43:54,089 --> 00:43:55,924
<i>Do you have a moment?</i>

599
00:43:56,008 --> 00:43:57,384
<i>How did that go?</i>

600
00:43:57,468 --> 00:44:00,095
Perhaps something that was more important.

601
00:44:01,764 --> 00:44:03,807
What an amusing story.

602
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:05,100
So?

603
00:44:05,184 --> 00:44:06,977
What are you implying?

604
00:44:07,061 --> 00:44:08,979
<i>Let's make a deal, then.</i>

605
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:11,398
A BATTLE OF GIVE-AND-TAKE GONE TOO FAR

606
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:12,941
<i>One thing doesn't make sense.</i>

607
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:14,943
Why exactly this timing?

608
00:44:15,027 --> 00:44:16,403
<i>This is a critical phase.</i>

609
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:18,072
Failure is not an option.

610
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:20,240
- Why are you so invested in this story?
- I…

611
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:21,700
Stay off this case.

612
00:44:21,784 --> 00:44:24,745
Was the feud caused by the incident
from five years ago?

613
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:27,581
STEPPING INTO FORBIDDEN TERRITORY

614
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:30,459
You tabloid writers
always prey on people's lives.

615
00:44:30,542 --> 00:44:32,169
<i>I will not dance to your tune.</i>

616
00:44:32,878 --> 00:44:37,257
THE PRESSURE OF A MAJOR
AGENCY IN THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY

617
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:42,096
WHAT DEEPER DARKNESS
WILL IOKA COME TO FACE?

618
