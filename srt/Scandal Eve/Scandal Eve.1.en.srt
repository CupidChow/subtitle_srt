1
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:30,280
- Where are you? It starts in five minutes.
<i>- Five minutes?</i>

2
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:32,365
<i>I'm still in Shibuya.</i>

3
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:35,410
<i>It'll take me ten more minutes.</i>

4
00:00:35,493 --> 00:00:37,454
You'll be too late. Go faster.

5
00:00:37,954 --> 00:00:41,207
<i>I can't. I'm already at the speed limit.</i>

6
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:44,627
Park at the front when you get here.

7
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:49,799
It's been a while, Mr. Aso.

8
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:52,218
It's nice to see you again, Ioka.

9
00:00:52,844 --> 00:00:54,054
You've been doing well.

10
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:55,597
Thank you.

11
00:00:56,097 --> 00:00:58,808
Keep it up, Chief.

12
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:08,234
Mr. Aso's moving to the stage wing. Hurry.

13
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:15,575
Any luck, Chief?

14
00:01:15,658 --> 00:01:18,995
Mori found one that fits.
She's bringing it now.

15
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:22,415
How could they just change outfits
at the last minute like this?

16
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:26,795
Saki.

17
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:32,842
Was this Ms. Yoko's idea?

18
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:36,054
It's not for you to worry about.

19
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:40,391
You're up in five minutes.

20
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:41,601
- Okay.
- Okay.

21
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:46,105
- Kagawa, come with me.
- Okay.

22
00:01:56,991 --> 00:01:59,410
HIDETO ASO
KURYU FUJIWARA

23
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:04,290
Saki.

24
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,167
Saki!

25
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:08,419
Are you being serious?

26
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:11,214
We have no time. I'll go get the coat.

27
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:12,382
Yeah, but that's--

28
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:14,759
We can't lose to a petty tactic like this.

29
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:18,304
- I get that, but isn't this going a bit--
- Kagawa.

30
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:34,529
Welcome, Ms. Yoko.

31
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:35,697
- Welcome.
- Welcome.

32
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:39,117
- It's nice to see you.
- Likewise. This way, please.

33
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,004
Yes? Yes, it's fine. I have their number.

34
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:55,508
I'll get to it soon. Bye.

35
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:25,997
- Mori!
- It's in the back.

36
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:30,627
Thank you!

37
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:45,058
Hello?

38
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:47,727
<i>Is this Ms. Mori's number?</i>

39
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:52,899
<i>That was the first episode</i>
<i>of </i>Proof of Recollection<i>,</i>

40
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:55,526
<i>a show commemorating</i>
<i>JBS TV's 70th anniversary.</i>

41
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,278
<i>We hope you enjoyed it.</i>

42
00:03:58,154 --> 00:03:59,489
Thank you.

43
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:00,657
PROOF OF RECOLLECTION

44
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,743
The filming is still ongoing,

45
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:09,540
but both of the lead actors are here
for this event today.

46
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:10,792
Please welcome--

47
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:13,878
Please wait.

48
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,839
Please wait a moment.

49
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:28,017
Ms. Yoko.

50
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:31,020
What's this? Some technical issue?

51
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:32,355
I apologize.

52
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:36,025
The lighting equipment is malfunctioning.
We'll fix it promptly.

53
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:40,655
Try not to make our Aso look bad, okay?

54
00:04:40,738 --> 00:04:42,699
Of course, ma'am.

55
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:43,825
Fix it now!

56
00:04:43,908 --> 00:04:44,826
Yes, sir.

57
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:00,133
I apologize for the delay.

58
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:02,760
It looks like we're ready now,

59
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:05,054
so please welcome
both of them to the stage.

60
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:06,931
Kuryu! Hurry up!

61
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:08,141
Saki.

62
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:15,440
<i>To celebrate JBS TV's 70th anniversary,</i>
<i>we have invited Mr. Aso and Mr. Fujiwara.</i>

63
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:16,482
Wait.

64
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:18,776
<i>Give them a round of applause!</i>

65
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:21,487
Be confident. You can do it.

66
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,656
This way, please.

67
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:27,785
Thank you.

68
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:26,052
Let's see.

69
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:29,514
I think the teamwork
between the crew and the cast

70
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:32,183
comes through in the final product.

71
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:36,395
I think it will be worthy
of the 70th anniversary…

72
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:37,522
Ioka.

73
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:42,276
Sorry about the coat.

74
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:45,071
Ms. Yoko made the last-minute change.

75
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:46,948
It's just harassment.

76
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:50,368
I couldn't let Kuryu go on stage
with the same outfit as Mr. Aso.

77
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:55,456
I think you really struck a nerve

78
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:59,710
by bypassing her and getting the chairman
on board with Kuryu's return to TV.

79
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:03,548
Yeah, I underestimated her.

80
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:06,425
I didn't expect all this in return.

81
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:08,636
Be careful, okay?

82
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:11,389
Your boss is the reason
I have to be careful.

83
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:18,479
Let's get some comments
from Mr. Fujiwara now.

84
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:22,775
I believe this will be your first role
in a drama after going independent.

85
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:26,779
Well, to be honest,

86
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:30,908
these last few years,
it hasn't been easy.

87
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:34,162
But I am overjoyed to get the chance

88
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:39,167
to be on a JBS TV drama again.

89
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:56,517
That jacket.

90
00:07:57,685 --> 00:07:59,020
It suits him well.

91
00:08:01,105 --> 00:08:02,523
Thank you.

92
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:05,776
Kuryu's looking more dependable now.

93
00:08:08,112 --> 00:08:13,117
Ever since he left us and joined you,
he's been doing great.

94
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:15,953
Ms. Yoko.

95
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:20,958
Thank you for letting Kuryu
co-star with Mr. Aso.

96
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:22,710
Don't thank me.

97
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:25,713
Shouldn't you be thanking
the chairman instead?

98
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:30,510
Not at all. I'm also grateful to you.

99
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:33,304
I guess so.

100
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:39,143
You got to make the industry think
that we are on good terms, after all.

101
00:08:43,147 --> 00:08:44,190
Chief.

102
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:46,526
Excuse me. Can I talk to you?

103
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:49,695
Excuse me.

104
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:01,290
You bought enough time. Thank you.

105
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:04,669
Sure, but the thing is…

106
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:08,047
What's wrong?

107
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:13,678
A reporter from <i>Weekly Buncho </i>called me.

108
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:18,057
One of their articles this week
will be a scandal involving Kuryu.

109
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:20,059
A scandal?

110
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:15,239
Good night.

111
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:17,116
Good night to you too.

112
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:18,326
Bye.

113
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:21,329
Hey.

114
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:25,374
Saki wants to talk to you.
She's waiting in the car.

115
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,126
Okay, got it.

116
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,345
- You did well.
- Saki.

117
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:39,263
You too.

118
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:46,020
- Hey, Kuryu.
- What?

119
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:49,023
Anything strange happen recently?

120
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:50,983
Where's that coming from?

121
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:54,487
What? Did something happen?

122
00:10:57,782 --> 00:11:00,076
A reporter from <i>Weekly Buncho </i>called us.

123
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:01,702
<i>Weekly Buncho</i>?

124
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:04,205
They said they'll publish a scandal.

125
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:06,749
Is it about me?

126
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:10,920
What kind of scandal?

127
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:12,380
I don't know yet.

128
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:15,549
They'll mail us the details tomorrow.

129
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:19,261
If you know anything, tell me now.

130
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:22,765
So we can prepare.

131
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:33,609
I don't.

132
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:37,238
- Are you sure?
- Of course I am.

133
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:40,449
- Anything involving women?
- Come on, Saki!

134
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:42,201
I just had a child.

135
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:46,872
How about any drugs, gambling,
or some kind of violent--

136
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:48,082
Saki!

137
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:53,546
After I went independent,
you've known me better than anyone.

138
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:55,673
It's probably nonsense.

139
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:00,219
Right.

140
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:03,013
Sorry about that.

141
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,433
It's okay.

142
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:10,354
Let me know the details
once you get them tomorrow.

143
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:13,190
Okay, I will.

144
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:15,901
Good night.

145
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:17,695
Good night.

146
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:33,169
<i>Before I forget,</i>
<i>I have an announcement for you all.</i>

147
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:38,174
<i>My baby products brand, Twinkle Hug,</i>
<i>has been working on some new pacifiers,</i>

148
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:41,552
<i>and they're finally ready!</i>

149
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:43,804
<i>Check these out. Aren't they cute?</i>

150
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:47,016
<i>There's more with other designs too.</i>

151
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:54,773
I'll share the full details
on an official post later.

152
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:57,109
That's all for today.

153
00:12:57,193 --> 00:13:00,821
See you next time.
Bye-bye. Thanks for watching!

154
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:03,782
Welcome back.

155
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:05,326
I'm home.

156
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:08,204
How was the event?
It was a big topic online.

157
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:10,998
It went pretty well.

158
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:14,627
That's good.
Could you hold these real quick?

159
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,128
- What?
- And stand here.

160
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:17,505
Okay. What are these?

161
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:18,422
Here you go.

162
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:21,050
Oh, the samples are ready?

163
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:25,054
Yeah, preparations for the launch event
have been going smoothly too.

164
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:27,306
You have to help with the marketing too.

165
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:29,391
Yeah, sure. I will.

166
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:32,269
All good. Thanks.

167
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:38,776
Just went to sleep.

168
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:43,697
Did I wake you?

169
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,409
I'm home.

170
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:46,427
<i>Yes?</i>

171
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:51,640
Sorry for calling so late.
I'm Ioka, representing Rafale.

172
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:56,103
<i>Thank you for the call.</i>
<i>I'm Hirata from </i>Weekly Buncho<i>.</i>

173
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:59,440
<i>I didn't expect the CEO</i>
<i>to call me directly.</i>

174
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:04,486
I wanted to talk about the matter
with our talent, Kuryu Fujiwara.

175
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:08,115
<i>I'll mail you the details tomorrow.</i>

176
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:11,285
I would like to meet you in person.

177
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:13,579
<i>In person?</i>

178
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:17,625
I would like to confirm
as many of the details as possible.

179
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:20,252
To avoid any misunderstandings.

180
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:26,008
<i>Alright. Visit our office</i>
<i>at ten o'clock tomorrow morning.</i>

181
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:27,760
Understood.

182
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:30,971
I'll be there together
with an associate named Kagawa.

183
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:33,724
<i>Goodbye then.</i>

184
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,652
YURI HARA'S SUICIDE

185
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:46,612
<i>Give my Yuri back!</i>

186
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:48,364
You monster!

187
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:08,008
- Sorry, I used a business card as a note.
- It's fine.

188
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:09,802
- Who was that?
- Ms. Ioka.

189
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:13,764
- The CEO of Kuryu Fujiwara's agency.
- Kuryu Fujiwara? Why did she call?

190
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:16,350
He's going to become
the top story for this week.

191
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:18,727
Top story? That's pretty sudden.

192
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:21,021
The editor-in-chief insisted.

193
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:24,692
He must have wanted it
to coincide it with the drama interview.

194
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:26,610
You think so?

195
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:39,498
INCOMING CALL: R

196
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:44,378
- Who was that?
- What?

197
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:45,295
Nothing.

198
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,050
I'm tired.

199
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:55,139
I need a shower.

200
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:37,097
Fujiwara said he doesn't know?

201
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:39,308
Yeah, he said it must be some nonsense.

202
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:40,476
I see.

203
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:44,229
Now is a bad time
for some absurd article to get printed.

204
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:48,817
- We have to make them cancel it.
- Right.

205
00:17:57,493 --> 00:18:00,621
BUNCHO OFFICE

206
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:03,916
Thank you.

207
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:05,501
They're waiting over there.

208
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,505
Sorry for the wait.

209
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:13,133
I'm Hirata from <i>Weekly Buncho</i>.

210
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:15,260
I'm Ioka from Rafale.

211
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,305
I'm Kagawa, the vice-president.

212
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:21,558
- Sorry about the sudden appointment.
- It's fine.

213
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:25,062
- Would you prefer coffee or tea?
- Neither.

214
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:28,774
I'd like to get to business right away.

215
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:30,651
As you wish.

216
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,987
- Can you get us three coffees?
- Just a moment.

217
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:38,200
We believe that Kuryu is clean.

218
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:40,536
If this article has no basis,

219
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:43,413
we are prepared to take
strict legal action in retaliation.

220
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:45,249
It's well-founded.

221
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:49,419
Six years ago,
Mr. Fujiwara married Mirei Yoshikawa

222
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:51,338
who was an idol at the time, right?

223
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:52,256
Yes.

224
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:53,674
They're a famous couple,

225
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:57,344
and the wife even started
a baby products brand recently.

226
00:18:57,427 --> 00:18:59,930
So you've done your research. What of it?

227
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:04,226
My article is about Mr. Fujiwara's affair.

228
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:06,311
An affair?

229
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:08,272
Our company received a leak.

230
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:09,731
It said that five years ago,

231
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:13,402
he stayed overnight at a hotel
with a woman he met at a bar in Yokohama.

232
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:15,237
Five years ago?

233
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:19,366
Mr. Fujiwara was still affiliated
with Kodama Productions back then,

234
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:22,744
and I hear you weren't managing him then.

235
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:25,706
- It's natural that you don't know.
- Hold on.

236
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:28,667
You're writing an article
based on just that?

237
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:32,629
That information has no credibility,
and also, where did that leak come from?

238
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:34,214
In terms of confidentiality,

239
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:37,176
I cannot share my source
or their personal information.

240
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:40,637
Maybe so, but without knowing that,
we have no way to--

241
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:42,055
Have a look.

242
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:50,439
Is this…

243
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:55,402
That's Kuryu Fujiwara, right?

244
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:00,949
Seem more credible now?

245
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,536
Will these pictures be in the article?

246
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:05,704
Of course.

247
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,124
This is an important period for him.

248
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:12,127
What's the point
of digging up dirt from five years ago?

249
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,837
The public deserves to know.

250
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:15,339
You just think it'll sell!

251
00:20:16,506 --> 00:20:19,384
You even timed it to match
with his return to TV dramas.

252
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:22,054
So you agree
that it's Mr. Fujiwara in those pictures?

253
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:26,767
I'll mail you a questionnaire later.

254
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:28,936
This week's issue goes on sale Thursday.

255
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:30,771
Please respond by noon tomorrow.

256
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:32,189
You can have that copy.

257
00:20:32,272 --> 00:20:33,982
To confirm with Mr. Fujiwara.

258
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:40,322
Excuse me. Here's your coffee.

259
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:55,963
- Welcome back.
- Thanks.

260
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:57,756
- Hirata!
- Yes?

261
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:02,761
How's the Fujiwara thing going?

262
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:04,096
Smoothly so far.

263
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:06,014
I'll go do some field work today.

264
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,557
What field work?

265
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:10,102
I just need to look into something.

266
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:13,939
Finish the advance copy today, okay?

267
00:21:14,022 --> 00:21:14,940
Got it.

268
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,235
I'm going out for research.

269
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:19,152
Research?

270
00:21:22,155 --> 00:21:23,156
Ninomiya!

271
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:24,533
Yes?

272
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,660
You got a minute?

273
00:21:26,743 --> 00:21:27,703
Yes.

274
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:36,420
I made the deposit for you-know-what.

275
00:21:40,924 --> 00:21:42,092
Thank you.

276
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:02,237
Hello, ma'am.

277
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:04,448
Kuryu.

278
00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:08,493
This is Mr. Tozaki, our legal advisor.

279
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:09,619
I'm Tozaki.

280
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:14,124
Ms. Ioka brought me up to speed,
but I need to confirm a few things.

281
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:15,834
Okay.

282
00:22:15,917 --> 00:22:19,046
Can you confirm
that you are the one in these pictures?

283
00:22:21,965 --> 00:22:22,799
That's--

284
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:25,802
I cannot protect you
if you don't answer truthfully.

285
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:28,138
Are you the one in the pictures?

286
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:34,603
Saki. I swear, I didn't--

287
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:36,104
Answer his questions.

288
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:39,649
Mr. Tozaki specializes
in entertainment industry affairs.

289
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:42,986
And he can help you,
provided you're honest with him.

290
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:49,785
Kuryu.

291
00:22:59,294 --> 00:23:00,253
It's me.

292
00:23:02,672 --> 00:23:04,758
How long did you stay at the hotel?

293
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:06,259
What?

294
00:23:08,678 --> 00:23:11,431
I was drunk, so I went to sleep.

295
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:13,600
Until morning then. With this woman?

296
00:23:15,852 --> 00:23:16,686
Yes.

297
00:23:17,312 --> 00:23:18,563
That's awful.

298
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:22,859
But I swear, I didn't do anything!

299
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:24,361
Fujiwara, please…

300
00:23:24,444 --> 00:23:26,655
It's the truth! I didn't do anything!

301
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:31,576
I admit that I went to the hotel.

302
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:33,578
But I…

303
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:36,790
I was really drunk.

304
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:40,502
I went to the hotel
with her and entered the room,

305
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:43,630
but I went to sleep
while she was taking a shower!

306
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:47,092
- I woke up the next morning.
- Is that really all?

307
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:49,302
Any chance you forgot
because you were drunk?

308
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:51,930
None.

309
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:55,600
I swear, I didn't do anything.
It's the truth!

310
00:23:58,645 --> 00:23:59,813
Even this picture.

311
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:03,692
She took this without permission
while I was asleep!

312
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:10,657
When I woke up, I realized my mistake.

313
00:24:11,741 --> 00:24:15,579
I apologized to her
and sent her home on a taxi.

314
00:24:15,662 --> 00:24:19,166
If so, why is she naked in the picture?

315
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:21,543
I already told you.

316
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:26,047
She took a shower,
and I went to sleep first!

317
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:28,884
I'm wearing a shirt in this!
I'm wearing clothes!

318
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:35,015
I'm telling the truth!

319
00:24:35,515 --> 00:24:36,766
You have to believe me!

320
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:40,729
I regretted going there
and ended things immediately.

321
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:42,647
Trust me!

322
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:47,194
I didn't cheat on my wife.

323
00:24:51,489 --> 00:24:53,617
Okay, I will trust you.

324
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:56,828
- Saki--
- But the public won't.

325
00:24:57,662 --> 00:25:00,916
You spent a long time
in a hotel with this woman,

326
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:03,251
and could have engaged in sexual acts.

327
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:07,380
Even if a magazine calls it adultery,
it will be hard to sue for libel.

328
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:10,091
- But…
- The issue isn't whether you did it.

329
00:25:11,092 --> 00:25:14,971
If they call it adultery in an article
and the public believes what's written,

330
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:18,308
the facts won't stop it
from becoming the truth.

331
00:25:18,391 --> 00:25:19,809
But that's just…

332
00:25:20,727 --> 00:25:24,397
Can we negotiate with the publisher
and get them to retract the article?

333
00:25:25,148 --> 00:25:27,609
It will be tough
for a company of your size.

334
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:29,611
Maybe Kodama Productions could do it.

335
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:35,158
In addition, while you
could claim it's a violation of privacy,

336
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:40,705
the law permits the act of reporting
on public personalities like yourself.

337
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:44,000
If you did in fact
stay at the hotel with her,

338
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:45,502
we can't stop the article.

339
00:25:46,503 --> 00:25:49,881
If the article blows up,
you will most likely lose your drama role.

340
00:25:50,465 --> 00:25:51,383
Not to mention,

341
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:55,595
you have advertisement contracts
with companies that operate nationally.

342
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:57,973
You might have to pay
huge sums in reparations.

343
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:01,685
What? But…

344
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:07,899
Why? But wait, that's not…

345
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:10,360
Why? It doesn't make any…

346
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,279
I didn't even…

347
00:26:12,362 --> 00:26:13,571
I already told you.

348
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:17,867
Going to the hotel in itself
is the issue, even if you did nothing.

349
00:26:21,454 --> 00:26:24,457
Mori, call the production companies
we're working with.

350
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:26,543
Cancel all filming from tomorrow onward.

351
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:30,213
We can buy a few days
if we say he caught the flu.

352
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:32,132
Okay.

353
00:26:33,216 --> 00:26:34,884
- Kagawa, come.
- Yes, ma'am.

354
00:26:44,894 --> 00:26:46,396
What do we do?

355
00:26:46,479 --> 00:26:49,482
If we can't stop it,
we have to minimize the damage.

356
00:26:50,483 --> 00:26:53,570
We won't know how bad it will be
until it comes out.

357
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:54,904
Then we…

358
00:26:56,614 --> 00:26:58,658
We'll do whatever we can.

359
00:27:01,494 --> 00:27:03,330
Hello, this is Ioka speaking.

360
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:05,665
Are you at the TV station, Mr. Noguchi?

361
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:08,585
I need to talk to you
about an urgent matter.

362
00:27:09,085 --> 00:27:11,254
Yes, can I come over there now?

363
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:13,548
Okay.

364
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:18,678
I'm very sorry for the trouble
our Fujiwara has caused you.

365
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:21,681
An apology doesn't exactly help us.

366
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:22,599
I know.

367
00:27:22,682 --> 00:27:25,185
An adultery scandal at this time?

368
00:27:25,685 --> 00:27:28,438
Is that article really coming out?
Couldn't you stop it?

369
00:27:28,938 --> 00:27:30,940
We're trying, but it seems difficult--

370
00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:32,817
What will you do about this?

371
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:35,820
You're the one who pushed
this casting choice, Noguchi.

372
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:37,155
I'm sorry, sir.

373
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:41,034
Does Ms. Yoko know about this mess yet?

374
00:27:41,117 --> 00:27:42,160
No, not yet.

375
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:47,791
Man, why did this have to happen
before I got reshuffled?

376
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:51,961
At any rate, I will report this.

377
00:27:52,462 --> 00:27:54,130
Man…

378
00:27:56,674 --> 00:27:59,719
I'm really sorry for the trouble.

379
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:02,305
It's not always a given

380
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:05,725
that an adultery scandal
will lead to a show getting cancelled.

381
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:08,353
It's all up to the public's reaction.

382
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:11,940
Will the drama be able to air
if the article doesn't blow up?

383
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:13,483
I think so.

384
00:28:13,566 --> 00:28:16,152
But it'll be bad
if it gets too much attention

385
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:18,905
and the sponsors get concerned.

386
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:22,033
I'll try to handle that too.

387
00:28:23,743 --> 00:28:26,246
In any case, I have to tell Ms. Yoko.

388
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:29,999
I'll contact her on my end too.

389
00:28:33,294 --> 00:28:34,671
Goodbye.

390
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:50,019
- Hello?
- I checked the advance copy.

391
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:51,312
SHAMEFUL NIGHT IN YOKOHAMA

392
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:52,397
<i>How is it?</i>

393
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:55,442
The rest is fine.

394
00:28:55,525 --> 00:28:58,153
So fill in the conclusion
and send it to me again.

395
00:28:58,653 --> 00:29:00,655
Then I'll send it for proofreading.

396
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:04,075
Got it. Can you wait
on the proofreading, though?

397
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:06,327
I might rewrite parts of it.

398
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:07,662
What?

399
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:11,458
All right, but where are you right now?

400
00:29:12,208 --> 00:29:14,002
Sorry, I'll call you later.

401
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:41,446
You don't say.

402
00:29:42,238 --> 00:29:43,364
Kuryu, huh?

403
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,242
I am deeply sorry.

404
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:50,163
You were gracious enough
to grant him an opportunity,

405
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:53,625
and the drama with Mr. Aso
was just getting started.

406
00:29:55,418 --> 00:29:56,628
And?

407
00:29:59,088 --> 00:30:00,548
What will you do?

408
00:30:02,675 --> 00:30:06,012
I want to stop it
from being covered by news programs.

409
00:30:06,095 --> 00:30:09,224
If we can manage that,
the damage will be minimized.

410
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:11,810
So you came to ask me a favor.

411
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:17,232
Chairman, there's no need for you to act.

412
00:30:18,107 --> 00:30:19,108
Yoko.

413
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:23,571
I heard about the thing with Kuryu.

414
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:25,323
It's a shame.

415
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:31,329
But do you remember
what you said when you left us?

416
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:35,792
You can't nurture actors by giving them
lead roles that they haven't earned.

417
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:42,465
I will nurture actors
with a different method.

418
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:45,718
You said you would survive
in this industry with methods

419
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:47,512
different from ours.

420
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:50,682
Those were your words.

421
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:58,106
Considering that, your actions now
are far too self-serving, aren't they?

422
00:31:02,777 --> 00:31:03,903
Please.

423
00:31:07,156 --> 00:31:08,324
How pitiful.

424
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:15,415
He's a talent under your wing.
You should be fixing his mess.

425
00:31:15,498 --> 00:31:17,750
That's what your job is.

426
00:31:21,629 --> 00:31:22,755
Excuse me.

427
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:24,674
Ioka.

428
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:30,847
Don't be so quick to lower your head.

429
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,406
Akashi?

430
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:53,202
Kuryu's spot is opening up in that drama.

431
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:57,832
Compile a list of potential substitutes
and send it to me.

432
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:07,717
Hello?

433
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:10,887
<i>Ms. Ioka, this is Hirata</i>
<i>from </i>Weekly Buncho<i>.</i>

434
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:13,264
<i>It's past the deadline</i>
<i>for the questionnaire.</i>

435
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:14,641
<i>Did you fill it out?</i>

436
00:32:20,813 --> 00:32:22,523
I'm Saki Ioka from Rafale.

437
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:24,108
Over there.

438
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:32,450
Thank you for coming.

439
00:32:37,705 --> 00:32:41,709
First of all, I would like to confirm
your answers to the questionnaire.

440
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:44,712
Is the man in the picture Kuryu Fujiwara?

441
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:48,257
Does Mr. Fujiwara admit
to engaging in infidelity?

442
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:50,593
How will your agency respond to this?

443
00:32:55,848 --> 00:32:59,227
If you're willing to confirm
the claims made in the article,

444
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:02,689
the wording and tone used
in it can be adjusted to an extent.

445
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:12,073
This is?

446
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:19,872
It's two million yen.

447
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:25,044
You're trying to bribe me into silence?

448
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:27,880
I can't say.
You're recording this, aren't you?

449
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,552
You don't have a clue, do you?

450
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:36,931
With all the attention
around Kuryu Fujiwara,

451
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:39,517
how much do you think
this article will make?

452
00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:44,689
Magazine sales, online views,
licensing fees from news media.

453
00:33:44,772 --> 00:33:48,192
Up to 100 million yen is a safe bet.
And you just offer two million?

454
00:33:50,069 --> 00:33:51,946
What's the point of this article?

455
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:55,616
All it will do is
damage Kuryu and his family!

456
00:33:56,951 --> 00:33:58,036
Let me ask you.

457
00:33:58,119 --> 00:34:00,288
Why do you think magazines sell so much?

458
00:34:02,331 --> 00:34:04,042
It's simply retribution.

459
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:05,543
Retribution?

460
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:08,963
Entertainers sell an image,
including their private lives.

461
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:12,175
In return, they get
to lead luxurious lives.

462
00:34:12,675 --> 00:34:15,970
If they abuse their position
and secretly engage in foul behavior,

463
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:18,139
they should pay the price for it.

464
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:21,476
And it's our duty
to expose their deception.

465
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:24,353
That doesn't justify
ruining someone's life.

466
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:26,939
His wife and child
are the biggest victims, right?

467
00:34:27,857 --> 00:34:29,942
Don't act like he's the victim here.

468
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:33,696
Mr. Fujiwara is the one
who brought this upon himself.

469
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:39,744
Once again,

470
00:34:39,827 --> 00:34:44,165
can I take it that your agency admits
the person in the photo is Mr. Fujiwara?

471
00:34:47,001 --> 00:34:48,127
Ms. Ioka?

472
00:34:49,003 --> 00:34:50,671
Excuse me. I have to leave.

473
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:02,058
Come in.

474
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:23,621
Well?

475
00:35:25,998 --> 00:35:26,833
I'm sorry.

476
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:28,709
I don't want an apology.

477
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:32,004
I want an explanation!

478
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:40,638
It's true that I went to the hotel.

479
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:45,518
I was drunk and went to sleep.
That's all that happened.

480
00:35:46,102 --> 00:35:47,061
That's all?

481
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:49,438
What do you mean?

482
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:56,821
You went to a hotel
with a woman and all you did was sleep.

483
00:35:58,948 --> 00:36:01,325
Do you think anyone will believe that?!

484
00:36:04,036 --> 00:36:06,414
Who's going to buy any of this?!

485
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:10,168
Who'd want to use baby products
sold by an adulterer and his wife?!

486
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:11,335
Mirei!

487
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:13,921
Who would ever buy these pacifiers?!

488
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:20,469
Ms. Mirei!

489
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:22,430
Calm down!

490
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:24,015
Get off me!

491
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:26,184
Get out!

492
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:35,026
If only Kuryu had never gone to you.

493
00:36:36,819 --> 00:36:40,615
If only he had stayed with Ms. Yoko,
it would never…

494
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:45,661
This article would never
have seen the light of day!

495
00:36:46,662 --> 00:36:48,998
It's all over now!

496
00:36:49,081 --> 00:36:50,041
It's all over!

497
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:53,711
How could you?!

498
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:56,589
How could you do this?!

499
00:36:58,049 --> 00:36:59,842
What will I do now?

500
00:37:01,135 --> 00:37:02,803
It's not over yet.

501
00:37:08,976 --> 00:37:12,355
I won't let this be the end.

502
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:22,657
Chief, are you serious
about holding a press conference?

503
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:26,077
I asked Mr. Tozaki
to create a list of mock questions.

504
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:29,205
We'll make sure
the reporters are all on our side.

505
00:37:29,288 --> 00:37:32,667
But why?
Won't this just add more fuel to the fire?

506
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:35,336
We'll devalue the <i>Buncho </i>article.

507
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:41,175
If we share the facts ourselves
before the article comes out,

508
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:43,928
we can prevent
any false rumors from spreading.

509
00:37:44,553 --> 00:37:46,597
The article will get less attention.

510
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:49,892
- But--
- It's our only option!

511
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:03,322
Kuryu.

512
00:38:06,158 --> 00:38:07,368
Wait.

513
00:38:46,115 --> 00:38:50,369
I would like to thank you all

514
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:54,123
for gathering here today
on such short notice.

515
00:38:55,041 --> 00:39:01,172
<i>Today, I wanted to directly tell you</i>
<i>about an important…</i>

516
00:39:01,255 --> 00:39:03,257
Press conference by Kuryu Fujiwara.

517
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:04,800
They got the jump on us.

518
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:07,011
Our sales are going to take a big hit.

519
00:39:07,094 --> 00:39:09,180
So where's our reporter for this story?

520
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:12,266
<i>Five years ago,</i>

521
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:16,270
<i>at a friend's bar in Yokohama,</i>

522
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:21,192
I got some drinks
and later stayed overnight at a hotel…

523
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:26,030
with a woman who was at the bar.

524
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:31,619
An article about that occasion will be
published tomorrow by <i>Weekly Buncho</i>.

525
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:37,750
On that night, I was heavily drunk.

526
00:39:38,751 --> 00:39:41,712
I fell asleep immediately
after entering the hotel room.

527
00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:45,674
Nothing happened
between me and that woman.

528
00:39:45,758 --> 00:39:47,802
EMERGENCY PRESS CONFERENCE

529
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:53,057
Nevertheless,
I was a married man at the time,

530
00:39:53,682 --> 00:39:59,021
and I deeply regret my unfaithful actions.

531
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:01,148
Once the article is out,

532
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:07,905
many people will have to deal
with a lot of trouble as a result,

533
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:12,493
so I wanted to explain it in my own words.

534
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:20,960
I am deeply sorry
for bringing this upon all of you.

535
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:28,259
And after thinking long and hard

536
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:34,056
about who I had hurt most
with my thoughtless actions,

537
00:40:35,516 --> 00:40:36,684
I talked with her.

538
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:42,022
And per her request,

539
00:40:43,065 --> 00:40:49,280
my wife will be joining me
for the remainder of this conference.

540
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:53,784
Whoa!

541
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:21,937
The two of you
already settled this issue five years ago.

542
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:25,774
- I want you to go with that story.
- What?

543
00:41:25,858 --> 00:41:27,776
In the case of a cheating scandal,

544
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:31,489
whether you can recover or not
depends on public reception.

545
00:41:32,531 --> 00:41:34,950
The most effective way to resolve this

546
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:38,913
is for you to present the impression
that it's already water under the bridge.

547
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:40,122
But why should I?

548
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:42,458
I understand how you feel.

549
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:45,544
Even if nothing ultimately happened,

550
00:41:46,253 --> 00:41:49,798
Kuryu betrayed you
by going to a hotel with another woman.

551
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:53,010
Your anger is justified.

552
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:57,014
But this is for your sake too.

553
00:41:57,681 --> 00:41:58,516
What?

554
00:41:58,599 --> 00:41:59,892
At this rate,

555
00:42:00,392 --> 00:42:04,146
the reputation of your baby products brand
will be dragged through the mud.

556
00:42:04,897 --> 00:42:08,192
But if you appeal directly to the public,

557
00:42:08,275 --> 00:42:11,278
you can create a perception of yourself

558
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:14,240
as a woman who chose to work
through her husband's betrayal

559
00:42:14,323 --> 00:42:16,075
and mend her marriage!

560
00:42:18,035 --> 00:42:21,997
This could be your chance
to turn things around.

561
00:42:24,416 --> 00:42:27,378
Please. We need you.

562
00:42:37,638 --> 00:42:38,472
Well…

563
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:44,562
Back then, when he told me
what had happened,

564
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:49,275
I remember being very hurt.

565
00:42:50,609 --> 00:42:54,446
But we talked things out as a couple.

566
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:58,242
And I have already moved past it.

567
00:42:59,868 --> 00:43:03,414
That's why we wanted to make things clear

568
00:43:04,039 --> 00:43:07,710
by telling you all what happened.

569
00:43:08,502 --> 00:43:10,713
That's why we called you here.

570
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:13,340
Thank you all for coming.

571
00:43:17,219 --> 00:43:19,847
We'll take questions now if you have any.

572
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:20,764
- Yes!
- Yes!

573
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:22,766
Go with the <i>Weekly Journal </i>first.

574
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:27,104
How about you, over there?

575
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:32,776
I'm Fukumoto from <i>Weekly Journal</i>.

576
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:33,819
I have a question.

577
00:43:33,902 --> 00:43:35,487
Sorry, I didn't notice you.

578
00:43:35,571 --> 00:43:38,449
Can I have your card? Thank you.

579
00:43:38,532 --> 00:43:40,451
Ms. Ninomiya, is it?

580
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,872
Based on what your wife said,

581
00:43:44,955 --> 00:43:48,459
I take it that you immediately told her

582
00:43:48,542 --> 00:43:51,712
that you had spent the night
with that woman at the hotel?

583
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:55,883
Is that correct?

584
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:06,226
That is correct.

585
00:44:08,187 --> 00:44:14,485
I felt a strong sense of guilt,
so I told my wife as soon as I got home

586
00:44:14,985 --> 00:44:16,070
and apologized to her.

587
00:44:16,737 --> 00:44:20,157
And you two have already
resolved this between yourselves?

588
00:44:23,077 --> 00:44:26,288
Yes, that interpretation is correct.

589
00:44:26,872 --> 00:44:28,040
Thank you.

590
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:32,586
We'll take another question.

591
00:44:33,212 --> 00:44:34,296
Next is <i>Net Prime</i>.

592
00:44:34,963 --> 00:44:36,840
You may ask your question.

593
00:44:38,175 --> 00:44:40,678
I'm Nakamura from <i>Net Prime</i>.

594
00:44:40,761 --> 00:44:47,351
While you were with that woman,
did your wife go through your mind at all?

595
00:44:51,397 --> 00:44:52,815
At the time,

596
00:44:53,482 --> 00:44:58,612
I was very drunk
and do not recall things clearly.

597
00:44:59,446 --> 00:45:05,994
However, I strongly regret
the thoughtless actions I took.

598
00:45:07,329 --> 00:45:08,997
I see. Thank you.

599
00:45:09,081 --> 00:45:09,998
Mori, you there?

600
00:45:10,582 --> 00:45:11,583
Yes.

601
00:45:11,667 --> 00:45:12,960
<i>Post the comments.</i>

602
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:14,503
Roger.

603
00:45:17,297 --> 00:45:19,383
DIDN'T EVEN NEED
TO HOLD A PRESS CONFERENCE

604
00:45:22,761 --> 00:45:25,264
#KURYUFUJIWARA
SO THIS IS ALL JUST OLD NEWS?

605
00:45:28,183 --> 00:45:31,437
We'll take one last question.

606
00:45:31,937 --> 00:45:33,897
- How about--
- I have a question.

607
00:45:36,316 --> 00:45:37,985
I'm Hirata from <i>Weekly Buncho</i>.

608
00:45:38,652 --> 00:45:40,070
- What?
- Wait, what?

609
00:45:40,154 --> 00:45:42,114
- Well…
- Kagawa, end the conference.

610
00:45:42,197 --> 00:45:43,115
Actually, we--

611
00:45:43,198 --> 00:45:45,951
You say that nothing happened
between you and the woman,

612
00:45:46,452 --> 00:45:47,995
but is that actually true?

613
00:45:49,955 --> 00:45:51,248
Well, that's…

614
00:45:53,667 --> 00:45:55,586
Yes, that's true.

615
00:45:55,669 --> 00:45:56,962
How can you be sure?

616
00:45:57,713 --> 00:46:02,509
You just said your memory is hazy
because you were drunk.

617
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:03,886
That's a contradiction.

618
00:46:10,726 --> 00:46:15,147
Do you really think the public
will accept such a vague explanation?

619
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:16,815
That's right!

620
00:46:20,402 --> 00:46:23,280
<i>What do we do?</i>
<i>The comments are getting heated too.</i>

621
00:46:23,864 --> 00:46:25,157
Answer the question!

622
00:46:30,662 --> 00:46:31,997
Why…

623
00:46:35,834 --> 00:46:38,837
does it matter if the public accepts it?

624
00:46:46,053 --> 00:46:47,763
Pertaining to this issue,

625
00:46:49,932 --> 00:46:54,311
if you were to consider who,
if anyone, is the victim here,

626
00:46:56,188 --> 00:46:57,648
it would be me.

627
00:46:59,566 --> 00:47:03,987
And I trusted him
and accepted his explanation.

628
00:47:06,114 --> 00:47:08,867
If anyone deserves to judge Kuryu,

629
00:47:09,618 --> 00:47:13,372
it's neither the public nor you!

630
00:47:15,999 --> 00:47:20,837
By no means was it easy for me
to reach the point I'm at now.

631
00:47:22,339 --> 00:47:26,301
It was a struggle, but I pushed through.

632
00:47:29,012 --> 00:47:30,138
That's why…

633
00:47:31,223 --> 00:47:32,432
I'm requesting you…

634
00:47:34,434 --> 00:47:37,396
to not make it any more difficult.

635
00:47:40,482 --> 00:47:42,109
Please!

636
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:54,162
Aside from spending a night
at a hotel with another woman,

637
00:47:55,414 --> 00:47:57,457
have you committed any other

638
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:01,920
immoral acts that would betray
your loyalty to your wife?

639
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:16,059
None.

640
00:48:17,894 --> 00:48:24,610
Nevertheless, what I did
was a betrayal of her trust.

641
00:48:26,445 --> 00:48:30,532
I plan to keep making amends for it.

642
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:33,910
So please…

643
00:48:35,829 --> 00:48:37,623
give me a chance to do so.

644
00:48:49,384 --> 00:48:50,886
I have no more questions.

645
00:48:59,269 --> 00:49:01,313
SO RUDE
WHAT'S WITH THIS REPORTER?

646
00:49:01,396 --> 00:49:03,523
I FEEL BAD FOR MIREI
SHAME ON BUNCHO

647
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:06,443
That's it?

648
00:49:12,949 --> 00:49:15,077
What was Hirata thinking there?

649
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:18,830
CHEATING SCANDAL

650
00:49:18,914 --> 00:49:20,582
EMERGENCY PRESS CONFERENCE

651
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:52,948
You did well. Thank you.

652
00:49:54,366 --> 00:49:56,827
I'll try to think of it as good marketing.

653
00:50:00,539 --> 00:50:03,500
We did what we could.
Let's wait and see what happens.

654
00:50:06,545 --> 00:50:08,380
Go get some rest. You did great.

655
00:50:09,047 --> 00:50:11,508
Okay. Thank you.

656
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:23,562
<i>That went really well!</i>

657
00:50:23,645 --> 00:50:27,858
It did, though I did get thrown for a loop
when the reporter from <i>Buncho </i>showed up.

658
00:50:27,941 --> 00:50:31,278
This should weaken
the impact of the article tomorrow.

659
00:50:32,154 --> 00:50:34,489
I'll try to keep Fujiwara
in his drama role.

660
00:50:34,573 --> 00:50:35,782
Thank you.

661
00:50:36,491 --> 00:50:37,951
I'll call you later.

662
00:50:40,787 --> 00:50:42,122
Chief Ioka.

663
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,043
That was an outstanding press conference.

664
00:50:49,337 --> 00:50:51,590
Sorry for ruining your scoop.

665
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:55,510
I remember what you said

666
00:50:56,303 --> 00:50:59,139
about scandal articles
being retribution for entertainers.

667
00:51:00,265 --> 00:51:01,850
I disagree.

668
00:51:04,603 --> 00:51:05,812
It must feel so good

669
00:51:06,438 --> 00:51:10,150
to condemn others for their mistakes
while you get to be safe yourself.

670
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:14,279
But I think it's just sad.

671
00:51:17,324 --> 00:51:22,496
I think the true immoral ones
are you tabloid journalists.

672
00:51:25,874 --> 00:51:30,462
In the press conference,
it was stated that

673
00:51:30,545 --> 00:51:33,340
there was no problematic conduct,
adultery, or otherwise.

674
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:34,966
Is that correct?

675
00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:37,761
Yes, that is correct.

676
00:51:39,221 --> 00:51:40,555
Goodbye.

677
00:51:41,223 --> 00:51:45,560
The woman he was with
was 19 years old at the time.

678
00:52:02,828 --> 00:52:06,414
In other words, Mr. Fujiwara
was drinking with an underage girl.

679
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:09,584
Would you consider that an immoral act?

680
00:52:14,422 --> 00:52:19,344
Thanks to today's press conference,
everyone's thinking about Kuryu Fujiwara.

681
00:52:21,638 --> 00:52:23,974
I wonder how it will be tomorrow.

682
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:56,066
KURYU FUJIWARA DRANK
AND CHEATED WITH AN UNDERAGE GIRL

683
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:31,393
WEEKLY BUNCHO

684
00:54:52,163 --> 00:54:53,206
PREVIEW

685
00:54:53,957 --> 00:54:55,750
- Three hundred million?!
<i>- That's…</i>

686
00:54:55,834 --> 00:54:57,585
We'll go under if we have to pay that.

687
00:54:57,669 --> 00:55:00,046
IOKA IS DRIVEN INTO A CORNER

688
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:02,173
<i>I don't think people want to see him…</i>

689
00:55:02,257 --> 00:55:04,175
I shouldn't have let you coax me into it.

690
00:55:04,259 --> 00:55:06,052
I guess it completely backfired, huh?

691
00:55:06,136 --> 00:55:08,346
There might be one way to avoid it.

692
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:10,348
WHAT IS THE ONE SOLUTION?

693
00:55:10,432 --> 00:55:13,643
If we can prove that,
we might avoid paying indemnities!

694
00:55:13,727 --> 00:55:15,186
<i>I'm not happy about it either.</i>

695
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:17,939
I wasn't the one
who gave the pictures to the magazine.

696
00:55:18,023 --> 00:55:20,525
The one who sold the pictures
to <i>Buncho </i>wasn't Moeka Tanabe.

697
00:55:20,608 --> 00:55:21,943
Then who was it?

698
00:55:22,027 --> 00:55:23,695
A NEW MYSTERY SURFACES

699
00:55:23,778 --> 00:55:25,321
I feel like she's hiding something.

700
00:55:25,405 --> 00:55:26,156
No!

701
00:55:26,239 --> 00:55:27,866
<i>Leave the Fujiwara story alone.</i>

702
00:55:27,949 --> 00:55:30,785
Maybe there's a reason
he doesn't want you to dig deeper.

703
00:55:30,869 --> 00:55:32,537
DEEPER INTO THE SCANDAL

704
00:55:32,620 --> 00:55:36,207
You just don't get it, do you?

705
00:55:36,291 --> 00:55:37,333
What do you mean?

706
00:55:37,417 --> 00:55:39,085
