1
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:24,107
Hey, can you keep it down?

2
00:00:29,237 --> 00:00:31,489
I told you to keep it down.

3
00:00:32,615 --> 00:00:33,742
Hey.

4
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:50,049
What's wrong?

5
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:52,260
Nothing.

6
00:01:26,669 --> 00:01:28,379
Furusawa from the Tokyo Assembly

7
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:30,799
might have lied
about his educational background.

8
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:33,927
He claims to have graduated
from Atlanta University in the US,

9
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:36,763
but his former secretary says
he went to a vocational school

10
00:01:36,846 --> 00:01:38,389
with a similar name.

11
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:40,391
Has the university confirmed that?

12
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:43,436
They haven't responded to my email yet.

13
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,648
Then scrap it.
It's not worth spending that much time on.

14
00:01:46,731 --> 00:01:47,857
What's your last topic?

15
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:50,860
Yes, sir. Sakaida,
a famous baseball player,

16
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:55,240
is said to be slandering his teammates
on a private social media account.

17
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:56,157
Any proof?

18
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:59,077
I'll go talk
to his former teammate tomorrow.

19
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,245
Keep working on that.

20
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:01,913
Yes, sir.

21
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:04,958
Hirata, you're next.

22
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:14,425
Hirata, your topics.

23
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:16,845
I don't have any.

24
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,431
What does that mean?

25
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:22,392
Exactly what it sounds like.

26
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:25,603
I don't have any topics
suitable for this meeting.

27
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:30,483
Sorry for disappointing you.
That's all from me.

28
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:37,240
-Next.
-Yes, sir.

29
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:42,370
My first topic is an inheritance dispute
over the estate of Ichiro Iida,

30
00:02:42,453 --> 00:02:45,123
a famous businessman,
after his sudden death--

31
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:51,421
You seemed pretty on edge
in that meeting back there.

32
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:52,338
Yeah?

33
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:55,133
Yes, it even got me nervous.

34
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:57,552
-Did you really not have any topics?
-Thanks.

35
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:00,388
For the Fujiwara story,

36
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:03,433
the source was Mr. Akashi,
general manager of Kodama Productions.

37
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:05,018
Wait, the agency?

38
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:06,978
Have you confirmed that?

39
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:09,856
The barkeeper who connected
Moeka Tanabe to Fujiwara

40
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:12,108
tried to sell
that information to a magazine,

41
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:16,362
but Kodama Productions found out
and paid a huge sum to buy it.

42
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:19,240
But why leak it now after all this time?

43
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:21,117
Probably to harass Rafale.

44
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:25,079
They branched off from Kodama
while taking Fujiwara with them.

45
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:28,041
So they used us to try to ruin Fujiwara?

46
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:30,084
But didn't the editor-in-chief say

47
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:32,754
it was an anonymous leak
when he assigned it to you?

48
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:38,384
I think he knew that the source
was Kodama Productions.

49
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:40,637
What? What does that mean?

50
00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:43,640
You know that we make tons of money

51
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:47,352
from calendars and photobooks
of idols affiliated with Kodama, right?

52
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:52,148
He was the one who arranged that deal,
and became editor-in-chief as a result.

53
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:56,694
I wouldn't be surprised
if he's linked to Yoko Kodama.

54
00:03:56,778 --> 00:04:01,449
So you're saying he published that article
on Kuryu in order to help Kodama?

55
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:03,993
But that's favoritism.

56
00:04:04,827 --> 00:04:07,121
-That's why I'll write an article on it.
-What?

57
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:10,250
"The article from Weekly Buncho
bashing Fujiwara

58
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:14,379
was written in order to please
a big talent agency."

59
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:19,550
"The entertainment industry resorts
to dirty tactics to silence a magazine."

60
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:22,804
"It's time to shine a light on it all."

61
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:25,265
-How does that sound?
-But isn't that…

62
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:26,474
Don't do it.

63
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,519
The Fujiwara topic is old news now.

64
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:32,855
He ended up getting dropped
from the JBS TV special drama too.

65
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:35,984
He's out of the public eye now.
I doubt the readers care anymore.

66
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:38,069
I wonder about that.

67
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:41,823
What if Kodama was also behind him
getting dropped from the drama?

68
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:43,199
In the first place,

69
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:47,495
our editor-in-chief won't allow an article
saying we bowed down to a big agency.

70
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:49,497
It will just harm your career.

71
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:52,417
Exactly. That would be whistleblowing,
wouldn't it?

72
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,294
You could get fired.

73
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:58,131
You once told me, Ninomiya,
that the role of a reporter

74
00:04:58,214 --> 00:05:01,926
is to be the person
who says the emperor wears no clothes.

75
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:05,471
You taught me that when I just joined.

76
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:07,140
Have you forgotten?

77
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:10,018
Look, recklessness
isn't the same as bravery.

78
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:12,228
And cowardice isn't the same as caution.

79
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:14,480
Calm down, you two.

80
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:18,359
Also, why are you so fixated
on this story, Kanade?

81
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:20,903
Because it's humiliating.

82
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:22,113
What?

83
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:26,868
I hate that I was exploited into writing
an article to suck up to an agency.

84
00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:31,914
Doesn't mean you have to
throw your career away.

85
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:34,751
Provoking the editor-in-chief
could lose you your transfer

86
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:35,835
as well as your job.

87
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:46,304
I wonder why she has so much hostility
for the entertainment industry.

88
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,352
MEMORIAL FOR SHIGERU KODAMA

89
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:58,858
It's been lovely having you all here,
but it's about time to wrap up.

90
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:01,778
I would like to thank you all

91
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:06,991
for coming to commemorate my father,
Shigeru Kodama.

92
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:13,247
Building this agency
in just one generation took my father…

93
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:18,294
took the chairman
no small amount of effort.

94
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:24,092
I consider it my duty
to take Kodama Productions,

95
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:27,220
the legacy he left behind,
to even greater heights.

96
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:33,518
I hope that all of you will continue
to offer us your gracious goodwill.

97
00:06:40,274 --> 00:06:45,947
The chairman nurtured both his talents
and his employees with love and care.

98
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:51,828
Unfortunately, his sentiments
were not always answered in kind.

99
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:58,167
There were employees who left the agency,
as if biting the hand that fed them.

100
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:02,839
If we were to tolerate
such self-serving behavior,

101
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:07,468
it would threaten the very order that
our predecessors worked so hard to build.

102
00:07:08,302 --> 00:07:10,430
Let us stand united

103
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:14,058
and protect the integrity
of our shared industry!

104
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:45,715
TETSUYA IGARASHI

105
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:51,262
"For the time being, refrain from casting
any talents affiliated with Rafale."

106
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:11,657
I hear Mr. Fujiwara
was officially dropped from the show.

107
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:17,497
Why did he end up getting dropped
when the backlash had already died down?

108
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,707
Your other talents
are also getting dropped

109
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:23,044
from private productions,
one after another.

110
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:29,300
Is it not because Kodama Productions
is pressuring the industry

111
00:08:29,383 --> 00:08:30,801
to ostracize Rafale?

112
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:36,891
The one who leaked Mr. Fujiwara's scandal
was Mr. Akashi from Kodama.

113
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:43,481
I believe you two joined Kodama
around the same time.

114
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:48,194
Let's make a deal, then.

115
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:50,071
A deal?

116
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:53,824
A big player in the industry
bullying an underdog,

117
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:57,411
and a female head of a company
fearlessly fighting back.

118
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:01,207
The public loves stories like that.

119
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:04,377
Having them on your side
would be a big boon.

120
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:06,963
If the public makes noise on social media,

121
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:09,632
the sponsors and TV stations
can't just ignore it.

122
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:12,343
It might make your life a bit easier.

123
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:14,637
What's in it for you?

124
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,849
Could you tell me in detail about the feud
between you and Kodama Productions?

125
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:20,560
There's no feud between--

126
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:24,230
You left Kodama Productions
four years ago, correct?

127
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:28,025
But I hear you were antagonistic
towards Chief Kodama even before that.

128
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:29,402
That's pure speculation.

129
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:33,155
Was the feud caused by the incident
from five years ago?

130
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:39,579
I read some magazines from that period.

131
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:43,332
Ms. Ioka, please talk to me.

132
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:44,584
I refuse.

133
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:46,377
Why?

134
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:49,589
Did you forget what you did to us?

135
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:53,384
You tabloid writers
always prey on people's lives.

136
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:58,264
I will not dance to your tune.

137
00:09:58,347 --> 00:09:59,265
Ever.

138
00:10:01,892 --> 00:10:04,520
Contact me anytime
if you change your mind.

139
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:24,665
A reporter from Weekly Buncho?

140
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:25,750
Yes.

141
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:30,129
She found out from the man
who sold us the pictures back then.

142
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:33,716
Her name is Hirata,
and she came to talk to me.

143
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:36,135
Said she knew
we were the source of the leak.

144
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:40,389
Was it to tear down Saki Ioka,
who left your agency and started her own?

145
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:43,476
And how did you respond?

146
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,062
That I couldn't tell her anything.

147
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:49,231
I see.

148
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:52,276
I was too careless.

149
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:53,903
I apologize.

150
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:55,905
It won't happen again.

151
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:58,366
You understand, right?

152
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:01,994
You know what you must do now.

153
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:12,088
Be quick and sort that matter out
with the other party.

154
00:11:14,673 --> 00:11:15,549
Understood.

155
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:17,885
Please excuse me.

156
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:42,118
BUNCHO
KANADE HIRATA

157
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:01,220
By the way, I'm done with the draft.

158
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:03,139
Okay, I'll go through it later.

159
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:06,767
Mr. Ninomiya!

160
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:12,648
We need to talk.

161
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:18,988
Let's go somewhere else.

162
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:29,790
You were right.

163
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:33,878
Aside from JBS TV, other stations
are also trying to cut off Rafale.

164
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:35,129
I figured.

165
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:40,468
Can you dig deeper to find out
how exactly Kodama took action?

166
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:42,803
Okay, I'll let you know
if I have any updates.

167
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:44,096
Please do.

168
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:47,141
Ms. Hirata, I presume?

169
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:51,729
Do you have a moment?

170
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:03,365
Here's your fugu sashimi.

171
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:05,117
Thank you.

172
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:12,666
So? What would you like to know?

173
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:21,634
You have things you want
to ask me, correct?

174
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:25,804
It's about Kuryu Fujiwara's scandal.

175
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:30,100
The leak was made
by an employee from your agency.

176
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:33,646
Surely you're joking.

177
00:13:34,271 --> 00:13:36,065
I highly doubt that.

178
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:37,608
Did you order him to?

179
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:40,486
And why would I?

180
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:45,241
I hear Chairman Kodama was quite fond
of Rafale's chief, Ms. Ioka.

181
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:46,492
And four years ago,

182
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:50,371
when you became the chief,
she left the agency, along with Fujiwara.

183
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:58,003
I'm sure you had reservations about
the chairman agreeing to Fujiwara

184
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:00,339
and Aso co-starring in the JBS drama.

185
00:14:02,716 --> 00:14:04,385
What are you implying?

186
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:08,639
You wanted to punish Ms. Ioka
for going independent,

187
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:10,683
so you leaked Kuryu Fujiwara's scandal.

188
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:11,850
Am I wrong?

189
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:18,274
What an amusing story.

190
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:21,569
Shall I introduce you to an editor I know?

191
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:29,743
It's true that the chairman
had a soft spot for Saki,

192
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:31,954
and that an employee leaving the agency

193
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:34,957
while taking one of our talents
was a big blow to us.

194
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:35,875
Then--

195
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:39,086
But while Ioka was at our agency,

196
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:42,840
she was a valuable employee
who did a truly tremendous job.

197
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:47,595
Your accusations
are completely groundless.

198
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:52,391
Then, the leak was made
at the sole discretion of that employee?

199
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:58,772
If it were true that he really leaked it,
then I would say so.

200
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,317
I see.

201
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:11,535
In that case,
may I ask you about Yuri Hara?

202
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:14,371
Do you remember her?

203
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:19,585
She was an actress who Ms. Ioka
was in charge of when she was with you,

204
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:22,338
and she took her own life five years ago.

205
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:26,383
Ms. Ioka went independent
one year after that.

206
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:28,761
Was that a coincidence?

207
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:36,685
You're quite talented, Ms. Kanade Hirata.

208
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:41,190
Just as I would expect from a graduate
of the Kyushu U. Literary Department.

209
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:47,446
After graduating, you applied to Buncho
to become an editor of literary novels,

210
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:51,200
but you were assigned as a reporter
for their weekly magazine.

211
00:15:52,242 --> 00:15:55,371
In spite of that, you held strong,

212
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:59,124
and you have continued
to prove yourself in the field.

213
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,964
Your parents must be so proud of you.

214
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:10,552
Your sister, however,
seems to be an exception.

215
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,721
Well.

216
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:18,102
Please, help yourself.

217
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:22,439
No need to be so reserved.

218
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:25,109
Or do you perhaps not enjoy fugu?

219
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:28,779
No, I quite like it.

220
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,198
Then here--

221
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:38,372
I'm not fond of accepting offers
that I might regret taking later.

222
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:41,959
If you'll excuse me.

223
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:18,620
Ioka.

224
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:22,624
Been a while, huh?

225
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:25,419
Yeah.

226
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:29,381
We used to drink until morning here.

227
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:33,177
You were the only coworker
I could vent my frustrations to.

228
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:35,220
So, what's up?

229
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:39,808
I want a bottle of this
and two glasses on the rocks.

230
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,060
Coming right up.

231
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,938
You okay with that?
Out of nostalgia?

232
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:46,857
Sure.

233
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:54,073
This is all we ever drank back then.

234
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:57,826
Yeah, because it was cheap.

235
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:02,998
When you get to our age,
you get to drink good liquor more often.

236
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:05,000
And just eat out more often.

237
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:07,377
But you know…

238
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:13,634
every once in a while,
I get an intense craving for this stuff

239
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:17,137
that we used to gulp down
while venting our frustrations away.

240
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:24,019
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

241
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:35,572
What do you want this late?

242
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:39,368
You were staking out Kodama Productions.

243
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:42,287
Who told you that?

244
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:45,624
Was it Yoko Kodama?

245
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:54,466
I figured you two were connected.

246
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:55,634
So?

247
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:58,428
Did she order you
to silence the annoying reporter?

248
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:01,849
What are you digging for?

249
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:12,693
It was Kodama Productions
who leaked the Fujiwara story to us.

250
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:16,822
They wanted to punish Rafale
for branching off and taking Fujiwara.

251
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:20,200
We published the scandal on Fujiwara
to please Kodama.

252
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:24,037
If that's true,
I want to make it into an article.

253
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:25,789
It's speculation.

254
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:27,249
Are you afraid?

255
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:30,627
That they'll revoke our benefits
if we criticize them?

256
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:39,136
In the first place, we can't publish
that kind of article anyway.

257
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:40,554
And why is that?

258
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:43,807
Weekly Buncho has fiercely exposed
other people's wrongdoings,

259
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:46,143
so shouldn't we be
just as strict on ourselves?

260
00:19:46,226 --> 00:19:48,228
Those are two different matters.

261
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:51,565
Fine, I'll publish it somewhere else.

262
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:53,901
Do you really think you'll be able to?

263
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:55,986
Who's going to stop me?

264
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:57,613
Yoko Kodama?

265
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:08,373
Are you obeying Yoko Kodama
despite knowing the full story?

266
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,417
Why?

267
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,836
Does she have some dirt on you?

268
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:24,431
Why are you so invested in this story?

269
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:28,936
I'm not.

270
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:32,648
I just don't like
being taken advantage of.

271
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,862
-I will--
-Stay off this case.

272
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:41,073
I refuse.

273
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:44,993
If you want to keep working
at this company,

274
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:48,163
you will stop pursuing this case.

275
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:50,290
Okay?

276
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,853
Remember that?

277
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:15,274
When Aso got double-booked for work
in both Sendai and Fukuoka,

278
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:17,859
and we only found out on that morning?

279
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:20,070
-I really freaked out.
-Right?

280
00:21:20,153 --> 00:21:22,990
Thanks again for helping with that one.

281
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:26,618
It's fine. You helped me
on plenty of occasions too.

282
00:21:27,577 --> 00:21:32,165
I went through a lot over there,
but I always trusted you and the chairman.

283
00:21:45,887 --> 00:21:47,848
A Weekly Buncho reporter visited me.

284
00:21:51,351 --> 00:21:54,396
Said you were the one
who leaked the Fujiwara story.

285
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:58,191
Did you?

286
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:06,658
I'm sorry.

287
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:11,413
I was jealous.

288
00:22:12,914 --> 00:22:16,126
You started your own agency
and carved out your own path.

289
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:23,258
When I first heard you were leaving,
I honestly didn't think you'd make it.

290
00:22:24,092 --> 00:22:24,968
Awful, right?

291
00:22:28,346 --> 00:22:29,181
And yet…

292
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:32,976
you slowly but surely earned repute…

293
00:22:34,394 --> 00:22:37,189
and Fujiwara managed to return to TV.

294
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:42,194
Meanwhile, I'm still just a lapdog
for my agency.

295
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:47,365
I'm the "general manager,"
but all I do is follow the chief's orders.

296
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:53,663
I just felt so pathetic.

297
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,501
That's why…

298
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:01,588
I wanted to get in your way.

299
00:23:03,006 --> 00:23:04,132
So I did all that.

300
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:13,308
Did you really do it of your own will?

301
00:23:17,854 --> 00:23:18,855
Yeah.

302
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:22,025
It was all my decision.

303
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:24,903
I'm sorry.

304
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,834
You're not pathetic.

305
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:42,963
After going independent,

306
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:46,633
I learned how impressive it is
to stay with an organization.

307
00:23:46,716 --> 00:23:50,178
So I can understand
how tough your position is.

308
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:54,516
I also get that sometimes

309
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:58,311
you have to make uncomfortable decisions
to protect an organization.

310
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:03,900
Not to mention, you have a family.

311
00:24:06,069 --> 00:24:08,613
You have to look after
your wife and children.

312
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:13,910
I'm sorry.

313
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:25,881
I should get going.

314
00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:29,092
Okay.

315
00:24:31,469 --> 00:24:32,971
Thanks for coming.

316
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:34,389
Yeah.

317
00:24:41,354 --> 00:24:43,523
Can I get the bill?

318
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:46,484
Yes, sir. Please wait a moment.

319
00:24:57,204 --> 00:25:00,248
Weekly Buncho acts like
they're some force of justice

320
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:01,791
or whatever to the public,

321
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:03,585
but they're just cowards.

322
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:04,753
Kanade.

323
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:07,088
-Can I have more of this?
-Sure.

324
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:09,382
You're drinking too much. Are you okay?

325
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:11,051
No, I'm not okay.

326
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:15,305
If weekly magazines
can only survive by bowing down

327
00:25:15,388 --> 00:25:20,435
to the shitty entertainment industry,
then they're already done for.

328
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:24,064
I've been wanting to ask,

329
00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:26,441
what's with your bias
against show business?

330
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:29,694
You seem to hate it a bit too much.

331
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:32,697
I can sense it in your articles, too.

332
00:25:33,281 --> 00:25:37,077
It feels almost like
it's bordering on obsession.

333
00:25:38,286 --> 00:25:39,287
Is there a reason?

334
00:25:42,165 --> 00:25:45,126
Sorry, no need to answer
if you don't want to.

335
00:25:49,297 --> 00:25:51,591
Show business destroyed something of mine.

336
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:53,677
What? Destroyed what?

337
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,679
-Here you go, ma'am.
-Thanks.

338
00:25:55,762 --> 00:25:57,681
-What about you?
-I'll have more too.

339
00:25:57,764 --> 00:25:59,224
Okay, coming right up.

340
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:03,144
Also, did you hear about Mr. Ninomiya?

341
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:04,646
You didn't hear the talk

342
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:07,565
about the young woman
who barged into our office?

343
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:09,651
-Not really.
-Guess what?

344
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:12,195
I saw the two of them together today.

345
00:26:13,154 --> 00:26:16,491
Looked like it might be
some kind of romantic trouble to me.

346
00:26:30,171 --> 00:26:31,298
I drank too much.

347
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:33,883
-You feeling okay?
-Just drunk.

348
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:36,970
Sorry, Mizuguchi. I'm going home first.

349
00:26:37,053 --> 00:26:37,971
Okay, thanks.

350
00:26:38,054 --> 00:26:38,930
See you later.

351
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:40,348
Is your home that way?

352
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:14,132
-You never said you'd come over…
-Can't I?

353
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,384
-No, you can--
-I'm coming in.

354
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:18,511
-Pardon me.
-Hey!

355
00:27:22,223 --> 00:27:23,641
What's up with you?

356
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:37,947
Are you cheating on me?

357
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:38,865
What?

358
00:27:39,657 --> 00:27:42,535
Heard you were with a woman
who came to the office today.

359
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:43,745
How do you know her?

360
00:27:44,454 --> 00:27:46,247
Just someone I interviewed once.

361
00:27:47,123 --> 00:27:48,666
For what story?

362
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,960
Can't say. You should know that.

363
00:27:51,961 --> 00:27:55,215
A person you once interviewed
came to the office over and over?

364
00:27:55,298 --> 00:27:56,925
It's not that unusual.

365
00:27:58,259 --> 00:28:00,178
You've got the wrong idea.

366
00:28:00,261 --> 00:28:01,930
Cheer up, okay?

367
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:06,142
Okay?

368
00:29:06,327 --> 00:29:08,371
WILL

369
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:05,970
-Are you going to shower?
-Huh? Okay.

370
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:25,949
R
PLEASE CALL ME

371
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:32,580
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU
PLEASE CALL ME

372
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:36,376
PLEASE ANSWER MY CALLS
I'M AT THE BUNCHO OFFICE

373
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:44,634
I NEED AN EXPLANATION FOR YESTERDAY

374
00:30:45,718 --> 00:30:47,470
I'LL TALK TO YOU LATER
UNDERSTOOD

375
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:49,597
PLEASE GO THROUGH THIS DRAFT

376
00:31:03,903 --> 00:31:10,451
BUNCHO OFFICE

377
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,917
I used to be more gung-ho
when I was younger,

378
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:19,335
but now I'm more relaxed.

379
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:24,048
Rather than do things my own way,
I try to adjust to how my co-stars act.

380
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:26,718
That's what's fun for me now.

381
00:31:27,802 --> 00:31:28,887
I see.

382
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:34,434
There are rumors that you'll be starring
in a major US-Japan joint production

383
00:31:34,517 --> 00:31:36,686
that will be streamed worldwide.

384
00:31:37,478 --> 00:31:41,733
It has always been our chief's desire
for one of Kodama Productions' actors

385
00:31:41,816 --> 00:31:43,776
to star in a foreign production.

386
00:31:44,527 --> 00:31:47,614
I would like to take the first step
as the face of the agency.

387
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:55,580
How did that go?

388
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:58,583
Fine.

389
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:00,919
I have her location.

390
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:03,630
I'll go meet her later.

391
00:32:03,713 --> 00:32:05,131
This is a critical phase.

392
00:32:05,798 --> 00:32:07,634
Failure is not an option.

393
00:32:10,386 --> 00:32:13,014
-Yes, ma'am.
-Do you have any personal goals?

394
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:14,474
Let's see.

395
00:32:15,808 --> 00:32:17,435
The same as my chief.

396
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:20,563
I want to leave a mark
in a foreign production

397
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:23,942
and repay the chief
and my agency for their efforts.

398
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:27,403
That has been my goal for many years now.

399
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:31,741
Thank you for the call.

400
00:32:32,408 --> 00:32:35,578
Are you willing to continue
our conversation from before?

401
00:32:36,537 --> 00:32:37,372
Yes.

402
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:40,750
But I have a condition.

403
00:32:40,833 --> 00:32:41,709
A condition?

404
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:45,880
Mr. Akashi may have been the one
to leak Kuryu's scandal to Weekly Buncho,

405
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:49,342
but the order must have come
from his superior, Ms. Yoko Kodama.

406
00:32:50,009 --> 00:32:52,261
I want you to find evidence to prove that.

407
00:32:54,013 --> 00:32:55,348
I understand.

408
00:32:56,975 --> 00:33:00,103
So the persecution against your agency

409
00:33:00,186 --> 00:33:05,108
is indeed a concentrated effort
orchestrated by Ms. Yoko Kodama then?

410
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:07,318
I believe so.

411
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:10,947
However, one thing doesn't make sense.

412
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:13,658
Doesn't make sense?

413
00:33:13,741 --> 00:33:17,495
It's true that there were
disagreements between us.

414
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:22,917
I can understand her trying to squash me
by leaking Fujiwara's scandal.

415
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:27,255
What I don't get is,
why exactly this timing?

416
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:32,427
Filming had already started
for the JBS drama

417
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:35,054
that Fujiwara and Mr. Aso
were going to co-star in.

418
00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:37,807
Even though we bypassed Ms. Yoko
to get it approved,

419
00:33:38,641 --> 00:33:41,561
a scandal on Fujiwara
coming out at that time

420
00:33:41,644 --> 00:33:45,815
would also greatly affect the work
of Mr. Aso, the face of their agency.

421
00:33:45,898 --> 00:33:48,818
I can't imagine
any agency would want to do that.

422
00:33:49,652 --> 00:33:50,611
Good point.

423
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:56,325
Maybe there was a reason
they had to leak it at that point in time.

424
00:33:58,828 --> 00:34:04,584
Perhaps something that was more important
than just making things harder for me.

425
00:34:05,752 --> 00:34:07,420
I want you to find that out.

426
00:34:14,802 --> 00:34:16,679
Does that ring a bell?

427
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:22,435
One of our reporters
got word of a particular scandal.

428
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:23,853
What?

429
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:28,941
Hey, what the heck? That's mine!

430
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:31,986
Is this informant
the person you met today?

431
00:34:33,446 --> 00:34:34,447
Yeah.

432
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:37,033
That's a huge scoop!
When is it coming out?

433
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:39,410
It isn't.

434
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:40,328
What?

435
00:34:41,537 --> 00:34:43,247
It ended up being fake.

436
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:44,332
Fake?

437
00:34:52,715 --> 00:34:55,093
That reporter said it was a fake story.

438
00:34:55,718 --> 00:34:58,096
But assuming that it was true

439
00:34:58,179 --> 00:35:01,140
and that it was planned
to be published in Weekly Buncho,

440
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:05,186
I would expect Kodama Productions
to make a deal with Buncho over it.

441
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:09,148
You think Fujiwara's scandal
was used as part of that deal?

442
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:13,611
Yes. If that were the case,
it would all make sense.

443
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:17,657
What was that article about?

444
00:35:20,034 --> 00:35:23,663
An allegation about a prominent actor
affiliated with Kodama Productions…

445
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:27,834
sexually assaulting someone.

446
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:32,130
A prominent actor?

447
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:44,058
THAT DAY, I WAS SEXUALLY ASSAULTED
BY HIDETO ASO

448
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:45,560
It's Hideto Aso.

449
00:36:25,391 --> 00:36:28,394
-Sorry. Thanks for the drink.
-I'll see you again.

450
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:35,985
Nice to meet you.

451
00:36:36,068 --> 00:36:37,778
Did you just get off from work?

452
00:36:39,947 --> 00:36:40,948
Here.

453
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:45,286
What?

454
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:46,954
TAKAYUKI AKASHI

455
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:53,961
I would like to talk to you
about our talent, Mr. Hideto Aso.

456
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:29,080
Let us both
make the best of this partnership.

457
00:37:29,163 --> 00:37:30,248
Agreed.

458
00:37:31,207 --> 00:37:32,416
PREVIEW

459
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,501
Is it true?

460
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:37,088
Fujiwara's scandal was leaked
to cover that up?

461
00:37:37,171 --> 00:37:39,215
A SCANDAL HIDDEN BEHIND A SCANDAL

462
00:37:39,298 --> 00:37:40,800
Are you going to expose it?

463
00:37:40,883 --> 00:37:44,553
If we don't do anything about it,
our agency is done for.

464
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:47,348
COVER-UPS AND TRUTHS
OF THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY

465
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:49,225
How much has she found out?

466
00:37:49,308 --> 00:37:50,476
Were you bribed?

467
00:37:51,018 --> 00:37:54,397
Doesn't everyone have some hidden secret?

468
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:57,817
A different side of you
that you can't show to others?

469
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:00,027
We can't afford any mistakes.

470
00:38:00,653 --> 00:38:02,655
Can you agree to a settlement?

471
00:38:02,738 --> 00:38:06,075
We'd prefer to avoid
taking any forceful measures.

472
00:38:06,158 --> 00:38:08,536
WHAT BIG SECRET WILL COME TO LIGHT?

473
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:11,247
I have nothing to say to her.

474
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:12,832
They'll keep pressuring us.

475
00:38:12,915 --> 00:38:14,125
You should stop too.

476
00:38:14,208 --> 00:38:17,586
This case is just the tip of the iceberg.

477
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:20,381
I have something I want you to see.

478
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:23,217
Complaints raised by those
who've been unjustly hurt

479
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:25,803
are being erased
by favoritism and manipulation.

480
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:28,889
THE TRUTH CHANGES INSTANTLY

481
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:30,683
I'm considering backing out.

482
00:38:30,766 --> 00:38:35,646
IOKA ATTEMPTS TO BRING COVERED-UP TRUTHS
TO LIGHT

483
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:39,984
WHO IS THE VICTIM OF THE CASE
THEY DISCOVER?

484
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:45,323
