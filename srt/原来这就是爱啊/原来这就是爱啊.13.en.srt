EPISODE 13

2
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:22,731
Do you want me
to console you or something?

3
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:33,074
Get back inside. You'll look weird
staying out here like this.

4
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:49,799
<i>Our family members were always
scattered and doing their own thing.</i>

5
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:52,664
We don't like to gather together.

6
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:53,845
But…

7
00:00:53,928 --> 00:00:57,015
…after some things happened,

8
00:00:57,098 --> 00:00:59,142
we started gathering together
to drink and sing

9
00:00:59,684 --> 00:01:02,437
when one of us seemed down or depressed.

10
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,982
We feel too awkward
to directly console them.

11
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:08,943
So we just spend time together.

12
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:12,739
So that the person
won't be depressed all alone.

13
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:18,119
And today, it's our mom.

14
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:20,097
Jigu, do you know this song?
Sing this for me.

15
00:01:24,542 --> 00:01:25,822
She doesn't seem like it, right?

16
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:27,212
No.

17
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:30,507
Everyone in this family is like that.

18
00:01:31,007 --> 00:01:32,008
They don't show anything.

19
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:37,972
The girl you're seeing
is kind of like that too.

20
00:01:40,683 --> 00:01:44,395
So in a way, you fit right in.

21
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:46,981
I don't know how to say it…

22
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:50,652
…but you seem like
a good match with our family.

23
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:15,337
Why aren't you singing?

24
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:17,762
I don't know which song to pick.

25
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:19,782
CALL IT LOVE

26
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:27,623
Well…

27
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:30,710
I'm sorry to just show up
unannounced every time.

28
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:33,922
You don't have to be sorry
about small things like this.

29
00:03:34,672 --> 00:03:36,007
Actually, I enjoyed it.

30
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:41,346
If you are free tomorrow evening,
please join us for dinner.

31
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:42,513
I really mean it.

32
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:46,434
He's busy with work.
He has a business trip, too.

33
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:48,338
I just want to see him some more.

34
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:52,262
When do I get to see you again?

35
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,673
I'll come to visit you in Tongyeong.

36
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,362
Okay, please do.

37
00:03:58,488 --> 00:03:59,989
Yes, I'll be leaving now.

38
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:03,534
See you later.

39
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:06,204
- Have a good night.
- Bye.

40
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:35,857
Huh?

41
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:44,701
Who made all this food?

42
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:56,546
Mmm.

43
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:40,757
<i>I forgot to give you your bag.</i>

44
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:42,842
<i>If you haven't gone too far, wait for me.</i>

45
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:44,635
No, don't bother.

46
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:45,762
<i>I'll come to you.</i>

47
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:52,727
I'll be back soon.

48
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:54,490
Why would you see him again? Just go home.

49
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,481
I won't be long. You go ahead.

50
00:05:58,149 --> 00:06:00,068
Gosh, that nutjob.

51
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:13,998
Just look at the time, huh?

52
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:16,145
It's really quite dangerous at night.

53
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:19,295
If it's something that ordinary,
I'll also just let it slide.

54
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:21,297
But…

55
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,716
I'm sensing something else.

56
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,530
I don't know what you're talking about.

57
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:30,555
Let's just go.

58
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:37,939
Is there a problem with Mr. Han Dongjin?

59
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:44,445
How serious is it?

60
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,240
Huh?

61
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:57,834
<i>I thought I told you.</i>

62
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:00,711
<i>I don't want to extend my contract.</i>

63
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:05,091
<i>No, don't bother. I'll come to you.</i>

64
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:15,226
I could have come to you.

65
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:19,397
My family is waiting, so I'll be going.

66
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:20,522
Get home safely.

67
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:22,900
Could you hear me out for a second?

68
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:28,072
I know what you're going to say.

69
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:35,329
A part-timer quitting work
isn't a big deal.

70
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:38,182
So please don't worry about it anymore.

71
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:41,335
You don't have to be so worried about me.

72
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:45,923
The bag was just an excuse.

73
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:48,634
I went there because I missed you.

74
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:53,681
I wanted to see you.

75
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:57,143
I thought it would make me feel calm.

76
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:11,574
<i>Was he married before?</i>

77
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:14,619
Or does he have a child?

78
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:17,205
No.

79
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:21,501
What, so does he have debt?

80
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:24,879
How much then?
Is it over a hundred million won?

81
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,180
Haesung.

82
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,279
Don't call me like that.
You're scaring me.

83
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,021
Sit down, okay?

84
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:43,856
Let's sit down and talk.

85
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:51,656
The way you're so calm means
that it's something big, isn't it?

86
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:57,161
Tell me. What is it?

87
00:08:58,287 --> 00:09:00,331
Why do you two seem so tense?

88
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:06,003
I can't talk about it.

89
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:12,593
I don't even know where to begin or how.

90
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:30,318
Hey.

91
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,895
<i>She wants you here right now.</i>

92
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,651
<i>She says she'll call Mr. Han Dongjin
if you don't show up.</i>

93
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:43,613
<i>I don't think she'll back down.</i>

94
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:45,793
<i>So just come here.
And we'll deal with this together.</i>

95
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:06,564
<i>Haesung, do you know who this is?</i>

96
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:08,858
Mr. Han. Get up.

97
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:10,276
We need to talk.

98
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:15,281
Even if you end up breaking up,
at least try dating him.

99
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:16,490
There's no harm in trying.

100
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:17,991
No way.

101
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:21,078
It won't happen,
not even over my dead body.

102
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:22,972
<i>I think I'm going to regret it.</i>

103
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:25,708
I know I'll regret it.

104
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:28,836
<i>But I want to be here right now.</i>

105
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:31,881
<i>I want to be with him.</i>

106
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:00,533
Hey, what are you doing?

107
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:05,164
He's married, isn't he?

108
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:11,212
It can't happen even over your dead body.

109
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,871
And you want to be with him
even though you'd regret it.

110
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:17,468
That can only mean he's married, right?

111
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:20,680
You've gone and done
that despicable thing!

112
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:24,225
Sim Woojoo.

113
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:27,520
You know that
this simply can't happen in our family.

114
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:33,401
When others spout nonsense
such as, "It's not an affair, it's love,"

115
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:36,070
we're supposed to say,

116
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:39,949
"You're just terrible people
who drive stakes through others' hearts."

117
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:42,410
Because we saw what Mom had to go through.

118
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:48,749
And that's why, for me…

119
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:53,838
…I feel more miserable now
than when Dad had an affair.

120
00:11:56,006 --> 00:11:57,925
So miserable that I want to kill myself!

121
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:03,304
I'm sorry.

122
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:06,927
Did you even think about Mom
when you were seeing him?

123
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:09,528
Did you even think about our family?

124
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:17,027
Haesung.

125
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:19,655
He's not married.

126
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:23,659
That's not what this is.

127
00:12:33,627 --> 00:12:35,004
That guy, Han Dongjin…

128
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:38,044
He's the son of that woman.

129
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:42,857
The one your dad cheated on your mom with.

130
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:48,559
What?

131
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:51,103
She got the job
at that company to take revenge.

132
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:54,590
But things turned out differently.

133
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:12,499
You…

134
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:16,420
Jun, you knew this all along and…

135
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:27,890
What an admirable friendship.

136
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:30,601
It's impressive.

137
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:34,980
It's so deeply moving, really! Huh?

138
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:41,529
I'm sorry, Haesung.

139
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:44,740
It's all my fault.

140
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:29,469
Haesung.

141
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:32,765
Haesung, let me talk to you.

142
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,437
Where are you going?

143
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:44,276
You and Woojoo are both lunatics!

144
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:47,363
Does this make any sense to you?
This has to be a joke.

145
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:48,947
And…

146
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:52,868
to think I said all those things
to that woman's son…

147
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:58,207
- I'll explain. Let's head inside.
- Explain what?

148
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,125
What can you possibly explain?

149
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:06,840
I'm really sorry,

150
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:09,468
but I was going
to keep it a secret until the end.

151
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:12,513
I felt bad for Woojoo.

152
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:20,604
I've felt sorry for her since we were 17.

153
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:23,774
When she jumped onto her dad's car

154
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,902
and when she gave up on college
to work and make money.

155
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:30,706
<i>It broke my heart to see her
living such an aloof and stoic life.</i>

156
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:33,867
<i>So when she finally found
someone she liked,</i>

157
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:37,371
<i>I pretended to believe her
when she said she'd end it.</i>

158
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:40,582
<i>It was probably tougher on her,
so what could I do?</i>

159
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,503
Now that you know about it,

160
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:46,672
she'll take care of it and end it.

161
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:50,718
She wouldn't continue things
at the cost of hurting her family.

162
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:51,885
You know this too, Haesung.

163
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:55,431
What a load of bullcrap.

164
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,708
ZUCCHINI, BEAN SPROUTS, POTATO

165
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:42,853
What are you doing?

166
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:48,816
I see.

167
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:52,780
You're planning to make food
for Dongjin, right?

168
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,914
You've only met him twice,
isn't that too soon?

169
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:59,203
I need a reason
to see him for the third time.

170
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,705
- So we can get closer.
- Hmm…

171
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:05,375
So my sisters take after you.

172
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:07,294
So driven.

173
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:09,838
What dishes does he like?

174
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:12,007
Dongjin?

175
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:14,510
He likes meat. Make him some meat dishes.

176
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:15,761
Like braised beef?

177
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:16,845
Yes, that works.

178
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:30,109
SHIITAKE MUSHROOM, ANCHOVY,
BRAISED BEEF

179
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:40,202
What does she do for a living?

180
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:46,625
You wouldn't buy this stuff.
Someone prepared it for you.

181
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:50,462
What does she do?

182
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:55,467
I'm going on a business trip tomorrow.
I won't be back for a week.

183
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:58,720
Have a good trip.

184
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:06,478
What? Are you afraid
I'll just settle down here?

185
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:08,313
Well, don't worry.

186
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:10,277
Because we've lived apart
since you were little,

187
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:12,651
I feel uncomfortable living here too.

188
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:14,361
I'm going to leave!

189
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:48,604
Have you set a date for the move?

190
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:49,730
Not yet.

191
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:53,525
I'll pack a few things
and move in with my parents.

192
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:59,031
They caught me living recklessly.
It's for the better anyway.

193
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:03,327
The fair's starting soon, right?

194
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,203
Yes.

195
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:06,580
You must be so busy.

196
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:09,124
Why did you stop by here?

197
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:16,548
I used work as an excuse

198
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:18,832
not to pay enough attention
to what my mother was doing.

199
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:21,428
It must have been very hard for you.

200
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:24,443
I'm sorry for not picking up on it sooner.

201
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:26,892
It's late, but I apologize.

202
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:32,898
I should have told you everything sooner.

203
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:37,945
Your words make me feel better instantly.

204
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:43,157
I apologize too.

205
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:47,454
About the wedding invitation
my mom sent you.

206
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:51,369
It might sound like an excuse,
but I found out later.

207
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:54,419
I always felt horrible,

208
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:57,234
thinking about how much you'd hate me

209
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,240
and how terrible I must seem to you.

210
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:06,515
Don't feel like that anymore.
It's okay now.

211
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,434
I'm relieved.

212
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:12,688
You're with someone nice.

213
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:20,070
Let me know how much it is.

214
00:21:21,321 --> 00:21:22,364
I'll pay you back.

215
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:24,241
Will you pay me back
even if I say it's okay?

216
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:25,992
Yes.

217
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:27,410
Okay.

218
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:29,570
But don't rush to pay me back.

219
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:35,460
Thanks.

220
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:06,742
<i>Haesung, just give me two days.</i>

221
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:15,167
I'll quit the job in two days
and end everything.

222
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:17,335
I promise.

223
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:20,755
Today.

224
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:22,966
Quit the job today.

225
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:35,937
Or do as you wish.

226
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:38,607
I'll do as I please too.

227
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:40,984
Haesung…

228
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:49,427
<i>I'd like to mark the booths
early tomorrow morning.</i>

229
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:50,577
<i>Is that possible?</i>

230
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:52,829
Yes, we can contact
a local business in Gangwon-do

231
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,664
and move up the schedule.

232
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:56,475
Is it because of Hojin Trading Company?

233
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:59,503
We can't expedite the electrical work.
Are they okay with that?

234
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:02,714
We've decided to just place
the materials at the booths for now.

235
00:23:04,257 --> 00:23:07,636
Then, I'll head out first
with the planning team.

236
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:10,472
I guess you'll have to leave tonight
instead of tomorrow.

237
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:12,235
We should both be present for the marking.

238
00:23:13,016 --> 00:23:14,016
We should.

239
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:19,106
Gosh, the office stuff alone
must be quite a lot.

240
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:20,941
Woojoo is packing them in advance.

241
00:23:21,024 --> 00:23:23,860
What does a part-timer know?
You should have just let Ms. Kim do it.

242
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:43,880
- Should we have a lunch break?
- Yes.

243
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:46,383
This goes here and…

244
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:48,759
Mmm!

245
00:23:51,304 --> 00:23:52,973
I wanted to buy you something delicious.

246
00:23:54,015 --> 00:23:55,015
This is delicious.

247
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:57,399
Why do you want to buy her
something delicious?

248
00:23:58,895 --> 00:24:00,021
I'm quitting.

249
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:02,774
What?

250
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:06,570
Let's get together to eat
when we're done with the fair.

251
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,405
You've worked so hard.

252
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:11,324
It wouldn't sit right with me…

253
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:13,088
…if I sent you off
without doing something.

254
00:24:14,494 --> 00:24:16,246
Ms. Sim, did you break up with Mr. Han?

255
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:18,165
Yuri.

256
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:20,959
No, what I mean is…

257
00:24:21,918 --> 00:24:26,798
I was kind of looking forward
to having Ms. Sim as my junior coworker.

258
00:24:28,216 --> 00:24:30,343
You're not the most friendly person,

259
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:32,929
but you're good at your job.

260
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,433
And now that you say that you're quitting,
I'm just taken off guard.

261
00:24:40,395 --> 00:24:41,688
Hurry up and eat.

262
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:47,486
Thank you for everything, Ms. Baek.

263
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:52,032
I always thought you were really cool.

264
00:24:52,699 --> 00:24:54,075
I really mean that.

265
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:56,536
Please take my calls.

266
00:24:57,662 --> 00:24:59,382
Don't mark me as spam
just because you quit.

267
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:21,790
Check this for one last time.

268
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:23,354
Yes, sir.

269
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:35,367
Tell him that I packed small amounts
because I didn't know how much he'd eat.

270
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:37,587
And that he should
come back for more later.

271
00:25:38,286 --> 00:25:39,788
Gosh, who would think this is little?

272
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:41,706
People would think
you emptied out a grocery.

273
00:25:42,415 --> 00:25:45,255
Also, tell him to add more seasoning
if my cooking is too bland for him.

274
00:25:50,006 --> 00:25:51,633
My gosh, Madam Kim. Stop.

275
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:53,301
Put away the kimchi container.

276
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:54,386
Why?

277
00:25:54,469 --> 00:25:57,514
Your son doesn't have a car
and can't carry all that on foot.

278
00:25:57,597 --> 00:25:58,597
Well…

279
00:25:59,015 --> 00:26:00,684
Then let me just pack some fresh kimchi.

280
00:26:00,767 --> 00:26:02,060
Just a little bit.

281
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:05,438
Okay, as you wish.

282
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:07,202
It's only your son's arms
that will suffer.

283
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:17,784
Gosh. Wait a minute.

284
00:26:36,344 --> 00:26:37,971
<i>First floor.</i>

285
00:26:41,182 --> 00:26:43,101
Oh. Hello, ma'am.

286
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:45,270
Huh? Me?

287
00:26:45,353 --> 00:26:46,353
Yes.

288
00:26:46,521 --> 00:26:50,609
I'm an acquaintance of Dongjin,
and I'm on my way to his place right now.

289
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,820
Ma'am, I saw you in the photo.

290
00:26:53,903 --> 00:26:55,864
Oh, okay. Nice to meet you.

291
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:58,241
Yes, nice to meet you too.
My name is Sim Jigu.

292
00:26:58,325 --> 00:27:00,910
Uh, Dongjin isn't home right now
because he's at work.

293
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:03,496
I know, so I'll just
leave these by his door.

294
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:07,250
These are side dishes made by my mother,
and she's a really good cook.

295
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:08,614
So she packed some food for him.

296
00:27:08,668 --> 00:27:11,338
Then please put them in the fridge.

297
00:27:11,421 --> 00:27:13,340
- Yes, ma'am.
- Would you like the door code?

298
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:14,924
No, I know it.

299
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:17,510
Then I'll leave you to it. Okay.

300
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:18,594
Yes, ma'am.

301
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:29,692
- To Yeonhui-dong, please.
- Yes, ma'am.

302
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:42,369
What a nice house.

303
00:27:43,703 --> 00:27:45,872
Nice, nice, nice.

304
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,056
Take a look.

305
00:28:03,139 --> 00:28:05,016
Didn't I tell you
the front yard is wonderful?

306
00:28:05,308 --> 00:28:06,851
Hmm. It's pretty nice.

307
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:09,312
The inside is even nicer.

308
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:12,115
- Okay, let's head inside.
- Let's go.

309
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:20,907
Thank you. I'll give you a call.

310
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:21,990
Okay.

311
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:28,164
GOLDEN COUNTRY REALTY

312
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:32,001
Darn it.

313
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,546
JUNIOR

314
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:36,422
How did it go?

315
00:28:36,464 --> 00:28:39,092
<i>Gosh, you were right, Namil.</i>

316
00:28:39,175 --> 00:28:40,927
As soon as you left that house,

317
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:42,762
she went to every single realtor

318
00:28:42,846 --> 00:28:44,848
in the neighborhood
and put the house up for sale.

319
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:46,182
My goodness.

320
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:48,970
I told you she'd be quick.
She doesn't waste any time.

321
00:28:49,477 --> 00:28:52,188
And the house has finally been sold.

322
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:56,627
<i>She did put the house
for cheaper than the market value,</i>

323
00:28:56,943 --> 00:28:59,863
<i>and since the house is so nice,
they signed the contract right away.</i>

324
00:28:59,946 --> 00:29:02,198
Deposit to this account, please.

325
00:29:03,491 --> 00:29:06,531
You're getting a great deal
considering the current market value.

326
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:09,497
<i>What will you do now?</i>

327
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:12,208
I'll take care of the rest,
so step back for now.

HEEJA'S CALL ABOUT THE WILL

330
00:29:25,221 --> 00:29:29,017
<i>This is outrageous!
The will doesn't mention my name anywhere!</i>

331
00:29:29,517 --> 00:29:32,270
<i>I've done more than enough
for him as a wife,</i>

332
00:29:32,353 --> 00:29:34,439
<i>and he couldn't bother
to even leave me a penny!</i>

333
00:29:35,231 --> 00:29:36,471
Even the house in Yeonhui-dong?

334
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:40,904
The only asset he has left is that house,
and even that is left to his kids.

335
00:29:42,405 --> 00:29:43,782
Darn, I'm so mad right now.

336
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:48,328
What would have happened
if I hadn't found this?

337
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:50,789
So what will you do now?

338
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:53,082
<i>I'm going to keep this hidden</i>

339
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:55,293
and wait till he dies.

340
00:29:55,376 --> 00:29:57,712
Is the guardian
of patient Sim Chulmin here?

341
00:29:57,796 --> 00:29:59,422
Hey, I'll talk to you later.

342
00:29:59,506 --> 00:30:00,924

353
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:40,463
It's all my fault.

354
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:46,552
Jihyung.

355
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:48,011
Hmm?

356
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:52,767
I've been taking medicine
for a panic disorder.

357
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:57,605
Ever since that woman
grabbed my hair and made a scene.

358
00:30:59,482 --> 00:31:00,525
I see.

359
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:02,277
I understand.

360
00:31:04,445 --> 00:31:05,925
This really isn't that big of a deal.

361
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:09,742
It's something I can casually share

362
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:11,995
with my coworkers and friends.

363
00:31:14,664 --> 00:31:17,458
So I don't know why it's so difficult
to tell my family about it.

364
00:31:18,751 --> 00:31:20,587
Yes. It's hard.

365
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:26,843
Maybe it's because you know
they'd worry about you more than yourself.

366
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,040
And it would be tough for you
to see your family like that.

367
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:35,268
I guess so.

368
00:31:37,186 --> 00:31:39,355
But you should tell them
what needs to be said.

369
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:43,192
My parents found out about me
getting scammed long after it happened.

370
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:45,445
And my mom couldn't eat for three days.

371
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:47,906
She said she was hurt,

372
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:50,742
and that she felt like
an unreliable mother.

373
00:31:51,492 --> 00:31:52,869
That really caught me off guard.

374
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:56,456
Cheer up.

375
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:42,001
Hey.

376
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:54,389
What?

377
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:56,391
Do you have something to say?

378
00:32:58,059 --> 00:32:59,143
Mmm.

379
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:02,480
Did something happen
between you and Ms. Sim Woojoo?

380
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:10,113
Why? Did she say something?

381
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:18,245
You know…

382
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:22,333
With all the preparations for
the camping fair and the overseas fairs,

383
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:23,876
things have been hectic.

384
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:26,379
What could possibly happen
between the CEO and a part-timer?

385
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:30,425
Can you stop calling her a part-timer?

386
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:34,595
She has a name. Call her by her name.

387
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:38,641
Okay, Sim Woojoo.

388
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:39,725
Is that better?

389
00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:50,361
I thought you were going to Ilsan.
Don't you have to go?

390
00:33:52,905 --> 00:33:54,615
Well, I'll go first.

391
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:59,162
Take care driving at night,
and call me when you're about to leave.

392
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:41,037
Right.

393
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,289
Did you pack the pamphlets
with the fair map

394
00:34:43,372 --> 00:34:44,692
that were delivered this morning?

395
00:34:44,999 --> 00:34:47,418
They're inside the yellow box in there.
I've marked them.

396
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:49,003
So you did pack them.

397
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:50,921
So…

398
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:55,218
Thank you for the good work thus far.

399
00:35:29,168 --> 00:35:30,878
How long do you think it'll take us?

400
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:32,213
There's no traffic,

401
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:34,176
so we'll be there
in about two and a half hours.

402
00:35:34,715 --> 00:35:37,135
I'm sorry, but please wake me up
when we arrive.

403
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:38,218
Yes, sir.

404
00:36:26,392 --> 00:36:27,768
The van just left.

405
00:36:29,103 --> 00:36:31,272
I know. I wanted to talk to you,
so I waited.

406
00:36:33,482 --> 00:36:35,735
I can be back at the office
by seven o'clock.

407
00:36:35,818 --> 00:36:38,362
Please wait until then.
I'll come to get you.

408
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:43,141
Don't take these and go home alone.

409
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:47,455
I'll see you later.

410
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:21,030
Why are you home already?
Are you done for the day?

411
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:44,762
I didn't say I was thirsty.

412
00:37:45,304 --> 00:37:46,555
What are you about to tell me?

413
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:51,686
Drink this whole thing,
and then I'll tell you.

414
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,524
Drink, it's lukewarm water.

415
00:37:59,485 --> 00:38:00,565
Okay, have a good day.

416
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:03,614
JUN PHARMACY

417
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:05,365
Hi.

418
00:38:05,908 --> 00:38:06,993
Hey.

419
00:38:07,076 --> 00:38:09,412
- Going to the practice room?
- No. I can't today.

420
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:10,895
I'm taking Mom to the bus terminal.

421
00:38:11,872 --> 00:38:13,624
Oh, thank you.

422
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:19,154
- Could I have a <i>cheongsimhwan?</i>
<i>- Cheongsimhwan?</i>

423
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:22,258
<i>Cheongsimhwan…</i>

424
00:38:22,341 --> 00:38:23,801
Why do you need it all of a sudden?

425
00:38:23,884 --> 00:38:26,887
I don't know. Haesung told me to get it.
She'll pay for it too.

426
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:28,889
Where is she right now?

427
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:30,850
Home. She told me to come home too.

428
00:38:52,621 --> 00:38:56,500
After your divorce and you got sick,

429
00:38:58,336 --> 00:39:00,212
things that were
most difficult for me were…

430
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:03,799
…you not picking up your phone,

431
00:39:05,051 --> 00:39:09,805
or Woojoo or Jigu calling me
at work out of the blue.

432
00:39:11,807 --> 00:39:13,392
"Why are they calling me at this hour?"

433
00:39:14,935 --> 00:39:16,771
"Did something happen again at home?"

434
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:20,566
Each time,

435
00:39:22,234 --> 00:39:24,111
my heart would beat really fast,

436
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:26,196
and it was difficult.

437
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:30,284
I'm still like that.

438
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:34,955
My heart sinks
when Jigu suddenly calls me.

439
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:41,128
I think that's why I had such a hard time

440
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:45,216
telling you about how we lost the house.

441
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:50,471
"When should I call Mom

442
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:54,447
so that she wouldn't be in such a shock?"

443
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:01,070
I'd mull it over
and then lose the opportunity.

444
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:02,983
Again and again…

445
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:12,826
I know.

446
00:40:13,285 --> 00:40:15,079
I understand what you kids
have gone through.

447
00:40:24,713 --> 00:40:25,923
Yesterday…

448
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:28,426
I hit Woojoo.

449
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:30,761
I wanted it to hurt.

450
00:40:33,347 --> 00:40:34,849
So I hit her with all my strength.

451
00:40:37,226 --> 00:40:38,310
She didn't even squeak.

452
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:42,022
She's a former athlete,
and she just let me hit her.

453
00:40:51,407 --> 00:40:54,618
Mom, what do we do about Woojoo?

454
00:41:00,666 --> 00:41:02,084
Han Dongjin…

455
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:06,046
Han Dongjin, that guy…

456
00:41:10,676 --> 00:41:12,011
He's that woman's son.

457
00:41:18,517 --> 00:41:19,643
The man

458
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:24,148
our Woojoo loves so much is…

459
00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:30,029
He's the son of that woman.

460
00:41:31,614 --> 00:41:32,614
Who?

461
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:35,617
Whose son?

462
00:41:39,455 --> 00:41:42,625
The woman who took our house.

463
00:41:45,461 --> 00:41:46,461
Heeja?

464
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:50,883
Yes.

465
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:58,182
Yes, that's right. It's Dongjin.

466
00:41:58,682 --> 00:41:59,767
We're living together.

467
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:01,310
You crazy idiot!

468
00:42:01,393 --> 00:42:02,311
Are you insane?

469
00:42:02,394 --> 00:42:03,562
I know everything.

470
00:42:04,146 --> 00:42:06,690
I know what kind of relationship
Dongjin's mom and our mom have.

471
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:07,934
Didn't you already know this?

472
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:14,240
Darn it. I can't believe this.

473
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,077
This isn't right.

474
00:42:19,161 --> 00:42:20,161
Huh?

475
00:42:22,248 --> 00:42:23,707
You know this is messed up.

476
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:25,584
Be quiet and sit down.

477
00:42:30,422 --> 00:42:32,258
Woojoo knew all along.

478
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:35,177
Back when I was staying at his house.

479
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:38,013
No, way before that, she already knew.

480
00:42:38,097 --> 00:42:39,807
She knew and still dated him!

481
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:42,935
We don't need you
freaking out as well, so just stay quiet!

482
00:42:43,018 --> 00:42:45,354
I just went over there and met that woman.

483
00:42:46,146 --> 00:42:49,567
I even bowed to that woman like a fool!

484
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:53,988
I lowered my head to her
when I should have just ignored her!

485
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:55,322
So what?

486
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:58,367
Then go back and take your greeting back!

487
00:43:00,953 --> 00:43:02,121
Are you kidding me right now?

488
00:43:02,204 --> 00:43:03,747
Both of you, just stop!

489
00:43:09,378 --> 00:43:10,378
Mom…

490
00:43:10,963 --> 00:43:12,006
Mom, have a <i>cheongsimhwan</i>.

491
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:17,134
Please take it.

492
00:43:17,803 --> 00:43:19,763
We can't have you faint from this.

493
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:22,891
Okay, Mom?

494
00:43:37,406 --> 00:43:38,407
Does he know?

495
00:43:41,368 --> 00:43:42,536
Did he meet her knowing this?

496
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:45,623
No, he didn't.

497
00:43:47,333 --> 00:43:48,626
I don't think he knows.

498
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:56,812
<i>Haesung is home right now.</i>

499
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:58,760
Yes.

500
00:43:59,845 --> 00:44:01,138
<i>Don't hate her.</i>

501
00:44:01,221 --> 00:44:03,349
<i>It must've been hard for her
to come to that decision.</i>

502
00:44:03,432 --> 00:44:04,683
I don't hate her.

503
00:44:07,144 --> 00:44:08,424
<i>Okay, I'll see you at home.</i>

504
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:36,382
SIM WOOJOO

505
00:45:31,645 --> 00:45:33,439
I'm Han Dongjin from Best Fairs.

506
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:42,531
I thought I recognized you from the back.

507
00:45:43,115 --> 00:45:44,115
Hi, how are you?

508
00:45:44,366 --> 00:45:46,261
You could have just gotten the notes.

509
00:45:46,285 --> 00:45:47,965
Why come here when you have a fair to run?

510
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:49,705
You sure work hard.

511
00:45:50,998 --> 00:45:53,083
If you have that much time,
let's get some tea.

512
00:45:53,709 --> 00:45:54,710
Sure, let's do that.

513
00:45:57,921 --> 00:46:01,049
<i>It's an organizational
fair, so the budget is kind of tight,</i>

514
00:46:01,133 --> 00:46:03,761
but they can be helpful
for overseas fairs,

515
00:46:04,219 --> 00:46:07,014
so even new companies
are jumping on the bid.

516
00:46:08,015 --> 00:46:11,101
I guess it won't be easy.
The bidding competition must be tough too.

517
00:46:11,643 --> 00:46:12,643
Quit whining.

518
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:15,564
Best Fairs is regarded
as a veteran-level company around here.

519
00:46:15,981 --> 00:46:17,274
You know you'll crush it.

520
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:20,050
You received the invitation, right?

521
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:23,989
Yes. I'm going to take my team
and head over there on opening day.

522
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:28,035
I might as well collect some intelligence
on how an outdoor camping fair is run.

523
00:46:29,703 --> 00:46:31,663
By the way, that man…

524
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:33,499
Isn't that CEO Choi Sunwoo?

525
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:37,711
It is him.

526
00:46:40,589 --> 00:46:42,257
<i>The employees are all there.</i>

527
00:46:42,841 --> 00:46:44,218
I just got a call from them.

528
00:46:46,136 --> 00:46:47,136
I mean…

529
00:46:49,556 --> 00:46:50,556
I thought

530
00:46:51,558 --> 00:46:53,018
I had to talk to you,

531
00:46:53,602 --> 00:46:55,020
so I came all this way.

532
00:46:56,814 --> 00:46:57,814
But this is…

533
00:46:58,565 --> 00:47:02,152
I don't know if it's for your sake,
or I just don't want to be blamed later.

534
00:47:02,778 --> 00:47:03,904
It's confusing.

535
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:07,241
Just tell me.

536
00:47:08,534 --> 00:47:10,619
Once you tell me,
it's all my responsibility.

537
00:47:11,870 --> 00:47:13,539
Whether I suffer or endure it…

538
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:17,584
I'll deal with it myself.

539
00:47:19,169 --> 00:47:21,004
So if it's something
I should know, tell me.

540
00:47:21,964 --> 00:47:25,008
It's about Ms. Sim Woojoo.

541
00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:34,810
<i>Cha Youngmin came by the office.</i>

542
00:47:35,435 --> 00:47:36,728
<i>He was asking to be rehired.</i>

543
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:40,232
<i>In the midst of talking,</i>

544
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,902
<i>he asked why Ms. Sim can be
given a chance and he can't.</i>

545
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:48,240
He said that she helped him.
I didn't believe it either.

546
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:49,740
But…

547
00:47:50,993 --> 00:47:53,353
he was dead serious about it,
and it was kind of concerning.

548
00:47:55,247 --> 00:47:57,666
<i>According to him, she came to him…</i>

549
00:47:59,585 --> 00:48:01,253
<i>and told him of her own accord.</i>

550
00:48:04,214 --> 00:48:05,465
<i>What did she tell him?</i>

551
00:48:07,092 --> 00:48:08,218
<i>What did she tell him?</i>

552
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:13,307
"You've been caught for being the spy."

553
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:16,143
"Han Dongjin knows all about it."

554
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:21,773
"So if you want to ruin
this company, then try harder."

555
00:48:21,982 --> 00:48:26,153
So if you really want to ruin
this company, then try harder.

556
00:48:27,863 --> 00:48:30,240
I asked her straight up.

557
00:48:30,324 --> 00:48:33,702
I asked if she'd ever said that
to Cha Youngmin.

558
00:48:37,789 --> 00:48:38,957
She said she had.

559
00:48:39,875 --> 00:48:41,084
She admitted it outright.

560
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:57,225
Did you ask her why she did that?

561
00:48:58,185 --> 00:48:59,394
I did ask her.

562
00:49:00,646 --> 00:49:01,688
She wouldn't tell me.

563
00:49:02,981 --> 00:49:04,181
She just asked me for a favor.

564
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:07,444
She said that she'll tell you herself

565
00:49:08,111 --> 00:49:10,238
after the fair is over.

566
00:49:10,906 --> 00:49:14,785
She asked for more time saying
that's the only way you'd be hurt less.

567
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:19,498
But what would she know
when she's the one inflicting the pain?

568
00:49:19,873 --> 00:49:21,375
<i>Pain is all the same.</i>

569
00:49:22,042 --> 00:49:23,802
<i>There's no such thing
as one that hurts less.</i>

570
00:50:01,748 --> 00:50:02,874
Wait inside.

571
00:50:11,967 --> 00:50:12,967
I was

572
00:50:13,969 --> 00:50:14,969
being careless.

573
00:50:16,388 --> 00:50:17,389
Please don't be mad.

574
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:21,601
Haesung.

575
00:50:24,104 --> 00:50:25,689
You said you still wouldn't tell me…

576
00:50:28,275 --> 00:50:29,818
even if it happened again.

577
00:50:31,445 --> 00:50:32,445
You're right.

578
00:50:33,822 --> 00:50:34,823
You wouldn't tell me.

579
00:50:36,491 --> 00:50:39,453
That's your loyalty toward Woojoo.

580
00:50:41,788 --> 00:50:42,788
I do understand.

581
00:50:43,415 --> 00:50:44,415
But…

582
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:49,879
It just…

583
00:50:51,798 --> 00:50:53,300
hurts a lot.

584
00:50:54,593 --> 00:50:55,635
So…

585
00:50:58,638 --> 00:51:00,307
I'm no longer going to like you.

586
00:51:02,809 --> 00:51:04,061
Don't talk to me anymore.

587
00:51:08,065 --> 00:51:09,149
Let's just be…

588
00:51:11,026 --> 00:51:12,026
how we were before.

589
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:34,132
<i>I heard you met Heeja's son.</i>

590
00:51:34,216 --> 00:51:36,760
But he was still looking for us.

591
00:51:37,427 --> 00:51:38,887
To apologize to us.

592
00:51:39,638 --> 00:51:41,556
I also told him that it wasn't his fault.

593
00:51:44,309 --> 00:51:46,853
Just like how we suffered because of Dad,

594
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:49,939
he seemed like

595
00:51:50,524 --> 00:51:53,235
he suffered a lot because of his mom.

596
00:51:54,277 --> 00:51:55,904
<i>So I forgave him.</i>

597
00:51:57,114 --> 00:51:59,133
<i>The number you dialed is turned off.</i>

598
00:51:59,157 --> 00:52:02,119
<i>Please record your message after the beep…</i>

599
00:52:02,577 --> 00:52:05,247
<i>The number you dialed is turned off…</i>

600
00:52:16,049 --> 00:52:17,049
She's not answering.

601
00:52:19,344 --> 00:52:20,846
Her phone's been turned off all day.

602
00:52:21,847 --> 00:52:22,847
Call…

603
00:52:26,101 --> 00:52:27,101
Call him.

604
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:28,937
Ask him if he's with her.

605
00:52:29,521 --> 00:52:30,647
What if he says he is?

606
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:33,567
Tell him everything?

607
00:52:38,947 --> 00:52:41,116
<i>The number you dialed is turned off.</i>

608
00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:43,910
<i>Please record your message after the...</i>

609
00:54:20,257 --> 00:54:22,342
<i>Dongjin knows everything.</i>

610
00:54:23,343 --> 00:54:25,720
DONGJIN KNOWS EVERYTHING.

611
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:53,956
Where are you?

612
00:54:58,044 --> 00:55:01,047
Why did you turn off your phone?
I told you to wait for me at the office.

613
00:55:08,388 --> 00:55:09,389
Where are you?

614
00:55:12,058 --> 00:55:13,476
You heard everything.

615
00:55:14,811 --> 00:55:16,331
You should be asking about that first.

616
00:55:18,565 --> 00:55:20,150
<i>I warned you.</i>

617
00:55:21,067 --> 00:55:22,569
I'm evil and selfish.

618
00:55:24,821 --> 00:55:28,241
I blatantly lied to you
and manipulated you.

619
00:55:28,325 --> 00:55:29,826
<i>I know you're not like that.</i>

620
00:55:32,996 --> 00:55:36,249
I know you're not that type of person.

621
00:55:38,084 --> 00:55:40,124
<i>It was back
when Mr. Cha was still with us,</i>

622
00:55:40,378 --> 00:55:42,058
<i>and we weren't seeing
each other like this.</i>

623
00:55:42,839 --> 00:55:44,674
<i>It wasn't something major
that you lied about.</i>

624
00:55:46,676 --> 00:55:47,969
And I'm okay with it.

625
00:55:49,387 --> 00:55:53,183
<i>So it's all good. Nothing changes.</i>

626
00:55:54,934 --> 00:55:56,227
Let's meet up.

627
00:55:57,395 --> 00:55:58,730
Let's talk in person.

628
00:56:59,165 --> 00:57:01,376
This was my home.

629
00:57:03,753 --> 00:57:06,506
I lived here for over 20 years.

630
00:57:07,757 --> 00:57:10,051
All the happiness,

631
00:57:10,677 --> 00:57:11,803
sorrow,

632
00:57:12,887 --> 00:57:13,972
and pain from my life…

633
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:17,934
They're all in that house.

634
00:57:21,896 --> 00:57:25,400
And someone took that house from us.

635
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:30,397
<i>I've lived there for 20 years,
and I got kicked out of there in 2 days.</i>

636
00:57:31,614 --> 00:57:33,032
<i>What about this house?</i>

637
00:57:33,116 --> 00:57:35,452
<i>How many times do I have
to tell you this house is mine?</i>

638
00:57:35,535 --> 00:57:40,081
The deed of our house got transferred
to a total stranger overnight.

639
00:57:40,206 --> 00:57:42,435
<i>What happened to the people
who were living here before?</i>

640
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:45,146
<i>How would I know the phone
numbers of the kids I kicked out?</i>

641
00:57:45,170 --> 00:57:46,546
<i>You look well.</i>

642
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:49,674
Like someone
who's forgotten all about the past.

643
00:57:50,091 --> 00:57:51,091
<i>Honey.</i>

644
00:57:51,634 --> 00:57:52,927
<i>Dongjin is here.</i>

645
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:57,015
I found out
that my father was having an affair.

646
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:58,451
<i>Why do you keep saying sorry?</i>

647
00:57:58,475 --> 00:58:00,518
<i>You don't even know
what it means to be truly sorry.</i>

648
00:58:02,979 --> 00:58:04,647
I wanted to take my revenge,

649
00:58:05,732 --> 00:58:07,066
and I wanted payback.

650
00:58:10,278 --> 00:58:12,572
I realized only too late
that it was a mistake.

651
00:58:25,251 --> 00:58:26,251
I'm sorry.

652
00:58:33,176 --> 00:58:35,386
I'm most sorry to you, Mr. Han.

653
00:59:00,662 --> 00:59:02,455
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

654
00:59:13,258 --> 00:59:14,717
It must've been hard by yourself.

655
00:59:20,515 --> 00:59:22,308
Now that I know…

656
00:59:27,146 --> 00:59:29,232
…if you could give me some time...

657
00:59:29,315 --> 00:59:30,525
What are you doing?

658
00:59:33,069 --> 00:59:34,153
You should be mad.

659
00:59:36,614 --> 00:59:38,825
"How could you do this to me?"

660
00:59:39,701 --> 00:59:43,121
"You had so many chances to tell me,
so how could you deceive me like this?"

661
00:59:43,204 --> 00:59:44,324
You should be yelling at me.

662
00:59:46,749 --> 00:59:48,751
You just got stabbed in the back.

663
00:59:50,336 --> 00:59:53,256
You got played by a woman
who was determined to deceive you.

664
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:56,551
Aren't you upset at all?

665
01:00:02,432 --> 01:00:03,891
Why are you sorry?

666
01:00:07,186 --> 01:00:08,980
Why are you looking at me like that?

667
01:00:12,942 --> 01:00:13,943
But in the end,

668
01:00:15,028 --> 01:00:16,779
you couldn't take your revenge on me.

669
01:00:21,743 --> 01:00:23,578
I wasn't ruined.

670
01:00:34,964 --> 01:00:36,090
Right now I'm just…

671
01:00:41,596 --> 01:00:42,597
I'm sad.

672
01:00:45,933 --> 01:00:46,934
I'm sorry.

673
01:00:49,354 --> 01:00:50,938
It's all my fault.
