EPISODE 11

2
00:00:34,993 --> 00:00:35,994
What's with your forehead?

3
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:38,204
I fell.

4
00:00:41,624 --> 00:00:42,459
Is it going to scar?

5
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:45,462
They said it would be okay.

6
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:07,192
Jun, you should go first.

7
00:01:08,985 --> 00:01:10,320
You should be the one to go first.

8
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:14,157
Yesterday,

9
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:17,077
when we were talking about
Dad passing away

10
00:01:17,827 --> 00:01:19,746
and us getting kicked out of the house,

11
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:23,249
I told her I quit studying
for the civil service exam

12
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:25,585
and started singing.

13
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:28,171
And…

14
00:01:29,547 --> 00:01:31,633
my mom just glared at me
with tears in her eyes

15
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:33,384
and didn't say a word.

16
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:39,474
I wished she'd just hit me instead.

17
00:01:41,142 --> 00:01:42,852
That would have been less painful.

18
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:46,189
Jeez.

19
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:50,777
Stay here, I'll call you
when the food is ready.

20
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:55,573
I love you.

21
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:13,675
I know you guys never listen to me
but just do this for once.

22
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:16,010
Don't say anything and just eat.

23
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:18,304
What about your food?

24
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:20,723
I just told you not to say anything.

25
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,311
Let's eat. Pick up your spoons.

26
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:27,105
Thank you for the food.

27
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:29,149
Jun.

28
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:31,860
I'm so indebted to you.

29
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:33,486
Please don't say that.

30
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:37,615
Just make yourself at home.
I'll feel bad if you don't.

31
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:56,009
Who wants more rice?

32
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:58,678
Give some to me.

33
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,392
That's way too much. I can't eat all that.

34
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:15,403
Mom never makes seaweed soup
unless it's someone's birthday.

35
00:03:16,487 --> 00:03:18,364
She said she had too much of it
after giving birth.

36
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:21,117
Are you seriously making a joke right now?

37
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:23,286
What joke? I'm asking
because I'm genuinely curious.

38
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:27,707
Is it your birthday, Jun?

39
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:29,876
No.

40
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:30,793
That's in winter.

41
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,545
It's Woojoo's birthday, you punk.

42
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:42,805
That's right.

43
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:47,936
So that's why Mom came to Seoul,
to cook Woojoo a birthday meal.

44
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:53,274
Just leave the dishes there
when you're done.

45
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:02,659
Let's listen to her.

46
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:05,703
And let's go out soon

47
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:08,831
so that she can at least
let out a sigh in peace.

48
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:12,210
It's suffocating even for us.

49
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:14,003
Imagine how Mom must feel.

50
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:48,139
CALL IT LOVE

51
00:05:51,642 --> 00:05:53,019
Have dinner at home.

52
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:55,480
Be back by seven, everyone.

53
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:57,315
I can't get out of my shift today.

54
00:05:58,149 --> 00:05:59,901
I'll buy the cake
on my way back from work.

55
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:02,028
We can just skip the song, right?

56
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:04,489
Why get a cake for a family in mourning?

57
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:06,157
Just skip it.

58
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:08,493
We'll get you one next time,
so don't get upset.

59
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,161
Upset about what?

60
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:12,163
Why would I be upset
about that at this age?

61
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:14,582
Why are you taking it out on me?

62
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,126
You said you'd tell her about the house.

63
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:18,753
You said you'd deal with it.

64
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:21,130
And you let her go back to that house?

65
00:06:22,006 --> 00:06:24,801
You've always looked down on me
and now I'm supposed to be the older one?

66
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:26,886
Do you think
I didn't want to say anything?

67
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:28,679
Looked down on you?

68
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:30,181
When did I ever do that?

69
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:32,558
-Hey!
-Stop it, you two.

70
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:34,977
Don't do this
in front of your little brother.

71
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:36,396
Don't mind me.

72
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:41,609
Running away because you have no comeback?

73
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:45,029
Happy birthday, Woojoo!

74
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:48,533
I'll buy you a designer bag
when I become rich and famous!

75
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:53,329
I'm going too.

76
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:57,166
Why are you going that way?
Are you not taking the bus?

77
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,919
I moved to a practice room
around here to save money.

78
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:01,003
See you later.

79
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:12,765
-Haesung.
-Not now.

80
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:14,684
Let's talk about it later.

81
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:16,352
It's not about that.

82
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:21,149
I have to go receive a drug delivery,
so I'm leaving too.

83
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:25,987
I'm not trying to avoid you,
so don't get the wrong idea.

84
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:30,450
I'm off.

85
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:32,285
All right. Go on.

86
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:35,866
What is it? Did you leave something?

87
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:38,327
I forgot to do the dishes.

88
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:40,580
I'll do it.

89
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,791
Go cry in the room.
I'll pretend I don't hear it.

90
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:48,004
I'm done crying.

91
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:50,673
Come here and do the dishes.

92
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:53,342
I have no energy for your stubbornness.

93
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:08,399
You don't have to go to work?

94
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:11,402
I took a day off.

95
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:15,281
And I'm not really working
for that company.

96
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:18,242
I'm just working temporarily
as a part-timer.

97
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:21,579
It's not like you're working part-time
because you're incapable.

98
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:23,748
There's no difference
between part-time and full-time.

99
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:26,626
You work there like everyone else.

100
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:33,174
I told Ms. Baek
I'm taking the day off

101
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:36,594
because my mom suddenly came to visit.

102
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:39,764
I'm texting you in case you get worried.

103
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:44,685
All right, have a nice time
with your mother.

104
00:11:01,535 --> 00:11:02,662
Good morning.

105
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:04,789
-Good morning, sir.
-Hey, good morning.

106
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:21,931
-Good morning!
-Oh. Drink this.

107
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:23,140
Oh, thank you.

108
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:30,106
I see Ms. Sim isn't here yet.
Is she running late?

109
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,983
She has the day off. Her mom is visiting.

110
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:37,655
So you know everything
about her now, don't you?

111
00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:40,074
How was the camping trip?

112
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:46,997
It's Kang. We keep in touch all the time.

113
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:51,085
By the way, I discovered this
while organizing some files.

114
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:53,504
Today is Ms. Sim's--

115
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:54,422
I know.

116
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:57,425
What do you know? How? Why?

117
00:11:58,008 --> 00:11:59,385
I saw it on her résumé.

118
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:05,015
How do you remember that?
That was so long…

119
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:08,602
Look at you.

120
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:12,440
You liked her way before
I caught on, didn't you?

121
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:14,650
For how long exactly?

122
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,819
I'm just curious.

123
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:30,374
Are you teasing me?

124
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:35,337
Hey. Wait.

125
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:47,683
On your way to work today, did the world…

126
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:48,601
How do I put it?

127
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:50,352
Did it look a little different?

128
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:53,147
Wasn't your heart sort of tossing,

129
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:54,899
fluttering, and thumping?

130
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:58,652
Ah, and once you listen to some music
on your earphones,

131
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:01,238
the whole world turns into a music video.

132
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:02,740
Gosh, it must be incredible.

133
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:04,200
You seem more excited than I am.

134
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:05,576
Of course it's exciting.

135
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:09,663
For once, you and I
are talking about dating, not work.

136
00:13:18,672 --> 00:13:20,549
I've never said this out loud but,

137
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:24,178
I was always sorry to you.

138
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:28,641
If only I hadn't asked you
to start a company with me…

139
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:32,019
You were already
so burdened by responsibilities,

140
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:34,063
and I went and dumped another load on you.

141
00:13:37,107 --> 00:13:39,109
Did you see the new booth arrangement?

142
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:40,277
Jeez.

143
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:41,946
You don't have to be shy.

144
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:44,615
Oh, right.

145
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:46,867
I almost forgot.

146
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:50,996
Can you ask Ms. Sim
to spare some time for me?

147
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:54,500
Kang and I should at least
thank her properly.

148
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:57,211
She saved a lonely guy,
it's the least we can do.

149
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:00,923
We should thank her,
eat together, and go for a drink.

150
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:02,132
That's how people bond.

151
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:06,262
Okay, I'll talk to her about it.

152
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:11,392
I didn't see the arrangement.
I'll get going.

153
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:14,812
Thanks for the coffee.

154
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,684
Just let it out.

155
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:59,023
When Haesung and Jigu
were crying their eyes out yesterday,

156
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:01,775
you kept your mouth shut.

157
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:06,155
It made me wonder
what was holding you back from crying.

158
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:09,074
And I thought
it must be something serious,

159
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:11,702
so I was just trying to prepare myself.

160
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:25,633
That woman is living
in the house in Yeonhui-dong.

161
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:32,681
So she…

162
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:36,769
stole my husband and my house.

163
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:40,356
And I…

164
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:44,944
What now?

165
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:48,405
I went to the funeral

166
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:52,034
of your ex-husband and my father.

167
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:57,498
I bought the flashiest clothes
at the department store.

168
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:02,378
I did my hair and makeup,
and even wore sunglasses.

169
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:05,464
I went to take revenge.

170
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,136
Because I was too young back then.

171
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:15,599
All I could do was
dive in front of his car.

172
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:20,270
I wanted to show them
how I suffered every day to just survive,

173
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:21,647
thanks to them.

174
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:22,731
JEIL FUNERAL PARLOR

175
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:25,109
"I'll just say everything
I've prepared."

176
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:26,318
"It's nothing."

177
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:29,780
"This will just be

178
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:34,159
a funny story to laugh about
over drinks for the rest of my life."

179
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:35,911
That's what I told myself.

180
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:39,790
Thirteen years ago,

181
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:42,751
when the two of you took off
with the bank account book and jewelry,

182
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,586
didn't you prepare
for this humiliation at least?

183
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,255
What, is this embarrassing?

184
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:49,341
You should be embarrassed
about your entire life.

185
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:53,721
I'm here for the ghost of the man
who's here to taste his memorial feast.

186
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:57,766
To show him that his daughter has been
waiting for this day for 13 years.

187
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,561
So?

188
00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:02,938
Did you get a funny story out of it?

189
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:17,911
Since that day,

190
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:21,832
there's been a weight on my heart.

191
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,670
Why did I do that?

192
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:31,925
Why did I go there
and remind myself of those faces?

193
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,263
It's heavy.

194
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:40,184
It's too heavy.

195
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,608
I'm sorry.

196
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:50,360
I was wrong.

197
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:25,938
Would you like a pack?

198
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:28,690
-Just this, please.
-Okay.

199
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:39,451
JUN PHARMACY

200
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,520
Let's go home.

201
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,358
Let's stay just a little longer.

202
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:18,115
JUN PHARMACY

203
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:28,792
Was it a month ago?

204
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:32,254
There was a medicine packet
sticking out of your bag.

205
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:38,594
I mean, it'd be weirder
if I didn't have a look.

206
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:43,015
So I just checked what medicine it was.

207
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:47,102
But…

208
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:52,482
If you hadn't said anything first,
I wouldn't have said anything either.

209
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,446
You should come to me next time.

210
00:19:57,988 --> 00:20:00,866
I'll take care of that stuff for you.

211
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:13,629
What is it?

212
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:16,215
Is your heart still pounding?

213
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:28,143
It's beating quite fast.

214
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:31,188
I think it's because of you.

215
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:39,029
When I thought I was losing my mind
and I couldn't even breathe,

216
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:43,283
the only thing I could think of was you.

217
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:46,495
I should go to Jun immediately.

218
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:48,789
And…

219
00:20:49,831 --> 00:20:51,541
You hugged me.

220
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:56,421
I thought my heart was fluttering
because of the hug.

221
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:03,720
But I don't think that's it.

222
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:05,347
I think

223
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:09,476
my heart was fluttering
because I like you.

224
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:34,853
Drop by the pharmacy
before you go home.

225
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,855
Let's finish what we were talking about.

226
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:52,329
Well…

227
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:55,290
Do you want to drink this?
I can just get another one.

228
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:57,709
I thought I told you
I don't drink sweet coffee.

229
00:23:04,007 --> 00:23:05,759
Let's talk for a bit
after work today.

230
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:08,428
Even if we're ending things,
we should at least talk.

231
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:11,973
Today, I--

232
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:13,725
You've dated quite a lot, right?

233
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:15,394
Did you end every relationship like this?

234
00:23:17,187 --> 00:23:19,606
-What?
-For you, with your past experiences,

235
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:23,568
maybe it's okay to let things
fizzle out in a relationship…

236
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:27,406
but it's not for me.

237
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:30,367
Okay.

238
00:23:31,034 --> 00:23:31,952
Let's meet up and talk.

239
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:34,746
Your shift ends first,

240
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:37,082
so you decide on the place
and I'll meet you there.

241
00:23:37,165 --> 00:23:38,500
That's done, then?

242
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:52,139

YOUR MAIL HAS BEEN SENT

245
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:13,743
-What is it?
-My goodness.

246
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:15,579
What is it? What happened?

247
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:17,164
Come look at this.

248
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:19,040
I think this is crossing the line.

249
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:22,419
We put up an advertisement
for senior staff, right?

250
00:24:22,502 --> 00:24:23,712
Mr. Cha applied.

251
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:27,132
That's absurd.
This is him just outright mocking us.

252
00:24:27,215 --> 00:24:28,341
I'll delete it.

253
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:29,926
No, don't just delete it.

254
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:31,636
Send a reply.

255
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:35,223
"Your application will never be considered
at Best Fairs, ever."

256
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:37,100
Seriously?

257
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:38,935
I'm serious.

258
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:40,479
How dare he?

259
00:24:41,062 --> 00:24:43,064
These shameless jerks
should be nipped in the bud.

260
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:51,865
Unbelievable.

261
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:52,884
What?

262
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:55,428
-Done for the day?
-Yes.

263
00:25:56,304 --> 00:25:57,639
Do you have a lot left to do?

264
00:25:58,848 --> 00:26:01,268
I'm just reviewing
a few of the bidding exhibitions.

265
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:04,646
By the way, the employees
are going to be surprised

266
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:06,731
because you're leaving work before me.

267
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:11,069
A big-scale bidding exhibition
is too much for now.

268
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:14,948
That's why I'm reviewing it.

269
00:26:15,031 --> 00:26:17,701
Don't worry about it
and go celebrate her birthday.

270
00:26:19,494 --> 00:26:20,579
See you tomorrow.

271
00:26:29,796 --> 00:26:32,173
Mr. Han, are you clocking out?

272
00:26:32,882 --> 00:26:33,717
Yes.

273
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:51,818
I'll have this one, please.

274
00:26:51,901 --> 00:26:52,861
How many candles would you like?

275
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:54,821
Three long ones, please.

276
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:02,203
SIM JIGU

277
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:23,224
Mom and I ate first.

278
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:25,060
Jun is also going to be late.

279
00:27:29,105 --> 00:27:31,566
You said you had to be home soon
for your sister's birthday.

280
00:27:31,941 --> 00:27:33,652
No, it's okay.

281
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:36,696
How can I believe what you say?

282
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:39,658
All you do is lie to me.

283
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:42,661
I came here

284
00:27:43,578 --> 00:27:45,455
because I thought
you were apologizing to me.

285
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:48,500
For what?

286
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:50,960
It's not like we'll date again.

287
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:53,463
Are you going to date me?

288
00:27:56,424 --> 00:27:57,467
Are you going to let it slide?

289
00:28:23,326 --> 00:28:26,621
I'm going to meet Suho.
Go home first.

290
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:30,500
Say what you have to say
and drop by the pharmacy.

291
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:31,793
Let's go in together.

292
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:38,133
Where are you? Why aren't you coming?

293
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:39,718
Are you done yet?

294
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:42,220
You should let me know
if you're going to be late.

295
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:44,264
I'm waiting.

296
00:28:49,352 --> 00:28:51,813
You thought I'd be naive
because I'm young.

297
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:56,151
You think I don't know
that you dated me just to kill time?

298
00:28:57,652 --> 00:28:58,486
Are you drunk?

299
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:01,614
If I didn't ask to talk,
it would have just ended that day, right?

300
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:08,079
I finally understood.

301
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:13,168
You must've let things fizzle out
in your relationship like this

302
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:14,878
every time.

303
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:18,006
You wouldn't even bother
arguing or fighting.

304
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:19,841
You'd just pretend to be the victim.

305
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:23,887
That's why you've never had
a meaningful relationship by this age.

306
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:27,015
It's natural that people start arguing
when they are honest with each other,

307
00:29:28,349 --> 00:29:29,434
but you avoid it.

308
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:33,104
I'm not wrong, am I?

309
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:35,064
You've never argued with anyone.

310
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:41,404
-You're right.
-Then do you want to try arguing now?

311
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,615
Argue with me.

312
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:45,867
"Was gaming more important than me?"

313
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:48,369
"Why did you share
my personal stories with others?"

314
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:49,871
Suho.

315
00:29:52,248 --> 00:29:53,625
Do you want more beer?

316
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:57,754
Or should we at least get some food?

317
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:01,174
Let me treat you for the last time.

318
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:07,096
I'm sorry if I hurt you.

319
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:09,766
I tried my best to make it work.

320
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:12,519
But I think that wasn't enough.

321
00:30:14,729 --> 00:30:16,397
I hope you meet
someone who's good for you.

322
00:30:45,134 --> 00:30:46,511
Is Haesung seeing a guy?

323
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:48,888
Yes.

324
00:30:49,889 --> 00:30:51,140
What does he do for a living?

325
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:53,184
Is he from the bank?

326
00:30:54,602 --> 00:30:57,397
He's young. I don't know the details.

327
00:30:58,231 --> 00:31:00,108
Where does Jigu work part-time?

328
00:31:02,485 --> 00:31:03,736
At a neighborhood karaoke place.

329
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:08,658
I'll let him do what he wants for now.

330
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:11,661
And when things don't work out
and he gives up,

331
00:31:11,744 --> 00:31:12,954
then I'll make him study again.

332
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:16,165
I still have the installment savings plan.

333
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:20,879
They say a person's name
determines their destiny.

334
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:23,339
And I did a terrible job naming you kids.

335
00:31:25,091 --> 00:31:26,885
"Haesung" after a comet
and "Jigu" after the Earth,

336
00:31:27,468 --> 00:31:29,679
they both float around in you,
named after the universe.

337
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:32,724
They can only survive
if the universe embraces them.

338
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:37,896
I should have named you
after a star or the moon.

339
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:40,106
I regret it.

340
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:51,242
Welcome. Just a moment.

341
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:54,662
Mom.

342
00:31:58,958 --> 00:32:00,668
I was going to
head straight home after this.

343
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:03,004
Mom wanted to see
your work before going back.

344
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:05,757
Well…

345
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:09,677
Woojoo, could we talk for a second?

346
00:32:14,682 --> 00:32:15,808
Come on.

347
00:32:16,392 --> 00:32:19,354
Woojoo, it would've been nice
if you called before you came.

348
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:21,272
Ugh…

349
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:23,316
Just take Mom out of here.

350
00:32:23,983 --> 00:32:25,485
Are you embarrassed about working here?

351
00:32:26,402 --> 00:32:27,737
It's not that.

352
00:32:28,154 --> 00:32:30,156
Dongjin is in that room right now.

353
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:31,783
What?

354
00:32:31,866 --> 00:32:33,701
He brought a cake
because it's your birthday.

355
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:36,621
I couldn't make him leave,
so I told him to wait a while.

356
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:39,540
Aren't Dongjin and Mom
not supposed to meet?

357
00:32:41,834 --> 00:32:43,002
Why not?

358
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:46,881
Why shouldn't they meet?

359
00:33:01,187 --> 00:33:04,941
Woojoo, I know everything.

360
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:07,986
I know what kind of relationship
Dongjin's mom and our mom have.

361
00:33:08,861 --> 00:33:10,321
Didn't you already know this?

362
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,658
I saw this picture,

363
00:33:13,741 --> 00:33:15,785
and I was like,
"This lady looks familiar."

364
00:33:16,285 --> 00:33:18,830
Then I remembered.

365
00:33:20,206 --> 00:33:22,792
You know Mom's friend
who used to do door-to-door sales,

366
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:24,919
the one selling makeup products.

367
00:33:25,586 --> 00:33:27,338
She was always so flashy

368
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:29,674
and she used to visit from time to time.

369
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:32,301
This is a very faint memory,

370
00:33:32,885 --> 00:33:36,347
but I think that lady fought with Mom
over money a long time ago.

371
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:54,615
They ended up meeting, after all.

372
00:34:19,766 --> 00:34:21,768
Mom, do you need to go
to the bathroom or something?

373
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:23,061
Slow down.

374
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:30,151
You two should go get tea or something.
We'll go home first.

375
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,199
It was nice meeting you.

376
00:34:36,991 --> 00:34:38,242
Thanks for the cake.

377
00:34:38,868 --> 00:34:40,078
It's nothing.

378
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:43,122
Next time, come over for dinner.

379
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:44,665
Or come to Tongyeong.

380
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:47,960
Well…

381
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:52,423
Sure.

382
00:34:54,675 --> 00:34:56,010
You're very tall.

383
00:34:57,136 --> 00:35:00,473
My daughter is quite tall as well.
You guys look good together.

384
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:03,684
Mom, you're making him uncomfortable.

385
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:05,353
I'm leaving.

386
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:08,064
-See you.
-Good night.

387
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:52,066
You were so down this morning,

388
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,234
but you seem all right now.

389
00:35:54,902 --> 00:35:56,779
Shut it. You're not helping.

390
00:35:57,613 --> 00:35:59,657
Come on, I know you're feeling better now.

391
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:06,372
It's so rare to see guys like him.
He seemed very decent.

392
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:09,083
Hmm, he also lives very decently.

393
00:36:09,458 --> 00:36:12,086
He cleans every day,
and showers every morning and night.

394
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:14,255
It's hard to do that
when a guy lives alone.

395
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:15,882
Have you been to his place?

396
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:16,799
What?

397
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:20,428
Actually, I stayed with him for a bit
when I ran away from home

398
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:21,596
to avoid Haesung and Woojoo.

399
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:25,600
When you're old, you can tell
by the way a person walks.

400
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:29,061
No, you can even tell by the way
a person holds his chopsticks.

401
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:34,400
Gentle and decent.

402
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:38,070
At least, he wouldn't make
the same mistake as your dad did.

403
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:55,713
I haven't had dinner.

404
00:36:57,757 --> 00:36:59,133
Do you want to drink soju?

405
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:02,637
We should at least have a birthday drink.

406
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:05,056
Sure.

407
00:37:06,098 --> 00:37:07,725
One bottle of soju, please.

408
00:37:07,808 --> 00:37:08,809
Coming right up.

409
00:37:20,947 --> 00:37:22,907
What did you talk about earlier?
With my mom?

410
00:37:25,117 --> 00:37:26,827
You guys were talking for a long time.

411
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:29,705
Did you talk about something fun?

412
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:33,459
What makes your mom a little different
from others is that

413
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:36,754
she didn't ask me what I do for a living,
what my parents do,

414
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:38,089
or if I have any siblings.

415
00:37:39,006 --> 00:37:41,050
She didn't ask the things
that most people her age do.

416
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:43,636
She just asked,

417
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:46,889
"What do you like about my cold daughter?"

418
00:37:52,186 --> 00:37:55,106
And she added
that even though you seem a bit cold,

419
00:37:55,189 --> 00:37:57,692
out of the three siblings,
you're the most warm-hearted one.

420
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:01,529
Once you start caring about people,
you pour your heart out to them,

421
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:04,282
and that's why you get scared
and treat them very coldly.

422
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:09,453
She also said
that if you're shown enough love,

423
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:12,915
you do show your cute side eventually.

424
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:17,962
Is that true?

425
00:38:22,925 --> 00:38:24,218
I don't have a cute side.

426
00:38:27,221 --> 00:38:30,141
But I told her I liked you
because you weren't so sweet.

427
00:38:35,104 --> 00:38:38,149
When I see someone
approaching me with a sweet smile,

428
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:42,361
I start thinking, "What if they hurt me
with that smile on their face?"

429
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:43,821
And I get scared.

430
00:38:45,364 --> 00:38:46,949
You approached me with a straight face

431
00:38:47,616 --> 00:38:50,995
and told me not to be scared
and not to be afraid.

432
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:53,539
I said that's what I liked.

433
00:38:57,251 --> 00:38:59,420
And that I think I liked you first.

434
00:39:11,432 --> 00:39:12,808
Happy birthday.

435
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:26,238
It's my birthday, so I guess this is okay.

436
00:40:58,122 --> 00:40:59,373
Come on.

437
00:40:59,915 --> 00:41:03,085
Let's turn the lights off!
We should save electricity.

438
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:07,798
It isn't too bad
being the last one to leave the office.

439
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:11,677
What the…

440
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:15,473
What?

441
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:18,976
W-What is this?

442
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:22,021
I thought you were Mr. Han.

443
00:41:28,944 --> 00:41:29,778
What?

444
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:32,573
If it were Dongjin,

445
00:41:32,656 --> 00:41:35,868
were you going to have a drink together
and beg to be hired back?

446
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:38,829
Don't even dream of it.

447
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:42,291
Even if I take you back,
Dongjin will say no.

448
00:41:43,417 --> 00:41:45,878
He was the one who first said no
to Director Kim as well.

449
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:48,964
Gosh, seriously.

450
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:51,926
As wretched as he was,
when I saw CEO Shin break down…

451
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:54,470
…it gave me nightmares for a week.

452
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:58,682
I'll pretend that I didn't see you.

453
00:41:59,391 --> 00:42:00,309
So just leave quietly.

454
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:06,148
I need to turn off the lights!

455
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:12,279
What is this?
What are you doing?

456
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:14,782
I didn't come here just to leave
without saying anything.

457
00:42:15,574 --> 00:42:17,034
My rumors have spread everywhere

458
00:42:17,117 --> 00:42:18,452
so no one will hire me.

459
00:42:21,288 --> 00:42:22,498
You hired Ms. Sim Woojoo again,

460
00:42:23,749 --> 00:42:25,334
so can't you hire me back as well?

461
00:42:48,482 --> 00:42:50,317
It was after Ms. Sim was fired

462
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:52,695
because she was mistaken for a spy.

463
00:42:53,195 --> 00:42:55,114
She told me this
when she returned later on.

464
00:42:55,698 --> 00:42:57,449
You've been caught.

465
00:42:57,950 --> 00:43:00,369
So if you really want to
ruin this company,

466
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:01,829
then try harder.

467
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:04,290
"If you want to ruin this company,
try harder."

468
00:43:05,207 --> 00:43:06,125
Thanks to her,

469
00:43:06,667 --> 00:43:07,960
I was able to buy some time

470
00:43:08,043 --> 00:43:11,422
to gather the data
and take the employees with me.

471
00:43:15,384 --> 00:43:17,469
Do you expect me to believe
what you just said?

472
00:43:17,553 --> 00:43:19,930
Are you crazy? Why would she do that?

473
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:21,432
I'm curious as well.

474
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:23,601
Why did she help me?

475
00:43:24,685 --> 00:43:27,021
If you don't believe me, ask her yourself.

476
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:29,315
One thing is for certain.

477
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:32,860
She didn't come
to Best Fairs for no reason.

478
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:35,279
There's something more.

479
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:43,162
DONGJIN

480
00:44:41,387 --> 00:44:42,471
You're going to work early.

481
00:44:46,141 --> 00:44:47,309
Are you going somewhere?

482
00:44:48,102 --> 00:44:49,103
I'm going to work too.

483
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:51,522
And going on a blind date.

484
00:44:52,856 --> 00:44:55,818
You know my mom.
She insisted I have at least one date.

485
00:45:09,331 --> 00:45:10,457
Do you want a ride?

486
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:13,085
I'll drop you off on the way.

487
00:45:13,919 --> 00:45:15,170
It's a short walk.

488
00:45:18,757 --> 00:45:21,552
I put my apartment on sale.
I'm planning on moving.

489
00:45:25,472 --> 00:45:26,724
To be really honest,

490
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:30,102
I thought you'd let me off the hook.

491
00:45:35,023 --> 00:45:37,359
I thought we'd be able
to hug each other again.

492
00:45:38,944 --> 00:45:40,988
I didn't think I'd be lonely,
so close to you.

493
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:45,075
That's why I'm moving.

494
00:45:49,455 --> 00:45:51,832
I hope you're happy. I mean it.

495
00:45:59,715 --> 00:46:01,133
I like Ms. Sim.

496
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:06,722
I want to be happy with her.

497
00:46:12,686 --> 00:46:14,480
Thanks for making an effort to tell me.

498
00:46:16,315 --> 00:46:17,399
And I knew it, to be honest.

499
00:46:20,694 --> 00:46:22,154
You should go. You'll be late.

500
00:46:54,978 --> 00:46:56,438
I like Ms. Sim.

501
00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:58,732
I want to be happy with her.

502
00:47:30,264 --> 00:47:31,807
DONGJIN'S MOTHER

503
00:47:38,939 --> 00:47:39,940
Hello?

504
00:47:41,483 --> 00:47:42,442
Gosh.

505
00:47:42,901 --> 00:47:45,821
Are you listening to me?

506
00:47:47,155 --> 00:47:48,282
Go ahead.

507
00:47:49,032 --> 00:47:50,367
Hi, it's me.

508
00:47:50,951 --> 00:47:53,453
I'm sending you an address, so go there.

509
00:47:54,246 --> 00:47:55,956
If you're busy today,
then at least tomorrow.

510
00:47:57,958 --> 00:47:59,126
Aren't you going to answer me?

511
00:48:00,794 --> 00:48:01,670
Send it.

512
00:48:07,593 --> 00:48:08,969
I mean, there is a market price.

513
00:48:09,052 --> 00:48:11,680
No one's going to spend
three billion won on that house.

514
00:48:11,763 --> 00:48:13,473
Two billion is a good enough offer.

515
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:14,850
And you run a real estate agency.

516
00:48:16,351 --> 00:48:18,687
Didn't you hear about the redevelopment?

517
00:48:19,479 --> 00:48:21,773
I'd be earning money if I kept the house.

518
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:25,027
If it wasn't urgent, I wouldn't sell it.

519
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:27,779
I'm from this neighborhood too, you know.

520
00:48:27,863 --> 00:48:30,324
I've been hearing the stories
about redevelopment for ten years.

521
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:36,330
I'll put it up,
but it probably won't sell.

522
00:49:11,448 --> 00:49:12,908
Look at all these heavy things.

523
00:49:12,991 --> 00:49:14,034
Let me help you.

524
00:49:14,576 --> 00:49:15,410
Gosh.

525
00:49:16,286 --> 00:49:17,371
Do you live here?

526
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:18,830
Who are you?

527
00:49:18,914 --> 00:49:20,916
Oh, you don't remember me?

528
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:23,377
You saw me at Yeonhui-dong.
In front of the house.

529
00:49:24,503 --> 00:49:25,545
Oh, right.

530
00:49:26,838 --> 00:49:29,091
Here's my business card.

531
00:49:29,174 --> 00:49:30,342
GOLD & CASH
CEO KANG NAMIL

532
00:49:30,425 --> 00:49:32,594
You know Ms. Ma Heeja, right?

533
00:49:34,721 --> 00:49:37,683
Let's go over there
and have a chat, shall we?

534
00:49:37,891 --> 00:49:39,476
Please.

535
00:50:03,208 --> 00:50:04,960
Suho quit all of a sudden.

536
00:50:05,043 --> 00:50:06,586
Did you two really break up?

537
00:50:09,297 --> 00:50:11,049
How about jajangmyeon for lunch?

538
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:13,969
Or tteokbokki? You love that.

539
00:50:14,094 --> 00:50:15,137
It's on me.

540
00:50:18,181 --> 00:50:19,933
You never seem to be able to eat alone.

541
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:23,729
Is there anyone who likes eating alone?

542
00:50:24,396 --> 00:50:25,897
I don't like it because it's too boring.

543
00:50:25,981 --> 00:50:27,482
Even if you don't like it,

544
00:50:27,566 --> 00:50:30,610
try eating by yourself
and try going on trips alone from now on.

545
00:50:30,902 --> 00:50:32,195
Don't spend all your time dating.

546
00:50:34,281 --> 00:50:36,867
Sorry, but I brought lunch today.

547
00:51:02,976 --> 00:51:04,019
Have you thought about it?

548
00:51:04,644 --> 00:51:05,979
Think about what?

549
00:51:06,063 --> 00:51:10,233
I just said that out of spite
because you kept on pushing.

550
00:51:10,817 --> 00:51:13,361
If I had feelings for one of them,
I shouldn't be living with them.

551
00:51:13,445 --> 00:51:14,905
I'd be a real weirdo to do that.

552
00:51:17,199 --> 00:51:19,034
Can you please just…

553
00:51:19,868 --> 00:51:23,872
Ugh, just let me live how I want to live
and how I've been living all this time.

554
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:28,502
What kind of moron gets married
just because his family told them to?

555
00:51:33,381 --> 00:51:34,925
I wasn't cursing.

556
00:51:40,555 --> 00:51:42,349
I have a customer. I'm hanging up.

557
00:52:38,113 --> 00:52:39,030
You're here.

558
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:41,533
Are you smoking again?

559
00:52:44,536 --> 00:52:45,829
I brought the prescription.

560
00:52:46,454 --> 00:52:47,831
You said you'd take care of it.

561
00:52:47,914 --> 00:52:50,500
Just unbelievable.

562
00:52:52,419 --> 00:52:54,421
-Are you sulking?
-Don't speak to me like that.

563
00:52:54,504 --> 00:52:55,672
It's annoying.

564
00:52:56,089 --> 00:52:58,341
Am I your boyfriend?
Don't use that tone on me.

565
00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:00,343
Think before you speak.

566
00:53:17,027 --> 00:53:19,654
What the heck did I do
for you to give me such bullcrap?

567
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:22,449
What? Bullcrap?

568
00:53:22,532 --> 00:53:23,742
What's your problem?

569
00:53:24,409 --> 00:53:27,120
Is it because
I stood you up yesterday? Or…

570
00:53:27,871 --> 00:53:30,290
Is it because I said
you made my heart flutter?

571
00:53:31,958 --> 00:53:34,961
What's wrong with a woman telling a man
he made her heart flutter?

572
00:53:35,045 --> 00:53:35,962
It's wrong.

573
00:53:36,922 --> 00:53:39,090
Why would there be anything
like that between you and me?

574
00:53:39,174 --> 00:53:40,425
It's gross.

575
00:53:41,009 --> 00:53:43,386
Haesung, I'm Jun.

576
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:47,224
Not someone on the streets that you can
date and break up with whenever.

577
00:53:47,807 --> 00:53:50,227
I'm your sister's friend, Jun.

578
00:53:51,144 --> 00:53:54,898
Furthermore, I know you've dated
and broken up with so many guys.

579
00:53:55,815 --> 00:53:57,067
And now it's me?

580
00:53:59,861 --> 00:54:01,238
I don't want that.

581
00:54:01,321 --> 00:54:04,824
I see you and eat with you every day,
and I don't want to be uncomfortable.

582
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:06,618
That'd be the worst!

583
00:54:10,705 --> 00:54:11,539
So…

584
00:54:12,791 --> 00:54:13,750
…what do you want?

585
00:54:17,879 --> 00:54:19,172
Let's just say it was a mistake.

586
00:54:25,387 --> 00:54:26,221
Haesung.

587
00:54:26,846 --> 00:54:28,431
Did I ask you to like me back?

588
00:54:30,058 --> 00:54:32,936
All I did was tell you
that you made my heart flutter.

589
00:54:37,774 --> 00:54:38,692
Let's stop.

590
00:54:41,069 --> 00:54:41,945
Just go, Haesung.

591
00:54:43,488 --> 00:54:45,407
Let's just say I didn't hear that…

592
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:48,535
and pretend this didn't happen.

593
00:54:50,495 --> 00:54:51,955
Did I ask you to go out with me?

594
00:54:52,998 --> 00:54:53,873
I just…

595
00:54:54,624 --> 00:54:56,960
I was just saying
that's what my heart feels.

596
00:55:01,923 --> 00:55:03,508
I broke up with Suho.

597
00:55:09,306 --> 00:55:10,473
You know what he said?

598
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:14,936
That I must have let
all my relationships fizzle out

599
00:55:16,396 --> 00:55:19,107
without even trying
to argue or fight over the issues.

600
00:55:20,483 --> 00:55:21,818
That I'd pretend to be the victim.

601
00:55:21,901 --> 00:55:24,154
That bastard knows nothing
to say those about you!

602
00:55:29,034 --> 00:55:29,951
That's what I mean.

603
00:55:42,839 --> 00:55:44,007
Eat with me.

604
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:47,344
I don't want to eat alone.

605
00:55:53,892 --> 00:55:55,685
Let's go have jajangmyeon.

606
00:56:21,795 --> 00:56:23,213
I'm not asking you to date me.

607
00:56:25,673 --> 00:56:26,508
Don't worry.

608
00:56:28,510 --> 00:56:29,969
I'm not going to even if you ask me.

609
00:56:30,678 --> 00:56:31,513
That's settled, then.

610
00:56:44,109 --> 00:56:45,235
One thing is for certain.

611
00:56:45,318 --> 00:56:48,196
She didn't come
to Best Fairs for no reason.

612
00:56:48,279 --> 00:56:49,155
There's something more.

613
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:51,908
By the way, how did Sim Woojoo
come to learn about this?

614
00:56:52,617 --> 00:56:55,620
I don't think Cha Youngmin
told her on his own.

615
00:56:55,703 --> 00:56:56,746
Did you ask her in detail?

616
00:56:56,830 --> 00:56:57,664
It's not her.

617
00:56:57,747 --> 00:57:00,917
I saw Mr. Cha a few days ago,
at the cafe near the office.

618
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,503
He asked if Ms. Sim is still working here.

619
00:57:03,586 --> 00:57:05,422
The folder with his family photos.

620
00:57:05,505 --> 00:57:06,506
Open that.

621
00:57:18,935 --> 00:57:20,019
We need to talk.

622
00:57:20,603 --> 00:57:21,771
Don't tell Dongjin.

623
00:57:53,386 --> 00:57:54,387
Well…

624
00:57:57,682 --> 00:57:58,808
So…

625
00:58:00,268 --> 00:58:04,564
I know that
you might feel offended by this,

626
00:58:04,647 --> 00:58:06,399
but I had to ask this directly.

627
00:58:06,983 --> 00:58:07,817
Well…

628
00:58:07,901 --> 00:58:12,238
Yesterday, Mr. Cha suddenly came
and said some weird things.

629
00:58:12,405 --> 00:58:14,824
He said you told him
that if he wants to ruin the company,

630
00:58:14,908 --> 00:58:17,744
he needs to try harder
and stuff like that.

631
00:58:17,827 --> 00:58:19,245
And he said that you helped him.

632
00:58:19,579 --> 00:58:23,500
I mean, when a person is cornered,
they'll just say anything,

633
00:58:24,667 --> 00:58:26,711
but why would he say that about you?

634
00:58:26,794 --> 00:58:29,380
This… This is just ridiculous.

635
00:58:30,131 --> 00:58:33,927
Oh, I'm just blabbering.

636
00:58:36,346 --> 00:58:38,598
Did you ever help Mr. Cha?

637
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:46,606
If you said it wasn't true,

638
00:58:46,689 --> 00:58:48,816
I was going to consider
his words as nonsense.

639
00:58:50,109 --> 00:58:52,737
Is it really true?

640
00:59:00,787 --> 00:59:02,372
I helped Mr. Cha.

641
00:59:03,957 --> 00:59:06,125
I told him that Mr. Han knew everything.

642
00:59:06,709 --> 00:59:08,253
I did tell him that.

643
00:59:21,683 --> 00:59:22,517
Why…

644
00:59:25,895 --> 00:59:27,105
Why did you do it?

645
00:59:27,188 --> 00:59:29,065
You must have had a reason.

646
00:59:29,148 --> 00:59:30,817
None of this is making any sense to me.

647
00:59:33,278 --> 00:59:36,114
You helped him
and then helped us at the same time?

648
00:59:36,990 --> 00:59:38,783
This doesn't make sense!

649
00:59:40,451 --> 00:59:42,620
Don't just keep your mouth shut.

650
00:59:42,704 --> 00:59:44,998
Explain yourself! You need to explain…

651
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:47,959
so I can make a decision.

652
00:59:49,377 --> 00:59:50,920
If I should keep this to myself,

653
00:59:51,796 --> 00:59:53,548
or if I should tell Dongjin.

654
01:00:01,264 --> 01:00:02,223
Ms. Sim Woojoo!

655
01:00:22,952 --> 01:00:23,786
Fine.

656
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:25,997
Our company didn't go down.

657
01:00:26,331 --> 01:00:28,458
It turned out well, in the end.

658
01:00:28,541 --> 01:00:30,209
So let's say we can just move past this.

659
01:00:31,210 --> 01:00:34,172
But you and Dongjin like each other.

660
01:00:35,548 --> 01:00:38,384
Even if you make an excuse,
saying it was before you guys found out

661
01:00:38,468 --> 01:00:40,136
about your feelings for each other,

662
01:00:41,262 --> 01:00:42,805
you should have told him afterward.

663
01:00:44,057 --> 01:00:48,936
Just think of how betrayed he'll feel
if he hears this from me.

664
01:01:19,133 --> 01:01:20,343
Hey, Dongjin.

665
01:01:20,426 --> 01:01:22,512
Do you want to go grab a drink?
It's been a while.

666
01:01:22,595 --> 01:01:24,597
I'll wrap things up and be right out.

667
01:01:24,681 --> 01:01:26,391
Next time. I have plans.

668
01:01:26,974 --> 01:01:29,227
Plans with who?

669
01:01:29,310 --> 01:01:30,645
Let's drink tomorrow.

670
01:01:30,728 --> 01:01:33,272
What are the plans?
Cancel it and drink with me today.

671
01:01:33,356 --> 01:01:36,359
Ms. Sim's brother
left some things at my place,

672
01:01:36,442 --> 01:01:37,610
and she's coming for that.

673
01:01:38,569 --> 01:01:39,696
Oh…

674
01:01:40,279 --> 01:01:41,239
Well…

675
01:01:41,322 --> 01:01:42,365
I'll see you later.

676
01:02:42,049 --> 01:02:45,052
I put away the tent that I'd
abandoned like an island for a long time.

677
01:02:46,929 --> 01:02:49,599
If I hadn't met you,

678
01:02:51,350 --> 01:02:53,478
I would've still been trapped
on that island.

679
01:02:56,189 --> 01:02:58,566
Thank you for helping me escape.

680
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:12,205
It's not too bad, right?

681
01:03:29,222 --> 01:03:31,432
I first learned how to camp
from Uncle Daehong,

682
01:03:32,016 --> 01:03:33,851
when I started middle school.

683
01:03:35,853 --> 01:03:39,023
Back then, I called him Father.

684
01:03:40,441 --> 01:03:44,987
He was the first one I called Father,
from all the men that my mother married.

685
01:03:48,366 --> 01:03:49,450
After three years, maybe?

686
01:03:50,368 --> 01:03:53,371
My mother married someone else.

687
01:03:56,082 --> 01:03:57,291
Back then, Uncle Daehong…

688
01:03:58,793 --> 01:04:02,922
…quit his job and traveled
around the country, camping.

689
01:04:05,258 --> 01:04:06,092
Since then,

690
01:04:07,927 --> 01:04:12,431
I've never had a proper home in my life.

691
01:04:19,063 --> 01:04:22,108
My mother is my weakness.

692
01:04:23,651 --> 01:04:24,944
A weakness I want to hide

693
01:04:25,903 --> 01:04:27,196
and don't want anyone to spot.

694
01:04:31,492 --> 01:04:32,827
To hide that weakness,

695
01:04:34,495 --> 01:04:36,581
I always tried so hard to look nice.

696
01:04:37,373 --> 01:04:40,376
And because of that,
I got used and betrayed a lot.

697
01:04:48,217 --> 01:04:51,012
The reason I'm telling you all of this is…

698
01:04:54,932 --> 01:04:56,434
I want to lay it all out in the open.

699
01:04:59,478 --> 01:05:00,813
I want it to work this time.

700
01:05:10,573 --> 01:05:12,116
Do you want to stay here tonight?
