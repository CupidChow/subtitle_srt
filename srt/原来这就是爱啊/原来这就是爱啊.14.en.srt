00:00:53,094 --> 00:00:55,096
(music fades out)

3
00:00:56,473 --> 00:01:00,977
CALL IT LOVE

4
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:04,939
EPISODE 14

5
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:06,858
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

6
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:15,575
It must've been hard by yourself.

7
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:21,371
(mellow music playing)

8
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:22,999
Now that I know…

9
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:26,628
(sighs)

10
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:30,006
…if you could give me some time...

11
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,382
WOOJOO: What are you doing?

12
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:35,428
You should be mad.

13
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:39,599
"How could you do this to me?"

14
00:01:40,558 --> 00:01:43,937
"You had so many chances to tell me,
so how could you deceive me like this?"

15
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,146
You should be yelling at me.

16
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:49,609
You just got stabbed in the back.

17
00:01:51,152 --> 00:01:54,447
You got played by a woman
who was determined to deceive you.

18
00:01:58,243 --> 00:01:59,869
Why are you sorry?

19
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:04,958
Why are you looking at me like that?

20
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:09,921
But in the end,

21
00:02:11,005 --> 00:02:12,757
you couldn't take your revenge on me.

22
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:19,556
I wasn't ruined.

23
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:35,071
Right now, I'm just…

24
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:41,494
(sighs)

25
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:42,829
I'm sad.
(whimpers)

26
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:47,917
(under breath)
I'm sorry.

27
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:51,880
It's all my fault.

28
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:57,885
(Woojoo sniffles)

29
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:22,994
(Woojoo sniffling)

30
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:29,042
(muffled)
My family found out everything.

31
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:33,546
(sniffling)

32
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:35,924
I wanted to keep them
from ever finding out.

33
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:39,344
I wanted to keep that hidden for you.

34
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:43,139
But they found out.

35
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,267
(sniffling)

36
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:47,477
So…

37
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:52,023
I really don't think…
(sniffles)

38
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:53,691
…we can see each other anymore.

39
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:04,285
(sniffles and sobs)

40
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:35,400
(shudders)

41
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:50,957
(sad music playing)

42
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:55,044
(footsteps echoing)

43
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:04,262

50
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:32,290
(messenger vibrates)

51
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:45,178
SUNWOO: <i>You're on your way, right?</i>

52
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:46,429
<i>What time will you be here?</i>

53
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:16,560
SOOHEE: <i>This is our new
part-time office assistant.</i>

54
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:18,424
<i>- She'll be starting tomorrow.</i>
- WOOJOO: <i>I also</i>

55
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:20,213
look forward to working with you.

56
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:23,192
WOOJOO (loudly): <i>If I said I didn't,
would you even believe me?</i>

57
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:25,676
(normally) <i>What if
I decide to team up with Mr. Cha?</i>

58
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,803
Do you trust me?

59
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:28,721
(sighs)

60
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:30,282
WOOJOO: <i>So could you just leave then?</i>

61
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:33,768
<i>But if you happen to run into her again,
please just avoid her.</i>

62
00:06:33,851 --> 00:06:34,727
<i>I don't like it.</i>

63
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:36,646
You being around my family.

64
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,458
WOOJOO (yells): <i>Go and take revenge
on her now, if you have to!</i>

65
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:41,085
<i>At the very least, trip her or something!</i>

66
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:42,527
<i>You should be out to ruin them.</i>

67
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:45,446
Why do you ruin yourself like a fool?

68
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:48,509
WOOJOO (softly): <i>You know how
sometimes you can tell a lot about someone</i>

69
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:49,573
<i>just by the way they walk?</i>

70
00:06:49,992 --> 00:06:51,869
<i>I can tell you won't go down
no matter what.</i>

71
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:53,162
<i>I know for sure.</i>

72
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:56,624
<i>I just wish</i>

73
00:06:57,875 --> 00:07:00,711
you could live
comfortably in your own place.

74
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:03,881
Are you sure
I really came here to see you?

75
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:06,001
WOOJOO: <i>So I was the only one</i>

76
00:07:07,051 --> 00:07:08,886
<i>who didn't know my own feelings.</i>

77
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:13,558
<i>You really shouldn't like me.</i>

78
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:18,271
<i>If you don't like me,
then there won't be any problem.</i>

79
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:20,898
I'm asking a favor.

80
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:22,150
<i>I…</i>

81
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:25,194
<i>Really like you a lot, Mr. Han.</i>

82
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:27,756
To the point where
I wish everyone else in the world

83
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:31,159
<i>would just disappear
and only the two of us would be left.</i>

84
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:33,828
(under breath)
I'm sorry.

85
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:37,748
It's all my fault.

86
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:55,141
WOOJOO (crying):
<i>My family found out everything.</i>

87
00:07:57,393 --> 00:07:58,633
(Woojoo sniffling in flashback)

88
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:01,856
<i>I wanted to keep them
from ever finding out.</i>

89
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:05,151
<i>I wanted to keep that hidden for you.</i>

90
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:07,236
<i>So…</i>

91
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,782
I really don't think…
(sniffles)

92
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:13,534
…we can see each other anymore.

93
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:16,579
(breaking into tears)

94
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:28,549
(sniffles)

95
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:32,136

96
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:42,980

00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:01,374
YURI: It's so cool.

101
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:03,751
Pretty good, right?

102
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:05,461
NAHYUN: You're right.
(chuckles)

103
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:06,629
(Donghan breathes happily)

104
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:08,756
(snorts, clicks tongue)

105
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:10,966
Let's go.

106
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:19,433
(Yuri laughs)

107
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:20,827
NAHYUN: What do you want for dinner?

108
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:22,454
- YURI: Trotter and buckwheat noodles?
- (Donghan exclaims)

109
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:23,705
- How about it?
- I'd love that.

110
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:24,772
YURI: Sounds nice, right?

111
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:27,547
- Should we head out?
- DONGHAN: Yes.

112
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:39,722
2022 HOLIDAY CAMPUS FESTA
RESULT REPORT

113
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:56,053
(office phone ringing in distance)

114
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:07,648
(knocking)

115
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:08,732
SUNWOO: Come in.

116
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:12,862
I mailed you the result report.

117
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,656
Okay. I'm almost done reading it.

118
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:18,117
What did CEO Han say?

119
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:20,328
He hasn't been around since lunch.

120
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:21,912
I thought you knew.

121
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:24,206
(sighs)

122
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:27,155
So I was thinking about postponing
the afternoon meeting.

123
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:30,421
Dongjin knows there's a meeting, right?

124
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:32,381
Yes.

125
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,801
Then let's stick to the schedule.
He'll make it on time.

126
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:38,387
He's never fallen behind with work.

127
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:40,305
Mmm-hmm.

128
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:45,603
(music fades out)

129
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:53,361
AGENT: <i>Your mother didn't tell you?</i>

130
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:56,864
It wasn't through me,
but the house has been sold.

131
00:10:56,947 --> 00:10:59,241
I heard they just need
to pay the remaining balance.

132
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:00,910
I see.

133
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:02,953
(sentimental guitar music playing)

134
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:07,416

135
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:10,937
AUTOMATED VOICE: <i>The person you're calling

136
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:12,088

141
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:06,809
(phone vibrating)

142
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:14,775
Hey.

143
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:15,859
Where are you?

144
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:19,780
- I had some things to take care of.
- SUNWOO: <i>The results are out.</i>

145
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:22,658
You have to check it for us
to send it to the companies tomorrow.

146
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:27,579
Where are you?

147
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:29,289
(smacks lips)

148
00:12:29,665 --> 00:12:30,708
I'm on my way.

149
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:33,084
(hanging-up beep)

150
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:37,506
MOTHER

151
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:38,590
(calling beep)

152
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:40,676
(ringing tone)

153
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,470
(breathes deeply)

154
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:45,699
AUTOMATED VOICE: <i>The person you're calling
is not available at the moment.</i>

155
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:47,892
<i>Please call at another time.</i>

156
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:51,562
(sighs)

157
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:07,953
(people clamoring on camping ground)

158
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,290
(sighs)

159
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:17,046
(music stops)

160
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:25,346
This brings back old memories.

161
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:28,057
This place

162
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:31,477
suits you really well.

163
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:37,233
If I lived with you at a place like this,

164
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:40,402
would I have the same look
on my face as you?

165
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:42,696
You seem at peace.

166
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:44,490
Jeez.

167
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:46,575
You even look younger than me.

168
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:49,578
Honestly,

169
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:53,165
I regretted it a lot.

170
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:57,753
Despite everything,
I think you were the person

171
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:01,423
who loved me the most.

172
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:06,428
Heeja.

173
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:08,346
What?

174
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:10,558
Ask what you need to ask and leave.

175
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:14,186
There's nothing pleasant
about digging up old memories.

176
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,470
I don't like talking about it.

177
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:17,898
Why don't you like it?

178
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:22,820
I used that thing
you left with me as kindling.

179
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:24,195
I burned it.

180
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:25,864
(shouts)
Are you sure?

181
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:27,992
Did you really burn it?

182
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:30,515
Getting rid of it was the only way
I wouldn't have to see you.

183
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:32,705
(breathes dumbfoundedly)

184
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:36,208
(snorts angrily)

185
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:40,170
- (stomping)
- (tense music playing)

186
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:49,764
AUTOMATED VOICE: <i>The person you're calling
is not available at the moment.</i>

187
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:53,517
JUNIOR (shouts): Namil, what did she say?

188
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,495
She told me to go ahead and do my worst.

189
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:58,355
What else can I do?

190
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:00,232
I'll have to oblige and do my worst.

191
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:03,546
JUNIOR: Then, are you really going to
report her to the police?

192
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:06,947
You know you could get mixed up in it
if things go wrong, right?

193
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:13,621
(sighs)

194
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,942
DONGJIN: I'd like a separate table
with the total number of paying visitors

195
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:27,509
apart from the other visitors.

196
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:29,510
SUNWOO: Mmm.

197
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:31,962
SOOHEE: You want to exclude
complimentary guests, right?

198
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:33,901
- Yes.
- Paying visitors are more meaningful

199
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:36,685
to the participating companies after all.

200
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:38,309
I'll make the adjustments.

201
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:49,490
Kang called to tell me that

202
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:54,078
he'd treat us to an extravagant meal
for the all-hands get-together.

203
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:57,164
Apparently, he's sold
a lot of campers at the fair.

204
00:15:57,247 --> 00:16:00,876
His booth had been the most popular booth
throughout the whole fair.

205
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,960
I know.

206
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:06,507
So he's just nagging me
to host camping fairs every quarter.

207
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:09,760
Since his company and ours will be busy

208
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:12,680
by the end of the month,

209
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:15,140
I was thinking maybe next week.
What do you think?

210
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:17,184
(tense music playing)

211
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:24,358
Then, the week after?

212
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:26,402
I…
(exhales)

213
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:29,822
…want to take some time off.

214
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:32,740
(papers slap)

215
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:33,783
What?

216
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:35,952
H-How long?

217
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:40,791
YURI: <i>I think it's my first time</i>

218
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:42,835
<i>seeing CEO Han take leave since I joined.</i>

219
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:46,588
I joined the company in 2019.

220
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,757
Isn't this a huge change of heart for him?

221
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,384
SOOHEE: A change of heart?

222
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:52,177
It certainly is.

223
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:53,971
YURI: What is it?

224
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:57,933
The camping fair finally finished today.

225
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:01,145
The accounting is done,
and the results are out.

226
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:03,439
Even I'd take some time off.

227
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:07,234
Come on, the look on his face
wasn't something like that.

228
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:33,552
(mellow music playing)

229
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:35,804
Great work today.

230
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:37,639
SOOHEE: Good work.

231
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:42,728
- YURI: Have a good evening.
- Yes, great work today.

232
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:43,687
DONGHAN: Goodbye, everyone.

233
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:46,091
- STAFF 1: Have a good evening.
- STAFF 2: Have a good one.

234
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:03,791
(Sunwoo sighs deeply)

235
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:08,336
Hey.

236
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:10,881
Are you quitting the company?

237
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:13,175
Was it a resignation instead of a leave?

238
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,469
(sighs)
I'm just cleaning up.

239
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:17,429
(sorting documents)

240
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:19,932
You're acting as if you're not returning.

241
00:18:20,015 --> 00:18:21,015
So I'm scared.

242
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:24,603
Give me a week.

243
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:28,232
(clicks tongue)

244
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:30,341
I have some things to take care of.

245
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:32,319
It won't take long.

246
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:34,987
I'm sorry.

247
00:18:36,865 --> 00:18:39,368
I shouldn't have
meddled in between you two.

248
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,663
That's not why we broke up.

249
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:45,290
And Ms. Sim
isn't that kind of a person either.

250
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:50,170
(clicks tongue)
She had a good reason for doing that.

251
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:51,922
(snorts)

252
00:18:57,594 --> 00:18:59,680
(sorting pauses)

253
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:04,393
I understand.

254
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:06,603
So did she tell you everything?

255
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:10,190
(sorting resumes)

256
00:19:11,024 --> 00:19:13,026
(inhales and snorts)

257
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:14,695
I'll tell you later.

258
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:21,952
Let me know if there's
anything I can help with.

259
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:24,829
All right?

260
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:28,500
(sighs)

261
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:31,044
Okay.

262
00:19:32,045 --> 00:19:33,172
(smacks lips)

263
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:34,381
Well then…
(sighs)

264
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:38,051
Hurry up with the cleaning
and let's have a drink.

265
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:44,600
(sorting documents)

266
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:49,448
SUNWOO:
<i>I asked him to have a drink with me,</i>

267
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,231
<i>but he wanted to stay sober.</i>

268
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:55,402
There was a lot of
work to do during the fair,

269
00:19:55,485 --> 00:19:58,488
so he seemed to be doing just fine
as if there was nothing wrong.

270
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:02,743
But he just shut down once the fair ended.

271
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:06,622
I haven't seen him have one proper meal.

272
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:09,374
And I don't think he's sleeping well.

273
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:12,586
(gulping)

274
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,463
(sighs)

275
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:18,300
Sim Woojoo came to me and said

276
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:21,220
that she wanted him to be hurt less.

277
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:23,931
And for that,
she had to be the one to tell him.

278
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:26,921
I didn't understand
what she could possibly mean by that,

279
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:28,060
and I hated her for it.

280
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:30,479
But it keeps bothering me.

281
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:32,147
Maybe I shouldn't have told him.

282
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:35,108
I mean, what does
being less hurt mean anyway?

283
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:37,361
She could've chosen
not to hurt him from the get-go.

284
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:45,452
I'm sorry.

285
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:48,205
I keep telling you things about Dongjin.

286
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,043
(exhales deeply)

287
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:57,965
I feel terrible
when I think about Dongjin,

288
00:20:58,632 --> 00:20:59,800
but I also feel scared

289
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:02,803
like a coward.

290
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:04,888
I'm afraid…

291
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:08,478
that he might decide
to never come back to work.

292
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:11,353
What would I do then?

293
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:12,646
(scoffs)

294
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:16,483
I'm so pathetic, right?

295
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:18,318
You're just honest.

296
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:20,361
It's very much like you.

297
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:25,450
(blows)

298
00:21:30,163 --> 00:21:31,623
(vehicle horn honking)

299
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:33,166
SUNWOO: Hey, wait…

300
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:40,298
(groans)

301
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:45,429
What do we do?
I can't seem to catch a taxi.

302
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:47,014
We can walk if you don't mind.

303
00:21:47,597 --> 00:21:48,473
Huh?

304
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:50,058
Maybe we'll catch one while walking.

305
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:52,394
I mean…

306
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:01,445
SUNWOO: So you don't drink anymore?

307
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:04,906
Once I started feeling less guilty,

308
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:07,367
it felt okay not to drink.

309
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:08,659
(Sunwoo giggles)

310
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:10,454
That's good.

311
00:22:13,206 --> 00:22:14,791
Don't worry too much.

312
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:17,210
Dongjin will be fine.

313
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:19,671
I think he'll be okay this time.

314
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:27,696
You know, Ms. Sim is different from me.

315
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:29,639
(uplifting music playing)

316
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:31,683
"I'm going to make sure he's hurt less."

317
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:34,728
"I want to hurt him less."

318
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:38,106
I couldn't do that.

319
00:22:41,151 --> 00:22:42,652
That's really tough to do.

320
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,322
And that means she loves him dearly.

321
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:48,176
MINYOUNG: <i>So there's no way
Dongjin wouldn't know that.</i>

322
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,659
(uplifting music builds)

323
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:10,888

324
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:14,768
AUTOMATED VOICE: <i>The number you dialed
is no longer in service.</i>

325
00:23:14,851 --> 00:23:16,812
<i>Please check the phone number.</i>

326
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:17,895

327
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:23,609

328
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:37,040

329
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:09,990
(lock clicking)

330
00:24:10,073 --> 00:24:12,367
JUN PHARMACY

331
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:35,390
WOMAN 1: Could I have
some ointment for wounds?

332
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:39,352
WOOJOO: That'll be 6,000 won.

333
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:42,856
JUN: Ms. Park Wonkyung.

334
00:24:42,939 --> 00:24:43,939
WOMAN 2: Yes.

335
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:48,570
JUN: As you can see here,
one is for mid-day.

336
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:50,363
Take this one after a meal,

337
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:53,158
and take these
before breakfast and dinner.

338
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:55,744
- Have a good day.
- WOMAN 2: Okay.

339
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:56,828
Mr. Kim Dongjin.

340
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:58,955
- MAN: Yes.
- Sir.

341
00:25:01,374 --> 00:25:04,711
- It's an eye drop. Use it before bed.
- MAN: Okay.

342
00:25:04,794 --> 00:25:06,063
WOOJOO: I'll ring it up for you.

343
00:25:06,087 --> 00:25:07,087

345
00:25:22,145 --> 00:25:24,231
(Jun sniffs and groans)

346
00:25:31,154 --> 00:25:32,154
Yes, ma'am.

347
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:34,407
Are you back in Tongyeong?

348
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:36,993
Yes, of course.

349
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:39,329
We came to work together.

350
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:44,876
Yes. Don't worry, ma'am.

351
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:55,512
WOOJOO: <i>I told him everything today.</i>

352
00:25:57,138 --> 00:25:58,598
I won't see him anymore.

353
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:04,479
(somber music playing)

354
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:06,940
You just can't.

355
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:11,152
Even if the whole world turns upside down,

356
00:26:12,362 --> 00:26:14,114
it's something you just can't do.

357
00:26:19,452 --> 00:26:22,247
You understand what I mean, right?

358
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:33,300
(somber music continues)

359
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:43,935
(music fades out)

360
00:26:47,647 --> 00:26:49,399
JUN: Is Haesung
going to be late today too?

361
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:52,902
I wouldn't know.

362
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:53,987
Call her.

363
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:58,408
She won't answer my calls.

364
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:02,218
I just think it's weird
that she won't show her face all day long.

365
00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:05,665
JIGU: Jun.

366
00:27:07,667 --> 00:27:08,667
Things aren't cool.

367
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:11,963
It's better not to see each other
than to fight.

368
00:27:12,422 --> 00:27:13,422
You should know better.

369
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,467
Don't you think you should know better?

370
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:16,843
(inhales)

371
00:27:16,926 --> 00:27:17,926
Let's eat.

372
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:20,304
(sighs)

373
00:27:23,266 --> 00:27:24,266
(chopsticks clatter)

374
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:27,604
Why don't you eat some more?

375
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:29,967
Soak the dishes when you're done.

376
00:27:33,234 --> 00:27:34,944
Woojoo, I'll do the dishes from now on.

377
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:36,613
I'll make breakfast too.

378
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:38,948
Anyway, I'm just letting you know.

379
00:27:39,032 --> 00:27:40,116
WOOJOO: Whatever.

380
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:48,500
And I'm going to stop working
at your pharmacy.

381
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:50,919
Hmm?

382
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:53,588
WOOJOO: I'll keep working
until I find another job.

383
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:55,215
You should find someone.

384
00:27:55,298 --> 00:27:57,098
It won't be easy
by yourself during lunchtime.

385
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:04,432
(mouse wheel rolling)

386
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:24,285

(indistinct noise on television)

393
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:52,359
I'M SORRY…WHEN ARE YOU COMING HOME?
DO YOU WANT TO HAVE DINNER TOGETHER?

394
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:57,694
JIGU: Jun.

395
00:28:59,112 --> 00:29:00,672
Will you be okay alone at the pharmacy?

396
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:03,158
(snorts, clicks tongue)

397
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:04,701
JIGU: I'm sure it will work out.

398
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:10,415
I've been waiting to find the right time
to have it out with Woojoo.

399
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:14,252
I was going to yell at her
so she couldn't even make a squeak.

400
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:18,631
The more I thought about it,
the angrier I became.

401
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:22,260
And it was the first time in my life
that I could rightfully yell at her.

402
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:24,971
"I can't let this chance slide by."

403
00:29:25,054 --> 00:29:26,806
"I should look for a good moment."

404
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:29,434
That's what I've been thinking.

405
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:32,519
And?

406
00:29:33,396 --> 00:29:34,396
Well…

407
00:29:34,564 --> 00:29:35,648
It seems

408
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:40,361
that I must really love
my dumb sister, Sim Woojoo.

409
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:42,530
And I mean a lot.

410
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:44,783
(contemplative music playing)

411
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:46,367
I've just been having these thoughts.

412
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:47,994
I wish I had matured sooner.

413
00:29:48,077 --> 00:29:51,039
Instead of singing, I should've prepared
for the civil service exam,

414
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:53,625
got a job, and made some money.

415
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:56,961
Then she wouldn't have
thought about taking revenge.

416
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:57,921
(smacks lips)

417
00:29:58,004 --> 00:29:59,881
Then she wouldn't have met Dongjin either.

418
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:03,358
JUN: You don't need to take it that far.

419
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:07,931
She can't even cry in front of us
because she feels so bad.

420
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:12,018
Ugh, I don't know
why I feel so sorry about that.

421
00:30:17,357 --> 00:30:18,357
(smacks lips)

422
00:30:18,858 --> 00:30:20,151
JUN: Sim Jigu is all grown up.

423
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:21,945
(commentator speaking indistinctly on TV)

424
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:23,988
(Jun smacks lips)

425
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:26,783
(gulping on drink)

426
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:28,618
That must be a home run.

427
00:30:31,037 --> 00:30:33,081
(contemplative music continues)

428
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:34,874

429
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:40,630

00:30:48,304 --> 00:30:50,306

431
00:31:11,494 --> 00:31:13,496

436
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:55,622
(messenger vibrating)

437
00:32:01,544 --> 00:32:02,712
HAESUNG

438
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:12,764
(calling beep)

439
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:16,350
Haesung.

440
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:17,601
HAESUNG: <i>Woojoo.</i>

441
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:20,480
<i>The three of us are going to move.</i>

442
00:32:23,858 --> 00:32:25,818
(music fades out)

443
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:29,864
(stomps twice)

444
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:31,074
(exhales in relief)

445
00:32:31,157 --> 00:32:32,492
(doorbells jingling)

446
00:32:45,004 --> 00:32:47,799
Did you have to hurry on over
just because I said we were moving?

447
00:32:47,882 --> 00:32:49,425
Why suddenly move?

448
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:51,176
Do you have money?

449
00:32:52,011 --> 00:32:54,013
(chopsticks clattering)

450
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:56,724
Can't we move if we have no money?

451
00:32:58,267 --> 00:33:00,311
Excuse me. A bottle of soju here.

452
00:33:00,728 --> 00:33:02,355
WOOJOO: No, it's okay.

453
00:33:02,438 --> 00:33:03,918
HAESUNG: No, please give me a bottle.

454
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:07,151
It's not for you. I'm going to drink it.

455
00:33:11,864 --> 00:33:13,282
I've been searching for a few days

456
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:15,535
and picked the most decent ones
among them.

457
00:33:16,202 --> 00:33:17,787
Pick a place you want to move to.

458
00:33:18,287 --> 00:33:19,956
(Haesung gulping on drink)

459
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:22,666
(places glass)

460
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:26,004
It's a 40-minute bus ride from here.

461
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:29,590
Forty minutes from Seoul is pretty decent.

462
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:32,093
Mom said she could help us
with 20 million,

463
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:34,846
and I can open my savings
and cancel my insurance

464
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:36,264
to withdraw up to 40 million.

465
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:39,475
All you have to do is just pack and move.

466
00:33:40,226 --> 00:33:41,226
Haesung.

467
00:33:44,897 --> 00:33:46,232
Do as I say.

468
00:33:46,774 --> 00:33:48,192
I'm not trying to fight you.

469
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:51,738
I'm just trying to be
the older sister starting now.

470
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:55,450
I should have done this sooner.

471
00:33:56,993 --> 00:34:00,705
We'll move to a new neighborhood
and start fresh.

472
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:02,999
Then things will get better.

473
00:34:05,626 --> 00:34:07,086
Or should we just keep living here?

474
00:34:08,254 --> 00:34:10,590
- That woman's son...
- Don't call him that.

475
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:15,719
Okay.

476
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:17,888
Mr. Han Dongjin.

477
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:22,602
His house and workplace
are all around here.

478
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:25,104
What if you run into him on the street?

479
00:34:26,022 --> 00:34:27,482
Obviously, you won't even say hi.

480
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:29,984
So you'd have to pretend
not to see him and ignore him.

481
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:31,902
Can you really do that?

482
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:34,822
Would you be able to do that?

483
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:38,159
No.

484
00:34:38,785 --> 00:34:39,786
But…

485
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:44,373
I wish I'd run into him.

486
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:46,459
What?

487
00:34:46,542 --> 00:34:48,503
(sentimental music playing)

488
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:53,132
I wish I could at least see him like that.

489
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:00,765
I'm sorry.

490
00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:07,021
(sighs deeply)

491
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:09,065
(gulping)

492
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:19,951
(gulping)

493
00:35:20,701 --> 00:35:21,701
(places glass)

494
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:29,252
(sentimental music builds)

495
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:38,761
HAESUNG: Let's just move.

496
00:35:39,762 --> 00:35:41,264
You can't live in this neighborhood.

497
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:48,354
Mark my words.

498
00:35:49,355 --> 00:35:50,398
I'm moving.

499
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:52,942
And if I move, you're moving too.

500
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:54,735
(sighs)

501
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:03,786
(saucepan sizzling)

502
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:05,496
JUN: Wow, Sim Jigu.

503
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:06,940
Have a seat. I just need the soup.

504
00:36:09,041 --> 00:36:10,126
JUN: What about the others?

505
00:36:10,209 --> 00:36:11,335
(saucepan sizzling)

506
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:13,004
They weren't in their rooms.

507
00:36:13,963 --> 00:36:14,963
JUN: Both of them?

508
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:16,006
JIGU: No.

509
00:36:16,048 --> 00:36:17,048
(calling beep)

510
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:19,427
Who are you calling? Woojoo?

511
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:20,595
Huh?

512
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:23,222
If she's at the store,
tell her to get some green onions.

513
00:36:25,808 --> 00:36:27,727
HAESUNG

514
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:32,273
(sentimental song playing)

515
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:39,989
(female vocals singing)

516
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:17,652
WOOJOO: <i>When I said that I hated
how you looked dumb from behind,</i>

517
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:23,783
I was lying.

518
00:37:27,286 --> 00:37:30,873
At first, you looked lonely.

519
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:36,504
WOOJOO: <i>Then I felt bad for you.</i>

520
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:45,221
I really wanted to give you a hug.

521
00:37:54,188 --> 00:37:55,356
I'm just saying.

522
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:16,002
That's enough beer.

523
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:18,628
(chuckles)

524
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:15,186
(song continues)

525
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:27,406
(lock clicks)

526
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,482
(song fades out)

527
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,328
Is it something serious?

528
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:17,265
Have you been able to reach my mother?

529
00:40:17,289 --> 00:40:18,332
(sighs)

530
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:19,917
I can't get in touch with her.

531
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:23,671
She changed her number
and isn't coming to her house.

532
00:40:28,717 --> 00:40:30,719
- Did she...
- DAEHONG: Find another man?

533
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:32,888
That's possible.

534
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:36,892
I'm sorry to suddenly
show up and ask this.

535
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:38,936
What are you sorry for?

536
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,646
Dongjin.

537
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:44,483
You don't remind me of Heeja.
You're your own person.

538
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:48,737
You don't have to talk about your mom
with such guilt and difficulty.

539
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:51,281
Okay.

540
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:56,454
(gulping)

541
00:40:57,371 --> 00:40:58,371
(smacks lips)

542
00:40:59,165 --> 00:41:00,374
She came by the other day.

543
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:05,379
I was about to go see you regarding that,
but you showed up here instead.

544
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:09,175
Sometime last year,

545
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:12,553
she suddenly came here
and left this with me.

546
00:41:13,512 --> 00:41:16,807
I didn't want to trouble myself,
so I wasn't going to open it.

547
00:41:17,391 --> 00:41:19,560
But it turns out that it was a will.

548
00:41:20,686 --> 00:41:22,980
(paper rustling)

549
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:26,609
WILL
TESTATOR: SIM CHULMIN

550
00:41:26,692 --> 00:41:28,068
(mellow music playing)

551
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:31,363
DONGHAE: She came looking for this,
so I told her that I burned it.

552
00:41:32,364 --> 00:41:33,616
Goodness.

553
00:41:33,699 --> 00:41:35,367
Such a greedy woman.

554
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:38,162
I tried to dissuade her,
but she wouldn't listen.

555
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:42,750
I know you've had a hard time
all your life because of your mom.

556
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:47,254
So I was worried I'd be stressing you
with an unnecessary burden

557
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:49,590
and wanted to get rid of it.

558
00:41:52,426 --> 00:41:55,466
But I kept thinking about the children
of that family whom I don't even know.

559
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:57,055
(smacks lips)

560
00:41:58,807 --> 00:41:59,807
I'm sorry.

561
00:42:03,437 --> 00:42:05,814
No. Thank you.

562
00:42:08,484 --> 00:42:10,277
For giving it to me
instead of discarding it.

563
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:12,071
(trembling)

564
00:42:16,784 --> 00:42:19,745

DONGJIN: <i>Last year would mean…</i>

566
00:42:28,254 --> 00:42:29,922
DAEHONG: <i>It's before the funeral.</i>

567
00:42:30,923 --> 00:42:35,636
<i>This family probably has no idea
such a will even exists.</i>

568
00:42:37,763 --> 00:42:40,975
HEEJA: <i>You left first, leaving me alone.</i>

569
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:44,395
So now, I only have him next to me.

570
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:46,605
Where did you get the money?

571
00:42:46,689 --> 00:42:50,109
I didn't steal it. It's mine.

572
00:42:50,192 --> 00:42:51,352
HEEJA: <i>What about this house?</i>

573
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:54,113
How many times
do I have to tell you this house is mine?

574
00:42:54,697 --> 00:42:56,699
(mellow music continues)

575
00:43:05,499 --> 00:43:07,501
(bus engine rumbling)

576
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:16,218
(mellow music continues)

577
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:23,934
(lock clicks)

578
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:26,020
JUN PHARMACY

579
00:43:26,103 --> 00:43:27,479
(music fades out)

580
00:43:27,563 --> 00:43:29,523
Go on ahead. I'm meeting someone.

581
00:43:32,651 --> 00:43:33,861
Guess who I'm meeting.

582
00:43:35,821 --> 00:43:37,781
Aren't you meeting Haesung at the bank?

583
00:43:39,158 --> 00:43:40,200
Go ahead.

584
00:43:41,702 --> 00:43:42,702
Hey.

585
00:43:45,205 --> 00:43:46,206
(smacks lips)

586
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:48,167
Do you know or not?

587
00:43:48,751 --> 00:43:49,751
Know what?

588
00:43:50,252 --> 00:43:51,252
(smacks lips)

589
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:52,794
Never mind. See you later.

590
00:43:54,423 --> 00:43:55,424
(sighs)

591
00:43:57,468 --> 00:43:59,970
The kindest person
in our family is Haesung.

592
00:44:01,347 --> 00:44:03,057
She'd pretend to hit me,

593
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:05,809
but she never really hit me
even as a joke.

594
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:06,893
Except for that day.

595
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:10,481
Just tell her you're sorry three times.

596
00:44:11,231 --> 00:44:12,511
Then she'll accept your apology.

597
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:15,531
She forgave even me,
so I'm sure you'll be fine.

598
00:44:17,196 --> 00:44:18,196
I'll keep that in mind.

599
00:44:19,573 --> 00:44:20,699
See you.

600
00:44:21,408 --> 00:44:22,826
(footsteps)

601
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:24,912
(mellow music playing)

602
00:45:43,365 --> 00:45:44,450
(door slams)

603
00:45:47,202 --> 00:45:48,787
(reminiscing music playing)

604
00:45:53,667 --> 00:45:54,752
(door clicking echoes)

605
00:45:56,044 --> 00:45:57,044
NAMIL: Excuse me.

606
00:45:57,629 --> 00:45:58,756
Are you Mr. Sim's daughter?

607
00:46:01,133 --> 00:46:02,133
Hmm, I guess you are.

608
00:46:05,888 --> 00:46:08,074
- (playback beep)
- HEEJA (recorded): <i>This is outrageous!</i>

609
00:46:08,098 --> 00:46:11,977
<i>The will doesn't mention my name anywhere!</i>
(panting angrily)

610
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:14,855
<i>I've done more than enough
for him as a wife,</i>

611
00:46:14,938 --> 00:46:16,899
<i>and he couldn't bother
to even leave me a penny!</i>

612
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:21,570
<i>The only asset he has left is that house,
and even that is left to his kids.</i>

613
00:46:21,653 --> 00:46:22,780
(stopping beep)

614
00:46:22,863 --> 00:46:26,325
I'll send the rest to your phone,
so give me your number.

615
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:30,829
Come on, relax.

616
00:46:30,913 --> 00:46:33,707
I'm just trying to help
you and your family out.

617
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:37,002
I don't need the recording.

618
00:46:38,003 --> 00:46:39,003
Get me the will.

619
00:46:40,506 --> 00:46:42,216
(resolute music playing)

620
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:43,550
You don't have it, do you?

621
00:46:44,384 --> 00:46:45,844
The person on the other line is you.

622
00:46:45,928 --> 00:46:47,179
Darn it.

623
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:51,725
This is why you got your house taken.
You're so stupid.

624
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:53,477
Stop trying to be smart.

625
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:56,021
Just use this recording to sue that woman.

626
00:46:56,104 --> 00:46:59,942
I'm giving you a chance at revenge,
so all you need to do is say thank you.

627
00:47:00,067 --> 00:47:01,267
I've already taken my revenge.

628
00:47:02,110 --> 00:47:03,153
What?

629
00:47:04,613 --> 00:47:05,656
I'm warning you.

630
00:47:06,782 --> 00:47:08,742
Don't even think about
suing that woman with that.

631
00:47:09,493 --> 00:47:11,662
Or I'm going to sue you too.

632
00:47:12,246 --> 00:47:13,413
Don't do anything.

633
00:47:14,331 --> 00:47:15,666
Don't mess with anyone.

634
00:47:19,878 --> 00:47:20,921
I mean…

635
00:47:23,215 --> 00:47:25,175
What is the matter
with the women in that family?

636
00:47:29,137 --> 00:47:30,639
Ugh, darn it.

637
00:47:35,143 --> 00:47:37,063
JIHYUNG: Are you going
house hunting again today?

638
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:40,649
There are so many houses in Seoul.
There is no end no matter how many I see.

639
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:44,528
When you finally see some place nice,
you find something wrong with it.

640
00:47:45,445 --> 00:47:47,885
If there's one thing you like,
something else will bother you.

641
00:47:48,407 --> 00:47:50,742
You won't be able to move
within the year at that rate.

642
00:47:50,826 --> 00:47:53,370
If you find something
that you really like, just get it.

643
00:47:53,453 --> 00:47:55,622
My neighborhood is pretty okay.
And it's not that far.

644
00:47:56,832 --> 00:47:57,708
(giggles)

645
00:47:57,791 --> 00:47:59,877
It's too close. I want to go farther away.

646
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:00,960
NARAE: Pfft.

647
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:05,299
By the way,
that man has been staring at you.

648
00:48:05,382 --> 00:48:06,383
Do you know him?

649
00:48:07,301 --> 00:48:08,302
JIHYUNG: Huh?

650
00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:10,053
It's the handsome pharmacist.

651
00:48:10,137 --> 00:48:11,138
EUNHEE: Pharmacist?

652
00:48:11,221 --> 00:48:12,221
JIHYUNG: Mmm-hmm.

653
00:48:12,973 --> 00:48:14,057
He's my sister's friend.

654
00:48:14,766 --> 00:48:17,185
Let's go. We'll go home first.
See you tomorrow.

655
00:48:17,269 --> 00:48:18,437
- See you tomorrow.
- Bye.

656
00:48:23,775 --> 00:48:25,736
(tender music playing)

657
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:27,362
Did you have dinner?

658
00:48:29,364 --> 00:48:30,699
It's not time yet.

659
00:48:32,117 --> 00:48:33,160
Exactly.

660
00:48:33,243 --> 00:48:35,883
So let's go have dinner together.
I'll buy you something delicious.

661
00:48:38,957 --> 00:48:39,957
How about steak?

662
00:48:44,046 --> 00:48:45,046
(smacks lips)

663
00:48:45,964 --> 00:48:46,964
Haesung.

664
00:48:48,634 --> 00:48:49,760
No, Ms. Sim Haesung.

665
00:48:50,344 --> 00:48:52,596
Could you please have dinner with me

666
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:55,182
and stop being angry with me?

667
00:49:03,982 --> 00:49:06,401
Okay, let's go.

668
00:49:06,985 --> 00:49:08,028
Follow me.

669
00:49:09,154 --> 00:49:11,156
(tender music continues)

670
00:49:18,121 --> 00:49:20,123
(cart rolling)

671
00:49:25,045 --> 00:49:26,171
HAESUNG: Thank you.

672
00:49:29,383 --> 00:49:30,383
JUN: Thank you.

673
00:49:34,054 --> 00:49:35,054
Come on.

674
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:37,349
Rice and soup are not the way.

675
00:49:38,433 --> 00:49:39,685
No, this isn't right.

676
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:42,020
Let's stick to our routine.

677
00:49:42,354 --> 00:49:44,940
Since when did we go out to have steak?

678
00:49:45,857 --> 00:49:48,026
Will you stop going on about that routine?

679
00:49:51,071 --> 00:49:53,407
If I talked to you in a serious manner,

680
00:49:54,324 --> 00:49:56,034
I thought you'd be even more upset.

681
00:49:57,077 --> 00:49:58,870
I wasn't looking down on you.

682
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:01,331
I was secretly scared to death.

683
00:50:03,166 --> 00:50:04,166
(snorts)

684
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:05,836
I know.

685
00:50:07,796 --> 00:50:08,922
All day long,

686
00:50:09,631 --> 00:50:12,551
I keep thinking about what it would take
for you to stop being angry.

687
00:50:14,761 --> 00:50:17,097
- You want a pat on the back?
- No.

688
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:21,100
Forgive me.

689
00:50:24,688 --> 00:50:25,856
I won't do that again.

690
00:50:27,566 --> 00:50:28,692
I'm sorry.

691
00:50:31,778 --> 00:50:33,488
I'm not sure what you won't do again.

692
00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:37,075
Okay, fine. Just eat.

693
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:39,578
(chopsticks tapping)

694
00:50:43,665 --> 00:50:46,209
I'll tell you my thoughts after eating.

695
00:50:52,090 --> 00:50:53,170
It's going to take a while.

696
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:01,725
(Haesung munching)

697
00:51:01,808 --> 00:51:03,810
(tender music playing)

698
00:51:13,028 --> 00:51:18,950
Why would you two have hidden
something that big from me?

699
00:51:21,578 --> 00:51:23,497
Was I that untrustworthy?

700
00:51:24,456 --> 00:51:25,791
I'd sometimes think that.

701
00:51:27,334 --> 00:51:28,460
But then I'd think,

702
00:51:29,211 --> 00:51:31,171
"No, this is on those
who kept it a secret."

703
00:51:33,465 --> 00:51:35,634
As I watched Woojoo withering away,

704
00:51:36,968 --> 00:51:38,768
I realized she was the one
suffering the most.

705
00:51:40,013 --> 00:51:41,473
So I'd calm down a little.

706
00:51:43,308 --> 00:51:45,685
But I was still mad at you.

707
00:51:49,648 --> 00:51:51,650
(gulping)

708
00:51:55,737 --> 00:52:00,534
Honestly, it's not like
what you did was something so terrible.

709
00:52:01,284 --> 00:52:02,619
So why was I still mad at you?

710
00:52:03,870 --> 00:52:04,871
Why…

711
00:52:06,915 --> 00:52:08,375
Why am I still upset?

712
00:52:12,546 --> 00:52:13,546
Because I wronged you.

713
00:52:16,883 --> 00:52:17,883
It's not that.

714
00:52:21,096 --> 00:52:22,097
(sighs)

715
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:24,890
I think…

716
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:28,895
I was being jealous.

717
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:34,067
When you said

718
00:52:36,069 --> 00:52:38,113
that you've felt sorry for Woojoo
since you were 17…

719
00:52:41,408 --> 00:52:43,160
I felt so bad for her.

720
00:52:45,412 --> 00:52:46,663
But in my mind, I was thinking,

721
00:52:47,998 --> 00:52:51,251
"Ugh, I'm less important than Woojoo."

722
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:53,420
"To Yoon Jun,

723
00:52:55,172 --> 00:52:56,298
I'm second to her."

724
00:52:57,549 --> 00:53:01,136
"Then do I have to be jealous
of my sister for the rest of my life?"

725
00:53:03,263 --> 00:53:05,182
"That is too horrible."

726
00:53:05,307 --> 00:53:07,100
JUN: What are you even saying?

727
00:53:07,184 --> 00:53:09,853
You're just the same as Woojoo for...

728
00:53:09,936 --> 00:53:11,438
HAESUNG: I don't want to be the same.

729
00:53:12,189 --> 00:53:13,189
I want…

730
00:53:16,902 --> 00:53:18,653
I wanted to be a woman to you.

731
00:53:26,953 --> 00:53:31,166
I'm not asking you
to pick who's first and second.

732
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:32,750
I'm just…

733
00:53:32,792 --> 00:53:34,002
(music stops)

734
00:53:35,837 --> 00:53:37,130
I'm saying that I'm giving up.

735
00:53:39,841 --> 00:53:41,676
(somber music playing)

736
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:42,844
We're moving out.

737
00:53:44,346 --> 00:53:48,016
Let's just get together twice a year…

738
00:53:50,852 --> 00:53:52,020
and live our lives like that.

739
00:54:02,405 --> 00:54:05,158
(gulping)

740
00:54:06,785 --> 00:54:08,787
(somber music continues)

741
00:54:29,474 --> 00:54:30,517
(sighs)

742
00:54:33,812 --> 00:54:35,855
(indistinct chatter)

743
00:54:44,614 --> 00:54:46,408
(music fades out)

744
00:54:47,993 --> 00:54:48,993
What?

745
00:54:49,869 --> 00:54:51,371
I thought I recognized someone.

746
00:54:54,165 --> 00:54:55,165
Who?

747
00:54:56,418 --> 00:54:57,419
I must be mistaken.

748
00:54:59,087 --> 00:55:01,089
(indistinct chatter)

749
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:08,096
(mellow music playing)

750
00:55:16,938 --> 00:55:17,938
(sighs)

751
00:55:38,209 --> 00:55:39,252
(security keypad beeps)

752
00:55:51,431 --> 00:55:53,433
(music fades out)

753
00:55:55,477 --> 00:55:57,479
(distant munching)

754
00:56:01,649 --> 00:56:02,650
(Dongjin sighs)

755
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:04,778
(utensils clinking)

756
00:56:07,614 --> 00:56:09,574
(slurping and munching)

757
00:56:09,657 --> 00:56:10,575
(gasps)

758
00:56:10,658 --> 00:56:13,161
Why are you standing there like that?

759
00:56:13,995 --> 00:56:15,955
If you haven't eaten, come eat.

760
00:56:17,415 --> 00:56:20,001
You didn't try to call me, did you?

761
00:56:20,085 --> 00:56:22,379
Gosh, I changed my number.

762
00:56:22,462 --> 00:56:24,798
(chopsticks rattle, phone thuds)

763
00:56:26,341 --> 00:56:27,467
(calling beep)

764
00:56:29,803 --> 00:56:32,013
- (phone vibrates)
- This is my number. Save it.

765
00:56:32,514 --> 00:56:34,474
(chopsticks rattle)

766
00:56:35,016 --> 00:56:37,060
I've been getting
a lot of unwanted calls lately,

767
00:56:37,143 --> 00:56:39,437
so I changed my number.
(chuckles)

768
00:56:39,521 --> 00:56:41,481
(chopsticks clinking)

769
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:43,400
(Heeja slurping and munching)

770
00:56:45,652 --> 00:56:48,029
DONGJIN: <i>When I was 13…</i>

771
00:56:50,115 --> 00:56:52,396
when you first started having an affair
with a married man

772
00:56:53,159 --> 00:56:54,953
and you didn't come home days at a time,

773
00:56:56,496 --> 00:56:59,124
do you know
what I'd been doing by myself at home?

774
00:57:00,959 --> 00:57:02,168
I kept on looking…

775
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:07,257
at myself in the mirror, for hours.

776
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:10,301
And…

777
00:57:12,011 --> 00:57:13,221
I was relieved.

778
00:57:17,892 --> 00:57:19,310
I was like, "Thank God."

779
00:57:22,105 --> 00:57:24,732
Because there was nothing
I took after you.

780
00:57:25,483 --> 00:57:26,526
(scoffs)

781
00:57:27,402 --> 00:57:30,402
DONGJIN: It's not like I tolerated
all that because I had a lot of patience.

782
00:57:30,697 --> 00:57:32,240
And I wanted to do away with…

783
00:57:32,323 --> 00:57:34,284
(mellow music playing)

784
00:57:35,368 --> 00:57:37,120
…that good-boy image
on multiple occasions.

785
00:57:38,288 --> 00:57:39,289
But I didn't.

786
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:43,209
I just wanted to be seen
as my father's son.

787
00:57:49,424 --> 00:57:51,468
That's why I didn't address you as Mother.

788
00:57:53,845 --> 00:57:55,847
There were times I really wanted to.

789
00:57:58,349 --> 00:58:00,059
(sighs)
But I restrained myself.

790
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:01,644
(scoffs)

791
00:58:02,854 --> 00:58:04,105
Did you have a drink?

792
00:58:04,939 --> 00:58:05,857
Are you drunk?

793
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:07,233
DONGJIN: I'm telling you

794
00:58:07,525 --> 00:58:08,735
that I was unhappy.

795
00:58:12,322 --> 00:58:14,699
I'm telling you
that I've never been happy.

796
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:16,200
(scoffs)

797
00:58:16,993 --> 00:58:18,578
Everyone lives like that.

798
00:58:19,204 --> 00:58:21,164
I'm not happy either.

799
00:58:24,292 --> 00:58:25,460
(sucks teeth in displeasure)

800
00:58:25,543 --> 00:58:27,337
Let's talk tomorrow. I'm tired.

801
00:58:28,796 --> 00:58:29,923
The will.
(trembles)

802
00:58:32,383 --> 00:58:33,551
I have it.

803
00:58:34,052 --> 00:58:36,095
(stuttering)

804
00:58:36,179 --> 00:58:37,180
What?

805
00:58:37,472 --> 00:58:39,057
I wanted to head over there

806
00:58:39,974 --> 00:58:41,974
to return it to them
and apologize a hundred times.

807
00:58:43,394 --> 00:58:47,315
But I thought you should know first.

808
00:58:48,066 --> 00:58:49,984
(shudders)

809
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:53,154
(whimpers)
It's all good now.

810
00:58:54,822 --> 00:58:57,617
Wait, are you really
going to give it to them?

811
00:58:57,700 --> 00:58:59,953
(panting)

812
00:59:00,036 --> 00:59:01,120
Dongjin!

813
00:59:01,496 --> 00:59:03,248
Do you want to see me die?

814
00:59:03,873 --> 00:59:07,377
(stutters)
That's mine. It's ours.

815
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:11,881
Dongjin, your mom can't live without that.

816
00:59:11,965 --> 00:59:13,800
(whimpering)

817
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:17,637
(tense music playing)

818
00:59:19,806 --> 00:59:23,309
You have to live without it.

819
00:59:28,439 --> 00:59:29,524
(scoffs in disbelief)

820
00:59:31,401 --> 00:59:32,860
(groans dejectedly)

821
00:59:33,194 --> 00:59:35,738
- (door opens)
- (weeping)

822
00:59:35,822 --> 00:59:36,822
(door shuts)

823
00:59:38,658 --> 00:59:40,743
(tense music continues)

824
01:00:07,186 --> 01:00:09,188
(music fades out)

825
01:00:12,358 --> 01:00:13,359
(calling beep)

826
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:21,951
Mom.

827
01:00:22,952 --> 01:00:23,952
HYUNJU: <i>What?</i>

828
01:00:26,497 --> 01:00:29,417
There's a will that Dad left to us.

829
01:00:31,669 --> 01:00:32,669
He left…

830
01:00:34,631 --> 01:00:36,215
that house to us.

831
01:00:41,095 --> 01:00:42,764
I found out today.

832
01:00:44,182 --> 01:00:45,975
That woman had been hiding it.

833
01:00:52,023 --> 01:00:53,608
If we want to get the house back,

834
01:00:55,985 --> 01:00:59,072
we have to report her to the police.

835
01:01:02,325 --> 01:01:04,952
But then, what about him?

836
01:01:07,914 --> 01:01:09,624
She's his mom.

837
01:01:11,751 --> 01:01:13,086
(resolute music playing)

838
01:01:13,169 --> 01:01:15,296
He said that his mom was his weakness.

839
01:01:20,426 --> 01:01:21,719
I feel sorry for him.

840
01:01:23,846 --> 01:01:24,847
(sighs)

841
01:01:26,015 --> 01:01:27,642
It kills me how sorry I am for him.

842
01:01:34,857 --> 01:01:36,734
I don't want him to suffer anymore.

843
01:01:41,531 --> 01:01:42,531
I just wish…

844
01:01:45,576 --> 01:01:48,454
he could live peacefully from now on.

845
01:01:52,125 --> 01:01:54,335
I want him to be happy, Mom.

846
01:02:02,969 --> 01:02:07,265
We can be happy without the house, right?

847
01:02:17,775 --> 01:02:19,026
I'm sorry.

848
01:02:27,577 --> 01:02:28,619
(hanging-up beep)

849
01:02:51,851 --> 01:02:53,853
(music fades out)

850
01:03:03,321 --> 01:03:05,281
(song with male vocals playing)

851
01:03:36,646 --> 01:03:38,606
(song continues)
