EPISODE 2

3
00:01:04,939 --> 00:01:07,776
Hey, Dongjin!
Are you really going to do this to me?

4
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:09,319
What has gotten into you?

5
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:10,695
All right.

6
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:13,281
CEO Han,
can I at least park the car myself?

7
00:01:13,364 --> 00:01:16,659
Please? My baby is really shy,
so you can't just park her anywhere…

8
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:18,078
What?

9
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:21,956
Hey! Did you drive my baby on a dirt road?
Hey, there are so many scratches!

10
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:22,874
Huh?

11
00:01:25,835 --> 00:01:26,795
Han Dongjin!

12
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:29,672
Stop calling my name.

13
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:35,345
I'd rather take a pay cut!
I wouldn't sell my baby over my dead body!

14
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:39,182
Okay then. You'll get a smaller paycheck,
starting this month.

15
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:40,183
What…

16
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:42,894
You cruel brat!

101 YEARS OF TAERANG

18
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:45,647
So,

19
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:49,400
you're living comfortably.

20
00:01:53,738 --> 00:01:56,908
BEST FAIR
CEO HAN DONGJIN

21
00:02:10,004 --> 00:02:12,799
You have a lot of experience.
And your age is up there.

22
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:15,677
I thought there wasn't an age restriction.

23
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:17,345
That is true, but…

24
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:20,056
I'm a fast learner.

25
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:22,058
Just one week.

26
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:25,562
No, two days is all you need
to find out whether I'm worth it or not.

27
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:28,857
If I don't earn my keep,
go ahead and fire me right away.

28
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:30,942
I really

29
00:02:32,026 --> 00:02:33,528
want to work here.

30
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:38,116
Come in.

31
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:47,041
Mr. Han, this is our new
part-time office assistant.

32
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:48,459
She'll be starting tomorrow.

33
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:51,963
Looking forward to working with you.

34
00:02:52,463 --> 00:02:53,298
Me too.

35
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:14,777
I also look forward to working with you.

36
00:03:16,654 --> 00:03:17,488
Sure.

37
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:35,089
Do you know her?

38
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:39,719
Yes.

39
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:41,512
Oh, so you do know her.

40
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:44,766
I mean, she's really not hiding that well.

41
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:11,978
It's apartment 2701.

42
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:18,067
If you're looking for my place,

43
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:20,737
it's apartment 2701.

44
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:37,337
When did you figure it out?

45
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:40,340
Before I went inside
the convenience store.

46
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:41,299
Why did you follow me?

47
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:47,764
Ms. Sim Woojoo.

48
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:50,516
Okay, fine. I'll tell you.

49
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:56,314
A woman secretly follows a man home.
Why would she do that?

50
00:05:58,816 --> 00:06:01,110
I have a lot of interest in you.

51
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:02,403
Quite a lot.

52
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:10,328
-It may sound like a romantic confession…
-I didn't take it like that.

53
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:13,164
The look on your face.

54
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:15,625
There was no romance.

55
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:17,335
You looked like you wanted to fight.

56
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:24,425
If you want to talk, let's talk tomorrow.

57
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:38,606
Aren't you leaving?

58
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:42,693
Yes, I'm going to.

59
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:45,863
But I like to finish things on the spot.

60
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:49,117
Anyway, sorry about stalking you.

61
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:50,952
Sure.

62
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:54,539
But are you normally this petty?

63
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,668
You knew all along
but wanted to see how far I'd go.

64
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:00,753
Pretending not to know, to let it go.

65
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:04,424
Then coming at me when I had no way out.

66
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:06,175
That's really petty, you know.

67
00:07:07,718 --> 00:07:08,886
Why did you even pretend?

68
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:11,431
When you were never going to let it slide.

69
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,480
I let it slide for you.

70
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,358
I pretended not to know.

71
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:35,496
What, are you mad at me?

72
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:38,833
Well, I'm sorry.

73
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:43,171
When I panic, I tend to get aggressive,
so I was out of line.

74
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:50,386
So are you renting your place?
Or do you own it?

75
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:56,184
I'm looking to move and wanted to know
what the market is like these days.

76
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:00,313
Ms. Sim Woojoo.

77
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:05,485
No one at work asks me
any personal questions.

78
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:09,489
I didn't know that. But why?

79
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:12,200
Because I don't ask those questions.

80
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:15,953
Whatever interest you have in me,

81
00:08:16,954 --> 00:08:19,040
or what you meant to do
by finding out where I live,

82
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:22,460
I don't care about those things.

83
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,837
So I don't want you
asking me questions, either.

84
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:26,506
So you're telling me to shut up.

85
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:31,719
I thought you were soft, but it looks like
you have at least some nerve.

86
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:33,846
And you have a lot of secrets as well.

87
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:48,110
You don't have to give me that look.

88
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:50,530
I'm leaving.

89
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:55,701
Be sure to lock your doors
before you sleep.

90
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:58,871
Thieves come when you least expect them.

91
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:15,346
KU YOUNGMIN CARD
HAN DONGJIN

92
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:48,462
Who is it?

93
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:57,722
Ms. Sim Woojoo?

94
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:12,778
-Do you have some rice?
-Uh-huh.

95
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:18,159
Woojoo.

96
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:22,413
I'm not trying to be stingy
with my ramyeon and rice.

97
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:25,708
But this is your third serving,
in like three minutes.

98
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:29,211
Are you preparing for some competition?

99
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:39,597
Your stomach is going to explode
if you eat that much.

100
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,352
Well, this brings me back.

101
00:10:44,935 --> 00:10:46,646
The day you decided not
to apply for college,

102
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:48,981
you ate five portions of tteokbokki

103
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:52,568
with all the fritters, sundae,
and kimmari that morning.

104
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:00,868
-Thank you for the food.
-My pleasure, see you.

105
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:06,332
Ma'am, two more portions
of tteokbokki here, please.

106
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,000
Okay.

107
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:12,588
Why did you bring your bow?

108
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,007
Are you getting back into archery?

109
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:19,428
Well, explain yourself, then.

110
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:22,973
Why are you suddenly giving up on college?

111
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:26,977
I've been playing sports my entire life.
What's the point of going to college?

112
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:28,437
I'll just get a job.

113
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,273
Then why did you study so hard?

114
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:38,406
Well, I just thought I'd try.
Since it's my senior year and all.

115
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:42,159
Just call your dad.

116
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:45,121
If you tell him about your mom being sick…

117
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:46,580
Hey! Yoon Jun!

118
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:48,624
I know it's because of money.

119
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,001
He wouldn't want you
to stop at high school…

120
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:59,260
My dad fell for another woman
and took all the money and left.

121
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:02,263
So I don't really have a dad.

122
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:05,391
I'll take care of my mom.

123
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:15,317
-I'm sorry.
-If you are,

124
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:17,528
get me more sundae.

125
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:21,240
-Ma'am!
-Yes.

126
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:24,034
One more order of sundae,
and shaved ice, please.

127
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:24,952
Okay.

128
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:38,382
I'm giving you a really good deal.
You know that, right?

129
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:40,176
Just give me your bow.

130
00:12:57,568 --> 00:12:58,694
Here.

131
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:05,534
I have to go.

132
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:16,504
Hey, the shaved ice is melting…

133
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:19,632
Are you crying?

134
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,765
That tteokbokki was way too spicy.

135
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:31,685
It's too spicy.

136
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:39,568
I'm crying because my tongue is burning.

137
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:42,571
I just want you to know that.

138
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:56,961
I'm going home.

139
00:13:57,127 --> 00:13:58,629
Okay, take care.

140
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:45,509
I'm sure there was ice cream here…

141
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:48,846
I ate that.

142
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:50,055
You startled me.

143
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:54,852
What are you doing here?
You weren't in your room?

144
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:59,607
Does this place give off good energy?
I just had a very nice dream.

145
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:03,527
Go sleep in your room.
You should be more careful.

146
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:07,406
In my dream, they announced that
they were going to develop a new sensor.

147
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:10,159
When any married men,
men with girlfriends,

148
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:12,912
or men who've cheated
in the past approach you,

149
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:16,874
this sensor will activate
and turn them into black and white.

150
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:20,753
The men I should avoid
will automatically become colorless.

151
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:23,547
At last, a new age
of peaceful romance will begin.

152
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:24,924
Wouldn't that be awesome?

153
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:32,473
When that happens,
I can finally date to my heart's content.

154
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:27,486
About that house over there.
It looks like someone did move in,

155
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:28,904
but no one's been seen in it.

156
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:32,449
Maybe it's not a person
but some wretched ghost that moved in.

157
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:34,201
What's that?
You know something, don't you?

158
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:36,954
Goodness, I only feel sorry
for the three siblings who got kicked out.

159
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:39,915
I loved seeing those kids
making an honest living.

160
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:43,961
-So who moved in that house now?
-I don't know.

161
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:47,214
34, YEONHUI-RO 27 RA-GIL

162
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:56,682
Heeja, I heard you moved.
Aren't you throwing a housewarming party?

163
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,853
I moved from the south
to the north of the river.

164
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:03,397
What is there to throw a party for?

165
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:05,315
What are you talking about?

166
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:08,277
Your move is the talk of the town
among our former classmates.

167
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:10,487
What are they saying?

168
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:13,490
The house you moved into
is soon going to be redeveloped.

169
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:15,743
Isn't that why you moved there?

170
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:21,123
As always, it's always the news of someone
getting rich that travels the fastest.

171
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:26,128
Okay. I'll pick up the check for today.

172
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:29,590
But, where did you get the money
to buy that house?

173
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:32,634
I heard at the funeral
that you invested all the money

174
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,887
you made from selling the house
into your son's company.

175
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:37,556
Or did you take money from your son?

176
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:39,349
Hey! Yang Chunja!

177
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:45,564
Why are you so nosy
about other people's affairs?

178
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:50,903
Try hiking instead of wasting your energy
and time on things like that.

179
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:54,490
Also, do you think
I'm some kind of thug? A gangster?

180
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:57,409
Take whose money?

181
00:17:57,493 --> 00:18:03,540
I'm sick and tired of people saying
I took something from someone.

182
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:17,888
Smart housewife shoppers,
zucchinis are two for 1,000 won.

183
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:20,432
Oh, that's a good deal.

184
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:26,313
Smart housewife shoppers,
cucumbers are two for 1,000 won.

185
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:27,481
Yes, it is a good deal.

186
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:39,535
Smart housewife shoppers,
napa cabbage is 1,400 won today only.

187
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:57,094
Smart housewife shoppers, small radishes
are 3,000 won if you get them now.

188
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:02,641
-Sir.
-Yes?

189
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:05,060
-I'm just a smart shopper.
-Pardon?

190
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:08,647
I'm not a smart housewife shopper.
I'm just a smart shopper.

191
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:10,983
Not all women
getting groceries are housewives.

192
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:16,530
I apologize.

193
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:36,800
Do you live near here?

194
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:39,178
What, do you think
I would have stalked you

195
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:40,971
to a grocery store
this early in the morning?

196
00:19:41,638 --> 00:19:45,184
I moved here recently
because I got kicked out of my house.

197
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:51,982
I've lived there for 20 years,
and I got kicked out of there in two days.

198
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:54,735
Isn't that messed up?

199
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:02,451
You don't seem interested.
Don't care about other people's business?

200
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:05,913
Aren't you curious about the backstory?

201
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:09,499
If you ask now, I'll tell you everything.

202
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:13,670
Along with how I plan
on getting the house back.

203
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:21,887
I'm not interested
in other people's misery.

204
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:23,513
That will be 39,800 won.

205
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:34,775
That's what I thought.

206
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:39,821
I knew you wouldn't be interested.

207
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:44,701
Go ahead.

208
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:47,287
You and I are headed
in different directions.

209
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:26,868
PLANNING TEAM
SIM WOOJOO

210
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:51,226
What are you doing over there?

211
00:21:57,858 --> 00:21:59,067
I was looking for cups to wash.

212
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:02,154
I told you. There's no need
to go into the CEO's office.

213
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:15,959
And Woojoo.

214
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:18,920
Don't come to work so early.

215
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:21,548
You only have to work
for the hours you're paid.

216
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:23,925
Showing up at seven is a little much.

217
00:22:24,634 --> 00:22:26,094
Please don't take it the wrong way.

218
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:36,605
START

219
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:45,489
Did you hear?
The guy who screwed our company over

220
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:46,948
regarding the Singapore exhibition.

221
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:50,160
It was CEO Shin.

222
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:52,662
Yuri, did you just find that out?
We already knew.

223
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:56,541
Who else would try to screw over Mr. Han
in this field if not CEO Shin?

224
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:02,464
But why is he so hell-bent
on trying to ruin our kindhearted Mr. Han?

225
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:05,759
Is it really because all the old employees
left CEO Shin and moved here en masse?

226
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:09,554
That's what I thought, but
it turns out there are other rumors too.

227
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:11,681
There's a rumor
he took all the key business documents

228
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:14,684
-from Shin's company when he left.
-Wasn't it because of money?

229
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:18,480
I heard that our two co-CEOs
embezzled that company's money.

230
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:20,982
What's Mr. Han's true nature?

231
00:23:21,858 --> 00:23:24,111
Seriously, I'm getting goosebumps.

232
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,334
I'll wash mine, don't worry.

233
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:42,170
Set it down. I'll do it.

234
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:44,589
-What?
-Or not.

235
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:45,924
Well…

236
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:50,595
I'm just surprised. Anyway, thank you.

237
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:53,181
By the way…

238
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:57,644
Who is CEO Shin? What company is he from?

239
00:23:58,895 --> 00:23:59,855
Shinwoo Fair.

240
00:24:00,897 --> 00:24:02,149
Why do you ask?

241
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:06,445
They say knowledge is power.
So I just wanted to know.

242
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:08,405
Whatever.

243
00:24:18,081 --> 00:24:19,124
Yes, sir.

244
00:24:19,207 --> 00:24:21,418
You know that our fair
will coincide with the season

245
00:24:21,501 --> 00:24:23,545
when new outdoor products
are released, right?

246
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:24,671
Yes.

247
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:27,966
So I think it'd be great if they can be
displayed along with camping gear.

248
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:31,720
Yes, sir. And I can just send you
the brochure to your email address, right?

249
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:35,015
Yes, sir. Okay. Thank you.

250
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:43,106
Gosh. You startled me.

251
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:47,986
What is it?

252
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:51,490
Last week's receipts. They're all missing.

253
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:53,658
Uh, that…

254
00:24:57,954 --> 00:24:59,581
I'll give them to you in the afternoon.

255
00:26:01,434 --> 00:26:02,936
Hey, why aren't you here?

256
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:06,356
-Where?
-I knew you'd say this.

257
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:11,152
Where else? It's your reunion
for the Freshmen Class of '08.

258
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:13,947
-But you're the Freshmen Class of '05.
-Exactly.

259
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:17,826
Why do you think I came all this way
to see my junior classmates?

260
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:24,708
Listen, everyone from your class thinks
our company's gone bankrupt.

261
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:27,711
They even took bets on
whether you'll show up tonight or not.

262
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:33,300
Just come quickly. And grab my baby
from the basement and show up in that.

263
00:26:33,383 --> 00:26:35,510
Put on a nice shirt too.

264
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:39,139
Let's show them we're still in business
and doing well too.

265
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,726
They won't believe us
if they've already made up their minds.

266
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:45,645
Don't just sit there all awkwardly
and get out of there.

267
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:49,941
No, you should stop looking at videos
of people camping like some pervert.

268
00:26:50,358 --> 00:26:52,902
I'll send the address
to your phone. Hurry up and come.

269
00:27:01,578 --> 00:27:03,705
-Classmates stick together!
-Together!

270
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:05,332
…I wouldn't know.

271
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:07,334
-Yeah?
-Yes, just call me anytime.

272
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:08,710
We drank a lot, no?

273
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:10,170
Oh, seriously.

274
00:27:10,253 --> 00:27:11,588
Think about it, what would happen?

275
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:13,214
-Hey!
-That was a lot for today as well…

276
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:15,925
What's the biggest socialite
of our school doing here?

277
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:18,845
Why are you sitting there in the corner?

278
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:23,016
I don't want to be a senior who ruins
my junior class's get-together.

279
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:24,142
Well, that is kind of true.

280
00:27:24,225 --> 00:27:28,188
Man, when you walked in here earlier,
I thought you were some celebrity.

281
00:27:28,271 --> 00:27:31,316
You did?
Well, I tried to look nice today.

282
00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:32,400
No, not that.

283
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:36,154
Why are you here with us? It's so random.

284
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:40,116
I think he's drunk…

285
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:42,619
Sunwoo, please try to understand.

286
00:27:42,702 --> 00:27:45,080
He just recently got dumped
by the girl he was going to marry,

287
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:46,414
so he's kind of lost it.

288
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:50,085
Hey, how many times
did I tell you? I wasn't dumped.

289
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:52,712
Why is that even important?

290
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:55,256
What's important is that
you're now single.

291
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,633
-So, Sunwoo.
-Yes?

292
00:27:56,716 --> 00:27:58,551
Why did Dongjin and Minyoung break up?

293
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:01,221
Come on, there he goes again.

294
00:28:01,304 --> 00:28:03,014
What? Am I the only one who's curious?

295
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:04,391
Am I the only scumbag here?

296
00:28:04,974 --> 00:28:06,601
Hey, Changsoo. You said so yourself!

297
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:09,771
That they broke up because Minyoung's
wealthy family disapproved of them dating.

298
00:28:10,271 --> 00:28:13,525
Well, no. That was just my theory.

299
00:28:13,608 --> 00:28:14,609
See?

300
00:28:15,568 --> 00:28:18,571
Hey, make sure you eat something too.

301
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:21,491
Drinking beer on an empty stomach
will knock you out.

302
00:28:21,574 --> 00:28:24,661
Come on, you don't know either, right?
That's why you can't say anything.

303
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:27,080
What do you mean I don't know?

304
00:28:27,163 --> 00:28:29,040
I'm the one who hooked them up.

305
00:28:29,624 --> 00:28:32,001
Okay, so tell us then.
Why did they break up?

306
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:34,379
Why are you so curious about it?

307
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:36,256
Ask me.

308
00:28:38,591 --> 00:28:39,426
Welcome.

309
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:48,643
Dude, you're still just as nosy
about people's love affairs as before.

310
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:50,687
Hey, man.

311
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:54,149
Dongjin. It's been a long time.

312
00:28:55,358 --> 00:28:57,026
Hey, where's the wedding invitation?

313
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:01,990
It's been called off.

314
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:09,497
Minyoung went to the States
to study some more.

315
00:29:09,706 --> 00:29:10,540
I see.

316
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:12,250
That's why you broke up?

317
00:29:13,376 --> 00:29:14,377
Yes.

318
00:29:15,545 --> 00:29:17,589
Right,
long-distance relationships are hard.

319
00:29:17,672 --> 00:29:19,424
And you can always find someone else.

320
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:23,094
How's your kid?
Has she had her first birthday yet?

321
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:26,514
Yes. She's three now.
Do you want to see a picture?

322
00:29:27,056 --> 00:29:30,393
-Ta-da. Isn't she pretty?
-Yes, she is.

323
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:32,812
Let's feast!

324
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:35,565
-Let's feast!
-And die!

325
00:29:35,648 --> 00:29:36,566
Drink up!

326
00:29:36,649 --> 00:29:38,651
Drink up!

327
00:29:38,735 --> 00:29:40,028
You're still so cool.

328
00:29:44,073 --> 00:29:46,743
-Hey, how are you doing these days?
-I'm doing well.

329
00:29:46,826 --> 00:29:48,077
-You are?
-How did you come here?

330
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:50,163
-You've gotten even prettier.
-Oh?

331
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:58,254
Are you leaving already?

332
00:29:59,255 --> 00:30:01,341
Yes, I have a lot of work to do tomorrow.

333
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:03,927
Your daughter looks cute.
She must take after her mom.

334
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:07,722
It's been like five years
since I heard you crack a joke.

335
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:09,849
-I wasn't joking.
-What?

336
00:30:12,268 --> 00:30:14,145
Go on before they come outside.

337
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:15,814
You might have to stay if they catch you.

338
00:30:16,856 --> 00:30:18,525
See you around, I'll call you.

339
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:20,944
Hey, Dongjin.

340
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:24,656
I recently ran into Minyoung.

341
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:27,158
She came back
to Korea for good, apparently.

342
00:30:30,787 --> 00:30:33,706
It was kind of odd that she asked me
not to tell anyone, not even Sunwoo.

343
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:36,000
Did something happen between you two?

344
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:44,968
I think we should stop seeing each other.

345
00:30:48,888 --> 00:30:49,973
I'm really sorry,

346
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:53,852
but that's how things are.

347
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:14,873
You mean next week?

348
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:16,875
Yeah, next week sounds good.

349
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:19,836
Oh, stop that.

350
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:37,979
I don't think I can go camping
with you next week. Something came up.

351
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,448
Are you listening?

352
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:50,658
Yes.

353
00:31:57,332 --> 00:31:58,708
Don't go all alone again.

354
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:01,210
Take Sunwoo with you.

355
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:06,382
Packing and unpacking,

356
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:09,385
why do you
go through this hassle every week?

357
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:17,810
You said you liked it.

358
00:32:22,815 --> 00:32:23,983
You liked it before too.

359
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:29,739
I liked it then.

360
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:00,848
He's gone now.

361
00:35:40,012 --> 00:35:41,848
Door unlocked.

362
00:36:16,799 --> 00:36:19,677
KANG MINSOO

363
00:36:39,071 --> 00:36:40,281
Delivery!

364
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:51,667
What? Why is it you today?

365
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:56,088
I'm the morning angel. My wings
were too big, so I left them at home.

366
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:57,298
Hmm…

367
00:36:57,590 --> 00:37:00,051
You should have left something else home
instead of your wings.

368
00:37:00,801 --> 00:37:03,179
Why, do I still have
some beauty left on me?

369
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:07,391
-Your eye gunk.
-Uh, sorry.

370
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:08,851
It's really wedged in there.

371
00:37:09,268 --> 00:37:10,311
Where is it?

372
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:11,604
Here?

373
00:37:11,979 --> 00:37:12,980
Let me.

374
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:27,578
Listen here.

375
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:31,540
No matter how close we are,
we should at least wash our faces

376
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:34,210
before seeing each other.
You know that, right?

377
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:37,964
What? Why is that?

378
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:41,592
Because we're not family. We're not
actually family but acquaintances.

379
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:44,011
Even if we've known
each other for over ten years,

380
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:45,263
let's have some basic manners.

381
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:52,979
I guess I should have
at least brushed my teeth.

382
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:09,161
-Thank you for the food.
-Yes.

383
00:38:12,164 --> 00:38:13,124
Ugh, it's so salty.

384
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:15,251
Did you make this?

385
00:38:15,334 --> 00:38:16,210
Yeah.

386
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:18,754
It was you.

387
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:20,840
There's something
you may not know about me.

388
00:38:20,923 --> 00:38:22,925
I can't even make ramyeon properly.

389
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:25,970
-No, come on.
-It's sad but true.

390
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:28,639
Then where's the girl
who made this salt soup?

391
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:32,101
I don't know.
She was gone by the time I woke up.

392
00:38:34,603 --> 00:38:38,149
By the way,
isn't Woojoo acting a bit strange lately?

393
00:38:38,232 --> 00:38:39,317
As much as you?

394
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:43,029
That's not good. We need to have
at least one normal person in our family.

395
00:38:44,613 --> 00:38:47,408
Tell me. What about her
seems strange exactly?

396
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:50,786
She went out wearing mismatching shoes.

397
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:53,039
That's it?

398
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:56,500
You don't remember, do you?

399
00:38:57,126 --> 00:39:00,379
Sim Woojoo was wearing
mismatching shoes that day, too.

400
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:03,883
That day? What day?

401
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:06,886
You're right.

402
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:09,138
It was mismatched that day.

403
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:14,727
I'm not entirely sure,
but she's either out of it

404
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:16,937
or has gone crazy just like that day.

405
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:19,857
It has to be one or the other.

406
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:46,717
Let's hurry up and go.

407
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:49,387
All the participating companies
received an email

408
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:52,807
that includes all the information
like prices and contract terms.

409
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:54,642
Explain to them
that different prices were set

410
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:56,310
according to different booth locations.

411
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:57,311
But it seems that

412
00:39:57,395 --> 00:40:00,272
personal memos taken by the sales team
have also been shared.

413
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:08,155
The mass email was sent from
Assistant Manager Kang's email address.

414
00:40:08,989 --> 00:40:10,616
And he says he didn't send it out.

415
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:13,077
Sir, I really don't know
anything about this.

416
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,121
I think someone did this
with malicious intent…

417
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:18,874
Send the laptop
to a forensics company,

418
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:21,043
and Mr. Kang, go wait
in the conference room.

419
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:26,382
INTRODUCING NEW AI / FINGER ARTHRITIS AND
HAND EXPOSURE ISSUES, NO HANDSHAKE

420
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:30,845
People in business usually
take notes like these.

421
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:34,682
Because if you say one wrong thing…

422
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:36,600
…it could let them try
to slash prices with that.

423
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:38,227
DIRECTOR KIM JUHO

424
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:39,770
How did you know about Director Kim?

425
00:40:40,396 --> 00:40:44,900
Well, I happened to overhear
you two talking about it.

426
00:41:16,056 --> 00:41:17,099
I didn't know it was empty.

427
00:41:18,934 --> 00:41:19,977
I didn't say anything.

428
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:30,738
Sir, did Mr. Kang really do that?

429
00:41:32,698 --> 00:41:35,075
If you're not certain,
you should look into it more.

430
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:38,871
What I'm saying is that
the real spy might be someone else.

431
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:56,388
Why isn't anyone saying anything?

432
00:41:57,097 --> 00:42:00,309
Let's grill Assistant Manager Kang
and find out who's behind this!

433
00:42:01,602 --> 00:42:02,937
What if there's no one behind it?

434
00:42:04,146 --> 00:42:08,317
Then do you think
he did all this by himself?

435
00:42:08,484 --> 00:42:09,485
Why?

436
00:42:09,902 --> 00:42:11,403
I mean, for what reason?

437
00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:14,782
Gosh, seriously.

438
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:19,954
I bet my finger that it's 100% CEO Shin.

439
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:23,415
Who else is there other than him
who wants our company to go down?

440
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:26,335
I can't just let this one go.

441
00:42:26,418 --> 00:42:28,921
Let's report Kang to the police
and take legal action.

442
00:42:29,004 --> 00:42:32,383
The forensics company took the laptop,
so let's wait until the results--

443
00:42:32,466 --> 00:42:33,884
Soohee.

444
00:42:34,343 --> 00:42:36,053
Why are we looking into his laptop

445
00:42:36,136 --> 00:42:38,639
when we should be looking
into his bank account?

446
00:42:38,722 --> 00:42:39,974
Gosh, CEO Choi!

447
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:51,068
So…

448
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:53,070
What's Mr. Kang saying?

449
00:42:54,029 --> 00:42:55,030
Nothing, obviously.

450
00:42:55,864 --> 00:42:58,325
But can I just say one thing?

451
00:43:01,078 --> 00:43:02,621
No matter how hard I try and picture it,

452
00:43:02,705 --> 00:43:04,498
I just can't see him
doing something like that.

453
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:07,459
He puts every penny into
his housing subscription savings account

454
00:43:07,543 --> 00:43:09,253
that he's never even
bought a scratch ticket.

455
00:43:10,129 --> 00:43:12,131
He's not cunning enough
to do something so bad.

456
00:43:12,756 --> 00:43:14,508
He has worked under me
for two years already,

457
00:43:14,717 --> 00:43:17,052
and I can vouch for him.
I'm sure it's not him.

458
00:43:17,136 --> 00:43:18,804
You don't know that.

459
00:43:18,887 --> 00:43:20,889
If it was him,
will you take responsibility?

460
00:43:23,726 --> 00:43:26,228
Yes, I'll take full responsibility
and resign.

461
00:43:27,646 --> 00:43:30,024
I've been on the sales team
for over 13 years.

462
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:32,484
If I'm that bad at judging character,
I should quit this job.

463
00:43:33,402 --> 00:43:34,612
Let's wrap it up.

464
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:37,031
Wait. Wrap what up?

465
00:43:37,656 --> 00:43:39,533
If we acknowledge our mistake

466
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:43,287
and offer a 5% discount
to all the booths, they'll quiet down.

467
00:43:44,955 --> 00:43:46,248
Also, Mr. Cha.

468
00:43:46,332 --> 00:43:47,458
Yes, sir.

469
00:43:47,541 --> 00:43:49,001
It's only two years.

470
00:43:50,252 --> 00:43:53,380
When finding out whether
someone would betray you or not,

471
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:55,507
two years isn't a long time.

472
00:43:56,091 --> 00:43:57,051
It's not that long.

473
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:02,931
Mr. Kang! Please just talk
to her alone during lunch.

474
00:44:03,015 --> 00:44:04,350
Ms. Kim, don't try to stop me.

475
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:05,726
But…

476
00:44:06,602 --> 00:44:08,395
Listen. We need to talk.

477
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:09,521
One moment, please.

478
00:44:14,109 --> 00:44:15,319
I said we need to talk.

479
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:17,446
Come with me.

480
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:26,914
Go ahead.

481
00:44:27,539 --> 00:44:29,166
What did you do last night?

482
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:31,835
Why should I tell you that?

483
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:33,629
Then let me be more specific.

484
00:44:34,129 --> 00:44:37,925
Why were you in the office when that email
was sent out from my laptop?

485
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:40,969
Ms. Kim here saw you last night.

486
00:44:42,554 --> 00:44:46,600
I think I drank a little too much.

487
00:44:47,142 --> 00:44:49,937
I should have gone home,
but instead, I came back to the office…

488
00:44:51,647 --> 00:44:54,566
What? Woojoo?

489
00:44:56,402 --> 00:44:57,486
It's Woojoo.

490
00:44:58,362 --> 00:44:59,738
How much did they pay you for this?

491
00:45:02,491 --> 00:45:05,828
You're certain I was paid?
How much? From whom?

492
00:45:07,287 --> 00:45:08,205
Ms. Kim.

493
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:11,834
Did you see me send out
that email from Mr. Kang's desk?

494
00:45:13,585 --> 00:45:18,132
You didn't even go to college.
You're the only one that wouldn't matter

495
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:20,634
if you got caught
after doing something like this!

496
00:45:20,718 --> 00:45:23,303
What brilliant university did you go to
that you accuse me like this

497
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:24,471
with no evidence?

498
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:26,473
Even if you've attended
the most elite university,

499
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:27,933
you're the fool here. Got it?

500
00:45:28,016 --> 00:45:30,102
You know my laptop password.

501
00:45:30,185 --> 00:45:31,770
You saw me type it in!

502
00:45:31,854 --> 00:45:33,856
Yes, sir. Okay. Thank you.

503
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:41,989
Gosh. You startled me.

504
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:53,876
Where do you think you're going?
Go tell them that you're the spy.

505
00:45:54,626 --> 00:45:57,129
It's not me. You've got the wrong person!

506
00:45:57,212 --> 00:46:00,048
Then explain yourself.
Why were you at the office last night?

507
00:46:00,132 --> 00:46:01,425
Who came into where?

508
00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:13,687
Mr. Kang, Ms. Kim. Come into my office.

509
00:46:14,188 --> 00:46:16,523
Shouldn't we first hear
the part-timer's story too?

510
00:46:17,024 --> 00:46:18,108
For what?

511
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:21,236
Ms. Baek.

512
00:46:22,696 --> 00:46:23,739
Everyone, get back to work.

513
00:46:24,323 --> 00:46:26,408
Planning Team,
gather in the conference room.

514
00:46:39,254 --> 00:46:41,757
Please take these
on time, every day this week.

515
00:46:42,049 --> 00:46:44,218
-Okay.
-Have a nice day.

516
00:46:59,066 --> 00:47:02,319
Excuse me, but do you have a girlfriend
by any chance?

517
00:47:04,238 --> 00:47:06,698
Oh, and drink plenty of water.

518
00:47:07,282 --> 00:47:09,034
That will help
with your bladder infection.

519
00:47:09,117 --> 00:47:10,244
You don't have one?

520
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:19,127
Babe, what took you so long?

521
00:47:19,211 --> 00:47:20,420
I missed you so much.

522
00:47:21,338 --> 00:47:23,173
Me too.

523
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:33,684
Nice timing.

524
00:47:34,643 --> 00:47:36,144
Hey, what do you want for lunch?

525
00:47:36,228 --> 00:47:38,647
I'm getting soupy naengmyeon.
Are you getting spicy naengmyeon?

526
00:47:39,898 --> 00:47:43,819
Before that, get me a cheongsimhwan.

527
00:47:51,243 --> 00:47:53,036
JUN PHARMACY

528
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:57,583
Woojoo, you're a real nutjob.
A master-class nutjob.

529
00:47:57,666 --> 00:48:01,420
I know that. You always remind me
just when I'm about to forget.

530
00:48:03,213 --> 00:48:07,384
Was it your plan all along
to move into my house without a fuss?

531
00:48:09,177 --> 00:48:10,220
Was it?

532
00:48:10,304 --> 00:48:12,389
Am I an accessory in your revenge plot?

533
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:15,976
Your house just happened to be
in the same neighborhood as his place.

534
00:48:16,059 --> 00:48:17,436
That's the same thing!

535
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:22,149
I just went to see him at his office
to ask him to give us back the house,

536
00:48:22,232 --> 00:48:23,400
but he was driving a nice car.

537
00:48:35,287 --> 00:48:39,791
Hey, Han Dongjin! Dongjin!

538
00:48:41,919 --> 00:48:44,379
CEO HAN DONGJIN

539
00:48:44,463 --> 00:48:47,466
And he was living in
the nicest apartment in the neighborhood.

540
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,802
He was doing just fine, living large.

541
00:48:52,054 --> 00:48:53,805
I'm not interested
in other people's misery.

542
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:56,433
So that's when I decided.

543
00:48:56,516 --> 00:48:57,726
To get revenge.

544
00:48:58,226 --> 00:49:00,187
No more, no less.

545
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:02,481
Just give as much pain as I received.

546
00:49:04,733 --> 00:49:07,319
So I found out his address

547
00:49:07,402 --> 00:49:09,529
so I could just take his apartment
if things went south.

548
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:10,822
Hey, Woojoo.

549
00:49:11,323 --> 00:49:13,909
-I'm actually scared of you now.
-But…

550
00:49:15,577 --> 00:49:17,871
I haven't done anything
other than just that.

551
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:20,040
I'm not a spy.

552
00:49:22,459 --> 00:49:24,461
I just copied some files.

553
00:49:24,544 --> 00:49:26,129
In case they would come in handy later.

554
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:31,259
Door unlocked.

555
00:49:43,647 --> 00:49:47,359
The part-timer is the only one in
our office, who knows my laptop password.

556
00:49:48,610 --> 00:49:52,614
She even asked me
what company CEO Shin was running.

557
00:49:56,034 --> 00:50:00,622
It's a sure thing then. The part-timer
and CEO Shin were in on this together.

558
00:50:21,435 --> 00:50:25,397
The deed of our house got
transferred to a total stranger overnight.

559
00:50:27,065 --> 00:50:30,152
I've lived there for 20 years,
and I got kicked out of there in 2 days.

560
00:50:30,902 --> 00:50:32,154
Isn't that messed up?

561
00:50:32,988 --> 00:50:35,782
I also look forward to working with you.

562
00:50:36,366 --> 00:50:37,325
Go ahead.

563
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:40,704
You and I are headed
in different directions.

564
00:50:56,219 --> 00:50:57,304
Ms. Sim Woojoo.

565
00:50:58,597 --> 00:50:59,598
Come with me.

566
00:51:14,863 --> 00:51:15,822
Where are we going?

567
00:51:57,155 --> 00:52:02,202
You have to at least ask me, yell at me,
or say something for me to respond.

568
00:52:09,668 --> 00:52:11,128
This is so frustrating.

569
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:14,756
Or did you already make up your mind?

570
00:52:15,257 --> 00:52:17,759
High school graduate and part-timer
Sim Woojoo is the spy?

571
00:52:18,593 --> 00:52:20,178
I didn't say anything yet.

572
00:52:20,262 --> 00:52:21,972
You don't have to say it with words.

573
00:52:22,055 --> 00:52:24,015
You're saying it
with your attitude right now.

574
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:30,165
What are you doing?

575
00:53:31,499 --> 00:53:33,251
I'm the one who should be asking that.

576
00:53:33,335 --> 00:53:35,212
I have no idea where this is.

577
00:53:36,004 --> 00:53:39,633
If you don't want to explain,
then forget it. I'm not moving an inch.

578
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:42,886
Ms. Sim Woojoo.

579
00:53:43,553 --> 00:53:44,638
Yes.

580
00:53:45,639 --> 00:53:47,098
Do you really not know where this is?

581
00:53:51,686 --> 00:53:53,980
Judging by your look,
I should know where this is.

582
00:53:55,482 --> 00:53:58,360
You know CEO Shin Sungman
of Shinwoo Fair, right?

583
00:54:01,196 --> 00:54:04,824
I've heard of him.
That he's out to ruin your business.

584
00:54:12,874 --> 00:54:13,833
No way…

585
00:54:14,751 --> 00:54:17,212
Is this where that CEO Shin is?

586
00:54:19,756 --> 00:54:23,093
You want to have a face-to-face meeting?
Is that why you brought me here?

587
00:54:23,677 --> 00:54:26,721
-Did you do it?
-Why are you asking me that now?

588
00:54:27,305 --> 00:54:29,140
You should have asked
before getting in the car.

589
00:54:30,809 --> 00:54:32,811
If I said I didn't,
would you even believe me?

590
00:54:32,894 --> 00:54:34,938
So explain to me.

591
00:54:35,063 --> 00:54:36,856
Why you followed me to my place,

592
00:54:37,315 --> 00:54:39,276
and what you were doing
at the office at that time.

593
00:54:47,367 --> 00:54:48,201
It is you.

594
00:54:52,497 --> 00:54:54,040
You'd like me to admit it, wouldn't you?

595
00:54:56,543 --> 00:54:58,545
It'd be less painful to be betrayed
by the part-timer

596
00:54:58,628 --> 00:54:59,963
who's worked for only three months

597
00:55:00,505 --> 00:55:03,049
than to be betrayed
by the people you've trusted for years.

598
00:55:04,342 --> 00:55:05,677
You really are pathetic.

599
00:55:07,178 --> 00:55:08,179
Watch your mouth.

600
00:55:08,263 --> 00:55:09,681
Getting wimpy over things like this.

601
00:55:10,181 --> 00:55:11,891
You've lived your life too comfortably.

602
00:55:26,239 --> 00:55:29,034
Please clear out Ms. Sim Woojoo's desk.
She won't be coming back to work.

603
00:55:33,079 --> 00:55:34,247
Ms. Sim Woojoo.

604
00:55:35,790 --> 00:55:36,666
You're fired.

605
00:55:49,721 --> 00:55:51,723
That's right. No need to look any further.

606
00:55:51,806 --> 00:55:54,726
It's like mother, like son!
I knew all along!

607
00:55:56,436 --> 00:55:57,937
I hope you get a flat tire!

608
00:56:01,316 --> 00:56:03,318
-It was such a hard day at work.
-Wrap it up nicely.

609
00:56:03,401 --> 00:56:04,736
Drinking makes everything better.

610
00:56:04,819 --> 00:56:07,155
It's true, but I still have to
go to work tomorrow.

611
00:56:41,523 --> 00:56:44,776
I told you I didn't like her
from the beginning.

612
00:56:44,859 --> 00:56:47,195
I'm a really good judge of character.

613
00:56:49,572 --> 00:56:52,158
What, are you still upset?

614
00:56:53,118 --> 00:56:54,494
It's not that.

615
00:56:59,791 --> 00:57:01,960
Not a single thing she said was wrong.

616
00:57:02,043 --> 00:57:04,045
It'd be less painful to be betrayed
by the part-timer

617
00:57:04,129 --> 00:57:05,630
who's worked for only three months

618
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:08,716
than to be betrayed
by the people you've trusted for years.

619
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:10,635
You really are pathetic.

620
00:57:11,386 --> 00:57:13,179
It hurt because she was so right.

621
00:57:33,199 --> 00:57:34,409
Excuse me.

622
00:57:35,869 --> 00:57:38,746
Miss, you can't sleep here.

623
00:57:39,998 --> 00:57:43,042
Miss? Excuse me?

624
00:57:44,878 --> 00:57:46,004
Hey, Miss.

625
00:57:59,184 --> 00:58:01,603
You should say hello
when you see someone.

626
00:58:02,562 --> 00:58:04,355
You have no manners.

627
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:14,991
Are you drunk?

628
00:58:16,576 --> 00:58:17,410
Listen.

629
00:58:19,412 --> 00:58:21,498
I'm saying this because I'm drunk,

630
00:58:21,915 --> 00:58:23,958
but listen carefully
because I won't say it again.

631
00:58:26,211 --> 00:58:27,378
I…

632
00:58:30,298 --> 00:58:31,466
am not the spy.

633
00:58:36,971 --> 00:58:40,808
I can't say I've lived
the most righteous and pristine life,

634
00:58:42,185 --> 00:58:44,187
but I'm not so easy
that you can manipulate me

635
00:58:44,270 --> 00:58:46,189
into doing something like that for money.

636
00:58:53,196 --> 00:58:55,740
I wasn't going to tell you all of this,

637
00:58:57,617 --> 00:59:01,204
but you really don't have any clue.

638
00:59:02,622 --> 00:59:04,040
That's why you won't be successful.

639
00:59:04,123 --> 00:59:05,750
It's pretty obvious.

640
00:59:11,631 --> 00:59:14,259
Don't say hi even when you
happen to see me around.

641
00:59:17,136 --> 00:59:18,805
Break a leg.

642
00:59:50,753 --> 00:59:54,924
Woojoo, you do know I'm preparing
for the public service exam, right?

643
00:59:56,217 --> 00:59:58,052
I'll bake you some fish tomorrow morning.

644
01:00:03,474 --> 01:00:08,271
All right. Then this public student
will go back to studying.

645
01:00:08,813 --> 01:00:09,897
Good luck.

646
01:00:20,408 --> 01:00:21,451
Hey…

647
01:00:23,369 --> 01:00:25,496
You can't just drop
a bombshell like that about revenge,

648
01:00:25,580 --> 01:00:26,914
and then turn off your phone.

649
01:00:27,874 --> 01:00:30,668
I drank a lot
so I could be bedridden for two days,

650
01:00:30,752 --> 01:00:32,462
but I'm just so sober it's frustrating.

651
01:00:32,545 --> 01:00:34,464
Don't change the topic.

652
01:00:36,633 --> 01:00:37,800
It's over.

653
01:00:42,347 --> 01:00:45,183
I got fired.
They told me not to come back.

654
01:00:46,142 --> 01:00:47,435
Damn the stupid revenge.

655
01:00:48,144 --> 01:00:49,437
It's all over.

656
01:01:01,491 --> 01:01:02,450
You're okay, right?

657
01:01:08,247 --> 01:01:09,832
What are you thinking right now?

658
01:01:10,792 --> 01:01:11,709
Just…

659
01:01:14,128 --> 01:01:19,384
Perhaps nothing ever works out
for someone as unlucky as me.

660
01:01:21,678 --> 01:01:23,763
Was it that I was unlucky?

661
01:01:24,722 --> 01:01:27,433
Or was that guy just incredibly lucky?

662
01:01:29,602 --> 01:01:31,521
I wish it was the latter.

663
01:01:31,854 --> 01:01:34,649
Then I think it would feel less unfair.

664
01:01:58,131 --> 01:02:01,968
I can't say I've lived
the most righteous and pristine life,

665
01:02:03,386 --> 01:02:05,263
but I'm not so easy
that you can manipulate me

666
01:02:05,346 --> 01:02:07,682
into doing something like that for money.

667
01:02:07,765 --> 01:02:09,767
TAERANG BUILDING

668
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:24,991
It's right here.

669
01:02:25,074 --> 01:02:29,120
It was 11:17 p.m., 271Y 5289.

670
01:03:03,404 --> 01:03:04,238
271Y 5289

671
01:03:05,823 --> 01:03:07,909
271Y 5289

672
01:03:33,309 --> 01:03:35,144
CAMPING FAIR CONTRACT INFORMATION,
PLEASE CHECK THE ATTACHED FILE

673
01:03:45,863 --> 01:03:47,281
I'm sure it's not him.

674
01:03:50,159 --> 01:03:51,994
I'll take full responsibility and resign.

675
01:03:55,832 --> 01:03:58,167
If I'm that bad at judging character,
I should quit this job.

676
01:04:06,551 --> 01:04:09,136
Instead of dividing up the hall by items,

677
01:04:09,220 --> 01:04:11,013
I'm thinking it'd be good to display them

678
01:04:11,097 --> 01:04:14,350
in different camping themes to make us
stand out from typical trade exhibitions.

679
01:04:14,517 --> 01:04:17,228
-Mm.
-And this is a B2C-centric fair,

680
01:04:17,311 --> 01:04:20,314
so I'll set up the booths to minimize
the amount of movement of the visitors.

681
01:04:23,901 --> 01:04:25,069
Mr. Han?

682
01:04:32,952 --> 01:04:33,870
Yes.

683
01:04:33,953 --> 01:04:36,414
About the contract
with Director Kim Juho at Jet Camping…

684
01:04:36,497 --> 01:04:38,499
Ms. Baek, let me contact him again.

685
01:04:38,583 --> 01:04:39,458
Forget it.

686
01:04:41,836 --> 01:04:43,045
Are you doing it yourself?

687
01:04:44,255 --> 01:04:47,174
Ms. Baek. You have Ms. Sim's resume,
right?

688
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:49,760
-Yes, sir.
-Please get it for me.

689
01:04:54,307 --> 01:04:55,308
Where are you going?

690
01:05:07,820 --> 01:05:09,071
This is Han Dongjin.

691
01:05:12,033 --> 01:05:12,992
Let's meet up.

692
01:05:47,485 --> 01:05:49,737
RESUME
NAME: SIM WOOJOO

693
01:05:49,820 --> 01:05:53,908
"Honestly, I didn't have any idea
what this company did."

694
01:05:54,867 --> 01:05:57,286
"I saw the word 'exhibition' and thought

695
01:05:57,370 --> 01:06:00,081
it was a company founded
by Kim Dongryul and Lee Juk,

696
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:03,542
but it turns out it was a company
that organizes trade fairs."

697
01:06:03,793 --> 01:06:08,214
"I was excited to meet some celebrities,
but I was quickly disappointed."

698
01:06:15,096 --> 01:06:19,934
I grew up in a house with a front yard

699
01:06:20,434 --> 01:06:24,105
where magnolias bloom in the spring

700
01:06:24,188 --> 01:06:26,649
and a ginkgo tree
that turns yellow in the fall.

701
01:06:27,566 --> 01:06:29,777
I'm late, I'll be off!

702
01:06:32,530 --> 01:06:33,364
Woojoo!

703
01:06:33,614 --> 01:06:34,699
What?

704
01:06:34,865 --> 01:06:37,410
-You forgot your gym clothes.
-Right, I forgot. Okay, bye.

705
01:06:37,493 --> 01:06:38,953
Come here real quick, Woojoo.

706
01:06:40,621 --> 01:06:43,457
-Oh, don't do that.
-Have a good day.

707
01:06:43,541 --> 01:06:44,709
All right.

708
01:06:49,547 --> 01:06:54,343
I think I lived what you might
call a happy life until I was 17.

709
01:06:57,054 --> 01:06:59,640
You see, I always wore
freshly ironed clothes until then.

710
01:07:02,351 --> 01:07:06,689
It meant I could afford to care
whether my clothes had wrinkles or not.

711
01:07:16,532 --> 01:07:18,576
Of course, once I learned
that stiffly pressed clothes

712
01:07:18,659 --> 01:07:20,578
are not very comfortable while working,

713
01:07:20,661 --> 01:07:23,247
I stopped doing such unnecessary things.

714
01:07:24,749 --> 01:07:27,626
That's because
I greatly value efficiency while working.

715
01:07:35,134 --> 01:07:38,846
My one drawback is that
I can sound very mean from time to time.

716
01:07:41,724 --> 01:07:43,559
That only happens in two scenarios,

717
01:07:44,351 --> 01:07:47,688
when I either really care about the person
or really hate the person.

718
01:07:50,274 --> 01:07:51,901
I'll be careful not to offend anyone,

719
01:07:51,984 --> 01:07:55,029
but whoever's reading this should
be careful so we can avoid the latter.

720
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:09,502
It was Sales Team Leader Cha Youngmin.

721
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:10,961
He was the real spy.

722
01:08:22,139 --> 01:08:24,850
I'm sorry for speaking rudely that day.

723
01:08:25,684 --> 01:08:26,977
Is that all?

724
01:08:28,062 --> 01:08:29,939
Why did you bring me out here
this late at night?

725
01:08:30,022 --> 01:08:31,107
You could have just called.

726
01:08:34,652 --> 01:08:35,986
I'd like you to come back to work.

727
01:08:39,657 --> 01:08:41,033
I need you, Ms. Sim.

728
01:08:45,079 --> 01:08:46,288
You're going to regret it.

729
01:08:58,300 --> 01:08:59,635
I read your cover letter.

730
01:09:02,847 --> 01:09:06,851
I know I'd look crazy
laughing on a day like this.

731
01:09:13,315 --> 01:09:14,817
But I laughed, thanks to you.

732
01:09:19,864 --> 01:09:21,532
I didn't write that so you could laugh.

733
01:09:23,742 --> 01:09:24,660
Right.

734
01:09:26,579 --> 01:09:27,663
Why did I laugh?

735
01:09:30,416 --> 01:09:31,375
Stop smiling.

736
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:48,100
That little… Hey! Han Dongjin!

737
01:09:48,767 --> 01:09:51,437
Damn bastard, how could you?

738
01:09:52,271 --> 01:09:53,314
You bastard…

739
01:09:53,939 --> 01:09:57,902
Hey, how could you do that to me?

740
01:10:30,017 --> 01:10:31,602
If you pick me for the position,

741
01:10:32,353 --> 01:10:35,606
I'm sure you'll come
to regret it some days.

742
01:10:37,691 --> 01:10:38,692
However…

743
01:10:41,570 --> 01:10:43,739
I'll do my best to make sure
that doesn't happen often.
