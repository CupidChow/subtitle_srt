1
00:00:58,431 --> 00:01:02,935
CALL IT LOVE

2
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:19,326
<i>Do you want to stay here tonight?</i>

3
00:01:52,401 --> 00:01:53,441
Would you like more fruit?

4
00:02:02,078 --> 00:02:03,078
Do you have…

5
00:02:05,623 --> 00:02:06,623
any beer?

6
00:02:12,421 --> 00:02:14,090
Wait here. I'll go get some real quick.

7
00:02:36,112 --> 00:02:38,864
(EPISODE 12)

8
00:02:54,296 --> 00:02:56,096
Why are you calling me
instead of coming home?

9
00:02:56,549 --> 00:02:57,549
What's Mom doing?

10
00:02:57,967 --> 00:02:59,468
She went into her room a while ago.

11
00:03:00,177 --> 00:03:01,929
Is Jun with you?

12
00:03:02,012 --> 00:03:03,222
He went to his family home.

13
00:03:03,681 --> 00:03:05,121
He'll stay there for the time being.

14
00:03:06,142 --> 00:03:10,271
<i>Hey, get some ice cream
on your back, a really sweet one.</i>

15
00:03:11,313 --> 00:03:13,190
<i>I can feel my blood sugar
dropping right now.</i>

16
00:03:13,274 --> 00:03:14,274
Haesung.

17
00:03:19,405 --> 00:03:20,405
Is something wrong?

18
00:03:27,204 --> 00:03:28,956
What? What's going on?

19
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:30,875
I'll come to you right now…

20
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:32,209
I think I'm going to regret it.

21
00:03:33,752 --> 00:03:35,963
I know I'll regret it.

22
00:03:39,633 --> 00:03:41,218
But I want to be here right now.

23
00:03:43,012 --> 00:03:44,555
I want to be with him.

24
00:03:48,851 --> 00:03:51,187
So you're just saying
you're sleeping over.

25
00:03:53,397 --> 00:03:56,150
Why do you have to
sound like you're dying?

26
00:03:56,233 --> 00:03:57,735
You scared me.

27
00:03:59,445 --> 00:04:00,445
My bad.

28
00:04:02,198 --> 00:04:03,324
<i>I'll cover for you.</i>

29
00:04:03,407 --> 00:04:06,410
<i>I'll make something up for Mom
so she doesn't worry.</i>

30
00:04:07,077 --> 00:04:08,579
<i>Just get to work straight from there.</i>

31
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:55,960
I'm in here.

32
00:05:05,177 --> 00:05:07,179
I was most curious about
this room at your place.

33
00:05:20,693 --> 00:05:23,404
It's as if
you're moving out tomorrow.

34
00:05:24,697 --> 00:05:26,073
Your room is basically empty,

35
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:28,951
and so is your fridge.

36
00:05:29,535 --> 00:05:31,036
This isn't really my house,

37
00:05:33,163 --> 00:05:34,443
and I've always wanted to leave.

38
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:37,418
It was my dream once.

39
00:05:38,335 --> 00:05:40,921
If I was broke, I'd go with my tent.

40
00:05:42,423 --> 00:05:43,632
And if I had some money,

41
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:47,344
I'd get a camper
and go away for as long as I could.

42
00:05:50,764 --> 00:05:53,767
But instead, I kind of
stumbled into starting up a company.

43
00:05:55,019 --> 00:05:56,562
And it's always been on thin ice,

44
00:05:58,022 --> 00:05:59,815
always teetering on the edge.

45
00:06:01,108 --> 00:06:04,028
So I figured I'd just run away
if things didn't work out.

46
00:06:04,737 --> 00:06:06,196
I'd at least disappear for a while.

47
00:06:07,531 --> 00:06:08,531
And to do that,

48
00:06:08,991 --> 00:06:11,994
I'd need my fridge to be empty
so that I would feel okay.

49
00:06:14,163 --> 00:06:16,123
How would you ever run away
with your personality?

50
00:06:17,374 --> 00:06:19,293
I bet you can't even keep your phone off.

51
00:06:22,296 --> 00:06:24,006
Have you ever left your phone turned off?

52
00:06:27,885 --> 00:06:28,886
No.

53
00:06:29,261 --> 00:06:30,804
I knew it.

54
00:06:36,352 --> 00:06:37,952
Was there anything else you wanted to do

55
00:06:38,937 --> 00:06:40,564
besides winning a gold medal?

56
00:06:46,987 --> 00:06:49,406
I heard that a Buddhist monk
once told my parents this,

57
00:06:50,366 --> 00:06:52,868
"Your second child will be
the pillar of the household."

58
00:06:54,328 --> 00:06:56,528
"She'd be worth as much as ten sons,
so raise her well."

59
00:06:57,623 --> 00:06:59,666
When I heard that
from my father for the 100th time,

60
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:00,750
I finally realized.

61
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:03,587
I was trying to be
the pillar of our family.

62
00:07:06,882 --> 00:07:08,342
If you ask me what my dreams are…

63
00:07:11,303 --> 00:07:14,515
I'd like my sister to marry someone nice,

64
00:07:16,266 --> 00:07:19,311
and I'd like my little brother
to get a stable job.

65
00:07:25,567 --> 00:07:26,568
That's all.

66
00:07:27,653 --> 00:07:29,413
I haven't really thought
about anything else.

67
00:07:30,656 --> 00:07:31,657
Is that boring?

68
00:07:32,991 --> 00:07:34,118
I'd say you're very kind.

69
00:07:34,952 --> 00:07:37,663
No, we're both stupid.

70
00:07:43,168 --> 00:07:46,380
If I really was kind, I wouldn't be here.

71
00:07:49,174 --> 00:07:52,136
In my head, I'm saying,
"You shouldn't be here. Go home."

72
00:07:53,929 --> 00:07:55,472
When you went out to get the beer,

73
00:07:55,556 --> 00:07:57,236
I was like, "Now is your chance, go home."

74
00:07:59,226 --> 00:08:02,271
But it's all just in my head.
My body won't move.

75
00:08:04,898 --> 00:08:06,608
I like being with you too much.

76
00:08:09,695 --> 00:08:11,071
I…

77
00:08:16,743 --> 00:08:19,204
Really like you a lot, Mr. Han.

78
00:08:23,709 --> 00:08:25,749
To the point where
I wish everyone else in the world

79
00:08:26,336 --> 00:08:29,339
would just disappear
and only the two of us would be left.

80
00:10:42,556 --> 00:10:43,557
<i>In this day and age,</i>

81
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:46,518
<i>a younger sibling getting married
before the older one is no big deal.</i>

82
00:10:47,144 --> 00:10:49,479
Mom, what do you know?

83
00:10:49,563 --> 00:10:51,732
I met him at Jigu's part-time job.

84
00:10:52,441 --> 00:10:54,234
I know she didn't go to work early.

85
00:10:55,152 --> 00:10:56,752
Your mom isn't that old-fashioned, okay?

86
00:10:57,779 --> 00:10:59,031
I did not know that.

87
00:11:00,657 --> 00:11:03,160
I want you to call Jun
on your way to work.

88
00:11:04,328 --> 00:11:06,538
Tell him to come over and get some food.

89
00:11:06,622 --> 00:11:08,022
And that I'm sorry but I'd need him

90
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:10,125
to stay at his parents' for another week.

91
00:11:12,127 --> 00:11:13,420
Are you staying longer?

92
00:11:13,795 --> 00:11:15,714
Are you afraid
I'd want to settle down here?

93
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:17,341
That's not…

94
00:11:18,884 --> 00:11:21,595
The owner of this house is Jun.
Talk to him about it.

95
00:11:26,141 --> 00:11:27,559
Do you have any savings?

96
00:11:27,643 --> 00:11:29,645
I'll lend you some money
so you can find a place.

97
00:11:30,312 --> 00:11:33,607
Unmarried adult men and women
living in the same house is just wrong.

98
00:11:34,858 --> 00:11:37,235
If Jun's parents find out,
things won't be pretty.

99
00:11:38,945 --> 00:11:40,364
You are old-fashioned after all.

100
00:11:44,951 --> 00:11:46,578
Okay, I'll look around.

101
00:11:47,829 --> 00:11:50,624
But don't pack any food for him.

102
00:11:50,707 --> 00:11:53,293
Jun will probably come back in a few days.

103
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,088
Maybe even today.

104
00:11:56,713 --> 00:11:59,216
He can't last long over there.
I know that much.

105
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,968
Oh, that's refreshing.

106
00:12:02,511 --> 00:12:04,137
Did you all sleep well?

107
00:12:07,641 --> 00:12:10,018
<i>I'm leaving early
to stop by my place before going to work.</i>

108
00:12:10,686 --> 00:12:12,366
<i>Have some breakfast
before heading to work.</i>

109
00:14:13,475 --> 00:14:15,060
I have something to tell you.

110
00:14:16,436 --> 00:14:18,355
Could I see you
before you come to the office?

111
00:14:20,774 --> 00:14:21,817
Sit down.

112
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,580
People will think
you're getting yelled at.

113
00:14:26,112 --> 00:14:28,240
Please give me some time.

114
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:35,288
I'm not asking you to let it slide.

115
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:40,377
In order to talk about
why I helped Mr. Cha,

116
00:14:42,087 --> 00:14:44,089
there are just so many things to explain.

117
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:48,218
Like why I started working here,
who I am,

118
00:14:49,761 --> 00:14:51,930
and what I've done.

119
00:14:52,013 --> 00:14:53,515
I have to explain everything.

120
00:14:54,224 --> 00:14:56,768
<i>My mother is my weakness.</i>

121
00:14:57,853 --> 00:14:59,229
A weakness I want to hide

122
00:15:00,105 --> 00:15:01,439
and don't want anyone to spot.

123
00:15:04,609 --> 00:15:05,902
Who exactly are you, Ms. Sim?

124
00:15:07,946 --> 00:15:09,197
Who are you?

125
00:15:12,534 --> 00:15:16,413
It's my fault and my mistake,
so I want to sort it out.

126
00:15:16,496 --> 00:15:17,696
What do you mean, sort it out?

127
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:22,294
Can matters of the heart be sorted out?

128
00:15:24,045 --> 00:15:26,381
You messed up his heart as you pleased.

129
00:15:26,464 --> 00:15:28,508
So what exactly are you going to sort out?

130
00:15:29,968 --> 00:15:32,568
At the very least, I don't want him
to find out from someone else.

131
00:15:33,305 --> 00:15:35,140
I'm going to tell him myself.

132
00:15:35,974 --> 00:15:37,434
That way, he won't be hurt as much.

133
00:15:38,852 --> 00:15:40,228
That's for certain.

134
00:15:45,442 --> 00:15:46,484
Just give me time.

135
00:15:51,656 --> 00:15:53,116
Let's talk after the fair is over.

136
00:15:54,451 --> 00:15:55,952
I'll try to wait as well.

137
00:15:59,331 --> 00:16:01,833
Your contract expires
around that time anyway.

138
00:16:03,668 --> 00:16:04,708
Let's wrap it all up then.

139
00:16:08,715 --> 00:16:10,342
Jeez.

140
00:16:23,396 --> 00:16:26,691
Mr. Choi, the final drafts of the poster
are ready in the conference room.

141
00:16:26,775 --> 00:16:28,276
Okay, I'll be right there.

142
00:16:30,403 --> 00:16:32,197
Woojoo, could you go help Yuri?

143
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,157
I'll be right over
once I let Mr. Han know.

144
00:16:35,533 --> 00:16:36,533
Sure.

145
00:16:45,543 --> 00:16:48,338
It's so exciting to see the final posters.

146
00:16:49,339 --> 00:16:52,676
We're finally hosting the fair.

147
00:16:53,259 --> 00:16:56,096
Now, my portfolio won't
just have proxy work

148
00:16:56,179 --> 00:16:58,515
but an originally planned fair
on it as well.

149
00:16:58,723 --> 00:17:00,725
That made me so emotional.

150
00:17:00,809 --> 00:17:01,810
Congratulations.

151
00:17:01,893 --> 00:17:03,653
Do we have
all the tech support applications?

152
00:17:03,687 --> 00:17:05,998
Yes, I got them from all
the companies that need electrical work.

153
00:17:06,022 --> 00:17:07,691
They look so good.

154
00:17:07,774 --> 00:17:09,526
Which do you like the most, Woojoo?

155
00:17:09,609 --> 00:17:10,777
I think this one's the best.

156
00:17:11,236 --> 00:17:12,529
For me…

157
00:17:31,381 --> 00:17:35,427
CEO Han, pick one.
We have to decide on one by today.

158
00:17:36,011 --> 00:17:40,765
I personally like the third one best.
It's got a good seasonal atmosphere too.

159
00:17:41,224 --> 00:17:42,224
And you, Mr. Han?

160
00:17:44,978 --> 00:17:46,271
Yes, I like the third one too.

161
00:17:46,354 --> 00:17:48,189
It highlights the location and time well.

162
00:17:48,273 --> 00:17:49,149
I like it too.

163
00:17:49,232 --> 00:17:52,360
And it has a festival vibe to it,
so I like this one best.

164
00:18:08,043 --> 00:18:12,422
I felt like a hotel café would be
uncomfortable for both of us.

165
00:18:12,505 --> 00:18:15,266
And I didn't want to make it obvious
that we were having a blind date.

166
00:18:17,635 --> 00:18:20,555
I guess I shouldn't have worn a suit.

167
00:18:21,556 --> 00:18:22,849
It looks nice on you.

168
00:18:36,404 --> 00:18:37,906
So…

169
00:18:39,282 --> 00:18:41,367
Would it be terribly cliché

170
00:18:42,035 --> 00:18:43,745
if I asked you about your hobbies?

171
00:18:45,038 --> 00:18:46,278
It would be a classic question.

172
00:18:48,124 --> 00:18:49,459
I enjoy traveling.

173
00:18:50,043 --> 00:18:51,043
Traveling…

174
00:18:52,253 --> 00:18:53,253
Nice.

175
00:18:53,588 --> 00:18:56,216
Have you ever been to Spain?

176
00:18:56,299 --> 00:18:57,509
No.

177
00:19:03,223 --> 00:19:04,349
How is it there?

178
00:19:06,976 --> 00:19:10,563
In Spain, there's a place called Mallorca.

179
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:17,195
It would be the equivalent
of Jeju Island in Korea.

180
00:19:18,238 --> 00:19:19,239
I also liked Barcelona…

181
00:19:19,322 --> 00:19:21,991
<i>Haesung really hates eating alone.</i>

182
00:19:22,075 --> 00:19:23,868
She says it's embarrassing and awkward.

183
00:19:24,953 --> 00:19:26,913
Maybe I should have gone with her.

184
00:19:26,996 --> 00:19:28,915
No, she said she wanted to eat alone.

185
00:19:28,998 --> 00:19:32,001
She can't possibly be
dating again, can she?

186
00:19:34,212 --> 00:19:35,505
I'm sorry.

187
00:19:35,588 --> 00:19:37,340
Let's not talk like that among ourselves.

188
00:19:38,091 --> 00:19:38,967
Okay.

189
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:40,218
And we won't ask

190
00:19:40,301 --> 00:19:44,389
until Haesung asks first
to eat together, okay?

191
00:19:45,348 --> 00:19:47,725
- Here are your noodles.
- Yes, thank you.

192
00:19:49,853 --> 00:19:51,396
- Sir.
- Yes?

193
00:19:51,479 --> 00:19:52,480
Could we have some water?

194
00:19:54,107 --> 00:19:56,317
<i>Let her spend some time by herself.</i>

195
00:19:56,401 --> 00:19:57,878
30-MINUTE ANIME
WARRIOR IN THE SKY, ANIWARS

196
00:19:57,902 --> 00:20:00,822
<i>She's done enough
empty laughing and chatting</i>

197
00:20:00,905 --> 00:20:02,448
<i>while going through hell.</i>

198
00:20:04,117 --> 00:20:06,244
<i>It's about time she stops doing that.</i>

199
00:21:48,179 --> 00:21:49,472
So…

200
00:21:49,681 --> 00:21:51,391
Shall we go to dinner?

201
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,451
Do you like Japanese food?

202
00:22:11,244 --> 00:22:13,246
I know a really good place nearby.

203
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:15,580
Well…

204
00:22:17,458 --> 00:22:20,586
Can we pretend
that we've already had dinner?

205
00:22:21,212 --> 00:22:22,212
Pardon?

206
00:22:24,299 --> 00:22:25,425
I'm sorry.

207
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:28,052
Oh…

208
00:22:29,387 --> 00:22:31,764
Am I not your type?

209
00:22:32,598 --> 00:22:33,598
No.

210
00:22:34,392 --> 00:22:35,601
No, it's nothing like that.

211
00:22:36,686 --> 00:22:38,604
I don't know how to explain this.

212
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,441
It's just that I'm weird.

213
00:22:42,066 --> 00:22:44,444
I have no idea what to say
while having dinner.

214
00:22:45,278 --> 00:22:47,118
And when I think about that,
I feel suffocated.

215
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:49,740
What?

216
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:56,580
I'm sorry.

217
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:05,715
What a jerk.

218
00:23:10,845 --> 00:23:12,513
Crazy bastard.

219
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:33,534
You drive.

220
00:23:33,618 --> 00:23:35,661
I'm better at drinking
with clients than you are.

221
00:23:35,995 --> 00:23:37,872
Let's do it together.
We can call a cab after.

222
00:23:38,039 --> 00:23:41,334
The magazine company folks
prefer soju, and they drink like whales.

223
00:23:41,459 --> 00:23:42,752
You can't handle them.

224
00:23:45,421 --> 00:23:46,421
Hang on a second.

225
00:23:47,882 --> 00:23:49,342
CEO Han, let's just go.

226
00:23:55,264 --> 00:23:57,624
I have an appointment
so I'll head home straight from there.

227
00:24:03,356 --> 00:24:05,024
Thank you for the breakfast.

228
00:24:05,566 --> 00:24:06,566
I'll call you.

229
00:24:50,862 --> 00:24:53,990
WOOJOO NUTJOB

230
00:24:59,662 --> 00:25:01,038
MOTHER

231
00:25:29,442 --> 00:25:30,442
Ah.

232
00:25:31,277 --> 00:25:32,403
Yoon Jun.

233
00:25:34,989 --> 00:25:36,282
What you have is an illness.

234
00:25:38,326 --> 00:25:40,119
You're the one who's sick.

235
00:25:50,796 --> 00:25:51,923
What are you doing here?

236
00:25:59,305 --> 00:26:01,974
Sighing at my face means
you want me to get lost, right?

237
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:04,268
Should I go?

238
00:26:05,394 --> 00:26:06,687
Do you want me to go?

239
00:26:09,357 --> 00:26:10,357
Sit down.

240
00:26:31,295 --> 00:26:32,588
I went on a blind date today.

241
00:26:34,757 --> 00:26:37,426
And my mom found out about our scheme.

242
00:26:39,595 --> 00:26:41,055
Anyway…

243
00:26:41,639 --> 00:26:44,976
I thought, "What's the big deal?
I'll just go through the motions."

244
00:26:45,476 --> 00:26:47,228
So I just went there.

245
00:26:47,853 --> 00:26:51,524
But every single word
from her mouth suffocated me.

246
00:26:51,941 --> 00:26:55,236
"What do I say
if she asks me what my hobby is?"

247
00:26:55,903 --> 00:26:58,322
"What if she asks me
what my weekend plans are?"

248
00:26:59,615 --> 00:27:01,295
"I hope she doesn't ask me any questions."

249
00:27:01,826 --> 00:27:03,160
That's all I could think about.

250
00:27:05,204 --> 00:27:06,622
It's an illness, you know.

251
00:27:07,915 --> 00:27:09,500
I just can't stand being uncomfortable.

252
00:27:10,418 --> 00:27:11,418
It's gross,

253
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,600
but I guess
I take after my dad, after all.

254
00:27:15,715 --> 00:27:16,924
You're too hard on yourself.

255
00:27:21,262 --> 00:27:22,888
Every time my pharmacy
school friends…

256
00:27:24,181 --> 00:27:26,058
…complained about how difficult it is

257
00:27:26,142 --> 00:27:28,477
to be inside that
tiny matchbox of a pharmacy,

258
00:27:29,061 --> 00:27:30,354
I was like, "What's with them?"

259
00:27:31,063 --> 00:27:32,732
"That's where I'm most comfortable."

260
00:27:34,317 --> 00:27:39,363
And then it's Sim Haesung,
Sim Jigu, and Sim Woojoo next.

261
00:27:43,659 --> 00:27:45,202
I think that's why I went off on you.

262
00:27:47,163 --> 00:27:49,363
I hated the possibility
of being uncomfortable with you.

263
00:27:52,627 --> 00:27:53,711
I'm sorry.

264
00:27:55,129 --> 00:27:56,129
I was out of line.

265
00:28:00,635 --> 00:28:02,875
I'm confused if you're rejecting me
or apologizing to me.

266
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:04,513
What?

267
00:28:04,597 --> 00:28:06,599
How many times
are you going to turn me down?

268
00:28:07,725 --> 00:28:10,645
I understand Korean just fine.
Why beat around the bush so much?

269
00:28:12,772 --> 00:28:14,065
I got it.

270
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,609
I'll keep my heart
from fluttering from now on.

271
00:28:17,401 --> 00:28:18,402
Happy now?

272
00:28:23,741 --> 00:28:25,409
You're killing me, Sim Haesung.

273
00:28:43,636 --> 00:28:48,724
Ms. Baek and I
will be at the fair first.

274
00:28:49,934 --> 00:28:51,894
So wrap things up
and come with the planning team.

275
00:28:53,145 --> 00:28:54,145
Mm-hmm.

276
00:28:55,481 --> 00:28:56,649
Ms. Sim…

277
00:28:58,442 --> 00:29:00,486
will not be going to the fair.

278
00:29:01,278 --> 00:29:04,073
Her contract is up before the fair anyway.

279
00:29:04,573 --> 00:29:06,826
It won't look good
if we force her to come.

280
00:29:07,326 --> 00:29:09,206
She said it herself
that she doesn't want to go.

281
00:29:53,414 --> 00:29:56,959
MR. HAN DONGJIN

282
00:30:59,814 --> 00:31:01,190
I don't drink anymore.

283
00:31:06,821 --> 00:31:07,821
And I'm moving.

284
00:31:10,741 --> 00:31:12,243
I won't be around here anymore.

285
00:31:34,098 --> 00:31:35,933
- Hello.
<i>- Hey, did you get the money?</i>

286
00:31:37,518 --> 00:31:38,727
<i>Excuse me.</i>

287
00:31:39,687 --> 00:31:42,481
Just talk to me right here.
And give me back my stuff.

288
00:31:46,443 --> 00:31:48,763
You know who is living
in the house in Yeonhui-dong, right?

289
00:31:48,821 --> 00:31:52,908
That house was supposed to belong
to the three siblings, your children.

290
00:31:52,992 --> 00:31:54,285
That's how it should be.

291
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:55,744
But things aren't right here.

292
00:31:56,912 --> 00:31:59,582
So if you can come up with
about 30 million won,

293
00:32:00,165 --> 00:32:03,252
I'll tell you how you can
get the house back.

294
00:32:06,255 --> 00:32:07,415
You live with Heeja, correct?

295
00:32:08,841 --> 00:32:11,594
If there's a way to get the house back,
then bring me the solution.

296
00:32:11,677 --> 00:32:13,429
I'll pay you then with interest.

297
00:32:13,512 --> 00:32:15,055
No, wait.

298
00:32:15,139 --> 00:32:17,766
I don't want to hear another word.
I've been fooled once, no more.

299
00:32:18,517 --> 00:32:20,436
Do you people have
even a shred of conscience?

300
00:32:21,103 --> 00:32:23,272
If there is a way to get it back,
I'll find it myself.

301
00:32:23,355 --> 00:32:25,441
I won't need your dirty hands to help me.

302
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:28,402
I'm going off the grid from today.

303
00:32:28,485 --> 00:32:29,486
It's over.

304
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:31,447
I can't get any more money,

305
00:32:31,530 --> 00:32:33,240
so I can't pay off the gambling debt.

306
00:32:34,491 --> 00:32:35,891
What else can I do? I have to hide.

307
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:37,660
Hey.

308
00:32:38,245 --> 00:32:40,331
There's no point if I tell you
where I'll be going.

309
00:32:40,915 --> 00:32:42,249
Don't look for me for a while.

310
00:32:42,875 --> 00:32:43,876
Darn it.

311
00:32:46,879 --> 00:32:48,088
Honey.

312
00:32:48,672 --> 00:32:50,007
I'm home.

313
00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:51,467
Where are you?

314
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:53,135
Are you in the shower?

315
00:32:58,349 --> 00:32:59,850
No.

316
00:32:59,934 --> 00:33:01,435
Darn it!

317
00:33:02,519 --> 00:33:04,647
Seriously!

318
00:33:08,609 --> 00:33:10,152
Hey!

319
00:33:10,235 --> 00:33:11,236
What?

320
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:15,407
Did you really think we'll be parting ways
without going through all this?

321
00:33:15,491 --> 00:33:17,785
What did you just say?

322
00:33:18,827 --> 00:33:21,872
I'm totally broke, and you're broke too
if you don't sell this house.

323
00:33:21,956 --> 00:33:22,956
Then we're finished.

324
00:33:23,374 --> 00:33:25,834
Did you go out with me for money?

325
00:33:26,168 --> 00:33:27,461
Was it all for money?

326
00:33:27,544 --> 00:33:29,213
Then what?

327
00:33:29,296 --> 00:33:30,547
You thought I loved you?

328
00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:32,758
That's gross, snap out of it!

329
00:33:33,425 --> 00:33:36,428
Just go find someone else.
Finding guys is your specialty.

330
00:33:36,887 --> 00:33:38,931
You leave those things here!

331
00:33:39,014 --> 00:33:43,477
I know your resident registration number,
your car license plate number, everything.

332
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:47,481
You're done for
if I report you to the police!

333
00:33:47,856 --> 00:33:48,941
The police?

334
00:33:49,024 --> 00:33:50,359
Sure. Let's go.

335
00:33:50,943 --> 00:33:53,320
You think I don't have anything
to say to them?

336
00:33:53,404 --> 00:33:55,114
Do you want me to go tell them

337
00:33:55,197 --> 00:33:56,991
how you hid your dead husband's will?

338
00:33:58,409 --> 00:34:00,577
How dare you play the victim card?

339
00:34:03,330 --> 00:34:04,540
Think carefully.

340
00:34:05,124 --> 00:34:06,164
Who has more to lose here?

341
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:07,835
Wait.

342
00:34:07,918 --> 00:34:08,919
Hey!

343
00:34:10,129 --> 00:34:12,673
Don't take anything with you.
Leave those things here!

344
00:34:12,756 --> 00:34:14,508
You jerk!

345
00:34:16,051 --> 00:34:17,344
Why should I do that?

346
00:34:17,970 --> 00:34:19,054
Damn it!

347
00:34:25,102 --> 00:34:27,229
Kang Namil!

348
00:34:55,007 --> 00:34:56,007
Mom.

349
00:34:57,718 --> 00:34:59,303
I only have this one suit.

350
00:34:59,386 --> 00:35:01,430
Woojoo bought it for me
to wear to job interviews.

351
00:35:07,186 --> 00:35:09,605
I'll just need to iron out the shirt.

352
00:35:13,901 --> 00:35:14,901
What's this?

353
00:35:15,736 --> 00:35:16,856
Are you two going somewhere?

354
00:35:17,529 --> 00:35:18,697
I have no idea.

355
00:35:19,698 --> 00:35:21,458
I'll tell you
when all three of you are here.

356
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:23,150
I don't want to repeat myself.

357
00:35:29,958 --> 00:35:31,126
What's with the suit?

358
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:33,754
I'm taking Jigu to see your aunt.

359
00:35:33,837 --> 00:35:36,340
That tough aunt with the hair salon?

360
00:35:36,423 --> 00:35:37,883
Some guy came to see me.

361
00:35:38,759 --> 00:35:40,886
He says there is a way
to get the house back.

362
00:35:43,055 --> 00:35:44,723
Shortly after buying that house…

363
00:35:45,974 --> 00:35:49,937
your father said this as he planted
the tree and grass in the front yard.

364
00:35:50,771 --> 00:35:54,483
"I'll evenly divide this house
into three parts for our children."

365
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,880
"It's the only way to stop
any of them from selling the house."

366
00:35:58,695 --> 00:36:00,055
Even when he was having an affair,

367
00:36:00,531 --> 00:36:03,075
he wasn't letting go
of the deed to the house.

368
00:36:04,952 --> 00:36:06,712
So there's no way
he'd have handed it to her.

369
00:36:09,206 --> 00:36:11,166
I'm going to ask your aunt first.

370
00:36:12,668 --> 00:36:13,710
And if it can't be helped…

371
00:36:16,088 --> 00:36:17,728
I'll meet her in person and ask directly.

372
00:36:17,756 --> 00:36:19,716
Meet who? That woman?

373
00:36:35,482 --> 00:36:37,651
Come on, pick it up.

374
00:37:11,768 --> 00:37:13,103
Hello.

375
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:16,523
I apologize for calling you
so early in the morning.

376
00:37:16,857 --> 00:37:18,066
They're a newlywed couple,

377
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:21,445
and both work full-time
so now was the only time they could spare.

378
00:37:21,528 --> 00:37:24,448
Why don't you guys go ahead
and take a look around?

379
00:37:24,531 --> 00:37:26,241
I'll park the car and follow you.

380
00:37:29,036 --> 00:37:30,078
This way, please.

381
00:37:31,872 --> 00:37:33,498
Aren't you Minyoung?

382
00:37:41,924 --> 00:37:46,011
I am his mother,
but he really is something else.

383
00:37:46,094 --> 00:37:50,891
"Tell me. Why did you two break up?"
I asked him countless times,

384
00:37:50,974 --> 00:37:52,643
and he just wouldn't budge.

385
00:37:52,893 --> 00:37:54,436
That's the kind of person he is.

386
00:37:54,519 --> 00:37:57,814
He doesn't have it in him
to spill other's dirty secrets.

387
00:37:59,858 --> 00:38:03,528
I already had a hunch
as to why you two broke up.

388
00:38:05,489 --> 00:38:08,825
If I couldn't understand you,
who could, you know?

389
00:38:09,868 --> 00:38:12,829
Make sure to answer my calls from now on

390
00:38:12,913 --> 00:38:14,706
and come meet me
at the address I send you.

391
00:38:14,915 --> 00:38:17,918
- Come and take a look at the house...
- We're not back together.

392
00:38:19,503 --> 00:38:21,296
What are you talking about?

393
00:38:21,797 --> 00:38:24,758
Don't even give me that pathetic lie.

394
00:38:24,841 --> 00:38:25,841
Gosh.

395
00:38:31,473 --> 00:38:34,518
<i>Twentieth floor. Door opening.</i>

396
00:38:35,519 --> 00:38:37,396
I'm sorry, but could you get off here?

397
00:38:40,065 --> 00:38:41,149
Me?

398
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:43,652
I'll show you the house next time.

399
00:38:43,735 --> 00:38:44,735
I'm sorry.

400
00:38:44,903 --> 00:38:46,780
- You mean us?
- Okay.

401
00:38:51,994 --> 00:38:53,495
<i>Door closing.</i>

402
00:39:08,427 --> 00:39:09,761
I live here.

403
00:39:10,846 --> 00:39:11,846
Across from him.

404
00:39:13,307 --> 00:39:14,725
And that changes things?

405
00:39:14,808 --> 00:39:16,685
Since you say you understand everything,

406
00:39:16,768 --> 00:39:19,313
I'll tell you how I dumped your son.

407
00:39:21,523 --> 00:39:24,860
While I was dating Dongjin,
I went on a blind date,

408
00:39:24,943 --> 00:39:26,403
met with that person's family,

409
00:39:26,486 --> 00:39:27,988
and even set a date for the wedding.

410
00:39:28,947 --> 00:39:32,617
Then I just told Dongjin
that I'm marrying someone else.

411
00:39:34,202 --> 00:39:35,537
That's not all.

412
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:38,420
My mom, who didn't approve of Dongjin
because he's got only one parent,

413
00:39:39,875 --> 00:39:41,543
even sent him a wedding invitation.

414
00:39:41,626 --> 00:39:43,628
That's just insane!

415
00:39:43,712 --> 00:39:45,297
I'm not done yet.

416
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:47,257
Perhaps I was getting punished,

417
00:39:47,424 --> 00:39:49,104
but it didn't work out
with that other guy.

418
00:39:49,134 --> 00:39:50,802
So I split up with him and came to Korea.

419
00:39:51,303 --> 00:39:53,543
And I moved into the apartment
right across from Dongjin.

420
00:39:54,056 --> 00:39:55,432
Because I wanted him back.

421
00:39:57,768 --> 00:39:59,768
I thought, "He'd forgive me
if I kept apologizing."

422
00:40:00,395 --> 00:40:02,981
"No matter how cold he tries to be,
I know Han Dongjin."

423
00:40:03,648 --> 00:40:05,901
That's how I was holding on
and I only just managed

424
00:40:05,984 --> 00:40:07,486
to let it go and give up.

425
00:40:09,071 --> 00:40:10,155
But you know what?

426
00:40:11,656 --> 00:40:12,657
I'm upset too.

427
00:40:14,076 --> 00:40:15,452
If it hadn't been for you…

428
00:40:15,952 --> 00:40:18,497
If you hadn't constantly asked me
to give you some money

429
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:21,333
or kept asking me to buy you stuff,

430
00:40:22,084 --> 00:40:24,044
I wouldn't have gone that far.

431
00:40:24,628 --> 00:40:26,129
So I can't give you any more money.

432
00:40:26,713 --> 00:40:29,383
You're the reason I became this way.

433
00:40:29,466 --> 00:40:30,801
Who are you trying to blame?

434
00:40:33,261 --> 00:40:37,474
Did you hear that?
Did you hear her ridiculous claims?

435
00:40:37,974 --> 00:40:39,810
My goodness…

436
00:40:41,978 --> 00:40:42,979
I'm sorry.

437
00:40:43,730 --> 00:40:44,730
Don't be.

438
00:40:44,773 --> 00:40:47,317
Let's talk later. Get inside.

439
00:40:47,401 --> 00:40:49,611
Hey, why are you crying?

440
00:40:49,903 --> 00:40:51,863
What on earth do you have to cry about?

441
00:40:52,239 --> 00:40:53,740
Please get inside.

442
00:40:53,824 --> 00:40:54,824
Talk to me.

443
00:41:05,085 --> 00:41:06,085
Sorry.

444
00:41:34,322 --> 00:41:37,576
Your poor mom lives alone.
Aren't you worried about why I called you?

445
00:41:37,659 --> 00:41:39,536
Pick up your phone on time.

446
00:41:39,744 --> 00:41:42,038
Don't make me run over here
so early in the morning.

447
00:41:43,039 --> 00:41:44,082
But you don't live alone.

448
00:41:44,666 --> 00:41:46,918
Well, I started living alone yesterday.

449
00:41:47,794 --> 00:41:49,045
That son of a…

450
00:41:49,713 --> 00:41:50,713
Gosh.

451
00:41:50,881 --> 00:41:55,594
Anyway, that jerk
took all my jewelry and ran off.

452
00:41:56,261 --> 00:42:00,098
I thought he was just playing cards
with friends for fun.

453
00:42:01,141 --> 00:42:02,601
I was scammed.

454
00:42:04,853 --> 00:42:06,646
Did you borrow money from Minyoung?

455
00:42:13,612 --> 00:42:14,612
How much?

456
00:42:15,197 --> 00:42:16,865
Well…

457
00:42:16,948 --> 00:42:19,576
It's really not much.

458
00:42:19,659 --> 00:42:22,162
How much? I have to know
in order to pay her back.

459
00:42:22,537 --> 00:42:24,873
What do you mean "pay her back"?

460
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,083
I heard what she did to you.

461
00:42:27,667 --> 00:42:30,128
I'm going after her
for compensation money.

462
00:42:33,423 --> 00:42:36,301
Come on, who do you think I am?

463
00:42:36,384 --> 00:42:40,180
I was just saying things.
I didn't mean them.

464
00:42:43,725 --> 00:42:44,809
Well…

465
00:42:47,062 --> 00:42:50,565
I'm going to live here for the time being.

466
00:42:52,025 --> 00:42:54,903
I don't want to go back to that house.

467
00:42:58,490 --> 00:43:03,286
I mean, if it's too awkward
to live with me, uh…

468
00:43:04,454 --> 00:43:05,956
you could give me some money.

469
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:07,999
And I'll go find a room to rent.

470
00:43:13,630 --> 00:43:14,630
I have to go to work.

471
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:20,303
You're coming straight home
afterward, right?

472
00:43:53,753 --> 00:43:56,423
<i>Not now. Let's talk later.</i>

473
00:43:57,007 --> 00:43:58,091
<i>Have a good day at work.</i>

474
00:44:07,642 --> 00:44:09,978
<i>I'm sorry. I'll apologize instead.</i>

475
00:44:44,179 --> 00:44:45,555
<i>I'm moving.</i>

476
00:44:46,973 --> 00:44:48,683
I won't be around here anymore.

477
00:44:52,103 --> 00:44:53,772
Why are you telling me this?

478
00:44:54,356 --> 00:44:56,316
Dongjin wants to be happy with you.

479
00:44:59,277 --> 00:45:01,321
How could I not give up
after hearing that?

480
00:45:04,532 --> 00:45:09,829
<i>I thought Dongjin would take
my broken self back into his arms.</i>

481
00:45:11,831 --> 00:45:13,208
<i>Maybe he couldn't love me,</i>

482
00:45:14,626 --> 00:45:18,129
<i>but I thought he'd at least be
by my side until I became okay.</i>

483
00:45:24,010 --> 00:45:27,222
<i>If it hadn't been for you,
maybe it could have happened.</i>

484
00:46:18,815 --> 00:46:20,650
I heard from Sunwoo.

485
00:46:22,318 --> 00:46:23,318
That…

486
00:46:24,904 --> 00:46:26,264
you're going to quit working here.

487
00:46:30,702 --> 00:46:31,995
I thought I told you.

488
00:46:33,163 --> 00:46:34,789
I don't want to extend my contract.

489
00:46:38,251 --> 00:46:39,794
Can't you reconsider?

490
00:46:49,095 --> 00:46:53,308
I think I'll be sad
if you're not around when I'm at work.

491
00:47:01,065 --> 00:47:01,983
Good morning.

492
00:47:02,066 --> 00:47:03,318
- Hello.
- Yes, good morning.

493
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:06,070
I'll be at my desk.

494
00:47:09,199 --> 00:47:10,116
I'll talk to you later.

495
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:11,951
Get me that thing from yesterday.

496
00:47:12,035 --> 00:47:13,035
Okay.

497
00:47:14,704 --> 00:47:15,997
Good morning.

498
00:47:23,963 --> 00:47:25,006
Hello, sir.

499
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:28,300
Good morning.

500
00:47:29,928 --> 00:47:31,221
Did you have breakfast?

501
00:47:45,318 --> 00:47:46,318
Hmm?

502
00:47:48,613 --> 00:47:51,908
Be polite and don't tell her
about your singing.

503
00:47:52,742 --> 00:47:54,869
Why? Are you embarrassed about that?

504
00:47:55,453 --> 00:47:57,121
Watch your tone with me. I'm your mother.

505
00:47:57,872 --> 00:47:59,999
There will be people
jealous of you when you do well

506
00:48:00,083 --> 00:48:02,418
and delighted when you fail.

507
00:48:02,502 --> 00:48:03,586
Don't even care about them.

508
00:48:04,504 --> 00:48:05,824
Then why are you taking me there?

509
00:48:06,589 --> 00:48:09,008
Your aunt only has two daughters.

510
00:48:09,592 --> 00:48:10,592
Oh.

511
00:48:10,969 --> 00:48:12,512
My mom sure knows how to strategize.

512
00:48:28,570 --> 00:48:29,779
Have some coffee.

513
00:48:31,114 --> 00:48:32,156
It's been a while, Jigu.

514
00:48:32,782 --> 00:48:33,658
Yes, it has.

515
00:48:33,783 --> 00:48:35,952
What are you up to these days?
Did you get a job?

516
00:48:36,035 --> 00:48:37,954
Thank you for the coffee.

517
00:48:38,037 --> 00:48:39,831
Sure.

518
00:48:42,417 --> 00:48:45,003
Hyunju, are you feeling better nowadays?

519
00:48:45,712 --> 00:48:47,152
I'm sorry I didn't reach out to you.

520
00:48:47,755 --> 00:48:49,799
I've been so busy.

521
00:48:49,883 --> 00:48:52,719
You meet with Heeja often, right?

522
00:48:53,553 --> 00:48:54,721
I don't meet her often.

523
00:48:55,972 --> 00:48:59,809
Just once or twice during the holidays?
I don't really meet her apart from that.

524
00:49:00,310 --> 00:49:02,230
I thought to myself
that I wouldn't talk about it

525
00:49:02,312 --> 00:49:05,023
since it's been over ten years
and it would make me feel old.

526
00:49:05,106 --> 00:49:06,858
But seeing you right now, I can't help it.

527
00:49:08,401 --> 00:49:10,737
Who prepared birthday meals
for your husband

528
00:49:11,362 --> 00:49:13,656
and took care of your daughters
after they gave birth?

529
00:49:13,740 --> 00:49:16,743
Come on. Why are you
digging up such old history?

530
00:49:16,826 --> 00:49:18,637
I didn't tell you
to cut off ties with your brother.

531
00:49:18,661 --> 00:49:20,371
We were close.

532
00:49:20,455 --> 00:49:22,165
When you heard that I was sick,

533
00:49:22,248 --> 00:49:25,043
didn't you wonder how sick I was
or how I was doing?

534
00:49:27,003 --> 00:49:29,339
I have no excuse for that.

535
00:49:30,131 --> 00:49:35,178
Then tell me everything you know
about the house in Yeonhui-dong, Heeja,

536
00:49:35,261 --> 00:49:36,596
and the man she lives with.

537
00:49:36,679 --> 00:49:38,097
Don't leave anything out.

538
00:49:38,890 --> 00:49:40,892
I want to tell you everything too,

539
00:49:41,559 --> 00:49:44,103
but Woojoo knows more than I do.

540
00:49:44,354 --> 00:49:46,940
She should have met with Heeja's son.

541
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:50,360
You must not have heard.

542
00:49:50,944 --> 00:49:53,571
Then you probably don't know
she's been to the police station.

543
00:49:54,197 --> 00:49:55,823
- The police station?
- Yeah.

544
00:50:11,506 --> 00:50:13,633
<i>Woojoo, why didn't you say?</i>

545
00:50:13,925 --> 00:50:14,925
<i>Say what?</i>

546
00:50:20,515 --> 00:50:22,308
<i>That you've been
to the police station,</i>

547
00:50:22,392 --> 00:50:23,872
<i>and that you've met that woman's son.</i>

548
00:50:35,196 --> 00:50:37,532
<i>The person
you're trying to reach is not available…</i>

549
00:50:50,712 --> 00:50:52,380
NUTJOB NUMBER TWO

550
00:50:57,969 --> 00:51:00,722
<i>She found out
that Heeja was still living in that house,</i>

551
00:51:00,805 --> 00:51:03,224
and went over there to confront her.

552
00:51:03,808 --> 00:51:06,477
She wouldn't open the door
and instead just called the cops on her.

553
00:51:06,561 --> 00:51:08,354
So I had to go bail her out.

554
00:51:14,318 --> 00:51:15,318
Mom.

555
00:51:16,404 --> 00:51:17,447
Let's just go quietly.

556
00:51:23,828 --> 00:51:26,289
<i>We're on our way to Yeonhui-dong.
I'll call you later.</i>

557
00:52:38,694 --> 00:52:39,694
Mom, should we just go?

558
00:52:40,404 --> 00:52:41,404
Why?

559
00:52:41,906 --> 00:52:43,616
You don't think I can take her?

560
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:46,828
Not at all. I'm afraid you'll mess her up.

561
00:52:49,497 --> 00:52:51,749
Let's just listen to
what Woojoo has to say.

562
00:52:53,543 --> 00:52:54,543
Okay?

563
00:52:56,587 --> 00:52:58,005
Look, it's Woojoo.

564
00:53:25,074 --> 00:53:26,325
Can we even be here?

565
00:53:26,409 --> 00:53:28,619
Yes, I got permission from the boss.

566
00:53:28,995 --> 00:53:31,235
On days we close,
I use this place as my practice studio.

567
00:53:31,706 --> 00:53:32,826
We'll just need to clean up.

568
00:53:39,463 --> 00:53:40,631
Now tell me.

569
00:53:42,884 --> 00:53:44,760
I heard you've been to the police station.

570
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:47,221
And I heard you met Heeja's son.

571
00:53:49,223 --> 00:53:50,474
What did he say?

572
00:53:51,642 --> 00:53:52,977
What do you think?

573
00:53:53,060 --> 00:53:55,229
I bet he said,
"I'm sorry but it's our house now."

574
00:53:55,855 --> 00:53:56,855
He didn't.

575
00:53:59,859 --> 00:54:04,322
At first, I heard that she sold the house
to invest in her son's company.

576
00:54:05,489 --> 00:54:06,782
But it turned out

577
00:54:07,992 --> 00:54:09,952
the son had nothing to do with it.

578
00:54:14,373 --> 00:54:19,045
But he was still looking for us.
To apologize to us.

579
00:54:19,670 --> 00:54:20,755
Apologize to us?

580
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:24,091
Yes.

581
00:54:26,010 --> 00:54:27,762
He looked so guilty.

582
00:54:29,347 --> 00:54:31,515
I couldn't even suspect
any other intention

583
00:54:32,934 --> 00:54:33,934
as he apologized.

584
00:54:47,782 --> 00:54:48,783
I'm sorry.

585
00:54:58,334 --> 00:54:59,418
<i>So…</i>

586
00:55:00,378 --> 00:55:01,796
<i>I told him I understood.</i>

587
00:55:03,673 --> 00:55:04,966
<i>And I told him it was okay.</i>

588
00:55:06,676 --> 00:55:08,636
<i>I also told him that it wasn't his fault.</i>

589
00:55:10,596 --> 00:55:13,182
Just like how we suffered because of Dad,

590
00:55:14,684 --> 00:55:15,893
he seemed like

591
00:55:17,311 --> 00:55:20,273
he suffered a lot because of his mom.

592
00:55:23,484 --> 00:55:25,152
So I forgave him.

593
00:55:28,447 --> 00:55:30,241
I'm sorry I didn't tell you earlier.

594
00:55:36,664 --> 00:55:37,873
Is that all?

595
00:55:41,460 --> 00:55:42,940
Is there anything else you're hiding?

596
00:55:47,883 --> 00:55:48,883
There isn't.

597
00:56:00,646 --> 00:56:02,565
- Are you clocking out?
- I am.

598
00:56:06,527 --> 00:56:09,113
Sir, we're clocking out for the day!

599
00:56:50,571 --> 00:56:53,115
WHERE ARE YOU?
DID SOMETHING HAPPEN?

600
00:57:01,248 --> 00:57:03,834
SIM JIGU

601
00:57:19,433 --> 00:57:20,851
- You're here.
- Yes.

602
00:57:21,352 --> 00:57:22,561
You heard from Jigu, right?

603
00:57:22,645 --> 00:57:25,231
He said we should grab beers.
Let's get some on our way back.

604
00:57:26,941 --> 00:57:29,110
Mom's leaving tomorrow.

605
00:57:29,568 --> 00:57:30,569
So come back home.

606
00:57:31,487 --> 00:57:33,656
It's not because of her
that I hadn't been home.

607
00:57:34,198 --> 00:57:35,491
I'm coming back home tonight.

608
00:58:03,978 --> 00:58:05,521
- Hi.
<i>- Where are you?</i>

609
00:58:06,230 --> 00:58:07,230
<i>Right now, I'm…</i>

610
00:58:07,648 --> 00:58:09,288
I had some things to take care of at home

611
00:58:09,859 --> 00:58:12,069
and I didn't think to call you.

612
00:58:13,446 --> 00:58:15,114
I'll explain tomorrow morning.

613
00:58:15,197 --> 00:58:16,557
You look like you had a rough day.

614
00:58:33,883 --> 00:58:35,176
Mr. Han?

615
00:58:39,221 --> 00:58:41,140
I told you.

616
00:58:41,223 --> 00:58:42,725
It's good we bought a lot of beer.

617
00:58:44,143 --> 00:58:45,853
Let's go in together.

618
00:59:03,537 --> 00:59:06,499
<i>Gosh, so a moment like this
can actually happen in real life.</i>

619
00:59:06,582 --> 00:59:09,710
This is truly such a happy moment.

620
00:59:13,797 --> 00:59:14,797
Good to see you.

621
00:59:15,382 --> 00:59:16,382
Yes, ma'am.

622
00:59:19,053 --> 00:59:20,638
Start singing, Jigu.

623
00:59:21,222 --> 00:59:22,222
Okay.

624
00:59:22,431 --> 00:59:23,641
Let me first announce

625
00:59:24,141 --> 00:59:27,895
that we're gathered here today
by the official request of Ms. Kim Hyunju,

626
00:59:27,978 --> 00:59:30,439
who is gracing us with her presence here.

627
00:59:30,523 --> 00:59:31,732
You did this?

628
00:59:32,483 --> 00:59:34,109
You said no one's heard him sing.

629
00:59:34,193 --> 00:59:35,528
We should at least hear him once.

630
00:59:37,821 --> 00:59:39,615
I don't know
why my voice is shaking so much.

631
00:59:39,698 --> 00:59:41,200
First of all,

632
00:59:41,867 --> 00:59:44,286
it's a great honor
to be able to sing in front of you all.

633
00:59:44,578 --> 00:59:46,664
You who trust me the least in the world,

634
00:59:47,206 --> 00:59:50,960
but also cherish me the most in the world.

635
00:59:58,676 --> 00:59:59,927
