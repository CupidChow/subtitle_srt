00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:25,066
There was a poet,
who once said the following.

2
00:00:26,067 --> 00:00:29,779
That if you wanna understand,
if you wanna forgive,

3
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:32,532
and if you wanna love someone...

4
00:00:32,615 --> 00:00:35,785
...you should observe how they look
from the back

5
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:36,786
for a long while.

6
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,163
-Mr. Han.
-Mr. Han.

7
00:00:38,246 --> 00:00:40,290
That if you do just that,

8
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:45,211
you don't have to unnecessarily
try to understand, forgive, or love them

9
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:47,964
because their lonely shadow

10
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:50,592
will have made you cry
without you even knowing.

11
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:53,303
-They're right.
-Hey, how's it going?

12
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:55,346
To understand someone's loneliness...

13
00:00:56,598 --> 00:00:59,934
Well, for me, I think
that's the beginning of love.

14
00:01:00,643 --> 00:01:03,396
Here is Wonstein singing, "Secret Garden."

15
00:01:10,945 --> 00:01:17,035
2021 SEOUL LIGHTING EXHIBITION

16
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,655
You're such an idiot.

17
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:56,116
You should have known
it was gonna crumble,

18
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:57,534
pay more attention.

19
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:59,119
You're picking up the check today.

20
00:01:59,702 --> 00:02:01,579
More like you're
getting free dinner again.

21
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:02,956
Come on, let's play.

22
00:02:04,999 --> 00:02:06,918
Ugh, why is my heart pounding so hard?

23
00:02:07,877 --> 00:02:09,754
The back of my neck's
been prickly all day.

24
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:12,465
I wonder what awful thing will happen.

25
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:16,219
You could cut out coffee,
drink less alcohol.

26
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:18,805
-And don't think about cigarettes.
-Why?

27
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:21,057
Because I don't want
to lose my drinking buddy.

28
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:23,560
Let's ruin our health a bit less then.

29
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:25,520
Don't go telling everyone
you're a pharmacist,

30
00:02:25,603 --> 00:02:27,188
they might just stone you.

31
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:33,319
NEIGHBORHOOD HEAD LADY: WE REGRET TO
INFORM YOU OF MR. SIM CHULMIN'S DEATH...

32
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:00,305
-A bottle of soju, please.
-All right!

33
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:12,442
Do you wanna make a bet?

34
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:15,236
Winner gets a wish from the loser.

35
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,906
Hey, stop trying to play me
and just pay okay?

36
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:22,660
Ugh.

37
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,247
I think I should put in
the seasoned soy sauce

38
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:27,749
or the spicy sauce?

39
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:28,833
Sweet choices, yeah?

40
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:34,047
What's the bet on?

41
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:35,798
-Are you in?
-Tell me first.

42
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:40,386
Whether it might rain or not.

43
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:42,764
Well, I'd bet it would.

44
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:46,768
Aha! So you're trying
to scam me, not make a bet, huh?

45
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:48,436
You haven't checked the weather?

46
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:50,188
No, I didn't check the weather.

47
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:52,607
If you can't trust a lifelong friend,

48
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:54,525
you can check it on your stupid app.

49
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:55,443
Mm.

50
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:58,279
All right, I'll check the app.

51
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,993
Hey, the chance of rain
is about ten percent.

52
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,203
You certain you wanna do it?

53
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:06,287
Do you?

54
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:08,331
Sure.

55
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:14,128
Why are you making this bet?

56
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:20,093
If I win the bet knowing
that that's the probability...

57
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:23,554
Well, it'd mean the sky's gone nuts.

58
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:28,810
So I thought my own insanity
wouldn't be all that noticeable.

59
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:31,396
I could cause some real trouble.

60
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:35,483
What lunacy are you preparing
to unleash now?

61
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:36,693
You're scaring me.

62
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:54,669
Congee and two bottles of soju,
fifteen thousand won, please.

63
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:55,586
Soju?

64
00:04:57,005 --> 00:05:00,466
Hey, lady, you said two bottles of soju
went to his table!

65
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:04,387
Hey, are you deaf?
Can't you hear me, or what?

66
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,723
Hey, I think the soju was for us.

67
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:11,602
That's right, there aren't any bottles
on his table.

68
00:05:13,187 --> 00:05:14,480
Oh! Seriously,

69
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:16,274
-I really should fire that girl.
-Let's get out of here.

70
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:20,153
You know, mister, you should have
told me you didn't order it.

71
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:21,988
I was yelling
and now my throat hurts.

72
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:24,949
Listen, ma'am.

73
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:27,952
The way he asked, "Soju?"
That means he didn't order it.

74
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:30,538
Why are you giving him such a hard time?

75
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:32,123
Uh, well then.

76
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:33,207
We're ready to pay.

77
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:34,625
I'm sorry.

78
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:36,753
I'm not the one you owe an apology.

79
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:38,504
Who knows if he'll come back?

80
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:02,904
ONE WAY

81
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:10,513
CALL IT LOVE

82
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:12,765
EPISODE 1

83
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:14,142
The rice is ready.

84
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:16,811
Sim Haesung, Sim Jigu,
breakfast is ready!

85
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:29,323
I set the table, so wake up Jigu and eat.

86
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:30,950
When you're done, soak the dishes.

87
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:33,453
It's hard to wash them
if there's food stuck on them.

88
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:47,008
Oh, what's that? A big roach?

89
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:48,968
Where?

90
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:49,886
Where?

91
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:50,928
You're awake then.

92
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,140
Gosh.

93
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,101
The alarm hasn't rung.

94
00:07:58,769 --> 00:08:00,396
I can sleep a little longer.

95
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:02,732
Oh, yeah.

96
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,983
Oh, what now? What do you want?

97
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:06,277
Ten percent chance of rain today
just so you know.

98
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,988
I watch the news in the morning too!

99
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,158
Stop waking me up before my alarm!

100
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:14,702
Why don't you use that energy to wake up?

101
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:36,390
PUBLIC OFFICIAL EXAM VOCABULARY

102
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:08,714
Come eat breakfast.

103
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:13,970
Oh, okay, okay.

104
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:16,055
Okay, you attacked me first, don't forget.

105
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,392
-Mmm.
-Look over here.

106
00:09:19,475 --> 00:09:21,310
Oh, it's bad.

107
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:23,104
Whoa, that's really bad.

108
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:24,355
Oh, it's so bad.

109
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:25,731
Yeah, that's a good one.

110
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:28,818
-Why'd you do that?
-Huh?

111
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:31,112
I'm gonna send these great pics
to your boyfriend.

112
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:33,531
Wow, if he still wants to marry you,
that's true love right there.

113
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:36,158
-He may not recognize you.
-Delete them while you have the chance.

114
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:37,702
I don't wanna have
to get violent with you, so...

115
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:38,828
Excuse me?

116
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:40,997
-You think I'll lose to an old hag?
-Who you calling old hag?

117
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,164
You should try again.

118
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:45,126
Old hag, old age,
old people, old spinster!

119
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:47,545
They all mean old and frail, you idiot.

120
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:57,763
Why'd you do that to me?

121
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:00,600
-Give it!
-Huh?

122
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:04,020
Look who's old now, you punk.

123
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:06,897
Ow, my back.

124
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:08,024
It was already bad.

125
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:10,234
-Wow. Come, eat breakfast.
-You're really crazy.

126
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:14,780
-Give me my phone back.
-No.

127
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:17,283
Oh, you're out of your mind.
Why'd you kick me in the back?

128
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:18,743
I have an injury.

129
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,077
Give it back.

130
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:22,705
-I have to delete the pictures first.
-Come on, just give it back.

131
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:24,165
How do I do this?

132
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:25,875
You better not send those.

133
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:28,586
-Okay, just give it back.
-Oh, stop. I have to delete them.

134
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:00,159
Sir.

135
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:02,411
There's a problem
with the Singapore exhibition.

136
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:29,772
Oh, what a sudden downpour.

137
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:35,611
JUN PHARMACY

138
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:46,455
There's one thing in this world
that never fails you.

139
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,543
A foreboding.

140
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,842
You know how animals seem to know
when an earthquake is coming

141
00:11:57,925 --> 00:11:59,385
and seek shelter?

142
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:02,930
They have the ability
to predict their fate.

143
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:06,016
But humans can't, can they?

144
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:01,363
It means we lost our bid again.

145
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:04,283
I mean,
didn't they say it was for sure this time?

146
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:05,701
-Yeah.
-...to go under real soon.

147
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,244
Yeah, I know.

148
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:08,704
It's risky, right?

149
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:12,416
Wasn't the result due
the day after tomorrow?

150
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,752
Officially, yes. But, uh...

151
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:17,713
I know their team leader personally.

152
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:21,592
He said we've the most experience
with exhibitions in Singapore,

153
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:23,719
and assured me that it was a sure deal.

154
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:25,805
But then, uh...

155
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:28,224
Is it President Shin who won the bid?

156
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:30,643
Yeah.

157
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:33,354
It seems he only bids on the contracts
that we're trying to get.

158
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,525
I think...
he's obviously blocking us.

159
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:41,028
Should I try and get
the contract fee back?

160
00:13:42,112 --> 00:13:44,907
No way we'll get that back.
And President Shin knows it too.

161
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:52,164
MOTHER

162
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:58,504
Can you please sum up all the payments

163
00:13:58,587 --> 00:14:00,673
that are due this, um, week,
and send them to me?

164
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:01,799
I'll review it on the go.

165
00:14:01,882 --> 00:14:03,175
Yes.

166
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:12,017
Miss Baek, wait.

167
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,896
Shin's interference. Have you told Sunwoo?

168
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:18,649
Yeah, I already did.

169
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:36,709
SHINWOO FAIR

170
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:37,793
Yes.

171
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:40,421
Oh, I should be the one thanking you.

172
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:41,797
Yes, yes.

173
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,424
Yes, we'll do our best.

174
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:46,760
So you're here.

175
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:49,597
Yes, sir. Wait.

176
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:51,932
Uh-huh, that's right.

177
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:55,102
Oh, you've got some guts now, Team Leader.

178
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:56,729
Lower your tone to your mentor, would you?

179
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:59,023
You're not my mentor now
and I'm president.

180
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:01,442
It was five years ago
we started our company.

181
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:02,735
Uh-huh.

182
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:08,073
So how about the Singapore fair?

183
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:09,783
Did you undersell us on it?

184
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:14,079
Hey, would you have been able
to outbid me?

185
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:15,915
Mm?

186
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:20,794
Even if I told you whether
I underbid on it or not?

187
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:23,505
You guys don't have the money, right?

188
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:27,384
If you and Dongjin
were still working under me,

189
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:28,677
how nice would that be?

190
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,346
You two used to be my little errand boys,

191
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:32,097
so, of course, I'm pissed off.

192
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:40,773
You see...

193
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:44,360
I don't particularly want
to encourage your pettiness

194
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:45,653
so I would just ask.

195
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,529
You're doing all this,

196
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:50,824
is this some kinda sad attempt at revenge?

197
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:54,828
How many times do I have to tell you
that we didn't take your employees--

198
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:55,913
Who saying that?

199
00:15:57,414 --> 00:15:59,083
You think this is a sad attempt.

200
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:01,835
Revenge is also a means to make a living.

201
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:04,421
And my constipation was done
after I screwed you, guys.

202
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:06,674
You really are peculiar, you know that?

203
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:09,760
-You must be tired.
-Why would I be tired?

204
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:11,595
I'm livid right now.

205
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:13,222
You guys are just ripe for the picking,

206
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:14,807
so why wouldn't I kick you
while you're down?

207
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:16,809
All right...

208
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:19,311
Are you about done?

209
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:22,773
Hmm...

210
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:25,442
You still have your company.

211
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:28,946
So, I guess I'm not finished.

212
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:09,695
-Mm.
-"Mm?"

213
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:11,488
How can you say that right now to me?

214
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:13,073
The lunch hour is the most busy one.

215
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:15,492
Wherever you are, just get back here.

216
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:16,869
But it's raining.

217
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:18,037
Well, so what?

218
00:17:19,663 --> 00:17:21,123
I thought I told you.

219
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:27,588
That if I beat the 90 percent chance
and it actually rained...

220
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:32,801
...I would cause some real trouble.

221
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:43,812
JEIL FUNERAL PARLOR

222
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:07,503
PREMIUM SUITE 1
THE LATE SIM CHULMIN

223
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:36,406
Someone once told me that.

224
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:40,077
If you really need
to take revenge on someone,

225
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,955
even after a decade or two,
well, you should try.

226
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:45,541
Simply pulling a chair out
from under them.

227
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:50,921
Young lady. What, um...

228
00:18:51,004 --> 00:18:52,172
What do you think you're doing here?

229
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:54,091
The point I'm trying to make...

230
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:58,137
is "If an opportunity arises,
humiliate them by any means you can."

231
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,471
Wouldn't you agree?

232
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,350
I don't know who you are.

233
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:05,519
It's been 15 years.

234
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:07,646
So I suppose there's a chance you don't.

235
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:18,615
Sim Chulmin's daughter, Sim Woojoo.

236
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:20,409
Remember?

237
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:24,163
Oh.

238
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,456
I've grown a lot, right?

239
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,417
And you, well...

240
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:31,003
Oh...

241
00:19:32,045 --> 00:19:33,422
You've grown old, huh?

242
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:50,480
Heeja.

243
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:51,982
Chulmin.

244
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:54,276
Let's get going.

245
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,529
I'm sorry. It's 'cause of me...

246
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:01,783
Don't say that, Heeja.

247
00:20:50,707 --> 00:20:53,460
34, 62-1 YEONHUI-DONG

248
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:18,610
Gimme some more stew
and another bottle of soju!

249
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:32,624
It's all right,
don't pay any attention to me

250
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:34,084
and enjoy your meals.

251
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:36,378
Aunt number 1, Uncle,

252
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:38,130
Aunt number 2.

253
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,215
Have you been well?

254
00:21:41,174 --> 00:21:43,343
Well, other than the fact that

255
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:46,555
I found out about the funeral
via messages in the neighborhood chat,

256
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:48,640
I guess I've been all right then.

257
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:50,642
We heard you cut ties
with your father a long time ago.

258
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:51,977
That's why we didn't reach out.

259
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:54,187
It's not like we didn't want to tell you.

260
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:57,691
Mm. So considerate.

261
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:01,862
Oh, then what about the ten million won
that you borrowed from my mom?

262
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:04,281
You acted like that never happened
when they divorced.

263
00:22:04,364 --> 00:22:06,450
I wonder if that's also you
being considerate.

264
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:09,161
Will you give me an answer today?

265
00:22:09,244 --> 00:22:11,788
You could always give me
the money instead.

266
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:16,084
Oh. Oh, I should just stop talking to you.

267
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:19,254
How can a child be so disrespectful
to her elders?

268
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:20,422
Guess what?

269
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:24,593
I could be really nasty right now,

270
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:26,303
but I'm showing you respect.

271
00:22:28,221 --> 00:22:29,973
Because that's what adults do.

272
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:41,902
Why...

273
00:22:41,985 --> 00:22:43,695
The person you are
trying to reach can't answer the phone...

274
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:46,239
Oh, why aren't you answering the phone?

275
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:48,200
Always when I need you.

276
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:52,579
The line you are calling is busy...

277
00:22:52,662 --> 00:22:54,664
MG SAEMAEUL FINANCE FIRM

278
00:22:57,292 --> 00:22:59,419
Yes, I can make
the payments next month.

279
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:04,716
Right. I apologize.

280
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:06,760
Yes.

281
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:26,321
Excuse me, sir. I apologize.

282
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:29,699
Our department chief says he forgot
that he had a prior engagement...

283
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:31,785
I know you were waiting a while.

284
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:33,662
I apologize on his behalf.

285
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:35,414
Could I just see him briefly?

286
00:23:36,706 --> 00:23:38,959
Uh... So he says that he'll call you.

287
00:23:39,042 --> 00:23:40,877
He can't see you today.

288
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,629
I apologize.

289
00:23:48,301 --> 00:23:49,594
He'd at least need my number then.

290
00:23:50,303 --> 00:23:51,721
Ah, yes, indeed.

291
00:23:52,347 --> 00:23:53,557
If you could pass it along...

292
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,724
Yes.

293
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:57,936
Have a nice day. Goodbye, sir.

294
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:04,317
Best Fairs?

295
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:05,527
HAN DONGJIN: CEO, BEST FAIRS

296
00:24:06,736 --> 00:24:10,866
Not only is he ruggedly good-looking,
he's a CEO as well?

297
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:13,160
So you think he's good-looking?

298
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:16,121
Hmm. To me, he just seemed like someone
who came here to get a loan.

299
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:17,581
Listen.

300
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:20,792
I'm sure you've heard the rumor
that you're a bad judge of men.

301
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:22,669
They say you're the worst in the branch.

302
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:24,546
Who's spewing that kind of nonsense?

303
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:25,797
Me.

304
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:28,508
It's me.

305
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:31,052
When I get married next spring,

306
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:33,388
you're gonna catch my bouquet
when I toss it, right?

307
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:34,639
Mm-hmm.

308
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,241
You've grown up well.

309
00:24:54,951 --> 00:24:56,578
You're the second child, right?

310
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:02,209
I'm asking you
for the sake of your dead father.

311
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:05,378
Please can you just remove yourself?

312
00:25:06,296 --> 00:25:08,715
We'll contact you with the burial info.

313
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:11,384
What's up with the cheap side dishes?

314
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:13,929
I thought this was a premium suite.

315
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:15,805
There could be 12

316
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:17,140
-or nine?
-Hmm?

317
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:18,808
Eight sides!

318
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:21,144
If not, what about just six, huh?

319
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:22,395
Or are you too cheap for that?

320
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:24,773
What? What are you saying, hmm?

321
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:30,070
What's wrong?

322
00:25:31,404 --> 00:25:33,406
You don't like that word?

323
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:35,200
If you ask me "cheap" suits you.

324
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:37,661
I guess, everyone here knows that.

325
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:39,704
Not just cheap but you're...

326
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:42,874
an overachieving cheap side piece
who stole her friend's husband.

327
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:44,501
-Hey!
-What?

328
00:25:45,168 --> 00:25:46,962
Who are you to raise your voice?

329
00:25:48,838 --> 00:25:50,215
Thirteen years ago,

330
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:53,134
when the two of you took off
with the bank account book

331
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:54,094
and the jewelry,

332
00:25:54,177 --> 00:25:55,595
you didn't prepare for this, huh?

333
00:25:57,681 --> 00:25:59,015
Keep your voice down.

334
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:01,685
What, is this humiliating you?

335
00:26:01,768 --> 00:26:03,770
Your entire life is so embarrassing.

336
00:26:03,853 --> 00:26:05,730
You... you brat!

337
00:26:18,618 --> 00:26:20,370
You just going to stand there?

338
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:23,456
Hmm, well, I won't leave
until I finish the soju.

339
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:28,003
You didn't really believe
that I'd come here just to humiliate you?

340
00:26:33,508 --> 00:26:36,636
I'm here for the ghost of the man
whose funeral we're attending.

341
00:26:40,056 --> 00:26:42,392
To show him that his daughter
has been waiting for this day

342
00:26:42,475 --> 00:26:43,727
for all these years.

343
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:50,442
Okay, fine.

344
00:26:50,525 --> 00:26:51,818
You eat up.

345
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:55,155
Finish eating and then go.

346
00:27:56,549 --> 00:27:57,634
Keep it in.

347
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:02,222
If you cry right now, you're a loser.

348
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:11,398
You mean that woman
sold the house in Yeonhui-dong?

349
00:28:11,481 --> 00:28:13,316
Your brother put the deed in her name

350
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,734
just before he died.

351
00:28:14,818 --> 00:28:16,903
And then, that ridiculous woman went
and sold it

352
00:28:16,986 --> 00:28:19,239
as soon as her name was on it.

353
00:28:19,322 --> 00:28:20,907
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.

354
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:22,450
So then Woojoo came here

355
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:24,828
to confront her
about her house being sold.

356
00:28:24,911 --> 00:28:27,455
I was afraid for the worst,
but it was better than I thought.

357
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:29,874
I was so worried
that she was gonna flip out and...

358
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:31,710
Oh, I don't know,
throw a table or something.

359
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:32,669
-Jeez.
-I mean...

360
00:28:32,752 --> 00:28:35,672
That little thing is so fiercely feisty,
you know what I mean?

361
00:28:35,755 --> 00:28:37,132
Goodness.

362
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:38,133
Oh!

363
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:40,510
Repeat it to me, who sold what?

364
00:28:40,593 --> 00:28:43,680
Oh. Oh, dear. I really have
to use the restroom.

365
00:28:46,349 --> 00:28:48,893
Well, I, uh, so I thought
maybe you'd already left.

366
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:50,687
-Auntie!
-What, what, huh?

367
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:52,480
Tell me what was sold right now!

368
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:54,941
Don't look at me like that!

369
00:28:55,024 --> 00:28:56,651
Maybe you should ask Heeja instead of me!

370
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:08,121
-Let go of me.
-Just come with me.

371
00:29:08,204 --> 00:29:10,665
-Let go and answer me!
-Settle down, let's talk up here.

372
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:11,791
Here...

373
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:13,001
-Be quiet.
-Just tell me.

374
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:14,878
Tell me, did you sell our house or not?

375
00:29:14,961 --> 00:29:17,172
I said be quiet and follow me.

376
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:19,466
Oh, come on! You brat!

377
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:20,717
I said let go!

378
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:24,804
Why are you doing this to me?

379
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:27,348
Didn't you crash the funeral
'cause you knew that?

380
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:31,728
Why the look?

381
00:29:31,811 --> 00:29:34,272
What? Nobody bothered
to mention it to you?

382
00:29:34,355 --> 00:29:36,065
So, you really came here

383
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:37,984
just to try to punish my dead husband,

384
00:29:38,067 --> 00:29:39,569
looking like a hooker?

385
00:29:41,988 --> 00:29:43,323
Who's really cheap?

386
00:29:43,406 --> 00:29:45,658
Because look who's talking.

387
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:47,368
Explain it then.

388
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:49,162
Tell me, why would it belong to you?

389
00:29:49,245 --> 00:29:50,789
Because it doesn't, okay?

390
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:52,123
Hang on a sec.

391
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:54,083
You should do something about your phone.

392
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:56,503
It's driving me crazy.

393
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:01,257
-Look, I'll call you later--
-Woojoo!

394
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:03,718
Why don't you answer your phone?

395
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:05,845
Some people are here
telling me to vacate the house...

396
00:30:08,598 --> 00:30:10,350
We'll need to change it all out.

397
00:30:10,433 --> 00:30:11,810
Right? New wallpaper?

398
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:15,647
Please, Woojoo, where are you?

399
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:16,773
The house is mine!

400
00:30:16,856 --> 00:30:18,316
Keep your voice down!

401
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:20,944
What makes you think it's okay
to shout at me like that?

402
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:25,114
Look, your father and I
were legally married you get it?

403
00:30:25,698 --> 00:30:28,034
That house was under your father's name.

404
00:30:28,117 --> 00:30:30,203
It belonged to you then,
but now it's an inheritance.

405
00:30:30,286 --> 00:30:31,538
It was mine to sell.

406
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:34,040
-I haven't done anything wrong, okay?
-Well, you can't just force us out.

407
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:36,709
You can't just take away our home,
we live there still.

408
00:30:37,752 --> 00:30:38,753
I swear...

409
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:41,297
If you take our home away from us,
karma will come for you.

410
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:43,091
You can't uproot us like that,
how could you?

411
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:46,302
You really think karma exists?

412
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:48,805
I'll consider the humiliation
I endured today

413
00:30:48,888 --> 00:30:50,223
as punishment enough.

414
00:30:50,306 --> 00:30:51,558
About the house?

415
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:53,351
You have a week to move out.

416
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:57,730
Take this.

417
00:30:58,439 --> 00:30:59,732
Use it to catch a cab.

418
00:31:00,733 --> 00:31:02,944
You can't go on the bus looking like that.

419
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:06,739
Where are you going?
We're not finished yet.

420
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:07,907
What the hell?

421
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:10,285
Don't you touch me!

422
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:11,911
I'm done being nice,

423
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:14,497
you need to respect me
and your dead father.

424
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:17,876
Stop this now unless you want you
and your precious siblings...

425
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:20,336
...pulled out by force.

426
00:31:35,518 --> 00:31:36,978
Oh!

427
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:39,772
Whoo!

428
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:45,528
Shoot.

429
00:31:51,534 --> 00:31:53,244
Mmm.

430
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:54,287
Hmm?

431
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:57,832
DONGJIN:
123 HAMCHON-RO, DONGJAK-GU, SEOUL

432
00:31:57,916 --> 00:31:59,000
Ah, eeesh!

433
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:04,672
Hey...

434
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:19,729
Hey, where did you get the car key?

435
00:32:19,812 --> 00:32:21,689
Where do you think I got it?

436
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:27,487
I guess you went through my desk.

437
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:28,821
Anyway.

438
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:31,157
This is kidnapping, you know?

439
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,701
Do you know how scared
my baby must have been?

440
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:34,869
When did you get the car?

441
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:38,623
Like...

442
00:32:39,582 --> 00:32:42,085
a while... ago, I think.

443
00:32:42,168 --> 00:32:44,170
I paid for it a little before that.

444
00:32:44,754 --> 00:32:47,507
It was before things got so bad.

445
00:32:51,761 --> 00:32:53,096
Say something okay?

446
00:32:53,179 --> 00:32:55,139
Dongjin, don't just give me that look.

447
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:57,100
As co-owner...

448
00:32:57,183 --> 00:32:59,936
I'm also working hard
to find some cash flow for us.

449
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:02,021
So please don't make me sell my car!

450
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:03,731
You find some money, okay?

451
00:33:05,191 --> 00:33:06,317
I will do what I can.

452
00:33:07,026 --> 00:33:08,945
Hey, did things go well at the bank?

453
00:33:09,028 --> 00:33:10,405
How much are they gonna loan us?

454
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:11,781
Hey, Dongjin!

455
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:15,243
Hey! Can you please just tell me
what's gonna happen with the company?

456
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:26,838
JEIL FUNERAL PARLOR

457
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:33,678
Dongjin, you actually came here?

458
00:33:35,471 --> 00:33:37,598
Nothing good's gonna come outta this.

459
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:05,835
Chulmin.

460
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:08,421
Dongjin is here to see you.

461
00:34:11,674 --> 00:34:13,634
You didn't see him often.

462
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:15,094
Mm.

463
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:16,179
But...

464
00:34:16,804 --> 00:34:18,848
he was always good to you.

465
00:34:18,931 --> 00:34:20,683
You remember, right?

466
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:25,104
You left the world first,
leaving me all alone.

467
00:34:25,688 --> 00:34:28,524
Now, this boy is all I have left.

468
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:34,405
Why did you have to go so early?

469
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:39,410
Tell me why you left me all by myself.

470
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:48,688
Ah, stop it already, it's stupid.

471
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:27,310
Ah, Woojoo, did you do something crazy?

472
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:30,938
I was hoping I wouldn't find you
when I got here.

473
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:33,024
But my hunch was right...

474
00:36:33,107 --> 00:36:35,193
I wish I had been wrong.

475
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:38,362
Like what impulsive decision convinced you

476
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:40,364
that it'd be okay
to dress like that at a funeral?

477
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:43,659
Come on. Why don't you get up?

478
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:59,425
Are you... crying?

479
00:37:09,101 --> 00:37:10,311
Hey, please don't cry.

480
00:37:14,815 --> 00:37:16,108
Go ahead and say it.

481
00:37:17,443 --> 00:37:19,111
"Woojoo, why do you even come?"

482
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:24,825
I tried so hard to hold myself together
so my dad wouldn't see these tears.

483
00:37:26,202 --> 00:37:28,537
And now if they see me here...

484
00:37:29,121 --> 00:37:32,375
they'll think that I'm broken
'cause of his death and that's not why.

485
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:35,878
I didn't want to cry for him at all.

486
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:15,793
You're cruel, you know.

487
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:18,754
You don't visit me once for five years,

488
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:22,258
and it takes someone to die
just for me to see your face?

489
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:39,233
I transferred the money.

490
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:40,818
You should check your bank.

491
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:44,655
I'm sorry.

492
00:38:47,116 --> 00:38:49,410
I know I got married a lot

493
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:52,788
so I guess I didn't offer you
the support you needed.

494
00:38:53,122 --> 00:38:56,959
Though I endured,
much anxiety and pain during your birth.

495
00:38:57,043 --> 00:39:00,379
If you were having a hard time,
you should have talked to me sooner.

496
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:03,716
Why would you be running around
and asking everyone for money like a bum?

497
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:12,266
Where did you get the money though?

498
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:16,354
It wasn't stolen.

499
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:17,521
Just so we're clear.

500
00:39:20,232 --> 00:39:21,484
I'll pay you back.

501
00:39:25,821 --> 00:39:27,823
There were so many people looking.

502
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:30,034
You should have at least gotten a haircut.

503
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:39,585
Okay.

504
00:39:40,753 --> 00:39:42,797
Now you're acting like your dad's son.

505
00:39:49,678 --> 00:39:50,930
Oh, Dongjin.

506
00:39:51,013 --> 00:39:54,141
Let's see each other more often, okay?

507
00:39:56,894 --> 00:40:01,023
You know, I have no one but you now.

508
00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:03,943
That's all. Hm?

509
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:45,818
Hey, before we go,
do you wanna get takeout from our area?

510
00:40:45,901 --> 00:40:48,279
What if the jjajangmyeon
in the new neighborhood sucks?

511
00:40:48,362 --> 00:40:50,698
Yeah, I wouldn't like that at all.

512
00:40:52,658 --> 00:40:54,618
Do you wanna get kang jjajangmyeon
in that case?

513
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:56,078
Yeah, sure, the seafood one.

514
00:40:57,371 --> 00:40:59,999
Oh, in that case,
I'll get some fried rice.

515
00:41:00,082 --> 00:41:01,709
You want sweet and sour pork?

516
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:02,793
Sweet and sour?

517
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:04,712
Huh, let's get a medium size.

518
00:41:09,091 --> 00:41:10,968
Hi, this is the house
with the ginkgo tree out front.

519
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:14,263
I'd like two seafood jjajangmyeon,
a fried rice,

520
00:41:14,346 --> 00:41:16,223
and a medium sweet and sour pork.

521
00:41:17,266 --> 00:41:18,934
And a bottle of Cola
and a bottle of cider.

522
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:19,935
You?

523
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:26,317
Am I weird for debating
whether we should be eating right now?

524
00:41:28,277 --> 00:41:30,112
Do you want something or not?

525
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:31,614
Jjamppong.

526
00:41:32,698 --> 00:41:34,241
And a jjamppong also.

527
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:35,284
Okay.

528
00:42:07,399 --> 00:42:08,817
The Hulk,

529
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:11,028
the psycho,

530
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:12,905
and me, Jigu.

531
00:43:36,488 --> 00:43:41,493
2 MONTHS LATER

532
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:15,778
Mr. Han.

533
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:18,530
What are you doing?

534
00:44:22,242 --> 00:44:24,828
I mean, it's not like you haven't
seen an empty exhibition hall.

535
00:44:25,412 --> 00:44:27,081
What were you so focused about in there?

536
00:44:27,831 --> 00:44:28,916
All that space.

537
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:31,502
But the problem is,
finding ways to fill it.

538
00:44:31,585 --> 00:44:33,921
How can we fill the hall
with just one fair?

539
00:44:34,004 --> 00:44:35,756
What if not enough people attend?

540
00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:39,051
There's this one guy who always...

541
00:44:39,134 --> 00:44:42,096
...avoids the first day of his own fairs,
on purpose I bet.

542
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:44,890
And will you be the same?

543
00:44:47,393 --> 00:44:48,435
Oh, so...

544
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:50,479
Why did you come to see me?

545
00:44:51,772 --> 00:44:53,148
Hall C.

546
00:44:54,108 --> 00:44:55,150
I'd like to reserve it.

547
00:44:55,776 --> 00:44:58,362
What? You've got a new trade show?

548
00:44:58,946 --> 00:45:00,614
Your company is back to normal?

549
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:03,409
-Yes.
-Oh...

550
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:12,042
CEO HAN DONGJIN

551
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:27,057
You're Dongjin's right-hand person
so it makes sense you knew the situation.

552
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:30,602
If Mr. Cha also knew about it,
then I might be kind of hurt.

553
00:45:30,686 --> 00:45:32,020
Mister Choi, can you...

554
00:45:32,104 --> 00:45:34,148
separate your work and personal life?

555
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:36,942
I'm separating them.

556
00:45:37,025 --> 00:45:39,528
This is personal and not okay,
Baek Soohee.

557
00:45:39,611 --> 00:45:41,405
You're my mom's friend's daughter,
seriously,

558
00:45:41,488 --> 00:45:42,781
we literally grew up together, right?

559
00:45:42,865 --> 00:45:44,742
Did you tell him we're holding
our own exhibition?

560
00:45:44,825 --> 00:45:45,826
Yes.

561
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:47,494
Oh, gosh. I'm so sorry.

562
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:49,705
If we're talking about that, well, I knew.

563
00:45:49,788 --> 00:45:52,082
So then, you all knew it?

564
00:45:52,166 --> 00:45:55,127
When I'm also president
and I... was just told?

565
00:45:55,210 --> 00:45:57,838
So, instead of always disappearing,
just show up.

566
00:45:57,921 --> 00:46:00,007
You should be used to it now, huh?
I'm a busy guy, okay?

567
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:03,886
Look, look, look. I see that look again.

568
00:46:07,806 --> 00:46:10,726
What I'm saying is,
we just got an investment,

569
00:46:10,809 --> 00:46:13,061
jumping into another fair too soon
is risky.

570
00:46:13,145 --> 00:46:14,605
Oh, let's face it.

571
00:46:16,315 --> 00:46:17,524
We're pushing our luck.

572
00:46:21,236 --> 00:46:24,031
Bidding on exhibits
will only take us so far.

573
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:25,908
We need to hold our own exhibition

574
00:46:25,991 --> 00:46:28,577
to create a stable revenue source
and prevent debt.

575
00:46:30,871 --> 00:46:32,539
So what is your idea then?

576
00:46:33,999 --> 00:46:35,501
A camping exhibition could be good.

577
00:46:36,168 --> 00:46:38,253
Hmm, it's actually
a growing market right now.

578
00:46:38,337 --> 00:46:41,173
There's expansion potential
with food and drink distributors

579
00:46:41,256 --> 00:46:42,549
and manufacturing companies.

580
00:46:43,008 --> 00:46:44,176
Could be good.

581
00:46:44,802 --> 00:46:46,303
Take a look.

582
00:46:46,386 --> 00:46:49,306
Before you are the companies
I've talked with already.

583
00:46:49,389 --> 00:46:51,975
I've included the contact details
for the major clients

584
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:53,685
so you can arrange meetings right away.

585
00:46:54,061 --> 00:46:55,479
Oh, so when'd you do all this?

586
00:46:55,562 --> 00:46:56,688
When do you think he did it?

587
00:46:56,772 --> 00:46:59,650
I don't show up to work in the office
but he never leaves at all.

588
00:46:59,733 --> 00:47:02,069
And that's why
this is all working so smoothly.

589
00:47:02,152 --> 00:47:04,071
-Are you proud of that?
-Why yes, indeed.

590
00:47:04,154 --> 00:47:06,949
Enough of this meeting,
let's get some lunch I'm hungry.

591
00:47:23,048 --> 00:47:24,383
Just say it.

592
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:26,510
How's the food?

593
00:47:26,593 --> 00:47:28,178
Dongjin? It's bland, right?

594
00:47:29,888 --> 00:47:31,223
Can't we just eat?

595
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:37,271
So...

596
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:39,523
Do you spend time,
camping alone these days?

597
00:47:40,816 --> 00:47:42,276
That's what you wanna know?

598
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:43,944
Is like...

599
00:47:46,071 --> 00:47:47,865
No matter what was going on with you,

600
00:47:47,948 --> 00:47:50,409
remember back in the day,
you were always going camping

601
00:47:50,492 --> 00:47:51,785
every chance you got, yeah?

602
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:54,705
But ever since you broke up with Minyoung,
you haven't camped once.

603
00:47:54,788 --> 00:47:56,081
So I thought,

604
00:47:56,164 --> 00:47:58,542
"Okay, I guess he's done with camping."

605
00:47:59,126 --> 00:48:01,628
That's the reason I wouldn't talk
camping with you, Dongjin,

606
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:03,297
but you mentioned it again today.

607
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:04,548
Is there anything going on with you?

608
00:48:06,425 --> 00:48:09,011
Look, it's just an idea
and it's something that I know.

609
00:48:11,138 --> 00:48:12,180
I was wondering

610
00:48:12,264 --> 00:48:14,141
why did you break up with Minyoung?

611
00:48:18,103 --> 00:48:20,147
Just kidding.
Please ignore my stupidity, eh?

612
00:48:24,067 --> 00:48:27,446
But you do have to tell me about your mom.

613
00:48:27,529 --> 00:48:29,114
Where did she get all that cash anyway?

614
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:32,200
We need to know where
the investment funds are from.

615
00:48:32,284 --> 00:48:34,119
It wasn't stolen.

616
00:48:34,202 --> 00:48:35,746
Just so we're clear.

617
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:37,414
I wouldn't have cared.

618
00:48:38,999 --> 00:48:40,375
Even if she said she stole it,

619
00:48:40,459 --> 00:48:41,960
I probably would've taken it
without thought.

620
00:48:43,295 --> 00:48:45,714
That's why I didn't ask
where she got the money.

621
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:49,426
'Cause we needed it.

622
00:49:11,907 --> 00:49:13,825
Can I have some more tteokbokki, please?

623
00:49:13,909 --> 00:49:15,327
Of course.

624
00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:21,249
-Thank you.
-Yes, have a good day.

625
00:49:21,333 --> 00:49:22,167
Thank you, sir.

626
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:23,502
MG SAEMAEUL FINANCE FIRM
SECTION CHIEF SIM HAESUNG

627
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:33,428
Oh, ma'am.

628
00:49:33,512 --> 00:49:35,263
Uh, did you take a number?

629
00:49:35,931 --> 00:49:37,140
Uh...

630
00:49:37,724 --> 00:49:39,518
Oh, it's all right. I can take her.

631
00:49:39,601 --> 00:49:40,477
Here.

632
00:49:42,896 --> 00:49:43,939
Hello there.

633
00:49:48,568 --> 00:49:51,113
I wanna withdraw all of my money.

634
00:49:51,697 --> 00:49:53,782
Yes. Could you show me your ID?

635
00:50:01,331 --> 00:50:03,208
Oh, may I ask,
if this is your husband's account?

636
00:50:04,543 --> 00:50:05,961
You're something else, aren't ya?

637
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:09,006
What?

638
00:50:09,089 --> 00:50:10,132
Husband?

639
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:11,925
Why yes, exactly.

640
00:50:13,802 --> 00:50:14,928
Uh...

641
00:50:16,138 --> 00:50:17,931
I'm sorry, ma'am. My mistake, sorry.

642
00:50:18,015 --> 00:50:19,307
Keep your mouth shut.

643
00:50:20,183 --> 00:50:21,393
Until I ask you a question.

644
00:50:34,197 --> 00:50:36,199
Ow! My back hurts!

645
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:38,368
Ma'am, please, please, calm down.

646
00:50:38,452 --> 00:50:39,828
-Let go!
-Ma'am, please...

647
00:50:41,204 --> 00:50:43,498
Ma'am, just please stop, ma'am.

648
00:50:43,582 --> 00:50:45,208
-Ma'am, please. Let go of her!
-Please stop...

649
00:50:49,421 --> 00:50:51,840
Uh...

650
00:50:57,888 --> 00:50:59,848
I really don't know anyone
called Park Youngsoo.

651
00:50:59,931 --> 00:51:01,683
What do you mean you don't know who he is?

652
00:51:01,767 --> 00:51:04,853
He was calling you "honey" and "darling"
when he spoke to you late last night.

653
00:51:04,936 --> 00:51:06,438
He's the same guy who lives with me!

654
00:51:06,521 --> 00:51:07,606
No, uh...

655
00:51:07,689 --> 00:51:09,566
-The man I'm seeing is Park Minkyu--
-Park Minkyu!

656
00:51:09,649 --> 00:51:12,110
Park Youngsoo is Park Minkyu.

657
00:51:12,194 --> 00:51:13,862
Minkyu's his nickname,
his real name's Youngsoo!

658
00:51:14,988 --> 00:51:16,490
Don't tell me you didn't know.

659
00:51:16,573 --> 00:51:18,033
-I'm...
-You must have.

660
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:20,202
Ma'am, I really didn't know, I swear.

661
00:51:20,285 --> 00:51:21,745
Who are you calling "Ma'am"?

662
00:51:21,828 --> 00:51:23,872
Don't try to be so polite
in the middle of this mess.

663
00:51:24,581 --> 00:51:26,208
I didn't know...

664
00:51:32,005 --> 00:51:33,256
Well, I, uh...

665
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,051
I would never date someone

666
00:51:36,134 --> 00:51:37,803
who was already seeing
another girl, I swear.

667
00:51:43,517 --> 00:51:45,227
What's all this then?

668
00:51:45,811 --> 00:51:47,104
We're not legally married,

669
00:51:47,187 --> 00:51:49,898
but we've been sleeping
in the same bed for ten years.

670
00:51:49,981 --> 00:51:53,568
I sold cosmetics to provide
for his clothes, food, everything.

671
00:51:53,652 --> 00:51:55,570
I'm the one who gave him his life.

672
00:51:55,654 --> 00:51:58,323
And he says he wants to break up with me
so he can live with you.

673
00:52:17,050 --> 00:52:19,010
You should have come to me sooner.

674
00:52:21,763 --> 00:52:23,765
It must have been so hard for you.

675
00:52:31,189 --> 00:52:32,566
I won't see him again.

676
00:52:36,361 --> 00:52:37,904
Now that I know all this.

677
00:52:41,992 --> 00:52:43,702
I can't believe he did that to you.

678
00:52:43,785 --> 00:52:46,204
You expect me to believe that?

679
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:52,335
Give her a chance.

680
00:52:55,172 --> 00:52:56,631
There's nothing else you can do.

681
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:24,451
If you see her with your husband,

682
00:53:24,534 --> 00:53:26,536
just look for me instead
of looking for her, okay?

683
00:53:27,162 --> 00:53:28,330
It'll be faster.

684
00:53:29,873 --> 00:53:31,416
'Cause I'm her little sister,

685
00:53:31,917 --> 00:53:34,085
and I'll kill her personally
if she sees him again.

686
00:53:47,349 --> 00:53:48,934
This is my cell number.

687
00:53:52,062 --> 00:53:53,939
Can we consider this finished?

688
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:56,816
But let me say one more thing.

689
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:00,487
More than likely,
my sister really didn't know.

690
00:54:01,571 --> 00:54:04,074
And the only reason she let you
beat her up and humiliate her

691
00:54:04,157 --> 00:54:05,450
is because she's so nice.

692
00:54:07,827 --> 00:54:10,622
It's 'cause she knows
it isn't easy hearing it like this.

693
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:13,875
That must be
what's most painful from it all.

694
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:26,054
And, um...

695
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:28,515
I'm not as nice as her.

696
00:54:28,598 --> 00:54:30,267
So don't forget that.

697
00:54:52,872 --> 00:54:53,915
Are you crazy?

698
00:54:53,999 --> 00:54:55,542
Why are you throwing that away?

699
00:54:55,625 --> 00:54:56,960
Hey, Sim Haesung!

700
00:54:57,043 --> 00:54:59,379
Hey, I'm your older sister!
You shouldn't yell at me like that!

701
00:54:59,462 --> 00:55:00,714
Why didn't you use that temper?

702
00:55:00,797 --> 00:55:02,841
I'm appalled that she got the best of you.

703
00:55:03,842 --> 00:55:06,011
I just really like this picture of me.

704
00:55:06,845 --> 00:55:10,307
Well, I'll cut my face out
and then I'll toss the other photos.

705
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:12,100
Come on, you stupid or what?

706
00:55:12,851 --> 00:55:15,854
So tell me, how is it that
all your relationships are so horrible?

707
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:19,733
I don't have to explain myself,

708
00:55:19,816 --> 00:55:22,068
especially 'cause you think guys
are just like our cheating dad.

709
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:24,154
Even if I did explain myself,
you just don't get it.

710
00:55:24,237 --> 00:55:26,031
Well, you don't date, so back off, Woojoo.

711
00:55:27,407 --> 00:55:29,868
I think I consider myself quite lucky.

712
00:55:29,951 --> 00:55:31,494
And I think I'm luckier than you are.

713
00:55:31,578 --> 00:55:33,204
Then at least meet someone that's decent!

714
00:55:33,288 --> 00:55:35,290
Why do you always go
for pathetic dogs like that one?

715
00:55:35,373 --> 00:55:36,708
I'm year of the horse!

716
00:55:37,459 --> 00:55:38,877
Dog signs are a match, okay?

717
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:47,135
Oh, wait. I have to go
to the pharmacy too.

718
00:55:47,218 --> 00:55:48,803
Yeah, well, I quit working there.

719
00:55:49,387 --> 00:55:50,347
What?

720
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:52,015
Then where do you work now?

721
00:55:53,016 --> 00:55:53,933
Huh?

722
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:38,061
Beige pantyhose.

723
00:56:48,863 --> 00:56:51,282
TAERANG

724
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:22,730
Hey. Who is she?

725
00:57:30,822 --> 00:57:34,325
Uh, Miss? May I ask, do you know this guy?

726
00:57:35,201 --> 00:57:37,704
Yes, uh, actually quite well.

727
00:57:38,705 --> 00:57:40,415
What? Is that true?

728
00:57:40,498 --> 00:57:42,917
Then may I ask
how you know each other then?

729
00:57:44,669 --> 00:57:47,547
He's helping me with my stuff,
so perhaps we know each other.

730
00:57:51,176 --> 00:57:52,677
Oh, you really don't know her?

731
00:57:54,471 --> 00:57:56,097
Well, should I? I can't recall.

732
00:57:56,514 --> 00:57:59,100
Uh... Have we met somewhere already?

733
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:02,562
I, uh, suppose here and there.

734
00:58:02,645 --> 00:58:04,731
I'm around until about six each day.

735
00:58:04,814 --> 00:58:05,690
Huh?

736
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:09,360
Oh, the rumor must be true about you.

737
00:58:09,777 --> 00:58:11,070
Uh, what rumor?

738
00:58:12,155 --> 00:58:13,948
You go to work like you go to the gym.

739
00:58:31,799 --> 00:58:33,343
BEST FAIRS

740
00:58:33,426 --> 00:58:34,511
What's this?

741
00:58:34,594 --> 00:58:36,095
She works for us?

742
00:58:36,638 --> 00:58:38,473
She's a part-time office assistant.

743
00:58:38,556 --> 00:58:40,266
She's been here for a week now.

744
00:58:48,775 --> 00:58:49,859
How old is she?

745
00:58:51,402 --> 00:58:53,446
Why do you wanna know so bad?

746
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:56,157
She's too old for part-time
and she seems really tough.

747
00:58:57,242 --> 00:59:00,787
She already knew exactly who I was,
but she didn't even flinch for a second.

748
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:03,122
And besides,
what's with her attitude anyway,

749
00:59:03,206 --> 00:59:04,207
the way she talks?

750
00:59:04,290 --> 00:59:05,708
I'm not sure if she was joking or not.

751
00:59:08,169 --> 00:59:09,379
Sunwoo.

752
00:59:12,549 --> 00:59:14,801
Yeah, I was planning to head out anyway.

753
00:59:14,884 --> 00:59:17,804
The second you put on glasses,
it's my cue to go.

754
00:59:21,266 --> 00:59:23,101
Since this is the attitude I get,

755
00:59:23,184 --> 00:59:25,144
I'm not that surprised
she's acting like that too.

756
00:59:26,521 --> 00:59:27,730
It's just for three months.

757
00:59:28,815 --> 00:59:31,568
It's a temporary position,
a three-month contract.

758
00:59:31,651 --> 00:59:32,569
No extensions.

759
00:59:42,287 --> 00:59:44,497
Excuse me, you get my pantyhose?

760
00:59:45,123 --> 00:59:45,957
No.

761
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:47,834
Didn't you get my text?

762
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:51,796
Oh, look at that. Why yes, you did.

763
00:59:53,006 --> 00:59:55,008
Well, yes, I did.
I didn't get them for you.

764
00:59:56,342 --> 00:59:57,969
I would have if you had written,

765
00:59:58,052 --> 01:00:00,346
"Woojoo, could you please
get me some pantyhose?"

766
01:00:01,055 --> 01:00:02,974
It was the way you said it.

767
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:05,560
It felt like you were giving me an order.

768
01:00:06,477 --> 01:00:08,021
I felt offended by that.

769
01:00:09,939 --> 01:00:11,774
I was in a hurry at that time, I...

770
01:00:16,112 --> 01:00:19,073
Mister Cha, I really don't like her.

771
01:00:19,157 --> 01:00:20,742
Well, she's a good asset to us.

772
01:00:20,825 --> 01:00:22,994
Yeah, so what?
She's just a part-timer though.

773
01:00:24,537 --> 01:00:26,706
I don't think
she's a typical part-timer.

774
01:00:26,789 --> 01:00:29,459
Our team leader's picking
her assignments personally.

775
01:00:32,253 --> 01:00:33,796
This is reference material.

776
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:35,465
Can you read and summarize it?

777
01:00:35,548 --> 01:00:37,967
It'll be good for you
to have some background knowledge.

778
01:00:38,051 --> 01:00:38,885
Okay.

779
01:00:38,968 --> 01:00:42,055
Ms. Baek doesn't even call you
by name if you're not good enough.

780
01:00:42,513 --> 01:00:44,557
It took you, what?
Three months too, right?

01:01:37,151 --> 01:01:39,237
You should either blow your nose
or clean your eyes.

787
01:01:40,488 --> 01:01:41,489
Am I dirty?

788
01:01:41,572 --> 01:01:44,659
Oh, um, it's not the most clean.

789
01:01:45,326 --> 01:01:46,994
Why am I dirty, though?

790
01:01:47,078 --> 01:01:49,414
Married cheating assholes
should be instead.

791
01:01:49,497 --> 01:01:52,667
They're all just pieces of trash
that you can't recycle.

792
01:01:52,750 --> 01:01:54,544
They all have to be put out
into a trash bag

793
01:01:54,627 --> 01:01:56,462
and then thrown away!

794
01:02:01,843 --> 01:02:02,885
So then...

795
01:02:03,886 --> 01:02:04,971
then why...

796
01:02:06,013 --> 01:02:09,016

Oh, what's she doing
that's too important for her

805
01:03:01,903 --> 01:03:03,196
to pick up the phone?

806
01:03:03,279 --> 01:03:05,156
How am I gonna handle her by myself?

807
01:03:08,743 --> 01:03:10,077
JUN

808
01:03:14,832 --> 01:03:17,210
HISTORIC SITE OF DECLARATION
OF INDEPENDENCE

809
01:03:57,959 --> 01:03:59,418
You gonna stand there all day?

810
01:04:02,088 --> 01:04:04,173
Don't look into it any further.

811
01:04:04,257 --> 01:04:05,925
You told me you met with that woman.

812
01:04:06,801 --> 01:04:08,678
Yeah, I went to talk to her.

813
01:04:08,761 --> 01:04:09,720
I met her, okay?

814
01:04:10,847 --> 01:04:12,849
Your dad put the deed in her name
before he died,

815
01:04:12,932 --> 01:04:14,517
so you kids don't have any claim.

816
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:15,768
Even if you did,

817
01:04:15,852 --> 01:04:18,688
she already sold the house
and funded her son's company.

818
01:04:18,771 --> 01:04:20,898
She's a terrible woman,

819
01:04:20,982 --> 01:04:22,441
but she still loves her son.

820
01:04:23,484 --> 01:04:24,777
I also heard...

821
01:04:24,861 --> 01:04:27,154
You spent all your money
on your mom's treatment

822
01:04:27,238 --> 01:04:28,656
and that house was all you had.

823
01:04:28,739 --> 01:04:30,199
I don't understand my brother.

824
01:04:30,283 --> 01:04:32,076
Why did he have to marry a gold digger...

825
01:04:32,827 --> 01:04:33,870
I'm outta here.

826
01:04:34,704 --> 01:04:36,706
JUHEE HAIRLINE

827
01:04:40,209 --> 01:04:41,502
Woojoo, hey, wait!

828
01:04:43,796 --> 01:04:44,839
Here.

829
01:04:44,922 --> 01:04:46,716
Her son's business card.

830
01:04:46,799 --> 01:04:49,594
When he came to the funeral hall
I made sure to get it.

831
01:04:51,095 --> 01:04:54,348
You know, actually, he seems
totally different than she is.

832
01:04:55,099 --> 01:04:56,309
You could ask him for some money.

833
01:04:56,976 --> 01:04:58,394
Hey, who knows?

834
01:04:58,477 --> 01:05:00,897
Maybe he can right his mother's wrong?

835
01:05:01,772 --> 01:05:03,107
If he was different
from his mother,

836
01:05:03,190 --> 01:05:04,817
he shouldn't have taken the money.

837
01:05:06,027 --> 01:05:08,696
He would have known
where that money came from.

838
01:05:10,406 --> 01:05:12,700
It's simply "like mother, like son."

839
01:05:20,458 --> 01:05:21,626
Hey, do you remember?

840
01:05:21,709 --> 01:05:24,211
Maybe your sophomore year of high school?

841
01:05:24,837 --> 01:05:27,214
You know, when you wore
that expensive pair of shoes to school

842
01:05:27,298 --> 01:05:29,133
and that day some bullies took them away?

843
01:05:29,550 --> 01:05:31,385
The one who went
and got them back was Woojoo.

844
01:05:32,929 --> 01:05:33,930
Was it really her?

845
01:05:35,681 --> 01:05:37,433
Those kids were known

846
01:05:37,516 --> 01:05:40,895
to be the strongest and meanest
in Seodaemun District those days.

847
01:05:41,938 --> 01:05:44,523
She chased those guys for a whole month
to get those back for you.

848
01:05:45,524 --> 01:05:48,611
Wow, she's totally crazy.

849
01:05:48,694 --> 01:05:50,863
-Right?
-Not an ordinary crazy...

850
01:05:50,947 --> 01:05:53,532
but a terrifyingly diligent psycho.

851
01:06:07,964 --> 01:06:09,298
First floor.

852
01:06:25,982 --> 01:06:28,859
She went through all that trouble
just to get a pair of shoes back,

853
01:06:28,943 --> 01:06:31,237
but now, she's lost her house.

854
01:06:33,197 --> 01:06:37,201
Do you really think that psycho
would just sit idly by?

855
01:06:41,414 --> 01:06:44,750
I really... wanna be on your team.

856
01:06:49,422 --> 01:06:51,382
She's a part-time office assistant.

857
01:06:51,465 --> 01:06:53,467
She's been here for a week now.

858
01:06:59,265 --> 01:07:00,683
Of course not.

859
01:07:36,177 --> 01:07:37,595
Apartment 2701.

860
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:45,519
If you're looking for my place,

861
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:48,147
it's apartment 2701.
