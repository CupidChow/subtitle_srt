(intro theme music playing)

00:00:52,635 --> 00:00:54,637
(music fades out)

3
00:00:56,473 --> 00:01:00,977
CALL IT LOVE

00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:04,355
{\an8}FINAL EPISODE

5
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:07,609
{\an8}(foot dragging)

6
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:11,571
{\an8}(mellow music playing)

7
00:01:11,654 --> 00:01:13,656
{\an8}(foot continues dragging)

8
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:21,206
{\an8}HYUNJU:
<i>Woojoo had everyone leave the house.</i>

9
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:25,502
{\an8}She said that it would make you suffer
and feel uncomfortable.

10
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:29,964
{\an8}I was inconsiderate, wasn't I?

11
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,134
{\an8}Don't worry about it, ma'am.

12
00:01:36,304 --> 00:01:37,138
How's Heeja?

13
00:01:38,723 --> 00:01:40,558
She's preparing for the trial.

14
00:01:42,393 --> 00:01:43,603
She must be having a hard time.

15
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:46,689
So…

16
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:51,111
I came to tell you
that you really don't need to

17
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:53,863
worry about me anymore.

18
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,787
You've been kind more than enough to me,
and any more than that…

19
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:03,998
would make me feel really guilty.

20
00:02:04,582 --> 00:02:06,000
I didn't do anything.

21
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:11,589
Thank you for the food from last time,
it was really good.

22
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:23,685
Call me if there's anything
you'd like to eat.

23
00:02:25,186 --> 00:02:26,437
I'll make it anytime you want.

24
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:28,481
It's because

25
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:31,901
I feel bad and grateful to you.

26
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:41,035
The soup is getting cold.
Let me heat it up.

27
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:51,838
Go ahead and eat first.

28
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:09,898
Thank you for the meal.

29
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:24,370
(security system beeping)

30
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:33,129
(calling beep, ringing tone)

31
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:34,214
(sighs)

32
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:37,091
Where are you?

33
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,511
I'm nearby.

34
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:46,684
(Dongjin inhales)

35
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:49,979
I quit the company.

36
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:53,983
I worked hard with no regrets,

37
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:58,404
and I quit because I wanted
to take a break.

38
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,250
(Dongjin smacks lips and inhales)

39
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:13,962
I wanted to call you…

40
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:15,296
WOOJOO: I understand.

41
00:04:32,563 --> 00:04:33,481
Maybe I thought

42
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,985
this moment would never come.

43
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:43,783
I don't think I'm ready yet.

44
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,127
Will you give me some time?

45
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:55,920
(music builds)

46
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:00,967
I'll wait.

47
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:21,487
(sighs)

48
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:24,782
HEEJA'S ATTORNEY: I think you might want
to contact Mr. Sim Chulmin's children.

49
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:27,827
Transferring ownership can be tried under
document forgery charges.

50
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:30,705
On top of that, there is evidence
of your attempt to sell the house,

51
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:32,415
which makes everything
even more difficult.

52
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:35,626
It's safer for the trial to get at least
a non-punishment application letter

53
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:36,961
from Mr. Sim's children.

54
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:40,131
Please find other alternatives too.

55
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:44,093
I'll do what I can, but since Mr. Kang
doesn't want to withdraw his report,

56
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:45,887
<i>you have to be prepared just in case</i>

57
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:47,347
<i>to avoid imprisonment.</i>

58
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:49,307
(chair clashing)

59
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:55,229
- Yes, ma'am. Have a good day.
- WOMAN: Okay, thank you.

60
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:57,148
Come again. (laughs)

61
00:05:57,231 --> 00:05:58,775
JUHEE HAIRLINE

62
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:00,318
(sighs)

63
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:04,238
- (door closes)
- (sighs)

64
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:09,160
Wait there for a hundred days
and see if I give you their phone numbers.

65
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:11,204
(popping)

66
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:29,555
Did you have a good talk
with Mr. Han Dongjin?

67
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:37,522
I'll be your confessional,

68
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:40,024
so let out anything you want.

69
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:42,402
(gulping)

70
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:48,324
I was going to tell him today...

71
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,369
it was the right thing to do
to break up with him.

72
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:56,207
I was all ready to do it
and even met up with him.

73
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:58,292
(slow-mo footsteps echoing)

74
00:07:08,052 --> 00:07:09,345
But I couldn't do it.

75
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,308
I was ready.

76
00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:18,729
But I asked him for some time.

77
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:23,067
Is that funny?

78
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:24,819
Why would that be funny?

79
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:26,696
It's sad.

80
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:33,244
Do you regret ever meeting him?

81
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:36,956
No.

82
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:39,834
I don't regret that.

83
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:42,420
But…

84
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:45,298
there are times
when I want to go back to the past

85
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:48,050
and stop myself from doing certain things.

86
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:54,390
Like how I was dressed
when I went to my father's funeral.

87
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:55,475
JEIL FUNERAL PARLOR

88
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:58,102
WOOJOO: <i>I regret that.</i>

89
00:07:58,186 --> 00:08:00,146
(inaudible crying)

90
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:04,525
If I could go back,

91
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:09,071
I would dress more appropriately

92
00:08:11,073 --> 00:08:13,493
and pay my respects properly too.

93
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:18,247
Instead of taking
haphazard revenge like a child…

94
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:24,170
I wish I could just let go of
all my past there.

95
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:31,469
It's not too late.

96
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:34,347
Let it go now.

97
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:36,641
It will at least…

98
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:39,936
make you feel better.

99
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:56,202
(cans clashing lightly)

100
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:00,039
(gulping)

101
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:09,173
(light tapping)

102
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:13,761
CEO CHOI SUNWOO

103
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:16,347
SHARE TRANSFER AGREEMENT

104
00:09:19,475 --> 00:09:21,185
(sighs deeply)

105
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:26,440
TAERANG BUILDING

106
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:43,457
(calling beep and ringing tone)

107
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:46,919
SUNWOO: <i>I knew you would call.
Just come up here.</i>

108
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:49,589
(hanging-up beep)

109
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:03,728
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

110
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:06,480
SEPTEMBER 20, 2022
CEO: HAN DONGJIN

111
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:07,815
(Sunwoo exhales deeply)

112
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:10,526
(clears throat and smacks lips)

113
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:11,611
So…

114
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:16,866
Minyoung is set to come to work
starting next week.

115
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:18,534
She's under a project contract.

116
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,703
We'll just work together on the art fair.

117
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:22,496
DONGJIN: Okay.

118
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,206
(Sunwoo smacks lips)

119
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,249
As for the camping fair,

120
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:28,044
we'll keep working
with the magazine company

121
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:29,837
for the first half of the year,

122
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,631
and work with Kinex for the other half.

123
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:34,300
We'll make it routine, twice a year.

124
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:37,386
You don't have to report that to me.

125
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:39,263
I'll look it up on the news.

126
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:40,514
Look what up on the news?

127
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:44,310
I'm going to call you and report on
everything until your ears fall off.

128
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:50,149
That way you'll be able to
catch up quickly when you come back.

129
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:53,819
- Sunwoo.
- No.

130
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,154
Don't say anything.

131
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:58,074
I want to have that hope.

132
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:02,953
I'm keeping your office
and nameplate untouched.

133
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:04,955
It's not to make you feel burdened.

134
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:07,667
It'd be nice to have a place
to come back to.

135
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:11,629
Also…

136
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:14,757
stop by your office before you leave.

137
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,343
Everyone's waiting for you there.

138
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:26,060
(staff cheering and applauding)

139
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:34,068
SUNWOO: The employees felt bad
about not throwing you a farewell party,

140
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:35,611
so they arranged this.

141
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:37,446
YURI: Mr. Han, we were really hurt.

142
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,407
How could you not even say goodbye?

143
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:42,076
- I almost drunk-dialed you.
- (laughter)

144
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:44,161
They say everything's better
with a celebration.

145
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:46,205
(tender music playing)

146
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:49,542
Blow them out. The candles are burning.

147
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:53,713
- (puffs)
- (cheering and applause)

148
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:55,089
YURI: Congratulations!

149
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:57,174
SUNWOO: Say something.

150
00:11:57,675 --> 00:12:00,302
But don't cry.
If you do, there might be a flood here.

151
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:01,846
(staff chuckling)

152
00:12:06,308 --> 00:12:11,647
CONGRATULATIONS ON
BECOMING A FREE MAN, CEO HAN!

153
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:13,107
"A free man."

154
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:16,026
I like that.

155
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:20,698
I could endure thanks to all of you.

156
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:28,080
And I sincerely thank you for everything.

157
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:32,334
I'll be rooting for you.

158
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:34,336
We're grateful too.

159
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:37,089
(staff applauding)

160
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:43,596
SUNWOO: Don't you all just go home.

161
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:44,722
STAFF: Okay.

162
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:47,057
(staff murmuring)

163
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:48,851
SUNWOO: Good job. Thanks.

164
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:49,810
YURI: Sure.

165
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:54,064
(office chairs rolling)

166
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:07,161
SOOHEE: CEO Shin once asked me

167
00:13:08,245 --> 00:13:10,790
why I switched to this company.

168
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:14,960
Back then, I told him
it was to escape from him.

169
00:13:15,836 --> 00:13:20,549
But now that I think about it,
I actually followed you to Best Fairs.

170
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:24,303
I wanted to work with
someone that I could respect.

171
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:30,309
Hey, Soohee. You're hurting my feelings.

172
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:33,604
I thought you came because of me.

173
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:37,358
I'll be taking good care of Best Fairs
with CEO Choi…

174
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:38,442
(whispers)
…so don't worry.

175
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:42,404
I won't worry.

176
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:44,448
Okay.

177
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:58,504
SUNWOO: Go on then.

178
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:06,512
Sunwoo.

179
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:09,640
I'm not coming back.

180
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:13,686
I want to live a different life.

181
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:17,773
(Sunwoo hesitates)

182
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,233
I… (sighs)

183
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:21,402
I got you.

184
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:23,571
Sorry.

185
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:26,574
What do you have to be sorry for?
I'm the one to apologize.

186
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:30,202
You've worked really hard.

187
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:32,329
Thanks for everything.

188
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,583
(giggles)

189
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:52,099
(feet pacing)

190
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:56,812
(sighs disapprovingly)

191
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:59,565
JUHEE HAIRLINE

192
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:01,692
(sighs exasperatedly)

193
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:06,614
AUNT (on phone): <i>I'm telling you
she's been out there for three days.</i>

194
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:10,034
<i>I mean, she came asking
for your number specifically</i>

195
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:12,536
<i>and asked to meet you just once.</i>

196
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,830
She wanted to ask you for
a non-punishment…

197
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:19,543
Non-punishment something,
that's what she's asking for.

198
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,629
<i>She needs that to avoid going to prison.</i>

199
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:22,922
Is that what she said?

200
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:24,840
AUNT: <i>How else would I know this?</i>

201
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:29,470
Hey, she's still standing outside.

202
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:33,515
Gosh, does she have no shame at all?

203
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:36,810
AUNT (whimpers): <i>I'm not giving her
your contact information.</i>

204
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:39,855
Thinking about my poor brother,
I can't give it to her.

205
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:43,943
Woojoo. You can't ever forgive that woman.

206
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:47,363
AUNT: <i>You remember how shameless
that woman was at the funeral, right?</i>

207
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:50,199
(shouts) You should have been
more ruthless and made a scene

208
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:51,617
and acted meaner back then.

209
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,827
AUNT: <i>You were too nice.</i>

210
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:57,748
(hanging-up beep)

211
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:03,963
HEEJA: Ow, my feet…

212
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:05,547
Ow.

213
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:10,344
(sighs)

214
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:19,144
WOOJOO: <i>You look well.</i>

215
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:22,022
Like someone
who's forgotten all about the past.

216
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:26,151
What do you mean by that?

217
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:27,653
(tense music playing)

218
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,742
(running footsteps)

219
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:36,662
You're her, right?
The employee at Dongjin's company.

220
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:42,292
Mr. Sim Chulmin's daughter, Sim Woojoo.

221
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:46,714
Mr. Sim Chulmin's daughter, Sim Woojoo.

222
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:48,924
Remember?

223
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:51,051
Remember?

224
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:54,221
(flustered mumbling)

225
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,849
(hesitating)

226
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:59,601
(dumbfounded exclaims)

227
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:05,274
(sighs)

228
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:10,446
(glass slams)

229
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:12,239
(scoffs)

230
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:14,074
Are you satisfied now?

231
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:16,035
Does this make you feel better?

232
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:17,786
Not even close.

233
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:20,080
You want something more?

234
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:22,750
(sighs)

235
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:26,003
The way I see it, you've had
more than enough of your revenge.

236
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:30,132
I'm ruined without a single penny,

237
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:33,385
and you coaxed my son
to get your house back.

238
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:39,892
How much more do I need to suffer
for you to be satisfied?

239
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:42,352
Tell me!

240
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:47,733
(glass lands lightly)

241
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,031
You know…

242
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:57,034
Since I was 17,

243
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,995
I've had a rough life because of you.

244
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:05,292
You have no idea
how badly you have destroyed my life.

245
00:18:07,961 --> 00:18:11,632
You robbed me years of
a peaceful and ordinary life.

246
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:15,344
And you think my anger
would be easily resolved?

247
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:16,804
(scoffs)

248
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:18,347
WOOJOO: But…

249
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:21,892
(resolute music playing)

250
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:28,565
I wonder why I hated only you so much.

251
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:33,862
The person who truly wronged me
was my dad.

252
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,620
I think it was because
you were easier to hate.

253
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:46,333
Hating you was easier

254
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:50,170
and more doable than hating my own father.

255
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:55,717
And that's why I did all those things.

256
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:03,225
HEEJA: I can't understand
a thing you're saying.

257
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:07,229
I'm in love with Mr. Han Dongjin.

258
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:13,318
It's not like I didn't know
he was your son.

259
00:19:15,028 --> 00:19:18,031
I knew well that he'd be hurt,
but I couldn't stop.

260
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:20,909
(hesitating)

261
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:21,827
You…

262
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:23,453
I won't apologize to you.

263
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:25,581
Because I'm not sorry.

264
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:31,170
But instead, I will stop hating

265
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:36,216
and resenting you from today onwards.

266
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:39,219
Also,

267
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:43,140
I'll wish you a good life.

268
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,226
I mean that sincerely.

269
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:50,189
(sighs and inhales dumbfoundedly)

270
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:02,659
(glass slams)

271
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:18,592
WOOJOO: I'll send you the non-punishment
application letter via mail.

272
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:25,766
(sighs)

273
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:29,686
Okay.

274
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:33,690
You have a good life.

275
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:48,538
(whimpering)

276
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:58,632
(pouring)

277
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:00,008
(bottle thuds)

278
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:03,220
(gulping)

279
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:06,098
(glass thuds lightly)

280
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:07,849
(sniffles)

281
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:18,360
(music fades out)

282
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:34,876
Don't worry about the trial so much.
The lawyer--

283
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,879
HEEJA: I met Sim Woojoo.

284
00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:42,592
I was scared
when they said I could be imprisoned.

285
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:48,807
So I went to ask her
for a non-punishment application letter.

286
00:21:55,063 --> 00:21:56,148
(sighs)

287
00:21:56,231 --> 00:21:57,232
(inhales)

288
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:00,277
Dongjin…

289
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:05,032
were you in love with her too?

290
00:22:08,618 --> 00:22:09,453
Yes.

291
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:16,710
Thanks to Ms. Sim Woojoo…

292
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:19,046
(somber music playing)

293
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:24,968
…I was happy for the first time,
and I liked her a lot.

294
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:28,221
(exhales in disbelief)

295
00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:49,076
(door opens)

296
00:22:50,827 --> 00:22:51,787
(door shuts)

297
00:22:53,288 --> 00:22:54,331
(whimpers)

298
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:02,464
(sniffles)

299
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:24,277
(music fades out)

300
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:28,156
(Jun inhales)

301
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:31,284
JUN: Since when are you so diligent?

302
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:33,912
It's not like you're moving out tomorrow.
Take it slow.

303
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:37,290
Are you sad to see me leave?

304
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:40,127
If you guys weren't
moving back to the Yeonhui-dong house…

305
00:23:41,628 --> 00:23:42,879
(sighs) I don't know.

306
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:45,715
I'll come bother you
until you're tired of me. Okay?

307
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:50,470
Gosh, you get so lonely.

308
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:52,848
What's with the guitar? Did you buy it?

309
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:55,267
It was a gift.

310
00:23:56,309 --> 00:23:57,310
Dongjin bought it for me.

311
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:04,609
We went out to go buy it
on the day he came over to eat.

312
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:08,029
I think it was some kind of farewell gift.

313
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:11,199
I accepted it so he would feel better.

314
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:17,747
Take it easy.

315
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:45,525
(calling beep)

316
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:50,238
(phone vibrating)

317
00:24:54,409 --> 00:24:55,368
(tapping on phone)

318
00:24:58,997 --> 00:24:59,956
Hello.

319
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:17,766
About that forest trail
you mentioned last time.

320
00:25:20,268 --> 00:25:24,648
In Seosan, there's a campsite
with a long forest trail.

321
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:27,359
That's my favorite place.

322
00:25:27,442 --> 00:25:28,568
Let's go there

323
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:31,112
together another time.

324
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:38,203
WOOJOO: <i>I'd like to go there.</i>

325
00:25:40,747 --> 00:25:42,624
Can we go tomorrow?

326
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:51,216
You don't want to?

327
00:25:55,303 --> 00:25:56,137
Let's go.

328
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:00,308
I'll see you tomorrow.

329
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:11,403
(hanging-up beep)

330
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:13,446
(bright music playing)

331
00:26:14,197 --> 00:26:17,158
(exhales deeply)

332
00:26:47,647 --> 00:26:49,274
WOOJOO: It really is nice.

333
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:53,028
(Dongjin breathes deeply)

334
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:55,238
I didn't expect you to want to come here.

335
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:00,076
I felt like I would burst out crying

336
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,828
if we didn't do anything
before breaking up.

337
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,832
I didn't want to end it with me crying.

338
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:12,672
I won't cry today, no matter what.

339
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:44,788
(music fades out)

340
00:27:47,415 --> 00:27:49,334
I met your mother.

341
00:27:56,299 --> 00:27:57,467
Sometimes,

342
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:02,389
I wondered how
everyone else walked forward…

343
00:28:02,472 --> 00:28:03,515
(rain pattering)

344
00:28:03,598 --> 00:28:08,478
<i>…when I always felt like
I was walking backward.</i>

345
00:28:08,561 --> 00:28:10,313
(uplifting music playing)

346
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:15,652
It was because I had so much hate in me.

347
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:21,408
Once I let that go, I finally realized.

348
00:28:28,581 --> 00:28:30,583
If I hadn't met you,

349
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:34,045
I'd be walking backward
for the rest of my life.

350
00:28:38,591 --> 00:28:41,720
I was scared that I'd be hated…

351
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:46,599
if I revealed who I was.

352
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:52,021
But I was grateful
that you didn't hate me.

353
00:28:53,189 --> 00:28:54,482
(music pauses)

354
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:57,527
(uplifting music resumes)

355
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:11,541
I couldn't hate you
because the love you gave me…

356
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:16,504
was so much bigger…

357
00:29:19,382 --> 00:29:20,842
than the pain you gave me.

358
00:29:27,348 --> 00:29:29,476
I didn't give you anything.

359
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:32,103
I always acted how I felt.

360
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:34,439
(music ends with crescendo)

361
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:39,360
You gave me everything.

362
00:29:41,654 --> 00:29:42,655
(sentimental music playing)

363
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:44,783
WOOJOO: <i>You know how sometimes
you can tell a lot about someone</i>

364
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:45,867
<i>just by the way they walk?</i>

365
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:50,121
I can tell you won't go down
no matter what. I know for sure.

366
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:52,373
Don't do it if you don't want to.

367
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:55,251
I just wish he could live
peacefully from now on.

368
00:29:56,586 --> 00:29:58,838
WOOJOO: <i>I want him to be happy, Mom.</i>

369
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:02,008
Support.

370
00:30:04,093 --> 00:30:05,053
Consolation.

371
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:08,264
WOOJOO (in flashback):
<i>I really like you a lot, Mr. Han.</i>

372
00:30:09,432 --> 00:30:11,434
To the point where
I wish everyone else in the world

373
00:30:12,018 --> 00:30:14,979
would just disappear
and only the two of us would be left.

374
00:30:15,563 --> 00:30:16,397
Love.

375
00:30:20,401 --> 00:30:21,903
You gave me everything.

376
00:30:26,282 --> 00:30:27,575
I'm grateful too.

377
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:31,287
Thank you for loving me.

378
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:45,885
With you saying that,
it really does feel like the end.

379
00:30:50,139 --> 00:30:51,808
(inhales sharply)

380
00:30:51,891 --> 00:30:55,228
Once I move, I won't have any reason
to be in your neighborhood.

381
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:59,691
I will never take a bus
just to eat a bowl of noodles.

382
00:31:04,737 --> 00:31:05,905
I'm sad to hear that.

383
00:31:09,617 --> 00:31:13,037
I shudder at the thought of
watching your boring back

384
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:15,373
wandering around the neighborhood.

385
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:23,381
I'll live a fun life.

386
00:31:27,343 --> 00:31:28,678
And not a boring one.

387
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,440
(Dongjin chuckles)

388
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:48,948
(sentimental music continues)

389
00:32:04,505 --> 00:32:06,507
(music fades out)

390
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:09,594
(footsteps approaching)

391
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:18,603
(footsteps halt)

392
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,617
(inhales)

393
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:35,036
You go ahead.

394
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:41,167
(sentimental song playing)

395
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:50,677
(smacks lips)

396
00:32:55,598 --> 00:32:57,600
(female vocals singing)

397
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:49,068
(feet stepping back)

398
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:54,615
(under breath) I'll be off.

399
00:33:57,618 --> 00:33:58,578
Goodbye.

400
00:34:02,582 --> 00:34:04,625
(sentimental song continues)

401
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:32,862
(slow-mo footsteps)

402
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:46,751
DONGJIN: <i>I'll live a fun life.</i>

403
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,379
<i>And not a boring one.</i>

404
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:57,929
(slow-mo footsteps)

405
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:06,479
(song continues)

406
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:46,686
Didn't I have beer?

407
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:24,098
(song ends)

408
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:26,142
1 YEAR LATER

409
00:36:26,225 --> 00:36:27,143
YOUNGHO: <i>Thank you.</i>

410
00:36:29,228 --> 00:36:30,438
JUN: Ms. Shin Nara.

411
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:31,564
NARA: Yes.

412
00:36:32,064 --> 00:36:35,443
JUN: Take one every morning and evening
for three days. Don't forget.

413
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:37,069
- Mr. Yoon Daeyoung?
- Yes.

414
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:39,572
Okay, take it for six days in the evening.

415
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:43,784
(Jun sighs)

416
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:47,163
- Youngho, go have lunch.
- Okay.

417
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:48,915
Take your time.

418
00:36:48,998 --> 00:36:50,082
YOUNGHO: Thank you.

419
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:52,293
(queuing system chiming)

420
00:36:54,253 --> 00:36:57,006
HAESUNG: Here. Don't forget your ID
and account book.

421
00:36:57,089 --> 00:36:57,924
CUSTOMER: Okay.

422
00:36:58,007 --> 00:37:00,593
- Thank you.
- Have a nice day, ma'am.

423
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:05,306
(Jihyung clears throat)

424
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:07,934
Have lunch with me.
Don't go over to see your boyfriend.

425
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:09,393
Why?

426
00:37:10,853 --> 00:37:11,896
I'm getting married.

427
00:37:11,979 --> 00:37:13,606
- (gasps)
- (Jihyung laughs)

428
00:37:13,689 --> 00:37:15,316
- (muffled) My gosh!
- This is so embarrassing.

429
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:16,901
(phone vibrates)

430
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:22,365
HAESUNG: <i>Jun,
I need to take a rain check on lunch.</i>

431
00:37:22,448 --> 00:37:24,033
<i>Jihyung is getting married.</i>

432
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:28,496
JUN: <i>Don't eat in a hurry and get
a stomach ache. Enjoy your lunch.</i>

433
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:32,833
(puts down phone)

434
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:34,543
- (all cheering)
- NARAE: Looks good.

435
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:35,503
(laughter)

436
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:36,587
EUNHEE: It looks really delicious.

437
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:39,048
NARAE: It looks so good.

438
00:37:39,131 --> 00:37:42,802
I mean, who makes a surprise announcement
like that about her own wedding?

439
00:37:42,885 --> 00:37:44,720
I thought I was the only one
who didn't know.

440
00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:47,056
Come on, that's why I'm buying you lunch.

441
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:49,183
Congratulations, Jihyung.

442
00:37:49,558 --> 00:37:50,685
Thank you.

443
00:37:50,893 --> 00:37:53,562
Did you know
I'm getting married thanks to you?

444
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,773
- Me?
- Mmm-hmm.

445
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:59,110
I used to always easily give up
when it came to dating.

446
00:37:59,193 --> 00:38:01,862
If the guy didn't seem to care much,
I didn't care either.

447
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:06,409
(sighs) So I'd usually give up
before even sharing my feelings.

448
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:08,452
(exhales)

449
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:10,413
But I observed and learned a lot from you.

450
00:38:10,496 --> 00:38:11,330
(laughs)

451
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:14,375
"Okay, I'll keep going without giving up
just like Sim Haesung."

452
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:16,877
"I'll share my feelings
and worry about getting dumped later."

453
00:38:17,169 --> 00:38:18,421
Did you succeed in one go?

454
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:20,006
On my second try.

455
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:21,924
(exclaims)

456
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:23,426
- (pats)
- So you catch the bouquet.

457
00:38:23,509 --> 00:38:24,385
What?

458
00:38:24,927 --> 00:38:25,845
M-Me?

459
00:38:25,928 --> 00:38:27,930
Sure, of course.

460
00:38:28,222 --> 00:38:29,515
Aren't you going to get married?

461
00:38:30,057 --> 00:38:31,600
We're not…

462
00:38:32,101 --> 00:38:34,270
NARAE: Jihyung, where did he propose?

463
00:38:34,353 --> 00:38:36,063
JIHYUNG (sighs): That's a long story.

464
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,277
(tender song playing)

465
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,237
JUN: What delicious food
did you have for lunch?

466
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:44,572
HAESUNG: Beef.

467
00:38:46,782 --> 00:38:48,159
That's a fancy lunch.

468
00:38:48,242 --> 00:38:49,160
(Haesung chuckles)

469
00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:52,538
She said that her getting married
was all thanks to me.

470
00:38:53,247 --> 00:38:55,916
Why? Did you set them up with each other?

471
00:38:56,792 --> 00:38:57,752
No.

472
00:38:57,835 --> 00:38:58,878
(inhales)

473
00:38:58,961 --> 00:39:03,341
My messy past
was an inspiration to someone else.

474
00:39:04,925 --> 00:39:06,177
(both chuckle)

475
00:39:08,971 --> 00:39:10,473
HAESUNG:
<i>She told him about her feelings first,</i>

476
00:39:10,556 --> 00:39:12,975
<i>and she demanded a proposal from him.</i>

477
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:16,187
But the location was really interesting.

478
00:39:17,229 --> 00:39:18,064
Where was it?

479
00:39:18,647 --> 00:39:19,815
The top of the Namsan Tower.

480
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:22,526
The others were saying it was corny--

481
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:23,819
JUN: It's classic.

482
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:25,112
HAESUNG: Right?

483
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:26,906
Ooh. There you go, Jun.

484
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:28,908
I thought the exact same thing.

485
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:31,577
(munching)

486
00:39:36,957 --> 00:39:38,584
- JUN: Haesung.
- Hmm?

487
00:39:39,251 --> 00:39:40,294
Shall we get married?

488
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:42,171
(song stops abruptly)

489
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:46,384
The house is too quiet.

490
00:39:47,927 --> 00:39:49,261
It's hard for me that it's quiet.

491
00:39:50,846 --> 00:39:53,307
If you move in and live with me,
isn't that marriage?

492
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:03,359
- (snorts)
- (spoon scraping)

493
00:40:05,027 --> 00:40:07,071
(munching)

494
00:40:07,738 --> 00:40:08,864
Are you angry?

495
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:11,075
(sighs)

496
00:40:11,158 --> 00:40:13,452
If I run out of here,
I'm afraid it'll look horribly cliché…

497
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:14,954
(exhales)

498
00:40:15,037 --> 00:40:18,165
…which is the only reason
I'm still sitting here and eating.

499
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:21,794
It's not like I'm letting you slide.

500
00:40:27,299 --> 00:40:29,218
(shouts) Do you get married
because you're bored?

501
00:40:29,718 --> 00:40:33,180
Was it all a joke every time you said
you didn't want to get married?

502
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:39,103
I never thought you would ever
even speak about marriage.

503
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:41,939
If it was this easy,
you should have asked a long time ago.

504
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,817
Then I would've proposed to you!

505
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:47,486
I could have gotten us
a ferry on the Han River!

506
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:48,779
(stifles a laugh)

507
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:51,574
You're laughing? Is this funny?

508
00:40:52,825 --> 00:40:54,618
I never knew Sim Haesung was so cute.

509
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:57,037
You're making fun of me?

510
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:02,042
Stay here for the night.

511
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:03,961
(whimsical music playing)

512
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:05,838
Don't go home.

513
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:11,093
(whimpers) Okay.

514
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:16,557
(Jun exhales in relief)

515
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:19,518
(sniffles)

516
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:23,147
When you're alone at home,

517
00:41:24,857 --> 00:41:27,443
sometimes you talk to yourself
and say things you'd only say inside.

518
00:41:29,445 --> 00:41:31,363
"Where did I put my wallet?"

519
00:41:31,947 --> 00:41:33,449
"How is the weather today?"

520
00:41:34,283 --> 00:41:35,618
"Do I have beer?"

521
00:41:37,286 --> 00:41:39,205
I'd say them out loud
without thinking as a habit.

522
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:42,791
When we used to live together,
someone would always reply back.

523
00:41:44,126 --> 00:41:47,338
Once everyone moved out
and I said something like that,

524
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:51,926
I only heard the humming
of the refrigerator, so I almost cried.

525
00:41:54,428 --> 00:41:56,514
Since that day, I've been silent at home.

526
00:41:59,808 --> 00:42:01,143
You're probably the only one

527
00:42:01,227 --> 00:42:03,479
who wants to get married because
he doesn't want to talk to himself.

528
00:42:06,649 --> 00:42:07,942
I mean, that's how it started.

529
00:42:09,401 --> 00:42:10,653
I just…

530
00:42:12,738 --> 00:42:14,740
really like hearing
your voice in this house.

531
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:19,411
I love seeing you
walking around the house…

532
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:23,249
and I wish you didn't
have to go back home.

533
00:42:24,416 --> 00:42:26,418
(chuckles) Am I too childish?

534
00:42:28,003 --> 00:42:29,922
(inhales sharply)

535
00:42:30,005 --> 00:42:30,923
Jun.

536
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:33,592
You acted like such a mature adult

537
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:35,761
but you were just a boy.

538
00:42:36,136 --> 00:42:36,971
A kid.

539
00:42:39,723 --> 00:42:42,768
(whispers) Only you know that I'm a kid.

540
00:42:43,477 --> 00:42:46,230
Maybe it's because I'm tall.
I must not look it.

541
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:51,193
No, it's because you have a nice voice.

542
00:42:51,777 --> 00:42:52,820
You think?

543
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:56,865
It's really low, and even sounds sexy.

544
00:42:57,449 --> 00:42:59,451
And your broad shoulders.

545
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:02,371
Those play a big role.

546
00:43:03,455 --> 00:43:04,957
- (stifles a laugh)
- (giggles)

547
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:07,876
Haesung, you must really love me.

548
00:43:10,129 --> 00:43:11,380
You don't love me?

549
00:43:12,381 --> 00:43:13,424
I do love you.

550
00:43:15,217 --> 00:43:16,427
(giggles)

551
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:22,558
(smooching)

552
00:43:23,517 --> 00:43:24,810
JUN (whispers): So are we getting married?

553
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:28,022
HAESUNG: Yes.

554
00:43:28,647 --> 00:43:29,523
JUN (whispers): Will you marry me?

555
00:43:29,982 --> 00:43:30,858
HAESUNG: Yes.

556
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:32,610
(laughs)

557
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:38,240
RADIO ANNOUNCER:
<i>I have an interesting story for you all.</i>

558
00:43:38,824 --> 00:43:43,954
<i>It's the story about how Native Americans
that ride horses through the vast prairie</i>

559
00:43:44,038 --> 00:43:47,583
<i>sometimes stop to look back behind them.</i>

560
00:43:48,542 --> 00:43:51,795
<i>They do this because
they are waiting for their souls</i>

561
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:53,631
<i>in case they fell behind.</i>

562
00:43:54,506 --> 00:43:56,383
- <i>Quite a romantic rest, isn't it?</i>
- (indistinct chatter)

563
00:43:57,593 --> 00:44:03,474
<i>Taking some time for your soul
after fiercely blazing through your trail.</i>

564
00:44:03,557 --> 00:44:04,642
{\an8}DEPUTY CEO BAEK SOOHEE

565
00:44:04,725 --> 00:44:09,063
{\an8}<i>I wish you could have
that kind of rest as well.</i>

566
00:44:09,813 --> 00:44:11,815
(gentle song playing)

567
00:44:18,238 --> 00:44:19,281
MINYOUNG: Mmm, latte.

568
00:44:21,533 --> 00:44:23,494
YURI: Do you really not want
to go on a blind date?

569
00:44:23,994 --> 00:44:26,372
MINYOUNG (grunts): I'm not interested yet.

570
00:44:26,455 --> 00:44:28,749
YURI: Come on.
Apparently, he looks like Ethan Hawke.

571
00:44:28,832 --> 00:44:31,377
- Ethan Hawke from <i>Before Sunrise</i>?
- Yes.

572
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:33,587
My goodness. I really like that actor.

573
00:44:33,796 --> 00:44:35,547
YURI: Shall I set it up for this weekend?

574
00:44:36,048 --> 00:44:37,591
(breathes nervously)

575
00:44:40,302 --> 00:44:41,679
Kang Minyoung.

576
00:44:43,305 --> 00:44:44,640
Let's go to lunch.

577
00:44:54,483 --> 00:44:56,527
(indistinct chatter)

578
00:44:56,777 --> 00:44:59,196
MINYOUNG: When you're in a good mood,
you call me Minyoung.

579
00:44:59,279 --> 00:45:01,490
And when you're in a bad mood,
you call me Kang Minyoung.

580
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:03,742
You always say my last name then.

581
00:45:05,035 --> 00:45:06,203
SUNWOO: I know that too.

582
00:45:08,497 --> 00:45:11,083
(smacks lips)
I looked it up in the elevator earlier,

583
00:45:11,834 --> 00:45:13,669
and apparently, Ethan Hawke
was born in 1970.

584
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:17,673
So I don't think I can go on that date.

585
00:45:18,257 --> 00:45:19,758
He's much too old for me.

586
00:45:20,467 --> 00:45:22,678
(laughs awkwardly)

587
00:45:22,761 --> 00:45:24,346
I like things the way they are right now.

588
00:45:25,639 --> 00:45:28,100
I'm working and feeling alive.

589
00:45:28,934 --> 00:45:33,188
I have someone who goes to lunch with me.

590
00:45:35,357 --> 00:45:36,233
Yes.

591
00:45:38,485 --> 00:45:42,114
I like things the way they are now too.

592
00:45:45,451 --> 00:45:47,453
(upbeat music playing)

593
00:45:56,587 --> 00:46:00,632
RICE COOKER VOICE: <i>The rice is ready.
Switching to heat mode.</i>

594
00:46:12,895 --> 00:46:14,354
JIGU (hollers): Breakfast!

595
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:21,236
Sim Woojoo! Sim Haesung! Breakfast!

596
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:22,154
(door opens)

597
00:46:22,237 --> 00:46:23,113
WOOJOO: I'm coming.

598
00:46:24,198 --> 00:46:27,242
(footsteps descending)

599
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:35,417
JIGU: Why are you dressed like that?
Aren't you going to work?

600
00:46:35,501 --> 00:46:36,794
I'm going straight to the site.

601
00:46:36,877 --> 00:46:38,295
You should wake Haesung up.

602
00:46:42,841 --> 00:46:43,884
Wow.

603
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:46,011
Now she just spends a night out
without a word.

604
00:46:48,222 --> 00:46:49,556
No breakfast for me, sorry.

605
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:52,851
Oh, oh. Wait. At least have some cereal.

606
00:46:52,935 --> 00:46:54,061
I'm busy. Bye.

607
00:46:56,271 --> 00:46:57,564
(groans)

608
00:46:57,648 --> 00:46:59,191
(footsteps recede, door opens)

609
00:46:59,274 --> 00:47:00,108
Bye.

610
00:47:00,192 --> 00:47:02,236
(footsteps recede, door shuts)

611
00:47:03,987 --> 00:47:05,989
(uplifting music playing)

612
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:13,497
(security system beeping)

613
00:47:19,878 --> 00:47:20,921
(gate opens)

614
00:47:28,178 --> 00:47:30,180
(uplifting music builds)

615
00:47:33,392 --> 00:47:34,893
(roller approaching)

616
00:47:38,355 --> 00:47:41,650
2023 RE-START
RETURN TO FARMING AND HOME VILLAGE FAIR

617
00:47:43,902 --> 00:47:45,946
(music subdues)

618
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:47,656
WOOJOO: Excuse me, one moment.

619
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:48,782
MAN 1: What's the matter?

620
00:47:49,783 --> 00:47:52,077
Are you using two-sided tape
to put these posters up?

621
00:47:52,578 --> 00:47:54,663
That's the only way they stay up.

622
00:47:54,746 --> 00:47:57,916
We explained that you cannot use
reusable assembled booth walls.

623
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,918
By the way, who are you?

624
00:48:00,002 --> 00:48:03,672
I'm an employee of a fair company
that takes down and rebuilds these walls.

625
00:48:03,755 --> 00:48:05,132
Take them down and erase the marks.

626
00:48:05,465 --> 00:48:07,092
Otherwise, you'll have to buy these walls.

627
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:09,428
Okay, I understand.

628
00:48:10,012 --> 00:48:11,054
Have a good day.

629
00:48:20,105 --> 00:48:22,649
SOOHEE: It looks like
you've really gotten into this field.

630
00:48:22,858 --> 00:48:24,067
I still have a long way to go.

631
00:48:24,818 --> 00:48:28,071
(sighs) I shouldn't have introduced you
to this company.

632
00:48:28,155 --> 00:48:29,531
I wish you'd just join us.

633
00:48:29,615 --> 00:48:30,532
(giggles)

634
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:33,243
You seem happy.

635
00:48:35,662 --> 00:48:37,372
Back when I worked at Best Fairs,

636
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:40,667
I used to wonder

637
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:42,836
why Yuri was so happy

638
00:48:43,337 --> 00:48:45,130
seeing the camping fair posters.

639
00:48:45,631 --> 00:48:47,090
I'm like that nowadays.

640
00:48:48,258 --> 00:48:50,385
I get emotional
just looking at the booth maps.

641
00:48:51,386 --> 00:48:52,596
(giggles)

642
00:48:52,679 --> 00:48:54,181
That makes me happy too.

643
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:02,397
Did you get word about CEO Han?

644
00:49:04,024 --> 00:49:05,025
No.

645
00:49:05,817 --> 00:49:06,860
I haven't heard anything.

646
00:49:11,031 --> 00:49:13,033
(gulping)

647
00:49:16,453 --> 00:49:18,455
(sentimental music playing)

648
00:49:46,858 --> 00:49:48,860
(sentimental music continues)

649
00:50:23,353 --> 00:50:26,106
TAERANG BUILDING

650
00:50:28,108 --> 00:50:32,988
Shortly after CEO Han quit the company,
he moved out of his house.

651
00:50:33,947 --> 00:50:37,868
I found out recently myself,
but he's living in the Gyeonggi-do area.

652
00:50:39,161 --> 00:50:41,163
(footsteps approaching)

653
00:50:49,296 --> 00:50:51,590
(sentimental music continues)

654
00:50:57,679 --> 00:50:59,681
(music subdues)

655
00:51:05,771 --> 00:51:07,564
(slurping)

656
00:51:16,948 --> 00:51:18,325
(footsteps approaching)

657
00:51:19,868 --> 00:51:21,953
(snorts) Wow.

658
00:51:22,788 --> 00:51:24,456
What brings Sim Woojoo
to this neighborhood?

659
00:51:25,165 --> 00:51:25,999
To see you.

660
00:51:26,792 --> 00:51:28,543
You came to see me empty-handed?

661
00:51:29,127 --> 00:51:31,004
- You want me to go get some coffee?
- Forget it.

662
00:51:39,346 --> 00:51:40,597
(Jun grunts)

663
00:51:42,390 --> 00:51:43,391
So then.

664
00:51:43,475 --> 00:51:44,810
(bottle opens)

665
00:51:44,893 --> 00:51:45,769
How does it feel?

666
00:51:46,895 --> 00:51:47,729
Still the same?

667
00:51:48,730 --> 00:51:49,689
See any changes?

668
00:51:49,773 --> 00:51:51,024
What do you mean?

669
00:51:52,317 --> 00:51:53,235
(Jun exhales)

670
00:51:53,318 --> 00:51:54,236
The neighborhood.

671
00:51:55,737 --> 00:51:56,947
Has anything changed over here?

672
00:52:01,326 --> 00:52:04,037
It's only been a year.
It'd be strange if something did change.

673
00:52:09,084 --> 00:52:10,252
It's the same.

674
00:52:11,169 --> 00:52:12,587
It's just as good.

675
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:19,302
(happy music playing)

676
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:36,987
(male vocals singing)

677
00:52:38,697 --> 00:52:40,699
(song continues playing from radio)

678
00:52:53,295 --> 00:52:55,130
There's nothing to a camper.

679
00:52:55,213 --> 00:52:58,383
Keep all internal electronic controls off
while driving, or they'll malfunction.

680
00:52:58,466 --> 00:52:59,759
(song continues playing faintly)

681
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:01,678
How is the warranty coverage?

682
00:53:02,637 --> 00:53:04,764
The parts are covered for up to two years.

683
00:53:04,848 --> 00:53:07,976
But if you install additional equipment
and things break, you're not covered.

684
00:53:08,059 --> 00:53:11,104
So come by anytime
if you need something installed.

685
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:12,564
MAN 2: Okay.

686
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:15,775
Gosh, it looks really nice.

687
00:53:16,443 --> 00:53:18,236
We really worked hard on this.

688
00:53:18,486 --> 00:53:19,404
Huh?

689
00:53:20,238 --> 00:53:21,406
Where is this?

690
00:53:21,489 --> 00:53:23,700
This? This is Seosan.

691
00:53:23,867 --> 00:53:24,951
Is it far?

692
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:27,162
Well, it's about
a two-hour drive from Seoul.

693
00:53:28,246 --> 00:53:31,875
There's a long forest trail there,
and the ocean too.

694
00:53:31,958 --> 00:53:33,001
MINJAE: Mmm-hmm.

695
00:53:33,084 --> 00:53:34,377
This is my favorite place.

696
00:53:34,461 --> 00:53:35,420
MINJAE: Mmm.

697
00:53:35,503 --> 00:53:36,338
Take a look.

698
00:53:36,421 --> 00:53:38,465
MAN 2: Minjae, let's go.

699
00:53:38,548 --> 00:53:40,425
- MINJAE: Okay!
- Come here.

700
00:53:41,551 --> 00:53:43,303
Here. (laughs)

701
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:45,347
Oh, my.

702
00:53:45,972 --> 00:53:47,349
- All right. Let's get in.
- (giggles)

703
00:53:50,018 --> 00:53:51,853
MAN 2: There you go!

704
00:53:51,937 --> 00:53:52,938
(Kang inhales sharply)

705
00:53:53,021 --> 00:53:55,148
It's been a while since we visited Seoul.

706
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:56,900
Shall we grab some beer
and leave tomorrow?

707
00:53:57,525 --> 00:53:58,902
DONGJIN: I have plans tomorrow.

708
00:53:59,861 --> 00:54:02,405
KANG: Another camping trip?
It's supposed to rain all day tomorrow…

709
00:54:04,324 --> 00:54:06,576
You're going because of the rain.

710
00:54:07,285 --> 00:54:09,913
Gosh, aren't you tired
of going every week?

711
00:54:09,996 --> 00:54:11,289
Not at all.

712
00:54:11,373 --> 00:54:12,290
(Kang scoffs)

713
00:54:12,374 --> 00:54:14,084
You have my respect.

714
00:54:14,167 --> 00:54:15,835
(Dongjin chuckles)

715
00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:17,170
Let's grab lunch before we go.

716
00:54:19,631 --> 00:54:22,133
(sighs) That beer is so hard to come by.

717
00:54:23,635 --> 00:54:25,095
(slurping)

718
00:54:25,303 --> 00:54:27,764
(munching)

719
00:54:28,848 --> 00:54:31,101
(slurping)

720
00:54:32,018 --> 00:54:33,895
Did you secretly invest
in this restaurant or something?

721
00:54:34,771 --> 00:54:36,147
Hey, it tastes good.

722
00:54:36,231 --> 00:54:37,399
KANG: It is good. But…

723
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:40,652
It's not that great
to come every time we're in Seoul.

724
00:54:41,236 --> 00:54:43,280
There are so many
good restaurants around here.

725
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:45,824
(slurping)

726
00:54:46,992 --> 00:54:48,410
Then next time…

727
00:54:50,787 --> 00:54:52,038
Yes, what about next time?

728
00:54:52,622 --> 00:54:54,499
Try the udon. Their udon is pretty good.

729
00:54:56,626 --> 00:54:57,585
Oh.

730
00:54:57,669 --> 00:54:59,421
You're good with jokes now.

731
00:54:59,963 --> 00:55:01,256
You'll be performing dances next week.

732
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:03,383
(blows)

733
00:55:03,466 --> 00:55:04,926
(laughs)

734
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:06,136
You laugh a lot more too.

735
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:09,014
Hey, hurry up and eat.

736
00:55:10,682 --> 00:55:11,599
(slurping)

737
00:55:11,683 --> 00:55:12,809
WAITER: Welcome.

738
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:14,978
(door shuts, bell jingling)

739
00:55:15,061 --> 00:55:17,063
(footsteps approaching)

740
00:55:17,564 --> 00:55:19,566
(mellow music playing)

741
00:55:22,402 --> 00:55:23,653
(chopsticks clatter)

742
00:55:23,987 --> 00:55:25,989
(munching)

743
00:55:28,241 --> 00:55:29,868
(bell jingling)

744
00:55:30,493 --> 00:55:31,703
(inhales sharply)

745
00:55:31,786 --> 00:55:33,747
(phone vibrating)

746
00:55:34,789 --> 00:55:36,583
FATHER

747
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:38,376
Hello.

748
00:55:38,668 --> 00:55:40,045
DAEHONG: <i>Are you in Seoul?</i>

749
00:55:40,712 --> 00:55:42,422
Yes, we're about to head back.

750
00:55:43,006 --> 00:55:45,550
Do you need something? I can get it.

751
00:55:45,842 --> 00:55:47,302
DAEHONG: <i>What was that again?</i>

752
00:55:48,303 --> 00:55:53,266
Uh, that sweet snack you got me last time.

753
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:55,393
Oh, would you like that again?

754
00:55:55,477 --> 00:55:56,644
(Daehong laughs on phone)

755
00:55:56,728 --> 00:55:57,604
<i>Yes.</i>

756
00:55:58,021 --> 00:56:01,107
Okay. I'll get some on my way.
It'll be a couple of hours.

757
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:02,317
<i>Okay.</i>

758
00:56:02,901 --> 00:56:04,361
Drive safely.

759
00:56:05,111 --> 00:56:05,945
Okay.

760
00:56:07,113 --> 00:56:08,114
(hanging-up beep)

761
00:56:08,198 --> 00:56:10,533
(breathes deeply)

762
00:56:12,494 --> 00:56:14,537
(mellow music continues)

763
00:56:32,055 --> 00:56:32,931
JIGU: Hey.

764
00:56:33,932 --> 00:56:34,808
WOOJOO: Hmm.

765
00:56:39,270 --> 00:56:40,563
Good luck.

766
00:56:51,825 --> 00:56:53,451
(refrigerator door opens)

767
00:56:59,290 --> 00:57:01,292
(can opens)

768
00:57:02,836 --> 00:57:04,504
(typing)

769
00:57:04,587 --> 00:57:06,131
(Haesung sighs, gulps)

770
00:57:11,302 --> 00:57:13,304
(typing continues)

771
00:57:15,306 --> 00:57:16,307
(sighs)

772
00:57:18,643 --> 00:57:20,270
I heard you came by the pharmacy.

773
00:57:22,147 --> 00:57:23,189
(clicks tongue)

774
00:57:23,273 --> 00:57:25,442
I had work nearby and stopped by.

775
00:57:26,901 --> 00:57:28,069
Sim Woojoo.

776
00:57:29,529 --> 00:57:30,738
What?

777
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:37,036
Mom told Mr. Han Dongjin
she'd send him food whenever he wants,

778
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:40,123
and told him to reach her anytime.
Did you know?

779
00:57:46,212 --> 00:57:47,714
She must not have told you.

780
00:57:51,509 --> 00:57:53,511
(gulping)

781
00:57:54,971 --> 00:57:56,097
(sighs)

782
00:57:57,515 --> 00:58:00,727
If that's how Mom feels, who's to say no?

783
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:07,066
That's my conclusion.

784
00:58:10,111 --> 00:58:11,321
There's nothing…

785
00:58:13,072 --> 00:58:15,283
that prohibits you two
from being together anymore.

786
00:58:23,041 --> 00:58:25,043
(bright music playing)

787
00:58:34,719 --> 00:58:36,054

796
00:59:35,697 --> 00:59:36,698

JIGU: <i>Maybe he'll come and maybe he won't.
It's fifty-fifty.</i>

804
01:00:55,818 --> 01:00:58,112
<i>You should still come at least, Woojoo.</i>

805
01:01:01,658 --> 01:01:03,910
(music tops off with crescendo)

806
01:01:06,037 --> 01:01:08,039

01:03:07,617 --> 01:03:10,787
This is my first street performance,
so I'm really nervous.
