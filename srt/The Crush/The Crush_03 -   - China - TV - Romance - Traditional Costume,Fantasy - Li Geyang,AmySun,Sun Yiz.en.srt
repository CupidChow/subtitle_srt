=Episode 3=
(A Couple's Battle Against Tea Farmers)

14
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,560
Beyond these bamboos

15
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,800
lies the tea mountain.

16
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,200
Let me ask you.

17
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,680
Be honest with me.

18
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,400
Do you have a crush?

19
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,280
This is absurd.

20
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,400
Think about it.

21
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,960
If a woman stays by your side

22
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,360
and you remain calm,

23
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,000
doesn't that mean

24
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,840
you have a crush?

25
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,280
This looks like the year
of my coming-of-age ceremony.

26
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,880
I went alone to pick tea leaves

27
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:41,760
when big rain struck,

28
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,480
and I fell off a cliff.

29
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,200
One person in white
with tied-up hair saved me.

30
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,280
I only remember that one

31
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,800
was carrying a handkerchief
with crabapple flowers.

32
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,680
So you're saying

33
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,040
you don't even know

34
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,080
that person's gender?

35
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:05,360
Right.

36
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,080
(He)

37
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,160
(didn't even see the face clearly)

38
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,800
(but still pines for her?)

39
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,160
She showed me kindness.

40
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,360
In this lifetime,

41
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,000
I'll never forget her favor.

42
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,800
Let me remind you.

43
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,080
Gratitude and love
are totally different.

44
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,120
The tea plantation is there, right?

45
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,640
If the tea grade drops by one tier,

46
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:39,160
the price difference becomes 30 percent.

47
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,120
If we mix high and low grades
to sell to the Li family,

48
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,400
we'll make at least double the profit.

49
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,800
He won't notice our scheme, will he?

50
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,120
Li Zixuan just became the head.

51
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,600
This is his first time here.

52
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,560
He won't confront us.

53
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:53,720
In this world,

54
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,960
the bold feast while the timid starve.

55
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,120
If we don't take advantage now

56
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,920
and wait until he becomes shrewd,

57
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,080
we'll miss our chance.

58
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:02,920
Well said!

59
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:03,760
They're here.

60
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,320
Let's go.

61
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,120
Let's go.

62
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,080
Mr. Li, you've arrived.

63
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,280
The sample tea leaves are prepared.

64
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,200
I'll inspect them.

65
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,760
Of course. Please inspect.

66
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,520
Mr. Li,

67
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,680
these tea leaves

68
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,880
were all picked before sunrise.

69
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,080
Same as always,

70
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,040
we reserve the finest tea leaves

71
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:32,960
for your family.

72
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,440
These are

73
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,160
the top-grade pre-Qingming buds.

74
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,400
For generations,
we've supplied tea to you

75
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,680
without negligence.

76
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,280
How are they?

77
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,440
The sample tea seems fine.

78
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,360
After full weighing,
come collect payment.

79
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,760
Could you please

80
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,920
deliver the tea to our manor?

81
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,000
So the arrangement remains as before?

82
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:00,920
Yes.

83
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,160
Not appropriate.

84
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,760
Now that we've only seen the samples,

85
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,320
we'll pay a deposit first.

86
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,720
After all tea is delivered to the manor,

87
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,760
we'll naturally pay in full.

88
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,440
This isn't right.

89
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,680
By the old rules,

90
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,800
payment was made
immediately after sampling.

91
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,520
Exactly.

92
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,760
We did so before.

93
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,840
Now, it's different.

94
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,120
You look unfamiliar, young sir.

95
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,400
Might I ask your relation to the Mr. Li?

96
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,280
It doesn't matter.

97
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,720
What's important is

98
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,880
whether the tea leaves
beyond these samples

99
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,000
have any issues.

100
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,000
Mr. Li,

101
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,760
we've supplied tea
to your family for generations.

102
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,360
Between us,

103
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,720
trust is paramount.

104
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,640
Everyone, look.

105
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,200
All the tea is right here
in the courtyard.

106
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,360
If there's any problem,

107
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,080
we'll know upon inspection.

108
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,560
And if no issues are found?

109
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,960
If there's no problem,

110
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,520
we will pay double.

111
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,520
Deal.

112
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:01,520
Begin.

113
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,400
Let's start.

114
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:55,880
Mr. Li,

115
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,160
is there an issue with this tea?

116
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,680
The leaves look natural

117
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,640
and feel tender.

118
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:05,880
Good tea.

119
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:11,400
Does your earlier promise still stand?

120
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,480
Continue.

121
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:17,640
Sir,

122
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,200
you don't intend to inspect

123
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,520
all the tea leaves, do you?

124
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,760
Be patient.

125
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,360
Three's the limit.

126
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,120
We'll check two more baskets.

127
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,000
Could he have discovered?

128
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:34,680
Let me do it.

129
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,240
Look at his fair, delicate appearance.

130
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,080
He clearly never worked
on a tea mountain.

131
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,000
Good or bad tea.

132
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,560
He probably can't tell the difference.

133
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,640
If he distinguished them,

134
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,720
our decades of tea farming
would be a joke.

135
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,120
It's obvious.

136
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,680
Even if we placed
inferior tea before him,

137
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,880
he likely couldn't identify it.

138
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,560
Ever since Master Li passed,

139
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,800
their family has been falling.

140
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,200
Rich families breed
nothing but wastrels.

141
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,320
No wonder their tea business

142
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,200
keeps worsening.

143
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,480
Zixuan.

144
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,680
Let's inspect this basket.

145
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,280
Yes.

146
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:39,760
Well...

147
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,440
(They're still providing inferior tea).

148
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,960
(My father showed
mercy out of old ties,)

149
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,680
(but it's different now.)

150
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,800
Tea buds that grow

151
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,840
among clustered leaves

152
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,120
in groups of three, four or five.

153
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,960
Only the most prominent shoots
get picked.

154
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,200
The top-grade tea leaves

155
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,400
should be tender

156
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,480
like the sample we saw earlier.

157
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,800
But this leaf lacks
both form and essence.

158
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,480
Clearly the lower-grade one.

159
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,840
It's inferior tea.

160
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,800
Well played.

161
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,560
Using premium tea prices to sell
mixed inferior tea leaves.

162
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,680
Trying to cheat our family.

163
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:38,160
This trick ends now and forever.

164
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,080
Mr. Li,

165
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,480
we have traded for generations.

166
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,920
This outsider

167
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:48,560
is interfering,

168
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,240
sowing discord.

169
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,720
We demand an explanation.

170
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,520
Who is he?

171
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,600
What authority does he
have to boss us around?

172
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,480
Alright.

173
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,840
Since you demand to know my identity,

174
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,320
I'll tell you.

175
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,120
I am the Madam of the Li family,

176
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,240
Wei Xiaotang.

177
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,840
She's a woman.

178
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,160
Mr. Li,

179
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,680
your family has an ancestral rule.

180
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,200
Women can't engage in business.

181
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,760
Rules are made by people,

182
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,280
and people can change them.

183
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,240
Today I'm here

184
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,480
to reform the family rules.

185
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,240
Women should stay at home,
being obedient.

186
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,400
You want to alter traditions?

187
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,120
Why should we heed a woman's words?

188
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:28,760
Alright.

189
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,880
You don't have to.

190
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,600
But after we spread word

191
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,600
of this inferior tea scam today,

192
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,800
see which tea merchant

193
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,160
in Haiqing Town will buy from you again.

194
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:42,680
I heard Mr. Li married the daughter

195
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,960
of Lord Taozhu in Haiqing Town.

196
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:45,840
Well...

197
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,240
Mr. Li,

198
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,896
there was a sorting error.

199
00:10:00,896 --> 00:10:02,304
I'll immediately separate

200
00:10:02,304 --> 00:10:03,168
these leaves by grade

201
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,360
and deliver them.

202
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:06,760
Good.

203
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,240
We only accept top-grade tea.

204
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,800
Thank you.

205
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,360
You should've complied earlier.

206
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,280
Sort the mixed leaves yourselves.

207
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,680
We'll be waiting.

208
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,120
How did you detect the problem

209
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,120
in those tea baskets?

210
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,720
That bamboo basket

211
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,960
readily absorbs moisture.

212
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,240
And its color changes

213
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,240
with the humidity.

214
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,600
I didn't expect you
to be so resourceful.

215
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,680
Even if I didn't spell it out,

216
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,800
you had sensed it, right?

217
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,760
They have been supplying

218
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,640
tea to us for generations.

219
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,560
Those traditions
were established by my forefathers.

220
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,920
If you play the gentleman with them,

221
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,360
they'll respond with trickery.

222
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,960
If those two were truly honest men,

223
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,200
we'd treat them fairly without question.

224
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,960
But those tea farmers

225
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,440
are

226
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,640
so deceitful.

227
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:09,760
Haven't you heard

228
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,960
of fighting fire with fire?

229
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,480
Dishonest people like them

230
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,800
see kindness

231
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,080
as a weakness.

232
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,480
Listen up.

233
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:18,560
Li Zixuan,

234
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,960
in business, without firm methods,

235
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,560
there's no room for mercy.

236
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,720
Mr. Li.

237
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:27,600
Mr. Li.

238
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:31,840
Mr. Li.

239
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,080
I finally caught up with you.

240
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,080
Our plantation has been
infested with pests.

241
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,640
Could you please come take a look?
