(Another World's Mother-in-Law War)

14
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,080
(In the Li Manor,)

15
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:05,760
(scheming lurks everywhere.)

16
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,560
(Being submissive and compromising)

17
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,560
(will only invite endless abuse.)

18
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,040
(Only by taking)

19
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,120
(the initiative can I survive)

20
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,880
(and return to my original world.)

21
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:22,176
(Li Zixuan, Li family's eldest son)

22
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,384
(Wei Xiaotang, Wei family's daughter)

23
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:34,560
Wei Xiaotang used to be
a daughter in the Wei family,

24
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,880
(Second concubine of Li family)
but here, she is a daughter-in-law.

25
00:01:38,208 --> 00:01:39,560
(Maternal uncle)

26
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,160
Tomorrow, I'll teach her

27
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,840
the proper conduct of a bride.

28
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,560
(Li Manor)

29
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,960
I brought my bride to serve you tea.

30
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,080
The bride shall serve tea
to her mother-in-law.

31
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,880
Why look at him? Serve tea.

32
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:57,320
Here.

33
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:58,320
Do it.

34
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,600
When a bride serves tea,

35
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,920
she must kneel.

36
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,800
Our family does have this tradition.

37
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,400
Madam, please kneel.

38
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,320
What?

39
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,360
Are you implying

40
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,120
I'm not worthy
of your kneeling as your mother-in-law?

41
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,520
Your family begged to marry me.

42
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,120
You think you can bully me now?

43
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:41,360
You...

44
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,200
What?

45
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,080
I've seen countless like you.

46
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,960
A malicious mother-in-law

47
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,160
who only knows how to nitpick.

48
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:52,080
First complaining
the tea is cold, and then it is hot.

49
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,400
You won't enforce your rules on me!

50
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:55,600
This...

51
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,200
You...

52
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,200
Our family has lost all decorum!

53
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,000
Even a newlywed bride

54
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,600
disrespects her mother-in-law

55
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,560
like this?

56
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:09,080
Speaking to me so affectionately,

57
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,600
while being a backstabber.

58
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,840
Should I expose all your schemes?

59
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,000
Last night, uncle...

60
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,120
What's wrong?

61
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,520
Zixuan, this wedding wine
was gifted by your mother.

62
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,160
May you two be united as one,

63
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,560
bound in mutual trust and affection.

64
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,600
But was this truly wedding wine

65
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,240
or poisoned wine?

66
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,040
You know the truth.

67
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:38,920
You...

68
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:39,920
What?

69
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:40,720
You...

70
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,960
You're a madwoman!

71
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,320
How insolent!

72
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,120
Losing composure already?

73
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,280
We're just getting started.

74
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,240
I haven't even mentioned

75
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,000
all your dirty deeds yet.

76
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,880
Li Zixuan lost his biological
mother when he was little.

77
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,000
You cared for him,

78
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,440
but starved and deprived him constantly.

79
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,760
If he had not been resilient,

80
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,120
he wouldn't have survived.

81
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,640
Wei Xiaotang! You lunatic!

82
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,880
These are all lies!

83
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,720
Lies?

84
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:13,640
Your

85
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,400
malicious intent

86
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,160
has been so obvious.

87
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,680
You're the epitome of a poisonous widow.

88
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:24,240
Guards! Restrain this madwoman!

89
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,960
You think feigning madness

90
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:33,400
and slandering me will save you?

91
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,160
I tolerated your disrespect,

92
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,480
but as our family's bride,

93
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,960
you lack chastity.

94
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,920
You've shamed our family.

95
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,280
This cannot go unpunished.

96
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,240
Mother, what do you mean?

97
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,040
After you spent last night,

98
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,920
why was the handkerchief on the bed

99
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,200
stainless?

100
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,280
You're clearly unchaste!

101
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,920
Xuan,

102
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,640
I've failed

103
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,040
in my duties,

104
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,520
letting you marry

105
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,240
this shameless woman!

106
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,800
Allowing this tainted woman
to marry into our family

107
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,400
has utterly ruined

108
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,920
our family's reputation!

109
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,960
You defiled our household

110
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,480
and slandered me.

111
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,200
Unchaste and unfilial!

112
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,280
By law,

113
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:33,080
we can burn you at the stake!

114
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:36,640
I...

115
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,200
What are you doing?

116
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,320
It is so hilarious.

117
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:49,000
Burning a living person alive

118
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,640
because of missing virgin blood?

119
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,760
What kind of nonsense is this?

120
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,440
Now, I am the matriarch
of the Li family.

121
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,080
I decide all matters within the family.

122
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,160
You're just a woman here.

123
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,520
Even if Master Li
were still alive today,

124
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,240
after such a scandal occurred,

125
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,600
he wouldn't protect you.

126
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:10,600
Let go.

127
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,160
That wasn't her fault.

128
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,400
I was drunk last night

129
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,600
and failed in my duties.

130
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,400
What?

131
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,520
We've gone through formal wedding rites,

132
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,240
but this is merely a fake marriage.

133
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,720
We need to only play our roles

134
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,080
as husband and wife

135
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,800
in public.

136
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:38,040
Don't let the Li family find out.

137
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,720
Do you understand?

138
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,320
(Lin Yuhao, CEO of a gaming company)
(I was the CEO of a gaming company.)

139
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,040
(An accident transported
me into my own game.)

140
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,560
(It begins on my wedding night)

141
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,760
(when my husband was poisoned to death.)

142
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,720
(I stole the antidote)

143
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,320
(from an NPC in the game.)

144
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:10,480
(To escape this world, I must complete)

145
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,680
(the Top Tea mission.)

146
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,520
(I need an ally.)

147
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:19,400
(Li Zixuan, it has to be you.)

148
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,800
Starting today,

149
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:28,400
I'll help you secure
the position as head of Li family,

150
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:32,120
and you'll help me
earn the Top Tea title.

151
00:07:34,368 --> 00:07:42,944
(Game Mission)
