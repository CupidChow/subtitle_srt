15
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,680
It's all because of

16
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:14,520
your absurd rules forbidding
women from doing business.

17
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:15,880
I had no choice.

18
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,880
It looks quite dashing on you.

19
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,720
Tell me.

20
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,360
What should I do next?

21
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,360
What should you do?

22
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,640
Just assist Li Zixuan

00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,840
in earning the title of Top Tea

24
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,000
and get closer with him.

25
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:32,960
Then you can return.

26
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:34,880
Get closer?

27
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:36,640
Wait.

28
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,920
You mean we need to sleep together?

29
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,080
Hurry up and do it.

30
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,240
Sleep together!

31
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,760
I'll find a way to do it.

32
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:50,920

33
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:51,760

No.

36
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,360
He went with some tea farmer

37
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,720
to check tea at Fairy Cliff.

38
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,240
Fairy Cliff?

39
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,360
There are no tea mountains there.

40
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,240
No tea mountains there?

41
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:06,800
That's right.

42
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:15,720
Madam.

43
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,320
Your tea plantation is at Fairy Cliff?

44
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,760
Yes, Mr. Li.

45
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:25,800
Right ahead.

46
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,520
This way.

47
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,240
This doesn't look like a tea plantation.

48
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,520
Of course there is
no tea plantation here.

49
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,280
Mr. Li.

50
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:42,760
Sorry.

51
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,720

If you die,

87
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,400
how can I create the Top Tea?

88
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,200
How did you realize

89
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,880
that tea farmer was fishy?

one's fingers chapped

So I knew

00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,320
he wasn't a tea farmer.

99
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,000
Then why go with him

100
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,560
if you saw through his act?

101
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,360
Your employer sent you to kill me

102
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,880

00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,320
and follow the trail

00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,440
straight to the mastermind.

107
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,800
Take a guess.

108
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,280
Will your employer

109
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,440
use you as a scapegoat?

110
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,720
How much is your employer paying you?

111
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,280
I'll double it.

112
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,960
Just return and tell him

113
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,400
that I'm dead.

114
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,880
Then you'll get payment thrice.

115
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,120
Enough to live comfortably.

116
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:32,560
Isn't it?

117
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,240
Why should I trust you?

118
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:43,600
Enough?

119
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:53,000
Tell me, who is your employer?

120
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,520
I initially planned
to lay low for a while

121
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,200
and confront Mr. Wang

122
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,800
when he came to collect tea.

123
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,960
But even if you testify against him,

124
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,360
he might still deny everything.

125
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,840
At best, we'd gain

126
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,120
minor leverage in business.

127
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,520
But since you've already set the trap,

128
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,680
let's expand the scheme further.

129
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,080
How should we do it?

130
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,280
Now, we have internal traitors
and outside enemies.

131
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:27,120
We can't distinguish friends from foes.

132
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,040
Chaos in the Li family

133
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,400
will show everyone's true colors.

134
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,600
Then we'll lure the traitors out

135
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,320
and capture them in one sweep.

136
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,680
Why would a young woman like you

137
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,720
develop such cunning strategies?

138
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,840
Did your past life involve

139
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,560
constant scheming?

140
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,720
True sincerity between people

141
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,800
is the rarest treasure.

142
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:59,360
Everything in this world
is a transaction.

143
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,400
That's an eternal truth.

144
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,760
Does this

145
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,720
apply to us too?

00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:46,600
I'm hungry.

192
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,240
Hungry?

193
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,040
Easy to fix.

194
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:54,720
Here.

195
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,000
I'm hungry too.

196
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,600
Should we eat the offerings?

197
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,200
Why not?

198
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,800
They're meant for you. Try it.

199
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,160
Sweet?

200
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,720
You heard
the second concubine's words today?

201
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,960
People

202
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,440
reveal their true nature

203
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:24,240
only when you're in crisis.

204
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:27,760
Your foolish brother
will inherit everything.

205
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,480
After all these years in this household,

206
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:34,520
I know what she is thinking best.

207
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,480
Not just second concubine.

208
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,360
This is just the beginning.

209
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,680
Tomorrow,

210
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,160
you can know it.

211
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,120
The real show will unfold.

212
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,560
Big show.

213
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,920
I'm thirsty.

214
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,920
You're a corpse

215
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,680
with too many demands.

216
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,360
Be grateful that you get offerings.

217
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,600
I knelt and wailed all day.

218
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:05,984
So exhausted!

219
00:13:05,984 --> 00:13:06,784
No food or drink.

220
00:13:06,784 --> 00:13:07,840
I don't complain,

221
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,000
and now you complain?

222
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:10,440
I...

223
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,880
I don't like apples.

224
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:15,520
Get up.

225
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,200
Scoot over that way.

226
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,520
Let me lie inside for a bit.

227
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,320
Ah?

228
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,080
What?

229
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,640
I've been kneeling all day.

230
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,720
I'm exhausted.

231
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,480
Enough eating that apple?

232
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,560
I'll put it back.

233
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,600
Lie down, so I can get in.

234
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,384
Move to the edge.

235
00:13:36,384 --> 00:13:37,560
Or how else can I get in?

236
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,360
Sit down. Lie back.

237
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:45,920
Scoot over a bit more.

238
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,296
Right, a little further.

239
00:13:47,296 --> 00:13:47,680
Okay?

240
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:48,920
Fine. Just stay like this.

241
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,280
Right now, I really want someone

242
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:56,400
to give me a full-body massage.

243
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:57,800
My face...

244
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:00,560
Okay.

245
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,400
Close the lid. The light is blinding me.

246
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,840
Did you get a too small coffin?

247
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,600
This coffin is meant for one person.

248
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,560
Turn sideways so I can lie down.

249
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,280
Have you ever seen
a corpse lie sideways?

250
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,240
Corpses don't eat apples.

251
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,640
Move over there.

252
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,656
Just a little.

253
00:14:22,656 --> 00:14:23,680
I can't move any further.

254
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,240
Stop squeezing.

255
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,680
You're pulling my hair.

256
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:31,720
Stop tossing around.

257
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,920
You'll attract people.

258
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,800
What if someone does come?

259
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,800
We'll drag them in here
to sleep with us.

260
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,640
Outrageous.

261
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:43,240
What did you mean by "massage"?

262
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,720
Just a massage.

263
00:14:45,152 --> 00:14:45,680
(Li Manor)

264
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,960
Mother, I'm telling the truth.

265
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,760
I saw my brother and his wife eating.

266
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:49,960
Enough with your nonsense!

267
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,600
Then he even took her into the coffin!

268
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,280
What?

269
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,520
Someone! Open that coffin!

270
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,480
Who's this?

271
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:11,080
(Oh no, I overslept.)

272
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,120
What are you doing, Wei Xiaotang?

273
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,720
A hundred years' karma
brings two together.

274
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,160
This...

275
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:28,960
Honey,

276
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:33,472
let me follow you in death!

277
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,760
You! Get her out of there!

278
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:38,960
Mother!

279
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:39,920
Mother!

280
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,800
The tea merchants are here

281
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,440
demanding the tea they ordered.

282
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,416
Go look immediately!
