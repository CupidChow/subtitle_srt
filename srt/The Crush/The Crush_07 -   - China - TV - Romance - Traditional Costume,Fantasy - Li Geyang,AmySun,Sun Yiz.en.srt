(Grudge and Arson)

14
00:01:04,288 --> 00:01:08,142
(Wang's Tea Estate's Warehouse)

15
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,080
There's so much tea here.

16
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,200
How would I know
which one is the tribute tea?

17
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,400
Let's just burn them all!

18
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,000
Why are you here?

19
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,120
What are you doing?

20
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,200
I want to use their own methods

21
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,280
against them.

22
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,920
Burn them all down!

23
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,760
Mr. Wang is despicable,

24
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,560
but we'll find our own way
to revenge him.

25
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,080
Even if you burn this place down,

26
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,880
our tribute tea won't get any better.

27
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,880
You can tolerate this, but I can't!

28
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,080
Don't forget

29
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,240
your mother kept compromising
and tolerating back then,

30
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,280
so got bullied to death
by your stepmother.

31
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,760
Want to end up like her?

32
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,680
Sorry, I didn't mean it.

33
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:13,960
Don't take it to heart.

00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,120
(Yuanfeng Sixth Year,)

35
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,080
(Mr. Wang secretly damaged
the Li's tribute tea with drugs.)

37
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,040
(committed arson)

38
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,240
(with Zixuan to destroy
Wang's tea warehouse to revenge him.)

39
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:30,360
(The flames also
ignited Zixuan's resolve.)

40
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,080
Young Master.

41
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,000
Young Master.

42
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I heard last night,

43
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,320
the Wang's Tea Estate's
warehouse caught fire.

44
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,640
Really?

45
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:47,680
Really.

46
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,240
Really?

47
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,600
Really, Young Master.

48
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:56,120
That must've caused huge losses!

49
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,720
I was about to celebrate,

50
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,080
but then heard

51
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,320
Mr. Wang had shipped
the tribute tea away.

52
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,960
Can you believe it?

53
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,000
He's really lucky then.

54
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,080
Forget it. Let's focus on

55
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,400
finding a way to restore the tea.

56
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:23,880
I thought of someone.

57
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:26,760
Who is it?

58
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,680
But

59
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,800
you need to use your charms.

60
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,120
You can't do that.

61
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,120
It has to be you.

62
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,560
That eager to go?

63
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,880
No, not really.

64
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,280
Do you know where we're going?

65
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,280
Want to come?

66
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:07,920
Where?

67
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,160
(Tianxiang Tea House)
Miss Niaoniao.

68
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,240
We want you

69
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,120
to teach us the technique

70
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,200
of tea washing.

71
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,480
Please,

72
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,760
share your expertise.

73
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,240
Young Master.

74
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:21,960
Or,

75
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,440
I should address you as Madam Li.

76
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,200
I have a favor to ask.

77
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,960
I wish to speak with Mr. Li privately.

78
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,360
May I?

79
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,760
Okay.

80
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,280
It is improper.

81
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,720
Our priority.

82
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,600
Have a good chat.

83
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,160
I'll go out. Have a good chat.

84
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,320
I'll wait outside.

85
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,280
Mr. Li, please.

86
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,840
Go! Hurry!

87
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,560
You got this.

88
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,720
Miss Niaoniao, just say what you want.

89
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,920
Share your expertise,

90
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,840
and we'll offer you a generous reward.

91
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,760
Mr. Li.

92
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,760
Let me explain about last time.

93
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,720
The tea house

94
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,640
asked us to use aphrodisiac incense

95
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,800
with floral tea,

96
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,160
and I had to do so.

97
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:45,760
I have to apologize to you.

98
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:53,200
Actually, I've long admired you.

99
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,880
When we met that day,

100
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,320
I was genuinely captivated by you.

101
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,560
I love you at first sight.

102
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,840
So, about
the aphrodisiac incense that day...

103
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,080
I did have ulterior motives.

104
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,720
Driven by affection,

105
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:12,680
I wanted a fleeting romance with you.

106
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,600
Miss Niaoniao.

107
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,160
I am a married man.

108
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,800
Please maintain respect.

109
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,880
I know I am not noble enough

110
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,720
to deserve you.

111
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,240
But I never fear to love someone.

112
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,640
I can teach you the unique technique

113
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,760
to wash the tea leaves.

114
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,800
But I have a condition.

115
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:37,920
What is it?

116
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:41,960
You claimed to be a married man,

117
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,080
so you had to reject me.

118
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,640
My condition is simple.

119
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,720
You divorce your wife.

120
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,560
I refuse.

121
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,160
Don't!

122
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,160
Don't!

123
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,040
I agree.

124
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,400
I agree.

125
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:02,760
Miss Niaoniao.

126
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,920
If you teach Zixuan the technique,

127
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,360
we'll divorce now.

128
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,160
Absurd!

129
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,920
The competition is tomorrow!

130
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,360
What's there to hesitate now?

131
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,040
Just get a divorce.

132
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:21,600
Divorce.

133
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,920
Wei Xiaotang,
what are you talking about?

134
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:25,960
You are

135
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:26,920
my legitimate wife.

136
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,720
You divorce me that easily?

137
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,040
In that case,

138
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,040
I won't participate in

139
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,640
the tea competition.

140
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,760
Our tea leaves are ruined.

141
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
As long as

142
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,800
it doesn't involve
killing or harming anyone,

143
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,640
why can't you agree?

144
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:44,760
Ridiculous!

145
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:46,880
Miss Niaoniao.

146
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,760
We'll divorce.

147
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,560
Li Zixuan! Li Zixuan!

148
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,760
Why are you being so stubborn?

149
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,000
Don't stick to trifles.

150
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,960
This is no trifle.

151
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,960
You're being ridiculous!

152
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:06,920
Fine.

153
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,320
I'm being ridiculous!

154
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,680
I'm shameless.

155
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,560
But let's talk about business.

156
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,080
Now you identified the problem,

157
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,520
then you must solve it.

158
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,560
Moreover,

159
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,280
between you and me,

160
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,160
it's at most a business marriage.

161
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,000
Why are you acting
like we're deeply in love?

162
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,360
Besides,

163
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,680
when I helped you eliminate your uncle

164
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,160
and dealt with tea merchants,

165
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,760
why didn't you say
I was being ridiculous?

166
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,160
My goal is to obtain the Top Tea.

167
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,160
If I can't,

168
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,120
then I can't go back!

169
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,560
Then stay with me

170
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,960
until we get the Top Tea.

171
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,840
Maybe

172
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,560
let's go back to Miss Niaoniao.

173
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,400
Go home.

174
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,720
If you don't agree,

175
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,640
I won't go home.

176
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,320
Up to you.

177
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:14,960
I won't stay here.

178
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:18,320
Li...

179
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,520
Is he some spoony?

180
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:25,800
Li Zixuan!
