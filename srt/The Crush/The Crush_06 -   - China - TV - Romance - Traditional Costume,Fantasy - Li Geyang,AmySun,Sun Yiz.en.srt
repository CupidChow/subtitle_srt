(Coquette and Slap)

14
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:03,360
Do you like it, Young Master?

15
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,120
This tea is light and elegant.

16
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,800
The floral and tea aromas
blend perfectly,

17
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,800
complementing each other.

18
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,560
Miss Niaoniao.

19
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,760
How did you achieve this?

20
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,600
I have my own technique
of washing the tea leaves.

21
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,920
It preserves the tea's flavor,

22
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,000
nor letting it become too intense,

23
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,600
overpowering the floral fragrance.

24
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,560
How premium!

25
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,440
Miss.

26
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,240
Maybe you should give me one.

27
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,120
My apologies.

28
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,080
I was so engrossed in discussing

29
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,000
with this Young Master.

30
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,040
Forgive me.

31
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,200
Here, please.

32
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,120
It's truly coquettish.

33
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,680
Young Master, what do you think?

34
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,400
This tea doesn't seem like a floral tea,

35
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,120
but green tea.

36
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,240
I mean,

37
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,560
you are as your tea suggests,

38
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,800
so coquettish.

39
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,120
Good.

40
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,480
I shall prepare the second cup

41
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,560
for you both.

42
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,520
Please allow me

43
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:55,960
to serve you
this second cup of tea myself.

44
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,880
I'll drink this cup of tea

45
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,160
for him.

46
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,120
Is it necessary to serve him like that?

47
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,080
What's next?

48
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,680
Taking off clothes?

49
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,400
Tianxiang Tea House?

50
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,000
But it's like a brothel.

51
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,040
Young Master.

52
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,200
Don't you satisfy with me?

53
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,360
If you do,

54
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,880
take it out on me.

55
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:22,720
Don't

56
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:23,760
slander

57
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,880
the tea house.

58
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:28,960
Alright.

59
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,120
Tell me,

60
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,800
how should I take it out on you?

61
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,640
If slapping me in the face

62
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,640
would ease your anger,

63
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:44,040
I am willing to.

64
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:48,880
You!

65
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,320
Xiaotang.

66
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,760
She told me to.

67
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,160
Didn't you hear that?

68
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:55,360
I just granted her wish.

69
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,600
She told me to,

70
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,640
and I had to.

71
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,640
Mr. Li.

72
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,600
Don't blame her.

73
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:03,840
But

74
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,680
that slap made me a bit lightheaded.

75
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,920
You called me Mr. Li.

76
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,480
I never mentioned my surname.

77
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,840
How do you know this?

78
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,960
You are

79
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,320
excellent in making tea.

80
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,520
But the tricks Tianxiang Tea House does

81
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,880
are despicable.

82
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,520
Using aphrodisiac incense
with floral tea

83
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,720
to create arousing effects,

84
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,640
making every guest

85
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,000
linger as if intoxicated.

86
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,200
Using such a vile way

87
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,320
to gain huge profits,

88
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:42,680
you are

89
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,680
really contemptible.

90
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,560
Mother.

91
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,880
I feel so bored lately.

92
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,800
There's emptiness in my heart.

93
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,120
The eldest manages the household,

94
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,480
and the family works as one.

95
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,880
Naturally, you feel bored.

96
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,000
Mother.

97
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:22,680
I think

98
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,600
Zixuan manages
the tea estate quite well,

99
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,240
and the workers are diligent.

100
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,600
Zixuan told me

101
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,240
not to worry.

102
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,040
With the Mingqian tea,

103
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,480
we'll surely win
the tea estate competition!

104
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,760
He handles all tea estate matters.

105
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,240
There's nothing

106
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,760
for you to worry.

107
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,080
Mother,

108
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,480
why are you scolding me again?

109
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,520
Your tea-making technique,

110
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,720
how is it going?

111
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,160
It is too easy for me.

112
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,320
Zixuan taught me everything

113
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,520
and shared all his knowledge.

114
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,920
He said I'm exceptionally talented,

115
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,080
a quick learner.

116
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,120
You have to do something

117
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,480
to secure
the Li family business yourself.

118
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,160
Look at you!

119
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,720
Pretending to be sick again?

120
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,560
Mother.

121
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,320
My stomach hurts.

122
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,400
Zimo!

123
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,560
Your stomach hurts?

124
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,200
But you were fine moments ago!

125
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,680
Why does your stomach hurt now?

126
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:33,880
What happened?

127
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,440
Mother.

128
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,520
Mother.

129
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,520
Zimo, are you okay?

130
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,400
Help!

131
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,920
Zimo ate exactly what I did today.

132
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,760
But he drank cups

133
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,240
of Mingqian tea.

134
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:03,760
Well...

135
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,400
What is this?

136
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,360
It's grayish-yellow,

137
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,120
with pungent aroma.

138
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,440
It's Chuanwu powder.

139
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,800
Chuanwu powder?

140
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,560
Anyone who eats it

141
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,640
suffers abdominal pain

142
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,560
and paralysis.

143
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,320
These symptoms match Zimo's.

144
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,000
Are you saying

145
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,200
our tea

146
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:30,640
has been drugged?

147
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,240
Another trick?

148
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,480
They targeted you before,

149
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,320
and now they're targeting the tea.

150
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,760
Who are you talking about?

151
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,360
Why not report him to the authorities?

152
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,040
We have no evidence.

153
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,120
Reporting would be futile.

154
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:49,960
Then...

155
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,160
Don't you avenge Zimo?

156
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,840
Since they've made the move,

157
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:59,040
then we should return the favor.

158
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:01,480
How about

159
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,200
we invite him

160
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,520
for tea tomorrow?

161
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,840
Mr. Wang, we invited you today

162
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,240
to taste

163
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,040
the new tribute tea.

164
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,160
Mr. Wang, please.

165
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,080
New tribute tea?

166
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,080
Let me taste.

167
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,320
Actually,

168
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,560
it's been stored
in the warehouse for a while.

169
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,360
Oh?

170
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,120
This is the tribute tea.

171
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,400
It might be improper for me to drink.

172
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,640
It's meant

173
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,800
for palace nobles.

174
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,560
Mr. Wang.

175
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,840
You're noble in our eyes.

176
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,720
- You flatter me.
- Mr. Wang.

177
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,160
I've long heard
of your ties with the Lis.

178
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,760
Please forgive me

179
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,880
for what I did before.

180
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,680
Don't mind it.

181
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,600
I've already forgiven you.

182
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,040
Well then,

183
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,880
please

184
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,200
accept this tea

185
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,280
I offer.

186
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,920
Don't you want to drink?

187
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,360
Or are you worried

188
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,840
that we drugged the tea?

189
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:19,080
Xiaotang! Mind your manners.

190
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,600
Forgive her, Mr. Wang.

191
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,120
She's just kidding.

192
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,840
I'm not kidding.

193
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,880
I think Mr. Wang

194
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,320
knows our tribute tea

195
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,680
has been drugged,

196
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,160
so he refuses to drink it.

197
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,200
Xiaotang, enough!

198
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,440
What?

199
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,120
I offer tea to him,

200
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,400
yet he refuses to drink.

201
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,080
Doesn't that suggest something?

202
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,040
Mr. Wang is an honest man.

203
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,240
He has nothing to hide.

204
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,280
But look, he dares not drink.

205
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,280
Why would he dare not?

206
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,152
He just dares not.

207
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:54,760
He would definitely drink it.

208
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,120
Then drink it.

209
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,280
Please.

210
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,840
Alright, stop it.

211
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,520
When I was building my business,

212
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:10,240
you two were still babies.

213
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,040
You didn't invite me here for tea,

214
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,840
but asked me to come to watch a show.

215
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,360
To be honest, Mr. Wang,

216
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,840
the tribute tea we received

217
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,040
has been tampered with.

218
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,960
Someone secretly drugged it
with Chuanwu powder.

219
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,920
What?

220
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,560
But we've now found

221
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,280
a solution.

222
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,840
Found a solution?

223
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,320
Of course.

224
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,600
You found
washing the tea leaves can solve it?

225
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,760
Now we found it.

226
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:45,000
Thank you so much, Mr. Wang.

227
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,720
Don't mention it.

228
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:53,120
I simply enjoy helping others.

229
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,040
I have to say

230
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,840
the best teacher is right beside us.

231
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,360
Don't get too cocky.

232
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,360
You knew

233
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,040
tea washing can neutralize

234
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,000
the toxin of Chuanwu powder,

235
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,200
but

236
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,600
can you find the one
who knows how to wash the tea leaves?

237
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,240
As far as I know,

238
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,040
Haiqing Town has no such experts.

239
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,760
I'm still more skilled than you two.

240
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:29,320
When it comes to business,
you two are still newbies.

241
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,480
Mr. Wang, take care.

242
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,280
We must

243
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,240
find an expert of tea washing.

244
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,760
We found the solution now,

245
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,800
but we still couldn't let Mr. Wang off.
