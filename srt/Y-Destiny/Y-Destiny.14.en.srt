1
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:54,079
Masuk, he had boyfriend in the 1st year.

2
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,079
But his boyfriend died.

3
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,239
Since then, he wouldn't open up to anyone.

4
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,159
Do you believe in miracles?

5
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:08,079
If you do, one day you'll meet the one you miss.

6
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:09,980
It doesn't exist.

7
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:15,180
Miracles.

8
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:19,180
When the shop is closed, let's eat.

9
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,119
Masuk?

10
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,079
What is it?

11
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,239
I don't like seeing you sad.

12
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,079
I want you to know

13
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,999
that you still have me.

14
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,159
Thank you.

15
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,239
You believe in miracles?

16
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,079
Miracles are not real, uncle.

17
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,119
Tir?

18
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,079
Tir?

19
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,039
Tir?

20
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,239
Tir, don't go in.

21
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,159
Anything I can help you with?

22
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,039
Don't go in.

23
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,119
Tir.

24
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,999
This is a consecrated insect wing.

25
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:30,039
You might see the one that you miss.

26
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,159
Uncle.

27
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:09,999
Uncle.

28
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,159
Uncle.

29
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,039
Uncle.

30
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,159
Uncle.

31
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,119
Uncle.

32
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,199
Uncle.

33
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,079
I've been looking for you.

34
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,239
Why are you here?

35
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,159
I bought some rice for you.

36
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,199
Thank you, young man.

37
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,199
Uncle?

38
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,199
Last night

39
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,199
I dreamed..

40
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:04,239
Dreamed about meeting the man you love?

41
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,159
How did you know?

42
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,159
I was just guessing.

43
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:14,999
No kidding.

44
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,239
Is it because of you?

45
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,239
That I met my lover again.

46
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,119
Is it?

47
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,079
It's not me.

48
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:34,159
Something incredible can happen without us realizing it.

49
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,159
If that's true, uncle,

50
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,039
can you take me back to see him again?

51
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:57,199
If I get there in time, I might be able to save him.

52
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,999
Young man, who said he didn't believe in miracles?

53
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,039
At this point, I do now, uncle.

54
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,999
Miracles do exist.

55
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,119
Uncle,

56
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,119
help me go back to see him again.

57
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,199
But what's the use?

58
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,199
If that day, you could catch him in time

59
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,999
but he may have to go anyway.

60
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:36,999
What's done is done. We can't go back and fix it.

61
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,159
But I believe that

62
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,239
if I go back

63
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,039
I would be able to save him.

64
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:45,999
Tir?

65
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,039
Is that you?

66
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,159
Tir?

67
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,079
Masuk,

68
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,159
I bought tickets already.

69
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,239
Tir, wait for me. I'm coming right away.

70
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,039
I'll go now.

71
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,199
Tir?

72
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,159
Tir?

73
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,199
Tir?

74
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,199
Tir, we need to get out of here.

75
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,119
Let's go see elsewhere.

76
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,999
- Tir?
- Wait.

77
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,199
Can we sit first? I'm embarrassed. They're looking.

78
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,959
Tir?

79
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:43,879
Tir?

80
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:47,919
Tir?

81
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,959
Masuk, what's wrong?

82
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:11,999
Don't go in. Come out.

83
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,839
Anything I can help you with?

84
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:15,999
Tir?

85
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,919
Tir, we need to get out of here.

86
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,839
Let's go see elsewhere.

87
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,839
- Tir?
- Wait.

88
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:28,919
Can we sit first?

89
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,759
I'm embarrassed, he's watching us.

90
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:32,839
Tir?

91
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,759
Tir, listen to me, we have to go now.

92
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,839
Believe me.

93
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:39,759
Tir?

94
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,919
Tir, go now.

95
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:52,959
Tir?

96
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,839
Help!

97
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,879
Don't go in, Tir? Leave.

98
00:12:58,880 --> 00:12:59,839
Tir?

99
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:04,799
- Tir?
- Masuk, I have to help that woman.

100
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,799
No, we have to leave now.

101
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:11,919
Help!

102
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:15,839
Tir?

103
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:18,999
Tir, believed me for once.

104
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:47,879
Masuk, wait for me downstairs.

105
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:49,799
I have to help the kids first.

106
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:50,959
Please.

107
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:10,999
Tir?

108
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,919
Tir?

109
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:04,799
Uncle?

110
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,879
Tir, see this.

111
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:45,959
Masuk, you're very good.

112
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,759
I have more to show you.

113
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,919
What is it?

114
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:07,999
Tir, wait. You're gonna fall off the bridge.

115
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,839
Enough?

116
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,919
What?

117
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,839
What?

118
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:31,839
What?

119
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:32,879
People will see us.

120
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:23,919
Tir?

121
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:32,839
I miss you.

122
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:38,959
I want to meet you.

123
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,799
Masuk,

124
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,959
it's been a long time.

125
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,839
I miss you Masuk.

126
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,879
Tir?

127
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:47,860
Can I go with you?

128
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:54,959
I don't want to wake up when there's no you.

129
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,439
Masuk

130
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:46,599
It's been a long time since we've met.

131
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:53,439
I miss you, Masuk.

132
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,399
Tir?!

133
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,639
Tir...

134
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:41,599
I miss you.

135
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,639
All this time...

136
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,559
it's like a long nightmare, you know?

137
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,639
Did you know that

138
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,559
each day goes by

139
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,559
so difficultly without you here with me?

140
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:13,620
I...

141
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:18,439
can't help you.

142
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:30,559
I want all this to be just a dream.

143
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:35,479
Can I go with you?

144
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,639
Masuk..

145
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,599
Don't blame yourself again.

146
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,639
You can see

147
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,599
that even if you're there in time,

148
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,519
I still had to help that woman anyway!

149
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,599
I was destined...

150
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:16,479
to have this certain amount of time.

151
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:23,479
- No, Tir!
- Masuk!

152
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:30,639
I don't want to see you sad.
- Tir!

153
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,599
I want you to be happy

154
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:42,479
as it should be.

155
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,599
Masuk..

156
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,519
Stop the suffering!

157
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:57,519
Life is very short...

158
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:02,519
too short to be drown in suffering.

159
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:08,439
Masuk!

160
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,519
Try to open your heart...

161
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:20,399
Someone can take care of you. Make you happy.

162
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:30,519
There's no one who can replace you.

163
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,639
Tir, listen to me.

164
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,519
You are the best...

165
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,559
I love you only.

166
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:47,479
I will always love you only.

167
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,479
Believe me...

168
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,519
Masuk!

169
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:06,519
I also love you much.

170
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,599
So so much.

171
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:19,439
I can't bear to see you sad and be sorry for me like this!

172
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:33,559
I'll be watching you be happy from somewhere.

173
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,519
You promise?

174
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,479
Tir?!

175
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:46,439
Promise me that

176
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:51,399
from now on you will live a happy life...

177
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,479
Tir?!

178
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,599
I have to go!

179
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:49,559
- Why this flower?
- It's rare.

180
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:56,559
It's like, how we met, it's rare!

181
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:30,519
Today is Valentine's day.

182
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:34,519
Every time I see another couple happy,

183
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:38,519
I feel happy with them.

184
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:43,519
If today Tir is still by my side,

185
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:47,639
I would be very happy too.

186
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:53,399
I know that Tir actually never leave me.

187
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:59,559
He is probably watching over me from somewhere.

188
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:03,559
He asked me to open up to someone.

189
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,519
Let him take care of me

190
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,639
but I really don't know

191
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:16,479
anyone who wants to take care of me like he did.

192
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,559
Hia!

193
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:30,399
Masuk!

194
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:34,559
Can I sit with you?

195
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:40,439
So... how did you get up here?

196
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:47,559
Did you forget something?
I have friends living here too!

197
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:58,519
And... hey, how did you know I was here?

198
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:05,559
Well, it is where someone I like lives.

199
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,639
Why wouldn't I not know?

200
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:38,479
Hia!

201
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,439
Masuk!

202
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:53,399
From now on, can I take care of you?

203
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:58,559
I can't bear to see you regretting the past like this.

204
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:07,519
I don't ask you to forget or stop loving him?

205
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:11,479
And maybe you don't have to love me at all.

206
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:22,519
But I want to be someone who love you and take care of you.

207
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:34,519
I might not even be half as good as Tir

208
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:40,519
but I will try to be as good.

209
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:45,479
I promise.

210
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:11,639
Asking someone to be a boyfriend on V Day, you must have flowers.

211
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,519
Masuk..

212
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:52,439
It will be my duty to take care of you as good as possible.

213
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:56,439
Be my boyfriend.

214
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:46,439
Umm...

215
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,639
Masuk..

216
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:05,599
Can I hold your hands?

217
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:11,479
It's something I've wanted to do for a long time.

218
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:44,439
I have decided to open up to the people.

219
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:49,479
Let someone be a part of my feelings.

220
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,559
Hia Jia didn't replace Tir.

221
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:57,599
My thing with Tir will remain the same.

222
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:01,639
But both will be in my heart,

223
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:07,519
the heart that almost lost its faith in love.

224
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:14,599
If Tir could look from the sky,

225
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:22,599
want to tell you that I still love him, never change.

226
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:27,559
And I will do as Tir asked..

227
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:34,599
Opening up to someone who will take care of me

228
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:40,599
and I will love him like he loves me.

229
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:44,399
Thank you.

230
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:05,460
Masuk...

231
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:13,439
Is it okay if I sleep in bed too?

232
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,759
Bro...

233
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,919
Why did you bring me here?

234
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:53,919
Masuk..

235
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:59,759
I don't ask you to forget Tir.

236
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:06,919
I'm just gonna tell you that I'll take care of you so you be the happiest.

237
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:09,919
Tir...

238
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:13,799
I don't know where Tir is now.

239
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,919
but I came today

240
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:22,679
to tell and ask Tir for permission to take care of you.

241
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:32,919
I know that I can't replace Tir.

242
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,799
But I promise...

243
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:42,799
promise to love and take care of you like he used to do.

244
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:45,759
Tir, don't worry.

245
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:53,999
And one more thing.

246
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:58,879
I thank you very much for helping my nephew out safely that day.

247
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:10,879
- Please help me.
- Tir, don't go, Tir.

248
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:24,959
Wait for me downstairs. I have to help the kid first.

249
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:36,799
Tir!

250
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:40,839
Help my baby...

251
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:49,759
- Help! Help! Help!
- Anything I can help you with?!

252
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:52,799
- Please help my son.
- Yes.

253
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:02,799
Rescue team, let them through!

254
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:30,719
Tir was the bravest person my family had ever seen.

255
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,919
Tir...

256
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,839
I promise

257
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:13,919
to live happily, not drowning in suffering.

258
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,879
Just like you asked.

259
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,799
Baby Yiu?

260
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:08,799
Hello.

261
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:10,879
Pay your respects to P'Tir first.

262
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:15,759
P'Tir was a hero that help Yu out. Pay respect, quickly.

263
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:27,959
Masuk, I'm really sorry about Tir.

264
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:36,759
Tir is truly our family's hero. He saved me and my son.

265
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:42,719
If there's anything I can do for you, please tell me.

266
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:03,839
Err...

267
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:10,959
Is it okay?

268
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:15,759
If it's like this,

269
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:31,919
I'm okay.

270
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:38,959
I told you that your thing with Tir will remain the same.

271
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:44,959
Just to see you happy, I'm satisfied.

272
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:49,799
Let's eat...

273
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:15,839
Eat together, Tir.

274
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,839
To be honest,

275
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:05,919
you can come up and sleep up here.

276
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:18,839
No matter how many times I've been here, you always sleep down there.

277
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:26,839
Do you want to sleep up here?

278
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:34,879
I'm going sleep there instead.

279
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:58,799
It's okay Masuk.

280
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:01,759
Go up to bed.

281
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:05,719
So that you can sleep next to Tir!

282
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:17,919
OK.

283
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:00,879
Masuk..

284
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:05,919
Let Hia Jia sleep in bed with you.

285
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:10,959
I allow it. I have to go.

286
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:19,839
Hia Jia, come up and sleep with Masuk.

287
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:24,879
I allow it. I have to go.

288
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:44,959
Masuk..

289
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:52,799
What about I sleep in bed with you?

290
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:15,719
It's okay.

291
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:47,799
Masuk..

292
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:58,719
And what about I hug you?

293
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:13,919
OK.

294
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:04,959
Finally this semester, we have lovers now...
