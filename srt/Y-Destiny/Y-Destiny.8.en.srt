1
00:00:05,167 --> 00:00:10,082
Thurs, you know a few days ago someone found a corpse in the pool?

2
00:00:12,187 --> 00:00:12,229
Death successor...

3
00:00:15,229 --> 00:00:16,229
Are you a ghost?

4
00:00:16,292 --> 00:00:19,124
Yes, I'm a ghost. I want to ask for help.

5
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:36,207
Mon, you wait and see. I'll be more accurate today than ever

6
00:00:38,167 --> 00:00:39,124
Me likey.

7
00:00:40,208 --> 00:00:43,166
Why, Thurs? Has something happened?

8
00:00:44,208 --> 00:00:47,166
Just wait and see. I have helps.

9
00:00:47,167 --> 00:00:48,207
Let's start. I'm ready.

10
00:00:53,208 --> 00:00:54,207
Come in!

11
00:01:18,208 --> 00:01:23,124
If you're as good as you claim, tell me what I did last night.

12
00:01:34,167 --> 00:01:35,166
Drugs.

13
00:01:37,125 --> 00:01:39,166
Do you really want me talk?

14
00:01:43,292 --> 00:01:50,124
Say it, I'm sure nobody knows.

15
00:02:01,083 --> 00:02:03,249
You did some drugs.

16
00:02:08,167 --> 00:02:10,291
- Really?
- Did you do drugs?

17
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:32,207
Godfather, my brother ran away from home. Will he come back?

18
00:02:34,167 --> 00:02:36,249
Your brother is back. Now, at house front.

19
00:02:38,167 --> 00:02:41,207
Your brother is back.

20
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:46,166
Now, at house front.

21
00:02:55,167 --> 00:02:57,124
Hello mom, what's up?

22
00:02:58,208 --> 00:03:01,207
He is back. Now in front of the house.

23
00:03:03,167 --> 00:03:05,082
Ok, mom.

24
00:03:05,292 --> 00:03:08,166
Thank you, Godfather. So accurate.

25
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,166
Here, I make merit.

26
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:13,249
Come, come, come.

27
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:24,457
Come on, come on, come on in.

28
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:42,082
The Godfather is out.

29
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:44,166
Go, go, go.

30
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:47,166
So holy.

31
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:01,207
Thurs, let's go.

32
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:06,582
Why are you so accurate today?

33
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:08,207
How can you do that?

34
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:11,166
I had help.

35
00:04:12,167 --> 00:04:13,207
What help? Tell me.

36
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:19,124
I'm keeping a ghost.

37
00:04:21,167 --> 00:04:22,166
A ghost?

38
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:24,207
Yes!

39
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:27,082
Are you shitting me?

40
00:04:28,167 --> 00:04:29,166
I'm not.

41
00:04:33,167 --> 00:04:35,207
You know, a couple of days ago.

42
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:37,374
They found a corpse at the pool.

43
00:04:38,167 --> 00:04:41,291
So I want you to prove it with me. If it's true or not.

44
00:04:42,167 --> 00:04:44,082
Death successor.

45
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:58,291
Don’t tell me, it's the Ghost from Ouija that day?

46
00:04:59,167 --> 00:05:00,166
Did it follow you back?

47
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:06,166
Well, that's about it.

48
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:18,124
And is he here now?

49
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:20,166
Yes.

50
00:05:21,167 --> 00:05:22,166
Where is he?

51
00:05:23,167 --> 00:05:24,166
Behind you.

52
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:33,207
Where?

53
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:37,124
Pao, this is a very close friend of mine.

54
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:39,082
Mon.

55
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:42,207
Like. I like him, Thurs’s friend.

56
00:05:44,292 --> 00:05:48,166
Pao, you can't like him.

57
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:52,249
Mon already has a boyfriend. You're doing wrong precepts, know that?

58
00:05:53,167 --> 00:05:56,166
Well, I didn't mean to like that.

59
00:05:56,167 --> 00:05:57,166
We like him as a friend.

60
00:05:58,292 --> 00:05:59,166
Oh.

61
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:07,207
You tell your friend that he can't like me.

62
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:10,166
I have a boyfriend.

63
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:14,166
And he is very cruel too.

64
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,166
- You heard him.
- Umm.

65
00:06:17,292 --> 00:06:21,166
You can't just tell people you like them.

66
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:22,124
Know that?

67
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:26,166
Me likey.

68
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:29,166
Told you not to say that.

69
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:35,291
Thurs, I think I'd better go.

70
00:06:36,167 --> 00:06:38,166
Oh, is that so?

71
00:06:38,292 --> 00:06:42,207
Tell him, he doesn't have to send me off.

72
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:47,166
I have no manners, bye.

73
00:06:48,167 --> 00:06:49,166
Hey, I'll send you off.

74
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:44,166
Pao, you were very good.

75
00:07:45,167 --> 00:07:50,124
Is there anything you want or something special to eat?

76
00:07:51,167 --> 00:07:52,166
I’ll make merit for you.

77
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:54,166
- Really?
- Um.

78
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:59,249
So... I want to eat soda pop.

79
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:03,124
No one had make merit for me.

80
00:08:04,292 --> 00:08:06,207
- Soft drink?
- Yeah.

81
00:08:08,208 --> 00:08:10,166
Well, it's true.

82
00:08:11,167 --> 00:08:13,207
Who'd make merit for the dead with soda pop.

83
00:08:16,167 --> 00:08:19,291
- Okay, I'll arrange it for you.
- Yeah.

84
00:08:20,292 --> 00:08:23,207
Anyway, thank you so much.

85
00:08:34,292 --> 00:08:38,124
Did you forge that I don't have a body?

86
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:51,124
I know.

87
00:08:52,167 --> 00:08:55,291
So that's it.

88
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:07,249
- Okay?
- Um.

89
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:10,124
Thank you very much.

90
00:09:12,167 --> 00:09:13,166
Thank you, too.

91
00:09:35,167 --> 00:09:36,291
Thurs, you lying asshole.

92
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:38,166
Today I will avenge you.

93
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:40,082
What lying asshole?

94
00:09:40,167 --> 00:09:41,166
Where are you going?

95
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:44,207
Nope.

96
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:00,124
Don't harm him.

97
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:02,166
Get out!

98
00:10:03,292 --> 00:10:05,120
Don’t let me see your face again.

99
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:06,291
I'll get my revenge.

100
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:11,207
Pao?

101
00:10:13,167 --> 00:10:14,166
Are you okay? Thurs?

102
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:18,207
It's okay. Thanks, Pao.

103
00:10:23,167 --> 00:10:26,207
Is this true or is it a dream?

104
00:10:27,167 --> 00:10:30,124
Dream. This is your dream.

105
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:34,291
I see you have nightmare so I came to help you. Don't want you to have nightmares.

106
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:40,124
And in my dreams, you have body?

107
00:10:41,167 --> 00:10:42,082
Yes.

108
00:10:44,167 --> 00:10:47,082
OMG, I can touch you.

109
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:03,166
You want to hang around? can take you to travel in my world.

110
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:05,249
I do.

111
00:11:06,167 --> 00:11:07,166
Come.

112
00:11:11,167 --> 00:11:13,166
- Go.
- Go.

113
00:11:54,292 --> 00:11:58,166
Did you forget that I don’t have a body?

114
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:02,249
So that's it.

115
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:39,124
- Pao.
- Had a good dream?

116
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:02,124
A very good dream.

117
00:13:18,292 --> 00:13:23,166
How did you know that I had nightmares?

118
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:29,124
In human’s dream, there is a dream devil.

119
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:33,124
Its duty is to give you nightmares.

120
00:13:33,167 --> 00:13:38,124
I don't want you to have nightmares so I went in

121
00:13:38,292 --> 00:13:39,291
and found what we saw.

122
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:53,166
Let’s go to make merit.

123
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,082
Make merit.

124
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:58,207
- I'll put some soda in for you.
- Go.

125
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:10,124
Thurs, you are talking alone.

126
00:14:10,146 --> 00:14:11,146
Do you know that?

127
00:14:31,792 --> 00:14:32,916
Looking bright.

128
00:14:34,792 --> 00:14:36,791
When did you secretly style your hair?

129
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:37,874
This?

130
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:41,832
That is, I can choose to change my shape.

131
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:46,916
Can you turn into an Ultraman?

132
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:51,957
Oh no, no. I only can do simple.

133
00:14:57,917 --> 00:14:58,957
I can remember something.

134
00:15:00,917 --> 00:15:01,916
What?

135
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:05,249
I was killed in a car accident

136
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:08,749
in some street.

137
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,791
And?

138
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:13,957
I can only remember this.

139
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,791
If there’s something I can help, tell me.

140
00:15:31,875 --> 00:15:34,832
- Yeah.
- OK.

141
00:15:36,792 --> 00:15:40,832
Well, what about soda? Good?

142
00:15:40,917 --> 00:15:42,832
Tingling like it burn all my stomach.

143
00:15:42,917 --> 00:15:44,874
You drank a lot so it burn your stomach.

144
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:45,999
Don't you like it?

145
00:15:47,917 --> 00:15:49,791
I'll make merit for you again.

146
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:51,999
- You said so!
- Yes.

147
00:15:52,917 --> 00:15:54,957
Next time, change the flavor.

148
00:15:55,792 --> 00:15:57,832
How's this hairstyle? Is it okay?

149
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:02,832
It's extra ordinary.

150
00:16:02,917 --> 00:16:03,957
Thurs, do you like it?

151
00:16:04,917 --> 00:16:06,832
I won't tell you.

152
00:16:09,792 --> 00:16:11,874
Tell me, I want to know.

153
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:14,249
Transform into an Ultraman first.

154
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:15,832
It's nothing.

155
00:16:16,792 --> 00:16:17,916
What can you transform into?

156
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:20,166
Ones you said they were easy.

157
00:16:22,792 --> 00:16:23,832
What kind that you like?

158
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:26,832
Thurs?

159
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:31,832
You're talking alone. Do you know that?

160
00:16:48,917 --> 00:16:50,832
I’ll go to the bathroom first.

161
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:54,832
- Bye.
- OK.

162
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:15,916
Pao?

163
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,791
Let's go on a trip.

164
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:29,916
What are you doing?

165
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,999
Just hanging around.

166
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,832
So where will you take me to next?

167
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:45,999
We can go anywhere. Where you want to go?

168
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:53,999
I don't know.

169
00:17:55,792 --> 00:17:56,916
If I was going with you, it's enough.

170
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:00,957
I like to go out with you. I feel safe.

171
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:08,666
Sure is. This is my world, I can protect you.

172
00:18:14,917 --> 00:18:15,874
Pao.

173
00:18:16,917 --> 00:18:19,957
Can I stay here with you forever?

174
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:22,916
I don't want to wake up.

175
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:24,957
No.

176
00:18:26,917 --> 00:18:32,791
If you don't wake up, your soul will go to the spirit world.

177
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,874
Then we will never meet again.

178
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,749
You must follow your path of karma.

179
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:43,791
Karma path?

180
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:57,791
Pao, do you know how I feel about you?

181
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:04,957
I know.

182
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:08,874
I feel the love that you have for me

183
00:19:10,917 --> 00:19:11,832
but

184
00:19:14,792 --> 00:19:18,832
I'm a spirit. We live in different worlds.

185
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:22,749
We could not end up with each other.

186
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:26,916
You can be with me, like this.

187
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:33,749
Awaken and in dreams. With you, it's enough.

188
00:19:36,917 --> 00:19:39,957
Thurs, it's nearly my time to go.

189
00:19:43,792 --> 00:19:46,791
But we don't know when.

190
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:54,832
I still haven't helped you enough.

191
00:19:57,917 --> 00:20:03,124
He said that my time is near. I don't know too.

192
00:20:04,917 --> 00:20:06,749
Or,

193
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:12,999
if one day, you really have to go,

194
00:20:13,917 --> 00:20:18,916
tell me in advance. So I have time to adapt.

195
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,957
I promise. I'll tell you.

196
00:20:29,958 --> 00:20:37,791
Then I will take a deposit from you so you don't break this contract.

197
00:20:37,958 --> 00:20:38,916
Huh?

198
00:20:46,917 --> 00:20:49,957
Thurs, you can't do this.

199
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:52,916
- Why?
- If you kiss me, your life will be shorter.

200
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:57,291
I promise, if I go, I will tell you.

201
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:01,957
I don't know. I don't care.

202
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:04,832
I just want to stay with you.

203
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:12,791
Really?

204
00:21:30,875 --> 00:21:31,832
Are you satisfied?

205
00:21:36,833 --> 00:21:38,791
A ghost can be shy?

206
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:54,832
Thurs, lots of people are looking. I'll go.

207
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:55,896
No need.

208
00:22:11,875 --> 00:22:13,916
Thurs, you're up?

209
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:17,874
Take a shower. We have soy milk and fried dough.

210
00:22:19,958 --> 00:22:23,916
Oh... what did you do with my room?

211
00:22:23,958 --> 00:22:26,874
Why does it look much cleaner?

212
00:22:30,917 --> 00:22:32,957
And..

213
00:22:34,958 --> 00:22:40,957
- How are these food here?
- Just whispered to people you foretold

214
00:22:40,958 --> 00:22:44,916
that the Godfather wanted to eat them.

215
00:22:46,833 --> 00:22:48,874
- Really?
- Um.

216
00:22:49,792 --> 00:22:53,749
- You’re a cunning ghost - Try eating it.

217
00:22:56,833 --> 00:23:00,874
How's it? Is it delicious?
- Well... it's delicious.

218
00:23:02,792 --> 00:23:04,916
- Do you want it ?!
- Umm.

219
00:23:24,958 --> 00:23:26,791
Thurs?

220
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:30,957
People are looking. Should I go?

221
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,916
No need.

222
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:38,957
Friends from faculty.

223
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,874
When met, it's normal to look and say hi.

224
00:23:42,958 --> 00:23:44,957
Or maybe...

225
00:23:44,958 --> 00:23:51,957
- just that they see a handsome someone.
- That's not true.

226
00:23:52,833 --> 00:23:55,916
- Let's go downstairs.
- Um.

227
00:24:34,958 --> 00:24:36,791
I guess so. Is he dating a ghost? I heard.

228
00:24:36,833 --> 00:24:37,916
I think he's super high.
Look at his eyes, I know this symptom.

229
00:24:37,958 --> 00:24:41,416
I used to have a crush on him. First year turned zombie.

230
00:24:49,917 --> 00:24:51,874
Thurs?

231
00:24:52,833 --> 00:24:54,874
Are you okay?

232
00:24:56,833 --> 00:24:57,874
Thurs?

233
00:24:57,917 --> 00:25:01,874
Something I can help you with? You okay?

234
00:25:04,792 --> 00:25:06,874
We'd like to be alone.

235
00:25:09,792 --> 00:25:11,874
You don't want me to stay?

236
00:25:16,792 --> 00:25:18,749
Told you that I want to be alone.

237
00:25:18,792 --> 00:25:20,874
Thurs?

238
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,916
If there's anything, you can tell us.

239
00:25:26,958 --> 00:25:29,832
We can help you with anything.

240
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,957
No need.

241
00:25:33,875 --> 00:25:35,916
Want to be alone.

242
00:25:39,958 --> 00:25:41,999
Are you sure?

243
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:48,832
- You can tell me, if there's anything...
- Oh, I'm sure.

244
00:25:48,958 --> 00:25:52,999
I said I want to be alone, understand? Why are you still talking?

245
00:25:53,792 --> 00:25:56,749
Fuck off, man.

246
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,957
Thurs?

247
00:26:01,833 --> 00:26:03,916
Are you okay?

248
00:26:04,792 --> 00:26:06,832
Thurs?

249
00:26:30,875 --> 00:26:34,999
You know how I feel about you?

250
00:26:35,833 --> 00:26:39,916
I'm a ghost. We could not end up together.

251
00:26:40,792 --> 00:26:42,916
You can be with me, like this.

252
00:26:42,958 --> 00:26:49,916
When awaken and in my dream. It's enough.

253
00:26:50,875 --> 00:26:54,874
You know you can tell us. We can help you.

254
00:26:54,917 --> 00:26:58,832
I said I want to be alone, understand? Why are you still talking?

255
00:26:58,958 --> 00:27:01,999
Fuck off, man.

256
00:27:23,792 --> 00:27:27,916
Several days later...

257
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,916
Pao...

258
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,832
Pao, come out.

259
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:46,749
Don't be a sensitive ghost.

260
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:52,832
Up to you. Just out with you is enough.

261
00:27:53,833 --> 00:27:56,832
Sure. This is my world...

262
00:27:56,875 --> 00:27:58,957
I can protect you.

263
00:28:12,958 --> 00:28:14,874
Pao...

264
00:28:14,958 --> 00:28:17,916
I know you are here.

265
00:28:19,833 --> 00:28:21,791
Pao...

266
00:28:21,958 --> 00:28:26,874
- Pao...
- You're not going to chase me away again?

267
00:28:31,833 --> 00:28:33,999
Pao...

268
00:28:40,792 --> 00:28:44,874
I'm sorry, for talking badly to you.

269
00:28:44,958 --> 00:28:47,874
Pao, don't leave me again.

270
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,749
was never angry at you.

271
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:05,874
Where did you go? And why can I touch you?

272
00:29:06,875 --> 00:29:10,791
Not just you who can touch me.

273
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:14,791
I can touch you as well.

274
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:18,916
I'm sorry for not telling you.

275
00:29:18,958 --> 00:29:21,832
I didn't intend to leave you.

276
00:29:21,875 --> 00:29:23,999
There was a big merit event.

277
00:29:24,792 --> 00:29:27,916
That's why you can touch me.

278
00:29:28,792 --> 00:29:30,874
This is good.

279
00:29:31,917 --> 00:29:35,999
So you won't leave me again, right?

280
00:29:36,833 --> 00:29:40,874
I'm glad, like this, I can catch you.

281
00:29:45,833 --> 00:29:47,749
Thurs,

282
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:58,874
I came this time. It's the last time.

283
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,957
It is almost that time.

284
00:30:05,792 --> 00:30:08,791
I have to go, Thurs.

285
00:30:12,792 --> 00:30:15,791
We will meet again.

286
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:23,749
I don't want you to go.

287
00:30:23,875 --> 00:30:25,957
The big merit you receive.

288
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:28,957
Did you learn more?

289
00:30:30,958 --> 00:30:34,791
- Teach me.
- Yes.

290
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:37,874
I know stories

291
00:30:37,917 --> 00:30:41,999
so I know for sure that we will meet again.

292
00:30:45,833 --> 00:30:49,832
But you said you will not leave me.

293
00:30:53,917 --> 00:30:57,874
You said you'll be here beside me?

294
00:31:00,875 --> 00:31:04,874
Can we stay together like this forever?

295
00:31:09,833 --> 00:31:12,791
My time is over.

296
00:31:12,875 --> 00:31:14,957
I can only tell you this.

297
00:31:15,917 --> 00:31:20,874
Can you trust me that we will meet again.

298
00:31:21,917 --> 00:31:23,916
From now on..

299
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,874
take care of yourself.

300
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:49,749
My name is Thurs.

301
00:31:49,792 --> 00:31:52,874
I like this name. Likey.

302
00:31:53,792 --> 00:31:55,749
Do you want this?

303
00:31:55,833 --> 00:31:59,791
Did you forget that I don’t have a body?

304
00:31:59,833 --> 00:32:03,874
So that's it.

305
00:32:25,833 --> 00:32:32,874
- Are you a ghost?
- If we can meet, there is some bond.

306
00:32:32,875 --> 00:32:36,916
Did you know how I feel about you?

307
00:32:36,958 --> 00:32:41,957
can feel the love you have for me, but...

308
00:32:42,875 --> 00:32:46,874
I'm a ghost. We live in different worlds.

309
00:32:46,875 --> 00:32:49,957
We could not end up together.

310
00:33:01,792 --> 00:33:03,957
Pao...

311
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:13,749
You and him are soul mates.

312
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:16,791
There will be reason to meet.

313
00:33:51,167 --> 00:33:53,166
Pao...

314
00:33:59,083 --> 00:34:02,082
Today I come to make merit for you.

315
00:34:08,042 --> 00:34:11,041
I wish you happiness

316
00:34:14,125 --> 00:34:16,999
and calm.

317
00:34:22,083 --> 00:34:24,166
I miss you.

318
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,041
Father,

319
00:34:43,167 --> 00:34:45,166
Take the blessing.

320
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:51,124
Prayer

321
00:34:53,167 --> 00:34:55,082
Thurs,

322
00:34:55,167 --> 00:34:58,082
cannot meet is suffering.

323
00:34:59,083 --> 00:35:03,124
Met and parted is also suffering.

324
00:35:09,958 --> 00:35:14,082
To meet then have to separated like this,

325
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,999
it'd better if we never have met.

326
00:35:20,958 --> 00:35:24,166
Now I miss him a lot.

327
00:35:26,042 --> 00:35:30,124
You and him are soul mates.

328
00:35:30,167 --> 00:35:35,082
There will be reasons to meet.

329
00:35:35,958 --> 00:35:38,124
Luang Father used to say that...

330
00:35:38,167 --> 00:35:41,082
I have to help him.

331
00:35:42,167 --> 00:35:45,166
I haven't had help him yet.

332
00:35:48,958 --> 00:35:51,124
He left first.

333
00:35:51,167 --> 00:35:54,041
In fact,

334
00:35:54,083 --> 00:35:59,166
you've helped him since you met the first time.

335
00:36:00,083 --> 00:36:02,166
How?

336
00:36:03,083 --> 00:36:07,082
The world in which we live in,

337
00:36:07,083 --> 00:36:12,124
it's not only to only world.

338
00:36:14,042 --> 00:36:21,041
Both worlds exist in parallel at the same time.

339
00:36:21,042 --> 00:36:24,166
Since the past and the unforeseen future.

340
00:36:24,958 --> 00:36:30,999
Perhaps that person may come from the other world in the future

341
00:36:31,083 --> 00:36:35,957
to tell the person he'd made merit with

342
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:43,082
to help his future, to make it right in time.

343
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:49,082
Because it was not yet the time to leave,

344
00:36:49,958 --> 00:36:53,166
I can tell you just this much.

345
00:36:53,958 --> 00:36:58,124
And when you meet again,

346
00:36:59,042 --> 00:37:04,082
then you will know it everything.

347
00:37:11,125 --> 00:37:14,041
Goodbye.

348
00:37:36,958 --> 00:37:39,082
Pao come out, see me.

349
00:37:39,125 --> 00:37:42,582
I know that you are here...

350
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,999
Pao. Pao. Pao..

351
00:37:53,125 --> 00:37:58,166
- Not Pao?
- Yes, I'm not who you are looking for.

352
00:37:58,958 --> 00:38:03,124
I came to thank you that tirade menit for me today at the pool where our bodies were found.

353
00:38:04,125 --> 00:38:05,166
Oh!

354
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,082
Isn't it Pao's corpse over there?

355
00:38:08,083 --> 00:38:11,166
I was left there for a while until I was found.

356
00:38:11,167 --> 00:38:14,124
Now my relatives are pi®k<ing me up. To bring me home.

357
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:17,166
The person you're looking for, you will see him soon.

358
00:38:17,583 --> 00:38:23,957
Hope you help everyone you have a ©hance. Then you will meet him.

359
00:38:25,167 --> 00:38:29,124
A couple of days ago, someone found a corpse at the pool.

360
00:38:29,167 --> 00:38:30,999
A male...

361
00:38:35,417 --> 00:38:38,041
It's time now.

362
00:38:38,083 --> 00:38:43,999
He has come. Nightmare will turn out good.

363
00:38:44,042 --> 00:38:46,041
Wh

364
00:38:46,083 --> 00:38:51,040
- I wish you cross the cycle line.
- Thank you.

365
00:39:15,958 --> 00:39:23,124
Several days later...

366
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,041
Watch out!

367
00:39:44,125 --> 00:39:46,041
Pao...

368
00:39:47,083 --> 00:39:50,041
Pao...

369
00:39:51,042 --> 00:39:56,041
- You're back right?
- I can't breathe.

370
00:39:56,167 --> 00:39:58,166
I'm sorry.

371
00:39:59,167 --> 00:40:01,999
I was too happy.

372
00:40:03,083 --> 00:40:06,041
You're back?

373
00:40:06,958 --> 00:40:10,999
You remembered the wrong person.
I'm not Pao.

374
00:40:12,083 --> 00:40:14,166
My time has ended?

375
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,124
Can you trust me that we will meet again?

376
00:40:18,125 --> 00:40:21,041
- We remember something.
- What?

377
00:40:21,083 --> 00:40:23,166
I was killed in a car accident.

378
00:40:23,167 --> 00:40:27,041
At one street.

379
00:40:27,083 --> 00:40:30,082
Pae, it is.

380
00:40:33,083 --> 00:40:35,124
Why I feel so familiar to you?

381
00:40:35,167 --> 00:40:38,041
Have we ever known each other before?

382
00:40:38,167 --> 00:40:40,120
We did.

383
00:40:41,125 --> 00:40:43,999
Very well.

384
00:40:45,125 --> 00:40:48,124
We are very close.

385
00:40:49,167 --> 00:40:51,957
Take a good look.

386
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,124
Do you remember?

387
00:41:00,687 --> 00:41:02,271
Don't you remember?

388
00:41:08,187 --> 00:41:10,229
I can't remember.

389
00:41:17,782 --> 00:41:20,781
You said you will not going to forget me?

390
00:41:22,657 --> 00:41:24,614
You said..

391
00:41:25,615 --> 00:41:28,739
If you come back, you will remember?

392
00:41:29,782 --> 00:41:34,781
You said you will remember?

393
00:41:34,782 --> 00:41:38,572
My name is Thurs.

394
00:41:38,657 --> 00:41:40,739
Thurs..

395
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:44,739
I remember your name.

396
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:49,614
Yes...

397
00:41:50,782 --> 00:41:53,697
Do you remember anything else?

398
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:56,781
Think about it.

399
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:01,781
Just remember this.

400
00:42:05,657 --> 00:42:08,656
This is very good already.

401
00:42:18,698 --> 00:42:21,739
Why are you crying?

402
00:42:22,657 --> 00:42:24,781
Thank you.

403
00:42:25,782 --> 00:42:29,697
This is already enough.

404
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:45,781
Thank you too.

405
00:42:54,782 --> 00:42:57,781
- Well, what about Pao?
- I like it.

406
00:42:57,782 --> 00:42:59,656
Hey!!

407
00:43:00,115 --> 00:43:01,781
Put this outside. This one inside.

408
00:43:01,990 --> 00:43:05,739
Huh... It's time for you to work.

409
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:08,697
- Why are you so accurate today?
- I'm keeping ghosts.

410
00:43:09,198 --> 00:43:11,614
- When did you secretly style your hair?
- And do you like it?

411
00:43:11,698 --> 00:43:21,697
- Did you know how I feel about you?
- I can feel the love that you have for me.

412
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:45,781
Prayer

413
00:43:45,782 --> 00:43:48,739
You met once again.

414
00:43:48,782 --> 00:43:54,614
Everything has its duty and time.

415
00:44:05,698 --> 00:44:09,697
- Let's go feed the fish.
- Let's go...

416
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:17,739
Look at that one. It is so big.

417
00:44:18,782 --> 00:44:20,697
Pae...

418
00:44:20,782 --> 00:44:24,572
How do you feel about making merit today?

419
00:44:24,782 --> 00:44:26,781
So happy.

420
00:44:27,573 --> 00:44:30,572
Well, I just remembered...

421
00:44:30,615 --> 00:44:34,572
that I haven't repaid you how you helped me that day.

422
00:44:34,782 --> 00:44:37,781
If you didn't help me, I would have been pretty troubled.

423
00:44:37,782 --> 00:44:44,739
It's alright. I have to help you anyway.

424
00:44:45,615 --> 00:44:49,781
Well... even when you was Pao,

425
00:44:50,573 --> 00:44:55,781
you took care of me both while sleeping and waking up.

426
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:04,739
It might sound unbelievable.

427
00:45:04,782 --> 00:45:10,739
But the two of us have actually met.

428
00:45:17,740 --> 00:45:19,656
Thurs..

429
00:45:20,573 --> 00:45:25,614
Even though I can't remember when I was Pao,

430
00:45:25,782 --> 00:45:28,656
But I believe it's destiny

431
00:45:28,657 --> 00:45:31,614
that the two of us meet.

432
00:45:31,698 --> 00:45:38,656
And now I feel unbelievably familiar to you.

433
00:45:40,782 --> 00:45:43,614
I don't know..

434
00:45:43,657 --> 00:45:46,781
that it was fate

435
00:45:46,782 --> 00:45:50,697
or is it because of destiny

436
00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:54,697
that brings us back together again

437
00:45:57,615 --> 00:46:01,781
but there is one thing that I'd like to say

438
00:46:03,782 --> 00:46:09,614
Can we make move on you?

439
00:46:16,782 --> 00:46:18,781
Well..

440
00:46:31,657 --> 00:46:35,281
I don't want to be someone who gets moves.

441
00:46:35,782 --> 00:46:38,739
I want to be you boyfriend.

442
00:46:40,573 --> 00:46:45,739
- So, we are a couple?
- Um.

443
00:46:46,698 --> 00:46:49,572
You, the cutest.

444
00:46:49,782 --> 00:46:52,614
Let's feed the fish.

445
00:46:52,657 --> 00:46:56,572
As a person, you are a lot more teasing!

446
00:46:56,615 --> 00:46:58,697
Pao is not teasing?

447
00:47:00,698 --> 00:47:02,572
No.

448
00:47:18,573 --> 00:47:19,697
Look.

449
00:47:19,782 --> 00:47:22,614
It's the same.

450
00:47:24,698 --> 00:47:29,656
I think it must be destiny.
