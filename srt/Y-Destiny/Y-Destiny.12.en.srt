1
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,599
There is another thing

2
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,679
that you may have forgotten.

3
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,759
We're not friends anymore...

4
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:57,820
Will it be okay

5
00:00:58,780 --> 00:00:59,820
if I wish that we

6
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:01,020
be friends again?

7
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:06,380
Sat, you don't have to ask.

8
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:07,519
Because for me,

9
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,580
you are my best friend anyway.

10
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:15,180
One more kiss and I won't be a friend anymore.

11
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,239
One more kiss and

12
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,079
I won't be a friend anymore.

13
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,239
Choke...

14
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,279
Sat...

15
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,239
Are you awake?

16
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,759
Umm.

17
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,999
Did you sleep well?

18
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,839
What are you doing?

19
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,079
Smell so good.

20
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,079
I'm cooking.

21
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,119
Khun Sat please sit over there.

22
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,439
Food for you, Khun Sat.

23
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,879
But I don't know if we can eat it.

24
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,039
You still remember

25
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,519
what I like to eat?

26
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,199
I do remember.

27
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:45,999
Is it delicious?

28
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,319
Umm...

29
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,159
Ah.

30
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,439
Sat...

31
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,039
After finish eating...

32
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,879
I have a surprise.

33
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,679
Umm.

34
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,199
I'll be hurry.

35
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,359
Umm.

36
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,439
What is this?

37
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,239
Just walk.

38
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:39,919
Take a seat.

39
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,679
Umm.

40
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,399
Don't open your eyes yet.

41
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,759
Umm.

42
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,279
What?

43
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,039
What surprise?

44
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,079
What are you doing?

45
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,079
It's all messy, Sat.

46
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,039
Here, chewing gum,

47
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,759
a surprise.

48
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,679
Umm

49
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,399
Just like when we were kids.

50
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,799
Umm.

51
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,279
Eat.

52
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,599
Otherwise...

53
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,559
Shall we do a contest?

54
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,519
Okay.

55
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,239
The smallest one loses.

56
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,359
- Umm.
- Umm.

57
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:00,879
I'll do my best.

58
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,719
Letting you on, it's okay.

59
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,039
Try again.

60
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,399
Yes!

61
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,039
Can't blow.

62
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,599
Hey, it's okay.

63
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,550
Try one more time.

64
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,279
I can't.

65
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,639
Choke...

66
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,919
Why did we stop being friends?

67
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,839
It's been a long time, Sat.

68
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,159
Don't bring it up.

69
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,119
Tell me, Choke.

70
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:28,879
I want to know.

71
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,639
Well, that day, Sat...

72
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,839
I made you a Gundam

73
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,159
Then we played together...

74
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:48,879
At the playground...

75
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,479
Then you punched me...

76
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,279
and then chase us away..

77
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,079
so you could enter Top's gang.

78
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,839
Plus, you just left my Gundam there...

79
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,639
like a piece of garbage.

80
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,839
But... what's done is done.

81
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,319
I totally forgot about it.

82
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,879
Choke..

83
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,999
Hmm?

84
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,559
I'm sorry...

85
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,279
I've done bad things to you.

86
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,079
was so bad.

87
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,039
It's understandable that..

88
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,759
you wouldn't be with me.

89
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,639
Sat...

90
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,959
Choke...

91
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,079
I really thank you.

92
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,719
Well, I have some business.

93
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:25,999
I have to go.

94
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,399
Hey, do you guys think like me?

95
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,239
That Sat has changed.

96
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,559
Like he's idiotic.

97
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,199
Spoken like a primary grade kid.

98
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,359
What's up with him, your friend?

99
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,439
My friend?

100
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,599
I don't be friends with idiots.

101
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,719
If it wasn't that..

102
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,119
when I walk with him, I look good.

103
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,279
I'm not going.

104
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,759
Hey, do you guys think like me?

105
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,599
That Sat has changed.

106
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,159
Like he's idiotic.

107
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,639
Spoken like a primary grade kid.

108
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,799
I don't be friend with idiots.

109
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,799
If it wasn't that..

110
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,199
when I walk with him, I look good.

111
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,079
I'm not going.

112
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,599
I guess he's like this...

113
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,239
because he did too hard.

114
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,359
I say...

115
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,639
you get rid off him.

116
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,479
I can't take it anymore.

117
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,359
I'll lead.

118
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,919
Well, do it for us.

119
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,759
So... Mom and Dad...

120
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,359
never want to go back in time

121
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,460
to fix the past?

122
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,919
We had fun in this bathroom that night.

123
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,439
How about tonight?

124
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,839
What the fuck? No.

125
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,999
Hey! Don't touch me.

126
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,599
But, that day...

127
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,999
- we had sex here.
- Hey! No!

128
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,319
Do you know these people?

129
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,159
These people?

130
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,959
They are all your one night lovers.

131
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,599
I didn't have prob with your shirt

132
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,279
But I have problems and hate

133
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,839
that you're acting disgusting.

134
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,039
Let's go.

135
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,719
Slut. I don't want to catch a disease.

136
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,799
What's disgusting?

137
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,639
What's happening?

138
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,919
I guess he's like this...

139
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,799
because he did it too hard.

140
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,679
I think..

141
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,599
you should leave him.

142
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,439
I can't take it anymore.

143
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,439
I made this Gundam for you...

144
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,279
And then we played together...

145
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:08,959
Then you punched me...

146
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:11,679
and then chased me away..

147
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,999
so that you could hang with Top's gang.

148
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,039
You also left my Gundam there...

149
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:19,959
like a piece of garbage,

150
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,239
I don't be friend with such idiot.

151
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:29,999
Let's go.

152
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,759
Slut. I don't want to catch a disease.

153
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,359
You should leave him.

154
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,159
I can't take it anymore.

155
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,079
was really bad.

156
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,359
It's understandable

157
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,679
that you will not be with me.

158
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:34,959
Will it really work, Choke?

159
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,479
Yes, if you don't believe it... try.

160
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,159
It really works?

161
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:51,519
Yes.

162
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,239
Mother...

163
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,359
Can I have a hundred baht please?

164
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,519
I want to go buy some snacks.

165
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,079
Over there! Go get it from your father.

166
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,519
I've prepared for you.

167
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,399
And don't go home too late.

168
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,439
Yes!

169
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,839
Go!

170
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,399
- Dad.
- What's up?

171
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,079
Who's coming to get a hundred baht?

172
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,159
Me!

173
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:29,959
Here.

174
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,879
- And don't come home late.
- Yes, thank you.

175
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,159
Let's go!

176
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,679
Sat! Sat!

177
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,199
- What are you doing here in secret?
- No, no!

178
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,799
Go away.

179
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,559
You can see that you're secretly shaving.

180
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,679
You're still too young to learn to shave.

181
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,559
The voice is still not matured yet.

182
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,679
- Why so hurry to be a man?
- Go out.

183
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,199
Go out. I will tell mother.

184
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,719
Came in without permission

185
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,990
Do I have to ask for permission?

186
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,239
This room is also my room.
- Go out.

187
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,839
It's our room, isn't it?

188
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,519
This is my room.

189
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,079
Why ask permission? Crazy!

190
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,039
Mother! Help me!

191
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,799
- P'Sam is teasing me!
- Mother, mother, mother...

192
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,359
- He talks bad too.
- Cry now, call mother.

193
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,999
Get out! Go out!

194
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,839
Oh! Sat!

195
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:22,919
Mother!

196
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,279
Mother! I miss you so much.

197
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,319
I miss you too, son!

198
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,799
How are you? Didn't come home for long.

199
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,839
Yes, I'm sorry, mom.

200
00:23:58,800 --> 00:23:59,799
After this..

201
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,279
I'll be coming home often, mom.

202
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,279
Dad still jokes like this?

203
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:30,839
I'm a grown up.

204
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,279
Well, you are still my bad boy. The same.

205
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,519
How are you?

206
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,159
Father and son.

207
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,239
Mom, you jokes too?

208
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,999
You went away, did you have fun?

209
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:07,039
It's alright. Pity you two didn't come too.

210
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,799
I bought a lot of stuff.

211
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,159
And when will Sam come back?

212
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,239
miss him so badly.

213
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,279
The end of this year, baby.

214
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,599
But now you're...

215
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:22,959
18 years old, are you satisfied?

216
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,039
Freedom!

217
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,719
Sat! Eat something else.

218
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,559
You'd only drink milk and nothing else?

219
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:45,119
Mom, I wanna to be a man.

220
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,959
I want to go to college.

221
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,679
I want to hang out with friends, like Sam

222
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:55,039
Why you want to run away from your parents?

223
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:58,199
Sam is big, he can take care of himself.

224
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:01,279
He's in college, son. He can go anywhere.

225
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:04,239
Yes, as your father said.

226
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:07,519
One day when you're 18.

227
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,679
You can be where or do what you want.

228
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:12,519
We won't say a thing.

229
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,359
But now, you're still a child.

230
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,399
I'm not a child anymore, mom.

231
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,439
Why do people say that I'm a child.

232
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,839
I want to be the same age as P'Sam.

233
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,439
Want to be handsome Hike Sam..

234
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,359
Don't want to be a child anymore.

235
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,119
There are some

236
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,319
good, and bad.

237
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,199
Teenage life.

238
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,439
But I think

239
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,519
I want to go back to being a child.

240
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,959
Now what?

241
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,119
When a child...

242
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,559
you want to be an adult.

243
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,759
But when you grew up

244
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,999
you want to go back to being a kid again.

245
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,639
Sat...

246
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,239
What happened in the past...

247
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,879
is in the past, baby.

248
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,119
We have to move on.

249
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,839
Then... Mom and Dad..

250
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,519
never want to go back in time

251
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:22,679
to fix the past?

252
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,559
No, Sat.

253
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,559
I think everything that happened...

254
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,479
is always good.

255
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,439
Come. Let's eat.

256
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,199
Come!

257
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:54,559
This dish, I did my best.

258
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,159
For you.

259
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,039
Very tasty.

260
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,279
- Smells good too.
- Here!

261
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,759
Here, your favorite sausage.

262
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,079
Eat.

263
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,519
Sat, can I take a picture?

264
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,599
Yes, yes.

265
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,679
Sat...

266
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,999
Alright, let's go eat.

267
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:26,879
Yes.

268
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,839
Come. One, two, three.

269
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,799
OK, thank you.

270
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,359
P'Sat, P'Top?

271
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,599
Well, the college will make a new series.

272
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,519
Can we take a clip of you to promote it?

273
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:43,919
What do you think, Top?

274
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:45,839
Yes, sure.

275
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,039
- Thank you.
- Yes.

276
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,159
- You go first.
- One, two, three...

277
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:55,519
Sat...

278
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,399
I have this for you.

279
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:00,959
Do you want some?

280
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,359
So you'll be in a better mood.

281
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:48,550
Happy Valentine's Day.

282
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,479
Today you dressed up very nicely?

283
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:55,180
Where are you going?

284
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,639
Oh Sat! Why are you here?

285
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,359
How did you know that I am here?

286
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:01,279
I secretly saw a picture in your room.

287
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,799
So I looked into your Facebook account..

288
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,319
I saw you've been checking in here often.

289
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:07,959
So I come try.

290
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,399
Hey, but I come here often too.

291
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,799
Maybe we just didn't met.

292
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:14,879
You're good detective.

293
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,239
No...

294
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,999
Uh, but... you are here...

295
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,119
is there any on your mind

296
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,279
Or... anything you want me to help?

297
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,879
No, I'm fine.

298
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:33,919
We just want to see you.

299
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:45,839
When I'm with you,

300
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,079
I feel comfortable.

301
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,599
It's safe. Don't know why.

302
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,199
Can I come to see you often?

303
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,199
Sure.

304
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,999
As often as you please.

305
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:32,799
Choke...

306
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,279
It's been a long time since we've seen this wound.

307
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:39,599
What's wrong? Why hasn't it gone yet?

308
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,239
Ouch!

309
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,079
Piggy, you and I are not friends anymore.

310
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,319
Oh!

311
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:09,119
It's... an accident.

312
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,959
In fact, the wound had long healed.

313
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:18,159
But... still shows a few traces.

314
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,079
Don't pay attention to it.

315
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:08,879
What's up, Sat?

316
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,439
Nothing.

317
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:29,999
I'm just hungry.

318
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:33,319
- Are you hungry?
- Umm.

319
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:44,079
I've prepared for you, Sat, especially.

320
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,319
- Eat it.
- Eat it.

321
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,199
Umm, ah...

322
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:43,039
Oh...

323
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:58,879
It's Sat.

324
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:00,839
Umm, wipe it.

325
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,359
Messy.

326
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,679
Oh.

327
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,359
Wait!

328
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,239
I'll go now.

329
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:18,919
I'll go now.

330
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:33,959
And if you...

331
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:36,839
were to have someone..

332
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,839
What type do you want?

333
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,079
I want to start with a friend first..

334
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,479
and then continue to be a boyfriend.

335
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:22,950
Happy Valentine's Day.

336
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,239
Today you dressed very nicely.

337
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:42,919
Where are you going?

338
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,439
I'm going to eat with my someone.

339
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,479
Well, you must be gone now.

340
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:21,460
Well, bye-bye.

341
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,039
Today you dressed up very handsomely.

342
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:42,759
Where are you going?

343
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:51,959
I'm going to eat with my boyfriend.

344
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:06,919
Today is the Valentine's Day?

345
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,119
Since when and with whom?

346
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:17,879
You told me that you don't have a boyfriend.

347
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:21,799
Sat...

348
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:26,279
Well, I opened up with a forth year

349
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,039
after shutting myself for a long time.

350
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,039
And this morning...

351
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:36,439
I just agreed to be his boyfriend.

352
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:47,479
And tonight I'm going on a date with him.

353
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,039
Are you okay?

354
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:31,799
I'm fine.

355
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:45,439
I'm just happy... you found someone.

356
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:13,639
But I know you're not ready, right?

357
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:15,799
You're not ready to have a new one.

358
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:18,119
You're waiting for me, right?

359
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:23,439
If not...

360
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:26,519
then what was all the past few days?

361
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,559
Sat... Listen...

362
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:40,119
I love you!

363
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:55,799
Through past several days that you came to me...

364
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:58,799
It's just like a dream.

365
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:04,759
But now we're not kids.

366
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:09,399
We come too far to go back and change the past.

367
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:16,199
Since last seven years...

368
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:21,799
I decided to choose my own way.

369
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:25,559
Our line is parallel, Sat.

370
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:31,399
The parallel that can not be together.

371
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:34,359
You got your life that you wanted.

372
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:40,519
And now... I got P'Tor.

373
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:45,399
We're just dating.

374
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:51,959
Come to fulfill my emptiness.

375
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:56,199
Even though...it can not be substitute...

376
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:02,479
But I know... that someone...

377
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:06,079
is going to take care of me...

378
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:11,439
and it will go well.

379
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:55,119
Choke..

380
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:24,079
That Gundam?

381
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:35,319
Can we get it back? Choke.

382
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:53,999
OK.

383
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:58,359
It belongs to you.

384
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:01,799
Never to anyone else.

385
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:08,359
But you has to promise me.

386
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:10,919
that you won't leave it again.

387
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:15,959
No, no way.

388
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:19,559
I will take good care of it.

389
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:15,559
If possible,

390
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:26,519
I wish this never happened.

391
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:42,159
Well, you must go now.

392
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:56,359
Then, bye.

393
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:15,399
Good luck, Choke.

394
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:43,079
I love you.

395
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:46,039
My Gundam.

396
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:04,679
Sat, are you awake?

397
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:18,039
Choke, I love you!

398
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:28,759
Eleven year old like us shouldn't be kissing.

399
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:30,959
Who said we're too young? We're not.

400
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:33,399
Let's go. Choke. We will tutor you.

401
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:34,919
We can go to college together

402
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,599
then we can be together.

403
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:50,999
Sat...

404
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,479
Did you regret that you're not the representative of the university?

405
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:03,839
No.

406
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:08,359
I'll regret it more if I'm not your boyfriend.

407
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:21,559
You're always sweet.

408
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:35,159
Your lips are sweet.

409
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:39,079
Can I have another taste?

410
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:30,759
Sat, no more, I can't.

411
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:02,519
Happy Valentine's Day.

412
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:06,999
Please be my love... forever.

413
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:21,879
Happy Valentine's Day.

414
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:27,239
Let's stay like this forever.

415
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:51,359
Sat, still remember this Gundam?

416
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:58,159
Yes, I do.

417
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:04,519
I forgot to tell you about this Gundam.

418
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:09,319
It has my button of heart, right?

419
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:21,679
Yes, how do you know?

420
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:38,079
I... I guessed.

421
00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:48,439
Yes!

422
00:59:58,560 --> 00:59:59,719
Because of this Gundam.

423
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:02,679
There is your heart.

424
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:14,159
Sat, try press the heart button

425
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:16,279
and try to pray.

426
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:21,919
Your wish may some true.

427
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:37,719
If I can pray,

428
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:42,919
I would like to go back to the past again.

429
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:50,039
I'd like to take better care of you.

430
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:53,079
I want to love you more...

431
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:59,359
To take care of you, just like how you take care of me every day.

432
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:12,439
Sat... Listen to me.

433
01:01:15,720 --> 01:01:17,479
Even if there is a prayer..

434
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,439
that brings me back to fix the past.

435
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:25,159
I don't want you to go bask and fix it.

436
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:32,359
Because nowadays that I have you.

437
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:35,479
It's best for me.

438
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:42,199
We don't need to go back to fix anything.

439
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:45,839
Umm.

440
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:50,999
We just do our best now and in the future

441
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:53,079
is more than enough.

442
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,079
I love you.

443
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:22,079
Well, I love you too.

444
01:02:50,120 --> 01:02:52,279
So... Want one? Stress relief.

445
01:02:52,360 --> 01:02:55,599
- Oh, chewing gum!
- Shh! The teacher will hear!

446
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:58,679
Sat, for you. The toy that you want.

447
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:00,919
Huh, Choke! It's so cool.

448
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:03,959
Choke! I love Choke!

449
01:03:24,580 --> 01:03:25,620
Masuk...

450
01:03:26,540 --> 01:03:28,260
He used to have a boyfriend

451
01:03:28,740 --> 01:03:30,980
but his boyfriend was dead.

452
01:03:32,260 --> 01:03:36,180
P' Masuk. P' Tir, he's gone, brother.

453
01:03:38,300 --> 01:03:40,900
I think P' Tir didn't want you to...

454
01:03:41,220 --> 01:03:42,500
be drowning with sadness like this.

455
01:03:44,060 --> 01:03:45,620
I don't like seeing him sad.

456
01:03:48,500 --> 01:03:49,540
I want him to know...

457
01:03:51,860 --> 01:03:53,060
that he still has me.
