1
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:09,999
You want something? I'll make merit for you.

2
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,119
Thurs, you are talking to yourself.

3
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:16,220
I'm keeping a ghost.

4
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,020
A spirit came to stay with me.

5
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:29,110
Thank you for coming today guys! See you again next week.

6
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,999
Teacher Puth,

7
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:03,039
I don't understand how to use 'to'.

8
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,199
You don't need to call me a teacher.

9
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,199
Yes, P' Puth.

10
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,719
Are you flirting with me? I'm a teacher.

11
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,119
I don't like kids.

12
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,239
You're still young,

13
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,159
finish school, go to college then you think about love.

14
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,039
Okay?

15
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,039
Yes, sir.

16
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,999
Hello, Nong Joe.

17
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,239
P'Puth, why didn't you call me at all?

18
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,119
I just finished teaching.

19
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,039
Was gonna call you, Nong Joe.

20
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,079
I miss you.

21
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,959
- Me too, Nong Jumbo.
- P'Puth. P'Puth?

22
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,039
I have to go. Talk to you later.

23
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,199
Hello, P'Best.

24
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,039
Why was your phone unavailable?

25
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,079
I was talking to Mon.

26
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,079
Out to class but didn't lock the room.

27
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,719
Don't let me know you're talking to someone else.

28
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,239
I gotta go.

29
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,079
Puth?

30
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,239
Who are you talking to?

31
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,159
Just... nice people....

32
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,199
Sometimes, I wonder.

33
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,199
When will you stop flirting

34
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,079
And try to date to someone?

35
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,079
I see you keep sleeping around.

36
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:54,999
Is it fun?

37
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,079
True that.

38
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:06,079
Well, I guess it's fun.

39
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,119
No commitment. Meet when you're hungry.

40
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,359
Finished and go on separated ways.

41
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,999
Is it great?

42
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,359
What you guys don't understand?

43
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,039
You don't want to end up with anyone or still haven't found the right person?

44
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:33,119
I'm not really lucky in this department.

45
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,039
I'm like you.

46
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,999
And you!

47
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,879
Don't work too much that you forget to see.

48
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,199
Maybe

49
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:59,199
good love may be near you.

50
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,599
My soul mate hasn't been born yet.

51
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,159
Who knows?

52
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,199
You look at Tues.

53
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,039
I see him always with Ake.

54
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,079
Well, Ake, he's cute.

55
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,199
Are you hungry?

56
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,039
So tired today

57
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,039
- Puth?
- Huh?

58
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,999
Me and Sat will leave now.

59
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,999
- Oh!
- Have to go send Mon off too.

60
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:11,119
Oh, P'Tues, back too?

61
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,079
Yes.

62
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,119
Send me too.

63
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,239
Fine.

64
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:19,119
What? This is no fun. Why so hurry?

65
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,079
I'm not going. Here with you.

66
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,119
My man.

67
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,159
- No sunrise, no going home.
- I fucking love you.

68
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,399
- Teacher Sun?
- Yes, Nong Nuea.

69
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:27,839
Home.

70
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,039
It's hot.

71
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,879
Wanna go for some time, don't want to stay.

72
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,039
Don't forget, we have class tomorrow.

73
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,079
Not as free as you and Sun.

74
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,039
OK!

75
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,159
Are you going back now?

76
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,119
Yes!

77
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:21,119
You guys go, I'll take care of Puth.

78
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,119
See you.

79
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,039
Hello.

80
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,119
Kaeng.

81
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,119
Make me a glass.

82
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,239
Why are you looking at me?

83
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,199
The same?

84
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,239
I mean tonight.

85
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:35,199
That's it.

86
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,119
Love.

87
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,039
Miss.

88
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,199
Kaeng.

89
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,039
You only say the word 'miss' and 'love'

90
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:07,079
when you want sex. Aren't you tired?

91
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,199
Don't forget

92
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,199
that we

93
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,239
are not dating

94
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,159
Yes, I'll be a friend for you.

95
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,199
Puth.

96
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,999
I would like one more round.

97
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,199
Pleeeeeeease.

98
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,119
Enough!

99
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,119
But I haven't finished yet.

100
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,119
Pleeeeeeeeease.

101
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,199
Puth, this is Teacher Payu. He teaches physics and chemistry.

102
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,719
Feel good?

103
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,679
Are you in the mood to sit and work?

104
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,719
It's due tomorrow.

105
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:26,839
And that glass can't do anything to me.

106
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,679
Hey, are you that alcohol-tolerant now?

107
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:38,759
Not only alcohol-tolerant but many more.

108
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:49,919
Kaeng.

109
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:59,679
Do you think people will know about us?

110
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,839
No.

111
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,759
Friends in our group?

112
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:15,839
No one doubts, believe me.

113
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,119
- Don't think too much.
- Umm.

114
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:22,879
I'll sleep now.

115
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:28,839
Puth?

116
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,799
I'm done with my work.

117
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,879
Already asleep.

118
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:44,759
Don't forget that we are

119
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,839
not dating.

120
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,879
Puth?

121
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:22,879
Puth?

122
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,759
Wake up.

123
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,799
Nuea will come to my room.

124
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,879
He'll see you.

125
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,679
If you don't get up, it'll be another round.

126
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:58,879
Kaeng?

127
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,879
Wake up!

128
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,879
So one more round.

129
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:13,839
Pleeeeeease.

130
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,759
Enough!

131
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,799
Please?

132
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,799
5 minutes, enough?

133
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:29,839
Not enough.

134
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:02,119
Last night you didn't come back to your room.

135
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:05,839
Where did you sleep?

136
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:17,719
Well, I went to sleep with my exes.

137
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,719
Who?

138
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:24,919
Tell me.

139
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,839
No, I'm sleeping.

140
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:41,719
Puth, come here, I'll introduce you to our new tutor.

141
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:42,839
Yes, sir.

142
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:47,799
Here, Teacher Payu, freshly grad. He teaches physics with chemistry.

143
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,719
This is Puth. Teaching English, English major.

144
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,799
Yes, nice to meet you. My name is Payu.

145
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,679
I'm a new tutor, physics and chemistry.

146
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,759
Nice to know you.

147
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,839
Welcome.

148
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,879
Anyway, Puth, you take care of Payu too.

149
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,719
Ok.

150
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,799
- Okay, so if there's nothing, I'll go now.
- Yes.

151
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,919
- Hello.
- Hello.

152
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,799
Oh, Payu, thought you go back already?

153
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,759
I'm preparing teaching materials.

154
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:14,799
But this machine isn't very cooperative.

155
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:18,919
Uncle is tempered again.

156
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,879
Always like this when got lots of copying.

157
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,679
I'll take a look.

158
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,799
P'Payu, try ordering a new printing.

159
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:46,879
It can't do. It said that ink waste is full.

160
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:54,839
So... must call a technician.

161
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:59,719
I'll tell the manager tomorrow.

162
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,679
Call a technician?

163
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,759
I'm in a hurry.

164
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,919
Or there's a print shop around here?

165
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:09,879
Print shop?

166
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:15,719
There are not many print shops around here.

167
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,679
It's hard to find these days.

168
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,759
Oh... I know now.

169
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,719
I'll try to fix it another way.

170
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,839
I've seen another tutor do it.

171
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:36,839
I'll try.

172
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,839
P'Payu, try printing.

173
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,759
Are you okay?

174
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,879
You're messed up. Go wash it out.

175
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,799
What mess?

176
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,839
Here. The ink.

177
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:23,799
I'll wash my face.

178
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:29,839
So cute.

179
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:39,839
Let me see. You cleaned up?

180
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,719
It's not clean. Come here.

181
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,799
Wipe it up.

182
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,679
Finished. Handsome boy.

183
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,839
Not yet?

184
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,719
Done. Wiped clean.

185
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,759
Thank you for helping me with that.

186
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,879
If you're done, you can go home now.

187
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:38,879
So you're done and just gonna chase me away?

188
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:46,759
Not like that. If you don't want to go yet, help me staple?

189
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,879
When we're done, let's go eat together.

190
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:53,719
Considering it a thank you for helping me.

191
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,719
OK?

192
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:06,799
OK.

193
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,679
OK, deal.

194
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,679
Come.

195
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:43,719
Puth?

196
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,719
P'Puth!

197
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,879
Are you okay?

198
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,839
P'Puth!

199
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,759
What...

200
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:24,719
- I think I found that right person.
- Really?

201
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,799
It's the new tutor.

202
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,919
Payu.

203
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:36,839
A tutor?...

204
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:45,719
It's adult's business, kid, don't be bossy!

205
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,879
Just color whatever you're doing.

206
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,719
Let's go!

207
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,839
I'm not a kid

208
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,879
I slept with someone!

209
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:20,719
Kaeng.

210
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,839
Why did you call?

211
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:39,639
Can we do it, again?

212
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,879
I don't want to, I wanna sleep.

213
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:48,919
Come down.

214
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,799
Come down? What do you mean?

215
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,399
I parked at the back of your dorm.

216
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:57,719
Hurry up. Come down.

217
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:00,759
You go find your other friends.

218
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:04,719
I'm not in the mood.

219
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:12,679
Mon, take care of the milk. I go to sleep.

220
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:32,919
P' Team,

221
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,879
today I feel hot. Can I sleep with you?

222
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:42,719
Yes I'll come get you, my smile.

223
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:19,879
- Puth?
- Hey!

224
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,839
It's me.

225
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:14,759
Puth..

226
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,799
I can't!

227
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,839
I want to...

228
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,679
But you have to do as promised!

229
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,679
Ok.

230
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,839
Oh, Puth!

231
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,799
Oh...

232
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,839
P'Payu...

233
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,799
Fighting!

234
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,719
Umm...

235
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,479
Puth, you fighting too.

236
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,799
Kaeng.

237
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:24,679
was gonna invite you to a movie.

238
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,679
I don't have other friends.

239
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:30,759
Not going, I have a date with P'Payu!

240
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,839
Fine...

241
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,719
It's a no-no.

242
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,879
Don't have to scold.

243
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,879
That's it.

244
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:52,919
How's your first class? The students okay?

245
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:54,919
These students are something.

246
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,919
Always distract me so I can't teach.

247
00:32:56,920 --> 00:33:01,839
Ah... be careful with flirtatious children.

248
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:04,839
These kids...

249
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:07,839
Can't let a cute teacher out of their way.

250
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,839
And now

251
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:18,439
- daddy type is a thing.
- I guess they come on to you often too.

252
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,879
No...

253
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:24,799
I'm not that cute.

254
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:27,759
I don't believe you! From all I heard...

255
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:31,879
They were very pleased with you. Full class every time.

256
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:36,759
You don't know nothing.

257
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,799
So...

258
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,919
where you'd be going after this?

259
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:46,839
Get food... Would you like to join me?

260
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,719
Yes.

261
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:56,759
- I'll return the book first. See you.
- Then... I go with you.

262
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,799
Don't forget...

263
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,719
that we

264
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,879
aren't boyfriends!

265
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:20,719
Do you think that anyone will know

266
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,839
about us?

267
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:27,679
Heh, no, our friends?

268
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:30,839
We have to do what we promised.

269
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,839
Done, you...

270
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,919
can go.

271
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:44,759
- Do you want me to go?
- Um.

272
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,759
Give me a hug!

273
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:04,799
- I'll actually be leaving.
- Oh...

274
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:09,879
Oh Sun, I'll go back now.

275
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:13,879
Damn Puth, why so hurry!

276
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:16,719
I slept just a few hours last night.

277
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:18,799
Dog behind....

278
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:24,879
- Damn it!
- Puth, I'm sorry.

279
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:28,799
Well... Don't be dramatic.

280
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:32,679
Don't you forget what happened last night?

281
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,719
Can you shut up!

282
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,679
Do you want others to hear?

283
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,799
Wanna invite you to a movie.
There's no one else.

284
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:52,799
Not going, I have an appointment with P'Payu.

285
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,839
Are you okay? You seem delusional.

286
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:11,719
I think I have fallen in love with him!

287
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,999
What should we eat today?

288
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,119
I really like this sentence...

289
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:42,919
I want you to ask me this often.

290
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:47,879
Or...

291
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:51,039
call my name again?

292
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:57,119
Puth... If I was a kid, I'd have melted.

293
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:12,959
You always see me as a kid.

294
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,119
Aww... just kidding.

295
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:21,079
So what are we going to eat?

296
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,959
I let you choose.

297
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,119
Oh...

298
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:29,999
Today I please you. Choose.

299
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,119
I've chosen.

300
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,999
I choose to please you.

301
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:44,839
Puth! let's play a game.

302
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,039
Ok.

303
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:50,039
I like to play games.

304
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:56,079
The rule is if you don't answer, you won't score.

305
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,319
But if you answered incorrectly

306
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:03,119
- you will get only 0.5 from effort points.
- Yes!

307
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:08,999
But if you answer correctly, you will get 1 point...

308
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,119
Ok.

309
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,079
- So let's start.
- Yes.

310
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:18,959
This problem is...

311
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,079
if I throw a stone at a speed of

312
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:25,919
20 meters per second, it takes 6 seconds.

313
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,079
The question is that where would this stone

314
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:34,879
fall away from the starting point?

315
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,999
I don't know!

316
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,919
Well...

317
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,039
I did not study science.

318
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:56,999
- But no answer, no point!
- Um...

319
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:00,999
Then I answer...

320
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:05,030
- Either 0 or 1.
- Why?

321
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:10,079
a science study friend used to say that...

322
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,879
how difficult the problem is...

323
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:15,999
how much you solve the problem, in the end...

324
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:18,959
The answer will always either 0 or 1.

325
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,079
See?

326
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:25,919
You'd not write that down, up to you.

327
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:29,999
At least you scored an effort.

328
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:33,039
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

329
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,999
So if I...

330
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:44,119
tell you where we are going to have dinner.

331
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:47,959
I will get points, right?

332
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:52,079
Now, you know where we're eating?

333
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,079
I figured.

334
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,119
Let's go have a meal.

335
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,039
Ok...

336
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,079
P'Payu...

337
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,119
Thank you for today.

338
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,999
I've learn a lot

339
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:22,959
but...

340
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,079
I want something.

341
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,079
Can I have your number?

342
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,999
You said that today I gave you a lot

343
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:52,119
so the number

344
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,919
is for next time.

345
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,119
Yes...

346
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,999
Kaeng: Hey, anyone interested to go to a new store with me?

347
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:14,070
Nuea: We won't go. Teacher Sun doesn't let me go.

348
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:15,959
Kaeng: Team? Mon? Puth?

349
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,999
Team: Nong Mon? Can I go?

350
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,039
Mon: You can go.

351
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:23,870
Mon: But tomorrow's movie date will be canceled.

352
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,119
Team: Uh, I won't go today, it's ok.

353
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,999
Team: Kaeng, it's clear, I'm not going.

354
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:29,999
Kaeng: Uh, so clear, crystal.

355
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,999
Kaeng: Puth, why didn't you answer? Ask Puth for me.

356
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,039
P'Puth!

357
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,879
- P'Puth?
- Well...

358
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,919
Answer P'Kaeng please.

359
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:49,919
Yes...

360
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:54,959
Puth: Won't go.

361
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,879
You ok?

362
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:06,879
Seem delusional lately.

363
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:15,999
I think...

364
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:18,959
I fell in love with him.

365
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:20,999
Who?

366
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:24,959
- The tutor!
- And then...

367
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,079
Do you think you can get him?

368
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:30,039
I think it's difficult.

369
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:34,119
He doesn't believe me.

370
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:39,959
Come on...

371
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,959
I am rooting for you.

372
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,959
Fighting.

373
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:01,999
But I have a boyfriend!

374
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:05,919
Oh... I know!

375
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:07,919
Show off!

376
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:11,879
At least I'd get someone...

377
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:35,079
Team? Mon?
- What?

378
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:36,999
Since you are dating,

379
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,919
you're never far apart.

380
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:43,719
- Love bird.
- Oh, you are no different from him.

381
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:46,999
- Haven't seen you for so long.
- You two were never apart.

382
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:48,879
What!

383
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:52,990
- Hey, where are you? You will pay.
- I'm right here...

384
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:57,839
- Teacher Sun, lunch together?
- Yes.

385
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:01,039
It hurts...

386
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,959
- Hi, Kaeng.
- Hi.

387
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:16,079
Damn Puth!
- Huh...

388
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:18,079
You're surprised?

389
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:21,119
What surprise?

390
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:24,039
I saw...

391
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:39,999
Mute.

392
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,119
Am I cute? With glasses like this.

393
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:51,999
So so.

394
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:54,030
Want some tonight? I'm free.

395
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:56,950
But I'm busy.

396
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:01,919
With me that often, ever get bored? You can go find some other people.

397
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:03,999
They are not as good as you. Where you going?

398
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:06,119
No date. Just tired. Not horny, understand?

399
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:20,879
Come to me. Don't want to do me with this look?

400
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:36,959
Talk later.

401
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:41,879
- Sure, very sure.
- Right.

402
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:43,079
- Tell you, it's a 100 percent.
- Yes.

403
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:45,039
-Yes, I'm sure.

404
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:46,879
Kaeng!

405
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:47,959
Damn Puth!

406
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:49,999
Are you secretly dating?

407
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:57,079
Say what? I talked to my student. - Really? Is it right?

408
00:45:57,120 --> 00:46:00,879
-I think ...
- I thought too.

409
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:04,959
- Talking to my friend, submitting a paper. - Hey, so hot...

410
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,959
Liar, going to hell...

411
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,959
Dating? What the fuck? We didn't.

412
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,959
Huh, sure, upset.

413
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:14,959
- Suspicious...
- Bye...

414
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:16,959
- Oh, P'Puth!
- Bye...

415
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:18,959
Oh...

416
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,039
Kaeng...

417
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:18,879
I guess I'm going to be in love.

418
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:22,039
I really want to be serious about him.
