1
00:01:30,167 --> 00:01:31,124
Mon,

2
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:35,166
can I go in to talk to you?

3
00:01:38,208 --> 00:01:39,499
Team, don't come in just yet.

4
00:01:43,208 --> 00:01:44,291
I just want to be alone.

5
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:53,582
Then, can I just stand next to you.

6
00:02:15,167 --> 00:02:17,166
I understand

7
00:02:19,208 --> 00:02:22,124
what you're going through..

8
00:02:30,125 --> 00:02:31,124
Mon?

9
00:02:37,208 --> 00:02:40,124
I'm sorry that I just kissed you.

10
00:02:41,167 --> 00:02:42,541
I was really into the character.

11
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:48,207
It's okay.

12
00:02:53,167 --> 00:02:55,082
I understand that it was all an act.

13
00:03:02,167 --> 00:03:03,291
So...

14
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:09,166
you never kiss?

15
00:03:24,292 --> 00:03:29,166
You don't have to answer me. Just curious.

16
00:03:30,167 --> 00:03:32,207
Um, I'll going back.

17
00:03:45,167 --> 00:03:47,207
Damn... Okay, I'll be fast.

18
00:03:47,292 --> 00:03:49,249
You have to give me a thousand. Okay?

19
00:03:51,167 --> 00:03:52,166
Mon,

20
00:03:53,208 --> 00:03:57,166
I'm sorry, I'll have to go now. Duty calls.

21
00:03:58,167 --> 00:03:59,166
I'm sorry.

22
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:00,249
You're going now?

23
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:04,082
I have to hurry.

24
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:05,332
You can go back by yourself?

25
00:04:09,167 --> 00:04:10,166
- Well, bye.
- Um.

26
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:13,082
Later.

27
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:14,166
Goodbye.

28
00:04:30,167 --> 00:04:33,166
Mon, can I sit with you?

29
00:04:33,208 --> 00:04:34,249
That table is full.

30
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:53,166
Team, give it to me.

31
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:11,082
What do you want?

32
00:05:11,167 --> 00:05:14,166
- Thin rice noodle.
- Okay, please wait.

33
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:43,124
Team,

34
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:49,166
Enough. Quit playing now.

35
00:05:50,292 --> 00:05:53,166
- Your noodle.
- Thank you.

36
00:05:58,167 --> 00:06:01,249
Do you like to eat thin rice noodle?

37
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:08,291
I like it too.

38
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:10,166
What a coincidence!

39
00:06:10,292 --> 00:06:13,124
Coincidence like how you came here, right?

40
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:16,291
You know too much.

41
00:06:21,167 --> 00:06:22,166
Give me a little smile.

42
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:27,082
Nope.

43
00:06:48,292 --> 00:06:50,207
You eat messily like a kid.

44
00:06:51,167 --> 00:06:52,166
You're messed up.

45
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:02,082
Here!

46
00:07:25,167 --> 00:07:26,249
Cute?

47
00:07:28,167 --> 00:07:29,166
Not really.

48
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:41,166
I give you...

49
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:55,249
Meatball is most delicious. Why did you give me?

50
00:07:56,167 --> 00:08:00,124
How about you? Are you delicious?

51
00:08:18,167 --> 00:08:19,166
Team..

52
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:28,124
After this, where are you going next?

53
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:31,291
- Oh, back to the dorm.
- Go back to the dormitory.

54
00:08:33,167 --> 00:08:34,457
- Dorm will be closed.
- Dorm will close soon.

55
00:08:35,292 --> 00:08:36,291
Team?

56
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:38,207
I always give you the same answer.

57
00:08:42,083 --> 00:08:43,166
Then

58
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:48,082
Can I send you off?

59
00:08:49,167 --> 00:08:51,082
Send off?

60
00:08:52,167 --> 00:08:54,124
I will go see a friend, too.

61
00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:56,207
Oh..

62
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:20,249
Hurry and eat, so we can go back soon.

63
00:09:47,542 --> 00:09:49,207
- Team?
- Yes.

64
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:52,249
We're here.

65
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:58,166
Oh, arrived.

66
00:10:03,292 --> 00:10:07,082
Thank you very much.

67
00:10:07,167 --> 00:10:08,166
Yes.

68
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:11,166
See you tomorrow.

69
00:10:12,292 --> 00:10:13,207
Yes.

70
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:20,166
Mon, can I have your ID?

71
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:45,124
Here it is.

72
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:51,207
See you tomorrow.

73
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:54,249
Yes.

74
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:58,207
Mon.

75
00:10:59,167 --> 00:11:00,207
Good night.

76
00:11:17,292 --> 00:11:23,166
Today, Team secretly kissed Mon, P'Kang.

77
00:11:29,167 --> 00:11:30,166
Mon?

78
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:32,207
Call me back

79
00:11:32,292 --> 00:11:33,291
this number?

80
00:11:57,125 --> 00:11:58,207
Mon?

81
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:01,082
Yes, sir.

82
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:04,124
Is the ring tone cute?

83
00:12:04,167 --> 00:12:06,124
I set it up for the you.

84
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:11,249
Next time, take me to the temple with you. I promised that I would wake up in time.

85
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:13,582
As for tonight, have a good dream.

86
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:19,207
Good night, P' Team.

87
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:33,291
P'Kang, P'Team is so cute.

88
00:12:41,167 --> 00:12:45,124
How's that kid? Are you finished with him?

89
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:48,166
Calm down, I'm not that horny.

90
00:12:49,167 --> 00:12:51,124
And..

91
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:54,207
I feel something about him.

92
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:56,124
What something?

93
00:12:56,208 --> 00:13:00,166
I feel that he is different from others.

94
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:05,082
And today I accidentally kissed him.

95
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:06,166
Huh?

96
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:08,082
Kiss.

97
00:13:08,167 --> 00:13:09,166
Yes!

98
00:13:09,292 --> 00:13:10,374
Don't you have no kiss policy?

99
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:12,166
Um.

100
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:16,207
The last time you kissed... it's your ex.

101
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:18,082
Yes!

102
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:20,207
No need to repeat that.

103
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:22,249
Don't tell me

104
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:25,166
you accidentally love that kid.

105
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:28,082
Not yet, not yet.

106
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:29,249
Oh well.

107
00:13:30,292 --> 00:13:32,166
It's against the rules of our group.

108
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:35,124
Nuea was out,

109
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:37,207
Don't tell me it's you now.

110
00:13:39,292 --> 00:13:40,166
Yes!

111
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:45,082
Cheers!

112
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:53,207
Don't forget, you have three days left.

113
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:57,166
If you don't succeed, you lose.

114
00:13:58,167 --> 00:13:59,082
I know.

115
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:00,166
Just make it done.

116
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:08,207
P' Team?

117
00:15:09,167 --> 00:15:11,166
I bought medicine and food for you.

118
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:39,166
Come in first.

119
00:16:22,167 --> 00:16:24,207
How are you?

120
00:16:25,167 --> 00:16:28,249
Nong Mon, feel me yourself

121
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:31,124
see if I was better?

122
00:16:36,167 --> 00:16:37,166
Well....

123
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:44,207
The body has cooled down, should be better.

124
00:16:54,208 --> 00:16:58,207
But before you came, I was running fever.

125
00:16:59,167 --> 00:17:02,249
When you came, I got better.

126
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,207
I'm having a cold.

127
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:50,166
I'm ready to catch a cold.

128
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:21,124
Mon,

129
00:20:21,292 --> 00:20:22,207
let me

130
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:27,166
go to study.

131
00:20:31,167 --> 00:20:32,249
Study hard!

132
00:20:37,167 --> 00:20:38,082
Yes.

133
00:21:55,292 --> 00:21:56,207
P’ Team..

134
00:22:04,292 --> 00:22:07,166
True love doesn't happen overnight.

135
00:22:10,125 --> 00:22:12,207
You're not worthy for my friends.

136
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,124
It's over.

137
00:22:16,125 --> 00:22:17,249
I am like all of his ex.

138
00:22:32,458 --> 00:22:33,416
Team.

139
00:22:50,292 --> 00:22:52,332
Oh, Kaeng.

140
00:23:16,417 --> 00:23:17,457
Hello, Kaeng.

141
00:23:18,458 --> 00:23:20,374
Want to tidy yourself up first?

142
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:33,416
Come see Team? He's out to study.

143
00:23:34,333 --> 00:23:35,374
I didn't come to see him.

144
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:37,416
came see you.

145
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:47,582
I don't want to say this but it's happened before.

146
00:23:48,333 --> 00:23:53,416
You're freshman, may not know much about uni life.

147
00:23:54,333 --> 00:23:59,374
Some people you've met may not be like they want you to see.

148
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:04,291
They can say one thing but think another.

149
00:24:06,458 --> 00:24:09,416
True love doesn't happen overnight.

150
00:24:10,458 --> 00:24:11,832
Do you understand what I said?

151
00:24:15,417 --> 00:24:20,541
I don't understand. Just say it to me.

152
00:24:21,458 --> 00:24:26,457
Now Team is at my room, he wants me to tell you that

153
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:30,499
all the things, including last night,

154
00:24:31,333 --> 00:24:34,332
he doesn't want you to think or feel more than what it is.

155
00:26:11,458 --> 00:26:18,416
Tell him that I will not think and feel more..

156
00:26:20,375 --> 00:26:21,416
than what it is.

157
00:26:23,417 --> 00:26:25,416
It will not happen again.

158
00:26:26,333 --> 00:26:28,374
He didn't have to take any responsibility for me.

159
00:26:28,458 --> 00:26:30,416
I am responsible for my own feelings.

160
00:27:17,375 --> 00:27:19,499
Mon, are you okay?

161
00:27:21,333 --> 00:27:23,457
No, man. It's over.

162
00:27:25,292 --> 00:27:26,707
I was like everyone of his toys.

163
00:27:33,417 --> 00:27:36,332
No, don't be sad.

164
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:49,332
Mon,

165
00:27:54,375 --> 00:27:55,332
I'm not going anymore.

166
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:58,457
I think I will resign from the club.

167
00:27:59,458 --> 00:28:00,374
Why?

168
00:28:01,417 --> 00:28:02,457
Please tell him.

169
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,291
Because of Team, right?

170
00:28:07,583 --> 00:28:08,416
Third?

171
00:28:14,458 --> 00:28:15,416
It's alright.

172
00:28:18,542 --> 00:28:23,416
Hey! Don't be sad, I am here for you.

173
00:28:24,375 --> 00:28:26,291
Ruth and I are here.

174
00:30:25,458 --> 00:30:26,416
Hey,

175
00:30:31,292 --> 00:30:32,291
that

176
00:30:32,333 --> 00:30:34,374
friend of yours, Mon, no show?

177
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:36,457
I haven't seen him for many days now.

178
00:30:36,458 --> 00:30:41,291
Don't ask me or I'll use black magic to get buffalo skin inside your stomach.

179
00:30:48,458 --> 00:30:49,707
I've made a mistake with him.

180
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:52,499
I want to apologize to him.

181
00:30:53,333 --> 00:30:54,374
Why are you sorry now?

182
00:30:55,333 --> 00:30:58,582
People's feeling can't be fixed easily like a wooden scene.

183
00:30:59,417 --> 00:31:00,499
Don't you make a sad face.

184
00:31:01,542 --> 00:31:03,457
Though my friend is just a setting crew,

185
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:08,416
that he may seem low in your eyes,

186
00:31:09,292 --> 00:31:12,457
his heart is more humane than yours.

187
00:31:13,542 --> 00:31:17,374
Bro, you're not worthy for my friend.

188
00:31:19,458 --> 00:31:23,374
Please go break other people's soul,

189
00:31:24,458 --> 00:31:28,291
but not my friend's. Or I'll crack your face.

190
00:31:52,375 --> 00:31:53,291
I love him.

191
00:31:56,333 --> 00:32:01,332
There is only a kiss of true love that could wake the prince up.

192
00:32:35,625 --> 00:32:36,541
Kaeng,

193
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:42,582
what did you go there for?

194
00:32:43,583 --> 00:32:44,749
What did you say to him?

195
00:32:45,625 --> 00:32:49,374
Just tell him what we tell your other ex.

196
00:32:49,625 --> 00:32:50,749
Why?

197
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:08,499
What the fuck is wrong with you?

198
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,541
You better tell me?

199
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:21,541
Don't tell me..

200
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:24,666
you love him.

201
00:33:26,667 --> 00:33:27,707
Hmm?

202
00:33:28,667 --> 00:33:29,707
Yes!

203
00:33:31,708 --> 00:33:33,541
I love him.

204
00:33:59,708 --> 00:34:03,541
Welcome to voice mail service.

205
00:34:03,542 --> 00:34:07,624
Please record your message after the tone.

206
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:27,582
What are you doing here?

207
00:36:27,625 --> 00:36:29,541
Mon...

208
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,666
Are you really not going to the theater?

209
00:36:32,708 --> 00:36:34,749
This is the last show.

210
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:38,624
We've been helping each other.

211
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:40,666
Let's go, Mon.

212
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,707
Even I don't like it, I go.

213
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:50,749
I don't want to go.

214
00:36:51,625 --> 00:36:52,707
Go ahead.

215
00:36:59,583 --> 00:37:00,666
Mon,

216
00:37:01,542 --> 00:37:02,666
I know

217
00:37:02,708 --> 00:37:04,624
the reason you don't want to go.

218
00:37:04,667 --> 00:37:07,499
Because you don't want to meet him, right?!

219
00:37:07,542 --> 00:37:11,541
But this time, Team doesn't play.

220
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:14,666
There are two main actors.

221
00:37:16,625 --> 00:37:18,541
This time is Kong.

222
00:37:18,667 --> 00:37:20,624
Let's go.

223
00:37:21,708 --> 00:37:23,582
No.

224
00:37:24,583 --> 00:37:26,624
Whoever plays, I don't go.

225
00:37:27,542 --> 00:37:28,707
Please.

226
00:37:35,542 --> 00:37:36,624
Come with us.

227
00:37:37,042 --> 00:37:38,707
You made the show too!

228
00:37:50,833 --> 00:37:53,499
Walk faster.

229
00:37:54,708 --> 00:37:56,749
Oh.

230
00:37:58,708 --> 00:38:02,541
Seriously, watching from here is good, It's private.

231
00:38:02,542 --> 00:38:04,582
There is no one else around. Look.

232
00:38:06,583 --> 00:38:08,582
Walk faster.

233
00:38:08,583 --> 00:38:10,624
Cheer up, Mon.

234
00:38:10,667 --> 00:38:12,749
- P' Puth, come!
- Umm...

235
00:38:13,583 --> 00:38:17,749
Here! I prepared a special seat for you.

236
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:21,582
Here, here, here. Sit. P’ Puth came.

237
00:38:21,708 --> 00:38:23,749
Sit now.

238
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:26,499
P'Puth come to my side.

239
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:38,666
Why no audience?

240
00:38:38,667 --> 00:38:40,541
Oh, don't you know?

241
00:38:40,542 --> 00:38:43,624
We organize an online live stage musical.

242
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:10,624
Hello, Nong Nuea.

243
00:39:10,667 --> 00:39:12,582
Hello, P' Puth.

244
00:39:13,583 --> 00:39:14,707
Hello, P' Sun.

245
00:39:14,708 --> 00:39:16,749
Hello.

246
00:39:22,542 --> 00:39:23,624
Puth.

247
00:39:23,625 --> 00:39:25,582
We haven't talk about it yet.

248
00:39:25,583 --> 00:39:26,624
Oh!

249
00:39:26,667 --> 00:39:28,749
But don't you got a boyfriend?

250
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:32,624
You shut it.

251
00:39:32,667 --> 00:39:33,707
Teacher P' Sun?

252
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:35,666
Yes, Nong Nuea?

253
00:39:35,708 --> 00:39:38,666
Oh... love birds.

254
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:41,749
Let's go, Teacher Sun. I'm sore.

255
00:39:42,667 --> 00:39:44,499
Ok.

256
00:39:44,583 --> 00:39:48,499
- You'll pay!
- Come cash it soon.

257
00:39:48,583 --> 00:39:50,666
Next time, there's no Sun.

258
00:39:51,667 --> 00:39:54,582
Let's go sit together.

259
00:40:04,667 --> 00:40:07,541
I'll hold it for you.

260
00:40:11,625 --> 00:40:13,707
Teacher Sun, do you know these two?

261
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:15,749
Ruth's minions.

262
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:19,499
- What's wrong, Nong Nuea?
- Nothing.

263
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:20,707
Just felt that..

264
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:23,707
today's show will definitely be fun.

265
00:40:24,583 --> 00:40:26,624
It will definitely be fun.

266
00:40:27,625 --> 00:40:30,541
- Right here.
- Yes.

267
00:40:34,667 --> 00:40:36,582
Hello.

268
00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:39,624
Can I go in?
- Yes.

269
00:40:42,667 --> 00:40:44,666
- Ouch!
- Sorry.

270
00:40:53,583 --> 00:40:55,582
Go back to your place, Kaeng.

271
00:41:07,667 --> 00:41:09,749
- Thurs!
- Huh?

272
00:41:10,583 --> 00:41:12,499
Are you sure

273
00:41:12,625 --> 00:41:16,499
that this won't be Team?
- Yes.

274
00:41:17,542 --> 00:41:18,624
If he's playing...

275
00:41:18,625 --> 00:41:21,582
You... just don't see him as Team,

276
00:41:21,583 --> 00:41:24,541
see him as a character.

277
00:41:46,667 --> 00:41:48,624
Prince..

278
00:41:51,625 --> 00:41:54,624
What can I do to wake the prince up?

279
00:41:54,708 --> 00:41:57,541
Anyone, please tell me.

280
00:41:59,542 --> 00:42:02,541
There is only a kiss of true love

281
00:42:02,583 --> 00:42:04,749
that could revive the prince.

282
00:42:05,542 --> 00:42:07,666
If the princess is his* true lore,

283
00:42:07,708 --> 00:42:09,666
when you kiss

284
00:42:09,708 --> 00:42:12,666
the Prince will rise again.

285
00:42:12,667 --> 00:42:14,499
Okay.

286
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,499
For the prince, I will do it.

287
00:42:50,583 --> 00:42:53,541
The princess is not the Prince's true love

288
00:42:53,583 --> 00:42:54,666
whereas

289
00:42:54,750 --> 00:42:59,707
the Prince's true love is probably not far from here.

290
00:43:00,583 --> 00:43:02,582
Still have to find that person.

291
00:43:49,708 --> 00:43:51,541
Come in, please.

292
00:43:53,708 --> 00:43:55,541
Go!

293
00:43:55,625 --> 00:43:58,499
- You go.
- No!

294
00:43:59,625 --> 00:44:00,666
Mon.

295
00:44:00,667 --> 00:44:05,749
Help me, if you won't, my show won't end!

296
00:44:06,625 --> 00:44:09,582
- Please.
- Wish me luck, soldier.

297
00:44:09,625 --> 00:44:10,707
Go!

298
00:44:54,708 --> 00:44:57,624
Inviting the true, love of the Prince

299
00:44:57,792 --> 00:44:59,707
to kiss the prince.

300
00:45:33,708 --> 00:45:35,666
Give me another chance.

301
00:45:35,667 --> 00:45:38,749
I love you.

302
00:45:38,750 --> 00:45:40,666
- I miss you.
- Hey, what is this?

303
00:45:41,542 --> 00:45:43,541
- What's wrong, Team?
- Oh no.

304
00:45:43,646 --> 00:45:44,580
P'Team.

305
00:45:44,667 --> 00:45:48,499
- I'm sorry.
- Why did you hug and kiss him?

306
00:46:04,625 --> 00:46:06,791
Please welcome the true love of the Prince.

307
00:46:07,125 --> 00:46:08,832
You can kiss the Prince,

308
00:48:14,750 --> 00:48:16,707
now.

309
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:19,666
The prince has found his true love.

310
00:49:17,667 --> 00:49:18,749
Young Mon,

311
00:49:19,792 --> 00:49:21,874
I won't let you anywhere again.

312
00:49:22,750 --> 00:49:24,666
I love you.

313
00:49:31,625 --> 00:49:33,624
You don't love me anymore?

314
00:49:44,792 --> 00:49:46,666
I don't love you anymore.

315
00:49:52,708 --> 00:49:54,707
If you don't really love me,

316
00:49:55,792 --> 00:50:00,624
why are you hiding your face?

317
00:50:18,667 --> 00:50:19,874
I did not.

318
00:50:20,792 --> 00:50:22,832
I am not sorry, too.

319
00:50:23,667 --> 00:50:25,707
I just don't want to

320
00:50:26,625 --> 00:50:28,749
think or feel

321
00:50:28,875 --> 00:50:32,874
more than I suppose to.

322
00:50:37,750 --> 00:50:39,624
Mon,

323
00:50:41,875 --> 00:50:43,791
but my thought

324
00:50:44,792 --> 00:50:46,874
and my feeling are

325
00:50:49,708 --> 00:50:51,791
more than what happened that night.

326
00:50:54,667 --> 00:50:56,666
Everything that I did,

327
00:50:56,875 --> 00:50:59,624
everything I said,

328
00:51:02,667 --> 00:51:05,707
it came out from my true feelings.

329
00:51:13,708 --> 00:51:15,874
Can you give me a last chance?

330
00:51:18,833 --> 00:51:20,749
Mon, I love you.

331
00:51:22,625 --> 00:51:23,707
I promise

332
00:51:24,083 --> 00:51:26,749
that I won't hurt you again.

333
00:51:30,625 --> 00:51:31,832
Mon, I haven't feel like this

334
00:51:34,750 --> 00:51:39,666
with someone for a long time.

335
00:51:40,750 --> 00:51:42,749
What I said,

336
00:51:43,625 --> 00:51:44,791
What I did,

337
00:51:47,750 --> 00:51:49,832
it's from my heart.

338
00:51:50,667 --> 00:51:52,791
Give me another chance.

339
00:51:53,708 --> 00:51:54,832
I love you.

340
00:51:58,750 --> 00:52:00,749
Do you wanna be my boyfriend?

341
00:52:09,833 --> 00:52:11,707
Would you?

342
00:52:21,625 --> 00:52:23,624
That's it. P’ Team.

343
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:53,624
Your name is Mon, right?

344
00:52:57,875 --> 00:52:59,874
Don't be afraid.

345
00:53:01,750 --> 00:53:04,666
Abracadabra... you're good.

346
00:53:07,750 --> 00:53:09,749
What a mess, you eat like a kid.

347
00:53:09,833 --> 00:53:11,707
I give you...

348
00:53:13,875 --> 00:53:17,874
What other people think, I don't care.

349
00:53:17,875 --> 00:53:21,791
Just you not to think like them is enough.

350
00:54:00,792 --> 00:54:02,624
For real?

351
00:54:05,667 --> 00:54:07,874
Or I will definitely kill you.

352
00:55:40,833 --> 00:55:42,791
That smile..

353
00:55:43,792 --> 00:55:45,666
I brought you some water.

354
00:55:47,625 --> 00:55:49,624
Thank you, Prince..

355
00:55:56,792 --> 00:55:58,749
Have you finished your homework, babe?

356
00:55:58,750 --> 00:55:59,874
I'm sleepy already.

357
00:56:00,667 --> 00:56:01,791
Almost finished.

358
00:56:01,833 --> 00:56:03,791
P’ Team can go to bed first.

359
00:56:03,792 --> 00:56:05,666
I'll follow you.

360
00:56:09,792 --> 00:56:11,666
No.

361
00:56:11,750 --> 00:56:14,749
If I go to bed first, I'll fall asleep.

362
00:56:15,667 --> 00:56:17,791
Then I'll can't hug you.

363
00:56:23,667 --> 00:56:26,749
So... just a moment then. Almost done.

364
00:56:27,625 --> 00:56:28,707
Ok.

365
00:56:46,625 --> 00:56:48,624
Must be Kaeng.

366
00:56:48,750 --> 00:56:51,791
I will go and open for him.

367
00:57:06,708 --> 00:57:09,624
- Team... I miss you.
- Hey, what is this??

368
00:57:09,708 --> 00:57:11,791
- What's the matter with you, Team?
- Oh no.

369
00:57:12,708 --> 00:57:14,791
Team... like before.

370
00:57:14,792 --> 00:57:16,749
Before? What?
- P' Team...

371
00:57:26,667 --> 00:57:27,791
What is this?

372
00:57:29,667 --> 00:57:31,707
I thought you have changed.

373
00:57:35,875 --> 00:57:37,666
Get out..

374
00:57:39,750 --> 00:57:40,749
Mon..

375
00:57:45,750 --> 00:57:46,749
Nong Mon...

376
00:57:46,792 --> 00:57:48,666
Please listen to me.

377
00:57:49,875 --> 00:57:51,874
Go out, Team.

378
00:57:52,792 --> 00:57:55,624
I don't want to hear from you anymore.

379
00:57:55,875 --> 00:57:57,791
We all know..

380
00:57:57,875 --> 00:57:59,874
that me and him..

381
00:58:02,667 --> 00:58:04,666
We used to sleep together

382
00:58:07,625 --> 00:58:09,666
but since I got to know you

383
00:58:09,708 --> 00:58:11,832
I have never did any bad habit.

384
00:58:12,667 --> 00:58:13,832
We are human,

385
00:58:15,625 --> 00:58:17,624
There must be some past.

386
00:58:17,792 --> 00:58:19,791
I love you,

387
00:58:20,625 --> 00:58:22,749
and if I make you sad,

388
00:58:22,833 --> 00:58:24,791
I'm sorry.

389
00:58:25,750 --> 00:58:28,666
So why did you hug and kiss him?

390
00:58:28,750 --> 00:58:30,749
Mon, try think it through

391
00:58:30,875 --> 00:58:32,749
if I had hugged

392
00:58:33,708 --> 00:58:35,624
or kissed him?

393
00:58:37,792 --> 00:58:39,707
I just standing still.

394
00:58:44,625 --> 00:58:45,749
I don't know

395
00:58:51,667 --> 00:58:54,666
Then... I will move away.

396
00:58:54,750 --> 00:58:55,874
Change my number.

397
00:58:55,875 --> 00:58:58,749
So no one can contact me, is it good?

398
00:58:58,792 --> 00:59:01,666
What you going to do is not my problem.

399
00:59:01,708 --> 00:59:03,832
I don't want to care about you anymore.

400
00:59:05,667 --> 00:59:08,832
You never make me feel confident in you.

401
00:59:13,667 --> 00:59:15,832
I don't want to lose you.

402
00:59:16,667 --> 00:59:18,707
Turn to me.

403
00:59:23,833 --> 00:59:27,707
If you don't, it's okay

404
00:59:27,833 --> 00:59:29,791
but you have one thing

405
00:59:30,750 --> 00:59:32,749
that I want you to hear.

406
00:59:38,708 --> 00:59:39,791
Mom,

407
00:59:40,667 --> 00:59:42,749
do you remember Mon?

408
00:59:43,708 --> 00:59:45,707
The one I used to tell you about.

409
00:59:45,792 --> 00:59:47,791
The lovely guy.

410
00:59:47,833 --> 00:59:49,791
Good boy.

411
00:59:50,625 --> 00:59:54,624
The one who invited me to the temple when I feel down.

412
00:59:54,708 --> 00:59:55,874
I remember him.

413
00:59:55,875 --> 00:59:58,749
The junior, communication arts student.

414
00:59:58,750 --> 01:00:01,666
You always said he is nice and good.

415
01:00:01,708 --> 01:00:05,707
And who likes to forget to release the smoke at stage rehearsal.

416
01:00:05,750 --> 01:00:08,707
That you often told me about.
- Yes.

417
01:00:08,750 --> 01:00:11,624
And... Mother, do you remember?

418
01:00:11,708 --> 01:00:13,666
The mother used to tell the team that

419
01:00:14,708 --> 01:00:15,874
If I have someone special,

420
01:00:16,667 --> 01:00:18,707
I must first tell you first.

421
01:00:19,792 --> 01:00:21,791
I remember, baby.

422
01:00:23,708 --> 01:00:25,707
I have found him.

423
01:00:25,875 --> 01:00:28,666
Mon, that's him, mom.

424
01:00:35,708 --> 01:00:36,832
Now,

425
01:00:37,875 --> 01:00:40,749
Me and Nong Mon are in a relationship.

426
01:00:40,833 --> 01:00:44,666
And... now he is here too.

427
01:00:45,708 --> 01:00:47,791
Mother, can you talk to him?

428
01:00:47,875 --> 01:00:49,707
Ok, baby.

429
01:00:57,708 --> 01:00:59,707
Talk to my mother.

430
01:01:00,792 --> 01:01:02,791
Please, my smile.

431
01:01:05,833 --> 01:01:07,707
Thank you.

432
01:01:10,750 --> 01:01:13,624
I'll carry you up to sit there.

433
01:01:30,833 --> 01:01:32,874
Talk to my mother.

434
01:01:39,792 --> 01:01:40,874
Mom, sir.

435
01:01:42,667 --> 01:01:44,874
- Hello, Mom.
- Hello.

436
01:01:45,667 --> 01:01:46,832
Cute face.

437
01:01:47,625 --> 01:01:49,707
Seems to be really nice.

438
01:01:50,833 --> 01:01:53,707
Please take care of my baby.

439
01:01:53,792 --> 01:01:57,791
He's always called to tell me about you.

440
01:01:57,875 --> 01:01:59,707
Be together,

441
01:01:59,792 --> 01:02:01,874
and love each other everyday, baby.

442
01:02:02,667 --> 01:02:03,791
Mom is far away..

443
01:02:04,667 --> 01:02:06,666
If I return to Thailand,

444
01:02:06,750 --> 01:02:08,791
we got to eat together.

445
01:02:10,792 --> 01:02:12,749
Ok, mom.

446
01:02:13,750 --> 01:02:15,749
See you then.

447
01:02:17,708 --> 01:02:18,791
Yes, sir.

448
01:02:21,875 --> 01:02:23,791
Talk later, Mom.

449
01:02:24,667 --> 01:02:25,707
I love you, mom.

450
01:02:25,708 --> 01:02:27,707
Love you!

451
01:02:34,833 --> 01:02:37,791
Not mad anymore right?

452
01:02:39,625 --> 01:02:40,791
Yes.

453
01:02:40,875 --> 01:02:42,749
Thank you

454
01:02:44,625 --> 01:02:45,791
for believing in me.

455
01:02:48,792 --> 01:02:50,666
Now

456
01:02:51,667 --> 01:02:54,832
my mom knew that we are dating

457
01:02:54,833 --> 01:02:59,791
And she'd probably the first one

458
01:03:00,792 --> 01:03:02,707
and the only one

459
01:03:02,833 --> 01:03:05,749
That I will tell

460
01:03:05,875 --> 01:03:08,749
That you are my lover.

461
01:03:11,708 --> 01:03:13,666
Stop crying now.

462
01:03:18,875 --> 01:03:20,791
I promise you

463
01:03:22,833 --> 01:03:26,707
that I will make every day the best for us.

464
01:03:29,750 --> 01:03:33,707
And... no matter what the future holds

465
01:03:36,667 --> 01:03:38,666
I will not regret a thing.

466
01:03:39,708 --> 01:03:42,874
Because the two of us have done our best.

467
01:03:45,667 --> 01:03:47,624
I love you.

468
01:03:47,750 --> 01:03:49,666
I love you too

469
01:03:51,708 --> 01:03:53,666
my Prince.

470
01:03:59,833 --> 01:04:01,791
Can you promise me

471
01:04:02,792 --> 01:04:05,707
That your smile.

472
01:04:06,708 --> 01:04:09,666
will forever belong to this price.

473
01:04:12,667 --> 01:04:13,874
Thank you.
