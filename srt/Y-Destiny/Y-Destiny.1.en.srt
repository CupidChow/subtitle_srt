1
00:01:18,625 --> 00:01:19,499
Mon, me first

2
00:01:19,833 --> 00:01:21,041
Puth!!

3
00:01:55,750 --> 00:02:01,540
Hey, are you guys ready for the first day of the 2nd semester?

4
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:07,457
Ready? You don't even iron your shirt, Sun.

5
00:02:08,833 --> 00:02:11,082
Right. Sun, you didn't iron your shirt.

6
00:02:12,083 --> 00:02:13,082
So. what's problem with it?

7
00:02:14,042 --> 00:02:15,082
- What's problem?
- Dirty!

8
00:02:16,417 --> 00:02:17,082
Just you wait!

9
00:02:18,667 --> 00:02:22,082
Hey, be serious. Are you ready for the first day of this semester?

10
00:02:25,458 --> 00:02:27,624
This semester we must not be single.

11
00:02:28,083 --> 00:02:29,624
Yes!

12
00:02:33,167 --> 00:02:36,416
If y'all are ready, let's go.

13
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,124
-Let's go!
-Go!

14
00:03:30,667 --> 00:03:32,666
You jab. Left jab, right jab. and then bob and weave.

15
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:35,740
- And you, keep doing footwork, okay?
- Okay?

16
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:37,499
You can make it Focus.

17
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:29,624
- Six seven, eight, nine ten
- Good, good good

18
00:04:53,625 --> 00:05:00,666
Tue, I think you should take a break for a while.

19
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:05,249
If you keep doing this, you won't being around for long.

20
00:05:12,542 --> 00:05:13,749
Here, your payment

21
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:24,207
Actually, I think I'll take a break

22
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:28,082
I'll turn into a coach

23
00:05:28,667 --> 00:05:31,749
What? You're only 19.

24
00:05:32,667 --> 00:05:33,707
Why do you want to be a coach so quickly?

25
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:40,291
I didn't mean to scare you by telling you to take a break. You can be around at least 10 years.

26
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:42,416
You shouldn't rush to be a coach.

27
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:49,624
I think about it for a while.

28
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:54,207
I'd better be a coach creating new athletes.

29
00:05:56,250 --> 00:06:03,207
I've been around boxing since very young. I have some experience. I think I can coach others.

30
00:06:12,042 --> 00:06:13,249
So, up to you.

31
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:15,749
Well , start it by being my assistant first

32
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:18,707
Then, I'll find a newbie for you to coach

33
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:20,207
Okay?

34
00:06:20,875 --> 00:06:21,541
Agree

35
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:24,457

Kong, why are there so much people?

45
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,541
Since you've won the match a lot of people come to sign up to our club

46
00:07:05,167 --> 00:07:08,707
Well, you'll start your assistant role today.

47
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:13,166
First, help me in signing up new members

Thank you so much, man.

55
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:51,624
Boxing club is closed now.

56
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:57,207
Don't close, please. I want to sign up.

57
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,457
I'm sorry, my club is full now.

58
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:01,624
Can a club be full?

59
00:08:12,417 --> 00:08:13,249
Hey!

60
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,499
You just cut me in the line.

61
00:08:23,042 --> 00:08:24,124
Don't be retarded.

62
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,332
Can you speak nicely?

63
00:08:27,667 --> 00:08:28,666
Am I not nice?

64
00:08:36,667 --> 00:08:37,457
I'm done.

65
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:39,832
You wasted my time

66
00:08:45,542 --> 00:08:46,749
My club is full

67
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,499
Especially, you...

68
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:54,916
I don't accept you.

69
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:56,124
I will sign up

70
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:57,416
I say the club is full

71
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:00,874
Are you out of your mind?

72
00:09:04,292 --> 00:09:05,957
Joining the boxing club? You?

73
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:09,082
I think you should join other club instead.

74
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:12,291
I'll join this club

75
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:15,166
I'll sign up. no matter what.

76
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:17,874
Do you want to join?

77
00:09:19,667 --> 00:09:20,332
I do not accept.

78
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,207
I'll join.

79
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:24,249
I don't accept.

80
00:09:24,667 --> 00:09:25,457
Hey, what happened?

81
00:09:30,542 --> 00:09:36,207
This fresher don't believe me that our club is full.

82
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:38,957
Who's fresher? I'm transferred.

83
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:43,082
I don't care, you're a first-year for me.

84
00:09:48,167 --> 00:09:50,457
The club is really full I'm the president of the club

85
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:57,249
Please accept me as the last one.

86
00:09:59,417 --> 00:10:00,874
I have some basic skill.

87
00:10:01,292 --> 00:10:02,499
I learn faster than others for sure.

88
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:04,957
I can join a boxing match under the name of the club.

89
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:10,457
What's your name?

90
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:13,666
I'm Ake.

91
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:15,957
I'm a first-year student of ComSci just transferred.

92
00:10:16,542 --> 00:10:20,457

93
00:10:22,542 --> 00:10:23,707
Show me your punch.

94
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:25,957

111
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:32,916
Before introduce about our club. I want to introduce you my assistant.

112
00:12:34,542 --> 00:12:38,249
This is Tue, a second-year student

113
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:41,124
Some of you probably met him

114
00:12:41,667 --> 00:12:45,874
His epithet in the boxing field is Thuttana "Tue" the Beast Killer.

115
00:12:57,875 --> 00:13:01,874
And our club is really serious about practicing, which will start next week onwards.

116
00:13:06,042 --> 00:13:16,082
The good news is you guys here will have chance to practice at a boxing gym that I've contacted with.

117
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:22,916
I'd like y'all to be well-prepared.

118
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:26,200

119
00:13:26,667 --> 00:13:28,200

120
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:42,041

121
00:13:42,667 --> 00:13:43,707

122
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:45,749

Do you still not have epithet?

128
00:13:56,917 --> 00:14:00,666
But, Kong told me he would give me my epithet after the camp.

129
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:07,874
Another thing is Father is very busy, so I still don't have epithet yet.

130
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:12,416
Why did you hit him?

131
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:18,874
Ake

132
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,416
Is Ake not here?
- Yes.

133
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:34,249
How's it going. Tue? Do the checking finish?

134
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:36,874
Good morning, Kong.

135
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:40,291
Done, but Ake is not here yet.

136
00:14:40,667 --> 00:14:43,707
Don't worry, I check on him. You take care here.

137
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:57,041
He didn't pick up my call as well.

138
00:14:57,333 --> 00:15:00,166
Never mind Well, you guys please take your keys from Tue

139
00:15:00,542 --> 00:15:07,249
Go to your room, 2 for each room. After unpacking your belongings, we'll gather again, understand?
- Understand.

140
00:15:07,417 --> 00:15:08,291
Come, take your keys.

141
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:31,332
I don't think Ake will come.

142
00:15:48,292 --> 00:15:49,416
Kong, I'm here.

143
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:51,624
You're late as always.

144
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:53,291
You're not discipline at all.

145
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:57,124
It's just one time. Don't complain.

146
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,916
I'm a coach, why can't I complain you?

147
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,207
You're not.

148
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:04,207
You're just his assistant.

149
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:05,499
Am I your playmate?

150
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:06,749
And am I?

151
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,207
Do you think being a coach assistant make you that powerful?

152
00:16:12,542 --> 00:16:14,041
Stop, both of you

153
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:17,749
If not, I make you both fight on the ring

154
00:16:19,417 --> 00:16:23,082
Ake, be true to yourself. You're late since the first time.

155
00:16:23,917 --> 00:16:25,707
Being a boxer, you have to be disciplined.

156
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:31,624
And most importantly, respect my assistant, please.

157
00:16:35,417 --> 00:16:39,041
- Here, your key. Unpack quickly and follow your friends, we're too late
- Yes, sir.

158
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:40,041
You can go now

159
00:16:43,917 --> 00:16:48,707
Tue. you too Being a coach, you should be more calm

160
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:51,832
This is your first rule

161
00:17:00,125 --> 00:17:01,541
Tue, who's not here?

162
00:17:02,292 --> 00:17:07,749
It's Ake. I think he slacks off.

163
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:10,874
Ake, you bastard, stop lying. Get up and go running now.

164
00:17:11,542 --> 00:17:13,666
Pae and Tue, give them the schedule.

165
00:17:37,542 --> 00:17:39,166
Do you see our practice schedule?

166
00:17:39,417 --> 00:17:42,166
This is the schedule that the boxing gym arranged for us

167
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:44,749
Prepare your body and mind

168
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:46,457
Then, at the end of the camp

169
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:50,166
We will let you try fighting as a match

170
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:55,832
Focus on your practice.

171
00:17:56,667 --> 00:17:58,249
Go. Disband and rest. That's all.

172
00:17:58,917 --> 00:18:00,249
Thank you, sir.

173
00:18:08,917 --> 00:18:09,416
Ake.

174
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:14,207
Put this away.

175
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:18,666
Don't you hear me?

176
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:20,832
I said put this away.

177
00:18:25,875 --> 00:18:26,666
Ake.

178
00:18:29,542 --> 00:18:30,124
Put this away.

179
00:18:49,542 --> 00:18:53,082
Tue, what's wrong between you and Ake?

180
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:55,457
You both always quarrel.

181
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:57,457
I'm not animal like that.

182
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:01,416
I just feel that our chemistry is not right.

183
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,916
Don't worry too much, look at me and you.

184
00:19:06,042 --> 00:19:07,249
We used to dislike each other before.

185
00:19:08,292 --> 00:19:09,541
But now, we're close.

186
00:19:13,875 --> 00:19:16,832
You want to be a coach, right? You must be able to get along well with everyone.

187
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:25,624
Quickly, follow me.

188
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:30,749
Jumping jacks, 50 times. Start.

189
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:35,166
1 2 3 4 5
Count it loudly

190
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:10,249
Concentrate.

191
00:20:23,042 --> 00:20:23,666
Can you do it?

192
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:27,291
If not, I let you go back home.

193
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:30,832
Fuck you.

194
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:33,416
I'm just tired.

195
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:34,707
Not dying.

196
00:20:41,292 --> 00:20:52,332
139 140 141 142 143 144 145 146 147 148 149 150

197
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:56,416
Very good, everyone.

198
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:59,957
Enough for today. Disband and rest, we'll gather later.

199
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:01,416
Disband. Over.

200
00:21:24,917 --> 00:21:25,874
Hello, Kong.

201
00:21:27,333 --> 00:21:28,499
Go, great, very great.

202
00:21:35,042 --> 00:21:36,082
Everyone, follow me.

203
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:38,249
Count.

204
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:41,082
One, two, three

205
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:45,207
One, two, three

206
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:47,749
Two, three, four

207
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:52,041
Six, seven, eight, nine, ten

208
00:21:52,667 --> 00:21:53,707
Switch.

209
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:56,332
- Hello, Kong
- Hello

210
00:21:58,333 --> 00:21:59,916
Tue, who's not here?

211
00:22:08,042 --> 00:22:08,832
It's Ake.

212
00:22:09,208 --> 00:22:09,874
I think he slacks off.

213
00:22:10,667 --> 00:22:13,082
Who does stay in the same room with him?

214
00:22:15,333 --> 00:22:15,957
Me.

215
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:20,249
He has a fever and asks to stay in the room.

216
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:22,249
Really?

217
00:22:24,417 --> 00:22:26,082
I told you, don't think about him too negatively.

218
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:29,416
I'll lead y'all for a run, follow me.

219
00:22:30,625 --> 00:22:31,666
Go and do it willingly.

220
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:50,832
What?

221
00:22:51,625 --> 00:22:52,666
You're sick, aren't you?

222
00:22:58,458 --> 00:22:59,541
Are you really sick?

223
00:23:02,542 --> 00:23:04,249
What? Can't I touch you?

224
00:23:04,458 --> 00:23:07,041
Yes. What's wrong with you?

225
00:23:07,458 --> 00:23:09,082
You're a coach assistant, right?

226
00:23:10,042 --> 00:23:11,249
Try to trust others, can you?

227
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,166
My friend tell you I'm sick.

228
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:15,666
Why do you think I'm lying?

229
00:23:15,958 --> 00:23:16,874
Are you crazy?

230
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,457
Where's your friend?

231
00:23:27,083 --> 00:23:29,499
Ake is sick. He's in the room.

232
00:23:30,083 --> 00:23:31,749
- Again?
- Yes, sir

233
00:23:33,542 --> 00:23:36,620
Pae, why are you late?

234
00:23:37,417 --> 00:23:40,249
Well, Ake is sick again.

235
00:23:40,833 --> 00:23:42,332
- Again?
- Yes, sir.

236
00:23:44,417 --> 00:23:48,240
- Well, y'all go running
- Yes, sir Let's go.

237
00:24:10,458 --> 00:24:11,082
Ake?

238
00:24:13,083 --> 00:24:13,707
Ake.

239
00:24:17,667 --> 00:24:19,207
Ake, wake up.

240
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:22,499
What?

241
00:24:28,875 --> 00:24:29,624
What's wrong with you?

242
00:24:31,833 --> 00:24:33,082
I'm sick.

243
00:24:34,542 --> 00:24:35,541
Why do you ask me like that?

244
00:24:36,917 --> 00:24:38,249
Really?

245
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:42,082
Of course. Why do you think I'm always lying?

246
00:24:58,292 --> 00:25:02,457
Fine, stay on your bed.

247
00:25:03,042 --> 00:25:05,666
- I'll tell Kong about you.
- Fine

248
00:25:38,458 --> 00:25:41,166
Ake, you bastard, stop lying. Get up and go running now.

249
00:25:42,667 --> 00:25:44,957
If you want to be a good boxer, you have to listen to me.

250
00:25:45,958 --> 00:25:47,082
What?

251
00:25:48,708 --> 00:25:50,249
I'm sick, I have to rest.

252
00:25:50,458 --> 00:25:52,041
Are you still lying?

253
00:25:52,542 --> 00:25:55,291
This is orange jasmine's leave, put this in mouth, it will raise body temperature.

254
00:25:56,292 --> 00:25:57,832
Think I don't know about this?

255
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:02,707
What leaves?

256
00:26:03,542 --> 00:26:04,541
I don't know about it.

257
00:26:04,708 --> 00:26:07,832
I study in Agriculture, how can I not know it?

258
00:26:13,625 --> 00:26:14,916
Turn around, open your mouth.

259
00:26:16,625 --> 00:26:19,082
Here, you bastard, your tongue's still green

260
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:28,870
Well, I admit.

261
00:26:29,875 --> 00:26:32,041
I'm too lazy to run almost 10 kilometers.

262
00:26:33,125 --> 00:26:36,166
If you're that lazy, go home.

263
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:42,499
You'll be expelled from the camp and the club.

264
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:45,332
I'll tell Kong about this for sure.

265
00:27:03,875 --> 00:27:09,666
Kong, look what he did. He put this leaves in his mouth to make him looks like having fever.

266
00:27:10,458 --> 00:27:11,749
He fucking lied to us.

267
00:27:12,292 --> 00:27:14,910
I think we should expel him.

268
00:27:15,875 --> 00:27:18,832
You're undisciplined, you can't be a boxer.

269
00:27:21,083 --> 00:27:23,832
- Ake.
- Yes, sir

270
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,082
Do you realize you're wrong this time.

271
00:27:28,417 --> 00:27:32,666
I know I'm sorry, really sorry.

272
00:27:35,875 --> 00:27:36,957
Give me one more chance, please.

273
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:38,249
I won't do it again

274
00:27:38,625 --> 00:27:41,916
Everyone can wake up, why can't you?

275
00:27:52,458 --> 00:27:55,166
I play games until late night.

276
00:27:57,208 --> 00:27:58,416
So, I'm lazy to wake up early.

277
00:28:00,542 --> 00:28:02,457
I'll manage the time better, next time.

278
00:28:03,167 --> 00:28:06,410
You don't wake up because you're lazy.

279
00:28:13,958 --> 00:28:17,499
Kong please I really want *o be a boxer

280
00:28:18,042 --> 00:28:21,874
I won't do it again, I promise.

281
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:27,916
Fine.

282
00:28:31,833 --> 00:28:36,290
- But Tue...
- Yes.

283
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:39,749
You'll be moved to stay with Ake.

284
00:28:41,083 --> 00:28:42,457
What? No way

285
00:28:45,833 --> 00:28:46,749
Let it be this way

286
00:28:48,042 --> 00:28:53,041
Ake, If you're not pleased with this, pack your stuff and go home.

287
00:28:53,208 --> 00:28:58,124
Tue If you can't control him, you'll go home as well.

288
00:28:59,458 --> 00:29:04,874
And if I hear that you both fight each other I'll send both of you home.

289
00:29:07,625 --> 00:29:08,624
You can leave, Ake.

290
00:29:10,875 --> 00:29:11,541
Yes, sir.

291
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:21,749
Kong, what's this? You know I don't like him.

292
00:29:24,958 --> 00:29:28,740
Tue, listen.

293
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:33,916
I know it's not easy, but you must set aside your pride.

294
00:29:35,083 --> 00:29:38,749
You're a coach, you have to get along well with everyone.

295
00:29:41,625 --> 00:29:46,749
If you can do that, you'll be a good coach.

296
00:29:48,125 --> 00:29:52,166
I can't teach you about this, you have to face it yourself.

297
00:29:54,667 --> 00:30:00,666
If you can change Ake to be disciplined and get on well with others...

298
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,082
...or you can change his mind...

299
00:30:06,625 --> 00:30:07,832
...you don't need to learn from me anymore.

300
00:30:12,542 --> 00:30:13,249
Yes, sir.

301
00:30:16,083 --> 00:30:21,832
The test like Ake will make you better.

302
00:30:43,292 --> 00:30:44,916
What are you looking at, Ake?

303
00:30:47,292 --> 00:30:48,082
Because of you!

304
00:30:49,417 --> 00:30:50,666
Don't come for me.

305
00:30:53,042 --> 00:30:55,660
I don't want to fight with you, I don't want to get complained by Kong.

306
00:30:57,542 --> 00:31:02,957
If you don't want to get complained by Kong, listen to me.

307
00:31:09,458 --> 00:31:14,291
You can say what to do. But, if you command me, I won't do it.

308
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:18,916
What's the difference?

309
00:31:20,833 --> 00:31:28,541
Well, If you tell me what to do I'll do it or not depending on my pleasure

310
00:31:30,292 --> 00:31:36,249
But, if you command me, I don't like that and don't do it.

311
00:31:39,125 --> 00:31:45,666
Fine, I'll tell you what to do, not command.

312
00:31:47,208 --> 00:31:52,666
- Okay?
- Yeah

313
00:32:19,333 --> 00:32:21,707
Ake, sleep now.

314
00:32:22,667 --> 00:32:24,291
If you're sleepy, just sleep.

315
00:32:26,417 --> 00:32:27,457
I'm going to play another turn, then I'll sleep.

316
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:37,874
Hey, Tue, what are you doing?

317
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:40,041
What are you doing?

318
00:32:59,125 --> 00:33:07,416
Well, I dare you cross fists with me, one punch each.

319
00:33:08,125 --> 00:33:14,082
We both go home, I don't care about that.

320
00:33:17,667 --> 00:33:18,749
Go on.

321
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:22,916
I dare you.

322
00:33:27,458 --> 00:33:28,124
Go on.

323
00:33:39,875 --> 00:33:41,041
I thought you dare

324
00:33:56,417 --> 00:33:57,950
Ake, wake up.

325
00:35:13,083 --> 00:35:14,832
What's wrong with you?

326
00:35:16,625 --> 00:35:17,707
Are you blushing?

327
00:35:24,042 --> 00:35:25,166
Will you go take a shower or not?

328
00:35:30,125 --> 00:35:31,416
If not...

329
00:35:32,042 --> 00:35:33,291
Will you kiss me again?

330
00:35:36,458 --> 00:35:37,457
Take a shower

331
00:35:38,917 --> 00:35:39,916
Up.

332
00:35:43,458 --> 00:35:45,082
If you want me to get up...

333
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:47,957
...you gotta get down

334
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:52,666
What about this "Up"?

335
00:35:55,208 --> 00:35:56,249
What's ’’get down"?

336
00:36:02,042 --> 00:36:03,832
You gotta get down on it.

337
00:36:04,833 --> 00:36:06,249
It's hard right now.

338
00:36:15,958 --> 00:36:17,249
I'll wait outside.

339
00:36:37,708 --> 00:36:38,332
Ake.

340
00:36:43,417 --> 00:36:44,541
It's time to use this

341
00:36:49,167 --> 00:36:49,749
Well

342
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:51,416
Thank you.

343
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:55,082
Did I just mishear?

344
00:36:56,125 --> 00:36:57,666
Did you say “Thank you”?

345
00:37:01,167 --> 00:37:02,749
What kind of coach are you?

346
00:37:03,083 --> 00:37:06,249
I speak politely, you insult me back.

347
00:37:08,333 --> 00:37:09,332
Just kidding

348
00:37:21,458 --> 00:37:24,249
Woah, Tue, cockroach!

349
00:37:46,875 --> 00:37:49,082
Are there any boxers who fear a cockroach?

350
00:37:50,458 --> 00:37:52,249
If anyone know, you'll embarrass.

351
00:37:52,917 --> 00:37:54,957
But, I fear insects

352
00:37:56,625 --> 00:37:58,124
It's my phobia.

353
00:37:59,542 --> 00:38:01,041
Do they have rules about this?

354
00:38:01,417 --> 00:38:03,207
...about do not fear cockroaches?

355
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:06,041
Well

356
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:07,666
There aren't any

357
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:26,624
What's about you?

358
00:38:27,958 --> 00:38:29,249
Do you fear anything?

359
00:38:33,875 --> 00:38:34,666
Never

360
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:39,249
And what did scare you this morning?

361
00:38:57,125 --> 00:38:58,249
It's you.

362
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:04,082
I don't think you're scared

363
00:39:06,208 --> 00:39:07,541
I think you like it

364
00:39:12,417 --> 00:39:13,457
You bastard

365
00:39:30,083 --> 00:39:31,666
And today, we will practice...

366
00:39:45,167 --> 00:39:46,082
You guys...

367
00:39:47,083 --> 00:39:48,874
Today, we have a special practice...

368
00:39:51,083 --> 00:39:53,207
...to strengthen our neck muscles.

369
00:39:53,542 --> 00:39:54,666
We are Thai boxers.

370
00:39:55,625 --> 00:39:57,207
We get our necks catched and get striked with knees all the time.

371
00:39:58,042 --> 00:40:00,457
If your neck muscles are not strong enough, you die.

372
00:40:00,542 --> 00:40:02,249
And our practice for today is...

373
00:40:03,667 --> 00:40:04,832
Holding loads with mouth.

374
00:40:06,333 --> 00:40:07,666
Well, Tue will demonstrate for you.

375
00:40:08,292 --> 00:40:09,457
Show them.

376
00:40:40,333 --> 00:40:42,124
I'll send Tue to watch over y'all.

377
00:40:42,625 --> 00:40:43,541
Imitate.

378
00:41:40,875 --> 00:41:41,457
Enough

379
00:41:53,667 --> 00:41:54,832
Very good, everyone

380
00:41:56,083 --> 00:41:59,041
Take a break, then, we'll back on the practice.

381
00:42:13,167 --> 00:42:13,957
Here

382
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:15,457
Your phone.

383
00:42:19,083 --> 00:42:19,957
Thank you.

384
00:42:27,875 --> 00:42:29,082
Well...Ake...

385
00:42:33,458 --> 00:42:35,207
...why do yo a want to be a boxer?

386
00:42:41,292 --> 00:42:43,832
I want to follow my father's dream.

387
00:42:46,083 --> 00:42:47,291
When I was young...

388
00:42:47,875 --> 00:42:49,624
...my father was a boxer.

389
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:54,207
But, he got in an accident...

390
00:42:54,625 --> 00:42:56,082
...and missed an important match.

391
00:43:04,167 --> 00:43:06,249
If you want to be a great boxer...

392
00:43:07,667 --> 00:43:09,457
...you have to believe what I tell you.

393
00:43:10,708 --> 00:43:11,666
Understand?

394
00:43:16,958 --> 00:43:18,416
Don't command me

395
00:43:18,750 --> 00:43:20,207
I said ”I told you".

396
00:43:21,458 --> 00:43:22,207
Not command you.

397
00:43:28,083 --> 00:43:29,832
Yes...

398
00:43:31,042 --> 00:43:32,249
Coach Tue.

399
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:48,082
Tue.

400
00:43:50,917 --> 00:43:51,916
Tue.

401
00:43:53,708 --> 00:43:55,541
Tue, wake up

402
00:43:56,250 --> 00:43:57,457
Wake up!

403
00:44:05,083 --> 00:44:05,916
Hey!

404
00:44:07,875 --> 00:44:09,749
Do you have fever, Tue?

405
00:44:11,750 --> 00:44:12,707
Ake...

406
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:15,957
You go practice.

407
00:44:17,292 --> 00:44:18,749
Today, I don't think I'm alright.

408
00:44:21,333 --> 00:44:22,416
I see it.

409
00:44:25,917 --> 00:44:28,041
I'll bring you some medication.

410
00:44:40,750 --> 00:44:42,416
Tue, get up and take this pill.

411
00:44:45,458 --> 00:44:46,499
Get up for just a minute.

412
00:45:12,458 --> 00:45:13,707
I go practicing now.

413
00:45:47,208 --> 00:45:47,874
Tue

414
00:45:48,708 --> 00:45:49,874
I think you should see a doctor.

415
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:52,499
You will get healed in time if it's worst

416
00:45:55,250 --> 00:45:56,957
Ake, take him to hospital.

417
00:45:57,083 --> 00:45:59,290
Me? No way.

418
00:46:04,708 --> 00:46:05,832
It's okay. Kong.

419
00:46:06,875 --> 00:46:07,916
I'll go by myself.

420
00:46:10,667 --> 00:46:12,457
I don't want to bother others

421
00:46:51,083 --> 00:46:51,749
Tue

422
00:46:54,750 --> 00:46:55,666
Tue

423
00:46:57,458 --> 00:46:58,457
Tue

424
00:47:04,292 --> 00:47:05,457
Get on here

425
00:47:08,708 --> 00:47:09,707
Tue

426
00:47:16,417 --> 00:47:18,291
Get on, Tue

427
00:47:19,708 --> 00:47:21,416
I don't want Kong to insult me.

428
00:47:21,458 --> 00:47:24,874
If you take me there because of Kong...

429
00:47:26,833 --> 00:47:27,916
I think you should go back

430
00:47:30,542 --> 00:47:31,874
It's just not that.

431
00:47:35,542 --> 00:47:36,957
I'll take you to hospital...

432
00:47:40,417 --> 00:47:41,707
...because I care about you.

433
00:48:55,083 --> 00:48:58,874
Ake, do you want to move to other rooms? You can tell me.

434
00:49:03,833 --> 00:49:05,166
Never mind.

435
00:49:05,958 --> 00:49:07,499
I couldn't be bothered to move.

436
00:49:08,333 --> 00:49:10,666
I was like this when I was a child

437
00:49:12,833 --> 00:49:14,541
Tue is very sick like this...

438
00:49:16,083 --> 00:49:19,332
...he might want someone with him.

439
00:49:23,417 --> 00:49:25,082
So, it's up to you.

440
00:49:28,250 --> 00:49:29,457
You should rest enough, too

441
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:10,416
Ake...

442
00:50:12,750 --> 00:50:14,166
...I'm sorry...

443
00:50:14,875 --> 00:50:16,666
...that I set the alarm too many times.

444
00:50:18,167 --> 00:50:21,207
If you're annoyed, you can switch the room.

445
00:50:40,625 --> 00:50:41,832
No problem

446
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:44,666
I get you

447
00:51:03,625 --> 00:51:05,249
In the first 3 days,

448
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:09,874
pimples will appear so much.

449
00:51:14,208 --> 00:51:16,041
But, don't you scratch therm.

450
00:51:18,458 --> 00:51:20,624
If not, you'll get scars on your face.

451
00:51:26,667 --> 00:51:27,874
Do you understand?

452
00:51:30,208 --> 00:51:31,082
Umm

453
00:51:51,667 --> 00:51:53,291
Why do you take care of me so good?

454
00:51:53,292 --> 00:52:01,666
I care about you

455
00:52:23,625 --> 00:52:24,957
I am sick now.

456
00:52:25,042 --> 00:52:26,332
Did you forget it?

457
00:52:27,208 --> 00:52:28,666
I had this fever before.

458
00:52:28,750 --> 00:52:30,416
But, I don't want you to...

459
00:54:18,250 --> 00:54:19,166
Tue...

460
00:54:19,833 --> 00:54:20,874
Wake up.

461
00:54:26,667 --> 00:54:29,541
Tue, I think you should get your body wiped clean.

462
00:54:30,458 --> 00:54:31,874
I'll do it myself.

463
00:54:32,125 --> 00:54:33,457
Don't be stubborn.

464
00:54:34,125 --> 00:54:35,749
You need to get wiped now.

465
00:54:51,125 --> 00:54:51,957
Tue

466
00:54:53,667 --> 00:54:54,916
Get wiped now

467
00:54:55,625 --> 00:54:57,249
Move your body up.

468
00:55:14,083 --> 00:55:15,124
Let's get you wiped clean first.

469
00:55:36,458 --> 00:55:37,957
If I weren't sick now...

470
00:55:43,458 --> 00:55:45,416
...I would give up my body to you.

471
00:55:54,917 --> 00:55:55,916
Fine...

472
00:55:57,417 --> 00:55:59,041
Get better quickly, then.

473
00:56:22,667 --> 00:56:24,249
I just feel confused.

474
00:56:24,917 --> 00:56:27,416
I feel special with someone

475
00:56:27,958 --> 00:56:28,874
Ake, I'm sorry to make you feel awkward.

476
00:56:30,958 --> 00:56:36,082
After my quarantine, I'll pack my stuff quickly, and then walk away from you.
