1
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,079
I guess we...should stay apart for a while.

2
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:11,020
Why?

3
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:12,260
Are you bored of me?

4
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:14,260
I think I'm going to be in love.

5
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:18,839
I want to be exclusive with him.

6
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:44,159
That Gundam,

7
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,599
can I get it back, Choke?

8
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,399
Yes.

9
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,719
It belongs to you,

10
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,079
it was never anyone else's.

11
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,639
But you must promise me

12
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,279
that you won't leave it again.

13
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,319
No, no way.

14
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,999
We will take good care of it.

15
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,959
If possible

16
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,799
I wish this never happen.

17
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,919
Sat?

18
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,079
Why are you sitting here?

19
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:57,439
Choke where did you go? I was looking for you.

20
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,319
I didn't see you so I came to see Top's team play.

21
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,439
Want to have some kicks.

22
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,999
Sat, are you hungry? I have snacks.

23
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,079
So want this? Stress relief.

24
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,479
Gum!

25
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,839
Shh, the teacher's around.

26
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,039
She'd take it..

27
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,119
Bought one for you too.

28
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,319
Is it good? Wanna do a blow challenge?

29
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,999
The smallest loses.

30
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,399
Hey Dwarf, what are you doing here?

31
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,399
Ball blocker.

32
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,679
Hey, speak nicely.

33
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,799
This is not your business, Piggy?

34
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,159
Be quiet.

35
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,559
It's my business, he's my friend.

36
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,039
Do you want to try me?

37
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,039
Choke, I'm fine.

38
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,319
Uh, I'm fine.

39
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,679
But can I play too?

40
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,439
What is taking so long? Just a ball.

41
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,959
Nothing. This dwarf would like a kick.

42
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,199
I guess you couldn't even if you wanted.

43
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,399
Legs like chicken legs, dwarf.

44
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:03,119
If you got kick, you'd cry.

45
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,599
I don't want to be punished.

46
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,999
How do we get to be in your group?

47
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,959
Sat, why do you want to be with them?

48
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,719
Can't you see?

49
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,559
How cool is his gang?

50
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,199
The whole school loves them.

51
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,039
You will be even cooler than them.

52
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,759
We believe that. Let's go heme.

53
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,159
Is Sat here? Open the door.

54
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,599
Ah, Choke, come in, come.

55
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:36,879
What's in the box?

56
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,759
Sat, I give you the toy that you want?

57
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,719
Open it, I just finished making it.

58
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,279
Choke, this is so cool.

59
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,919
It's exactly like the one I saw at the store.

60
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,519
Not totally, there's one thing, Sat.

61
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,799
This one has a power button, it's a heart.

62
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,079
How's that, Choke?

63
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:57,119
I made this with my heart.

64
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,399
And my name is Choke,

65
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,879
So if this figure falls to anyone,

66
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,039
and that person presses the heart button

67
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,439
and pray, the request will come true

68
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,559
And he will be lucky too.

69
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,719
So if me pray, and press it,

70
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,399
when will it come true?

71
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,239
Slow or fast, I can't really tell but

72
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,759
it will definitely come true. I asked my father.

73
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,839
So... can I get started?

74
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,199
Where are you going

75
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,759
Sat, why are you here?

76
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,999
Gundam Choke, I pray

77
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:35,199
that Top and the gang take me in.

78
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:40,159
Dwarf, why did you come here?

79
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,519
Top, can we play football and hang with you?

80
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:46,159
Yes, if you do something,

81
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,439
I'll accept you in.

82
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,519
Whatever it is, tell me.

83
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,279
You have to punch your friend, Choke

84
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,559
and chase him away.

85
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,039
Then you can join our group.

86
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,559
Piggy, you and me are not friends anymore.

87
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,599
Hey Dwarf!

88
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,839
Do you really think you can be in my group?

89
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,199
Little shit.

90
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:18,799
Wish I am 18, and be in a cool universe

91
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,799
Wish I grow up to be the most handsome, the hottest.

92
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,919
People will be in love with me.

93
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,919
Headache.

94
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:50,919
Are you okay?

95
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:52,919
Wanna see a doctor?

96
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,399
- Who are you?
- Oh.

97
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,519
Friend of Sam?

98
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,359
And where am I?

99
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,719
Sat, are you serious?

100
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,519
Don't joke like this.

101
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,959
I'm serious.

102
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,719
I'm not kidding.

103
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,959
Who are you, P'? Where did my brother go?

104
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,959
- And where is this place?
- Are you crazy?

105
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,839
Call me P'.

106
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:32,039
Just a fall and you got Alzheimer's?

107
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,119
I'm Top, your best friend.

108
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:37,879
Top...

109
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,679
- Which top?
- Top who?

110
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,519
I'm still young.

111
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,279
How can you be my friend?

112
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,470
Hey, don't you really remember me?

113
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:04,919
What?

114
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,119
What?

115
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,479
Wow!

116
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,399
Sat, what's the matter for you?

117
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,719
What's it?

118
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,479
Wait a minute... What did you say your name is?

119
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:47,999
Top.

120
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:49,959
Top...

121
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,799
Top that called me a dwarf and

122
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,639
didn't let me play join the football team?

123
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,359
Well, yes, and that was decades ago.

124
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,119
Why are you talking about it?

125
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,999
Now that two of us are close friends?

126
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,199
Yea.

127
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,799
And what year is this?

128
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,039
2021

129
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,519
- 2021...
- Why?

130
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,039
One... two... three... four... five... six...

131
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,759
Seven years!

132
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,639
Seven years?

133
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,439
That I came through.

134
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,119
This is crazy.

135
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,799
What? What?

136
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,319
What are you complaining about?

137
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,479
No, nothing.

138
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,399
If nothing else, I'll go.

139
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,559
- OK.
- Bye.

140
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,399
- See you.
- Yes.

141
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,599
Call P'Sam. Call P'Sam.

142
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,879
What is this phone?

143
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:54,919
So cool.

144
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,919
It was iPhone 6. What is this iPhone?

145
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,719
P'Sam, can I... can I talk to you?

146
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,919
Mom and Dad go to Beijing?! Why don't they take me too?

147
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,319
I want to go with you.

148
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,959
Mother, this is Sat.

149
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,999
Can I talk to Choke?

150
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:17,159
Mom, can I have Choke's phone number?

151
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:24,279
Hello, where are you, Choke?

152
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,039
Can I go see Choke?

153
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,519
Do we know each other?

154
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,159
The other day we're sleeping together.

155
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,239
Did you remember correctly?

156
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,639
I was looking for a person named Choke.

157
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,159
Choke, the fat one?

158
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,639
Choke that like to do gestures like this.

159
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,079
My name is Choke

160
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:35,639
but I'm not fat.

161
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,559
I'm sorry.

162
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,599
Sat!

163
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,159
Choke!

164
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,319
It's really you!

165
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,159
You remember me... right?

166
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,039
Sat...

167
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,159
Do you want to go inside?

168
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,799
Ummm.

169
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,279
Are you hungry?

170
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,639
Ummm.

171
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,799
Choke, do you have any snacks?

172
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,519
No

173
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,199
but I have a sandwich.

174
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,719
- Can you eat it?
- Um.

175
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,079
Choke...

176
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,239
Here, a sandwich.

177
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,919
Thank you.

178
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,239
Why are you hungry?

179
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,799
I don't know.

180
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:41,879
When I woke up..

181
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,519
was really hungry.

182
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,559
It's like I haven't eaten anything.

183
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,399
So Choke..

184
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,959
This is gonna sound very weird.

185
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,239
Yesterday...

186
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,559
was just a kid.

187
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,639
And now?

188
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,439
I'm 18 years old.

189
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,039
- I'm so confused...
- Sat...

190
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,479
Are you okay?

191
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,359
You should party less and drink less.

192
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,679
Are you sick?

193
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,319
Do you want to see a doctor?

194
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,839
No, no, no.

195
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,759
I'm not sick.

196
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,639
I'm very serious.

197
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,839
I can't remember a thing.

198
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,159
You can't remember anything?

199
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,359
So, you...

200
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,439
You come here for reminding?

201
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,199
Can you do that?

202
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:45,839
I will try.

203
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:58,119
Well... after the end of the year six,

204
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:02,919
you...

205
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,639
got into the provincial boarding school

206
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:12,239
and got to be school's footballer.

207
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,239
Joined Top's group.

208
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:22,839
The coolest group

209
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,679
and the hottest.

210
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:28,039
- Me?
- Umm.

211
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,039
I have become a footballer

212
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,519
and joined Top's gang as well?

213
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,679
Yes!

214
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:40,999
You got to be the boss.

215
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,599
Because you are the most handsome...

216
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,559
And the best figured.

217
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,319
The girls are crazy.

218
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:54,879
So what next?

219
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,559
After that..

220
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,879
You get into a university

221
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,839
studying in the faculty that you liked.

222
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,079
It is also the best university as well.

223
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,359
You're not just a faculty star...

224
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,679
But you are also a college star.

225
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,559
What I asked...

226
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,959
all came true?

227
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,199
And you

228
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,159
Are you studying in the same place?

229
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,079
No.

230
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,839
I study at another uni.

231
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:18,599
So Sat...

232
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,239
There is one more truth..

233
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,159
That you might have forgotten

234
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,759
The fact that..

235
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,159
We are no longer friends.

236
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,599
The two of us are

237
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,199
no longer friends?

238
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,119
Since the end of year six,

239
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,559
we grew apart

240
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,359
and never met again.

241
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,119
We all have our own friends.

242
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,879
Hey, don't think too much.

243
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:22,599
It's been a long time.

244
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:25,799
So...

245
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,959
now that you know everything.

246
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,519
Are you leaving? I'll send you off.

247
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,039
But you don't have to drop me off.

248
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:43,799
I can go back by myself.

249
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,199
Thank you very much for today.

250
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:52,839
Uh... Sat...

251
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:54,879
Take care.

252
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:56,879
Don't drink too much.

253
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:58,759
I know.

254
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,359
I'll come see you again, Choke.

255
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,479
Ummm.

256
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:15,919
What I asked...

257
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,399
everything came true?

258
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:21,310
Wish I'd be 18, be in a cool university.

259
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,159
Wish I grow up to be the most handsome one,

260
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,879
and the hottest. People will be in love with me.

261
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,639
Top!

262
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,999
Sorry. Got a little detour.

263
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,079
Why did you dress up like this?

264
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,159
Why?

265
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:30,839
So childish.

266
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,479
Childish?

267
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,759
But cute.

268
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,759
It is not difficult to date, a face like you

269
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:51,959
Come, come, come and cheers.

270
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,079
So strong.

271
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,159
What's strong?

272
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,999
Usually you drink this much.

273
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,759
- Really?
- Yes.

274
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,639
Bottoms up, fast.

275
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,399
I think that girl...

276
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,479
is checking you out.

277
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:50,679
- Me?
- Yeah. Look, look.

278
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,119
Are you sure?

279
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,159
Your memory has deteriorated.

280
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,599
That is your girl, Bro.

281
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,399
This person I know?

282
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:08,999
Sure, dude.

283
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:13,519
Nong Sat...

284
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,479
Why are you dressed so cute today?

285
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,039
I gonna go to the bathroom.

286
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:42,119
I'll be back.

287
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,119
Oh Sat!

288
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,279
Do we... know each other?

289
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,399
I miss you.

290
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,079
What the fuck?

291
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,719
The other day we were sleeping together.

292
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,439
Do you remember correctly?

293
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,359
Top...

294
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,119
I gonna go home.

295
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,639
I'm... I'm feeling a little sick.

296
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,079
I'll see you.

297
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,479
- What's going on, bro?
- Okay?

298
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:24,359
We had fun in the bathroom that night.

299
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,359
Hey, let go!

300
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:30,119
The other day, we just had sex here.

301
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:32,359
The other day we were sleeping together.

302
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:34,879
Do you remember correctly?

303
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,639
Wish I grow up to be the most handsome

304
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,279
and hottest one. People will be in love with me.

305
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:00,679
- What's up, Sat?
-Choke...

306
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:03,879
Can I go see you?

307
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:16,679
And if you'd date someone

308
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,799
what type of person do you want?

309
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,119
Sat...

310
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,679
Anything on your mind?

311
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,519
It couldn't be, Choke.

312
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,559
I just felt that...

313
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:05,079
my life is meaningless day after day.

314
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,679
But it's exactly what you wanted it to be.

315
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:09,759
Isn't it?

316
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,639
Yes, it is

317
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,159
but I'm not happy.

318
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:37,399
I feel like... anyone...

319
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,039
And everyone I'm involved with...

320
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,559
I'm involved with the wrong people.

321
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,679
Sat...

322
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:49,959
Don't think too much.

323
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,799
Everything happens for a reason.

324
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:01,719
We cannot change the past.

325
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:21,559
I know

326
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:27,159
but I wish I could turn back time.

327
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,039
I hope...

328
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,079
can go back to the time when..

329
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:35,639
we were running around.

330
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,159
Just had fun.

331
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,719
Didn't have to think of anything.

332
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:46,999
Sat...

333
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:51,799
But we've passed that point.

334
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,679
Don't dwell on the past.

335
00:33:59,000 --> 00:33:59,999
You have to move on.

336
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:05,639
Make your mind at peace.

337
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:24,239
Of course!

338
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,319
Then..

339
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,679
can I stay at your place tonight?

340
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:45,559
You're always welcome.

341
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,279
Sat...

342
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,199
I have this for you.

343
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,159
Do you want some?

344
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,159
You might feel better.

345
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:21,159
You still carry snacks around. Never change a bit.

346
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,359
I am scary.

347
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:34,999
When I get to sit

348
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,399
and eat something sweet,

349
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,239
it will make me feel better.

350
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,679
- Choke...
- Hm?

351
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,390
I feel like you and me...

352
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,399
grew apart, I don't know how.

353
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,519
Will it be okay...

354
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:14,879
if I wish us become close like before.

355
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,959
In fact, you didn't have to ask me

356
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:26,839
because I'm embarrassed.

357
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,159
You're my closest friend.

358
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,079
Choke, you're a good friend.

359
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,439
If anyone has Choke as boyfriend,

360
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:22,919
must be very lucky.

361
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:45,479
Nobody wants me as a boyfriend.

362
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,519
I'm boring.

363
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,319
Not as interesting as other people.

364
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,279
I don't speak well...

365
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:04,839
I don't travel.

366
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,479
Plus, I got teased often.

367
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:14,599
If I'm a soup...

368
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,479
I'd be the clearest soup.

369
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,679
But it must be true, if I had more

370
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,919
I wouldn't be single for this long.

371
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,479
If not, then it means you...

372
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:39,879
you haven't dated anyone.

373
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,359
How?

374
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:58,919
I wait for...

375
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:05,799
my soul mate to be born.

376
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:30,279
And if you...

377
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:32,919
will have a someone,

378
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:39,079
what type do you want?

379
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,639
I don't know yet

380
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,359
but if I really have to choose...

381
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,119
I want to start with friend first..

382
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,359
and upgrade to boyfriend.

383
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,159
So... do you want to start with friends?

384
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,039
Like in the series?

385
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,359
Yes.

386
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:40,599
Come in.

387
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,159
Let's play like when we were kids.

388
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:47,519
Of course!

389
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:45,999
Can you be my only friend?

390
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:47,799
And mine only?

391
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:03,479
can be anything...

392
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:05,319
And everything...

393
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:07,319
For you.

394
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:45,719
Are you still afraid of thunder?

395
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,279
Do you want to go in?

396
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:45,399
If you kiss me again, I won't be your friend anymore.

397
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:28,439
Choke...

398
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:38,599
You still keep pictures of us?

399
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:48,839
I kept all the photos of my friends.

400
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:54,639
I have photos of Top too.

401
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:57,759
Umm.

402
00:45:59,000 --> 00:45:59,999
I saw that.

403
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:35,559
Uh... Are you sleepy?

404
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:39,239
Then...

405
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:41,839
you sleep in here.

406
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:45,159
I will go out and sleep on the sofa.

407
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:43,559
Are you crazy?

408
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:47,079
This is your room.

409
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:51,159
Let's just stay together

410
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:54,599
like when we were young.

411
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:02,679
If you want me to stay...

412
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:05,399
I will stay.

413
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:33,559
You're...

414
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:36,399
very mature, aren't you?

415
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:40,919
Sat...

416
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:44,039
Hmm?

417
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:48,519
I wish you...

418
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:50,359
you go easy on drinking and eating.

419
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:02,679
I don't want to be bossy with you

420
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:04,999
but...

421
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:06,999
I'm just...

422
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:08,079
worried.

423
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:16,159
Worried...

424
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:48,919
If you kiss again,
'm not going to be just friend anymore.

425
00:52:57,240 --> 00:52:58,279
Good

426
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:03,119
night.

427
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:50,119
Don't be afraid.

428
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:40,519
Choke... why do we stop being friends?

429
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:43,500
He's disgusting. Don't  go near.

430
00:56:43,580 --> 00:56:44,540
What's disgusting?

431
00:56:44,620 --> 00:56:45,620
I don't know. What's happening?

432
00:56:45,700 --> 00:56:47,940
You don't know or it's normal for you?

433
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:49,399
Go back and watch your clip.

434
00:56:49,780 --> 00:56:50,780
If possible...

435
00:56:51,060 --> 00:56:52,580
I wish this would never happen.
