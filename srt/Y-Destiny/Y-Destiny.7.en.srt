1
00:00:05,146 --> 00:00:06,160
You never kiss before?

2
00:00:10,458 --> 00:00:12,166
Don't tell me you love that kid.

3
00:00:12,167 --> 00:00:15,166
Don't want you to think or feel too much.

4
00:00:17,167 --> 00:00:19,166
Why did you hug and kiss him?

5
00:00:38,292 --> 00:00:40,207
You guys wai The Godfather quickly.

6
00:00:48,167 --> 00:00:49,166
The Godfather is here.

7
00:00:51,125 --> 00:00:55,166
If you have questions, just ask.

8
00:01:00,083 --> 00:01:04,124
Godfather, will I be retired this semester?

9
00:01:06,167 --> 00:01:12,207
Which field of study are you in?

10
00:01:14,208 --> 00:01:15,207
Pure physics.

11
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:16,291
What?

12
00:01:19,167 --> 00:01:22,166
Pure Physics? I do not understand.

13
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:25,166
Say again.

14
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:29,207
I said say that again!

15
00:01:30,208 --> 00:01:33,166
Kao! Speak the Godfather's language.

16
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:37,207
He was born a hundred years ago,

17
00:01:38,208 --> 00:01:39,291
wouldn't understand what we speak.

18
00:01:40,125 --> 00:01:41,124
Oh okay.

19
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:47,207
I learned the science of computation.

20
00:01:50,208 --> 00:01:52,207
Full on, bro.

21
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:13,124
You guys will pass this course.

22
00:02:16,167 --> 00:02:26,666
If you take the textbook from your friend sitting in front of your teacher.

23
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:47,124
He has persevered and studied for long.

24
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:51,124
Read only three times.

25
00:02:52,167 --> 00:02:55,207
You will pass easily.

26
00:02:57,125 --> 00:03:00,166
Nothing beyond your intelligence.

27
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:18,166
Godfather you mean lecture, right?

28
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:19,207
That's right.

29
00:03:23,167 --> 00:03:24,124
Lecture.

30
00:03:26,292 --> 00:03:30,124
So I’ll hurry and bring it to you.

31
00:03:32,167 --> 00:03:33,374
would like to excuse myself.

32
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:42,957
Are you going? I crave the betel nut.

33
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:53,166
And you haven't taken any ornament yet.

34
00:03:54,292 --> 00:04:01,166
Kao, consult and lucky number sticker fees.

35
00:04:09,167 --> 00:04:12,207
And the Sarika (Golden Tongue) candy.

36
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:23,124
Here.

37
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:24,291
Four hundred and ninety-nine baht.

38
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:28,207
Sarika Gold Tongue candy, take it.

39
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:31,249
When you say something, people will love it.

40
00:04:37,167 --> 00:04:40,124
What if I want some, what must I do?

41
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:50,207
You are lucky, Godfather only wants you to have it.

42
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:53,249
Eight hundred and ninety-nine baht.

43
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:57,207
You will get lucky number stickers.

44
00:04:58,583 --> 00:05:00,166
Facial foam, golden face.

45
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:03,207
And Sarika Golden Tongue candy.

46
00:05:24,292 --> 00:05:30,166
You've had enough. Godfather has left.

47
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:32,124
Come get more next time.

48
00:05:32,167 --> 00:05:33,166
Good luck, today.

49
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:35,166
I’ll walk you.

50
00:06:35,167 --> 00:06:36,124
Thurs?

51
00:06:40,167 --> 00:06:41,166
Thurs?

52
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:45,207
Hey, how you kick me, Mon?

53
00:06:46,167 --> 00:06:47,207
I’m the Godfather.

54
00:06:48,167 --> 00:06:49,249
I will curse you.

55
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:53,082
What is your curse?

56
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:01,166
- Here you go. Payment, Godfather.
- Very good.

57
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:10,291
- Thurs?
- Hum?

58
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:15,249
Your Godfather is quite young at heart.

59
00:07:18,167 --> 00:07:19,124
How?

60
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:23,124
As far as I remember, I was the script.

61
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:29,207
So Godfather of what era can understand
the word retire and lecture?

62
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:34,124
Did I slip?

63
00:07:34,167 --> 00:07:35,166
Yes.

64
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:42,166
Well, well, the godfather is of every era.

65
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:44,166
Thurs?

66
00:07:46,167 --> 00:07:51,249
Should we stop using acting up like this?

67
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:55,166
It's like deceiving other people. I don't know.

68
00:07:57,167 --> 00:07:59,082
Mon.

69
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:03,166
- Come here, come here.
- What?

70
00:08:04,167 --> 00:08:06,207
Why are you tryna be a good person now?

71
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:10,166
We just making foretell and selling annulment?

72
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:12,291
That’s why we have money to buy things

73
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:18,041
but...

74
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:23,166
since you got Team, you suddenly want to be a better person?

75
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:28,249
- What?
- Mon?

76
00:08:29,167 --> 00:08:31,207
You must be my good person.

77
00:08:32,292 --> 00:08:35,124
- Come kiss me.
- No, Thurs.

78
00:08:36,292 --> 00:08:38,124
Thurs.

79
00:08:41,292 --> 00:08:42,291
Who?

80
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:45,124
Go open.

81
00:08:45,167 --> 00:08:46,207
Tell them, I don’t do foretell anymore.

82
00:08:49,167 --> 00:08:51,166
- Me again?
- Yep.

83
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:56,207
No more, today.

84
00:09:00,167 --> 00:09:03,166
Oh, P'Team

85
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:10,124
What are you doing?

86
00:09:10,167 --> 00:09:13,124
Well, Mon did not answer my call.

87
00:09:14,167 --> 00:09:15,166
I called many times.

88
00:09:24,167 --> 00:09:26,166
I came to help me with work.

89
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:30,166
Don't be angry with him.

90
00:09:32,167 --> 00:09:34,082
What is this work about?

91
00:09:37,167 --> 00:09:38,166
Here it is.

92
00:09:41,167 --> 00:09:45,124
You play assistant for this phony again?

93
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:51,291
I told you not to deceive other people.

94
00:09:52,167 --> 00:09:55,249
Oh... P'Team.

95
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:57,291
Do not say it out like this.

96
00:09:58,083 --> 00:10:02,291
The work we do makes pure merit.

97
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:07,166
Thurs, it's mine.

98
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:11,957
- So later, dude.
- Yes.

99
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:20,124
Since you got him, you've changed a lot.

100
00:10:30,167 --> 00:10:32,124
Mon, what are you doing?

101
00:10:36,167 --> 00:10:39,249
I'm watching this romantic comedy series.

102
00:10:40,167 --> 00:10:41,166
It's really fun.

103
00:10:45,167 --> 00:10:47,166
- Yeah, Mon?
- Hmm?

104
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:51,166
How was last night? P'Team did you good?

105
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:56,166
Thurs, you are crazy.
- Oops.

106
00:10:58,167 --> 00:10:59,166
Don’t make me hit your eyes.

107
00:11:01,167 --> 00:11:05,207
No need to punch me until my eyes break. My eyes are already twitching.

108
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:08,249
- Twitching?
- Um.

109
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:09,166
Which one is twitching?

110
00:11:10,292 --> 00:11:12,124
Both.

111
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:15,124
I don't know if it's bad or that's good.

112
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:17,166
You think a lot, Thurs.

113
00:11:18,167 --> 00:11:23,082
Never heard of it? Right is not evil, left is more good, see?

114
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:27,249
BS. I only know good left and bad right. Where do you remember from?

115
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:31,082
I don't know.

116
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:32,166
Go away.

117
00:11:39,167 --> 00:11:40,166
Thurs?

118
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:42,166
I have big news to tell you.

119
00:11:43,292 --> 00:11:44,291
What's the big news?

120
00:11:45,167 --> 00:11:47,166
You know, a few days ago...

121
00:11:47,292 --> 00:11:49,082
someone found a corpse.

122
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:51,124
At the swimming pool.

123
00:11:52,167 --> 00:11:55,166
Oh, yes, I heard that.

124
00:11:55,167 --> 00:11:56,124
Why?

125
00:11:56,167 --> 00:11:59,166
As the president of our mysterious dimension club,

126
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:03,666
I want you to join us prove whether it’s true or not.

127
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:07,249
Okay..

128
00:12:08,167 --> 00:12:10,124
Let's do Ouija.

129
00:12:10,292 --> 00:12:14,249
So we can write something on out page.

130
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:17,124
It'll be a hot issue!

131
00:12:17,167 --> 00:12:18,166
Really?

132
00:12:19,167 --> 00:12:20,291
- Yeah.
- Hot!

133
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:25,207
- What?
- Thurs, I don't want to.

134
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:31,124
The pool is closed. If sneaked in, you'll get parole.

135
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:36,249
Gosh. We'll do it at night. No one's there.

136
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:42,166
- But...
- Our page will get traction and pays.

137
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:46,166
Did you prepare the stuff?

138
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:16,749
You guys listen to me.

139
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:20,791
I'll light the incense. Summons the soul into the glass.

140
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:23,832
And we recite the spell at the same time.

141
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:27,916
Put your finger on top of the glass.

142
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:29,874
Importantly,

143
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:31,874
don't forget that you

144
00:13:33,667 --> 00:13:36,332
must never remove your finger.

145
00:13:36,792 --> 00:13:37,791
Do you understand?

146
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:42,666
Khoa Niew get me the incenses.

147
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:06,666
Guardian spirits...

148
00:14:06,792 --> 00:14:07,916
all sacred beings...

149
00:14:08,792 --> 00:14:13,707
I'd like to summon the soul that have died

150
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:22,791
and was found here.

151
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:26,916
The corpse drowned yesterday

152
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:31,874
Please come in this glass...

153
00:14:33,917 --> 00:14:34,874
For us

154
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:37,707
Will know

155
00:14:39,667 --> 00:14:40,749
Who you are

156
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:42,749
And where you come from.

157
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:57,707
Om!

158
00:14:57,833 --> 00:14:58,916
You guys concentrate.

159
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:01,791
And don't forget

160
00:15:02,792 --> 00:15:03,916
Never remove your fingers.

161
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:38,666
Spell

162
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:49,791
Spell

163
00:15:50,917 --> 00:15:52,707
Don't take your finger off.

164
00:15:54,792 --> 00:15:55,916
You're here, right?

165
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:12,916
It's here.

166
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:18,874
Are you male or female?

167
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:30,874
Male.

168
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:38,874
So what were you doing here?

169
00:17:05,792 --> 00:17:07,666
Kill...

170
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:13,832
Killed and got dropped as corpse here?

171
00:17:20,917 --> 00:17:24,791
So is there anything we can help you?

172
00:17:37,667 --> 00:17:38,749
S...

173
00:17:40,708 --> 00:17:41,707
Yes.

174
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:44,707
You hurry up. Ask.

175
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:46,707
Ask what?

176
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:48,832
Should we stop?

177
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:52,916
Wait and see? What he wants for help...

178
00:17:58,708 --> 00:18:01,666
Tell us anything.

179
00:18:06,687 --> 00:18:07,580
- D...E
- D...E

180
00:18:08,792 --> 00:18:09,791
A...

181
00:18:15,917 --> 00:18:17,707
TH...

182
00:18:22,833 --> 00:18:23,874
What does that mean?

183
00:18:26,875 --> 00:18:28,707
SUC...

184
00:18:32,792 --> 00:18:33,832
CESS...

185
00:18:40,917 --> 00:18:42,707
OR...

186
00:18:43,917 --> 00:18:45,832
Death successor.

187
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:56,666
Go!

188
00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:25,666
Help me!

189
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:00,874
Blessing.

190
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:17,749
(Prayer for blessing)

191
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:21,749
It's time now.

192
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:23,749
He's arrived.

193
00:20:24,708 --> 00:20:26,874
From nightmares, it will become good.

194
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:32,666
Father, you know what I dreamed last night?

195
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:37,707
So what do you mean? Who's coming?

196
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:43,499
When the time comes, he will tell you himself.

197
00:21:05,708 --> 00:21:08,666
It's time, he's here.

198
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:11,832
From nightmares, it will become good.

199
00:21:12,708 --> 00:21:13,749
Thurs,

200
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:14,874
what are you doing here?

201
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:17,791
Need to think a little.

202
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:23,666
Yeah, last night I had a scary dream.

203
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:27,832
I dreamed that

204
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:30,874
there was giant coming to catch me

205
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:36,666
and a very big snake helping me out.

206
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:43,332
- And in the morning I went to give alms...
- Yeah.

207
00:21:43,792 --> 00:21:46,916
Father said something strange to me.

208
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:56,832
You think too much, Thurs.

209
00:21:57,917 --> 00:21:58,916
It's nothing

210
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:03,791
but...

211
00:22:04,792 --> 00:22:06,832
it might be true as they say.

212
00:22:07,667 --> 00:22:09,791
Nightmares will turn out good.

213
00:22:11,667 --> 00:22:12,874
- You dream of seeing a giant?
- Yeah.

214
00:22:13,708 --> 00:22:14,707
You'll meet friends

215
00:22:15,708 --> 00:22:21,749
and you dream of seeing a snake. It means that you will meet your soulmate.

216
00:22:23,917 --> 00:22:25,832
I guess it's your time, Thurs.

217
00:22:27,667 --> 00:22:28,916
- Mon, you’re bullshit.
- Oh.

218
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:32,707
Soulmate?

219
00:22:36,667 --> 00:22:38,166
My soulmate hasn't been born yet.

220
00:22:38,833 --> 00:22:40,791
I am a fore teller, I know.

221
00:22:43,708 --> 00:22:45,749
The fore teller can see his own future, huh?

222
00:22:49,667 --> 00:22:50,707
Smarty pants...

223
00:22:52,917 --> 00:22:55,874
Well... if you don't want to have a bad dream

224
00:22:55,917 --> 00:22:58,791
I suggest you get a Dream Catcher.

225
00:22:58,875 --> 00:23:01,791
- Oh... now you know everything.
- Of course.

226
00:23:01,917 --> 00:23:04,707
Dream catcher....

227
00:23:04,792 --> 00:23:08,791
The Dream Catcher, it's foreign. Cannot be used in Thailand.

228
00:23:08,875 --> 00:23:11,666
Who knows?

229
00:23:11,833 --> 00:23:13,791
What you said is really nonsense.

230
00:23:13,875 --> 00:23:15,124
Bye.

231
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:16,874
Hey, wait for me.

232
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:25,707
Yes, P'Team, I'll go back to eat with you.

233
00:23:26,792 --> 00:23:29,749
Okay. Bye bye.

234
00:23:32,792 --> 00:23:34,707
Food date with P'Team again?

235
00:23:35,917 --> 00:23:36,791
Umm.

236
00:23:43,708 --> 00:23:45,707
- Thurs?
- Hum?

237
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:48,666
Is this the sacred stone bracelet?

238
00:23:49,917 --> 00:23:51,707
Yes. Why?

239
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:53,791
I want it.

240
00:23:53,917 --> 00:23:56,791
I want to join the sacred stone society.

241
00:23:57,833 --> 00:24:00,791
- Oh, you want in?
- Um.

242
00:24:03,667 --> 00:24:07,666
This is a Carnelian stone,

243
00:24:07,917 --> 00:24:09,832
of the Chalcedony family.

244
00:24:10,708 --> 00:24:13,916
It will nourish your blood.

245
00:24:17,917 --> 00:24:18,874
Nourish blood?

246
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:24,666
Can you see me? My hands are pink.

247
00:24:25,708 --> 00:24:26,791
- See?
- Right.

248
00:24:27,667 --> 00:24:29,832
Your face is getting pale recently.

249
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:33,916
Your hand is getting pale too.

250
00:24:35,833 --> 00:24:37,749
OMG, Thurs.

251
00:24:37,792 --> 00:24:39,999
- You wanna get one?
- I'll get one. I'll get this one.

252
00:24:40,792 --> 00:24:43,749
You are my best friend, I give you a special price.

253
00:24:43,875 --> 00:24:44,916
- Really?
- Yep.

254
00:24:45,792 --> 00:24:47,332
Nine hundred and ninety-nine baht.

255
00:24:48,792 --> 00:24:52,999
From a thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine

256
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:56,666
but...

257
00:24:58,792 --> 00:24:59,916
if you want to buy it now

258
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:06,707
here are a gold leaf sticker, Sarika candy, and the table of by day lucky color.

259
00:25:06,875 --> 00:25:08,791
Oh, I had everything all.

260
00:25:08,833 --> 00:25:09,874
Well, it's true.

261
00:25:11,708 --> 00:25:15,666
But I just got newer one filled up.

262
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:16,541
Really?

263
00:25:16,708 --> 00:25:19,832
Do you know the mask of Boon Hunter?

264
00:25:20,917 --> 00:25:23,832
- Oh, you know.
- Yeah.

265
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:31,832
And I'll you bee wax to apply on the lips. People will love anything you say.

266
00:25:34,708 --> 00:25:36,666
Very special for my friends.

267
00:25:36,708 --> 00:25:39,874
And Pixiu from China.

268
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:43,916
All of them have been consecrated.

269
00:25:44,875 --> 00:25:45,832
Super Holy.

270
00:25:47,708 --> 00:25:48,707
Okay!

271
00:25:48,792 --> 00:25:50,166
Transfer the amount to my account.

272
00:25:50,917 --> 00:25:51,832
Later then.

273
00:25:52,708 --> 00:25:54,916
But this bracelet is the last in stock.

274
00:25:55,792 --> 00:25:58,624
I don’t know if you don't transfer now, it might...

275
00:25:58,792 --> 00:26:02,291
Nah... I'll get P'Team to transfer to you.

276
00:26:02,667 --> 00:26:06,916
- Oh... that's worse, if he transfers late.
- Please.

277
00:26:07,917 --> 00:26:09,874
- You will absolutely get it?
- Yes.

278
00:26:13,833 --> 00:26:14,874
I’ll lock them for you.

279
00:26:15,917 --> 00:26:16,791
Let me check.

280
00:26:21,667 --> 00:26:22,666
Kay..

281
00:26:32,708 --> 00:26:33,832
- Thurs?
- Hmm?

282
00:26:35,708 --> 00:26:39,832
Do you feel like someone is staring at us?

283
00:26:51,667 --> 00:26:52,666
You feel it too, right?

284
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:58,832
Do you think it is...?

285
00:27:31,042 --> 00:27:32,707
I don't accept 2 people. Can't stack three.

286
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:36,791
What two people? I am alone.

287
00:27:41,833 --> 00:27:45,707
Hey guys, can you get off here?

288
00:27:45,833 --> 00:27:46,874
I have to change shift.

289
00:27:54,667 --> 00:27:56,666
What guys?

290
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:01,791
You and your friends here?

291
00:28:02,667 --> 00:28:04,666
But I came alone.

292
00:28:04,875 --> 00:28:07,832
Alone? No. What about that white shirt dude?

293
00:28:15,667 --> 00:28:18,874
- What?
- Brother, this is money. I'll get off here.

294
00:28:20,792 --> 00:28:21,749
Thank you.

295
00:28:24,917 --> 00:28:27,666
What is it, don't you get off?

296
00:28:33,667 --> 00:28:34,791
Damn, right in the morning.

297
00:29:09,417 --> 00:29:11,374
Godfather, sir?

298
00:29:11,417 --> 00:29:16,416
How is my love life doing?

299
00:29:19,417 --> 00:29:22,249
OMG, this is so funny.

300
00:29:22,292 --> 00:29:23,374
Quiet!

301
00:29:27,292 --> 00:29:30,374
Your soul mate hasn't been born yet.

302
00:29:30,417 --> 00:29:35,249
The person you are engaging with... No!

303
00:29:35,292 --> 00:29:38,249
I told you, he hasn't been born yet.

304
00:29:39,375 --> 00:29:41,249
You lied again, Thurs.

305
00:29:41,292 --> 00:29:42,416
My hubby said that

306
00:29:43,167 --> 00:29:46,166
he will marry me after graduation.

307
00:29:46,167 --> 00:29:47,291
Not worth seeing at all.

308
00:29:47,333 --> 00:29:50,374
- It's a waste of time, you guys.
- True that, so fake...

309
00:29:50,417 --> 00:29:52,416
Are you accusing me?

310
00:29:57,167 --> 00:29:58,166
Hey!

311
00:30:01,417 --> 00:30:04,249
Let's go.

312
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:09,374
You guys apologize to the godfather now.

313
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:11,332
Now...

314
00:30:12,208 --> 00:30:14,207
- Say sorry.
- Hurry...

315
00:30:14,208 --> 00:30:16,249
- I'm sorry.

316
00:30:19,208 --> 00:30:22,416
This time I'll forgive you

317
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:27,374
but I won't help you guys anymore.

318
00:30:29,208 --> 00:30:30,374
Get out!

319
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:32,416
Let's go.

320
00:30:43,292 --> 00:30:44,374
Thurs?

321
00:30:45,208 --> 00:30:46,374
Gone.

322
00:30:48,208 --> 00:30:49,416
Shit..

323
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:54,124
What should we do? The lights keep going on and off.

324
00:30:54,167 --> 00:30:55,291
Huh?

325
00:30:56,208 --> 00:30:59,207
I don't know, I didn't do it.

326
00:31:00,375 --> 00:31:02,207
Umm...

327
00:31:09,167 --> 00:31:11,166
Didn't you do that?

328
00:31:11,292 --> 00:31:13,291
Yes...

329
00:31:26,333 --> 00:31:28,249
Then..

330
00:31:29,375 --> 00:31:31,249
A ghost?

331
00:31:31,292 --> 00:31:33,374
Wow, Mon, don't make me hit you.

332
00:31:34,208 --> 00:31:36,291
Oh, then..

333
00:31:37,167 --> 00:31:40,249
It just goes on and off.

334
00:31:40,333 --> 00:31:41,374
Maybe?

335
00:31:42,333 --> 00:31:44,332
Really?

336
00:31:44,375 --> 00:31:46,332
Yes...

337
00:31:49,208 --> 00:31:54,332
So... I think I'd better go home.

338
00:31:54,333 --> 00:31:58,249
- Let's go.
- Gosh! So you're not gonna stay with me?

339
00:32:03,167 --> 00:32:07,332
Hey! Ugh! Ugh! Ugh!

340
00:32:20,333 --> 00:32:27,374
NAMOTASSAPAKAWATOARAHATOSAMSAMPUDTHASSA.

341
00:32:48,333 --> 00:32:50,207
Ah...

342
00:32:54,208 --> 00:32:57,332
Ah...

343
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:11,041
Are you a ghost?

344
00:33:13,167 --> 00:33:14,374
Yes, I am.

345
00:33:15,417 --> 00:33:19,207
But you don't have to be afraid. I came in peace.

346
00:33:19,208 --> 00:33:20,374
came to ask for help.

347
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:24,249
What do you need?

348
00:33:25,208 --> 00:33:27,249
I can't help you.

349
00:33:27,417 --> 00:33:30,416
But... you really can help me.

350
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:32,416
Can't.

351
00:33:33,292 --> 00:33:37,207
What’d you like? I will make alms for you.

352
00:33:38,208 --> 00:33:42,166
But... don't take me as successor.

353
00:33:42,208 --> 00:33:47,374
Um... chill man. I really came in peace.

354
00:33:47,375 --> 00:33:51,166
Well, look at me. I look the same as you.

355
00:33:53,208 --> 00:33:55,249
I just don't exist in physical world.

356
00:33:55,333 --> 00:33:57,291
Don't you exist?

357
00:33:58,250 --> 00:33:59,416
I'm a ghost.

358
00:34:00,333 --> 00:34:04,166
But... I look like real people.

359
00:34:09,208 --> 00:34:11,416
Well... whatever.

360
00:34:11,417 --> 00:34:15,166
So, you are going to help us?

361
00:34:15,208 --> 00:34:16,374
Ah.. OK.

362
00:34:17,208 --> 00:34:18,416
What do you want?

363
00:34:18,417 --> 00:34:20,332
Umm...

364
00:34:21,292 --> 00:34:27,207
I don't have one right now, yet. Still can't figure it out one.

365
00:34:27,375 --> 00:34:35,374
Huh... don't know yet. So why are you here? Go back and think before you come.

366
00:34:36,333 --> 00:34:37,416
I was told to come.

367
00:34:41,417 --> 00:34:43,249
Who told you?

368
00:34:43,333 --> 00:34:45,416
He who take care of my soul.

369
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:49,332
He told me to meet you and live with you.

370
00:34:49,333 --> 00:34:52,166
And you will help me out.

371
00:34:52,167 --> 00:34:55,291
Right now, we don't know what you can help me with

372
00:34:55,292 --> 00:34:58,291
but he said I will know when the time comes.

373
00:35:02,167 --> 00:35:04,332
He told you to come?
- Um.

374
00:35:07,208 --> 00:35:09,374
- To stay with me?
- Yes.

375
00:35:13,167 --> 00:35:14,416
There is no other choice?

376
00:35:15,208 --> 00:35:18,416
Oh... Nope.

377
00:35:36,167 --> 00:35:38,249
It's time.

378
00:35:38,292 --> 00:35:40,207
He's here.

379
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:43,291
Nightmares will turn out good.

380
00:35:43,292 --> 00:35:46,332
Father, what do you mean? Who's coming?

381
00:35:47,167 --> 00:35:51,374
When it's time, he will tell you himself.

382
00:35:57,208 --> 00:36:00,332
Ah, okay, okay.

383
00:36:03,333 --> 00:36:04,416
Really?

384
00:36:05,417 --> 00:36:09,166
Oh... but there must be an agreement.

385
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:11,207
Agreement?

386
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:13,207
Umm, say what you want.

387
00:36:13,333 --> 00:36:16,249
But before I agree,

388
00:36:18,292 --> 00:36:20,249
you're really a good ghost?

389
00:36:20,333 --> 00:36:23,291
Yes, I am good ghost.

390
00:36:24,333 --> 00:36:27,332
So, stay still.

391
00:36:28,167 --> 00:36:29,207
Steady...

392
00:36:29,208 --> 00:36:30,332
Still...

393
00:36:30,375 --> 00:36:32,291
Don't move.

394
00:36:34,167 --> 00:36:37,207
Oh... where are you going?

395
00:36:41,417 --> 00:36:43,374
Ugh...

396
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:51,166
First of all,

397
00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:54,332
when you come to me

398
00:36:55,208 --> 00:36:58,249
you have to come in good condition.

399
00:36:58,292 --> 00:37:02,249
No blood. No deformed.

400
00:37:03,333 --> 00:37:05,207
Like...

401
00:37:05,375 --> 00:37:07,332
Second,

402
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:10,374
you have to help me make a living.

403
00:37:11,292 --> 00:37:12,416
There..

404
00:37:17,208 --> 00:37:18,416
Because if I don't have money,

405
00:37:19,375 --> 00:37:22,249
I can't really help you.

406
00:37:24,333 --> 00:37:26,291
Like...

407
00:37:27,167 --> 00:37:28,416
Like it

408
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:34,249
Just two?

409
00:37:34,292 --> 00:37:37,207
- Can you remember?
- Um.

410
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:42,291
I just become ghost. I’m not very good.

411
00:37:42,333 --> 00:37:44,291
But I will try.

412
00:37:45,292 --> 00:37:46,374
Yes...

413
00:37:47,417 --> 00:37:49,249
Oh...

414
00:37:51,333 --> 00:37:53,332
I forgot to ask your name.

415
00:37:53,333 --> 00:37:56,291
name is...

416
00:37:56,333 --> 00:37:58,291
Umm...

417
00:38:00,208 --> 00:38:03,291
I don't know. Can you name me?

418
00:38:03,417 --> 00:38:05,291
Don't have a name?

419
00:38:05,375 --> 00:38:07,291
No.

420
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:21,374
Pao and Phone, choose one name.

421
00:38:27,333 --> 00:38:29,416
I don't know. You choose for me.

422
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:37,207
So... let's go with Pao.

423
00:38:37,417 --> 00:38:41,332
- Pao?
- Well, my dog's name is Pao.

424
00:38:41,375 --> 00:38:44,332
When I call it feels a little familiar

425
00:38:44,333 --> 00:38:46,207
Pao...

426
00:38:47,333 --> 00:38:49,291
Pao...

427
00:38:49,375 --> 00:38:51,207
Like...

428
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:52,291
Pao...

429
00:38:53,375 --> 00:38:55,291
Yes...

430
00:38:57,208 --> 00:38:58,291
Like it!

431
00:38:59,208 --> 00:39:00,291
Yes...

432
00:39:01,167 --> 00:39:04,332
- Well, I'll go to sleep now.
- Um.

433
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:16,332
And as a ghost, what can you do?

434
00:39:17,208 --> 00:39:18,374
Now?

435
00:39:19,208 --> 00:39:24,207
Umm... I can disappear and move things.

436
00:39:26,292 --> 00:39:30,291
How about fore telling the lottery or

437
00:39:30,292 --> 00:39:33,291
know what will happen in the future? Can you?

438
00:39:33,333 --> 00:39:36,332
Whoa, that must be a long-lived ghost.

439
00:39:36,375 --> 00:39:39,332
I'm a novice, I can’t do that.

440
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:43,291
- Is there such a thing?
- Umm. Yes.

441
00:39:43,292 --> 00:39:47,249
Ghost that has been around for a long time, if they do good

442
00:39:47,250 --> 00:39:50,166
or they got merit from lots of people,

443
00:39:50,208 --> 00:39:53,291
we're more likely to unlock higher skills.

444
00:39:53,333 --> 00:39:55,166
Just like..

445
00:39:55,333 --> 00:39:57,207
level up!

446
00:39:57,333 --> 00:39:59,416
And skills up!

447
00:40:00,167 --> 00:40:03,291
Umm... maybe?

448
00:40:03,333 --> 00:40:05,291
Oh...

449
00:40:06,292 --> 00:40:08,249
That's one hell of a story.

450
00:40:19,292 --> 00:40:21,207
Oh...

451
00:40:21,375 --> 00:40:24,332
Umm... It's already late.

452
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:27,207
I have to sleep.

453
00:40:27,292 --> 00:40:29,332
Umm, go on.

454
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:33,291
So what are you going to do?

455
00:40:33,375 --> 00:40:36,332
As a ghost, do you have to sleep?

456
00:40:36,375 --> 00:40:38,249
No sleep.

457
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:41,332
Well, I don't have a body to rest.

458
00:40:41,375 --> 00:40:43,291
So I will..

459
00:40:44,333 --> 00:40:46,374
go out to meet a friend around here.

460
00:40:49,167 --> 00:40:51,374
- Do you have friends too?
- Um. I do.

461
00:40:51,417 --> 00:40:54,374
Where are they?

462
00:40:55,208 --> 00:40:59,207
But, but you don't have to bring them.

463
00:40:59,292 --> 00:41:02,332
This is another rule.

464
00:41:02,333 --> 00:41:07,207
Don't worry. Even if you want to meet them, you will not be able to.

465
00:41:07,208 --> 00:41:11,207
It must be something that bond them.

466
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:14,291
Regardless of it is. They will meet.

467
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:24,291
It means that..

468
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:31,207
we two did something together?

469
00:41:41,167 --> 00:41:45,291
I'll sleep now.

470
00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:52,166
But what is your name?

471
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:53,332
Oh...

472
00:41:56,208 --> 00:41:58,291
My name is Thurs.

473
00:41:59,167 --> 00:42:00,249
Thurs.

474
00:42:01,208 --> 00:42:02,332
Thurs.

475
00:42:03,375 --> 00:42:05,291
We like this name..

476
00:42:05,292 --> 00:42:06,374
Like it.

477
00:42:08,375 --> 00:42:09,416
Pao.

478
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:13,291
- Thurs?
- Um...

479
00:42:14,167 --> 00:42:15,332
So...

480
00:42:17,250 --> 00:42:19,374
good night, Thurs.

481
00:42:20,333 --> 00:42:22,332
Umm...

482
00:42:52,375 --> 00:42:56,249
Good night, ding-dong ghost.

483
00:42:58,292 --> 00:42:59,332
I'm back.

484
00:42:59,333 --> 00:43:03,207
- So let's go on a trip today.
- Go, go, me like.

485
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:17,499
This is Luang Father.

486
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:26,416
Luang Father, you know what am I gonna say?

487
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:28,582
You met him.

488
00:43:29,417 --> 00:43:30,624
Take care of him.

489
00:43:31,417 --> 00:43:33,457
Help him.

490
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:35,582
Make merit for him too

491
00:43:35,583 --> 00:43:37,624
To help him escape.

492
00:43:38,417 --> 00:43:42,457
If you can, it will be very charitable.

493
00:43:44,417 --> 00:43:45,541
Ok.

494
00:43:46,458 --> 00:43:49,457
Bring the jar of dedication.

495
00:43:52,375 --> 00:43:53,541
Thank you.

496
00:43:54,375 --> 00:43:57,124
Put your good intention while pouring the water of dedication.

497
00:43:58,417 --> 00:44:07,416
Prayer

498
00:44:23,417 --> 00:44:26,374
- Hey!
- Thurs, I am back.

499
00:44:26,417 --> 00:44:29,416
love how you make merit for me.
Thank you very much.

500
00:44:30,375 --> 00:44:33,582
Hey Pao, how did you get in?

501
00:44:33,625 --> 00:44:38,499
I'm taking a shower. Don't do this again.

502
00:44:47,375 --> 00:44:48,541
Me likey.

503
00:44:49,417 --> 00:44:51,416
What?

504
00:44:54,458 --> 00:44:56,582
Stop playing.

505
00:45:00,458 --> 00:45:01,541
Me like.

506
00:45:03,583 --> 00:45:06,541
You will want it, right?!

507
00:45:07,542 --> 00:45:10,416
You want it?

508
00:45:11,458 --> 00:45:12,582
like...

509
00:45:21,375 --> 00:45:22,541
What have you been doing?

510
00:45:22,583 --> 00:45:24,541
Why...

511
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:27,416
your face doesn't look pale anymore.

512
00:45:27,583 --> 00:45:30,457
It's the merit you made for me this morning.

513
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:32,499
So we got a little better.

514
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:36,541
And, I unlocked another one.

515
00:45:37,417 --> 00:45:38,541
Really?

516
00:45:38,625 --> 00:45:41,624
So what level are you now? What you can do?

517
00:45:42,417 --> 00:45:43,541
Umm...

518
00:45:44,375 --> 00:45:47,624
Can go outside. More resistant to light.

519
00:45:50,458 --> 00:45:51,499
Good...

520
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:55,499
- So today, let's go on a trip.
- A trip?

521
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:59,374
I like it.

522
00:45:59,417 --> 00:46:01,457
I'll get dressed up first.

523
00:46:02,375 --> 00:46:03,499
Let me help.

524
00:46:03,542 --> 00:46:07,541
- You don't have to. Be here.
- I can help.

525
00:46:32,625 --> 00:46:35,541
Wait a minute..

526
00:46:36,375 --> 00:46:38,541
- I'll buy clothes for you to change.
- Umm.

527
00:46:38,583 --> 00:46:41,416
Pao, which one you like. You can tell me.

528
00:46:41,583 --> 00:46:43,582
And then..

529
00:46:44,542 --> 00:46:49,499
But... must only be the one that's on sale.

530
00:46:51,458 --> 00:46:53,541
And I'll buy one set for a start.

531
00:46:53,583 --> 00:47:01,499
- If you help us earn money. I will buy more.
- Yes, but...

532
00:47:01,625 --> 00:47:05,457
I don't want to choose.
If you'd like me to wear which one,

533
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:06,624
you can choose for me.

534
00:47:09,417 --> 00:47:11,541
Only if you insist...

535
00:47:12,542 --> 00:47:14,624
Ah this..

536
00:47:15,417 --> 00:47:16,457
This one is better.

537
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:21,541
Put this outside and this inside. And the pants.

538
00:47:24,625 --> 00:47:31,499
I think something is missing.

539
00:47:32,458 --> 00:47:34,416
Umm...

540
00:47:35,625 --> 00:47:38,624
Hey, this one...

541
00:47:40,583 --> 00:47:43,457
Do you want it?

542
00:47:44,458 --> 00:47:46,582
Let's go pay.

543
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:08,582
Hey...

544
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:13,582
Pao.

545
00:48:13,625 --> 00:48:15,541
Oh...

546
00:48:16,375 --> 00:48:18,541
Huh...

547
00:48:20,375 --> 00:48:23,416
How do you like this set?

548
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:27,416
Um, I like it, I like this set.

549
00:48:27,542 --> 00:48:30,499
Can you say anything else? You can't like everything.

550
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:33,541
Other opinions...

551
00:48:33,583 --> 00:48:35,624
like other people do.

552
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:42,624
I'm not people. My thoughts isn't complicated.

553
00:48:43,375 --> 00:48:46,457
Communicate what you feel.

554
00:48:49,583 --> 00:48:53,499
Ah, sorry.

555
00:48:54,583 --> 00:48:56,624
I don’t mean that.

556
00:48:57,458 --> 00:48:58,541
Umm...

557
00:48:58,625 --> 00:49:03,416
Let's go in. I want to put this in place.

558
00:49:03,625 --> 00:49:07,499
Well... I can't enter.

559
00:49:08,583 --> 00:49:10,374
Why?

560
00:49:11,458 --> 00:49:13,457
He did not let me in.

561
00:49:15,625 --> 00:49:17,499
Which he?

562
00:49:18,583 --> 00:49:20,499
He who is guarding.

563
00:49:24,583 --> 00:49:30,499
Oh, but why you can go to our dormitory or

564
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:33,499
to the mall?

565
00:49:33,542 --> 00:49:36,624
I can only get into some places, but

566
00:49:37,417 --> 00:49:40,457
a very sacred place, I can't get in.

567
00:49:48,542 --> 00:49:50,374
Ok.

568
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:52,499
- So let's go to another place.
- Um.

569
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:54,582
- But wait, I’ll put this in.
- Um.

570
00:49:57,458 --> 00:49:58,582
Hurry up...

571
00:50:24,375 --> 00:50:27,499
- Are you ok, Thurs?
- Um...

572
00:50:30,375 --> 00:50:33,499
Why people here look at me strangely?

573
00:50:37,375 --> 00:50:38,541
Umm...

574
00:50:39,417 --> 00:50:41,457
They probably saw you talking alone.

575
00:50:41,583 --> 00:50:45,416
Hey... that's true.

576
00:50:47,375 --> 00:50:48,541
All because of you.

577
00:50:49,458 --> 00:50:52,624
Keep walking quietly, don't you know?

578
00:50:53,583 --> 00:50:55,582
I do not to be here.

579
00:50:56,417 --> 00:50:59,624
- Thurs?
- Told you to keep quiet.

580
00:51:00,375 --> 00:51:01,582
Don't jump.

581
00:51:02,375 --> 00:51:05,499
Someone will jump to suicide. Help him now.

582
00:51:05,583 --> 00:51:08,457
Where? Is it true?

583
00:51:08,458 --> 00:51:09,582
Don't jump!

584
00:51:09,583 --> 00:51:12,624
- Over there
- After you.

585
00:51:16,458 --> 00:51:19,624
Brother, don't jump.

586
00:51:20,375 --> 00:51:21,541
Don't jump.

587
00:51:21,583 --> 00:51:26,457
- I don't want to live.
- Don't, don't, don't you...

588
00:51:35,542 --> 00:51:37,541
Did you just know the future?

589
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:42,374
A little.

590
00:51:48,458 --> 00:51:53,416
I think it's time for you to work.
- Work?

591
00:51:54,458 --> 00:51:56,582
I like it.

592
00:51:57,458 --> 00:51:59,582
But what kind of work?

593
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:03,499
You’ll know.

594
00:52:03,583 --> 00:52:05,416
But..

595
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:09,499
- Wait, I have to test you first.
- Um. Let's do it.

596
00:52:15,417 --> 00:52:16,541
So...

597
00:52:17,417 --> 00:52:21,416
you see the woman behind there?

598
00:52:22,375 --> 00:52:24,457
Oh, yes.

599
00:52:24,583 --> 00:52:26,582
Pao, try to guess

600
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:30,457
what will happen to this woman.

601
00:52:35,458 --> 00:52:37,457
She will drop her pen.

602
00:52:42,375 --> 00:52:43,541
She did.

603
00:52:44,542 --> 00:52:48,499
- Another one. Just in case, to be sure.
- OK.

604
00:52:52,542 --> 00:52:58,374
- That guy talking on the phone over there?
- That guy...

605
00:52:58,375 --> 00:53:01,499
Tell me..

606
00:53:01,542 --> 00:53:03,541
what did he do last night?

607
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:06,541
And who are you talking with now?

608
00:53:06,583 --> 00:53:11,499
And now what will happen to him?

609
00:53:15,625 --> 00:53:17,541
He went out last night.

610
00:53:17,625 --> 00:53:22,541
He's talking to the woman he met last night.

611
00:53:22,542 --> 00:53:26,457
And, his real girlfriend will appear

612
00:53:26,625 --> 00:53:30,416
and then they will have a big fight.

613
00:53:37,375 --> 00:53:38,541
- Oops.
- Oops.

614
00:53:44,458 --> 00:53:45,582
Oh!

615
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:50,457
Amazing!

616
00:53:50,542 --> 00:53:54,499
Is there anything else for me to predict?

617
00:54:00,542 --> 00:54:02,499
No more!

618
00:54:21,542 --> 00:54:22,624
Ouch!

619
00:54:27,583 --> 00:54:30,624
What are you laughing at?

620
00:54:38,542 --> 00:54:40,541
Hey, you must know, right?

621
00:54:40,583 --> 00:54:44,416
- I was going to be thrown with paper?
- I know.

622
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:47,582
Then why didn't you tell me?

623
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:52,541
Sorry, you didn't tell me to.

624
00:54:53,417 --> 00:54:55,416
Am I wrong?

625
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:57,541
Well, I didn't mean that.

626
00:54:57,583 --> 00:54:59,541
OK...

627
00:55:00,625 --> 00:55:02,457
Thurs?

628
00:55:02,625 --> 00:55:04,457
I'm sorry.

629
00:55:08,583 --> 00:55:11,416
Will you really not forgive me?

630
00:55:19,542 --> 00:55:21,499
I apologize.

631
00:55:23,458 --> 00:55:25,416
Forgive me.

632
00:55:31,458 --> 00:55:33,457
Ugh.

633
00:55:33,583 --> 00:55:36,541
- It's forgiven.
- Really?

634
00:55:37,375 --> 00:55:38,499
Umm...

635
00:55:38,625 --> 00:55:44,582
But in the future you have to tell me about what will happen.

636
00:55:45,417 --> 00:55:46,499
Ok.

637
00:55:47,375 --> 00:55:48,499
Me likey.

638
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:52,416
Very good. I like it.

639
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:57,416
- Let me see? Where did you get hit? - Right here.

640
00:55:57,417 --> 00:55:58,457
- Ooh...

641
00:55:58,458 --> 00:56:02,457
- It's so much pain.
- There's a stain too.

642
00:56:02,458 --> 00:56:06,416
What is this stain? Stained paper?
