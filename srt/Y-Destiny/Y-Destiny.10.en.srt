1
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:06,060
Love.

2
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:06,079
Miss.
Love.

3
00:00:06,079 --> 00:00:07,100
Miss.

4
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:08,180
Don't forget

5
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:11,060
that we are not together.

6
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:15,980
Puth, take care of Payu too.

7
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:17,100
Are you okay?

8
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:19,980
I think I fell in love with him.

9
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,999
Are you okay?

10
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:00,999
Wanna know the feeling of dating. How they do?

11
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:06,159
Okay, I'll arrange it.

12
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,159
P'Payu?

13
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,039
Good luck with the class.

14
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,199
Um, thank you.

15
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,079
Puth.

16
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,039
Damn! Kaeng!

17
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,999
Don't be noisy.

18
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,999
Everyone can hear us now.

19
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,199
Why are you here?

20
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,239
Substituting a teacher. He's sick.

21
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:09,039
Actually I miss you.

22
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,199
What are you doing?

23
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,999
No one here.

24
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,159
Well, whom do you like?

25
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,199
Show me.

26
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,199
He is teaching.

27
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,079
When you're done, go back with me.

28
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,239
I'm not going back.

29
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,119
I'll eat with P'Payu.

30
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,119
I'll go too.

31
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,119
No, you're not.

32
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,039
P'Payu.

33
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,199
Let's go eat.

34
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,039
Go eat?

35
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,039
Can I go too?

36
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:11,039
Can I call you Burden?

37
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,039
Kaeng.

38
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,159
It's Payu. Physics and chemistry tutor.

39
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,119
Nice to meet you.

40
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,159
Nice to meet you too.

41
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,239
I'm sorry, I got the name wrong.

42
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,039
Let's go to the same restaurant.

43
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,199
Let's have pork barbecue.

44
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,199
OK?

45
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,199
I'm not going.

46
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,199
Don't want to stink.

47
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,039
Same restaurant.

48
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,079
P'Payu, what do you think?

49
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,039
I want to eat pork barbecue.

50
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,079
Please... I want to have barbecue.

51
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:25,159
Ok, it's been quite some time for me.

52
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,999
Ruth, please?

53
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:35,999
Ok.

54
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,199
So, let's go eat, shall we?

55
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,159
Ok.

56
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,119
Yes.

57
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,119
P'Payu?

58
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:25,039
P'Payu, you know here was a special place.

59
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,079
Yes.

60
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:39,119
Only special people get to be here.

61
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:51,999
Kaeng.

62
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,039
Shut it.

63
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,079
And eat.

64
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,119
Why?

65
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,999
I always serve you.

66
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:14,999
When he was around, you got embarrassed?

67
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,159
Who's embarrassed?

68
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,199
I'm not embarrassed.

69
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,239
If you are not, eat.

70
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,999
Very good.

71
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,199
You guys look very close.

72
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,239
- No.
- Yes.

73
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,159
Yes, we are very close.

74
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,119
Actually, we are almost together.

75
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:13,039
Even our friends like to tease us that

76
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:20,159
we are inseparable like fat and meat.

77
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,159
I wanna puke.

78
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,079
What is this shit?

79
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:44,159
I think you two are funny.

80
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:50,039
If you don't insist you're are friends, I thought that Kaeng is eyeing Puth.

81
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,999
Uh, it burns, should we change the stove?

82
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:11,199
Stove has changes,

83
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:16,119
but my love will not change.

84
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:24,159
I like it, this joke.

85
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,159
Right?

86
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,119
Don't you think, Puth?

87
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:33,079
Kaeng means love as a friend.

88
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,999
Enough, I'm full and

89
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,039
Kaeng,

90
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,039
I'll send you off?

91
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,039
I'll be quick to talk to P'Payu.

92
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:18,180
Kaeng, give it to me.

93
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,060
I won't.

94
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,399
Here's my number.

95
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,439
Don't forget to call me tonight.

96
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:48,599
Yes.

97
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,399
Thank you, P'Payu.

98
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:02,399
So, shall we go home?

99
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:10,399
It's okay. You take care of your friend.

100
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,519
Ok.

101
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,559
You're leaving?

102
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,559
Yes, see you later.

103
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,479
Hello.

104
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,479
So you're satisfied now?

105
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,559
Let's go. I'll send you.

106
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,359
OK.

107
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,559
I'll hurry back to talk to P'Payu.

108
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,559
Go.

109
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,519
Kaeng, give it to me.

110
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,399
I won't.

111
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,559
Gimme.

112
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,479
I said I won't give you.

113
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,559
Hey!

114
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,519
Puth.

115
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,479
Tonight you sleep with me.

116
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,399
I'm not.

117
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,559
Are you sure

118
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,599
that you can resist.

119
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,479
Will you give it easily?

120
00:16:55,560 --> 00:17:01,399
If you won't, I'll get off right now.

121
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,559
Then I'll go send you at your room.

122
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,599
You can be fast to talk to him.

123
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,359
Yes!

124
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,439
Hello.

125
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,359
Are you home yet?

126
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,599
Yes, I am.

127
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,399
- What about Puth?
- I'm home.

128
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,479
P'Payu?

129
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,599
Let's go to the movies some days?

130
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:11,439
Yes, when you're both free.

131
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,519
See you.

132
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,599
Okay, P'Payu.

133
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,439
- Good night.
- Good night.

134
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,439
Mon.

135
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,399
Oohhhh.

136
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,359
So sweet.

137
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,439
Hey, are you eavesdropping?

138
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,519
Bad manner!

139
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:48,519
I don't have to eavesdrop. You're so loud.

140
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,519
If Thurs was in medium, he can hear you.

141
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,439
But you're such a player.

142
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,479
Just got his number and then asked him to movies.

143
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,479
After the movies, you

144
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,399
What is it?

145
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,399
You're an ass.

146
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,479
I'm not like your P'Team.

147
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:20,399
Oh, after my first movie with P'Team, we...

148
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,479
What is it?

149
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:27,599
I remember how you didn't lock the door and Kaeng came in.

150
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,599
Kaeng came to see you?

151
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:41,599
Kaeng? I mean Kaen the fifth-floor dude?

152
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,559
He was drunk and knocked on the wrong door.

153
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,359
Yes!

154
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,599
So did he do something to you?

155
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,479
I said

156
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:01,399
Go do your homework.

157
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:05,519
Go!

158
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,519
Now you are invincible.

159
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,439
I do. I have a boyfriend.

160
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,479
Hey.

161
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,399
I'm going to tell P'Team this.

162
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,399
Go for it.

163
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,519
P'Puth?

164
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,479
P'Puth?

165
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:01,519
This again. Little smile, big smile.

166
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,359
You're quite in a mood.

167
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,519
What?

168
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,519
Why are you carping me?

169
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,599
Can't I just have a good mood?

170
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,599
Hey, Team.

171
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,559
Why is your face so bright?

172
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,399
True that.

173
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,479
- Really?
- Umm.

174
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:38,399
Are you in love?

175
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,359
No, you're crazy.

176
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,599
Someone like me is in love?

177
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,519
Who'd be in love with someone like me?

178
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,479
Bye, guys.

179
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:16,399
I'll go now.

180
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,439
The weather here is not good at all.

181
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:30,479
I'll go talk to P'Payu as well.

182
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,519
Later.

183
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,599
- Bye-bye, P'Puth.
- Bye.

184
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,359
P'Payu?

185
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,559
Are you tired?

186
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,599
I'm chill.

187
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,559
Water for you.

188
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,519
Is there anything...

189
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,439
Good luck on the class.

190
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:11,519
Yes.

191
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:17,359
So I won't bothering you.

192
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,519
Don't want to sleep with you.

193
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,559
Don't make me hate you more.

194
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,199
Why are you here?

195
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:13,279
I miss you...

196
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:16,159
Can't I come here?!

197
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,239
But I don't miss you

198
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:40,119
and I don't want to sleep with you.

199
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,159
Go back.

200
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:28,359
Don't make me hate you more.

201
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,319
Okay...

202
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,279
I will go.

203
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:43,279
Several weeks later...

204
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:06,119
I have something to tell you today.

205
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,279
Kaeng...

206
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:23,359
I think we should take a break from all these things for a while.

207
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,319
Why...

208
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:46,119
Are you bored of me?

209
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,199
I'm not

210
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:53,159
I'm just...

211
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,199
don't want to do anything like this.

212
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:00,159
I guess I'm falling in love.

213
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:11,159
With who?

214
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:15,119
It's a tutor.

215
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:17,319
The new tutor.

216
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:29,239
But now you and him are not together yet.

217
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,319
I'll try with him, it will take a while.

218
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:43,319
Then I ask him to be my boyfriend.

219
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,279
So if that day is coming,

220
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:08,239
can you tell me in advance?

221
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,359
Okay...

222
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,319
Why?

223
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:26,199
So I can prepare...

224
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:37,239
Whatever I have to do to not to call you when I want to!

225
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,239
What the fuck is this about?

226
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,319
Don't say anything now Puth.

227
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,239
Eat first...

228
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:58,159
I did my best.

229
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,279
I am fulfilling the promise.

230
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,319
Just wanna tell you that...

231
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,279
tomorrow..

232
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:35,199
I'm going to ask him to be my boyfriend.

233
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:13,239
And then we would....

234
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:17,119
not be together like this anymore, right?

235
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:26,119
But... you and I are friends all the same.

236
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,359
We just can't sleep together.

237
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,239
But what are you afraid of?

238
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,079
Someone like you...

239
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:50,119
people come and go.

240
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:06,279
Some other people...

241
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:10,239
A hundred of them like me...

242
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:16,159
But I only have one person

243
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:20,239
who is special for me.

244
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:26,159
Do you understand me?

245
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:33,239
Why all romantic now?

246
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:42,359
Do you know that

247
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:45,199
you are very flirty...

248
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:48,359
I'm very flirty

249
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,279
Can we just stop like this?

250
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:01,159
If I said I'd stop...

251
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,359
With whom?

252
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:14,159
No one.

253
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:17,239
I don't know what I'm saying.

254
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:23,119
People like me

255
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:26,199
would want to start over with someone?

256
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,159
So...

257
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:41,319
I'm glad that you're exclusive with someone.

258
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,319
Um...

259
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:54,199
So that what I want to tell you.

260
00:38:54,200 --> 00:39:01,239
Damn, Puth!

261
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:23,279
Can I ask for something?...

262
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:32,359
Can you pretend to be my boyfriend?

263
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,159
I beg you!

264
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:58,199
Just stay with me...

265
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:04,319
I want to remember this feeling.

266
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:12,279
We don't have to sleep together.

267
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:22,279
Can you do this for me for one last time?

268
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:33,199
I beg you!

269
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:54,159
Kaeng...

270
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,279
You...

271
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:11,159
You want to do me for the last time?

272
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:20,239
Are you really wanting me to do it?

273
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,239
Um...

274
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:11,239
You don't have to let me do it.

275
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:19,239
Just stay in your arms,

276
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:23,119
I'm satisfied.

277
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:05,199
Puth!

278
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:08,159
Sorry, I'm late, let's go!

279
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:21,239
P'Payu.

280
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,239
I think...

281
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:29,159
You are not my 'right time' yet.

282
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:36,159
I'm really sorry. P'Payu.

283
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:39,039
Hey, why are you sorry?

284
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:41,239
We are brothers since the start, aren't we?

285
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:48,199
So you invited me out to break up with me?

286
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:51,239
Thought you'd ask me to be your boyfriend.

287
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:55,079
And...

288
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:58,039
P'Payu, aren't you sad or

289
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:01,039
angry at me for a bit?

290
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:04,039
I feel that right now...

291
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:06,999
is not the right time for me either, Puth.

292
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:10,079
The right time for me now

293
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:13,079
should be more about work.

294
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:21,159
But I'm glad you're honest with your feelings.

295
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:28,039
So you know who is your right person at this right time.

296
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:30,239
He that is for you now, Puth.

297
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:34,079
Yes...

298
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:36,999
Then I said that Puth must go find him.

299
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,199
Sometimes he might wait for you.

300
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:44,159
Yes...

301
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:48,039
Fighting!

302
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:53,999
So... Excuse me.

303
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:03,079
Good luck, Puth.

304
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:12,159
Nice ring tone.

305
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:17,119
Did you put it up for me?

306
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:36,199
Why did you come to me?

307
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:40,079
I said that we will not meet again!

308
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:46,239
Just want to ask

309
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:52,159
that your only special one,

310
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:56,239
is it me?

311
00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:00,719
If not...

312
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:03,199
I'll go.

313
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:12,159
You did remember what I said?

314
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:20,039
I remember everything.

315
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:25,119
And I also know...

316
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:28,159
That you have changed!

317
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:33,159
What did I do?

318
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:36,239
Have you ever noticed me

319
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:39,239
to know that I have changed?

320
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:52,119
At first...

321
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:55,199
I don't care

322
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:04,239
But I really can't help but wonder.

323
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:10,199
When I see your gesture

324
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:14,119
your eyes

325
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:18,039
when you look at me.

326
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:43,159
It's like you have me in there.

327
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:56,239
so confused.

328
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:07,999
I'm so confused that Mon can't stand me.

329
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:12,999
So he came to confess to me.

330
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:18,119
That you

331
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:21,079
was the one who tells him to...

332
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:24,039
find out what type of people I like.

333
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:28,999
So you can change to become my type.

334
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:34,159
You have...

335
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:38,119
no decency, no stand at all.

336
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:48,239
You give up yourself, for me?

337
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:17,999
So the right person...

338
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:20,159
Is it me?

339
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:30,159
It's you, why are you asking the obvious?

340
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:37,239
So...

341
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:42,239
Aren't you going to be his boyfriend?

342
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:01,079
What's this...

343
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:08,119
No.

344
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:13,119
I think...

345
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:19,119
I don't like smart people.

346
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:23,159
I like the people who makes me comfy.

347
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:28,039
Wait..

348
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:31,039
are you saying I'm stupid?

349
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:36,239
Not like that.

350
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:47,159
I can be stupid...

351
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:50,039
but just for you only.

352
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:01,239
Kaeng...

353
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:09,199
From now on...

354
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:15,039
I'm not letting you sleep around.

355
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:21,079
That applies to me too...

356
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:27,079
ever since... we first did it months ago?

357
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,039
As for you...

358
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:33,199
I forbid it!

359
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:46,119
didn't sleep with anyone else

360
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:50,239
since you got me back then.

361
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:28,119
I have a boyfriend.

362
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:31,079
- I have a boyfriend.
- Hey, Kaeng.

363
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:33,199
I have a boyfriend.

364
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:36,079
- My boyfriend's name is Puth.
- Hey...

365
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:38,119
My boyfriend's name is Puth...

366
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:40,199
I have a boyfriend too.

367
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:43,159
His name is Kaeng.

368
00:57:11,120 --> 00:57:14,199
I feel like you and I are drifting apart.

369
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:16,079
Will it be ok

370
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:20,719
if I wish you and I go back to be close friends?

371
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:24,639
For me, Sat would always be my closest friend.

372
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:27,079
You still keep pictures of the two of us?

373
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:30,159
If you kiss me again, I won't be your friend anymore.
