1
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:51,819
Don't go yet. I wanna apply.

2
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:56,819
If you want to be a good boxer, you'd have to believe me.

3
00:00:58,237 --> 00:00:59,028
Why did you take such good care of me?

4
00:00:59,945 --> 00:01:03,028
If I wasn't sick, I'd probably already be yours.

5
00:01:09,029 --> 00:01:09,986
Come here.

6
00:01:18,029 --> 00:01:19,819
What are you doing?

7
00:01:19,945 --> 00:01:23,819
Put it on and don't take it off.

8
00:01:26,945 --> 00:01:27,944
What is this?

9
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:29,986
It's a kid's tracker

10
00:01:30,945 --> 00:01:33,028
so I'll know where you are.

11
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:34,861
But I'm not a kid anymore.

12
00:01:35,029 --> 00:01:39,903
Shut it. Since I didn't go, you've been lousy.

13
00:01:41,029 --> 00:01:42,819
What's your problem?

14
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:44,819
I've never been lousy.

15
00:01:45,987 --> 00:01:46,944
Go, now.

16
00:01:47,904 --> 00:01:48,944
Hey, are you jealous?

17
00:01:52,987 --> 00:01:55,986
Who's jealous? Go run, now.

18
00:01:57,987 --> 00:01:58,944
And you take a rest.

19
00:02:03,029 --> 00:02:03,944
Yes!

20
00:02:05,945 --> 00:02:06,903
Later, then.

21
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:35,028
Come. Follow me.

22
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:44,819
Why didn't you accept my call?

23
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:48,861
Well, I was running, right?

24
00:02:49,862 --> 00:02:50,819
Where are you?

25
00:02:50,945 --> 00:02:54,903
You can check, right Why are you asking me?

26
00:02:57,904 --> 00:03:02,028
Well, I can but I want to hear from you.

27
00:03:02,904 --> 00:03:03,903
You miss me?

28
00:03:07,029 --> 00:03:10,944
I just called to see if you really are running

29
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,819
or you've taken off your watch and set it aside.

30
00:03:13,945 --> 00:03:15,903
I'm not that bad.

31
00:03:17,987 --> 00:03:19,819
Can you hang up?

32
00:03:20,904 --> 00:03:22,069
You'll stop running when I hang up.

33
00:03:22,945 --> 00:03:24,028
You want to know, right?

34
00:03:26,862 --> 00:03:27,861
Look at this.

35
00:03:31,945 --> 00:03:33,986
WTF, what are you doing?

36
00:03:37,862 --> 00:03:45,028
I'm messing with you. If you can only see your face, so awkward.

37
00:03:47,904 --> 00:03:49,028
I was never handsome.

38
00:03:50,904 --> 00:03:52,069
But you're handsome for me.

39
00:03:58,904 --> 00:03:59,944
What are you trying to say?

40
00:04:00,987 --> 00:04:03,028
I'll keep running

41
00:04:19,987 --> 00:04:22,069
Tue, here's your food.

42
00:04:23,987 --> 00:04:24,944
Thank you.

43
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:27,819
Join us.

44
00:04:27,987 --> 00:04:28,861
Ok.

45
00:04:35,904 --> 00:04:36,819
How are you practice?

46
00:04:37,987 --> 00:04:42,069
It's good but Kong want to have me running this week.

47
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:47,861
And are you ready?

48
00:04:49,904 --> 00:04:50,944
Not really.

49
00:04:53,862 --> 00:04:55,903
Don't be afraid, I'll practice with you.

50
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,819
How'd you do that? Won't you wanna help yourself first?

51
00:05:00,945 --> 00:05:06,028
You just practice and keep the video open.

52
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:09,069
You really think so?

53
00:05:10,904 --> 00:05:11,903
Will it work?

54
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:15,028
Just try, believe me.

55
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:21,903
Fine, I'll try.

56
00:05:43,862 --> 00:05:46,069
Ake, sleep already.

57
00:05:47,029 --> 00:05:48,944
If I don't confiscate your phone, you won't sleep.

58
00:05:49,029 --> 00:05:52,944
I know. One more round and I'll sleep.

59
00:06:04,862 --> 00:06:06,861
Here's your phone.

60
00:06:09,945 --> 00:06:10,861
Go to sleep now.

61
00:06:11,904 --> 00:06:12,861
Yes, sir.

62
00:06:16,029 --> 00:06:16,944
Good night.

63
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:33,028
Good night.

64
00:06:35,987 --> 00:06:36,944
Good night.

65
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,069
Good night.

66
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:04,236
Are you okay, Tue?

67
00:08:04,445 --> 00:08:05,319
I'm itchy.

68
00:08:09,362 --> 00:08:10,444
Itchy that much?

69
00:08:11,404 --> 00:08:12,403
Yeah.

70
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:14,319
When did the itching start?

71
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,403
Been a while.

72
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:21,319
Why don't you tell me?

73
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:24,278
was being considerate.

74
00:08:27,237 --> 00:08:30,278
Now I can't scratch for you.

75
00:08:32,404 --> 00:08:33,444
It will make a scar.

76
00:08:34,195 --> 00:08:35,319
So you're gonna let me itch like this?

77
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:42,361
No scratch but I can blow for you.

78
00:09:22,237 --> 00:09:23,319
Did I make you tingle?

79
00:09:26,404 --> 00:09:27,403
Okay now?

80
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,236
I think

81
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:42,403
it's enough for tonight.

82
00:09:46,237 --> 00:09:47,444
But I can't stand it anymore.

83
00:09:55,404 --> 00:09:56,403
You go to the bathroom, now.

84
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,278
Tue.

85
00:10:32,404 --> 00:10:33,278
Wake up.

86
00:10:35,445 --> 00:10:37,236
Come and take the medicine.

87
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,319
Tue get up to take the medicine now.

88
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,236
Get up.

89
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,236
Open your mouth. Take medicine.

90
00:11:08,195 --> 00:11:09,278
Water.

91
00:12:05,195 --> 00:12:06,403
Wake up and take another round of pills.

92
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,403
Tue, get up and took some medicine quickly.

93
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,236
Come quickly, come quickly, let's eat.

94
00:13:43,237 --> 00:13:43,819
Where are you, Ake?

95
00:13:45,404 --> 00:13:46,444
your mind.

96
00:13:49,237 --> 00:13:52,403
Don't fuck with me. Run.

97
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,444
Or your heart just don't have me in it, Tue?

98
00:13:59,487 --> 00:14:00,278
I told you to go run.

99
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:05,278
Answer me. Do you have me in your heart?

100
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,319
Yes

101
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,236
Are you satisfied?

102
00:14:12,404 --> 00:14:13,278
Go run now.

103
00:14:15,404 --> 00:14:16,444
Coach Tue.

104
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,278
Tue, eat!

105
00:14:40,404 --> 00:14:41,236
I know.

106
00:14:50,237 --> 00:14:51,278
Are you okay?

107
00:14:51,445 --> 00:14:53,319
You're like someone who gave up on the world.

108
00:14:56,445 --> 00:14:58,236
I'm bored.

109
00:15:00,237 --> 00:15:03,319
Tired of food, bored of this.

110
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,194
I don't get to go anywhere like other people.

111
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,319
Do you want to stop being bored?

112
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,236
How?

113
00:15:20,404 --> 00:15:21,194
Yes!

114
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,319
Tue, this is yours.

115
00:15:35,237 --> 00:15:40,403
This is bad. I'm the assistant coach but I'm ditching.

116
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:49,236
Why are you telling me now? Why didn't you say before we got out?

117
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,403
Why is your coach spirit working now?

118
00:15:56,237 --> 00:15:57,278
I'm afraid...

119
00:15:58,404 --> 00:16:01,319
I was the assistant coach, but I'm here doing wrong.

120
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:09,403
What's so wrong? Just out for food and chill.

121
00:16:13,362 --> 00:16:17,319
Fine. Let's finish it and go back.

122
00:16:19,362 --> 00:16:20,319
I don't want Kong to see us.

123
00:16:37,445 --> 00:16:39,194
Eat all of them.

124
00:17:00,362 --> 00:17:05,278
How's it? Is this place nice?

125
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:10,236
It's okay, I feel so much better.

126
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:23,319
Is this where you sneak out when I nap?

127
00:17:24,404 --> 00:17:26,236
And who did you come here with?

128
00:17:28,737 --> 00:17:30,194
Tue.

129
00:17:32,404 --> 00:17:34,403
Can you stop coaching for a while?

130
00:17:37,404 --> 00:17:38,361
Please.

131
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,278
Please.

132
00:17:42,404 --> 00:17:43,236
Please.

133
00:17:46,237 --> 00:17:49,319
Okay.

134
00:17:59,404 --> 00:18:00,236
Tue.

135
00:18:02,404 --> 00:18:04,236
Why are you shaking so much?

136
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,361
Are you cold?

137
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,361
A little bit.

138
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,278
It's okay.

139
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:49,194
Ake, I said it's fine.

140
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,194
Tue.

141
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:02,361
I'm getting cold. Can I hug you?

142
00:19:53,529 --> 00:19:57,361
See, I told you, no one knows.

143
00:19:57,570 --> 00:19:59,444
Fuck!

144
00:19:59,445 --> 00:20:00,528
Big one too.

145
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,528
Where have the two of you gone?

146
00:20:17,529 --> 00:20:19,528
The two of you only make trouble.

147
00:20:20,445 --> 00:20:22,611
When you were fighting, you made up stories.

148
00:20:23,362 --> 00:20:25,444
Now that you're together, you ditch practice together.

149
00:20:26,487 --> 00:20:29,444
Tue, do you really want to be a coach?

150
00:20:29,529 --> 00:20:31,528
You don't even know right from wrong.

151
00:20:31,612 --> 00:20:35,444
You too. What happen to having discipline?

152
00:20:35,487 --> 00:20:37,403
Two of you must be punished.

153
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:42,528
No, brother Kong. If you're gonna punish us, only punish me.

154
00:20:43,487 --> 00:20:46,403
I was a coach, but I've made a mistake.

155
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:49,403
I have no excuse.

156
00:20:53,362 --> 00:20:54,403
Good.

157
00:20:55,362 --> 00:20:57,528
As a man, you must admit when you're wrong.

158
00:21:00,404 --> 00:21:01,444
Oh, brother.

159
00:21:02,404 --> 00:21:03,486
I'm sorry.

160
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:09,486
was behind all of this. And Tue was sick, too.

161
00:21:11,362 --> 00:21:12,528
What we've done,

162
00:21:14,404 --> 00:21:15,611
I'll redeem alone.

163
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:19,611
No, brother Kong.

164
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:21,611
I am a coach.

165
00:21:22,445 --> 00:21:24,569
If the team makes mistakes, it's the coach's fault.

166
00:21:26,362 --> 00:21:27,444
Punish me.

167
00:21:31,362 --> 00:21:33,486
Friendship is a good thing.

168
00:21:35,487 --> 00:21:36,403
is not time

169
00:21:36,529 --> 00:21:38,403
for friendship.

170
00:21:39,612 --> 00:21:42,403
And I've already figured out the penalty for you two.

171
00:21:43,612 --> 00:21:44,361
No.

172
00:21:44,487 --> 00:21:45,444
Ake,

173
00:21:45,529 --> 00:21:48,444
did you just say that you will be the liability?

174
00:21:48,445 --> 00:21:49,444
Yes, sir.

175
00:21:51,487 --> 00:21:52,486
If so...

176
00:21:53,445 --> 00:21:57,486
You write down these following words. I won't ask coach to ditch practice again.

177
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:01,444
One thousand lines and another thousand for him.

178
00:22:01,529 --> 00:22:03,361
All yours.

179
00:22:03,445 --> 00:22:06,403
Send them to me before morning run.

180
00:22:06,612 --> 00:22:08,403
I understand.

181
00:22:08,529 --> 00:22:11,611
But this punishment is very cute.

182
00:22:13,445 --> 00:22:16,403
Wait, I can even make it three thousand.

183
00:22:16,487 --> 00:22:18,403
You don't want to challenge Brother Kong.

184
00:22:18,404 --> 00:22:20,403
Well, it's not that hard, I'll be done soon.

185
00:22:20,445 --> 00:22:23,319
If you dare ask, I dare you three thousand.

186
00:22:23,487 --> 00:22:24,528
But Tue

187
00:22:25,445 --> 00:22:27,528
don't let me know you help him.

188
00:22:28,445 --> 00:22:30,528
Otherwise everything will be double.

189
00:22:31,445 --> 00:22:32,486
Yes, sir.

190
00:22:32,862 --> 00:22:33,528
I'll see you later.

191
00:22:42,445 --> 00:22:43,486
What are you doing?

192
00:22:46,404 --> 00:22:48,403
I'll go write. It won't take long.

193
00:23:02,487 --> 00:23:03,444
Ake.

194
00:23:04,404 --> 00:23:06,486
Ake! It's one hour and you can only write three hundred sentences.

195
00:23:06,529 --> 00:23:07,528
Huh!

196
00:23:08,487 --> 00:23:09,486
What?

197
00:23:10,445 --> 00:23:12,403
I've been doing this for so long.

198
00:23:12,445 --> 00:23:14,361
It's a long sentence.

199
00:23:16,529 --> 00:23:19,444
I told you not to challenge Brother Kong.

200
00:23:23,529 --> 00:23:25,528
What you think is the reasons behind this?

201
00:23:28,404 --> 00:23:29,444
How do you know?

202
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:34,403
That time is precious.
I'd have use this time to rest or practice.

203
00:23:34,529 --> 00:23:39,486
You'd be leading but now here being punished.

204
00:23:43,529 --> 00:23:46,403
So profound, Bro Kong.

205
00:23:48,529 --> 00:23:50,444
How many hours do I have?

206
00:23:54,404 --> 00:23:55,403
Five hours.

207
00:23:55,445 --> 00:23:56,486
Five?

208
00:23:57,445 --> 00:23:59,319
Have to hurry. Sprint!

209
00:24:00,445 --> 00:24:03,403
Tue, please make coffee for me.

210
00:24:03,612 --> 00:24:04,528
'Kay.

211
00:24:05,404 --> 00:24:06,444
Be right back.

212
00:24:06,529 --> 00:24:07,528
Thank you.

213
00:24:22,404 --> 00:24:23,403
Come here.

214
00:24:23,487 --> 00:24:24,486
I'll help you.

215
00:24:24,612 --> 00:24:29,611
Brother Kong won't let you help me. I don't wanna do more lines.

216
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,611
It's okay. I'll make the handwriting very convincing.

217
00:24:33,445 --> 00:24:36,444
Squiggly handwriting like this, is easy to copy.

218
00:25:08,404 --> 00:25:09,486
Finished.

219
00:25:12,529 --> 00:25:15,403
You took it to Kong.

220
00:25:18,612 --> 00:25:21,528
I thank you very much. That you help me

221
00:25:23,487 --> 00:25:24,486
It's okay.

222
00:25:27,612 --> 00:25:30,486
I'll bring it in. I'll be back.

223
00:25:42,487 --> 00:25:45,403
Brother Kong, here.

224
00:25:45,487 --> 00:25:46,486
What?

225
00:25:53,487 --> 00:25:55,444
What have you learn from this?

226
00:25:55,612 --> 00:25:56,528
Time is precious.

227
00:25:57,404 --> 00:25:59,444
We should use it carefully.

228
00:25:59,487 --> 00:26:01,403
Break time should be taken seriously.

229
00:26:01,445 --> 00:26:03,319
Rules should not be break.

230
00:26:06,529 --> 00:26:07,486
Okay...

231
00:26:07,487 --> 00:26:11,319
I hope after this I'll see you focus on practicing more.

232
00:26:11,487 --> 00:26:12,486
Yes, Bro Kong.

233
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:17,528
Brother Kong, can I hug you?

234
00:26:17,529 --> 00:26:18,444
Huh!

235
00:26:21,529 --> 00:26:22,528
Okay.

236
00:26:25,404 --> 00:26:26,486
Fighting!

237
00:26:29,445 --> 00:26:32,444
Club representative selection date!

238
00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:42,486
Ake.

239
00:26:44,487 --> 00:26:45,611
Are you ready?

240
00:26:46,487 --> 00:26:48,403
Not really.

241
00:27:04,404 --> 00:27:05,528
You don't have to be afraid.

242
00:27:06,529 --> 00:27:08,319
I believe

243
00:27:08,487 --> 00:27:09,528
that you can do it.

244
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:17,611
I just want my father to come cheer me.

245
00:27:34,445 --> 00:27:35,486
What is this?

246
00:27:36,487 --> 00:27:38,444
Cheering you up.

247
00:27:51,362 --> 00:27:52,486
Even my hug

248
00:27:54,404 --> 00:27:56,486
may not be as encouraging as your father's.

249
00:27:58,487 --> 00:28:00,403
But I'm a boxer too.

250
00:28:03,404 --> 00:28:04,528
That should be enough to substitute his hug.

251
00:28:22,487 --> 00:28:24,403
You can substitute him

252
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:28,611
Because you are my godfather.

253
00:28:57,529 --> 00:28:58,528
See you later.

254
00:30:30,737 --> 00:30:31,944
I'm on the balcony next to the practice building.

255
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:33,736
Ake.

256
00:30:35,862 --> 00:30:36,903
Ake.

257
00:30:53,904 --> 00:30:55,736
I'm sorry.

258
00:30:57,862 --> 00:30:59,819
I'm not a good coach.

259
00:31:01,862 --> 00:31:03,736
Now you have to lose.

260
00:31:07,945 --> 00:31:09,861
Don't blame yourself.

261
00:31:12,904 --> 00:31:14,819
You are the best coach

262
00:31:16,737 --> 00:31:17,861
I've ever met.

263
00:31:23,737 --> 00:31:24,903
If I was a really good coach,

264
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:27,944
you'd not lose.

265
00:31:33,987 --> 00:31:35,903
Did I told you

266
00:31:37,904 --> 00:31:38,986
that I've lost?

267
00:31:39,945 --> 00:31:41,819
What do you mean?

268
00:31:43,945 --> 00:31:45,736
Did you win?

269
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:58,736
So if you win,

270
00:32:01,779 --> 00:32:02,944
why are you still so sad?

271
00:32:06,945 --> 00:32:08,861
I'm just confused.

272
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:14,819
I feel something special with someone

273
00:32:17,737 --> 00:32:18,861
but I think

274
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:21,736
that it would not be possible.

275
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:29,944
I understand you

276
00:32:31,945 --> 00:32:33,861
because I feel that way too.

277
00:32:33,945 --> 00:32:35,819
Who is it?

278
00:32:37,029 --> 00:32:38,819
Can you tell me?

279
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:44,903
You don't wanna know.

280
00:32:50,904 --> 00:32:51,861
Tue.

281
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:01,986
Can you tell me

282
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:06,819
that you have feeling

283
00:33:07,904 --> 00:33:09,736
with whom?

284
00:33:17,862 --> 00:33:19,819
It's the person who wears children watch

285
00:33:20,904 --> 00:33:22,819
and video calls me every day?

286
00:33:27,779 --> 00:33:28,903
I'm sorry, Ake.

287
00:33:31,862 --> 00:33:33,819
For making this awkward.

288
00:33:36,737 --> 00:33:37,861
You don't have to worry.

289
00:33:38,904 --> 00:33:40,903
My practice will end soon.

290
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:42,903
I'll pack up fast

291
00:33:43,945 --> 00:33:45,986
to get away from you.

292
00:33:56,945 --> 00:33:57,944
Tue.

293
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:03,778
Don't you want to know?

294
00:34:07,737 --> 00:34:08,986
About who's I

295
00:34:10,904 --> 00:34:11,986
have feeling for?

296
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:22,819
With the people who made me

297
00:34:23,945 --> 00:34:25,986
Got infected with chickenpox a second time.

298
00:34:47,862 --> 00:34:49,861
You said you had it before.

299
00:34:51,945 --> 00:34:53,986
I just called me to ask my mom.

300
00:34:56,737 --> 00:34:57,861
My mother said

301
00:34:57,987 --> 00:34:59,903
that last time I was ill-assumed.

302
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:05,028
I got it from you.

303
00:35:07,737 --> 00:35:08,736
That night.

304
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:19,903
That night

305
00:35:20,737 --> 00:35:21,819
was just a practice

306
00:35:22,945 --> 00:35:23,944
but tonight,

307
00:35:24,904 --> 00:35:26,819
it's real.

308
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:29,944
You don't have to be afraid,

309
00:35:30,945 --> 00:35:32,861
I'll take care of you.

310
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:34,944
Do not let you infect anyone anymore.

311
00:35:35,862 --> 00:35:36,903
You're a coach

312
00:35:39,737 --> 00:35:40,819
Not a doctor.

313
00:35:41,945 --> 00:35:43,778
How can you take care of it?

314
00:35:45,945 --> 00:35:47,819
I'm not a doctor

315
00:35:48,862 --> 00:35:50,861
but I know how to treat you.

316
00:35:51,904 --> 00:35:52,903
Wanna try?

317
00:35:54,904 --> 00:35:55,861
Ouch!

318
00:35:57,737 --> 00:35:58,819
It started to hurt.

319
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:02,944
So tonight

320
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:04,819
let's do it?

321
00:36:05,987 --> 00:36:07,819
Three injections.

322
00:36:07,904 --> 00:36:08,986
Saucy.

323
00:36:09,987 --> 00:36:11,861
First day together

324
00:36:12,904 --> 00:36:14,778
and you wanna do it?

325
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:16,944
Are we boyfriends?

326
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:18,819
Oh!

327
00:36:21,737 --> 00:36:23,736
Oh... I'm kidding..

328
00:36:24,945 --> 00:36:26,819
I like you.

329
00:36:28,945 --> 00:36:29,944
Be my boyfriend.

330
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:06,819
Are you hungry?

331
00:37:07,779 --> 00:37:08,819
I am.

332
00:37:10,862 --> 00:37:13,861
And how about your wound. Is it better?

333
00:37:13,987 --> 00:37:15,861
Better

334
00:37:17,779 --> 00:37:19,861
but it is still a little itchy.

335
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:28,736
If you want to be recover,

336
00:37:29,737 --> 00:37:30,903
can give you an injection.

337
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:33,736
Know how to do it?

338
00:37:35,737 --> 00:37:37,944
Have you ever did with men?

339
00:37:39,862 --> 00:37:40,944
Not at all

340
00:37:41,987 --> 00:37:44,903
but I guess it's not that difficult.

341
00:37:46,737 --> 00:37:47,819
Yes...

342
00:37:48,904 --> 00:37:52,903
I'll teach you tonight.

343
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:23,903
Today the weather is good.

344
00:38:25,945 --> 00:38:26,944
Don't you think?

345
00:38:30,737 --> 00:38:31,778
Good.

346
00:38:36,737 --> 00:38:37,819
Aren't you cold?

347
00:38:39,862 --> 00:38:41,944
saw your blanket so small.

348
00:38:45,945 --> 00:38:46,861
I'm cold.

349
00:38:48,862 --> 00:38:51,861
The motherf* blanket is very small.

350
00:38:55,862 --> 00:38:57,778
I'm not warm in any way.

351
00:38:59,862 --> 00:39:01,861
So let me be a blanket for you?

352
00:39:03,862 --> 00:39:04,903
My hug is warm.

353
00:39:43,862 --> 00:39:45,819
Is it warm?

354
00:39:45,945 --> 00:39:47,861
It's warm.

355
00:39:54,945 --> 00:39:56,819
If you're warm,

356
00:39:57,820 --> 00:39:59,819
why is your body still shaking?

357
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:02,944
I don't know.

358
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:11,861
Here..

359
00:40:12,904 --> 00:40:14,819
They said

360
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:18,819
hugging and kissing

361
00:40:20,904 --> 00:40:22,903
can chase away the cold.

362
00:40:29,904 --> 00:40:31,819
What theory is that?

363
00:40:32,945 --> 00:40:34,944
I've never heard.

364
00:40:35,862 --> 00:40:37,861
Coach Tue's theory.

365
00:40:40,862 --> 00:40:42,861
The one you are hugging.

366
00:40:45,029 --> 00:40:47,819
Close your eyes, relax.

367
00:40:49,862 --> 00:40:51,819
Chase the cold away.
