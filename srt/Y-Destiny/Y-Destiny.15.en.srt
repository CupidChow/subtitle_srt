1
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:06,039
Teacher P'Sun, I'm very exited.

2
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,039
This is my first time.

3
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,079
Is it difficult for you?

4
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,999
Being my boyfriend, you have to be patient

5
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,119
I can't stand it.

6
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,039
Just to have you next to me,

7
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,119
I'm happy.

8
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,079
You're really cute, Nuea.

9
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:38,119
Will I meet someone as cute as you again?

10
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,119
You exaggerate too
much.

11
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,039
Are you tired, uncle?

12
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,039
No.

13
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,999
I'm sorry for making it hard for you.

14
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,079
Why did you hit me?

15
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,039
Uncle, don't say like that.

16
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,039
We're in relationship now.

17
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,159
If one is happy, it is shared.

18
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:23,119
If one is suffering, it is shared too.

19
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,119
Are you achy, Uncle?

20
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,159
A little.

21
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,079
Let me give you a massage.

22
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,239
Okay.

23
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,999
Feeling better, uncle?

24
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,239
Much better.

25
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,239
Oh, I've made some noodles for you.

26
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,199
- Noodles
- Umm.

27
00:02:59,200 --> 00:02:59,799
My favorite.

28
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:14,079
This is Nong Nuea's noodle recipe.

29
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,119
Try it.

30
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,199
Is it delicious, Uncle?

31
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,039
Yes.

32
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,999
I can make noodles now.

33
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,159
Do you want to go to a concert?

34
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,119
Yes.

35
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,119
Wait a minute.

36
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,119
Here are the concert tickets.

37
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,199
Concert.
- Umm.

38
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,039
Save Sunday concert.

39
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,159
Yes.

40
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,199
Huh, Save Sunday concert.

41
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,119
Save Sunday!

42
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,159
Is this real?

43
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,039
It's real.

44
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,079
Save Sunday! Save Sunday!

45
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,199
Save Sunday!

46
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,079
Can I give you a kiss?

47
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,199
One more time?

48
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,079
Thank you very much.

49
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,199
Wait.

50
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,119
Did you forget something?

51
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,119
The reason that this Prince will ask his Beloved Smile to go out today is...

52
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:58,079
One, he hasn't been out to see his friends for a long time, a total of three months.

53
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,199
So the Prince would like your permission.

54
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:07,079
Second, Kaeng, my friend, has always invited me to hang out.

55
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:10,079
And I want to hang out with him.

56
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,159
Part three...

57
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:23,119
If we are apart some times, it might make us miss each other more.

58
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:36,070
Fourth, my Smile is the cutest in the world, right?

59
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:41,110
Fifth, The Prince loves his Smile only.

60
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:44,039
The Prince promised that he would never look at anyone again.

61
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,119
Sounds good.

62
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:09,119
But the Smile still doesn't see any benefit that both of us will get.

63
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,159
The benefit that you will get is

64
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:20,199
you can read a book and sleep without any one bothering.

65
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:24,999
For the Prince's benefit,

66
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:29,199
he get to go out to relax with his friends.

67
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:36,199
Permission granted?

68
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,159
Relax?

69
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:45,199
So when the Prince is with Smile, you're stressed?

70
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:52,239
Not like that, Smile. I used the wrong word.
I mean..

71
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,239
The Prince get to hang out with his friends.

72
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:03,039
The Prince's Project isn't very sharp.

73
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:07,079
And, didn't you think that your outfit

74
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:11,199
was too good looking and seductive.

75
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:17,159
My outfit? This outfit is pretty normal.

76
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:24,119
But if you want me to change, I will.

77
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,119
Permission granted?

78
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,039
The Prince will go now.

79
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,199
- Hello.
- Hello.

80
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,039
Wait.

81
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,159
Yes?

82
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,159
Completed your duties yet?

83
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:21,999
Laundry, mopping and packed up for you, all done.

84
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:25,079
Very good, then you can go.

85
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,199
But come back no later than 10PM.

86
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,239
10 PM?

87
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:41,999
But it's already 8:30 PM.
I couldn't be back in time for 10 PM.

88
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:47,159
Can I extend the time?

89
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,199
So, 10:15.

90
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,079
May I extend to 11PM?

91
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,119
No go.

92
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:59,039
So it's 10:15. I will hurry back.

93
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,199
Wait.

94
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,159
Yes?

95
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,199
Did you forget something?

96
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,039
Bye.

97
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,239
OK.

98
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,199
Bro?

99
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,199
P'Team hasn't arrived yet.

100
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,079
So late.

101
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,039
Too late for him.

102
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,159
Kaeng?

103
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,119
Kaeng?

104
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,239
Kaeng?

105
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,039
What is this outfit about?

106
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,199
-Oh...P'Team!
-My best friend, Team!

107
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,159
Why?

108
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,239
This is normal?

109
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,039
I thought you're the uncle that come to pick up his nephew home.

110
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,079
Not cool for our gang.

111
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:18,159
Shut up. Just that I can get out is a blessing.

112
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,119
Team, look. The table over there squinted at you.

113
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,119
Nope, I already have a boyfriend.

114
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,119
Ah, go, go, drink.

115
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:38,199
Oh, I'm sorry, he already has a boyfriend.

116
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,119
Come here.

117
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,999
I'll make one for you.

118
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:48,999
I'll take water.

119
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:52,199
- What?
- I'll take water.

120
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,119
Kaeng.

121
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,999
- Come here.
- Cheers!

122
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,199
Been so long!

123
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,999
- Nuea. What time is it?
- Huh?

124
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,039
I have to go back.

125
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:48,159
What time is it?

126
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:56,119
The Prince came back at 10:14.

127
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,079
A minute, earlier.

128
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:07,079
And the Smile is still not sleeping?

129
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,999
I can't sleep.

130
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:34,039
Without a Prince, it's weird.

131
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:42,199
Let the Prince make his Smile fall asleep?

132
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:47,239
No need, I will.

133
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,159
Coach Tue, I'm your boyfriend.

134
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,639
Lost again?

135
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,839
It was full of loopholes.

136
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,799
The moodier, the more out of focus.

137
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,719
Oy.

138
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,719
Coach Tue,

139
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,759
I'm your boyfriend.

140
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,719
Just pretend to lose for me.

141
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,719
You don't have to be serious all the time.

142
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,799
It's different.

143
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,879
In a match, you can't pretend to lose.

144
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,799
It will give the opponent the advantage.

145
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,719
Do you understand?

146
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:01,799
Come here.

147
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:03,719
OK.

148
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,679
So one more round?

149
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,679
Come, Coach Tue.

150
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:18,719
Oy.

151
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,719
What is it?

152
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:24,799
I got dizzy...

153
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:26,839
My head hurts.

154
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:29,799
What's wrong?

155
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,679
How are you?

156
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,839
Is this a foul play?

157
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,879
Oy.

158
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,839
It hurts.

159
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,679
No more practice.

160
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,839
- Okay.
- Oh, does it hurt?

161
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,839
You already had good mitts.

162
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,759
And you're complaining?

163
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,719
You can put my mitten on then.

164
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,719
Help me put them on.

165
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,759
Nicely.

166
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,679
Calm down.

167
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,799
What are you playing at?

168
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,839
Crazy ass coach.

169
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,759
Do you like it?

170
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:11,799
I might like it.

171
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:13,839
Might?

172
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,679
I'm so sad.

173
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:24,639
So... I might not like it

174
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,719
but like it very much

175
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:33,679
and would have liked it better if someone put them on for me.

176
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:58,759
I love you.

177
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,719
what?

178
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,839
I said

179
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,759
I love you.

180
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,719
Crazy ass coach.

181
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:20,839
It hurts.

182
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,839
Oh, sorry.

183
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,679
Coach Tue.

184
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,799
What?

185
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:57,759
Want to kiss?

186
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,719
Everyone else will see us.

187
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,759
Should we go back to my room?

188
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:07,799
Fast.

189
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,719
Papa loves Daddy the most in the world.

190
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,599
Baby Seven.

191
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,599
So cute.

192
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,679
Are you hungry?

193
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:54,719
Papi?

194
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,679
Yes?

195
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,639
Why are you begging?

196
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,679
What you want?

197
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,599
Acting suspicious.

198
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,679
Nope.

199
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,799
Who dares to take anything from you?

200
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,759
Yes, right?

201
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,799
Tell me.

202
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,679
What's up?

203
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:25,639
Can Papi ask Daddy to go out tonight?

204
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,799
With whom and where?

205
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,719
With Team and Nuea.

206
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,759
We talked in the group chat.

207
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,639
Please?

208
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,719
I promise to behave nicely.

209
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,799
Will you let me?

210
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,759
Here's the permission granter.

211
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,719
Don't use the baby kiss.

212
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,679
So you allowed?

213
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:11,639
Umm... go.

214
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,679
Really?

215
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,679
But

216
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:24,279
you have a boyfriend, and he is very jealous.

217
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,639
Babe, you gotta let me wear this for real?

218
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,599
If you don't want to wear it, take it off.

219
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,599
But I don't want you to go.

220
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,599
Not that I don't want you to wear.

221
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,559
I can wear it.

222
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:40,799
Don't forget to pick up my call.

223
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,719
If you don't accept it, there'll be a problem.

224
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,439
I will be there myself.

225
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,759
Yes.

226
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,679
I know!

227
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,599
Give me some money.

228
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,639
Here it is! A nerve asking for them.

229
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:07,679
Please.

230
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,679
Wait.

231
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,599
A hundred.

232
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,719
Umm.

233
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:17,759
Daddy?

234
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,519
What?

235
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,639
Almost not enough for the car.

236
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:24,759
Almost doesn't mean not enough.

237
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:29,679
You told me that you'd sit and talk. Why are you going to share the drink fees?

238
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:31,679
So go or no go?

239
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,639
A hundred is fine.

240
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,719
Go now.

241
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,759
Have a safe trip.

242
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,759
Don't be stubborn like the kids.

243
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,639
- OK, bye bye.
- Bye bye.

244
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,679
Bye.

245
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:49,759
Go!

246
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,679
Nowadays your skill is getting worse, Nuea.

247
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,799
Asking me about my shirt but then what are you wearing?

248
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:18,679
If I don't wear it, he won't let me go.

249
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,639
What are you laughing at?

250
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:22,679
Nothing.

251
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:27,719
Talked about him, and he calls right away.

252
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,559
Hello, babe.

253
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,759
Not in bed yet?

254
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,559
Nope, still waiting.

255
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,599
I'll drink a bit more and I'll back.

256
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,679
- Hurry back.
- Brother Kaeng, Brother Kaeng?

257
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,599
I'd like to talk to P'Puth, please.

258
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,719
Go on.

259
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:49,670
P'Puth, I'll take care of P'Kaeng myself. Don't worry.

260
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:55,679
Okay, so have fun.

261
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:56,719
That's all.

262
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:58,559
Bye bye.

263
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:01,719
What are you laughing at?

264
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,639
Nope.

265
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,799
Excuse me, cheer to you.

266
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,559
OK.

267
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,599
Who?

268
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,679
- This is a cute shirt.
- Thank you.

269
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,759
Excuse me, cheers to you?

270
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,679
Yes.

271
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,719
You're cute. Put on your boyfriend's shirt.

272
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,799
If it's me, I will love to death.

273
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:27,799
Thank you.

274
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:34,599
Kaeng, since you wear this shirt, so many people approaching.

275
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,719
My boyfriend's name is Puth.

276
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,559
- See.
- Oh.

277
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,599
My boyfriend's name is Puth.

278
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,679
Bro, don't laugh.

279
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:46,799
Good for you.

280
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,639
Should we wear too, P'Team?

281
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,559
He calls again?

282
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,719
Papi is coming.

283
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,799
Have you waited a long time, Daddy?

284
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,719
Papi loves Daddy.

285
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,639
Let's take a photo together.

286
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,599
Smile a little.

287
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,639
Looking at camera, hon.

288
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,599
Papi loves Daddy the most in the world.

289
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:21,599
Are you tired, Thurs?

290
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:24,599
With you besides me, I'm not tired.

291
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,839
After that...

292
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:42,679
a child ran down to hide in the basement.

293
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,639
Shortly after he was hidden,

294
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:49,679
a foot appeared.

295
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:55,679
A foot in ancient shoe swayed.

296
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:59,719
The boy, when he saw it, his eyes widened.

297
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:06,719
Then it rained with the sound of thunder.

298
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:10,799
What will happen with them in this abandoned house?

299
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:16,679
What they found was only in their thoughts,

300
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:23,639
a set up, or really
the ghost of the abandoned house?

301
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:29,759
Welcome to Haunted Days, Dorm Nights.

302
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:36,799
For tonight, goodbye everyone.

303
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:43,799
Haha... Done.

304
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:52,719
- Are you tired, Thurs?
- With you by my side, I can't be.

305
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:56,719
By the way, are you tired or bored

306
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:59,679
to help me do something like this?

307
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:03,679
You think too much!
Not tired, not bored at all.

308
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:07,679
It's a form of creativity. It's fun!

309
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:11,679
Just you don't do medium, I'm very happy.

310
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:14,799
But medium makes a lot better money.

311
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,679
- A comment?
- Umm...

312
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,719
Can I see?

313
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,719
I'm tired of you. Always told from other's stories.

314
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,799
Yes, I'd like to hear from other people.

315
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:35,759
I want to see you invite others to co-tell.

316
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:42,759
Well, at this point, I'm out of content.

317
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:46,799
What I experienced, I already told them.

318
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:53,679
And I don't know who could host the show.

319
00:31:53,800 --> 00:32:00,679
Umm... How about this! Try to think. Maybe ask your friends or the fans.

320
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:03,759
There might be someone who wants to co host the show with you.

321
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,679
The fans?

322
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:15,599
I don't want anyone to come host the show.

323
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:22,719
And my friends... they all have boyfriends.

324
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:26,679
Who's going to be free?

325
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,599
- Boyfriend...
- Umm!

326
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:42,759
- So you? Come host the show with me.
- No, I can't host and I don't speak clearly.

327
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:46,639
It's okay. Just come as a guest?

328
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:50,759
- You don't have to be good at talking.
- No!

329
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:54,799
If I host the show, who's going to handle the sound?

330
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:59,679
I can let Khao Niao and Waat do that.

331
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:03,639
Host the show with me? Please...

332
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:08,799
If my boyfriend wouldn't help me, who would?

333
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:13,679
- Please.
- Well, ok!

334
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:17,759
Really? Yes! You're the best.

335
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:24,839
- I'll prepare the script for you.
- OK.

336
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,599
OK...

337
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:38,679
Hello everyone!

338
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:43,799
Welcome to the scariest show of the night

339
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:49,599
with the Haunted Days, Dorm Nights.

340
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:54,679
Meet Thurs, Chairman of the Mysterious Club

341
00:33:54,720 --> 00:34:00,679
Today, I'm not the only one here.

342
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:06,679
We have a special guest, which is Khun Pae.

343
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:11,799
And we have a personal story to share.

344
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:16,639
It's something that just happened recently.

345
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:21,719
It's a story between man and ghost.

346
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,679
I'm not sure too that

347
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:28,839
if it's faith or destiny.

348
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:33,759
We want everyone to listen carefully.

349
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:41,759
- Because of this is both scary and cute
- Yes.

350
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:45,759
The story goes... there is a 1st year boy.

351
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:50,719
Cute with six senses, and love mysteries

352
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:53,839
and a little indifference.

353
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:58,759
Oh, it's a cute type of indifference.

354
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:05,719
One day, that first year boy

355
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:12,599
met a ghost, great looks, cute personality.

356
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:17,839
But that ghost can't remember anything,

357
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:22,599
like a ghost with amnesia.

358
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:28,839
That boy named that ghost as Pao,

359
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:34,839
name of the dog next door that he loves.

360
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,719
That Pao ghost...

361
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:44,719
helped the boy, stay with the boy.

362
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:48,839
Both when sleeping and awaken.

363
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:55,719
And the boy fell in love with Pao.

364
00:35:56,600 --> 00:36:00,839
Because the cuteness was overwhelmed.

365
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,279
Pao, I know that Pao is here.

366
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:09,759
I come this time, it's the last time.

367
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:12,719
I don't want you to go.

368
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:17,719
Can you trust me? That we will meet again.

369
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:29,719
You and him are meant to be, there's always a reason to meet.

370
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:33,679
After that,

371
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:39,719
destiny made the two see each other again.

372
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:43,839
Though Pao didn't immediately recognize Thurs,

373
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:51,719
but their bond made them remember each other easily.

374
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:57,759
When they knew each other, they became boyfriends,

375
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:02,759
and they have been in a relationship to today.

376
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:06,719
The story of the first year boy and Pao Ghost,

377
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:10,719
ended with this, everyone.

378
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:15,799
Thank you very much for staying with us until the end of the program.

379
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:23,719
Goodbye and Good night.

380
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,719
Done!

381
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:35,679
The story we've been telling, will it be a happy ending?

382
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:40,719
A very, very happy ending.

383
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:48,559
- Really happy.
- I'm happy too.

384
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:05,639
Thank you for hosting this birthday party for me.

385
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:30,039
Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you.

386
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:35,039
Happy birthday.

387
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:40,879
Happy birthday to Tir

388
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:54,959
Thank you for hosting a birthday party for Tir.

389
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:18,639
I told you, the thing you have, they are yours.

390
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:29,839
Don't worry, I'm happy to.

391
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:34,879
Masuk, try the food. Is it alright?

392
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,959
Thank you, Hia.

393
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:55,959
What's going on, Masuk? Food not good?

394
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:04,959
It's delicious but it's hot.

395
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:16,799
Here...

396
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:29,839
Food that you spooned for me

397
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,039
is the most delicious.

398
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:48,959
If you like, I'll do another spoon.

399
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:33,959
Hia...

400
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,799
Hmm...

401
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:41,839
You're very tired today.

402
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:43,959
I'll wash the dishes for you.

403
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:46,879
You go take a break.

404
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:48,959
Huh!

405
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,919
I'm not tired.

406
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:06,799
I'm glad.

407
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:33,039
Masuk?

408
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,799
I have something to tell you.

409
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:45,879
What is it?

410
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,839
Can we go on third base?

411
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:19,879
Are you crazy!

412
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,919
Tir might see us.

413
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:30,999
Tir won't know.

414
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:37,839
See? Tir is happy at his birthday party in heaven.

415
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:49,919
You talking nonsense.

416
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:31,919
Sat, have you been waiting long?

417
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:50,519
Sat, have you been waiting long?

418
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:53,479
Not that long, Choke.

419
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:12,959
- What are you looking at? I'm embarrassed.
- We lovers. I've seen you all. Come in!

420
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:21,679
Be quite, the others can hear us.

421
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:24,519
Let them hear everything.

422
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:33,559
You look very mature in these swimming trunks.

423
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:36,599
Why? Is it daddy's trunks?

424
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:45,510
- No.. It just looks...
- Stop! You pervert! I know what you're going to say.

425
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:56,679
Sat!

426
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:01,599
Or you want me to kiss you?

427
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:12,599
- You crazy! I'm gonna swim.
- Choke, wait for me.

428
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:15,639
Choke!
- Sat!

429
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:20,479
Choke!
- Sat!

430
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:42,639
Sat! Sat!

431
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:46,719
Sat!

432
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:51,439
Sat!

433
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:05,519
Sat!

434
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:09,870
What's wrong with you. Don't play like this!

435
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:11,999
I was worried about you.

436
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:18,950
Choke, are you mad?

437
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:23,390
Sorry, I just wanna play with you.

438
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:28,399
Let's go back. I want to go back.

439
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:32,559
Choke, Choke, wait!

440
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:36,599
Choke! Choke!

441
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:40,479
Choke! Choke! Choke!

442
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:47,799
Choke, I just want to kiss you.

443
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:53,159
But you won't let me.

444
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:55,119
So I...

445
00:49:58,040 --> 00:49:59,639
So you set it up?

446
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:04,519
You know you've done wrong.

447
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:23,439
People who make mistakes must be punished.

448
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:30,159
What's the punishment?

449
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:35,990
Choke, what are you doing?

450
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:46,519
Do what you want me to do.

451
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:41,639
Finally, this semester we have boyfriends.

452
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:05,079
They're not here yet. Assholes.

453
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:09,879
It's not time yet. Why in such a hurry?

454
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:14,999
Today we'll have fun. Just leave it for a day.

455
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:18,999
Friends will start arriving.

456
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:21,999
I understand.

457
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:25,079
Are you feeling hot?

458
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:32,039
Tue, Ake, we are here.

459
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:34,999
- Hello.
- Hi!

460
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:38,039
Ahem... You look so bright, Masuk.

461
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:45,879
- We're here.
- Good morning.

462
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:48,999
- Good morning.
- Hello.

463
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:53,879
Six of you are late. Prepare to be our slaves the whole trip.

464
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:56,039
P'Puth! You woke up late again.

465
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:59,919
I told you to wake up early. If I don't wake you, will you even be here?

466
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:02,919
Team, you look at your boyfriend. He's a big deal now.

467
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:05,999
So grumpy, I don't know why. I hardly slept.

468
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,039
You deserve it. No discipline.

469
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:14,079
- Papi...
- Oh...

470
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:18,079
But I think it's definitely not me that's a slave.

471
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:19,999
Did you forget...

472
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:23,879
- Sun and Nuea aren't here yet!
- Well, yeah...

473
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:29,879
- Ahem, I'm sorry. Give way.
- Here they are.

474
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:40,879
Oh! Oy! What are you guys on about?

475
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:41,919
Bro!

476
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:46,030
- I think we will toe the slave this trip.
- Well, I want to use him!

477
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:49,910
- I was always the slave. Let him be this time!
- Let's go.

478
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:51,879
Let's go.

479
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,879
- Do you mind?
- Oh.

480
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:56,919
Well, be careful what's inside.

481
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:58,039
- This too.
- Take care of it well, P'Sun.

482
00:53:58,040 --> 00:53:59,959
Thank you P'Sun.

483
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:00,959
- Mind them for me, P'Sun.
- Yes, yes.

484
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,119
- Thank you, P'Sun.
- Yes.

485
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:05,079
- I'm fine.
- Huh, what!

486
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,079
Take care of it.

487
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:10,919
Yes, Nong Nuea.

488
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:12,999
Again?

489
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,079
Consider it a production thing.

490
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:59,919
Bro, hey.

491
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:07,039
- Ooh... Oh...
- So beautiful.

492
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:11,079
Everyone, I have reserved rooms for you.

493
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:14,919
If there is no prob then let's go in.

494
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:18,879
Well, see you in the evening.

495
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:21,119
Do whatever you need to but spare you energy.

496
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:25,079
You are the strongest...

497
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:27,119
- So beautiful.
- See you soon.

498
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:29,079
Go...

499
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:34,999
Can I ride on your back? Faster!
- Wow... that's extra.

500
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,999
Ohhh... Will there be glue on it?

501
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:46,079
- Nong Nuea, let's go.
- Sun!

502
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:48,959
- You forget something?
- Yes!

503
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,079
What?

504
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:52,879
That you are a slave this trip.

505
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:57,919
Oh... a slave?

506
00:55:58,080 --> 00:56:01,919
Leaving it to you. Let's go, Papi.

507
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,079
Like I was a hanging rial.

508
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:08,879
Do it quickly, Teacher P'Sun.
I'll wait in the room.

509
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:15,959
Nuea, wait for me.

510
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:30,919
Hello everyone, you're with this same old Mon again.

511
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:35,959
I'm at Khao Yai with my friends and bros.

512
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:39,119
And, of course, the Prince.

513
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:42,879
- Will be right back. I'll find someone.
- Okay.

514
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:46,119
This is this guy, my friend Thurs.

515
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:49,879
- What is this?!
- And who was that? Introducing yourself.

516
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:50,599
Hello, I'm Pae.

517
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:56,959
- My very boyfriend.
- Ooh, the very boyfriend.

518
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:01,959
You can follow us at "Haunting Days, Dorm Nights"

519
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,919
With me, Thurs and Pae.

520
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:07,039
OMG... so cute.

521
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:11,039
It's better not to bother them, let's go find someone else.

522
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:16,999
Hello Masuk, who are you with?

523
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:20,999
- Hello, this is Jia.
- He looks very nice.

524
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:22,039
What?

525
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:25,959
- I'm glad to see you Smile.
- Go somewhere else.

526
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:32,959
- OK, I don't want to bother lovers. Bye.

527
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:37,079
Ooh, Brother Puth, Brother Kaeng, oh...

528
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:41,959
Love birds everywhere, dorm, uni, and here!

529
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:45,119
- Let us be, we're newly met.
- Ummm...

530
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:49,039
- Don't look newly at all!
- Well, something is new.

531
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:53,119
Which is?

532
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:58,039
- Go away, go.
- Okay, won't bother now.

533
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:03,079
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Mon...

534
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:06,879
P'Tiw! Who is this person?

535
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:08,879
My wife...

536
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:12,079
Brother... are you a wife?

537
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:20,919
Who's your wife, Tiw? I just did that to you just now....

538
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,959
Better not say...

539
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:30,999
Teacher P'Sun, are you tired?

540
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:34,039
Just that you're here, I'm not tired...

541
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:36,079
They are so sweet.

542
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:39,079
- I help you grill.
I took the barbecue, now I'm gone.

543
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:40,999
Mon! What are you doing?

544
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:44,999
- What are you doing?
- It's for P'Team.

545
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:49,959
Aren't you in a sweetheart?
So cute! A kiss too...

546
00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:54,879
I won't give up. I'll go find my baby.

547
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:59,959
Bye-bye. What's up with him?

548
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:09,039
To hit drum, we have to stand in this pose too?

549
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:11,879
- Huh!
- You'll make mistakes.

550
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:18,039
What mistakes, the drums or...? - Oh, juicy.

551
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:20,999
And who's that guy?

552
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:23,870
My Boyfriend...

553
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:30,879
- Boyfriend means lover...
- Go away. Go.

554
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:36,999
I'm back, the Prince. Brought you a barbecue.

555
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:40,919
- Let's go eat?
- I'll tell them.

556
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:44,879
- Let's go, everyone, let's eat.
- We're gonna eat n,cw. Bye-bye.

557
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:46,999
Slave, hurry up.

558
00:59:53,920 --> 01:00:00,119
- To our love.
- Cheers... woo...

559
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:04,999
Cheers!

560
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:10,919
Guys, did you thank my wife?

561
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:17,959
- Oh... Thank you.
- It's okay, you're fine.

562
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:28,999
What are you on about?

563
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:03,079
THE END

564
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:11,959
Finally, this semester, we have boyfriends.

565
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:17,879
Yes!

566
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:20,999
Our babies are so cute.

567
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:27,039
Look for a new one next semester!
-Yeah...

568
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:29,879
Don't find a new one.

569
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:37,079
- Following Sun..
- What? I said I love my boyfriend very much.

570
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:39,879
So cute.

571
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:46,879
I have something I want to say.
- What is it, bro, so serious?

572
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:52,079
I really have to thank fate

573
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:55,999
that made me born to be Sun

574
01:02:00,040 --> 01:02:02,119
and made me meet Nuea...

575
01:02:06,040 --> 01:02:08,039
and also you guys.

576
01:02:08,080 --> 01:02:10,039
This term!

577
01:02:10,040 --> 01:02:13,879
We've been through a lot and we got through.

578
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:15,879
Can you make a promise with me

579
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:20,039
that we won't leave each other?

580
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:23,959
- Can you make a promise?
- A promise it is. Yes!

581
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:28,079
- Promise me, Nong Nuea.
- Oh, they won't stop!

582
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:29,999
Love us like you do him!

583
01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:33,039
Can we just be serious for 1 minute?

584
01:02:33,080 --> 01:02:38,879
I would like to thank P'Team...

585
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:40,959
P’Kaeng...

586
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:45,879
who always advise me

587
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:49,959
when I need help.

588
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:55,919
And I would like to thank Teacher P'Sun

589
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,879
That makes me understand that...

590
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:06,999
All that I've put in, it's not for money

591
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:09,999
but it's love.

592
01:03:11,080 --> 01:03:14,999
Thank you for being the cutest lover for me.

593
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:25,079
So... how are the others? What do you want to say bro?

594
01:03:25,960 --> 01:03:27,879
Oh!

595
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:33,959
Don't be in a hurry, calm down.

596
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:36,039
Uh...

597
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:43,879
I want to thank myself first for being a boxer.

598
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:46,999
That made me meet you.

599
01:03:47,080 --> 01:03:49,119
And I want to thank you

600
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,110
that came to be an obstacle,

601
01:03:54,920 --> 01:03:56,999
it makes me know that...

602
01:03:57,920 --> 01:04:00,039
Obstacles can turn into love.

603
01:04:08,080 --> 01:04:10,119
I want to thank myself too.

604
01:04:11,960 --> 01:04:15,839
that I change myself for someone.

605
01:04:16,040 --> 01:04:18,879
And I thank you.

606
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:21,959
Who taught me that...

607
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:25,919
I don't always have to win.

608
01:04:34,080 --> 01:04:38,039
Wow...so cute...

609
01:04:40,120 --> 01:04:42,959
Puth! What about yours?

610
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:48,999
Thank you Kaeng

611
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,079
that makes me know...

612
01:04:57,040 --> 01:04:59,119
how much Papi loves me.

613
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:01,959
Thank you Papi.

614
01:05:01,960 --> 01:05:03,879
Yes...

615
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:08,919
So do you have something to tell everyone?

616
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:11,919
Me...

617
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:17,999
- Papi would like to thank Daddy.
- Umm...

618
01:05:20,120 --> 01:05:22,879

619
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:28,039
And I want to thank Mon

620
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:36,999

621
01:05:39,960 --> 01:05:44,199
made I was willing to change myself for him.

622
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:47,039
And then...

623
01:05:47,120 --> 01:05:54,999
I want to thank you, Team, and Nuea for always being there for me

624
01:05:56,080 --> 01:05:58,999
on days that I have no one.

625
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:05,959
I would like to thank all of you very much.

626
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:09,119
Especially Kaeng, Nuea

627
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:12,079

628
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:14,879
And...

629
01:06:16,120 --> 01:06:19,079
I would like to thank Mon

631

Thank you for bringing happiness to me.

638
01:06:53,880 --> 01:06:56,959
I had never been this happy before.

639
01:06:59,080 --> 01:07:03,039
Thank you all, brothers.

640
01:07:03,080 --> 01:07:05,919
All my friends too.

641
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:09,999

642

Thank you for being with me all the time.

643
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:17,959
Even when I'm sad

644
01:07:18,440 --> 01:07:22,999
or when we are happy together.

645
01:07:25,040 --> 01:07:28,919
I want to see everyone happy like this forever.

646
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:34,999
Thank you very much everyone.
- Umm...

647
01:07:37,120 --> 01:07:39,919
Go, Pae.

648
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:41,919
- Oh!
- Skipping you.

649
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:43,919
What?

650
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:45,999
Oh...

651
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:52,039
Thank you, Thurs for everything.

652
01:07:52,040 --> 01:07:54,999
If it weren't for you, I'd be in a bad shape.

653
01:07:55,040 --> 01:08:01,999
Well, speaking like we know who Pao is.
- It's him.

654
01:08:02,040 --> 01:08:05,079
But I won't take it anymore, Pao!

655
01:08:09,080 --> 01:08:15,119
Thank you Pao for keeping the promise.

656
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:20,999
And thank you very much, Mon and P'Puth

657
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:24,039

01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:32,919
And the most important thing is...

659
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:35,079

660
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:37,079

663
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:52,039
Well...

664
01:08:54,040 --> 01:08:59,079
Me then. I want to thank Masuk for being such a good code bro.

665
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:02,079
Thank you for being my friend.

666
01:09:03,960 --> 01:09:05,999

And thank you everyone, especially P'Masuk

679
01:10:02,920 --> 01:10:05,919
who was always by Sat's side.

680
01:10:08,120 --> 01:10:12,910
Thank you for being my best friend and my boyfriend.

681
01:10:15,080 --> 01:10:17,999

Nothing.

Thank you for being able to

699
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,959
live happily

700
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:49,079
Just like Tir had asked for...

701
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:54,999
Thank you Tir...

702
01:12:00,920 --> 01:12:03,039
Thank you for...

703
01:12:05,200 --> 01:12:07,959
always by my side

704
01:12:10,120 --> 01:12:12,999

715
01:13:07,960 --> 01:13:10,959

717
01:13:16,920 --> 01:13:19,079
for opening up his heart to let me in

718
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:22,119
though inside, there is still Tir there.

719
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:25,919
Yes, Hia.

720

for giving me a chance to love Masuk

723
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:43,959
and save my nephew from the fire.

724
01:13:45,080 --> 01:13:49,119
Tir is a good person and the bravest.

725
01:13:50,040 --> 01:13:52,879
Thank you very much, Tir.

726
01:13:53,880 --> 01:13:59,910
Thank you, Tir.

727
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:14,999
Hia...

728
01:14:17,080 --> 01:14:20,079
Thank you for taking care of Masuk.

729
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:24,079
Thank you for...

730
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:26,879
accepting him,

731
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:28,999
bear with him

732
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:31,919
and don't let go of him.

733
01:14:36,120 --> 01:14:38,959
Take care of Masuk.

734
01:14:44,920 --> 01:14:47,039
I thank myself

735
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:58,079

736
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:05,879
and help him open up

737
01:15:06,920 --> 01:15:09,079
to find new love.

738
01:15:10,920 --> 01:15:12,919
Masuk!

739
01:15:16,120 --> 01:15:18,999
I really thank you

740
01:15:21,880 --> 01:15:23,999
for never forgetting me

741
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:27,999
for loving me...

742
01:15:29,880 --> 01:15:31,999
I love you.

743
01:15:42,040 --> 01:15:46,079
Being an ordinary person day by day

744
01:15:46,080 --> 01:15:55,959
Waking up to the same life with more loneliness

745
01:15:56,000 --> 01:16:06,039
I envy that everyone had someone beside him

746
01:16:06,920 --> 01:16:10,959
Everyone looks at me, I seem fine

747
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:19,119
Deep inside, I can't stand it, my heart calls for

748
01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:28,119
someone who will change the lives of the ordinary

749
01:16:28,920 --> 01:16:32,919
to become meaningful
