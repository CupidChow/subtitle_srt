1
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:25,166
Sun: English Major
Sophomore, and Sunday born.

2
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:30,207
Character: bold, impatient, very dignified.

3
00:00:31,125 --> 00:00:36,291
Love Motto: None
He doesn't feel good enough for anyone.

4
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:20,249
Sun? How many bets did you win?

5
00:01:21,292 --> 00:01:25,082
You've got money for SAVE SUNDAY tickets now?

6
00:01:25,167 --> 00:01:29,166
What's the fuck? No.
Because of you, I bet the wrong match.

7
00:01:30,083 --> 00:01:33,249
Cost me my budget for food, rent, and the concert...

8
00:01:35,458 --> 00:01:37,166
What?

9
00:01:38,167 --> 00:01:40,082
I don't know. You are responsible.

10
00:01:40,208 --> 00:01:41,166
Can you borrow your money?

11
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:44,124
If you want it, you have to work.

12
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:46,249
Told you many times not to be arrogant.

13
00:01:47,125 --> 00:01:49,166
Tutoring is good money.

14
00:01:50,167 --> 00:01:52,249
No, I don't like kids. I don't understand.

15
00:01:53,167 --> 00:01:55,207
Instant noodle suits you well.

16
00:01:56,125 --> 00:01:57,249
I only have 500 for you to borrow.

17
00:01:58,125 --> 00:02:00,249
You didn't call just for this, right?

18
00:02:01,208 --> 00:02:06,207
Well, I accepted a teaching job but I forgot to check the schedule.

19
00:02:07,167 --> 00:02:09,166
I'm here to ask for your help.

20
00:02:11,167 --> 00:02:12,291
I don't teach.

21
00:02:13,167 --> 00:02:15,166
Let me give you 70: 30.

22
00:02:15,208 --> 00:02:19,124
Mine 70, your 30, deal?

23
00:02:19,208 --> 00:02:22,166
No 70, no deal.

24
00:02:23,208 --> 00:02:25,207
You really are an asshole.

25
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:27,207
I'll give you 35: 65.

26
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:29,207
You're so Wednesday born,

27
00:02:30,125 --> 00:02:31,124
A lot of tricks.

28
00:02:32,125 --> 00:02:35,207
No 80, no deal.

29
00:02:36,167 --> 00:02:37,124
Hanging up, now.

30
00:02:37,167 --> 00:02:39,207
Hey, wait. Deal.

31
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:41,124
Sun.

32
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:32,082
Sun, awake!

33
00:03:34,167 --> 00:03:35,166
Hey, what?

34
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:36,207
Get up and take a shower quickly.

35
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:38,166
Take a shower, now.

36
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:41,207
Really take a shower?

37
00:03:43,167 --> 00:03:45,124
Get up, Sun.

38
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:47,249
What? I wanna sleep.

39
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:51,082
Take a shower. Let's talk about teaching after this.

40
00:03:51,167 --> 00:03:52,207
You can call if off. I won't teach anymore.

41
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:57,082
I'll call your dad.

42
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,166
I'll go.

43
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:14,082
Now we're talking.

44
00:04:24,167 --> 00:04:25,249
Does he really have to dress up like this?

45
00:04:29,167 --> 00:04:34,207
The student you're gonna teach today is a devil's child.

46
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:37,166
I would like to know how evil he is?

47
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:48,082
Fast!

48
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:08,082
This much?

49
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,124
-Hello.
-Hello.

50
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:13,124
-Come see Master Nuea, right?
-Yes.

51
00:05:13,167 --> 00:05:14,207
Please come this way.

52
00:05:38,167 --> 00:05:39,082
Hello.

53
00:05:48,167 --> 00:05:49,166
Thank you.

54
00:05:51,167 --> 00:05:52,207
Wait a moment, sir.

55
00:05:56,167 --> 00:05:57,124
Thank you.

56
00:05:58,208 --> 00:05:59,166
Thank you.

57
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:01,166
Thank you.

58
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:31,166
Are you thirsty?

59
00:06:32,167 --> 00:06:34,207
Nope.

60
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:45,249
I just want to absorb it here. I want to own this place.

61
00:06:50,292 --> 00:06:52,166
If I stand here, can I own it?

62
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:55,291
Come down before you break something.

63
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:57,124
You're a good friend.

64
00:07:02,167 --> 00:07:04,166
Hey, Puth, what's taking so long?

65
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:09,166
Too long for you?

66
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:10,249
It's been three hours already.

67
00:07:12,167 --> 00:07:16,082
It wasn't that long. Can't you wait?

68
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:20,082
Not that long? Are you okay?

69
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:24,166
Ask us to be here but let us wait.

70
00:07:25,167 --> 00:07:26,166
Isn't it weird?

71
00:07:50,167 --> 00:07:52,249
Oh, Puth Bro, hello.

72
00:07:53,208 --> 00:07:54,166
Hello, Nuea.

73
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:58,207
Hey, you again?

74
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,166
I've got a job.

75
00:08:05,417 --> 00:08:06,166
What job?

76
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:07,166
Tutoring.

77
00:08:07,292 --> 00:08:08,207
Puth got it for me.

78
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:16,124
Bathroom call. Need to piss.

79
00:08:30,167 --> 00:08:31,124
Hey, what?

80
00:09:17,167 --> 00:09:20,082
Hey, this is whom you'll make me teach?

81
00:09:20,167 --> 00:09:22,291
-Puth Bro?
-Yes.

82
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:24,166
Do I have to wait for long?

83
00:09:25,167 --> 00:09:26,166
Not long at all.

84
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:28,124
Not for long?

85
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:31,249
Been here for three hours, I won't teach you.

86
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:40,166
This is Sun.

87
00:09:58,833 --> 00:09:59,791
What now?

88
00:10:04,917 --> 00:10:08,041
This is the sucker that you want me to teach?

89
00:10:09,042 --> 00:10:09,957
Yes.

90
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:12,999
I won't teach him.

91
00:10:15,917 --> 00:10:16,832
I'm going back.

92
00:10:16,917 --> 00:10:17,957
Sun.

93
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:24,832
Sun.

94
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:29,832
Come here, talk to me first.

95
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:32,957
Sun, calm down.

96
00:10:36,917 --> 00:10:37,874
What's up?

97
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:38,957
Talk to me.

98
00:10:40,917 --> 00:10:41,791
Sit.

99
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:50,957
What's wrong?

100
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:57,957
Once you saw his face, you just don't want to teach him?

101
00:10:58,875 --> 00:10:59,832
Brother Nuea?

102
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:02,999
Don't you know I just had an flight with that cunt?

103
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,990
But Nuea is loaded and is also a celebrity at uni.

104
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:13,791
He dis me on social media. Damn it.

105
00:11:14,042 --> 00:11:14,957
You return his money then.

106
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:17,999
The problem is I've spent all the money.

107
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:19,832
It's on you now.

108
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:26,916
Is this a Sunday born whom supposed to loyal and loved his friends very much? All bullshit.

109
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:31,957
That's harsh.

110
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:41,874
Cry then.

111
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:47,041
You don't have to put on the drama.

112
00:11:54,042 --> 00:11:54,916
Can I help?

113
00:11:56,833 --> 00:11:58,916
But you have to give me more money.

114
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,832
Sure, just wait for another deal to transfer in.

115
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:05,832
Okay?

116
00:12:09,917 --> 00:12:10,832
Follow me.

117
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:26,916
Nuea, this is Sun. The tutor whom I want you to study with.

118
00:12:27,792 --> 00:12:29,916
Will you be able to teach?

119
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:39,874
Sun received straight A's. He's the best in his major.

120
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:42,041
You will not be disappointed.

121
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:47,999
I think he's hot-tempered.

122
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:53,874
Punched me last night, I haven't deal with you.

123
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,999
I'll pay for your laundry.

124
00:13:00,042 --> 00:13:02,874
You keep it. Buy yourself some drugs.

125
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,791
What the fuck?

126
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:13,832
Calm down, Sun.

127
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:14,916
I'm not teaching anymore.

128
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:20,916
Actually, I think you can return the money, it's good.

129
00:13:24,917 --> 00:13:29,832
Oh, you used it all, right?

130
00:13:32,917 --> 00:13:34,832
So there is no money to return then?

131
00:13:39,792 --> 00:13:40,916
Let's try study together.

132
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:45,957
But if your friend behaves badly, I will need my money back.

133
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,916
And if you don't return it, I will tell everyone you know.

134
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:55,874
There is definitely no way that it will happen again.

135
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:57,999
Right?

136
00:13:59,917 --> 00:14:00,874
Not sure.

137
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,041
Right, Sun?

138
00:14:16,042 --> 00:14:16,916
Good.

139
00:14:18,917 --> 00:14:19,957
So let's start tutoring right away.

140
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:30,999
Hello. Okay. I'll leave now.

141
00:14:31,792 --> 00:14:32,791
Where are you going?

142
00:14:32,917 --> 00:14:33,957
-I have an urgent class.
-Really?

143
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,832
Umm.

144
00:14:34,917 --> 00:14:36,999
Sun,

145
00:14:39,042 --> 00:14:41,041
Hey! Puth, you're gonna leave me like this?

146
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:42,874
I'll let myself out.

147
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:53,999
What you want me to teach?

148
00:14:55,792 --> 00:14:56,832
So I can prepare properly.

149
00:15:26,042 --> 00:15:26,916
What you want to study?

150
00:15:27,917 --> 00:15:34,832
Next month, a large logistic company will recruit students for internship.

151
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:39,874
I wanted an English teacher who was good at presenting.

152
00:15:40,792 --> 00:15:41,874
So I want a tutor.

153
00:15:41,917 --> 00:15:43,874
Why don't you go find someone top notch?

154
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:48,916
I don't like them.

155
00:15:57,958 --> 00:15:59,832
I want someone who has time.

156
00:16:02,042 --> 00:16:02,957
Then see you tomorrow.

157
00:16:03,792 --> 00:16:04,832
Wait,

158
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,874
come here tomorrow, same time. Don't be late.

159
00:16:14,917 --> 00:16:15,832
I don't like it.

160
00:16:17,042 --> 00:16:17,791
Yes!

161
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:19,957
Wait.

162
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:23,916
What now?

163
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:32,957
When teaching me, address me nicely.

164
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:34,832
I don't like how you talk to me.

165
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,041
Come this way, sir.

166
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:10,832
Wait a minute, please sit and wait here.

167
00:17:10,917 --> 00:17:12,999
Wait a moment.

168
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:20,041
A bell for you. Ring if you need anything.

169
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,791
Sun's pair has arrived.

170
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,874
Then, I will excuse myself.

171
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:32,999
Teacher Sun?

172
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:35,874
Cute name.

173
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:42,916
Then I'll call you Teacher Sun.

174
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:46,832
Yes!

175
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:48,999
Call me what you call..

176
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:56,916
Sorry for being late, Teacher Sun.

177
00:19:04,042 --> 00:19:06,999
Tell others to come on time, you have to act like it too.

178
00:19:11,792 --> 00:19:15,916
Well, I can pay you for the time.

179
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:18,957
Shall we start tutoring?

180
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:21,957
Teacher Sun

181
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:33,874
Well, don't you wanna change first?

182
00:19:40,917 --> 00:19:41,874
Why?

183
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,791
This is cute, no?

184
00:19:55,958 --> 00:19:58,832
Nothing, but change is encouraged.

185
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:11,791
Me?

186
00:22:04,417 --> 00:22:05,416
Teacher Sun.

187
00:22:47,458 --> 00:22:49,374
Are you okay?

188
00:22:49,417 --> 00:22:50,374
Yes.

189
00:22:51,375 --> 00:22:52,457
It's fine.

190
00:22:52,458 --> 00:22:54,249
Is it hurting?

191
00:22:55,292 --> 00:22:58,291
Let me call you an ambulance?

192
00:22:58,375 --> 00:23:00,332
It's fine.

193
00:23:01,292 --> 00:23:02,332
No need to call.

194
00:23:04,375 --> 00:23:05,249
Oh!

195
00:23:05,375 --> 00:23:06,332
Ouch!

196
00:23:07,417 --> 00:23:08,416
Let's start.

197
00:23:16,417 --> 00:23:18,332
Not gonna study?

198
00:23:22,292 --> 00:23:23,374
You okay?

199
00:23:24,417 --> 00:23:26,332
Let's start, then.

200
00:23:27,458 --> 00:23:30,332
Here I've got you some worksheets.

201
00:23:30,375 --> 00:23:32,332
First of all, you have to do a test.

202
00:23:35,458 --> 00:23:37,291
Is there a file?

203
00:23:37,417 --> 00:23:38,416
No.

204
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:42,249
On paper. Do on it, it's convenient.

205
00:23:44,458 --> 00:23:45,499
Okay, let me see.

206
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:57,374
Here.

207
00:23:59,375 --> 00:24:00,332
What?

208
00:24:00,375 --> 00:24:05,291
An iPad, take it with you to my class.

209
00:24:05,458 --> 00:24:06,332
Uh...

210
00:24:09,458 --> 00:24:11,374
Take it.

211
00:24:11,417 --> 00:24:15,290
It's convenient. I gave one to everybody.

212
00:24:16,375 --> 00:24:18,291
Return when the tutoring is done.

213
00:24:25,375 --> 00:24:26,332
Yes!

214
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:32,291
Next time, you put the files in the iPad.

215
00:24:32,292 --> 00:24:36,332
This time, you will do it on paper, okay?

216
00:25:18,417 --> 00:25:20,291
Teacher Sun,

217
00:25:22,375 --> 00:25:23,499
How to solve this?

218
00:25:24,333 --> 00:25:25,457
I can't do it.

219
00:25:28,417 --> 00:25:32,416
This one, this. No.4 with this one.

220
00:25:39,292 --> 00:25:40,374
It's simple.

221
00:25:41,333 --> 00:25:42,457
Change from this one

222
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:45,374
to this one.

223
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:11,291
Hey!

224
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:13,291
I need to go to the bathroom.

225
00:26:46,458 --> 00:26:47,499
Sun.

226
00:26:50,417 --> 00:26:51,457
Teacher Sun.

227
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:53,291
Well...

228
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,374
I'll be there.

229
00:28:13,375 --> 00:28:15,291
Teacher Sun, are you okay?

230
00:28:19,458 --> 00:28:21,249
You're running fever.

231
00:28:23,292 --> 00:28:24,291
It's fine.

232
00:28:25,292 --> 00:28:26,332
It's nothing.

233
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:31,457
If it's nothing, then we

234
00:28:32,333 --> 00:28:33,374
go back to study?

235
00:28:34,458 --> 00:28:36,332
Before we going to study,

236
00:28:37,417 --> 00:28:39,332
Let's eat.

237
00:28:39,458 --> 00:28:42,332
Please.

238
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:48,416
Come here, Teacher Sun. Sit.

239
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:57,499
I'm hungry.

240
00:28:58,458 --> 00:29:00,332
Let's eat.

241
00:29:04,458 --> 00:29:06,332
Can't we finish the test first?

242
00:29:10,375 --> 00:29:12,416
But I'm really hungry.

243
00:29:17,375 --> 00:29:18,499
Pleeeeeeease.

244
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:24,291
If you don't me eat on time, I'm going to have a stomachache.

245
00:29:27,333 --> 00:29:29,374
Yes, let's eat.

246
00:29:33,292 --> 00:29:34,249
A thousand?

247
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:38,416
Okay...

248
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:55,332
Nothing more.

249
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,374
You can take rest now.

250
00:30:05,375 --> 00:30:07,457
Shall we start, Teacher Sun

251
00:30:10,625 --> 00:30:11,291
Eat this.

252
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:16,541
Eat the whole thing.

253
00:30:45,292 --> 00:30:46,374
Teacher Sun

254
00:30:47,292 --> 00:30:48,416
doesn't like vegetables?

255
00:30:49,375 --> 00:30:50,332
Yes!

256
00:30:52,292 --> 00:30:53,457
so can I have them?

257
00:30:55,458 --> 00:30:57,374
I don't like others to eat them for me.

258
00:30:58,417 --> 00:31:00,332
I don't mind.

259
00:31:11,333 --> 00:31:13,291
Nuea.

260
00:31:52,417 --> 00:31:54,332
Why is your heart

261
00:31:55,292 --> 00:31:56,499
skipping beats really hard?

262
00:32:02,375 --> 00:32:04,332
If it's because of anger,

263
00:32:07,333 --> 00:32:08,416
I'm sorry.

264
00:32:12,333 --> 00:32:13,457
But if it's because..

265
00:32:25,542 --> 00:32:26,457
I need to go to the bathroom.

266
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:30,166
Teacher Sun, I'm sorry.

267
00:33:15,292 --> 00:33:16,249
Hey!

268
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:18,499
Why are you here?

269
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:22,374
Brought you a shirt.

270
00:33:24,292 --> 00:33:25,291
I don't want it.

271
00:33:26,375 --> 00:33:28,291
Let's go!

272
00:33:29,458 --> 00:33:31,374
Neat, teacher shirt, Pee Sun.

273
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,416
I'll take it for you.

274
00:33:34,417 --> 00:33:35,416
People like you

275
00:33:36,375 --> 00:33:38,249
Can you wash your clothes?

276
00:33:39,292 --> 00:33:41,291
Teacher Sun doesn't say because at all.

277
00:33:42,458 --> 00:33:45,457
People like that. Can you wash your clothes?

278
00:33:46,333 --> 00:33:47,457
Well, people like younger people.

279
00:33:49,292 --> 00:33:51,249
You just want to take responsibility.

280
00:34:25,375 --> 00:34:30,499
Well, there will be a bow here too. Wait, Teacher Sun, don't forget to tie.

281
00:34:41,333 --> 00:34:43,249
Are you tied? Teacher, P’Sun

282
00:34:44,417 --> 00:34:45,291
are

283
00:34:50,458 --> 00:34:52,291
I'll tie you up.

284
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,416
Is it okay Teacher Sun

285
00:35:23,333 --> 00:35:27,291
Is it too tight? If so, wait for the north to relax.

286
00:35:33,458 --> 00:35:34,416
Is it better?

287
00:35:53,333 --> 00:35:54,374
OK

288
00:35:55,458 --> 00:35:56,499
Finished

289
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:05,291
Teacher Sun loves the most in Lo Lei.

290
00:36:16,292 --> 00:36:17,457
You want to tie this as well?

291
00:38:04,167 --> 00:38:06,957
Hello, Teacher Sun.

292
00:38:07,917 --> 00:38:11,082
Your laundry is done. Don't forget it.

293
00:38:12,542 --> 00:38:13,957
And one more thing...

294
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,990
How do I know if I've done the homework right?

295
00:38:19,917 --> 00:38:21,041
I'll listen to you tomorrow.

296
00:38:21,375 --> 00:38:23,916
If you are in a hurry, take a video clip.

297
00:38:23,917 --> 00:38:28,041
But I'll charge extra as it's after hour work. And a bit extra for Live.

298
00:38:28,958 --> 00:38:30,999
Then I will do a Live.

299
00:38:31,042 --> 00:38:32,041
Now?

300
00:38:32,917 --> 00:38:35,041
Yes, I would like to study now.

301
00:38:36,167 --> 00:38:37,124
Wait a minute.

302
00:38:41,125 --> 00:38:42,166
Damn.

303
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:51,541
Teacher Sun?

304
00:38:51,542 --> 00:38:52,916
Teacher Sun, are you cold?

305
00:38:53,125 --> 00:38:53,916
Very cold.

306
00:38:54,083 --> 00:38:55,124
There's smoke out of your mouth.

307
00:38:58,083 --> 00:38:59,124
What the hell? I'm not cold?

308
00:39:00,958 --> 00:39:02,166
I'm wearing your shirt.

309
00:39:02,958 --> 00:39:04,041
If you know,

310
00:39:04,167 --> 00:39:05,957
you'll get overconfident.

311
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,999
Oh.... I saw that.

312
00:39:10,917 --> 00:39:13,124
Teacher Sun is wearing my shirt.

313
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:14,957
Wanna start now?

314
00:39:15,042 --> 00:39:17,624
Ah, yes.

315
00:39:18,958 --> 00:39:20,999
Reverse Logistics

316
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,916
Is this word correct? Teacher Sun

317
00:39:23,958 --> 00:39:24,916
Right.

318
00:39:25,042 --> 00:39:26,082
Continue.

319
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,124
Hard and warehouse.

320
00:39:29,042 --> 00:39:30,166
Size selection.

321
00:39:31,958 --> 00:39:33,957
Part and service support.

322
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,166
Customer service.

323
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,124
For casting.

324
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,082
Bar code.

325
00:40:25,083 --> 00:40:29,041
What are you smiling at? What so funny?

326
00:40:29,958 --> 00:40:35,082
TBH, you should smile if not others will be afraid you.

327
00:40:37,958 --> 00:40:38,916
Enough.

328
00:40:39,125 --> 00:40:42,957
We'll continue tomorrow, see you.

329
00:40:43,167 --> 00:40:44,124
Good night.

330
00:40:44,125 --> 00:40:51,999
So cute.

331
00:41:01,042 --> 00:41:03,041
Did I just call him cute?

332
00:41:05,167 --> 00:41:07,041
What's wrong with me?

333
00:41:21,958 --> 00:41:23,041
Teacher Sun?

334
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,082
What are you doing?

335
00:41:28,083 --> 00:41:30,916
Watching AIS PLAY.

336
00:41:31,917 --> 00:41:33,124
Are you free this evening?

337
00:41:33,917 --> 00:41:38,040
Can you take me to buy books? I'm worried I'm not choosing the right ones.

338
00:41:38,167 --> 00:41:44,040
I'm busy in the evening, football match.

339
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,124
I'll pay for the wasted time. Please.

340
00:41:56,083 --> 00:41:58,166
Five hundred, not more than 2 hours.

341
00:42:00,083 --> 00:42:01,082
What can you do?

342
00:42:01,083 --> 00:42:04,999
Just walk, no touch, no harassment.

343
00:42:05,167 --> 00:42:09,990
I'm still....

344
00:42:11,958 --> 00:42:13,082
a virgin.

345
00:42:14,958 --> 00:42:18,166
Then see you at 4 o'clock at the bookstore.

346
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,166
And bring it to me.

347
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,082
Teacher Sun.

348
00:43:10,042 --> 00:43:11,957
Do you know that

349
00:43:14,958 --> 00:43:16,957
is a place for my bag.

350
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:20,916
Yeah?

351
00:43:20,958 --> 00:43:23,080
No, you must get up.

352
00:43:23,250 --> 00:43:25,124
Get up. Get up.

353
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:26,957
Get up.

354
00:43:34,958 --> 00:43:41,041
Oh, I forgot to tell you. That place right here, it's also my place.

355
00:43:41,125 --> 00:43:42,916
It's your place too?

356
00:43:43,042 --> 00:43:45,124
Okay, so I'll go sit over there.

357
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:49,082
It's okay.

358
00:43:50,958 --> 00:43:51,916
Sit here.

359
00:44:05,125 --> 00:44:07,082
After all..

360
00:44:09,333 --> 00:44:10,499
Today Teacher Sun is...

361
00:44:12,958 --> 00:44:14,082
Cute.

362
00:45:09,167 --> 00:45:11,082
Teacher Sun, what is it?

363
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:14,041
I just get water to drink.

364
00:45:15,083 --> 00:45:18,041
Stretching. Nothing.

365
00:45:18,042 --> 00:45:18,916
Oh...

366
00:45:18,958 --> 00:45:20,041
So good.

367
00:46:21,125 --> 00:46:22,124
Uh...

368
00:46:24,125 --> 00:46:25,166
Can you start now?

369
00:46:26,083 --> 00:46:28,916
I'd like to drink some water.

370
00:46:44,958 --> 00:46:46,041
Sit and study like this

371
00:46:47,125 --> 00:46:48,957
is alright.

372
00:46:50,083 --> 00:46:51,082
Um...

373
00:46:51,958 --> 00:46:55,082
But do you think it's difficult?

374
00:46:55,917 --> 00:46:57,124
I'll change position.

375
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,041
Okay.

376
00:47:04,958 --> 00:47:06,957
This is fine.

377
00:47:08,083 --> 00:47:09,916
Teacher Sun,

378
00:47:10,042 --> 00:47:11,082
This number,

379
00:47:12,042 --> 00:47:13,957
What's the answer?

380
00:47:15,917 --> 00:47:17,916
Where it asks

381
00:47:18,083 --> 00:47:19,999
Do you love me?

382
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,916
When you're embarrassed,

383
00:47:41,958 --> 00:47:43,041
you're so cute.

384
00:47:43,042 --> 00:47:45,999
I'm not embarrassed.
Who is embarrassed?

385
00:47:46,042 --> 00:47:47,124
Take a break.

386
00:47:47,125 --> 00:47:49,041
Good idea.

387
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,957
Shall we play some game?

388
00:49:10,125 --> 00:49:12,999
Teacher Sun has not given me any homework yet.

389
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:19,082
'Cause you asked for games, now turn to the page before last. The section with Question topic.

390
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:24,166
Where is it? Can you turn on the camera?

391
00:49:43,042 --> 00:49:44,082
Yep, that's it.

392
00:49:44,083 --> 00:49:45,166
Yes, sir.

393
00:49:46,167 --> 00:49:47,041
First of all.

394
00:49:47,958 --> 00:49:48,999
A or B?

395
00:49:51,042 --> 00:49:52,166
A.

396
00:49:53,125 --> 00:49:54,082
Good.

397
00:49:55,958 --> 00:49:56,957
Now do it.

398
00:49:57,125 --> 00:49:58,166
I'll wait and check.

399
00:50:28,125 --> 00:50:29,999
Teacher Sun, what are you smiling at?

400
00:50:31,125 --> 00:50:32,957
I didn't smile a bit.

401
00:50:33,083 --> 00:50:35,082
Don't talk silly. Hurry up and do it.

402
00:50:35,125 --> 00:50:37,082
Are you secretly looking at my face?

403
00:50:37,125 --> 00:50:39,082
What? I didn't intend to do.

404
00:50:39,917 --> 00:50:40,957
How about I won't teach you now?

405
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,124
Teacher Sun, what's behind you?

406
00:50:46,917 --> 00:50:49,082
What do you want? I'm not afraid of childish prank.

407
00:50:49,125 --> 00:50:51,041
Do you see my love?

408
00:50:54,958 --> 00:50:55,957
What are you talking about?

409
00:50:57,917 --> 00:50:58,957
You're being silly.

410
00:50:59,125 --> 00:51:00,999
Want to be my boyfriend?
