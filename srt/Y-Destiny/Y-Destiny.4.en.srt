1
00:02:45,167 --> 00:02:46,207
Here, I give you.

2
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:56,166
Let me see. How you do?

3
00:03:01,167 --> 00:03:02,291
I have done five questions.

4
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:04,124
Where?

5
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:07,291
How is it? All right?

6
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:19,166
You're quite good. All right.

7
00:03:20,292 --> 00:03:24,166
It's known that Nuea is quite good.

8
00:03:26,167 --> 00:03:29,166
You don't say. It's probably more of the teacher.

9
00:03:30,167 --> 00:03:32,166
Touche.

10
00:03:33,167 --> 00:03:37,291
Teacher Sun, The best in the world.

11
00:03:47,292 --> 00:03:49,082
Hurry up. Do it.

12
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:27,207
- I'll take this call.
- Um.

13
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:34,082
What's up, Sun?

14
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:39,207
Hello, Sun, I got pick pocketed.
All of my money was gone.

15
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:41,499
Do you have money for me to borrow?

16
00:04:42,167 --> 00:04:44,291
Pick pocketed? Where?

17
00:04:45,167 --> 00:04:46,124
Are you okay?

18
00:04:48,292 --> 00:04:50,249
If I know where I was pickpocketed,

19
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:52,291
Money wouldn't be lost, right?

20
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:55,166
Last night, I went out with friends.

21
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:58,166
And about dad, I don't dare to tell him.

22
00:04:59,167 --> 00:05:02,166
Call to borrow money but still wanna bother me?

23
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:03,374
Think you gonna get it?

24
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:07,291
Teacher Sun, I'll have a trip soon.

25
00:05:08,167 --> 00:05:10,207
I know that.

26
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:12,416
Can I borrow you four thousand?

27
00:05:13,292 --> 00:05:14,249
I'll transfer it to you.

28
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:16,291
Use wisely.

29
00:05:17,167 --> 00:05:19,166
OK, thank you.

30
00:05:23,292 --> 00:05:25,124
Fuck!

31
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:28,707
I probably won't get to see Save Sunday.

32
00:05:57,125 --> 00:05:58,082
What are you looking at?

33
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:00,082
Nothing.

34
00:06:01,125 --> 00:06:02,166
Focus on you homework.

35
00:06:04,167 --> 00:06:05,082
Okay.

36
00:06:44,167 --> 00:06:45,166
Teacher Sun?

37
00:06:45,292 --> 00:06:47,166
Teacher Sun, are you okay?

38
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:49,374
Why do you look so strange?

39
00:06:52,167 --> 00:06:53,207
Something on your mind?

40
00:07:00,167 --> 00:07:02,249
No, it's fine.

41
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:05,124
Umm.

42
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:26,166
Teacher Sun, let's have a break for food?

43
00:07:26,167 --> 00:07:27,166
I'm hungry.

44
00:07:28,167 --> 00:07:33,124
Please, if I don't eat, I'll have a stomachache.

45
00:07:34,167 --> 00:07:37,166
You eat first. I'm not hungry yet.

46
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:54,082
All my bodyguards are on leave.

47
00:07:58,208 --> 00:08:01,124
Oh, stomachache.

48
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:15,166
What normal person carries noodles around?

49
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:17,749
Poor person?

50
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:20,874
Just eat,

51
00:08:23,167 --> 00:08:24,249
so you won't be hungry.

52
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:29,207
I'm sorry.

53
00:08:30,292 --> 00:08:32,166
I don't mean it like that.

54
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:40,166
But are you really going to eat it raw?

55
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:44,120
Have you no childhood? Never eaten raw noodles?

56
00:08:47,167 --> 00:08:50,166
Then, I hire you to boil it.

57
00:08:55,167 --> 00:08:56,082
A thousand baht.

58
00:08:59,167 --> 00:08:59,999
How many packs?

59
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:04,166
Two.

60
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:06,082
One for you too.

61
00:09:08,292 --> 00:09:09,249
Two thousand, then.

62
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:12,124
Okay.

63
00:09:20,167 --> 00:09:21,082
Only one pack left.

64
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:35,249
Teacher Sun, are you finished?

65
00:10:05,167 --> 00:10:08,166
Teacher Sun, feel better?

66
00:10:10,167 --> 00:10:11,124
Okay.

67
00:10:12,167 --> 00:10:13,166
If you're okay,

68
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:16,082
you have to smile.

69
00:10:18,167 --> 00:10:23,080
Smile.

70
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,082
Do your hands like this, too. Up.

71
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:50,291
You smile and the world just brightened up.

72
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:54,166
We can eat now.

73
00:11:04,167 --> 00:11:05,207
Let me have a taste.

74
00:11:16,167 --> 00:11:17,166
Mellow soup.

75
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:36,249
It's so delicious.

76
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:39,249
Teacher Sun, eat together?

77
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:41,249
Just eat.

78
00:11:42,167 --> 00:11:44,124
Go ahead, I'm not hungry.

79
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:51,666
But you told me you're not hungry.

80
00:11:52,292 --> 00:11:53,249
Teacher Sun.

81
00:12:24,167 --> 00:12:25,374
Please stay still for a while.

82
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:15,166
Mmm, it's delicious.

83
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:20,957
I thought you don't like to share food?

84
00:13:24,167 --> 00:13:28,124
Are we becoming the same person?

85
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:38,916
Are you okay?

86
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:51,791
Who is that?

87
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,999
Hey, I'll sit here.

88
00:15:00,042 --> 00:15:01,957
Lots of news started like this.

89
00:15:02,042 --> 00:15:04,916
Scary stranger? I'll manage.

90
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:19,916
Oh, Teacher Sun came too?

91
00:15:26,042 --> 00:15:29,916
If not, how’d you be talking to me now?

92
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:31,791
Dumb question.

93
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:33,874
- Sun?
- Hmm?

94
00:15:34,042 --> 00:15:35,957
Tell me who this cunt is.

95
00:15:36,917 --> 00:15:40,874
It's the kid that I teach.

96
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,082
How did you get here? Can I go back with you?

97
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,916
It's none of your business.

98
00:16:09,042 --> 00:16:12,999
Sun, I think you should take him home.

99
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:15,374
I'll have Sukh come pick me up.

100
00:16:15,917 --> 00:16:17,874
Nuea.

101
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:20,832
Nuea.

102
00:16:22,917 --> 00:16:23,874
Nuea, go home now.

103
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:32,999
Go home now.

104
00:16:33,917 --> 00:16:36,999
No, I still don't want to leave.

105
00:16:38,042 --> 00:16:42,832
No, no. Be careful, you'll fall.

106
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,916
Not yet! Please.

107
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,957
Five more minutes. Okay?

108
00:16:49,167 --> 00:16:49,916
No.

109
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,874
- Whoo... Teacher Sun.
- This is heavy.

110
00:16:52,917 --> 00:16:54,832
Please go back.

111
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:56,832
No, let's go home. You're so drunk.

112
00:16:56,833 --> 00:16:58,916
No. Don't force me.

113
00:17:05,917 --> 00:17:08,041
Let's go. We'll come here again next time.

114
00:17:08,917 --> 00:17:10,791
I'll bring you.

115
00:17:11,917 --> 00:17:14,832
Now get up. Get up.

116
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:18,916
Come on. Get up quickly.

117
00:17:19,792 --> 00:17:23,957
- Get up.
- If so, can you give me a ride?

118
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:32,832
Please can I have a ride?

119
00:17:33,917 --> 00:17:35,957
Teacher Sun, Please.

120
00:17:37,958 --> 00:17:38,957
Please.

121
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:40,916
Fine.

122
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:43,832
You're the cutest!

123
00:17:45,917 --> 00:17:47,957
Compliment on the shy guy.

124
00:17:48,917 --> 00:17:49,832
Come.

125
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:57,874
Hurry up. One, two, three.

126
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:05,957
Nuea.

127
00:18:11,875 --> 00:18:12,832
This is rough.

128
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:17,832
Fine. I'll carry you.

129
00:18:21,792 --> 00:18:22,916
Come here, come on.

130
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,874
Hold on tight if you don't want to go down the drain.

131
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:34,916
One, two, three.

132
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:45,832
Hold well, Stubborn.

133
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,041
Go!

134
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:09,957
What will the stubborn kid going to get?

135
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:30,874
Go.

136
00:19:32,792 --> 00:19:33,832
Teacher Sun,

137
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,791
you're cute.

138
00:19:36,042 --> 00:19:37,957
You're cute.

139
00:19:39,167 --> 00:19:40,874
You're cute.

140
00:19:42,042 --> 00:19:44,832
You're the cutest.

141
00:19:45,792 --> 00:19:46,791
Go.

142
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:49,957
Teacher Sun is so cute.

143
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:14,999
Hey.

144
00:21:51,958 --> 00:21:52,916
I'll leave.

145
00:22:01,875 --> 00:22:04,791
No. No one is leaving.

146
00:22:11,958 --> 00:22:14,957
Teacher Sun, don't leave me yet.

147
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,916
You're too drunk. Take a rest.

148
00:22:44,833 --> 00:22:46,832
Teacher Sun,

149
00:22:47,958 --> 00:22:52,916
when you smile, you're so cute.

150
00:23:00,042 --> 00:23:02,041
Teacher Sun, can you smile more often?

151
00:23:06,833 --> 00:23:07,957
This student

152
00:23:12,042 --> 00:23:13,874
loves you Teacher Sun.

153
00:24:11,792 --> 00:24:14,999
Hey!

154
00:25:35,875 --> 00:25:37,999
Good night.

155
00:25:38,875 --> 00:25:39,874
Stubborn student.

156
00:27:30,917 --> 00:27:31,874
Good night.

157
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,041
Stubborn student.

158
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:20,332
Teacher Sun..

159
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:31,291
Sun, why the fuck are you shaking for?

160
00:28:51,292 --> 00:28:52,332
He, see you.

161
00:28:52,333 --> 00:28:53,332
Huh

162
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:57,207
Sum! Sun!

163
00:28:58,167 --> 00:28:59,207
What?

164
00:29:57,167 --> 00:29:58,166
Thank you.

165
00:30:05,167 --> 00:30:07,291
Teacher Sun, today...

166
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:13,249
you look neat

167
00:30:25,125 --> 00:30:27,124
but...

168
00:30:38,125 --> 00:30:40,166
last night you looked neater!

169
00:30:51,167 --> 00:30:52,166
So...

170
00:30:55,167 --> 00:30:58,291
What else do you remember last night?

171
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:07,166
I can't remember.

172
00:31:07,292 --> 00:31:09,207
Oh.

173
00:31:09,208 --> 00:31:14,291
I have to ask the security guard to know that you dropped me off.

174
00:31:15,292 --> 00:31:17,332
So I want to thank you.

175
00:31:19,167 --> 00:31:20,166
It's okay.

176
00:31:20,167 --> 00:31:22,207
Teacher Sun, what are you doing here?

177
00:31:23,333 --> 00:31:25,207
Come see me?

178
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:28,332
I'm not. Here for the bathroom.

179
00:31:28,333 --> 00:31:32,249
The bathroom here is comfy. I like it.

180
00:31:34,125 --> 00:31:35,249
Oh...

181
00:31:37,167 --> 00:31:41,207
So see you tonight at our condo.

182
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:48,124
Oh dear! I mean our classroom.

183
00:32:05,292 --> 00:32:07,249
It's so hard.

184
00:32:09,167 --> 00:32:11,207
I'm bored, Teacher Sun.

185
00:32:11,292 --> 00:32:13,207
And I'm hungry too.

186
00:32:24,167 --> 00:32:27,124
Bored already?

187
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:29,166
You can take a rest.

188
00:32:29,625 --> 00:32:31,166
And..

189
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:33,207
When you feel better, we'll continue.

190
00:32:34,333 --> 00:32:37,291
Why are you so kind today?

191
00:32:37,333 --> 00:32:39,200
You let me rest

192
00:32:39,292 --> 00:32:41,249
and did not hurry to teach.

193
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:45,124
So every time I was mean?

194
00:32:50,542 --> 00:32:51,207
Yes!

195
00:32:57,167 --> 00:32:59,166
I'm kidding.

196
00:32:59,292 --> 00:33:05,166
Teacher Sun is both the cutest and kindest.

197
00:33:06,333 --> 00:33:08,124
Am I bothering you?

198
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:12,166
I really mean it.

199
00:33:12,333 --> 00:33:14,249
That you are

200
00:33:15,167 --> 00:33:19,291
both the cutest and kindest.

201
00:33:19,292 --> 00:33:22,249
Here it is.

202
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:24,166
Nuea!

203
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:27,166
You'll pay for this!

204
00:33:28,125 --> 00:33:29,332
You will be cuter than this

205
00:33:31,125 --> 00:33:33,124
if you happened to make noodles for me.

206
00:33:33,458 --> 00:33:35,124
Are you using me?

207
00:33:39,167 --> 00:33:42,207
Please. Pleeeease.

208
00:33:43,167 --> 00:33:44,249
Please..

209
00:33:45,167 --> 00:33:46,166
Okay

210
00:33:47,167 --> 00:33:48,332
but...

211
00:33:50,208 --> 00:33:53,166
say those words again

212
00:33:53,292 --> 00:33:55,207
that I'm cute.

213
00:33:58,292 --> 00:34:06,291
Teacher Sun is so cute. Teacher Sun is so cute. Cute!

214
00:34:11,125 --> 00:34:13,207
That's too much!

215
00:34:15,250 --> 00:34:17,332
It's cute.

216
00:34:33,167 --> 00:34:34,332
Here.

217
00:34:37,167 --> 00:34:38,291
Teacher Sun is so cute.

218
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:41,291
Teacher Sun is the cutest.

219
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:45,249
Erm...

220
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:47,166
Shall we eat?

221
00:34:53,208 --> 00:34:54,249
Ouch!

222
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:56,416
- Teacher Sun
- What's wrong?

223
00:34:57,167 --> 00:34:58,207
My finger hurts.

224
00:34:58,208 --> 00:34:59,207
What is it?

225
00:34:59,208 --> 00:35:00,291
The plate is hot.

226
00:35:00,292 --> 00:35:01,249
Want me to blow for you?

227
00:35:01,292 --> 00:35:03,291
I probably can't eat by myself.

228
00:35:04,167 --> 00:35:06,332
How are you going to eat? My finger hurts.

229
00:35:07,125 --> 00:35:10,166
Teacher Sun will feed you.

230
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:12,166
Please feed me.

231
00:35:12,208 --> 00:35:14,166
Come. I'll feed you.

232
00:35:16,167 --> 00:35:17,249
Be careful, it's hot.

233
00:35:38,125 --> 00:35:39,166
Is it delicious?

234
00:35:40,458 --> 00:35:41,291
Yes.

235
00:35:46,167 --> 00:35:47,332
Teacher Sun, don't you eat?

236
00:35:49,167 --> 00:35:50,332
I'll feed you.

237
00:35:54,167 --> 00:35:57,249
Eat. Eat. Eat together.

238
00:36:05,667 --> 00:36:06,332
Just one?

239
00:36:07,125 --> 00:36:08,207
Ah....

240
00:37:34,125 --> 00:37:36,291
can eat by myself.

241
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:45,207
Oh!

242
00:37:46,167 --> 00:37:47,249
Shit! Nuae's homework.

243
00:37:53,167 --> 00:37:55,166
I thought so...

244
00:38:08,208 --> 00:38:09,249
Master Nuea is here.

245
00:38:09,292 --> 00:38:12,249
People that love each other, do they really do this?

246
00:38:13,208 --> 00:38:14,624
I'm sorry that I didn't tell you.

247
00:38:16,125 --> 00:38:19,410
I'm afraid you'd be worried about me.

248
00:38:24,125 --> 00:38:25,249
Don't be mad.

249
00:38:27,167 --> 00:38:30,166
Umm...

250
00:38:35,208 --> 00:38:37,166
Okay...

251
00:38:51,125 --> 00:38:52,166
I won't be.

252
00:39:34,292 --> 00:39:38,166
Teacher Sun? This name is cute.

253
00:39:50,125 --> 00:39:51,291
Why is Teacher Sun's heart

254
00:39:52,292 --> 00:39:54,332
beat so hard?

255
00:40:01,292 --> 00:40:04,166
Teacher Sun is the cutest in the world.

256
00:40:05,333 --> 00:40:08,291
When teacher Sun is embarrassed,

257
00:40:09,292 --> 00:40:11,207
you're so cute.

258
00:40:13,208 --> 00:40:15,291
This student

259
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:18,166
is in love with you, Teacher Sun.

260
00:40:22,208 --> 00:40:25,166
People who love each other, do they really do this?

261
00:41:33,458 --> 00:41:34,499
Teacher Sun,

262
00:41:36,583 --> 00:41:38,499
I'm done.

263
00:41:39,667 --> 00:41:41,457
Let me check it out.

264
00:42:00,458 --> 00:42:01,499
Boop...

265
00:42:03,667 --> 00:42:04,666
Hey!

266
00:42:11,625 --> 00:42:14,582
Oh... today you're rough.

267
00:42:15,583 --> 00:42:16,541
Boop!

268
00:42:16,583 --> 00:42:18,666
How about this?!

269
00:42:19,458 --> 00:42:20,624
Told you not to do this.

270
00:42:21,458 --> 00:42:22,499
am examining the exam.

271
00:42:22,625 --> 00:42:24,416
I need to focus.

272
00:42:36,667 --> 00:42:38,624
Teacher Sun, what is it?

273
00:42:40,417 --> 00:42:42,541
Did I do anything to make you mad?

274
00:42:47,625 --> 00:42:49,541
If I do something wrong,

275
00:42:52,458 --> 00:42:53,582
I'm sorry.

276
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:05,666
Teacher Sun,

277
00:43:08,458 --> 00:43:10,499
Tomorrow I have an interview exam.

278
00:43:11,583 --> 00:43:13,624
Teacher Sun, can you go with me?...

279
00:43:24,667 --> 00:43:26,582
Said not to touch.

280
00:43:29,833 --> 00:43:30,582
No...

281
00:43:31,542 --> 00:43:33,541
You probably had someone else to go with.

282
00:44:05,542 --> 00:44:10,416
How many lessons do we have left?

283
00:44:31,625 --> 00:44:33,499
This time is the last time.

284
00:44:37,542 --> 00:44:40,499
If I pay for more lessons,

285
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:43,541
will you teach me?

286
00:44:48,458 --> 00:44:49,624
Enough of this.

287
00:44:53,458 --> 00:44:57,666
You're the worst student I've ever taught.

288
00:45:05,458 --> 00:45:08,499
But Teacher Sun is the best teacher for me.

289
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:27,416
Good luck tomorrow.

290
00:46:30,583 --> 00:46:32,457
As for the exam..

291
00:46:35,417 --> 00:46:37,874
I finished checking them. I'll bring it to you other day.

292
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:43,541
But if Teacher Sun is still free....

293
00:46:45,542 --> 00:46:47,374
I want you to come.

294
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:40,541
Sun, your last tuition money.

295
00:47:45,542 --> 00:47:46,582
Thank you.

296
00:47:50,667 --> 00:47:56,457
Though I got money, it's not enough for Save Sunday tickets.

297
00:47:58,500 --> 00:47:59,541
Yeah..

298
00:48:00,542 --> 00:48:04,499
You won't go cheer Nuea up?

299
00:48:04,667 --> 00:48:06,624
Even though I came with my student.

300
00:48:11,667 --> 00:48:16,499
I think there is someone else to do that.

301
00:48:18,625 --> 00:48:21,416
Okay, see you then.

302
00:48:21,542 --> 00:48:22,582
See you.

303
00:48:44,625 --> 00:48:46,582
Teacher Sun, wait for me.

304
00:48:57,542 --> 00:49:00,457
Teacher Sun! Teacher Sun!

305
00:49:01,792 --> 00:49:02,666
Teacher Sun!

306
00:49:13,542 --> 00:49:15,541
You said you would not come.

307
00:49:16,542 --> 00:49:18,499
Just in the neighborhood.

308
00:49:19,542 --> 00:49:22,499
Just tell me, you came for me.

309
00:49:25,542 --> 00:49:28,499
Fine... I came for you

310
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:35,541
to...

311
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:38,582
return your marked exam and the iPad.

312
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:03,624
Everyone,

313
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:08,416
many people sent a message asking

314
00:50:09,833 --> 00:50:12,416
How did I pass this interview?

315
00:50:13,458 --> 00:50:15,416
I want to tell everyone that...

316
00:50:15,542 --> 00:50:17,666
behind my success,

317
00:50:18,667 --> 00:50:20,582
there is one person.

318
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:24,582
And that person is...

319
00:50:27,542 --> 00:50:29,541
- Teacher Sun
- Hey!

320
00:50:32,625 --> 00:50:35,450
Both good teaching and super cute.

321
00:50:37,625 --> 00:50:39,582
Definitely worth more than the price.

322
00:50:40,542 --> 00:50:43,874
But if anyone wants to study with him,

323
00:50:44,458 --> 00:50:46,457
you have to ask for a permission

324
00:50:46,542 --> 00:50:47,666
from me.

325
00:50:48,458 --> 00:50:49,666
Only me.

326
00:50:50,583 --> 00:50:53,416
Hey! What the fuck are you saying?

327
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:54,666
Who gave you that right?

328
00:50:56,625 --> 00:50:58,457
Enough...

329
00:50:59,458 --> 00:51:00,624
Teacher Sun,

330
00:51:05,458 --> 00:51:06,666
I like you.

331
00:51:09,458 --> 00:51:10,582
How?

332
00:51:11,542 --> 00:51:13,499
You already have a someone.

333
00:51:13,625 --> 00:51:15,624
How can you have someone

334
00:51:16,417 --> 00:51:18,499
when I am waiting for you.

335
00:51:19,875 --> 00:51:21,416
So...

336
00:51:21,625 --> 00:51:23,624
the person I saw the day before.

337
00:51:24,542 --> 00:51:29,624
I didn't tell you 'cause I don't want to worry you.

338
00:51:35,542 --> 00:51:36,666
Oh...

339
00:51:37,458 --> 00:51:41,457
That person Team. He's a senior.

340
00:51:41,625 --> 00:51:43,624
He is studying Communication Arts.

341
00:51:44,458 --> 00:51:45,666
I helped him with the dialogue.

342
00:51:45,667 --> 00:51:46,666
Brother Team.

343
00:51:47,417 --> 00:51:47,957
Hmm?

344
00:51:48,458 --> 00:51:51,457
My dialogue is okay?

345
00:51:52,667 --> 00:51:54,457
Sure.

346
00:51:55,542 --> 00:51:56,582
Thank you.

347
00:51:59,458 --> 00:52:00,624
Even though...

348
00:52:01,458 --> 00:52:06,624
You were acting strange because you secretly heard me, right?

349
00:52:07,542 --> 00:52:08,499
Well..

350
00:52:09,458 --> 00:52:10,666
Can't one be jealous?

351
00:52:14,583 --> 00:52:15,624
So...

352
00:52:17,458 --> 00:52:18,666
When did it start?

353
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:21,541
First semester.

354
00:52:22,625 --> 00:52:24,624
At freshman's social,

355
00:52:25,417 --> 00:52:27,791
we were blindfolded and had to pass paper with our mouth.

356
00:52:29,458 --> 00:52:31,541
was after you

357
00:52:33,458 --> 00:52:34,541
and you...

358
00:52:34,667 --> 00:52:36,624
accidentally kiss me.

359
00:52:38,542 --> 00:52:40,541
That kiss was my first kiss

360
00:52:40,625 --> 00:52:42,582
That you stole.

361
00:52:44,542 --> 00:52:46,666
I will never forget.

362
00:52:52,583 --> 00:52:54,457
After that..

363
00:52:54,542 --> 00:52:56,490
I just did a dig on you

364
00:52:57,417 --> 00:53:01,457
until I knew that you're in the 2nd year

365
00:53:02,417 --> 00:53:04,457
but disguised yourself as other year.

366
00:53:04,667 --> 00:53:07,541
And if I didn't come to teach,

367
00:53:08,417 --> 00:53:09,582
will you tell me?

368
00:53:10,583 --> 00:53:12,457
The truth is..

369
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:16,416
me and Puth arranged this so you come teach me.

370
00:53:16,417 --> 00:53:17,541
Hey, I lost my wallet.

371
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:23,582
You must won lots of bets.

372
00:53:23,625 --> 00:53:26,666
It's you. You let me bet on this match.

373
00:53:27,458 --> 00:53:28,624
I believe that

374
00:53:29,625 --> 00:53:32,499
if we get closer,

375
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,457
you might like me.

376
00:53:36,625 --> 00:53:41,166
Destiny can be determined with what you choose.

377
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:43,582
Fucking Puth.

378
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:46,916
He planned to sell me on right from the start?

379
00:53:48,667 --> 00:53:51,541
About that night when I was drunk,

380
00:53:52,583 --> 00:53:54,582
I can remember everything.

381
00:53:57,542 --> 00:54:02,499
This student loves you Teacher Sun.

382
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:13,624
Teacher Sun also likes me too, right?

383
00:54:14,625 --> 00:54:16,624
I didn't think by yourself, right?

384
00:54:19,667 --> 00:54:21,457
Maybe...

385
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:23,541
I like you..

386
00:54:37,542 --> 00:54:39,457
Since when?

387
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:45,582
Since the trip to buy a book.

388
00:54:46,417 --> 00:54:50,499
Thank you for helping me choose a book.

389
00:54:53,542 --> 00:54:55,541
What is the answer

390
00:54:56,458 --> 00:55:00,541
to the question, Do You Love Me?

391
00:55:07,542 --> 00:55:08,624
Did you read some?

392
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:11,416
Huh, a lazy ass.

393
00:55:12,417 --> 00:55:13,666
I read every word.

394
00:55:14,625 --> 00:55:16,499
Which chapter do you like the most?

395
00:55:16,833 --> 00:55:18,582
I like the chapter that says...

396
00:55:20,458 --> 00:55:22,416
Someone loves someone.

397
00:55:23,583 --> 00:55:25,499
Someone love two.

398
00:55:26,792 --> 00:55:28,582
But I love one.

399
00:55:29,625 --> 00:55:31,541
That one is you.

400
00:55:35,625 --> 00:55:38,666
Do you know the translation?

401
00:55:40,417 --> 00:55:41,624
You know.

402
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:45,582
You're not that bad.

403
00:55:48,625 --> 00:55:50,582
If you know, what does it mean?

404
00:55:52,583 --> 00:55:54,582
Some people love only 1 person.

405
00:55:56,583 --> 00:55:58,624
Some people love 2 people.

406
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:03,541
But I love only one person

407
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:08,416
And that person is Teacher Sun.

408
00:56:10,417 --> 00:56:11,499
I'm gonna throw up.

409
00:56:11,583 --> 00:56:13,457
Worse translation ever.

410
00:56:13,708 --> 00:56:15,624
But you likey likey?

411
00:56:21,417 --> 00:56:23,541
Umm... I don't know.

412
00:56:24,458 --> 00:56:28,374
I don't know. Why are you asking like this?

413
00:57:11,542 --> 00:57:15,457
Just a glimpse for today.

414
00:57:15,458 --> 00:57:17,541
Let's talk again, everyone.

415
00:57:30,667 --> 00:57:34,416
Stubborn student, will you be my boyfriend?

416
00:57:34,583 --> 00:57:36,499
No prob, Teacher.

417
00:58:02,625 --> 00:58:03,624
Hey!

418
00:58:36,667 --> 00:58:39,624
Several weeks later.

419
00:58:39,625 --> 00:58:40,624
What are you doing?

420
00:58:41,625 --> 00:58:43,541
Let go of Prem's hand.

421
00:58:44,417 --> 00:58:46,541
Umm...

422
00:58:46,667 --> 00:58:48,416
Nope!

423
00:58:50,625 --> 00:58:52,541
Release!

424
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:55,457
Why should I?

425
00:58:57,667 --> 00:58:59,541
Nope!

426
00:59:02,417 --> 00:59:03,416
Bro.

427
00:59:04,458 --> 00:59:06,416
Can't you walk by yourself?

428
00:59:38,625 --> 00:59:41,457
What is your problem, Teacher Sun?

429
00:59:55,500 --> 00:59:56,624
Feed me please.

430
00:59:59,500 --> 01:00:02,457
- Eat by yourself .
- Feed me please.

431
01:00:06,625 --> 01:00:08,582
Are you wearing perfume?

432
01:00:09,625 --> 01:00:11,457
Well..

433
01:00:11,625 --> 01:00:13,499
so we get a good night sleep.

434
01:00:13,542 --> 01:00:16,582
But normally I don't see you take a shower.

435
01:00:19,667 --> 01:00:21,624
I take a shower every day!

436
01:00:22,625 --> 01:00:24,541
Can I eat with you?

437
01:00:39,583 --> 01:00:41,582
Pick it up by yourself.

438
01:00:46,583 --> 01:00:50,582
What is wrong with you? I was going to watch TV?

439
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:56,410
Hello everyone. You're with Copy A News.

440
01:00:56,417 --> 01:00:57,624
With Spire Samon Sakdiwong.

441
01:00:57,625 --> 01:01:00,499
A moment ago, the scholars have said that

442
01:01:00,542 --> 01:01:04,416
the Destiny meteor shower has almost reached Thailand.

443
01:01:04,458 --> 01:01:06,582
Can be watched as you look to the north.

444
01:01:06,625 --> 01:01:08,580
Oh my god! And surprise!

445
01:01:08,583 --> 01:01:10,457
- Teacher Sun
- Hmm?

446
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:12,624
See the meteor shower with me?

447
01:01:13,542 --> 01:01:15,666
My room is in the north.

448
01:01:17,583 --> 01:01:18,582
Yeah?

449
01:01:22,583 --> 01:01:25,416
Eat, with open mouth. Eat!

450
01:01:27,417 --> 01:01:28,416
Eat or no?

451
01:01:28,542 --> 01:01:29,582
Eat!

452
01:01:30,458 --> 01:01:31,499
Just that!

453
01:01:31,625 --> 01:01:32,666
So mean!

454
01:01:34,417 --> 01:01:36,499
- Leave now
- I'll go too.

455
01:01:36,583 --> 01:01:37,582
Get up!

456
01:01:37,667 --> 01:01:38,582
Go!

457
01:01:39,417 --> 01:01:40,416
I'll go too.

458
01:01:44,542 --> 01:01:45,582
Teacher Sun,

459
01:01:45,625 --> 01:01:47,666
that's the meteor shower.

460
01:01:48,458 --> 01:01:49,499
Hurry up and pray.

461
01:01:49,542 --> 01:01:52,666
They said that wishes made to a shooting star will be true.

462
01:01:52,667 --> 01:01:53,624
Umm...

463
01:02:26,625 --> 01:02:28,624
Teacher Sun, you done praying?

464
01:02:30,583 --> 01:02:32,582
What do you pray for?

465
01:02:34,542 --> 01:02:35,624
Pray that...

466
01:02:36,542 --> 01:02:37,582
tonight

467
01:02:38,500 --> 01:02:40,541
I want hug the North Star all night long.

468
01:02:41,458 --> 01:02:42,582
Do you think

469
01:02:43,458 --> 01:02:44,499
it will it be true?

470
01:02:48,542 --> 01:02:51,457
And what do you pray for?

471
01:02:57,583 --> 01:02:59,541
I prayed for

472
01:03:00,667 --> 01:03:04,457
the hugs from you forever.

473
01:03:07,625 --> 01:03:08,624
So...

474
01:03:09,625 --> 01:03:10,624
Tonight

475
01:03:11,542 --> 01:03:14,624
Let's make the prayers some true.
