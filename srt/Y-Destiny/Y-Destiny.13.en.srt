1
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,239
Choke, why did we stop being friends?

2
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:15,980
What's disgusting?

3
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:16,999
I don't know. What's happening?

4
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:20,239
Don't know or it's normal to you? Go back and watch it yourself.

5
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:24,039
If possible, I wish this never happened.

6
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:32,159
Masuk's story

7
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,119
Are you Dao?

8
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,119
Flowers for you.

9
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,999
Have we known each other before?

10
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,159
No. Never.

11
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,119
No? So why did you bring me flowers?
Picking me up?

12
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:01,039
Well, I'm a Happy delivery man from Send Love, Serving Love.

13
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:06,159
Khun Chang asked me to bring you flowers.

14
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,079
He's sitting there.

15
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,159
Flowers.

16
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,159
Hello, bro.

17
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,119
What's up, Masuk?

18
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,999
You've change your ring tone.

19
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,199
Umm.

20
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:07,110
Mission to deliver happiness, done.

21
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,119
Okay.

22
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:10,959
Yes, sir.

23
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,519
Uncle?

24
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,039
What's up young man?

25
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,119
I bought you some rice.

26
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,119
Thank you very much.

27
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:47,039
Oh...it's very hot today.

28
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,079
- True, uncle.
- Umm.

29
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,239
- So, uncle?
- Hmm?

30
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,239
Besides food, I bought a mobile fan for you.

31
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:04,079
Makes you cool and you can work your hands.

32
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,039
Thank you very much.

33
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:15,079
OK. So...

34
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,159
There's no class today?

35
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,999
I just made a delivery.

36
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,039
I'm going to go up to work.

37
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,199
- Well, I'll excuse myself, uncle.
- Umm.

38
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,199
Thank you very much.

39
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,079
See you.

40
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,039
Hi, bro.

41
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,159
Oh, Masuk, hello.

42
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,199
Be right back.

43
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,199
Flowers delivery, how is it?

44
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,079
It's okay.

45
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,119
The customers don't like it much.

46
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,039
Why? She didn't like the arrangement?

47
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,119
Or she's allergic?

48
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,519
She didn't like the one who ordered it for her.

49
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:52,039
Of course, Dao is a faculty cheerleader. She's way out of league.

50
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,239
Don't think too much.

51
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,199
Masuk.

52
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,199
Next week it's Valentine's Day. Any plan?

53
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,239
No plan.

54
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,199
Can you help me with something?

55
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:57,119
The store will be busy. Pongpaeng will leave to be with his lover.

56
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,159
Oh...

57
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,159
Can you not be sarcastic?

58
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:11,119
You've been here for three years. I've never asked for anything.

59
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:16,119
This will be the first time I have a date. Let me go.

60
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,159
Please. Please. Please. Please.

61
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,199
- Let your brother go.
- Yeah.

62
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,199
Go on date. Go on date. Go on date.

63
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,159
I can help. I don't have any plan.

64
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,199
But if you have a boyfriend, I won't see you again, right?

65
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,199
How can it be? Who will take me?

66
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:57,119
But how about you, do you have plans?

67
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,159
You can tell me. I'll watch the shop.

68
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:08,039
No, even if there is, I won't go.

69
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,239
Now is the time to make money.

70
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,119
I'm going to work.

71
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,039
What are you doing here alone?

72
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,039
What's wrong with you?
Why do you look so sad?

73
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:31,639
What's up?

74
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:37,199
My face has always like this. My eyes are always so sad.

75
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:41,199
So how is your life these days?

76
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,239
There are ups and downs.

77
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:53,159
Good and bad days? Why do you ask?

78
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,239
Are you lonely?

79
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:02,719
I am.

80
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,079
Let's go to the church, brother?

81
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,039
What do you want me to do there?

82
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:15,199
Make a wish for a partner for you.

83
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,239
Nonsense, Sat.

84
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,079
There's no such thing, wishes.

85
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:30,999
It's real, bro. A wish from the past to the future

86
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:37,999
and from the future back to the past. Also, true.

87
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:41,039
Stop it now.

88
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,919
I don't believe things that can't be proved.

89
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,119
Maybe my soul mate wasn't born yet.

90
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,999
No. It could be someone close to you

91
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,319
or being someone in the shop.

92
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:15,039
Why is the new wrapping method so hard?

93
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,119
You're too impatient. Take a break first.

94
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,839
Oh, Masuk.

95
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:26,199
Come, Masuk, come on, sit down, sit here.

96
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:31,039
Masuk study with your bro.

97
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:36,999
'cause on Valentine's Day I'll leave anyway.

98
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:41,039
Are you sneaking away? Going to talk to your boyfriend?

99
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,239
Stay with your boyfriend.

100
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:59,039
What boyfriend? Go wherever you want, go.

101
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,639
He talks nonsense. Don't pay attention.

102
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:17,039
Let him go. I'll study with you.

103
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:23,199
So I can wrap it for customers on Valentine's Day.

104
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,239
Come now, I'll teach you.

105
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,199
Tie the key like this.

106
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:35,039
Tie like a bow, Masuk. Easy tie.

107
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,079
That's all.

108
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,039
Try.

109
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,119
Alright, I'll try to wrap it up.

110
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:53,119
But I'm not sure if I remember.

111
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,119
It's okay, you can do it slowly.

112
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,199
Let's do it together.

113
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,159
Done,.

114
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,039
Nice.

115
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:40,020
If you're this bored,

116
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,999
why don't you look for someone?

117
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,239
- Masuk?
- Bro?

118
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,399
Have plan after this?

119
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,319
No, sir.

120
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,239
Bro, what's up?

121
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:21,999
I will go out to buy some stuff.

122
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,319
Can you come with me?

123
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,279
Okay.

124
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,319
Go.

125
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,439
Bro?

126
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,199
You said we're going to buy stuff?

127
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,759
Why did you bring me to the cinema?

128
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,279
I didn't come to buy anything special.

129
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:06,319
Just wanna look for ideas for the store.

130
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,319
In the cinema.

131
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,319
Umm.

132
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,279
Masuk?

133
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,399
What's up?

134
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:36,359
What do you do when you're bored or lonely?

135
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:44,359
I didn't do anything.

136
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:53,319
I went on a bus to the end of the line and come back.

137
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,239
That's weird.

138
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,319
What did you get from it?

139
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:14,399
I can see other people's lives.

140
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,399
Some people's lives are worse than ours.

141
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,839
And some people's are better than us.

142
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:38,599
If you're that bored, why don't look for someone?

143
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,439
My soul mate wasn't even born yet.

144
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,439
Masuk?

145
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,439
Masuk?

146
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,279
Masuk?

147
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,239
You're okay?

148
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,359
Go, bro.

149
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:48,959
Go.

150
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,399
Hello, Tir.

151
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:57,279
Masuk, I bought tickets already.

152
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,199
I booked us our spots.

153
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:05,199
Wait for me a little. One more delivery.

154
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:13,319
Won't take long, right? I don't want to watch movies alone today.

155
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:23,399
Hope we will see each other today.

156
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,399
Come fast, Masuk.

157
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,359
You don't have to bring a sweater.

158
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,239
I brought it for you.

159
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,439
Sat?

160
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:12,279
Brother, let me in.

161
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,199
Come in.

162
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,239
P'Masuk?

163
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,399
Are you okay?

164
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,439
I'm ok.

165
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,399
Are you sure?

166
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:08,359
I called you many times. You don't pick up.

167
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:15,399
I think your phone is not good.

168
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:19,239
So why are you here for?

169
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:24,239
The gang is having dinner on the roof.

170
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,279
So I came to invite you to eat with us.

171
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:29,399
Wanna join?

172
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:38,279
Well, today I don't want...

173
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:43,239
Let's go, brother. I insist.

174
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:45,359
Please.

175
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,319
- Come with me?
- Fine.

176
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,199
I'll go.

177
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,359
- Okay?
- Yeah.

178
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,399
Go.

179
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,399
- Puth?
- Umm.

180
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,239
So where did Sun go?

181
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:21,199
Sun? He's super addicted to Nuea.

182
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:25,439
I don't want to gossip.

183
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,279
About?

184
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,239
- Tell me.
- OK.

185
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:37,319
Sun told me that Nuea

186
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,359
is super hot.

187
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,359
Wow.

188
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,319
As hot as Ake?

189
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,319
Not as good as P'Team, I'm sure.

190
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,319
As hot as Pae?

191
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,319
Fine, he's not that hot then.

192
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:53,959
Let's eat.

193
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,279
P'Masuk has arrived.

194
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,519
- P'Masuk, hi.
- P'Masuk hello.

195
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,399
Ok, come here.

196
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:10,399
You're quite good to drag your code brother here.

197
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:29,239
Masuk?

198
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:30,399
Are you crying again?

199
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,359
Don't tell me you're crying...

200
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:04,359
Masuk?

201
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,319
He used to have a boyfriend, when he was a freshman...

202
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:16,399
But... his boyfriend died.

203
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:41,439
Masuk.

204
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,279
Are you crying again?

205
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:48,439
Don't tell me that it's because...

206
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,319
Sat!

207
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,319
What are you doing here?

208
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:19,399
Pour some water for your brother...

209
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,359
Third...

210
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:55,359
- Yes.
- You don't opened your fortune teller biz?

211
00:31:56,440 --> 00:32:05,310
- P'Puth, since Thurs has a boyfriend, he can't foretell.
- Mon, shut up.

212
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:11,399
- I didn't do it anymore. My boyfriend won't let me.
- Oh...

213
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:15,239
That's good...

214
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,399
So you can stop deceiving other people!

215
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:25,199
Can see the past and the future?

216
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,399
Bullshit.

217
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:35,239
Whoa... P'Masuk, it's real.

218
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:39,239
If it happened to you, you'll understand.

219
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:41,839
Yes, brother...

220
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:45,399
Miracles do exist.

221
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,399
Alright guys!

222
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,039
I don't believe...

223
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,279
If miracles are real,

224
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:03,279
when I asked for it, it would happen.

225
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:13,399
Oh brother! One day, it will happen to you.

226
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:23,199
I think it's too late

227
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:28,199
Even if it actually happens now...

228
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,399
there's nothing better.

229
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:39,399
I don't believe in miracles.

230
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,199
See you later. I have class in the morning.

231
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,439
Brother...

232
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:25,319
Did we say something wrong?

233
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,199
Yes...

234
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:31,239
Because of the miracle?

235
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,359
Don't blame me...

236
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:35,399
We both did.

237
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,439
Brother Puth!

238
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:51,239
What's up with you, Masuk?

239
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,439
Yeah, bro...

240
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,319
So...

241
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,279
Will you really gonna tell me?

242
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:23,319
We are all brothers here.

243
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:31,199
Tell them yourself.

244
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:47,199
Masuk..

245
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:52,359
used to have a boyfriend

246
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,279
but...

247
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:05,319
his boyfriend was dead!

248
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,439
Huh...

249
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,359
And...

250
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:23,279
when his boyfriend died...

251
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,359
he tried to beg...

252
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,439
made a wish

253
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,439
prayed.

254
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,279
He did everything he can

255
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:41,319
so his boyfriend will come back...

256
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,399
But he never did!

257
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,239
Since then...

258
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:07,239
it wouldn't open up to anyone else.

259
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:10,359
One more thing about Masuk.

260
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:14,439
He only blames himself.

261
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,279
How?

262
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:24,399
Well...

263
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:29,439
When Tir, the ex-boyfriend was gone,

264
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:36,279
they had a date to go see a movie at the mall.

265
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:44,399
And he didn't go on time.

266
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,359
Then...

267
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:52,399
The fire started at the mall.

268
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,279
- Can't enter!
- Can't get in

269
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:25,279
- But my boyfriend hasn't come out yet.
- No, sir. Can't get in.

270
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,279
But my boyfriend hasn't come out yet.

271
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:30,199
Let me go. I'll go help my boyfriend.

272
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:34,199
- Tir.
- No.

273
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:36,279
Can't enter!

274
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:53,399
- Tir. Tir.
- I can't get in, brother.

275
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,319
- Tir...
- Can't get in. Can't.

276
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:54,399
So he always blames himself

277
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:59,319
that he made his boyfriend died.

278
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:05,199
Really, I...

279
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:08,399
I hope Masuk...

280
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:11,399
to meet a good someone.

281
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:17,319
I want him to have some happiness in life.

282
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:33,270
This story is so fucking sad.

283
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,270
Feel bad for Masuk.

284
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,319
So now you know...

285
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:46,239
let's not trigger him.

286
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:53,279
Damn, I was so insensitive.

287
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,239
Me too...

288
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,319
- You!
- Hey!

289
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:12,439
Hey... what?

290
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,319
Don't cry...

291
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:23,359
I really...

292
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:26,279
understand you P'Masuk.

293
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:30,439
I, well...

294
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:35,359
almost lost a loved one too.

295
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:32,319
Food, uncle.

296
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:35,279
Thank you very much.

297
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:47,399
What's wrong! You look uneasy.

298
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:58,239
It's nothing, uncle.

299
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:01,279
There was...

300
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,279
happiness and...

301
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:06,359
some suffering...

302
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:17,279
Missing someone, uncle!

303
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:22,439
Miss them, why don't you go meet them?

304
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:36,359
He's no longer here, uncle.

305
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:42,279
He's been gone for a year now.

306
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:50,199
Gone...

307
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:53,199
without having said goodbye.

308
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:05,319
Do you believe in miracles?

309
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,359
If you do...

310
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:17,399
one day...

311
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:20,399
You will meet the one that you miss.

312
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:42,239
It doesn't really exist, uncle.

313
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:48,279
The miracles...

314
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:06,279
So... I'm going to work, uncle.

315
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:08,319
Umm...

316
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:11,399
Young man...

317
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:16,399
Uncle has something to give you...

318
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:41,279
A consecrated insect wing from my village.

319
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:45,199
They believed that who has possessed it

320
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:47,399
will find good fortune...

321
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:51,199
will only meet good people...

322
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:54,239
Like me...

323
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:56,239
meeting you here.

324
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:00,399
Take it.

325
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:03,399
Take it.

326
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:08,199
You might

327
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:12,199
meet the one that the you miss...

328
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:28,359
Thank you.

329
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:35,439
So... I'll go now.

330
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:40,439
Thank you for the food.

331
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:08,319
Tir...

332
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:10,279
I didn't come alone today.

333
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:15,319
I brought my code brother along.

334
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:17,420
His name is Sat.

335
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:44,199
Tir!

336
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:48,199
I didn't come alone today.

337
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:52,199
I brought my code brother along.

338
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:55,199
His name is Sat.

339
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:00,279
He is very nice.

340
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:05,159
Always stay with me.

341
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:11,279
Tir, don't worry.

342
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:15,159
I'm fine.

343
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:23,199
I brought flowers for you too.

344
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:32,239
The flowers that Tir said it's the rarest.

345
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:52,239
P'Masuk?

346
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:55,359
You always come here like this?

347
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:00,319
Umm...

348
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:06,359
When I have no plan on free time, I come see Tir.

349
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:12,319
I don't want Tir to be lonely.

350
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:18,159
You still love him very much.

351
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:27,279
Umm...

352
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:30,399
Sat, you know?

353
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:39,239
Tir is a good person. He's a very kind.

354
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:43,199
Not just to me

355
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:46,399
but to all the people around him.

356
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:54,359
Tir took care of everyone.

357
00:49:56,360 --> 00:50:00,319
Tir asked why my name was Masuk.

358
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:05,359
I replied to him that...

359
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:08,239
I came on Masuk!

360
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:13,319
I was born on Friday so my parents named me accordingly.

361
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:25,399
Tir took very good care of me.

362
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:30,399
So who approached first?

363
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:37,279
I can't remember who did.

364
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:41,359
It's like...

365
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:45,239
we took care of each other.

366
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:53,399
But I remember the day Tir asked me to be his boyfriend.

367
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:58,199
That day he invited me to go see a movie.

368
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:01,279
The air in the cinema is very cold.

369
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:04,319
And...

370
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:07,359
Tir brought a sweater for me.

371
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:13,239
And he said...

372
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:16,359
there's something in the pocket.

373
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:20,199
When I reached in...

374
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:22,359
I found a card!

375
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:26,159
There was a funny joke written inside, it says

376
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:30,359
If we love someone, invited him to run!

377
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:34,159
Masuk, let's go for a run tomorrow.

378
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:36,399
Really, brother?

379
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:41,239
Well, what did you answer him?

380
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:44,359
I said

381
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:50,599
if you want to ask me to be your boyfriend, there must be flowers too!

382
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:57,999
He then told me to try and reach into the other pocket!

383
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:00,279
When I reached in..

384
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:04,319
it was a blue bougainvillea!

385
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:13,159
I asked P'Tir that..

386
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:19,399
why it had to be the blue bougainvillea?

387
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:28,399
It's rare...

388
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:35,399
Like how we met! It's rare!

389
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:51,279
One more thing.

390
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:55,359
So he wouldn't have a problem with expensive flowers on Valentine's Day.

391
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:01,159
P'Tir was such a visionary.

392
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:03,279
Save budget.

393
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:06,319
Plus it's so romantic!

394
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:15,359
But it'd probably never happened again.

395
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:19,399
A good day like that.

396
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:28,239
Now Tir is waiting for me somewhere.

397
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:38,159
But you said you don't believe in miracles.

398
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:56,359
I still don't believe in them, Sat!

399
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:02,319
If miracles are real,

400
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:07,199
now I'm asking Tir didn't leave.

401
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:11,239
It must be true!

402
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:25,399
I don't want you to be sad like this.

403
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:30,239
Brother Tir!

404
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:34,239
He's gone, bro...

405
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:37,359
You have to move on, brother!

406
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:40,359
I think Tir

407
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:44,399
didn't want me in sorrow like this!

408
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:49,199
He wants you to live. To be happy, bro.

409
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:54,279
I think so, Sat!

410
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:04,199
But I still can't love anyone.

411
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:10,359
I still feel guilty!

412
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:16,279
If that day I got in on time...

413
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:20,359
Tir probably didn't have t®...

414
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:31,199
Bro!

415
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:37,239
If it's time, one must go, brother!

416
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:09,319
Bro...

417
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:16,159
P'Masuk was like that again...

418
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:21,279
I doubt he miss P'Tir.

419
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:26,399
It's my own fault.

420
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:32,359
What should we do?

421
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:38,319
I'll handle it myself, you go to work.

422
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:40,359
Masuk!

423
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:49,199
If the shop is closed,

424
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:56,319
eat with me.

425
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:10,399
- Well, today I...
- And don't reject me!

426
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:18,159
Come with me!

427
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:28,359
Okay.

428
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:49,239
Come...

429
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:27,199
Baby Yu, give me a kiss on the cheek.

430
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:30,199
- Eat more.
- Yes.

431
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:34,239
Hello.

432
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:36,310
- Hello.
- Welcome.

433
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:38,239
Sit down.

434
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:43,359
Everyone, it's Masuk!

435
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:50,199
Masuk that you often told me about?

436
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:53,119
Do you know that he thinks highly of you!

437
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:58,319
Talented, nice, and good-matured. Plus, you never miss a shift!

438
00:59:58,680 --> 01:00:02,319
Don't tell him that.

439
01:00:02,320 --> 01:00:04,359
Now he knows I gossip.

440
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:08,239
It's not gossip. It's an admiration.

441
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:11,399
Masuk, make yourself at home.

442
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:14,399
- Let's eat.
- Let's eat.

443
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:21,319
Eat!

444
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:27,159
Your family is so nice.

445
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:30,199
- They are normal.
- Look at the hungry little boy!

446
01:00:37,320 --> 01:00:39,239
Thank you.

447
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:18,359
- Are you full?
- It's very delicious. So full.

448
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:30,319
- Bro, I'll go now.
- Huh?

449
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:35,239
Baby Yu, Masuk is leaving. Say goodbye.

450
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:37,279
- Good bye.
- Good bye.

451
01:01:37,320 --> 01:01:39,359
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

452
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:45,359
- If you have a chance, come eat with us.
- Thank you.

453
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:48,319
- I'll excuse myself.
- Alright.

454
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:50,359
I'm going to send Masuk off.

455
01:02:05,360 --> 01:02:07,239
Masuk!

456
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:18,959
Bro, I want you to know

457
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:25,279
that you still have me.

458
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:48,399
Is it because of the uncle?

459
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:51,319
Uncle helps me go back and see him again.

460
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:54,220
I came to believe you, uncle!

461
01:02:54,260 --> 01:02:56,180
Tir!

462
01:02:56,240 --> 01:02:58,319
Miracles really do exist.

463
01:03:01,180 --> 01:03:02,300
Masuk...

464
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:07,159
It's been a long time that we haven't meet!
