1
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:02,200
Who is that?

2
00:00:02,271 --> 00:00:04,120
Hey, I'll sit here.

3
00:00:04,625 --> 00:00:06,624
How can you sit with a stranger?

4
00:00:07,146 --> 00:00:08,160
Let's go. You're drunk.

5
00:00:08,187 --> 00:00:11,120
No, I'm not going back.

6
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,120
People in love, they really do this?

7
00:00:24,167 --> 00:00:26,166
Light?

8
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:28,166
Ready-!

9
00:00:29,208 --> 00:00:31,166
Music?

10
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:33,166
Ready!

11
00:00:39,167 --> 00:00:40,207
Crew?

12
00:00:41,167 --> 00:00:43,124
Ready!

13
00:00:46,167 --> 00:00:47,166
Ready!

14
00:00:53,125 --> 00:00:54,082
Go!

15
00:01:00,167 --> 00:01:04,166
Princess, ready.

16
00:01:15,167 --> 00:01:17,207
Right? The princess's ready.

17
00:01:18,167 --> 00:01:21,166
What princess? I'm on Smoke.

18
00:01:22,208 --> 00:01:24,207
Go over there. Smoke's over there.

19
00:01:34,167 --> 00:01:35,249
And where is the director?

20
00:01:37,125 --> 00:01:43,249
Oh, the director is ready.

21
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:53,207
-Hello, Phop.
-Hello.

22
00:01:55,083 --> 00:01:56,082
What do you play, Third?

23
00:01:56,167 --> 00:01:59,124
No. I'm just the first to arrived.

24
00:01:59,167 --> 00:02:03,124
And I had friend set up the scene.

25
00:02:03,167 --> 00:02:04,124
May I take a look?

26
00:02:04,167 --> 00:02:05,207
Sure, Brother Phop.

27
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:10,124
- Get it done today.
- Yes.

28
00:02:11,125 --> 00:02:13,166
Over there, are you shooting nails?

29
00:02:16,167 --> 00:02:18,166
- Almost done.
- No. Right here too, okay?

30
00:02:18,208 --> 00:02:21,166
Okay, sir. There is only one board left.

31
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:24,207
Hurry up. We will start the rehearsal soon.

32
00:02:26,292 --> 00:02:27,166
Oh!

33
00:02:29,125 --> 00:02:30,124
Phop. Hello.

34
00:02:30,167 --> 00:02:31,166
Hello.

35
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:35,124
- What?
- Go to work.

36
00:02:36,208 --> 00:02:37,124
Come here.

37
00:02:38,167 --> 00:02:40,166
Come here, work.

38
00:02:43,167 --> 00:02:44,166
Where did the actor go?

39
00:02:45,167 --> 00:02:46,124
Brother Phop.

40
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:51,166
Team said he'll be here in half an hour.

41
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:54,374
He's late again?

42
00:02:55,292 --> 00:02:57,166
But he's coming. Calm down.

43
00:02:57,167 --> 00:02:59,999
Didn't you tell him? It's bad to be late.

44
00:03:00,167 --> 00:03:01,249
He might have business.

45
00:03:01,292 --> 00:03:03,291
Business? And, I have no business at all?

46
00:03:05,125 --> 00:03:06,166
You call him right now.

47
00:03:06,542 --> 00:03:08,166
Okay, okay, calm down.

48
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:12,124
Okay, I, your sub, will get him for you.

49
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:16,166
If he's famous, I don't bring him in.

50
00:03:16,292 --> 00:03:19,166
Keep calm. I'll get him for you, okay?

51
00:03:19,208 --> 00:03:20,166
Yes!

52
00:03:20,167 --> 00:03:21,166
Okay, I'll call him now.

53
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:22,166
Yep, hurry up.

54
00:03:22,167 --> 00:03:23,166
Yes, sir.

55
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:26,166
Funny, eh?

56
00:03:26,167 --> 00:03:28,166
Work, work it!

57
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:32,082
Hurry up, what does him say?

58
00:03:32,167 --> 00:03:33,082
He's not answering.

59
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:34,499
No answering? Call him until he does.

60
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,207
I have arrived.

61
00:03:49,167 --> 00:03:52,166
Sorry, I just came from another a shooting.

62
00:03:53,167 --> 00:03:56,291
It's fine. We're just getting started.

63
00:03:57,125 --> 00:03:59,249
- Yes.
- Just started as well. Don't worry.

64
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:06,082
You see? Team came late as usual and he's not punished.

65
00:04:07,083 --> 00:04:09,166
And me? One minute late and I was dead.

66
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:10,332
Just go with it..

67
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:17,666
He stands out, famous. Don't compare.

68
00:04:18,167 --> 00:04:22,166
And arrogant too.
All this time with us, he never greeted us.

69
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:24,207
Aren't you do black magic?

70
00:04:25,292 --> 00:04:27,124
Cast a buffalo skin into his stomach, eh?

71
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:31,124
I would.

72
00:04:31,292 --> 00:04:32,166
How many buffalo?
- Ten.

73
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:35,124
- Oh, you want him dead?
- Um.

74
00:04:35,167 --> 00:04:37,124
I'll teach him a lesson.

75
00:04:37,167 --> 00:04:40,207
BTW, the role that I gave you. You practice?

76
00:04:40,292 --> 00:04:41,207
Completed.

77
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:47,166
Well, hello. Hi.
As you know, nothing has changed.

78
00:04:47,167 --> 00:04:48,207
Well, wait for a moment.

79
00:04:49,167 --> 00:04:50,249
Thurs? Mon?
- Yes.

80
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:55,124
- Hurry up.
- Yes.

81
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:58,207
- Thurs, you go to help him with the bag.
- Carrying the bag?

82
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:00,082
Go carry the bag.

83
00:05:00,417 --> 00:05:01,124
Hurry up.

84
00:05:04,167 --> 00:05:05,124
You're slow.

85
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:07,291
Come here.

86
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:12,249
So your role was like yesterday's brief. Nothing's changed.

87
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:14,041
Okay.

88
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:17,166
- So let's start practicing.
- Yes.

89
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:20,830
- Well, it's late. You prepare yourself.
- Yes, sir.

90
00:05:22,167 --> 00:05:25,249
- And you two, in your place.
- Yes, sir.

91
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:27,124
- What are you looking? Hurry up.
- Yes.

92
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:27,999
Hurry up!

93
00:05:28,292 --> 00:05:29,166
-Oh, let's go.
-Go!

94
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:31,249
Do your best. I'll go look around.

95
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,207
So, everyone is ready?

96
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:00,291
Ready? All parties are ready?

97
00:07:01,167 --> 00:07:02,166
Listen up.

98
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:04,082
Five...

99
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:05,249
Four...

100
00:07:06,542 --> 00:07:07,082
Three..

101
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:10,166
Two..

102
00:07:11,167 --> 00:07:11,916
Action!

103
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:17,249
Where is Smoke?

104
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:20,166
Mon,

105
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:23,249
don't you get Smoke out?

106
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:26,166
Yes, sir.

107
00:07:29,167 --> 00:07:30,166
Where's Smoke?

108
00:07:31,167 --> 00:07:32,166
Sorry!

109
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:35,916
Told you that Smoke came out before main actor.

110
00:07:36,167 --> 00:07:39,166
How many times did I tell you? Tell me, how difficult is it?

111
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:43,082
I'll give you one more chance. Go to your station.

112
00:07:43,167 --> 00:07:47,207
Team, give me one more round.

113
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:49,124
Mon, be in place.

114
00:07:57,167 --> 00:07:58,166
I'm sorry.

115
00:07:59,167 --> 00:08:00,207
Your name Mon?

116
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:06,166
Yes, sir.

117
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:09,124
If you hear the signal, let go of the smoke.

118
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:11,082
I will start the dialog.

119
00:08:17,167 --> 00:08:18,166
Okay.

120
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:25,832
Fighting!

121
00:08:54,292 --> 00:08:55,207
Ready?

122
00:08:56,292 --> 00:08:57,291
Five..

123
00:08:58,167 --> 00:08:59,166
Four...

124
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:01,124
Three..

125
00:09:01,167 --> 00:09:02,166
Two..

126
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:03,207
One..

127
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:05,166
Action!

128
00:09:08,292 --> 00:09:11,124
I am Prince of this town, Ali,

129
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:14,291
the most beautiful and is super arrogant.

130
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:22,082
I will never fall in love with a commoner.

131
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:36,249
- Hey, Mon.
- Hmm?

132
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:38,166
Tonight, same place?

133
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:40,207
- The same place?
- Okay.

134
00:10:41,167 --> 00:10:42,207
Do you go often?

135
00:10:42,292 --> 00:10:44,082
Please..

136
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:45,249
Go with me.

137
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:48,166
My treat.

138
00:10:48,292 --> 00:10:49,166
You sure?

139
00:10:49,292 --> 00:10:50,166
I'm sure.

140
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:51,166
Then okay.

141
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,166
Awesome, dude.

142
00:10:54,167 --> 00:10:55,124
But...

143
00:10:55,208 --> 00:10:56,124
What?

144
00:10:56,292 --> 00:10:57,291
Not going back so late, okay?

145
00:10:59,167 --> 00:11:00,124
No later than midnight.

146
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:03,249
- Please?
- Okay.

147
00:11:05,167 --> 00:11:06,166
You so cute!

148
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:09,124
Hurry up!

149
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:10,166
Thurs!

150
00:11:26,167 --> 00:11:27,124
Thurs!

151
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:29,082
Thurs!

152
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:30,082
What's up?

153
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:31,166
Here's not too loud?

154
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:32,374
Will we able talk to each?

155
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:36,082
- You're right.
- Huh?

156
00:11:36,167 --> 00:11:37,166
Proven.

157
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:40,166
Today Puth sings.

158
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:42,166
Cheer him up.

159
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:44,249
Fine, stay here then.

160
00:12:14,167 --> 00:12:17,082
Mon, see that?

161
00:12:18,167 --> 00:12:19,166
They're here too.

162
00:12:20,208 --> 00:12:21,291
So I have no chance today.

163
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:25,166
Cocky as hell.

164
00:12:25,208 --> 00:12:28,124
Well, it's not about us.

165
00:12:30,167 --> 00:12:31,207
Be with your own dude.

166
00:12:32,292 --> 00:12:34,166
I understand.

167
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:41,166
But they took all the attention?

168
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:44,166
So how are we going to get lucky?

169
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:51,291
Wait and see. Team will go back with someone.

170
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:55,082
It's his business.

171
00:12:58,167 --> 00:13:00,291
Didn't you said it's about us?

172
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:02,707
Not about me.

173
00:13:03,167 --> 00:13:04,082
Nah.

174
00:13:04,292 --> 00:13:07,166
Like you never did..

175
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:13,082
Whatever. Will they play yet?

176
00:13:14,167 --> 00:13:16,291
Not yet.

177
00:13:19,167 --> 00:13:20,082
What?

178
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:21,207
Did you say something?

179
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:26,166
I said I haven't.

180
00:13:28,167 --> 00:13:29,124
Haven't what?

181
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:33,166
I haven't did it. I'm a virgin.

182
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:37,124
What? Say it again.

183
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:42,207
I haven't did it yet. Virgin.

184
00:13:46,167 --> 00:13:50,082
Bro, we knew that you're still a virgin.

185
00:13:50,167 --> 00:13:55,124
But you don't have make an announcement.

186
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:56,249
Puth, bro.

187
00:13:58,167 --> 00:14:04,249
Oh, tonight, if anyone can deal him back. Please take good care of my bro.

188
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:08,082
So let's continue with the music.

189
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:35,541
Don't tell me you're interested in that kid.

190
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,166
Thought that I'd help him un-virgin.

191
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:51,166
Aren't you a hunter?

192
00:14:52,292 --> 00:14:56,166
How many points for virgins? Forgot the rules.

193
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:58,082
If he's a virgin, a ten.

194
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:00,166
Celebrity, five.

195
00:15:01,167 --> 00:15:02,582
Other than that, it's just one.

196
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:06,999
But this kid might be hard to get.

197
00:15:07,167 --> 00:15:09,207
Even if you want him, it's not easy.

198
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:22,207
Right, Nuea?

199
00:15:26,167 --> 00:15:27,582
What did you guys talk about now?

200
00:15:28,292 --> 00:15:29,249
I didn't listen at all.

201
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:32,166
What is the matter?

202
00:15:34,292 --> 00:15:37,166
- I'm just in love.
- Hmm?

203
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:39,124
In love.

204
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:42,291
- I'm about to ask him to be my boyfriend.
- Hey!

205
00:15:43,167 --> 00:15:47,082
Don't tell me it's that English major boy

206
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:51,124
That you accidentally kissed. You told me, right?

207
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:56,791
Yes, and now I hired him to tutor

208
00:15:58,167 --> 00:16:00,166
So we have more time to be closer.

209
00:16:01,167 --> 00:16:04,166
What a investment. Tutoring.

210
00:16:04,292 --> 00:16:07,124
So, a bit extra?

211
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,207
I can't complain.

212
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:15,166
Brother Kaeng, Team, I'll leave now.

213
00:16:16,167 --> 00:16:19,249
- Yes, I'll have an appointment with Sun
- Um.

214
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:23,166
See you.

215
00:16:25,167 --> 00:16:27,166
- See you.
- Oh, good luck.

216
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:28,291
- See you.
- See you.

217
00:16:30,167 --> 00:16:31,207
What is that about?

218
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:46,082
So, what to do with that kid?

219
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:47,124
Why?

220
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:48,249
You wanna start?

221
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:54,166
If you don't, I will myself.

222
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:58,166
Don't forget, you're behind ten points.

223
00:17:00,167 --> 00:17:01,166
Shut up about the points.

224
00:17:03,167 --> 00:17:07,166
Give me a week.

225
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:10,166
That kid is mine.

226
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:12,082
Is it too long?

227
00:17:12,167 --> 00:17:13,166
Wait and see.

228
00:17:14,167 --> 00:17:16,166
I'll wait and see.

229
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:42,166
What are you doing, Team?

230
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,166
Can I reserve you?

231
00:18:06,417 --> 00:18:09,416
Thurs, dorm will be closed soon. Let's go.

232
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:12,374
- Huh?
- Dorm will be closed, let's go.

233
00:18:12,417 --> 00:18:16,249
A moment, the music is going crazy.

234
00:18:16,417 --> 00:18:18,457
You play your phone, wait for me.

235
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:26,374
- I'll hit the toilet. When I come back, we go back.
- Um.

236
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:28,166
I don't want to climb anything anymore.

237
00:18:28,292 --> 00:18:29,291
Yes.

238
00:18:29,417 --> 00:18:31,332
Go, take your time.

239
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:54,582
- I'll be in the toilet.
- Okay.

240
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:20,416
Oh, Team.

241
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:36,291
Wash your hands, water for you.

242
00:19:49,417 --> 00:19:50,374
Team...

243
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:54,332
Yes?

244
00:19:59,292 --> 00:20:01,499
How was your day?

245
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:07,374
It was fun.

246
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:11,332
Oh...

247
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,416
Yes?

248
00:20:46,292 --> 00:20:47,332
Soap...

249
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:56,291
Thank you..

250
00:20:58,292 --> 00:21:00,457
And today, is it fun?

251
00:21:05,417 --> 00:21:06,332
Fun.

252
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,291
And where to go next?

253
00:21:10,292 --> 00:21:14,249
Go back or dorm will be closed.

254
00:21:49,417 --> 00:21:51,249
What are you doing?

255
00:21:51,333 --> 00:21:52,374
I'll reserve you.

256
00:21:54,458 --> 00:21:55,582
n case you forgot me.

257
00:22:02,458 --> 00:22:04,291
Well

258
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:07,249
What are you excited about?

259
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:14,291
Thank you very much for today

260
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,374
for the rehearsal.

261
00:22:18,458 --> 00:22:20,374
Otherwise, we'll get scorned.

262
00:22:21,292 --> 00:22:23,249
Anyway, I have to help Mon.

263
00:22:25,458 --> 00:22:29,457
So see ya.

264
00:22:30,375 --> 00:22:31,291
Yes.

265
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,249
Is he okay, Mon?

266
00:23:28,375 --> 00:23:30,499
Since we're back, you can't stop smiling.

267
00:23:31,375 --> 00:23:32,499
What did Thurs take?

268
00:23:33,417 --> 00:23:35,249
Nah...

269
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,416
Puth,

270
00:23:40,292 --> 00:23:45,624
Have you ever felt spelled when you meet the one?

271
00:23:47,292 --> 00:23:49,249
and talked nicely, no curses?

272
00:23:51,458 --> 00:23:56,249
Often, who did you meet?

273
00:23:56,417 --> 00:23:57,499
You can tell me.

274
00:23:58,375 --> 00:24:01,416
I know a lot of people. I can advise you.

275
00:24:02,375 --> 00:24:05,416
It's a senior at the faculty.

276
00:24:07,417 --> 00:24:08,374
Team...

277
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,249
who is also a faculty month.

278
00:24:12,292 --> 00:24:14,291
At first I didn't think anything about him,

279
00:24:14,583 --> 00:24:15,582
'cause I never talked to him.

280
00:24:17,333 --> 00:24:21,291
But when I had, I fell in love.

281
00:24:21,417 --> 00:24:26,374
He both speaks nicely and very friendly.

282
00:24:28,375 --> 00:24:29,332
Mon,

283
00:24:30,375 --> 00:24:36,457
I don't recommend Team.'He's a scorer.

284
00:24:39,375 --> 00:24:43,291
When he got you, it will bailed.

285
00:24:45,458 --> 00:24:48,370
I know. It will never happen.

286
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,374
I just felt it, one way.

287
00:24:51,417 --> 00:24:55,499
- Who he is? Who am I? I know.
- Um.

288
00:24:59,417 --> 00:25:03,374
I warned because I was worried about you.

289
00:25:04,375 --> 00:25:05,416
Thank you.

290
00:25:16,458 --> 00:25:18,332
Wait for me.

291
00:25:24,292 --> 00:25:25,416
Oh, Team?

292
00:25:27,417 --> 00:25:28,457
I would like to go too.

293
00:25:38,458 --> 00:25:41,499
Where you wanna go?

294
00:25:42,417 --> 00:25:44,499
Tenth floor.

295
00:25:46,375 --> 00:25:49,374
Same floor.

296
00:25:54,458 --> 00:25:55,332
Yes, sir

297
00:27:02,292 --> 00:27:05,249
Team, I'm scared.

298
00:27:10,375 --> 00:27:12,457
Don't be afraid.

299
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:23,374
But I can't breathe.

300
00:27:24,417 --> 00:27:27,374
Then

301
00:28:08,375 --> 00:28:10,374
Is it better yet?

302
00:28:14,375 --> 00:28:15,249
Yes, sir.

303
00:28:18,417 --> 00:28:19,499
Can you hear it?

304
00:28:20,417 --> 00:28:21,457
What sound?

305
00:28:22,458 --> 00:28:24,291
The sound of the ventilation fan.

306
00:28:31,417 --> 00:28:33,416
Yes.

307
00:28:38,417 --> 00:28:40,332
Are you okay?

308
00:28:46,375 --> 00:28:47,332
Yes, sir.

309
00:29:20,292 --> 00:29:22,374
Umm, there are people in the elevator.

310
00:29:23,292 --> 00:29:25,291
Wait a moment. How many people inside?

311
00:29:25,375 --> 00:29:28,416
And does anyone have any disease?

312
00:29:30,333 --> 00:29:34,291
There are two people. I don't have any.

313
00:29:36,458 --> 00:29:38,374
And you?

314
00:29:42,292 --> 00:29:44,082
Another person does not have it, too.

315
00:29:44,292 --> 00:29:47,291
Take care of each other. I'll get you out.

316
00:29:47,333 --> 00:29:48,291
Okay.

317
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:54,457
Can you take care of it?

318
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:07,249
So this whole day, Mon's...

319
00:30:09,375 --> 00:30:10,332
can I have it?

320
00:30:15,375 --> 00:30:19,249
Are you going to let me skip school?

321
00:30:58,583 --> 00:31:00,666
Mon, sit here.

322
00:31:12,625 --> 00:31:13,707
Is it delicious?

323
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:20,749
Can I lie down on your lap?

324
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:27,582
Okay.

325
00:31:42,542 --> 00:31:43,541
Mon,

326
00:31:46,542 --> 00:31:48,499
can you scratch my hand?

327
00:31:53,708 --> 00:31:55,582
You think it's a good idea?

328
00:31:56,667 --> 00:31:57,749
Yes...

329
00:32:00,625 --> 00:32:02,499
Okay.

330
00:32:19,667 --> 00:32:20,749
How about this?

331
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:33,582
Team...

332
00:32:35,583 --> 00:32:37,624
Did you skip school often?

333
00:32:38,625 --> 00:32:40,541
Some times

334
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:42,582
when I got bored.

335
00:32:44,708 --> 00:32:48,499
I can't imagine you get bored.

336
00:32:48,583 --> 00:32:49,749
I do,

337
00:32:51,667 --> 00:32:52,749
often, too.

338
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:56,624
Why did you ask me this?

339
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:58,582
Nothing...

340
00:32:59,625 --> 00:33:01,624
It's just...

341
00:33:02,542 --> 00:33:05,582
I saw lots of people like you

342
00:33:06,542 --> 00:33:07,707
so I don't think

343
00:33:08,708 --> 00:33:11,541
that you'll get bored.

344
00:33:11,625 --> 00:33:13,707
People who like me

345
00:33:15,625 --> 00:33:17,582
are not the one I like.

346
00:33:24,708 --> 00:33:29,499
If it's someone I like,

347
00:33:30,625 --> 00:33:32,624
I won't get bored easily.

348
00:33:38,625 --> 00:33:42,624
And... Who do you like?

349
00:33:42,708 --> 00:33:47,749
If I know them, I can connect them for you.

350
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:50,541
The one that I like

351
00:33:50,625 --> 00:33:53,499
might not be that far.

352
00:33:54,708 --> 00:33:57,499
He might be talking to me

353
00:33:58,625 --> 00:34:02,582
and let me lie down on his laps as well.

354
00:34:25,542 --> 00:34:26,624
Team,

355
00:34:27,542 --> 00:34:28,749
looks like it's going to rain.

356
00:34:29,583 --> 00:34:32,666
Shall we... go back to the dormitory?

357
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:34,499
Okay.

358
00:34:43,708 --> 00:34:45,582
So...

359
00:34:46,583 --> 00:34:48,582
Have you ever played in the rain?

360
00:34:51,625 --> 00:34:53,624
I used to when I was young.

361
00:34:54,542 --> 00:34:57,541
How about when you have grown?

362
00:34:59,667 --> 00:35:02,624
So... will you join me in the rain?

363
00:35:09,583 --> 00:35:10,582
But...

364
00:35:11,542 --> 00:35:13,624
I'm afraid of our things getting wet.

365
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:16,749
What are you afraid of?

366
00:35:44,542 --> 00:35:45,707
Come on in.

367
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,624
Close the door for me, will you?

368
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:55,749
Yes, sir.

369
00:36:28,583 --> 00:36:30,624
What are you excited about?

370
00:36:31,583 --> 00:36:32,624
Nothing..

371
00:36:32,667 --> 00:36:35,707
You hit your head a moment ago,

372
00:36:36,708 --> 00:36:38,582
are you hurt?

373
00:36:48,625 --> 00:36:52,499
Then... let me take a look.

374
00:36:54,083 --> 00:36:54,749
Come on.

375
00:36:59,542 --> 00:37:00,582
Where..

376
00:37:04,542 --> 00:37:05,666
Oh, it's a tiny wound.

377
00:37:06,542 --> 00:37:08,749
Abracadabra... Gone!

378
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:25,582
- Go.
- Yes.

379
00:37:33,583 --> 00:37:36,541
Wait for me here.

380
00:37:40,667 --> 00:37:41,749
Sit.

381
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:01,666
- Team
- Huh?

382
00:38:01,667 --> 00:38:03,541
Where are you going?

383
00:39:10,667 --> 00:39:13,541
Here is my clothes.

384
00:39:20,542 --> 00:39:21,749
Twist them that much,

385
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:25,749
you will rip them.

386
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:59,749
- Can I put on my clothes?
- Yes.

387
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:07,707
I think I better go and change at my place.

388
00:42:09,667 --> 00:42:11,666
I just want to say that...

389
00:42:11,667 --> 00:42:14,749
Mon in this clothes looks pretty cute.

390
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:23,666
If it's okay, I'd like to go back.

391
00:42:33,583 --> 00:42:34,624
Mon..

392
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:39,749
Will you have some soup before you go?

393
00:42:42,708 --> 00:42:44,582
Okay then.

394
00:42:44,625 --> 00:42:46,541
Wait for me.

395
00:42:54,542 --> 00:42:55,666
Can you sit?

396
00:43:00,708 --> 00:43:02,541
Yes.

397
00:43:02,625 --> 00:43:04,541
Wait a minute.

398
00:43:41,667 --> 00:43:42,707
Mon,

399
00:43:44,083 --> 00:43:44,707
Yes, sir.

400
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:46,749
Turn off the alarm for me.

401
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:48,707
Okay.

402
00:44:47,583 --> 00:44:48,707
Hot soup is served!

403
00:45:16,708 --> 00:45:18,749
Mon, are you cold?

404
00:45:19,667 --> 00:45:21,541
No.

405
00:45:40,625 --> 00:45:45,749
- This soup, did you make it yourself?
- I just pour in hot water.

406
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:52,541
You're very good.

407
00:46:10,625 --> 00:46:11,749
Is it delicious?

408
00:46:20,625 --> 00:46:21,749
Mon,

409
00:46:28,625 --> 00:46:33,541
you are on my arm, I can't eat.

410
00:47:00,583 --> 00:47:02,499
- Team?
- Yes?

411
00:47:02,542 --> 00:47:08,582
Why are you all the sudden good to me?

412
00:47:09,625 --> 00:47:13,582
You've never before.

413
00:47:13,625 --> 00:47:17,666
Why did you ask me this?

414
00:47:21,667 --> 00:47:22,707
Nothing.

415
00:47:23,667 --> 00:47:25,499
It's just...

416
00:47:26,625 --> 00:47:30,582
we are from different worlds.

417
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:33,749
And it heard a lot of news about you.

418
00:47:36,542 --> 00:47:41,291
So I don't think you want to know people like me.

419
00:47:45,583 --> 00:47:49,707
What other people think, I don't care.

420
00:47:50,583 --> 00:47:54,624
If you don't think like those people, that's enough.

421
00:48:04,583 --> 00:48:06,499
What are you laughing at?

422
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:15,582
Today there is no rehearsal,

423
00:48:16,583 --> 00:48:18,707
I think I should go.

424
00:48:19,583 --> 00:48:21,332
See you tomorrow.

425
00:48:23,542 --> 00:48:24,707
See you, Nong Mon.

426
00:48:41,625 --> 00:48:43,749
Team, you should

427
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:46,707
practice with Mon.

428
00:48:46,750 --> 00:48:51,541
- I have never...
- I'll do it for you.

429
00:49:42,375 --> 00:49:44,082
Are you okay?

430
00:49:44,208 --> 00:49:46,249
Your smile looks higher than an addict.

431
00:49:47,042 --> 00:49:49,207
I fell in love with him.

432
00:49:50,125 --> 00:49:52,082
He is both cute and easy going,.

433
00:49:52,125 --> 00:49:56,166
Not an arrogant like many people say.

434
00:49:57,208 --> 00:49:59,041
And the most important,

435
00:50:00,208 --> 00:50:04,249
he's super caring and took a care of me.

436
00:50:05,083 --> 00:50:06,207
can feel it.

437
00:50:10,167 --> 00:50:11,249
Who?!

438
00:50:13,167 --> 00:50:14,207
Is it Team?

439
00:50:16,125 --> 00:50:17,207
Yes, sir.

440
00:50:19,167 --> 00:50:22,207
I know it's not possible.

441
00:50:25,167 --> 00:50:27,207
But I can't stop thinking about it.

442
00:50:35,208 --> 00:50:36,249
Mon,

443
00:50:39,208 --> 00:50:41,207
let me remind you.

444
00:50:43,167 --> 00:50:45,124
If you don't want to be sad,

445
00:50:46,125 --> 00:50:47,207
don't play with fire.

446
00:50:55,083 --> 00:50:57,041
I know.

447
00:50:58,125 --> 00:51:00,041
There is no way, anyway.

448
00:51:02,125 --> 00:51:06,332
Freshman like you is easy to fool. And you never been in a relationship.

449
00:51:11,125 --> 00:51:13,082
Hey, don't you know?

450
00:51:14,167 --> 00:51:16,124
That Team

451
00:51:18,125 --> 00:51:20,124
is a person with no heart.

452
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:29,166
How?

453
00:51:29,167 --> 00:51:31,166
When I was in first year,

454
00:51:32,250 --> 00:51:35,124
he was super cocky.

455
00:51:35,167 --> 00:51:37,249
Then he got to be the face of the faculty.

456
00:51:39,167 --> 00:51:42,249
At that time, a lot of people want him,

457
00:51:45,167 --> 00:51:48,041
and he got with the senior.

458
00:51:50,208 --> 00:51:53,249
People were envious of him

459
00:51:55,167 --> 00:51:57,124
but it was not for long

460
00:52:00,167 --> 00:52:02,124
the senior

461
00:52:04,042 --> 00:52:06,249
got away with Uni Boy.

462
00:52:09,250 --> 00:52:12,082
He was very sad.

463
00:52:15,458 --> 00:52:17,124
Since then,

464
00:52:22,042 --> 00:52:24,166
he doesn't believe in love again.

465
00:52:27,250 --> 00:52:29,166
That's not all,

466
00:52:30,167 --> 00:52:33,166
he went on to date with his ex's boyfriend.

467
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:35,124
So...

468
00:52:36,208 --> 00:52:40,166
- Got it?
- Huh! Nothing!

469
00:52:42,125 --> 00:52:44,082
When he had him on the hook,

470
00:52:45,167 --> 00:52:47,082
took him to bed

471
00:52:47,208 --> 00:52:49,166
and immediately break up right after.

472
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:51,207
Burr...

473
00:52:55,042 --> 00:52:57,082
Then he started hanging out with

474
00:52:57,250 --> 00:52:59,082
Gaeng,

475
00:52:59,125 --> 00:53:01,082
the hunter.

476
00:53:01,667 --> 00:53:05,207
Until now, zero relationship.

477
00:53:08,083 --> 00:53:09,166
So

478
00:53:10,167 --> 00:53:12,124
can you believe me now?

479
00:53:12,208 --> 00:53:14,249
I know.

480
00:53:16,167 --> 00:53:18,166
Trust me.

481
00:53:19,167 --> 00:53:21,166
It will never happen.

482
00:53:23,208 --> 00:53:26,041
It was just a crush.

483
00:53:30,167 --> 00:53:32,166
Thank you, Puth Bro.

484
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:34,207
Well then..

485
00:53:44,208 --> 00:53:46,249
I'll go eat now.

486
00:54:51,167 --> 00:54:53,124
Right here. Enough!

487
00:54:59,208 --> 00:55:01,207
Okay...

488
00:55:04,042 --> 00:55:05,082
Okay?

489
00:55:05,083 --> 00:55:08,124
- Got it.
- Push it back, push it back a little.

490
00:55:35,083 --> 00:55:37,041
Thank you.

491
00:55:44,250 --> 00:55:46,124
Fighting.

492
00:55:51,042 --> 00:55:52,124
Yes, sir.

493
00:56:08,167 --> 00:56:09,207
What is this?

494
00:56:09,250 --> 00:56:13,082
Since when you are close to Team?

495
00:56:14,125 --> 00:56:15,166
Oh!

496
00:56:16,167 --> 00:56:19,041
Oops! What is this?

497
00:56:19,167 --> 00:56:21,166
Nothing.

498
00:56:23,208 --> 00:56:27,124
I stuck in the elevator with him yesterday.

499
00:56:27,167 --> 00:56:29,166
- Stuck? Elevator?
- Um.

500
00:56:30,042 --> 00:56:33,082
So we talked a little.

501
00:56:33,167 --> 00:56:41,041
- Actually, he's not that bad.
- Um, someone is crazy in love.

502
00:56:46,167 --> 00:56:50,041
- Let's do some work.
- Oh.

503
00:56:53,167 --> 00:56:57,124
You be careful. You will regret it.

504
00:56:57,250 --> 00:56:59,166
Come on. Everyone assemble.

505
00:56:59,167 --> 00:57:03,041
- Hurry up. Hurry up.
- Yes, Phop.

506
00:57:03,083 --> 00:57:05,041
Hurry, hurry, hurry up!

507
00:57:05,083 --> 00:57:08,166
Where did 'the actors go? Oh, they are here.

508
00:57:08,208 --> 00:57:10,249
This morning, we...

509
00:57:10,250 --> 00:57:13,041
Well done, everyone.

510
00:57:13,083 --> 00:57:15,082
Next scene will be the main actress scene,

511
00:57:15,083 --> 00:57:17,166
she will be spelled.

512
00:57:17,167 --> 00:57:19,166
She can't move herself.

513
00:57:19,167 --> 00:57:21,166
Oh, and the actress?

514
00:57:21,167 --> 00:57:25,166
- Where did the actress go?
- What? Did you see?

515
00:57:26,125 --> 00:57:30,124
- I don't see so h'm asking you now.
- Hah aha. Not coming.

516
00:57:31,083 --> 00:57:33,166
- Not coming? Didn't you call her?
- Umm.

517
00:57:33,167 --> 00:57:34,207
Calling now.

518
00:57:34,250 --> 00:57:37,207
- Oh, and now what?
- Huh. Turn off her cell too.

519
00:57:38,208 --> 00:57:41,082
So awesome.

520
00:57:41,208 --> 00:57:45,207
- Yes, go to your station. Like usual.
- Yes, sir.

521
00:57:46,083 --> 00:57:49,082
Team, can I talk to you?

522
00:57:50,083 --> 00:57:51,207
The next scene.

523
00:57:51,208 --> 00:57:53,166
- There will be an actress.
- Yes.

524
00:57:53,167 --> 00:57:56,124
- This scene, she is enchanted, can't move.
- Yes.

525
00:57:56,125 --> 00:57:59,124
Yes, and you have a duty to help her.

526
00:57:59,125 --> 00:58:03,166
We need her here but the point is she is a no show.

527
00:58:03,208 --> 00:58:06,166
I don't know what to do.

528
00:58:12,208 --> 00:58:14,249
I have an idea. Wait here.

529
00:58:15,167 --> 00:58:16,249
Yes!

530
00:58:19,167 --> 00:58:23,166
So, Team you should

531
00:58:23,167 --> 00:58:27,166
practice with Mon.

532
00:58:27,167 --> 00:58:31,166
So he won't get stage shy to be there alone.

533
00:58:31,208 --> 00:58:34,082
You just read the script. Okay?

534
00:58:34,125 --> 00:58:36,124
It's nothing, just stand still.

535
00:58:36,167 --> 00:58:37,249
Did you read the script?

536
00:58:37,250 --> 00:58:40,207
- I did.
- Yes. So like the script.

537
00:58:41,042 --> 00:58:45,166
Okay, let's role. No stage shy.

538
00:59:02,167 --> 00:59:04,249
Mon, relax.

539
00:59:06,167 --> 00:59:08,166
Just stand still.

540
00:59:09,083 --> 00:59:11,166
I have never....

541
00:59:11,208 --> 00:59:13,207
I'll do it for you.

542
00:59:14,042 --> 00:59:15,082
Don't worry..

543
00:59:50,167 --> 00:59:52,124
My dear...

544
00:59:52,333 --> 00:59:54,124
I'm sorry

545
00:59:54,167 --> 00:59:57,166
that I couldn't make you be the same.

546
00:59:58,042 --> 01:00:01,166
But I promise that I will love

547
01:00:02,083 --> 01:00:04,249
and be loyal to you forever.

548
01:01:01,875 --> 01:01:03,207
You never kiss?

549
01:01:13,125 --> 01:01:16,166
- I'm sorry.
- So why did you hug and kiss him?
