00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:42,520

22
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:48,530

23
00:01:49,371 --> 00:01:52,120

24
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:29,460
Just now you stood a chance to not be defeated.

25
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:36,800
So now

26
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:41,840
it's your turn.

27
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,920
Master.

28
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:25,000
I've finally found my Cosmic Path.

29
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:38,300
Ye Yun, stop right there!

30
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,340
This isn't over yet.

31
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:50,100
My Cosmic Path.

32
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:53,420
I've found it.

33
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:06,440
I want justice in the world to stand unyielding!

34
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:09,460
I seek to cleanse the world's impurities!

35
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:12,780
If I encounter an obstacle on my path, I shall overcome it and create a new path!

36
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,340
That is my Cosmic Path!

37
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:18,560
I'd like to see which of you dares stop me!

38
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:26,420
Fine, then.

39
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:17,680
With his legs as the sword hilt, his body as the sword blade,

40
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,900
his fists as the sword pommel, and his fingers as the sword tip?

41
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:24,060
Is he... now one with the sword?

42
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:47,780
Forget it.

43
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:56,090

44
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:16,220
Jinxuan, how did it go?

45
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:21,040
Your Majesty, I didn't see the last blow clearly either.

46
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:25,760
But judging from the situation, Baili Dongjun won by a tiny margin.

47
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,720
Brother Yun.

48
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:08,320
Baili Dongjun, why are you doing this?

49
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,980
Guards! Capture Ye Dingzhi!

50
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:14,820
Yes, Your Majesty!

51
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,640
Your Majesty!

52
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43,800
It's here.

53
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,320
Has an urgent report arrived?

54
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,700
Senior won the battle.

55
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,800
Isn't that great?

56
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,720
Why do you look upset?

57
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:03,500
It's great that he won. But he... took Ye Dingzhi away.

58
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,420
I saw that coming from a mile away.

59
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:10,040
If I were in his shoes...

60
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:14,140
Forget it. Even if I were in his shoes I couldn't defeat Ye Dingzhi.

61
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:17,540
Why did Senior take Ye Dingzhi away?

62
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,400
Because he thinks that he still has a chance to turn over a new leaf.

63
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:24,480
But so many people died because of Ye Dingzhi.

64
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,900
Maybe he didn't kill them. But they all died because of him.

65
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:32,760
All I can say is the root of the issue lies deeper, not with Ye Dingzhi.

66
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,380
What about the soldiers who died defending our southern and northern borders?

67
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:37,820
What about the martial artists who died fending off the demonic sect?

68
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:39,730
These feuds have nothing to do with them.

69
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:42,180
So, why are they dead?

70
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:48,700
Everyone has to pay a price for their actions.

71
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,520
It's the same for Ye Dingzhi.

72
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,520
Well said.

73
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,960
Those are excellent words indeed.

74
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,820
Miss Li...

75
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:07,500
Young Master Li, you delivered a great speech just now.

76
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,540
You sounded just like Dark River.

77
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,280
Why don't you change your surname?

78
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,660
Call yourself Su Hanyi.

79
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,260
The Su Family welcomes you.

80
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:17,860
Who would want to be an assassin in your sect?

81
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:20,380
What's so bad about being an assassin?

82
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:22,300
Am I right, Muyu?

83
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,860
You won't be able to kill Ye Dingzhi alone.

84
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:38,120
I'll join you.

85
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:41,380
According to the letter, two of Tianqi's Four Guardians,

86
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:44,660
Li Xinyue and Ji Ruofeng together only lasted 30 minutes.

87
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:48,120
You two? You two think you can defeat him?

88
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,460
What if you include us?

89
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,280
Wang Rensun of the Heavenly Mountain Sect?

90
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,280
Ye Xiaofan, the Nameless Sword?

91
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,280
Song Yanhui of Wushuang City?

92
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:12,460
And Wang Yixing of Mount Wangcheng?

93
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:18,400
Wait. I can understand why they're here. But Wang Yixing, what are you doing here?

94
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:22,640
Do you think I want to be here? My master ordered me so I had to come.

95
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,720
Go ahead.

96
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,120
Take care.

97
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:54,700
A long time ago, when he was still living outside Gusu City,

98
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:57,940
I encountered him. I was still young back then.

99
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:00,140
I snuck out of Xueyue City and traveled around.

100
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:03,140
He taught me several sword techniques.

101
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:06,060
When I asked him who he was,

102
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,300
he only said he was a wandering martial artist from Jiangnan.

103
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,680
Back then, I admired him.

104
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:17,600
Just like Ye Xiaofan in the past.

105
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:25,820
But in certain things, what's wrong is wrong.

106
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:28,080
There's no turning back.

107
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,480
What should we do next?

108
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,100
Luo Qingyang and I made a deal.

109
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:10,260
After leaving Tianqi City we'd split up and head south.

110
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:12,320
And meet up at Gusu City.

111
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,440
After that, Brother Yun can lead a reclusive life with Wenjun.

112
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,480
As for us, we'll think of something else.

113
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,700
Right now wars are everywhere.

114
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:22,820
The northern tribes and Nanjue are taking advantage of the demonic sect.

115
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:24,520
As long as...

116
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,400
As long as Brother Yun doesn't appear...

117
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,940
Is it truly that simple?

118
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:51,620
Both the northern tribes and Nanjue have their own motives.

119
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:57,120
Ye Dingzhi only provided them with an opportunity.

120
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,320
Right now Beili's foes are closing in from three directions.

121
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:05,280
At this time they won't withdraw their troops so easily.

122
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:10,700
You were the hero of Beili when you narrowly won against him.

123
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:14,120
But from the moment you escaped with him on your back,

124
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:18,420
all of Beili's swords became pointed at you.

125
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:24,940
I'll never give up until the very last moment.

126
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:29,900
I'm sure there's a solution to this.

127
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:09,480

128
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:12,709

129
00:15:12,709 --> 00:15:14,740
How did it go?

130
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,480
The Chief...

131
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:23,280
- lost. 
 - He lost?

132
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:26,100
To whom?

133
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,160
Baili Dongjun.

134
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,900
- And then? 
 - Our scout said

135
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:37,140
that Baili Dongjun escaped southward with the Chief.

136
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:40,620
However, he didn't know where they were heading.

137
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,660
Southward?

138
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,500
Could it be Nanjue?

139
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,160
It's not Nanjue.

140
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,900
Father will definitely head to Gusu City.

141
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,700
Actually, Father doesn't want to be the Chief.

142
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:03,940
He only wants to return to that grass hut.

143
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:09,620
Child, what you said is so profound.

144
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,800
You're still a child.

145
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:17,120
Leave all this to us adults.

146
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:41,640
I burned some sleeping grass.

147
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,180
He overexerted himself.

148
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:45,120
However, he does possess great internal strength.

149
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,460
We should lower our voices.

150
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:10,260
Young Master Ye, what do you want to tell me?

151
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:12,920
I assume you know.

152
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:16,400
I've heard of many instances of descent into demonic ways.

153
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,760
But I've never seen one like yours.

154
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:21,880
You're clear-headed. You still have a conscience as well.

155
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:24,220
What kind of descent into the demonic ways is this?

156
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:29,110
Shouldn't they all be... irrational

157
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:31,660
and filled with bloodlust?

158
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:34,780
Only a thin line lies between demon and deity.

159
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:40,400
Before this, I didn't care about the people of the world.

160
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:44,080
I wanted to kill everyone who saw me as their enemy.

161
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:48,220
To those who uphold righteousness, I'm a demon.

162
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:54,080
Dongjun...

163
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:57,700
He wishes to save the world.

164
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,700
He wishes to save me as well.

165
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:05,260
That's not the path of righteousness or demonic ways.

166
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:09,680
- What is it then? 
 - It's his own path.

167
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,470
But no matter how broad his path is,

168
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:18,100
I can't travel on the same path with him.

169
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:23,100
I'm leaving.

170
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,480
You need not waste your energy in stopping me.

171
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,200
I don't wish to hurt you either.

172
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,720
- But your wound is... 
 - It's fine.

173
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,720
Dongjun didn't target my vital points.

174
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:37,880
Moreover, you should be aware of the regenerative abilities of the Xunian Technique.

175
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,240
All right.

176
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:45,040
Once he's awake, travel west with him.

177
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:48,660
The faster, the further, the better.

178
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:54,360
Don't try to make any contact with me again.

179
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:58,120
I'll end all this in my own way.

180
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,960
 It smells great.

181
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:11,780
 Here.

182
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:13,700
 Here, try this.

183
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,900
 Delicious.

184
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:31,020
It's not raining. Why are you holding an umbrella?

185
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:33,800
It's an umbrella as well as a weapon.

186
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:36,540
It's the legendary Eighteen-Sword Formation, right?

187
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:38,840
I do wish to witness it myself.

188
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:42,600
It's a shame that I'll be witnessing it as your enemy.

189
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,820
What are you laughing at?

190
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:53,740
Because it's hilarious.

191
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:57,760
I've never heard of anyone trying to spar with the Dark River Umbrella Ghost before.

192
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:01,090
Do you have any idea how terrifying it is?

193
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:06,340
I wish to spar with any powerful swordsman in the world.

194
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:09,260
You do have a point. Miss Li...

195
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:13,740
I mean, Young Master Li, you'll naturally become a Sword Deity in the future.

196
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:17,580
You did draw your sword against Mount Wangcheng twice before.

197
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:21,220
Does this peach look familiar to you? Yuzhen planted it.

198
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:26,740
I spoke too much.

199
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:31,580
Oh, right. I wanted to ask you this just now, Mister.

200
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:34,000
This isn't the season for peaches yet.

201
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,260
Indeed. Our Yuzhen set up a formation on Mount Wangcheng.

202
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:40,420
Because of that, we can enjoy peaches all year long.

203
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:43,820
It's a huge mountain, yet he can set up a formation there without any trouble?

204
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:48,300
Seems like this junior of yours is extraordinary.

205
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:54,920
Young Master Li. Here, catch.

206
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:01,320
You should eat while you can.

207
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:05,200
It's possible this might be the last peach you ever eat.

208
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:57,120
My old friends are here, huh?

209
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:05,200
It's been awhile.

210
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:15,980
It's been a long time since we met after parting ways at the Academy.

211
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:18,800
However, I won't regret my decision.

212
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,920
Brother Ye.

213
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:40,740
During Spring Festival Eve, I was there.

214
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:43,400
Initially, I wanted to visit you.

215
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:46,920
But I didn't.

216
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:57,100
You said we would meet again one day.

217
00:23:57,100 --> 00:24:01,120
Now that we've met again, I'm pleased.

218
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:08,940
When I saw you back then you were dashing and brimming with energy.

219
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:12,240
I wanted to challenge you to a duel, hoping to win by a single move.

220
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:17,280
I never expected to come here with all these people to try and kill you now.

221
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:32,600
Life is truly unpredictable in so many ways.

222
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:44,820
Dark River's assassins, huh?

223
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:47,560
I've heard of you guys before.

224
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:52,520
I heard that you intend to kill when you start spinning your umbrella.

225
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,540
Wuchan.

226
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:19,040
Master, Brother Ye is in trouble! I'll go and...

227
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:24,340
Wuchan, there's a consequence for every action.

228
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:27,560
This is the karma he has to bear.

229
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:32,980
You're truly the hardest assassination target I've ever encountered.

230
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:41,220
Ye Dingzhi! It's not too late for you to escape!

231
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,300
Watch out!

232
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:34,420
Muyu. I finally understand now.

233
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:36,880
The seven of us aren't enough.

234
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,720
Just you, me, and the unyielding Li Hanyi are trying to kill him, huh?

235
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:43,580
What has Dark River done to deserve this?

236
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:47,040
- He hasn't recovered from his injury yet. 
 - It isn't time yet.

237
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:52,140
Then I'll leave the last blow to you.

238
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,820
What's the name of this technique?

239
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:35,590
It's called Muyu.

240
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:39,220
It does resemble a beautiful rain of swords.

241
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:54,060
The Mystic Wind Sword my master left me was just like this one.

242
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:58,420
It's a shame that I don't have it here with me now.

243
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,780
Lend me your sword.

244
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:12,600
Yao'er, you should've stopped Brother Yun.

245
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:15,300
He was bent on not dragging you into this. He insisted on parting ways with you.

246
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:17,000
You wouldn't have been able to stop him even if you were awake.

247
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:21,400
There's no need to waste your energy and let the pursuers take advantage of the situation.

248
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:26,400
Dongjun, if there's one person in the world who can change his mind,

249
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:29,000
it can only be Yi Wenjun.

250
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:45,200
Ji Ruofeng. What are you doing here instead of recuperating?

251
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:50,600
On my way here, I've witnessed the annihilation of many sects.

252
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:54,100
Many innocent people were killed.

253
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:57,600
They were committed by the demonic sect members who infiltrated Beili.

254
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:02,500
Although it might not have been Ye Dingzhi's order, in the end, it's still related to him.

255
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:06,300
If you save him that means you're going against the Martial World of Beili.

256
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:10,300
However, you represent the Academy, Xueyue City, and Beili's path of righteousness.

257
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:16,200
Although the old man didn't give me any instructions, I have to stop you here.

258
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,700
Try me, then.

259
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:20,900
You think you're saving him.

260
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:24,100
You have no idea that you're killing him by doing so.

261
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:25,400
What do you mean?

262
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:29,900
Although Ye Dingzhi has entered the Malevolence Phase, he still has feelings for those around him.

263
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:31,800
You're his best friend.

264
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:34,100
Due to that, he'll never accept your grace.

265
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:37,300
It's because he's the vilest person in the world right now.

266
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:42,300
And if you save him, you'll be pushing yourself into the abyss and the point of no return.

267
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:44,500
Therefore, he'll never let you save him.

268
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:48,300
If you wish to bring him to Nanjue, he'll stay in Beili.

269
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:51,700
Can you understand me if I put it that way?

270
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:57,500
So, in your opinion, what should I do?

271
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:00,500
Let Ye Dingzhi engage them in battle and escape by himself.

272
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:04,900
If he wins against the martial world of Beili and manages to escape to Nanjue, that means he's lucky.

273
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:09,200
If he loses and dies, that's his fate.

274
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,700
It has nothing to do with you, Baili Dongjun.

275
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,200
You've done enough for him.

276
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,100
You've committed plenty of mistakes as well.

277
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:18,100
Although the world has let Ye Dingzhi down,

278
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:22,200
Ye Dingzhi has exacted his revenge against the world, too.

279
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:24,640
It's too late for him to turn back.

280
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,000
Now he has no choice but to be a demon.

281
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
As for you, if you insist on taking this path,

282
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:35,200
you'll cease to be Baili Dongjun of the Academy and Xueyue City.

283
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:40,800
Gu Chen, Li Changsheng, and Nangong Chunshui all advised you to act according to your will in life.

284
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,500
You may do so but that doesn't mean you should act recklessly.

285
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,400
You should stop here.

286
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,600
Otherwise, this time, I won't reserve my strength.

287
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:52,340
I'll fight you to the death.

288
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:58,900
Miss Yue Yao, what do you think about my speech?

289
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:03,700
In my opinion, of course I wish for Dongjun to be safe.

290
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:08,900
I hope he can return to Xueyue City in a carefree manner.

291
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:14,100
But now I've decided to follow Dongjun's will.

292
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:20,500
If Dongjun wants to leave, I'll leave with him.

293
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:23,800
If he wishes to fight, I'll fight alongside him.

294
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:29,600
Chief, if you wish to fight us to the death, you will die as we outnumber you two to one.

295
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:40,100
Miss Yue Yao, you're impressive indeed.

296
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:42,200
There are plenty of things I can accept.

297
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,200
But I can never accept Brother Yun being killed.

298
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,000
Never.

299
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,800
As long as I can protect him for now, I can negotiate a deal with the emperor

300
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:53,500
and the major sects of Beili after this.

301
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:56,240
You make it sound too easy.

302
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:00,880
Someone's here.

303
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:33,200
Chief Ye, you're powerful indeed.

304
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:36,500
You thought you utilized the best chance you had.

305
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:42,200
But facing me, you stand no chance at all.

306
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,700
No.

307
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:48,700
I know that the chance hasn't appeared yet.

308
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,860
That's the chance we've been waiting for.

309
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:29,500
It's as if you all practiced countless times before you could execute such a joint attack.

310
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:33,900
But it also contained the resolve that came from exhausting all efforts for the first time.

311
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:37,500
Maybe this is the chemistry between swordsmen.

312
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:48,200
I once thought of becoming such a swordsman as well.

313
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:53,960
Wang Wang, I'm sorry.

314
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,920
I broke your blade.

315
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:02,700
I said it before. You all...

316
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:09,040
I hid some sword qi within my sword of blood.

317
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:15,500
It'll rupture your internal organs if you don't come up with a solution soon.

318
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:26,100
He's regulating his qi to force out that sword qi of yours.

319
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:29,200
We just need someone...

320
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:33,440
to go and chop off his head.

321
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,700
There's no way around it.

322
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:44,500
None of us reserved our strength due to that joint attack.

323
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:46,400
That's how it is for opportunities.

324
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,400
You only get them once.

325
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:53,400
No. One of us hasn't acted yet.

326
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:47,661

327
00:36:47,661 --> 00:36:50,080

328
00:36:51,900 --> 00:37:02,000

329
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:13,000
♫  A gentle breeze intentionally stirs the heart  ♫

330
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:20,800
♫  Moored by the lake, ripples spread, feet covered with spring mud  ♫

331
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:30,350
♫  The branches softly whisper secrets in the wind  ♫

332
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:38,700
♫  In the moonlit night, I trace the outlines of your unfinished story  ♫

333
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:41,700
♫  As if destined by fate, I gaze upon your quietly graceful figure  ♫

334
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:44,100
♫  Restlessly searching for you  ♫

335
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:48,500
♫  I'll follow you until sunset and late afternoon sunshine  ♫

336
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:53,000
♫  Listening intently to the soft drizzle, accompanied by a lone shadow  ♫

337
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,400
♫  Who am I with at this moment?  ♫

338
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,500
♫  Roaming the world together in harmony  ♫

339
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:02,000
♫  Two hearts cherishing each other  ♫

340
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:06,400
♫  A red letter becomes a boat navigating our love  ♫

341
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:10,800
♫  A folding fan sways among the stars and clouds  ♫

342
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:14,200
♫  In this perfect moment  ♫

343
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:19,100
♫  I met you  ♫

344
00:38:55,200 --> 00:39:04,000
♫  A gentle breeze intentionally stirs the heart  ♫

345
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:12,000
♫  Moored by the lake, ripples spread, feet covered with spring mud  ♫

346
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:21,450
♫  The branches softly whisper secrets in the wind  ♫

347
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:29,600
♫  In the moonlit night, I trace the outlines of your unfinished story  ♫

348
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:32,800
♫  As if destined by fate, I gaze upon your quietly graceful figure  ♫

349
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:35,300
♫  Restlessly searching for you  ♫

350
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:39,600
♫  I'll follow you until sunset and late afternoon sunshine  ♫

351
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:44,100
♫  Listening intently to the soft drizzle, accompanied by a lone shadow  ♫

352
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:47,500
♫  Who am I with at this moment?  ♫

353
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:50,600
♫  Roaming the world together in harmony  ♫

354
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:53,100
♫  Two hearts cherishing each other  ♫

355
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:57,500
♫  A red letter becomes a boat navigating our love  ♫

356
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:01,900
♫  A folding fan sways among the stars and clouds  ♫

357
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:05,200
♫  In this perfect moment  ♫

358
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:10,200
♫  I met you  ♫
