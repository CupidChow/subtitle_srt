00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:55,020
Not bad, you still remember me.

191
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,420
When did you arrive?

192
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:57,460
Why didn't you come to visit me?

193
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:58,580
I just got here today

194
00:08:58,780 --> 00:08:59,740
and I was about to visit you.

195
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:02,420
Long time no see, Sikong Changfeng.

196
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,140
Mr. Zhuomo.

197
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:07,260
Anyway,

198
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:09,380
you got into a fight
as soon as you arrived here

199
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:10,780
and you got hit hard?

200
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,380
Don't even mention it.

201
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:13,340
I thought

202
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:14,420
I should prepare a gift

203
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:15,460
to celebrate our reunion.

204
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:16,540
Normal liquor

205
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:17,460
pales in comparison to yours.

206
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:18,780
But they've sold out their best liquor,

207
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:19,820
so I had to fight for it.

208
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:21,220
But in the end,

209
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:21,820
I lost the fight,

210
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:22,780
the liquor,

211
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,100
and even my spear.

212
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:26,780
You couldn't defeat him?

213
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:29,540
What about the two of us?

214
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:36,700
Master Xie, your Jingang Force Field

215
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:37,740
has improved a lot.

216
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:39,900
Unfortunately,

217
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:43,100
that young man managed to break it.

218
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:47,540
He's got potential.

219
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:49,180
Indeed,

220
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,060
he's like an eagle.

221
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:56,220
Look.

222
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:58,460
This way, please.

223
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:06,860
You've already got some helpers?

224
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:09,700
Is that jar over there

225
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:10,820
the Qiulubai?

226
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:11,860
Yes,

227
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:13,780
it's a 12-year-old

228
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:14,300
Qiulubai.

229
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:15,860
I want it.

230
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:27,660
That's a strong palm move.

231
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:29,860
I see, I'm not the only brewer

232
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:31,500
who knows martial arts.

233
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:33,500
Dongjun, don't be rude.

234
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:34,780
This is

235
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:36,380
the top-ranked brewmaster
in Diaolou Tavern.

236
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:38,020
Everyone in Tianqi

237
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:39,100
addresses him

238
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:39,980
as Master Xie.

239
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:42,060
Mr. Zhuomo.

240
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:43,260
Master Xie, sorry for offending you.

241
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:44,540
This is

242
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:45,780
my new junior.

243
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:48,300
I apologize for his rude behavior.

244
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:50,940
This is Mr. Li's new disciple?

245
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:51,860
No wonder.

246
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:53,940
Did you fight me

247
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:55,780
for the liquor?

248
00:10:58,460 --> 00:10:59,660
That's my friend's spear.

249
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,100
Your friend failed the challenge.

250
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:06,460
He has to leave something behind.

251
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:08,020
That's the rule.

252
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,060
But if I win,

253
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:10,660
can I take both the spear

254
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:11,340
and the liquor?

255
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:12,620
Of course.

256
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:14,380
Come on!

257
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:16,820
A fighting challenge for a jar of liquor

258
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:18,060
seems pretty weird.

259
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:19,420
How about I challenge you
to something else?

260
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:23,700
What do you have in mind?

261
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:25,740
Let's see who can

262
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:26,940
make the best liquor.

263
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:28,740
What?

264
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:29,980
This guy is crazy!

265
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:31,620
He's challenging Master Xie
to a brewing showdown?

266
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:32,820
He's too full of himself.

267
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,020
Let's meet again
on the 14th day of the month.

268
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:37,260
By then, I will bring my own liquor

269
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:38,020
to Diaolou Tavern.

270
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:39,260
Prepare the best liquor you have

271
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,500
in Diaolou Tavern

272
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:41,620
and the best liquor taster

273
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:42,780
in the city.

274
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:45,100
Then, I'll be taking that spear

275
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:46,380
and the jar of liquor.

276
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:47,980
You insolent boy.

277
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:49,860
Do you know what you're saying?

278
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:51,260
Even if you are

279
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:52,460
Mr. Li's last disciple,

280
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:54,380
you should keep your ego in check.

281
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:58,580
Master Xie,

282
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:00,700
my junior has been mastering

283
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:03,220
the art of making liquor
for over a decade.

284
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,540
And I have been making liquor
for over 40 years.

285
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:05,620
Fine.

286
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:10,100
A good jar of liquor
can tell hundreds of stories.

287
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:11,820
The passion of youth,
the composure of a middle-aged man,

288
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,140
and the richness that comes with age,
they're all different.

289
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:14,620
Having more years
of experience under your belt

290
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:16,140
doesn't mean you can defeat me.

291
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:26,660
I'll be waiting, then.

292
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:33,700
What brings you here?

293
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:34,620
I was

294
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,220
planning to take my junior

295
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:37,900
to somewhere fun,

296
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:38,420
but when

297
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:39,580
we passed by Diaolou Tavern,

298
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:40,900
we heard a commotion.

299
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:41,620
So

300
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:43,100
we decided to check it out.

301
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,180
Well, it's just me

302
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:44,940
who wanted to check it out.

303
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:45,780
And it just so happened

304
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:47,180
that you were kicked out.

305
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:48,780
I was still wondering

306
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:49,460
how I should respond

307
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:50,020
when he

308
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:50,420
recognized you

309
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:51,460
from afar.

310
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:51,900
He

311
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,100
flew towards you

312
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:54,780
and saved you from falling.

313
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:58,260
So you've really
become Mr. Li's disciple?

314
00:12:58,540 --> 00:12:59,420
That means you're Mr. Zhuomo,

315
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:00,140
I mean,

316
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:01,180
your second senior's junior.

317
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:01,900
How nice.

318
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:03,420
You're doing great yourself.

319
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:04,380
You got here alive

320
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:05,780
to meet me.

321
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:08,820
Second Senior,

322
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:10,220
where are you going exactly?

323
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:15,380
Well, we're here.

324
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:20,600
[Baihua Hall]

325
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:45,540
Come in.

326
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:46,420
Let's get you a private room.

327
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:47,340
Nice.

328
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:48,660
I'll leave you a good tip.

329
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:50,380
Sir.

330
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:51,180
You're here.

331
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:52,100
Come on.

332
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:02,540
Wait... Is this a brothel?

333
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,220
Not at all.

334
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,580
This is Baihua Hall.

335
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:07,740
It's different.

336
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,140
How is it different?

337
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:11,820
Because of her.

338
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:13,780
She makes this place different.

339
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:17,020
Years ago, Gu Jianmen and I

340
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:18,740
came here for the first time.

341
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,340
She was playing the guqin.

342
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,660
Gu Jianmen probably was drunk

343
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,780
and when he heard her playing,

344
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:26,060
he got into the mood

345
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:28,740
and danced with his sword.

346
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:38,620
It was a magnificent scene to behold.

347
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:47,900
So handsome.

348
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:49,540
His sword

349
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:51,060
gathered a flurry of petals

350
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:53,140
in a sparkling array of colors.

351
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:29,700
The petals eventually formed

352
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,740
into a flowery bridge

353
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:32,820
that led to

354
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:35,300
her pavilion up there.

355
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:42,220
Gu Jianmen said

356
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:44,460
that her music speaks
volumes about herself.

357
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:45,980
He felt that the lady

358
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,340
was his destined lover.

359
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,700
So he stepped onto the petal bridge

360
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:52,580
and walked towards the pavilion,

361
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:56,460
then lifted one veil
after another to see her.

362
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:57,980
Be careful, sir!

363
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:31,980
And then?

364
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:35,540
And then, Gu Jianmen came down.

365
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:36,940
He got rejected.

366
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:41,740
That was

367
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:43,140
quite some years ago.

368
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,420
I'm sure the young lady

369
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,580
has blossomed

370
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:46,780
into a fine and mature woman.

371
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:48,540
Everyone in Tianqi

372
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:49,540
knows her name.

373
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:51,620
I wonder if Gu Jianmen

374
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:53,420
would still sigh when he sees her.

375
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:57,900
Mr. Lei, it's been so long
since you last came.

376
00:16:58,900 --> 00:16:59,700
Not as long

377
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:00,740
as Gu did.

378
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,100
How long exactly do you mean?

379
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:06,380
Not that long ago, actually.

380
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:17,100
I can feel a murderous aura.

381
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:26,620
Miss... Miss Li.

382
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:29,020
Picking up such bad habits
at such a young age.

383
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:29,500
I...

384
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:31,060
I'm innocent.

385
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:34,420
Xinyue.

386
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:36,780
Yes.

387
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:38,380
Baili Dongjun,

388
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:40,060
you're picking up such bad habits
at your age.

389
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:41,500
I told you not to come here,

390
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,220
but you insisted.

391
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:43,420
I said I didn't want to come,

392
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:44,220
but you still

393
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:45,820
dragged me in here anyway.

394
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:46,300
Well?

395
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:47,140
Are you satisfied?

396
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:48,020
Happy now?

397
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:49,700
This isn't the place

398
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:51,140
for me to come.

399
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:54,420
Do you have no shame?

400
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:54,900
Shut up.

401
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:57,860
Xinyue.

402
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,020
Let's go home,

403
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:01,980
back to our cozy little home.

404
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:03,220
When do you plan

405
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:04,660
to come here again?

406
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:05,220
Not anymore.

407
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:06,740
I'll never come here again.

408
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:08,260
Even if my junior invites me,

409
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:09,220
I'd never come again.

410
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:11,580
Come on.

411
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:14,700
Dongjun,

412
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:16,740
have fun while you're young.

413
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:17,580
Your good days

414
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:19,260
are numbered.

415
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:20,140
Dongjun.

416
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:20,500
Come on.

417
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:20,940
Dongjun.

418
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:23,100
Come on.

419
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:24,780
Xinyue!

420
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,020
I was wrong!

421
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:31,260
Where are we?

422
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:33,540
What should we do?

423
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:37,180
Gentlemen.

424
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:39,020
What... What is it?

425
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:42,260
What handsome young men we have here.

426
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,260
Madam Ziyi.

427
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:45,180
Is Miss Feng

428
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:46,420
still playing tonight?

429
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,380
I'm getting impatient.

430
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:50,500
Don't be.

431
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:55,780
She's here.

432
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:58,980
Alright.

433
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:02,900
Second Master Tu.

434
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,780
You're here just in time.

435
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:06,860
This melody

436
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:09,860
has a melancholy vibe to it.

437
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:14,500
I've heard this before.

438
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:15,860
Have you been here?

439
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:17,300
No.

440
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,780
Do you know music?

441
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:20,260
No.

442
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:21,980
I've heard this score before.

443
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:23,460
It's called The Jiangnan Moon.

444
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:26,780
"All is home
as the midnight gong chimes,

445
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:28,580
only the rustling of leaves
is heard at such times.

446
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:30,740
A white glow illuminates
the autumn night,

447
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:33,460
in my hometown the moon shines bright."

448
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,100
This score is about one's
longing for home.

449
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:10,740
Sir.

450
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:12,340
Miss.

451
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:15,020
That's not a title I deserve to hold.

452
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:16,260
Our young lady would like to meet you.

453
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:20,100
Your young lady is?

454
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:21,780
Young man,

455
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,500
are you really that ignorant?

456
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:24,500
There's only

457
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,060
one young lady

458
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:27,100
in Baihua Hall.

459
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,220
Wait, wait.

460
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:30,490
Who is

461
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,100
this dumb kid?

462
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,180
Why is Miss Feng inviting only him?

463
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,500
I come here every day

464
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:36,540
and I've spent quite a lot...

465
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:37,060
Second Master Tu.

466
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:38,260
I still haven't met Miss Feng in person.

467
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,340
How come he gets to meet her

468
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,660
on his first visit?

469
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:42,100
Second Master Tu,

470
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:43,940
calm down, please.

471
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:45,500
Aren't you from Qianjin House?

472
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,060
What does that have to do with this?

473
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:48,220
Forget about Qianjin House tonight.

474
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:49,260
We're all here

475
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:50,300
for the music.

476
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:51,100
Everyone.

477
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:54,020
Baihua Hall is treating us unfairly.

478
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:55,300
Don't you think so?

479
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,500
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

480
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:58,100
Yeah!

481
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:58,900
Why him?

482
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:01,180
Please, gentlemen.

483
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,100
Yes, it's inappropriate.

484
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:04,180
I guess I'm not going.

485
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:06,660
Do you know who you're rejecting?

486
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:09,580
Wait, don't be angry, miss.

487
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:11,060
That's enough.

488
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:13,700
It's not easy to meet someone
who resonates with you.

489
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:14,580
Who knows,

490
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:15,700
she might be from your hometown.

491
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:16,500
Calm down, Second Master Tu.

492
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:17,020
Calm down.

493
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,100
Calm down, everyone.

494
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:30,500
Let me get some fine liquor
for all of you.

495
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:31,500
He's going up just like that?

496
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:32,940
Isn't anyone going to stop him?

497
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:33,740
Don't you go there!

498
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:34,820
Let's see who dares challenge me.

499
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,980
Fine, fine.

500
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:41,100
Dumbo!

501
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:42,100
You piece of junk!

502
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:45,980
Go ahead.

503
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:52,660
I...

504
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:54,940
Calm down, Second Master Tu.

505
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:00,740
Young man.

506
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:02,740
Madam.

507
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:05,540
Can you get me a table

508
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:07,180
so I could wait for him?

509
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:08,460
Sir,

510
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:10,420
are you sure he'll be back

511
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,500
by tonight?

512
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:14,180
The night is young

513
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:15,300
and he's got a lady in his arms.

514
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:17,020
Who knows how long they'd take?

515
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:18,180
Why don't I

516
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:19,740
get you another girl

517
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:21,340
to keep you company?

518
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:22,340
No need.

519
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:23,220
That's not necessary.

520
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:26,020
Sikong Changfeng,

521
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:28,740
I won't be waiting for you tonight.

522
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:31,740
Enjoy.

523
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,700
Come again!

524
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:37,500
Come on.

525
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:46,260
Thank you.

526
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:56,020
Is it you?

527
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:57,780
Greetings, miss.

528
00:23:58,260 --> 00:23:59,020
My name is Sikong Changfeng.

529
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:01,260
Are you from the Wei City?

530
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:03,740
The Wei City?

531
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:06,020
Where do you come from?

532
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:07,460
I don't remember.

533
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:09,300
Then, where did you learn

534
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:10,940
to play that score?

535
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:12,740
I don't remember that as well.

536
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:15,900
Why can't you remember anything?

537
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:17,660
Are you just plain forgetful,

538
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:18,780
or is there something wrong
with your brain?

539
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,500
Don't be mad, miss.

540
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:22,420
I really can't

541
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:23,460
remember my past.

542
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:25,540
I have been wandering
around Jiangnan since young.

543
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:27,260
Perhaps it was

544
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:28,260
a traveler

545
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:29,020
who taught me the score.

546
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:30,820
When I heard you playing it,

547
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:32,900
I couldn't help but accompany.

548
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:35,020
I hope you won't blame me for it.

549
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:37,540
I didn't mean to blame you.

550
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:39,580
It was me who lost my composure.

551
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:42,780
I had a big brother

552
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:44,900
who could play this score as well.

553
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:48,020
I mistook you for him.

554
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:49,940
Looks like

555
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,660
I overthought it.

556
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:54,140
You may leave now.

557
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:56,100
Don't tell anyone

558
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:58,740
about my brother

559
00:24:58,980 --> 00:24:59,900
or how I lost my composure.

560
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:00,980
Don't tell anyone else

561
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:02,260
and ruin

562
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:03,460
my reputation out there.

563
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:05,540
Well, miss?

564
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:07,020
Why do you keep calling me?

565
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:09,860
Actually,

566
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:13,100
I'd love to have a little sister.

567
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:15,740
How impudent of you.

568
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:16,540
Someone,

569
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:17,460
get this shameless man

570
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:18,220
out of here.

571
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:19,060
Wait, wait.

572
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:19,860
Miss,

573
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:21,420
hear me out.

574
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:22,900
That's not what I meant.

575
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:24,740
I've been a vagrant my whole life

576
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:26,220
and I've never been envious

577
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:26,900
of people who have parents,

578
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:28,220
but I've always wanted

579
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:29,620
to have a little sister.

580
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:31,220
Having a little sister feels like

581
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:33,460
having someone to protect.

582
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:35,980
That's why...

583
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:40,220
That's why I think

584
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:41,500
that if I had

585
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,500
a sister to protect,

586
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:44,180
that would be something

587
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:45,700
that I can take pride in.

588
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:51,180
I won't be your sister.

589
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:52,180
Why?

590
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:55,980
Miss,

591
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:59,220
what's your brother's name?

592
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:00,620
Wei Luoli.

593
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:02,980
Alright, from now on,

594
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:04,340
my name will be Wei Luoli.

595
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:15,940
You...

596
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:18,220
How dare you tease me time and again?

597
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:23,920
[Feng Qiuyu,
Top Courtesan of Baihua Hall]

598
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:32,940
You didn't kick me that hard.

599
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:34,340
That means

600
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:36,500
you weren't really angry.

601
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:39,460
Miss,

602
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:40,740
I may have forgotten

603
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:41,980
whether I'm from Wei or not,

604
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:44,020
but we're both from Jiangnan.

605
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:45,780
And we know the same score.

606
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:46,940
This shows

607
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:49,460
that we have an affinity.

608
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:51,940
Just now, I said

609
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:53,100
that I wanted

610
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,140
a sister like you

611
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:55,780
and I mean it.

612
00:26:59,380 --> 00:26:59,820
Yes,

613
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:01,420
this is our first time meeting.

614
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:02,580
Getting a brother

615
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:03,780
all of a sudden for no reason

616
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:05,820
must be confusing for you.

617
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:08,100
I have crossed the line.

618
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:12,060
I'm not from Jiangnan.

619
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:13,820
I'm from...

620
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:17,100
You're trying to trick me again.

621
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:19,300
No, miss.

622
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:20,660
I have a friend who said

623
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:23,020
that words could be deceiving,

624
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:24,180
but music couldn't.

625
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,420
That's because music is the purest

626
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:29,420
and cleanest thing in the whole world.

627
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:30,820
So, miss,

628
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:32,500
no matter where you're from,

629
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:35,140
what you miss most is Jiangnan.

630
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:37,620
The person you care about the most
is also there.

631
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:40,620
What is your friend's name?

632
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,020
Baili Dongjun.

633
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:52,380
That's a fine name.

634
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:54,620
I'm tired.

635
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:56,860
Let's end this conversation for now.

636
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:58,180
Linglong.

637
00:27:59,140 --> 00:27:59,820
See our guest off.

638
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:02,540
Miss.

639
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:05,140
You may meet many people
throughout your life,

640
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:06,500
but only befriend a few.

641
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:08,940
I believe that true friends do exist.

642
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:11,100
Your guqin and my leaf

643
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:12,780
resonated together.

644
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:15,060
I will be back.

645
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:22,260
Now you sound

646
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:23,820
like a scholar.

647
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:38,500
If you ask me,

648
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:40,260
I'm just a vagabond.

649
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:55,580
Miss,

650
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:57,780
you seem to fancy...

651
00:28:58,220 --> 00:28:59,820
No, I mean, you don't hate him.

652
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:05,180
He's interesting,

653
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:06,940
isn't he?

654
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:23,700
Luoxia, you frightened me.

655
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:27,020
What brings you here?

656
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:28,940
I've been practicing the whole day

657
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:30,180
under my master's watchful eye.

658
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:31,940
I thought we could
grab a drink together,

659
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:33,300
but you weren't here.

660
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:34,420
What a letdown.

661
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:46,620
You...

662
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:48,940
Did you go to a brothel?

663
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:52,020
It's not what you think.

664
00:29:58,460 --> 00:29:59,380
I knew it.

665
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:00,820
I can smell the scent of rouge.

666
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:02,060
Even the night breeze
couldn't blow it off you.

667
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,300
You did visit a brothel.

668
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:04,420
That's not a brothel.

669
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:05,420
It's Baihua Hall,

670
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:06,300
a place for music.

671
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:08,020
I heard

672
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:09,060
that you

673
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:10,100
had a girl that you fancied,

674
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:12,380
but now,

675
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:14,660
you're visiting a brothel.

676
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:16,660
I guess you didn't fancy that girl

677
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:17,780
very much.

678
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:18,900
That's not true.

679
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:20,500
It was Second Senior Lei
who brought me there.

680
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:21,500
Besides, before I got there,

681
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:22,060
I didn't even know

682
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:22,820
what kind of place it was.

683
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:23,820
You didn't know before,

684
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:24,260
then what about

685
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:25,340
after you got there?

686
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:26,700
You do reek of rouge.

687
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:28,140
You must have spent

688
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:28,740
quite a while there.

689
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:29,860
Yes, I did.

690
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:31,180
But that's because...

691
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:32,460
Miss Li went there too

692
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:33,580
and my friend

693
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:34,580
met a girl there.

694
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:34,980
And...

695
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:38,740
I'm not really explaining much here.

696
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:40,140
So, where's your friend?

697
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:44,140
Yes,

698
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:45,940
I went to a brothel,

699
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:46,620
so what?

700
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:47,740
Why are you getting mad?

701
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:49,220
I'm mad?

702
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:51,100
I'm mad

703
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:52,860
because I've been practicing
the whole day

704
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:54,100
while you're having a blast outside.

705
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:55,620
I feel that this is unfair, okay?

706
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:57,460
Luoxia, listen to me...

707
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:03,220
Shameless.

708
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:11,860
What have I done wrong?

709
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:22,340
I'm supposed to gather

710
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:23,460
information about Ye Dingzhi.

711
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:25,780
Why did I argue

712
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:27,900
with Baili Dongjun instead

713
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:31,260
and even slap his face?

714
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:33,940
Forget it.

715
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:36,780
I should try to contact Qixuan.

716
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:43,620
He's coming out!

717
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:55,980
That's all he can do?

718
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:02,780
That was fast.

719
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:05,100
Yeah, is this supposed
to take a long time?

720
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:11,860
Everyone,

721
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,340
it's not what you think.

722
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:14,180
Miss Feng and I

723
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:14,980
were just talking about music.

724
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,020
I didn't do anything to her.

725
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:16,500
Phooey!

726
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:18,260
Then what

727
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:19,460
happened to your hair?

728
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:21,020
Yeah!

729
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:22,140
Before this, Miss Feng

730
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,740
had only performed
and never offered other services.

731
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:25,420
Who do you think you are?

732
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:25,900
No...

733
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:27,100
Who are you to do this? How dare you!

734
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:27,900
Everyone,

735
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:29,700
my hair came undone because...

736
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:30,340
That's enough.

737
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:32,940
Everyone,
stop listening to his nonsense.

738
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:33,780
Beat him up!

739
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:34,620
Beat him up!

740
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:35,860
Wait, everyone!

741
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:39,340
No,

742
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:40,620
it's a misunderstanding!

743
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:41,700
Don't let him get away!

744
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:42,220
I'm off!

745
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:43,580
After him!

746
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:44,540
Beat him up!

747
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:58,860
Miss Feng, what are you thinking?

748
00:32:59,260 --> 00:32:59,980
You should get some rest.

749
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:02,060
Linglong,

750
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:05,340
have I ever told you

751
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:07,460
about Luoli?

752
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:10,420
Do you want
to have a heart-to-heart talk, miss?

753
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:11,860
A heart-to-heart talk?

754
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:16,020
Maybe I just want

755
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:18,940
to pour out my feelings.

756
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:22,660
It's been such a long time.

757
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:26,300
I'm afraid
that even I might forget everything.

758
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:46,140
When I was little,

759
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:48,540
my whole family was exterminated.

760
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:52,580
My master escaped with me.

761
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:54,420
Along the way,

762
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:56,900
he met a kid, who then followed us.

763
00:33:58,660 --> 00:33:59,780
That kid

764
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:02,580
was Wei Luoli.

765
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:06,020
Every night,

766
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:09,180
he would pluck a leaf

767
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:12,940
and gaze at the moon under the eaves,

768
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:15,420
playing The Jiangnan Moon.

769
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:20,500
Whenever

770
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:23,420
he played the score,

771
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:25,660
I knew

772
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:28,900
he was missing home too.

773
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:30,700
What happened next?

774
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:33,420
One day, my master

775
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:36,540
went out with him,
together with his sword.

776
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:39,540
They never came back.

777
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:41,540
They said

778
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:46,180
my master and Luoli were dead.

779
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:48,700
Miss.

780
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:58,620
That's the end of the story.

781
00:34:58,860 --> 00:34:59,740
Time to get some rest.

782
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:01,980
You may leave now.

783
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:24,660
What's your name?

784
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:27,100
Wei Luoli.

785
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:29,980
Where's your family?

786
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:33,220
They're all dead.

787
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:35,220
Luoli,

788
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:37,460
let's be family from now on.

789
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:16,100
A showdown?

790
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:19,580
Yes, Your Majesty.

791
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:24,060
Baili Dongjun is challenging
Master Xie to a liquor showdown

792
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:25,900
in order to take

793
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:26,940
the 12-year-old Qiulubai.

794
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:28,700
Everyone in Tianqi knows about it now.

795
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:30,700
The Qiulubai

796
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:32,220
was made in the third year

797
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:33,500
of your reign.

798
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:37,300
When it was completed,

799
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:38,660
you said that if no one

800
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:40,620
could take it in the next 12 years,

801
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:42,260
you would use it

802
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:43,220
as an offering for the gods

803
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:44,580
during the harvest season.

804
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:48,380
Now that the 12 years are almost up,

805
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:51,860
Baili Dongjun is literally...

806
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:56,900
insulting you publicly.

807
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:32,980
Your Majesty, the chancellor is here.

808
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:44,660
[A sigh, and a storm brews]

809
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:45,860
Nice calligraphy.

810
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:47,300
Interesting.

811
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:48,940
As for the couplet,

812
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,060
it's just too pretentious.

813
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:54,660
Years ago,

814
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:57,300
when you presented this couplet to me,

815
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:58,780
I raved about it for a long time.

816
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:00,380
But now,

817
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:02,580
even you seem to dislike it.

818
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:05,660
People

819
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:08,780
always despise

820
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:11,140
their own past.

821
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:14,740
Greetings, Your Majesty.

822
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:15,900
Offer a seat to him.

823
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:17,220
Yes, Your Majesty.

824
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:31,500
Mr. Li, have some tea.

825
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:33,660
This tea

826
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:35,460
is a Nanjue specialty
known as Phoenix Snowflakes.

827
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:36,700
It's hard to come by.

828
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:37,980
Try it.

829
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:42,580
Your Majesty, why have you

830
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:43,380
summoned me today?

831
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:50,820
When I was young,
I was into poetry and books

832
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:52,580
instead of martial arts.

833
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:54,660
My mother was not favored either.

834
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:56,180
They all thought

835
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:57,580
I was the most unpromising one
among all the princes.

836
00:38:58,060 --> 00:38:59,700
Luckily, I had two close friends.

837
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:02,300
One was of the Ye Family from Yunxi,

838
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:04,460
and the other was
of the Baili Family from Xilin.

839
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:06,860
Both of them were exceptional warriors.

840
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:09,260
With their help,

841
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:10,500
I managed to survive

842
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:13,140
and ascend the throne.

843
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:15,660
Later...

844
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:18,660
I made a terrible mistake,

845
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:22,180
which still fills me

846
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:24,100
with much regret.

847
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:28,140
I received some news earlier,

848
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:29,340
so I summoned you here

849
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:32,020
to thank you in person.

850
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:33,740
That means

851
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:36,340
you're thanking me

852
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:37,940
for saving Ye Dingzhi?

853
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:39,100
Exactly.

854
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:41,420
Since you have realized your mistake,

855
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:42,820
why don't you reopen his case?

856
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:46,700
Forget it.

857
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:48,500
It's all about your dignity again.

858
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:49,980
Alright,

859
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:52,020
I've received your gratitude.

860
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:53,580
That's all, then.

861
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:54,860
I'm off.

862
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:55,820
Wait.

863
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:57,660
I summoned you here

864
00:39:57,660 --> 00:39:58,700
for another reason.

865
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:02,020
I heard that you recently

866
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:03,900
took in a new apprentice

867
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:05,540
surnamed Baili.

868
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:09,300
Baili Dongjun.

869
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:11,100
That is

870
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:12,820
the grandson of Baili Luochen,

871
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:14,820
another sworn brother of yours.

872
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:17,020
This time,

873
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:18,780
Luochen's grandson is in Tianqi

874
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:21,420
and I'd love to meet him.

875
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:22,060
That's not necessary.

876
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:29,380
Didn't you say

877
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:32,020
that you'd stay out
of the court's affairs?

878
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:33,420
Baili Dongjun is just

879
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:35,380
a normal apprentice of mine.

880
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:37,060
He has no official rank or title.

881
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:38,460
How is he

882
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:40,700
part of the court's affairs?

883
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:42,740
The grandson of the Marquis of Zhenxi

884
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:44,140
is in Tianqi,

885
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:46,340
yet he's not coming to meet me.

886
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:48,060
It's so improper.

887
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:49,980
You should be punishing
the Marquis of Zhenxi instead.

888
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:51,260
You've already killed

889
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:52,380
one of your sworn brothers anyway,

890
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:54,100
so a second one
probably makes no difference.

891
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:57,620
Your Majesty,

892
00:40:57,980 --> 00:40:58,740
why must you

893
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:00,540
lose your composure in front of me?

894
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:01,540
Rest assured,

895
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:02,900
Baili Dongjun won't be

896
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:04,540
staying in Tianqi forever.

897
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:06,460
I'm planning to leave the city with him

898
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:07,540
and travel around.

899
00:41:07,810 --> 00:41:08,570
He won't be back

900
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:09,700
in the next few years.

901
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:11,580
You are the chancellor, though.

902
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:13,260
Since I'm leaving,

903
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:14,540
someone more suitable

904
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:15,700
will naturally

905
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:17,060
take over my job.

906
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:18,660
Farewell.

907
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:21,100
What if I insist on keeping him here?

908
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:24,900
You can try.

909
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:33,020
Mr. Li,

910
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:36,260
don't you think that sometimes,

911
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:39,260
you can be too overbearing?

912
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:41,500
Is that so?

913
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:44,060
In front of you, I feel like...

914
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:48,980
you're the Emperor instead.

915
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:54,900
I am an Immortal.

916
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:57,060
A mortal emperor like you

917
00:41:57,900 --> 00:41:59,220
should stop bothering me.

918
