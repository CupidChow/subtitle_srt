00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:33,500
♫  Overcoming self-doubt and finding purpose  ♫

3
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,280
♫  Enduring the trials of life and death  ♫

4
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:40,800
♫  As I gaze into the dark night  ♫

5
00:00:41,502 --> 00:00:44,180
♫  My spirit has not been broken  ♫

6
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:46,920
♫  And unleash this passion  ♫

7
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:51,840
♫  My spirit will only grow stronger  ♫

8

♫  Splitting mountains and parting seas  ♫

9
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:57,400
♫  Answering the sword's call and entering the Martial World  ♫

10
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:02,440
♫  I'm the chosen one, fate in this turbulent world  ♫

11
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:05,440
♫  Keeping my distance from the world  ♫

12
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,120
♫  Who can understand my loneliness?  ♫

13
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:11,920
♫  A single thought, gazing down  ♫

♫  With swords drawn, frost flies through the air  ♫

♫  With faith that conquers the world with one strike  ♫

16
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:22,520
♫  Soaring through the sky, the sword reigns everywhere  ♫

17
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,140
♫  Breaking through the waves, dancing drunkenly everywhere  ♫

18
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:27,860
♫  Protecting the people, no matter the cost  ♫

19
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:32,520
♫  Atop the peak, you and I shall battle all out  ♫

20
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,700

21
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:42,620

22
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:48,471

23
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:52,020

24
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,280
So?

25
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,340
Baili Dongjun did not take that path.

26
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:09,120
What? No way!

27
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:12,280
- I told Young Lady— 
 - Young Lady told him to not take that path then.

28
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,100
Shut up!

29
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,260
Young Lady...

30
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,900
With Young Lady's status,

31
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:23,060
she would not betray Tian Wai Tian.

32
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:27,720
Maybe she didn't betray Tian Wai Tian.

33
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,540
But one thing's for sure now.

34
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:34,060
She is not who she used to be.

35
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,880
I don't understand.

36
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,640
I don't know what Young Lady is thinking.

37
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:43,660
She's in Tianqi.

38
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:46,680
You can head there and ask her personally.

39
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:52,040
However, something else is more important now.

40
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,140
What is it?

41
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:58,640
I found...

42
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:03,500
another natural martial artist.

43
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:08,300
Another natural martial artist?

44
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,380
What is happening?

45
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:13,940
I didn't see Baili Dongjun, but I saw two other people.

46
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:16,900
One of them overexerted his inner strength within a short time.

47
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:19,100
He might have used the Immovable Lord Technique.

48
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:22,280
- Immovable Lord Technique? 
 - Exactly.

49
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:26,940
When we fought, he forced himself to use his inner strength.

50
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:30,020
How brave of him.

51
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:34,420
Those who wish to practice the Immovable Lord Technique must have a robust meridian system.

52
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:38,940
If one's inner strength is depleted while using it, one's meridian system will be damaged.

53
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:42,340
To force himself to generate inner strength within a short period of time...

54
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:46,800
Does he want to be crippled forever?

55
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,180
Here comes the interesting part.

56
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:53,120
I noticed his meridian system is not damaged at all.

57
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,740
A natural martial artist.

58
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:58,140
I thought the same way.

59
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:01,220
Only a natural martial artist has such a robust meridian system.

60
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:04,200
Bringing him back would achieve our goal too.

61
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,160
- Where is he? 
 - Prince Jingyu's Mansion.

62
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,640
Prince Jingyu's Mansion?

63
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:15,020
Send a message to our sect and investigate the origin of this person.

64
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:20,640
Immovable Lord Technique is the signature technique of Nanjue's best martial artist, Rain Demon.

65
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:25,300
This natural martial artist must have an interesting background.

66
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:30,260
By the way Yuji, since last night

67
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:33,640
Twin Lords Wuzuo have been missing.

68
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,280
Did you find any sect's mark?

69
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:43,180
Normally if they leave Tianqi in advance,

70
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:47,860
they will inform us by letter or leave marks as they leave.

71
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:53,500
This seems to suggest that the situation is dire.

72
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:04,860
He looks just like Brother Yun when he was little.

73
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:07,920
I wonder how Brother Yun is doing now.

74
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,800
Junior Sister.

75
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,480
The other person is awake.

76
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,400
Thank you for saving me, Miss.

77
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,420
Spare the formalities when you're still injured.

78
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:43,000
- As for my friend... 
 - Don't worry.

79
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,140
He'll be fine as long as I'm here.

80
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:47,380
Thank you, Miss.

81
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:50,580
Miss, may I know where we are?

82
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,820
Prince Jingyu's Mansion.

83
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:55,620
What? Prince Jingyu's Mansion?

84
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:58,920
- Then you're... 
 - Of course, I'm the future Princess Consort Jingyu.

85
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:02,420
It's just that I'm not married yet.

86
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:05,660
- So His Highness saved us? 
 - No, I did.

87
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:08,700
Prince Jingyu has nothing to do with this.

88
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:11,580
It just so happened that you fell into my yard.

89
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:14,960
And I, and this...

90
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,570
Ye Dingzhi.

91
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,420
Ye Dingzhi.

92
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:25,180
It sounds like a heroic name.

93
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:30,280
Ye Dingzhi caught my eye so I saved you two.

94
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,080
That's all?

95
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,160
Yes.

96
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,700
Master.

97
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,220
Master?

98
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:54,140
Is he already here?

99
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,300
I guess not.

100
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:06,180
Dongjun, I don't think Ye Dingzhi is coming.

101
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,020
Impossible.

102
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:14,440
Let's wait a bit longer. He'll be here for sure.

103
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:17,820
No. You've been waiting for a day.

104
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,780
Did something bad happen?

105
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:21,880
Dongjun.

106
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:25,320
Taking someone as your master is not just about your potential or luck.

107
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:28,540
Do you know what the most important part is?

108
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:30,340
It's fate.

109
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:34,220
It seems like I am fated to take only one disciple today.

110
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,520
No.

111
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,460
I have to go find him.

112
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:26,760
His Highness seems to be really careless.

113
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:29,080
He doesn't even come to this huge yard.

114
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:32,340
There's only his future consort and her senior.

115
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:40,080
That's so fast!

116
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,340
Mind your word, Sir.

117
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:48,080
My senior will soon become someone even Prince Jingyu would not want to mess with.

118
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:12,500
Junior Sister.

119
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,580
Senior, don't worry.

120
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:18,540
I know what I'm doing.

121
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:58,820
Being good-looking comes with its own perks.

122
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:01,380
What do you mean?

123
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:06,720
If you were in his place, you might not have been given this Frostpeak Water.

124
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:12,680
I look charming, don't I?

125
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,860
Far worse than him.

126
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:44,040
Water...

127
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,260
Water...

128
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:20,580
Fairy... Fairy...

129
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,500
It's all right.

130
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:57,880
Brother Ye, are you awake? You...

131
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:01,140
Watch out.

132
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:07,000
Senior, Hero Wang.

133
00:12:10,025 --> 00:12:12,025

134
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:18,780
This is Luo Qingyang. He's...

135
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:23,960
He's the head disciple of the Shadow Sect, Luo Qingyang.

136
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:28,520
Have we met before?

137
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:32,520
 He is Luo Qingyang. Then she is...

138
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:35,060
 Brother Yun, over here!

139
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:36,880
 She is...

140
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,860
 Wenjun.

141
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:59,780
Why are you gawking? Oh, right. This is our savior, Princess Consort Jingyu.

142
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:03,820
Don't call me Princess Consort. Prince Jingyu and I aren't married yet.

143
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:10,900
Hero Wang, how is your injury?

144
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:16,000
Thanks to your and Brother Luo's timely rescue, there were no internal injuries. I am completely healed now.

145
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,460
Well, you're not being chased by those fighters anymore, are you?

146
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:26,020
No way. His Majesty once gave Mount Wangcheng the Plaque of Integrity.

147
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:30,060
It proves that we have high integrity and are to be treated as esteemed guests everywhere we go.

148
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:33,840
That night was nothing but an accident.

149
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:39,640
If so, why are you still here?

150
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:51,800
Well, Brother Ye, are you...

151
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:57,280
I...

152
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:54,360
You're awake.

153
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:04,340
Little girl, where am I?

154
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:08,800
You're at my home. My father brought you back.

155
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,760
I know this is your home. So, who are you?

156
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,300
I am Li Hanyi.

157
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,700
 Li Hanyi?

158
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:26,200
I see.

159
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:31,260
You're Mister Li's daughter.

160
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:35,640
How old is he? His daughter is so young.

161
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:45,041
Hanyi, our guest is awake?

162
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,360
Mother.

163
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,660
Oh, my.

164
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,700
Oh, my.

165
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:05,380
Mother, that uncle is very odd. Is something wrong with his head?

166
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:08,500
He's as annoying as Father.

167
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:12,680
Mind your words. You can't call him that.

168
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:22,620
Greetings, Master's Wife.

169
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:27,700
I am Baili Dongjun. Nice to meet you.

170
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:39,300
How come I do not know that I have a disciple now?

171
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:45,380
This is my wife. This is my daughter. This is my house, you fool.

172
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,780
Did you just call her Master's Wife?

173
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:52,380
I know that by right I am your senior.

174
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:55,220
And I don't mind you treating me as your master.

175
00:16:55,220 --> 00:17:00,000
How about this? Don't call me Master. Call me Father instead.

176
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,700
Go away! I only had the wrong idea because your daughter's surname is Li.

177
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,820
She took my surname.

178
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,680
May I know your name?

179
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:13,180
I am Li Xinyue of Sword Heart Tomb.

180
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:20,700
My uncle told me it's a sword-forging family far superior to Famous Swords Manor.

181
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:25,880
Not bad, Brother Lei. You are formidable outside, but when you're home, you're a matrilocal husband.

182
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,640
Of course.

183
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:36,100
T-The Lei Family of Thunderbolt Sect is just as famous in the martial arts world.

184
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:39,580
D-Don't call me a matrilocal husband. I... I'll kill you.

185
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:42,060
Then tell me why your daughter didn't take your surname.

186
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:45,580
I... She... I...

187
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:52,720
Because Father was expelled from Lei Fortress. His children cannot take Lei as their surname.

188
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:57,660
I don't want Lei as my surname either. It sounds fierce.

189
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:04,280
Hanyi, let's go back inside. Let your father talk to this uncle here.

190
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,860
Let's go.

191
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:15,140
Fine. Now that you're awake, I'll take you to see Master.

192
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:16,780
Wait.

193
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,760
Where is Ye Dingzhi? Did he come back?

194
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:25,920
No. I have to find him.

195
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:28,420
You don't need to find him.

196
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:30,620
Brother Wang, you're back.

197
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:35,180
Where is Ye Dingzhi? Did he enter the Academy already?

198
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:41,920
Well, he is recuperating at the safest place in Tianqi City.

199
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:47,300
He's accompanied by a ravishing beauty. You don't need to worry about him.

200
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,520
What do you mean?

201
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:54,860
 If so, why are you still here?

202
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:04,700
 Fine.

203
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,640
 Well, Brother Ye, are you...

204
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:11,920
 I...

205
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:15,980
 I won't leave yet.

206
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:19,000
 Brother Wang.

207
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:24,780
 Please tell Dongjun to put effort into learning from Mister Li.

208
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:26,960
 I'll wait for the day when he becomes famous.

209
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,340
That's all?

210
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:30,720
- He only said that? 
 - Yes.

211
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,740
Brother Wang.

212
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:39,620
Who else, other than you, knows that the lady saved you?

213
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:43,260
Other than us, our mysterious pursuer knows about it too.

214
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:45,760
Don't tell anyone else, then.

215
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:49,580
The affairs of the court can be quite complicated.

216
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:53,620
Since that lady said that her help was something personal,

217
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:55,860
Prince Jingyu might not be aware of it.

218
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:58,280
Don't worry. I know what to do.

219
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:01,553
Oh, right. I heard the purple-robed man say

220
00:20:01,553 --> 00:20:05,560
that Ye Dingzhi was a natural martial artist as well. He wanted to take him somewhere.

221
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:12,440
In that case, staying with Princess Consort Jingyu is indeed his safest bet.

222
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:15,900
What exactly is a natural martial artist?

223
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:20,100
Well, Master should have the answer to that.

224
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:26,000

225
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,060
I'll see you off here, then.

226
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:31,860
I have completed my task and should return to Mount Wangcheng.

227
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:33,580
Thank you for your assistance, Brother Wang.

228
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:36,920
The world is vast. May we meet again.

229
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,060
Greet.

230
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:35,640

Sure.

- He actually dodged it. 
 - He actually dodged it.

264
00:23:56,577 --> 00:23:58,757
Curse it!

265
00:23:58,757 --> 00:24:04,337
I managed to prank all his seniors but he dodged it like I did when I was young.

266
00:24:04,337 --> 00:24:06,857
That's not good.

267
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:20,560
So boring. You're really boring.

268
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:23,740
It's a solemn ritual, but you're pulling a trick I used to play.

269
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:25,660
I am the overlord of Qiandong City.

270
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:28,320
Try something new next time.

271
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:30,300
All right.

272
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:33,340
While the opening act leaves much to be desired,

273
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:38,740
let's get back to business and begin the Academy's apprenticeship ritual.

274
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:40,480
Baili Dongjun.

275
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:43,100
Yin Luoxia.

276
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:45,140
I am Xiao Ruofeng.

277
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:47,180
I know that already.

278
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:50,420
I am Mister Li's seventh disciple.

279
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:55,900
From now on, you may call me Seventh Senior, or Seventh Martial Uncle.

280
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:59,840
Of course, you can call me Little Senior too.

281
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:03,040
Senior.

282
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,940
Seventh Martial Uncle.

283
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:15,020
I'm Mister Li's sixth disciple, Luo Xuan.

284
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:18,100
Sixth Senior.

285
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,900
Sixth Martial Uncle.

286
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:23,920
I'm Mister Li's fourth disciple.

287
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:26,280
- Mo... 
 - Liu Yue.

288
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:28,740
Xiaohei.

289
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:37,720
Fifth Martial Uncle.

290
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:55,520
Master.

291
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:07,620
It sure is different when one has a disciple already.

292
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:09,340
Don't you think so?

293
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:12,100
Get up.

294
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:20,520
Senior Mochen.

295
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:23,020
Senior Liu Yue.

296
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:30,500
Isn't this Young Master Lingyun, Gu Jianmen?

297
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:35,300
Gu Jianmen is your Third Senior.

298
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:41,240
And I am Mister Li's second disciple,

299
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:47,460
also known as Young Master Zhuomo and your Second Senior.

300
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:49,420
Second Senior?

301
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,340
Lei'er sounds better to my ears.

302
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:56,860
How rude of you.

303
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:04,180
Address me properly.

304
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:07,120
- Quickly. 
 - Fine. Just to make you look good.

305
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:09,600
Second Senior.

306
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:12,720
Second Martial Uncle.

307
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:15,140
Hi, Junior.

308
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:18,180
Hi, Junior Niece.

309
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:23,380
Where is First Senior?

310
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:28,940
He never existed.

311
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:31,140
When I started here, I was already the second disciple.

312
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:34,060
I have never seen him. None of them have seen him either.

313
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:35,860
Master never explained.

314
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:38,140
How odd.

315
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:39,280
Exactly.

316
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:44,420
Master said that the odder a person was, the more likely he'd become a martial genius.

317
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:46,140
Look at me. I am odd.

318
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:49,920
Liu Yue is also odd. They are odd. And you...

319
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,700
Are you complimenting me?

320
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:53,020
Yes.

321
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:55,020
Master is the oddest of them all.

322
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:57,820
 Lei'er, you talk too much.

323
00:27:57,820 --> 00:27:59,500
All right.

324
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:01,140
Junior.

325
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:03,440
Go.

326
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:08,460
Must you do this?

327
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:15,940
You don't need to do this to me.

328
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:18,960
You're becoming my disciple, not getting married.

329
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,900
Master.

330
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:25,660
Dongba, from now on, you are my youngest disciple.

331
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:33,020
Master, please accept my bow.

332
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:34,600
Wonderful.

333
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:40,140
Did you just call me "Dongba"?

334
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:45,140
Lei'er, Jiansan, Liusi, Heiwu, Xuanliu, and Fengqi. You will naturally be Dongba.

335
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:48,440
Master. You're really so boring.

336
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:50,860
Yes.

337
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:57,820
I've lived so long that many things become boring.

338
00:28:57,820 --> 00:29:00,940
Therefore, I must do something to entertain myself.

339
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:03,260
How long have you lived?

340
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:12,800
Back then, my slash shook the Heavens.

341
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:17,000
Immortals descended and told me that I did not belong to the mortal realm,

342
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,600
and that I should live in Heaven.

343
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,900
They wanted to take me with them but I said no.

344
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:28,200
The Immortals then touched my head and said that they would give me immortality

345
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,600
so that I could experience the mortal life fully.

346
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:34,800
This scene was witnessed by the Poetry Deity, and a great poem was born.

347
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:38,980
A divine touch on my head and thus I was given a long life.

348
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,300
Guess how long I have lived?

349
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:43,900
Is this true?

350
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:46,980
Of course...

351
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:49,940
it's fake.

352
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,800
- Why is this disciple so stupid? 
 - This old geezer.

353
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:56,500
People from the Martial World are cunning.

354
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,500
You know what? I'll take you out one month from now.

355
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:03,500
I'll show you the worst of the Martial World.

356
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,400
Why one month from now?

357
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:08,300
Don't you want to drink Qiulubai from Diaolou Tavern?

358
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:11,800
Qiulubai is only available once per month.

359
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,800
Oh, no. It's all gone for this month.

360
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,800
Worry not. Just wait until next month.

361
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:25,400
You can drink to your heart's content and then we'll depart.

362
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,000
Oh right. Master.

363
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Someone once hinted at me that I was a natural martial artist.

364
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Wang also told me just now that Ye Dingzhi was a natural martial artist.

365
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,400
What does that mean?

366
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:47,180
Being a natural martial artist is both a blessing, and a curse.

367
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,000
All right.

368
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
That's all for today's questions.

369
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,600
I'm sleepy.

370
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,300
Wait.

371
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,700
What a weird and stubborn old man.

372
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:10,560
Come on.

373
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:15,380
Tell me. What nickname did Master give you?

374
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:20,200
I wonder what he called you. Maybe Bailiba?

375
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,900
But Mo Xiaohei said Master was lazy and he'd only use a two-syllable nickname.

376
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:26,700
He thinks your nickname is Liba. So, what's your nickname?

377
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,600
Dongba.

378
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:42,800
Oh, fellow seniors. Master told me that he had lived a long life.

379
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,600
How old is he?

380
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,200
We have no idea either.

381
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:49,200
Last year, he celebrated his 80th birthday.

382
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,900
This year, he celebrated his 70th birthday.

383
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:53,800
I guess next year, it'll be his 100th birthday.

384
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,300
That's the way he is.

385
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:58,400
He makes up things on the spot. Just ignore him.

386
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:01,500
Dongba.

387
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:03,400
Lei'er.

388
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,500
- Dongba. 
 - Lei'er.

389
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,600
- Dongba. 
 - Er.

390
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:18,260
I...

391
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:48,200
You look like you're having the world's best delicacy.

392
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,000
I took a bite,

393
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,900
but it's just a plate of pickled vegetables so salty it could kill a cow.

394
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:56,700
And the cheapest liquor sold in the town ahead.

395
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:59,100
Yet you actually enjoyed them.

396
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:03,300
If you nearly starved to death once,

397
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:06,000
you'd be forever grateful for every kind of food in this world.

398
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:11,200
You were nearly killed by your illness, why aren't you grateful for these herbs?

399
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,900
How could you just sit and watch as your master grinds herbs?

400
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:21,800
Anyway, I have learned all you have to teach me.

401
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:24,900
- Based on our agreement, tomorrow— 
 - As soon as the sun rises tomorrow

402
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:26,900
you will have nothing more to do with herbs.

403
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:30,300
I remember this. I do.

404
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:38,080
I might just be the most pathetic master in this world.

405
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,800
You have the talent for medicine.

406
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,400
In a few months

407
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:47,700
you've mastered what would take an ordinary person years or decades to learn.

408
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:50,100
Why aren't you interested in it?

409
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:58,000
How long have you stayed in the valley?

410
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:03,000
I came to Medicine Valley when I was 12.

411
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:07,000
I suppose it has been 26 years.

412
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,700
That's so long.

413
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:10,800
Do you feel lonely?

414
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,500
The valley is secluded. No one comes here.

415
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:16,400
Even if they do you only see people on the brink of death like me.

416
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:20,700
I think, since you're great at medicine you should go out.

417
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:24,300
Some want to make a name for themselves and make big achievements.

418
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:27,400
Some just want to enjoy peace alone.

419
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:31,900
How many lives cross over today, and how many lives are born?

420
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:33,600
It's all destiny.

421
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:37,500
Even if I go out, how many lives can I save?

422
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:43,200
If, like you, they stumble upon Medicine Valley, they are fated to see me.

423
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:47,900
Regardless of their background or motive, I will save them.

424
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,800
So you're happy to live like this forever?

425
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:54,100
A life without any change?

426
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:57,800
In your eyes I'm doing the same thing everyday.

427
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:02,400
But in my eyes every day is different.

428
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:06,500
In spring, Zhuwang Grass will grow on the cliff.

429
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:10,100
During the solar term, Jingzhe, night dews can compliment Baiqing Pills.

430
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:14,100
Horseweeds in Qingming can be made into herb bricks.

431
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:16,900
How is this doing the same thing?

432
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:21,900
What's on your mind?

433
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:24,200
Your friend?

434
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,800
Yes.

435
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:28,200
I wonder how he's doing in Tianqi City.

436
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,500
Is he as cocky as usual?

437
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:34,300
 I came all the way to run a tavern here.

438
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:36,600
 Of course, I have some tricks up my sleeves.

439
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,300
 Run!

440
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,720
 Is he being hunted by someone?

441
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:46,720
 Is he accompanied by trusted friends?

442
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:11,900
In fact, one day I'll leave this valley too.

443
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:19,500
To admire and travel the world outside.

444
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,600
When?

445
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:29,060
When I find a real heir, your junior.

446
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:35,300
I'm sorry, then. I will not stay by your side.

447
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:41,700
I will pulverize the medicine into pills and put them in your luggage.

448
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:45,500
Take one after lunch every day. There are 100 pills in total.

449
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:48,600
I also asked for a specific herbal powder from the Mu Family of Qingzhou.

450
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:56,500
I don't want them to know where I live, so please help me retrieve it.

451
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:03,500
But Qingzhou is too far.

452
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:04,900
What Qingzhou?

453
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:09,500
The Mu Family's best apothecary is Qiulu Apothecary and it's in Tianqi City.

454
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:12,100
And you're heading to Tianqi City.

455
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:15,800
Don't you want to go there?

456
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,200
Go, then.

457
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:20,100
100 pills are enough to keep you alive until next year.

458
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:22,500
Enjoy your stay in Tianqi City.

459
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:26,000
But do come back to brush up on your knowledge.

460
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:46,100
The pills are not ready yet.

461
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:48,100
No need to be this eager.

462
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,800
Tianqi City, here I come!

463
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:34,200
This dish is called Caged Bird.

464
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:38,100
And this one is called Distant World.

465
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:41,000
Please, Young Master Ye.

466
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,700
Brother Luo is not eating?

467
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:52,180
My senior trains diligently and he is used to an ascetic diet.

468
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:54,220
No need to worry about him.

469
00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:01,080
Princess Consort, what are you trying to convey

470
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:03,860
by making these two dishes for me?

471
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:06,620
I told you not to call me Princess Consort.

472
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:11,820
I don't want to be a princess consort.

473
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:18,160
Sure.

474
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:24,100
If not, Miss, what do you want to talk about?

475
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:26,740
Tell me, Young Master Ye.

476
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:28,900
Why did you stay?

477
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:32,160
I must repay your favor.

478
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,140
As expected from someone I saved.

479
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:39,640
When I first saw you, I knew you'd be a grateful and loyal person.

480
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:44,580
It's not because of my good looks?

481
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:52,360
In fact, when I was unconscious I could hear what you said.

482
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:55,740
Stop it.

483
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:59,800
All right, enough joking.

484
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:04,100
How do you want me to repay your kindness?

485
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:08,800
I will do everything I can for you.

486
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,820
It's not that serious.

487
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:13,620
Can you...

488
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:17,400
Can you tell me about the world outside?

489
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:20,620
Once you're done, I'll let you go.

490
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:28,280
I have been staying here for a long time.

491
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:33,060
While Senior is here, he doesn't talk a lot.

492
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:37,120
So I hardly talk to anyone.

493
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:43,500
Like this dish, Caged Bird, I am caged.

494
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:48,620
But I long for the world outside.

495
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:52,500
 She is actually leading an unhappy life.

496
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:51,100
You...

497
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:57,280
A leaf fell on your hair.

498
00:41:58,540 --> 00:42:00,560
Oh, a leaf.

499
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:12,660
My martial prowess isn't the best yet.

500
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:17,200
My eloquence is not so good.

501
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,880
But when it comes to my travel experience,

502
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:24,480
you might not be able to find someone as well-traveled as myself in Tianqi City.

503
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:27,480
Where have you been?

504
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:30,420
I went to the 32 Buddhist States in the Western Regions.

505
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:33,060
There's a very interesting city.

506
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:35,840
It's unoccupied, called Muliang.

507
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:38,600
When I was 13, I followed my master to Nanjue.

508
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:40,440
I traveled as I practiced martial arts.

509
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:43,040
The southernmost place I've been to is Mufeng Sea.

510
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:48,380
And then I traveled north to the northernmost city in Beiman called Suiye.

511
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:52,600
I was told that the Beiman people were ruthless.

512
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:57,520
In a fight the winner can take away the loser's tent and wife.

513
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:59,320
Until a new challenger emerges.

514
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:00,560
You're wrong.

515
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:03,620
The Beiman people are actually very kind.

516
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:08,040
When I was there, I stayed with a family.

517
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:09,880
They are just like us.

518
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:12,740
They only marry one person in their lives.

519
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:15,200
The husband will leave in the morning to hunt.

520
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:19,620
The grassland there is huge, almost borderless.

521
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:16,960
Junior.

522
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:21,120
Senior.

523
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:24,280
You want Ye Dingzhi to help you escape.

524
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:31,070
Senior.

525
00:44:31,070 --> 00:44:33,520
We grew up together.

526
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:35,500
But now...

527
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:39,620
I am a caged bird.

528
00:44:39,620 --> 00:44:43,540
And you are the cage warden.

529
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:48,840
You know I don't want to marry Prince Jingyu.

530
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:51,900
But I can't defeat you in a fight.

531
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:57,060
But Ye Dingzhi might be able to do that.

532
00:45:00,260 --> 00:45:06,020
If he defeats me, he earns the chance to leave this mansion.

533
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:14,380
But if he finds out that you're just using him...

534
00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:16,280
Using him?

535
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:22,060
When I listened to his stories, I felt happy.

536
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:29,520
And he feels so familiar to me.

537
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:33,140
His surname is also Ye.

538
00:45:41,020 --> 00:45:42,441

539
00:45:42,441 --> 00:45:44,760

540
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:58,820

541
00:45:58,820 --> 00:46:07,691
♫  A gentle breeze intentionally stirs the heart  ♫

542
00:46:07,691 --> 00:46:15,567
♫  Moored by the lake, ripples spread, feet covered with spring mud  ♫

543
00:46:15,567 --> 00:46:24,947
♫  The branches softly whisper secrets in the wind  ♫

544
00:46:26,115 --> 00:46:33,455
♫  In the moonlit night, I trace the outlines of your unfinished story  ♫

545
00:46:33,455 --> 00:46:36,535
♫  As if destined by fate, I gaze upon your quietly graceful figure  ♫

546
00:46:36,535 --> 00:46:38,995
♫  Restlessly searching for you  ♫

547
00:46:38,995 --> 00:46:43,235
♫  I'll follow you until sunset and late afternoon sunshine  ♫

548
00:46:43,235 --> 00:46:47,895
♫  Listening intently to the soft drizzle, accompanied by a lone shadow  ♫

549
00:46:47,895 --> 00:46:51,309
♫  Who am I with at this moment?  ♫

550
00:46:51,309 --> 00:46:54,269
♫  Roaming the world together in harmony  ♫

551
00:46:54,269 --> 00:46:56,789
♫  Two hearts cherishing each other  ♫

552
00:46:56,789 --> 00:47:01,209
♫  A red letter becomes a boat navigating our love  ♫

553
00:47:01,209 --> 00:47:05,669
♫  A folding fan sways among the stars and clouds  ♫

554
00:47:05,669 --> 00:47:08,869
♫  In this perfect moment  ♫

555
00:47:08,869 --> 00:47:14,349
♫  I met you  ♫

556
00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:58,873
♫  A gentle breeze intentionally stirs the heart  ♫
