24
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:01,300
I'm wondering

25
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:02,980
about one thing.

26
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:04,780
If you know

27
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:05,580
who I am,

28
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:07,740
what makes you think

29
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:09,780
that you can capture me?

30
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:11,660
Back then,

31
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:14,220
you fought 10,000 soldiers
with one sword.

32
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,020
After Western Chu fell,

33
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:17,060
everyone thought

34
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:19,060
you died too.

35
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:20,740
Given that circumstance,

36
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:23,220
even if you survived,

37
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,100
you must have sustained

38
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,940
heavy internal injuries.

39
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:29,860
If you are as powerful

40
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:31,180
as you were,

41
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:32,460
why didn't

42
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:34,220
you reveal yourself to the world?

43
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:37,460
Why didn't you avenge Western Chu?

44
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:38,620
Hence,

45
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:40,980
while you're still breathing,

46
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:43,900
you must have been greatly

47
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:46,500
weakened.

48
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:48,060
You think so?

49
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:57,580
That's just a gaudy move.

50
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,180
I haven't drawn my sword

51
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:43,540

I'm here to rescue my master.

55
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:01,460
Do you know who your master is?

56
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:02,860
It doesn't matter who he is.

57

What matters is

58
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,340
he will always be my master.

59
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,220
I was indeed heavily injured.

60
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,020
But in the past decades,

61
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,420
I mended my meridian system.

62
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:48,020

63

Thank you.

96
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:32,220
But perhaps

97
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:35,260
this is the best solution.

98
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:36,940
At this stage,

99
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,220

104
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:34,620
And now,

105
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,300
I'll teach you the other half of it.

106
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:39,500

Where should a deity dwell?

112
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:04,500
He points at the haven of Penglai.

113
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,460
It's a land of everything.

114
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,940

116
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:29,180
and mesmerizing beauties.

117
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,660
You will have what you desire.

118
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:46,340
When the deity sees it,

119
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:51,420
he looks around and feels lost.

120
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:22,860
Sirs!

121
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:30,100
My sword trembles with rage

122
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:33,980
as the sunset is dyed with blood.

123
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,180
So this

124
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:36,980
is the so-called

125
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:37,940

126
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,100
When I was young,

127
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:46,540
I thought I could rule the world

128
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,780
by mastering the strongest
sword technique.

129
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:50,460
And then, I realized,

130
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:53,980
to master the strongest technique

131
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:56,580
is to shoulder
the greatest responsibility.

132
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,420
Regretfully,

133
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:00,820
I couldn't

134
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:03,940
defend my country.

00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,500
Are you all right, Master?

192
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:56,020
Everyone.

193
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:57,380
Can I spend some time

194
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:58,380
with Dongjun

195
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:00,900
alone?

196
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:12,540
Sir.

197
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:16,540
Farewell.

198
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,180
Baili,

199
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:32,900
tell your mother that I'd be going.

200
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:34,940
Next spring,

201
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:36,580
I'll come and drink with you again.

202
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:37,660
Take care.

203
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:49,180
Master.

204
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:07,540
Dongjun,

205
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:10,780
come and drink with me.

206
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:20,180
Thank you...

207
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,380
for keeping me company all these years.

208
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:38,460
Dongjun.

209
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,340
Go to Tianqi City for me, will you?

210
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:45,740
Brew a pot of Peach Blossom Moonfall

211
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,220
and hang it at the tallest point

212
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:51,060
of Tianqi City.

213
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:57,780
No, Master.

214
00:14:58,700 --> 00:14:59,620
I'll bring you with me.

215
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:01,060
We'll go together.

216
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:02,740
You can...

217
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:05,500
You can hang it yourself. Okay?

218
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:17,740
Why are you crying?

219
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,380
I

220
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,060
should have died long ago.

221
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:27,540
Back then,

222
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:30,020
my senior brother prolonged my life

223
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:32,180
with his.

224
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:34,180
Even then,

225
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:36,940
I am but on my last breath.

226
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,940
I've only lived
because of medicinal liquor.

227
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:43,140
Dongjun.

228
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:45,700
When we

229
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:49,100
carry a lot of things on our shoulders,

230
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:51,740
we won't be that free.

231
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,540
My wish is rather contradictory.

232
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,660
I want you

233
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,380
to be free

234
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:01,140
and carefree.

235
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:06,460
Yet I hope you can
make a name for yourself

236
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:08,700
and be a true hero.

237
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:11,540
Sure.

238
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:14,580
I promise you.

239
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:16,460
But you must live

240
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,660
till that day arrives.

241
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:21,260
Dongjun,

242
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:23,180
a dragon

243
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:25,660
will have to soar to the sky one day.

244
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:27,540
A hero

245
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:29,180
will shine wherever he goes.

246
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:32,660
It doesn't matter

247
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:35,780
whether I'm there or not.

248
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:37,940
No.

249
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:39,860
Master.

250
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:51,300
Remember

251
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:53,420
the first time

252
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:54,820
you barged into this courtyard?

253
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,740
I took a liking to you immediately.

254
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,260
And decided

255
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:04,980
to take you in as my disciple.

256
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:07,700
Who would've thought

257
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:10,580
that you are the grandson
of Baili Luochen.

258
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:16,860
But it's too late
to regret anything now.

259
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:22,660
I've never

260
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:25,340
acted

261
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:26,260
on my impulses in my whole life.

262
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:30,500
That day was an exception.

263
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:36,500
Who are you?

264
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:38,340
How did you come in here?

265
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:40,060
Sorry.

266
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:41,700
I didn't mean
to intrude upon this place.

267
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:44,340
I am trying to hide from my family.

268
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:46,060
For some reason,

269
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:48,060
they hire another tutor to teach me.

270
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:49,860
I kept running

271
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:50,900
until I came here, mister.

272
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,340
Now that I think about it,

273
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,380
perhaps this is fate.

274
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:04,900
Master.

275
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:25,500
This is a royal poinciana.

276
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:31,740
The national tree of Western Chu.

277
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:35,180
However, phoenixes

278
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:37,780
only reside on parasol trees.

279
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:41,300
People may call me a deity,

280
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:44,980
but as Western Chu fell,

281
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,700
I shall have no place to stay.

282
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,260
You know liquor?

283
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:09,740
In the future,

284
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,380
I want to become the Liquor Deity!

285
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:27,460
Dongjun.

286
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:31,220
Life is full of partings.

287
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:35,420
You will encounter

288
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:37,340
many more

289
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:38,340
partings like this.

290
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:51,860
Please be my tutor.

291
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,540
Please teach me how to brew liquor.

292
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:11,860
Farewell, my dear disciple.

293
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:21,860
Master.

294
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:24,980
Master.

295
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:26,900
Master.

296
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:30,340
Master.

297
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:33,980
Master.

298
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:37,220
Master.

299
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:39,580
Master!

300
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:48,300
Father.

301
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,100
Master.

302
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,980
Master!

303
00:20:58,580 --> 00:20:59,380
Dongjun is...

304
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:00,500
Don't worry.

305
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:02,020
He has now

306
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:03,340
experienced...

307
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:04,780
Master.

308
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:07,260
the true taste
of the martial arts world.

309
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:10,180
The glamorous Eight Young Masters

310
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:11,620
are not the real martial arts world.

311
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,460
The romanticism of a swordsman
in Sword Forest

312
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,780
is not
the real martial arts world either.

313
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:18,780
Master.

314
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:21,540
Master!

315
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:26,060
Today,

316
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:28,380
he saw the true face

317
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:31,180
of the martial arts world.

318
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:43,340
Master.

319
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,580
Let's head back and cure the wound.

320
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:09,140
We'll wait for him

321
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:11,380
to come home.

322
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:44,120
[Marquis of Zhenxi's Mansion]

323
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:46,380
From now on,

324
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,020
the Scholarly Deity

325
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:48,740
who charmed everyone

326
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:50,660
with his genteelness

327
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:51,300
ceased to exist.

328
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:52,940
To his friends and foes,

329
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:54,580
it is

330
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,460
a tragic loss.

331
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:59,660
In fact, he could have lived.

332
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:00,500
Yes.

333
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,100
He could have lived.

334
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:05,020
He was surviving on his last breath.

335
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:06,740
If he hadn't performed that slash,

336
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:08,860
he might have lived
for several years more.

337
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:12,020
However, he didn't want to start a war

338
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:13,740
or betray his home country.

339
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:15,900
He didn't want
to implicate Marquis of Zhenxi either.

340
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:18,060
Therefore, he sacrificed himself

341
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,060
as

342
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:21,060
a solution.

343
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:22,980
Or we can follow a simpler

344
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:23,620
and

345
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:25,460
romantic interpretation.

346
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:29,300
Perhaps

347
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:31,980
this is the final lesson and love

348
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:33,780
from a master

349
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,020
to his disciple.

350
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:45,060
You often babble

351
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,060
but what you said just now

352
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:49,220
was good.

353
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:56,420
Was that sarcasm?

354
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:57,140
No, it wasn't.

355
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:01,180
Anyway, Ruofeng,

356
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:05,060
you were tasked to investigate this.

357
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:07,340
Now that the Scholarly Deity
passed away,

358
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:09,780
I'm sure you're smart enough

359
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:11,180
to come up

360
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:12,100
with a message

361
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:13,740
that can put
your father's worries to rest

362
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:14,580
and allow

363
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:16,300
Qiandong City to stay peaceful.

364
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:18,980
Which means we...

365
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:20,460
We're done

366
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:22,060
with the imperial court.

367
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:26,220
Now, it's about the Academy.

368
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:34,390
[Seven Days Later]

369
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:56,540
Have you reached a conclusion,

370
00:24:57,380 --> 00:24:58,540
Sir?

371
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:01,020
You must take Dongjun with you?

372
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:02,220
Yes.

373
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:05,980
But he's my only grandchild.

374
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:07,460
Sir.

375
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,580
I understand your concerns.

376
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:12,380
But like I said,

377
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:13,940
I came

378
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:14,940
on behalf

379
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:16,460
of the Academy.

380
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:18,340
This is different

381
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:19,780
from my visit

382
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,420
to Mr. Gu Chen.

383
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:23,980
I want Baili Dongjun

384
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:25,460
because I merely think

385
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:26,340
that

386
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:28,340
he is the final disciple

387
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:29,820
my master has been looking for.

388
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:33,260
My grandson is the one

389
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:34,620
I favor the most in this world.

390
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:37,540
My wish is to keep him away

391
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:38,780
from conflict and war.

392
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:41,620
I want him to live like a carefree

393
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:44,340
and pampered kid in Qiandong City.

394
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,940
Why must you

395
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:47,820
push him into the abyss?

396
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:49,500
I think only an idiot

397
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:51,020
can be carefree.

398
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:52,580
Insolence!

399
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:54,300
What did you say?

400
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,700
I told you not to say anything.

401
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:58,500
I said,

402
00:25:58,860 --> 00:25:59,660
only an idiot

403
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:01,180
could be carefree.

404
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:03,100
We all have to grow up.

405
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:04,260
When we grow up,

406
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:05,740
we cannot live our lives without worry.

407
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:07,580
He witnessed the passing of his master

408
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:08,780
not long ago.

409
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:10,100
Do you think he can pretend

410
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:11,340
that nothing has ever happened?

411
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:12,260
He can't.

412
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:14,380
Besides, he is the only heir

413
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:15,860
to the Western Chu's Sword Song.

414
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:17,060
All swordsmen in the world

415
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:18,220
are targeting him.

416
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:20,140
Can you

417
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:21,940
protect him forever?

418
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:26,820
When it comes to swordsmanship,

419
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:28,740
I fear no one even if
a powerful individual from the Academy

420
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:29,500
is here.

421
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:35,460
My spouse inherits
the art of toxins from the Wen Family.

422
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:37,060
In the martial arts world,

423
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:38,460
not many are a match for them.

424
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:40,060
If Dongjun wants to study martial arts,

425
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:41,820
he can study it here.

426
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:43,740
Even if he only masters 80% of it,

427
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:44,780
no one can hurt him.

428
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:47,740
What about Mr. Li of the Academy?

429
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:50,420
Ask him to come here

430
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:51,380
to talk to me personally.

431
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:54,420
He's being unreasonable.

432
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:58,140
If I were a reasonable man,

433
00:26:58,340 --> 00:26:59,740
my son wouldn't be like this.

434
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:03,980
Sir,

435
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:05,460
I think

436
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:08,700
my senior brother makes some sense.

437
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:11,420
If Dongjun studies swordsmanship here,

438
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:12,580
he will always

439
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:14,100
be a noble young master.

440
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:15,620
He can be powerful

441
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:16,980
but not

442
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,420
hardened.

443
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:20,420
Without experiencing life or death,

444
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:22,660
he falls easily.

445
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:26,980
Furthermore,

446
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:28,220
Baili Dongjun is now

447
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:29,740
the target of a group

448
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:30,500
of unidentified people.

449
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:31,380
Yesterday,

450
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:33,500
we were ambushed by them

451
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:35,020
at Mr. Gu Chen's abode.

452
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:37,820
They are of dubious background

453
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:39,340
yet strong.

454
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:40,500
Not only

455
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,100
did they want
to take away Mr. Gu Chen,

456
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:43,980
but they also wanted
to take Dongjun away.

457
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:47,740
You are surrounded

458
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:49,100
by enemies.

459
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:52,820
You can protect him once,

460
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:56,660
but how many more times?

461
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:06,860
I also heard

462
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:08,300
from Chengfeng yesterday

463
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,140
that those people fought

464
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:12,100
with unseen techniques.

465
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:13,300
What a pickle.

466
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:16,300
Sir,

467
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:18,740
you have traveled far away

468
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:20,900
to hone your skills back then.

469
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:23,340
Why? Were there no more
skilled individuals in this vast mansion

470
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:25,020
to tutor you?

471
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:30,700
Tianqi City

472
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:33,460
is certainly a competitive city.

473
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:34,980
However...

474
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:40,780
It is also the best stage

475
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:43,260
for the young to make achievements.

476
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:49,300
I have faith in Baili Dongjun.

477
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,640
You are right,

478
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,520
but I do not agree with it.

479
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:14,560
How about this?

480
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,760
We'll ask Dongjun about his opinion.

481
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:18,600
Father.

482
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:20,640
Wise choice, Sir.

483
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,720
Sirs,

484
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,320
bad news.

485
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,520
Young Master took a horse

486
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,320
and ran away.

487
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:34,320
Great!

488
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:35,520
Well done!

489
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:42,680
Sir.

490
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:45,960
If I did not

491
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,600
want him to head to Tianqi City,

492
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:51,520
I wouldn't have wasted your time here.

493
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:53,640
Where did he go?

494
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,120
Did he leave the city?

495
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,480
No.

496
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:59,120
He said he wanted
to travel around Qiandong City.

497
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,320
Forgive me.

498
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,040
Never mind.

499
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,040
Let's take a look.

500
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,040
[Pastries]
Young Master Baili,

501
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,160
where are you going?

502
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Nowhere.

503
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,320
I just want to ride a horse.

504
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,080
I have fresh red date cakes.

505
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,080
Catch it.

506
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,120
Young Master Baili,

507
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,440
how long will you ride for?

508
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,680
Till sunset,

509
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,240
till the stars appear,

510
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,120
till this steed

511
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,640
explores

512
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,480
the whole of Qiandong City.

513
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,760
Sir, should we go after him?

514
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:47,640
Yes.

515
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,160
Do it slowly.

516
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,280
Don't catch up to him.

517
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:53,320
Come on, sir.

518
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,040
You have never caught up to him either.

519
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,080
I don't care about those times.

520
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,360
But this time, we can't catch up to him.

521
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,160
This time,

522
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,200
we're tailing him

523
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,160
to protect him.

524
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,280
He's a steed

525
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,080
that will not be easily tamed.

526
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,440
It seems like he already knows

527
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,600
if he's heading to Tianqi City or not.

528
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:17,800
Some people are like that.

529
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,280
He joins the army and becomes a general.

530
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,160
He studies hard
and becomes the top scholar.

531
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:23,760
And if he practices martial arts,

532
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,000
he will become
the strongest martial artist.

533
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:27,920
No need to ask what he can do.

534
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:30,840
It all depends on what he wants to do.

535
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,800
With a promising heir like that,

536
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,320
what are you afraid of,

537
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,760
Sirs?

538
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,280
Your Highness.

539
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,200
Are you sure you're taking

540
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,120
Dongjun away

541
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,120
for the Academy only?

542
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,560
Yes.

543
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,200
All right.

544
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,320
Dongjun is heading to Tianqi City.

545
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:56,320
But I don't want him

546
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,800
to be involved in state affairs.

547
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,520
Can you give me that promise?

548
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,080
Fret not, Sir.

549
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:06,080
I'll swear with my life.

550
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,440
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

551
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,640
Not bad. He's decisive.

552
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,200
Just like that time

553
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,160
when Gu Jianmen

554
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,440
and I went to Tianqi City by horse.

555
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,680
Madam?

556
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,160
What brings you here?

557
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,360
Madam.

558
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,520
What are you doing?

559
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,040
I invented this poison myself.

560
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,880
Its name is Pleasant Death.

561
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,400
If Dongjun comes back

562
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,640
safely,

563
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,480
I'll give you the antidote.

564
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,400
If something bad happens to him...

565
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:09,280
Worry not.

566
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,120
Victims of Pleasant Death

567
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,680
will die in a very pleasant way.

568
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:41,680
Here I go.

569
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,320
Tianqi!

570
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,280
Young Master, I, Chen Sheng,

571
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:48,240
wish you a triumphant return!

572
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:49,960
- The Pofeng Army
- The Pofeng Army

573
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,800
- wishes you a triumphant return!
- wishes you a triumphant return!

574
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,200
- The Pofeng Army
- The Pofeng Army

575
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:57,080
- wishes you a triumphant return!
- wishes you a triumphant return!

576
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,080
Sikong Changfeng.

577
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,200
People might think you went
to the mountains to fight someone,

578
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,600
if they don't know what's happening.

579
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,160
Look at you.

580
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,200
You don't look

581
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:14,280
like a physician apprentice at all.

582
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:15,800
I'm not a physician apprentice.

583
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,120
Xin Baicao.

584
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,600
If you call me that again,

585
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,240
I'll knock you out

586
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:21,080
with my spear.

587
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:25,440
The herbs you want are here.

588
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:26,280
You can take a look.

589
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,480
You have a talent for studying medicine.

590
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,160
You gathered the exactly right herbs.

591
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:41,440
Now, brew the broth

592
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:43,880
using the prescription I gave you.

593
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:44,640
What?

594
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:52,520
I gathered the herbs.

595
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:53,880
And now, I have to brew it on my own.

596
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,000
I am the most hardworking patient
in this world.

597
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,200
Did you pay me?

598
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:57,720
No.

599
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:58,720
Then,

600
00:34:58,720 --> 00:34:59,960
you have to brew the medicine yourself.

601
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,320
Do it yourself.

602
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,960
Is there even carrier pigeon
in the Drug King Valley?

603
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,200
Of course.

604
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,680
But this missive

605
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:19,680
is for you.

606
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,080
For me?

607
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:29,520
"Are you still alive, Sikong Changfeng?"

608
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,120
How straightforward.

609
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:34,800
"If you're alive,

610
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,600
don't meet me at Qiandong City.

611
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:37,920
I left for Tianqi City.

612
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,520
Do drop by one day
to try my new liquor."

613
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:44,480
That's all?

614
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,520
What an interesting person.

615
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,200
Who is he?

616
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:48,320
Well,

617
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:50,800
he's the man I told you about.

618
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:54,040
He's Marquis of Zhenxi's only grandson,
Baili Dongjun.

619
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,000
But why

620
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,400
did he leave Qiandong City this soon?

621
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,040
I thought his family

622
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,760
didn't allow him to go to Tianqi City?

623
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:03,000
He didn't explain anything
in the missive.

624
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:04,440
It seems

625
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,160
you care a lot about him.

626
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,520
Of course.

627
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,120
He's a good friend of mine.

628
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:10,760
All right.

629
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,680
Once you inherit half of my knowledge,

630
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,400
you may head to Tianqi City.

631
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,160
Young people

632
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:17,960
all want to head there.

633
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,800
In fact, everyone should
visit there once.

634
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,800
It's a city full of talents.

635
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,080
It's also a place

636
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,400
where the young
make a name for themselves.

637
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,560
Does that mean

638
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,400
you too went to Tianqi City

639
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:29,920
when you were young?

640
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,120
Back then,

641
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:39,960
the Emperor fell sick.

642
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,800
No one from the Imperial Academy
of Medicine could cure him.

643
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,640
Within three days,
more than ten physicians were killed.

644
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,680
My master sent me to treat him.

645
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,520
Inside the chamber
was a near-death emperor.

646
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:48,280
Outside

647
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:50,040
was arms-wielding guards

648
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,440
ready to drag me out and decapitate me.

649
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,080
But my hand with an acupuncture needle
inside it

650
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,680
did not tremble.

651
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,080
I cured the Emperor.

652
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,480
And I said,

653
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,560
as long as the person still breathed,

654
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:01,920
I could

655
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,440
heal him.

656
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:05,960
Interesting.

657
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:09,480
I will

658
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,440
head to Tianqi City too.

659
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,560
Do you know why

660
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,800
he refused to sit inside here?

661
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,600
Didn't he explain already?

662
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
He's made a pact with someone

663
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,080
to admire the landscape

664
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,240
on the journey.

665
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,120
Really?

666
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:06,440
You actually believe that?

667
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:07,640
Isn't it obvious?

668
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:08,760
Imagine.

669
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,080
You came all the way

670
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,080
from Tianqi City

671
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:11,760
to arrest his master.

672
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,120
And now, his master is dead.

673
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,040
Naturally, he'll put

674
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:14,960
the blame on you.

675
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,600
In a way,

676
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,480
you're the reason
why his master died.

677
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:21,800
Arresting his master

678
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,280
and his master's passing

679
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,120
are two different things.

680
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,520
If he cannot distinguish them,

681
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:30,560
then he isn't

682
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:31,520
who I'm looking for,

683
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:32,920
nor is he the disciple

684
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,240
Master has been looking for.

685
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:36,440
Fine.

686
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:37,520
Now, look.

687
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,400
He's

688
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,040
just

689
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,160
a young and inexperienced boy.

690
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,600
Do you think

691
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:42,440
everyone is

692
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,120
as ruthless as...

693
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:47,520
I mean, As shrew as you

694
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,320
at the age of 18?

695
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,800
After crossing the hill ahead there,

696
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,200
we won't see Qiandong City

697
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,000
again.

698
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:23,920
When I was little,

699
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,160
I thought Qiandong City was huge.

700
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:27,920
That I could never see every part of it.

701
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:29,960
When I grew up, I thought

702
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:31,400
Qiandong City

703
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,240
wasn't that big.

704
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,160
Travel half a day on horseback

705
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:35,520
and you'll see everything.

706
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:37,640
And now,

707
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,120
I truly feel
that Qiandong City is small.

708
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,400
It's so small that if I venture further,

709
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,200
I won't see it again.

710
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,120
Then...

711
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,960
Did you bid
your parents farewell properly?

712
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,320
They refused to see me.

713
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,120
They said they'd only greet me

714
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,080
once I came back triumphantly.

715
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,200
My grandfather said something to me.

716
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:02,160
He said that if I was bullied,

717
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,160
I should write to him.

718
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,640
Then, he'd bring his Pofeng Army

719
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:05,960
to raid Tianqi

720
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:07,080
and vindicate me.

721
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:12,440
Your grandfather is indeed heroic.

722
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,120
But I won't ask him to do that.

723
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:16,800
That would be rebellion, right?

724
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:19,400
Therefore,

725
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:20,760
